1
00:00:09,813 --> 00:00:12,534
[SPEAKER_04]: Where were you when Killer Instinct returned one decade ago?

2
00:00:12,534 --> 00:00:15,996
[SPEAKER_04]: I was on the second floor of a building in San Francisco in an orange shipping crate.

3
00:00:15,996 --> 00:00:18,657
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't worry, it wasn't closed, and it wasn't used for shipping.

4
00:00:18,657 --> 00:00:24,500
[SPEAKER_04]: Shortly after its 10-year anniversary, we've learned that the PC version is adopting the payment model that its Xbone counterpart always had.

5
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:28,202
[SPEAKER_04]: Free to play with one character, pay to unlock all content at any time.

6
00:00:28,202 --> 00:00:29,522
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the Breath of Life update.

7
00:00:29,522 --> 00:00:34,885
[SPEAKER_04]: Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Sommers, and Loki to also mention the story and talk about the rest of the week's gaming news.

8
00:00:34,885 --> 00:00:37,086
[SPEAKER_04]: Starting right now in the show, wherever gamer has a voice,

9
00:00:38,953 --> 00:00:41,576
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello, my friends out there on the internet.

10
00:00:41,576 --> 00:00:46,101
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

11
00:00:46,101 --> 00:00:48,344
[SPEAKER_01]: It is Orange Lounge Radio.

12
00:00:48,344 --> 00:00:55,532
[SPEAKER_01]: We are back once again tonight with our show, episode number 984 for tonight, December the 3rd of 2023.

13
00:00:55,532 --> 00:00:57,194
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right, folks.

14
00:00:57,194 --> 00:00:59,636
[SPEAKER_01]: It's December and the year is almost over.

15
00:01:00,197 --> 00:01:07,819
[SPEAKER_01]: But we've got lots of video games to talk about tonight with myself, Rob Roberts, and my co-hosts here with me live every week on Sunday nights.

16
00:01:07,819 --> 00:01:08,359
[SPEAKER_01]: Say hello.

17
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:16,880
[SPEAKER_01]: First and foremost, hanging out in the fog by the campfire, the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

18
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:17,841
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello, hello.

19
00:01:17,841 --> 00:01:23,642
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like we see your peace sign, but you are muted on Discord because I see the little icon, the joys of doing the virtual stuff.

20
00:01:26,478 --> 00:01:28,720
[SPEAKER_07]: I just found something really disturbing.

21
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,583
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I love disturbing.

22
00:01:31,583 --> 00:01:37,869
[SPEAKER_07]: I was putting in my tags for Twitch and believe Jewish women is not allowed.

23
00:01:39,184 --> 00:02:07,195
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting is it I wonder if I can put the me too unless you're a Jew is it one of those like weird loopholes where it's just too long or do I don't I literally do not know it's interesting okay it won't let me add that either hmm I don't know um we use very boring ones here like podcast and uh twitch stream let me do the abbreviated one all right um but still

24
00:02:08,666 --> 00:02:10,528
[SPEAKER_01]: Never making an abbreviated appearance.

25
00:02:10,528 --> 00:02:13,012
[SPEAKER_01]: Say hello to the one and only Techmaster Loki.

26
00:02:13,012 --> 00:02:14,354
[SPEAKER_05]: There's nothing abbreviated about me.

27
00:02:14,354 --> 00:02:15,636
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

28
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:16,137
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, how are you?

29
00:02:17,165 --> 00:02:17,865
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm fine.

30
00:02:17,865 --> 00:02:20,847
[SPEAKER_01]: And okay, so you love to play these games.

31
00:02:20,847 --> 00:02:23,288
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, at least have gameplay behind you.

32
00:02:23,288 --> 00:02:35,295
[SPEAKER_01]: As we tape live at Sunday nights at nine o'clock Eastern, six o'clock Pacific at the Voice Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash VOG Network, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show, where we're at every single Sunday night.

33
00:02:35,295 --> 00:02:39,897
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you are watching live, I know many of you listen on the podcast feed, and we do appreciate you.

34
00:02:39,897 --> 00:02:43,259
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you to all of you that showed up in our Spotify wrapped this week.

35
00:02:43,699 --> 00:02:56,984
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, we got to, I don't know if you know this, but when you produce content for Spotify, you get a little rap that shows you the top countries that listen to your show and go figure the US and the United Kingdom are number one and number two.

36
00:02:56,984 --> 00:02:58,004
[SPEAKER_01]: How about that?

37
00:02:58,004 --> 00:03:03,046
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, uh, anyway, uh, Loki, uh, you have a game that plays behind you.

38
00:03:03,046 --> 00:03:03,726
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, what is this?

39
00:03:03,726 --> 00:03:05,686
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I, I don't know if I recognize this.

40
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:06,847
[SPEAKER_05]: This is Broforce.

41
00:03:08,537 --> 00:03:14,519
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I think I played, I think this was like a free game on Xbox Gold or something.

42
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:17,500
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I played just a hot minute of it.

43
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,200
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, I didn't care for it.

44
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:19,821
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.

45
00:03:19,821 --> 00:03:23,162
[SPEAKER_01]: But is this, is this a game that you enjoy?

46
00:03:23,162 --> 00:03:23,582
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a game.

47
00:03:23,582 --> 00:03:30,504
[SPEAKER_05]: It's in my library amongst all of those other games that I don't play the hundreds and hundreds of them.

48
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:54,640
[SPEAKER_05]: so um allegedly uh you you have played this game but not really i have never played this game yeah it's in my backlog actually i may have booted it up at one time because i i know my um fellow channel 64 cast members have wanted to play this multiplayer and um we should that oh you know what i should have put on there you know

49
00:03:55,307 --> 00:04:00,250
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I've been watching lots of videos of it, as I should have done a long play of Lethal Company.

50
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:03,152
[SPEAKER_05]: That looks fun.

51
00:04:03,152 --> 00:04:04,513
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks... it's strange.

52
00:04:04,513 --> 00:04:06,454
[SPEAKER_05]: It's also another game I probably won't actually play.

53
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:07,635
[SPEAKER_05]: It seemed like Phasmo.

54
00:04:07,635 --> 00:04:09,456
[SPEAKER_05]: I just haven't played that.

55
00:04:09,456 --> 00:04:18,603
[SPEAKER_05]: But Lethal Company looks a little bit more interesting to me because it's got more of a Backrooms, SCP vibe to it, versus just ghost hunting, which is...

56
00:04:19,465 --> 00:04:26,431
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, as a person who's done ghost hunting in real life once, um, it's all right.

57
00:04:26,431 --> 00:04:28,393
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I wouldn't do it again.

58
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:30,715
[SPEAKER_01]: As a seasoned ghost hunter, that one time I did it.

59
00:04:30,715 --> 00:04:35,880
[SPEAKER_05]: As a seasoned, I mean, compared to like the people on TV, yes, I am absolutely a seasoned ghost hunter.

60
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:43,667
[SPEAKER_05]: But, um, yeah, I just rather like the backrooms SCP stuff's more interesting than ghost hunting is.

61
00:04:43,667 --> 00:04:44,048
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotcha.

62
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:54,078
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my gosh, alright, well let's get into our show tonight and we're gonna get right into our kickoff topic for tonight which is a pretty big story.

63
00:04:54,078 --> 00:05:06,849
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a big deal for multiple reasons and one of the reasons I think this is a big deal is I'm seeing this shared on social media by people that don't usually, I peg as people that follow the video game industry at least closely.

64
00:05:07,489 --> 00:05:17,931
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in that audience of people who play Mario Kart and Jackbox games at a party and played Pokemon Go a couple times in the summer of 2016.

65
00:05:17,931 --> 00:05:19,951
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that type, which there's nothing wrong with that type of gamer.

66
00:05:19,951 --> 00:05:21,372
[SPEAKER_01]: We love a casual gamer.

67
00:05:21,372 --> 00:05:26,753
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm seeing lots of people sharing this story on social media.

68
00:05:26,753 --> 00:05:34,654
[SPEAKER_01]: Loki, would you care to tell us a little bit about the fuckery going on in the world of Hollywood meets video games this week?

69
00:05:35,054 --> 00:05:41,260
[SPEAKER_05]: So the long and short of it is it like a lot of people are pointing blame at Sony and it's not Sony.

70
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:55,233
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Warner Discovery or just I don't know if it's just Discovery now, but it's Discovery, their shit show that is involved now with other content platforms, because what's going on basically is, you know,

71
00:05:55,876 --> 00:05:56,957
[SPEAKER_05]: on the PS4, PS5, PS4U, PS5, PS5, PS5, PS5, PS5, PS5,

72
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:11,140
[SPEAKER_01]: probably

73
00:06:28,231 --> 00:06:32,112
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, Naked and Afraid, that one I've heard of, because nudity is always going to get my attention.

74
00:06:32,112 --> 00:06:32,513
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.

75
00:06:32,513 --> 00:06:35,134
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, you know, because I watch me some Food Network.

76
00:06:35,134 --> 00:06:36,694
[SPEAKER_05]: So there was like Cake Boss.

77
00:06:36,694 --> 00:06:37,714
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't like Cake Boss.

78
00:06:37,714 --> 00:06:39,575
[SPEAKER_05]: I am more of a Duff Goldman fan.

79
00:06:39,575 --> 00:06:41,976
[SPEAKER_05]: I will die on that hill.

80
00:06:41,976 --> 00:06:47,578
[SPEAKER_05]: Shark Week stuff, CS to the Dress, you know, that trashy stuff.

81
00:06:47,578 --> 00:06:51,219
[SPEAKER_05]: Long Island Medium, going back to that Ghost Hunt team nonsense.

82
00:06:51,219 --> 00:06:52,740
[SPEAKER_01]: No, not the Long Island Medium.

83
00:06:54,586 --> 00:06:57,548
[SPEAKER_05]: Deadly Women, but more, you know, like actual shows people watch.

84
00:06:57,548 --> 00:06:59,930
[SPEAKER_05]: Mythbusters, for example, was part of that.

85
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:16,663
[SPEAKER_05]: So what basically happened with this is actually, so because Discovery and Sony are having a kerfuffle about digital rights and stuff like that, they are now going to be removing their content off the platform.

86
00:07:16,663 --> 00:07:20,907
[SPEAKER_05]: But unlike games that get delisted, for example, on Sony's platforms,

87
00:07:21,807 --> 00:07:24,950
[SPEAKER_05]: They are actually taking this out of your library.

88
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:34,559
[SPEAKER_05]: And this isn't shows that like people are paying like a monthly fee for, you know, PlayStation Now or whatever plus, um, to get access to it.

89
00:07:34,559 --> 00:07:41,925
[SPEAKER_05]: These are shows that like you went and purchased this, you downloaded it and it's supposed to be in your library.

90
00:07:41,925 --> 00:07:45,008
[SPEAKER_05]: But then now they're like, well, no, we're taking that back.

91
00:07:46,129 --> 00:07:48,990
[SPEAKER_05]: It literally cannot be on your platform at all.

92
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:51,391
[SPEAKER_05]: Which they feel that they should be refunding you at that point.

93
00:07:51,391 --> 00:07:52,072
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?

94
00:07:52,072 --> 00:07:53,612
[SPEAKER_01]: That was my next logical question.

95
00:07:53,612 --> 00:07:54,373
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're not!

96
00:07:54,373 --> 00:08:01,296
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I spent $15, I don't even know what the cost is, but I'm gonna say, let's say I spent $15 to get the first full season of Cake Boss.

97
00:08:01,676 --> 00:08:06,017
[SPEAKER_01]: because I just, I need my cake inspirations on demand.

98
00:08:06,017 --> 00:08:13,258
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to be able to, you know, see these cakes, freeze frame the cakes so I can recreate the cakes, nailed it, you know, that whole thing on my time.

99
00:08:13,258 --> 00:08:26,241
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're saying that Warner Brothers Discovery is literally, literally, literally going to sneak into my house in the middle of the night, take it out of my home and put it back in their vault.

100
00:08:27,268 --> 00:08:29,149
[SPEAKER_01]: Merry Christmas.

101
00:08:29,149 --> 00:08:30,449
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy Hanukkah.

102
00:08:30,449 --> 00:08:31,790
[SPEAKER_01]: Merry Kwanzaa.

103
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:33,670
[SPEAKER_05]: So yes, all of it.

104
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:50,817
[SPEAKER_05]: They basically said as of December 31st, 2023, due to our licensing or our content licensing agreements with content providers, you will no longer be able to watch any of your previously purchased Discovery content and the content will be removed from your video library.

105
00:08:50,817 --> 00:08:53,618
[SPEAKER_05]: We sincerely thank you for your continued support.

106
00:08:53,618 --> 00:08:56,679
[SPEAKER_05]: That sounds just like Konami like last week or so with the

107
00:08:57,139 --> 00:09:03,904
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, hey, you're banned from this tournament, but please, please, please use our products still, you know.

108
00:09:03,904 --> 00:09:11,350
[SPEAKER_01]: But even when Konami removed PT from the store, they didn't go on my PlayStation and remove it there.

109
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:20,177
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, the ability to get that demo and still play it on a PlayStation is like that, that underground thing that cool people

110
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,022
[SPEAKER_01]: Try to do to impress their friends.

111
00:09:23,022 --> 00:09:25,846
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, oh yeah, I got a PlayStation 4 that still plays PT.

112
00:09:25,846 --> 00:09:28,129
[SPEAKER_01]: Wanna see the trailer?

113
00:09:28,129 --> 00:09:30,532
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's still a power move, right?

114
00:09:30,532 --> 00:09:32,315
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't erase it from your place.

115
00:09:32,315 --> 00:09:34,458
[SPEAKER_01]: They probably would have if they could have.

116
00:09:35,253 --> 00:09:41,758
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's probably what it's weird a little bit that Warner Brothers Discovery can do this.

117
00:09:41,758 --> 00:09:45,861
[SPEAKER_01]: And I understand before I because I know somebody's typing a correction in chat right now.

118
00:09:45,861 --> 00:09:48,023
[SPEAKER_01]: So stop before you hit enter.

119
00:09:48,023 --> 00:09:53,847
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that little fine print that we all agree to when we sign up for the store.

120
00:09:53,847 --> 00:09:54,588
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to.

121
00:09:54,588 --> 00:09:58,050
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that little fine print does give them the right to do this.

122
00:09:58,050 --> 00:09:58,671
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in there.

123
00:09:58,671 --> 00:09:59,952
[SPEAKER_01]: If you actually read through it.

124
00:10:00,853 --> 00:10:02,857
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, Ranma, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

125
00:10:11,104 --> 00:10:11,864
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, exactly.

126
00:10:11,864 --> 00:10:16,666
[SPEAKER_05]: Because if you think about it, like, what is this saying then for piracy?

127
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:24,550
[SPEAKER_05]: Piracy now is giving you a better experience than doing the right thing and purchasing your content legally.

128
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:30,593
[SPEAKER_05]: Because piracy, you can download, like, and this is, there was a video that was done by

129
00:10:31,913 --> 00:10:33,154
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I don't remember the guy.

130
00:10:33,154 --> 00:10:35,537
[SPEAKER_05]: The guy that does Mac repair stuff all the time.

131
00:10:35,537 --> 00:10:38,580
[SPEAKER_05]: He's an advocate for, like, write the repair and all that.

132
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:39,280
[SPEAKER_05]: Lewis Rossman.

133
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:51,652
[SPEAKER_05]: So, Lewis Rossman was talking about how he decided to subscribe to Netflix, their 4K package, because he wanted to stream 4K video on his TV.

134
00:10:51,652 --> 00:10:54,295
[SPEAKER_05]: And apparently, because his TV

135
00:10:55,436 --> 00:10:57,479
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, VOG Network, Ranma, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

136
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:39,036
[SPEAKER_05]: and you would have to have like specific devices and specific ways to do that in order to actually get the content and he's like well I'm paying for 4k and you're serving me 720p I am getting a worse experience than if I go on the internet and just go download this and it will be 4k and I can play it on any device I want to it doesn't matter I am not limited by all of these loopholes that you're or all these loop hoops that you're making me jump through it's stupid so once again

137
00:11:39,056 --> 00:11:39,316
[SPEAKER_05]: again

138
00:11:56,368 --> 00:12:03,335
[SPEAKER_05]: through these legitimate avenues that you offered your content through because you're being a little whiny bitch about it.

139
00:12:03,335 --> 00:12:07,620
[SPEAKER_05]: Now you're saying that you're giving the green light to everybody to go pirate your shit.

140
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:13,165
[SPEAKER_05]: Not that you really should because it's pretty crap, a lot of it, but that's basically what you're doing.

141
00:12:13,165 --> 00:12:16,409
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if you really want to pirate Kate Boss, like, don't share that.

142
00:12:17,324 --> 00:12:26,729
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, like, okay, here's some of the wonderful series that are on here that I have never heard of, but, like, they're basically, I mean, it's like TLC bullshit.

143
00:12:26,729 --> 00:12:31,731
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I think Discovery owns TLC as well, but, like, Graveyard Cars.

144
00:12:31,731 --> 00:12:33,032
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

145
00:12:33,032 --> 00:12:36,073
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, Gypsy Sisters.

146
00:12:36,073 --> 00:12:37,614
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, Here Comes Honey Boo Boo.

147
00:12:37,614 --> 00:12:38,535
[SPEAKER_05]: Ooh, yeah.

148
00:12:38,535 --> 00:12:40,876
[SPEAKER_01]: We weren't supposed to say that word, anyway.

149
00:12:40,876 --> 00:12:41,836
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, they called it a TV show.

150
00:12:41,836 --> 00:12:43,897
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the name of a show.

151
00:12:43,897 --> 00:12:45,058
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't doubt it.

152
00:12:45,058 --> 00:12:45,358
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

153
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:50,611
[SPEAKER_05]: It that's the they have four seasons of I'm kidding.

154
00:12:50,611 --> 00:12:51,192
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm kidding.

155
00:12:51,192 --> 00:12:52,012
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

156
00:12:52,012 --> 00:12:59,034
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, you know, Hillbilly Summer, Hoarding, Buried Alive.

157
00:12:59,034 --> 00:13:00,134
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, I get we get it.

158
00:13:00,134 --> 00:13:00,595
[SPEAKER_01]: We get it.

159
00:13:00,595 --> 00:13:13,419
[SPEAKER_01]: These are these are definitely like crap niche shows that people only watch when they're high and want to feel better about their own lives because there's, you know, people out there that have it worse, I guess is basically how you'd sum up a lot of those shows.

160
00:13:13,419 --> 00:13:14,219
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um,

161
00:13:16,149 --> 00:13:18,510
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, this is, this is, this is crappy.

162
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:19,991
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to drive people to piracy.

163
00:13:19,991 --> 00:13:23,373
[SPEAKER_01]: There will be a lawsuit anyway, even though people have agreed that there will be a lawsuit.

164
00:13:23,373 --> 00:13:24,014
[SPEAKER_01]: But guess what?

165
00:13:24,014 --> 00:13:25,415
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know what that lawsuit's going to do?

166
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,941
[SPEAKER_01]: Not a goddamn thing.

167
00:13:27,941 --> 00:13:31,862
[SPEAKER_01]: That lawsuit is going to get some lawyers paid, seven figures.

168
00:13:31,862 --> 00:13:38,305
[SPEAKER_01]: But those of you that spent $15 on a season for Honey Boo Boo, for whatever reason, that's your fucking right.

169
00:13:38,305 --> 00:13:45,928
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to buy Here Comes Honey Boo Boo Season 1, God damn it, as an American, that is your Canadian or wherever else this marketplace is at.

170
00:13:45,928 --> 00:13:49,090
[SPEAKER_01]: That's your right to buy that and enjoy at your leisure.

171
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:50,410
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have that right.

172
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:53,011
[SPEAKER_01]: But do you know what you are going to get for spending 15 bucks?

173
00:13:53,011 --> 00:13:54,072
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to get anything.

174
00:13:54,352 --> 00:14:02,676
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to get a pat on the ass, told a job well done and a 99 cent coupon to use at the one remaining block store or blockbuster store in America.

175
00:14:02,676 --> 00:14:03,117
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.

176
00:14:03,117 --> 00:14:04,757
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what you're going to get from that settlement.

177
00:14:04,757 --> 00:14:06,278
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing of actual use.

178
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:11,301
[SPEAKER_05]: And here's the thing though, too, about this is like, you have to understand that like, this is something that can happen anywhere.

179
00:14:11,301 --> 00:14:18,745
[SPEAKER_05]: So like I was, you know, talking about this with some friends and they're like, Oh yeah, I've got all these videos on VUDU.

180
00:14:18,745 --> 00:14:21,806
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, literally that service could just up and disappear one day.

181
00:14:21,806 --> 00:14:23,127
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

182
00:14:23,127 --> 00:14:23,247
[SPEAKER_05]: And

183
00:14:24,181 --> 00:14:25,742
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's all gone.

184
00:14:25,742 --> 00:14:26,623
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

185
00:14:26,623 --> 00:14:28,504
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, it's just gone.

186
00:14:28,504 --> 00:14:29,825
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the problem with digital.

187
00:14:29,825 --> 00:14:33,728
[SPEAKER_05]: Digital is, you have to trust the content partners for it.

188
00:14:33,728 --> 00:14:37,811
[SPEAKER_05]: And honestly, like, when it comes to movie studios and stuff, I don't trust anybody.

189
00:14:37,811 --> 00:14:41,274
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody should trust Warner Brothers Discovery at this point for anything.

190
00:14:41,534 --> 00:14:41,614
[SPEAKER_01]: and

191
00:15:08,618 --> 00:15:14,341
[SPEAKER_01]: That's very important as well as that trust, because I look at a platform like Steam.

192
00:15:14,341 --> 00:15:23,185
[SPEAKER_01]: Steam has come out and said, why do we all spend oogles of money that we probably shouldn't be spending just to inflate our Steam backlog with games we should never play?

193
00:15:23,185 --> 00:15:30,788
[SPEAKER_01]: Because Steam has said, and it is in their terms, if Steam ever goes away, those games will be yours.

194
00:15:30,788 --> 00:15:34,330
[SPEAKER_01]: The DRM button gets pushed and those games are yours for all eternity.

195
00:15:35,149 --> 00:15:36,009
[SPEAKER_05]: Allegedly.

196
00:15:36,009 --> 00:15:39,091
[SPEAKER_01]: Assuming the servers will still work for those games.

197
00:15:39,091 --> 00:15:41,792
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking at a thing like Dead by Daylight.

198
00:15:41,792 --> 00:15:44,233
[SPEAKER_01]: Someday, someday, Behaviour is going to say no.

199
00:15:44,233 --> 00:15:45,733
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be Behaviour servers.

200
00:15:45,733 --> 00:15:46,153
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.

201
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:47,654
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be Behaviour and not Steam.

202
00:15:47,654 --> 00:15:50,435
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is, that is, you know, whatever company you're trusting.

203
00:15:51,195 --> 00:16:10,350
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkTetsuya case and point in chat says AntStream and a lot of you aren't keeping tabs on this service cause it's a little bit, you know, it's niche, it's retro cloud, right?

204
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:15,154
[SPEAKER_01]: AntStream already has lost the WB Midway stuff.

205
00:16:16,147 --> 00:16:23,936
[SPEAKER_01]: So those classic Midway games, including Mortal Kombat, that were originally on the Anstream service, they are no longer available.

206
00:16:23,936 --> 00:16:33,126
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, that situation is a little different because when you're paying for the cloud access, like a Netflix night, like a Hulu, you know, the games come and go.

207
00:16:33,126 --> 00:16:36,690
[SPEAKER_01]: So nobody's going to be able to set, you know, you could decide if you want to renew Anstream or not.

208
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:37,231
[SPEAKER_01]: However,

209
00:16:38,382 --> 00:16:40,644
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely, again, we're talking about that company loyalty.

210
00:16:40,644 --> 00:16:43,906
[SPEAKER_01]: It's showing where WB is laying their hand right now.

211
00:16:43,906 --> 00:16:44,847
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's be real.

212
00:16:44,847 --> 00:16:48,549
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure there are lots of hardworking, wonderful people at Warner Brothers Games.

213
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:49,850
[SPEAKER_01]: There's lots of great people.

214
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:55,915
[SPEAKER_01]: So we should really call the problem what it is, and that is David Zaslav is the problem.

215
00:16:58,402 --> 00:17:13,073
[SPEAKER_01]: another billionaire who gets away with billionaire shit and tax write-offs like that Batgirl movie that was gonna be diverse, fun, looked great, gets pulled to be a tax write-off.

216
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:14,434
[SPEAKER_05]: A Scooby-Doo sequel even?

217
00:17:14,434 --> 00:17:14,795
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.

218
00:17:14,795 --> 00:17:16,156
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the animated thing?

219
00:17:16,156 --> 00:17:16,776
[SPEAKER_01]: You name it.

220
00:17:16,776 --> 00:17:25,203
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a ton of shit out there that so David Zaslav can pocket more money with a tax write-off.

221
00:17:26,485 --> 00:17:29,410
[SPEAKER_01]: And let's call, again, David?

222
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:32,074
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds like the name of the Bond villain.

223
00:17:32,074 --> 00:17:37,463
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just saying this on Bobby's show, it sounds like the villain in the Superman movies, Neil before Zaslav.

224
00:17:37,463 --> 00:17:40,147
[SPEAKER_01]: I think if I go back and watch it, that's what I'm going to hear from now on.

225
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:45,295
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, and Dark to See Us is the Wile E. Coyote Acme movie we lost out on too.

226
00:17:45,295 --> 00:17:47,577
[SPEAKER_01]: And people, I know, I already know the internet.

227
00:17:47,577 --> 00:17:53,623
[SPEAKER_01]: I already know the fucking blue checks on Twitter and what they would say in response to this if I bothered to fucking read that hellhole anymore.

228
00:17:53,623 --> 00:17:58,008
[SPEAKER_01]: And that would be, you're upset about a movie you didn't get to see?

229
00:17:58,008 --> 00:17:58,308
[SPEAKER_01]: Really?

230
00:17:58,308 --> 00:17:59,950
[SPEAKER_01]: You're upset about a movie you didn't get to see?

231
00:18:01,532 --> 00:18:03,433
[SPEAKER_01]: Excuse me, bitch.

232
00:18:03,433 --> 00:18:08,054
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm upset for all those hardworking people that worked on that movie.

233
00:18:08,054 --> 00:18:18,198
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm upset for that actress who is really excited to play Batgirl and take on that role, who now doesn't get to do that on that platform because a billionaire needed to have another fucking yacht.

234
00:18:18,198 --> 00:18:21,159
[SPEAKER_01]: And the laws of this country let him get away with it.

235
00:18:21,159 --> 00:18:29,622
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the politicians, I'm sorry, the politicians out there have literal fucking brain worms in the rocks between their ears.

236
00:18:30,382 --> 00:18:34,609
[SPEAKER_01]: and focus on bullshit that doesn't matter in this country.

237
00:18:34,609 --> 00:18:38,334
[SPEAKER_01]: And this includes, I could go on and on because this includes the fucking media.

238
00:18:38,334 --> 00:18:42,120
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't give a fuck about George Santos.

239
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:45,385
[SPEAKER_01]: Never put him on my TV screen again.

240
00:18:45,385 --> 00:18:45,765
[SPEAKER_01]: Never.

241
00:18:47,006 --> 00:18:50,567
[SPEAKER_01]: I know he will be on Dancing with the Stars next season and this upsets me already.

242
00:19:13,143 --> 00:19:15,244
[SPEAKER_07]: George Santos is a moron.

243
00:19:44,117 --> 00:19:59,129
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's anything, it's, you know, just the people are not looking at things that are actually important to what we do here in the U.S., you know.

244
00:19:59,129 --> 00:20:05,814
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're blaming the first factor that comes up.

245
00:20:05,814 --> 00:20:08,777
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is human nature is to always look for a scapegoat, you know.

246
00:20:09,775 --> 00:20:14,638
[SPEAKER_07]: But they point fingers at the wrong parties.

247
00:20:14,638 --> 00:20:19,521
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's what I mean, that's kind of what they're doing with with this situation you were talking about, right?

248
00:20:19,521 --> 00:20:20,762
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

249
00:20:20,762 --> 00:20:26,406
[SPEAKER_01]: Fifth Ream in chat says it's good to keep an eye on a horrible people in power to make sure they don't get away with it.

250
00:20:26,406 --> 00:20:33,070
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the problem and it's not that I disagree with you, but the problem is these fucking billionaires keep getting away with it time and time again.

251
00:20:33,737 --> 00:20:36,601
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's getting old.

252
00:20:36,601 --> 00:20:37,602
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know what?

253
00:20:37,602 --> 00:20:38,904
[SPEAKER_01]: I do not feel bad.

254
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:44,271
[SPEAKER_01]: My point is, I do not feel bad at this point about pirating anything about WB or Discovery.

255
00:20:46,047 --> 00:20:49,929
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, you know, I know we're not supposed to talk about piracy.

256
00:20:49,929 --> 00:20:51,170
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not something we're supposed to promote.

257
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:52,590
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, then you tell me.

258
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:59,814
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, the thing that really shocks me in this whole scenario is that somehow that Batgirl movie hasn't leaked, or any of the other projects that have been named.

259
00:20:59,814 --> 00:21:06,357
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm hung up on Batgirl because I used to fucking love Batman and Batgirl, the 60s show that was rerun when I was a kid and all that stuff.

260
00:21:06,357 --> 00:21:09,759
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, my point is, I'm surprised that shit hasn't leaked to the internet.

261
00:21:10,379 --> 00:21:17,744
[SPEAKER_01]: And that, I really, really, really need somebody in Hollywood who has the ability to do it, to leak that shit to the internet.

262
00:21:17,744 --> 00:21:18,945
[SPEAKER_01]: Please do it.

263
00:21:18,945 --> 00:21:21,367
[SPEAKER_01]: Please do it.

264
00:21:21,367 --> 00:21:29,753
[SPEAKER_03]: All it takes is one hacker to go in there and start dumping stuff.

265
00:21:29,753 --> 00:21:31,214
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like Sony all over again.

266
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:38,587
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, um, yeah, so I know it's it's just TV shows and so forth.

267
00:21:38,587 --> 00:21:40,209
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's it's it's the precedent.

268
00:21:40,209 --> 00:21:43,534
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the fact that they can take something away from you that you bought and why

269
00:21:44,696 --> 00:21:44,776
[SPEAKER_01]: and

270
00:22:07,705 --> 00:22:14,132
[SPEAKER_05]: On paper maybe you can do that, but the IRS or somebody's gotta go like, wait a second, we gotta look into that.

271
00:22:14,132 --> 00:22:16,074
[SPEAKER_05]: That seems a little fishy.

272
00:22:16,074 --> 00:22:26,524
[SPEAKER_01]: And before we get the emails saying there's nothing proving that this particular decision is based on a tax write-off, I would still say that at the end of the day it's all culminating to the bottom line.

273
00:22:26,624 --> 00:22:36,660
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it was a, if it was a, you know, residual disagreement or something or some sort of like Warner felt like they weren't getting enough money from the PlayStation Store, then fine, remove your shit from the store.

274
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:39,305
[SPEAKER_01]: Why are they taking it off of people's devices?

275
00:22:39,305 --> 00:22:40,647
[SPEAKER_01]: They shouldn't have to go that far.

276
00:22:41,966 --> 00:22:44,187
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just, it's wild.

277
00:22:44,187 --> 00:22:44,967
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

278
00:22:44,967 --> 00:22:51,210
[SPEAKER_05]: The furthest we've seen this before, um, previously was where you'd have like your cable company or whatever.

279
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:58,333
[SPEAKER_05]: It'd be different cable providers and they would remove certain channels off of your, you'd be paying for them.

280
00:22:58,333 --> 00:23:00,234
[SPEAKER_01]: Satellite and channels.

281
00:23:00,234 --> 00:23:00,434
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

282
00:23:00,434 --> 00:23:01,194
[SPEAKER_01]: Local TV.

283
00:23:01,194 --> 00:23:01,875
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

284
00:23:01,875 --> 00:23:02,375
[SPEAKER_01]: All that stuff.

285
00:23:03,055 --> 00:23:11,346
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, it's... I mean, which is the same, because you're paying for everything, but you're not... you're getting less product, so... I mean, but it's... yeah.

286
00:23:11,346 --> 00:23:14,170
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess if you still... why?

287
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:17,534
[SPEAKER_05]: Want to support them, you buy physical media, um...

288
00:23:18,175 --> 00:23:45,985
[SPEAKER_05]: and that's kind of why like right there there's a perfect example why physical media will never go away it's because these companies are saying hey you can't trust us to you know you you can't trust us to allow you to give us money and then we give you the product that you get to keep it's just you know it's not a guarantee whereas at least if i purchase a physical piece of media it's mine until it breaks so i don't know

289
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:57,236
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, not only now not only do you need a piece of physical media, but you need to be able to back up that physical media in case like you said it breaks or because because otherwise, you're going to lose that thing forever someday.

290
00:23:57,236 --> 00:24:02,999
[SPEAKER_01]: So and that's that's to even do you think you can buy Honey Boo Boo and a physical edition anymore?

291
00:24:03,803 --> 00:24:04,804
[SPEAKER_05]: No, but they're doing that.

292
00:24:04,804 --> 00:24:08,327
[SPEAKER_05]: They're doing you a favor for selling out of the store.

293
00:24:08,327 --> 00:24:09,829
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm sure you probably can.

294
00:24:09,829 --> 00:24:13,873
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, people have it and then they sell it secondhand.

295
00:24:13,873 --> 00:24:16,155
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, you know, and that's the other thing too.

296
00:24:16,155 --> 00:24:19,358
[SPEAKER_05]: Secondhand with physical media, you can get it cheaper.

297
00:24:19,358 --> 00:24:21,781
[SPEAKER_05]: Like there's a negotiation process there.

298
00:24:21,781 --> 00:24:22,041
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean,

299
00:24:23,621 --> 00:24:24,081
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

300
00:24:24,081 --> 00:24:26,162
[SPEAKER_05]: I love digital in the sense that it's convenient.

301
00:24:26,162 --> 00:24:38,944
[SPEAKER_05]: When it comes to like small indie games and stuff like that, I will support people like that with Steam and all that, but yeah, buying stuff digitally on like platforms, like even on my PlayStation 4 and stuff, it's great.

302
00:24:38,944 --> 00:24:45,946
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm on PlayStation 4, but now whenever I get a PlayStation 5 or 6 or whatever, am I going to be able to access that stuff?

303
00:24:45,946 --> 00:24:46,706
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably not.

304
00:24:48,015 --> 00:24:52,538
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because I don't think you can actually access PlayStation 3 bot stuff on your 5 or anything.

305
00:24:52,538 --> 00:24:55,360
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that did change some time ago.

306
00:24:55,360 --> 00:25:00,003
[SPEAKER_01]: DJRamaS in chat says, there was a call for a federal investigation of WBD, Warner Bros.

307
00:25:00,003 --> 00:25:02,805
[SPEAKER_01]: Discovery, after the whole Wile E. Coyote movie debacle.

308
00:25:02,805 --> 00:25:03,166
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?

309
00:25:03,166 --> 00:25:09,130
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember that because I remember a lot of people were laughing at it going, isn't there a better use of our government's time?

310
00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:12,792
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think this should make everybody give pause and say, you know, it's the precedent.

311
00:25:12,792 --> 00:25:13,613
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, maybe

312
00:25:14,073 --> 00:25:18,937
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe we do need to look into the underlying issue, which is why are they getting tax write-offs?

313
00:25:18,937 --> 00:25:21,999
[SPEAKER_01]: Why is David Zaslav allowed to do this?

314
00:25:21,999 --> 00:25:25,842
[SPEAKER_05]: And to answer the question, whether is it a good use of their time or not?

315
00:25:25,842 --> 00:25:26,482
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, it is.

316
00:25:26,482 --> 00:25:31,006
[SPEAKER_05]: Because the reason why we have departments out there that this is what they do.

317
00:25:31,006 --> 00:25:35,569
[SPEAKER_05]: They look into antitrust and corporate malpractice and stuff like that.

318
00:25:35,569 --> 00:25:37,030
[SPEAKER_05]: And that is their purpose.

319
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:39,733
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not like we're asking the Senate to look into it.

320
00:25:39,733 --> 00:25:41,054
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, who cares what they think?

321
00:25:41,054 --> 00:25:42,915
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, there are other bodies out there that

322
00:25:43,395 --> 00:26:07,135
[SPEAKER_05]: They're regulatory bodies that look into these type of things because yeah, it's a major loophole if you have a company that's essentially Finding it like a free money glitch type of thing by canceling projects when they're finished, you know Wouldn't you want to stop that so that we're not so us taxpayers aren't paying for you know Zaslav's fifth, you know House or whatever.

323
00:26:07,135 --> 00:26:10,898
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, come on like, of course, yeah, it's in the best interest of the people and

324
00:26:11,038 --> 00:26:16,799
[SPEAKER_01]: For anyone that thinks an investigation of the Wile E. Coyote movie is a waste of the government's time, I've got two fucking words for you.

325
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:17,880
[SPEAKER_01]: Hunter Biden.

326
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:20,960
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

327
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,061
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway.

328
00:26:23,061 --> 00:26:23,401
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's move on.

329
00:26:23,401 --> 00:26:29,022
[SPEAKER_05]: But you know what I hear is on his laptop, a full copy of Wile E. Coyote and the Roadrunner.

330
00:26:29,022 --> 00:26:30,383
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why they're after it.

331
00:26:30,383 --> 00:26:31,083
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so important.

332
00:26:33,777 --> 00:26:34,678
[SPEAKER_01]: I hate you, but I don't.

333
00:26:34,678 --> 00:26:35,118
[SPEAKER_01]: I love you.

334
00:26:35,118 --> 00:26:42,324
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, let's move on and talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing this week.

335
00:26:42,324 --> 00:26:43,886
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

336
00:26:46,033 --> 00:26:47,294
[SPEAKER_07]: It was the usual.

337
00:26:47,294 --> 00:26:52,238
[SPEAKER_07]: I played some Dead by Daylight, I played Rudra no Hiho.

338
00:26:52,238 --> 00:26:56,421
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm getting done with the first scenario very soon.

339
00:26:56,421 --> 00:27:00,383
[SPEAKER_07]: And I played some Disney Dreamlight Valley.

340
00:27:00,383 --> 00:27:05,087
[SPEAKER_07]: The rest of my time, really, though, because we're gearing up for a recital and someone quit.

341
00:27:06,607 --> 00:27:14,879
[SPEAKER_07]: So we had to sit and redo most of the choreography and it took us two hours yesterday and we even ran through it.

342
00:27:14,879 --> 00:27:17,482
[SPEAKER_07]: We were working on this for a while.

343
00:27:17,482 --> 00:27:20,627
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm ready to scream.

344
00:27:20,627 --> 00:27:22,710
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, that's been

345
00:27:24,401 --> 00:27:34,270
[SPEAKER_07]: Sitting back and playing games, I don't want to play anything that's going to get me emotionally charged, because all I'm going to do is think about how irritated I am.

346
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:35,912
[SPEAKER_07]: Does that make sense?

347
00:27:35,912 --> 00:27:41,717
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm trying to play mostly easy, cozy things, but I am going to do Killer Night later.

348
00:27:44,755 --> 00:27:54,479
[SPEAKER_01]: Bobby Blackwolf in chat points out the ever surprising comment, I played Dead by Daylight 2 this week, but clarifying the pinball table in Pinball M, the M rated version of Pinball FX.

349
00:27:54,479 --> 00:27:57,059
[SPEAKER_01]: I had no idea that that came out, but apparently it did on Friday.

350
00:27:57,059 --> 00:27:57,840
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to check that out.

351
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,741
[SPEAKER_01]: That sounds fun.

352
00:28:00,741 --> 00:28:02,021
[SPEAKER_01]: I do love me some pinball.

353
00:28:02,021 --> 00:28:06,703
[SPEAKER_07]: Bonnie needs to play the Debbies with us.

354
00:28:06,703 --> 00:28:08,964
[SPEAKER_01]: He would hide in a locker the whole time and you know it.

355
00:28:08,964 --> 00:28:10,064
[SPEAKER_01]: And I say that with love.

356
00:28:10,064 --> 00:28:11,505
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

357
00:28:12,631 --> 00:28:15,513
[SPEAKER_07]: So, but would he play Dwight while he does it?

358
00:28:15,513 --> 00:28:18,195
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, probably because I don't see him.

359
00:28:18,195 --> 00:28:25,379
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the only way you would ever get him to play would be with a game pass version of the game, which only comes with like what the stock four heroes and bill.

360
00:28:25,379 --> 00:28:27,841
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes.

361
00:28:27,841 --> 00:28:28,381
[SPEAKER_01]: Bill.

362
00:28:28,381 --> 00:28:29,742
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

363
00:28:29,742 --> 00:28:32,864
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, uh, then Loki, we'll go to you and your gaming week.

364
00:28:33,912 --> 00:28:36,354
[SPEAKER_05]: My gaming week was just Minecraft.

365
00:28:36,354 --> 00:28:40,837
[SPEAKER_05]: I finished editing up a video for the RazeWorks server stuff.

366
00:28:40,837 --> 00:28:46,100
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm done with, well, I've been done with, for my Channel 64 content.

367
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:49,463
[SPEAKER_05]: I need to film a bunch of stuff for that.

368
00:28:49,463 --> 00:28:52,945
[SPEAKER_05]: Now someone pranked one of my builds, so I gotta film more content for that.

369
00:28:52,945 --> 00:28:54,906
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm hoping to work on that this week.

370
00:28:54,906 --> 00:29:01,791
[SPEAKER_05]: I started also actually editing the newest episode of the RazeWorks server as well.

371
00:29:01,791 --> 00:29:03,112
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, we did like a live

372
00:29:03,912 --> 00:29:05,433
[SPEAKER_05]: MC Rewind

373
00:29:24,818 --> 00:29:33,842
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's supposed to be like kind of like YouTube Rewind in the sense they're going to have a video that they put out for it, but it's also just a server with people playing together.

374
00:29:33,842 --> 00:29:46,667
[SPEAKER_05]: So I have to design builds for that at some point here very soon because it kicks off in exactly two weeks from yesterday, the 16th.

375
00:29:46,667 --> 00:29:48,268
[SPEAKER_05]: So it runs for a month.

376
00:29:51,223 --> 00:29:53,264
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, well, let's see my gaming week.

377
00:29:53,264 --> 00:30:03,131
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to talk a little bit about what I did today, because I went out today for a variety of events that were happening in AR games I play.

378
00:30:03,131 --> 00:30:06,033
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think you all know that I love to play the AR games.

379
00:30:06,033 --> 00:30:11,696
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of them happen to be made by Niantic, though I'm certainly open to trying games of a certain quality by other companies.

380
00:30:11,696 --> 00:30:15,479
[SPEAKER_01]: I've talked a lot about Orna on this show and some other games as well.

381
00:30:15,479 --> 00:30:20,442
[SPEAKER_01]: But today was kind of focused on the Niantic stuff, which for whatever reason, they tend to all kind of happen at once.

382
00:30:20,942 --> 00:30:26,306
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was a Pikmin Bloom event happening today for walking 10,000 steps to get a badge there.

383
00:30:26,306 --> 00:30:26,746
[SPEAKER_01]: So great.

384
00:30:26,746 --> 00:30:27,627
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to move around.

385
00:30:27,627 --> 00:30:28,227
[SPEAKER_01]: Fine.

386
00:30:28,227 --> 00:30:31,309
[SPEAKER_01]: But there was also concurrent events going on in Pokemon Go.

387
00:30:31,309 --> 00:30:43,238
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this is the one most of our listeners probably know about because there was the Suiyan, I think if I'm saying that right, Samurott, that is available only today in raids.

388
00:30:43,238 --> 00:30:47,120
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of people were getting together to go raid together between, I think it's

389
00:30:48,121 --> 00:30:48,542
[SPEAKER_01]: 2PM and 5PM.

390
00:31:05,822 --> 00:31:08,464
[SPEAKER_01]: I deserve this because I always get screwed in these events.

391
00:31:08,464 --> 00:31:11,065
[SPEAKER_01]: So today, today's my special day.

392
00:31:11,065 --> 00:31:12,066
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was very happy about that.

393
00:31:12,066 --> 00:31:27,354
[SPEAKER_01]: But the fun thing was, is that we were also, while we were doing that, we were also trying to play Monster Hunter Now, which had a black Diablos event going on, which that monster isn't usually in the game, but was only doing it today.

394
00:31:27,354 --> 00:31:28,054
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes, we would

395
00:31:28,374 --> 00:31:35,378
[SPEAKER_01]: We would try to drive around looking for desert biomes, then pull over, because we just did it in neighborhoods, because Monster Hunter now is everywhere.

396
00:31:35,378 --> 00:31:39,780
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'd pull over in front of somebody's house, take down the black Diablos, and then move on to the next one.

397
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:43,182
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were doing all of that.

398
00:31:43,182 --> 00:31:46,943
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when we ended up at a park, we were walking around playing Pokemon Go.

399
00:31:48,144 --> 00:32:02,926
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's my kind of point with all this is that when we were doing one of the raids, you know, there were other people there doing it too, which is interesting, because we were at a place that, like, usually for these events, people go downtown Capital Park, that's like the place you expect to see people.

400
00:32:02,926 --> 00:32:04,187
[SPEAKER_01]: We were we were in a park

401
00:32:04,668 --> 00:32:08,669
[SPEAKER_01]: in South Sacramento, because that's where our adventures on Monster Hunter took us.

402
00:32:08,669 --> 00:32:12,810
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was a whole marathon going on downtown today, which was kind of in the way and annoying anyway.

403
00:32:12,810 --> 00:32:13,930
[SPEAKER_01]: So we kind of wanted to get away from that.

404
00:32:13,930 --> 00:32:18,871
[SPEAKER_01]: So we went more south of that, and we were randomly raiding with some other people.

405
00:32:18,871 --> 00:32:29,493
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we were talking about walking over to some other gyms, this girl who had jumped in the last raid with us was like, hey, can I join your next raid or whatever?

406
00:32:29,493 --> 00:32:31,194
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have a crew to do it with.

407
00:32:31,194 --> 00:32:32,814
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, yeah, sure, of course, you can do it.

408
00:32:33,394 --> 00:32:36,356
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and so we scanned her into the party.

409
00:32:36,356 --> 00:32:36,776
[SPEAKER_01]: We did that.

410
00:32:36,776 --> 00:32:40,519
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we found out through that she also plays Monster Hunter now.

411
00:32:40,519 --> 00:32:48,344
[SPEAKER_01]: So while we were walking to the gyms, we were doing the Black Diablos as a foursome now instead of a threesome with my friends and all that.

412
00:32:48,344 --> 00:32:56,329
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I just happened to notice while we were doing like one of the last raids, I noticed that she had a bag that said Final Fantasy Fan Festival.

413
00:32:56,329 --> 00:32:59,652
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, holy shit, were you in Vegas at the fan festival?

414
00:32:59,652 --> 00:33:00,692
[SPEAKER_01]: She's like, I was.

415
00:33:00,692 --> 00:33:02,954
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, oh man, this was the first year that I couldn't go.

416
00:33:03,414 --> 00:33:11,799
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we were talking about that, we were doing games and whatever, and she actually, and this is really funny because I never talked about the fact that I do a podcast or any of this stuff, but she actually was like, do you like Emmett Selk?

417
00:33:11,799 --> 00:33:13,280
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, of course.

418
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:15,902
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, sorry, I just hit a button that caused my computer to freeze.

419
00:33:15,902 --> 00:33:16,642
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, there we go.

420
00:33:16,642 --> 00:33:17,703
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully we didn't lose any frames.

421
00:33:19,284 --> 00:33:20,744
[SPEAKER_01]: She's like, do you like Emmett Selk?

422
00:33:20,744 --> 00:33:24,366
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, if you've ever played FF14, yes, you like Emmett Selk.

423
00:33:24,366 --> 00:33:28,487
[SPEAKER_01]: He's the bad guy, but in one of those, like, maybe he has a point kind of things.

424
00:33:28,487 --> 00:33:38,390
[SPEAKER_01]: So he actually gave me, or I'm sorry, she actually gave me a little sticker that I guess she must do art or something, and actually gave me this little sticker of Emmett Selk.

425
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:45,712
[SPEAKER_01]: And my point is, this was all because of Pokemon Go and meeting up and doing these things.

426
00:33:45,712 --> 00:33:46,512
[SPEAKER_01]: So I will say this.

427
00:33:47,588 --> 00:33:53,658
[SPEAKER_01]: for all the shit that we've given Niantic about the return to real world and doing things in person and all this stuff.

428
00:33:53,658 --> 00:33:59,669
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do still totally agree that the remote raid stuff they did, you know, reverting changes is never a good thing.

429
00:33:59,669 --> 00:34:00,170
[SPEAKER_01]: However,

430
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:06,863
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe they do have a point sometimes about getting people out into the real world and join up together and do these things.

431
00:34:06,863 --> 00:34:10,586
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you do get cool interactions like this that happened today.

432
00:34:10,586 --> 00:34:13,187
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, now, and now we're Pokemon Go friends.

433
00:34:13,187 --> 00:34:19,071
[SPEAKER_01]: And I found out she's on the, the server where I started playing 14, Midgarcimer.

434
00:34:19,071 --> 00:34:19,812
[SPEAKER_01]: She's on Midgarcimer.

435
00:34:19,812 --> 00:34:20,592
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where she plays.

436
00:34:20,592 --> 00:34:22,073
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's not a lot of people on that server.

437
00:34:22,073 --> 00:34:23,514
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was like, wow, small world.

438
00:34:23,514 --> 00:34:27,637
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean, that's, that was a feel good gaming story for me today.

439
00:34:27,637 --> 00:34:29,698
[SPEAKER_01]: Like making a new friend because of Pokemon Go for real.

440
00:34:30,489 --> 00:34:38,739
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's nice to have those interactions, but I know that's not Niantic's motivation for those changes, it's money, so... No, of course it is, of course it is.

441
00:34:38,739 --> 00:34:44,627
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean... My friend had to buy potions because she ran out and doing the Black Diablos, so, of course, of course.

442
00:34:44,627 --> 00:34:44,947
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm-hmm.

443
00:34:44,947 --> 00:34:45,147
[SPEAKER_01]: So...

444
00:34:46,569 --> 00:34:50,371
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike Deft in chat says, I think it's not that people don't want this.

445
00:34:50,371 --> 00:34:52,692
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more like giving people options to do so.

446
00:34:52,692 --> 00:34:53,213
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.

447
00:34:53,213 --> 00:34:54,494
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do agree.

448
00:34:54,494 --> 00:34:59,177
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, we were also when we were doing these raids, I was remote inviting anyone that I saw online.

449
00:34:59,177 --> 00:35:01,718
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, Deft, you actually got in one of our raids that we were doing.

450
00:35:01,718 --> 00:35:05,381
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was actually as we were walking around doing those.

451
00:35:05,381 --> 00:35:06,681
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that was those.

452
00:35:06,681 --> 00:35:10,704
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I caught my second shiny on that raid you were in, Deft, actually, now that I think about it.

453
00:35:10,704 --> 00:35:11,605
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah.

454
00:35:11,605 --> 00:35:13,526
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was just inviting whoever I saw online.

455
00:35:13,826 --> 00:35:17,889
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I sent SSJ100Matt like seven raid invites because I was like, well, he's on the East Coast.

456
00:35:17,889 --> 00:35:19,309
[SPEAKER_01]: It's already over out there.

457
00:35:19,309 --> 00:35:22,992
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think at some point I figured out, oh, he probably just doesn't have any remote passes.

458
00:35:22,992 --> 00:35:26,234
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just invite whoever I see.

459
00:35:26,234 --> 00:35:31,937
[SPEAKER_01]: Never feel you have to accept those invites because I never do because I refuse to buy remote raid passes.

460
00:35:31,937 --> 00:35:35,460
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's unless the game gives me one for free.

461
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:36,460
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm never going to do it.

462
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:37,601
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's that.

463
00:35:38,536 --> 00:35:40,658
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, well hope you got some shinies, Deft.

464
00:35:40,658 --> 00:35:56,751
[SPEAKER_01]: By the way, I did check in with Shane, because if you do know, our Pokemon-loving friend, Pokemon-obsessed friend Shane, does play Pokemon Go when there's something that interests him in it, and Oshawott is like his favorite Pokemon.

465
00:35:56,751 --> 00:35:58,353
[SPEAKER_01]: So he loves the whole line, right?

466
00:35:58,353 --> 00:35:59,834
[SPEAKER_01]: So he loves Samurott and all that, right?

467
00:36:01,485 --> 00:36:17,492
[SPEAKER_01]: So today was a big day for him, and I did get the update that, and I'm gonna quote the text message here so I get it right, 33 raids, 2 broke on the catch screen, but they weren't shiny, 5 of them were shiny.

468
00:36:17,492 --> 00:36:21,393
[SPEAKER_01]: So that means he caught 26 regulars and 5 shinies.

469
00:36:21,393 --> 00:36:23,854
[SPEAKER_01]: You math that out.

470
00:36:23,854 --> 00:36:25,715
[SPEAKER_01]: You were curious how hard people went today.

471
00:36:27,102 --> 00:36:36,006
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I did maybe 10 raids tops, but all of us in our little group got at least one shiny that we were walking around with, so that was fun.

472
00:36:36,006 --> 00:36:36,826
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, but that was fun.

473
00:36:36,826 --> 00:36:37,506
[SPEAKER_01]: That was my gaming week.

474
00:36:37,506 --> 00:36:40,908
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, oh, I guess there is one other thing I should talk about during my gaming week.

475
00:36:40,908 --> 00:36:43,369
[SPEAKER_01]: This is another interesting... Sorry, I'm taking up time, but oh well.

476
00:36:43,369 --> 00:36:45,590
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually played some different games.

477
00:36:45,590 --> 00:36:50,072
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, this one's not different, but I played World of Warcraft because...

478
00:36:51,587 --> 00:36:59,053
[SPEAKER_01]: In World of Warcraft Classic right now, they're doing this thing called the Season of Discovery that just started Thursday.

479
00:36:59,053 --> 00:37:03,897
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's the old school World of Warcraft with zero expansions, right?

480
00:37:03,897 --> 00:37:09,382
[SPEAKER_01]: But the level cap is 25 to force people to pace themselves a little bit.

481
00:37:09,382 --> 00:37:13,685
[SPEAKER_01]: And they've added this new system that didn't exist in Classic WoW.

482
00:37:14,707 --> 00:37:23,338
[SPEAKER_01]: So now it's Classic WoW Plus because now there is a rune system that works like enchanting that gives your character different abilities that they might not have otherwise.

483
00:37:23,338 --> 00:37:27,903
[SPEAKER_01]: And with these abilities, mages can now heal if they want.

484
00:37:27,903 --> 00:37:33,230
[SPEAKER_01]: Rogues and shamans and warlocks can all now tank if they want with these abilities.

485
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:36,652
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm playing a balanced druid for the lulz.

486
00:37:36,652 --> 00:37:43,056
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the abilities, for example, you get Sunfire, which was an ability I don't think they introduced until Cataclysm.

487
00:37:43,056 --> 00:37:46,498
[SPEAKER_01]: But with the rune, you can actually get Sunfire, which you can get early on.

488
00:37:46,498 --> 00:37:50,541
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's neat that they're kind of putting a twist on classic WoW.

489
00:37:50,541 --> 00:37:57,585
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm really into it, even though I also really miss the quality of life perks that modern MMOs bring.

490
00:37:58,826 --> 00:38:02,328
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, there's a certain amount of charm to it that I'm actually really enjoying.

491
00:38:02,328 --> 00:38:06,411
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reality is Final Fantasy 14 is super in a lull for me right now.

492
00:38:06,411 --> 00:38:08,793
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done everything I'm going to do in the Diablo 4 season.

493
00:38:08,793 --> 00:38:10,994
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like now is the right time for this to happen.

494
00:38:10,994 --> 00:38:12,655
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I'm into it.

495
00:38:12,655 --> 00:38:14,397
[SPEAKER_01]: I got up to level 12.

496
00:38:14,397 --> 00:38:15,657
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I'm at right now.

497
00:38:15,657 --> 00:38:17,058
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll probably log in later.

498
00:38:17,058 --> 00:38:20,381
[SPEAKER_01]: But I, I have to get my last steps in for Pikmin Bloom.

499
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:27,765
[SPEAKER_01]: So as soon as the show is done, I have to go walk the neighborhood in the dark to get my last thousand steps I need to get the stupid medal for today because I'm not letting it pass by.

500
00:38:27,765 --> 00:38:28,226
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm not.

501
00:38:29,266 --> 00:38:37,250
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, Questbuster in chat says, it sounds a little like the blood abilities from Diablo 4 that can buff up your toon in wild ways for this season.

502
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:44,153
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but it kind of has that extra perk of like letting characters do roles they wouldn't normally do, like a mage healer.

503
00:38:44,153 --> 00:38:46,574
[SPEAKER_01]: That's that's weird, but it's it's fun.

504
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:48,956
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what's fun about the whole season of Discovery.

505
00:38:48,956 --> 00:38:54,038
[SPEAKER_01]: So for as much shit as Blizzard gets for turning all of their content into season passes,

506
00:38:54,518 --> 00:38:57,921
[SPEAKER_01]: that you're seeing in Overwatch, that you're seeing in Diablo.

507
00:38:57,921 --> 00:39:04,066
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, interestingly enough, I'm kind of surprised Warcraft doesn't have a Season Pass.

508
00:39:04,066 --> 00:39:05,748
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just what they're calling the Season Discovery.

509
00:39:05,748 --> 00:39:08,030
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think in that case, they're still getting your sub.

510
00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:10,852
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to have an active sub to play WoW Classic, but that's all you need.

511
00:39:10,852 --> 00:39:12,634
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to buy any actual WoW.

512
00:39:12,634 --> 00:39:14,656
[SPEAKER_01]: You just have to pay that sub, but they're still getting that money.

513
00:39:14,656 --> 00:39:18,079
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess, you know, ain't nothing free.

514
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:20,441
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I'm enjoying it enough.

515
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:20,741
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fun.

516
00:39:22,453 --> 00:39:27,259
[SPEAKER_01]: Questbuster in chat says, I was super curious why so many streamers were doing WoW recently, but this explains it.

517
00:39:27,259 --> 00:39:28,240
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds like a fun system.

518
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,582
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it just launched Thursday.

519
00:39:30,582 --> 00:39:35,187
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, you probably had a lot of streamer friends that were doing it Thursday, Friday and on into this weekend.

520
00:39:35,187 --> 00:39:38,330
[SPEAKER_01]: So and probably keep doing it if they bring out drops or something as well.

521
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:42,762
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, well we have some stories to get into.

522
00:39:42,762 --> 00:39:45,824
[SPEAKER_01]: I first want to make sure I also shout out happening this week.

523
00:39:45,824 --> 00:39:48,186
[SPEAKER_01]: So we do have a few news stories for you tonight.

524
00:39:48,186 --> 00:39:55,091
[SPEAKER_01]: There's still some things going on in the gaming industry, but I do want to point out this week's going to be a big week in gaming news, right?

525
00:39:55,091 --> 00:39:58,073
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got the Game Awards coming up on Thursday.

526
00:39:58,073 --> 00:40:03,638
[SPEAKER_01]: We will be doing a live stream here at the Voice Geeks Network for the Game Awards, so if you want to watch along with us,

527
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:10,662
[SPEAKER_01]: And we try to, I promise, one thing we try to do, we're critical, but we're not overly negative.

528
00:40:10,662 --> 00:40:12,243
[SPEAKER_01]: There's very much a difference.

529
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:17,906
[SPEAKER_01]: So we try to keep it positive and fun and really about a celebration of games.

530
00:40:17,906 --> 00:40:19,067
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll be live streaming.

531
00:40:19,067 --> 00:40:21,248
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it'll be at least Bobby Blackwell and myself.

532
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:25,431
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if anyone else plans to join us, but they're more than welcome.

533
00:40:25,431 --> 00:40:28,292
[SPEAKER_01]: 4.30 Pacific, 7.30 Eastern on Thursday.

534
00:40:28,292 --> 00:40:32,175
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to be live streaming the Game Awards and get our reactions to all the stuff.

535
00:40:32,975 --> 00:40:33,816
[SPEAKER_01]: and all that good stuff.

536
00:40:33,816 --> 00:40:39,644
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll try to analyze things on the spot best we can and try to yeah, talk about all that good stuff on Thursday night.

537
00:40:39,644 --> 00:40:43,450
[SPEAKER_01]: So I hope you'll join us here at twitch.tv slash VOG Network.

538
00:40:45,626 --> 00:40:53,112
[SPEAKER_01]: Real quick comment from Mike Deft saying, speaking of Overwatch, after the conference they gave at Blizzcon, I bought Moira's Lilith skin with a battle pass.

539
00:40:53,112 --> 00:40:56,154
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, but they definitely sweet-talked me with all those promises.

540
00:40:56,154 --> 00:40:57,795
[SPEAKER_01]: I just hope they actually keep them.

541
00:40:57,795 --> 00:40:59,857
[SPEAKER_01]: As much as I love that skin, I did not buy it.

542
00:40:59,857 --> 00:41:02,879
[SPEAKER_01]: I've actually been playing more Overwatch than I talk about on this show.

543
00:41:02,879 --> 00:41:07,543
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a friend that's really into it and likes me to play with him, so he asked somebody to play.

544
00:41:07,543 --> 00:41:13,207
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got a play of the game this week with Junkrat, and it wasn't even a Riptire play.

545
00:41:13,607 --> 00:41:16,349
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like the first time in a long time I've gotten to play other games.

546
00:41:16,349 --> 00:41:17,370
[SPEAKER_01]: That made me feel really good.

547
00:41:17,370 --> 00:41:19,292
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I've been playing a little bit of Overwatch.

548
00:41:19,292 --> 00:41:20,633
[SPEAKER_01]: I love me a support hero.

549
00:41:20,633 --> 00:41:25,196
[SPEAKER_01]: My favorite heroes in the game right now are probably like Life Weaver is fucking great.

550
00:41:25,196 --> 00:41:27,418
[SPEAKER_01]: And Batiste, I love playing Batiste.

551
00:41:27,418 --> 00:41:29,320
[SPEAKER_01]: His heals are so good.

552
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:35,484
[SPEAKER_01]: And ever since I learned how to do the super jump so you can like launch in the air and then drop the heal bombs on people, I love it.

553
00:41:35,484 --> 00:41:37,906
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, yeah, Batiste is like probably my favorite hero to play right now.

554
00:41:37,906 --> 00:41:40,629
[SPEAKER_01]: So but yeah, lots of lots of fun in that game.

555
00:41:41,269 --> 00:41:44,623
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, let's get into some other gaming news.

556
00:41:44,623 --> 00:41:47,093
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll go over to Loki to start us off tonight.

557
00:41:48,055 --> 00:41:55,601
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, before we get into gaming news, I was going to say, I hope that this year for the Game Awards, they have better security for state on stage.

558
00:41:55,601 --> 00:42:02,006
[SPEAKER_05]: So that douchebag that like interrupted, you know, the whole thing isn't on there again.

559
00:42:02,006 --> 00:42:04,988
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty sure Keeley's been asked about this multiple times.

560
00:42:04,988 --> 00:42:08,030
[SPEAKER_01]: And yes, there will be enhanced security at the Game Awards this year.

561
00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:10,973
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially remember, same shit happened at Gamescom too.

562
00:42:11,893 --> 00:42:14,316
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, let's talk about some good that EA is doing.

563
00:42:33,032 --> 00:42:34,153
[SPEAKER_05]: That feels weird.

564
00:42:34,153 --> 00:42:48,468
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways, so EA has one of the things that EA does do that gets overshadowed by all the crappy things that EA does is that they have a lot of patents that they develop for accessibility features.

565
00:42:49,448 --> 00:42:56,991
[SPEAKER_05]: and they then make them available for other developers to use because it's just helping the gaming industry.

566
00:42:56,991 --> 00:43:10,197
[SPEAKER_05]: So the latest of this is actually Iris, a photosensitivity tool that automatically analyzes and identifies specific frames that could trigger an epileptic episode for folks.

567
00:43:10,197 --> 00:43:11,638
[SPEAKER_05]: As they have

568
00:43:13,214 --> 00:43:27,413
[SPEAKER_05]: As outlined by UK's Epilepsy Society and the US's Epilepsy Foundation, about 5 people on the globe have epilepsy and are photosensitive, so this basically allows them to develop games

569
00:43:28,174 --> 00:43:33,660
[SPEAKER_05]: that don't have, I guess, cutscenes or gameplay that would trigger this type of thing.

570
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:42,528
[SPEAKER_05]: They can kind of run this analysis through Iris and be able to tweak stuff so that it would be as safe as possible.

571
00:43:42,528 --> 00:43:45,651
[SPEAKER_05]: So that is pretty awesome.

572
00:43:45,651 --> 00:43:48,174
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, they've made it available and that's great.

573
00:43:49,281 --> 00:43:52,466
[SPEAKER_05]: So hopefully we'll see that implemented into other games.

574
00:43:52,466 --> 00:43:57,294
[SPEAKER_05]: So far, they said that it's been used in some of the EA games, including Madden 24, FC 24, and WRC.

575
00:44:01,158 --> 00:44:01,878
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's great.

576
00:44:01,878 --> 00:44:07,539
[SPEAKER_01]: No, making these types of accessibility things open is a good thing for the gaming industry.

577
00:44:07,539 --> 00:44:11,300
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, no hate on EA for this one.

578
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:18,181
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, I wish more companies would do this sort of thing and openly collaborate across the industry for these types of things.

579
00:44:18,181 --> 00:44:20,302
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that that would be a great thing.

580
00:44:20,302 --> 00:44:24,582
[SPEAKER_01]: Or even... At the end of the day, people move around the industry and end up at different companies and stuff.

581
00:44:24,582 --> 00:44:26,843
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is just a good thing to make our industry better.

582
00:44:27,563 --> 00:44:40,431
[SPEAKER_05]: or even just not necessarily just, you know, accessibility patents that could be opened up, like Namco could be non-douchebags and open up, you know, the whole allowing people to play minigames while the game is loading.

583
00:44:40,431 --> 00:44:47,535
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, granted, load times are like nothing nowadays, but, you know, who doesn't like a good minigame while things are processing and stuff?

584
00:44:48,914 --> 00:44:55,021
[SPEAKER_01]: And Mish in our chat says, I'm so glad because I have non-epileptic seizures and this helps a lot.

585
00:44:55,021 --> 00:45:01,188
[SPEAKER_01]: So these types of things do help people, you know, and games are for everyone.

586
00:45:01,188 --> 00:45:03,791
[SPEAKER_01]: So the more people we can bring to the table, the better.

587
00:45:03,791 --> 00:45:04,411
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah.

588
00:45:05,633 --> 00:45:10,737
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkTetsuya does say, to correct you Loki, that that patent did expire.

589
00:45:10,737 --> 00:45:13,499
[SPEAKER_01]: So that no longer is a patent they can have.

590
00:45:13,499 --> 00:45:20,344
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think you are ultimately right that now that we have solid state drives and all the consoles, you don't really have time for games on loading screens anymore anyway.

591
00:45:20,344 --> 00:45:21,765
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's true.

592
00:45:21,765 --> 00:45:23,747
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem kind of fixed itself in that regard.

593
00:45:25,939 --> 00:45:28,861
[SPEAKER_01]: But don't worry, Loki, I do have something to reset the palette.

594
00:45:28,861 --> 00:45:31,202
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have a story about EA being terrible.

595
00:45:31,202 --> 00:45:31,863
[SPEAKER_01]: Allegedly.

596
00:45:31,863 --> 00:45:37,787
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I am going to preface this with saying it's a Reddit post, and does that mean it's actually news?

597
00:45:37,787 --> 00:45:48,013
[SPEAKER_01]: Arguable, but since we do sometimes, especially on Slow News Week, talk about things that people are talking about on social media a lot too, and this is something that is getting shared a lot.

598
00:45:48,013 --> 00:45:49,935
[SPEAKER_01]: So I am going to bring it up here, and this is

599
00:45:51,035 --> 00:45:59,600
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody who allegedly had their EA account banned for a Steam purchase, writing on a Reddit post in the Steam Deck Reddit.

600
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:05,164
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, I'm posting this out of my own curiosity and kind of warning other members that might want to purchase an EA game.

601
00:46:05,164 --> 00:46:10,827
[SPEAKER_01]: My only gaming platform is the Steam Deck, and I wanted also to play some games with my girlfriend here and there.

602
00:46:10,827 --> 00:46:14,209
[SPEAKER_01]: I purchased on Steam Store the co-op game It Takes Two.

603
00:46:14,209 --> 00:46:15,430
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my only EA game.

604
00:46:16,010 --> 00:46:24,896
[SPEAKER_01]: A week later after beating the game, I got a mail from EA support about permanently banning my account for violating user agreements in terms of sale, whatever that might be.

605
00:46:24,896 --> 00:46:34,083
[SPEAKER_01]: I contacted support and their response, which was a second photo that basically said, tough shit, did not provide any concrete reason behind the action.

606
00:46:34,083 --> 00:46:36,865
[SPEAKER_01]: Did anyone else experience similar experiences?

607
00:46:36,865 --> 00:46:39,507
[SPEAKER_01]: Could it have some conflicting nature with Steam Deck being the platform?

608
00:46:40,757 --> 00:46:43,481
[SPEAKER_01]: So this has a lot of people talking about, God, EA's terrible.

609
00:46:43,481 --> 00:46:46,604
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't buy EA games on Steam, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

610
00:46:46,604 --> 00:46:50,970
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I, now my first instinct was like, is this isolated?

611
00:46:50,970 --> 00:46:57,378
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I, you know, if it's just one person, we're kind of taking this person at their word that they didn't do anything wrong.

612
00:46:57,538 --> 00:46:58,058
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for watching!

613
00:47:21,050 --> 00:47:37,713
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the other thoughts that kind of jumped in my mind, and I think this is worth considering, because I remember, and it's all documented on this show because this show is so fucking old, but back when my Xbox 360 was my primary system of choice, you may recall my Xbox Live account got hacked.

614
00:47:38,514 --> 00:47:51,518
[SPEAKER_01]: and somebody in another country used it to buy a bunch of those fucking FIFA packs and whatever FIFA release was out that year, FIFA 2008 or whatever this happened, like they bought a bunch of FIFA packs in one of those Xbox 360 games.

615
00:47:51,518 --> 00:48:02,361
[SPEAKER_01]: So my thought was, if this person was new to EA and just created an EA account, did their account actually get hacked and was used by somebody else to do something nefarious and they don't realize it?

616
00:48:02,361 --> 00:48:03,822
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why their account got banned.

617
00:48:05,343 --> 00:48:08,266
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's an option worth considering here.

618
00:48:08,266 --> 00:48:23,457
[SPEAKER_05]: Possibly, but considering based off of the description in the email, it sounds like they created the account, played the game, and then it got banned shortly after finishing the game or whatever, which wouldn't be a long period of time.

619
00:48:23,457 --> 00:48:25,859
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a short window for someone to hack their account.

620
00:48:27,290 --> 00:48:27,851
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

621
00:48:27,851 --> 00:48:30,012
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought maybe I thought they said it was a week later.

622
00:48:30,012 --> 00:48:30,293
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold on.

623
00:48:30,293 --> 00:48:30,693
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going.

624
00:48:30,693 --> 00:48:30,973
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going.

625
00:48:30,973 --> 00:48:34,136
[SPEAKER_01]: That's still a very short period of time.

626
00:48:34,136 --> 00:48:34,837
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it is.

627
00:48:34,837 --> 00:48:43,264
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, if they if they made an EA account and they were like, I'm just going to I'm not I'm just going to use a shitty password because I don't want an EA account, blah, blah, blah.

628
00:48:43,264 --> 00:48:49,910
[SPEAKER_01]: And they use like a password that already is on dark web from somewhere else that they didn't really care what password they were using.

629
00:48:49,910 --> 00:48:51,431
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe somebody was able to get it.

630
00:48:51,431 --> 00:48:52,212
[SPEAKER_01]: I just I just want to

631
00:48:52,692 --> 00:48:53,653
[SPEAKER_01]: Ehh, yeah, possibly

632
00:49:11,650 --> 00:49:15,293
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that would explain why EA thinks they're right in banning them.

633
00:49:15,293 --> 00:49:17,514
[SPEAKER_01]: And this guy doesn't understand what the hell happened.

634
00:49:17,514 --> 00:49:22,077
[SPEAKER_01]: I will say where EA sucks and where a lot of companies suck in this regard.

635
00:49:22,077 --> 00:49:23,839
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is what I will agree with.

636
00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:28,802
[SPEAKER_01]: And what does need to change is that they're not giving specific reasons as to why people got banned.

637
00:49:28,802 --> 00:49:29,202
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

638
00:49:29,202 --> 00:49:36,567
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't agree with our terms of sale or, or, and due to what terms of sale, you need to be more specific.

639
00:49:36,567 --> 00:49:37,348
[SPEAKER_01]: You need details.

640
00:49:38,629 --> 00:49:39,590
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's what's next!

641
00:49:55,948 --> 00:49:56,229
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura

642
00:50:12,182 --> 00:50:29,969
[SPEAKER_05]: Once again, you know, if the sir, if, if the experience that you get through piracy is better than the experience provided by doing the right thing and making the purchase through the, you know, the proper channels and paying for everything, then you're advocating piracy.

643
00:50:29,969 --> 00:50:32,550
[SPEAKER_05]: We love a theme.

644
00:50:32,550 --> 00:50:33,651
[SPEAKER_01]: We love a theme.

645
00:50:33,651 --> 00:50:38,973
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, DarkSakura, why don't you update us with a theme in another popular game?

646
00:50:41,895 --> 00:50:44,896
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, the game Fortnite.

647
00:50:44,896 --> 00:50:48,138
[SPEAKER_07]: It likes to do this kind of thing.

648
00:50:48,138 --> 00:50:54,000
[SPEAKER_07]: There is an event that happened in-game.

649
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,581
[SPEAKER_07]: It was called the Big Bang Event.

650
00:50:56,581 --> 00:51:01,043
[SPEAKER_07]: It lasted around 10 minutes and it put people all the way through different spots.

651
00:51:01,923 --> 00:51:17,368
[SPEAKER_07]: But it had everyone gathered on the OG Island to watch some different things in the past happen, like a rocket launch, a meteor crash, and everything going into a black hole.

652
00:51:17,368 --> 00:51:26,571
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you go through all these portals, and like Lego figures, and then all these other things happening, and then finally Eminem appears.

653
00:51:26,571 --> 00:51:30,973
[SPEAKER_07]: And he does Lose Yourself, and you had to hit the notes in time to the music,

654
00:51:31,929 --> 00:51:36,612
[SPEAKER_07]: very Guitar Hero-like.

655
00:51:36,612 --> 00:51:44,817
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, basically, he also turned into a kaiju and did Godzilla.

656
00:51:44,817 --> 00:51:49,320
[SPEAKER_07]: But it was like a big virtual performance.

657
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:55,924
[SPEAKER_07]: So he was the most recent to do an in-game performance in Fortnite.

658
00:51:57,048 --> 00:52:04,751
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, the end of season stuff's always amazing, which is funny because like I don't play the game, but like it sounds cool.

659
00:52:04,751 --> 00:52:12,354
[SPEAKER_05]: Like when you describe like all this pop culture stuff coming together, like they have The Rock playing one of the characters at one point.

660
00:52:12,354 --> 00:52:17,595
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's just it's nuts.

661
00:52:17,595 --> 00:52:20,557
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it sounds like it seems like Fortnite is trying to do a lot of weird stuff.

662
00:52:20,557 --> 00:52:20,657
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

663
00:52:25,341 --> 00:52:32,225
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of like when Fortnite does these things that aren't just about Battle Royale, you know, that does these.

664
00:52:32,225 --> 00:52:32,445
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

665
00:52:32,445 --> 00:52:36,847
[SPEAKER_01]: And SJ100 Matt points out, apparently The Weeknd is doing one next week.

666
00:52:36,847 --> 00:52:41,510
[SPEAKER_01]: It's only good if Daniel Craig is there to introduce him.

667
00:52:41,510 --> 00:52:46,914
[SPEAKER_01]: Ladies and gentlemen, The Weeknd.

668
00:52:46,914 --> 00:52:47,194
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway.

669
00:52:49,116 --> 00:52:57,979
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, TigerClaw points out they revealed some characters that will appear in Chapter 5 and T-SUM as well, and I've seen that discussion going on in our Discord server over at VOGNetwork.com slash Discord.

670
00:52:57,979 --> 00:52:58,839
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

671
00:52:58,839 --> 00:53:05,941
[SPEAKER_01]: So because I think I think there's like a Ninja Turtles character that TigerClaw is of course very excited about and you know some of that stuff.

672
00:53:05,941 --> 00:53:07,822
[SPEAKER_05]: There's like literally everything like it's

673
00:53:08,402 --> 00:53:09,402
[SPEAKER_01]: Family Guy, right?

674
00:53:09,402 --> 00:53:10,042
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

675
00:53:10,042 --> 00:53:15,324
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so funny because Fortnite is almost ending up being like the Oasis from Ready Player One.

676
00:53:15,324 --> 00:53:17,504
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like literally everything.

677
00:53:17,504 --> 00:53:18,245
[SPEAKER_01]: I never thought of it that way.

678
00:53:18,245 --> 00:53:18,925
[SPEAKER_01]: Altogether.

679
00:53:18,925 --> 00:53:20,425
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

680
00:53:20,425 --> 00:53:29,708
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of like kind of crazy that they get all these licensee, but it's a massive property that I have no interest in playing, but it looks fun.

681
00:53:29,708 --> 00:53:34,109
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I probably would have fun if I played it, but I'm not going to.

682
00:53:34,109 --> 00:53:34,909
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

683
00:53:36,730 --> 00:53:44,795
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, well, let's move on and talk about this story.

684
00:53:44,795 --> 00:53:50,038
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we talk about how like monetization is getting ridiculous with different things.

685
00:53:50,038 --> 00:53:57,742
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, now we're talking about Street Fighter 6 and the prices that Capcom are trying to charge for skins.

686
00:53:57,742 --> 00:54:01,385
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember back in the day when you could buy a skin pack and it was like,

687
00:54:02,861 --> 00:54:06,764
[SPEAKER_05]: $15 and that was expensive and you got like lots of skins.

688
00:54:06,764 --> 00:54:10,067
[SPEAKER_05]: Now they're trying to charge for outfit pack three.

689
00:54:10,067 --> 00:54:13,750
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess it's skins for each of the different characters.

690
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:19,073
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to cost you $100 in total if you were to purchase them.

691
00:54:19,073 --> 00:54:27,860
[SPEAKER_05]: It's 18 different skins and they, the way you have it, it says if you want all 18 outfits, you're going to have to spend over $60.

692
00:54:30,126 --> 00:54:38,473
[SPEAKER_05]: If you have 0 fighter coins, you have to buy 2 packs of $5 sets for 250 coins for a single outfit.

693
00:54:38,473 --> 00:54:57,209
[SPEAKER_05]: So basically, they do the whole HotDogHotDogBung thing with the monetization where you can buy packs of a certain amount of coins but everything costs just a little bit more than that so you have to buy multiple packs of that and you have some left over which is supposed to trigger your

694
00:54:58,030 --> 00:55:00,813
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, mine to go, oh, I got to spend this now.

695
00:55:00,813 --> 00:55:02,175
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just going to be sitting there rotting.

696
00:55:02,175 --> 00:55:04,897
[SPEAKER_05]: I've wasted my money, you know, and I have to go buy something else.

697
00:55:04,897 --> 00:55:06,319
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, that nonsense.

698
00:55:06,319 --> 00:55:09,903
[SPEAKER_05]: They try to manipulate people into purchasing things they don't want.

699
00:55:11,943 --> 00:55:13,544
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, they're expensive.

700
00:55:13,544 --> 00:55:15,525
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't buy them if you don't want them.

701
00:55:15,525 --> 00:55:17,447
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, same goes with like Overwatch 2.

702
00:55:17,447 --> 00:55:20,388
[SPEAKER_05]: We've talked about that where some skins are like 20 bucks.

703
00:55:20,388 --> 00:55:22,050
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like ridiculous.

704
00:55:22,050 --> 00:55:23,370
[SPEAKER_05]: And Destiny 2.

705
00:55:23,370 --> 00:55:27,113
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, they've had like different cosmetics.

706
00:55:27,113 --> 00:55:31,336
[SPEAKER_05]: I can never forget the Angry Joe show and Joe Vargas talking about

707
00:55:32,761 --> 00:55:36,985
[SPEAKER_05]: They're charging $20 for blue, or maybe that was Fallout 76.

708
00:55:36,985 --> 00:55:37,485
[SPEAKER_05]: One of them.

709
00:55:37,485 --> 00:55:38,146
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't matter.

710
00:55:38,146 --> 00:55:40,888
[SPEAKER_05]: You know why it's so easy to get confused of which game it was?

711
00:55:40,888 --> 00:55:42,349
[SPEAKER_05]: Because they all do it.

712
00:55:42,349 --> 00:55:45,052
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, it's just one of those things.

713
00:55:45,052 --> 00:55:48,755
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't support this type of behavior, and they'll stop doing this type of thing.

714
00:55:48,755 --> 00:55:51,778
[SPEAKER_05]: If no one buys it, then no one's... they're not gonna do it.

715
00:55:51,778 --> 00:55:54,240
[SPEAKER_05]: But the problem is, they don't need everyone to buy it.

716
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:56,882
[SPEAKER_05]: They just need their whales to buy it, and that's why they do it.

717
00:55:58,413 --> 00:55:59,334
[SPEAKER_05]: It's annoying.

718
00:55:59,334 --> 00:56:00,655
[SPEAKER_01]: Good point.

719
00:56:00,655 --> 00:56:05,499
[SPEAKER_01]: Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, remember back in the day when you just unlocked extra skins by playing the game a lot?

720
00:56:05,499 --> 00:56:06,559
[SPEAKER_01]: Seriously?

721
00:56:06,559 --> 00:56:11,003
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and palette swaps were just hitting a different button to select your character.

722
00:56:11,003 --> 00:56:14,826
[SPEAKER_05]: Or it could be even a different skin.

723
00:56:14,826 --> 00:56:18,168
[SPEAKER_05]: You could just switch between the skins and stuff.

724
00:56:18,168 --> 00:56:22,171
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so dumb that they figured out that they can monetize everything and so they do.

725
00:56:23,112 --> 00:56:30,578
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it started way back in the day with EA charging for cheat codes on the Xbox 360 that you could get for free on the PlayStation 2.

726
00:56:30,578 --> 00:56:33,981
[SPEAKER_05]: The beginning of the end.

727
00:56:33,981 --> 00:56:43,509
[SPEAKER_05]: They're testing the waters with stuff and seeing what they can get away with and then pushing the envelope even more until people, you know, complain about it and there's a big backlash.

728
00:56:43,729 --> 00:56:46,912
[SPEAKER_05]: and they bring it back and they slowly inch towards that again.

729
00:56:46,912 --> 00:57:00,463
[SPEAKER_05]: Or, there's the option, I forget what the actual phrase for this is, but basically where they propose something absolutely ridiculously evil and then walk it back to something less evil, but that's really what they wanted in the first place.

730
00:57:00,463 --> 00:57:05,367
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, instead of saying, I'm gonna kill all the puppies, I'm just gonna kill one of the puppies.

731
00:57:05,367 --> 00:57:07,269
[SPEAKER_05]: And you're like, well, I guess that's... I don't like that analogy.

732
00:57:07,269 --> 00:57:09,811
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not as bad as killing all the puppies, but, you know.

733
00:57:10,796 --> 00:57:11,521
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the trolley problem.

734
00:57:11,521 --> 00:57:12,912
[SPEAKER_05]: I only wanted to kill one poppy.

735
00:57:12,912 --> 00:57:13,738
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the trolley problem.

736
00:57:15,538 --> 00:57:20,281
[SPEAKER_01]: TigerClawChat says, speaking of Fallout, have you seen the trailer for the live action series?

737
00:57:20,281 --> 00:57:21,381
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, no, I haven't.

738
00:57:21,381 --> 00:57:22,262
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm excited.

739
00:57:22,262 --> 00:57:22,722
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks awesome.

740
00:57:22,722 --> 00:57:23,983
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard it looks pretty good.

741
00:57:23,983 --> 00:57:24,343
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to.

742
00:57:24,343 --> 00:57:25,964
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not super into Fallout.

743
00:57:25,964 --> 00:57:26,585
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.

744
00:57:26,585 --> 00:57:27,545
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I'm not.

745
00:57:27,545 --> 00:57:32,088
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not like the other gamers, but if it was if it was Elder Scrolls.

746
00:57:32,088 --> 00:57:33,549
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just the world.

747
00:57:33,549 --> 00:57:34,450
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd check it out.

748
00:57:34,450 --> 00:57:35,010
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

749
00:57:35,010 --> 00:57:37,652
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, maybe and maybe it'll land better for me as a TV show.

750
00:57:37,652 --> 00:57:38,512
[SPEAKER_01]: I should check it out.

751
00:57:38,512 --> 00:57:39,373
[SPEAKER_01]: I really should.

752
00:57:39,373 --> 00:57:42,015
[SPEAKER_05]: So just watch the trailer and see if it hits some of the.

753
00:57:44,045 --> 00:57:46,489
[SPEAKER_01]: E3VL says surprised it's on Amazon Prime Video instead of Paramount like Halo

754
00:57:58,188 --> 00:58:09,231
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, they bought the rights to it a long time ago, so it's not... And I mean, was it the... We're still waiting for... Remember, there's the Bioshock show that's gonna be coming to Netflix, I think.

755
00:58:09,231 --> 00:58:17,314
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a Final Fantasy XIV show that was supposed to happen at some point, too, and you know I'm excited about that, but it seems to be... It's... It's... Gamer's eating good.

756
00:58:17,314 --> 00:58:17,814
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

757
00:58:17,814 --> 00:58:17,994
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

758
00:58:19,825 --> 00:58:33,654
[SPEAKER_01]: Moving on, let's talk about the game Atari 50, which was a pretty cool little retro collection that was released earlier this year, I think it was this year, by Digital Eclipse, who Atari actually happens to now own.

759
00:58:33,654 --> 00:58:41,640
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know if it's as a result of that or what, but as part of this, Atari 50 is getting more games with a free update.

760
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:50,505
[SPEAKER_01]: Essentially, it's DLC, but not in the traditional sense of like paying for it because it's actually just a patch that's it's gonna but it's gonna feel like DLC, I guess.

761
00:58:50,505 --> 00:58:56,148
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe a good counterpoint to what Loki was just talking about.

762
00:58:56,148 --> 00:59:06,373
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's here's a nice way where the digital stuff has actually enhanced a game because Atari 50 is getting an update with 12 new games in it that's coming out next week for the price of free.

763
00:59:06,733 --> 00:59:07,133
[SPEAKER_01]: December 5th, 2023

764
00:59:29,361 --> 00:59:38,349
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking of the whole Atari and Digital Eclipse thing, it should also be pointed out, reminded, that this week we also find out what Digital Eclipse is doing for their next Gold Master series.

765
00:59:38,349 --> 00:59:48,839
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, I think a lot of people slept on the making of Karateka, which is really the same engine as Atari 50, but when they focus solely on one game, they really go in-depth with this.

766
00:59:48,839 --> 00:59:52,703
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're going to be doing it for another game, so we're going to find out what that game is this week.

767
00:59:52,703 --> 00:59:54,785
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, some people kind of go with the

768
00:59:55,325 --> 01:00:01,528
[SPEAKER_01]: obvious choice of Prince of Persia which would be Jordan Mechner's kind of next big game would be a good one for that.

769
01:00:01,528 --> 01:00:23,117
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been a little bit, I suggested Wolfenstein 3D as the game and the reason why is because for some reason one of the people that worked with that game was interviewed in the material for the Karateka, making of Karateka and I was like that, I mean the guy from Mortal Kombat I can see that one a little bit and I don't see Warner Brothers playing nice with anyone at all at this point but

770
01:00:24,378 --> 01:00:26,665
[SPEAKER_01]: Why is the guy from Wolfenstein 3D in there?

771
01:00:26,665 --> 01:00:29,754
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe they had him comment on it while they were interviewing him for something else.

772
01:00:30,652 --> 01:00:42,355
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's, and I think that would be a very interesting, you know, because that particular game was the start of like a 3D revolution of sorts on PC and shareware.

773
01:00:42,355 --> 01:00:47,997
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's so much they could do with that game and talking about the impact of shareware in that era.

774
01:00:47,997 --> 01:00:55,939
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think there's a lot of younger gamers today, God, I sound like an old man, but it's true, that don't like know what shareware was all about.

775
01:00:56,619 --> 01:01:20,394
[SPEAKER_01]: when there was amazing so much of us like live that like we played the shit out of Commander Keen gotcha mon fake mods yeah you know yeah exactly so i i think that would be such an interesting title um and all the mods people did for that and of course you got things like spear of destiny that came out after that i think that would be such an interesting title but we'll see we'll see i realize i'm reaching so we'll see we'll see what happens with that uh later up this week

776
01:01:20,934 --> 01:01:24,737
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, I'm getting whatever they make.

777
01:01:24,737 --> 01:01:25,757
[SPEAKER_01]: They won me over.

778
01:01:25,757 --> 01:01:27,458
[SPEAKER_01]: And honestly, same.

779
01:01:27,458 --> 01:01:42,068
[SPEAKER_01]: I I wasn't even a big fan of Karate Cup, but I thought that the the museum that they put together was so good in that that honestly, if whatever they do is as good preserved as that, it's it's going to be great.

780
01:01:42,068 --> 01:01:44,050
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah.

781
01:01:44,050 --> 01:01:45,250
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

782
01:01:45,250 --> 01:01:50,534
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's move on to other moments in gaming history, perhaps DarkSakura.

783
01:01:52,416 --> 01:02:02,366
[SPEAKER_07]: So, there's times when people own their own business that someone might shutter the business, but, you know, keep paying the rent for the storage.

784
01:02:04,004 --> 01:02:10,308
[SPEAKER_07]: We know that there were mom and pop video rental stores.

785
01:02:10,308 --> 01:02:22,194
[SPEAKER_07]: There was a store in Nebraska that was a video game store that closed in 1998 and the inventory was put into storage.

786
01:02:23,055 --> 01:02:36,709
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, what they found after opening it last year is 173 items in there that they've had appraised, plus others that haven't been looked at yet.

787
01:02:36,709 --> 01:02:43,517
[SPEAKER_07]: So, like, I'm looking at an entire box on one of these of Blackthorn, which honestly, no great loss.

788
01:02:43,997 --> 01:02:47,039
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, there's other games in there.

789
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:50,522
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, we thought it would just come back and sell them at some point.

790
01:02:50,522 --> 01:02:53,384
[SPEAKER_07]: And they are now pretty vintage.

791
01:02:53,384 --> 01:02:55,746
[SPEAKER_07]: So.

792
01:02:55,746 --> 01:02:59,168
[SPEAKER_07]: The.

793
01:02:59,168 --> 01:03:11,917
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, some of this is, I think, someone who doesn't actually really know the value of some of the games, because like it's like had a sealed copy of Chrono Trigger and like some people will pay ten thousand dollars.

794
01:03:11,917 --> 01:03:12,277
[SPEAKER_07]: No, they won't.

795
01:03:15,021 --> 01:03:20,484
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, some people might, but I don't think Chrono Trigger would fetch that, you know.

796
01:03:20,484 --> 01:03:27,888
[SPEAKER_07]: But he's thinking that selling off the whole collection would bring him in, you know, six figures.

797
01:03:27,888 --> 01:03:30,590
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think so.

798
01:03:30,590 --> 01:03:40,515
[SPEAKER_07]: But he's going to be... They've called the collection now the Nebraska Collection, and the games in there will not be sold individually.

799
01:03:40,515 --> 01:03:42,717
[SPEAKER_07]: He's going to try to sell them all.

800
01:03:44,014 --> 01:03:59,367
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, all at once, which again, I don't think, I mean, if someone does it, they've got more money than sense, but I'm trying to see if, if it was posted anywhere, like what the actual list of, of the games.

801
01:03:59,367 --> 01:04:04,231
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't, I don't see the list.

802
01:04:04,231 --> 01:04:07,894
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, if you think about it with it being a store from 1998,

803
01:04:11,579 --> 01:04:17,224
[SPEAKER_07]: then think about what would have been out at that time as a new game.

804
01:04:17,224 --> 01:04:25,032
[SPEAKER_07]: Or even just in the past, I would say, 8 months before that if they were keeping their stock up to date.

805
01:04:28,181 --> 01:04:35,048
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, the the annoying thing is that I'm trying to see if there is a list of what's actually in the collection.

806
01:04:35,048 --> 01:04:36,790
[SPEAKER_01]: Right around that year, it wasn't linked.

807
01:04:36,790 --> 01:04:43,856
[SPEAKER_01]: You should have Black Lion Final Fantasy 7 and was Castlevania Symphony of the Night 98 or 99?

808
01:04:43,856 --> 01:04:47,140
[SPEAKER_01]: But you might have some some Black Lion PlayStation games around that time, too.

809
01:04:47,140 --> 01:04:48,141
[SPEAKER_01]: That was after.

810
01:04:48,141 --> 01:04:50,703
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of those that came out like the year I moved out.

811
01:04:50,703 --> 01:04:51,124
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think 99.

812
01:04:51,124 --> 01:04:51,264
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, OK.

813
01:04:53,925 --> 01:04:57,168
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, because Dan had the import copy when I moved out here.

814
01:04:57,168 --> 01:04:59,769
[SPEAKER_07]: Mm hmm.

815
01:04:59,769 --> 01:05:11,138
[SPEAKER_01]: Even still, some of those old, but I mean, still some of those old school PlayStation package games like back before they they had the big like rectangular cases, some of those still fetch a bit of money just because those cases are so rare.

816
01:05:11,138 --> 01:05:13,100
[SPEAKER_01]: So, oh, SJ100mat links a video.

817
01:05:13,100 --> 01:05:15,421
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, and thank you for the YouTube link.

818
01:05:15,421 --> 01:05:19,304
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm looking, trying to find something text based because, you know, live show.

819
01:05:19,304 --> 01:05:21,626
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

820
01:05:21,626 --> 01:05:21,946
[SPEAKER_07]: But

821
01:05:23,982 --> 01:05:26,524
[SPEAKER_07]: And now like everything's completely locked up on me.

822
01:05:26,524 --> 01:05:27,485
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.

823
01:05:27,485 --> 01:05:32,809
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but yeah, I think it's gonna be interesting that this guy probably does make a little bit of money off of this.

824
01:05:32,809 --> 01:05:34,190
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably not as much as he thinks.

825
01:05:34,190 --> 01:05:48,460
[SPEAKER_01]: I think all of that, you know, that Super Mario Brothers original cart auction fuckery that happened, which I believe was shown to be that it was a whole scheme to inflate the value of that type of stuff in the first place, may have given this guy a bad perception.

826
01:05:48,460 --> 01:05:48,741
[SPEAKER_01]: But like,

827
01:05:49,381 --> 01:05:54,645
[SPEAKER_01]: If he does have a sealed copy of Stadium Events, I mean, yeah, he's going to get money for that.

828
01:05:54,645 --> 01:05:57,007
[SPEAKER_01]: And even, you know, he probably could.

829
01:05:57,007 --> 01:05:59,069
[SPEAKER_07]: This is so stupid.

830
01:05:59,069 --> 01:06:01,891
[SPEAKER_01]: A sealed chrono trigger is still going to be worth a bit.

831
01:06:01,891 --> 01:06:03,833
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know about $10,000, but it'll be worth a bit of money.

832
01:06:03,833 --> 01:06:15,582
[SPEAKER_07]: No, looking at the page for the Nebraska collection and each of them had a placeholder amount of a million dollars on them.

833
01:06:16,678 --> 01:06:18,179
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, really?

834
01:06:18,179 --> 01:06:29,623
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm looking at the games, we have ActRaiser 2, which would get money, Arrow the Acrobat, there's an Afterburner 32X, Alien 3, eh.

835
01:06:29,623 --> 01:06:31,944
[SPEAKER_07]: Alien vs. Predator, eh.

836
01:06:31,944 --> 01:06:36,346
[SPEAKER_07]: There's Arcana, I'm looking for things that I think would actually have been like

837
01:06:37,086 --> 01:06:53,503
[SPEAKER_07]: Worth Something, Sealed Battletoads for Genesis, Breath of Fire 2 with the crappy American artwork, the Dracula game was terrible.

838
01:06:53,503 --> 01:06:55,546
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, there's a few things on here.

839
01:06:55,546 --> 01:06:57,848
[SPEAKER_07]: Brain Lord, actually.

840
01:06:57,848 --> 01:06:58,589
[SPEAKER_07]: That one's kind of...

841
01:07:02,119 --> 01:07:05,103
[SPEAKER_07]: But so far, I mean, there's a chrono trigger.

842
01:07:05,103 --> 01:07:08,648
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that would get money.

843
01:07:08,648 --> 01:07:13,534
[SPEAKER_07]: And honestly, the games that are on here that I would want, I have.

844
01:07:17,728 --> 01:07:23,231
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just looking through, and a lot of them I have sealed as well.

845
01:07:23,231 --> 01:07:29,293
[SPEAKER_07]: But the thing is that they've got these placeholders on them so that they can show what the games are.

846
01:07:29,293 --> 01:07:31,174
[SPEAKER_07]: They're going to be sold en masse.

847
01:07:31,174 --> 01:07:35,696
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's an Eternal Champions, there's a Final Fantasy III.

848
01:07:35,696 --> 01:07:37,576
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, I'm looking for notable, you know.

849
01:07:40,345 --> 01:07:43,570
[SPEAKER_07]: WowLotus2's Sega Collection.

850
01:07:43,570 --> 01:07:44,512
[SPEAKER_07]: Bunch of Madden!

851
01:07:45,495 --> 01:07:46,255
[SPEAKER_07]: Whoop-de-shit!

852
01:08:13,103 --> 01:08:16,204
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, let's move on, Loki!

853
01:08:17,699 --> 01:08:22,783
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, so this is quite the blunder, and I think it's pretty funny.

854
01:08:22,783 --> 01:08:40,237
[SPEAKER_05]: So Ubisoft has been in a panic because they accidentally uploaded Beyond Good and Evil Remaster, a game that has not been announced, to their Ubisoft Plus subscribers.

855
01:08:40,237 --> 01:08:44,681
[SPEAKER_05]: And folks were able to download it and play the game, but now they're trying to walk back

856
01:08:45,640 --> 01:08:51,321
[SPEAKER_05]: The leak saying, oh, hold on, you know, but then eventually they came out and said, OK, fine.

857
01:08:51,321 --> 01:08:54,082
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess Cat's out of bag.

858
01:08:54,082 --> 01:08:56,743
[SPEAKER_05]: Beyond Good and Evil is coming out.

859
01:08:56,743 --> 01:09:00,944
[SPEAKER_05]: The remaster for the 20th anniversary next year.

860
01:09:00,944 --> 01:09:07,485
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think I think it's hilarious when they tried to, you know.

861
01:09:07,485 --> 01:09:11,006
[SPEAKER_05]: Delist it really quickly in a panic, but yeah, it's all messed up.

862
01:09:13,257 --> 01:09:20,012
[SPEAKER_05]: It's gonna have a 4K visuals and 60fps gameplay with improved graphics controls and audio.

863
01:09:20,012 --> 01:09:22,497
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, typically what you expect with a remaster.

864
01:09:23,817 --> 01:09:30,582
[SPEAKER_01]: This is kind of a weird thing to be hiding in December, but then I'm kind of like, oh, maybe this was something for the Game Awards.

865
01:09:30,582 --> 01:09:32,583
[SPEAKER_01]: It was probably the Game Awards announcement.

866
01:09:32,583 --> 01:09:34,304
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably something they were going to unveil.

867
01:09:34,304 --> 01:09:34,845
[SPEAKER_01]: Whoops.

868
01:09:34,845 --> 01:09:36,466
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

869
01:09:36,466 --> 01:09:36,946
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

870
01:09:36,946 --> 01:09:37,446
[SPEAKER_01]: Whoops.

871
01:09:37,446 --> 01:09:40,268
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and to be fair, we'll probably still see it there.

872
01:09:40,268 --> 01:09:40,709
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't see it.

873
01:09:40,709 --> 01:09:44,051
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to like pull the trigger because the thing that didn't leak is the footage.

874
01:09:44,051 --> 01:09:48,034
[SPEAKER_01]: So they'll still want to show that 4K 60 frames a second and all that stuff, the footage.

875
01:09:48,034 --> 01:09:52,737
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think for the most part, it's just to remind people that Beyond Good and Evil is in fact a franchise.

876
01:09:53,417 --> 01:10:12,851
[SPEAKER_01]: uh even though we haven't seen anything new from it for um god a decade uh even though we were promised something but we know how that you know how that goes you know how good developments and the game yeah and the one that was a leaked out wasn't the the final game either it was a development version that was leaked out so whoops whoops

877
01:10:15,985 --> 01:10:16,905
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we'll see.

878
01:10:16,905 --> 01:10:22,167
[SPEAKER_01]: This could be one of those safe bets for things you're going to see at the Game Awards.

879
01:10:22,167 --> 01:10:29,610
[SPEAKER_01]: Lastly, but not leastly, as we're going into the Game Awards this week, you know, there's been a lot of talk about what a great year it's been for video games.

880
01:10:29,610 --> 01:10:39,154
[SPEAKER_01]: But I have to say, actually, if you haven't seen the video with Ben Starr that's floating around on social media right now, he did a really good job kind of summarizing how

881
01:10:39,654 --> 01:10:44,780
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great year for video games, but it's not a great year for the industry.

882
01:10:44,780 --> 01:10:52,728
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, as we've also kind of been talking about is that there's been a lot of layoffs and stuff.

883
01:10:52,728 --> 01:10:53,709
[SPEAKER_01]: And this week is no different.

884
01:10:53,709 --> 01:10:56,752
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually am stalling because I actually wanted to play this for you.

885
01:10:56,752 --> 01:10:59,395
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you did such a good job putting this together.

886
01:10:59,395 --> 01:11:00,456
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me actually

887
01:11:01,297 --> 01:11:02,680
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you say 2023 is the best year for video games?

888
01:11:10,942 --> 01:11:12,643
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, are we going to get serious?

889
01:11:12,643 --> 01:11:16,966
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, yes, it is an amazing year for video games to come out.

890
01:11:16,966 --> 01:11:21,029
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's not a great year for video games insofar as all of the layoffs.

891
01:11:21,029 --> 01:11:25,813
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's not great for that and I think that does need to be spoken about at an event like this.

892
01:11:25,813 --> 01:11:32,758
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we want to celebrate all of these games but maybe there is something missing because a lot of people who made those games are no longer working at those companies.

893
01:11:33,058 --> 01:11:35,059
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that also has to be respected.

894
01:11:35,059 --> 01:11:42,022
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, 2023 is an astonishing year for the video games that have been made, but not necessarily for the industry that it reflects.

895
01:11:42,022 --> 01:11:44,062
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think that's a shame.

896
01:11:44,062 --> 01:11:46,443
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully, this is the worst that it gets.

897
01:11:46,443 --> 01:11:48,404
[SPEAKER_00]: I fear that it isn't.

898
01:11:48,404 --> 01:12:00,469
[SPEAKER_00]: But I really hope that, you know, we, the industry figures out a way of course correcting and allowing those people who've made these games that we are celebrating today, to celebrate them as well and not be on, you know, the unemployment line.

899
01:12:01,429 --> 01:12:20,339
[SPEAKER_01]: I think he did such a good job putting that out there and really being respectful of the award ceremony that he was attending but you know saying that we're here to celebrate this today but we need to find a way to kind of stop laying people off with all this thing so sorry I know that was a bit long of a clip but I had to play that and

900
01:12:20,999 --> 01:12:31,288
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that orange suit that he's wearing, but he does wear it a little high-waisted like he's going to go play golf after, but I still am very jealous of that orange velvet that he's wearing in that scene.

901
01:12:31,288 --> 01:12:38,313
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, unfortunately, that all leads into me talking about, unfortunately, another layoff story.

902
01:12:38,313 --> 01:12:44,058
[SPEAKER_01]: This one's from Unity, and so you kind of go, well, Unity didn't have the greatest year.

903
01:12:45,459 --> 01:12:49,040
[SPEAKER_01]: At least the CEO took a hit.

904
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:52,560
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually with these stories, somehow the CEO is never held accountable.

905
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:55,801
[SPEAKER_01]: In this particular case, Unity's CEO was held accountable.

906
01:12:55,801 --> 01:13:09,844
[SPEAKER_01]: But Unity will be laying off 265 employees, specifically though at Weta Digital, which was part of the acquisition of the VFX business, because Unity is now going to step away from this to focus on their core business,

907
01:13:10,464 --> 01:13:13,546
[SPEAKER_01]: I wonder why their core business needs to be focused on.

908
01:13:13,546 --> 01:13:18,229
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think some of this does play into what has happened as you saw earlier.

909
01:13:18,229 --> 01:13:22,572
[SPEAKER_01]: This would be 3.8% of the total workforce for Unity.

910
01:13:22,572 --> 01:13:26,314
[SPEAKER_01]: This was Peter Jackson's original company there.

911
01:13:26,314 --> 01:13:30,937
[SPEAKER_01]: The pipeline technology and engineering talent, the deal was worth $1.652 billion when it happened.

912
01:13:39,062 --> 01:13:46,547
[SPEAKER_01]: Unity believes the Weta Digital team are remarkable, but Unity needs to become leaner as it focuses its expertise on its core business.

913
01:13:46,547 --> 01:13:52,450
[SPEAKER_01]: It also believes it will make more sense for WetaFX to own full end-to-end production activities directly.

914
01:13:52,450 --> 01:14:03,337
[SPEAKER_01]: Unity will be focusing its expertise and people on other matters, and WetaFX will be getting support for its use of the Weta tools directly from its own crew, a shorter path which makes sense for both companies.

915
01:14:03,777 --> 01:14:25,597
[SPEAKER_01]: so um that's a bunch of bunch of speak there i i don't know like then why did you buy it in the first place like like that was kind of a tacky decision to just do i hate it when companies buy other companies and lay everybody off well because i think that they're they were hoping that their their engine was going to be more so

916
01:14:27,151 --> 01:14:32,915
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what we saw with the Matrix, that whole Matrix simulation thing we had in the Unity 5 demo.

917
01:14:32,915 --> 01:14:34,576
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, sort of.

918
01:14:34,576 --> 01:14:35,317
[SPEAKER_01]: That was Unreal.

919
01:14:35,317 --> 01:14:37,358
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I get them all mixed up, sorry.

920
01:14:37,358 --> 01:14:38,899
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no, that's fair enough.

921
01:14:38,899 --> 01:14:48,065
[SPEAKER_05]: And actually, to that point, like, so Unreal 5, for example, has actually been used in TV shows to generate, it could be sets or whatever.

922
01:14:48,065 --> 01:14:56,811
[SPEAKER_05]: Like one modern example of that actually is, so Linus Sebastian of Linus Tech Tips has a channel called

923
01:14:59,373 --> 01:15:02,116
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it's a game quickie or something like that.

924
01:15:02,116 --> 01:15:07,782
[SPEAKER_05]: And the set that they use in that is actually a virtual set that they created in Unreal 5.

925
01:15:07,782 --> 01:15:14,489
[SPEAKER_05]: And so there's actually other productions that are using that as like a way to, you know, produce video.

926
01:15:14,489 --> 01:15:17,612
[SPEAKER_05]: Like they can do movies and animation, all sorts of stuff in that.

927
01:15:18,232 --> 01:15:21,013
[SPEAKER_05]: Unity was setting themselves up to be kind of like that.

928
01:15:21,013 --> 01:15:28,515
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, there were many tech demos or movies that they would be putting out to try to push it in that direction.

929
01:15:28,515 --> 01:15:34,836
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if they ever got to that point and if people were really using the software like that.

930
01:15:34,836 --> 01:15:36,437
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's just...

931
01:15:38,460 --> 01:15:42,425
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess that what didn't work out as well for them as they had hoped.

932
01:15:42,425 --> 01:15:51,195
[SPEAKER_05]: Which makes sense because, I mean, like, one of the things that Unity tries to push to with their software is the utilization of, like, monetization and ads and stuff like that.

933
01:15:51,195 --> 01:15:53,999
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't really do that with movie production.

934
01:15:53,999 --> 01:15:54,980
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I don't know.

935
01:15:57,268 --> 01:15:58,128
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

936
01:15:58,128 --> 01:16:08,273
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let's let's let's travel back to a simpler time when games were just games, even though we may have a little bit of a twist tonight, but I'm going to run the bumper all the same.

937
01:16:18,945 --> 01:16:26,708
[SPEAKER_06]: And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time, where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

938
01:16:26,708 --> 01:16:30,049
[SPEAKER_06]: It's time for the classic game of the week.

939
01:16:30,049 --> 01:16:38,072
[SPEAKER_01]: But in our twist for this year, once a month, DarkSakura picks a non-video game to spotlight in this segment.

940
01:16:38,072 --> 01:16:42,754
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, what did you pick tonight for the classic non-video game?

941
01:16:42,754 --> 01:16:44,394
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually picked this for you, Rob.

942
01:16:44,394 --> 01:16:45,375
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought it might be.

943
01:16:47,125 --> 01:16:54,551
[SPEAKER_07]: I picked Cluedo, as it is known everywhere else in the world except North America, where here it is called Clue.

944
01:16:54,551 --> 01:17:09,123
[SPEAKER_07]: It is a murder mystery game for three to six players, and it was created, or I'd say conceptualized, in 1943 by a British board game designer called Anthony E. Pratt.

945
01:17:09,944 --> 01:17:24,369
[SPEAKER_07]: It was first manufactured by Waddingtons in the UK in 1949, and since then it's been relaunched, it has been updated, modernized, and is now owned by Hasbro here in the US.

946
01:17:24,369 --> 01:17:29,911
[SPEAKER_07]: So basically, the purpose of the game is to figure out who the victim is,

947
01:17:30,871 --> 01:17:34,513
[SPEAKER_07]: where the crime took place and which weapon was used.

948
01:17:34,513 --> 01:17:46,601
[SPEAKER_07]: And so you assume the role of one of the suspects and try to figure out how by moving around the game board and, you know, collecting the clues to see who it was.

949
01:17:46,601 --> 01:17:50,243
[SPEAKER_07]: And oh, has this game explodedodeded.

950
01:17:52,004 --> 01:17:56,247
[SPEAKER_07]: It's had spinoffs, movies, games.

951
01:17:56,247 --> 01:18:02,651
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I'm going to go a little bit into some of the history of this game.

952
01:18:02,651 --> 01:18:15,660
[SPEAKER_07]: So basically, Pratt, who was a musician and a factory worker, was stuck in home during the air raids in Birmingham, England, during World War II.

953
01:18:17,001 --> 01:18:26,127
[SPEAKER_07]: And he was thinking about these murder mystery games that some of his clients would have.

954
01:18:26,127 --> 01:18:33,732
[SPEAKER_07]: And how exactly how popular detective fiction was, including Agatha Christie.

955
01:18:33,732 --> 01:18:42,859
[SPEAKER_07]: So he put out a patent in 1944 for his invention of a murder mystery game originally called Murder with an exclamation point.

956
01:18:42,859 --> 01:18:44,220
[SPEAKER_07]: Would you have played a game called Murder?

957
01:18:45,679 --> 01:18:49,940
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I mean, there was a game called 13 Dead End Drive, and I did play that.

958
01:18:49,940 --> 01:18:55,821
[SPEAKER_01]: So sure, sure, I'd play a game called Murder, as long as it wasn't like Murder Me.

959
01:18:55,821 --> 01:19:14,645
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, at any rate, Pratt and his wife, Elva, who she had helped design the game, brought it to the executive at Waddington's, Norman Watson, who bought it on site and provided the name Cluedo.

960
01:19:16,013 --> 01:19:24,135
[SPEAKER_07]: which is a variation, of course, on the word clue and Ludo, which is the Latin word for I play.

961
01:19:24,135 --> 01:19:31,456
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was also the name of a game that was based off of Pachizi.

962
01:19:31,456 --> 01:19:40,458
[SPEAKER_07]: At any rate, the design of the house was said to be based on the Tudor Clothes Hotel in Roddingdeen.

963
01:19:41,758 --> 01:19:43,639
[SPEAKER_07]: Murder at Tudor Close

964
01:19:57,126 --> 01:20:05,850
[SPEAKER_07]: shortages of materials that prevented the official launch until 1949 where it was licensed to Parker Brothers in the U.S.

965
01:20:05,850 --> 01:20:09,511
[SPEAKER_07]: and was renamed Clue because people in the U.S.

966
01:20:09,511 --> 01:20:10,952
[SPEAKER_07]: didn't know what Ludo was.

967
01:20:10,952 --> 01:20:18,455
[SPEAKER_07]: And we wouldn't know the name Ludo until the NeverEnding Story and then a band named themselves after the character.

968
01:20:18,455 --> 01:20:18,695
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway.

969
01:20:20,556 --> 01:20:26,778
[SPEAKER_07]: So, some of the differences from the original concept and the one published in 1949.

970
01:20:26,778 --> 01:20:34,502
[SPEAKER_07]: Pratt's design called for ten characters, with one designated to be the victim by random drawing.

971
01:20:34,502 --> 01:20:38,624
[SPEAKER_07]: The characters eliminated were Mr. Brown, Mr. Gold, Ms.

972
01:20:38,624 --> 01:20:40,805
[SPEAKER_07]: Gray, and Mrs. Silver.

973
01:20:40,805 --> 01:20:46,748
[SPEAKER_07]: There was the character of Nurse White and Colonel Yellow were renamed to Mrs. White and Colonel Mustard.

974
01:20:48,909 --> 01:20:56,614
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you could play up to the eight remaining characters, add up to nine suspects.

975
01:20:56,614 --> 01:21:01,557
[SPEAKER_07]: Originally there were 11 rooms, including a room called the Gun Room and the Cellar.

976
01:21:01,557 --> 01:21:04,539
[SPEAKER_07]: And there were originally nine weapons.

977
01:21:04,539 --> 01:21:11,143
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of the ones not used were a bomb, a syringe, a shillelagh.

978
01:21:11,143 --> 01:21:12,224
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what a shillelagh is, right?

979
01:21:13,044 --> 01:21:15,447
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, a bomb?

980
01:21:15,447 --> 01:21:16,067
[SPEAKER_01]: A bomb.

981
01:21:16,067 --> 01:21:18,750
[SPEAKER_01]: Wouldn't that kind of also blow up the house?

982
01:21:18,750 --> 01:21:20,872
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad they cut that one.

983
01:21:20,872 --> 01:21:25,257
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and it could be like a localized, like a little pipe bomb or something.

984
01:21:25,257 --> 01:21:29,581
[SPEAKER_07]: But the Shillelagh is what the Blight carries, his cudgel walking stick.

985
01:21:31,656 --> 01:21:36,338
[SPEAKER_07]: There was a fireplace poker and later on an axe and poison.

986
01:21:36,338 --> 01:21:41,060
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of these did appear in spin-off versions of the game.

987
01:21:41,060 --> 01:21:50,884
[SPEAKER_07]: The gameplay was a little bit different too, so the remaining playing cards were distributed into the rooms to be retrieved rather than dealt to players.

988
01:21:51,704 --> 01:21:59,216
[SPEAKER_07]: and that you had to land on another player in order to make a suggestion about their character with the use of tokens.

989
01:21:59,216 --> 01:22:02,121
[SPEAKER_07]: And once you're out of tokens, you could no longer make the suggestions.

990
01:22:05,142 --> 01:22:13,067
[SPEAKER_07]: Some were left unchanged for the standard classic detective editions, and some were changed later.

991
01:22:13,067 --> 01:22:22,913
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of the methodology for the game was similar to an American card game called The King of Hearts Has Five Sons, which is a game I'm not familiar with.

992
01:22:23,833 --> 01:22:33,521
[SPEAKER_07]: But it was really a game that would get people together and have a little mystery on a cold night.

993
01:22:33,521 --> 01:22:40,807
[SPEAKER_07]: As far as its marketing, it was called the Great New Detective Game and it's launched in North America.

994
01:22:44,278 --> 01:22:56,447
[SPEAKER_07]: They also were trying to get the license for the great new Sherlock Holmes game from the Doyle estate, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.

995
01:22:56,447 --> 01:23:01,792
[SPEAKER_07]: And so it was really marketed as the great detective game and the Parker Brothers detective game.

996
01:23:03,213 --> 01:23:08,998
[SPEAKER_07]: The launch of the 1972 edition, which for those who are watching live is what we are seeing.

997
01:23:08,998 --> 01:23:15,504
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is honestly the version I grew up playing because all my friends had the old copy of the game.

998
01:23:15,504 --> 01:23:15,904
[SPEAKER_01]: Same.

999
01:23:15,904 --> 01:23:20,528
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, we actually had this version at home until I got Master Detective, although I'm sure that's coming up later.

1000
01:23:20,528 --> 01:23:23,611
[SPEAKER_01]: But yes, I also had this version.

1001
01:23:23,611 --> 01:23:23,731
[SPEAKER_07]: Mm hmm.

1002
01:23:25,109 --> 01:23:36,856
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, basically the commercials in 72, which I've seen these commercials had Holmes and Watson playing a competitive game of Clue.

1003
01:23:36,856 --> 01:23:51,886
[SPEAKER_07]: And then later on, like they started having like a guy who was like Inspector Clouseau from the Pink Panther films, you know, and then they now like as of 1986, the slogan went to classic detective game that's persisted all the way up until 2003.

1004
01:23:55,738 --> 01:23:56,410
[SPEAKER_07]: But, um...

1005
01:23:57,958 --> 01:24:06,662
[SPEAKER_07]: They've had like very famous, you know, fictional detectives feature in some of the marketing, including Sam Spade.

1006
01:24:06,662 --> 01:24:19,708
[SPEAKER_07]: So, so in general for the game, your equipment is you have a game board that has your rooms and secret passages in an English country house called Tudor Mansion.

1007
01:24:19,708 --> 01:24:27,351
[SPEAKER_07]: It's had other names like Tudor Close, Tudor Hall, Arlington Grange, Body Manor or Body Mansion.

1008
01:24:29,032 --> 01:24:50,811
[SPEAKER_07]: In Hampshire, England in 1926, the game has playing pieces to represent the characters, miniature murder weapon props, two six-sided dice, three sets of cards that have the rooms the characters are weapons, solution cards, and an envelope.

1009
01:24:52,952 --> 01:25:09,001
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, in some cases it's a mirror, but it includes one card from each set of cards and then the detective's notepads that you can use to keep notes on the game, although we were prohibited by, you know, threat of exile to use those.

1010
01:25:09,001 --> 01:25:12,603
[SPEAKER_07]: We all had, we had like little notebooks that were actually in the box.

1011
01:25:13,909 --> 01:25:31,708
[SPEAKER_07]: So, in the UK version for your characters, you had Dr. Black, who was the victim, in the US it was Mr. Body, which is now just making me think, I butthole.

1012
01:25:31,708 --> 01:25:33,510
[SPEAKER_07]: Talking about Mr. Body's butler.

1013
01:25:33,510 --> 01:25:34,411
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yes, I butthole, sir.

1014
01:25:37,167 --> 01:25:44,838
[SPEAKER_07]: In the 2023 version, there's a reference to him as Bodden Body Black Jr.

1015
01:25:46,774 --> 01:25:51,175
[SPEAKER_07]: So you either have little pawns or figurines, depending on your version.

1016
01:25:51,175 --> 01:25:55,476
[SPEAKER_07]: So you have Miss Scarlet, who is a femme fatale.

1017
01:25:55,476 --> 01:26:00,158
[SPEAKER_07]: Colonel Mustard, who is a retired military officer of a distinguished career.

1018
01:26:00,158 --> 01:26:07,679
[SPEAKER_07]: Mrs. White, who is the chief domestic servant, as in housekeeper or cook.

1019
01:26:07,679 --> 01:26:09,240
[SPEAKER_07]: She's been called Chef White before.

1020
01:26:11,821 --> 01:26:20,769
[SPEAKER_07]: In 2016, she was replaced by Dr. Orchid, who was a biologist and adopted daughter of the victim.

1021
01:26:20,769 --> 01:26:23,231
[SPEAKER_07]: And then she was replaced by Chef White.

1022
01:26:23,231 --> 01:26:37,882
[SPEAKER_07]: So there was Reverend Green, also known as Mayor Green, the clergyman, who was, you know, also called Mr. Green here in the U.S., who is a middle-aged businessman with possible criminal connections.

1023
01:26:38,803 --> 01:26:41,925
[SPEAKER_07]: and turned into a handsome playboy.

1024
01:26:41,925 --> 01:26:51,951
[SPEAKER_07]: There's Mrs. Peacock, who is a widowed socialite, although in 2023 there was Solicitor Peacock.

1025
01:26:51,951 --> 01:26:58,835
[SPEAKER_07]: And then Professor Plum, who is an intelligent, absent-minded professor, or academic of sorts.

1026
01:26:58,835 --> 01:27:05,359
[SPEAKER_07]: The weapons that you have are the candlestick, the dagger, the lead pipe, or lead piping as it was in the UK,

1027
01:27:06,219 --> 01:27:07,581
[SPEAKER_07]: The Revolver.

1028
01:27:07,581 --> 01:27:14,571
[SPEAKER_07]: In the UK, it was originally a Dreyse M1907 semi-automatic pistol.

1029
01:27:14,571 --> 01:27:18,016
[SPEAKER_07]: In North America, it was a Colt M1911 pistol.

1030
01:27:18,016 --> 01:27:23,023
[SPEAKER_07]: There was the Rope and the Spanner, which in the US was called the Wrench.

1031
01:27:25,492 --> 01:27:29,535
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I mean, I'm not going to go into, like, the super gameplay or the super rules.

1032
01:27:29,535 --> 01:27:33,698
[SPEAKER_07]: I just wanted to give a little bit of high level on it.

1033
01:27:33,698 --> 01:27:39,021
[SPEAKER_07]: But there are advantages to which character that you play.

1034
01:27:39,021 --> 01:27:47,988
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, Mrs. Peacock has an immediate advantage of starting one space closer to the first room than any of the other players, if you play by the rules.

1035
01:27:48,528 --> 01:27:55,973
[SPEAKER_07]: Professor Plum can move to the study and take a secret passage to the kitchen, which is the hardest room to reach, so he has that.

1036
01:27:55,973 --> 01:27:56,533
[SPEAKER_07]: And Ms.

1037
01:27:56,533 --> 01:28:01,977
[SPEAKER_07]: Scarlet has the advantage of moving first, in the traditional rules.

1038
01:28:01,977 --> 01:28:05,519
[SPEAKER_07]: So, as for the additions, hoo boy!

1039
01:28:07,227 --> 01:28:18,693
[SPEAKER_07]: There were unique editions between Parker Brothers and Waddingtons, and then Hasbro bought both versions and, you know, just basically changed the labels for market.

1040
01:28:18,693 --> 01:28:26,637
[SPEAKER_07]: There were eight unique editions published in North America, including travel editions, miniature travel editions.

1041
01:28:26,637 --> 01:28:32,980
[SPEAKER_07]: Three distinct Cluedo in the UK, the longest, which ran 47 years from its introduction in 1949.

1042
01:28:36,892 --> 01:28:50,628
[SPEAKER_07]: The 8th North American and 4th UK editions have a shared design, and the international ones had some of their own unique designs, but most of them drew off of the UK or US ones.

1043
01:28:52,490 --> 01:29:02,497
[SPEAKER_07]: In July 2008, Hasbro released a revamped Clue called Clue Discover the Secrets and it offered some major changes.

1044
01:29:02,497 --> 01:29:07,680
[SPEAKER_07]: So that was when Dr. Orchid came out and some of the rooms were changed.

1045
01:29:07,680 --> 01:29:09,822
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, I think it went back.

1046
01:29:10,662 --> 01:29:16,963
[SPEAKER_07]: So, um... There was also... Okay, so we had Cluedo discover the secrets.

1047
01:29:16,963 --> 01:29:20,604
[SPEAKER_07]: We had Clue the classic mystery game.

1048
01:29:20,604 --> 01:29:27,805
[SPEAKER_07]: There was Clue master detective with 12 rooms, 10 characters, and 8 weapons for up to 10 players.

1049
01:29:27,805 --> 01:29:35,467
[SPEAKER_07]: And they added in Miss Peach, Miss Silbrunette, Madame Rose, and Sergeant Grey to the list of the suspects.

1050
01:29:35,467 --> 01:29:37,487
[SPEAKER_07]: It also added poison and a horseshoe.

1051
01:29:38,543 --> 01:29:41,565
[SPEAKER_07]: Other rooms added were the Fountain, the Gazebo, and the Carriage House.

1052
01:29:54,642 --> 01:29:56,344
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1053
01:29:56,344 --> 01:30:06,314
[SPEAKER_07]: So there was the 50th Anniversary Edition that had a deluxe format with an option to play with an extra murder weapon, which is the bottle of poison.

1054
01:30:06,314 --> 01:30:10,758
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was also issued as a miniature version.

1055
01:30:10,758 --> 01:30:16,084
[SPEAKER_07]: There was Clue Nostalgia Edition that was basically a reissue of the 1963 game in a wooden box.

1056
01:30:19,046 --> 01:30:28,408
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, there was the Vintage Edition, which, uh, was, like, a, it was that bookshelf collection.

1057
01:30:28,408 --> 01:30:32,749
[SPEAKER_07]: So, which, we still sometimes see it, uh, TJ Maxx.

1058
01:30:32,749 --> 01:30:38,791
[SPEAKER_07]: But, oh, goodness, the game has spawned so many things.

1059
01:30:42,033 --> 01:30:56,885
[SPEAKER_07]: We have had Clue VCR Mystery Game from 1985, which is what Rob was referring to, and it became the fourth best-selling videocassette in 1985.

1060
01:30:56,885 --> 01:31:00,528
[SPEAKER_07]: Above it were Beverly Hills Cops, Star Trek III, and Ghostbusters.

1061
01:31:02,191 --> 01:31:06,433
[SPEAKER_07]: and Games listed it as one of the top 100 games of the year.

1062
01:31:06,433 --> 01:31:17,918
[SPEAKER_07]: There was Super Cluedo Challenge, which was an advanced version that had Captain Brown, Miss Peach, and Mr. Slate gray, and the weapons were a Blunderbuss Poison and Axe for extra ones.

1063
01:31:17,918 --> 01:31:30,623
[SPEAKER_07]: There was a Clue VCR 2, Murder in Disguise, Clue Master Detective, which was that big copy, Clue Junior, Case of the Missing Pet for children, Travel Clue,

1064
01:31:31,323 --> 01:31:38,473
[SPEAKER_07]: Cluedo the Great Museum Caper, Cluedo Card Game, Clue Little Detective, Jr.

1065
01:31:38,473 --> 01:31:42,738
[SPEAKER_07]: Cluedo, Travel Clue Jr., Cluedo Super Sleuth, Clue Jr.

1066
01:31:42,738 --> 01:31:48,245
[SPEAKER_07]: The Case of the Hidden Toys, Cluedo Passport to Murder, which is just a cool name, I would read that book.

1067
01:31:49,022 --> 01:32:04,401
[SPEAKER_07]: Cluedo Card Game, Cluedo SFX, which was released as ClueFX, or Super Cluedo Interactif, which was... was that?

1068
01:32:04,401 --> 01:32:06,043
[SPEAKER_07]: That wasn't the SNES one, was it?

1069
01:32:08,612 --> 01:32:09,132
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think so.

1070
01:32:09,132 --> 01:32:10,753
[SPEAKER_07]: No, anyway, I don't think so.

1071
01:32:10,753 --> 01:32:12,494
[SPEAKER_07]: There was the SNES one.

1072
01:32:12,494 --> 01:32:13,455
[SPEAKER_07]: There was Cluedo Jr.

1073
01:32:13,455 --> 01:32:16,877
[SPEAKER_07]: The Case of the Missing Cake, which would have been in Matami.

1074
01:32:16,877 --> 01:32:24,141
[SPEAKER_07]: Clue Mysteries, Cluedo DVD, Cluedo Party, Clue Express, Cluedo Discover the Secrets, that was released as Clue.

1075
01:32:24,141 --> 01:32:26,823
[SPEAKER_07]: Cluedo Carnival, The Case of the Missing Prizes.

1076
01:32:26,823 --> 01:32:29,945
[SPEAKER_07]: There's Secrets in Paris, Secrets in Spies.

1077
01:32:29,945 --> 01:32:30,845
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my God, there's so many.

1078
01:32:30,845 --> 01:32:32,807
[SPEAKER_07]: Several card games.

1079
01:32:32,807 --> 01:32:37,409
[SPEAKER_07]: Clue Elimination, that uses four Nerf Jolt EX-1 Blasters.

1080
01:32:38,810 --> 01:32:42,915
[SPEAKER_07]: It was the Classic Mystery, all kinds of... Oh my god, there's just so many of them.

1081
01:32:42,915 --> 01:32:45,057
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we don't have to go over them all.

1082
01:32:45,057 --> 01:32:48,180
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fine.

1083
01:32:48,180 --> 01:32:49,041
[SPEAKER_07]: Whose segment is this?

1084
01:32:52,085 --> 01:32:53,126
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob, I'm teasing.

1085
01:32:53,126 --> 01:32:56,809
[SPEAKER_07]: I wasn't going to go over all of them.

1086
01:32:56,809 --> 01:32:59,031
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, so here's where I wanted to get into the video games.

1087
01:32:59,031 --> 01:33:16,264
[SPEAKER_07]: So there were video game versions on the Commodore 64, MSX, Atari ST, PC, Game Boy Advance, ZX Spectrum, Nintendo DS, Nintendo Switch, Super Nintendo, CD-i, Sega, Mega Drive, Genesis, PC, Mac, Xbox 360, and on iOS.

1088
01:33:16,264 --> 01:33:19,967
[SPEAKER_07]: And many, many more.

1089
01:33:19,967 --> 01:33:21,028
[SPEAKER_07]: And then there was the movie.

1090
01:33:21,845 --> 01:33:29,227
[SPEAKER_07]: It bombed in the box office, but later on got a massive cult following, and we love it.

1091
01:33:30,663 --> 01:33:33,544
[SPEAKER_07]: and there is an upcoming film.

1092
01:33:33,544 --> 01:33:43,747
[SPEAKER_07]: This was though announced in 2008 that Hasbro licensed some of their board games to Universal Pictures including Clue.

1093
01:33:43,747 --> 01:33:52,050
[SPEAKER_07]: They announced that Ryan Reynolds would be in it and then Jason Bateman and then

1094
01:33:53,050 --> 01:33:56,054
[SPEAKER_07]: Lots of people, so it's gone on and on.

1095
01:33:56,054 --> 01:34:00,218
[SPEAKER_07]: There have been live Clue game shows and Cluedo game shows.

1096
01:34:00,218 --> 01:34:08,928
[SPEAKER_07]: A TV series on The Hub had a five-part miniseries, and I didn't watch this, and now I kind of want to.

1097
01:34:08,928 --> 01:34:09,749
[SPEAKER_07]: A documentary.

1098
01:34:10,973 --> 01:34:16,235
[SPEAKER_07]: There has been Clue the Musical that ran off Broadway in 1997.

1099
01:34:16,235 --> 01:34:18,776
[SPEAKER_07]: Another play, Clue on Stage.

1100
01:34:18,776 --> 01:34:24,898
[SPEAKER_07]: The book of Clue, which I have the novelization somewhere in my collection.

1101
01:34:24,898 --> 01:34:30,340
[SPEAKER_07]: And if I am right, it had an ending in it that was not in the movie.

1102
01:34:30,340 --> 01:34:31,220
[SPEAKER_07]: Just saying.

1103
01:34:31,220 --> 01:34:33,901
[SPEAKER_07]: It was comics, jigsaw puzzles.

1104
01:34:33,901 --> 01:34:36,142
[SPEAKER_07]: If they could market something about it, they would.

1105
01:34:38,159 --> 01:34:48,342
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, yeah, Clue has been listed as one of the top 100 games released ever.

1106
01:34:48,342 --> 01:34:56,885
[SPEAKER_07]: It has been licensed in languages, other locations, and given that this is the last of these for the year,

1107
01:34:57,905 --> 01:35:08,874
[SPEAKER_07]: I also thought that there are two other games, one of them which Rob mentioned, that are spiritual successors, and that would be 13 Dead End Drive.

1108
01:35:08,874 --> 01:35:15,038
[SPEAKER_07]: There's Kill Dr. Lucky, Orient Express, Mystery, and Whodunit.

1109
01:35:15,038 --> 01:35:15,559
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's it!

1110
01:35:16,980 --> 01:35:17,961
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

1111
01:35:17,961 --> 01:35:28,290
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a heck of a huge game that's had a lot of impact on the industry to wrap up the year of the classic non-video games.

1112
01:35:28,290 --> 01:35:30,432
[SPEAKER_01]: Clue?

1113
01:35:30,432 --> 01:35:34,115
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, there is an MSX version, Dark Tetsuya.

1114
01:35:34,115 --> 01:35:34,575
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1115
01:35:34,575 --> 01:35:42,902
[SPEAKER_07]: But this game... It's impossible not to bring up much more with it just because it has such a massive legacy.

1116
01:35:42,902 --> 01:35:43,763
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, for sure.

1117
01:35:43,763 --> 01:35:44,023
[SPEAKER_07]: So...

1118
01:35:45,410 --> 01:35:56,714
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, since that was the last special monthly segment of the year, let's take a trip down memory lane and recap, in the archives, every non-video game pick for the year.

1119
01:35:56,714 --> 01:36:01,755
[SPEAKER_01]: So, this is the roster of our classic non-video games for 2023.

1120
01:36:01,755 --> 01:36:04,596
[SPEAKER_01]: So, in January, we had Mall Madness.

1121
01:36:04,596 --> 01:36:05,817
[SPEAKER_01]: February, Jenga.

1122
01:36:07,131 --> 01:36:08,933
[SPEAKER_01]: March, we had Simon.

1123
01:36:08,933 --> 01:36:10,674
[SPEAKER_01]: April, we had Bop It.

1124
01:36:10,674 --> 01:36:12,836
[SPEAKER_01]: May, we had Operation.

1125
01:36:12,836 --> 01:36:15,178
[SPEAKER_01]: June, we had Mousetrap.

1126
01:36:15,178 --> 01:36:18,220
[SPEAKER_01]: In July, you were caught in the Crossfire.

1127
01:36:18,220 --> 01:36:21,603
[SPEAKER_01]: In August, we had Don't Break the Ice.

1128
01:36:21,603 --> 01:36:24,105
[SPEAKER_01]: September was Connect Four.

1129
01:36:24,105 --> 01:36:26,507
[SPEAKER_01]: October was Mystery Date.

1130
01:36:26,507 --> 01:36:29,289
[SPEAKER_01]: Last month, November, was Guess Who?

1131
01:36:29,289 --> 01:36:33,772
[SPEAKER_01]: And then December, of course, Clue or Cluedo, if you're in the rest of the world.

1132
01:36:35,213 --> 01:36:35,673
[SPEAKER_01]: There it is.

1133
01:36:35,673 --> 01:36:39,254
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't know what I'm doing next.

1134
01:36:39,254 --> 01:36:39,994
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's OK.

1135
01:36:39,994 --> 01:36:40,834
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still early in the month.

1136
01:36:40,834 --> 01:36:42,475
[SPEAKER_01]: I forgot what I came up with.

1137
01:36:42,475 --> 01:36:45,096
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still early in the month, so we have a long time to figure it out.

1138
01:36:45,096 --> 01:36:49,817
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll... I think I was doing, like, cancelled game of the month.

1139
01:36:49,817 --> 01:36:52,297
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that could be interesting.

1140
01:36:52,297 --> 01:37:01,580
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I want to say that I was going to do a cancelled game of the month because, like, I got on the thought of it by looking at Robotech Crystal Dreams.

1141
01:37:01,580 --> 01:37:01,760
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm-hmm.

1142
01:37:03,635 --> 01:37:08,018
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, Capcom fighting all-stars in some of those other games.

1143
01:37:08,018 --> 01:37:15,822
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I think that that's going to be my theme is cancelled classic video game of the month.

1144
01:37:15,822 --> 01:37:17,003
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a good one.

1145
01:37:17,003 --> 01:37:25,008
[SPEAKER_05]: Or like even in the future, you could do like classic video game company that's no longer around or something like that.

1146
01:37:25,008 --> 01:37:25,908
[SPEAKER_07]: It could be on the list.

1147
01:37:25,908 --> 01:37:29,590
[SPEAKER_01]: As opposed to a classic video game or as a cancelled video game, a cancelled company.

1148
01:37:29,590 --> 01:37:30,351
[SPEAKER_01]: That could be interesting.

1149
01:37:32,433 --> 01:37:36,957
[SPEAKER_05]: I nominate Westwood Studios.

1150
01:37:36,957 --> 01:37:41,201
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the games that I would put on this list, technically, I already covered.

1151
01:37:41,201 --> 01:37:42,502
[SPEAKER_07]: Two of them, I think.

1152
01:37:42,502 --> 01:37:45,105
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because didn't you do Philebus?

1153
01:37:45,105 --> 01:37:46,946
[SPEAKER_07]: I did.

1154
01:37:46,946 --> 01:37:48,468
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, no, because that wasn't a real game.

1155
01:37:48,468 --> 01:37:49,448
[SPEAKER_07]: That was just a rumor.

1156
01:37:49,448 --> 01:37:50,870
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I thought somebody was actually trying to do it.

1157
01:37:50,870 --> 01:37:55,654
[SPEAKER_07]: But for actual classic games, cancelled games, I did Space Fantasy Zone.

1158
01:37:58,621 --> 01:38:00,722
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the way OrangeWrite phrases it in chat.

1159
01:38:00,722 --> 01:38:04,463
[SPEAKER_01]: What could have been the classic game of the week?

1160
01:38:04,463 --> 01:38:05,364
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm down for that.

1161
01:38:05,364 --> 01:38:07,385
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm down for that.

1162
01:38:07,385 --> 01:38:07,785
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

1163
01:38:07,785 --> 01:38:14,068
[SPEAKER_07]: There may be some repeats that I covered before, but they have their purpose.

1164
01:38:14,068 --> 01:38:14,448
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

1165
01:38:14,448 --> 01:38:20,250
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let's get into some rapid fire news and talk about some other quick headlines for the week.

1166
01:38:20,250 --> 01:38:24,092
[SPEAKER_01]: Loki, I think you just have a pair of stories for us, then we'll get to the release dates around the world.

1167
01:38:24,625 --> 01:38:26,186
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, yes, yes.

1168
01:38:26,186 --> 01:38:38,992
[SPEAKER_05]: The news I have been waiting for, the confirmation of when we can expect Grand Theft Auto VI's trailer to drop, and that is Tuesday mornings at 9 a.m.

1169
01:38:38,992 --> 01:38:40,853
[SPEAKER_05]: Eastern Standard Time.

1170
01:38:40,853 --> 01:38:42,234
[SPEAKER_05]: Or I guess Eastern Time.

1171
01:38:42,234 --> 01:38:44,775
[SPEAKER_01]: Which means I'm still asleep here.

1172
01:38:44,775 --> 01:38:49,317
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm still asleep, but the first thing I do when I wake up is watching that trailer.

1173
01:38:49,317 --> 01:38:49,838
[SPEAKER_05]: Can't wait.

1174
01:38:50,925 --> 01:39:03,170
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, it's funny is it, you know, there's been already leaks out from the game from allegedly some, uh, Rockstar head developer's, uh, son.

1175
01:39:03,170 --> 01:39:09,432
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it'll be interesting because the trailer should help, you know, either it's going to prove these leaks true or proven false.

1176
01:39:09,432 --> 01:39:09,932
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no, no.

1177
01:39:09,932 --> 01:39:12,353
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, all the leaks are, the leaks are true.

1178
01:39:12,353 --> 01:39:16,775
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, obviously like we had development gameplay, uh, it's in Vice City.

1179
01:39:16,775 --> 01:39:18,796
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, it's absolutely in Vice City.

1180
01:39:18,796 --> 01:39:18,956
[SPEAKER_05]: Like,

1181
01:39:19,921 --> 01:39:22,343
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not even up to question.

1182
01:39:22,343 --> 01:39:24,184
[SPEAKER_05]: So, it'll be interesting to see.

1183
01:39:24,184 --> 01:39:30,409
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to see the details of it, because obviously, Red Dead pushed the graphics and everything even more.

1184
01:39:30,409 --> 01:39:32,591
[SPEAKER_05]: This is going to push it even more.

1185
01:39:32,591 --> 01:39:38,416
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's going to be, like, five is such a detailed game, like, so much.

1186
01:39:38,416 --> 01:39:40,938
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I'm just absolutely excited.

1187
01:39:41,986 --> 01:39:45,972
[SPEAKER_05]: I will stop playing Minecraft for this game.

1188
01:39:45,972 --> 01:39:49,496
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the biggest piece of this news is that it's not the Game Awards.

1189
01:39:49,496 --> 01:39:53,682
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, a lot of people, a lot of us, us included, we're kind of jumping to the conclusion that, oh, it must be a part of the Game Awards.

1190
01:39:53,682 --> 01:39:55,665
[SPEAKER_05]: There still could be something there.

1191
01:39:55,665 --> 01:39:57,868
[SPEAKER_05]: They could have a second trailer or something.

1192
01:39:57,868 --> 01:39:58,409
[SPEAKER_05]: You never know.

1193
01:39:58,834 --> 01:40:00,877
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't wait either, I will watch all of them.

1194
01:40:14,697 --> 01:40:18,738
[SPEAKER_05]: I will not be hosting them, I will be watching them.

1195
01:40:18,738 --> 01:40:32,041
[SPEAKER_05]: One of my go-to things back in the day was GTA 5 o'clock, and they're coming back for GTA 6 o'clock, and I cannot wait to watch them dive into all of that.

1196
01:40:32,041 --> 01:40:35,261
[SPEAKER_05]: That is gonna be my day, for sure.

1197
01:40:35,261 --> 01:40:41,182
[SPEAKER_05]: Something that's not quite my day is still the idea that they're even gonna do a live-action Minecraft movie.

1198
01:40:41,182 --> 01:40:42,603
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, animated, yes.

1199
01:40:42,603 --> 01:40:43,543
[SPEAKER_05]: Live-action, what?

1200
01:40:44,364 --> 01:40:45,064
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

1201
01:40:45,064 --> 01:40:48,926
[SPEAKER_05]: That doesn't make any sense, but it's still going forward.

1202
01:40:48,926 --> 01:41:02,033
[SPEAKER_05]: And now we have the update from Deadline that says that they have added Daniel Brooks and Sebastian Eugene Hansen to the movie's roster.

1203
01:41:02,033 --> 01:41:05,355
[SPEAKER_05]: They have unnamed roles so far.

1204
01:41:05,355 --> 01:41:09,297
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't know who they're going to play.

1205
01:41:09,297 --> 01:41:12,219
[SPEAKER_05]: The movie is set to release... God, really?

1206
01:41:13,522 --> 01:41:17,385
[SPEAKER_03]: is set to release April 5th.

1207
01:41:17,385 --> 01:41:18,166
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

1208
01:41:18,166 --> 01:41:20,988
[SPEAKER_02]: How?

1209
01:41:20,988 --> 01:41:22,290
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1210
01:41:22,290 --> 01:41:24,151
[SPEAKER_05]: That's shocking right there.

1211
01:41:24,151 --> 01:41:26,493
[SPEAKER_05]: Allegedly coming out April 5th.

1212
01:41:26,493 --> 01:41:28,275
[SPEAKER_05]: Of 2026.

1213
01:41:28,275 --> 01:41:31,658
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that I want... No, 2024.

1214
01:41:31,658 --> 01:41:34,460
[SPEAKER_05]: That's still surprising.

1215
01:41:34,460 --> 01:41:35,221
[SPEAKER_05]: And... I...

1216
01:41:40,133 --> 01:41:46,116
[SPEAKER_05]: The other thing about this though, like, I don't want to be this person, but I'm going to.

1217
01:41:46,116 --> 01:41:49,577
[SPEAKER_05]: It is a Warner Brothers movie.

1218
01:41:49,577 --> 01:42:01,343
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a chance that they'll still cancel it, but no, I mean, yeah, they'll put this out, but they'll cancel, you know, Wile E. Cody and the Roadrunner and stuff.

1219
01:42:02,475 --> 01:42:04,356
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll watch it no matter what.

1220
01:42:04,356 --> 01:42:05,937
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got Jason Momoa in it.

1221
01:42:05,937 --> 01:42:08,318
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll watch it.

1222
01:42:08,318 --> 01:42:10,499
[SPEAKER_05]: How bad can it be?

1223
01:42:10,499 --> 01:42:11,960
[SPEAKER_01]: Famous last words.

1224
01:42:11,960 --> 01:42:14,661
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got my curiosity.

1225
01:42:14,661 --> 01:42:15,302
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1226
01:42:15,302 --> 01:42:15,762
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

1227
01:42:15,762 --> 01:42:21,705
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, before we wrap up tonight, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and what's coming out in different countries around the world.

1228
01:42:21,705 --> 01:42:23,146

1232
01:42:33,509 --> 01:42:37,171
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm guessing that PlayStation 5 is PlayStation VR 2.

1233
01:42:37,171 --> 01:42:43,376
[SPEAKER_05]: Born of Bread on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series.

[SPEAKER_05]: That's on PlayStation 5.

1247
01:43:38,670 --> 01:43:41,332

1252
01:44:26,310 --> 01:44:27,912
[SPEAKER_05]: Nintendo Switch.

1253

[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

1254
01:44:28,753 --> 01:44:29,034
[SPEAKER_05]: Enjoy.

1255
01:44:29,642 --> 01:44:32,866

1256
01:44:32,866 --> 01:44:33,967

1263
01:45:29,435 --> 01:45:40,609
[SPEAKER_01]: Old School Black and White Mac had the Shanghai, which was just Solitaire Mahjong, like the quintessential game that is still being made, and there's that on the Switch this week on December the 7th.

1264
01:45:40,609 --> 01:45:45,475
[SPEAKER_01]: Gigantosaurus, the game, if maybe that's more up your alley than Mahjong, that is out as well.

1265
01:45:45,976 --> 01:45:53,018
[SPEAKER_01]: Taiko no Tatsujin Fitbachi is also out from Bandai Namco as well, because that surprised me.

1266
01:45:53,018 --> 01:45:54,878
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that is an accessory, actually.

1267
01:45:54,878 --> 01:45:58,619
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actual little sticks that you can put the controllers on.

1268
01:45:58,619 --> 01:46:00,200
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not actually a game.

1269
01:46:00,200 --> 01:46:09,642
[SPEAKER_01]: It is little sticks to tie to your little Switch controllers to get the authentic drumming experience from those games.

1270
01:46:09,642 --> 01:46:13,103
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's take a look quickly at the PlayStation 5 and what might be out this next week.

1271
01:46:14,904 --> 01:46:19,927
[SPEAKER_01]: In Japan, we have the Avatar game, Frontiers of Pandora, also releases in Japan.

1272
01:46:19,927 --> 01:46:26,051

1273
01:46:26,051 --> 01:46:28,353
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it for this week on the PS5.

1274
01:46:28,353 --> 01:46:31,795
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go over to Europe!

1275
01:46:31,795 --> 01:46:32,936
[SPEAKER_07]: Can we, for real?

1276
01:46:32,936 --> 01:46:33,536
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, anyway.

1277
01:46:33,536 --> 01:46:34,417

1282
01:46:57,117 --> 01:47:02,843

1283
01:47:02,843 --> 01:47:07,527
[SPEAKER_07]: On the 7th for computers, we have Sims 4 for Rent.

1285
01:47:14,762 --> 01:47:20,327
[SPEAKER_07]: For computers, Xbox, PlayStation, we have Avatar, Frontiers of Pandora.

1291
01:47:49,304 --> 01:47:50,325
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

1292
01:47:50,325 --> 01:47:50,765
[SPEAKER_01]: Very cool.

1293
01:47:51,653 --> 01:47:52,995
[SPEAKER_01]: Dun dun dun!

1294
01:47:52,995 --> 01:47:53,775
[SPEAKER_01]: Dun dun dun.

1295
01:47:53,775 --> 01:47:58,281
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, let's move into this final segment here.

1296
01:47:58,281 --> 01:48:08,172
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if we will have a lot for this segment tonight, but I will quickly invite those of you in chat that have any questions or other topics we didn't talk about that you want to bring up for our listener roundtable.

1297
01:48:08,172 --> 01:48:11,375
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do that live over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network.

1298
01:48:12,456 --> 01:48:13,697
[SPEAKER_01]: We also invite your emails.

1299
01:48:13,697 --> 01:48:15,377
[SPEAKER_07]: The mailbox is barren.

1300
01:48:15,377 --> 01:48:16,958
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we'll ask again.

1301
01:48:16,958 --> 01:48:22,840
[SPEAKER_01]: Participate at orangelandrade.com if you want to send us an email for a future week.

1302
01:48:22,840 --> 01:48:27,982
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, we can also always take calls live here on our Discord server, vognetwork.com.

1303
01:48:27,982 --> 01:48:34,425
[SPEAKER_01]: I will also look to Loki as I usually do to see if there's any last minute stories tonight.

1304
01:48:34,425 --> 01:48:39,167
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not exactly a crazy busy week, but it was like it was not a crazy week, but

1305
01:48:39,967 --> 01:48:41,368
[SPEAKER_01]: We were reporting off of Reddit.

1306
01:48:41,368 --> 01:48:45,011
[SPEAKER_01]: That should note that it's a slow week.

1307
01:48:45,011 --> 01:48:45,632
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

1308
01:48:45,632 --> 01:48:54,158
[SPEAKER_05]: It should be noted that there was an update to Baldur's Gate 3 that added physics to the game.

1309
01:48:54,158 --> 01:48:55,700
[SPEAKER_05]: Jiggle physics.

1310
01:48:55,700 --> 01:48:59,343
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm glad that they are equal opportunity offenders.

1311
01:48:59,343 --> 01:49:03,306
[SPEAKER_05]: So there is, you know, cock and balls.

1312
01:49:03,306 --> 01:49:04,307
[SPEAKER_01]: Cock and balls.

1313
01:49:04,307 --> 01:49:05,848
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.

1314
01:49:05,848 --> 01:49:07,129
[SPEAKER_01]: Merry Christmas.

1315
01:49:10,632 --> 01:49:12,655
[SPEAKER_07]: It does seem like the type of thing that's up your alley.

1316
01:49:26,411 --> 01:49:32,954
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm worried if I play this game it's gonna be something I get sucked into like Elder Scrolls or something like that.

1317
01:49:32,954 --> 01:49:37,095
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it seems like it's just pretty cool like Dungeons & Dragons wise.

1318
01:49:37,095 --> 01:49:37,815
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh no!

1319
01:49:37,815 --> 01:49:40,757
[SPEAKER_01]: I might spend a lot of time on a really good game.

1320
01:49:40,757 --> 01:49:41,237
[SPEAKER_05]: I know!

1321
01:49:42,397 --> 01:49:44,399
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can multiplayer it.

1322
01:49:44,399 --> 01:49:47,882
[SPEAKER_01]: You can, but multiplayer can move really slow.

1323
01:49:47,882 --> 01:49:54,928
[SPEAKER_01]: And I learned the hard way from live streaming multiplayer that I actually did not enjoy the experience of live streaming multiplayer.

1324
01:49:54,928 --> 01:49:56,969
[SPEAKER_01]: And I talked about this.

1325
01:49:56,969 --> 01:50:00,212
[SPEAKER_01]: If I do play again, I probably will use a guide a little bit to help me out.

1326
01:50:00,212 --> 01:50:00,912
[SPEAKER_01]: Just be warned.

1327
01:50:00,912 --> 01:50:05,396
[SPEAKER_01]: The only thing is, it's very easy to do something stupid that wrecks your whole game.

1328
01:50:05,396 --> 01:50:06,257
[SPEAKER_01]: So save often.

1329
01:50:08,178 --> 01:50:10,619
[SPEAKER_01]: or use a guide to help you not make those mistakes.

1330
01:50:10,619 --> 01:50:12,980
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the only thing.

1331
01:50:12,980 --> 01:50:15,802
[SPEAKER_07]: Why don't we just have a tabletop game that we stream?

1332
01:50:15,802 --> 01:50:23,726
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I was promoting on the show the last couple of weeks a series that I did with the Tale of D20s, our friends over there, and it was a lot of fun.

1333
01:50:23,726 --> 01:50:26,507
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a lot of fun doing tabletop over there.

1334
01:50:26,507 --> 01:50:29,828
[SPEAKER_01]: I wonder if I could ask very, very, very nicely.

1335
01:50:29,828 --> 01:50:33,230
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe somebody over there would be willing to DM a game for us.

1336
01:50:33,230 --> 01:50:34,271
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that could be fun.

1337
01:50:37,353 --> 01:50:42,895
[SPEAKER_07]: I, I would, I should introduce you to my level of D&D, which was second edition.

1338
01:50:42,895 --> 01:50:44,155
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, well, I don't want to play that.

1339
01:50:44,155 --> 01:50:46,956
[SPEAKER_07]: It's too complicated.

1340
01:50:46,956 --> 01:50:48,396
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not that complicated.

1341
01:50:48,396 --> 01:50:52,537
[SPEAKER_07]: You just need a good DM.

1342
01:50:52,537 --> 01:50:58,799
[SPEAKER_07]: All you have to do is be able to do simple math and roll a d20.

1343
01:50:58,799 --> 01:51:00,500
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura says, y'all playing D&D?

1344
01:51:00,500 --> 01:51:01,340
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sign me up.

1345
01:51:01,340 --> 01:51:01,680
[SPEAKER_01]: Who knows?

1346
01:51:01,680 --> 01:51:03,320
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe, maybe a point redeem in the future.

1347
01:51:03,320 --> 01:51:03,741
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see.

1348
01:51:03,741 --> 01:51:04,421
[SPEAKER_01]: That could be fun.

1349
01:51:04,421 --> 01:51:05,121
[SPEAKER_01]: That could be a lot of fun.

1350
01:51:06,104 --> 01:51:10,809
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, well, I'm going to assume there's no other comments or questions, so that's okay.

1351
01:51:10,809 --> 01:51:14,212
[SPEAKER_01]: I still have some steps to go outside and get, even though it's dark, but that's alright.

1352
01:51:14,212 --> 01:51:17,655
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to wrap up our show tonight, but first we have to get final thoughts.

1353
01:51:17,655 --> 01:51:21,339
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do want to say, of course, as always, thank you for listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

1354
01:51:21,699 --> 01:51:24,461
[SPEAKER_01]: If you enjoyed what you heard here on the show, tell a friend or two about the show.

1355
01:51:24,461 --> 01:51:30,265
[SPEAKER_01]: Help us spread the word, because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we need more voices to put out here on air.

1356
01:51:30,265 --> 01:51:36,529
[SPEAKER_01]: A nice five-star review on a site like iTunes or Spotify or wherever it is you heard this show goes an awful long way.

1357
01:51:36,529 --> 01:51:41,272
[SPEAKER_01]: And as far as VOG Network is concerned, we will be here on Thursday night.

1358
01:51:41,272 --> 01:51:44,875
[SPEAKER_01]: At least Bobby and I will be to look at the Game Awards live.

1359
01:51:44,875 --> 01:51:50,298
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to get some fun announcements, so I can't wait to react to all of that stuff live with those of you.

1360
01:51:50,298 --> 01:51:50,959
[SPEAKER_01]: And again,

1361
01:51:52,940 --> 01:51:58,044
[SPEAKER_01]: There's other people out there live streaming it too, but do ask yourself, is it just going to be a shit on everything fest?

1362
01:51:58,044 --> 01:52:01,127
[SPEAKER_01]: Because unfortunately there's too many people out there that will just shit on everything.

1363
01:52:01,127 --> 01:52:04,189
[SPEAKER_01]: I promise you a shit free stream.

1364
01:52:04,189 --> 01:52:08,773
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we'll say 99% shit free stream here at VOG Network.

1365
01:52:08,773 --> 01:52:11,155
[SPEAKER_01]: That should be the branding.

1366
01:52:11,155 --> 01:52:12,616
[SPEAKER_01]: VOG Network, 99% shit free.

1367
01:52:16,821 --> 01:52:23,502
[SPEAKER_07]: I have learned that if someone prompts me hard enough on a stream, I'll start giving a full history lesson.

1368
01:52:23,502 --> 01:52:24,283
[SPEAKER_02]: All good, all good.

1369
01:52:24,283 --> 01:52:29,984
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, going into full-on scholar mode while I'm half asleep and slightly drunk.

1370
01:52:29,984 --> 01:52:31,484
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

1371
01:52:31,484 --> 01:52:41,606
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, DarkSakura, maybe not an entire history lesson for your final thought, but before you head off to start playing some Dead by Delight tonight, do you have a final thought for us tonight?

1372
01:52:41,606 --> 01:52:42,766
[SPEAKER_07]: Dead by Delight.

1373
01:52:42,766 --> 01:52:43,246
[SPEAKER_07]: I like it.

1374
01:52:44,395 --> 01:52:54,321
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I say look beyond the obvious and dig deeper into the history.

1375
01:52:54,321 --> 01:52:57,243
[SPEAKER_07]: Question what you're told.

1376
01:52:57,243 --> 01:53:01,505
[SPEAKER_01]: And when it's a trickster, DarkSakura, it's always death by delight.

1377
01:53:01,505 --> 01:53:02,586
[SPEAKER_07]: Step on me, Trickster Daddy.

1378
01:53:02,586 --> 01:53:04,928
[SPEAKER_07]: When it's a trickster, that's the bullshit.

1379
01:53:04,928 --> 01:53:06,048
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the bullshit.

1380
01:53:06,048 --> 01:53:07,829
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

1381
01:53:07,829 --> 01:53:08,370
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye.

1382
01:53:10,083 --> 01:53:13,346
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, let's move over next to Loki.

1383
01:53:13,346 --> 01:53:15,568
[SPEAKER_01]: Your final thought for us tonight.

1384
01:53:15,568 --> 01:53:18,791
[SPEAKER_05]: My final thought is I've got a lot of planning to do.

1385
01:53:18,791 --> 01:53:19,792
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of build planning.

1386
01:53:20,626 --> 01:53:22,147
[SPEAKER_01]: Fun.

1387
01:53:22,147 --> 01:53:23,847
[SPEAKER_01]: Minecraft City.

1388
01:53:23,847 --> 01:53:31,531
[SPEAKER_01]: And then my final thought is eventually I will tear myself away from one of these other ongoing games to catch up on my backlog.

1389
01:53:31,531 --> 01:53:33,972
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking right at Alan Wake Remastered and Control.

1390
01:53:33,972 --> 01:53:36,133
[SPEAKER_01]: I really want to play through that whole trilogy.

1391
01:53:36,133 --> 01:53:37,134
[SPEAKER_01]: Someday I'll get there.

1392
01:53:37,134 --> 01:53:37,714
[SPEAKER_01]: I will.

1393
01:53:37,714 --> 01:53:38,694
[SPEAKER_01]: Someday.

1394
01:53:38,694 --> 01:53:43,937
[SPEAKER_01]: Just not today because I have to go walking for my stupid badge in a stupid game that doesn't mean anything.

1395
01:53:43,937 --> 01:53:44,157
[SPEAKER_01]: But

1396
01:53:44,844 --> 01:53:45,344
[SPEAKER_05]: That's fine.

1397
01:53:45,344 --> 01:53:46,005
[SPEAKER_05]: What can I say?

1398
01:53:46,005 --> 01:53:46,505
[SPEAKER_05]: I get that.

1399
01:53:46,505 --> 01:53:52,709
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like back when we're playing Ingress and you have to go go hit your portal once a day.

1400
01:53:52,709 --> 01:53:53,909
[SPEAKER_05]: Otherwise, you'll break the streak.

1401
01:53:53,909 --> 01:53:54,950
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.

1402
01:53:54,950 --> 01:53:56,111
[SPEAKER_01]: What can I say?

1403
01:53:56,111 --> 01:53:59,293
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a dumb bitch for achievements.

1404
01:53:59,293 --> 01:54:01,294
[SPEAKER_01]: And on that note, have a great week, everybody.

1405
01:54:01,294 --> 01:54:02,314
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll see you next time.

1406
01:54:02,314 --> 01:54:03,695
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye.

1407
01:54:03,695 --> 01:54:08,238
[SPEAKER_04]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

1408
01:54:08,238 --> 01:54:11,540
[SPEAKER_04]: Orange Lounge Radio is a production of OLR Studios.
