1
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:15,514
[SPEAKER_05]: Twas the night before Christmas, and just now in this house, Jason clicked record using his noteball mouse.

2
00:00:15,514 --> 00:00:18,075
[SPEAKER_05]: The news keeps on coming, no hibernation in store.

3
00:00:18,075 --> 00:00:20,657
[SPEAKER_05]: Gamers keep clicking, no resting your score.

4
00:00:20,657 --> 00:00:25,380
[SPEAKER_05]: We're done for the year, after the closing bit, but worry not, 2024 is imminent.

5
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:27,342
[SPEAKER_05]: Rhyming is hard, especially with names.

6
00:00:27,342 --> 00:00:31,584
[SPEAKER_05]: Your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Sommers, and Loki, iambic pentameter arranged.

7
00:00:31,584 --> 00:00:33,786
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's get to the news, I bet you'll rejoice.

8
00:00:33,786 --> 00:00:36,588
[SPEAKER_05]: Tuned in to Orange Lounge Radio, where every gamer has a voice.

9
00:00:39,738 --> 00:00:53,310
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice it is Orange Lounge Radio live once again at a special time on this December 24th 2023

10

[SPEAKER_07]: with episode number 987 of our show.

11
00:00:57,252 --> 00:00:59,312
[SPEAKER_07]: If it sounds like I'm laughing, it's because I am.

12
00:00:59,312 --> 00:01:03,693
[SPEAKER_07]: That's actually the first time I heard Jason's special little rhymy intro for tonight.

13
00:01:03,693 --> 00:01:04,773
[SPEAKER_07]: That was super cute.

14
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:07,454
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, as always, to our voiceover guy, Jason.

15
00:01:07,454 --> 00:01:11,715
[SPEAKER_07]: And thank you to all of you who are tuning in live at this special time.

16
00:01:11,715 --> 00:01:20,597
[SPEAKER_07]: So usually we tape every week at The Voice of Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash VOG Network at 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific, right after the Bobby Blackwell Show.

17
00:01:20,597 --> 00:01:20,957
[SPEAKER_07]: However,

18
00:01:21,337 --> 00:01:24,018
[SPEAKER_07]: today being a special day, a holiday.

19
00:01:24,018 --> 00:01:34,723
[SPEAKER_07]: We are doing a special show at three Eastern, noon Pacific, and, you know, perhaps overseas eight o'clock, nine o'clock in the evening, depending on where you are overseas.

20
00:01:34,723 --> 00:01:38,465
[SPEAKER_07]: So just a little bit of a special time here on this Christmas Eve.

21
00:01:38,465 --> 00:01:47,069
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm Rob Roberts, and I'm joined as always, despite the day time difference on the day, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

22
00:01:50,515 --> 00:01:52,556
[SPEAKER_03]: who, there, hello.

23
00:01:52,556 --> 00:01:54,077
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm awake.

24
00:01:54,077 --> 00:01:58,379
[SPEAKER_03]: You're what?

25
00:01:58,379 --> 00:01:59,980
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I'm not sure what's happening with your music audio.

26
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:00,721
[SPEAKER_07]: I said I'm awake.

27
00:02:00,721 --> 00:02:02,121
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, you're awake.

28
00:02:02,121 --> 00:02:04,082
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just very lagged, I think, today.

29
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:05,723
[SPEAKER_01]: I like- I know what's happening with my audio.

30
00:02:05,723 --> 00:02:07,704
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same thing that happens every week.

31
00:02:07,704 --> 00:02:08,465
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

32
00:02:08,465 --> 00:02:09,265
[SPEAKER_01]: I have lag.

33
00:02:09,265 --> 00:02:10,326
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

34
00:02:10,326 --> 00:02:15,288
[SPEAKER_07]: It didn't used to be there, but I noticed you have, your VTuber is, where are you?

35
00:02:15,288 --> 00:02:17,269
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's been there for the last month or so.

36
00:02:19,315 --> 00:02:21,478
[SPEAKER_07]: I can scroll out if you want to see the whole thing.

37
00:02:21,478 --> 00:02:21,778
[SPEAKER_07]: Hold on.

38
00:02:21,778 --> 00:02:22,759
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's do this.

39
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:23,360
[SPEAKER_07]: Whoa.

40
00:02:37,981 --> 00:02:39,001
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that is super cute.

41
00:02:39,001 --> 00:02:39,942
[SPEAKER_07]: I like that.

42
00:02:39,942 --> 00:02:40,582
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

43
00:02:40,582 --> 00:02:45,243
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, if you want to see the video, of course, everyone's gonna see me playing with my sliders.

44
00:02:45,243 --> 00:02:46,323
[SPEAKER_07]: It's fine over at Twitch.

45
00:02:46,323 --> 00:02:53,965
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not the first time over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network is where you can check that out as we are live.

46
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:54,445
[SPEAKER_07]: And thank you.

47
00:02:54,445 --> 00:02:59,546
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, I want to acknowledge I see you all are being very generous with the hype train and chat right now.

48
00:02:59,546 --> 00:02:59,846
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

49
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:00,767
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you so much for that.

50
00:03:00,767 --> 00:03:05,748
[SPEAKER_07]: I really do appreciate that, especially the fact that it's a weird time today.

51
00:03:06,528 --> 00:03:11,633
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, also say hello joining us, of course, to the one and only Techmaster Loki.

52
00:03:11,633 --> 00:03:12,153
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello.

53
00:03:12,153 --> 00:03:12,594
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, Loki.

54
00:03:12,594 --> 00:03:13,635
[SPEAKER_07]: How are you?

55
00:03:13,635 --> 00:03:14,436
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm doing pretty good.

56
00:03:14,436 --> 00:03:15,056
[SPEAKER_07]: Good, good.

57
00:03:15,056 --> 00:03:16,778
[SPEAKER_07]: What is this game playing behind you tonight?

58
00:03:16,778 --> 00:03:17,539
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure.

59
00:03:17,539 --> 00:03:18,700
[SPEAKER_07]: Is this Power Washer?

60
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:21,923
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks... It is Power Washer.

61
00:03:21,923 --> 00:03:23,264
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I just haven't seen this level.

62
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:27,348
[SPEAKER_07]: This must be like a special like Santa's Workshop or something level.

63
00:03:27,348 --> 00:03:27,988
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

64
00:03:27,988 --> 00:03:29,390
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Santa's Workshop DLC.

65
00:03:30,259 --> 00:03:30,861
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, fun.

66
00:03:30,861 --> 00:03:31,482
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

67
00:03:31,482 --> 00:03:37,518
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I never did end up playing the Final Fantasy VII DLC, I think they had at one point.

68
00:03:38,264 --> 00:03:39,825
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, I have it.

69
00:03:39,825 --> 00:03:40,906
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't played it either.

70
00:03:40,906 --> 00:03:43,627
[SPEAKER_06]: Same with the Back to the Future one as well.

71
00:03:43,627 --> 00:03:47,570
[SPEAKER_07]: That game is the PlayStation Plus game right now.

72
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:50,692
[SPEAKER_07]: So a whole other reason to play it again.

73
00:03:50,692 --> 00:03:54,074
[SPEAKER_07]: If, you know, Game Pass or whatever other way of getting that game.

74
00:03:54,074 --> 00:03:58,676
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I just bought it on early access on Steam, quite honestly, isn't good enough.

75
00:03:58,676 --> 00:04:00,657
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, there's plenty of ways to check out PowerWash.

76
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:06,201
[SPEAKER_06]: They also have a VR version if you happen to be ever so inclined to play the VR stuff.

77
00:04:06,201 --> 00:04:06,341
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

78
00:04:06,661 --> 00:04:11,042
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, like, it surprises me, but it doesn't.

79
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:12,482
[SPEAKER_06]: I kind of want to play the VR version.

80
00:04:12,482 --> 00:04:13,403
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that'd be a lot of fun.

81
00:04:13,403 --> 00:04:14,423
[SPEAKER_07]: That might be interesting.

82
00:04:14,423 --> 00:04:15,563
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'd check that out.

83
00:04:15,563 --> 00:04:22,525
[SPEAKER_07]: But OK, wow, Santa's workshop is very dirty outside of that close rack, the immediate field of view.

84
00:04:22,525 --> 00:04:27,666
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, like the original game, the meta was that it was supposed to be a volcano that went off.

85
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:30,166
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't know how that has anything.

86
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:32,527
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's just an excuse to put dirt everywhere.

87
00:04:33,069 --> 00:04:40,614
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I'm sure there are lots of games folks are catching up on over this holiday break for many people or just even if it's a day or two.

88
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:45,116
[SPEAKER_07]: I know I am, but we'll talk about that in our gaming weeks in a little bit.

89
00:04:45,116 --> 00:04:47,017
[SPEAKER_07]: But first, we're going to get to our kickoff topic.

90
00:04:47,017 --> 00:04:54,982
[SPEAKER_07]: The news, of course, this week has been a little bit lighter, but we have had some pretty major stories, including this first one right off the bat about

91
00:04:56,403 --> 00:05:04,440
[SPEAKER_07]: this big thing that's happened and very interesting ethical questions coming out of this as well as far as like people reporting on it.

92
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:07,646
[SPEAKER_07]: But Loki, why don't you give us like the high level overview and then we'll talk about some of that.

93
00:05:08,393 --> 00:05:22,579
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so Insomniac Games was recently hit with a ransomware attack, and the folks that were attacking them wanted $2 million in Bitcoin in order for them not to leak their information.

94
00:05:22,579 --> 00:05:26,721
[SPEAKER_07]: Because Bitcoin is always for legitimate purposes, clearly.

95
00:05:26,721 --> 00:05:29,762
[SPEAKER_06]: It's supposed to be less traceable or something.

96
00:05:29,762 --> 00:05:32,303
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, Bitcoin's the official currency of crime.

97
00:05:32,303 --> 00:05:35,785
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, let's just call it what it is.

98
00:05:35,785 --> 00:05:36,906
[SPEAKER_06]: Put that tagline on there.

99
00:05:38,733 --> 00:06:01,674
[SPEAKER_06]: But yes, the hacking group responsible had requested 2 million in Bitcoin to prevent the data from being leaked, which that data included a lot of things, development stuff, there was an early working version of Wolverine, assets, also employee information, data, financial information, planning, all that type of stuff.

100
00:06:02,435 --> 00:06:02,855
[SPEAKER_06]: Marvel, Insomniac

101
00:06:17,846 --> 00:06:22,347
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for your outpouring of compassion and unwavering support.

102
00:06:22,347 --> 00:06:23,107
[SPEAKER_06]: It's deeply appreciated.

103
00:06:23,107 --> 00:06:31,669
[SPEAKER_06]: We're both saddened and angered about the recent criminal cyber attack on the studio and the emotional tale it's taken on our dev team.

104
00:06:44,091 --> 00:06:50,017
[SPEAKER_06]: We have focused inwardly for the last several days to support each other.

105
00:06:50,017 --> 00:06:51,559
[SPEAKER_06]: We're aware of the stolen data.

106
00:06:51,559 --> 00:06:57,024
[SPEAKER_06]: It includes personal information belonging to our employees, former employees, and independent contractors.

107
00:06:57,024 --> 00:07:02,410
[SPEAKER_06]: It also includes early developmental details about Marvel's Wolverine for PlayStation 5.

108
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:06,134
[SPEAKER_06]: We continue working quickly to determine what data was impacted.

109
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:19,512
[SPEAKER_06]: And then with that, they're just kind of saying, you know, we want everyone to enjoy the games that we're making, but we want you to also wait for that information to come out as we feel it's ready and necessary.

110
00:07:19,512 --> 00:07:19,752
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

111
00:07:21,618 --> 00:07:41,841
[SPEAKER_06]: So kind of like the whole thing I think is to focus like not on covering the leaked information because they feel it's going to you know and this same thing kind of happened with you know Grand Theft Auto 6 and stuff they they want you not to talk about it because one some people get like an impression like oh Wolverine looks terrible right now

112
00:07:42,722 --> 00:07:51,099
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's not anywhere near done yet, but you know, there are idiots out there that feel like this is representative of the final game, which it's obviously not.

113
00:07:53,428 --> 00:08:05,415
[SPEAKER_06]: It just also, it hopefully will dissuade people from trying to attack these companies in this similar type of way in order to, you know, leak information.

114
00:08:05,415 --> 00:08:11,559
[SPEAKER_06]: If they feel that it's not valuable to do so, then maybe they'll be less likely to do that.

115
00:08:11,559 --> 00:08:13,520
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, it sucks for them.

116
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:20,004
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, at the same time, like, it's fun seeing that stuff in progress, but I guess, you know, it does take a toll on the dev teams if you're

117
00:08:20,504 --> 00:08:22,945
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, kind of sharing all that leaked information out there.

118
00:08:22,945 --> 00:08:23,485
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah.

119
00:08:23,485 --> 00:08:26,606
[SPEAKER_06]: But people will do it because of clicks and engagement and clout.

120
00:08:26,606 --> 00:08:37,290
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, but also like, you know, I'm kind of on the fence because I feel like there are some people out there that are making, they're going out of their way to let you know, we are not going to cover these leaks.

121
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:38,810
[SPEAKER_07]: We are not going to talk about these leaks.

122
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:43,032
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's a part of me, I'm sorry, that's not going to be popular, but I'm just going to tell it like it is.

123
00:08:43,832 --> 00:08:48,293
[SPEAKER_07]: In some cases, and we'll make that very clear, some of that feels very performative.

124
00:08:48,293 --> 00:08:53,274
[SPEAKER_07]: And the reason why I use that word is because there was no problem when it was Capcom a few weeks ago.

125
00:08:53,274 --> 00:08:55,315
[SPEAKER_07]: There was no problem when it was Nintendo.

126
00:08:55,315 --> 00:08:57,395
[SPEAKER_07]: There was no problem when it was the ESA.

127
00:08:57,395 --> 00:08:58,376
[SPEAKER_07]: There was no problem.

128
00:08:58,376 --> 00:08:59,696
[SPEAKER_07]: And look, I understand.

129
00:08:59,696 --> 00:09:07,798
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm not saying, oh, we need to go over the, you know, I just think here at this show, like, you know, we talk about what people are talking about on social media.

130
00:09:08,238 --> 00:09:11,561
[SPEAKER_07]: I think to not acknowledge this has happened.

131
00:09:11,561 --> 00:09:12,682
[SPEAKER_07]: It's out there.

132
00:09:12,682 --> 00:09:14,524
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, they're talking about Wolverine.

133
00:09:14,524 --> 00:09:19,107
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, they've got these Marvel licenses on games through 2032 and all this stuff.

134
00:09:19,107 --> 00:09:20,509
[SPEAKER_07]: They've got these different licenses.

135
00:09:20,509 --> 00:09:21,970
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's kind of like

136
00:09:23,383 --> 00:09:29,248
[SPEAKER_07]: It's assuming that people only get their gaming news from this podcast, which I think is a ridiculous notion.

137
00:09:29,248 --> 00:09:37,234
[SPEAKER_07]: I realize there might be a couple people out there and thank you if that's you, but I think there's a lot of people out there that use social media and they know that this stuff is out there.

138
00:09:37,234 --> 00:09:40,976
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, look, I also understand that there is personal data in here.

139
00:09:40,976 --> 00:09:43,498
[SPEAKER_07]: There's people's phone numbers and that shit ain't cool.

140
00:09:43,498 --> 00:09:49,723
[SPEAKER_07]: And so like, no, we shouldn't talk about where to go find this or how to get the information for yourself and all this stuff.

141
00:09:50,403 --> 00:10:02,308
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I think we ought to say openly, yes, there is screenshots, there is gameplay of Wolverine out there, and if you think that is what the finished game is going to look like, you are a fool.

142
00:10:02,308 --> 00:10:03,049
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

143
00:10:03,049 --> 00:10:14,174
[SPEAKER_07]: If you think that that is representative of what the actual game is going to look like, you are a fool, and should not be commenting on the gaming industry, because you don't know how it works.

144
00:10:14,174 --> 00:10:16,075
[SPEAKER_07]: That's, and that's that on that.

145
00:10:16,075 --> 00:10:16,515
[SPEAKER_07]: Period.

146
00:10:16,515 --> 00:10:17,855
[SPEAKER_07]: Happy holidays.

147
00:10:17,855 --> 00:10:18,096
[SPEAKER_07]: So,

148
00:10:19,723 --> 00:10:24,107
[SPEAKER_07]: That's, that's, you know, what it is for the Wolverine.

149
00:10:24,107 --> 00:10:29,532
[SPEAKER_07]: And as far as the Marvel things go, I mean, look at the pattern.

150
00:10:29,532 --> 00:10:31,733
[SPEAKER_07]: Insomniac's been making a lot of Marvel games.

151
00:10:31,733 --> 00:10:33,955
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, they've been in talks to make more.

152
00:10:33,955 --> 00:10:38,699
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you think that that timeline is going to hold up and be exact one for one?

153
00:10:38,699 --> 00:10:39,040
[SPEAKER_07]: Haha!

154
00:10:39,827 --> 00:10:41,128
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely not.

155
00:10:41,128 --> 00:10:59,400
[SPEAKER_07]: Because if you think and you go out into 2034, or whenever the last game was projected there, we're going to be talking like PlayStation six, and fuck, maybe even PlayStation seven by then I don't maybe not quite, but we're almost on our way to PlayStation seven by then, like, do you think that those things don't change as a part of that?

156
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:03,303
[SPEAKER_07]: And based off the sales of other things that of course, that's all going to change.

157
00:11:03,303 --> 00:11:06,765
[SPEAKER_07]: All of that is projection period.

158
00:11:06,765 --> 00:11:06,825
[SPEAKER_07]: Um,

159
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:20,074
[SPEAKER_07]: as far as the leaks themselves again, I feel like Grand Theft Auto 6 trailer, even despite the fact that it leaked early, which is a whole other thing.

160
00:11:20,074 --> 00:11:26,916
[SPEAKER_07]: Even despite the fact that that came out early, it's still the talk of the town, all over news media, millions of clicks.

161
00:11:26,916 --> 00:11:30,437
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, didn't it break YouTube records and all this stuff too?

162
00:11:30,437 --> 00:11:35,299
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm not saying it's okay that it leaked out.

163
00:11:35,299 --> 00:11:37,740
[SPEAKER_07]: But I am saying it turned out okay.

164
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:44,381
[SPEAKER_07]: Gamers are still going to be hyped for the actual real thing and sharing that around and putting it on social media and so forth.

165
00:11:44,381 --> 00:11:46,482
[SPEAKER_07]: And then that's the stuff to get excited about.

166
00:11:46,482 --> 00:11:57,905
[SPEAKER_07]: Because then again, you know, when the Grand Theft Auto 6 trailer actually showed up, there were all these things in it that looked really cool that the leaks did not give any presence of because

167
00:11:59,813 --> 00:12:00,713
[SPEAKER_07]: It just wasn't in there.

168
00:12:00,713 --> 00:12:01,674
[SPEAKER_07]: It was too early development.

169
00:12:01,674 --> 00:12:02,594
[SPEAKER_07]: It wasn't polished enough.

170
00:12:02,594 --> 00:12:06,836
[SPEAKER_07]: We didn't see the TikTok or Instagram lifestyle parody stuff in there.

171
00:12:06,836 --> 00:12:09,578
[SPEAKER_07]: So we found out there's a female protagonist.

172
00:12:09,578 --> 00:12:10,818
[SPEAKER_07]: Whoopee!

173
00:12:10,818 --> 00:12:14,000
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what the leaks gave us.

174
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,381
[SPEAKER_07]: Context gave us so much more.

175
00:12:16,837 --> 00:12:19,979
[SPEAKER_07]: SheHulk10 in chat says, I love this comment by the way.

176
00:12:19,979 --> 00:12:26,383
[SPEAKER_07]: SheHulk10 says, we should be talking about the lack of security and other security failures.

177
00:12:26,383 --> 00:12:35,709
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is, and I don't want to pick on Insomniac because obviously they are, you know, bearing the brunt of that, but every company should be looking at this.

178
00:12:35,709 --> 00:12:38,871
[SPEAKER_07]: And to me, this whole situation was exacerbated

179
00:12:39,651 --> 00:13:01,426
[SPEAKER_07]: when E3 information got leaked a couple years ago by the ESA by the company that's supposed to represent the gaming industry and be on the cutting edge of this stuff, which as we have found, part of the many failures of the ESA is the fact that they are, they're usually behind the curve on this stuff, and behind the curve of where, you know, security and this stuff is.

180
00:13:02,679 --> 00:13:05,081
[SPEAKER_07]: So something to think about.

181
00:13:05,081 --> 00:13:08,763
[SPEAKER_07]: Bobby Blackwolf does say though, company stop hacks all the times.

182
00:13:08,763 --> 00:13:10,284
[SPEAKER_07]: You just don't hear about the ones they stop.

183
00:13:10,284 --> 00:13:12,786
[SPEAKER_07]: Funny enough, later today, you will hear about one story.

184
00:13:12,786 --> 00:13:14,067
[SPEAKER_07]: So we do have that coming.

185
00:13:14,067 --> 00:13:20,592
[SPEAKER_07]: But yes, I mean, there are a lot that are prevented, but there's unfortunately a lot that aren't.

186
00:13:20,592 --> 00:13:28,738
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think Insomniac may consider being a little bit transparent, especially with peers about how this happened, so that this can be stopped.

187
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:30,510
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what else to say.

188
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:35,152
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I'm sure there was more information in the hacks than just like the Marvel licenses and the Wolverine stuff, but it's like

189
00:13:57,668 --> 00:14:11,137
[SPEAKER_07]: how I mean it's it's all gonna change it's all gonna change you weren't supposed to see it for a reason yeah that's the reality of it so people yeah

190
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:12,540
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I know.

191
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:13,820
[SPEAKER_07]: But I will say, you know what's funny?

192
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:24,066
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I did see the Wolverine footage because occasionally I get directed to Twitter and I see related tweets and so I try to avoid that site, but it's just unfortunately it still is a news platform.

193
00:14:24,066 --> 00:14:28,448
[SPEAKER_07]: You unfortunately, if you're not checking it, you're not seeing some of the news.

194
00:14:29,008 --> 00:14:30,809
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'll get linked to tweets occasionally.

195
00:14:30,809 --> 00:14:33,450
[SPEAKER_07]: And I did come across some of the the I think it was screenshots.

196
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:34,371
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think there was video.

197
00:14:34,371 --> 00:14:35,651
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe there was I don't remember.

198
00:14:35,651 --> 00:14:36,352
[SPEAKER_07]: Screenshots were great.

199
00:14:36,352 --> 00:14:41,094
[SPEAKER_07]: And I will say for as early on as it is since that game, that game isn't out till like 2025.

200
00:14:41,094 --> 00:14:41,574
[SPEAKER_07]: Right?

201
00:14:41,574 --> 00:14:46,376
[SPEAKER_07]: So as early on as it is, from my perspective, it looks great.

202
00:14:46,376 --> 00:14:50,418
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, I think it's gonna be a kick ass game, actually.

203
00:14:50,418 --> 00:14:54,460
[SPEAKER_07]: So but it's early so much can change, right?

204
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:57,902
[SPEAKER_07]: So pretty much everything that's been seen out there probably going to change.

205
00:14:58,587 --> 00:15:00,618
[SPEAKER_07]: So, whatever, whatever.

206
00:15:03,075 --> 00:15:11,459
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting though, I will say some voice actor information was also part of the leaks and that information and like who's involved and all that stuff.

207
00:15:11,459 --> 00:15:14,380
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

208
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:16,961
[SPEAKER_07]: I will just say because people are talking about it and spreading it.

209
00:15:16,961 --> 00:15:17,862
[SPEAKER_07]: I just thought it was interesting.

210
00:15:17,862 --> 00:15:20,183
[SPEAKER_07]: Deborah Wilson's in it again.

211
00:15:20,183 --> 00:15:24,005
[SPEAKER_07]: If the leaks are to be believed and things have not changed, etc, etc.

212
00:15:24,005 --> 00:15:28,687
[SPEAKER_07]: If Deborah Wilson's apparently in it again, and I just love her.

213
00:15:30,984 --> 00:15:33,229
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't think of her without thinking about MADtv.

214
00:15:37,461 --> 00:16:05,847
[SPEAKER_07]: and maybe you know and that that could be a bummer because maybe you know again this was something that insomniac wanted to release on their own terms and talk about the voice cast so forth but it does there's plenty of other people too in there that I'm sure they'll announce at some point that didn't catch my eye as much but I was like oh I just love her they they should what with movies you know who's in the movie before they even start shooting why not tell us a little bit about who's on board for the games I don't know all right

215
00:16:07,034 --> 00:16:14,280
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, let's get into our gaming weeks and talk about the types of games that we have been playing this so what's that Jamie?

216
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:21,134
[SPEAKER_01]: excited for when the game comes out because things are looking so positive.

217
00:16:21,134 --> 00:16:24,696
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, if the early build is looking so good.

218
00:16:24,696 --> 00:16:30,941
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I mean, it's honestly I haven't gotten into a lot of the superhero insomniac games.

219
00:16:30,941 --> 00:16:32,062
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not that I'm a hater.

220
00:16:32,062 --> 00:16:33,583
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just the game's backlog.

221
00:16:33,583 --> 00:16:37,466
[SPEAKER_07]: I always mean to play those Spider-Man games because they look incredible.

222
00:16:37,466 --> 00:16:39,628
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, I just never get around to it.

223
00:16:39,628 --> 00:16:41,910
[SPEAKER_07]: So I want to check out Wolverine.

224
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:42,130
[SPEAKER_07]: But

225
00:16:42,881 --> 00:16:45,803
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, gaming backlog, it never ends.

226
00:16:45,803 --> 00:16:52,588
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, let's see what we've been attacking in our gaming backlog this week, if anything, in a segment we call How Was Your Gaming Week?

227
00:16:52,588 --> 00:16:58,912
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll go to DarkSakura and ask How Was Your Gaming Week?

228
00:16:58,912 --> 00:17:01,814
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi Daylight, and Disney Dreamlight Valley.

229
00:17:02,717 --> 00:17:09,125
[SPEAKER_01]: and RudraNulhiho, which I'm on the second scenario now.

230
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:12,289
[SPEAKER_01]: I played some Weird Al pinball, because of course I did.

231
00:17:16,385 --> 00:17:17,966
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd say that's about it.

232
00:17:17,966 --> 00:17:25,132
[SPEAKER_01]: I've actually do you know the I think it's called the watermelon game or something.

233
00:17:25,132 --> 00:17:31,156
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a version for Mac called fruit salad, and I'm going to be giving that a try.

234
00:17:31,156 --> 00:17:33,218
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe today we'll see.

235
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:34,599
[SPEAKER_07]: Mike def says Suica game.

236
00:17:34,599 --> 00:17:37,741
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I've seen Alan play a mobile phone version because you know, like

237
00:17:38,782 --> 00:17:39,183
[SPEAKER_07]: 64 Clones

238
00:17:58,547 --> 00:18:06,450
[SPEAKER_07]: But yes, you know how the popular games clones show up everywhere, especially the one, unfortunately, it's the ones that are easy to clone.

239
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:11,632
[SPEAKER_07]: And I would consider Suika games probably one of those, you know, it's probably not incredibly difficult to clone.

240
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:16,374
[SPEAKER_07]: Flappy Bird's a great example, too.

241
00:18:16,374 --> 00:18:16,874
[SPEAKER_07]: Mm hmm.

242
00:18:16,874 --> 00:18:17,995
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

243
00:18:17,995 --> 00:18:18,655
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

244
00:18:18,655 --> 00:18:21,316
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, well, let's go to Loki.

245
00:18:21,316 --> 00:18:22,377
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, let's go to Loki.

246
00:18:22,377 --> 00:18:23,017
[SPEAKER_07]: How was your gaming week?

247
00:18:24,218 --> 00:18:32,292
[SPEAKER_06]: Is all minecraft for the most part I think I think it played a little bit on the playdate we had a couple I up my

248
00:18:34,664 --> 00:18:37,745
[SPEAKER_06]: where my progress was in the season, so it unlocked more games.

249
00:18:37,745 --> 00:18:40,145
[SPEAKER_06]: So I played Executive Golf, which is kind of fun.

250
00:18:40,145 --> 00:18:50,868
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like a 2D golf game that you have to go up and down floors and knock your golf ball over all this different office furniture and stuff.

251
00:18:50,868 --> 00:18:52,128
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's a little different.

252
00:18:52,128 --> 00:19:01,210
[SPEAKER_06]: I played that, and then there was a time traveler crank game that was kind of hard that I ended up playing as well on the play date.

253
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:03,831
[SPEAKER_06]: But other than that, it's been mostly Minecraft.

254
00:19:03,831 --> 00:19:07,893
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been working on, well, procrastinating a lot.

255
00:19:07,893 --> 00:19:13,136
[SPEAKER_06]: I built a few farms and I muddled a raccoon for the upcoming...

256
00:19:15,165 --> 00:19:16,606
[SPEAKER_06]: theme park ride they're building.

257
00:19:16,606 --> 00:19:21,970
[SPEAKER_06]: So I modeled that in Blockbench for adding some stuff in the game.

258
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:37,580
[SPEAKER_06]: Because the premise of the first ride that I'm doing is supposed to be that you're in a log flume ride and you are going around trying to capture raccoons that have infested a lumber yard.

259
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:38,801
[SPEAKER_06]: Like a lumber mill, I guess.

260
00:19:38,801 --> 00:19:40,182
[SPEAKER_06]: Less of a lumber yard.

261
00:19:40,182 --> 00:19:40,622
[SPEAKER_06]: Lumber mill.

262
00:19:41,462 --> 00:19:45,806
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's all kind of like target shooting type of stuff.

263
00:19:45,806 --> 00:19:55,333
[SPEAKER_06]: And they get captured, but then of course, you know, whatever you capture in game or whatever you shoot at the end, it scores you and then there's going to be like a leaderboard and stuff like that.

264
00:19:56,109 --> 00:20:12,242
[SPEAKER_06]: So it'll be very involved, which is why it's taken so long to get an actual episode out from Channel 64, because I'm still in that mindset of like, I want to finish these big projects in one episode, and it really isn't feasible to do that, and I don't know how to split them up yet.

265
00:20:13,122 --> 00:20:14,764
[SPEAKER_06]: But still kind of early in the planning phase.

266
00:20:14,764 --> 00:20:19,587
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I'll put like an interim episode out kind of discussing that whole planning process.

267
00:20:19,587 --> 00:20:20,468
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that might be good.

268
00:20:20,468 --> 00:20:24,391
[SPEAKER_06]: But I did put out one, the third episode of the Razeworks server.

269
00:20:24,391 --> 00:20:28,134
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I have the fourth one mostly done already.

270
00:20:28,134 --> 00:20:33,958
[SPEAKER_06]: I just need to film a few things and then that'll be out probably next week or so.

271
00:20:33,958 --> 00:20:35,539
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, I've been busy.

272
00:20:35,539 --> 00:20:38,822
[SPEAKER_06]: Just a lot of different stuff in game.

273
00:20:41,026 --> 00:20:54,753
[SPEAKER_07]: MikeyMuWeek has been a little bit of a hodgepodge of different stuff, still playing Diablo 4, still playing World of Warcraft Season of Discovery, although I think I might have about hit my limit there on Season of Discovery, because now I'm like, I'm not really interested in raiding.

274
00:20:54,753 --> 00:21:03,497
[SPEAKER_07]: I joined an LGBTQIA guild that was shouting in trade chat in the game, and they're all like, but I forgot about how much I don't enjoy the whole like,

275
00:21:04,297 --> 00:21:13,765
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're great, don't get me wrong, but it's the whole, like, we gotta get a group together for Saturday, and it's gonna be at this time, server time, we gotta prepare all the potions and all this stuff, and I'm just like, eh, that's the part I don't miss.

276
00:21:13,765 --> 00:21:27,135
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't need to do the organized raiding, because I just, I don't, I, maybe it's because I'm older, I just don't like to commit that kind of time to that sort of stuff, so, but I like, I like signing in, but I just kind of feel like I'm running out of things to do now with level cap, because I'm not interested in raiding.

277
00:21:27,135 --> 00:21:31,599
[SPEAKER_07]: There's, there's doing alts, and that's about it, and even alt stuff is kind of getting old.

278
00:21:32,119 --> 00:21:39,683
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's also one of those things where I think the break has been good because now I'm like, oh, I really need to go back and finish where I was in Final Fantasy XIV.

279
00:21:39,683 --> 00:21:46,626
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think it's been like a little bit of a palate cleanser going back to WoW and kind of like, you know, remembering the game I played a long time ago.

280
00:21:46,626 --> 00:21:53,830
[SPEAKER_07]: And now it's like, OK, now I need to go back and during this kind of lull in Final Fantasy XIV, go back and finish the content I hadn't done yet.

281
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:56,371
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I kind of have a taste for it again after doing other stuff.

282
00:21:56,371 --> 00:21:57,431
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll see.

283
00:21:58,672 --> 00:21:59,453
[SPEAKER_07]: Fortnite Fortnite Festival

284
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:45,669
[SPEAKER_07]: uh another song so there's there's these interesting like new songs are showing up on thursday so i wonder if they aren't at injecting more stuff into the rotation every thursday to try to give this some longevity uh we'll see but um i still think 500 v bucks is a disgusting price to charge for the songs there's no fucking way i'm gonna pay it so if the song's not in the free rotation or a giveaway there was a really silly epic original song about winter

285
00:22:46,874 --> 00:22:48,195
[SPEAKER_07]: WinterWonderFest

286
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:11,135
[SPEAKER_07]: YouTube channel, however, is a unique name because my Rob Roberts was taken already.

287
00:23:11,135 --> 00:23:14,980
[SPEAKER_07]: Unfortunately, there's a few people in media who use the same name.

288
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:19,485
[SPEAKER_07]: So Rob Roberts Plays, P-L-A-Y-S is my YouTube channel, Rob Roberts Plays.

289
00:23:21,306 --> 00:23:25,050
[SPEAKER_07]: I did also play a little more Lego Fortnite as well, that's still fun.

290
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:28,814
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, I'm happy that there's more games than just Battle Royale.

291
00:23:28,814 --> 00:23:31,076
[SPEAKER_07]: But I've been playing other stuff too that's not that.

292
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:32,357
[SPEAKER_07]: This is gonna be so random.

293
00:23:32,357 --> 00:23:33,478
[SPEAKER_07]: Y'all are gonna be like, what the fuck?

294
00:23:33,478 --> 00:23:35,040
[SPEAKER_07]: Why did Rob start playing that?

295
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,783
[SPEAKER_07]: I played a game called Remnant 2.

296
00:23:37,783 --> 00:23:38,583
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what this game is?

297
00:23:39,482 --> 00:23:44,385
[SPEAKER_07]: There was a game called Remnant from the Ashes, and then Remnant 2 just came out over the summer.

298
00:23:44,385 --> 00:23:51,288
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it's on Game Pass, and a friend of mine, same friend that likes to play Overwatch with me, was like, you should get this game, Rob.

299
00:23:51,288 --> 00:23:53,029
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like Diablo, but it's like a shooter.

300
00:23:53,029 --> 00:23:54,770
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was like, OK, you had me at Diablo.

301
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:56,131
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to check it out.

302
00:23:56,131 --> 00:23:59,773
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, the party left out was that it's like Dark Souls meets Diablo.

303
00:24:01,491 --> 00:24:01,911
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura

304
00:24:20,996 --> 00:24:37,180
[SPEAKER_07]: You could change the classes on demand a little more easy because now I'm going to have to play the intro segment again, in order to switch to like a medic, which might be a good idea because then I'd have a ton of heals or a gunner so I could I assume assume hit people more long distance, because right now I'm a

305
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:41,521
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, but the equivalent of a warrior.

306
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:47,724
[SPEAKER_07]: I basically, I have a tin can on my head and a giant sword and I slash at people but they down me in like one hit.

307
00:24:47,724 --> 00:24:52,887
[SPEAKER_07]: And even though I was trying to play myself on what is supposedly Bobby Blackwolf mode, uh-uh.

308
00:24:52,887 --> 00:24:55,628
[SPEAKER_07]: This is still like a Dark Souls kind of game.

309
00:24:55,628 --> 00:24:57,189
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah, I don't know.

310
00:24:57,189 --> 00:24:57,629
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see.

311
00:24:57,629 --> 00:25:02,572
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm gonna give it another try but I'm just feeling this game might be too difficult for me and that's okay.

312
00:25:02,572 --> 00:25:02,812
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean...

313
00:25:03,812 --> 00:25:08,436
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not usually a fan of the souls kind of games, but my husband loves that stuff.

314
00:25:08,436 --> 00:25:10,157
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, there's an audience for it.

315
00:25:10,157 --> 00:25:11,719
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see.

316
00:25:11,719 --> 00:25:16,302
[SPEAKER_07]: Waynein12 in chat, hi, thanks for listening, says, I played the first Remnant.

317
00:25:16,302 --> 00:25:19,585
[SPEAKER_07]: It became very frustrating, especially the bosses and their adds.

318
00:25:19,585 --> 00:25:21,486
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's not an easy game.

319
00:25:21,486 --> 00:25:22,127
[SPEAKER_07]: But you know what?

320
00:25:22,127 --> 00:25:26,751
[SPEAKER_07]: Some people love that bang their head on the wall kind of difficulty.

321
00:25:26,751 --> 00:25:28,072
[SPEAKER_07]: And so like this,

322
00:25:29,281 --> 00:25:36,944
[SPEAKER_07]: Taking that and mixing it with procedural generation, I understand why somebody told me, like, you should try playing this game, and why there's an audience for it.

323
00:25:36,944 --> 00:25:42,647
[SPEAKER_07]: And I can totally recognize sometimes, there is an audience for this game, that audience is not me.

324
00:25:42,647 --> 00:25:44,347
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like movies, sometimes.

325
00:25:44,347 --> 00:25:47,369
[SPEAKER_07]: There is an audience for Terrifier 2.

326
00:25:47,369 --> 00:25:49,990
[SPEAKER_07]: That audience is not me.

327
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:50,730
[SPEAKER_07]: It's that simple.

328
00:25:53,604 --> 00:25:58,667
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see, but I also played, this is very random, but I was like, you know what?

329
00:25:58,667 --> 00:26:01,649
[SPEAKER_07]: I bought those Final Fantasy Pixel remasters.

330
00:26:01,649 --> 00:26:05,691
[SPEAKER_07]: I got a platinum trophy on Final Fantasy 1, I actually streamed that whole thing.

331
00:26:05,691 --> 00:26:09,313
[SPEAKER_07]: But I never played any other Final Fantasy game after that, and I was like, I gotta fix this.

332
00:26:09,313 --> 00:26:10,554
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what my hang-up has been?

333
00:26:11,414 --> 00:26:13,374
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want to play Final Fantasy 2.

334
00:26:13,374 --> 00:26:17,675
[SPEAKER_07]: I just, like, Final Fantasy 2 is, like, pretty much the worst Final Fantasy game.

335
00:26:17,675 --> 00:26:33,619
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't, y'all know I don't like 8 either, but Final Fantasy 2, it, I, people want to fight me over Final Fantasy 8, but if I were to sit here and say Final Fantasy 2, and remember, this is Japanese NES 2, if I were to say Final Fantasy 2 is the worst Final Fantasy game,

336
00:26:34,099 --> 00:26:36,224
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think a lot of people would pick a fight.

337
00:26:36,224 --> 00:26:40,032
[SPEAKER_07]: I think most people would say, yeah, that game's in the bottom three, at least.

338
00:26:40,032 --> 00:26:43,018
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, Final Fantasy II is kind of the worst one.

339
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:43,860
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't even remember II.

340
00:26:45,003 --> 00:26:46,444
[SPEAKER_01]: It had challenges.

341
00:26:46,444 --> 00:26:47,705
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it will.

342
00:26:47,705 --> 00:26:49,546
[SPEAKER_01]: It had challenges.

343
00:26:49,546 --> 00:26:51,168
[SPEAKER_01]: Three was awesome, though.

344
00:26:51,168 --> 00:26:53,670
[SPEAKER_07]: It was the same reason I don't care for eight.

345
00:26:53,670 --> 00:26:55,631
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of a broken system.

346
00:26:55,631 --> 00:26:56,632
[SPEAKER_07]: For me, it's broken.

347
00:26:56,632 --> 00:27:02,516
[SPEAKER_07]: And what I mean by that is that it's the whole leveling up through taking damage and using things over and over again.

348
00:27:02,516 --> 00:27:04,137
[SPEAKER_07]: I think they took some of that idea.

349
00:27:04,137 --> 00:27:09,722
[SPEAKER_07]: And funny enough, 11 institutes a lot of that same skill up sort of concept, but it's much better in 11.

350
00:27:10,402 --> 00:27:11,083
[SPEAKER_07]: in my opinion.

351
00:27:11,083 --> 00:27:13,926
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, it's just, you know, I'll go play it someday.

352
00:27:13,926 --> 00:27:20,232
[SPEAKER_07]: But Jamie, funny enough, since you bring that up, I said, you know what, why am I sitting here going, you must play Final Fantasy 2?

353
00:27:20,232 --> 00:27:21,334
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck that noise.

354
00:27:21,334 --> 00:27:22,355
[SPEAKER_07]: I make the rules.

355
00:27:22,355 --> 00:27:23,196
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Christmas.

356
00:27:23,196 --> 00:27:24,377
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm gonna do what I want.

357
00:27:24,377 --> 00:27:27,520
[SPEAKER_07]: So I played Final Fantasy 3 NES.

358
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,243
[SPEAKER_07]: And I will fully admit, I've used- Which he knows is one of my favorites.

359
00:27:30,243 --> 00:27:31,104
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and actually, and

360
00:27:32,265 --> 00:27:34,507
[SPEAKER_07]: Admittedly, I've only played a little bit of it.

361
00:27:34,507 --> 00:27:41,832
[SPEAKER_07]: I played, I always call it the OUYA version, but it was actually the DS version, the one that went 3D, but you know, it was on the OUYA.

362
00:27:41,832 --> 00:27:46,196
[SPEAKER_07]: I played a little bit of that, but not enough.

363
00:27:46,196 --> 00:27:50,239
[SPEAKER_07]: But this one, I'm already further in this one than I ever got in the OUYA version of Final Fantasy III.

364
00:27:51,139 --> 00:28:15,984
[SPEAKER_07]: um and so i'm up to i think i'm about to go get the fire crystal finally which it actually takes quite some time in that game to get through a sequence of events before you're about to go get the next crystal which unlocks new jobs which is a big part of that game but i will also fully admit i'm using a guide to help me get a platinum trophy and it's basically a guide that just says don't miss this treasure chest make sure you get these beastiary things because

365
00:28:16,744 --> 00:28:21,348
[SPEAKER_07]: There are certain bestiary things where if you don't get them, you won't get the Platinum Trophy.

366
00:28:21,348 --> 00:28:25,713
[SPEAKER_07]: Like one of them is like this water dragon that's blocking a channel.

367
00:28:25,713 --> 00:28:40,867
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't have to beat him, in fact you really can't, but you have to encounter him and run to get the bestiary, and if you don't do that before you clear the level that then gets rid of him so you can get through in the water channel, you're fucked for a Platinum Trophy.

368
00:28:41,147 --> 00:28:42,868
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm using a guide for that reason.

369
00:28:42,868 --> 00:28:45,889
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't have to go back and play it over and over again.

370
00:28:45,889 --> 00:28:48,570
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, but I'm enjoying Fallout Fantasy 3.

371
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:49,830
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, I know you love it.

372
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:52,351
[SPEAKER_07]: But I want it after after I'm done with it.

373
00:28:52,351 --> 00:28:56,872
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm saying that there's no problem with having to use a guide.

374
00:28:56,872 --> 00:28:57,693
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah, no, no.

375
00:28:57,693 --> 00:29:04,275
[SPEAKER_07]: I Yeah, yeah, we were just talking about this on the Bobby show a little bit is that especially in the NES era, like

376
00:29:05,405 --> 00:29:06,925
[SPEAKER_07]: We had manuals.

377
00:29:06,925 --> 00:29:08,426
[SPEAKER_07]: We had guides.

378
00:29:08,426 --> 00:29:09,626
[SPEAKER_07]: We had things to help us.

379
00:29:09,626 --> 00:29:11,526
[SPEAKER_01]: We also did have printed user guides.

380
00:29:11,526 --> 00:29:12,086
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

381
00:29:12,086 --> 00:29:12,406
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.

382
00:29:12,406 --> 00:29:12,706
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

383
00:29:12,706 --> 00:29:15,287
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we had Nintendo Fun Club and Nintendo Power.

384
00:29:15,287 --> 00:29:30,349
[SPEAKER_07]: That's how we had a Zelda map, because people today, we were just talking about this on Bobby Show, but, you know, kids today or people who just, you know, don't know for whatever reason, don't realize that like when they say, well, in The Legend of Zelda, you just had to figure out what to do.

385
00:29:30,349 --> 00:29:31,710
[SPEAKER_07]: You just got dropped in there.

386
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:32,770
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, gosh, she did.

387
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:33,030
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

388
00:29:34,050 --> 00:29:41,936
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a 900 number that we could call to ask people at Nintendo to rank up our grandmother's bills.

389
00:29:41,936 --> 00:29:47,679
[SPEAKER_07]: Read the last 10 pages of the manual because it walks you through like the first three levels of Zelda.

390
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:49,901
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's right there.

391
00:29:49,901 --> 00:29:51,462
[SPEAKER_07]: If you need to figure out... You know what?

392
00:29:51,462 --> 00:29:54,544
[SPEAKER_01]: If we had the internet then, we would have totally used it.

393
00:29:54,544 --> 00:29:55,464
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.

394
00:29:55,464 --> 00:29:56,045
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.

395
00:29:56,565 --> 00:30:00,368
[SPEAKER_07]: So anyway, I am playing Final Fantasy III, and I am enjoying it.

396
00:30:00,368 --> 00:30:01,468
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm using the boosts.

397
00:30:01,468 --> 00:30:02,529
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't care.

398
00:30:02,529 --> 00:30:04,771
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm having fun.

399
00:30:04,771 --> 00:30:15,238
[SPEAKER_07]: You actually really do have to think about, like, okay, if I use a red mage, so I have warrior, monk, red mage, white mage, because keep in mind, I only have the base jobs right now.

400
00:30:15,238 --> 00:30:17,639
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just before I get the second set of jobs.

401
00:30:17,639 --> 00:30:24,884
[SPEAKER_07]: So I went for red mage instead of black mage, which I think is actually easier in the beginning, because, you know, you get a little bit of the oomph there.

402
00:30:24,884 --> 00:30:25,205
[SPEAKER_07]: But

403
00:30:25,905 --> 00:30:35,074
[SPEAKER_07]: There is actually some really challenging shit because you have, in the beginning of the game, because you have done, I actually understand why they didn't bring this out in America now.

404
00:30:35,074 --> 00:30:40,900
[SPEAKER_07]: Now that I'm really sitting down and playing this in depth, I'm like, oh, oh, people would have never figured out.

405
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:51,987
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to cast mini on your whole party to find the town and then go through the dungeon as mini, which means you can only cast spells you can't fight.

406
00:30:51,987 --> 00:31:02,514
[SPEAKER_07]: So you ought to think about switching your entire party to black mages before you, well, three black mages and a white mage before you go mini so that you have the firepower and then you have to mix up your spells.

407
00:31:02,514 --> 00:31:05,957
[SPEAKER_07]: There's actually a lot of fun logic puzzles in a way to think about with it.

408
00:31:05,957 --> 00:31:06,117
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

409
00:31:08,078 --> 00:31:15,585
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also stuff like that in Final Fantasy V, which also didn't get released originally in the US.

410
00:31:15,585 --> 00:31:26,215
[SPEAKER_01]: There's the whole point that you have to do that for reaching certain elvish creatures and then you've got to do other puzzles similar to that in the Moogle Village and yeah.

411
00:31:27,642 --> 00:31:31,664
[SPEAKER_07]: And then Final Fantasy 4 literally dumbed down for America.

412
00:31:31,664 --> 00:31:39,528
[SPEAKER_07]: Which I'm sure most people know that at this point, but we actually had what they ended up re-releasing in Japan as Final Fantasy 4 Easy Type.

413
00:31:39,528 --> 00:31:43,269
[SPEAKER_07]: Is the actual Final Fantasy 2 US.

414
00:31:43,269 --> 00:31:48,372
[SPEAKER_01]: So, because they um... I played through the original on my channel, remember?

415
00:31:48,652 --> 00:31:49,252
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I do.

416
00:31:49,252 --> 00:31:49,513
[SPEAKER_07]: I do.

417
00:31:49,513 --> 00:31:54,316
[SPEAKER_07]: It's and it's, yeah, and well, and now the pixel remasters and all that they emulate the original.

418
00:31:54,316 --> 00:32:00,159
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't, you know, Easy Type is just a Ted Woosley memory in our heart, apparently at this point.

419
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:04,162
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's, it's, uh, and all the translation issues.

420
00:32:04,162 --> 00:32:05,823
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, yes.

421
00:32:05,823 --> 00:32:10,186
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of that, though, not all of that is the translator.

422
00:32:10,186 --> 00:32:15,269
[SPEAKER_07]: Because like things like the Holy Spell being renamed, that wasn't it called White?

423
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,341
[SPEAKER_07]: in the original.

424
00:32:18,341 --> 00:32:20,322
[SPEAKER_07]: Pearl, maybe, was what they called it.

425
00:32:20,322 --> 00:32:25,225
[SPEAKER_07]: But they had to change the name because you couldn't say holy in a Nintendo game.

426
00:32:25,225 --> 00:32:28,167
[SPEAKER_07]: That was unholy to say holy.

427
00:32:28,167 --> 00:32:28,387
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway.

428
00:32:30,577 --> 00:32:34,681
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, Final Fantasy tangent, but I'm enjoying three the pixel remaster.

429
00:32:34,681 --> 00:32:48,912
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you are where I'm at, and you are saying, I want to be all of the pixel remasters, and I played one, I don't want to play two, I want to give you permission to do what I did and give your let yourself give yourself a just skip to just skip it.

430
00:32:48,912 --> 00:32:50,314
[SPEAKER_07]: You can always come back to it later.

431
00:32:50,834 --> 00:32:55,737
[SPEAKER_07]: just skip it, enjoy three, enjoy four, five, six, and then there you go.

432
00:32:55,737 --> 00:32:57,358
[SPEAKER_07]: That's so that's my plan.

433
00:32:57,358 --> 00:33:00,961
[SPEAKER_07]: I will probably stream four and not use a guide.

434
00:33:00,961 --> 00:33:07,765
[SPEAKER_07]: Because four is one where it's like if I have to play that a second time to get everything I actually don't care as much.

435
00:33:07,765 --> 00:33:12,428
[SPEAKER_07]: So four and six I'll probably stream because I could play those forever.

436
00:33:12,428 --> 00:33:13,909
[SPEAKER_07]: I like three and five though.

437
00:33:13,909 --> 00:33:17,191
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I don't I don't know why I played through five.

438
00:33:17,191 --> 00:33:19,953
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, well, I don't think I actually beat it.

439
00:33:21,758 --> 00:33:23,638
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I got like very very far.

440
00:33:53,075 --> 00:33:54,556
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, and I'll throw this out there.

441
00:33:54,556 --> 00:33:59,339
[SPEAKER_01]: You might actually super enjoy Rura no Hiho.

442
00:33:59,339 --> 00:34:01,640
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a translation of it.

443
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,281
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really fun.

444
00:34:03,281 --> 00:34:05,062
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it would be right up your alley.

445
00:34:06,449 --> 00:34:16,078
[SPEAKER_07]: I wonder if Square Enix might think about that as a re-release later in the same style as Live Alive.

446
00:34:16,078 --> 00:34:17,279
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you play through Live Alive?

447
00:34:17,279 --> 00:34:21,663
[SPEAKER_07]: No, but I want to get the redone one.

448
00:34:21,663 --> 00:34:26,007
[SPEAKER_01]: Live Alive is... I want the redone version and Seiken 3.

449
00:34:26,007 --> 00:34:27,529
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

450
00:34:27,529 --> 00:34:28,129
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

451
00:34:30,091 --> 00:34:35,457
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are, I'm so glad I played those because they were so much fun.

452
00:34:35,457 --> 00:34:43,046
[SPEAKER_01]: Although I'm pretty much going to be going back to, I think I'm going to do either Star Ocean original or Emerald Dragon next.

453
00:34:43,046 --> 00:34:44,127
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't decided.

454
00:34:44,127 --> 00:34:47,832
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm loving this Square Enix going back and bringing out like the

455
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:55,034
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm using my quotey fingers, obscure to us JRPGs now in this new engine that they've been doing in the past couple years.

456
00:34:55,034 --> 00:35:04,637
[SPEAKER_07]: I think ever since they realized they could use the engine they made for, you know, Octopath Traveler and Triangle Strategy and all this stuff, like they can use that engine to remake old games too.

457
00:35:04,637 --> 00:35:05,898
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's great.

458
00:35:05,898 --> 00:35:09,359
[SPEAKER_07]: So I hope they keep it going and bring us other games.

459
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:09,619
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see.

460
00:35:11,713 --> 00:35:18,215
[SPEAKER_01]: I really, I would, I would petition them to bring Rudran Elhiho out.

461
00:35:18,215 --> 00:35:23,337
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially with the such unique magic system in there.

462
00:35:23,337 --> 00:35:26,457
[SPEAKER_01]: With the, with the mantras and all that.

463
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:29,798
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, they might be working on Chrono Trigger though.

464
00:35:29,798 --> 00:35:35,260
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the popular rumor is that they're finally going to give us what we fucking want and give us Chrono Trigger in that engine.

465
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:37,501
[SPEAKER_01]: How many more endings are they going to add to it?

466
00:35:37,501 --> 00:35:41,082
[SPEAKER_07]: Ooh, that's actually, that's legit, legit a good question.

467
00:35:42,261 --> 00:35:44,942
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, with the PlayStation ones, they added more endings.

468
00:35:44,942 --> 00:35:46,382
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we should get more endings.

469
00:35:46,382 --> 00:35:53,603
[SPEAKER_01]: Dan and I have played through eight of the endings together, nine, something like that.

470
00:35:53,603 --> 00:35:54,703
[SPEAKER_01]: We did a bunch of them.

471
00:35:54,703 --> 00:35:56,104
[SPEAKER_07]: I want a dog ending.

472
00:35:56,104 --> 00:35:57,064
[SPEAKER_07]: That'd be great.

473
00:35:57,064 --> 00:36:02,345
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I want a Wayne's... Woof, woof, woof, woof, woof, woof, woof, woof, woof, woof, woof.

474
00:36:02,345 --> 00:36:08,986
[SPEAKER_07]: I want a Wayne's World mega happy ending as well.

475
00:36:08,986 --> 00:36:09,186
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

476
00:36:10,026 --> 00:36:11,267
[SPEAKER_01]: I love you, Goth.

477
00:36:11,267 --> 00:36:15,309
[SPEAKER_01]: I love you, Dream Woman.

478
00:36:15,309 --> 00:36:16,290
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to watch that again.

479
00:36:16,290 --> 00:36:16,630
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.

480
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:17,711
[SPEAKER_07]: I need to watch Wayne's World.

481
00:36:17,711 --> 00:36:19,752
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to say and Wayne's World 2, but not really.

482
00:36:19,752 --> 00:36:21,753
[SPEAKER_07]: Wayne's World 2 was not nearly as good.

483
00:36:21,753 --> 00:36:23,955
[SPEAKER_07]: So even if I had Christopher Walken.

484
00:36:23,955 --> 00:36:24,635
[SPEAKER_01]: Moments.

485
00:36:24,635 --> 00:36:27,777
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, Wayne's World was.

486
00:36:27,777 --> 00:36:29,818
[SPEAKER_07]: Peak 90s cinema.

487
00:36:29,818 --> 00:36:32,720
[SPEAKER_07]: Peak 90s cinema.

488
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:33,341
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway.

489
00:36:33,341 --> 00:36:34,021
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

490
00:36:34,021 --> 00:36:34,721
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

491
00:36:34,721 --> 00:36:36,342
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, you know, my other favorite 90s movie.

492
00:36:37,711 --> 00:36:40,732
[SPEAKER_01]: which is completely on a different direction as pump up the volume.

493
00:36:40,732 --> 00:36:44,093
[SPEAKER_01]: Showgirls.

494
00:36:44,093 --> 00:36:45,714
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't know shit.

495
00:36:45,714 --> 00:36:47,655
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

496
00:36:47,655 --> 00:36:48,495
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's move on.

497
00:36:48,495 --> 00:36:52,357
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the last time I saw that was at the Peaches Christ Midnight Mass.

498
00:36:52,357 --> 00:36:53,077
[SPEAKER_07]: That was a while ago.

499
00:36:53,077 --> 00:36:57,038
[SPEAKER_07]: She ended that a while ago, but I think that was last time I saw it, too, to be honest.

500
00:36:57,038 --> 00:37:01,160
[SPEAKER_07]: We watched it at your house one one.

501
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:06,382
[SPEAKER_07]: Didn't we watch it at your house one Christmas with, you know, the girl we don't hang out with anymore?

502
00:37:06,382 --> 00:37:06,602
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

503
00:37:08,502 --> 00:37:10,242
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, yeah, yeah.

504
00:37:10,242 --> 00:37:11,683
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like that was the last time I saw it.

505
00:37:11,683 --> 00:37:12,783
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, her.

506
00:37:12,783 --> 00:37:14,183
[SPEAKER_07]: So anyway.

507
00:37:14,183 --> 00:37:14,883
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

508
00:37:14,883 --> 00:37:15,924
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

509
00:37:15,924 --> 00:37:17,844
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's get into some gaming news.

510
00:37:17,844 --> 00:37:21,145
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh God, no Skitsaberry.

511
00:37:21,145 --> 00:37:23,125
[SPEAKER_07]: Pump up the show, girl.

512
00:37:23,125 --> 00:37:26,186
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's talk about some of the other things that have been going on in gaming this week.

513
00:37:26,186 --> 00:37:35,688
[SPEAKER_07]: Not that there's a ton of stuff, but there's still a few things here and there, such as what ought to happen to these leakers and folks that release information early, right?

514
00:37:35,688 --> 00:37:36,828
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, accountability.

515
00:37:37,208 --> 00:37:39,429
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, yeah, accountability.

516
00:37:39,429 --> 00:37:46,533
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't necessarily agree with the life sentence, but apparently the hacker.

517
00:37:46,533 --> 00:37:48,974
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I understand the reasoning for it.

518
00:37:48,974 --> 00:38:04,283
[SPEAKER_06]: So like basically the hacker that was responsible for the Grand Theft Auto 6 leak, which was only 18, basically has been he's been sentenced to life in a hospital prison.

519
00:38:05,645 --> 00:38:10,530
[SPEAKER_06]: and can only be released if Dr. Society is no longer a danger to others.

520
00:38:10,530 --> 00:38:19,679
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably because the guy that was sentenced to that said that as soon as I get out, I'm going to do this again and again and again and again.

521
00:38:19,679 --> 00:38:22,622
[SPEAKER_06]: So they're like, well, you can't.

522
00:38:25,274 --> 00:38:32,957
[SPEAKER_06]: Continue to express the intent to return to cybercrime as soon as possible, calling him highly motivated.

523
00:38:32,957 --> 00:38:38,900
[SPEAKER_06]: Also claimed that he was violent while held in custody for the trial.

524
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:41,481
[SPEAKER_06]: So he's got mental issues, probably.

525
00:38:43,396 --> 00:38:57,219
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, I hope that this is appropriate for the crime and not because Rockstar Games is a big company and so they pressured the court systems to make an example of this person type of thing.

526
00:38:57,219 --> 00:39:01,280
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, him admitting some of those things is not a great look either.

527
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:04,301
[SPEAKER_07]: Like if you literally say, don't let me out of here, I'll do it again.

528
00:39:06,188 --> 00:39:06,428
[SPEAKER_07]: and Matt.

529
00:39:23,516 --> 00:39:36,901
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, well, I wonder though, maybe I've watched too many Netflix shows, but do you think this guy knows the people that just did the insomniac thing?

530
00:39:37,827 --> 00:39:43,152
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you think that this guy could like rat on the Insomniac people?

531
00:39:43,152 --> 00:39:44,974
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I don't think so.

532
00:39:44,974 --> 00:39:48,157
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I guess I watch too much TV dramas.

533
00:39:48,157 --> 00:39:49,798
[SPEAKER_06]: The hackers don't all know each other.

534
00:39:49,798 --> 00:39:51,760
[SPEAKER_06]: This isn't like a big hacking network.

535
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:57,986
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, they have individual like groups, but they're not all like, hey, welcome to hack.

536
00:39:57,986 --> 00:39:59,468
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I guess they do have hacker cons.

537
00:40:01,469 --> 00:40:02,791
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for watching!

538
00:40:21,810 --> 00:40:22,991
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I don't think that they have it.

539
00:40:22,991 --> 00:40:29,715
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, Bobby Blackoaf also points out, and this is just so, you know, any person that attends these cons listenings understands, we do get it.

540
00:40:29,715 --> 00:40:34,137
[SPEAKER_07]: Bobby Blackoaf points out DEF CON is like a white hat hacker con.

541
00:40:34,137 --> 00:40:34,377
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

542
00:40:34,377 --> 00:40:36,419
[SPEAKER_07]: There are no black hat hacker cons.

543
00:40:36,419 --> 00:40:43,863
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course, white hat means hacking for good, security prevention or, you know, those those sorts of things, not security.

544
00:40:43,863 --> 00:40:44,883
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I mean?

545
00:40:44,883 --> 00:40:45,784
[SPEAKER_07]: Or a challenge.

546
00:40:45,784 --> 00:40:46,564
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.

547
00:40:46,564 --> 00:40:48,886
[SPEAKER_07]: Or for fun, but not hurting anybody.

548
00:40:49,546 --> 00:40:55,610
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, when someone says that their console is unhackable and then- Putting Linux on a toaster.

549
00:40:55,610 --> 00:40:58,952
[SPEAKER_06]: That doesn't prevent people from, you know, figuring out how to do that stuff.

550
00:40:58,952 --> 00:41:01,293
[SPEAKER_07]: What have I started?

551
00:41:01,293 --> 00:41:02,594
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

552
00:41:02,594 --> 00:41:03,894
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow.

553
00:41:03,894 --> 00:41:07,296
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I hear all this talk about putting Linux on a toaster.

554
00:41:07,296 --> 00:41:09,337
[SPEAKER_06]: Why not Linux on toast?

555
00:41:09,337 --> 00:41:10,978
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been waiting for that.

556
00:41:10,978 --> 00:41:12,359
[SPEAKER_06]: Come on.

557
00:41:12,359 --> 00:41:13,320
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe at next year's DevCon.

558
00:41:15,427 --> 00:41:20,892
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, don't they have like those little toaster printer things that you could do like Hello Kitty or something?

559
00:41:20,892 --> 00:41:22,093
[SPEAKER_01]: Just put the penguin on it.

560
00:41:22,093 --> 00:41:23,735
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

561
00:41:23,735 --> 00:41:27,058
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have the Linux logo on toast.

562
00:41:27,058 --> 00:41:29,981
[SPEAKER_07]: One step closer.

563
00:41:29,981 --> 00:41:35,906
[SPEAKER_07]: It's basically the equivalent of when computers ran on punch cards, except the punch card is a piece of bread.

564
00:41:35,906 --> 00:41:37,788
[SPEAKER_07]: That's that's where we're moving to.

565
00:41:37,788 --> 00:41:39,569
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a story about punch cards, Rob.

566
00:41:39,569 --> 00:41:40,450
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, why not?

567
00:41:40,450 --> 00:41:41,091
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the holidays.

568
00:41:42,958 --> 00:41:57,041
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my friends was a Fortran programmer in the 70s and had a bunch of punch cards left over from, you know, programming stuff and turned them into lampshades.

569
00:41:57,041 --> 00:41:57,741
[SPEAKER_06]: I can see that.

570
00:41:57,741 --> 00:41:58,241
[SPEAKER_06]: I can see that.

571
00:41:58,241 --> 00:41:59,101
[SPEAKER_06]: That's fun.

572
00:41:59,101 --> 00:42:03,562
[SPEAKER_01]: Laminated them and made them into lampshades.

573
00:42:03,562 --> 00:42:04,563
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what, though?

574
00:42:04,563 --> 00:42:05,003
[SPEAKER_07]: That's art.

575
00:42:05,003 --> 00:42:06,323
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the same person that also

576
00:42:08,122 --> 00:42:08,703
[SPEAKER_07]: That's art.

577
00:42:08,703 --> 00:42:09,603
[SPEAKER_07]: People would pay money for that.

578
00:42:09,603 --> 00:42:17,068
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the same person that also took the 11 inch floppies and made storage containers out of them.

579
00:42:17,068 --> 00:42:18,429
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just, it's recycling.

580
00:42:18,429 --> 00:42:20,951
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, floppies came that big, kids.

581
00:42:20,951 --> 00:42:21,912
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just recycling.

582
00:42:21,912 --> 00:42:23,833
[SPEAKER_01]: Floppies were the size of your head.

583
00:42:25,828 --> 00:42:27,068
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

584
00:42:27,068 --> 00:42:32,810
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, anyway, let's move on and talk about Oh, a really feel good story for the holidays.

585
00:42:32,810 --> 00:42:36,310
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, since you know, we are taping this show on Christmas Eve.

586
00:42:36,310 --> 00:42:46,573
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, Merry Christmas, Merry whatever you celebrate, because we just got news that Bobby Kotick will be leaving Activision Blizzard two days earlier than expected.

587
00:42:46,573 --> 00:42:53,475
[SPEAKER_07]: And so by the time you know what, this is the last Orange Lounge Radio, where Bobby Kotick is in the gaming industry.

588
00:42:53,475 --> 00:42:54,695
[SPEAKER_07]: And doesn't that feel good, y'all?

589
00:42:55,475 --> 00:42:59,117
[SPEAKER_07]: because Bobby Kotick will be a thing of the past after December 29th.

590
00:42:59,117 --> 00:43:08,182
[SPEAKER_07]: He has been a toxic person in this industry for 32 years and to which we say, don't let the door hit you in the big fat ass on the way out.

591
00:43:08,182 --> 00:43:10,383
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so goodbye.

592
00:43:10,383 --> 00:43:10,984
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

593
00:43:12,284 --> 00:43:12,845
[SPEAKER_07]: December 29, 2023

594
00:43:30,509 --> 00:43:32,850
[SPEAKER_07]: Go back to last week's show if you would like to listen to that.

595
00:43:32,850 --> 00:43:39,655
[SPEAKER_07]: We all know it's not going to happen, but I can still wish, I can still wish upon a star because it is that season.

596
00:43:39,655 --> 00:43:46,639
[SPEAKER_07]: They are letting folks know at Activision though, with the departure, they're letting people know about some other people that are leaving as well.

597
00:43:46,639 --> 00:43:53,423
[SPEAKER_07]: And then for most folks, and they say in this email from Phil Spencer to Activision, your day-to-day work will remain the same.

598
00:43:53,423 --> 00:43:57,946
[SPEAKER_07]: It's still business as usual in bringing more groundbreaking experiences to more players around the world.

599
00:43:58,386 --> 00:44:11,471
[SPEAKER_07]: At the leadership level, these changes will provide the clarity and accountability that is necessary to achieve our ambitious goals and foster a culture that is welcoming, empowering, and committed to gaming for everyone.

600
00:44:11,471 --> 00:44:13,672
[SPEAKER_07]: I am your God now, Phil Spencer.

601
00:44:15,001 --> 00:44:15,662
[SPEAKER_07]: and Bobby Kotick.

602
00:44:36,905 --> 00:44:49,215
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm assuming that Bobby Kotick is getting out of the industry two days early because he needs that extra time to flee the country after the news has come out that, you know, whose lists are going to be released by the government in January.

603
00:44:49,215 --> 00:44:52,798
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, if if.

604
00:44:52,798 --> 00:45:00,163
[SPEAKER_07]: Allegedly, if a person's name was maybe too in tied with those lists.

605
00:45:00,163 --> 00:45:04,847
[SPEAKER_07]: I might want to be really far away when that comes out.

606
00:45:07,479 --> 00:45:08,479
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.

607
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:13,580
[SPEAKER_01]: So Sia Tabiri says insert toxic violin stinger here.

608
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:18,101
[SPEAKER_01]: I can raise that one level.

609
00:45:18,101 --> 00:45:20,242
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, it's cutting in and out, but I could.

610
00:45:20,242 --> 00:45:20,602
[SPEAKER_07]: I heard.

611
00:45:20,602 --> 00:45:21,182
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, sorry.

612
00:45:21,182 --> 00:45:22,142
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the shade.

613
00:45:22,142 --> 00:45:23,763
[SPEAKER_07]: I could hear just part of the shade.

614
00:45:23,763 --> 00:45:24,743
[SPEAKER_07]: Shade rattle in there.

615
00:45:24,743 --> 00:45:26,283
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

616
00:45:26,283 --> 00:45:30,684
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that that that I think is is appropriate.

617
00:45:30,684 --> 00:45:32,144
[SPEAKER_01]: So.

618
00:45:32,144 --> 00:45:33,265
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

619
00:45:33,265 --> 00:45:34,305
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, what do you have for us?

620
00:45:36,259 --> 00:45:43,707
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, um, we have some Silent Hill 2 news.

621
00:45:43,707 --> 00:45:56,301
[SPEAKER_01]: So, basically, um, we have, uh, Bloober Team is developing a game, uh, with, uh, Skybound Entertainment, it looks like.

622
00:45:58,948 --> 00:46:14,311
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a number of things actually on the list, but they are working on Silent Hill 2 right now, and it looks like that's one of the games they may be working on with them.

623
00:46:16,213 --> 00:46:23,099
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, they're also, though, on the list of things that Skybound is known for.

624
00:46:23,099 --> 00:46:26,962
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's Walking Dead, you know?

625
00:46:26,962 --> 00:46:33,567
[SPEAKER_01]: So they've got a pretty decent track record, I think.

626
00:46:33,567 --> 00:46:42,094
[SPEAKER_01]: On top of that, though, I mean, if we can get a Silent Hill 2 that is

627
00:46:44,005 --> 00:46:47,327
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to think of a tactful way to say this.

628
00:46:47,327 --> 00:46:49,889
[SPEAKER_07]: Acceptable.

629
00:46:49,889 --> 00:46:51,770
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no, not acceptable.

630
00:46:51,770 --> 00:46:55,752
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm thinking of exceptional.

631
00:46:55,752 --> 00:46:58,214
[SPEAKER_01]: I want an exceptional Silent Hill 2.

632
00:46:58,214 --> 00:47:03,477
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, I would have also liked a Silent Hill 3, hint, hint, nudge, nudge.

633
00:47:03,477 --> 00:47:05,598
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that

634
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:09,141
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be great.

635
00:47:09,141 --> 00:47:24,683
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the other thing too, though, is that Blooper is also going to be developing a game that's based off of one of Skybound's IPs, and so that's where there's speculation about Walking Dead, but we don't exactly know which one it is.

636
00:47:27,574 --> 00:47:34,960
[SPEAKER_07]: Could be interesting if it goes that way, towards Walking Dead, because Walking Dead's kind of had a mixed reception on consoles.

637
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:40,045
[SPEAKER_07]: The Telltale games are pretty much accepted as some of the greatest games that were made.

638
00:47:40,045 --> 00:47:55,077
[SPEAKER_07]: But there were some shooty games as well that were the opposite of that, and more along the lines of the reception of Gollum, Lord of the Rings, or whatever the fuck that King Kong game was that they made in a year that's very obvious.

639
00:47:56,558 --> 00:48:09,220
[SPEAKER_07]: So so hopefully if Silent Hill 2 is good because bloopers had a little bit of it There's some hits some misses So as long as like DarkSakura said it's on the hit side of things.

640
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:10,781
[SPEAKER_07]: This could be very exciting.

641
00:48:10,781 --> 00:48:17,222
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll see I'm really Fingers crossed.

642
00:48:17,222 --> 00:48:24,183
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, and by the way, it was denied that there's any sort of pyramid head origin story happening Oh, that's good

643
00:48:25,885 --> 00:48:25,905
[SPEAKER_07]: I

644
00:48:50,090 --> 00:49:04,016
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, so one, we're kind of speculating, like, what's the next Zelda game going to be, obviously, because they've said that they're not going to be doing any more in that whole Breath of the Wild, Tears of the Kingdom universe.

645
00:49:04,016 --> 00:49:06,957
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be a brand new thing that comes out whenever

646
00:49:07,657 --> 00:49:07,817
[SPEAKER_06]: Zelda

647
00:49:24,509 --> 00:49:28,632
[SPEAKER_06]: Not a lot of people have enough creativity to be able to do that.

648
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:34,237
[SPEAKER_06]: They said, when we're creating games like Tears of the Kingdom, I think it's important that we don't make creativity a requirement.

649
00:49:34,237 --> 00:49:41,783
[SPEAKER_06]: Instead, we put things into the game that encourage people to be creative and give them the opportunity to be creative without forcing them to.

650
00:49:41,783 --> 00:49:46,327
[SPEAKER_06]: So apparently, forcing people to be creative is not the thing.

651
00:49:46,327 --> 00:49:47,487
[SPEAKER_06]: But to that I say,

652
00:49:48,814 --> 00:49:50,035
[SPEAKER_06]: then don't buy the game.

653
00:49:50,035 --> 00:49:54,778
[SPEAKER_06]: Like if you knew it was a game where you're just creating levels, that's its own thing.

654
00:49:54,778 --> 00:49:55,959
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like Mario Maker.

655
00:49:55,959 --> 00:49:58,661
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't go to Mario Maker thinking that's a brand new Mario game.

656
00:49:58,661 --> 00:50:03,704
[SPEAKER_06]: I think of it as a game I can make Mario games or levels in.

657
00:50:03,704 --> 00:50:04,004
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

658
00:50:04,004 --> 00:50:06,486
[SPEAKER_06]: So that seems like a bad excuse.

659
00:50:06,486 --> 00:50:12,330
[SPEAKER_06]: Besides, I think they have like a dungeon creator type thing in the Link's Awakening remake.

660
00:50:12,330 --> 00:50:14,352
[SPEAKER_06]: So.

661
00:50:14,352 --> 00:50:16,093
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not entirely true.

662
00:50:16,093 --> 00:50:16,293
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

663
00:50:17,535 --> 00:50:18,976
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, we'll see.

664
00:50:18,976 --> 00:50:26,999
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see what I was just thinking, though, that I saw the you talk about create creativity and, you know, tears, the kingdom, I saw the funniest video.

665
00:50:26,999 --> 00:50:30,241
[SPEAKER_07]: It was somebody created this contraption and what they did.

666
00:50:30,241 --> 00:50:34,322
[SPEAKER_07]: So link picks up a chicken and throws it into a box.

667
00:50:34,322 --> 00:50:37,784
[SPEAKER_07]: So the box is there and there's all these lasers above the box.

668
00:50:37,784 --> 00:50:39,945
[SPEAKER_07]: So when the chicken lands in the box, the lasers go.

669
00:50:41,205 --> 00:51:02,022
[SPEAKER_07]: and start like covering the box and then there's a little conveyor belt outside the box and after the lasers go out pops after like 10 seconds a little roasted chicken comes out the conveyor belts and it's like a four-star roasted chicken in a microwave it's it's literally a chicken murdering machine that just like awesome

670
00:51:05,187 --> 00:51:06,848
[SPEAKER_07]: I need to do this.

671
00:51:06,848 --> 00:51:08,610
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, la la la la la.

672
00:51:08,610 --> 00:51:12,753
[SPEAKER_07]: It reminds me of the whole like, what part of the chicken is the McNugget on?

673
00:51:12,753 --> 00:51:17,156
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, yes, the chicken just turns into a roasted chicken.

674
00:51:17,156 --> 00:51:18,937
[SPEAKER_07]: It's brilliant.

675
00:51:18,937 --> 00:51:21,619
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway.

676
00:51:21,619 --> 00:51:26,883
[SPEAKER_07]: That is that's, I mean, and that's why maybe we don't need a Zelda maker, right?

677
00:51:26,883 --> 00:51:33,107
[SPEAKER_07]: Because these games end up being the makers and you can make horrific things to your heart's content in these games.

678
00:51:33,107 --> 00:51:33,588
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's fun.

679
00:51:34,878 --> 00:51:37,242
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, I wonder what that machine does to people, though.

680
00:51:37,242 --> 00:51:40,827
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you pick up, or I guess- It's made of people!

681
00:51:40,827 --> 00:51:42,410
[SPEAKER_07]: H-Bokoblin!

682
00:51:42,410 --> 00:51:48,239
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess you can't pick up people and throw them into the box, but at least maybe a Moblin or something?

683
00:51:48,239 --> 00:51:49,701
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

684
00:51:49,701 --> 00:51:50,002
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

685
00:51:51,317 --> 00:51:52,398
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's move on.

686
00:51:52,398 --> 00:51:54,580
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my god, this news is epic.

687
00:51:54,580 --> 00:51:55,260
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.

688
00:51:55,260 --> 00:51:57,282
[SPEAKER_07]: This is some this is amazing.

689
00:51:57,282 --> 00:52:04,388
[SPEAKER_07]: And people were talking about this in our discord server this week over at vognetwork.com slash discord and I was like, what for real?

690
00:52:04,388 --> 00:52:06,770
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so here's the deal.

691
00:52:06,770 --> 00:52:07,291
[SPEAKER_07]: Who knew?

692
00:52:08,031 --> 00:52:09,231
[SPEAKER_07]: Alien Resurrection.

693
00:52:09,231 --> 00:52:10,952
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right, the fourth Alien movie.

694
00:52:10,952 --> 00:52:13,853
[SPEAKER_07]: Who knew this was going to be so important all these years later?

695
00:52:13,853 --> 00:52:26,476
[SPEAKER_07]: Because the game, based off the Sigourney Weaver and Winona Ryder starring film, has been unveiled this week to contain the ultimate cheat code.

696
00:52:26,476 --> 00:52:35,098
[SPEAKER_07]: So this game came out in 2000, Alien Resurrection, and it was pretty much towards the end of the PlayStation's lifespan, because PS2 came out in 2001.

697
00:52:38,833 --> 00:52:45,575
[SPEAKER_07]: Argonaut was the studio that made the game and they had previously worked on things like Star Fox and Star Glider.

698
00:52:45,575 --> 00:52:48,356
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, they worked at this.

699
00:52:48,356 --> 00:52:54,518
[SPEAKER_07]: And a cheat code has been unveiled this week by a former Argonaut staffer, Martin Piper.

700
00:52:54,518 --> 00:53:04,041
[SPEAKER_07]: He revealed that the game contains a hidden cheat mode that allows you to play a bootleg game on your PlayStation without the need for an internal mod chip.

701
00:53:06,328 --> 00:53:07,129
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

702
00:53:07,129 --> 00:53:13,113
[SPEAKER_07]: It allows you to just open the lid, do a disc swap, put the new game in and go to town.

703
00:53:13,113 --> 00:53:13,733
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't need it.

704
00:53:13,733 --> 00:53:17,936
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't need one of the cartridge slots in the back, like what I used to have.

705
00:53:17,936 --> 00:53:20,037
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie was the one that taught me how to do that, by the way.

706
00:53:20,037 --> 00:53:21,798
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't need a paper clip.

707
00:53:21,798 --> 00:53:22,859
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't need any of that stuff.

708
00:53:22,859 --> 00:53:24,380
[SPEAKER_01]: Paperclip was the original way.

709
00:53:24,380 --> 00:53:24,860
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

710
00:53:24,860 --> 00:53:28,163
[SPEAKER_07]: You just, it's been hidden for 23 years.

711
00:53:28,163 --> 00:53:34,067
[SPEAKER_06]: It says you still have to put a piece of card to keep the lid, the sensor open.

712
00:53:34,067 --> 00:53:34,667
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can't.

713
00:53:35,267 --> 00:53:38,130
[SPEAKER_06]: You will still need a paperclip.

714
00:53:56,022 --> 00:53:57,143
[SPEAKER_07]: Unnoticed ever.

715
00:53:57,143 --> 00:54:01,445
[SPEAKER_07]: He was basically like, I'm trying to find the quote that he said, but he was basically, oh, here it is.

716
00:54:01,445 --> 00:54:10,010
[SPEAKER_07]: I figured it was so long ago and that I didn't want to get old and die without letting go of these kinds of secrets.

717
00:54:10,010 --> 00:54:11,951
[SPEAKER_07]: What a hero, honestly.

718
00:54:11,951 --> 00:54:22,297
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, he, he just wanted this whole thing went unnoticed because he wanted to find out if this could be changed without having to reset the PS1.

719
00:54:22,297 --> 00:54:24,038
[SPEAKER_07]: He didn't tell any of the other developers.

720
00:54:24,478 --> 00:54:26,641
[SPEAKER_07]: He didn't tell Sony himself.

721
00:54:26,641 --> 00:54:27,842
[SPEAKER_07]: He didn't tell anybody else about this test.

722
00:54:27,842 --> 00:54:31,146
[SPEAKER_07]: Because you're supposed to report to Sony when these games go through certification.

723
00:54:31,146 --> 00:54:33,449
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's all the cheat codes and here's what they do.

724
00:54:33,449 --> 00:54:36,573
[SPEAKER_07]: But he didn't submit this one in that.

725
00:54:36,573 --> 00:54:37,234
[SPEAKER_07]: So.

726
00:54:37,234 --> 00:54:39,396
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, bless him.

727
00:54:39,396 --> 00:54:40,818
[SPEAKER_01]: He's the hero Gotham deserves.

728
00:54:42,748 --> 00:54:46,891
[SPEAKER_07]: with all this talk about gaming preservation, right?

729
00:54:46,891 --> 00:54:50,014
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, we had these other ways of hacking a PS1.

730
00:54:50,014 --> 00:54:56,138
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's like, I feel like for the most part, people can still access and play the PS1 games they want to play.

731
00:54:56,138 --> 00:55:01,362
[SPEAKER_07]: But this sort of sets the stage, like, honestly, in my mind, I'm like, okay, what's next?

732
00:55:01,362 --> 00:55:02,983
[SPEAKER_07]: Who did it on the PS2?

733
00:55:02,983 --> 00:55:05,666
[SPEAKER_07]: What game snuck it in there on the PS2 or the PS3?

734
00:55:05,666 --> 00:55:09,048
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, are we going to find that there's other consoles that had something like this as well?

735
00:55:09,048 --> 00:55:11,430
[SPEAKER_07]: Because that's going to be pretty amazing if so.

736
00:55:11,550 --> 00:55:15,252
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I think there have been other games that have had stuff like that.

737
00:55:15,252 --> 00:55:18,754
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of them they catch, especially if they're updatable.

738
00:55:18,754 --> 00:55:26,419
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of these older ones, though, like with the PlayStation, you can't update PlayStation games, at least the physical games anymore.

739
00:55:26,419 --> 00:55:40,788
[SPEAKER_06]: So there have been things like I know there was like one, there's like an emulator like that they had on the there's like several emulators on the DS that were hidden in games, allowed you to play like retro games and stuff.

740
00:55:40,788 --> 00:55:40,908
[SPEAKER_06]: So.

741
00:55:41,428 --> 00:56:10,170
[SPEAKER_07]: okay so somebody is asking what's the actual cheat code get a pen and paper ready when the game loads you go into the game's option menu to unlock the cheat menu to unlock the cheat menu circle left right circle up r2 that will enable the cheat menu okay now if you want to expand the cheat menu to include stage select you press r1 down r1 right

742
00:56:10,718 --> 00:56:14,160
[SPEAKER_07]: L1 up, L2 square.

743
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:16,882
[SPEAKER_07]: That will enable the stage selection.

744
00:56:16,882 --> 00:56:22,925
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, this cheat code is three layers deep, okay?

745
00:56:22,925 --> 00:56:25,947
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the seven layer bean dip of cheat codes, okay?

746
00:56:25,947 --> 00:56:26,607
[SPEAKER_07]: Here we go.

747
00:56:26,607 --> 00:56:31,490
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, finally, that you've unlocked that, to get the console to boot the disc,

748
00:56:32,230 --> 00:56:40,237
[SPEAKER_07]: Left, Up, Right, Down, Right, Up, Left, Square, Triangle, Square, Triangle, L1.

749
00:56:40,237 --> 00:56:43,220
[SPEAKER_07]: A sound will tell you that the cheat has been applied.

750
00:56:43,220 --> 00:56:47,363
[SPEAKER_07]: You go back to the cheat menu and you select Level 6, Section 1.

751
00:56:48,544 --> 00:56:55,188
[SPEAKER_07]: hold L1, press X, and you keep holding L1 and the disc stops spinning.

752
00:56:55,188 --> 00:56:58,950
[SPEAKER_07]: Now you swap the backup disc with the original disc.

753
00:56:58,950 --> 00:57:06,054
[SPEAKER_07]: And after swapping, hold square and triangle along with L1 and release them all to boot the backup disc.

754
00:57:06,054 --> 00:57:07,014
[SPEAKER_07]: Simple, right?

755
00:57:07,014 --> 00:57:09,035
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope you were writing fast.

756
00:57:09,035 --> 00:57:11,977
[SPEAKER_01]: I wonder if it works with import games.

757
00:57:11,977 --> 00:57:14,298
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't see it works with pirated games.

758
00:57:14,298 --> 00:57:15,258
[SPEAKER_07]: It works with burn games.

759
00:57:15,258 --> 00:57:17,980
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't see why it wouldn't work with import games.

760
00:57:19,457 --> 00:57:19,897
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura

761
00:57:49,312 --> 00:57:49,933
[SPEAKER_07]: Good luck.

762
00:57:49,933 --> 00:57:50,894
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

763
00:57:50,894 --> 00:57:52,715
[SPEAKER_07]: Godspeed in all that.

764
00:57:52,715 --> 00:58:05,628
[SPEAKER_07]: And just just skip to the end because you know 90% of creators are going to be like, and then they're going to spend because because everything on YouTube and Loki I've learned a lot about this lately since I've been expanding more on YouTube.

765
00:58:05,628 --> 00:58:06,208
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have any

766
00:58:07,352 --> 00:58:07,692
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura

767
00:58:28,248 --> 00:58:29,009
[SPEAKER_07]: How is it?

768
00:58:29,009 --> 00:58:32,613
[SPEAKER_07]: What were some of the other ways that people could do these cheat codes?

769
00:58:32,613 --> 00:58:34,955
[SPEAKER_07]: Why might a cheat code like this be important?

770
00:58:34,955 --> 00:58:36,918
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's talk a little bit about game preservation.

771
00:58:36,918 --> 00:58:45,647
[SPEAKER_07]: They want to keep your attention for 20 minutes to rank up their watch hours before they then just give you the fucking cheat code.

772
00:58:45,647 --> 00:58:48,070
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the number one thing I hate about YouTube right now.

773
00:58:49,369 --> 00:58:54,579
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's all because the monetizing algorithm is waiting watch hours.

774
00:58:54,579 --> 00:58:56,242
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, mm hmm.

775
00:58:56,242 --> 00:58:57,284
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, I'll get off.

776
00:58:57,284 --> 00:58:57,765
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll get off my chair.

777
00:58:57,765 --> 00:59:02,013
[SPEAKER_01]: I still don't know if the game's gotten any more value.

778
00:59:02,853 --> 00:59:05,014
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm looking on eBay.

779
00:59:05,014 --> 00:59:06,155
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, especially on eBay.

780
00:59:06,155 --> 00:59:07,356
[SPEAKER_07]: You're probably going to see that right away.

781
00:59:07,356 --> 00:59:21,704
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the type of game like you want to go to your flea markets and that sort of thing like this weekend before news really circulates about this, because the value of this has to go way up after this news comes out.

782
00:59:21,704 --> 00:59:22,264
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.

783
00:59:22,264 --> 00:59:22,885
[SPEAKER_07]: $355, $425.

784
00:59:22,885 --> 00:59:23,385
[SPEAKER_01]: It's already happened.

785
00:59:32,591 --> 00:59:37,755
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe wait for this to stabilize a little bit too.

786
00:59:37,755 --> 00:59:48,423
[SPEAKER_01]: Then again, also Alien Trilogy is also up there, but hits for the Alien Resurrection are pretty expensive.

787
00:59:48,423 --> 00:59:53,227
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow, just get an emulator at that point.

788
00:59:53,227 --> 00:59:54,107
[SPEAKER_07]: Still, kind of neat.

789
00:59:54,107 --> 00:59:57,530
[SPEAKER_01]: Or, you know what, just... I mean, really?

790
00:59:59,244 --> 01:00:09,789
[SPEAKER_01]: I told you back before KB went under, we tore up an entire KB trying to find the last PlayStation that had the I.O.

791
01:00:09,789 --> 01:00:12,350
[SPEAKER_01]: port on the back and we found one.

792
01:00:12,350 --> 01:00:13,670
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.

793
01:00:13,670 --> 01:00:17,052
[SPEAKER_01]: Staff took it as a personal challenge.

794
01:00:17,052 --> 01:00:18,272
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.

795
01:00:18,272 --> 01:00:19,833
[SPEAKER_01]: It was pretty great.

796
01:00:19,833 --> 01:00:21,134
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

797
01:00:21,134 --> 01:00:22,134
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's move on.

798
01:00:22,134 --> 01:00:26,496
[SPEAKER_07]: And DarkSakura, from the past to the future and futures past, right?

799
01:00:29,147 --> 01:00:31,048
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

800
01:00:31,048 --> 01:00:37,030
[SPEAKER_01]: So, Sega has their whole revival thing going on.

801
01:00:37,030 --> 01:00:43,772
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have some new information for the revivals coming out.

802
01:00:43,772 --> 01:00:51,055
[SPEAKER_01]: We have Crazy Taxi, Golden Axe, Jet Set Radio, Shinobi, Streets of Rage.

803
01:00:51,055 --> 01:00:54,976
[SPEAKER_01]: They announced this on December 12th at their management meeting.

804
01:00:56,565 --> 01:01:00,408
[SPEAKER_01]: Jet Set Radio will be in open world Tokyo.

805
01:01:00,408 --> 01:01:05,753
[SPEAKER_01]: Streets of Rage is titled Streets of Rage Revolution.

806
01:01:05,753 --> 01:01:14,240
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, I mean, these, just looking at the artwork for them looks pretty, pretty rad.

807
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:19,805
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, it actually says on the Jet Set Radio little teaser image

808
01:01:21,027 --> 01:01:22,128
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just read it aloud.

809
01:01:22,128 --> 01:01:27,715
[SPEAKER_01]: Counterculture, Tokyo streets, open world.

810
01:01:27,715 --> 01:01:32,721
[SPEAKER_01]: Experience the rebellion movement that feels free in a suffocating society.

811
01:01:32,721 --> 01:01:35,805
[SPEAKER_01]: Make friends, increase your fans, and create a movement.

812
01:01:38,667 --> 01:01:49,410
[SPEAKER_01]: Shinobi's artwork looks just pretty epic too, but it says, grab Oborozuki, the legendary sword, and slay evil once more.

813
01:01:49,410 --> 01:01:52,351
[SPEAKER_01]: Your clan and the world are counting on you.

814
01:01:52,351 --> 01:02:04,075
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Streets of Rage Revolution just says, beloved side-scrolling beat-em-up action series, take control of one of the ex-officers and make the city a place where people no longer have to walk the streets of rage.

815
01:02:06,112 --> 01:02:08,433
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm excited about these revivals.

816
01:02:08,433 --> 01:02:11,294
[SPEAKER_07]: The Jet Set Radio being open world is very interesting.

817
01:02:11,294 --> 01:02:13,575
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah.

818
01:02:13,575 --> 01:02:14,736
[SPEAKER_07]: Looking forward to seeing what develops.

819
01:02:14,736 --> 01:02:16,677
[SPEAKER_07]: I wonder if any of these will actually come out next year.

820
01:02:16,677 --> 01:02:18,077
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see.

821
01:02:18,077 --> 01:02:20,818
[SPEAKER_01]: CrazyTaxi1 says something that's giving me pause.

822
01:02:20,818 --> 01:02:26,261
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, cheerful feeling of freedom cross fusion of nature and city.

823
01:02:28,464 --> 01:02:31,585
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm assuming that just means you can drop people off in the forest.

824
01:02:31,585 --> 01:02:33,745
[SPEAKER_07]: I wonder if it's modeled after San Francisco again.

825
01:02:33,745 --> 01:02:36,706
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe you drive across the Golden Gate and drop people off.

826
01:02:36,706 --> 01:02:37,246
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

827
01:02:37,246 --> 01:02:37,726
[SPEAKER_07]: Who knows?

828
01:02:37,726 --> 01:02:38,366
[SPEAKER_01]: In Marin.

829
01:02:38,366 --> 01:02:39,827
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, in Marin.

830
01:02:39,827 --> 01:02:41,067
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the Skywalker Ranch.

831
01:02:41,067 --> 01:02:41,387
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye.

832
01:02:41,387 --> 01:02:46,488
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, which isn't really, but it's a little more rural than a lot of a lot of the areas out there.

833
01:02:46,488 --> 01:02:50,469
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean, it's kind of up in the hilly part of Marin.

834
01:02:50,469 --> 01:02:50,789
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

835
01:02:50,789 --> 01:02:51,250
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

836
01:02:51,250 --> 01:02:55,551
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, and usually a lot of those games, I don't know, it's dense things.

837
01:02:55,551 --> 01:02:56,051
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

838
01:02:56,051 --> 01:02:56,571
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean,

839
01:02:57,814 --> 01:03:04,496
[SPEAKER_01]: But we have so much more capability now than than that era, the Naomi Dreamcast era.

840
01:03:04,496 --> 01:03:06,737
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think they could do.

841
01:03:06,737 --> 01:03:08,757
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we'll look at the GTA games.

842
01:03:08,757 --> 01:03:15,959
[SPEAKER_01]: What if, you know, we had a crazy taxi that like.

843
01:03:15,959 --> 01:03:19,440
[SPEAKER_01]: Had, you know, that kind of a scale, that would be pretty intense.

844
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:24,942
[SPEAKER_07]: And to be fair, some people play GTA like it is crazy taxi, except instead of dropping the passengers off, they kill them.

845
01:03:26,852 --> 01:03:29,773
[SPEAKER_07]: Crazy Carmageddon

846
01:03:43,453 --> 01:03:59,219
[SPEAKER_01]: like a mode that's like a crazy race where you have to get from point A to point B against another player but you have to pick up passengers on the way and drop them off because that's the only way you're gonna refuel your time limit.

847
01:03:59,219 --> 01:04:03,521
[SPEAKER_06]: Didn't they have that like the Dreamcast version?

848
01:04:03,521 --> 01:04:04,641
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't think it was like that.

849
01:04:04,641 --> 01:04:06,302
[SPEAKER_06]: Like couldn't you play multiplayer split screen in that?

850
01:04:07,725 --> 01:04:10,809
[SPEAKER_01]: But it wasn't quite like what I was thinking.

851
01:04:10,809 --> 01:04:15,977
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I, I, you know, like do something like, like, uh, I almost said LAN, what's up with me?

852
01:04:16,434 --> 01:04:18,435
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, online or something.

853
01:04:18,435 --> 01:04:24,818
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it's also kind of funny to think that, like, now we live in this Lyft and Uber type of world.

854
01:04:24,818 --> 01:04:29,380
[SPEAKER_07]: So I wonder how that might impact kind of what they do with Crazy Taxi.

855
01:04:29,380 --> 01:04:29,860
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

856
01:04:29,860 --> 01:04:37,304
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I wonder if if it's actually a taxi or if it's you can drive different types of cars because it's like Lyft and Uber type of stuff now.

857
01:04:37,304 --> 01:04:37,984
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't know.

858
01:04:37,984 --> 01:04:39,225
[SPEAKER_07]: Just food for thought.

859
01:04:40,726 --> 01:04:44,107
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, Crazy Taxi is just fairly timeless.

860
01:04:44,107 --> 01:04:46,567
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think that they should mess with the formula too much.

861
01:04:46,567 --> 01:04:47,608
[SPEAKER_01]: That's fair.

862
01:04:47,608 --> 01:04:50,028
[SPEAKER_01]: Just add in like extra modes.

863
01:04:50,028 --> 01:04:55,069
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Sia Tabiri is mentioning that almost sounds like the one Simpsons driving game.

864
01:04:55,069 --> 01:04:56,090
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

865
01:04:56,090 --> 01:04:57,450
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember the Simpsons hit and run.

866
01:04:57,450 --> 01:04:58,470
[SPEAKER_07]: The Simpsons hit and run.

867
01:04:58,470 --> 01:05:01,051
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that was fun.

868
01:05:01,051 --> 01:05:03,231
[SPEAKER_07]: Orange Wright says Crazy Taxi competitive mode.

869
01:05:03,231 --> 01:05:05,112
[SPEAKER_07]: That seems like it would be interesting.

870
01:05:05,112 --> 01:05:05,592
[SPEAKER_07]: Esports.

871
01:05:08,484 --> 01:05:12,186
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura is ready to get into e-sports with Competitive Crazy Taxi.

872
01:05:12,186 --> 01:05:15,608
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?

873
01:05:15,608 --> 01:05:21,612
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know what our big thing was for a long time was Hydro Thunder.

874
01:05:21,612 --> 01:05:23,313
[SPEAKER_01]: Hydro Thunder was so good.

875
01:05:23,313 --> 01:05:26,615
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember you all had the actual fucking people don't know this.

876
01:05:26,615 --> 01:05:28,816
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think because I don't think we ever put it on YouTube or anything.

877
01:05:28,816 --> 01:05:30,437
[SPEAKER_07]: You had an actual fucking rig.

878
01:05:30,437 --> 01:05:32,258
[SPEAKER_07]: You may still have it, but I don't know.

879
01:05:32,258 --> 01:05:34,660
[SPEAKER_07]: You have the actual fucking driving rig in your house.

880
01:05:34,660 --> 01:05:34,840
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

881
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:38,541
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we sold that years ago to my friend Travis.

882
01:05:38,541 --> 01:05:39,421
[SPEAKER_07]: But you had one.

883
01:05:39,421 --> 01:05:44,042
[SPEAKER_01]: And that wasn't necessarily... That came after Dreamcast.

884
01:05:44,042 --> 01:05:47,863
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, that was for sim racing.

885
01:05:47,863 --> 01:05:54,784
[SPEAKER_07]: Still, I always thought that was like... There's dedication to your craft, and then there's that.

886
01:05:54,784 --> 01:05:55,244
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no.

887
01:05:55,244 --> 01:06:03,666
[SPEAKER_01]: You should see some of the big sim racers out there, though, that like... We saw this one person who literally bought a race car.

888
01:06:05,003 --> 01:06:09,409
[SPEAKER_01]: And built his multi-window rig inside of a race car.

889
01:06:18,965 --> 01:06:22,388
[SPEAKER_01]: Simracing is, is nuts.

890
01:06:22,388 --> 01:06:29,114
[SPEAKER_01]: You should just check out like the Fanatic forums, F-A-N-A-T-I-C, or with a K, something like that.

891
01:06:29,114 --> 01:06:33,638
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, they're one of the, the big, uh, you know, they, them Thrustmaster.

892
01:06:33,638 --> 01:06:42,206
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's the companies that do all the sim rigs, but I would love having something like that set up for Hydro Thunder or Crazy Taxi.

893
01:06:42,206 --> 01:06:43,547
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it doesn't have to be all of that.

894
01:06:44,528 --> 01:06:47,669
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, multi screen and all of this in front of you.

895
01:06:47,669 --> 01:06:52,691
[SPEAKER_01]: It just needs to be, you know, something that give you a little bit of arcade experience.

896
01:06:52,691 --> 01:06:54,732
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

897
01:06:54,732 --> 01:06:55,412
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, let's move on.

898
01:06:55,412 --> 01:06:59,933
[SPEAKER_07]: We have just a couple more stories for you, and then we're going to get to the classic game of the week and all that good stuff.

899
01:06:59,933 --> 01:07:03,135
[SPEAKER_07]: So, Loki, I guess I kind of spoiled this one earlier.

900
01:07:03,135 --> 01:07:06,516
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, but it was it was kind of in line with what we were talking about at the top.

901
01:07:06,516 --> 01:07:06,876
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean,

902
01:07:07,563 --> 01:07:11,705
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so like, you know, well, we just had a couple leaks, so how about a couple more?

903
01:07:11,705 --> 01:07:20,010
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, now we have Ubisoft saying that on December 20th, an unknown threat actor compromised Ubisoft.

904
01:07:20,010 --> 01:07:31,536
[SPEAKER_06]: They had individual access for roughly 48 hours, and they aimed to exfiltrate roughly 900 gigabytes of data, but lost access.

905
01:07:31,536 --> 01:07:34,777
[SPEAKER_06]: So couldn't get that download finished, I guess.

906
01:07:36,718 --> 01:07:46,605
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, they did apparently review, I guess, data through Microsoft Teams, Confluence, and SharePoint.

907
01:07:46,605 --> 01:07:50,468
[SPEAKER_06]: Looking at corporate documents, I guess.

908
01:07:50,468 --> 01:07:51,609
[SPEAKER_06]: Not sure, though.

909
01:07:51,609 --> 01:07:54,591
[SPEAKER_06]: It says screenshots.

910
01:07:54,591 --> 01:08:04,158
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently, the person that did get in there did have screenshots from the hack, and now they're investigating to see what the extent of it was.

911
01:08:04,963 --> 01:08:11,230
[SPEAKER_06]: So don't be surprised if you get Ubisoft leaks here in the next week or so.

912
01:08:11,230 --> 01:08:12,391
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause it's just going to keep happening.

913
01:08:12,391 --> 01:08:13,653
[SPEAKER_06]: You got to tighten your security folks.

914
01:08:14,899 --> 01:08:17,962
[SPEAKER_07]: Bobby Blackelvenchat says this happens more often than is reported.

915
01:08:17,962 --> 01:08:20,185
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I wonder to what extent.

916
01:08:20,185 --> 01:08:24,509
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure there has to be some sort of sharing that happens between companies.

917
01:08:24,509 --> 01:08:25,810
[SPEAKER_07]: This is very common.

918
01:08:25,810 --> 01:08:36,742
[SPEAKER_07]: Companies that you wouldn't think would work together do when it comes to things like fraud, hacking, these sorts of things.

919
01:08:39,175 --> 01:08:47,260
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know how much I want to say, but in my former job, I was aware of some of this stuff about how like we would work with competitors.

920
01:08:47,260 --> 01:08:49,102
[SPEAKER_07]: And you would think, why would these companies work together?

921
01:08:49,102 --> 01:08:50,923
[SPEAKER_07]: It's because of this.

922
01:08:50,923 --> 01:08:55,746
[SPEAKER_07]: I truly do not know how much this goes on in the gaming industry, how much that type of partnership happens.

923
01:08:55,746 --> 01:08:57,467
[SPEAKER_07]: I imagine it must.

924
01:08:57,467 --> 01:09:07,434
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's one of those things that just isn't talked about for obvious reasons, because you don't want the hackers to know, you know, the bad hackers to know that they're working together, they're enhancing this here.

925
01:09:07,434 --> 01:09:09,075
[SPEAKER_07]: If this isn't happening,

926
01:09:09,355 --> 01:09:12,479
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, VOG Network, Ranma, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

927
01:09:26,397 --> 01:09:27,038
[SPEAKER_07]: you name it.

928
01:09:46,636 --> 01:09:48,797
[SPEAKER_07]: that a lot of that is not kind of out there.

929
01:09:48,797 --> 01:09:53,821
[SPEAKER_07]: But I get why not like I can understand like, yeah, they don't want the hackers to know like how they work together.

930
01:09:53,821 --> 01:09:59,805
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's a interesting Bobby Blackwell in chat says the industry doesn't hate each other like the consumers do.

931
01:09:59,805 --> 01:10:03,287
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah, well, I'll leave that to the youtubers.

932
01:10:03,287 --> 01:10:04,548
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

933
01:10:04,548 --> 01:10:07,850
[SPEAKER_07]: And certain Twitch streamers to be fair, I don't want to just make this a YouTube problem.

934
01:10:07,850 --> 01:10:11,133
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just the excessiveness for clicks problem.

935
01:10:11,133 --> 01:10:11,353
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

936
01:10:12,515 --> 01:10:17,721
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, let's talk about the type of stuff that ought to be getting clicks, dang it.

937
01:10:17,721 --> 01:10:22,006
[SPEAKER_07]: And that is some re-releases of some retro PC titles.

938
01:10:22,006 --> 01:10:26,571
[SPEAKER_07]: And when I mean retro, I mean, like, the really cool retro shit.

939
01:10:26,571 --> 01:10:30,355
[SPEAKER_07]: SSI, or Strategy Simulations Inc., and Mindscape Games.

940
01:10:30,956 --> 01:10:39,203
[SPEAKER_07]: being re-released by the company SNEG on Steam or GOG, good old games, depending on where you prefer to get your games.

941
01:10:39,203 --> 01:10:45,869
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of the games that are coming out with this re-release include... Yes, Bobby Blackwell says this is the Quest Buster section.

942
01:10:46,590 --> 01:10:48,671
[SPEAKER_07]: Very much, but like, you know what?

943
01:10:48,671 --> 01:10:52,814
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob Roberts sees some good stuff in here too, so there's this little something in here for everybody.

944
01:10:52,814 --> 01:11:05,081
[SPEAKER_07]: So, the Fantasy Collection, including Fantasy, Fantasy 2, Fantasy 3, and Fantasy 4, which was exclusively a Japanese home computer release, by the way, even though it was an American developer that made it.

945
01:11:05,081 --> 01:11:08,022
[SPEAKER_07]: Those are coming.

946
01:11:08,022 --> 01:11:10,464
[SPEAKER_07]: We also have the Great Naval Battles Collection.

947
01:11:11,864 --> 01:11:17,666
[SPEAKER_07]: Wargame Construction Set Collection Star Command Prophecy of the Shadow Renegade Battle for Jacob's Star

948
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:35,822
[SPEAKER_07]: which was a sequel to Renegade Legion, which has not been re-released yet.

949
01:11:35,822 --> 01:11:48,789
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we also have Savage Warriors, which is a fighting game, and then Warbreeds, which is like a 90s RTS, but you can modify the unit's DNA to create new configurations.

950
01:11:48,789 --> 01:11:49,569
[SPEAKER_07]: So you know what?

951
01:11:49,569 --> 01:11:56,653
[SPEAKER_07]: There's probably a lot of people that have never heard of these games, and that is exactly why they're being re-released, because this is a really kind of niche

952
01:11:57,213 --> 01:12:01,516
[SPEAKER_07]: Speaking of bringing niche games to the forefront, love that transition, so roll that bumper.

953
01:12:19,952 --> 01:12:27,695
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time, where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

954
01:12:27,695 --> 01:12:31,616
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for the Classic Game of the Week.

955
01:12:31,616 --> 01:12:36,038
[SPEAKER_07]: And what did you pick for us this week, DarkSakura?

956
01:12:36,038 --> 01:12:41,300
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I pointed my compass at Europe and I went for Asterix.

957
01:12:42,672 --> 01:12:54,827
[SPEAKER_01]: So there were a few different platform games that were created and I thought I had picked the first one.

958
01:12:58,649 --> 01:12:59,230
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.

959
01:12:59,230 --> 01:13:00,491
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

960
01:13:00,491 --> 01:13:09,701
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, I actually am going for- I'm trying- You know, this is actually a little bit embarrassing because I thought I had picked the right one.

961
01:13:09,701 --> 01:13:18,010
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, we are gonna go with, uh, just, I guess, uh, some of the games in the series.

962
01:13:18,010 --> 01:13:18,110
[SPEAKER_01]: Um...

963
01:13:21,862 --> 01:13:22,683
[SPEAKER_01]: Super Nintendo

964
01:13:41,650 --> 01:13:44,931
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what, I think I had the right one after all, so pardon me.

965
01:13:44,931 --> 01:13:47,252
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Super Nintendo, is the one we're looking at.

966
01:13:47,252 --> 01:13:50,033
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the game is Asterix.

967
01:13:50,033 --> 01:14:01,597
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is... There are actually three platform games that came out for the NES, the SNES, and the Game Boy.

968
01:14:01,597 --> 01:14:04,878
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're all based off of a comic book series called Asterix.

969
01:14:07,223 --> 01:14:15,650
[SPEAKER_01]: They were only available in PAL regions, so they were all exclusively European.

970
01:14:15,650 --> 01:14:26,918
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically, to go a little bit more with the SNES one, it actually was released in 1993.

971
01:14:26,918 --> 01:14:33,543
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a US release to be considered, but it was cancelled.

972
01:14:34,484 --> 01:14:42,231
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically, a little bit of backstory if no one's familiar with Asterix and Obelix.

973
01:14:42,231 --> 01:14:54,441
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a comic that came out in France by an artist who

974
01:14:57,802 --> 01:15:09,028
[SPEAKER_01]: His name is Albert M. Uderzo and also created by René, I'm going to mispronounce this, Goscinny, who is a Belgian-French artist.

975
01:15:09,028 --> 01:15:17,312
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, but it's about these Gauls who resisted Roman occupation and

976
01:15:18,192 --> 01:15:24,073
[SPEAKER_01]: They are basically, it's their adventures post the Gaulish Wars.

977
01:15:24,073 --> 01:15:30,974
[SPEAKER_01]: There's lots of history involved in it, like real historical references.

978
01:15:30,974 --> 01:15:46,957
[SPEAKER_01]: At any rate, you play as Asterix in this one, and you have to go through different levels all over Europe fighting Romans and animals, and you have to rescue your friend Obelix before Caesar has him thrown to the lions.

979
01:15:48,097 --> 01:16:05,261
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes place in 50 BCE, where Gaul is completely occupied by the Romans and you come from this one village that continues to resist and has a magic potion that makes them invincible.

980
01:16:05,261 --> 01:16:12,042
[SPEAKER_01]: But now that Obelix is gone, basically the Romans have taken him off and you have to go save him.

981
01:16:15,723 --> 01:16:22,610
[SPEAKER_01]: This game, I mean, it's very simple, little platformer.

982
01:16:22,610 --> 01:16:30,678
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can find one that, you know, I'm sure that there are conversions now that make them run at NTSC rates.

983
01:16:33,143 --> 01:16:34,183
[SPEAKER_01]: I've played it.

984
01:16:34,183 --> 01:16:36,925
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually pretty fun.

985
01:16:36,925 --> 01:16:42,107
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a nice little engaging platformer.

986
01:16:42,107 --> 01:16:52,431
[SPEAKER_01]: But the thing is that as far as popularity, two of the biggest franchises at that time in Europe were Asterix and the Smurfs.

987
01:16:53,399 --> 01:16:54,980
[SPEAKER_01]: And we got the Smurfs over here.

988
01:16:54,980 --> 01:16:56,401
[SPEAKER_01]: We got tons of Smurfs games.

989
01:16:56,401 --> 01:17:05,749
[SPEAKER_01]: But Asterix... Now, I remember the Asterix comics being translated in the Sunday paper.

990
01:17:05,749 --> 01:17:13,075
[SPEAKER_06]: I was gonna say, I also remember the SNES Asterix game that was a blockbuster.

991
01:17:13,075 --> 01:17:15,276
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't come out in the US.

992
01:17:15,276 --> 01:17:16,738
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

993
01:17:16,738 --> 01:17:18,159
[SPEAKER_03]: I swear, I remember seeing it.

994
01:17:19,991 --> 01:17:25,746
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, it was cancelled in the US.

995
01:17:25,746 --> 01:17:26,709
[SPEAKER_01]: Asterix Games.

996
01:17:28,152 --> 01:17:41,421
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but basically, um, there was, yeah, there was, I believe, an unreleased version that's floating out there and, like, some Smurfs games.

997
01:17:41,421 --> 01:17:51,668
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but yeah, it was cancelled for the US release, but I do believe that there were other Asterix games that did eventually come out.

998
01:17:51,668 --> 01:17:52,668
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and indeed, uh,

999
01:17:54,281 --> 01:18:02,003
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold on, I'll be able to, I think I know which one did come out over here.

1000
01:18:02,003 --> 01:18:08,385
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to say it was one of the PlayStation releases.

1001
01:18:08,385 --> 01:18:22,269
[SPEAKER_01]: There was, well, maybe it was one of the Sega ones, but I don't think so, because there was Asterix and the Power of the Gods, and there was Asterix the Great Rescue, but I don't believe that either of them

1002
01:18:23,001 --> 01:18:29,405
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm, yeah, I don't remember now.

1003
01:18:29,405 --> 01:18:34,028
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there were there were though a bunch of like a bunch.

1004
01:18:34,028 --> 01:18:35,829
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you know what I'm thinking?

1005
01:18:35,829 --> 01:18:37,269
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm thinking the Lost Vikings.

1006
01:18:37,269 --> 01:18:38,690
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I'm thinking.

1007
01:18:38,690 --> 01:18:39,891
[SPEAKER_01]: The Lost Vikings?

1008
01:18:39,891 --> 01:18:43,093
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's similar, similar, but not quite.

1009
01:18:47,444 --> 01:18:55,071
[SPEAKER_01]: There was the PlayStation one that we didn't get as well that had like really terrible realistic artwork on it.

1010
01:18:55,071 --> 01:18:57,693
[SPEAKER_01]: There was Asterix and Obelix XXL.

1011
01:18:57,693 --> 01:19:02,618
[SPEAKER_01]: There were a few of those that were on PS2.

1012
01:19:02,618 --> 01:19:04,079
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know that we ever got those.

1013
01:19:04,079 --> 01:19:06,041
[SPEAKER_01]: There was Asterix at the Olympic Games.

1014
01:19:09,418 --> 01:19:15,085
[SPEAKER_01]: That one did come out in the U.S., 2008.

1015
01:19:15,085 --> 01:19:23,374
[SPEAKER_01]: So we did get a few of the games in the U.S., but not many of them just because they didn't have the same popularity here.

1016
01:19:23,374 --> 01:19:28,180
[SPEAKER_01]: Although I remember very clearly reading the comics when I was a kid.

1017
01:19:31,192 --> 01:19:32,793
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Great Rescue did make it.

1018
01:19:32,793 --> 01:19:35,494
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, OrangeRite.

1019
01:19:35,494 --> 01:19:41,197
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would say, you know, if you can find an NTSC conversion for the game, definitely give it a play.

1020
01:19:41,197 --> 01:19:43,518
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a fun one.

1021
01:19:43,518 --> 01:19:44,378
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's it.

1022
01:19:44,378 --> 01:19:45,779
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Asterix.

1023
01:19:45,779 --> 01:19:46,719
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1024
01:19:46,719 --> 01:19:47,440
[SPEAKER_07]: There it is.

1025
01:19:47,440 --> 01:19:50,781
[SPEAKER_01]: Product of France.

1026
01:19:50,781 --> 01:19:54,943
[SPEAKER_07]: And product of this classic Game of the Week segment.

1027
01:19:54,943 --> 01:19:55,864
[SPEAKER_07]: The last one.

1028
01:19:56,670 --> 01:19:56,930
[SPEAKER_07]: are here!

1029
01:20:20,902 --> 01:20:21,422
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

1030
01:20:21,422 --> 01:20:27,565
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you might find some repeats from other things I've brought up, but we've got some interesting ones.

1031
01:20:27,565 --> 01:20:31,966
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll send you and Loki the preliminary list so you can get an idea.

1032
01:20:31,966 --> 01:20:33,267
[SPEAKER_07]: Sounds good.

1033
01:20:34,602 --> 01:20:38,865
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, well, we're just about to the end of what we have.

1034
01:20:38,865 --> 01:20:44,589
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Bobby says so asterisk SNES can be a game next month too.

1035
01:20:44,589 --> 01:20:45,349
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it was canceled.

1036
01:20:45,349 --> 01:20:46,010
[SPEAKER_07]: Get it?

1037
01:20:46,010 --> 01:20:47,831
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1038
01:20:47,831 --> 01:20:51,934
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's move on and talk about some other news very quickly here.

1039
01:20:51,934 --> 01:21:00,119
[SPEAKER_07]: We're actually getting towards the end because again, with it being a holiday week, we don't have quite as much news, but we have at least one email tonight and maybe some calls.

1040
01:21:00,119 --> 01:21:04,502
[SPEAKER_07]: But let's check in with Rapid Fire News first with just Loki with a couple stories tonight.

1041
01:21:05,182 --> 01:21:07,504
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so a couple quick announcements.

1042
01:21:07,504 --> 01:21:22,674
[SPEAKER_06]: So there is a big announcement by Amazon Studios and Games Workshop that they are working with Henry Cavill to bring Warhammer 40,000 to movies and television.

1043
01:21:22,674 --> 01:21:26,236
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to be having multiple projects based around that.

1044
01:21:26,236 --> 01:21:29,919
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know Henry Cavill is a very huge Warhammer fan.

1045
01:21:30,519 --> 01:21:33,081
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's exciting.

1046
01:21:33,081 --> 01:21:36,823
[SPEAKER_06]: And he's going to be an executive producer on these.

1047
01:21:36,823 --> 01:21:42,966
[SPEAKER_06]: So someone that clearly loves the franchise, going to bring that stuff to the screen.

1048
01:21:42,966 --> 01:21:44,547
[SPEAKER_06]: Sign me up.

1049
01:21:44,547 --> 01:21:46,689
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm down.

1050
01:21:46,689 --> 01:21:51,131
[SPEAKER_06]: PlayStation 5 has surpassed 50 million units sold now.

1051
01:21:51,131 --> 01:21:54,853
[SPEAKER_06]: Not bad, considering they had shortages for a long time.

1052
01:21:54,853 --> 01:21:57,315
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1053
01:21:57,315 --> 01:21:59,476
[SPEAKER_07]: That's very well done to them.

1054
01:22:00,492 --> 01:22:01,293
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

1055
01:22:01,293 --> 01:22:02,794
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1056
01:22:02,794 --> 01:22:05,697
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we'll get some other news in a couple weeks.

1057
01:22:05,697 --> 01:22:06,458
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're back.

1058
01:22:06,458 --> 01:22:09,441
[SPEAKER_07]: But for now, let's travel around the world and check out release dates.

1059
01:22:09,441 --> 01:22:17,368
[SPEAKER_07]: I, I have a feeling it's going to be a big zilch because this is going to be this is almost nothing, but I'm going to check anyway.

1060
01:22:17,368 --> 01:22:18,229
[SPEAKER_07]: Just be thorough.

1061
01:22:18,229 --> 01:22:20,831
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we have anything coming out in the US this week, Loki?

1062
01:22:20,831 --> 01:22:24,255
[SPEAKER_06]: We have pinball M coming out Nintendo switch.

1063
01:22:24,255 --> 01:22:24,655
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it.

1064
01:22:24,795 --> 01:22:28,298
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I forgot to mention I did play that this week a little bit.

1065
01:22:28,298 --> 01:22:32,621
[SPEAKER_07]: I picked up the free version of that because it comes with one table free.

1066
01:22:32,621 --> 01:22:35,803
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you can play the other tables for like a three minute trial.

1067
01:22:35,803 --> 01:22:38,405
[SPEAKER_07]: And I did try that Dead by Daylight table.

1068
01:22:38,405 --> 01:22:45,770
[SPEAKER_07]: And the thing that cracked me up most about the Dead by Daylight table is that I was like, oh, OK, it's like the core four survivors.

1069
01:22:45,770 --> 01:22:48,872
[SPEAKER_07]: But then when I looked carefully, I was like, oh, it's Dwight.

1070
01:22:50,513 --> 01:22:54,397
[SPEAKER_07]: Claudette, Jake, and Fong Min are the survivors.

1071
01:22:54,397 --> 01:22:55,938
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was like, wait a minute.

1072
01:22:55,938 --> 01:22:58,420
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, that's actually not the core four.

1073
01:22:58,420 --> 01:22:58,861
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my God.

1074
01:22:58,861 --> 01:23:02,063
[SPEAKER_07]: They deleted Meg.

1075
01:23:02,063 --> 01:23:05,646
[SPEAKER_01]: Nope.

1076
01:23:05,646 --> 01:23:09,930
[SPEAKER_07]: Fong Min has taken her place officially.

1077
01:23:09,930 --> 01:23:11,812
[SPEAKER_07]: That crapped me up.

1078
01:23:14,898 --> 01:23:18,301
[SPEAKER_01]: Why do they keep giving her all the cosmetics and now they take out Meg?

1079
01:23:18,301 --> 01:23:19,542
[SPEAKER_07]: How dare?

1080
01:23:19,542 --> 01:23:20,422
[SPEAKER_07]: It's rude.

1081
01:23:20,422 --> 01:23:21,943
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just the pinball table.

1082
01:23:21,943 --> 01:23:22,604
[SPEAKER_07]: And who knows?

1083
01:23:22,604 --> 01:23:23,605
[SPEAKER_07]: There could be more.

1084
01:23:23,605 --> 01:23:24,726
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, who knows?

1085
01:23:24,726 --> 01:23:26,767
[SPEAKER_07]: But it did crack me.

1086
01:23:26,767 --> 01:23:29,289
[SPEAKER_06]: They're like treating her like Meg from Family Guy.

1087
01:23:29,289 --> 01:23:30,550
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1088
01:23:30,550 --> 01:23:36,494
[SPEAKER_07]: And to be fair, I think the pinball table is from the perspective of the trapper, because I think you're actually trying to hook the survivors.

1089
01:23:36,494 --> 01:23:38,676
[SPEAKER_07]: I couldn't really tell what the story was going on.

1090
01:23:38,676 --> 01:23:42,179
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, I did play that just a little bit.

1091
01:23:42,179 --> 01:23:42,279
[SPEAKER_07]: So.

1092
01:23:43,035 --> 01:23:48,001
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, well, traveling over to Japan and checking out the releases there, nothing.

1093
01:23:48,001 --> 01:23:55,591
[SPEAKER_07]: The only thing of note is that if you still, I don't know how you could possibly still have not beaten Yakuza Like a Dragon.

1094
01:23:56,581 --> 01:24:03,945
[SPEAKER_07]: But if that's you, you can now get a price-reduced version coming out in Japan this week on the PlayStation 5.

1095
01:24:03,945 --> 01:24:11,569
[SPEAKER_07]: That is the only new release, because technically it's a new pressing of the game, because it gets the special box that says, I'm cheap.

1096
01:24:11,569 --> 01:24:15,612
[SPEAKER_07]: So that is the only release in Japan this week on the 26th.

1097
01:24:15,612 --> 01:24:18,533
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, anything in Europe?

1098
01:24:18,533 --> 01:24:19,514
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing.

1099
01:24:19,514 --> 01:24:19,914
[SPEAKER_07]: Nothing.

1100
01:24:19,914 --> 01:24:20,774
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1101
01:24:20,774 --> 01:24:21,035
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1102
01:24:23,339 --> 01:24:29,424
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we'll try again in a couple weeks when things maybe will pick up a little bit again as we get into the new year.

1103
01:24:29,424 --> 01:24:38,692
[SPEAKER_07]: It used to be that January was usually a barren month, but that pattern's kind of changed in the last couple years, so be curious to see that when we come back.

1104
01:24:39,392 --> 01:24:48,441
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, let's get to the listener roundtable where we invite your calls and so forth to participate with our show tonight.

1105
01:24:48,441 --> 01:24:50,282
[SPEAKER_07]: We also invite your emails every week.

1106
01:24:50,282 --> 01:24:54,766
[SPEAKER_07]: Participate at OrangeLoungeRater.com is the place to send your emails.

1107
01:24:54,766 --> 01:24:57,249
[SPEAKER_07]: And I believe we do have one to read tonight, right, DarkSakura?

1108
01:24:59,264 --> 01:25:00,084
[SPEAKER_01]: We do.

1109
01:25:00,084 --> 01:25:02,946
[SPEAKER_01]: It was one that I missed and I'm sorry about this.

1110
01:25:02,946 --> 01:25:05,947
[SPEAKER_01]: So this was from the 12th.

1111
01:25:05,947 --> 01:25:08,729
[SPEAKER_01]: It was buried in the spam.

1112
01:25:08,729 --> 01:25:10,810
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll go ahead and read.

1113
01:25:10,810 --> 01:25:14,011
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey OLR, it's been a while since I last wrote in.

1114
01:25:14,011 --> 01:25:21,755
[SPEAKER_01]: I heard on the last episode that Loki got a Playdate console and wanted to confirm that it's become a wonderful platform for making indie games.

1115
01:25:22,375 --> 01:25:31,101
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only is the development platform free and well-documented, but there's now a healthy, if small, market of players willing to pay for tiny indie games.

1116
01:25:31,101 --> 01:25:37,304
[SPEAKER_01]: I was lucky to be in the first batch of pre-orders and released a puzzle game called Squish last summer.

1117
01:25:37,304 --> 01:25:40,306
[SPEAKER_01]: To my delight, it's now sold over a thousand copies.

1118
01:25:40,306 --> 01:25:44,229
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't see that ever happening for me on mobile or PC.

1119
01:25:44,229 --> 01:25:46,230
[SPEAKER_01]: Best of luck with your Playdate development, Loki.

1120
01:25:46,230 --> 01:25:48,391
[SPEAKER_01]: Perhaps a one-bit pixel poops.

1121
01:25:48,391 --> 01:25:48,732
[SPEAKER_01]: Elliot B.

1122
01:25:49,412 --> 01:25:50,912
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought about that.

1123
01:25:50,912 --> 01:25:52,133
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a possibility.

1124
01:25:52,133 --> 01:25:54,913
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I appreciate it.

1125
01:25:54,913 --> 01:25:59,114
[SPEAKER_06]: I got the one code for Squish, and I need to figure out how to sideload stuff.

1126
01:25:59,114 --> 01:26:00,435
[SPEAKER_06]: I think there's a way to do it.

1127
01:26:00,435 --> 01:26:05,756
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to go and log into your Play Day account and do it that way.

1128
01:26:05,756 --> 01:26:06,936
[SPEAKER_06]: But that should be fine.

1129
01:26:06,936 --> 01:26:11,238
[SPEAKER_06]: I was thinking game-wise, yeah, I still want to do a mini-golf game, I think.

1130
01:26:11,238 --> 01:26:16,779
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be really good, especially with the crank, because executive golf is okay, but it's not...

1131
01:26:18,470 --> 01:26:20,793
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not like a real golf game.

1132
01:26:20,793 --> 01:26:22,474
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just side scrolling.

1133
01:26:22,474 --> 01:26:23,896
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of weird.

1134
01:26:23,896 --> 01:26:36,930
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think a game that actually used the crank as like a putter, so you're actually like swinging it like a putter and like how fast you swing it now, all that would be really cool to just have it almost completely cranked base.

1135
01:26:37,150 --> 01:26:38,071
[SPEAKER_07]: Patent pending.

1136
01:26:38,071 --> 01:26:39,491
[SPEAKER_07]: Somebody's gonna steal your idea, Loki.

1137
01:26:39,491 --> 01:26:40,052
[SPEAKER_07]: You're saying too much.

1138
01:26:40,052 --> 01:26:41,433
[SPEAKER_06]: Patent pending.

1139
01:26:41,433 --> 01:26:44,394
[SPEAKER_01]: It has to be some fishing games on there, I'm sure.

1140
01:26:44,394 --> 01:27:06,648
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a fishing game, and then there's one that's called Real Steel, and it's basically, you're using a fishing rod, and it's almost like that Mission Impossible thing, where you're dropping in to steal things, so you're using a fishing rod in that sense as well, and you crank the guy up and down and steal stuff.

1141
01:27:08,260 --> 01:27:10,522
[SPEAKER_01]: I just had an idea.

1142
01:27:10,522 --> 01:27:15,468
[SPEAKER_01]: Bungie ferret tossing with the crank.

1143
01:27:15,468 --> 01:27:19,052
[SPEAKER_06]: How do you toss the... Oh, I guess swinging it back and forth?

1144
01:27:19,052 --> 01:27:20,353
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, yeah, you can make it.

1145
01:27:20,353 --> 01:27:21,194
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, you just have to...

1146
01:27:21,957 --> 01:27:31,623
[SPEAKER_06]: CodeWithIt, because they have their pulp editor, which is kind of drag and drop, and it's got its own scripting language with it.

1147
01:27:31,623 --> 01:27:35,826
[SPEAKER_06]: Or if you want to go more traditional, there is Lua.

1148
01:27:35,826 --> 01:27:42,550
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you really want to get into high performance with that, there's C APIs for it as well.

1149
01:27:45,137 --> 01:27:56,047
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm not sure what I would need for... pulp might be enough, but there's a lot of tutorials out there showing just how to use the pulp editor and everything.

1150
01:27:56,047 --> 01:27:57,048
[SPEAKER_06]: It's worth messing around with.

1151
01:27:57,048 --> 01:28:06,176
[SPEAKER_06]: At the very least, even if you can't get a playdate, you can play it through their emulator that they have on their website, so you can play stuff that way and test stuff out.

1152
01:28:06,176 --> 01:28:07,797
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, maybe I'll take a look at it.

1153
01:28:07,797 --> 01:28:08,237
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

1154
01:28:08,237 --> 01:28:10,880
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got one lesson left on my Python course.

1155
01:28:10,880 --> 01:28:12,221
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of where I'm focusing.

1156
01:28:13,800 --> 01:28:14,541
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

1157
01:28:40,251 --> 01:28:42,171
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you pooped on your friends right now?

1158
01:29:06,665 --> 01:29:08,646
[SPEAKER_07]: Poop with friends.

1159
01:29:08,646 --> 01:29:10,847
[SPEAKER_06]: What's an OLR pinball golf game?

1160
01:29:10,847 --> 01:29:12,367
[SPEAKER_06]: How would that work?

1161
01:29:12,367 --> 01:29:13,327
[SPEAKER_06]: Pinball golf?

1162
01:29:13,327 --> 01:29:15,468
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, pinball golf could be fun.

1163
01:29:15,468 --> 01:29:23,951
[SPEAKER_06]: I like was thinking like when I think of a golf, like a mini golf game, like prime mini golf game, 3D Ultra mini golf obviously is good.

1164
01:29:23,951 --> 01:29:25,272
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are like pretty awesome.

1165
01:29:25,272 --> 01:29:31,714
[SPEAKER_06]: But even like the first mini golf game that I really liked was on the Apple II and it was called Gnarly Golf.

1166
01:29:32,574 --> 01:29:46,561
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's kind of what I'm trying to emulate there, because it's basically like courses where not traditional stuff is like, oh, you're a golf ball in a prison cell, and you have to figure out where the hole is.

1167
01:29:46,561 --> 01:29:52,143
[SPEAKER_06]: Or, oh, this one, you're in a backyard, and you have to avoid a hose, and stuff like that.

1168
01:29:52,143 --> 01:29:53,564
[SPEAKER_06]: That's my kind of thought.

1169
01:29:54,204 --> 01:29:56,406
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, regular mini-golf stuff.

1170
01:29:56,406 --> 01:29:57,187
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll be fun.

1171
01:29:57,187 --> 01:29:59,429
[SPEAKER_06]: Mini-golf's a fun pick-up-and-play type thing.

1172
01:29:59,429 --> 01:30:00,770
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1173
01:30:00,770 --> 01:30:03,633
[SPEAKER_06]: But there's not really... I'm surprised there's not any on there.

1174
01:30:03,633 --> 01:30:06,295
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, there's a tank golf game and then there's executive golf.

1175
01:30:06,295 --> 01:30:12,200
[SPEAKER_07]: If you keep talking and don't do it, somebody's gonna... Look, you've got a Playdate developer listening to this show.

1176
01:30:12,921 --> 01:30:13,641
[SPEAKER_07]: That's fine.

1177
01:30:13,641 --> 01:30:22,166
[SPEAKER_07]: If I'm Elliot B, I'm sitting there twiddling my fingers going, yes, this sounds like a very good idea to add to my collection of games.

1178
01:30:22,166 --> 01:30:28,669
[SPEAKER_07]: That fool, Loki, giving me ideas for free.

1179
01:30:28,669 --> 01:30:34,832
[SPEAKER_07]: And Bobby, Bobby's literally admitting to doing the same thing right now in chat.

1180
01:30:34,832 --> 01:30:35,932
[SPEAKER_07]: All good?

1181
01:30:35,932 --> 01:30:37,093
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1182
01:30:37,093 --> 01:30:37,573
[SPEAKER_07]: You can do it.

1183
01:30:37,573 --> 01:30:40,555
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's not a lot of games on their storefront, like their storefront has

1184
01:30:41,718 --> 01:30:44,199
[SPEAKER_06]: like 50 or 60 games.

1185
01:30:44,199 --> 01:30:45,439
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not a lot.

1186
01:30:45,439 --> 01:30:47,880
[SPEAKER_06]: So like it's easy to stand out so far.

1187
01:30:47,880 --> 01:30:49,500
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1188
01:30:49,500 --> 01:30:53,021
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I'm going to assume there's no last minute stories tonight.

1189
01:30:53,021 --> 01:30:55,461
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I did want to mention one last thing I just had.

1190
01:30:55,461 --> 01:31:05,844
[SPEAKER_06]: I had to laugh and it's not even really newsworthy, but the Amico at home added another game to their platform, which I was like, it looks like crap, but whatever.

1191
01:31:06,668 --> 01:31:16,717
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, why even put out that announcement, but, oh, you got a whole total of three games on your platform that requires two mobile devices to actually even use.

1192
01:31:16,717 --> 01:31:23,083
[SPEAKER_07]: They are, they are selling what they can to make any kind of income right now.

1193
01:31:23,083 --> 01:31:28,208
[SPEAKER_07]: But I will bet you've probably sold more copies of Pixel Poops than they've sold of Shark Shark.

1194
01:31:28,208 --> 01:31:32,472
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can, you can go to sleep at night thinking about that.

1195
01:31:33,496 --> 01:31:35,256
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1196
01:31:35,256 --> 01:31:39,678
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow, that is going to wrap it up for our special holiday edition of the show.

1197
01:31:39,678 --> 01:31:43,419
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, just to recap what's coming up next week, we will not be here.

1198
01:31:43,419 --> 01:31:45,739
[SPEAKER_07]: So the weekend of New Year's Eve, there will be no show.

1199
01:31:45,739 --> 01:31:48,300
[SPEAKER_07]: So no show here and no show on the podcast feed.

1200
01:31:48,300 --> 01:31:52,321
[SPEAKER_07]: So hope you all have a great new year and a safe one, of course.

1201
01:31:52,321 --> 01:31:59,103
[SPEAKER_07]: We will be back live the Sunday after New Year's Eve, which would be January the 7th.

1202
01:31:59,103 --> 01:32:00,103
[SPEAKER_07]: Looking at my calendar here.

1203
01:32:00,583 --> 01:32:03,684
[SPEAKER_07]: at our normal time, nine o'clock Eastern, six o'clock Pacific.

1204
01:32:03,684 --> 01:32:08,386
[SPEAKER_07]: We will be back with the next episode of our program.

1205
01:32:08,386 --> 01:32:13,348
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope you all have a great couple weeks and enjoying the rest of your 2023.

1206
01:32:13,348 --> 01:32:17,650
[SPEAKER_07]: Look forward to 2024 and all the stuff coming up.

1207
01:32:17,650 --> 01:32:19,691
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's going to do it.

1208
01:32:19,691 --> 01:32:24,012
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, are you streaming today or are you just not doing that today or what?

1209
01:32:24,012 --> 01:32:24,913
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably not.

1210
01:32:24,913 --> 01:32:26,093
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

1211
01:32:26,093 --> 01:32:28,054
[SPEAKER_01]: Just, you know, it's holiday.

1212
01:32:28,054 --> 01:32:29,515
[SPEAKER_01]: If I stream, I stream.

1213
01:32:29,515 --> 01:32:30,335
[SPEAKER_01]: If I don't, I don't.

1214
01:32:31,059 --> 01:32:39,124
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, you know what, I'll put it, you know, I'm gonna, I'm gonna buy somebody a copy of Pixel Poops number 2.

1215
01:32:39,124 --> 01:32:40,285
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.

1216
01:32:40,285 --> 01:32:46,709
[SPEAKER_06]: I sold one yesterday, and that's been the first time in like, six months.

1217
01:32:46,709 --> 01:32:49,210
[SPEAKER_07]: Somebody shit on someone for Christmas.

1218
01:32:49,210 --> 01:32:49,651
[SPEAKER_07]: I love it.

1219
01:32:52,319 --> 01:33:01,282
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, thank you so much for downloading our show or listening live, especially if you were here at the early time on Christmas Eve.

1220
01:33:01,282 --> 01:33:03,822
[SPEAKER_07]: Super appreciate those of you that are here live.

1221
01:33:14,025 --> 01:33:15,766
[SPEAKER_07]: Love all of you on the podcast feed as well.

1222
01:33:15,766 --> 01:33:17,627
[SPEAKER_07]: I noticed there are some absent names tonight.

1223
01:33:17,627 --> 01:33:21,469
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm assuming y'all just have holiday plans and you'll probably catch us on the podcast feed.

1224
01:33:21,469 --> 01:33:22,390
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you.

1225
01:33:22,390 --> 01:33:24,411
[SPEAKER_07]: No matter how it is you listen to this show.

1226
01:33:24,411 --> 01:33:27,173
[SPEAKER_07]: We appreciate you being here and being part of the fam.

1227
01:33:27,173 --> 01:33:31,315
[SPEAKER_07]: If you enjoyed what you heard here at OLR, help us spread the word, tell a friend or two.

1228
01:33:31,315 --> 01:33:34,237
[SPEAKER_07]: We are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we need more voices to put out on air.

1229
01:33:34,637 --> 01:33:36,599
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, your final thoughts tonight.

1230
01:33:45,831 --> 01:33:55,834
[SPEAKER_01]: So, if I do stream, it will be around about 8.30ish, some Dead by Daylight Killer.

1231
01:33:55,834 --> 01:33:58,875
[SPEAKER_01]: Who knows, maybe I'll take a request, maybe I'll play Pixel Poops.

1232
01:33:58,875 --> 01:34:01,676
[SPEAKER_01]: If I can get everything working the right way.

1233
01:34:01,676 --> 01:34:03,597
[SPEAKER_01]: I may not be able to on my Mac, but we'll see.

1234
01:34:05,496 --> 01:34:18,062
[SPEAKER_01]: And other than that, you know, I since I won't see y'all in this form for till the new year rolls around.

1235
01:34:18,062 --> 01:34:21,564
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish everyone.

1236
01:34:21,564 --> 01:34:33,590
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, I'll I'll say the same thing that I say at the end of my stream, just to be kind to yourself, be kind to other people and fact check everything.

1237
01:34:33,590 --> 01:34:33,990
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all.

1238
01:34:35,165 --> 01:34:38,670
[SPEAKER_07]: That's very similar to what Jerry Springer used to say without the fact-checking part.

1239
01:34:38,670 --> 01:34:41,153
[SPEAKER_07]: He used to say, be kind to yourself and each other.

1240
01:34:41,153 --> 01:34:41,754
[SPEAKER_07]: Or was it be good?

1241
01:34:41,754 --> 01:34:43,936
[SPEAKER_07]: No, be good to yourself and each other.

1242
01:34:43,936 --> 01:34:44,597
[SPEAKER_07]: Similar.

1243
01:34:44,597 --> 01:34:45,919
[SPEAKER_01]: I would prefer kindness.

1244
01:34:45,919 --> 01:34:48,582
[SPEAKER_01]: Goodness and kindness are different.

1245
01:34:48,582 --> 01:34:49,003
[SPEAKER_07]: Fair enough.

1246
01:34:49,003 --> 01:34:51,025
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1247
01:34:51,025 --> 01:34:52,047
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, your final thought tonight.

1248
01:34:53,120 --> 01:34:57,724
[SPEAKER_06]: And my final thought is, hopefully we'll have more Minecraft content coming out.

1249
01:34:57,724 --> 01:35:06,471
[SPEAKER_06]: I also, Hermitcraft Season 9 finally wrapped, and so they put their world download up, and I've uploaded that to play some Decked Out.

1250
01:35:06,471 --> 01:35:07,632
[SPEAKER_06]: It's ridiculous.

1251
01:35:07,632 --> 01:35:09,514
[SPEAKER_06]: Tango did an incredible job with Decked Out.

1252
01:35:09,514 --> 01:35:14,458
[SPEAKER_06]: It's literally like a whole other dungeon crawling game inside vanilla Minecraft.

1253
01:35:14,458 --> 01:35:15,659
[SPEAKER_06]: It's absolutely insane.

1254
01:35:15,659 --> 01:35:19,822
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm going to do something similar like that in probably a year or so, so it'll be fun.

1255
01:35:22,518 --> 01:35:26,780
[SPEAKER_07]: And then my final thought is, I hope Loki will play some Lego Fortnite with me sometime.

1256
01:35:26,780 --> 01:35:28,201
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that would be fun.

1257
01:35:28,201 --> 01:35:29,342
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura can too if she wants.

1258
01:35:29,342 --> 01:35:31,823
[SPEAKER_01]: I watched someone play that last night.

1259
01:35:31,823 --> 01:35:34,785
[SPEAKER_07]: Isn't it wild that it's like, wait a minute, Fortnite?

1260
01:35:34,785 --> 01:35:35,225
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

1261
01:35:35,225 --> 01:35:36,886
[SPEAKER_07]: No, this isn't it.

1262
01:35:36,886 --> 01:35:40,088
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know that it's enough to make me want to play Fortnite.

1263
01:35:41,385 --> 01:35:42,646
[SPEAKER_07]: So, all right.

1264
01:35:42,646 --> 01:35:46,388
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, thank you so much, everybody, for being here, and I appreciate it.

1265
01:35:46,388 --> 01:35:52,311
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, shout out to WayneNN in chat, who says, thanks to both OLR and Bobby for taking the time to do the early shows.

1266
01:35:52,311 --> 01:35:53,672
[SPEAKER_07]: Great to be able to watch live.

1267
01:35:53,672 --> 01:35:58,434
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, if one person was able to catch it that couldn't usually catch it, it was totally worth the earlier time.

1268
01:35:58,434 --> 01:35:58,735
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

1269
01:35:58,735 --> 01:36:01,856
[SPEAKER_07]: It frees up our evenings to do our own stuff, too.

1270
01:36:01,856 --> 01:36:02,817
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't mind the early time.

1271
01:36:02,817 --> 01:36:03,957
[SPEAKER_07]: This was actually a lot of fun.

1272
01:36:03,957 --> 01:36:04,698
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you so much.

1273
01:36:04,698 --> 01:36:07,059
[SPEAKER_07]: We need to do this more often, actually.

1274
01:36:07,059 --> 01:36:10,201
[SPEAKER_07]: But thank you so much, everybody, for being here and listening.

1275
01:36:10,541 --> 01:36:15,664
[SPEAKER_07]: Have a happy, safe New Year, and we will see you in two weeks.

1276
01:36:15,664 --> 01:36:18,645
[SPEAKER_07]: Good night, everybody.

1277
01:36:18,645 --> 01:36:22,267
[SPEAKER_05]: Bye.

1278
01:36:22,267 --> 01:36:26,829

1279
01:36:26,829 --> 01:36:31,911
