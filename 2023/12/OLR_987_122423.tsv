27342	31584	Your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Sommers, and Loki, iambic pentameter arranged.
31584	33786	Let's get to the news, I bet you'll rejoice.
33786	36588	Tuned in to Orange Lounge Radio, where every gamer has a voice.
39738	53310	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice it is Orange Lounge Radio live once again at a special time on this December 24th 2023
55071	57252	with episode number 987 of our show.
57252	59312	If it sounds like I'm laughing, it's because I am.
59312	63693	That's actually the first time I heard Jason's special little rhymy intro for tonight.
63693	64773	That was super cute.
64773	67454	Thank you, as always, to our voiceover guy, Jason.
67454	71715	And thank you to all of you who are tuning in live at this special time.
71715	80597	So usually we tape every week at The Voice of Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash VOG Network at 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific, right after the Bobby Blackwell Show.
80597	80957	However,
81337	84018	today being a special day, a holiday.
84018	94723	We are doing a special show at three Eastern, noon Pacific, and, you know, perhaps overseas eight o'clock, nine o'clock in the evening, depending on where you are overseas.
94723	98465	So just a little bit of a special time here on this Christmas Eve.
98465	107069	I'm Rob Roberts, and I'm joined as always, despite the day time difference on the day, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
110515	112556	who, there, hello.
112556	114077	I'm awake.
114077	118379	You're what?
118379	119980	Okay, I'm not sure what's happening with your music audio.
119980	120721	I said I'm awake.
120721	122121	Oh, you're awake.
122121	124082	It's just very lagged, I think, today.
124082	125723	I like- I know what's happening with my audio.
125723	127704	It's the same thing that happens every week.
127704	128465	Yeah.
128465	129265	I have lag.
129265	130326	Yeah.
130326	135288	It didn't used to be there, but I noticed you have, your VTuber is, where are you?
135288	137269	Yeah, it's been there for the last month or so.
139315	141478	I can scroll out if you want to see the whole thing.
141478	141778	Hold on.
141778	142759	Let's do this.
142759	143360	Whoa.
157981	159001	Oh, that is super cute.
159001	159942	I like that.
159942	160582	Okay.
160582	165243	So again, if you want to see the video, of course, everyone's gonna see me playing with my sliders.
165243	166323	It's fine over at Twitch.
166323	173965	It's not the first time over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network is where you can check that out as we are live.
173965	174445	And thank you.
174445	179546	Also, I want to acknowledge I see you all are being very generous with the hype train and chat right now.
179546	179846	Thank you.
179846	180767	Thank you so much for that.
180767	185748	I really do appreciate that, especially the fact that it's a weird time today.
186528	191633	Um, also say hello joining us, of course, to the one and only Techmaster Loki.
191633	192153	Hello.
192153	192594	Hi, Loki.
192594	193635	How are you?
193635	194436	I'm doing pretty good.
194436	195056	Good, good.
195056	196778	What is this game playing behind you tonight?
196778	197539	I'm not sure.
197539	198700	Is this Power Washer?
198700	201923	It looks... It is Power Washer.
201923	203264	Oh, I just haven't seen this level.
203264	207348	This must be like a special like Santa's Workshop or something level.
207348	207988	Yep.
207988	209390	It's Santa's Workshop DLC.
210259	210861	Oh, fun.
210861	211482	Okay.
211482	217518	You know, I never did end up playing the Final Fantasy VII DLC, I think they had at one point.
218264	219825	But yeah, I have it.
219825	220906	I haven't played it either.
220906	223627	Same with the Back to the Future one as well.
223627	227570	That game is the PlayStation Plus game right now.
227570	230692	So a whole other reason to play it again.
230692	234074	If, you know, Game Pass or whatever other way of getting that game.
234074	238676	I think I just bought it on early access on Steam, quite honestly, isn't good enough.
238676	240657	I mean, there's plenty of ways to check out PowerWash.
240657	246201	They also have a VR version if you happen to be ever so inclined to play the VR stuff.
246201	246341	Yeah.
246661	251042	I mean, like, it surprises me, but it doesn't.
251042	252482	I kind of want to play the VR version.
252482	253403	I think that'd be a lot of fun.
253403	254423	That might be interesting.
254423	255563	Yeah, I'd check that out.
255563	262525	But OK, wow, Santa's workshop is very dirty outside of that close rack, the immediate field of view.
262525	267666	Well, like the original game, the meta was that it was supposed to be a volcano that went off.
267666	270166	So I don't know how that has anything.
270166	272527	I think it's just an excuse to put dirt everywhere.
273069	280614	Well, I'm sure there are lots of games folks are catching up on over this holiday break for many people or just even if it's a day or two.
280614	285116	I know I am, but we'll talk about that in our gaming weeks in a little bit.
285116	287017	But first, we're going to get to our kickoff topic.
287017	294982	The news, of course, this week has been a little bit lighter, but we have had some pretty major stories, including this first one right off the bat about
296403	304440	this big thing that's happened and very interesting ethical questions coming out of this as well as far as like people reporting on it.
304440	307646	But Loki, why don't you give us like the high level overview and then we'll talk about some of that.
308393	322579	Yeah, so Insomniac Games was recently hit with a ransomware attack, and the folks that were attacking them wanted $2 million in Bitcoin in order for them not to leak their information.
322579	326721	Because Bitcoin is always for legitimate purposes, clearly.
326721	329762	It's supposed to be less traceable or something.
329762	332303	Well, Bitcoin's the official currency of crime.
332303	335785	Like, let's just call it what it is.
335785	336906	Put that tagline on there.
338733	361674	But yes, the hacking group responsible had requested 2 million in Bitcoin to prevent the data from being leaked, which that data included a lot of things, development stuff, there was an early working version of Wolverine, assets, also employee information, data, financial information, planning, all that type of stuff.
362435	362855	Marvel, Insomniac
377846	382347	Thank you for your outpouring of compassion and unwavering support.
382347	383107	It's deeply appreciated.
383107	391669	We're both saddened and angered about the recent criminal cyber attack on the studio and the emotional tale it's taken on our dev team.
404091	410017	We have focused inwardly for the last several days to support each other.
410017	411559	We're aware of the stolen data.
411559	417024	It includes personal information belonging to our employees, former employees, and independent contractors.
417024	422410	It also includes early developmental details about Marvel's Wolverine for PlayStation 5.
422410	426134	We continue working quickly to determine what data was impacted.
426634	439512	And then with that, they're just kind of saying, you know, we want everyone to enjoy the games that we're making, but we want you to also wait for that information to come out as we feel it's ready and necessary.
439512	439752	Yeah.
441618	461841	So kind of like the whole thing I think is to focus like not on covering the leaked information because they feel it's going to you know and this same thing kind of happened with you know Grand Theft Auto 6 and stuff they they want you not to talk about it because one some people get like an impression like oh Wolverine looks terrible right now
462722	471099	Yeah, it's not anywhere near done yet, but you know, there are idiots out there that feel like this is representative of the final game, which it's obviously not.
473428	485415	It just also, it hopefully will dissuade people from trying to attack these companies in this similar type of way in order to, you know, leak information.
485415	491559	If they feel that it's not valuable to do so, then maybe they'll be less likely to do that.
491559	493520	But yeah, it sucks for them.
493520	500004	I mean, at the same time, like, it's fun seeing that stuff in progress, but I guess, you know, it does take a toll on the dev teams if you're
500504	502945	you know, kind of sharing all that leaked information out there.
502945	503485	Yeah, yeah.
503485	506606	But people will do it because of clicks and engagement and clout.
506606	517290	Yes, but also like, you know, I'm kind of on the fence because I feel like there are some people out there that are making, they're going out of their way to let you know, we are not going to cover these leaks.
517290	518810	We are not going to talk about these leaks.
518810	523032	And there's a part of me, I'm sorry, that's not going to be popular, but I'm just going to tell it like it is.
523832	528293	In some cases, and we'll make that very clear, some of that feels very performative.
528293	533274	And the reason why I use that word is because there was no problem when it was Capcom a few weeks ago.
533274	535315	There was no problem when it was Nintendo.
535315	537395	There was no problem when it was the ESA.
537395	538376	There was no problem.
538376	539696	And look, I understand.
539696	547798	So I'm not saying, oh, we need to go over the, you know, I just think here at this show, like, you know, we talk about what people are talking about on social media.
548238	551561	I think to not acknowledge this has happened.
551561	552682	It's out there.
552682	554524	Yes, they're talking about Wolverine.
554524	559107	Yes, they've got these Marvel licenses on games through 2032 and all this stuff.
559107	560509	They've got these different licenses.
560509	561970	I think it's kind of like
563383	569248	It's assuming that people only get their gaming news from this podcast, which I think is a ridiculous notion.
569248	577234	I realize there might be a couple people out there and thank you if that's you, but I think there's a lot of people out there that use social media and they know that this stuff is out there.
577234	580976	Now, look, I also understand that there is personal data in here.
580976	583498	There's people's phone numbers and that shit ain't cool.
583498	589723	And so like, no, we shouldn't talk about where to go find this or how to get the information for yourself and all this stuff.
590403	602308	Yeah, I think we ought to say openly, yes, there is screenshots, there is gameplay of Wolverine out there, and if you think that is what the finished game is going to look like, you are a fool.
602308	603049	Exactly.
603049	614174	If you think that that is representative of what the actual game is going to look like, you are a fool, and should not be commenting on the gaming industry, because you don't know how it works.
614174	616075	That's, and that's that on that.
616075	616515	Period.
616515	617855	Happy holidays.
617855	618096	So,
619723	624107	That's, that's, you know, what it is for the Wolverine.
624107	629532	And as far as the Marvel things go, I mean, look at the pattern.
629532	631733	Insomniac's been making a lot of Marvel games.
631733	633955	Of course, they've been in talks to make more.
633955	638699	Do you think that that timeline is going to hold up and be exact one for one?
638699	639040	Haha!
639827	641128	Absolutely not.
641128	659400	Because if you think and you go out into 2034, or whenever the last game was projected there, we're going to be talking like PlayStation six, and fuck, maybe even PlayStation seven by then I don't maybe not quite, but we're almost on our way to PlayStation seven by then, like, do you think that those things don't change as a part of that?
659400	663303	And based off the sales of other things that of course, that's all going to change.
663303	666765	All of that is projection period.
666765	666825	Um,
668590	680074	as far as the leaks themselves again, I feel like Grand Theft Auto 6 trailer, even despite the fact that it leaked early, which is a whole other thing.
680074	686916	Even despite the fact that that came out early, it's still the talk of the town, all over news media, millions of clicks.
686916	690437	In fact, didn't it break YouTube records and all this stuff too?
690437	695299	So I'm not saying it's okay that it leaked out.
695299	697740	But I am saying it turned out okay.
698160	704381	Gamers are still going to be hyped for the actual real thing and sharing that around and putting it on social media and so forth.
704381	706482	And then that's the stuff to get excited about.
706482	717905	Because then again, you know, when the Grand Theft Auto 6 trailer actually showed up, there were all these things in it that looked really cool that the leaks did not give any presence of because
719813	720713	It just wasn't in there.
720713	721674	It was too early development.
721674	722594	It wasn't polished enough.
722594	726836	We didn't see the TikTok or Instagram lifestyle parody stuff in there.
726836	729578	So we found out there's a female protagonist.
729578	730818	Whoopee!
730818	734000	That's what the leaks gave us.
734000	735381	Context gave us so much more.
736837	739979	SheHulk10 in chat says, I love this comment by the way.
739979	746383	SheHulk10 says, we should be talking about the lack of security and other security failures.
746383	755709	And this is, and I don't want to pick on Insomniac because obviously they are, you know, bearing the brunt of that, but every company should be looking at this.
755709	758871	And to me, this whole situation was exacerbated
759651	781426	when E3 information got leaked a couple years ago by the ESA by the company that's supposed to represent the gaming industry and be on the cutting edge of this stuff, which as we have found, part of the many failures of the ESA is the fact that they are, they're usually behind the curve on this stuff, and behind the curve of where, you know, security and this stuff is.
782679	785081	So something to think about.
785081	788763	Bobby Blackwolf does say though, company stop hacks all the times.
788763	790284	You just don't hear about the ones they stop.
790284	792786	Funny enough, later today, you will hear about one story.
792786	794067	So we do have that coming.
794067	800592	But yes, I mean, there are a lot that are prevented, but there's unfortunately a lot that aren't.
800592	808738	And I think Insomniac may consider being a little bit transparent, especially with peers about how this happened, so that this can be stopped.
809670	810510	I don't know what else to say.
810510	815152	I mean, I'm sure there was more information in the hacks than just like the Marvel licenses and the Wolverine stuff, but it's like
837668	851137	how I mean it's it's all gonna change it's all gonna change you weren't supposed to see it for a reason yeah that's the reality of it so people yeah
851519	852540	Yeah, I know.
852540	853820	But I will say, you know what's funny?
853820	864066	Yes, I did see the Wolverine footage because occasionally I get directed to Twitter and I see related tweets and so I try to avoid that site, but it's just unfortunately it still is a news platform.
864066	868448	You unfortunately, if you're not checking it, you're not seeing some of the news.
869008	870809	So I'll get linked to tweets occasionally.
870809	873450	And I did come across some of the the I think it was screenshots.
873450	874371	I don't think there was video.
874371	875651	Maybe there was I don't remember.
875651	876352	Screenshots were great.
876352	881094	And I will say for as early on as it is since that game, that game isn't out till like 2025.
881094	881574	Right?
881574	886376	So as early on as it is, from my perspective, it looks great.
886376	890418	I'm like, I think it's gonna be a kick ass game, actually.
890418	894460	So but it's early so much can change, right?
894460	897902	So pretty much everything that's been seen out there probably going to change.
898587	900618	So, whatever, whatever.
903075	911459	Interesting though, I will say some voice actor information was also part of the leaks and that information and like who's involved and all that stuff.
911459	914380	Yeah.
914380	916961	I will just say because people are talking about it and spreading it.
916961	917862	I just thought it was interesting.
917862	920183	Deborah Wilson's in it again.
920183	924005	If the leaks are to be believed and things have not changed, etc, etc.
924005	928687	If Deborah Wilson's apparently in it again, and I just love her.
930984	933229	I can't think of her without thinking about MADtv.
937461	965847	and maybe you know and that that could be a bummer because maybe you know again this was something that insomniac wanted to release on their own terms and talk about the voice cast so forth but it does there's plenty of other people too in there that I'm sure they'll announce at some point that didn't catch my eye as much but I was like oh I just love her they they should what with movies you know who's in the movie before they even start shooting why not tell us a little bit about who's on board for the games I don't know all right
967034	974280	Anyway, let's get into our gaming weeks and talk about the types of games that we have been playing this so what's that Jamie?
976830	981134	excited for when the game comes out because things are looking so positive.
981134	984696	Honestly, if the early build is looking so good.
984696	990941	Yeah, I mean, it's honestly I haven't gotten into a lot of the superhero insomniac games.
990941	992062	It's not that I'm a hater.
992062	993583	It's just the game's backlog.
993583	997466	I always mean to play those Spider-Man games because they look incredible.
997466	999628	But yeah, I just never get around to it.
999628	1001910	So I want to check out Wolverine.
1001910	1002130	But
1002881	1005803	You know, gaming backlog, it never ends.
1005803	1012588	Anyway, let's see what we've been attacking in our gaming backlog this week, if anything, in a segment we call How Was Your Gaming Week?
1012588	1018912	So we'll go to DarkSakura and ask How Was Your Gaming Week?
1018912	1021814	Hi Daylight, and Disney Dreamlight Valley.
1022717	1029125	and RudraNulhiho, which I'm on the second scenario now.
1029125	1032289	I played some Weird Al pinball, because of course I did.
1036385	1037966	I'd say that's about it.
1037966	1045132	I've actually do you know the I think it's called the watermelon game or something.
1045132	1051156	But there's a version for Mac called fruit salad, and I'm going to be giving that a try.
1051156	1053218	Maybe today we'll see.
1053218	1054599	Mike def says Suica game.
1054599	1057741	Yes, I've seen Alan play a mobile phone version because you know, like
1058782	1059183	64 Clones
1078547	1086450	But yes, you know how the popular games clones show up everywhere, especially the one, unfortunately, it's the ones that are easy to clone.
1086450	1091632	And I would consider Suika games probably one of those, you know, it's probably not incredibly difficult to clone.
1091632	1096374	Flappy Bird's a great example, too.
1096374	1096874	Mm hmm.
1096874	1097995	Yeah.
1097995	1098655	All right.
1098655	1101316	Um, well, let's go to Loki.
1101316	1102377	Okay, let's go to Loki.
1102377	1103017	How was your gaming week?
1104218	1112292	Is all minecraft for the most part I think I think it played a little bit on the playdate we had a couple I up my
1114664	1117745	where my progress was in the season, so it unlocked more games.
1117745	1120145	So I played Executive Golf, which is kind of fun.
1120145	1130868	It's like a 2D golf game that you have to go up and down floors and knock your golf ball over all this different office furniture and stuff.
1130868	1132128	So it's a little different.
1132128	1141210	I played that, and then there was a time traveler crank game that was kind of hard that I ended up playing as well on the play date.
1141990	1143831	But other than that, it's been mostly Minecraft.
1143831	1147893	I've been working on, well, procrastinating a lot.
1147893	1153136	I built a few farms and I muddled a raccoon for the upcoming...
1155165	1156606	theme park ride they're building.
1156606	1161970	So I modeled that in Blockbench for adding some stuff in the game.
1161970	1177580	Because the premise of the first ride that I'm doing is supposed to be that you're in a log flume ride and you are going around trying to capture raccoons that have infested a lumber yard.
1177580	1178801	Like a lumber mill, I guess.
1178801	1180182	Less of a lumber yard.
1180182	1180622	Lumber mill.
1181462	1185806	And it's all kind of like target shooting type of stuff.
1185806	1195333	And they get captured, but then of course, you know, whatever you capture in game or whatever you shoot at the end, it scores you and then there's going to be like a leaderboard and stuff like that.
1196109	1212242	So it'll be very involved, which is why it's taken so long to get an actual episode out from Channel 64, because I'm still in that mindset of like, I want to finish these big projects in one episode, and it really isn't feasible to do that, and I don't know how to split them up yet.
1213122	1214764	But still kind of early in the planning phase.
1214764	1219587	I think I'll put like an interim episode out kind of discussing that whole planning process.
1219587	1220468	I think that might be good.
1220468	1224391	But I did put out one, the third episode of the Razeworks server.
1224391	1228134	And then I have the fourth one mostly done already.
1228134	1233958	I just need to film a few things and then that'll be out probably next week or so.
1233958	1235539	So yeah, I've been busy.
1235539	1238822	Just a lot of different stuff in game.
1241026	1254753	MikeyMuWeek has been a little bit of a hodgepodge of different stuff, still playing Diablo 4, still playing World of Warcraft Season of Discovery, although I think I might have about hit my limit there on Season of Discovery, because now I'm like, I'm not really interested in raiding.
1254753	1263497	I joined an LGBTQIA guild that was shouting in trade chat in the game, and they're all like, but I forgot about how much I don't enjoy the whole like,
1264297	1273765	And they're great, don't get me wrong, but it's the whole, like, we gotta get a group together for Saturday, and it's gonna be at this time, server time, we gotta prepare all the potions and all this stuff, and I'm just like, eh, that's the part I don't miss.
1273765	1287135	I don't need to do the organized raiding, because I just, I don't, I, maybe it's because I'm older, I just don't like to commit that kind of time to that sort of stuff, so, but I like, I like signing in, but I just kind of feel like I'm running out of things to do now with level cap, because I'm not interested in raiding.
1287135	1291599	There's, there's doing alts, and that's about it, and even alt stuff is kind of getting old.
1292119	1299683	But it's also one of those things where I think the break has been good because now I'm like, oh, I really need to go back and finish where I was in Final Fantasy XIV.
1299683	1306626	And I think it's been like a little bit of a palate cleanser going back to WoW and kind of like, you know, remembering the game I played a long time ago.
1306626	1313830	And now it's like, OK, now I need to go back and during this kind of lull in Final Fantasy XIV, go back and finish the content I hadn't done yet.
1313830	1316371	You know, I kind of have a taste for it again after doing other stuff.
1316371	1317431	So we'll see.
1318672	1319453	Fortnite Fortnite Festival
1338830	1365669	uh another song so there's there's these interesting like new songs are showing up on thursday so i wonder if they aren't at injecting more stuff into the rotation every thursday to try to give this some longevity uh we'll see but um i still think 500 v bucks is a disgusting price to charge for the songs there's no fucking way i'm gonna pay it so if the song's not in the free rotation or a giveaway there was a really silly epic original song about winter
1366874	1368195	WinterWonderFest
1386650	1391135	YouTube channel, however, is a unique name because my Rob Roberts was taken already.
1391135	1394980	Unfortunately, there's a few people in media who use the same name.
1394980	1399485	So Rob Roberts Plays, P-L-A-Y-S is my YouTube channel, Rob Roberts Plays.
1401306	1405050	I did also play a little more Lego Fortnite as well, that's still fun.
1405050	1408814	So yeah, I'm happy that there's more games than just Battle Royale.
1408814	1411076	But I've been playing other stuff too that's not that.
1411076	1412357	This is gonna be so random.
1412357	1413478	Y'all are gonna be like, what the fuck?
1413478	1415040	Why did Rob start playing that?
1415040	1417783	I played a game called Remnant 2.
1417783	1418583	You know what this game is?
1419482	1424385	There was a game called Remnant from the Ashes, and then Remnant 2 just came out over the summer.
1424385	1431288	Well, it's on Game Pass, and a friend of mine, same friend that likes to play Overwatch with me, was like, you should get this game, Rob.
1431288	1433029	It's like Diablo, but it's like a shooter.
1433029	1434770	And I was like, OK, you had me at Diablo.
1434770	1436131	I'm going to check it out.
1436131	1439773	Well, the party left out was that it's like Dark Souls meets Diablo.
1441491	1441911	DarkSakura
1460996	1477180	You could change the classes on demand a little more easy because now I'm going to have to play the intro segment again, in order to switch to like a medic, which might be a good idea because then I'd have a ton of heals or a gunner so I could I assume assume hit people more long distance, because right now I'm a
1478840	1481521	I don't know, but the equivalent of a warrior.
1481521	1487724	I basically, I have a tin can on my head and a giant sword and I slash at people but they down me in like one hit.
1487724	1492887	And even though I was trying to play myself on what is supposedly Bobby Blackwolf mode, uh-uh.
1492887	1495628	This is still like a Dark Souls kind of game.
1495628	1497189	So, yeah, I don't know.
1497189	1497629	We'll see.
1497629	1502572	I'm gonna give it another try but I'm just feeling this game might be too difficult for me and that's okay.
1502572	1502812	I mean...
1503812	1508436	I'm not usually a fan of the souls kind of games, but my husband loves that stuff.
1508436	1510157	So, you know, there's an audience for it.
1510157	1511719	We'll see.
1511719	1516302	Waynein12 in chat, hi, thanks for listening, says, I played the first Remnant.
1516302	1519585	It became very frustrating, especially the bosses and their adds.
1519585	1521486	Yeah, it's not an easy game.
1521486	1522127	But you know what?
1522127	1526751	Some people love that bang their head on the wall kind of difficulty.
1526751	1528072	And so like this,
1529281	1536944	Taking that and mixing it with procedural generation, I understand why somebody told me, like, you should try playing this game, and why there's an audience for it.
1536944	1542647	And I can totally recognize sometimes, there is an audience for this game, that audience is not me.
1542647	1544347	It's like movies, sometimes.
1544347	1547369	There is an audience for Terrifier 2.
1547369	1549990	That audience is not me.
1549990	1550730	It's that simple.
1553604	1558667	Let's see, but I also played, this is very random, but I was like, you know what?
1558667	1561649	I bought those Final Fantasy Pixel remasters.
1561649	1565691	I got a platinum trophy on Final Fantasy 1, I actually streamed that whole thing.
1565691	1569313	But I never played any other Final Fantasy game after that, and I was like, I gotta fix this.
1569313	1570554	You know what my hang-up has been?
1571414	1573374	I don't want to play Final Fantasy 2.
1573374	1577675	I just, like, Final Fantasy 2 is, like, pretty much the worst Final Fantasy game.
1577675	1593619	I don't, y'all know I don't like 8 either, but Final Fantasy 2, it, I, people want to fight me over Final Fantasy 8, but if I were to sit here and say Final Fantasy 2, and remember, this is Japanese NES 2, if I were to say Final Fantasy 2 is the worst Final Fantasy game,
1594099	1596224	I don't think a lot of people would pick a fight.
1596224	1600032	I think most people would say, yeah, that game's in the bottom three, at least.
1600032	1603018	Like, Final Fantasy II is kind of the worst one.
1603018	1603860	I don't even remember II.
1605003	1606444	It had challenges.
1606444	1607705	Yeah, it will.
1607705	1609546	It had challenges.
1609546	1611168	Three was awesome, though.
1611168	1613670	It was the same reason I don't care for eight.
1613670	1615631	It's kind of a broken system.
1615631	1616632	For me, it's broken.
1616632	1622516	And what I mean by that is that it's the whole leveling up through taking damage and using things over and over again.
1622516	1624137	I think they took some of that idea.
1624137	1629722	And funny enough, 11 institutes a lot of that same skill up sort of concept, but it's much better in 11.
1630402	1631083	in my opinion.
1631083	1633926	So yeah, it's just, you know, I'll go play it someday.
1633926	1640232	But Jamie, funny enough, since you bring that up, I said, you know what, why am I sitting here going, you must play Final Fantasy 2?
1640232	1641334	Fuck that noise.
1641334	1642355	I make the rules.
1642355	1643196	It's Christmas.
1643196	1644377	I'm gonna do what I want.
1644377	1647520	So I played Final Fantasy 3 NES.
1647520	1650243	And I will fully admit, I've used- Which he knows is one of my favorites.
1650243	1651104	Yeah, and actually, and
1652265	1654507	Admittedly, I've only played a little bit of it.
1654507	1661832	I played, I always call it the OUYA version, but it was actually the DS version, the one that went 3D, but you know, it was on the OUYA.
1661832	1666196	I played a little bit of that, but not enough.
1666196	1670239	But this one, I'm already further in this one than I ever got in the OUYA version of Final Fantasy III.
1671139	1695984	um and so i'm up to i think i'm about to go get the fire crystal finally which it actually takes quite some time in that game to get through a sequence of events before you're about to go get the next crystal which unlocks new jobs which is a big part of that game but i will also fully admit i'm using a guide to help me get a platinum trophy and it's basically a guide that just says don't miss this treasure chest make sure you get these beastiary things because
1696744	1701348	There are certain bestiary things where if you don't get them, you won't get the Platinum Trophy.
1701348	1705713	Like one of them is like this water dragon that's blocking a channel.
1705713	1720867	You don't have to beat him, in fact you really can't, but you have to encounter him and run to get the bestiary, and if you don't do that before you clear the level that then gets rid of him so you can get through in the water channel, you're fucked for a Platinum Trophy.
1721147	1722868	So I'm using a guide for that reason.
1722868	1725889	So I don't have to go back and play it over and over again.
1725889	1728570	Um, but I'm enjoying Fallout Fantasy 3.
1728570	1729830	I know, I know you love it.
1729830	1732351	But I want it after after I'm done with it.
1732351	1736872	No, I'm saying that there's no problem with having to use a guide.
1736872	1737693	Oh, yeah, no, no.
1737693	1744275	I Yeah, yeah, we were just talking about this on the Bobby show a little bit is that especially in the NES era, like
1745405	1746925	We had manuals.
1746925	1748426	We had guides.
1748426	1749626	We had things to help us.
1749626	1751526	We also did have printed user guides.
1751526	1752086	That's right.
1752086	1752406	Absolutely.
1752406	1752706	Yeah.
1752706	1755287	And then we had Nintendo Fun Club and Nintendo Power.
1755287	1770349	That's how we had a Zelda map, because people today, we were just talking about this on Bobby Show, but, you know, kids today or people who just, you know, don't know for whatever reason, don't realize that like when they say, well, in The Legend of Zelda, you just had to figure out what to do.
1770349	1771710	You just got dropped in there.
1771710	1772770	Oh, gosh, she did.
1772770	1773030	Yeah.
1774050	1781936	We had a 900 number that we could call to ask people at Nintendo to rank up our grandmother's bills.
1781936	1787679	Read the last 10 pages of the manual because it walks you through like the first three levels of Zelda.
1787679	1789901	So it's right there.
1789901	1791462	If you need to figure out... You know what?
1791462	1794544	If we had the internet then, we would have totally used it.
1794544	1795464	Absolutely.
1795464	1796045	Absolutely.
1796565	1800368	So anyway, I am playing Final Fantasy III, and I am enjoying it.
1800368	1801468	I'm using the boosts.
1801468	1802529	I don't care.
1802529	1804771	I'm having fun.
1804771	1815238	You actually really do have to think about, like, okay, if I use a red mage, so I have warrior, monk, red mage, white mage, because keep in mind, I only have the base jobs right now.
1815238	1817639	I'm just before I get the second set of jobs.
1817639	1824884	So I went for red mage instead of black mage, which I think is actually easier in the beginning, because, you know, you get a little bit of the oomph there.
1824884	1825205	But
1825905	1835074	There is actually some really challenging shit because you have, in the beginning of the game, because you have done, I actually understand why they didn't bring this out in America now.
1835074	1840900	Now that I'm really sitting down and playing this in depth, I'm like, oh, oh, people would have never figured out.
1841380	1851987	You have to cast mini on your whole party to find the town and then go through the dungeon as mini, which means you can only cast spells you can't fight.
1851987	1862514	So you ought to think about switching your entire party to black mages before you, well, three black mages and a white mage before you go mini so that you have the firepower and then you have to mix up your spells.
1862514	1865957	There's actually a lot of fun logic puzzles in a way to think about with it.
1865957	1866117	What?
1868078	1875585	There's also stuff like that in Final Fantasy V, which also didn't get released originally in the US.
1875585	1886215	There's the whole point that you have to do that for reaching certain elvish creatures and then you've got to do other puzzles similar to that in the Moogle Village and yeah.
1887642	1891664	And then Final Fantasy 4 literally dumbed down for America.
1891664	1899528	Which I'm sure most people know that at this point, but we actually had what they ended up re-releasing in Japan as Final Fantasy 4 Easy Type.
1899528	1903269	Is the actual Final Fantasy 2 US.
1903269	1908372	So, because they um... I played through the original on my channel, remember?
1908652	1909252	Yeah, I do.
1909252	1909513	I do.
1909513	1914316	It's and it's, yeah, and well, and now the pixel remasters and all that they emulate the original.
1914316	1920159	They don't, you know, Easy Type is just a Ted Woosley memory in our heart, apparently at this point.
1920159	1924162	But it's, it's, uh, and all the translation issues.
1924162	1925823	Yes, yes.
1925823	1930186	Some of that, though, not all of that is the translator.
1930186	1935269	Because like things like the Holy Spell being renamed, that wasn't it called White?
1936320	1938341	in the original.
1938341	1940322	Pearl, maybe, was what they called it.
1940322	1945225	But they had to change the name because you couldn't say holy in a Nintendo game.
1945225	1948167	That was unholy to say holy.
1948167	1948387	Anyway.
1950577	1954681	Anyway, Final Fantasy tangent, but I'm enjoying three the pixel remaster.
1954681	1968912	So if you are where I'm at, and you are saying, I want to be all of the pixel remasters, and I played one, I don't want to play two, I want to give you permission to do what I did and give your let yourself give yourself a just skip to just skip it.
1968912	1970314	You can always come back to it later.
1970834	1975737	just skip it, enjoy three, enjoy four, five, six, and then there you go.
1975737	1977358	That's so that's my plan.
1977358	1980961	I will probably stream four and not use a guide.
1980961	1987765	Because four is one where it's like if I have to play that a second time to get everything I actually don't care as much.
1987765	1992428	So four and six I'll probably stream because I could play those forever.
1992428	1993909	I like three and five though.
1993909	1997191	Like I don't I don't know why I played through five.
1997191	1999953	Yes, well, I don't think I actually beat it.
2001758	2003638	I think I got like very very far.
2033075	2034556	Hey, and I'll throw this out there.
2034556	2039339	You might actually super enjoy Rura no Hiho.
2039339	2041640	I've got a translation of it.
2041640	2043281	It's really fun.
2043281	2045062	I think it would be right up your alley.
2046449	2056078	I wonder if Square Enix might think about that as a re-release later in the same style as Live Alive.
2056078	2057279	Did you play through Live Alive?
2057279	2061663	No, but I want to get the redone one.
2061663	2066007	Live Alive is... I want the redone version and Seiken 3.
2066007	2067529	Yeah.
2067529	2068129	Yeah.
2070091	2075457	Those are, I'm so glad I played those because they were so much fun.
2075457	2083046	Although I'm pretty much going to be going back to, I think I'm going to do either Star Ocean original or Emerald Dragon next.
2083046	2084127	I haven't decided.
2084127	2087832	But I'm loving this Square Enix going back and bringing out like the
2088252	2095034	I'm using my quotey fingers, obscure to us JRPGs now in this new engine that they've been doing in the past couple years.
2095034	2104637	I think ever since they realized they could use the engine they made for, you know, Octopath Traveler and Triangle Strategy and all this stuff, like they can use that engine to remake old games too.
2104637	2105898	And it's great.
2105898	2109359	So I hope they keep it going and bring us other games.
2109359	2109619	We'll see.
2111713	2118215	I really, I would, I would petition them to bring Rudran Elhiho out.
2118215	2123337	Especially with the such unique magic system in there.
2123337	2126457	With the, with the mantras and all that.
2126457	2129798	Well, they might be working on Chrono Trigger though.
2129798	2135260	That's the popular rumor is that they're finally going to give us what we fucking want and give us Chrono Trigger in that engine.
2135260	2137501	How many more endings are they going to add to it?
2137501	2141082	Ooh, that's actually, that's legit, legit a good question.
2142261	2144942	Well, with the PlayStation ones, they added more endings.
2144942	2146382	Yeah, we should get more endings.
2146382	2153603	Dan and I have played through eight of the endings together, nine, something like that.
2153603	2154703	We did a bunch of them.
2154703	2156104	I want a dog ending.
2156104	2157064	That'd be great.
2157064	2162345	And then I want a Wayne's... Woof, woof, woof, woof, woof, woof, woof, woof, woof, woof, woof.
2162345	2168986	I want a Wayne's World mega happy ending as well.
2168986	2169186	Yeah.
2170026	2171267	I love you, Goth.
2171267	2175309	I love you, Dream Woman.
2175309	2176290	I want to watch that again.
2176290	2176630	I know.
2176630	2177711	I need to watch Wayne's World.
2177711	2179752	I was going to say and Wayne's World 2, but not really.
2179752	2181753	Wayne's World 2 was not nearly as good.
2181753	2183955	So even if I had Christopher Walken.
2183955	2184635	Moments.
2184635	2187777	But yeah, Wayne's World was.
2187777	2189818	Peak 90s cinema.
2189818	2192720	Peak 90s cinema.
2192720	2193341	Anyway.
2193341	2194021	All right.
2194021	2194721	Yeah.
2194721	2196342	Well, I mean, you know, my other favorite 90s movie.
2197711	2200732	which is completely on a different direction as pump up the volume.
2200732	2204093	Showgirls.
2204093	2205714	You don't know shit.
2205714	2207655	All right.
2207655	2208495	Let's move on.
2208495	2212357	You know, the last time I saw that was at the Peaches Christ Midnight Mass.
2212357	2213077	That was a while ago.
2213077	2217038	She ended that a while ago, but I think that was last time I saw it, too, to be honest.
2217038	2221160	We watched it at your house one one.
2221160	2226382	Didn't we watch it at your house one Christmas with, you know, the girl we don't hang out with anymore?
2226382	2226602	Yeah.
2228502	2230242	So yeah, yeah, yeah.
2230242	2231683	I feel like that was the last time I saw it.
2231683	2232783	Yeah, her.
2232783	2234183	So anyway.
2234183	2234883	All right.
2234883	2235924	Yeah.
2235924	2237844	Let's get into some gaming news.
2237844	2241145	Oh God, no Skitsaberry.
2241145	2243125	Pump up the show, girl.
2243125	2246186	Let's talk about some of the other things that have been going on in gaming this week.
2246186	2255688	Not that there's a ton of stuff, but there's still a few things here and there, such as what ought to happen to these leakers and folks that release information early, right?
2255688	2256828	Loki, accountability.
2257208	2259429	Well, yeah, accountability.
2259429	2266533	I don't necessarily agree with the life sentence, but apparently the hacker.
2266533	2268974	Well, I understand the reasoning for it.
2268974	2284283	So like basically the hacker that was responsible for the Grand Theft Auto 6 leak, which was only 18, basically has been he's been sentenced to life in a hospital prison.
2285645	2290530	and can only be released if Dr. Society is no longer a danger to others.
2290530	2299679	Probably because the guy that was sentenced to that said that as soon as I get out, I'm going to do this again and again and again and again.
2299679	2302622	So they're like, well, you can't.
2305274	2312957	Continue to express the intent to return to cybercrime as soon as possible, calling him highly motivated.
2312957	2318900	Also claimed that he was violent while held in custody for the trial.
2318900	2321481	So he's got mental issues, probably.
2323396	2337219	So yeah, I hope that this is appropriate for the crime and not because Rockstar Games is a big company and so they pressured the court systems to make an example of this person type of thing.
2337219	2341280	Well, him admitting some of those things is not a great look either.
2341280	2344301	Like if you literally say, don't let me out of here, I'll do it again.
2346188	2346428	and Matt.
2363516	2376901	Alright, well, I wonder though, maybe I've watched too many Netflix shows, but do you think this guy knows the people that just did the insomniac thing?
2377827	2383152	Do you think that this guy could like rat on the Insomniac people?
2383152	2384974	No, I don't think so.
2384974	2388157	Okay, I guess I watch too much TV dramas.
2388157	2389798	The hackers don't all know each other.
2389798	2391760	This isn't like a big hacking network.
2391760	2397986	I mean, they have individual like groups, but they're not all like, hey, welcome to hack.
2397986	2399468	I mean, I guess they do have hacker cons.
2401469	2402791	Thank you for watching!
2421810	2422991	Yeah, I don't think that they have it.
2422991	2429715	Well, Bobby Blackoaf also points out, and this is just so, you know, any person that attends these cons listenings understands, we do get it.
2429715	2434137	Bobby Blackoaf points out DEF CON is like a white hat hacker con.
2434137	2434377	Right.
2434377	2436419	There are no black hat hacker cons.
2436419	2443863	And of course, white hat means hacking for good, security prevention or, you know, those those sorts of things, not security.
2443863	2444883	You know what I mean?
2444883	2445784	Or a challenge.
2445784	2446564	Exactly.
2446564	2448886	Or for fun, but not hurting anybody.
2449546	2455610	You know, when someone says that their console is unhackable and then- Putting Linux on a toaster.
2455610	2458952	That doesn't prevent people from, you know, figuring out how to do that stuff.
2458952	2461293	What have I started?
2461293	2462594	All right.
2462594	2463894	Anyhow.
2463894	2467296	You know, I hear all this talk about putting Linux on a toaster.
2467296	2469337	Why not Linux on toast?
2469337	2470978	I've been waiting for that.
2470978	2472359	Come on.
2472359	2473320	Maybe at next year's DevCon.
2475427	2480892	Well, don't they have like those little toaster printer things that you could do like Hello Kitty or something?
2480892	2482093	Just put the penguin on it.
2482093	2483735	Yes.
2483735	2487058	And then you have the Linux logo on toast.
2487058	2489981	One step closer.
2489981	2495906	It's basically the equivalent of when computers ran on punch cards, except the punch card is a piece of bread.
2495906	2497788	That's that's where we're moving to.
2497788	2499569	I have a story about punch cards, Rob.
2499569	2500450	OK, why not?
2500450	2501091	It's the holidays.
2502958	2517041	One of my friends was a Fortran programmer in the 70s and had a bunch of punch cards left over from, you know, programming stuff and turned them into lampshades.
2517041	2517741	I can see that.
2517741	2518241	I can see that.
2518241	2519101	That's fun.
2519101	2523562	Laminated them and made them into lampshades.
2523562	2524563	You know what, though?
2524563	2525003	That's art.
2525003	2526323	This is the same person that also
2528122	2528703	That's art.
2528703	2529603	People would pay money for that.
2529603	2537068	This is the same person that also took the 11 inch floppies and made storage containers out of them.
2537068	2538429	It's just, it's recycling.
2538429	2540951	Yes, floppies came that big, kids.
2540951	2541912	It's just recycling.
2541912	2543833	Floppies were the size of your head.
2545828	2547068	All right.
2547068	2552810	Um, anyway, let's move on and talk about Oh, a really feel good story for the holidays.
2552810	2556310	You know, since you know, we are taping this show on Christmas Eve.
2556310	2566573	You know, Merry Christmas, Merry whatever you celebrate, because we just got news that Bobby Kotick will be leaving Activision Blizzard two days earlier than expected.
2566573	2573475	And so by the time you know what, this is the last Orange Lounge Radio, where Bobby Kotick is in the gaming industry.
2573475	2574695	And doesn't that feel good, y'all?
2575475	2579117	because Bobby Kotick will be a thing of the past after December 29th.
2579117	2588182	He has been a toxic person in this industry for 32 years and to which we say, don't let the door hit you in the big fat ass on the way out.
2588182	2590383	Okay, so goodbye.
2590383	2590984	Yeah.
2592284	2592845	December 29, 2023
2610509	2612850	Go back to last week's show if you would like to listen to that.
2612850	2619655	We all know it's not going to happen, but I can still wish, I can still wish upon a star because it is that season.
2619655	2626639	They are letting folks know at Activision though, with the departure, they're letting people know about some other people that are leaving as well.
2626639	2633423	And then for most folks, and they say in this email from Phil Spencer to Activision, your day-to-day work will remain the same.
2633423	2637946	It's still business as usual in bringing more groundbreaking experiences to more players around the world.
2638386	2651471	At the leadership level, these changes will provide the clarity and accountability that is necessary to achieve our ambitious goals and foster a culture that is welcoming, empowering, and committed to gaming for everyone.
2651471	2653672	I am your God now, Phil Spencer.
2655001	2655662	and Bobby Kotick.
2676905	2689215	I'm assuming that Bobby Kotick is getting out of the industry two days early because he needs that extra time to flee the country after the news has come out that, you know, whose lists are going to be released by the government in January.
2689215	2692798	And, you know, if if.
2692798	2700163	Allegedly, if a person's name was maybe too in tied with those lists.
2700163	2704847	I might want to be really far away when that comes out.
2707479	2708479	Yep.
2708479	2713580	So Sia Tabiri says insert toxic violin stinger here.
2713580	2718101	I can raise that one level.
2718101	2720242	Oh, it's cutting in and out, but I could.
2720242	2720602	I heard.
2720602	2721182	Oh, sorry.
2721182	2722142	It was the shade.
2722142	2723763	I could hear just part of the shade.
2723763	2724743	Shade rattle in there.
2724743	2726283	Yes.
2726283	2730684	Yeah, that that that I think is is appropriate.
2730684	2732144	So.
2732144	2733265	All right.
2733265	2734305	DarkSakura, what do you have for us?
2736259	2743707	Well, um, we have some Silent Hill 2 news.
2743707	2756301	So, basically, um, we have, uh, Bloober Team is developing a game, uh, with, uh, Skybound Entertainment, it looks like.
2758948	2774311	There are a number of things actually on the list, but they are working on Silent Hill 2 right now, and it looks like that's one of the games they may be working on with them.
2776213	2783099	Now, they're also, though, on the list of things that Skybound is known for.
2783099	2786962	I mean, that's Walking Dead, you know?
2786962	2793567	So they've got a pretty decent track record, I think.
2793567	2802094	On top of that, though, I mean, if we can get a Silent Hill 2 that is
2804005	2807327	I'm trying to think of a tactful way to say this.
2807327	2809889	Acceptable.
2809889	2811770	No, no, no, not acceptable.
2811770	2815752	I'm thinking of exceptional.
2815752	2818214	I want an exceptional Silent Hill 2.
2818214	2823477	Of course, I would have also liked a Silent Hill 3, hint, hint, nudge, nudge.
2823477	2825598	But I think that
2828240	2829141	It could be great.
2829141	2844683	Now, the other thing too, though, is that Blooper is also going to be developing a game that's based off of one of Skybound's IPs, and so that's where there's speculation about Walking Dead, but we don't exactly know which one it is.
2847574	2854960	Could be interesting if it goes that way, towards Walking Dead, because Walking Dead's kind of had a mixed reception on consoles.
2854960	2860045	The Telltale games are pretty much accepted as some of the greatest games that were made.
2860045	2875077	But there were some shooty games as well that were the opposite of that, and more along the lines of the reception of Gollum, Lord of the Rings, or whatever the fuck that King Kong game was that they made in a year that's very obvious.
2876558	2889220	So so hopefully if Silent Hill 2 is good because bloopers had a little bit of it There's some hits some misses So as long as like DarkSakura said it's on the hit side of things.
2889220	2890781	This could be very exciting.
2890781	2897222	So we'll see I'm really Fingers crossed.
2897222	2904183	Oh, and by the way, it was denied that there's any sort of pyramid head origin story happening Oh, that's good
2905885	2905905	I
2930090	2944016	Um, so one, we're kind of speculating, like, what's the next Zelda game going to be, obviously, because they've said that they're not going to be doing any more in that whole Breath of the Wild, Tears of the Kingdom universe.
2944016	2946957	It's going to be a brand new thing that comes out whenever
2947657	2947817	Zelda
2964509	2968632	Not a lot of people have enough creativity to be able to do that.
2968632	2974237	They said, when we're creating games like Tears of the Kingdom, I think it's important that we don't make creativity a requirement.
2974237	2981783	Instead, we put things into the game that encourage people to be creative and give them the opportunity to be creative without forcing them to.
2981783	2986327	So apparently, forcing people to be creative is not the thing.
2986327	2987487	But to that I say,
2988814	2990035	then don't buy the game.
2990035	2994778	Like if you knew it was a game where you're just creating levels, that's its own thing.
2994778	2995959	It's like Mario Maker.
2995959	2998661	I don't go to Mario Maker thinking that's a brand new Mario game.
2998661	3003704	I think of it as a game I can make Mario games or levels in.
3003704	3004004	Right.
3004004	3006486	So that seems like a bad excuse.
3006486	3012330	Besides, I think they have like a dungeon creator type thing in the Link's Awakening remake.
3012330	3014352	So.
3014352	3016093	It's not entirely true.
3016093	3016293	Yeah.
3017535	3018976	Um, we'll see.
3018976	3026999	We'll see what I was just thinking, though, that I saw the you talk about create creativity and, you know, tears, the kingdom, I saw the funniest video.
3026999	3030241	It was somebody created this contraption and what they did.
3030241	3034322	So link picks up a chicken and throws it into a box.
3034322	3037784	So the box is there and there's all these lasers above the box.
3037784	3039945	So when the chicken lands in the box, the lasers go.
3041205	3062022	and start like covering the box and then there's a little conveyor belt outside the box and after the lasers go out pops after like 10 seconds a little roasted chicken comes out the conveyor belts and it's like a four-star roasted chicken in a microwave it's it's literally a chicken murdering machine that just like awesome
3065187	3066848	I need to do this.
3066848	3068610	I mean, la la la la la.
3068610	3072753	It reminds me of the whole like, what part of the chicken is the McNugget on?
3072753	3077156	It's like, yes, the chicken just turns into a roasted chicken.
3077156	3078937	It's brilliant.
3078937	3081619	Anyway.
3081619	3086883	That is that's, I mean, and that's why maybe we don't need a Zelda maker, right?
3086883	3093107	Because these games end up being the makers and you can make horrific things to your heart's content in these games.
3093107	3093588	And it's fun.
3094878	3097242	Alright, I wonder what that machine does to people, though.
3097242	3100827	Can you pick up, or I guess- It's made of people!
3100827	3102410	H-Bokoblin!
3102410	3108239	I guess you can't pick up people and throw them into the box, but at least maybe a Moblin or something?
3108239	3109701	I don't know.
3109701	3110002	Alright.
3111317	3112398	Let's move on.
3112398	3114580	Oh my god, this news is epic.
3114580	3115260	I'm sorry.
3115260	3117282	This is some this is amazing.
3117282	3124388	And people were talking about this in our discord server this week over at vognetwork.com slash discord and I was like, what for real?
3124388	3126770	Okay, so here's the deal.
3126770	3127291	Who knew?
3128031	3129231	Alien Resurrection.
3129231	3130952	That's right, the fourth Alien movie.
3130952	3133853	Who knew this was going to be so important all these years later?
3133853	3146476	Because the game, based off the Sigourney Weaver and Winona Ryder starring film, has been unveiled this week to contain the ultimate cheat code.
3146476	3155098	So this game came out in 2000, Alien Resurrection, and it was pretty much towards the end of the PlayStation's lifespan, because PS2 came out in 2001.
3158833	3165575	Argonaut was the studio that made the game and they had previously worked on things like Star Fox and Star Glider.
3165575	3168356	So, you know, they worked at this.
3168356	3174518	And a cheat code has been unveiled this week by a former Argonaut staffer, Martin Piper.
3174518	3184041	He revealed that the game contains a hidden cheat mode that allows you to play a bootleg game on your PlayStation without the need for an internal mod chip.
3186328	3187129	That's right.
3187129	3193113	It allows you to just open the lid, do a disc swap, put the new game in and go to town.
3193113	3193733	You don't need it.
3193733	3197936	You don't need one of the cartridge slots in the back, like what I used to have.
3197936	3200037	Jamie was the one that taught me how to do that, by the way.
3200037	3201798	You don't need a paper clip.
3201798	3202859	You don't need any of that stuff.
3202859	3204380	Paperclip was the original way.
3204380	3204860	Yeah.
3204860	3208163	You just, it's been hidden for 23 years.
3208163	3214067	It says you still have to put a piece of card to keep the lid, the sensor open.
3214067	3214667	So you can't.
3215267	3218130	You will still need a paperclip.
3236022	3237143	Unnoticed ever.
3237143	3241445	He was basically like, I'm trying to find the quote that he said, but he was basically, oh, here it is.
3241445	3250010	I figured it was so long ago and that I didn't want to get old and die without letting go of these kinds of secrets.
3250010	3251951	What a hero, honestly.
3251951	3262297	And yeah, he, he just wanted this whole thing went unnoticed because he wanted to find out if this could be changed without having to reset the PS1.
3262297	3264038	He didn't tell any of the other developers.
3264478	3266641	He didn't tell Sony himself.
3266641	3267842	He didn't tell anybody else about this test.
3267842	3271146	Because you're supposed to report to Sony when these games go through certification.
3271146	3273449	Here's all the cheat codes and here's what they do.
3273449	3276573	But he didn't submit this one in that.
3276573	3277234	So.
3277234	3279396	Well, bless him.
3279396	3280818	He's the hero Gotham deserves.
3282748	3286891	with all this talk about gaming preservation, right?
3286891	3290014	I mean, we had these other ways of hacking a PS1.
3290014	3296138	So it's like, I feel like for the most part, people can still access and play the PS1 games they want to play.
3296138	3301362	But this sort of sets the stage, like, honestly, in my mind, I'm like, okay, what's next?
3301362	3302983	Who did it on the PS2?
3302983	3305666	What game snuck it in there on the PS2 or the PS3?
3305666	3309048	Like, are we going to find that there's other consoles that had something like this as well?
3309048	3311430	Because that's going to be pretty amazing if so.
3311550	3315252	I mean, I think there have been other games that have had stuff like that.
3315252	3318754	A lot of them they catch, especially if they're updatable.
3318754	3326419	Some of these older ones, though, like with the PlayStation, you can't update PlayStation games, at least the physical games anymore.
3326419	3340788	So there have been things like I know there was like one, there's like an emulator like that they had on the there's like several emulators on the DS that were hidden in games, allowed you to play like retro games and stuff.
3340788	3340908	So.
3341428	3370170	okay so somebody is asking what's the actual cheat code get a pen and paper ready when the game loads you go into the game's option menu to unlock the cheat menu to unlock the cheat menu circle left right circle up r2 that will enable the cheat menu okay now if you want to expand the cheat menu to include stage select you press r1 down r1 right
3370718	3374160	L1 up, L2 square.
3374160	3376882	That will enable the stage selection.
3376882	3382925	Now, this cheat code is three layers deep, okay?
3382925	3385947	This is the seven layer bean dip of cheat codes, okay?
3385947	3386607	Here we go.
3386607	3391490	Now, finally, that you've unlocked that, to get the console to boot the disc,
3392230	3400237	Left, Up, Right, Down, Right, Up, Left, Square, Triangle, Square, Triangle, L1.
3400237	3403220	A sound will tell you that the cheat has been applied.
3403220	3407363	You go back to the cheat menu and you select Level 6, Section 1.
3408544	3415188	hold L1, press X, and you keep holding L1 and the disc stops spinning.
3415188	3418950	Now you swap the backup disc with the original disc.
3418950	3426054	And after swapping, hold square and triangle along with L1 and release them all to boot the backup disc.
3426054	3427014	Simple, right?
3427014	3429035	I hope you were writing fast.
3429035	3431977	I wonder if it works with import games.
3431977	3434298	I don't see it works with pirated games.
3434298	3435258	It works with burn games.
3435258	3437980	I don't see why it wouldn't work with import games.
3439457	3439897	DarkSakura
3469312	3469933	Good luck.
3469933	3470894	All right.
3470894	3472715	Godspeed in all that.
3472715	3485628	And just just skip to the end because you know 90% of creators are going to be like, and then they're going to spend because because everything on YouTube and Loki I've learned a lot about this lately since I've been expanding more on YouTube.
3485628	3486208	I don't have any
3487352	3487692	DarkSakura
3508248	3509009	How is it?
3509009	3512613	What were some of the other ways that people could do these cheat codes?
3512613	3514955	Why might a cheat code like this be important?
3514955	3516918	Let's talk a little bit about game preservation.
3516918	3525647	They want to keep your attention for 20 minutes to rank up their watch hours before they then just give you the fucking cheat code.
3525647	3528070	It's the number one thing I hate about YouTube right now.
3529369	3534579	And it's all because the monetizing algorithm is waiting watch hours.
3534579	3536242	Anyway, mm hmm.
3536242	3537284	Sorry, I'll get off.
3537284	3537765	I'll get off my chair.
3537765	3542013	I still don't know if the game's gotten any more value.
3542853	3545014	I'm looking on eBay.
3545014	3546155	Oh, especially on eBay.
3546155	3547356	You're probably going to see that right away.
3547356	3561704	This is the type of game like you want to go to your flea markets and that sort of thing like this weekend before news really circulates about this, because the value of this has to go way up after this news comes out.
3561704	3562264	Absolutely.
3562264	3562885	$355, $425.
3562885	3563385	It's already happened.
3572591	3577755	Maybe wait for this to stabilize a little bit too.
3577755	3588423	Then again, also Alien Trilogy is also up there, but hits for the Alien Resurrection are pretty expensive.
3588423	3593227	Wow, just get an emulator at that point.
3593227	3594107	Still, kind of neat.
3594107	3597530	Or, you know what, just... I mean, really?
3599244	3609789	I told you back before KB went under, we tore up an entire KB trying to find the last PlayStation that had the I.O.
3609789	3612350	port on the back and we found one.
3612350	3613670	Oh, yeah.
3613670	3617052	Staff took it as a personal challenge.
3617052	3618272	I love it.
3618272	3619833	It was pretty great.
3619833	3621134	All right.
3621134	3622134	Let's move on.
3622134	3626496	And DarkSakura, from the past to the future and futures past, right?
3629147	3631048	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
3631048	3637030	So, Sega has their whole revival thing going on.
3637030	3643772	And we have some new information for the revivals coming out.
3643772	3651055	We have Crazy Taxi, Golden Axe, Jet Set Radio, Shinobi, Streets of Rage.
3651055	3654976	They announced this on December 12th at their management meeting.
3656565	3660408	Jet Set Radio will be in open world Tokyo.
3660408	3665753	Streets of Rage is titled Streets of Rage Revolution.
3665753	3674240	So, yeah, I mean, these, just looking at the artwork for them looks pretty, pretty rad.
3674240	3679805	But yeah, it actually says on the Jet Set Radio little teaser image
3681027	3682128	I'll just read it aloud.
3682128	3687715	Counterculture, Tokyo streets, open world.
3687715	3692721	Experience the rebellion movement that feels free in a suffocating society.
3692721	3695805	Make friends, increase your fans, and create a movement.
3698667	3709410	Shinobi's artwork looks just pretty epic too, but it says, grab Oborozuki, the legendary sword, and slay evil once more.
3709410	3712351	Your clan and the world are counting on you.
3712351	3724075	And then Streets of Rage Revolution just says, beloved side-scrolling beat-em-up action series, take control of one of the ex-officers and make the city a place where people no longer have to walk the streets of rage.
3726112	3728433	I'm excited about these revivals.
3728433	3731294	The Jet Set Radio being open world is very interesting.
3731294	3733575	So, yeah.
3733575	3734736	Looking forward to seeing what develops.
3734736	3736677	I wonder if any of these will actually come out next year.
3736677	3738077	We'll see.
3738077	3740818	CrazyTaxi1 says something that's giving me pause.
3740818	3746261	It says, cheerful feeling of freedom cross fusion of nature and city.
3748464	3751585	I'm assuming that just means you can drop people off in the forest.
3751585	3753745	I wonder if it's modeled after San Francisco again.
3753745	3756706	Maybe you drive across the Golden Gate and drop people off.
3756706	3757246	I don't know.
3757246	3757726	Who knows?
3757726	3758366	In Marin.
3758366	3759827	Yeah, in Marin.
3759827	3761067	Here's the Skywalker Ranch.
3761067	3761387	Bye.
3761387	3766488	I was like, which isn't really, but it's a little more rural than a lot of a lot of the areas out there.
3766488	3770469	So I mean, it's kind of up in the hilly part of Marin.
3770469	3770789	Yeah.
3770789	3771250	Yeah.
3771250	3775551	Well, and usually a lot of those games, I don't know, it's dense things.
3775551	3776051	Yeah.
3776051	3776571	Well, I mean,
3777814	3784496	But we have so much more capability now than than that era, the Naomi Dreamcast era.
3784496	3786737	You know, I think they could do.
3786737	3788757	I mean, we'll look at the GTA games.
3788757	3795959	What if, you know, we had a crazy taxi that like.
3795959	3799440	Had, you know, that kind of a scale, that would be pretty intense.
3799440	3804942	And to be fair, some people play GTA like it is crazy taxi, except instead of dropping the passengers off, they kill them.
3806852	3809773	Crazy Carmageddon
3823453	3839219	like a mode that's like a crazy race where you have to get from point A to point B against another player but you have to pick up passengers on the way and drop them off because that's the only way you're gonna refuel your time limit.
3839219	3843521	Didn't they have that like the Dreamcast version?
3843521	3844641	I didn't think it was like that.
3844641	3846302	Like couldn't you play multiplayer split screen in that?
3847725	3850809	But it wasn't quite like what I was thinking.
3850809	3855977	Cause I, I, you know, like do something like, like, uh, I almost said LAN, what's up with me?
3856434	3858435	You know, online or something.
3858435	3864818	Well, it's also kind of funny to think that, like, now we live in this Lyft and Uber type of world.
3864818	3869380	So I wonder how that might impact kind of what they do with Crazy Taxi.
3869380	3869860	I don't know.
3869860	3877304	Like, I wonder if if it's actually a taxi or if it's you can drive different types of cars because it's like Lyft and Uber type of stuff now.
3877304	3877984	So I don't know.
3877984	3879225	Just food for thought.
3880726	3884107	I don't know, Crazy Taxi is just fairly timeless.
3884107	3886567	I don't think that they should mess with the formula too much.
3886567	3887608	That's fair.
3887608	3890028	Just add in like extra modes.
3890028	3895069	Oh, Sia Tabiri is mentioning that almost sounds like the one Simpsons driving game.
3895069	3896090	That's right.
3896090	3897450	I remember the Simpsons hit and run.
3897450	3898470	The Simpsons hit and run.
3898470	3901051	Yeah, that was fun.
3901051	3903231	Orange Wright says Crazy Taxi competitive mode.
3903231	3905112	That seems like it would be interesting.
3905112	3905592	Esports.
3908484	3912186	DarkSakura is ready to get into e-sports with Competitive Crazy Taxi.
3912186	3915608	You know what?
3915608	3921612	Well, you know what our big thing was for a long time was Hydro Thunder.
3921612	3923313	Hydro Thunder was so good.
3923313	3926615	I remember you all had the actual fucking people don't know this.
3926615	3928816	I don't think because I don't think we ever put it on YouTube or anything.
3928816	3930437	You had an actual fucking rig.
3930437	3932258	You may still have it, but I don't know.
3932258	3934660	You have the actual fucking driving rig in your house.
3934660	3934840	Yeah.
3935200	3938541	No, we sold that years ago to my friend Travis.
3938541	3939421	But you had one.
3939421	3944042	And that wasn't necessarily... That came after Dreamcast.
3944042	3947863	Like, that was for sim racing.
3947863	3954784	Still, I always thought that was like... There's dedication to your craft, and then there's that.
3954784	3955244	Oh, no.
3955244	3963666	You should see some of the big sim racers out there, though, that like... We saw this one person who literally bought a race car.
3965003	3969409	And built his multi-window rig inside of a race car.
3978965	3982388	Simracing is, is nuts.
3982388	3989114	You should just check out like the Fanatic forums, F-A-N-A-T-I-C, or with a K, something like that.
3989114	3993638	But, um, they're one of the, the big, uh, you know, they, them Thrustmaster.
3993638	4002206	I mean, there's the companies that do all the sim rigs, but I would love having something like that set up for Hydro Thunder or Crazy Taxi.
4002206	4003547	You know, it doesn't have to be all of that.
4004528	4007669	You know, multi screen and all of this in front of you.
4007669	4012691	It just needs to be, you know, something that give you a little bit of arcade experience.
4012691	4014732	All right.
4014732	4015412	Well, let's move on.
4015412	4019933	We have just a couple more stories for you, and then we're going to get to the classic game of the week and all that good stuff.
4019933	4023135	So, Loki, I guess I kind of spoiled this one earlier.
4023135	4026516	Sorry, but it was it was kind of in line with what we were talking about at the top.
4026516	4026876	I mean,
4027563	4031705	Yeah, so like, you know, well, we just had a couple leaks, so how about a couple more?
4031705	4040010	You know, now we have Ubisoft saying that on December 20th, an unknown threat actor compromised Ubisoft.
4040010	4051536	They had individual access for roughly 48 hours, and they aimed to exfiltrate roughly 900 gigabytes of data, but lost access.
4051536	4054777	So couldn't get that download finished, I guess.
4056718	4066605	But yeah, they did apparently review, I guess, data through Microsoft Teams, Confluence, and SharePoint.
4066605	4070468	Looking at corporate documents, I guess.
4070468	4071609	Not sure, though.
4071609	4074591	It says screenshots.
4074591	4084158	Apparently, the person that did get in there did have screenshots from the hack, and now they're investigating to see what the extent of it was.
4084963	4091230	So don't be surprised if you get Ubisoft leaks here in the next week or so.
4091230	4092391	Cause it's just going to keep happening.
4092391	4093653	You got to tighten your security folks.
4094899	4097962	Bobby Blackelvenchat says this happens more often than is reported.
4097962	4100185	Yeah, I wonder to what extent.
4100185	4104509	I'm sure there has to be some sort of sharing that happens between companies.
4104509	4105810	This is very common.
4105810	4116742	Companies that you wouldn't think would work together do when it comes to things like fraud, hacking, these sorts of things.
4119175	4127260	I don't know how much I want to say, but in my former job, I was aware of some of this stuff about how like we would work with competitors.
4127260	4129102	And you would think, why would these companies work together?
4129102	4130923	It's because of this.
4130923	4135746	I truly do not know how much this goes on in the gaming industry, how much that type of partnership happens.
4135746	4137467	I imagine it must.
4137467	4147434	And it's one of those things that just isn't talked about for obvious reasons, because you don't want the hackers to know, you know, the bad hackers to know that they're working together, they're enhancing this here.
4147434	4149075	If this isn't happening,
4149355	4152479	DarkSakura, VOG Network, Ranma, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4166397	4167038	you name it.
4186636	4188797	that a lot of that is not kind of out there.
4188797	4193821	But I get why not like I can understand like, yeah, they don't want the hackers to know like how they work together.
4193821	4199805	But it's a interesting Bobby Blackwell in chat says the industry doesn't hate each other like the consumers do.
4199805	4203287	Oh, yeah, well, I'll leave that to the youtubers.
4203287	4204548	All right.
4204548	4207850	And certain Twitch streamers to be fair, I don't want to just make this a YouTube problem.
4207850	4211133	It's just the excessiveness for clicks problem.
4211133	4211353	All right.
4212515	4217721	Anyway, let's talk about the type of stuff that ought to be getting clicks, dang it.
4217721	4222006	And that is some re-releases of some retro PC titles.
4222006	4226571	And when I mean retro, I mean, like, the really cool retro shit.
4226571	4230355	SSI, or Strategy Simulations Inc., and Mindscape Games.
4230956	4239203	being re-released by the company SNEG on Steam or GOG, good old games, depending on where you prefer to get your games.
4239203	4245869	Some of the games that are coming out with this re-release include... Yes, Bobby Blackwell says this is the Quest Buster section.
4246590	4248671	Very much, but like, you know what?
4248671	4252814	Rob Roberts sees some good stuff in here too, so there's this little something in here for everybody.
4252814	4265081	So, the Fantasy Collection, including Fantasy, Fantasy 2, Fantasy 3, and Fantasy 4, which was exclusively a Japanese home computer release, by the way, even though it was an American developer that made it.
4265081	4268022	Those are coming.
4268022	4270464	We also have the Great Naval Battles Collection.
4271864	4277666	Wargame Construction Set Collection Star Command Prophecy of the Shadow Renegade Battle for Jacob's Star
4291280	4295822	which was a sequel to Renegade Legion, which has not been re-released yet.
4295822	4308789	And then we also have Savage Warriors, which is a fighting game, and then Warbreeds, which is like a 90s RTS, but you can modify the unit's DNA to create new configurations.
4308789	4309569	So you know what?
4309569	4316653	There's probably a lot of people that have never heard of these games, and that is exactly why they're being re-released, because this is a really kind of niche
4317213	4321516	Speaking of bringing niche games to the forefront, love that transition, so roll that bumper.
4339952	4347695	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time, where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
4347695	4351616	It's time for the Classic Game of the Week.
4351616	4356038	And what did you pick for us this week, DarkSakura?
4356038	4361300	Well, I pointed my compass at Europe and I went for Asterix.
4362672	4374827	So there were a few different platform games that were created and I thought I had picked the first one.
4378649	4379230	There we go.
4379230	4380491	Okay.
4380491	4389701	So, um, I actually am going for- I'm trying- You know, this is actually a little bit embarrassing because I thought I had picked the right one.
4389701	4398010	So, um, we are gonna go with, uh, just, I guess, uh, some of the games in the series.
4398010	4398110	Um...
4401862	4402683	Super Nintendo
4421650	4424931	You know what, I think I had the right one after all, so pardon me.
4424931	4427252	It's Super Nintendo, is the one we're looking at.
4427252	4430033	Yeah, the game is Asterix.
4430033	4441597	And it is... There are actually three platform games that came out for the NES, the SNES, and the Game Boy.
4441597	4444878	And they're all based off of a comic book series called Asterix.
4447223	4455650	They were only available in PAL regions, so they were all exclusively European.
4455650	4466918	So basically, to go a little bit more with the SNES one, it actually was released in 1993.
4466918	4473543	There was a US release to be considered, but it was cancelled.
4474484	4482231	So basically, a little bit of backstory if no one's familiar with Asterix and Obelix.
4482231	4494441	It's a comic that came out in France by an artist who
4497802	4509028	His name is Albert M. Uderzo and also created by René, I'm going to mispronounce this, Goscinny, who is a Belgian-French artist.
4509028	4517312	Anyway, but it's about these Gauls who resisted Roman occupation and
4518192	4524073	They are basically, it's their adventures post the Gaulish Wars.
4524073	4530974	There's lots of history involved in it, like real historical references.
4530974	4546957	At any rate, you play as Asterix in this one, and you have to go through different levels all over Europe fighting Romans and animals, and you have to rescue your friend Obelix before Caesar has him thrown to the lions.
4548097	4565261	It takes place in 50 BCE, where Gaul is completely occupied by the Romans and you come from this one village that continues to resist and has a magic potion that makes them invincible.
4565261	4572042	But now that Obelix is gone, basically the Romans have taken him off and you have to go save him.
4575723	4582610	This game, I mean, it's very simple, little platformer.
4582610	4590678	If you can find one that, you know, I'm sure that there are conversions now that make them run at NTSC rates.
4593143	4594183	I've played it.
4594183	4596925	It's actually pretty fun.
4596925	4602107	Just a nice little engaging platformer.
4602107	4612431	But the thing is that as far as popularity, two of the biggest franchises at that time in Europe were Asterix and the Smurfs.
4613399	4614980	And we got the Smurfs over here.
4614980	4616401	We got tons of Smurfs games.
4616401	4625749	But Asterix... Now, I remember the Asterix comics being translated in the Sunday paper.
4625749	4633075	I was gonna say, I also remember the SNES Asterix game that was a blockbuster.
4633075	4635276	It didn't come out in the US.
4635276	4636738	Really?
4636738	4638159	I swear, I remember seeing it.
4639991	4645746	So, um, it was cancelled in the US.
4645746	4646709	Asterix Games.
4648152	4661421	Um, but basically, um, there was, yeah, there was, I believe, an unreleased version that's floating out there and, like, some Smurfs games.
4661421	4671668	Um, but yeah, it was cancelled for the US release, but I do believe that there were other Asterix games that did eventually come out.
4671668	4672668	Um, and indeed, uh,
4674281	4682003	Hold on, I'll be able to, I think I know which one did come out over here.
4682003	4688385	And I want to say it was one of the PlayStation releases.
4688385	4702269	There was, well, maybe it was one of the Sega ones, but I don't think so, because there was Asterix and the Power of the Gods, and there was Asterix the Great Rescue, but I don't believe that either of them
4703001	4709405	Hmm, yeah, I don't remember now.
4709405	4714028	Yeah, there were there were though a bunch of like a bunch.
4714028	4715829	Oh, you know what I'm thinking?
4715829	4717269	I'm thinking the Lost Vikings.
4717269	4718690	That's what I'm thinking.
4718690	4719891	The Lost Vikings?
4719891	4723093	Yeah, that's similar, similar, but not quite.
4727444	4735071	There was the PlayStation one that we didn't get as well that had like really terrible realistic artwork on it.
4735071	4737693	There was Asterix and Obelix XXL.
4737693	4742618	There were a few of those that were on PS2.
4742618	4744079	I don't know that we ever got those.
4744079	4746041	There was Asterix at the Olympic Games.
4749418	4755085	That one did come out in the U.S., 2008.
4755085	4763374	So we did get a few of the games in the U.S., but not many of them just because they didn't have the same popularity here.
4763374	4768180	Although I remember very clearly reading the comics when I was a kid.
4771192	4772793	Yeah, Great Rescue did make it.
4772793	4775494	Thank you, OrangeRite.
4775494	4781197	But I would say, you know, if you can find an NTSC conversion for the game, definitely give it a play.
4781197	4783518	It's a fun one.
4783518	4784378	But that's it.
4784378	4785779	It's Asterix.
4785779	4786719	All right.
4786719	4787440	There it is.
4787440	4790781	Product of France.
4790781	4794943	And product of this classic Game of the Week segment.
4794943	4795864	The last one.
4796670	4796930	are here!
4820902	4821422	All right.
4821422	4827565	Yeah, you might find some repeats from other things I've brought up, but we've got some interesting ones.
4827565	4831966	I'll send you and Loki the preliminary list so you can get an idea.
4831966	4833267	Sounds good.
4834602	4838865	All right, well, we're just about to the end of what we have.
4838865	4844589	Yeah, Bobby says so asterisk SNES can be a game next month too.
4844589	4845349	Because it was canceled.
4845349	4846010	Get it?
4846010	4847831	All right.
4847831	4851934	Let's move on and talk about some other news very quickly here.
4851934	4860119	We're actually getting towards the end because again, with it being a holiday week, we don't have quite as much news, but we have at least one email tonight and maybe some calls.
4860119	4864502	But let's check in with Rapid Fire News first with just Loki with a couple stories tonight.
4865182	4867504	Yeah, so a couple quick announcements.
4867504	4882674	So there is a big announcement by Amazon Studios and Games Workshop that they are working with Henry Cavill to bring Warhammer 40,000 to movies and television.
4882674	4886236	They're going to be having multiple projects based around that.
4886236	4889919	And I know Henry Cavill is a very huge Warhammer fan.
4890519	4893081	So that's exciting.
4893081	4896823	And he's going to be an executive producer on these.
4896823	4902966	So someone that clearly loves the franchise, going to bring that stuff to the screen.
4902966	4904547	Sign me up.
4904547	4906689	I'm down.
4906689	4911131	PlayStation 5 has surpassed 50 million units sold now.
4911131	4914853	Not bad, considering they had shortages for a long time.
4914853	4917315	Yeah.
4917315	4919476	That's very well done to them.
4920492	4921293	Yep.
4921293	4922794	All right.
4922794	4925697	Well, we'll get some other news in a couple weeks.
4925697	4926458	So we're back.
4926458	4929441	But for now, let's travel around the world and check out release dates.
4929441	4937368	I, I have a feeling it's going to be a big zilch because this is going to be this is almost nothing, but I'm going to check anyway.
4937368	4938229	Just be thorough.
4938229	4940831	Do we have anything coming out in the US this week, Loki?
4940831	4944255	We have pinball M coming out Nintendo switch.
4944255	4944655	That's it.
4944795	4948298	Oh, I forgot to mention I did play that this week a little bit.
4948298	4952621	I picked up the free version of that because it comes with one table free.
4952621	4955803	And then you can play the other tables for like a three minute trial.
4955803	4958405	And I did try that Dead by Daylight table.
4958405	4965770	And the thing that cracked me up most about the Dead by Daylight table is that I was like, oh, OK, it's like the core four survivors.
4965770	4968872	But then when I looked carefully, I was like, oh, it's Dwight.
4970513	4974397	Claudette, Jake, and Fong Min are the survivors.
4974397	4975938	And I was like, wait a minute.
4975938	4978420	I was like, that's actually not the core four.
4978420	4978861	Oh my God.
4978861	4982063	They deleted Meg.
4982063	4985646	Nope.
4985646	4989930	Fong Min has taken her place officially.
4989930	4991812	That crapped me up.
4994898	4998301	Why do they keep giving her all the cosmetics and now they take out Meg?
4998301	4999542	How dare?
4999542	5000422	It's rude.
5000422	5001943	It's just the pinball table.
5001943	5002604	And who knows?
5002604	5003605	There could be more.
5003605	5004726	And, you know, who knows?
5004726	5006767	But it did crack me.
5006767	5009289	They're like treating her like Meg from Family Guy.
5009289	5010550	Yeah.
5010550	5016494	And to be fair, I think the pinball table is from the perspective of the trapper, because I think you're actually trying to hook the survivors.
5016494	5018676	I couldn't really tell what the story was going on.
5018676	5022179	But yeah, I did play that just a little bit.
5022179	5022279	So.
5023035	5028001	All right, well, traveling over to Japan and checking out the releases there, nothing.
5028001	5035591	The only thing of note is that if you still, I don't know how you could possibly still have not beaten Yakuza Like a Dragon.
5036581	5043945	But if that's you, you can now get a price-reduced version coming out in Japan this week on the PlayStation 5.
5043945	5051569	That is the only new release, because technically it's a new pressing of the game, because it gets the special box that says, I'm cheap.
5051569	5055612	So that is the only release in Japan this week on the 26th.
5055612	5058533	DarkSakura, anything in Europe?
5058533	5059514	Nothing.
5059514	5059914	Nothing.
5059914	5060774	No.
5060774	5061035	All right.
5063339	5069424	Well, we'll try again in a couple weeks when things maybe will pick up a little bit again as we get into the new year.
5069424	5078692	It used to be that January was usually a barren month, but that pattern's kind of changed in the last couple years, so be curious to see that when we come back.
5079392	5088441	Alright, let's get to the listener roundtable where we invite your calls and so forth to participate with our show tonight.
5088441	5090282	We also invite your emails every week.
5090282	5094766	Participate at OrangeLoungeRater.com is the place to send your emails.
5094766	5097249	And I believe we do have one to read tonight, right, DarkSakura?
5099264	5100084	We do.
5100084	5102946	It was one that I missed and I'm sorry about this.
5102946	5105947	So this was from the 12th.
5105947	5108729	It was buried in the spam.
5108729	5110810	So I'll go ahead and read.
5110810	5114011	Hey OLR, it's been a while since I last wrote in.
5114011	5121755	I heard on the last episode that Loki got a Playdate console and wanted to confirm that it's become a wonderful platform for making indie games.
5122375	5131101	Not only is the development platform free and well-documented, but there's now a healthy, if small, market of players willing to pay for tiny indie games.
5131101	5137304	I was lucky to be in the first batch of pre-orders and released a puzzle game called Squish last summer.
5137304	5140306	To my delight, it's now sold over a thousand copies.
5140306	5144229	I can't see that ever happening for me on mobile or PC.
5144229	5146230	Best of luck with your Playdate development, Loki.
5146230	5148391	Perhaps a one-bit pixel poops.
5148391	5148732	Elliot B.
5149412	5150912	I thought about that.
5150912	5152133	That's a possibility.
5152133	5154913	Yeah, I appreciate it.
5154913	5159114	I got the one code for Squish, and I need to figure out how to sideload stuff.
5159114	5160435	I think there's a way to do it.
5160435	5165756	You have to go and log into your Play Day account and do it that way.
5165756	5166936	But that should be fine.
5166936	5171238	I was thinking game-wise, yeah, I still want to do a mini-golf game, I think.
5171238	5176779	That would be really good, especially with the crank, because executive golf is okay, but it's not...
5178470	5180793	It's not like a real golf game.
5180793	5182474	It's just side scrolling.
5182474	5183896	It's kind of weird.
5183896	5196930	But I think a game that actually used the crank as like a putter, so you're actually like swinging it like a putter and like how fast you swing it now, all that would be really cool to just have it almost completely cranked base.
5197150	5198071	Patent pending.
5198071	5199491	Somebody's gonna steal your idea, Loki.
5199491	5200052	You're saying too much.
5200052	5201433	Patent pending.
5201433	5204394	It has to be some fishing games on there, I'm sure.
5204394	5226648	There's a fishing game, and then there's one that's called Real Steel, and it's basically, you're using a fishing rod, and it's almost like that Mission Impossible thing, where you're dropping in to steal things, so you're using a fishing rod in that sense as well, and you crank the guy up and down and steal stuff.
5228260	5230522	I just had an idea.
5230522	5235468	Bungie ferret tossing with the crank.
5235468	5239052	How do you toss the... Oh, I guess swinging it back and forth?
5239052	5240353	I mean, yeah, you can make it.
5240353	5241194	Like, you just have to...
5241957	5251623	CodeWithIt, because they have their pulp editor, which is kind of drag and drop, and it's got its own scripting language with it.
5251623	5255826	Or if you want to go more traditional, there is Lua.
5255826	5262550	And if you really want to get into high performance with that, there's C APIs for it as well.
5265137	5276047	Yeah, I'm not sure what I would need for... pulp might be enough, but there's a lot of tutorials out there showing just how to use the pulp editor and everything.
5276047	5277048	It's worth messing around with.
5277048	5286176	At the very least, even if you can't get a playdate, you can play it through their emulator that they have on their website, so you can play stuff that way and test stuff out.
5286176	5287797	Well, maybe I'll take a look at it.
5287797	5288237	I don't know.
5288237	5290880	I've got one lesson left on my Python course.
5290880	5292221	That's kind of where I'm focusing.
5293800	5294541	Thanks for watching!
5320251	5322171	Have you pooped on your friends right now?
5346665	5348646	Poop with friends.
5348646	5350847	What's an OLR pinball golf game?
5350847	5352367	How would that work?
5352367	5353327	Pinball golf?
5353327	5355468	I mean, pinball golf could be fun.
5355468	5363951	I like was thinking like when I think of a golf, like a mini golf game, like prime mini golf game, 3D Ultra mini golf obviously is good.
5363951	5365272	Those are like pretty awesome.
5365272	5371714	But even like the first mini golf game that I really liked was on the Apple II and it was called Gnarly Golf.
5372574	5386561	And that's kind of what I'm trying to emulate there, because it's basically like courses where not traditional stuff is like, oh, you're a golf ball in a prison cell, and you have to figure out where the hole is.
5386561	5392143	Or, oh, this one, you're in a backyard, and you have to avoid a hose, and stuff like that.
5392143	5393564	That's my kind of thought.
5394204	5396406	But yeah, regular mini-golf stuff.
5396406	5397187	It'll be fun.
5397187	5399429	Mini-golf's a fun pick-up-and-play type thing.
5399429	5400770	Yeah.
5400770	5403633	But there's not really... I'm surprised there's not any on there.
5403633	5406295	I mean, there's a tank golf game and then there's executive golf.
5406295	5412200	If you keep talking and don't do it, somebody's gonna... Look, you've got a Playdate developer listening to this show.
5412921	5413641	That's fine.
5413641	5422166	If I'm Elliot B, I'm sitting there twiddling my fingers going, yes, this sounds like a very good idea to add to my collection of games.
5422166	5428669	That fool, Loki, giving me ideas for free.
5428669	5434832	And Bobby, Bobby's literally admitting to doing the same thing right now in chat.
5434832	5435932	All good?
5435932	5437093	All right.
5437093	5437573	You can do it.
5437573	5440555	And there's not a lot of games on their storefront, like their storefront has
5441718	5444199	like 50 or 60 games.
5444199	5445439	It's not a lot.
5445439	5447880	So like it's easy to stand out so far.
5447880	5449500	All right.
5449500	5453021	Well, I'm going to assume there's no last minute stories tonight.
5453021	5455461	Oh, I did want to mention one last thing I just had.
5455461	5465844	I had to laugh and it's not even really newsworthy, but the Amico at home added another game to their platform, which I was like, it looks like crap, but whatever.
5466668	5476717	Um, why even put out that announcement, but, oh, you got a whole total of three games on your platform that requires two mobile devices to actually even use.
5476717	5483083	They are, they are selling what they can to make any kind of income right now.
5483083	5488208	But I will bet you've probably sold more copies of Pixel Poops than they've sold of Shark Shark.
5488208	5492472	So you can, you can go to sleep at night thinking about that.
5493496	5495256	All right.
5495256	5499678	Anyhow, that is going to wrap it up for our special holiday edition of the show.
5499678	5503419	Again, just to recap what's coming up next week, we will not be here.
5503419	5505739	So the weekend of New Year's Eve, there will be no show.
5505739	5508300	So no show here and no show on the podcast feed.
5508300	5512321	So hope you all have a great new year and a safe one, of course.
5512321	5519103	We will be back live the Sunday after New Year's Eve, which would be January the 7th.
5519103	5520103	Looking at my calendar here.
5520583	5523684	at our normal time, nine o'clock Eastern, six o'clock Pacific.
5523684	5528386	We will be back with the next episode of our program.
5528386	5533348	I hope you all have a great couple weeks and enjoying the rest of your 2023.
5533348	5537650	Look forward to 2024 and all the stuff coming up.
5537650	5539691	So that's going to do it.
5539691	5544012	DarkSakura, are you streaming today or are you just not doing that today or what?
5544012	5544913	Probably not.
5544913	5546093	Okay.
5546093	5548054	Just, you know, it's holiday.
5548054	5549515	If I stream, I stream.
5549515	5550335	If I don't, I don't.
5551059	5559124	But, um, you know what, I'll put it, you know, I'm gonna, I'm gonna buy somebody a copy of Pixel Poops number 2.
5559124	5560285	There you go.
5560285	5566709	I sold one yesterday, and that's been the first time in like, six months.
5566709	5569210	Somebody shit on someone for Christmas.
5569210	5569651	I love it.
5572319	5581282	DarkSakura, thank you so much for downloading our show or listening live, especially if you were here at the early time on Christmas Eve.
5581282	5583822	Super appreciate those of you that are here live.
5594025	5595766	Love all of you on the podcast feed as well.
5595766	5597627	I noticed there are some absent names tonight.
5597627	5601469	So I'm assuming y'all just have holiday plans and you'll probably catch us on the podcast feed.
5601469	5602390	So thank you.
5602390	5604411	No matter how it is you listen to this show.
5604411	5607173	We appreciate you being here and being part of the fam.
5607173	5611315	If you enjoyed what you heard here at OLR, help us spread the word, tell a friend or two.
5611315	5614237	We are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we need more voices to put out on air.
5614637	5616599	DarkSakura, your final thoughts tonight.
5625831	5635834	So, if I do stream, it will be around about 8.30ish, some Dead by Daylight Killer.
5635834	5638875	Who knows, maybe I'll take a request, maybe I'll play Pixel Poops.
5638875	5641676	If I can get everything working the right way.
5641676	5643597	I may not be able to on my Mac, but we'll see.
5645496	5658062	And other than that, you know, I since I won't see y'all in this form for till the new year rolls around.
5658062	5661564	I wish everyone.
5661564	5673590	In fact, I'll I'll say the same thing that I say at the end of my stream, just to be kind to yourself, be kind to other people and fact check everything.
5673590	5673990	That's all.
5675165	5678670	That's very similar to what Jerry Springer used to say without the fact-checking part.
5678670	5681153	He used to say, be kind to yourself and each other.
5681153	5681754	Or was it be good?
5681754	5683936	No, be good to yourself and each other.
5683936	5684597	Similar.
5684597	5685919	I would prefer kindness.
5685919	5688582	Goodness and kindness are different.
5688582	5689003	Fair enough.
5689003	5691025	All right.
5691025	5692047	Loki, your final thought tonight.
5693120	5697724	And my final thought is, hopefully we'll have more Minecraft content coming out.
5697724	5706471	I also, Hermitcraft Season 9 finally wrapped, and so they put their world download up, and I've uploaded that to play some Decked Out.
5706471	5707632	It's ridiculous.
5707632	5709514	Tango did an incredible job with Decked Out.
5709514	5714458	It's literally like a whole other dungeon crawling game inside vanilla Minecraft.
5714458	5715659	It's absolutely insane.
5715659	5719822	And I'm going to do something similar like that in probably a year or so, so it'll be fun.
5722518	5726780	And then my final thought is, I hope Loki will play some Lego Fortnite with me sometime.
5726780	5728201	I think that would be fun.
5728201	5729342	DarkSakura can too if she wants.
5729342	5731823	I watched someone play that last night.
5731823	5734785	Isn't it wild that it's like, wait a minute, Fortnite?
5734785	5735225	What?
5735225	5736886	No, this isn't it.
5736886	5740088	I don't know that it's enough to make me want to play Fortnite.
5741385	5742646	So, all right.
5742646	5746388	Well, thank you so much, everybody, for being here, and I appreciate it.
5746388	5752311	Hey, shout out to WayneNN in chat, who says, thanks to both OLR and Bobby for taking the time to do the early shows.
5752311	5753672	Great to be able to watch live.
5753672	5758434	Hey, if one person was able to catch it that couldn't usually catch it, it was totally worth the earlier time.
5758434	5758735	You know what?
5758735	5761856	It frees up our evenings to do our own stuff, too.
5761856	5762817	I don't mind the early time.
5762817	5763957	This was actually a lot of fun.
5763957	5764698	Thank you so much.
5764698	5767059	We need to do this more often, actually.
5767059	5770201	But thank you so much, everybody, for being here and listening.
5770541	5775664	Have a happy, safe New Year, and we will see you in two weeks.
