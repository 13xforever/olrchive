00:00.000 --> 00:13.240
This week, I had a sudden desire to play Chrono Trigger on the Switch, which isn't

00:13.240 --> 00:14.240
currently possible.

00:14.240 --> 00:17.040
I could get out my 3DS and play it there, but the ergonomics of the Switch were a little

00:17.040 --> 00:18.040
bit better for me.

00:18.040 --> 00:21.460
I could play it on my phone, and might, since my 3DS's battery is very degraded.

00:21.460 --> 00:22.880
Why am I talking about myself right now?

00:22.880 --> 00:25.800
Because the Switch release is pretty likely to happen at some point, and it's a happier

00:25.800 --> 00:28.440
thought than the rest of the news involving Square Enix right now.

00:28.440 --> 00:29.440
This is the Remake-O-Rama update.

00:29.440 --> 00:33.040
Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to get derailed by

00:33.040 --> 00:36.240
daylight and talk about the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now on the show

00:36.240 --> 00:38.280
where every gamer has a voice.

00:38.280 --> 00:43.800
Hello, my friends out there on the internet.

00:43.800 --> 00:48.120
Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:48.120 --> 00:55.400
It is Orange Lounge Radio, and we are live once again after a week off with episode number

00:55.400 --> 01:03.520
950 of our show, a landmark number of sorts for tonight, March the 5th of 2023.

01:03.520 --> 01:07.880
My name is Rob Roberts, and I'm here with you every week as are my co-hosts.

01:07.880 --> 01:10.480
Say hello to Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.

01:10.480 --> 01:11.680
What's up?

01:11.680 --> 01:12.680
Hello.

01:12.680 --> 01:17.600
Well, I say every week, but not last week, but that's my fault.

01:17.600 --> 01:19.080
It wasn't a bad reason.

01:19.080 --> 01:20.080
Yeah.

01:20.080 --> 01:23.880
No, and as I've mentioned a few times on the show, I went on a cruise.

01:23.880 --> 01:28.520
We were on a Star Trek themed cruise, and yeah, I'll tell you more about that in just

01:28.520 --> 01:35.440
a minute, but unfortunately, the only downside to that is that by going on vacation and doing

01:35.440 --> 01:39.840
a cruise and being in the airports and all that, Alan's feeling a little under weather

01:39.840 --> 01:40.840
today.

01:40.840 --> 01:44.900
We were supposed to meet Dark Sakura and one of our streamer friends who's in town, Nick

01:44.900 --> 01:45.900
and Prince.

01:45.900 --> 01:47.840
You and I both raid him a lot on our personal streams.

01:47.840 --> 01:49.920
I'm sure a lot of our viewers are familiar with him at this point.

01:49.920 --> 01:51.620
We were supposed to meet him for brunch today.

01:51.620 --> 01:56.100
You got to meet him for brunch, but I didn't because we're erring on the side of Alan's

01:56.100 --> 01:57.420
feeling a little under the weather.

01:57.420 --> 02:01.660
It doesn't seem to be COVID yet, but we're just going to err on the side of caution.

02:01.660 --> 02:07.380
And Nick seemed to appreciate that, so we just both hope that Alan gets to feeling better

02:07.380 --> 02:09.060
soon and that you don't get it.

02:09.060 --> 02:11.340
Yeah, for sure.

02:11.340 --> 02:15.780
I completely realized there is a risk with doing fun things in the world, but we tried

02:15.780 --> 02:16.780
our best.

02:16.780 --> 02:17.780
We'll see.

02:17.780 --> 02:18.780
We'll see what happens.

02:18.780 --> 02:24.180
Maybe it could just be, you know, bodies are worn down from a week straight worth of partying

02:24.180 --> 02:28.580
that honestly it could, it could just be a cold or something, you know, a little more,

02:28.580 --> 02:32.680
a little more innocent, I suppose than what we've become used to over the last three years.

02:32.680 --> 02:35.860
Are you aware that Brookfield's no longer has many loaves?

02:35.860 --> 02:38.700
No, that's a tragedy.

02:38.700 --> 02:42.980
It's an utter trash, but I did have a cranberry mimosa, so that was great.

02:42.980 --> 02:43.980
That's good.

02:43.980 --> 02:44.980
Did you get your soup?

02:45.180 --> 02:49.260
No, I ended up because I made a whole bunch of soup yesterday and I'm going to eat that

02:49.260 --> 02:52.380
up and then if I want, I'll go lemono, I'll go pick some up.

02:52.380 --> 02:53.380
Yeah.

02:53.380 --> 02:54.380
All right.

02:54.380 --> 02:56.840
Well also say hello to a, I think also a fan of soup.

02:56.840 --> 02:58.180
Say hello to Techmaster Loki.

02:58.180 --> 02:59.180
Soup is good.

02:59.180 --> 03:01.720
I've been known to have two soups in one meal.

03:01.720 --> 03:02.720
Two soups?

03:02.720 --> 03:05.140
That's an extra fancy meal.

03:05.140 --> 03:06.140
Real raisin bran.

03:06.140 --> 03:07.140
There's two soups.

03:07.140 --> 03:09.180
Uh, what, what, what's your favorite soup?

03:09.180 --> 03:12.540
Um, well, I like a good French onion soup.

03:12.540 --> 03:13.540
Ah, oh.

03:14.100 --> 03:15.100
On the cruise.

03:15.100 --> 03:21.460
Cause you know, you get to eat in the main dining room and there's a French onion soup

03:21.460 --> 03:22.460
that was so good.

03:22.460 --> 03:23.460
Yeah.

03:23.460 --> 03:25.380
That's one of my faves too.

03:25.380 --> 03:28.600
But a good chicken tortilla, I think is always going to be one of my favorites.

03:28.600 --> 03:30.340
And now creating a French onion soup.

03:30.340 --> 03:31.340
My bad.

03:31.340 --> 03:32.340
My bad.

03:32.340 --> 03:33.340
My bad.

03:33.340 --> 03:34.340
All right.

03:34.340 --> 03:38.500
Well also say hello to all of you listening live as we do tape live every Sunday night

03:38.500 --> 03:42.740
at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at the

03:42.740 --> 03:47.500
voice of geeks network, twitch.tv slash a VOG network.

03:47.500 --> 03:51.140
And you can chat along with our show if you're listening to us live over at twitch.tv slash

03:51.140 --> 03:57.380
a VOG network where VX Jason XV chiming in on the soup says hot and sour soup is my jam.

03:57.380 --> 03:59.140
I can't believe I forgot hot and sour soup.

03:59.140 --> 04:00.140
That is the best.

04:00.140 --> 04:01.140
Hot and sour soup is the best.

04:01.140 --> 04:02.140
Yeah, I love it.

04:02.140 --> 04:03.140
I love it.

04:03.140 --> 04:04.140
But I, I,

04:04.140 --> 04:07.260
Number one, avgolemono, number two, war wanton.

04:07.260 --> 04:11.840
I do love war wanton and I know the vinegary part of hot and sour soup can really make

04:11.840 --> 04:13.120
a hit and miss for people.

04:13.120 --> 04:18.200
But when I'm sick, there's nothing I want more than hot and sour soup is number three.

04:18.200 --> 04:19.200
So good.

04:19.200 --> 04:21.200
Homemade chicken matzo soup.

04:21.200 --> 04:25.480
The time potato soup is good too, especially for bacon.

04:25.480 --> 04:27.100
I do love potato soup.

04:27.100 --> 04:31.160
Since we're derailing this with soup, I will tell you about the soup I made.

04:31.160 --> 04:37.640
Um, I, we had a rotisserie chicken and I keep a like vegetable scraps that are still good.

04:37.640 --> 04:43.780
And I'll freeze them in, in my, uh, in my freezer and add them all into like a, a stock.

04:43.780 --> 04:47.320
And so, but I didn't have very many, just like the ends of a couple of onions and like

04:47.320 --> 04:48.320
a basil leaf.

04:48.320 --> 04:54.040
So I threw that in there, threw in some fresh trimmings from my Rosemary Oregano thyme.

04:54.040 --> 04:59.300
Um, and I took all the chicken off the rotisserie chicken and put that in the fridge.

04:59.300 --> 05:06.240
And then I cooked down all the bones for about four hours into a really good, rich bone stock.

05:06.240 --> 05:09.040
And then I strained all the bones out and threw all that away.

05:09.040 --> 05:13.440
And I added in another thing of chicken stock that I happen to have because I needed it

05:13.440 --> 05:14.440
loaded up.

05:14.440 --> 05:19.320
So what is in this soup is a dark meat and white meat rotisserie chicken.

05:19.320 --> 05:22.580
So it's nice and tender and not at all dry.

05:22.580 --> 05:25.280
It's got charred leek.

05:25.280 --> 05:29.000
And then the mirepoix that, you know, you have to have that first for soup it's, which

05:29.000 --> 05:33.440
is onion, carrot and a celery.

05:33.440 --> 05:35.600
And my soup is fucking delightful.

05:35.600 --> 05:38.720
Now I want soup, but I did this to myself.

05:38.720 --> 05:39.720
Congrats.

05:39.720 --> 05:40.720
I played myself.

05:40.720 --> 05:45.120
Um, so, uh, I make a good chicken soup.

05:45.120 --> 05:48.140
No cereal is not soup.

05:48.140 --> 05:50.360
On a, on a programming type of note.

05:50.360 --> 05:52.840
So I did mention the Star Trek cruise.

05:52.840 --> 05:53.840
That is where I was at.

05:53.840 --> 05:56.220
And you might be wondering what the hell is a Star Trek cruise?

05:56.220 --> 05:57.680
What makes it different than a regular cruise?

05:57.680 --> 06:01.980
And the short answer is the celebrities in the shows, but the long answer, I'm going

06:01.980 --> 06:04.260
to do a special stream here at VOG network.

06:04.260 --> 06:07.400
We haven't been able to do a lot of special programming outside of Sunday nights, but

06:07.400 --> 06:10.980
I really want to try to get correcting the course on that.

06:10.980 --> 06:17.620
So Thursday here at VOG network at about five 30 Pacific eight 30 Eastern, um, captain Matt,

06:17.620 --> 06:23.200
formerly of the starboard power coupling formerly, formerly grandpa Warcraft from courthouse,

06:23.200 --> 06:26.660
who was also on the cruise with me and, and essentially was the one that got me to start

06:26.660 --> 06:30.700
going on the cruise will be joining me for a special stream on Thursday night to talk

06:30.700 --> 06:32.220
all about the cruise.

06:32.220 --> 06:36.620
Even if you could give a shit about the star Trek cruise, we're going to play Overwatch

06:36.620 --> 06:38.700
together live on stream.

06:38.700 --> 06:40.420
He plays competitively.

06:40.420 --> 06:49.260
I don't so it's, and if you've ever heard Matt and I interacting, you know, he can sometimes

06:49.260 --> 06:51.700
get very frustrated with me when I'm a baddie.

06:51.700 --> 06:54.160
So I'm sure it'll be fun for nothing else, but for that.

06:54.160 --> 06:57.740
So check that out Thursday here at the voice geeks network, uh, we will, uh, remind you

06:57.740 --> 07:02.920
on our discord server over at vog network.com slash discord.

07:02.920 --> 07:07.620
Of course, before that show, uh, I think that's all the plugs out of the way, uh, before I

07:07.620 --> 07:11.900
get to the kickoff topic tonight, which I'll ask Loki about in a minute, um, Loki, I do

07:11.900 --> 07:16.460
want to ask about, cause it was noted in the chat that you're, you have some type of like

07:16.460 --> 07:20.820
Jurassic park on rails shooter playing behind you live tonight, because you can see the

07:20.820 --> 07:23.380
video when you watch us here at Twitch TV.

07:23.380 --> 07:27.380
And I'm, I am even, I'm curious, I don't know this drastic park game that's playing behind

07:27.380 --> 07:28.380
you.

07:28.380 --> 07:32.180
I saw the logo, so I know it's drastic park and not some Dino world knockoff, but what,

07:32.180 --> 07:33.280
what is this?

07:33.280 --> 07:36.860
It is the staple of most modern arcades nowadays.

07:36.860 --> 07:40.500
It's Jurassic park, the arcade by Roth reels.

07:40.500 --> 07:43.760
It's it is an on a rail shooter, Jurassic park game.

07:43.760 --> 07:44.760
Got it.

07:44.760 --> 07:47.020
It's like my, my youngest son's favorite game at the arcade.

07:47.020 --> 07:48.020
Is it?

07:48.020 --> 07:49.020
Okay.

07:49.020 --> 07:50.520
I was kind of curious why you picked that game.

07:50.520 --> 07:55.560
You know, I w I was a little bummed to miss the shenanigans that a dark soccer Nick Prince

07:55.560 --> 08:00.060
were up to earlier today because the, the play, I guess it's okay for me to say that

08:00.060 --> 08:02.480
cause you're, you're done now.

08:02.480 --> 08:07.800
So it's not like listeners can go find you, but the, the place where they met up was Brookfield's,

08:07.800 --> 08:10.620
the little restaurant in front of Roseville golf land.

08:10.620 --> 08:14.400
And I was thinking, Oh, wouldn't it be a hoot if dark soccer and I went over to Roseville

08:14.400 --> 08:22.420
golf land after and took some sad face movies on the show of our old stomping grounds instead

08:22.420 --> 08:23.800
of Roseville golf land.

08:23.800 --> 08:25.600
Oh, that's probably smart.

08:25.600 --> 08:29.160
Um, and Nick was talking about having played that Minecraft game there, but we went to

08:29.160 --> 08:30.160
target.

08:30.160 --> 08:31.160
Oh, Tarshay.

08:31.160 --> 08:32.160
Good times.

08:32.160 --> 08:33.160
Did some adulting.

08:33.160 --> 08:34.160
Oh my gosh.

08:34.160 --> 08:35.160
Fun.

08:35.160 --> 08:36.920
Well, I are sheets.

08:36.920 --> 08:37.920
You know, what's funny.

08:37.920 --> 08:40.760
I also had to do a target run before my cruise.

08:40.760 --> 08:41.760
Thank God.

08:41.760 --> 08:46.580
My sister lives in long beach and was able to play chauffeur because I did not pack the

08:46.580 --> 08:50.320
guard for my Clippers.

08:50.320 --> 08:54.280
So I had to go to target and get a cheap thing of Clippers, which we kind of needed a new

08:54.280 --> 08:58.540
one anyway, which whatever, just because I forgot the guard and I didn't want, uh, Alan

08:58.540 --> 09:03.360
has a big bushy beard, which is very handsome, but, um, I, mine will grow uneven.

09:03.360 --> 09:07.840
It will be very ugly if I don't keep it, uh, uh, even so.

09:07.840 --> 09:08.840
Yeah.

09:08.840 --> 09:09.840
Yeah.

09:09.840 --> 09:16.080
Well, um, one of the things though, is that, you know, that like the part of Roseville

09:16.080 --> 09:23.960
closer to the, the freeway is like my old, my old stomping grounds, like used to shop

09:23.960 --> 09:25.520
at that Trader Joe's over there.

09:25.520 --> 09:31.000
Um, and so when I dropped Nick off, I actually went over there and went back to, it's called

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
the Oriental market.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.400
It's very, very lots of good Filipino food.

09:35.400 --> 09:38.360
Like you can get all kinds of frozen lumpia and everything.

09:38.360 --> 09:42.040
And I bought Ube rolls and I'm super happy.

09:42.040 --> 09:44.760
Is that in the same shopping center as Trader Joe's?

09:44.760 --> 09:45.960
It's a bit down the street.

09:45.960 --> 09:46.960
Okay.

09:46.960 --> 09:51.600
Cause I was like, when I, when I was a kid growing up there, none of that was to say,

09:51.600 --> 09:52.600
like it wasn't even Trader Joe's.

09:52.600 --> 09:55.360
It was something else that I don't even remember what it was, but it wasn't Trader Joe's.

09:55.360 --> 09:57.160
So it was just, yeah.

09:57.160 --> 09:59.800
There were some things that were still there.

09:59.800 --> 10:03.960
Like they were poor, like the same Starbucks is there, but I was happy.

10:03.960 --> 10:08.480
The one thing, which was a chubby diner for the record, not a Starbucks, the thing that

10:08.480 --> 10:12.720
makes me a little bit sad though, is that when I went in, the ladies working didn't

10:12.720 --> 10:19.960
have on Filipino dramas, which are hilarious to watch if you don't understand the language.

10:19.960 --> 10:20.960
I bet.

10:20.960 --> 10:21.960
All right.

10:21.960 --> 10:25.020
Well, let's get into some games and talk about some of the things from this week and maybe

10:25.020 --> 10:26.560
some of the things we missed as well.

10:26.560 --> 10:28.760
We'll invite your topics a little later on in the show.

10:28.760 --> 10:32.340
I think most of our news tonight is from the past week, but if there's something we missed

10:32.340 --> 10:35.520
from two weeks ago, you really want us to touch on, we'll get to that during the listener

10:35.520 --> 10:37.180
round table a little bit later.

10:37.180 --> 10:41.680
But for now, let's talk about the story we talk about every week, every week.

10:41.680 --> 10:48.280
It's the ongoing soap opera that is the acquisition of Activision by Microsoft.

10:48.280 --> 10:53.240
But there's some interesting developments this week that are worth talking about here.

10:53.240 --> 10:54.240
Yes.

10:54.240 --> 11:01.320
According to Reuters, the European Commission is considered likely to approve the acquisition

11:01.320 --> 11:04.160
of Activision Blizzard by Microsoft.

11:04.160 --> 11:09.680
That's surprising actually, because I wonder what changed because all the predictions were

11:09.680 --> 11:12.720
saying that they weren't going to approve that.

11:12.720 --> 11:16.560
And I don't know if maybe some of the concessions or the Nintendo announcement or some of these

11:16.560 --> 11:20.180
like Call of Duty, I'd be very curious.

11:20.180 --> 11:22.040
And granted, I could have just missed some of this.

11:22.040 --> 11:24.660
I've been out of the loop on the news, full disclosure.

11:24.660 --> 11:29.600
Like when I was on the boat, I'm not sitting there reading Twitter or social, any form

11:29.600 --> 11:33.660
of social media and keeping it on top of the gaming news.

11:33.660 --> 11:34.940
I'm enjoying the cruise.

11:34.940 --> 11:38.720
So I don't know if something swung the pendulum hard the other direction, but it's fascinating

11:38.720 --> 11:42.160
to me that all of the needles were they're going to say no, they're going to say no.

11:42.160 --> 11:46.560
And now it's they're going to say yes, because I think if they say yes, I think Europe was

11:46.560 --> 11:49.120
more likely to say no than America, quite frankly.

11:49.120 --> 11:50.120
I'm sorry.

11:50.120 --> 11:56.520
Now I have Madeline Kahn in my head going, no, no, no, no, no, no, yes.

11:56.520 --> 12:01.520
I think it's probably they've been showing that, you know, they are committed to putting

12:01.520 --> 12:05.360
their games out multi platform, like with these different deals that they're doing with

12:05.360 --> 12:10.840
like Nvidia, Steam, Nintendo.

12:10.840 --> 12:14.560
So it's I don't know.

12:14.560 --> 12:20.140
I think it's probably some goodwill there, at least with making those moves and probably

12:20.140 --> 12:21.140
further looking.

12:21.140 --> 12:25.120
I mean, honestly, like if you look in the Sony, like they do the same stuff like we

12:25.120 --> 12:29.800
like are you really going to say like that they don't pay for exclusives and stuff like

12:29.800 --> 12:30.800
that?

12:30.800 --> 12:31.800
Like they do that all the time.

12:31.800 --> 12:32.800
Like in.

12:32.800 --> 12:34.720
So it'd be interesting to see what comes out of that.

12:34.720 --> 12:38.920
Speaking of which, one of the things that may come out of that is revealing what Sony

12:38.920 --> 12:43.380
actually pays for exclusives because they are making deals with different companies

12:43.380 --> 12:45.440
to bring games over there.

12:45.440 --> 12:50.620
And part of that argument is that they are paying to have games not only on their service,

12:50.620 --> 12:54.900
but also paying to keep them off of Game Pass.

12:54.900 --> 12:58.840
Which you know, it kind of shows that they're being a little anti competitive, if you ask

12:58.840 --> 13:02.320
me, or maybe they are being competitive, I don't know.

13:02.320 --> 13:06.940
But it is interesting, especially like, I just think the whole back and forth with them

13:06.940 --> 13:10.920
like saying, Well, you know, we just won't have the competitive advantage anymore.

13:10.920 --> 13:15.480
It's like, really, like, if that, if that didn't go through, they would totally try

13:15.480 --> 13:19.560
to buy Activision, they would do the same thing.

13:19.560 --> 13:24.040
And of course, going along with that, you know, we still have Phil Spencer still downplaying

13:24.040 --> 13:29.680
the whole acquisition thing saying basically that if, you know, it doesn't, you know, end

13:29.680 --> 13:35.640
up going through that Xbox will still exist, you know, they're going to still be there.

13:35.640 --> 13:40.560
You know, it's not some sort of linchpin for their long term plan or whatever, which is

13:40.560 --> 13:41.560
true.

13:41.560 --> 13:44.200
I mean, they've got tons of different publishers already.

13:44.200 --> 13:50.240
Yeah, I just think it's all just strategic right now trying to get the acquisition to

13:50.240 --> 13:54.640
go through and we'll see what actually happens.

13:54.640 --> 13:57.520
What's developing in court, though, is very interesting.

13:57.520 --> 13:58.520
That's for sure.

13:58.520 --> 14:03.320
There's, you know, now it's the whole trying to get Sony to show their cards too, right?

14:03.320 --> 14:08.840
It's I, I'm kind of surprised and I'm, you know, I'm going to be fully honest, I'm not

14:08.840 --> 14:12.360
sure how this all works in civil court.

14:12.360 --> 14:14.720
But I and I'm not a lawyer, right?

14:14.720 --> 14:19.160
You know, so I'm fully willing to admit my ignorance, which a lot of people that talk

14:19.160 --> 14:20.960
about video games aren't willing to do.

14:20.960 --> 14:23.040
So I'm just putting that on the table up front.

14:23.040 --> 14:24.040
Okay.

14:24.040 --> 14:28.840
I would think that in a civil court, a judge could like gag order some of these secrets

14:28.840 --> 14:31.560
that yes, they need to be discussed in the courtroom.

14:31.560 --> 14:35.160
But there's going to be a gag order on it so that these secrets don't get released outside

14:35.160 --> 14:36.160
the courtroom.

14:36.160 --> 14:38.800
And I don't know if there's just a concern that somebody is going to leak it or what's

14:38.800 --> 14:39.800
what's going on.

14:39.800 --> 14:40.800
I mean,

14:40.800 --> 14:46.160
could they I don't know if the European Union has like an equivalent of like, Freedom of

14:46.160 --> 14:52.920
Information Act type requests or whatever, where you can do that, like to reveal the

14:52.920 --> 14:54.400
secrets, I guess, if you will.

14:54.400 --> 14:58.260
Yeah, but some secrets to I think about all the things that the former president's been

14:58.260 --> 15:02.600
doing in court, and there's a lot of it and all the redacted documents that come out of

15:02.600 --> 15:03.600
that granted.

15:03.600 --> 15:05.880
Now, I do know a lot of that is criminal.

15:05.880 --> 15:08.320
And because of who it involves, you know,

15:08.320 --> 15:11.400
it's also ongoing, like, you know, stuff.

15:11.400 --> 15:16.080
So like, if it's done, then that would probably be released.

15:16.080 --> 15:17.080
I could see that.

15:17.080 --> 15:19.720
It's like national security stuff.

15:19.720 --> 15:22.940
I guess, yeah, video games are not national security, believe it or not.

15:22.940 --> 15:28.240
So no matter what Sony and Microsoft, you believe they're not that important.

15:28.240 --> 15:33.820
Do I mean, does the public I'm going to ask a really weird question here.

15:33.820 --> 15:37.680
Does the public have a right to know what Sony's paying for this stuff?

15:37.680 --> 15:42.480
I kind of think the public should know some of this stuff.

15:42.480 --> 15:45.820
Like, you know, I don't think it changes anything at the end of the day.

15:45.820 --> 15:48.800
It's not like somebody's gonna be like, well, I'm not gonna buy a PlayStation five because

15:48.800 --> 15:49.960
Sony does this.

15:49.960 --> 15:54.560
I kind of feel like some of this transparency ought to be out on the table.

15:54.560 --> 15:55.560
I don't know.

15:55.560 --> 16:03.040
Yeah, because it gives the impression like, assuming that say you it's it's, I don't think

16:03.040 --> 16:10.560
anyone's really thinking this like, you know, like with I don't know, like, basically, what

16:10.560 --> 16:14.920
I'm saying is, like, if you take like a game, then put it like, if I'm picking a specific

16:14.920 --> 16:19.400
platform to release it on, you could, you know, draw the conclusion like, well, I picked

16:19.400 --> 16:23.840
the better platform to release it on, because I think this is a stronger platform overall.

16:23.840 --> 16:28.400
But if you don't see that there's a money being exchanged, or how much money is being

16:28.400 --> 16:32.940
exchanged, you might think, Oh, well, you know, this platform is just better.

16:32.940 --> 16:36.160
That's why I mean, sure, they may have paid a little bit, but like, this platform is just

16:36.160 --> 16:39.240
better because that's why they're that's why Square is choosing to release their games

16:39.240 --> 16:40.820
on Sony's platform.

16:40.820 --> 16:44.880
But if it ends up, it's like, Oh, yeah, but they're also getting like, $200 million or

16:44.880 --> 16:48.800
I don't know, you know, just some stupid amount, like $20 million to release their

16:48.800 --> 16:53.600
game on that platform that may all of a sudden kind of bring a little bit more clarity to

16:53.600 --> 16:56.800
it, whether it's like, well, it's not really a better platform, it's just that they just

16:56.800 --> 16:58.460
paid him a ton of money to do that.

16:58.460 --> 17:04.340
So it's, it is important, I think, to have some of that transparency there, because yeah,

17:04.340 --> 17:06.920
it does kind of skew things a bit.

17:06.920 --> 17:10.240
You may think, Oh, well, it, you know, it's because they're good guys.

17:10.240 --> 17:14.280
No, no, not necessarily.

17:14.280 --> 17:16.040
Nobody's good in capitalism.

17:16.040 --> 17:17.040
Nobody's

17:17.040 --> 17:18.040
no, no.

17:18.040 --> 17:19.040
Yeah.

17:19.040 --> 17:20.040
And the game industry and all that stuff.

17:20.040 --> 17:21.040
Yeah.

17:21.040 --> 17:22.040
Um, let's see.

17:22.040 --> 17:24.680
Let's get some comments from chat over twitch.tv slash a vog network.

17:24.680 --> 17:29.680
DJ Rama S says Sony's dirty laundry is about to be aired and I am here for it.

17:29.680 --> 17:33.240
There are a lot of people that seem to be bringing the marshmallows and the chocolate

17:33.240 --> 17:36.120
and the graham crackers to what's about to happen in court.

17:36.120 --> 17:39.420
I don't I mean, like, again, I just see it as like a transparency thing.

17:39.420 --> 17:43.320
I don't I don't think Sony's gonna get raked over the coals for it.

17:43.360 --> 17:45.120
Like, everybody's gonna forget about it.

17:45.120 --> 17:47.100
It's gonna be just a little embarrassing.

17:47.100 --> 17:52.000
Like they're, they're gonna have to show their ass figuratively and somewhat literally.

17:52.000 --> 17:53.600
And it's gonna be a little embarrassing.

17:53.600 --> 17:55.480
But at the end of the day, it's just an ass.

17:55.480 --> 17:57.280
It's just business, right?

17:57.280 --> 18:02.160
So we know they're probably paying an obscene questionable amount of money for this or this

18:02.160 --> 18:05.180
would be under discussion in the first place.

18:05.180 --> 18:06.600
That's kind of my take on it.

18:06.600 --> 18:08.440
DJ Rama S also says it's crazy.

18:08.440 --> 18:12.360
I know people that will sell their PS fours and fives if the deal goes through.

18:13.360 --> 18:15.960
No, they're not gonna sell a play.

18:16.480 --> 18:20.040
People say the wildest shit when you put a keyboard and a monitor in front of them.

18:20.040 --> 18:21.800
People say the wildest shit.

18:22.120 --> 18:22.600
You know what?

18:22.600 --> 18:25.320
If they do it, I say buy it off of them, get a good deal.

18:26.040 --> 18:28.440
I also offer half of what it's worth.

18:28.440 --> 18:33.800
Who cares what a person like who cares what someone does with their console or not?

18:33.800 --> 18:38.240
Like, do we really need to be in the loop if someone sells their console or buys a console or

18:38.480 --> 18:40.120
like has an opinion on about something?

18:40.120 --> 18:41.000
Like, I don't care.

18:41.000 --> 18:41.800
It doesn't matter.

18:41.960 --> 18:43.240
It does not matter at all.

18:43.240 --> 18:45.520
Someone on the Internet has an opinion?

18:45.960 --> 18:47.120
They're shouting this.

18:47.120 --> 18:49.400
They're making threats like anybody cares.

18:49.440 --> 18:50.640
Nobody cares.

18:50.640 --> 18:52.040
Nobody, you know?

18:54.000 --> 18:54.720
Sorry, Rama.

18:54.720 --> 19:01.000
I know you call them your friends, but it's just like a real friend will tell you when you're acting like a fool.

19:03.120 --> 19:05.920
It's just it's it's bad.

19:05.960 --> 19:06.680
Like, I don't know.

19:06.680 --> 19:10.200
Like it to me, it's just it's like that scene at Jurassic Park.

19:10.200 --> 19:11.200
See, no one cares.

19:11.200 --> 19:11.960
No one cares.

19:11.960 --> 19:14.440
You know, we shout it from the rooftop.

19:14.440 --> 19:15.120
No one cares.

19:15.920 --> 19:18.360
The only people that care, the other people, they're just like that.

19:18.720 --> 19:21.640
So they can stick in their own little click and be stupid together.

19:21.640 --> 19:22.360
I don't really care.

19:23.080 --> 19:23.720
See, it's very.

19:24.200 --> 19:24.680
Oh, go ahead.

19:25.320 --> 19:29.360
I was going to say, like, there's literally nothing like like I always dog on like Nintendo.

19:29.360 --> 19:31.560
Like there's literally nothing Nintendo could do.

19:32.040 --> 19:34.680
OK, well, almost nothing Nintendo could do.

19:34.720 --> 19:44.640
I mean, like if they came out and said, Hey, we hate all trans people and like burn in hell, everybody, then yeah, then I may be more, you know, motivated to sell my console that I have from them.

19:44.880 --> 19:46.680
But like, yikes, hyperbole.

19:47.160 --> 19:54.120
I mean, but like aside from that, like just business decisions, like if they purchase Konami or something like that, you know, good luck with them.

19:54.840 --> 19:55.880
Like, I just wouldn't care.

19:55.880 --> 19:59.000
Like, it wouldn't be anything that they could do.

19:59.960 --> 20:05.000
Business wise, are you saying Nintendo could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and would never be held accountable for it?

20:06.360 --> 20:08.480
I mean, that's what he's saying, isn't it?

20:09.680 --> 20:11.680
I mean, I don't know, probably.

20:11.880 --> 20:17.960
And unfortunately, as much disdain as I have for the reference I just made, he wasn't wrong.

20:17.960 --> 20:18.680
Clearly.

20:20.680 --> 20:22.640
That's like the one thing he wasn't wrong on.

20:22.640 --> 20:25.120
It's just the insane idiots that follow him don't care.

20:25.120 --> 20:26.920
So, you know, but they don't care about anything.

20:27.560 --> 20:29.560
Anyway, back to chat comments.

20:29.600 --> 20:30.360
Get us back on track.

20:30.360 --> 20:37.160
Sia Tabiri says Hoegh Law, H-O-E-G Law on YouTube does a great job of going through some of the legal aspects of this.

20:38.120 --> 20:38.600
Great.

20:38.840 --> 20:39.920
I'll have to check that out.

20:39.920 --> 20:44.440
Although I always prefer reading it as opposed to having to watch a 10 minute YouTube, but I get it.

20:44.440 --> 20:46.400
It's 2023 and I need to stop being old.

20:46.400 --> 20:57.520
Questbuster says, a side note, the EU is giving the deal its blessing due to the concessions being made, and Microsoft is apparently not expected to sell certain assets to make it happen.

20:57.760 --> 21:00.840
But UK regulators are still concerned over the deal.

21:01.000 --> 21:03.320
A ruling isn't expected until April.

21:03.320 --> 21:11.880
Making a distinction here between EU and the UK, which remember, if you heard the word Brexit, those are two very different things right now.

21:11.880 --> 21:15.680
So good clarification there on that.

21:16.520 --> 21:19.920
And as Joan had a map mentions, personal information can be sealed.

21:20.160 --> 21:22.360
Everything else is public record.

21:22.520 --> 21:23.680
At least it should be.

21:23.680 --> 21:27.400
That's that's we are talking about publicly traded companies.

21:27.680 --> 21:29.520
That is a good perspective on that.

21:29.520 --> 21:30.440
So thank you for that.

21:32.120 --> 21:39.840
Questbuster says Sony's deals will make news like when people found out about how much Epic paid for their exclusives during their bout with Apple.

21:40.040 --> 21:46.040
Oh, yeah, I remember there's a big spreadsheet from Epic that made the news and then it was like, wow, and then it was gone.

21:46.040 --> 21:48.000
And I bet people hardly remember it.

21:48.000 --> 21:52.520
And it's going to be the same thing with Sony is like, wow, it's your ass.

21:52.520 --> 21:55.760
And then everybody will forget the next week because that's the way the Internet works.

21:55.760 --> 22:03.680
Just like anyone remember when, you know, PlayStation online was down for, you know, a couple months or whatever years ago, like anybody remember that?

22:03.680 --> 22:04.560
Yes. Yes.

22:04.560 --> 22:07.920
No, that was Sony showing hole when that happened.

22:07.920 --> 22:15.040
That was that was the black hole of PlayStation Network when that whole thing happened and everybody forgot that.

22:15.040 --> 22:16.320
So there it is.

22:18.240 --> 22:22.400
Let's see, as Joe and Matt says, but this is all part of business.

22:22.520 --> 22:27.160
If the roles were reversed, Microsoft will be making heck for Sony if they were buying ABK.

22:27.360 --> 22:33.800
One difference I think Sony would not be as generous as Microsoft is with Call of Duty exclusivity.

22:33.960 --> 22:37.120
And I know they would not absolutely not.

22:37.360 --> 22:39.120
Absolutely not for sure.

22:39.720 --> 22:48.200
So let's see, Zen Monkey 11 says, I said I wouldn't buy any more Xbox consoles after 360 and I still haven't.

22:48.440 --> 22:52.000
I have an Xbox controller, though, and Game Pass, lol.

22:52.320 --> 22:58.760
Well, that's not a total loss for Microsoft, but I think you're admitting to that in your own what you're saying there.

22:58.760 --> 22:59.760
So I'll leave it at that.

23:00.760 --> 23:06.920
Mike Deff says console wars do exist and we're seeing it with all this ordeal, but we're not the soldiers fighting it.

23:06.920 --> 23:08.800
We're just the innocent bystanders.

23:09.000 --> 23:09.920
Interesting person.

23:10.160 --> 23:12.800
The console wars these days sure aren't what it used to be.

23:12.800 --> 23:19.720
I remember the I'm sure all of us old gamers remember the full page ads, Genesis does what Intend don't and all those things.

23:19.920 --> 23:24.520
And it definitely feels like the console wars aren't fought by marketing teams anymore.

23:24.520 --> 23:27.640
They're fought by social media people and YouTube people.

23:27.640 --> 23:29.120
And it's exhausting.

23:29.360 --> 23:35.200
Like now we all look at that and go, this is even more ridiculous than some of those game ads we used to see.

23:35.200 --> 23:39.480
And let me tell you, there were some ridiculous magazine game ads back in the day.

23:39.480 --> 23:42.400
If you've not seen any, there's a whole internet out there.

23:42.400 --> 23:45.200
Go look at some of these ridiculous game ads and tell me what you think.

23:45.600 --> 23:52.640
So Bobby Black Wolf also says they want Xbox to be a platform, not a console.

23:52.840 --> 23:55.600
The fact you have Game Pass means they got what they wanted from you.

23:55.600 --> 23:56.080
Yes.

23:56.600 --> 24:00.080
And Quest Buster says so much shade in those magazine ads.

24:00.080 --> 24:03.040
I remember the Final Fantasy 7 ad that mocked cartridges.

24:03.240 --> 24:08.120
Oh, yeah, it was always it was it was always something anyway.

24:08.160 --> 24:08.560
All right.

24:08.680 --> 24:16.240
Well, let's talk about the ads that worked on us as we talk about the video games that we've been playing this week in a segment called How Was Your Gaming Week?

24:16.400 --> 24:16.920
Dark Soccer.

24:16.920 --> 24:19.960
And if you want, you can do How Was Your Gaming two weeks because it has been a minute.

24:20.160 --> 24:21.840
So Dark Soccer, how was your gaming week?

24:23.120 --> 24:25.920
Well, it was the usual stuff.

24:25.920 --> 24:27.480
There was some Dead by Daylight.

24:28.240 --> 24:32.200
I tried to play Star Ocean, but my controllers kind of fucked up.

24:33.720 --> 24:41.080
Like this that has served me well for like the last eight or nine years or no less than that, more like seven.

24:41.080 --> 24:42.080
But anyway, it's been a while.

24:42.920 --> 24:46.320
My right shoulder button's been out for a while and now it's making other buttons stick.

24:46.720 --> 24:48.080
So I ordered another one.

24:50.080 --> 24:54.800
And so I actually played Cult of the Lamb instead.

24:54.800 --> 24:57.400
And it was it was nice revisiting Cult of the Lamb.

24:58.400 --> 25:02.720
Have they done any content updates, patches, extra things to that game since the...

25:02.720 --> 25:07.120
It's just that there's supposed to be a new a new DLC for it coming out.

25:07.280 --> 25:07.800
Oh, cool.

25:08.640 --> 25:14.120
So I'm hoping that it's it's going to be good.

25:14.120 --> 25:17.520
Like they said, there's supposed to be like new buildings in the game that you can make.

25:19.360 --> 25:22.320
So I'm still doing Dead by Daylight.

25:22.320 --> 25:24.920
I hit Eerie four, which made me happy.

25:25.680 --> 25:27.440
Um, thanks.

25:28.520 --> 25:36.680
OK, and I made actually I made friends with somebody I bought stickers from on Etsy, who actually, for those who are watching, did this.

25:37.520 --> 25:38.280
Oh, cute.

25:38.720 --> 25:45.160
A little Susie and I have a pig that's at my at my desk at work and also did this.

25:46.120 --> 25:49.000
Which is for the podcast, there's an artwork of the pig.

25:49.000 --> 25:52.440
Yeah, but I bought some stickers and

25:53.440 --> 25:58.120
the Kaim that my new friend has been swiffing with us.

25:58.120 --> 26:02.280
So the the the team Yeet grows.

26:04.560 --> 26:07.920
And what did I do?

26:07.920 --> 26:11.680
I played some Midnight Suns, you know, kind of slowly easing my way back into it.

26:11.680 --> 26:15.640
It's just being back to work has kind of broken my concentration for stuff.

26:15.640 --> 26:17.800
So I'm like easing my brain back into things.

26:17.960 --> 26:20.440
So, oh, yeah.

26:20.440 --> 26:23.480
And I played a little bit more Beatlemania.

26:24.280 --> 26:26.320
I love that table.

26:26.320 --> 26:33.680
It's like the 1964 era of Beatles music, but it's done like one of those old school pinball tables.

26:33.680 --> 26:40.280
It's got like the big curved end in the open play field and but with enough modern touches that it's really fresh.

26:40.720 --> 26:47.320
And then we watched a thing, but I guess I'm talking about it later in the show, so I'll be quiet about it.

26:48.280 --> 26:50.480
OK, fair enough. Yeah.

26:50.680 --> 26:53.320
All right. Well, then with that, I'll go over to Loki.

26:53.320 --> 26:54.880
How was your gaming week?

26:54.880 --> 26:57.360
I just played Minecraft one edited video.

26:57.360 --> 27:02.360
So like I had an episode come out on the 24th, I believe.

27:02.880 --> 27:05.560
So my modded series and that was fun.

27:05.880 --> 27:09.000
I built a starter house there

27:09.000 --> 27:12.160
and then I've been working on

27:13.800 --> 27:15.520
making flowers

27:16.520 --> 27:17.600
in Minecraft.

27:17.600 --> 27:20.240
OK. Oh, giant flowers.

27:20.880 --> 27:21.720
All right.

27:21.720 --> 27:23.960
I'll see what that's all about in your next video.

27:24.640 --> 27:28.000
It's it's the new the new robot master.

27:28.000 --> 27:29.080
Oh, actually, I'm sorry.

27:29.080 --> 27:31.120
There was a whole lot of stuff that went on. OK.

27:32.200 --> 27:33.440
So let me let me back up here.

27:33.440 --> 27:34.560
So a few things.

27:35.920 --> 27:40.120
So first off, I have my eight robot masters.

27:40.120 --> 27:41.280
I part my series.

27:41.280 --> 27:47.120
I'm building a Mega Man theme this on the season on the channel 64 S&P,

27:48.040 --> 27:50.760
which is cool because I tried to pick like the beginning season.

27:50.960 --> 27:54.320
I wanted to pick a unique

27:54.320 --> 27:57.920
build theme style or whatever that nobody has done before,

27:57.920 --> 28:02.440
because I knew like everybody picks like, you know, I do cyberpunk

28:02.440 --> 28:05.800
or I'm going to do steampunk or cottage core or something like that.

28:06.320 --> 28:09.040
So I was like, OK, Mega Man, no one's done Mega Man

28:09.080 --> 28:10.120
because I've looked online.

28:10.120 --> 28:12.320
All I see is like pixel art stuff that people copy.

28:12.640 --> 28:14.720
No one's actually done Mega Man.

28:14.720 --> 28:18.840
So I picked Mega Man and I have my eight robot masters

28:18.840 --> 28:23.200
that commissioned and created custom robot masters based off of the mobs

28:23.200 --> 28:23.880
in Minecraft.

28:23.880 --> 28:26.120
So the second one I'm working on right now,

28:26.120 --> 28:28.000
because I finished the area for the first one.

28:28.000 --> 28:30.200
The second one is the axolotl woman.

28:30.200 --> 28:32.200
And she is like super cute.

28:32.200 --> 28:36.400
She's got like this robotic axolotl thing that looks really derpy.

28:36.400 --> 28:38.960
Kind of almost looks like a duck billed platypus or something like that.

28:40.840 --> 28:42.920
But her area has like giant flowers in it.

28:42.920 --> 28:46.160
Originally, I was going to be basing it off of the hanging gardens of Babylon,

28:46.160 --> 28:48.840
but then I put that together and it didn't quite look right.

28:49.200 --> 28:51.480
It wasn't like robotic enough.

28:51.480 --> 28:55.240
So I've started now with robotic flowers that are going to be basically

28:55.240 --> 28:58.640
these giant solar arrays or solar panel arrays,

28:59.080 --> 29:02.880
which look really cool, even though it took a week to put together.

29:03.680 --> 29:05.040
But that aside,

29:05.040 --> 29:07.560
so a couple of things happen while that was all going on.

29:08.480 --> 29:09.040
So.

29:10.000 --> 29:14.480
Mojang decided that, hey, we're going to put out some Mega Man X DLC for.

29:14.880 --> 29:16.000
That's right.

29:16.000 --> 29:18.120
Minecraft Bedrock.

29:18.120 --> 29:21.320
So I was like, that sounds like an opportunity for me.

29:21.320 --> 29:24.520
So I was like, OK, hey, hey, you like that DLC?

29:24.520 --> 29:25.320
Well, guess what?

29:25.320 --> 29:28.720
Like, I've been working on this stuff and it's also making me related.

29:28.720 --> 29:31.600
And so I got, you know, some retweets and stuff like that.

29:32.120 --> 29:34.320
A couple of the developers noticed as well.

29:34.920 --> 29:38.120
Then they decided that they're going to do this new thing.

29:38.120 --> 29:40.880
It's called a feature me Minecraft.

29:41.600 --> 29:44.240
And what's the first theme that they pick?

29:44.880 --> 29:46.400
It's Mega Man.

29:46.400 --> 29:49.960
Who has Mega Man builds out the wazoo because he's been working on for six months?

29:50.120 --> 29:51.080
This guy.

29:51.080 --> 29:54.640
So it's going to there's a very good possibility

29:54.640 --> 29:57.840
that I'll probably be featured on Minecraft's website here.

29:57.880 --> 29:59.080
Oh, my God.

29:59.080 --> 30:03.320
Finally, I'm so happy to see what have we been telling you

30:03.360 --> 30:04.080
for the longest time.

30:04.080 --> 30:06.160
You stick with it and there's going to be something

30:06.160 --> 30:08.720
that finally comes through and helps you get that push in.

30:09.040 --> 30:10.200
I know we'll see what that does.

30:10.200 --> 30:12.120
I know we don't want to set the expectations too high,

30:12.120 --> 30:16.040
but I mean, the fact that developers saw it, Loki, that's huge. That's huge.

30:16.600 --> 30:19.400
Yeah. So like, yeah, it's pretty awesome.

30:20.000 --> 30:22.360
So, yeah, I've been just plugging away at that stuff.

30:22.360 --> 30:25.600
And I think I've got a good start, obviously,

30:25.600 --> 30:28.560
because I've got some pretty big builds already that I've,

30:28.920 --> 30:32.880
you know, captured in everything and, you know, tagged in that.

30:32.880 --> 30:35.320
And there's not really I haven't really seen any other submissions

30:35.320 --> 30:36.960
on Twitter yet.

30:36.960 --> 30:38.800
And it ends in like 10 days.

30:38.800 --> 30:43.000
So, I mean, oh, man, I'm so happy for you preemptively.

30:43.320 --> 30:45.120
Maybe I need to calm down what.

30:45.120 --> 30:48.440
But since that did come out during the week we were out, I'm kind of curious,

30:48.440 --> 30:50.920
like, what are your thoughts in general on the Mega Man crossover?

30:50.920 --> 30:52.560
Because it looks kind of cool.

30:52.560 --> 30:55.320
Yeah, I'm like, I'm not a huge Minecraft guy like you are.

30:55.320 --> 30:57.440
And I was like, oh, I should fire up Minecraft and check that out.

30:57.840 --> 30:59.600
Yeah, it's they've been doing a lot of these

30:59.600 --> 31:02.480
like different things where they'll have maps that they make

31:02.960 --> 31:05.680
they're like DLCs, but it's basically maps that they make

31:05.680 --> 31:07.960
that have different like gameplay like.

31:07.960 --> 31:10.680
So they did one not that long ago of like Sonic.

31:11.120 --> 31:14.240
And it actually plays a bit like Sonic, like you're running

31:14.600 --> 31:16.560
really fast and stuff like that.

31:16.560 --> 31:19.720
The Mega Man X one, I think, is similar to Mega Man X as well.

31:19.720 --> 31:22.240
I think you can actually like shoot

31:22.240 --> 31:25.160
your Buster and like even like a fight.

31:25.160 --> 31:27.320
Some of the enemies of I haven't actually played the X.

31:27.320 --> 31:30.760
I don't play a lot of bedrock, but I may have to check it out.

31:30.760 --> 31:31.960
It looks pretty cool.

31:31.960 --> 31:34.680
And the aesthetic was definitely, you know, Mega Man.

31:34.680 --> 31:36.840
So I don't know.

31:36.840 --> 31:40.120
I don't know how many of like the stages they recreated in there as well.

31:40.320 --> 31:42.680
And that'd be kind of interesting because it's kind of 2D.

31:42.680 --> 31:44.560
I'm not sure if they like fix the camera angles.

31:44.560 --> 31:45.520
So it's like side scrolling

31:45.520 --> 31:48.720
because in the trailer kind of look like is a little mix of both.

31:48.720 --> 31:50.320
So maybe.

31:50.320 --> 31:53.960
But I know all the updates that they've been doing for like 120 and stuff.

31:53.960 --> 31:56.480
They're supposed to be coming out, I imagine pretty soon.

31:57.480 --> 31:59.960
Having kind of based on like

32:00.000 --> 32:02.200
adding more robust

32:02.200 --> 32:04.960
customization for these map packs, because I mean,

32:04.960 --> 32:07.680
that's really where their bread and butter is with that.

32:07.680 --> 32:10.360
I mean, because they're not making money off the Java version of Minecraft.

32:10.360 --> 32:13.000
You buy it once, like 10 years ago, and then that's it.

32:13.800 --> 32:19.600
It's all the map and, you know, DLC and custom.

32:20.520 --> 32:23.920
All sorts of things on their marketplace, on the bedrock side of things,

32:23.920 --> 32:26.080
that's basically, you know, all the mobile platforms,

32:26.080 --> 32:29.120
all the console platforms and, you know, PC as well.

32:29.120 --> 32:31.520
But I mean, I get it. I get it.

32:31.520 --> 32:34.680
So yeah, it'll be interesting to see what happens with that.

32:35.200 --> 32:37.800
The very least, I got a few people looking at stuff.

32:37.800 --> 32:41.240
I mean, like, I just think it's like you're like, you know, 2023,

32:41.240 --> 32:43.920
like who actually goes out to the Minecraft website?

32:43.920 --> 32:45.200
Like, I don't know.

32:45.200 --> 32:48.880
So we'll see if they feature in like surprise different videos and stuff.

32:48.880 --> 32:50.520
I mean, it'd be cool.

32:50.520 --> 32:52.040
At least they'll be on there now.

32:52.040 --> 32:54.400
So it also puts you in their orbit.

32:54.720 --> 32:55.880
And that's true.

32:55.880 --> 32:57.720
Yeah, that's that's the other important thing, too.

32:57.720 --> 33:00.480
It gets you noticed by the people that can help elevate you.

33:00.480 --> 33:03.360
It's it's I again, I'm trying not to put the cart before the horse.

33:03.360 --> 33:04.240
Let's see what happens.

33:04.240 --> 33:07.160
But I will I'm going to check your Twitter.

33:07.520 --> 33:10.400
I'm not as good at checking Twitter

33:10.400 --> 33:12.960
as I used to be for reasons I've talked about prior on this show.

33:12.960 --> 33:15.720
I'm a little more on the Mastodon bandwagon at this point, but I'm

33:16.080 --> 33:19.800
I will make it a point to check your Twitter regularly

33:19.800 --> 33:22.000
to see what happens of this, because I'm dying to know.

33:22.440 --> 33:25.720
Yeah, I mean, it's got was it the post that I responded

33:25.720 --> 33:28.000
to their build challenge tweet.

33:28.000 --> 33:32.400
It's got about 4100 views on it and like 85 likes.

33:33.080 --> 33:35.080
Oh, that's that's great.

33:35.680 --> 33:37.240
So, yeah, it's not bad.

33:37.240 --> 33:39.560
OK. All right. All right.

33:39.920 --> 33:44.080
Well, Loki's soon going to be the next big YouTuber and he's going to

33:45.640 --> 33:47.040
going to say, fuck this show.

33:47.040 --> 33:48.000
I'm big timer now.

33:48.000 --> 33:49.720
No, I'm kidding. He wouldn't. I know he wouldn't. All right.

33:51.080 --> 33:53.840
All right. Hey, done, done, done, done.

33:54.320 --> 33:57.280
All right. Moving on, I'll talk quickly.

33:57.520 --> 33:59.000
I'm assuming that's it for your gaming week.

33:59.000 --> 34:00.480
I mean, yeah, that's it.

34:00.480 --> 34:03.520
That's a pretty difficult thing to follow up my gaming week.

34:03.520 --> 34:05.040
I didn't play a lot of games this week.

34:05.040 --> 34:08.280
Y'all know why I was focusing on just having a good time on the boat

34:08.280 --> 34:09.120
and being social.

34:09.120 --> 34:11.720
I met a lot of new people, but we'll get into that on Thursday.

34:12.600 --> 34:16.440
But when I got home, because we've been home since Friday,

34:16.440 --> 34:17.600
it was a Friday to Friday cruise.

34:17.600 --> 34:19.360
So we've been home since Friday.

34:19.360 --> 34:21.920
I have been playing quite a bit of Diablo three.

34:22.440 --> 34:23.440
Yep, I'm back on that.

34:23.440 --> 34:28.040
But because they put out a brand new season last week while I was out of town.

34:28.280 --> 34:31.560
So season twenty eight started and the big new thing was season

34:31.560 --> 34:33.680
twenty eight is that they have this new altar.

34:33.680 --> 34:36.520
So they have like a talent progression thing on the altar,

34:36.520 --> 34:40.240
which is similar to what Diablo four has in store.

34:40.240 --> 34:43.480
So it's a little bit of a tie in to Diablo four's release because this

34:43.760 --> 34:45.960
they haven't said this is the last season.

34:46.520 --> 34:49.160
But my assumption is season 30

34:49.480 --> 34:53.160
will probably be like a good number for them to end on,

34:53.160 --> 34:54.880
which would be like that forever.

34:54.880 --> 34:58.320
So they'll find a mechanic that they can run perpetually at that point.

34:58.960 --> 35:01.000
So they're probably getting closer and closer to that.

35:01.000 --> 35:02.880
But I am having fun with Diablo three.

35:02.880 --> 35:04.680
Some of the builds have changed a lot.

35:04.680 --> 35:06.040
It's kind of added some new things.

35:06.040 --> 35:10.560
It's really fast to level now because the first talent you get doubles

35:10.560 --> 35:11.760
the massacre bonus.

35:11.760 --> 35:15.240
What's called is when you kill a lot of enemies in succession.

35:15.400 --> 35:19.120
And so if you just kind of grind these certain maps, you can level up very fast.

35:19.360 --> 35:21.200
So, yeah, I've just been enjoying Diablo three.

35:21.200 --> 35:24.120
But honestly, that's like the only game I've really played since I got back.

35:24.560 --> 35:27.720
Oh, I did play one round of Dead by Daylight last night, one round

35:27.720 --> 35:29.520
to get my challenge done.

35:29.520 --> 35:33.160
I had to sabo four hooks and get chased as Kate Denson.

35:33.600 --> 35:36.840
But I was up against a Wesker who couldn't chase and never chase

35:36.840 --> 35:39.240
me the entire match.

35:39.240 --> 35:41.080
So I saboed my hooks, though.

35:41.080 --> 35:43.600
Yeah, it was a baby, but that's OK.

35:44.880 --> 35:47.160
When I see babies, you know what I do?

35:47.200 --> 35:49.840
I don't teabag. I just leave the fucking match.

35:49.880 --> 35:52.160
That's what I do when I see babies.

35:52.160 --> 35:55.320
I've noticed, though, like a lot of baby killers these days.

35:55.360 --> 35:57.120
Yeah. And I'm a baby killer, too.

35:57.120 --> 36:02.440
So, well, I mean, but I'm more like my thing is like

36:03.360 --> 36:06.640
like I've seen them do the camping crap.

36:07.400 --> 36:09.600
Oh, so I will stay afterwards.

36:09.600 --> 36:12.360
And if there if there's something I can communicate with,

36:13.080 --> 36:15.360
I will usually let them have it.

36:15.360 --> 36:19.880
This this Wesker tried to camp the final hook after the exits were open,

36:19.880 --> 36:21.640
but actually allowed.

36:21.640 --> 36:25.000
Actually, he did get one of the survivors out because they fucked around

36:25.000 --> 36:29.760
and found out and they they got slammed into the exit gate.

36:29.760 --> 36:32.320
They forgot that Wesker can slam you into the exit gate.

36:32.760 --> 36:34.680
That was and that was not the play.

36:34.680 --> 36:36.800
They fucked around. They found out. So.

36:36.800 --> 36:39.640
Exactly. You know, but you know what I say?

36:39.640 --> 36:43.920
You know the when the gates are open, all bets are off. Yeah. Yeah.

36:45.360 --> 36:47.080
So anyway, that was really it for my gaming week.

36:47.080 --> 36:49.000
You know, another big thing that I missed this week,

36:49.000 --> 36:51.440
No Man's Sky put out a new expedition.

36:51.440 --> 36:52.880
I do plan to check that out.

36:52.880 --> 36:55.840
I'm going to stream that on Tuesday on my personal channel for a little bit.

36:56.600 --> 36:58.760
But yeah, otherwise,

37:00.520 --> 37:01.320
I didn't get it.

37:01.320 --> 37:06.760
That's the first time that I've ever missed a No Man's Sky Twitch drops campaign.

37:06.960 --> 37:10.640
I've been I've collected every reward from every other Twitch campaign.

37:10.640 --> 37:13.800
I missed this one completely because I was on a boat.

37:14.680 --> 37:16.040
So that's that.

37:16.040 --> 37:18.760
So before we get anything to be sorry.

37:18.760 --> 37:20.920
No, it really isn't. It really isn't.

37:20.920 --> 37:23.800
And I'll tell you more on Thursday. I'm on a boat.

37:24.120 --> 37:26.480
Yeah. Yeah. I'll tell you more on Thursday.

37:26.480 --> 37:28.400
Just the celebrities they had this year were great.

37:28.400 --> 37:30.520
So personable, approachable.

37:30.520 --> 37:32.920
Like I'll give you a little tease.

37:32.920 --> 37:36.760
I know you you interviewed Todd Stashwick on a podcast

37:36.760 --> 37:38.440
some time ago and have kept in touch.

37:38.440 --> 37:40.560
He was extremely well received by the crowd.

37:40.560 --> 37:44.440
He did a great job with like he introduced the new episode of Picard,

37:44.800 --> 37:46.880
which we got to watch in a big group.

37:47.160 --> 37:49.480
And it was it was like being at the Rocky Horror Picture Show.

37:49.480 --> 37:51.360
But Star Trek, it was great.

37:51.360 --> 37:53.640
And like, I'm not going to spoil anything that happened in the episode,

37:53.640 --> 37:56.840
but I will just say there is there is Crusher

37:57.160 --> 37:59.360
and there's a doctor who's not as likable.

37:59.600 --> 38:03.320
And when the doctor who's not as likable showed up, somebody in the back went,

38:03.800 --> 38:06.520
bitch, everybody started laughing.

38:07.200 --> 38:10.160
So it's like Pulaski.

38:10.200 --> 38:11.440
No, no, no. It's not Pulaski.

38:11.440 --> 38:12.760
It's because it's Pulaski.

38:12.760 --> 38:14.320
No, no, it's somebody completely different.

38:14.320 --> 38:16.600
So again, I don't want to spoil.

38:16.600 --> 38:20.720
So, oh, no, no, it's I don't think you would know it's different.

38:21.000 --> 38:23.080
So anyway, I'll just leave it at that.

38:23.080 --> 38:24.800
For those that are watching Picard, you'll get it.

38:24.800 --> 38:26.840
For those that aren't, you won't. And that's the point.

38:27.760 --> 38:29.800
But it was really fun to watch that at a crowd.

38:29.800 --> 38:33.960
And I will say the last night of the cruise,

38:34.560 --> 38:37.520
Tawny Newsome, who voices Mariner on Lower Decks,

38:37.920 --> 38:40.720
she is on fire with her improv.

38:40.760 --> 38:41.920
She's so good.

38:41.920 --> 38:44.720
But she was a late add to the cruise because she was the other one

38:44.720 --> 38:46.400
they added when Kate Mulgrew backed out.

38:46.400 --> 38:50.400
So when Kate Mulgrew had to back out, they added Shatner and Tawny Newsome.

38:50.440 --> 38:52.360
Yay. Tawny Newsome.

38:52.360 --> 38:54.840
You can tell that they must have went to her and said,

38:55.120 --> 38:57.480
what event do you want to host on the boat?

38:57.480 --> 38:59.600
You can do anything you want. What do you want to do?

38:59.600 --> 39:02.960
So the last night of the cruise, I went to a Beyonce

39:02.960 --> 39:06.240
Renaissance album dance party hosted by Tawny Newsome.

39:07.200 --> 39:09.880
That sounded amazing.

39:09.880 --> 39:13.240
I will treasure those types of moments forever.

39:13.520 --> 39:18.360
That is it was it was everything like I literally had to sit down and go.

39:18.960 --> 39:20.280
Is this real life?

39:20.280 --> 39:21.600
This is incredible.

39:21.600 --> 39:23.640
So more stories like that on Thursday.

39:23.640 --> 39:24.960
I'll leave you with that tease.

39:24.960 --> 39:27.280
So that's pretty awesome.

39:27.280 --> 39:29.800
Also, I will mention I forgot

39:29.800 --> 39:32.840
I was going to bring this up on the toss call with Bobby Black Wolf,

39:33.360 --> 39:35.240
but we can talk about it more in depth next week.

39:35.240 --> 39:37.480
But I will just also confirm

39:37.480 --> 39:41.240
Bobby and myself will be at Dragon Con 2023.

39:41.240 --> 39:42.400
I mean, no surprise there, right?

39:42.400 --> 39:44.160
You kind of knew that was coming.

39:44.160 --> 39:47.280
Just confirming we are both going to be professional

39:47.560 --> 39:50.800
attending professionals once again, which means we will have a variety of panels

39:51.360 --> 39:54.400
that you can come watch and do all the good stuff with. And

39:55.320 --> 39:57.680
I know this is going to 100 percent happen

39:57.680 --> 40:01.080
because the flights have been booked as of this last week.

40:01.480 --> 40:04.560
Alan is going to his first Dragon Con this year.

40:04.600 --> 40:08.040
So it's not just and it's not just me going, it's Alan going.

40:08.040 --> 40:11.000
And I'm I'm trying to talk Alan into doing a panel.

40:11.120 --> 40:15.440
But he's he he's not there yet mentally, but I'm hoping I can get him there.

40:15.440 --> 40:17.680
I would love for him to just be a panelist on one panel.

40:17.920 --> 40:19.120
I think he would be so good.

40:19.120 --> 40:20.840
So we'll see. I'm going to try.

40:20.840 --> 40:21.840
I'm going to keep trying.

40:21.840 --> 40:25.680
But look forward to that in Atlanta over Labor Day weekend.

40:25.680 --> 40:26.880
So there's that.

40:26.880 --> 40:30.120
So D.J. Rama says, is Alan cosplaying?

40:30.560 --> 40:33.480
That's a great question, actually.

40:34.880 --> 40:36.480
Not yet.

40:36.480 --> 40:40.240
But I think Alan and I are going to need to invest in some Starfleet uniforms

40:40.240 --> 40:44.200
because we already booked for next year's Star Trek Cruise.

40:46.200 --> 40:50.560
So so no show February 20 something 2024.

40:50.640 --> 40:53.120
Just get that out there now.

40:53.120 --> 40:56.200
The same week in February next year, you're you're going to have off again.

40:58.080 --> 41:03.120
Still, I think that you should show DS9 some love because it was the best.

41:03.400 --> 41:05.880
This whole cruise was DS9 love.

41:05.880 --> 41:08.440
I have a photo with the cast of DS9. I'll have to show it to you.

41:09.080 --> 41:10.280
It was great.

41:10.280 --> 41:13.960
And we got to do we got to do a charity breakfast with Chase Masterson,

41:13.960 --> 41:16.600
who played Lita on a lot of episodes.

41:16.600 --> 41:20.400
And she she does a great anti-bullying charity called Be Kind.

41:20.400 --> 41:22.680
And she talks a lot about that. Anyway, I'm getting off track.

41:23.000 --> 41:24.880
Join us Thursday. We'll talk more about that.

41:24.880 --> 41:26.640
But yes, Deep Space Nine was well represented

41:26.640 --> 41:28.600
because they were it was the 30th anniversary.

41:28.600 --> 41:31.480
So they had a lot of the cast there. It was really cool.

41:31.600 --> 41:33.360
That's absolutely my favorite series.

41:33.360 --> 41:37.120
It's it's it's interesting how that series is getting a lot more love now.

41:37.120 --> 41:41.520
They're saying that streaming really helped that series out a lot

41:41.520 --> 41:44.080
and get the credit that it deserved, that it wasn't getting before.

41:44.080 --> 41:45.000
It's very interesting.

41:46.520 --> 41:49.520
Let's see. Jaskren says hell yeah to Alan being there.

41:49.520 --> 41:51.040
I know Jaskren goes to Dragon Con.

41:51.040 --> 41:53.040
Yeah, I'm really excited about that, too, as well.

41:53.920 --> 41:59.120
YYR asking kind of a out of the blue question, but I like this.

41:59.120 --> 42:02.000
So let me ask this question before or answer this question

42:02.000 --> 42:03.920
before we get into the stories tonight.

42:04.120 --> 42:08.240
YYR says, did anyone else catch the DDR tournament

42:08.240 --> 42:10.800
last night on the Ohio DDR Twitch channel?

42:10.920 --> 42:12.600
It was mind blowing.

42:12.600 --> 42:16.720
The new players coming on up to the pinnacle of human skill are just amazing.

42:16.880 --> 42:19.160
And my short answer is no.

42:19.160 --> 42:22.400
But my long answer is I wish I'd known about it and I would have.

42:22.440 --> 42:24.760
But probably because, again, I'd been out for a week.

42:24.760 --> 42:26.800
Of course, I didn't know about it.

42:26.800 --> 42:30.680
But I do think it's fascinating that because these things can be streamed,

42:30.960 --> 42:32.000
you know, I think back.

42:32.000 --> 42:36.120
OK, so I was like, they didn't really stream DDR contest back in the day.

42:36.120 --> 42:38.400
You had to wait for the videos to be published later.

42:38.400 --> 42:42.960
But remember the DDR tournament at Pier 39?

42:42.960 --> 42:44.600
It was called B3.

42:44.600 --> 42:47.600
There was a live stream of that tournament. Who did it?

42:48.920 --> 42:50.600
Us at Orange Launch Radio.

42:50.600 --> 42:53.000
It's our first major on location event.

42:53.000 --> 42:57.520
Run off off with with a mutual friend for lunch.

42:58.320 --> 43:01.960
And I think that was when we gave the microphone to Jahi, if you remember him.

43:01.960 --> 43:04.160
And he just he just ran the show for like two hours.

43:04.160 --> 43:06.560
And I'm sure it was amazing.

43:06.560 --> 43:09.240
I miss that guy, too. So funny.

43:09.240 --> 43:13.640
But anyway, what else is it going to say about that tournament?

43:13.680 --> 43:16.160
Oh, there was no video back then because this is ancient times.

43:16.160 --> 43:18.160
It was like 2004. We didn't have the Internet for video.

43:18.160 --> 43:21.160
So it was like audio only. But it was really, really fun.

43:21.160 --> 43:24.520
And YYR says there were 900 people watching live towards the end.

43:24.520 --> 43:26.480
So this got noticed. That's awesome.

43:26.480 --> 43:29.880
I really want to see some DDR tournaments on Twitch.

43:29.880 --> 43:31.000
I think that's a great thing.

43:31.000 --> 43:35.040
And we know that DDR and dance games in general have been getting more visibility

43:35.200 --> 43:38.800
because of things like Games Done Quick that have done the showcases on Twitch and so forth.

43:38.800 --> 43:41.720
And not just that. There's been, you know, tournaments and lots of things.

43:41.720 --> 43:46.640
And, you know, even us olds in our 40s can that we're back.

43:46.720 --> 43:48.320
We're into DDR back in the day.

43:48.320 --> 43:52.160
We all recognize there's some new get there's some up and coming kids now.

43:52.400 --> 43:54.640
There's some new kids up and coming.

43:55.200 --> 43:57.000
Do not saying we used to do.

43:57.000 --> 44:00.120
And I think it's great. I'm glad the DDR is thriving.

44:00.120 --> 44:04.320
And I realize that, you know, round one's resurgence, getting more arcade machines out there

44:04.320 --> 44:08.320
and so forth have really helped give that game a new tailwind.

44:08.320 --> 44:10.560
And I think it's great. So, yeah.

44:10.560 --> 44:13.320
And Freestyle Takeover always streams that stuff. Yep, yep, yep.

44:13.760 --> 44:15.840
So awesome. Awesome.

44:15.840 --> 44:19.080
Yes. Please do ping the discord if you catch one of those in progress later on.

44:19.560 --> 44:21.240
All right. Let's move on.

44:21.240 --> 44:23.360
Let's get into some of the other news we missed this week.

44:23.360 --> 44:29.120
And we will go to Loki for tonight's story, which isn't directly about video games,

44:29.480 --> 44:32.720
but it kind of is. It's super adjacent.

44:32.760 --> 44:37.600
No, I have a follow up story to this from my trip, but I'm going to let you tell this.

44:38.080 --> 44:41.240
I mean, when you think about it, though, what what

44:42.240 --> 44:46.200
retail store carries the majority of these?

44:47.160 --> 44:49.280
It's a game store. It's GameStop.

44:49.560 --> 44:53.600
And we're talking about Funko Pops. GameStop's number one export nowadays.

44:53.920 --> 44:59.560
And Funko Pops maybe not doing as well as they had hoped.

45:00.000 --> 45:04.600
But apparently there is going to be 30 million

45:04.680 --> 45:07.400
dollars worth of Funko Pops heading to a landfill.

45:07.400 --> 45:09.320
It's like it's 1983 all over again.

45:09.360 --> 45:12.600
And we're burying, you know, E.T. in landfills.

45:12.600 --> 45:15.560
But no, they're going to be,

45:15.840 --> 45:19.320
I guess, dumping those because they're not able to sell them off.

45:19.880 --> 45:24.600
The inventory at the end of year totaled 20 or 246.4 million,

45:24.840 --> 45:27.640
an increase of 48 percent compared to a year ago.

45:28.320 --> 45:31.760
And says the inventory or this includes inventory that the company intends

45:31.760 --> 45:35.720
to eliminate in the first half of 2023 to reduce fulfillment costs

45:35.720 --> 45:39.120
by managing inventory levels to align with the operating

45:39.400 --> 45:42.040
operating capacity of our distribution center,

45:42.200 --> 45:45.680
because it costs money to store things in a warehouse.

45:45.680 --> 45:49.880
So therefore, it's best for them to get rid of those things in a warehouse

45:50.400 --> 45:52.920
or just, you know, don't manufacture them in the first place.

45:53.040 --> 45:57.320
Oh, they actually have canceled a bunch of series like the Dead by Daylight Pops.

45:57.320 --> 45:59.600
They were going to do, which I was super excited about.

45:59.640 --> 46:01.440
They canceled them.

46:01.440 --> 46:03.200
Yeah, because they're probably producing a lot of these.

46:03.200 --> 46:06.840
I can only imagine it would be very hard to estimate

46:06.840 --> 46:09.680
and forecast what they would need for a lot of these.

46:09.680 --> 46:16.080
And, you know, who knows when stuff either gets moved around, canceled.

46:16.120 --> 46:18.760
I mean, I don't know if they're making funko pops based off like,

46:18.960 --> 46:22.080
you know, Batgirl or anything like that, those movies. But like.

46:23.360 --> 46:25.800
I can only imagine that,

46:25.800 --> 46:29.600
you know, there's a finite amount of funko pops that a person can own

46:29.600 --> 46:31.600
or have room for, like. Right.

46:32.120 --> 46:34.440
Well, look at look at what happened with their stock prices

46:34.440 --> 46:38.160
when they announced their forecast for Q4, everything just flushed.

46:39.720 --> 46:42.480
Yeah, yeah, these things have been oversaturated for some time,

46:42.480 --> 46:45.160
like and I don't hate funko pops.

46:45.400 --> 46:48.320
I just recognize that they're they're too much.

46:48.320 --> 46:50.480
And they are this comment in chat.

46:50.880 --> 46:54.480
Dijarama says, let's be real funko over licensed properties for pops.

46:54.480 --> 46:56.440
That shouldn't be. Absolutely.

46:56.440 --> 46:58.640
And it's interesting to me.

46:58.880 --> 47:02.840
I made the little joke comparison in the sidebar here live on Twitch.

47:03.000 --> 47:06.160
They're going to join Atari 2600 properties in the garbage heap

47:06.160 --> 47:08.440
because the same thing happened to Atari back in the day.

47:08.880 --> 47:11.000
And those documentaries about them

47:11.000 --> 47:14.280
digging up copies of ET out of the landfill and stuff are really fascinating.

47:14.520 --> 47:17.080
And it's interesting that funko is meeting a similar fate.

47:17.080 --> 47:21.560
And it's it's it's the great funko crash is what we're seeing play out now.

47:22.080 --> 47:24.880
But how does this affect video games?

47:25.320 --> 47:28.000
This is going to be the final nail in the coffin for GameStop.

47:29.280 --> 47:32.760
This will absolutely be the final nail in the coffin for GameStop, I think.

47:32.800 --> 47:38.440
But it's I mean, it's all they sell nowadays, or at least mostly what they sell.

47:38.440 --> 47:43.200
You go in there and there's equal, if not more space per like you look at each.

47:43.400 --> 47:47.480
You would think that funko was its own like game console

47:47.480 --> 47:50.680
because they have more shelf space than than games.

47:50.680 --> 47:54.880
And I mean, it's understandable because they probably make more margin from that.

47:54.880 --> 47:58.160
And it comes down to just they're in survival mode over there.

47:58.200 --> 48:02.960
And. Yeah, I just I don't see it happening.

48:02.960 --> 48:05.480
They couldn't even do it when they're there.

48:06.200 --> 48:10.240
Their stock is over evaluated for like how much it's worth.

48:10.240 --> 48:14.480
And like. They couldn't even do that with that cast cash influx.

48:14.480 --> 48:19.320
It's just they still it's just not a successful business model anymore, I think.

48:19.960 --> 48:21.960
Let me tell you an interesting. Oh, go ahead, Jamie.

48:23.200 --> 48:25.840
I was just going to say, though, like if they completely crash

48:25.840 --> 48:29.560
and go out of business and wait for like another five years

48:29.560 --> 48:32.480
and people will be like, oh, fun goes and then you'll find them

48:32.480 --> 48:35.040
for like super expensive. Mm hmm.

48:35.040 --> 48:37.440
Let me tell an interesting aside story from the cruise.

48:37.440 --> 48:40.040
I promise it's relevant. It is absolutely relevant.

48:40.040 --> 48:43.640
So as part of the cruise, not only was it a Star Trek cruise,

48:43.640 --> 48:45.240
but cruises go to cities, right?

48:45.240 --> 48:48.320
So we we docked in three different ports,

48:48.320 --> 48:50.920
Cabo San Lucas, Mazatlan and Puerto Vallarta.

48:51.160 --> 48:53.600
I've never been to Puerto Vallarta and I was very excited to go.

48:53.600 --> 48:54.600
And I had a great time.

48:54.600 --> 48:57.040
But one of the things I thought we had more hours in Puerto Vallarta

48:57.040 --> 48:58.080
than anywhere else.

48:58.080 --> 49:01.600
And the boat docked across the street from a mall.

49:02.000 --> 49:04.920
And I was just kind of curious, like, oh, I wonder what the malls in Mexico

49:04.920 --> 49:07.520
are like, I wonder what kind of stuff I can find there

49:07.520 --> 49:09.880
and, you know, things that maybe I can't find back home and so forth.

49:10.200 --> 49:13.040
So we went into the mall in Puerto Vallarta

49:13.360 --> 49:16.440
and I saw a store called Game Planet.

49:16.960 --> 49:19.560
And I my my brain actually kind of thought of this show

49:19.560 --> 49:22.360
because we've had a listener from Mexico for a long time.

49:22.360 --> 49:25.680
This will see the show, Mike Deft, Holla, I know you're listening out there.

49:25.920 --> 49:30.240
And Mike Deft has always really kind of enlightened us a bit to how gaming

49:30.240 --> 49:33.000
purchases kind of work in another country,

49:33.640 --> 49:37.680
where maybe some game companies have not always had an official presence.

49:37.960 --> 49:40.280
And that was always very fascinating to me.

49:40.600 --> 49:44.760
Now, keep in mind, Mexico, big country, just like the U.S., right?

49:45.800 --> 49:48.120
Mike Deft lives in like Oregon.

49:48.120 --> 49:51.120
And the place in Mexico I was at was like Oklahoma.

49:51.120 --> 49:52.560
OK, there were very different parts.

49:52.560 --> 49:54.360
Puerto Vallarta is a very different part of the country.

49:54.680 --> 49:58.680
However, there was a store I went into in the mall called Game Planet.

49:58.960 --> 50:01.600
And when I went into the mall or went to the store,

50:01.640 --> 50:04.600
my first reaction was this is this is just a GameStop.

50:04.760 --> 50:07.800
This is like but it's way more Nintendo stuff.

50:07.800 --> 50:10.160
I noticed because I was like, oh, Nintendo probably has a presence.

50:10.520 --> 50:13.800
But then the other the back half of the wall and I'm going to show this.

50:13.800 --> 50:15.840
I'm sorry to the podcast listeners.

50:15.840 --> 50:18.080
Let me actually switch the shot here so you can see this.

50:18.440 --> 50:20.880
Notice how the back wall where I'm standing,

50:21.120 --> 50:24.560
it's all fun goes just like any GameStop.

50:24.800 --> 50:26.960
I think I took that picture and sent it to our Discord.

50:27.160 --> 50:30.760
And then, of course, like game cards for like PlayStation Network

50:30.760 --> 50:31.680
and some other things.

50:31.680 --> 50:34.360
Otherwise, the signage was all in Spanish and all that.

50:34.360 --> 50:37.720
But it was pretty much like any GameStop I've ever been into otherwise.

50:38.000 --> 50:40.880
But it was interesting because I kind of thought about Mike Deft

50:41.120 --> 50:42.560
when I when I went in there.

50:42.560 --> 50:46.000
So as to how Matt says, I was blown away

50:46.040 --> 50:48.440
that Sears is alive and thriving while in Mexico.

50:48.680 --> 50:51.240
I didn't go to a Sears, but I did go to a different store.

50:51.240 --> 50:52.720
And I already forget the name of it.

50:52.720 --> 50:56.440
But it was it was neat because it was like it was like a Sears,

50:56.840 --> 51:00.240
but had like a travel department in it and a flower store

51:00.240 --> 51:04.280
because flowers are huge in the culture in Mexico.

51:04.800 --> 51:07.920
The we actually went on a tour in Mazatlan and they were saying that the flower

51:07.920 --> 51:11.320
shop was open 24 hours because for every occasion there's

51:11.360 --> 51:12.840
and the flowers are beautiful, too.

51:12.840 --> 51:15.640
Like it's not just, you know, any old flowers.

51:15.640 --> 51:18.120
They were really very beautiful arrangements.

51:18.120 --> 51:19.400
Liverpool says Mike Deft.

51:19.400 --> 51:20.960
Thank you. That's it. That's it.

51:20.960 --> 51:23.120
So anyway, quick aside from the cruise.

51:23.120 --> 51:27.960
But my point being funko pops taking over the store.

51:28.160 --> 51:30.680
Not a unique problem to the US.

51:34.680 --> 51:37.560
Very much the case in Mexico as well, from what I observed,

51:37.560 --> 51:40.800
and I'm sure Canada probably over overseas as well.

51:40.800 --> 51:43.600
I don't know if there's like, you know, big import fees overseas and stuff,

51:43.600 --> 51:46.960
but probably a very similar story as well. So.

51:47.720 --> 51:50.800
But I think the bubble is finally burst on these funko pops.

51:51.160 --> 51:54.040
And honestly, I hate to say it, maybe it's for the best.

51:54.320 --> 51:56.920
Maybe it does cause funko to scale back a bit.

51:56.920 --> 52:00.040
And now we it's not like I don't own any funko pop dolls. I do.

52:00.040 --> 52:02.640
I'm looking right at some Mass Effect Andromeda dolls that I have.

52:03.280 --> 52:06.680
And I have some for Drag Race, you know, some other things as well that we enjoy.

52:08.240 --> 52:11.800
I think maybe they'll have to scale back a little bit and maybe more intentionally

52:11.800 --> 52:14.320
pick some of the partnerships and some of the like, you know,

52:14.320 --> 52:18.240
I didn't like how it's all exclusive at this store and that store

52:18.240 --> 52:20.360
and like all of this stuff. So.

52:21.400 --> 52:25.080
Anyway, that's that's the only way we can get them to carry those things.

52:25.080 --> 52:30.040
And also, I mean, I think a lot of it is people, some some people buy these

52:30.120 --> 52:33.200
because we're just the world we live in nowadays thinking that there's

52:33.200 --> 52:36.720
a speculative market for it as well and that they're going to be worth something.

52:36.720 --> 52:39.120
And I don't know that they are.

52:39.120 --> 52:41.640
I don't think most of them are worth anything.

52:41.800 --> 52:46.560
It's just do you want to keep it or do you want to like not keep?

52:46.560 --> 52:48.840
I don't know. They don't do anything either.

52:48.840 --> 52:50.840
So it's like, I don't know.

52:50.840 --> 52:54.040
The same thing could be said about collecting action figures

52:54.040 --> 52:58.280
or collecting, you know, statues, anime statues.

52:58.280 --> 53:03.280
It's all, you know, I I get sick of people who are like,

53:03.280 --> 53:05.360
oh, you do funko's meh.

53:05.360 --> 53:07.360
I'm like, I don't care. You don't live my life.

53:07.360 --> 53:09.440
Yeah. People can like what they like.

53:10.200 --> 53:13.840
Yeah. But, you know, it's like for all the people who are like going,

53:13.840 --> 53:15.520
hey, look at that, look at that.

53:15.520 --> 53:17.520
I mean, there's people who are going to be really disappointed.

53:17.520 --> 53:19.760
I wanted those those. Yeah.

53:21.200 --> 53:23.040
Dead by daylight ones.

53:23.040 --> 53:24.800
And now I don't get them.

53:24.800 --> 53:26.800
You know, I'm really disappointed over it.

53:27.800 --> 53:30.200
I just I'm just like.

53:30.200 --> 53:34.120
People need to let people like their stuff, but we also need to make sure

53:34.120 --> 53:38.120
that we're holding, you know, companies accountable for their poor

53:38.120 --> 53:39.840
financial decisions. Right.

53:39.840 --> 53:41.680
You know, they tried to do everything.

53:41.680 --> 53:45.320
They tried to put out something for every fandom. Yeah.

53:45.320 --> 53:50.520
And do you know how many fandoms and just different shit people are into?

53:51.280 --> 53:54.240
It's a lot. You cannot. You cannot. Absolutely.

53:54.240 --> 53:56.880
They way overstepped.

53:56.880 --> 53:58.200
Let's see. Yeah. Tiger College

53:58.200 --> 54:00.720
has a couple of years from now, someone will do a documentary

54:00.720 --> 54:03.880
on digging those funko pops at the landfill and then somebody else

54:04.080 --> 54:05.440
just like the cartridges.

54:05.440 --> 54:07.520
They will sell them and you can buy them this.

54:07.520 --> 54:09.040
I was once in a landfill.

54:09.040 --> 54:12.040
You're literally going to be able to put trash on your wall

54:12.040 --> 54:13.000
and people will do it.

54:13.000 --> 54:16.160
And it's just the interesting way our society works.

54:16.640 --> 54:20.440
S2100 Matt asking another question about my trip to Mexico, saying,

54:20.640 --> 54:25.200
did you see the roaming random cars driving around like in Forza Horizon five?

54:25.720 --> 54:31.480
No, but I did notice the absolute lack of traffic laws period.

54:32.560 --> 54:35.600
Or like very, very few traffic lights.

54:35.600 --> 54:39.400
I will say when we were in Mazatlán, our tour guide, she knew

54:39.440 --> 54:43.760
she would jump out into the street and hold her arms up to stop the traffic.

54:44.000 --> 54:45.400
So all of us, you know,

54:45.400 --> 54:48.480
stupid Americans and Canadians could walk by and cross the street

54:48.480 --> 54:51.480
because, you know, people don't stop unless you,

54:51.480 --> 54:54.280
you know, make it very clear to do those sorts of things.

54:54.280 --> 54:56.880
This is this wasn't like some obscure part of town.

54:56.920 --> 54:59.720
This is like downtown Mazatlán, the old town district.

54:59.720 --> 55:03.000
So I was that I definitely noticed that

55:03.040 --> 55:06.320
the absolute lack of any traffic laws whatsoever.

55:06.960 --> 55:08.440
But you know what?

55:09.120 --> 55:11.040
I got from point A to point B.

55:11.040 --> 55:14.760
We got from our boat down to Zona Romantica, which was like a three

55:15.680 --> 55:17.240
three mile journey.

55:17.240 --> 55:20.280
It was too long to walk, but not a very long bus.

55:20.800 --> 55:25.440
I actually took thanks to JD, who is huge on public transit, our buddy JD.

55:26.960 --> 55:29.640
I I rode a Mexican bus.

55:29.640 --> 55:32.880
I paid 10 pesos to ride the Mexican, but actually JD paid for me

55:32.880 --> 55:38.080
10 pesos to ride the Mexican bus from the port down to Zona Romantica.

55:38.320 --> 55:39.800
And it was great.

55:39.800 --> 55:42.480
But anyway, I'll talk more about that on Thursday.

55:42.480 --> 55:46.680
All right. Let's get into this next story.

55:46.720 --> 55:50.840
Oh, you know, when you saw this in the news, you knew I was going to bring this up.

55:50.840 --> 55:53.880
You knew I was going to bring up this story.

55:54.360 --> 55:57.280
Am I here to gloat tonight?

55:57.280 --> 55:59.200
A little. Maybe. OK.

55:59.200 --> 56:01.080
Yes, but yes, but

56:01.960 --> 56:05.240
I actually don't think there's a lot here to gloat about.

56:05.720 --> 56:07.480
So what am I talking about?

56:07.480 --> 56:12.520
Anybody that listened to our predictions episode in early January probably heard.

56:12.520 --> 56:15.040
And I wish I had time to go find the clip and dig it up.

56:15.040 --> 56:15.960
But you know what?

56:15.960 --> 56:18.440
The podcast is out there. You can go listen to it for yourself.

56:18.440 --> 56:19.480
It's on the record.

56:19.480 --> 56:22.200
One of the predictions I made, I think it was my number three prediction.

56:22.200 --> 56:26.120
I said the current CEO of Square Enix,

56:26.120 --> 56:30.200
Yosuke Matsuda was Square Enix was going to get sacked.

56:30.440 --> 56:35.000
And I said he was going to do it because the fact that he tied himself to NFTs,

56:35.320 --> 56:40.200
the fact that he failed to redirect the PR conversation

56:40.200 --> 56:44.160
around the Final Fantasy 16 diversity issue and people raise it,

56:44.160 --> 56:47.120
you know, they're very, you know, what was a poor response to all of that

56:47.400 --> 56:50.520
and not, you know, doing better on clarifying

56:50.520 --> 56:52.880
and showing how they're going to do better in that whole situation.

56:53.120 --> 56:58.040
And then, of course, you know, add into that things like the fact that Babylon's fall

56:58.080 --> 56:59.720
absolutely flopped.

56:59.720 --> 57:02.320
There is no nice way to put it.

57:02.320 --> 57:06.240
I don't think four spoken is unfortunately selling to expectations,

57:06.480 --> 57:09.200
especially when this same guy has gone on the record

57:09.200 --> 57:12.720
saying things like Tomb Raider did not sell the expectations.

57:12.720 --> 57:14.840
Well, if Tomb Raider didn't sell the expectations,

57:14.840 --> 57:17.760
I'm positive for spoken and sell the expectations either.

57:18.080 --> 57:21.200
So what happened? Where does this all end up? Yep.

57:21.840 --> 57:26.920
You know, Suki Matsuda was officially sacked by Square Enix this week.

57:27.160 --> 57:29.720
The company has announced this shake up on Friday,

57:29.920 --> 57:33.560
saying it is needed to chase more technological innovation.

57:33.800 --> 57:37.800
Now, here's where I'm willing to admit this is not the part of the news

57:37.800 --> 57:42.080
I saw coming, because unfortunately, although, yes, I thank you,

57:42.080 --> 57:46.280
Jaskren, who says I saw the news and I thought that Rob might be a prophet.

57:46.560 --> 57:50.480
OK, so maybe I did call this, but the reasoning here,

57:50.960 --> 57:54.280
not what I thought I would see, and that's not a good thing.

57:54.680 --> 58:01.360
So the replacement for Matsuda is a gentleman named Takashi Kiryu,

58:01.680 --> 58:04.360
who is a new CEO. He's only been at Square for a few years.

58:04.640 --> 58:09.080
But prior to that, he worked for the Dentsu Innovation Initiative.

58:09.400 --> 58:13.880
This is a business group that explores opportunities in things like the metaverse.

58:16.040 --> 58:19.080
Here's the official on the record reason that Square Enix gave

58:19.080 --> 58:21.200
for why this transition is happening.

58:21.520 --> 58:24.960
Keep in mind, Matsuda was there for 10 years.

58:25.160 --> 58:28.560
That is that is a long tenureship.

58:29.880 --> 58:32.720
Under the rapid change of business environments surrounding

58:32.720 --> 58:34.160
the entertainment industry,

58:34.160 --> 58:37.560
the proposed change is intended to reshape the management team

58:37.720 --> 58:41.920
with the goal of adopting ever evolving technological innovations

58:42.120 --> 58:45.320
and maximizing on the creativity of the company's group

58:45.320 --> 58:49.640
in order to deliver even greater entertainment to customers around the world.

58:50.640 --> 58:53.160
Ever evolving technological innovations.

58:54.120 --> 58:56.720
That worries me because they're not talking about PS6.

58:57.320 --> 58:58.760
They're not talking about VR.

59:00.040 --> 59:06.120
They're talking about NFTs and what I think the new buzzword in everybody's ear.

59:06.120 --> 59:09.000
This is where I really think it's going, AI.

59:11.080 --> 59:13.120
How that gets worked into video games,

59:13.120 --> 59:14.920
I'm not sure what that looks like yet.

59:14.920 --> 59:16.440
AI is already in video games, though.

59:17.360 --> 59:19.640
Oh, very good point.

59:19.640 --> 59:20.720
Yes, AI. You're right.

59:20.720 --> 59:24.840
AI, the concept of AI has been in video games since video games existed, really.

59:24.840 --> 59:29.360
Machine learning in and of itself is common now.

59:29.360 --> 59:29.640
Yeah.

59:29.640 --> 59:31.400
Especially in a lot of technology.

59:31.880 --> 59:33.760
So I...

59:34.360 --> 59:35.080
Totally fair.

59:35.080 --> 59:39.360
I chose my words poorly because what I mean to say is AI in regards

59:39.360 --> 59:44.840
to some of this newer trend about automated art, automated writing,

59:45.080 --> 59:50.000
and could there be a game that ends up being a forever game

59:50.400 --> 59:54.480
that is able to be forever because AI generates a chunk of it?

59:54.840 --> 59:57.240
I have a feeling this is what Square Enix wants to get on.

59:57.520 --> 59:58.880
They want to make an open world game

59:58.880 --> 01:00:02.240
that is in part generated by AI, for better or for worse.

01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:04.440
Sounds interesting.

01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:05.440
It could be interesting.

01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:08.080
I don't know. I have to see it.

01:00:08.680 --> 01:00:10.960
I can see potential in that kind of idea.

01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:13.640
Like, imagine that you start off with like a base world

01:00:14.120 --> 01:00:19.480
and as the people, quote, exist in it and play through it like like an MMO,

01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:23.160
the landscape changes, like say that you buy

01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:26.320
a plot of land and you do construction on it.

01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:32.000
That plot of lands, you know, the the ground moves to other places.

01:00:32.240 --> 01:00:33.880
You know, it damages a river.

01:00:33.880 --> 01:00:38.080
So, you know, that having something like that would actually be really awesome.

01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:41.440
I worry that's not where Square is going with it.

01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:42.960
We'll see. Time will tell.

01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:45.200
And I'm willing to give this guy a chance.

01:00:45.400 --> 01:00:49.080
And I'm not going to judge this guy completely on his background,

01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:51.800
because what he did in the past is not what he's going to do now.

01:00:51.800 --> 01:00:56.520
So I'm willing to give this guy a fresh slate and see where does he take this now?

01:00:56.800 --> 01:00:59.280
I'm not encouraged by what I'm hearing, but let's see.

01:00:59.680 --> 01:01:00.960
Because you're right, DarkSocker.

01:01:00.960 --> 01:01:02.760
You don't run Square Enix. Neither do I.

01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:04.560
Here's where I see the problem.

01:01:04.560 --> 01:01:09.800
OK, the problem, and I think this is why Matsuda ultimately paid the price.

01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:12.800
The problem was these very high profile,

01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:16.760
big bunch budget launches that are flopping.

01:01:17.360 --> 01:01:19.000
And there's no nice way to say it.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.960
That's that's not a testament to the quality of the game.

01:01:21.960 --> 01:01:25.680
Well, I think it is in Babylon's fall case, but I haven't played Forspoken.

01:01:25.920 --> 01:01:30.600
I'm not I'm not able to speak to why that game flopped, but I have a hunch

01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:32.720
it's because the demo they put out wasn't great.

01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:36.080
And when you're asking people to invest 70 dollars in a game,

01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:39.720
you need to have a rock solid demo or no demo at all, quite frankly.

01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:44.080
I thought that game looked awesome and everything that I had seen,

01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:47.160
I just didn't buy it because I have no way to play it right now. Right.

01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:50.800
And I want to I want to also show something else, because I believe

01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:55.560
where Square Enix needs to be going is some of these more middle of the road.

01:01:55.560 --> 01:01:59.280
I do think Square Enix needs to do some investment in the middle of the road

01:01:59.480 --> 01:02:04.080
and some lower budget titles that can actually bring forth

01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:07.400
a little more than maybe a big budget AI or NFT project.

01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:11.280
Here's some of the proof I want to kind of to make my case, you know,

01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:13.720
and maybe you're going to read into this differently than I do.

01:02:13.880 --> 01:02:16.360
But here's me attempting to show some receipts. OK.

01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:18.320
Now, I'm not able to find the U.S.

01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:21.000
sales numbers yet for how some games are performing.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:26.280
However, Forspoken in Japan was last in the top 30

01:02:26.440 --> 01:02:30.480
the week of I believe this was February 6th through February 12th.

01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:33.480
And you can see when it was last in the top 30,

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:39.880
it moved 1932 units for a total of 35,000 units.

01:02:40.160 --> 01:02:42.320
Now, granted, this is retail units.

01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:44.120
This doesn't count what's digital.

01:02:44.120 --> 01:02:47.080
So I'm not saying this game only moved 35,000 copies.

01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:51.280
But, you know, just to kind of set the benchmark there, this high dollar

01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:57.200
big budget game looks like it's going to cap out maybe at 40,000 copies in Japan,

01:02:57.440 --> 01:03:02.200
unless maybe there's some bang up DLC that happens later or something like that

01:03:02.440 --> 01:03:06.240
that, you know, causes this game to sell more. In contrast,

01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:13.200
the Square Enix game that I am unable to shut up about, Theatrhythm, shows up.

01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:15.280
Now, we don't have complete sales data for Theatrhythm,

01:03:15.400 --> 01:03:18.040
but it shows up on the next week's sales list. Right.

01:03:18.320 --> 01:03:21.920
And so we have two entries for Theatrhythm because it's on two platforms.

01:03:22.240 --> 01:03:26.160
The Switch copy has moved 11,000 units in, excuse me,

01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:28.560
11.5 thousand units in its first week.

01:03:28.920 --> 01:03:32.400
And the PlayStation 4 versions down here at number 16,

01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:36.760
which moved 3.6 thousand units in its first week.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:40.520
You add that together, that's about 15,000

01:03:40.920 --> 01:03:43.920
in the first week that this game has moved.

01:03:44.240 --> 01:03:47.760
Now, granted, that's not that's not even half of 40,000,

01:03:48.040 --> 01:03:51.240
but we're not quite sure yet what the subsequent weeks are going to look like.

01:03:51.240 --> 01:03:55.200
And even if this game only capped out at maybe 30,000 units,

01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:59.720
and I would also argue Theatrhythm is certainly going to sell even more

01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:02.760
digitally because of things like the Digital Deluxe Edition

01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:04.760
and some of those things that they've been offering digitally.

01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:08.640
I would bet dimes to dollars, even if I don't have the receipts to prove it.

01:04:08.840 --> 01:04:11.520
Theatrhythm is going to sell more digitally

01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:15.840
than it's going to in a physical copy than a game like Forespoken.

01:04:16.640 --> 01:04:22.000
My point being, even if Theatrhythm and Forespoken sell the same amount,

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:26.880
which my receipts only maybe show that that's the way things are going to go right now.

01:04:27.320 --> 01:04:31.640
One of those games took a hell of a lot more money to make than the other.

01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:36.280
Now, I know some of you are going to poke holes in my theory left and right.

01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:38.200
Rob, you're only considering Japan.

01:04:38.400 --> 01:04:39.760
Rob, it's only physical.

01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:42.480
And, you know, there's these I understand I'm willing to accept

01:04:42.480 --> 01:04:44.720
that this is not a perfect science what I'm showing you.

01:04:45.240 --> 01:04:49.560
What I'm trying to point out is that a game like Theatrhythm

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:54.000
that cost a fraction to make of something like Forespoken,

01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:57.440
this is where Square Enix needs to head a lot more of.

01:04:57.720 --> 01:05:01.080
They need to maybe play it safe for a little bit

01:05:01.320 --> 01:05:04.600
and maybe give us that Chrono Trigger remaster

01:05:04.600 --> 01:05:06.680
that Jason was referencing in the intro tonight

01:05:06.920 --> 01:05:10.520
and some of these other things that can move a fair amount of units

01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:14.920
to then build up the coffers to try again on one of these AAA titles

01:05:14.920 --> 01:05:18.560
that maybe, you know, a big name can get behind or something like that.

01:05:18.560 --> 01:05:23.600
You know, if Final Fantasy 16 does very well, it's too early to say.

01:05:23.600 --> 01:05:27.000
And I'm not going to venture a guess on how well Final Fantasy 16 is going to sell.

01:05:27.360 --> 01:05:33.240
But if Final Fantasy 16 does well, let's say it does better than 15 or 13,

01:05:33.640 --> 01:05:35.640
which it might, it might.

01:05:37.120 --> 01:05:40.000
Despite however you feel about the controversies on this whole thing,

01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:42.280
I think you could recognize there's a real possibility

01:05:42.280 --> 01:05:47.160
16 could sell better than 15 or 13 did, or 12, quite honestly.

01:05:47.320 --> 01:05:49.320
Hell, we'd have to go all the way back to 10.

01:05:49.320 --> 01:05:52.720
I think 16 is going to sell better than any game since 10. I do.

01:05:53.600 --> 01:05:58.480
If that, well, minus the MMOs, don't include 14, because that's not fair.

01:05:58.680 --> 01:06:03.240
Because the monthly fee, that's filling Square's bank account right now

01:06:03.240 --> 01:06:05.120
is 14, to some extent 11.

01:06:05.120 --> 01:06:06.480
So we're not going to count those.

01:06:08.160 --> 01:06:11.520
But as far as 16 goes, if 16 does well,

01:06:11.920 --> 01:06:19.920
I would bet Naoki Yoshida, Yoshi-P, gets licensed to make whatever game he wants.

01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:23.480
And honestly, he should.

01:06:24.840 --> 01:06:29.680
Hopefully he will listen to some of the feedback on the types of characters he should be putting in those games.

01:06:30.040 --> 01:06:32.160
But I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna go too far down.

01:06:32.160 --> 01:06:35.240
I mean, 14 has done a pretty good job.

01:06:35.280 --> 01:06:40.960
So there's, you know, and I got into this when we talked about the controversy to begin with

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:44.160
is that I think there's a lot more play than just Yoshida.

01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:49.320
I think it's the voices that have educated Yoshida in the past need to be corrected.

01:06:49.760 --> 01:06:50.960
But I'm gonna, I'm gonna digress.

01:06:51.080 --> 01:06:55.080
I think Yoshida is going to get creative license to do whatever he wants next.

01:06:55.080 --> 01:06:58.960
And that will be the new AAA offering that comes out of Square Enix.

01:06:59.240 --> 01:07:00.480
So we'll, we'll see.

01:07:02.760 --> 01:07:06.360
Jaskren in chat says, this is a really good analysis.

01:07:06.400 --> 01:07:10.200
There is more money to be made with smaller budget games if those games are hits.

01:07:10.520 --> 01:07:14.040
It is very similar to the movie industry.

01:07:14.960 --> 01:07:19.280
The movie industry wants movies like The Blair Witch Project.

01:07:19.680 --> 01:07:21.320
There's something about Mary.

01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:25.320
Hell, everything everywhere all at once would fall into this category.

01:07:25.480 --> 01:07:27.400
What do all of these movies have in common?

01:07:28.360 --> 01:07:30.760
Small or paranormal activity.

01:07:30.760 --> 01:07:31.520
Another great example.

01:07:31.680 --> 01:07:36.240
Small, very small, in some case, budget movies that make a lot of money.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:38.520
They want those type of movies.

01:07:38.520 --> 01:07:39.080
Snakes on the plane.

01:07:39.240 --> 01:07:41.000
Yep, snakes on the plane, great example.

01:07:41.280 --> 01:07:46.120
Honestly, Megan and Cocaine Bear, you want to go, at least I'm assuming Cocaine Bear made money.

01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:48.280
Sure sounded like it was going to.

01:07:49.160 --> 01:07:58.080
The studios want those movies, as opposed to Oh, God, what was that absolute Disney flop that came out, like, last year?

01:07:58.320 --> 01:08:00.840
It was a couple of years ago, maybe it was before the pandemic even.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:06.520
And it just flopped so hard in theaters that like, yeah, it was it was, it was really ugly.

01:08:06.960 --> 01:08:08.480
The movie industry wants those things.

01:08:08.520 --> 01:08:10.280
John Carter was that maybe?

01:08:10.560 --> 01:08:13.240
No, I feel like it was a superhero movie of some sort.

01:08:13.760 --> 01:08:15.200
Maybe based on mythology.

01:08:15.280 --> 01:08:16.000
I don't remember.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:16.760
I'm sorry, y'all.

01:08:16.840 --> 01:08:20.200
Oh, you're thinking of Percy Jackson?

01:08:21.560 --> 01:08:23.360
No, but that is a good example.

01:08:24.520 --> 01:08:25.800
No, no, I know what you're thinking of.

01:08:25.800 --> 01:08:30.360
You're thinking of Oh, God, it costs him a lot of money.

01:08:31.360 --> 01:08:32.240
My kids have the books.

01:08:32.280 --> 01:08:33.640
Yes, it was books.

01:08:33.640 --> 01:08:39.400
Oh, no, it's not John Carter.

01:08:39.400 --> 01:08:40.360
It's not John Carter.

01:08:40.400 --> 01:08:42.400
It's more recent that John Carter's like years ago.

01:08:42.720 --> 01:08:46.520
I was like, I was back when I was in the No, not Buzz Lightyear.

01:08:46.560 --> 01:08:47.120
I'll look it up.

01:08:47.120 --> 01:08:47.560
Hold on.

01:08:47.560 --> 01:08:48.360
I don't remember.

01:08:48.360 --> 01:08:49.120
It's called now.

01:08:49.160 --> 01:08:51.560
It's John Carter.

01:08:51.600 --> 01:08:53.480
They're they're all saying it was John Carter of Mars.

01:08:53.520 --> 01:08:54.720
So maybe maybe it wasn't.

01:08:54.880 --> 01:08:56.160
That was a flop, too.

01:08:56.160 --> 01:08:59.760
But there was another word because I don't even know what it is.

01:09:00.120 --> 01:09:03.120
But I thought I thought it was like a mythological story or something.

01:09:03.440 --> 01:09:05.280
No, it's it's not John Carter.

01:09:05.280 --> 01:09:08.760
I know for a fact it's not it's my kids have the books.

01:09:08.800 --> 01:09:09.560
It's not.

01:09:10.200 --> 01:09:12.320
It came out like during the pandemic.

01:09:13.400 --> 01:09:16.880
I just don't remember it was called it was Artemis Fowl.

01:09:16.920 --> 01:09:17.720
That's what it was.

01:09:17.760 --> 01:09:20.640
Oh, that Artemis Fowl was awful.

01:09:20.680 --> 01:09:21.920
It was foul.

01:09:22.240 --> 01:09:22.720
Yeah.

01:09:23.120 --> 01:09:26.360
Anyway, I all these.

01:09:26.400 --> 01:09:29.680
OK, I mean, yes, we're all guessing get in Rob's brain.

01:09:29.680 --> 01:09:31.080
What's the movie he's thinking of?

01:09:31.160 --> 01:09:34.640
Everything you guys are shouting in chat is actually making my point.

01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:36.680
So thank you for the new mutants.

01:09:36.680 --> 01:09:38.080
I don't think that was that good either.

01:09:38.080 --> 01:09:40.640
And that was like the X-Men.

01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:43.160
And I don't know how well Mulan did the live action one,

01:09:43.160 --> 01:09:45.160
but I don't think as good as Lion King.

01:09:45.160 --> 01:09:50.000
But I think Square Enix would be very smart to stick to the Octopath Travelers,

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:53.880
the Bravely defaults, the hell, the Dungeon Explorer.

01:09:53.880 --> 01:09:57.920
Even if I think that game has some big flaws with it, that game doesn't

01:09:58.160 --> 01:10:03.960
doesn't get a CEO fired when it doesn't do well, as opposed to a Babylon's fall.

01:10:04.160 --> 01:10:08.640
I think Square Enix needs to take some safer risks so they can find out what

01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:11.680
their audience really wants so they can make the big one.

01:10:11.880 --> 01:10:16.800
I worry when they talk like this, tomorrow's technologies, whether it's NFT,

01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:21.200
whether it's AI or whatever, they're going to try to tell us the next big thing

01:10:21.200 --> 01:10:25.840
and not listen to what the audience is telling you with their wallets.

01:10:26.280 --> 01:10:26.880
And guess what?

01:10:26.920 --> 01:10:29.480
I would bet, I would bet money.

01:10:30.120 --> 01:10:33.400
They did not expect Theatrhythm to even move

01:10:33.400 --> 01:10:35.840
what the number of units that I just talked about.

01:10:37.440 --> 01:10:39.880
Nostalgia is a wild thing.

01:10:40.200 --> 01:10:43.560
And I get I'm not saying I want Square Enix to only

01:10:44.560 --> 01:10:47.960
do the nostalgia jerk for years and years.

01:10:47.960 --> 01:10:52.480
I do want Square Enix to be able to create things like Fourspoken

01:10:52.800 --> 01:10:55.120
and create new types of things.

01:10:55.280 --> 01:10:57.160
They just need to be able to do it

01:10:58.520 --> 01:10:59.520
on a smaller budget

01:11:00.760 --> 01:11:01.600
for a little while.

01:11:03.040 --> 01:11:06.120
And honestly, offloading some of the companies

01:11:06.120 --> 01:11:09.120
that they did may actually help them to that.

01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:13.560
Prince Caspian, that was no that because that was a Narnia movie.

01:11:13.560 --> 01:11:15.800
No, no, no. Anyway, forget it.

01:11:16.560 --> 01:11:17.960
That was like super old too.

01:11:17.960 --> 01:11:19.840
I'm I'm done trying to figure it out.

01:11:19.840 --> 01:11:21.880
Maybe I'll Google it while Loki does the next story.

01:11:21.880 --> 01:11:22.920
It was Artemis Fowl.

01:11:22.960 --> 01:11:24.880
I can tell you right now because it was awful.

01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:27.920
And I don't even remember if that came out in theaters.

01:11:27.920 --> 01:11:31.760
But like, yeah, they've had a lot of flops with as far as big budget.

01:11:31.760 --> 01:11:33.480
Yeah. John Carpenter and Mars.

01:11:33.480 --> 01:11:36.960
They were expecting it to be like a big new trilogy like Star Wars size.

01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:38.480
And it probably was. I don't know.

01:11:38.480 --> 01:11:40.560
Anyway, that was like years ago.

01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:42.560
I'm officially done thinking about it. All right.

01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:45.240
What was it going to say?

01:11:45.240 --> 01:11:47.200
Oh, Fifth Dream has a great comment here.

01:11:47.200 --> 01:11:51.360
And those games have engines to build, so they'll be cheaper to produce.

01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:54.440
Also, that one card game where they put out like for a year,

01:11:54.440 --> 01:11:57.840
just insert a new story and swap assets, new 40 dollar game.

01:11:58.760 --> 01:12:00.920
Are you talking about like Kingdom Hearts, Chains of Memories

01:12:00.920 --> 01:12:01.920
and those types of car games?

01:12:01.920 --> 01:12:04.480
But when you talk about the engine, you're absolutely right.

01:12:04.680 --> 01:12:10.920
Look at Octopath, Octopath 2, Live Alive, you know, and where

01:12:10.920 --> 01:12:15.120
I honestly think the Chrono Trigger remake ought to go is in that engine.

01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:16.800
And if you want to talk about remakes,

01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:19.400
you know, Secret of Mana was in a similar engine,

01:12:19.400 --> 01:12:20.920
although that wouldn't do us well.

01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:24.000
But, you know, we have Final Fantasy six remake in that engine.

01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:26.920
Well, now we have the pixel remasters and so forth.

01:12:26.920 --> 01:12:29.120
So I want it this way.

01:12:30.160 --> 01:12:35.280
Yeah. So anyway, my my point is Square Enix should really listen

01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:39.440
to what the fans want and need a CEO that comes in there to really listen to this

01:12:39.920 --> 01:12:43.320
and maybe lay off some of the experimentation for a little bit

01:12:43.640 --> 01:12:46.840
while they find their footing again to help them find their next game.

01:12:46.840 --> 01:12:48.600
That's what I would do if I was CEO.

01:12:49.640 --> 01:12:52.880
But I'm not. But also I call this.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.320
All right. All right.

01:12:55.640 --> 01:12:58.000
My ego is swelling. All right.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:12:59.360
Anyway, let's move on.

01:12:59.360 --> 01:13:00.920
On that note, Dark Soccer.

01:13:00.920 --> 01:13:04.760
Well, if you ruled the world, we'd be getting this a lot sooner.

01:13:05.880 --> 01:13:08.040
Right? Mm hmm.

01:13:08.040 --> 01:13:10.480
We would have already been done had it.

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:16.920
So there is a Dead by Daylight movie coming out.

01:13:17.920 --> 01:13:21.080
I'm I'm both afraid and excited.

01:13:22.040 --> 01:13:26.440
So it's coming out from Blumhouse and Atomic Monster

01:13:26.440 --> 01:13:29.200
and of course, Behavior, because Behavior owns Dead by Daylight.

01:13:30.320 --> 01:13:35.840
But they are doing a feature film adaptation of Dead by Daylight.

01:13:38.200 --> 01:13:42.200
And they're they sound pretty excited about it.

01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:49.640
There is the for the Atomic Monster founder and CEO, James Wan said,

01:13:50.080 --> 01:13:51.320
I'm going to read the quote.

01:13:51.320 --> 01:13:54.080
In Dead by Daylight, the Behavior team has created a love letter

01:13:54.080 --> 01:13:57.200
to the world of horror, building an incredible environment,

01:13:57.200 --> 01:13:59.640
teeming with atmosphere and terrifying villains,

01:13:59.640 --> 01:14:02.000
perfect for a scary cinematic adaptation.

01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:04.360
We're big fans of the game at Atomic Monster,

01:14:04.360 --> 01:14:06.160
and we're thrilled to be teaming up with Blumhouse

01:14:06.160 --> 01:14:09.320
to bring this frightening, visceral world to the big screen.

01:14:09.720 --> 01:14:12.720
So they're looking for a director and screenwriter.

01:14:14.160 --> 01:14:18.080
They want to bring on somebody that appreciates

01:14:18.080 --> 01:14:20.240
and loves the game like the fans do.

01:14:21.480 --> 01:14:24.920
You know, lots of, I guess, watching of the lore.

01:14:26.600 --> 01:14:32.120
And also just FYI, one directed The Conjuring and Insidious

01:14:32.120 --> 01:14:35.440
and Blum produced Get Out and The Purge.

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:40.240
So, I mean, there's some really good like credentials behind it.

01:14:40.240 --> 01:14:41.280
They did Megan too.

01:14:41.280 --> 01:14:44.520
So Blumhouse is a huge name in the horror world right now.

01:14:44.520 --> 01:14:47.680
So this is this is a good place for this to be at the end of the day.

01:14:48.880 --> 01:14:53.280
I mean, and I have a feeling that they may not be able to get

01:14:53.280 --> 01:14:57.280
like the licensed killers, you know, not without lots of money.

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:02.960
But I have seen see it like with some of like.

01:15:02.960 --> 01:15:06.080
The original four survivors have to be there.

01:15:06.080 --> 01:15:06.560
Yeah.

01:15:07.200 --> 01:15:12.480
And I'm thinking that maybe like, you know, the original three

01:15:12.480 --> 01:15:19.440
and Nurse and you know, like Hag, you know, like the the in game ones.

01:15:19.440 --> 01:15:20.760
I mean, those would be a definite.

01:15:20.760 --> 01:15:22.880
I mean, I would love.

01:15:22.880 --> 01:15:25.320
The Hag would be scary because she's a cannibal.

01:15:26.320 --> 01:15:29.360
But you know, they're going to set up sequels in their minds,

01:15:29.360 --> 01:15:31.280
so they're they're going to they're going to with everything

01:15:31.280 --> 01:15:32.320
I think you're right on that.

01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:36.240
It'll be the originals, maybe Phong Minh and the Doctor,

01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:38.880
just because of her popularity in particular.

01:15:39.440 --> 01:15:41.040
And I think you're right that maybe the nurse.

01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:44.240
But it would be those early DLC characters only.

01:15:44.240 --> 01:15:48.560
And like they're going to save later releases for sequels.

01:15:48.560 --> 01:15:49.200
Absolutely.

01:15:49.200 --> 01:15:52.800
Like you're not going to see more popular later killers like bleep

01:15:52.800 --> 01:15:53.680
or anything like that.

01:15:53.680 --> 01:15:55.360
They won't be in the movie.

01:15:55.360 --> 01:15:59.040
Well, and by then, though, I mean, it could very well be possible

01:15:59.120 --> 01:16:02.240
it could very well be possible that they'd have, you know,

01:16:02.240 --> 01:16:06.640
enough interest and revenue from it to invest in the licensed characters.

01:16:08.560 --> 01:16:09.440
There's a possibility.

01:16:09.440 --> 01:16:12.240
I'm just throwing it out there, although honestly,

01:16:12.240 --> 01:16:15.360
I would love to see the Dredge.

01:16:17.360 --> 01:16:20.000
I think I also don't know if we should write off

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:21.520
the licensed killers completely.

01:16:21.520 --> 01:16:23.920
I think, you know, if they could get the rights,

01:16:23.920 --> 01:16:26.400
I think especially a cameo at the end.

01:16:26.400 --> 01:16:28.800
Imagine right before the credits or at the end of the movie

01:16:29.360 --> 01:16:32.160
I don't know why, but I feel like the most likely one to show up,

01:16:32.160 --> 01:16:36.400
because what else is he doing these days besides getting his own video game, Bubba?

01:16:36.400 --> 01:16:38.560
I think if Leatherface showed up at the end of the movie,

01:16:40.080 --> 01:16:43.600
I only say this because I feel like he's got the best chance

01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:46.560
versus like a Freddy or, you know, some of the other license.

01:16:46.560 --> 01:16:48.240
Freddy would have a better chance.

01:16:48.240 --> 01:16:49.280
You really do.

01:16:49.280 --> 01:16:52.000
Nothing is happening with the Nightmare on Elm Street license.

01:16:52.960 --> 01:16:54.240
You know, the other reason?

01:16:54.240 --> 01:16:56.400
Well, here's the other reason why I say Bubba,

01:16:56.400 --> 01:16:59.600
because they could put, and it's to be fair, Michael Myers,

01:16:59.600 --> 01:17:00.720
they could do this, too.

01:17:00.720 --> 01:17:02.320
They could put anybody under the mask.

01:17:03.200 --> 01:17:05.840
With Freddy, all everybody's going to say is,

01:17:05.840 --> 01:17:06.960
why isn't it Robert Englund?

01:17:07.760 --> 01:17:09.040
That's going to be the problem.

01:17:09.680 --> 01:17:11.280
A mask killer, they could put anyone under the mask.

01:17:11.280 --> 01:17:12.640
I just don't see them going that way at all.

01:17:12.640 --> 01:17:15.760
I see them keeping Hillbilly and not putting in Bubba.

01:17:16.400 --> 01:17:19.120
You know, I see, I mean, and who knows,

01:17:19.120 --> 01:17:22.160
there might even just be an original killer

01:17:22.160 --> 01:17:24.560
that like you do something with your ticket

01:17:24.560 --> 01:17:25.840
and you get them in the game.

01:17:25.840 --> 01:17:26.880
I bet they're going to do DLC.

01:17:26.880 --> 01:17:30.160
Oh, it debuts in the movie and then is dealing.

01:17:30.160 --> 01:17:31.120
Oh, yeah.

01:17:31.120 --> 01:17:31.680
Oh, yeah.

01:17:32.240 --> 01:17:33.680
Anyway, yeah.

01:17:33.680 --> 01:17:35.600
Tigerfly says, doesn't Dead by Daylight

01:17:35.600 --> 01:17:36.880
mostly have original characters?

01:17:36.880 --> 01:17:38.640
The license stuff can't be a part of the movie.

01:17:38.640 --> 01:17:42.240
Yes, but that's not, I mean, it's money in her grievance.

01:17:42.240 --> 01:17:42.880
That's a pretty good split still.

01:17:42.880 --> 01:17:44.000
Never say never.

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:44.800
Yeah, it's a good split.

01:17:45.840 --> 01:17:50.640
But at any rate, you know, I mean, we're talking about,

01:17:50.640 --> 01:17:52.640
you know, not just like you said, Megan,

01:17:52.640 --> 01:17:55.360
they did, you know, Malignant, Paranormal Activity,

01:17:55.440 --> 01:17:56.480
Blackphone, you know.

01:17:57.760 --> 01:17:58.400
There's a lot.

01:17:58.400 --> 01:18:00.160
It's really a lot.

01:18:00.160 --> 01:18:04.080
And also, Blumhouse announced the launch of Blumhouse Games

01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:07.280
that will do indie budget video games.

01:18:08.800 --> 01:18:10.640
They'll produce and publish for under 10 mil.

01:18:12.560 --> 01:18:16.720
So I wonder if we might start seeing collaborations as well

01:18:16.720 --> 01:18:19.760
or like, you know, other DVD spinoffs like Hooked on You,

01:18:20.400 --> 01:18:22.160
but on like the indie field.

01:18:22.480 --> 01:18:22.980
Hmm.

01:18:23.520 --> 01:18:25.520
So I mean, there's like lots of,

01:18:27.200 --> 01:18:30.400
lots of, you know, potential for this.

01:18:30.400 --> 01:18:34.800
I really think that they've got the right people on this.

01:18:35.520 --> 01:18:37.520
And I mean, it's still early days, you know,

01:18:37.520 --> 01:18:39.760
they don't have a director or a screenwriter.

01:18:40.480 --> 01:18:43.600
So I mean, I would reckon we would see this

01:18:43.600 --> 01:18:45.600
maybe in two to three years.

01:18:47.280 --> 01:18:49.440
And who knows where DVD will be by then,

01:18:49.440 --> 01:18:52.320
although knowing behavior, it will still, you know,

01:18:52.320 --> 01:18:55.040
be a little bit broken, but very interesting.

01:18:55.040 --> 01:18:57.600
And people will still be complaining about MMR.

01:18:57.600 --> 01:19:00.160
That's also a very good point.

01:19:00.160 --> 01:19:02.880
I mean, I don't want to speak this harshly,

01:19:02.880 --> 01:19:05.120
but this is the only sentence that comes to mind is,

01:19:05.120 --> 01:19:07.680
will DVD still be as relevant in the gaming world

01:19:07.680 --> 01:19:10.640
by the time this movie hits or has the time to strike

01:19:10.640 --> 01:19:13.200
when the iron is hot, so to speak, already passed?

01:19:13.200 --> 01:19:15.120
People asked that question three years ago

01:19:15.120 --> 01:19:16.000
when I started playing.

01:19:16.640 --> 01:19:18.480
Okay, fair answer.

01:19:19.920 --> 01:19:22.400
But actually, SSJ 100 Matt brings up a good point.

01:19:22.400 --> 01:19:24.320
Michael Myers makes the most sense, really.

01:19:24.320 --> 01:19:26.240
Blumhouse and Danny McBride have been doing

01:19:26.240 --> 01:19:27.920
those recent Halloween movies.

01:19:27.920 --> 01:19:29.200
Oh, I did.

01:19:29.200 --> 01:19:30.000
Oh, that's right.

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.240
It is Blumhouse that did the reboot trilogy.

01:19:32.240 --> 01:19:32.880
Okay.

01:19:32.880 --> 01:19:34.080
No, you're right.

01:19:34.080 --> 01:19:34.960
I changed my answer.

01:19:35.840 --> 01:19:36.640
Yeah, and they're doing,

01:19:37.200 --> 01:19:39.600
he also says they're doing a new Exorcist movie.

01:19:39.600 --> 01:19:44.000
I doubt very seriously that we'll have, you know,

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:45.280
a pea soup vomiting.

01:19:46.640 --> 01:19:47.920
We already have.

01:19:47.920 --> 01:19:48.960
Oh my God.

01:19:48.960 --> 01:19:50.400
It just occurred to me, Rob.

01:19:52.240 --> 01:19:55.840
If the plague might've been an attempt

01:19:55.840 --> 01:20:00.400
to license the Exorcist and it didn't work.

01:20:01.200 --> 01:20:02.080
Maybe, I don't know.

01:20:02.080 --> 01:20:03.040
I don't know.

01:20:03.040 --> 01:20:06.640
Although they're saying though that the new killer,

01:20:06.640 --> 01:20:11.520
the Skull Merchant is a failed attempt to get Predator.

01:20:11.520 --> 01:20:13.280
Yeah, I've heard that too.

01:20:13.360 --> 01:20:13.920
Yep.

01:20:13.920 --> 01:20:14.420
Yeah.

01:20:14.960 --> 01:20:15.680
Interesting.

01:20:15.680 --> 01:20:19.280
But you know, you know, though the fandom,

01:20:19.280 --> 01:20:21.520
the loyal fans stay loyal, right?

01:20:21.520 --> 01:20:22.080
Yep.

01:20:22.080 --> 01:20:24.400
And even people who walk away from the game,

01:20:25.600 --> 01:20:27.600
they, a lot of people come back.

01:20:28.320 --> 01:20:29.120
I hope if they do-

01:20:29.120 --> 01:20:30.080
There'll be something that comes out

01:20:30.080 --> 01:20:30.880
that'll bring them back.

01:20:31.600 --> 01:20:33.200
It's interesting because with this movie,

01:20:33.200 --> 01:20:35.600
I hope that it's very similar advice

01:20:35.600 --> 01:20:37.040
to what I just said to Square Enix.

01:20:37.600 --> 01:20:39.920
I hope they don't spend too much money on it.

01:20:40.560 --> 01:20:43.440
I hope they get, you know, some good up and coming,

01:20:43.440 --> 01:20:46.080
but horror movies usually are not expensive.

01:20:46.080 --> 01:20:46.720
They are usually on the cheap to me.

01:20:46.720 --> 01:20:48.960
I want to know what Tiger Claw is talking about DVDs.

01:20:48.960 --> 01:20:51.600
Cause we said DBD, Dead by Daylight.

01:20:54.160 --> 01:20:54.720
All right.

01:20:54.720 --> 01:20:55.200
Anyway.

01:20:55.200 --> 01:20:57.200
I don't know if that's serious or a joke.

01:20:57.200 --> 01:20:57.700
All right.

01:20:58.240 --> 01:20:58.880
Let's move on.

01:20:59.680 --> 01:21:00.800
Let's get to our next story,

01:21:00.800 --> 01:21:03.680
which is not as funny, unfortunately.

01:21:03.680 --> 01:21:04.180
Loki.

01:21:04.960 --> 01:21:06.800
No, unfortunately not.

01:21:06.800 --> 01:21:11.600
So EA has laid off 200 Apex Legends testers

01:21:11.600 --> 01:21:15.200
and they did it over a remote meeting call.

01:21:15.200 --> 01:21:17.840
So an unscheduled mandatory Zoom meeting.

01:21:19.840 --> 01:21:23.120
And so they had, actually with their

01:21:23.920 --> 01:21:27.120
contracting agency, Magnet Global,

01:21:27.840 --> 01:21:33.920
and basically that they were let go as part of that.

01:21:33.920 --> 01:21:36.480
The test, these, you know, basically EAs come out

01:21:36.480 --> 01:21:40.000
and they haven't made a comment yet regarding the layouts,

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.880
but testing games is an integral part of delivering

01:21:42.880 --> 01:21:44.560
the best experiences to our players.

01:21:44.560 --> 01:21:46.000
They said that in PR speak.

01:21:49.120 --> 01:21:52.640
But yeah, it's basically that they are testing team

01:21:52.640 --> 01:21:54.880
and ending testing execution.

01:21:54.880 --> 01:21:58.720
That's been concentrated in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.

01:21:58.720 --> 01:22:00.400
It says impacted services provided

01:22:00.400 --> 01:22:02.400
by our third party providers.

01:22:02.400 --> 01:22:05.440
Our global team, inclusive of remote play testers

01:22:05.440 --> 01:22:07.040
across the United States,

01:22:07.040 --> 01:22:09.760
enable us to increase hours per week and blah, blah, blah.

01:22:11.040 --> 01:22:14.160
So maybe they're just, you know, reducing staff

01:22:14.160 --> 01:22:15.520
for different testing.

01:22:15.520 --> 01:22:17.680
I don't know, but I don't know.

01:22:17.680 --> 01:22:19.600
It's always bad news, especially when you do it,

01:22:19.600 --> 01:22:21.760
like over like a remote meeting like that.

01:22:21.760 --> 01:22:23.440
I guess I understand if they're all remote,

01:22:23.440 --> 01:22:25.600
let me have them in the office to do it in person,

01:22:25.600 --> 01:22:28.400
but something a little bit more personable probably

01:22:28.400 --> 01:22:30.640
instead of just, okay, you're all let go.

01:22:31.360 --> 01:22:34.800
Like at least an email or something, a letter.

01:22:35.680 --> 01:22:36.180
Yeah.

01:22:37.760 --> 01:22:38.480
I don't know.

01:22:38.480 --> 01:22:40.480
Like the one time I was laid off,

01:22:40.480 --> 01:22:43.120
they had everybody together and made the announcement,

01:22:43.120 --> 01:22:44.160
although I wasn't there for it

01:22:44.160 --> 01:22:45.200
because I was on medical leave.

01:22:47.520 --> 01:22:51.680
But I think that doing it by Zoom would be the equivalent

01:22:51.680 --> 01:22:53.760
of calling an in-house company meeting.

01:22:54.480 --> 01:22:56.160
I don't see any problem with it.

01:22:57.280 --> 01:23:00.320
For remote where it still sucks that it's 200 people,

01:23:00.640 --> 01:23:01.200
being let go.

01:23:01.920 --> 01:23:03.920
But I mean that method because quite like,

01:23:03.920 --> 01:23:05.680
and this is actually what happened with mine,

01:23:06.880 --> 01:23:10.080
is that when they sold the company

01:23:10.080 --> 01:23:12.880
and we were all outsourced, they gathered everyone,

01:23:12.880 --> 01:23:16.800
said it in person and letters came out like the following week.

01:23:17.840 --> 01:23:21.360
And maybe that's where it feels a little oof

01:23:21.360 --> 01:23:24.160
is because it was Zoom calls with 200 people

01:23:24.160 --> 01:23:26.080
and even if it's 200 people in person,

01:23:26.080 --> 01:23:28.560
maybe it doesn't feel as personable.

01:23:28.560 --> 01:23:30.880
Whereas maybe even if they've done something as simple as

01:23:30.880 --> 01:23:34.080
do it in a Zoom call with 10 people at a time.

01:23:34.080 --> 01:23:36.400
Yes, it's a lot more work to do it that way,

01:23:36.400 --> 01:23:38.640
but it might feel a lot more personable

01:23:38.640 --> 01:23:39.360
and you're able to be,

01:23:39.360 --> 01:23:42.000
I mean, ideally you do it one at a time,

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.480
but I understand there has to be a compromise here.

01:23:45.200 --> 01:23:47.760
Where maybe do it team by team or something

01:23:47.760 --> 01:23:49.440
where you can answer some of the questions,

01:23:49.440 --> 01:23:50.880
concerns a little more directly

01:23:50.880 --> 01:23:52.880
and at least have that human side of it,

01:23:52.880 --> 01:23:55.520
which is impossible to get in a group of 200

01:23:55.520 --> 01:23:57.280
where people aren't really going to be able to ask questions,

01:23:57.280 --> 01:23:58.400
but in chat.

01:23:58.480 --> 01:24:03.680
So maybe that's where it feels a little bleh.

01:24:04.720 --> 01:24:08.000
One actually good thing with a chat format like that

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000
is that it also helps you field questions.

01:24:11.600 --> 01:24:13.200
Because a bunch of people are going to be asking

01:24:13.200 --> 01:24:14.000
the same question,

01:24:15.840 --> 01:24:17.760
so you can actually field questions

01:24:18.320 --> 01:24:21.280
and lump in the similar questions together.

01:24:21.440 --> 01:24:21.940
Mm-hmm.

01:24:22.480 --> 01:24:25.360
You know, and you could also just,

01:24:26.080 --> 01:24:30.080
it helps with efficiency and delivering the information

01:24:30.080 --> 01:24:31.920
because you can't really do that when,

01:24:32.560 --> 01:24:34.800
you know, you have a big meeting,

01:24:34.800 --> 01:24:36.240
because I mean, in my experience,

01:24:36.240 --> 01:24:37.840
like meetings like that,

01:24:37.840 --> 01:24:39.120
like big business meetings,

01:24:39.120 --> 01:24:41.600
don't really open the floor to questions.

01:24:42.640 --> 01:24:44.800
They just say, get in touch with HR.

01:24:45.520 --> 01:24:46.020
Yeah.

01:24:46.560 --> 01:24:50.160
So I could see this as actually being a good opportunity

01:24:50.160 --> 01:24:52.160
to field questions about it as well.

01:24:52.160 --> 01:24:52.660
Yeah.

01:24:54.320 --> 01:24:55.440
I don't think it's as negative

01:24:55.440 --> 01:24:56.640
as people are making it out to be.

01:24:57.440 --> 01:24:57.840
Yeah.

01:24:57.840 --> 01:24:58.880
Well, on the flip side-

01:24:58.880 --> 01:25:00.000
Other than losing a job.

01:25:00.960 --> 01:25:02.240
We have Activision,

01:25:02.240 --> 01:25:04.800
who is now coming under fire

01:25:04.800 --> 01:25:07.200
by the Communications Workers of America,

01:25:07.200 --> 01:25:10.240
who filed charges against the publisher

01:25:10.240 --> 01:25:14.240
in regards to firing two QA testers

01:25:15.280 --> 01:25:18.560
over apparently the use of strong language.

01:25:18.560 --> 01:25:21.200
So two QA testers have expressed their outrage

01:25:21.200 --> 01:25:25.040
using strong language in response to management

01:25:25.040 --> 01:25:27.760
set up disciplinary meetings

01:25:27.760 --> 01:25:29.680
where both workers were fired.

01:25:30.240 --> 01:25:33.120
And apparently the CWA is saying

01:25:33.120 --> 01:25:35.120
that the use of outbursts and strong language

01:25:35.120 --> 01:25:38.480
in the context of concerted activity by employees

01:25:38.480 --> 01:25:41.920
was protected by the National Labor Relations Board

01:25:43.520 --> 01:25:46.720
even up until 2020 where it was tested.

01:25:47.280 --> 01:25:50.000
And then they said that Activision says,

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:51.760
we don't allow employees to use profane

01:25:51.760 --> 01:25:53.680
or abusive language against each other.

01:25:55.520 --> 01:25:56.240
Really?

01:25:56.240 --> 01:25:56.960
Really, you don't?

01:25:57.840 --> 01:25:58.340
Right.

01:25:58.340 --> 01:25:59.840
We should listen to Michael first.

01:25:59.840 --> 01:26:02.480
We're disappointed that the CWA advocates

01:26:02.480 --> 01:26:04.160
this type of behavior.

01:26:04.720 --> 01:26:06.000
It sounds like an excuse.

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:07.600
Were they trying to unionize?

01:26:07.600 --> 01:26:09.120
I mean, I could see something like that.

01:26:09.520 --> 01:26:18.880
So yeah, more fire, it's more of the same, it seems like.

01:26:18.880 --> 01:26:26.880
More of Activision finding creative ways to fire people,

01:26:28.080 --> 01:26:30.400
especially those protesting their practices.

01:26:33.520 --> 01:26:36.880
Well, now that's a good question.

01:26:37.520 --> 01:26:40.480
Well, now that's just shady,

01:26:40.480 --> 01:26:42.800
but unfortunately completely unsurprising

01:26:42.800 --> 01:26:44.640
coming from Activision, to be quite honest.

01:26:44.640 --> 01:26:48.240
So hopefully the acquisition of their company

01:26:48.240 --> 01:26:49.600
can't happen soon enough.

01:26:49.600 --> 01:26:50.640
Clean house, you know?

01:26:50.640 --> 01:26:51.140
Yeah.

01:26:51.680 --> 01:26:52.400
At the top.

01:26:52.400 --> 01:26:54.240
At the top is where the layoffs need to happen.

01:26:55.440 --> 01:26:57.200
All right, moving on.

01:26:57.200 --> 01:26:59.360
Let's talk about Final Fantasy XVI.

01:26:59.360 --> 01:27:00.640
I brought it up later in the show,

01:27:00.640 --> 01:27:01.920
but it was actually in the news,

01:27:01.920 --> 01:27:03.600
or excuse me, earlier in the show I brought it up.

01:27:03.600 --> 01:27:05.280
But it's been in the news quite a bit this week

01:27:05.280 --> 01:27:07.600
because some press previews happened this week

01:27:07.600 --> 01:27:11.040
where I think folks got to play a several hour demo of it,

01:27:11.040 --> 01:27:12.720
probably in a controlled environment,

01:27:12.720 --> 01:27:14.960
and kind of got to experience a lot of the battle,

01:27:14.960 --> 01:27:16.000
kind of got to play with that.

01:27:16.960 --> 01:27:18.000
Because I've been out,

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.160
I have not caught up on the videos of it.

01:27:20.160 --> 01:27:22.240
I've just kind of watched a little bit.

01:27:22.240 --> 01:27:24.800
So I used to watch Skill Up.

01:27:24.800 --> 01:27:27.840
Maybe I should look some up and get some live thoughts here.

01:27:29.840 --> 01:27:31.600
So they flew them out to Japan

01:27:31.600 --> 01:27:33.520
to play a few different sections of the game.

01:27:33.520 --> 01:27:37.360
So one of it was a bit early on in the game

01:27:37.360 --> 01:27:39.520
that kind of focused on,

01:27:39.520 --> 01:27:43.120
because I guess it jumps between you as like a teenager

01:27:43.120 --> 01:27:45.360
and you as kind of like grown up as well.

01:27:45.920 --> 01:27:48.640
And so it started off like as a teenager

01:27:48.640 --> 01:27:51.200
where it's more of like a combat tutorial type thing,

01:27:51.200 --> 01:27:52.960
kind of getting used to that.

01:27:52.960 --> 01:27:56.640
And then they threw into another section of the game

01:27:56.640 --> 01:27:58.000
where it was just basic combat.

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:01.600
And then one of the, I forget what they call it now,

01:28:01.600 --> 01:28:06.240
the, not idols, but it's basically where the giant

01:28:06.240 --> 01:28:08.160
like a kaiju battle type thing,

01:28:08.160 --> 01:28:10.080
where they're both the summons or whatever,

01:28:10.080 --> 01:28:12.080
and they were doing a battle like that.

01:28:12.640 --> 01:28:14.960
So they had those three sections of the game to play

01:28:15.680 --> 01:28:17.440
to kind of get a taste of it.

01:28:18.640 --> 01:28:20.480
Okay, so I actually, while you've been talking,

01:28:20.480 --> 01:28:21.040
I pulled up,

01:28:21.040 --> 01:28:23.280
because I actually have not watched any of this at all.

01:28:23.280 --> 01:28:24.480
So I actually just pulled up.

01:28:24.480 --> 01:28:25.280
I went to YouTube.

01:28:25.280 --> 01:28:28.640
Of course, some of the extended gameplay stuff

01:28:28.640 --> 01:28:29.840
has hit YouTube.

01:28:30.800 --> 01:28:33.120
Interesting, because you know what it kind of evokes to me

01:28:33.120 --> 01:28:36.240
at first is that recent Strangers of Paradise spinoff

01:28:36.240 --> 01:28:36.880
a little bit.

01:28:36.880 --> 01:28:38.960
It's kind of what I'm feeling a little bit from this,

01:28:38.960 --> 01:28:39.600
but we'll see.

01:28:39.600 --> 01:28:40.960
I mean, here's the thing.

01:28:40.960 --> 01:28:44.800
Well, you know who's designing the game designer?

01:28:44.800 --> 01:28:46.640
Oh yeah, the guy from Devil May Cry and all that.

01:28:46.640 --> 01:28:47.360
Yeah, exactly.

01:28:47.360 --> 01:28:49.440
So it plays very similar to that.

01:28:49.440 --> 01:28:53.280
Yeah, so I'm curious about it.

01:28:53.280 --> 01:28:56.640
And the reality is Final Fantasy has been a little rooted

01:28:56.640 --> 01:29:00.400
more in action between 15 and the seven remake.

01:29:00.400 --> 01:29:02.400
You know, it's just kind of the direction it's been going.

01:29:02.400 --> 01:29:05.600
But I'm still, you know, there's certainly elements

01:29:05.600 --> 01:29:08.640
of the classic Final Fantasies, the games I see in here.

01:29:08.640 --> 01:29:09.360
So we'll see.

01:29:09.360 --> 01:29:11.520
I mean, I'm not sure I'm really going to know

01:29:11.520 --> 01:29:13.200
until I get my hands on it for myself

01:29:13.200 --> 01:29:15.280
and make my own perceptions.

01:29:15.280 --> 01:29:20.160
But there's definitely like graphically, very yes.

01:29:20.800 --> 01:29:22.640
Like very yes, graphically.

01:29:22.640 --> 01:29:25.600
Like I get like kind of like an Elden Ring, you know,

01:29:25.600 --> 01:29:27.760
meets Final Fantasy type of vibe from it.

01:29:27.760 --> 01:29:30.560
And I think it's going to look really good when it comes out.

01:29:30.560 --> 01:29:31.440
We'll see.

01:29:31.440 --> 01:29:33.680
But anyway, not only did the press preview happen,

01:29:33.680 --> 01:29:38.800
but there were some talk about how long does the story take?

01:29:38.800 --> 01:29:40.560
How long of a game does this take to get through?

01:29:41.440 --> 01:29:44.560
And it's going to take about 35 hours to complete.

01:29:45.520 --> 01:29:47.520
Apparently this will actually double

01:29:47.520 --> 01:29:49.040
when you do side content.

01:29:49.040 --> 01:29:52.480
There will be 11 hours worth of cut scenes.

01:29:52.480 --> 01:29:54.320
Well, after all, it is a Final Fantasy game.

01:29:54.320 --> 01:29:55.680
So I can't say I'm that surprised.

01:29:56.720 --> 01:29:58.560
The main story will take 35 hours to beat.

01:29:58.560 --> 01:29:59.840
But Yoshida added to that.

01:29:59.840 --> 01:30:02.880
If you do 100% completion, so you do all the cut scenes,

01:30:02.880 --> 01:30:05.200
you're looking at 70 to 80 hours.

01:30:05.200 --> 01:30:07.440
The main story was originally going to be 20 hours.

01:30:07.440 --> 01:30:08.320
Don't make any plans.

01:30:08.320 --> 01:30:09.360
Yeah, don't make plans.

01:30:09.360 --> 01:30:11.360
But this number increased during development,

01:30:11.360 --> 01:30:13.360
which isn't surprising either.

01:30:14.080 --> 01:30:15.920
So yeah, this number does not include cut scene

01:30:15.920 --> 01:30:17.280
and side quests and all of that.

01:30:17.280 --> 01:30:19.120
So there will be lots and lots.

01:30:20.720 --> 01:30:23.520
Yoshida did say, and this is not a great

01:30:24.640 --> 01:30:26.960
quote here, but he has said that the team has been working

01:30:26.960 --> 01:30:30.960
to death in order to get the game finished by summer 2023.

01:30:30.960 --> 01:30:32.480
I might have chose my words differently,

01:30:32.480 --> 01:30:33.920
but it is what it is.

01:30:35.200 --> 01:30:39.600
So yeah, it is set to launch in June, later in June.

01:30:39.600 --> 01:30:44.160
So I'm trying to look at this without the ad blocking

01:30:44.160 --> 01:30:46.320
things there, but that is, oh, that's the whole,

01:30:46.320 --> 01:30:48.800
yeah, they have the summon versus summon fight.

01:30:48.800 --> 01:30:50.560
So it looks like in this particular fight,

01:30:50.560 --> 01:30:53.520
you're actually controlling either Garuda

01:30:53.520 --> 01:30:55.920
or maybe Ifrit, I can't tell in this fight,

01:30:57.040 --> 01:30:59.120
but you're actually doing like a summon versus summon.

01:30:59.120 --> 01:31:00.000
It does look pretty cool.

01:31:00.640 --> 01:31:04.240
So it's got a lot of flourish to it.

01:31:06.160 --> 01:31:08.320
I mean, there's no, I was going to buy this game

01:31:08.320 --> 01:31:10.400
the minute they announced that Creative Business Unit 3

01:31:10.400 --> 01:31:11.280
was working on it.

01:31:11.280 --> 01:31:13.440
So we'll see.

01:31:13.440 --> 01:31:15.200
And I know I'll be streaming a lot of it as well.

01:31:17.040 --> 01:31:20.720
Let's see, is there some comments in chat about the length?

01:31:20.720 --> 01:31:23.760
DJ Rama S says, 35 hours, that's kind of light.

01:31:23.760 --> 01:31:26.240
Mike Def says, I don't need 100 plus hour experiences.

01:31:26.240 --> 01:31:27.520
Please keep it short and sweet.

01:31:28.400 --> 01:31:32.160
I actually think 35 hours is kind of on the longer end

01:31:32.160 --> 01:31:33.920
of where video games are at these days.

01:31:34.480 --> 01:31:39.120
Maybe not like something a little more retro inspired

01:31:39.120 --> 01:31:42.160
that has a lot of quests and stuff to, but keep in mind,

01:31:42.160 --> 01:31:45.360
they all are also saying, if you do all the side quests,

01:31:45.360 --> 01:31:47.920
which many people I know that play Final Fantasy do,

01:31:48.960 --> 01:31:50.320
it's going to be a lot longer.

01:31:50.400 --> 01:31:54.960
And so I'm not concerned about the time as much.

01:31:54.960 --> 01:31:56.880
I mean, but I reserve to change my mind

01:31:56.880 --> 01:31:58.480
once I have actually played the games.

01:31:59.040 --> 01:32:00.960
Questbuster says, so the previews I've watched,

01:32:00.960 --> 01:32:02.640
my impressions is that it's Final Fantasy

01:32:02.640 --> 01:32:04.240
with the Devil May Cry feel to it.

01:32:04.240 --> 01:32:07.040
You can swap between icon powers during battle.

01:32:07.600 --> 01:32:10.240
Questbuster also says, I love me those side quests.

01:32:10.240 --> 01:32:11.760
I went overboard with as many of those

01:32:11.760 --> 01:32:13.360
in Final Fantasy 15 as possible

01:32:13.360 --> 01:32:15.600
and maxed Noctis's party out.

01:32:15.600 --> 01:32:18.160
Well, apparently like side quests, DLC and all that,

01:32:18.160 --> 01:32:21.840
that's really the way to get the full Final Fantasy 15 experience.

01:32:21.840 --> 01:32:23.680
I just hope this game, you know,

01:32:23.680 --> 01:32:25.520
especially with the comment about this,

01:32:25.520 --> 01:32:27.440
basically openly admitting they're crunching.

01:32:28.240 --> 01:32:30.320
I hope with comments like that,

01:32:30.320 --> 01:32:35.840
this game is a fully finished, fully realized product.

01:32:35.840 --> 01:32:38.160
That's going to be the part that's disappointing to me.

01:32:38.160 --> 01:32:41.840
As long as it's 35 solid fucking hours, then great.

01:32:41.840 --> 01:32:44.400
But if it's 35 hours where it really feels like

01:32:44.400 --> 01:32:47.840
another 15 are missing, which is what Final Fantasy 15 felt like,

01:32:47.840 --> 01:32:48.880
I'm going to have some issues.

01:32:49.920 --> 01:32:52.640
And I am willing to hold this game,

01:32:53.520 --> 01:32:55.680
you know, accountable in the critical sense

01:32:55.680 --> 01:32:58.560
because just because I have a fondness

01:32:58.560 --> 01:33:00.560
of Creative Business Unit 3's previous game,

01:33:01.120 --> 01:33:03.920
I'm probably going to be harsher than most people

01:33:03.920 --> 01:33:05.680
on this game when it comes out, but we'll see.

01:33:06.560 --> 01:33:08.320
I'll be playing it live for sure.

01:33:08.320 --> 01:33:09.360
Absolutely.

01:33:09.360 --> 01:33:10.320
Whenever it comes out.

01:33:11.360 --> 01:33:11.760
All right.

01:33:11.760 --> 01:33:13.600
In the meantime, let's go to Dark Sakura

01:33:13.600 --> 01:33:15.840
and I'm going to step away from keyboard real quick.

01:33:15.840 --> 01:33:16.340
Sorry.

01:33:17.300 --> 01:33:18.260
You see how it is.

01:33:18.260 --> 01:33:19.300
I talk and you leave.

01:33:19.860 --> 01:33:21.380
I just need hydration.

01:33:21.380 --> 01:33:22.020
Forgive me.

01:33:22.580 --> 01:33:23.140
It's okay.

01:33:24.660 --> 01:33:29.860
Anyway, though, for fans of games that make you hate life

01:33:29.860 --> 01:33:34.420
and question your choices, Elden Ring is having an expansion

01:33:34.420 --> 01:33:36.580
called Shadow of Erdtree.

01:33:37.540 --> 01:33:39.220
It is currently in development,

01:33:39.220 --> 01:33:42.900
according to Bandai Namco and From Software.

01:33:43.460 --> 01:33:46.500
Um, the teaser says thus,

01:33:47.220 --> 01:33:50.420
Rise Tarnished and let us walk a new path together.

01:33:50.420 --> 01:33:52.900
An upcoming expansion for Elden Ring,

01:33:52.900 --> 01:33:55.620
Shadow of the Erdtree is currently in development.

01:33:55.620 --> 01:33:57.940
We hope you look forward to new adventures

01:33:57.940 --> 01:33:58.900
in the Lands Between.

01:33:59.620 --> 01:34:02.820
So yeah, there you go.

01:34:03.540 --> 01:34:07.060
Um, there's not really a whole lot of information

01:34:07.060 --> 01:34:07.700
out about it.

01:34:07.700 --> 01:34:09.380
I mean, I don't play Elden Ring,

01:34:10.100 --> 01:34:11.860
although I was tempted and then I realized

01:34:11.860 --> 01:34:12.740
I don't hate myself.

01:34:13.300 --> 01:34:18.740
So, but I mean, if, if people are looking forward to it,

01:34:18.740 --> 01:34:19.940
then I'm happy for y'all.

01:34:22.580 --> 01:34:23.080
Yeah.

01:34:24.340 --> 01:34:25.940
Did you play Elden Ring?

01:34:25.940 --> 01:34:28.980
Nope, there's no way I'm gonna play Elden Ring.

01:34:28.980 --> 01:34:32.180
Yeah, I have friends that like are super into it

01:34:32.180 --> 01:34:34.580
and, you know, die and die and die and die.

01:34:34.580 --> 01:34:37.860
And me, I just be like, no and no and no and no.

01:34:37.860 --> 01:34:41.460
You know, not, not me, no.

01:34:42.420 --> 01:34:45.140
It's like, I don't, I mean,

01:34:46.180 --> 01:34:48.260
but people like those Souls games, you know?

01:34:49.220 --> 01:34:53.700
Um, oh, Mike Duff says it's, it's been considered

01:34:53.700 --> 01:34:56.100
one of the most accessible Souls games.

01:34:56.740 --> 01:35:00.980
And I mean, I would be that person that plays like

01:35:00.980 --> 01:35:03.620
some sort of magic user that stands on a cliff

01:35:03.620 --> 01:35:06.580
and shoots, you know, whatever happens to be

01:35:06.580 --> 01:35:07.700
in firing range.

01:35:07.700 --> 01:35:09.780
Which I believe is the easy way, quote unquote,

01:35:09.780 --> 01:35:11.460
using my coin figures, easy way to play it.

01:35:14.020 --> 01:35:16.100
And I like, I've gone in and like watched videos,

01:35:16.100 --> 01:35:18.980
you know, like I watched, uh, the ending with

01:35:18.980 --> 01:35:20.260
whatever the moon lady is.

01:35:22.500 --> 01:35:26.260
Um, that was kind of cool, but, uh, I don't know.

01:35:26.260 --> 01:35:29.860
I mean, I'm happy for Elden Ring fans getting more content.

01:35:29.860 --> 01:35:32.980
I will be content to watch you play it and not play it myself.

01:35:32.980 --> 01:35:36.820
Yeah. I thought you'd, a lot of DVD streamers we know,

01:35:36.820 --> 01:35:38.820
especially the one you had lunch with today,

01:35:38.820 --> 01:35:40.660
I have started kind of playing this in some

01:35:40.660 --> 01:35:42.580
DVD downtime lately.

01:35:42.580 --> 01:35:45.220
So, um, definitely a game that even a year after

01:35:45.220 --> 01:35:47.140
it's been released is, uh, you know, kind of

01:35:47.780 --> 01:35:49.460
getting new fans showing up.

01:35:49.460 --> 01:35:50.420
So, yep.

01:35:52.020 --> 01:35:52.420
Cool.

01:35:52.420 --> 01:35:53.140
Yeah.

01:35:53.140 --> 01:35:53.460
All right.

01:35:53.460 --> 01:35:54.900
Um, moving on Loki.

01:35:56.420 --> 01:35:56.740
Yeah.

01:35:56.740 --> 01:35:59.220
So just kind of follow up to a story that we talked

01:35:59.220 --> 01:36:00.580
about a while ago.

01:36:01.060 --> 01:36:04.980
Yuji Naka getting in trouble with some insider trading.

01:36:04.980 --> 01:36:09.300
Well now, apparently during the court case, um, it has been,

01:36:10.260 --> 01:36:12.660
he has made the comment that there is no doubt.

01:36:12.660 --> 01:36:15.940
I knew the facts about the game before it was made

01:36:15.940 --> 01:36:17.620
public and bought the stock.

01:36:18.500 --> 01:36:20.580
And that's not necessarily admission of like,

01:36:20.580 --> 01:36:23.780
I did insider trading, but you got all the ingredients

01:36:23.780 --> 01:36:24.980
for insider trading.

01:36:24.980 --> 01:36:27.540
It almost sounds like he's pleading guilty,

01:36:27.540 --> 01:36:29.940
but he hasn't pled guilty yet.

01:36:29.940 --> 01:36:32.020
Well, at least he's owning up to it.

01:36:32.020 --> 01:36:33.540
That's more than most people do.

01:36:33.540 --> 01:36:34.500
I'll give him credit for that.

01:36:37.060 --> 01:36:37.560
Yep.

01:36:38.260 --> 01:36:44.500
So, um, I guess, I mean, this is a silly question to ask,

01:36:44.500 --> 01:36:46.740
but what I, cause I was gonna ask, is this the end

01:36:46.740 --> 01:36:47.860
of his gaming career?

01:36:47.860 --> 01:36:49.780
And abs, obviously the answer is yes.

01:36:49.780 --> 01:36:50.580
Oh, you think?

01:36:50.580 --> 01:36:50.820
No.

01:36:51.860 --> 01:36:52.900
I don't think it's the end of his gaming career.

01:36:52.900 --> 01:36:53.940
He's gonna go to jail.

01:36:54.740 --> 01:36:55.780
Well, you know what?

01:36:55.780 --> 01:36:58.020
Is he going to jail or is he getting a fine?

01:36:58.820 --> 01:36:59.620
That's, you know what?

01:36:59.620 --> 01:37:01.380
Jail didn't end Martha Stewart's career.

01:37:02.180 --> 01:37:03.620
So maybe, maybe you're right.

01:37:03.620 --> 01:37:06.580
Maybe, maybe this isn't going to be the end and we don't know.

01:37:06.580 --> 01:37:06.900
You're right.

01:37:06.900 --> 01:37:07.860
He might not get jail.

01:37:07.860 --> 01:37:10.100
He might just get a fine, especially if he's admitting

01:37:10.100 --> 01:37:10.900
to guilt.

01:37:10.900 --> 01:37:12.900
I don't know because I don't know the legal system.

01:37:12.900 --> 01:37:14.820
I barely understand the legal system here.

01:37:14.820 --> 01:37:16.180
I'm not going to try to understand the legal system

01:37:16.180 --> 01:37:17.060
in Japan.

01:37:17.060 --> 01:37:21.380
I just know certain things are viewed differently in the

01:37:21.380 --> 01:37:23.380
culture than others, and that can go either way.

01:37:24.660 --> 01:37:25.540
So we'll see.

01:37:25.860 --> 01:37:30.180
Quest Buster in chat says after Ballad Wonderland and now

01:37:30.180 --> 01:37:30.820
jail.

01:37:30.820 --> 01:37:34.500
Well, entire class says insider trading isn't a felony,

01:37:34.500 --> 01:37:34.740
right?

01:37:34.740 --> 01:37:36.020
Well, Martha Stewart went to jail.

01:37:37.220 --> 01:37:41.620
So granted, many people feel they were just trying to make

01:37:41.620 --> 01:37:44.020
an example of her, but she does.

01:37:44.020 --> 01:37:48.260
I mean, name a better duo than her and Snoop Dogg.

01:37:48.260 --> 01:37:48.980
I'll wait.

01:37:48.980 --> 01:37:50.900
Like, there really isn't one.

01:37:50.900 --> 01:37:53.780
So I mean, her career is in a great place.

01:37:53.780 --> 01:37:54.740
All things considered.

01:37:54.740 --> 01:37:55.700
So I don't know.

01:37:55.700 --> 01:37:59.220
It'd be interesting to see what happens with Yuji Naka

01:37:59.220 --> 01:38:00.100
artistically.

01:38:01.620 --> 01:38:02.020
Wow.

01:38:02.020 --> 01:38:07.140
Dejirama S says if the creator of Rurouni Kenshin, who is

01:38:07.140 --> 01:38:10.420
caught with child pornography, can get away with no jail time

01:38:10.420 --> 01:38:11.300
and pay a fine.

01:38:11.940 --> 01:38:12.260
Wow.

01:38:12.900 --> 01:38:15.140
Yuji Naka is just going to get a slap on the wrist.

01:38:16.500 --> 01:38:16.740
Wow.

01:38:18.340 --> 01:38:21.220
Phil of Nine says Martha Stewart, the original stunt queen

01:38:22.180 --> 01:38:25.700
and the only host of The Apprentice that has gone to jail

01:38:25.700 --> 01:38:26.260
so far.

01:38:28.500 --> 01:38:29.140
But we'll see.

01:38:30.900 --> 01:38:34.260
And she went to jail and paid her dues.

01:38:34.260 --> 01:38:36.980
I mean, I don't know.

01:38:36.980 --> 01:38:38.740
I don't know enough facts about that case.

01:38:38.740 --> 01:38:41.300
I don't want to sit here and go, Martha Stewart should or

01:38:41.300 --> 01:38:42.900
shouldn't have gone to jail because I don't really know.

01:38:42.900 --> 01:38:45.300
But it does seem like they made an example of her.

01:38:45.300 --> 01:38:49.620
I do get the impression that she has done things that maybe

01:38:49.620 --> 01:38:51.060
some other people should do.

01:38:51.620 --> 01:38:54.420
Other people that have hosted The Apprentice television show

01:38:54.420 --> 01:38:58.740
who have done other things that are worse than what Martha

01:38:58.740 --> 01:38:59.300
Stewart did.

01:39:00.500 --> 01:39:01.540
But what do I know?

01:39:01.540 --> 01:39:03.540
I'm just some guy on the internet with a podcast.

01:39:05.460 --> 01:39:06.100
All right.

01:39:06.100 --> 01:39:07.780
Anyway, let's move on.

01:39:08.580 --> 01:39:11.460
And for those watching live on Twitch, I see we have a special

01:39:11.460 --> 01:39:12.340
guest star tonight.

01:39:13.060 --> 01:39:14.580
We have Her Highness.

01:39:14.580 --> 01:39:15.060
Yes.

01:39:15.060 --> 01:39:16.180
Ms. Middlesbittittles.

01:39:16.500 --> 01:39:21.060
For those listening on the podcast, Dark Sakura has a cat

01:39:21.060 --> 01:39:23.860
not on her lap, like, literally in her arms next to the

01:39:23.860 --> 01:39:24.740
microphone right now.

01:39:24.740 --> 01:39:29.220
And unlike my cats, Middles is loving this attention.

01:39:29.860 --> 01:39:31.220
No, she's tolerating it.

01:39:31.220 --> 01:39:31.780
She's tolerating.

01:39:31.780 --> 01:39:32.980
She's tolerating this attention.

01:39:32.980 --> 01:39:35.620
I took her out of her warm spot because I wanted her to be

01:39:35.620 --> 01:39:36.340
a celebrity.

01:39:36.340 --> 01:39:36.840
Yeah.

01:39:37.540 --> 01:39:38.100
You want down?

01:39:38.820 --> 01:39:39.780
You want down?

01:39:39.780 --> 01:39:40.280
All right.

01:39:41.940 --> 01:39:43.060
Put me down, human.

01:39:43.060 --> 01:39:44.180
And time was up.

01:39:44.980 --> 01:39:45.300
All right.

01:39:45.300 --> 01:39:48.180
Well, speaking of pets, let's talk about Pokemon, because

01:39:48.180 --> 01:39:49.860
Pokemon Day happened this week.

01:39:49.860 --> 01:39:52.740
And with that came a Pokemon Presents stream.

01:39:53.460 --> 01:39:56.580
And so they talked about what is happening in Pokemon.

01:39:56.580 --> 01:39:59.380
And one of the biggest pieces of news that came out is that,

01:39:59.380 --> 01:40:02.100
yes, there is DLC coming for Scarlet and Violet.

01:40:02.100 --> 01:40:04.660
Of course, there's DLC coming from Scarlet and Violet.

01:40:05.380 --> 01:40:08.340
That will be coming out soon.

01:40:08.340 --> 01:40:10.020
I'm trying to see where the dates are for that.

01:40:12.340 --> 01:40:13.460
Fall and winter.

01:40:13.460 --> 01:40:13.940
Thank you.

01:40:13.940 --> 01:40:16.500
Fall and winter for the two pieces of DLC that are coming

01:40:16.500 --> 01:40:17.620
to Scarlet and Violet.

01:40:18.180 --> 01:40:20.980
Pokemon Go is also going to connect to Scarlet and Violet.

01:40:20.980 --> 01:40:22.740
And I believe that started this week.

01:40:22.740 --> 01:40:24.500
I haven't checked out that functionality yet, but I know

01:40:24.500 --> 01:40:28.580
it has to do a gimme ghoul and his release in Pokemon Go.

01:40:28.580 --> 01:40:30.980
So I'll have to check out that at some point.

01:40:30.980 --> 01:40:33.300
There's also more terror raids coming as well.

01:40:34.900 --> 01:40:37.540
The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero.

01:40:37.540 --> 01:40:39.780
That's the name of the DLC for that.

01:40:39.780 --> 01:40:40.260
Interesting.

01:40:40.260 --> 01:40:41.540
So it's not two different pieces.

01:40:41.540 --> 01:40:43.140
It's just part one and two.

01:40:43.140 --> 01:40:45.940
Also big news from the Pokemon Presents.

01:40:45.940 --> 01:40:47.140
Pokemon Sleep.

01:40:47.140 --> 01:40:47.860
It's back.

01:40:47.860 --> 01:40:48.500
It's real.

01:40:48.500 --> 01:40:49.460
It's coming.

01:40:49.460 --> 01:40:52.180
Pokemon Sleep is happening, and there's going to be a new

01:40:52.180 --> 01:40:54.900
device for it even called the Pokemon Go Plus.

01:40:56.500 --> 01:40:59.220
It's the Pokemon Go Plus Plus.

01:41:00.340 --> 01:41:02.820
It's an ATM machine machine, literally.

01:41:05.220 --> 01:41:06.980
The Trace Buster Buster.

01:41:08.020 --> 01:41:09.780
But anyway, it's coming.

01:41:09.780 --> 01:41:12.900
And if you wanted to get one too late, they're already sold

01:41:12.900 --> 01:41:15.300
out everywhere because this is the way Nintendo products

01:41:15.300 --> 01:41:16.740
and Nintendo affiliated.

01:41:16.740 --> 01:41:19.940
In this case, products tend to go, but it will actually

01:41:19.940 --> 01:41:21.300
measure your sleep and all that.

01:41:21.300 --> 01:41:24.500
And I think you get a Snorlax in Pokemon Go with, like, a

01:41:24.500 --> 01:41:25.700
sleepy time hat or something.

01:41:25.700 --> 01:41:26.900
If you get one of these.

01:41:26.900 --> 01:41:27.700
I don't know.

01:41:27.700 --> 01:41:30.180
It sounded like a lot of extra crap to me.

01:41:30.180 --> 01:41:31.940
I'm also I still don't.

01:41:31.940 --> 01:41:35.060
I'm not sure I understand the point of Pokemon Sleep other

01:41:35.060 --> 01:41:40.420
than Nintendo wants sleep data of children and adults who

01:41:40.420 --> 01:41:44.500
like Pokemon across the US and Canada and other places.

01:41:44.500 --> 01:41:46.500
For some reason, I don't know why they want to harvest that

01:41:46.500 --> 01:41:48.660
sleep data, but they're going to get it.

01:41:48.660 --> 01:41:50.660
And that's going to be interesting for whatever they

01:41:50.660 --> 01:41:52.820
might be cooking up in the future.

01:41:52.820 --> 01:41:57.300
So also some other things if you're big fans of the Pokemon

01:41:57.300 --> 01:42:00.980
series, such as Zacian is coming to Pokemon Unite.

01:42:01.540 --> 01:42:04.260
There is a new Netflix and Pokemon venture called Pokemon

01:42:04.260 --> 01:42:05.860
Concierge that's coming.

01:42:05.860 --> 01:42:08.340
There's a new set of Pokemon cards coming, but they'll be

01:42:08.340 --> 01:42:11.060
announced more at the Pokemon World Championship and the

01:42:11.060 --> 01:42:16.100
Pokemon Master Sex or the Masters EX.

01:42:16.100 --> 01:42:20.180
But everyone calls it Pokemon Master Sex for Pokemon Master

01:42:20.180 --> 01:42:20.740
Sex.

01:42:20.740 --> 01:42:24.100
Leon and Charizard will be back in that.

01:42:24.100 --> 01:42:24.820
So there's that.

01:42:24.820 --> 01:42:27.220
And what's that?

01:42:29.220 --> 01:42:30.500
You say the Lord, I'm done.

01:42:30.500 --> 01:42:31.000
Bye.

01:42:33.220 --> 01:42:33.860
People.

01:42:33.860 --> 01:42:34.900
Yeah, yeah, I know.

01:42:35.860 --> 01:42:36.260
All right.

01:42:37.220 --> 01:42:40.180
S.J. 100 Matt says it's gamifying health and wellness,

01:42:40.180 --> 01:42:41.300
and there's a market for that.

01:42:41.300 --> 01:42:41.700
Sure.

01:42:41.700 --> 01:42:42.820
And I eat that stuff up.

01:42:43.700 --> 01:42:46.180
And will I play Pokemon sleep?

01:42:46.180 --> 01:42:46.900
Probably.

01:42:47.460 --> 01:42:50.020
Will I recognize that there is something potentially

01:42:50.020 --> 01:42:53.940
problematic with me being so open with me sharing my sleep

01:42:53.940 --> 01:42:54.660
data?

01:42:54.660 --> 01:42:55.700
Probably.

01:42:55.700 --> 01:42:56.820
But you know what?

01:42:56.820 --> 01:42:59.860
I've been given way worse to Niantic for years.

01:43:01.060 --> 01:43:04.100
So whatever.

01:43:04.900 --> 01:43:07.460
Keep making the Pokemon cute, and who cares?

01:43:08.100 --> 01:43:10.420
All right, moving on.

01:43:10.420 --> 01:43:15.220
Let's go back to a simpler time when games weren't harvesting

01:43:15.220 --> 01:43:19.140
all of our data in a favorite segment we like to do here

01:43:19.140 --> 01:43:20.500
on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:43:31.060 --> 01:43:34.100
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time,

01:43:34.100 --> 01:43:37.460
where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic

01:43:37.460 --> 01:43:38.820
and tell you about it.

01:43:38.820 --> 01:43:41.460
It's time for the classic game of the week.

01:43:42.340 --> 01:43:43.460
OK, let me see.

01:43:43.460 --> 01:43:46.100
I think I have an audio cue for tonight's game.

01:43:46.660 --> 01:43:48.580
Let's see if I get this timed right with the title

01:43:48.580 --> 01:43:49.300
screen coming up.

01:43:51.140 --> 01:43:52.100
Oh, no.

01:43:52.100 --> 01:43:52.580
There we go.

01:43:52.580 --> 01:44:04.340
Oh, I thought I had the song that would play in the back.

01:44:07.060 --> 01:44:09.220
Oh, here we go from the top.

01:44:12.980 --> 01:44:13.540
There we go.

01:44:19.540 --> 01:44:20.580
All right.

01:44:20.580 --> 01:44:22.260
Obviously, you all know the game at this point.

01:44:23.300 --> 01:44:26.100
All right, so the game is Clay Fighter,

01:44:26.100 --> 01:44:31.780
which came out for the Super Nintendo on November 15, 1993.

01:44:32.740 --> 01:44:37.300
For PAL, it was released as Tournament Edition.

01:44:37.300 --> 01:44:38.420
Actually, I take that back.

01:44:38.420 --> 01:44:40.740
For PAL, it was released on May 26, 1994.

01:44:40.740 --> 01:44:43.540
Then there were other ones like the Tournament Edition

01:44:44.100 --> 01:44:47.620
on May 15, 1994 in North America.

01:44:47.620 --> 01:44:50.660
Genesis got theirs June 23, 1994.

01:44:50.660 --> 01:44:54.020
The PAL region January 1, 1995.

01:44:54.020 --> 01:44:57.220
And Virtual Console in Europe February 6,

01:44:57.220 --> 01:45:01.860
2009 in North America May 25, 2009.

01:45:01.860 --> 01:45:04.820
So every version of it is over 10 years old.

01:45:06.180 --> 01:45:08.500
So it qualifies a bunch.

01:45:10.100 --> 01:45:13.140
At any rate, Clay Fighter is a fighting game.

01:45:13.300 --> 01:45:13.800
Duh.

01:45:15.380 --> 01:45:20.260
That is a parody of Street Fighter and other fighting games.

01:45:21.860 --> 01:45:24.980
And it features like this circus theme

01:45:24.980 --> 01:45:28.580
and has like a claymation type graphics

01:45:29.620 --> 01:45:32.340
that were actually created with, you know,

01:45:32.340 --> 01:45:34.740
photography and digitalizing the clay models

01:45:34.740 --> 01:45:38.820
like something more Mortal Kombat-ish, but with clay models.

01:45:38.820 --> 01:45:47.700
The company Visual Concepts actually had another

01:45:47.700 --> 01:45:50.660
in their sort of clay themed franchises

01:45:50.660 --> 01:45:54.100
that were actually made by Interplay Productions.

01:45:54.100 --> 01:45:57.300
And one was called Claymates, which was a platformer.

01:45:58.980 --> 01:46:02.020
There were even toys.

01:46:02.020 --> 01:46:03.140
I don't know if they ever came out,

01:46:03.140 --> 01:46:07.460
but in July 2020, Megalopolis toys were partnered

01:46:07.460 --> 01:46:11.780
with Interplay to release a line of six injection figures

01:46:11.780 --> 01:46:13.940
based on the game, which is very interesting.

01:46:15.300 --> 01:46:16.740
Anyway, the plot is stupid.

01:46:17.380 --> 01:46:18.660
A meteor?

01:46:18.660 --> 01:46:19.160
What?

01:46:20.020 --> 01:46:21.540
The plot is stupid.

01:46:21.540 --> 01:46:22.020
It's great.

01:46:22.020 --> 01:46:22.580
It's great.

01:46:22.580 --> 01:46:23.940
Well, no, it is.

01:46:23.940 --> 01:46:24.440
It is.

01:46:25.540 --> 01:46:28.900
It's like a meteor made out of clay lands

01:46:28.900 --> 01:46:32.100
on like a little circus.

01:46:32.100 --> 01:46:33.940
And then all the goo from all of this

01:46:33.940 --> 01:46:36.500
contaminates all the circus's attractions

01:46:36.500 --> 01:46:38.900
and makes them bizarre caricatures

01:46:38.900 --> 01:46:41.300
of what they were before, but with superpowers.

01:46:42.180 --> 01:46:47.540
So I love like the characters in this are their names are fun.

01:46:47.540 --> 01:46:51.860
My favorite being bad Mr. Frosty, who's a snowman.

01:46:52.580 --> 01:46:54.980
And he has a very, very, very bad attitude.

01:46:56.180 --> 01:46:58.340
His attacks like are throwing snowballs

01:46:58.340 --> 01:47:02.900
and spitting sharp ice balls and sliding around.

01:47:03.860 --> 01:47:06.820
But I like his taunt because he says, I'm bad.

01:47:06.820 --> 01:47:07.540
I'm cool.

01:47:07.540 --> 01:47:08.500
I'm no one's fool.

01:47:09.860 --> 01:47:11.220
I always remembered that like that.

01:47:11.220 --> 01:47:14.820
Mr. Frosty is like like my guy.

01:47:18.020 --> 01:47:22.260
But there's also blob that's just like that was your guy.

01:47:22.820 --> 01:47:26.020
He was the master of Gujitsu and he can morph

01:47:26.020 --> 01:47:27.140
into different objects.

01:47:27.620 --> 01:47:29.380
And there was another one that I liked,

01:47:29.380 --> 01:47:32.500
which was blue suede goo, which is an Elvis impersonator.

01:47:34.100 --> 01:47:39.620
And he has he fights on the keys of a piano

01:47:39.620 --> 01:47:43.780
that says big hunk of burning clay as in hunk hunk of burning

01:47:43.780 --> 01:47:44.280
love.

01:47:44.900 --> 01:47:48.900
And of course, his name's a parody of blue suede shoes

01:47:48.900 --> 01:47:50.260
from the 1950s.

01:47:51.140 --> 01:47:53.300
Bonker is a clown, so I never played him.

01:47:53.940 --> 01:47:55.940
Bonker is a clown, so I never played him.

01:47:57.860 --> 01:48:01.940
He has like pies and cartwheels and a spring flower

01:48:01.940 --> 01:48:02.900
and a huge hammer.

01:48:03.780 --> 01:48:07.220
And he's got like two fun houses.

01:48:07.220 --> 01:48:08.580
One's a clown head and the other's

01:48:08.580 --> 01:48:09.940
like a giant rubber ducky.

01:48:12.180 --> 01:48:14.340
And then there's Helga, who is my other one,

01:48:14.340 --> 01:48:17.460
who is basically the proverbial fat lady that

01:48:17.460 --> 01:48:18.820
sings at the end of the opera.

01:48:19.780 --> 01:48:22.420
You know, totally wearing like the Viking attire.

01:48:23.860 --> 01:48:26.900
And she's actually the rival of blue suede goo.

01:48:28.260 --> 01:48:29.540
And my main for the record.

01:48:30.900 --> 01:48:34.100
My main for the record, because I always played women

01:48:34.100 --> 01:48:34.820
in fighting games.

01:48:34.820 --> 01:48:35.320
Always.

01:48:35.940 --> 01:48:39.140
Well, she would like launch herself like with her full head

01:48:40.260 --> 01:48:42.340
and like because she had the horns on her head

01:48:42.340 --> 01:48:45.780
and then she would also do like the sonic scream,

01:48:45.780 --> 01:48:47.780
you know, the operatic thing.

01:48:48.580 --> 01:48:53.140
And she's actually the first opponent in single player mode

01:48:53.140 --> 01:48:54.580
and she has like an opera theater.

01:48:55.220 --> 01:48:57.860
Then there's Ichibod Clay, who we're actually

01:48:57.860 --> 01:49:01.540
seeing on the video fighting against the next one, Taffy.

01:49:01.540 --> 01:49:04.740
But Ichibod Clay is a scarecrow with a pumpkin head

01:49:04.740 --> 01:49:07.220
who can teleport and throw ectoplasm.

01:49:08.020 --> 01:49:12.660
The next one is Taffy, who is a gooey.

01:49:13.300 --> 01:49:14.420
He's basically Gumby.

01:49:14.980 --> 01:49:17.060
Yeah, I don't know.

01:49:17.700 --> 01:49:20.340
I think he's like, he looks more like a tapeworm to me.

01:49:20.340 --> 01:49:23.620
But anyway, he can twist himself up and spin

01:49:23.620 --> 01:49:25.140
and flail his arms.

01:49:25.140 --> 01:49:27.620
And in one player mode, he actually,

01:49:28.580 --> 01:49:32.180
his levels are like two different Taffy factories.

01:49:32.180 --> 01:49:35.540
And then there's Tiny, which is a buff,

01:49:35.540 --> 01:49:39.300
very toothy wrestler character who poses.

01:49:39.940 --> 01:49:41.540
But he doesn't actually use wrestling moves.

01:49:41.540 --> 01:49:42.580
He just punches.

01:49:42.580 --> 01:49:44.820
He charges and punches and rolls into a ball

01:49:44.820 --> 01:49:46.580
and throws himself at people.

01:49:48.740 --> 01:49:52.100
And then the final boss is called End Boss,

01:49:52.100 --> 01:49:58.260
End Period Boss, that looks like a ring of balls

01:49:59.300 --> 01:50:01.220
or maybe like a weird necklace.

01:50:02.020 --> 01:50:06.420
And it has round eyes, one open, one half closed.

01:50:07.060 --> 01:50:08.740
And it attacks with projectiles that

01:50:08.740 --> 01:50:11.220
are copied from other characters in a grab attack.

01:50:11.460 --> 01:50:13.380
He does not appear to be made of clay

01:50:13.380 --> 01:50:16.900
and the announcer does not enter, announce his name

01:50:17.620 --> 01:50:22.100
at the start or when he wins, which is like,

01:50:22.100 --> 01:50:23.860
he's just put in there so that someone,

01:50:23.860 --> 01:50:25.460
they have a boss, I guess.

01:50:27.540 --> 01:50:30.180
And he uses the purple meteor as his arena,

01:50:31.060 --> 01:50:33.300
which is actually a palette swap of a blob stage.

01:50:34.260 --> 01:50:36.260
Although in Clay Fighter Tournament Edition,

01:50:36.260 --> 01:50:37.940
he has his own arena.

01:50:38.900 --> 01:50:44.500
His name is actually based on M. Bison and End Boss.

01:50:45.380 --> 01:50:47.300
So End Boss, yay.

01:50:48.580 --> 01:50:52.020
Anyway, the development, there's actually a really good,

01:50:52.020 --> 01:50:54.980
I think it's on Gaming Historian or one of those ones.

01:50:54.980 --> 01:50:56.100
Oh yeah, that's End Boss.

01:50:58.260 --> 01:51:00.260
I fast forwarded the clip since you were talking about it.

01:51:00.260 --> 01:51:00.760
Okay.

01:51:01.620 --> 01:51:04.900
But just talking about the game's development.

01:51:04.900 --> 01:51:08.340
So basically it was developed by Visual Concepts

01:51:08.340 --> 01:51:09.460
and published by Interplay.

01:51:10.340 --> 01:51:15.700
The president, Greg Thomas, said that they really just

01:51:15.700 --> 01:51:19.140
wanted something new and funny, you know,

01:51:19.140 --> 01:51:22.260
an alternative to all the violent fighting stuff.

01:51:22.820 --> 01:51:27.700
And so they looked to different animation experts,

01:51:27.700 --> 01:51:31.700
Ken Pontak, David Blyman of Danger Productions

01:51:31.700 --> 01:51:32.900
in Brisbane, California.

01:51:33.540 --> 01:51:37.060
And then they spent a year developing Clay Fighter.

01:51:38.180 --> 01:51:40.740
Once they had it, had the character's design,

01:51:40.740 --> 01:51:43.700
they molded the characters using different types of clay.

01:51:45.940 --> 01:51:49.860
Like Taffy was created with a stronger type than Blob.

01:51:49.860 --> 01:51:52.820
And they had all kinds of different models and everything.

01:51:52.820 --> 01:51:55.460
And then they animated them using stop motion animation.

01:51:56.340 --> 01:52:01.060
So basically it was a video camera linked to an Amiga computer

01:52:01.780 --> 01:52:06.020
that had a graphics editor that digitized the figures.

01:52:06.740 --> 01:52:12.260
And then they were saying that, you know,

01:52:12.820 --> 01:52:19.380
this part was like a big portion of the development

01:52:19.380 --> 01:52:22.660
to make it scriptable, you know,

01:52:22.660 --> 01:52:24.580
to use the scripting language for the animation

01:52:24.580 --> 01:52:26.500
and to digitize everything.

01:52:26.500 --> 01:52:27.780
It was very long and tedious.

01:52:28.420 --> 01:52:31.540
And Interplay added in a lot with Project

01:52:31.540 --> 01:52:33.780
by creating new character moves

01:52:33.780 --> 01:52:36.180
with different spliced animation sequences.

01:52:37.620 --> 01:52:40.260
They also recorded the musical score,

01:52:40.260 --> 01:52:41.620
the voices, the sound effects.

01:52:42.660 --> 01:52:45.780
And they said the design was originally supposed to compete

01:52:45.780 --> 01:52:47.940
with Mortal Kombat without the heavy violence.

01:52:49.780 --> 01:52:56.420
But Interplay pushed the game saying that parents,

01:52:57.140 --> 01:52:58.020
this is a quote here,

01:52:58.020 --> 01:52:59.780
parents who object to blood and guts games

01:52:59.780 --> 01:53:01.540
now have an alternative title

01:53:01.540 --> 01:53:04.100
that gives kids the kind of intense action

01:53:04.100 --> 01:53:06.500
they want to see in fighting games to make more sales.

01:53:07.300 --> 01:53:11.460
So in 94, we got Clay Fighter Tournament Edition

01:53:12.180 --> 01:53:13.780
that was exclusive.

01:53:13.780 --> 01:53:17.540
It was originally a rental, excuse me,

01:53:17.540 --> 01:53:18.580
through Blockbuster Video.

01:53:19.460 --> 01:53:20.900
And it improved on Clay Fighter.

01:53:20.900 --> 01:53:23.220
It fixed glitches, added different backgrounds,

01:53:23.220 --> 01:53:25.460
offered difficulty setting speeds versus mode.

01:53:27.220 --> 01:53:29.620
And then of course, when the Genesis version came out,

01:53:29.620 --> 01:53:31.780
which did not look nearly as good as the SNES ones,

01:53:33.060 --> 01:53:34.500
that's the version that actually made it

01:53:34.500 --> 01:53:36.100
on the Wii Virtual Console.

01:53:38.180 --> 01:53:41.780
There is a port of Clay Fighter for the Atari Jaguar

01:53:41.780 --> 01:53:43.860
that was in the works, but never released.

01:53:44.980 --> 01:53:46.500
So there were sequels,

01:53:46.500 --> 01:53:50.020
and I might even jump in and do one of these sequels later,

01:53:50.020 --> 01:53:51.220
but I'll give a brief rundown.

01:53:52.340 --> 01:53:55.460
The sequels were Clay Fighter II Judgment Clay,

01:53:55.540 --> 01:53:56.820
as in like Terminator 2.

01:53:58.420 --> 01:54:01.540
That was on SNES in 1995,

01:54:01.540 --> 01:54:05.540
and then Clay Fighter 63 1 3 for the Nintendo 64.

01:54:06.180 --> 01:54:07.700
And then it had a special edition

01:54:07.700 --> 01:54:10.980
called Clay Fighter Sculptor's Cut in 98,

01:54:10.980 --> 01:54:13.620
which was also only available as a rental

01:54:13.620 --> 01:54:16.100
at Blockbuster Video in North America.

01:54:16.100 --> 01:54:19.700
It had, it included four additional characters,

01:54:19.700 --> 01:54:23.140
High Five, Lady Liberty, Lockjaw A Pooch,

01:54:23.140 --> 01:54:24.740
and Zappa Yow Yow Boys.

01:54:26.420 --> 01:54:29.060
They were actually cut out of the original release

01:54:29.060 --> 01:54:30.500
for 63 1 3.

01:54:32.660 --> 01:54:34.820
And, you know, they changed some stuff up to it,

01:54:34.820 --> 01:54:37.940
but Sculptor's Cut is actually considered

01:54:37.940 --> 01:54:39.540
to be one of the rarest games released

01:54:39.540 --> 01:54:41.780
for the Nintendo 64.

01:54:41.780 --> 01:54:45.380
There were only 20,000 copies ever produced.

01:54:46.500 --> 01:54:48.980
In September 2009, Interplay announced

01:54:48.980 --> 01:54:51.620
a return of Clay Fighter for WiiWare in DSi,

01:54:51.620 --> 01:54:54.420
but then they were canceled, sorry, DSiWare.

01:54:55.300 --> 01:54:59.060
March 2015, Interplay revealed a remastered Clay Fighter

01:54:59.060 --> 01:55:01.060
was to be released in 2016,

01:55:01.860 --> 01:55:04.100
and had a partnership with Drip Drop Games.

01:55:04.100 --> 01:55:06.740
It was gonna have more than 20 characters

01:55:06.740 --> 01:55:09.540
and 20 familiar environments,

01:55:09.540 --> 01:55:12.980
Clay-alities, new mechanics like double jumping,

01:55:12.980 --> 01:55:14.740
air dashing, counters, and reversals.

01:55:14.740 --> 01:55:17.220
The game has been canceled and Interplay sold

01:55:17.220 --> 01:55:19.780
the intellectual rights of Clay Fighter

01:55:19.780 --> 01:55:21.140
and many of their titles.

01:55:21.140 --> 01:55:22.660
I don't think it says to whom.

01:55:23.620 --> 01:55:25.940
Anyway, Clay Fighter was awarded

01:55:25.940 --> 01:55:29.460
the Best Street Fighter Wannabe of 1993 by EGM,

01:55:29.460 --> 01:55:30.900
Electronic Games Monthly,

01:55:30.900 --> 01:55:33.060
and was awarded the best sound effects,

01:55:33.060 --> 01:55:34.660
and also for having the best ad.

01:55:36.660 --> 01:55:40.180
It sold 200,000 copies by the end of 94.

01:55:40.820 --> 01:55:43.700
Game Pro said that the Genesis port was pretty positive,

01:55:45.700 --> 01:55:49.060
but I think they were also saying

01:55:49.060 --> 01:55:51.060
that it just wasn't, it looked as good,

01:55:51.060 --> 01:55:55.060
although they thought that the six button Genesis controller

01:55:55.060 --> 01:55:58.180
made it the ideal version to play it on, you know?

01:55:59.460 --> 01:56:05.860
But at any rate, if we're gonna go into the rankings on things,

01:56:05.860 --> 01:56:11.460
I mean, it got kind of middle to positive reviews.

01:56:12.500 --> 01:56:14.900
Nintendo Power gave it a 15 out of 20.

01:56:17.460 --> 01:56:20.020
Video games and computer entertainment gave it 8 out of 10.

01:56:20.020 --> 01:56:21.860
Eurogamer gave it a 5 out of 10.

01:56:21.860 --> 01:56:25.540
EGM for SNES gave it a 30 of 40,

01:56:25.540 --> 01:56:27.860
and then Mega Drive a 6.6 out of 10.

01:56:27.860 --> 01:56:33.380
So yeah, it was, I mean, I'm gonna go on record saying,

01:56:33.380 --> 01:56:35.460
this is not the best fighting game.

01:56:35.460 --> 01:56:37.860
It really isn't, but it's fun.

01:56:38.420 --> 01:56:39.060
Yeah.

01:56:39.060 --> 01:56:40.660
And it's a lot of fun.

01:56:40.660 --> 01:56:44.260
The technology was really clever for its time too.

01:56:44.260 --> 01:56:46.500
You know, the whole concept of, you know,

01:56:46.500 --> 01:56:49.300
instead of capturing live actors like a Mortal Kombat,

01:56:49.380 --> 01:56:53.300
capturing claymation, I think was just a really fun idea.

01:56:53.300 --> 01:56:55.540
This game, you know, the fun that they were trying to do

01:56:55.540 --> 01:56:56.820
with this game really comes through,

01:56:56.820 --> 01:56:59.220
even if mechanically it's less fun.

01:57:00.260 --> 01:57:00.660
Yeah.

01:57:00.660 --> 01:57:04.500
And honestly, like, I totally wish that we would have

01:57:04.500 --> 01:57:06.180
another Clay Fighter game come out.

01:57:06.820 --> 01:57:09.780
Like, I would be so down for that,

01:57:09.780 --> 01:57:11.780
especially with our technology now.

01:57:11.780 --> 01:57:12.580
I don't disagree.

01:57:13.380 --> 01:57:18.900
Like, I mean, they could do the whole thing CG, you know?

01:57:20.260 --> 01:57:22.500
But, you know, have like really good clay

01:57:24.180 --> 01:57:25.540
textures applied to it.

01:57:25.540 --> 01:57:26.040
Yeah.

01:57:26.500 --> 01:57:30.020
I mean, it would, if you were gonna do like

01:57:30.020 --> 01:57:33.620
a stop motion animation character game right now,

01:57:34.740 --> 01:57:38.260
to have it work for our modern sets,

01:57:39.220 --> 01:57:44.660
you would have to do so many in-betweens, right?

01:57:44.660 --> 01:57:45.300
Sure.

01:57:45.300 --> 01:57:49.380
To have it fit like a 60 FPS frame rate, for example.

01:57:50.340 --> 01:57:55.220
So that would mean, like, for every second of motion,

01:57:55.220 --> 01:57:58.980
you would have 60 different animated frames.

01:58:00.020 --> 01:58:02.980
And I'll do that by however much.

01:58:02.980 --> 01:58:03.480
Yeah.

01:58:04.740 --> 01:58:08.500
But yeah, and I think it's time to bring back

01:58:08.500 --> 01:58:10.740
these characters and give them love.

01:58:11.940 --> 01:58:14.260
I want to know who has the license now, though.

01:58:14.340 --> 01:58:15.940
I'd have to look it up and I'm too lazy.

01:58:16.500 --> 01:58:18.180
So yeah, Clay Fighter.

01:58:18.900 --> 01:58:19.400
All right.

01:58:20.580 --> 01:58:21.540
Clay Fighter.

01:58:21.540 --> 01:58:22.500
Clay, Clay Fighter.

01:58:22.500 --> 01:58:22.820
Good.

01:58:22.820 --> 01:58:23.620
I just always liked it.

01:58:23.620 --> 01:58:25.220
Like, it felt like the music would stop

01:58:25.220 --> 01:58:28.820
and then the singer would go and then keep going.

01:58:28.820 --> 01:58:31.780
If nothing else, we just need a bitchin' new theme song

01:58:31.780 --> 01:58:32.500
from the team.

01:58:32.500 --> 01:58:33.220
That's what we need.

01:58:33.860 --> 01:58:36.820
Yeah, but it's still all about that, Mr. Frosty.

01:58:36.820 --> 01:58:37.460
All right.

01:58:37.460 --> 01:58:40.020
Classic game of the week, Clay Fighter.

01:58:40.020 --> 01:58:40.900
Good pick.

01:58:40.900 --> 01:58:41.400
All right.

01:58:42.100 --> 01:58:43.780
We're about two hours in and I know we have

01:58:43.780 --> 01:58:45.300
some long emails tonight, so I want to make sure

01:58:45.300 --> 01:58:46.100
we get to those.

01:58:46.100 --> 01:58:46.740
We do?

01:58:46.740 --> 01:58:48.740
Yeah, we have two that I saw.

01:58:48.740 --> 01:58:52.500
So before we get there, we will get through the rest

01:58:52.500 --> 01:58:52.900
of the news.

01:58:52.900 --> 01:58:54.420
So let's just keep it moving.

01:58:54.420 --> 01:58:56.740
We're going to go to rapid fire news and rapidly talk

01:58:56.740 --> 01:58:57.300
about some news.

01:58:57.300 --> 01:58:57.800
Loki.

01:58:58.340 --> 01:58:58.660
Yes.

01:58:58.660 --> 01:59:02.100
So this is cool if you're looking to get into some VR,

01:59:02.100 --> 01:59:03.620
but don't want to spend as much money.

01:59:04.260 --> 01:59:07.300
The meta quest is dropping in price, or at least

01:59:07.300 --> 01:59:08.340
the meta quest two.

01:59:08.340 --> 01:59:12.180
So they've confirmed that they're dropping the 256 gigabyte

01:59:12.180 --> 01:59:16.820
model down from $499 to $429.

01:59:16.820 --> 01:59:19.140
And I think that's supposed to be a permanent price drop.

01:59:19.140 --> 01:59:23.220
Also, the Quest Pro, which was super expensive for what

01:59:23.220 --> 01:59:27.700
you got, $1,500 is now dropping down to only $1,000.

01:59:28.420 --> 01:59:30.260
So something.

01:59:30.260 --> 01:59:31.780
And that took effect today.

01:59:32.660 --> 01:59:35.700
So if you're in the United States or Canada, you can enjoy

01:59:35.700 --> 01:59:38.340
those lower prices or just wait for them to announce the

01:59:38.340 --> 01:59:39.780
quest three, because that's probably why they dropped

01:59:39.780 --> 01:59:40.740
the price in the first place.

01:59:42.180 --> 01:59:45.940
Speaking of lower prices for consoles, if you are a Verizon

01:59:45.940 --> 01:59:51.300
customer, you have until April 30th to pick up an Xbox Series

01:59:51.300 --> 01:59:53.300
S for only $150.

01:59:54.180 --> 01:59:55.940
It's half off its retail price.

01:59:55.940 --> 02:00:00.100
If you're a Verizon customer, I am.

02:00:00.100 --> 02:00:03.460
But I already have a Series X, so that's no good for me.

02:00:03.460 --> 02:00:05.700
Still a Series S together with Game Pass.

02:00:05.700 --> 02:00:08.180
Pretty good way to get your foot in the door with current

02:00:08.180 --> 02:00:08.680
gaming.

02:00:09.220 --> 02:00:09.720
For sure.

02:00:10.680 --> 02:00:12.440
Dark Zagre, you have a quick story for us.

02:00:14.120 --> 02:00:14.620
I do.

02:00:15.240 --> 02:00:19.480
And actually, I've watched a lot of gameplay because Jack

02:00:19.480 --> 02:00:24.440
Danger has one of these or had one of these on his Twitch

02:00:24.440 --> 02:00:26.440
channel, because of course he does.

02:00:27.720 --> 02:00:28.920
Foo Fighters Pinball.

02:00:29.880 --> 02:00:32.840
And Dan and I were talking about this while we were watching

02:00:32.840 --> 02:00:37.080
you play it, that, oh, it's kind of weird.

02:00:37.080 --> 02:00:38.040
It's kind of niche.

02:00:38.040 --> 02:00:41.080
But then we saw it in play, and it looks really freaking

02:00:41.080 --> 02:00:41.580
fun.

02:00:43.080 --> 02:00:45.880
They, Stern did release a trailer about it.

02:00:45.880 --> 02:00:49.480
They didn't actually show anything of the actual game, but

02:00:49.480 --> 02:00:54.840
it has different custom drawn animation, including like

02:00:54.840 --> 02:00:55.340
this.

02:00:56.760 --> 02:00:59.800
The article describes it as a Ghostbusters cartoon vibe.

02:00:59.800 --> 02:01:05.080
I think of it almost more a little bit like a combination

02:01:05.080 --> 02:01:06.760
of Scooby Doo and Ghostbusters.

02:01:08.680 --> 02:01:09.720
Yep, exactly.

02:01:09.720 --> 02:01:12.760
As Bobby said it, he was the designer of the game.

02:01:14.120 --> 02:01:16.680
But I mean, it's really fun.

02:01:16.680 --> 02:01:21.560
And of course, it's got their music in the game.

02:01:22.440 --> 02:01:24.600
And everybody.

02:01:24.600 --> 02:01:28.280
So right now it has, of course, Dave Grohl, Chris Shifflett

02:01:28.280 --> 02:01:32.840
and Pat Smear, Nate Mendel, Rami Jaffee, and their late

02:01:32.840 --> 02:01:40.440
drummer Taylor Hawkins are all in the movies in the game.

02:01:40.440 --> 02:01:43.560
I'm glad they were able to get Taylor in the game after all.

02:01:43.560 --> 02:01:44.060
Yeah.

02:01:45.720 --> 02:01:48.200
But it's just a trip.

02:01:48.200 --> 02:01:53.080
I mean, it really is like just it looks like super, super

02:01:53.080 --> 02:01:53.580
fun.

02:01:54.520 --> 02:01:57.800
SSJ100 Matt says all the Gen X fans are becoming tables,

02:01:57.800 --> 02:01:59.240
and I don't hate it, right?

02:01:59.240 --> 02:02:01.160
Where's my nine inch nails pinball table?

02:02:03.160 --> 02:02:03.880
I love that.

02:02:05.400 --> 02:02:07.880
I mean, I'll be honest.

02:02:07.880 --> 02:02:11.240
I would want this over some of the ones that we have.

02:02:12.360 --> 02:02:14.760
I'm pretty sure we will never have a Depeche Mode pinball.

02:02:14.760 --> 02:02:16.360
I'm just going to say that right now.

02:02:16.360 --> 02:02:19.080
We would have nine inch nails before we had Cure in Depeche Mode.

02:02:21.080 --> 02:02:21.640
I don't know.

02:02:22.360 --> 02:02:24.280
A Cure pinball table would be kind of.

02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:27.800
I don't think Robert Smith would go for that.

02:02:28.520 --> 02:02:29.080
You never know.

02:02:29.480 --> 02:02:32.760
But I'm very sure Depeche Mode would not.

02:02:34.280 --> 02:02:34.780
Probably not.

02:02:35.320 --> 02:02:39.560
Yeah, but at any rate, at any rate, though, it just looks like so much fun.

02:02:39.560 --> 02:02:40.920
I love the art style.

02:02:41.480 --> 02:02:42.520
So, yeah.

02:02:42.520 --> 02:02:43.020
Yeah.

02:02:44.600 --> 02:02:46.840
What's Jack Danger's pinball channel again?

02:02:46.840 --> 02:02:48.040
I just know it's him.

02:02:51.320 --> 02:02:53.560
But if you dead flip, that's it.

02:02:53.560 --> 02:02:54.060
Dead flip.

02:02:54.860 --> 02:02:59.260
If you go back, like, I think it was either yesterday or the day before,

02:02:59.260 --> 02:03:04.940
but go back on Dead Flip's Twitch and you can see some footage of the game.

02:03:07.100 --> 02:03:07.340
All right.

02:03:07.340 --> 02:03:12.380
Well, real quick, I'm just going to mention that Splatoon 3 got a 3.0 update.

02:03:12.380 --> 02:03:18.460
It just launched this past week, and most of it is to support the additional DLC that's incoming,

02:03:18.460 --> 02:03:24.300
the Inkopolis DLC, which again, still makes no sense to me why this is an interesting thing at

02:03:24.300 --> 02:03:28.540
all, but it's there and allows you to travel between the old town and the new town.

02:03:28.540 --> 02:03:29.020
Cool.

02:03:29.020 --> 02:03:31.900
I guess it's all the same shit.

02:03:31.900 --> 02:03:33.980
It's weird, but okay.

02:03:33.980 --> 02:03:36.620
But there were other things that they're being added.

02:03:36.620 --> 02:03:43.340
Things about fresh season 2023 with a new catalog, new gear, a new gear brand, 126 new items,

02:03:43.340 --> 02:03:45.740
two new battle stages, two new special weapons.

02:03:45.740 --> 02:03:46.780
You get where I'm going with this.

02:03:46.780 --> 02:03:51.500
There is a lot of other new stuff that's being launched with the fresh season 2023 that's coming

02:03:51.500 --> 02:03:52.140
as well.

02:03:52.140 --> 02:03:53.740
It gets really into the weeds.

02:03:53.740 --> 02:03:57.980
I don't have time during rapid fire to talk about some of these intricate changes to

02:03:57.980 --> 02:04:02.860
multiplayers, like what are some of the special weapons they have and some of the new weapons

02:04:02.860 --> 02:04:03.980
coming into shops.

02:04:03.980 --> 02:04:08.620
But for folks that are playing the game, I'm sure there's a lot of cool stuff here.

02:04:08.620 --> 02:04:13.020
I noticed this interesting note, changes to connectivity made it so that players will

02:04:13.020 --> 02:04:14.940
be notified when their connection is unstable.

02:04:14.940 --> 02:04:19.580
If the connection continues to be unstable, player controls will temporarily be disabled.

02:04:19.580 --> 02:04:21.100
That's very interesting.

02:04:21.100 --> 02:04:24.540
So yeah, also some Splatfest changes.

02:04:24.540 --> 02:04:31.340
Basically, it looks like they're kind of make a changing Splatfest TXP across the board

02:04:32.140 --> 02:04:36.220
to 7500 each stage as opposed to this incrementing thing.

02:04:36.220 --> 02:04:37.660
So it's kind of interesting.

02:04:37.660 --> 02:04:41.420
So check it out if you're a Splatoon fan and I'm still with that.

02:04:42.140 --> 02:04:45.740
That all being said, let's travel around the world and check out some games you can check

02:04:45.740 --> 02:04:48.460
out this week as they release starting with the US.

02:04:48.460 --> 02:04:48.860
Loki.

02:04:49.900 --> 02:04:53.340
Yes, so what a great one to start with.

02:04:53.340 --> 02:05:01.020
We have Romansylvania on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox series.

02:05:02.300 --> 02:05:08.300
Caverns of Mars Recharged on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox

02:05:08.380 --> 02:05:09.900
1, and Xbox series.

02:05:10.780 --> 02:05:17.820
Clash Artifacts of Chaos on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox 1, and Xbox series.

02:05:18.540 --> 02:05:22.140
Fatal Frame Mask of the Lunar Eclipse.

02:05:22.140 --> 02:05:28.700
That's on a PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox 1, and Xbox series.

02:05:30.140 --> 02:05:33.260
Looks like Ib on Nintendo Switch.

02:05:34.060 --> 02:05:39.340
Oni Road to Be the Mightiest Oni on Nintendo Switch.

02:05:41.900 --> 02:05:49.660
Paranormal Sight, The Seven Mysteries of Honjo on Nintendo Switch, iOS, and Android.

02:05:50.780 --> 02:05:57.340
We have Ray's Arcade Chronology on Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4.

02:05:58.140 --> 02:06:01.820
Oh, so that's, I guess, based off the Ray Force series.

02:06:02.780 --> 02:06:12.620
And then looks like Mato Anomalies on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5,

02:06:12.620 --> 02:06:14.780
Xbox 1, and Xbox series.

02:06:14.780 --> 02:06:15.820
And that is it.

02:06:16.540 --> 02:06:19.740
All right, traveling to Japan, it's actually a lot of the same stuff, so I'll try to move

02:06:19.740 --> 02:06:20.460
through this quickly.

02:06:20.460 --> 02:06:26.620
On the Nintendo Switch, we have Ray's Arcade Chronology in a regular and limited edition.

02:06:27.180 --> 02:06:28.540
And I'm trying to see what games are in that.

02:06:28.540 --> 02:06:30.860
Oh, it's Ray Force, Ray Storm, Ray Crisis.

02:06:30.860 --> 02:06:31.900
That's why they call it Ray's.

02:06:33.020 --> 02:06:34.620
This is such a good series.

02:06:34.620 --> 02:06:36.620
Yeah, so that's coming out on the Switch this week.

02:06:37.260 --> 02:06:41.260
And then we also have Melon Journey, Bittersweet Memories, Fatal Frame, Mask of the Lunar

02:06:41.260 --> 02:06:48.700
Eclipse, Record of, excuse me, that's only a US, Ib is also out in Japan this week, as

02:06:48.700 --> 02:06:52.620
well as that Oni Road to Be the Mightiest Oni, that's out in Japan as well.

02:06:53.580 --> 02:06:56.460
And Chef Life, a restaurant simulator.

02:06:57.100 --> 02:06:59.420
Yes, that is out as well in Japan this week.

02:06:59.420 --> 02:07:03.100
Checking out the PlayStation 5, some crossovers as well.

02:07:03.100 --> 02:07:06.780
You still have that Oni Road to Be the Mightiest Oni is out there as well.

02:07:06.780 --> 02:07:11.340
And the Melon Journey, Bittersweet Memories, those are crossing over to the PlayStation

02:07:11.340 --> 02:07:12.460
5 this week.

02:07:12.460 --> 02:07:14.060
But otherwise, that is it.

02:07:14.060 --> 02:07:15.420
How about the UK, Dark Sakura?

02:07:16.780 --> 02:07:18.140
Just a handful of things.

02:07:18.780 --> 02:07:22.380
It looks like we get Train Life, a railway simulator for Switch.

02:07:24.140 --> 02:07:29.900
Also on the ninth, we get for PlayStation and Xbox, Monster Energy Supercross 6.

02:07:30.540 --> 02:07:32.620
For Switch, we get Session Skatesim.

02:07:33.420 --> 02:07:40.460
On the 10th, we get for the big three, we get DC Justice League, Cosmic Chaos.

02:07:41.020 --> 02:07:43.660
PlayStation and Switch, we get My Life Pet Vet.

02:07:44.460 --> 02:07:47.820
Also on the two, we get Crazy Chicken Traps and Treasures.

02:07:49.100 --> 02:07:51.260
On PlayStation, we get Game Deck.

02:07:52.300 --> 02:07:55.820
And then on the big three, we get Mato anomalies.

02:07:57.260 --> 02:07:57.760
All right.

02:07:58.780 --> 02:08:00.700
Let's do some more stories here.

02:08:00.700 --> 02:08:03.980
And I'm going to be honest, I'm starting to get a little tired as we're moving on.

02:08:03.980 --> 02:08:06.780
I think that's just me being exhausted from everything last week.

02:08:06.780 --> 02:08:10.860
So I'm maybe fighting off whatever Alan has probably passed on.

02:08:11.260 --> 02:08:19.420
So let's move through these stories and wrap up the show.

02:08:19.420 --> 02:08:21.740
So let's get to this from Loki.

02:08:22.700 --> 02:08:23.200
Yes.

02:08:23.200 --> 02:08:33.340
So we have a new number one subscribed Twitch star, I guess if you will, Kai Sennett.

02:08:33.340 --> 02:08:43.580
He is a 21-year-old African-American Twitch streamer who has now beat Ludwig as the most

02:08:43.580 --> 02:08:49.660
subscribed Twitch, I guess, streamer.

02:08:49.660 --> 02:08:55.580
And he, I guess what's notable, I guess they said because he did that the last week of

02:08:55.580 --> 02:08:57.740
February is a Black History Month type of thing.

02:08:57.740 --> 02:09:03.100
I guess it's a nice coincidence, but it's cool to see, though, more rising stars kind

02:09:03.100 --> 02:09:04.700
of coming through the whole Twitch scene.

02:09:04.700 --> 02:09:10.380
He streams a lot of, I guess, Fortnite, Grand Theft Auto 5, NBA 2K, 23, and that type of

02:09:10.380 --> 02:09:10.880
stuff.

02:09:11.340 --> 02:09:14.780
Plus that collabs with a lot of different hip hop artists as well.

02:09:16.540 --> 02:09:17.900
Well, congratulations.

02:09:17.900 --> 02:09:18.400
Good.

02:09:18.700 --> 02:09:19.980
All right, DarkSakura.

02:09:19.980 --> 02:09:34.300
So Sega has put out a survey asking for opinions on a certain number of games.

02:09:35.180 --> 02:09:40.620
So the ones that have been on the list, there's actually a few.

02:09:40.620 --> 02:09:49.580
We have Judgment, Golden Axe, Streets of Rage, Shinobi, Crazy Taxi, Jet Set Radio,

02:09:50.860 --> 02:09:54.380
Altered Beast, House of the Dead, and Virtua Fighter.

02:09:54.380 --> 02:09:58.620
And basically it's like, you know, you get three options.

02:09:58.620 --> 02:10:01.740
Never heard of it, heard of it, but never played it or played a game from it.

02:10:03.420 --> 02:10:09.900
So I think that they're trying to garner who knows these IPs and who would be likely to

02:10:09.980 --> 02:10:10.480
play it.

02:10:11.180 --> 02:10:19.580
So, I mean, Bloomberg did report that Sega, this is actually last April, that Sega was

02:10:19.580 --> 02:10:25.020
investing in their back catalog, working on reboots for Crazy Taxi and Jet Set Radio.

02:10:26.380 --> 02:10:27.900
So who knows?

02:10:28.460 --> 02:10:30.940
And of course we have the Samba game got recently announced.

02:10:30.940 --> 02:10:35.420
So this isn't completely, completely, completely a surprise that Sega is dipping back in this

02:10:35.420 --> 02:10:37.900
Dreamcast Classics catalog, but good.

02:10:38.700 --> 02:10:39.980
I want them to bring knights.

02:10:42.220 --> 02:10:43.660
Why do we not have any more knights?

02:10:43.660 --> 02:10:44.380
We need more knights.

02:10:45.020 --> 02:10:46.300
We need to go get on that survey.

02:10:47.420 --> 02:10:48.540
We got Balan Wonderworld.

02:10:48.540 --> 02:10:50.300
I mean, that's basically the same thing, right?

02:10:50.300 --> 02:10:51.100
Stop.

02:10:51.100 --> 02:10:51.600
All right.

02:10:53.260 --> 02:10:53.740
All right.

02:10:53.740 --> 02:10:54.700
Let's move on.

02:10:54.700 --> 02:10:55.200
Loki.

02:10:57.100 --> 02:10:57.600
Okay.

02:10:57.900 --> 02:11:01.180
Well, this is a pretty cool deal as well.

02:11:01.180 --> 02:11:04.860
So there's a brand new Humble Bundle and oh my God, we ever talk about Humble Bundle.

02:11:04.860 --> 02:11:06.380
That hasn't happened in years.

02:11:08.060 --> 02:11:16.780
They have 72 games for 30, or at least as little as $30 as part of a Syria Turkey Relief

02:11:16.780 --> 02:11:17.580
Bundle.

02:11:17.580 --> 02:11:20.140
And there's lots of big games in there as well.

02:11:20.780 --> 02:11:27.740
So we've got such things as like Gotham Knights, Ghostrunner, System Shock 2, XCOM 2,

02:11:27.740 --> 02:11:33.820
Payday 2, Mountain Blade, Warband, lots of different games in there.

02:11:33.820 --> 02:11:39.340
I definitely picked it up because, you know, got to add to my number of games I don't play.

02:11:41.340 --> 02:11:42.380
Too true.

02:11:42.380 --> 02:11:44.700
But Gotham Knights being in this bundle.

02:11:44.700 --> 02:11:47.660
I mean, that game is like not even six months old.

02:11:47.660 --> 02:11:48.380
My goodness.

02:11:48.380 --> 02:11:49.740
No, it's very recent.

02:11:50.460 --> 02:11:53.100
Yeah, lots and lots of things to check out in there.

02:11:53.100 --> 02:11:57.340
Yeah, there's a lot in this, but it looks like they've raised as of right now, two and

02:11:57.340 --> 02:11:58.300
a half million and counting.

02:11:58.860 --> 02:11:59.740
So nice for them.

02:11:59.740 --> 02:12:03.020
All right.

02:12:03.020 --> 02:12:04.700
And one more story for you.

02:12:06.060 --> 02:12:11.420
Who doesn't love the classic game Zero Wing and the earliest earliest of internet memes,

02:12:12.060 --> 02:12:16.780
including Move Every Zig and All Your Base Are Belong to Us, of course.

02:12:17.660 --> 02:12:19.020
This is interesting, though.

02:12:19.020 --> 02:12:26.220
So Topland has, you know, Topland publisher Bitwave.

02:12:26.220 --> 02:12:27.100
Toaplan.

02:12:27.100 --> 02:12:27.900
Toaplan, excuse me.

02:12:27.900 --> 02:12:29.180
I always say Toaplan.

02:12:29.260 --> 02:12:36.220
Toaplan is the publisher Bitwave is going to be doing an update for this collection.

02:12:36.220 --> 02:12:42.940
It has changes and fixes, and they're adding the introduction sequence for the arcade version

02:12:42.940 --> 02:12:47.820
of Zero Wing because it didn't exist in the original version.

02:12:47.820 --> 02:12:50.140
It was in the Mega Drive port.

02:12:50.140 --> 02:12:53.820
There was no introduction in the original coin op edition.

02:12:53.820 --> 02:12:59.980
So now there is a brand new introduction with new hand drawn artwork that is available.

02:12:59.980 --> 02:13:03.260
They're also trying to target some of the other things that have been noticed by hardcore

02:13:03.260 --> 02:13:07.900
fans, you know, basically, you know, some of the little control issues and things of

02:13:07.900 --> 02:13:08.700
that sort.

02:13:08.700 --> 02:13:11.100
I just want to see really quickly if I can bring it up here.

02:13:12.140 --> 02:13:13.100
What this might look like.

02:13:13.100 --> 02:13:19.420
Oh, my gosh, this is it really is pretty similar to what you had before.

02:13:20.060 --> 02:13:25.180
And it's even I'm turning on the music a little bit.

02:13:25.900 --> 02:13:27.660
We are getting a signal on screen.

02:13:29.500 --> 02:13:31.100
Main screen turned on.

02:13:31.100 --> 02:13:35.740
Yeah, it's pretty much what you remember.

02:13:35.740 --> 02:13:38.300
But just with that right.

02:13:38.300 --> 02:13:39.420
How are you gentlemen?

02:13:41.020 --> 02:13:45.100
Is that art style that you would your base are belong to us?

02:13:45.100 --> 02:13:45.500
Perfect.

02:13:45.500 --> 02:13:46.380
We'll end on that note.

02:13:46.380 --> 02:13:54.620
Um, it is what an arcade machine of that era might look like, to be honest.

02:13:56.540 --> 02:13:57.100
It's great.

02:13:58.380 --> 02:14:02.060
I'm glad that they went back and added that just for that effect.

02:14:02.060 --> 02:14:02.780
It's amazing.

02:14:03.500 --> 02:14:07.180
And of course, of course, they kept the line as is, of course they did.

02:14:07.180 --> 02:14:12.140
That would be like, okay, can you imagine they've re translated Final Fantasy four,

02:14:12.140 --> 02:14:15.660
I don't know how many times they are not allowed to get rid of the line.

02:14:15.660 --> 02:14:17.020
You spoonie bard.

02:14:17.020 --> 02:14:17.580
Guess what?

02:14:17.580 --> 02:14:20.620
In Japanese, he did not say you spoonie bard.

02:14:20.620 --> 02:14:23.260
That was a silly translation of that era.

02:14:23.820 --> 02:14:25.980
They did like the equivalent of you son of a bitch.

02:14:26.860 --> 02:14:28.060
Basically, it's you asshole.

02:14:28.060 --> 02:14:29.180
Yeah, you jerk.

02:14:29.180 --> 02:14:33.660
But obviously, to make it family friendly, some liberties were taken by the translator

02:14:33.660 --> 02:14:35.660
and it became you spoonie bard.

02:14:35.660 --> 02:14:40.940
And now your spoonie belongs to us.

02:14:40.940 --> 02:14:41.580
I can't.

02:14:43.900 --> 02:14:45.340
All right, you know what?

02:14:45.420 --> 02:14:46.460
I'm officially done.

02:14:46.460 --> 02:14:47.820
Let's go to the mailbag.

02:14:47.820 --> 02:14:49.500
Every week we invite your emails.

02:14:50.060 --> 02:14:52.940
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

02:14:52.940 --> 02:14:53.580
Who said that?

02:14:53.580 --> 02:14:54.540
I was even looking at chat.

02:14:54.540 --> 02:14:55.420
Who said that?

02:14:55.420 --> 02:14:55.980
Fifth Dream.

02:14:56.780 --> 02:14:57.740
Fifth Dream.

02:14:57.740 --> 02:14:58.460
Gold Star.

02:14:58.460 --> 02:14:59.020
Gold Star.

02:14:59.020 --> 02:15:00.140
All right, wait a second.

02:15:00.140 --> 02:15:04.300
I have to explain something to SSJ100Matt about I am error.

02:15:05.820 --> 02:15:09.180
There was another character who was named Bagu.

02:15:10.380 --> 02:15:10.700
Bug.

02:15:12.060 --> 02:15:13.100
Error and bug.

02:15:15.980 --> 02:15:17.420
Cute.

02:15:17.420 --> 02:15:20.380
The name was not a mistranslation.

02:15:21.900 --> 02:15:30.220
Bagu was more like a direct romanization of how bug would be pronounced, you know, in

02:15:30.220 --> 02:15:31.420
Japanese, I guess.

02:15:32.380 --> 02:15:35.020
So no, they were error and bug.

02:15:35.820 --> 02:15:37.500
Well, how about you know what?

02:15:37.500 --> 02:15:41.180
Why don't we get Bagu an error in a future Zelda game?

02:15:41.180 --> 02:15:42.780
Whatever happened to those two?

02:15:42.780 --> 02:15:43.740
That's what I want to know.

02:15:44.140 --> 02:15:45.740
Maybe we'll find out in Tears of the Kingdom.

02:15:45.740 --> 02:15:46.460
Do you know Bagu?

02:15:48.540 --> 02:15:49.100
I do.

02:15:49.100 --> 02:15:50.380
I do know the Bagu.

02:15:50.380 --> 02:15:52.300
No, he was the bridge guy, wasn't he?

02:15:52.300 --> 02:15:52.800
Yeah.

02:15:54.540 --> 02:15:56.700
I know my classics once in a while.

02:15:57.420 --> 02:15:57.920
Yeah.

02:15:58.860 --> 02:15:59.420
Anywho.

02:15:59.420 --> 02:16:06.060
Especially that one because I actually beat that one as a kid and beating Zelda 2 is one

02:16:06.060 --> 02:16:08.140
of those like Gold Star gamer achievement.

02:16:08.140 --> 02:16:09.180
I actually beat that one.

02:16:09.180 --> 02:16:10.300
It wasn't easy, but I did it.

02:16:10.300 --> 02:16:11.580
Okay, beat the guardian legend.

02:16:13.740 --> 02:16:14.240
I'll try.

02:16:18.700 --> 02:16:19.340
Oh, yeah.

02:16:19.340 --> 02:16:21.900
No, Gwen brought up like my favorite line.

02:16:22.460 --> 02:16:28.060
Sit your ass down in your chair and drink your goddamn tea from Sid.

02:16:28.060 --> 02:16:29.180
This tea is delicious.

02:16:30.860 --> 02:16:33.980
That I have that line perfectly memorized.

02:16:33.980 --> 02:16:34.460
I love it.

02:16:34.460 --> 02:16:35.580
Okay, so email.

02:16:35.580 --> 02:16:38.620
Participate at orangeandrea.com.

02:16:38.620 --> 02:16:39.420
All right.

02:16:39.420 --> 02:16:41.420
First one comes from Ranchan.

02:16:41.420 --> 02:16:43.980
There were some very interesting things that were discussed.

02:16:43.980 --> 02:16:46.540
I'd like to take a few minutes to discuss if you don't mind.

02:16:46.540 --> 02:16:48.140
Number one, working from home.

02:16:48.140 --> 02:16:50.620
I know this is a hotly discussed topic outside of gaming.

02:16:50.620 --> 02:16:54.300
I do remember reading that the team behind Tiny Tina's Wonderlands would have been longer

02:16:54.300 --> 02:16:57.500
if the team wasn't remote, which to me does make sense.

02:16:57.500 --> 02:16:59.740
I do understand that not every job can be remote.

02:16:59.740 --> 02:17:01.420
Mine can be hybrid, but it's on site.

02:17:01.420 --> 02:17:02.860
I like going to work in my office.

02:17:02.860 --> 02:17:08.220
You're required to be on site unless the role you have is coded for remote.

02:17:09.100 --> 02:17:11.820
And if you're on site, you must be fully vaccinated and boosted.

02:17:11.820 --> 02:17:13.100
I will say this, though.

02:17:13.100 --> 02:17:17.580
During the beginning of the pandemic, a famous talent agency required everyone to come into

02:17:17.580 --> 02:17:20.300
the office and they lost a lot of good people.

02:17:20.300 --> 02:17:26.140
Now, the talent agency I worked for moved and everyone moved everyone to laptops and

02:17:26.140 --> 02:17:29.900
sent people home for the majority of the period.

02:17:29.900 --> 02:17:35.340
And now we just expanded one of our floors because oddly enough, more people want to

02:17:35.340 --> 02:17:36.620
come into the office right now.

02:17:36.620 --> 02:17:41.980
We're not at full capacity, but you can see the camaraderie among the associates on the

02:17:41.980 --> 02:17:45.340
floor, something you don't you can't really get when working from home.

02:17:46.780 --> 02:17:47.280
OK.

02:17:49.260 --> 02:17:52.220
Yeah, I mean, some people prefer me.

02:17:52.860 --> 02:18:00.220
My job can be done just as efficiently at the office or at home because of what I do.

02:18:01.420 --> 02:18:05.500
But it does make it hard for something that should be a collaborative effort.

02:18:06.380 --> 02:18:08.140
So, yeah, I mean, I get it.

02:18:09.340 --> 02:18:09.840
Well said.

02:18:11.020 --> 02:18:14.860
It's just the opposite for me, because if I go into the office and they'll see how annoyed

02:18:14.860 --> 02:18:19.020
at the other people I am, it's best that they don't see me in the office.

02:18:20.140 --> 02:18:24.220
I'm just glad that I face inward toward my computer.

02:18:24.220 --> 02:18:27.980
When you face your computer, no one can see you eye roll, although they can hear it.

02:18:27.980 --> 02:18:32.620
My job, I work with offices up and down the state, so I would be kind of like remote.

02:18:32.620 --> 02:18:36.700
My team is up and down the state, too, so I would be kind of remote working anyway.

02:18:36.700 --> 02:18:39.980
So it's an interesting kind of predicament I'm in.

02:18:39.980 --> 02:18:44.220
The interesting change is that I don't and all of us don't travel.

02:18:44.220 --> 02:18:48.300
Like back in the day, I probably would have flown down to Southern California once every

02:18:48.300 --> 02:18:52.540
few months to see the team there and that's off the table.

02:18:52.540 --> 02:18:54.780
So we have to connect on Zoom and do other things.

02:18:54.780 --> 02:19:00.140
But I think a lot of companies are still trying to find their rhythm with all of that.

02:19:00.700 --> 02:19:03.980
What does this, using my quotey fingers, new normal look like?

02:19:03.980 --> 02:19:09.980
Because number one, obviously, COVID and the pandemic, it's still a thing whether society's

02:19:09.980 --> 02:19:10.700
over it or not.

02:19:11.340 --> 02:19:18.140
Whether they declare it endemic status or whatever, the reality is people's perception

02:19:18.140 --> 02:19:23.900
of what work can be and the fact that people know full damn well they can do their jobs

02:19:23.900 --> 02:19:26.940
at home have really changed the game.

02:19:26.940 --> 02:19:30.860
People that are looking for jobs are looking for jobs that they can do remotely.

02:19:30.860 --> 02:19:32.540
It's interesting.

02:19:33.580 --> 02:19:39.740
I will say there's been some good things for going back into the office and the fact

02:19:39.740 --> 02:19:44.140
that it's actually improved my ability to go out and be around people.

02:19:45.660 --> 02:19:50.940
I feel like as I'm adjusting more to being around people, some of my social anxiety has

02:19:50.940 --> 02:19:51.900
certainly decreased.

02:19:52.780 --> 02:19:56.300
But I'm also a, if it fucks me up, face it kind of person.

02:19:57.740 --> 02:20:00.460
And it's been really good because I'm friends.

02:20:01.180 --> 02:20:01.900
I work with Drew.

02:20:06.460 --> 02:20:10.140
My work buddies are like my other family, sort of.

02:20:11.340 --> 02:20:13.020
So I like going in and seeing them.

02:20:13.020 --> 02:20:14.780
I certainly love going to the cafeteria.

02:20:15.740 --> 02:20:23.500
Also, right now, Melody is sort of one of my co-workers, but in the big office.

02:20:24.940 --> 02:20:26.540
So we chat at work.

02:20:29.020 --> 02:20:29.820
So the next part.

02:20:30.780 --> 02:20:32.300
The game that is not mentioned.

02:20:32.300 --> 02:20:32.860
Oh shit.

02:20:33.980 --> 02:20:38.140
Now I know this game has caused a lot of controversy and yes, Rob, the boycotting on this game

02:20:38.140 --> 02:20:39.420
did indeed backfire.

02:20:39.420 --> 02:20:41.180
I have no desire to play this game.

02:20:41.180 --> 02:20:42.460
I know people who do.

02:20:42.460 --> 02:20:46.540
They can separate the art from the artist and that's them, but I will not berate someone

02:20:46.540 --> 02:20:47.500
for playing it.

02:20:47.500 --> 02:20:50.300
That falls under the rule of fuck around and find out.

02:20:50.300 --> 02:20:55.500
I won't go into any further on my thoughts on the game because the three of you said

02:20:55.500 --> 02:20:55.980
it already.

02:20:55.980 --> 02:20:58.380
Y'all said it in a way that I could not, and I thank you for it.

02:20:59.260 --> 02:21:03.820
And as for Jamie going beyond this and talking about how to help and support marginalized

02:21:03.820 --> 02:21:05.820
people, I could give you a great big hug.

02:21:05.820 --> 02:21:07.100
Oh, you make me feel good.

02:21:07.100 --> 02:21:09.260
You are the epitome of ally support for us.

02:21:09.820 --> 02:21:15.180
I honestly feel that those who do not know the struggle should take a page from y'all's

02:21:15.180 --> 02:21:16.140
support book and learn.

02:21:16.140 --> 02:21:20.780
And while we're here, I know that it was discussed how Saudi Arabia's investment in

02:21:20.780 --> 02:21:23.420
Nintendo does not sit well with us.

02:21:23.420 --> 02:21:25.580
The issue that Nintendo doesn't know.

02:21:26.540 --> 02:21:29.820
The issue is that Nintendo doesn't know the issue and does not care.

02:21:29.820 --> 02:21:34.300
For example, there was a Saudi Arabian cosplay contest with a top prize of 10 grand.

02:21:34.300 --> 02:21:38.700
A lot of American cosplayers boycotted it where European, Asian, and other international

02:21:38.700 --> 02:21:40.060
cosplayers entered.

02:21:40.060 --> 02:21:43.900
Their reason was simply what's going on between the US and Saudi Arabia has nothing to do

02:21:43.900 --> 02:21:44.540
with me.

02:21:44.540 --> 02:21:45.740
So much for solidarity.

02:21:47.180 --> 02:21:48.220
And one more thing, Rob.

02:21:48.220 --> 02:21:51.420
I know that you've mentioned on how the show can get political.

02:21:51.420 --> 02:21:51.740
Fuck it.

02:21:51.740 --> 02:21:52.700
Let it be.

02:21:52.700 --> 02:21:56.380
The topics that come up affect all of us one way or another, and we need to know.

02:21:56.380 --> 02:22:00.460
For some people, podcasts are the only way people find out anything, so please keep

02:22:00.460 --> 02:22:01.020
it up.

02:22:01.020 --> 02:22:03.820
There's a lot more I want to discuss, but the show is only so long.

02:22:03.820 --> 02:22:05.180
That's all for now.

02:22:05.180 --> 02:22:06.300
Take care, one and all.

02:22:07.020 --> 02:22:07.900
That's from Rajan.

02:22:07.900 --> 02:22:11.500
To be clear on the politics thing, it's not that I want to completely steer clear of politics.

02:22:11.500 --> 02:22:15.740
And I think what ties into some of what you said, too, is that keep in mind that Dark

02:22:15.740 --> 02:22:20.540
Sakura and I both also represent marginalized communities in one way or another.

02:22:20.540 --> 02:22:23.340
We've not been shy about that over the years of the show.

02:22:23.340 --> 02:22:25.820
And to Loki's credit as well, because it's his show, too.

02:22:25.820 --> 02:22:30.940
Even if he is our token, cis-het, white guy on the show, he knows when to listen.

02:22:30.940 --> 02:22:36.380
For all this crap we give Loki about, he says a lot when it comes to Nintendo and how it's

02:22:36.380 --> 02:22:36.780
run.

02:22:37.100 --> 02:22:39.740
So the other thing is Loki knows when to listen.

02:22:39.740 --> 02:22:40.300
Right, Loki?

02:22:42.140 --> 02:22:43.980
That's actually the first step of allyship.

02:22:45.020 --> 02:22:46.220
Absolutely.

02:22:46.220 --> 02:22:47.100
Absolutely it is.

02:22:47.740 --> 02:22:49.980
And the thing is, don't listen to reply.

02:22:50.860 --> 02:22:51.900
Listen to absorb.

02:22:52.620 --> 02:22:53.420
Don't.

02:22:53.420 --> 02:22:55.340
And not everything.

02:22:56.060 --> 02:22:57.820
It's taken me time to learn this, too.

02:22:58.380 --> 02:23:00.300
Not everything needs to be tweeted.

02:23:01.180 --> 02:23:02.940
Sometimes, just listen.

02:23:03.580 --> 02:23:04.620
That's all you need to do.

02:23:05.180 --> 02:23:05.500
Read.

02:23:05.500 --> 02:23:06.000
Oh.

02:23:06.780 --> 02:23:08.140
And I'll add this, too.

02:23:08.140 --> 02:23:10.300
Sometimes not everything is about you.

02:23:10.300 --> 02:23:12.300
That's, that's right, too.

02:23:12.300 --> 02:23:13.100
Absolutely.

02:23:13.740 --> 02:23:15.980
So I told that to somebody and he blocked me.

02:23:17.500 --> 02:23:21.740
But as far as the politics is concerned, I'm not like, look, I do not want this to be one

02:23:21.740 --> 02:23:22.540
of those.

02:23:22.540 --> 02:23:23.980
This is a chill stream.

02:23:23.980 --> 02:23:26.140
Therefore, we don't talk about politics.

02:23:26.140 --> 02:23:29.100
Like, politics affects everybody.

02:23:29.100 --> 02:23:33.980
And for many of the reasons we've outlined before on this program, I don't need to rehash

02:23:33.980 --> 02:23:35.020
them right now.

02:23:35.020 --> 02:23:41.260
My stance is, I want to find the balance of making sure we're still covering the topic

02:23:41.260 --> 02:23:47.420
that people came here to discuss and interjecting as well an awareness of the world around us

02:23:47.420 --> 02:23:48.700
that these games exist in.

02:23:48.700 --> 02:23:54.220
So sometimes I just want to walk the line of finding that balance and making sure that

02:23:54.860 --> 02:24:03.180
we are doing our best to educate, show the other perspectives, and not berate.

02:24:03.180 --> 02:24:09.020
Although there are some things that need to be berated, last name Kotick, first name Bobby,

02:24:09.020 --> 02:24:11.900
as an example, not the Bobby that's on this network.

02:24:11.900 --> 02:24:12.860
You all know what I'm talking about.

02:24:12.860 --> 02:24:14.780
There's more that needs to be done apart from beration.

02:24:14.780 --> 02:24:18.060
So that's kind of my stance on it.

02:24:18.060 --> 02:24:21.260
So just just know, like, sometimes if I'm like, Okay, let's move on.

02:24:21.260 --> 02:24:25.900
It's only because I'm, I'm realizing that the politics talk has taken up a really, really

02:24:25.900 --> 02:24:26.940
good chunk of the show.

02:24:27.500 --> 02:24:32.540
And sometimes all you can do, and I talked about this, we talked about the game that

02:24:32.540 --> 02:24:33.340
shall not be named.

02:24:34.380 --> 02:24:38.780
Sometimes all you could do is put the information in front of somebody.

02:24:39.660 --> 02:24:41.900
Watch how they use that information.

02:24:42.940 --> 02:24:46.860
That will inform what your relationship may or may not look like moving forward,

02:24:47.500 --> 02:24:49.820
how they treat receiving that information.

02:24:50.780 --> 02:24:51.820
And it's as simple as that.

02:24:54.300 --> 02:24:54.800
Good email.

02:24:55.580 --> 02:24:56.700
Yes, very good email.

02:24:57.420 --> 02:25:03.020
I'm going to go ahead and pull up the other email from YYR.

02:25:04.380 --> 02:25:04.860
All right.

02:25:04.860 --> 02:25:06.140
Oh, the font is so small.

02:25:07.740 --> 02:25:12.060
Well, I mean, which is fine by me, I can read small font, but it's just all of a sudden

02:25:12.060 --> 02:25:13.340
it was like, Oh, this is much smaller.

02:25:13.980 --> 02:25:14.860
Hello, LR.

02:25:14.860 --> 02:25:19.740
I was super happy to hear that After Burner Climax was chosen as last episode's ORL classic

02:25:19.740 --> 02:25:20.700
game of the week.

02:25:20.700 --> 02:25:22.460
I've put a lot of hours into that game.

02:25:22.460 --> 02:25:25.500
It's one of my favorite Sega games of the Lindbergh era.

02:25:25.500 --> 02:25:27.980
It's an action packed masterpiece in every respect.

02:25:27.980 --> 02:25:32.460
And to see an almost arcade perfect port make its way to Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 seemed

02:25:32.460 --> 02:25:33.580
like a surreal miracle.

02:25:34.220 --> 02:25:36.540
The announcement of the port came out of nowhere.

02:25:36.540 --> 02:25:39.580
You might be wondering just how did that happen anyway?

02:25:39.580 --> 02:25:40.380
Well, I have a theory.

02:25:41.660 --> 02:25:44.940
One of you mentioned the After Burner styled level in Bayonetta.

02:25:44.940 --> 02:25:45.660
I think that was me.

02:25:46.540 --> 02:25:53.180
Well, there was an article posted by Destructoid in October 2009, link below, sorry, about

02:25:53.180 --> 02:25:58.380
an interview with Bayonetta creator Hideki Kamiya shortly after the game was released.

02:25:58.380 --> 02:26:02.380
Kamiya was asked what Sega game he wanted to see next.

02:26:03.020 --> 02:26:07.180
And out of all the millions of things he could have asked for, he instead humbly requested

02:26:07.180 --> 02:26:09.100
a home version of After Burner Climax.

02:26:09.740 --> 02:26:12.220
I remember seeing this article when it came out.

02:26:12.220 --> 02:26:15.980
I'm not sure if OLR covered it, but I didn't have time to check.

02:26:15.980 --> 02:26:20.060
But surely enough, six months later, boom, Kamiya got his wish and so did everyone else

02:26:20.140 --> 02:26:23.980
looking for a thrilling fight combat game in the comfort of their homes.

02:26:23.980 --> 02:26:27.900
There's only one thing in the arcade version that didn't make it home, the two-player

02:26:27.900 --> 02:26:29.100
pair play mode.

02:26:29.100 --> 02:26:30.860
Sadly, I've never been able to try it.

02:26:30.860 --> 02:26:34.060
I wonder if there are any arcades left that have two working machines.

02:26:34.060 --> 02:26:35.420
Yeah, I've only seen a single machine.

02:26:36.700 --> 02:26:41.100
One thing I absolutely must mention regarding this game is that I was engaged in hardcore

02:26:41.100 --> 02:26:46.700
head-to-head combat with fellow longtime listener SSJ100 Matt on Xbox 360, on the Xbox 360

02:26:46.700 --> 02:26:47.260
version.

02:26:47.260 --> 02:26:50.140
We went back and forth for, what, a whole year, maybe more?

02:26:50.140 --> 02:26:54.940
Each of us topped the other's previous best score more than a handful of times until finally

02:26:54.940 --> 02:27:03.980
Matt achieved his current best of 1,631,770, number 121 overall on the leaderboard out

02:27:03.980 --> 02:27:12.540
of almost 59,000 players, besting my 185th place personal record by about 140K.

02:27:13.500 --> 02:27:17.180
I've always intended to go back and put in the work, but I'll be honest, it's been

02:27:17.180 --> 02:27:21.020
over 10 years since then and I'm not sure my reflexes are still good enough to improve

02:27:21.020 --> 02:27:23.100
any further, but that's a thing for another time.

02:27:23.740 --> 02:27:27.340
And then, Jamie, I did not miss your mention of Deadstorm Pirates.

02:27:27.340 --> 02:27:29.100
That is another one of my favorite games.

02:27:29.100 --> 02:27:34.140
In fact, it's the very first video game I ever played with my wife, Amy, in the Times

02:27:34.140 --> 02:27:35.740
Square Dave and Busters.

02:27:35.740 --> 02:27:41.260
I still have my PS3 hooked up and my two Guncon 3s handy whenever we need to go back to it,

02:27:41.260 --> 02:27:43.900
and my four-year-old already enjoys watching us play it.

02:27:43.980 --> 02:27:48.220
If for some reason you wanted to make Deadstorm a classic game of the week, I would absolutely

02:27:48.220 --> 02:27:50.300
love the opportunity to produce the segment.

02:27:50.300 --> 02:27:50.800
Hey, cool.

02:27:51.340 --> 02:27:54.540
You just tell me how much time to fill and I will fill it.

02:27:55.420 --> 02:28:00.860
Side note, I probably will record audio and send it to you if you do it.

02:28:01.580 --> 02:28:04.780
So then you'll know what to fill.

02:28:06.300 --> 02:28:11.180
Also going to say if we forecast that you're going to be out for a week in the future,

02:28:11.180 --> 02:28:13.660
that might be a thing we can do for a guest segment.

02:28:14.860 --> 02:28:16.140
I'll also end on this.

02:28:16.140 --> 02:28:21.260
I did not miss the mention of the Game Grumps playing super multitasking on their stream.

02:28:21.260 --> 02:28:23.340
Thank you very much as always for the kind words.

02:28:23.340 --> 02:28:28.220
I will say that unfortunately, this alone did not create the sustained word of mouth

02:28:28.220 --> 02:28:30.940
that would have been required for the game to actually become popular.

02:28:30.940 --> 02:28:35.180
However, I did get enough money out of it to buy a brand new gaming computer and monitor

02:28:35.180 --> 02:28:36.860
replace my 10-year-old Frankenrig.

02:28:37.740 --> 02:28:45.580
So I can now play DDR at 120 FPS since the latest PC version supports that and I'm all

02:28:45.580 --> 02:28:49.100
set for early access on Hades 2 whenever that happens.

02:28:49.100 --> 02:28:51.260
Damn right I have my priorities straight.

02:28:51.260 --> 02:28:53.740
Oh, there was one other awesome thing that came out of this.

02:28:53.740 --> 02:28:57.180
I finally have double digit reviews on Steam.

02:28:57.180 --> 02:28:59.420
So now I have an average rating.

02:28:59.420 --> 02:29:01.580
Positive instead of nine user reviews.

02:29:02.700 --> 02:29:04.540
That was up there for literally years.

02:29:04.540 --> 02:29:05.040
Woohoo!

02:29:05.360 --> 02:29:08.880
Sorry for the long email, although I guess I'm not that sorry.

02:29:08.880 --> 02:29:10.320
Otherwise I wouldn't have sent it.

02:29:10.320 --> 02:29:10.720
Oh well.

02:29:10.720 --> 02:29:14.320
Thanks again for the show and congrats on the big 950.

02:29:14.320 --> 02:29:15.200
See you later.

02:29:15.200 --> 02:29:16.080
Aaron Yyr.

02:29:16.640 --> 02:29:17.520
Thanks Yyr.

02:29:17.520 --> 02:29:25.680
And although I'm disappointed to hear that the moment in the spotlight of your game is

02:29:25.680 --> 02:29:29.760
not sustaining, a new computer is a pretty nice tip.

02:29:29.760 --> 02:29:34.480
So I'm glad at least you're getting something that you can spoil yourself with out of that

02:29:34.480 --> 02:29:39.520
because you've done so many fun things and poured your heart into these projects between

02:29:39.520 --> 02:29:43.120
Bungie ferret tossing and super multitasking and so forth.

02:29:43.120 --> 02:29:47.360
I'm really glad that now you at least can get something tangible out of it.

02:29:47.360 --> 02:29:53.200
So while I still wish your game would get the visibility on a mass scale that it deserves,

02:29:54.160 --> 02:29:55.760
I'm really glad at least you got a moment.

02:29:56.960 --> 02:30:00.080
To quote my spouse, it beats a sharp stick in the eye.

02:30:00.080 --> 02:30:01.520
It does beat a sharp stick in the eye.

02:30:01.520 --> 02:30:02.160
And you know what?

02:30:02.160 --> 02:30:02.880
That's true.

02:30:02.880 --> 02:30:08.000
Sometimes, and believe me, I know this from doing a podcast for 21 years.

02:30:08.000 --> 02:30:09.200
My co-host will probably agree.

02:30:09.760 --> 02:30:13.120
Sometimes you don't want to be in the spotlight.

02:30:13.120 --> 02:30:19.440
Sometimes being at that, I'm getting a new computer that maybe that's an okay level to

02:30:19.440 --> 02:30:19.760
be at.

02:30:21.920 --> 02:30:22.320
All right.

02:30:22.880 --> 02:30:24.400
I could use a little bit more spotlight.

02:30:24.960 --> 02:30:29.120
Well, you might have one coming, so we'll see.

02:30:29.120 --> 02:30:29.600
We'll see.

02:30:30.640 --> 02:30:30.960
All right.

02:30:31.840 --> 02:30:35.280
It's hard to be enthusiastic like about that kind of stuff.

02:30:35.280 --> 02:30:40.000
Like, you know, kids are, you know, like I said, we've been doing this for like 21 years

02:30:40.000 --> 02:30:42.240
and we're still in so much obscurity.

02:30:42.240 --> 02:30:43.600
Go, okay, wait, what?

02:30:43.600 --> 02:30:51.360
How do I, how do I find that that reply that you wrote to the Minecraft people with your

02:30:51.360 --> 02:30:51.600
video?

02:30:51.600 --> 02:30:56.640
Oh, you just, it was just hashtag, what was it?

02:30:56.640 --> 02:31:02.640
It's hashtag feature me Minecraft is all in word.

02:31:02.640 --> 02:31:03.360
Okay, hold on.

02:31:03.360 --> 02:31:07.200
Cause I'm going to, I'm going to forget because we got to, we got to find the way to help

02:31:07.200 --> 02:31:08.480
help Loki out right now.

02:31:08.480 --> 02:31:08.720
Okay.

02:31:08.720 --> 02:31:09.760
So feature me Minecraft.

02:31:09.760 --> 02:31:11.840
Well, some people have some pretty interesting things here.

02:31:11.840 --> 02:31:12.080
Okay.

02:31:12.080 --> 02:31:13.760
Oh, look, look, fourth window.

02:31:13.760 --> 02:31:14.880
Oh my gosh.

02:31:14.880 --> 02:31:17.360
Look at this is such a good screenshot that you have here.

02:31:17.360 --> 02:31:22.320
And for the podcast listeners, it's one of the fish from the bubble man stage in, in

02:31:24.320 --> 02:31:25.040
is that the name of it?

02:31:25.040 --> 02:31:25.840
I never knew the name.

02:31:25.840 --> 02:31:26.240
Yeah.

02:31:26.960 --> 02:31:28.400
Recreated in Minecraft.

02:31:28.400 --> 02:31:29.600
These are so cool.

02:31:29.600 --> 02:31:35.920
And in 3d it's, it's hard because Anko had literally three illustrations of it.

02:31:35.920 --> 02:31:36.480
That is it.

02:31:36.480 --> 02:31:38.720
That is all that exists and same with Octoper.

02:31:38.720 --> 02:31:41.520
So here's what I'm going to do to help Loki out to get noticed.

02:31:41.520 --> 02:31:45.600
I'm going to make sure I like that post most importantly, and then I'm going to reply to

02:31:45.600 --> 02:31:49.120
it and I'm going to put, this is so cool.

02:31:49.120 --> 02:31:51.120
I hope they pick you.

02:31:51.520 --> 02:31:56.880
And then I'm going to retweet it and look at that.

02:31:56.880 --> 02:31:58.480
I'm helping with visibility.

02:31:58.480 --> 02:32:00.240
So I appreciate that.

02:32:00.240 --> 02:32:05.120
If everybody goes in there and does something similar, I mean, don't make it obvious.

02:32:05.120 --> 02:32:09.600
You were told to do so, but just like a retweet, it's going to help Loki out big time.

02:32:09.600 --> 02:32:12.640
If even just like five people listening tonight did that, it would be helpful.

02:32:12.640 --> 02:32:14.240
So awesome.

02:32:15.680 --> 02:32:16.400
Good luck to you.

02:32:17.600 --> 02:32:17.840
All right.

02:32:17.840 --> 02:32:18.400
What?

02:32:19.040 --> 02:32:22.320
I just, uh, Bobby.

02:32:22.320 --> 02:32:23.440
What, uh, what did he say?

02:32:24.880 --> 02:32:28.960
Well, like how Rob doesn't use the arrows between the four images and encloses the real

02:32:31.120 --> 02:32:33.920
look, that's how often I use Twitter anymore.

02:32:33.920 --> 02:32:34.880
That's for sure.

02:32:34.880 --> 02:32:36.240
Hey, even, wow.

02:32:36.240 --> 02:32:36.640
Wow.

02:32:36.640 --> 02:32:43.040
Loki, this, this alone should be worth the hours upon hours of effort you put into this.

02:32:43.120 --> 02:32:47.680
Shad Leland or Shane is in chat saying that stuff was top notch.

02:32:47.680 --> 02:32:48.640
No joke.

02:32:48.640 --> 02:32:50.480
Shane isn't impressed by anything.

02:32:50.480 --> 02:32:52.480
Isn't like, you know, Pokemon.

02:32:52.480 --> 02:32:55.600
So that's quite the compliment.

02:32:55.600 --> 02:33:03.360
That one build, the Octopus, the Octoper, um, took like, it was like 80 hours or so to

02:33:03.360 --> 02:33:07.680
put together and it's, it's 300,000 blocks.

02:33:08.480 --> 02:33:10.720
That's my starter base, that one right there, the met.

02:33:10.720 --> 02:33:11.840
So that, that's always fun.

02:33:12.560 --> 02:33:14.800
Yeah, but that one right there and they're all functional too.

02:33:14.800 --> 02:33:18.080
So like that right there is a guardian or a guardian farm.

02:33:18.080 --> 02:33:24.880
So underneath there's a, um, a guardian temple and they go inside there and then they end

02:33:24.880 --> 02:33:30.640
up in an XP farm and then the Octoper is actually covering up a stacking raid farm.

02:33:30.640 --> 02:33:32.480
So it's all functional stuff.

02:33:32.480 --> 02:33:33.920
Um, and it's huge.

02:33:33.920 --> 02:33:40.560
Like even just building in my base, I am now like, I see that Octopus out just on the ocean,

02:33:40.560 --> 02:33:41.440
like out there.

02:33:41.440 --> 02:33:43.040
It's, it's enormous.

02:33:43.040 --> 02:33:44.960
My base is going to be enormous.

02:33:45.680 --> 02:33:47.040
It already is enormous.

02:33:47.040 --> 02:33:51.360
And each, each section of the base I do is like a size of another mega base.

02:33:51.360 --> 02:33:53.120
It's like ridiculous.

02:33:53.120 --> 02:33:54.800
Well, and, and Shane and anyone listed.

02:33:54.800 --> 02:33:58.400
So Shane actually further went on to say it honestly looks better than the official Mega

02:33:58.400 --> 02:33:59.840
Man X pack they just put out.

02:33:59.840 --> 02:34:03.760
Well, keep in mind, Loki gives tours of all of these in his videos.

02:34:03.760 --> 02:34:06.720
So if you aren't, you know, for those that have no idea, cause they're listening on the

02:34:06.720 --> 02:34:07.920
podcast feed, which is great.

02:34:07.920 --> 02:34:08.800
We love you too.

02:34:09.120 --> 02:34:14.080
Loki's Twitter to retweet and all that is over at Loki O L R all one word, uh, on Twitter.

02:34:14.080 --> 02:34:16.720
And then, uh, of course his YouTube channel is same thing, right?

02:34:16.720 --> 02:34:17.920
Or is there an underscore on YouTube?

02:34:17.920 --> 02:34:21.440
It's well, YouTube has that wonderful at thing now.

02:34:21.440 --> 02:34:25.200
So you can just do youtube.com slash at Loki O L R.

02:34:25.200 --> 02:34:26.000
Perfect.

02:34:26.000 --> 02:34:29.680
So, and then, uh, make sure you can actually watch those videos.

02:34:29.680 --> 02:34:31.840
So fabulous.

02:34:31.840 --> 02:34:33.520
Just past 800 subs.

02:34:33.520 --> 02:34:36.160
So slowly making it there.

02:34:36.160 --> 02:34:37.520
And subs are free.

02:34:37.520 --> 02:34:38.960
They're like follows on Twitch.

02:34:38.960 --> 02:34:41.760
That's the free cause sub on Twitch means money.

02:34:41.760 --> 02:34:42.640
But yeah.

02:34:43.920 --> 02:34:44.240
Wow.

02:34:44.240 --> 02:34:46.160
I think you, you know what?

02:34:46.160 --> 02:34:51.600
You have more follows on YouTube than I think dark Sakura or I or VOG network have on Twitch.

02:34:51.600 --> 02:34:54.560
So maybe you shouldn't be complaining.

02:34:55.600 --> 02:34:56.720
I'm getting there.

02:34:56.720 --> 02:34:57.680
Yeah, no, you are.

02:34:57.680 --> 02:34:58.320
You are.

02:34:58.320 --> 02:35:02.080
Um, uh, I think fog and network is sadly in last place.

02:35:02.080 --> 02:35:04.320
We need to, we need to up the visibility here.

02:35:04.320 --> 02:35:08.320
It's not a contest, but, uh, we need to up the visibility here at VOG network because

02:35:08.320 --> 02:35:10.320
when one of us wins, we all win.

02:35:10.960 --> 02:35:12.320
That's the power of network.

02:35:12.320 --> 02:35:15.520
By the way, we need to have a power meeting.

02:35:17.520 --> 02:35:17.840
Okay.

02:35:19.040 --> 02:35:20.800
Soon, but not tonight.

02:35:20.800 --> 02:35:21.120
All right.

02:35:22.400 --> 02:35:22.720
All right.

02:35:23.600 --> 02:35:25.040
Uh, I think with that, we're done.

02:35:25.040 --> 02:35:28.560
I didn't see anybody join the green room, so that is it.

02:35:28.560 --> 02:35:31.040
Plus we're running a little long anyway, so I want to make sure we wrap up.

02:35:31.040 --> 02:35:34.560
I already told you I'm starting to fade as the night goes on and I get to go back to

02:35:34.560 --> 02:35:35.120
work tomorrow.

02:35:35.120 --> 02:35:35.680
Woo.

02:35:35.680 --> 02:35:36.880
At least I work at home.

02:35:36.880 --> 02:35:40.160
I get to message the queen of chaos.

02:35:40.160 --> 02:35:45.040
I get to read 5,000 emails when I get back to work tomorrow.

02:35:45.040 --> 02:35:48.560
So let's go around and get final thoughts and say our good nights and all that good

02:35:48.560 --> 02:35:48.880
stuff.

02:35:48.880 --> 02:35:50.720
Um, dark Sakura, of course, I'll start with you.

02:35:50.720 --> 02:35:53.600
I know you're going to go do some dead by daylight after the show tonight.

02:35:53.600 --> 02:35:56.160
Um, do you have a final thought for our listeners tonight?

02:35:57.120 --> 02:36:01.920
Um, you know how everyone, how people call dead by daylight, Debbie delight.

02:36:03.120 --> 02:36:09.040
I was watching some scenes from singles the other day and there's the character Debbie

02:36:09.680 --> 02:36:13.120
and all of a sudden my brain went to come to where the action is.

02:36:13.680 --> 02:36:14.960
Come to Debbie town.

02:36:16.720 --> 02:36:19.200
And you'd have to see that movie to get it.

02:36:19.200 --> 02:36:22.080
But well, stay tuned for some Debbie town after the show.

02:36:22.880 --> 02:36:23.360
Yep.

02:36:23.360 --> 02:36:24.160
Later taters.

02:36:24.160 --> 02:36:24.800
All right.

02:36:24.800 --> 02:36:25.280
Bye bye.

02:36:25.840 --> 02:36:27.200
I forgot my usual spiel.

02:36:27.200 --> 02:36:29.840
If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Lodge Radio, tell a friend or two about the

02:36:29.840 --> 02:36:30.240
show.

02:36:30.240 --> 02:36:32.960
Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we

02:36:32.960 --> 02:36:35.120
need more voices to put out on air.

02:36:35.120 --> 02:36:40.080
A nice five star review on a site like iTunes or Spotify, wherever it is you found this

02:36:40.080 --> 02:36:42.400
show, those go an awful long way.

02:36:42.400 --> 02:36:45.040
A like and a retweet go an awful long way.

02:36:45.040 --> 02:36:45.680
That's for sure.

02:36:46.480 --> 02:36:48.000
Loki, your final thought for tonight?

02:36:48.880 --> 02:36:51.600
I'm just going to be working more on content creation.

02:36:51.600 --> 02:36:58.400
Still want to try to get back down to weekly videos, but it's just I do too.

02:36:58.400 --> 02:36:59.760
I overscope everything.

02:36:59.760 --> 02:37:00.880
You know, it's a problem.

02:37:02.080 --> 02:37:05.600
But at the same time, those Mega Man things.

02:37:05.600 --> 02:37:07.120
God damn, that's so impressive.

02:37:07.120 --> 02:37:08.880
So yeah, although yes, I agree.

02:37:08.880 --> 02:37:11.440
And you do need to lower your scope.

02:37:11.440 --> 02:37:14.240
Damn, sometimes when you do it, it's like, okay, wow.

02:37:14.240 --> 02:37:15.120
Yeah, I mean, it's

02:37:15.120 --> 02:37:16.400
I can't help myself.

02:37:16.400 --> 02:37:17.920
I have to keep doing that.

02:37:17.920 --> 02:37:20.400
Think about the advice I gave Square Enix earlier.

02:37:21.120 --> 02:37:23.760
Do the low hanging fruit to give that platform.

02:37:23.760 --> 02:37:24.720
I know.

02:37:24.720 --> 02:37:26.400
I just need to pace myself.

02:37:27.520 --> 02:37:28.020
Yes, you do.

02:37:29.200 --> 02:37:29.520
All right.

02:37:30.080 --> 02:37:34.880
My final thought is I'll be back to doing some streaming this week as well over my personal

02:37:34.880 --> 02:37:35.920
channel, Rob Roberts.

02:37:35.920 --> 02:37:40.640
I will be doing some theater rhythm a couple days this week, and I'll be doing No Man's

02:37:40.640 --> 02:37:42.720
Sky on Tuesday, Thursday.

02:37:43.280 --> 02:37:47.760
Of course, again, Star Trek Cruise wrap up here at VOG Network.

02:37:47.760 --> 02:37:48.480
So check that out.

02:37:48.560 --> 02:37:52.240
If nothing else, even if you could give a shit about Star Trek or the Cruise, come watch

02:37:52.240 --> 02:37:54.480
me get yelled at for playing Overwatch badly.

02:37:54.480 --> 02:37:57.760
I'm subjecting myself to that for y'all's entertainment.

02:37:57.760 --> 02:37:58.560
That's going to do it.

02:37:59.440 --> 02:38:06.480
Thanks so much for being here for our 950th episode, 50 more until we hit 1000 weekly

02:38:06.480 --> 02:38:07.120
podcasts.

02:38:07.120 --> 02:38:12.000
And not a lot of internet shows have hit 1000 weekly episodes.

02:38:12.000 --> 02:38:16.560
I know some other like gaming and other shows, they've hit 1000 episodes for maybe multiples

02:38:16.560 --> 02:38:17.440
a week and so forth.

02:38:18.080 --> 02:38:22.640
Not a lot on any topic, really, that have made the 1000 weekly episodes club.

02:38:22.640 --> 02:38:29.360
So thank you all for making that a distinct reality for our show as we move in to the

02:38:29.360 --> 02:38:31.840
next year and beyond.

02:38:32.400 --> 02:38:33.360
Have a good week, everybody.

02:38:33.360 --> 02:38:36.320
We'll see you next time here on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:38:36.320 --> 02:38:36.800
