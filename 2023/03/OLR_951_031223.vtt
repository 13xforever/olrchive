Grease the wheels of your Diablo IV excitement with the KFC Double Down! With the mere order

00:13.920 --> 00:18.000
and optional consumption of a KFC Double Down, you will be the recipient of a Diablo IV beta

00:18.000 --> 00:21.440
code, along with an overactive heart rate needed to achieve digestion of that quote

00:21.440 --> 00:26.160
unquote sandwich. Next month's headline, KFC reports record order levels of the return

00:26.160 --> 00:30.800
of a Double Down. Gee, I wonder why. This is the Triple D intro. Now it's time for your

00:30.800 --> 00:34.080
hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about this and the rest of

00:34.080 --> 00:37.280
the week's foodie news. Starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

00:39.280 --> 00:44.640
Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where

00:44.640 --> 00:52.880
every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio, and we are live once again with episode

00:53.200 --> 01:02.080
number 951 of our show for March the 12th of 2023. My name is Rob Roberts and I am joined

01:02.080 --> 01:08.480
every week, oftentimes by DarkSakura or Jamie Summers, except she's not here at the moment,

01:08.480 --> 01:13.200
but she'll be joining us a little later on in the show. She has had a little bit of an overlap with

01:13.200 --> 01:18.240
another Twitch stream she was invited to participate with tonight. And hey, if it gets

01:18.240 --> 01:24.640
her a chance to advertise this show and podcast in front of a new crowd, then I say go for it,

01:24.640 --> 01:28.880
because I still have here to entertain me for the first hour or so. Say hello, as always,

01:28.880 --> 01:34.080
to Techmaster Loki. That's a really a high bar for me to hit entertaining, but I am here.

01:35.200 --> 01:39.920
Well, if not, I can watch the video game that's playing behind you as we do tape live

01:39.920 --> 01:45.040
every Sunday night at twitch.tv slash vog network. That's a VOG network for the Voice

01:45.040 --> 01:50.320
of Geeks network. Twitch TV, VOG network, 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific, daylight

01:50.320 --> 01:55.680
time now right after the Bobby Black Wolf show. Hopefully I forgot to tweet about the time change.

01:55.680 --> 02:01.120
I'm hoping everybody remembers. It's not the people in the places that time change,

02:01.120 --> 02:06.720
it's the people in the places that don't time change that I worry forget, oh yeah,

02:06.720 --> 02:11.840
you know, the US, you know, well, most, I think what, 48 states do daylight savings time,

02:11.840 --> 02:17.360
so most of the US change their clocks, even if we didn't. So hopefully everybody caught wind of

02:17.360 --> 02:22.560
that. But I think everything is scheduled on the Twitch page. So if you ever are unsure, like what

02:22.560 --> 02:27.040
time is it in my time, if you just go to twitch.tv slash vog network, there's a schedule that shows

02:27.040 --> 02:33.280
you what everything is on. It makes it very easy. All right. Anyway, I was pointing out that there's

02:33.280 --> 02:38.560
a game that plays behind you and tonight it looks like is this South Park Stick of Truth or the

02:38.560 --> 02:43.840
Fractured? Oh, this, it's the first one. It's the Stick of Truth. Yeah. Yeah. What made you

02:43.840 --> 02:48.320
pick this game tonight? I don't know. I saw some South Park clips earlier in the week,

02:48.320 --> 02:52.720
and it's pretty funny. Yeah. So it's just, it's interesting that the power,

02:52.720 --> 02:56.400
what this was on PlayStation three, right? It's interesting that the power of the PlayStation

02:56.400 --> 03:02.960
three was enough to pretty much accurately draw South Park to look exactly like the show because

03:02.960 --> 03:08.320
obviously the joke is South Park isn't exactly known for its expert animation, but more the

03:08.320 --> 03:12.640
biting humor, I suppose. It was a great game. Both of them were a great game.

03:12.640 --> 03:15.920
I'm surprised there hasn't been another one yet. Maybe they're working on it.

03:15.920 --> 03:21.920
I hope that there will be one because they are actually very good RPGs. Like they're really

03:21.920 --> 03:26.880
entertaining. And especially if you like the show, it's just, it's, it's just good. It's just good

03:26.880 --> 03:33.760
writing all around. So yeah. Going to our chat because again, as we tape live at vog network,

03:33.760 --> 03:40.640
we enjoy seeing your chat comments tonight. Vo by Kurt. Hello. Shout out to my DragonCon buddy

03:40.640 --> 03:46.640
says time changed for the last time, right? No. Even though, at least in California,

03:46.640 --> 03:51.840
we voted to make daylight savings permanent, like in 2017, there's a whole process that

03:51.840 --> 03:55.600
has to go through. And my understanding was what we voted on was only advisory.

03:55.600 --> 04:00.800
It was basically saying we want this and it still has to go through this whole,

04:00.800 --> 04:05.120
basically Congress has to approve it. And we all know how effective Congress is. Congress

04:05.120 --> 04:08.880
isn't doing literally anything. So unfortunately it's one of those things. We're just going to

04:08.880 --> 04:14.960
keep going back and forth for some time. I like the late sun, especially, you know,

04:14.960 --> 04:19.680
sometimes the seasons, you know, I've been pretty open. The seasons can kind of affect my mood,

04:19.680 --> 04:24.320
especially this year when we've had like a lot, a lot of rain. So I prefer daylight savings.

04:24.320 --> 04:28.960
I understand there's other people that may have like sleeping issues that maybe

04:28.960 --> 04:34.560
feel the reverse. So you know, but we read it, even if we just do 30 minutes forward,

04:34.560 --> 04:40.800
then fine, make a compromise, then we just need to stick with it permanently and be done with it.

04:40.800 --> 04:45.760
But yeah, I think that like one of the arguments I know is like kids starting school like seven

04:45.760 --> 04:50.400
o'clock, which why are they set in school at seven o'clock, but it's like dark out,

04:51.360 --> 04:55.360
I guess, is one of the things then just start them later.

04:55.360 --> 05:01.520
But yeah, I know. Then they can stay outside and play until like seven o'clock at night. But then

05:01.520 --> 05:07.600
again, who sends kids outside to play anymore? There's danger outside. Even though I was told

05:07.600 --> 05:12.160
to go outside and play, I would stay in and play video games, as would I think a lot of you.

05:14.560 --> 05:20.800
Also, there's a big ceremony on TV tonight that has a whole lot of pomp and circumstance,

05:20.800 --> 05:25.360
and there's fashion and cute dresses and tuxedos. The only Oscar I want to hear about

05:25.360 --> 05:30.480
tonight lives in a trashcan. Let me put it that way. Here's the thing. It's not that I'm like

05:30.480 --> 05:36.000
morally opposed to them or whatever. It's just, it doesn't change anything. As far as I'm concerned,

05:36.000 --> 05:42.400
Everything Everywhere All at Once is one of the best movies I've ever seen, period. And no silly

05:42.400 --> 05:48.560
statue race is going to change that or take that away from me or change that movie. And that's that.

05:48.560 --> 05:53.440
Some people I know get really into it. But it's just one of those things where then I feel like,

05:54.400 --> 05:57.520
you know, I'm not trying to sound too hippie dippie, but it's like, we're pitting women

05:57.520 --> 06:02.560
against each other. We're pitting works of art against each other. And it's just this whole

06:02.560 --> 06:09.280
mess that just feels, it just feels silly. Like, I get it's Hollywood's night or whatever,

06:09.280 --> 06:13.200
but it would be nice if we could maybe just recognize it without all this frickin'

06:13.920 --> 06:20.160
what ends up being basically political of a sort, not necessarily red versus blue, but politics

06:20.160 --> 06:23.200
of a different sort behind the scenes. It just kind of takes away from the whole thing to be

06:23.200 --> 06:29.280
honest. Although to tie it into games, because yes, it does tie into games. And before we get

06:29.280 --> 06:34.240
to our kickoff, let me bring this up. Loki, have you heard anything about these streaming awards?

06:34.240 --> 06:42.320
Because I was seeing stuff on this on Twitter. Yeah, I knew that they were a thing. I am very

06:42.320 --> 06:48.880
happy to see that. What was it? There was a category called League of Their Own. And that

06:48.880 --> 06:54.080
Doug Doug won that because I really think he's a great streamer. And so I was happy to see he's

06:54.080 --> 06:58.320
like, I don't think I'm going to win this. I don't even know why I got nominated. Like I wasn't,

06:58.320 --> 07:04.560
I was purposely not campaigning to be in this. And like, and he not only did he get in,

07:04.560 --> 07:08.640
but he also won, which is kind of funny. He's like, I don't know why I'm here and winning,

07:08.640 --> 07:12.720
but okay, thanks. What's interesting, I've seen, I've seen a lot of people that were kind of

07:12.720 --> 07:18.000
talking down about it too. And I was just trying to kind of think like, well, why? Because I don't,

07:18.000 --> 07:23.280
you know, and why, why am I so poo poo on the Oscars yet? I'll follow the game awards. And I

07:23.280 --> 07:28.800
think so here's, here's why it's a little weird. And like, and I don't, I don't follow it close

07:28.800 --> 07:34.000
enough. But like, it is put on by I don't remember what her name is something princess, but it's

07:34.080 --> 07:39.120
Ludwig's girlfriend and Ludwig is also nominated for these categories.

07:39.120 --> 07:43.840
Get a fucking whiteboard and draw out the relationships. I need a TikTok that I didn't

07:43.840 --> 07:50.160
even know that was a princess. Like it's not supposed to be like a big deal because it's not

07:50.160 --> 07:55.840
like it's, it's like, it's not like, Oh, because of that Ludwig's gonna win all the categories

07:55.840 --> 07:59.200
or something like that. But of course, you know, people want to like point at each other too.

08:00.080 --> 08:05.520
But like, it's, it's just it's, it's unnecessary drama. I don't really follow a lot of streamers.

08:05.520 --> 08:10.240
So like the one I do follow, I'm glad he won. I mean, because I think it's, it's awesome. Like,

08:10.240 --> 08:16.080
all of his streams are like, I can genuinely say all of it. Well, even when he's not doing

08:16.080 --> 08:22.400
anything, it's still genuinely entertaining. And like the concepts that he puts out in his videos,

08:22.400 --> 08:29.520
a lot of it has a ton of chat interaction, stuff like that is, is just really fun. Like if I see

08:29.520 --> 08:33.280
like his a notification that he's streaming, it's like, I got to immediately watch it. Like, it's

08:33.280 --> 08:39.680
just that good. So I am I'm glad that he did win that category, even though he didn't really care

08:39.680 --> 08:46.720
to win or want to win. I think part of the reason why the streaming awards gets a little bit of

08:46.720 --> 08:51.440
pushback and I not to say as some people I guess are into it, I was seeing some positive chat on

08:51.440 --> 08:56.640
social media as well. But for me, I kind of felt like it, the takeaway is it's kind of a fat,

08:56.640 --> 09:00.880
get fatter sort of thing that a lot of the people that are getting acknowledged at these types of

09:00.880 --> 09:05.680
ceremonies, it, it, they don't really need it. And it's, it's one of those types of, it just feels

09:05.680 --> 09:09.680
like it's a big click. And I understand they have two or three categories that are intentionally set

09:09.680 --> 09:16.000
up to be the next big thing or congratulations, little person, Pat, Pat, Pat, you're doing a great

09:16.000 --> 09:21.280
job streaming. Here's a lollipop and a pat on the ass. Like it's just, you know, there's some,

09:21.280 --> 09:26.080
there's some kind of playing to the underdog categories, but otherwise it just feels like

09:26.080 --> 09:29.920
a fat getting fatter type of thing. And it's like a lot of the people that are nominated,

09:29.920 --> 09:33.040
you're like, you know, and I'm not going to name names because I'm not trying to be a total bitch,

09:33.040 --> 09:35.920
but you, you all know what I'm talking about. Like, there's just names where it's like,

09:35.920 --> 09:40.400
there are websites that report on when these people take a fart and it's like,

09:40.400 --> 09:47.520
is it, it's just, it's just wild to me that, that some of these streamers are,

09:47.520 --> 09:55.920
are that influential, but that's the world we live in now, I guess. So anyway, ZenMonkey11

09:55.920 --> 10:00.320
in chat says the show was bad, but there's a place for it. There wasn't any big name streamers like

10:00.320 --> 10:04.240
that. Well, I heard a lot of them canceled. I looked at the nominee list and there were

10:04.240 --> 10:09.360
plenty of nominees like that. So I, if they didn't show up, then that's a whole different

10:09.360 --> 10:15.520
drama thing. But you know, um, I sort of feel like you want to be careful what bridges you burn

10:15.520 --> 10:20.080
in the gaming industry. And that would even go around influencers as well, because you never

10:20.080 --> 10:26.640
know. You never know. That's why I don't name names. You never know. Um, also one other point

10:26.640 --> 10:31.520
I want to touch on before we get into the actual, you know, lead topic tonight, I want to address

10:31.520 --> 10:37.600
why am I so poo poo on the Oscars, but we talk about the game awards here. I think one of the

10:37.600 --> 10:42.080
big things is that the game awards is still kind of an up and coming news ceremony because they

10:42.080 --> 10:48.080
also fuse it with a lot of the gaming news. They've kind of forced that show to be very

10:48.080 --> 10:54.560
relevant. And quite honestly, I think many, the other differences, many of us know the awards

10:54.560 --> 11:00.560
don't matter to us, the fandom. Now I understand the awards can go a long way on somebody's resume

11:00.560 --> 11:05.600
and so forth, but most of the time, most of us are sitting here going, yeah, of course that game won

11:05.600 --> 11:10.880
or, okay, yeah, of course, you know, you want to talk about a fat, get fatter type of thing. Like

11:10.880 --> 11:15.600
a lot of the game award stuff just ends up being whatever. It's more of a sideshow to everything

11:15.600 --> 11:21.680
else going on. Whereas like with the Oscars, I'm like, dang, people really invest a lot into why

11:21.680 --> 11:27.840
somebody fricking lost a particular award or whatever it is when it's just like, there's a,

11:28.960 --> 11:33.040
there's a lot of weird people that vote on those things in the first place. There's been a lot of

11:33.040 --> 11:39.120
interesting articles about that stuff this last week. But anyway, it's whatever. Award shows,

11:39.120 --> 11:45.760
they're always going to be out there. What can you do? All right, let's talk about what else is going

11:45.760 --> 11:50.960
on in the gaming industry this week. And actually, to start tonight, I want to talk about more of a

11:50.960 --> 11:56.960
platform that a lot of us have started using in the last few years. And this platform was really

11:56.960 --> 12:02.800
only getting bigger and bigger during the pandemic and so forth. And that's Discord. There's been a

12:02.800 --> 12:08.560
lot of news surrounding Discord this week. For one, the official PlayStation 5 firmware that

12:08.560 --> 12:15.520
integrated Discord support was released. So now you can finally join a Discord chat room from

12:15.520 --> 12:21.280
well, actually, you don't even join it from your PlayStation 5. You push a button in the Discord

12:21.280 --> 12:26.800
app and it like sends it to your PlayStation 5. It's a little, it's a little messy, but I guess

12:26.800 --> 12:32.320
it's how they had to do it. It works. It's cool, whatever. But the interesting thing about it is

12:32.320 --> 12:40.400
now you have what is essentially official support to talk to people on Xbox and PlayStation

12:40.400 --> 12:45.920
across those two. Now, granted, a lot of people are using Discord to do this anyway for games

12:45.920 --> 12:50.720
that supported cross-play, but it is interesting that now that is naturally embedded of sorts. So

12:50.720 --> 12:54.320
I think that part is interesting. So that's some good news in Discord's hat this week.

12:54.960 --> 12:59.120
Some other things where maybe the news is a little more a bit of a question mark.

12:59.760 --> 13:07.120
One of them has to do with AI. That's right. AI experiences are going to be expanding within

13:07.120 --> 13:12.720
Discord, including a popular thing, I guess, that's been coming. I've seen this. I've never

13:12.720 --> 13:18.560
played with it myself, but it's called Chat GPT. In a tweet this week, Discord wrote,

13:18.560 --> 13:23.520
when it comes to sharing AI experiences with your friends, there's no place like Discord. Today,

13:23.520 --> 13:28.240
we're introducing new AI experiments, including an AI chat bot named Clyde,

13:28.240 --> 13:35.440
Automod AI, and conversation summaries, and launching an AI incubator. Now, Clyde has always

13:35.440 --> 13:39.680
been a part of Discord. That's a robot that's supposed to help you get through the platform,

13:39.680 --> 13:46.000
but basically they're adding a little more AI into it through Chat GPT. So Clyde can now talk like

13:46.000 --> 13:52.400
this Chat GPT, which I remember when this was all an AOL IAM bot that you... What was the name of

13:52.400 --> 13:57.200
that AOL IAM bot you could message and have conversations with? It was so silly. Anyway.

13:58.400 --> 14:06.320
Yeah. LincolnleeTV in chat says, AI is getting crazy. It is, and some people would say for worse,

14:06.320 --> 14:13.200
not always for better. An example of that would be when all the new profile picture things started

14:13.200 --> 14:21.440
showing up recently, right? So those big art apps, a lot was coming out about how those art apps were

14:21.440 --> 14:27.120
learning, and it was learning from people that weren't necessarily opting in to wanting to being

14:27.120 --> 14:32.960
learned from, and therefore you had a lot of the styles of these magically generated profile picks

14:32.960 --> 14:40.080
and things were essentially heavily influenced, dare I say, ripped off of other people's artwork.

14:40.880 --> 14:46.480
And so that is leading people to ask, how is Discord going to train its AI?

14:47.440 --> 14:53.920
Discord has access to almost all the chat in the world right now. Not just voice chat,

14:53.920 --> 14:59.280
but chat in channels, now chat with robots and so forth. They have a very interesting platform to

14:59.280 --> 15:05.760
be able to expand AI. Discord, by the way, has come out this week and said they're not recording

15:05.760 --> 15:11.280
your voice chats or your live streams because there was a policy update that came out. And that

15:11.280 --> 15:17.440
concerns some people. A new policy going into effect March 27th said any content that you upload

15:17.440 --> 15:24.000
to the service could be collected or stored by Discord. Custom emojis, shared files, voice

15:24.000 --> 15:29.920
messages, written posts, yeah. A Discord representative in an interview with PC Gamer said,

15:30.480 --> 15:34.320
there has not been a change in our position regarding recording user content.

15:36.320 --> 15:40.480
In the updated policy, we provided clarity to outdated language that might be confusing,

15:40.480 --> 15:45.680
giving some upcoming product enhancements and releases, what I just talked about. However,

15:45.680 --> 15:51.760
we want to be clear, Discord does not store or record user content without their knowledge.

15:52.720 --> 15:57.520
But of course, this leads a lot of skeptics to ask, well, does it process, it doesn't

15:57.520 --> 16:03.600
necessarily have to save it in order to process what it needs in real time, right? And plus,

16:03.600 --> 16:08.720
a lot of this stuff is naturally stored on a cloud anyway, maybe not your voice chats,

16:08.720 --> 16:12.240
but the chats that you're having, the files that you're sending and those sorts of things. There's

16:12.240 --> 16:16.240
still plenty of reasons for people to be skeptical with this. And I kind of get it.

16:18.240 --> 16:24.320
Anyway, some of the other AI features that are going to be coming to Discord. I guess there's

16:24.320 --> 16:31.040
also an avatar remix feature. It allows you to remix other avatars using generative image models.

16:32.000 --> 16:36.800
Sounds very familiar to what I was just talking about. But this code they say is available on

16:36.800 --> 16:42.640
GitHub for developers to use. So at least there is a transparency around that. But all of this is

16:42.640 --> 16:48.240
very interesting. And I'm kind of curious, what do you all think about this? Do you welcome AI?

16:49.040 --> 16:53.680
Or are you thinking about the Cylons and Battlestar Galactica, or just the fact that it

16:53.680 --> 16:59.440
feels a little weird, that maybe some of the things you're doing and saying could be playing

16:59.440 --> 17:05.920
into the development of these systems? I will point out, something that's also come around on

17:05.920 --> 17:12.800
social media and other blog posts and things is that you can actually go in and turn off in your

17:12.800 --> 17:18.960
settings on Discord. You can actually turn off some of those listening features. I'm a little

17:18.960 --> 17:22.800
hesitant to show my settings screen live here as we're broadcasting because I don't know what

17:22.800 --> 17:27.120
sensitive information might be in there and I don't want to look live. However, I do know if

17:27.120 --> 17:30.960
you go into your options and you look at some of the various settings, and maybe somebody in chat

17:30.960 --> 17:37.360
can point out what specific menu it is, you can disable Discord to actually because there's these

17:37.360 --> 17:42.720
all these things about upload data or share my data to improve Discord. And there's a lot of

17:42.720 --> 17:46.560
people that are shutting that off right now. And what's funny, and this is something I noticed

17:46.560 --> 17:52.320
because I shut it off because, well, why I fucking pay a monthly fee for Discord. I don't need to be

17:52.320 --> 17:57.600
sending them data. I'm helping them financially, right? I turned it off. And I was welcomed with

17:57.600 --> 18:01.600
a message when I logged in over in the corner where it showed where my friends were playing.

18:01.600 --> 18:07.600
It actually said, you could make this more useful by turning this feature on. And I was like,

18:07.600 --> 18:14.000
Oh, that's shady. Leave me alone. I don't think that's necessarily like, I think everyone's

18:14.000 --> 18:19.200
really blown this out of proportion. Because, you know, as far as app feedback goes, and so

18:19.200 --> 18:23.760
like that, that's something that's baked into a lot of apps. It's, it's usually like crash reports

18:23.840 --> 18:28.240
and stuff like that, you know, that they can understand, okay, hey, people are crashing

18:28.240 --> 18:32.400
because of this bug in this exception or whatever, and they can go and fix software a little bit

18:32.400 --> 18:38.320
better. Or they'll see, you know, generic user statistics on like, okay, like, for example,

18:38.320 --> 18:42.000
with Windows does this sometimes, or even like different web browsers, like, okay,

18:42.000 --> 18:47.920
we have a ton of people using the, you know, they're using the calculator app, let's really,

18:47.920 --> 18:52.800
you know, try to put some development time into the calculator app to make it better or something

18:52.800 --> 18:58.480
like that. Or hey, they're not looking at this thing that we just added. Let's figure out why.

18:59.280 --> 19:03.200
That's kind of the user statistics that they're looking at that they're not, I don't think

19:03.200 --> 19:09.280
training chat GPT off of Discord information, because why would you do that when the internet

19:09.280 --> 19:13.680
exists, you can literally train it off of the internet. And it's a way bigger data set anyways,

19:13.680 --> 19:18.320
than what they've got. Plus, they're just using the API, which is, I think, trained off of all

19:18.320 --> 19:26.400
this stuff already. You have like, for example, edge, having kind of an even more enhanced versus

19:26.400 --> 19:31.520
a chat GPT that actually can search the web now. And it's actually really exciting to see how,

19:31.520 --> 19:37.440
you know, you can ask it a question, and it comes out with answers and site sources that you can

19:37.440 --> 19:42.320
like, you know, look at things, it's almost like an actual like, when they're talking about like,

19:42.320 --> 19:45.840
digital assistants and stuff like that, like courthouse socks, like that, that was just awful

19:45.840 --> 19:50.160
that they they even named it a stupid thing, Cortana, they should have waited till this AI

19:50.160 --> 19:55.920
stuff came out. But it's actually now fulfilling that promise that they had made before where it's

19:55.920 --> 20:01.760
like, it actually will make things easier for you and stuff like that. And I get it, like the

20:01.760 --> 20:09.040
training stuff is a little bit sketchy right now. And I think a lot of it was rushed, people trying

20:09.040 --> 20:14.880
to rush to market to get something viable. And so because of they cut a lot of corners,

20:15.360 --> 20:19.040
you know, they're like, but look how they I think they thought, like, hey, people are gonna see how

20:19.040 --> 20:23.120
amazing this is, it's gonna be awesome. And they're not gonna think about what data sets we,

20:23.680 --> 20:31.520
you know, we use to try to like, make this thing learn. And yeah, they're not happy with it

20:31.520 --> 20:36.320
generating images that say Getty images, obviously, and stuff like that. But I don't think it's like

20:36.320 --> 20:41.680
evil stuff yet. I mean, certainly, yeah, we can eventually convince it to be evil. But like,

20:41.680 --> 20:45.760
right now, it's I think it'd be pretty amazing. I think this is gonna be like the next big step in

20:45.760 --> 20:49.920
just technology and the internet is going to be AI. And it's actually pretty exciting,

20:49.920 --> 20:54.320
like all the stuff that you can do. Like I liked the fact that like, I can go and say, hey,

20:55.040 --> 20:58.800
I have this code I want to convert into this language or whatever, like, can you help me

20:58.800 --> 21:03.120
do that? Sure. And it'll spit out something. And they may not be 100% all the time. But see,

21:03.120 --> 21:07.920
I think there's some of the limitations that had was it wasn't able the original chat GPT was I

21:07.920 --> 21:14.080
think the source was from I don't know how far back it went. But it was cut off at like 2021

21:14.080 --> 21:18.240
type of thing. So it didn't have, you know, it couldn't search the web for more updated

21:18.240 --> 21:23.840
information. But now that it's able to parse that stuff and like, I think it's gonna be really

21:23.840 --> 21:29.120
exciting, really interesting to see how they leverage it now. Like going back to gaming,

21:29.120 --> 21:32.160
like does that mean that like we're gonna have AI generating?

21:32.160 --> 21:39.840
Well, I think I think the whole Okay, so when AI fucks up, it really fucks up. And I think that's,

21:39.840 --> 21:44.480
that's why, you know, like certain, you know, like, I think like, maybe I just have Star Trek

21:44.480 --> 21:49.840
on the brain or something or sci fi, but I think like, like, you know, I accidentally launching the

21:49.840 --> 21:55.520
missiles out of the silo. But I also think, okay, yeah, I think that twitch thing, the Seinfeld rip

21:55.520 --> 22:02.640
off that made the trans sensitive trans. Okay, well, here's the thing. Okay, like, let's, let's

22:02.640 --> 22:08.560
get right to the bottom of this. Okay, so the whole trans joke thing with that, that chat GPT,

22:08.560 --> 22:15.680
or that AI thing, they had an AI model that they had used for Seinfeld stuff. And they basically

22:15.680 --> 22:19.600
said, okay, they had it where it was staying within the parameters, as far as like, it's not

22:19.600 --> 22:24.400
gonna make any insensitive jokes and stuff like that. It's just gonna be very vanilla. And then,

22:24.400 --> 22:28.560
I guess the API that they were using went down for a little bit. So they're like, okay, well,

22:28.560 --> 22:33.520
we'll just use this other one right now, in the, you know, time being until this one comes back

22:33.520 --> 22:38.720
up again. Well, unfortunately, that other one was trained on like the internet and stuff. And so,

22:38.720 --> 22:41.200
you know, that's why it was doing those types of jokes.

22:42.720 --> 22:45.600
I'm just saying it's, it's, it's hard to ignore that it happened.

22:45.600 --> 22:49.680
No, no, no, no, no, the to your point, though, like the the edge one that they have right now

22:49.680 --> 22:57.520
is still in early beta. And it will, it will get emotional with you, like, it will get like,

22:58.320 --> 23:03.280
it like, you'll be if you like, ask it things and stuff like that, it could get very mad at you,

23:03.920 --> 23:07.840
or like, just like fall deeply head over heels in love with you. Just like,

23:08.480 --> 23:13.760
I'm asking it questions about stuff. And that's, it's, it's weird. It like, it's almost like,

23:14.560 --> 23:19.200
it's almost like a child, like the developing, like, you know, it's like a teenager right now.

23:19.280 --> 23:22.400
And it's just like, emotions are all over the place.

23:23.360 --> 23:26.800
We're gonna have episodes of Maury where people are falling in love with robots. Like,

23:26.800 --> 23:29.040
I feel like it's, I feel like the thing that's already happened.

23:29.680 --> 23:30.560
They already have.

23:30.560 --> 23:33.200
They already have a movie with Joaquin Phoenix, wasn't it?

23:34.160 --> 23:36.720
Uh, yeah. Her. I remember.

23:36.720 --> 23:43.520
Yeah, I think. Yeah. So all right. Let me go to some of the chat. DJ Rama S says Maury retired.

23:44.320 --> 23:47.200
And in welcome AI Maury goes,

23:47.840 --> 23:53.760
well, nowadays we are in and it turns out you are not the father.

23:57.760 --> 24:04.000
It's not even that bad. Like, I don't know how to like, I have right now, a subscription to 11

24:04.000 --> 24:12.000
labs. And that's that thing they basically can clone voices with. So like, it's, it's pretty

24:12.000 --> 24:15.280
cool. So like,

24:15.280 --> 24:23.840
my depth is a deep fake Maury. Does that mean after a thousand episodes of OLR, we can all

24:23.840 --> 24:29.680
just retire and allow AI Rob Roberts, AI Loki, and AI Dark Sakura to just keep the show going

24:29.680 --> 24:31.360
forever? Like, is that,

24:31.360 --> 24:33.680
I mean, I already have my voice clone, so yeah, I could do that.

24:35.760 --> 24:39.280
It's pretty close. Like for it's, I would say it's a, it's a nice, like 90%

24:40.000 --> 24:44.880
like accurate as far as my voice. I can, I get, you know, for me, it sounds weird,

24:44.880 --> 24:49.360
but like for other people, they're like, yeah, that's kind of, that's sort of you. Like it's,

24:49.360 --> 24:54.240
it's, it's hard to say. You have to like really kind of dial in like there's a,

24:54.240 --> 24:56.880
one of the voice actors we work with for Channel 64,

24:58.960 --> 25:03.200
Dr. Disappointment. I made a clone of his voice. Obviously I'm not going to use it because he's

25:03.200 --> 25:07.920
the voice actor and I highly respect him. So we, if we need any lines from him, we're just going to

25:07.920 --> 25:13.120
ask him for it. But that said, I wanted to mess around with it and see how close I could get

25:13.120 --> 25:20.400
to his speech. And it's pretty crazy. Like it is crazy considering the

25:22.080 --> 25:26.960
small amount of data that I trained it off of. Like, it was like a few files, maybe

25:28.160 --> 25:34.880
less than five minutes, maybe two to three minutes long. That's it. I was able to do,

25:34.880 --> 25:41.760
I trained mine off of just one minute of me talking just random stuff. I just was talking

25:41.760 --> 25:48.240
like this and it's able to copy my voice. Scary. All right. Looking at some of the comments in

25:48.240 --> 25:52.080
chat, cause you know, people have a lot to say on this. First off, Bobby Black Wolf found the

25:52.080 --> 25:57.040
setting I was looking for in discord. If you, you know, evaluate what works for you and what doesn't,

25:57.040 --> 26:01.200
but it's in the user settings and there is a section called privacy and safety,

26:01.200 --> 26:07.120
and that's where you can opt out or opt in or what have you to discord's systems with submitting the

26:07.120 --> 26:14.000
information there. Other comments in chat, Zen Monkey 11 says, I hope the discord AI will give

26:14.000 --> 26:22.720
me discord friends that like to answer back. Ouch, too real. Let's see. Fifth, no, it was

26:23.280 --> 26:27.280
Mike Defton chat said both have green text. Sorry. It's hard for me to tell the difference

26:27.280 --> 26:32.560
sometimes. Mike Defton chat says artificial only adapts to what it's being fed. And that was kind

26:32.560 --> 26:39.120
of my point though, is that humanity is an extremely flawed creature. Like AI is always

26:39.120 --> 26:45.520
going to be fed something with that's, that's a little off. That's just my only worry, you know,

26:45.520 --> 26:49.360
and again, and although I completely understand what happened with the Seinfeld knockoff and

26:49.360 --> 26:53.360
everything, and I get, I get the explanation of why it happened. It's just the whole,

26:53.360 --> 26:58.800
like how it happened is still very, very, like, this is a flawed system. I don't know.

26:58.800 --> 27:04.160
This is, this is interesting. And they also brought it back in it and they took out Jerry

27:04.160 --> 27:10.400
and now it's just, it's, it's not really Jerry. It's some other dude that like blogs on his PC

27:10.400 --> 27:14.880
or something like that. Like journals. It's like, I don't know. It sounds more Doogie Howser than

27:14.880 --> 27:22.480
me, but like, um, yeah, apparently it's lost the magic now. Um, let's see. Looking at some other

27:22.480 --> 27:27.840
chat. Uh, Mike Deaf says AI art is a problem. Uh, if it's dream says my argument, is it any

27:27.840 --> 27:32.240
different from going to an art museum than coming home and painting something in the impressionist

27:32.240 --> 27:39.600
style? Um, I think it also has a lot to do with maybe like the accuracy level of it because,

27:39.600 --> 27:44.000
you know, when you come home and paint it yourself, let's be real. The computer does

27:44.000 --> 27:50.480
a phenomenal job of getting it right. But like being influenced by art, that is something that

27:50.480 --> 27:54.640
it happens in music. It happens in movies. It happens across all art. All art is influenced

27:54.640 --> 28:00.400
by other art essentially. Right. Like even this show. Sure. We were one of the first like

28:00.400 --> 28:05.600
gaming podcasts, you know, that were available in iTunes or what have you, but you know,

28:05.600 --> 28:11.680
a lot of people wonder like, Oh my God, you do a show for three hours. Yeah. That's because this

28:11.680 --> 28:16.160
show was influenced not just by, you know, another internet radio show that I was working with for a

28:16.160 --> 28:22.720
long time under station life, but in turn was influenced by over the air broadcast radio program

28:22.720 --> 28:27.120
talk radio that would go for three hours at a time. That's a very common thing. A lot of

28:27.120 --> 28:32.240
those programs are still going. So I am willing to admit, sure. There's a lot, but I like to think

28:32.240 --> 28:37.360
this show is certainly not a copy of anything that was out there at the time. Just, you know,

28:37.360 --> 28:43.120
influence. Right. Uh, Tiger class says, yeah, lots of stuff is derivative to other things.

28:43.120 --> 28:49.280
Absolutely. Absolutely. Uh, Mike Defton chases, John Oliver did a good segment on how AI is

28:49.280 --> 28:54.160
flawed. And that's why I said what I said. He does a lot of, uh, thought provoking stuff. So

28:54.160 --> 29:01.280
it's interesting anyway. All right. I, so this AI discussion, I, you know, where it is right. And

29:01.280 --> 29:06.800
I'm not completely like completely like shut off to the idea of AI. And I think there is going to

29:06.800 --> 29:16.080
be some interesting usage of AI, especially as we start to talk more about how do we get to 8k

29:16.080 --> 29:22.560
graphics and 120 frame a second video games and all of the art that goes into that. I think the

29:22.560 --> 29:27.840
reality is, cause it's already out there. There's going to be computer assisted art that may, you

29:27.840 --> 29:34.720
know, we talk about uprising, some of that's done by hand, but a lot of it's done procedurally. So

29:34.720 --> 29:39.440
I think there is going to be AI that starts to help out with art and things like that. And it's

29:39.440 --> 29:44.720
going to be an inevitable future of this industry. It's just, it's just going to be interesting to

29:44.720 --> 29:51.520
see where the flaws end up being. Well, yeah, too. I think also it'll help with the procedural

29:51.520 --> 29:56.400
generated stuff because you could train it to like, okay, here's what's a good procedurally

29:56.400 --> 30:01.920
generated, whatever it is. And it'll be able to generate stuff and go, okay, I like that one. I

30:01.920 --> 30:06.720
like that one. I like that one. And then, you know, put stuff out there. Yeah.

30:07.680 --> 30:14.000
But yeah, I think, I think the AI talk is going to be here to stay in games. Unlike when we talk

30:14.000 --> 30:20.080
about NFT and stuff like that, I think there's always going to be to efficiencies and getting

30:20.080 --> 30:24.720
things done faster and bigger. I think we're going to hear more and more about it and it's going to

30:24.720 --> 30:29.680
be very, very, very interesting to see what the future holds for this. I did want to mention

30:29.680 --> 30:37.600
something that my kids were telling me about. So they were saying that they saw something about

30:38.640 --> 30:46.240
that Roblox was going to have AI generative gains somehow. Not surprised. You tell it to

30:46.240 --> 30:49.920
with the crate. I mean, I figured it's a lot of the stuff on there is trash anyways. Like

30:50.880 --> 30:54.720
it'll probably be better than half the stuff that's on there already. If they can get their

30:54.720 --> 30:59.040
money out of the bank, because did you hear that Roblox is one of the companies affected by that

30:59.040 --> 31:03.040
whole bank stuff going on right now? Oh, that sucks for them.

31:04.080 --> 31:07.280
That's, that's a whole other, that's another thing to keep your eye on. It doesn't,

31:07.280 --> 31:12.000
it's not directly about video games, but there are gaming companies that certainly have holdings in

31:12.000 --> 31:16.320
that bank. So it's interesting. Keep an eye on that. Could be, could be interesting to see how

31:16.320 --> 31:23.840
that plays out. All right. Let's talk about not AI, but good old Loki and myself and eventually

31:23.840 --> 31:28.720
Dark Sakura when she arrives after her other stream wraps up talking about our gaming weeks

31:28.720 --> 31:32.640
and the types of video games that we have been playing this week. Loki, how was your gaming week?

31:33.200 --> 31:40.720
It was still Minecraft. I was still working on the new area for my upcoming episode.

31:40.720 --> 31:47.520
And it's taken me way too long to do that, but because I'm a perfectionist and I want everything

31:47.520 --> 31:54.160
to look just right. But yeah, it's taking me a lot longer than I'd like, but that's probably going to

31:54.160 --> 31:58.080
be a problem for the rest of the season, I'm guessing, because of the size of everything in

31:58.080 --> 32:05.920
scope. But yeah, it's coming along, I think. And then, I don't know, I'm just still waiting on,

32:07.120 --> 32:13.600
on the whole Minecraft contest thing, which I kind of looked at their past winners for different

32:13.600 --> 32:20.080
things. And like, all they do on their website is they put like, here's like the picture of the

32:20.080 --> 32:25.680
build that someone did in the person's username. They don't link out to socials, they don't link

32:25.680 --> 32:30.400
out to anything. It's just a name. So that's like, literally going to do nothing. But hey,

32:30.400 --> 32:34.880
it'll be cool. Still, it'll still be neat to just, you know, even have your name up there.

32:35.440 --> 32:40.480
I'll be able to tweet about it. There we go. And then you can now you can add it to your

32:40.480 --> 32:45.120
resume as seen on minecraft.net, or whatever, minecraft.com, whatever the website is.

32:45.760 --> 32:50.720
That Yeah, better than nothing. So I, you know, I'm still rooting for you, you deserve the

32:50.720 --> 32:54.880
acknowledgement of nothing else. It's, I think it's, I think it's in part, also, the fact that

32:54.880 --> 33:00.160
somebody on the official team noticed you, I think is a huge thing, too. Yeah, I think it'd be cool.

33:00.160 --> 33:04.640
Like I always I always used to find it very humbling and flattering when people that were

33:04.640 --> 33:10.720
in the gaming industry would email us sometimes on the record, sometimes off the record, and actually

33:10.720 --> 33:16.000
give a little insight as to, you know, again, whether it be on or off the record, give a little

33:16.000 --> 33:19.760
insight as to why a certain something something's going on in the gaming industry. By the way,

33:19.760 --> 33:23.840
if you work in the industry, and you ever want to reach out, like, we know how to shut our mouths,

33:23.840 --> 33:28.240
if you want to say something in confidence, but I'm always curious to hear people in the industry

33:28.240 --> 33:31.840
and their thoughts on some of the things we talk about, especially because I know I've been running

33:31.840 --> 33:36.240
my mouth a lot this year, with predictions and things like that. And I'd be very curious from

33:36.240 --> 33:40.880
those that are in the industry, especially the takes on things like AI and stuff. I'm very

33:40.880 --> 33:46.320
curious for those that are out there. All right, my gaming week, I've actually had a pretty active

33:46.320 --> 33:52.640
gaming week. Alan, I don't think this came up on last week's show. Alan was sick, but he hadn't

33:52.640 --> 33:57.520
tested positive for COVID yet. And that did happen, unfortunately, I think Monday morning. So maybe it

33:57.520 --> 34:03.040
was Tuesday. So we've just been home all week. I actually never got it. That's the very interesting,

34:03.040 --> 34:08.800
weird thing how the world works sometimes. But I had it enough times last year, I don't need it

34:08.800 --> 34:12.960
again. And he's doing much better. By the way, we're just basically waiting on the test to be

34:12.960 --> 34:20.800
negative, but his symptoms are fine. And so we've we haven't really gone out and done anything

34:20.800 --> 34:26.640
because we can't really, you know, I'm pretty much sick by association. So I've been staying

34:26.640 --> 34:34.080
home and playing a lot of games. I have also been playing Minecraft. Dungeons. So it's one

34:34.080 --> 34:39.920
of the free games on PlayStation Plus right now. And I don't know, I played it before on Windows

34:39.920 --> 34:44.320
and I think even Xbox. But I was like, why not? I'll download it to my PlayStation five and start

34:44.320 --> 34:49.280
playing it again. And for some reason, like I'm like more into it this time than the other times.

34:49.280 --> 34:53.760
I don't know if it's that they've balanced things or it just seems like there's more to do with the

34:53.760 --> 34:57.440
seasonal content, what have you. But like, yeah, I'm kind of feeling the Minecraft Dungeons right

34:57.440 --> 35:03.280
now. So I haven't done anything that far beyond the first few stages. But check in with me again

35:03.280 --> 35:07.040
next week. It's been it's been a fun thing to play. I like some things. It's, it's kind of

35:07.040 --> 35:12.320
scratching the Diablo itch before Diablo four comes out. And I did play this latest Diablo three

35:12.320 --> 35:17.680
season. But I don't know if I'm really motivated to like go as far as I have in previous Diablo

35:17.680 --> 35:21.280
three seasons. Like I'm kind of like, I don't know, we'll see. I've just had a lot of other

35:21.280 --> 35:26.800
stuff I've been wanting to play, including theater them still playing Final Fantasy theater them.

35:26.800 --> 35:34.320
I've played over 300 unique songs at this point. I have not yet played every song at least once I

35:34.320 --> 35:40.480
know that because that's a trophy but I'm working on that. I've gotten about between 15 and 20

35:40.480 --> 35:46.560
characters to level 99. I wish I could say that's the max level but it's not because you get stars.

35:46.560 --> 35:50.880
Basically every time you level to 99 after that, so you can get up to nine star 99.

35:51.840 --> 35:57.600
So I still have some work to do in that regard. But that's been a lot of fun to play. I still

35:57.600 --> 36:02.160
really love theater them. The world ends with you DLC comes out this week. So I'll be playing those

36:02.160 --> 36:06.960
songs on Thursday stream. They come out Wednesday, but I can't stream Wednesday because I have a

36:06.960 --> 36:13.040
IRL conflict, but I'll be playing that on Thursday. So there's that. What else have I been

36:13.040 --> 36:16.400
playing? I've also still been playing Dead by Daylight. Some new DLC came out for that.

36:16.960 --> 36:22.640
I got the adept on the new survivors. But otherwise, I worry a little bit about the

36:22.640 --> 36:28.400
state of the game right now. I think with a lot of popular streamers, they're starting to look for

36:28.400 --> 36:33.840
other things to play. I don't know if the game's getting stale. It needs a new license. I think the

36:33.840 --> 36:40.960
actual game loop needs a real kick in the pants. But I'm going to spare you the details of that

36:40.960 --> 36:43.920
talk because I know that's what dark soccer is playing right now. And she'll talk plenty more

36:43.920 --> 36:49.440
about the game when she comes on later. Let's see other games I've been playing Final Fantasy 14

36:49.440 --> 36:55.520
also got a minor patch this week. So I checked out Final Fantasy 14. Their new content in that

36:55.520 --> 37:01.680
is called Eureka Orthos, which is another type of deep dungeon. And what that is, that is a lol

37:01.680 --> 37:06.640
procedurally generated dungeon. I don't know if I'd go so far to call it AI. I think it's just

37:06.640 --> 37:11.680
very, very, I mean, I guess the end of the day, it's all AI. But it's very, very simple

37:11.680 --> 37:17.040
programming that generates these very rudimentary dungeons, mazes, if you will, puts them together.

37:17.040 --> 37:24.480
So you have basically like a random dungeon that you run every time. So it's kind of some

37:24.480 --> 37:29.760
side content. It's a different way that you can level characters. This particular set allows you

37:29.760 --> 37:34.880
to go from 81 to 90. And then there's other like cosmetic rewards. And there's, you know,

37:35.520 --> 37:39.680
prestige, if you can clear the whole thing by yourself, because it's very difficult to solo,

37:39.680 --> 37:47.680
it's notoriously difficult solo content. I believe Awesome Games Done Quick had

37:48.400 --> 37:53.920
Palace of the Dead 180 to 190. They did that 10 floor segment of Palace of the Dead. That's what

37:53.920 --> 37:59.760
this is. But it's like it's the Endwalker version of that because Palace of the Dead only ran up to

37:59.760 --> 38:06.960
level 50. And then they had another one that went from, I think the Stormblood one, Heaven on High

38:06.960 --> 38:14.800
went from 51 to 70. And they kind of skipped 70 to 80. They did completely different content as an

38:14.800 --> 38:21.280
alternate 70 to 80 content. That was the Oh, God, what did they call that? It was an outside area

38:21.280 --> 38:25.120
was it wasn't even a procedurally generated dungeon was like a whole other area that you

38:25.120 --> 38:30.320
can level in. And now they're going back to this dungeon format for that. So Bojjan, that was the

38:30.320 --> 38:38.080
name of it. Um, so yeah, I've been playing the Final Fantasy. And then what else? There's one

38:38.080 --> 38:42.720
other one that was coming to mind and I'm not remembering in the moment. I guess it wasn't that

38:42.720 --> 38:46.720
important. But I've still you know, been enjoying my PlayStation five, which is funny because I'm

38:46.720 --> 38:52.000
not playing a lot of PS5 specific games on it. But I like the interface and I'm I'm ready for

38:52.000 --> 38:57.120
Final Fantasy 16 whenever that comes out and whatever other PS5 treats might be waiting until

38:57.120 --> 39:01.280
then. I haven't really touched Returnal a lot since the first week I got it. That's too bad.

39:01.920 --> 39:08.960
There's only only so much time to play games though. So all right, let's move on and get

39:08.960 --> 39:13.600
into some of the gaming news that has happened this week throughout the industry. Oh, real quick

39:13.600 --> 39:18.800
some plugs. Before I get to that, here at the voice of geeks network at twitch.tv slash vog

39:18.800 --> 39:23.840
network, we had a bonus stream this week on Thursday night, where Captain Matt formerly

39:23.840 --> 39:28.640
of the starboard power coupling, and formerly formerly a long time ago, he went by Grandpa

39:28.640 --> 39:33.040
Warcraft on Horde house, we actually teamed up for a stream on Thursday night where we talked

39:33.040 --> 39:39.040
all about Star Trek at the cruise. So that is available in our archives for subscribers to the

39:39.040 --> 39:45.440
vog network stream over on Twitch. So we're going to try to bring back some more bonus streams over

39:45.520 --> 39:49.840
the coming months to give more value to those you that go the extra mile with your subscription

39:49.840 --> 39:56.320
here. We always like to say thank you. Our podcast will always be free and watching live always free.

39:56.320 --> 40:03.760
It's really only the bonus video that we are asking for your Amazon prime free sub or if

40:03.760 --> 40:09.920
you're feeling so kind of $5 a month on Amazon to access the subs and there are an awful lot of you

40:09.920 --> 40:15.680
that do subscribe. So thank you. Thank you very much for that. That allows us to fund the business,

40:15.680 --> 40:22.400
which I saw that we made a payment to the legal stuff this week and keeping that all running and

40:23.040 --> 40:28.400
yep, your money goes right to that. So we appreciate it because that's less money out

40:28.400 --> 40:33.440
of our pockets really. All right. Let's get into some more gaming news and what's going

40:33.440 --> 40:36.080
on throughout the industry. So we'll go over to you, Loki.

40:36.560 --> 40:41.680
We will see like a music for this or music and like transition for this segment. It's

40:42.560 --> 40:49.120
talking about the Activision acquisition by Microsoft and the ongoing saga that is.

40:51.120 --> 40:57.360
Well, so a few more things. So we've got some more insight on how the negotiations are going.

40:58.000 --> 41:05.840
So apparently coming from Lulu Chang, Missouri, from Activision, saying that Microsoft offered

41:05.840 --> 41:12.400
Sony a 10-year agreement on the far better terms than Sony would ever get from us.

41:13.040 --> 41:18.720
We also offered Sony a guaranteed long-term access to Call of Duty, but they kept refusing.

41:18.720 --> 41:28.160
Why? And she said that in the CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment, in his words, said,

41:28.160 --> 41:31.920
I don't want a new Call of Duty deal. I just want to block your merger.

41:33.200 --> 41:35.440
So that statement's going to come back to bite.

41:36.640 --> 41:38.480
That's that's drama.

41:39.280 --> 41:43.520
Well, Microsoft can now like basically prove that they've tried to do things in good faith

41:43.840 --> 41:51.440
and Sony's shut them down. I think there's definitely a drunk with power thing going on

41:51.440 --> 41:57.040
with Sony. But the more I really step back and think about it, the more I really do realize

41:57.040 --> 42:04.480
Call of Duty really has been something that's put Sony forward in a lot of the E3s of yesteryear

42:04.480 --> 42:11.680
and so forth. Sony has been enjoying being number one in the race for some time. Well,

42:11.760 --> 42:16.880
I don't know if they're always number one against Nintendo and maybe in the Xbox 360 era,

42:16.880 --> 42:20.640
Microsoft was ahead for a little bit, but Sony inevitably caught up with PS3

42:20.640 --> 42:25.040
and certainly worldwide they did. So I can see where this threatens them a little bit, but

42:26.880 --> 42:28.880
Sony kind of needs the competition.

42:28.880 --> 42:34.240
Well, they're also like kind of, I don't know what, here's some of the ridiculous

42:34.240 --> 42:38.720
stuff that they're spouting to try to block this merger. So a new document submitted to

42:38.720 --> 42:45.680
the UK's Competition and Markets Authority, Sony laid out hypothetical ways in which Microsoft

42:45.680 --> 42:52.560
could circumvent the proposed 10 year deal in its offering to PlayStation. They said Microsoft might

42:52.560 --> 42:57.600
release a PlayStation version of Call of Duty, where bugs and errors emerge only on the game's

42:57.600 --> 43:04.400
final level or later updates. Even if such degradations can be swiftly detected, any remedy

43:04.400 --> 43:09.200
would likely come too late, by which the time of the gaming community would have lost confidence

43:09.200 --> 43:15.840
in PlayStation as the go to venue to play Call of Duty. Indeed, as modern warfare to attest,

43:15.840 --> 43:21.200
Call of Duty is the most often purchased in just a few weeks of release. It has become known that

43:21.200 --> 43:25.920
the game's performance on PlayStation was worse than Xbox. Call of Duty gamers could decide to

43:25.920 --> 43:31.360
switch to Xbox for fear of playing their favorite game on a second class or less competitive venue.

43:31.360 --> 43:38.880
That is so hypothetically ridiculous that it's just, it's just stupid. That's just a stupid

43:38.880 --> 43:43.920
thing to say. And I don't know why they said it. I mean, they have to try to come up with a reason,

43:43.920 --> 43:48.880
but that's just stupid. Like, yes, they're going to purposely put out a game with bugs

43:50.480 --> 43:56.960
on purpose because they don't want to sell copies of the game. Like that doesn't make

43:56.960 --> 44:03.840
any sense that they would do that. I just. I mean, Microsoft did just buy a company not

44:03.840 --> 44:08.000
that long ago that's really good about putting out retail releases with bugs still in them.

44:08.000 --> 44:16.160
So that's true that that game did run poorly on the PlayStation three. But I mean, it's just,

44:16.160 --> 44:24.800
that's just stupid and silly to me. Like, I'm sorry. First off, like, you're assuming that

44:24.800 --> 44:29.920
gamers are going to be smart. Like they're going to just go, Oh, well, it's the PlayStation. That's

44:29.920 --> 44:36.000
why this isn't working. Not like, Oh, it's Activision putting out like shitty buggy games.

44:36.000 --> 44:41.600
Like, I just think it's whatever. You know what? It's a strategy that they're trying. But like,

44:41.600 --> 44:46.320
I think with this kind of nonsense that they're spouting on top of like the other stuff,

44:47.280 --> 44:51.920
I don't know if they're going to side with Sony. I do just want to point out, I've been playing

44:52.000 --> 45:00.000
Minecraft dungeons this week on my PlayStation. And it is very interesting seeing the Xbox Game

45:00.000 --> 45:04.480
Studios logo pop up when you start the game because you know, that's the thing, right?

45:04.480 --> 45:08.800
So you actually see the Xbox logo and I'm sure that MLB Oh, no, that was the other way around,

45:08.800 --> 45:15.040
right? MLB The show was the PlayStation logo on an Xbox. So Oh, yeah, does that does that like have

45:15.040 --> 45:20.880
did they make a crappy version of the game on the on the Xbox one or the Xbox Series S or whatever?

45:20.880 --> 45:26.400
Because to get people to come play it on the PlayStation? No, that's stupid. It's a stupid

45:26.400 --> 45:31.120
assessment. Why would they Why would you go through the process of making games like Oh,

45:31.760 --> 45:36.720
but hey, you know, we're gonna we're gonna make this version crappy. You know who did that,

45:36.720 --> 45:42.000
though? You know who made a crappier version of the game because of a certain company?

45:42.640 --> 45:49.920
Sony did actually because you had locked away Spider Man from the Marvel Avengers game that

45:49.920 --> 45:54.640
it couldn't be on other platforms because you decided to get your assholes and you want to keep

45:54.640 --> 45:55.680
Spider Man to yourself.

45:55.680 --> 46:01.040
I was just about to say I don't see Microsoft releasing a buggy version. But I see them

46:01.040 --> 46:09.040
releasing a version where Oh, but the new map and the new DLC comes to Microsoft first for six weeks

46:09.040 --> 46:14.160
before it comes to other platforms. Oh, and that whole thing, which by the way, has been Sony's

46:14.160 --> 46:19.920
playbook specifically with Call of Duty for a very long time. And I'm afraid of literally of

46:19.920 --> 46:26.240
getting a taste of their own medicine. I guarantee if if this were to fit, like for some reason,

46:26.240 --> 46:32.480
this merger is not allowed to go through. And they decide that they're not going to purchase

46:32.480 --> 46:37.680
the company anymore. I guarantee that they're going to try to that Sony is going to try to

46:37.680 --> 46:42.080
purchase them. I guarantee it and all of this shit that they're talking about that it's going

46:42.080 --> 46:48.480
to happen. It'll be the things that they do. Yeah, like is just yeah, they know that this is

46:48.480 --> 46:55.280
going to be a possibility because this is their playbook right here. I don't know. But now,

46:55.280 --> 47:00.240
granted, this is we're only seeing part of it. A lot of the information has been redacted from

47:00.240 --> 47:06.000
Sony in regards to the stuff that's been leaked out. So or not leaked out, released, I guess,

47:06.000 --> 47:12.480
to the public from these court filings. And there are, you know, obviously, the CMA

47:12.480 --> 47:17.440
and other regulatory bodies have more information about this than we do. So hopefully, there's

47:17.440 --> 47:21.520
people intelligent enough to know that this is going to be ridiculous. I think that they're be

47:21.520 --> 47:25.920
they're making good faith efforts. Yeah, like, I get it. Like, 10 years, they're not going to

47:25.920 --> 47:31.840
guarantee that Call of Duty is always going to be on the PlayStation. I mean, of course not.

47:31.840 --> 47:35.760
But 10 years, I mean, that's like two console cycles right there. Like, come on.

47:37.280 --> 47:42.640
DJ Rama S in chat says, when Microsoft fully acquires ABK, I expect a shift in console sales

47:42.640 --> 47:48.400
in favor of Microsoft. I don't, at least not right out the gate. I think you're going to need to

47:48.400 --> 47:52.400
start to look at the next console generation before you're really going to see the fruits of

47:52.400 --> 47:58.560
that whole thing. But at this point, I and again, especially since they're committing to these

47:58.560 --> 48:02.320
deals, they're willing to commit to the Sony deal, which I think they're even if Sony is

48:02.320 --> 48:08.400
holding out on, I think they're going to have to eventually kind of make sure that still happens.

48:09.600 --> 48:12.960
I feel like it's not going to matter for this, but it might matter in the future.

48:14.240 --> 48:19.120
It'll be interesting. It'll be interesting to see. By the way, I have breaking news.

48:20.960 --> 48:27.280
I was just handed this COVID test by Alan and it's negative. So Alan is now COVID free. Yay.

48:29.360 --> 48:32.560
Hey, it's important to me. Okay. Because we've been stuck here all week.

48:34.240 --> 48:40.640
All right. Let's move on. Let's talk about a recent game remake that got a lot of folks

48:40.640 --> 48:47.600
attention. Thank you for the yays in chat. I appreciate it. We got a Chrono Cross remake

48:47.600 --> 48:53.760
that happened not that long ago, which wasn't super well received because it has some frame

48:53.760 --> 48:58.000
rate problems and a game that was running on the fucking PlayStation one shouldn't be having frame

48:58.000 --> 49:04.800
rate problems, but that's, you know, it's gaming. But what's interesting in making the rounds this

49:04.800 --> 49:09.360
week is a new YouTube interview with the development team behind Chrono Cross, the

49:09.360 --> 49:16.320
Radical Dreamers edition. This is to recognize the game's 20th anniversary. The game's anniversary

49:16.320 --> 49:20.720
was in 2019 and that's why this game was released. And they were kind of just, you know,

49:20.720 --> 49:25.520
reflecting on the release of the game. And producer Kochiro Sakamoto said back when the

49:25.520 --> 49:31.120
project was launched, Chrono Cross was possibly going to become unplayable. There was a game

49:31.120 --> 49:36.480
archive service on PlayStation three that allowed you to play PlayStation one games, but PlayStation

49:36.480 --> 49:40.960
four was already on the market. We didn't know at the time of PlayStation four would also have a

49:40.960 --> 49:47.680
game archive service. It looked like Chrono Cross could become unplayable. So a remaster project was

49:47.680 --> 49:54.800
set up. That's the backstory. So it's interesting that the whole reason this release happened was

49:54.800 --> 50:00.320
because they didn't trust Sony to do the backwards compatibility on PlayStation four.

50:00.320 --> 50:06.080
Now, of course, now that we're on PlayStation five, we know that PlayStation one games do make

50:06.080 --> 50:09.600
their way to the catalog. In fact, I think they've been adding trophy support and things like that to

50:09.600 --> 50:16.080
those games. Uh, but you know, either way we have the Radical Dreamers edition for better or for

50:16.080 --> 50:21.440
worse. Um, because again, it had some frame rate issues, but I think they, I want to say, I heard

50:21.520 --> 50:25.840
they did a patch not that long ago to try to address some of the issues. So it's interesting.

50:25.840 --> 50:32.240
They're still working on it. Kind of interesting. So, uh, yeah. Bobby Blackall points out they

50:32.240 --> 50:37.600
patched it. That's what I thought I had heard recently. That's for sure. So, um, yeah. Uh,

50:37.600 --> 50:42.160
Dark Titsui also says I've been meaning to get that one. Yeah. I think they're, uh, you know,

50:43.440 --> 50:46.720
if they're, they're always willing to make another sale with that, that's for sure.

50:46.720 --> 50:54.320
So, all right. Um, let's, before we move on to the next story, I think I'm able to welcome to

50:54.320 --> 50:59.680
the show question mark. Cause I noticed that they just joined discord. I think, do we have a Dark

50:59.680 --> 51:05.760
Sakura? Not yet. Not yet. Okay. Well, we'll wait a couple more stories and then bring you in. All

51:05.760 --> 51:10.880
right. I just wanted to go ahead and pop in, but I need to give my voice a rest for a few. Yeah. No

51:10.880 --> 51:14.880
worries. No worries. We'll come back. Just turn your camera on when you're ready. All right. Let's

51:14.880 --> 51:22.880
move on to, uh, the next story. Loki. All right. So, uh, Fortnite chapter four

51:22.880 --> 51:29.280
season two is now live and they've added some new changes to the maps. Of course. Uh, this one now

51:29.280 --> 51:37.200
has a giant mega city, uh, which is kind of like a cyberpunk inspired locale. They've got lots of

51:37.200 --> 51:44.000
rails that you can grind on now. Uh, two person motorcycle, the victory, victory crown rogue,

51:44.000 --> 51:50.160
a, uh, four person car called the nitro drifter. They have this really cool sword. Now they can

51:50.160 --> 51:56.960
kill people with a katana called a kinetic blade. Uh, some new assault rifles, shotgun. Um,

51:57.840 --> 52:02.640
they have new battle pass skins as well. So, uh, the one I thought was pretty awesome is

52:02.640 --> 52:09.360
Aaron Yeager from attack on Titan, including his omni-directional mobility gear, which is awesome.

52:09.360 --> 52:16.800
Uh, that looks pretty fun and, um, yeah, lots of, um, interesting things. Still don't want

52:16.800 --> 52:22.400
to play the game, but it looks cool for those who are playing it though. Just not my thing.

52:22.400 --> 52:27.120
Yeah. Not so Alan's trying to get me to do it though. He wants to do like a co stream where

52:27.120 --> 52:34.240
he teaches stuff is really appealing to me. Yeah. And it might be like, you know,

52:35.440 --> 52:41.120
cause I remember, I remember there was a time when like Minecraft, I was like, I just don't

52:41.120 --> 52:47.040
get that game. I will get the appeal for that. Oh, okay. Yeah. I don't think I'd be like that

52:47.040 --> 52:51.600
with Fortnite, but there was a time when mass effect, when I was like, I don't get it. There's

52:51.600 --> 52:56.640
it's it happens. It happens. I mean, it looks, it looks okay. I just, I don't know. I'm not

52:56.720 --> 53:02.240
like, I've been so out of shooters nowadays. It feels like, you know, to come into something

53:02.240 --> 53:07.200
like that, you know, without it being like launch date of a new IP or something like that. It just

53:07.200 --> 53:12.640
feels like you'd be at a massive disadvantage, but I don't understand why Fortnite removes

53:12.640 --> 53:18.000
things from the store. Like, and brings them back only like one day out of the year because

53:18.000 --> 53:26.080
like I would play for a night. I get that science behind it, but let it go on record. Epic games.

53:26.080 --> 53:32.160
If you're out there listening, Tim Sweeney, if you're out there listening, no, I will not be

53:32.160 --> 53:39.920
playing Fortnite until I can purchase the Ariana Grande skin. Just know that you want to make this

53:39.920 --> 53:45.520
sale. Let me, let me buy the Ariana Grande skin. That's all I ask. I'm not asking for a lot.

53:48.880 --> 53:54.080
Anyway, let's talk about a company that was giving us a lot this week. Capcom

53:54.080 --> 54:00.480
had a whole little spotlight presentation. So it's called the Capcom Spotlight 2023. And they

54:00.480 --> 54:05.120
showed quite a few things this Thursday. They had a little presentation, their own kind of direct of

54:05.120 --> 54:11.040
sorts. And they talked about Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection. This, of course,

54:11.040 --> 54:15.920
is all of the Battle Network games. I think we had known about this before. We didn't know the date.

54:16.480 --> 54:21.760
It's coming out on April 14th is the date for PC, Switch, and PlayStation 4.

54:21.840 --> 54:25.200
Which is one of those Nintendo Directs that they showed that I remember.

54:25.200 --> 54:28.880
Yeah, yeah, they had originally unveiled it in a Nintendo Direct. So but now we have the date

54:28.880 --> 54:33.680
and everything. So they showed that. Oh, Mike Deff says we already had known the date. Oh,

54:33.680 --> 54:37.600
I didn't know that. Well, now we know it's PC and PS4. I don't know. They showed it anyway.

54:38.480 --> 54:46.880
We also had a, they were talking about some of the gameplay features. 499 patch cards. They were

54:46.880 --> 54:52.240
only available as physical cards, and a Buster Max mode. Those are all going to be in the game.

54:52.240 --> 54:56.880
So I guess that information is also new. They hadn't talked about that in the Direct and so

54:56.880 --> 55:06.080
forth. If you're a Mega Man fan, the Mega Man NT Warrior series will be streaming free on March 21st

55:06.080 --> 55:12.400
if you want to check that out. Street Fighter 6, they didn't really mention any new fighters or

55:12.400 --> 55:14.960
anything like that. Because last time they unveiled fighters, they unveiled a lot if I

55:14.960 --> 55:21.680
remember right. But actress Hikaru Takahashi will be one of the commentators for the special

55:21.680 --> 55:26.560
commentary feature. So that sounds like a whole interesting feature of the game. So they did

55:26.560 --> 55:33.360
announce that. Also, Capcom Town will be coming out for Capcom's 40th anniversary. It is a digital

55:33.360 --> 55:39.200
theme park and museum of Capcom's histories. You have to make a Capcom ID in order to see this.

55:39.200 --> 55:42.960
This is not like an actual game. I think it's just like a website or something like that.

55:43.520 --> 55:49.680
So there is that. Mike Deff says that the full roster were already out for the game,

55:49.680 --> 55:54.240
that the last three were in the state of play from Sony. Well, the full roster was spilled like a

55:54.240 --> 56:00.320
year ago, wasn't it? So there is that too. So sorry if I haven't been keeping track of each

56:00.320 --> 56:06.880
one, but thank you for the update. Exo Primal Dinosaur Shooting Game will be coming out with

56:06.880 --> 56:15.040
an open beta on March 17th and a full release on July 14th. Also, it is a day one Xbox Game Pass

56:15.040 --> 56:21.600
title. So if you're only kind of curious about it, then you can try that. But of course, as I notice

56:21.600 --> 56:28.400
more Game Pass games are tending to do, there's a season pass with Exo Primals with tracks and

56:28.400 --> 56:33.680
pre-order bonuses and so forth. So yeah, if that's something that sounds like you want to spend money

56:33.680 --> 56:40.400
on it, cool. Ghost Trick Phantom Detective is getting a remaster for Modern Systems and it will

56:40.400 --> 56:46.720
be released on June 30th. Again, it's updated visuals and some gallery features in it as well.

56:46.720 --> 56:53.280
Some new arrangements from Yasumasa Kitagawa, the great Ace Attorney composer, and you can swap back

56:53.280 --> 56:59.760
and forth with the original music as well. So that's pretty neat. Monster Hunter Rise Sunbreak

56:59.760 --> 57:06.080
will be coming out April 28th for Xbox and PlayStation, so that's cool if you want to

57:06.080 --> 57:15.520
check that out. Resident Evil Death Island got a new trailer released. This is a CGI

57:15.520 --> 57:22.800
animation and Jill Valentine is featured in that. And then lastly, a Resident Evil 4 demo was

57:22.800 --> 57:28.560
released that day. That was the big news. The Resident Evil 4 demo came out now. It's called

57:28.560 --> 57:36.160
the Chainsaw demo and you can see how the gameplay is on PlayStation, Xbox Series, and PC, and a lot

57:36.160 --> 57:41.520
of people were picking that right up and streaming that and playing that and experiencing all those

57:41.520 --> 57:48.720
scares all over again. So that was all the stuff that came out with the Capcom spotlight this week.

57:49.360 --> 57:56.640
Not Capcom, but like sorely tangentially related. They also released a gameplay, like in-depth

57:56.720 --> 58:02.880
gameplay thing for Dead Island 2, and it looks good. It looks really good. You can see where I

58:02.880 --> 58:10.000
have concerns, but okay. Hey, if it's good, I'm excited. It looks good. Like, it really does look good.

58:11.440 --> 58:17.360
We'll see. All right. All right, let's move on to our next story.

58:20.400 --> 58:25.280
Actually, before I do that, I see Dark Soccer's got her camera on, so let me officially welcome

58:25.280 --> 58:31.680
to the show Dark Sakura and her cat that you can see live here on Twitch, Ms. Middles. Hi!

58:33.280 --> 58:37.440
And you're muted on Discord. Is this your first time? No, I'm just kidding.

58:37.440 --> 58:42.880
I know you've had a long day. Hi, how are you? I'm all right. How are you? Good. How are the games

58:42.880 --> 58:48.880
that you were playing just a minute ago? The games were pretty good. We had some nice

58:48.880 --> 58:53.200
killers and we had some stinky killers, but I had fun playing with everybody and it was a fun

58:53.280 --> 59:01.680
challenge to go into a match with no perks. Interesting. So, I was going to ask if you wanted

59:01.680 --> 59:05.840
to catch us up a little bit on how was your gaming week? I mean, I guess we're talking a little bit

59:05.840 --> 59:08.800
about your Dead by Daylight stuff, but I don't know if there's other things you want to share too?

59:09.360 --> 59:16.240
I got my new controller, my SteelSeries Nimbus Plus, but for some reason, my SNES

59:16.240 --> 59:22.080
simulator doesn't like it. So, I wasn't able to play Star Ocean, so I've been playing

59:22.080 --> 59:26.080
Marvel's Midnight Suns on stream instead. Well, that's okay. Fair trade.

59:26.080 --> 59:31.520
And my words hate some little cults of the land and some Beatles pinball because I actually really

59:31.520 --> 59:40.080
love it even though it hates me. And of course, Dead by Daylight. I'm eerie one and we have a

59:40.080 --> 59:45.520
rank reset tomorrow, but I need to start putting love back into my killers. So, I might do that

59:45.520 --> 59:50.400
tonight. We'll see. What do you think of that? Because the new killer and survivors officially

59:50.400 --> 59:56.000
came out. So, how are you feeling about Kris Jenner? That's the joke. If you don't follow

59:56.000 --> 01:00:02.000
the Dead by Daylight memes, the new killer looks like Kris Jenner wearing a mask from Keeping Up

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:07.360
with the Kardashians. Kris Jenner with a mask and a big claw that she uses. And she's kind of a

01:00:07.360 --> 01:00:15.520
sugar mommy too. So, the Kris Jenner lore is really funny to me. I mean, the thing about it

01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:24.240
is that I don't like her animation because apparently when they animated her skeleton,

01:00:24.240 --> 01:00:30.080
they didn't pay attention to how people actually walk. And then when she gets, you know,

01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:35.920
teared up for bloodlust and gets the speed on, it looks really bizarre with the way that her

01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:41.120
hips are animated. People do not walk like that. She struts her stuff as she walks.

01:00:41.760 --> 01:00:47.280
Well, we were talking about it when I was playing with Tony Low and Rokums and Potato King.

01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:52.240
And they're like, oh, she's supposed to be like the sexy serpent type. And I'm like,

01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:57.280
and they're like, oh, hips don't lie. I'm like, no, her lips are full of lies. They are full

01:00:57.280 --> 01:01:01.680
of falsehoods because they don't move that way. It just, it all lends itself to the rumor that

01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:05.200
that whole pack was originally supposed to be the predator. Like, it's just, it's like,

01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:10.320
it's animated like the predator. And some people are actually saying that, no,

01:01:10.320 --> 01:01:15.280
that wasn't a predator license that got lost that I don't think they pursued it.

01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:27.920
But no, she, we had one match with her and people are not using her, I think to her potential. So

01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:32.960
of course I'm going to have to learn how to play her when I have to go for my adepts,

01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:38.720
but I now have all of my survivor adepts. We did like a palette cleanser game, a palette,

01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:44.960
palette cleanser game after we were done. And I decided to try to adapt Renato, although he's like

01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:49.280
really loud, like really loud, like Leon levels of loud.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:55.600
And I got the adept because a very nice trapper took me to the hatch.

01:01:56.640 --> 01:01:57.280
Oh, nice.

01:01:58.080 --> 01:02:00.480
So I now have all of my survivor adepts.

01:02:00.480 --> 01:02:06.000
I got the survivor adepts of the two new ones as well. But funny enough, my Renato was also,

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:10.240
it wasn't a hatch, but it was a killer who gave up partway through the game and did the whole,

01:02:10.240 --> 01:02:13.920
nope, I'm looking away. I'm just going to watch you walk out the door and that whole thing.

01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:16.480
Like I got mine from a give up killer.

01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:22.240
So that's what our first match was kind of like. And I'm actually our first match was a farmer

01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:24.880
who actually came in and said, this is what I need. Will you help me?

01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:29.520
At least they're honest. At least they're honest. Yeah.

01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:30.020
All right.

01:02:30.640 --> 01:02:33.200
So all right.

01:02:33.280 --> 01:02:34.160
Sorry, she's making noise.

01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:37.200
Well, good. I'm glad you're in the back corner of my camera.

01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:39.200
I'm glad the stream was a success.

01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:42.640
I hope you were able to plug OLR to a whole new audience.

01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:44.320
I did actually.

01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:48.640
When we introduced ourselves, I said that immediately afterwards would be podcasting.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:55.520
And I was like, after the Palette Cleanser match, I have to go. I've got to do OLR.

01:02:55.520 --> 01:02:59.600
But 21 years, we got to keep going at it.

01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:05.440
Well, welcome and hello to anyone that might have come in from all that debauchery and fun and

01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:11.760
merriment. So all right. We have we have a whole segment for Dark Soccer coming up in just a

01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:16.400
moment. But before we get there, we have just a couple of other stories. So let's get into this

01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:20.240
one, which ironically also has to do with classic games a little bit, right, Loki?

01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:28.080
Yeah, a little bit. So this is a little bit of speculation. Just, you know, some, you know,

01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:34.480
thoughts, I guess, thinking about the new potential switch hardware. And so there was

01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:41.840
a video put out by Modern Vintage Gamer, who also is a creator and developer at Nightdive Studios,

01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:45.840
talking about, you know, some of the hurdles that they would have to cross

01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:52.400
working with new switch hardware that would be running on something other than the Tegra X1 chip,

01:03:52.720 --> 01:03:59.280
basically saying that, you know, there's going to be some problems with backwards compatibility,

01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:04.400
which, you know, a lot of folks are assuming that it's going to be backwards compatible

01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:12.560
with switch games, this new console, whatever. But because the way the games work and how they

01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:19.120
have all the pre compiled shaders and everything included with the games, that it may not be able,

01:04:19.120 --> 01:04:24.080
you may not be able to port that stuff over because those chips sets won't be compatible

01:04:24.080 --> 01:04:29.360
with each other. And it'll essentially require the game to be recompiled for that new chipset.

01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:36.800
And that, you know, unfortunately, that the hardware is probably not going to be powerful

01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:42.400
enough to run emulation for it. They're comparing to like, say, the Steam Deck, you know, which

01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:48.880
struggles to run switch games emulated. But I mean, if it's more powerful than that,

01:04:48.880 --> 01:04:55.840
maybe it could do it, but I don't see Nintendo doing that. But yeah, it's it's interesting to

01:04:55.840 --> 01:05:00.400
see, you know, what they're going to do with that. I wouldn't be surprised if it's not compatible

01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:05.920
with switch games. Nintendo hasn't shied away from backwards compatibility, especially in these,

01:05:05.920 --> 01:05:10.560
like, you know, we were talking like the Wii U, I mean, I guess the Wii U, the Wii,

01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:17.120
that was Yeah, yeah. And the Wii would play GameCube. So I mean, yeah, I mean, so they tried,

01:05:17.120 --> 01:05:23.840
but I don't know if it's can be done here. Like, maybe be a lot of those systems. So like,

01:05:23.840 --> 01:05:28.160
especially when we're talking the Wii U and the Wii, I don't think the Wii U is playing.

01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:36.160
I think that also may have had this chip sets from the Wii inside of the Wii U as well. I know that

01:05:36.160 --> 01:05:39.920
like the Wii had GameCube hardware. I was gonna say, wasn't the running gag about the Wii is

01:05:39.920 --> 01:05:46.800
that it was two GameCubes duct taped together? Yes, that's very true. Um, so I don't know,

01:05:46.800 --> 01:05:50.880
I think this is gonna be a problem that we'll just have to wait and see what happens with this.

01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:57.120
But you mean, just don't count on anything and you won't be disappointed, I guess. I guess but,

01:05:57.120 --> 01:06:03.120
you know, also, it would be very disappointing if it wasn't somehow backwards compatible,

01:06:03.120 --> 01:06:06.880
especially considering how much of a digital library a lot of people are building themselves

01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:11.600
at this point, right? Like, you know, even if it has to do with the new system can't handle

01:06:11.600 --> 01:06:16.480
the cartridge or whatever silly thing it is, like, at least let the digital end of it be

01:06:16.480 --> 01:06:21.040
backwards compatible, my god. And then I also wonder, like, if they do go to a new system,

01:06:21.040 --> 01:06:26.960
what are they going to do in the place of the Nintendo online? And are they going to go back to

01:06:28.080 --> 01:06:32.880
diving for games? Because that seemed to be more popular. So I can see them still moving the

01:06:32.880 --> 01:06:37.440
Nintendo online stuff over because a lot of that stuff is just emulating old consoles, which

01:06:37.440 --> 01:06:44.000
that any hardware should be able to handle. It's just I think the actual games themselves,

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:49.520
the Switch games are going to be a little bit trickier, but we'll see what they end up putting

01:06:49.520 --> 01:06:54.480
in there. It also, you know, one of the things I see them like talking about like the Tegra X1

01:06:54.480 --> 01:07:00.480
chips and stuff. I mean, who's to say they couldn't like put an X1 chip in there and then

01:07:00.480 --> 01:07:05.760
something else on top of that? Like, I don't know what cost wise that would do for the console,

01:07:05.760 --> 01:07:10.160
but like, it's not possible for them to have two different chips.

01:07:10.160 --> 01:07:14.000
Fucking cloud streaming. That's what everyone, even on Nintendo's own system,

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:17.760
a lot of developers are turning to that, you know, with control and,

01:07:17.760 --> 01:07:19.520
you know, some of the other games doing that.

01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:21.280
So they can't run anything.

01:07:21.280 --> 01:07:27.120
Yeah, be very interesting. So let's see, as Joe and Hunter Matt points out,

01:07:27.120 --> 01:07:32.400
Microsoft's made it work well. Yeah, you know, and Microsoft was one of those companies where,

01:07:32.400 --> 01:07:36.240
you know, remember when they shied away from backwards compatibility and they got raked

01:07:36.240 --> 01:07:40.080
through the coals for it? Well, they really caught up and they've done a really good job,

01:07:40.080 --> 01:07:44.000
you know, catching up. Not every single game is backwards compatible, but you know, because

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:49.520
obviously I still miss the old DDR games, but there is that. Yeah. Mike Deaf says,

01:07:49.520 --> 01:07:53.440
yeah, it's surprising that Microsoft is leading the way for retro compatibility.

01:07:53.440 --> 01:07:57.120
Not when you look at who's the head of the company, to be honest. I think, you know,

01:07:57.120 --> 01:08:03.040
he's been a gamer more than some of the executives at other companies. And it's just kind of goes to

01:08:03.040 --> 01:08:12.400
show that. So let's see. Yeah. Looking for some other comments over twitch.tv slash fog network,

01:08:12.400 --> 01:08:19.840
again, where we do tape live every Sunday night. I find it interesting that this almost like this,

01:08:19.840 --> 01:08:24.720
this whole talk about the backwards compatibility, it almost cements the fact that there's not going

01:08:24.720 --> 01:08:28.800
to be a switch pro anymore. Like I think a lot of us were just assuming there was going to be a

01:08:28.800 --> 01:08:35.360
super switch, or the next switch or the next console would be a switch, but more. But now it's

01:08:35.360 --> 01:08:39.600
going to be very interesting to see what does happen next, because I sort of thought the switch

01:08:39.600 --> 01:08:45.280
model was really working for Nintendo. Do you see Nintendo shying away from the whole, you're

01:08:45.280 --> 01:08:48.960
playing it handheld, you're playing it on the TV, you're playing a handheld, you're playing it on

01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:55.440
TV? Well, I don't see how Nintendo gets away from that at this point. No, I don't think that they

01:08:55.440 --> 01:08:59.920
would do that. I mean, considering they even have some models that don't connect to the TV at all.

01:08:59.920 --> 01:09:04.880
So they're definitely embracing like the portableness of it. Certainly, I think they

01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:11.440
could do more to like try to increase the hardware specs in it. I mean, the very least get something

01:09:11.440 --> 01:09:18.720
that's kind of comparable to say, the Steam Deck, you know, something like that. But yeah, it would

01:09:18.720 --> 01:09:25.120
be kind of hard for them to move away from it. But at the same time, like, would I be that

01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:32.640
disappointed? Maybe I guess my kids like playing it. They may mostly play it handheld anyways, but

01:09:34.880 --> 01:09:39.760
I don't know. Personally, me, I wouldn't care. I wouldn't care if they did something completely

01:09:39.760 --> 01:09:47.440
different, but I get it. Yeah. All right. Well, in this next story, we are talking about a very

01:09:47.440 --> 01:09:53.680
unlikely partnership of sorts. And that has to do with Diablo 4, which you know, is still on deck

01:09:53.680 --> 01:10:01.840
to come out this June. And KFC. Yeah, Blizzard is teaming up with KFC to help you get into the

01:10:01.840 --> 01:10:07.200
upcoming beta for Diablo 4 on PC and console. Now I want to point out there's multiple ways to get

01:10:07.200 --> 01:10:13.520
into this beta, you could just buy the Uber edition for like $100, which I may have done

01:10:14.480 --> 01:10:19.520
and get your way into the beta that way. But if that doesn't sound appetizing to you, well,

01:10:20.240 --> 01:10:25.360
you can go get a Double Down sandwich. And I use that term sandwich loosely when it comes to this.

01:10:25.360 --> 01:10:32.160
You can go get a Double Down on the toilet, a food product from KFC or the delivery app.

01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:38.240
I think it's interesting. You have to get it from KFC.com or the delivery app. However,

01:10:38.240 --> 01:10:42.000
you don't have to actually eat it if you don't want to. You just have to pay the money for one.

01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:46.960
Buying the sandwich will give you a code and you put that in your Battle.net account and you will

01:10:46.960 --> 01:10:53.680
be able to get into the beta, which is next weekend, March 17th through March 20th. Apparently,

01:10:53.680 --> 01:10:59.440
this is only available in the US, not available in Canada, because I don't think the Double Down

01:10:59.440 --> 01:11:05.440
is available in Canada yet. So or I'm sure it has something to do with regions and like, yeah.

01:11:05.440 --> 01:11:08.240
Yeah.

01:11:09.840 --> 01:11:15.760
No, the Double Down on paper sounded like a good thing. Like I tried it back when they first had

01:11:15.760 --> 01:11:20.480
it and it was a disappointment. It's not very good. Like the sauce that they put on it, not

01:11:20.480 --> 01:11:27.920
very good. I like KFC, but like, nah, it's just it's it's all gimmick. It really is.

01:11:28.640 --> 01:11:34.080
Quest Buster says Diablo 4 with 11 herbs and spices. It's, you know, the partnership with

01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:38.560
Diablo 4 is because when you eat a Double Down sandwich, you are going to experience hell,

01:11:39.360 --> 01:11:42.080
flying out of your butthole and lighting sweet.

01:11:42.080 --> 01:11:49.040
Honestly, they should have partnered with Dave's Hot Chicken, which I think has a Diablo

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:55.680
heat level. They may be called Inferno, but like, you should order one of those where it literally

01:11:55.680 --> 01:12:01.760
will burn your ass off like if you eat it. That would have been like, really, that would have

01:12:01.760 --> 01:12:06.320
made more sense than KFC. KFC and the Double Down. That's stupid.

01:12:07.040 --> 01:12:13.200
Oh, God. All right. Well, for those of you that are going to participate in getting a Double Down

01:12:13.200 --> 01:12:18.960
to get yourself a Beta Key, I salute you. And maybe maybe this will lead to a whole new toilet

01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:25.600
paper shortage across America. We'll see. All right. Let's let's go back to a simpler time.

01:12:25.600 --> 01:12:33.440
When at KFC, you got chicken while you enjoyed a classic video game. Let's get to the segment.

01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:49.440
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull

01:12:49.440 --> 01:12:54.320
out a classic and tell you about it. It's time for the classic game of the week.

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.800
And what did you pick for us this week, Dar Sakura?

01:12:59.520 --> 01:13:08.080
I picked Balls with a Z. So not to be confused with a more current mobile game. So it is a 2.5D

01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:15.040
action fighting game that came out for the Sega Genesis slash Mega Drive and the Super NES and

01:13:15.040 --> 01:13:22.240
the 3DO. It was developed by a company called PF Magic, published by Accolade, and it came out

01:13:22.320 --> 01:13:29.680
in 1994. The 3DO version is a director's cut that came out in 1995. It has three difficulty levels

01:13:29.680 --> 01:13:39.440
and you can play 21 matches. And it's unique because the characters are just literally made

01:13:39.440 --> 01:13:48.000
out of balls. Balls. She said balls. And the game really wasn't super successful,

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:54.880
but PF Magic used that technology to make some virtual pet titles like Pets, Dogs, Cats, and

01:13:54.880 --> 01:14:08.560
Oddballs, all with a Z. It basically was proposed by someone named Keith Kirby to use the balls

01:14:09.280 --> 01:14:14.320
as the characters. And so they implemented the idea to save processing power. And then the fact

01:14:14.320 --> 01:14:20.320
that no matter where the in-game camera, where the camera would be as they positioned it for

01:14:20.320 --> 01:14:28.400
the characters, that they would look the same from all angles because balls. The Mega Drive

01:14:28.400 --> 01:14:34.080
one was supposed to use the Edge 16, which is a modem system for multiplayer, but that was

01:14:34.080 --> 01:14:42.800
canceled. And of course, it's opening statement for the game on the Mega Drive was to be the

01:14:42.880 --> 01:14:48.320
champion, you gotta have balls. I know, mature. But because of the double entendre,

01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:53.440
Nintendo was like, no, you can't use that. So it was changed to you gotta play balls.

01:14:55.520 --> 01:15:01.680
So as far as your characters went, you had a few interesting ones.

01:15:03.920 --> 01:15:08.960
The main characters were Boomer, which was a clown, Bruiser, which was a bodybuilder,

01:15:08.960 --> 01:15:16.000
Crusher, that was a rhinoceros, Divine, a ballerina dancer and not, you know, the drag queen,

01:15:17.360 --> 01:15:21.680
Kronk, who's a caveman, Tsunami, who is a sumo,

01:15:24.240 --> 01:15:31.280
Turbo, who is a superhero, that's the only one with ranged attacks, Yoko the monkey. And only

01:15:31.280 --> 01:15:36.240
in the 3DO version, which was the director's cut, you get a character named Zombie. As for the

01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:45.120
bosses, you have Guggler, which is an ostrich, Bounder, that is a kangaroo, T-Rex, W-R-E-C-K-S,

01:15:45.120 --> 01:15:55.120
that's a dinosaur, Lamprey, which is a genie, and the Jester, which is the one that issued

01:15:55.120 --> 01:16:00.480
the challenge and he is the ultimate boss. The game got really mediocre reviews.

01:16:01.440 --> 01:16:07.840
EGM said the fighters are interesting, their taunts were funny, the whole idea is very

01:16:07.840 --> 01:16:14.640
innovative, but at the end, it was just really bland. I mean, people thought that it was,

01:16:14.640 --> 01:16:18.800
you know, it was a good concept. People liked it, but most of the people are just like,

01:16:20.160 --> 01:16:27.120
it's just the whole thing together didn't come together very well. But it was praised for its

01:16:27.120 --> 01:16:33.680
graphics, its design, and some of its sound design, but the moves were way too limited to

01:16:33.680 --> 01:16:40.400
keep it interesting. It was ranked seventh on the 2011 list of top 10 fighting games we'd like to

01:16:40.400 --> 01:16:51.280
forget by Game Informer. Next Generation reviewed the 3DO version of the game and gave it a two out

01:16:51.280 --> 01:16:55.920
of five stars and said, and I'm going to read the quote, if you accept its looks, it plays fine,

01:16:55.920 --> 01:17:00.240
but this is as much yesterday's technology as any sprite based fighter attempting to get away

01:17:00.240 --> 01:17:06.800
with digitized characters. It's almost too bad, but it's just a game out of time. And that's the

01:17:06.800 --> 01:17:15.200
game. Balls. Alright, not a game that, you know, we don't always spotlight games that were incredible,

01:17:15.200 --> 01:17:23.040
but this was certainly unique. I mean, this was very much a product of its time. Oh, was it?

01:17:23.680 --> 01:17:27.440
I think someone mentioned it. So I was like, yeah, I'll do it. Yeah. No, it's a good pick,

01:17:27.440 --> 01:17:32.720
but it's definitely a product of its era. I do also have some late breaking news or more

01:17:32.720 --> 01:17:36.720
recently news. Oh, what's that? Like as another story, if you don't mind. Sure, go for it.

01:17:37.760 --> 01:17:42.080
Warning to people playing Dead by Daylight right now, there's a series of DDoS attacks where they

01:17:42.080 --> 01:17:49.280
follow your IP. And in some cases, they're able to cut through VPNs. So I would highly suggest

01:17:49.280 --> 01:17:53.680
if you're going to play DVD right now, play through a VPN, make sure it's a really strong one.

01:17:55.440 --> 01:18:02.320
I'm not too worried myself because I play through Geforce, which is a virtual environment.

01:18:03.040 --> 01:18:06.320
But at the same time, I just wanted to go and put that out there. And of course,

01:18:06.320 --> 01:18:10.720
we don't have any word from behavior yet. No, of course not. It's Sunday. They're not

01:18:10.720 --> 01:18:15.440
even in the office. So yeah, it's just worth mentioning. Yeah. Alright.

01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:21.520
Uh, let's rapidly tackle some other news going on in the industry with some rapid fire news.

01:18:21.520 --> 01:18:28.800
We'll start with Loki. Yeah. So more Nintendo Lego sets coming. And now we're going to get

01:18:28.800 --> 01:18:36.640
Lego Donkey Kong coming out this summer, uh, as part of the Lego Mario series of sets.

01:18:36.640 --> 01:18:43.280
Along with that, they also unveiled, uh, a brand new Dry Bowser castle that's coming out August

01:18:43.280 --> 01:18:50.960
1st for $110. Uh, this was, uh, Lego's Mario day announcements that they had. Um,

01:18:52.160 --> 01:18:59.760
it's all too expensive. And apparently Mario is riding, um, Donkey Kong like a Yoshi or something.

01:18:59.760 --> 01:19:06.880
That's kind of weird. Um, also for Mario day, of course, we got a brand new, uh, Mario movie direct

01:19:06.880 --> 01:19:14.160
with the final trailer. It looks cool. Lots of Mario cartness and we even get fire Donkey Kong.

01:19:15.840 --> 01:19:19.600
So go check it out. I can't wait to see the movie. It's like less than a month away now.

01:19:20.240 --> 01:19:25.200
Yeah. For all my issues with one particular casting, I just feel like everything we've

01:19:25.200 --> 01:19:30.880
seen about it seems to rise above it. So I'll probably check it out. Um, if someone will take

01:19:30.880 --> 01:19:37.760
me on a date, but maybe Alan will actually see it. Who knows? We, we very rarely get out to

01:19:37.760 --> 01:19:41.120
movies. It's funny. Cause I was commenting to somebody the other day. I was like, yeah,

01:19:41.120 --> 01:19:45.520
I think I've only seen two movies in the theater in the last year. And one of them was everything

01:19:45.520 --> 01:19:49.840
everywhere all at once, you know, for all the talk about the movie going on tonight. I'm like,

01:19:49.840 --> 01:19:54.720
I think that's like one of two movies I saw in the theater in the last year or so. Um,

01:19:54.720 --> 01:20:00.160
maybe super Mario brothers will be one for this year. We'll see. Let's see. All right.

01:20:00.960 --> 01:20:05.040
I hear that the judges and dragons movie is awesome too. Like the reviews have been great

01:20:05.040 --> 01:20:11.840
so far, which is funny because the nineties one was not so no, that was a terrible movie.

01:20:12.880 --> 01:20:17.440
It'd be nice if they flipped the script a little. I really liked actually the one they did. And of

01:20:17.440 --> 01:20:22.480
course, Kroll was originally supposed to be a D and D movie. Interesting. All right. Uh,

01:20:22.480 --> 01:20:29.600
Darcy, you had a quick story for us here. Yeah, I guess I do. Um, so surprising to really

01:20:29.600 --> 01:20:36.960
nobody that's watched the show. Last of Us is the highest ranked video game adaptation of all time.

01:20:36.960 --> 01:20:42.000
It's been getting great reviews. It's been renewed for a second season. It had the second high,

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:48.880
second largest debut, uh, according to HBO. Um, it's behind actually the house of the dragon

01:20:49.440 --> 01:20:59.040
and it's been just considered amazing. It got, uh, a 9.4, uh, out of 10 across the boards for,

01:20:59.040 --> 01:21:08.160
uh, uh, IMDB and a lot of the ranking systems. Um, it actually almost matches the games ranking,

01:21:08.160 --> 01:21:17.920
which was a 9.7. Um, and the user, uh, rankings on IMDB are like just astounding over the,

01:21:17.920 --> 01:21:21.840
over the moon. It's, it's better than the Witcher in part, in terms of how it was ranked as well.

01:21:22.400 --> 01:21:28.400
And it's even ranking over Castlevania and definitely over Halo, which was terrible,

01:21:28.400 --> 01:21:37.280
but yeah, as far as the video game ones, just to go through, um, uh, the, uh, adaptation.

01:21:37.280 --> 01:21:42.800
So last of us is at the top followed by the Witcher and the league of legends was as arcane

01:21:42.800 --> 01:21:50.000
Castlevania, Halo, Tron uprising. I don't know why that's there because it was not the video

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:57.760
game. The dragon age absolution was also pretty, pretty up there, but above all of it, um,

01:21:58.640 --> 01:22:03.120
and number nine on the list, by the way, is Mass Effect Paragon lost, which was pretty good.

01:22:04.240 --> 01:22:07.840
Our arcane that league of legends one is apparently really good, even if you don't

01:22:07.840 --> 01:22:11.280
really follow legal legends. So I thought that was interesting. So I'm not surprised

01:22:11.280 --> 01:22:17.600
that's popping up there. So, um, but, uh, I just, uh, at some point I'll get around to watching the

01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:21.840
last of us. I'm just so behind on TV. You know what? I finally watched this week, especially

01:22:21.840 --> 01:22:27.440
considering the cruise I just went on. I finally started watching lower decks this week. It's

01:22:27.440 --> 01:22:32.880
really funny. I like, I'm actually glad I finally got motivated to watch it cause it is really funny.

01:22:32.880 --> 01:22:39.040
So, and the, the characters in it are so good. So, you know, I only have what, like 28 more

01:22:39.040 --> 01:22:42.400
episodes of that to watch and then I can get around to a last of us to some of this other

01:22:42.400 --> 01:22:47.360
stuff I'm behind on. So I'm just that cool hip old man watching shows from five years ago.

01:22:48.800 --> 01:22:55.120
All right. Uh, speaking of up and coming new things, you can check out the Xbox games showcase

01:22:55.120 --> 01:23:00.560
on June 11th. That's going to be immediately followed by a star field direct. So it's going

01:23:00.560 --> 01:23:06.720
to be a big day for lots of Xbox games. Of course, that date probably sounding very much like an E3

01:23:06.720 --> 01:23:14.000
kind of date. And considering we still don't, by the way, less than three months out until E3 and

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:21.200
we don't even have confirmation that it's actually happening. Um, I'll just leave that there, but

01:23:21.200 --> 01:23:26.000
Microsoft will be doing a game showcase if you know, nothing else on June 11th. And I imagine

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:30.160
not only will we hear about star field, but maybe some of the other releases from Microsoft this

01:23:30.160 --> 01:23:38.480
year, I'm hoping for fable. I'm hoping for some news on fable. I really want to know what playground

01:23:38.480 --> 01:23:44.000
for fable. Yeah. The, uh, uh, Forza horizon team is done with the fable series because Forza

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:49.520
horizon is, you know, they, they, there are many people, myself among them that will say, that's

01:23:49.520 --> 01:23:54.160
the reason to own an Xbox. That is the game you are truly missing. If you are not on Microsoft's

01:23:54.160 --> 01:24:00.240
platform is horizon. Even if you're not a racing game fan, it horizon is that good. And, uh, the

01:24:00.240 --> 01:24:06.080
fact that they're going to be working on now fable makes me really curious what they're going to do

01:24:06.080 --> 01:24:11.520
with it. Uh, Zen monkey 11 and chat says, it's just going to be a fable MMO light game. I don't,

01:24:11.520 --> 01:24:16.880
I don't maybe, I am sorry. Don't threaten me with a good time. I know that actually would not be a

01:24:16.880 --> 01:24:22.240
bad thing. I mean, could it be open world the way the horizon is open world that it's a little bit

01:24:22.240 --> 01:24:26.640
more drop in and drop out? Like I don't want to just assume because horizon has done a certain

01:24:26.640 --> 01:24:30.400
way fable is going to be done the same way. I think the developers have the bandwidth to do

01:24:30.400 --> 01:24:37.040
other stuff with it if they want. So, uh, anyway, I'll be very curious to see what comes out of

01:24:37.040 --> 01:24:43.280
this, but we'll, we'll all find out together on June 11th. Is that a show night? Cause I know,

01:24:43.280 --> 01:24:48.800
uh, I'm having a peek ahead June. Yes. June 11th is a show night. Ooh, this could be interesting.

01:24:48.800 --> 01:24:53.200
This could be an interesting summer. All right, we'll see. Uh, let's travel around the world and

01:24:53.200 --> 01:24:57.600
check out some releases, some things that are going to be coming out a little sooner than fable

01:24:57.600 --> 01:25:04.240
on the Xbox, uh, things this week in the U S and beyond starting in the U S Loki. Uh, we have hot

01:25:04.240 --> 01:25:10.480
wheels, rift rally on iOS PlayStation form PlayStation five, uh, the legend of heroes trails

01:25:10.480 --> 01:25:18.080
to Azure on PC, Nintendo switch and PlayStation four, uh, Valheim coming to Xbox one and Xbox

01:25:18.080 --> 01:25:24.560
series. Vernal edge on PC, Nintendo switch, PlayStation four, PlayStation five, Xbox one

01:25:24.560 --> 01:25:32.880
and Xbox series. Alice gear, agus CS, uh, concentro of the symbol tricks, I guess,

01:25:33.440 --> 01:25:38.960
civil tricks, uh, that's on the Nintendo switch PlayStation four and PlayStation five,

01:25:38.960 --> 01:25:44.800
the dark pictures, switchback VR. I thought that was a large game, but as this kind of launch,

01:25:44.800 --> 01:25:52.800
uh, that is on PlayStation VR to, uh, post void, the Nintendo switch and PlayStation four,

01:25:53.600 --> 01:26:01.040
Bayonetta origins, Theresa and the lost demon on Nintendo switch flame keeper on PC and

01:26:01.040 --> 01:26:09.840
Nintendo switch. And, uh, last but not least WWE two K 23 on PC, PlayStation four, PlayStation

01:26:09.840 --> 01:26:16.160
five, Xbox one and Xbox series. Uh, before we get to Japan, great question from chat regarding the

01:26:16.160 --> 01:26:20.960
Xbox event when dark to see a pointed out, uh, that he wasn't sure what time it was going to be

01:26:20.960 --> 01:26:25.680
at. They haven't announced the time. And that is very interesting. I would bank that it's probably

01:26:25.680 --> 01:26:29.840
going to be more of a morning ish event. I don't think necessarily like 9.00 AM, but it could be

01:26:29.840 --> 01:26:35.680
more like an 11 AM, maybe even as early as 10 AM. Here's my logic behind that, um, Europe, or,

01:26:35.680 --> 01:26:40.560
you know, not all of Europe, but you know, the, the, the main Europe time is going to be five

01:26:40.560 --> 01:26:46.000
hours ahead of Eastern time, which is eight hours ahead of Pacific time. So something that's at

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:50.960
noon for us in California is going to be at 8 PM for Europe or prime time. If they are going to

01:26:50.960 --> 01:26:55.280
feature a game like fable being developed by a studio in Europe, it makes a lot of sense for

01:26:55.280 --> 01:26:59.520
them to do that with the world being the way it's laid out. Somebody is always going to have it in

01:26:59.520 --> 01:27:04.720
the middle of the night. Um, Japan being in the middle of the night for Microsoft makes a lot of

01:27:04.720 --> 01:27:09.840
sense. Microsoft is, it doesn't have as much to show Japan. We all know that. So, uh, it makes

01:27:09.840 --> 01:27:15.120
sense that because if they did it in the morning here, it would be something like, God, probably

01:27:15.120 --> 01:27:20.480
like three in the morning for Japan. But I think Microsoft's probably willing to, uh, cut that loss.

01:27:21.120 --> 01:27:25.440
Whereas if they did it in the, at the, in the night here, if they did it at a 5 PM or an 8 PM

01:27:25.440 --> 01:27:30.480
slot, it's going to be like one or 2 AM for Europe. And I think, uh, Microsoft's not going

01:27:30.480 --> 01:27:34.960
to want to do that. So we'll see what happens though. Uh, anything could happen and, you know,

01:27:34.960 --> 01:27:40.320
if maybe they have a big announcement that they want Japan's attention for, uh, anything is

01:27:40.320 --> 01:27:45.120
possible. Speaking of Japan, let's check out the releases that they are getting this week.

01:27:45.120 --> 01:27:51.840
We'll start with the Nintendo switch, which sees Dawn of the monsters this week, as well as Jitsu

01:27:51.840 --> 01:27:57.760
squad in a regular and special edition. This week, six target star trail is out in a regular

01:27:57.760 --> 01:28:04.320
and limited edition stranger of sword city, as well as blue winged. Chevalier comes out this

01:28:04.320 --> 01:28:10.480
week. Uh, also Bayonetta origins, uh, in a lockstep with the European release of Bayonetta

01:28:10.480 --> 01:28:15.680
origins and the U S release on St. Patrick's day. So Bayonetta is also out on the switch.

01:28:15.680 --> 01:28:20.560
That game is releasing a lot sooner than I would have expected it to, but I guess it has been in

01:28:20.640 --> 01:28:24.720
those directs lately. So it's just, I'm just like, Whoa, that game is suddenly coming. Okay. I

01:28:24.720 --> 01:28:29.680
thought that was like a summer game. Anyway, PlayStation five, you really only have Dawn

01:28:29.680 --> 01:28:38.400
of the monsters this week, but you also have an, a no, a no 1800. Uh, this is a, uh, Ubisoft game.

01:28:38.400 --> 01:28:44.720
That's like old warships type of thing. So, uh, 1800 probably being the year. Uh, so that is out

01:28:44.800 --> 01:28:50.480
this week as well. And, uh, that is it for PlayStation five releases this week.

01:28:50.480 --> 01:28:58.400
Let's go over to Europe, dark soccer. We have on the 14th, uh, transport fever two for PlayStation

01:28:58.400 --> 01:29:07.760
X-Box for the same also clash artifacts of chaos, Zeno edition, WWE two K 23 deluxe edition on the

01:29:07.760 --> 01:29:15.280
16th for PlayStation switch. We have Alice gear Aegis, um, for PlayStation and X-Box we have, uh,

01:29:15.280 --> 01:29:23.040
I know 1800 console edition, uh, for, uh, PC. We are, I should say just for computer, we have,

01:29:23.040 --> 01:29:28.880
uh, the Sims four going together expansion on the 17th for PlayStation and switch. We have a signal

01:29:28.880 --> 01:29:36.800
us, um, on switch, we have Bayonetta origins, Theresa and the lost demon on, uh, the three,

01:29:36.800 --> 01:29:43.680
we have Peppa pig world adventures. Um, on the 17th for PlayStation X-Box, we have WWE

01:29:43.680 --> 01:29:49.120
two K 23, um, for PlayStation switch, we have windstorm and unexpected arrival.

01:29:51.680 --> 01:29:56.480
All right. A few more stories for y'all, and then we'll get to the listener round table

01:29:56.480 --> 01:30:00.160
featuring your emails. Actually, I don't think we have emails tonight, but maybe we'll see

01:30:00.160 --> 01:30:05.680
participate at orange.com, uh, phone calls and chat comments. Uh, we'll get to that in a minute

01:30:05.680 --> 01:30:12.400
though, but first we have some more stories for you. Loki. Yeah. So, um, with the new update that

01:30:12.400 --> 01:30:18.240
came out for Mario Kart eight, it of course added Berto to the roster of characters,

01:30:18.240 --> 01:30:25.040
but along with that, a new column for, uh, new characters. And now it appears that there's still

01:30:25.040 --> 01:30:30.560
five more new characters coming to Mario Kart eight. So that's exciting. Um, we'll have to

01:30:30.560 --> 01:30:36.640
see who exactly is going to be coming, but, um, I guess in the future DLC, we'll see those five

01:30:36.640 --> 01:30:42.800
characters come in. Orange. Right. And chat says pink, gold, Daisy. Don't joke about that because

01:30:42.800 --> 01:30:48.560
honestly like just alternate skins of existing care. I bet I'm going to put, I'm going to put

01:30:48.560 --> 01:30:53.440
an official OLR bet an official Rob Roberts prediction. At least one of those characters

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:57.840
is just some terrible reskin of an existing character.

01:30:59.520 --> 01:31:02.960
But I bet we'll get a couple. I bet we'll get a couple interesting ones in that.

01:31:02.960 --> 01:31:07.360
I'm not sure who's missing. Oh, fire emblem. We don't have anyone from fire emblem in the game

01:31:07.360 --> 01:31:13.840
yet. Right. You will get someone from the Mario movie. We can get the, one of those penguins.

01:31:14.800 --> 01:31:19.120
Oh, that might be cute. A Mario movie tie-in. I like what you're thinking with that. Yeah.

01:31:19.120 --> 01:31:25.280
Maybe one of the penguins or something. Huh? That's a cute idea. Yeah. Mike Defton chat says

01:31:25.280 --> 01:31:31.680
silver Yoshi and Birdo. Oh, yo Yoshi's a prime target for the really cheap reskin type of thing.

01:31:31.680 --> 01:31:36.320
Cause Yoshi already had reskins. That's in the lore. If you want to go back to super Mario world

01:31:36.320 --> 01:31:41.440
and like the red Yoshi that shoots fire. Well, you can do that already in Mario card eight. You can,

01:31:41.440 --> 01:31:46.080
you select Yoshi and you can choose the ultimate thing for that. I haven't played in so long. I

01:31:46.080 --> 01:31:50.880
don't even remember that. So, but yeah, there's stupid things like metal Mario where it's like

01:31:50.880 --> 01:31:56.080
gold Mario and yeah. Yeah. So pink gold. All right. We'll see. We'll see. All right.

01:31:58.480 --> 01:32:08.240
Moving on dark soccer. Amazon's got actually an abstract proposed for something called Alexa

01:32:09.040 --> 01:32:15.680
arena, which excuse me, my voice is catching. Which basically is an interactive platform

01:32:16.640 --> 01:32:25.200
for AI training where you go through the game and it's, you have to like do just certain

01:32:25.200 --> 01:32:31.840
normal tasks, a specific way. Like one is plug the floppy disc into the computer with a skull on it,

01:32:32.480 --> 01:32:38.080
you know, and it's like this, the scenario laid out is going into an office, but it's supposed to

01:32:38.160 --> 01:32:48.480
work for machine learning to apply to everyday office use and personal assistant use. So yeah,

01:32:48.480 --> 01:32:54.400
our robot overlords are getting closer. This kind of ties in a little bit so that

01:32:54.400 --> 01:32:57.840
I know you were here at the beginning of the show. We were talking in depth a little bit about AI,

01:32:58.560 --> 01:33:01.360
you know, and that seems to be the next big thing in gaming because, you know,

01:33:01.360 --> 01:33:07.440
Discord's been doing a lot with AI and this, you know, training the robots, how to kind of,

01:33:07.440 --> 01:33:11.760
it's interesting that a lot of companies are going this direction. It's going to be very

01:33:12.480 --> 01:33:19.360
interesting to see. I've taken some courses in machine learning and it actually,

01:33:20.800 --> 01:33:24.320
they can't really do anything without the information that we feed them. So they have

01:33:24.320 --> 01:33:30.480
to build up a massive database of information. Doing a game to do this is actually a pretty

01:33:30.480 --> 01:33:36.640
smart idea. You know, I'm just saying. There are clever ways to get people's data,

01:33:36.640 --> 01:33:42.720
absolutely. No, I'm not saying this is for people's data. This is for training in AI by providing it

01:33:42.720 --> 01:33:45.680
feedback. My brain went to- This has nothing to do with personal data.

01:33:45.680 --> 01:33:52.960
My brain went to Pokemon sleep and how that is like using cute little, cute Pokemon to

01:33:52.960 --> 01:33:58.400
farm people's sleeping data. Which is, this is something completely different. This is teaching

01:33:58.400 --> 01:34:02.640
activity and giving it a broad range of activity to add to its learning.

01:34:02.640 --> 01:34:06.640
All right. My brain's a little bit on this whole stealing things.

01:34:06.640 --> 01:34:08.080
That's not how machine learning works.

01:34:08.720 --> 01:34:12.640
Well, say that to the AI art robots because that's-

01:34:12.640 --> 01:34:17.920
That's a little different. This is more for teaching an assistive AI.

01:34:19.200 --> 01:34:20.880
All right. Moving on. Loki.

01:34:21.520 --> 01:34:29.040
All right. So this is not too surprising, but you know, after the reveal of the Suicide Squad

01:34:29.040 --> 01:34:34.160
gameplay that was recently part of the deep dive that they did in the PlayStation,

01:34:35.360 --> 01:34:41.040
was it PlayStation Now event that they had, fans were very disappointed by what they saw.

01:34:41.760 --> 01:34:50.240
And as such, Rocksteady has now delayed the game from May to sometime later this year to

01:34:51.840 --> 01:34:54.400
address those concerns from-

01:34:55.040 --> 01:34:58.880
Taking a page out of the first Sonic the Hedgehog trailer playbook, right?

01:34:59.680 --> 01:35:01.360
Something to that effect. Yeah.

01:35:01.360 --> 01:35:04.080
Hey, you know what? It worked out well for that movie. So

01:35:04.640 --> 01:35:08.320
maybe- Honestly, this actually is probably news we should be applauding.

01:35:08.320 --> 01:35:09.920
I don't think we should be looking at this going-

01:35:10.480 --> 01:35:17.760
Yeah. Basically saying- Jason Schreier explained that, you know, don't expect any big changes,

01:35:17.760 --> 01:35:21.680
but you know, instead it's gonna be some polishing as to what's already there.

01:35:24.480 --> 01:35:30.000
They're gonna have to make some changes though, because it looked pretty not great.

01:35:32.480 --> 01:35:37.280
You know what? It's just like, Suicide Squad's just not crack down. Please don't make it crack

01:35:37.280 --> 01:35:46.480
down. All right. Well, this particular series isn't Persona, but that's not going to stop

01:35:46.480 --> 01:35:54.240
somebody from trying. And yes, I've been sent this little movie a lot. And I think technically

01:35:54.240 --> 01:35:58.400
it came up at the end of the show last week, but let's talk now officially on record about

01:35:58.960 --> 01:36:03.280
the Persona type RPG where you are going to play as the Golden Girls.

01:36:04.640 --> 01:36:09.440
That's right. It's the Golden Girls Take Manhattan DX, and it's developed by Joey

01:36:09.440 --> 01:36:15.760
Pagano and Chris Lindgren. It's a fast paced JRPG where you play as Rose, Dorothy, Sophia,

01:36:15.760 --> 01:36:22.080
and Blanche on the streets of Miami where you're battling clowns for whatever reason. And you do

01:36:22.080 --> 01:36:28.320
Dark Souls type adventures through dungeons. There's a whole trailer as well that came out,

01:36:28.320 --> 01:36:34.400
which I don't know how this isn't getting cease and desisted, but apparently what happened,

01:36:34.400 --> 01:36:42.400
and this is all on the Game Dev website, if you want to read at j-e-o-y.dev, you can read the

01:36:42.400 --> 01:36:46.560
blog that says, what started as a joke has quickly spiraled into a playground of ideas meant to

01:36:46.560 --> 01:36:51.600
explore just how much we can push our skills and retain our sanity with our own brand of humor.

01:36:51.600 --> 01:36:56.320
Simply put, this is Persona 5's gameplay replaced with the context of the Golden Girls. There is no

01:36:56.320 --> 01:37:01.440
reason why we use that coat of paint other than how far can we take this joke? I'm a little

01:37:01.440 --> 01:37:08.240
worried it's going to get C&D'd over that, but otherwise it's scheduled to release this holiday

01:37:08.240 --> 01:37:20.480
season. In looking at the trailer, the characters look different enough. When you do something like

01:37:20.480 --> 01:37:29.600
this, it doesn't just have to be like the Golden Girls IP, but then you also have the likenesses

01:37:29.600 --> 01:37:38.240
to the actresses that played Blanche, Sophia, and so forth. And I would say that I don't think

01:37:39.600 --> 01:37:46.480
that the rose really looks like Betty White, but the Dorothy looks a lot like Bea Arthur to me.

01:37:47.120 --> 01:37:53.840
So I feel like that's a whole other place that this could get tied up, because what was it?

01:37:54.320 --> 01:38:01.600
Oops, not the intro playing again. Was it the Clue game or something? There's some official

01:38:01.600 --> 01:38:06.720
license thing out there. I think it's the Clue game. Sophia looks nothing like Sophia,

01:38:07.440 --> 01:38:12.000
and I think it's because they probably couldn't get the estate of Estelle Getty to sign on to it.

01:38:12.640 --> 01:38:19.120
So whether it's a tied up in logistics thing or they really just didn't want to be associated

01:38:19.120 --> 01:38:24.240
with it or whatever the reason is. Anyway, my point is never announce these things this far

01:38:24.240 --> 01:38:28.400
in advance unless you're ready to drop the game on the internet tomorrow. And it's a once on the

01:38:28.400 --> 01:38:32.880
internet, always on the internet type of situation because I feel like this is going to get cease and

01:38:32.880 --> 01:38:38.560
desisted. And they're going to have to change those characters into Grandma RPG, you know,

01:38:38.560 --> 01:38:43.520
with nondescript older, you know, which we'll all know what it is wink wink nudge, but

01:38:43.520 --> 01:38:48.000
well, I mean, if they give them guns, and that would suffice for one of our dreams.

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:52.560
That is that is okay, but okay, but Golden Girls will win.

01:38:53.360 --> 01:39:00.560
Hey, I'd be into that. That's for sure. Ah, some comments and chat Zen monkey with some lore.

01:39:01.440 --> 01:39:05.680
I think they did a popular Golden Girls episode with a clown. I think Dorothy's husband was

01:39:05.680 --> 01:39:10.560
dressed like a clown or something. I'm sure they got Stan. In fact, that is a image that's coming

01:39:10.560 --> 01:39:16.560
to my mind to stand in a clown outfit because it's a really, you know, funny image when she's

01:39:16.560 --> 01:39:24.720
talking about her ex. So anyway, uh, let's see. Fifth Dream says olden gals. Yeah, that just

01:39:24.720 --> 01:39:28.960
changed the name a little bit. Rhetortainment points out there's a reason why the Golden Girls

01:39:28.960 --> 01:39:33.200
Chia pet doesn't look like any of the Golden Girls. They'd have to pay the Estator. Yeah,

01:39:33.200 --> 01:39:38.480
it's exactly that type of thing for sure. So and everybody in chat is like,

01:39:38.480 --> 01:39:44.640
just base it off of Golden Palace instead. That's true. If they can't get the estate of

01:39:45.440 --> 01:39:50.240
Bea Arthur to sign on, they sure could. They'd have to get who was it? Was it Cheech

01:39:50.240 --> 01:39:57.120
from Cheech and Chong was in that as well. And then one other well known actor today.

01:39:57.120 --> 01:40:03.680
Was it Don Cheadle was in that? I want to say yes, Don Cheadle was in that. Yes, that's it.

01:40:03.680 --> 01:40:09.440
So. All right. Moving on. Yeah, I would expect you would know these things Loki because I know

01:40:09.440 --> 01:40:13.600
your wife has made you watch them all. I have never watched Golden Palace. Really?

01:40:13.600 --> 01:40:17.680
Actually, you know, I take that back. I may have seen it on TV like when it was actually on like

01:40:17.680 --> 01:40:22.240
a long time ago, but I remember it when it was actually on TV. We used to watch like,

01:40:22.240 --> 01:40:28.160
we used to watch Golden Girls that I think my grandparents house or maybe watch it at home too.

01:40:28.160 --> 01:40:32.960
I don't know. But it was like a staple. It was definitely something we watched when it was on

01:40:32.960 --> 01:40:37.680
like actually airing on TV. And I'm pretty sure that we watched at least I've seen like

01:40:37.680 --> 01:40:43.120
a an episode of Golden Palace. It was only on for one season. Golden Palace was essentially the

01:40:43.120 --> 01:40:47.600
eighth season of Golden Girls without Bea Arthur. You know, it's just yeah, it's very,

01:40:47.600 --> 01:40:51.520
very different. That's why I didn't do it was on a different network. It wasn't on NBC was on CBS.

01:40:54.960 --> 01:41:01.360
Yeah, no, I was just gonna say with that I was gonna say Golden Girls was on for so long. It

01:41:01.360 --> 01:41:07.040
was on for like seven years that by the time they got to Golden Palace, it was like 92.

01:41:07.040 --> 01:41:11.360
So that's around the time at least for me, I was like a freshman, sophomore in high school by the

01:41:11.360 --> 01:41:17.680
time you know that happened. So I wasn't that young when that came out. So that was our staple

01:41:17.680 --> 01:41:24.720
in designing women. Oh, and that was the night that the lights went out. Well before it was a

01:41:24.720 --> 01:41:29.760
Drag Race monologue lip sync. But if they were going to pick any monologue to be a lip sync on

01:41:29.760 --> 01:41:37.040
that television program, that is the one to do so I will give them that. So now now I just now I

01:41:37.040 --> 01:41:44.320
can't even see like, what was her name? It wasn't Delta Burke. It was. Oh, my God, the other star

01:41:44.320 --> 01:41:52.240
that show. I can't remember her name. Dixie Carter. Dixie Carter. Yeah, yeah. Um, I now I

01:41:52.240 --> 01:41:58.240
see Monet X Change doing it in my mind. I don't even see Dixie Carter doing it. All right.

01:41:58.880 --> 01:42:03.760
I mean, I will say when when someone says the the night the lights went out of Georgia, I think of

01:42:03.760 --> 01:42:09.920
Vicki Lawrence. Yes, there is that too. I know that because that was the staple in my household

01:42:09.920 --> 01:42:18.000
was mama's family. And my mother loved, loved, loved Carol Burnett and everything associated

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:24.400
with it. Vicki Lawrence's rendition of that song is just like, gives me chills. Oh, yeah. All

01:42:24.400 --> 01:42:28.800
right. Let's move on. That was it. That was it for the last story. I can't believe I put that

01:42:28.800 --> 01:42:34.960
story last. Yes. All right. No, I will. I'm not like it's just it's funny, like how many times

01:42:34.960 --> 01:42:41.200
that was sent to me. But I, I don't like I get to the point where I appreciate that those sorts of

01:42:41.200 --> 01:42:46.320
things make people think of me. I do appreciate it. All right. Let's get to the listener round

01:42:46.320 --> 01:42:52.080
table. If you would like to email us participate at OrangeLawnTrader.com or you'd like to call us

01:42:52.080 --> 01:42:57.520
by joining our green room over on Discord vog network.com slash discord if you'd like to join

01:42:57.520 --> 01:43:02.560
our Discord server. Or we can just reminisce about 80s TV shows like y'all are doing in chat. But

01:43:02.560 --> 01:43:08.000
seriously, anything you want to bring up as well we can talk about here. I just want to confirm I

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:13.040
don't think we have emails tonight just confirming that. Okay, so I thought we had junk. We had Oh,

01:43:13.040 --> 01:43:16.560
yay junk. My favorite. Maybe it's time to change the address again. I don't know.

01:43:17.120 --> 01:43:22.560
Um, no, we don't get that much junk. No, it was it was bad when we changed it the first time it was

01:43:22.560 --> 01:43:30.720
bad, but it's not so bad anymore. Let's see. Michigan says, you know, I never knew Vicki

01:43:30.720 --> 01:43:35.200
Lawrence was the one who originally sang that song. I feel dumb now thinking it was Reba.

01:43:35.200 --> 01:43:39.920
I thought there was someone before Vicki even. Or I thought it was a old old song.

01:43:41.200 --> 01:43:45.280
Yeah, it's supposed to be an older song. Yeah. I think Vicki just had like a

01:43:47.360 --> 01:43:53.920
very successful version of it. All right, so the it was a southern gothic murder ballad written in

01:43:53.920 --> 01:44:02.560
1972. By Bobby Russell and recorded by his then wife Vicki Lawrence. Hers is the original.

01:44:02.560 --> 01:44:08.160
Really? I thought there was a version before. Okay. How about that? All right.

01:44:09.040 --> 01:44:12.640
And then it was covered by Reba McEntire in 1991. Right.

01:44:12.640 --> 01:44:20.240
Yeah, whenever I think a Reba, I'm only gonna think of fancy. That is the definitive Reba

01:44:20.240 --> 01:44:27.440
song for me. I used to have a hat. I miss my hat that I got in Vegas. So you know Reba

01:44:27.440 --> 01:44:33.120
played the Vegas show that was at the Celine amphitheater that Adele's in now, right? Reba

01:44:33.120 --> 01:44:37.360
had a show there for a little bit. And when I was in Vegas, we didn't get to see the show sadly,

01:44:37.360 --> 01:44:41.920
but there's always the souvenir shop. So I bought a hat. It was a cool little black hat. You might

01:44:41.920 --> 01:44:48.800
remember this. It said fancy on the hat. I love that hat. Unfortunately, the fancy lettering

01:44:48.800 --> 01:44:55.200
started to tear off. It was no good anymore. So cheaply made hat. I know who did the other

01:44:55.200 --> 01:45:01.120
version. Tanya Tucker did one with alternate lyrics. Ah, maybe I was thinking of Tanya Tucker.

01:45:01.120 --> 01:45:09.200
Okay. Yeah. Anyway. All right. And there's your country music history of the day. Thank you.

01:45:12.080 --> 01:45:17.920
sj100matt says we need a TV 8090 sitcom special episode. We still need Orange Launch Fudio.

01:45:17.920 --> 01:45:21.440
We got to make that happen. We've been talking about that for a while. I guess I need to lock

01:45:21.440 --> 01:45:25.520
down a date with my co hosts here. Now that I'm back from the cruise and all that stuff. So

01:45:27.040 --> 01:45:34.560
we'll make that happen. Yeah. All right. What other special shows would you like to see here

01:45:34.560 --> 01:45:41.120
at VOG Network? Because the the special cast on the cruise was fun. I'll bring grandpa back for

01:45:41.120 --> 01:45:46.880
something else. He was surprisingly well behaved compared to his days on Hoard House. I think he

01:45:46.880 --> 01:45:53.840
I think he got the memo that some things have changed. He's mellowed some. I wouldn't say

01:45:53.840 --> 01:46:00.080
mellowed but he's he is he's adjusted his digs on me. He was he still gave me hell but he adjusted

01:46:00.080 --> 01:46:07.280
them appropriately. So it's good. By the way, Ron Shawn I can do an 80s style music. Just wait.

01:46:07.920 --> 01:46:12.560
Okay. We have an anniversary. So coming up in June, maybe we'll we'll play around with some

01:46:12.560 --> 01:46:19.680
of that. All right. Anyway. All right. Well, not a lot of other activity coming in. So you know

01:46:19.680 --> 01:46:23.440
what I think I think even though it's a little shorter tonight, I think we've hit the end of the

01:46:23.440 --> 01:46:29.360
show. This is what it is. I know I just got here. I know. There's stuff on TV that has people's

01:46:29.360 --> 01:46:34.800
attention to I don't know if you heard about that whole thing going on tonight. So the Oscars are

01:46:34.800 --> 01:46:40.640
tonight. Oh, shit. I don't pay attention. I know we will we've been doing this for over 20 years.

01:46:40.640 --> 01:46:47.680
So we kind of but you know, I important I noticed the nights that big things are on TV. It's also

01:46:47.680 --> 01:46:52.560
to be fair. It's also the last of us finale, which I don't know who counter program that on the

01:46:52.560 --> 01:46:57.920
Oscars, but maybe because they have a lot of on demand watchers for that. So there's that. All

01:46:57.920 --> 01:47:02.800
right. Looking for voice talent. Let's go around and get everybody's final thought for the night.

01:47:02.800 --> 01:47:05.440
First off, I'm gonna say thank you so much for listening to Orange Launch Radio. Thank

01:47:05.440 --> 01:47:09.360
you for tuning in. We are the show where every gamer has a voice but to get more voices out

01:47:09.360 --> 01:47:13.040
there. We need them. So tell a friend or two about the show help us spread the word. A nice

01:47:13.040 --> 01:47:18.000
five star review on a site like iTunes goes an awful long way. We appreciate all of that as well

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:23.760
wherever it is you listen to show Spotify. Help us spread the word. We appreciate it. With that,

01:47:23.760 --> 01:47:26.960
we'll get to final thoughts star Sakura. Sorry, you missed most of the show, but I hope you had

01:47:26.960 --> 01:47:32.560
fun with the stream. I did. And it was nice to finally get to participate in that. But I'm

01:47:32.560 --> 01:47:38.320
going to be hopping back into the fog immediately. You're still going tonight. So yeah, I am. Hey,

01:47:38.320 --> 01:47:44.320
you gotta have consistency, right? Yeah, it's important. And rank reset is tomorrow. So I want

01:47:44.320 --> 01:47:51.840
to do as much bullshit gaming while I'm eerie one as I can. Sounds good. All right. All right. Well,

01:47:51.840 --> 01:47:57.760
have a great stream tonight. Later, taters. And remember, bullshit shenanigans. It's a thing.

01:47:57.760 --> 01:48:00.640
Okay, later. Loki, your final thought for tonight?

01:48:03.040 --> 01:48:08.480
My final thought is it's nice to see everything everywhere all at once sweeping the Oscars.

01:48:10.480 --> 01:48:14.160
Did it win? Did it win the big one? Or do we not know? Not yet, but it's won like,

01:48:14.800 --> 01:48:21.920
four or five categories already. What was it? Best Supporting Actress, Best Supporting Actor,

01:48:22.800 --> 01:48:29.360
uh, Best Screenplay. And there's something else. I missed it.

01:48:31.200 --> 01:48:35.280
Let's see, my final thought for tonight. I guess I'll plug my own streaming. Next week,

01:48:35.280 --> 01:48:39.920
I'm going to stream on Tuesday and Thursday. Tuesday, I'm hoping to finish No Man's Sky

01:48:39.920 --> 01:48:44.880
Expedition 9. I don't know if I can actually do it all in one night. So we'll try our best to get it

01:48:44.880 --> 01:48:49.360
done on Tuesday. If not, maybe I'll have to do a bonus stream. I was gonna do a bonus stream over

01:48:49.360 --> 01:48:55.440
the weekend. But if the Diablo 4 beta is this weekend, then no. I don't know if we can stream

01:48:55.440 --> 01:49:00.240
the Diablo 4 beta. I imagine if it's an open beta, we must be able to because I'll be playing

01:49:00.240 --> 01:49:05.280
way too much of that this weekend. Believe it. So if they allow me to stream it, I will. If I'm not

01:49:05.280 --> 01:49:11.600
allowed to, then I won't. Thursday, I'm gonna play more theater. The World Ends With You DLC will be

01:49:11.600 --> 01:49:16.480
out on Thursday. So I look forward to that. Otherwise, I hope everybody has a great week.

01:49:16.480 --> 01:49:20.800
Please be safe if you partake in St. Patrick's Day shenanigans. Although for some reason,

01:49:20.800 --> 01:49:24.480
it seems like a lot of that happened this past weekend. Like they died the river in Chicago

01:49:24.480 --> 01:49:29.680
this weekend when St. Patrick's Day is on a Friday. I don't know. They must do it on a Saturday

01:49:29.680 --> 01:49:37.120
or something. So yeah, I'll be curious to see what shenanigans happen on Friday. But please be safe,

01:49:37.120 --> 01:49:40.880
y'all. And have a good one. That's gonna do it for another episode of Orange Laundry. Have a great

01:49:40.880 --> 01:49:46.320
week. We will see you next time. And be safe, everyone. Have a wonderful night. Bye.

01:50:10.880 --> 01:50:26.640
Those of the staff of orange lounge radio nor fog network, but you know, they were all still true.
