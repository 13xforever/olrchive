0	13240	This week, I had a sudden desire to play Chrono Trigger on the Switch, which isn't
13240	14240	currently possible.
14240	17040	I could get out my 3DS and play it there, but the ergonomics of the Switch were a little
17040	18040	bit better for me.
18040	21460	I could play it on my phone, and might, since my 3DS's battery is very degraded.
21460	22880	Why am I talking about myself right now?
22880	25800	Because the Switch release is pretty likely to happen at some point, and it's a happier
25800	28440	thought than the rest of the news involving Square Enix right now.
28440	29440	This is the Remake-O-Rama update.
29440	33040	Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to get derailed by
33040	36240	daylight and talk about the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now on the show
36240	38280	where every gamer has a voice.
38280	43800	Hello, my friends out there on the internet.
43800	48120	Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
48120	55400	It is Orange Lounge Radio, and we are live once again after a week off with episode number
55400	63520	950 of our show, a landmark number of sorts for tonight, March the 5th of 2023.
63520	67880	My name is Rob Roberts, and I'm here with you every week as are my co-hosts.
67880	70480	Say hello to Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.
70480	71680	What's up?
71680	72680	Hello.
72680	77600	Well, I say every week, but not last week, but that's my fault.
77600	79080	It wasn't a bad reason.
79080	80080	Yeah.
80080	83880	No, and as I've mentioned a few times on the show, I went on a cruise.
83880	88520	We were on a Star Trek themed cruise, and yeah, I'll tell you more about that in just
88520	95440	a minute, but unfortunately, the only downside to that is that by going on vacation and doing
95440	99840	a cruise and being in the airports and all that, Alan's feeling a little under weather
99840	100840	today.
100840	104900	We were supposed to meet Dark Sakura and one of our streamer friends who's in town, Nick
104900	105900	and Prince.
105900	107840	You and I both raid him a lot on our personal streams.
107840	109920	I'm sure a lot of our viewers are familiar with him at this point.
109920	111620	We were supposed to meet him for brunch today.
111620	116100	You got to meet him for brunch, but I didn't because we're erring on the side of Alan's
116100	117420	feeling a little under the weather.
117420	121660	It doesn't seem to be COVID yet, but we're just going to err on the side of caution.
121660	127380	And Nick seemed to appreciate that, so we just both hope that Alan gets to feeling better
127380	129060	soon and that you don't get it.
129060	131340	Yeah, for sure.
131340	135780	I completely realized there is a risk with doing fun things in the world, but we tried
135780	136780	our best.
136780	137780	We'll see.
137780	138780	We'll see what happens.
138780	144180	Maybe it could just be, you know, bodies are worn down from a week straight worth of partying
144180	148580	that honestly it could, it could just be a cold or something, you know, a little more,
148580	152680	a little more innocent, I suppose than what we've become used to over the last three years.
152680	155860	Are you aware that Brookfield's no longer has many loaves?
155860	158700	No, that's a tragedy.
158700	162980	It's an utter trash, but I did have a cranberry mimosa, so that was great.
162980	163980	That's good.
163980	164980	Did you get your soup?
165180	169260	No, I ended up because I made a whole bunch of soup yesterday and I'm going to eat that
169260	172380	up and then if I want, I'll go lemono, I'll go pick some up.
172380	173380	Yeah.
173380	174380	All right.
174380	176840	Well also say hello to a, I think also a fan of soup.
176840	178180	Say hello to Techmaster Loki.
178180	179180	Soup is good.
179180	181720	I've been known to have two soups in one meal.
181720	182720	Two soups?
182720	185140	That's an extra fancy meal.
185140	186140	Real raisin bran.
186140	187140	There's two soups.
187140	189180	Uh, what, what, what's your favorite soup?
189180	192540	Um, well, I like a good French onion soup.
192540	193540	Ah, oh.
194100	195100	On the cruise.
195100	201460	Cause you know, you get to eat in the main dining room and there's a French onion soup
201460	202460	that was so good.
202460	203460	Yeah.
203460	205380	That's one of my faves too.
205380	208600	But a good chicken tortilla, I think is always going to be one of my favorites.
208600	210340	And now creating a French onion soup.
210340	211340	My bad.
211340	212340	My bad.
212340	213340	My bad.
213340	214340	All right.
214340	218500	Well also say hello to all of you listening live as we do tape live every Sunday night
218500	222740	at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at the
222740	227500	voice of geeks network, twitch.tv slash a VOG network.
227500	231140	And you can chat along with our show if you're listening to us live over at twitch.tv slash
231140	237380	a VOG network where VX Jason XV chiming in on the soup says hot and sour soup is my jam.
237380	239140	I can't believe I forgot hot and sour soup.
239140	240140	That is the best.
240140	241140	Hot and sour soup is the best.
241140	242140	Yeah, I love it.
242140	243140	I love it.
243140	244140	But I, I,
244140	247260	Number one, avgolemono, number two, war wanton.
247260	251840	I do love war wanton and I know the vinegary part of hot and sour soup can really make
251840	253120	a hit and miss for people.
253120	258200	But when I'm sick, there's nothing I want more than hot and sour soup is number three.
258200	259200	So good.
259200	261200	Homemade chicken matzo soup.
261200	265480	The time potato soup is good too, especially for bacon.
265480	267100	I do love potato soup.
267100	271160	Since we're derailing this with soup, I will tell you about the soup I made.
271160	277640	Um, I, we had a rotisserie chicken and I keep a like vegetable scraps that are still good.
277640	283780	And I'll freeze them in, in my, uh, in my freezer and add them all into like a, a stock.
283780	287320	And so, but I didn't have very many, just like the ends of a couple of onions and like
287320	288320	a basil leaf.
288320	294040	So I threw that in there, threw in some fresh trimmings from my Rosemary Oregano thyme.
294040	299300	Um, and I took all the chicken off the rotisserie chicken and put that in the fridge.
299300	306240	And then I cooked down all the bones for about four hours into a really good, rich bone stock.
306240	309040	And then I strained all the bones out and threw all that away.
309040	313440	And I added in another thing of chicken stock that I happen to have because I needed it
313440	314440	loaded up.
314440	319320	So what is in this soup is a dark meat and white meat rotisserie chicken.
319320	322580	So it's nice and tender and not at all dry.
322580	325280	It's got charred leek.
325280	329000	And then the mirepoix that, you know, you have to have that first for soup it's, which
329000	333440	is onion, carrot and a celery.
333440	335600	And my soup is fucking delightful.
335600	338720	Now I want soup, but I did this to myself.
338720	339720	Congrats.
339720	340720	I played myself.
340720	345120	Um, so, uh, I make a good chicken soup.
345120	348140	No cereal is not soup.
348140	350360	On a, on a programming type of note.
350360	352840	So I did mention the Star Trek cruise.
352840	353840	That is where I was at.
353840	356220	And you might be wondering what the hell is a Star Trek cruise?
356220	357680	What makes it different than a regular cruise?
357680	361980	And the short answer is the celebrities in the shows, but the long answer, I'm going
361980	364260	to do a special stream here at VOG network.
364260	367400	We haven't been able to do a lot of special programming outside of Sunday nights, but
367400	370980	I really want to try to get correcting the course on that.
370980	377620	So Thursday here at VOG network at about five 30 Pacific eight 30 Eastern, um, captain Matt,
377620	383200	formerly of the starboard power coupling formerly, formerly grandpa Warcraft from courthouse,
383200	386660	who was also on the cruise with me and, and essentially was the one that got me to start
386660	390700	going on the cruise will be joining me for a special stream on Thursday night to talk
390700	392220	all about the cruise.
392220	396620	Even if you could give a shit about the star Trek cruise, we're going to play Overwatch
396620	398700	together live on stream.
398700	400420	He plays competitively.
400420	409260	I don't so it's, and if you've ever heard Matt and I interacting, you know, he can sometimes
409260	411700	get very frustrated with me when I'm a baddie.
411700	414160	So I'm sure it'll be fun for nothing else, but for that.
414160	417740	So check that out Thursday here at the voice geeks network, uh, we will, uh, remind you
417740	422920	on our discord server over at vog network.com slash discord.
422920	427620	Of course, before that show, uh, I think that's all the plugs out of the way, uh, before I
427620	431900	get to the kickoff topic tonight, which I'll ask Loki about in a minute, um, Loki, I do
431900	436460	want to ask about, cause it was noted in the chat that you're, you have some type of like
436460	440820	Jurassic park on rails shooter playing behind you live tonight, because you can see the
440820	443380	video when you watch us here at Twitch TV.
443380	447380	And I'm, I am even, I'm curious, I don't know this drastic park game that's playing behind
447380	448380	you.
448380	452180	I saw the logo, so I know it's drastic park and not some Dino world knockoff, but what,
452180	453280	what is this?
453280	456860	It is the staple of most modern arcades nowadays.
456860	460500	It's Jurassic park, the arcade by Roth reels.
460500	463760	It's it is an on a rail shooter, Jurassic park game.
463760	464760	Got it.
464760	467020	It's like my, my youngest son's favorite game at the arcade.
467020	468020	Is it?
468020	469020	Okay.
469020	470520	I was kind of curious why you picked that game.
470520	475560	You know, I w I was a little bummed to miss the shenanigans that a dark soccer Nick Prince
475560	480060	were up to earlier today because the, the play, I guess it's okay for me to say that
480060	482480	cause you're, you're done now.
482480	487800	So it's not like listeners can go find you, but the, the place where they met up was Brookfield's,
487800	490620	the little restaurant in front of Roseville golf land.
490620	494400	And I was thinking, Oh, wouldn't it be a hoot if dark soccer and I went over to Roseville
494400	502420	golf land after and took some sad face movies on the show of our old stomping grounds instead
502420	503800	of Roseville golf land.
503800	505600	Oh, that's probably smart.
505600	509160	Um, and Nick was talking about having played that Minecraft game there, but we went to
509160	510160	target.
510160	511160	Oh, Tarshay.
511160	512160	Good times.
512160	513160	Did some adulting.
513160	514160	Oh my gosh.
514160	515160	Fun.
515160	516920	Well, I are sheets.
516920	517920	You know, what's funny.
517920	520760	I also had to do a target run before my cruise.
520760	521760	Thank God.
521760	526580	My sister lives in long beach and was able to play chauffeur because I did not pack the
526580	530320	guard for my Clippers.
530320	534280	So I had to go to target and get a cheap thing of Clippers, which we kind of needed a new
534280	538540	one anyway, which whatever, just because I forgot the guard and I didn't want, uh, Alan
538540	543360	has a big bushy beard, which is very handsome, but, um, I, mine will grow uneven.
543360	547840	It will be very ugly if I don't keep it, uh, uh, even so.
547840	548840	Yeah.
548840	549840	Yeah.
549840	556080	Well, um, one of the things though, is that, you know, that like the part of Roseville
556080	563960	closer to the, the freeway is like my old, my old stomping grounds, like used to shop
563960	565520	at that Trader Joe's over there.
565520	571000	Um, and so when I dropped Nick off, I actually went over there and went back to, it's called
571000	573000	the Oriental market.
573000	575400	It's very, very lots of good Filipino food.
575400	578360	Like you can get all kinds of frozen lumpia and everything.
578360	582040	And I bought Ube rolls and I'm super happy.
582040	584760	Is that in the same shopping center as Trader Joe's?
584760	585960	It's a bit down the street.
585960	586960	Okay.
586960	591600	Cause I was like, when I, when I was a kid growing up there, none of that was to say,
591600	592600	like it wasn't even Trader Joe's.
592600	595360	It was something else that I don't even remember what it was, but it wasn't Trader Joe's.
595360	597160	So it was just, yeah.
597160	599800	There were some things that were still there.
599800	603960	Like they were poor, like the same Starbucks is there, but I was happy.
603960	608480	The one thing, which was a chubby diner for the record, not a Starbucks, the thing that
608480	612720	makes me a little bit sad though, is that when I went in, the ladies working didn't
612720	619960	have on Filipino dramas, which are hilarious to watch if you don't understand the language.
619960	620960	I bet.
620960	621960	All right.
621960	625020	Well, let's get into some games and talk about some of the things from this week and maybe
625020	626560	some of the things we missed as well.
626560	628760	We'll invite your topics a little later on in the show.
628760	632340	I think most of our news tonight is from the past week, but if there's something we missed
632340	635520	from two weeks ago, you really want us to touch on, we'll get to that during the listener
635520	637180	round table a little bit later.
637180	641680	But for now, let's talk about the story we talk about every week, every week.
641680	648280	It's the ongoing soap opera that is the acquisition of Activision by Microsoft.
648280	653240	But there's some interesting developments this week that are worth talking about here.
653240	654240	Yes.
654240	661320	According to Reuters, the European Commission is considered likely to approve the acquisition
661320	664160	of Activision Blizzard by Microsoft.
664160	669680	That's surprising actually, because I wonder what changed because all the predictions were
669680	672720	saying that they weren't going to approve that.
672720	676560	And I don't know if maybe some of the concessions or the Nintendo announcement or some of these
676560	680180	like Call of Duty, I'd be very curious.
680180	682040	And granted, I could have just missed some of this.
682040	684660	I've been out of the loop on the news, full disclosure.
684660	689600	Like when I was on the boat, I'm not sitting there reading Twitter or social, any form
689600	693660	of social media and keeping it on top of the gaming news.
693660	694940	I'm enjoying the cruise.
694940	698720	So I don't know if something swung the pendulum hard the other direction, but it's fascinating
698720	702160	to me that all of the needles were they're going to say no, they're going to say no.
702160	706560	And now it's they're going to say yes, because I think if they say yes, I think Europe was
706560	709120	more likely to say no than America, quite frankly.
709120	710120	I'm sorry.
710120	716520	Now I have Madeline Kahn in my head going, no, no, no, no, no, no, yes.
716520	721520	I think it's probably they've been showing that, you know, they are committed to putting
721520	725360	their games out multi platform, like with these different deals that they're doing with
725360	730840	like Nvidia, Steam, Nintendo.
730840	734560	So it's I don't know.
734560	740140	I think it's probably some goodwill there, at least with making those moves and probably
740140	741140	further looking.
741140	745120	I mean, honestly, like if you look in the Sony, like they do the same stuff like we
745120	749800	like are you really going to say like that they don't pay for exclusives and stuff like
749800	750800	that?
750800	751800	Like they do that all the time.
751800	752800	Like in.
752800	754720	So it'd be interesting to see what comes out of that.
754720	758920	Speaking of which, one of the things that may come out of that is revealing what Sony
758920	763380	actually pays for exclusives because they are making deals with different companies
763380	765440	to bring games over there.
765440	770620	And part of that argument is that they are paying to have games not only on their service,
770620	774900	but also paying to keep them off of Game Pass.
774900	778840	Which you know, it kind of shows that they're being a little anti competitive, if you ask
778840	782320	me, or maybe they are being competitive, I don't know.
782320	786940	But it is interesting, especially like, I just think the whole back and forth with them
786940	790920	like saying, Well, you know, we just won't have the competitive advantage anymore.
790920	795480	It's like, really, like, if that, if that didn't go through, they would totally try
795480	799560	to buy Activision, they would do the same thing.
799560	804040	And of course, going along with that, you know, we still have Phil Spencer still downplaying
804040	809680	the whole acquisition thing saying basically that if, you know, it doesn't, you know, end
809680	815640	up going through that Xbox will still exist, you know, they're going to still be there.
815640	820560	You know, it's not some sort of linchpin for their long term plan or whatever, which is
820560	821560	true.
821560	824200	I mean, they've got tons of different publishers already.
824200	830240	Yeah, I just think it's all just strategic right now trying to get the acquisition to
830240	834640	go through and we'll see what actually happens.
834640	837520	What's developing in court, though, is very interesting.
837520	838520	That's for sure.
838520	843320	There's, you know, now it's the whole trying to get Sony to show their cards too, right?
843320	848840	It's I, I'm kind of surprised and I'm, you know, I'm going to be fully honest, I'm not
848840	852360	sure how this all works in civil court.
852360	854720	But I and I'm not a lawyer, right?
854720	859160	You know, so I'm fully willing to admit my ignorance, which a lot of people that talk
859160	860960	about video games aren't willing to do.
860960	863040	So I'm just putting that on the table up front.
863040	864040	Okay.
864040	868840	I would think that in a civil court, a judge could like gag order some of these secrets
868840	871560	that yes, they need to be discussed in the courtroom.
871560	875160	But there's going to be a gag order on it so that these secrets don't get released outside
875160	876160	the courtroom.
876160	878800	And I don't know if there's just a concern that somebody is going to leak it or what's
878800	879800	what's going on.
879800	880800	I mean,
880800	886160	could they I don't know if the European Union has like an equivalent of like, Freedom of
886160	892920	Information Act type requests or whatever, where you can do that, like to reveal the
892920	894400	secrets, I guess, if you will.
894400	898260	Yeah, but some secrets to I think about all the things that the former president's been
898260	902600	doing in court, and there's a lot of it and all the redacted documents that come out of
902600	903600	that granted.
903600	905880	Now, I do know a lot of that is criminal.
905880	908320	And because of who it involves, you know,
908320	911400	it's also ongoing, like, you know, stuff.
911400	916080	So like, if it's done, then that would probably be released.
916080	917080	I could see that.
917080	919720	It's like national security stuff.
919720	922940	I guess, yeah, video games are not national security, believe it or not.
922940	928240	So no matter what Sony and Microsoft, you believe they're not that important.
928240	933820	Do I mean, does the public I'm going to ask a really weird question here.
933820	937680	Does the public have a right to know what Sony's paying for this stuff?
937680	942480	I kind of think the public should know some of this stuff.
942480	945820	Like, you know, I don't think it changes anything at the end of the day.
945820	948800	It's not like somebody's gonna be like, well, I'm not gonna buy a PlayStation five because
948800	949960	Sony does this.
949960	954560	I kind of feel like some of this transparency ought to be out on the table.
954560	955560	I don't know.
955560	963040	Yeah, because it gives the impression like, assuming that say you it's it's, I don't think
963040	970560	anyone's really thinking this like, you know, like with I don't know, like, basically, what
970560	974920	I'm saying is, like, if you take like a game, then put it like, if I'm picking a specific
974920	979400	platform to release it on, you could, you know, draw the conclusion like, well, I picked
979400	983840	the better platform to release it on, because I think this is a stronger platform overall.
983840	988400	But if you don't see that there's a money being exchanged, or how much money is being
988400	992940	exchanged, you might think, Oh, well, you know, this platform is just better.
992940	996160	That's why I mean, sure, they may have paid a little bit, but like, this platform is just
996160	999240	better because that's why they're that's why Square is choosing to release their games
999240	1000820	on Sony's platform.
1000820	1004880	But if it ends up, it's like, Oh, yeah, but they're also getting like, $200 million or
1004880	1008800	I don't know, you know, just some stupid amount, like $20 million to release their
1008800	1013600	game on that platform that may all of a sudden kind of bring a little bit more clarity to
1013600	1016800	it, whether it's like, well, it's not really a better platform, it's just that they just
1016800	1018460	paid him a ton of money to do that.
1018460	1024340	So it's, it is important, I think, to have some of that transparency there, because yeah,
1024340	1026920	it does kind of skew things a bit.
1026920	1030240	You may think, Oh, well, it, you know, it's because they're good guys.
1030240	1034280	No, no, not necessarily.
1034280	1036040	Nobody's good in capitalism.
1036040	1037040	Nobody's
1037040	1038040	no, no.
1038040	1039040	Yeah.
1039040	1040040	And the game industry and all that stuff.
1040040	1041040	Yeah.
1041040	1042040	Um, let's see.
1042040	1044680	Let's get some comments from chat over twitch.tv slash a vog network.
1044680	1049680	DJ Rama S says Sony's dirty laundry is about to be aired and I am here for it.
1049680	1053240	There are a lot of people that seem to be bringing the marshmallows and the chocolate
1053240	1056120	and the graham crackers to what's about to happen in court.
1056120	1059420	I don't I mean, like, again, I just see it as like a transparency thing.
1059420	1063320	I don't I don't think Sony's gonna get raked over the coals for it.
1063360	1065120	Like, everybody's gonna forget about it.
1065120	1067100	It's gonna be just a little embarrassing.
1067100	1072000	Like they're, they're gonna have to show their ass figuratively and somewhat literally.
1072000	1073600	And it's gonna be a little embarrassing.
1073600	1075480	But at the end of the day, it's just an ass.
1075480	1077280	It's just business, right?
1077280	1082160	So we know they're probably paying an obscene questionable amount of money for this or this
1082160	1085180	would be under discussion in the first place.
1085180	1086600	That's kind of my take on it.
1086600	1088440	DJ Rama S also says it's crazy.
1088440	1092360	I know people that will sell their PS fours and fives if the deal goes through.
1093360	1095960	No, they're not gonna sell a play.
1096480	1100040	People say the wildest shit when you put a keyboard and a monitor in front of them.
1100040	1101800	People say the wildest shit.
1102120	1102600	You know what?
1102600	1105320	If they do it, I say buy it off of them, get a good deal.
1106040	1108440	I also offer half of what it's worth.
1108440	1113800	Who cares what a person like who cares what someone does with their console or not?
1113800	1118240	Like, do we really need to be in the loop if someone sells their console or buys a console or
1118480	1120120	like has an opinion on about something?
1120120	1121000	Like, I don't care.
1121000	1121800	It doesn't matter.
1121960	1123240	It does not matter at all.
1123240	1125520	Someone on the Internet has an opinion?
1125960	1127120	They're shouting this.
1127120	1129400	They're making threats like anybody cares.
1129440	1130640	Nobody cares.
1130640	1132040	Nobody, you know?
1134000	1134720	Sorry, Rama.
1134720	1141000	I know you call them your friends, but it's just like a real friend will tell you when you're acting like a fool.
1143120	1145920	It's just it's it's bad.
1145960	1146680	Like, I don't know.
1146680	1150200	Like it to me, it's just it's like that scene at Jurassic Park.
1150200	1151200	See, no one cares.
1151200	1151960	No one cares.
1151960	1154440	You know, we shout it from the rooftop.
1154440	1155120	No one cares.
1155920	1158360	The only people that care, the other people, they're just like that.
1158720	1161640	So they can stick in their own little click and be stupid together.
1161640	1162360	I don't really care.
1163080	1163720	See, it's very.
1164200	1164680	Oh, go ahead.
1165320	1169360	I was going to say, like, there's literally nothing like like I always dog on like Nintendo.
1169360	1171560	Like there's literally nothing Nintendo could do.
1172040	1174680	OK, well, almost nothing Nintendo could do.
1174720	1184640	I mean, like if they came out and said, Hey, we hate all trans people and like burn in hell, everybody, then yeah, then I may be more, you know, motivated to sell my console that I have from them.
1184880	1186680	But like, yikes, hyperbole.
1187160	1194120	I mean, but like aside from that, like just business decisions, like if they purchase Konami or something like that, you know, good luck with them.
1194840	1195880	Like, I just wouldn't care.
1195880	1199000	Like, it wouldn't be anything that they could do.
1199960	1205000	Business wise, are you saying Nintendo could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and would never be held accountable for it?
1206360	1208480	I mean, that's what he's saying, isn't it?
1209680	1211680	I mean, I don't know, probably.
1211880	1217960	And unfortunately, as much disdain as I have for the reference I just made, he wasn't wrong.
1217960	1218680	Clearly.
1220680	1222640	That's like the one thing he wasn't wrong on.
1222640	1225120	It's just the insane idiots that follow him don't care.
1225120	1226920	So, you know, but they don't care about anything.
1227560	1229560	Anyway, back to chat comments.
1229600	1230360	Get us back on track.
1230360	1237160	Sia Tabiri says Hoegh Law, H-O-E-G Law on YouTube does a great job of going through some of the legal aspects of this.
1238120	1238600	Great.
1238840	1239920	I'll have to check that out.
1239920	1244440	Although I always prefer reading it as opposed to having to watch a 10 minute YouTube, but I get it.
1244440	1246400	It's 2023 and I need to stop being old.
1246400	1257520	Questbuster says, a side note, the EU is giving the deal its blessing due to the concessions being made, and Microsoft is apparently not expected to sell certain assets to make it happen.
1257760	1260840	But UK regulators are still concerned over the deal.
1261000	1263320	A ruling isn't expected until April.
1263320	1271880	Making a distinction here between EU and the UK, which remember, if you heard the word Brexit, those are two very different things right now.
1271880	1275680	So good clarification there on that.
1276520	1279920	And as Joan had a map mentions, personal information can be sealed.
1280160	1282360	Everything else is public record.
1282520	1283680	At least it should be.
1283680	1287400	That's that's we are talking about publicly traded companies.
1287680	1289520	That is a good perspective on that.
1289520	1290440	So thank you for that.
1292120	1299840	Questbuster says Sony's deals will make news like when people found out about how much Epic paid for their exclusives during their bout with Apple.
1300040	1306040	Oh, yeah, I remember there's a big spreadsheet from Epic that made the news and then it was like, wow, and then it was gone.
1306040	1308000	And I bet people hardly remember it.
1308000	1312520	And it's going to be the same thing with Sony is like, wow, it's your ass.
1312520	1315760	And then everybody will forget the next week because that's the way the Internet works.
1315760	1323680	Just like anyone remember when, you know, PlayStation online was down for, you know, a couple months or whatever years ago, like anybody remember that?
1323680	1324560	Yes. Yes.
1324560	1327920	No, that was Sony showing hole when that happened.
1327920	1335040	That was that was the black hole of PlayStation Network when that whole thing happened and everybody forgot that.
1335040	1336320	So there it is.
1338240	1342400	Let's see, as Joe and Matt says, but this is all part of business.
1342520	1347160	If the roles were reversed, Microsoft will be making heck for Sony if they were buying ABK.
1347360	1353800	One difference I think Sony would not be as generous as Microsoft is with Call of Duty exclusivity.
1353960	1357120	And I know they would not absolutely not.
1357360	1359120	Absolutely not for sure.
1359720	1368200	So let's see, Zen Monkey 11 says, I said I wouldn't buy any more Xbox consoles after 360 and I still haven't.
1368440	1372000	I have an Xbox controller, though, and Game Pass, lol.
1372320	1378760	Well, that's not a total loss for Microsoft, but I think you're admitting to that in your own what you're saying there.
1378760	1379760	So I'll leave it at that.
1380760	1386920	Mike Deff says console wars do exist and we're seeing it with all this ordeal, but we're not the soldiers fighting it.
1386920	1388800	We're just the innocent bystanders.
1389000	1389920	Interesting person.
1390160	1392800	The console wars these days sure aren't what it used to be.
1392800	1399720	I remember the I'm sure all of us old gamers remember the full page ads, Genesis does what Intend don't and all those things.
1399920	1404520	And it definitely feels like the console wars aren't fought by marketing teams anymore.
1404520	1407640	They're fought by social media people and YouTube people.
1407640	1409120	And it's exhausting.
1409360	1415200	Like now we all look at that and go, this is even more ridiculous than some of those game ads we used to see.
1415200	1419480	And let me tell you, there were some ridiculous magazine game ads back in the day.
1419480	1422400	If you've not seen any, there's a whole internet out there.
1422400	1425200	Go look at some of these ridiculous game ads and tell me what you think.
1425600	1432640	So Bobby Black Wolf also says they want Xbox to be a platform, not a console.
1432840	1435600	The fact you have Game Pass means they got what they wanted from you.
1435600	1436080	Yes.
1436600	1440080	And Quest Buster says so much shade in those magazine ads.
1440080	1443040	I remember the Final Fantasy 7 ad that mocked cartridges.
1443240	1448120	Oh, yeah, it was always it was it was always something anyway.
1448160	1448560	All right.
1448680	1456240	Well, let's talk about the ads that worked on us as we talk about the video games that we've been playing this week in a segment called How Was Your Gaming Week?
1456400	1456920	Dark Soccer.
1456920	1459960	And if you want, you can do How Was Your Gaming two weeks because it has been a minute.
1460160	1461840	So Dark Soccer, how was your gaming week?
1463120	1465920	Well, it was the usual stuff.
1465920	1467480	There was some Dead by Daylight.
1468240	1472200	I tried to play Star Ocean, but my controllers kind of fucked up.
1473720	1481080	Like this that has served me well for like the last eight or nine years or no less than that, more like seven.
1481080	1482080	But anyway, it's been a while.
1482920	1486320	My right shoulder button's been out for a while and now it's making other buttons stick.
1486720	1488080	So I ordered another one.
1490080	1494800	And so I actually played Cult of the Lamb instead.
1494800	1497400	And it was it was nice revisiting Cult of the Lamb.
1498400	1502720	Have they done any content updates, patches, extra things to that game since the...
1502720	1507120	It's just that there's supposed to be a new a new DLC for it coming out.
1507280	1507800	Oh, cool.
1508640	1514120	So I'm hoping that it's it's going to be good.
1514120	1517520	Like they said, there's supposed to be like new buildings in the game that you can make.
1519360	1522320	So I'm still doing Dead by Daylight.
1522320	1524920	I hit Eerie four, which made me happy.
1525680	1527440	Um, thanks.
1528520	1536680	OK, and I made actually I made friends with somebody I bought stickers from on Etsy, who actually, for those who are watching, did this.
1537520	1538280	Oh, cute.
1538720	1545160	A little Susie and I have a pig that's at my at my desk at work and also did this.
1546120	1549000	Which is for the podcast, there's an artwork of the pig.
1549000	1552440	Yeah, but I bought some stickers and
1553440	1558120	the Kaim that my new friend has been swiffing with us.
1558120	1562280	So the the the team Yeet grows.
1564560	1567920	And what did I do?
1567920	1571680	I played some Midnight Suns, you know, kind of slowly easing my way back into it.
1571680	1575640	It's just being back to work has kind of broken my concentration for stuff.
1575640	1577800	So I'm like easing my brain back into things.
1577960	1580440	So, oh, yeah.
1580440	1583480	And I played a little bit more Beatlemania.
1584280	1586320	I love that table.
1586320	1593680	It's like the 1964 era of Beatles music, but it's done like one of those old school pinball tables.
1593680	1600280	It's got like the big curved end in the open play field and but with enough modern touches that it's really fresh.
1600720	1607320	And then we watched a thing, but I guess I'm talking about it later in the show, so I'll be quiet about it.
1608280	1610480	OK, fair enough. Yeah.
1610680	1613320	All right. Well, then with that, I'll go over to Loki.
1613320	1614880	How was your gaming week?
1614880	1617360	I just played Minecraft one edited video.
1617360	1622360	So like I had an episode come out on the 24th, I believe.
1622880	1625560	So my modded series and that was fun.
1625880	1629000	I built a starter house there
1629000	1632160	and then I've been working on
1633800	1635520	making flowers
1636520	1637600	in Minecraft.
1637600	1640240	OK. Oh, giant flowers.
1640880	1641720	All right.
1641720	1643960	I'll see what that's all about in your next video.
1644640	1648000	It's it's the new the new robot master.
1648000	1649080	Oh, actually, I'm sorry.
1649080	1651120	There was a whole lot of stuff that went on. OK.
1652200	1653440	So let me let me back up here.
1653440	1654560	So a few things.
1655920	1660120	So first off, I have my eight robot masters.
1660120	1661280	I part my series.
1661280	1667120	I'm building a Mega Man theme this on the season on the channel 64 S&P,
1668040	1670760	which is cool because I tried to pick like the beginning season.
1670960	1674320	I wanted to pick a unique
1674320	1677920	build theme style or whatever that nobody has done before,
1677920	1682440	because I knew like everybody picks like, you know, I do cyberpunk
1682440	1685800	or I'm going to do steampunk or cottage core or something like that.
1686320	1689040	So I was like, OK, Mega Man, no one's done Mega Man
1689080	1690120	because I've looked online.
1690120	1692320	All I see is like pixel art stuff that people copy.
1692640	1694720	No one's actually done Mega Man.
1694720	1698840	So I picked Mega Man and I have my eight robot masters
1698840	1703200	that commissioned and created custom robot masters based off of the mobs
1703200	1703880	in Minecraft.
1703880	1706120	So the second one I'm working on right now,
1706120	1708000	because I finished the area for the first one.
1708000	1710200	The second one is the axolotl woman.
1710200	1712200	And she is like super cute.
1712200	1716400	She's got like this robotic axolotl thing that looks really derpy.
1716400	1718960	Kind of almost looks like a duck billed platypus or something like that.
1720840	1722920	But her area has like giant flowers in it.
1722920	1726160	Originally, I was going to be basing it off of the hanging gardens of Babylon,
1726160	1728840	but then I put that together and it didn't quite look right.
1729200	1731480	It wasn't like robotic enough.
1731480	1735240	So I've started now with robotic flowers that are going to be basically
1735240	1738640	these giant solar arrays or solar panel arrays,
1739080	1742880	which look really cool, even though it took a week to put together.
1743680	1745040	But that aside,
1745040	1747560	so a couple of things happen while that was all going on.
1748480	1749040	So.
1750000	1754480	Mojang decided that, hey, we're going to put out some Mega Man X DLC for.
1754880	1756000	That's right.
1756000	1758120	Minecraft Bedrock.
1758120	1761320	So I was like, that sounds like an opportunity for me.
1761320	1764520	So I was like, OK, hey, hey, you like that DLC?
1764520	1765320	Well, guess what?
1765320	1768720	Like, I've been working on this stuff and it's also making me related.
1768720	1771600	And so I got, you know, some retweets and stuff like that.
1772120	1774320	A couple of the developers noticed as well.
1774920	1778120	Then they decided that they're going to do this new thing.
1778120	1780880	It's called a feature me Minecraft.
1781600	1784240	And what's the first theme that they pick?
1784880	1786400	It's Mega Man.
1786400	1789960	Who has Mega Man builds out the wazoo because he's been working on for six months?
1790120	1791080	This guy.
1791080	1794640	So it's going to there's a very good possibility
1794640	1797840	that I'll probably be featured on Minecraft's website here.
1797880	1799080	Oh, my God.
1799080	1803320	Finally, I'm so happy to see what have we been telling you
1803360	1804080	for the longest time.
1804080	1806160	You stick with it and there's going to be something
1806160	1808720	that finally comes through and helps you get that push in.
1809040	1810200	I know we'll see what that does.
1810200	1812120	I know we don't want to set the expectations too high,
1812120	1816040	but I mean, the fact that developers saw it, Loki, that's huge. That's huge.
1816600	1819400	Yeah. So like, yeah, it's pretty awesome.
1820000	1822360	So, yeah, I've been just plugging away at that stuff.
1822360	1825600	And I think I've got a good start, obviously,
1825600	1828560	because I've got some pretty big builds already that I've,
1828920	1832880	you know, captured in everything and, you know, tagged in that.
1832880	1835320	And there's not really I haven't really seen any other submissions
1835320	1836960	on Twitter yet.
1836960	1838800	And it ends in like 10 days.
1838800	1843000	So, I mean, oh, man, I'm so happy for you preemptively.
1843320	1845120	Maybe I need to calm down what.
1845120	1848440	But since that did come out during the week we were out, I'm kind of curious,
1848440	1850920	like, what are your thoughts in general on the Mega Man crossover?
1850920	1852560	Because it looks kind of cool.
1852560	1855320	Yeah, I'm like, I'm not a huge Minecraft guy like you are.
1855320	1857440	And I was like, oh, I should fire up Minecraft and check that out.
1857840	1859600	Yeah, it's they've been doing a lot of these
1859600	1862480	like different things where they'll have maps that they make
1862960	1865680	they're like DLCs, but it's basically maps that they make
1865680	1867960	that have different like gameplay like.
1867960	1870680	So they did one not that long ago of like Sonic.
1871120	1874240	And it actually plays a bit like Sonic, like you're running
1874600	1876560	really fast and stuff like that.
1876560	1879720	The Mega Man X one, I think, is similar to Mega Man X as well.
1879720	1882240	I think you can actually like shoot
1882240	1885160	your Buster and like even like a fight.
1885160	1887320	Some of the enemies of I haven't actually played the X.
1887320	1890760	I don't play a lot of bedrock, but I may have to check it out.
1890760	1891960	It looks pretty cool.
1891960	1894680	And the aesthetic was definitely, you know, Mega Man.
1894680	1896840	So I don't know.
1896840	1900120	I don't know how many of like the stages they recreated in there as well.
1900320	1902680	And that'd be kind of interesting because it's kind of 2D.
1902680	1904560	I'm not sure if they like fix the camera angles.
1904560	1905520	So it's like side scrolling
1905520	1908720	because in the trailer kind of look like is a little mix of both.
1908720	1910320	So maybe.
1910320	1913960	But I know all the updates that they've been doing for like 120 and stuff.
1913960	1916480	They're supposed to be coming out, I imagine pretty soon.
1917480	1919960	Having kind of based on like
1920000	1922200	adding more robust
1922200	1924960	customization for these map packs, because I mean,
1924960	1927680	that's really where their bread and butter is with that.
1927680	1930360	I mean, because they're not making money off the Java version of Minecraft.
1930360	1933000	You buy it once, like 10 years ago, and then that's it.
1933800	1939600	It's all the map and, you know, DLC and custom.
1940520	1943920	All sorts of things on their marketplace, on the bedrock side of things,
1943920	1946080	that's basically, you know, all the mobile platforms,
1946080	1949120	all the console platforms and, you know, PC as well.
1949120	1951520	But I mean, I get it. I get it.
1951520	1954680	So yeah, it'll be interesting to see what happens with that.
1955200	1957800	The very least, I got a few people looking at stuff.
1957800	1961240	I mean, like, I just think it's like you're like, you know, 2023,
1961240	1963920	like who actually goes out to the Minecraft website?
1963920	1965200	Like, I don't know.
1965200	1968880	So we'll see if they feature in like surprise different videos and stuff.
1968880	1970520	I mean, it'd be cool.
1970520	1972040	At least they'll be on there now.
1972040	1974400	So it also puts you in their orbit.
1974720	1975880	And that's true.
1975880	1977720	Yeah, that's that's the other important thing, too.
1977720	1980480	It gets you noticed by the people that can help elevate you.
1980480	1983360	It's it's I again, I'm trying not to put the cart before the horse.
1983360	1984240	Let's see what happens.
1984240	1987160	But I will I'm going to check your Twitter.
1987520	1990400	I'm not as good at checking Twitter
1990400	1992960	as I used to be for reasons I've talked about prior on this show.
1992960	1995720	I'm a little more on the Mastodon bandwagon at this point, but I'm
1996080	1999800	I will make it a point to check your Twitter regularly
1999800	2002000	to see what happens of this, because I'm dying to know.
2002440	2005720	Yeah, I mean, it's got was it the post that I responded
2005720	2008000	to their build challenge tweet.
2008000	2012400	It's got about 4100 views on it and like 85 likes.
2013080	2015080	Oh, that's that's great.
2015680	2017240	So, yeah, it's not bad.
2017240	2019560	OK. All right. All right.
2019920	2024080	Well, Loki's soon going to be the next big YouTuber and he's going to
2025640	2027040	going to say, fuck this show.
2027040	2028000	I'm big timer now.
2028000	2029720	No, I'm kidding. He wouldn't. I know he wouldn't. All right.
2031080	2033840	All right. Hey, done, done, done, done.
2034320	2037280	All right. Moving on, I'll talk quickly.
2037520	2039000	I'm assuming that's it for your gaming week.
2039000	2040480	I mean, yeah, that's it.
2040480	2043520	That's a pretty difficult thing to follow up my gaming week.
2043520	2045040	I didn't play a lot of games this week.
2045040	2048280	Y'all know why I was focusing on just having a good time on the boat
2048280	2049120	and being social.
2049120	2051720	I met a lot of new people, but we'll get into that on Thursday.
2052600	2056440	But when I got home, because we've been home since Friday,
2056440	2057600	it was a Friday to Friday cruise.
2057600	2059360	So we've been home since Friday.
2059360	2061920	I have been playing quite a bit of Diablo three.
2062440	2063440	Yep, I'm back on that.
2063440	2068040	But because they put out a brand new season last week while I was out of town.
2068280	2071560	So season twenty eight started and the big new thing was season
2071560	2073680	twenty eight is that they have this new altar.
2073680	2076520	So they have like a talent progression thing on the altar,
2076520	2080240	which is similar to what Diablo four has in store.
2080240	2083480	So it's a little bit of a tie in to Diablo four's release because this
2083760	2085960	they haven't said this is the last season.
2086520	2089160	But my assumption is season 30
2089480	2093160	will probably be like a good number for them to end on,
2093160	2094880	which would be like that forever.
2094880	2098320	So they'll find a mechanic that they can run perpetually at that point.
2098960	2101000	So they're probably getting closer and closer to that.
2101000	2102880	But I am having fun with Diablo three.
2102880	2104680	Some of the builds have changed a lot.
2104680	2106040	It's kind of added some new things.
2106040	2110560	It's really fast to level now because the first talent you get doubles
2110560	2111760	the massacre bonus.
2111760	2115240	What's called is when you kill a lot of enemies in succession.
2115400	2119120	And so if you just kind of grind these certain maps, you can level up very fast.
2119360	2121200	So, yeah, I've just been enjoying Diablo three.
2121200	2124120	But honestly, that's like the only game I've really played since I got back.
2124560	2127720	Oh, I did play one round of Dead by Daylight last night, one round
2127720	2129520	to get my challenge done.
2129520	2133160	I had to sabo four hooks and get chased as Kate Denson.
2133600	2136840	But I was up against a Wesker who couldn't chase and never chase
2136840	2139240	me the entire match.
2139240	2141080	So I saboed my hooks, though.
2141080	2143600	Yeah, it was a baby, but that's OK.
2144880	2147160	When I see babies, you know what I do?
2147200	2149840	I don't teabag. I just leave the fucking match.
2149880	2152160	That's what I do when I see babies.
2152160	2155320	I've noticed, though, like a lot of baby killers these days.
2155360	2157120	Yeah. And I'm a baby killer, too.
2157120	2162440	So, well, I mean, but I'm more like my thing is like
2163360	2166640	like I've seen them do the camping crap.
2167400	2169600	Oh, so I will stay afterwards.
2169600	2172360	And if there if there's something I can communicate with,
2173080	2175360	I will usually let them have it.
2175360	2179880	This this Wesker tried to camp the final hook after the exits were open,
2179880	2181640	but actually allowed.
2181640	2185000	Actually, he did get one of the survivors out because they fucked around
2185000	2189760	and found out and they they got slammed into the exit gate.
2189760	2192320	They forgot that Wesker can slam you into the exit gate.
2192760	2194680	That was and that was not the play.
2194680	2196800	They fucked around. They found out. So.
2196800	2199640	Exactly. You know, but you know what I say?
2199640	2203920	You know the when the gates are open, all bets are off. Yeah. Yeah.
2205360	2207080	So anyway, that was really it for my gaming week.
2207080	2209000	You know, another big thing that I missed this week,
2209000	2211440	No Man's Sky put out a new expedition.
2211440	2212880	I do plan to check that out.
2212880	2215840	I'm going to stream that on Tuesday on my personal channel for a little bit.
2216600	2218760	But yeah, otherwise,
2220520	2221320	I didn't get it.
2221320	2226760	That's the first time that I've ever missed a No Man's Sky Twitch drops campaign.
2226960	2230640	I've been I've collected every reward from every other Twitch campaign.
2230640	2233800	I missed this one completely because I was on a boat.
2234680	2236040	So that's that.
2236040	2238760	So before we get anything to be sorry.
2238760	2240920	No, it really isn't. It really isn't.
2240920	2243800	And I'll tell you more on Thursday. I'm on a boat.
2244120	2246480	Yeah. Yeah. I'll tell you more on Thursday.
2246480	2248400	Just the celebrities they had this year were great.
2248400	2250520	So personable, approachable.
2250520	2252920	Like I'll give you a little tease.
2252920	2256760	I know you you interviewed Todd Stashwick on a podcast
2256760	2258440	some time ago and have kept in touch.
2258440	2260560	He was extremely well received by the crowd.
2260560	2264440	He did a great job with like he introduced the new episode of Picard,
2264800	2266880	which we got to watch in a big group.
2267160	2269480	And it was it was like being at the Rocky Horror Picture Show.
2269480	2271360	But Star Trek, it was great.
2271360	2273640	And like, I'm not going to spoil anything that happened in the episode,
2273640	2276840	but I will just say there is there is Crusher
2277160	2279360	and there's a doctor who's not as likable.
2279600	2283320	And when the doctor who's not as likable showed up, somebody in the back went,
2283800	2286520	bitch, everybody started laughing.
2287200	2290160	So it's like Pulaski.
2290200	2291440	No, no, no. It's not Pulaski.
2291440	2292760	It's because it's Pulaski.
2292760	2294320	No, no, it's somebody completely different.
2294320	2296600	So again, I don't want to spoil.
2296600	2300720	So, oh, no, no, it's I don't think you would know it's different.
2301000	2303080	So anyway, I'll just leave it at that.
2303080	2304800	For those that are watching Picard, you'll get it.
2304800	2306840	For those that aren't, you won't. And that's the point.
2307760	2309800	But it was really fun to watch that at a crowd.
2309800	2313960	And I will say the last night of the cruise,
2314560	2317520	Tawny Newsome, who voices Mariner on Lower Decks,
2317920	2320720	she is on fire with her improv.
2320760	2321920	She's so good.
2321920	2324720	But she was a late add to the cruise because she was the other one
2324720	2326400	they added when Kate Mulgrew backed out.
2326400	2330400	So when Kate Mulgrew had to back out, they added Shatner and Tawny Newsome.
2330440	2332360	Yay. Tawny Newsome.
2332360	2334840	You can tell that they must have went to her and said,
2335120	2337480	what event do you want to host on the boat?
2337480	2339600	You can do anything you want. What do you want to do?
2339600	2342960	So the last night of the cruise, I went to a Beyonce
2342960	2346240	Renaissance album dance party hosted by Tawny Newsome.
2347200	2349880	That sounded amazing.
2349880	2353240	I will treasure those types of moments forever.
2353520	2358360	That is it was it was everything like I literally had to sit down and go.
2358960	2360280	Is this real life?
2360280	2361600	This is incredible.
2361600	2363640	So more stories like that on Thursday.
2363640	2364960	I'll leave you with that tease.
2364960	2367280	So that's pretty awesome.
2367280	2369800	Also, I will mention I forgot
2369800	2372840	I was going to bring this up on the toss call with Bobby Black Wolf,
2373360	2375240	but we can talk about it more in depth next week.
2375240	2377480	But I will just also confirm
2377480	2381240	Bobby and myself will be at Dragon Con 2023.
2381240	2382400	I mean, no surprise there, right?
2382400	2384160	You kind of knew that was coming.
2384160	2387280	Just confirming we are both going to be professional
2387560	2390800	attending professionals once again, which means we will have a variety of panels
2391360	2394400	that you can come watch and do all the good stuff with. And
2395320	2397680	I know this is going to 100 percent happen
2397680	2401080	because the flights have been booked as of this last week.
2401480	2404560	Alan is going to his first Dragon Con this year.
2404600	2408040	So it's not just and it's not just me going, it's Alan going.
2408040	2411000	And I'm I'm trying to talk Alan into doing a panel.
2411120	2415440	But he's he he's not there yet mentally, but I'm hoping I can get him there.
2415440	2417680	I would love for him to just be a panelist on one panel.
2417920	2419120	I think he would be so good.
2419120	2420840	So we'll see. I'm going to try.
2420840	2421840	I'm going to keep trying.
2421840	2425680	But look forward to that in Atlanta over Labor Day weekend.
2425680	2426880	So there's that.
2426880	2430120	So D.J. Rama says, is Alan cosplaying?
2430560	2433480	That's a great question, actually.
2434880	2436480	Not yet.
2436480	2440240	But I think Alan and I are going to need to invest in some Starfleet uniforms
2440240	2444200	because we already booked for next year's Star Trek Cruise.
2446200	2450560	So so no show February 20 something 2024.
2450640	2453120	Just get that out there now.
2453120	2456200	The same week in February next year, you're you're going to have off again.
2458080	2463120	Still, I think that you should show DS9 some love because it was the best.
2463400	2465880	This whole cruise was DS9 love.
2465880	2468440	I have a photo with the cast of DS9. I'll have to show it to you.
2469080	2470280	It was great.
2470280	2473960	And we got to do we got to do a charity breakfast with Chase Masterson,
2473960	2476600	who played Lita on a lot of episodes.
2476600	2480400	And she she does a great anti-bullying charity called Be Kind.
2480400	2482680	And she talks a lot about that. Anyway, I'm getting off track.
2483000	2484880	Join us Thursday. We'll talk more about that.
2484880	2486640	But yes, Deep Space Nine was well represented
2486640	2488600	because they were it was the 30th anniversary.
2488600	2491480	So they had a lot of the cast there. It was really cool.
2491600	2493360	That's absolutely my favorite series.
2493360	2497120	It's it's it's interesting how that series is getting a lot more love now.
2497120	2501520	They're saying that streaming really helped that series out a lot
2501520	2504080	and get the credit that it deserved, that it wasn't getting before.
2504080	2505000	It's very interesting.
2506520	2509520	Let's see. Jaskren says hell yeah to Alan being there.
2509520	2511040	I know Jaskren goes to Dragon Con.
2511040	2513040	Yeah, I'm really excited about that, too, as well.
2513920	2519120	YYR asking kind of a out of the blue question, but I like this.
2519120	2522000	So let me ask this question before or answer this question
2522000	2523920	before we get into the stories tonight.
2524120	2528240	YYR says, did anyone else catch the DDR tournament
2528240	2530800	last night on the Ohio DDR Twitch channel?
2530920	2532600	It was mind blowing.
2532600	2536720	The new players coming on up to the pinnacle of human skill are just amazing.
2536880	2539160	And my short answer is no.
2539160	2542400	But my long answer is I wish I'd known about it and I would have.
2542440	2544760	But probably because, again, I'd been out for a week.
2544760	2546800	Of course, I didn't know about it.
2546800	2550680	But I do think it's fascinating that because these things can be streamed,
2550960	2552000	you know, I think back.
2552000	2556120	OK, so I was like, they didn't really stream DDR contest back in the day.
2556120	2558400	You had to wait for the videos to be published later.
2558400	2562960	But remember the DDR tournament at Pier 39?
2562960	2564600	It was called B3.
2564600	2567600	There was a live stream of that tournament. Who did it?
2568920	2570600	Us at Orange Launch Radio.
2570600	2573000	It's our first major on location event.
2573000	2577520	Run off off with with a mutual friend for lunch.
2578320	2581960	And I think that was when we gave the microphone to Jahi, if you remember him.
2581960	2584160	And he just he just ran the show for like two hours.
2584160	2586560	And I'm sure it was amazing.
2586560	2589240	I miss that guy, too. So funny.
2589240	2593640	But anyway, what else is it going to say about that tournament?
2593680	2596160	Oh, there was no video back then because this is ancient times.
2596160	2598160	It was like 2004. We didn't have the Internet for video.
2598160	2601160	So it was like audio only. But it was really, really fun.
2601160	2604520	And YYR says there were 900 people watching live towards the end.
2604520	2606480	So this got noticed. That's awesome.
2606480	2609880	I really want to see some DDR tournaments on Twitch.
2609880	2611000	I think that's a great thing.
2611000	2615040	And we know that DDR and dance games in general have been getting more visibility
2615200	2618800	because of things like Games Done Quick that have done the showcases on Twitch and so forth.
2618800	2621720	And not just that. There's been, you know, tournaments and lots of things.
2621720	2626640	And, you know, even us olds in our 40s can that we're back.
2626720	2628320	We're into DDR back in the day.
2628320	2632160	We all recognize there's some new get there's some up and coming kids now.
2632400	2634640	There's some new kids up and coming.
2635200	2637000	Do not saying we used to do.
2637000	2640120	And I think it's great. I'm glad the DDR is thriving.
2640120	2644320	And I realize that, you know, round one's resurgence, getting more arcade machines out there
2644320	2648320	and so forth have really helped give that game a new tailwind.
2648320	2650560	And I think it's great. So, yeah.
2650560	2653320	And Freestyle Takeover always streams that stuff. Yep, yep, yep.
2653760	2655840	So awesome. Awesome.
2655840	2659080	Yes. Please do ping the discord if you catch one of those in progress later on.
2659560	2661240	All right. Let's move on.
2661240	2663360	Let's get into some of the other news we missed this week.
2663360	2669120	And we will go to Loki for tonight's story, which isn't directly about video games,
2669480	2672720	but it kind of is. It's super adjacent.
2672760	2677600	No, I have a follow up story to this from my trip, but I'm going to let you tell this.
2678080	2681240	I mean, when you think about it, though, what what
2682240	2686200	retail store carries the majority of these?
2687160	2689280	It's a game store. It's GameStop.
2689560	2693600	And we're talking about Funko Pops. GameStop's number one export nowadays.
2693920	2699560	And Funko Pops maybe not doing as well as they had hoped.
2700000	2704600	But apparently there is going to be 30 million
2704680	2707400	dollars worth of Funko Pops heading to a landfill.
2707400	2709320	It's like it's 1983 all over again.
2709360	2712600	And we're burying, you know, E.T. in landfills.
2712600	2715560	But no, they're going to be,
2715840	2719320	I guess, dumping those because they're not able to sell them off.
2719880	2724600	The inventory at the end of year totaled 20 or 246.4 million,
2724840	2727640	an increase of 48 percent compared to a year ago.
2728320	2731760	And says the inventory or this includes inventory that the company intends
2731760	2735720	to eliminate in the first half of 2023 to reduce fulfillment costs
2735720	2739120	by managing inventory levels to align with the operating
2739400	2742040	operating capacity of our distribution center,
2742200	2745680	because it costs money to store things in a warehouse.
2745680	2749880	So therefore, it's best for them to get rid of those things in a warehouse
2750400	2752920	or just, you know, don't manufacture them in the first place.
2753040	2757320	Oh, they actually have canceled a bunch of series like the Dead by Daylight Pops.
2757320	2759600	They were going to do, which I was super excited about.
2759640	2761440	They canceled them.
2761440	2763200	Yeah, because they're probably producing a lot of these.
2763200	2766840	I can only imagine it would be very hard to estimate
2766840	2769680	and forecast what they would need for a lot of these.
2769680	2776080	And, you know, who knows when stuff either gets moved around, canceled.
2776120	2778760	I mean, I don't know if they're making funko pops based off like,
2778960	2782080	you know, Batgirl or anything like that, those movies. But like.
2783360	2785800	I can only imagine that,
2785800	2789600	you know, there's a finite amount of funko pops that a person can own
2789600	2791600	or have room for, like. Right.
2792120	2794440	Well, look at look at what happened with their stock prices
2794440	2798160	when they announced their forecast for Q4, everything just flushed.
2799720	2802480	Yeah, yeah, these things have been oversaturated for some time,
2802480	2805160	like and I don't hate funko pops.
2805400	2808320	I just recognize that they're they're too much.
2808320	2810480	And they are this comment in chat.
2810880	2814480	Dijarama says, let's be real funko over licensed properties for pops.
2814480	2816440	That shouldn't be. Absolutely.
2816440	2818640	And it's interesting to me.
2818880	2822840	I made the little joke comparison in the sidebar here live on Twitch.
2823000	2826160	They're going to join Atari 2600 properties in the garbage heap
2826160	2828440	because the same thing happened to Atari back in the day.
2828880	2831000	And those documentaries about them
2831000	2834280	digging up copies of ET out of the landfill and stuff are really fascinating.
2834520	2837080	And it's interesting that funko is meeting a similar fate.
2837080	2841560	And it's it's it's the great funko crash is what we're seeing play out now.
2842080	2844880	But how does this affect video games?
2845320	2848000	This is going to be the final nail in the coffin for GameStop.
2849280	2852760	This will absolutely be the final nail in the coffin for GameStop, I think.
2852800	2858440	But it's I mean, it's all they sell nowadays, or at least mostly what they sell.
2858440	2863200	You go in there and there's equal, if not more space per like you look at each.
2863400	2867480	You would think that funko was its own like game console
2867480	2870680	because they have more shelf space than than games.
2870680	2874880	And I mean, it's understandable because they probably make more margin from that.
2874880	2878160	And it comes down to just they're in survival mode over there.
2878200	2882960	And. Yeah, I just I don't see it happening.
2882960	2885480	They couldn't even do it when they're there.
2886200	2890240	Their stock is over evaluated for like how much it's worth.
2890240	2894480	And like. They couldn't even do that with that cast cash influx.
2894480	2899320	It's just they still it's just not a successful business model anymore, I think.
2899960	2901960	Let me tell you an interesting. Oh, go ahead, Jamie.
2903200	2905840	I was just going to say, though, like if they completely crash
2905840	2909560	and go out of business and wait for like another five years
2909560	2912480	and people will be like, oh, fun goes and then you'll find them
2912480	2915040	for like super expensive. Mm hmm.
2915040	2917440	Let me tell an interesting aside story from the cruise.
2917440	2920040	I promise it's relevant. It is absolutely relevant.
2920040	2923640	So as part of the cruise, not only was it a Star Trek cruise,
2923640	2925240	but cruises go to cities, right?
2925240	2928320	So we we docked in three different ports,
2928320	2930920	Cabo San Lucas, Mazatlan and Puerto Vallarta.
2931160	2933600	I've never been to Puerto Vallarta and I was very excited to go.
2933600	2934600	And I had a great time.
2934600	2937040	But one of the things I thought we had more hours in Puerto Vallarta
2937040	2938080	than anywhere else.
2938080	2941600	And the boat docked across the street from a mall.
2942000	2944920	And I was just kind of curious, like, oh, I wonder what the malls in Mexico
2944920	2947520	are like, I wonder what kind of stuff I can find there
2947520	2949880	and, you know, things that maybe I can't find back home and so forth.
2950200	2953040	So we went into the mall in Puerto Vallarta
2953360	2956440	and I saw a store called Game Planet.
2956960	2959560	And I my my brain actually kind of thought of this show
2959560	2962360	because we've had a listener from Mexico for a long time.
2962360	2965680	This will see the show, Mike Deft, Holla, I know you're listening out there.
2965920	2970240	And Mike Deft has always really kind of enlightened us a bit to how gaming
2970240	2973000	purchases kind of work in another country,
2973640	2977680	where maybe some game companies have not always had an official presence.
2977960	2980280	And that was always very fascinating to me.
2980600	2984760	Now, keep in mind, Mexico, big country, just like the U.S., right?
2985800	2988120	Mike Deft lives in like Oregon.
2988120	2991120	And the place in Mexico I was at was like Oklahoma.
2991120	2992560	OK, there were very different parts.
2992560	2994360	Puerto Vallarta is a very different part of the country.
2994680	2998680	However, there was a store I went into in the mall called Game Planet.
2998960	3001600	And when I went into the mall or went to the store,
3001640	3004600	my first reaction was this is this is just a GameStop.
3004760	3007800	This is like but it's way more Nintendo stuff.
3007800	3010160	I noticed because I was like, oh, Nintendo probably has a presence.
3010520	3013800	But then the other the back half of the wall and I'm going to show this.
3013800	3015840	I'm sorry to the podcast listeners.
3015840	3018080	Let me actually switch the shot here so you can see this.
3018440	3020880	Notice how the back wall where I'm standing,
3021120	3024560	it's all fun goes just like any GameStop.
3024800	3026960	I think I took that picture and sent it to our Discord.
3027160	3030760	And then, of course, like game cards for like PlayStation Network
3030760	3031680	and some other things.
3031680	3034360	Otherwise, the signage was all in Spanish and all that.
3034360	3037720	But it was pretty much like any GameStop I've ever been into otherwise.
3038000	3040880	But it was interesting because I kind of thought about Mike Deft
3041120	3042560	when I when I went in there.
3042560	3046000	So as to how Matt says, I was blown away
3046040	3048440	that Sears is alive and thriving while in Mexico.
3048680	3051240	I didn't go to a Sears, but I did go to a different store.
3051240	3052720	And I already forget the name of it.
3052720	3056440	But it was it was neat because it was like it was like a Sears,
3056840	3060240	but had like a travel department in it and a flower store
3060240	3064280	because flowers are huge in the culture in Mexico.
3064800	3067920	The we actually went on a tour in Mazatlan and they were saying that the flower
3067920	3071320	shop was open 24 hours because for every occasion there's
3071360	3072840	and the flowers are beautiful, too.
3072840	3075640	Like it's not just, you know, any old flowers.
3075640	3078120	They were really very beautiful arrangements.
3078120	3079400	Liverpool says Mike Deft.
3079400	3080960	Thank you. That's it. That's it.
3080960	3083120	So anyway, quick aside from the cruise.
3083120	3087960	But my point being funko pops taking over the store.
3088160	3090680	Not a unique problem to the US.
3094680	3097560	Very much the case in Mexico as well, from what I observed,
3097560	3100800	and I'm sure Canada probably over overseas as well.
3100800	3103600	I don't know if there's like, you know, big import fees overseas and stuff,
3103600	3106960	but probably a very similar story as well. So.
3107720	3110800	But I think the bubble is finally burst on these funko pops.
3111160	3114040	And honestly, I hate to say it, maybe it's for the best.
3114320	3116920	Maybe it does cause funko to scale back a bit.
3116920	3120040	And now we it's not like I don't own any funko pop dolls. I do.
3120040	3122640	I'm looking right at some Mass Effect Andromeda dolls that I have.
3123280	3126680	And I have some for Drag Race, you know, some other things as well that we enjoy.
3128240	3131800	I think maybe they'll have to scale back a little bit and maybe more intentionally
3131800	3134320	pick some of the partnerships and some of the like, you know,
3134320	3138240	I didn't like how it's all exclusive at this store and that store
3138240	3140360	and like all of this stuff. So.
3141400	3145080	Anyway, that's that's the only way we can get them to carry those things.
3145080	3150040	And also, I mean, I think a lot of it is people, some some people buy these
3150120	3153200	because we're just the world we live in nowadays thinking that there's
3153200	3156720	a speculative market for it as well and that they're going to be worth something.
3156720	3159120	And I don't know that they are.
3159120	3161640	I don't think most of them are worth anything.
3161800	3166560	It's just do you want to keep it or do you want to like not keep?
3166560	3168840	I don't know. They don't do anything either.
3168840	3170840	So it's like, I don't know.
3170840	3174040	The same thing could be said about collecting action figures
3174040	3178280	or collecting, you know, statues, anime statues.
3178280	3183280	It's all, you know, I I get sick of people who are like,
3183280	3185360	oh, you do funko's meh.
3185360	3187360	I'm like, I don't care. You don't live my life.
3187360	3189440	Yeah. People can like what they like.
3190200	3193840	Yeah. But, you know, it's like for all the people who are like going,
3193840	3195520	hey, look at that, look at that.
3195520	3197520	I mean, there's people who are going to be really disappointed.
3197520	3199760	I wanted those those. Yeah.
3201200	3203040	Dead by daylight ones.
3203040	3204800	And now I don't get them.
3204800	3206800	You know, I'm really disappointed over it.
3207800	3210200	I just I'm just like.
3210200	3214120	People need to let people like their stuff, but we also need to make sure
3214120	3218120	that we're holding, you know, companies accountable for their poor
3218120	3219840	financial decisions. Right.
3219840	3221680	You know, they tried to do everything.
3221680	3225320	They tried to put out something for every fandom. Yeah.
3225320	3230520	And do you know how many fandoms and just different shit people are into?
3231280	3234240	It's a lot. You cannot. You cannot. Absolutely.
3234240	3236880	They way overstepped.
3236880	3238200	Let's see. Yeah. Tiger College
3238200	3240720	has a couple of years from now, someone will do a documentary
3240720	3243880	on digging those funko pops at the landfill and then somebody else
3244080	3245440	just like the cartridges.
3245440	3247520	They will sell them and you can buy them this.
3247520	3249040	I was once in a landfill.
3249040	3252040	You're literally going to be able to put trash on your wall
3252040	3253000	and people will do it.
3253000	3256160	And it's just the interesting way our society works.
3256640	3260440	S2100 Matt asking another question about my trip to Mexico, saying,
3260640	3265200	did you see the roaming random cars driving around like in Forza Horizon five?
3265720	3271480	No, but I did notice the absolute lack of traffic laws period.
3272560	3275600	Or like very, very few traffic lights.
3275600	3279400	I will say when we were in Mazatlán, our tour guide, she knew
3279440	3283760	she would jump out into the street and hold her arms up to stop the traffic.
3284000	3285400	So all of us, you know,
3285400	3288480	stupid Americans and Canadians could walk by and cross the street
3288480	3291480	because, you know, people don't stop unless you,
3291480	3294280	you know, make it very clear to do those sorts of things.
3294280	3296880	This is this wasn't like some obscure part of town.
3296920	3299720	This is like downtown Mazatlán, the old town district.
3299720	3303000	So I was that I definitely noticed that
3303040	3306320	the absolute lack of any traffic laws whatsoever.
3306960	3308440	But you know what?
3309120	3311040	I got from point A to point B.
3311040	3314760	We got from our boat down to Zona Romantica, which was like a three
3315680	3317240	three mile journey.
3317240	3320280	It was too long to walk, but not a very long bus.
3320800	3325440	I actually took thanks to JD, who is huge on public transit, our buddy JD.
3326960	3329640	I I rode a Mexican bus.
3329640	3332880	I paid 10 pesos to ride the Mexican, but actually JD paid for me
3332880	3338080	10 pesos to ride the Mexican bus from the port down to Zona Romantica.
3338320	3339800	And it was great.
3339800	3342480	But anyway, I'll talk more about that on Thursday.
3342480	3346680	All right. Let's get into this next story.
3346720	3350840	Oh, you know, when you saw this in the news, you knew I was going to bring this up.
3350840	3353880	You knew I was going to bring up this story.
3354360	3357280	Am I here to gloat tonight?
3357280	3359200	A little. Maybe. OK.
3359200	3361080	Yes, but yes, but
3361960	3365240	I actually don't think there's a lot here to gloat about.
3365720	3367480	So what am I talking about?
3367480	3372520	Anybody that listened to our predictions episode in early January probably heard.
3372520	3375040	And I wish I had time to go find the clip and dig it up.
3375040	3375960	But you know what?
3375960	3378440	The podcast is out there. You can go listen to it for yourself.
3378440	3379480	It's on the record.
3379480	3382200	One of the predictions I made, I think it was my number three prediction.
3382200	3386120	I said the current CEO of Square Enix,
3386120	3390200	Yosuke Matsuda was Square Enix was going to get sacked.
3390440	3395000	And I said he was going to do it because the fact that he tied himself to NFTs,
3395320	3400200	the fact that he failed to redirect the PR conversation
3400200	3404160	around the Final Fantasy 16 diversity issue and people raise it,
3404160	3407120	you know, they're very, you know, what was a poor response to all of that
3407400	3410520	and not, you know, doing better on clarifying
3410520	3412880	and showing how they're going to do better in that whole situation.
3413120	3418040	And then, of course, you know, add into that things like the fact that Babylon's fall
3418080	3419720	absolutely flopped.
3419720	3422320	There is no nice way to put it.
3422320	3426240	I don't think four spoken is unfortunately selling to expectations,
3426480	3429200	especially when this same guy has gone on the record
3429200	3432720	saying things like Tomb Raider did not sell the expectations.
3432720	3434840	Well, if Tomb Raider didn't sell the expectations,
3434840	3437760	I'm positive for spoken and sell the expectations either.
3438080	3441200	So what happened? Where does this all end up? Yep.
3441840	3446920	You know, Suki Matsuda was officially sacked by Square Enix this week.
3447160	3449720	The company has announced this shake up on Friday,
3449920	3453560	saying it is needed to chase more technological innovation.
3453800	3457800	Now, here's where I'm willing to admit this is not the part of the news
3457800	3462080	I saw coming, because unfortunately, although, yes, I thank you,
3462080	3466280	Jaskren, who says I saw the news and I thought that Rob might be a prophet.
3466560	3470480	OK, so maybe I did call this, but the reasoning here,
3470960	3474280	not what I thought I would see, and that's not a good thing.
3474680	3481360	So the replacement for Matsuda is a gentleman named Takashi Kiryu,
3481680	3484360	who is a new CEO. He's only been at Square for a few years.
3484640	3489080	But prior to that, he worked for the Dentsu Innovation Initiative.
3489400	3493880	This is a business group that explores opportunities in things like the metaverse.
3496040	3499080	Here's the official on the record reason that Square Enix gave
3499080	3501200	for why this transition is happening.
3501520	3504960	Keep in mind, Matsuda was there for 10 years.
3505160	3508560	That is that is a long tenureship.
3509880	3512720	Under the rapid change of business environments surrounding
3512720	3514160	the entertainment industry,
3514160	3517560	the proposed change is intended to reshape the management team
3517720	3521920	with the goal of adopting ever evolving technological innovations
3522120	3525320	and maximizing on the creativity of the company's group
3525320	3529640	in order to deliver even greater entertainment to customers around the world.
3530640	3533160	Ever evolving technological innovations.
3534120	3536720	That worries me because they're not talking about PS6.
3537320	3538760	They're not talking about VR.
3540040	3546120	They're talking about NFTs and what I think the new buzzword in everybody's ear.
3546120	3549000	This is where I really think it's going, AI.
3551080	3553120	How that gets worked into video games,
3553120	3554920	I'm not sure what that looks like yet.
3554920	3556440	AI is already in video games, though.
3557360	3559640	Oh, very good point.
3559640	3560720	Yes, AI. You're right.
3560720	3564840	AI, the concept of AI has been in video games since video games existed, really.
3564840	3569360	Machine learning in and of itself is common now.
3569360	3569640	Yeah.
3569640	3571400	Especially in a lot of technology.
3571880	3573760	So I...
3574360	3575080	Totally fair.
3575080	3579360	I chose my words poorly because what I mean to say is AI in regards
3579360	3584840	to some of this newer trend about automated art, automated writing,
3585080	3590000	and could there be a game that ends up being a forever game
3590400	3594480	that is able to be forever because AI generates a chunk of it?
3594840	3597240	I have a feeling this is what Square Enix wants to get on.
3597520	3598880	They want to make an open world game
3598880	3602240	that is in part generated by AI, for better or for worse.
3602880	3604440	Sounds interesting.
3604440	3605440	It could be interesting.
3605440	3608080	I don't know. I have to see it.
3608680	3610960	I can see potential in that kind of idea.
3610960	3613640	Like, imagine that you start off with like a base world
3614120	3619480	and as the people, quote, exist in it and play through it like like an MMO,
3619800	3623160	the landscape changes, like say that you buy
3623520	3626320	a plot of land and you do construction on it.
3626880	3632000	That plot of lands, you know, the the ground moves to other places.
3632240	3633880	You know, it damages a river.
3633880	3638080	So, you know, that having something like that would actually be really awesome.
3638600	3641440	I worry that's not where Square is going with it.
3641440	3642960	We'll see. Time will tell.
3642960	3645200	And I'm willing to give this guy a chance.
3645400	3649080	And I'm not going to judge this guy completely on his background,
3649080	3651800	because what he did in the past is not what he's going to do now.
3651800	3656520	So I'm willing to give this guy a fresh slate and see where does he take this now?
3656800	3659280	I'm not encouraged by what I'm hearing, but let's see.
3659680	3660960	Because you're right, DarkSocker.
3660960	3662760	You don't run Square Enix. Neither do I.
3662920	3664560	Here's where I see the problem.
3664560	3669800	OK, the problem, and I think this is why Matsuda ultimately paid the price.
3670120	3672800	The problem was these very high profile,
3672800	3676760	big bunch budget launches that are flopping.
3677360	3679000	And there's no nice way to say it.
3679000	3681960	That's that's not a testament to the quality of the game.
3681960	3685680	Well, I think it is in Babylon's fall case, but I haven't played Forspoken.
3685920	3690600	I'm not I'm not able to speak to why that game flopped, but I have a hunch
3690600	3692720	it's because the demo they put out wasn't great.
3693080	3696080	And when you're asking people to invest 70 dollars in a game,
3696240	3699720	you need to have a rock solid demo or no demo at all, quite frankly.
3700800	3704080	I thought that game looked awesome and everything that I had seen,
3704080	3707160	I just didn't buy it because I have no way to play it right now. Right.
3707520	3710800	And I want to I want to also show something else, because I believe
3710800	3715560	where Square Enix needs to be going is some of these more middle of the road.
3715560	3719280	I do think Square Enix needs to do some investment in the middle of the road
3719480	3724080	and some lower budget titles that can actually bring forth
3724080	3727400	a little more than maybe a big budget AI or NFT project.
3727920	3731280	Here's some of the proof I want to kind of to make my case, you know,
3731280	3733720	and maybe you're going to read into this differently than I do.
3733880	3736360	But here's me attempting to show some receipts. OK.
3736520	3738320	Now, I'm not able to find the U.S.
3738320	3741000	sales numbers yet for how some games are performing.
3741000	3746280	However, Forspoken in Japan was last in the top 30
3746440	3750480	the week of I believe this was February 6th through February 12th.
3750960	3753480	And you can see when it was last in the top 30,
3754000	3759880	it moved 1932 units for a total of 35,000 units.
3760160	3762320	Now, granted, this is retail units.
3762320	3764120	This doesn't count what's digital.
3764120	3767080	So I'm not saying this game only moved 35,000 copies.
3767360	3771280	But, you know, just to kind of set the benchmark there, this high dollar
3771280	3777200	big budget game looks like it's going to cap out maybe at 40,000 copies in Japan,
3777440	3782200	unless maybe there's some bang up DLC that happens later or something like that
3782440	3786240	that, you know, causes this game to sell more. In contrast,
3787440	3793200	the Square Enix game that I am unable to shut up about, Theatrhythm, shows up.
3793200	3795280	Now, we don't have complete sales data for Theatrhythm,
3795400	3798040	but it shows up on the next week's sales list. Right.
3798320	3801920	And so we have two entries for Theatrhythm because it's on two platforms.
3802240	3806160	The Switch copy has moved 11,000 units in, excuse me,
3806160	3808560	11.5 thousand units in its first week.
3808920	3812400	And the PlayStation 4 versions down here at number 16,
3812600	3816760	which moved 3.6 thousand units in its first week.
3817000	3820520	You add that together, that's about 15,000
3820920	3823920	in the first week that this game has moved.
3824240	3827760	Now, granted, that's not that's not even half of 40,000,
3828040	3831240	but we're not quite sure yet what the subsequent weeks are going to look like.
3831240	3835200	And even if this game only capped out at maybe 30,000 units,
3835440	3839720	and I would also argue Theatrhythm is certainly going to sell even more
3839920	3842760	digitally because of things like the Digital Deluxe Edition
3842760	3844760	and some of those things that they've been offering digitally.
3845040	3848640	I would bet dimes to dollars, even if I don't have the receipts to prove it.
3848840	3851520	Theatrhythm is going to sell more digitally
3851920	3855840	than it's going to in a physical copy than a game like Forespoken.
3856640	3862000	My point being, even if Theatrhythm and Forespoken sell the same amount,
3863000	3866880	which my receipts only maybe show that that's the way things are going to go right now.
3867320	3871640	One of those games took a hell of a lot more money to make than the other.
3872400	3876280	Now, I know some of you are going to poke holes in my theory left and right.
3876480	3878200	Rob, you're only considering Japan.
3878400	3879760	Rob, it's only physical.
3879760	3882480	And, you know, there's these I understand I'm willing to accept
3882480	3884720	that this is not a perfect science what I'm showing you.
3885240	3889560	What I'm trying to point out is that a game like Theatrhythm
3890000	3894000	that cost a fraction to make of something like Forespoken,
3894400	3897440	this is where Square Enix needs to head a lot more of.
3897720	3901080	They need to maybe play it safe for a little bit
3901320	3904600	and maybe give us that Chrono Trigger remaster
3904600	3906680	that Jason was referencing in the intro tonight
3906920	3910520	and some of these other things that can move a fair amount of units
3910800	3914920	to then build up the coffers to try again on one of these AAA titles
3914920	3918560	that maybe, you know, a big name can get behind or something like that.
3918560	3923600	You know, if Final Fantasy 16 does very well, it's too early to say.
3923600	3927000	And I'm not going to venture a guess on how well Final Fantasy 16 is going to sell.
3927360	3933240	But if Final Fantasy 16 does well, let's say it does better than 15 or 13,
3933640	3935640	which it might, it might.
3937120	3940000	Despite however you feel about the controversies on this whole thing,
3940240	3942280	I think you could recognize there's a real possibility
3942280	3947160	16 could sell better than 15 or 13 did, or 12, quite honestly.
3947320	3949320	Hell, we'd have to go all the way back to 10.
3949320	3952720	I think 16 is going to sell better than any game since 10. I do.
3953600	3958480	If that, well, minus the MMOs, don't include 14, because that's not fair.
3958680	3963240	Because the monthly fee, that's filling Square's bank account right now
3963240	3965120	is 14, to some extent 11.
3965120	3966480	So we're not going to count those.
3968160	3971520	But as far as 16 goes, if 16 does well,
3971920	3979920	I would bet Naoki Yoshida, Yoshi-P, gets licensed to make whatever game he wants.
3980560	3983480	And honestly, he should.
3984840	3989680	Hopefully he will listen to some of the feedback on the types of characters he should be putting in those games.
3990040	3992160	But I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna go too far down.
3992160	3995240	I mean, 14 has done a pretty good job.
3995280	4000960	So there's, you know, and I got into this when we talked about the controversy to begin with
4001000	4004160	is that I think there's a lot more play than just Yoshida.
4004160	4009320	I think it's the voices that have educated Yoshida in the past need to be corrected.
4009760	4010960	But I'm gonna, I'm gonna digress.
4011080	4015080	I think Yoshida is going to get creative license to do whatever he wants next.
4015080	4018960	And that will be the new AAA offering that comes out of Square Enix.
4019240	4020480	So we'll, we'll see.
4022760	4026360	Jaskren in chat says, this is a really good analysis.
4026400	4030200	There is more money to be made with smaller budget games if those games are hits.
4030520	4034040	It is very similar to the movie industry.
4034960	4039280	The movie industry wants movies like The Blair Witch Project.
4039680	4041320	There's something about Mary.
4042400	4045320	Hell, everything everywhere all at once would fall into this category.
4045480	4047400	What do all of these movies have in common?
4048360	4050760	Small or paranormal activity.
4050760	4051520	Another great example.
4051680	4056240	Small, very small, in some case, budget movies that make a lot of money.
4057000	4058520	They want those type of movies.
4058520	4059080	Snakes on the plane.
4059240	4061000	Yep, snakes on the plane, great example.
4061280	4066120	Honestly, Megan and Cocaine Bear, you want to go, at least I'm assuming Cocaine Bear made money.
4066800	4068280	Sure sounded like it was going to.
4069160	4078080	The studios want those movies, as opposed to Oh, God, what was that absolute Disney flop that came out, like, last year?
4078320	4080840	It was a couple of years ago, maybe it was before the pandemic even.
4081000	4086520	And it just flopped so hard in theaters that like, yeah, it was it was, it was really ugly.
4086960	4088480	The movie industry wants those things.
4088520	4090280	John Carter was that maybe?
4090560	4093240	No, I feel like it was a superhero movie of some sort.
4093760	4095200	Maybe based on mythology.
4095280	4096000	I don't remember.
4096000	4096760	I'm sorry, y'all.
4096840	4100200	Oh, you're thinking of Percy Jackson?
4101560	4103360	No, but that is a good example.
4104520	4105800	No, no, I know what you're thinking of.
4105800	4110360	You're thinking of Oh, God, it costs him a lot of money.
4111360	4112240	My kids have the books.
4112280	4113640	Yes, it was books.
4113640	4119400	Oh, no, it's not John Carter.
4119400	4120360	It's not John Carter.
4120400	4122400	It's more recent that John Carter's like years ago.
4122720	4126520	I was like, I was back when I was in the No, not Buzz Lightyear.
4126560	4127120	I'll look it up.
4127120	4127560	Hold on.
4127560	4128360	I don't remember.
4128360	4129120	It's called now.
4129160	4131560	It's John Carter.
4131600	4133480	They're they're all saying it was John Carter of Mars.
4133520	4134720	So maybe maybe it wasn't.
4134880	4136160	That was a flop, too.
4136160	4139760	But there was another word because I don't even know what it is.
4140120	4143120	But I thought I thought it was like a mythological story or something.
4143440	4145280	No, it's it's not John Carter.
4145280	4148760	I know for a fact it's not it's my kids have the books.
4148800	4149560	It's not.
4150200	4152320	It came out like during the pandemic.
4153400	4156880	I just don't remember it was called it was Artemis Fowl.
4156920	4157720	That's what it was.
4157760	4160640	Oh, that Artemis Fowl was awful.
4160680	4161920	It was foul.
4162240	4162720	Yeah.
4163120	4166360	Anyway, I all these.
4166400	4169680	OK, I mean, yes, we're all guessing get in Rob's brain.
4169680	4171080	What's the movie he's thinking of?
4171160	4174640	Everything you guys are shouting in chat is actually making my point.
4174640	4176680	So thank you for the new mutants.
4176680	4178080	I don't think that was that good either.
4178080	4180640	And that was like the X-Men.
4180640	4183160	And I don't know how well Mulan did the live action one,
4183160	4185160	but I don't think as good as Lion King.
4185160	4190000	But I think Square Enix would be very smart to stick to the Octopath Travelers,
4190000	4193880	the Bravely defaults, the hell, the Dungeon Explorer.
4193880	4197920	Even if I think that game has some big flaws with it, that game doesn't
4198160	4203960	doesn't get a CEO fired when it doesn't do well, as opposed to a Babylon's fall.
4204160	4208640	I think Square Enix needs to take some safer risks so they can find out what
4208640	4211680	their audience really wants so they can make the big one.
4211880	4216800	I worry when they talk like this, tomorrow's technologies, whether it's NFT,
4216800	4221200	whether it's AI or whatever, they're going to try to tell us the next big thing
4221200	4225840	and not listen to what the audience is telling you with their wallets.
4226280	4226880	And guess what?
4226920	4229480	I would bet, I would bet money.
4230120	4233400	They did not expect Theatrhythm to even move
4233400	4235840	what the number of units that I just talked about.
4237440	4239880	Nostalgia is a wild thing.
4240200	4243560	And I get I'm not saying I want Square Enix to only
4244560	4247960	do the nostalgia jerk for years and years.
4247960	4252480	I do want Square Enix to be able to create things like Fourspoken
4252800	4255120	and create new types of things.
4255280	4257160	They just need to be able to do it
4258520	4259520	on a smaller budget
4260760	4261600	for a little while.
4263040	4266120	And honestly, offloading some of the companies
4266120	4269120	that they did may actually help them to that.
4269320	4273560	Prince Caspian, that was no that because that was a Narnia movie.
4273560	4275800	No, no, no. Anyway, forget it.
4276560	4277960	That was like super old too.
4277960	4279840	I'm I'm done trying to figure it out.
4279840	4281880	Maybe I'll Google it while Loki does the next story.
4281880	4282920	It was Artemis Fowl.
4282960	4284880	I can tell you right now because it was awful.
4284880	4287920	And I don't even remember if that came out in theaters.
4287920	4291760	But like, yeah, they've had a lot of flops with as far as big budget.
4291760	4293480	Yeah. John Carpenter and Mars.
4293480	4296960	They were expecting it to be like a big new trilogy like Star Wars size.
4296960	4298480	And it probably was. I don't know.
4298480	4300560	Anyway, that was like years ago.
4300560	4302560	I'm officially done thinking about it. All right.
4304640	4305240	What was it going to say?
4305240	4307200	Oh, Fifth Dream has a great comment here.
4307200	4311360	And those games have engines to build, so they'll be cheaper to produce.
4311600	4314440	Also, that one card game where they put out like for a year,
4314440	4317840	just insert a new story and swap assets, new 40 dollar game.
4318760	4320920	Are you talking about like Kingdom Hearts, Chains of Memories
4320920	4321920	and those types of car games?
4321920	4324480	But when you talk about the engine, you're absolutely right.
4324680	4330920	Look at Octopath, Octopath 2, Live Alive, you know, and where
4330920	4335120	I honestly think the Chrono Trigger remake ought to go is in that engine.
4335120	4336800	And if you want to talk about remakes,
4336800	4339400	you know, Secret of Mana was in a similar engine,
4339400	4340920	although that wouldn't do us well.
4340920	4344000	But, you know, we have Final Fantasy six remake in that engine.
4344560	4346920	Well, now we have the pixel remasters and so forth.
4346920	4349120	So I want it this way.
4350160	4355280	Yeah. So anyway, my my point is Square Enix should really listen
4355280	4359440	to what the fans want and need a CEO that comes in there to really listen to this
4359920	4363320	and maybe lay off some of the experimentation for a little bit
4363640	4366840	while they find their footing again to help them find their next game.
4366840	4368600	That's what I would do if I was CEO.
4369640	4372880	But I'm not. But also I call this.
4373000	4375320	All right. All right.
4375640	4378000	My ego is swelling. All right.
4378000	4379360	Anyway, let's move on.
4379360	4380920	On that note, Dark Soccer.
4380920	4384760	Well, if you ruled the world, we'd be getting this a lot sooner.
4385880	4388040	Right? Mm hmm.
4388040	4390480	We would have already been done had it.
4392000	4396920	So there is a Dead by Daylight movie coming out.
4397920	4401080	I'm I'm both afraid and excited.
4402040	4406440	So it's coming out from Blumhouse and Atomic Monster
4406440	4409200	and of course, Behavior, because Behavior owns Dead by Daylight.
4410320	4415840	But they are doing a feature film adaptation of Dead by Daylight.
4418200	4422200	And they're they sound pretty excited about it.
4423200	4429640	There is the for the Atomic Monster founder and CEO, James Wan said,
4430080	4431320	I'm going to read the quote.
4431320	4434080	In Dead by Daylight, the Behavior team has created a love letter
4434080	4437200	to the world of horror, building an incredible environment,
4437200	4439640	teeming with atmosphere and terrifying villains,
4439640	4442000	perfect for a scary cinematic adaptation.
4442400	4444360	We're big fans of the game at Atomic Monster,
4444360	4446160	and we're thrilled to be teaming up with Blumhouse
4446160	4449320	to bring this frightening, visceral world to the big screen.
4449720	4452720	So they're looking for a director and screenwriter.
4454160	4458080	They want to bring on somebody that appreciates
4458080	4460240	and loves the game like the fans do.
4461480	4464920	You know, lots of, I guess, watching of the lore.
4466600	4472120	And also just FYI, one directed The Conjuring and Insidious
4472120	4475440	and Blum produced Get Out and The Purge.
4476000	4480240	So, I mean, there's some really good like credentials behind it.
4480240	4481280	They did Megan too.
4481280	4484520	So Blumhouse is a huge name in the horror world right now.
4484520	4487680	So this is this is a good place for this to be at the end of the day.
4488880	4493280	I mean, and I have a feeling that they may not be able to get
4493280	4497280	like the licensed killers, you know, not without lots of money.
4498000	4502960	But I have seen see it like with some of like.
4502960	4506080	The original four survivors have to be there.
4506080	4506560	Yeah.
4507200	4512480	And I'm thinking that maybe like, you know, the original three
4512480	4519440	and Nurse and you know, like Hag, you know, like the the in game ones.
4519440	4520760	I mean, those would be a definite.
4520760	4522880	I mean, I would love.
4522880	4525320	The Hag would be scary because she's a cannibal.
4526320	4529360	But you know, they're going to set up sequels in their minds,
4529360	4531280	so they're they're going to they're going to with everything
4531280	4532320	I think you're right on that.
4532320	4536240	It'll be the originals, maybe Phong Minh and the Doctor,
4536240	4538880	just because of her popularity in particular.
4539440	4541040	And I think you're right that maybe the nurse.
4541040	4544240	But it would be those early DLC characters only.
4544240	4548560	And like they're going to save later releases for sequels.
4548560	4549200	Absolutely.
4549200	4552800	Like you're not going to see more popular later killers like bleep
4552800	4553680	or anything like that.
4553680	4555360	They won't be in the movie.
4555360	4559040	Well, and by then, though, I mean, it could very well be possible
4559120	4562240	it could very well be possible that they'd have, you know,
4562240	4566640	enough interest and revenue from it to invest in the licensed characters.
4568560	4569440	There's a possibility.
4569440	4572240	I'm just throwing it out there, although honestly,
4572240	4575360	I would love to see the Dredge.
4577360	4580000	I think I also don't know if we should write off
4580000	4581520	the licensed killers completely.
4581520	4583920	I think, you know, if they could get the rights,
4583920	4586400	I think especially a cameo at the end.
4586400	4588800	Imagine right before the credits or at the end of the movie
4589360	4592160	I don't know why, but I feel like the most likely one to show up,
4592160	4596400	because what else is he doing these days besides getting his own video game, Bubba?
4596400	4598560	I think if Leatherface showed up at the end of the movie,
4600080	4603600	I only say this because I feel like he's got the best chance
4603600	4606560	versus like a Freddy or, you know, some of the other license.
4606560	4608240	Freddy would have a better chance.
4608240	4609280	You really do.
4609280	4612000	Nothing is happening with the Nightmare on Elm Street license.
4612960	4614240	You know, the other reason?
4614240	4616400	Well, here's the other reason why I say Bubba,
4616400	4619600	because they could put, and it's to be fair, Michael Myers,
4619600	4620720	they could do this, too.
4620720	4622320	They could put anybody under the mask.
4623200	4625840	With Freddy, all everybody's going to say is,
4625840	4626960	why isn't it Robert Englund?
4627760	4629040	That's going to be the problem.
4629680	4631280	A mask killer, they could put anyone under the mask.
4631280	4632640	I just don't see them going that way at all.
4632640	4635760	I see them keeping Hillbilly and not putting in Bubba.
4636400	4639120	You know, I see, I mean, and who knows,
4639120	4642160	there might even just be an original killer
4642160	4644560	that like you do something with your ticket
4644560	4645840	and you get them in the game.
4645840	4646880	I bet they're going to do DLC.
4646880	4650160	Oh, it debuts in the movie and then is dealing.
4650160	4651120	Oh, yeah.
4651120	4651680	Oh, yeah.
4652240	4653680	Anyway, yeah.
4653680	4655600	Tigerfly says, doesn't Dead by Daylight
4655600	4656880	mostly have original characters?
4656880	4658640	The license stuff can't be a part of the movie.
4658640	4662240	Yes, but that's not, I mean, it's money in her grievance.
4662240	4662880	That's a pretty good split still.
4662880	4664000	Never say never.
4664000	4664800	Yeah, it's a good split.
4665840	4670640	But at any rate, you know, I mean, we're talking about,
4670640	4672640	you know, not just like you said, Megan,
4672640	4675360	they did, you know, Malignant, Paranormal Activity,
4675440	4676480	Blackphone, you know.
4677760	4678400	There's a lot.
4678400	4680160	It's really a lot.
4680160	4684080	And also, Blumhouse announced the launch of Blumhouse Games
4684880	4687280	that will do indie budget video games.
4688800	4690640	They'll produce and publish for under 10 mil.
4692560	4696720	So I wonder if we might start seeing collaborations as well
4696720	4699760	or like, you know, other DVD spinoffs like Hooked on You,
4700400	4702160	but on like the indie field.
4702480	4702980	Hmm.
4703520	4705520	So I mean, there's like lots of,
4707200	4710400	lots of, you know, potential for this.
4710400	4714800	I really think that they've got the right people on this.
4715520	4717520	And I mean, it's still early days, you know,
4717520	4719760	they don't have a director or a screenwriter.
4720480	4723600	So I mean, I would reckon we would see this
4723600	4725600	maybe in two to three years.
4727280	4729440	And who knows where DVD will be by then,
4729440	4732320	although knowing behavior, it will still, you know,
4732320	4735040	be a little bit broken, but very interesting.
4735040	4737600	And people will still be complaining about MMR.
4737600	4740160	That's also a very good point.
4740160	4742880	I mean, I don't want to speak this harshly,
4742880	4745120	but this is the only sentence that comes to mind is,
4745120	4747680	will DVD still be as relevant in the gaming world
4747680	4750640	by the time this movie hits or has the time to strike
4750640	4753200	when the iron is hot, so to speak, already passed?
4753200	4755120	People asked that question three years ago
4755120	4756000	when I started playing.
4756640	4758480	Okay, fair answer.
4759920	4762400	But actually, SSJ 100 Matt brings up a good point.
4762400	4764320	Michael Myers makes the most sense, really.
4764320	4766240	Blumhouse and Danny McBride have been doing
4766240	4767920	those recent Halloween movies.
4767920	4769200	Oh, I did.
4769200	4770000	Oh, that's right.
4770000	4772240	It is Blumhouse that did the reboot trilogy.
4772240	4772880	Okay.
4772880	4774080	No, you're right.
4774080	4774960	I changed my answer.
4775840	4776640	Yeah, and they're doing,
4777200	4779600	he also says they're doing a new Exorcist movie.
4779600	4784000	I doubt very seriously that we'll have, you know,
4784000	4785280	a pea soup vomiting.
4786640	4787920	We already have.
4787920	4788960	Oh my God.
4788960	4790400	It just occurred to me, Rob.
4792240	4795840	If the plague might've been an attempt
4795840	4800400	to license the Exorcist and it didn't work.
4801200	4802080	Maybe, I don't know.
4802080	4803040	I don't know.
4803040	4806640	Although they're saying though that the new killer,
4806640	4811520	the Skull Merchant is a failed attempt to get Predator.
4811520	4813280	Yeah, I've heard that too.
4813360	4813920	Yep.
4813920	4814420	Yeah.
4814960	4815680	Interesting.
4815680	4819280	But you know, you know, though the fandom,
4819280	4821520	the loyal fans stay loyal, right?
4821520	4822080	Yep.
4822080	4824400	And even people who walk away from the game,
4825600	4827600	they, a lot of people come back.
4828320	4829120	I hope if they do-
4829120	4830080	There'll be something that comes out
4830080	4830880	that'll bring them back.
4831600	4833200	It's interesting because with this movie,
4833200	4835600	I hope that it's very similar advice
4835600	4837040	to what I just said to Square Enix.
4837600	4839920	I hope they don't spend too much money on it.
4840560	4843440	I hope they get, you know, some good up and coming,
4843440	4846080	but horror movies usually are not expensive.
4846080	4846720	They are usually on the cheap to me.
4846720	4848960	I want to know what Tiger Claw is talking about DVDs.
4848960	4851600	Cause we said DBD, Dead by Daylight.
4854160	4854720	All right.
4854720	4855200	Anyway.
4855200	4857200	I don't know if that's serious or a joke.
4857200	4857700	All right.
4858240	4858880	Let's move on.
4859680	4860800	Let's get to our next story,
4860800	4863680	which is not as funny, unfortunately.
4863680	4864180	Loki.
4864960	4866800	No, unfortunately not.
4866800	4871600	So EA has laid off 200 Apex Legends testers
4871600	4875200	and they did it over a remote meeting call.
4875200	4877840	So an unscheduled mandatory Zoom meeting.
4879840	4883120	And so they had, actually with their
4883920	4887120	contracting agency, Magnet Global,
4887840	4893920	and basically that they were let go as part of that.
4893920	4896480	The test, these, you know, basically EAs come out
4896480	4900000	and they haven't made a comment yet regarding the layouts,
4900000	4902880	but testing games is an integral part of delivering
4902880	4904560	the best experiences to our players.
4904560	4906000	They said that in PR speak.
4909120	4912640	But yeah, it's basically that they are testing team
4912640	4914880	and ending testing execution.
4914880	4918720	That's been concentrated in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
4918720	4920400	It says impacted services provided
4920400	4922400	by our third party providers.
4922400	4925440	Our global team, inclusive of remote play testers
4925440	4927040	across the United States,
4927040	4929760	enable us to increase hours per week and blah, blah, blah.
4931040	4934160	So maybe they're just, you know, reducing staff
4934160	4935520	for different testing.
4935520	4937680	I don't know, but I don't know.
4937680	4939600	It's always bad news, especially when you do it,
4939600	4941760	like over like a remote meeting like that.
4941760	4943440	I guess I understand if they're all remote,
4943440	4945600	let me have them in the office to do it in person,
4945600	4948400	but something a little bit more personable probably
4948400	4950640	instead of just, okay, you're all let go.
4951360	4954800	Like at least an email or something, a letter.
4955680	4956180	Yeah.
4957760	4958480	I don't know.
4958480	4960480	Like the one time I was laid off,
4960480	4963120	they had everybody together and made the announcement,
4963120	4964160	although I wasn't there for it
4964160	4965200	because I was on medical leave.
4967520	4971680	But I think that doing it by Zoom would be the equivalent
4971680	4973760	of calling an in-house company meeting.
4974480	4976160	I don't see any problem with it.
4977280	4980320	For remote where it still sucks that it's 200 people,
4980640	4981200	being let go.
4981920	4983920	But I mean that method because quite like,
4983920	4985680	and this is actually what happened with mine,
4986880	4990080	is that when they sold the company
4990080	4992880	and we were all outsourced, they gathered everyone,
4992880	4996800	said it in person and letters came out like the following week.
4997840	5001360	And maybe that's where it feels a little oof
5001360	5004160	is because it was Zoom calls with 200 people
5004160	5006080	and even if it's 200 people in person,
5006080	5008560	maybe it doesn't feel as personable.
5008560	5010880	Whereas maybe even if they've done something as simple as
5010880	5014080	do it in a Zoom call with 10 people at a time.
5014080	5016400	Yes, it's a lot more work to do it that way,
5016400	5018640	but it might feel a lot more personable
5018640	5019360	and you're able to be,
5019360	5022000	I mean, ideally you do it one at a time,
5022000	5024480	but I understand there has to be a compromise here.
5025200	5027760	Where maybe do it team by team or something
5027760	5029440	where you can answer some of the questions,
5029440	5030880	concerns a little more directly
5030880	5032880	and at least have that human side of it,
5032880	5035520	which is impossible to get in a group of 200
5035520	5037280	where people aren't really going to be able to ask questions,
5037280	5038400	but in chat.
5038480	5043680	So maybe that's where it feels a little bleh.
5044720	5048000	One actually good thing with a chat format like that
5048000	5050000	is that it also helps you field questions.
5051600	5053200	Because a bunch of people are going to be asking
5053200	5054000	the same question,
5055840	5057760	so you can actually field questions
5058320	5061280	and lump in the similar questions together.
5061440	5061940	Mm-hmm.
5062480	5065360	You know, and you could also just,
5066080	5070080	it helps with efficiency and delivering the information
5070080	5071920	because you can't really do that when,
5072560	5074800	you know, you have a big meeting,
5074800	5076240	because I mean, in my experience,
5076240	5077840	like meetings like that,
5077840	5079120	like big business meetings,
5079120	5081600	don't really open the floor to questions.
5082640	5084800	They just say, get in touch with HR.
5085520	5086020	Yeah.
5086560	5090160	So I could see this as actually being a good opportunity
5090160	5092160	to field questions about it as well.
5092160	5092660	Yeah.
5094320	5095440	I don't think it's as negative
5095440	5096640	as people are making it out to be.
5097440	5097840	Yeah.
5097840	5098880	Well, on the flip side-
5098880	5100000	Other than losing a job.
5100960	5102240	We have Activision,
5102240	5104800	who is now coming under fire
5104800	5107200	by the Communications Workers of America,
5107200	5110240	who filed charges against the publisher
5110240	5114240	in regards to firing two QA testers
5115280	5118560	over apparently the use of strong language.
5118560	5121200	So two QA testers have expressed their outrage
5121200	5125040	using strong language in response to management
5125040	5127760	set up disciplinary meetings
5127760	5129680	where both workers were fired.
5130240	5133120	And apparently the CWA is saying
5133120	5135120	that the use of outbursts and strong language
5135120	5138480	in the context of concerted activity by employees
5138480	5141920	was protected by the National Labor Relations Board
5143520	5146720	even up until 2020 where it was tested.
5147280	5150000	And then they said that Activision says,
5150000	5151760	we don't allow employees to use profane
5151760	5153680	or abusive language against each other.
5155520	5156240	Really?
5156240	5156960	Really, you don't?
5157840	5158340	Right.
5158340	5159840	We should listen to Michael first.
5159840	5162480	We're disappointed that the CWA advocates
5162480	5164160	this type of behavior.
5164720	5166000	It sounds like an excuse.
5166000	5167600	Were they trying to unionize?
5167600	5169120	I mean, I could see something like that.
5169520	5178880	So yeah, more fire, it's more of the same, it seems like.
5178880	5186880	More of Activision finding creative ways to fire people,
5188080	5190400	especially those protesting their practices.
5193520	5196880	Well, now that's a good question.
5197520	5200480	Well, now that's just shady,
5200480	5202800	but unfortunately completely unsurprising
5202800	5204640	coming from Activision, to be quite honest.
5204640	5208240	So hopefully the acquisition of their company
5208240	5209600	can't happen soon enough.
5209600	5210640	Clean house, you know?
5210640	5211140	Yeah.
5211680	5212400	At the top.
5212400	5214240	At the top is where the layoffs need to happen.
5215440	5217200	All right, moving on.
5217200	5219360	Let's talk about Final Fantasy XVI.
5219360	5220640	I brought it up later in the show,
5220640	5221920	but it was actually in the news,
5221920	5223600	or excuse me, earlier in the show I brought it up.
5223600	5225280	But it's been in the news quite a bit this week
5225280	5227600	because some press previews happened this week
5227600	5231040	where I think folks got to play a several hour demo of it,
5231040	5232720	probably in a controlled environment,
5232720	5234960	and kind of got to experience a lot of the battle,
5234960	5236000	kind of got to play with that.
5236960	5238000	Because I've been out,
5238000	5240160	I have not caught up on the videos of it.
5240160	5242240	I've just kind of watched a little bit.
5242240	5244800	So I used to watch Skill Up.
5244800	5247840	Maybe I should look some up and get some live thoughts here.
5249840	5251600	So they flew them out to Japan
5251600	5253520	to play a few different sections of the game.
5253520	5257360	So one of it was a bit early on in the game
5257360	5259520	that kind of focused on,
5259520	5263120	because I guess it jumps between you as like a teenager
5263120	5265360	and you as kind of like grown up as well.
5265920	5268640	And so it started off like as a teenager
5268640	5271200	where it's more of like a combat tutorial type thing,
5271200	5272960	kind of getting used to that.
5272960	5276640	And then they threw into another section of the game
5276640	5278000	where it was just basic combat.
5278000	5281600	And then one of the, I forget what they call it now,
5281600	5286240	the, not idols, but it's basically where the giant
5286240	5288160	like a kaiju battle type thing,
5288160	5290080	where they're both the summons or whatever,
5290080	5292080	and they were doing a battle like that.
5292640	5294960	So they had those three sections of the game to play
5295680	5297440	to kind of get a taste of it.
5298640	5300480	Okay, so I actually, while you've been talking,
5300480	5301040	I pulled up,
5301040	5303280	because I actually have not watched any of this at all.
5303280	5304480	So I actually just pulled up.
5304480	5305280	I went to YouTube.
5305280	5308640	Of course, some of the extended gameplay stuff
5308640	5309840	has hit YouTube.
5310800	5313120	Interesting, because you know what it kind of evokes to me
5313120	5316240	at first is that recent Strangers of Paradise spinoff
5316240	5316880	a little bit.
5316880	5318960	It's kind of what I'm feeling a little bit from this,
5318960	5319600	but we'll see.
5319600	5320960	I mean, here's the thing.
5320960	5324800	Well, you know who's designing the game designer?
5324800	5326640	Oh yeah, the guy from Devil May Cry and all that.
5326640	5327360	Yeah, exactly.
5327360	5329440	So it plays very similar to that.
5329440	5333280	Yeah, so I'm curious about it.
5333280	5336640	And the reality is Final Fantasy has been a little rooted
5336640	5340400	more in action between 15 and the seven remake.
5340400	5342400	You know, it's just kind of the direction it's been going.
5342400	5345600	But I'm still, you know, there's certainly elements
5345600	5348640	of the classic Final Fantasies, the games I see in here.
5348640	5349360	So we'll see.
5349360	5351520	I mean, I'm not sure I'm really going to know
5351520	5353200	until I get my hands on it for myself
5353200	5355280	and make my own perceptions.
5355280	5360160	But there's definitely like graphically, very yes.
5360800	5362640	Like very yes, graphically.
5362640	5365600	Like I get like kind of like an Elden Ring, you know,
5365600	5367760	meets Final Fantasy type of vibe from it.
5367760	5370560	And I think it's going to look really good when it comes out.
5370560	5371440	We'll see.
5371440	5373680	But anyway, not only did the press preview happen,
5373680	5378800	but there were some talk about how long does the story take?
5378800	5380560	How long of a game does this take to get through?
5381440	5384560	And it's going to take about 35 hours to complete.
5385520	5387520	Apparently this will actually double
5387520	5389040	when you do side content.
5389040	5392480	There will be 11 hours worth of cut scenes.
5392480	5394320	Well, after all, it is a Final Fantasy game.
5394320	5395680	So I can't say I'm that surprised.
5396720	5398560	The main story will take 35 hours to beat.
5398560	5399840	But Yoshida added to that.
5399840	5402880	If you do 100% completion, so you do all the cut scenes,
5402880	5405200	you're looking at 70 to 80 hours.
5405200	5407440	The main story was originally going to be 20 hours.
5407440	5408320	Don't make any plans.
5408320	5409360	Yeah, don't make plans.
5409360	5411360	But this number increased during development,
5411360	5413360	which isn't surprising either.
5414080	5415920	So yeah, this number does not include cut scene
5415920	5417280	and side quests and all of that.
5417280	5419120	So there will be lots and lots.
5420720	5423520	Yoshida did say, and this is not a great
5424640	5426960	quote here, but he has said that the team has been working
5426960	5430960	to death in order to get the game finished by summer 2023.
5430960	5432480	I might have chose my words differently,
5432480	5433920	but it is what it is.
5435200	5439600	So yeah, it is set to launch in June, later in June.
5439600	5444160	So I'm trying to look at this without the ad blocking
5444160	5446320	things there, but that is, oh, that's the whole,
5446320	5448800	yeah, they have the summon versus summon fight.
5448800	5450560	So it looks like in this particular fight,
5450560	5453520	you're actually controlling either Garuda
5453520	5455920	or maybe Ifrit, I can't tell in this fight,
5457040	5459120	but you're actually doing like a summon versus summon.
5459120	5460000	It does look pretty cool.
5460640	5464240	So it's got a lot of flourish to it.
5466160	5468320	I mean, there's no, I was going to buy this game
5468320	5470400	the minute they announced that Creative Business Unit 3
5470400	5471280	was working on it.
5471280	5473440	So we'll see.
5473440	5475200	And I know I'll be streaming a lot of it as well.
5477040	5480720	Let's see, is there some comments in chat about the length?
5480720	5483760	DJ Rama S says, 35 hours, that's kind of light.
5483760	5486240	Mike Def says, I don't need 100 plus hour experiences.
5486240	5487520	Please keep it short and sweet.
5488400	5492160	I actually think 35 hours is kind of on the longer end
5492160	5493920	of where video games are at these days.
5494480	5499120	Maybe not like something a little more retro inspired
5499120	5502160	that has a lot of quests and stuff to, but keep in mind,
5502160	5505360	they all are also saying, if you do all the side quests,
5505360	5507920	which many people I know that play Final Fantasy do,
5508960	5510320	it's going to be a lot longer.
5510400	5514960	And so I'm not concerned about the time as much.
5514960	5516880	I mean, but I reserve to change my mind
5516880	5518480	once I have actually played the games.
5519040	5520960	Questbuster says, so the previews I've watched,
5520960	5522640	my impressions is that it's Final Fantasy
5522640	5524240	with the Devil May Cry feel to it.
5524240	5527040	You can swap between icon powers during battle.
5527600	5530240	Questbuster also says, I love me those side quests.
5530240	5531760	I went overboard with as many of those
5531760	5533360	in Final Fantasy 15 as possible
5533360	5535600	and maxed Noctis's party out.
5535600	5538160	Well, apparently like side quests, DLC and all that,
5538160	5541840	that's really the way to get the full Final Fantasy 15 experience.
5541840	5543680	I just hope this game, you know,
5543680	5545520	especially with the comment about this,
5545520	5547440	basically openly admitting they're crunching.
5548240	5550320	I hope with comments like that,
5550320	5555840	this game is a fully finished, fully realized product.
5555840	5558160	That's going to be the part that's disappointing to me.
5558160	5561840	As long as it's 35 solid fucking hours, then great.
5561840	5564400	But if it's 35 hours where it really feels like
5564400	5567840	another 15 are missing, which is what Final Fantasy 15 felt like,
5567840	5568880	I'm going to have some issues.
5569920	5572640	And I am willing to hold this game,
5573520	5575680	you know, accountable in the critical sense
5575680	5578560	because just because I have a fondness
5578560	5580560	of Creative Business Unit 3's previous game,
5581120	5583920	I'm probably going to be harsher than most people
5583920	5585680	on this game when it comes out, but we'll see.
5586560	5588320	I'll be playing it live for sure.
5588320	5589360	Absolutely.
5589360	5590320	Whenever it comes out.
5591360	5591760	All right.
5591760	5593600	In the meantime, let's go to Dark Sakura
5593600	5595840	and I'm going to step away from keyboard real quick.
5595840	5596340	Sorry.
5597300	5598260	You see how it is.
5598260	5599300	I talk and you leave.
5599860	5601380	I just need hydration.
5601380	5602020	Forgive me.
5602580	5603140	It's okay.
5604660	5609860	Anyway, though, for fans of games that make you hate life
5609860	5614420	and question your choices, Elden Ring is having an expansion
5614420	5616580	called Shadow of Erdtree.
5617540	5619220	It is currently in development,
5619220	5622900	according to Bandai Namco and From Software.
5623460	5626500	Um, the teaser says thus,
5627220	5630420	Rise Tarnished and let us walk a new path together.
5630420	5632900	An upcoming expansion for Elden Ring,
5632900	5635620	Shadow of the Erdtree is currently in development.
5635620	5637940	We hope you look forward to new adventures
5637940	5638900	in the Lands Between.
5639620	5642820	So yeah, there you go.
5643540	5647060	Um, there's not really a whole lot of information
5647060	5647700	out about it.
5647700	5649380	I mean, I don't play Elden Ring,
5650100	5651860	although I was tempted and then I realized
5651860	5652740	I don't hate myself.
5653300	5658740	So, but I mean, if, if people are looking forward to it,
5658740	5659940	then I'm happy for y'all.
5662580	5663080	Yeah.
5664340	5665940	Did you play Elden Ring?
5665940	5668980	Nope, there's no way I'm gonna play Elden Ring.
5668980	5672180	Yeah, I have friends that like are super into it
5672180	5674580	and, you know, die and die and die and die.
5674580	5677860	And me, I just be like, no and no and no and no.
5677860	5681460	You know, not, not me, no.
5682420	5685140	It's like, I don't, I mean,
5686180	5688260	but people like those Souls games, you know?
5689220	5693700	Um, oh, Mike Duff says it's, it's been considered
5693700	5696100	one of the most accessible Souls games.
5696740	5700980	And I mean, I would be that person that plays like
5700980	5703620	some sort of magic user that stands on a cliff
5703620	5706580	and shoots, you know, whatever happens to be
5706580	5707700	in firing range.
5707700	5709780	Which I believe is the easy way, quote unquote,
5709780	5711460	using my coin figures, easy way to play it.
5714020	5716100	And I like, I've gone in and like watched videos,
5716100	5718980	you know, like I watched, uh, the ending with
5718980	5720260	whatever the moon lady is.
5722500	5726260	Um, that was kind of cool, but, uh, I don't know.
5726260	5729860	I mean, I'm happy for Elden Ring fans getting more content.
5729860	5732980	I will be content to watch you play it and not play it myself.
5732980	5736820	Yeah. I thought you'd, a lot of DVD streamers we know,
5736820	5738820	especially the one you had lunch with today,
5738820	5740660	I have started kind of playing this in some
5740660	5742580	DVD downtime lately.
5742580	5745220	So, um, definitely a game that even a year after
5745220	5747140	it's been released is, uh, you know, kind of
5747780	5749460	getting new fans showing up.
5749460	5750420	So, yep.
5752020	5752420	Cool.
5752420	5753140	Yeah.
5753140	5753460	All right.
5753460	5754900	Um, moving on Loki.
5756420	5756740	Yeah.
5756740	5759220	So just kind of follow up to a story that we talked
5759220	5760580	about a while ago.
5761060	5764980	Yuji Naka getting in trouble with some insider trading.
5764980	5769300	Well now, apparently during the court case, um, it has been,
5770260	5772660	he has made the comment that there is no doubt.
5772660	5775940	I knew the facts about the game before it was made
5775940	5777620	public and bought the stock.
5778500	5780580	And that's not necessarily admission of like,
5780580	5783780	I did insider trading, but you got all the ingredients
5783780	5784980	for insider trading.
5784980	5787540	It almost sounds like he's pleading guilty,
5787540	5789940	but he hasn't pled guilty yet.
5789940	5792020	Well, at least he's owning up to it.
5792020	5793540	That's more than most people do.
5793540	5794500	I'll give him credit for that.
5797060	5797560	Yep.
5798260	5804500	So, um, I guess, I mean, this is a silly question to ask,
5804500	5806740	but what I, cause I was gonna ask, is this the end
5806740	5807860	of his gaming career?
5807860	5809780	And abs, obviously the answer is yes.
5809780	5810580	Oh, you think?
5810580	5810820	No.
5811860	5812900	I don't think it's the end of his gaming career.
5812900	5813940	He's gonna go to jail.
5814740	5815780	Well, you know what?
5815780	5818020	Is he going to jail or is he getting a fine?
5818820	5819620	That's, you know what?
5819620	5821380	Jail didn't end Martha Stewart's career.
5822180	5823620	So maybe, maybe you're right.
5823620	5826580	Maybe, maybe this isn't going to be the end and we don't know.
5826580	5826900	You're right.
5826900	5827860	He might not get jail.
5827860	5830100	He might just get a fine, especially if he's admitting
5830100	5830900	to guilt.
5830900	5832900	I don't know because I don't know the legal system.
5832900	5834820	I barely understand the legal system here.
5834820	5836180	I'm not going to try to understand the legal system
5836180	5837060	in Japan.
5837060	5841380	I just know certain things are viewed differently in the
5841380	5843380	culture than others, and that can go either way.
5844660	5845540	So we'll see.
5845860	5850180	Quest Buster in chat says after Ballad Wonderland and now
5850180	5850820	jail.
5850820	5854500	Well, entire class says insider trading isn't a felony,
5854500	5854740	right?
5854740	5856020	Well, Martha Stewart went to jail.
5857220	5861620	So granted, many people feel they were just trying to make
5861620	5864020	an example of her, but she does.
5864020	5868260	I mean, name a better duo than her and Snoop Dogg.
5868260	5868980	I'll wait.
5868980	5870900	Like, there really isn't one.
5870900	5873780	So I mean, her career is in a great place.
5873780	5874740	All things considered.
5874740	5875700	So I don't know.
5875700	5879220	It'd be interesting to see what happens with Yuji Naka
5879220	5880100	artistically.
5881620	5882020	Wow.
5882020	5887140	Dejirama S says if the creator of Rurouni Kenshin, who is
5887140	5890420	caught with child pornography, can get away with no jail time
5890420	5891300	and pay a fine.
5891940	5892260	Wow.
5892900	5895140	Yuji Naka is just going to get a slap on the wrist.
5896500	5896740	Wow.
5898340	5901220	Phil of Nine says Martha Stewart, the original stunt queen
5902180	5905700	and the only host of The Apprentice that has gone to jail
5905700	5906260	so far.
5908500	5909140	But we'll see.
5910900	5914260	And she went to jail and paid her dues.
5914260	5916980	I mean, I don't know.
5916980	5918740	I don't know enough facts about that case.
5918740	5921300	I don't want to sit here and go, Martha Stewart should or
5921300	5922900	shouldn't have gone to jail because I don't really know.
5922900	5925300	But it does seem like they made an example of her.
5925300	5929620	I do get the impression that she has done things that maybe
5929620	5931060	some other people should do.
5931620	5934420	Other people that have hosted The Apprentice television show
5934420	5938740	who have done other things that are worse than what Martha
5938740	5939300	Stewart did.
5940500	5941540	But what do I know?
5941540	5943540	I'm just some guy on the internet with a podcast.
5945460	5946100	All right.
5946100	5947780	Anyway, let's move on.
5948580	5951460	And for those watching live on Twitch, I see we have a special
5951460	5952340	guest star tonight.
5953060	5954580	We have Her Highness.
5954580	5955060	Yes.
5955060	5956180	Ms. Middlesbittittles.
5956500	5961060	For those listening on the podcast, Dark Sakura has a cat
5961060	5963860	not on her lap, like, literally in her arms next to the
5963860	5964740	microphone right now.
5964740	5969220	And unlike my cats, Middles is loving this attention.
5969860	5971220	No, she's tolerating it.
5971220	5971780	She's tolerating.
5971780	5972980	She's tolerating this attention.
5972980	5975620	I took her out of her warm spot because I wanted her to be
5975620	5976340	a celebrity.
5976340	5976840	Yeah.
5977540	5978100	You want down?
5978820	5979780	You want down?
5979780	5980280	All right.
5981940	5983060	Put me down, human.
5983060	5984180	And time was up.
5984980	5985300	All right.
5985300	5988180	Well, speaking of pets, let's talk about Pokemon, because
5988180	5989860	Pokemon Day happened this week.
5989860	5992740	And with that came a Pokemon Presents stream.
5993460	5996580	And so they talked about what is happening in Pokemon.
5996580	5999380	And one of the biggest pieces of news that came out is that,
5999380	6002100	yes, there is DLC coming for Scarlet and Violet.
6002100	6004660	Of course, there's DLC coming from Scarlet and Violet.
6005380	6008340	That will be coming out soon.
6008340	6010020	I'm trying to see where the dates are for that.
6012340	6013460	Fall and winter.
6013460	6013940	Thank you.
6013940	6016500	Fall and winter for the two pieces of DLC that are coming
6016500	6017620	to Scarlet and Violet.
6018180	6020980	Pokemon Go is also going to connect to Scarlet and Violet.
6020980	6022740	And I believe that started this week.
6022740	6024500	I haven't checked out that functionality yet, but I know
6024500	6028580	it has to do a gimme ghoul and his release in Pokemon Go.
6028580	6030980	So I'll have to check out that at some point.
6030980	6033300	There's also more terror raids coming as well.
6034900	6037540	The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero.
6037540	6039780	That's the name of the DLC for that.
6039780	6040260	Interesting.
6040260	6041540	So it's not two different pieces.
6041540	6043140	It's just part one and two.
6043140	6045940	Also big news from the Pokemon Presents.
6045940	6047140	Pokemon Sleep.
6047140	6047860	It's back.
6047860	6048500	It's real.
6048500	6049460	It's coming.
6049460	6052180	Pokemon Sleep is happening, and there's going to be a new
6052180	6054900	device for it even called the Pokemon Go Plus.
6056500	6059220	It's the Pokemon Go Plus Plus.
6060340	6062820	It's an ATM machine machine, literally.
6065220	6066980	The Trace Buster Buster.
6068020	6069780	But anyway, it's coming.
6069780	6072900	And if you wanted to get one too late, they're already sold
6072900	6075300	out everywhere because this is the way Nintendo products
6075300	6076740	and Nintendo affiliated.
6076740	6079940	In this case, products tend to go, but it will actually
6079940	6081300	measure your sleep and all that.
6081300	6084500	And I think you get a Snorlax in Pokemon Go with, like, a
6084500	6085700	sleepy time hat or something.
6085700	6086900	If you get one of these.
6086900	6087700	I don't know.
6087700	6090180	It sounded like a lot of extra crap to me.
6090180	6091940	I'm also I still don't.
6091940	6095060	I'm not sure I understand the point of Pokemon Sleep other
6095060	6100420	than Nintendo wants sleep data of children and adults who
6100420	6104500	like Pokemon across the US and Canada and other places.
6104500	6106500	For some reason, I don't know why they want to harvest that
6106500	6108660	sleep data, but they're going to get it.
6108660	6110660	And that's going to be interesting for whatever they
6110660	6112820	might be cooking up in the future.
6112820	6117300	So also some other things if you're big fans of the Pokemon
6117300	6120980	series, such as Zacian is coming to Pokemon Unite.
6121540	6124260	There is a new Netflix and Pokemon venture called Pokemon
6124260	6125860	Concierge that's coming.
6125860	6128340	There's a new set of Pokemon cards coming, but they'll be
6128340	6131060	announced more at the Pokemon World Championship and the
6131060	6136100	Pokemon Master Sex or the Masters EX.
6136100	6140180	But everyone calls it Pokemon Master Sex for Pokemon Master
6140180	6140740	Sex.
6140740	6144100	Leon and Charizard will be back in that.
6144100	6144820	So there's that.
6144820	6147220	And what's that?
6149220	6150500	You say the Lord, I'm done.
6150500	6151000	Bye.
6153220	6153860	People.
6153860	6154900	Yeah, yeah, I know.
6155860	6156260	All right.
6157220	6160180	S.J. 100 Matt says it's gamifying health and wellness,
6160180	6161300	and there's a market for that.
6161300	6161700	Sure.
6161700	6162820	And I eat that stuff up.
6163700	6166180	And will I play Pokemon sleep?
6166180	6166900	Probably.
6167460	6170020	Will I recognize that there is something potentially
6170020	6173940	problematic with me being so open with me sharing my sleep
6173940	6174660	data?
6174660	6175700	Probably.
6175700	6176820	But you know what?
6176820	6179860	I've been given way worse to Niantic for years.
6181060	6184100	So whatever.
6184900	6187460	Keep making the Pokemon cute, and who cares?
6188100	6190420	All right, moving on.
6190420	6195220	Let's go back to a simpler time when games weren't harvesting
6195220	6199140	all of our data in a favorite segment we like to do here
6199140	6200500	on Orange Lounge Radio.
6211060	6214100	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time,
6214100	6217460	where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic
6217460	6218820	and tell you about it.
6218820	6221460	It's time for the classic game of the week.
6222340	6223460	OK, let me see.
6223460	6226100	I think I have an audio cue for tonight's game.
6226660	6228580	Let's see if I get this timed right with the title
6228580	6229300	screen coming up.
6231140	6232100	Oh, no.
6232100	6232580	There we go.
6232580	6244340	Oh, I thought I had the song that would play in the back.
6247060	6249220	Oh, here we go from the top.
6252980	6253540	There we go.
6259540	6260580	All right.
6260580	6262260	Obviously, you all know the game at this point.
6263300	6266100	All right, so the game is Clay Fighter,
6266100	6271780	which came out for the Super Nintendo on November 15, 1993.
6272740	6277300	For PAL, it was released as Tournament Edition.
6277300	6278420	Actually, I take that back.
6278420	6280740	For PAL, it was released on May 26, 1994.
6280740	6283540	Then there were other ones like the Tournament Edition
6284100	6287620	on May 15, 1994 in North America.
6287620	6290660	Genesis got theirs June 23, 1994.
6290660	6294020	The PAL region January 1, 1995.
6294020	6297220	And Virtual Console in Europe February 6,
6297220	6301860	2009 in North America May 25, 2009.
6301860	6304820	So every version of it is over 10 years old.
6306180	6308500	So it qualifies a bunch.
6310100	6313140	At any rate, Clay Fighter is a fighting game.
6313300	6313800	Duh.
6315380	6320260	That is a parody of Street Fighter and other fighting games.
6321860	6324980	And it features like this circus theme
6324980	6328580	and has like a claymation type graphics
6329620	6332340	that were actually created with, you know,
6332340	6334740	photography and digitalizing the clay models
6334740	6338820	like something more Mortal Kombat-ish, but with clay models.
6338820	6347700	The company Visual Concepts actually had another
6347700	6350660	in their sort of clay themed franchises
6350660	6354100	that were actually made by Interplay Productions.
6354100	6357300	And one was called Claymates, which was a platformer.
6358980	6362020	There were even toys.
6362020	6363140	I don't know if they ever came out,
6363140	6367460	but in July 2020, Megalopolis toys were partnered
6367460	6371780	with Interplay to release a line of six injection figures
6371780	6373940	based on the game, which is very interesting.
6375300	6376740	Anyway, the plot is stupid.
6377380	6378660	A meteor?
6378660	6379160	What?
6380020	6381540	The plot is stupid.
6381540	6382020	It's great.
6382020	6382580	It's great.
6382580	6383940	Well, no, it is.
6383940	6384440	It is.
6385540	6388900	It's like a meteor made out of clay lands
6388900	6392100	on like a little circus.
6392100	6393940	And then all the goo from all of this
6393940	6396500	contaminates all the circus's attractions
6396500	6398900	and makes them bizarre caricatures
6398900	6401300	of what they were before, but with superpowers.
6402180	6407540	So I love like the characters in this are their names are fun.
6407540	6411860	My favorite being bad Mr. Frosty, who's a snowman.
6412580	6414980	And he has a very, very, very bad attitude.
6416180	6418340	His attacks like are throwing snowballs
6418340	6422900	and spitting sharp ice balls and sliding around.
6423860	6426820	But I like his taunt because he says, I'm bad.
6426820	6427540	I'm cool.
6427540	6428500	I'm no one's fool.
6429860	6431220	I always remembered that like that.
6431220	6434820	Mr. Frosty is like like my guy.
6438020	6442260	But there's also blob that's just like that was your guy.
6442820	6446020	He was the master of Gujitsu and he can morph
6446020	6447140	into different objects.
6447620	6449380	And there was another one that I liked,
6449380	6452500	which was blue suede goo, which is an Elvis impersonator.
6454100	6459620	And he has he fights on the keys of a piano
6459620	6463780	that says big hunk of burning clay as in hunk hunk of burning
6463780	6464280	love.
6464900	6468900	And of course, his name's a parody of blue suede shoes
6468900	6470260	from the 1950s.
6471140	6473300	Bonker is a clown, so I never played him.
6473940	6475940	Bonker is a clown, so I never played him.
6477860	6481940	He has like pies and cartwheels and a spring flower
6481940	6482900	and a huge hammer.
6483780	6487220	And he's got like two fun houses.
6487220	6488580	One's a clown head and the other's
6488580	6489940	like a giant rubber ducky.
6492180	6494340	And then there's Helga, who is my other one,
6494340	6497460	who is basically the proverbial fat lady that
6497460	6498820	sings at the end of the opera.
6499780	6502420	You know, totally wearing like the Viking attire.
6503860	6506900	And she's actually the rival of blue suede goo.
6508260	6509540	And my main for the record.
6510900	6514100	My main for the record, because I always played women
6514100	6514820	in fighting games.
6514820	6515320	Always.
6515940	6519140	Well, she would like launch herself like with her full head
6520260	6522340	and like because she had the horns on her head
6522340	6525780	and then she would also do like the sonic scream,
6525780	6527780	you know, the operatic thing.
6528580	6533140	And she's actually the first opponent in single player mode
6533140	6534580	and she has like an opera theater.
6535220	6537860	Then there's Ichibod Clay, who we're actually
6537860	6541540	seeing on the video fighting against the next one, Taffy.
6541540	6544740	But Ichibod Clay is a scarecrow with a pumpkin head
6544740	6547220	who can teleport and throw ectoplasm.
6548020	6552660	The next one is Taffy, who is a gooey.
6553300	6554420	He's basically Gumby.
6554980	6557060	Yeah, I don't know.
6557700	6560340	I think he's like, he looks more like a tapeworm to me.
6560340	6563620	But anyway, he can twist himself up and spin
6563620	6565140	and flail his arms.
6565140	6567620	And in one player mode, he actually,
6568580	6572180	his levels are like two different Taffy factories.
6572180	6575540	And then there's Tiny, which is a buff,
6575540	6579300	very toothy wrestler character who poses.
6579940	6581540	But he doesn't actually use wrestling moves.
6581540	6582580	He just punches.
6582580	6584820	He charges and punches and rolls into a ball
6584820	6586580	and throws himself at people.
6588740	6592100	And then the final boss is called End Boss,
6592100	6598260	End Period Boss, that looks like a ring of balls
6599300	6601220	or maybe like a weird necklace.
6602020	6606420	And it has round eyes, one open, one half closed.
6607060	6608740	And it attacks with projectiles that
6608740	6611220	are copied from other characters in a grab attack.
6611460	6613380	He does not appear to be made of clay
6613380	6616900	and the announcer does not enter, announce his name
6617620	6622100	at the start or when he wins, which is like,
6622100	6623860	he's just put in there so that someone,
6623860	6625460	they have a boss, I guess.
6627540	6630180	And he uses the purple meteor as his arena,
6631060	6633300	which is actually a palette swap of a blob stage.
6634260	6636260	Although in Clay Fighter Tournament Edition,
6636260	6637940	he has his own arena.
6638900	6644500	His name is actually based on M. Bison and End Boss.
6645380	6647300	So End Boss, yay.
6648580	6652020	Anyway, the development, there's actually a really good,
6652020	6654980	I think it's on Gaming Historian or one of those ones.
6654980	6656100	Oh yeah, that's End Boss.
6658260	6660260	I fast forwarded the clip since you were talking about it.
6660260	6660760	Okay.
6661620	6664900	But just talking about the game's development.
6664900	6668340	So basically it was developed by Visual Concepts
6668340	6669460	and published by Interplay.
6670340	6675700	The president, Greg Thomas, said that they really just
6675700	6679140	wanted something new and funny, you know,
6679140	6682260	an alternative to all the violent fighting stuff.
6682820	6687700	And so they looked to different animation experts,
6687700	6691700	Ken Pontak, David Blyman of Danger Productions
6691700	6692900	in Brisbane, California.
6693540	6697060	And then they spent a year developing Clay Fighter.
6698180	6700740	Once they had it, had the character's design,
6700740	6703700	they molded the characters using different types of clay.
6705940	6709860	Like Taffy was created with a stronger type than Blob.
6709860	6712820	And they had all kinds of different models and everything.
6712820	6715460	And then they animated them using stop motion animation.
6716340	6721060	So basically it was a video camera linked to an Amiga computer
6721780	6726020	that had a graphics editor that digitized the figures.
6726740	6732260	And then they were saying that, you know,
6732820	6739380	this part was like a big portion of the development
6739380	6742660	to make it scriptable, you know,
6742660	6744580	to use the scripting language for the animation
6744580	6746500	and to digitize everything.
6746500	6747780	It was very long and tedious.
6748420	6751540	And Interplay added in a lot with Project
6751540	6753780	by creating new character moves
6753780	6756180	with different spliced animation sequences.
6757620	6760260	They also recorded the musical score,
6760260	6761620	the voices, the sound effects.
6762660	6765780	And they said the design was originally supposed to compete
6765780	6767940	with Mortal Kombat without the heavy violence.
6769780	6776420	But Interplay pushed the game saying that parents,
6777140	6778020	this is a quote here,
6778020	6779780	parents who object to blood and guts games
6779780	6781540	now have an alternative title
6781540	6784100	that gives kids the kind of intense action
6784100	6786500	they want to see in fighting games to make more sales.
6787300	6791460	So in 94, we got Clay Fighter Tournament Edition
6792180	6793780	that was exclusive.
6793780	6797540	It was originally a rental, excuse me,
6797540	6798580	through Blockbuster Video.
6799460	6800900	And it improved on Clay Fighter.
6800900	6803220	It fixed glitches, added different backgrounds,
6803220	6805460	offered difficulty setting speeds versus mode.
6807220	6809620	And then of course, when the Genesis version came out,
6809620	6811780	which did not look nearly as good as the SNES ones,
6813060	6814500	that's the version that actually made it
6814500	6816100	on the Wii Virtual Console.
6818180	6821780	There is a port of Clay Fighter for the Atari Jaguar
6821780	6823860	that was in the works, but never released.
6824980	6826500	So there were sequels,
6826500	6830020	and I might even jump in and do one of these sequels later,
6830020	6831220	but I'll give a brief rundown.
6832340	6835460	The sequels were Clay Fighter II Judgment Clay,
6835540	6836820	as in like Terminator 2.
6838420	6841540	That was on SNES in 1995,
6841540	6845540	and then Clay Fighter 63 1 3 for the Nintendo 64.
6846180	6847700	And then it had a special edition
6847700	6850980	called Clay Fighter Sculptor's Cut in 98,
6850980	6853620	which was also only available as a rental
6853620	6856100	at Blockbuster Video in North America.
6856100	6859700	It had, it included four additional characters,
6859700	6863140	High Five, Lady Liberty, Lockjaw A Pooch,
6863140	6864740	and Zappa Yow Yow Boys.
6866420	6869060	They were actually cut out of the original release
6869060	6870500	for 63 1 3.
6872660	6874820	And, you know, they changed some stuff up to it,
6874820	6877940	but Sculptor's Cut is actually considered
6877940	6879540	to be one of the rarest games released
6879540	6881780	for the Nintendo 64.
6881780	6885380	There were only 20,000 copies ever produced.
6886500	6888980	In September 2009, Interplay announced
6888980	6891620	a return of Clay Fighter for WiiWare in DSi,
6891620	6894420	but then they were canceled, sorry, DSiWare.
6895300	6899060	March 2015, Interplay revealed a remastered Clay Fighter
6899060	6901060	was to be released in 2016,
6901860	6904100	and had a partnership with Drip Drop Games.
6904100	6906740	It was gonna have more than 20 characters
6906740	6909540	and 20 familiar environments,
6909540	6912980	Clay-alities, new mechanics like double jumping,
6912980	6914740	air dashing, counters, and reversals.
6914740	6917220	The game has been canceled and Interplay sold
6917220	6919780	the intellectual rights of Clay Fighter
6919780	6921140	and many of their titles.
6921140	6922660	I don't think it says to whom.
6923620	6925940	Anyway, Clay Fighter was awarded
6925940	6929460	the Best Street Fighter Wannabe of 1993 by EGM,
6929460	6930900	Electronic Games Monthly,
6930900	6933060	and was awarded the best sound effects,
6933060	6934660	and also for having the best ad.
6936660	6940180	It sold 200,000 copies by the end of 94.
6940820	6943700	Game Pro said that the Genesis port was pretty positive,
6945700	6949060	but I think they were also saying
6949060	6951060	that it just wasn't, it looked as good,
6951060	6955060	although they thought that the six button Genesis controller
6955060	6958180	made it the ideal version to play it on, you know?
6959460	6965860	But at any rate, if we're gonna go into the rankings on things,
6965860	6971460	I mean, it got kind of middle to positive reviews.
6972500	6974900	Nintendo Power gave it a 15 out of 20.
6977460	6980020	Video games and computer entertainment gave it 8 out of 10.
6980020	6981860	Eurogamer gave it a 5 out of 10.
6981860	6985540	EGM for SNES gave it a 30 of 40,
6985540	6987860	and then Mega Drive a 6.6 out of 10.
6987860	6993380	So yeah, it was, I mean, I'm gonna go on record saying,
6993380	6995460	this is not the best fighting game.
6995460	6997860	It really isn't, but it's fun.
6998420	6999060	Yeah.
6999060	7000660	And it's a lot of fun.
7000660	7004260	The technology was really clever for its time too.
7004260	7006500	You know, the whole concept of, you know,
7006500	7009300	instead of capturing live actors like a Mortal Kombat,
7009380	7013300	capturing claymation, I think was just a really fun idea.
7013300	7015540	This game, you know, the fun that they were trying to do
7015540	7016820	with this game really comes through,
7016820	7019220	even if mechanically it's less fun.
7020260	7020660	Yeah.
7020660	7024500	And honestly, like, I totally wish that we would have
7024500	7026180	another Clay Fighter game come out.
7026820	7029780	Like, I would be so down for that,
7029780	7031780	especially with our technology now.
7031780	7032580	I don't disagree.
7033380	7038900	Like, I mean, they could do the whole thing CG, you know?
7040260	7042500	But, you know, have like really good clay
7044180	7045540	textures applied to it.
7045540	7046040	Yeah.
7046500	7050020	I mean, it would, if you were gonna do like
7050020	7053620	a stop motion animation character game right now,
7054740	7058260	to have it work for our modern sets,
7059220	7064660	you would have to do so many in-betweens, right?
7064660	7065300	Sure.
7065300	7069380	To have it fit like a 60 FPS frame rate, for example.
7070340	7075220	So that would mean, like, for every second of motion,
7075220	7078980	you would have 60 different animated frames.
7080020	7082980	And I'll do that by however much.
7082980	7083480	Yeah.
7084740	7088500	But yeah, and I think it's time to bring back
7088500	7090740	these characters and give them love.
7091940	7094260	I want to know who has the license now, though.
7094340	7095940	I'd have to look it up and I'm too lazy.
7096500	7098180	So yeah, Clay Fighter.
7098900	7099400	All right.
7100580	7101540	Clay Fighter.
7101540	7102500	Clay, Clay Fighter.
7102500	7102820	Good.
7102820	7103620	I just always liked it.
7103620	7105220	Like, it felt like the music would stop
7105220	7108820	and then the singer would go and then keep going.
7108820	7111780	If nothing else, we just need a bitchin' new theme song
7111780	7112500	from the team.
7112500	7113220	That's what we need.
7113860	7116820	Yeah, but it's still all about that, Mr. Frosty.
7116820	7117460	All right.
7117460	7120020	Classic game of the week, Clay Fighter.
7120020	7120900	Good pick.
7120900	7121400	All right.
7122100	7123780	We're about two hours in and I know we have
7123780	7125300	some long emails tonight, so I want to make sure
7125300	7126100	we get to those.
7126100	7126740	We do?
7126740	7128740	Yeah, we have two that I saw.
7128740	7132500	So before we get there, we will get through the rest
7132500	7132900	of the news.
7132900	7134420	So let's just keep it moving.
7134420	7136740	We're going to go to rapid fire news and rapidly talk
7136740	7137300	about some news.
7137300	7137800	Loki.
7138340	7138660	Yes.
7138660	7142100	So this is cool if you're looking to get into some VR,
7142100	7143620	but don't want to spend as much money.
7144260	7147300	The meta quest is dropping in price, or at least
7147300	7148340	the meta quest two.
7148340	7152180	So they've confirmed that they're dropping the 256 gigabyte
7152180	7156820	model down from $499 to $429.
7156820	7159140	And I think that's supposed to be a permanent price drop.
7159140	7163220	Also, the Quest Pro, which was super expensive for what
7163220	7167700	you got, $1,500 is now dropping down to only $1,000.
7168420	7170260	So something.
7170260	7171780	And that took effect today.
7172660	7175700	So if you're in the United States or Canada, you can enjoy
7175700	7178340	those lower prices or just wait for them to announce the
7178340	7179780	quest three, because that's probably why they dropped
7179780	7180740	the price in the first place.
7182180	7185940	Speaking of lower prices for consoles, if you are a Verizon
7185940	7191300	customer, you have until April 30th to pick up an Xbox Series
7191300	7193300	S for only $150.
7194180	7195940	It's half off its retail price.
7195940	7200100	If you're a Verizon customer, I am.
7200100	7203460	But I already have a Series X, so that's no good for me.
7203460	7205700	Still a Series S together with Game Pass.
7205700	7208180	Pretty good way to get your foot in the door with current
7208180	7208680	gaming.
7209220	7209720	For sure.
7210680	7212440	Dark Zagre, you have a quick story for us.
7214120	7214620	I do.
7215240	7219480	And actually, I've watched a lot of gameplay because Jack
7219480	7224440	Danger has one of these or had one of these on his Twitch
7224440	7226440	channel, because of course he does.
7227720	7228920	Foo Fighters Pinball.
7229880	7232840	And Dan and I were talking about this while we were watching
7232840	7237080	you play it, that, oh, it's kind of weird.
7237080	7238040	It's kind of niche.
7238040	7241080	But then we saw it in play, and it looks really freaking
7241080	7241580	fun.
7243080	7245880	They, Stern did release a trailer about it.
7245880	7249480	They didn't actually show anything of the actual game, but
7249480	7254840	it has different custom drawn animation, including like
7254840	7255340	this.
7256760	7259800	The article describes it as a Ghostbusters cartoon vibe.
7259800	7265080	I think of it almost more a little bit like a combination
7265080	7266760	of Scooby Doo and Ghostbusters.
7268680	7269720	Yep, exactly.
7269720	7272760	As Bobby said it, he was the designer of the game.
7274120	7276680	But I mean, it's really fun.
7276680	7281560	And of course, it's got their music in the game.
7282440	7284600	And everybody.
7284600	7288280	So right now it has, of course, Dave Grohl, Chris Shifflett
7288280	7292840	and Pat Smear, Nate Mendel, Rami Jaffee, and their late
7292840	7300440	drummer Taylor Hawkins are all in the movies in the game.
7300440	7303560	I'm glad they were able to get Taylor in the game after all.
7303560	7304060	Yeah.
7305720	7308200	But it's just a trip.
7308200	7313080	I mean, it really is like just it looks like super, super
7313080	7313580	fun.
7314520	7317800	SSJ100 Matt says all the Gen X fans are becoming tables,
7317800	7319240	and I don't hate it, right?
7319240	7321160	Where's my nine inch nails pinball table?
7323160	7323880	I love that.
7325400	7327880	I mean, I'll be honest.
7327880	7331240	I would want this over some of the ones that we have.
7332360	7334760	I'm pretty sure we will never have a Depeche Mode pinball.
7334760	7336360	I'm just going to say that right now.
7336360	7339080	We would have nine inch nails before we had Cure in Depeche Mode.
7341080	7341640	I don't know.
7342360	7344280	A Cure pinball table would be kind of.
7345000	7347800	I don't think Robert Smith would go for that.
7348520	7349080	You never know.
7349480	7352760	But I'm very sure Depeche Mode would not.
7354280	7354780	Probably not.
7355320	7359560	Yeah, but at any rate, at any rate, though, it just looks like so much fun.
7359560	7360920	I love the art style.
7361480	7362520	So, yeah.
7362520	7363020	Yeah.
7364600	7366840	What's Jack Danger's pinball channel again?
7366840	7368040	I just know it's him.
7371320	7373560	But if you dead flip, that's it.
7373560	7374060	Dead flip.
7374860	7379260	If you go back, like, I think it was either yesterday or the day before,
7379260	7384940	but go back on Dead Flip's Twitch and you can see some footage of the game.
7387100	7387340	All right.
7387340	7392380	Well, real quick, I'm just going to mention that Splatoon 3 got a 3.0 update.
7392380	7398460	It just launched this past week, and most of it is to support the additional DLC that's incoming,
7398460	7404300	the Inkopolis DLC, which again, still makes no sense to me why this is an interesting thing at
7404300	7408540	all, but it's there and allows you to travel between the old town and the new town.
7408540	7409020	Cool.
7409020	7411900	I guess it's all the same shit.
7411900	7413980	It's weird, but okay.
7413980	7416620	But there were other things that they're being added.
7416620	7423340	Things about fresh season 2023 with a new catalog, new gear, a new gear brand, 126 new items,
7423340	7425740	two new battle stages, two new special weapons.
7425740	7426780	You get where I'm going with this.
7426780	7431500	There is a lot of other new stuff that's being launched with the fresh season 2023 that's coming
7431500	7432140	as well.
7432140	7433740	It gets really into the weeds.
7433740	7437980	I don't have time during rapid fire to talk about some of these intricate changes to
7437980	7442860	multiplayers, like what are some of the special weapons they have and some of the new weapons
7442860	7443980	coming into shops.
7443980	7448620	But for folks that are playing the game, I'm sure there's a lot of cool stuff here.
7448620	7453020	I noticed this interesting note, changes to connectivity made it so that players will
7453020	7454940	be notified when their connection is unstable.
7454940	7459580	If the connection continues to be unstable, player controls will temporarily be disabled.
7459580	7461100	That's very interesting.
7461100	7464540	So yeah, also some Splatfest changes.
7464540	7471340	Basically, it looks like they're kind of make a changing Splatfest TXP across the board
7472140	7476220	to 7500 each stage as opposed to this incrementing thing.
7476220	7477660	So it's kind of interesting.
7477660	7481420	So check it out if you're a Splatoon fan and I'm still with that.
7482140	7485740	That all being said, let's travel around the world and check out some games you can check
7485740	7488460	out this week as they release starting with the US.
7488460	7488860	Loki.
7489900	7493340	Yes, so what a great one to start with.
7493340	7501020	We have Romansylvania on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox series.
7502300	7508300	Caverns of Mars Recharged on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox
7508380	7509900	1, and Xbox series.
7510780	7517820	Clash Artifacts of Chaos on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox 1, and Xbox series.
7518540	7522140	Fatal Frame Mask of the Lunar Eclipse.
7522140	7528700	That's on a PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox 1, and Xbox series.
7530140	7533260	Looks like Ib on Nintendo Switch.
7534060	7539340	Oni Road to Be the Mightiest Oni on Nintendo Switch.
7541900	7549660	Paranormal Sight, The Seven Mysteries of Honjo on Nintendo Switch, iOS, and Android.
7550780	7557340	We have Ray's Arcade Chronology on Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4.
7558140	7561820	Oh, so that's, I guess, based off the Ray Force series.
7562780	7572620	And then looks like Mato Anomalies on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5,
7572620	7574780	Xbox 1, and Xbox series.
7574780	7575820	And that is it.
7576540	7579740	All right, traveling to Japan, it's actually a lot of the same stuff, so I'll try to move
7579740	7580460	through this quickly.
7580460	7586620	On the Nintendo Switch, we have Ray's Arcade Chronology in a regular and limited edition.
7587180	7588540	And I'm trying to see what games are in that.
7588540	7590860	Oh, it's Ray Force, Ray Storm, Ray Crisis.
7590860	7591900	That's why they call it Ray's.
7593020	7594620	This is such a good series.
7594620	7596620	Yeah, so that's coming out on the Switch this week.
7597260	7601260	And then we also have Melon Journey, Bittersweet Memories, Fatal Frame, Mask of the Lunar
7601260	7608700	Eclipse, Record of, excuse me, that's only a US, Ib is also out in Japan this week, as
7608700	7612620	well as that Oni Road to Be the Mightiest Oni, that's out in Japan as well.
7613580	7616460	And Chef Life, a restaurant simulator.
7617100	7619420	Yes, that is out as well in Japan this week.
7619420	7623100	Checking out the PlayStation 5, some crossovers as well.
7623100	7626780	You still have that Oni Road to Be the Mightiest Oni is out there as well.
7626780	7631340	And the Melon Journey, Bittersweet Memories, those are crossing over to the PlayStation
7631340	7632460	5 this week.
7632460	7634060	But otherwise, that is it.
7634060	7635420	How about the UK, Dark Sakura?
7636780	7638140	Just a handful of things.
7638780	7642380	It looks like we get Train Life, a railway simulator for Switch.
7644140	7649900	Also on the ninth, we get for PlayStation and Xbox, Monster Energy Supercross 6.
7650540	7652620	For Switch, we get Session Skatesim.
7653420	7660460	On the 10th, we get for the big three, we get DC Justice League, Cosmic Chaos.
7661020	7663660	PlayStation and Switch, we get My Life Pet Vet.
7664460	7667820	Also on the two, we get Crazy Chicken Traps and Treasures.
7669100	7671260	On PlayStation, we get Game Deck.
7672300	7675820	And then on the big three, we get Mato anomalies.
7677260	7677760	All right.
7678780	7680700	Let's do some more stories here.
7680700	7683980	And I'm going to be honest, I'm starting to get a little tired as we're moving on.
7683980	7686780	I think that's just me being exhausted from everything last week.
7686780	7690860	So I'm maybe fighting off whatever Alan has probably passed on.
7691260	7699420	So let's move through these stories and wrap up the show.
7699420	7701740	So let's get to this from Loki.
7702700	7703200	Yes.
7703200	7713340	So we have a new number one subscribed Twitch star, I guess if you will, Kai Sennett.
7713340	7723580	He is a 21-year-old African-American Twitch streamer who has now beat Ludwig as the most
7723580	7729660	subscribed Twitch, I guess, streamer.
7729660	7735580	And he, I guess what's notable, I guess they said because he did that the last week of
7735580	7737740	February is a Black History Month type of thing.
7737740	7743100	I guess it's a nice coincidence, but it's cool to see, though, more rising stars kind
7743100	7744700	of coming through the whole Twitch scene.
7744700	7750380	He streams a lot of, I guess, Fortnite, Grand Theft Auto 5, NBA 2K, 23, and that type of
7750380	7750880	stuff.
7751340	7754780	Plus that collabs with a lot of different hip hop artists as well.
7756540	7757900	Well, congratulations.
7757900	7758400	Good.
7758700	7759980	All right, DarkSakura.
7759980	7774300	So Sega has put out a survey asking for opinions on a certain number of games.
7775180	7780620	So the ones that have been on the list, there's actually a few.
7780620	7789580	We have Judgment, Golden Axe, Streets of Rage, Shinobi, Crazy Taxi, Jet Set Radio,
7790860	7794380	Altered Beast, House of the Dead, and Virtua Fighter.
7794380	7798620	And basically it's like, you know, you get three options.
7798620	7801740	Never heard of it, heard of it, but never played it or played a game from it.
7803420	7809900	So I think that they're trying to garner who knows these IPs and who would be likely to
7809980	7810480	play it.
7811180	7819580	So, I mean, Bloomberg did report that Sega, this is actually last April, that Sega was
7819580	7825020	investing in their back catalog, working on reboots for Crazy Taxi and Jet Set Radio.
7826380	7827900	So who knows?
7828460	7830940	And of course we have the Samba game got recently announced.
7830940	7835420	So this isn't completely, completely, completely a surprise that Sega is dipping back in this
7835420	7837900	Dreamcast Classics catalog, but good.
7838700	7839980	I want them to bring knights.
7842220	7843660	Why do we not have any more knights?
7843660	7844380	We need more knights.
7845020	7846300	We need to go get on that survey.
7847420	7848540	We got Balan Wonderworld.
7848540	7850300	I mean, that's basically the same thing, right?
7850300	7851100	Stop.
7851100	7851600	All right.
7853260	7853740	All right.
7853740	7854700	Let's move on.
7854700	7855200	Loki.
7857100	7857600	Okay.
7857900	7861180	Well, this is a pretty cool deal as well.
7861180	7864860	So there's a brand new Humble Bundle and oh my God, we ever talk about Humble Bundle.
7864860	7866380	That hasn't happened in years.
7868060	7876780	They have 72 games for 30, or at least as little as $30 as part of a Syria Turkey Relief
7876780	7877580	Bundle.
7877580	7880140	And there's lots of big games in there as well.
7880780	7887740	So we've got such things as like Gotham Knights, Ghostrunner, System Shock 2, XCOM 2,
7887740	7893820	Payday 2, Mountain Blade, Warband, lots of different games in there.
7893820	7899340	I definitely picked it up because, you know, got to add to my number of games I don't play.
7901340	7902380	Too true.
7902380	7904700	But Gotham Knights being in this bundle.
7904700	7907660	I mean, that game is like not even six months old.
7907660	7908380	My goodness.
7908380	7909740	No, it's very recent.
7910460	7913100	Yeah, lots and lots of things to check out in there.
7913100	7917340	Yeah, there's a lot in this, but it looks like they've raised as of right now, two and
7917340	7918300	a half million and counting.
7918860	7919740	So nice for them.
7919740	7923020	All right.
7923020	7924700	And one more story for you.
7926060	7931420	Who doesn't love the classic game Zero Wing and the earliest earliest of internet memes,
7932060	7936780	including Move Every Zig and All Your Base Are Belong to Us, of course.
7937660	7939020	This is interesting, though.
7939020	7946220	So Topland has, you know, Topland publisher Bitwave.
7946220	7947100	Toaplan.
7947100	7947900	Toaplan, excuse me.
7947900	7949180	I always say Toaplan.
7949260	7956220	Toaplan is the publisher Bitwave is going to be doing an update for this collection.
7956220	7962940	It has changes and fixes, and they're adding the introduction sequence for the arcade version
7962940	7967820	of Zero Wing because it didn't exist in the original version.
7967820	7970140	It was in the Mega Drive port.
7970140	7973820	There was no introduction in the original coin op edition.
7973820	7979980	So now there is a brand new introduction with new hand drawn artwork that is available.
7979980	7983260	They're also trying to target some of the other things that have been noticed by hardcore
7983260	7987900	fans, you know, basically, you know, some of the little control issues and things of
7987900	7988700	that sort.
7988700	7991100	I just want to see really quickly if I can bring it up here.
7992140	7993100	What this might look like.
7993100	7999420	Oh, my gosh, this is it really is pretty similar to what you had before.
8000060	8005180	And it's even I'm turning on the music a little bit.
8005900	8007660	We are getting a signal on screen.
8009500	8011100	Main screen turned on.
8011100	8015740	Yeah, it's pretty much what you remember.
8015740	8018300	But just with that right.
8018300	8019420	How are you gentlemen?
8021020	8025100	Is that art style that you would your base are belong to us?
8025100	8025500	Perfect.
8025500	8026380	We'll end on that note.
8026380	8034620	Um, it is what an arcade machine of that era might look like, to be honest.
8036540	8037100	It's great.
8038380	8042060	I'm glad that they went back and added that just for that effect.
8042060	8042780	It's amazing.
8043500	8047180	And of course, of course, they kept the line as is, of course they did.
8047180	8052140	That would be like, okay, can you imagine they've re translated Final Fantasy four,
8052140	8055660	I don't know how many times they are not allowed to get rid of the line.
8055660	8057020	You spoonie bard.
8057020	8057580	Guess what?
8057580	8060620	In Japanese, he did not say you spoonie bard.
8060620	8063260	That was a silly translation of that era.
8063820	8065980	They did like the equivalent of you son of a bitch.
8066860	8068060	Basically, it's you asshole.
8068060	8069180	Yeah, you jerk.
8069180	8073660	But obviously, to make it family friendly, some liberties were taken by the translator
8073660	8075660	and it became you spoonie bard.
8075660	8080940	And now your spoonie belongs to us.
8080940	8081580	I can't.
8083900	8085340	All right, you know what?
8085420	8086460	I'm officially done.
8086460	8087820	Let's go to the mailbag.
8087820	8089500	Every week we invite your emails.
8090060	8092940	Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
8092940	8093580	Who said that?
8093580	8094540	I was even looking at chat.
8094540	8095420	Who said that?
8095420	8095980	Fifth Dream.
8096780	8097740	Fifth Dream.
8097740	8098460	Gold Star.
8098460	8099020	Gold Star.
8099020	8100140	All right, wait a second.
8100140	8104300	I have to explain something to SSJ100Matt about I am error.
8105820	8109180	There was another character who was named Bagu.
8110380	8110700	Bug.
8112060	8113100	Error and bug.
8115980	8117420	Cute.
8117420	8120380	The name was not a mistranslation.
8121900	8130220	Bagu was more like a direct romanization of how bug would be pronounced, you know, in
8130220	8131420	Japanese, I guess.
8132380	8135020	So no, they were error and bug.
8135820	8137500	Well, how about you know what?
8137500	8141180	Why don't we get Bagu an error in a future Zelda game?
8141180	8142780	Whatever happened to those two?
8142780	8143740	That's what I want to know.
8144140	8145740	Maybe we'll find out in Tears of the Kingdom.
8145740	8146460	Do you know Bagu?
8148540	8149100	I do.
8149100	8150380	I do know the Bagu.
8150380	8152300	No, he was the bridge guy, wasn't he?
8152300	8152800	Yeah.
8154540	8156700	I know my classics once in a while.
8157420	8157920	Yeah.
8158860	8159420	Anywho.
8159420	8166060	Especially that one because I actually beat that one as a kid and beating Zelda 2 is one
8166060	8168140	of those like Gold Star gamer achievement.
8168140	8169180	I actually beat that one.
8169180	8170300	It wasn't easy, but I did it.
8170300	8171580	Okay, beat the guardian legend.
8173740	8174240	I'll try.
8178700	8179340	Oh, yeah.
8179340	8181900	No, Gwen brought up like my favorite line.
8182460	8188060	Sit your ass down in your chair and drink your goddamn tea from Sid.
8188060	8189180	This tea is delicious.
8190860	8193980	That I have that line perfectly memorized.
8193980	8194460	I love it.
8194460	8195580	Okay, so email.
8195580	8198620	Participate at orangeandrea.com.
8198620	8199420	All right.
8199420	8201420	First one comes from Ranchan.
8201420	8203980	There were some very interesting things that were discussed.
8203980	8206540	I'd like to take a few minutes to discuss if you don't mind.
8206540	8208140	Number one, working from home.
8208140	8210620	I know this is a hotly discussed topic outside of gaming.
8210620	8214300	I do remember reading that the team behind Tiny Tina's Wonderlands would have been longer
8214300	8217500	if the team wasn't remote, which to me does make sense.
8217500	8219740	I do understand that not every job can be remote.
8219740	8221420	Mine can be hybrid, but it's on site.
8221420	8222860	I like going to work in my office.
8222860	8228220	You're required to be on site unless the role you have is coded for remote.
8229100	8231820	And if you're on site, you must be fully vaccinated and boosted.
8231820	8233100	I will say this, though.
8233100	8237580	During the beginning of the pandemic, a famous talent agency required everyone to come into
8237580	8240300	the office and they lost a lot of good people.
8240300	8246140	Now, the talent agency I worked for moved and everyone moved everyone to laptops and
8246140	8249900	sent people home for the majority of the period.
8249900	8255340	And now we just expanded one of our floors because oddly enough, more people want to
8255340	8256620	come into the office right now.
8256620	8261980	We're not at full capacity, but you can see the camaraderie among the associates on the
8261980	8265340	floor, something you don't you can't really get when working from home.
8266780	8267280	OK.
8269260	8272220	Yeah, I mean, some people prefer me.
8272860	8280220	My job can be done just as efficiently at the office or at home because of what I do.
8281420	8285500	But it does make it hard for something that should be a collaborative effort.
8286380	8288140	So, yeah, I mean, I get it.
8289340	8289840	Well said.
8291020	8294860	It's just the opposite for me, because if I go into the office and they'll see how annoyed
8294860	8299020	at the other people I am, it's best that they don't see me in the office.
8300140	8304220	I'm just glad that I face inward toward my computer.
8304220	8307980	When you face your computer, no one can see you eye roll, although they can hear it.
8307980	8312620	My job, I work with offices up and down the state, so I would be kind of like remote.
8312620	8316700	My team is up and down the state, too, so I would be kind of remote working anyway.
8316700	8319980	So it's an interesting kind of predicament I'm in.
8319980	8324220	The interesting change is that I don't and all of us don't travel.
8324220	8328300	Like back in the day, I probably would have flown down to Southern California once every
8328300	8332540	few months to see the team there and that's off the table.
8332540	8334780	So we have to connect on Zoom and do other things.
8334780	8340140	But I think a lot of companies are still trying to find their rhythm with all of that.
8340700	8343980	What does this, using my quotey fingers, new normal look like?
8343980	8349980	Because number one, obviously, COVID and the pandemic, it's still a thing whether society's
8349980	8350700	over it or not.
8351340	8358140	Whether they declare it endemic status or whatever, the reality is people's perception
8358140	8363900	of what work can be and the fact that people know full damn well they can do their jobs
8363900	8366940	at home have really changed the game.
8366940	8370860	People that are looking for jobs are looking for jobs that they can do remotely.
8370860	8372540	It's interesting.
8373580	8379740	I will say there's been some good things for going back into the office and the fact
8379740	8384140	that it's actually improved my ability to go out and be around people.
8385660	8390940	I feel like as I'm adjusting more to being around people, some of my social anxiety has
8390940	8391900	certainly decreased.
8392780	8396300	But I'm also a, if it fucks me up, face it kind of person.
8397740	8400460	And it's been really good because I'm friends.
8401180	8401900	I work with Drew.
8406460	8410140	My work buddies are like my other family, sort of.
8411340	8413020	So I like going in and seeing them.
8413020	8414780	I certainly love going to the cafeteria.
8415740	8423500	Also, right now, Melody is sort of one of my co-workers, but in the big office.
8424940	8426540	So we chat at work.
8429020	8429820	So the next part.
8430780	8432300	The game that is not mentioned.
8432300	8432860	Oh shit.
8433980	8438140	Now I know this game has caused a lot of controversy and yes, Rob, the boycotting on this game
8438140	8439420	did indeed backfire.
8439420	8441180	I have no desire to play this game.
8441180	8442460	I know people who do.
8442460	8446540	They can separate the art from the artist and that's them, but I will not berate someone
8446540	8447500	for playing it.
8447500	8450300	That falls under the rule of fuck around and find out.
8450300	8455500	I won't go into any further on my thoughts on the game because the three of you said
8455500	8455980	it already.
8455980	8458380	Y'all said it in a way that I could not, and I thank you for it.
8459260	8463820	And as for Jamie going beyond this and talking about how to help and support marginalized
8463820	8465820	people, I could give you a great big hug.
8465820	8467100	Oh, you make me feel good.
8467100	8469260	You are the epitome of ally support for us.
8469820	8475180	I honestly feel that those who do not know the struggle should take a page from y'all's
8475180	8476140	support book and learn.
8476140	8480780	And while we're here, I know that it was discussed how Saudi Arabia's investment in
8480780	8483420	Nintendo does not sit well with us.
8483420	8485580	The issue that Nintendo doesn't know.
8486540	8489820	The issue is that Nintendo doesn't know the issue and does not care.
8489820	8494300	For example, there was a Saudi Arabian cosplay contest with a top prize of 10 grand.
8494300	8498700	A lot of American cosplayers boycotted it where European, Asian, and other international
8498700	8500060	cosplayers entered.
8500060	8503900	Their reason was simply what's going on between the US and Saudi Arabia has nothing to do
8503900	8504540	with me.
8504540	8505740	So much for solidarity.
8507180	8508220	And one more thing, Rob.
8508220	8511420	I know that you've mentioned on how the show can get political.
8511420	8511740	Fuck it.
8511740	8512700	Let it be.
8512700	8516380	The topics that come up affect all of us one way or another, and we need to know.
8516380	8520460	For some people, podcasts are the only way people find out anything, so please keep
8520460	8521020	it up.
8521020	8523820	There's a lot more I want to discuss, but the show is only so long.
8523820	8525180	That's all for now.
8525180	8526300	Take care, one and all.
8527020	8527900	That's from Rajan.
8527900	8531500	To be clear on the politics thing, it's not that I want to completely steer clear of politics.
8531500	8535740	And I think what ties into some of what you said, too, is that keep in mind that Dark
8535740	8540540	Sakura and I both also represent marginalized communities in one way or another.
8540540	8543340	We've not been shy about that over the years of the show.
8543340	8545820	And to Loki's credit as well, because it's his show, too.
8545820	8550940	Even if he is our token, cis-het, white guy on the show, he knows when to listen.
8550940	8556380	For all this crap we give Loki about, he says a lot when it comes to Nintendo and how it's
8556380	8556780	run.
8557100	8559740	So the other thing is Loki knows when to listen.
8559740	8560300	Right, Loki?
8562140	8563980	That's actually the first step of allyship.
8565020	8566220	Absolutely.
8566220	8567100	Absolutely it is.
8567740	8569980	And the thing is, don't listen to reply.
8570860	8571900	Listen to absorb.
8572620	8573420	Don't.
8573420	8575340	And not everything.
8576060	8577820	It's taken me time to learn this, too.
8578380	8580300	Not everything needs to be tweeted.
8581180	8582940	Sometimes, just listen.
8583580	8584620	That's all you need to do.
8585180	8585500	Read.
8585500	8586000	Oh.
8586780	8588140	And I'll add this, too.
8588140	8590300	Sometimes not everything is about you.
8590300	8592300	That's, that's right, too.
8592300	8593100	Absolutely.
8593740	8595980	So I told that to somebody and he blocked me.
8597500	8601740	But as far as the politics is concerned, I'm not like, look, I do not want this to be one
8601740	8602540	of those.
8602540	8603980	This is a chill stream.
8603980	8606140	Therefore, we don't talk about politics.
8606140	8609100	Like, politics affects everybody.
8609100	8613980	And for many of the reasons we've outlined before on this program, I don't need to rehash
8613980	8615020	them right now.
8615020	8621260	My stance is, I want to find the balance of making sure we're still covering the topic
8621260	8627420	that people came here to discuss and interjecting as well an awareness of the world around us
8627420	8628700	that these games exist in.
8628700	8634220	So sometimes I just want to walk the line of finding that balance and making sure that
8634860	8643180	we are doing our best to educate, show the other perspectives, and not berate.
8643180	8649020	Although there are some things that need to be berated, last name Kotick, first name Bobby,
8649020	8651900	as an example, not the Bobby that's on this network.
8651900	8652860	You all know what I'm talking about.
8652860	8654780	There's more that needs to be done apart from beration.
8654780	8658060	So that's kind of my stance on it.
8658060	8661260	So just just know, like, sometimes if I'm like, Okay, let's move on.
8661260	8665900	It's only because I'm, I'm realizing that the politics talk has taken up a really, really
8665900	8666940	good chunk of the show.
8667500	8672540	And sometimes all you can do, and I talked about this, we talked about the game that
8672540	8673340	shall not be named.
8674380	8678780	Sometimes all you could do is put the information in front of somebody.
8679660	8681900	Watch how they use that information.
8682940	8686860	That will inform what your relationship may or may not look like moving forward,
8687500	8689820	how they treat receiving that information.
8690780	8691820	And it's as simple as that.
8694300	8694800	Good email.
8695580	8696700	Yes, very good email.
8697420	8703020	I'm going to go ahead and pull up the other email from YYR.
8704380	8704860	All right.
8704860	8706140	Oh, the font is so small.
8707740	8712060	Well, I mean, which is fine by me, I can read small font, but it's just all of a sudden
8712060	8713340	it was like, Oh, this is much smaller.
8713980	8714860	Hello, LR.
8714860	8719740	I was super happy to hear that After Burner Climax was chosen as last episode's ORL classic
8719740	8720700	game of the week.
8720700	8722460	I've put a lot of hours into that game.
8722460	8725500	It's one of my favorite Sega games of the Lindbergh era.
8725500	8727980	It's an action packed masterpiece in every respect.
8727980	8732460	And to see an almost arcade perfect port make its way to Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 seemed
8732460	8733580	like a surreal miracle.
8734220	8736540	The announcement of the port came out of nowhere.
8736540	8739580	You might be wondering just how did that happen anyway?
8739580	8740380	Well, I have a theory.
8741660	8744940	One of you mentioned the After Burner styled level in Bayonetta.
8744940	8745660	I think that was me.
8746540	8753180	Well, there was an article posted by Destructoid in October 2009, link below, sorry, about
8753180	8758380	an interview with Bayonetta creator Hideki Kamiya shortly after the game was released.
8758380	8762380	Kamiya was asked what Sega game he wanted to see next.
8763020	8767180	And out of all the millions of things he could have asked for, he instead humbly requested
8767180	8769100	a home version of After Burner Climax.
8769740	8772220	I remember seeing this article when it came out.
8772220	8775980	I'm not sure if OLR covered it, but I didn't have time to check.
8775980	8780060	But surely enough, six months later, boom, Kamiya got his wish and so did everyone else
8780140	8783980	looking for a thrilling fight combat game in the comfort of their homes.
8783980	8787900	There's only one thing in the arcade version that didn't make it home, the two-player
8787900	8789100	pair play mode.
8789100	8790860	Sadly, I've never been able to try it.
8790860	8794060	I wonder if there are any arcades left that have two working machines.
8794060	8795420	Yeah, I've only seen a single machine.
8796700	8801100	One thing I absolutely must mention regarding this game is that I was engaged in hardcore
8801100	8806700	head-to-head combat with fellow longtime listener SSJ100 Matt on Xbox 360, on the Xbox 360
8806700	8807260	version.
8807260	8810140	We went back and forth for, what, a whole year, maybe more?
8810140	8814940	Each of us topped the other's previous best score more than a handful of times until finally
8814940	8823980	Matt achieved his current best of 1,631,770, number 121 overall on the leaderboard out
8823980	8832540	of almost 59,000 players, besting my 185th place personal record by about 140K.
8833500	8837180	I've always intended to go back and put in the work, but I'll be honest, it's been
8837180	8841020	over 10 years since then and I'm not sure my reflexes are still good enough to improve
8841020	8843100	any further, but that's a thing for another time.
8843740	8847340	And then, Jamie, I did not miss your mention of Deadstorm Pirates.
8847340	8849100	That is another one of my favorite games.
8849100	8854140	In fact, it's the very first video game I ever played with my wife, Amy, in the Times
8854140	8855740	Square Dave and Busters.
8855740	8861260	I still have my PS3 hooked up and my two Guncon 3s handy whenever we need to go back to it,
8861260	8863900	and my four-year-old already enjoys watching us play it.
8863980	8868220	If for some reason you wanted to make Deadstorm a classic game of the week, I would absolutely
8868220	8870300	love the opportunity to produce the segment.
8870300	8870800	Hey, cool.
8871340	8874540	You just tell me how much time to fill and I will fill it.
8875420	8880860	Side note, I probably will record audio and send it to you if you do it.
8881580	8884780	So then you'll know what to fill.
8886300	8891180	Also going to say if we forecast that you're going to be out for a week in the future,
8891180	8893660	that might be a thing we can do for a guest segment.
8894860	8896140	I'll also end on this.
8896140	8901260	I did not miss the mention of the Game Grumps playing super multitasking on their stream.
8901260	8903340	Thank you very much as always for the kind words.
8903340	8908220	I will say that unfortunately, this alone did not create the sustained word of mouth
8908220	8910940	that would have been required for the game to actually become popular.
8910940	8915180	However, I did get enough money out of it to buy a brand new gaming computer and monitor
8915180	8916860	replace my 10-year-old Frankenrig.
8917740	8925580	So I can now play DDR at 120 FPS since the latest PC version supports that and I'm all
8925580	8929100	set for early access on Hades 2 whenever that happens.
8929100	8931260	Damn right I have my priorities straight.
8931260	8933740	Oh, there was one other awesome thing that came out of this.
8933740	8937180	I finally have double digit reviews on Steam.
8937180	8939420	So now I have an average rating.
8939420	8941580	Positive instead of nine user reviews.
8942700	8944540	That was up there for literally years.
8944540	8945040	Woohoo!
8945360	8948880	Sorry for the long email, although I guess I'm not that sorry.
8948880	8950320	Otherwise I wouldn't have sent it.
8950320	8950720	Oh well.
8950720	8954320	Thanks again for the show and congrats on the big 950.
8954320	8955200	See you later.
8955200	8956080	Aaron Yyr.
8956640	8957520	Thanks Yyr.
8957520	8965680	And although I'm disappointed to hear that the moment in the spotlight of your game is
8965680	8969760	not sustaining, a new computer is a pretty nice tip.
8969760	8974480	So I'm glad at least you're getting something that you can spoil yourself with out of that
8974480	8979520	because you've done so many fun things and poured your heart into these projects between
8979520	8983120	Bungie ferret tossing and super multitasking and so forth.
8983120	8987360	I'm really glad that now you at least can get something tangible out of it.
8987360	8993200	So while I still wish your game would get the visibility on a mass scale that it deserves,
8994160	8995760	I'm really glad at least you got a moment.
8996960	9000080	To quote my spouse, it beats a sharp stick in the eye.
9000080	9001520	It does beat a sharp stick in the eye.
9001520	9002160	And you know what?
9002160	9002880	That's true.
9002880	9008000	Sometimes, and believe me, I know this from doing a podcast for 21 years.
9008000	9009200	My co-host will probably agree.
9009760	9013120	Sometimes you don't want to be in the spotlight.
9013120	9019440	Sometimes being at that, I'm getting a new computer that maybe that's an okay level to
9019440	9019760	be at.
9021920	9022320	All right.
9022880	9024400	I could use a little bit more spotlight.
9024960	9029120	Well, you might have one coming, so we'll see.
9029120	9029600	We'll see.
9030640	9030960	All right.
9031840	9035280	It's hard to be enthusiastic like about that kind of stuff.
9035280	9040000	Like, you know, kids are, you know, like I said, we've been doing this for like 21 years
9040000	9042240	and we're still in so much obscurity.
9042240	9043600	Go, okay, wait, what?
9043600	9051360	How do I, how do I find that that reply that you wrote to the Minecraft people with your
9051360	9051600	video?
9051600	9056640	Oh, you just, it was just hashtag, what was it?
9056640	9062640	It's hashtag feature me Minecraft is all in word.
9062640	9063360	Okay, hold on.
9063360	9067200	Cause I'm going to, I'm going to forget because we got to, we got to find the way to help
9067200	9068480	help Loki out right now.
9068480	9068720	Okay.
9068720	9069760	So feature me Minecraft.
9069760	9071840	Well, some people have some pretty interesting things here.
9071840	9072080	Okay.
9072080	9073760	Oh, look, look, fourth window.
9073760	9074880	Oh my gosh.
9074880	9077360	Look at this is such a good screenshot that you have here.
9077360	9082320	And for the podcast listeners, it's one of the fish from the bubble man stage in, in
9084320	9085040	is that the name of it?
9085040	9085840	I never knew the name.
9085840	9086240	Yeah.
9086960	9088400	Recreated in Minecraft.
9088400	9089600	These are so cool.
9089600	9095920	And in 3d it's, it's hard because Anko had literally three illustrations of it.
9095920	9096480	That is it.
9096480	9098720	That is all that exists and same with Octoper.
9098720	9101520	So here's what I'm going to do to help Loki out to get noticed.
9101520	9105600	I'm going to make sure I like that post most importantly, and then I'm going to reply to
9105600	9109120	it and I'm going to put, this is so cool.
9109120	9111120	I hope they pick you.
9111520	9116880	And then I'm going to retweet it and look at that.
9116880	9118480	I'm helping with visibility.
9118480	9120240	So I appreciate that.
9120240	9125120	If everybody goes in there and does something similar, I mean, don't make it obvious.
9125120	9129600	You were told to do so, but just like a retweet, it's going to help Loki out big time.
9129600	9132640	If even just like five people listening tonight did that, it would be helpful.
9132640	9134240	So awesome.
9135680	9136400	Good luck to you.
9137600	9137840	All right.
9137840	9138400	What?
9139040	9142320	I just, uh, Bobby.
9142320	9143440	What, uh, what did he say?
9144880	9148960	Well, like how Rob doesn't use the arrows between the four images and encloses the real
9151120	9153920	look, that's how often I use Twitter anymore.
9153920	9154880	That's for sure.
9154880	9156240	Hey, even, wow.
9156240	9156640	Wow.
9156640	9163040	Loki, this, this alone should be worth the hours upon hours of effort you put into this.
9163120	9167680	Shad Leland or Shane is in chat saying that stuff was top notch.
9167680	9168640	No joke.
9168640	9170480	Shane isn't impressed by anything.
9170480	9172480	Isn't like, you know, Pokemon.
9172480	9175600	So that's quite the compliment.
9175600	9183360	That one build, the Octopus, the Octoper, um, took like, it was like 80 hours or so to
9183360	9187680	put together and it's, it's 300,000 blocks.
9188480	9190720	That's my starter base, that one right there, the met.
9190720	9191840	So that, that's always fun.
9192560	9194800	Yeah, but that one right there and they're all functional too.
9194800	9198080	So like that right there is a guardian or a guardian farm.
9198080	9204880	So underneath there's a, um, a guardian temple and they go inside there and then they end
9204880	9210640	up in an XP farm and then the Octoper is actually covering up a stacking raid farm.
9210640	9212480	So it's all functional stuff.
9212480	9213920	Um, and it's huge.
9213920	9220560	Like even just building in my base, I am now like, I see that Octopus out just on the ocean,
9220560	9221440	like out there.
9221440	9223040	It's, it's enormous.
9223040	9224960	My base is going to be enormous.
9225680	9227040	It already is enormous.
9227040	9231360	And each, each section of the base I do is like a size of another mega base.
9231360	9233120	It's like ridiculous.
9233120	9234800	Well, and, and Shane and anyone listed.
9234800	9238400	So Shane actually further went on to say it honestly looks better than the official Mega
9238400	9239840	Man X pack they just put out.
9239840	9243760	Well, keep in mind, Loki gives tours of all of these in his videos.
9243760	9246720	So if you aren't, you know, for those that have no idea, cause they're listening on the
9246720	9247920	podcast feed, which is great.
9247920	9248800	We love you too.
9249120	9254080	Loki's Twitter to retweet and all that is over at Loki O L R all one word, uh, on Twitter.
9254080	9256720	And then, uh, of course his YouTube channel is same thing, right?
9256720	9257920	Or is there an underscore on YouTube?
9257920	9261440	It's well, YouTube has that wonderful at thing now.
9261440	9265200	So you can just do youtube.com slash at Loki O L R.
9265200	9266000	Perfect.
9266000	9269680	So, and then, uh, make sure you can actually watch those videos.
9269680	9271840	So fabulous.
9271840	9273520	Just past 800 subs.
9273520	9276160	So slowly making it there.
9276160	9277520	And subs are free.
9277520	9278960	They're like follows on Twitch.
9278960	9281760	That's the free cause sub on Twitch means money.
9281760	9282640	But yeah.
9283920	9284240	Wow.
9284240	9286160	I think you, you know what?
9286160	9291600	You have more follows on YouTube than I think dark Sakura or I or VOG network have on Twitch.
9291600	9294560	So maybe you shouldn't be complaining.
9295600	9296720	I'm getting there.
9296720	9297680	Yeah, no, you are.
9297680	9298320	You are.
9298320	9302080	Um, uh, I think fog and network is sadly in last place.
9302080	9304320	We need to, we need to up the visibility here.
9304320	9308320	It's not a contest, but, uh, we need to up the visibility here at VOG network because
9308320	9310320	when one of us wins, we all win.
9310960	9312320	That's the power of network.
9312320	9315520	By the way, we need to have a power meeting.
9317520	9317840	Okay.
9319040	9320800	Soon, but not tonight.
9320800	9321120	All right.
9322400	9322720	All right.
9323600	9325040	Uh, I think with that, we're done.
9325040	9328560	I didn't see anybody join the green room, so that is it.
9328560	9331040	Plus we're running a little long anyway, so I want to make sure we wrap up.
9331040	9334560	I already told you I'm starting to fade as the night goes on and I get to go back to
9334560	9335120	work tomorrow.
9335120	9335680	Woo.
9335680	9336880	At least I work at home.
9336880	9340160	I get to message the queen of chaos.
9340160	9345040	I get to read 5,000 emails when I get back to work tomorrow.
9345040	9348560	So let's go around and get final thoughts and say our good nights and all that good
9348560	9348880	stuff.
9348880	9350720	Um, dark Sakura, of course, I'll start with you.
9350720	9353600	I know you're going to go do some dead by daylight after the show tonight.
9353600	9356160	Um, do you have a final thought for our listeners tonight?
9357120	9361920	Um, you know how everyone, how people call dead by daylight, Debbie delight.
9363120	9369040	I was watching some scenes from singles the other day and there's the character Debbie
9369680	9373120	and all of a sudden my brain went to come to where the action is.
9373680	9374960	Come to Debbie town.
9376720	9379200	And you'd have to see that movie to get it.
9379200	9382080	But well, stay tuned for some Debbie town after the show.
9382880	9383360	Yep.
9383360	9384160	Later taters.
9384160	9384800	All right.
9384800	9385280	Bye bye.
9385840	9387200	I forgot my usual spiel.
9387200	9389840	If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Lodge Radio, tell a friend or two about the
9389840	9390240	show.
9390240	9392960	Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we
9392960	9395120	need more voices to put out on air.
9395120	9400080	A nice five star review on a site like iTunes or Spotify, wherever it is you found this
9400080	9402400	show, those go an awful long way.
9402400	9405040	A like and a retweet go an awful long way.
9405040	9405680	That's for sure.
9406480	9408000	Loki, your final thought for tonight?
9408880	9411600	I'm just going to be working more on content creation.
9411600	9418400	Still want to try to get back down to weekly videos, but it's just I do too.
9418400	9419760	I overscope everything.
9419760	9420880	You know, it's a problem.
9422080	9425600	But at the same time, those Mega Man things.
9425600	9427120	God damn, that's so impressive.
9427120	9428880	So yeah, although yes, I agree.
9428880	9431440	And you do need to lower your scope.
9431440	9434240	Damn, sometimes when you do it, it's like, okay, wow.
9434240	9435120	Yeah, I mean, it's
9435120	9436400	I can't help myself.
9436400	9437920	I have to keep doing that.
9437920	9440400	Think about the advice I gave Square Enix earlier.
9441120	9443760	Do the low hanging fruit to give that platform.
9443760	9444720	I know.
9444720	9446400	I just need to pace myself.
9447520	9448020	Yes, you do.
9449200	9449520	All right.
9450080	9454880	My final thought is I'll be back to doing some streaming this week as well over my personal
9454880	9455920	channel, Rob Roberts.
9455920	9460640	I will be doing some theater rhythm a couple days this week, and I'll be doing No Man's
9460640	9462720	Sky on Tuesday, Thursday.
9463280	9467760	Of course, again, Star Trek Cruise wrap up here at VOG Network.
9467760	9468480	So check that out.
9468560	9472240	If nothing else, even if you could give a shit about Star Trek or the Cruise, come watch
9472240	9474480	me get yelled at for playing Overwatch badly.
9474480	9477760	I'm subjecting myself to that for y'all's entertainment.
9477760	9478560	That's going to do it.
9479440	9486480	Thanks so much for being here for our 950th episode, 50 more until we hit 1000 weekly
9486480	9487120	podcasts.
9487120	9492000	And not a lot of internet shows have hit 1000 weekly episodes.
9492000	9496560	I know some other like gaming and other shows, they've hit 1000 episodes for maybe multiples
9496560	9497440	a week and so forth.
9498080	9502640	Not a lot on any topic, really, that have made the 1000 weekly episodes club.
9502640	9509360	So thank you all for making that a distinct reality for our show as we move in to the
9509360	9511840	next year and beyond.
9512400	9513360	Have a good week, everybody.
9513360	9516320	We'll see you next time here on Orange Lounge Radio.
9516320	9516800	Good night.
9518160	9520640	You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
