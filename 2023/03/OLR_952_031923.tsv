0	13800	Can it be the year of Silent Hill? I'd really like it to be. Akira Yamaoka is back
13800	18140	with the series, a new movie, a remake, an interactive media experience and two new games
18140	22280	in the works? If it all goes bust, break out your PS2s, your PS4 that gives you anxiety
22280	25320	because it still has PT on it and any other version of the series you liked because the
25320	29400	second hand market is good. While we party like it's 1999, now it's time for your
29400	32680	hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers and Loki to tell you about one of these things and
32680	35760	the rest of the week's gaming news starting right now on the show where every gamer has
35760	36760	a voice.
36760	45240	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show
45240	51880	where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are live once again with
51880	59920	the 952nd episode of our show for tonight, March the 19th of 2023. I hope those of you
59920	64520	that celebrated or did whatever for St. Patrick's Day had a good time. Everyone else, I hope
64520	68120	you had a good weekend and here we are on Sunday night to wrap it all up and put a little
68120	72640	bow on our gaming weeks and our gaming weekends and everything that's been going on in the
72640	77560	gaming industry. I am Rob Roberts and I am joined as always by the one and only Dark
77560	85160	Sakura or Jamie Summers up. Hi, how are you doing? I'm all right. I am. I'm a little sore
85160	91400	today because I have been got the I got the okay to get back into doing workouts. And
91400	98600	I started back on my hip workouts to strengthen my hip back up. I've said before I've got
98600	103640	premature arthritis in my right hip and just trying to build the muscle around it and stay
103640	110940	in good shape and prep for a potential Disneyland trip for my birthday. I'll be fine. So if
110940	114680	you're working out does this mean how long until we get a flex redeem on Dark Sakura's
114680	121840	O.L.R.? Oh, a free one on the house here at Vogue Network, where we do tape live every
121840	126360	Sunday night at nine o'clock Eastern, six o'clock Pacific right after the Bobby Black
126360	130580	Wolf show. And if you want to see some of the gun show, we try to keep it minimal on
130580	136340	the visual antics because it is a podcast. It's been a podcast for 21 years about give
136340	141980	or take. And so we try to keep the visuals minimum. But who am I to say no to a free
141980	149140	flex redeem for Dark Sakura O.L.R.? I actually am considering putting up my own flex redeem
149140	157820	soon. Once I'm back to where I was lifting before, it's slow going. I stopped for about
157820	164240	seven months while I was so sick. So I've had to downgrade my weights instead of starting
164240	169820	off with 15s. I'm starting off well, I mean, technically I have a little bar on there,
169820	175080	so I'm actually starting off with 10 and then going to work myself back up to my 15s. And
175080	181980	I'm still using my kettlebell at 35. So eventually I'll have to buy a 55 pound kettlebell. So
181980	186740	all right. Well, I'm not sure how much he's working out, but let's say hello anyway to
186740	196500	Techmaster Loki. I'm not working out at all right now. Can we get a flex redeem? Denied.
196500	202860	How are you doing, Loki? I'm doing OK. Yeah. Yeah. Anything new and exciting in your world?
202860	208860	No. No. Yeah. Mood. I hear you. It's been it's been a week. It's been nothing but rainy
208860	213860	and stormy this week. It sort of means no going out and doing anything fun. It's just
213860	217340	staying in and playing video games. But that's fun, too. Speaking of video games, what is
217340	221620	outside and done stuff? Did you? I didn't. I hardly went outside and did anything. I
221620	227260	went I replanted six plants over the last couple of days because they were getting strangled
227260	232200	in their teensy little pots. Actually, I will say yesterday it was more overcast. So I was
232200	237580	able to go out and do like not to get in my gaming weeks too much, but oops, do like Pokemon
237580	242180	Community Day in Pokemon Go because they had a community day yesterday and then Pikmin,
242180	246500	all the Niantic games had a community day the same day because who coordinates things over
246500	252580	there? I don't know. Coordinate? I can't be bothered to do one office talking to the other.
252580	260100	We can't do that. So yeah, so I did get out Saturday, but that was really it. I got in like
260100	265300	12,000 steps yesterday. So I guess I could guess I could do a little bit. Really, Mike Defton in
265300	270980	our chat because as we tape live, y'all can chat along with us over twitch.tv slash vog network.
271780	278260	Deft says speaking of Pokemon Go Community Day for April is Togetic. Wouldn't that be Togope?
278820	282740	Wouldn't the baby form spawn or are they actually going to form Togetic everywhere?
282740	283780	Is this the upgrade?
284420	288180	Yeah, I was gonna say Togetic is the mid form. So that would be weird if it's not
288180	292420	Togope's. I would expect would be the interesting. Mike Deft says no, it's Togetic.
293220	297380	Interesting. Huh. I wonder why they're doing it that way. I wonder,
297620	301460	oh, Deft says baby forms are not usually found in the wild. Well, for some of the other three,
301460	308180	I mean, if you consider Bulbasaur a baby form or a lot of the other three evolution, right?
308820	313380	Most of the time we do see the base evolution in the wild. So it is a little weird. I think
313380	316980	there's gonna be a lot of people to find that weird, but I'm gonna best...
316980	319700	If you're looking for baby animals in the wild,
319700	321780	you need to make sure that you leave them with your mother.
322660	326740	Yes. Well, I'm gonna guess that for that community day,
326740	332020	they do two kilometer eggs and they do like half hatch distance and all of the eggs are
332020	337540	gonna have Togope. I bet that's what they do to kind of bridge that gap, so to speak.
338100	341620	May have to start playing again just so I can have 57,000 Togope.
342340	348020	Or be like Shane and get like 700 shiny ones for no reason than just you love shinies.
348740	357300	Well, Togope before Mimikyu was invented, Togope was my favorite and I actually have a very special
357300	361940	fond memory for Togope because I don't know, I've told the story about when I got held up
361940	366100	at gunpoint working at GNC, right? Yeah. You've mentioned before scary stuff. Yeah.
366100	371700	Well, Dan took me to Toys R Us to cheer me up and I found a $20 bill in the parking lot
372980	377700	and I used that $20 bill to buy myself a Togope plushie that I still have to this day.
377860	383220	It's sort of like my comfort plushie. Your little karma plushie in some ways.
384020	387780	That's not exactly how karma works. I know, but okay, you know what I mean.
388580	395220	Yeah, but it ended up being like my little comfort, like I kind of felt like
395220	400900	maybe the universe wasn't completely shit. You know, Toys R Us is like half back now.
401700	407700	They're mini stores inside Macy's. So like as I was walking around downtown yesterday,
407700	410980	which by the way was a hoot and a holler here in Sacramento where we're all based,
411620	415940	the NCAA championships were going on at the Golden One Center, or I don't know if it's
415940	420580	championships or qualifier, whatever, but the Sacramento Arena was like a site for that.
420580	424660	So I don't know sports well enough to tell you what game it was, but I just know there were a
424660	428100	fuck ton of people. And yes, that's an actual scientific measurement. There was a fuck ton of
428100	431860	people down there, but I was walking through that area anyway. And there's like that Macy's right
431860	436180	there. Right. And so you walk by the window and they actually have like a, it's a new style
436180	441380	drawing, but they have Jeffrey the giraffe and stuff in the window. Because if you go up to the
441380	445300	second floor, there's like a Toys R Us in the Macy's. So that's what it's like. You know how
445300	450660	there's like Sephora's inside JC Penney? It's like, they do. It's like that. Yeah. It's like
450660	459540	that. I miss the big warehouse. I know. I know, but I sadly think those days may be behind us.
459540	463540	So, but at least if you like the mascots, if you like, if you're a Jeffrey the giraffe fan,
463540	471060	at least there's that. So free ad for them. All right. Also, I actually have a Toys R Us bag from
471060	476180	when they went out of business. Oh, like they got like super cheap or something? Well, no, no. I
476180	480260	mean that like they gave me extra shopping bags, like the plastic bags. Oh, right. Right. Right.
480980	487300	Yeah. Little mementos. All right. Yeah. It was nice. Let's move on to giving free advertisements
487300	492820	for Nintendo because for our lead topic tonight, I want to talk a little bit about the Wii U and
492820	499620	the 3DS are having their stores close. Now, technically the closure date is March 27th.
499620	504100	So that's actually a week from Monday. Part of the reason I want to bring it up tonight though,
504100	509620	is that I would tell you is that if you want to wait until the very last second,
509620	514820	I think that's not a good decision because with time zones, with the way networks work,
514820	519620	with sometimes companies really eager to pull the plug, I would not expect that this is going
519620	525620	to work the entire length of the day, March 27th. So I really think this is the last week that those
525620	532100	shops are open. If you have any 3DS or Wii U purchases that you want to get. And boy,
532100	536820	some people want to make a lot of purchases. There's a YouTuber out there by the name,
536820	543140	The Completionist. And he's been around the gaming media this week because he actually spent
543140	554420	$22,791 getting every single digital title that's available on the Wii U and the 3DS. That's 866
554420	564260	Wii U games and 1,547 3DS games, adding up to 1.2 terabytes of Wii U space and 267 gigabytes
564260	569460	on the 3DS. Now, this isn't something he did all last night. This whole effort has taken about a
569460	574580	year. I will defer to our pal, Bobby Blackwolf, who really went into the weeds tonight on his
574580	581460	show about like what the banking restrictions are and what the prepaid cards are. And like,
581460	586420	so all these roadblocks that stopped him and his team. It actually wasn't just him. It was
586420	591060	his whole team from actually buying every game in one day. So my point is, if you're trying to do
591060	596980	what The Completionist did tomorrow, it's too late. The restrictions that are in place with
596980	602260	how much money you can drop before you're triggering security measures, it's too much.
602260	608980	But if there are a few pieces of low hanging fruit, so to speak, or things that you can't get
608980	612900	physically or whatever that you want to get, you know, this is the week to really think about it
612900	616500	if you have either of those systems still connected. And I imagine more of you probably
616500	624340	still have access to a 3DS pretty readily than you might the Wii U. Some suggestions to throw out
624340	630100	there if you are looking for things on the 3DS, I would highly suggest go back and look at the 3D
630100	637300	Classics catalog. Nintendo and Sega both did a round of some 3D classics, and they're very
637380	643460	well done for what they are. I know Nintendo had a Kid Icarus one in there. They had some other
643460	648020	games too. I don't remember if they had a Metroid. Excitebike, I think, was one of the other games
648020	651060	that they did for 3DS. There were some others too. I'll look and chat in a minute here because
651060	656820	you probably shout them out. But Sega did quite a few. They had Gunstar Heroes in the catalog,
656820	662180	Sonic, several Sonic games. They had a lot lot in the catalog, and I would recommend those. I think
662180	668660	it's actually a missed opportunity that those haven't been re-released, yes, in 2D form on the
668660	674820	Switch. Especially in the case of the Nintendo ones. They souped up the classics without going
674820	680100	in and doing a complete overhaul and calling them pixel remasters or whatever. They seemed
680100	686260	pretty simple, so to speak, at the end of the day. Those would be some things I would recommend.
686260	692020	I'm curious in chat, what would you all recommend for the Wii U and the 3DS for titles to go
692500	697460	before they go away? I know, again, during Bobby's show, one suggestion that came up that I thought
697460	703700	was really good would be the Pokemon Bank. If you want to be able to transfer, you will be able to
703700	708260	re-download titles that you've downloaded in the past. Lord knows how much longer you'll be able
708260	714180	to do that though. That won't be forever. But you can download things like Pokemon Bank and have
714180	721540	that available to transfer 3DS Pokemon and DS Pokemon into a bank, which then you can transfer
721620	727940	into home. That's how you get your Pokemon into modern games. And with that, I would say the 3DS
727940	734020	re-release of things like Pokemon Yellow that actually had the Pokemon Transporter built into
734020	739780	the old ROMs, which is pretty cool. So you can go catch an old Pikachu from a Game Boy game
739780	745140	and transfer it all the way to Pokemon Scarlet. You could do that now. But you have to have all
745140	751060	the systems set in place to be able to do that. Fixation Gaze in chat says, I recommend the
751140	756100	Phoenix Wright series. It's the best on the 3DS. Yes. Now, I should also say there are
756100	761780	quite a few 3DS and Wii U games that are getting remastered on Switch. We have seen a lot of those
761780	767060	come back. I think with Phoenix Wright, we're more seeing newer titles. I know there's been a
767060	772980	new one announced in that series. So keep an eye out for those. But yeah, certainly the classics,
772980	778820	for sure. Dark Tetsuya suggests NES Remix. That is a great concept too. I'm surprised Nintendo has
778820	784900	never revisited or re-released that title in any form. There were versions on the 3DS and the Wii
784900	789860	U, if I remember right. I want to say the Wii U had a volume one and a volume two, and the 3DS
789860	795620	had a retail release that was like a mishmash of both, like a best of from both. I would highly
795620	801860	recommend those. SheHulk10 suggests Xenoblade X Chronicles only on Wii U. That's a really good
801860	807060	one. Absolutely. That's a Xenoblade game they haven't brought on the Switch yet. I think they're
807060	813460	saving it for the Switch's successor. But maybe that's just wishful thinking. Mike Devton chat
813460	821140	suggests Rhythm Heaven Megamix for all my rhythm game enthusiasts. Bonds006 suggests Fire Emblem.
821140	828580	I believe didn't the original Fire Emblem come out as a standalone on Switch eShop? I want to say
828580	831620	that was the thing they announced during one of the directs because they did like a really expensive
831700	836660	physical release for some reason of that too. I know there were certain
838260	843140	games in the series that are there too, so certainly worth looking at as well.
843140	848500	Mike Dev suggests Kirby's Adventure 3D. That was the definitive version of playing that game.
848500	855300	sg100map backs up that the 3D classics are great. Gunstar Heroes, Streets of Rage, and Outrun to
855300	860340	name a few. That's right. Outrun in the 3DS classics is really good. Really, really good.
860340	867460	The thing is with a lot of those games though is I already have a bunch of them elsewhere.
868500	874980	That would be for me my reason for not going after some of these. It's cool to have them
874980	884980	on the console, but it's also extra money. Yeah, it is. I think what made the 3D versions
884980	888900	unique would be, well, the 3D, you're not really going to get that a lot of other places. But they
888900	892660	did. I don't remember the Sega classics particularly. Chat, you might have to back me
892660	897060	up, but I know the Nintendo ones, they actually did enhance the original ROMs a little bit.
897060	901220	Now, of course, if you want your experience pure, then this is actually going to be a turn
901220	905780	off for you and not a reason to get it. For me, I thought it was a nice little fresh coat of paint
905780	910580	on the old games. I liked what they did with that. I thought that was really cool. sg100map says,
910580	916580	we'll likely not see anything 3D like this again. Don't see Nintendo revisiting 3D again. I agree
916580	922980	with that. Remember 3D televisions? Those kind of came and went, didn't they? They barely do 3D
922980	928900	movies anymore. I know they exist, but I feel like now it's 4D. Have you heard about this whole
928900	935540	thing? People going to see Scream 6, and when people get killed, it splashes water to simulate
935540	940740	blood. It's 4D stuff that they're doing now. 4D. The fourth dimension is time.
941860	945860	Well, you know, that's what they call it. Hey, go back and watch Hypercube. It was a
945940	953300	good movie. I didn't get my chance on the Star Trek Cruise. I'm very disappointed because Nicole
953300	958580	DeBauer was there, and I wanted to say, I loved you in Cube, but I didn't get my chance because
959460	973620	she also was the other Jax in season seven. But yeah, Jazita. I always butcher the names. Anyway,
974180	979540	uh, Fixation Gaze says, I will say Universal was doing 4D way long ago in their parks for
979540	984820	the Shrek rides. Yeah. So that's where, that's where the whole 4D phenomenon came from.
984820	991380	But yeah. Oh, Tiger Claw says Super Mario movie will be in 3D. I know they still do 3D movies,
991380	997700	but I feel like that's the theaters kind of shoehorning the technology that they paid all
997700	1001300	this money to implement and they're like refusing to walk away from it until they have to.
1001940	1007540	Uh, I feel like it's not pushed as much as it used to be when like Avatar was new. I mean,
1007540	1013380	the original Avatar was new, you know, that sort of thing. So, you know, my, my thing with,
1013380	1017780	with 3D and cinema is that it needs to be there to enhance the movie and not a gimmick.
1018580	1023540	Yeah. Yeah. And it's the same with, with, you know, if they bring back like that whole
1023540	1030180	lenticular thing that the 3DS had or any other sort of, of 3D technology, it needs to be an
1030180	1036900	enhancement and not a gimmick. Uh, dark to see us speaking of probably the most gimmicky 3D,
1036900	1042580	or if I say 4D experience I've ever seen, the 3D I miss is like they did for Honey,
1042580	1046580	I Shrunk the Audience. I don't know if they do that for movies anymore.
1046580	1051860	Do not mess with that because it was Rick Moranis and Eric Idle.
1053460	1059380	But remember, remember Honey I Shrunk the Audience was, was a thing, but I would say the
1059380	1065860	first 4D was Captain EO before that, remember this Captain EO before that, that was the first 4D.
1067140	1072580	I wish I had gone to the original Captain EO. I kind of am sad that I missed it, but I did like
1072580	1080820	the revival, but it, I'm sorry, Captain EO is, is pinnacle, pinnacle.
1080820	1083620	Yeah. It's, it's one of those things where it's like, I, I, I actually-
1083620	1085860	Angelica Houston being a goddess. Hello.
1085860	1091060	I still kind of believe Captain EO needs a place in Disney park somewhere. I understand they give
1091060	1095060	it a lot of real estate, but I feel like Captain EO, they should do at least one showing a day.
1095060	1101940	Like there's always like so many of us of a certain age, you know, despite however you feel
1101940	1107940	about Michael Jackson at this point and everything, the thing is Captain EO is like-
1107940	1108420	Amazing.
1109220	1109940	It's childhood.
1109940	1110980	Staple and icon.
1110980	1112660	A staple, exactly.
1112660	1113300	It's unique.
1113860	1115140	It is unique.
1115140	1115620	And thankfully-
1115620	1118180	It's going to change the world. We are going to change the world.
1118980	1123460	Some people, by the way, have gone in and done sort of their own remaster of it,
1123460	1127860	where they combine the 3D elements into a single, you know, 2D experience,
1127860	1129220	and the whole thing is up on YouTube.
1129860	1132180	Oh yeah. I'm, I'm, that one's, I'm pretty sure-
1132180	1133940	I go back and watch it at least once a month.
1134660	1137700	I'm pretty sure Honey I Shrunk the Audience is all on YouTube as well at this point,
1137700	1140260	you know, fan cams basically, but it's there.
1140260	1144660	I have two things that I go back and watch at least once a month, three, sorry, three.
1144660	1146100	One of them is Captain EO.
1146100	1150660	The other one is Interstellar 5555.
1151620	1153380	And the other one is the Princess Bride.
1154340	1155220	Inconceivable.
1156740	1158100	You keep saying that word.
1158100	1159220	Do you even know what it means?
1160180	1161940	No, I do not think it means what you think it means.
1164260	1167620	Back to the topic we were talking about, Wii U and 3DS.
1167620	1168900	So the stores are closing.
1168900	1171940	I'm curious for my co-hosts, is there anything you're going to miss?
1171940	1174820	Or are you just kind of like, let it, let, let it die.
1175860	1176580	Let it die.
1178100	1182420	For me, I mean, this is one of those things that seems inevitable in this day and age,
1182420	1187620	but obviously there is hurt feelings because for game preservation,
1187620	1191140	this stinks because there were so many digital only titles.
1191140	1198100	And what we see Nintendo doing is not what we see Microsoft or even to some extent Sony doing,
1198100	1203060	which is having that digital catalog be available when you buy a new system,
1203060	1205140	thanks to backwards compatibility.
1205140	1210180	You know, I think we can all cross our fingers and hope and pray thoughts, prayers, rainbows,
1210180	1214820	wishes, whatever you want to, that there's going to be something on the future Nintendo
1214820	1220020	console, but I'm not going to hold my breath with that whole thing.
1221460	1226500	And so that's the part that's kind of sad is that these games will essentially be lost to time.
1226500	1232340	Although with preservationist efforts, like what, you know, this YouTuber did in
1232340	1234100	downloading the entire archive.
1234100	1243140	And let's be real, the ethical question of is piracy and emulation an ethical thing to do?
1243140	1248660	That argument changes significantly once the stores are closed and literally your ability
1248660	1251780	to buy these games and pay money for them goes away.
1251780	1253860	And I'll let you fill in the gaps with what I'm saying.
1254820	1256340	But it's, oh, go ahead.
1257060	1260900	I was going to say if things lately have taught me anything,
1260900	1263060	it's that ethics are subjective these days.
1264020	1264520	True.
1266980	1269860	And I would just say like, if I'm going to play these games,
1269860	1273300	I do not feel bad about emulating them after March 27th.
1274020	1281060	Well, and the thing about it to also add is that the intent and the impact are two different
1281060	1281560	things.
1282180	1289780	And if the overall, if the intent is good and the impact comes out positively, then yeah, great.
1289780	1296820	But you can always have good intent and have the end result come out pretty shitty.
1298020	1300820	And of course, as far as what that end result is going to be,
1300820	1303780	that is going to be another subjective thing.
1303780	1307380	Nintendo might see it one way, we as the public will see it another.
1307380	1311940	What's going to be the prevailing thought?
1311940	1312440	Okay.
1313460	1316660	Fixation Gays in Chat says, once you cannot buy it legitimately,
1316660	1318260	it's out the window, honestly.
1318260	1319460	Yeah, I agree with that.
1320020	1320900	That's my theory.
1320900	1322020	I agree with that.
1322020	1330340	But I mean, again, we're looking at honestly, I think that if they're going to take it off
1330340	1334820	of the market, they know there's going to be a quote, black market.
1335620	1339860	Some people, and to be fair, some people, and they have a right to this opinion,
1339860	1344980	say that no, you're still not in an ethically good place by doing that.
1344980	1349380	Because this is similar to how Disney used to vault, I'll come back to the minute,
1349380	1351060	used to vault their old movies.
1351060	1351540	Remember that?
1351540	1356100	You had to buy that movie on VHS in the little clamshell case, and it would go back into
1356100	1358980	the Disney vault as of whatever date.
1358980	1363540	You can never buy it again, or they'd be up to collectors sky high.
1363620	1368420	But, important footnote, Disney came around eventually.
1368420	1371620	Once the technology was in place, guess what Disney Plus offers?
1372420	1373380	There's no more vault.
1373380	1378180	You can watch everything on Disney Plus, except for the controversial ones, you know,
1378180	1380660	the things that Disney is not going to put out, period.
1380660	1386740	They think should be released as a teaching element.
1386740	1392180	Yeah, because if I didn't say that, someone would, but otherwise, for the most part,
1392580	1397300	those titles are open and available on Disney Plus as far as things like The Little Mermaid
1397300	1400020	to Snow White to Treasure Planet and whatever.
1401460	1403700	They're all available on Disney Plus at this point.
1403700	1405460	So finally, they came around eventually.
1405460	1410100	And the reason why I say that is because maybe someday, Nintendo does the same thing.
1410100	1410580	Maybe.
1410580	1411940	Maybe Disney shows that as well.
1412580	1416420	DGRMS says, I have a bunch of those clamshell VHS Disney movies.
1416420	1420260	Those clamshells are icons of the 80s and 90s, as far as I'm concerned.
1420980	1422500	Those are icons of the 80s.
1422500	1423220	So you know what?
1423220	1426340	They're still collector values and things like that.
1426340	1431220	So I wish that I had still had my copy of Peach Dragon.
1431220	1435300	I mean, it's since come out on DVD, but for the longest time, the only way you could get
1435300	1437300	that was on VHS.
1437300	1439780	And I loved that movie as a kid.
1439780	1440740	I love Helen Reddy.
1440740	1442660	That was the movie that made me love Helen Reddy.
1443940	1444820	All right.
1444820	1449620	Well, while we reminisce, let's take a moment and reminisce our past week as we talk about
1449620	1453140	our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing this week.
1453140	1454980	So Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?
1456260	1457140	Pretty eventful.
1460660	1464180	Of course, I played a lot of Dead by Daylight, and I played it with Fixy.
1464180	1464900	Hi, Fixy.
1467220	1468420	And Gwen and Shayla.
1469060	1471780	You have a little squad now I always see you playing with.
1471780	1474500	We call ourselves Team Yeet.
1474500	1475060	Team Yeet.
1475060	1476580	Yeah, I lurk.
1476580	1477060	I lurk.
1477620	1479060	You don't know I'm there, but I'm there.
1479620	1486020	And there is a video on YouTube of the origin day of Team Yeet and a farming ghost face.
1488900	1491060	But yeah, we do our thing.
1492340	1495860	I actually adapted Sadako on Sunday.
1496900	1502180	And I don't know if it was because I remembered all of my skills very suddenly or I had a
1502180	1503220	bunch of flops.
1503220	1508580	It was probably a combination of both, but I got my Sadako adapt without really trying.
1509620	1516260	That's five out of how many killers now I still need to regain my...
1516260	1517860	I've got all the survivors adapted.
1519300	1522260	I played a lot of Marvel Midnight Suns.
1522260	1527860	I played it on stream last night because I learned that my controller is incompatible
1527860	1529140	with my SNES emulator.
1530820	1534660	I have actually ordered a controller specifically for my SNES emulator.
1535620	1540180	And again, I can legally play these games on stream because I own the original Super
1540180	1541460	Famicom cartridges.
1541460	1541860	The end.
1542500	1544100	So yeah, Letterman jackets.
1544100	1545460	We're going to do Letterman jackets.
1548260	1549380	Ranja, I don't remember.
1549380	1554180	I'll tell you offline for what controller I ordered.
1554740	1558260	But at any rate, I also played a bunch of pinball.
1558260	1563540	And I got into a very fun discussion about pinball with the one and only Brianna Wu.
1564660	1568980	We're online friends now.
1570020	1572820	And I am hoping that I actually get to play pinball with her.
1572820	1574340	I think that would be absolutely fun.
1574900	1576260	She's got quite the collection.
1576260	1577380	I was very impressed.
1577380	1578900	Isn't she on the other coast?
1578900	1581460	Didn't she run for office out in Maryland or something?
1582180	1583540	Well, I mean, things happen.
1583540	1588740	I mean, if there's a convention or anything, I'm still planning on going out that way.
1589700	1593620	Paxis is this weekend, speaking of that part of the country.
1593620	1597380	I know, but it just reminded me, Paxis is this weekend.
1598100	1603540	But we talked pinball, and I really want to play the Halloween pinball.
1603540	1604500	And she's got one.
1605140	1605860	I want to play it.
1606820	1610420	But I've been playing a lot of Beatles Mania and World Cup Soccer, because World Cup Soccer
1610420	1611060	is my favorite.
1613220	1617140	I also have been playing my stupid word game.
1618100	1624260	It's sad when I can solve one of the, quote, super hard puzzles in 20 seconds.
1625860	1628100	And what else did I do?
1628100	1635460	Oh, yeah, I played a little Jackie Crush, the last in the Crush series.
1635460	1636260	We had Alien Crush.
1636260	1637140	Oh, yeah.
1637140	1638260	You've highlighted that before.
1638260	1640500	I'm almost positive in the classic game segment.
1640500	1646500	Jackie Crush is the SNES one, which is the final entry in the Crush series of pinball
1646500	1646820	games.
1647540	1648580	I just like how it starts.
1648580	1650180	You have all the demon faces that scroll out.
1650180	1651460	It goes, Jackie Crush.
1653220	1655140	And what else did I play?
1655140	1658340	Because I played other stuff, and I don't remember.
1659780	1662340	Yeah, I think that that might be it.
1664580	1666260	Yeah, I can't remember what else.
1666260	1669060	I know that there was something else on my list, but I don't remember.
1669060	1669940	So fuck it.
1672100	1674100	I played a lot of Dead by Daylight.
1674820	1677940	All right, let's go over to Loki.
1677940	1679220	How is your gaming week?
1679220	1680420	It's just Minecraft.
1681220	1682740	Still working on my project.
1682740	1687940	I finally got to the part where I'm actually filming stuff and building in the SMP now.
1687940	1692900	So hoping to have an episode out very soon, because it's been a very long time.
1692900	1694420	What happened with the Minecraft contest?
1694420	1696100	Because wasn't that over on the 15th?
1696100	1698420	Yeah, the cutoff was on the 15th.
1698420	1699780	They haven't announced anything yet.
1699780	1700820	Oh, okay.
1700820	1702500	So they're just taking their time.
1703220	1703720	Fair.
1704820	1706420	So probably this week sometime.
1706420	1706740	All right.
1706740	1710020	Well, still crossing my fingers for you, even if it's just a shout out.
1710020	1712340	Hey, it's still an acknowledgement.
1712340	1713940	It's a senpai notice me moment.
1713940	1714900	So it's fine.
1715940	1717140	Anything else for your gaming week?
1717780	1718500	No, that's it.
1719380	1722420	I end up stuff on the Steam sale that I probably will buy and not play.
1723300	1725780	I keep forgetting that there was a Steam sale that just started.
1725780	1726740	Oh, that's dangerous.
1726740	1727540	All right.
1727540	1731220	Yeah, I keep seeing Final Fantasy VII integrate in there.
1731300	1734420	I was like, sure.
1735940	1737220	Maybe I've been watching Alan.
1737220	1740100	Alan's been doing some streaming of that on his channel.
1740100	1745940	And his whole thing now is he mods games and streams them with the mods.
1745940	1747940	And I suppose I should shout out my husband here.
1747940	1749860	He's going to do a stream on Tuesday.
1749860	1752660	So he's been playing Mass Effect 2 modded.
1753700	1757220	And sorry, Jamie, I think this conflicts with one of your streams, but Alan's been working
1757220	1757860	very hard on this.
1757860	1758500	I'm going to plug it.
1759140	1766020	He's going to beat Mass Effect 2 modded on Tuesday at 10 30 Eastern and do the ending
1766020	1766340	sequence.
1766340	1770740	But what's special about it, he's been modding it so that he can romance Thane because there's
1770740	1775380	actually dialogue, I guess, that is there that was not in the actual release.
1775380	1782100	So Thane was romanceable by a lady in Mass Effect 2, but not by a male character.
1782100	1785380	This mod has unlocked the male and Thane romance.
1785380	1789620	So he's going to show that on stream on Tuesday and beat the game, which, of course, what's
1789620	1789780	that?
1790420	1791220	It was dialogue?
1791220	1791700	Yeah.
1791700	1795540	Apparently there was dialogue like there was in the first game for a Kaiden male romance.
1796340	1798420	Something like that where there's ghost dialogue or something.
1798420	1801780	So yeah, like it was in there and then coded out.
1801780	1803060	Yep, exactly.
1803060	1806660	So thanks to modders.
1806660	1807140	It's back.
1807140	1808820	So that's something he's going to be doing on Tuesday.
1808820	1812500	And if there's just so many streams you want to watch and you can't choose, he'll be happy
1812500	1813460	if you watch the VOD.
1813460	1815140	So and that'll all be highlighted as well.
1815140	1817220	So there's that.
1817220	1818180	So let's see.
1818180	1820980	Otherwise, my gaming week, the types of games I've been playing, streaming, whatever it
1820980	1821140	is.
1821700	1823300	Theatrhythm continuing on with that.
1823300	1825460	The World Ends With You DLC came out this week.
1825460	1827220	I streamed a little bit of that earlier this week.
1827780	1828660	Really good music.
1828660	1830820	And I'm not super familiar with that series.
1830820	1833700	I have to admit, like, I'm familiar that it exists.
1833700	1835940	I just didn't really play them start to finish.
1835940	1837300	There's some really good songs in that.
1837300	1839380	There's some bangers in that game.
1839380	1842020	So I was really happy with the DLC for Theatrhythm.
1842020	1843300	I've been playing a little bit of that.
1843940	1847620	I also continuing just a little bit of Dead by Daylight, not as much as Dark Sakura, but
1847620	1850020	maybe a game a day or something like that.
1850020	1852660	Just to keep my skills up to speed.
1852660	1853780	I remembered my other game.
1853780	1854660	I played Among Us.
1855300	1856020	Oh, that's right.
1856020	1857220	You've been getting into that lately.
1858100	1861700	I've been playing with Raven McPherson, Arty, and all them.
1861700	1862740	Yeah, yeah.
1862740	1865220	So I didn't mean to cut you off, but I just remembered.
1865220	1868980	Mike Def says, glad they included with World Ends With You some of the songs in Neo.
1868980	1871540	Yeah, it's three from the original and three from Neo.
1871540	1873620	So it's some good round of DLC.
1873620	1874340	I enjoyed it.
1874340	1877220	Very much looking forward to the Nier DLC, which will be next week.
1877860	1879700	So definitely will play that as well.
1880580	1882900	I've also been playing No Man's Sky.
1882900	1886100	I'm really close to finishing the expedition if I hadn't.
1886100	1890100	So unfortunately, I fucked myself on stream.
1890100	1891220	Not in that kind of way.
1891220	1891860	Really?
1891860	1893140	I'm not talking about an OF.
1893140	1899220	I'm talking about when you get yourself into a logic problem live on stream and the logic
1899220	1906580	problem was in No Man's Sky, the logic problem was you can only craft material at your base
1906580	1908260	in this latest mission.
1908260	1912900	I landed on a planet and I landed and I was out of starship fuel.
1912900	1917540	I could not craft more starship fuel because I was nowhere near my base.
1918100	1921780	I would have had to have walked four hours on the planet to get to my base.
1922420	1929540	So what I had to do, I had to construct an all new base in order to build the starship
1929540	1931380	fuel so I could take off.
1931380	1935060	So Quest Buster says I'm a little halfway through that expedition.
1935060	1938580	So learn from Uncle Rob what not to do.
1938580	1941220	And here's how to get yourself out of those situations.
1941220	1946660	So Quest Buster, always keep the material on you to build one extra base.
1947300	1951460	And it's a lot of chromatic metal and a lot because they amped it up from what it normally
1951860	1954500	costs next to nothing to build a computer base.
1954500	1961140	But this time they amped it up to like 250 chromatic metal and like 500 ferret dust or
1961140	1961460	something.
1962820	1964500	It's like magnetized ferret or something.
1964500	1965460	It's enhanced.
1965460	1971940	So always keep the material on you so that you don't screw yourself over like I did.
1971940	1976420	Because if I hadn't done that and had to spend 45 minutes fixing that situation I got myself
1976420	1978900	in, I probably would have beat on stream.
1978900	1984260	So yeah, Quest Buster says I ran into a similar problem early on when I remembered that I
1984260	1987060	could only craft near a base and I was kind of far away.
1987060	1992580	As long as you keep the mats on you for a base at all times, you can always just craft
1992580	1993300	a new base.
1993300	1997300	It doesn't have to be the base that the game sends you to in that expedition.
1997300	1998340	That's something I learned.
1998340	2002020	So by the way, that expedition only has two or three weeks left in it.
2002020	2004660	So if you haven't started it yet, I would highly encourage you to.
2004660	2007060	And I believe the Switch has expeditions now.
2008020	2011940	Some of you on the Switch may have to tell me if I'm wrong on that, but I'm pretty sure
2011940	2016740	they added that with the big VR update that pushed for PlayStation is that Switch now
2016740	2017300	has expeditions.
2017300	2019460	Actually, it might have been before that for the encores.
2019460	2021620	So Switch, you can do the expeditions on.
2021620	2026420	So other big important one that I left out of my game a week.
2026420	2030020	I got to talk about this because I played so much of it this weekend.
2030020	2031860	I'm probably going cross-eyed.
2031860	2039220	And that is, I played the shit out of the Diablo 4 beta, which that went up this weekend
2039220	2045060	for those that either pre-ordered the game, which was me, or stomach to KFC Double Down,
2045620	2046660	which is other people.
2047300	2049620	Was it good or did it Diablo?
2050260	2052420	It is fantastic.
2053140	2055700	It is fantastic.
2055700	2058580	I am so hyped for Diablo.
2058580	2064980	So I may have had an inkling that this game was already in good shape because there was
2064980	2065860	a closed beta.
2065860	2070020	I can't say I was in the if I was in the closed beta, I'm not allowed to say I was.
2072100	2076260	But now that there's an open beta, we can be open and talk a little more about Diablo
2076260	2077620	4 and what's so great about it.
2078500	2084660	I think if you were put off by Diablo 3 in some ways, I think this is the sequel you
2084660	2090740	wanted to Diablo 2, because Diablo 2, there's a lot more of Diablo 2's roots in this game
2090740	2094820	in the way that it's, not to say, because I love Diablo 3 and I still love this one
2094820	2102820	because there's a lot of quality of life stuff that Diablo 3 brought in that now is in Diablo
2102820	2103300	4.
2103300	2104500	But they do different things.
2104500	2109620	Now it's like the open world and they have all these different systems and the storytelling
2109620	2112020	they have really amped up.
2112020	2114180	That was most impressive to me.
2114180	2119060	The way they do some of the artistic directions and the cut scenes and stuff is like stuff
2119060	2119780	in The Witcher.
2119780	2120660	It's really good.
2121540	2126020	So this game has been in development forever, but it's showing.
2127060	2132340	All of these different dungeons that you do, although yes, there's only so many background
2132340	2136820	patterns you see in a Diablo game, it's varied enough, these dungeons, to feel like you're
2136820	2138020	doing something new.
2138020	2141540	I played multiplayer with some other people that were in the open beta.
2141540	2143220	It played very well.
2143220	2150020	My only concern was that I got some really bad graphics stuttering playing on high-end
2150020	2152180	graphics on my less than a year old computer.
2152900	2155780	However, when I turned it down to medium, it was fine.
2155780	2160260	It is a beta, and those are the types of problems that are usually present in a beta.
2160260	2165060	So I'm not like, I've already dropped the $100 for the Super Mega Deluxe Edition of
2165060	2165620	this game.
2165620	2168740	So look, this doesn't, they've already got me.
2168740	2172340	I have no room to judge, given that I paid 100 for Midnight Suns.
2173060	2173860	There's, yeah.
2173860	2178820	So look, any little complaints I have here, or if you're going to go, well, it's just
2178820	2179460	a beta, Rob.
2179460	2180260	You shouldn't judge again.
2180260	2185300	No, I did not judge the game because I've paid a lot of money for the full retail release
2185300	2186660	of this game already.
2186660	2189140	So, but yeah.
2190660	2193140	Questbuster in chat says the world boss is horrifying.
2193140	2196500	I saw, I haven't seen the world boss, but I have seen world quests, and that's a new
2196500	2197380	thing to Diablo.
2197380	2201380	They actually put in MMO-like elements, but it's not an MMO.
2202020	2203140	It's weird.
2203140	2206420	Like, it's seamless for Diablo.
2206420	2207700	It works really well.
2207700	2214740	The open beta is next weekend, and you don't need a KFC Double Down, so I would encourage
2214740	2218100	if you're curious about it, check out the open beta next weekend.
2218100	2221300	It's only going to be three days, but that's your chance to see if it's for you or not.
2222100	2223940	Bobby Blackwolf says, are there colors?
2223940	2224500	Actually, yeah.
2224500	2228420	I know the game has been getting a little bit of flack because the overworld, the open
2228500	2233860	world is mostly a snowy world, so it's very plain white, snowed out, but when you start
2233860	2238580	to get into some of the dungeons that are shiny and have the metallic effects and the
2238580	2242420	fountains of blood, because this is a Diablo game, and it is nasty.
2242420	2248260	I'm not a big violent, so there are parts of this game that make me go, ugh, but those
2248260	2249780	are only in the cutscenes.
2249780	2255140	Usually as you're playing the game, the camera's pulled back so far, you don't see graphic,
2255140	2256180	graphic violence.
2256180	2256900	It's implied.
2256900	2258180	It's all implied.
2258180	2259220	When you're playing the game.
2259220	2261780	In cutscenes, it's more than implied.
2263460	2267220	So I will caution, but you can skip cutscenes if you are not interested in that.
2267220	2268900	You just want to click a lot and get loot.
2269540	2270340	There is that.
2270340	2275700	So Dark Tetsuya says, I'll probably get it on console, especially if the console versions
2275700	2277060	have local co-op.
2277060	2278420	I believe they do.
2278420	2282740	I'm not, don't quote me on that, but I'll tell you what it did have even during this
2282740	2286980	beta and will have in the full release that the other games needed badly.
2286980	2287780	Crossplay.
2288660	2290500	So remember I said I partied with friends.
2290500	2292660	I played with Shane and Xtavor and Xtavor's husband.
2293380	2298660	Myself, Xtavor's husband, and I think Xtavor were all on PC, but Shane was on PS5 and we
2298660	2300100	all played together seamlessly.
2300100	2303940	And thanks to the PS5 Discord integration, we were all on a Discord call.
2303940	2312900	So yeah, it's 2023, we are eating good in 2023 when it comes to video games.
2313460	2316660	Honestly, if it was just Diablo 4, I would be like, this is it.
2316660	2319380	This is the game I'm going to play more than any other this year.
2319380	2320420	I can't say that.
2321060	2325220	Theat rhythms already come out and you see I played too much of that as it is.
2326020	2331300	There is also, Zelda has that sequel coming out this year, Tears of the Kingdom.
2331300	2333300	That's like out two weeks before Diablo.
2333300	2336420	Three weeks after Diablo, Final Fantasy 16.
2336420	2339460	Later this winter, supposedly, Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth.
2340020	2341620	And that's just the tip of the iceberg.
2342420	2347540	This year is going to be unprecedented for the level of games that we're getting.
2347540	2353140	And if these other games have the quality of Diablo 4 and the polish that three years
2353140	2357540	of a pandemic and working extra long on the game has brought, holy shit.
2358740	2362340	Yeah, and folks in chat, Mike Deff says Street Fighter 6.
2362340	2366180	Bobby Blackwolf says Hi-Fi Rush, already a surprise hit coming.
2366180	2368580	You're right, we don't even know the surprise hits that are coming.
2369060	2371460	This is a year.
2372100	2375940	And then that doesn't even count games we can't stop playing.
2376660	2378100	Dead by Daylight, Dark Sakura.
2378980	2381620	Or Final Fantasy 14, self-call out.
2381620	2383780	You know, or Minecraft, Loki call out.
2383780	2389140	Whatever it is, there are still games that we still keep playing because they keep patching
2389140	2390980	them, enhancing them, and making them good.
2390980	2393940	Oh my God, Quest Buster reminded me, Starfield.
2395700	2396660	I have to quit my job.
2398900	2400420	Just kidding.
2400420	2401220	I love my job.
2401220	2401700	I really do.
2401700	2403140	And that's what pays for games.
2403140	2405220	But when am I going to have the time to do it?
2405220	2406100	I just, I'm not.
2410180	2412980	So this is, you are cracking me the hell up.
2412980	2413480	Why?
2414420	2416180	Just because you're being so funny.
2416180	2416900	But it's true.
2416900	2420980	This is such a good year to be excited about video games.
2420980	2424980	There's just, there really is something for everyone this year in particular.
2424980	2426820	And I don't know what it is about this year.
2426820	2427620	It really is there.
2427620	2429140	They're still yelling them off in chat.
2429140	2430660	Exo Primal coming out.
2431460	2433620	Persona rereleases coming out.
2433620	2437860	Cyberpunk, for those that got into that, is going to be getting, I believe, an expansion.
2437860	2439860	Octopath Traveler 2 just came out.
2439860	2441940	This is a great year for games.
2443380	2444180	Shedding a tear.
2444180	2444980	Yeah.
2444980	2445480	All right.
2446180	2446660	But yes.
2446660	2448740	Will your heart go on, Rob?
2449540	2450900	Near, far, wherever you are.
2451460	2454020	But Diablo 4, yes.
2454740	2457380	Bolded, underlined, italicized.
2457380	2458100	I'm excited.
2459060	2460660	So there it is.
2460660	2461460	All right.
2461460	2461940	Yes.
2461940	2465860	Actually, the open beta this weekend didn't even have Druid or Necromancer in it.
2465860	2467780	Those will be in the beta next weekend.
2467780	2472500	So I fully expect that everybody's going to be Druid or Necromancer or the people that
2472500	2475220	didn't play this weekend that are finally getting around to doing Sorcerer or whatever
2475220	2475620	they pick.
2475620	2480420	So it's going to be an interesting, by the way, your progress in the beta does not carry
2480420	2488260	over to the live game, except if you get to level 20 in the beta, you get a wolf doggy
2488260	2491220	that you carry around with you in your little backpack.
2491220	2492900	It's a cosmetic reward.
2492900	2499620	So I'm trying to show an image of what that looks like here.
2499620	2500820	So we're live on Twitch.
2502500	2503220	I found one.
2503220	2504420	How do I get it to come up here?
2506100	2506820	Sorry.
2506820	2508420	Very excited about the whole thing.
2508420	2509140	I'm doing live.
2510020	2514660	I've been waiting for this game a very, very long time, and it's finally here, and I'm
2514660	2515540	very excited.
2516100	2520900	This is not the best representation as we're live, because I can't get the gift to play
2520900	2521380	any larger.
2521380	2522180	Oh, maybe I do that.
2522180	2522680	There we go.
2523460	2528020	It's actually a little wolf dog that sleeps in a little cradle in your back.
2528020	2530500	That is the reward you get for getting to level 20, right?
2531620	2532660	Oh, my God.
2532660	2534980	I don't even like Diablo, and I want to play this now.
2535860	2538660	Here's the thing, and this is the dangerous part.
2538660	2543700	Because Diablo four, they're not supposed to be doing the same stuff they did with Immortal
2543700	2545780	where it's all because Immortal was a free to play game.
2545780	2546500	That's old news.
2547380	2551620	The experience you buy it and whatever, it's all in one, but they're still going to be
2551620	2554660	doing battle passes and all that stuff for cosmetics.
2555300	2556740	But here's the thing.
2556740	2558660	Diablo kills it with cosmetics.
2559220	2560180	Case and point.
2560180	2564900	What I just showed, like, there are lots of people like Dark Sakura, lots of people that
2564900	2569140	are like, I wasn't caring about Diablo until you showed me that.
2570420	2572180	Honestly, it's still not enough for me to play it.
2573620	2573940	Fine.
2576020	2578100	But I seriously had the thought.
2578100	2579060	You had the thought.
2580100	2581620	You had an impure thought.
2582900	2583700	I did.
2583700	2587700	That just moment of absolute weakness was like,
2587700	2594580	All right, let's see.
2594580	2598900	We're going to move on and get into some other stuff that's going on in the gaming world
2598900	2601060	and talk about what's up in news this week.
2601060	2604980	First, though, I want to address this because we had a redeem.
2604980	2606500	So we have a redeem on our channel.
2606500	2610180	If you want to turn in some points, you can get a post show shout out.
2610180	2612900	And Dark Tetsuya actually redeemed one of those.
2612980	2618420	But I am going to upgrade this for free on the house to a during the show shout out.
2618420	2623300	Usually that means it hits the podcast feed because this is an important one to state.
2623300	2627540	And that is, if at all possible, can I donate this one to my wife?
2627540	2628580	Meeshkins.
2628580	2629700	Today's her birthday.
2630260	2631460	Absolutely, you can.
2632260	2634500	And I want to wish a very happy birthday to Meesh.
2634500	2640340	Meeshkins, but we all call Meesh for short, who has been such a support, not just here
2640340	2643380	at the VoG network, but I know I see her on my streams.
2643380	2648580	I'm sure she pops in to all the other faces around the voice geeks network and on Twitter
2648580	2649860	and all of that stuff.
2649860	2651380	Such a support of the network.
2651380	2655780	So this one's upgraded on the house because I want to personally wish you a happy birthday
2655780	2663140	and hope you have had a wonderful one and may the next year bring lots of awesome games.
2663140	2665140	Spoiler alert, it's going to.
2665140	2667940	So we love you, Meeshi.
2667940	2672820	All right, well, now let's get into some gaming news.
2673380	2674580	What's going on in the industry?
2675220	2678820	Here's a big one to start us off about the place we call home on Sunday nights.
2678820	2679380	Right, Loki?
2679940	2688180	Yes, apparently the CEO of Twitch, Emmet Sheer, is no longer at the company after 16 years
2688180	2688820	working there.
2689940	2694980	Basically, he has resigned, I think having to do with raising his children.
2695860	2701700	Basically, he had posted a blog post saying with my first child just born, I've been reflecting
2701700	2702900	on my future at Twitch.
2702900	2706980	Twitch often feels like a child to me that I've been raising well.
2706980	2712340	And while I will always want to be there if Twitch needs me, at 16 years old, it feels
2712340	2715140	to me that Twitch is ready to move out of the house and venture alone.
2715940	2718260	So cool.
2718260	2719220	Focus on family.
2719540	2726180	I don't know who else they have coming in, though, to take his page.
2726180	2726900	It's out there.
2726900	2728900	It's somebody with the company today.
2730180	2730740	Keep digging.
2730740	2732180	It's in there somewhere.
2732180	2733300	It's currently.
2734500	2735300	Someone.
2735300	2735800	Yes.
2736500	2738500	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says he's still at the company.
2738500	2740660	He's an advisor now, but that, you know.
2740660	2741540	Yeah, that's fine.
2741540	2744260	Sometimes that can be more of a ceremonial title, but you know.
2744260	2744500	Yeah.
2744500	2747460	Basically, he said, you know, it's family.
2747700	2752020	With Greville, my son, the time has come for me to focus my energies on building that tiny
2752020	2755140	little startup family, and I'm ready to dedicate my energies there.
2755140	2755700	Cool.
2755700	2756580	I think you should.
2756580	2756980	Yeah.
2756980	2759540	I mean, you can't fault him for the reasons.
2759540	2760820	The timing is certainly.
2760820	2763780	I mean, there's always going to be people that read a lot into the timing, right?
2763780	2767220	Because of all the things that Twitch has gone through in the past year.
2767220	2770980	I think more so the fact that the YouTube CEO just stepped down a couple of weeks ago.
2770980	2773380	That's the one where I'm like, well, that's interesting.
2773380	2774260	But I mean.
2774260	2776260	He doesn't want to do it, too.
2776260	2782340	It doesn't like any time that he stepped down, there's going to be people trying to read
2782340	2784580	the tea leaves going, well, what really happened?
2784580	2786100	Was he forced out?
2786100	2786420	You know?
2786420	2793700	Well, I mean, it's probably like, you know, the drama that was last year and stuff probably
2795140	2796820	doesn't hurt as well.
2796820	2800980	Like, I mean, yeah, it's like, yeah, I'm leaving for a family, but all this other drama, if
2800980	2802660	I could be away from that as well.
2802660	2803060	Cool.
2803620	2803780	Yeah.
2803780	2806420	It's like a win win there, I guess.
2807220	2812020	Bobby Blackwolf in chat points out Dan Clancy was the president of Twitch and is now the
2812020	2812580	CEO.
2812580	2813780	He took over immediately.
2813780	2817540	So not a huge changing of the guard to go from president to CEO.
2817540	2820020	I would not call like a major culture shift.
2820020	2821940	This isn't like what happened to Twitter.
2822660	2823860	I'll just leave it at that.
2823860	2829220	This is just, you know, obviously somebody who is already in a very high role just going
2829220	2830500	to a different role.
2830580	2835060	So I wouldn't expect a lot changes as to, you know, what's coming up in the future and
2835060	2835620	all of that stuff.
2835620	2838180	It's just kind of one of those things where it's like, oh, this is interesting because,
2838180	2843540	you know, Emmett dates back to the Justin TV days and where Twitch was born and all
2843540	2845620	of this and now is leaving.
2845620	2849860	But it's hard to stay at a company for even 15 years.
2849860	2854740	I think when you start to get to that point, hell, I was at a job for 14 years and that's
2854740	2859940	when I finally started to realize that nothing else was ever going to happen if I didn't
2859940	2860740	change companies.
2861460	2862260	And I did.
2862260	2863780	And that's great.
2863780	2867300	You know, and not to say because some people do end up with a company they love and they
2867300	2868980	do stay longer than 14 years.
2868980	2869860	That's great.
2869860	2875140	I'm talking about most people, you know, when they invest years and years in a company,
2875140	2877060	this is the point where they start to kind of look around.
2877060	2880180	What else do I want to say that I did, you know, professionally?
2880180	2882100	And there's probably some of that going on as well.
2882100	2882660	And that's okay.
2882660	2887780	There's not much more you can do once you're CEO of the company.
2887780	2888340	That's right.
2888340	2888820	That's true.
2889540	2894260	Questbuster says it could also be he just wants to leave the circus behind for a new
2894260	2894980	chapter.
2894980	2899140	Twitch is constantly under pressure from Amazon to turn a profit, from what I understand,
2899140	2902820	plus dealing with all the dirty laundry aired over the years about the culture.
2902820	2906420	SSG100Matt says I've had several co-workers leave right after having a kid.
2906420	2908260	I've heard other folks doing so as well.
2908260	2911140	Having a kid seems to be a transition spot for a lot of folks.
2911140	2911380	Sure.
2912180	2916180	Tigerclaw says I remember when Justin TV was doing the real life stuff, then switching
2916180	2919700	to the gaming stuff only to go back to the real life stuff when they wanted more people
2919700	2920180	to join.
2920180	2923940	Yeah, it's been an interesting journey, this whole thing.
2923940	2926820	But, you know, here we are all these years later.
2927940	2932260	But I would say just going back to what Questbuster says, I think the interesting thing that could
2932260	2938980	happen is you might see some other changes to try to monetize this platform a little
2938980	2939300	more.
2940180	2944660	And I don't know if that's going to be, people are going to be forced onto an, that's my
2944660	2944980	worry.
2945060	2946660	That's always in the back of my head.
2946660	2953380	So when we tape live here at the Voice of the Geeks Network, I always play ads for a
2953380	2956980	couple of minutes because that's how we get the pre-roll ads turned off.
2956980	2960660	So before we actually start, I play pre-roll ads for a couple of minutes.
2960660	2965460	So that way for about 40 minutes, no ads actually play, they're off now.
2965460	2969060	So if people come into the channel, they see ads before they see us.
2969940	2974180	Rob, it's been changed a little bit because when I run, I always start with a three-minute
2974180	2979620	ad for my five-minute intro on my stream and it takes out 62 minutes.
2979620	2980020	Yes.
2980020	2982500	So they did change it recently.
2982500	2986420	So you used to only be able to do a minute and a half of ads up to 30 minutes.
2986980	2989700	Now you can do three minutes of ads up to 60 minutes.
2989700	2991620	And I do the same on my personal stream.
2991620	2995700	However, here at VOG, because we're still transitioning between Bobby's show and our
2995700	2999860	show and we don't want people to be stuck in ads too long, I capped it at two minutes.
2999860	3003300	Two minutes is a normal TV break and that's 40 minutes of pre-roll ads.
3003300	3004900	So that's enough.
3005540	3009460	And then that way we're not stalling too long between Bobby's show and kind of keeping the
3009460	3010180	things moving here.
3010180	3014660	But yeah, but that whole thing is still optional for broadcasters.
3014660	3019540	My fear is three minutes of ads an hour is going to become mandatory.
3019540	3024340	That is my concern because Twitch has no problem if you opt into it, cutting off your fee.
3024340	3026420	And they're trying to sweeten the deal.
3026420	3029780	They're trying to get people to opt into it by offering more incentives.
3029780	3030340	And I get it.
3030340	3031540	There's a lot of people that are doing it.
3032180	3033220	You got to do what you got to do.
3034660	3037460	But I feel like Twitch is going to make that mandatory.
3037460	3038820	I can't help but dread that.
3039380	3040100	I wish as a-
3040100	3042580	It technically kind of is.
3042580	3048100	I mean, the ads themselves, they're going to happen whether you want them to or not.
3048100	3048900	That's true.
3048900	3051620	You can just jump in and take control.
3052820	3054100	Yes, that's true.
3054100	3055380	When you want to.
3055380	3059380	And I even, I mean, I have a disclaimer in mind that, hey, if you don't like it, sub
3059940	3060980	or Twitch Turbo.
3060980	3062020	But still, you know.
3063140	3067460	Tigerclaw in chat says, how long before they set up a subscription where you have to pay
3067460	3068900	to broadcast on Twitch?
3068900	3070580	I'm going to put this out in the ether.
3070580	3070980	And I-
3072820	3074980	Bobby's going to kill me when he sees me at Dragon Combat.
3074980	3076980	I'm willing to put this out there.
3077940	3084900	If they wanted to charge VOG Network to broadcast on Twitch ad-free a reasonable amount of money,
3084900	3089060	let's say $19.99 a month, and we could broadcast ad-free, we'd do it.
3089060	3093300	We have enough support from you guys that come in with the subs and the bits and all
3093300	3093700	that stuff.
3093700	3094820	Again, a reasonable price.
3094820	3096740	It was like $99.99 a month.
3096740	3097240	No way.
3097700	3098180	No.
3098180	3102980	But like if it was $19.99 a month or something, I'd pay it to turn off the ads completely
3102980	3103860	on this channel.
3103860	3105220	I'd be willing to do it.
3105220	3105620	So-
3105620	3112340	And if it was, Rob, if it was $99.99 a year, that would be actually even better.
3112340	3113140	Sure, sure.
3113140	3114340	I'd be willing to do it.
3114340	3114820	Okay.
3114820	3117300	Bobby says, why would I kill you for something I agree with?
3117620	3120420	For making a definitive statement without consulting with you first.
3120420	3122260	But thankfully you agree with me on this one.
3126980	3131940	But usually I know better than to make definitive statements about the future of VOG Network.
3131940	3134020	By the way, did you know we're going to be getting a new-
3134020	3134660	No, forget it.
3134660	3135160	I'm not-
3138340	3138740	All right.
3138740	3140740	Y'all are special.
3142340	3144500	But anyway, I would see that as-
3145460	3147300	Again, I hope Twitch considers that.
3147300	3152340	If they're going to make the ads mandatory, honestly, let me pay a nominal fee to just
3152340	3153620	dodge all of that shit.
3153620	3155060	I would be willing to pay it.
3155780	3157300	So because I think-
3157300	3158100	I think I would too.
3158100	3159540	Yeah, the support of the-
3159540	3162660	I don't have a gigantic audience on my personal channel and that's okay.
3162660	3163780	I don't want one.
3163780	3166580	I have enough support where it would work itself out.
3166580	3169220	I'd essentially be able to broadcast for free, you know?
3169220	3170260	And I'm okay with that.
3170260	3171220	That's all I want.
3171220	3172820	I want a gigantic audience.
3173140	3178660	Tigerclaw says, now what if you pay the subscription to broadcast on Twitch and part of that subscription
3178660	3181300	allows you to play music without getting copyright stricken?
3182100	3186260	That would be a very smart thing for Twitch to do.
3186260	3191460	They should make those deals and allow people to pay money to license the music and do that.
3191460	3192820	That would be fantastic.
3192820	3197060	I think a lot of people would be very excited about that, especially how this is growing
3197060	3201060	as music in real life and your DJ sets and all that.
3201940	3206100	As it's growing as a platform like that, I think that's actually a great idea.
3207700	3211780	Those agreements are going to be hard to get because the record companies are greedy as fu-
3211780	3212980	And never going to do it.
3212980	3215140	And they're never going to do it, but it's nice.
3215140	3217060	It's not Twitch's fault in that department.
3217060	3221380	What a bunch of us have to do now is we can still play our music during the live stream
3221380	3223140	and they don't seem to care.
3223140	3225140	Yeah, you have to set it OBS a certain way.
3225140	3229700	Yeah, you just can't have it as a part of your VOD, which kind of gets me in trouble
3229700	3231700	because I sing along with my music.
3231700	3232020	Yeah.
3232020	3238020	And one day I accidentally on my personal stream, I did something where I was using
3238020	3242660	a new scene and I hadn't made the Spotify and the rest of my audio separate on that
3242660	3243140	scene.
3243140	3246340	So I actually played it and I got muted like that.
3247700	3249940	But it's not like it's my entire stream.
3249940	3252100	It's just my opening segment, but it is what it is.
3253540	3259300	I would like to say for streamers who are on max like me, if you want to know how to
3259380	3262420	do it on a Mac because it's a little bit more involved, let me know.
3262420	3263380	I'll help you out.
3263380	3267300	It's actually not that hard either because we used very similar technology when we were
3267300	3269620	all in the same place using the Mac Mini to broadcast.
3270180	3273940	That's how we would strip the localized audio out of the feed.
3273940	3276500	We had to separate it to get it to work, but it worked.
3276500	3278500	Yeah, I used loopback and EQMac.
3279140	3282500	Yeah, I think loopback is essential.
3282500	3283000	Yeah.
3283940	3285700	Alrighty, let's move on.
3285700	3288900	Let's talk about another video game that has left.
3288900	3294500	It's exclusive window for the Sony PlayStation, and it's now going to be on its way to Xbox,
3294500	3296500	and that is Ghostwire Tokyo.
3297140	3299860	Ghostwire Tokyo launched on PC and PlayStation 5.
3299860	3304820	This was interesting because it was a Bethesda title, but Microsoft bought Bethesda, but
3304820	3307780	this is one of the ones that still had an exclusive window.
3307780	3313780	So now that window is up, you bet it's coming to Xbox Series X and S on April 12th.
3313780	3317620	There will also be new content because, of course, they want to sweeten the pot here.
3317620	3320420	Now that Bethesda is a Microsoft subsidiary.
3321300	3326420	Tango Game Works made this game notable because they made The Evil Within and have had a lot
3326420	3328420	of success this year with Hi-Fi Rush.
3328420	3334340	So Ghostwire Tokyo was also one of their games, and this is where you're going around Tokyo
3334340	3336180	and it's a supernatural sort of thing.
3336900	3338020	We wanted to play this.
3338020	3338660	Yeah.
3338660	3342740	The reviews were a little mixed at launch because they were saying that the combat was a little
3342740	3346340	same-sy and there was some mechanical building blocks that were recycled, but some people
3346340	3347300	were really into it.
3347300	3352180	And some people think that Japan's folklore that plays into the story is done very well.
3352180	3354180	So there's, you know, there's kind of mixed.
3354180	3356500	Mixed means some really liked it and some didn't.
3358180	3363700	Yeah, Eurogamer in one of their reviews said, I can say that dull combat aside, exploring
3363700	3365460	Shibuya never bores.
3365460	3366900	So there's that.
3366900	3371940	Anyway, Game Pass will have the games as well on the 12th of April, and there will be new
3371940	3372500	content.
3372500	3374500	It's called the Spider's Thread update.
3374500	3376660	That's extended scenes for the main story.
3376660	3379780	New locations to explore, including a school area.
3379780	3381140	Oh, we love a spooky school.
3381860	3386900	And new enemies like the Silent Gays, the Sanguine Dancer, and Retribution.
3387460	3388740	There's also new skills.
3388740	3394580	I thought you said Silent Gays, and I'm like, no one I've ever met has been silent.
3394580	3397140	G-A-Z-E, Dar Sakura.
3397140	3401140	I know, I thought of it afterwards, but that's the image that popped into my head.
3402900	3406980	I was like, and then my brain went, it's the gay version of Silent Hill.
3408980	3411380	There's new skills coming as well.
3411380	3412020	No, I love it.
3412900	3416180	Anyway, coming out for the Xbox on April 12th.
3416180	3421060	Not surprised at all to see that, you know, now that this Bethesda, you know, signed before
3421060	3425220	they were bought by Microsoft, it's getting a little enhanced and, you know, there'll
3425220	3427140	probably be more people to check it out this time around.
3427140	3428740	It's going to be very interesting.
3428740	3433380	So we'll see, maybe the game will get a second peak or something like that.
3433380	3434500	So, all right.
3435220	3438180	Let's move on and talk about this next story.
3438180	3440500	This is always an interesting time of year, right, Dar Sakura?
3442020	3450740	Yeah, we are coming up on the Video Game Hall of Fame voting and ballots and things.
3450740	3452180	Who's going to get in there?
3453460	3456900	We have the 12 finalists right now.
3457860	3464900	There's Age of Empires, Angry Birds, Barbie Fashion Designer, Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare,
3464900	3470420	Computer Space, FIFA International Soccer, GoldenEye 007, the one that makes me motion
3470420	3476020	sick, The Last of Us, NBA 2K, Quake, Wii Sports, and Wizardry.
3477140	3481860	Now, it's pretty hard to narrow down.
3481860	3482900	I mean, there's a few on these.
3482900	3484580	I'm like, no, they don't know.
3484580	3487060	Yeah, there's some I could definitely take off.
3487060	3492180	But there's some on the list that I would think are kind of middling.
3492820	3496340	And then there's some I think definitely have a place there.
3496340	3499780	You know, I could make a list.
3501220	3507540	But as far as, you know, the thing about the games is that these are games that are supposed
3507540	3512900	to have had a big influence on the popular culture of the video game industry.
3513300	3518820	Notable for different things like, I mean, there's a very big reason Barbie Fashion Designer
3518820	3519300	is on there.
3519300	3521140	You may go, oh, it's a Barbie game.
3521140	3531300	But it was one of the first games marketed to female gamers, you know, to break that
3531300	3535620	sort of hold that the industry had of only marketing to male gamers.
3537300	3541620	You know, Wii Sports, we know why that's on there because it brought in an older crowd.
3541860	3550420	You know, Computer Space was one of the first arcade releases, 1971.
3550420	3556900	I might have almost done this game before, but it was basically taking these types of
3556900	3560660	games out of, you know, people's computer labs, pretty much.
3562340	3565940	You know, we've got all sorts of notoriety.
3565940	3570740	And of course, there's always the fan voting that's online through March 22nd.
3570820	3572660	So we only have a couple more days.
3572660	3574820	And that's the player's choice ballot.
3574820	3580180	The ones with the most public votes from one ballot will be counted alongside the ballot
3580180	3583540	submitted by members of the committee of experts.
3583540	3587940	And then they will be conducted in a virtual ceremony on May 4th.
3588740	3593700	Well, Dark Sakura, since you mentioned you could make a list, let's put that to the test
3593700	3595460	here live on air.
3595460	3598340	And so what we've done, we've actually taken those 12.
3598420	3604660	My very high technological WordPad document live on air, we've actually taken the 12 games
3604660	3609460	and I'd like us now, kind of as hosts here, we're going to each go around and pick the
3609460	3612820	five that we would vote for and why.
3612820	3616020	So in other words, which of these queens should go home tonight and why?
3616020	3620580	No, which five games would you move into?
3620580	3624180	So it's kind of an interesting version of listless where we're changing the rules a
3624180	3627780	little bit, but we're doing it the way they're going to vote.
3627780	3631220	So which five would you keep and why?
3631220	3633300	So I'll start with Dark Sakura.
3634260	3634760	Okay.
3635460	3642980	So, and I will admit I had honorable mentions like Goldeneye was an honorable mention, but
3642980	3650100	I actually started with Barbie Fashion Designer because of the marketing behind it.
3650660	3652260	It really did break a mold.
3652260	3656980	It was fully marketed toward a completely different demographic than what had normally
3656980	3659460	been advertised to and it belongs on there.
3660980	3661620	Last of Us.
3662420	3669620	Number one, that game has had a pretty massive cultural impact and in the years that it's
3669620	3674900	been out, we've got a TV show based on it that I understand is really good.
3674900	3678020	I need to marathon it when I can ugly cry by myself.
3678020	3681060	And yes, both of those games made me super ugly cry.
3681620	3686260	They, it tackled some very important, you know, social issues in it.
3686820	3691700	And honestly enough, it's a game that has that lasting power.
3691700	3692980	It's an instant classic.
3694660	3702180	I'm going to then go to Quake because not just because of what Quake is as an FPS, because
3702180	3709620	we had others before that, you know, we had Doom, we had Hexen, but Quake was really the
3709620	3714980	one that I think brought it out of a more niche area.
3714980	3723220	And on top of that, the modding, all the mods and we've got, you know, so many references
3723220	3728660	in pop culture to Quake, not to mention we have MC Hawkings with Quake Master, just saying.
3730020	3733220	So I think that Quake definitely belongs on the list.
3734820	3737940	Wizardry, I put it on there because it's a classic.
3738740	3745380	It spawned so many sequels and it's been sort of like a granddaddy of that genre.
3747060	3750900	And then last I added computer space for the reasons before.
3750900	3754260	It was an early public arcade title.
3754260	3757860	It had that yellow twisty looking cabinet with the...
3758420	3765860	It looked very 70's chic, you know, I think it was great, but it brought those games out
3765860	3773060	of, you know, basically the nerd caves, you know, those old IBM's and brought it out into
3773060	3778180	the public eye, you know, sitting there amongst the pinball tables and, you know, pre-Space
3778180	3780500	Invaders, you know, if I recall correctly.
3781140	3790020	So that one, I think, if not for computer space, we might not have had stuff like Space
3790100	3796340	Invaders and Galaga Galaxian, you know, all of those sorts of games.
3796340	3800420	I think that these are all notable for those reasons.
3800420	3801220	All right.
3801220	3805140	So we've put some gold stars up by the ones that Dark Sakura has named.
3805140	3806580	So Loki, let's go over to you.
3806580	3810740	What would be the five from this list that you would induct into the Hall of Fame?
3811860	3812260	Let's see.
3812260	3819140	I would probably do Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare since it basically set the gold standard
3819220	3822340	for modern FPS shooter games.
3822340	3827460	I mean, it was really pivotal, considering that the first three Call of Duty games are
3827460	3831460	all World War II games, then they pivoted to it and who would have thought that it would
3831460	3833220	have been extremely popular?
3833220	3835380	So for sure, Call of Duty.
3836180	3841220	Then I'd probably do Mirror Quake because, you know, it's one of the first polygonal
3842100	3843220	FPS games.
3843220	3849380	It's just a really awesome game that basically, you know, helped propel the genre forward.
3850100	3850660	Wii Sports.
3852900	3855140	Yeah, I mean, they have that as well, I guess.
3855700	3858100	I don't know if I'd Hall of Fame that part.
3859620	3861380	You were starting to say Wii Sports, Loki?
3861380	3866660	Yeah, Wii Sports because it made games more accessible and brought in a whole bunch of
3866660	3868500	people that wouldn't normally play games.
3870260	3870900	Let's see.
3870980	3880580	I would say probably Goldeneye because I know that was a very popular multiplayer game.
3880580	3885220	Definitely pushed split screen multiplayer quite a bit.
3886020	3889860	I think it really also pushed the capabilities of the N64.
3889860	3892180	That's why I almost put it on my list.
3892180	3892980	Yeah, for sure.
3893300	3901140	I guess I'm not familiar with Wizardry.
3903460	3908900	I guess Computer Space because it's one of the, you know, the earlier arcade games.
3908900	3911300	So that's definitely pivotal as well.
3912340	3914020	Anyway, I got one more left.
3914020	3915060	Nope, that was it.
3915060	3915300	Nope.
3915300	3917380	One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
3917380	3918820	Yep, there's ten stars up on the board.
3918820	3921060	So now we're going to me.
3921060	3921700	All right.
3921700	3923460	So here's what I would do.
3924020	3928820	I would say number one, by far the biggest one on this list for me, you know, everybody
3928820	3929300	has opinions.
3929300	3930020	That's fine for me.
3930020	3933140	The biggest one on this list that deserves to be in the Hall of Fame is Wii Sports.
3933700	3939940	I think when history looks back on what gaming was in the aughts, I think, you know, Wii
3939940	3946500	and everything that this game did for pushing an entire platform forward and really selling
3946500	3949940	Nintendo's, you know, silly named console and all that forward.
3949940	3953300	I think Wii Sports is going to be seen as pivotal for that.
3954180	3956900	Number two on my list, I would say Quake, actually.
3956900	3959140	So that's one that all three of us are going to end up saying.
3959700	3962340	I think you have several shooters that are represented on this list.
3962340	3966420	I think Quake is the one, again, it really defined an era of PC gaming.
3966420	3970660	And I think, you know, as was already brought up, the mods, especially when you consider
3970660	3977780	things like Team Fortress that then turned into their own things, I think is huge.
3977780	3979380	So I think Quake, absolutely.
3979940	3984500	It looks like that's the only one all three of us are probably going to say is one of
3984500	3985780	the huge ones in the list.
3987060	3987780	Other titles.
3988660	3994900	I would say The Last of Us might be a little bit early.
3994900	3999220	And I understand maybe some of the concerns with that, with The Last of Us.
3999220	4006180	But I do think that, especially with the success of the TV show, and I think when people kind
4006180	4010980	of look back on gaming and TV and all that medium and stuff, I think The Last of Us is
4010980	4012580	going to hold up very strong.
4012580	4017060	So I think as far as like a strong contemporary choice, The Last of Us would definitely be
4017060	4017620	on my list.
4018820	4020340	So that was one, two, three.
4020340	4025060	So number four for me, I'm actually going to say Wizardry.
4025060	4033380	I think, again, there's really an era of early PC gaming that Wizardry really influenced.
4033380	4039060	And I think as far as we look at role playing games as they were developed by Japanese companies
4039060	4043460	and role playing games as they were developed by American companies, Wizardry was really
4044100	4051540	the roots of where the American developed ones kind of ended up going as a result.
4052260	4056740	And then the last one I would put on my list, and this may surprise you, I'm actually not
4056740	4058100	going to go with what you think.
4058100	4060740	And I'm going to put Barbie Fashion Designer as my number five.
4061700	4066100	I think kind of as Dark Sakura already kind of hit on the main points of that, as much
4066100	4071460	as you might look at that and go, LOL Barbie, I think it's important to note that, again,
4071460	4079220	this was the game industry acknowledging that there were more people that games needed to
4079220	4085620	be accessible to and open to and targeted to, to bring into the gaming world.
4085780	4091300	And I think really just set, again, a standard for an entire genre of
4092020	4096260	Nancy Drew type games and things that followed it in the PC era.
4096260	4097460	So those are my five.
4097460	4098260	It's very tropey.
4098820	4099780	Yeah, yeah.
4099780	4101540	I mean, it's very tropey.
4101540	4104340	But again, it's the Nith event.
4104980	4105700	Significant.
4105700	4106420	It's significant.
4107380	4107780	Yeah.
4107780	4112740	And in my opinion, FIFA and NBA 2K should never be in the Hall of Fame ever because
4112740	4118740	of the crap that they perpetuated in this industry, the absolute vile monetization
4118740	4121780	practices that are FIFA Ultimate Team.
4122900	4124020	To hell with that series.
4124020	4128980	I'm sorry, but they put FIFA 23 as the box art, you know, so they're representing their
4128980	4131700	most recent game as Hall of Fame worthy.
4131700	4132340	No way.
4132340	4133860	That is never going to make it in there.
4133860	4140260	And the NBA 2K is just as bad, you know, with the monetization and just the half-assed
4140260	4144420	development on these games churning out the same thing year after year.
4144420	4144900	No, thanks.
4144900	4146660	That does not belong in the Hall of Fame.
4146660	4147220	I would agree.
4147940	4150020	But Dalton, in support, tell us how you really feel.
4150020	4153620	And honestly, for me, the only reason I didn't say Call of Duty and GoldenEye is that you
4153620	4157620	already had another shooter on there and pretty much all that's left after that is you have
4157620	4159460	Angry Birds and Age of Empires.
4159460	4161460	There's nothing wrong with either of those games, certainly.
4161460	4166580	And again, I think Age of Empires also speaks certainly to a very distinct genre of game
4167140	4169380	I think is already represented in the Hall of Fame.
4169380	4172020	But I understand Age of Empires significance.
4172020	4175140	It's just, you know, you have to pick five from the 12 and that's just when it falls
4175140	4175700	by the wayside.
4175700	4177540	It's a similar thing with Angry Birds.
4177540	4183140	I understand that Angry Birds, as far as mobile titles go, is hugely significant.
4183140	4186980	And with the movies and everything and the marketing and everything else, I get it.
4186980	4190100	But I just don't know if I look back on that game fondly.
4190900	4195860	My thing about Angry Birds, why I think it is on the list, not just for what you were
4195860	4203700	saying, is because it spawned a whole, I would say, push for the casual gamer in gaming culture.
4205300	4206580	You know, the mobile gamer.
4206580	4211220	And on top of that, it turned into a massive merchandising empire.
4211780	4216100	You know, if anything, I would say that the Angry Birds franchise is one of the biggest
4216100	4224260	ones to sort of show about the influence of video games and merchandising in selling,
4225060	4228660	you know, plushies and shirts and movies.
4228660	4232580	And that's where I think there's notability there.
4234420	4238180	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, to me, the Hall of Fame isn't about what you think of fondly.
4238180	4240580	It is more about what's influential in the gaming.
4240580	4243140	And Angry Birds was huge with both of my parents.
4243140	4246260	It's the only game they played because it was accessible to them in their 70s.
4246980	4248420	Respect that viewpoint.
4248420	4251300	I stand by my choices under the criteria that you provided.
4252020	4255460	So, and everybody's going to look at that differently because everybody has their own
4255460	4256260	little anecdotes.
4256900	4260420	Wizardry, I think, looking at chat and just looking at the general comments in there,
4260420	4266260	I think a lot of people that probably played it sort of kind of, and other people have
4266260	4266820	never played it.
4266820	4268900	And so that maybe they don't understand why it's influential.
4268900	4269380	And I get it.
4269380	4270980	And I'm not faulting anyone for it.
4270980	4273860	You know, it's just everybody's experiences is different a little bit, right?
4273860	4281060	So anyway, let's take a look and see what we decided as show hosts should be the top
4281060	4281460	five.
4281460	4284420	And it looks like we actually kind of have a top six.
4284420	4286900	It looks like the one we're all in agreement on is Quake.
4286900	4288900	So Quake definitely makes the list.
4289540	4295540	And then from there, you kind of have a five-way tie between Barbie Fashion Designer,
4296260	4306980	Computer Space, Last of Us, Wii Sports, and Wizardry kind of all barely make the list
4306980	4307300	there.
4307300	4311540	So it would come down to those choices for us here at Orange Lounge Radio.
4311540	4313140	So that was fun.
4313140	4318180	I just also think it's very interesting hearing what we all think of these selections
4318180	4319620	by going through a list like this.
4321060	4326660	You know, it goes to show that different games mean different things to different people.
4326660	4327380	Yeah, yeah.
4327380	4332820	But when you can see the commonality amongst, you know, why we would choose what we chose,
4333700	4336900	you know, it also speaks to how games can bring people together.
4336900	4338660	Yeah, for sure, for sure.
4339780	4346420	Also, I had to link that to my friend Annie of Saver and Stuff Bomb Never Told You because
4346420	4348180	I know she's going to vote for Last of Us.
4349700	4353620	SSJ100Matt says, Loki and Rob have a point and I agree about the monetization stuff,
4353620	4356580	but I do think there is a place for licensed sports games.
4356580	4360340	Sure, if it was NHL 93, I would have put it in my five.
4360340	4362420	If it was NBA Jam, I would have put it in my five.
4362900	4367860	If they had represented those by like a certain version of the game, you know, an earlier
4367860	4369220	one prior to all this stuff.
4369220	4371540	Yeah, I would be on board with that for sure.
4371540	4378020	But they represented it with the most recent box art and that could be just the decision
4378020	4379060	of the article or whatever.
4379060	4383860	But if you're represented by the most recent version, then I'm sorry, I'm not going to
4383860	4385860	agree that that should be a Hall of Fame material.
4385860	4386360	Yeah.
4387220	4387720	All right.
4388500	4391300	But everybody, everybody can have their perspective.
4391300	4395300	And so it will be interesting to see what the five end up actually being.
4395300	4399620	I think even though it didn't make our list, I do think Angry Birds makes the actual top
4399620	4399940	five.
4399940	4400660	I really do.
4400660	4404980	I just I think voters will put like, again, it's how I would have voted.
4404980	4410340	I think the way voters will vote, I think it'll be Angry Birds, Wii Sports, Last of
4410340	4410900	Us, Quake.
4410900	4412420	I think those are all shoo-ins.
4412420	4414340	The fifth one is going to be the wild card for me.
4414340	4420740	I'm not sure if something like Computer Space gets in there or Wizardry or maybe surprises
4420740	4422100	me and it is one of the sports titles.
4422100	4422900	I don't know.
4422900	4423460	So we'll see.
4424420	4430260	Really don't see how Computer Space couldn't make it in given, you know, we've got, quote,
4430260	4431780	experts voting on this.
4432980	4438100	And, and I mean, if, if you're, you know, people who have been prominent in the industry
4438100	4443060	and have followed the trends and hopefully would be sort of our same generation or maybe
4443060	4446420	even older, they might understand why something like that would belong in there.
4446420	4454420	So I'm, I'm really hoping that, that we have that love given to our, our quote for parent
4454420	4455460	games, you know?
4456340	4457380	So, all right.
4458100	4459220	Well, let's move on.
4459220	4466020	Let's move on to the next story, which we'll talk a little bit about maybe the future of
4466020	4467220	games a little bit.
4467220	4471380	Although there's a little bit of what's old is new again in this, but I'll let Loki talk
4471380	4473540	about it and then kind of say what I have to say on this.
4474260	4474500	Yeah.
4474500	4480900	So they've got this new Fortnite Unreal Editor or Unreal Editor for Fortnite.
4480900	4486500	It's a PC app that's designed for developing and publishing games and experiences directly
4486500	4487860	into Fortnite.
4487860	4493140	They say that with many Unreal, many of Unreal 5's powerful tools and workflows at your
4493140	4498820	fingertips, including custom asset import, modeling materials, VFX, Sequencer, and controller,
4498820	4503460	you'll have a whole new world of options for publishing games and experiences for Fortnite.
4504340	4509540	And it sounds to me a little bit like almost like kind of a Roblox type thing.
4509540	4515060	This also sounds very similar to, and I can't remember now the name of the platform that
4515060	4519540	they have, but it's also Unreal Engine based where you could build your own games out of
4519540	4521700	kind of assets and stuff that they had as well.
4522580	4527620	I don't know if that platform ever took off well, but I can imagine tying the Fortnite
4527620	4529940	brand to it could be interesting.
4529940	4536740	And also what exactly comes out of this, if they're going to try to like, you know, morph
4536740	4540180	Fortnite into kind of like a Roblox type of thing.
4540180	4542740	I mean, could be neat, I guess.
4544420	4550660	They're going to have all sorts of licensing problems like they did with like Roblox does
4550660	4552420	or just lets it run rampant.
4552420	4556260	But there's some interesting stuff coming out of like Roblox, at least.
4556820	4559860	I know my kids have been playing this game called Frontline.
4559860	4564660	That's kind of a Call of Duty Modern Warfare shooter game that's in there that doesn't
4564660	4566420	look like Roblox, which is kind of cool.
4567940	4572260	I'm curious to see what type of non-gaming art pieces because, you know, in Fortnite,
4572260	4576980	we've seen interesting things like the concerts, the launches of other media in there.
4576980	4580100	I always refer to the Ariana Grande concert, but it really like that was the thing that
4580100	4585540	got me to look at Fortnite and go, oh, wow, this really is kind of something different.
4585860	4587620	It's not just shooty bang bang.
4587620	4589780	It's like interactive art piece.
4589780	4594340	I'm excited to see that type of stuff from like indie artists that maybe tap into this
4594340	4595700	and use this a little bit.
4595700	4597140	I think it'd be very interesting.
4597140	4600420	Yeah, I'd be curious how it actually works, though.
4600420	4601620	Yeah, I would too.
4601620	4602900	Yeah, I'm very curious.
4602900	4607220	But also, and the reason why I set up the story kind of funky is because, of course,
4607220	4612580	Epic Games, Grandpa's always going to bring up ZZT, which I've brought up a lot on this
4612580	4615940	show, especially we talk about, you know, Tim Sweeney's start in the industry.
4615940	4621140	I'm not a fan of a lot of his shit now, but certainly back in the day in the 90s when
4621140	4623700	he was making ZZT, like that game was legendary.
4623700	4625460	And you might remember ZZT.
4625460	4626420	Why was it popular?
4626420	4631300	Because it brought this whole ZZT OOP object oriented programming language where you could
4631300	4632580	make your own games.
4632580	4636020	And we saw some really cool shit in ZZT back in the day.
4636020	4640820	And that's why to me, it's like, this is fascinating how this has come full circle.
4640820	4643620	And essentially, ZZT is coming to Fortnite.
4644180	4649540	Actually, I would love to see somebody build ZZT in Fortnite, and I think it'll happen.
4650100	4653460	But you still have a programming language.
4653460	4656100	It may not be ZZT OOP, but now it's unreal.
4656740	4658260	Probably like C++.
4658260	4662420	Yeah, that's now going to allow people to make their own stuff in Fortnite.
4662420	4664180	And it could be very interesting.
4664180	4668420	I've been watching a lot more Fortnite because Alan's been getting into it more.
4668420	4670100	He streams it occasionally.
4670100	4674100	He kind of prefers his mod games, but I watch over his shoulder sometimes.
4674100	4676020	And Fortnite, it's interesting.
4676020	4679060	It's still going after all this time.
4679060	4684580	And especially the no build mode is great for people like me that just think the building
4684580	4687060	adds something to the game that doesn't need to be there.
4687060	4690980	But yeah, it's great.
4690980	4695460	So I'm very curious to see what this Unreal editor brings, especially when it comes to
4695460	4696900	non-gaming experiences.
4696900	4698820	Yeah, it comes out in the 22nd.
4698820	4699780	I think it's for free.
4700020	4702580	So check it out, I guess, if you're interested.
4703220	4703720	All right.
4704660	4708980	Before I get to the next story, I noticed Dark Sakura's cat has entered the chat.
4708980	4711300	Would Midna care to comment on any of the stories tonight?
4712100	4713140	You have anything to say?
4715060	4715700	Put me down.
4718260	4719540	Did you hear the grunt?
4719540	4720180	I did.
4720180	4720740	I did.
4720740	4721300	That's great.
4723460	4727380	She's just mad because I picked her up and she's like, mother, no.
4727380	4727880	I tried to.
4728660	4729160	No.
4729480	4733480	I tried to pick up Cheddar earlier and I had him on cam for like two seconds, but he was
4733480	4734600	not having it.
4734600	4737960	He came in here and was like, meow, meow, meow.
4737960	4740040	I have plenty of pictures of Cheddar, let me tell you.
4740040	4743960	But oh, are you going to redo the movie at the start of the thing?
4744600	4749480	Yeah, I need to because I had that one where I had to fix a gap in it.
4750680	4756120	But I would like to expand and add in some of the community cats.
4756920	4758600	Make them pay points to put their cat in.
4758680	4759240	No, just kidding.
4760040	4761400	We could put a redeem like that.
4762600	4764360	I don't want you to have to update it all the time, though.
4764360	4765240	So, but yes.
4767080	4767880	That would be fine.
4767880	4770760	What I would do is I would take them for a month and implement them at the end of the
4770760	4771260	month.
4772040	4772540	Okay.
4773800	4774680	We could look into do it.
4774680	4777800	I was just going to say, just open it up and let the listeners submit their cats.
4777800	4782200	But if we want to make them pay points to do it, I'm sure people are sitting on thousands
4782200	4783640	upon thousands of points.
4784760	4786760	And I'm sure are happy to burn them.
4786840	4789800	So we'll see, because we don't have a lot of redeems on this channel.
4789800	4791240	It's just the way it's set up.
4791240	4792840	So, all right.
4792840	4796440	Now, we also need like our alert commands and stuff like that.
4796440	4798840	We definitely need to update some things.
4798840	4799640	A first?
4799640	4800280	First command?
4804680	4806200	All right, moving on.
4806200	4813320	Let's talk about a rumor, rumor, rumor of a Soul Calibur remaster potentially incoming.
4813320	4817400	You know, we haven't seen much with the Soul Calibur series since the sixth game, which
4817400	4819320	I feel like was a couple of years ago at this point.
4819320	4826440	But if rumors are to be believed, including Xbox game journalist Shifal Nick, I hope I
4826440	4831880	said that right, sorry, from exputer.com, I believe is the website, reporting that Bandai
4831880	4835640	Namco is preparing a remaster of the original Soul Calibur.
4835640	4841560	This was on the Xbox era podcast, but he's unsure if it's the original Soul Calibur or
4841560	4843960	is it a collection with one and two.
4844520	4850920	After all, Soul Calibur 2 was probably the most epic edition of the game, probably because
4850920	4852920	the GameCube version had Link.
4852920	4855240	So, I don't know if they would be able to keep any of that.
4855240	4859000	You might remember, you got to go way back, but the GameCube version had Link.
4859000	4865160	The Xbox version had a Tekken character, right?
4865160	4866040	Wasn't it?
4866040	4867640	I don't remember who the PlayStation.
4867640	4870600	I remember, oh, we lost Dark Sakura.
4870600	4875160	I remember the Xbox version had Spawn.
4875160	4876040	I remember that.
4877400	4879880	I don't remember who the PlayStation had.
4879880	4880600	Heihachi.
4880600	4881480	Was it Heihachi?
4881480	4881720	Okay.
4881720	4883160	I thought it was somebody from Tekken.
4883160	4883660	Yeah.
4884600	4885240	So, all right.
4886440	4887960	I thought we had Yoshimitsu in one.
4889240	4891560	He came later, not in Soul Calibur 2.
4891560	4895880	He was a character in, no, he's like in the original.
4895880	4897960	He was just always a playable character in the series.
4897960	4899640	I mean, I don't know why I was thinking that.
4899640	4904040	I meant the Star Wars characters.
4904040	4904680	They were four.
4904680	4905400	That was four.
4905400	4907080	They were the big land in four.
4907080	4907320	Yeah.
4907880	4910280	Three had the Assassin's Creed crossover.
4911080	4912840	Four was Star Wars.
4912840	4915880	Five, I don't remember.
4915880	4919000	Battle of War, or it was Kratos, I think, was in one of them.
4919000	4920440	Oh, you're right.
4922440	4925560	Was there even anyone on Xbox or was it just PlayStation that got
4925560	4926120	Kratos?
4927240	4929160	That might have been the PlayStation only one.
4929160	4931160	I think they only released five on PlayStation.
4933160	4934440	I could be wrong.
4934440	4935320	And then six.
4935320	4936040	I don't remember who...
4936040	4937320	Oh, six had the Witcher guy.
4937320	4939080	Geralt was in six.
4939960	4942120	So, interesting.
4942120	4942620	All right.
4943560	4947080	Let's move on and get to our next story.
4947080	4947960	So, Dark Sakura.
4947960	4956600	So, and this information is coming directly from the Federal Trade Commission.
4956600	4964600	So, nothing through any sort of lens other than what the FTC has said posted as of the
4964600	4965720	14th of this month.
4966840	4973880	So, they have finalized an order requiring Epic Games, as in, you know, our Fortnite
4973880	4982520	friends, to pay $245 million to consumers to settle charges that the company made using
4983080	4988680	dark patterns to trick players into making unwanted purchases and also letting underage
4989560	4995000	players also rack up purchases without parental involvement.
4995880	5002440	Basically, in the settlement, the FTC said that...
5003240	5005000	I'll just go ahead and read this.
5005000	5009080	Epic deployed a variety of design tricks known as dark patterns aimed at getting consumers
5009080	5012200	of all ages to make unintended in-game purchases.
5013720	5019400	Fortnite's counterintuitive, inconsistent, and confusing button configuration led players
5019400	5023480	to incur unwanted charges based on the press of a single button.
5023560	5028360	The company also made it easy for children to make purchases while playing Fortnite without
5028360	5030920	requiring any parental consent.
5030920	5036200	According to the FTC's complaint, Epic also locked the accounts of customers who disputed
5036200	5038520	unauthorized charges with their credit card companies.
5039640	5045400	They must pay $245 million, which will be used to provide refunds to consumers.
5046040	5052040	They also prohibit Epic from charging through dark patterns and otherwise
5054040	5055720	charging without affirmative consent.
5056760	5058760	So no more one button purchase.
5058760	5061320	It's like purchase, do you agree?
5061320	5062120	That kind of thing.
5063800	5069400	And it also bars Epic from blocking customers from accessing their accounts for disputing
5069400	5070440	unauthorized charges.
5073160	5076680	The commission voted four to zero to approve the complaint and order.
5077880	5079160	There's a separate settlement.
5079160	5081080	Also, this was announced in December.
5081880	5088120	Epic agreed to pay $275 million penalty to settle FTC allegations that the company violated
5088120	5090200	the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act.
5096280	5101480	Apparently, some data had been leaked involving underage players.
5102200	5109160	And also lists this for those who want, who may be involved or entitled to compensation.
5110040	5117560	If you believe you have been injured by Epic's practices, you can visit ftc.gov slash Fortnite.
5118520	5127560	So Federal Trade Commission site ftc.gov gov slash Fortnite and see if you're eligible
5127560	5133640	and see if you're eligible for any portion of this dispensation.
5134200	5139960	And this will probably be mostly, not exclusively, but mostly families with kids who racked up
5139960	5147960	purchases because, you know, the one touch purchasing and the tricks they do moving the
5147960	5151480	buttons around and things like that, you know, just all that.
5151480	5156840	So I'm kind of glad that we're creating some sort of standards for these games because
5156840	5162280	there's a lot of especially there's a lot of stuff out there with like an ad will come
5162280	5165640	up on the screen and you can't even like X out of the ad.
5165640	5167080	And it's very annoying.
5167080	5168760	And those aren't the Fortnite.
5168760	5171400	Those are the more like up and coming type of games and stuff.
5171400	5176920	So I'm kind of glad that this is going to set kind of a standard that at least these
5176920	5180840	larger studios have to go by that some of these nasty tricks are going to get in trouble
5180840	5181400	for.
5181400	5186200	So I think it was kind of needed for the industry, not just for Epic.
5187000	5194360	Well, and this really is going to set a precedence, too, and send a very clear message that no.
5194360	5196200	Yeah, we're not down with that.
5196200	5196700	Yeah.
5197160	5200680	So all right, let's move on.
5200680	5202200	And we're over to Loki.
5203320	5205640	So excited for this game to be coming out.
5205640	5208040	It's one of those games of 2023.
5208040	5209960	It's Square Enix's NFT game.
5209960	5210600	Oh, yeah.
5211240	5212440	Features here already.
5213400	5218920	It's Symbiogenesis, and they have the first official trailer come out for the game.
5220680	5222040	I don't know what it is.
5222040	5225560	I don't know what the game is because the trailer doesn't show anything.
5225560	5231080	It just has annoying music and it shows like some landscape thing.
5231080	5234680	To be fair, that's very typical for Square Enix trailers.
5234680	5239480	So like, I'm not going to razz Symbiogenesis for that when there's so much more we could
5239480	5240440	be critical of, right?
5241240	5248760	Yeah, so basically it says Square Enix has all the story chapters can be completed and
5248760	5251640	played to the end even without having character NFTs.
5252440	5257240	But those in-game purchases will arrive with a specific utility for those who hold the
5257240	5258600	NFT collectible art.
5258600	5263880	Players with character NFTs will be able to read unique stories, gain rank experience
5263880	5270120	points easily, create a replica of their character and gain additional NFT art when the missions
5270120	5271160	are cleared.
5271160	5275560	So some story elements will be withheld from players who do not purchase NFTs impacting
5275560	5277160	the overall gameplay experience.
5278680	5281560	And you know how we can make sure that we avoid all that?
5282360	5283160	Don't buy it.
5283160	5283880	Don't support it.
5283880	5284760	I mean, that's easy.
5284760	5287400	I have no interest in this game whatsoever.
5287400	5291800	So this is the wrong year to release this.
5291800	5296360	Actually, no, this is the right year to release this game so that it completely falls off
5296360	5298680	the radar and Babylon flops.
5298680	5300840	Like that's what's going to happen to this game.
5304760	5305240	That's it.
5305240	5306200	That's all I have to say.
5306200	5308200	I don't think this game deserves anything more than that.
5308200	5308700	So.
5309880	5310840	Exactly.
5310840	5311340	So.
5311720	5312440	All right.
5312440	5318680	If you want to see how a Square Enix president got fired, you can check this game out.
5318680	5320600	All right, moving on.
5321560	5327160	This is interesting to me, a new studio that is being set up and it's from former Blizzard
5327160	5329880	staff, and here's the thing.
5330440	5332600	Jay Allen Brock is one of the three.
5332600	5335480	And when I heard that he was involved with this, I was kind of like, Oh, I see.
5335480	5338760	He's trying to come back from a lot of it because you might remember Jay Allen Brock.
5338760	5341320	He was the guy that was kind of shamed out of Blizzard.
5341320	5342520	Like that's what it was really.
5342520	5347800	When all the discourse came up at Blizzard and how employees are being treated and all
5347800	5350440	that stuff, he really took the fall for a lot of that.
5351080	5353480	And you know, he needed to.
5353480	5356360	He was the face of the company for a lot of that.
5356520	5360360	Mike Morhaime had been gone for a little bit, and this guy wasn't exactly good with his
5360360	5363960	PR and the way that he gave speeches and stuff.
5363960	5365320	So he left.
5365320	5372120	And now he's teaming up with some other former Blizzard leads to make magic soup games.
5372120	5373880	But here's where it gets interesting.
5373880	5375640	Who are those other Blizzard leads?
5376360	5378520	One of them is Jen O'Neill.
5378520	5387480	Jen O'Neill was one of the two CEOs that came in to replace Jay Allen Brock.
5388920	5390200	That's interesting.
5390200	5393320	And that's so at first I kind of just was like, Oh, whatever.
5393320	5395320	He's making a new studio, you know, whatever.
5395320	5400200	And then when I saw that she's involved too, I was like, Whoa, that is a very interesting
5400200	5403160	pairing because she came in to replace him.
5403160	5410200	And you may recall she only stayed a year and a half, if that, and she left because
5410200	5416440	she found out her and Mikey Barra, who is now the sole Blizzard CEO, were not making
5416440	5417400	the same amount of money.
5418040	5420280	And she put her foot down and said, I'm being underpaid.
5420280	5421480	This is unfair.
5421480	5422200	And she left.
5422200	5426280	And it wasn't until she left that Blizzard offered to pay her the same thing.
5426280	5429240	And at that point she was basically like, kiss my ass.
5429240	5432520	And I don't blame her whatsoever for that.
5432600	5439000	But isn't it interesting that she is teaming up with Jay Allen Brock?
5440280	5442120	I just, I just find that fascinating.
5442120	5447960	I mean, it's not his decision to pay, you know, like, cause if they were getting paid
5447960	5450280	differently, like, is it his decision that he paid?
5450280	5451480	Well, he had nothing to do with it.
5451480	5454440	He, he, she came in after he was gone.
5454440	5454840	Right.
5454840	5455080	Yeah.
5455080	5456600	So I don't know.
5456600	5456920	Yeah.
5456920	5458040	It's, it's interesting.
5458040	5463000	And then the other person involved with this, John Donham, who did have a senior role at
5463000	5466280	Blizzard, I believe he's worked with like Amazon and some other companies as well.
5466920	5469240	O'Neill is going to be the studio CEO.
5470360	5474760	So, and she said in a statement, Jay, John, and I have similar ideas about the types of
5474760	5479000	games we want to make, and we're tightly aligned on company goals and principles.
5479000	5481160	So this was a natural fit for us.
5481160	5484760	We know the quality of our games will be a reflection of our team culture.
5484760	5488680	We're doing the work upfront to make sure we're fostering creativity, fully remote
5488680	5491240	collaboration, and a diversity of backgrounds.
5493160	5494920	It's interesting to me.
5494920	5500200	I mean, when she quit Blizzard, she made it sound like she wasn't coming back to the games
5500200	5503640	industry or that she was going to be advocating for women in the industry.
5503640	5507800	And it's not to say she hasn't done that in the last, you know, 18 months or whatever
5507800	5508600	since she's left.
5508600	5510120	It's just interesting.
5510440	5517640	I have no other word that she's coming back and it's with him to make this company, but
5517640	5519720	she's going to be the CEO this time.
5519720	5524200	So it's just, I'm curious to see what they make and what their game is that they're coming
5524200	5525000	up with.
5525000	5529560	If you, you know, to be fair, Jen O'Neill, when she was over, what was it?
5529560	5533480	Vicarious Visions was where she came from and they did that Diablo 2 remaster, which
5533480	5534280	was great.
5534280	5537480	And a lot of the remasters that company worked on were really good.
5538200	5541640	So, you know, she certainly has the resume.
5543400	5545160	It's going to be interesting.
5546040	5547720	I'm very interested to see what game they're making.
5547720	5551240	If they're going to try to make an RPG or something that's along the lines of what Blizzard
5551240	5553720	does or something completely different.
5555320	5556760	Questbuster says, this is what?
5556760	5559960	The second studio formed by former Blizzard devs.
5559960	5564120	There was one a few months ago working on a new RPG that was put together by former
5564120	5565000	WoW devs.
5565800	5568680	Yeah, wasn't Chris Metzen one of them?
5568680	5570280	And now isn't he back at Blizzard?
5571480	5573320	I thought I heard that was a thing recently.
5575400	5576440	That he had come back.
5579800	5582040	Let's see, I'm trying to find like the whole.
5583880	5588680	Oh, he returned to the company as a creative advisor in December 2022.
5589480	5591240	So he's only an advisor there.
5591800	5592300	Hmm.
5593720	5596760	Warchief Games was the studio that they added.
5596760	5598680	Oh, this is a whole other studio.
5598680	5599000	That's right.
5599000	5600120	There was Frost Giant Games.
5600120	5604840	I was thinking of the one of Warchief Games that did the tabletop or is going to be working
5604840	5605400	on that.
5605400	5606040	Very interesting.
5606040	5609320	A lot of these other studios coming out of the Blizzard stuff.
5609320	5610600	So we'll see.
5611320	5615480	Hard to hard to say much more until we see a single frame of footage of whatever it is
5615480	5617240	they're working on, and it'll be years.
5617240	5617880	So we'll see.
5618600	5619100	All right.
5619900	5624860	Well, even though that will take years, we can reflect on years past and some of the
5624860	5628860	great games that have come in years past with our next segment.
5639420	5644940	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull
5644940	5647180	out a classic and tell you about it.
5647260	5649900	It's time for the classic game of the week.
5651340	5658860	But in a twist, once a month, Dark Sakura picks a non-video game to spotlight this year
5658860	5659900	in 2023.
5659900	5660540	And what did you pick?
5661260	5662140	I picked Simon.
5663340	5673180	Um, Simon is a game that uses your short-term memory to earn points and win the game.
5673180	5675260	And it makes a fart noise at you when you do badly.
5675900	5681820	Um, it is, uh, it was released by Milton Bradley, now Hasbro.
5682700	5686300	And, uh, contrary to popular belief, it is not called Simon Says.
5686300	5689500	Simon Says is a game that you play on the playground.
5690220	5698780	Um, Simon is, it's got, um, four buttons and it plays things in a sequence and anyone who
5698780	5703180	has played Among Us knows that there is a version of Simon in Among Us as well.
5703180	5708620	Um, but, uh, you know, it'll like start with red, you hit red and then red, green, red,
5708620	5710220	green, and then red, green, green, red, green, green.
5710220	5714060	You know, you have to repeat it and you have to remember the sequence.
5714060	5719980	Um, but for, uh, a little bit more of, of the history behind this, basically you have
5719980	5724540	to play the sequence within the time limit that it gives you or else the game is over.
5725580	5730860	Um, but it was manufactured and published by Milton Bradley and then Hasbro.
5730860	5739100	Um, it was, uh, the coding is in Assembly, written by, uh, Charles Capps, who also taught
5739100	5742860	computer science at Temple University and wrote one of the first books on the theories
5742860	5744380	of computer programming.
5744380	5748300	It was launched in 1978 at Studio 54.
5749900	5750620	Yep.
5750620	5755500	In New York City, it was an immediate success and then it boomed all over pop culture.
5756140	5762540	Um, but yeah, it, uh, uh, to have a little bit of history about it, um, there was an
5762540	5769020	Atari game called Touch Me, and this was at the, uh, uh, uh, Music Operators of America
5769020	5771180	trade show in 1976.
5771180	5775820	And, uh, Ralph Baer and Howard Morrison were there.
5775820	5780460	They said, nice gameplay, terrible execution, visually boring, miserable rasping sounds.
5781180	5783100	So they bought the prototype.
5784060	5792140	Um, and, uh, sorry, the, the prototype, uh, I'm sorry for this was actually built on a
5792140	5797340	Texas Instruments TMS 1000 microcomputer chip, like many of the games, 1970s.
5797900	5802460	And then, um, Lenny Cope, who was also one of the partners there programmed the core
5802460	5804140	of the game that was called Follow Me.
5804860	5811020	Um, they developed the tones, they were inspired by the sounds of a bugle.
5811020	5816860	And then when they pitched the demo, um, uh, they had an eight by eight inch console and
5816860	5819900	they showed Milton Bradley and they changed the name to Simon.
5820620	5830540	Uh, Simon did debut 1978 at the retail price of $24 and 95 cents, which today, as I show
5830540	5831980	100 Matt, that's funny.
5831980	5834940	Studio 54, I'm sure people played it with their nose, if you know what I mean.
5835580	5838380	Um, no, Cher played it on the back of a white horse.
5838940	5846540	Um, anyway, uh, that would be the equivalent of $104 as of 2021.
5846540	5852300	So it was, it was expensive, but it became one of the top selling story, uh, stories,
5852300	5854060	toys for that holiday season.
5854860	5861580	And its patent is, uh, 4002, uh, sorry, 4 million, 2007 and 87.
5862220	5868460	Um, micro computer controlled game was, uh, it was granted its patent in 1980.
5869100	5874940	And then they did, uh, others that came out, you know, after that, um, I mean, I didn't
5874940	5878380	know anyone who didn't have a Simon at some point.
5878380	5879420	I had a Simon.
5880140	5886860	Um, I had several Simons, but we had, uh, they released like a pocket Simon and then
5886860	5887900	a super Simon.
5888460	5893580	I have only ever seen a super Simon once in the wild.
5895820	5901100	Um, super Simon, we'll get into that in a little bit, but at any rate, there have been
5901100	5905740	so many different variants since Hasbro acquired Milton Bradley in the 1980s.
5906540	5912780	Um, there was again, the super Simon was a hexagonal unit with six buttons, um, only
5912780	5914060	released in Europe.
5914060	5917260	Like I said, I've only seen one super Simon in person.
5917980	5923900	Uh, in 2000, there was Simon squared, which was a unit with the four buttons on one side
5923900	5925900	and a set of eight smaller buttons on the other.
5926460	5932620	2004, we had Simon sticks, which had two electronic sticks, like drumsticks and an emphasis on
5932620	5937580	the musical part of the game that, uh, different, like four levels of, uh, of game play.
5938220	5938860	I agree.
5938860	5941260	If there was no Simon, there would be no bop it.
5941260	5949100	Um, anyway, in 2005, we got Simon trickster also known as Simon tricks in, uh, Europe,
5949100	5951260	UK and Simon genius in Brazil.
5952060	5958060	It had four game modes that were similar to bop it and colored lenses instead of buttons.
5958620	5963660	Um, there's also of course, Simon classic mode, which plays up to 35 tones.
5963660	5967580	Simon bounces like Simon classic, but the colors of the lenses change.
5968300	5973420	Simon surprise is probably one of the most difficult ones.
5973420	5976460	Every lens is the same color and you have to memorize the location.
5977180	5982700	Uh, Simon rewind, uh, requires you to memorize the sequence backwards.
5983500	5989980	Um, and then you are paid a compliment after you, you finish on reaching five and 11 tones,
5989980	5992860	the game will say, awesome, nice, sweet respect.
5993500	5997740	Um, on 18, you get a victory melody that plays three times.
5998620	6006220	Um, and then in 2011, there was Simon flash, which in this one, you have a cube, uh, the
6006220	6010860	game has a four cube shaped electronic modules that the player must move around depending
6010860	6011660	on the game mode.
6012460	6017980	Um, 2013, they reinvented Simon one more time with Simon swipe.
6018700	6025100	Um, it has a circular unit that looks like a steering wheel and the four, it extended
6025100	6030380	from four buttons to eight touchscreen buttons, which are all flattened out on the unit and
6030380	6032620	you play by, you know, swiping.
6033420	6041900	And then there was Simon air in 2016, um, that used motion sensors, kind of like the,
6041900	6043660	the loops games.
6043740	6046780	And it had a solo classic multiplayer mode.
6046780	6054860	Um, and it tried to retain, um, it's, uh, aesthetic when they did a button version,
6054860	6056940	um, you know, kind of like the old school one.
6056940	6062860	And then there was Simon optics, which is a headset motion sensor game, but you know
6062860	6065260	what, let's go back to the old school.
6065980	6071820	Um, so the original Simon, like I said, four colored buttons, each with a different tone
6071820	6076620	when pressed or activated by the device and around in the game consists of the game lighting
6076620	6079420	up in the random order, and you have to mimic that order.
6080220	6086860	Um, and the name did come from the children's games, Simon says, but also based on Atari's
6086860	6089180	touch me arcade game from 1974.
6089980	6093660	Um, but this is just Simon.
6093660	6098700	So the tones were designed to always be harmonic, no matter the sequence.
6098700	6103980	And they consisted of an, a major triad and second inversion, like a trumpet fanfare.
6104940	6115660	So the blue, the blue was E the yellow was C sharp at red was a and green was E, but
6115660	6118620	it was an octave lower than what, uh, than the blue E.
6119420	6124940	Um, and some of them though, in 1978, they did use some alternative tones and they used
6124940	6126460	a B flat minor triad.
6127020	6128220	So blue was B flat.
6129260	6130380	Yellow was C sharp.
6130380	6135740	Red was F and green was, uh, uh, the lower octave B flat.
6136380	6141260	Um, and it had been re-released and redesigned and there's actually like a clear one.
6141980	6146140	Um, I know for me, it's always the original Simon.
6146780	6153260	Um, and then Nelsonic, which I have brought up last year as doing the, the, the watch
6153260	6153660	games.
6153660	6154300	Remember them?
6155260	6157740	Uh, they did a Simon wristwatch version.
6159900	6166780	So, um, the, you know, like I said, there were different shapes and different sizes
6166780	6169340	and different ways it came out.
6170140	6173100	The Simon swipe actually had a different note progression.
6173100	6181980	Um, it had blue was G yellow was C red was E and green was a high octave, uh, G.
6182940	6186140	Um, and there have been so many clones, so many clones.
6187020	6193580	Um, Atari re-released, uh, their handheld Touch Me in 1978 with multicolored buttons
6193580	6194460	and better sounds.
6195420	6204540	And, um, they, uh, there was Monkey C, Monkey Do that had oval shaped buttons.
6204540	6209420	Tiger electronics did copycats in 1979 with a transparent case and used buzzards.
6209420	6213180	It was also re-released by Sears as Follow Me, which was the original name.
6213820	6220780	Um, and then there was Copycat Jr. and Pocket Repeat by Tandy Computers as in Tandy from
6220780	6221500	Radio Shack.
6222460	6224700	Um, Castle Toys had Einstein.
6224700	6227020	Genius came out in Brazil in the eighties.
6227020	6229420	Space Echo was by some company.
6230220	6234620	Um, there was a DIY version out there that you could solder together.
6235420	6241500	Um, another DIY called Electronic Memory Game that was based on the Arm Cortex, uh, microcontrollers.
6242460	6247740	Uh, Game A mode on the second game in the Game & Watch handheld was Flagman.
6247740	6250860	Game B, uh, is the same, but it doesn't play in sequence.
6250860	6253820	You have a limited time to respond to where it lifts up.
6253820	6257740	It was R2D2 Ditto Droid, which is a Star Wars version.
6257740	6261020	And this was released by Tiger Electronics in 1987.
6261740	6267420	Uh, there's a side quest in the SNES and Game Boy Advance versions of Donkey Kong Country 3,
6267420	6272700	Dixie Kong's Double Trouble that had, that was called like Banana Birds and you had to
6272700	6274380	use the different buttons on your controller.
6275100	6283740	Uh, Soviet company Electronica, um, IE01 Evolga, which was almost an exact replica of Simon.
6283740	6286700	Oddworld Games had very similar puzzles.
6287500	6290460	Um, sequences also were on several other handhelds.
6290460	6292860	Just all kinds of Parker Brothers games, Atari.
6293420	6298300	There was a, there was a Toytronics Gotcha, which was very similar.
6299020	6307420	Um, and then, uh, the audio will, will play consistently and then some will actually kind
6307420	6307900	of cut down.
6307900	6314140	There's some that use dog sounds, cats, pigs, cows, xylophones, different kinds of space
6314140	6314540	sounds.
6315180	6319500	Um, but also it had a very big involvement in, uh, pop culture.
6320460	6327740	Um, in the book, the Tommyknockers that came out in 1987 by Stephen King, uh, someone had
6327740	6334940	left a Simon in the back seat of a reporter's car that activated itself and went into a
6334940	6338140	frenzy overheating and melting and scorched the seat.
6338780	6342220	The driver then knocks it to the floor before it goes up in flames.
6342940	6345900	Uh, and it's always sunny in Philadelphia.
6345900	6349740	Um, someone finds a Simon in the closet, uh, Little Miss Gamer.
6350460	6355980	Uh, Simon, uh, uh, actually had characters meeting up.
6356700	6362620	A family guy was in, American Dad, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, Cougar Town, Paranormal
6362620	6363020	Activity.
6363020	6365660	There was a possessed Simon that worked as a Ouija board.
6366220	6370860	A robot chicken, Dick Cheney's heart was replaced with a Simon, like as in Iron Man.
6372380	6373180	You remember, right?
6373900	6376460	No, I just, robot chicken players.
6376460	6380860	I mean, there was some in British T-shows, there's a mini game in Sabrina the Teenage
6380860	6382220	Witch for Game Boy Advance.
6382780	6387900	Uh, even in, uh, South Park, The Stick of Truth, you had to play Simon to rescue Randy
6387900	6389100	Marsh from an alien probe.
6389900	6395180	Uh, Quicktime Events, uh, The Island, Despicable Me, Veronica, which is a Spanish movie.
6395740	6397660	Uh, I'll just, all kinds of stuff.
6397660	6400460	And then of course, like I said, there was the sequence in Among Us.
6401340	6407100	Um, I like how it says it, in late 2020, the popular game Among Us featured a mini game
6407100	6409100	loosely based on the design of Simon.
6409100	6412780	However, most players mistakenly referred to it as Simon Says.
6414140	6416860	It's kind of a pet peeve, but I don't say too much about it.
6417420	6420940	Um, but yeah, it's, there you go.
6421820	6424700	Oh gosh, it was even in Heart to Heart, and I kind of remember this.
6425660	6430060	Um, it was in the season to be murdered, the Hearts play, uh, a fake Simon.
6431420	6437740	And then games magazine, uh, included Simon in their top 100 games of 1980 and called
6437740	6440300	it the original electronic follow the leader game.
6441260	6443740	Um, I have a question.
6443740	6446700	I know you've talked a lot about this and we want to get back into the news, but I'm
6446700	6450620	genuinely curious after looking at this video where some person in the camera is extremely
6450620	6453260	shaky and, uh, they're showing all their things.
6454300	6454860	Yeah, no, no, no.
6454860	6459660	I'm not even, I found a different one because they show the super Simon and I'm super curious
6459660	6462060	because I never played one of these, but you referenced it.
6462060	6462780	Like what?
6462780	6466620	I mean, this thing looks weird because there's like up and down colors.
6466620	6468540	What, what was super about super Simon?
6469580	6470700	Barely remember.
6470700	6475580	I was a kid and one of my friends who grew up in, in England had one.
6476620	6478940	Um, God, how old was I?
6478940	6480060	I have to think about it now.
6480700	6481980	Super Simon.
6481980	6484700	Um, yeah, I'm just trying to figure out.
6484700	6488540	It's all right if you don't remember, but this looks so different than the others.
6488540	6496620	It was, yeah, it was like this big long strip and yeah, I barely remember anything about
6496620	6497180	it.
6497180	6499420	I just remembered that one of my friends had it.
6500220	6501420	How old was I?
6501420	6503420	I had to have been like six.
6503420	6505580	I know they came out in the late seventies.
6505580	6507100	Super Simon came out in 79.
6508300	6514380	Um, and yeah, I just remembered not being very good at it, but we would play it together.
6514380	6515180	We would take turns.
6515740	6516620	Interesting.
6516620	6520700	Uh, I thought I liked this perspective too from bonds, double six and chat, and I don't
6520700	6525100	know if this is Simon influence or just the colors, but I thought this was interesting.
6525100	6530940	Bon's double six says those colors are imprinted into so many of the everyday visuals we deal
6530940	6534060	with controller button colors for video games.
6534060	6536940	And that is, that is a very good point.
6536940	6540300	I just so happen to have an Xbox series X controller right here.
6540300	6545900	And if you look at the buttons for X, Y, B, and A red, yellow, green, blue, just like
6545900	6546380	a Simon.
6546380	6550700	Now, granted, you could say that, well, it's the primary, it's the RGB and the primary
6550700	6553340	goes, but I mean, there's no purple, there's no orange.
6553900	6554700	I know, I know.
6554700	6555580	But you know what I mean?
6555580	6558220	Either it's primary light or primary, you know, um,
6558220	6562220	But look at the Japanese, um, SNES color scheme.
6562860	6566060	It had the colored buttons on it and the little logo on the side.
6566060	6566460	Yeah.
6566460	6568780	It was, it's, it was those colors.
6568780	6571340	I mean, I've sampled those colors directly for my channel.
6571340	6575260	You know, they are a red, yellow, blue, and green.
6576540	6582860	And so it's just, I don't know if it's an influence from Simon as much as it is an influence
6582860	6584460	of general aesthetics.
6585260	6590220	They're just colors that, well, I mean, red and green are actually opposites on the color
6590220	6595740	wheel, um, which means that side by side, they actually would cause a little bit of
6595740	6599100	mental discomfort, which true story.
6599100	6601580	That's why Freddy Krueger's sweater is red and green.
6602220	6603100	Oh, I didn't know that.
6603820	6604140	Yeah.
6604140	6605340	Gotta love Christmas.
6605340	6605820	All right.
6605820	6608860	Uh, those are the colors you see everywhere Christmas.
6608860	6609580	All right.
6609580	6613900	Anyway, um, Simon, long history for that game.
6614620	6618940	See it referenced not just in pop culture, but in other video games, including very recent
6618940	6619980	things like among us.
6619980	6620380	Yeah.
6620380	6621740	Huge influence to that game.
6621740	6623100	So, all right.
6623100	6626700	A great segment for the classic not video game game.
6627340	6627740	All right.
6627740	6631420	Let's travel around back to video games and talk about some other news going on in the
6631420	6633980	industry in a segment we call rapid fire news.
6633980	6634780	We'll go to Loki.
6635580	6635820	Yeah.
6635820	6639580	So start with March's PlayStation plus update.
6639580	6644700	It's going to be adding lots of big games, including, uh, ghost wire Tokyo, which we
6644700	6652060	just talked about was coming to Xbox, uh, rage to immortals, Phoenix rising and, uh, some
6652060	6653660	other stuff on there as well.
6653660	6654140	Let's see.
6655500	6658460	Um, uncharted legacy of thieves collection.
6658460	6659020	Pretty cool.
6659020	6662060	Rainbow six extraction, uh, life is strange.
6662060	6662860	True colors.
6662860	6665020	Life is strange to Dragon ball.
6665020	6669180	Z cock rot street fighter five championship edition.
6669180	6671660	Untitled goose game, uh, final fantasy type.
6671660	6672380	Oh, HD.
6672380	6673020	That's a game.
6673020	6673500	I forgot.
6673500	6678060	I bought, um, Neo the world ends with you and Haven.
6678700	6682620	And then of course three new classic PlayStation games coming as well.
6683500	6690140	I mean, only the best Ridge racer game ever Ridge racer type four, uh, April Academy two
6690140	6693580	for PSP and safe and filter dark mirror for PSP.
6694860	6696460	Seriously, Namco Bandai.
6697820	6700700	Why no, why no new Ridge racer game?
6700700	6701900	This makes me very sad.
6702460	6704140	Why, why do I have to wait so long?
6704700	6710460	Give us a full remaster of our four and, and find some way to bring in the jog con
6710460	6711260	compatibility.
6712060	6717500	Can we just have them sell the Ridge racer franchise to the team that makes Forza horizons,
6717500	6720460	please just do that.
6720460	6722300	Like that would be, make everybody happy.
6722940	6725260	Force has kind of made a name for itself at this point though.
6725260	6725980	So I don't know.
6725980	6727020	I don't know if you're interested.
6728140	6730620	I need to just re-listen to the R4 soundtrack.
6730620	6731900	It is so good.
6731900	6732400	Yeah.
6733420	6733920	All right.
6734540	6738860	And then, um, we've got some more news regarding the next silent Hill movie.
6738860	6741260	They have some of the cast, uh, picked out.
6741260	6742380	That's correct.
6742380	6749820	So now we're going to have Jeremy, um, Irvine as, I guess, James and, uh, Hannah, Emily
6749820	6755020	Anderson, who was in jigsaw, uh, who was going to be the co-star.
6755020	6757900	I'm not sure, uh, who she is playing though.
6761660	6764540	Or maybe they're leaving it open for her to play multiple roles.
6765180	6765900	Maybe, maybe.
6765900	6766380	Who knows?
6767260	6771020	Um, but that, that's interesting that they are, uh, yeah.
6771020	6775100	Taking this movie further and actually going to do it.
6775100	6776060	It sounds like so.
6776780	6777280	Yeah.
6777500	6780620	This was supposed to be pretty true to silent Hill two where it's the original movie.
6780620	6782540	And again, I liked the original movie.
6782540	6786540	Um, but it wasn't like it was kind of the plot of the first game.
6786540	6786780	Right.
6786780	6789340	But like, didn't they, they make some pretty big changes to it.
6789340	6789820	So I don't know.
6789820	6791900	It seems like they want to pyramid head in there.
6791900	6792300	Yeah.
6792300	6792780	Yeah.
6792780	6793500	There were a number.
6793500	6797900	I think, I think the, the, you know, pyramid, I'm actually going to quote
6797900	6799580	Shayla and start calling him pyramid guy.
6800300	6805340	Um, pyramid guy was, was in there, I think more for the sake of fan service.
6805900	6806860	Which is fine.
6806860	6812140	You have them there in the trailer that, and honestly, the, the purpose of the character
6812140	6817180	in silent Hill two was there as a punisher and executioner.
6817900	6822460	So it fits in and it was actually part of the town's mythos.
6822460	6827420	So I don't see any reason for it to not be in a non silent Hill related, you know, silent
6827420	6829020	Hill two related story.
6829020	6831660	So were they going to still make the second movie as canon?
6831660	6832780	Cause I don't even remember.
6832780	6834620	I never watched the second movie.
6834620	6835740	I watched the first one.
6835740	6836460	I love the first one.
6836460	6840300	You mean the one that was based off three, the 3d revelation or whatever it's called.
6840860	6845820	I liked that one because I liked Heather, Cheryl, Heather, Mason.
6845820	6847580	I thought there was a second silent Hill movie.
6847580	6850060	It was, it was that it was based off three.
6850060	6850380	Yeah.
6850380	6851260	Oh, okay.
6852220	6855420	And I really, I mean, it's not a great movie.
6855420	6861020	I'll admit that, but I like it because I silent Hill three is my favorite of the series.
6861020	6869500	I love seeing things from a, a rebellious, strong, young teenager, you know, who's going
6869500	6873020	out and thrown into this world and dealing with all of this shit.
6873020	6873520	Yeah.
6874060	6879980	I'm, I'm very curious to see what they do with the, this, you know, supposedly loyal
6879980	6881500	adaptation of silent Hill two.
6881500	6882060	We'll see.
6882060	6886300	We'll see, especially in a year where we know we're getting, you know, as Jason kind of
6886300	6888460	referenced in the intro, it's the year of silent Hill.
6888460	6892220	We already know, like they're working on all of these other projects, including a silent
6892220	6893180	Hill two remaster.
6893740	6899100	Oh, just add that to the fucking list from earlier in the show for this year.
6899100	6899600	Jesus.
6900220	6904300	What a year, like going from like, oh gosh, like years where it's like, can we please
6904300	6905420	get a new silent Hill game?
6905420	6908140	They're like, we're going to give you so many silent Hill games.
6908140	6908940	It's like, okay.
6908940	6913820	I can't believe when I was going over all those 20, 23 games earlier, I didn't name
6913820	6915020	a single silent Hill game.
6915660	6917100	Just add that to the list.
6917100	6921340	There's so much that we're going to forget about that's coming out like, oh yeah, that's
6921340	6921740	right.
6921740	6922540	That's a thing.
6922540	6926620	And some games are going to suffer because this year is too stacked.
6927900	6928940	That's the weird thing.
6928940	6929440	Fine.
6930780	6934220	I hope you all saved your PTO from during the pandemic because you're going to be burning
6934220	6935820	it on video games this year.
6935820	6939020	All right.
6940620	6940940	Let's see.
6940940	6943180	We have other rapid fire news, I think for Dark Sakura.
6944140	6944640	Yeah.
6945420	6949340	There is a new Tekken 8 trailer that has martial law coming back.
6950460	6952140	I love the character of martial law.
6952140	6954300	I think he looks way too yoked out in this though.
6956060	6960140	Like I, the thing I always liked about martial law and forest law is that they were the,
6960140	6963020	you know, the sleek Bruce Lee type, like almost completely.
6963980	6970780	And he's, he looks like someone took anabolic steroids and gave him a freaking, uh, IV full
6970780	6971280	of them.
6972780	6974220	He took whatever Bane's taking.
6975100	6980700	But I had to see this for myself on, uh, the YouTube that they released here, just to see
6980700	6981740	what you're talking about here.
6982460	6984220	Does he not look like super yoked?
6984220	6985340	Yeah, a little bit, a little bit.
6986140	6991980	But, but I always liked the character and, you know, I got out of Tekken right around,
6991980	6993340	I'd say Tekken 5.
6993340	6997260	Oh no, I hate that poppy, veiny look.
6999260	7001020	Not a fan, not a fan of that look.
7001020	7001740	I'm with you.
7001740	7002300	Love the character.
7002300	7002860	Don't love this.
7003500	7009420	But I've seen some really neat stuff in this and especially, you know, my man Jean looks
7009420	7010380	uh, pretty hot.
7011260	7016540	So I think that I would, this might be the one that gets me back into Tekken.
7016540	7017040	Yeah.
7018380	7020620	Ooh, Darts of Steel with an interesting point here.
7021180	7025980	I'm reminded of that BS story about Fei Long not being in Street Fighter 6.
7025980	7028060	I want to, I remember that whole drama.
7028620	7031580	I want to say martial law was the same kind of character.
7031580	7032080	Yeah.
7032700	7036300	So it's interesting that that BS story didn't follow over here, but anyway.
7037260	7037760	Yeah.
7038220	7044140	Well, I mean, I, I see, I don't really know what the difference would be.
7044140	7047580	I think there's got to be some other reason, but I don't think it has to do with like,
7048060	7053980	I mean, martial law and forest law started off kind of similar, but they also had like
7053980	7057340	the backstory of cooking and all this other stuff going on.
7057340	7058940	So maybe they were different enough.
7058940	7059440	Yeah.
7060140	7063980	Um, moving on to something very different than what we're used to, at least with the
7063980	7065500	pre-orders in the United States.
7065500	7069900	And that is a pre-order that Amazon Japan, a pre-order bonus that Amazon Japan is offering
7069900	7073020	for, excuse me, Zelda Tears of the Kingdom.
7073020	7075420	And that is a spoon and a fork.
7075420	7080700	Now, before you giggle at the concept of a spoon and fork being a pre-order item, there's
7080700	7084220	silverware seems to be a common theme with some Japanese pre-orders.
7084220	7088860	I remember when Dark Sakura had that game for the Dreamcast, the Saturn.
7089900	7090700	It was Counter Sakura.
7090700	7090940	That's right.
7090940	7093820	Came with like a whole fricking dish and everything else.
7093820	7097340	Um, and then I think I saw on Twitter, I think I just saw him in chat, uh, Shane.
7097340	7097660	Yeah.
7097660	7100860	Who said, uh, who's also waiting for the short message message game.
7100860	7107900	I want to say Shane had posted that a Pokemon out in Japan had a fork and a spoon too, scarlet
7107900	7108540	and violet.
7108540	7110460	So this isn't exactly unheard of.
7110460	7114940	It's just not something you often see in the U S as a pre-order bonus.
7114940	7120060	Sakura Taisen that came out, um, at the same time that that Cardcaptor Sakura game came
7120060	7122300	out also had a big bonus set like that.
7122300	7122620	Yeah.
7122620	7122860	Yeah.
7122860	7129420	My, my Cardcaptor Sakura came with, um, a pillowcase, a fork and a knife, a bowl and
7129420	7130460	a pillowcase cover.
7130940	7131420	A pillowcase.
7132380	7132860	Why not?
7133820	7134620	So why not?
7134620	7135100	Why not?
7135100	7136060	There you go.
7136060	7136300	All right.
7136300	7140540	Well, we'll check out some other, uh, limited edition releases because they love limited
7140540	7141980	edition releases in Japan.
7141980	7145900	There's always like every game you, you hear me read those release dates every week.
7145900	7147740	Like every other game has a limited edition.
7147740	7151660	We'll get into some of those, but first let's go to the U S and check out some, uh, releases

7232300	7235820	Heading to Japan and checking out some of the releases on the Nintendo switch at layer

7276460	7282380	guardians, demon purge, but also coming to the PlayStation five R type final three evolved
7282380	7285580	also getting a multilingual edition out in Japan this week.
7285580	7290540	And then that biohazard re four, cause remember they call the series biohazard over there.
7290540	7296620	What we call resident evil that is also coming out in Japan this week, uh, for the PlayStation
7296620	7296940	five.
7296940	7302780	And yes, there is a deluxe edition and a collector's edition also available in Japan.
7302780	7306300	I was just looking to see if that collector's edition includes a knife and a fork.
7306300	7309900	I'm sorry to say it does not, but it does look like it has a little crate.
7309900	7311980	This looks like one of those crates that sits on the map.
7311980	7318220	When you play against Wesker in a deadline that you get with this collector's edition
7318220	7319820	here for a resident evil.
7319820	7323740	So, but that's what can sit on the shelf.
7323740	7325820	Uh, there's also that whole Leon statue.
7325820	7326700	That's pretty cool.
7326700	7331020	I got to say, I mean, I have to have less physical stuff in my house, but that Leon
7331020	7332620	statue does look pretty cool.
7332620	7337500	So I have to say that going back to, um, the, uh, our type final three.
7337500	7338000	Yeah.
7338540	7345500	Um, apparently people name video games the way I named my art files final.
7345500	7349660	No, really the final, uh, the extra final, final part two, final part three.
7350620	7352700	They should just give up no more finals.
7353740	7358300	Um, interesting comment from, uh, DJ Roma S before we get to the UK dates, uh, asking
7358300	7364780	about the grim guardian games to didn't, they change the name to, uh, gal guardians.
7364780	7368940	Uh, they actually changed the name, you know, when I'm looking at this list of releases,
7368940	7371740	they are still, and this could be a Japan versus us thing.
7371740	7375260	Cause remember I am reading Japanese releases, but they actually show the
7375740	7378460	box art here still stating that it's grim guardians.
7378460	7383740	So I don't know if maybe, I don't know, but yeah, that's what it's showing the box art
7383740	7384060	there.
7384060	7387020	So it could be, it could be something that they just changed here.
7387020	7388140	Uh, I don't know.
7388140	7388640	Interesting.
7389980	7390460	Uh, moving on.
7390460	7391740	How about the UK Darzaka?
7393420	7398700	Um, let's see in the UK, I really a handful of things on the 21st for switch.
7398700	7400300	We have remnant from the ashes.
7400860	7405500	Also, um, the 23rd for the switch Ravens burger memory.
7406300	7409820	Uh, on PlayStation and switch, we have crazy chicken cart too.
7410460	7412300	On the 24th for switch.
7412300	7414460	I'm sorry for PlayStation and X-Box.
7414460	7416860	We have resident evil for remake steel book edition.
7417500	7421020	Um, for PlayStation, we have tournament boy commits tax evasion.
7421020	7422140	I just think that's the best name.
7422860	7427660	Um, and again, on the 24th, uh, for PlayStation and switch.
7427740	7433340	I'll tell you, uh, I'll tell you Risa three alchemist of the end and secret key.
7436460	7442380	All right, let's move on and get a few more stories and then maybe some phone calls.
7442380	7447020	If you want to call in later in the show over at vog network.com slash discord, you can
7447020	7451340	always join the green room and, uh, join the discord conversations throughout the week.
7451340	7454860	Uh, some of our stories tonight coming from the orange launch radio channel on discord,
7454860	7459180	cause you all like the, uh, the piece on, um, magic spoon games I talked about earlier.
7459180	7461180	No magic soup games, not magic spoon.
7461180	7463020	I'm getting confused with the Zelda pre-order.
7463020	7466140	Uh, but the magic soup games came from the, uh, discord.
7466140	7467260	Somebody had posted that the other night.
7467260	7469180	So, and I was like, Oh, I hadn't heard about this.
7469180	7472620	So, uh, thank you all who participate in our discord server throughout the week.
7472620	7474300	Vog network.com slash discord.
7474300	7477340	And you can call in by joining the green room in just a moment.
7477340	7478860	We still have about 10 minutes before we get there.
7478860	7480860	Cause we still have a few more stories.
7480860	7481660	Let's go to Loki.
7482540	7482780	Yeah.
7482780	7489980	So Blizzard has banned about 120,000 world of Warcraft, um, bot accounts that were using
7489980	7494540	the definite class of farm resources from wrath of the Lich King classic.
7494540	7499580	Um, they said, you know, we felt it was very important for the launch of wrath of the Lich
7499580	7504780	King classic to give anyone who wanted to hop in this iconic expansion, the ability to do so
7504780	7509820	with few barriers as possible, allowing every account to access the death night,
7509820	7513420	even if they did not meet the historical requirements, it was important.
7513420	7518460	However, now that the initial launch period is passed, we no longer wish to allow unrestricted
7518460	7524300	creation of death nights on brand new accounts is tempting, or it was an attempting vector
7524300	7529660	for malicious actors to use to get into the game and start exploiting very quickly.
7529660	7533260	So they're no longer allowing you to create a death night.
7533260	7536540	Um, from the get go, you still have to go through the process to do it.
7537340	7543100	The normal method, I guess to, you know, stop, stop the body counts, I guess.
7544140	7547500	This is funny because I remember doing this in classic wow.
7547500	7553100	Like when this game was live, I remember rolling death nights to have alt characters that could
7553100	7557020	do farming, like, you know, with stuff that maybe I don't have otherwise.
7557020	7562060	Like if I, my main character had, uh, herbalism, alchemy, maybe I have a death night who could
7562060	7564460	do mining and pick that up really fast.
7564540	7568140	But again, you had to have a character at level 55 in the original one.
7568140	7570780	So you, you had to go up through the ranks originally anyway.
7570780	7574060	So I mean, you're just kind of reverting back to that basically.
7574060	7574700	So yeah.
7575420	7576460	All right.
7576460	7577420	Dark Sakura.
7578780	7582700	This story makes me say, oh my God, shoes.
7584620	7587900	Um, well, they are definitely shoes.
7588780	7589260	Oh my God.
7590780	7592700	These shoes are 300 fucking dollars.
7592700	7593660	They probably are.
7594780	7599580	Well, funny enough, I was actually, when I was, I was playing midnight suns last night
7599580	7602300	and I just went right into shoes and I had no idea why.
7604060	7604560	Anyway.
7605020	7610940	Um, Red Wing, the company that makes, you know, boots, work boots and other boots and
7610940	7614460	everything did, um, Mario's boots.
7615820	7619580	Um, they are not for sale for the record.
7619580	7620700	They are not 500.
7620700	7622380	They're not 300 fucking dollars.
7623340	7632860	Um, but at any rate, um, the, uh, the company has on their website, a video for showing
7632860	7639900	how they transformed Mario's, uh, footwear into real world boots.
7639900	7642700	It has serene music and you witness the design.
7642700	7643020	It does.
7643020	7645180	Some of it may have just slipped through on the stream a little bit.
7645180	7646140	Sorry about that.
7646140	7647260	Let's get to the good stuff.
7647260	7648060	Show the shoes.
7648060	7648620	There we go.
7649580	7653420	Um, but at any rate, um, it's not the first time this has been done.
7653420	7661980	Um, uh, uh, Brooklyn, uh, art collective, MSCHF like mischief, uh, did a pair of, uh,
7661980	7663500	ballooning red boots.
7663500	7665900	Um, like were shown on Astro Boy.
7666780	7672460	And, uh, they were, they were purchased actually for $350.
7672700	7673580	Not bad.
7673580	7678460	And were worn by Lil Wayne, Lil Nas X, Coily Ray and Rich the Kid.
7679180	7685420	But I think that these Mario ones are not going to see the light of day as far as anything
7685420	7686380	the public can acquire.
7687340	7690140	But they kind of look comfortable.
7690780	7695180	Um, apparently, uh, DGRMS, I thought I saw this on Twitter and I'm loving the caption
7695180	7698300	on this, by the way, it says dramatic music and workshop sounds, uh, they're the whole
7698300	7698780	thing.
7698780	7702460	But DGRMS says, uh, the shoes are on display at Nintendo New York.
7702460	7705980	And I remember seeing some stuff on social media about they had a whole fanfare to unveil
7705980	7710060	some shoes that were just shoes that you can't buy.
7710940	7711980	Boots are not for sale.
7712860	7713580	Rob.
7713580	7713820	What?
7714380	7715660	Let's see some shirts.
7717100	7717500	Let's get them.
7717500	7720780	I've already been to New York and after five minutes, I was like, let's go.
7723660	7724140	All right.
7724860	7729260	Uh, moving on, uh, Loki with some, uh, not great news this week.
7729260	7729740	Yeah.
7729740	7736060	Unfortunately, um, we had the news that Lance Reddick had passed away and, you know, he
7736060	7743180	was 60 years old, a Hollywood actor who had played in many, um, big properties.
7743180	7748060	You know, The Wire, John Wick also had a significant role in Destiny 2.
7748940	7753740	Um, yeah, unfortunately he, he passed away this week.
7754060	7759580	And of course, along with that, you know, there was, um, tributes that were done by
7759580	7765100	Destiny players, uh, to, um, the fallen commander.
7765100	7768460	And I mean, it's, it's pretty cool to see.
7768460	7775260	And of course, you know, um, you know, lots of, uh, heartfelt responses from different
7775260	7781020	people and, you know, talking about him and everything far too young, I feel.
7781420	7785100	Yeah, um, 60, still really young, uh, all things considered.
7785100	7789980	And yeah, um, as I mentioned in chat there, uh, D'Artouzia says, I admit, I didn't know
7789980	7792540	he had a few video game roles, but still sad stuff.
7792540	7793020	Yeah.
7793020	7797500	And I think, um, as far as recent stuff goes, if I remember right, he was the, uh, guy that
7797500	7801340	played Wesker in the new Resident Evil series that was on Netflix.
7801340	7806300	Granted, wasn't, wasn't really well received and didn't get renewed because it's a Netflix
7806300	7809980	show, but he still, you know, definitely made an impression as, you know, a different
7810940	7815660	take on Wesker, uh, than maybe what people were used to, uh, from, uh, what's his names,
7815660	7817100	you know, vocal performances.
7817100	7822620	So, um, yeah, uh, SJ100Matt says he was so talented and such a good guy.
7822620	7826540	I followed him on Twitter and he always posted about his dogs and playing games.
7826540	7828940	Uh, Meech says he was in the new John Wick.
7828940	7831580	Sorry, if you mentioned it, I'm gaming some kind of zoning out.
7831580	7835340	No, I mean, definitely a lot of his media appearances he was definitely known for.
7835340	7836940	Um, so, um,
7837020	7839820	just remember him from the Eric Andre show.
7840620	7841120	Yeah.
7842060	7843580	This bit was great in that.
7843580	7846060	Oh, Shane pointing out another, uh, game that he was involved in.
7846060	7847100	I forgot about his role here.
7847100	7849420	He says, I'll always remember him from Fringe.
7849420	7850860	So there's a lot of, you know, folks.
7850860	7852060	Oh yes, for sure.
7852060	7852380	Yeah.
7852380	7852860	Fringe.
7852860	7853340	Awesome.
7853340	7856140	And saying, and the highly underrated Quantum Break.
7856700	7860460	Yeah, that game was, you know, did fall off the radar of a lot of people, but that was
7860460	7862540	a really impressive early Xbox One game.
7862540	7866540	So yeah, uh, Questbuster points out his character in Horizon Zero Dawn.
7867020	7869100	He's played a lot more than just the one in Destiny.
7869100	7871420	It's just that Destiny is the one that everybody's connected.
7871420	7875740	So, you know, you're able to kind of do those, uh, tributes, you know, when people pass away.
7875740	7881900	Hey, Bob, I knew you were talking about age and something, I actually looked this up for
7881900	7886060	a minute and you know that middle age is now considered 55 to 65.
7887500	7888060	Oh, wow.
7889100	7889900	That's good.
7889900	7890300	That's good.
7890300	7891340	I'm still not middle aged.
7891340	7891580	Good.
7893020	7893660	Me either.
7895100	7895980	All right.
7895980	7901500	Well, otherwise I still want to, you know, turn into, you know, Stalker Channing as the
7901500	7906780	ant, you know, in practical magic and just be cool and wake, wake people up for midnight
7906780	7907500	margaritas.
7908700	7909340	That would be me.
7909980	7912860	TigerClownChat says, I thought middle age was when you reached the 40s.
7912860	7913420	Not anymore.
7914140	7917180	Haven't you heard that old saying 40 is the new 20?
7917180	7917900	Wasn't what they say.
7917900	7918540	I don't know.
7918540	7925820	But anyway, they also say, like, I think that what is actually like back in, uh,
7926220	7933180	the 1920s old was 55 and now like new old is like 65.
7933180	7939180	I, yeah, I think that's absolutely what you're referring to is just because of science and
7939180	7941260	treatment of diseases and prevention.
7941980	7947180	People are able and less, you know, um, wars and so forth.
7947180	7950540	Not to say there isn't any, but less, uh, on a global scale.
7950540	7953900	Anyway, uh, the, the life expectancy is getting longer.
7954300	7959900	But anyway, apparently what, what defines the old age is when you hit, uh, the age that
7959900	7962220	is the common for, I think, 4% mortality.
7963660	7965580	Anyway, there's your science lesson.
7966700	7970940	Lance Riddick though, uh, by these standards was still middle age and far too young.
7970940	7973340	So, uh, a great loss for the industry.
7974140	7974700	All right.
7974700	7979420	Last story tonight, and this is usually the in, in memoriam stories would be the last
7979420	7983500	story, but I I'm purposely burying this one at the end of the show because I'm sick and
7983500	7987180	tired of talking about Call of Duty to be quite honest.
7987820	7989580	Call of Duty, more like it.
7989580	7996380	But we have, it is a big title in the industry and it has been dominating what's going on
7996380	8000220	with the Activision Blizzard acquisition and all that.
8000220	8006620	So what happened this week in the ongoing saga of Microsoft trying to get the regulators
8006620	8008780	to allow them to buy Activision Blizzard?
8008780	8013100	Microsoft signed another 10 year Call of Duty agreement.
8013660	8015900	Dark Soccer, this one may be interesting to you.
8015900	8019980	I know you're not a big Call of Duty player, but the agreement they signed was with an
8019980	8023500	international cloud gaming service called Boosteroid.
8024620	8025900	Oh, Boosteroid.
8025900	8026140	Yeah.
8026940	8027500	And the company-
8029500	8032460	I was, I really wanted to like Boosteroid.
8032460	8039820	I really, really wanted to, but the connection was so bad.
8039820	8040060	Yeah.
8040060	8042220	And it sounds like they're mainly overseas too.
8042380	8046060	Their development team is Ukraine based.
8046060	8047820	The software development team is Ukraine based.
8047820	8051020	So yeah, they're probably, it's probably a different experience in the UK than what
8051020	8051660	you had here.
8052380	8056700	But Boosteroid is the service that's going to be getting Call of Duty in a 10 year agreement
8056700	8057340	here.
8057340	8064140	So Microsoft is trying to sign these agreements to try to get the deal to close so that it
8064140	8068700	does, and also continue to make Sony look like they're getting an offer that they are
8068700	8070300	just refusing basically.
8070300	8071660	So interesting.
8072460	8081340	And kind of related, and this is very important, bignews.com, Disney Dreamlight Valley is finally
8081340	8082460	available on GeForce.
8083340	8086860	Oh, I didn't know it was not on there originally.
8086860	8087260	Interesting.
8087260	8088220	It wasn't for a little bit.
8088220	8091580	It just popped up on my available list and I already own it.
8092940	8093260	All right.
8094220	8094860	All right.
8094860	8098940	Well, that was all of the news we officially had slated for tonight, but I am going to
8098940	8100620	open things up for the listener round table.
8100620	8104540	If we have anyone that wants to call in, go for it over at vognetwork.com slash discord,
8104540	8105500	you join the green room.
8106140	8109420	Also, if you have any just general questions, maybe you're just feeling shy, you don't really
8109420	8110460	want to call, that's fine.
8110460	8111820	You can ask your questions in chat.
8112460	8114140	I always do a mailbag check.
8114140	8116620	I don't think I saw anything, but I will check in.
8116620	8120220	Participate at orangelaunchradio.com is the place to send emails.
8121100	8125980	I'm afraid that the dust bunnies in there have like formed entire warrens and they're
8125980	8127900	in competition with cobwebs.
8127900	8128540	And spam.
8131020	8136300	The, well, this, this, is that why the floor in there is all sticky and squishy?
8136300	8140140	There's a little bit of spam that, that lines the floor in there.
8140140	8140380	All right.
8141180	8143660	But not as bad as the old, uh, email account.
8143660	8149020	So, uh, Fanara in chat says, have you shared the D and D Easter egg?
8149020	8149980	I, what is that?
8149980	8150860	So cool.
8150860	8151420	What is this?
8151420	8152380	I don't, I actually don't know.
8153100	8160140	There is apparently a scene where the group in the movie is walking and across from them
8160140	8163260	is the cartoon D and D party.
8164140	8165020	Oh, that's funny.
8166140	8166540	Yeah.
8167500	8173500	Um, uh, Gwen sent me the picture and I will, uh, send it, send you the link.
8174060	8176780	Did that movie actually come out now or is that next week?
8176780	8178700	It's next week, I think.
8178700	8181260	Who wants to go see it with me at the end of the month?
8181260	8182380	Maybe I want to go.
8182380	8186300	They re-released it back into theaters, I think just this week, but everything everywhere
8186300	8187500	all at once is in theaters again.
8187500	8190380	I kind of want to see it, but, um, I didn't get to see it.
8190380	8192460	I didn't get to do it this weekend, so it'd have to be during the week.
8193100	8196380	But one of the places it's playing is the Roseville Galleria.
8196380	8200220	And so you can go upstairs to watch the movie and then downstairs to go to round one.
8200220	8202060	So just food for thought.
8202060	8205180	I sent you the, um, the picture, but you know what?
8205180	8208540	I'll go ahead and post, uh, the link in chat that Gwen gave me.
8209340	8211180	So there you go.
8211180	8213820	Now all of our friends can, can see it too.
8214380	8219500	Uh, Shane in chat says, I know nothing about D&D, but I want to see it for some reason.
8219500	8222140	Um, the previews look good.
8222700	8225420	Uh, and yeah, StarSakura, uh, boop the link there in chat.
8225420	8228620	I'm not going to show the picture on stream just because some people are very hypersensitive
8228620	8229420	about spoilers.
8229420	8231020	So I'm just gonna, you know, leave it at that.
8231020	8233900	You, you, you can click the link if you like, but I won't show it on stream for now.
8233900	8235260	We haven't already just told you.
8235260	8236140	Yeah, right.
8236140	8241180	Uh, as Joe 100 Matt says, speaking of emptying your wallet, have you seen the Tron Light
8241180	8243740	Cycle Run merch that they're going to have at Disney World?
8243740	8247020	Oh, is this the whole like custom figures?
8247020	8248140	Yes.
8248140	8249340	Give it to us.
8249340	8250860	We went into Disneyland.
8250860	8253580	It looks so, yeah, it does look so good.
8253580	8257580	Like you can make your own, cause of course the lightsabers work so well.
8257580	8257980	Yeah.
8257980	8264220	I, when, when am I going to be able to afford to go to Disney World?
8265260	8268700	We need like this whole underground complex and call it the grid.
8268700	8271180	Here's, here's the sad thing about this whole thing.
8272460	8276620	I'm gonna go on the Star Trek cruise out of Port Canaveral.
8277180	8280140	That's, you fly into Orlando to go to Port Canaveral.
8280140	8283180	Technically they have their own airport, but everybody says it's quicker if you just fly
8283180	8284380	into Orlando.
8284380	8287500	So we're gonna be in Florida in Orlando.
8288380	8291180	But like, and Bobby's even saying, go next February.
8291180	8295980	Here's the thing, but thinking it through, that means we would do, cause we wouldn't
8295980	8297660	just be able to do one day at Disney World.
8297660	8299020	We'd have to do like two or three.
8299580	8305580	So we do like three days at Disney World and then a seven day cruise or vice versa, a seven
8305580	8307740	day cruise and then three days at Disney World.
8308940	8310140	I don't know if I could handle it.
8310780	8311820	I want that jacket.
8313020	8314300	Bobby says, I've done it.
8314300	8314800	Dang.
8316540	8317040	All right.
8317740	8320620	So three days in the park and then relax on the cruise.
8320620	8321020	Maybe.
8321020	8321420	I don't know.
8321420	8323260	I gotta, I gotta think it through.
8323260	8324460	Like, I'm not gonna lie.
8324460	8325580	I'm fucking tempted.
8325580	8331260	And the fact that I have already paid for the cruise does mean that financially it might
8331260	8332700	be figureoutable.
8332700	8335340	I mean, technically we could always, Alan is coming to Dragon Con.
8335340	8338060	We can always go the week after Dragon Con, but then I'm going to be real tired after
8338060	8338620	Dragon Con.
8338620	8345820	So yeah, it's going to be, it's going to be, uh, it's going to be, I want to do it.
8345820	8346540	We'll just see.
8346540	8348460	Cause remember, Alan has to buy into this too.
8349020	8352700	And being separated from the cats for so long is, is rough.
8352700	8355660	But the cat sitting situation worked out this last time.
8355660	8361500	So, you know, it gives them a lot of, uh, uh, support in that department, I think.
8361500	8363900	But yeah, I really want to ride the Tron light cycle run.
8363900	8365260	I just don't know when I'll get out there.
8367340	8367840	We'll see.
8369660	8375420	Um, you know, honestly I've been getting enough reward points where I could probably book
8375420	8377340	a trip on reward points and make it happen.
8377340	8379580	I just have to figure out a time that works with my work schedule.
8380620	8381260	So we'll see.
8381900	8384300	You could come to Disneyland with me for my birthday.
8386540	8392140	You're unfortunately, I have an executive level presentation at work the week after
8392140	8392700	your birthday.
8393500	8393980	It's okay.
8394620	8395260	I'm sorry.
8396380	8399500	But that just means you have to go to Disneyland a second time and then we can go.
8401820	8407660	Well, um, I'll tell you what, I love when my friends meet me for Disneyland, but I also
8407660	8413020	do not mind going by myself at all because then I do the whole thing at my own pace.
8413020	8413520	Yeah.
8414860	8415660	I want to go.
8415660	8417740	I actually want to go to Disney world by myself.
8419020	8421260	Cause then you don't have to worry about anyone else.
8421260	8422620	Yeah, exactly.
8422620	8423260	Exactly.
8423260	8428460	And I'm like, I, I, I, people give me shit about it, but I don't like to be behind people
8428460	8429820	who are taller than me.
8429820	8431740	It just makes me feel nervous.
8431740	8436220	So I, I go into convention mode and weave through people and move around cause I like
8436220	8437580	to be able to see what's in front of me.
8438140	8442700	And like there, there's a lot of stuff that I would want to do and seriously do it by
8442700	8445500	myself so I can just do things the way I want to do them.
8445500	8446000	Yeah.
8446860	8449020	However, I've done Disneyland so many times it don't matter.
8450620	8451020	All right.
8451020	8454620	Um, I wanted to check in if there were any last minute stories while we wait to see if
8454620	8456700	there's any other comments that come in.
8456700	8458140	Um, but I'll check on last minute stories here.
8458700	8458940	Yeah.
8458940	8465820	There was a leak of a new Lego racing game that's coming out called Lego two K drive
8465820	8470700	and it was leaked by, um, having some screenshots of it being a show.
8470700	8477580	And I guess they're doing some sort of beta tests on the, like a PVP racing part of it,
8477580	8483020	but it looks sort of like a kind of set up like a Mario Kart type game.
8483660	8488780	And they've got different levels that are, I don't know if they're not really based off
8488780	8489500	of Lego sets.
8489500	8490940	It's just kind of different themes.
8490940	8496620	So you have like this runway roundabout that kind of has airplanes in it, rapid falls,
8496620	8503260	which kind of looks like a mountain, uh, swamp us, which is, you know, swamp, uh, cat, cat
8503260	8507420	scratch freeway, which has, it looks like a, like a cat tree in there.
8507420	8509020	And then it's like a race course.
8509020	8514940	I don't know if it has like a cat, like they did the new Jago movies, um, down on the farm,
8514940	8518780	which, you know, obviously it looks like a farm type thing, glazed overdrive.
8518780	8526540	It's got donuts and candy stuff everywhere and headless horsepower and chasm crossing.
8526540	8527500	So it looks pretty cool.
8528780	8529980	I'll play it when it comes out.
8529980	8531580	I like Mario Kart and I like Lego.
8531580	8532220	So of course.
8533820	8534220	All right.
8534940	8538780	Well with that, I believe we've reached the end of our show for tonight, but I want to
8538780	8542860	thank everybody for listening once again to Orange Lawns Radio, whether it was on the
8542860	8547900	podcast feed or live here at twitch.tv slash vog network on Sunday nights, we appreciate
8547900	8551740	you being a part of the experience and being a part of our family here on Sunday.
8551740	8553100	Thank you so much for being here.
8553100	8556140	And if you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Lawns Radio, tell a friend or two about
8556140	8559260	the show, help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice,
8559260	8564220	but we need more voices here to put out on air and a nice five star review on a site
8564220	8568620	like iTunes, Spotify, wherever it is, you found this podcast, those go an awful long
8568620	8570620	way, uh, you know, come join us.
8570620	8575900	We're on the road to a thousand weekly episodes, uh, coming up in, uh, next year.
8575900	8578140	So it's gonna be, gonna be something.
8578140	8583180	So, um, that right around the time that I may or may not go to Disney world and, uh,
8583180	8584700	the Star Trek cruise we'll see.
8584700	8586700	So, uh, but that is coming up.
8586700	8593180	So join us as we count the road to a thousand weekly episodes, 48 more to go after tonight.
8593180	8593680	All right.
8594380	8597500	With that, let's wrap it all up for tonight.
8597500	8601100	Dark Sakura, um, I know you're doing some streaming after the show tonight.
8601100	8602140	I hope you have some fun.
8602700	8605980	Sorry, I'm assuming you're swiffing tonight and, uh, yeetin.
8607180	8612380	Um, actually two of the team yeet may be showing up a little bit later.
8612380	8617020	Um, but if Gwen's down to play, I'm down to have Gwen in.
8617580	8620300	Might, might, might, might, one of my favorite people to play with.
8621020	8625580	And, uh, other than that, I'm gonna be an annoying killer.
8626460	8627100	Sounds good.
8627100	8631500	And if Gwen does play, I'm, I'm casting a protective bubble around Gwen because those
8631500	8634060	killers always pick on her and I hate to see it.
8634060	8635260	So I'm cast, I'm doing it.
8635260	8639500	I'm casting a protective bubble around Gwen so that she's not tunneled by killers tonight.
8639500	8640000	All right.
8640700	8641980	Have a good stream.
8641980	8642380	Bye.
8642380	8644460	I have, have fun storming the castle.
8644460	8645260	Will do.
8645260	8645900	I think it'll work.
8646540	8647740	It'll take a miracle.
8647740	8648380	Bye.
8648380	8648880	Bye.
8649500	8650140	All right.
8650140	8652300	Uh, Loki, your final thought for tonight?
8652300	8659660	My final thought is I, I pasted a link in chat for the Resident Evil 4 anime that is
8659660	8663900	apparently part of their marketing plan for the Resident Evil 4 game.
8663900	8665660	It's done by Nippon Animation.
8665660	8666620	It's ridiculous.
8668540	8669040	All right.
8670140	8674780	Uh, my final thought, I'm gonna probably go play some more Diablo 4 and get the most I
8674780	8678380	can out of this beta, see if I can get all the way to 25 during the beta.
8678380	8680300	Uh, but that's, that's it.
8680300	8683660	I'm having a great time and I can't wait to, uh, level another character next weekend.
8683660	8687100	So, um, and I'll be doing some streaming hopefully too.
8687180	8690060	Hopefully now that the network issues have stabilized a little bit, cause that's, I didn't
8690060	8693420	stream on Friday cause it took like an hour and a half to get in and even then you would
8693420	8697900	get disconnected sometimes, but it seems like they worked a lot of that out for Saturday,
8697900	8698300	Sunday.
8698300	8700940	So hooray, the beta is working as intended.
8700940	8701980	So that's good.
8701980	8704940	So hopefully next week it'll be a little more stable and I can do some streaming, but a
8704940	8708780	lot of people have been streaming it honestly, if you, uh, uh, want to check that out.
8708780	8711580	So that's good to do it for another episode of Orange Launch Radio.
8711580	8713420	Thank you all so much for being here.
8713420	8714380	Appreciate you all.
8714380	8716860	Have a wonderful week everybody and good night.
