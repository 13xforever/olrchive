00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,240
This week, I had a sudden desire to play Chrono Trigger on the Switch, which isn't

2
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:14,240
currently possible.

3
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,040
I could get out my 3DS and play it there, but the ergonomics of the Switch were a little

4
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:18,040
bit better for me.

5
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:21,460
I could play it on my phone, and might, since my 3DS's battery is very degraded.

6
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:22,880
Why am I talking about myself right now?

7
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,800
Because the Switch release is pretty likely to happen at some point, and it's a happier

8
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,440
thought than the rest of the news involving Square Enix right now.

9
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,440
This is the Remake-O-Rama update.

10
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:33,040
Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to get derailed by

11
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,240
daylight and talk about the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now on the show

12
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,280
where every gamer has a voice.

13
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:43,800
Hello, my friends out there on the internet.

14
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:48,120
Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

15
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:55,400
It is Orange Lounge Radio, and we are live once again after a week off with episode number

16
00:00:55,400 --> 00:01:03,520
950 of our show, a landmark number of sorts for tonight, March the 5th of 2023.

17
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,880
My name is Rob Roberts, and I'm here with you every week as are my co-hosts.

18
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:10,480
Say hello to Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.

19
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,680
What's up?

20
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,680
Hello.

21
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:17,600
Well, I say every week, but not last week, but that's my fault.

22
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,080
It wasn't a bad reason.

23
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,080
Yeah.

24
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,880
No, and as I've mentioned a few times on the show, I went on a cruise.

25
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:28,520
We were on a Star Trek themed cruise, and yeah, I'll tell you more about that in just

26
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:35,440
a minute, but unfortunately, the only downside to that is that by going on vacation and doing

27
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:39,840
a cruise and being in the airports and all that, Alan's feeling a little under weather

28
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,840
today.

29
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:44,900
We were supposed to meet Dark Sakura and one of our streamer friends who's in town, Nick

30
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:45,900
and Prince.

31
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,840
You and I both raid him a lot on our personal streams.

32
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,920
I'm sure a lot of our viewers are familiar with him at this point.

33
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,620
We were supposed to meet him for brunch today.

34
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:56,100
You got to meet him for brunch, but I didn't because we're erring on the side of Alan's

35
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,420
feeling a little under the weather.

36
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:01,660
It doesn't seem to be COVID yet, but we're just going to err on the side of caution.

37
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:07,380
And Nick seemed to appreciate that, so we just both hope that Alan gets to feeling better

38
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:09,060
soon and that you don't get it.

39
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,340
Yeah, for sure.

40
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:15,780
I completely realized there is a risk with doing fun things in the world, but we tried

41
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:16,780
our best.

42
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:17,780
We'll see.

43
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:18,780
We'll see what happens.

44
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:24,180
Maybe it could just be, you know, bodies are worn down from a week straight worth of partying

45
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:28,580
that honestly it could, it could just be a cold or something, you know, a little more,

46
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:32,680
a little more innocent, I suppose than what we've become used to over the last three years.

47
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:35,860
Are you aware that Brookfield's no longer has many loaves?

48
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:38,700
No, that's a tragedy.

49
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:42,980
It's an utter trash, but I did have a cranberry mimosa, so that was great.

50
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:43,980
That's good.

51
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:44,980
Did you get your soup?

52
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:49,260
No, I ended up because I made a whole bunch of soup yesterday and I'm going to eat that

53
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,380
up and then if I want, I'll go lemono, I'll go pick some up.

54
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,380
Yeah.

55
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:54,380
All right.

56
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:56,840
Well also say hello to a, I think also a fan of soup.

57
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,180
Say hello to Techmaster Loki.

58
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:59,180
Soup is good.

59
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,720
I've been known to have two soups in one meal.

60
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,720
Two soups?

61
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,140
That's an extra fancy meal.

62
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:06,140
Real raisin bran.

63
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:07,140
There's two soups.

64
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:09,180
Uh, what, what, what's your favorite soup?

65
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:12,540
Um, well, I like a good French onion soup.

66
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:13,540
Ah, oh.

67
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,100
On the cruise.

68
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:21,460
Cause you know, you get to eat in the main dining room and there's a French onion soup

69
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:22,460
that was so good.

70
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:23,460
Yeah.

71
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:25,380
That's one of my faves too.

72
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:28,600
But a good chicken tortilla, I think is always going to be one of my favorites.

73
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,340
And now creating a French onion soup.

74
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:31,340
My bad.

75
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:32,340
My bad.

76
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:33,340
My bad.

77
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:34,340
All right.

78
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:38,500
Well also say hello to all of you listening live as we do tape live every Sunday night

79
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:42,740
at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at the

80
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:47,500
voice of geeks network, twitch.tv slash a VOG network.

81
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:51,140
And you can chat along with our show if you're listening to us live over at twitch.tv slash

82
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:57,380
a VOG network where VX Jason XV chiming in on the soup says hot and sour soup is my jam.

83
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:59,140
I can't believe I forgot hot and sour soup.

84
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:00,140
That is the best.

85
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:01,140
Hot and sour soup is the best.

86
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,140
Yeah, I love it.

87
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:03,140
I love it.

88
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:04,140
But I, I,

89
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:07,260
Number one, avgolemono, number two, war wanton.

90
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:11,840
I do love war wanton and I know the vinegary part of hot and sour soup can really make

91
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,120
a hit and miss for people.

92
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:18,200
But when I'm sick, there's nothing I want more than hot and sour soup is number three.

93
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,200
So good.

94
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,200
Homemade chicken matzo soup.

95
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:25,480
The time potato soup is good too, especially for bacon.

96
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,100
I do love potato soup.

97
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:31,160
Since we're derailing this with soup, I will tell you about the soup I made.

98
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:37,640
Um, I, we had a rotisserie chicken and I keep a like vegetable scraps that are still good.

99
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:43,780
And I'll freeze them in, in my, uh, in my freezer and add them all into like a, a stock.

100
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:47,320
And so, but I didn't have very many, just like the ends of a couple of onions and like

101
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,320
a basil leaf.

102
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:54,040
So I threw that in there, threw in some fresh trimmings from my Rosemary Oregano thyme.

103
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:59,300
Um, and I took all the chicken off the rotisserie chicken and put that in the fridge.

104
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:06,240
And then I cooked down all the bones for about four hours into a really good, rich bone stock.

105
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,040
And then I strained all the bones out and threw all that away.

106
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:13,440
And I added in another thing of chicken stock that I happen to have because I needed it

107
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,440
loaded up.

108
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:19,320
So what is in this soup is a dark meat and white meat rotisserie chicken.

109
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,580
So it's nice and tender and not at all dry.

110
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:25,280
It's got charred leek.

111
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:29,000
And then the mirepoix that, you know, you have to have that first for soup it's, which

112
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,440
is onion, carrot and a celery.

113
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,600
And my soup is fucking delightful.

114
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,720
Now I want soup, but I did this to myself.

115
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,720
Congrats.

116
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,720
I played myself.

117
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:45,120
Um, so, uh, I make a good chicken soup.

118
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,140
No cereal is not soup.

119
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:50,360
On a, on a programming type of note.

120
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,840
So I did mention the Star Trek cruise.

121
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:53,840
That is where I was at.

122
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,220
And you might be wondering what the hell is a Star Trek cruise?

123
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,680
What makes it different than a regular cruise?

124
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,980
And the short answer is the celebrities in the shows, but the long answer, I'm going

125
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:04,260
to do a special stream here at VOG network.

126
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:07,400
We haven't been able to do a lot of special programming outside of Sunday nights, but

127
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,980
I really want to try to get correcting the course on that.

128
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:17,620
So Thursday here at VOG network at about five 30 Pacific eight 30 Eastern, um, captain Matt,

129
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:23,200
formerly of the starboard power coupling formerly, formerly grandpa Warcraft from courthouse,

130
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:26,660
who was also on the cruise with me and, and essentially was the one that got me to start

131
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:30,700
going on the cruise will be joining me for a special stream on Thursday night to talk

132
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,220
all about the cruise.

133
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:36,620
Even if you could give a shit about the star Trek cruise, we're going to play Overwatch

134
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:38,700
together live on stream.

135
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,420
He plays competitively.

136
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:49,260
I don't so it's, and if you've ever heard Matt and I interacting, you know, he can sometimes

137
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:51,700
get very frustrated with me when I'm a baddie.

138
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:54,160
So I'm sure it'll be fun for nothing else, but for that.

139
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,740
So check that out Thursday here at the voice geeks network, uh, we will, uh, remind you

140
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:02,920
on our discord server over at vog network.com slash discord.

141
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:07,620
Of course, before that show, uh, I think that's all the plugs out of the way, uh, before I

142
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:11,900
get to the kickoff topic tonight, which I'll ask Loki about in a minute, um, Loki, I do

143
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:16,460
want to ask about, cause it was noted in the chat that you're, you have some type of like

144
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:20,820
Jurassic park on rails shooter playing behind you live tonight, because you can see the

145
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:23,380
video when you watch us here at Twitch TV.

146
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:27,380
And I'm, I am even, I'm curious, I don't know this drastic park game that's playing behind

147
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:28,380
you.

148
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:32,180
I saw the logo, so I know it's drastic park and not some Dino world knockoff, but what,

149
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:33,280
what is this?

150
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,860
It is the staple of most modern arcades nowadays.

151
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:40,500
It's Jurassic park, the arcade by Roth reels.

152
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:43,760
It's it is an on a rail shooter, Jurassic park game.

153
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,760
Got it.

154
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:47,020
It's like my, my youngest son's favorite game at the arcade.

155
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:48,020
Is it?

156
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:49,020
Okay.

157
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:50,520
I was kind of curious why you picked that game.

158
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:55,560
You know, I w I was a little bummed to miss the shenanigans that a dark soccer Nick Prince

159
00:07:55,560 --> 00:08:00,060
were up to earlier today because the, the play, I guess it's okay for me to say that

160
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,480
cause you're, you're done now.

161
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:07,800
So it's not like listeners can go find you, but the, the place where they met up was Brookfield's,

162
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,620
the little restaurant in front of Roseville golf land.

163
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:14,400
And I was thinking, Oh, wouldn't it be a hoot if dark soccer and I went over to Roseville

164
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:22,420
golf land after and took some sad face movies on the show of our old stomping grounds instead

165
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:23,800
of Roseville golf land.

166
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,600
Oh, that's probably smart.

167
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:29,160
Um, and Nick was talking about having played that Minecraft game there, but we went to

168
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,160
target.

169
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,160
Oh, Tarshay.

170
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,160
Good times.

171
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,160
Did some adulting.

172
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:34,160
Oh my gosh.

173
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,160
Fun.

174
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,920
Well, I are sheets.

175
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:37,920
You know, what's funny.

176
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:40,760
I also had to do a target run before my cruise.

177
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,760
Thank God.

178
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:46,580
My sister lives in long beach and was able to play chauffeur because I did not pack the

179
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:50,320
guard for my Clippers.

180
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,280
So I had to go to target and get a cheap thing of Clippers, which we kind of needed a new

181
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:58,540
one anyway, which whatever, just because I forgot the guard and I didn't want, uh, Alan

182
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:03,360
has a big bushy beard, which is very handsome, but, um, I, mine will grow uneven.

183
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,840
It will be very ugly if I don't keep it, uh, uh, even so.

184
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,840
Yeah.

185
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,840
Yeah.

186
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:16,080
Well, um, one of the things though, is that, you know, that like the part of Roseville

187
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:23,960
closer to the, the freeway is like my old, my old stomping grounds, like used to shop

188
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,520
at that Trader Joe's over there.

189
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:31,000
Um, and so when I dropped Nick off, I actually went over there and went back to, it's called

190
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
the Oriental market.

191
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,400
It's very, very lots of good Filipino food.

192
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:38,360
Like you can get all kinds of frozen lumpia and everything.

193
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:42,040
And I bought Ube rolls and I'm super happy.

194
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,760
Is that in the same shopping center as Trader Joe's?

195
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,960
It's a bit down the street.

196
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,960
Okay.

197
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:51,600
Cause I was like, when I, when I was a kid growing up there, none of that was to say,

198
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,600
like it wasn't even Trader Joe's.

199
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,360
It was something else that I don't even remember what it was, but it wasn't Trader Joe's.

200
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,160
So it was just, yeah.

201
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,800
There were some things that were still there.

202
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:03,960
Like they were poor, like the same Starbucks is there, but I was happy.

203
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:08,480
The one thing, which was a chubby diner for the record, not a Starbucks, the thing that

204
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,720
makes me a little bit sad though, is that when I went in, the ladies working didn't

205
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:19,960
have on Filipino dramas, which are hilarious to watch if you don't understand the language.

206
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:20,960
I bet.

207
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,960
All right.

208
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:25,020
Well, let's get into some games and talk about some of the things from this week and maybe

209
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:26,560
some of the things we missed as well.

210
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,760
We'll invite your topics a little later on in the show.

211
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:32,340
I think most of our news tonight is from the past week, but if there's something we missed

212
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:35,520
from two weeks ago, you really want us to touch on, we'll get to that during the listener

213
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,180
round table a little bit later.

214
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:41,680
But for now, let's talk about the story we talk about every week, every week.

215
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:48,280
It's the ongoing soap opera that is the acquisition of Activision by Microsoft.

216
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:53,240
But there's some interesting developments this week that are worth talking about here.

217
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,240
Yes.

218
00:10:54,240 --> 00:11:01,320
According to Reuters, the European Commission is considered likely to approve the acquisition

219
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:04,160
of Activision Blizzard by Microsoft.

220
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:09,680
That's surprising actually, because I wonder what changed because all the predictions were

221
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,720
saying that they weren't going to approve that.

222
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,560
And I don't know if maybe some of the concessions or the Nintendo announcement or some of these

223
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:20,180
like Call of Duty, I'd be very curious.

224
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:22,040
And granted, I could have just missed some of this.

225
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:24,660
I've been out of the loop on the news, full disclosure.

226
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:29,600
Like when I was on the boat, I'm not sitting there reading Twitter or social, any form

227
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,660
of social media and keeping it on top of the gaming news.

228
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:34,940
I'm enjoying the cruise.

229
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:38,720
So I don't know if something swung the pendulum hard the other direction, but it's fascinating

230
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,160
to me that all of the needles were they're going to say no, they're going to say no.

231
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:46,560
And now it's they're going to say yes, because I think if they say yes, I think Europe was

232
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,120
more likely to say no than America, quite frankly.

233
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,120
I'm sorry.

234
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:56,520
Now I have Madeline Kahn in my head going, no, no, no, no, no, no, yes.

235
00:11:56,520 --> 00:12:01,520
I think it's probably they've been showing that, you know, they are committed to putting

236
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:05,360
their games out multi platform, like with these different deals that they're doing with

237
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:10,840
like Nvidia, Steam, Nintendo.

238
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:14,560
So it's I don't know.

239
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:20,140
I think it's probably some goodwill there, at least with making those moves and probably

240
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:21,140
further looking.

241
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:25,120
I mean, honestly, like if you look in the Sony, like they do the same stuff like we

242
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,800
like are you really going to say like that they don't pay for exclusives and stuff like

243
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,800
that?

244
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,800
Like they do that all the time.

245
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:32,800
Like in.

246
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,720
So it'd be interesting to see what comes out of that.

247
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,920
Speaking of which, one of the things that may come out of that is revealing what Sony

248
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:43,380
actually pays for exclusives because they are making deals with different companies

249
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:45,440
to bring games over there.

250
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:50,620
And part of that argument is that they are paying to have games not only on their service,

251
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:54,900
but also paying to keep them off of Game Pass.

252
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:58,840
Which you know, it kind of shows that they're being a little anti competitive, if you ask

253
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:02,320
me, or maybe they are being competitive, I don't know.

254
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,940
But it is interesting, especially like, I just think the whole back and forth with them

255
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:10,920
like saying, Well, you know, we just won't have the competitive advantage anymore.

256
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:15,480
It's like, really, like, if that, if that didn't go through, they would totally try

257
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:19,560
to buy Activision, they would do the same thing.

258
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:24,040
And of course, going along with that, you know, we still have Phil Spencer still downplaying

259
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:29,680
the whole acquisition thing saying basically that if, you know, it doesn't, you know, end

260
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:35,640
up going through that Xbox will still exist, you know, they're going to still be there.

261
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:40,560
You know, it's not some sort of linchpin for their long term plan or whatever, which is

262
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,560
true.

263
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:44,200
I mean, they've got tons of different publishers already.

264
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:50,240
Yeah, I just think it's all just strategic right now trying to get the acquisition to

265
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,640
go through and we'll see what actually happens.

266
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:57,520
What's developing in court, though, is very interesting.

267
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,520
That's for sure.

268
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:03,320
There's, you know, now it's the whole trying to get Sony to show their cards too, right?

269
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:08,840
It's I, I'm kind of surprised and I'm, you know, I'm going to be fully honest, I'm not

270
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:12,360
sure how this all works in civil court.

271
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,720
But I and I'm not a lawyer, right?

272
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:19,160
You know, so I'm fully willing to admit my ignorance, which a lot of people that talk

273
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,960
about video games aren't willing to do.

274
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,040
So I'm just putting that on the table up front.

275
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,040
Okay.

276
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:28,840
I would think that in a civil court, a judge could like gag order some of these secrets

277
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:31,560
that yes, they need to be discussed in the courtroom.

278
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:35,160
But there's going to be a gag order on it so that these secrets don't get released outside

279
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,160
the courtroom.

280
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,800
And I don't know if there's just a concern that somebody is going to leak it or what's

281
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,800
what's going on.

282
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:40,800
I mean,

283
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:46,160
could they I don't know if the European Union has like an equivalent of like, Freedom of

284
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:52,920
Information Act type requests or whatever, where you can do that, like to reveal the

285
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,400
secrets, I guess, if you will.

286
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:58,260
Yeah, but some secrets to I think about all the things that the former president's been

287
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:02,600
doing in court, and there's a lot of it and all the redacted documents that come out of

288
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,600
that granted.

289
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,880
Now, I do know a lot of that is criminal.

290
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:08,320
And because of who it involves, you know,

291
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,400
it's also ongoing, like, you know, stuff.

292
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:16,080
So like, if it's done, then that would probably be released.

293
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,080
I could see that.

294
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,720
It's like national security stuff.

295
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,940
I guess, yeah, video games are not national security, believe it or not.

296
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:28,240
So no matter what Sony and Microsoft, you believe they're not that important.

297
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:33,820
Do I mean, does the public I'm going to ask a really weird question here.

298
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:37,680
Does the public have a right to know what Sony's paying for this stuff?

299
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:42,480
I kind of think the public should know some of this stuff.

300
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,820
Like, you know, I don't think it changes anything at the end of the day.

301
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:48,800
It's not like somebody's gonna be like, well, I'm not gonna buy a PlayStation five because

302
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,960
Sony does this.

303
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:54,560
I kind of feel like some of this transparency ought to be out on the table.

304
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,560
I don't know.

305
00:15:55,560 --> 00:16:03,040
Yeah, because it gives the impression like, assuming that say you it's it's, I don't think

306
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:10,560
anyone's really thinking this like, you know, like with I don't know, like, basically, what

307
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:14,920
I'm saying is, like, if you take like a game, then put it like, if I'm picking a specific

308
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:19,400
platform to release it on, you could, you know, draw the conclusion like, well, I picked

309
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:23,840
the better platform to release it on, because I think this is a stronger platform overall.

310
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:28,400
But if you don't see that there's a money being exchanged, or how much money is being

311
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:32,940
exchanged, you might think, Oh, well, you know, this platform is just better.

312
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:36,160
That's why I mean, sure, they may have paid a little bit, but like, this platform is just

313
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,240
better because that's why they're that's why Square is choosing to release their games

314
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,820
on Sony's platform.

315
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:44,880
But if it ends up, it's like, Oh, yeah, but they're also getting like, $200 million or

316
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,800
I don't know, you know, just some stupid amount, like $20 million to release their

317
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:53,600
game on that platform that may all of a sudden kind of bring a little bit more clarity to

318
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,800
it, whether it's like, well, it's not really a better platform, it's just that they just

319
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,460
paid him a ton of money to do that.

320
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:04,340
So it's, it is important, I think, to have some of that transparency there, because yeah,

321
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:06,920
it does kind of skew things a bit.

322
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:10,240
You may think, Oh, well, it, you know, it's because they're good guys.

323
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:14,280
No, no, not necessarily.

324
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,040
Nobody's good in capitalism.

325
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,040
Nobody's

326
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,040
no, no.

327
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,040
Yeah.

328
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,040
And the game industry and all that stuff.

329
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,040
Yeah.

330
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,040
Um, let's see.

331
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,680
Let's get some comments from chat over twitch.tv slash a vog network.

332
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:29,680
DJ Rama S says Sony's dirty laundry is about to be aired and I am here for it.

333
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:33,240
There are a lot of people that seem to be bringing the marshmallows and the chocolate

334
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:36,120
and the graham crackers to what's about to happen in court.

335
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:39,420
I don't I mean, like, again, I just see it as like a transparency thing.

336
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:43,320
I don't I don't think Sony's gonna get raked over the coals for it.

337
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,120
Like, everybody's gonna forget about it.

338
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,100
It's gonna be just a little embarrassing.

339
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:52,000
Like they're, they're gonna have to show their ass figuratively and somewhat literally.

340
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,600
And it's gonna be a little embarrassing.

341
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,480
But at the end of the day, it's just an ass.

342
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,280
It's just business, right?

343
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:02,160
So we know they're probably paying an obscene questionable amount of money for this or this

344
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,180
would be under discussion in the first place.

345
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:06,600
That's kind of my take on it.

346
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,440
DJ Rama S also says it's crazy.

347
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:12,360
I know people that will sell their PS fours and fives if the deal goes through.

348
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,960
No, they're not gonna sell a play.

349
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:20,040
People say the wildest shit when you put a keyboard and a monitor in front of them.

350
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,800
People say the wildest shit.

351
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:22,600
You know what?

352
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,320
If they do it, I say buy it off of them, get a good deal.

353
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,440
I also offer half of what it's worth.

354
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:33,800
Who cares what a person like who cares what someone does with their console or not?

355
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:38,240
Like, do we really need to be in the loop if someone sells their console or buys a console or

356
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,120
like has an opinion on about something?

357
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,000
Like, I don't care.

358
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:41,800
It doesn't matter.

359
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,240
It does not matter at all.

360
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,520
Someone on the Internet has an opinion?

361
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,120
They're shouting this.

362
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,400
They're making threats like anybody cares.

363
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,640
Nobody cares.

364
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,040
Nobody, you know?

365
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:54,720
Sorry, Rama.

366
00:18:54,720 --> 00:19:01,000
I know you call them your friends, but it's just like a real friend will tell you when you're acting like a fool.

367
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,920
It's just it's it's bad.

368
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:06,680
Like, I don't know.

369
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:10,200
Like it to me, it's just it's like that scene at Jurassic Park.

370
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,200
See, no one cares.

371
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:11,960
No one cares.

372
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:14,440
You know, we shout it from the rooftop.

373
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,120
No one cares.

374
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:18,360
The only people that care, the other people, they're just like that.

375
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,640
So they can stick in their own little click and be stupid together.

376
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,360
I don't really care.

377
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:23,720
See, it's very.

378
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:24,680
Oh, go ahead.

379
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:29,360
I was going to say, like, there's literally nothing like like I always dog on like Nintendo.

380
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,560
Like there's literally nothing Nintendo could do.

381
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,680
OK, well, almost nothing Nintendo could do.

382
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:44,640
I mean, like if they came out and said, Hey, we hate all trans people and like burn in hell, everybody, then yeah, then I may be more, you know, motivated to sell my console that I have from them.

383
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,680
But like, yikes, hyperbole.

384
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:54,120
I mean, but like aside from that, like just business decisions, like if they purchase Konami or something like that, you know, good luck with them.

385
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:55,880
Like, I just wouldn't care.

386
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:59,000
Like, it wouldn't be anything that they could do.

387
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:05,000
Business wise, are you saying Nintendo could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and would never be held accountable for it?

388
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:08,480
I mean, that's what he's saying, isn't it?

389
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,680
I mean, I don't know, probably.

390
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:17,960
And unfortunately, as much disdain as I have for the reference I just made, he wasn't wrong.

391
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:18,680
Clearly.

392
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,640
That's like the one thing he wasn't wrong on.

393
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,120
It's just the insane idiots that follow him don't care.

394
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,920
So, you know, but they don't care about anything.

395
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,560
Anyway, back to chat comments.

396
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,360
Get us back on track.

397
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:37,160
Sia Tabiri says Hoegh Law, H-O-E-G Law on YouTube does a great job of going through some of the legal aspects of this.

398
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:38,600
Great.

399
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:39,920
I'll have to check that out.

400
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:44,440
Although I always prefer reading it as opposed to having to watch a 10 minute YouTube, but I get it.

401
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,400
It's 2023 and I need to stop being old.

402
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:57,520
Questbuster says, a side note, the EU is giving the deal its blessing due to the concessions being made, and Microsoft is apparently not expected to sell certain assets to make it happen.

403
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,840
But UK regulators are still concerned over the deal.

404
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,320
A ruling isn't expected until April.

405
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:11,880
Making a distinction here between EU and the UK, which remember, if you heard the word Brexit, those are two very different things right now.

406
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:15,680
So good clarification there on that.

407
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:19,920
And as Joan had a map mentions, personal information can be sealed.

408
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,360
Everything else is public record.

409
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,680
At least it should be.

410
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:27,400
That's that's we are talking about publicly traded companies.

411
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,520
That is a good perspective on that.

412
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,440
So thank you for that.

413
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:39,840
Questbuster says Sony's deals will make news like when people found out about how much Epic paid for their exclusives during their bout with Apple.

414
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:46,040
Oh, yeah, I remember there's a big spreadsheet from Epic that made the news and then it was like, wow, and then it was gone.

415
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:48,000
And I bet people hardly remember it.

416
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,520
And it's going to be the same thing with Sony is like, wow, it's your ass.

417
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:55,760
And then everybody will forget the next week because that's the way the Internet works.

418
00:21:55,760 --> 00:22:03,680
Just like anyone remember when, you know, PlayStation online was down for, you know, a couple months or whatever years ago, like anybody remember that?

419
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,560
Yes. Yes.

420
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:07,920
No, that was Sony showing hole when that happened.

421
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:15,040
That was that was the black hole of PlayStation Network when that whole thing happened and everybody forgot that.

422
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,320
So there it is.

423
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:22,400
Let's see, as Joe and Matt says, but this is all part of business.

424
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:27,160
If the roles were reversed, Microsoft will be making heck for Sony if they were buying ABK.

425
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:33,800
One difference I think Sony would not be as generous as Microsoft is with Call of Duty exclusivity.

426
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:37,120
And I know they would not absolutely not.

427
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,120
Absolutely not for sure.

428
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:48,200
So let's see, Zen Monkey 11 says, I said I wouldn't buy any more Xbox consoles after 360 and I still haven't.

429
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:52,000
I have an Xbox controller, though, and Game Pass, lol.

430
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:58,760
Well, that's not a total loss for Microsoft, but I think you're admitting to that in your own what you're saying there.

431
00:22:58,760 --> 00:22:59,760
So I'll leave it at that.

432
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:06,920
Mike Deff says console wars do exist and we're seeing it with all this ordeal, but we're not the soldiers fighting it.

433
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,800
We're just the innocent bystanders.

434
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:09,920
Interesting person.

435
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:12,800
The console wars these days sure aren't what it used to be.

436
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:19,720
I remember the I'm sure all of us old gamers remember the full page ads, Genesis does what Intend don't and all those things.

437
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:24,520
And it definitely feels like the console wars aren't fought by marketing teams anymore.

438
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:27,640
They're fought by social media people and YouTube people.

439
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,120
And it's exhausting.

440
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:35,200
Like now we all look at that and go, this is even more ridiculous than some of those game ads we used to see.

441
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:39,480
And let me tell you, there were some ridiculous magazine game ads back in the day.

442
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:42,400
If you've not seen any, there's a whole internet out there.

443
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,200
Go look at some of these ridiculous game ads and tell me what you think.

444
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:52,640
So Bobby Black Wolf also says they want Xbox to be a platform, not a console.

445
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:55,600
The fact you have Game Pass means they got what they wanted from you.

446
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,080
Yes.

447
00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:00,080
And Quest Buster says so much shade in those magazine ads.

448
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:03,040
I remember the Final Fantasy 7 ad that mocked cartridges.

449
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:08,120
Oh, yeah, it was always it was it was always something anyway.

450
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:08,560
All right.

451
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:16,240
Well, let's talk about the ads that worked on us as we talk about the video games that we've been playing this week in a segment called How Was Your Gaming Week?

452
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:16,920
Dark Soccer.

453
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:19,960
And if you want, you can do How Was Your Gaming two weeks because it has been a minute.

454
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,840
So Dark Soccer, how was your gaming week?

455
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,920
Well, it was the usual stuff.

456
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,480
There was some Dead by Daylight.

457
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:32,200
I tried to play Star Ocean, but my controllers kind of fucked up.

458
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:41,080
Like this that has served me well for like the last eight or nine years or no less than that, more like seven.

459
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,080
But anyway, it's been a while.

460
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:46,320
My right shoulder button's been out for a while and now it's making other buttons stick.

461
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,080
So I ordered another one.

462
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:54,800
And so I actually played Cult of the Lamb instead.

463
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,400
And it was it was nice revisiting Cult of the Lamb.

464
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:02,720
Have they done any content updates, patches, extra things to that game since the...

465
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:07,120
It's just that there's supposed to be a new a new DLC for it coming out.

466
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:07,800
Oh, cool.

467
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:14,120
So I'm hoping that it's it's going to be good.

468
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:17,520
Like they said, there's supposed to be like new buildings in the game that you can make.

469
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,320
So I'm still doing Dead by Daylight.

470
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,920
I hit Eerie four, which made me happy.

471
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,440
Um, thanks.

472
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:36,680
OK, and I made actually I made friends with somebody I bought stickers from on Etsy, who actually, for those who are watching, did this.

473
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,280
Oh, cute.

474
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:45,160
A little Susie and I have a pig that's at my at my desk at work and also did this.

475
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:49,000
Which is for the podcast, there's an artwork of the pig.

476
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,440
Yeah, but I bought some stickers and

477
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:58,120
the Kaim that my new friend has been swiffing with us.

478
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:02,280
So the the the team Yeet grows.

479
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:07,920
And what did I do?

480
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:11,680
I played some Midnight Suns, you know, kind of slowly easing my way back into it.

481
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:15,640
It's just being back to work has kind of broken my concentration for stuff.

482
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,800
So I'm like easing my brain back into things.

483
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:20,440
So, oh, yeah.

484
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:23,480
And I played a little bit more Beatlemania.

485
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:26,320
I love that table.

486
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:33,680
It's like the 1964 era of Beatles music, but it's done like one of those old school pinball tables.

487
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:40,280
It's got like the big curved end in the open play field and but with enough modern touches that it's really fresh.

488
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:47,320
And then we watched a thing, but I guess I'm talking about it later in the show, so I'll be quiet about it.

489
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:50,480
OK, fair enough. Yeah.

490
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:53,320
All right. Well, then with that, I'll go over to Loki.

491
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,880
How was your gaming week?

492
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,360
I just played Minecraft one edited video.

493
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:02,360
So like I had an episode come out on the 24th, I believe.

494
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,560
So my modded series and that was fun.

495
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:09,000
I built a starter house there

496
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,160
and then I've been working on

497
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,520
making flowers

498
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,600
in Minecraft.

499
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,240
OK. Oh, giant flowers.

500
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,720
All right.

501
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,960
I'll see what that's all about in your next video.

502
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:28,000
It's it's the new the new robot master.

503
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,080
Oh, actually, I'm sorry.

504
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:31,120
There was a whole lot of stuff that went on. OK.

505
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,440
So let me let me back up here.

506
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,560
So a few things.

507
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:40,120
So first off, I have my eight robot masters.

508
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,280
I part my series.

509
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:47,120
I'm building a Mega Man theme this on the season on the channel 64 S&P,

510
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:50,760
which is cool because I tried to pick like the beginning season.

511
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,320
I wanted to pick a unique

512
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:57,920
build theme style or whatever that nobody has done before,

513
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:02,440
because I knew like everybody picks like, you know, I do cyberpunk

514
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:05,800
or I'm going to do steampunk or cottage core or something like that.

515
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:09,040
So I was like, OK, Mega Man, no one's done Mega Man

516
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,120
because I've looked online.

517
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:12,320
All I see is like pixel art stuff that people copy.

518
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,720
No one's actually done Mega Man.

519
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:18,840
So I picked Mega Man and I have my eight robot masters

520
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:23,200
that commissioned and created custom robot masters based off of the mobs

521
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:23,880
in Minecraft.

522
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:26,120
So the second one I'm working on right now,

523
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:28,000
because I finished the area for the first one.

524
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,200
The second one is the axolotl woman.

525
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,200
And she is like super cute.

526
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:36,400
She's got like this robotic axolotl thing that looks really derpy.

527
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,960
Kind of almost looks like a duck billed platypus or something like that.

528
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,920
But her area has like giant flowers in it.

529
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:46,160
Originally, I was going to be basing it off of the hanging gardens of Babylon,

530
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,840
but then I put that together and it didn't quite look right.

531
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,480
It wasn't like robotic enough.

532
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:55,240
So I've started now with robotic flowers that are going to be basically

533
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:58,640
these giant solar arrays or solar panel arrays,

534
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:02,880
which look really cool, even though it took a week to put together.

535
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,040
But that aside,

536
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:07,560
so a couple of things happen while that was all going on.

537
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,040
So.

538
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,480
Mojang decided that, hey, we're going to put out some Mega Man X DLC for.

539
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,000
That's right.

540
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,120
Minecraft Bedrock.

541
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:21,320
So I was like, that sounds like an opportunity for me.

542
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:24,520
So I was like, OK, hey, hey, you like that DLC?

543
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:25,320
Well, guess what?

544
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:28,720
Like, I've been working on this stuff and it's also making me related.

545
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,600
And so I got, you know, some retweets and stuff like that.

546
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:34,320
A couple of the developers noticed as well.

547
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:38,120
Then they decided that they're going to do this new thing.

548
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:40,880
It's called a feature me Minecraft.

549
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,240
And what's the first theme that they pick?

550
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,400
It's Mega Man.

551
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:49,960
Who has Mega Man builds out the wazoo because he's been working on for six months?

552
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,080
This guy.

553
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:54,640
So it's going to there's a very good possibility

554
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,840
that I'll probably be featured on Minecraft's website here.

555
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,080
Oh, my God.

556
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:03,320
Finally, I'm so happy to see what have we been telling you

557
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,080
for the longest time.

558
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,160
You stick with it and there's going to be something

559
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:08,720
that finally comes through and helps you get that push in.

560
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,200
I know we'll see what that does.

561
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,120
I know we don't want to set the expectations too high,

562
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:16,040
but I mean, the fact that developers saw it, Loki, that's huge. That's huge.

563
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:19,400
Yeah. So like, yeah, it's pretty awesome.

564
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,360
So, yeah, I've been just plugging away at that stuff.

565
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:25,600
And I think I've got a good start, obviously,

566
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:28,560
because I've got some pretty big builds already that I've,

567
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:32,880
you know, captured in everything and, you know, tagged in that.

568
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,320
And there's not really I haven't really seen any other submissions

569
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,960
on Twitter yet.

570
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,800
And it ends in like 10 days.

571
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:43,000
So, I mean, oh, man, I'm so happy for you preemptively.

572
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:45,120
Maybe I need to calm down what.

573
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:48,440
But since that did come out during the week we were out, I'm kind of curious,

574
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:50,920
like, what are your thoughts in general on the Mega Man crossover?

575
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,560
Because it looks kind of cool.

576
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:55,320
Yeah, I'm like, I'm not a huge Minecraft guy like you are.

577
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,440
And I was like, oh, I should fire up Minecraft and check that out.

578
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,600
Yeah, it's they've been doing a lot of these

579
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:02,480
like different things where they'll have maps that they make

580
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,680
they're like DLCs, but it's basically maps that they make

581
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,960
that have different like gameplay like.

582
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:10,680
So they did one not that long ago of like Sonic.

583
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:14,240
And it actually plays a bit like Sonic, like you're running

584
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,560
really fast and stuff like that.

585
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:19,720
The Mega Man X one, I think, is similar to Mega Man X as well.

586
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:22,240
I think you can actually like shoot

587
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:25,160
your Buster and like even like a fight.

588
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:27,320
Some of the enemies of I haven't actually played the X.

589
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:30,760
I don't play a lot of bedrock, but I may have to check it out.

590
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:31,960
It looks pretty cool.

591
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:34,680
And the aesthetic was definitely, you know, Mega Man.

592
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,840
So I don't know.

593
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:40,120
I don't know how many of like the stages they recreated in there as well.

594
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,680
And that'd be kind of interesting because it's kind of 2D.

595
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,560
I'm not sure if they like fix the camera angles.

596
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,520
So it's like side scrolling

597
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:48,720
because in the trailer kind of look like is a little mix of both.

598
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,320
So maybe.

599
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:53,960
But I know all the updates that they've been doing for like 120 and stuff.

600
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:56,480
They're supposed to be coming out, I imagine pretty soon.

601
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,960
Having kind of based on like

602
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,200
adding more robust

603
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,960
customization for these map packs, because I mean,

604
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:07,680
that's really where their bread and butter is with that.

605
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:10,360
I mean, because they're not making money off the Java version of Minecraft.

606
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:13,000
You buy it once, like 10 years ago, and then that's it.

607
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:19,600
It's all the map and, you know, DLC and custom.

608
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:23,920
All sorts of things on their marketplace, on the bedrock side of things,

609
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:26,080
that's basically, you know, all the mobile platforms,

610
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:29,120
all the console platforms and, you know, PC as well.

611
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,520
But I mean, I get it. I get it.

612
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:34,680
So yeah, it'll be interesting to see what happens with that.

613
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,800
The very least, I got a few people looking at stuff.

614
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:41,240
I mean, like, I just think it's like you're like, you know, 2023,

615
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:43,920
like who actually goes out to the Minecraft website?

616
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,200
Like, I don't know.

617
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,880
So we'll see if they feature in like surprise different videos and stuff.

618
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,520
I mean, it'd be cool.

619
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,040
At least they'll be on there now.

620
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:54,400
So it also puts you in their orbit.

621
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,880
And that's true.

622
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,720
Yeah, that's that's the other important thing, too.

623
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:00,480
It gets you noticed by the people that can help elevate you.

624
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,360
It's it's I again, I'm trying not to put the cart before the horse.

625
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,240
Let's see what happens.

626
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:07,160
But I will I'm going to check your Twitter.

627
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:10,400
I'm not as good at checking Twitter

628
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,960
as I used to be for reasons I've talked about prior on this show.

629
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,720
I'm a little more on the Mastodon bandwagon at this point, but I'm

630
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:19,800
I will make it a point to check your Twitter regularly

631
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:22,000
to see what happens of this, because I'm dying to know.

632
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:25,720
Yeah, I mean, it's got was it the post that I responded

633
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:28,000
to their build challenge tweet.

634
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,400
It's got about 4100 views on it and like 85 likes.

635
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:35,080
Oh, that's that's great.

636
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,240
So, yeah, it's not bad.

637
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:39,560
OK. All right. All right.

638
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:44,080
Well, Loki's soon going to be the next big YouTuber and he's going to

639
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,040
going to say, fuck this show.

640
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,000
I'm big timer now.

641
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,720
No, I'm kidding. He wouldn't. I know he wouldn't. All right.

642
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:53,840
All right. Hey, done, done, done, done.

643
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:57,280
All right. Moving on, I'll talk quickly.

644
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:59,000
I'm assuming that's it for your gaming week.

645
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,480
I mean, yeah, that's it.

646
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:03,520
That's a pretty difficult thing to follow up my gaming week.

647
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:05,040
I didn't play a lot of games this week.

648
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:08,280
Y'all know why I was focusing on just having a good time on the boat

649
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,120
and being social.

650
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:11,720
I met a lot of new people, but we'll get into that on Thursday.

651
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:16,440
But when I got home, because we've been home since Friday,

652
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,600
it was a Friday to Friday cruise.

653
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,360
So we've been home since Friday.

654
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:21,920
I have been playing quite a bit of Diablo three.

655
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,440
Yep, I'm back on that.

656
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:28,040
But because they put out a brand new season last week while I was out of town.

657
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:31,560
So season twenty eight started and the big new thing was season

658
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,680
twenty eight is that they have this new altar.

659
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:36,520
So they have like a talent progression thing on the altar,

660
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:40,240
which is similar to what Diablo four has in store.

661
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:43,480
So it's a little bit of a tie in to Diablo four's release because this

662
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,960
they haven't said this is the last season.

663
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:49,160
But my assumption is season 30

664
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:53,160
will probably be like a good number for them to end on,

665
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:54,880
which would be like that forever.

666
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:58,320
So they'll find a mechanic that they can run perpetually at that point.

667
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:01,000
So they're probably getting closer and closer to that.

668
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,880
But I am having fun with Diablo three.

669
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,680
Some of the builds have changed a lot.

670
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:06,040
It's kind of added some new things.

671
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:10,560
It's really fast to level now because the first talent you get doubles

672
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:11,760
the massacre bonus.

673
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:15,240
What's called is when you kill a lot of enemies in succession.

674
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:19,120
And so if you just kind of grind these certain maps, you can level up very fast.

675
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:21,200
So, yeah, I've just been enjoying Diablo three.

676
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:24,120
But honestly, that's like the only game I've really played since I got back.

677
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:27,720
Oh, I did play one round of Dead by Daylight last night, one round

678
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,520
to get my challenge done.

679
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:33,160
I had to sabo four hooks and get chased as Kate Denson.

680
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:36,840
But I was up against a Wesker who couldn't chase and never chase

681
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:39,240
me the entire match.

682
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:41,080
So I saboed my hooks, though.

683
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:43,600
Yeah, it was a baby, but that's OK.

684
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,160
When I see babies, you know what I do?

685
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,840
I don't teabag. I just leave the fucking match.

686
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:52,160
That's what I do when I see babies.

687
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:55,320
I've noticed, though, like a lot of baby killers these days.

688
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,120
Yeah. And I'm a baby killer, too.

689
00:35:57,120 --> 00:36:02,440
So, well, I mean, but I'm more like my thing is like

690
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:06,640
like I've seen them do the camping crap.

691
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,600
Oh, so I will stay afterwards.

692
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,360
And if there if there's something I can communicate with,

693
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:15,360
I will usually let them have it.

694
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:19,880
This this Wesker tried to camp the final hook after the exits were open,

695
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,640
but actually allowed.

696
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:25,000
Actually, he did get one of the survivors out because they fucked around

697
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:29,760
and found out and they they got slammed into the exit gate.

698
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,320
They forgot that Wesker can slam you into the exit gate.

699
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,680
That was and that was not the play.

700
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:36,800
They fucked around. They found out. So.

701
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:39,640
Exactly. You know, but you know what I say?

702
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:43,920
You know the when the gates are open, all bets are off. Yeah. Yeah.

703
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:47,080
So anyway, that was really it for my gaming week.

704
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:49,000
You know, another big thing that I missed this week,

705
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,440
No Man's Sky put out a new expedition.

706
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,880
I do plan to check that out.

707
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,840
I'm going to stream that on Tuesday on my personal channel for a little bit.

708
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,760
But yeah, otherwise,

709
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:01,320
I didn't get it.

710
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:06,760
That's the first time that I've ever missed a No Man's Sky Twitch drops campaign.

711
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:10,640
I've been I've collected every reward from every other Twitch campaign.

712
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:13,800
I missed this one completely because I was on a boat.

713
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,040
So that's that.

714
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:18,760
So before we get anything to be sorry.

715
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,920
No, it really isn't. It really isn't.

716
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:23,800
And I'll tell you more on Thursday. I'm on a boat.

717
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:26,480
Yeah. Yeah. I'll tell you more on Thursday.

718
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,400
Just the celebrities they had this year were great.

719
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,520
So personable, approachable.

720
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:32,920
Like I'll give you a little tease.

721
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:36,760
I know you you interviewed Todd Stashwick on a podcast

722
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,440
some time ago and have kept in touch.

723
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:40,560
He was extremely well received by the crowd.

724
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:44,440
He did a great job with like he introduced the new episode of Picard,

725
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,880
which we got to watch in a big group.

726
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:49,480
And it was it was like being at the Rocky Horror Picture Show.

727
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:51,360
But Star Trek, it was great.

728
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:53,640
And like, I'm not going to spoil anything that happened in the episode,

729
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:56,840
but I will just say there is there is Crusher

730
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:59,360
and there's a doctor who's not as likable.

731
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:03,320
And when the doctor who's not as likable showed up, somebody in the back went,

732
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:06,520
bitch, everybody started laughing.

733
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:10,160
So it's like Pulaski.

734
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,440
No, no, no. It's not Pulaski.

735
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,760
It's because it's Pulaski.

736
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,320
No, no, it's somebody completely different.

737
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,600
So again, I don't want to spoil.

738
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:20,720
So, oh, no, no, it's I don't think you would know it's different.

739
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,080
So anyway, I'll just leave it at that.

740
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,800
For those that are watching Picard, you'll get it.

741
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,840
For those that aren't, you won't. And that's the point.

742
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,800
But it was really fun to watch that at a crowd.

743
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:33,960
And I will say the last night of the cruise,

744
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:37,520
Tawny Newsome, who voices Mariner on Lower Decks,

745
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:40,720
she is on fire with her improv.

746
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:41,920
She's so good.

747
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,720
But she was a late add to the cruise because she was the other one

748
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,400
they added when Kate Mulgrew backed out.

749
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:50,400
So when Kate Mulgrew had to back out, they added Shatner and Tawny Newsome.

750
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:52,360
Yay. Tawny Newsome.

751
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:54,840
You can tell that they must have went to her and said,

752
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:57,480
what event do you want to host on the boat?

753
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:59,600
You can do anything you want. What do you want to do?

754
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:02,960
So the last night of the cruise, I went to a Beyonce

755
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:06,240
Renaissance album dance party hosted by Tawny Newsome.

756
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,880
That sounded amazing.

757
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:13,240
I will treasure those types of moments forever.

758
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:18,360
That is it was it was everything like I literally had to sit down and go.

759
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,280
Is this real life?

760
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,600
This is incredible.

761
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,640
So more stories like that on Thursday.

762
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:24,960
I'll leave you with that tease.

763
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,280
So that's pretty awesome.

764
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,800
Also, I will mention I forgot

765
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:32,840
I was going to bring this up on the toss call with Bobby Black Wolf,

766
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:35,240
but we can talk about it more in depth next week.

767
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:37,480
But I will just also confirm

768
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:41,240
Bobby and myself will be at Dragon Con 2023.

769
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:42,400
I mean, no surprise there, right?

770
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,160
You kind of knew that was coming.

771
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:47,280
Just confirming we are both going to be professional

772
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:50,800
attending professionals once again, which means we will have a variety of panels

773
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:54,400
that you can come watch and do all the good stuff with. And

774
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:57,680
I know this is going to 100 percent happen

775
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:01,080
because the flights have been booked as of this last week.

776
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:04,560
Alan is going to his first Dragon Con this year.

777
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:08,040
So it's not just and it's not just me going, it's Alan going.

778
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:11,000
And I'm I'm trying to talk Alan into doing a panel.

779
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:15,440
But he's he he's not there yet mentally, but I'm hoping I can get him there.

780
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,680
I would love for him to just be a panelist on one panel.

781
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,120
I think he would be so good.

782
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:20,840
So we'll see. I'm going to try.

783
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:21,840
I'm going to keep trying.

784
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:25,680
But look forward to that in Atlanta over Labor Day weekend.

785
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:26,880
So there's that.

786
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:30,120
So D.J. Rama says, is Alan cosplaying?

787
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:33,480
That's a great question, actually.

788
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,480
Not yet.

789
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:40,240
But I think Alan and I are going to need to invest in some Starfleet uniforms

790
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:44,200
because we already booked for next year's Star Trek Cruise.

791
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:50,560
So so no show February 20 something 2024.

792
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:53,120
Just get that out there now.

793
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:56,200
The same week in February next year, you're you're going to have off again.

794
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:03,120
Still, I think that you should show DS9 some love because it was the best.

795
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:05,880
This whole cruise was DS9 love.

796
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:08,440
I have a photo with the cast of DS9. I'll have to show it to you.

797
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:10,280
It was great.

798
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:13,960
And we got to do we got to do a charity breakfast with Chase Masterson,

799
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:16,600
who played Lita on a lot of episodes.

800
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:20,400
And she she does a great anti-bullying charity called Be Kind.

801
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,680
And she talks a lot about that. Anyway, I'm getting off track.

802
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,880
Join us Thursday. We'll talk more about that.

803
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,640
But yes, Deep Space Nine was well represented

804
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,600
because they were it was the 30th anniversary.

805
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:31,480
So they had a lot of the cast there. It was really cool.

806
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,360
That's absolutely my favorite series.

807
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:37,120
It's it's it's interesting how that series is getting a lot more love now.

808
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:41,520
They're saying that streaming really helped that series out a lot

809
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:44,080
and get the credit that it deserved, that it wasn't getting before.

810
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:45,000
It's very interesting.

811
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:49,520
Let's see. Jaskren says hell yeah to Alan being there.

812
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,040
I know Jaskren goes to Dragon Con.

813
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:53,040
Yeah, I'm really excited about that, too, as well.

814
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:59,120
YYR asking kind of a out of the blue question, but I like this.

815
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:02,000
So let me ask this question before or answer this question

816
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,920
before we get into the stories tonight.

817
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:08,240
YYR says, did anyone else catch the DDR tournament

818
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:10,800
last night on the Ohio DDR Twitch channel?

819
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:12,600
It was mind blowing.

820
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:16,720
The new players coming on up to the pinnacle of human skill are just amazing.

821
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:19,160
And my short answer is no.

822
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:22,400
But my long answer is I wish I'd known about it and I would have.

823
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:24,760
But probably because, again, I'd been out for a week.

824
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:26,800
Of course, I didn't know about it.

825
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:30,680
But I do think it's fascinating that because these things can be streamed,

826
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,000
you know, I think back.

827
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,120
OK, so I was like, they didn't really stream DDR contest back in the day.

828
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:38,400
You had to wait for the videos to be published later.

829
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:42,960
But remember the DDR tournament at Pier 39?

830
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,600
It was called B3.

831
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:47,600
There was a live stream of that tournament. Who did it?

832
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:50,600
Us at Orange Launch Radio.

833
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:53,000
It's our first major on location event.

834
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:57,520
Run off off with with a mutual friend for lunch.

835
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:01,960
And I think that was when we gave the microphone to Jahi, if you remember him.

836
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:04,160
And he just he just ran the show for like two hours.

837
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:06,560
And I'm sure it was amazing.

838
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:09,240
I miss that guy, too. So funny.

839
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:13,640
But anyway, what else is it going to say about that tournament?

840
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:16,160
Oh, there was no video back then because this is ancient times.

841
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:18,160
It was like 2004. We didn't have the Internet for video.

842
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:21,160
So it was like audio only. But it was really, really fun.

843
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:24,520
And YYR says there were 900 people watching live towards the end.

844
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:26,480
So this got noticed. That's awesome.

845
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:29,880
I really want to see some DDR tournaments on Twitch.

846
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:31,000
I think that's a great thing.

847
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:35,040
And we know that DDR and dance games in general have been getting more visibility

848
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:38,800
because of things like Games Done Quick that have done the showcases on Twitch and so forth.

849
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:41,720
And not just that. There's been, you know, tournaments and lots of things.

850
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:46,640
And, you know, even us olds in our 40s can that we're back.

851
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:48,320
We're into DDR back in the day.

852
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:52,160
We all recognize there's some new get there's some up and coming kids now.

853
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:54,640
There's some new kids up and coming.

854
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,000
Do not saying we used to do.

855
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,120
And I think it's great. I'm glad the DDR is thriving.

856
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:04,320
And I realize that, you know, round one's resurgence, getting more arcade machines out there

857
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:08,320
and so forth have really helped give that game a new tailwind.

858
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:10,560
And I think it's great. So, yeah.

859
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:13,320
And Freestyle Takeover always streams that stuff. Yep, yep, yep.

860
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:15,840
So awesome. Awesome.

861
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:19,080
Yes. Please do ping the discord if you catch one of those in progress later on.

862
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:21,240
All right. Let's move on.

863
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:23,360
Let's get into some of the other news we missed this week.

864
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:29,120
And we will go to Loki for tonight's story, which isn't directly about video games,

865
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:32,720
but it kind of is. It's super adjacent.

866
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:37,600
No, I have a follow up story to this from my trip, but I'm going to let you tell this.

867
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:41,240
I mean, when you think about it, though, what what

868
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:46,200
retail store carries the majority of these?

869
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:49,280
It's a game store. It's GameStop.

870
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:53,600
And we're talking about Funko Pops. GameStop's number one export nowadays.

871
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:59,560
And Funko Pops maybe not doing as well as they had hoped.

872
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,600
But apparently there is going to be 30 million

873
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:07,400
dollars worth of Funko Pops heading to a landfill.

874
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:09,320
It's like it's 1983 all over again.

875
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:12,600
And we're burying, you know, E.T. in landfills.

876
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:15,560
But no, they're going to be,

877
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:19,320
I guess, dumping those because they're not able to sell them off.

878
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:24,600
The inventory at the end of year totaled 20 or 246.4 million,

879
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:27,640
an increase of 48 percent compared to a year ago.

880
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:31,760
And says the inventory or this includes inventory that the company intends

881
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:35,720
to eliminate in the first half of 2023 to reduce fulfillment costs

882
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:39,120
by managing inventory levels to align with the operating

883
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:42,040
operating capacity of our distribution center,

884
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:45,680
because it costs money to store things in a warehouse.

885
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:49,880
So therefore, it's best for them to get rid of those things in a warehouse

886
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:52,920
or just, you know, don't manufacture them in the first place.

887
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:57,320
Oh, they actually have canceled a bunch of series like the Dead by Daylight Pops.

888
00:45:57,320 --> 00:45:59,600
They were going to do, which I was super excited about.

889
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:01,440
They canceled them.

890
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,200
Yeah, because they're probably producing a lot of these.

891
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:06,840
I can only imagine it would be very hard to estimate

892
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:09,680
and forecast what they would need for a lot of these.

893
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:16,080
And, you know, who knows when stuff either gets moved around, canceled.

894
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:18,760
I mean, I don't know if they're making funko pops based off like,

895
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:22,080
you know, Batgirl or anything like that, those movies. But like.

896
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:25,800
I can only imagine that,

897
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:29,600
you know, there's a finite amount of funko pops that a person can own

898
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:31,600
or have room for, like. Right.

899
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:34,440
Well, look at look at what happened with their stock prices

900
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:38,160
when they announced their forecast for Q4, everything just flushed.

901
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:42,480
Yeah, yeah, these things have been oversaturated for some time,

902
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:45,160
like and I don't hate funko pops.

903
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:48,320
I just recognize that they're they're too much.

904
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:50,480
And they are this comment in chat.

905
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:54,480
Dijarama says, let's be real funko over licensed properties for pops.

906
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:56,440
That shouldn't be. Absolutely.

907
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:58,640
And it's interesting to me.

908
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:02,840
I made the little joke comparison in the sidebar here live on Twitch.

909
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,160
They're going to join Atari 2600 properties in the garbage heap

910
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:08,440
because the same thing happened to Atari back in the day.

911
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:11,000
And those documentaries about them

912
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,280
digging up copies of ET out of the landfill and stuff are really fascinating.

913
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:17,080
And it's interesting that funko is meeting a similar fate.

914
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:21,560
And it's it's it's the great funko crash is what we're seeing play out now.

915
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:24,880
But how does this affect video games?

916
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:28,000
This is going to be the final nail in the coffin for GameStop.

917
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:32,760
This will absolutely be the final nail in the coffin for GameStop, I think.

918
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:38,440
But it's I mean, it's all they sell nowadays, or at least mostly what they sell.

919
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:43,200
You go in there and there's equal, if not more space per like you look at each.

920
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:47,480
You would think that funko was its own like game console

921
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:50,680
because they have more shelf space than than games.

922
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:54,880
And I mean, it's understandable because they probably make more margin from that.

923
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:58,160
And it comes down to just they're in survival mode over there.

924
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:02,960
And. Yeah, I just I don't see it happening.

925
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:05,480
They couldn't even do it when they're there.

926
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:10,240
Their stock is over evaluated for like how much it's worth.

927
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:14,480
And like. They couldn't even do that with that cast cash influx.

928
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:19,320
It's just they still it's just not a successful business model anymore, I think.

929
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:21,960
Let me tell you an interesting. Oh, go ahead, Jamie.

930
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:25,840
I was just going to say, though, like if they completely crash

931
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:29,560
and go out of business and wait for like another five years

932
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:32,480
and people will be like, oh, fun goes and then you'll find them

933
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:35,040
for like super expensive. Mm hmm.

934
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:37,440
Let me tell an interesting aside story from the cruise.

935
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:40,040
I promise it's relevant. It is absolutely relevant.

936
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:43,640
So as part of the cruise, not only was it a Star Trek cruise,

937
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:45,240
but cruises go to cities, right?

938
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:48,320
So we we docked in three different ports,

939
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:50,920
Cabo San Lucas, Mazatlan and Puerto Vallarta.

940
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:53,600
I've never been to Puerto Vallarta and I was very excited to go.

941
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:54,600
And I had a great time.

942
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:57,040
But one of the things I thought we had more hours in Puerto Vallarta

943
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:58,080
than anywhere else.

944
00:48:58,080 --> 00:49:01,600
And the boat docked across the street from a mall.

945
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,920
And I was just kind of curious, like, oh, I wonder what the malls in Mexico

946
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:07,520
are like, I wonder what kind of stuff I can find there

947
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:09,880
and, you know, things that maybe I can't find back home and so forth.

948
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:13,040
So we went into the mall in Puerto Vallarta

949
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:16,440
and I saw a store called Game Planet.

950
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:19,560
And I my my brain actually kind of thought of this show

951
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:22,360
because we've had a listener from Mexico for a long time.

952
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:25,680
This will see the show, Mike Deft, Holla, I know you're listening out there.

953
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:30,240
And Mike Deft has always really kind of enlightened us a bit to how gaming

954
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:33,000
purchases kind of work in another country,

955
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:37,680
where maybe some game companies have not always had an official presence.

956
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:40,280
And that was always very fascinating to me.

957
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:44,760
Now, keep in mind, Mexico, big country, just like the U.S., right?

958
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:48,120
Mike Deft lives in like Oregon.

959
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:51,120
And the place in Mexico I was at was like Oklahoma.

960
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:52,560
OK, there were very different parts.

961
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:54,360
Puerto Vallarta is a very different part of the country.

962
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:58,680
However, there was a store I went into in the mall called Game Planet.

963
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:01,600
And when I went into the mall or went to the store,

964
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:04,600
my first reaction was this is this is just a GameStop.

965
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:07,800
This is like but it's way more Nintendo stuff.

966
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:10,160
I noticed because I was like, oh, Nintendo probably has a presence.

967
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:13,800
But then the other the back half of the wall and I'm going to show this.

968
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:15,840
I'm sorry to the podcast listeners.

969
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:18,080
Let me actually switch the shot here so you can see this.

970
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:20,880
Notice how the back wall where I'm standing,

971
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:24,560
it's all fun goes just like any GameStop.

972
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:26,960
I think I took that picture and sent it to our Discord.

973
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:30,760
And then, of course, like game cards for like PlayStation Network

974
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:31,680
and some other things.

975
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:34,360
Otherwise, the signage was all in Spanish and all that.

976
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:37,720
But it was pretty much like any GameStop I've ever been into otherwise.

977
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,880
But it was interesting because I kind of thought about Mike Deft

978
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:42,560
when I when I went in there.

979
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:46,000
So as to how Matt says, I was blown away

980
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:48,440
that Sears is alive and thriving while in Mexico.

981
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:51,240
I didn't go to a Sears, but I did go to a different store.

982
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:52,720
And I already forget the name of it.

983
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:56,440
But it was it was neat because it was like it was like a Sears,

984
00:50:56,840 --> 00:51:00,240
but had like a travel department in it and a flower store

985
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:04,280
because flowers are huge in the culture in Mexico.

986
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:07,920
The we actually went on a tour in Mazatlan and they were saying that the flower

987
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:11,320
shop was open 24 hours because for every occasion there's

988
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:12,840
and the flowers are beautiful, too.

989
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:15,640
Like it's not just, you know, any old flowers.

990
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:18,120
They were really very beautiful arrangements.

991
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:19,400
Liverpool says Mike Deft.

992
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:20,960
Thank you. That's it. That's it.

993
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:23,120
So anyway, quick aside from the cruise.

994
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:27,960
But my point being funko pops taking over the store.

995
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:30,680
Not a unique problem to the US.

996
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:37,560
Very much the case in Mexico as well, from what I observed,

997
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:40,800
and I'm sure Canada probably over overseas as well.

998
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:43,600
I don't know if there's like, you know, big import fees overseas and stuff,

999
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:46,960
but probably a very similar story as well. So.

1000
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:50,800
But I think the bubble is finally burst on these funko pops.

1001
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:54,040
And honestly, I hate to say it, maybe it's for the best.

1002
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:56,920
Maybe it does cause funko to scale back a bit.

1003
00:51:56,920 --> 00:52:00,040
And now we it's not like I don't own any funko pop dolls. I do.

1004
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:02,640
I'm looking right at some Mass Effect Andromeda dolls that I have.

1005
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:06,680
And I have some for Drag Race, you know, some other things as well that we enjoy.

1006
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:11,800
I think maybe they'll have to scale back a little bit and maybe more intentionally

1007
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:14,320
pick some of the partnerships and some of the like, you know,

1008
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:18,240
I didn't like how it's all exclusive at this store and that store

1009
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:20,360
and like all of this stuff. So.

1010
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:25,080
Anyway, that's that's the only way we can get them to carry those things.

1011
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:30,040
And also, I mean, I think a lot of it is people, some some people buy these

1012
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:33,200
because we're just the world we live in nowadays thinking that there's

1013
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:36,720
a speculative market for it as well and that they're going to be worth something.

1014
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:39,120
And I don't know that they are.

1015
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:41,640
I don't think most of them are worth anything.

1016
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:46,560
It's just do you want to keep it or do you want to like not keep?

1017
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:48,840
I don't know. They don't do anything either.

1018
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:50,840
So it's like, I don't know.

1019
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:54,040
The same thing could be said about collecting action figures

1020
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:58,280
or collecting, you know, statues, anime statues.

1021
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:03,280
It's all, you know, I I get sick of people who are like,

1022
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:05,360
oh, you do funko's meh.

1023
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:07,360
I'm like, I don't care. You don't live my life.

1024
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:09,440
Yeah. People can like what they like.

1025
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:13,840
Yeah. But, you know, it's like for all the people who are like going,

1026
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:15,520
hey, look at that, look at that.

1027
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:17,520
I mean, there's people who are going to be really disappointed.

1028
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:19,760
I wanted those those. Yeah.

1029
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:23,040
Dead by daylight ones.

1030
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:24,800
And now I don't get them.

1031
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:26,800
You know, I'm really disappointed over it.

1032
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:30,200
I just I'm just like.

1033
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:34,120
People need to let people like their stuff, but we also need to make sure

1034
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:38,120
that we're holding, you know, companies accountable for their poor

1035
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:39,840
financial decisions. Right.

1036
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:41,680
You know, they tried to do everything.

1037
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:45,320
They tried to put out something for every fandom. Yeah.

1038
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:50,520
And do you know how many fandoms and just different shit people are into?

1039
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:54,240
It's a lot. You cannot. You cannot. Absolutely.

1040
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:56,880
They way overstepped.

1041
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:58,200
Let's see. Yeah. Tiger College

1042
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:00,720
has a couple of years from now, someone will do a documentary

1043
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:03,880
on digging those funko pops at the landfill and then somebody else

1044
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:05,440
just like the cartridges.

1045
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:07,520
They will sell them and you can buy them this.

1046
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:09,040
I was once in a landfill.

1047
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:12,040
You're literally going to be able to put trash on your wall

1048
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:13,000
and people will do it.

1049
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:16,160
And it's just the interesting way our society works.

1050
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:20,440
S2100 Matt asking another question about my trip to Mexico, saying,

1051
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:25,200
did you see the roaming random cars driving around like in Forza Horizon five?

1052
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:31,480
No, but I did notice the absolute lack of traffic laws period.

1053
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:35,600
Or like very, very few traffic lights.

1054
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:39,400
I will say when we were in Mazatlán, our tour guide, she knew

1055
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:43,760
she would jump out into the street and hold her arms up to stop the traffic.

1056
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,400
So all of us, you know,

1057
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:48,480
stupid Americans and Canadians could walk by and cross the street

1058
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:51,480
because, you know, people don't stop unless you,

1059
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:54,280
you know, make it very clear to do those sorts of things.

1060
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:56,880
This is this wasn't like some obscure part of town.

1061
00:54:56,920 --> 00:54:59,720
This is like downtown Mazatlán, the old town district.

1062
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:03,000
So I was that I definitely noticed that

1063
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:06,320
the absolute lack of any traffic laws whatsoever.

1064
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:08,440
But you know what?

1065
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:11,040
I got from point A to point B.

1066
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:14,760
We got from our boat down to Zona Romantica, which was like a three

1067
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:17,240
three mile journey.

1068
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:20,280
It was too long to walk, but not a very long bus.

1069
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:25,440
I actually took thanks to JD, who is huge on public transit, our buddy JD.

1070
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:29,640
I I rode a Mexican bus.

1071
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:32,880
I paid 10 pesos to ride the Mexican, but actually JD paid for me

1072
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:38,080
10 pesos to ride the Mexican bus from the port down to Zona Romantica.

1073
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:39,800
And it was great.

1074
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:42,480
But anyway, I'll talk more about that on Thursday.

1075
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:46,680
All right. Let's get into this next story.

1076
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:50,840
Oh, you know, when you saw this in the news, you knew I was going to bring this up.

1077
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:53,880
You knew I was going to bring up this story.

1078
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:57,280
Am I here to gloat tonight?

1079
00:55:57,280 --> 00:55:59,200
A little. Maybe. OK.

1080
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:01,080
Yes, but yes, but

1081
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:05,240
I actually don't think there's a lot here to gloat about.

1082
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:07,480
So what am I talking about?

1083
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:12,520
Anybody that listened to our predictions episode in early January probably heard.

1084
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:15,040
And I wish I had time to go find the clip and dig it up.

1085
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:15,960
But you know what?

1086
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:18,440
The podcast is out there. You can go listen to it for yourself.

1087
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:19,480
It's on the record.

1088
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:22,200
One of the predictions I made, I think it was my number three prediction.

1089
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:26,120
I said the current CEO of Square Enix,

1090
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:30,200
Yosuke Matsuda was Square Enix was going to get sacked.

1091
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:35,000
And I said he was going to do it because the fact that he tied himself to NFTs,

1092
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:40,200
the fact that he failed to redirect the PR conversation

1093
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:44,160
around the Final Fantasy 16 diversity issue and people raise it,

1094
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:47,120
you know, they're very, you know, what was a poor response to all of that

1095
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:50,520
and not, you know, doing better on clarifying

1096
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:52,880
and showing how they're going to do better in that whole situation.

1097
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:58,040
And then, of course, you know, add into that things like the fact that Babylon's fall

1098
00:56:58,080 --> 00:56:59,720
absolutely flopped.

1099
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:02,320
There is no nice way to put it.

1100
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:06,240
I don't think four spoken is unfortunately selling to expectations,

1101
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:09,200
especially when this same guy has gone on the record

1102
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:12,720
saying things like Tomb Raider did not sell the expectations.

1103
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:14,840
Well, if Tomb Raider didn't sell the expectations,

1104
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:17,760
I'm positive for spoken and sell the expectations either.

1105
00:57:18,080 --> 00:57:21,200
So what happened? Where does this all end up? Yep.

1106
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:26,920
You know, Suki Matsuda was officially sacked by Square Enix this week.

1107
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:29,720
The company has announced this shake up on Friday,

1108
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:33,560
saying it is needed to chase more technological innovation.

1109
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:37,800
Now, here's where I'm willing to admit this is not the part of the news

1110
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:42,080
I saw coming, because unfortunately, although, yes, I thank you,

1111
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:46,280
Jaskren, who says I saw the news and I thought that Rob might be a prophet.

1112
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:50,480
OK, so maybe I did call this, but the reasoning here,

1113
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:54,280
not what I thought I would see, and that's not a good thing.

1114
00:57:54,680 --> 00:58:01,360
So the replacement for Matsuda is a gentleman named Takashi Kiryu,

1115
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:04,360
who is a new CEO. He's only been at Square for a few years.

1116
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:09,080
But prior to that, he worked for the Dentsu Innovation Initiative.

1117
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:13,880
This is a business group that explores opportunities in things like the metaverse.

1118
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:19,080
Here's the official on the record reason that Square Enix gave

1119
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:21,200
for why this transition is happening.

1120
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:24,960
Keep in mind, Matsuda was there for 10 years.

1121
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:28,560
That is that is a long tenureship.

1122
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:32,720
Under the rapid change of business environments surrounding

1123
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:34,160
the entertainment industry,

1124
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:37,560
the proposed change is intended to reshape the management team

1125
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:41,920
with the goal of adopting ever evolving technological innovations

1126
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:45,320
and maximizing on the creativity of the company's group

1127
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:49,640
in order to deliver even greater entertainment to customers around the world.

1128
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:53,160
Ever evolving technological innovations.

1129
00:58:54,120 --> 00:58:56,720
That worries me because they're not talking about PS6.

1130
00:58:57,320 --> 00:58:58,760
They're not talking about VR.

1131
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:06,120
They're talking about NFTs and what I think the new buzzword in everybody's ear.

1132
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:09,000
This is where I really think it's going, AI.

1133
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:13,120
How that gets worked into video games,

1134
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:14,920
I'm not sure what that looks like yet.

1135
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:16,440
AI is already in video games, though.

1136
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:19,640
Oh, very good point.

1137
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:20,720
Yes, AI. You're right.

1138
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:24,840
AI, the concept of AI has been in video games since video games existed, really.

1139
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:29,360
Machine learning in and of itself is common now.

1140
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:29,640
Yeah.

1141
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:31,400
Especially in a lot of technology.

1142
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:33,760
So I...

1143
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:35,080
Totally fair.

1144
00:59:35,080 --> 00:59:39,360
I chose my words poorly because what I mean to say is AI in regards

1145
00:59:39,360 --> 00:59:44,840
to some of this newer trend about automated art, automated writing,

1146
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:50,000
and could there be a game that ends up being a forever game

1147
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:54,480
that is able to be forever because AI generates a chunk of it?

1148
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:57,240
I have a feeling this is what Square Enix wants to get on.

1149
00:59:57,520 --> 00:59:58,880
They want to make an open world game

1150
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:02,240
that is in part generated by AI, for better or for worse.

1151
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:04,440
Sounds interesting.

1152
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:05,440
It could be interesting.

1153
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:08,080
I don't know. I have to see it.

1154
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:10,960
I can see potential in that kind of idea.

1155
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:13,640
Like, imagine that you start off with like a base world

1156
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:19,480
and as the people, quote, exist in it and play through it like like an MMO,

1157
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:23,160
the landscape changes, like say that you buy

1158
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:26,320
a plot of land and you do construction on it.

1159
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:32,000
That plot of lands, you know, the the ground moves to other places.

1160
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:33,880
You know, it damages a river.

1161
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:38,080
So, you know, that having something like that would actually be really awesome.

1162
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:41,440
I worry that's not where Square is going with it.

1163
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:42,960
We'll see. Time will tell.

1164
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:45,200
And I'm willing to give this guy a chance.

1165
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:49,080
And I'm not going to judge this guy completely on his background,

1166
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:51,800
because what he did in the past is not what he's going to do now.

1167
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:56,520
So I'm willing to give this guy a fresh slate and see where does he take this now?

1168
01:00:56,800 --> 01:00:59,280
I'm not encouraged by what I'm hearing, but let's see.

1169
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:00,960
Because you're right, DarkSocker.

1170
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:02,760
You don't run Square Enix. Neither do I.

1171
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:04,560
Here's where I see the problem.

1172
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:09,800
OK, the problem, and I think this is why Matsuda ultimately paid the price.

1173
01:01:10,120 --> 01:01:12,800
The problem was these very high profile,

1174
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:16,760
big bunch budget launches that are flopping.

1175
01:01:17,360 --> 01:01:19,000
And there's no nice way to say it.

1176
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,960
That's that's not a testament to the quality of the game.

1177
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:25,680
Well, I think it is in Babylon's fall case, but I haven't played Forspoken.

1178
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:30,600
I'm not I'm not able to speak to why that game flopped, but I have a hunch

1179
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:32,720
it's because the demo they put out wasn't great.

1180
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:36,080
And when you're asking people to invest 70 dollars in a game,

1181
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:39,720
you need to have a rock solid demo or no demo at all, quite frankly.

1182
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:44,080
I thought that game looked awesome and everything that I had seen,

1183
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:47,160
I just didn't buy it because I have no way to play it right now. Right.

1184
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:50,800
And I want to I want to also show something else, because I believe

1185
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:55,560
where Square Enix needs to be going is some of these more middle of the road.

1186
01:01:55,560 --> 01:01:59,280
I do think Square Enix needs to do some investment in the middle of the road

1187
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:04,080
and some lower budget titles that can actually bring forth

1188
01:02:04,080 --> 01:02:07,400
a little more than maybe a big budget AI or NFT project.

1189
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:11,280
Here's some of the proof I want to kind of to make my case, you know,

1190
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:13,720
and maybe you're going to read into this differently than I do.

1191
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:16,360
But here's me attempting to show some receipts. OK.

1192
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:18,320
Now, I'm not able to find the U.S.

1193
01:02:18,320 --> 01:02:21,000
sales numbers yet for how some games are performing.

1194
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:26,280
However, Forspoken in Japan was last in the top 30

1195
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:30,480
the week of I believe this was February 6th through February 12th.

1196
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:33,480
And you can see when it was last in the top 30,

1197
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:39,880
it moved 1932 units for a total of 35,000 units.

1198
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:42,320
Now, granted, this is retail units.

1199
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:44,120
This doesn't count what's digital.

1200
01:02:44,120 --> 01:02:47,080
So I'm not saying this game only moved 35,000 copies.

1201
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:51,280
But, you know, just to kind of set the benchmark there, this high dollar

1202
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:57,200
big budget game looks like it's going to cap out maybe at 40,000 copies in Japan,

1203
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:02,200
unless maybe there's some bang up DLC that happens later or something like that

1204
01:03:02,440 --> 01:03:06,240
that, you know, causes this game to sell more. In contrast,

1205
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:13,200
the Square Enix game that I am unable to shut up about, Theatrhythm, shows up.

1206
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:15,280
Now, we don't have complete sales data for Theatrhythm,

1207
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:18,040
but it shows up on the next week's sales list. Right.

1208
01:03:18,320 --> 01:03:21,920
And so we have two entries for Theatrhythm because it's on two platforms.

1209
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:26,160
The Switch copy has moved 11,000 units in, excuse me,

1210
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:28,560
11.5 thousand units in its first week.

1211
01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:32,400
And the PlayStation 4 versions down here at number 16,

1212
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:36,760
which moved 3.6 thousand units in its first week.

1213
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:40,520
You add that together, that's about 15,000

1214
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:43,920
in the first week that this game has moved.

1215
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:47,760
Now, granted, that's not that's not even half of 40,000,

1216
01:03:48,040 --> 01:03:51,240
but we're not quite sure yet what the subsequent weeks are going to look like.

1217
01:03:51,240 --> 01:03:55,200
And even if this game only capped out at maybe 30,000 units,

1218
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:59,720
and I would also argue Theatrhythm is certainly going to sell even more

1219
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:02,760
digitally because of things like the Digital Deluxe Edition

1220
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:04,760
and some of those things that they've been offering digitally.

1221
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:08,640
I would bet dimes to dollars, even if I don't have the receipts to prove it.

1222
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:11,520
Theatrhythm is going to sell more digitally

1223
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:15,840
than it's going to in a physical copy than a game like Forespoken.

1224
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:22,000
My point being, even if Theatrhythm and Forespoken sell the same amount,

1225
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:26,880
which my receipts only maybe show that that's the way things are going to go right now.

1226
01:04:27,320 --> 01:04:31,640
One of those games took a hell of a lot more money to make than the other.

1227
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:36,280
Now, I know some of you are going to poke holes in my theory left and right.

1228
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:38,200
Rob, you're only considering Japan.

1229
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:39,760
Rob, it's only physical.

1230
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:42,480
And, you know, there's these I understand I'm willing to accept

1231
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:44,720
that this is not a perfect science what I'm showing you.

1232
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:49,560
What I'm trying to point out is that a game like Theatrhythm

1233
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:54,000
that cost a fraction to make of something like Forespoken,

1234
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:57,440
this is where Square Enix needs to head a lot more of.

1235
01:04:57,720 --> 01:05:01,080
They need to maybe play it safe for a little bit

1236
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:04,600
and maybe give us that Chrono Trigger remaster

1237
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:06,680
that Jason was referencing in the intro tonight

1238
01:05:06,920 --> 01:05:10,520
and some of these other things that can move a fair amount of units

1239
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:14,920
to then build up the coffers to try again on one of these AAA titles

1240
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:18,560
that maybe, you know, a big name can get behind or something like that.

1241
01:05:18,560 --> 01:05:23,600
You know, if Final Fantasy 16 does very well, it's too early to say.

1242
01:05:23,600 --> 01:05:27,000
And I'm not going to venture a guess on how well Final Fantasy 16 is going to sell.

1243
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:33,240
But if Final Fantasy 16 does well, let's say it does better than 15 or 13,

1244
01:05:33,640 --> 01:05:35,640
which it might, it might.

1245
01:05:37,120 --> 01:05:40,000
Despite however you feel about the controversies on this whole thing,

1246
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:42,280
I think you could recognize there's a real possibility

1247
01:05:42,280 --> 01:05:47,160
16 could sell better than 15 or 13 did, or 12, quite honestly.

1248
01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:49,320
Hell, we'd have to go all the way back to 10.

1249
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:52,720
I think 16 is going to sell better than any game since 10. I do.

1250
01:05:53,600 --> 01:05:58,480
If that, well, minus the MMOs, don't include 14, because that's not fair.

1251
01:05:58,680 --> 01:06:03,240
Because the monthly fee, that's filling Square's bank account right now

1252
01:06:03,240 --> 01:06:05,120
is 14, to some extent 11.

1253
01:06:05,120 --> 01:06:06,480
So we're not going to count those.

1254
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:11,520
But as far as 16 goes, if 16 does well,

1255
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:19,920
I would bet Naoki Yoshida, Yoshi-P, gets licensed to make whatever game he wants.

1256
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:23,480
And honestly, he should.

1257
01:06:24,840 --> 01:06:29,680
Hopefully he will listen to some of the feedback on the types of characters he should be putting in those games.

1258
01:06:30,040 --> 01:06:32,160
But I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna go too far down.

1259
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:35,240
I mean, 14 has done a pretty good job.

1260
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:40,960
So there's, you know, and I got into this when we talked about the controversy to begin with

1261
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:44,160
is that I think there's a lot more play than just Yoshida.

1262
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:49,320
I think it's the voices that have educated Yoshida in the past need to be corrected.

1263
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:50,960
But I'm gonna, I'm gonna digress.

1264
01:06:51,080 --> 01:06:55,080
I think Yoshida is going to get creative license to do whatever he wants next.

1265
01:06:55,080 --> 01:06:58,960
And that will be the new AAA offering that comes out of Square Enix.

1266
01:06:59,240 --> 01:07:00,480
So we'll, we'll see.

1267
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:06,360
Jaskren in chat says, this is a really good analysis.

1268
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:10,200
There is more money to be made with smaller budget games if those games are hits.

1269
01:07:10,520 --> 01:07:14,040
It is very similar to the movie industry.

1270
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:19,280
The movie industry wants movies like The Blair Witch Project.

1271
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:21,320
There's something about Mary.

1272
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:25,320
Hell, everything everywhere all at once would fall into this category.

1273
01:07:25,480 --> 01:07:27,400
What do all of these movies have in common?

1274
01:07:28,360 --> 01:07:30,760
Small or paranormal activity.

1275
01:07:30,760 --> 01:07:31,520
Another great example.

1276
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:36,240
Small, very small, in some case, budget movies that make a lot of money.

1277
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:38,520
They want those type of movies.

1278
01:07:38,520 --> 01:07:39,080
Snakes on the plane.

1279
01:07:39,240 --> 01:07:41,000
Yep, snakes on the plane, great example.

1280
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:46,120
Honestly, Megan and Cocaine Bear, you want to go, at least I'm assuming Cocaine Bear made money.

1281
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:48,280
Sure sounded like it was going to.

1282
01:07:49,160 --> 01:07:58,080
The studios want those movies, as opposed to Oh, God, what was that absolute Disney flop that came out, like, last year?

1283
01:07:58,320 --> 01:08:00,840
It was a couple of years ago, maybe it was before the pandemic even.

1284
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:06,520
And it just flopped so hard in theaters that like, yeah, it was it was, it was really ugly.

1285
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:08,480
The movie industry wants those things.

1286
01:08:08,520 --> 01:08:10,280
John Carter was that maybe?

1287
01:08:10,560 --> 01:08:13,240
No, I feel like it was a superhero movie of some sort.

1288
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:15,200
Maybe based on mythology.

1289
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:16,000
I don't remember.

1290
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:16,760
I'm sorry, y'all.

1291
01:08:16,840 --> 01:08:20,200
Oh, you're thinking of Percy Jackson?

1292
01:08:21,560 --> 01:08:23,360
No, but that is a good example.

1293
01:08:24,520 --> 01:08:25,800
No, no, I know what you're thinking of.

1294
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:30,360
You're thinking of Oh, God, it costs him a lot of money.

1295
01:08:31,360 --> 01:08:32,240
My kids have the books.

1296
01:08:32,280 --> 01:08:33,640
Yes, it was books.

1297
01:08:33,640 --> 01:08:39,400
Oh, no, it's not John Carter.

1298
01:08:39,400 --> 01:08:40,360
It's not John Carter.

1299
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:42,400
It's more recent that John Carter's like years ago.

1300
01:08:42,720 --> 01:08:46,520
I was like, I was back when I was in the No, not Buzz Lightyear.

1301
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:47,120
I'll look it up.

1302
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:47,560
Hold on.

1303
01:08:47,560 --> 01:08:48,360
I don't remember.

1304
01:08:48,360 --> 01:08:49,120
It's called now.

1305
01:08:49,160 --> 01:08:51,560
It's John Carter.

1306
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:53,480
They're they're all saying it was John Carter of Mars.

1307
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:54,720
So maybe maybe it wasn't.

1308
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:56,160
That was a flop, too.

1309
01:08:56,160 --> 01:08:59,760
But there was another word because I don't even know what it is.

1310
01:09:00,120 --> 01:09:03,120
But I thought I thought it was like a mythological story or something.

1311
01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:05,280
No, it's it's not John Carter.

1312
01:09:05,280 --> 01:09:08,760
I know for a fact it's not it's my kids have the books.

1313
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:09,560
It's not.

1314
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:12,320
It came out like during the pandemic.

1315
01:09:13,400 --> 01:09:16,880
I just don't remember it was called it was Artemis Fowl.

1316
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:17,720
That's what it was.

1317
01:09:17,760 --> 01:09:20,640
Oh, that Artemis Fowl was awful.

1318
01:09:20,680 --> 01:09:21,920
It was foul.

1319
01:09:22,240 --> 01:09:22,720
Yeah.

1320
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:26,360
Anyway, I all these.

1321
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:29,680
OK, I mean, yes, we're all guessing get in Rob's brain.

1322
01:09:29,680 --> 01:09:31,080
What's the movie he's thinking of?

1323
01:09:31,160 --> 01:09:34,640
Everything you guys are shouting in chat is actually making my point.

1324
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:36,680
So thank you for the new mutants.

1325
01:09:36,680 --> 01:09:38,080
I don't think that was that good either.

1326
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:40,640
And that was like the X-Men.

1327
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:43,160
And I don't know how well Mulan did the live action one,

1328
01:09:43,160 --> 01:09:45,160
but I don't think as good as Lion King.

1329
01:09:45,160 --> 01:09:50,000
But I think Square Enix would be very smart to stick to the Octopath Travelers,

1330
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:53,880
the Bravely defaults, the hell, the Dungeon Explorer.

1331
01:09:53,880 --> 01:09:57,920
Even if I think that game has some big flaws with it, that game doesn't

1332
01:09:58,160 --> 01:10:03,960
doesn't get a CEO fired when it doesn't do well, as opposed to a Babylon's fall.

1333
01:10:04,160 --> 01:10:08,640
I think Square Enix needs to take some safer risks so they can find out what

1334
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:11,680
their audience really wants so they can make the big one.

1335
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:16,800
I worry when they talk like this, tomorrow's technologies, whether it's NFT,

1336
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:21,200
whether it's AI or whatever, they're going to try to tell us the next big thing

1337
01:10:21,200 --> 01:10:25,840
and not listen to what the audience is telling you with their wallets.

1338
01:10:26,280 --> 01:10:26,880
And guess what?

1339
01:10:26,920 --> 01:10:29,480
I would bet, I would bet money.

1340
01:10:30,120 --> 01:10:33,400
They did not expect Theatrhythm to even move

1341
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:35,840
what the number of units that I just talked about.

1342
01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:39,880
Nostalgia is a wild thing.

1343
01:10:40,200 --> 01:10:43,560
And I get I'm not saying I want Square Enix to only

1344
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:47,960
do the nostalgia jerk for years and years.

1345
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:52,480
I do want Square Enix to be able to create things like Fourspoken

1346
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:55,120
and create new types of things.

1347
01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:57,160
They just need to be able to do it

1348
01:10:58,520 --> 01:10:59,520
on a smaller budget

1349
01:11:00,760 --> 01:11:01,600
for a little while.

1350
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:06,120
And honestly, offloading some of the companies

1351
01:11:06,120 --> 01:11:09,120
that they did may actually help them to that.

1352
01:11:09,320 --> 01:11:13,560
Prince Caspian, that was no that because that was a Narnia movie.

1353
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:15,800
No, no, no. Anyway, forget it.

1354
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:17,960
That was like super old too.

1355
01:11:17,960 --> 01:11:19,840
I'm I'm done trying to figure it out.

1356
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:21,880
Maybe I'll Google it while Loki does the next story.

1357
01:11:21,880 --> 01:11:22,920
It was Artemis Fowl.

1358
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:24,880
I can tell you right now because it was awful.

1359
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:27,920
And I don't even remember if that came out in theaters.

1360
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:31,760
But like, yeah, they've had a lot of flops with as far as big budget.

1361
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:33,480
Yeah. John Carpenter and Mars.

1362
01:11:33,480 --> 01:11:36,960
They were expecting it to be like a big new trilogy like Star Wars size.

1363
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:38,480
And it probably was. I don't know.

1364
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:40,560
Anyway, that was like years ago.

1365
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:42,560
I'm officially done thinking about it. All right.

1366
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:45,240
What was it going to say?

1367
01:11:45,240 --> 01:11:47,200
Oh, Fifth Dream has a great comment here.

1368
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:51,360
And those games have engines to build, so they'll be cheaper to produce.

1369
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:54,440
Also, that one card game where they put out like for a year,

1370
01:11:54,440 --> 01:11:57,840
just insert a new story and swap assets, new 40 dollar game.

1371
01:11:58,760 --> 01:12:00,920
Are you talking about like Kingdom Hearts, Chains of Memories

1372
01:12:00,920 --> 01:12:01,920
and those types of car games?

1373
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:04,480
But when you talk about the engine, you're absolutely right.

1374
01:12:04,680 --> 01:12:10,920
Look at Octopath, Octopath 2, Live Alive, you know, and where

1375
01:12:10,920 --> 01:12:15,120
I honestly think the Chrono Trigger remake ought to go is in that engine.

1376
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:16,800
And if you want to talk about remakes,

1377
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:19,400
you know, Secret of Mana was in a similar engine,

1378
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:20,920
although that wouldn't do us well.

1379
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:24,000
But, you know, we have Final Fantasy six remake in that engine.

1380
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:26,920
Well, now we have the pixel remasters and so forth.

1381
01:12:26,920 --> 01:12:29,120
So I want it this way.

1382
01:12:30,160 --> 01:12:35,280
Yeah. So anyway, my my point is Square Enix should really listen

1383
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:39,440
to what the fans want and need a CEO that comes in there to really listen to this

1384
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:43,320
and maybe lay off some of the experimentation for a little bit

1385
01:12:43,640 --> 01:12:46,840
while they find their footing again to help them find their next game.

1386
01:12:46,840 --> 01:12:48,600
That's what I would do if I was CEO.

1387
01:12:49,640 --> 01:12:52,880
But I'm not. But also I call this.

1388
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,320
All right. All right.

1389
01:12:55,640 --> 01:12:58,000
My ego is swelling. All right.

1390
01:12:58,000 --> 01:12:59,360
Anyway, let's move on.

1391
01:12:59,360 --> 01:13:00,920
On that note, Dark Soccer.

1392
01:13:00,920 --> 01:13:04,760
Well, if you ruled the world, we'd be getting this a lot sooner.

1393
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:08,040
Right? Mm hmm.

1394
01:13:08,040 --> 01:13:10,480
We would have already been done had it.

1395
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:16,920
So there is a Dead by Daylight movie coming out.

1396
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:21,080
I'm I'm both afraid and excited.

1397
01:13:22,040 --> 01:13:26,440
So it's coming out from Blumhouse and Atomic Monster

1398
01:13:26,440 --> 01:13:29,200
and of course, Behavior, because Behavior owns Dead by Daylight.

1399
01:13:30,320 --> 01:13:35,840
But they are doing a feature film adaptation of Dead by Daylight.

1400
01:13:38,200 --> 01:13:42,200
And they're they sound pretty excited about it.

1401
01:13:43,200 --> 01:13:49,640
There is the for the Atomic Monster founder and CEO, James Wan said,

1402
01:13:50,080 --> 01:13:51,320
I'm going to read the quote.

1403
01:13:51,320 --> 01:13:54,080
In Dead by Daylight, the Behavior team has created a love letter

1404
01:13:54,080 --> 01:13:57,200
to the world of horror, building an incredible environment,

1405
01:13:57,200 --> 01:13:59,640
teeming with atmosphere and terrifying villains,

1406
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:02,000
perfect for a scary cinematic adaptation.

1407
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:04,360
We're big fans of the game at Atomic Monster,

1408
01:14:04,360 --> 01:14:06,160
and we're thrilled to be teaming up with Blumhouse

1409
01:14:06,160 --> 01:14:09,320
to bring this frightening, visceral world to the big screen.

1410
01:14:09,720 --> 01:14:12,720
So they're looking for a director and screenwriter.

1411
01:14:14,160 --> 01:14:18,080
They want to bring on somebody that appreciates

1412
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:20,240
and loves the game like the fans do.

1413
01:14:21,480 --> 01:14:24,920
You know, lots of, I guess, watching of the lore.

1414
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:32,120
And also just FYI, one directed The Conjuring and Insidious

1415
01:14:32,120 --> 01:14:35,440
and Blum produced Get Out and The Purge.

1416
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:40,240
So, I mean, there's some really good like credentials behind it.

1417
01:14:40,240 --> 01:14:41,280
They did Megan too.

1418
01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:44,520
So Blumhouse is a huge name in the horror world right now.

1419
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:47,680
So this is this is a good place for this to be at the end of the day.

1420
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:53,280
I mean, and I have a feeling that they may not be able to get

1421
01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:57,280
like the licensed killers, you know, not without lots of money.

1422
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:02,960
But I have seen see it like with some of like.

1423
01:15:02,960 --> 01:15:06,080
The original four survivors have to be there.

1424
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:06,560
Yeah.

1425
01:15:07,200 --> 01:15:12,480
And I'm thinking that maybe like, you know, the original three

1426
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:19,440
and Nurse and you know, like Hag, you know, like the the in game ones.

1427
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:20,760
I mean, those would be a definite.

1428
01:15:20,760 --> 01:15:22,880
I mean, I would love.

1429
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:25,320
The Hag would be scary because she's a cannibal.

1430
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:29,360
But you know, they're going to set up sequels in their minds,

1431
01:15:29,360 --> 01:15:31,280
so they're they're going to they're going to with everything

1432
01:15:31,280 --> 01:15:32,320
I think you're right on that.

1433
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:36,240
It'll be the originals, maybe Phong Minh and the Doctor,

1434
01:15:36,240 --> 01:15:38,880
just because of her popularity in particular.

1435
01:15:39,440 --> 01:15:41,040
And I think you're right that maybe the nurse.

1436
01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:44,240
But it would be those early DLC characters only.

1437
01:15:44,240 --> 01:15:48,560
And like they're going to save later releases for sequels.

1438
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:49,200
Absolutely.

1439
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:52,800
Like you're not going to see more popular later killers like bleep

1440
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:53,680
or anything like that.

1441
01:15:53,680 --> 01:15:55,360
They won't be in the movie.

1442
01:15:55,360 --> 01:15:59,040
Well, and by then, though, I mean, it could very well be possible

1443
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:02,240
it could very well be possible that they'd have, you know,

1444
01:16:02,240 --> 01:16:06,640
enough interest and revenue from it to invest in the licensed characters.

1445
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:09,440
There's a possibility.

1446
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:12,240
I'm just throwing it out there, although honestly,

1447
01:16:12,240 --> 01:16:15,360
I would love to see the Dredge.

1448
01:16:17,360 --> 01:16:20,000
I think I also don't know if we should write off

1449
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:21,520
the licensed killers completely.

1450
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:23,920
I think, you know, if they could get the rights,

1451
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:26,400
I think especially a cameo at the end.

1452
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:28,800
Imagine right before the credits or at the end of the movie

1453
01:16:29,360 --> 01:16:32,160
I don't know why, but I feel like the most likely one to show up,

1454
01:16:32,160 --> 01:16:36,400
because what else is he doing these days besides getting his own video game, Bubba?

1455
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:38,560
I think if Leatherface showed up at the end of the movie,

1456
01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:43,600
I only say this because I feel like he's got the best chance

1457
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:46,560
versus like a Freddy or, you know, some of the other license.

1458
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:48,240
Freddy would have a better chance.

1459
01:16:48,240 --> 01:16:49,280
You really do.

1460
01:16:49,280 --> 01:16:52,000
Nothing is happening with the Nightmare on Elm Street license.

1461
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:54,240
You know, the other reason?

1462
01:16:54,240 --> 01:16:56,400
Well, here's the other reason why I say Bubba,

1463
01:16:56,400 --> 01:16:59,600
because they could put, and it's to be fair, Michael Myers,

1464
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:00,720
they could do this, too.

1465
01:17:00,720 --> 01:17:02,320
They could put anybody under the mask.

1466
01:17:03,200 --> 01:17:05,840
With Freddy, all everybody's going to say is,

1467
01:17:05,840 --> 01:17:06,960
why isn't it Robert Englund?

1468
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:09,040
That's going to be the problem.

1469
01:17:09,680 --> 01:17:11,280
A mask killer, they could put anyone under the mask.

1470
01:17:11,280 --> 01:17:12,640
I just don't see them going that way at all.

1471
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:15,760
I see them keeping Hillbilly and not putting in Bubba.

1472
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:19,120
You know, I see, I mean, and who knows,

1473
01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:22,160
there might even just be an original killer

1474
01:17:22,160 --> 01:17:24,560
that like you do something with your ticket

1475
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:25,840
and you get them in the game.

1476
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:26,880
I bet they're going to do DLC.

1477
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:30,160
Oh, it debuts in the movie and then is dealing.

1478
01:17:30,160 --> 01:17:31,120
Oh, yeah.

1479
01:17:31,120 --> 01:17:31,680
Oh, yeah.

1480
01:17:32,240 --> 01:17:33,680
Anyway, yeah.

1481
01:17:33,680 --> 01:17:35,600
Tigerfly says, doesn't Dead by Daylight

1482
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:36,880
mostly have original characters?

1483
01:17:36,880 --> 01:17:38,640
The license stuff can't be a part of the movie.

1484
01:17:38,640 --> 01:17:42,240
Yes, but that's not, I mean, it's money in her grievance.

1485
01:17:42,240 --> 01:17:42,880
That's a pretty good split still.

1486
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:44,000
Never say never.

1487
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:44,800
Yeah, it's a good split.

1488
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:50,640
But at any rate, you know, I mean, we're talking about,

1489
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:52,640
you know, not just like you said, Megan,

1490
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:55,360
they did, you know, Malignant, Paranormal Activity,

1491
01:17:55,440 --> 01:17:56,480
Blackphone, you know.

1492
01:17:57,760 --> 01:17:58,400
There's a lot.

1493
01:17:58,400 --> 01:18:00,160
It's really a lot.

1494
01:18:00,160 --> 01:18:04,080
And also, Blumhouse announced the launch of Blumhouse Games

1495
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:07,280
that will do indie budget video games.

1496
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:10,640
They'll produce and publish for under 10 mil.

1497
01:18:12,560 --> 01:18:16,720
So I wonder if we might start seeing collaborations as well

1498
01:18:16,720 --> 01:18:19,760
or like, you know, other DVD spinoffs like Hooked on You,

1499
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:22,160
but on like the indie field.

1500
01:18:22,480 --> 01:18:22,980
Hmm.

1501
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:25,520
So I mean, there's like lots of,

1502
01:18:27,200 --> 01:18:30,400
lots of, you know, potential for this.

1503
01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:34,800
I really think that they've got the right people on this.

1504
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:37,520
And I mean, it's still early days, you know,

1505
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:39,760
they don't have a director or a screenwriter.

1506
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:43,600
So I mean, I would reckon we would see this

1507
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:45,600
maybe in two to three years.

1508
01:18:47,280 --> 01:18:49,440
And who knows where DVD will be by then,

1509
01:18:49,440 --> 01:18:52,320
although knowing behavior, it will still, you know,

1510
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:55,040
be a little bit broken, but very interesting.

1511
01:18:55,040 --> 01:18:57,600
And people will still be complaining about MMR.

1512
01:18:57,600 --> 01:19:00,160
That's also a very good point.

1513
01:19:00,160 --> 01:19:02,880
I mean, I don't want to speak this harshly,

1514
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:05,120
but this is the only sentence that comes to mind is,

1515
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:07,680
will DVD still be as relevant in the gaming world

1516
01:19:07,680 --> 01:19:10,640
by the time this movie hits or has the time to strike

1517
01:19:10,640 --> 01:19:13,200
when the iron is hot, so to speak, already passed?

1518
01:19:13,200 --> 01:19:15,120
People asked that question three years ago

1519
01:19:15,120 --> 01:19:16,000
when I started playing.

1520
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:18,480
Okay, fair answer.

1521
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:22,400
But actually, SSJ 100 Matt brings up a good point.

1522
01:19:22,400 --> 01:19:24,320
Michael Myers makes the most sense, really.

1523
01:19:24,320 --> 01:19:26,240
Blumhouse and Danny McBride have been doing

1524
01:19:26,240 --> 01:19:27,920
those recent Halloween movies.

1525
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:29,200
Oh, I did.

1526
01:19:29,200 --> 01:19:30,000
Oh, that's right.

1527
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,240
It is Blumhouse that did the reboot trilogy.

1528
01:19:32,240 --> 01:19:32,880
Okay.

1529
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:34,080
No, you're right.

1530
01:19:34,080 --> 01:19:34,960
I changed my answer.

1531
01:19:35,840 --> 01:19:36,640
Yeah, and they're doing,

1532
01:19:37,200 --> 01:19:39,600
he also says they're doing a new Exorcist movie.

1533
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:44,000
I doubt very seriously that we'll have, you know,

1534
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:45,280
a pea soup vomiting.

1535
01:19:46,640 --> 01:19:47,920
We already have.

1536
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:48,960
Oh my God.

1537
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:50,400
It just occurred to me, Rob.

1538
01:19:52,240 --> 01:19:55,840
If the plague might've been an attempt

1539
01:19:55,840 --> 01:20:00,400
to license the Exorcist and it didn't work.

1540
01:20:01,200 --> 01:20:02,080
Maybe, I don't know.

1541
01:20:02,080 --> 01:20:03,040
I don't know.

1542
01:20:03,040 --> 01:20:06,640
Although they're saying though that the new killer,

1543
01:20:06,640 --> 01:20:11,520
the Skull Merchant is a failed attempt to get Predator.

1544
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:13,280
Yeah, I've heard that too.

1545
01:20:13,360 --> 01:20:13,920
Yep.

1546
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:14,420
Yeah.

1547
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:15,680
Interesting.

1548
01:20:15,680 --> 01:20:19,280
But you know, you know, though the fandom,

1549
01:20:19,280 --> 01:20:21,520
the loyal fans stay loyal, right?

1550
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:22,080
Yep.

1551
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:24,400
And even people who walk away from the game,

1552
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:27,600
they, a lot of people come back.

1553
01:20:28,320 --> 01:20:29,120
I hope if they do-

1554
01:20:29,120 --> 01:20:30,080
There'll be something that comes out

1555
01:20:30,080 --> 01:20:30,880
that'll bring them back.

1556
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:33,200
It's interesting because with this movie,

1557
01:20:33,200 --> 01:20:35,600
I hope that it's very similar advice

1558
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:37,040
to what I just said to Square Enix.

1559
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:39,920
I hope they don't spend too much money on it.

1560
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:43,440
I hope they get, you know, some good up and coming,

1561
01:20:43,440 --> 01:20:46,080
but horror movies usually are not expensive.

1562
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:46,720
They are usually on the cheap to me.

1563
01:20:46,720 --> 01:20:48,960
I want to know what Tiger Claw is talking about DVDs.

1564
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:51,600
Cause we said DBD, Dead by Daylight.

1565
01:20:54,160 --> 01:20:54,720
All right.

1566
01:20:54,720 --> 01:20:55,200
Anyway.

1567
01:20:55,200 --> 01:20:57,200
I don't know if that's serious or a joke.

1568
01:20:57,200 --> 01:20:57,700
All right.

1569
01:20:58,240 --> 01:20:58,880
Let's move on.

1570
01:20:59,680 --> 01:21:00,800
Let's get to our next story,

1571
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:03,680
which is not as funny, unfortunately.

1572
01:21:03,680 --> 01:21:04,180
Loki.

1573
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:06,800
No, unfortunately not.

1574
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:11,600
So EA has laid off 200 Apex Legends testers

1575
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:15,200
and they did it over a remote meeting call.

1576
01:21:15,200 --> 01:21:17,840
So an unscheduled mandatory Zoom meeting.

1577
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:23,120
And so they had, actually with their

1578
01:21:23,920 --> 01:21:27,120
contracting agency, Magnet Global,

1579
01:21:27,840 --> 01:21:33,920
and basically that they were let go as part of that.

1580
01:21:33,920 --> 01:21:36,480
The test, these, you know, basically EAs come out

1581
01:21:36,480 --> 01:21:40,000
and they haven't made a comment yet regarding the layouts,

1582
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,880
but testing games is an integral part of delivering

1583
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:44,560
the best experiences to our players.

1584
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:46,000
They said that in PR speak.

1585
01:21:49,120 --> 01:21:52,640
But yeah, it's basically that they are testing team

1586
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:54,880
and ending testing execution.

1587
01:21:54,880 --> 01:21:58,720
That's been concentrated in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.

1588
01:21:58,720 --> 01:22:00,400
It says impacted services provided

1589
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:02,400
by our third party providers.

1590
01:22:02,400 --> 01:22:05,440
Our global team, inclusive of remote play testers

1591
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:07,040
across the United States,

1592
01:22:07,040 --> 01:22:09,760
enable us to increase hours per week and blah, blah, blah.

1593
01:22:11,040 --> 01:22:14,160
So maybe they're just, you know, reducing staff

1594
01:22:14,160 --> 01:22:15,520
for different testing.

1595
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:17,680
I don't know, but I don't know.

1596
01:22:17,680 --> 01:22:19,600
It's always bad news, especially when you do it,

1597
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:21,760
like over like a remote meeting like that.

1598
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:23,440
I guess I understand if they're all remote,

1599
01:22:23,440 --> 01:22:25,600
let me have them in the office to do it in person,

1600
01:22:25,600 --> 01:22:28,400
but something a little bit more personable probably

1601
01:22:28,400 --> 01:22:30,640
instead of just, okay, you're all let go.

1602
01:22:31,360 --> 01:22:34,800
Like at least an email or something, a letter.

1603
01:22:35,680 --> 01:22:36,180
Yeah.

1604
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:38,480
I don't know.

1605
01:22:38,480 --> 01:22:40,480
Like the one time I was laid off,

1606
01:22:40,480 --> 01:22:43,120
they had everybody together and made the announcement,

1607
01:22:43,120 --> 01:22:44,160
although I wasn't there for it

1608
01:22:44,160 --> 01:22:45,200
because I was on medical leave.

1609
01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:51,680
But I think that doing it by Zoom would be the equivalent

1610
01:22:51,680 --> 01:22:53,760
of calling an in-house company meeting.

1611
01:22:54,480 --> 01:22:56,160
I don't see any problem with it.

1612
01:22:57,280 --> 01:23:00,320
For remote where it still sucks that it's 200 people,

1613
01:23:00,640 --> 01:23:01,200
being let go.

1614
01:23:01,920 --> 01:23:03,920
But I mean that method because quite like,

1615
01:23:03,920 --> 01:23:05,680
and this is actually what happened with mine,

1616
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:10,080
is that when they sold the company

1617
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:12,880
and we were all outsourced, they gathered everyone,

1618
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:16,800
said it in person and letters came out like the following week.

1619
01:23:17,840 --> 01:23:21,360
And maybe that's where it feels a little oof

1620
01:23:21,360 --> 01:23:24,160
is because it was Zoom calls with 200 people

1621
01:23:24,160 --> 01:23:26,080
and even if it's 200 people in person,

1622
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:28,560
maybe it doesn't feel as personable.

1623
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:30,880
Whereas maybe even if they've done something as simple as

1624
01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:34,080
do it in a Zoom call with 10 people at a time.

1625
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:36,400
Yes, it's a lot more work to do it that way,

1626
01:23:36,400 --> 01:23:38,640
but it might feel a lot more personable

1627
01:23:38,640 --> 01:23:39,360
and you're able to be,

1628
01:23:39,360 --> 01:23:42,000
I mean, ideally you do it one at a time,

1629
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,480
but I understand there has to be a compromise here.

1630
01:23:45,200 --> 01:23:47,760
Where maybe do it team by team or something

1631
01:23:47,760 --> 01:23:49,440
where you can answer some of the questions,

1632
01:23:49,440 --> 01:23:50,880
concerns a little more directly

1633
01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:52,880
and at least have that human side of it,

1634
01:23:52,880 --> 01:23:55,520
which is impossible to get in a group of 200

1635
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:57,280
where people aren't really going to be able to ask questions,

1636
01:23:57,280 --> 01:23:58,400
but in chat.

1637
01:23:58,480 --> 01:24:03,680
So maybe that's where it feels a little bleh.

1638
01:24:04,720 --> 01:24:08,000
One actually good thing with a chat format like that

1639
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
is that it also helps you field questions.

1640
01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:13,200
Because a bunch of people are going to be asking

1641
01:24:13,200 --> 01:24:14,000
the same question,

1642
01:24:15,840 --> 01:24:17,760
so you can actually field questions

1643
01:24:18,320 --> 01:24:21,280
and lump in the similar questions together.

1644
01:24:21,440 --> 01:24:21,940
Mm-hmm.

1645
01:24:22,480 --> 01:24:25,360
You know, and you could also just,

1646
01:24:26,080 --> 01:24:30,080
it helps with efficiency and delivering the information

1647
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:31,920
because you can't really do that when,

1648
01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:34,800
you know, you have a big meeting,

1649
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:36,240
because I mean, in my experience,

1650
01:24:36,240 --> 01:24:37,840
like meetings like that,

1651
01:24:37,840 --> 01:24:39,120
like big business meetings,

1652
01:24:39,120 --> 01:24:41,600
don't really open the floor to questions.

1653
01:24:42,640 --> 01:24:44,800
They just say, get in touch with HR.

1654
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:46,020
Yeah.

1655
01:24:46,560 --> 01:24:50,160
So I could see this as actually being a good opportunity

1656
01:24:50,160 --> 01:24:52,160
to field questions about it as well.

1657
01:24:52,160 --> 01:24:52,660
Yeah.

1658
01:24:54,320 --> 01:24:55,440
I don't think it's as negative

1659
01:24:55,440 --> 01:24:56,640
as people are making it out to be.

1660
01:24:57,440 --> 01:24:57,840
Yeah.

1661
01:24:57,840 --> 01:24:58,880
Well, on the flip side-

1662
01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:00,000
Other than losing a job.

1663
01:25:00,960 --> 01:25:02,240
We have Activision,

1664
01:25:02,240 --> 01:25:04,800
who is now coming under fire

1665
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:07,200
by the Communications Workers of America,

1666
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:10,240
who filed charges against the publisher

1667
01:25:10,240 --> 01:25:14,240
in regards to firing two QA testers

1668
01:25:15,280 --> 01:25:18,560
over apparently the use of strong language.

1669
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:21,200
So two QA testers have expressed their outrage

1670
01:25:21,200 --> 01:25:25,040
using strong language in response to management

1671
01:25:25,040 --> 01:25:27,760
set up disciplinary meetings

1672
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:29,680
where both workers were fired.

1673
01:25:30,240 --> 01:25:33,120
And apparently the CWA is saying

1674
01:25:33,120 --> 01:25:35,120
that the use of outbursts and strong language

1675
01:25:35,120 --> 01:25:38,480
in the context of concerted activity by employees

1676
01:25:38,480 --> 01:25:41,920
was protected by the National Labor Relations Board

1677
01:25:43,520 --> 01:25:46,720
even up until 2020 where it was tested.

1678
01:25:47,280 --> 01:25:50,000
And then they said that Activision says,

1679
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:51,760
we don't allow employees to use profane

1680
01:25:51,760 --> 01:25:53,680
or abusive language against each other.

1681
01:25:55,520 --> 01:25:56,240
Really?

1682
01:25:56,240 --> 01:25:56,960
Really, you don't?

1683
01:25:57,840 --> 01:25:58,340
Right.

1684
01:25:58,340 --> 01:25:59,840
We should listen to Michael first.

1685
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:02,480
We're disappointed that the CWA advocates

1686
01:26:02,480 --> 01:26:04,160
this type of behavior.

1687
01:26:04,720 --> 01:26:06,000
It sounds like an excuse.

1688
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:07,600
Were they trying to unionize?

1689
01:26:07,600 --> 01:26:09,120
I mean, I could see something like that.

1690
01:26:09,520 --> 01:26:18,880
So yeah, more fire, it's more of the same, it seems like.

1691
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:26,880
More of Activision finding creative ways to fire people,

1692
01:26:28,080 --> 01:26:30,400
especially those protesting their practices.

1693
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:36,880
Well, now that's a good question.

1694
01:26:37,520 --> 01:26:40,480
Well, now that's just shady,

1695
01:26:40,480 --> 01:26:42,800
but unfortunately completely unsurprising

1696
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:44,640
coming from Activision, to be quite honest.

1697
01:26:44,640 --> 01:26:48,240
So hopefully the acquisition of their company

1698
01:26:48,240 --> 01:26:49,600
can't happen soon enough.

1699
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:50,640
Clean house, you know?

1700
01:26:50,640 --> 01:26:51,140
Yeah.

1701
01:26:51,680 --> 01:26:52,400
At the top.

1702
01:26:52,400 --> 01:26:54,240
At the top is where the layoffs need to happen.

1703
01:26:55,440 --> 01:26:57,200
All right, moving on.

1704
01:26:57,200 --> 01:26:59,360
Let's talk about Final Fantasy XVI.

1705
01:26:59,360 --> 01:27:00,640
I brought it up later in the show,

1706
01:27:00,640 --> 01:27:01,920
but it was actually in the news,

1707
01:27:01,920 --> 01:27:03,600
or excuse me, earlier in the show I brought it up.

1708
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:05,280
But it's been in the news quite a bit this week

1709
01:27:05,280 --> 01:27:07,600
because some press previews happened this week

1710
01:27:07,600 --> 01:27:11,040
where I think folks got to play a several hour demo of it,

1711
01:27:11,040 --> 01:27:12,720
probably in a controlled environment,

1712
01:27:12,720 --> 01:27:14,960
and kind of got to experience a lot of the battle,

1713
01:27:14,960 --> 01:27:16,000
kind of got to play with that.

1714
01:27:16,960 --> 01:27:18,000
Because I've been out,

1715
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,160
I have not caught up on the videos of it.

1716
01:27:20,160 --> 01:27:22,240
I've just kind of watched a little bit.

1717
01:27:22,240 --> 01:27:24,800
So I used to watch Skill Up.

1718
01:27:24,800 --> 01:27:27,840
Maybe I should look some up and get some live thoughts here.

1719
01:27:29,840 --> 01:27:31,600
So they flew them out to Japan

1720
01:27:31,600 --> 01:27:33,520
to play a few different sections of the game.

1721
01:27:33,520 --> 01:27:37,360
So one of it was a bit early on in the game

1722
01:27:37,360 --> 01:27:39,520
that kind of focused on,

1723
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:43,120
because I guess it jumps between you as like a teenager

1724
01:27:43,120 --> 01:27:45,360
and you as kind of like grown up as well.

1725
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:48,640
And so it started off like as a teenager

1726
01:27:48,640 --> 01:27:51,200
where it's more of like a combat tutorial type thing,

1727
01:27:51,200 --> 01:27:52,960
kind of getting used to that.

1728
01:27:52,960 --> 01:27:56,640
And then they threw into another section of the game

1729
01:27:56,640 --> 01:27:58,000
where it was just basic combat.

1730
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:01,600
And then one of the, I forget what they call it now,

1731
01:28:01,600 --> 01:28:06,240
the, not idols, but it's basically where the giant

1732
01:28:06,240 --> 01:28:08,160
like a kaiju battle type thing,

1733
01:28:08,160 --> 01:28:10,080
where they're both the summons or whatever,

1734
01:28:10,080 --> 01:28:12,080
and they were doing a battle like that.

1735
01:28:12,640 --> 01:28:14,960
So they had those three sections of the game to play

1736
01:28:15,680 --> 01:28:17,440
to kind of get a taste of it.

1737
01:28:18,640 --> 01:28:20,480
Okay, so I actually, while you've been talking,

1738
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:21,040
I pulled up,

1739
01:28:21,040 --> 01:28:23,280
because I actually have not watched any of this at all.

1740
01:28:23,280 --> 01:28:24,480
So I actually just pulled up.

1741
01:28:24,480 --> 01:28:25,280
I went to YouTube.

1742
01:28:25,280 --> 01:28:28,640
Of course, some of the extended gameplay stuff

1743
01:28:28,640 --> 01:28:29,840
has hit YouTube.

1744
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:33,120
Interesting, because you know what it kind of evokes to me

1745
01:28:33,120 --> 01:28:36,240
at first is that recent Strangers of Paradise spinoff

1746
01:28:36,240 --> 01:28:36,880
a little bit.

1747
01:28:36,880 --> 01:28:38,960
It's kind of what I'm feeling a little bit from this,

1748
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:39,600
but we'll see.

1749
01:28:39,600 --> 01:28:40,960
I mean, here's the thing.

1750
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:44,800
Well, you know who's designing the game designer?

1751
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:46,640
Oh yeah, the guy from Devil May Cry and all that.

1752
01:28:46,640 --> 01:28:47,360
Yeah, exactly.

1753
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:49,440
So it plays very similar to that.

1754
01:28:49,440 --> 01:28:53,280
Yeah, so I'm curious about it.

1755
01:28:53,280 --> 01:28:56,640
And the reality is Final Fantasy has been a little rooted

1756
01:28:56,640 --> 01:29:00,400
more in action between 15 and the seven remake.

1757
01:29:00,400 --> 01:29:02,400
You know, it's just kind of the direction it's been going.

1758
01:29:02,400 --> 01:29:05,600
But I'm still, you know, there's certainly elements

1759
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:08,640
of the classic Final Fantasies, the games I see in here.

1760
01:29:08,640 --> 01:29:09,360
So we'll see.

1761
01:29:09,360 --> 01:29:11,520
I mean, I'm not sure I'm really going to know

1762
01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:13,200
until I get my hands on it for myself

1763
01:29:13,200 --> 01:29:15,280
and make my own perceptions.

1764
01:29:15,280 --> 01:29:20,160
But there's definitely like graphically, very yes.

1765
01:29:20,800 --> 01:29:22,640
Like very yes, graphically.

1766
01:29:22,640 --> 01:29:25,600
Like I get like kind of like an Elden Ring, you know,

1767
01:29:25,600 --> 01:29:27,760
meets Final Fantasy type of vibe from it.

1768
01:29:27,760 --> 01:29:30,560
And I think it's going to look really good when it comes out.

1769
01:29:30,560 --> 01:29:31,440
We'll see.

1770
01:29:31,440 --> 01:29:33,680
But anyway, not only did the press preview happen,

1771
01:29:33,680 --> 01:29:38,800
but there were some talk about how long does the story take?

1772
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:40,560
How long of a game does this take to get through?

1773
01:29:41,440 --> 01:29:44,560
And it's going to take about 35 hours to complete.

1774
01:29:45,520 --> 01:29:47,520
Apparently this will actually double

1775
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:49,040
when you do side content.

1776
01:29:49,040 --> 01:29:52,480
There will be 11 hours worth of cut scenes.

1777
01:29:52,480 --> 01:29:54,320
Well, after all, it is a Final Fantasy game.

1778
01:29:54,320 --> 01:29:55,680
So I can't say I'm that surprised.

1779
01:29:56,720 --> 01:29:58,560
The main story will take 35 hours to beat.

1780
01:29:58,560 --> 01:29:59,840
But Yoshida added to that.

1781
01:29:59,840 --> 01:30:02,880
If you do 100% completion, so you do all the cut scenes,

1782
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:05,200
you're looking at 70 to 80 hours.

1783
01:30:05,200 --> 01:30:07,440
The main story was originally going to be 20 hours.

1784
01:30:07,440 --> 01:30:08,320
Don't make any plans.

1785
01:30:08,320 --> 01:30:09,360
Yeah, don't make plans.

1786
01:30:09,360 --> 01:30:11,360
But this number increased during development,

1787
01:30:11,360 --> 01:30:13,360
which isn't surprising either.

1788
01:30:14,080 --> 01:30:15,920
So yeah, this number does not include cut scene

1789
01:30:15,920 --> 01:30:17,280
and side quests and all of that.

1790
01:30:17,280 --> 01:30:19,120
So there will be lots and lots.

1791
01:30:20,720 --> 01:30:23,520
Yoshida did say, and this is not a great

1792
01:30:24,640 --> 01:30:26,960
quote here, but he has said that the team has been working

1793
01:30:26,960 --> 01:30:30,960
to death in order to get the game finished by summer 2023.

1794
01:30:30,960 --> 01:30:32,480
I might have chose my words differently,

1795
01:30:32,480 --> 01:30:33,920
but it is what it is.

1796
01:30:35,200 --> 01:30:39,600
So yeah, it is set to launch in June, later in June.

1797
01:30:39,600 --> 01:30:44,160
So I'm trying to look at this without the ad blocking

1798
01:30:44,160 --> 01:30:46,320
things there, but that is, oh, that's the whole,

1799
01:30:46,320 --> 01:30:48,800
yeah, they have the summon versus summon fight.

1800
01:30:48,800 --> 01:30:50,560
So it looks like in this particular fight,

1801
01:30:50,560 --> 01:30:53,520
you're actually controlling either Garuda

1802
01:30:53,520 --> 01:30:55,920
or maybe Ifrit, I can't tell in this fight,

1803
01:30:57,040 --> 01:30:59,120
but you're actually doing like a summon versus summon.

1804
01:30:59,120 --> 01:31:00,000
It does look pretty cool.

1805
01:31:00,640 --> 01:31:04,240
So it's got a lot of flourish to it.

1806
01:31:06,160 --> 01:31:08,320
I mean, there's no, I was going to buy this game

1807
01:31:08,320 --> 01:31:10,400
the minute they announced that Creative Business Unit 3

1808
01:31:10,400 --> 01:31:11,280
was working on it.

1809
01:31:11,280 --> 01:31:13,440
So we'll see.

1810
01:31:13,440 --> 01:31:15,200
And I know I'll be streaming a lot of it as well.

1811
01:31:17,040 --> 01:31:20,720
Let's see, is there some comments in chat about the length?

1812
01:31:20,720 --> 01:31:23,760
DJ Rama S says, 35 hours, that's kind of light.

1813
01:31:23,760 --> 01:31:26,240
Mike Def says, I don't need 100 plus hour experiences.

1814
01:31:26,240 --> 01:31:27,520
Please keep it short and sweet.

1815
01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:32,160
I actually think 35 hours is kind of on the longer end

1816
01:31:32,160 --> 01:31:33,920
of where video games are at these days.

1817
01:31:34,480 --> 01:31:39,120
Maybe not like something a little more retro inspired

1818
01:31:39,120 --> 01:31:42,160
that has a lot of quests and stuff to, but keep in mind,

1819
01:31:42,160 --> 01:31:45,360
they all are also saying, if you do all the side quests,

1820
01:31:45,360 --> 01:31:47,920
which many people I know that play Final Fantasy do,

1821
01:31:48,960 --> 01:31:50,320
it's going to be a lot longer.

1822
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:54,960
And so I'm not concerned about the time as much.

1823
01:31:54,960 --> 01:31:56,880
I mean, but I reserve to change my mind

1824
01:31:56,880 --> 01:31:58,480
once I have actually played the games.

1825
01:31:59,040 --> 01:32:00,960
Questbuster says, so the previews I've watched,

1826
01:32:00,960 --> 01:32:02,640
my impressions is that it's Final Fantasy

1827
01:32:02,640 --> 01:32:04,240
with the Devil May Cry feel to it.

1828
01:32:04,240 --> 01:32:07,040
You can swap between icon powers during battle.

1829
01:32:07,600 --> 01:32:10,240
Questbuster also says, I love me those side quests.

1830
01:32:10,240 --> 01:32:11,760
I went overboard with as many of those

1831
01:32:11,760 --> 01:32:13,360
in Final Fantasy 15 as possible

1832
01:32:13,360 --> 01:32:15,600
and maxed Noctis's party out.

1833
01:32:15,600 --> 01:32:18,160
Well, apparently like side quests, DLC and all that,

1834
01:32:18,160 --> 01:32:21,840
that's really the way to get the full Final Fantasy 15 experience.

1835
01:32:21,840 --> 01:32:23,680
I just hope this game, you know,

1836
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:25,520
especially with the comment about this,

1837
01:32:25,520 --> 01:32:27,440
basically openly admitting they're crunching.

1838
01:32:28,240 --> 01:32:30,320
I hope with comments like that,

1839
01:32:30,320 --> 01:32:35,840
this game is a fully finished, fully realized product.

1840
01:32:35,840 --> 01:32:38,160
That's going to be the part that's disappointing to me.

1841
01:32:38,160 --> 01:32:41,840
As long as it's 35 solid fucking hours, then great.

1842
01:32:41,840 --> 01:32:44,400
But if it's 35 hours where it really feels like

1843
01:32:44,400 --> 01:32:47,840
another 15 are missing, which is what Final Fantasy 15 felt like,

1844
01:32:47,840 --> 01:32:48,880
I'm going to have some issues.

1845
01:32:49,920 --> 01:32:52,640
And I am willing to hold this game,

1846
01:32:53,520 --> 01:32:55,680
you know, accountable in the critical sense

1847
01:32:55,680 --> 01:32:58,560
because just because I have a fondness

1848
01:32:58,560 --> 01:33:00,560
of Creative Business Unit 3's previous game,

1849
01:33:01,120 --> 01:33:03,920
I'm probably going to be harsher than most people

1850
01:33:03,920 --> 01:33:05,680
on this game when it comes out, but we'll see.

1851
01:33:06,560 --> 01:33:08,320
I'll be playing it live for sure.

1852
01:33:08,320 --> 01:33:09,360
Absolutely.

1853
01:33:09,360 --> 01:33:10,320
Whenever it comes out.

1854
01:33:11,360 --> 01:33:11,760
All right.

1855
01:33:11,760 --> 01:33:13,600
In the meantime, let's go to Dark Sakura

1856
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:15,840
and I'm going to step away from keyboard real quick.

1857
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:16,340
Sorry.

1858
01:33:17,300 --> 01:33:18,260
You see how it is.

1859
01:33:18,260 --> 01:33:19,300
I talk and you leave.

1860
01:33:19,860 --> 01:33:21,380
I just need hydration.

1861
01:33:21,380 --> 01:33:22,020
Forgive me.

1862
01:33:22,580 --> 01:33:23,140
It's okay.

1863
01:33:24,660 --> 01:33:29,860
Anyway, though, for fans of games that make you hate life

1864
01:33:29,860 --> 01:33:34,420
and question your choices, Elden Ring is having an expansion

1865
01:33:34,420 --> 01:33:36,580
called Shadow of Erdtree.

1866
01:33:37,540 --> 01:33:39,220
It is currently in development,

1867
01:33:39,220 --> 01:33:42,900
according to Bandai Namco and From Software.

1868
01:33:43,460 --> 01:33:46,500
Um, the teaser says thus,

1869
01:33:47,220 --> 01:33:50,420
Rise Tarnished and let us walk a new path together.

1870
01:33:50,420 --> 01:33:52,900
An upcoming expansion for Elden Ring,

1871
01:33:52,900 --> 01:33:55,620
Shadow of the Erdtree is currently in development.

1872
01:33:55,620 --> 01:33:57,940
We hope you look forward to new adventures

1873
01:33:57,940 --> 01:33:58,900
in the Lands Between.

1874
01:33:59,620 --> 01:34:02,820
So yeah, there you go.

1875
01:34:03,540 --> 01:34:07,060
Um, there's not really a whole lot of information

1876
01:34:07,060 --> 01:34:07,700
out about it.

1877
01:34:07,700 --> 01:34:09,380
I mean, I don't play Elden Ring,

1878
01:34:10,100 --> 01:34:11,860
although I was tempted and then I realized

1879
01:34:11,860 --> 01:34:12,740
I don't hate myself.

1880
01:34:13,300 --> 01:34:18,740
So, but I mean, if, if people are looking forward to it,

1881
01:34:18,740 --> 01:34:19,940
then I'm happy for y'all.

1882
01:34:22,580 --> 01:34:23,080
Yeah.

1883
01:34:24,340 --> 01:34:25,940
Did you play Elden Ring?

1884
01:34:25,940 --> 01:34:28,980
Nope, there's no way I'm gonna play Elden Ring.

1885
01:34:28,980 --> 01:34:32,180
Yeah, I have friends that like are super into it

1886
01:34:32,180 --> 01:34:34,580
and, you know, die and die and die and die.

1887
01:34:34,580 --> 01:34:37,860
And me, I just be like, no and no and no and no.

1888
01:34:37,860 --> 01:34:41,460
You know, not, not me, no.

1889
01:34:42,420 --> 01:34:45,140
It's like, I don't, I mean,

1890
01:34:46,180 --> 01:34:48,260
but people like those Souls games, you know?

1891
01:34:49,220 --> 01:34:53,700
Um, oh, Mike Duff says it's, it's been considered

1892
01:34:53,700 --> 01:34:56,100
one of the most accessible Souls games.

1893
01:34:56,740 --> 01:35:00,980
And I mean, I would be that person that plays like

1894
01:35:00,980 --> 01:35:03,620
some sort of magic user that stands on a cliff

1895
01:35:03,620 --> 01:35:06,580
and shoots, you know, whatever happens to be

1896
01:35:06,580 --> 01:35:07,700
in firing range.

1897
01:35:07,700 --> 01:35:09,780
Which I believe is the easy way, quote unquote,

1898
01:35:09,780 --> 01:35:11,460
using my coin figures, easy way to play it.

1899
01:35:14,020 --> 01:35:16,100
And I like, I've gone in and like watched videos,

1900
01:35:16,100 --> 01:35:18,980
you know, like I watched, uh, the ending with

1901
01:35:18,980 --> 01:35:20,260
whatever the moon lady is.

1902
01:35:22,500 --> 01:35:26,260
Um, that was kind of cool, but, uh, I don't know.

1903
01:35:26,260 --> 01:35:29,860
I mean, I'm happy for Elden Ring fans getting more content.

1904
01:35:29,860 --> 01:35:32,980
I will be content to watch you play it and not play it myself.

1905
01:35:32,980 --> 01:35:36,820
Yeah. I thought you'd, a lot of DVD streamers we know,

1906
01:35:36,820 --> 01:35:38,820
especially the one you had lunch with today,

1907
01:35:38,820 --> 01:35:40,660
I have started kind of playing this in some

1908
01:35:40,660 --> 01:35:42,580
DVD downtime lately.

1909
01:35:42,580 --> 01:35:45,220
So, um, definitely a game that even a year after

1910
01:35:45,220 --> 01:35:47,140
it's been released is, uh, you know, kind of

1911
01:35:47,780 --> 01:35:49,460
getting new fans showing up.

1912
01:35:49,460 --> 01:35:50,420
So, yep.

1913
01:35:52,020 --> 01:35:52,420
Cool.

1914
01:35:52,420 --> 01:35:53,140
Yeah.

1915
01:35:53,140 --> 01:35:53,460
All right.

1916
01:35:53,460 --> 01:35:54,900
Um, moving on Loki.

1917
01:35:56,420 --> 01:35:56,740
Yeah.

1918
01:35:56,740 --> 01:35:59,220
So just kind of follow up to a story that we talked

1919
01:35:59,220 --> 01:36:00,580
about a while ago.

1920
01:36:01,060 --> 01:36:04,980
Yuji Naka getting in trouble with some insider trading.

1921
01:36:04,980 --> 01:36:09,300
Well now, apparently during the court case, um, it has been,

1922
01:36:10,260 --> 01:36:12,660
he has made the comment that there is no doubt.

1923
01:36:12,660 --> 01:36:15,940
I knew the facts about the game before it was made

1924
01:36:15,940 --> 01:36:17,620
public and bought the stock.

1925
01:36:18,500 --> 01:36:20,580
And that's not necessarily admission of like,

1926
01:36:20,580 --> 01:36:23,780
I did insider trading, but you got all the ingredients

1927
01:36:23,780 --> 01:36:24,980
for insider trading.

1928
01:36:24,980 --> 01:36:27,540
It almost sounds like he's pleading guilty,

1929
01:36:27,540 --> 01:36:29,940
but he hasn't pled guilty yet.

1930
01:36:29,940 --> 01:36:32,020
Well, at least he's owning up to it.

1931
01:36:32,020 --> 01:36:33,540
That's more than most people do.

1932
01:36:33,540 --> 01:36:34,500
I'll give him credit for that.

1933
01:36:37,060 --> 01:36:37,560
Yep.

1934
01:36:38,260 --> 01:36:44,500
So, um, I guess, I mean, this is a silly question to ask,

1935
01:36:44,500 --> 01:36:46,740
but what I, cause I was gonna ask, is this the end

1936
01:36:46,740 --> 01:36:47,860
of his gaming career?

1937
01:36:47,860 --> 01:36:49,780
And abs, obviously the answer is yes.

1938
01:36:49,780 --> 01:36:50,580
Oh, you think?

1939
01:36:50,580 --> 01:36:50,820
No.

1940
01:36:51,860 --> 01:36:52,900
I don't think it's the end of his gaming career.

1941
01:36:52,900 --> 01:36:53,940
He's gonna go to jail.

1942
01:36:54,740 --> 01:36:55,780
Well, you know what?

1943
01:36:55,780 --> 01:36:58,020
Is he going to jail or is he getting a fine?

1944
01:36:58,820 --> 01:36:59,620
That's, you know what?

1945
01:36:59,620 --> 01:37:01,380
Jail didn't end Martha Stewart's career.

1946
01:37:02,180 --> 01:37:03,620
So maybe, maybe you're right.

1947
01:37:03,620 --> 01:37:06,580
Maybe, maybe this isn't going to be the end and we don't know.

1948
01:37:06,580 --> 01:37:06,900
You're right.

1949
01:37:06,900 --> 01:37:07,860
He might not get jail.

1950
01:37:07,860 --> 01:37:10,100
He might just get a fine, especially if he's admitting

1951
01:37:10,100 --> 01:37:10,900
to guilt.

1952
01:37:10,900 --> 01:37:12,900
I don't know because I don't know the legal system.

1953
01:37:12,900 --> 01:37:14,820
I barely understand the legal system here.

1954
01:37:14,820 --> 01:37:16,180
I'm not going to try to understand the legal system

1955
01:37:16,180 --> 01:37:17,060
in Japan.

1956
01:37:17,060 --> 01:37:21,380
I just know certain things are viewed differently in the

1957
01:37:21,380 --> 01:37:23,380
culture than others, and that can go either way.

1958
01:37:24,660 --> 01:37:25,540
So we'll see.

1959
01:37:25,860 --> 01:37:30,180
Quest Buster in chat says after Ballad Wonderland and now

1960
01:37:30,180 --> 01:37:30,820
jail.

1961
01:37:30,820 --> 01:37:34,500
Well, entire class says insider trading isn't a felony,

1962
01:37:34,500 --> 01:37:34,740
right?

1963
01:37:34,740 --> 01:37:36,020
Well, Martha Stewart went to jail.

1964
01:37:37,220 --> 01:37:41,620
So granted, many people feel they were just trying to make

1965
01:37:41,620 --> 01:37:44,020
an example of her, but she does.

1966
01:37:44,020 --> 01:37:48,260
I mean, name a better duo than her and Snoop Dogg.

1967
01:37:48,260 --> 01:37:48,980
I'll wait.

1968
01:37:48,980 --> 01:37:50,900
Like, there really isn't one.

1969
01:37:50,900 --> 01:37:53,780
So I mean, her career is in a great place.

1970
01:37:53,780 --> 01:37:54,740
All things considered.

1971
01:37:54,740 --> 01:37:55,700
So I don't know.

1972
01:37:55,700 --> 01:37:59,220
It'd be interesting to see what happens with Yuji Naka

1973
01:37:59,220 --> 01:38:00,100
artistically.

1974
01:38:01,620 --> 01:38:02,020
Wow.

1975
01:38:02,020 --> 01:38:07,140
Dejirama S says if the creator of Rurouni Kenshin, who is

1976
01:38:07,140 --> 01:38:10,420
caught with child pornography, can get away with no jail time

1977
01:38:10,420 --> 01:38:11,300
and pay a fine.

1978
01:38:11,940 --> 01:38:12,260
Wow.

1979
01:38:12,900 --> 01:38:15,140
Yuji Naka is just going to get a slap on the wrist.

1980
01:38:16,500 --> 01:38:16,740
Wow.

1981
01:38:18,340 --> 01:38:21,220
Phil of Nine says Martha Stewart, the original stunt queen

1982
01:38:22,180 --> 01:38:25,700
and the only host of The Apprentice that has gone to jail

1983
01:38:25,700 --> 01:38:26,260
so far.

1984
01:38:28,500 --> 01:38:29,140
But we'll see.

1985
01:38:30,900 --> 01:38:34,260
And she went to jail and paid her dues.

1986
01:38:34,260 --> 01:38:36,980
I mean, I don't know.

1987
01:38:36,980 --> 01:38:38,740
I don't know enough facts about that case.

1988
01:38:38,740 --> 01:38:41,300
I don't want to sit here and go, Martha Stewart should or

1989
01:38:41,300 --> 01:38:42,900
shouldn't have gone to jail because I don't really know.

1990
01:38:42,900 --> 01:38:45,300
But it does seem like they made an example of her.

1991
01:38:45,300 --> 01:38:49,620
I do get the impression that she has done things that maybe

1992
01:38:49,620 --> 01:38:51,060
some other people should do.

1993
01:38:51,620 --> 01:38:54,420
Other people that have hosted The Apprentice television show

1994
01:38:54,420 --> 01:38:58,740
who have done other things that are worse than what Martha

1995
01:38:58,740 --> 01:38:59,300
Stewart did.

1996
01:39:00,500 --> 01:39:01,540
But what do I know?

1997
01:39:01,540 --> 01:39:03,540
I'm just some guy on the internet with a podcast.

1998
01:39:05,460 --> 01:39:06,100
All right.

1999
01:39:06,100 --> 01:39:07,780
Anyway, let's move on.

2000
01:39:08,580 --> 01:39:11,460
And for those watching live on Twitch, I see we have a special

2001
01:39:11,460 --> 01:39:12,340
guest star tonight.

2002
01:39:13,060 --> 01:39:14,580
We have Her Highness.

2003
01:39:14,580 --> 01:39:15,060
Yes.

2004
01:39:15,060 --> 01:39:16,180
Ms. Middlesbittittles.

2005
01:39:16,500 --> 01:39:21,060
For those listening on the podcast, Dark Sakura has a cat

2006
01:39:21,060 --> 01:39:23,860
not on her lap, like, literally in her arms next to the

2007
01:39:23,860 --> 01:39:24,740
microphone right now.

2008
01:39:24,740 --> 01:39:29,220
And unlike my cats, Middles is loving this attention.

2009
01:39:29,860 --> 01:39:31,220
No, she's tolerating it.

2010
01:39:31,220 --> 01:39:31,780
She's tolerating.

2011
01:39:31,780 --> 01:39:32,980
She's tolerating this attention.

2012
01:39:32,980 --> 01:39:35,620
I took her out of her warm spot because I wanted her to be

2013
01:39:35,620 --> 01:39:36,340
a celebrity.

2014
01:39:36,340 --> 01:39:36,840
Yeah.

2015
01:39:37,540 --> 01:39:38,100
You want down?

2016
01:39:38,820 --> 01:39:39,780
You want down?

2017
01:39:39,780 --> 01:39:40,280
All right.

2018
01:39:41,940 --> 01:39:43,060
Put me down, human.

2019
01:39:43,060 --> 01:39:44,180
And time was up.

2020
01:39:44,980 --> 01:39:45,300
All right.

2021
01:39:45,300 --> 01:39:48,180
Well, speaking of pets, let's talk about Pokemon, because

2022
01:39:48,180 --> 01:39:49,860
Pokemon Day happened this week.

2023
01:39:49,860 --> 01:39:52,740
And with that came a Pokemon Presents stream.

2024
01:39:53,460 --> 01:39:56,580
And so they talked about what is happening in Pokemon.

2025
01:39:56,580 --> 01:39:59,380
And one of the biggest pieces of news that came out is that,

2026
01:39:59,380 --> 01:40:02,100
yes, there is DLC coming for Scarlet and Violet.

2027
01:40:02,100 --> 01:40:04,660
Of course, there's DLC coming from Scarlet and Violet.

2028
01:40:05,380 --> 01:40:08,340
That will be coming out soon.

2029
01:40:08,340 --> 01:40:10,020
I'm trying to see where the dates are for that.

2030
01:40:12,340 --> 01:40:13,460
Fall and winter.

2031
01:40:13,460 --> 01:40:13,940
Thank you.

2032
01:40:13,940 --> 01:40:16,500
Fall and winter for the two pieces of DLC that are coming

2033
01:40:16,500 --> 01:40:17,620
to Scarlet and Violet.

2034
01:40:18,180 --> 01:40:20,980
Pokemon Go is also going to connect to Scarlet and Violet.

2035
01:40:20,980 --> 01:40:22,740
And I believe that started this week.

2036
01:40:22,740 --> 01:40:24,500
I haven't checked out that functionality yet, but I know

2037
01:40:24,500 --> 01:40:28,580
it has to do a gimme ghoul and his release in Pokemon Go.

2038
01:40:28,580 --> 01:40:30,980
So I'll have to check out that at some point.

2039
01:40:30,980 --> 01:40:33,300
There's also more terror raids coming as well.

2040
01:40:34,900 --> 01:40:37,540
The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero.

2041
01:40:37,540 --> 01:40:39,780
That's the name of the DLC for that.

2042
01:40:39,780 --> 01:40:40,260
Interesting.

2043
01:40:40,260 --> 01:40:41,540
So it's not two different pieces.

2044
01:40:41,540 --> 01:40:43,140
It's just part one and two.

2045
01:40:43,140 --> 01:40:45,940
Also big news from the Pokemon Presents.

2046
01:40:45,940 --> 01:40:47,140
Pokemon Sleep.

2047
01:40:47,140 --> 01:40:47,860
It's back.

2048
01:40:47,860 --> 01:40:48,500
It's real.

2049
01:40:48,500 --> 01:40:49,460
It's coming.

2050
01:40:49,460 --> 01:40:52,180
Pokemon Sleep is happening, and there's going to be a new

2051
01:40:52,180 --> 01:40:54,900
device for it even called the Pokemon Go Plus.

2052
01:40:56,500 --> 01:40:59,220
It's the Pokemon Go Plus Plus.

2053
01:41:00,340 --> 01:41:02,820
It's an ATM machine machine, literally.

2054
01:41:05,220 --> 01:41:06,980
The Trace Buster Buster.

2055
01:41:08,020 --> 01:41:09,780
But anyway, it's coming.

2056
01:41:09,780 --> 01:41:12,900
And if you wanted to get one too late, they're already sold

2057
01:41:12,900 --> 01:41:15,300
out everywhere because this is the way Nintendo products

2058
01:41:15,300 --> 01:41:16,740
and Nintendo affiliated.

2059
01:41:16,740 --> 01:41:19,940
In this case, products tend to go, but it will actually

2060
01:41:19,940 --> 01:41:21,300
measure your sleep and all that.

2061
01:41:21,300 --> 01:41:24,500
And I think you get a Snorlax in Pokemon Go with, like, a

2062
01:41:24,500 --> 01:41:25,700
sleepy time hat or something.

2063
01:41:25,700 --> 01:41:26,900
If you get one of these.

2064
01:41:26,900 --> 01:41:27,700
I don't know.

2065
01:41:27,700 --> 01:41:30,180
It sounded like a lot of extra crap to me.

2066
01:41:30,180 --> 01:41:31,940
I'm also I still don't.

2067
01:41:31,940 --> 01:41:35,060
I'm not sure I understand the point of Pokemon Sleep other

2068
01:41:35,060 --> 01:41:40,420
than Nintendo wants sleep data of children and adults who

2069
01:41:40,420 --> 01:41:44,500
like Pokemon across the US and Canada and other places.

2070
01:41:44,500 --> 01:41:46,500
For some reason, I don't know why they want to harvest that

2071
01:41:46,500 --> 01:41:48,660
sleep data, but they're going to get it.

2072
01:41:48,660 --> 01:41:50,660
And that's going to be interesting for whatever they

2073
01:41:50,660 --> 01:41:52,820
might be cooking up in the future.

2074
01:41:52,820 --> 01:41:57,300
So also some other things if you're big fans of the Pokemon

2075
01:41:57,300 --> 01:42:00,980
series, such as Zacian is coming to Pokemon Unite.

2076
01:42:01,540 --> 01:42:04,260
There is a new Netflix and Pokemon venture called Pokemon

2077
01:42:04,260 --> 01:42:05,860
Concierge that's coming.

2078
01:42:05,860 --> 01:42:08,340
There's a new set of Pokemon cards coming, but they'll be

2079
01:42:08,340 --> 01:42:11,060
announced more at the Pokemon World Championship and the

2080
01:42:11,060 --> 01:42:16,100
Pokemon Master Sex or the Masters EX.

2081
01:42:16,100 --> 01:42:20,180
But everyone calls it Pokemon Master Sex for Pokemon Master

2082
01:42:20,180 --> 01:42:20,740
Sex.

2083
01:42:20,740 --> 01:42:24,100
Leon and Charizard will be back in that.

2084
01:42:24,100 --> 01:42:24,820
So there's that.

2085
01:42:24,820 --> 01:42:27,220
And what's that?

2086
01:42:29,220 --> 01:42:30,500
You say the Lord, I'm done.

2087
01:42:30,500 --> 01:42:31,000
Bye.

2088
01:42:33,220 --> 01:42:33,860
People.

2089
01:42:33,860 --> 01:42:34,900
Yeah, yeah, I know.

2090
01:42:35,860 --> 01:42:36,260
All right.

2091
01:42:37,220 --> 01:42:40,180
S.J. 100 Matt says it's gamifying health and wellness,

2092
01:42:40,180 --> 01:42:41,300
and there's a market for that.

2093
01:42:41,300 --> 01:42:41,700
Sure.

2094
01:42:41,700 --> 01:42:42,820
And I eat that stuff up.

2095
01:42:43,700 --> 01:42:46,180
And will I play Pokemon sleep?

2096
01:42:46,180 --> 01:42:46,900
Probably.

2097
01:42:47,460 --> 01:42:50,020
Will I recognize that there is something potentially

2098
01:42:50,020 --> 01:42:53,940
problematic with me being so open with me sharing my sleep

2099
01:42:53,940 --> 01:42:54,660
data?

2100
01:42:54,660 --> 01:42:55,700
Probably.

2101
01:42:55,700 --> 01:42:56,820
But you know what?

2102
01:42:56,820 --> 01:42:59,860
I've been given way worse to Niantic for years.

2103
01:43:01,060 --> 01:43:04,100
So whatever.

2104
01:43:04,900 --> 01:43:07,460
Keep making the Pokemon cute, and who cares?

2105
01:43:08,100 --> 01:43:10,420
All right, moving on.

2106
01:43:10,420 --> 01:43:15,220
Let's go back to a simpler time when games weren't harvesting

2107
01:43:15,220 --> 01:43:19,140
all of our data in a favorite segment we like to do here

2108
01:43:19,140 --> 01:43:20,500
on Orange Lounge Radio.

2109
01:43:31,060 --> 01:43:34,100
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time,

2110
01:43:34,100 --> 01:43:37,460
where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic

2111
01:43:37,460 --> 01:43:38,820
and tell you about it.

2112
01:43:38,820 --> 01:43:41,460
It's time for the classic game of the week.

2113
01:43:42,340 --> 01:43:43,460
OK, let me see.

2114
01:43:43,460 --> 01:43:46,100
I think I have an audio cue for tonight's game.

2115
01:43:46,660 --> 01:43:48,580
Let's see if I get this timed right with the title

2116
01:43:48,580 --> 01:43:49,300
screen coming up.

2117
01:43:51,140 --> 01:43:52,100
Oh, no.

2118
01:43:52,100 --> 01:43:52,580
There we go.

2119
01:43:52,580 --> 01:44:04,340
Oh, I thought I had the song that would play in the back.

2120
01:44:07,060 --> 01:44:09,220
Oh, here we go from the top.

2121
01:44:12,980 --> 01:44:13,540
There we go.

2122
01:44:19,540 --> 01:44:20,580
All right.

2123
01:44:20,580 --> 01:44:22,260
Obviously, you all know the game at this point.

2124
01:44:23,300 --> 01:44:26,100
All right, so the game is Clay Fighter,

2125
01:44:26,100 --> 01:44:31,780
which came out for the Super Nintendo on November 15, 1993.

2126
01:44:32,740 --> 01:44:37,300
For PAL, it was released as Tournament Edition.

2127
01:44:37,300 --> 01:44:38,420
Actually, I take that back.

2128
01:44:38,420 --> 01:44:40,740
For PAL, it was released on May 26, 1994.

2129
01:44:40,740 --> 01:44:43,540
Then there were other ones like the Tournament Edition

2130
01:44:44,100 --> 01:44:47,620
on May 15, 1994 in North America.

2131
01:44:47,620 --> 01:44:50,660
Genesis got theirs June 23, 1994.

2132
01:44:50,660 --> 01:44:54,020
The PAL region January 1, 1995.

2133
01:44:54,020 --> 01:44:57,220
And Virtual Console in Europe February 6,

2134
01:44:57,220 --> 01:45:01,860
2009 in North America May 25, 2009.

2135
01:45:01,860 --> 01:45:04,820
So every version of it is over 10 years old.

2136
01:45:06,180 --> 01:45:08,500
So it qualifies a bunch.

2137
01:45:10,100 --> 01:45:13,140
At any rate, Clay Fighter is a fighting game.

2138
01:45:13,300 --> 01:45:13,800
Duh.

2139
01:45:15,380 --> 01:45:20,260
That is a parody of Street Fighter and other fighting games.

2140
01:45:21,860 --> 01:45:24,980
And it features like this circus theme

2141
01:45:24,980 --> 01:45:28,580
and has like a claymation type graphics

2142
01:45:29,620 --> 01:45:32,340
that were actually created with, you know,

2143
01:45:32,340 --> 01:45:34,740
photography and digitalizing the clay models

2144
01:45:34,740 --> 01:45:38,820
like something more Mortal Kombat-ish, but with clay models.

2145
01:45:38,820 --> 01:45:47,700
The company Visual Concepts actually had another

2146
01:45:47,700 --> 01:45:50,660
in their sort of clay themed franchises

2147
01:45:50,660 --> 01:45:54,100
that were actually made by Interplay Productions.

2148
01:45:54,100 --> 01:45:57,300
And one was called Claymates, which was a platformer.

2149
01:45:58,980 --> 01:46:02,020
There were even toys.

2150
01:46:02,020 --> 01:46:03,140
I don't know if they ever came out,

2151
01:46:03,140 --> 01:46:07,460
but in July 2020, Megalopolis toys were partnered

2152
01:46:07,460 --> 01:46:11,780
with Interplay to release a line of six injection figures

2153
01:46:11,780 --> 01:46:13,940
based on the game, which is very interesting.

2154
01:46:15,300 --> 01:46:16,740
Anyway, the plot is stupid.

2155
01:46:17,380 --> 01:46:18,660
A meteor?

2156
01:46:18,660 --> 01:46:19,160
What?

2157
01:46:20,020 --> 01:46:21,540
The plot is stupid.

2158
01:46:21,540 --> 01:46:22,020
It's great.

2159
01:46:22,020 --> 01:46:22,580
It's great.

2160
01:46:22,580 --> 01:46:23,940
Well, no, it is.

2161
01:46:23,940 --> 01:46:24,440
It is.

2162
01:46:25,540 --> 01:46:28,900
It's like a meteor made out of clay lands

2163
01:46:28,900 --> 01:46:32,100
on like a little circus.

2164
01:46:32,100 --> 01:46:33,940
And then all the goo from all of this

2165
01:46:33,940 --> 01:46:36,500
contaminates all the circus's attractions

2166
01:46:36,500 --> 01:46:38,900
and makes them bizarre caricatures

2167
01:46:38,900 --> 01:46:41,300
of what they were before, but with superpowers.

2168
01:46:42,180 --> 01:46:47,540
So I love like the characters in this are their names are fun.

2169
01:46:47,540 --> 01:46:51,860
My favorite being bad Mr. Frosty, who's a snowman.

2170
01:46:52,580 --> 01:46:54,980
And he has a very, very, very bad attitude.

2171
01:46:56,180 --> 01:46:58,340
His attacks like are throwing snowballs

2172
01:46:58,340 --> 01:47:02,900
and spitting sharp ice balls and sliding around.

2173
01:47:03,860 --> 01:47:06,820
But I like his taunt because he says, I'm bad.

2174
01:47:06,820 --> 01:47:07,540
I'm cool.

2175
01:47:07,540 --> 01:47:08,500
I'm no one's fool.

2176
01:47:09,860 --> 01:47:11,220
I always remembered that like that.

2177
01:47:11,220 --> 01:47:14,820
Mr. Frosty is like like my guy.

2178
01:47:18,020 --> 01:47:22,260
But there's also blob that's just like that was your guy.

2179
01:47:22,820 --> 01:47:26,020
He was the master of Gujitsu and he can morph

2180
01:47:26,020 --> 01:47:27,140
into different objects.

2181
01:47:27,620 --> 01:47:29,380
And there was another one that I liked,

2182
01:47:29,380 --> 01:47:32,500
which was blue suede goo, which is an Elvis impersonator.

2183
01:47:34,100 --> 01:47:39,620
And he has he fights on the keys of a piano

2184
01:47:39,620 --> 01:47:43,780
that says big hunk of burning clay as in hunk hunk of burning

2185
01:47:43,780 --> 01:47:44,280
love.

2186
01:47:44,900 --> 01:47:48,900
And of course, his name's a parody of blue suede shoes

2187
01:47:48,900 --> 01:47:50,260
from the 1950s.

2188
01:47:51,140 --> 01:47:53,300
Bonker is a clown, so I never played him.

2189
01:47:53,940 --> 01:47:55,940
Bonker is a clown, so I never played him.

2190
01:47:57,860 --> 01:48:01,940
He has like pies and cartwheels and a spring flower

2191
01:48:01,940 --> 01:48:02,900
and a huge hammer.

2192
01:48:03,780 --> 01:48:07,220
And he's got like two fun houses.

2193
01:48:07,220 --> 01:48:08,580
One's a clown head and the other's

2194
01:48:08,580 --> 01:48:09,940
like a giant rubber ducky.

2195
01:48:12,180 --> 01:48:14,340
And then there's Helga, who is my other one,

2196
01:48:14,340 --> 01:48:17,460
who is basically the proverbial fat lady that

2197
01:48:17,460 --> 01:48:18,820
sings at the end of the opera.

2198
01:48:19,780 --> 01:48:22,420
You know, totally wearing like the Viking attire.

2199
01:48:23,860 --> 01:48:26,900
And she's actually the rival of blue suede goo.

2200
01:48:28,260 --> 01:48:29,540
And my main for the record.

2201
01:48:30,900 --> 01:48:34,100
My main for the record, because I always played women

2202
01:48:34,100 --> 01:48:34,820
in fighting games.

2203
01:48:34,820 --> 01:48:35,320
Always.

2204
01:48:35,940 --> 01:48:39,140
Well, she would like launch herself like with her full head

2205
01:48:40,260 --> 01:48:42,340
and like because she had the horns on her head

2206
01:48:42,340 --> 01:48:45,780
and then she would also do like the sonic scream,

2207
01:48:45,780 --> 01:48:47,780
you know, the operatic thing.

2208
01:48:48,580 --> 01:48:53,140
And she's actually the first opponent in single player mode

2209
01:48:53,140 --> 01:48:54,580
and she has like an opera theater.

2210
01:48:55,220 --> 01:48:57,860
Then there's Ichibod Clay, who we're actually

2211
01:48:57,860 --> 01:49:01,540
seeing on the video fighting against the next one, Taffy.

2212
01:49:01,540 --> 01:49:04,740
But Ichibod Clay is a scarecrow with a pumpkin head

2213
01:49:04,740 --> 01:49:07,220
who can teleport and throw ectoplasm.

2214
01:49:08,020 --> 01:49:12,660
The next one is Taffy, who is a gooey.

2215
01:49:13,300 --> 01:49:14,420
He's basically Gumby.

2216
01:49:14,980 --> 01:49:17,060
Yeah, I don't know.

2217
01:49:17,700 --> 01:49:20,340
I think he's like, he looks more like a tapeworm to me.

2218
01:49:20,340 --> 01:49:23,620
But anyway, he can twist himself up and spin

2219
01:49:23,620 --> 01:49:25,140
and flail his arms.

2220
01:49:25,140 --> 01:49:27,620
And in one player mode, he actually,

2221
01:49:28,580 --> 01:49:32,180
his levels are like two different Taffy factories.

2222
01:49:32,180 --> 01:49:35,540
And then there's Tiny, which is a buff,

2223
01:49:35,540 --> 01:49:39,300
very toothy wrestler character who poses.

2224
01:49:39,940 --> 01:49:41,540
But he doesn't actually use wrestling moves.

2225
01:49:41,540 --> 01:49:42,580
He just punches.

2226
01:49:42,580 --> 01:49:44,820
He charges and punches and rolls into a ball

2227
01:49:44,820 --> 01:49:46,580
and throws himself at people.

2228
01:49:48,740 --> 01:49:52,100
And then the final boss is called End Boss,

2229
01:49:52,100 --> 01:49:58,260
End Period Boss, that looks like a ring of balls

2230
01:49:59,300 --> 01:50:01,220
or maybe like a weird necklace.

2231
01:50:02,020 --> 01:50:06,420
And it has round eyes, one open, one half closed.

2232
01:50:07,060 --> 01:50:08,740
And it attacks with projectiles that

2233
01:50:08,740 --> 01:50:11,220
are copied from other characters in a grab attack.

2234
01:50:11,460 --> 01:50:13,380
He does not appear to be made of clay

2235
01:50:13,380 --> 01:50:16,900
and the announcer does not enter, announce his name

2236
01:50:17,620 --> 01:50:22,100
at the start or when he wins, which is like,

2237
01:50:22,100 --> 01:50:23,860
he's just put in there so that someone,

2238
01:50:23,860 --> 01:50:25,460
they have a boss, I guess.

2239
01:50:27,540 --> 01:50:30,180
And he uses the purple meteor as his arena,

2240
01:50:31,060 --> 01:50:33,300
which is actually a palette swap of a blob stage.

2241
01:50:34,260 --> 01:50:36,260
Although in Clay Fighter Tournament Edition,

2242
01:50:36,260 --> 01:50:37,940
he has his own arena.

2243
01:50:38,900 --> 01:50:44,500
His name is actually based on M. Bison and End Boss.

2244
01:50:45,380 --> 01:50:47,300
So End Boss, yay.

2245
01:50:48,580 --> 01:50:52,020
Anyway, the development, there's actually a really good,

2246
01:50:52,020 --> 01:50:54,980
I think it's on Gaming Historian or one of those ones.

2247
01:50:54,980 --> 01:50:56,100
Oh yeah, that's End Boss.

2248
01:50:58,260 --> 01:51:00,260
I fast forwarded the clip since you were talking about it.

2249
01:51:00,260 --> 01:51:00,760
Okay.

2250
01:51:01,620 --> 01:51:04,900
But just talking about the game's development.

2251
01:51:04,900 --> 01:51:08,340
So basically it was developed by Visual Concepts

2252
01:51:08,340 --> 01:51:09,460
and published by Interplay.

2253
01:51:10,340 --> 01:51:15,700
The president, Greg Thomas, said that they really just

2254
01:51:15,700 --> 01:51:19,140
wanted something new and funny, you know,

2255
01:51:19,140 --> 01:51:22,260
an alternative to all the violent fighting stuff.

2256
01:51:22,820 --> 01:51:27,700
And so they looked to different animation experts,

2257
01:51:27,700 --> 01:51:31,700
Ken Pontak, David Blyman of Danger Productions

2258
01:51:31,700 --> 01:51:32,900
in Brisbane, California.

2259
01:51:33,540 --> 01:51:37,060
And then they spent a year developing Clay Fighter.

2260
01:51:38,180 --> 01:51:40,740
Once they had it, had the character's design,

2261
01:51:40,740 --> 01:51:43,700
they molded the characters using different types of clay.

2262
01:51:45,940 --> 01:51:49,860
Like Taffy was created with a stronger type than Blob.

2263
01:51:49,860 --> 01:51:52,820
And they had all kinds of different models and everything.

2264
01:51:52,820 --> 01:51:55,460
And then they animated them using stop motion animation.

2265
01:51:56,340 --> 01:52:01,060
So basically it was a video camera linked to an Amiga computer

2266
01:52:01,780 --> 01:52:06,020
that had a graphics editor that digitized the figures.

2267
01:52:06,740 --> 01:52:12,260
And then they were saying that, you know,

2268
01:52:12,820 --> 01:52:19,380
this part was like a big portion of the development

2269
01:52:19,380 --> 01:52:22,660
to make it scriptable, you know,

2270
01:52:22,660 --> 01:52:24,580
to use the scripting language for the animation

2271
01:52:24,580 --> 01:52:26,500
and to digitize everything.

2272
01:52:26,500 --> 01:52:27,780
It was very long and tedious.

2273
01:52:28,420 --> 01:52:31,540
And Interplay added in a lot with Project

2274
01:52:31,540 --> 01:52:33,780
by creating new character moves

2275
01:52:33,780 --> 01:52:36,180
with different spliced animation sequences.

2276
01:52:37,620 --> 01:52:40,260
They also recorded the musical score,

2277
01:52:40,260 --> 01:52:41,620
the voices, the sound effects.

2278
01:52:42,660 --> 01:52:45,780
And they said the design was originally supposed to compete

2279
01:52:45,780 --> 01:52:47,940
with Mortal Kombat without the heavy violence.

2280
01:52:49,780 --> 01:52:56,420
But Interplay pushed the game saying that parents,

2281
01:52:57,140 --> 01:52:58,020
this is a quote here,

2282
01:52:58,020 --> 01:52:59,780
parents who object to blood and guts games

2283
01:52:59,780 --> 01:53:01,540
now have an alternative title

2284
01:53:01,540 --> 01:53:04,100
that gives kids the kind of intense action

2285
01:53:04,100 --> 01:53:06,500
they want to see in fighting games to make more sales.

2286
01:53:07,300 --> 01:53:11,460
So in 94, we got Clay Fighter Tournament Edition

2287
01:53:12,180 --> 01:53:13,780
that was exclusive.

2288
01:53:13,780 --> 01:53:17,540
It was originally a rental, excuse me,

2289
01:53:17,540 --> 01:53:18,580
through Blockbuster Video.

2290
01:53:19,460 --> 01:53:20,900
And it improved on Clay Fighter.

2291
01:53:20,900 --> 01:53:23,220
It fixed glitches, added different backgrounds,

2292
01:53:23,220 --> 01:53:25,460
offered difficulty setting speeds versus mode.

2293
01:53:27,220 --> 01:53:29,620
And then of course, when the Genesis version came out,

2294
01:53:29,620 --> 01:53:31,780
which did not look nearly as good as the SNES ones,

2295
01:53:33,060 --> 01:53:34,500
that's the version that actually made it

2296
01:53:34,500 --> 01:53:36,100
on the Wii Virtual Console.

2297
01:53:38,180 --> 01:53:41,780
There is a port of Clay Fighter for the Atari Jaguar

2298
01:53:41,780 --> 01:53:43,860
that was in the works, but never released.

2299
01:53:44,980 --> 01:53:46,500
So there were sequels,

2300
01:53:46,500 --> 01:53:50,020
and I might even jump in and do one of these sequels later,

2301
01:53:50,020 --> 01:53:51,220
but I'll give a brief rundown.

2302
01:53:52,340 --> 01:53:55,460
The sequels were Clay Fighter II Judgment Clay,

2303
01:53:55,540 --> 01:53:56,820
as in like Terminator 2.

2304
01:53:58,420 --> 01:54:01,540
That was on SNES in 1995,

2305
01:54:01,540 --> 01:54:05,540
and then Clay Fighter 63 1 3 for the Nintendo 64.

2306
01:54:06,180 --> 01:54:07,700
And then it had a special edition

2307
01:54:07,700 --> 01:54:10,980
called Clay Fighter Sculptor's Cut in 98,

2308
01:54:10,980 --> 01:54:13,620
which was also only available as a rental

2309
01:54:13,620 --> 01:54:16,100
at Blockbuster Video in North America.

2310
01:54:16,100 --> 01:54:19,700
It had, it included four additional characters,

2311
01:54:19,700 --> 01:54:23,140
High Five, Lady Liberty, Lockjaw A Pooch,

2312
01:54:23,140 --> 01:54:24,740
and Zappa Yow Yow Boys.

2313
01:54:26,420 --> 01:54:29,060
They were actually cut out of the original release

2314
01:54:29,060 --> 01:54:30,500
for 63 1 3.

2315
01:54:32,660 --> 01:54:34,820
And, you know, they changed some stuff up to it,

2316
01:54:34,820 --> 01:54:37,940
but Sculptor's Cut is actually considered

2317
01:54:37,940 --> 01:54:39,540
to be one of the rarest games released

2318
01:54:39,540 --> 01:54:41,780
for the Nintendo 64.

2319
01:54:41,780 --> 01:54:45,380
There were only 20,000 copies ever produced.

2320
01:54:46,500 --> 01:54:48,980
In September 2009, Interplay announced

2321
01:54:48,980 --> 01:54:51,620
a return of Clay Fighter for WiiWare in DSi,

2322
01:54:51,620 --> 01:54:54,420
but then they were canceled, sorry, DSiWare.

2323
01:54:55,300 --> 01:54:59,060
March 2015, Interplay revealed a remastered Clay Fighter

2324
01:54:59,060 --> 01:55:01,060
was to be released in 2016,

2325
01:55:01,860 --> 01:55:04,100
and had a partnership with Drip Drop Games.

2326
01:55:04,100 --> 01:55:06,740
It was gonna have more than 20 characters

2327
01:55:06,740 --> 01:55:09,540
and 20 familiar environments,

2328
01:55:09,540 --> 01:55:12,980
Clay-alities, new mechanics like double jumping,

2329
01:55:12,980 --> 01:55:14,740
air dashing, counters, and reversals.

2330
01:55:14,740 --> 01:55:17,220
The game has been canceled and Interplay sold

2331
01:55:17,220 --> 01:55:19,780
the intellectual rights of Clay Fighter

2332
01:55:19,780 --> 01:55:21,140
and many of their titles.

2333
01:55:21,140 --> 01:55:22,660
I don't think it says to whom.

2334
01:55:23,620 --> 01:55:25,940
Anyway, Clay Fighter was awarded

2335
01:55:25,940 --> 01:55:29,460
the Best Street Fighter Wannabe of 1993 by EGM,

2336
01:55:29,460 --> 01:55:30,900
Electronic Games Monthly,

2337
01:55:30,900 --> 01:55:33,060
and was awarded the best sound effects,

2338
01:55:33,060 --> 01:55:34,660
and also for having the best ad.

2339
01:55:36,660 --> 01:55:40,180
It sold 200,000 copies by the end of 94.

2340
01:55:40,820 --> 01:55:43,700
Game Pro said that the Genesis port was pretty positive,

2341
01:55:45,700 --> 01:55:49,060
but I think they were also saying

2342
01:55:49,060 --> 01:55:51,060
that it just wasn't, it looked as good,

2343
01:55:51,060 --> 01:55:55,060
although they thought that the six button Genesis controller

2344
01:55:55,060 --> 01:55:58,180
made it the ideal version to play it on, you know?

2345
01:55:59,460 --> 01:56:05,860
But at any rate, if we're gonna go into the rankings on things,

2346
01:56:05,860 --> 01:56:11,460
I mean, it got kind of middle to positive reviews.

2347
01:56:12,500 --> 01:56:14,900
Nintendo Power gave it a 15 out of 20.

2348
01:56:17,460 --> 01:56:20,020
Video games and computer entertainment gave it 8 out of 10.

2349
01:56:20,020 --> 01:56:21,860
Eurogamer gave it a 5 out of 10.

2350
01:56:21,860 --> 01:56:25,540
EGM for SNES gave it a 30 of 40,

2351
01:56:25,540 --> 01:56:27,860
and then Mega Drive a 6.6 out of 10.

2352
01:56:27,860 --> 01:56:33,380
So yeah, it was, I mean, I'm gonna go on record saying,

2353
01:56:33,380 --> 01:56:35,460
this is not the best fighting game.

2354
01:56:35,460 --> 01:56:37,860
It really isn't, but it's fun.

2355
01:56:38,420 --> 01:56:39,060
Yeah.

2356
01:56:39,060 --> 01:56:40,660
And it's a lot of fun.

2357
01:56:40,660 --> 01:56:44,260
The technology was really clever for its time too.

2358
01:56:44,260 --> 01:56:46,500
You know, the whole concept of, you know,

2359
01:56:46,500 --> 01:56:49,300
instead of capturing live actors like a Mortal Kombat,

2360
01:56:49,380 --> 01:56:53,300
capturing claymation, I think was just a really fun idea.

2361
01:56:53,300 --> 01:56:55,540
This game, you know, the fun that they were trying to do

2362
01:56:55,540 --> 01:56:56,820
with this game really comes through,

2363
01:56:56,820 --> 01:56:59,220
even if mechanically it's less fun.

2364
01:57:00,260 --> 01:57:00,660
Yeah.

2365
01:57:00,660 --> 01:57:04,500
And honestly, like, I totally wish that we would have

2366
01:57:04,500 --> 01:57:06,180
another Clay Fighter game come out.

2367
01:57:06,820 --> 01:57:09,780
Like, I would be so down for that,

2368
01:57:09,780 --> 01:57:11,780
especially with our technology now.

2369
01:57:11,780 --> 01:57:12,580
I don't disagree.

2370
01:57:13,380 --> 01:57:18,900
Like, I mean, they could do the whole thing CG, you know?

2371
01:57:20,260 --> 01:57:22,500
But, you know, have like really good clay

2372
01:57:24,180 --> 01:57:25,540
textures applied to it.

2373
01:57:25,540 --> 01:57:26,040
Yeah.

2374
01:57:26,500 --> 01:57:30,020
I mean, it would, if you were gonna do like

2375
01:57:30,020 --> 01:57:33,620
a stop motion animation character game right now,

2376
01:57:34,740 --> 01:57:38,260
to have it work for our modern sets,

2377
01:57:39,220 --> 01:57:44,660
you would have to do so many in-betweens, right?

2378
01:57:44,660 --> 01:57:45,300
Sure.

2379
01:57:45,300 --> 01:57:49,380
To have it fit like a 60 FPS frame rate, for example.

2380
01:57:50,340 --> 01:57:55,220
So that would mean, like, for every second of motion,

2381
01:57:55,220 --> 01:57:58,980
you would have 60 different animated frames.

2382
01:58:00,020 --> 01:58:02,980
And I'll do that by however much.

2383
01:58:02,980 --> 01:58:03,480
Yeah.

2384
01:58:04,740 --> 01:58:08,500
But yeah, and I think it's time to bring back

2385
01:58:08,500 --> 01:58:10,740
these characters and give them love.

2386
01:58:11,940 --> 01:58:14,260
I want to know who has the license now, though.

2387
01:58:14,340 --> 01:58:15,940
I'd have to look it up and I'm too lazy.

2388
01:58:16,500 --> 01:58:18,180
So yeah, Clay Fighter.

2389
01:58:18,900 --> 01:58:19,400
All right.

2390
01:58:20,580 --> 01:58:21,540
Clay Fighter.

2391
01:58:21,540 --> 01:58:22,500
Clay, Clay Fighter.

2392
01:58:22,500 --> 01:58:22,820
Good.

2393
01:58:22,820 --> 01:58:23,620
I just always liked it.

2394
01:58:23,620 --> 01:58:25,220
Like, it felt like the music would stop

2395
01:58:25,220 --> 01:58:28,820
and then the singer would go and then keep going.

2396
01:58:28,820 --> 01:58:31,780
If nothing else, we just need a bitchin' new theme song

2397
01:58:31,780 --> 01:58:32,500
from the team.

2398
01:58:32,500 --> 01:58:33,220
That's what we need.

2399
01:58:33,860 --> 01:58:36,820
Yeah, but it's still all about that, Mr. Frosty.

2400
01:58:36,820 --> 01:58:37,460
All right.

2401
01:58:37,460 --> 01:58:40,020
Classic game of the week, Clay Fighter.

2402
01:58:40,020 --> 01:58:40,900
Good pick.

2403
01:58:40,900 --> 01:58:41,400
All right.

2404
01:58:42,100 --> 01:58:43,780
We're about two hours in and I know we have

2405
01:58:43,780 --> 01:58:45,300
some long emails tonight, so I want to make sure

2406
01:58:45,300 --> 01:58:46,100
we get to those.

2407
01:58:46,100 --> 01:58:46,740
We do?

2408
01:58:46,740 --> 01:58:48,740
Yeah, we have two that I saw.

2409
01:58:48,740 --> 01:58:52,500
So before we get there, we will get through the rest

2410
01:58:52,500 --> 01:58:52,900
of the news.

2411
01:58:52,900 --> 01:58:54,420
So let's just keep it moving.

2412
01:58:54,420 --> 01:58:56,740
We're going to go to rapid fire news and rapidly talk

2413
01:58:56,740 --> 01:58:57,300
about some news.

2414
01:58:57,300 --> 01:58:57,800
Loki.

2415
01:58:58,340 --> 01:58:58,660
Yes.

2416
01:58:58,660 --> 01:59:02,100
So this is cool if you're looking to get into some VR,

2417
01:59:02,100 --> 01:59:03,620
but don't want to spend as much money.

2418
01:59:04,260 --> 01:59:07,300
The meta quest is dropping in price, or at least

2419
01:59:07,300 --> 01:59:08,340
the meta quest two.

2420
01:59:08,340 --> 01:59:12,180
So they've confirmed that they're dropping the 256 gigabyte

2421
01:59:12,180 --> 01:59:16,820
model down from $499 to $429.

2422
01:59:16,820 --> 01:59:19,140
And I think that's supposed to be a permanent price drop.

2423
01:59:19,140 --> 01:59:23,220
Also, the Quest Pro, which was super expensive for what

2424
01:59:23,220 --> 01:59:27,700
you got, $1,500 is now dropping down to only $1,000.

2425
01:59:28,420 --> 01:59:30,260
So something.

2426
01:59:30,260 --> 01:59:31,780
And that took effect today.

2427
01:59:32,660 --> 01:59:35,700
So if you're in the United States or Canada, you can enjoy

2428
01:59:35,700 --> 01:59:38,340
those lower prices or just wait for them to announce the

2429
01:59:38,340 --> 01:59:39,780
quest three, because that's probably why they dropped

2430
01:59:39,780 --> 01:59:40,740
the price in the first place.

2431
01:59:42,180 --> 01:59:45,940
Speaking of lower prices for consoles, if you are a Verizon

2432
01:59:45,940 --> 01:59:51,300
customer, you have until April 30th to pick up an Xbox Series

2433
01:59:51,300 --> 01:59:53,300
S for only $150.

2434
01:59:54,180 --> 01:59:55,940
It's half off its retail price.

2435
01:59:55,940 --> 02:00:00,100
If you're a Verizon customer, I am.

2436
02:00:00,100 --> 02:00:03,460
But I already have a Series X, so that's no good for me.

2437
02:00:03,460 --> 02:00:05,700
Still a Series S together with Game Pass.

2438
02:00:05,700 --> 02:00:08,180
Pretty good way to get your foot in the door with current

2439
02:00:08,180 --> 02:00:08,680
gaming.

2440
02:00:09,220 --> 02:00:09,720
For sure.

2441
02:00:10,680 --> 02:00:12,440
Dark Zagre, you have a quick story for us.

2442
02:00:14,120 --> 02:00:14,620
I do.

2443
02:00:15,240 --> 02:00:19,480
And actually, I've watched a lot of gameplay because Jack

2444
02:00:19,480 --> 02:00:24,440
Danger has one of these or had one of these on his Twitch

2445
02:00:24,440 --> 02:00:26,440
channel, because of course he does.

2446
02:00:27,720 --> 02:00:28,920
Foo Fighters Pinball.

2447
02:00:29,880 --> 02:00:32,840
And Dan and I were talking about this while we were watching

2448
02:00:32,840 --> 02:00:37,080
you play it, that, oh, it's kind of weird.

2449
02:00:37,080 --> 02:00:38,040
It's kind of niche.

2450
02:00:38,040 --> 02:00:41,080
But then we saw it in play, and it looks really freaking

2451
02:00:41,080 --> 02:00:41,580
fun.

2452
02:00:43,080 --> 02:00:45,880
They, Stern did release a trailer about it.

2453
02:00:45,880 --> 02:00:49,480
They didn't actually show anything of the actual game, but

2454
02:00:49,480 --> 02:00:54,840
it has different custom drawn animation, including like

2455
02:00:54,840 --> 02:00:55,340
this.

2456
02:00:56,760 --> 02:00:59,800
The article describes it as a Ghostbusters cartoon vibe.

2457
02:00:59,800 --> 02:01:05,080
I think of it almost more a little bit like a combination

2458
02:01:05,080 --> 02:01:06,760
of Scooby Doo and Ghostbusters.

2459
02:01:08,680 --> 02:01:09,720
Yep, exactly.

2460
02:01:09,720 --> 02:01:12,760
As Bobby said it, he was the designer of the game.

2461
02:01:14,120 --> 02:01:16,680
But I mean, it's really fun.

2462
02:01:16,680 --> 02:01:21,560
And of course, it's got their music in the game.

2463
02:01:22,440 --> 02:01:24,600
And everybody.

2464
02:01:24,600 --> 02:01:28,280
So right now it has, of course, Dave Grohl, Chris Shifflett

2465
02:01:28,280 --> 02:01:32,840
and Pat Smear, Nate Mendel, Rami Jaffee, and their late

2466
02:01:32,840 --> 02:01:40,440
drummer Taylor Hawkins are all in the movies in the game.

2467
02:01:40,440 --> 02:01:43,560
I'm glad they were able to get Taylor in the game after all.

2468
02:01:43,560 --> 02:01:44,060
Yeah.

2469
02:01:45,720 --> 02:01:48,200
But it's just a trip.

2470
02:01:48,200 --> 02:01:53,080
I mean, it really is like just it looks like super, super

2471
02:01:53,080 --> 02:01:53,580
fun.

2472
02:01:54,520 --> 02:01:57,800
SSJ100 Matt says all the Gen X fans are becoming tables,

2473
02:01:57,800 --> 02:01:59,240
and I don't hate it, right?

2474
02:01:59,240 --> 02:02:01,160
Where's my nine inch nails pinball table?

2475
02:02:03,160 --> 02:02:03,880
I love that.

2476
02:02:05,400 --> 02:02:07,880
I mean, I'll be honest.

2477
02:02:07,880 --> 02:02:11,240
I would want this over some of the ones that we have.

2478
02:02:12,360 --> 02:02:14,760
I'm pretty sure we will never have a Depeche Mode pinball.

2479
02:02:14,760 --> 02:02:16,360
I'm just going to say that right now.

2480
02:02:16,360 --> 02:02:19,080
We would have nine inch nails before we had Cure in Depeche Mode.

2481
02:02:21,080 --> 02:02:21,640
I don't know.

2482
02:02:22,360 --> 02:02:24,280
A Cure pinball table would be kind of.

2483
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:27,800
I don't think Robert Smith would go for that.

2484
02:02:28,520 --> 02:02:29,080
You never know.

2485
02:02:29,480 --> 02:02:32,760
But I'm very sure Depeche Mode would not.

2486
02:02:34,280 --> 02:02:34,780
Probably not.

2487
02:02:35,320 --> 02:02:39,560
Yeah, but at any rate, at any rate, though, it just looks like so much fun.

2488
02:02:39,560 --> 02:02:40,920
I love the art style.

2489
02:02:41,480 --> 02:02:42,520
So, yeah.

2490
02:02:42,520 --> 02:02:43,020
Yeah.

2491
02:02:44,600 --> 02:02:46,840
What's Jack Danger's pinball channel again?

2492
02:02:46,840 --> 02:02:48,040
I just know it's him.

2493
02:02:51,320 --> 02:02:53,560
But if you dead flip, that's it.

2494
02:02:53,560 --> 02:02:54,060
Dead flip.

2495
02:02:54,860 --> 02:02:59,260
If you go back, like, I think it was either yesterday or the day before,

2496
02:02:59,260 --> 02:03:04,940
but go back on Dead Flip's Twitch and you can see some footage of the game.

2497
02:03:07,100 --> 02:03:07,340
All right.

2498
02:03:07,340 --> 02:03:12,380
Well, real quick, I'm just going to mention that Splatoon 3 got a 3.0 update.

2499
02:03:12,380 --> 02:03:18,460
It just launched this past week, and most of it is to support the additional DLC that's incoming,

2500
02:03:18,460 --> 02:03:24,300
the Inkopolis DLC, which again, still makes no sense to me why this is an interesting thing at

2501
02:03:24,300 --> 02:03:28,540
all, but it's there and allows you to travel between the old town and the new town.

2502
02:03:28,540 --> 02:03:29,020
Cool.

2503
02:03:29,020 --> 02:03:31,900
I guess it's all the same shit.

2504
02:03:31,900 --> 02:03:33,980
It's weird, but okay.

2505
02:03:33,980 --> 02:03:36,620
But there were other things that they're being added.

2506
02:03:36,620 --> 02:03:43,340
Things about fresh season 2023 with a new catalog, new gear, a new gear brand, 126 new items,

2507
02:03:43,340 --> 02:03:45,740
two new battle stages, two new special weapons.

2508
02:03:45,740 --> 02:03:46,780
You get where I'm going with this.

2509
02:03:46,780 --> 02:03:51,500
There is a lot of other new stuff that's being launched with the fresh season 2023 that's coming

2510
02:03:51,500 --> 02:03:52,140
as well.

2511
02:03:52,140 --> 02:03:53,740
It gets really into the weeds.

2512
02:03:53,740 --> 02:03:57,980
I don't have time during rapid fire to talk about some of these intricate changes to

2513
02:03:57,980 --> 02:04:02,860
multiplayers, like what are some of the special weapons they have and some of the new weapons

2514
02:04:02,860 --> 02:04:03,980
coming into shops.

2515
02:04:03,980 --> 02:04:08,620
But for folks that are playing the game, I'm sure there's a lot of cool stuff here.

2516
02:04:08,620 --> 02:04:13,020
I noticed this interesting note, changes to connectivity made it so that players will

2517
02:04:13,020 --> 02:04:14,940
be notified when their connection is unstable.

2518
02:04:14,940 --> 02:04:19,580
If the connection continues to be unstable, player controls will temporarily be disabled.

2519
02:04:19,580 --> 02:04:21,100
That's very interesting.

2520
02:04:21,100 --> 02:04:24,540
So yeah, also some Splatfest changes.

2521
02:04:24,540 --> 02:04:31,340
Basically, it looks like they're kind of make a changing Splatfest TXP across the board

2522
02:04:32,140 --> 02:04:36,220
to 7500 each stage as opposed to this incrementing thing.

2523
02:04:36,220 --> 02:04:37,660
So it's kind of interesting.

2524
02:04:37,660 --> 02:04:41,420
So check it out if you're a Splatoon fan and I'm still with that.

2525
02:04:42,140 --> 02:04:45,740
That all being said, let's travel around the world and check out some games you can check

2526
02:04:45,740 --> 02:04:48,460
out this week as they release starting with the US.

2527
02:04:48,460 --> 02:04:48,860
Loki.

2528
02:04:49,900 --> 02:04:53,340
Yes, so what a great one to start with.

2529
02:04:53,340 --> 02:05:01,020
We have Romansylvania on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox series.

2530
02:05:02,300 --> 02:05:08,300
Caverns of Mars Recharged on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox

2531
02:05:08,380 --> 02:05:09,900
1, and Xbox series.

2532
02:05:10,780 --> 02:05:17,820
Clash Artifacts of Chaos on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox 1, and Xbox series.

2533
02:05:18,540 --> 02:05:22,140
Fatal Frame Mask of the Lunar Eclipse.

2534
02:05:22,140 --> 02:05:28,700
That's on a PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox 1, and Xbox series.

2535
02:05:30,140 --> 02:05:33,260
Looks like Ib on Nintendo Switch.

2536
02:05:34,060 --> 02:05:39,340
Oni Road to Be the Mightiest Oni on Nintendo Switch.

2537
02:05:41,900 --> 02:05:49,660
Paranormal Sight, The Seven Mysteries of Honjo on Nintendo Switch, iOS, and Android.

2538
02:05:50,780 --> 02:05:57,340
We have Ray's Arcade Chronology on Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4.

2539
02:05:58,140 --> 02:06:01,820
Oh, so that's, I guess, based off the Ray Force series.

2540
02:06:02,780 --> 02:06:12,620
And then looks like Mato Anomalies on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5,

2541
02:06:12,620 --> 02:06:14,780
Xbox 1, and Xbox series.

2542
02:06:14,780 --> 02:06:15,820
And that is it.

2543
02:06:16,540 --> 02:06:19,740
All right, traveling to Japan, it's actually a lot of the same stuff, so I'll try to move

2544
02:06:19,740 --> 02:06:20,460
through this quickly.

2545
02:06:20,460 --> 02:06:26,620
On the Nintendo Switch, we have Ray's Arcade Chronology in a regular and limited edition.

2546
02:06:27,180 --> 02:06:28,540
And I'm trying to see what games are in that.

2547
02:06:28,540 --> 02:06:30,860
Oh, it's Ray Force, Ray Storm, Ray Crisis.

2548
02:06:30,860 --> 02:06:31,900
That's why they call it Ray's.

2549
02:06:33,020 --> 02:06:34,620
This is such a good series.

2550
02:06:34,620 --> 02:06:36,620
Yeah, so that's coming out on the Switch this week.

2551
02:06:37,260 --> 02:06:41,260
And then we also have Melon Journey, Bittersweet Memories, Fatal Frame, Mask of the Lunar

2552
02:06:41,260 --> 02:06:48,700
Eclipse, Record of, excuse me, that's only a US, Ib is also out in Japan this week, as

2553
02:06:48,700 --> 02:06:52,620
well as that Oni Road to Be the Mightiest Oni, that's out in Japan as well.

2554
02:06:53,580 --> 02:06:56,460
And Chef Life, a restaurant simulator.

2555
02:06:57,100 --> 02:06:59,420
Yes, that is out as well in Japan this week.

2556
02:06:59,420 --> 02:07:03,100
Checking out the PlayStation 5, some crossovers as well.

2557
02:07:03,100 --> 02:07:06,780
You still have that Oni Road to Be the Mightiest Oni is out there as well.

2558
02:07:06,780 --> 02:07:11,340
And the Melon Journey, Bittersweet Memories, those are crossing over to the PlayStation

2559
02:07:11,340 --> 02:07:12,460
5 this week.

2560
02:07:12,460 --> 02:07:14,060
But otherwise, that is it.

2561
02:07:14,060 --> 02:07:15,420
How about the UK, Dark Sakura?

2562
02:07:16,780 --> 02:07:18,140
Just a handful of things.

2563
02:07:18,780 --> 02:07:22,380
It looks like we get Train Life, a railway simulator for Switch.

2564
02:07:24,140 --> 02:07:29,900
Also on the ninth, we get for PlayStation and Xbox, Monster Energy Supercross 6.

2565
02:07:30,540 --> 02:07:32,620
For Switch, we get Session Skatesim.

2566
02:07:33,420 --> 02:07:40,460
On the 10th, we get for the big three, we get DC Justice League, Cosmic Chaos.

2567
02:07:41,020 --> 02:07:43,660
PlayStation and Switch, we get My Life Pet Vet.

2568
02:07:44,460 --> 02:07:47,820
Also on the two, we get Crazy Chicken Traps and Treasures.

2569
02:07:49,100 --> 02:07:51,260
On PlayStation, we get Game Deck.

2570
02:07:52,300 --> 02:07:55,820
And then on the big three, we get Mato anomalies.

2571
02:07:57,260 --> 02:07:57,760
All right.

2572
02:07:58,780 --> 02:08:00,700
Let's do some more stories here.

2573
02:08:00,700 --> 02:08:03,980
And I'm going to be honest, I'm starting to get a little tired as we're moving on.

2574
02:08:03,980 --> 02:08:06,780
I think that's just me being exhausted from everything last week.

2575
02:08:06,780 --> 02:08:10,860
So I'm maybe fighting off whatever Alan has probably passed on.

2576
02:08:11,260 --> 02:08:19,420
So let's move through these stories and wrap up the show.

2577
02:08:19,420 --> 02:08:21,740
So let's get to this from Loki.

2578
02:08:22,700 --> 02:08:23,200
Yes.

2579
02:08:23,200 --> 02:08:33,340
So we have a new number one subscribed Twitch star, I guess if you will, Kai Sennett.

2580
02:08:33,340 --> 02:08:43,580
He is a 21-year-old African-American Twitch streamer who has now beat Ludwig as the most

2581
02:08:43,580 --> 02:08:49,660
subscribed Twitch, I guess, streamer.

2582
02:08:49,660 --> 02:08:55,580
And he, I guess what's notable, I guess they said because he did that the last week of

2583
02:08:55,580 --> 02:08:57,740
February is a Black History Month type of thing.

2584
02:08:57,740 --> 02:09:03,100
I guess it's a nice coincidence, but it's cool to see, though, more rising stars kind

2585
02:09:03,100 --> 02:09:04,700
of coming through the whole Twitch scene.

2586
02:09:04,700 --> 02:09:10,380
He streams a lot of, I guess, Fortnite, Grand Theft Auto 5, NBA 2K, 23, and that type of

2587
02:09:10,380 --> 02:09:10,880
stuff.

2588
02:09:11,340 --> 02:09:14,780
Plus that collabs with a lot of different hip hop artists as well.

2589
02:09:16,540 --> 02:09:17,900
Well, congratulations.

2590
02:09:17,900 --> 02:09:18,400
Good.

2591
02:09:18,700 --> 02:09:19,980
All right, DarkSakura.

2592
02:09:19,980 --> 02:09:34,300
So Sega has put out a survey asking for opinions on a certain number of games.

2593
02:09:35,180 --> 02:09:40,620
So the ones that have been on the list, there's actually a few.

2594
02:09:40,620 --> 02:09:49,580
We have Judgment, Golden Axe, Streets of Rage, Shinobi, Crazy Taxi, Jet Set Radio,

2595
02:09:50,860 --> 02:09:54,380
Altered Beast, House of the Dead, and Virtua Fighter.

2596
02:09:54,380 --> 02:09:58,620
And basically it's like, you know, you get three options.

2597
02:09:58,620 --> 02:10:01,740
Never heard of it, heard of it, but never played it or played a game from it.

2598
02:10:03,420 --> 02:10:09,900
So I think that they're trying to garner who knows these IPs and who would be likely to

2599
02:10:09,980 --> 02:10:10,480
play it.

2600
02:10:11,180 --> 02:10:19,580
So, I mean, Bloomberg did report that Sega, this is actually last April, that Sega was

2601
02:10:19,580 --> 02:10:25,020
investing in their back catalog, working on reboots for Crazy Taxi and Jet Set Radio.

2602
02:10:26,380 --> 02:10:27,900
So who knows?

2603
02:10:28,460 --> 02:10:30,940
And of course we have the Samba game got recently announced.

2604
02:10:30,940 --> 02:10:35,420
So this isn't completely, completely, completely a surprise that Sega is dipping back in this

2605
02:10:35,420 --> 02:10:37,900
Dreamcast Classics catalog, but good.

2606
02:10:38,700 --> 02:10:39,980
I want them to bring knights.

2607
02:10:42,220 --> 02:10:43,660
Why do we not have any more knights?

2608
02:10:43,660 --> 02:10:44,380
We need more knights.

2609
02:10:45,020 --> 02:10:46,300
We need to go get on that survey.

2610
02:10:47,420 --> 02:10:48,540
We got Balan Wonderworld.

2611
02:10:48,540 --> 02:10:50,300
I mean, that's basically the same thing, right?

2612
02:10:50,300 --> 02:10:51,100
Stop.

2613
02:10:51,100 --> 02:10:51,600
All right.

2614
02:10:53,260 --> 02:10:53,740
All right.

2615
02:10:53,740 --> 02:10:54,700
Let's move on.

2616
02:10:54,700 --> 02:10:55,200
Loki.

2617
02:10:57,100 --> 02:10:57,600
Okay.

2618
02:10:57,900 --> 02:11:01,180
Well, this is a pretty cool deal as well.

2619
02:11:01,180 --> 02:11:04,860
So there's a brand new Humble Bundle and oh my God, we ever talk about Humble Bundle.

2620
02:11:04,860 --> 02:11:06,380
That hasn't happened in years.

2621
02:11:08,060 --> 02:11:16,780
They have 72 games for 30, or at least as little as $30 as part of a Syria Turkey Relief

2622
02:11:16,780 --> 02:11:17,580
Bundle.

2623
02:11:17,580 --> 02:11:20,140
And there's lots of big games in there as well.

2624
02:11:20,780 --> 02:11:27,740
So we've got such things as like Gotham Knights, Ghostrunner, System Shock 2, XCOM 2,

2625
02:11:27,740 --> 02:11:33,820
Payday 2, Mountain Blade, Warband, lots of different games in there.

2626
02:11:33,820 --> 02:11:39,340
I definitely picked it up because, you know, got to add to my number of games I don't play.

2627
02:11:41,340 --> 02:11:42,380
Too true.

2628
02:11:42,380 --> 02:11:44,700
But Gotham Knights being in this bundle.

2629
02:11:44,700 --> 02:11:47,660
I mean, that game is like not even six months old.

2630
02:11:47,660 --> 02:11:48,380
My goodness.

2631
02:11:48,380 --> 02:11:49,740
No, it's very recent.

2632
02:11:50,460 --> 02:11:53,100
Yeah, lots and lots of things to check out in there.

2633
02:11:53,100 --> 02:11:57,340
Yeah, there's a lot in this, but it looks like they've raised as of right now, two and

2634
02:11:57,340 --> 02:11:58,300
a half million and counting.

2635
02:11:58,860 --> 02:11:59,740
So nice for them.

2636
02:11:59,740 --> 02:12:03,020
All right.

2637
02:12:03,020 --> 02:12:04,700
And one more story for you.

2638
02:12:06,060 --> 02:12:11,420
Who doesn't love the classic game Zero Wing and the earliest earliest of internet memes,

2639
02:12:12,060 --> 02:12:16,780
including Move Every Zig and All Your Base Are Belong to Us, of course.

2640
02:12:17,660 --> 02:12:19,020
This is interesting, though.

2641
02:12:19,020 --> 02:12:26,220
So Topland has, you know, Topland publisher Bitwave.

2642
02:12:26,220 --> 02:12:27,100
Toaplan.

2643
02:12:27,100 --> 02:12:27,900
Toaplan, excuse me.

2644
02:12:27,900 --> 02:12:29,180
I always say Toaplan.

2645
02:12:29,260 --> 02:12:36,220
Toaplan is the publisher Bitwave is going to be doing an update for this collection.

2646
02:12:36,220 --> 02:12:42,940
It has changes and fixes, and they're adding the introduction sequence for the arcade version

2647
02:12:42,940 --> 02:12:47,820
of Zero Wing because it didn't exist in the original version.

2648
02:12:47,820 --> 02:12:50,140
It was in the Mega Drive port.

2649
02:12:50,140 --> 02:12:53,820
There was no introduction in the original coin op edition.

2650
02:12:53,820 --> 02:12:59,980
So now there is a brand new introduction with new hand drawn artwork that is available.

2651
02:12:59,980 --> 02:13:03,260
They're also trying to target some of the other things that have been noticed by hardcore

2652
02:13:03,260 --> 02:13:07,900
fans, you know, basically, you know, some of the little control issues and things of

2653
02:13:07,900 --> 02:13:08,700
that sort.

2654
02:13:08,700 --> 02:13:11,100
I just want to see really quickly if I can bring it up here.

2655
02:13:12,140 --> 02:13:13,100
What this might look like.

2656
02:13:13,100 --> 02:13:19,420
Oh, my gosh, this is it really is pretty similar to what you had before.

2657
02:13:20,060 --> 02:13:25,180
And it's even I'm turning on the music a little bit.

2658
02:13:25,900 --> 02:13:27,660
We are getting a signal on screen.

2659
02:13:29,500 --> 02:13:31,100
Main screen turned on.

2660
02:13:31,100 --> 02:13:35,740
Yeah, it's pretty much what you remember.

2661
02:13:35,740 --> 02:13:38,300
But just with that right.

2662
02:13:38,300 --> 02:13:39,420
How are you gentlemen?

2663
02:13:41,020 --> 02:13:45,100
Is that art style that you would your base are belong to us?

2664
02:13:45,100 --> 02:13:45,500
Perfect.

2665
02:13:45,500 --> 02:13:46,380
We'll end on that note.

2666
02:13:46,380 --> 02:13:54,620
Um, it is what an arcade machine of that era might look like, to be honest.

2667
02:13:56,540 --> 02:13:57,100
It's great.

2668
02:13:58,380 --> 02:14:02,060
I'm glad that they went back and added that just for that effect.

2669
02:14:02,060 --> 02:14:02,780
It's amazing.

2670
02:14:03,500 --> 02:14:07,180
And of course, of course, they kept the line as is, of course they did.

2671
02:14:07,180 --> 02:14:12,140
That would be like, okay, can you imagine they've re translated Final Fantasy four,

2672
02:14:12,140 --> 02:14:15,660
I don't know how many times they are not allowed to get rid of the line.

2673
02:14:15,660 --> 02:14:17,020
You spoonie bard.

2674
02:14:17,020 --> 02:14:17,580
Guess what?

2675
02:14:17,580 --> 02:14:20,620
In Japanese, he did not say you spoonie bard.

2676
02:14:20,620 --> 02:14:23,260
That was a silly translation of that era.

2677
02:14:23,820 --> 02:14:25,980
They did like the equivalent of you son of a bitch.

2678
02:14:26,860 --> 02:14:28,060
Basically, it's you asshole.

2679
02:14:28,060 --> 02:14:29,180
Yeah, you jerk.

2680
02:14:29,180 --> 02:14:33,660
But obviously, to make it family friendly, some liberties were taken by the translator

2681
02:14:33,660 --> 02:14:35,660
and it became you spoonie bard.

2682
02:14:35,660 --> 02:14:40,940
And now your spoonie belongs to us.

2683
02:14:40,940 --> 02:14:41,580
I can't.

2684
02:14:43,900 --> 02:14:45,340
All right, you know what?

2685
02:14:45,420 --> 02:14:46,460
I'm officially done.

2686
02:14:46,460 --> 02:14:47,820
Let's go to the mailbag.

2687
02:14:47,820 --> 02:14:49,500
Every week we invite your emails.

2688
02:14:50,060 --> 02:14:52,940
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

2689
02:14:52,940 --> 02:14:53,580
Who said that?

2690
02:14:53,580 --> 02:14:54,540
I was even looking at chat.

2691
02:14:54,540 --> 02:14:55,420
Who said that?

2692
02:14:55,420 --> 02:14:55,980
Fifth Dream.

2693
02:14:56,780 --> 02:14:57,740
Fifth Dream.

2694
02:14:57,740 --> 02:14:58,460
Gold Star.

2695
02:14:58,460 --> 02:14:59,020
Gold Star.

2696
02:14:59,020 --> 02:15:00,140
All right, wait a second.

2697
02:15:00,140 --> 02:15:04,300
I have to explain something to SSJ100Matt about I am error.

2698
02:15:05,820 --> 02:15:09,180
There was another character who was named Bagu.

2699
02:15:10,380 --> 02:15:10,700
Bug.

2700
02:15:12,060 --> 02:15:13,100
Error and bug.

2701
02:15:15,980 --> 02:15:17,420
Cute.

2702
02:15:17,420 --> 02:15:20,380
The name was not a mistranslation.

2703
02:15:21,900 --> 02:15:30,220
Bagu was more like a direct romanization of how bug would be pronounced, you know, in

2704
02:15:30,220 --> 02:15:31,420
Japanese, I guess.

2705
02:15:32,380 --> 02:15:35,020
So no, they were error and bug.

2706
02:15:35,820 --> 02:15:37,500
Well, how about you know what?

2707
02:15:37,500 --> 02:15:41,180
Why don't we get Bagu an error in a future Zelda game?

2708
02:15:41,180 --> 02:15:42,780
Whatever happened to those two?

2709
02:15:42,780 --> 02:15:43,740
That's what I want to know.

2710
02:15:44,140 --> 02:15:45,740
Maybe we'll find out in Tears of the Kingdom.

2711
02:15:45,740 --> 02:15:46,460
Do you know Bagu?

2712
02:15:48,540 --> 02:15:49,100
I do.

2713
02:15:49,100 --> 02:15:50,380
I do know the Bagu.

2714
02:15:50,380 --> 02:15:52,300
No, he was the bridge guy, wasn't he?

2715
02:15:52,300 --> 02:15:52,800
Yeah.

2716
02:15:54,540 --> 02:15:56,700
I know my classics once in a while.

2717
02:15:57,420 --> 02:15:57,920
Yeah.

2718
02:15:58,860 --> 02:15:59,420
Anywho.

2719
02:15:59,420 --> 02:16:06,060
Especially that one because I actually beat that one as a kid and beating Zelda 2 is one

2720
02:16:06,060 --> 02:16:08,140
of those like Gold Star gamer achievement.

2721
02:16:08,140 --> 02:16:09,180
I actually beat that one.

2722
02:16:09,180 --> 02:16:10,300
It wasn't easy, but I did it.

2723
02:16:10,300 --> 02:16:11,580
Okay, beat the guardian legend.

2724
02:16:13,740 --> 02:16:14,240
I'll try.

2725
02:16:18,700 --> 02:16:19,340
Oh, yeah.

2726
02:16:19,340 --> 02:16:21,900
No, Gwen brought up like my favorite line.

2727
02:16:22,460 --> 02:16:28,060
Sit your ass down in your chair and drink your goddamn tea from Sid.

2728
02:16:28,060 --> 02:16:29,180
This tea is delicious.

2729
02:16:30,860 --> 02:16:33,980
That I have that line perfectly memorized.

2730
02:16:33,980 --> 02:16:34,460
I love it.

2731
02:16:34,460 --> 02:16:35,580
Okay, so email.

2732
02:16:35,580 --> 02:16:38,620
Participate at orangeandrea.com.

2733
02:16:38,620 --> 02:16:39,420
All right.

2734
02:16:39,420 --> 02:16:41,420
First one comes from Ranchan.

2735
02:16:41,420 --> 02:16:43,980
There were some very interesting things that were discussed.

2736
02:16:43,980 --> 02:16:46,540
I'd like to take a few minutes to discuss if you don't mind.

2737
02:16:46,540 --> 02:16:48,140
Number one, working from home.

2738
02:16:48,140 --> 02:16:50,620
I know this is a hotly discussed topic outside of gaming.

2739
02:16:50,620 --> 02:16:54,300
I do remember reading that the team behind Tiny Tina's Wonderlands would have been longer

2740
02:16:54,300 --> 02:16:57,500
if the team wasn't remote, which to me does make sense.

2741
02:16:57,500 --> 02:16:59,740
I do understand that not every job can be remote.

2742
02:16:59,740 --> 02:17:01,420
Mine can be hybrid, but it's on site.

2743
02:17:01,420 --> 02:17:02,860
I like going to work in my office.

2744
02:17:02,860 --> 02:17:08,220
You're required to be on site unless the role you have is coded for remote.

2745
02:17:09,100 --> 02:17:11,820
And if you're on site, you must be fully vaccinated and boosted.

2746
02:17:11,820 --> 02:17:13,100
I will say this, though.

2747
02:17:13,100 --> 02:17:17,580
During the beginning of the pandemic, a famous talent agency required everyone to come into

2748
02:17:17,580 --> 02:17:20,300
the office and they lost a lot of good people.

2749
02:17:20,300 --> 02:17:26,140
Now, the talent agency I worked for moved and everyone moved everyone to laptops and

2750
02:17:26,140 --> 02:17:29,900
sent people home for the majority of the period.

2751
02:17:29,900 --> 02:17:35,340
And now we just expanded one of our floors because oddly enough, more people want to

2752
02:17:35,340 --> 02:17:36,620
come into the office right now.

2753
02:17:36,620 --> 02:17:41,980
We're not at full capacity, but you can see the camaraderie among the associates on the

2754
02:17:41,980 --> 02:17:45,340
floor, something you don't you can't really get when working from home.

2755
02:17:46,780 --> 02:17:47,280
OK.

2756
02:17:49,260 --> 02:17:52,220
Yeah, I mean, some people prefer me.

2757
02:17:52,860 --> 02:18:00,220
My job can be done just as efficiently at the office or at home because of what I do.

2758
02:18:01,420 --> 02:18:05,500
But it does make it hard for something that should be a collaborative effort.

2759
02:18:06,380 --> 02:18:08,140
So, yeah, I mean, I get it.

2760
02:18:09,340 --> 02:18:09,840
Well said.

2761
02:18:11,020 --> 02:18:14,860
It's just the opposite for me, because if I go into the office and they'll see how annoyed

2762
02:18:14,860 --> 02:18:19,020
at the other people I am, it's best that they don't see me in the office.

2763
02:18:20,140 --> 02:18:24,220
I'm just glad that I face inward toward my computer.

2764
02:18:24,220 --> 02:18:27,980
When you face your computer, no one can see you eye roll, although they can hear it.

2765
02:18:27,980 --> 02:18:32,620
My job, I work with offices up and down the state, so I would be kind of like remote.

2766
02:18:32,620 --> 02:18:36,700
My team is up and down the state, too, so I would be kind of remote working anyway.

2767
02:18:36,700 --> 02:18:39,980
So it's an interesting kind of predicament I'm in.

2768
02:18:39,980 --> 02:18:44,220
The interesting change is that I don't and all of us don't travel.

2769
02:18:44,220 --> 02:18:48,300
Like back in the day, I probably would have flown down to Southern California once every

2770
02:18:48,300 --> 02:18:52,540
few months to see the team there and that's off the table.

2771
02:18:52,540 --> 02:18:54,780
So we have to connect on Zoom and do other things.

2772
02:18:54,780 --> 02:19:00,140
But I think a lot of companies are still trying to find their rhythm with all of that.

2773
02:19:00,700 --> 02:19:03,980
What does this, using my quotey fingers, new normal look like?

2774
02:19:03,980 --> 02:19:09,980
Because number one, obviously, COVID and the pandemic, it's still a thing whether society's

2775
02:19:09,980 --> 02:19:10,700
over it or not.

2776
02:19:11,340 --> 02:19:18,140
Whether they declare it endemic status or whatever, the reality is people's perception

2777
02:19:18,140 --> 02:19:23,900
of what work can be and the fact that people know full damn well they can do their jobs

2778
02:19:23,900 --> 02:19:26,940
at home have really changed the game.

2779
02:19:26,940 --> 02:19:30,860
People that are looking for jobs are looking for jobs that they can do remotely.

2780
02:19:30,860 --> 02:19:32,540
It's interesting.

2781
02:19:33,580 --> 02:19:39,740
I will say there's been some good things for going back into the office and the fact

2782
02:19:39,740 --> 02:19:44,140
that it's actually improved my ability to go out and be around people.

2783
02:19:45,660 --> 02:19:50,940
I feel like as I'm adjusting more to being around people, some of my social anxiety has

2784
02:19:50,940 --> 02:19:51,900
certainly decreased.

2785
02:19:52,780 --> 02:19:56,300
But I'm also a, if it fucks me up, face it kind of person.

2786
02:19:57,740 --> 02:20:00,460
And it's been really good because I'm friends.

2787
02:20:01,180 --> 02:20:01,900
I work with Drew.

2788
02:20:06,460 --> 02:20:10,140
My work buddies are like my other family, sort of.

2789
02:20:11,340 --> 02:20:13,020
So I like going in and seeing them.

2790
02:20:13,020 --> 02:20:14,780
I certainly love going to the cafeteria.

2791
02:20:15,740 --> 02:20:23,500
Also, right now, Melody is sort of one of my co-workers, but in the big office.

2792
02:20:24,940 --> 02:20:26,540
So we chat at work.

2793
02:20:29,020 --> 02:20:29,820
So the next part.

2794
02:20:30,780 --> 02:20:32,300
The game that is not mentioned.

2795
02:20:32,300 --> 02:20:32,860
Oh shit.

2796
02:20:33,980 --> 02:20:38,140
Now I know this game has caused a lot of controversy and yes, Rob, the boycotting on this game

2797
02:20:38,140 --> 02:20:39,420
did indeed backfire.

2798
02:20:39,420 --> 02:20:41,180
I have no desire to play this game.

2799
02:20:41,180 --> 02:20:42,460
I know people who do.

2800
02:20:42,460 --> 02:20:46,540
They can separate the art from the artist and that's them, but I will not berate someone

2801
02:20:46,540 --> 02:20:47,500
for playing it.

2802
02:20:47,500 --> 02:20:50,300
That falls under the rule of fuck around and find out.

2803
02:20:50,300 --> 02:20:55,500
I won't go into any further on my thoughts on the game because the three of you said

2804
02:20:55,500 --> 02:20:55,980
it already.

2805
02:20:55,980 --> 02:20:58,380
Y'all said it in a way that I could not, and I thank you for it.

2806
02:20:59,260 --> 02:21:03,820
And as for Jamie going beyond this and talking about how to help and support marginalized

2807
02:21:03,820 --> 02:21:05,820
people, I could give you a great big hug.

2808
02:21:05,820 --> 02:21:07,100
Oh, you make me feel good.

2809
02:21:07,100 --> 02:21:09,260
You are the epitome of ally support for us.

2810
02:21:09,820 --> 02:21:15,180
I honestly feel that those who do not know the struggle should take a page from y'all's

2811
02:21:15,180 --> 02:21:16,140
support book and learn.

2812
02:21:16,140 --> 02:21:20,780
And while we're here, I know that it was discussed how Saudi Arabia's investment in

2813
02:21:20,780 --> 02:21:23,420
Nintendo does not sit well with us.

2814
02:21:23,420 --> 02:21:25,580
The issue that Nintendo doesn't know.

2815
02:21:26,540 --> 02:21:29,820
The issue is that Nintendo doesn't know the issue and does not care.

2816
02:21:29,820 --> 02:21:34,300
For example, there was a Saudi Arabian cosplay contest with a top prize of 10 grand.

2817
02:21:34,300 --> 02:21:38,700
A lot of American cosplayers boycotted it where European, Asian, and other international

2818
02:21:38,700 --> 02:21:40,060
cosplayers entered.

2819
02:21:40,060 --> 02:21:43,900
Their reason was simply what's going on between the US and Saudi Arabia has nothing to do

2820
02:21:43,900 --> 02:21:44,540
with me.

2821
02:21:44,540 --> 02:21:45,740
So much for solidarity.

2822
02:21:47,180 --> 02:21:48,220
And one more thing, Rob.

2823
02:21:48,220 --> 02:21:51,420
I know that you've mentioned on how the show can get political.

2824
02:21:51,420 --> 02:21:51,740
Fuck it.

2825
02:21:51,740 --> 02:21:52,700
Let it be.

2826
02:21:52,700 --> 02:21:56,380
The topics that come up affect all of us one way or another, and we need to know.

2827
02:21:56,380 --> 02:22:00,460
For some people, podcasts are the only way people find out anything, so please keep

2828
02:22:00,460 --> 02:22:01,020
it up.

2829
02:22:01,020 --> 02:22:03,820
There's a lot more I want to discuss, but the show is only so long.

2830
02:22:03,820 --> 02:22:05,180
That's all for now.

2831
02:22:05,180 --> 02:22:06,300
Take care, one and all.

2832
02:22:07,020 --> 02:22:07,900
That's from Rajan.

2833
02:22:07,900 --> 02:22:11,500
To be clear on the politics thing, it's not that I want to completely steer clear of politics.

2834
02:22:11,500 --> 02:22:15,740
And I think what ties into some of what you said, too, is that keep in mind that Dark

2835
02:22:15,740 --> 02:22:20,540
Sakura and I both also represent marginalized communities in one way or another.

2836
02:22:20,540 --> 02:22:23,340
We've not been shy about that over the years of the show.

2837
02:22:23,340 --> 02:22:25,820
And to Loki's credit as well, because it's his show, too.

2838
02:22:25,820 --> 02:22:30,940
Even if he is our token, cis-het, white guy on the show, he knows when to listen.

2839
02:22:30,940 --> 02:22:36,380
For all this crap we give Loki about, he says a lot when it comes to Nintendo and how it's

2840
02:22:36,380 --> 02:22:36,780
run.

2841
02:22:37,100 --> 02:22:39,740
So the other thing is Loki knows when to listen.

2842
02:22:39,740 --> 02:22:40,300
Right, Loki?

2843
02:22:42,140 --> 02:22:43,980
That's actually the first step of allyship.

2844
02:22:45,020 --> 02:22:46,220
Absolutely.

2845
02:22:46,220 --> 02:22:47,100
Absolutely it is.

2846
02:22:47,740 --> 02:22:49,980
And the thing is, don't listen to reply.

2847
02:22:50,860 --> 02:22:51,900
Listen to absorb.

2848
02:22:52,620 --> 02:22:53,420
Don't.

2849
02:22:53,420 --> 02:22:55,340
And not everything.

2850
02:22:56,060 --> 02:22:57,820
It's taken me time to learn this, too.

2851
02:22:58,380 --> 02:23:00,300
Not everything needs to be tweeted.

2852
02:23:01,180 --> 02:23:02,940
Sometimes, just listen.

2853
02:23:03,580 --> 02:23:04,620
That's all you need to do.

2854
02:23:05,180 --> 02:23:05,500
Read.

2855
02:23:05,500 --> 02:23:06,000
Oh.

2856
02:23:06,780 --> 02:23:08,140
And I'll add this, too.

2857
02:23:08,140 --> 02:23:10,300
Sometimes not everything is about you.

2858
02:23:10,300 --> 02:23:12,300
That's, that's right, too.

2859
02:23:12,300 --> 02:23:13,100
Absolutely.

2860
02:23:13,740 --> 02:23:15,980
So I told that to somebody and he blocked me.

2861
02:23:17,500 --> 02:23:21,740
But as far as the politics is concerned, I'm not like, look, I do not want this to be one

2862
02:23:21,740 --> 02:23:22,540
of those.

2863
02:23:22,540 --> 02:23:23,980
This is a chill stream.

2864
02:23:23,980 --> 02:23:26,140
Therefore, we don't talk about politics.

2865
02:23:26,140 --> 02:23:29,100
Like, politics affects everybody.

2866
02:23:29,100 --> 02:23:33,980
And for many of the reasons we've outlined before on this program, I don't need to rehash

2867
02:23:33,980 --> 02:23:35,020
them right now.

2868
02:23:35,020 --> 02:23:41,260
My stance is, I want to find the balance of making sure we're still covering the topic

2869
02:23:41,260 --> 02:23:47,420
that people came here to discuss and interjecting as well an awareness of the world around us

2870
02:23:47,420 --> 02:23:48,700
that these games exist in.

2871
02:23:48,700 --> 02:23:54,220
So sometimes I just want to walk the line of finding that balance and making sure that

2872
02:23:54,860 --> 02:24:03,180
we are doing our best to educate, show the other perspectives, and not berate.

2873
02:24:03,180 --> 02:24:09,020
Although there are some things that need to be berated, last name Kotick, first name Bobby,

2874
02:24:09,020 --> 02:24:11,900
as an example, not the Bobby that's on this network.

2875
02:24:11,900 --> 02:24:12,860
You all know what I'm talking about.

2876
02:24:12,860 --> 02:24:14,780
There's more that needs to be done apart from beration.

2877
02:24:14,780 --> 02:24:18,060
So that's kind of my stance on it.

2878
02:24:18,060 --> 02:24:21,260
So just just know, like, sometimes if I'm like, Okay, let's move on.

2879
02:24:21,260 --> 02:24:25,900
It's only because I'm, I'm realizing that the politics talk has taken up a really, really

2880
02:24:25,900 --> 02:24:26,940
good chunk of the show.

2881
02:24:27,500 --> 02:24:32,540
And sometimes all you can do, and I talked about this, we talked about the game that

2882
02:24:32,540 --> 02:24:33,340
shall not be named.

2883
02:24:34,380 --> 02:24:38,780
Sometimes all you could do is put the information in front of somebody.

2884
02:24:39,660 --> 02:24:41,900
Watch how they use that information.

2885
02:24:42,940 --> 02:24:46,860
That will inform what your relationship may or may not look like moving forward,

2886
02:24:47,500 --> 02:24:49,820
how they treat receiving that information.

2887
02:24:50,780 --> 02:24:51,820
And it's as simple as that.

2888
02:24:54,300 --> 02:24:54,800
Good email.

2889
02:24:55,580 --> 02:24:56,700
Yes, very good email.

2890
02:24:57,420 --> 02:25:03,020
I'm going to go ahead and pull up the other email from YYR.

2891
02:25:04,380 --> 02:25:04,860
All right.

2892
02:25:04,860 --> 02:25:06,140
Oh, the font is so small.

2893
02:25:07,740 --> 02:25:12,060
Well, I mean, which is fine by me, I can read small font, but it's just all of a sudden

2894
02:25:12,060 --> 02:25:13,340
it was like, Oh, this is much smaller.

2895
02:25:13,980 --> 02:25:14,860
Hello, LR.

2896
02:25:14,860 --> 02:25:19,740
I was super happy to hear that After Burner Climax was chosen as last episode's ORL classic

2897
02:25:19,740 --> 02:25:20,700
game of the week.

2898
02:25:20,700 --> 02:25:22,460
I've put a lot of hours into that game.

2899
02:25:22,460 --> 02:25:25,500
It's one of my favorite Sega games of the Lindbergh era.

2900
02:25:25,500 --> 02:25:27,980
It's an action packed masterpiece in every respect.

2901
02:25:27,980 --> 02:25:32,460
And to see an almost arcade perfect port make its way to Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 seemed

2902
02:25:32,460 --> 02:25:33,580
like a surreal miracle.

2903
02:25:34,220 --> 02:25:36,540
The announcement of the port came out of nowhere.

2904
02:25:36,540 --> 02:25:39,580
You might be wondering just how did that happen anyway?

2905
02:25:39,580 --> 02:25:40,380
Well, I have a theory.

2906
02:25:41,660 --> 02:25:44,940
One of you mentioned the After Burner styled level in Bayonetta.

2907
02:25:44,940 --> 02:25:45,660
I think that was me.

2908
02:25:46,540 --> 02:25:53,180
Well, there was an article posted by Destructoid in October 2009, link below, sorry, about

2909
02:25:53,180 --> 02:25:58,380
an interview with Bayonetta creator Hideki Kamiya shortly after the game was released.

2910
02:25:58,380 --> 02:26:02,380
Kamiya was asked what Sega game he wanted to see next.

2911
02:26:03,020 --> 02:26:07,180
And out of all the millions of things he could have asked for, he instead humbly requested

2912
02:26:07,180 --> 02:26:09,100
a home version of After Burner Climax.

2913
02:26:09,740 --> 02:26:12,220
I remember seeing this article when it came out.

2914
02:26:12,220 --> 02:26:15,980
I'm not sure if OLR covered it, but I didn't have time to check.

2915
02:26:15,980 --> 02:26:20,060
But surely enough, six months later, boom, Kamiya got his wish and so did everyone else

2916
02:26:20,140 --> 02:26:23,980
looking for a thrilling fight combat game in the comfort of their homes.

2917
02:26:23,980 --> 02:26:27,900
There's only one thing in the arcade version that didn't make it home, the two-player

2918
02:26:27,900 --> 02:26:29,100
pair play mode.

2919
02:26:29,100 --> 02:26:30,860
Sadly, I've never been able to try it.

2920
02:26:30,860 --> 02:26:34,060
I wonder if there are any arcades left that have two working machines.

2921
02:26:34,060 --> 02:26:35,420
Yeah, I've only seen a single machine.

2922
02:26:36,700 --> 02:26:41,100
One thing I absolutely must mention regarding this game is that I was engaged in hardcore

2923
02:26:41,100 --> 02:26:46,700
head-to-head combat with fellow longtime listener SSJ100 Matt on Xbox 360, on the Xbox 360

2924
02:26:46,700 --> 02:26:47,260
version.

2925
02:26:47,260 --> 02:26:50,140
We went back and forth for, what, a whole year, maybe more?

2926
02:26:50,140 --> 02:26:54,940
Each of us topped the other's previous best score more than a handful of times until finally

2927
02:26:54,940 --> 02:27:03,980
Matt achieved his current best of 1,631,770, number 121 overall on the leaderboard out

2928
02:27:03,980 --> 02:27:12,540
of almost 59,000 players, besting my 185th place personal record by about 140K.

2929
02:27:13,500 --> 02:27:17,180
I've always intended to go back and put in the work, but I'll be honest, it's been

2930
02:27:17,180 --> 02:27:21,020
over 10 years since then and I'm not sure my reflexes are still good enough to improve

2931
02:27:21,020 --> 02:27:23,100
any further, but that's a thing for another time.

2932
02:27:23,740 --> 02:27:27,340
And then, Jamie, I did not miss your mention of Deadstorm Pirates.

2933
02:27:27,340 --> 02:27:29,100
That is another one of my favorite games.

2934
02:27:29,100 --> 02:27:34,140
In fact, it's the very first video game I ever played with my wife, Amy, in the Times

2935
02:27:34,140 --> 02:27:35,740
Square Dave and Busters.

2936
02:27:35,740 --> 02:27:41,260
I still have my PS3 hooked up and my two Guncon 3s handy whenever we need to go back to it,

2937
02:27:41,260 --> 02:27:43,900
and my four-year-old already enjoys watching us play it.

2938
02:27:43,980 --> 02:27:48,220
If for some reason you wanted to make Deadstorm a classic game of the week, I would absolutely

2939
02:27:48,220 --> 02:27:50,300
love the opportunity to produce the segment.

2940
02:27:50,300 --> 02:27:50,800
Hey, cool.

2941
02:27:51,340 --> 02:27:54,540
You just tell me how much time to fill and I will fill it.

2942
02:27:55,420 --> 02:28:00,860
Side note, I probably will record audio and send it to you if you do it.

2943
02:28:01,580 --> 02:28:04,780
So then you'll know what to fill.

2944
02:28:06,300 --> 02:28:11,180
Also going to say if we forecast that you're going to be out for a week in the future,

2945
02:28:11,180 --> 02:28:13,660
that might be a thing we can do for a guest segment.

2946
02:28:14,860 --> 02:28:16,140
I'll also end on this.

2947
02:28:16,140 --> 02:28:21,260
I did not miss the mention of the Game Grumps playing super multitasking on their stream.

2948
02:28:21,260 --> 02:28:23,340
Thank you very much as always for the kind words.

2949
02:28:23,340 --> 02:28:28,220
I will say that unfortunately, this alone did not create the sustained word of mouth

2950
02:28:28,220 --> 02:28:30,940
that would have been required for the game to actually become popular.

2951
02:28:30,940 --> 02:28:35,180
However, I did get enough money out of it to buy a brand new gaming computer and monitor

2952
02:28:35,180 --> 02:28:36,860
replace my 10-year-old Frankenrig.

2953
02:28:37,740 --> 02:28:45,580
So I can now play DDR at 120 FPS since the latest PC version supports that and I'm all

2954
02:28:45,580 --> 02:28:49,100
set for early access on Hades 2 whenever that happens.

2955
02:28:49,100 --> 02:28:51,260
Damn right I have my priorities straight.

2956
02:28:51,260 --> 02:28:53,740
Oh, there was one other awesome thing that came out of this.

2957
02:28:53,740 --> 02:28:57,180
I finally have double digit reviews on Steam.

2958
02:28:57,180 --> 02:28:59,420
So now I have an average rating.

2959
02:28:59,420 --> 02:29:01,580
Positive instead of nine user reviews.

2960
02:29:02,700 --> 02:29:04,540
That was up there for literally years.

2961
02:29:04,540 --> 02:29:05,040
Woohoo!

2962
02:29:05,360 --> 02:29:08,880
Sorry for the long email, although I guess I'm not that sorry.

2963
02:29:08,880 --> 02:29:10,320
Otherwise I wouldn't have sent it.

2964
02:29:10,320 --> 02:29:10,720
Oh well.

2965
02:29:10,720 --> 02:29:14,320
Thanks again for the show and congrats on the big 950.

2966
02:29:14,320 --> 02:29:15,200
See you later.

2967
02:29:15,200 --> 02:29:16,080
Aaron Yyr.

2968
02:29:16,640 --> 02:29:17,520
Thanks Yyr.

2969
02:29:17,520 --> 02:29:25,680
And although I'm disappointed to hear that the moment in the spotlight of your game is

2970
02:29:25,680 --> 02:29:29,760
not sustaining, a new computer is a pretty nice tip.

2971
02:29:29,760 --> 02:29:34,480
So I'm glad at least you're getting something that you can spoil yourself with out of that

2972
02:29:34,480 --> 02:29:39,520
because you've done so many fun things and poured your heart into these projects between

2973
02:29:39,520 --> 02:29:43,120
Bungie ferret tossing and super multitasking and so forth.

2974
02:29:43,120 --> 02:29:47,360
I'm really glad that now you at least can get something tangible out of it.

2975
02:29:47,360 --> 02:29:53,200
So while I still wish your game would get the visibility on a mass scale that it deserves,

2976
02:29:54,160 --> 02:29:55,760
I'm really glad at least you got a moment.

2977
02:29:56,960 --> 02:30:00,080
To quote my spouse, it beats a sharp stick in the eye.

2978
02:30:00,080 --> 02:30:01,520
It does beat a sharp stick in the eye.

2979
02:30:01,520 --> 02:30:02,160
And you know what?

2980
02:30:02,160 --> 02:30:02,880
That's true.

2981
02:30:02,880 --> 02:30:08,000
Sometimes, and believe me, I know this from doing a podcast for 21 years.

2982
02:30:08,000 --> 02:30:09,200
My co-host will probably agree.

2983
02:30:09,760 --> 02:30:13,120
Sometimes you don't want to be in the spotlight.

2984
02:30:13,120 --> 02:30:19,440
Sometimes being at that, I'm getting a new computer that maybe that's an okay level to

2985
02:30:19,440 --> 02:30:19,760
be at.

2986
02:30:21,920 --> 02:30:22,320
All right.

2987
02:30:22,880 --> 02:30:24,400
I could use a little bit more spotlight.

2988
02:30:24,960 --> 02:30:29,120
Well, you might have one coming, so we'll see.

2989
02:30:29,120 --> 02:30:29,600
We'll see.

2990
02:30:30,640 --> 02:30:30,960
All right.

2991
02:30:31,840 --> 02:30:35,280
It's hard to be enthusiastic like about that kind of stuff.

2992
02:30:35,280 --> 02:30:40,000
Like, you know, kids are, you know, like I said, we've been doing this for like 21 years

2993
02:30:40,000 --> 02:30:42,240
and we're still in so much obscurity.

2994
02:30:42,240 --> 02:30:43,600
Go, okay, wait, what?

2995
02:30:43,600 --> 02:30:51,360
How do I, how do I find that that reply that you wrote to the Minecraft people with your

2996
02:30:51,360 --> 02:30:51,600
video?

2997
02:30:51,600 --> 02:30:56,640
Oh, you just, it was just hashtag, what was it?

2998
02:30:56,640 --> 02:31:02,640
It's hashtag feature me Minecraft is all in word.

2999
02:31:02,640 --> 02:31:03,360
Okay, hold on.

3000
02:31:03,360 --> 02:31:07,200
Cause I'm going to, I'm going to forget because we got to, we got to find the way to help

3001
02:31:07,200 --> 02:31:08,480
help Loki out right now.

3002
02:31:08,480 --> 02:31:08,720
Okay.

3003
02:31:08,720 --> 02:31:09,760
So feature me Minecraft.

3004
02:31:09,760 --> 02:31:11,840
Well, some people have some pretty interesting things here.

3005
02:31:11,840 --> 02:31:12,080
Okay.

3006
02:31:12,080 --> 02:31:13,760
Oh, look, look, fourth window.

3007
02:31:13,760 --> 02:31:14,880
Oh my gosh.

3008
02:31:14,880 --> 02:31:17,360
Look at this is such a good screenshot that you have here.

3009
02:31:17,360 --> 02:31:22,320
And for the podcast listeners, it's one of the fish from the bubble man stage in, in

3010
02:31:24,320 --> 02:31:25,040
is that the name of it?

3011
02:31:25,040 --> 02:31:25,840
I never knew the name.

3012
02:31:25,840 --> 02:31:26,240
Yeah.

3013
02:31:26,960 --> 02:31:28,400
Recreated in Minecraft.

3014
02:31:28,400 --> 02:31:29,600
These are so cool.

3015
02:31:29,600 --> 02:31:35,920
And in 3d it's, it's hard because Anko had literally three illustrations of it.

3016
02:31:35,920 --> 02:31:36,480
That is it.

3017
02:31:36,480 --> 02:31:38,720
That is all that exists and same with Octoper.

3018
02:31:38,720 --> 02:31:41,520
So here's what I'm going to do to help Loki out to get noticed.

3019
02:31:41,520 --> 02:31:45,600
I'm going to make sure I like that post most importantly, and then I'm going to reply to

3020
02:31:45,600 --> 02:31:49,120
it and I'm going to put, this is so cool.

3021
02:31:49,120 --> 02:31:51,120
I hope they pick you.

3022
02:31:51,520 --> 02:31:56,880
And then I'm going to retweet it and look at that.

3023
02:31:56,880 --> 02:31:58,480
I'm helping with visibility.

3024
02:31:58,480 --> 02:32:00,240
So I appreciate that.

3025
02:32:00,240 --> 02:32:05,120
If everybody goes in there and does something similar, I mean, don't make it obvious.

3026
02:32:05,120 --> 02:32:09,600
You were told to do so, but just like a retweet, it's going to help Loki out big time.

3027
02:32:09,600 --> 02:32:12,640
If even just like five people listening tonight did that, it would be helpful.

3028
02:32:12,640 --> 02:32:14,240
So awesome.

3029
02:32:15,680 --> 02:32:16,400
Good luck to you.

3030
02:32:17,600 --> 02:32:17,840
All right.

3031
02:32:17,840 --> 02:32:18,400
What?

3032
02:32:19,040 --> 02:32:22,320
I just, uh, Bobby.

3033
02:32:22,320 --> 02:32:23,440
What, uh, what did he say?

3034
02:32:24,880 --> 02:32:28,960
Well, like how Rob doesn't use the arrows between the four images and encloses the real

3035
02:32:31,120 --> 02:32:33,920
look, that's how often I use Twitter anymore.

3036
02:32:33,920 --> 02:32:34,880
That's for sure.

3037
02:32:34,880 --> 02:32:36,240
Hey, even, wow.

3038
02:32:36,240 --> 02:32:36,640
Wow.

3039
02:32:36,640 --> 02:32:43,040
Loki, this, this alone should be worth the hours upon hours of effort you put into this.

3040
02:32:43,120 --> 02:32:47,680
Shad Leland or Shane is in chat saying that stuff was top notch.

3041
02:32:47,680 --> 02:32:48,640
No joke.

3042
02:32:48,640 --> 02:32:50,480
Shane isn't impressed by anything.

3043
02:32:50,480 --> 02:32:52,480
Isn't like, you know, Pokemon.

3044
02:32:52,480 --> 02:32:55,600
So that's quite the compliment.

3045
02:32:55,600 --> 02:33:03,360
That one build, the Octopus, the Octoper, um, took like, it was like 80 hours or so to

3046
02:33:03,360 --> 02:33:07,680
put together and it's, it's 300,000 blocks.

3047
02:33:08,480 --> 02:33:10,720
That's my starter base, that one right there, the met.

3048
02:33:10,720 --> 02:33:11,840
So that, that's always fun.

3049
02:33:12,560 --> 02:33:14,800
Yeah, but that one right there and they're all functional too.

3050
02:33:14,800 --> 02:33:18,080
So like that right there is a guardian or a guardian farm.

3051
02:33:18,080 --> 02:33:24,880
So underneath there's a, um, a guardian temple and they go inside there and then they end

3052
02:33:24,880 --> 02:33:30,640
up in an XP farm and then the Octoper is actually covering up a stacking raid farm.

3053
02:33:30,640 --> 02:33:32,480
So it's all functional stuff.

3054
02:33:32,480 --> 02:33:33,920
Um, and it's huge.

3055
02:33:33,920 --> 02:33:40,560
Like even just building in my base, I am now like, I see that Octopus out just on the ocean,

3056
02:33:40,560 --> 02:33:41,440
like out there.

3057
02:33:41,440 --> 02:33:43,040
It's, it's enormous.

3058
02:33:43,040 --> 02:33:44,960
My base is going to be enormous.

3059
02:33:45,680 --> 02:33:47,040
It already is enormous.

3060
02:33:47,040 --> 02:33:51,360
And each, each section of the base I do is like a size of another mega base.

3061
02:33:51,360 --> 02:33:53,120
It's like ridiculous.

3062
02:33:53,120 --> 02:33:54,800
Well, and, and Shane and anyone listed.

3063
02:33:54,800 --> 02:33:58,400
So Shane actually further went on to say it honestly looks better than the official Mega

3064
02:33:58,400 --> 02:33:59,840
Man X pack they just put out.

3065
02:33:59,840 --> 02:34:03,760
Well, keep in mind, Loki gives tours of all of these in his videos.

3066
02:34:03,760 --> 02:34:06,720
So if you aren't, you know, for those that have no idea, cause they're listening on the

3067
02:34:06,720 --> 02:34:07,920
podcast feed, which is great.

3068
02:34:07,920 --> 02:34:08,800
We love you too.

3069
02:34:09,120 --> 02:34:14,080
Loki's Twitter to retweet and all that is over at Loki O L R all one word, uh, on Twitter.

3070
02:34:14,080 --> 02:34:16,720
And then, uh, of course his YouTube channel is same thing, right?

3071
02:34:16,720 --> 02:34:17,920
Or is there an underscore on YouTube?

3072
02:34:17,920 --> 02:34:21,440
It's well, YouTube has that wonderful at thing now.

3073
02:34:21,440 --> 02:34:25,200
So you can just do youtube.com slash at Loki O L R.

3074
02:34:25,200 --> 02:34:26,000
Perfect.

3075
02:34:26,000 --> 02:34:29,680
So, and then, uh, make sure you can actually watch those videos.

3076
02:34:29,680 --> 02:34:31,840
So fabulous.

3077
02:34:31,840 --> 02:34:33,520
Just past 800 subs.

3078
02:34:33,520 --> 02:34:36,160
So slowly making it there.

3079
02:34:36,160 --> 02:34:37,520
And subs are free.

3080
02:34:37,520 --> 02:34:38,960
They're like follows on Twitch.

3081
02:34:38,960 --> 02:34:41,760
That's the free cause sub on Twitch means money.

3082
02:34:41,760 --> 02:34:42,640
But yeah.

3083
02:34:43,920 --> 02:34:44,240
Wow.

3084
02:34:44,240 --> 02:34:46,160
I think you, you know what?

3085
02:34:46,160 --> 02:34:51,600
You have more follows on YouTube than I think dark Sakura or I or VOG network have on Twitch.

3086
02:34:51,600 --> 02:34:54,560
So maybe you shouldn't be complaining.

3087
02:34:55,600 --> 02:34:56,720
I'm getting there.

3088
02:34:56,720 --> 02:34:57,680
Yeah, no, you are.

3089
02:34:57,680 --> 02:34:58,320
You are.

3090
02:34:58,320 --> 02:35:02,080
Um, uh, I think fog and network is sadly in last place.

3091
02:35:02,080 --> 02:35:04,320
We need to, we need to up the visibility here.

3092
02:35:04,320 --> 02:35:08,320
It's not a contest, but, uh, we need to up the visibility here at VOG network because

3093
02:35:08,320 --> 02:35:10,320
when one of us wins, we all win.

3094
02:35:10,960 --> 02:35:12,320
That's the power of network.

3095
02:35:12,320 --> 02:35:15,520
By the way, we need to have a power meeting.

3096
02:35:17,520 --> 02:35:17,840
Okay.

3097
02:35:19,040 --> 02:35:20,800
Soon, but not tonight.

3098
02:35:20,800 --> 02:35:21,120
All right.

3099
02:35:22,400 --> 02:35:22,720
All right.

3100
02:35:23,600 --> 02:35:25,040
Uh, I think with that, we're done.

3101
02:35:25,040 --> 02:35:28,560
I didn't see anybody join the green room, so that is it.

3102
02:35:28,560 --> 02:35:31,040
Plus we're running a little long anyway, so I want to make sure we wrap up.

3103
02:35:31,040 --> 02:35:34,560
I already told you I'm starting to fade as the night goes on and I get to go back to

3104
02:35:34,560 --> 02:35:35,120
work tomorrow.

3105
02:35:35,120 --> 02:35:35,680
Woo.

3106
02:35:35,680 --> 02:35:36,880
At least I work at home.

3107
02:35:36,880 --> 02:35:40,160
I get to message the queen of chaos.

3108
02:35:40,160 --> 02:35:45,040
I get to read 5,000 emails when I get back to work tomorrow.

3109
02:35:45,040 --> 02:35:48,560
So let's go around and get final thoughts and say our good nights and all that good

3110
02:35:48,560 --> 02:35:48,880
stuff.

3111
02:35:48,880 --> 02:35:50,720
Um, dark Sakura, of course, I'll start with you.

3112
02:35:50,720 --> 02:35:53,600
I know you're going to go do some dead by daylight after the show tonight.

3113
02:35:53,600 --> 02:35:56,160
Um, do you have a final thought for our listeners tonight?

3114
02:35:57,120 --> 02:36:01,920
Um, you know how everyone, how people call dead by daylight, Debbie delight.

3115
02:36:03,120 --> 02:36:09,040
I was watching some scenes from singles the other day and there's the character Debbie

3116
02:36:09,680 --> 02:36:13,120
and all of a sudden my brain went to come to where the action is.

3117
02:36:13,680 --> 02:36:14,960
Come to Debbie town.

3118
02:36:16,720 --> 02:36:19,200
And you'd have to see that movie to get it.

3119
02:36:19,200 --> 02:36:22,080
But well, stay tuned for some Debbie town after the show.

3120
02:36:22,880 --> 02:36:23,360
Yep.

3121
02:36:23,360 --> 02:36:24,160
Later taters.

3122
02:36:24,160 --> 02:36:24,800
All right.

3123
02:36:24,800 --> 02:36:25,280
Bye bye.

3124
02:36:25,840 --> 02:36:27,200
I forgot my usual spiel.

3125
02:36:27,200 --> 02:36:29,840
If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Lodge Radio, tell a friend or two about the

3126
02:36:29,840 --> 02:36:30,240
show.

3127
02:36:30,240 --> 02:36:32,960
Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we

3128
02:36:32,960 --> 02:36:35,120
need more voices to put out on air.

3129
02:36:35,120 --> 02:36:40,080
A nice five star review on a site like iTunes or Spotify, wherever it is you found this

3130
02:36:40,080 --> 02:36:42,400
show, those go an awful long way.

3131
02:36:42,400 --> 02:36:45,040
A like and a retweet go an awful long way.

3132
02:36:45,040 --> 02:36:45,680
That's for sure.

3133
02:36:46,480 --> 02:36:48,000
Loki, your final thought for tonight?

3134
02:36:48,880 --> 02:36:51,600
I'm just going to be working more on content creation.

3135
02:36:51,600 --> 02:36:58,400
Still want to try to get back down to weekly videos, but it's just I do too.

3136
02:36:58,400 --> 02:36:59,760
I overscope everything.

3137
02:36:59,760 --> 02:37:00,880
You know, it's a problem.

3138
02:37:02,080 --> 02:37:05,600
But at the same time, those Mega Man things.

3139
02:37:05,600 --> 02:37:07,120
God damn, that's so impressive.

3140
02:37:07,120 --> 02:37:08,880
So yeah, although yes, I agree.

3141
02:37:08,880 --> 02:37:11,440
And you do need to lower your scope.

3142
02:37:11,440 --> 02:37:14,240
Damn, sometimes when you do it, it's like, okay, wow.

3143
02:37:14,240 --> 02:37:15,120
Yeah, I mean, it's

3144
02:37:15,120 --> 02:37:16,400
I can't help myself.

3145
02:37:16,400 --> 02:37:17,920
I have to keep doing that.

3146
02:37:17,920 --> 02:37:20,400
Think about the advice I gave Square Enix earlier.

3147
02:37:21,120 --> 02:37:23,760
Do the low hanging fruit to give that platform.

3148
02:37:23,760 --> 02:37:24,720
I know.

3149
02:37:24,720 --> 02:37:26,400
I just need to pace myself.

3150
02:37:27,520 --> 02:37:28,020
Yes, you do.

3151
02:37:29,200 --> 02:37:29,520
All right.

3152
02:37:30,080 --> 02:37:34,880
My final thought is I'll be back to doing some streaming this week as well over my personal

3153
02:37:34,880 --> 02:37:35,920
channel, Rob Roberts.

3154
02:37:35,920 --> 02:37:40,640
I will be doing some theater rhythm a couple days this week, and I'll be doing No Man's

3155
02:37:40,640 --> 02:37:42,720
Sky on Tuesday, Thursday.

3156
02:37:43,280 --> 02:37:47,760
Of course, again, Star Trek Cruise wrap up here at VOG Network.

3157
02:37:47,760 --> 02:37:48,480
So check that out.

3158
02:37:48,560 --> 02:37:52,240
If nothing else, even if you could give a shit about Star Trek or the Cruise, come watch

3159
02:37:52,240 --> 02:37:54,480
me get yelled at for playing Overwatch badly.

3160
02:37:54,480 --> 02:37:57,760
I'm subjecting myself to that for y'all's entertainment.

3161
02:37:57,760 --> 02:37:58,560
That's going to do it.

3162
02:37:59,440 --> 02:38:06,480
Thanks so much for being here for our 950th episode, 50 more until we hit 1000 weekly

3163
02:38:06,480 --> 02:38:07,120
podcasts.

3164
02:38:07,120 --> 02:38:12,000
And not a lot of internet shows have hit 1000 weekly episodes.

3165
02:38:12,000 --> 02:38:16,560
I know some other like gaming and other shows, they've hit 1000 episodes for maybe multiples

3166
02:38:16,560 --> 02:38:17,440
a week and so forth.

3167
02:38:18,080 --> 02:38:22,640
Not a lot on any topic, really, that have made the 1000 weekly episodes club.

3168
02:38:22,640 --> 02:38:29,360
So thank you all for making that a distinct reality for our show as we move in to the

3169
02:38:29,360 --> 02:38:31,840
next year and beyond.

3170
02:38:32,400 --> 02:38:33,360
Have a good week, everybody.

3171
02:38:33,360 --> 02:38:36,320
We'll see you next time here on Orange Lounge Radio.

3172
02:38:36,320 --> 02:38:36,800
