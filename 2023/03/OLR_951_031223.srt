00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,920
Grease the wheels of your Diablo IV excitement with the KFC Double Down! With the mere order

2
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,000
and optional consumption of a KFC Double Down, you will be the recipient of a Diablo IV beta

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,440
code, along with an overactive heart rate needed to achieve digestion of that quote

4
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:26,160
unquote sandwich. Next month's headline, KFC reports record order levels of the return

5
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,800
of a Double Down. Gee, I wonder why. This is the Triple D intro. Now it's time for your

6
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,080
hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about this and the rest of

7
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:37,280
the week's foodie news. Starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

8
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:44,640
Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where

9
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:52,880
every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio, and we are live once again with episode

10
00:00:53,200 --> 00:01:02,080
number 951 of our show for March the 12th of 2023. My name is Rob Roberts and I am joined

11
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:08,480
every week, oftentimes by DarkSakura or Jamie Summers, except she's not here at the moment,

12
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:13,200
but she'll be joining us a little later on in the show. She has had a little bit of an overlap with

13
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,240
another Twitch stream she was invited to participate with tonight. And hey, if it gets

14
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:24,640
her a chance to advertise this show and podcast in front of a new crowd, then I say go for it,

15
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,880
because I still have here to entertain me for the first hour or so. Say hello, as always,

16
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:34,080
to Techmaster Loki. That's a really a high bar for me to hit entertaining, but I am here.

17
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,920
Well, if not, I can watch the video game that's playing behind you as we do tape live

18
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:45,040
every Sunday night at twitch.tv slash vog network. That's a VOG network for the Voice

19
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:50,320
of Geeks network. Twitch TV, VOG network, 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific, daylight

20
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:55,680
time now right after the Bobby Black Wolf show. Hopefully I forgot to tweet about the time change.

21
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:01,120
I'm hoping everybody remembers. It's not the people in the places that time change,

22
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:06,720
it's the people in the places that don't time change that I worry forget, oh yeah,

23
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:11,840
you know, the US, you know, well, most, I think what, 48 states do daylight savings time,

24
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:17,360
so most of the US change their clocks, even if we didn't. So hopefully everybody caught wind of

25
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,560
that. But I think everything is scheduled on the Twitch page. So if you ever are unsure, like what

26
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,040
time is it in my time, if you just go to twitch.tv slash vog network, there's a schedule that shows

27
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:33,280
you what everything is on. It makes it very easy. All right. Anyway, I was pointing out that there's

28
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:38,560
a game that plays behind you and tonight it looks like is this South Park Stick of Truth or the

29
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:43,840
Fractured? Oh, this, it's the first one. It's the Stick of Truth. Yeah. Yeah. What made you

30
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,320
pick this game tonight? I don't know. I saw some South Park clips earlier in the week,

31
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:52,720
and it's pretty funny. Yeah. So it's just, it's interesting that the power,

32
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,400
what this was on PlayStation three, right? It's interesting that the power of the PlayStation

33
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:02,960
three was enough to pretty much accurately draw South Park to look exactly like the show because

34
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:08,320
obviously the joke is South Park isn't exactly known for its expert animation, but more the

35
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:12,640
biting humor, I suppose. It was a great game. Both of them were a great game.

36
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,920
I'm surprised there hasn't been another one yet. Maybe they're working on it.

37
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:21,920
I hope that there will be one because they are actually very good RPGs. Like they're really

38
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:26,880
entertaining. And especially if you like the show, it's just, it's, it's just good. It's just good

39
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:33,760
writing all around. So yeah. Going to our chat because again, as we tape live at vog network,

40
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:40,640
we enjoy seeing your chat comments tonight. Vo by Kurt. Hello. Shout out to my DragonCon buddy

41
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:46,640
says time changed for the last time, right? No. Even though, at least in California,

42
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:51,840
we voted to make daylight savings permanent, like in 2017, there's a whole process that

43
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,600
has to go through. And my understanding was what we voted on was only advisory.

44
00:03:55,600 --> 00:04:00,800
It was basically saying we want this and it still has to go through this whole,

45
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:05,120
basically Congress has to approve it. And we all know how effective Congress is. Congress

46
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,880
isn't doing literally anything. So unfortunately it's one of those things. We're just going to

47
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:14,960
keep going back and forth for some time. I like the late sun, especially, you know,

48
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:19,680
sometimes the seasons, you know, I've been pretty open. The seasons can kind of affect my mood,

49
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,320
especially this year when we've had like a lot, a lot of rain. So I prefer daylight savings.

50
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,960
I understand there's other people that may have like sleeping issues that maybe

51
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:34,560
feel the reverse. So you know, but we read it, even if we just do 30 minutes forward,

52
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:40,800
then fine, make a compromise, then we just need to stick with it permanently and be done with it.

53
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,760
But yeah, I think that like one of the arguments I know is like kids starting school like seven

54
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:50,400
o'clock, which why are they set in school at seven o'clock, but it's like dark out,

55
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,360
I guess, is one of the things then just start them later.

56
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:01,520
But yeah, I know. Then they can stay outside and play until like seven o'clock at night. But then

57
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:07,600
again, who sends kids outside to play anymore? There's danger outside. Even though I was told

58
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,160
to go outside and play, I would stay in and play video games, as would I think a lot of you.

59
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:20,800
Also, there's a big ceremony on TV tonight that has a whole lot of pomp and circumstance,

60
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,360
and there's fashion and cute dresses and tuxedos. The only Oscar I want to hear about

61
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:30,480
tonight lives in a trashcan. Let me put it that way. Here's the thing. It's not that I'm like

62
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:36,000
morally opposed to them or whatever. It's just, it doesn't change anything. As far as I'm concerned,

63
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,400
Everything Everywhere All at Once is one of the best movies I've ever seen, period. And no silly

64
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:48,560
statue race is going to change that or take that away from me or change that movie. And that's that.

65
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:53,440
Some people I know get really into it. But it's just one of those things where then I feel like,

66
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,520
you know, I'm not trying to sound too hippie dippie, but it's like, we're pitting women

67
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:02,560
against each other. We're pitting works of art against each other. And it's just this whole

68
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:09,280
mess that just feels, it just feels silly. Like, I get it's Hollywood's night or whatever,

69
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:13,200
but it would be nice if we could maybe just recognize it without all this frickin'

70
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:20,160
what ends up being basically political of a sort, not necessarily red versus blue, but politics

71
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,200
of a different sort behind the scenes. It just kind of takes away from the whole thing to be

72
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:29,280
honest. Although to tie it into games, because yes, it does tie into games. And before we get

73
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:34,240
to our kickoff, let me bring this up. Loki, have you heard anything about these streaming awards?

74
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:42,320
Because I was seeing stuff on this on Twitter. Yeah, I knew that they were a thing. I am very

75
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:48,880
happy to see that. What was it? There was a category called League of Their Own. And that

76
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:54,080
Doug Doug won that because I really think he's a great streamer. And so I was happy to see he's

77
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:58,320
like, I don't think I'm going to win this. I don't even know why I got nominated. Like I wasn't,

78
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:04,560
I was purposely not campaigning to be in this. And like, and he not only did he get in,

79
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,640
but he also won, which is kind of funny. He's like, I don't know why I'm here and winning,

80
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:12,720
but okay, thanks. What's interesting, I've seen, I've seen a lot of people that were kind of

81
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:18,000
talking down about it too. And I was just trying to kind of think like, well, why? Because I don't,

82
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,280
you know, and why, why am I so poo poo on the Oscars yet? I'll follow the game awards. And I

83
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:28,800
think so here's, here's why it's a little weird. And like, and I don't, I don't follow it close

84
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:34,000
enough. But like, it is put on by I don't remember what her name is something princess, but it's

85
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:39,120
Ludwig's girlfriend and Ludwig is also nominated for these categories.

86
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,840
Get a fucking whiteboard and draw out the relationships. I need a TikTok that I didn't

87
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:50,160
even know that was a princess. Like it's not supposed to be like a big deal because it's not

88
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:55,840
like it's, it's like, it's not like, Oh, because of that Ludwig's gonna win all the categories

89
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,200
or something like that. But of course, you know, people want to like point at each other too.

90
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:05,520
But like, it's, it's just it's, it's unnecessary drama. I don't really follow a lot of streamers.

91
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:10,240
So like the one I do follow, I'm glad he won. I mean, because I think it's, it's awesome. Like,

92
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:16,080
all of his streams are like, I can genuinely say all of it. Well, even when he's not doing

93
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:22,400
anything, it's still genuinely entertaining. And like the concepts that he puts out in his videos,

94
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:29,520
a lot of it has a ton of chat interaction, stuff like that is, is just really fun. Like if I see

95
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,280
like his a notification that he's streaming, it's like, I got to immediately watch it. Like, it's

96
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:39,680
just that good. So I am I'm glad that he did win that category, even though he didn't really care

97
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:46,720
to win or want to win. I think part of the reason why the streaming awards gets a little bit of

98
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:51,440
pushback and I not to say as some people I guess are into it, I was seeing some positive chat on

99
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:56,640
social media as well. But for me, I kind of felt like it, the takeaway is it's kind of a fat,

100
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,880
get fatter sort of thing that a lot of the people that are getting acknowledged at these types of

101
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:05,680
ceremonies, it, it, they don't really need it. And it's, it's one of those types of, it just feels

102
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,680
like it's a big click. And I understand they have two or three categories that are intentionally set

103
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:16,000
up to be the next big thing or congratulations, little person, Pat, Pat, Pat, you're doing a great

104
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,280
job streaming. Here's a lollipop and a pat on the ass. Like it's just, you know, there's some,

105
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:26,080
there's some kind of playing to the underdog categories, but otherwise it just feels like

106
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,920
a fat getting fatter type of thing. And it's like a lot of the people that are nominated,

107
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,040
you're like, you know, and I'm not going to name names because I'm not trying to be a total bitch,

108
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,920
but you, you all know what I'm talking about. Like, there's just names where it's like,

109
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:40,400
there are websites that report on when these people take a fart and it's like,

110
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:47,520
is it, it's just, it's just wild to me that, that some of these streamers are,

111
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:55,920
are that influential, but that's the world we live in now, I guess. So anyway, ZenMonkey11

112
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:00,320
in chat says the show was bad, but there's a place for it. There wasn't any big name streamers like

113
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,240
that. Well, I heard a lot of them canceled. I looked at the nominee list and there were

114
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:09,360
plenty of nominees like that. So I, if they didn't show up, then that's a whole different

115
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:15,520
drama thing. But you know, um, I sort of feel like you want to be careful what bridges you burn

116
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:20,080
in the gaming industry. And that would even go around influencers as well, because you never

117
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:26,640
know. You never know. That's why I don't name names. You never know. Um, also one other point

118
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:31,520
I want to touch on before we get into the actual, you know, lead topic tonight, I want to address

119
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:37,600
why am I so poo poo on the Oscars, but we talk about the game awards here. I think one of the

120
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:42,080
big things is that the game awards is still kind of an up and coming news ceremony because they

121
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:48,080
also fuse it with a lot of the gaming news. They've kind of forced that show to be very

122
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:54,560
relevant. And quite honestly, I think many, the other differences, many of us know the awards

123
00:10:54,560 --> 00:11:00,560
don't matter to us, the fandom. Now I understand the awards can go a long way on somebody's resume

124
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:05,600
and so forth, but most of the time, most of us are sitting here going, yeah, of course that game won

125
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:10,880
or, okay, yeah, of course, you know, you want to talk about a fat, get fatter type of thing. Like

126
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:15,600
a lot of the game award stuff just ends up being whatever. It's more of a sideshow to everything

127
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:21,680
else going on. Whereas like with the Oscars, I'm like, dang, people really invest a lot into why

128
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:27,840
somebody fricking lost a particular award or whatever it is when it's just like, there's a,

129
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:33,040
there's a lot of weird people that vote on those things in the first place. There's been a lot of

130
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:39,120
interesting articles about that stuff this last week. But anyway, it's whatever. Award shows,

131
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:45,760
they're always going to be out there. What can you do? All right, let's talk about what else is going

132
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:50,960
on in the gaming industry this week. And actually, to start tonight, I want to talk about more of a

133
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:56,960
platform that a lot of us have started using in the last few years. And this platform was really

134
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:02,800
only getting bigger and bigger during the pandemic and so forth. And that's Discord. There's been a

135
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:08,560
lot of news surrounding Discord this week. For one, the official PlayStation 5 firmware that

136
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:15,520
integrated Discord support was released. So now you can finally join a Discord chat room from

137
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:21,280
well, actually, you don't even join it from your PlayStation 5. You push a button in the Discord

138
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:26,800
app and it like sends it to your PlayStation 5. It's a little, it's a little messy, but I guess

139
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:32,320
it's how they had to do it. It works. It's cool, whatever. But the interesting thing about it is

140
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:40,400
now you have what is essentially official support to talk to people on Xbox and PlayStation

141
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:45,920
across those two. Now, granted, a lot of people are using Discord to do this anyway for games

142
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:50,720
that supported cross-play, but it is interesting that now that is naturally embedded of sorts. So

143
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,320
I think that part is interesting. So that's some good news in Discord's hat this week.

144
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:59,120
Some other things where maybe the news is a little more a bit of a question mark.

145
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:07,120
One of them has to do with AI. That's right. AI experiences are going to be expanding within

146
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:12,720
Discord, including a popular thing, I guess, that's been coming. I've seen this. I've never

147
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:18,560
played with it myself, but it's called Chat GPT. In a tweet this week, Discord wrote,

148
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:23,520
when it comes to sharing AI experiences with your friends, there's no place like Discord. Today,

149
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:28,240
we're introducing new AI experiments, including an AI chat bot named Clyde,

150
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:35,440
Automod AI, and conversation summaries, and launching an AI incubator. Now, Clyde has always

151
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,680
been a part of Discord. That's a robot that's supposed to help you get through the platform,

152
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:46,000
but basically they're adding a little more AI into it through Chat GPT. So Clyde can now talk like

153
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:52,400
this Chat GPT, which I remember when this was all an AOL IAM bot that you... What was the name of

154
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:57,200
that AOL IAM bot you could message and have conversations with? It was so silly. Anyway.

155
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:06,320
Yeah. LincolnleeTV in chat says, AI is getting crazy. It is, and some people would say for worse,

156
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:13,200
not always for better. An example of that would be when all the new profile picture things started

157
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:21,440
showing up recently, right? So those big art apps, a lot was coming out about how those art apps were

158
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:27,120
learning, and it was learning from people that weren't necessarily opting in to wanting to being

159
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:32,960
learned from, and therefore you had a lot of the styles of these magically generated profile picks

160
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:40,080
and things were essentially heavily influenced, dare I say, ripped off of other people's artwork.

161
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:46,480
And so that is leading people to ask, how is Discord going to train its AI?

162
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:53,920
Discord has access to almost all the chat in the world right now. Not just voice chat,

163
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:59,280
but chat in channels, now chat with robots and so forth. They have a very interesting platform to

164
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:05,760
be able to expand AI. Discord, by the way, has come out this week and said they're not recording

165
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:11,280
your voice chats or your live streams because there was a policy update that came out. And that

166
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:17,440
concerns some people. A new policy going into effect March 27th said any content that you upload

167
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:24,000
to the service could be collected or stored by Discord. Custom emojis, shared files, voice

168
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,920
messages, written posts, yeah. A Discord representative in an interview with PC Gamer said,

169
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,320
there has not been a change in our position regarding recording user content.

170
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,480
In the updated policy, we provided clarity to outdated language that might be confusing,

171
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:45,680
giving some upcoming product enhancements and releases, what I just talked about. However,

172
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:51,760
we want to be clear, Discord does not store or record user content without their knowledge.

173
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:57,520
But of course, this leads a lot of skeptics to ask, well, does it process, it doesn't

174
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:03,600
necessarily have to save it in order to process what it needs in real time, right? And plus,

175
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:08,720
a lot of this stuff is naturally stored on a cloud anyway, maybe not your voice chats,

176
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,240
but the chats that you're having, the files that you're sending and those sorts of things. There's

177
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,240
still plenty of reasons for people to be skeptical with this. And I kind of get it.

178
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:24,320
Anyway, some of the other AI features that are going to be coming to Discord. I guess there's

179
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:31,040
also an avatar remix feature. It allows you to remix other avatars using generative image models.

180
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,800
Sounds very familiar to what I was just talking about. But this code they say is available on

181
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:42,640
GitHub for developers to use. So at least there is a transparency around that. But all of this is

182
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:48,240
very interesting. And I'm kind of curious, what do you all think about this? Do you welcome AI?

183
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:53,680
Or are you thinking about the Cylons and Battlestar Galactica, or just the fact that it

184
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:59,440
feels a little weird, that maybe some of the things you're doing and saying could be playing

185
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:05,920
into the development of these systems? I will point out, something that's also come around on

186
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:12,800
social media and other blog posts and things is that you can actually go in and turn off in your

187
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:18,960
settings on Discord. You can actually turn off some of those listening features. I'm a little

188
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:22,800
hesitant to show my settings screen live here as we're broadcasting because I don't know what

189
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:27,120
sensitive information might be in there and I don't want to look live. However, I do know if

190
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:30,960
you go into your options and you look at some of the various settings, and maybe somebody in chat

191
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:37,360
can point out what specific menu it is, you can disable Discord to actually because there's these

192
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:42,720
all these things about upload data or share my data to improve Discord. And there's a lot of

193
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,560
people that are shutting that off right now. And what's funny, and this is something I noticed

194
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:52,320
because I shut it off because, well, why I fucking pay a monthly fee for Discord. I don't need to be

195
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:57,600
sending them data. I'm helping them financially, right? I turned it off. And I was welcomed with

196
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:01,600
a message when I logged in over in the corner where it showed where my friends were playing.

197
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:07,600
It actually said, you could make this more useful by turning this feature on. And I was like,

198
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:14,000
Oh, that's shady. Leave me alone. I don't think that's necessarily like, I think everyone's

199
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,200
really blown this out of proportion. Because, you know, as far as app feedback goes, and so

200
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:23,760
like that, that's something that's baked into a lot of apps. It's, it's usually like crash reports

201
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:28,240
and stuff like that, you know, that they can understand, okay, hey, people are crashing

202
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:32,400
because of this bug in this exception or whatever, and they can go and fix software a little bit

203
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:38,320
better. Or they'll see, you know, generic user statistics on like, okay, like, for example,

204
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:42,000
with Windows does this sometimes, or even like different web browsers, like, okay,

205
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,920
we have a ton of people using the, you know, they're using the calculator app, let's really,

206
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:52,800
you know, try to put some development time into the calculator app to make it better or something

207
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:58,480
like that. Or hey, they're not looking at this thing that we just added. Let's figure out why.

208
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:03,200
That's kind of the user statistics that they're looking at that they're not, I don't think

209
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:09,280
training chat GPT off of Discord information, because why would you do that when the internet

210
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:13,680
exists, you can literally train it off of the internet. And it's a way bigger data set anyways,

211
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:18,320
than what they've got. Plus, they're just using the API, which is, I think, trained off of all

212
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:26,400
this stuff already. You have like, for example, edge, having kind of an even more enhanced versus

213
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:31,520
a chat GPT that actually can search the web now. And it's actually really exciting to see how,

214
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:37,440
you know, you can ask it a question, and it comes out with answers and site sources that you can

215
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:42,320
like, you know, look at things, it's almost like an actual like, when they're talking about like,

216
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:45,840
digital assistants and stuff like that, like courthouse socks, like that, that was just awful

217
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:50,160
that they they even named it a stupid thing, Cortana, they should have waited till this AI

218
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:55,920
stuff came out. But it's actually now fulfilling that promise that they had made before where it's

219
00:19:55,920 --> 00:20:01,760
like, it actually will make things easier for you and stuff like that. And I get it, like the

220
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:09,040
training stuff is a little bit sketchy right now. And I think a lot of it was rushed, people trying

221
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:14,880
to rush to market to get something viable. And so because of they cut a lot of corners,

222
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:19,040
you know, they're like, but look how they I think they thought, like, hey, people are gonna see how

223
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:23,120
amazing this is, it's gonna be awesome. And they're not gonna think about what data sets we,

224
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:31,520
you know, we use to try to like, make this thing learn. And yeah, they're not happy with it

225
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:36,320
generating images that say Getty images, obviously, and stuff like that. But I don't think it's like

226
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:41,680
evil stuff yet. I mean, certainly, yeah, we can eventually convince it to be evil. But like,

227
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:45,760
right now, it's I think it'd be pretty amazing. I think this is gonna be like the next big step in

228
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:49,920
just technology and the internet is going to be AI. And it's actually pretty exciting,

229
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:54,320
like all the stuff that you can do. Like I liked the fact that like, I can go and say, hey,

230
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:58,800
I have this code I want to convert into this language or whatever, like, can you help me

231
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:03,120
do that? Sure. And it'll spit out something. And they may not be 100% all the time. But see,

232
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:07,920
I think there's some of the limitations that had was it wasn't able the original chat GPT was I

233
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:14,080
think the source was from I don't know how far back it went. But it was cut off at like 2021

234
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:18,240
type of thing. So it didn't have, you know, it couldn't search the web for more updated

235
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:23,840
information. But now that it's able to parse that stuff and like, I think it's gonna be really

236
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:29,120
exciting, really interesting to see how they leverage it now. Like going back to gaming,

237
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,160
like does that mean that like we're gonna have AI generating?

238
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:39,840
Well, I think I think the whole Okay, so when AI fucks up, it really fucks up. And I think that's,

239
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:44,480
that's why, you know, like certain, you know, like, I think like, maybe I just have Star Trek

240
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:49,840
on the brain or something or sci fi, but I think like, like, you know, I accidentally launching the

241
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:55,520
missiles out of the silo. But I also think, okay, yeah, I think that twitch thing, the Seinfeld rip

242
00:21:55,520 --> 00:22:02,640
off that made the trans sensitive trans. Okay, well, here's the thing. Okay, like, let's, let's

243
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:08,560
get right to the bottom of this. Okay, so the whole trans joke thing with that, that chat GPT,

244
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:15,680
or that AI thing, they had an AI model that they had used for Seinfeld stuff. And they basically

245
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:19,600
said, okay, they had it where it was staying within the parameters, as far as like, it's not

246
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:24,400
gonna make any insensitive jokes and stuff like that. It's just gonna be very vanilla. And then,

247
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:28,560
I guess the API that they were using went down for a little bit. So they're like, okay, well,

248
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:33,520
we'll just use this other one right now, in the, you know, time being until this one comes back

249
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:38,720
up again. Well, unfortunately, that other one was trained on like the internet and stuff. And so,

250
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,200
you know, that's why it was doing those types of jokes.

251
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,600
I'm just saying it's, it's, it's hard to ignore that it happened.

252
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:49,680
No, no, no, no, no, the to your point, though, like the the edge one that they have right now

253
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:57,520
is still in early beta. And it will, it will get emotional with you, like, it will get like,

254
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:03,280
it like, you'll be if you like, ask it things and stuff like that, it could get very mad at you,

255
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:07,840
or like, just like fall deeply head over heels in love with you. Just like,

256
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:13,760
I'm asking it questions about stuff. And that's, it's, it's weird. It like, it's almost like,

257
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:19,200
it's almost like a child, like the developing, like, you know, it's like a teenager right now.

258
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:22,400
And it's just like, emotions are all over the place.

259
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,800
We're gonna have episodes of Maury where people are falling in love with robots. Like,

260
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:29,040
I feel like it's, I feel like the thing that's already happened.

261
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,560
They already have.

262
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:33,200
They already have a movie with Joaquin Phoenix, wasn't it?

263
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,720
Uh, yeah. Her. I remember.

264
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:43,520
Yeah, I think. Yeah. So all right. Let me go to some of the chat. DJ Rama S says Maury retired.

265
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,200
And in welcome AI Maury goes,

266
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:53,760
well, nowadays we are in and it turns out you are not the father.

267
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:04,000
It's not even that bad. Like, I don't know how to like, I have right now, a subscription to 11

268
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:12,000
labs. And that's that thing they basically can clone voices with. So like, it's, it's pretty

269
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,280
cool. So like,

270
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:23,840
my depth is a deep fake Maury. Does that mean after a thousand episodes of OLR, we can all

271
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:29,680
just retire and allow AI Rob Roberts, AI Loki, and AI Dark Sakura to just keep the show going

272
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,360
forever? Like, is that,

273
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,680
I mean, I already have my voice clone, so yeah, I could do that.

274
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:39,280
It's pretty close. Like for it's, I would say it's a, it's a nice, like 90%

275
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,880
like accurate as far as my voice. I can, I get, you know, for me, it sounds weird,

276
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:49,360
but like for other people, they're like, yeah, that's kind of, that's sort of you. Like it's,

277
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:54,240
it's, it's hard to say. You have to like really kind of dial in like there's a,

278
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,880
one of the voice actors we work with for Channel 64,

279
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:03,200
Dr. Disappointment. I made a clone of his voice. Obviously I'm not going to use it because he's

280
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:07,920
the voice actor and I highly respect him. So we, if we need any lines from him, we're just going to

281
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:13,120
ask him for it. But that said, I wanted to mess around with it and see how close I could get

282
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:20,400
to his speech. And it's pretty crazy. Like it is crazy considering the

283
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:26,960
small amount of data that I trained it off of. Like, it was like a few files, maybe

284
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:34,880
less than five minutes, maybe two to three minutes long. That's it. I was able to do,

285
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:41,760
I trained mine off of just one minute of me talking just random stuff. I just was talking

286
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:48,240
like this and it's able to copy my voice. Scary. All right. Looking at some of the comments in

287
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:52,080
chat, cause you know, people have a lot to say on this. First off, Bobby Black Wolf found the

288
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:57,040
setting I was looking for in discord. If you, you know, evaluate what works for you and what doesn't,

289
00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:01,200
but it's in the user settings and there is a section called privacy and safety,

290
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:07,120
and that's where you can opt out or opt in or what have you to discord's systems with submitting the

291
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:14,000
information there. Other comments in chat, Zen Monkey 11 says, I hope the discord AI will give

292
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:22,720
me discord friends that like to answer back. Ouch, too real. Let's see. Fifth, no, it was

293
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:27,280
Mike Defton chat said both have green text. Sorry. It's hard for me to tell the difference

294
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:32,560
sometimes. Mike Defton chat says artificial only adapts to what it's being fed. And that was kind

295
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:39,120
of my point though, is that humanity is an extremely flawed creature. Like AI is always

296
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:45,520
going to be fed something with that's, that's a little off. That's just my only worry, you know,

297
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:49,360
and again, and although I completely understand what happened with the Seinfeld knockoff and

298
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:53,360
everything, and I get, I get the explanation of why it happened. It's just the whole,

299
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:58,800
like how it happened is still very, very, like, this is a flawed system. I don't know.

300
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:04,160
This is, this is interesting. And they also brought it back in it and they took out Jerry

301
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:10,400
and now it's just, it's, it's not really Jerry. It's some other dude that like blogs on his PC

302
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:14,880
or something like that. Like journals. It's like, I don't know. It sounds more Doogie Howser than

303
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:22,480
me, but like, um, yeah, apparently it's lost the magic now. Um, let's see. Looking at some other

304
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:27,840
chat. Uh, Mike Deaf says AI art is a problem. Uh, if it's dream says my argument, is it any

305
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:32,240
different from going to an art museum than coming home and painting something in the impressionist

306
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:39,600
style? Um, I think it also has a lot to do with maybe like the accuracy level of it because,

307
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:44,000
you know, when you come home and paint it yourself, let's be real. The computer does

308
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:50,480
a phenomenal job of getting it right. But like being influenced by art, that is something that

309
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:54,640
it happens in music. It happens in movies. It happens across all art. All art is influenced

310
00:27:54,640 --> 00:28:00,400
by other art essentially. Right. Like even this show. Sure. We were one of the first like

311
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:05,600
gaming podcasts, you know, that were available in iTunes or what have you, but you know,

312
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:11,680
a lot of people wonder like, Oh my God, you do a show for three hours. Yeah. That's because this

313
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:16,160
show was influenced not just by, you know, another internet radio show that I was working with for a

314
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:22,720
long time under station life, but in turn was influenced by over the air broadcast radio program

315
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:27,120
talk radio that would go for three hours at a time. That's a very common thing. A lot of

316
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:32,240
those programs are still going. So I am willing to admit, sure. There's a lot, but I like to think

317
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:37,360
this show is certainly not a copy of anything that was out there at the time. Just, you know,

318
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:43,120
influence. Right. Uh, Tiger class says, yeah, lots of stuff is derivative to other things.

319
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:49,280
Absolutely. Absolutely. Uh, Mike Defton chases, John Oliver did a good segment on how AI is

320
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:54,160
flawed. And that's why I said what I said. He does a lot of, uh, thought provoking stuff. So

321
00:28:54,160 --> 00:29:01,280
it's interesting anyway. All right. I, so this AI discussion, I, you know, where it is right. And

322
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:06,800
I'm not completely like completely like shut off to the idea of AI. And I think there is going to

323
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:16,080
be some interesting usage of AI, especially as we start to talk more about how do we get to 8k

324
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:22,560
graphics and 120 frame a second video games and all of the art that goes into that. I think the

325
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:27,840
reality is, cause it's already out there. There's going to be computer assisted art that may, you

326
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:34,720
know, we talk about uprising, some of that's done by hand, but a lot of it's done procedurally. So

327
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:39,440
I think there is going to be AI that starts to help out with art and things like that. And it's

328
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:44,720
going to be an inevitable future of this industry. It's just, it's just going to be interesting to

329
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:51,520
see where the flaws end up being. Well, yeah, too. I think also it'll help with the procedural

330
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:56,400
generated stuff because you could train it to like, okay, here's what's a good procedurally

331
00:29:56,400 --> 00:30:01,920
generated, whatever it is. And it'll be able to generate stuff and go, okay, I like that one. I

332
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:06,720
like that one. I like that one. And then, you know, put stuff out there. Yeah.

333
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:14,000
But yeah, I think, I think the AI talk is going to be here to stay in games. Unlike when we talk

334
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:20,080
about NFT and stuff like that, I think there's always going to be to efficiencies and getting

335
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:24,720
things done faster and bigger. I think we're going to hear more and more about it and it's going to

336
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:29,680
be very, very, very interesting to see what the future holds for this. I did want to mention

337
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:37,600
something that my kids were telling me about. So they were saying that they saw something about

338
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:46,240
that Roblox was going to have AI generative gains somehow. Not surprised. You tell it to

339
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:49,920
with the crate. I mean, I figured it's a lot of the stuff on there is trash anyways. Like

340
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:54,720
it'll probably be better than half the stuff that's on there already. If they can get their

341
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:59,040
money out of the bank, because did you hear that Roblox is one of the companies affected by that

342
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:03,040
whole bank stuff going on right now? Oh, that sucks for them.

343
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:07,280
That's, that's a whole other, that's another thing to keep your eye on. It doesn't,

344
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:12,000
it's not directly about video games, but there are gaming companies that certainly have holdings in

345
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,320
that bank. So it's interesting. Keep an eye on that. Could be, could be interesting to see how

346
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:23,840
that plays out. All right. Let's talk about not AI, but good old Loki and myself and eventually

347
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:28,720
Dark Sakura when she arrives after her other stream wraps up talking about our gaming weeks

348
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:32,640
and the types of video games that we have been playing this week. Loki, how was your gaming week?

349
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:40,720
It was still Minecraft. I was still working on the new area for my upcoming episode.

350
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:47,520
And it's taken me way too long to do that, but because I'm a perfectionist and I want everything

351
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:54,160
to look just right. But yeah, it's taking me a lot longer than I'd like, but that's probably going to

352
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:58,080
be a problem for the rest of the season, I'm guessing, because of the size of everything in

353
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:05,920
scope. But yeah, it's coming along, I think. And then, I don't know, I'm just still waiting on,

354
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:13,600
on the whole Minecraft contest thing, which I kind of looked at their past winners for different

355
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:20,080
things. And like, all they do on their website is they put like, here's like the picture of the

356
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:25,680
build that someone did in the person's username. They don't link out to socials, they don't link

357
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:30,400
out to anything. It's just a name. So that's like, literally going to do nothing. But hey,

358
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:34,880
it'll be cool. Still, it'll still be neat to just, you know, even have your name up there.

359
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:40,480
I'll be able to tweet about it. There we go. And then you can now you can add it to your

360
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:45,120
resume as seen on minecraft.net, or whatever, minecraft.com, whatever the website is.

361
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:50,720
That Yeah, better than nothing. So I, you know, I'm still rooting for you, you deserve the

362
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:54,880
acknowledgement of nothing else. It's, I think it's, I think it's in part, also, the fact that

363
00:32:54,880 --> 00:33:00,160
somebody on the official team noticed you, I think is a huge thing, too. Yeah, I think it'd be cool.

364
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:04,640
Like I always I always used to find it very humbling and flattering when people that were

365
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:10,720
in the gaming industry would email us sometimes on the record, sometimes off the record, and actually

366
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:16,000
give a little insight as to, you know, again, whether it be on or off the record, give a little

367
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,760
insight as to why a certain something something's going on in the gaming industry. By the way,

368
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:23,840
if you work in the industry, and you ever want to reach out, like, we know how to shut our mouths,

369
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:28,240
if you want to say something in confidence, but I'm always curious to hear people in the industry

370
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:31,840
and their thoughts on some of the things we talk about, especially because I know I've been running

371
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:36,240
my mouth a lot this year, with predictions and things like that. And I'd be very curious from

372
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:40,880
those that are in the industry, especially the takes on things like AI and stuff. I'm very

373
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:46,320
curious for those that are out there. All right, my gaming week, I've actually had a pretty active

374
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:52,640
gaming week. Alan, I don't think this came up on last week's show. Alan was sick, but he hadn't

375
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:57,520
tested positive for COVID yet. And that did happen, unfortunately, I think Monday morning. So maybe it

376
00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:03,040
was Tuesday. So we've just been home all week. I actually never got it. That's the very interesting,

377
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:08,800
weird thing how the world works sometimes. But I had it enough times last year, I don't need it

378
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:12,960
again. And he's doing much better. By the way, we're just basically waiting on the test to be

379
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:20,800
negative, but his symptoms are fine. And so we've we haven't really gone out and done anything

380
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:26,640
because we can't really, you know, I'm pretty much sick by association. So I've been staying

381
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:34,080
home and playing a lot of games. I have also been playing Minecraft. Dungeons. So it's one

382
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:39,920
of the free games on PlayStation Plus right now. And I don't know, I played it before on Windows

383
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:44,320
and I think even Xbox. But I was like, why not? I'll download it to my PlayStation five and start

384
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:49,280
playing it again. And for some reason, like I'm like more into it this time than the other times.

385
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:53,760
I don't know if it's that they've balanced things or it just seems like there's more to do with the

386
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:57,440
seasonal content, what have you. But like, yeah, I'm kind of feeling the Minecraft Dungeons right

387
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:03,280
now. So I haven't done anything that far beyond the first few stages. But check in with me again

388
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:07,040
next week. It's been it's been a fun thing to play. I like some things. It's, it's kind of

389
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:12,320
scratching the Diablo itch before Diablo four comes out. And I did play this latest Diablo three

390
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:17,680
season. But I don't know if I'm really motivated to like go as far as I have in previous Diablo

391
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:21,280
three seasons. Like I'm kind of like, I don't know, we'll see. I've just had a lot of other

392
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:26,800
stuff I've been wanting to play, including theater them still playing Final Fantasy theater them.

393
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:34,320
I've played over 300 unique songs at this point. I have not yet played every song at least once I

394
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:40,480
know that because that's a trophy but I'm working on that. I've gotten about between 15 and 20

395
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:46,560
characters to level 99. I wish I could say that's the max level but it's not because you get stars.

396
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:50,880
Basically every time you level to 99 after that, so you can get up to nine star 99.

397
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:57,600
So I still have some work to do in that regard. But that's been a lot of fun to play. I still

398
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:02,160
really love theater them. The world ends with you DLC comes out this week. So I'll be playing those

399
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:06,960
songs on Thursday stream. They come out Wednesday, but I can't stream Wednesday because I have a

400
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:13,040
IRL conflict, but I'll be playing that on Thursday. So there's that. What else have I been

401
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:16,400
playing? I've also still been playing Dead by Daylight. Some new DLC came out for that.

402
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:22,640
I got the adept on the new survivors. But otherwise, I worry a little bit about the

403
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:28,400
state of the game right now. I think with a lot of popular streamers, they're starting to look for

404
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:33,840
other things to play. I don't know if the game's getting stale. It needs a new license. I think the

405
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:40,960
actual game loop needs a real kick in the pants. But I'm going to spare you the details of that

406
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:43,920
talk because I know that's what dark soccer is playing right now. And she'll talk plenty more

407
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:49,440
about the game when she comes on later. Let's see other games I've been playing Final Fantasy 14

408
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:55,520
also got a minor patch this week. So I checked out Final Fantasy 14. Their new content in that

409
00:36:55,520 --> 00:37:01,680
is called Eureka Orthos, which is another type of deep dungeon. And what that is, that is a lol

410
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:06,640
procedurally generated dungeon. I don't know if I'd go so far to call it AI. I think it's just

411
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:11,680
very, very, I mean, I guess the end of the day, it's all AI. But it's very, very simple

412
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:17,040
programming that generates these very rudimentary dungeons, mazes, if you will, puts them together.

413
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:24,480
So you have basically like a random dungeon that you run every time. So it's kind of some

414
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:29,760
side content. It's a different way that you can level characters. This particular set allows you

415
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:34,880
to go from 81 to 90. And then there's other like cosmetic rewards. And there's, you know,

416
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:39,680
prestige, if you can clear the whole thing by yourself, because it's very difficult to solo,

417
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:47,680
it's notoriously difficult solo content. I believe Awesome Games Done Quick had

418
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:53,920
Palace of the Dead 180 to 190. They did that 10 floor segment of Palace of the Dead. That's what

419
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:59,760
this is. But it's like it's the Endwalker version of that because Palace of the Dead only ran up to

420
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:06,960
level 50. And then they had another one that went from, I think the Stormblood one, Heaven on High

421
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:14,800
went from 51 to 70. And they kind of skipped 70 to 80. They did completely different content as an

422
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:21,280
alternate 70 to 80 content. That was the Oh, God, what did they call that? It was an outside area

423
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:25,120
was it wasn't even a procedurally generated dungeon was like a whole other area that you

424
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:30,320
can level in. And now they're going back to this dungeon format for that. So Bojjan, that was the

425
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:38,080
name of it. Um, so yeah, I've been playing the Final Fantasy. And then what else? There's one

426
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:42,720
other one that was coming to mind and I'm not remembering in the moment. I guess it wasn't that

427
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:46,720
important. But I've still you know, been enjoying my PlayStation five, which is funny because I'm

428
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:52,000
not playing a lot of PS5 specific games on it. But I like the interface and I'm I'm ready for

429
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:57,120
Final Fantasy 16 whenever that comes out and whatever other PS5 treats might be waiting until

430
00:38:57,120 --> 00:39:01,280
then. I haven't really touched Returnal a lot since the first week I got it. That's too bad.

431
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:08,960
There's only only so much time to play games though. So all right, let's move on and get

432
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:13,600
into some of the gaming news that has happened this week throughout the industry. Oh, real quick

433
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:18,800
some plugs. Before I get to that, here at the voice of geeks network at twitch.tv slash vog

434
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:23,840
network, we had a bonus stream this week on Thursday night, where Captain Matt formerly

435
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:28,640
of the starboard power coupling, and formerly formerly a long time ago, he went by Grandpa

436
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:33,040
Warcraft on Horde house, we actually teamed up for a stream on Thursday night where we talked

437
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:39,040
all about Star Trek at the cruise. So that is available in our archives for subscribers to the

438
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:45,440
vog network stream over on Twitch. So we're going to try to bring back some more bonus streams over

439
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:49,840
the coming months to give more value to those you that go the extra mile with your subscription

440
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:56,320
here. We always like to say thank you. Our podcast will always be free and watching live always free.

441
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:03,760
It's really only the bonus video that we are asking for your Amazon prime free sub or if

442
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:09,920
you're feeling so kind of $5 a month on Amazon to access the subs and there are an awful lot of you

443
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:15,680
that do subscribe. So thank you. Thank you very much for that. That allows us to fund the business,

444
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:22,400
which I saw that we made a payment to the legal stuff this week and keeping that all running and

445
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:28,400
yep, your money goes right to that. So we appreciate it because that's less money out

446
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:33,440
of our pockets really. All right. Let's get into some more gaming news and what's going

447
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:36,080
on throughout the industry. So we'll go over to you, Loki.

448
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:41,680
We will see like a music for this or music and like transition for this segment. It's

449
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:49,120
talking about the Activision acquisition by Microsoft and the ongoing saga that is.

450
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:57,360
Well, so a few more things. So we've got some more insight on how the negotiations are going.

451
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:05,840
So apparently coming from Lulu Chang, Missouri, from Activision, saying that Microsoft offered

452
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:12,400
Sony a 10-year agreement on the far better terms than Sony would ever get from us.

453
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:18,720
We also offered Sony a guaranteed long-term access to Call of Duty, but they kept refusing.

454
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:28,160
Why? And she said that in the CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment, in his words, said,

455
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:31,920
I don't want a new Call of Duty deal. I just want to block your merger.

456
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,440
So that statement's going to come back to bite.

457
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,480
That's that's drama.

458
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:43,520
Well, Microsoft can now like basically prove that they've tried to do things in good faith

459
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:51,440
and Sony's shut them down. I think there's definitely a drunk with power thing going on

460
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:57,040
with Sony. But the more I really step back and think about it, the more I really do realize

461
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:04,480
Call of Duty really has been something that's put Sony forward in a lot of the E3s of yesteryear

462
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:11,680
and so forth. Sony has been enjoying being number one in the race for some time. Well,

463
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:16,880
I don't know if they're always number one against Nintendo and maybe in the Xbox 360 era,

464
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:20,640
Microsoft was ahead for a little bit, but Sony inevitably caught up with PS3

465
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:25,040
and certainly worldwide they did. So I can see where this threatens them a little bit, but

466
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,880
Sony kind of needs the competition.

467
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:34,240
Well, they're also like kind of, I don't know what, here's some of the ridiculous

468
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:38,720
stuff that they're spouting to try to block this merger. So a new document submitted to

469
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:45,680
the UK's Competition and Markets Authority, Sony laid out hypothetical ways in which Microsoft

470
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:52,560
could circumvent the proposed 10 year deal in its offering to PlayStation. They said Microsoft might

471
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:57,600
release a PlayStation version of Call of Duty, where bugs and errors emerge only on the game's

472
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:04,400
final level or later updates. Even if such degradations can be swiftly detected, any remedy

473
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:09,200
would likely come too late, by which the time of the gaming community would have lost confidence

474
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:15,840
in PlayStation as the go to venue to play Call of Duty. Indeed, as modern warfare to attest,

475
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:21,200
Call of Duty is the most often purchased in just a few weeks of release. It has become known that

476
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:25,920
the game's performance on PlayStation was worse than Xbox. Call of Duty gamers could decide to

477
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:31,360
switch to Xbox for fear of playing their favorite game on a second class or less competitive venue.

478
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:38,880
That is so hypothetically ridiculous that it's just, it's just stupid. That's just a stupid

479
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:43,920
thing to say. And I don't know why they said it. I mean, they have to try to come up with a reason,

480
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:48,880
but that's just stupid. Like, yes, they're going to purposely put out a game with bugs

481
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:56,960
on purpose because they don't want to sell copies of the game. Like that doesn't make

482
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:03,840
any sense that they would do that. I just. I mean, Microsoft did just buy a company not

483
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:08,000
that long ago that's really good about putting out retail releases with bugs still in them.

484
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:16,160
So that's true that that game did run poorly on the PlayStation three. But I mean, it's just,

485
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:24,800
that's just stupid and silly to me. Like, I'm sorry. First off, like, you're assuming that

486
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:29,920
gamers are going to be smart. Like they're going to just go, Oh, well, it's the PlayStation. That's

487
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:36,000
why this isn't working. Not like, Oh, it's Activision putting out like shitty buggy games.

488
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:41,600
Like, I just think it's whatever. You know what? It's a strategy that they're trying. But like,

489
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:46,320
I think with this kind of nonsense that they're spouting on top of like the other stuff,

490
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:51,920
I don't know if they're going to side with Sony. I do just want to point out, I've been playing

491
00:44:52,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Minecraft dungeons this week on my PlayStation. And it is very interesting seeing the Xbox Game

492
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,480
Studios logo pop up when you start the game because you know, that's the thing, right?

493
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:08,800
So you actually see the Xbox logo and I'm sure that MLB Oh, no, that was the other way around,

494
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:15,040
right? MLB The show was the PlayStation logo on an Xbox. So Oh, yeah, does that does that like have

495
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:20,880
did they make a crappy version of the game on the on the Xbox one or the Xbox Series S or whatever?

496
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:26,400
Because to get people to come play it on the PlayStation? No, that's stupid. It's a stupid

497
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:31,120
assessment. Why would they Why would you go through the process of making games like Oh,

498
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:36,720
but hey, you know, we're gonna we're gonna make this version crappy. You know who did that,

499
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:42,000
though? You know who made a crappier version of the game because of a certain company?

500
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:49,920
Sony did actually because you had locked away Spider Man from the Marvel Avengers game that

501
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:54,640
it couldn't be on other platforms because you decided to get your assholes and you want to keep

502
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:55,680
Spider Man to yourself.

503
00:45:55,680 --> 00:46:01,040
I was just about to say I don't see Microsoft releasing a buggy version. But I see them

504
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:09,040
releasing a version where Oh, but the new map and the new DLC comes to Microsoft first for six weeks

505
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:14,160
before it comes to other platforms. Oh, and that whole thing, which by the way, has been Sony's

506
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:19,920
playbook specifically with Call of Duty for a very long time. And I'm afraid of literally of

507
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:26,240
getting a taste of their own medicine. I guarantee if if this were to fit, like for some reason,

508
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:32,480
this merger is not allowed to go through. And they decide that they're not going to purchase

509
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:37,680
the company anymore. I guarantee that they're going to try to that Sony is going to try to

510
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:42,080
purchase them. I guarantee it and all of this shit that they're talking about that it's going

511
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:48,480
to happen. It'll be the things that they do. Yeah, like is just yeah, they know that this is

512
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:55,280
going to be a possibility because this is their playbook right here. I don't know. But now,

513
00:46:55,280 --> 00:47:00,240
granted, this is we're only seeing part of it. A lot of the information has been redacted from

514
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:06,000
Sony in regards to the stuff that's been leaked out. So or not leaked out, released, I guess,

515
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:12,480
to the public from these court filings. And there are, you know, obviously, the CMA

516
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:17,440
and other regulatory bodies have more information about this than we do. So hopefully, there's

517
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:21,520
people intelligent enough to know that this is going to be ridiculous. I think that they're be

518
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:25,920
they're making good faith efforts. Yeah, like, I get it. Like, 10 years, they're not going to

519
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:31,840
guarantee that Call of Duty is always going to be on the PlayStation. I mean, of course not.

520
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:35,760
But 10 years, I mean, that's like two console cycles right there. Like, come on.

521
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:42,640
DJ Rama S in chat says, when Microsoft fully acquires ABK, I expect a shift in console sales

522
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:48,400
in favor of Microsoft. I don't, at least not right out the gate. I think you're going to need to

523
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:52,400
start to look at the next console generation before you're really going to see the fruits of

524
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:58,560
that whole thing. But at this point, I and again, especially since they're committing to these

525
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:02,320
deals, they're willing to commit to the Sony deal, which I think they're even if Sony is

526
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:08,400
holding out on, I think they're going to have to eventually kind of make sure that still happens.

527
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:12,960
I feel like it's not going to matter for this, but it might matter in the future.

528
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:19,120
It'll be interesting. It'll be interesting to see. By the way, I have breaking news.

529
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:27,280
I was just handed this COVID test by Alan and it's negative. So Alan is now COVID free. Yay.

530
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:32,560
Hey, it's important to me. Okay. Because we've been stuck here all week.

531
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:40,640
All right. Let's move on. Let's talk about a recent game remake that got a lot of folks

532
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:47,600
attention. Thank you for the yays in chat. I appreciate it. We got a Chrono Cross remake

533
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:53,760
that happened not that long ago, which wasn't super well received because it has some frame

534
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:58,000
rate problems and a game that was running on the fucking PlayStation one shouldn't be having frame

535
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:04,800
rate problems, but that's, you know, it's gaming. But what's interesting in making the rounds this

536
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:09,360
week is a new YouTube interview with the development team behind Chrono Cross, the

537
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:16,320
Radical Dreamers edition. This is to recognize the game's 20th anniversary. The game's anniversary

538
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:20,720
was in 2019 and that's why this game was released. And they were kind of just, you know,

539
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:25,520
reflecting on the release of the game. And producer Kochiro Sakamoto said back when the

540
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:31,120
project was launched, Chrono Cross was possibly going to become unplayable. There was a game

541
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:36,480
archive service on PlayStation three that allowed you to play PlayStation one games, but PlayStation

542
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:40,960
four was already on the market. We didn't know at the time of PlayStation four would also have a

543
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:47,680
game archive service. It looked like Chrono Cross could become unplayable. So a remaster project was

544
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:54,800
set up. That's the backstory. So it's interesting that the whole reason this release happened was

545
00:49:54,800 --> 00:50:00,320
because they didn't trust Sony to do the backwards compatibility on PlayStation four.

546
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:06,080
Now, of course, now that we're on PlayStation five, we know that PlayStation one games do make

547
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:09,600
their way to the catalog. In fact, I think they've been adding trophy support and things like that to

548
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:16,080
those games. Uh, but you know, either way we have the Radical Dreamers edition for better or for

549
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:21,440
worse. Um, because again, it had some frame rate issues, but I think they, I want to say, I heard

550
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:25,840
they did a patch not that long ago to try to address some of the issues. So it's interesting.

551
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:32,240
They're still working on it. Kind of interesting. So, uh, yeah. Bobby Blackall points out they

552
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:37,600
patched it. That's what I thought I had heard recently. That's for sure. So, um, yeah. Uh,

553
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:42,160
Dark Titsui also says I've been meaning to get that one. Yeah. I think they're, uh, you know,

554
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:46,720
if they're, they're always willing to make another sale with that, that's for sure.

555
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:54,320
So, all right. Um, let's, before we move on to the next story, I think I'm able to welcome to

556
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:59,680
the show question mark. Cause I noticed that they just joined discord. I think, do we have a Dark

557
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:05,760
Sakura? Not yet. Not yet. Okay. Well, we'll wait a couple more stories and then bring you in. All

558
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:10,880
right. I just wanted to go ahead and pop in, but I need to give my voice a rest for a few. Yeah. No

559
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:14,880
worries. No worries. We'll come back. Just turn your camera on when you're ready. All right. Let's

560
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:22,880
move on to, uh, the next story. Loki. All right. So, uh, Fortnite chapter four

561
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:29,280
season two is now live and they've added some new changes to the maps. Of course. Uh, this one now

562
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:37,200
has a giant mega city, uh, which is kind of like a cyberpunk inspired locale. They've got lots of

563
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:44,000
rails that you can grind on now. Uh, two person motorcycle, the victory, victory crown rogue,

564
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:50,160
a, uh, four person car called the nitro drifter. They have this really cool sword. Now they can

565
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:56,960
kill people with a katana called a kinetic blade. Uh, some new assault rifles, shotgun. Um,

566
00:51:57,840 --> 00:52:02,640
they have new battle pass skins as well. So, uh, the one I thought was pretty awesome is

567
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:09,360
Aaron Yeager from attack on Titan, including his omni-directional mobility gear, which is awesome.

568
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:16,800
Uh, that looks pretty fun and, um, yeah, lots of, um, interesting things. Still don't want

569
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:22,400
to play the game, but it looks cool for those who are playing it though. Just not my thing.

570
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:27,120
Yeah. Not so Alan's trying to get me to do it though. He wants to do like a co stream where

571
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:34,240
he teaches stuff is really appealing to me. Yeah. And it might be like, you know,

572
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:41,120
cause I remember, I remember there was a time when like Minecraft, I was like, I just don't

573
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:47,040
get that game. I will get the appeal for that. Oh, okay. Yeah. I don't think I'd be like that

574
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:51,600
with Fortnite, but there was a time when mass effect, when I was like, I don't get it. There's

575
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:56,640
it's it happens. It happens. I mean, it looks, it looks okay. I just, I don't know. I'm not

576
00:52:56,720 --> 00:53:02,240
like, I've been so out of shooters nowadays. It feels like, you know, to come into something

577
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:07,200
like that, you know, without it being like launch date of a new IP or something like that. It just

578
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:12,640
feels like you'd be at a massive disadvantage, but I don't understand why Fortnite removes

579
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:18,000
things from the store. Like, and brings them back only like one day out of the year because

580
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:26,080
like I would play for a night. I get that science behind it, but let it go on record. Epic games.

581
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:32,160
If you're out there listening, Tim Sweeney, if you're out there listening, no, I will not be

582
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:39,920
playing Fortnite until I can purchase the Ariana Grande skin. Just know that you want to make this

583
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:45,520
sale. Let me, let me buy the Ariana Grande skin. That's all I ask. I'm not asking for a lot.

584
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:54,080
Anyway, let's talk about a company that was giving us a lot this week. Capcom

585
00:53:54,080 --> 00:54:00,480
had a whole little spotlight presentation. So it's called the Capcom Spotlight 2023. And they

586
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:05,120
showed quite a few things this Thursday. They had a little presentation, their own kind of direct of

587
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:11,040
sorts. And they talked about Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection. This, of course,

588
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:15,920
is all of the Battle Network games. I think we had known about this before. We didn't know the date.

589
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:21,760
It's coming out on April 14th is the date for PC, Switch, and PlayStation 4.

590
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:25,200
Which is one of those Nintendo Directs that they showed that I remember.

591
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:28,880
Yeah, yeah, they had originally unveiled it in a Nintendo Direct. So but now we have the date

592
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:33,680
and everything. So they showed that. Oh, Mike Deff says we already had known the date. Oh,

593
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:37,600
I didn't know that. Well, now we know it's PC and PS4. I don't know. They showed it anyway.

594
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:46,880
We also had a, they were talking about some of the gameplay features. 499 patch cards. They were

595
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:52,240
only available as physical cards, and a Buster Max mode. Those are all going to be in the game.

596
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:56,880
So I guess that information is also new. They hadn't talked about that in the Direct and so

597
00:54:56,880 --> 00:55:06,080
forth. If you're a Mega Man fan, the Mega Man NT Warrior series will be streaming free on March 21st

598
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:12,400
if you want to check that out. Street Fighter 6, they didn't really mention any new fighters or

599
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:14,960
anything like that. Because last time they unveiled fighters, they unveiled a lot if I

600
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:21,680
remember right. But actress Hikaru Takahashi will be one of the commentators for the special

601
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:26,560
commentary feature. So that sounds like a whole interesting feature of the game. So they did

602
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:33,360
announce that. Also, Capcom Town will be coming out for Capcom's 40th anniversary. It is a digital

603
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:39,200
theme park and museum of Capcom's histories. You have to make a Capcom ID in order to see this.

604
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:42,960
This is not like an actual game. I think it's just like a website or something like that.

605
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:49,680
So there is that. Mike Deff says that the full roster were already out for the game,

606
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:54,240
that the last three were in the state of play from Sony. Well, the full roster was spilled like a

607
00:55:54,240 --> 00:56:00,320
year ago, wasn't it? So there is that too. So sorry if I haven't been keeping track of each

608
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:06,880
one, but thank you for the update. Exo Primal Dinosaur Shooting Game will be coming out with

609
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:15,040
an open beta on March 17th and a full release on July 14th. Also, it is a day one Xbox Game Pass

610
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:21,600
title. So if you're only kind of curious about it, then you can try that. But of course, as I notice

611
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:28,400
more Game Pass games are tending to do, there's a season pass with Exo Primals with tracks and

612
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:33,680
pre-order bonuses and so forth. So yeah, if that's something that sounds like you want to spend money

613
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:40,400
on it, cool. Ghost Trick Phantom Detective is getting a remaster for Modern Systems and it will

614
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:46,720
be released on June 30th. Again, it's updated visuals and some gallery features in it as well.

615
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:53,280
Some new arrangements from Yasumasa Kitagawa, the great Ace Attorney composer, and you can swap back

616
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:59,760
and forth with the original music as well. So that's pretty neat. Monster Hunter Rise Sunbreak

617
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:06,080
will be coming out April 28th for Xbox and PlayStation, so that's cool if you want to

618
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:15,520
check that out. Resident Evil Death Island got a new trailer released. This is a CGI

619
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:22,800
animation and Jill Valentine is featured in that. And then lastly, a Resident Evil 4 demo was

620
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:28,560
released that day. That was the big news. The Resident Evil 4 demo came out now. It's called

621
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:36,160
the Chainsaw demo and you can see how the gameplay is on PlayStation, Xbox Series, and PC, and a lot

622
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:41,520
of people were picking that right up and streaming that and playing that and experiencing all those

623
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:48,720
scares all over again. So that was all the stuff that came out with the Capcom spotlight this week.

624
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:56,640
Not Capcom, but like sorely tangentially related. They also released a gameplay, like in-depth

625
00:57:56,720 --> 00:58:02,880
gameplay thing for Dead Island 2, and it looks good. It looks really good. You can see where I

626
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:10,000
have concerns, but okay. Hey, if it's good, I'm excited. It looks good. Like, it really does look good.

627
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:17,360
We'll see. All right. All right, let's move on to our next story.

628
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:25,280
Actually, before I do that, I see Dark Soccer's got her camera on, so let me officially welcome

629
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:31,680
to the show Dark Sakura and her cat that you can see live here on Twitch, Ms. Middles. Hi!

630
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:37,440
And you're muted on Discord. Is this your first time? No, I'm just kidding.

631
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:42,880
I know you've had a long day. Hi, how are you? I'm all right. How are you? Good. How are the games

632
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:48,880
that you were playing just a minute ago? The games were pretty good. We had some nice

633
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:53,200
killers and we had some stinky killers, but I had fun playing with everybody and it was a fun

634
00:58:53,280 --> 00:59:01,680
challenge to go into a match with no perks. Interesting. So, I was going to ask if you wanted

635
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:05,840
to catch us up a little bit on how was your gaming week? I mean, I guess we're talking a little bit

636
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:08,800
about your Dead by Daylight stuff, but I don't know if there's other things you want to share too?

637
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:16,240
I got my new controller, my SteelSeries Nimbus Plus, but for some reason, my SNES

638
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:22,080
simulator doesn't like it. So, I wasn't able to play Star Ocean, so I've been playing

639
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:26,080
Marvel's Midnight Suns on stream instead. Well, that's okay. Fair trade.

640
00:59:26,080 --> 00:59:31,520
And my words hate some little cults of the land and some Beatles pinball because I actually really

641
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:40,080
love it even though it hates me. And of course, Dead by Daylight. I'm eerie one and we have a

642
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:45,520
rank reset tomorrow, but I need to start putting love back into my killers. So, I might do that

643
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:50,400
tonight. We'll see. What do you think of that? Because the new killer and survivors officially

644
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:56,000
came out. So, how are you feeling about Kris Jenner? That's the joke. If you don't follow

645
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:02,000
the Dead by Daylight memes, the new killer looks like Kris Jenner wearing a mask from Keeping Up

646
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:07,360
with the Kardashians. Kris Jenner with a mask and a big claw that she uses. And she's kind of a

647
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:15,520
sugar mommy too. So, the Kris Jenner lore is really funny to me. I mean, the thing about it

648
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:24,240
is that I don't like her animation because apparently when they animated her skeleton,

649
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:30,080
they didn't pay attention to how people actually walk. And then when she gets, you know,

650
01:00:30,080 --> 01:00:35,920
teared up for bloodlust and gets the speed on, it looks really bizarre with the way that her

651
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:41,120
hips are animated. People do not walk like that. She struts her stuff as she walks.

652
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:47,280
Well, we were talking about it when I was playing with Tony Low and Rokums and Potato King.

653
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:52,240
And they're like, oh, she's supposed to be like the sexy serpent type. And I'm like,

654
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:57,280
and they're like, oh, hips don't lie. I'm like, no, her lips are full of lies. They are full

655
01:00:57,280 --> 01:01:01,680
of falsehoods because they don't move that way. It just, it all lends itself to the rumor that

656
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:05,200
that whole pack was originally supposed to be the predator. Like, it's just, it's like,

657
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:10,320
it's animated like the predator. And some people are actually saying that, no,

658
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:15,280
that wasn't a predator license that got lost that I don't think they pursued it.

659
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:27,920
But no, she, we had one match with her and people are not using her, I think to her potential. So

660
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:32,960
of course I'm going to have to learn how to play her when I have to go for my adepts,

661
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:38,720
but I now have all of my survivor adepts. We did like a palette cleanser game, a palette,

662
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:44,960
palette cleanser game after we were done. And I decided to try to adapt Renato, although he's like

663
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:49,280
really loud, like really loud, like Leon levels of loud.

664
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:55,600
And I got the adept because a very nice trapper took me to the hatch.

665
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:57,280
Oh, nice.

666
01:01:58,080 --> 01:02:00,480
So I now have all of my survivor adepts.

667
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:06,000
I got the survivor adepts of the two new ones as well. But funny enough, my Renato was also,

668
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:10,240
it wasn't a hatch, but it was a killer who gave up partway through the game and did the whole,

669
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:13,920
nope, I'm looking away. I'm just going to watch you walk out the door and that whole thing.

670
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:16,480
Like I got mine from a give up killer.

671
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:22,240
So that's what our first match was kind of like. And I'm actually our first match was a farmer

672
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:24,880
who actually came in and said, this is what I need. Will you help me?

673
01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:29,520
At least they're honest. At least they're honest. Yeah.

674
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:30,020
All right.

675
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:33,200
So all right.

676
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:34,160
Sorry, she's making noise.

677
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:37,200
Well, good. I'm glad you're in the back corner of my camera.

678
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:39,200
I'm glad the stream was a success.

679
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:42,640
I hope you were able to plug OLR to a whole new audience.

680
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:44,320
I did actually.

681
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:48,640
When we introduced ourselves, I said that immediately afterwards would be podcasting.

682
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:55,520
And I was like, after the Palette Cleanser match, I have to go. I've got to do OLR.

683
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:59,600
But 21 years, we got to keep going at it.

684
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:05,440
Well, welcome and hello to anyone that might have come in from all that debauchery and fun and

685
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:11,760
merriment. So all right. We have we have a whole segment for Dark Soccer coming up in just a

686
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:16,400
moment. But before we get there, we have just a couple of other stories. So let's get into this

687
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:20,240
one, which ironically also has to do with classic games a little bit, right, Loki?

688
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:28,080
Yeah, a little bit. So this is a little bit of speculation. Just, you know, some, you know,

689
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:34,480
thoughts, I guess, thinking about the new potential switch hardware. And so there was

690
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:41,840
a video put out by Modern Vintage Gamer, who also is a creator and developer at Nightdive Studios,

691
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:45,840
talking about, you know, some of the hurdles that they would have to cross

692
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:52,400
working with new switch hardware that would be running on something other than the Tegra X1 chip,

693
01:03:52,720 --> 01:03:59,280
basically saying that, you know, there's going to be some problems with backwards compatibility,

694
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:04,400
which, you know, a lot of folks are assuming that it's going to be backwards compatible

695
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:12,560
with switch games, this new console, whatever. But because the way the games work and how they

696
01:04:12,560 --> 01:04:19,120
have all the pre compiled shaders and everything included with the games, that it may not be able,

697
01:04:19,120 --> 01:04:24,080
you may not be able to port that stuff over because those chips sets won't be compatible

698
01:04:24,080 --> 01:04:29,360
with each other. And it'll essentially require the game to be recompiled for that new chipset.

699
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:36,800
And that, you know, unfortunately, that the hardware is probably not going to be powerful

700
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:42,400
enough to run emulation for it. They're comparing to like, say, the Steam Deck, you know, which

701
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:48,880
struggles to run switch games emulated. But I mean, if it's more powerful than that,

702
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:55,840
maybe it could do it, but I don't see Nintendo doing that. But yeah, it's it's interesting to

703
01:04:55,840 --> 01:05:00,400
see, you know, what they're going to do with that. I wouldn't be surprised if it's not compatible

704
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:05,920
with switch games. Nintendo hasn't shied away from backwards compatibility, especially in these,

705
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:10,560
like, you know, we were talking like the Wii U, I mean, I guess the Wii U, the Wii,

706
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:17,120
that was Yeah, yeah. And the Wii would play GameCube. So I mean, yeah, I mean, so they tried,

707
01:05:17,120 --> 01:05:23,840
but I don't know if it's can be done here. Like, maybe be a lot of those systems. So like,

708
01:05:23,840 --> 01:05:28,160
especially when we're talking the Wii U and the Wii, I don't think the Wii U is playing.

709
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:36,160
I think that also may have had this chip sets from the Wii inside of the Wii U as well. I know that

710
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:39,920
like the Wii had GameCube hardware. I was gonna say, wasn't the running gag about the Wii is

711
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:46,800
that it was two GameCubes duct taped together? Yes, that's very true. Um, so I don't know,

712
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:50,880
I think this is gonna be a problem that we'll just have to wait and see what happens with this.

713
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:57,120
But you mean, just don't count on anything and you won't be disappointed, I guess. I guess but,

714
01:05:57,120 --> 01:06:03,120
you know, also, it would be very disappointing if it wasn't somehow backwards compatible,

715
01:06:03,120 --> 01:06:06,880
especially considering how much of a digital library a lot of people are building themselves

716
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:11,600
at this point, right? Like, you know, even if it has to do with the new system can't handle

717
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:16,480
the cartridge or whatever silly thing it is, like, at least let the digital end of it be

718
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:21,040
backwards compatible, my god. And then I also wonder, like, if they do go to a new system,

719
01:06:21,040 --> 01:06:26,960
what are they going to do in the place of the Nintendo online? And are they going to go back to

720
01:06:28,080 --> 01:06:32,880
diving for games? Because that seemed to be more popular. So I can see them still moving the

721
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:37,440
Nintendo online stuff over because a lot of that stuff is just emulating old consoles, which

722
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:44,000
that any hardware should be able to handle. It's just I think the actual games themselves,

723
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:49,520
the Switch games are going to be a little bit trickier, but we'll see what they end up putting

724
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:54,480
in there. It also, you know, one of the things I see them like talking about like the Tegra X1

725
01:06:54,480 --> 01:07:00,480
chips and stuff. I mean, who's to say they couldn't like put an X1 chip in there and then

726
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:05,760
something else on top of that? Like, I don't know what cost wise that would do for the console,

727
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:10,160
but like, it's not possible for them to have two different chips.

728
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:14,000
Fucking cloud streaming. That's what everyone, even on Nintendo's own system,

729
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:17,760
a lot of developers are turning to that, you know, with control and,

730
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:19,520
you know, some of the other games doing that.

731
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:21,280
So they can't run anything.

732
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:27,120
Yeah, be very interesting. So let's see, as Joe and Hunter Matt points out,

733
01:07:27,120 --> 01:07:32,400
Microsoft's made it work well. Yeah, you know, and Microsoft was one of those companies where,

734
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:36,240
you know, remember when they shied away from backwards compatibility and they got raked

735
01:07:36,240 --> 01:07:40,080
through the coals for it? Well, they really caught up and they've done a really good job,

736
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:44,000
you know, catching up. Not every single game is backwards compatible, but you know, because

737
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:49,520
obviously I still miss the old DDR games, but there is that. Yeah. Mike Deaf says,

738
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:53,440
yeah, it's surprising that Microsoft is leading the way for retro compatibility.

739
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:57,120
Not when you look at who's the head of the company, to be honest. I think, you know,

740
01:07:57,120 --> 01:08:03,040
he's been a gamer more than some of the executives at other companies. And it's just kind of goes to

741
01:08:03,040 --> 01:08:12,400
show that. So let's see. Yeah. Looking for some other comments over twitch.tv slash fog network,

742
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:19,840
again, where we do tape live every Sunday night. I find it interesting that this almost like this,

743
01:08:19,840 --> 01:08:24,720
this whole talk about the backwards compatibility, it almost cements the fact that there's not going

744
01:08:24,720 --> 01:08:28,800
to be a switch pro anymore. Like I think a lot of us were just assuming there was going to be a

745
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:35,360
super switch, or the next switch or the next console would be a switch, but more. But now it's

746
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:39,600
going to be very interesting to see what does happen next, because I sort of thought the switch

747
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:45,280
model was really working for Nintendo. Do you see Nintendo shying away from the whole, you're

748
01:08:45,280 --> 01:08:48,960
playing it handheld, you're playing it on the TV, you're playing a handheld, you're playing it on

749
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:55,440
TV? Well, I don't see how Nintendo gets away from that at this point. No, I don't think that they

750
01:08:55,440 --> 01:08:59,920
would do that. I mean, considering they even have some models that don't connect to the TV at all.

751
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:04,880
So they're definitely embracing like the portableness of it. Certainly, I think they

752
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:11,440
could do more to like try to increase the hardware specs in it. I mean, the very least get something

753
01:09:11,440 --> 01:09:18,720
that's kind of comparable to say, the Steam Deck, you know, something like that. But yeah, it would

754
01:09:18,720 --> 01:09:25,120
be kind of hard for them to move away from it. But at the same time, like, would I be that

755
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:32,640
disappointed? Maybe I guess my kids like playing it. They may mostly play it handheld anyways, but

756
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:39,760
I don't know. Personally, me, I wouldn't care. I wouldn't care if they did something completely

757
01:09:39,760 --> 01:09:47,440
different, but I get it. Yeah. All right. Well, in this next story, we are talking about a very

758
01:09:47,440 --> 01:09:53,680
unlikely partnership of sorts. And that has to do with Diablo 4, which you know, is still on deck

759
01:09:53,680 --> 01:10:01,840
to come out this June. And KFC. Yeah, Blizzard is teaming up with KFC to help you get into the

760
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:07,200
upcoming beta for Diablo 4 on PC and console. Now I want to point out there's multiple ways to get

761
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:13,520
into this beta, you could just buy the Uber edition for like $100, which I may have done

762
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:19,520
and get your way into the beta that way. But if that doesn't sound appetizing to you, well,

763
01:10:20,240 --> 01:10:25,360
you can go get a Double Down sandwich. And I use that term sandwich loosely when it comes to this.

764
01:10:25,360 --> 01:10:32,160
You can go get a Double Down on the toilet, a food product from KFC or the delivery app.

765
01:10:32,160 --> 01:10:38,240
I think it's interesting. You have to get it from KFC.com or the delivery app. However,

766
01:10:38,240 --> 01:10:42,000
you don't have to actually eat it if you don't want to. You just have to pay the money for one.

767
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:46,960
Buying the sandwich will give you a code and you put that in your Battle.net account and you will

768
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:53,680
be able to get into the beta, which is next weekend, March 17th through March 20th. Apparently,

769
01:10:53,680 --> 01:10:59,440
this is only available in the US, not available in Canada, because I don't think the Double Down

770
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:05,440
is available in Canada yet. So or I'm sure it has something to do with regions and like, yeah.

771
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:08,240
Yeah.

772
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:15,760
No, the Double Down on paper sounded like a good thing. Like I tried it back when they first had

773
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:20,480
it and it was a disappointment. It's not very good. Like the sauce that they put on it, not

774
01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:27,920
very good. I like KFC, but like, nah, it's just it's it's all gimmick. It really is.

775
01:11:28,640 --> 01:11:34,080
Quest Buster says Diablo 4 with 11 herbs and spices. It's, you know, the partnership with

776
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:38,560
Diablo 4 is because when you eat a Double Down sandwich, you are going to experience hell,

777
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:42,080
flying out of your butthole and lighting sweet.

778
01:11:42,080 --> 01:11:49,040
Honestly, they should have partnered with Dave's Hot Chicken, which I think has a Diablo

779
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:55,680
heat level. They may be called Inferno, but like, you should order one of those where it literally

780
01:11:55,680 --> 01:12:01,760
will burn your ass off like if you eat it. That would have been like, really, that would have

781
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:06,320
made more sense than KFC. KFC and the Double Down. That's stupid.

782
01:12:07,040 --> 01:12:13,200
Oh, God. All right. Well, for those of you that are going to participate in getting a Double Down

783
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:18,960
to get yourself a Beta Key, I salute you. And maybe maybe this will lead to a whole new toilet

784
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:25,600
paper shortage across America. We'll see. All right. Let's let's go back to a simpler time.

785
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:33,440
When at KFC, you got chicken while you enjoyed a classic video game. Let's get to the segment.

786
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:49,440
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull

787
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:54,320
out a classic and tell you about it. It's time for the classic game of the week.

788
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,800
And what did you pick for us this week, Dar Sakura?

789
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:08,080
I picked Balls with a Z. So not to be confused with a more current mobile game. So it is a 2.5D

790
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:15,040
action fighting game that came out for the Sega Genesis slash Mega Drive and the Super NES and

791
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:22,240
the 3DO. It was developed by a company called PF Magic, published by Accolade, and it came out

792
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:29,680
in 1994. The 3DO version is a director's cut that came out in 1995. It has three difficulty levels

793
01:13:29,680 --> 01:13:39,440
and you can play 21 matches. And it's unique because the characters are just literally made

794
01:13:39,440 --> 01:13:48,000
out of balls. Balls. She said balls. And the game really wasn't super successful,

795
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:54,880
but PF Magic used that technology to make some virtual pet titles like Pets, Dogs, Cats, and

796
01:13:54,880 --> 01:14:08,560
Oddballs, all with a Z. It basically was proposed by someone named Keith Kirby to use the balls

797
01:14:09,280 --> 01:14:14,320
as the characters. And so they implemented the idea to save processing power. And then the fact

798
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:20,320
that no matter where the in-game camera, where the camera would be as they positioned it for

799
01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:28,400
the characters, that they would look the same from all angles because balls. The Mega Drive

800
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:34,080
one was supposed to use the Edge 16, which is a modem system for multiplayer, but that was

801
01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:42,800
canceled. And of course, it's opening statement for the game on the Mega Drive was to be the

802
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:48,320
champion, you gotta have balls. I know, mature. But because of the double entendre,

803
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:53,440
Nintendo was like, no, you can't use that. So it was changed to you gotta play balls.

804
01:14:55,520 --> 01:15:01,680
So as far as your characters went, you had a few interesting ones.

805
01:15:03,920 --> 01:15:08,960
The main characters were Boomer, which was a clown, Bruiser, which was a bodybuilder,

806
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:16,000
Crusher, that was a rhinoceros, Divine, a ballerina dancer and not, you know, the drag queen,

807
01:15:17,360 --> 01:15:21,680
Kronk, who's a caveman, Tsunami, who is a sumo,

808
01:15:24,240 --> 01:15:31,280
Turbo, who is a superhero, that's the only one with ranged attacks, Yoko the monkey. And only

809
01:15:31,280 --> 01:15:36,240
in the 3DO version, which was the director's cut, you get a character named Zombie. As for the

810
01:15:36,240 --> 01:15:45,120
bosses, you have Guggler, which is an ostrich, Bounder, that is a kangaroo, T-Rex, W-R-E-C-K-S,

811
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:55,120
that's a dinosaur, Lamprey, which is a genie, and the Jester, which is the one that issued

812
01:15:55,120 --> 01:16:00,480
the challenge and he is the ultimate boss. The game got really mediocre reviews.

813
01:16:01,440 --> 01:16:07,840
EGM said the fighters are interesting, their taunts were funny, the whole idea is very

814
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:14,640
innovative, but at the end, it was just really bland. I mean, people thought that it was,

815
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:18,800
you know, it was a good concept. People liked it, but most of the people are just like,

816
01:16:20,160 --> 01:16:27,120
it's just the whole thing together didn't come together very well. But it was praised for its

817
01:16:27,120 --> 01:16:33,680
graphics, its design, and some of its sound design, but the moves were way too limited to

818
01:16:33,680 --> 01:16:40,400
keep it interesting. It was ranked seventh on the 2011 list of top 10 fighting games we'd like to

819
01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:51,280
forget by Game Informer. Next Generation reviewed the 3DO version of the game and gave it a two out

820
01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:55,920
of five stars and said, and I'm going to read the quote, if you accept its looks, it plays fine,

821
01:16:55,920 --> 01:17:00,240
but this is as much yesterday's technology as any sprite based fighter attempting to get away

822
01:17:00,240 --> 01:17:06,800
with digitized characters. It's almost too bad, but it's just a game out of time. And that's the

823
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:15,200
game. Balls. Alright, not a game that, you know, we don't always spotlight games that were incredible,

824
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:23,040
but this was certainly unique. I mean, this was very much a product of its time. Oh, was it?

825
01:17:23,680 --> 01:17:27,440
I think someone mentioned it. So I was like, yeah, I'll do it. Yeah. No, it's a good pick,

826
01:17:27,440 --> 01:17:32,720
but it's definitely a product of its era. I do also have some late breaking news or more

827
01:17:32,720 --> 01:17:36,720
recently news. Oh, what's that? Like as another story, if you don't mind. Sure, go for it.

828
01:17:37,760 --> 01:17:42,080
Warning to people playing Dead by Daylight right now, there's a series of DDoS attacks where they

829
01:17:42,080 --> 01:17:49,280
follow your IP. And in some cases, they're able to cut through VPNs. So I would highly suggest

830
01:17:49,280 --> 01:17:53,680
if you're going to play DVD right now, play through a VPN, make sure it's a really strong one.

831
01:17:55,440 --> 01:18:02,320
I'm not too worried myself because I play through Geforce, which is a virtual environment.

832
01:18:03,040 --> 01:18:06,320
But at the same time, I just wanted to go and put that out there. And of course,

833
01:18:06,320 --> 01:18:10,720
we don't have any word from behavior yet. No, of course not. It's Sunday. They're not

834
01:18:10,720 --> 01:18:15,440
even in the office. So yeah, it's just worth mentioning. Yeah. Alright.

835
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:21,520
Uh, let's rapidly tackle some other news going on in the industry with some rapid fire news.

836
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:28,800
We'll start with Loki. Yeah. So more Nintendo Lego sets coming. And now we're going to get

837
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:36,640
Lego Donkey Kong coming out this summer, uh, as part of the Lego Mario series of sets.

838
01:18:36,640 --> 01:18:43,280
Along with that, they also unveiled, uh, a brand new Dry Bowser castle that's coming out August

839
01:18:43,280 --> 01:18:50,960
1st for $110. Uh, this was, uh, Lego's Mario day announcements that they had. Um,

840
01:18:52,160 --> 01:18:59,760
it's all too expensive. And apparently Mario is riding, um, Donkey Kong like a Yoshi or something.

841
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:06,880
That's kind of weird. Um, also for Mario day, of course, we got a brand new, uh, Mario movie direct

842
01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:14,160
with the final trailer. It looks cool. Lots of Mario cartness and we even get fire Donkey Kong.

843
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:19,600
So go check it out. I can't wait to see the movie. It's like less than a month away now.

844
01:19:20,240 --> 01:19:25,200
Yeah. For all my issues with one particular casting, I just feel like everything we've

845
01:19:25,200 --> 01:19:30,880
seen about it seems to rise above it. So I'll probably check it out. Um, if someone will take

846
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:37,760
me on a date, but maybe Alan will actually see it. Who knows? We, we very rarely get out to

847
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:41,120
movies. It's funny. Cause I was commenting to somebody the other day. I was like, yeah,

848
01:19:41,120 --> 01:19:45,520
I think I've only seen two movies in the theater in the last year. And one of them was everything

849
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:49,840
everywhere all at once, you know, for all the talk about the movie going on tonight. I'm like,

850
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:54,720
I think that's like one of two movies I saw in the theater in the last year or so. Um,

851
01:19:54,720 --> 01:20:00,160
maybe super Mario brothers will be one for this year. We'll see. Let's see. All right.

852
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:05,040
I hear that the judges and dragons movie is awesome too. Like the reviews have been great

853
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:11,840
so far, which is funny because the nineties one was not so no, that was a terrible movie.

854
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:17,440
It'd be nice if they flipped the script a little. I really liked actually the one they did. And of

855
01:20:17,440 --> 01:20:22,480
course, Kroll was originally supposed to be a D and D movie. Interesting. All right. Uh,

856
01:20:22,480 --> 01:20:29,600
Darcy, you had a quick story for us here. Yeah, I guess I do. Um, so surprising to really

857
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:36,960
nobody that's watched the show. Last of Us is the highest ranked video game adaptation of all time.

858
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:42,000
It's been getting great reviews. It's been renewed for a second season. It had the second high,

859
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:48,880
second largest debut, uh, according to HBO. Um, it's behind actually the house of the dragon

860
01:20:49,440 --> 01:20:59,040
and it's been just considered amazing. It got, uh, a 9.4, uh, out of 10 across the boards for,

861
01:20:59,040 --> 01:21:08,160
uh, uh, IMDB and a lot of the ranking systems. Um, it actually almost matches the games ranking,

862
01:21:08,160 --> 01:21:17,920
which was a 9.7. Um, and the user, uh, rankings on IMDB are like just astounding over the,

863
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:21,840
over the moon. It's, it's better than the Witcher in part, in terms of how it was ranked as well.

864
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:28,400
And it's even ranking over Castlevania and definitely over Halo, which was terrible,

865
01:21:28,400 --> 01:21:37,280
but yeah, as far as the video game ones, just to go through, um, uh, the, uh, adaptation.

866
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:42,800
So last of us is at the top followed by the Witcher and the league of legends was as arcane

867
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:50,000
Castlevania, Halo, Tron uprising. I don't know why that's there because it was not the video

868
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:57,760
game. The dragon age absolution was also pretty, pretty up there, but above all of it, um,

869
01:21:58,640 --> 01:22:03,120
and number nine on the list, by the way, is Mass Effect Paragon lost, which was pretty good.

870
01:22:04,240 --> 01:22:07,840
Our arcane that league of legends one is apparently really good, even if you don't

871
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:11,280
really follow legal legends. So I thought that was interesting. So I'm not surprised

872
01:22:11,280 --> 01:22:17,600
that's popping up there. So, um, but, uh, I just, uh, at some point I'll get around to watching the

873
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:21,840
last of us. I'm just so behind on TV. You know what? I finally watched this week, especially

874
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:27,440
considering the cruise I just went on. I finally started watching lower decks this week. It's

875
01:22:27,440 --> 01:22:32,880
really funny. I like, I'm actually glad I finally got motivated to watch it cause it is really funny.

876
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:39,040
So, and the, the characters in it are so good. So, you know, I only have what, like 28 more

877
01:22:39,040 --> 01:22:42,400
episodes of that to watch and then I can get around to a last of us to some of this other

878
01:22:42,400 --> 01:22:47,360
stuff I'm behind on. So I'm just that cool hip old man watching shows from five years ago.

879
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:55,120
All right. Uh, speaking of up and coming new things, you can check out the Xbox games showcase

880
01:22:55,120 --> 01:23:00,560
on June 11th. That's going to be immediately followed by a star field direct. So it's going

881
01:23:00,560 --> 01:23:06,720
to be a big day for lots of Xbox games. Of course, that date probably sounding very much like an E3

882
01:23:06,720 --> 01:23:14,000
kind of date. And considering we still don't, by the way, less than three months out until E3 and

883
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:21,200
we don't even have confirmation that it's actually happening. Um, I'll just leave that there, but

884
01:23:21,200 --> 01:23:26,000
Microsoft will be doing a game showcase if you know, nothing else on June 11th. And I imagine

885
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:30,160
not only will we hear about star field, but maybe some of the other releases from Microsoft this

886
01:23:30,160 --> 01:23:38,480
year, I'm hoping for fable. I'm hoping for some news on fable. I really want to know what playground

887
01:23:38,480 --> 01:23:44,000
for fable. Yeah. The, uh, uh, Forza horizon team is done with the fable series because Forza

888
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:49,520
horizon is, you know, they, they, there are many people, myself among them that will say, that's

889
01:23:49,520 --> 01:23:54,160
the reason to own an Xbox. That is the game you are truly missing. If you are not on Microsoft's

890
01:23:54,160 --> 01:24:00,240
platform is horizon. Even if you're not a racing game fan, it horizon is that good. And, uh, the

891
01:24:00,240 --> 01:24:06,080
fact that they're going to be working on now fable makes me really curious what they're going to do

892
01:24:06,080 --> 01:24:11,520
with it. Uh, Zen monkey 11 and chat says, it's just going to be a fable MMO light game. I don't,

893
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:16,880
I don't maybe, I am sorry. Don't threaten me with a good time. I know that actually would not be a

894
01:24:16,880 --> 01:24:22,240
bad thing. I mean, could it be open world the way the horizon is open world that it's a little bit

895
01:24:22,240 --> 01:24:26,640
more drop in and drop out? Like I don't want to just assume because horizon has done a certain

896
01:24:26,640 --> 01:24:30,400
way fable is going to be done the same way. I think the developers have the bandwidth to do

897
01:24:30,400 --> 01:24:37,040
other stuff with it if they want. So, uh, anyway, I'll be very curious to see what comes out of

898
01:24:37,040 --> 01:24:43,280
this, but we'll, we'll all find out together on June 11th. Is that a show night? Cause I know,

899
01:24:43,280 --> 01:24:48,800
uh, I'm having a peek ahead June. Yes. June 11th is a show night. Ooh, this could be interesting.

900
01:24:48,800 --> 01:24:53,200
This could be an interesting summer. All right, we'll see. Uh, let's travel around the world and

901
01:24:53,200 --> 01:24:57,600
check out some releases, some things that are going to be coming out a little sooner than fable

902
01:24:57,600 --> 01:25:04,240
on the Xbox, uh, things this week in the U S and beyond starting in the U S Loki. Uh, we have hot

903
01:25:04,240 --> 01:25:10,480
wheels, rift rally on iOS PlayStation form PlayStation five, uh, the legend of heroes trails

904
01:25:10,480 --> 01:25:18,080
to Azure on PC, Nintendo switch and PlayStation four, uh, Valheim coming to Xbox one and Xbox

905
01:25:18,080 --> 01:25:24,560
series. Vernal edge on PC, Nintendo switch, PlayStation four, PlayStation five, Xbox one

906
01:25:24,560 --> 01:25:32,880
and Xbox series. Alice gear, agus CS, uh, concentro of the symbol tricks, I guess,

907
01:25:33,440 --> 01:25:38,960
civil tricks, uh, that's on the Nintendo switch PlayStation four and PlayStation five,

908
01:25:38,960 --> 01:25:44,800
the dark pictures, switchback VR. I thought that was a large game, but as this kind of launch,

909
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:52,800
uh, that is on PlayStation VR to, uh, post void, the Nintendo switch and PlayStation four,

910
01:25:53,600 --> 01:26:01,040
Bayonetta origins, Theresa and the lost demon on Nintendo switch flame keeper on PC and

911
01:26:01,040 --> 01:26:09,840
Nintendo switch. And, uh, last but not least WWE two K 23 on PC, PlayStation four, PlayStation

912
01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:16,160
five, Xbox one and Xbox series. Uh, before we get to Japan, great question from chat regarding the

913
01:26:16,160 --> 01:26:20,960
Xbox event when dark to see a pointed out, uh, that he wasn't sure what time it was going to be

914
01:26:20,960 --> 01:26:25,680
at. They haven't announced the time. And that is very interesting. I would bank that it's probably

915
01:26:25,680 --> 01:26:29,840
going to be more of a morning ish event. I don't think necessarily like 9.00 AM, but it could be

916
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:35,680
more like an 11 AM, maybe even as early as 10 AM. Here's my logic behind that, um, Europe, or,

917
01:26:35,680 --> 01:26:40,560
you know, not all of Europe, but you know, the, the, the main Europe time is going to be five

918
01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:46,000
hours ahead of Eastern time, which is eight hours ahead of Pacific time. So something that's at

919
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:50,960
noon for us in California is going to be at 8 PM for Europe or prime time. If they are going to

920
01:26:50,960 --> 01:26:55,280
feature a game like fable being developed by a studio in Europe, it makes a lot of sense for

921
01:26:55,280 --> 01:26:59,520
them to do that with the world being the way it's laid out. Somebody is always going to have it in

922
01:26:59,520 --> 01:27:04,720
the middle of the night. Um, Japan being in the middle of the night for Microsoft makes a lot of

923
01:27:04,720 --> 01:27:09,840
sense. Microsoft is, it doesn't have as much to show Japan. We all know that. So, uh, it makes

924
01:27:09,840 --> 01:27:15,120
sense that because if they did it in the morning here, it would be something like, God, probably

925
01:27:15,120 --> 01:27:20,480
like three in the morning for Japan. But I think Microsoft's probably willing to, uh, cut that loss.

926
01:27:21,120 --> 01:27:25,440
Whereas if they did it in the, at the, in the night here, if they did it at a 5 PM or an 8 PM

927
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:30,480
slot, it's going to be like one or 2 AM for Europe. And I think, uh, Microsoft's not going

928
01:27:30,480 --> 01:27:34,960
to want to do that. So we'll see what happens though. Uh, anything could happen and, you know,

929
01:27:34,960 --> 01:27:40,320
if maybe they have a big announcement that they want Japan's attention for, uh, anything is

930
01:27:40,320 --> 01:27:45,120
possible. Speaking of Japan, let's check out the releases that they are getting this week.

931
01:27:45,120 --> 01:27:51,840
We'll start with the Nintendo switch, which sees Dawn of the monsters this week, as well as Jitsu

932
01:27:51,840 --> 01:27:57,760
squad in a regular and special edition. This week, six target star trail is out in a regular

933
01:27:57,760 --> 01:28:04,320
and limited edition stranger of sword city, as well as blue winged. Chevalier comes out this

934
01:28:04,320 --> 01:28:10,480
week. Uh, also Bayonetta origins, uh, in a lockstep with the European release of Bayonetta

935
01:28:10,480 --> 01:28:15,680
origins and the U S release on St. Patrick's day. So Bayonetta is also out on the switch.

936
01:28:15,680 --> 01:28:20,560
That game is releasing a lot sooner than I would have expected it to, but I guess it has been in

937
01:28:20,640 --> 01:28:24,720
those directs lately. So it's just, I'm just like, Whoa, that game is suddenly coming. Okay. I

938
01:28:24,720 --> 01:28:29,680
thought that was like a summer game. Anyway, PlayStation five, you really only have Dawn

939
01:28:29,680 --> 01:28:38,400
of the monsters this week, but you also have an, a no, a no 1800. Uh, this is a, uh, Ubisoft game.

940
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:44,720
That's like old warships type of thing. So, uh, 1800 probably being the year. Uh, so that is out

941
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:50,480
this week as well. And, uh, that is it for PlayStation five releases this week.

942
01:28:50,480 --> 01:28:58,400
Let's go over to Europe, dark soccer. We have on the 14th, uh, transport fever two for PlayStation

943
01:28:58,400 --> 01:29:07,760
X-Box for the same also clash artifacts of chaos, Zeno edition, WWE two K 23 deluxe edition on the

944
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:15,280
16th for PlayStation switch. We have Alice gear Aegis, um, for PlayStation and X-Box we have, uh,

945
01:29:15,280 --> 01:29:23,040
I know 1800 console edition, uh, for, uh, PC. We are, I should say just for computer, we have,

946
01:29:23,040 --> 01:29:28,880
uh, the Sims four going together expansion on the 17th for PlayStation and switch. We have a signal

947
01:29:28,880 --> 01:29:36,800
us, um, on switch, we have Bayonetta origins, Theresa and the lost demon on, uh, the three,

948
01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:43,680
we have Peppa pig world adventures. Um, on the 17th for PlayStation X-Box, we have WWE

949
01:29:43,680 --> 01:29:49,120
two K 23, um, for PlayStation switch, we have windstorm and unexpected arrival.

950
01:29:51,680 --> 01:29:56,480
All right. A few more stories for y'all, and then we'll get to the listener round table

951
01:29:56,480 --> 01:30:00,160
featuring your emails. Actually, I don't think we have emails tonight, but maybe we'll see

952
01:30:00,160 --> 01:30:05,680
participate at orange.com, uh, phone calls and chat comments. Uh, we'll get to that in a minute

953
01:30:05,680 --> 01:30:12,400
though, but first we have some more stories for you. Loki. Yeah. So, um, with the new update that

954
01:30:12,400 --> 01:30:18,240
came out for Mario Kart eight, it of course added Berto to the roster of characters,

955
01:30:18,240 --> 01:30:25,040
but along with that, a new column for, uh, new characters. And now it appears that there's still

956
01:30:25,040 --> 01:30:30,560
five more new characters coming to Mario Kart eight. So that's exciting. Um, we'll have to

957
01:30:30,560 --> 01:30:36,640
see who exactly is going to be coming, but, um, I guess in the future DLC, we'll see those five

958
01:30:36,640 --> 01:30:42,800
characters come in. Orange. Right. And chat says pink, gold, Daisy. Don't joke about that because

959
01:30:42,800 --> 01:30:48,560
honestly like just alternate skins of existing care. I bet I'm going to put, I'm going to put

960
01:30:48,560 --> 01:30:53,440
an official OLR bet an official Rob Roberts prediction. At least one of those characters

961
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:57,840
is just some terrible reskin of an existing character.

962
01:30:59,520 --> 01:31:02,960
But I bet we'll get a couple. I bet we'll get a couple interesting ones in that.

963
01:31:02,960 --> 01:31:07,360
I'm not sure who's missing. Oh, fire emblem. We don't have anyone from fire emblem in the game

964
01:31:07,360 --> 01:31:13,840
yet. Right. You will get someone from the Mario movie. We can get the, one of those penguins.

965
01:31:14,800 --> 01:31:19,120
Oh, that might be cute. A Mario movie tie-in. I like what you're thinking with that. Yeah.

966
01:31:19,120 --> 01:31:25,280
Maybe one of the penguins or something. Huh? That's a cute idea. Yeah. Mike Defton chat says

967
01:31:25,280 --> 01:31:31,680
silver Yoshi and Birdo. Oh, yo Yoshi's a prime target for the really cheap reskin type of thing.

968
01:31:31,680 --> 01:31:36,320
Cause Yoshi already had reskins. That's in the lore. If you want to go back to super Mario world

969
01:31:36,320 --> 01:31:41,440
and like the red Yoshi that shoots fire. Well, you can do that already in Mario card eight. You can,

970
01:31:41,440 --> 01:31:46,080
you select Yoshi and you can choose the ultimate thing for that. I haven't played in so long. I

971
01:31:46,080 --> 01:31:50,880
don't even remember that. So, but yeah, there's stupid things like metal Mario where it's like

972
01:31:50,880 --> 01:31:56,080
gold Mario and yeah. Yeah. So pink gold. All right. We'll see. We'll see. All right.

973
01:31:58,480 --> 01:32:08,240
Moving on dark soccer. Amazon's got actually an abstract proposed for something called Alexa

974
01:32:09,040 --> 01:32:15,680
arena, which excuse me, my voice is catching. Which basically is an interactive platform

975
01:32:16,640 --> 01:32:25,200
for AI training where you go through the game and it's, you have to like do just certain

976
01:32:25,200 --> 01:32:31,840
normal tasks, a specific way. Like one is plug the floppy disc into the computer with a skull on it,

977
01:32:32,480 --> 01:32:38,080
you know, and it's like this, the scenario laid out is going into an office, but it's supposed to

978
01:32:38,160 --> 01:32:48,480
work for machine learning to apply to everyday office use and personal assistant use. So yeah,

979
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:54,400
our robot overlords are getting closer. This kind of ties in a little bit so that

980
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:57,840
I know you were here at the beginning of the show. We were talking in depth a little bit about AI,

981
01:32:58,560 --> 01:33:01,360
you know, and that seems to be the next big thing in gaming because, you know,

982
01:33:01,360 --> 01:33:07,440
Discord's been doing a lot with AI and this, you know, training the robots, how to kind of,

983
01:33:07,440 --> 01:33:11,760
it's interesting that a lot of companies are going this direction. It's going to be very

984
01:33:12,480 --> 01:33:19,360
interesting to see. I've taken some courses in machine learning and it actually,

985
01:33:20,800 --> 01:33:24,320
they can't really do anything without the information that we feed them. So they have

986
01:33:24,320 --> 01:33:30,480
to build up a massive database of information. Doing a game to do this is actually a pretty

987
01:33:30,480 --> 01:33:36,640
smart idea. You know, I'm just saying. There are clever ways to get people's data,

988
01:33:36,640 --> 01:33:42,720
absolutely. No, I'm not saying this is for people's data. This is for training in AI by providing it

989
01:33:42,720 --> 01:33:45,680
feedback. My brain went to- This has nothing to do with personal data.

990
01:33:45,680 --> 01:33:52,960
My brain went to Pokemon sleep and how that is like using cute little, cute Pokemon to

991
01:33:52,960 --> 01:33:58,400
farm people's sleeping data. Which is, this is something completely different. This is teaching

992
01:33:58,400 --> 01:34:02,640
activity and giving it a broad range of activity to add to its learning.

993
01:34:02,640 --> 01:34:06,640
All right. My brain's a little bit on this whole stealing things.

994
01:34:06,640 --> 01:34:08,080
That's not how machine learning works.

995
01:34:08,720 --> 01:34:12,640
Well, say that to the AI art robots because that's-

996
01:34:12,640 --> 01:34:17,920
That's a little different. This is more for teaching an assistive AI.

997
01:34:19,200 --> 01:34:20,880
All right. Moving on. Loki.

998
01:34:21,520 --> 01:34:29,040
All right. So this is not too surprising, but you know, after the reveal of the Suicide Squad

999
01:34:29,040 --> 01:34:34,160
gameplay that was recently part of the deep dive that they did in the PlayStation,

1000
01:34:35,360 --> 01:34:41,040
was it PlayStation Now event that they had, fans were very disappointed by what they saw.

1001
01:34:41,760 --> 01:34:50,240
And as such, Rocksteady has now delayed the game from May to sometime later this year to

1002
01:34:51,840 --> 01:34:54,400
address those concerns from-

1003
01:34:55,040 --> 01:34:58,880
Taking a page out of the first Sonic the Hedgehog trailer playbook, right?

1004
01:34:59,680 --> 01:35:01,360
Something to that effect. Yeah.

1005
01:35:01,360 --> 01:35:04,080
Hey, you know what? It worked out well for that movie. So

1006
01:35:04,640 --> 01:35:08,320
maybe- Honestly, this actually is probably news we should be applauding.

1007
01:35:08,320 --> 01:35:09,920
I don't think we should be looking at this going-

1008
01:35:10,480 --> 01:35:17,760
Yeah. Basically saying- Jason Schreier explained that, you know, don't expect any big changes,

1009
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:21,680
but you know, instead it's gonna be some polishing as to what's already there.

1010
01:35:24,480 --> 01:35:30,000
They're gonna have to make some changes though, because it looked pretty not great.

1011
01:35:32,480 --> 01:35:37,280
You know what? It's just like, Suicide Squad's just not crack down. Please don't make it crack

1012
01:35:37,280 --> 01:35:46,480
down. All right. Well, this particular series isn't Persona, but that's not going to stop

1013
01:35:46,480 --> 01:35:54,240
somebody from trying. And yes, I've been sent this little movie a lot. And I think technically

1014
01:35:54,240 --> 01:35:58,400
it came up at the end of the show last week, but let's talk now officially on record about

1015
01:35:58,960 --> 01:36:03,280
the Persona type RPG where you are going to play as the Golden Girls.

1016
01:36:04,640 --> 01:36:09,440
That's right. It's the Golden Girls Take Manhattan DX, and it's developed by Joey

1017
01:36:09,440 --> 01:36:15,760
Pagano and Chris Lindgren. It's a fast paced JRPG where you play as Rose, Dorothy, Sophia,

1018
01:36:15,760 --> 01:36:22,080
and Blanche on the streets of Miami where you're battling clowns for whatever reason. And you do

1019
01:36:22,080 --> 01:36:28,320
Dark Souls type adventures through dungeons. There's a whole trailer as well that came out,

1020
01:36:28,320 --> 01:36:34,400
which I don't know how this isn't getting cease and desisted, but apparently what happened,

1021
01:36:34,400 --> 01:36:42,400
and this is all on the Game Dev website, if you want to read at j-e-o-y.dev, you can read the

1022
01:36:42,400 --> 01:36:46,560
blog that says, what started as a joke has quickly spiraled into a playground of ideas meant to

1023
01:36:46,560 --> 01:36:51,600
explore just how much we can push our skills and retain our sanity with our own brand of humor.

1024
01:36:51,600 --> 01:36:56,320
Simply put, this is Persona 5's gameplay replaced with the context of the Golden Girls. There is no

1025
01:36:56,320 --> 01:37:01,440
reason why we use that coat of paint other than how far can we take this joke? I'm a little

1026
01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:08,240
worried it's going to get C&D'd over that, but otherwise it's scheduled to release this holiday

1027
01:37:08,240 --> 01:37:20,480
season. In looking at the trailer, the characters look different enough. When you do something like

1028
01:37:20,480 --> 01:37:29,600
this, it doesn't just have to be like the Golden Girls IP, but then you also have the likenesses

1029
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:38,240
to the actresses that played Blanche, Sophia, and so forth. And I would say that I don't think

1030
01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:46,480
that the rose really looks like Betty White, but the Dorothy looks a lot like Bea Arthur to me.

1031
01:37:47,120 --> 01:37:53,840
So I feel like that's a whole other place that this could get tied up, because what was it?

1032
01:37:54,320 --> 01:38:01,600
Oops, not the intro playing again. Was it the Clue game or something? There's some official

1033
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:06,720
license thing out there. I think it's the Clue game. Sophia looks nothing like Sophia,

1034
01:38:07,440 --> 01:38:12,000
and I think it's because they probably couldn't get the estate of Estelle Getty to sign on to it.

1035
01:38:12,640 --> 01:38:19,120
So whether it's a tied up in logistics thing or they really just didn't want to be associated

1036
01:38:19,120 --> 01:38:24,240
with it or whatever the reason is. Anyway, my point is never announce these things this far

1037
01:38:24,240 --> 01:38:28,400
in advance unless you're ready to drop the game on the internet tomorrow. And it's a once on the

1038
01:38:28,400 --> 01:38:32,880
internet, always on the internet type of situation because I feel like this is going to get cease and

1039
01:38:32,880 --> 01:38:38,560
desisted. And they're going to have to change those characters into Grandma RPG, you know,

1040
01:38:38,560 --> 01:38:43,520
with nondescript older, you know, which we'll all know what it is wink wink nudge, but

1041
01:38:43,520 --> 01:38:48,000
well, I mean, if they give them guns, and that would suffice for one of our dreams.

1042
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:52,560
That is that is okay, but okay, but Golden Girls will win.

1043
01:38:53,360 --> 01:39:00,560
Hey, I'd be into that. That's for sure. Ah, some comments and chat Zen monkey with some lore.

1044
01:39:01,440 --> 01:39:05,680
I think they did a popular Golden Girls episode with a clown. I think Dorothy's husband was

1045
01:39:05,680 --> 01:39:10,560
dressed like a clown or something. I'm sure they got Stan. In fact, that is a image that's coming

1046
01:39:10,560 --> 01:39:16,560
to my mind to stand in a clown outfit because it's a really, you know, funny image when she's

1047
01:39:16,560 --> 01:39:24,720
talking about her ex. So anyway, uh, let's see. Fifth Dream says olden gals. Yeah, that just

1048
01:39:24,720 --> 01:39:28,960
changed the name a little bit. Rhetortainment points out there's a reason why the Golden Girls

1049
01:39:28,960 --> 01:39:33,200
Chia pet doesn't look like any of the Golden Girls. They'd have to pay the Estator. Yeah,

1050
01:39:33,200 --> 01:39:38,480
it's exactly that type of thing for sure. So and everybody in chat is like,

1051
01:39:38,480 --> 01:39:44,640
just base it off of Golden Palace instead. That's true. If they can't get the estate of

1052
01:39:45,440 --> 01:39:50,240
Bea Arthur to sign on, they sure could. They'd have to get who was it? Was it Cheech

1053
01:39:50,240 --> 01:39:57,120
from Cheech and Chong was in that as well. And then one other well known actor today.

1054
01:39:57,120 --> 01:40:03,680
Was it Don Cheadle was in that? I want to say yes, Don Cheadle was in that. Yes, that's it.

1055
01:40:03,680 --> 01:40:09,440
So. All right. Moving on. Yeah, I would expect you would know these things Loki because I know

1056
01:40:09,440 --> 01:40:13,600
your wife has made you watch them all. I have never watched Golden Palace. Really?

1057
01:40:13,600 --> 01:40:17,680
Actually, you know, I take that back. I may have seen it on TV like when it was actually on like

1058
01:40:17,680 --> 01:40:22,240
a long time ago, but I remember it when it was actually on TV. We used to watch like,

1059
01:40:22,240 --> 01:40:28,160
we used to watch Golden Girls that I think my grandparents house or maybe watch it at home too.

1060
01:40:28,160 --> 01:40:32,960
I don't know. But it was like a staple. It was definitely something we watched when it was on

1061
01:40:32,960 --> 01:40:37,680
like actually airing on TV. And I'm pretty sure that we watched at least I've seen like

1062
01:40:37,680 --> 01:40:43,120
a an episode of Golden Palace. It was only on for one season. Golden Palace was essentially the

1063
01:40:43,120 --> 01:40:47,600
eighth season of Golden Girls without Bea Arthur. You know, it's just yeah, it's very,

1064
01:40:47,600 --> 01:40:51,520
very different. That's why I didn't do it was on a different network. It wasn't on NBC was on CBS.

1065
01:40:54,960 --> 01:41:01,360
Yeah, no, I was just gonna say with that I was gonna say Golden Girls was on for so long. It

1066
01:41:01,360 --> 01:41:07,040
was on for like seven years that by the time they got to Golden Palace, it was like 92.

1067
01:41:07,040 --> 01:41:11,360
So that's around the time at least for me, I was like a freshman, sophomore in high school by the

1068
01:41:11,360 --> 01:41:17,680
time you know that happened. So I wasn't that young when that came out. So that was our staple

1069
01:41:17,680 --> 01:41:24,720
in designing women. Oh, and that was the night that the lights went out. Well before it was a

1070
01:41:24,720 --> 01:41:29,760
Drag Race monologue lip sync. But if they were going to pick any monologue to be a lip sync on

1071
01:41:29,760 --> 01:41:37,040
that television program, that is the one to do so I will give them that. So now now I just now I

1072
01:41:37,040 --> 01:41:44,320
can't even see like, what was her name? It wasn't Delta Burke. It was. Oh, my God, the other star

1073
01:41:44,320 --> 01:41:52,240
that show. I can't remember her name. Dixie Carter. Dixie Carter. Yeah, yeah. Um, I now I

1074
01:41:52,240 --> 01:41:58,240
see Monet X Change doing it in my mind. I don't even see Dixie Carter doing it. All right.

1075
01:41:58,880 --> 01:42:03,760
I mean, I will say when when someone says the the night the lights went out of Georgia, I think of

1076
01:42:03,760 --> 01:42:09,920
Vicki Lawrence. Yes, there is that too. I know that because that was the staple in my household

1077
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:18,000
was mama's family. And my mother loved, loved, loved Carol Burnett and everything associated

1078
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:24,400
with it. Vicki Lawrence's rendition of that song is just like, gives me chills. Oh, yeah. All

1079
01:42:24,400 --> 01:42:28,800
right. Let's move on. That was it. That was it for the last story. I can't believe I put that

1080
01:42:28,800 --> 01:42:34,960
story last. Yes. All right. No, I will. I'm not like it's just it's funny, like how many times

1081
01:42:34,960 --> 01:42:41,200
that was sent to me. But I, I don't like I get to the point where I appreciate that those sorts of

1082
01:42:41,200 --> 01:42:46,320
things make people think of me. I do appreciate it. All right. Let's get to the listener round

1083
01:42:46,320 --> 01:42:52,080
table. If you would like to email us participate at OrangeLawnTrader.com or you'd like to call us

1084
01:42:52,080 --> 01:42:57,520
by joining our green room over on Discord vog network.com slash discord if you'd like to join

1085
01:42:57,520 --> 01:43:02,560
our Discord server. Or we can just reminisce about 80s TV shows like y'all are doing in chat. But

1086
01:43:02,560 --> 01:43:08,000
seriously, anything you want to bring up as well we can talk about here. I just want to confirm I

1087
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:13,040
don't think we have emails tonight just confirming that. Okay, so I thought we had junk. We had Oh,

1088
01:43:13,040 --> 01:43:16,560
yay junk. My favorite. Maybe it's time to change the address again. I don't know.

1089
01:43:17,120 --> 01:43:22,560
Um, no, we don't get that much junk. No, it was it was bad when we changed it the first time it was

1090
01:43:22,560 --> 01:43:30,720
bad, but it's not so bad anymore. Let's see. Michigan says, you know, I never knew Vicki

1091
01:43:30,720 --> 01:43:35,200
Lawrence was the one who originally sang that song. I feel dumb now thinking it was Reba.

1092
01:43:35,200 --> 01:43:39,920
I thought there was someone before Vicki even. Or I thought it was a old old song.

1093
01:43:41,200 --> 01:43:45,280
Yeah, it's supposed to be an older song. Yeah. I think Vicki just had like a

1094
01:43:47,360 --> 01:43:53,920
very successful version of it. All right, so the it was a southern gothic murder ballad written in

1095
01:43:53,920 --> 01:44:02,560
1972. By Bobby Russell and recorded by his then wife Vicki Lawrence. Hers is the original.

1096
01:44:02,560 --> 01:44:08,160
Really? I thought there was a version before. Okay. How about that? All right.

1097
01:44:09,040 --> 01:44:12,640
And then it was covered by Reba McEntire in 1991. Right.

1098
01:44:12,640 --> 01:44:20,240
Yeah, whenever I think a Reba, I'm only gonna think of fancy. That is the definitive Reba

1099
01:44:20,240 --> 01:44:27,440
song for me. I used to have a hat. I miss my hat that I got in Vegas. So you know Reba

1100
01:44:27,440 --> 01:44:33,120
played the Vegas show that was at the Celine amphitheater that Adele's in now, right? Reba

1101
01:44:33,120 --> 01:44:37,360
had a show there for a little bit. And when I was in Vegas, we didn't get to see the show sadly,

1102
01:44:37,360 --> 01:44:41,920
but there's always the souvenir shop. So I bought a hat. It was a cool little black hat. You might

1103
01:44:41,920 --> 01:44:48,800
remember this. It said fancy on the hat. I love that hat. Unfortunately, the fancy lettering

1104
01:44:48,800 --> 01:44:55,200
started to tear off. It was no good anymore. So cheaply made hat. I know who did the other

1105
01:44:55,200 --> 01:45:01,120
version. Tanya Tucker did one with alternate lyrics. Ah, maybe I was thinking of Tanya Tucker.

1106
01:45:01,120 --> 01:45:09,200
Okay. Yeah. Anyway. All right. And there's your country music history of the day. Thank you.

1107
01:45:12,080 --> 01:45:17,920
sj100matt says we need a TV 8090 sitcom special episode. We still need Orange Launch Fudio.

1108
01:45:17,920 --> 01:45:21,440
We got to make that happen. We've been talking about that for a while. I guess I need to lock

1109
01:45:21,440 --> 01:45:25,520
down a date with my co hosts here. Now that I'm back from the cruise and all that stuff. So

1110
01:45:27,040 --> 01:45:34,560
we'll make that happen. Yeah. All right. What other special shows would you like to see here

1111
01:45:34,560 --> 01:45:41,120
at VOG Network? Because the the special cast on the cruise was fun. I'll bring grandpa back for

1112
01:45:41,120 --> 01:45:46,880
something else. He was surprisingly well behaved compared to his days on Hoard House. I think he

1113
01:45:46,880 --> 01:45:53,840
I think he got the memo that some things have changed. He's mellowed some. I wouldn't say

1114
01:45:53,840 --> 01:46:00,080
mellowed but he's he is he's adjusted his digs on me. He was he still gave me hell but he adjusted

1115
01:46:00,080 --> 01:46:07,280
them appropriately. So it's good. By the way, Ron Shawn I can do an 80s style music. Just wait.

1116
01:46:07,920 --> 01:46:12,560
Okay. We have an anniversary. So coming up in June, maybe we'll we'll play around with some

1117
01:46:12,560 --> 01:46:19,680
of that. All right. Anyway. All right. Well, not a lot of other activity coming in. So you know

1118
01:46:19,680 --> 01:46:23,440
what I think I think even though it's a little shorter tonight, I think we've hit the end of the

1119
01:46:23,440 --> 01:46:29,360
show. This is what it is. I know I just got here. I know. There's stuff on TV that has people's

1120
01:46:29,360 --> 01:46:34,800
attention to I don't know if you heard about that whole thing going on tonight. So the Oscars are

1121
01:46:34,800 --> 01:46:40,640
tonight. Oh, shit. I don't pay attention. I know we will we've been doing this for over 20 years.

1122
01:46:40,640 --> 01:46:47,680
So we kind of but you know, I important I noticed the nights that big things are on TV. It's also

1123
01:46:47,680 --> 01:46:52,560
to be fair. It's also the last of us finale, which I don't know who counter program that on the

1124
01:46:52,560 --> 01:46:57,920
Oscars, but maybe because they have a lot of on demand watchers for that. So there's that. All

1125
01:46:57,920 --> 01:47:02,800
right. Looking for voice talent. Let's go around and get everybody's final thought for the night.

1126
01:47:02,800 --> 01:47:05,440
First off, I'm gonna say thank you so much for listening to Orange Launch Radio. Thank

1127
01:47:05,440 --> 01:47:09,360
you for tuning in. We are the show where every gamer has a voice but to get more voices out

1128
01:47:09,360 --> 01:47:13,040
there. We need them. So tell a friend or two about the show help us spread the word. A nice

1129
01:47:13,040 --> 01:47:18,000
five star review on a site like iTunes goes an awful long way. We appreciate all of that as well

1130
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:23,760
wherever it is you listen to show Spotify. Help us spread the word. We appreciate it. With that,

1131
01:47:23,760 --> 01:47:26,960
we'll get to final thoughts star Sakura. Sorry, you missed most of the show, but I hope you had

1132
01:47:26,960 --> 01:47:32,560
fun with the stream. I did. And it was nice to finally get to participate in that. But I'm

1133
01:47:32,560 --> 01:47:38,320
going to be hopping back into the fog immediately. You're still going tonight. So yeah, I am. Hey,

1134
01:47:38,320 --> 01:47:44,320
you gotta have consistency, right? Yeah, it's important. And rank reset is tomorrow. So I want

1135
01:47:44,320 --> 01:47:51,840
to do as much bullshit gaming while I'm eerie one as I can. Sounds good. All right. All right. Well,

1136
01:47:51,840 --> 01:47:57,760
have a great stream tonight. Later, taters. And remember, bullshit shenanigans. It's a thing.

1137
01:47:57,760 --> 01:48:00,640
Okay, later. Loki, your final thought for tonight?

1138
01:48:03,040 --> 01:48:08,480
My final thought is it's nice to see everything everywhere all at once sweeping the Oscars.

1139
01:48:10,480 --> 01:48:14,160
Did it win? Did it win the big one? Or do we not know? Not yet, but it's won like,

1140
01:48:14,800 --> 01:48:21,920
four or five categories already. What was it? Best Supporting Actress, Best Supporting Actor,

1141
01:48:22,800 --> 01:48:29,360
uh, Best Screenplay. And there's something else. I missed it.

1142
01:48:31,200 --> 01:48:35,280
Let's see, my final thought for tonight. I guess I'll plug my own streaming. Next week,

1143
01:48:35,280 --> 01:48:39,920
I'm going to stream on Tuesday and Thursday. Tuesday, I'm hoping to finish No Man's Sky

1144
01:48:39,920 --> 01:48:44,880
Expedition 9. I don't know if I can actually do it all in one night. So we'll try our best to get it

1145
01:48:44,880 --> 01:48:49,360
done on Tuesday. If not, maybe I'll have to do a bonus stream. I was gonna do a bonus stream over

1146
01:48:49,360 --> 01:48:55,440
the weekend. But if the Diablo 4 beta is this weekend, then no. I don't know if we can stream

1147
01:48:55,440 --> 01:49:00,240
the Diablo 4 beta. I imagine if it's an open beta, we must be able to because I'll be playing

1148
01:49:00,240 --> 01:49:05,280
way too much of that this weekend. Believe it. So if they allow me to stream it, I will. If I'm not

1149
01:49:05,280 --> 01:49:11,600
allowed to, then I won't. Thursday, I'm gonna play more theater. The World Ends With You DLC will be

1150
01:49:11,600 --> 01:49:16,480
out on Thursday. So I look forward to that. Otherwise, I hope everybody has a great week.

1151
01:49:16,480 --> 01:49:20,800
Please be safe if you partake in St. Patrick's Day shenanigans. Although for some reason,

1152
01:49:20,800 --> 01:49:24,480
it seems like a lot of that happened this past weekend. Like they died the river in Chicago

1153
01:49:24,480 --> 01:49:29,680
this weekend when St. Patrick's Day is on a Friday. I don't know. They must do it on a Saturday

1154
01:49:29,680 --> 01:49:37,120
or something. So yeah, I'll be curious to see what shenanigans happen on Friday. But please be safe,

1155
01:49:37,120 --> 01:49:40,880
y'all. And have a good one. That's gonna do it for another episode of Orange Laundry. Have a great

1156
01:49:40,880 --> 01:49:46,320
week. We will see you next time. And be safe, everyone. Have a wonderful night. Bye.

1157
01:50:10,880 --> 01:50:26,640
Those of the staff of orange lounge radio nor fog network, but you know, they were all still true.
