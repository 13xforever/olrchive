WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:13.800
Can it be the year of Silent Hill? I'd really like it to be. Akira Yamaoka is back

00:13.800 --> 00:18.140
with the series, a new movie, a remake, an interactive media experience and two new games

00:18.140 --> 00:22.280
in the works? If it all goes bust, break out your PS2s, your PS4 that gives you anxiety

00:22.280 --> 00:25.320
because it still has PT on it and any other version of the series you liked because the

00:25.320 --> 00:29.400
second hand market is good. While we party like it's 1999, now it's time for your

00:29.400 --> 00:32.680
hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers and Loki to tell you about one of these things and

00:32.680 --> 00:35.760
the rest of the week's gaming news starting right now on the show where every gamer has

00:35.760 --> 00:36.760
a voice.

00:36.760 --> 00:45.240
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

00:45.240 --> 00:51.880
where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are live once again with

00:51.880 --> 00:59.920
the 952nd episode of our show for tonight, March the 19th of 2023. I hope those of you

00:59.920 --> 01:04.520
that celebrated or did whatever for St. Patrick's Day had a good time. Everyone else, I hope

01:04.520 --> 01:08.120
you had a good weekend and here we are on Sunday night to wrap it all up and put a little

01:08.120 --> 01:12.640
bow on our gaming weeks and our gaming weekends and everything that's been going on in the

01:12.640 --> 01:17.560
gaming industry. I am Rob Roberts and I am joined as always by the one and only Dark

01:17.560 --> 01:25.160
Sakura or Jamie Summers up. Hi, how are you doing? I'm all right. I am. I'm a little sore

01:25.160 --> 01:31.400
today because I have been got the I got the okay to get back into doing workouts. And

01:31.400 --> 01:38.600
I started back on my hip workouts to strengthen my hip back up. I've said before I've got

01:38.600 --> 01:43.640
premature arthritis in my right hip and just trying to build the muscle around it and stay

01:43.640 --> 01:50.940
in good shape and prep for a potential Disneyland trip for my birthday. I'll be fine. So if

01:50.940 --> 01:54.680
you're working out does this mean how long until we get a flex redeem on Dark Sakura's

01:54.680 --> 02:01.840
O.L.R.? Oh, a free one on the house here at Vogue Network, where we do tape live every

02:01.840 --> 02:06.360
Sunday night at nine o'clock Eastern, six o'clock Pacific right after the Bobby Black

02:06.360 --> 02:10.580
Wolf show. And if you want to see some of the gun show, we try to keep it minimal on

02:10.580 --> 02:16.340
the visual antics because it is a podcast. It's been a podcast for 21 years about give

02:16.340 --> 02:21.980
or take. And so we try to keep the visuals minimum. But who am I to say no to a free

02:21.980 --> 02:29.140
flex redeem for Dark Sakura O.L.R.? I actually am considering putting up my own flex redeem

02:29.140 --> 02:37.820
soon. Once I'm back to where I was lifting before, it's slow going. I stopped for about

02:37.820 --> 02:44.240
seven months while I was so sick. So I've had to downgrade my weights instead of starting

02:44.240 --> 02:49.820
off with 15s. I'm starting off well, I mean, technically I have a little bar on there,

02:49.820 --> 02:55.080
so I'm actually starting off with 10 and then going to work myself back up to my 15s. And

02:55.080 --> 03:01.980
I'm still using my kettlebell at 35. So eventually I'll have to buy a 55 pound kettlebell. So

03:01.980 --> 03:06.740
all right. Well, I'm not sure how much he's working out, but let's say hello anyway to

03:06.740 --> 03:16.500
Techmaster Loki. I'm not working out at all right now. Can we get a flex redeem? Denied.

03:16.500 --> 03:22.860
How are you doing, Loki? I'm doing OK. Yeah. Yeah. Anything new and exciting in your world?

03:22.860 --> 03:28.860
No. No. Yeah. Mood. I hear you. It's been it's been a week. It's been nothing but rainy

03:28.860 --> 03:33.860
and stormy this week. It sort of means no going out and doing anything fun. It's just

03:33.860 --> 03:37.340
staying in and playing video games. But that's fun, too. Speaking of video games, what is

03:37.340 --> 03:41.620
outside and done stuff? Did you? I didn't. I hardly went outside and did anything. I

03:41.620 --> 03:47.260
went I replanted six plants over the last couple of days because they were getting strangled

03:47.260 --> 03:52.200
in their teensy little pots. Actually, I will say yesterday it was more overcast. So I was

03:52.200 --> 03:57.580
able to go out and do like not to get in my gaming weeks too much, but oops, do like Pokemon

03:57.580 --> 04:02.180
Community Day in Pokemon Go because they had a community day yesterday and then Pikmin,

04:02.180 --> 04:06.500
all the Niantic games had a community day the same day because who coordinates things over

04:06.500 --> 04:12.580
there? I don't know. Coordinate? I can't be bothered to do one office talking to the other.

04:12.580 --> 04:20.100
We can't do that. So yeah, so I did get out Saturday, but that was really it. I got in like

04:20.100 --> 04:25.300
12,000 steps yesterday. So I guess I could guess I could do a little bit. Really, Mike Defton in

04:25.300 --> 04:30.980
our chat because as we tape live, y'all can chat along with us over twitch.tv slash vog network.

04:31.780 --> 04:38.260
Deft says speaking of Pokemon Go Community Day for April is Togetic. Wouldn't that be Togope?

04:38.820 --> 04:42.740
Wouldn't the baby form spawn or are they actually going to form Togetic everywhere?

04:42.740 --> 04:43.780
Is this the upgrade?

04:44.420 --> 04:48.180
Yeah, I was gonna say Togetic is the mid form. So that would be weird if it's not

04:48.180 --> 04:52.420
Togope's. I would expect would be the interesting. Mike Deft says no, it's Togetic.

04:53.220 --> 04:57.380
Interesting. Huh. I wonder why they're doing it that way. I wonder,

04:57.620 --> 05:01.460
oh, Deft says baby forms are not usually found in the wild. Well, for some of the other three,

05:01.460 --> 05:08.180
I mean, if you consider Bulbasaur a baby form or a lot of the other three evolution, right?

05:08.820 --> 05:13.380
Most of the time we do see the base evolution in the wild. So it is a little weird. I think

05:13.380 --> 05:16.980
there's gonna be a lot of people to find that weird, but I'm gonna best...

05:16.980 --> 05:19.700
If you're looking for baby animals in the wild,

05:19.700 --> 05:21.780
you need to make sure that you leave them with your mother.

05:22.660 --> 05:26.740
Yes. Well, I'm gonna guess that for that community day,

05:26.740 --> 05:32.020
they do two kilometer eggs and they do like half hatch distance and all of the eggs are

05:32.020 --> 05:37.540
gonna have Togope. I bet that's what they do to kind of bridge that gap, so to speak.

05:38.100 --> 05:41.620
May have to start playing again just so I can have 57,000 Togope.

05:42.340 --> 05:48.020
Or be like Shane and get like 700 shiny ones for no reason than just you love shinies.

05:48.740 --> 05:57.300
Well, Togope before Mimikyu was invented, Togope was my favorite and I actually have a very special

05:57.300 --> 06:01.940
fond memory for Togope because I don't know, I've told the story about when I got held up

06:01.940 --> 06:06.100
at gunpoint working at GNC, right? Yeah. You've mentioned before scary stuff. Yeah.

06:06.100 --> 06:11.700
Well, Dan took me to Toys R Us to cheer me up and I found a $20 bill in the parking lot

06:12.980 --> 06:17.700
and I used that $20 bill to buy myself a Togope plushie that I still have to this day.

06:17.860 --> 06:23.220
It's sort of like my comfort plushie. Your little karma plushie in some ways.

06:24.020 --> 06:27.780
That's not exactly how karma works. I know, but okay, you know what I mean.

06:28.580 --> 06:35.220
Yeah, but it ended up being like my little comfort, like I kind of felt like

06:35.220 --> 06:40.900
maybe the universe wasn't completely shit. You know, Toys R Us is like half back now.

06:41.700 --> 06:47.700
They're mini stores inside Macy's. So like as I was walking around downtown yesterday,

06:47.700 --> 06:50.980
which by the way was a hoot and a holler here in Sacramento where we're all based,

06:51.620 --> 06:55.940
the NCAA championships were going on at the Golden One Center, or I don't know if it's

06:55.940 --> 07:00.580
championships or qualifier, whatever, but the Sacramento Arena was like a site for that.

07:00.580 --> 07:04.660
So I don't know sports well enough to tell you what game it was, but I just know there were a

07:04.660 --> 07:08.100
fuck ton of people. And yes, that's an actual scientific measurement. There was a fuck ton of

07:08.100 --> 07:11.860
people down there, but I was walking through that area anyway. And there's like that Macy's right

07:11.860 --> 07:16.180
there. Right. And so you walk by the window and they actually have like a, it's a new style

07:16.180 --> 07:21.380
drawing, but they have Jeffrey the giraffe and stuff in the window. Because if you go up to the

07:21.380 --> 07:25.300
second floor, there's like a Toys R Us in the Macy's. So that's what it's like. You know how

07:25.300 --> 07:30.660
there's like Sephora's inside JC Penney? It's like, they do. It's like that. Yeah. It's like

07:30.660 --> 07:39.540
that. I miss the big warehouse. I know. I know, but I sadly think those days may be behind us.

07:39.540 --> 07:43.540
So, but at least if you like the mascots, if you like, if you're a Jeffrey the giraffe fan,

07:43.540 --> 07:51.060
at least there's that. So free ad for them. All right. Also, I actually have a Toys R Us bag from

07:51.060 --> 07:56.180
when they went out of business. Oh, like they got like super cheap or something? Well, no, no. I

07:56.180 --> 08:00.260
mean that like they gave me extra shopping bags, like the plastic bags. Oh, right. Right. Right.

08:00.980 --> 08:07.300
Yeah. Little mementos. All right. Yeah. It was nice. Let's move on to giving free advertisements

08:07.300 --> 08:12.820
for Nintendo because for our lead topic tonight, I want to talk a little bit about the Wii U and

08:12.820 --> 08:19.620
the 3DS are having their stores close. Now, technically the closure date is March 27th.

08:19.620 --> 08:24.100
So that's actually a week from Monday. Part of the reason I want to bring it up tonight though,

08:24.100 --> 08:29.620
is that I would tell you is that if you want to wait until the very last second,

08:29.620 --> 08:34.820
I think that's not a good decision because with time zones, with the way networks work,

08:34.820 --> 08:39.620
with sometimes companies really eager to pull the plug, I would not expect that this is going

08:39.620 --> 08:45.620
to work the entire length of the day, March 27th. So I really think this is the last week that those

08:45.620 --> 08:52.100
shops are open. If you have any 3DS or Wii U purchases that you want to get. And boy,

08:52.100 --> 08:56.820
some people want to make a lot of purchases. There's a YouTuber out there by the name,

08:56.820 --> 09:03.140
The Completionist. And he's been around the gaming media this week because he actually spent

09:03.140 --> 09:14.420
$22,791 getting every single digital title that's available on the Wii U and the 3DS. That's 866

09:14.420 --> 09:24.260
Wii U games and 1,547 3DS games, adding up to 1.2 terabytes of Wii U space and 267 gigabytes

09:24.260 --> 09:29.460
on the 3DS. Now, this isn't something he did all last night. This whole effort has taken about a

09:29.460 --> 09:34.580
year. I will defer to our pal, Bobby Blackwolf, who really went into the weeds tonight on his

09:34.580 --> 09:41.460
show about like what the banking restrictions are and what the prepaid cards are. And like,

09:41.460 --> 09:46.420
so all these roadblocks that stopped him and his team. It actually wasn't just him. It was

09:46.420 --> 09:51.060
his whole team from actually buying every game in one day. So my point is, if you're trying to do

09:51.060 --> 09:56.980
what The Completionist did tomorrow, it's too late. The restrictions that are in place with

09:56.980 --> 10:02.260
how much money you can drop before you're triggering security measures, it's too much.

10:02.260 --> 10:08.980
But if there are a few pieces of low hanging fruit, so to speak, or things that you can't get

10:08.980 --> 10:12.900
physically or whatever that you want to get, you know, this is the week to really think about it

10:12.900 --> 10:16.500
if you have either of those systems still connected. And I imagine more of you probably

10:16.500 --> 10:24.340
still have access to a 3DS pretty readily than you might the Wii U. Some suggestions to throw out

10:24.340 --> 10:30.100
there if you are looking for things on the 3DS, I would highly suggest go back and look at the 3D

10:30.100 --> 10:37.300
Classics catalog. Nintendo and Sega both did a round of some 3D classics, and they're very

10:37.380 --> 10:43.460
well done for what they are. I know Nintendo had a Kid Icarus one in there. They had some other

10:43.460 --> 10:48.020
games too. I don't remember if they had a Metroid. Excitebike, I think, was one of the other games

10:48.020 --> 10:51.060
that they did for 3DS. There were some others too. I'll look and chat in a minute here because

10:51.060 --> 10:56.820
you probably shout them out. But Sega did quite a few. They had Gunstar Heroes in the catalog,

10:56.820 --> 11:02.180
Sonic, several Sonic games. They had a lot lot in the catalog, and I would recommend those. I think

11:02.180 --> 11:08.660
it's actually a missed opportunity that those haven't been re-released, yes, in 2D form on the

11:08.660 --> 11:14.820
Switch. Especially in the case of the Nintendo ones. They souped up the classics without going

11:14.820 --> 11:20.100
in and doing a complete overhaul and calling them pixel remasters or whatever. They seemed

11:20.100 --> 11:26.260
pretty simple, so to speak, at the end of the day. Those would be some things I would recommend.

11:26.260 --> 11:32.020
I'm curious in chat, what would you all recommend for the Wii U and the 3DS for titles to go

11:32.500 --> 11:37.460
before they go away? I know, again, during Bobby's show, one suggestion that came up that I thought

11:37.460 --> 11:43.700
was really good would be the Pokemon Bank. If you want to be able to transfer, you will be able to

11:43.700 --> 11:48.260
re-download titles that you've downloaded in the past. Lord knows how much longer you'll be able

11:48.260 --> 11:54.180
to do that though. That won't be forever. But you can download things like Pokemon Bank and have

11:54.180 --> 12:01.540
that available to transfer 3DS Pokemon and DS Pokemon into a bank, which then you can transfer

12:01.620 --> 12:07.940
into home. That's how you get your Pokemon into modern games. And with that, I would say the 3DS

12:07.940 --> 12:14.020
re-release of things like Pokemon Yellow that actually had the Pokemon Transporter built into

12:14.020 --> 12:19.780
the old ROMs, which is pretty cool. So you can go catch an old Pikachu from a Game Boy game

12:19.780 --> 12:25.140
and transfer it all the way to Pokemon Scarlet. You could do that now. But you have to have all

12:25.140 --> 12:31.060
the systems set in place to be able to do that. Fixation Gaze in chat says, I recommend the

12:31.140 --> 12:36.100
Phoenix Wright series. It's the best on the 3DS. Yes. Now, I should also say there are

12:36.100 --> 12:41.780
quite a few 3DS and Wii U games that are getting remastered on Switch. We have seen a lot of those

12:41.780 --> 12:47.060
come back. I think with Phoenix Wright, we're more seeing newer titles. I know there's been a

12:47.060 --> 12:52.980
new one announced in that series. So keep an eye out for those. But yeah, certainly the classics,

12:52.980 --> 12:58.820
for sure. Dark Tetsuya suggests NES Remix. That is a great concept too. I'm surprised Nintendo has

12:58.820 --> 13:04.900
never revisited or re-released that title in any form. There were versions on the 3DS and the Wii

13:04.900 --> 13:09.860
U, if I remember right. I want to say the Wii U had a volume one and a volume two, and the 3DS

13:09.860 --> 13:15.620
had a retail release that was like a mishmash of both, like a best of from both. I would highly

13:15.620 --> 13:21.860
recommend those. SheHulk10 suggests Xenoblade X Chronicles only on Wii U. That's a really good

13:21.860 --> 13:27.060
one. Absolutely. That's a Xenoblade game they haven't brought on the Switch yet. I think they're

13:27.060 --> 13:33.460
saving it for the Switch's successor. But maybe that's just wishful thinking. Mike Devton chat

13:33.460 --> 13:41.140
suggests Rhythm Heaven Megamix for all my rhythm game enthusiasts. Bonds006 suggests Fire Emblem.

13:41.140 --> 13:48.580
I believe didn't the original Fire Emblem come out as a standalone on Switch eShop? I want to say

13:48.580 --> 13:51.620
that was the thing they announced during one of the directs because they did like a really expensive

13:51.700 --> 13:56.660
physical release for some reason of that too. I know there were certain

13:58.260 --> 14:03.140
games in the series that are there too, so certainly worth looking at as well.

14:03.140 --> 14:08.500
Mike Dev suggests Kirby's Adventure 3D. That was the definitive version of playing that game.

14:08.500 --> 14:15.300
sg100map backs up that the 3D classics are great. Gunstar Heroes, Streets of Rage, and Outrun to

14:15.300 --> 14:20.340
name a few. That's right. Outrun in the 3DS classics is really good. Really, really good.

14:20.340 --> 14:27.460
The thing is with a lot of those games though is I already have a bunch of them elsewhere.

14:28.500 --> 14:34.980
That would be for me my reason for not going after some of these. It's cool to have them

14:34.980 --> 14:44.980
on the console, but it's also extra money. Yeah, it is. I think what made the 3D versions

14:44.980 --> 14:48.900
unique would be, well, the 3D, you're not really going to get that a lot of other places. But they

14:48.900 --> 14:52.660
did. I don't remember the Sega classics particularly. Chat, you might have to back me

14:52.660 --> 14:57.060
up, but I know the Nintendo ones, they actually did enhance the original ROMs a little bit.

14:57.060 --> 15:01.220
Now, of course, if you want your experience pure, then this is actually going to be a turn

15:01.220 --> 15:05.780
off for you and not a reason to get it. For me, I thought it was a nice little fresh coat of paint

15:05.780 --> 15:10.580
on the old games. I liked what they did with that. I thought that was really cool. sg100map says,

15:10.580 --> 15:16.580
we'll likely not see anything 3D like this again. Don't see Nintendo revisiting 3D again. I agree

15:16.580 --> 15:22.980
with that. Remember 3D televisions? Those kind of came and went, didn't they? They barely do 3D

15:22.980 --> 15:28.900
movies anymore. I know they exist, but I feel like now it's 4D. Have you heard about this whole

15:28.900 --> 15:35.540
thing? People going to see Scream 6, and when people get killed, it splashes water to simulate

15:35.540 --> 15:40.740
blood. It's 4D stuff that they're doing now. 4D. The fourth dimension is time.

15:41.860 --> 15:45.860
Well, you know, that's what they call it. Hey, go back and watch Hypercube. It was a

15:45.940 --> 15:53.300
good movie. I didn't get my chance on the Star Trek Cruise. I'm very disappointed because Nicole

15:53.300 --> 15:58.580
DeBauer was there, and I wanted to say, I loved you in Cube, but I didn't get my chance because

15:59.460 --> 16:13.620
she also was the other Jax in season seven. But yeah, Jazita. I always butcher the names. Anyway,

16:14.180 --> 16:19.540
uh, Fixation Gaze says, I will say Universal was doing 4D way long ago in their parks for

16:19.540 --> 16:24.820
the Shrek rides. Yeah. So that's where, that's where the whole 4D phenomenon came from.

16:24.820 --> 16:31.380
But yeah. Oh, Tiger Claw says Super Mario movie will be in 3D. I know they still do 3D movies,

16:31.380 --> 16:37.700
but I feel like that's the theaters kind of shoehorning the technology that they paid all

16:37.700 --> 16:41.300
this money to implement and they're like refusing to walk away from it until they have to.

16:41.940 --> 16:47.540
Uh, I feel like it's not pushed as much as it used to be when like Avatar was new. I mean,

16:47.540 --> 16:53.380
the original Avatar was new, you know, that sort of thing. So, you know, my, my thing with,

16:53.380 --> 16:57.780
with 3D and cinema is that it needs to be there to enhance the movie and not a gimmick.

16:58.580 --> 17:03.540
Yeah. Yeah. And it's the same with, with, you know, if they bring back like that whole

17:03.540 --> 17:10.180
lenticular thing that the 3DS had or any other sort of, of 3D technology, it needs to be an

17:10.180 --> 17:16.900
enhancement and not a gimmick. Uh, dark to see us speaking of probably the most gimmicky 3D,

17:16.900 --> 17:22.580
or if I say 4D experience I've ever seen, the 3D I miss is like they did for Honey,

17:22.580 --> 17:26.580
I Shrunk the Audience. I don't know if they do that for movies anymore.

17:26.580 --> 17:31.860
Do not mess with that because it was Rick Moranis and Eric Idle.

17:33.460 --> 17:39.380
But remember, remember Honey I Shrunk the Audience was, was a thing, but I would say the

17:39.380 --> 17:45.860
first 4D was Captain EO before that, remember this Captain EO before that, that was the first 4D.

17:47.140 --> 17:52.580
I wish I had gone to the original Captain EO. I kind of am sad that I missed it, but I did like

17:52.580 --> 18:00.820
the revival, but it, I'm sorry, Captain EO is, is pinnacle, pinnacle.

18:00.820 --> 18:03.620
Yeah. It's, it's one of those things where it's like, I, I, I actually-

18:03.620 --> 18:05.860
Angelica Houston being a goddess. Hello.

18:05.860 --> 18:11.060
I still kind of believe Captain EO needs a place in Disney park somewhere. I understand they give

18:11.060 --> 18:15.060
it a lot of real estate, but I feel like Captain EO, they should do at least one showing a day.

18:15.060 --> 18:21.940
Like there's always like so many of us of a certain age, you know, despite however you feel

18:21.940 --> 18:27.940
about Michael Jackson at this point and everything, the thing is Captain EO is like-

18:27.940 --> 18:28.420
Amazing.

18:29.220 --> 18:29.940
It's childhood.

18:29.940 --> 18:30.980
Staple and icon.

18:30.980 --> 18:32.660
A staple, exactly.

18:32.660 --> 18:33.300
It's unique.

18:33.860 --> 18:35.140
It is unique.

18:35.140 --> 18:35.620
And thankfully-

18:35.620 --> 18:38.180
It's going to change the world. We are going to change the world.

18:38.980 --> 18:43.460
Some people, by the way, have gone in and done sort of their own remaster of it,

18:43.460 --> 18:47.860
where they combine the 3D elements into a single, you know, 2D experience,

18:47.860 --> 18:49.220
and the whole thing is up on YouTube.

18:49.860 --> 18:52.180
Oh yeah. I'm, I'm, that one's, I'm pretty sure-

18:52.180 --> 18:53.940
I go back and watch it at least once a month.

18:54.660 --> 18:57.700
I'm pretty sure Honey I Shrunk the Audience is all on YouTube as well at this point,

18:57.700 --> 19:00.260
you know, fan cams basically, but it's there.

19:00.260 --> 19:04.660
I have two things that I go back and watch at least once a month, three, sorry, three.

19:04.660 --> 19:06.100
One of them is Captain EO.

19:06.100 --> 19:10.660
The other one is Interstellar 5555.

19:11.620 --> 19:13.380
And the other one is the Princess Bride.

19:14.340 --> 19:15.220
Inconceivable.

19:16.740 --> 19:18.100
You keep saying that word.

19:18.100 --> 19:19.220
Do you even know what it means?

19:20.180 --> 19:21.940
No, I do not think it means what you think it means.

19:24.260 --> 19:27.620
Back to the topic we were talking about, Wii U and 3DS.

19:27.620 --> 19:28.900
So the stores are closing.

19:28.900 --> 19:31.940
I'm curious for my co-hosts, is there anything you're going to miss?

19:31.940 --> 19:34.820
Or are you just kind of like, let it, let, let it die.

19:35.860 --> 19:36.580
Let it die.

19:38.100 --> 19:42.420
For me, I mean, this is one of those things that seems inevitable in this day and age,

19:42.420 --> 19:47.620
but obviously there is hurt feelings because for game preservation,

19:47.620 --> 19:51.140
this stinks because there were so many digital only titles.

19:51.140 --> 19:58.100
And what we see Nintendo doing is not what we see Microsoft or even to some extent Sony doing,

19:58.100 --> 20:03.060
which is having that digital catalog be available when you buy a new system,

20:03.060 --> 20:05.140
thanks to backwards compatibility.

20:05.140 --> 20:10.180
You know, I think we can all cross our fingers and hope and pray thoughts, prayers, rainbows,

20:10.180 --> 20:14.820
wishes, whatever you want to, that there's going to be something on the future Nintendo

20:14.820 --> 20:20.020
console, but I'm not going to hold my breath with that whole thing.

20:21.460 --> 20:26.500
And so that's the part that's kind of sad is that these games will essentially be lost to time.

20:26.500 --> 20:32.340
Although with preservationist efforts, like what, you know, this YouTuber did in

20:32.340 --> 20:34.100
downloading the entire archive.

20:34.100 --> 20:43.140
And let's be real, the ethical question of is piracy and emulation an ethical thing to do?

20:43.140 --> 20:48.660
That argument changes significantly once the stores are closed and literally your ability

20:48.660 --> 20:51.780
to buy these games and pay money for them goes away.

20:51.780 --> 20:53.860
And I'll let you fill in the gaps with what I'm saying.

20:54.820 --> 20:56.340
But it's, oh, go ahead.

20:57.060 --> 21:00.900
I was going to say if things lately have taught me anything,

21:00.900 --> 21:03.060
it's that ethics are subjective these days.

21:04.020 --> 21:04.520
True.

21:06.980 --> 21:09.860
And I would just say like, if I'm going to play these games,

21:09.860 --> 21:13.300
I do not feel bad about emulating them after March 27th.

21:14.020 --> 21:21.060
Well, and the thing about it to also add is that the intent and the impact are two different

21:21.060 --> 21:21.560
things.

21:22.180 --> 21:29.780
And if the overall, if the intent is good and the impact comes out positively, then yeah, great.

21:29.780 --> 21:36.820
But you can always have good intent and have the end result come out pretty shitty.

21:38.020 --> 21:40.820
And of course, as far as what that end result is going to be,

21:40.820 --> 21:43.780
that is going to be another subjective thing.

21:43.780 --> 21:47.380
Nintendo might see it one way, we as the public will see it another.

21:47.380 --> 21:51.940
What's going to be the prevailing thought?

21:51.940 --> 21:52.440
Okay.

21:53.460 --> 21:56.660
Fixation Gays in Chat says, once you cannot buy it legitimately,

21:56.660 --> 21:58.260
it's out the window, honestly.

21:58.260 --> 21:59.460
Yeah, I agree with that.

22:00.020 --> 22:00.900
That's my theory.

22:00.900 --> 22:02.020
I agree with that.

22:02.020 --> 22:10.340
But I mean, again, we're looking at honestly, I think that if they're going to take it off

22:10.340 --> 22:14.820
of the market, they know there's going to be a quote, black market.

22:15.620 --> 22:19.860
Some people, and to be fair, some people, and they have a right to this opinion,

22:19.860 --> 22:24.980
say that no, you're still not in an ethically good place by doing that.

22:24.980 --> 22:29.380
Because this is similar to how Disney used to vault, I'll come back to the minute,

22:29.380 --> 22:31.060
used to vault their old movies.

22:31.060 --> 22:31.540
Remember that?

22:31.540 --> 22:36.100
You had to buy that movie on VHS in the little clamshell case, and it would go back into

22:36.100 --> 22:38.980
the Disney vault as of whatever date.

22:38.980 --> 22:43.540
You can never buy it again, or they'd be up to collectors sky high.

22:43.620 --> 22:48.420
But, important footnote, Disney came around eventually.

22:48.420 --> 22:51.620
Once the technology was in place, guess what Disney Plus offers?

22:52.420 --> 22:53.380
There's no more vault.

22:53.380 --> 22:58.180
You can watch everything on Disney Plus, except for the controversial ones, you know,

22:58.180 --> 23:00.660
the things that Disney is not going to put out, period.

23:00.660 --> 23:06.740
They think should be released as a teaching element.

23:06.740 --> 23:12.180
Yeah, because if I didn't say that, someone would, but otherwise, for the most part,

23:12.580 --> 23:17.300
those titles are open and available on Disney Plus as far as things like The Little Mermaid

23:17.300 --> 23:20.020
to Snow White to Treasure Planet and whatever.

23:21.460 --> 23:23.700
They're all available on Disney Plus at this point.

23:23.700 --> 23:25.460
So finally, they came around eventually.

23:25.460 --> 23:30.100
And the reason why I say that is because maybe someday, Nintendo does the same thing.

23:30.100 --> 23:30.580
Maybe.

23:30.580 --> 23:31.940
Maybe Disney shows that as well.

23:32.580 --> 23:36.420
DGRMS says, I have a bunch of those clamshell VHS Disney movies.

23:36.420 --> 23:40.260
Those clamshells are icons of the 80s and 90s, as far as I'm concerned.

23:40.980 --> 23:42.500
Those are icons of the 80s.

23:42.500 --> 23:43.220
So you know what?

23:43.220 --> 23:46.340
They're still collector values and things like that.

23:46.340 --> 23:51.220
So I wish that I had still had my copy of Peach Dragon.

23:51.220 --> 23:55.300
I mean, it's since come out on DVD, but for the longest time, the only way you could get

23:55.300 --> 23:57.300
that was on VHS.

23:57.300 --> 23:59.780
And I loved that movie as a kid.

23:59.780 --> 24:00.740
I love Helen Reddy.

24:00.740 --> 24:02.660
That was the movie that made me love Helen Reddy.

24:03.940 --> 24:04.820
All right.

24:04.820 --> 24:09.620
Well, while we reminisce, let's take a moment and reminisce our past week as we talk about

24:09.620 --> 24:13.140
our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing this week.

24:13.140 --> 24:14.980
So Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

24:16.260 --> 24:17.140
Pretty eventful.

24:20.660 --> 24:24.180
Of course, I played a lot of Dead by Daylight, and I played it with Fixy.

24:24.180 --> 24:24.900
Hi, Fixy.

24:27.220 --> 24:28.420
And Gwen and Shayla.

24:29.060 --> 24:31.780
You have a little squad now I always see you playing with.

24:31.780 --> 24:34.500
We call ourselves Team Yeet.

24:34.500 --> 24:35.060
Team Yeet.

24:35.060 --> 24:36.580
Yeah, I lurk.

24:36.580 --> 24:37.060
I lurk.

24:37.620 --> 24:39.060
You don't know I'm there, but I'm there.

24:39.620 --> 24:46.020
And there is a video on YouTube of the origin day of Team Yeet and a farming ghost face.

24:48.900 --> 24:51.060
But yeah, we do our thing.

24:52.340 --> 24:55.860
I actually adapted Sadako on Sunday.

24:56.900 --> 25:02.180
And I don't know if it was because I remembered all of my skills very suddenly or I had a

25:02.180 --> 25:03.220
bunch of flops.

25:03.220 --> 25:08.580
It was probably a combination of both, but I got my Sadako adapt without really trying.

25:09.620 --> 25:16.260
That's five out of how many killers now I still need to regain my...

25:16.260 --> 25:17.860
I've got all the survivors adapted.

25:19.300 --> 25:22.260
I played a lot of Marvel Midnight Suns.

25:22.260 --> 25:27.860
I played it on stream last night because I learned that my controller is incompatible

25:27.860 --> 25:29.140
with my SNES emulator.

25:30.820 --> 25:34.660
I have actually ordered a controller specifically for my SNES emulator.

25:35.620 --> 25:40.180
And again, I can legally play these games on stream because I own the original Super

25:40.180 --> 25:41.460
Famicom cartridges.

25:41.460 --> 25:41.860
The end.

25:42.500 --> 25:44.100
So yeah, Letterman jackets.

25:44.100 --> 25:45.460
We're going to do Letterman jackets.

25:48.260 --> 25:49.380
Ranja, I don't remember.

25:49.380 --> 25:54.180
I'll tell you offline for what controller I ordered.

25:54.740 --> 25:58.260
But at any rate, I also played a bunch of pinball.

25:58.260 --> 26:03.540
And I got into a very fun discussion about pinball with the one and only Brianna Wu.

26:04.660 --> 26:08.980
We're online friends now.

26:10.020 --> 26:12.820
And I am hoping that I actually get to play pinball with her.

26:12.820 --> 26:14.340
I think that would be absolutely fun.

26:14.900 --> 26:16.260
She's got quite the collection.

26:16.260 --> 26:17.380
I was very impressed.

26:17.380 --> 26:18.900
Isn't she on the other coast?

26:18.900 --> 26:21.460
Didn't she run for office out in Maryland or something?

26:22.180 --> 26:23.540
Well, I mean, things happen.

26:23.540 --> 26:28.740
I mean, if there's a convention or anything, I'm still planning on going out that way.

26:29.700 --> 26:33.620
Paxis is this weekend, speaking of that part of the country.

26:33.620 --> 26:37.380
I know, but it just reminded me, Paxis is this weekend.

26:38.100 --> 26:43.540
But we talked pinball, and I really want to play the Halloween pinball.

26:43.540 --> 26:44.500
And she's got one.

26:45.140 --> 26:45.860
I want to play it.

26:46.820 --> 26:50.420
But I've been playing a lot of Beatles Mania and World Cup Soccer, because World Cup Soccer

26:50.420 --> 26:51.060
is my favorite.

26:53.220 --> 26:57.140
I also have been playing my stupid word game.

26:58.100 --> 27:04.260
It's sad when I can solve one of the, quote, super hard puzzles in 20 seconds.

27:05.860 --> 27:08.100
And what else did I do?

27:08.100 --> 27:15.460
Oh, yeah, I played a little Jackie Crush, the last in the Crush series.

27:15.460 --> 27:16.260
We had Alien Crush.

27:16.260 --> 27:17.140
Oh, yeah.

27:17.140 --> 27:18.260
You've highlighted that before.

27:18.260 --> 27:20.500
I'm almost positive in the classic game segment.

27:20.500 --> 27:26.500
Jackie Crush is the SNES one, which is the final entry in the Crush series of pinball

27:26.500 --> 27:26.820
games.

27:27.540 --> 27:28.580
I just like how it starts.

27:28.580 --> 27:30.180
You have all the demon faces that scroll out.

27:30.180 --> 27:31.460
It goes, Jackie Crush.

27:33.220 --> 27:35.140
And what else did I play?

27:35.140 --> 27:38.340
Because I played other stuff, and I don't remember.

27:39.780 --> 27:42.340
Yeah, I think that that might be it.

27:44.580 --> 27:46.260
Yeah, I can't remember what else.

27:46.260 --> 27:49.060
I know that there was something else on my list, but I don't remember.

27:49.060 --> 27:49.940
So fuck it.

27:52.100 --> 27:54.100
I played a lot of Dead by Daylight.

27:54.820 --> 27:57.940
All right, let's go over to Loki.

27:57.940 --> 27:59.220
How is your gaming week?

27:59.220 --> 28:00.420
It's just Minecraft.

28:01.220 --> 28:02.740
Still working on my project.

28:02.740 --> 28:07.940
I finally got to the part where I'm actually filming stuff and building in the SMP now.

28:07.940 --> 28:12.900
So hoping to have an episode out very soon, because it's been a very long time.

28:12.900 --> 28:14.420
What happened with the Minecraft contest?

28:14.420 --> 28:16.100
Because wasn't that over on the 15th?

28:16.100 --> 28:18.420
Yeah, the cutoff was on the 15th.

28:18.420 --> 28:19.780
They haven't announced anything yet.

28:19.780 --> 28:20.820
Oh, okay.

28:20.820 --> 28:22.500
So they're just taking their time.

28:23.220 --> 28:23.720
Fair.

28:24.820 --> 28:26.420
So probably this week sometime.

28:26.420 --> 28:26.740
All right.

28:26.740 --> 28:30.020
Well, still crossing my fingers for you, even if it's just a shout out.

28:30.020 --> 28:32.340
Hey, it's still an acknowledgement.

28:32.340 --> 28:33.940
It's a senpai notice me moment.

28:33.940 --> 28:34.900
So it's fine.

28:35.940 --> 28:37.140
Anything else for your gaming week?

28:37.780 --> 28:38.500
No, that's it.

28:39.380 --> 28:42.420
I end up stuff on the Steam sale that I probably will buy and not play.

28:43.300 --> 28:45.780
I keep forgetting that there was a Steam sale that just started.

28:45.780 --> 28:46.740
Oh, that's dangerous.

28:46.740 --> 28:47.540
All right.

28:47.540 --> 28:51.220
Yeah, I keep seeing Final Fantasy VII integrate in there.

28:51.300 --> 28:54.420
I was like, sure.

28:55.940 --> 28:57.220
Maybe I've been watching Alan.

28:57.220 --> 29:00.100
Alan's been doing some streaming of that on his channel.

29:00.100 --> 29:05.940
And his whole thing now is he mods games and streams them with the mods.

29:05.940 --> 29:07.940
And I suppose I should shout out my husband here.

29:07.940 --> 29:09.860
He's going to do a stream on Tuesday.

29:09.860 --> 29:12.660
So he's been playing Mass Effect 2 modded.

29:13.700 --> 29:17.220
And sorry, Jamie, I think this conflicts with one of your streams, but Alan's been working

29:17.220 --> 29:17.860
very hard on this.

29:17.860 --> 29:18.500
I'm going to plug it.

29:19.140 --> 29:26.020
He's going to beat Mass Effect 2 modded on Tuesday at 10 30 Eastern and do the ending

29:26.020 --> 29:26.340
sequence.

29:26.340 --> 29:30.740
But what's special about it, he's been modding it so that he can romance Thane because there's

29:30.740 --> 29:35.380
actually dialogue, I guess, that is there that was not in the actual release.

29:35.380 --> 29:42.100
So Thane was romanceable by a lady in Mass Effect 2, but not by a male character.

29:42.100 --> 29:45.380
This mod has unlocked the male and Thane romance.

29:45.380 --> 29:49.620
So he's going to show that on stream on Tuesday and beat the game, which, of course, what's

29:49.620 --> 29:49.780
that?

29:50.420 --> 29:51.220
It was dialogue?

29:51.220 --> 29:51.700
Yeah.

29:51.700 --> 29:55.540
Apparently there was dialogue like there was in the first game for a Kaiden male romance.

29:56.340 --> 29:58.420
Something like that where there's ghost dialogue or something.

29:58.420 --> 30:01.780
So yeah, like it was in there and then coded out.

30:01.780 --> 30:03.060
Yep, exactly.

30:03.060 --> 30:06.660
So thanks to modders.

30:06.660 --> 30:07.140
It's back.

30:07.140 --> 30:08.820
So that's something he's going to be doing on Tuesday.

30:08.820 --> 30:12.500
And if there's just so many streams you want to watch and you can't choose, he'll be happy

30:12.500 --> 30:13.460
if you watch the VOD.

30:13.460 --> 30:15.140
So and that'll all be highlighted as well.

30:15.140 --> 30:17.220
So there's that.

30:17.220 --> 30:18.180
So let's see.

30:18.180 --> 30:20.980
Otherwise, my gaming week, the types of games I've been playing, streaming, whatever it

30:20.980 --> 30:21.140
is.

30:21.700 --> 30:23.300
Theatrhythm continuing on with that.

30:23.300 --> 30:25.460
The World Ends With You DLC came out this week.

30:25.460 --> 30:27.220
I streamed a little bit of that earlier this week.

30:27.780 --> 30:28.660
Really good music.

30:28.660 --> 30:30.820
And I'm not super familiar with that series.

30:30.820 --> 30:33.700
I have to admit, like, I'm familiar that it exists.

30:33.700 --> 30:35.940
I just didn't really play them start to finish.

30:35.940 --> 30:37.300
There's some really good songs in that.

30:37.300 --> 30:39.380
There's some bangers in that game.

30:39.380 --> 30:42.020
So I was really happy with the DLC for Theatrhythm.

30:42.020 --> 30:43.300
I've been playing a little bit of that.

30:43.940 --> 30:47.620
I also continuing just a little bit of Dead by Daylight, not as much as Dark Sakura, but

30:47.620 --> 30:50.020
maybe a game a day or something like that.

30:50.020 --> 30:52.660
Just to keep my skills up to speed.

30:52.660 --> 30:53.780
I remembered my other game.

30:53.780 --> 30:54.660
I played Among Us.

30:55.300 --> 30:56.020
Oh, that's right.

30:56.020 --> 30:57.220
You've been getting into that lately.

30:58.100 --> 31:01.700
I've been playing with Raven McPherson, Arty, and all them.

31:01.700 --> 31:02.740
Yeah, yeah.

31:02.740 --> 31:05.220
So I didn't mean to cut you off, but I just remembered.

31:05.220 --> 31:08.980
Mike Def says, glad they included with World Ends With You some of the songs in Neo.

31:08.980 --> 31:11.540
Yeah, it's three from the original and three from Neo.

31:11.540 --> 31:13.620
So it's some good round of DLC.

31:13.620 --> 31:14.340
I enjoyed it.

31:14.340 --> 31:17.220
Very much looking forward to the Nier DLC, which will be next week.

31:17.860 --> 31:19.700
So definitely will play that as well.

31:20.580 --> 31:22.900
I've also been playing No Man's Sky.

31:22.900 --> 31:26.100
I'm really close to finishing the expedition if I hadn't.

31:26.100 --> 31:30.100
So unfortunately, I fucked myself on stream.

31:30.100 --> 31:31.220
Not in that kind of way.

31:31.220 --> 31:31.860
Really?

31:31.860 --> 31:33.140
I'm not talking about an OF.

31:33.140 --> 31:39.220
I'm talking about when you get yourself into a logic problem live on stream and the logic

31:39.220 --> 31:46.580
problem was in No Man's Sky, the logic problem was you can only craft material at your base

31:46.580 --> 31:48.260
in this latest mission.

31:48.260 --> 31:52.900
I landed on a planet and I landed and I was out of starship fuel.

31:52.900 --> 31:57.540
I could not craft more starship fuel because I was nowhere near my base.

31:58.100 --> 32:01.780
I would have had to have walked four hours on the planet to get to my base.

32:02.420 --> 32:09.540
So what I had to do, I had to construct an all new base in order to build the starship

32:09.540 --> 32:11.380
fuel so I could take off.

32:11.380 --> 32:15.060
So Quest Buster says I'm a little halfway through that expedition.

32:15.060 --> 32:18.580
So learn from Uncle Rob what not to do.

32:18.580 --> 32:21.220
And here's how to get yourself out of those situations.

32:21.220 --> 32:26.660
So Quest Buster, always keep the material on you to build one extra base.

32:27.300 --> 32:31.460
And it's a lot of chromatic metal and a lot because they amped it up from what it normally

32:31.860 --> 32:34.500
costs next to nothing to build a computer base.

32:34.500 --> 32:41.140
But this time they amped it up to like 250 chromatic metal and like 500 ferret dust or

32:41.140 --> 32:41.460
something.

32:42.820 --> 32:44.500
It's like magnetized ferret or something.

32:44.500 --> 32:45.460
It's enhanced.

32:45.460 --> 32:51.940
So always keep the material on you so that you don't screw yourself over like I did.

32:51.940 --> 32:56.420
Because if I hadn't done that and had to spend 45 minutes fixing that situation I got myself

32:56.420 --> 32:58.900
in, I probably would have beat on stream.

32:58.900 --> 33:04.260
So yeah, Quest Buster says I ran into a similar problem early on when I remembered that I

33:04.260 --> 33:07.060
could only craft near a base and I was kind of far away.

33:07.060 --> 33:12.580
As long as you keep the mats on you for a base at all times, you can always just craft

33:12.580 --> 33:13.300
a new base.

33:13.300 --> 33:17.300
It doesn't have to be the base that the game sends you to in that expedition.

33:17.300 --> 33:18.340
That's something I learned.

33:18.340 --> 33:22.020
So by the way, that expedition only has two or three weeks left in it.

33:22.020 --> 33:24.660
So if you haven't started it yet, I would highly encourage you to.

33:24.660 --> 33:27.060
And I believe the Switch has expeditions now.

33:28.020 --> 33:31.940
Some of you on the Switch may have to tell me if I'm wrong on that, but I'm pretty sure

33:31.940 --> 33:36.740
they added that with the big VR update that pushed for PlayStation is that Switch now

33:36.740 --> 33:37.300
has expeditions.

33:37.300 --> 33:39.460
Actually, it might have been before that for the encores.

33:39.460 --> 33:41.620
So Switch, you can do the expeditions on.

33:41.620 --> 33:46.420
So other big important one that I left out of my game a week.

33:46.420 --> 33:50.020
I got to talk about this because I played so much of it this weekend.

33:50.020 --> 33:51.860
I'm probably going cross-eyed.

33:51.860 --> 33:59.220
And that is, I played the shit out of the Diablo 4 beta, which that went up this weekend

33:59.220 --> 34:05.060
for those that either pre-ordered the game, which was me, or stomach to KFC Double Down,

34:05.620 --> 34:06.660
which is other people.

34:07.300 --> 34:09.620
Was it good or did it Diablo?

34:10.260 --> 34:12.420
It is fantastic.

34:13.140 --> 34:15.700
It is fantastic.

34:15.700 --> 34:18.580
I am so hyped for Diablo.

34:18.580 --> 34:24.980
So I may have had an inkling that this game was already in good shape because there was

34:24.980 --> 34:25.860
a closed beta.

34:25.860 --> 34:30.020
I can't say I was in the if I was in the closed beta, I'm not allowed to say I was.

34:32.100 --> 34:36.260
But now that there's an open beta, we can be open and talk a little more about Diablo

34:36.260 --> 34:37.620
4 and what's so great about it.

34:38.500 --> 34:44.660
I think if you were put off by Diablo 3 in some ways, I think this is the sequel you

34:44.660 --> 34:50.740
wanted to Diablo 2, because Diablo 2, there's a lot more of Diablo 2's roots in this game

34:50.740 --> 34:54.820
in the way that it's, not to say, because I love Diablo 3 and I still love this one

34:54.820 --> 35:02.820
because there's a lot of quality of life stuff that Diablo 3 brought in that now is in Diablo

35:02.820 --> 35:03.300
4.

35:03.300 --> 35:04.500
But they do different things.

35:04.500 --> 35:09.620
Now it's like the open world and they have all these different systems and the storytelling

35:09.620 --> 35:12.020
they have really amped up.

35:12.020 --> 35:14.180
That was most impressive to me.

35:14.180 --> 35:19.060
The way they do some of the artistic directions and the cut scenes and stuff is like stuff

35:19.060 --> 35:19.780
in The Witcher.

35:19.780 --> 35:20.660
It's really good.

35:21.540 --> 35:26.020
So this game has been in development forever, but it's showing.

35:27.060 --> 35:32.340
All of these different dungeons that you do, although yes, there's only so many background

35:32.340 --> 35:36.820
patterns you see in a Diablo game, it's varied enough, these dungeons, to feel like you're

35:36.820 --> 35:38.020
doing something new.

35:38.020 --> 35:41.540
I played multiplayer with some other people that were in the open beta.

35:41.540 --> 35:43.220
It played very well.

35:43.220 --> 35:50.020
My only concern was that I got some really bad graphics stuttering playing on high-end

35:50.020 --> 35:52.180
graphics on my less than a year old computer.

35:52.900 --> 35:55.780
However, when I turned it down to medium, it was fine.

35:55.780 --> 36:00.260
It is a beta, and those are the types of problems that are usually present in a beta.

36:00.260 --> 36:05.060
So I'm not like, I've already dropped the $100 for the Super Mega Deluxe Edition of

36:05.060 --> 36:05.620
this game.

36:05.620 --> 36:08.740
So look, this doesn't, they've already got me.

36:08.740 --> 36:12.340
I have no room to judge, given that I paid 100 for Midnight Suns.

36:13.060 --> 36:13.860
There's, yeah.

36:13.860 --> 36:18.820
So look, any little complaints I have here, or if you're going to go, well, it's just

36:18.820 --> 36:19.460
a beta, Rob.

36:19.460 --> 36:20.260
You shouldn't judge again.

36:20.260 --> 36:25.300
No, I did not judge the game because I've paid a lot of money for the full retail release

36:25.300 --> 36:26.660
of this game already.

36:26.660 --> 36:29.140
So, but yeah.

36:30.660 --> 36:33.140
Questbuster in chat says the world boss is horrifying.

36:33.140 --> 36:36.500
I saw, I haven't seen the world boss, but I have seen world quests, and that's a new

36:36.500 --> 36:37.380
thing to Diablo.

36:37.380 --> 36:41.380
They actually put in MMO-like elements, but it's not an MMO.

36:42.020 --> 36:43.140
It's weird.

36:43.140 --> 36:46.420
Like, it's seamless for Diablo.

36:46.420 --> 36:47.700
It works really well.

36:47.700 --> 36:54.740
The open beta is next weekend, and you don't need a KFC Double Down, so I would encourage

36:54.740 --> 36:58.100
if you're curious about it, check out the open beta next weekend.

36:58.100 --> 37:01.300
It's only going to be three days, but that's your chance to see if it's for you or not.

37:02.100 --> 37:03.940
Bobby Blackwolf says, are there colors?

37:03.940 --> 37:04.500
Actually, yeah.

37:04.500 --> 37:08.420
I know the game has been getting a little bit of flack because the overworld, the open

37:08.500 --> 37:13.860
world is mostly a snowy world, so it's very plain white, snowed out, but when you start

37:13.860 --> 37:18.580
to get into some of the dungeons that are shiny and have the metallic effects and the

37:18.580 --> 37:22.420
fountains of blood, because this is a Diablo game, and it is nasty.

37:22.420 --> 37:28.260
I'm not a big violent, so there are parts of this game that make me go, ugh, but those

37:28.260 --> 37:29.780
are only in the cutscenes.

37:29.780 --> 37:35.140
Usually as you're playing the game, the camera's pulled back so far, you don't see graphic,

37:35.140 --> 37:36.180
graphic violence.

37:36.180 --> 37:36.900
It's implied.

37:36.900 --> 37:38.180
It's all implied.

37:38.180 --> 37:39.220
When you're playing the game.

37:39.220 --> 37:41.780
In cutscenes, it's more than implied.

37:43.460 --> 37:47.220
So I will caution, but you can skip cutscenes if you are not interested in that.

37:47.220 --> 37:48.900
You just want to click a lot and get loot.

37:49.540 --> 37:50.340
There is that.

37:50.340 --> 37:55.700
So Dark Tetsuya says, I'll probably get it on console, especially if the console versions

37:55.700 --> 37:57.060
have local co-op.

37:57.060 --> 37:58.420
I believe they do.

37:58.420 --> 38:02.740
I'm not, don't quote me on that, but I'll tell you what it did have even during this

38:02.740 --> 38:06.980
beta and will have in the full release that the other games needed badly.

38:06.980 --> 38:07.780
Crossplay.

38:08.660 --> 38:10.500
So remember I said I partied with friends.

38:10.500 --> 38:12.660
I played with Shane and Xtavor and Xtavor's husband.

38:13.380 --> 38:18.660
Myself, Xtavor's husband, and I think Xtavor were all on PC, but Shane was on PS5 and we

38:18.660 --> 38:20.100
all played together seamlessly.

38:20.100 --> 38:23.940
And thanks to the PS5 Discord integration, we were all on a Discord call.

38:23.940 --> 38:32.900
So yeah, it's 2023, we are eating good in 2023 when it comes to video games.

38:33.460 --> 38:36.660
Honestly, if it was just Diablo 4, I would be like, this is it.

38:36.660 --> 38:39.380
This is the game I'm going to play more than any other this year.

38:39.380 --> 38:40.420
I can't say that.

38:41.060 --> 38:45.220
Theat rhythms already come out and you see I played too much of that as it is.

38:46.020 --> 38:51.300
There is also, Zelda has that sequel coming out this year, Tears of the Kingdom.

38:51.300 --> 38:53.300
That's like out two weeks before Diablo.

38:53.300 --> 38:56.420
Three weeks after Diablo, Final Fantasy 16.

38:56.420 --> 38:59.460
Later this winter, supposedly, Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth.

39:00.020 --> 39:01.620
And that's just the tip of the iceberg.

39:02.420 --> 39:07.540
This year is going to be unprecedented for the level of games that we're getting.

39:07.540 --> 39:13.140
And if these other games have the quality of Diablo 4 and the polish that three years

39:13.140 --> 39:17.540
of a pandemic and working extra long on the game has brought, holy shit.

39:18.740 --> 39:22.340
Yeah, and folks in chat, Mike Deff says Street Fighter 6.

39:22.340 --> 39:26.180
Bobby Blackwolf says Hi-Fi Rush, already a surprise hit coming.

39:26.180 --> 39:28.580
You're right, we don't even know the surprise hits that are coming.

39:29.060 --> 39:31.460
This is a year.

39:32.100 --> 39:35.940
And then that doesn't even count games we can't stop playing.

39:36.660 --> 39:38.100
Dead by Daylight, Dark Sakura.

39:38.980 --> 39:41.620
Or Final Fantasy 14, self-call out.

39:41.620 --> 39:43.780
You know, or Minecraft, Loki call out.

39:43.780 --> 39:49.140
Whatever it is, there are still games that we still keep playing because they keep patching

39:49.140 --> 39:50.980
them, enhancing them, and making them good.

39:50.980 --> 39:53.940
Oh my God, Quest Buster reminded me, Starfield.

39:55.700 --> 39:56.660
I have to quit my job.

39:58.900 --> 40:00.420
Just kidding.

40:00.420 --> 40:01.220
I love my job.

40:01.220 --> 40:01.700
I really do.

40:01.700 --> 40:03.140
And that's what pays for games.

40:03.140 --> 40:05.220
But when am I going to have the time to do it?

40:05.220 --> 40:06.100
I just, I'm not.

40:10.180 --> 40:12.980
So this is, you are cracking me the hell up.

40:12.980 --> 40:13.480
Why?

40:14.420 --> 40:16.180
Just because you're being so funny.

40:16.180 --> 40:16.900
But it's true.

40:16.900 --> 40:20.980
This is such a good year to be excited about video games.

40:20.980 --> 40:24.980
There's just, there really is something for everyone this year in particular.

40:24.980 --> 40:26.820
And I don't know what it is about this year.

40:26.820 --> 40:27.620
It really is there.

40:27.620 --> 40:29.140
They're still yelling them off in chat.

40:29.140 --> 40:30.660
Exo Primal coming out.

40:31.460 --> 40:33.620
Persona rereleases coming out.

40:33.620 --> 40:37.860
Cyberpunk, for those that got into that, is going to be getting, I believe, an expansion.

40:37.860 --> 40:39.860
Octopath Traveler 2 just came out.

40:39.860 --> 40:41.940
This is a great year for games.

40:43.380 --> 40:44.180
Shedding a tear.

40:44.180 --> 40:44.980
Yeah.

40:44.980 --> 40:45.480
All right.

40:46.180 --> 40:46.660
But yes.

40:46.660 --> 40:48.740
Will your heart go on, Rob?

40:49.540 --> 40:50.900
Near, far, wherever you are.

40:51.460 --> 40:54.020
But Diablo 4, yes.

40:54.740 --> 40:57.380
Bolded, underlined, italicized.

40:57.380 --> 40:58.100
I'm excited.

40:59.060 --> 41:00.660
So there it is.

41:00.660 --> 41:01.460
All right.

41:01.460 --> 41:01.940
Yes.

41:01.940 --> 41:05.860
Actually, the open beta this weekend didn't even have Druid or Necromancer in it.

41:05.860 --> 41:07.780
Those will be in the beta next weekend.

41:07.780 --> 41:12.500
So I fully expect that everybody's going to be Druid or Necromancer or the people that

41:12.500 --> 41:15.220
didn't play this weekend that are finally getting around to doing Sorcerer or whatever

41:15.220 --> 41:15.620
they pick.

41:15.620 --> 41:20.420
So it's going to be an interesting, by the way, your progress in the beta does not carry

41:20.420 --> 41:28.260
over to the live game, except if you get to level 20 in the beta, you get a wolf doggy

41:28.260 --> 41:31.220
that you carry around with you in your little backpack.

41:31.220 --> 41:32.900
It's a cosmetic reward.

41:32.900 --> 41:39.620
So I'm trying to show an image of what that looks like here.

41:39.620 --> 41:40.820
So we're live on Twitch.

41:42.500 --> 41:43.220
I found one.

41:43.220 --> 41:44.420
How do I get it to come up here?

41:46.100 --> 41:46.820
Sorry.

41:46.820 --> 41:48.420
Very excited about the whole thing.

41:48.420 --> 41:49.140
I'm doing live.

41:50.020 --> 41:54.660
I've been waiting for this game a very, very long time, and it's finally here, and I'm

41:54.660 --> 41:55.540
very excited.

41:56.100 --> 42:00.900
This is not the best representation as we're live, because I can't get the gift to play

42:00.900 --> 42:01.380
any larger.

42:01.380 --> 42:02.180
Oh, maybe I do that.

42:02.180 --> 42:02.680
There we go.

42:03.460 --> 42:08.020
It's actually a little wolf dog that sleeps in a little cradle in your back.

42:08.020 --> 42:10.500
That is the reward you get for getting to level 20, right?

42:11.620 --> 42:12.660
Oh, my God.

42:12.660 --> 42:14.980
I don't even like Diablo, and I want to play this now.

42:15.860 --> 42:18.660
Here's the thing, and this is the dangerous part.

42:18.660 --> 42:23.700
Because Diablo four, they're not supposed to be doing the same stuff they did with Immortal

42:23.700 --> 42:25.780
where it's all because Immortal was a free to play game.

42:25.780 --> 42:26.500
That's old news.

42:27.380 --> 42:31.620
The experience you buy it and whatever, it's all in one, but they're still going to be

42:31.620 --> 42:34.660
doing battle passes and all that stuff for cosmetics.

42:35.300 --> 42:36.740
But here's the thing.

42:36.740 --> 42:38.660
Diablo kills it with cosmetics.

42:39.220 --> 42:40.180
Case and point.

42:40.180 --> 42:44.900
What I just showed, like, there are lots of people like Dark Sakura, lots of people that

42:44.900 --> 42:49.140
are like, I wasn't caring about Diablo until you showed me that.

42:50.420 --> 42:52.180
Honestly, it's still not enough for me to play it.

42:53.620 --> 42:53.940
Fine.

42:56.020 --> 42:58.100
But I seriously had the thought.

42:58.100 --> 42:59.060
You had the thought.

43:00.100 --> 43:01.620
You had an impure thought.

43:02.900 --> 43:03.700
I did.

43:03.700 --> 43:07.700
That just moment of absolute weakness was like,

43:07.700 --> 43:14.580
All right, let's see.

43:14.580 --> 43:18.900
We're going to move on and get into some other stuff that's going on in the gaming world

43:18.900 --> 43:21.060
and talk about what's up in news this week.

43:21.060 --> 43:24.980
First, though, I want to address this because we had a redeem.

43:24.980 --> 43:26.500
So we have a redeem on our channel.

43:26.500 --> 43:30.180
If you want to turn in some points, you can get a post show shout out.

43:30.180 --> 43:32.900
And Dark Tetsuya actually redeemed one of those.

43:32.980 --> 43:38.420
But I am going to upgrade this for free on the house to a during the show shout out.

43:38.420 --> 43:43.300
Usually that means it hits the podcast feed because this is an important one to state.

43:43.300 --> 43:47.540
And that is, if at all possible, can I donate this one to my wife?

43:47.540 --> 43:48.580
Meeshkins.

43:48.580 --> 43:49.700
Today's her birthday.

43:50.260 --> 43:51.460
Absolutely, you can.

43:52.260 --> 43:54.500
And I want to wish a very happy birthday to Meesh.

43:54.500 --> 44:00.340
Meeshkins, but we all call Meesh for short, who has been such a support, not just here

44:00.340 --> 44:03.380
at the VoG network, but I know I see her on my streams.

44:03.380 --> 44:08.580
I'm sure she pops in to all the other faces around the voice geeks network and on Twitter

44:08.580 --> 44:09.860
and all of that stuff.

44:09.860 --> 44:11.380
Such a support of the network.

44:11.380 --> 44:15.780
So this one's upgraded on the house because I want to personally wish you a happy birthday

44:15.780 --> 44:23.140
and hope you have had a wonderful one and may the next year bring lots of awesome games.

44:23.140 --> 44:25.140
Spoiler alert, it's going to.

44:25.140 --> 44:27.940
So we love you, Meeshi.

44:27.940 --> 44:32.820
All right, well, now let's get into some gaming news.

44:33.380 --> 44:34.580
What's going on in the industry?

44:35.220 --> 44:38.820
Here's a big one to start us off about the place we call home on Sunday nights.

44:38.820 --> 44:39.380
Right, Loki?

44:39.940 --> 44:48.180
Yes, apparently the CEO of Twitch, Emmet Sheer, is no longer at the company after 16 years

44:48.180 --> 44:48.820
working there.

44:49.940 --> 44:54.980
Basically, he has resigned, I think having to do with raising his children.

44:55.860 --> 45:01.700
Basically, he had posted a blog post saying with my first child just born, I've been reflecting

45:01.700 --> 45:02.900
on my future at Twitch.

45:02.900 --> 45:06.980
Twitch often feels like a child to me that I've been raising well.

45:06.980 --> 45:12.340
And while I will always want to be there if Twitch needs me, at 16 years old, it feels

45:12.340 --> 45:15.140
to me that Twitch is ready to move out of the house and venture alone.

45:15.940 --> 45:18.260
So cool.

45:18.260 --> 45:19.220
Focus on family.

45:19.540 --> 45:26.180
I don't know who else they have coming in, though, to take his page.

45:26.180 --> 45:26.900
It's out there.

45:26.900 --> 45:28.900
It's somebody with the company today.

45:30.180 --> 45:30.740
Keep digging.

45:30.740 --> 45:32.180
It's in there somewhere.

45:32.180 --> 45:33.300
It's currently.

45:34.500 --> 45:35.300
Someone.

45:35.300 --> 45:35.800
Yes.

45:36.500 --> 45:38.500
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says he's still at the company.

45:38.500 --> 45:40.660
He's an advisor now, but that, you know.

45:40.660 --> 45:41.540
Yeah, that's fine.

45:41.540 --> 45:44.260
Sometimes that can be more of a ceremonial title, but you know.

45:44.260 --> 45:44.500
Yeah.

45:44.500 --> 45:47.460
Basically, he said, you know, it's family.

45:47.700 --> 45:52.020
With Greville, my son, the time has come for me to focus my energies on building that tiny

45:52.020 --> 45:55.140
little startup family, and I'm ready to dedicate my energies there.

45:55.140 --> 45:55.700
Cool.

45:55.700 --> 45:56.580
I think you should.

45:56.580 --> 45:56.980
Yeah.

45:56.980 --> 45:59.540
I mean, you can't fault him for the reasons.

45:59.540 --> 46:00.820
The timing is certainly.

46:00.820 --> 46:03.780
I mean, there's always going to be people that read a lot into the timing, right?

46:03.780 --> 46:07.220
Because of all the things that Twitch has gone through in the past year.

46:07.220 --> 46:10.980
I think more so the fact that the YouTube CEO just stepped down a couple of weeks ago.

46:10.980 --> 46:13.380
That's the one where I'm like, well, that's interesting.

46:13.380 --> 46:14.260
But I mean.

46:14.260 --> 46:16.260
He doesn't want to do it, too.

46:16.260 --> 46:22.340
It doesn't like any time that he stepped down, there's going to be people trying to read

46:22.340 --> 46:24.580
the tea leaves going, well, what really happened?

46:24.580 --> 46:26.100
Was he forced out?

46:26.100 --> 46:26.420
You know?

46:26.420 --> 46:33.700
Well, I mean, it's probably like, you know, the drama that was last year and stuff probably

46:35.140 --> 46:36.820
doesn't hurt as well.

46:36.820 --> 46:40.980
Like, I mean, yeah, it's like, yeah, I'm leaving for a family, but all this other drama, if

46:40.980 --> 46:42.660
I could be away from that as well.

46:42.660 --> 46:43.060
Cool.

46:43.620 --> 46:43.780
Yeah.

46:43.780 --> 46:46.420
It's like a win win there, I guess.

46:47.220 --> 46:52.020
Bobby Blackwolf in chat points out Dan Clancy was the president of Twitch and is now the

46:52.020 --> 46:52.580
CEO.

46:52.580 --> 46:53.780
He took over immediately.

46:53.780 --> 46:57.540
So not a huge changing of the guard to go from president to CEO.

46:57.540 --> 47:00.020
I would not call like a major culture shift.

47:00.020 --> 47:01.940
This isn't like what happened to Twitter.

47:02.660 --> 47:03.860
I'll just leave it at that.

47:03.860 --> 47:09.220
This is just, you know, obviously somebody who is already in a very high role just going

47:09.220 --> 47:10.500
to a different role.

47:10.580 --> 47:15.060
So I wouldn't expect a lot changes as to, you know, what's coming up in the future and

47:15.060 --> 47:15.620
all of that stuff.

47:15.620 --> 47:18.180
It's just kind of one of those things where it's like, oh, this is interesting because,

47:18.180 --> 47:23.540
you know, Emmett dates back to the Justin TV days and where Twitch was born and all

47:23.540 --> 47:25.620
of this and now is leaving.

47:25.620 --> 47:29.860
But it's hard to stay at a company for even 15 years.

47:29.860 --> 47:34.740
I think when you start to get to that point, hell, I was at a job for 14 years and that's

47:34.740 --> 47:39.940
when I finally started to realize that nothing else was ever going to happen if I didn't

47:39.940 --> 47:40.740
change companies.

47:41.460 --> 47:42.260
And I did.

47:42.260 --> 47:43.780
And that's great.

47:43.780 --> 47:47.300
You know, and not to say because some people do end up with a company they love and they

47:47.300 --> 47:48.980
do stay longer than 14 years.

47:48.980 --> 47:49.860
That's great.

47:49.860 --> 47:55.140
I'm talking about most people, you know, when they invest years and years in a company,

47:55.140 --> 47:57.060
this is the point where they start to kind of look around.

47:57.060 --> 48:00.180
What else do I want to say that I did, you know, professionally?

48:00.180 --> 48:02.100
And there's probably some of that going on as well.

48:02.100 --> 48:02.660
And that's okay.

48:02.660 --> 48:07.780
There's not much more you can do once you're CEO of the company.

48:07.780 --> 48:08.340
That's right.

48:08.340 --> 48:08.820
That's true.

48:09.540 --> 48:14.260
Questbuster says it could also be he just wants to leave the circus behind for a new

48:14.260 --> 48:14.980
chapter.

48:14.980 --> 48:19.140
Twitch is constantly under pressure from Amazon to turn a profit, from what I understand,

48:19.140 --> 48:22.820
plus dealing with all the dirty laundry aired over the years about the culture.

48:22.820 --> 48:26.420
SSG100Matt says I've had several co-workers leave right after having a kid.

48:26.420 --> 48:28.260
I've heard other folks doing so as well.

48:28.260 --> 48:31.140
Having a kid seems to be a transition spot for a lot of folks.

48:31.140 --> 48:31.380
Sure.

48:32.180 --> 48:36.180
Tigerclaw says I remember when Justin TV was doing the real life stuff, then switching

48:36.180 --> 48:39.700
to the gaming stuff only to go back to the real life stuff when they wanted more people

48:39.700 --> 48:40.180
to join.

48:40.180 --> 48:43.940
Yeah, it's been an interesting journey, this whole thing.

48:43.940 --> 48:46.820
But, you know, here we are all these years later.

48:47.940 --> 48:52.260
But I would say just going back to what Questbuster says, I think the interesting thing that could

48:52.260 --> 48:58.980
happen is you might see some other changes to try to monetize this platform a little

48:58.980 --> 48:59.300
more.

49:00.180 --> 49:04.660
And I don't know if that's going to be, people are going to be forced onto an, that's my

49:04.660 --> 49:04.980
worry.

49:05.060 --> 49:06.660
That's always in the back of my head.

49:06.660 --> 49:13.380
So when we tape live here at the Voice of the Geeks Network, I always play ads for a

49:13.380 --> 49:16.980
couple of minutes because that's how we get the pre-roll ads turned off.

49:16.980 --> 49:20.660
So before we actually start, I play pre-roll ads for a couple of minutes.

49:20.660 --> 49:25.460
So that way for about 40 minutes, no ads actually play, they're off now.

49:25.460 --> 49:29.060
So if people come into the channel, they see ads before they see us.

49:29.940 --> 49:34.180
Rob, it's been changed a little bit because when I run, I always start with a three-minute

49:34.180 --> 49:39.620
ad for my five-minute intro on my stream and it takes out 62 minutes.

49:39.620 --> 49:40.020
Yes.

49:40.020 --> 49:42.500
So they did change it recently.

49:42.500 --> 49:46.420
So you used to only be able to do a minute and a half of ads up to 30 minutes.

49:46.980 --> 49:49.700
Now you can do three minutes of ads up to 60 minutes.

49:49.700 --> 49:51.620
And I do the same on my personal stream.

49:51.620 --> 49:55.700
However, here at VOG, because we're still transitioning between Bobby's show and our

49:55.700 --> 49:59.860
show and we don't want people to be stuck in ads too long, I capped it at two minutes.

49:59.860 --> 50:03.300
Two minutes is a normal TV break and that's 40 minutes of pre-roll ads.

50:03.300 --> 50:04.900
So that's enough.

50:05.540 --> 50:09.460
And then that way we're not stalling too long between Bobby's show and kind of keeping the

50:09.460 --> 50:10.180
things moving here.

50:10.180 --> 50:14.660
But yeah, but that whole thing is still optional for broadcasters.

50:14.660 --> 50:19.540
My fear is three minutes of ads an hour is going to become mandatory.

50:19.540 --> 50:24.340
That is my concern because Twitch has no problem if you opt into it, cutting off your fee.

50:24.340 --> 50:26.420
And they're trying to sweeten the deal.

50:26.420 --> 50:29.780
They're trying to get people to opt into it by offering more incentives.

50:29.780 --> 50:30.340
And I get it.

50:30.340 --> 50:31.540
There's a lot of people that are doing it.

50:32.180 --> 50:33.220
You got to do what you got to do.

50:34.660 --> 50:37.460
But I feel like Twitch is going to make that mandatory.

50:37.460 --> 50:38.820
I can't help but dread that.

50:39.380 --> 50:40.100
I wish as a-

50:40.100 --> 50:42.580
It technically kind of is.

50:42.580 --> 50:48.100
I mean, the ads themselves, they're going to happen whether you want them to or not.

50:48.100 --> 50:48.900
That's true.

50:48.900 --> 50:51.620
You can just jump in and take control.

50:52.820 --> 50:54.100
Yes, that's true.

50:54.100 --> 50:55.380
When you want to.

50:55.380 --> 50:59.380
And I even, I mean, I have a disclaimer in mind that, hey, if you don't like it, sub

50:59.940 --> 51:00.980
or Twitch Turbo.

51:00.980 --> 51:02.020
But still, you know.

51:03.140 --> 51:07.460
Tigerclaw in chat says, how long before they set up a subscription where you have to pay

51:07.460 --> 51:08.900
to broadcast on Twitch?

51:08.900 --> 51:10.580
I'm going to put this out in the ether.

51:10.580 --> 51:10.980
And I-

51:12.820 --> 51:14.980
Bobby's going to kill me when he sees me at Dragon Combat.

51:14.980 --> 51:16.980
I'm willing to put this out there.

51:17.940 --> 51:24.900
If they wanted to charge VOG Network to broadcast on Twitch ad-free a reasonable amount of money,

51:24.900 --> 51:29.060
let's say $19.99 a month, and we could broadcast ad-free, we'd do it.

51:29.060 --> 51:33.300
We have enough support from you guys that come in with the subs and the bits and all

51:33.300 --> 51:33.700
that stuff.

51:33.700 --> 51:34.820
Again, a reasonable price.

51:34.820 --> 51:36.740
It was like $99.99 a month.

51:36.740 --> 51:37.240
No way.

51:37.700 --> 51:38.180
No.

51:38.180 --> 51:42.980
But like if it was $19.99 a month or something, I'd pay it to turn off the ads completely

51:42.980 --> 51:43.860
on this channel.

51:43.860 --> 51:45.220
I'd be willing to do it.

51:45.220 --> 51:45.620
So-

51:45.620 --> 51:52.340
And if it was, Rob, if it was $99.99 a year, that would be actually even better.

51:52.340 --> 51:53.140
Sure, sure.

51:53.140 --> 51:54.340
I'd be willing to do it.

51:54.340 --> 51:54.820
Okay.

51:54.820 --> 51:57.300
Bobby says, why would I kill you for something I agree with?

51:57.620 --> 52:00.420
For making a definitive statement without consulting with you first.

52:00.420 --> 52:02.260
But thankfully you agree with me on this one.

52:06.980 --> 52:11.940
But usually I know better than to make definitive statements about the future of VOG Network.

52:11.940 --> 52:14.020
By the way, did you know we're going to be getting a new-

52:14.020 --> 52:14.660
No, forget it.

52:14.660 --> 52:15.160
I'm not-

52:18.340 --> 52:18.740
All right.

52:18.740 --> 52:20.740
Y'all are special.

52:22.340 --> 52:24.500
But anyway, I would see that as-

52:25.460 --> 52:27.300
Again, I hope Twitch considers that.

52:27.300 --> 52:32.340
If they're going to make the ads mandatory, honestly, let me pay a nominal fee to just

52:32.340 --> 52:33.620
dodge all of that shit.

52:33.620 --> 52:35.060
I would be willing to pay it.

52:35.780 --> 52:37.300
So because I think-

52:37.300 --> 52:38.100
I think I would too.

52:38.100 --> 52:39.540
Yeah, the support of the-

52:39.540 --> 52:42.660
I don't have a gigantic audience on my personal channel and that's okay.

52:42.660 --> 52:43.780
I don't want one.

52:43.780 --> 52:46.580
I have enough support where it would work itself out.

52:46.580 --> 52:49.220
I'd essentially be able to broadcast for free, you know?

52:49.220 --> 52:50.260
And I'm okay with that.

52:50.260 --> 52:51.220
That's all I want.

52:51.220 --> 52:52.820
I want a gigantic audience.

52:53.140 --> 52:58.660
Tigerclaw says, now what if you pay the subscription to broadcast on Twitch and part of that subscription

52:58.660 --> 53:01.300
allows you to play music without getting copyright stricken?

53:02.100 --> 53:06.260
That would be a very smart thing for Twitch to do.

53:06.260 --> 53:11.460
They should make those deals and allow people to pay money to license the music and do that.

53:11.460 --> 53:12.820
That would be fantastic.

53:12.820 --> 53:17.060
I think a lot of people would be very excited about that, especially how this is growing

53:17.060 --> 53:21.060
as music in real life and your DJ sets and all that.

53:21.940 --> 53:26.100
As it's growing as a platform like that, I think that's actually a great idea.

53:27.700 --> 53:31.780
Those agreements are going to be hard to get because the record companies are greedy as fu-

53:31.780 --> 53:32.980
And never going to do it.

53:32.980 --> 53:35.140
And they're never going to do it, but it's nice.

53:35.140 --> 53:37.060
It's not Twitch's fault in that department.

53:37.060 --> 53:41.380
What a bunch of us have to do now is we can still play our music during the live stream

53:41.380 --> 53:43.140
and they don't seem to care.

53:43.140 --> 53:45.140
Yeah, you have to set it OBS a certain way.

53:45.140 --> 53:49.700
Yeah, you just can't have it as a part of your VOD, which kind of gets me in trouble

53:49.700 --> 53:51.700
because I sing along with my music.

53:51.700 --> 53:52.020
Yeah.

53:52.020 --> 53:58.020
And one day I accidentally on my personal stream, I did something where I was using

53:58.020 --> 54:02.660
a new scene and I hadn't made the Spotify and the rest of my audio separate on that

54:02.660 --> 54:03.140
scene.

54:03.140 --> 54:06.340
So I actually played it and I got muted like that.

54:07.700 --> 54:09.940
But it's not like it's my entire stream.

54:09.940 --> 54:12.100
It's just my opening segment, but it is what it is.

54:13.540 --> 54:19.300
I would like to say for streamers who are on max like me, if you want to know how to

54:19.380 --> 54:22.420
do it on a Mac because it's a little bit more involved, let me know.

54:22.420 --> 54:23.380
I'll help you out.

54:23.380 --> 54:27.300
It's actually not that hard either because we used very similar technology when we were

54:27.300 --> 54:29.620
all in the same place using the Mac Mini to broadcast.

54:30.180 --> 54:33.940
That's how we would strip the localized audio out of the feed.

54:33.940 --> 54:36.500
We had to separate it to get it to work, but it worked.

54:36.500 --> 54:38.500
Yeah, I used loopback and EQMac.

54:39.140 --> 54:42.500
Yeah, I think loopback is essential.

54:42.500 --> 54:43.000
Yeah.

54:43.940 --> 54:45.700
Alrighty, let's move on.

54:45.700 --> 54:48.900
Let's talk about another video game that has left.

54:48.900 --> 54:54.500
It's exclusive window for the Sony PlayStation, and it's now going to be on its way to Xbox,

54:54.500 --> 54:56.500
and that is Ghostwire Tokyo.

54:57.140 --> 54:59.860
Ghostwire Tokyo launched on PC and PlayStation 5.

54:59.860 --> 55:04.820
This was interesting because it was a Bethesda title, but Microsoft bought Bethesda, but

55:04.820 --> 55:07.780
this is one of the ones that still had an exclusive window.

55:07.780 --> 55:13.780
So now that window is up, you bet it's coming to Xbox Series X and S on April 12th.

55:13.780 --> 55:17.620
There will also be new content because, of course, they want to sweeten the pot here.

55:17.620 --> 55:20.420
Now that Bethesda is a Microsoft subsidiary.

55:21.300 --> 55:26.420
Tango Game Works made this game notable because they made The Evil Within and have had a lot

55:26.420 --> 55:28.420
of success this year with Hi-Fi Rush.

55:28.420 --> 55:34.340
So Ghostwire Tokyo was also one of their games, and this is where you're going around Tokyo

55:34.340 --> 55:36.180
and it's a supernatural sort of thing.

55:36.900 --> 55:38.020
We wanted to play this.

55:38.020 --> 55:38.660
Yeah.

55:38.660 --> 55:42.740
The reviews were a little mixed at launch because they were saying that the combat was a little

55:42.740 --> 55:46.340
same-sy and there was some mechanical building blocks that were recycled, but some people

55:46.340 --> 55:47.300
were really into it.

55:47.300 --> 55:52.180
And some people think that Japan's folklore that plays into the story is done very well.

55:52.180 --> 55:54.180
So there's, you know, there's kind of mixed.

55:54.180 --> 55:56.500
Mixed means some really liked it and some didn't.

55:58.180 --> 56:03.700
Yeah, Eurogamer in one of their reviews said, I can say that dull combat aside, exploring

56:03.700 --> 56:05.460
Shibuya never bores.

56:05.460 --> 56:06.900
So there's that.

56:06.900 --> 56:11.940
Anyway, Game Pass will have the games as well on the 12th of April, and there will be new

56:11.940 --> 56:12.500
content.

56:12.500 --> 56:14.500
It's called the Spider's Thread update.

56:14.500 --> 56:16.660
That's extended scenes for the main story.

56:16.660 --> 56:19.780
New locations to explore, including a school area.

56:19.780 --> 56:21.140
Oh, we love a spooky school.

56:21.860 --> 56:26.900
And new enemies like the Silent Gays, the Sanguine Dancer, and Retribution.

56:27.460 --> 56:28.740
There's also new skills.

56:28.740 --> 56:34.580
I thought you said Silent Gays, and I'm like, no one I've ever met has been silent.

56:34.580 --> 56:37.140
G-A-Z-E, Dar Sakura.

56:37.140 --> 56:41.140
I know, I thought of it afterwards, but that's the image that popped into my head.

56:42.900 --> 56:46.980
I was like, and then my brain went, it's the gay version of Silent Hill.

56:48.980 --> 56:51.380
There's new skills coming as well.

56:51.380 --> 56:52.020
No, I love it.

56:52.900 --> 56:56.180
Anyway, coming out for the Xbox on April 12th.

56:56.180 --> 57:01.060
Not surprised at all to see that, you know, now that this Bethesda, you know, signed before

57:01.060 --> 57:05.220
they were bought by Microsoft, it's getting a little enhanced and, you know, there'll

57:05.220 --> 57:07.140
probably be more people to check it out this time around.

57:07.140 --> 57:08.740
It's going to be very interesting.

57:08.740 --> 57:13.380
So we'll see, maybe the game will get a second peak or something like that.

57:13.380 --> 57:14.500
So, all right.

57:15.220 --> 57:18.180
Let's move on and talk about this next story.

57:18.180 --> 57:20.500
This is always an interesting time of year, right, Dar Sakura?

57:22.020 --> 57:30.740
Yeah, we are coming up on the Video Game Hall of Fame voting and ballots and things.

57:30.740 --> 57:32.180
Who's going to get in there?

57:33.460 --> 57:36.900
We have the 12 finalists right now.

57:37.860 --> 57:44.900
There's Age of Empires, Angry Birds, Barbie Fashion Designer, Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare,

57:44.900 --> 57:50.420
Computer Space, FIFA International Soccer, GoldenEye 007, the one that makes me motion

57:50.420 --> 57:56.020
sick, The Last of Us, NBA 2K, Quake, Wii Sports, and Wizardry.

57:57.140 --> 58:01.860
Now, it's pretty hard to narrow down.

58:01.860 --> 58:02.900
I mean, there's a few on these.

58:02.900 --> 58:04.580
I'm like, no, they don't know.

58:04.580 --> 58:07.060
Yeah, there's some I could definitely take off.

58:07.060 --> 58:12.180
But there's some on the list that I would think are kind of middling.

58:12.820 --> 58:16.340
And then there's some I think definitely have a place there.

58:16.340 --> 58:19.780
You know, I could make a list.

58:21.220 --> 58:27.540
But as far as, you know, the thing about the games is that these are games that are supposed

58:27.540 --> 58:32.900
to have had a big influence on the popular culture of the video game industry.

58:33.300 --> 58:38.820
Notable for different things like, I mean, there's a very big reason Barbie Fashion Designer

58:38.820 --> 58:39.300
is on there.

58:39.300 --> 58:41.140
You may go, oh, it's a Barbie game.

58:41.140 --> 58:51.300
But it was one of the first games marketed to female gamers, you know, to break that

58:51.300 --> 58:55.620
sort of hold that the industry had of only marketing to male gamers.

58:57.300 --> 59:01.620
You know, Wii Sports, we know why that's on there because it brought in an older crowd.

59:01.860 --> 59:10.420
You know, Computer Space was one of the first arcade releases, 1971.

59:10.420 --> 59:16.900
I might have almost done this game before, but it was basically taking these types of

59:16.900 --> 59:20.660
games out of, you know, people's computer labs, pretty much.

59:22.340 --> 59:25.940
You know, we've got all sorts of notoriety.

59:25.940 --> 59:30.740
And of course, there's always the fan voting that's online through March 22nd.

59:30.820 --> 59:32.660
So we only have a couple more days.

59:32.660 --> 59:34.820
And that's the player's choice ballot.

59:34.820 --> 59:40.180
The ones with the most public votes from one ballot will be counted alongside the ballot

59:40.180 --> 59:43.540
submitted by members of the committee of experts.

59:43.540 --> 59:47.940
And then they will be conducted in a virtual ceremony on May 4th.

59:48.740 --> 59:53.700
Well, Dark Sakura, since you mentioned you could make a list, let's put that to the test

59:53.700 --> 59:55.460
here live on air.

59:55.460 --> 59:58.340
And so what we've done, we've actually taken those 12.

59:58.420 --> 01:00:04.660
My very high technological WordPad document live on air, we've actually taken the 12 games

01:00:04.660 --> 01:00:09.460
and I'd like us now, kind of as hosts here, we're going to each go around and pick the

01:00:09.460 --> 01:00:12.820
five that we would vote for and why.

01:00:12.820 --> 01:00:16.020
So in other words, which of these queens should go home tonight and why?

01:00:16.020 --> 01:00:20.580
No, which five games would you move into?

01:00:20.580 --> 01:00:24.180
So it's kind of an interesting version of listless where we're changing the rules a

01:00:24.180 --> 01:00:27.780
little bit, but we're doing it the way they're going to vote.

01:00:27.780 --> 01:00:31.220
So which five would you keep and why?

01:00:31.220 --> 01:00:33.300
So I'll start with Dark Sakura.

01:00:34.260 --> 01:00:34.760
Okay.

01:00:35.460 --> 01:00:42.980
So, and I will admit I had honorable mentions like Goldeneye was an honorable mention, but

01:00:42.980 --> 01:00:50.100
I actually started with Barbie Fashion Designer because of the marketing behind it.

01:00:50.660 --> 01:00:52.260
It really did break a mold.

01:00:52.260 --> 01:00:56.980
It was fully marketed toward a completely different demographic than what had normally

01:00:56.980 --> 01:00:59.460
been advertised to and it belongs on there.

01:01:00.980 --> 01:01:01.620
Last of Us.

01:01:02.420 --> 01:01:09.620
Number one, that game has had a pretty massive cultural impact and in the years that it's

01:01:09.620 --> 01:01:14.900
been out, we've got a TV show based on it that I understand is really good.

01:01:14.900 --> 01:01:18.020
I need to marathon it when I can ugly cry by myself.

01:01:18.020 --> 01:01:21.060
And yes, both of those games made me super ugly cry.

01:01:21.620 --> 01:01:26.260
They, it tackled some very important, you know, social issues in it.

01:01:26.820 --> 01:01:31.700
And honestly enough, it's a game that has that lasting power.

01:01:31.700 --> 01:01:32.980
It's an instant classic.

01:01:34.660 --> 01:01:42.180
I'm going to then go to Quake because not just because of what Quake is as an FPS, because

01:01:42.180 --> 01:01:49.620
we had others before that, you know, we had Doom, we had Hexen, but Quake was really the

01:01:49.620 --> 01:01:54.980
one that I think brought it out of a more niche area.

01:01:54.980 --> 01:02:03.220
And on top of that, the modding, all the mods and we've got, you know, so many references

01:02:03.220 --> 01:02:08.660
in pop culture to Quake, not to mention we have MC Hawkings with Quake Master, just saying.

01:02:10.020 --> 01:02:13.220
So I think that Quake definitely belongs on the list.

01:02:14.820 --> 01:02:17.940
Wizardry, I put it on there because it's a classic.

01:02:18.740 --> 01:02:25.380
It spawned so many sequels and it's been sort of like a granddaddy of that genre.

01:02:27.060 --> 01:02:30.900
And then last I added computer space for the reasons before.

01:02:30.900 --> 01:02:34.260
It was an early public arcade title.

01:02:34.260 --> 01:02:37.860
It had that yellow twisty looking cabinet with the...

01:02:38.420 --> 01:02:45.860
It looked very 70's chic, you know, I think it was great, but it brought those games out

01:02:45.860 --> 01:02:53.060
of, you know, basically the nerd caves, you know, those old IBM's and brought it out into

01:02:53.060 --> 01:02:58.180
the public eye, you know, sitting there amongst the pinball tables and, you know, pre-Space

01:02:58.180 --> 01:03:00.500
Invaders, you know, if I recall correctly.

01:03:01.140 --> 01:03:10.020
So that one, I think, if not for computer space, we might not have had stuff like Space

01:03:10.100 --> 01:03:16.340
Invaders and Galaga Galaxian, you know, all of those sorts of games.

01:03:16.340 --> 01:03:20.420
I think that these are all notable for those reasons.

01:03:20.420 --> 01:03:21.220
All right.

01:03:21.220 --> 01:03:25.140
So we've put some gold stars up by the ones that Dark Sakura has named.

01:03:25.140 --> 01:03:26.580
So Loki, let's go over to you.

01:03:26.580 --> 01:03:30.740
What would be the five from this list that you would induct into the Hall of Fame?

01:03:31.860 --> 01:03:32.260
Let's see.

01:03:32.260 --> 01:03:39.140
I would probably do Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare since it basically set the gold standard

01:03:39.220 --> 01:03:42.340
for modern FPS shooter games.

01:03:42.340 --> 01:03:47.460
I mean, it was really pivotal, considering that the first three Call of Duty games are

01:03:47.460 --> 01:03:51.460
all World War II games, then they pivoted to it and who would have thought that it would

01:03:51.460 --> 01:03:53.220
have been extremely popular?

01:03:53.220 --> 01:03:55.380
So for sure, Call of Duty.

01:03:56.180 --> 01:04:01.220
Then I'd probably do Mirror Quake because, you know, it's one of the first polygonal

01:04:02.100 --> 01:04:03.220
FPS games.

01:04:03.220 --> 01:04:09.380
It's just a really awesome game that basically, you know, helped propel the genre forward.

01:04:10.100 --> 01:04:10.660
Wii Sports.

01:04:12.900 --> 01:04:15.140
Yeah, I mean, they have that as well, I guess.

01:04:15.700 --> 01:04:18.100
I don't know if I'd Hall of Fame that part.

01:04:19.620 --> 01:04:21.380
You were starting to say Wii Sports, Loki?

01:04:21.380 --> 01:04:26.660
Yeah, Wii Sports because it made games more accessible and brought in a whole bunch of

01:04:26.660 --> 01:04:28.500
people that wouldn't normally play games.

01:04:30.260 --> 01:04:30.900
Let's see.

01:04:30.980 --> 01:04:40.580
I would say probably Goldeneye because I know that was a very popular multiplayer game.

01:04:40.580 --> 01:04:45.220
Definitely pushed split screen multiplayer quite a bit.

01:04:46.020 --> 01:04:49.860
I think it really also pushed the capabilities of the N64.

01:04:49.860 --> 01:04:52.180
That's why I almost put it on my list.

01:04:52.180 --> 01:04:52.980
Yeah, for sure.

01:04:53.300 --> 01:05:01.140
I guess I'm not familiar with Wizardry.

01:05:03.460 --> 01:05:08.900
I guess Computer Space because it's one of the, you know, the earlier arcade games.

01:05:08.900 --> 01:05:11.300
So that's definitely pivotal as well.

01:05:12.340 --> 01:05:14.020
Anyway, I got one more left.

01:05:14.020 --> 01:05:15.060
Nope, that was it.

01:05:15.060 --> 01:05:15.300
Nope.

01:05:15.300 --> 01:05:17.380
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

01:05:17.380 --> 01:05:18.820
Yep, there's ten stars up on the board.

01:05:18.820 --> 01:05:21.060
So now we're going to me.

01:05:21.060 --> 01:05:21.700
All right.

01:05:21.700 --> 01:05:23.460
So here's what I would do.

01:05:24.020 --> 01:05:28.820
I would say number one, by far the biggest one on this list for me, you know, everybody

01:05:28.820 --> 01:05:29.300
has opinions.

01:05:29.300 --> 01:05:30.020
That's fine for me.

01:05:30.020 --> 01:05:33.140
The biggest one on this list that deserves to be in the Hall of Fame is Wii Sports.

01:05:33.700 --> 01:05:39.940
I think when history looks back on what gaming was in the aughts, I think, you know, Wii

01:05:39.940 --> 01:05:46.500
and everything that this game did for pushing an entire platform forward and really selling

01:05:46.500 --> 01:05:49.940
Nintendo's, you know, silly named console and all that forward.

01:05:49.940 --> 01:05:53.300
I think Wii Sports is going to be seen as pivotal for that.

01:05:54.180 --> 01:05:56.900
Number two on my list, I would say Quake, actually.

01:05:56.900 --> 01:05:59.140
So that's one that all three of us are going to end up saying.

01:05:59.700 --> 01:06:02.340
I think you have several shooters that are represented on this list.

01:06:02.340 --> 01:06:06.420
I think Quake is the one, again, it really defined an era of PC gaming.

01:06:06.420 --> 01:06:10.660
And I think, you know, as was already brought up, the mods, especially when you consider

01:06:10.660 --> 01:06:17.780
things like Team Fortress that then turned into their own things, I think is huge.

01:06:17.780 --> 01:06:19.380
So I think Quake, absolutely.

01:06:19.940 --> 01:06:24.500
It looks like that's the only one all three of us are probably going to say is one of

01:06:24.500 --> 01:06:25.780
the huge ones in the list.

01:06:27.060 --> 01:06:27.780
Other titles.

01:06:28.660 --> 01:06:34.900
I would say The Last of Us might be a little bit early.

01:06:34.900 --> 01:06:39.220
And I understand maybe some of the concerns with that, with The Last of Us.

01:06:39.220 --> 01:06:46.180
But I do think that, especially with the success of the TV show, and I think when people kind

01:06:46.180 --> 01:06:50.980
of look back on gaming and TV and all that medium and stuff, I think The Last of Us is

01:06:50.980 --> 01:06:52.580
going to hold up very strong.

01:06:52.580 --> 01:06:57.060
So I think as far as like a strong contemporary choice, The Last of Us would definitely be

01:06:57.060 --> 01:06:57.620
on my list.

01:06:58.820 --> 01:07:00.340
So that was one, two, three.

01:07:00.340 --> 01:07:05.060
So number four for me, I'm actually going to say Wizardry.

01:07:05.060 --> 01:07:13.380
I think, again, there's really an era of early PC gaming that Wizardry really influenced.

01:07:13.380 --> 01:07:19.060
And I think as far as we look at role playing games as they were developed by Japanese companies

01:07:19.060 --> 01:07:23.460
and role playing games as they were developed by American companies, Wizardry was really

01:07:24.100 --> 01:07:31.540
the roots of where the American developed ones kind of ended up going as a result.

01:07:32.260 --> 01:07:36.740
And then the last one I would put on my list, and this may surprise you, I'm actually not

01:07:36.740 --> 01:07:38.100
going to go with what you think.

01:07:38.100 --> 01:07:40.740
And I'm going to put Barbie Fashion Designer as my number five.

01:07:41.700 --> 01:07:46.100
I think kind of as Dark Sakura already kind of hit on the main points of that, as much

01:07:46.100 --> 01:07:51.460
as you might look at that and go, LOL Barbie, I think it's important to note that, again,

01:07:51.460 --> 01:07:59.220
this was the game industry acknowledging that there were more people that games needed to

01:07:59.220 --> 01:08:05.620
be accessible to and open to and targeted to, to bring into the gaming world.

01:08:05.780 --> 01:08:11.300
And I think really just set, again, a standard for an entire genre of

01:08:12.020 --> 01:08:16.260
Nancy Drew type games and things that followed it in the PC era.

01:08:16.260 --> 01:08:17.460
So those are my five.

01:08:17.460 --> 01:08:18.260
It's very tropey.

01:08:18.820 --> 01:08:19.780
Yeah, yeah.

01:08:19.780 --> 01:08:21.540
I mean, it's very tropey.

01:08:21.540 --> 01:08:24.340
But again, it's the Nith event.

01:08:24.980 --> 01:08:25.700
Significant.

01:08:25.700 --> 01:08:26.420
It's significant.

01:08:27.380 --> 01:08:27.780
Yeah.

01:08:27.780 --> 01:08:32.740
And in my opinion, FIFA and NBA 2K should never be in the Hall of Fame ever because

01:08:32.740 --> 01:08:38.740
of the crap that they perpetuated in this industry, the absolute vile monetization

01:08:38.740 --> 01:08:41.780
practices that are FIFA Ultimate Team.

01:08:42.900 --> 01:08:44.020
To hell with that series.

01:08:44.020 --> 01:08:48.980
I'm sorry, but they put FIFA 23 as the box art, you know, so they're representing their

01:08:48.980 --> 01:08:51.700
most recent game as Hall of Fame worthy.

01:08:51.700 --> 01:08:52.340
No way.

01:08:52.340 --> 01:08:53.860
That is never going to make it in there.

01:08:53.860 --> 01:09:00.260
And the NBA 2K is just as bad, you know, with the monetization and just the half-assed

01:09:00.260 --> 01:09:04.420
development on these games churning out the same thing year after year.

01:09:04.420 --> 01:09:04.900
No, thanks.

01:09:04.900 --> 01:09:06.660
That does not belong in the Hall of Fame.

01:09:06.660 --> 01:09:07.220
I would agree.

01:09:07.940 --> 01:09:10.020
But Dalton, in support, tell us how you really feel.

01:09:10.020 --> 01:09:13.620
And honestly, for me, the only reason I didn't say Call of Duty and GoldenEye is that you

01:09:13.620 --> 01:09:17.620
already had another shooter on there and pretty much all that's left after that is you have

01:09:17.620 --> 01:09:19.460
Angry Birds and Age of Empires.

01:09:19.460 --> 01:09:21.460
There's nothing wrong with either of those games, certainly.

01:09:21.460 --> 01:09:26.580
And again, I think Age of Empires also speaks certainly to a very distinct genre of game

01:09:27.140 --> 01:09:29.380
I think is already represented in the Hall of Fame.

01:09:29.380 --> 01:09:32.020
But I understand Age of Empires significance.

01:09:32.020 --> 01:09:35.140
It's just, you know, you have to pick five from the 12 and that's just when it falls

01:09:35.140 --> 01:09:35.700
by the wayside.

01:09:35.700 --> 01:09:37.540
It's a similar thing with Angry Birds.

01:09:37.540 --> 01:09:43.140
I understand that Angry Birds, as far as mobile titles go, is hugely significant.

01:09:43.140 --> 01:09:46.980
And with the movies and everything and the marketing and everything else, I get it.

01:09:46.980 --> 01:09:50.100
But I just don't know if I look back on that game fondly.

01:09:50.900 --> 01:09:55.860
My thing about Angry Birds, why I think it is on the list, not just for what you were

01:09:55.860 --> 01:10:03.700
saying, is because it spawned a whole, I would say, push for the casual gamer in gaming culture.

01:10:05.300 --> 01:10:06.580
You know, the mobile gamer.

01:10:06.580 --> 01:10:11.220
And on top of that, it turned into a massive merchandising empire.

01:10:11.780 --> 01:10:16.100
You know, if anything, I would say that the Angry Birds franchise is one of the biggest

01:10:16.100 --> 01:10:24.260
ones to sort of show about the influence of video games and merchandising in selling,

01:10:25.060 --> 01:10:28.660
you know, plushies and shirts and movies.

01:10:28.660 --> 01:10:32.580
And that's where I think there's notability there.

01:10:34.420 --> 01:10:38.180
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, to me, the Hall of Fame isn't about what you think of fondly.

01:10:38.180 --> 01:10:40.580
It is more about what's influential in the gaming.

01:10:40.580 --> 01:10:43.140
And Angry Birds was huge with both of my parents.

01:10:43.140 --> 01:10:46.260
It's the only game they played because it was accessible to them in their 70s.

01:10:46.980 --> 01:10:48.420
Respect that viewpoint.

01:10:48.420 --> 01:10:51.300
I stand by my choices under the criteria that you provided.

01:10:52.020 --> 01:10:55.460
So, and everybody's going to look at that differently because everybody has their own

01:10:55.460 --> 01:10:56.260
little anecdotes.

01:10:56.900 --> 01:11:00.420
Wizardry, I think, looking at chat and just looking at the general comments in there,

01:11:00.420 --> 01:11:06.260
I think a lot of people that probably played it sort of kind of, and other people have

01:11:06.260 --> 01:11:06.820
never played it.

01:11:06.820 --> 01:11:08.900
And so that maybe they don't understand why it's influential.

01:11:08.900 --> 01:11:09.380
And I get it.

01:11:09.380 --> 01:11:10.980
And I'm not faulting anyone for it.

01:11:10.980 --> 01:11:13.860
You know, it's just everybody's experiences is different a little bit, right?

01:11:13.860 --> 01:11:21.060
So anyway, let's take a look and see what we decided as show hosts should be the top

01:11:21.060 --> 01:11:21.460
five.

01:11:21.460 --> 01:11:24.420
And it looks like we actually kind of have a top six.

01:11:24.420 --> 01:11:26.900
It looks like the one we're all in agreement on is Quake.

01:11:26.900 --> 01:11:28.900
So Quake definitely makes the list.

01:11:29.540 --> 01:11:35.540
And then from there, you kind of have a five-way tie between Barbie Fashion Designer,

01:11:36.260 --> 01:11:46.980
Computer Space, Last of Us, Wii Sports, and Wizardry kind of all barely make the list

01:11:46.980 --> 01:11:47.300
there.

01:11:47.300 --> 01:11:51.540
So it would come down to those choices for us here at Orange Lounge Radio.

01:11:51.540 --> 01:11:53.140
So that was fun.

01:11:53.140 --> 01:11:58.180
I just also think it's very interesting hearing what we all think of these selections

01:11:58.180 --> 01:11:59.620
by going through a list like this.

01:12:01.060 --> 01:12:06.660
You know, it goes to show that different games mean different things to different people.

01:12:06.660 --> 01:12:07.380
Yeah, yeah.

01:12:07.380 --> 01:12:12.820
But when you can see the commonality amongst, you know, why we would choose what we chose,

01:12:13.700 --> 01:12:16.900
you know, it also speaks to how games can bring people together.

01:12:16.900 --> 01:12:18.660
Yeah, for sure, for sure.

01:12:19.780 --> 01:12:26.420
Also, I had to link that to my friend Annie of Saver and Stuff Bomb Never Told You because

01:12:26.420 --> 01:12:28.180
I know she's going to vote for Last of Us.

01:12:29.700 --> 01:12:33.620
SSJ100Matt says, Loki and Rob have a point and I agree about the monetization stuff,

01:12:33.620 --> 01:12:36.580
but I do think there is a place for licensed sports games.

01:12:36.580 --> 01:12:40.340
Sure, if it was NHL 93, I would have put it in my five.

01:12:40.340 --> 01:12:42.420
If it was NBA Jam, I would have put it in my five.

01:12:42.900 --> 01:12:47.860
If they had represented those by like a certain version of the game, you know, an earlier

01:12:47.860 --> 01:12:49.220
one prior to all this stuff.

01:12:49.220 --> 01:12:51.540
Yeah, I would be on board with that for sure.

01:12:51.540 --> 01:12:58.020
But they represented it with the most recent box art and that could be just the decision

01:12:58.020 --> 01:12:59.060
of the article or whatever.

01:12:59.060 --> 01:13:03.860
But if you're represented by the most recent version, then I'm sorry, I'm not going to

01:13:03.860 --> 01:13:05.860
agree that that should be a Hall of Fame material.

01:13:05.860 --> 01:13:06.360
Yeah.

01:13:07.220 --> 01:13:07.720
All right.

01:13:08.500 --> 01:13:11.300
But everybody, everybody can have their perspective.

01:13:11.300 --> 01:13:15.300
And so it will be interesting to see what the five end up actually being.

01:13:15.300 --> 01:13:19.620
I think even though it didn't make our list, I do think Angry Birds makes the actual top

01:13:19.620 --> 01:13:19.940
five.

01:13:19.940 --> 01:13:20.660
I really do.

01:13:20.660 --> 01:13:24.980
I just I think voters will put like, again, it's how I would have voted.

01:13:24.980 --> 01:13:30.340
I think the way voters will vote, I think it'll be Angry Birds, Wii Sports, Last of

01:13:30.340 --> 01:13:30.900
Us, Quake.

01:13:30.900 --> 01:13:32.420
I think those are all shoo-ins.

01:13:32.420 --> 01:13:34.340
The fifth one is going to be the wild card for me.

01:13:34.340 --> 01:13:40.740
I'm not sure if something like Computer Space gets in there or Wizardry or maybe surprises

01:13:40.740 --> 01:13:42.100
me and it is one of the sports titles.

01:13:42.100 --> 01:13:42.900
I don't know.

01:13:42.900 --> 01:13:43.460
So we'll see.

01:13:44.420 --> 01:13:50.260
Really don't see how Computer Space couldn't make it in given, you know, we've got, quote,

01:13:50.260 --> 01:13:51.780
experts voting on this.

01:13:52.980 --> 01:13:58.100
And, and I mean, if, if you're, you know, people who have been prominent in the industry

01:13:58.100 --> 01:14:03.060
and have followed the trends and hopefully would be sort of our same generation or maybe

01:14:03.060 --> 01:14:06.420
even older, they might understand why something like that would belong in there.

01:14:06.420 --> 01:14:14.420
So I'm, I'm really hoping that, that we have that love given to our, our quote for parent

01:14:14.420 --> 01:14:15.460
games, you know?

01:14:16.340 --> 01:14:17.380
So, all right.

01:14:18.100 --> 01:14:19.220
Well, let's move on.

01:14:19.220 --> 01:14:26.020
Let's move on to the next story, which we'll talk a little bit about maybe the future of

01:14:26.020 --> 01:14:27.220
games a little bit.

01:14:27.220 --> 01:14:31.380
Although there's a little bit of what's old is new again in this, but I'll let Loki talk

01:14:31.380 --> 01:14:33.540
about it and then kind of say what I have to say on this.

01:14:34.260 --> 01:14:34.500
Yeah.

01:14:34.500 --> 01:14:40.900
So they've got this new Fortnite Unreal Editor or Unreal Editor for Fortnite.

01:14:40.900 --> 01:14:46.500
It's a PC app that's designed for developing and publishing games and experiences directly

01:14:46.500 --> 01:14:47.860
into Fortnite.

01:14:47.860 --> 01:14:53.140
They say that with many Unreal, many of Unreal 5's powerful tools and workflows at your

01:14:53.140 --> 01:14:58.820
fingertips, including custom asset import, modeling materials, VFX, Sequencer, and controller,

01:14:58.820 --> 01:15:03.460
you'll have a whole new world of options for publishing games and experiences for Fortnite.

01:15:04.340 --> 01:15:09.540
And it sounds to me a little bit like almost like kind of a Roblox type thing.

01:15:09.540 --> 01:15:15.060
This also sounds very similar to, and I can't remember now the name of the platform that

01:15:15.060 --> 01:15:19.540
they have, but it's also Unreal Engine based where you could build your own games out of

01:15:19.540 --> 01:15:21.700
kind of assets and stuff that they had as well.

01:15:22.580 --> 01:15:27.620
I don't know if that platform ever took off well, but I can imagine tying the Fortnite

01:15:27.620 --> 01:15:29.940
brand to it could be interesting.

01:15:29.940 --> 01:15:36.740
And also what exactly comes out of this, if they're going to try to like, you know, morph

01:15:36.740 --> 01:15:40.180
Fortnite into kind of like a Roblox type of thing.

01:15:40.180 --> 01:15:42.740
I mean, could be neat, I guess.

01:15:44.420 --> 01:15:50.660
They're going to have all sorts of licensing problems like they did with like Roblox does

01:15:50.660 --> 01:15:52.420
or just lets it run rampant.

01:15:52.420 --> 01:15:56.260
But there's some interesting stuff coming out of like Roblox, at least.

01:15:56.820 --> 01:15:59.860
I know my kids have been playing this game called Frontline.

01:15:59.860 --> 01:16:04.660
That's kind of a Call of Duty Modern Warfare shooter game that's in there that doesn't

01:16:04.660 --> 01:16:06.420
look like Roblox, which is kind of cool.

01:16:07.940 --> 01:16:12.260
I'm curious to see what type of non-gaming art pieces because, you know, in Fortnite,

01:16:12.260 --> 01:16:16.980
we've seen interesting things like the concerts, the launches of other media in there.

01:16:16.980 --> 01:16:20.100
I always refer to the Ariana Grande concert, but it really like that was the thing that

01:16:20.100 --> 01:16:25.540
got me to look at Fortnite and go, oh, wow, this really is kind of something different.

01:16:25.860 --> 01:16:27.620
It's not just shooty bang bang.

01:16:27.620 --> 01:16:29.780
It's like interactive art piece.

01:16:29.780 --> 01:16:34.340
I'm excited to see that type of stuff from like indie artists that maybe tap into this

01:16:34.340 --> 01:16:35.700
and use this a little bit.

01:16:35.700 --> 01:16:37.140
I think it'd be very interesting.

01:16:37.140 --> 01:16:40.420
Yeah, I'd be curious how it actually works, though.

01:16:40.420 --> 01:16:41.620
Yeah, I would too.

01:16:41.620 --> 01:16:42.900
Yeah, I'm very curious.

01:16:42.900 --> 01:16:47.220
But also, and the reason why I set up the story kind of funky is because, of course,

01:16:47.220 --> 01:16:52.580
Epic Games, Grandpa's always going to bring up ZZT, which I've brought up a lot on this

01:16:52.580 --> 01:16:55.940
show, especially we talk about, you know, Tim Sweeney's start in the industry.

01:16:55.940 --> 01:17:01.140
I'm not a fan of a lot of his shit now, but certainly back in the day in the 90s when

01:17:01.140 --> 01:17:03.700
he was making ZZT, like that game was legendary.

01:17:03.700 --> 01:17:05.460
And you might remember ZZT.

01:17:05.460 --> 01:17:06.420
Why was it popular?

01:17:06.420 --> 01:17:11.300
Because it brought this whole ZZT OOP object oriented programming language where you could

01:17:11.300 --> 01:17:12.580
make your own games.

01:17:12.580 --> 01:17:16.020
And we saw some really cool shit in ZZT back in the day.

01:17:16.020 --> 01:17:20.820
And that's why to me, it's like, this is fascinating how this has come full circle.

01:17:20.820 --> 01:17:23.620
And essentially, ZZT is coming to Fortnite.

01:17:24.180 --> 01:17:29.540
Actually, I would love to see somebody build ZZT in Fortnite, and I think it'll happen.

01:17:30.100 --> 01:17:33.460
But you still have a programming language.

01:17:33.460 --> 01:17:36.100
It may not be ZZT OOP, but now it's unreal.

01:17:36.740 --> 01:17:38.260
Probably like C++.

01:17:38.260 --> 01:17:42.420
Yeah, that's now going to allow people to make their own stuff in Fortnite.

01:17:42.420 --> 01:17:44.180
And it could be very interesting.

01:17:44.180 --> 01:17:48.420
I've been watching a lot more Fortnite because Alan's been getting into it more.

01:17:48.420 --> 01:17:50.100
He streams it occasionally.

01:17:50.100 --> 01:17:54.100
He kind of prefers his mod games, but I watch over his shoulder sometimes.

01:17:54.100 --> 01:17:56.020
And Fortnite, it's interesting.

01:17:56.020 --> 01:17:59.060
It's still going after all this time.

01:17:59.060 --> 01:18:04.580
And especially the no build mode is great for people like me that just think the building

01:18:04.580 --> 01:18:07.060
adds something to the game that doesn't need to be there.

01:18:07.060 --> 01:18:10.980
But yeah, it's great.

01:18:10.980 --> 01:18:15.460
So I'm very curious to see what this Unreal editor brings, especially when it comes to

01:18:15.460 --> 01:18:16.900
non-gaming experiences.

01:18:16.900 --> 01:18:18.820
Yeah, it comes out in the 22nd.

01:18:18.820 --> 01:18:19.780
I think it's for free.

01:18:20.020 --> 01:18:22.580
So check it out, I guess, if you're interested.

01:18:23.220 --> 01:18:23.720
All right.

01:18:24.660 --> 01:18:28.980
Before I get to the next story, I noticed Dark Sakura's cat has entered the chat.

01:18:28.980 --> 01:18:31.300
Would Midna care to comment on any of the stories tonight?

01:18:32.100 --> 01:18:33.140
You have anything to say?

01:18:35.060 --> 01:18:35.700
Put me down.

01:18:38.260 --> 01:18:39.540
Did you hear the grunt?

01:18:39.540 --> 01:18:40.180
I did.

01:18:40.180 --> 01:18:40.740
I did.

01:18:40.740 --> 01:18:41.300
That's great.

01:18:43.460 --> 01:18:47.380
She's just mad because I picked her up and she's like, mother, no.

01:18:47.380 --> 01:18:47.880
I tried to.

01:18:48.660 --> 01:18:49.160
No.

01:18:49.480 --> 01:18:53.480
I tried to pick up Cheddar earlier and I had him on cam for like two seconds, but he was

01:18:53.480 --> 01:18:54.600
not having it.

01:18:54.600 --> 01:18:57.960
He came in here and was like, meow, meow, meow.

01:18:57.960 --> 01:19:00.040
I have plenty of pictures of Cheddar, let me tell you.

01:19:00.040 --> 01:19:03.960
But oh, are you going to redo the movie at the start of the thing?

01:19:04.600 --> 01:19:09.480
Yeah, I need to because I had that one where I had to fix a gap in it.

01:19:10.680 --> 01:19:16.120
But I would like to expand and add in some of the community cats.

01:19:16.920 --> 01:19:18.600
Make them pay points to put their cat in.

01:19:18.680 --> 01:19:19.240
No, just kidding.

01:19:20.040 --> 01:19:21.400
We could put a redeem like that.

01:19:22.600 --> 01:19:24.360
I don't want you to have to update it all the time, though.

01:19:24.360 --> 01:19:25.240
So, but yes.

01:19:27.080 --> 01:19:27.880
That would be fine.

01:19:27.880 --> 01:19:30.760
What I would do is I would take them for a month and implement them at the end of the

01:19:30.760 --> 01:19:31.260
month.

01:19:32.040 --> 01:19:32.540
Okay.

01:19:33.800 --> 01:19:34.680
We could look into do it.

01:19:34.680 --> 01:19:37.800
I was just going to say, just open it up and let the listeners submit their cats.

01:19:37.800 --> 01:19:42.200
But if we want to make them pay points to do it, I'm sure people are sitting on thousands

01:19:42.200 --> 01:19:43.640
upon thousands of points.

01:19:44.760 --> 01:19:46.760
And I'm sure are happy to burn them.

01:19:46.840 --> 01:19:49.800
So we'll see, because we don't have a lot of redeems on this channel.

01:19:49.800 --> 01:19:51.240
It's just the way it's set up.

01:19:51.240 --> 01:19:52.840
So, all right.

01:19:52.840 --> 01:19:56.440
Now, we also need like our alert commands and stuff like that.

01:19:56.440 --> 01:19:58.840
We definitely need to update some things.

01:19:58.840 --> 01:19:59.640
A first?

01:19:59.640 --> 01:20:00.280
First command?

01:20:04.680 --> 01:20:06.200
All right, moving on.

01:20:06.200 --> 01:20:13.320
Let's talk about a rumor, rumor, rumor of a Soul Calibur remaster potentially incoming.

01:20:13.320 --> 01:20:17.400
You know, we haven't seen much with the Soul Calibur series since the sixth game, which

01:20:17.400 --> 01:20:19.320
I feel like was a couple of years ago at this point.

01:20:19.320 --> 01:20:26.440
But if rumors are to be believed, including Xbox game journalist Shifal Nick, I hope I

01:20:26.440 --> 01:20:31.880
said that right, sorry, from exputer.com, I believe is the website, reporting that Bandai

01:20:31.880 --> 01:20:35.640
Namco is preparing a remaster of the original Soul Calibur.

01:20:35.640 --> 01:20:41.560
This was on the Xbox era podcast, but he's unsure if it's the original Soul Calibur or

01:20:41.560 --> 01:20:43.960
is it a collection with one and two.

01:20:44.520 --> 01:20:50.920
After all, Soul Calibur 2 was probably the most epic edition of the game, probably because

01:20:50.920 --> 01:20:52.920
the GameCube version had Link.

01:20:52.920 --> 01:20:55.240
So, I don't know if they would be able to keep any of that.

01:20:55.240 --> 01:20:59.000
You might remember, you got to go way back, but the GameCube version had Link.

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:05.160
The Xbox version had a Tekken character, right?

01:21:05.160 --> 01:21:06.040
Wasn't it?

01:21:06.040 --> 01:21:07.640
I don't remember who the PlayStation.

01:21:07.640 --> 01:21:10.600
I remember, oh, we lost Dark Sakura.

01:21:10.600 --> 01:21:15.160
I remember the Xbox version had Spawn.

01:21:15.160 --> 01:21:16.040
I remember that.

01:21:17.400 --> 01:21:19.880
I don't remember who the PlayStation had.

01:21:19.880 --> 01:21:20.600
Heihachi.

01:21:20.600 --> 01:21:21.480
Was it Heihachi?

01:21:21.480 --> 01:21:21.720
Okay.

01:21:21.720 --> 01:21:23.160
I thought it was somebody from Tekken.

01:21:23.160 --> 01:21:23.660
Yeah.

01:21:24.600 --> 01:21:25.240
So, all right.

01:21:26.440 --> 01:21:27.960
I thought we had Yoshimitsu in one.

01:21:29.240 --> 01:21:31.560
He came later, not in Soul Calibur 2.

01:21:31.560 --> 01:21:35.880
He was a character in, no, he's like in the original.

01:21:35.880 --> 01:21:37.960
He was just always a playable character in the series.

01:21:37.960 --> 01:21:39.640
I mean, I don't know why I was thinking that.

01:21:39.640 --> 01:21:44.040
I meant the Star Wars characters.

01:21:44.040 --> 01:21:44.680
They were four.

01:21:44.680 --> 01:21:45.400
That was four.

01:21:45.400 --> 01:21:47.080
They were the big land in four.

01:21:47.080 --> 01:21:47.320
Yeah.

01:21:47.880 --> 01:21:50.280
Three had the Assassin's Creed crossover.

01:21:51.080 --> 01:21:52.840
Four was Star Wars.

01:21:52.840 --> 01:21:55.880
Five, I don't remember.

01:21:55.880 --> 01:21:59.000
Battle of War, or it was Kratos, I think, was in one of them.

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:00.440
Oh, you're right.

01:22:02.440 --> 01:22:05.560
Was there even anyone on Xbox or was it just PlayStation that got

01:22:05.560 --> 01:22:06.120
Kratos?

01:22:07.240 --> 01:22:09.160
That might have been the PlayStation only one.

01:22:09.160 --> 01:22:11.160
I think they only released five on PlayStation.

01:22:13.160 --> 01:22:14.440
I could be wrong.

01:22:14.440 --> 01:22:15.320
And then six.

01:22:15.320 --> 01:22:16.040
I don't remember who...

01:22:16.040 --> 01:22:17.320
Oh, six had the Witcher guy.

01:22:17.320 --> 01:22:19.080
Geralt was in six.

01:22:19.960 --> 01:22:22.120
So, interesting.

01:22:22.120 --> 01:22:22.620
All right.

01:22:23.560 --> 01:22:27.080
Let's move on and get to our next story.

01:22:27.080 --> 01:22:27.960
So, Dark Sakura.

01:22:27.960 --> 01:22:36.600
So, and this information is coming directly from the Federal Trade Commission.

01:22:36.600 --> 01:22:44.600
So, nothing through any sort of lens other than what the FTC has said posted as of the

01:22:44.600 --> 01:22:45.720
14th of this month.

01:22:46.840 --> 01:22:53.880
So, they have finalized an order requiring Epic Games, as in, you know, our Fortnite

01:22:53.880 --> 01:23:02.520
friends, to pay $245 million to consumers to settle charges that the company made using

01:23:03.080 --> 01:23:08.680
dark patterns to trick players into making unwanted purchases and also letting underage

01:23:09.560 --> 01:23:15.000
players also rack up purchases without parental involvement.

01:23:15.880 --> 01:23:22.440
Basically, in the settlement, the FTC said that...

01:23:23.240 --> 01:23:25.000
I'll just go ahead and read this.

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:29.080
Epic deployed a variety of design tricks known as dark patterns aimed at getting consumers

01:23:29.080 --> 01:23:32.200
of all ages to make unintended in-game purchases.

01:23:33.720 --> 01:23:39.400
Fortnite's counterintuitive, inconsistent, and confusing button configuration led players

01:23:39.400 --> 01:23:43.480
to incur unwanted charges based on the press of a single button.

01:23:43.560 --> 01:23:48.360
The company also made it easy for children to make purchases while playing Fortnite without

01:23:48.360 --> 01:23:50.920
requiring any parental consent.

01:23:50.920 --> 01:23:56.200
According to the FTC's complaint, Epic also locked the accounts of customers who disputed

01:23:56.200 --> 01:23:58.520
unauthorized charges with their credit card companies.

01:23:59.640 --> 01:24:05.400
They must pay $245 million, which will be used to provide refunds to consumers.

01:24:06.040 --> 01:24:12.040
They also prohibit Epic from charging through dark patterns and otherwise

01:24:14.040 --> 01:24:15.720
charging without affirmative consent.

01:24:16.760 --> 01:24:18.760
So no more one button purchase.

01:24:18.760 --> 01:24:21.320
It's like purchase, do you agree?

01:24:21.320 --> 01:24:22.120
That kind of thing.

01:24:23.800 --> 01:24:29.400
And it also bars Epic from blocking customers from accessing their accounts for disputing

01:24:29.400 --> 01:24:30.440
unauthorized charges.

01:24:33.160 --> 01:24:36.680
The commission voted four to zero to approve the complaint and order.

01:24:37.880 --> 01:24:39.160
There's a separate settlement.

01:24:39.160 --> 01:24:41.080
Also, this was announced in December.

01:24:41.880 --> 01:24:48.120
Epic agreed to pay $275 million penalty to settle FTC allegations that the company violated

01:24:48.120 --> 01:24:50.200
the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act.

01:24:56.280 --> 01:25:01.480
Apparently, some data had been leaked involving underage players.

01:25:02.200 --> 01:25:09.160
And also lists this for those who want, who may be involved or entitled to compensation.

01:25:10.040 --> 01:25:17.560
If you believe you have been injured by Epic's practices, you can visit ftc.gov slash Fortnite.

01:25:18.520 --> 01:25:27.560
So Federal Trade Commission site ftc.gov gov slash Fortnite and see if you're eligible

01:25:27.560 --> 01:25:33.640
and see if you're eligible for any portion of this dispensation.

01:25:34.200 --> 01:25:39.960
And this will probably be mostly, not exclusively, but mostly families with kids who racked up

01:25:39.960 --> 01:25:47.960
purchases because, you know, the one touch purchasing and the tricks they do moving the

01:25:47.960 --> 01:25:51.480
buttons around and things like that, you know, just all that.

01:25:51.480 --> 01:25:56.840
So I'm kind of glad that we're creating some sort of standards for these games because

01:25:56.840 --> 01:26:02.280
there's a lot of especially there's a lot of stuff out there with like an ad will come

01:26:02.280 --> 01:26:05.640
up on the screen and you can't even like X out of the ad.

01:26:05.640 --> 01:26:07.080
And it's very annoying.

01:26:07.080 --> 01:26:08.760
And those aren't the Fortnite.

01:26:08.760 --> 01:26:11.400
Those are the more like up and coming type of games and stuff.

01:26:11.400 --> 01:26:16.920
So I'm kind of glad that this is going to set kind of a standard that at least these

01:26:16.920 --> 01:26:20.840
larger studios have to go by that some of these nasty tricks are going to get in trouble

01:26:20.840 --> 01:26:21.400
for.

01:26:21.400 --> 01:26:26.200
So I think it was kind of needed for the industry, not just for Epic.

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:34.360
Well, and this really is going to set a precedence, too, and send a very clear message that no.

01:26:34.360 --> 01:26:36.200
Yeah, we're not down with that.

01:26:36.200 --> 01:26:36.700
Yeah.

01:26:37.160 --> 01:26:40.680
So all right, let's move on.

01:26:40.680 --> 01:26:42.200
And we're over to Loki.

01:26:43.320 --> 01:26:45.640
So excited for this game to be coming out.

01:26:45.640 --> 01:26:48.040
It's one of those games of 2023.

01:26:48.040 --> 01:26:49.960
It's Square Enix's NFT game.

01:26:49.960 --> 01:26:50.600
Oh, yeah.

01:26:51.240 --> 01:26:52.440
Features here already.

01:26:53.400 --> 01:26:58.920
It's Symbiogenesis, and they have the first official trailer come out for the game.

01:27:00.680 --> 01:27:02.040
I don't know what it is.

01:27:02.040 --> 01:27:05.560
I don't know what the game is because the trailer doesn't show anything.

01:27:05.560 --> 01:27:11.080
It just has annoying music and it shows like some landscape thing.

01:27:11.080 --> 01:27:14.680
To be fair, that's very typical for Square Enix trailers.

01:27:14.680 --> 01:27:19.480
So like, I'm not going to razz Symbiogenesis for that when there's so much more we could

01:27:19.480 --> 01:27:20.440
be critical of, right?

01:27:21.240 --> 01:27:28.760
Yeah, so basically it says Square Enix has all the story chapters can be completed and

01:27:28.760 --> 01:27:31.640
played to the end even without having character NFTs.

01:27:32.440 --> 01:27:37.240
But those in-game purchases will arrive with a specific utility for those who hold the

01:27:37.240 --> 01:27:38.600
NFT collectible art.

01:27:38.600 --> 01:27:43.880
Players with character NFTs will be able to read unique stories, gain rank experience

01:27:43.880 --> 01:27:50.120
points easily, create a replica of their character and gain additional NFT art when the missions

01:27:50.120 --> 01:27:51.160
are cleared.

01:27:51.160 --> 01:27:55.560
So some story elements will be withheld from players who do not purchase NFTs impacting

01:27:55.560 --> 01:27:57.160
the overall gameplay experience.

01:27:58.680 --> 01:28:01.560
And you know how we can make sure that we avoid all that?

01:28:02.360 --> 01:28:03.160
Don't buy it.

01:28:03.160 --> 01:28:03.880
Don't support it.

01:28:03.880 --> 01:28:04.760
I mean, that's easy.

01:28:04.760 --> 01:28:07.400
I have no interest in this game whatsoever.

01:28:07.400 --> 01:28:11.800
So this is the wrong year to release this.

01:28:11.800 --> 01:28:16.360
Actually, no, this is the right year to release this game so that it completely falls off

01:28:16.360 --> 01:28:18.680
the radar and Babylon flops.

01:28:18.680 --> 01:28:20.840
Like that's what's going to happen to this game.

01:28:24.760 --> 01:28:25.240
That's it.

01:28:25.240 --> 01:28:26.200
That's all I have to say.

01:28:26.200 --> 01:28:28.200
I don't think this game deserves anything more than that.

01:28:28.200 --> 01:28:28.700
So.

01:28:29.880 --> 01:28:30.840
Exactly.

01:28:30.840 --> 01:28:31.340
So.

01:28:31.720 --> 01:28:32.440
All right.

01:28:32.440 --> 01:28:38.680
If you want to see how a Square Enix president got fired, you can check this game out.

01:28:38.680 --> 01:28:40.600
All right, moving on.

01:28:41.560 --> 01:28:47.160
This is interesting to me, a new studio that is being set up and it's from former Blizzard

01:28:47.160 --> 01:28:49.880
staff, and here's the thing.

01:28:50.440 --> 01:28:52.600
Jay Allen Brock is one of the three.

01:28:52.600 --> 01:28:55.480
And when I heard that he was involved with this, I was kind of like, Oh, I see.

01:28:55.480 --> 01:28:58.760
He's trying to come back from a lot of it because you might remember Jay Allen Brock.

01:28:58.760 --> 01:29:01.320
He was the guy that was kind of shamed out of Blizzard.

01:29:01.320 --> 01:29:02.520
Like that's what it was really.

01:29:02.520 --> 01:29:07.800
When all the discourse came up at Blizzard and how employees are being treated and all

01:29:07.800 --> 01:29:10.440
that stuff, he really took the fall for a lot of that.

01:29:11.080 --> 01:29:13.480
And you know, he needed to.

01:29:13.480 --> 01:29:16.360
He was the face of the company for a lot of that.

01:29:16.520 --> 01:29:20.360
Mike Morhaime had been gone for a little bit, and this guy wasn't exactly good with his

01:29:20.360 --> 01:29:23.960
PR and the way that he gave speeches and stuff.

01:29:23.960 --> 01:29:25.320
So he left.

01:29:25.320 --> 01:29:32.120
And now he's teaming up with some other former Blizzard leads to make magic soup games.

01:29:32.120 --> 01:29:33.880
But here's where it gets interesting.

01:29:33.880 --> 01:29:35.640
Who are those other Blizzard leads?

01:29:36.360 --> 01:29:38.520
One of them is Jen O'Neill.

01:29:38.520 --> 01:29:47.480
Jen O'Neill was one of the two CEOs that came in to replace Jay Allen Brock.

01:29:48.920 --> 01:29:50.200
That's interesting.

01:29:50.200 --> 01:29:53.320
And that's so at first I kind of just was like, Oh, whatever.

01:29:53.320 --> 01:29:55.320
He's making a new studio, you know, whatever.

01:29:55.320 --> 01:30:00.200
And then when I saw that she's involved too, I was like, Whoa, that is a very interesting

01:30:00.200 --> 01:30:03.160
pairing because she came in to replace him.

01:30:03.160 --> 01:30:10.200
And you may recall she only stayed a year and a half, if that, and she left because

01:30:10.200 --> 01:30:16.440
she found out her and Mikey Barra, who is now the sole Blizzard CEO, were not making

01:30:16.440 --> 01:30:17.400
the same amount of money.

01:30:18.040 --> 01:30:20.280
And she put her foot down and said, I'm being underpaid.

01:30:20.280 --> 01:30:21.480
This is unfair.

01:30:21.480 --> 01:30:22.200
And she left.

01:30:22.200 --> 01:30:26.280
And it wasn't until she left that Blizzard offered to pay her the same thing.

01:30:26.280 --> 01:30:29.240
And at that point she was basically like, kiss my ass.

01:30:29.240 --> 01:30:32.520
And I don't blame her whatsoever for that.

01:30:32.600 --> 01:30:39.000
But isn't it interesting that she is teaming up with Jay Allen Brock?

01:30:40.280 --> 01:30:42.120
I just, I just find that fascinating.

01:30:42.120 --> 01:30:47.960
I mean, it's not his decision to pay, you know, like, cause if they were getting paid

01:30:47.960 --> 01:30:50.280
differently, like, is it his decision that he paid?

01:30:50.280 --> 01:30:51.480
Well, he had nothing to do with it.

01:30:51.480 --> 01:30:54.440
He, he, she came in after he was gone.

01:30:54.440 --> 01:30:54.840
Right.

01:30:54.840 --> 01:30:55.080
Yeah.

01:30:55.080 --> 01:30:56.600
So I don't know.

01:30:56.600 --> 01:30:56.920
Yeah.

01:30:56.920 --> 01:30:58.040
It's, it's interesting.

01:30:58.040 --> 01:31:03.000
And then the other person involved with this, John Donham, who did have a senior role at

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:06.280
Blizzard, I believe he's worked with like Amazon and some other companies as well.

01:31:06.920 --> 01:31:09.240
O'Neill is going to be the studio CEO.

01:31:10.360 --> 01:31:14.760
So, and she said in a statement, Jay, John, and I have similar ideas about the types of

01:31:14.760 --> 01:31:19.000
games we want to make, and we're tightly aligned on company goals and principles.

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.160
So this was a natural fit for us.

01:31:21.160 --> 01:31:24.760
We know the quality of our games will be a reflection of our team culture.

01:31:24.760 --> 01:31:28.680
We're doing the work upfront to make sure we're fostering creativity, fully remote

01:31:28.680 --> 01:31:31.240
collaboration, and a diversity of backgrounds.

01:31:33.160 --> 01:31:34.920
It's interesting to me.

01:31:34.920 --> 01:31:40.200
I mean, when she quit Blizzard, she made it sound like she wasn't coming back to the games

01:31:40.200 --> 01:31:43.640
industry or that she was going to be advocating for women in the industry.

01:31:43.640 --> 01:31:47.800
And it's not to say she hasn't done that in the last, you know, 18 months or whatever

01:31:47.800 --> 01:31:48.600
since she's left.

01:31:48.600 --> 01:31:50.120
It's just interesting.

01:31:50.440 --> 01:31:57.640
I have no other word that she's coming back and it's with him to make this company, but

01:31:57.640 --> 01:31:59.720
she's going to be the CEO this time.

01:31:59.720 --> 01:32:04.200
So it's just, I'm curious to see what they make and what their game is that they're coming

01:32:04.200 --> 01:32:05.000
up with.

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:09.560
If you, you know, to be fair, Jen O'Neill, when she was over, what was it?

01:32:09.560 --> 01:32:13.480
Vicarious Visions was where she came from and they did that Diablo 2 remaster, which

01:32:13.480 --> 01:32:14.280
was great.

01:32:14.280 --> 01:32:17.480
And a lot of the remasters that company worked on were really good.

01:32:18.200 --> 01:32:21.640
So, you know, she certainly has the resume.

01:32:23.400 --> 01:32:25.160
It's going to be interesting.

01:32:26.040 --> 01:32:27.720
I'm very interested to see what game they're making.

01:32:27.720 --> 01:32:31.240
If they're going to try to make an RPG or something that's along the lines of what Blizzard

01:32:31.240 --> 01:32:33.720
does or something completely different.

01:32:35.320 --> 01:32:36.760
Questbuster says, this is what?

01:32:36.760 --> 01:32:39.960
The second studio formed by former Blizzard devs.

01:32:39.960 --> 01:32:44.120
There was one a few months ago working on a new RPG that was put together by former

01:32:44.120 --> 01:32:45.000
WoW devs.

01:32:45.800 --> 01:32:48.680
Yeah, wasn't Chris Metzen one of them?

01:32:48.680 --> 01:32:50.280
And now isn't he back at Blizzard?

01:32:51.480 --> 01:32:53.320
I thought I heard that was a thing recently.

01:32:55.400 --> 01:32:56.440
That he had come back.

01:32:59.800 --> 01:33:02.040
Let's see, I'm trying to find like the whole.

01:33:03.880 --> 01:33:08.680
Oh, he returned to the company as a creative advisor in December 2022.

01:33:09.480 --> 01:33:11.240
So he's only an advisor there.

01:33:11.800 --> 01:33:12.300
Hmm.

01:33:13.720 --> 01:33:16.760
Warchief Games was the studio that they added.

01:33:16.760 --> 01:33:18.680
Oh, this is a whole other studio.

01:33:18.680 --> 01:33:19.000
That's right.

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:20.120
There was Frost Giant Games.

01:33:20.120 --> 01:33:24.840
I was thinking of the one of Warchief Games that did the tabletop or is going to be working

01:33:24.840 --> 01:33:25.400
on that.

01:33:25.400 --> 01:33:26.040
Very interesting.

01:33:26.040 --> 01:33:29.320
A lot of these other studios coming out of the Blizzard stuff.

01:33:29.320 --> 01:33:30.600
So we'll see.

01:33:31.320 --> 01:33:35.480
Hard to hard to say much more until we see a single frame of footage of whatever it is

01:33:35.480 --> 01:33:37.240
they're working on, and it'll be years.

01:33:37.240 --> 01:33:37.880
So we'll see.

01:33:38.600 --> 01:33:39.100
All right.

01:33:39.900 --> 01:33:44.860
Well, even though that will take years, we can reflect on years past and some of the

01:33:44.860 --> 01:33:48.860
great games that have come in years past with our next segment.

01:33:59.420 --> 01:34:04.940
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull

01:34:04.940 --> 01:34:07.180
out a classic and tell you about it.

01:34:07.260 --> 01:34:09.900
It's time for the classic game of the week.

01:34:11.340 --> 01:34:18.860
But in a twist, once a month, Dark Sakura picks a non-video game to spotlight this year

01:34:18.860 --> 01:34:19.900
in 2023.

01:34:19.900 --> 01:34:20.540
And what did you pick?

01:34:21.260 --> 01:34:22.140
I picked Simon.

01:34:23.340 --> 01:34:33.180
Um, Simon is a game that uses your short-term memory to earn points and win the game.

01:34:33.180 --> 01:34:35.260
And it makes a fart noise at you when you do badly.

01:34:35.900 --> 01:34:41.820
Um, it is, uh, it was released by Milton Bradley, now Hasbro.

01:34:42.700 --> 01:34:46.300
And, uh, contrary to popular belief, it is not called Simon Says.

01:34:46.300 --> 01:34:49.500
Simon Says is a game that you play on the playground.

01:34:50.220 --> 01:34:58.780
Um, Simon is, it's got, um, four buttons and it plays things in a sequence and anyone who

01:34:58.780 --> 01:35:03.180
has played Among Us knows that there is a version of Simon in Among Us as well.

01:35:03.180 --> 01:35:08.620
Um, but, uh, you know, it'll like start with red, you hit red and then red, green, red,

01:35:08.620 --> 01:35:10.220
green, and then red, green, green, red, green, green.

01:35:10.220 --> 01:35:14.060
You know, you have to repeat it and you have to remember the sequence.

01:35:14.060 --> 01:35:19.980
Um, but for, uh, a little bit more of, of the history behind this, basically you have

01:35:19.980 --> 01:35:24.540
to play the sequence within the time limit that it gives you or else the game is over.

01:35:25.580 --> 01:35:30.860
Um, but it was manufactured and published by Milton Bradley and then Hasbro.

01:35:30.860 --> 01:35:39.100
Um, it was, uh, the coding is in Assembly, written by, uh, Charles Capps, who also taught

01:35:39.100 --> 01:35:42.860
computer science at Temple University and wrote one of the first books on the theories

01:35:42.860 --> 01:35:44.380
of computer programming.

01:35:44.380 --> 01:35:48.300
It was launched in 1978 at Studio 54.

01:35:49.900 --> 01:35:50.620
Yep.

01:35:50.620 --> 01:35:55.500
In New York City, it was an immediate success and then it boomed all over pop culture.

01:35:56.140 --> 01:36:02.540
Um, but yeah, it, uh, uh, to have a little bit of history about it, um, there was an

01:36:02.540 --> 01:36:09.020
Atari game called Touch Me, and this was at the, uh, uh, uh, Music Operators of America

01:36:09.020 --> 01:36:11.180
trade show in 1976.

01:36:11.180 --> 01:36:15.820
And, uh, Ralph Baer and Howard Morrison were there.

01:36:15.820 --> 01:36:20.460
They said, nice gameplay, terrible execution, visually boring, miserable rasping sounds.

01:36:21.180 --> 01:36:23.100
So they bought the prototype.

01:36:24.060 --> 01:36:32.140
Um, and, uh, sorry, the, the prototype, uh, I'm sorry for this was actually built on a

01:36:32.140 --> 01:36:37.340
Texas Instruments TMS 1000 microcomputer chip, like many of the games, 1970s.

01:36:37.900 --> 01:36:42.460
And then, um, Lenny Cope, who was also one of the partners there programmed the core

01:36:42.460 --> 01:36:44.140
of the game that was called Follow Me.

01:36:44.860 --> 01:36:51.020
Um, they developed the tones, they were inspired by the sounds of a bugle.

01:36:51.020 --> 01:36:56.860
And then when they pitched the demo, um, uh, they had an eight by eight inch console and

01:36:56.860 --> 01:36:59.900
they showed Milton Bradley and they changed the name to Simon.

01:37:00.620 --> 01:37:10.540
Uh, Simon did debut 1978 at the retail price of $24 and 95 cents, which today, as I show

01:37:10.540 --> 01:37:11.980
100 Matt, that's funny.

01:37:11.980 --> 01:37:14.940
Studio 54, I'm sure people played it with their nose, if you know what I mean.

01:37:15.580 --> 01:37:18.380
Um, no, Cher played it on the back of a white horse.

01:37:18.940 --> 01:37:26.540
Um, anyway, uh, that would be the equivalent of $104 as of 2021.

01:37:26.540 --> 01:37:32.300
So it was, it was expensive, but it became one of the top selling story, uh, stories,

01:37:32.300 --> 01:37:34.060
toys for that holiday season.

01:37:34.860 --> 01:37:41.580
And its patent is, uh, 4002, uh, sorry, 4 million, 2007 and 87.

01:37:42.220 --> 01:37:48.460
Um, micro computer controlled game was, uh, it was granted its patent in 1980.

01:37:49.100 --> 01:37:54.940
And then they did, uh, others that came out, you know, after that, um, I mean, I didn't

01:37:54.940 --> 01:37:58.380
know anyone who didn't have a Simon at some point.

01:37:58.380 --> 01:37:59.420
I had a Simon.

01:38:00.140 --> 01:38:06.860
Um, I had several Simons, but we had, uh, they released like a pocket Simon and then

01:38:06.860 --> 01:38:07.900
a super Simon.

01:38:08.460 --> 01:38:13.580
I have only ever seen a super Simon once in the wild.

01:38:15.820 --> 01:38:21.100
Um, super Simon, we'll get into that in a little bit, but at any rate, there have been

01:38:21.100 --> 01:38:25.740
so many different variants since Hasbro acquired Milton Bradley in the 1980s.

01:38:26.540 --> 01:38:32.780
Um, there was again, the super Simon was a hexagonal unit with six buttons, um, only

01:38:32.780 --> 01:38:34.060
released in Europe.

01:38:34.060 --> 01:38:37.260
Like I said, I've only seen one super Simon in person.

01:38:37.980 --> 01:38:43.900
Uh, in 2000, there was Simon squared, which was a unit with the four buttons on one side

01:38:43.900 --> 01:38:45.900
and a set of eight smaller buttons on the other.

01:38:46.460 --> 01:38:52.620
2004, we had Simon sticks, which had two electronic sticks, like drumsticks and an emphasis on

01:38:52.620 --> 01:38:57.580
the musical part of the game that, uh, different, like four levels of, uh, of game play.

01:38:58.220 --> 01:38:58.860
I agree.

01:38:58.860 --> 01:39:01.260
If there was no Simon, there would be no bop it.

01:39:01.260 --> 01:39:09.100
Um, anyway, in 2005, we got Simon trickster also known as Simon tricks in, uh, Europe,

01:39:09.100 --> 01:39:11.260
UK and Simon genius in Brazil.

01:39:12.060 --> 01:39:18.060
It had four game modes that were similar to bop it and colored lenses instead of buttons.

01:39:18.620 --> 01:39:23.660
Um, there's also of course, Simon classic mode, which plays up to 35 tones.

01:39:23.660 --> 01:39:27.580
Simon bounces like Simon classic, but the colors of the lenses change.

01:39:28.300 --> 01:39:33.420
Simon surprise is probably one of the most difficult ones.

01:39:33.420 --> 01:39:36.460
Every lens is the same color and you have to memorize the location.

01:39:37.180 --> 01:39:42.700
Uh, Simon rewind, uh, requires you to memorize the sequence backwards.

01:39:43.500 --> 01:39:49.980
Um, and then you are paid a compliment after you, you finish on reaching five and 11 tones,

01:39:49.980 --> 01:39:52.860
the game will say, awesome, nice, sweet respect.

01:39:53.500 --> 01:39:57.740
Um, on 18, you get a victory melody that plays three times.

01:39:58.620 --> 01:40:06.220
Um, and then in 2011, there was Simon flash, which in this one, you have a cube, uh, the

01:40:06.220 --> 01:40:10.860
game has a four cube shaped electronic modules that the player must move around depending

01:40:10.860 --> 01:40:11.660
on the game mode.

01:40:12.460 --> 01:40:17.980
Um, 2013, they reinvented Simon one more time with Simon swipe.

01:40:18.700 --> 01:40:25.100
Um, it has a circular unit that looks like a steering wheel and the four, it extended

01:40:25.100 --> 01:40:30.380
from four buttons to eight touchscreen buttons, which are all flattened out on the unit and

01:40:30.380 --> 01:40:32.620
you play by, you know, swiping.

01:40:33.420 --> 01:40:41.900
And then there was Simon air in 2016, um, that used motion sensors, kind of like the,

01:40:41.900 --> 01:40:43.660
the loops games.

01:40:43.740 --> 01:40:46.780
And it had a solo classic multiplayer mode.

01:40:46.780 --> 01:40:54.860
Um, and it tried to retain, um, it's, uh, aesthetic when they did a button version,

01:40:54.860 --> 01:40:56.940
um, you know, kind of like the old school one.

01:40:56.940 --> 01:41:02.860
And then there was Simon optics, which is a headset motion sensor game, but you know

01:41:02.860 --> 01:41:05.260
what, let's go back to the old school.

01:41:05.980 --> 01:41:11.820
Um, so the original Simon, like I said, four colored buttons, each with a different tone

01:41:11.820 --> 01:41:16.620
when pressed or activated by the device and around in the game consists of the game lighting

01:41:16.620 --> 01:41:19.420
up in the random order, and you have to mimic that order.

01:41:20.220 --> 01:41:26.860
Um, and the name did come from the children's games, Simon says, but also based on Atari's

01:41:26.860 --> 01:41:29.180
touch me arcade game from 1974.

01:41:29.980 --> 01:41:33.660
Um, but this is just Simon.

01:41:33.660 --> 01:41:38.700
So the tones were designed to always be harmonic, no matter the sequence.

01:41:38.700 --> 01:41:43.980
And they consisted of an, a major triad and second inversion, like a trumpet fanfare.

01:41:44.940 --> 01:41:55.660
So the blue, the blue was E the yellow was C sharp at red was a and green was E, but

01:41:55.660 --> 01:41:58.620
it was an octave lower than what, uh, than the blue E.

01:41:59.420 --> 01:42:04.940
Um, and some of them though, in 1978, they did use some alternative tones and they used

01:42:04.940 --> 01:42:06.460
a B flat minor triad.

01:42:07.020 --> 01:42:08.220
So blue was B flat.

01:42:09.260 --> 01:42:10.380
Yellow was C sharp.

01:42:10.380 --> 01:42:15.740
Red was F and green was, uh, uh, the lower octave B flat.

01:42:16.380 --> 01:42:21.260
Um, and it had been re-released and redesigned and there's actually like a clear one.

01:42:21.980 --> 01:42:26.140
Um, I know for me, it's always the original Simon.

01:42:26.780 --> 01:42:33.260
Um, and then Nelsonic, which I have brought up last year as doing the, the, the watch

01:42:33.260 --> 01:42:33.660
games.

01:42:33.660 --> 01:42:34.300
Remember them?

01:42:35.260 --> 01:42:37.740
Uh, they did a Simon wristwatch version.

01:42:39.900 --> 01:42:46.780
So, um, the, you know, like I said, there were different shapes and different sizes

01:42:46.780 --> 01:42:49.340
and different ways it came out.

01:42:50.140 --> 01:42:53.100
The Simon swipe actually had a different note progression.

01:42:53.100 --> 01:43:01.980
Um, it had blue was G yellow was C red was E and green was a high octave, uh, G.

01:43:02.940 --> 01:43:06.140
Um, and there have been so many clones, so many clones.

01:43:07.020 --> 01:43:13.580
Um, Atari re-released, uh, their handheld Touch Me in 1978 with multicolored buttons

01:43:13.580 --> 01:43:14.460
and better sounds.

01:43:15.420 --> 01:43:24.540
And, um, they, uh, there was Monkey C, Monkey Do that had oval shaped buttons.

01:43:24.540 --> 01:43:29.420
Tiger electronics did copycats in 1979 with a transparent case and used buzzards.

01:43:29.420 --> 01:43:33.180
It was also re-released by Sears as Follow Me, which was the original name.

01:43:33.820 --> 01:43:40.780
Um, and then there was Copycat Jr. and Pocket Repeat by Tandy Computers as in Tandy from

01:43:40.780 --> 01:43:41.500
Radio Shack.

01:43:42.460 --> 01:43:44.700
Um, Castle Toys had Einstein.

01:43:44.700 --> 01:43:47.020
Genius came out in Brazil in the eighties.

01:43:47.020 --> 01:43:49.420
Space Echo was by some company.

01:43:50.220 --> 01:43:54.620
Um, there was a DIY version out there that you could solder together.

01:43:55.420 --> 01:44:01.500
Um, another DIY called Electronic Memory Game that was based on the Arm Cortex, uh, microcontrollers.

01:44:02.460 --> 01:44:07.740
Uh, Game A mode on the second game in the Game & Watch handheld was Flagman.

01:44:07.740 --> 01:44:10.860
Game B, uh, is the same, but it doesn't play in sequence.

01:44:10.860 --> 01:44:13.820
You have a limited time to respond to where it lifts up.

01:44:13.820 --> 01:44:17.740
It was R2D2 Ditto Droid, which is a Star Wars version.

01:44:17.740 --> 01:44:21.020
And this was released by Tiger Electronics in 1987.

01:44:21.740 --> 01:44:27.420
Uh, there's a side quest in the SNES and Game Boy Advance versions of Donkey Kong Country 3,

01:44:27.420 --> 01:44:32.700
Dixie Kong's Double Trouble that had, that was called like Banana Birds and you had to

01:44:32.700 --> 01:44:34.380
use the different buttons on your controller.

01:44:35.100 --> 01:44:43.740
Uh, Soviet company Electronica, um, IE01 Evolga, which was almost an exact replica of Simon.

01:44:43.740 --> 01:44:46.700
Oddworld Games had very similar puzzles.

01:44:47.500 --> 01:44:50.460
Um, sequences also were on several other handhelds.

01:44:50.460 --> 01:44:52.860
Just all kinds of Parker Brothers games, Atari.

01:44:53.420 --> 01:44:58.300
There was a, there was a Toytronics Gotcha, which was very similar.

01:44:59.020 --> 01:45:07.420
Um, and then, uh, the audio will, will play consistently and then some will actually kind

01:45:07.420 --> 01:45:07.900
of cut down.

01:45:07.900 --> 01:45:14.140
There's some that use dog sounds, cats, pigs, cows, xylophones, different kinds of space

01:45:14.140 --> 01:45:14.540
sounds.

01:45:15.180 --> 01:45:19.500
Um, but also it had a very big involvement in, uh, pop culture.

01:45:20.460 --> 01:45:27.740
Um, in the book, the Tommyknockers that came out in 1987 by Stephen King, uh, someone had

01:45:27.740 --> 01:45:34.940
left a Simon in the back seat of a reporter's car that activated itself and went into a

01:45:34.940 --> 01:45:38.140
frenzy overheating and melting and scorched the seat.

01:45:38.780 --> 01:45:42.220
The driver then knocks it to the floor before it goes up in flames.

01:45:42.940 --> 01:45:45.900
Uh, and it's always sunny in Philadelphia.

01:45:45.900 --> 01:45:49.740
Um, someone finds a Simon in the closet, uh, Little Miss Gamer.

01:45:50.460 --> 01:45:55.980
Uh, Simon, uh, uh, actually had characters meeting up.

01:45:56.700 --> 01:46:02.620
A family guy was in, American Dad, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, Cougar Town, Paranormal

01:46:02.620 --> 01:46:03.020
Activity.

01:46:03.020 --> 01:46:05.660
There was a possessed Simon that worked as a Ouija board.

01:46:06.220 --> 01:46:10.860
A robot chicken, Dick Cheney's heart was replaced with a Simon, like as in Iron Man.

01:46:12.380 --> 01:46:13.180
You remember, right?

01:46:13.900 --> 01:46:16.460
No, I just, robot chicken players.

01:46:16.460 --> 01:46:20.860
I mean, there was some in British T-shows, there's a mini game in Sabrina the Teenage

01:46:20.860 --> 01:46:22.220
Witch for Game Boy Advance.

01:46:22.780 --> 01:46:27.900
Uh, even in, uh, South Park, The Stick of Truth, you had to play Simon to rescue Randy

01:46:27.900 --> 01:46:29.100
Marsh from an alien probe.

01:46:29.900 --> 01:46:35.180
Uh, Quicktime Events, uh, The Island, Despicable Me, Veronica, which is a Spanish movie.

01:46:35.740 --> 01:46:37.660
Uh, I'll just, all kinds of stuff.

01:46:37.660 --> 01:46:40.460
And then of course, like I said, there was the sequence in Among Us.

01:46:41.340 --> 01:46:47.100
Um, I like how it says it, in late 2020, the popular game Among Us featured a mini game

01:46:47.100 --> 01:46:49.100
loosely based on the design of Simon.

01:46:49.100 --> 01:46:52.780
However, most players mistakenly referred to it as Simon Says.

01:46:54.140 --> 01:46:56.860
It's kind of a pet peeve, but I don't say too much about it.

01:46:57.420 --> 01:47:00.940
Um, but yeah, it's, there you go.

01:47:01.820 --> 01:47:04.700
Oh gosh, it was even in Heart to Heart, and I kind of remember this.

01:47:05.660 --> 01:47:10.060
Um, it was in the season to be murdered, the Hearts play, uh, a fake Simon.

01:47:11.420 --> 01:47:17.740
And then games magazine, uh, included Simon in their top 100 games of 1980 and called

01:47:17.740 --> 01:47:20.300
it the original electronic follow the leader game.

01:47:21.260 --> 01:47:23.740
Um, I have a question.

01:47:23.740 --> 01:47:26.700
I know you've talked a lot about this and we want to get back into the news, but I'm

01:47:26.700 --> 01:47:30.620
genuinely curious after looking at this video where some person in the camera is extremely

01:47:30.620 --> 01:47:33.260
shaky and, uh, they're showing all their things.

01:47:34.300 --> 01:47:34.860
Yeah, no, no, no.

01:47:34.860 --> 01:47:39.660
I'm not even, I found a different one because they show the super Simon and I'm super curious

01:47:39.660 --> 01:47:42.060
because I never played one of these, but you referenced it.

01:47:42.060 --> 01:47:42.780
Like what?

01:47:42.780 --> 01:47:46.620
I mean, this thing looks weird because there's like up and down colors.

01:47:46.620 --> 01:47:48.540
What, what was super about super Simon?

01:47:49.580 --> 01:47:50.700
Barely remember.

01:47:50.700 --> 01:47:55.580
I was a kid and one of my friends who grew up in, in England had one.

01:47:56.620 --> 01:47:58.940
Um, God, how old was I?

01:47:58.940 --> 01:48:00.060
I have to think about it now.

01:48:00.700 --> 01:48:01.980
Super Simon.

01:48:01.980 --> 01:48:04.700
Um, yeah, I'm just trying to figure out.

01:48:04.700 --> 01:48:08.540
It's all right if you don't remember, but this looks so different than the others.

01:48:08.540 --> 01:48:16.620
It was, yeah, it was like this big long strip and yeah, I barely remember anything about

01:48:16.620 --> 01:48:17.180
it.

01:48:17.180 --> 01:48:19.420
I just remembered that one of my friends had it.

01:48:20.220 --> 01:48:21.420
How old was I?

01:48:21.420 --> 01:48:23.420
I had to have been like six.

01:48:23.420 --> 01:48:25.580
I know they came out in the late seventies.

01:48:25.580 --> 01:48:27.100
Super Simon came out in 79.

01:48:28.300 --> 01:48:34.380
Um, and yeah, I just remembered not being very good at it, but we would play it together.

01:48:34.380 --> 01:48:35.180
We would take turns.

01:48:35.740 --> 01:48:36.620
Interesting.

01:48:36.620 --> 01:48:40.700
Uh, I thought I liked this perspective too from bonds, double six and chat, and I don't

01:48:40.700 --> 01:48:45.100
know if this is Simon influence or just the colors, but I thought this was interesting.

01:48:45.100 --> 01:48:50.940
Bon's double six says those colors are imprinted into so many of the everyday visuals we deal

01:48:50.940 --> 01:48:54.060
with controller button colors for video games.

01:48:54.060 --> 01:48:56.940
And that is, that is a very good point.

01:48:56.940 --> 01:49:00.300
I just so happen to have an Xbox series X controller right here.

01:49:00.300 --> 01:49:05.900
And if you look at the buttons for X, Y, B, and A red, yellow, green, blue, just like

01:49:05.900 --> 01:49:06.380
a Simon.

01:49:06.380 --> 01:49:10.700
Now, granted, you could say that, well, it's the primary, it's the RGB and the primary

01:49:10.700 --> 01:49:13.340
goes, but I mean, there's no purple, there's no orange.

01:49:13.900 --> 01:49:14.700
I know, I know.

01:49:14.700 --> 01:49:15.580
But you know what I mean?

01:49:15.580 --> 01:49:18.220
Either it's primary light or primary, you know, um,

01:49:18.220 --> 01:49:22.220
But look at the Japanese, um, SNES color scheme.

01:49:22.860 --> 01:49:26.060
It had the colored buttons on it and the little logo on the side.

01:49:26.060 --> 01:49:26.460
Yeah.

01:49:26.460 --> 01:49:28.780
It was, it's, it was those colors.

01:49:28.780 --> 01:49:31.340
I mean, I've sampled those colors directly for my channel.

01:49:31.340 --> 01:49:35.260
You know, they are a red, yellow, blue, and green.

01:49:36.540 --> 01:49:42.860
And so it's just, I don't know if it's an influence from Simon as much as it is an influence

01:49:42.860 --> 01:49:44.460
of general aesthetics.

01:49:45.260 --> 01:49:50.220
They're just colors that, well, I mean, red and green are actually opposites on the color

01:49:50.220 --> 01:49:55.740
wheel, um, which means that side by side, they actually would cause a little bit of

01:49:55.740 --> 01:49:59.100
mental discomfort, which true story.

01:49:59.100 --> 01:50:01.580
That's why Freddy Krueger's sweater is red and green.

01:50:02.220 --> 01:50:03.100
Oh, I didn't know that.

01:50:03.820 --> 01:50:04.140
Yeah.

01:50:04.140 --> 01:50:05.340
Gotta love Christmas.

01:50:05.340 --> 01:50:05.820
All right.

01:50:05.820 --> 01:50:08.860
Uh, those are the colors you see everywhere Christmas.

01:50:08.860 --> 01:50:09.580
All right.

01:50:09.580 --> 01:50:13.900
Anyway, um, Simon, long history for that game.

01:50:14.620 --> 01:50:18.940
See it referenced not just in pop culture, but in other video games, including very recent

01:50:18.940 --> 01:50:19.980
things like among us.

01:50:19.980 --> 01:50:20.380
Yeah.

01:50:20.380 --> 01:50:21.740
Huge influence to that game.

01:50:21.740 --> 01:50:23.100
So, all right.

01:50:23.100 --> 01:50:26.700
A great segment for the classic not video game game.

01:50:27.340 --> 01:50:27.740
All right.

01:50:27.740 --> 01:50:31.420
Let's travel around back to video games and talk about some other news going on in the

01:50:31.420 --> 01:50:33.980
industry in a segment we call rapid fire news.

01:50:33.980 --> 01:50:34.780
We'll go to Loki.

01:50:35.580 --> 01:50:35.820
Yeah.

01:50:35.820 --> 01:50:39.580
So start with March's PlayStation plus update.

01:50:39.580 --> 01:50:44.700
It's going to be adding lots of big games, including, uh, ghost wire Tokyo, which we

01:50:44.700 --> 01:50:52.060
just talked about was coming to Xbox, uh, rage to immortals, Phoenix rising and, uh, some

01:50:52.060 --> 01:50:53.660
other stuff on there as well.

01:50:53.660 --> 01:50:54.140
Let's see.

01:50:55.500 --> 01:50:58.460
Um, uncharted legacy of thieves collection.

01:50:58.460 --> 01:50:59.020
Pretty cool.

01:50:59.020 --> 01:51:02.060
Rainbow six extraction, uh, life is strange.

01:51:02.060 --> 01:51:02.860
True colors.

01:51:02.860 --> 01:51:05.020
Life is strange to Dragon ball.

01:51:05.020 --> 01:51:09.180
Z cock rot street fighter five championship edition.

01:51:09.180 --> 01:51:11.660
Untitled goose game, uh, final fantasy type.

01:51:11.660 --> 01:51:12.380
Oh, HD.

01:51:12.380 --> 01:51:13.020
That's a game.

01:51:13.020 --> 01:51:13.500
I forgot.

01:51:13.500 --> 01:51:18.060
I bought, um, Neo the world ends with you and Haven.

01:51:18.700 --> 01:51:22.620
And then of course three new classic PlayStation games coming as well.

01:51:23.500 --> 01:51:30.140
I mean, only the best Ridge racer game ever Ridge racer type four, uh, April Academy two

01:51:30.140 --> 01:51:33.580
for PSP and safe and filter dark mirror for PSP.

01:51:34.860 --> 01:51:36.460
Seriously, Namco Bandai.

01:51:37.820 --> 01:51:40.700
Why no, why no new Ridge racer game?

01:51:40.700 --> 01:51:41.900
This makes me very sad.

01:51:42.460 --> 01:51:44.140
Why, why do I have to wait so long?

01:51:44.700 --> 01:51:50.460
Give us a full remaster of our four and, and find some way to bring in the jog con

01:51:50.460 --> 01:51:51.260
compatibility.

01:51:52.060 --> 01:51:57.500
Can we just have them sell the Ridge racer franchise to the team that makes Forza horizons,

01:51:57.500 --> 01:52:00.460
please just do that.

01:52:00.460 --> 01:52:02.300
Like that would be, make everybody happy.

01:52:02.940 --> 01:52:05.260
Force has kind of made a name for itself at this point though.

01:52:05.260 --> 01:52:05.980
So I don't know.

01:52:05.980 --> 01:52:07.020
I don't know if you're interested.

01:52:08.140 --> 01:52:10.620
I need to just re-listen to the R4 soundtrack.

01:52:10.620 --> 01:52:11.900
It is so good.

01:52:11.900 --> 01:52:12.400
Yeah.

01:52:13.420 --> 01:52:13.920
All right.

01:52:14.540 --> 01:52:18.860
And then, um, we've got some more news regarding the next silent Hill movie.

01:52:18.860 --> 01:52:21.260
They have some of the cast, uh, picked out.

01:52:21.260 --> 01:52:22.380
That's correct.

01:52:22.380 --> 01:52:29.820
So now we're going to have Jeremy, um, Irvine as, I guess, James and, uh, Hannah, Emily

01:52:29.820 --> 01:52:35.020
Anderson, who was in jigsaw, uh, who was going to be the co-star.

01:52:35.020 --> 01:52:37.900
I'm not sure, uh, who she is playing though.

01:52:41.660 --> 01:52:44.540
Or maybe they're leaving it open for her to play multiple roles.

01:52:45.180 --> 01:52:45.900
Maybe, maybe.

01:52:45.900 --> 01:52:46.380
Who knows?

01:52:47.260 --> 01:52:51.020
Um, but that, that's interesting that they are, uh, yeah.

01:52:51.020 --> 01:52:55.100
Taking this movie further and actually going to do it.

01:52:55.100 --> 01:52:56.060
It sounds like so.

01:52:56.780 --> 01:52:57.280
Yeah.

01:52:57.500 --> 01:53:00.620
This was supposed to be pretty true to silent Hill two where it's the original movie.

01:53:00.620 --> 01:53:02.540
And again, I liked the original movie.

01:53:02.540 --> 01:53:06.540
Um, but it wasn't like it was kind of the plot of the first game.

01:53:06.540 --> 01:53:06.780
Right.

01:53:06.780 --> 01:53:09.340
But like, didn't they, they make some pretty big changes to it.

01:53:09.340 --> 01:53:09.820
So I don't know.

01:53:09.820 --> 01:53:11.900
It seems like they want to pyramid head in there.

01:53:11.900 --> 01:53:12.300
Yeah.

01:53:12.300 --> 01:53:12.780
Yeah.

01:53:12.780 --> 01:53:13.500
There were a number.

01:53:13.500 --> 01:53:17.900
I think, I think the, the, you know, pyramid, I'm actually going to quote

01:53:17.900 --> 01:53:19.580
Shayla and start calling him pyramid guy.

01:53:20.300 --> 01:53:25.340
Um, pyramid guy was, was in there, I think more for the sake of fan service.

01:53:25.900 --> 01:53:26.860
Which is fine.

01:53:26.860 --> 01:53:32.140
You have them there in the trailer that, and honestly, the, the purpose of the character

01:53:32.140 --> 01:53:37.180
in silent Hill two was there as a punisher and executioner.

01:53:37.900 --> 01:53:42.460
So it fits in and it was actually part of the town's mythos.

01:53:42.460 --> 01:53:47.420
So I don't see any reason for it to not be in a non silent Hill related, you know, silent

01:53:47.420 --> 01:53:49.020
Hill two related story.

01:53:49.020 --> 01:53:51.660
So were they going to still make the second movie as canon?

01:53:51.660 --> 01:53:52.780
Cause I don't even remember.

01:53:52.780 --> 01:53:54.620
I never watched the second movie.

01:53:54.620 --> 01:53:55.740
I watched the first one.

01:53:55.740 --> 01:53:56.460
I love the first one.

01:53:56.460 --> 01:54:00.300
You mean the one that was based off three, the 3d revelation or whatever it's called.

01:54:00.860 --> 01:54:05.820
I liked that one because I liked Heather, Cheryl, Heather, Mason.

01:54:05.820 --> 01:54:07.580
I thought there was a second silent Hill movie.

01:54:07.580 --> 01:54:10.060
It was, it was that it was based off three.

01:54:10.060 --> 01:54:10.380
Yeah.

01:54:10.380 --> 01:54:11.260
Oh, okay.

01:54:12.220 --> 01:54:15.420
And I really, I mean, it's not a great movie.

01:54:15.420 --> 01:54:21.020
I'll admit that, but I like it because I silent Hill three is my favorite of the series.

01:54:21.020 --> 01:54:29.500
I love seeing things from a, a rebellious, strong, young teenager, you know, who's going

01:54:29.500 --> 01:54:33.020
out and thrown into this world and dealing with all of this shit.

01:54:33.020 --> 01:54:33.520
Yeah.

01:54:34.060 --> 01:54:39.980
I'm, I'm very curious to see what they do with the, this, you know, supposedly loyal

01:54:39.980 --> 01:54:41.500
adaptation of silent Hill two.

01:54:41.500 --> 01:54:42.060
We'll see.

01:54:42.060 --> 01:54:46.300
We'll see, especially in a year where we know we're getting, you know, as Jason kind of

01:54:46.300 --> 01:54:48.460
referenced in the intro, it's the year of silent Hill.

01:54:48.460 --> 01:54:52.220
We already know, like they're working on all of these other projects, including a silent

01:54:52.220 --> 01:54:53.180
Hill two remaster.

01:54:53.740 --> 01:54:59.100
Oh, just add that to the fucking list from earlier in the show for this year.

01:54:59.100 --> 01:54:59.600
Jesus.

01:55:00.220 --> 01:55:04.300
What a year, like going from like, oh gosh, like years where it's like, can we please

01:55:04.300 --> 01:55:05.420
get a new silent Hill game?

01:55:05.420 --> 01:55:08.140
They're like, we're going to give you so many silent Hill games.

01:55:08.140 --> 01:55:08.940
It's like, okay.

01:55:08.940 --> 01:55:13.820
I can't believe when I was going over all those 20, 23 games earlier, I didn't name

01:55:13.820 --> 01:55:15.020
a single silent Hill game.

01:55:15.660 --> 01:55:17.100
Just add that to the list.

01:55:17.100 --> 01:55:21.340
There's so much that we're going to forget about that's coming out like, oh yeah, that's

01:55:21.340 --> 01:55:21.740
right.

01:55:21.740 --> 01:55:22.540
That's a thing.

01:55:22.540 --> 01:55:26.620
And some games are going to suffer because this year is too stacked.

01:55:27.900 --> 01:55:28.940
That's the weird thing.

01:55:28.940 --> 01:55:29.440
Fine.

01:55:30.780 --> 01:55:34.220
I hope you all saved your PTO from during the pandemic because you're going to be burning

01:55:34.220 --> 01:55:35.820
it on video games this year.

01:55:35.820 --> 01:55:39.020
All right.

01:55:40.620 --> 01:55:40.940
Let's see.

01:55:40.940 --> 01:55:43.180
We have other rapid fire news, I think for Dark Sakura.

01:55:44.140 --> 01:55:44.640
Yeah.

01:55:45.420 --> 01:55:49.340
There is a new Tekken 8 trailer that has martial law coming back.

01:55:50.460 --> 01:55:52.140
I love the character of martial law.

01:55:52.140 --> 01:55:54.300
I think he looks way too yoked out in this though.

01:55:56.060 --> 01:56:00.140
Like I, the thing I always liked about martial law and forest law is that they were the,

01:56:00.140 --> 01:56:03.020
you know, the sleek Bruce Lee type, like almost completely.

01:56:03.980 --> 01:56:10.780
And he's, he looks like someone took anabolic steroids and gave him a freaking, uh, IV full

01:56:10.780 --> 01:56:11.280
of them.

01:56:12.780 --> 01:56:14.220
He took whatever Bane's taking.

01:56:15.100 --> 01:56:20.700
But I had to see this for myself on, uh, the YouTube that they released here, just to see

01:56:20.700 --> 01:56:21.740
what you're talking about here.

01:56:22.460 --> 01:56:24.220
Does he not look like super yoked?

01:56:24.220 --> 01:56:25.340
Yeah, a little bit, a little bit.

01:56:26.140 --> 01:56:31.980
But, but I always liked the character and, you know, I got out of Tekken right around,

01:56:31.980 --> 01:56:33.340
I'd say Tekken 5.

01:56:33.340 --> 01:56:37.260
Oh no, I hate that poppy, veiny look.

01:56:39.260 --> 01:56:41.020
Not a fan, not a fan of that look.

01:56:41.020 --> 01:56:41.740
I'm with you.

01:56:41.740 --> 01:56:42.300
Love the character.

01:56:42.300 --> 01:56:42.860
Don't love this.

01:56:43.500 --> 01:56:49.420
But I've seen some really neat stuff in this and especially, you know, my man Jean looks

01:56:49.420 --> 01:56:50.380
uh, pretty hot.

01:56:51.260 --> 01:56:56.540
So I think that I would, this might be the one that gets me back into Tekken.

01:56:56.540 --> 01:56:57.040
Yeah.

01:56:58.380 --> 01:57:00.620
Ooh, Darts of Steel with an interesting point here.

01:57:01.180 --> 01:57:05.980
I'm reminded of that BS story about Fei Long not being in Street Fighter 6.

01:57:05.980 --> 01:57:08.060
I want to, I remember that whole drama.

01:57:08.620 --> 01:57:11.580
I want to say martial law was the same kind of character.

01:57:11.580 --> 01:57:12.080
Yeah.

01:57:12.700 --> 01:57:16.300
So it's interesting that that BS story didn't follow over here, but anyway.

01:57:17.260 --> 01:57:17.760
Yeah.

01:57:18.220 --> 01:57:24.140
Well, I mean, I, I see, I don't really know what the difference would be.

01:57:24.140 --> 01:57:27.580
I think there's got to be some other reason, but I don't think it has to do with like,

01:57:28.060 --> 01:57:33.980
I mean, martial law and forest law started off kind of similar, but they also had like

01:57:33.980 --> 01:57:37.340
the backstory of cooking and all this other stuff going on.

01:57:37.340 --> 01:57:38.940
So maybe they were different enough.

01:57:38.940 --> 01:57:39.440
Yeah.

01:57:40.140 --> 01:57:43.980
Um, moving on to something very different than what we're used to, at least with the

01:57:43.980 --> 01:57:45.500
pre-orders in the United States.

01:57:45.500 --> 01:57:49.900
And that is a pre-order that Amazon Japan, a pre-order bonus that Amazon Japan is offering

01:57:49.900 --> 01:57:53.020
for, excuse me, Zelda Tears of the Kingdom.

01:57:53.020 --> 01:57:55.420
And that is a spoon and a fork.

01:57:55.420 --> 01:58:00.700
Now, before you giggle at the concept of a spoon and fork being a pre-order item, there's

01:58:00.700 --> 01:58:04.220
silverware seems to be a common theme with some Japanese pre-orders.

01:58:04.220 --> 01:58:08.860
I remember when Dark Sakura had that game for the Dreamcast, the Saturn.

01:58:09.900 --> 01:58:10.700
It was Counter Sakura.

01:58:10.700 --> 01:58:10.940
That's right.

01:58:10.940 --> 01:58:13.820
Came with like a whole fricking dish and everything else.

01:58:13.820 --> 01:58:17.340
Um, and then I think I saw on Twitter, I think I just saw him in chat, uh, Shane.

01:58:17.340 --> 01:58:17.660
Yeah.

01:58:17.660 --> 01:58:20.860
Who said, uh, who's also waiting for the short message message game.

01:58:20.860 --> 01:58:27.900
I want to say Shane had posted that a Pokemon out in Japan had a fork and a spoon too, scarlet

01:58:27.900 --> 01:58:28.540
and violet.

01:58:28.540 --> 01:58:30.460
So this isn't exactly unheard of.

01:58:30.460 --> 01:58:34.940
It's just not something you often see in the U S as a pre-order bonus.

01:58:34.940 --> 01:58:40.060
Sakura Taisen that came out, um, at the same time that that Cardcaptor Sakura game came

01:58:40.060 --> 01:58:42.300
out also had a big bonus set like that.

01:58:42.300 --> 01:58:42.620
Yeah.

01:58:42.620 --> 01:58:42.860
Yeah.

01:58:42.860 --> 01:58:49.420
My, my Cardcaptor Sakura came with, um, a pillowcase, a fork and a knife, a bowl and

01:58:49.420 --> 01:58:50.460
a pillowcase cover.

01:58:50.940 --> 01:58:51.420
A pillowcase.

01:58:52.380 --> 01:58:52.860
Why not?

01:58:53.820 --> 01:58:54.620
So why not?

01:58:54.620 --> 01:58:55.100
Why not?

01:58:55.100 --> 01:58:56.060
There you go.

01:58:56.060 --> 01:58:56.300
All right.

01:58:56.300 --> 01:59:00.540
Well, we'll check out some other, uh, limited edition releases because they love limited

01:59:00.540 --> 01:59:01.980
edition releases in Japan.

01:59:01.980 --> 01:59:05.900
There's always like every game you, you hear me read those release dates every week.

01:59:05.900 --> 01:59:07.740
Like every other game has a limited edition.

01:59:07.740 --> 01:59:11.660
We'll get into some of those, but first let's go to the U S and check out some, uh, releases

01:59:11.660 --> 01:59:12.620
for the U S this week.

01:59:13.420 --> 01:59:17.580
This week we have mighty doom coming out on iOS and Android.

01:59:17.580 --> 01:59:19.660
That's the cute little doom game that they're putting out.

01:59:20.140 --> 01:59:23.900
Uh, remnant from the ashes for Nintendo switch.

01:59:23.900 --> 01:59:33.260
We have Chichia on a PC PlayStation four and PlayStation five have a nice death on PC and

And it looks like a leader of the week.

02:00:03.740 --> 02:00:09.660
We also have the outlier Risa three, uh, coming out on, uh, looks like PC, Nintendo switch

02:00:09.660 --> 02:00:11.260

02:00:11.260 --> 02:00:13.900
Maybe one physical one digital or something like that.

02:00:14.460 --> 02:00:17.820
Uh, which, uh, Oh, the first one is for Japan.

02:00:17.820 --> 02:00:18.320
There we go.

02:00:18.860 --> 02:00:24.380
So you asking it slightly a little bit later resident evil for the remake finally coming

out on PC, PlayStation four, PlayStation five and Xbox series.

02:00:29.420 --> 02:00:30.940
And I believe that's it for the week.

02:00:31.980 --> 02:00:32.300
All right.

02:00:32.300 --> 02:00:35.820
Heading to Japan and checking out some of the releases on the Nintendo switch at layer

02:00:35.820 --> 02:00:41.580
Risa three is out, uh, pretty much everywhere, uh, in Japan in a regular premium box and

Uh, SD Shin common writer rumble is also out this week from bandai Namco, uh, in Japan

02:00:58.780 --> 02:01:00.060
on the switch this week.

02:01:00.060 --> 02:01:04.860
And if you're a fan of NBA two K 23, well, it gets a price reduction, uh, it goes into

02:01:04.860 --> 02:01:07.100
the two K collection in Japan this week.

02:01:07.100 --> 02:01:11.660
Uh, so you can check that out if you haven't already over on the PlayStation five in Japan,

02:01:11.660 --> 02:01:16.460
similar titles at layer Risa three, also out on, uh, the PlayStation five, as well as grim

02:01:16.460 --> 02:01:22.380
guardians, demon purge, but also coming to the PlayStation five R type final three evolved

02:01:22.380 --> 02:01:25.580
also getting a multilingual edition out in Japan this week.

02:01:25.580 --> 02:01:30.540
And then that biohazard re four, cause remember they call the series biohazard over there.

02:01:30.540 --> 02:01:36.620
What we call resident evil that is also coming out in Japan this week, uh, for the PlayStation

02:01:36.620 --> 02:01:36.940
five.

02:01:36.940 --> 02:01:42.780
And yes, there is a deluxe edition and a collector's edition also available in Japan.

02:01:42.780 --> 02:01:46.300
I was just looking to see if that collector's edition includes a knife and a fork.

02:01:46.300 --> 02:01:49.900
I'm sorry to say it does not, but it does look like it has a little crate.

02:01:49.900 --> 02:01:51.980
This looks like one of those crates that sits on the map.

02:01:51.980 --> 02:01:58.220
When you play against Wesker in a deadline that you get with this collector's edition

02:01:58.220 --> 02:01:59.820
here for a resident evil.

02:01:59.820 --> 02:02:03.740
So, but that's what can sit on the shelf.

02:02:03.740 --> 02:02:05.820
Uh, there's also that whole Leon statue.

02:02:05.820 --> 02:02:06.700
That's pretty cool.

02:02:06.700 --> 02:02:11.020
I got to say, I mean, I have to have less physical stuff in my house, but that Leon

02:02:11.020 --> 02:02:12.620
statue does look pretty cool.

02:02:12.620 --> 02:02:17.500
So I have to say that going back to, um, the, uh, our type final three.

02:02:17.500 --> 02:02:18.000
Yeah.

02:02:18.540 --> 02:02:25.500
Um, apparently people name video games the way I named my art files final.

02:02:25.500 --> 02:02:29.660
No, really the final, uh, the extra final, final part two, final part three.

02:02:30.620 --> 02:02:32.700
They should just give up no more finals.

02:02:33.740 --> 02:02:38.300
Um, interesting comment from, uh, DJ Roma S before we get to the UK dates, uh, asking

02:02:38.300 --> 02:02:44.780
about the grim guardian games to didn't, they change the name to, uh, gal guardians.

02:02:44.780 --> 02:02:48.940
Uh, they actually changed the name, you know, when I'm looking at this list of releases,

02:02:48.940 --> 02:02:51.740
they are still, and this could be a Japan versus us thing.

02:02:51.740 --> 02:02:55.260
Cause remember I am reading Japanese releases, but they actually show the

02:02:55.740 --> 02:02:58.460
box art here still stating that it's grim guardians.

02:02:58.460 --> 02:03:03.740
So I don't know if maybe, I don't know, but yeah, that's what it's showing the box art

02:03:03.740 --> 02:03:04.060
there.

02:03:04.060 --> 02:03:07.020
So it could be, it could be something that they just changed here.

02:03:07.020 --> 02:03:08.140
Uh, I don't know.

02:03:08.140 --> 02:03:08.640
Interesting.

02:03:09.980 --> 02:03:10.460
Uh, moving on.

02:03:10.460 --> 02:03:11.740
How about the UK Darzaka?

02:03:13.420 --> 02:03:18.700
Um, let's see in the UK, I really a handful of things on the 21st for switch.

02:03:18.700 --> 02:03:20.300
We have remnant from the ashes.

02:03:20.860 --> 02:03:25.500
Also, um, the 23rd for the switch Ravens burger memory.

02:03:26.300 --> 02:03:29.820
Uh, on PlayStation and switch, we have crazy chicken cart too.

02:03:30.460 --> 02:03:32.300
On the 24th for switch.

02:03:32.300 --> 02:03:34.460
I'm sorry for PlayStation and X-Box.

02:03:34.460 --> 02:03:36.860
We have resident evil for remake steel book edition.

02:03:37.500 --> 02:03:41.020
Um, for PlayStation, we have tournament boy commits tax evasion.

02:03:41.020 --> 02:03:42.140
I just think that's the best name.

02:03:42.860 --> 02:03:47.660
Um, and again, on the 24th, uh, for PlayStation and switch.

02:03:47.740 --> 02:03:53.340
I'll tell you, uh, I'll tell you Risa three alchemist of the end and secret key.

02:03:56.460 --> 02:04:02.380
All right, let's move on and get a few more stories and then maybe some phone calls.

02:04:02.380 --> 02:04:07.020
If you want to call in later in the show over at vog network.com slash discord, you can

02:04:07.020 --> 02:04:11.340
always join the green room and, uh, join the discord conversations throughout the week.

02:04:11.340 --> 02:04:14.860
Uh, some of our stories tonight coming from the orange launch radio channel on discord,

02:04:14.860 --> 02:04:19.180
cause you all like the, uh, the piece on, um, magic spoon games I talked about earlier.

02:04:19.180 --> 02:04:21.180
No magic soup games, not magic spoon.

02:04:21.180 --> 02:04:23.020
I'm getting confused with the Zelda pre-order.

02:04:23.020 --> 02:04:26.140
Uh, but the magic soup games came from the, uh, discord.

02:04:26.140 --> 02:04:27.260
Somebody had posted that the other night.

02:04:27.260 --> 02:04:29.180
So, and I was like, Oh, I hadn't heard about this.

02:04:29.180 --> 02:04:32.620
So, uh, thank you all who participate in our discord server throughout the week.

02:04:32.620 --> 02:04:34.300
Vog network.com slash discord.

02:04:34.300 --> 02:04:37.340
And you can call in by joining the green room in just a moment.

02:04:37.340 --> 02:04:38.860
We still have about 10 minutes before we get there.

02:04:38.860 --> 02:04:40.860
Cause we still have a few more stories.

02:04:40.860 --> 02:04:41.660
Let's go to Loki.

02:04:42.540 --> 02:04:42.780
Yeah.

02:04:42.780 --> 02:04:49.980
So Blizzard has banned about 120,000 world of Warcraft, um, bot accounts that were using

02:04:49.980 --> 02:04:54.540
the definite class of farm resources from wrath of the Lich King classic.

02:04:54.540 --> 02:04:59.580
Um, they said, you know, we felt it was very important for the launch of wrath of the Lich

02:04:59.580 --> 02:05:04.780
King classic to give anyone who wanted to hop in this iconic expansion, the ability to do so

02:05:04.780 --> 02:05:09.820
with few barriers as possible, allowing every account to access the death night,

02:05:09.820 --> 02:05:13.420
even if they did not meet the historical requirements, it was important.

02:05:13.420 --> 02:05:18.460
However, now that the initial launch period is passed, we no longer wish to allow unrestricted

02:05:18.460 --> 02:05:24.300
creation of death nights on brand new accounts is tempting, or it was an attempting vector

02:05:24.300 --> 02:05:29.660
for malicious actors to use to get into the game and start exploiting very quickly.

02:05:29.660 --> 02:05:33.260
So they're no longer allowing you to create a death night.

02:05:33.260 --> 02:05:36.540
Um, from the get go, you still have to go through the process to do it.

02:05:37.340 --> 02:05:43.100
The normal method, I guess to, you know, stop, stop the body counts, I guess.

02:05:44.140 --> 02:05:47.500
This is funny because I remember doing this in classic wow.

02:05:47.500 --> 02:05:53.100
Like when this game was live, I remember rolling death nights to have alt characters that could

02:05:53.100 --> 02:05:57.020
do farming, like, you know, with stuff that maybe I don't have otherwise.

02:05:57.020 --> 02:06:02.060
Like if I, my main character had, uh, herbalism, alchemy, maybe I have a death night who could

02:06:02.060 --> 02:06:04.460
do mining and pick that up really fast.

02:06:04.540 --> 02:06:08.140
But again, you had to have a character at level 55 in the original one.

02:06:08.140 --> 02:06:10.780
So you, you had to go up through the ranks originally anyway.

02:06:10.780 --> 02:06:14.060
So I mean, you're just kind of reverting back to that basically.

02:06:14.060 --> 02:06:14.700
So yeah.

02:06:15.420 --> 02:06:16.460
All right.

02:06:16.460 --> 02:06:17.420
Dark Sakura.

02:06:18.780 --> 02:06:22.700
This story makes me say, oh my God, shoes.

02:06:24.620 --> 02:06:27.900
Um, well, they are definitely shoes.

02:06:28.780 --> 02:06:29.260
Oh my God.

02:06:30.780 --> 02:06:32.700
These shoes are 300 fucking dollars.

02:06:32.700 --> 02:06:33.660
They probably are.

02:06:34.780 --> 02:06:39.580
Well, funny enough, I was actually, when I was, I was playing midnight suns last night

02:06:39.580 --> 02:06:42.300
and I just went right into shoes and I had no idea why.

02:06:44.060 --> 02:06:44.560
Anyway.

02:06:45.020 --> 02:06:50.940
Um, Red Wing, the company that makes, you know, boots, work boots and other boots and

02:06:50.940 --> 02:06:54.460
everything did, um, Mario's boots.

02:06:55.820 --> 02:06:59.580
Um, they are not for sale for the record.

02:06:59.580 --> 02:07:00.700
They are not 500.

02:07:00.700 --> 02:07:02.380
They're not 300 fucking dollars.

02:07:03.340 --> 02:07:12.860
Um, but at any rate, um, the, uh, the company has on their website, a video for showing

02:07:12.860 --> 02:07:19.900
how they transformed Mario's, uh, footwear into real world boots.

02:07:19.900 --> 02:07:22.700
It has serene music and you witness the design.

02:07:22.700 --> 02:07:23.020
It does.

02:07:23.020 --> 02:07:25.180
Some of it may have just slipped through on the stream a little bit.

02:07:25.180 --> 02:07:26.140
Sorry about that.

02:07:26.140 --> 02:07:27.260
Let's get to the good stuff.

02:07:27.260 --> 02:07:28.060
Show the shoes.

02:07:28.060 --> 02:07:28.620
There we go.

02:07:29.580 --> 02:07:33.420
Um, but at any rate, um, it's not the first time this has been done.

02:07:33.420 --> 02:07:41.980
Um, uh, uh, Brooklyn, uh, art collective, MSCHF like mischief, uh, did a pair of, uh,

02:07:41.980 --> 02:07:43.500
ballooning red boots.

02:07:43.500 --> 02:07:45.900
Um, like were shown on Astro Boy.

02:07:46.780 --> 02:07:52.460
And, uh, they were, they were purchased actually for $350.

02:07:52.700 --> 02:07:53.580
Not bad.

02:07:53.580 --> 02:07:58.460
And were worn by Lil Wayne, Lil Nas X, Coily Ray and Rich the Kid.

02:07:59.180 --> 02:08:05.420
But I think that these Mario ones are not going to see the light of day as far as anything

02:08:05.420 --> 02:08:06.380
the public can acquire.

02:08:07.340 --> 02:08:10.140
But they kind of look comfortable.

02:08:10.780 --> 02:08:15.180
Um, apparently, uh, DGRMS, I thought I saw this on Twitter and I'm loving the caption

02:08:15.180 --> 02:08:18.300
on this, by the way, it says dramatic music and workshop sounds, uh, they're the whole

02:08:18.300 --> 02:08:18.780
thing.

02:08:18.780 --> 02:08:22.460
But DGRMS says, uh, the shoes are on display at Nintendo New York.

02:08:22.460 --> 02:08:25.980
And I remember seeing some stuff on social media about they had a whole fanfare to unveil

02:08:25.980 --> 02:08:30.060
some shoes that were just shoes that you can't buy.

02:08:30.940 --> 02:08:31.980
Boots are not for sale.

02:08:32.860 --> 02:08:33.580
Rob.

02:08:33.580 --> 02:08:33.820
What?

02:08:34.380 --> 02:08:35.660
Let's see some shirts.

02:08:37.100 --> 02:08:37.500
Let's get them.

02:08:37.500 --> 02:08:40.780
I've already been to New York and after five minutes, I was like, let's go.

02:08:43.660 --> 02:08:44.140
All right.

02:08:44.860 --> 02:08:49.260
Uh, moving on, uh, Loki with some, uh, not great news this week.

02:08:49.260 --> 02:08:49.740
Yeah.

02:08:49.740 --> 02:08:56.060
Unfortunately, um, we had the news that Lance Reddick had passed away and, you know, he

02:08:56.060 --> 02:09:03.180
was 60 years old, a Hollywood actor who had played in many, um, big properties.

02:09:03.180 --> 02:09:08.060
You know, The Wire, John Wick also had a significant role in Destiny 2.

02:09:08.940 --> 02:09:13.740
Um, yeah, unfortunately he, he passed away this week.

02:09:14.060 --> 02:09:19.580
And of course, along with that, you know, there was, um, tributes that were done by

02:09:19.580 --> 02:09:25.100
Destiny players, uh, to, um, the fallen commander.

02:09:25.100 --> 02:09:28.460
And I mean, it's, it's pretty cool to see.

02:09:28.460 --> 02:09:35.260
And of course, you know, um, you know, lots of, uh, heartfelt responses from different

02:09:35.260 --> 02:09:41.020
people and, you know, talking about him and everything far too young, I feel.

02:09:41.420 --> 02:09:45.100
Yeah, um, 60, still really young, uh, all things considered.

02:09:45.100 --> 02:09:49.980
And yeah, um, as I mentioned in chat there, uh, D'Artouzia says, I admit, I didn't know

02:09:49.980 --> 02:09:52.540
he had a few video game roles, but still sad stuff.

02:09:52.540 --> 02:09:53.020
Yeah.

02:09:53.020 --> 02:09:57.500
And I think, um, as far as recent stuff goes, if I remember right, he was the, uh, guy that

02:09:57.500 --> 02:10:01.340
played Wesker in the new Resident Evil series that was on Netflix.

02:10:01.340 --> 02:10:06.300
Granted, wasn't, wasn't really well received and didn't get renewed because it's a Netflix

02:10:06.300 --> 02:10:09.980
show, but he still, you know, definitely made an impression as, you know, a different

02:10:10.940 --> 02:10:15.660
take on Wesker, uh, than maybe what people were used to, uh, from, uh, what's his names,

02:10:15.660 --> 02:10:17.100
you know, vocal performances.

02:10:17.100 --> 02:10:22.620
So, um, yeah, uh, SJ100Matt says he was so talented and such a good guy.

02:10:22.620 --> 02:10:26.540
I followed him on Twitter and he always posted about his dogs and playing games.

02:10:26.540 --> 02:10:28.940
Uh, Meech says he was in the new John Wick.

02:10:28.940 --> 02:10:31.580
Sorry, if you mentioned it, I'm gaming some kind of zoning out.

02:10:31.580 --> 02:10:35.340
No, I mean, definitely a lot of his media appearances he was definitely known for.

02:10:35.340 --> 02:10:36.940
Um, so, um,

02:10:37.020 --> 02:10:39.820
just remember him from the Eric Andre show.

02:10:40.620 --> 02:10:41.120
Yeah.

02:10:42.060 --> 02:10:43.580
This bit was great in that.

02:10:43.580 --> 02:10:46.060
Oh, Shane pointing out another, uh, game that he was involved in.

02:10:46.060 --> 02:10:47.100
I forgot about his role here.

02:10:47.100 --> 02:10:49.420
He says, I'll always remember him from Fringe.

02:10:49.420 --> 02:10:50.860
So there's a lot of, you know, folks.

02:10:50.860 --> 02:10:52.060
Oh yes, for sure.

02:10:52.060 --> 02:10:52.380
Yeah.

02:10:52.380 --> 02:10:52.860
Fringe.

02:10:52.860 --> 02:10:53.340
Awesome.

02:10:53.340 --> 02:10:56.140
And saying, and the highly underrated Quantum Break.

02:10:56.700 --> 02:11:00.460
Yeah, that game was, you know, did fall off the radar of a lot of people, but that was

02:11:00.460 --> 02:11:02.540
a really impressive early Xbox One game.

02:11:02.540 --> 02:11:06.540
So yeah, uh, Questbuster points out his character in Horizon Zero Dawn.

02:11:07.020 --> 02:11:09.100
He's played a lot more than just the one in Destiny.

02:11:09.100 --> 02:11:11.420
It's just that Destiny is the one that everybody's connected.

02:11:11.420 --> 02:11:15.740
So, you know, you're able to kind of do those, uh, tributes, you know, when people pass away.

02:11:15.740 --> 02:11:21.900
Hey, Bob, I knew you were talking about age and something, I actually looked this up for

02:11:21.900 --> 02:11:26.060
a minute and you know that middle age is now considered 55 to 65.

02:11:27.500 --> 02:11:28.060
Oh, wow.

02:11:29.100 --> 02:11:29.900
That's good.

02:11:29.900 --> 02:11:30.300
That's good.

02:11:30.300 --> 02:11:31.340
I'm still not middle aged.

02:11:31.340 --> 02:11:31.580
Good.

02:11:33.020 --> 02:11:33.660
Me either.

02:11:35.100 --> 02:11:35.980
All right.

02:11:35.980 --> 02:11:41.500
Well, otherwise I still want to, you know, turn into, you know, Stalker Channing as the

02:11:41.500 --> 02:11:46.780
ant, you know, in practical magic and just be cool and wake, wake people up for midnight

02:11:46.780 --> 02:11:47.500
margaritas.

02:11:48.700 --> 02:11:49.340
That would be me.

02:11:49.980 --> 02:11:52.860
TigerClownChat says, I thought middle age was when you reached the 40s.

02:11:52.860 --> 02:11:53.420
Not anymore.

02:11:54.140 --> 02:11:57.180
Haven't you heard that old saying 40 is the new 20?

02:11:57.180 --> 02:11:57.900
Wasn't what they say.

02:11:57.900 --> 02:11:58.540
I don't know.

02:11:58.540 --> 02:12:05.820
But anyway, they also say, like, I think that what is actually like back in, uh,

02:12:06.220 --> 02:12:13.180
the 1920s old was 55 and now like new old is like 65.

02:12:13.180 --> 02:12:19.180
I, yeah, I think that's absolutely what you're referring to is just because of science and

02:12:19.180 --> 02:12:21.260
treatment of diseases and prevention.

02:12:21.980 --> 02:12:27.180
People are able and less, you know, um, wars and so forth.

02:12:27.180 --> 02:12:30.540
Not to say there isn't any, but less, uh, on a global scale.

02:12:30.540 --> 02:12:33.900
Anyway, uh, the, the life expectancy is getting longer.

02:12:34.300 --> 02:12:39.900
But anyway, apparently what, what defines the old age is when you hit, uh, the age that

02:12:39.900 --> 02:12:42.220
is the common for, I think, 4% mortality.

02:12:43.660 --> 02:12:45.580
Anyway, there's your science lesson.

02:12:46.700 --> 02:12:50.940
Lance Riddick though, uh, by these standards was still middle age and far too young.

02:12:50.940 --> 02:12:53.340
So, uh, a great loss for the industry.

02:12:54.140 --> 02:12:54.700
All right.

02:12:54.700 --> 02:12:59.420
Last story tonight, and this is usually the in, in memoriam stories would be the last

02:12:59.420 --> 02:13:03.500
story, but I I'm purposely burying this one at the end of the show because I'm sick and

02:13:03.500 --> 02:13:07.180
tired of talking about Call of Duty to be quite honest.

02:13:07.820 --> 02:13:09.580
Call of Duty, more like it.

02:13:09.580 --> 02:13:16.380
But we have, it is a big title in the industry and it has been dominating what's going on

02:13:16.380 --> 02:13:20.220
with the Activision Blizzard acquisition and all that.

02:13:20.220 --> 02:13:26.620
So what happened this week in the ongoing saga of Microsoft trying to get the regulators

02:13:26.620 --> 02:13:28.780
to allow them to buy Activision Blizzard?

02:13:28.780 --> 02:13:33.100
Microsoft signed another 10 year Call of Duty agreement.

02:13:33.660 --> 02:13:35.900
Dark Soccer, this one may be interesting to you.

02:13:35.900 --> 02:13:39.980
I know you're not a big Call of Duty player, but the agreement they signed was with an

02:13:39.980 --> 02:13:43.500
international cloud gaming service called Boosteroid.

02:13:44.620 --> 02:13:45.900
Oh, Boosteroid.

02:13:45.900 --> 02:13:46.140
Yeah.

02:13:46.940 --> 02:13:47.500
And the company-

02:13:49.500 --> 02:13:52.460
I was, I really wanted to like Boosteroid.

02:13:52.460 --> 02:13:59.820
I really, really wanted to, but the connection was so bad.

02:13:59.820 --> 02:14:00.060
Yeah.

02:14:00.060 --> 02:14:02.220
And it sounds like they're mainly overseas too.

02:14:02.380 --> 02:14:06.060
Their development team is Ukraine based.

02:14:06.060 --> 02:14:07.820
The software development team is Ukraine based.

02:14:07.820 --> 02:14:11.020
So yeah, they're probably, it's probably a different experience in the UK than what

02:14:11.020 --> 02:14:11.660
you had here.

02:14:12.380 --> 02:14:16.700
But Boosteroid is the service that's going to be getting Call of Duty in a 10 year agreement

02:14:16.700 --> 02:14:17.340
here.

02:14:17.340 --> 02:14:24.140
So Microsoft is trying to sign these agreements to try to get the deal to close so that it

02:14:24.140 --> 02:14:28.700
does, and also continue to make Sony look like they're getting an offer that they are

02:14:28.700 --> 02:14:30.300
just refusing basically.

02:14:30.300 --> 02:14:31.660
So interesting.

02:14:32.460 --> 02:14:41.340
And kind of related, and this is very important, bignews.com, Disney Dreamlight Valley is finally

02:14:41.340 --> 02:14:42.460
available on GeForce.

02:14:43.340 --> 02:14:46.860
Oh, I didn't know it was not on there originally.

02:14:46.860 --> 02:14:47.260
Interesting.

02:14:47.260 --> 02:14:48.220
It wasn't for a little bit.

02:14:48.220 --> 02:14:51.580
It just popped up on my available list and I already own it.

02:14:52.940 --> 02:14:53.260
All right.

02:14:54.220 --> 02:14:54.860
All right.

02:14:54.860 --> 02:14:58.940
Well, that was all of the news we officially had slated for tonight, but I am going to

02:14:58.940 --> 02:15:00.620
open things up for the listener round table.

02:15:00.620 --> 02:15:04.540
If we have anyone that wants to call in, go for it over at vognetwork.com slash discord,

02:15:04.540 --> 02:15:05.500
you join the green room.

02:15:06.140 --> 02:15:09.420
Also, if you have any just general questions, maybe you're just feeling shy, you don't really

02:15:09.420 --> 02:15:10.460
want to call, that's fine.

02:15:10.460 --> 02:15:11.820
You can ask your questions in chat.

02:15:12.460 --> 02:15:14.140
I always do a mailbag check.

02:15:14.140 --> 02:15:16.620
I don't think I saw anything, but I will check in.

02:15:16.620 --> 02:15:20.220
Participate at orangelaunchradio.com is the place to send emails.

02:15:21.100 --> 02:15:25.980
I'm afraid that the dust bunnies in there have like formed entire warrens and they're

02:15:25.980 --> 02:15:27.900
in competition with cobwebs.

02:15:27.900 --> 02:15:28.540
And spam.

02:15:31.020 --> 02:15:36.300
The, well, this, this, is that why the floor in there is all sticky and squishy?

02:15:36.300 --> 02:15:40.140
There's a little bit of spam that, that lines the floor in there.

02:15:40.140 --> 02:15:40.380
All right.

02:15:41.180 --> 02:15:43.660
But not as bad as the old, uh, email account.

02:15:43.660 --> 02:15:49.020
So, uh, Fanara in chat says, have you shared the D and D Easter egg?

02:15:49.020 --> 02:15:49.980
I, what is that?

02:15:49.980 --> 02:15:50.860
So cool.

02:15:50.860 --> 02:15:51.420
What is this?

02:15:51.420 --> 02:15:52.380
I don't, I actually don't know.

02:15:53.100 --> 02:16:00.140
There is apparently a scene where the group in the movie is walking and across from them

02:16:00.140 --> 02:16:03.260
is the cartoon D and D party.

02:16:04.140 --> 02:16:05.020
Oh, that's funny.

02:16:06.140 --> 02:16:06.540
Yeah.

02:16:07.500 --> 02:16:13.500
Um, uh, Gwen sent me the picture and I will, uh, send it, send you the link.

02:16:14.060 --> 02:16:16.780
Did that movie actually come out now or is that next week?

02:16:16.780 --> 02:16:18.700
It's next week, I think.

02:16:18.700 --> 02:16:21.260
Who wants to go see it with me at the end of the month?

02:16:21.260 --> 02:16:22.380
Maybe I want to go.

02:16:22.380 --> 02:16:26.300
They re-released it back into theaters, I think just this week, but everything everywhere

02:16:26.300 --> 02:16:27.500
all at once is in theaters again.

02:16:27.500 --> 02:16:30.380
I kind of want to see it, but, um, I didn't get to see it.

02:16:30.380 --> 02:16:32.460
I didn't get to do it this weekend, so it'd have to be during the week.

02:16:33.100 --> 02:16:36.380
But one of the places it's playing is the Roseville Galleria.

02:16:36.380 --> 02:16:40.220
And so you can go upstairs to watch the movie and then downstairs to go to round one.

02:16:40.220 --> 02:16:42.060
So just food for thought.

02:16:42.060 --> 02:16:45.180
I sent you the, um, the picture, but you know what?

02:16:45.180 --> 02:16:48.540
I'll go ahead and post, uh, the link in chat that Gwen gave me.

02:16:49.340 --> 02:16:51.180
So there you go.

02:16:51.180 --> 02:16:53.820
Now all of our friends can, can see it too.

02:16:54.380 --> 02:16:59.500
Uh, Shane in chat says, I know nothing about D&D, but I want to see it for some reason.

02:16:59.500 --> 02:17:02.140
Um, the previews look good.

02:17:02.700 --> 02:17:05.420
Uh, and yeah, StarSakura, uh, boop the link there in chat.

02:17:05.420 --> 02:17:08.620
I'm not going to show the picture on stream just because some people are very hypersensitive

02:17:08.620 --> 02:17:09.420
about spoilers.

02:17:09.420 --> 02:17:11.020
So I'm just gonna, you know, leave it at that.

02:17:11.020 --> 02:17:13.900
You, you, you can click the link if you like, but I won't show it on stream for now.

02:17:13.900 --> 02:17:15.260
We haven't already just told you.

02:17:15.260 --> 02:17:16.140
Yeah, right.

02:17:16.140 --> 02:17:21.180
Uh, as Joe 100 Matt says, speaking of emptying your wallet, have you seen the Tron Light

02:17:21.180 --> 02:17:23.740
Cycle Run merch that they're going to have at Disney World?

02:17:23.740 --> 02:17:27.020
Oh, is this the whole like custom figures?

02:17:27.020 --> 02:17:28.140
Yes.

02:17:28.140 --> 02:17:29.340
Give it to us.

02:17:29.340 --> 02:17:30.860
We went into Disneyland.

02:17:30.860 --> 02:17:33.580
It looks so, yeah, it does look so good.

02:17:33.580 --> 02:17:37.580
Like you can make your own, cause of course the lightsabers work so well.

02:17:37.580 --> 02:17:37.980
Yeah.

02:17:37.980 --> 02:17:44.220
I, when, when am I going to be able to afford to go to Disney World?

02:17:45.260 --> 02:17:48.700
We need like this whole underground complex and call it the grid.

02:17:48.700 --> 02:17:51.180
Here's, here's the sad thing about this whole thing.

02:17:52.460 --> 02:17:56.620
I'm gonna go on the Star Trek cruise out of Port Canaveral.

02:17:57.180 --> 02:18:00.140
That's, you fly into Orlando to go to Port Canaveral.

02:18:00.140 --> 02:18:03.180
Technically they have their own airport, but everybody says it's quicker if you just fly

02:18:03.180 --> 02:18:04.380
into Orlando.

02:18:04.380 --> 02:18:07.500
So we're gonna be in Florida in Orlando.

02:18:08.380 --> 02:18:11.180
But like, and Bobby's even saying, go next February.

02:18:11.180 --> 02:18:15.980
Here's the thing, but thinking it through, that means we would do, cause we wouldn't

02:18:15.980 --> 02:18:17.660
just be able to do one day at Disney World.

02:18:17.660 --> 02:18:19.020
We'd have to do like two or three.

02:18:19.580 --> 02:18:25.580
So we do like three days at Disney World and then a seven day cruise or vice versa, a seven

02:18:25.580 --> 02:18:27.740
day cruise and then three days at Disney World.

02:18:28.940 --> 02:18:30.140
I don't know if I could handle it.

02:18:30.780 --> 02:18:31.820
I want that jacket.

02:18:33.020 --> 02:18:34.300
Bobby says, I've done it.

02:18:34.300 --> 02:18:34.800
Dang.

02:18:36.540 --> 02:18:37.040
All right.

02:18:37.740 --> 02:18:40.620
So three days in the park and then relax on the cruise.

02:18:40.620 --> 02:18:41.020
Maybe.

02:18:41.020 --> 02:18:41.420
I don't know.

02:18:41.420 --> 02:18:43.260
I gotta, I gotta think it through.

02:18:43.260 --> 02:18:44.460
Like, I'm not gonna lie.

02:18:44.460 --> 02:18:45.580
I'm fucking tempted.

02:18:45.580 --> 02:18:51.260
And the fact that I have already paid for the cruise does mean that financially it might

02:18:51.260 --> 02:18:52.700
be figureoutable.

02:18:52.700 --> 02:18:55.340
I mean, technically we could always, Alan is coming to Dragon Con.

02:18:55.340 --> 02:18:58.060
We can always go the week after Dragon Con, but then I'm going to be real tired after

02:18:58.060 --> 02:18:58.620
Dragon Con.

02:18:58.620 --> 02:19:05.820
So yeah, it's going to be, it's going to be, uh, it's going to be, I want to do it.

02:19:05.820 --> 02:19:06.540
We'll just see.

02:19:06.540 --> 02:19:08.460
Cause remember, Alan has to buy into this too.

02:19:09.020 --> 02:19:12.700
And being separated from the cats for so long is, is rough.

02:19:12.700 --> 02:19:15.660
But the cat sitting situation worked out this last time.

02:19:15.660 --> 02:19:21.500
So, you know, it gives them a lot of, uh, uh, support in that department, I think.

02:19:21.500 --> 02:19:23.900
But yeah, I really want to ride the Tron light cycle run.

02:19:23.900 --> 02:19:25.260
I just don't know when I'll get out there.

02:19:27.340 --> 02:19:27.840
We'll see.

02:19:29.660 --> 02:19:35.420
Um, you know, honestly I've been getting enough reward points where I could probably book

02:19:35.420 --> 02:19:37.340
a trip on reward points and make it happen.

02:19:37.340 --> 02:19:39.580
I just have to figure out a time that works with my work schedule.

02:19:40.620 --> 02:19:41.260
So we'll see.

02:19:41.900 --> 02:19:44.300
You could come to Disneyland with me for my birthday.

02:19:46.540 --> 02:19:52.140
You're unfortunately, I have an executive level presentation at work the week after

02:19:52.140 --> 02:19:52.700
your birthday.

02:19:53.500 --> 02:19:53.980
It's okay.

02:19:54.620 --> 02:19:55.260
I'm sorry.

02:19:56.380 --> 02:19:59.500
But that just means you have to go to Disneyland a second time and then we can go.

02:20:01.820 --> 02:20:07.660
Well, um, I'll tell you what, I love when my friends meet me for Disneyland, but I also

02:20:07.660 --> 02:20:13.020
do not mind going by myself at all because then I do the whole thing at my own pace.

02:20:13.020 --> 02:20:13.520
Yeah.

02:20:14.860 --> 02:20:15.660
I want to go.

02:20:15.660 --> 02:20:17.740
I actually want to go to Disney world by myself.

02:20:19.020 --> 02:20:21.260
Cause then you don't have to worry about anyone else.

02:20:21.260 --> 02:20:22.620
Yeah, exactly.

02:20:22.620 --> 02:20:23.260
Exactly.

02:20:23.260 --> 02:20:28.460
And I'm like, I, I, I, people give me shit about it, but I don't like to be behind people

02:20:28.460 --> 02:20:29.820
who are taller than me.

02:20:29.820 --> 02:20:31.740
It just makes me feel nervous.

02:20:31.740 --> 02:20:36.220
So I, I go into convention mode and weave through people and move around cause I like

02:20:36.220 --> 02:20:37.580
to be able to see what's in front of me.

02:20:38.140 --> 02:20:42.700
And like there, there's a lot of stuff that I would want to do and seriously do it by

02:20:42.700 --> 02:20:45.500
myself so I can just do things the way I want to do them.

02:20:45.500 --> 02:20:46.000
Yeah.

02:20:46.860 --> 02:20:49.020
However, I've done Disneyland so many times it don't matter.

02:20:50.620 --> 02:20:51.020
All right.

02:20:51.020 --> 02:20:54.620
Um, I wanted to check in if there were any last minute stories while we wait to see if

02:20:54.620 --> 02:20:56.700
there's any other comments that come in.

02:20:56.700 --> 02:20:58.140
Um, but I'll check on last minute stories here.

02:20:58.700 --> 02:20:58.940
Yeah.

02:20:58.940 --> 02:21:05.820
There was a leak of a new Lego racing game that's coming out called Lego two K drive

02:21:05.820 --> 02:21:10.700
and it was leaked by, um, having some screenshots of it being a show.

02:21:10.700 --> 02:21:17.580
And I guess they're doing some sort of beta tests on the, like a PVP racing part of it,

02:21:17.580 --> 02:21:23.020
but it looks sort of like a kind of set up like a Mario Kart type game.

02:21:23.660 --> 02:21:28.780
And they've got different levels that are, I don't know if they're not really based off

02:21:28.780 --> 02:21:29.500
of Lego sets.

02:21:29.500 --> 02:21:30.940
It's just kind of different themes.

02:21:30.940 --> 02:21:36.620
So you have like this runway roundabout that kind of has airplanes in it, rapid falls,

02:21:36.620 --> 02:21:43.260
which kind of looks like a mountain, uh, swamp us, which is, you know, swamp, uh, cat, cat

02:21:43.260 --> 02:21:47.420
scratch freeway, which has, it looks like a, like a cat tree in there.

02:21:47.420 --> 02:21:49.020
And then it's like a race course.

02:21:49.020 --> 02:21:54.940
I don't know if it has like a cat, like they did the new Jago movies, um, down on the farm,

02:21:54.940 --> 02:21:58.780
which, you know, obviously it looks like a farm type thing, glazed overdrive.

02:21:58.780 --> 02:22:06.540
It's got donuts and candy stuff everywhere and headless horsepower and chasm crossing.

02:22:06.540 --> 02:22:07.500
So it looks pretty cool.

02:22:08.780 --> 02:22:09.980
I'll play it when it comes out.

02:22:09.980 --> 02:22:11.580
I like Mario Kart and I like Lego.

02:22:11.580 --> 02:22:12.220
So of course.

02:22:13.820 --> 02:22:14.220
All right.

02:22:14.940 --> 02:22:18.780
Well with that, I believe we've reached the end of our show for tonight, but I want to

02:22:18.780 --> 02:22:22.860
thank everybody for listening once again to Orange Lawns Radio, whether it was on the

02:22:22.860 --> 02:22:27.900
podcast feed or live here at twitch.tv slash vog network on Sunday nights, we appreciate

02:22:27.900 --> 02:22:31.740
you being a part of the experience and being a part of our family here on Sunday.

02:22:31.740 --> 02:22:33.100
Thank you so much for being here.

02:22:33.100 --> 02:22:36.140
And if you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Lawns Radio, tell a friend or two about

02:22:36.140 --> 02:22:39.260
the show, help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice,

02:22:39.260 --> 02:22:44.220
but we need more voices here to put out on air and a nice five star review on a site

02:22:44.220 --> 02:22:48.620
like iTunes, Spotify, wherever it is, you found this podcast, those go an awful long

02:22:48.620 --> 02:22:50.620
way, uh, you know, come join us.

02:22:50.620 --> 02:22:55.900
We're on the road to a thousand weekly episodes, uh, coming up in, uh, next year.

02:22:55.900 --> 02:22:58.140
So it's gonna be, gonna be something.

02:22:58.140 --> 02:23:03.180
So, um, that right around the time that I may or may not go to Disney world and, uh,

02:23:03.180 --> 02:23:04.700
the Star Trek cruise we'll see.

02:23:04.700 --> 02:23:06.700
So, uh, but that is coming up.

02:23:06.700 --> 02:23:13.180
So join us as we count the road to a thousand weekly episodes, 48 more to go after tonight.

02:23:13.180 --> 02:23:13.680
All right.

02:23:14.380 --> 02:23:17.500
With that, let's wrap it all up for tonight.

02:23:17.500 --> 02:23:21.100
Dark Sakura, um, I know you're doing some streaming after the show tonight.

02:23:21.100 --> 02:23:22.140
I hope you have some fun.

02:23:22.700 --> 02:23:25.980
Sorry, I'm assuming you're swiffing tonight and, uh, yeetin.

02:23:27.180 --> 02:23:32.380
Um, actually two of the team yeet may be showing up a little bit later.

02:23:32.380 --> 02:23:37.020
Um, but if Gwen's down to play, I'm down to have Gwen in.

02:23:37.580 --> 02:23:40.300
Might, might, might, might, one of my favorite people to play with.

02:23:41.020 --> 02:23:45.580
And, uh, other than that, I'm gonna be an annoying killer.

02:23:46.460 --> 02:23:47.100
Sounds good.

02:23:47.100 --> 02:23:51.500
And if Gwen does play, I'm, I'm casting a protective bubble around Gwen because those

02:23:51.500 --> 02:23:54.060
killers always pick on her and I hate to see it.

02:23:54.060 --> 02:23:55.260
So I'm cast, I'm doing it.

02:23:55.260 --> 02:23:59.500
I'm casting a protective bubble around Gwen so that she's not tunneled by killers tonight.

02:23:59.500 --> 02:24:00.000
All right.

02:24:00.700 --> 02:24:01.980
Have a good stream.

02:24:01.980 --> 02:24:02.380
Bye.

02:24:02.380 --> 02:24:04.460
I have, have fun storming the castle.

02:24:04.460 --> 02:24:05.260
Will do.

02:24:05.260 --> 02:24:05.900
I think it'll work.

02:24:06.540 --> 02:24:07.740
It'll take a miracle.

02:24:07.740 --> 02:24:08.380
Bye.

02:24:08.380 --> 02:24:08.880
Bye.

02:24:09.500 --> 02:24:10.140
All right.

02:24:10.140 --> 02:24:12.300
Uh, Loki, your final thought for tonight?

02:24:12.300 --> 02:24:19.660
My final thought is I, I pasted a link in chat for the Resident Evil 4 anime that is

02:24:19.660 --> 02:24:23.900
apparently part of their marketing plan for the Resident Evil 4 game.

02:24:23.900 --> 02:24:25.660
It's done by Nippon Animation.

02:24:25.660 --> 02:24:26.620
It's ridiculous.

02:24:28.540 --> 02:24:29.040
All right.

02:24:30.140 --> 02:24:34.780
Uh, my final thought, I'm gonna probably go play some more Diablo 4 and get the most I

02:24:34.780 --> 02:24:38.380
can out of this beta, see if I can get all the way to 25 during the beta.

02:24:38.380 --> 02:24:40.300
Uh, but that's, that's it.

02:24:40.300 --> 02:24:43.660
I'm having a great time and I can't wait to, uh, level another character next weekend.

02:24:43.660 --> 02:24:47.100
So, um, and I'll be doing some streaming hopefully too.

02:24:47.180 --> 02:24:50.060
Hopefully now that the network issues have stabilized a little bit, cause that's, I didn't

02:24:50.060 --> 02:24:53.420
stream on Friday cause it took like an hour and a half to get in and even then you would

02:24:53.420 --> 02:24:57.900
get disconnected sometimes, but it seems like they worked a lot of that out for Saturday,

02:24:57.900 --> 02:24:58.300
Sunday.

02:24:58.300 --> 02:25:00.940
So hooray, the beta is working as intended.

02:25:00.940 --> 02:25:01.980
So that's good.

02:25:01.980 --> 02:25:04.940
So hopefully next week it'll be a little more stable and I can do some streaming, but a

02:25:04.940 --> 02:25:08.780
lot of people have been streaming it honestly, if you, uh, uh, want to check that out.

02:25:08.780 --> 02:25:11.580
So that's good to do it for another episode of Orange Launch Radio.

02:25:11.580 --> 02:25:13.420
Thank you all so much for being here.

02:25:13.420 --> 02:25:14.380
Appreciate you all.

02:25:14.380 --> 02:25:16.860
