0	13760	Video gaming merchandise has been an ever-growing thing, but thus far you haven't often seen
13760	16680	a game's name in a grocery or other common personal goods store.
16680	21280	But now, a 1980s stalwart and a 2010s breakout are both landing on more shelves.
21280	24680	One of them is part of a balanced breakfast, and the other keeps you fresh, clean, and
24680	25680	smooth.
25680	27280	Guess which games, and guess which products.
27280	30040	We're the ThinkGeek, and you're not going to see these on GameStop shelves.
30040	32960	Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you which
32960	36000	of these and about the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now on the show
36000	39800	where every gamer has a voice.
39800	44280	Hello my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show
44280	46600	where every gamer has a voice.
46600	55040	It is Orange Lounge Radio, and we are live here once again with episode number 953 of
55040	59000	our show for tonight, March the 26th of 2023.
59000	64120	My name is Rob Roberts, and I am joined week, after week, after week, after week, after
64120	66060	week by my co-hosts.
66060	68240	Say hello to Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.
68240	69240	What's up?
69240	70800	Hi, how are you doing?
70800	72160	I'm all right.
72160	76080	Did you hear, by the way, have you heard the latest news about my husband?
76080	79080	Something about a ban?
79080	82280	Yes, he's in Twitch jail right now.
82280	83280	Why?
83320	88880	Okay, so he loves to stream games with mods, right?
88880	96200	So he was running a mod for Final Fantasy 7 Remake that was showing Cloud running around
96200	97700	in a jockstrap.
97700	103440	So his little booty was hanging out, and somebody decided that those assets were too hot for
103440	107640	TV, and so he was delivered with a three-day ban in the middle of the stream with four
107640	112080	viewers watching, which, here's the thing.
112080	114680	Diablo 4 is like all the rage right now.
114680	118960	Don't get me wrong, I love Diablo 4, but half of Twitch is streaming that limited access
118960	120420	beta right now, right?
120420	126220	And all of that death, dismemberment, violence, destruction, decapitation, you name it, all
126220	127880	going on in that game.
127880	133920	But, pun intended, Allen decides to show a risque mod, and he gets banned.
133920	138540	Now look, I'm not complaining about what Twitch is doing, because Allen knew he was toeing
138540	139540	the line.
139940	143500	He knew it was a little risky what he was doing, so he's a big boy and can take the
143500	144740	big boy punishment.
144740	148340	But I am pointing out, there's a double standard here going on, folks.
148340	149340	And I-
149340	151340	How many years have I been saying that?
151340	152820	Oh, forever.
152820	159720	And how much do you want to bet if that mod had been a lady, it would not have been quick
159720	161060	to have been reported?
161060	162060	And that's just-
162060	163060	No, it probably would have been-
163060	164060	Facts are facts.
164060	165060	Our bodies are policed a lot more.
165580	169700	It would have been like, you know, that needs to go in the hot tub streaming section.
169700	174060	I mean, this is in the wrong section, just letting you know.
174060	175060	So-
175060	181280	Our bodies are policed more and sexualized more, so I'd be surprised if it went on longer.
181280	187100	So it's just, I don't know, I can't help but think maybe even somebody we know or somebody
187100	191040	had actually reported that, but I like to believe that the universe has a nice little
191040	193340	way of dealing with those types of people.
193340	194480	So I will just kind of, you know-
194480	195480	It's an auto-detect algorithm.
195480	196480	What's that?
196480	200120	Or it could have been an auto-detect.
200120	202280	It wasn't his first time running that mod.
202280	203280	It was a few streams in.
203280	207160	So, I mean, and again, I'm not mad about, and neither is he, about what happened.
207160	209860	It's just one of those things where it's like, it's just a ridiculous double standard in
209860	215640	our society that the violence, you know, and even when it comes to Twitch or whatever it
215640	223600	is, an R-rated movie or what have you allows a certain amount of risqueness to it that
223600	226400	for whatever reason Twitch does not mirror.
226400	229920	And that's, you know, again, that's okay, but I just, it's a bit of a double standard.
229920	234540	I think the violence should be policed just as much if we're going to do that, so.
234540	237920	That's pretty much been the cry of women everywhere.
237920	242880	I mean, having our bodies policed when violence is certainly allowed everywhere.
242880	243880	Yeah.
243880	244880	I agree.
245120	247120	Anyway, also say hello.
247120	248120	Sorry.
248120	249400	I know you heard his voice in there too, but I also want to-
249400	253640	That has nothing to do with body positivity, I'm just saying.
253640	254640	Whatever happens.
254640	259360	The two should not be, should be remotely combined.
259360	264120	I feel like I might know what angle he's taking with that comment is that like, to me, I read
264120	266720	that comment to be like, it's just a butt.
266720	270800	And that's how, that's like art butts, whatever, like, and that's how I kind of look at it
270800	272800	is that it's just a butt, people.
272800	273800	It's just a butt.
273800	276600	Positively- It's not even a real butt.
276600	279520	Is a different thing than just someone showing their ass.
279520	280520	No.
280520	281520	So.
281520	282520	Anyway, hello, Techmaster Loki.
282520	283520	How are you?
283520	284520	I'm fine.
284520	285520	Yeah.
285520	286520	And how's your week been?
286520	287520	Yeah, it's been all right.
287520	288520	Yeah.
288520	289840	What's that game playing behind you tonight?
289840	290840	Red Dead Redemption 2.
290840	293720	Oh, is that, so I thought it was Red Dead Redemption, but I wasn't positive.
293720	294720	Okay.
294720	295720	Fair enough.
295720	296720	All right.
296720	297720	Let's see.
297720	300700	We do tape live, of course, every Sunday night at nine o'clock Eastern, six o'clock Pacific
300700	306520	at the Voice of Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash vog network, right after the Bobby Blackwolf
306520	307980	show.
307980	312740	And if you are watching along with the show, you can chat along with us.
312740	318020	So I'm sorry, I'm laughing at a comment about something that happened before the podcast.
318020	325660	And yes, the little joke bump that plays at the beginning when we go live, it was a joke
325660	330300	about AI tonight, and I'm getting asked for screenshots about what we actually got the
330300	331500	AI to say.
331500	335940	And yes, I'm happy to send those over later after the show, I'll post them on Discord.
335940	336940	Let's see.
336940	337940	Yeah.
337940	342180	Dark Tetsuya appreciates the joke about assets, yes.
342180	347920	Questbuster talking about the AI joke, a Chinese company actually did appoint an AI as a CEO.
347920	348960	Not joking, really.
348960	350620	I had not heard about that.
350620	356140	I'd be very curious, because this is all the rage now, and we even have a story later on
356140	357140	in the show about it this week.
357140	359500	I'd be very curious to kind of know more about that.
359500	365060	So anyway, for the sake of the podcast listeners, one of the quote unquote jokes I put in there
365060	367220	as I asked, it was Google Bard.
367220	372700	And I asked, I said, do you think Bobby Kotick should be CEO of Activision?
372700	378100	And it actually spit out a response and said, these are all the things that he's done wrong.
378100	383340	And for these reasons, including basically his rampant, all the sexual harassment that
383340	386180	went on Activision Blizzard while he was over, he should be fired.
386180	390860	And I was like, Google Bard, smarter than the board at Activision Blizzard.
390860	394260	I think an actual turd would make a better CEO.
394260	395260	Agree.
395260	396580	Actual AI would make a better CEO.
396580	403760	No, no, I'm saying I can dig a turd out of my cat box and maybe a P clump, and that would
403760	405660	do better than him.
405660	406660	I agree.
406660	408380	All right.
408380	413500	Let's get into our official story at the top here before we get into our gaming weeks.
413500	414500	Let's talk about this.
414500	417700	This is interesting because it kind of has to do with, you know, we've been talking about
417700	422940	Diablo 4 and a lot of games that we play right now in this day and age are always online.
422940	427900	And this used to be something you would get a lot more pushback on, but that kind of seems
427900	429400	to have faded a lot in the last few years.
429400	432180	I kind of wanted to dissect that a little bit, but first let's talk about like what's
432180	433980	happening with the whole back and forth on that.
433980	435960	Loki, I'll turn it over to you.
435960	440940	So basically they had announced that Redfall was going to have a, I think it has a single
440940	445120	player campaign and that it's still always online as well.
445120	449140	So if you wanted to play, you know, single player, then you're stuck being connected
449140	450220	to the internet.
450220	454700	And of course people were not happy with that and let their voices be heard.
454700	461220	And so because of that, the game director Harvey Smith said that, you know, they have,
461220	466420	they've listened to the players and have a lot of empathy for folks who don't have consistent
466420	467420	internet connections.
467420	472060	Because we do take complaints about always online with a lot of empathy, we listen and
472060	475140	we've already started work to address this.
475140	482020	And in the future, we have some things like to encrypt your saves and do a bunch of UI
482020	483020	work to support it.
483020	488140	And we're looking into, I'm not supposed to promise anything, but we're looking into working
488140	493620	actively towards fixing that in the future.
493620	497640	So there, yeah, I don't know.
497640	501020	So why did it require an online connection in the first place?
501020	506780	Well, I guess, you know, in-game purchases, it says always online allowed us to do some
506780	508980	accessibility stuff.
508980	511500	I'm really, my eyes really big there.
511500	514020	It allows us for telemetries.
514020	520140	Like if everybody's fallen off ladders and dying, you know, then we can go tweak the
520140	521140	ladder code.
521140	524820	I mean, I don't know.
524820	528880	I don't think that other games don't necessarily do that.
528880	535860	Like you could have that without being always online because people would report bugs to
535860	537960	you and then you go and fix those bugs.
537960	541080	Like that's kind of what you do with that.
541080	545740	Like you wouldn't, like, are you really going to be looking at all that data?
545740	548100	I doubt it.
548100	551260	A comment from Bobby Blackwolf in our chat saying they've been doing this telemetry stuff
551260	552260	forever though.
552260	553820	It doesn't need to be always online.
553820	556340	They just upload data at other times.
556340	560740	So but Bobby says they do look at that data.
560740	565780	I wonder if it's, you know, I think sometimes we have the impression they don't look at
565780	568620	the data piece by piece and they probably don't look at the data piece by piece.
568620	572220	They look at trends and big, big clumps of data.
572220	577300	Yeah, they would like, they probably would use it to further back up, like say someone's
577300	580460	like saying, hey, you know, going back to the ladder issue.
580460	583540	Yeah, I'm having an issue, you know, being able to climb that ladder.
583540	588500	They can then go look at, you know, that ladder object or whatever and seeing people interact
588500	592960	with it and can get a better idea of like, is this an isolated issue?
592960	595420	Is this something that all the players are experiencing?
595420	600940	Yeah, it helps with further bolster and I guess prioritize errors that they need to
600940	605220	fix or tweaks or rebalances, whatever that type of stuff.
605220	609580	But if that were the case, that all the games are doing that, which they're not, then everything
609580	611020	would be always online.
611020	613460	So I think there's other ways around that.
613460	614460	Yeah.
614460	618260	Comments in chat as Joe and Matt says, it's all about keeping the game from being pirated
618260	619260	as well.
619260	623740	You know, I was just thinking the other day, I don't hear a lot about torrents anymore.
623740	625660	I'm sure I'm not being completely naive.
625660	627540	Yes, I know it's all still out there, folks.
627540	632740	I'm not like completely naive, but I feel like a lot of that isn't as like piracy doesn't
632740	636900	feel as mainstream now as it used to feel.
636900	640940	And I don't know if a lot of that is because of like streaming and the capabilities that
640940	641940	is brought.
641940	646780	Like I, and here's the thing, you know, if you want to take piracy way, way back to like
646780	654580	the late nineties, early aughts when it was, yeah, LimeWire, Napster, what was the other
654580	655580	big one?
655580	659060	But there were all these ways to, you know, the peer to peer file transferring and all
659060	662400	that stuff where we were basically pirating music.
662400	669600	But then what happened to the industry iTunes happened, iTunes happened and it didn't completely
669600	672920	shut that down, but boy, oh boy, did it scale it way back and sure.
672920	676480	There was still torrents of, you know, a CD quality albums and things like that.
676480	678060	And that all is still out there, I'm sure.
678060	683000	But especially not just iTunes, but now that we've taken that and transitioned into Apple
683000	688840	music, Spotify, Pandora, you name it, all these, you know, what's the title, you know,
688840	693660	all these, you know, different music streaming services, it's just not nearly as prevalent
693660	699600	because the option is still there to do these streamings and get that like instant gratification
699600	701360	of like, whatever it is you're looking for.
701360	705560	And a lot of streaming TV services seem to do this now, which is why I feel like there's
705560	707760	less and less of the piracy that's going on.
707760	708760	Yeah.
708760	713780	And I don't think that they have anything for like the Xbox series S or X right now
713780	716400	that there is like even a piracy scene for it.
716400	721580	I mean, at some point, if they, you know, exploit the console in a way that they can
721580	725800	do that, then yeah, that might be a thing like the Xbox 360 is really bad.
725800	729640	But and I, again, I don't, I want to make sure I'm very clear on this.
729640	732360	I'm not naive to the fact that piracy still exists.
732360	734400	Of course it still exists and it's going on out there.
734400	741520	I'm just saying the percentage of average Joes and Janes and, you know, folks out there
741520	745760	that are participating in that seems to be lower.
745760	747760	I mean, that could be a confirmation bias or personal thing.
747760	748760	I don't know.
748760	752920	But I just, I feel like we're not, like even on like Twitter and social media, we don't
752920	757480	see people as brazen about posting that type of stuff anymore that we used to.
757480	765280	I feel like that level of the mainstreamization of piracy in a way is scaled back a little
765280	766400	bit, especially when it comes to games.
766400	768880	It just doesn't seem like it's as big of a threat as it used to be.
768880	769880	Yeah.
769880	774560	I think a lot of like Xbox right now, the closest thing that you have with that is just,
774560	778200	you know, there's stuff being run in the dev mode, but that's more like emulators and
778200	779200	stuff like that.
779200	784000	That's less, you know, I don't think anyone's actually pirating anything with that.
784000	789000	I mean, obviously torrent stuff nowadays, TV shows, movies, that type of stuff for the
789000	794040	most part, software, maybe PC game piracy to a certain extent.
794040	798280	Although I would think that that's probably dropped down even still, although now that
798280	803800	games are going back up to $70, you know, even PC, that might kick back up again.
804200	808240	If the games can run offline, which a lot of them in this day and age don't anymore,
808240	809240	it seems like.
809240	817220	Well, I mean, there's patches for everything, so I wouldn't say that, yeah, like your typical
817220	821600	retail game may not run, you know, always online, but I mean, we've learned things like
821600	822600	remember SimCity?
822600	825760	Oh yeah, it's impossible for that to run.
825760	826760	Good point.
826760	827760	Good point.
827760	828760	Except it wasn't.
828760	829760	Point taken.
830760	834160	It's just interesting to me because I feel like, okay, so I'm also looking at a lot of
834160	837920	things through the lens of this Diablo 4 beta that's going on this weekend, and you know,
837920	843440	there's a limited beta last weekend, and obviously I'm a big Diablo fan, but Diablo 4, as far
843440	847240	as I know, and chat, please correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't see how I am on this
847240	851480	because the queue issues are a big issue to get into the game, but Diablo 4 isn't always
851480	861140	online game, as was Diablo 3, and Diablo 3 got a lot of shit about always being online.
861140	865840	So much so that when the console versions of Diablo 3 came out, they were offline and
865840	866920	it was a selling point.
866920	870920	Now granted, Diablo 3 also had this huge problem.
870920	874300	Remember what Diablo 3 looks like today and what it looked like the day it launched are
874300	877960	very different products because the other thing Diablo 3 had that people did not like
877960	883360	was that real money auction house, hence the reason why it had to always be online.
883360	888880	Now Diablo 4 doesn't have a real money auction house because Activision Blizzard done learned
888880	894560	their lesson from that whole thing, but it does have cosmetics, the battle pass, a lot
894560	899480	of things that games as a service kind of have, although Blizzard swears up and down,
899480	903560	they're not going to tie that to content, so we'll see if they're true to their word
903560	906200	on all of that.
906200	913960	But I guess my point is, I feel like the buzz about Diablo 4 being always online, I'm not
913960	916660	seeing people complain about that.
916660	921760	Have we just gotten to a point here a decade later that we just assume that a lot of games
921760	925280	are going to require an online connection and we don't care as much about that anymore?
925280	926800	That's really the point I'm trying to get to.
926800	931340	Do we as gamers just accept that more games are just, they're always going to be online
931340	934120	because that's the way games are?
934120	937840	They're connected and whether that be because they're really trying to push multiplayer
937840	943360	or it's a game as a service and all the things that come with that, your battle passes, cosmetics,
943360	949760	your shops and all that, although single player games, the very first Ludicrous DLC was for
949760	954920	a single player game and that's Elder Scrolls Oblivion and the horse armor that set the
954920	957540	standard for all cosmetic DLC to follow.
957540	961440	That was a single player game, so you don't have to always have a game online to do that
961440	964200	type of stuff, but I digress.
964200	967580	I'm curious, what do you all think about this?
967580	969640	Do you think we as gamers accept this now?
969640	972080	Let me get some comments from chat.
972080	977240	Questbuster says, I accept that more games are always going to be online, but I don't
977240	978640	have to like it.
978640	979640	Fair enough.
979640	984240	Fifth Dream brings up a point about the annoyingness of games being online sometimes.
984240	991160	That rubber banding, even when you're soloing in, I think Diablo, oh, DIV, D4, why don't
991160	992160	you just put D4?
992160	995160	Why do you put the Roman numerals?
995160	996800	I was like, what's DIV?
996800	998160	Okay, I get it.
998160	999160	I get it.
999160	1000160	I get it.
1000160	1002720	Even when you're soloing in D4 is eh.
1002720	1004560	So yeah, and then the monsters are that.
1004560	1007520	So yeah, there are some annoyances that come with the always online thing too, is that
1007520	1010800	like even when you're solo player, you're going to encounter issues.
1010800	1015480	Now I chalk a lot of these things up to the fact it's a beta and hopefully they iron some
1015480	1017040	of these things out before June.
1017040	1020520	I actually wasn't having a lot of problems with rubber banding though, to be quite honest.
1020520	1025640	I wasn't having, my problems seem to be more graphical in nature for high end stuff and
1025640	1030680	I actually took my graphics down a setting to get it to work, but I noticed they released
1030680	1034120	updated drivers and that might actually fix my issue.
1034120	1035120	I don't know.
1035120	1040640	But I am chalking a lot of this up to just, you know, the lovely parts of a beta.
1040640	1043080	But anyway, let me go back to the question at hand.
1043080	1047760	Do you think that we as gamers have just accepted that more and more games are going to be online?
1048280	1051240	Do any of my co-hosts have a standpoint on this?
1051240	1055840	I mean, if it makes sense, like in the sense of a game, like if it's it's a multiplayer game or
1055840	1059760	something like that, that requires all always online connection.
1059760	1066800	But I think for like a single player game where conceivable, there's no real reason to have that
1066800	1069080	type of connection.
1069080	1072760	It really shouldn't be because we've seen examples where this just fails.
1072760	1077040	Like Assassin's Creed had a lot of those games that were always online.
1077040	1082840	And when their authentication servers go down, well, hey, now you can't play your single player game.
1083400	1087200	You know, like that's really stupid to be designing a game like that.
1087200	1089160	And for what reason were they doing that?
1089160	1090960	Probably monetization.
1090960	1096000	You know, they'll probably make some excuse like, oh, it was telemetry, whatever, you know, like.
1096360	1101840	But in the end, like when those servers go down, then news reports go out about how, oh, hey, look
1101840	1103840	at this unnecessary thing that's going on.
1103880	1110320	Like it really. I don't think it's absolutely necessary to have an always online connection for things.
1110320	1115960	I know in the past it was because like, hey, this is one other way we're going to try to stave off piracy, which never worked.
1115960	1117120	It never did.
1118200	1121200	So. I don't know the reason.
1121200	1125120	Typically, the reason that they want to do that isn't for the benefit of the player.
1125360	1127880	It's for the benefit of the company and to make more money.
1127960	1129560	That's typically why they're doing it.
1129800	1131560	Hashtag blame telemetry.
1131880	1138240	All right. It's not telemetry, it's usually not telemetry, it is monetization.
1138240	1142280	Like it typically is the reason why that they want that always online.
1142280	1149600	So that so that you nasty cheaters out there can't get that item that you're supposed to be paying five dollars for or something like that.
1149600	1152160	Like it's that it's about control.
1153040	1155080	Did you want to elaborate, Jamin, before I go to chat?
1156240	1160080	Well, I mean, I would hope I would have had a turn to say my piece.
1160480	1168240	Of course. But I I'm always against the always online thing, except in the case of multiplayer.
1168240	1180360	I think that if you're trying to check for like a cheat, then there should be like an initial, you know, check for, you know, any bad stuff that shouldn't be there and then let you play the game.
1180680	1187440	I mean. I back in the day, there were other ways to know if the game was pirated.
1187440	1202520	I mean, if if it was like you would get to a point of the game and you couldn't play it because it wasn't official software or it would come up with a message that says, hey, thank you for trying the game by the full version, you know, because they knew about it.
1203000	1204320	You know, it's.
1205720	1207880	It's it's it's unnecessary.
1207880	1212200	We we were fine without it before, you know, I.
1213800	1216240	It's just about control, it's controlling their product.
1216240	1217880	It's it's loss prevention.
1218360	1222120	It's I mean, and yeah, monetization can be a big part of it.
1222120	1232800	But in the end, it's wanting to make sure that that their asset is protected, that they're actually making the money on the asset and not, you know, the copies are not there.
1233960	1245960	And who cares if somebody cheats in single player that used it that that was old gaming was cheating in single player, you know, and we can sit here in our fucking rocking chairs being like, I remember when I used up
1245960	1253680	up, down, down, left, right, to be able to get through the first stage, Gradius and get my Contra lives, except for Jamie, who's saying they're going, I don't need the 30 lives code.
1255080	1257040	Oh, come on. I suck at Gradius.
1258400	1261200	Sorry, I was transitioning into Contra there, but yes.
1261400	1264680	Oh, well, Contra, I don't know anyone.
1265000	1272000	OK, I take that back. Dan's good at Contra, but like I actually do not enjoy playing Contra for the record.
1272760	1279400	I enjoy playing it for a little bit, but I, you know, it's a fun throwback, you know, anyway.
1279720	1282040	I've never actually enjoyed playing a Contra game.
1282320	1288280	We have some really good insight from chat and I want to get some of these comments here because I think this is really interesting.
1289080	1293040	Fixation Gaze in chat says the cool thing about cheating has died.
1293240	1296240	Modding now feels more like how cheat codes used to be.
1296240	1299480	Well, it also kind of feels like that people are selling cheat codes now.
1299720	1310840	You know, why allow you to do up, up, down, down 30 lives when I can sell you a life kit that has extra lives in it, which is what a lot of games do these days, right?
1312200	1315400	I thought this was a really insightful comment, actually.
1315400	1318440	This is just about a gold star level comment to me.
1318440	1319680	This is silver star level.
1320320	1324200	It's from zenmonkey11 who says zoomers accept all that crap.
1324560	1327960	They grew up with consoles that connect to the Internet, so they don't care.
1328280	1332760	I care. That's why I don't buy always online games if I can help it.
1333080	1339840	I actually thought that was very interesting because you even think about that term zoomers and how that generation got that term.
1340200	1352200	And that's because of, you know, the fact that we've got a whole generation of kids who've grown up now with a couple of years in online school and Zoom school and being connected and finding connections for birthday parties.
1352240	1354760	I mean, we all had to go through it with the pandemic lockdowns.
1355120	1358760	But, you know, now especially we have a generation that's grown up on that.
1358760	1361320	So it almost kind of leads to that whole thought of.
1363040	1372120	And again, I'm not trying to make it like an age, I'm not trying to be like I'm not trying to make broad stroke judgments based solely on age.
1372120	1384320	However, you know, is it possible that younger folks, because there's that always online connection in these other ways, have just grown up to accept that there is going to
1384320	1392560	always be a sense of always being connected online because sometimes, as we've unfortunately learned, that may be all the connection there is at some points.
1393400	1395360	I don't know. I thought that was a very interesting perspective.
1397760	1398960	Some other comments in chat.
1399360	1405640	Let's see. Sean322 says, I don't mind always being online as long as someone doesn't pick up the phone and disconnect me.
1405760	1408400	Oh, sorry. Flashback from the AOL dial up days.
1408400	1408920	Yes, yes.
1409880	1415280	SheHulk10 says, if the world is ever changing, then online single player is fun.
1415640	1419320	You know, and when it comes to like Diablo 4, I don't mind it.
1419320	1424560	I like the sense of like the world being alive and seeing other people and all of that stuff.
1424560	1430760	So if there's kind of like a point that makes sense, I don't just hate it on its merits alone.
1431080	1444440	But I also like it's kind of it's one of those weird things where like, as a gamer who plays and consumes a lot of games is like you kind of know when a game needs to be online to enhance it.
1444880	1454560	And when the only reason it's having you online is for telemetry, quote unquote, so I'm using my quoting fingers to represent for the online shop is what I really mean.
1454560	1464640	And I feel like a lot of our bullshit detectors are very strong and we can sense when a game doesn't really need to be online and how that can be very frustrating.
1465200	1476360	So completely, by the way, agree with Fixie in chat in response to what E3vil said, I'm just going to say evil.
1477560	1480040	Kids know how to fucking read a book, OK, dude?
1481040	1504600	Kids, the letters on an e-reader are the same as the letters in a book, it's just a matter of convenience, that makes zero sense to me, I don't get I don't get why why you say that, OK, but how hard is it if I can turn a page, there's they know how to turn a page on a book.
1504840	1516480	There's these there's these clickbaity articles out there that talk about I know where the school of thought comes from, and it's the clickbait social media culture is that there's that clickbaity article about that.
1516880	1522040	The five year old is handed a book and they try to do this to the book and I'm doing a swiping motion with my finger.
1522040	1526280	They try to do this to the book because they don't understand because they've never seen a physical book before.
1526440	1529400	And these are clickbaity articles that are all over Facebook and social media.
1529400	1532840	I see where that is coming from.
1533000	1533520	I do.
1533960	1535520	But it doesn't take.
1535520	1540560	But also, yes, to your point and what Fixie saying, it takes 30 seconds to figure it out.
1540560	1547160	But boy, oh boy, do the parents love to tell the entire neighborhood about that 30 seconds about their kid trying to swipe the book.
1548000	1551120	Like they're bragging about their kid not being able to figure something out.
1552040	1552960	That's what it is.
1553880	1566040	I stopped trying to make kids look stupid or foolish or unable to figure out earlier technology or things like that.
1566040	1566960	It's ridiculous.
1566960	1569280	Kids are smarter than we give them credit for.
1569800	1572400	You know, we were we were all there, too.
1572400	1574840	We were smarter than we were given credit for.
1575320	1580920	Let's just stop spreading this really toxic stereotype.
1580920	1585640	You know, it's it's it's trying to do an us versus them thing.
1585640	1589200	Every generation tries to do it and it should just be us.
1589760	1594120	And we have responsibility to help them and they're going to be the next generation.
1594120	1594800	It's just us.
1595120	1597520	And that has been something.
1597520	1599400	Unfortunately, I don't disagree with Shane at all.
1599680	1603840	But unfortunately, this has been a thing that's been around for generations.
1604200	1607680	You know, I think think back to TV shows from the 70s.
1607680	1609440	Kids say the darndest things.
1609680	1615600	And it's all about the wacky, wild things kids do.
1617120	1626600	I mean, all right, so think back to like 1984 with a Mac in front of you, you know, you didn't know what to do with the computer the first time you saw one.
1626600	1628880	It's like, is this is this a typewriter?
1629480	1635880	Yeah, but you figured it out, you know, sitting down with your first video game console.
1636520	1638680	You're not going to be instantly good at it.
1638680	1639640	You got to figure it out.
1639640	1642280	And the example with the kids with the rotary phone.
1643080	1646160	I mean, they're not stupid.
1646160	1651080	They can they figure it out eventually that, OK, you turn the thing to make the thing go.
1651600	1654320	You know, they know what a receiver is, right?
1654320	1657000	Because it you see it in a movie.
1657960	1663120	No, it's obvious it is one has ear, one has mouth.
1663120	1664080	It's like your headset.
1665080	1668520	And even if you hold it backwards, it still kind of works.
1668520	1670160	I know that from being a kid.
1672440	1679360	All right, let's move on and talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing this week.
1679960	1681200	And I will start with Dark Sakura.
1683360	1686280	I have, of course, been playing Dead by Daylight.
1686640	1696400	I, I, well, yeah, I played Marvel Midnight Suns last night because I got the wrong controller again.
1696960	1699760	I mean, I have a use for it, so it's not that big of a deal.
1699760	1704520	But I bought another controller to see if I can play Star Ocean next weekend.
1705720	1709440	I did all of my testing with Osha Berry Proteus.
1709920	1714680	So there has been some Proteus and Jackie Crush in my life also in the week.
1717000	1731760	And then I played, of course, my stupid wordscapes, because I actually I'm getting to the point now where I'm solving this, the quote, super hard puzzles in 10 to 15 seconds.
1731760	1735520	And and then sometimes my brain is just so like, what?
1735520	1736520	What's this word?
1737520	1739360	You know, so I'm going back and forth with it.
1739920	1749920	And also playing more Beatlemania Pinball because it's fucking fun.
1749920	1753040	We have a Dracula, but I've never liked that table.
1755120	1759080	We, I played something else.
1759080	1762720	And for the life of me, I cannot think of what the crap it was.
1763320	1767720	Now, maybe I'm just thinking of Parodius and Jackie Crush for Super Famicom.
1768280	1774680	But yeah, that's been I'm dipping back into some of my old school loves.
1775200	1782840	And again, if if anyone doesn't know, Jackie Crush is the third in the Crush series of pinball games.
1783360	1786240	So there's Alien Crush.
1787000	1789600	What? Wait, why can't my brain think of the other Alien one?
1789600	1790040	Devil.
1790680	1791400	Devil's Crush.
1791640	1795200	And then Jackie Crush brain farts.
1795880	1802400	And I'm actually thinking about going back to playing Demon's Tilt just on like, you know, off nights.
1802960	1806080	I really it's such a good spiritual successor.
1806080	1807040	It's such a good game.
1807520	1817800	Oh, and I've been sort of laughing to myself about the Dead Hard nerf and the the joke that Behavior made about nerfed the pig.
1817800	1821320	And really, they just gave her an improved one of her perks.
1822320	1824560	Because Behavior gets the memes.
1826200	1827240	That was pretty funny.
1828560	1830160	Oh, yeah, and the circle of healing nerf.
1830160	1831080	There's that too.
1831080	1838560	But that one I'm kind of I'm not like all up in arms about it because I was never a booner.
1838840	1843720	The slower healing irritated about and I can get into that.
1843720	1854560	I wish I'd put it into like my chosen story thing because they they put out a big developer update with a lot of changes that have people losing their shit on the Internet.
1855200	1856840	Because they always lose their shit on the Internet.
1859360	1863760	I'll be right back by continue on Loki when yeah, I'll tell you guys what's going on in a minute.
1864360	1865040	Okay, okay.
1865240	1878160	Well, I mean, just in a nutshell, the big ones that people are irritated about are the Dead Hard nerf, which means you have you now have to have unhook somebody to get the benefit from.
1878200	1878680	I don't know.
1878680	1881840	I hate Dead Hard and I've never used it on purpose except for like twice.
1882680	1886200	And then the the circle of healing.
1886240	1889960	Yeah, still it now requires that you have a medkit to be able to self care.
1889960	1890920	I think that's ridiculous.
1890920	1897160	And then slowing down the rate of of healing with a medkit is also ridiculous.
1901440	1902320	Whatever behavior.
1902720	1903080	All right.
1903080	1905640	But anyway, Loki.
1906640	1917840	I was just working on Minecraft stuff this week, mostly just finishing up a build and editing, still working on editing, hoping to have my new episode out here soon.
1917840	1929640	The problem is every time I introduce a robot master in in the series, I have to hand animate the stage like intro thing that they do in like Mega Man 2 and it takes time.
1930840	1934120	It's annoying, but I have to do it because perfection.
1935120	1938800	So hopefully we'll have a new episode out, hopefully by tomorrow.
1939880	1940360	Awesome.
1940360	1941080	That's about it.
1941160	1941480	Yeah.
1941720	1942200	Good luck.
1942680	1943080	Never did.
1943080	1946520	Is it still no word on the Minecraft contest from a couple weeks ago?
1946760	1947240	All right.
1947480	1948080	I'm trying.
1948080	1948400	I'm trying.
1948400	1948840	I'm thinking.
1948840	1949400	I'm thinking about it.
1949400	1949760	All right.
1951040	1951640	My gaming week.
1951640	1956800	Actually, before I get to my gaming week, let me talk about something else real quick, because it has to do with what I just disappeared about.
1956800	1960760	So, you know, and a lot of you know about, huh?
1961480	1962440	I hope everything's okay.
1962840	1964120	It's actually not about me.
1964120	1964680	It's about Mr.
1964680	1965160	Smoosh.
1965160	1968320	And I think maybe you've caught about some of this from social media and stuff.
1968320	1970960	Oh, maybe no, because I don't really post on Twitter as much as I used to.
1971360	1972200	So here's the thing.
1972200	1972840	Here's what's going on.
1972840	1973400	So Mr.
1973400	1983920	Smoosh gave us a little bit of a scare on Wednesday, and we ended up spending like seven hours at the emergency vet because he was very lethargic, not wanting to move.
1983920	1988680	We could tell he wasn't really wanting to move his back legs like something was kind of going on there.
1989640	1994480	And so we thought he may have had a seizure or something like may have happened.
1994760	2003080	So we took him in and they ruled out that he can still use his back legs because they were warm.
2003080	2003840	They weren't cold.
2004120	2014720	And we ended up going to the ER vet and we spent a lot of money, but well, we didn't spend two because we could have gotten an MRI for $7,000, but I have to draw the line somewhere.
2015520	2028520	So they did some x-rays and we kind of found out the next day that the x-rays were showing that he probably has a calcified disc in his back, which doesn't happen in cats as often as it doesn't dogs.
2028520	2031280	That's usually a thing for dogs, but they say it can happen in cats.
2031520	2032040	You know, Mr.
2032040	2041760	Smoosh is a special cat, but it kind of explains like, oh, this is why when we found him, he was on the stairs, but at the halfway point.
2042000	2047760	And like he didn't want to continue the journey up or down the stairs, whichever way he was going, he was kind of hiding behind the scratching post there.
2048160	2054200	So we've kind of noticed since then, now that we're starting to get some answers, we've kind of noticed that he does have an aversion to stairs.
2054640	2058000	He'll use them if he's motivated by food.
2058560	2060480	He'll still try to go down, even though he shouldn't be.
2060480	2063920	So we have a baby gate on the way from Amazon to try to stave that off.
2065240	2071040	But he'll try to use the stairs still if he's food motivated, but otherwise he's kind of not using it.
2071080	2074160	So we moved all there for those that know the layout of my house.
2074160	2075960	We moved all the cat food upstairs.
2076120	2078160	So the cats have everything they need upstairs.
2078440	2082920	He shouldn't have a need to go downstairs, but he just kind of does it for whatever.
2082920	2084600	You can't tell a cat no, right?
2084600	2085680	Like or stop that.
2085680	2086520	You'll hurt yourself.
2086840	2094280	So, yeah, at the end of the day, you know, the reality is he's an extremely inbred cat.
2094280	2097200	He was a rescue and he was a very special kind of rescue.
2097200	2098560	He has cool David Bowie eyes, too.
2098880	2099480	He does.
2099520	2106080	That's why the thought was originally it could have been neurological because the eyes are a sign that he's always had something kind of up neurologically.
2106400	2110480	But the X-ray kind of makes us think and especially his behaviors.
2110480	2112560	It's like, oh, he has an aversion to stairs.
2112560	2115400	OK, yeah, he doesn't really want to use his back or whatever.
2115760	2117920	But the reality is he's he's old.
2117920	2122040	He's like a 10 year old cat at this point, which for his breed is getting pretty old.
2122400	2124480	So, you know, it was scary.
2124480	2126720	We thought that.
2127120	2131120	Yeah, you got smooshy kind of around the time I got Midna.
2131240	2132680	Well, it was the same year my mom passed.
2132680	2133600	It was twenty seventeen.
2133680	2136560	So and he was already three or four base.
2136560	2138040	And that's based on the vet's estimate.
2138040	2139080	For all we know, it could be older.
2139840	2143280	Yeah, it wasn't too long after I'd gotten Midna and it was just a few years.
2143280	2146560	So it is turning 11 on my birthday next month.
2146600	2148240	Yeah, so yeah.
2148480	2151120	So anyway, not to not to bring and thank you.
2151120	2153960	I see you all in chat sending the love and thank you.
2153960	2156080	It's it's received and thank you very much for that.
2156120	2158360	And I just know, you know, you all know the cat, Mr.
2158360	2158920	Smoosh and all that.
2158920	2160760	But that's just something we've been kind of dealing with.
2160760	2165200	And that's why I just went off screen here, because I can see from where I'm at.
2165200	2169280	I have a view of the staircase and I could see him kind of going meow meow and kind of pacing around.
2169280	2171280	I thought, oh, is he wanting to go downstairs?
2171600	2174360	But Alan thinks he's just hungry because it's about that time.
2174360	2179960	So he's he's just out there complaining about food to anyone that I've had a hard time.
2179960	2180920	Give me extra food.
2180920	2183760	Yeah, pretty much. But he's getting spoiled now.
2183760	2189240	Not only did his dad spend again, I a lot of money on that.
2189400	2192200	I we have a he had expenses.
2192280	2197440	Yeah. And I'm sure I'm sure many folks out there know, you know, it's just one of those things that it's never.
2197600	2200920	And, you know, you're you're you're a captive in that moment.
2200920	2205000	You will do whatever it takes to help your little furry friends.
2205000	2207280	So it's it's rough.
2207640	2211080	I've already decided that with my next cat, I'm getting insurance.
2211120	2212320	Yeah. Yeah.
2213000	2216440	It's probably something I can't I can't afford to get Midna's teeth fixed.
2216600	2221760	Yeah. So I just have to brush her teeth and give her antibiotic,
2221760	2224840	you know, stuff for her water and hope for the best.
2226120	2229880	So and it was interesting watching Cheddar kind of respond to the whole thing, too,
2229880	2232520	because he was kind of like, what the hell's going on?
2232520	2236480	And then he was he was really staying away from all of us when we got back.
2236480	2239520	He would not. And we were like, what's and they were like, oh, because we smell like the vet
2240360	2242200	and all those other animals that were there.
2242200	2245040	So it took him it took him about a day for him to warm back up to us.
2245040	2246880	So this is very interesting.
2246880	2251520	Anyway, sorry not to divert too much, but that's what's going on.
2251520	2256320	So I think now that I think about it, Alan wrote a couple of tweets,
2256320	2259160	but I understand a tweet can get lost amongst all the other stuff.
2259160	2263160	And yeah, it's just hard to update everybody work the last four days.
2263160	2266640	So it's hard for me to to check, except in this little crazy burst.
2266640	2269160	For sure. For sure. Yeah.
2269160	2275480	Anyways, I just going to say Midna has been extra all upon, but.
2275480	2279360	Yeah, she just has allergies. Yeah. Yeah.
2279360	2284440	So when I did play games this week, when I wasn't too taken over by that,
2284440	2288280	I've played a little bit of the Diablo four beta this weekend, although granted,
2288280	2293440	not nearly as much as I was playing last weekend because I finally got that point.
2293440	2297560	As much as I love Diablo four, I've kind of got to that point where I'm like, OK,
2297640	2299760	well, they're going to erase these characters anyway.
2299760	2303000	I've hit twenty five, which is the max level in the beta.
2303000	2307200	And not not only will I have my pet dog thing that you get at twenty,
2307200	2312000	but I can I entered myself into the contest to get painted into the chapel in France,
2312000	2317240	whatever they're doing, if you actually get to twenty five, because that'll be fun.
2317240	2319800	Can you imagine my face in a chapel somewhere?
2319800	2324480	I hope I win. I've never wanted to win a contest more in my life.
2324480	2327160	So I did everything I could do with that.
2327160	2329440	And so I'm kind of at the point where I'm like, OK, well,
2329440	2331000	I screwed around with some of the new classes.
2331000	2333840	But the reality is, let's just wait for the game to come out at this point.
2333840	2335320	I'm happy to stress test.
2335320	2337440	So I did that a little bit this weekend. I played.
2337440	2341520	I sat in the queue for a little bit, but I didn't I didn't need to hit the pavement
2341520	2345800	as hard as I was doing last week and ensuring that I hit the the max level I could.
2345800	2347680	But I'm still loving Diablo four.
2347680	2350280	Absolutely. I'm buying it when it comes out.
2350280	2354760	Can't wait. Other games I've been playing a little bit of theater,
2354920	2355680	but not a lot.
2355680	2357560	I think I did stream that a little bit this week
2357560	2361080	because I finished No Man's Sky Expedition nine on Monday.
2361320	2363360	It only took me about another forty five minutes on stream
2363360	2365120	and I finished the expedition and got the rewards.
2365120	2366720	So, yeah, that was an accomplishment.
2366720	2369000	I beat something that was an accomplishment.
2369200	2371920	And then I played more theater than which I still have not played
2371920	2373720	every song one time yet.
2373720	2376760	There's still like at least probably 50 more songs going to make my way through.
2376760	2379160	But there's just so many songs in that game.
2379160	2383480	So honestly, between all those things, that's pretty much my gaming week.
2383640	2386880	So we'll move on.
2386880	2389200	Let's get into some other headlines.
2389720	2393120	I was trying to think if there's any like housekeeping or programming notes,
2393120	2394400	but not really.
2394400	2400640	We don't have any plan trips or anything that'll get take the show away coming up.
2400640	2403280	So we'll be here for the next few weeks,
2404320	2405840	as long as we have power and all that good stuff.
2405840	2408240	All right, Loki, let's get into some news.
2409040	2410960	Yes, this is a very exciting out of nowhere.
2411000	2416400	There is the announcement that Valve is putting out Counter-Strike 2,
2416680	2419720	which is going to be a free update for Counter-Strike Go,
2419720	2422440	which will completely redo the whole game.
2424120	2427480	So they had some trailers that they put out kind of talk about
2427480	2431440	the different game mechanics that they're adding to it.
2431720	2435960	So, for example, they have volumetric smoke grenades now, which look really cool.
2435960	2438320	They kind of react to
2438320	2441520	bullet shots and also other explosions nearby.
2442080	2444840	They're going to have something that's like a sub tick.
2444840	2447320	So it basically allows for more accurate
2447600	2451120	positioning of players and bullets and that type of stuff.
2451360	2456160	They're overhauling the maps as well as keeping some of the older maps as well.
2456160	2459560	Kind of like the kind of doing it in three different phases.
2459560	2463600	So they have the older maps that they're kind of giving new
2463600	2465800	like lighting effects to and that type of stuff.
2465800	2468000	But essentially, there could be exactly the same.
2468520	2470120	Then there's
2470960	2474520	some updated maps that they're adding, you know, like more features to
2474520	2478280	that kind of utilize more of Counter-Strike 2
2478280	2480760	and then like some fully redone maps.
2481800	2484240	Higher resolution models for the guns.
2484240	2487000	New Source 2 tools for modders.
2488000	2489840	New blood splatters.
2489840	2495720	And see, they said completely re-authored explosions and more accurate audio.
2496160	2497760	It looks pretty sweet.
2497760	2500080	Bigger and badder explosions.
2500560	2504000	Exactly. The smoke, the smoke looks cool, too.
2504000	2506120	Like, I think that's kind of the fun stuff.
2506680	2509880	They're saying that all existing Counter-Strike Go skins will transfer
2509880	2514920	to Counter-Strike 2 and they'll be also more visually detailed.
2515240	2516240	So that's kind of cool.
2516240	2518120	You know, they get all that stuff to go along with it.
2519240	2521280	Yeah. Excited to see what else they do with that.
2521640	2524800	Talk about, you know, last week how gamers are eating good.
2524800	2527960	Well, it's putting more food out.
2528000	2532040	Well, you know, with Counter-Strike, this kind of upgrade,
2532040	2535600	this is a little bit like, you know, Counter-Strike to Counter-Strike 2
2535600	2537600	or I guess really Counter-Strike Go to Counter-Strike 2
2537840	2540880	is kind of like Overwatch to Overwatch 2, right?
2540880	2543760	Like this is meant to replace the base game, right?
2543760	2544760	Well, except more.
2544760	2547760	Like they didn't really do as much into Overwatch 2
2547760	2550400	comparisonally, but it is meant to be a replacement.
2550400	2551720	Overwatch 2 is essentially Overwatch 1.
2551760	2555120	But yeah, yeah, basically it is an overhaul to the original game.
2555240	2557120	OK. And it's meant to replace it.
2557120	2560000	And it is it's it's I think I heard it's going to be free to those
2560000	2562480	that already have Counter-Strike, basically, which I mean,
2562760	2566240	how many people haven't picked up Counter-Strike in some kind of bundle
2566240	2569680	over the years or some kind of sale on Valve?
2569680	2571760	Like that game's been out a long time.
2571760	2573960	You probably have it in your library and you don't even know it.
2573960	2576320	You know, like it's you got it somewhere.
2576600	2577760	So that's interesting.
2577760	2579960	That'll be coming out, you know, the sequel.
2580800	2585000	It's also nice that Valve is finally putting out a game that isn't VR
2585840	2588280	for for the rest of us that, you know, aren't quite on board
2588280	2590280	with the VR stuff still.
2590280	2591520	And it's it's nice.
2591520	2595240	Granted, I haven't played Counter-Strike since the original Xbox.
2595240	2598440	I'm not even talking about the original Xbox last time I played Counter-Strike.
2598440	2601720	But still, it is nice that they still avoided using three.
2601720	2604560	Technically, since this is like the third Counter-Strike game,
2604560	2605880	but it is Counter-Strike 2.
2605880	2609760	So still no threes in Valve's life.
2610120	2613120	They don't have to break their habit there.
2614040	2616080	Yeah. Let's see.
2616080	2620440	E3VL does point out at least they didn't go the free to play model like Overwatch.
2620920	2622440	So that is that is also it.
2622440	2627360	Well, do we do we know of any types of microtransactions,
2627360	2630040	battle passes, things they might be looking to add
2630360	2633000	since they are essentially giving this away for free?
2633520	2635360	Well, I don't think it's anything different than what they have now.
2635400	2636640	Was it the gun skins?
2636640	2638040	Don't they have all that stuff?
2638040	2639560	Like, isn't that a whole thing?
2639760	2643120	Don't they have crates and stuff?
2643160	2644560	Yeah, I guess that's true.
2644560	2647120	Gambling stuff. True, true.
2647120	2648800	I assume that's still a thing.
2648800	2652560	And Chad is debating if this is actually fourth or fifth Counter-Strike.
2652920	2657040	Mike Def says OG Counter-Strike, Source, Go, and now two.
2657760	2660800	E3VL is counting one called Condition Zero as well.
2660800	2663640	So there's been a few Counter-Strike games.
2664200	2665360	None of them number three, though.
2665360	2666720	No, none of them three. No.
2669920	2673480	All right. Moving on, let's talk about this, which, by the way,
2673480	2676040	also kind of plays into the whole like reminders
2676040	2677600	that we're going to be talking about Nintendo.
2677600	2680360	I think we have an email on it later, so I won't go too far in depth.
2680360	2683440	But, you know, we talked about it already last week, really.
2683440	2687520	But the Nintendo eShop is basically going to be closing
2687520	2690520	at some point very soon tomorrow.
2690520	2692520	But we don't know when. Is that 1201?
2692800	2694760	Is that 1159?
2694760	2695960	We don't know when tomorrow.
2695960	2698600	But, you know, we're in the last dawn of the final day,
2698600	2701160	basically, of the Wii U and 3DS eShops.
2702200	2704840	So I know we have an email on it later.
2704840	2705800	I'll wait till we get to that.
2705800	2709960	But, you know, it has a lot of us kind of either making those last few purchases or.
2711360	2713560	For me, I'm kind of like,
2713560	2716000	why would I reward Nintendo for this right now?
2716000	2716560	I'm not going to.
2716560	2719120	But I don't want to tell people what they should and shouldn't do.
2719120	2721160	I understand why people want to do their last minute shopping,
2721160	2722560	get those things where they go away.
2722560	2725040	I'm kind of like, I don't want to reward Nintendo for this decision.
2725040	2727120	Like I bought what I bought and that's it.
2727680	2732960	But here's a concept I do want to reward because I think this sounds great.
2733200	2737360	And this is a retro game project coming out for the Switch.
2737640	2739760	It's called Project Egg.
2740480	2742440	This is still a tentative title.
2742440	2744680	It is from D4 Enterprise,
2744920	2747760	and it's something that they're going to be using to release titles
2747760	2750720	from their retro games distribution service for the Switch.
2751040	2754320	And these are going to be games for platforms like MSX,
2754640	2757760	PC-9801, PC-8801.
2758920	2763040	This is also a platform that's going to be used Pico Pico for smartphones.
2763040	2768240	And they say virtual console for Wii U, Wii and 3DS, but I don't.
2769480	2773320	I think this is because I think they're talking about that
2773320	2776720	they have released games prior on these systems.
2777000	2778680	So if you want to go back and look at those systems,
2778680	2780120	kind of see like what is that?
2780120	2783120	Sorry, that's just a very oddly worded phrase there.
2783120	2786240	But if you want to see the types of games they have released,
2786240	2788480	they're in those archives.
2789120	2794040	Egg, if you are curious, stands for engrossing game gallery,
2794880	2797200	which of course is leading to all of those memes of
2797360	2800000	can I offer you an egg in these trying times?
2800640	2803120	Some of the games I recognize just from the screenshots,
2803120	2805160	I notice Hyde Lied in there.
2806320	2809920	So yeah, this sounds like it's the what I like about it is
2809920	2811960	these are I hope this comes out for the US.
2812120	2814160	It does look very Japanese based.
2814160	2815880	But of course, the Switch is reason free.
2816840	2820200	I hope that there's some really good stuff in there.
2820760	2823240	Like I like the obscure type of stuff.
2823240	2824880	Oh, one of the Cotton Games is in here.
2824880	2826480	I see in the screenshot, actually.
2826480	2828400	I know Jamie loves that series.
2828400	2831160	Revival Xanadu is also called out by name there.
2831160	2835240	So there's just a lot of like obscure but cool titles in here.
2835480	2838240	And that's exactly the types of stuff we should be celebrating
2838360	2839840	in these retro catalogs.
2839840	2841400	So I think this is neat.
2841400	2844840	So props to D4 for working on this and making it happen.
2845120	2848120	So there was a thing it said in there, too, like
2849120	2851800	I noticed like when I translated the what,
2852080	2855840	you know, talking about Project A, it says general creators.
2855840	2856880	It was built.
2856880	2860320	People will be able to sell software created for retro consoles.
2860320	2864720	I guess homebrew software like their PC 8801, PC 9801,
2865000	2869160	X68000, FM7, X1, MSX, et cetera.
2869960	2870760	Holy moly.
2870760	2873800	So looking at this list over on because
2874880	2879480	I guess on Wiki there's actually a big old list there in the D4 Enterprise article.
2879680	2882520	I did not realize it was this large of a library.
2882520	2883360	Oops, sorry, folks.
2883360	2888040	I just accidentally placed this over the webcam capture.
2888040	2889240	But look at this.
2889240	2892400	Like there are one thousand eighty four games on this list.
2892400	2895200	I have no idea how to even organize a list like this,
2895560	2899000	but it does have things for the arcade, including Double Dragon is in there.
2899760	2901880	A lot of Famicom based games.
2902520	2903680	Yeah, Karnov.
2903680	2906000	So you get an idea of the types of like developers
2906000	2907320	that they're working with and so forth.
2907320	2910800	So this is going to be a very beefy collection
2910800	2912160	whenever it comes out for Switch.
2912160	2913680	So that's really cool.
2913680	2915200	So oops.
2915720	2917400	Not that sorry.
2917400	2921760	Having to produce, do camera angles and all that on the fly is hard sometimes.
2921760	2924680	So sorry for the awkwardness on twitch shots sometimes.
2925520	2926360	All right.
2927080	2928240	Dark to see also points out
2928240	2931480	if you want to see a YouTube channel that has short video clips of these games
2931680	2934120	that is also available with Project Egg.
2935120	2935480	All right.
2935480	2939240	Let's move on to some not so great news.
2939240	2942800	But unfortunately, one we're hearing a lot in this industry lately, Dark Sakura.
2944200	2946360	Well, and it's full of a lot of just like.
2948280	2950800	Excuse talk to me.
2950800	2952480	But at any rate.
2953160	2955360	More than 400 Twitch employees
2955600	2958200	got laid off because of what Amazon's going through.
2959160	2962240	Amazon announced another 9000 job cuts,
2963040	2966000	adding to the 18000 layoffs from January.
2967000	2970360	And then about 400 employees from Twitch
2970360	2974120	are affected in that that whole business.
2976000	2980600	Twitch didn't give the impacted employees
2980600	2983720	any sort of advance notice ahead of the announcement on the 20th.
2986000	2989080	The CEO just basically sent out an all staff email
2989280	2992840	that people affected would be informed no later than early next week.
2995360	2997520	And it's just, again, just a bunch of.
2998640	3000640	Excuse talk.
3000640	3005120	The CEO, Clancy, is blaming the layoffs on, quote,
3005760	3009680	current macro economic environment and user and revenue growth
3009680	3012600	that has not kept pace with our expectations, end quote.
3013080	3015320	In other words, I'm going to throw out a bunch of jargon on there
3015320	3017520	and hope that it sounds important enough for you to believe it.
3019600	3021320	In a nutshell,
3021320	3023240	they're not making the money we thought they did.
3023240	3026320	So now we fucked up and now we have to fuck up these people's lives.
3026360	3028680	Well, and who who misforecast that?
3028680	3031600	I mean, I understand Twitch grew a lot during the pandemic.
3031600	3034840	And so there's a little bit of like the tide receding a little bit as,
3034840	3037440	you know, things, pandemic lockdowns
3037440	3039840	practically ended pretty much across the globe at this point.
3040240	3042480	That a lot of that is receding a little bit.
3042480	3045440	But you would think that somebody could have seen that coming.
3045680	3047960	It's weird. But at least there's this.
3047960	3049960	This is this is interesting to me when I heard this.
3049960	3051200	This is the interesting news.
3051200	3055160	Emmett Shearer, the former CEO, just left last week.
3055480	3059600	So I can't sit here and be like, well, why does nothing ever happen to the CEO?
3059600	3065440	Well, OK. I mean, now, do we think that the CEO left because they,
3065480	3068160	you know, did Emmett Shearer leave because this news was coming?
3068160	3070160	I mean, in a variety of ways, probably yes.
3070160	3072960	He probably left when he did. So he didn't have to do this.
3073360	3075320	It's probably one of those things that was brought down.
3075320	3077280	And so he kind of ran off into the night.
3077280	3078880	But at least I can't sit here and go,
3078880	3081720	why isn't the guy who's been CEO for the last few years been held accountable?
3082000	3085120	He did bow out. I will get I will give him that credit.
3086440	3092240	That that there's lots of CEOs in this industry who don't do that.
3092480	3094840	So I'll give him that for what it's worth.
3096440	3099840	But it is, yeah, it's garbage and it's.
3101040	3104200	Instead of investing in their employees
3104200	3109480	and pushing the company to do better or are finding other ways to
3110480	3114960	use that talent pool, they're just saying, oh, no, we just don't want to pay you. Bye.
3117000	3117520	I hate it.
3118680	3122240	Maybe if there was more synergy with the rest of Amazon going on,
3122240	3124080	because that's the other thing that blows my mind about Twitch
3124120	3128440	sometimes is that like I feel like they live in a bubble with that so much.
3128440	3130720	I know I've talked about this on the show and I'm sorry to repeat myself,
3130960	3134760	but that so much of Amazon feels so siloed and that that I'm
3135240	3139960	quite frankly shocked that Luna isn't more integrated into Twitch.
3139960	3142360	Not that I'm saying I want that. I'm just shocked.
3142360	3146120	They haven't taken more of an opportunity to do that. It's wild to me.
3147200	3149880	Yeah, they they are really.
3149880	3154160	They're just fucking the whole thing up.
3154160	3158560	I mean, they acquire a platform that they don't truly understand,
3158560	3162320	you know, to service people who do things that I think they don't truly understand.
3162840	3166560	And then I just don't think that they know what they're doing.
3166880	3167760	I mean, be honest.
3167760	3172480	It should it should be this easy as like if Dark Sakura is going, hey,
3173320	3175560	we need one more for our Swift and Dead by Daylight
3175560	3178200	because somebody could make it tonight. Let's do one more for Swift.
3178400	3182520	You should be able to click a button and fire up Dead by Daylight on Luna
3182520	3184680	and be able to join her Swift right away.
3184680	3186480	By the way, that was a thing in Stadia.
3186480	3188760	But it's not there on it's not on.
3188760	3190000	Oh, Dead by Daylight is not on Luna?
3190000	3192640	OK, bad example. I just assume they put that game everywhere. My bad.
3192840	3196280	OK, but but that example, that example,
3196280	3199840	but a game that is on Luna still should should hold some water here.
3200120	3202680	So I mean, it doesn't really matter the streaming service.
3202680	3205080	If there's a streaming service that's owned by a company
3205520	3209280	that also has live streaming service, you know, like a game
3209280	3212680	streaming service with a company that owns their own streaming service.
3213680	3217040	Like how the Google integration when Stadia was around,
3217560	3221600	you pressed a button and it would link up to a live play on your YouTube channel.
3221600	3225760	Yeah. Yeah, it's it's ridiculous.
3225760	3230160	I mean, Stadia did it right and they got fucked over
3230600	3234440	because Google's got this other weird announcement now
3234440	3236960	about another company that they're working with for cloud based gaming.
3236960	3238200	And I'm just like, I hate you.
3238200	3240280	I officially hate you right now.
3240280	3242360	Don't don't talk to me. Don't speak.
3243160	3244720	I don't hear. Yeah, exactly.
3244720	3247600	Exactly. Talk to the hand because the wallet doesn't want it.
3248600	3251160	Exactly. But but like.
3252360	3259320	I'm just. Maybe it's that I don't have that corporate mindset.
3259320	3262520	I mean, I don't want to be a manager and I don't want to be corporate, you know,
3263360	3267400	but at the same time, you know, I work for a company
3267400	3272600	that is all about utilizing its talent pool instead of laying people off.
3273520	3276280	You know, we have positions open in our company
3276280	3279320	and they're hiring from other groups in the same company
3279680	3282720	to cover those things instead of laying people off.
3283200	3284960	And I can't say where I work.
3284960	3286800	Some of you all know, don't say anything.
3287480	3294400	But I think that that Amazon and a lot of these gaming companies
3294400	3297480	that are laying off all these people need to actually really take a look
3297480	3300600	at their business model and see why they're getting themselves
3300600	3302920	into this puddle to begin with.
3302920	3307760	You know, you can't keep doing things the same way
3307760	3312000	they've always been done and get yourself into this pattern of fuckery.
3312880	3315880	You know, the the quote is the definition of madness
3315880	3318520	is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results.
3319000	3320360	That's exactly what you're doing.
3320360	3323960	You're hamsters in a wheel and the wheel keeps spinning and spinning.
3324680	3326640	You need to do something different.
3326640	3329120	You need to take a risk and do something fucking different.
3330440	3331800	I want to get the comments from chat.
3331800	3333040	There's a lot of good stuff in chat right now.
3333040	3336160	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says there's also political infighting
3336160	3337400	inside these large companies.
3337400	3339520	Different divisions don't necessarily like each other
3339520	3341480	and will not work to help everyone else.
3341480	3344720	So the Luna and Twitch teams might not be on good terms with each other
3344720	3346920	and are actively avoiding having to work together.
3347480	3348400	Oh, my God.
3348400	3351760	Then that if that if that I mean, I know that's hypothesizing,
3352040	3355600	but if that was a thing, then that falls on Jeff Bezos
3355600	3359960	to walk in there and say, you fucking make it work, period.
3360680	3363080	And the head of Luna and the head of Twitch,
3363080	3366520	your asses are on the line to make this work like it.
3367640	3368480	This is wild.
3368480	3372200	I mean, I'm not disputing what you're saying, Bobby,
3372600	3374480	but it's it's it's wild to me
3374480	3377280	that that can happen in a profitable company.
3378160	3379400	If your job.
3379400	3382000	I'm sorry, I forgot Jeff Bezos was retired, but you know, you know what I mean.
3383320	3386240	If your job is to do
3386680	3390040	what is necessary as dictated by your upper management
3390360	3393640	to make something work, it does not matter
3393640	3395920	how you feel about working with another department.
3397000	3398280	End of story.
3398280	3400600	Your assignment is to work together.
3401160	3404160	So if they're not working together, this is coming from higher up than they are.
3406280	3409440	Fixation Gaze says it feels like Amazon is using Twitch
3409440	3412600	as a passive income and get upset when record profits
3412600	3415160	manipulating a sick market aren't beaten.
3415840	3417680	Absolutely. Absolutely.
3417680	3421880	This is just supposed to be Amazon's little money printing thing,
3421880	3424280	and they're not thinking about how they can better integrate it
3424280	3427800	into the rest of their business and make it more profitable from that standpoint.
3427800	3429240	It's very silly.
3430880	3434880	Phil of nine says, I always wonder about how huge these tech companies got.
3435080	3437440	It always seemed like they ballooned so quickly.
3438520	3441720	2003 called and says
3442600	3445040	history repeats itself.
3447200	3450600	But yes, I mean, but that's exactly what I was saying about that pattern
3450600	3453480	that no one seems to learn from, you know?
3454400	3457480	And honestly, you know, what took down the Roman Empire,
3457920	3460000	the fucking Roman Empire?
3460240	3461400	That's going to happen again.
3461400	3464520	The companies are going to get too big, too big, too big and explode.
3465880	3468600	WN record or is it WN record?
3468600	3471240	Because English is a silly language, but I'm going to guess record.
3471240	3473240	WN record says it's nutty.
3473240	3476960	How many companies are doing record business and still laying off?
3476960	3479480	Well, that's CEO salaries.
3480000	3482720	It has to do a lot with their projections
3483320	3486520	and, you know, taking into account things like inflation,
3486520	3488760	operating costs, ongoing projects.
3489360	3492560	You can bring in a current higher profit
3492560	3495080	that if it's not going to accommodate your projection.
3496280	3501240	Or your expected operating costs in the next quarter or next year.
3502280	3505520	Then. It actually makes perfect sense
3505520	3508320	why they would try to take preventative measures
3508800	3512080	to preserve their income rate.
3512160	3516400	But you're also right, it does go back to the CEOs and and whatnot.
3517360	3519840	Maximum wage laws.
3519840	3522800	I also agree with Fixie that, quote,
3522800	3525720	these kinds of layoffs during a global recession should be negligence.
3525720	3530200	Absolutely. And I mean, you want to look at like what a good example is.
3530920	3533600	Look at what Iwata did.
3534240	3538240	Yes. When Nintendo took their big dip, it's the pay cut.
3538680	3541880	And you know what? I think that should be the rule for a CEO.
3542240	3545200	You know, if you're if your company is fucking up
3545200	3550320	and you are the leader of said company, you take the hit, not your employees.
3550920	3554000	People only think about themselves.
3554120	3558560	Greed begets, you know, wealth begets greed is what I think.
3559040	3561160	The more you have, the more you want.
3561160	3563560	And you think someone's going to try to take it out of your hand.
3563560	3564680	But guess what?
3564680	3568360	You don't need as much money as you're making to live.
3568760	3571840	You don't. And that is OK.
3572680	3577480	The money that these people make, they can put it into a money market
3577480	3581160	or a CD or something and live very comfortably
3581320	3583920	and very extravagantly off of the interest.
3583920	3586040	And that's the problem that we're having right there.
3586040	3587840	All these fuckers need to get taxed.
3587840	3588880	But that's another story.
3588880	3593160	But that is why the gamers really respected Iwata and miss him greatly.
3593600	3595400	He was one of the greats.
3595400	3598440	So his memory be a blessing.
3598440	3599680	In other Twitch news,
3599680	3603080	we actually kind of have a companion article to this of some sort, Loki.
3603960	3609200	Yeah. So, of course, you know, Twitch is saying that right now
3609200	3614680	it's the best place for creators to stream and make money, apparently.
3616680	3618680	I mean, sure, yeah, they're going to say that.
3618680	3621160	I mean, why wouldn't they say that? They're always going to say that.
3623000	3626000	But apparently talking with the Verge,
3626000	3629360	you know, Tom Varelli said that
3629360	3633160	I don't think there's ever been a better time to start streaming on Twitch.
3633640	3636000	We've talked a lot about how we're going.
3636040	3638360	We're in this together and we're part of this innovation.
3638360	3642120	We're we're committed to continuing to improve our monetization products
3642440	3644840	and building new monetization products.
3644840	3645760	At the end of the day,
3645760	3648440	we are committed to increasing the amount of money streamers can earn.
3649840	3654680	Oh, you know, I mean, because like you just like reduced your split of,
3655080	3661080	you know, revenue from 70 30 down to like, you know, 50 50 for everybody.
3662720	3667640	And then on top of that, like you have these new apparently
3667680	3673160	ad incentive programs that you provide to certain affiliates.
3673160	3677120	I guess that if you run a certain number of ads in an hour,
3677120	3681400	a ridiculous number of ads, then they'll pay you like extra money.
3681400	3684120	But it's not even really that much money on top of it.
3684680	3688040	Um, not to mention that if you're running that many ads,
3688040	3690280	you're probably going to lose engagement anyways.
3690280	3692040	One of the other things, too, on top of that
3692040	3694920	is that their ads program that they have right now,
3694920	3698160	if you run less than three minutes of ads in an hour,
3698160	3701840	you're actually only making 30 percent of the revenue from that, not even the 50.
3702160	3706000	You have to run, I think, over three minutes of ads per hour
3706000	3710320	to get that full 50 to 55 amount from them.
3710600	3713200	I didn't even know they changed that.
3713200	3715800	So it's it's it's been like that for a while.
3716600	3719000	Yeah. So it's just it's not really.
3719920	3722880	I think they're going to have to try a lot harder ovens, you know?
3723120	3724320	I mean, yeah.
3724600	3728320	I mean, no company's going to come and go, yeah, we're just like terrible.
3728320	3730600	Like maybe you shouldn't use our service.
3730600	3732360	Like, of course, they're going to say
3732360	3735440	you're the best place because they're going to do that.
3736000	3738920	Um, I mean, what other choices you have, you have YouTube
3738920	3742440	and then there's the other startup that just kick.
3743680	3745640	Yeah, you're thinking of.
3745640	3746480	Yeah, I think so.
3746480	3750080	I'm I'm laughing because I just went on there this weekend just to claim my name,
3750080	3752320	you know, just just in case, because you never know.
3752560	3754000	But I was just kind of poking around.
3754000	3760000	And it definitely like it just feels like a we want to be Twitch type of plan.
3760000	3763200	Like I'm looking at the content that's being featured and I'm just like,
3763200	3765120	none of this looks like something I'd enjoy.
3765120	3768480	Sorry, I'm just telling it like it is like it's just I it just
3768840	3772240	I wasn't seeing a lot of like compelling content
3772320	3774360	from what I was seeing there on the screen.
3774360	3780240	It looks like a lot of people who just want to be the next megabucks streamer
3780240	3783600	and playing those types of games or gambling simulators or whatever it is.
3783600	3787160	Like I just I was I looked at the website and I was bored.
3787560	3790680	That was that was my quick review of kick.
3790680	3791800	Sorry, but that's what I mean.
3791800	3793840	And you know what? It's still young.
3793840	3794800	It's in its infancy.
3794800	3796920	May it grow into something bigger? Possibly.
3796920	3799080	Could I be eating crow later on? Who knows?
3799080	3802240	I'm just saying how I feel today and what what I saw in that site
3802240	3805680	when I went today, but we'll see. So, yeah.
3808680	3813880	I but it does seem like Twitch runs mainly unopposed.
3813880	3816000	So I mean, I guess there's YouTube.
3816000	3817800	I guess you could count kick,
3817800	3819960	but I don't think you can until they have a mobile app,
3820160	3821880	which apparently is coming very soon.
3821880	3825160	But, you know, until that day, none of these compared like
3825160	3828840	and there's been every year there's some new up and comer
3828840	3830520	that wants to take on Twitch.
3830520	3833880	Unless you have a mobile app and you have some more integration
3833880	3838720	on other devices than just PC screens, you can't be taken seriously. Period.
3839160	3843720	So anybody that wants to take on somebody has to be able to at least
3843720	3845760	bare minimum have a mobile app.
3846880	3851320	To do that. Exactly, especially in this age. Seriously.
3852000	3855960	An interesting perspective from Fixation Gaze here in chat,
3855960	3860080	who says, just to add something to the best place for creators.
3860080	3862120	A year ago, I had my own experiment.
3862520	3865760	When I included the autistic tag on my screen streams,
3866000	3870160	I was less likely to end up recommended by about 75%.
3870640	3874120	It's only the best for certain creators who start the game famous.
3874320	3877720	Plus, most creators rely on subs to survive over ads.
3877720	3881440	Oh, definitely. Ads, ads make literal pennies.
3881440	3884920	I'm not, you know, even though I'm like, oh, they changed it like years ago
3884920	3887840	and I wasn't paying attention. I'm like, it doesn't matter. It's pennies.
3887840	3891200	If I don't have thousands of viewers, it's not going to matter.
3891560	3896320	But, um, uh, but that's, that's very interesting about the tags,
3896320	3900560	because something I do notice Twitch added just in the past couple of months
3901120	3903560	was that you can see how your tags perform.
3904080	3906640	And I am a little bit surprised, well, I'm not totally surprised,
3906640	3910880	but a little surprised at which ones perform a lot stronger than others.
3911760	3913840	And I think that was interesting.
3913840	3916400	I don't know how to see how you're getting recommended, though.
3916440	3918920	That's, that's interesting. So.
3921040	3923880	All right. Well, let's move on. We have more news to cover.
3923880	3928960	So let's talk about some news from Atari and a game
3928960	3932840	that I remember Dark Soccer talking about on this show not a terribly long time ago
3932840	3936000	in her Classic Game of the Week segment, and that was the game System Shock.
3936520	3940000	Because System Shock has a remake that they've been working on for a while,
3940000	3942240	and we still don't know exactly when it's coming out.
3942240	3946160	But the publisher, Prime Matter,
3947000	3950520	apparently is actually going to be getting picked up
3952000	3954560	by Atari, although this,
3954680	3959480	the story I linked here has to do with that we do have a date of May 30th
3959760	3961440	for that actual release.
3962360	3966920	This has been in development since 2015,
3967240	3971080	and it was originally supposed to come in the summer of 2021.
3971080	3974360	And this, of course, is a remake of the 1994 first person RPG
3974560	3978600	that's going to be coming for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One,
3978600	3980720	and Xbox Series X.
3982720	3986920	But Atari is also purchasing Night Dive Studios,
3987160	3990280	and they're buying it for 10 million in cash.
3990560	3993840	And this is supposed to help Atari expand their catalog
3994080	3999520	and using technology and boosting a retro focused strategy.
4000280	4004760	Although a lot of those recent retro releases out of Atari have not been bad.
4005040	4008640	So, you know, I don't mind if they're kind of continuing to lean into that
4008640	4011680	because a lot of the recent releases really haven't been bad.
4012280	4015160	But as we know, I mean, and certainly it's better than some of the other stuff
4015160	4019200	Atari's gotten into recently, like crypto, online casinos,
4019440	4021920	and they're bringing up themed hotels here.
4022960	4024800	We never did see the hotel.
4024800	4027120	Let's give that one a chance first.
4027120	4031200	I thought that sounded interesting, but no hotel as of yet anyway.
4032080	4038360	So anyway, Night Dive should be helping them to bolster their actual game
4038360	4042840	library a little bit with things that aren't necessarily just the retro stuff.
4043280	4047240	So, all right, moving on, Dark Soccer.
4049200	4053560	Couldn't hit get my button hit fast enough.
4054600	4059040	There's a comic that I was super into, so excited about when it came out,
4059040	4062600	which was I've been reading the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
4062800	4065160	more recent issues, which I super love.
4066040	4069600	But there was a series that came out called The Last Ronin,
4069960	4076880	which is about this sort of super futuristic New York area.
4077280	4081400	And of the four turtles, only one of them survived.
4082600	4086400	And you don't find out who it is until the end of the issue.
4087200	4091400	But they are working on a game based on it.
4091600	4094160	It is a really good series, but it is dark.
4095200	4096600	It was published in 2020.
4096600	4099200	It was a five issue miniseries by IDW.
4101280	4104920	So at any rate, the game is going to play something
4105600	4107840	they're actually working with Paramount,
4109200	4112360	but it's going to be a little bit more adult themed,
4113720	4117080	a little bit darker, grittier,
4118640	4121600	and it's supposed to play as they've outlined
4121680	4123840	a little bit more like God of War,
4125320	4126800	you know, very mature.
4126800	4129560	They don't OK, they don't have a developer yet,
4129960	4133640	and they think it's going to be at least a few years out
4133640	4135920	from any sort of release date.
4135920	4140840	But I think it's I think it's pretty I would play the hell out of it.
4140840	4141680	I really liked it.
4143160	4145400	I have to admit, I didn't know a lot about it until I saw the story,
4145400	4147880	because, you know, anything Ninja Turtle related Tiger Claw
4147880	4148760	posts in our Discord.
4148760	4149640	So that's how I saw it.
4149640	4151840	And I was kind of like looking at it going, oh, that's interesting.
4151840	4152920	I didn't like the new movie.
4152920	4154480	I didn't even know that was a thing.
4154480	4157400	Yeah. And then.
4157400	4158480	Wait, new movie?
4158480	4160600	Yeah, there's a new animated movie that's coming out.
4160920	4163320	The animation style is sort of like the
4164040	4166360	not exactly, but kind of like the
4167400	4171920	enter the Spider-Verse stuff, like it's that karmic, a comic panel style.
4172120	4173320	It looks really nice.
4173320	4175960	Like it, I think it's going to be cool.
4175960	4179480	Well, but anyway, the big thing that I'm looking forward to
4179480	4182160	is seeing how the different weapons are incorporated,
4182160	4184960	because the survivor carries the weapons of all four of them.
4186120	4188080	And on top of that,
4188080	4193440	in the comic, he would hear sort of, I guess, like the voices of his brothers.
4194360	4196120	And talk to them.
4196120	4200760	So I'm wondering if maybe hearing those different voices in gameplay might,
4200960	4205800	you know, access, like like talk, talk to the voice of this one
4205800	4209600	to get insight on this might give you different pointers
4209600	4211120	and clues throughout the game.
4211120	4211840	I think that would be cool.
4213520	4215920	All right. Yeah, I'm looking forward to it.
4215920	4218720	And if you want to join our Discord to talk about,
4218720	4221240	you know, Ninja Turtles or other things throughout the weeks,
4221240	4223280	we get a lot of neat news
4223280	4226600	posted in the Orange Dance Radio channel and some of our other channels as well.
4227120	4229800	Head on over to our Discord over at vognetwork.com.
4229800	4232440	That's vognetwork.com slash Discord.
4233400	4237440	All right. This this next story is is something else, Loki.
4239680	4242800	Yeah, it's it's unique, that's for sure.
4242800	4251000	So apparently there is a game that's been made by MSCHF,
4251400	4253360	which is a Brooklyn based art company
4254800	4257320	that is called Tax Heaven 3000.
4257320	4263280	It is a dating sim that helps you do your taxes.
4265800	4267640	It's interesting for sure.
4269760	4272640	So it will actually help you walk through
4272880	4276840	the process of filing a 1040 US tax return.
4277720	4281640	The problem is, though, it's been delisted off of the websites
4281640	4284800	that it's been on, probably because it asks for your Social Security number,
4284800	4289680	which, yes, that is part of the tax process, is providing that information.
4289680	4292000	However, would I trust the game to do that?
4294720	4296360	Questionable.
4296360	4299640	It doesn't appear that the game is supposed to connect to the Internet,
4300120	4302800	but still kind of fishy.
4302800	4305440	So it has been removed from Steam.
4305440	4309160	And I think the download is not available anymore for itch.io either.
4309160	4310520	But it looks silly.
4310520	4314000	And, you know, it does allow you to actually file your taxes.
4314200	4318040	But, you know, to be fair, I mean, tax season is right now.
4318040	4320680	And I mean, there's lots of free websites that you can do it through
4320680	4324200	that are way more reputable and probably
4324200	4326480	a lot more easier to actually file your taxes.
4326480	4328800	But it's still a novel idea.
4328800	4332560	I it's interesting because I heard this story at first and I kind of laughed at it.
4332560	4334800	And I went, LOL, of course, there's something like this.
4334800	4339000	But then the more I thought about it, I was like, is this is this really so bad?
4339600	4344760	Like, it's not like I think this is more respectable
4344760	4347280	than some of the things these companies try to pull over.
4347520	4351600	And some of these websites that have you do your taxes, that bombard you with spam.
4351880	4355440	Oh, it looks like you forgot to finish your taxes or trying to upsell
4355440	4356960	all this other stuff and all this other crap.
4356960	4361840	Like I there's a part of me that kind of looks at this and goes in a weird way.
4361840	4365520	This is this is it's either satire and it's really good satire,
4365840	4371040	or it's a really interesting way to try to get a hold of a market
4371320	4376720	that otherwise doesn't usually think about a fun way to kind of do this stuff.
4377680	4382040	Well, yeah, taxes are a slog a lot of times, so it's an interesting idea.
4382280	4386040	If if there was some way to like, they could have like an independent
4386040	4389360	security firm or something like that, take a look at it, make sure like, OK,
4389360	4392880	hey, we're certifying that this isn't going to send your social security
4392880	4396360	number and personal information out on the Internet, then.
4396360	4397840	Yeah, sure. You know, why not?
4397840	4398760	Let's let's roll with it.
4398760	4401760	But like, I think that's just where people are a little weary,
4401760	4404840	because, like, you know, you all know who these developers are.
4404840	4408720	I mean, obviously, these this company has worked with like big names
4408720	4411080	like Lil Nas X and stuff on other projects.
4411560	4415080	So they're somewhat reputable, but like, you know, you can never tell
4415080	4417160	like who's developing your games and stuff like that.
4417160	4418480	You don't know.
4418480	4419880	You wouldn't want to trust them
4419880	4423400	with that kind of information because leaks happen all the time. So
4424680	4427040	that's the only thing I think people are a little bit wary on.
4427040	4430560	And obviously, that's probably why it's been delisted off of there.
4430560	4435120	But like, I mean, I assume security side,
4435400	4438400	you know, security aside, if if it were completely secure.
4438600	4439800	Yeah, I think it's a great idea.
4439800	4441280	I think it's cool.
4441760	4444480	Well, this is so Fixation Gaze has a comment in chat here,
4444480	4447080	and then I think it kind of leans into what you're talking about,
4447080	4447960	where you're going with this.
4447960	4450720	Fixation Gaze says TurboTax makes it racing themed.
4450720	4452880	I'd rather date a cute girl.
4452880	4454960	And Dark Soccer, I saw you said same.
4454960	4459960	And I and that's the thing is that I can't help but feel like
4460560	4461880	who's the company behind TurboTax?
4461880	4463560	Intuit, I think is the name of them.
4463560	4467400	I can't help but feel like come tax season 2024,
4467400	4470920	or I guess it would be tax season 2023 in 2024.
4470920	4471960	You know what I mean?
4471960	4475280	I can't help but feel like Intuit is going to see what's going on here.
4475560	4479480	And they're I'm not saying they're going to have an anime thing,
4479480	4481560	but they're going to have they're going to be like, ooh,
4481800	4485800	what if we did like a video game, more immersive type of approach
4486000	4489720	and hire like an outsourced developer to do some type of thing
4489920	4493360	and like put it together and do that whole thing and have it through that?
4494080	4495720	I have to end Fixation Gaze.
4495720	4497920	I understand you're saying, God, I hope so.
4497920	4500160	KFC did a love sim and it was popular as hell.
4500640	4501680	In a way, yes.
4501680	4505200	But I actually have to say, if Intuit was allowed to do that now,
4505200	4507160	I'd actually be kind of pissed off.
4508960	4510400	That this got shut down.
4510400	4513440	Now, granted, it is the fault of the company that put this together
4513440	4516600	to not think about those security motions in place and dah, dah, dah, dah.
4516880	4520520	But I would be more irritated at the fact that the big company
4520520	4524560	took the little company's idea because they had a legal department
4524560	4527720	to make it better, make it more functional, if you will.
4527920	4531800	That part of it would kind of piss me off, I think.
4533120	4535320	But I feel I feel like.
4536760	4540640	And thank you, he says, oh, that's so fair, I want them to hire them,
4540640	4543840	give the small guys money, much better solution, I like that.
4544480	4547440	But I feel like that's not a company like just sorry,
4547440	4550160	just based on the behaviors I see in the TurboTax software and all that.
4550400	4551960	I feel like they're going to go to somewhere
4552000	4554840	they can get an outsource in another country
4555160	4560480	and have it developed to be like this and do that whole thing.
4560800	4562280	Yeah. So watch it.
4562280	4564640	It's going to be next year's tax season.
4564640	4567280	So apparently, even though it's been delisted from Steam,
4567280	4569120	so itch.io still has it up.
4569120	4571160	I didn't realize that the game is not actually out yet.
4571160	4572960	So it's coming out April 4th.
4572960	4575920	So if you're still interested, it is on itch.io.
4576320	4578800	You can still get it that way.
4578840	4580240	How do you ultimately file?
4580280	4583400	Does it e-transmit or do you like since, or do you print?
4584400	4587880	It's basically it looks like that you.
4588680	4591360	Yeah, you can either print or download it when you're done.
4591360	4594520	So it basically fills up the form for you and then you print or download it.
4594520	4597600	And I guess you would e-file that way somehow. I don't know.
4598200	4600520	I'll be perfectly honest.
4600520	4603840	I don't want my tax thing as a game. I'm sorry.
4604560	4606600	I would rather fill out the form.
4607560	4611800	Have it be uninteresting, but factual without any fluff.
4612920	4616080	And get my taxes filed and get my money.
4617400	4619400	Taxes don't need to be a game.
4619400	4621560	I can see pros and cons to both.
4621560	4622960	I love the choice.
4622960	4627320	And to me, this is very similar to traffic school.
4627920	4629560	And how do you like, you know, obviously,
4629560	4631800	we all try to avoid getting a ticket and all that stuff.
4632160	4635680	But if you ever get a ticket, you could go to stand up comedy
4635680	4638640	traffic school if you want, where the whole thing is.
4638640	4641280	Yeah. And I already see Rolling Your Eyes, Dark Sakura.
4641520	4644120	And that would honestly, that probably be what I would want to do.
4644320	4648280	But if you want to go to a, for lack of a better term,
4648440	4651920	normal traffic school, that's just, all right, give me the facts.
4651920	4655280	Just don't don't be funny about it. Just normal classroom.
4655280	4658040	Let's get this over with online training.
4658040	4661400	And just did the test and was done in 10 minutes.
4663000	4664520	So but there's that choice.
4664520	4668240	So I like that that would be kind of available. So.
4669280	4672240	And yes, April 15th is typically tax day,
4672240	4675520	although holidays have been fluctuating that day a little bit weird calendars.
4675520	4677080	It's around the 15th.
4677080	4679360	So it looks like April 18th this year.
4679360	4684200	And also this year there's like things like with the weather and stuff.
4684200	4686800	I think that it's possible for certain people to have it delayed
4686800	4689000	until like September even. But.
4691000	4693160	Yeah. Yeah.
4693640	4695520	So fixation is April 1st,
4695520	4699400	maybe the cutoff for TurboTax before the prices go up,
4699640	4702440	because the last two weeks before you file your taxes,
4702440	4705960	they're going to jack those prices sky high because that's what those companies do.
4706320	4707440	Just don't use TurboTax.
4707440	4709760	Seriously, like there's websites out there
4709760	4713040	that you can use that are probably way more intuitive.
4713040	4714720	And I think it's like.
4715240	4719400	It's free to e-file your just regular federal
4719400	4723120	and if you want to your state of things like 17 bucks, it's like it's so.
4723480	4725520	Minimal. And I do it every year.
4726560	4729000	Yeah, it's just so easy.
4729200	4733480	Our our lady who used to help us, she passed away a few years ago.
4734600	4736400	R.I.P. Kathy.
4736400	4741280	But but yeah, she basically walked us through so many different things
4741280	4744600	that we just use the age in our block software. Yeah.
4746120	4749000	All right. Anyway, tax tips from Orange Lounge Radio.
4749000	4751240	Bet you didn't know you'd get that this week. All right.
4751280	4753880	Moving on, let's go to one more.
4753880	4755880	If you're confused, hire an accountant.
4755880	4758360	Yeah, that's that's very true.
4758360	4760240	Disclaimer, we are not accountants.
4760240	4762680	We're just, you know, nerds of the podcast. All right.
4763320	4766320	I can rock an actuarial table for your mortgage, OK?
4767840	4770200	I used to work for a mortgage company.
4770200	4773240	All right. Well, here's what you can expect to hear on Orange Lounge Radio
4773240	4776200	every single goddamn week for the next two years.
4776200	4779240	No, the Activision Blizzard Microsoft deal.
4780000	4784840	What's the latest and greatest MST3K?
4785680	4787720	Well, whoopty shit.
4787720	4790200	Well, some people are saying whoopty shit this week
4790200	4793720	because there was a pretty big hurdle that was actually cleared in all of this.
4793720	4796360	And that is the UK regulators.
4796360	4799480	The UK regulators did announce a provisional finding
4799800	4803280	that the acquisition of Activision Blizzard by Microsoft
4803520	4806040	wouldn't harm competition.
4806040	4809120	So there's not going to be a need, at least in the UK,
4809120	4812120	again, this has to still clear the US and, you know, other global markets,
4812360	4816280	but that there's no need to spin off Call of Duty and so forth.
4816760	4822200	In a quote, the CMA Competition of Markets Authority in the UK said in a quote,
4822960	4825840	while the CMA's original analysis indicated
4826080	4829800	that the strategy would be profitable under most scenarios, new data,
4829800	4832360	which provides better insight into the actual purchasing behavior
4832360	4835920	of Call of Duty gamers indicates that this strategy would be significantly
4835920	4838200	loss making under any plausible scenario.
4838520	4842360	On this basis, meaning if they were to make Call of Duty exclusive to Microsoft,
4842360	4844480	it would actually lose Microsoft money.
4844480	4848440	On this basis, the updated analysis now shows that would not be commercially
4848440	4852400	beneficial to Microsoft to make Call of Duty exclusive to Xbox following the deal,
4852520	4855600	but that Microsoft will instead still have the incentive
4855600	4857800	to continue making the game available on PlayStation.
4858000	4860360	It all comes down to Call of Duty.
4860360	4864760	Now, CMA is still investigating cloud gaming and Game Pass.
4864760	4868320	No decision on that is expected until 26th April,
4868320	4869640	since we are talking about the UK here.
4871320	4874720	They're still looking at Game Pass, but Call of Duty was sort of viewed
4874720	4878160	to be the biggest sticking point in this entire thing.
4878280	4882920	And now that that's cleared by the UK, this is a huge hurdle cleared for this.
4883040	4887440	And a lot of people that were kind of betting on this, metaphorically,
4888280	4892120	were assuming that the UK was going to put a stop to this and it was going to be over.
4892240	4898040	So the fact that this went through now and a lot of this, too, is kind of Sony's own fault.
4898720	4903880	And so because Sony admitted that they were just trying to stop this deal,
4903880	4908280	that they really don't have a financial that that was going to be that's going to be looked
4908280	4912680	at as a defining moment in this whole thing, the way that Sony kind of botched that answer,
4912920	4914800	although it was also an honest answer.
4914800	4916560	Let's be real. It was the answer.
4917160	4924200	So anyhow, SHO 100 Matt says the FTC and whatever members of Congress will make a scene
4924200	4927960	for in a few weeks in the public sphere, but I still think this deal happens.
4927960	4932280	Oh, if that whole stuff with TikTok is any indication.
4932280	4933320	Oh, boy.
4933880	4937960	But I don't think I don't think I mean, you're not going to see that in this type of thing.
4937960	4940520	I'm being a little bit dramatic.
4940520	4944920	You're not going to see them in front of well, I don't think I guess anything could happen.
4944920	4948680	But procedurally, that is not something that should be happening as a part of that.
4948960	4956600	So anyway, all right, let's move let's move on to a simpler time when Congress didn't understand
4956600	4957400	video games at all.
4957400	4958640	Well, actually, that still is the case.
4958640	4961400	But anyway, we're going to just move on to our next segment.
4961400	4977560	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull
4977560	4979400	out a classic and tell you about it.
4979800	4982520	It's time for the classic game of the week.
4983080	4985800	Um, who picked the classic game this week?
4985800	4988640	Because is this is this a secret Loki pick?
4988640	4989560	What's going on here?
4989560	4990800	This looks like a Loki pick.
4991760	4993440	No, but I thought of Loki when I think.
4993800	4994080	All right.
4994080	4995560	What is the game of the week?
4996280	4998280	The game of the week is Grand Theft Auto Vice City.
4998400	4999080	Wow.
4999960	5007080	And yes, it's actually a a twenty one year old game.
5007080	5007920	It can drink.
5009360	5011880	It's as old as this show about.
5014160	5017480	And I picked it actually for for certain certain reasons.
5017480	5025760	Um, but yeah, I know I almost went with Grand Theft Auto three because Grand Theft Auto
5025760	5032880	three was the first one to abandon that sort of overhead view and go on to the the third
5032880	5033640	person view.
5033720	5040240	But Vice City had some massive improvements over Grand Theft Auto three.
5040240	5045800	And while Grand Theft Auto three went into creating immersion and a story and everything,
5046120	5049320	I really think the formula was perfected with Vice City.
5050040	5055760	So, um, to go back into this, there were a lot.
5056280	5061600	Well, again, it was it came out in 2002, an action adventure game developed by Rockstar
5061600	5067200	North, published by Rockstar Games, and it is the fourth Grand Theft Auto game and I'm
5067200	5070120	sorry, the fourth in the series and the sixth installment overall.
5070800	5081640	It is set in 1986 with a pretty freaking amazing soundtrack, just saying where you are in Vice
5081640	5089840	City, which is based off of Miami and Miami Beach, and you follow a mobster named Tommy,
5090160	5099200	who has been released from jail and is it's his rise to power again, but not necessarily
5099200	5108120	just that, but his, you know, just a statement about the area, about the time, about that
5108120	5110840	world, of course, you know, a little bit more glamorized.
5111400	5115960	But the you know, the great thing about the game that started again with Grand Theft Auto
5115960	5124640	three is that it's an open open world, you know, it's and it's got real people in it,
5124640	5135520	you know, like it touches on the immigration issues that were going on in Miami and along
5135520	5143760	the Gulf Coast, especially with Cuban, Haitian immigrants, biker games, the crack epidemic,
5144800	5147280	the and a glam glam metal.
5147680	5153240	We can't forget glam metal, you know, the whole the whole beautiful butt rock back in the
5153280	5163320	day. But the game itself had two major influences and it was Scarface and Miami Vice, you know,
5163920	5166040	the original Miami Vice, not the remake.
5167000	5169360	Yeah, very, very Scarface.
5170040	5180840	But it had they they started off with those sort of blueprints, the universe idea, and then
5180840	5185320	they built their game world to fit that inspiration in that general time field.
5186240	5195360	They had the team spend a lot of time in Miami and looking at landmarks and trying to
5195440	5196680	recreate some of these.
5196680	5199760	And that's been an ongoing theme in a lot of the Grand Theft Auto games.
5200200	5207440	I mean, like Liberty City is based off New York and has, you know, some recreations of
5207440	5211840	some of those, you know, areas at least trying to fit those areas where San Andreas had,
5211840	5217040	like, you know, the the Chinese theater, for example, and other parts of Los Angeles.
5218560	5225400	But going back, going back to this one, this game was actually considered as one of the
5225400	5228280	greatest video games ever made by many, many lists.
5228560	5233600	And it made Game of the Year for a bunch of different publications.
5234040	5237240	It has gotten so many ports.
5238080	5240760	We'll get into that a little bit later.
5243360	5248680	But anyway, as I was saying, it's an action adventure game is played from third person.
5248680	5257760	You play Tommy Verchetti, who has different story objectives that he needs to achieve.
5257760	5264600	And then there's also little side jobs and there's a free roaming aspect, very open world.
5265520	5268280	And you can just do nothing but explore.
5268280	5273800	You can spend a day just doing whatever you want, like actual people do.
5274720	5279440	And it is composed on these two islands with several small areas within like, you know,
5279840	5286640	like a neighborhood, you know, the islands unlock more areas as the story progresses.
5286640	5291920	You know, you run, jump, drive, you have melee attacks, you have all kinds of weapons
5291920	5299560	and explosives, such as a Colt Python, an M60 machine gun, a minigun, a sniper rifle,
5299560	5303800	a rocket launcher, you know, because I everyone doesn't ever have like a rocket
5303800	5305520	launcher just hanging out in their trunk or something.
5306080	5307120	Oh, yeah, in the garage.
5307840	5315240	Yeah, but you you actually, you know, can purchase illegal weapons from firearm dealers.
5315400	5317360	You can find them on the ground.
5317480	5318840	That always makes me laugh.
5319120	5321800	You retrieve them, you know, from dead people or just in general area.
5321800	5326800	You have an auto aim feature and you have your your health meter.
5326800	5328040	You can pick up health pickups.
5328040	5329280	You can get body armor.
5331080	5337720	And then, of course, when you, quote, die in game, you respawn at the at the hospital,
5338000	5341200	losing your weapons and armor and some of your money.
5342160	5347240	And then, of course, you associate with her, Matt says, I mean, it is Florida,
5348600	5354200	but you also can commit crimes and it builds up your wanted meter on your HUD.
5354560	5357480	And so it increases the more crimes you commit.
5359240	5366400	And so your wanted meter, if you're encountered, like, say, by police, you
5366400	5372480	have to drive around or turn off or hide to get them off of your ass.
5373120	5378080	So like there's all kinds of other like interesting little mini games in there,
5378400	5384920	like vigilante vigilantism, firefighting, paramedics driving a taxi.
5386080	5391600	You can buy businesses like a porn studio and a taxi company.
5391960	5396360	You can own clubs, you know, all kinds of stuff like that.
5396520	5400720	And then, you know, and I'm not going to get too much into the story.
5400720	5405800	If you really if you haven't already played it and you care about it, there's videos.
5407120	5416200	But but the particular game was started when GTA three was finishing its completion.
5417440	5423160	Just early development, like 3D models, really just getting that off the ground.
5423160	5428800	And then they were talking about like making a mission pack for GTA three.
5429280	5434160	And then instead of that, as they were going through it, they decided to make a GTA four.
5435280	5440480	The game was announced on May 22nd, 2002 at E3.
5441480	5446360	And it was at the time, Rockstar's North most expensive game.
5446400	5448840	The budget exceeded five million.
5448840	5454240	And then they had to postpone it a little bit and then.
5456480	5459840	It had like a number of various releases.
5460280	5465680	It was released for PlayStation two on October 29th in North America, November 8th in Europe.
5465720	5467280	This is in 2002.
5467680	5472640	Capcom published the game in Japan on May 20th, 2004 for PS2 and Windows,
5472960	5477080	and it was added to the Rockstar Games Launcher in September of 2002.
5477080	5480400	Rockstar Games Launcher in September 2019.
5482640	5485840	Now, I'll be honest, it's not my kind of game.
5485880	5487360	I don't enjoy.
5488600	5494640	The themes of the game, however, I fucking love watching people play it because I like
5494640	5503280	seeing how in depth the universe that these people live in, how how in depth and involved it is.
5503280	5504880	It's like, you know, me watching a movie.
5505080	5507760	The movie could be utter shit with the worst actors ever.
5507760	5513880	But if it has an engaging universe, I'm down, you know, like.
5515200	5518520	I'm not going to name any other examples on there, but it really
5519920	5526200	you can even see it if you look at the cover of the game, that that major Miami vice
5526200	5533040	with the pastels and the and the neons, just that whole I mean, sort of like how the retro
5533040	5537600	new wave things started coming back up a few years ago, very much makes me think of that.
5537880	5540760	So how well did it do when I make a guess?
5541640	5544560	Damn well, it printed money, it printed money.
5546680	5553800	Metacritic calculated an average store, a store, a score of ninety five out of a hundred.
5554600	5556280	That's pretty damn good.
5558640	5562040	It is the fifth highest rated PS2 game overall.
5563480	5565960	Tied with a few others, but, you know, overall,
5567840	5571920	a lot of the criticism for the game had more to do with the controls
5571920	5574560	and a few technical issues than anything else in the game.
5574920	5578120	It was considered to be one of the most impressive games.
5578560	5584240	And this is my favorite description of it from GameSpy's Raymond Padilla.
5584960	5587840	Deep, devilishly enjoyable and unique.
5588400	5590080	Devilishly enjoyable.
5590080	5591400	I'm going to steal that one day.
5592040	5598480	But let's go over just like with some of the other ratings were all game gave it a five out of five.
5599600	5601000	Eurogamer, ten out of ten.
5601000	5602200	Gameformer, ten out of ten.
5602200	5605360	Game Revolution, a GameSpot, nine point six out of ten.
5605720	5607720	GameSpy, ninety five out of a hundred.
5607720	5609520	IGN, nine point seven out of ten.
5609520	5612880	So, I mean, really, really amazing.
5613200	5617280	And it got a vehicle to ride that the last game didn't have.
5617280	5618480	You can ride around on a motorcycle.
5618480	5621960	You know, get your own wood rash on.
5623880	5630280	But it's it's just the Windows version, even that came out in May 2003,
5630600	5635200	and it was also highly acclaimed with its scores rivaling
5635400	5638600	maybe just under the console version.
5640560	5643880	They were, you know, it got really
5644840	5649280	a lot of kudos for its improvement in the rendering, like improved draw distance
5649800	5653480	and fewer texture issues
5654720	5657760	and actually having very reasonable requirements.
5658280	5664960	So Vice City was also released on mobile devices December 2012.
5665400	5666960	It was mostly favorable.
5666960	5671120	You know, a lot of the problems with it, it had actually enhanced visuals,
5671120	5673120	but the problems with it were the touch screen controls.
5674800	5677200	It was pretty, pretty well received overall.
5678400	5681560	But yeah, the game has made so much money.
5681560	5684560	And honestly, people are still all about it.
5685320	5687320	But then, but then.
5688360	5691520	There were a few controversies
5691520	5695360	because you can't have a GTA game without, you know, controversies
5695360	5697000	and Grand Theft Auto.
5697000	5702040	No, I'm and the other reason I picked this one is
5702040	5704920	I didn't want to deal with the fucking hot coffee thing.
5706960	5712000	But anyway, part of, you know, people, of course,
5712000	5716600	there was the violence issue, the objectification,
5716760	5721360	a lot of the ethnic stereotypes,
5723600	5728480	you know, just like, you know, showing that people immigrated
5728480	5731280	from a certain place were, you know,
5732320	5734760	drug dealers or thugs or whatever.
5736960	5739240	But, you know, and of course,
5739240	5743920	and it was it was a mature game in Australia.
5743920	5748120	It was actually edited a lot to get an M.A.
5748120	5750760	15 plus classification.
5750760	5753680	And then there was later on an uncensored version
5753680	5755920	that came out over there that kept its classification.
5757400	5761280	There was a six hundred million dollar lawsuit
5761280	5764920	against Cody Posey, Rockstar Games, Take Two Interactive
5765240	5767880	and Sony claiming that
5769760	5772960	14 year old Cody Posey played the game obsessively
5772960	5775680	before murdering his father, stepmother and step sister
5776280	5778240	at a ranch in the Hondo, New Mexico.
5780280	5784000	And they were also, though, blaming Zoloft.
5784480	5787080	Just I take that I haven't killed anybody
5788360	5789320	that I'll talk about.
5789320	5790880	I'm kidding. Haven't. Haven't done it at all.
5791800	5794320	But the case was dismissed in 2007
5794320	5798720	as New Mexico had no jurisdiction for Sony or Take Two.
5801000	5806400	Another there were other cases out there, as in Jack Thompson.
5808760	5813360	Not that name again, but it's been a few years.
5814480	5815880	I feel like it's been a decade.
5815880	5819400	He slid into obscurity some time ago and rightfully so.
5820400	5822760	Yeah, but he he brought up
5823800	5828760	a lawsuit about an eight year old named Devin Moore,
5828760	5832400	who killed two Alabama police officers and a dispatcher
5832760	5835720	before fleeing in a patrol car and was apprehended.
5836040	5838280	And he was quoted saying, life is like a video game.
5838280	5839800	Everyone's got to die sometime.
5841640	5846840	But. Thompson removed himself from the case,
5847840	5850760	actually, from a couple of cases that he had been involved in
5850760	5853360	because of his unprofessional conduct.
5854520	5858640	The Supreme Court rejected an appeal to and they dismissed the case
5859040	5862800	and rejected the appeal by the defendants to dismiss the case.
5864160	5867520	Moving on the psychic readers network.
5868520	5872560	And they sued Rockstar over a character named Ante Pollay,
5873120	5875760	which doesn't that mean chicken play?
5876240	5880160	Anyway, saying that the characters between her and
5882240	5884600	Yuri Harris, who voiced the character,
5886760	5889800	that it was copyright infringement
5889800	5893480	and that it was it was really just parody.
5893720	5896440	So, yeah, there were
5897440	5900120	its legacy has been pretty, pretty intense.
5900120	5903520	You know, it's definitely raised the bar for for video games since then.
5903840	5906440	Oh, gosh. Yeah, I think it was disbarred a while ago.
5906440	5909360	I don't know. I didn't care enough about the about the loser to
5910040	5912880	look into what happened to him.
5912880	5914880	But it has had so many releases.
5915400	5918840	So there for all the ports
5919280	5921880	after the PS2 version, there was a Windows version.
5923640	5926960	There was a GameCube version that was planned, but canceled.
5927320	5930160	It was bundled with Grand Theft Auto three and a compilation
5930160	5932840	titled Grand Theft Auto Double Pack on Xbox.
5933880	5937720	The Xbox version also had a custom soundtrack
5938120	5940920	and improved audio models, reflections.
5942000	5944600	And it also the double pack was also bundled with
5944600	5947800	San Andreas compilation called Grand Theft Auto, the trilogy.
5949240	5954960	The trilogy was also released for Mac OS X, November 12, 2010.
5955240	5957320	It's OS X, not OS X people.
5957520	5959840	X is a Roman numeral.
5960680	5965440	It was also released on iOS and Android,
5966840	5969480	following more of the Windows version of the game,
5969480	5972120	but had enhanced visuals in the customized layout.
5974320	5976480	There was also a Fire OS version,
5976480	5980480	an emulated version of Vice City was playable on PS3.
5981440	5984920	That was with the PlayStation Network's PS2 Classics.
5985200	5988880	Another emulated version for PS4 upscaled to 1080p
5989120	5990480	with PlayStation Trophies.
5992600	5997600	There is a remastered version called the Definitive Edition
5998760	6003120	that was released on Windows, Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox One,
6003120	6009560	Xbox Series X slash S, more versions for Android and iOS in development.
6012040	6014960	Another group reverse engineered the game
6014960	6017960	and released it as an executable in 2020.
6019240	6025400	It was called ReVC that lets you put it on Switch, Vita, Wii U.
6026240	6030520	Take-Two issued a DMCA takedown on the project.
6032800	6036880	But there's a lot more about just where it stands in legalities.
6036880	6040320	You know, there are people then trying to reverse engineer it
6040320	6044080	and put it everywhere and Take-Two is like, oh, no, no, no.
6045440	6047120	Bad people, no.
6047120	6048080	But that's it.
6048080	6051600	I know there's a lot to cover on that one and I glossed over a bunch.
6053800	6057240	If you're interested, though, there there's a really good
6057240	6058400	I'd have to find it again.
6058400	6061920	There's a really good documentary about the entire evolution
6061920	6066760	of the Grand Theft Auto series down to every new version
6066760	6069400	in the platform that it was on.
6069400	6073720	And I highly recommend watching it if you're really interested in it.
6074400	6079600	Um, Boz, there was no code for hot coffee and it wasn't even in this game,
6079600	6082320	which is why I didn't do the game that the hot coffee was in.
6085240	6088880	Because as part of this, which a great pick for Classic Game of the Week,
6088880	6091280	obviously had to be done eventually,
6091280	6094280	because it got brought up, I also was legitimately curious
6094280	6095880	whatever happened to that bitch.
6095880	6101440	So I went to the wiki for Jack Thompson to see whatever happened to that bitch.
6101720	6103200	And yes, you all are right.
6103200	6104040	He was disbarred.
6104040	6105920	We, you know, we covered that a million times over.
6106160	6110200	It's interesting because the it talks about his activities through about 2008,
6110200	6113920	2009, and then there's nothing but a single sentence.
6113920	6119280	And again, this is it's sourced, but it's yeah, it's sourced, but it's it's wiki.
6119280	6121120	So, you know, whatever anybody could have written it.
6121400	6128360	But in an April 2016 interview with Inverse, which is an online magazine,
6128880	6134600	Thompson stated he was teaching civics classes to inmates in the Florida prison system,
6134880	6138320	including an American history and constitutional law class
6138320	6140600	at the Everglades Correctional Institution.
6142520	6143080	So.
6144160	6145800	As a fellow inmate or?
6145800	6146960	No, no.
6147520	6148040	Oh.
6149560	6151240	So, oh, God.
6151240	6153440	Did you see the section about Janet Reno?
6153440	6154280	No, I didn't.
6154280	6156440	I didn't want to read everything.
6156440	6157160	I have to.
6157200	6158200	This is great.
6158240	6158640	OK.
6159880	6164680	He met Janet Reno in 1975, applied for a job, but was not hired.
6165200	6165760	He.
6168160	6169240	He had.
6170720	6175720	Sent her a letter to have her check a box to indicate whether she was homosexual,
6175720	6180040	bisexual or heterosexual, and then she put a hand on his shoulder and responded,
6180280	6182040	I'm only interested in virile men.
6182040	6183320	That's why I'm not attracted to you.
6184000	6187840	I miss Janet Reno.
6188040	6192000	Like the thing the thing I miss about Janet Reno most was that when Will Ferrer
6192000	6194720	would parody her on Saturday Night Live with the dance parties,
6194720	6198640	not only was that whole thing really funny, but she came on and did one.
6198840	6201080	And they had a laugh together.
6201080	6203640	Like she was very like self-deprecating in that way.
6203640	6205200	And, you know, that's it's great.
6205880	6212280	And for anyone who only knows him about this, he was also the one responsible
6212280	6220240	for the lawsuit against NWA, 2 Live Crew, all of that going on.
6220840	6222760	Oh, that's how he got famous.
6222760	6224480	I'm using my quotey fingers in the first place.
6224720	6226520	He went around a bunch of rap.
6226520	6228040	He went after a bunch of rap groups.
6228600	6234440	He went after Ice-T for for that rather famous song of his and Madonna.
6235840	6237120	So, yeah, whatever.
6237120	6237720	Anyway.
6237720	6238200	All right.
6238680	6239040	All right.
6239040	6241640	Well, there's your update on that one.
6241760	6242200	All right.
6242200	6242800	Moving on.
6242800	6246960	Let's talk of the sickest of sick burns from Janet Reno.
6246960	6249840	Let us not speak of his name again for another seven years.
6249840	6250240	All right.
6251000	6251640	Moving on.
6251640	6255560	Let's talk about some other things going on in the gaming industry, but we can do it quickly.
6255560	6256840	Loki, rapid fire news.
6257480	6261760	Yeah, as we talked about last week, there was a game that leaked out and now there's the official announcement.
6261760	6264160	So it's Lego 2K Drive.
6264160	6266320	It is an open world racing game.
6266320	6269880	Kind of think of almost for maybe a little bit of Forza, but obviously not.
6270840	6274720	But it is a Lego game and you drive and race around.
6275640	6278000	Unfortunately, it is a 2K game.
6278000	6281120	And with that, there are season passes.
6281120	6283880	There are in-game currencies.
6283880	6291120	There are monetization's and there are seventy dollar price tags, assuming you buy the base game.
6291120	6297560	In which case, then also it could be upwards to ninety nine or even more than that for the game.
6297560	6303200	So. That's probably a pass for me, even though it does look cool, but like.
6304400	6305800	No, no.
6308160	6313480	And then, of course, you know, continuing on with their cereal domination,
6314000	6317560	Minecraft is doing yet another cereal this time.
6317560	6321440	They are doing Minecraft flavored Frosted Flakes, I guess.
6321440	6324640	It basically has marshmallows in it and their square marshmallows.
6325360	6329600	It's better than their first cereal to ruin cereals by putting in gross marshmallows.
6329960	6336080	I mean, yeah, well, they're their original Minecraft cereal that they have and my kids have had.
6336320	6343280	It was like cinnamon cereal, but like not cinnamon sugar is like cinnamon with marshmallows.
6343680	6347600	So I'll take Frosted Flakes with marshmallows over cinnamon with marshmallows.
6347600	6350320	I don't know why they keep doing cinnamon, like stop doing cinnamon.
6350320	6354800	I also cannot stand the concept of marshmallows and cereal because I don't.
6354800	6357560	OK, because I'm the weirdo. I don't like my cereal and milk.
6357560	6359240	I like to just eat cereal.
6359240	6365040	But the marshmallows that they put in cereal is meant to be put in milk to actually become full marshmallow.
6365880	6367440	But there's gross anyway.
6367440	6369880	Marshmallows are gross, but these are the gross of the gross.
6369880	6371880	Yeah, but the licorice of marshmallows.
6371880	6373680	I love the dehydrated marshmallows.
6373680	6376800	I love I love Lucky Charms because like you chew into the marshmallow.
6376800	6378760	It's kind of like chewing on an eraser.
6378760	6380200	It's just great. I love it.
6381200	6386280	I could. And now keep in mind, I was I was the kid that liked Grape Nuts.
6387040	6390360	Yeah, I'm like, I like Frosted Mini Wheats.
6390360	6392720	That's that's my favorite.
6392720	6393880	You know what? You know what?
6393880	6398760	My cereal, so like I'm on both sides of the spectrum with cereals there.
6398760	6404040	So like it's either like Captain Crunch or Total.
6404880	6405720	I love Total.
6405720	6406680	See, here's the thing.
6406680	6410720	A diabetes diagnosis will change your perspective on cereal significantly.
6410720	6413560	I don't I can't there's an interesting brand.
6413560	6417240	I'm not going to name it because they pay a lot of money for advertising on social media.
6417240	6423680	But there's there is a brand that is trying to make low carb cereal and they actually sell it at Target now.
6423680	6426120	And I've had it and it's it's OK.
6426960	6428600	But it's all about portion.
6428600	6429360	You haven't heard of it?
6429920	6431240	No, I'll text you.
6431760	6433320	I have Turbo. I don't watch ads.
6433720	6437440	Oh, no, no, it's it's oh, you don't you don't read Facebook, it's Facebook ads.
6437680	6442760	So Facebook, Facebook, I've completely divorced myself from the entire Facebook universe.
6443920	6447240	Jealous, but it's easy.
6447240	6449080	Just don't do it. Yeah.
6449080	6452040	So but yeah.
6452360	6454560	So there's there's a very popular brand.
6454840	6456800	Yes. Deft said it in chat.
6456800	6460120	That's as much as I'll give you for the podcast for the podcast.
6460360	6463080	All right. But it's it's OK.
6463360	6470240	But you can kind of tell that you're eating something that's like, I can't believe it's not cereal.
6470600	6475400	Like it's like it's very it's it's the margarine of cereals.
6475600	6476400	It really is.
6477080	6477440	All right.
6477440	6483200	And Bobby, just just as an FYI, the rest of my family is on Facebook.
6483320	6484840	I'm still not going on there.
6484840	6486680	If they want to talk to me, they can message me.
6489080	6490680	Family, who talks to them?
6490720	6491760	All right. I'm just kidding.
6492280	6493880	I talk to my dad as much as I can.
6494360	6499960	All right. Moving on, let's move on and oh, we still have actually I'm sorry, some stories here.
6499960	6501160	Let's go to Dark Sakura.
6501160	6502880	Oh, this is another interesting collaboration.
6502880	6504560	I love this. Yeah.
6504560	6512240	And I kind of don't know what to think, except I need to just like go buy a bunch of this and then have a place that has an accessible bathtub.
6513800	6515880	But they are selling.
6516120	6520520	Lush has a collaboration with the Super Mario Brothers movie.
6520920	6528320	And they have a series of bath soaps to, quote, power up your bathing.
6528920	6539240	There's a cola scented Mario shower gel, apple for Luigi, a warm and spicy Bowser shower jelly and a peach shower jelly.
6540160	6542000	So, yay.
6543120	6546600	But the thing that I care about is the question block bath bomb.
6546880	6550720	And I am going to quote the article here because they did miss a freaking opportunity.
6550960	6552640	They should have called it a bath bomb.
6554480	6557480	Oh, they should have called it a bath bomb, I love that.
6559160	6572800	But at any rate, you drop the question block into your bath and you get a super power toy, a coin, you get a fire flower or, you know, a star or, you know, one up or something.
6572800	6580640	And like, I'm not going to lie, I got some of the Hello Kitty ones for the same thing.
6581760	6584120	So I would do this.
6585840	6587280	It just depends on what it smells like.
6587320	6592240	I am like ridiculously sensitive to some smells.
6592440	6600680	I like Lush, but I get like, I kind of feel high when I'm in there too long, like overstimulated.
6600680	6602560	It is an overpowering, yeah.
6603360	6610640	And also, I still have the same chocolate lotion bar that I bought five years ago.
6612080	6614480	I've almost used it up, but I still have it.
6617280	6621920	I actually, it's one of those things where it's like, I love me a bubble bath.
6621920	6626840	I do, especially now that Alan and I have a house with a tub that lends itself to being able to do that.
6626840	6629480	Like, I'm going to have to go to Lush.
6629480	6641000	And that's one of those places where you walk in there and those hounds that work there will upsell you, upsell you.
6641000	6643720	They're so, so good at that stuff.
6643760	6648800	Like, I'll go into Lush and like $100 later, I'll be like, why did I buy all this shit?
6649440	6651880	But anyway, but I do love me a bubble bath.
6652320	6655880	So, all right, moving on.
6656320	6657440	Let's talk about...
6658440	6660280	Body washes soap.
6662520	6662840	Yeah.
6662840	6664200	Just saying it's for a tiger claw.
6664520	6665120	It doesn't.
6665520	6665920	Yeah.
6666600	6669440	I don't even know, what did Lush pull on YouTube?
6669440	6670400	I didn't know about a thing like that.
6670400	6672760	I didn't know about something that they did on YouTube.
6672760	6673440	So...
6673680	6676560	Well, let me read this while I wait for elaboration on that.
6677080	6680400	Let's talk about the Bloodstained Curse of the Moon Chronicles.
6680400	6683480	There is a physical switch bundle that is being announced for Japan.
6683720	6688920	And that is going to come out with an art book, a two-disc soundtrack CD and an acrylic keychain.
6689200	6693040	It's being released on July 13th for 4180.
6693040	6696880	I'm sorry, the regular edition is 4180 yen.
6697080	6702360	The premium limited edition, 9980 yen for that.
6702360	6708040	And again, this is for Bloodstained Curse of the Moon, which basically if you're a Castlevania fan, this is all you have now.
6708560	6711520	So, some people may be interested in that.
6712520	6719280	All righty, Fixation Gay says, Lush bought a URL that a small creator was using and YouTube basically let them steal it.
6719280	6726640	Oh, you know, we had brought up that site Kick earlier, and I heard a similar thing happened over there, which is not a good look for them.
6726640	6730800	And that was actually the whole thing that made me go think, oh, I should go state claim to my name over there now.
6731040	6733280	Not that it's going to matter, but I don't think there's a...
6733280	6736720	Why do you think I have never let go of DarkSakurai.com?
6736720	6737520	Oh, I don't believe you.
6737920	6746080	I don't think there's a lot of people using the name Rob Roberts, but I know there's a politician in the UK who is apparently an arsehole, from what I understand.
6747360	6749640	But I don't know much about him.
6749640	6752200	But apparently there's a politician over there who's got a lot of troubles.
6752680	6754520	I share my stage name with a porn star.
6755800	6758360	Well, and the Bionic Woman, for God's sake.
6758360	6762160	No, no, no, I spell mine differently than the Bionic Woman, remember?
6762160	6764840	No, OK. Oh, you mean down to the spelling.
6765240	6775400	Yeah, down to the spelling, because because the Bionic Woman is J-A-I-M-E-S-O-M-M-E-R-S and mine is J-A-M-I-E.
6775640	6777800	I get pissed off when people misspell my name out here.
6777800	6784680	I'm looking at you, everybody ever at Starbucks and S-U-M-M-E-R-S.
6784760	6786280	So, so, yeah.
6786760	6792120	Um. Although, Rob, you remember this, Jessica's ex.
6793280	6799560	Yeah, and I had the same name down to last name, and we got each other's mail
6800640	6807840	and I still got his mail years after they were they were broken up until I got married.
6807880	6813360	Yeah. I'm not saying what my old name was.
6813360	6816440	Of course not. The concept of a maiden name is disgusting.
6817920	6825360	All right. Let's move on and try to check out some releases, things that will be coming out a little sooner than the Curse of the Moon Chronicles bundle.
6825880	6828480	World release date starting in the U.S., Loki.
6829320	6836000	Yeah, we have Nine Years of Shadows on PC and Crime Boss, Rock K.
6836000	6837120	City. That's awesome.
6837120	6840520	Can't wait to play that. That'll be coming out this week as well.
6840840	6850360	Last of Us Part One on PC, MLB The Show 23 on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series.
6850880	6853640	Sifu on Xbox One and Xbox Series.
6854040	6859880	Dredge on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series.
6860400	6863200	The Great War Western Front on PC.
6863680	6871440	Raven Bound on PC, Saga of Sins on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series.
6871880	6878080	Blade Assault on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series.
6878120	6878680	That is it.
6879840	6890640	All right. Going over to Japan on the 30th of March on the Nintendo Switch, we have Serial Cleaners is coming out.
6891400	6892960	Is this a game? What I think it is.
6892960	6904040	Oh, no, I literally thought this is going to be a game about cleaning, like Powerwash Simulator, but like next level, like for people who just can't get enough, never be clean.
6904320	6905360	I thought it would be that.
6905360	6906960	Speaking of Serial Mom.
6906960	6909240	No, sadly, it is nothing like that.
6909240	6919680	It is about, it says straight out of 90s, but it's getting rid of bodies, making the place spotless and don't get caught.
6919920	6928240	You alternate between four characters with a unique skill set, and it's set in the era of 90s cult movies.
6928280	6929560	So I guess that is interesting.
6929560	6932000	You're cleaning up crime scenes.
6932280	6935200	I guess that is kind of an interesting concept for a game.
6935200	6937080	So that is out on the Switch this week.
6937640	6940400	Also, Tales of the Neon Sea also out this week.
6940600	6942160	Winning post 10.
6942720	6944720	That's right. Winning post series.
6944720	6945600	It's still going.
6945600	6948560	And Koei Tecmo is putting out the 10th version in Japan this week.
6949560	6951160	That is all on the Switch.
6951440	6960880	Also in Japan on the PlayStation 5 this week, The Chant, as well as Tales of the Neon Sea, winning post 10, not skipping the PlayStation.
6960880	6962560	So it's out there as well.
6963280	6964960	Let's move over to the UK.
6964960	6965560	Dark Sakura.
6966400	6967360	Bare handful.
6967760	6972240	On the 28th on Switch, we have Session Skatesim.

6979120	6985320	Dredge for PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch, not to be confused with The Dredge, most annoying killer ever.
6985320	6986000	Well, one of them.
6986440	6992320	And then also on the 30th, we have Sifu, Vengeance Edition for Xbox.
6994480	7001560	All right, we have a few more stories for you, and then we have the mailbag as well as your calls, if we have any tonight.
7002560	7003840	vognetwork.com.
7003840	7008160	That's vognetwork.com slash Discord is how to join our Discord server.
7008960	7009720	Let's move on.
7009720	7011080	We have some more stories.
7011080	7012720	So let's go over to Loki.
7013800	7015720	Oh, yes, I'm so excited.
7015760	7021200	The news that Ubisoft is going to use AI to help them write dialogue.
7021600	7022520	That's great.
7023360	7024600	We know how that goes.
7024640	7030840	Can the AI help them write, make better games that aren't all derivative of the Far Cry?
7031320	7034480	The AI can run companies more effectively, it turns out.
7037200	7039280	They've developed a tool called Ghostwriter.
7039320	7054440	It says, introducing Ubisoft Ghostwriter, an AI tool developed in-house that aims to support our scriptwriters by generating the first draft of our NPC barks and phrases or sounds made by NPCs when players interact with them in the game world.
7054920	7063360	It says the tool was created hand in hand with scriptwriters to create more realistic NPC interactions by generating variations on pieces of dialogue.
7063920	7069640	And yeah, neat, I guess.
7073920	7075080	I don't know, like,
7075080	7093960	Ubisoft of all companies, you know, really hearing that some of the work is being tasked to AI, like, I just, I feel that like, their games already feel like they're generated by AI, like, let alone, you know, actually using AI for stuff.
7093960	7101000	I understand that this is kind of, you know, to save some time, but not a great look.
7102000	7111240	Can the AI solve the problem of, you know, the rampant sexual harassment that's going on in the company? Can Ghostwriter take care of that too?
7112600	7120040	As I said earlier in the show, the AI can make a better CEO for the company than Bobby Kotick.
7121040	7127520	Let me actually so while you were saying that I actually just threw this into the Google bard thingy thing.
7127520	7135600	So let me show that and by the way, why is it now? It didn't used to do this. But when I try to set up b roll on my other monitor, it makes your guys's squares gray.
7135600	7143920	It didn't used to do that. I have to figure out what's going on behind the scenes. So sorry about that. But I just said I said, Okay, make up a new killer for the game Dead by Daylight.
7144400	7153000	And it says, here's a new killer that I'm not going to read the whole thing, but it came up with a killer called the puppeteer. The puppeteer can control the movements of other survivors by using a special puppet.
7153200	7159480	The puppet can be used to attack survivors, block them from escape routes, or even force them to self sabotage. Okay, this all sounds fine and good.
7159520	7162120	The what? The bellmaster from VHS?
7162120	7175280	This clearly was stolen from a fan thing or another game even like you're suggesting from somewhere. Right? That's that's the whole thing where like this-
7175280	7176920	Orange, right, we already have the pig.
7177400	7187120	This AI thing is kind of going, right? And fixation gaze says, yeah, that's someone's idea, right? And and I realized the usage of the term AI is a little bit nuanced.
7187120	7202880	I'm using that here because that is what the industry and most, you know, commentators are saying right now. I realize, you know, some may say this is like machine learning, or this is just this is just really let me Google that for you to the next level because it's using a lot of predictive stuff to do this.
7203080	7211440	But my point is, a lot of what just came up in that little thing about make up a new killer that was stolen from somewhere. I guarantee it.
7211440	7219560	Yeah, from Reddit, because I just searched Dead by Daylight Puppeteer. And there's someone that there in this big old thing.
7219560	7227600	An AI cannot create its own answer without having learned it from other sources. That is the essence of machine learning.
7228040	7229360	Exactly, exactly.
7229960	7236520	So, I'll, yeah, I mean, I've taken a few courses on machine learning lately.
7237640	7247520	The, for anyone who's saying, oh, it's going to be able to make these logical decisions and everything, all of its decisions are going to be based by the input of whatever goes into its database.
7249280	7251800	I mean, some of the stuff that they've seen, and not necessarily-
7251800	7253320	This isn't Detroit, y'all.
7253640	7266480	But like GPT-4, whatever, they've been doing a hustle GPT, where they basically feed in like, okay, hey, you have $100 to spend, you know, we're going to start a business that's going to make as much money as possible.
7266520	7273200	You tell me what to do, and I'll do it. And then it'll basically walk you through the whole process of doing everything.
7276360	7277040	I'm going to see-
7277160	7278600	Actually making money with it, too.
7279560	7284200	I did this earlier and I got an answer and I have to share it here because you guys will get a kick out of this.
7284200	7291280	Okay, here we go. So I asked Bard, what is the longest running video game podcast?
7292200	7299640	And it told me the longest running video game podcast is another show, which has been running since 2002.
7299640	7304720	It's a weekly radio show that is broadcast live on the internet and is also available as a podcast.
7304720	7308400	This particular show also started on the radio somewhere.
7309000	7312840	And I actually, I'm not sure that's the year they actually started.
7312840	7314520	I have to go look it up or whatever.
7314760	7319840	But if you didn't know, this show has been running since June 23rd, 2002.
7319840	7325600	And we're pretty confident we're the longest running video game podcast, weekly, uninterrupted at this point.
7326440	7331960	So, and I like if this had come up and said gamer tag radio-
7331960	7332760	Except for Star Trek Cruises?
7333040	7333560	What's that?
7334080	7334760	Except for Star Trek Cruises?
7334760	7336120	Well, yeah, uninterrupted.
7336720	7339360	Every show gets, people take Christmas and New Year's off.
7339480	7348760	Anyway, if this had come up and said gamer tag radio, at least I would have understood that one because, you know, he puts out multiple episodes a week and he crossed 1000 episodes some time ago.
7348760	7353120	So I would have at least kind of got like, it's kind of your perception of what is longest to me.
7353120	7355200	It started in 2006.
7355400	7357360	We are the longest chronologically running.
7357360	7362120	So it's not even correct on the year that they started, which no disrespect to this show.
7362160	7363320	They work very hard.
7363320	7365120	This is not about us versus them.
7365120	7373080	This is just about, we're very proud of the long legacy that this show has created and the fact that people still don't know about it.
7373320	7377720	And like, you know, we're somehow that cool indie band, 21 years after the fact.
7377720	7378960	We're very proud of that.
7378960	7388240	And so I just, I get irritated because actually, if you go in and you look at some of the, one of them, like one of the suggestions even said they're the Guinness World Record holder.
7388400	7390800	And that's what I went, hold up.
7390920	7392840	But I actually couldn't find anything to source that.
7393160	7394760	Yeah, Bard made that shit up.
7394760	7396120	I tried to apply.
7396160	7396640	I do.
7396640	7397080	I do.
7397080	7399080	That's why I went, hold the fuck up.
7399120	7400520	That's exactly why I did that.
7400760	7401040	Right.
7401760	7403400	We have to apply as a company, by the way.
7403400	7403720	Yeah.
7404360	7410120	So yeah, if you search for one life left, it says, I was trying to do a call out post Loki.
7411080	7411800	I don't care.
7411800	7412160	Whatever.
7412480	7421360	Uh, even say it's the world's longest, the world's longest running video game podcast, which is false.
7422240	7424000	So yeah, it's,
7424240	7428480	I want to be, I want to be clear because I don't, I don't want a silly war starting because we're all in it together.
7428480	7429520	We're all podcasties.
7429760	7431720	This is not an us versus them thing.
7431720	7439480	This is just an AI doesn't get the facts right because it can't be nuanced enough sometimes.
7439960	7441720	So it's, that's what it is.
7441760	7453400	So anyway, but so the whole MPC dialogue and my point I was trying to make was that sure it can, and I realized they're not going to be using literally Google Bard or chat, GBT or whatever, but whatever it is they're using.
7454000	7461240	You know, I guess if it trains off of Ubisoft games, then whatever, whatever, but it's, it's all going to sound like a copy of something else.
7464400	7468000	Now, granted, some of you feel that video game quest text is already at that point.
7468640	7469920	Oh, oh, Rob.
7470160	7470720	What's that?
7471520	7477200	I'm sorry, this, I'm not meaning to set this off, but there's something that went back to a very earlier thing that we talked about.
7477240	7477760	Okay.
7478760	7485840	Um, on the homepage of Twitch now, I think this is, this is on the German page.
7485840	7489360	Anyway, there is a Luna link right at the top of the page.
7490400	7503760	They're, they have Luna at the bar on the top, but that's like, like throwing a link is literally the, the most minimal thing they could do.
7504400	7505560	You don't even notice it.
7506480	7506720	Yeah.
7506760	7510080	And actually, yes, that says quite a, quite enough right there.
7510480	7511360	You've never noticed it.
7511360	7512280	With that I don't go to the homepage.
7512320	7513600	I just go to my follower page.
7513600	7514080	Fair.
7515440	7516000	Interesting.
7516000	7518920	I do go to the homepage, but then I instantly click things on the left.
7518960	7521520	So I guess I never think to go to my followers page directly.
7522040	7522560	It's interesting.
7523040	7523400	Anyway.
7524400	7525560	Uh, all right, let's move on.
7525560	7526600	We still have a few more stories.
7526600	7527200	Dark Sakura.
7528280	7531760	Um, so Silent Hill 2 remake.
7532640	7535640	Um, it is near completion according to the Bloober team.
7536120	7544520	Um, they don't have a launch date yet, but they are revealing that it will be quote sooner rather than later.
7545120	7551840	Um, according to a Polish outlet called Bankier, um, they said the game is technically ready.
7551880	7555360	Um, but they're, it's not complete.
7555880	7557400	It's close to completion.
7557440	7563640	Um, and that the release schedule and promotional marketing is actually going out by Konami themselves.
7564280	7566280	Um, so that's out of their hands.
7566760	7572480	Um, but yeah, the, um, I'm pretty excited.
7572480	7577480	They also are saying that the nurse enemies are now have black stockings.
7578360	7586040	And according to, uh, Ito, the art director, um, it, it was because the original nurses exposed too much skin.
7586720	7586960	Hmm.
7587560	7596360	But, um, a lot of the fans are saying that this goes more with James Sunderland's, uh, psychosexual mental state.
7596760	7601640	So, but you can, you can already wishlist it on steam.
7601640	7602680	So I think that's pretty cool.
7602920	7603280	Yeah.
7603360	7615800	I wonder if, um, whatever is coming for E3, which by the way, not to get too much on a tangent, but I'm going to, cause I was ready to come on this show and be like, so Hey folks, we're like less than three months from E3.
7616040	7618600	Um, are what the fuck is happening?
7618800	7625440	Apparently E3 registration did open up at some point to like me and they are supposedly targeting podcasters.
7625800	7628720	I almost wanted to apply just for the lols.
7628760	7632800	Like I have no intention on going just because I don't have the time off to do it.
7633000	7634960	I mean, I do, but I don't.
7635360	7640400	Um, so it's, I almost want to apply for those, but, um, if one of you want to apply, go for it.
7640400	7640920	I don't care.
7640920	7641680	But, uh,
7642680	7645520	does that mean I have to do like another writing sample?
7645520	7647640	Jamie just said everything with her face.
7647640	7649600	No, the application is completely different now.
7649680	7651360	So they've, they've changed that.
7651360	7652760	So for better or for worse, we'll see.
7652760	7653200	When is it again?
7653840	7654800	Middle of June.
7656240	7657280	I know that's so descriptive.
7657280	7657800	I'm sorry.
7657840	7658600	Like maybe.
7658600	7663160	Well, no, no, because, um, I took the week off for my birthday.
7663720	7666560	Um, and then I'm going to TwitchCon.
7666600	7667160	So,
7667320	7667640	Oh yeah.
7667640	7670600	I was just saying, no, your birthday is way too early and TwitchCon is too late.
7670800	7672240	It's middle of June somewhere.
7672440	7673600	I'm not going to be able to swing it.
7674080	7678000	I would have done it just for shits and then going to, and then to go to Disneyland.
7678120	7678480	Yeah.
7678480	7686280	I got to admit, I'm still, I'm still a little bit tempted, but anyway, long story, but they, I have not seen E3 open up to general public.
7687560	7694640	Now, I guess I should go to the website cause I, I don't, I would hate to sit here and, you know, I, if I'm, if I'm going to be critical, I want to be accurate.
7694640	7695040	Okay.
7695440	7702400	So I guess I could look here live on air, but I don't think the, uh, general registration is still open.
7702520	7709000	I think industry and media and that whole thing is open, but not the general population is still not open.
7709280	7713880	But folks, it is less than three months from E3.
7714120	7720800	If you want to get a flight to Los Angeles, 90 days is the sweet spot to do it.
7720800	7724280	There it is.
7724320	7724520	Okay.
7724520	7724920	Thank you.
7724960	7725560	Thank you, Bobby.
7725560	7726360	I knew somebody in chat.
7726520	7727400	Not open yet.
7727400	7729840	Gamer registration page says coming soon.
7731440	7732320	Sure.
7733520	7734360	Is it though?
7734360	7735800	No shit about E3 anymore.
7735800	7736840	It is not relevant.
7737520	7738000	I know.
7738440	7739160	End of story.
7739200	7739520	I know.
7739520	7744040	But I just, when, when the press release finally comes out that says, oh, we had to cancel E3.
7744160	7746280	I just want to be able to say, mm hmm.
7747520	7750440	I wouldn't, I would go to see if I can get a Sega t-shirt.
7751280	7753720	And then go to Disneyland in my Sega t-shirt.
7753720	7756680	I would go to take sad selfies in front of the NFT booths.
7756720	7757760	That's what I would go for.
7758760	7762320	And, and maybe see what sort of vaporware we're looking at again.
7762320	7763360	I remember the Phantom.
7765160	7765520	All right.
7765520	7768000	You guys in chat are cracking me up.
7768240	7770800	SSU100Matt says the ball pit will be fantastic.
7771040	7772720	Fire Festival E3.
7774880	7775800	Make it deep enough.
7775800	7778840	I wonder if I, Rob, I wonder if I would run into Kojima again.
7779320	7779800	Like I did.
7779800	7780600	Why would he go?
7781080	7782040	Why would he go?
7783720	7784440	It's a joke.
7784440	7784680	It is.
7784680	7784920	It is.
7785080	7788000	Well, Konami may actually announce whatever June thing there is.
7788000	7794040	So in all seriousness, Summer Game Fest now, and announcements that come with that.
7794040	7797040	Maybe we'll see a Silent Hill 2 thing come out of that.
7797040	7798200	That could be very interesting.
7798440	7798760	So.
7798800	7808600	My three happy E3 memories ever was getting to chat through an interpreter with Koji Kondo and getting his autograph.
7809560	7815240	And partially getting to meet Akira Yamaoka.
7816200	7822360	And getting my picture taken with Igarashi and making him jump out of his skin when I asked him in Japanese, if I could.
7824280	7825080	You were there for that.
7825080	7825640	I was.
7825640	7826120	I was.
7826120	7826840	You took the picture.
7826840	7827200	I did.
7827640	7828040	Yeah.
7828680	7829920	Notice I wasn't in the picture.
7829920	7830320	I just didn't know.
7830320	7831320	With his hat.
7831880	7832760	That hat.
7833600	7836120	Meeting Igarashi was, was pretty cool.
7836120	7836840	He's a rock star.
7836840	7837120	Yeah.
7837760	7838640	All right, moving on.
7838640	7840880	Just a couple more stories and then we can wrap up.
7840880	7841520	So, Loki.
7842800	7843200	All right.
7843920	7845840	So I think we talked about this before.
7845840	7853280	The Unreal editor that's coming out for Fortnite that basically allows you to kind of make your own games and stuff out of it.
7853600	7854480	It's kind of like.
7855200	7856000	That was last week.
7856000	7856560	Yeah.
7856560	7856880	Yeah.
7856880	7859920	It's, it's kind of like Roblox, but not like Roblox.
7859920	7862720	It's more like, almost like Dreams a little bit.
7863280	7867920	But, um, people have already been making things out of it and it looks pretty fantastic.
7867920	7873920	And we have things, of course, recreating other games is something that has been a common theme.
7873920	7881840	So we have, uh, no World 1-1, but, you know, uh, Grove Street from Grand Theft Auto 5.
7881840	7891920	Um, you have people recreating Counter-Strike levels, Mario Kart tracks, um, the, uh, castle from, uh, Super Mario 64.
7891920	7893200	That type of stuff.
7893200	7899680	And even folks have brought in, um, the original map from Fortnite into Fortnite.
7901120	7903200	And you can actually play it too, which is pretty cool.
7903760	7910560	So yeah, I'm very excited to see what they do with this, but I'm not sure how the games are going to be presented in there.
7910560	7913680	How you can actually play all this stuff, but it sounds cool.
7914720	7914960	Yeah.
7916000	7921840	Uh, I, it's only been a week and I, but what cracked me up most about that story was somebody put the original Fortnite.
7921920	7924080	Fortnite map back in Fortnite, because of course they did.
7926240	7927120	I like the original.
7927680	7932080	Fortnite can't get away with changing those, but they will, of course, but it's just funny.
7932080	7937360	People are always going to miss the old shit and they'll, now they can use this to put it right back in there, which is funnier, funnier.
7937360	7938800	So, all right.
7939760	7946400	And lastly, tonight we have news on the next game from the creators of Genshin Impact, which is a game I tried to get into.
7946400	7947680	It didn't really land for me.
7948320	7949600	Maybe this one will, I don't know.
7949600	7952160	But it's a game called Honkai Star Rail.
7952160	7954160	It's going to be coming out on PC and mobile.
7954160	7957760	And they say a PlayStation version will be coming later for five and four.
7958400	7971520	This is now a space fantasy tactical RPG, and it's turn-based unlike Genshin Impact, which almost feels like kind of Breath of the Wild gone anime a little bit mixed with some traditional RPG elements.
7971520	7975840	But Honkai is going to be a turn-based RPG, which could be very interesting.
7976800	7980320	And there are trailers, but the trailers don't tell you shit.
7980320	7984000	They're just basically anime characters and all that stuff and trying to get you into it.
7985600	7999040	The story will follow a protagonist with a stellaron implant that is a mysterious life form that responds to the world's desire to advance on a quest to discover the truth about the, their words, cancer of all worlds.
8000000	8006960	The tutorial level is on Herta Space Station, and then you go to a snow planet, Jorilov 6, and other diverse world.
8006960	8008160	It is a free to play game.
8008160	8014560	And of course, that means they're going to use gacha mechanics, loot boxes, characters, items to monetize.
8016880	8018560	Do you go to diverse systems?
8020480	8020980	No.
8022800	8025040	So this is a free to play game.
8025040	8026720	It's going to be rated T for Teen.
8026720	8031040	It will be on PC, but it is exclusive to Epic Game Store on PC.
8031040	8036960	But it'll also be available on iOS and Android and then eventually a PlayStation version.
8036960	8039440	And that seemed to be when Genshin really took off.
8039440	8043440	So it'll be interesting to see that how this does at first, but we'll see.
8044000	8044500	So.
8045040	8045540	All right.
8046880	8049680	That's it for the stories we have on deck currently.
8049680	8053360	I did want to mention, it oddly didn't come up in the rest of the show.
8053360	8058960	But there were some big conventions going on this weekend, namely Game Developers Conference,
8058960	8064320	which some of these things, which funny enough, you know, that whole Counter-Strike 2 thing
8065040	8072960	that was timed at the exact same time as Epic's big thing at Game Developer Conference.
8074000	8074720	Coincidence?
8075840	8076480	I think not.
8076480	8077680	I think not.
8077680	8079920	But just something interesting to know.
8079920	8082080	But Game Developers Conference was this weekend, of course.
8082080	8086320	And so, you know, not that Game Developers Conference is a place where they do a lot
8086320	8089200	of announcements, but sometimes we get things out of it, right?
8089200	8092320	Like Sony has been known to show off things.
8092320	8095040	Like I want to say the move was there, you know, some time ago.
8095040	8099280	Sometimes it might be about more like peripherals and those sorts of things to like future
8099280	8101200	developments of these things.
8101200	8104320	But you usually don't get a lot of gaming news news out of GDC.
8104320	8106160	PAX East was also this weekend.
8107040	8112000	Again, not a place you get a ton of news usually, but there are oftentimes panels
8112240	8114400	that can even be put on by developers.
8115200	8119680	And so actually, I know there was a Final Fantasy XIV panel as well as a Final Fantasy
8119680	8122240	XVI panel because Yoshida was there.
8123680	8127440	But it didn't seem like there was a lot of new information out of those panels, except
8127440	8132880	apparently, you know, if you believe it, and I don't see why not, Yoshi P was playing
8132880	8136320	Final Fantasy XVI on a PlayStation 5 live.
8136320	8138960	Like they had the controller there and they were playing the game live.
8138960	8143440	So it's that close to being done, which for a June release, you would expect it needs
8143440	8145520	to be at that kind of state at this point.
8145520	8149600	It may not be like gold, but at real close, real close at this point.
8149600	8150720	So, yeah.
8150720	8157040	And DJ Rama S also points off a ton of other gaming adjacent, you know, nerdy conventions
8157040	8157920	and other places too.
8158640	8162480	WonderCon, ZenkaiaCon, GalaxyCon, all of those are this week.
8162480	8163760	I had a friend at WonderCon.
8163760	8164960	So it's, yeah, busy.
8164960	8169440	And I know the cast of, at least some of the cast of anime jam session was at ZenkaiaCon
8169440	8171440	because I saw DJ Rama's post.
8172080	8178400	So ZenkaiaCon, no ZenkaiaCon, ZenkaiaCon.
8178400	8179600	I keep adding an extra vowel.
8180240	8180740	All right.
8182080	8187040	So anyway, let's go to the listener roundtable.
8187040	8188720	We want to check in with some emails.
8188720	8192160	Participate at orangesontrated.com is the place to send some emails.
8192160	8196080	You can also join our discord server, vognetwork.com slash discord.
8196080	8202000	If you want to be able to call the show, we have a room that says green room and we'll
8202000	8202800	take calls there.
8202800	8204480	So let's get to the mailbag.
8204480	8206400	Participate at orangesontrated.com.
8207360	8208480	Too much crap on my desk.
8211760	8213280	So we do have an email.
8213280	8213780	Yay.
8214400	8214900	Uno.
8215920	8216420	If you're ready?
8217040	8217540	Yes.
8217540	8218640	Hello, LR.
8218640	8219760	So, hi, Y-Y-R.
8220400	8224480	You may already have mentioned this earlier in the show, but for the possible benefits
8224480	8227840	of the live listeners, I just want to iterate or reiterate one thing tonight.
8227840	8232800	March 26 could be your last opportunity to purchase games, DLC, and other items from
8232800	8235280	the Nintendo eShop, either on 3DS or Wii U.
8236000	8238160	Nintendo's own language is vague.
8238160	8243040	As of March 27th, 2023, it will no longer be possible to make purchases.
8243040	8248400	So as we don't know whether the shop is shutting down tonight at midnight Pacific time, tomorrow
8248400	8253200	morning, or at some other time tomorrow, it would be prudent to assume that tonight is
8253200	8253920	your last chance.
8254480	8258080	I was wondering if it was going to be on Tokyo time.
8258080	8262880	Anyway, while this is not the first digital store shut down on a major platform, it's
8262880	8265280	certainly the most significant to date.
8265280	8272400	We are not often lamenting the loss of DLC on the original Xbox or the loss of the PlayStation
8272400	8277440	mobile games on Vita, but here we are losing a significant portion of Nintendo's history,
8277440	8282080	spanning over 10 years and even more than that if you consider that this will mark the
8282080	8283840	end of Virtual Console.
8283840	8288800	Yes, it will no longer be possible to outright buy digital copies of Nintendo's classic games.
8288800	8293440	After tomorrow, you can only subscribe to them via Nintendo Switch online.
8293440	8299600	It is still possible to add funds to your 3DS and Wii U as long as you linked them to
8299600	8300960	your Nintendo account.
8300960	8305520	Just add funds either on your Switch or on Nintendo's website and they will instantly
8305520	8308320	appear on your linked 3DS and Wii U consoles.
8308320	8311200	It will also be possible to redownload content after the closures.
8311200	8312080	Don't worry about that.
8312640	8316320	Here is a partial list of things that will be disappearing tomorrow that you might not
8316320	8317520	have considered.
8317520	8322160	All of the games available via Street Pass Me Plaza, Street Pass itself will still work.
8322880	8327200	All of the DLC available for all of the Fire Emblem games released on 3DS.
8327200	8331920	This includes the entire final campaign of the Fire Emblem Fates, which is only otherwise
8331920	8336400	available on the physical special edition, which now goes for over $500 on eBay.
8337040	8341440	The Nintendo DS Virtual Console games available on Wii U, which will allow you to use your
8341440	8344240	TV as the top screen and the Wii U gamepad as the bottom screen.
8344960	8349760	All of the hundreds of available free demos, the ability to unlock minigames and Rusty's
8349760	8354320	real-deal baseball, as well as the ability to progress through the story of the game
8354320	8354800	itself.
8355360	8359920	The digital versions of Pokemon Red, Blue, Yellow, Gold, Silver, and Crystal, which will
8359920	8364880	allow you to transfer Pokemon forward into other 3DS games or the new Pokemon Home.
8366160	8370160	The Pokemon Bank app, which you'll need if you want to transfer anything forward from
8370160	8371920	any of the pre-switch Pokemon games.
8372480	8376960	The ridiculous love child of Derby Owners Club and Tri-Peak Solitaire that is Pocket
8376960	8377840	Card Jockey.
8377840	8380480	Trust me on this one, it's $6 well spent.
8382000	8387600	Just one more reminder that DLC in the Nintendo 3DS games is only available via the games
8387600	8388560	themselves.
8388560	8393920	In some cases, you'll need to progress beyond a certain point before the DLC becomes available.
8393920	8397920	For example, in New Super Mario Brothers 2, you need to finish World 1 before you can
8397920	8399520	buy the Coin Rush Course packs.
8400160	8404320	Good luck to everyone and try not to spend too much, and of course, enjoy your week.
8404320	8405600	I spent way too much money.
8405600	8406480	Aaron, YYR.
8407600	8409360	Well, thanks for the heads up, Aaron.
8409360	8411920	We did talk a little bit about this last week, but...
8412560	8413200	Oh, go ahead.
8413760	8417840	Well, I was just going to say what Mike said, Pocket Card Jockey is on Apple Arcade.
8418800	8419520	There was a little bit of...
8420400	8425920	YYR is talking with somebody in Discord about that and kind of giving his case for why
8427280	8431280	there may still be some reason to get the 3DS version even with the Apple Arcade version
8431280	8433440	out there, but that's really a preference thing at this point.
8433440	8437360	But I was going to point out, we did talk a little bit about this last week, but I know
8437360	8442160	YYR has been traveling because I saw where the gifts were coming from, YYR and Pokemon,
8443120	8445520	which I wish you'd let me know, but that's all right, that's all right.
8445840	8447680	It's freaking cute, by the way.
8447680	8448180	What's that?
8448880	8449760	The game is super cute, by the way.
8449760	8450560	Oh, yeah, it's cute.
8451600	8456080	But I did like in there that there were a lot of suggestions because we were asking for
8456080	8459600	those last week, and I had forgotten about things like Pocket Card Jockey and some of
8459600	8464080	those other things he kind of gets into there, so I like the recommendation list there.
8464080	8467680	I do want to say, with all that being said, there is a part of me, and I kind of referenced
8467680	8470880	this earlier in the show, there's a part of me that's like, you know what, at this point,
8470880	8474560	I don't want to reward Nintendo for what they're doing here, because you're right,
8475520	8478240	and I'm not policing anyone else's activity.
8478240	8479840	Y'all spend your money on what makes you happy.
8479840	8482560	I'm just going to be completely, bluntly, brutally honest.
8483440	8487280	If the store is closing at this point, and Nintendo is effectively done with support
8487280	8491040	for these systems, then I'm waiting for the next homebrew to come out to crack the shit
8491040	8493440	out of these things, because Nintendo probably won't patch it.
8493440	8494320	They might.
8494320	8495200	They still might.
8495200	8498880	I feel like they'll wake up their team enough to be able to do that, but I think we're
8498880	8502720	going to get some pretty solid homebrew stuff, and essentially, the piracy is going to be
8502800	8507840	wide open for this, and do I care at this point?
8507840	8511920	No, because Nintendo has literally taken the legitimate avenue away.
8513040	8518640	But let's also be honest, am I itching to get in there and play 3DS games and Wii U
8518640	8522560	games, especially with what else is going on this year?
8522560	8523120	Not really.
8524160	8529200	But I also understand, and I've openly admitted this on the show, I don't usually play a lot
8529200	8533200	of games on the go, and there are a lot of people that feel very differently about gaming
8533200	8536160	who love to play on the Switch, who love to play on the 3DS.
8536160	8536880	Cool.
8536880	8540080	So again, you've got to do what you've got to do.
8540080	8542720	For me, I don't want to give Nintendo any more money over this.
8543600	8547360	At this point, I'll turn to piracy if there's something, or emulation is probably what it'll
8547360	8549520	really be by the time I really want to get around to something.
8549520	8553280	I'll turn to emulation to look at playing some of these games from the past that I'd
8553280	8553760	like to do.
8555440	8558640	But we should also endorse the legitimate routes.
8558640	8560160	I realize it's a slippery slope.
8561280	8561760	There you go.
8562400	8563440	We have some calls.
8563440	8565520	Arguments by their nature are fallacious.
8567280	8569360	Let's get into the green room.
8569360	8572560	We have some calls waiting to get on air tonight, so let's get to it.
8572560	8575920	I'm going to start bringing some folks on, and let's bring our first caller on.
8575920	8578080	And hello, you are on Orange Launch Radio.
8578080	8578560	Who's this?
8579680	8587200	Hi, this is Fixation Gaze, a friend of Jamie's and a short time enjoyer of the VOG Network.
8587200	8588480	Well, hello, hello.
8588480	8590560	I recognize you from Team Eat.
8590560	8593600	I believe you all call yourselves over there on our channel.
8593600	8594160	Yes.
8594160	8596320	So welcome to Orange Launch Radio.
8597760	8600960	Our branded jackets are coming soon, but thank you for having me.
8603120	8606720	I've never done a call-in before, but one of the topics I wanted to bring up is something
8606720	8611440	that makes me especially happy recently is the Resident 4 remake.
8611440	8614960	Yes, a friend of mine was playing this, and I was watching him play this.
8614960	8616160	It looks so good.
8616160	8617280	Yes, please elaborate.
8617280	8617600	Yeah, yeah.
8618560	8624800	Okay, so I'm going to preface this with Resident Evil is a long time hyper fixation of mine.
8624800	8632000	So seeing the remake has been almost like kind of a sacrilegious kind of experience because
8632000	8635680	it's like they keep some of the things that make it so integral and so good, but then
8635680	8637040	they also add things.
8637040	8641280	And at first it's like, oh gosh, change is scary, which is normal for people who are
8641280	8645840	hardcore fans, but then they turn it into something like absolutely excellent.
8646560	8651440	Um, such as one of the biggest things that they changed that a lot of people won't really
8651440	8656320	see when they just play through the game normally is when you break boxes now, instead of like
8656320	8658720	taking out your knife, now Leon does a little kick.
8659280	8664080	And that's something you wouldn't notice with a normal gameplay, but with, but with, you
8664080	8669200	know, like compare and contrast exactly back to the old games, the one of the biggest things
8669200	8673760	that some people didn't like was how it was slow to take out your knife and hit boxes.
8673840	8676800	And now it's sped up in a way that's believable.
8676800	8682640	So it was terrifying to see like a new aspect of something I care very deeply about, but
8682640	8687920	they they've treaded that ground with such care and respect that it is.
8687920	8692320	I really applaud Capcom on this, but I also do have to bring up the, uh, a lot of people
8692320	8697680	have been talking about how it glitches and how it's causing computer crash crashes and
8697680	8699760	not working as well as it should.
8701280	8702560	And that is something to bring up.
8704000	8707680	Hopefully it's something they can kind of address with patches, which I know we all
8707680	8711120	hate that this is where the industry is at, but the reality is this is where the industry
8711120	8711840	is at.
8711840	8716560	And I tend to cut these companies a little more slack when it comes to PC gaming, because
8716560	8719200	reality is every PC configuration is different.
8719200	8721440	So it is kind of hard to test every configuration.
8721440	8726400	So I do, I cut a little more slack on PC based issues because it can be hard to find those
8726400	8726960	things.
8726960	8730240	So at least there's that potential to patch that stuff later on.
8730240	8732400	And hopefully Capcom stays on top of that.
8732400	8733200	I think they will.
8733200	8735920	Their track record kind of shows they're pretty good about the patching and they can
8735920	8737280	get some of those issues fixed.
8737280	8744000	But considering what a legendary game Resident Evil 4 is, I mean, there's many, many people
8744000	8747920	that consider that that is the best GameCube game, period.
8748880	8751120	And maybe even other platforms too.
8752720	8757760	The fact that this is a bit of an upgrade when not everything lately in the remaster
8757760	8759200	department has been an upgrade.
8759200	8762720	The Secret of Mana remake kind of had some bad issues with it.
8762720	8766400	Trials of Mana came out a little better and I think maybe redeemed things, but Secret
8766400	8767920	of Mana really should have been better than it was.
8768480	8770400	Chrono Cross, we were talking about that.
8770400	8774640	Finally, a year after the fact, Radical Dreamers Edition gets a patch to fix it.
8774640	8776160	But the remaster, eh.
8776160	8781920	So it's nice to hear that Capcom is kind of getting a lot of Ws in these Resident Evil
8782480	8785680	because I know the earlier remasters were pretty well received too, but this was the
8785680	8789760	one people were really waiting for because it's like, don't screw up 4.
8789760	8790800	Don't screw up 4.
8791360	8798160	Yeah, because of how dense of a game 4 really is and how much it draws from and takes inspiration
8798160	8803760	because we're dealing with a virus that takes control of people's minds via parasites and
8803760	8807360	we're dealing with politics and we're dealing with giants and fish monsters.
8807360	8811680	There is so much in this game that is extremely easy to get it wrong.
8811680	8812720	It really is.
8812720	8818240	So the fact that they've taken it with grace and it feels good to go through the game.
8818240	8819760	It doesn't feel like any of it's rushed.
8819760	8821200	It feels like it's open enough.
8821920	8823040	There's a lot of double backing.
8823040	8826160	They've added new little side quests, which are a lot of fun.
8827360	8832560	But I feel like they've taken Resident Evil 4 and I think they did it really well.
8832560	8836400	They've of course removed some of the original funny lines, but they've kept a lot of what
8836400	8841520	makes Leon Leon at this phase in what is quote unquote his life, because of course this is
8841520	8842480	a game character.
8842480	8845360	But they've stayed true to what he was in Resident Evil 4.
8846000	8849920	And so far from what I've seen, I haven't played through the whole game, mind you.
8849920	8852960	They have stayed true to what Ashley is.
8852960	8859280	And that was another big thing about Resident Evil 4 originally was how fucking annoying
8859280	8859840	she was.
8861040	8866240	But it seems like they've toned her down, but also staying to her personality.
8866240	8871760	And that is something that's very important to me for the validity of it being a remaster.
8872080	8875520	And sometimes these remakes really do redeem certain characters.
8875520	8878560	I think back to the Final Fantasy 7 remake and Aerith.
8878560	8883040	And I think Jamie, I remember even you saying, you know, she doesn't bother me in the remake
8883040	8884800	as much as she did in the original.
8884800	8887280	But her fucking annoying as she was.
8890720	8892960	And the voice actors did a tremendous job as well.
8892960	8894080	Should be committed for that.
8894080	8894800	Absolutely.
8895600	8898960	I still don't have my save file so I can fight Jenova and then watch her die.
8899840	8902640	Let me ask you this, because I know we want to get to another call before we wrap up the
8902640	8906640	show, but I want to ask you this as someone who's a self-described Resident Evil fan.
8906640	8910240	You know, do you hope that they keep going with these remakes?
8910240	8911760	Do you want to see an RE5?
8911760	8915360	I know 5 and 6 weren't quite as well received in the bigger picture.
8915360	8917520	Do you want them to try again with those games?
8917520	8919520	Or where do you kind of hope these remakes go?
8919520	8923120	Or are you like, stop here, quit when you're ahead, stop here, don't do any more.
8924240	8928320	So this might be a controversial take because I speak on behalf of me, but not really like
8928320	8932640	Resident Evil fans as a whole, because we're kind of divided on some things.
8932640	8937760	But honestly, with the resources they have now and the ideas and how they've seen things
8937760	8943120	turn out, I think they should give it another shot, rework some of those games and release
8943120	8944800	them to be better.
8944800	8950880	I think they should absolutely go through with remaking the whole original series before
8950880	8956000	the new arc, which is the Ethan Winters arc that comes in 7 and 8.
8956000	8957440	But I think they should.
8957440	8960640	Because they really tried to bite more than they could chew when they made those games
8960640	8961280	originally.
8961920	8963360	And they should do it.
8963360	8964080	I think they should.
8964080	8967040	They should put their money where their mouth is and do it all.
8967040	8970160	Well, you have at least one person in chat agreeing with you because Shane says they
8970160	8971120	better remake 6.
8972960	8974000	Absolutely.
8974000	8974720	Absolutely.
8976160	8978000	Fixie, real quick before we let you go.
8978000	8983360	I know you're in the process of trying to grow your own.
8983360	8985120	Is that a nickname you prefer?
8985120	8987120	I'm only calling you that because Jamie calls you that.
8987520	8987840	Fine.
8987840	8988400	You're fine.
8988400	8993360	I've gotten a lot of variations on my username, and I think Fixie is my favorite so far.
8993360	8993860	Okay, okay.
8994400	8997280	So I know you're trying to grow your own Twitch channel.
8997280	9000480	I gave you a shout out on our channel, but do you want to quickly just kind of plug your
9000480	9003520	channel and what folks can expect over on your Twitch channel?
9004640	9005360	Oh, sure.
9005360	9006160	Absolutely.
9006160	9010720	Well, so my channel and my Twitch is what I primarily do is I play a lot of Dead by
9010720	9016720	Daylight, but I'm hoping as I upgrade my hardware and I stick to a schedule that I go into more
9016720	9022640	of the horror demographic because I used to be a balloon streamer and that is very much
9022640	9025040	anti everything horror.
9025040	9025920	It is very soft.
9025920	9029920	It's very noise is just like soft, repetitive noises.
9030480	9038080	But my next big goal is to play the entirety of the Outlast series and then want to start
9038080	9040320	and do the entire Resident Evil series.
9041040	9045680	Well, somebody, I'm going to tell you this, you won't catch me ever doing a play through
9045680	9048080	of Outlast, so you are braver than I.
9049280	9057840	I had a hyper fixation on Outlast Whistleblower, which is by far to me one of the most horrific
9057840	9059760	DLCs that has ever been made.
9060720	9061440	Oh, my gosh.
9063360	9067920	No, that was the game Amnesia I was thinking of where I saw this YouTube where somebody
9067920	9071760	I think it was the sequel Amnesia where somebody started it and literally within five seconds
9071840	9077200	they go, nope, and they close the game because it scared the shit out of them.
9077200	9082160	The first time I ever played Outlast, I had to keep the lights on in the room.
9082160	9085840	And I remember I was playing with friends because we had decided if one of us gets too
9085840	9088400	scared, another person will hop on and continue.
9088400	9091120	And they kept turning the lights off for quote unquote atmosphere.
9091120	9095840	And I said, I swear to God, if you do not turn that light on right now, I am not playing
9095840	9096480	this.
9096480	9101920	But now that I've gotten to be more of a horror buff and a lot more acclimated to screaming
9101920	9106480	due to Dead by Daylight and the jump scares that happen in a multiplayer game, I think
9106480	9110560	I'm ready to do it by myself with the lights off, with the lights off.
9110560	9111360	Oh, my gosh.
9111360	9112080	No, no.
9112080	9117200	I remember when I played Silent Hill Homecoming for the first time, I was playing it on Xbox
9117200	9119040	at home in the middle of a rainstorm.
9119040	9121680	And I was playing with the lights off, which is fine, whatever.
9122400	9128080	But as I was playing the game and they get to a scary scene, the rain and wind blew the
9128080	9130880	front door open because I guess I forgot to lock it.
9130880	9134160	And that's when I said, nope, nope, nope.
9134160	9139280	I closed the door, immediately powered off the Xbox, went into my room and totally did
9139280	9140400	the blanket burrito.
9140400	9143040	Or I said, this is where I live now.
9143040	9144720	I moved into a blanket.
9144720	9151280	I started actually being scared of Call of Duty zombies.
9152160	9158560	And now I've yeah, I used to be terrified of everything scary, but now now I fully immerse
9158560	9160320	myself into the scary culture.
9160320	9165440	I read scary stories in my old house with no lights on in the hallways, and I keep my
9165440	9166720	door open and I go to sleep.
9167600	9171200	I have fully tamed it out of me and I'm going to do some scary stuff.
9171200	9175520	So you guys should totally check me out on my Twitch channel if you like scary things.
9176240	9176800	All right.
9176800	9178640	Well, and Fixie and I co-stream.
9179440	9182240	Yeah, I saw you streaming the other night and you both were.
9182240	9183040	Yeah, I saw that.
9183040	9183680	So.
9183680	9184080	All right.
9184080	9186640	Well, Fixie, best of luck with the growth of your own channel.
9186640	9189120	I'm going to let you go so we can get another call in here before we end tonight.
9189120	9192000	But thanks so much for calling and good luck with the games and your channel growth.
9192000	9193360	Thank you so much for having me.
9193360	9193920	You're welcome.
9193920	9194320	Anytime.
9194320	9194800	Take care.
9196480	9196880	All right.
9196880	9200560	Fixie and I need to have like a watch party where we watch Midsommar.
9201120	9202320	Oh, my gosh.
9202320	9207280	Is Midsommar on the Amazon service or whatever?
9208160	9209840	I don't I don't know.
9210640	9212800	I have it on my Apple TV.
9212800	9213680	Oh, it's on Prime.
9213680	9214160	Cool, cool.
9214160	9215360	I love that movie.
9216000	9217520	I love like the full version of it.
9218400	9219760	We got to go to one more call here.
9219760	9221280	I definitely want to hear from this individual as well.
9221280	9224160	We haven't heard from in a little while, so let's bring them on the air.
9224160	9225680	Hi, you are on Orange Launch Radio.
9225680	9226160	Who's this?
9227200	9228800	Hello, it's Sturlock.
9228800	9229600	Hey, Sturlock.
9229600	9231360	Thanks for being patient while we took another call.
9231360	9232080	How are you tonight?
9232880	9233760	I'm pretty good.
9234640	9244400	Uh, so it's not my main topic, but I wanted to add an addendum to YYR's email.
9244400	9245840	Please, because it's now or never.
9246480	9247600	Yeah, um.
9249600	9259280	If you're in the US, you're extra screwed because one of the best rhythm games is going
9259280	9264240	away and impossible to buy in the US, and that is Rhythm Heaven Megamix.
9264240	9269120	Yeah, released physically everywhere else but the US, so that's fun.
9269760	9272160	Yeah, a lot of people lamenting the loss of that one.
9272160	9274480	I know that's come up in our Discord several times.
9274480	9275920	Yep, great game.
9275920	9278320	One of the best one of the best rhythm games ever made.
9278320	9283520	I really, really, really hope Rhythm Heaven gets a Switch game, even if it's just a re-release
9283520	9285360	of Megamix, I would be happy.
9285680	9290640	Well, you'll be happy to know Bobby Blackwolf says that's the game that he bought on his
9290640	9291520	3DS this week.
9292080	9292560	Oh, good.
9294560	9295680	It was a great game.
9295680	9296880	So what else is on your mind tonight?
9297680	9301760	But the main thing I wanted to talk about was Diablo 4.
9302320	9308080	I was hoping this might be the case because we were talking on, not Twitter, the other
9308080	9311680	one, Mastodon a little bit about this.
9312640	9318400	How have you been enjoying the, and for those that have never heard you on the show before,
9318400	9323280	you are blind and you love the hell out of games.
9323280	9327120	So you oftentimes kind of enlighten us on the accessibility.
9327120	9330480	And actually I know, and I gave you a shout out in chat as well, because I know on your
9330480	9336720	Twitch channel, I've learned a lot from watching you play games like The Last of Us, like how
9336720	9339680	accessibility settings, like how they help.
9339680	9343360	It's one thing to know, like what's there, what's all available, but being able to see
9343360	9347920	you use these things, like as you're playing the game really helps me understand how they
9347920	9348560	really help.
9348560	9351920	So I'm actually, so anyway, sorry, but just to set that up for people who may not know
9351920	9352320	you.
9352320	9354240	I'm really curious about this afternoon.
9354240	9355120	Yeah, just afternoon.
9355120	9360480	I was playing Hades with some accessibility mods that that game has.
9361280	9362720	Hades is fantastic.
9362720	9365840	Even without accessibility mods, it's still pretty playable.
9366480	9374320	The mods just add some nice, you know, quality of life things specifically for blind people
9374320	9377600	and take a lot of the guesswork out of doing some things.
9378560	9381120	So what's your take on Diablo 4?
9381120	9382960	Diablo 4 is fantastic.
9384480	9387360	What about it gets you happy and excited?
9387360	9396000	Well, for one, text to speech menus, fantastic.
9398240	9407280	It's a little buggy currently in certain spots like the options menu, but I have full faith
9407280	9413600	that that's stuff that's going to be fixed, you know, on launch release.
9413600	9414160	Mm hmm.
9415760	9416960	And they're taking feedback.
9416960	9421120	So it's, you know, they're going to be well aware of this stuff.
9424720	9435200	The other thing I would say is I do wish we had some sort of nav assist a la Last of Us
9435920	9439600	because this is a much, much bigger world than Diablo 3.
9439600	9440160	Mm hmm.
9443200	9445680	But I mean, games, it's not even out yet.
9445680	9449520	I I think we'll we will get something.
9449520	9453920	I don't know what form that's going to take, but I think I think we we will get some sort
9453920	9456880	of, you know, assistance as far as that's concerned.
9457680	9465920	But the other big, big positive is that since we have text to speech, we can manage our
9465920	9474720	own gear, gear, you know, names of items and what they do, what their stats at all reads
9474720	9475200	for us.
9476400	9483440	And as a Diablo 3 player that, you know, blind people can't manage their gear, that's like
9483440	9490560	the really the one thing that you absolutely positively need a sighted person to do for
9490560	9492720	you is gear management.
9492720	9495280	And we don't need that anymore.
9495280	9496320	And it's fantastic.
9500320	9504400	Like audio feedback's gotten a lot better because I've noticed on certain operating
9504400	9507440	systems that voiceover is a lot better than it was.
9507440	9507940	Yeah.
9510400	9518000	Yeah, for whatever reason, the on PS4 PS5, it's not as robust.
9518000	9525840	And I think that just has to do with maybe it's a slightly older build, but I I think
9525840	9529920	it's going to have parity at launch.
9529920	9531360	I don't think that's going to be an issue.
9531360	9531860	Yeah.
9532720	9540080	But the other the other really amazing thing that they did for us specifically is you have
9540080	9550320	to turn it on the options menu, but items and gold, you know, loot essentially has background
9550320	9550820	ambience.
9552000	9554400	So you can tell when things are on the ground.
9554400	9559280	Yes, I've noticed that it's a version of that is on by default for legendaries.
9560320	9562320	Oh, that's it's on by default for legendary.
9562320	9565520	Yeah, because I hear like a shimmer type of noise when you're sending your legendary.
9565520	9566020	Yeah.
9566320	9566720	Yeah.
9566720	9572240	And the rarity to the different rarities have different sounds associated with them.
9572240	9573280	It's like, oh, that's just a common.
9573280	9574720	I can ignore that, like whatever.
9576720	9578960	And you can break it down, too, if you want.
9578960	9584720	Like, so if you don't care about like, oh, just ignore all the commons, you can absolutely
9584720	9585220	do that.
9586080	9587280	You can even break it down.
9588080	9594320	I only care about weapons or only care about like chess pieces or whatever.
9594880	9596000	You can absolutely do that.
9597360	9602080	The amount of control you have over it is pretty awesome.
9603120	9606640	Do you think I remember one of the last times you called in and granted it was a little
9606640	9611840	while ago now, but I remember we were kind of mourning the loss of Hearthstone, you know,
9611840	9614880	had an add on that was really helping folks.
9614880	9619520	And you were really hoping that Blizzard would kind of take up things with that to help the
9619520	9621200	community be able to play Hearthstone.
9621920	9630240	Do you feel like Blizzard now is being receptive to feedback from the community and these sorts
9630240	9630740	of things?
9631360	9632400	Absolutely.
9632400	9635840	There was actually an update to that whole situation.
9635840	9643040	I don't know if you reported on it, but Blizzard themselves have come out and said that because
9643040	9659200	of the outcry and the support for Hearthstone, that they are looking into adding in native
9659200	9662960	accessibility for Hearthstone themselves.
9662960	9663460	That's great.
9666400	9672080	The other really cool thing is that we didn't actually lose access to Hearthstone for all
9672080	9679600	that long because the Hearthstone access patch slash mod, whatever you want to call
9679600	9684880	it, has basically become a community driven project.
9685840	9690720	I thought that part, I think I do remember hearing about that the community kind of took
9690720	9691760	over maintenance of that.
9691760	9696080	And I've heard that happen in some other cases before, but that's great to be able to keep
9696080	9696640	that going.
9696640	9700560	But that's really awesome that Blizzard is, you know, listening to that sort of feedback
9700560	9706560	and really making these types of meaningful implementations that you can really feel in
9706560	9708560	a game like Diablo 4 when you're playing it.
9709760	9711120	And that's great.
9712160	9716240	Oh, and another thing to add to Hearthstone, which makes me think that they're taking
9716240	9723520	this pretty seriously, is somebody looked into, I guess there were some patch notes
9723520	9727680	or a roadmap update for Unity accessibility.
9728000	9730400	And they called out Blizzard specifically by name.
9730400	9738000	There is a patch note that talks about text to speech or like control elements or something
9738000	9746000	to that effect specifically for Blizzard or for use of Blizzard games.
9746000	9748560	Like they went out of their way to call them out by name.
9748560	9755600	So I think we could actually have accessible mobile Hearthstone, which would be pretty
9756240	9758000	epic, actually.
9758720	9760800	Well, fingers and toes crossed they can get there.
9760800	9770400	I really do feel like Blizzard is taking accessibility extremely seriously.
9771280	9778160	And actually, one of my friends, super blind man, is in the Hearthstone creator program
9778160	9778560	now.
9778560	9780960	So that's awesome.
9781840	9782720	It's really awesome.
9783600	9792560	Controversies aside, there are people at Blizzard that do very good things.
9792560	9792800	Right.
9792800	9795600	And we have to call out the problems when the problems come up.
9795600	9801440	But we can also acknowledge like, hey, this company took feedback and made meaningful
9801440	9804080	changes as a result of that feedback.
9804080	9805200	Let's applaud that.
9805200	9808480	And I think that's why I'm thankful you called in tonight to talk about how far the
9808480	9810320	accessibility has come in Diablo 4.
9810320	9812400	Is it completely there yet?
9812400	9812880	No.
9812880	9814720	But are we moving in a meaningful direction?
9814720	9815040	Sure.
9815040	9815760	Sounds like it.
9815760	9817520	It's a huge step in the direction.
9817520	9821760	I had fairly low expectations.
9821760	9825680	I figured we'd get maybe one or two things.
9825680	9829360	But the amount, the framework that's already here is really impressive.
9829360	9831680	And I can't wait to see what else they do with it.
9831680	9831920	All right.
9831920	9833840	Well, Sturlock, I have to let you go so we can wrap up the show.
9833840	9835120	But thank you so much for the call.
9835120	9836640	And I give you a shout out in chat.
9836640	9841920	I hope folks will consider following along and really getting your perspective on games,
9842000	9844000	because I think it's really enlightening.
9844000	9848240	So as we continue this conversation about accessibility on into the future.
9848240	9848480	All right.
9848480	9849040	Yeah, definitely.
9849040	9849920	Have a good one, Sturlock.
9849920	9853440	And I look forward to running Diablo 4 stuff with you in the future.
9853440	9854080	Yeah, definitely.
9854080	9855120	Good to hear from you again.
9855120	9855760	Yeah.
9855760	9856240	Take care.
9856240	9856960	Good to be here.
9856960	9857440	All right.
9857440	9857760	See you.
9857760	9858000	Bye.
9858800	9859760	All right.
9859760	9862880	We had some good calls tonight, but it is getting a little late.
9862880	9866880	So I want to make sure we wrap up the show and have it all done before it's midnight
9866880	9867520	on the East Coast.
9867520	9869600	But to do that, I want to check in real quick.
9869600	9872960	Just quickly check in our eight last minute stories would address Loki.
9872960	9873440	Oh, yeah.
9873440	9874240	Two things real quick.
9874240	9880240	So first is Microsoft is ending their one dollar Xbox Game Pass offer that they've had
9880240	9881360	for a long time.
9881360	9883280	I didn't even know that was still a thing.
9884400	9887840	So, yes, unfortunately, they are getting rid of that now.
9888880	9892240	Instead, they're saying that anyone signed up for Game Pass said.
9893120	9900320	Um, we'll see months from existing subscriptions converted into partial months on a sharing
9900320	9900640	plan.
9900640	9904400	If you're currently signed up for Xbox Game Pass ultimate, the remaining months will turn
9904400	9909600	into 18 days of games past friends and family or something like that when they're talking
9909600	9913760	about like the successor game past friends and family, I guess.
9915760	9920960	But yeah, they're going to have different promotions as well to basically fill the void,
9920960	9921360	I guess.
9921360	9924400	But I mean, it wasn't always going to be one dollar forever.
9925120	9933200	Another thing I did want to mention, though, is I saw I was asked by the guy that runs
9933200	9933840	Nest Maker.
9933840	9937760	So he has a collection that he's been putting together.
9937760	9944640	So in partnership with the Strong Museum of Play, they have a collection of games.
9944640	9945680	Basically, it's in New York.
9945680	9946560	It's a museum.
9946560	9948720	You can go there and play video games.
9948720	9950640	They do archival stuff as well.
9950640	9955680	So I get to, along with some of the other Nest Maker people, put my game available to
9955680	9956720	play there as well.
9956720	9962560	So my game will be part of the Strong Museum collection 2023, which I am.
9962560	9966560	Loki, are you saying that they put you in a museum?
9966560	9967920	They put me in a museum.
9967920	9971280	Yeah, I think I think they're probably accessing the website.
9971280	9975680	But yes, in a roundabout way, it will be in a museum.
9977440	9979440	Loki, it doesn't get much better than that.
9980320	9985040	That's a hell of a thing to have on your resume of what you've accomplished in this life.
9985040	9986720	Congrats to the fucking Lations.
9986720	9988720	They were showing, well, they had...
9988720	9990800	I agree with necessary 100 Matt.
9990800	9992560	Somebody buried the fucking lead tonight.
9992560	9994800	You're going to talk about this in your gaming week.
9994800	9995760	This is big news.
9996800	9998400	I just thought about it at the last second.
9998400	10003840	But they had a Nest Maker panel also at PAX East, which I'd be curious to see how that
10003840	10004320	went.
10004320	10005200	Well, I hope it's on YouTube.
10005840	10007040	Yeah, I hope so.
10007040	10007920	I'd like to watch that.
10007920	10009120	But yeah, it'd be fun.
10009120	10010960	At least you'll be able to play the demo of the game.
10010960	10012880	I don't think I didn't put the full game on there.
10013600	10018960	Honestly, I would have made the full game available in the museum only, but there wasn't
10018960	10020160	really a way to do that.
10020160	10022480	But you have a demo version you can play at least.
10022480	10023040	Yeah.
10023040	10024000	Well, that's great.
10024000	10025040	Congratulations on that.
10025040	10025680	That's awesome.
10026400	10027040	All right.
10027040	10028480	But again, way to bury the lead.
10028480	10031840	All right, let's go around.
10031840	10033920	Let me quickly thank everybody for listening tonight.
10033920	10036640	Thank you for tuning in to Orange Launch Radio and supporting this show.
10036640	10040000	If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Launch Radio, please tell a friend or an AI
10040000	10041280	chat bot about the show.
10041280	10044320	Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we
10044320	10045840	need more voices.
10045840	10047440	Real humans only, please.
10047440	10054880	To put out on air to chat with cats and dogs are acceptable, too, but mostly people and
10054880	10055120	other.
10056080	10058800	Then the bird fans going to email and be like, you left out bird.
10058800	10059920	Okay, look, you know what I mean?
10061040	10062320	Thank you so much for supporting.
10062320	10064240	Tell a friend or two about the show.
10064240	10065120	Help us spread the word.
10066080	10070800	You know, a nice five star review on a site like iTunes, Spotify, wherever it is you found
10070800	10071520	this show.
10071520	10072800	That goes a long way.
10072800	10074800	So we really appreciate all of that.
10075760	10076320	That's that.
10076320	10078160	Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.
10078160	10084000	Dark Sakura, I'm sure we're going to see you swiffing and whatever we say there.
10085120	10086160	Swiffing and sliding.
10086160	10086660	Yeah.
10088080	10089840	Fixie and I will be co-streaming.
10089840	10090340	Oh, fun.
10091060	10096900	And I think we're going to have Shayla tonight and I have messaged Gwen.
10096900	10099780	So team Yeet will be eating around.
10099780	10101460	Maybe we'll actually do a yeet match.
10102580	10105140	But yeah, and if I may make a mention of something else.
10105140	10107700	Yeah, I'm having a subathon on my birthday.
10108660	10112580	That's April 19th, starting at 10 a.m. Pacific time.
10112580	10118020	And I'm going to try to go the full 24 hours because I'm brave and stupid.
10118740	10126420	And if I can hit a total of 250 subs in my channel, I will bleach my hair on stream.
10126420	10127620	Oh, that's a big goal.
10127620	10130100	But that's on stream.
10130100	10131220	That's a fun reward.
10131220	10134500	So and then I will promptly re-dye it red.
10136180	10137460	No, we'll see what happens.
10137460	10142260	Maybe for additional ones, I'll add in another color.
10143540	10143860	All right.
10143860	10144660	We'll see what happens.
10144660	10147140	No, I'm actually I've got full on platinum.
10149780	10152740	Nutrisse brand and I have Olaplex.
10152740	10154980	I have the stuff to do it and do it safely.
10154980	10160340	So if I get hot roots, that's just more incentive to re-dye it.
10160340	10160980	We'll see what happens.
10160980	10163220	I doubt I'm going to get it, but who knows?
10163220	10164020	You never know.
10164020	10165380	Got to be ready for it.
10165380	10168580	And I might play nurse if I get 150.
10168580	10169460	All right.
10169460	10169780	All right.
10169780	10170820	Well, have a good stream tonight.
10170820	10171320	We'll see you.
10171940	10172340	Thank you.
10172340	10172820	Bye.
10172820	10173320	Bye.
10173720	10174280	All right.
10174280	10175400	Loki, that means it's over to you.
10175400	10177080	What's your final thought for tonight?
10177080	10182080	A new episode should be out this week featuring Axolotl
10182080	10183800	women's area.
10183800	10185320	It's pretty amazing.
10185320	10186760	Can't wait for you to see it.
10186760	10187260	All right.
10188840	10192040	I haven't been streaming a lot this week because of all
10192040	10194280	the cat drama I talked about earlier in the show.
10194280	10198760	And now my husband's in Twitch jail, but I should be streaming
10198760	10200840	on my personal channel at some point this week.
10200840	10203320	I actually don't terribly know what I'm going to play next.
10203320	10206520	I've been toying with the idea of going back to the older
10206520	10207240	Pokemon game.
10207240	10210040	Well, not that old, but the Pokemon games I never finished,
10210040	10212040	especially now that home integration is included.
10212040	10215240	I kind of am itching to go back and play Pokemon Arceus.
10216440	10218120	I don't know if y'all in chat would be interested in that,
10218120	10218840	but give me a shout.
10218840	10220920	If you want me to check out Pokemon Arceus.
10221720	10225320	I'm also at some point I'll pick up Pokemon Scarlet as well,
10225320	10227800	but I'm just for some reason I'm really itching on Arceus.
10227800	10228360	I don't know why.
10228360	10229000	Like that one.
10229000	10230680	I'm like, why didn't I finish that game?
10231240	10235000	But now that the home integration is there too, I love
10235000	10237480	doing the little mini collection quests and building my
10237480	10240280	ultimate Pokemon collection and home.
10240280	10241720	I'm kind of down for that.
10241720	10242120	So all right.
10242120	10243480	Well, thank you for all the kind love in chat.
10243480	10244920	Maybe that is something I will do.
10244920	10248280	I got to do something to hold me over until June when Diablo
10248280	10251000	Fantasy 16, all this stuff comes out.
10251000	10253400	So yeah, get some games to hold us over.
10253400	10253900	All right.
10254760	10257800	Thank you again, everyone, for supporting Orange Mountains
10257800	10258840	Radio and our podcast.
10258840	10260280	We really appreciate you all.
10260280	10262600	953 weeks and counting.
10262600	10264760	And I can't wait to see you all in seven days.
10264760	10265400	We'll do it again.
10265400	10266680	Have a great week, everyone.
10266680	10267180	Good night.
10290280	10293400	They reflect those of the staff of Orange Lounge Radio nor
10293400	10296200	Fog Network, but you know, they were all still.
10320280	10325280	Bye.
