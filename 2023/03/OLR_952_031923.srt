1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,800
Can it be the year of Silent Hill? I'd really like it to be. Akira Yamaoka is back

2
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:18,140
with the series, a new movie, a remake, an interactive media experience and two new games

3
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:22,280
in the works? If it all goes bust, break out your PS2s, your PS4 that gives you anxiety

4
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:25,320
because it still has PT on it and any other version of the series you liked because the

5
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,400
second hand market is good. While we party like it's 1999, now it's time for your

6
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,680
hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers and Loki to tell you about one of these things and

7
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:35,760
the rest of the week's gaming news starting right now on the show where every gamer has

8
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:36,760
a voice.

9
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:45,240
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

10
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:51,880
where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are live once again with

11
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:59,920
the 952nd episode of our show for tonight, March the 19th of 2023. I hope those of you

12
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:04,520
that celebrated or did whatever for St. Patrick's Day had a good time. Everyone else, I hope

13
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:08,120
you had a good weekend and here we are on Sunday night to wrap it all up and put a little

14
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:12,640
bow on our gaming weeks and our gaming weekends and everything that's been going on in the

15
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,560
gaming industry. I am Rob Roberts and I am joined as always by the one and only Dark

16
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:25,160
Sakura or Jamie Summers up. Hi, how are you doing? I'm all right. I am. I'm a little sore

17
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:31,400
today because I have been got the I got the okay to get back into doing workouts. And

18
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:38,600
I started back on my hip workouts to strengthen my hip back up. I've said before I've got

19
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:43,640
premature arthritis in my right hip and just trying to build the muscle around it and stay

20
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:50,940
in good shape and prep for a potential Disneyland trip for my birthday. I'll be fine. So if

21
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:54,680
you're working out does this mean how long until we get a flex redeem on Dark Sakura's

22
00:01:54,680 --> 00:02:01,840
O.L.R.? Oh, a free one on the house here at Vogue Network, where we do tape live every

23
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,360
Sunday night at nine o'clock Eastern, six o'clock Pacific right after the Bobby Black

24
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:10,580
Wolf show. And if you want to see some of the gun show, we try to keep it minimal on

25
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:16,340
the visual antics because it is a podcast. It's been a podcast for 21 years about give

26
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:21,980
or take. And so we try to keep the visuals minimum. But who am I to say no to a free

27
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:29,140
flex redeem for Dark Sakura O.L.R.? I actually am considering putting up my own flex redeem

28
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:37,820
soon. Once I'm back to where I was lifting before, it's slow going. I stopped for about

29
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:44,240
seven months while I was so sick. So I've had to downgrade my weights instead of starting

30
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:49,820
off with 15s. I'm starting off well, I mean, technically I have a little bar on there,

31
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:55,080
so I'm actually starting off with 10 and then going to work myself back up to my 15s. And

32
00:02:55,080 --> 00:03:01,980
I'm still using my kettlebell at 35. So eventually I'll have to buy a 55 pound kettlebell. So

33
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:06,740
all right. Well, I'm not sure how much he's working out, but let's say hello anyway to

34
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:16,500
Techmaster Loki. I'm not working out at all right now. Can we get a flex redeem? Denied.

35
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:22,860
How are you doing, Loki? I'm doing OK. Yeah. Yeah. Anything new and exciting in your world?

36
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:28,860
No. No. Yeah. Mood. I hear you. It's been it's been a week. It's been nothing but rainy

37
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:33,860
and stormy this week. It sort of means no going out and doing anything fun. It's just

38
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:37,340
staying in and playing video games. But that's fun, too. Speaking of video games, what is

39
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:41,620
outside and done stuff? Did you? I didn't. I hardly went outside and did anything. I

40
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:47,260
went I replanted six plants over the last couple of days because they were getting strangled

41
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:52,200
in their teensy little pots. Actually, I will say yesterday it was more overcast. So I was

42
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:57,580
able to go out and do like not to get in my gaming weeks too much, but oops, do like Pokemon

43
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:02,180
Community Day in Pokemon Go because they had a community day yesterday and then Pikmin,

44
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:06,500
all the Niantic games had a community day the same day because who coordinates things over

45
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:12,580
there? I don't know. Coordinate? I can't be bothered to do one office talking to the other.

46
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:20,100
We can't do that. So yeah, so I did get out Saturday, but that was really it. I got in like

47
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:25,300
12,000 steps yesterday. So I guess I could guess I could do a little bit. Really, Mike Defton in

48
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:30,980
our chat because as we tape live, y'all can chat along with us over twitch.tv slash vog network.

49
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:38,260
Deft says speaking of Pokemon Go Community Day for April is Togetic. Wouldn't that be Togope?

50
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:42,740
Wouldn't the baby form spawn or are they actually going to form Togetic everywhere?

51
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:43,780
Is this the upgrade?

52
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:48,180
Yeah, I was gonna say Togetic is the mid form. So that would be weird if it's not

53
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:52,420
Togope's. I would expect would be the interesting. Mike Deft says no, it's Togetic.

54
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:57,380
Interesting. Huh. I wonder why they're doing it that way. I wonder,

55
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:01,460
oh, Deft says baby forms are not usually found in the wild. Well, for some of the other three,

56
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:08,180
I mean, if you consider Bulbasaur a baby form or a lot of the other three evolution, right?

57
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:13,380
Most of the time we do see the base evolution in the wild. So it is a little weird. I think

58
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:16,980
there's gonna be a lot of people to find that weird, but I'm gonna best...

59
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:19,700
If you're looking for baby animals in the wild,

60
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,780
you need to make sure that you leave them with your mother.

61
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:26,740
Yes. Well, I'm gonna guess that for that community day,

62
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:32,020
they do two kilometer eggs and they do like half hatch distance and all of the eggs are

63
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:37,540
gonna have Togope. I bet that's what they do to kind of bridge that gap, so to speak.

64
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:41,620
May have to start playing again just so I can have 57,000 Togope.

65
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:48,020
Or be like Shane and get like 700 shiny ones for no reason than just you love shinies.

66
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:57,300
Well, Togope before Mimikyu was invented, Togope was my favorite and I actually have a very special

67
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:01,940
fond memory for Togope because I don't know, I've told the story about when I got held up

68
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:06,100
at gunpoint working at GNC, right? Yeah. You've mentioned before scary stuff. Yeah.

69
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:11,700
Well, Dan took me to Toys R Us to cheer me up and I found a $20 bill in the parking lot

70
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:17,700
and I used that $20 bill to buy myself a Togope plushie that I still have to this day.

71
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:23,220
It's sort of like my comfort plushie. Your little karma plushie in some ways.

72
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:27,780
That's not exactly how karma works. I know, but okay, you know what I mean.

73
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:35,220
Yeah, but it ended up being like my little comfort, like I kind of felt like

74
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:40,900
maybe the universe wasn't completely shit. You know, Toys R Us is like half back now.

75
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:47,700
They're mini stores inside Macy's. So like as I was walking around downtown yesterday,

76
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:50,980
which by the way was a hoot and a holler here in Sacramento where we're all based,

77
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:55,940
the NCAA championships were going on at the Golden One Center, or I don't know if it's

78
00:06:55,940 --> 00:07:00,580
championships or qualifier, whatever, but the Sacramento Arena was like a site for that.

79
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:04,660
So I don't know sports well enough to tell you what game it was, but I just know there were a

80
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:08,100
fuck ton of people. And yes, that's an actual scientific measurement. There was a fuck ton of

81
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:11,860
people down there, but I was walking through that area anyway. And there's like that Macy's right

82
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:16,180
there. Right. And so you walk by the window and they actually have like a, it's a new style

83
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:21,380
drawing, but they have Jeffrey the giraffe and stuff in the window. Because if you go up to the

84
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:25,300
second floor, there's like a Toys R Us in the Macy's. So that's what it's like. You know how

85
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:30,660
there's like Sephora's inside JC Penney? It's like, they do. It's like that. Yeah. It's like

86
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:39,540
that. I miss the big warehouse. I know. I know, but I sadly think those days may be behind us.

87
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:43,540
So, but at least if you like the mascots, if you like, if you're a Jeffrey the giraffe fan,

88
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:51,060
at least there's that. So free ad for them. All right. Also, I actually have a Toys R Us bag from

89
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:56,180
when they went out of business. Oh, like they got like super cheap or something? Well, no, no. I

90
00:07:56,180 --> 00:08:00,260
mean that like they gave me extra shopping bags, like the plastic bags. Oh, right. Right. Right.

91
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:07,300
Yeah. Little mementos. All right. Yeah. It was nice. Let's move on to giving free advertisements

92
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:12,820
for Nintendo because for our lead topic tonight, I want to talk a little bit about the Wii U and

93
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:19,620
the 3DS are having their stores close. Now, technically the closure date is March 27th.

94
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:24,100
So that's actually a week from Monday. Part of the reason I want to bring it up tonight though,

95
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:29,620
is that I would tell you is that if you want to wait until the very last second,

96
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:34,820
I think that's not a good decision because with time zones, with the way networks work,

97
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:39,620
with sometimes companies really eager to pull the plug, I would not expect that this is going

98
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:45,620
to work the entire length of the day, March 27th. So I really think this is the last week that those

99
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:52,100
shops are open. If you have any 3DS or Wii U purchases that you want to get. And boy,

100
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:56,820
some people want to make a lot of purchases. There's a YouTuber out there by the name,

101
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:03,140
The Completionist. And he's been around the gaming media this week because he actually spent

102
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:14,420
$22,791 getting every single digital title that's available on the Wii U and the 3DS. That's 866

103
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:24,260
Wii U games and 1,547 3DS games, adding up to 1.2 terabytes of Wii U space and 267 gigabytes

104
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:29,460
on the 3DS. Now, this isn't something he did all last night. This whole effort has taken about a

105
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:34,580
year. I will defer to our pal, Bobby Blackwolf, who really went into the weeds tonight on his

106
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:41,460
show about like what the banking restrictions are and what the prepaid cards are. And like,

107
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:46,420
so all these roadblocks that stopped him and his team. It actually wasn't just him. It was

108
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:51,060
his whole team from actually buying every game in one day. So my point is, if you're trying to do

109
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:56,980
what The Completionist did tomorrow, it's too late. The restrictions that are in place with

110
00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:02,260
how much money you can drop before you're triggering security measures, it's too much.

111
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:08,980
But if there are a few pieces of low hanging fruit, so to speak, or things that you can't get

112
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:12,900
physically or whatever that you want to get, you know, this is the week to really think about it

113
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:16,500
if you have either of those systems still connected. And I imagine more of you probably

114
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:24,340
still have access to a 3DS pretty readily than you might the Wii U. Some suggestions to throw out

115
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:30,100
there if you are looking for things on the 3DS, I would highly suggest go back and look at the 3D

116
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:37,300
Classics catalog. Nintendo and Sega both did a round of some 3D classics, and they're very

117
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:43,460
well done for what they are. I know Nintendo had a Kid Icarus one in there. They had some other

118
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:48,020
games too. I don't remember if they had a Metroid. Excitebike, I think, was one of the other games

119
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:51,060
that they did for 3DS. There were some others too. I'll look and chat in a minute here because

120
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:56,820
you probably shout them out. But Sega did quite a few. They had Gunstar Heroes in the catalog,

121
00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:02,180
Sonic, several Sonic games. They had a lot lot in the catalog, and I would recommend those. I think

122
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:08,660
it's actually a missed opportunity that those haven't been re-released, yes, in 2D form on the

123
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:14,820
Switch. Especially in the case of the Nintendo ones. They souped up the classics without going

124
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:20,100
in and doing a complete overhaul and calling them pixel remasters or whatever. They seemed

125
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:26,260
pretty simple, so to speak, at the end of the day. Those would be some things I would recommend.

126
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:32,020
I'm curious in chat, what would you all recommend for the Wii U and the 3DS for titles to go

127
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:37,460
before they go away? I know, again, during Bobby's show, one suggestion that came up that I thought

128
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:43,700
was really good would be the Pokemon Bank. If you want to be able to transfer, you will be able to

129
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:48,260
re-download titles that you've downloaded in the past. Lord knows how much longer you'll be able

130
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:54,180
to do that though. That won't be forever. But you can download things like Pokemon Bank and have

131
00:11:54,180 --> 00:12:01,540
that available to transfer 3DS Pokemon and DS Pokemon into a bank, which then you can transfer

132
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:07,940
into home. That's how you get your Pokemon into modern games. And with that, I would say the 3DS

133
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:14,020
re-release of things like Pokemon Yellow that actually had the Pokemon Transporter built into

134
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:19,780
the old ROMs, which is pretty cool. So you can go catch an old Pikachu from a Game Boy game

135
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:25,140
and transfer it all the way to Pokemon Scarlet. You could do that now. But you have to have all

136
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:31,060
the systems set in place to be able to do that. Fixation Gaze in chat says, I recommend the

137
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:36,100
Phoenix Wright series. It's the best on the 3DS. Yes. Now, I should also say there are

138
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:41,780
quite a few 3DS and Wii U games that are getting remastered on Switch. We have seen a lot of those

139
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:47,060
come back. I think with Phoenix Wright, we're more seeing newer titles. I know there's been a

140
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:52,980
new one announced in that series. So keep an eye out for those. But yeah, certainly the classics,

141
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:58,820
for sure. Dark Tetsuya suggests NES Remix. That is a great concept too. I'm surprised Nintendo has

142
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:04,900
never revisited or re-released that title in any form. There were versions on the 3DS and the Wii

143
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:09,860
U, if I remember right. I want to say the Wii U had a volume one and a volume two, and the 3DS

144
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:15,620
had a retail release that was like a mishmash of both, like a best of from both. I would highly

145
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:21,860
recommend those. SheHulk10 suggests Xenoblade X Chronicles only on Wii U. That's a really good

146
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:27,060
one. Absolutely. That's a Xenoblade game they haven't brought on the Switch yet. I think they're

147
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:33,460
saving it for the Switch's successor. But maybe that's just wishful thinking. Mike Devton chat

148
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:41,140
suggests Rhythm Heaven Megamix for all my rhythm game enthusiasts. Bonds006 suggests Fire Emblem.

149
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:48,580
I believe didn't the original Fire Emblem come out as a standalone on Switch eShop? I want to say

150
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:51,620
that was the thing they announced during one of the directs because they did like a really expensive

151
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:56,660
physical release for some reason of that too. I know there were certain

152
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:03,140
games in the series that are there too, so certainly worth looking at as well.

153
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:08,500
Mike Dev suggests Kirby's Adventure 3D. That was the definitive version of playing that game.

154
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:15,300
sg100map backs up that the 3D classics are great. Gunstar Heroes, Streets of Rage, and Outrun to

155
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:20,340
name a few. That's right. Outrun in the 3DS classics is really good. Really, really good.

156
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:27,460
The thing is with a lot of those games though is I already have a bunch of them elsewhere.

157
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:34,980
That would be for me my reason for not going after some of these. It's cool to have them

158
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:44,980
on the console, but it's also extra money. Yeah, it is. I think what made the 3D versions

159
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:48,900
unique would be, well, the 3D, you're not really going to get that a lot of other places. But they

160
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:52,660
did. I don't remember the Sega classics particularly. Chat, you might have to back me

161
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:57,060
up, but I know the Nintendo ones, they actually did enhance the original ROMs a little bit.

162
00:14:57,060 --> 00:15:01,220
Now, of course, if you want your experience pure, then this is actually going to be a turn

163
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:05,780
off for you and not a reason to get it. For me, I thought it was a nice little fresh coat of paint

164
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:10,580
on the old games. I liked what they did with that. I thought that was really cool. sg100map says,

165
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:16,580
we'll likely not see anything 3D like this again. Don't see Nintendo revisiting 3D again. I agree

166
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:22,980
with that. Remember 3D televisions? Those kind of came and went, didn't they? They barely do 3D

167
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:28,900
movies anymore. I know they exist, but I feel like now it's 4D. Have you heard about this whole

168
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:35,540
thing? People going to see Scream 6, and when people get killed, it splashes water to simulate

169
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:40,740
blood. It's 4D stuff that they're doing now. 4D. The fourth dimension is time.

170
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:45,860
Well, you know, that's what they call it. Hey, go back and watch Hypercube. It was a

171
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:53,300
good movie. I didn't get my chance on the Star Trek Cruise. I'm very disappointed because Nicole

172
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:58,580
DeBauer was there, and I wanted to say, I loved you in Cube, but I didn't get my chance because

173
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:13,620
she also was the other Jax in season seven. But yeah, Jazita. I always butcher the names. Anyway,

174
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:19,540
uh, Fixation Gaze says, I will say Universal was doing 4D way long ago in their parks for

175
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:24,820
the Shrek rides. Yeah. So that's where, that's where the whole 4D phenomenon came from.

176
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:31,380
But yeah. Oh, Tiger Claw says Super Mario movie will be in 3D. I know they still do 3D movies,

177
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:37,700
but I feel like that's the theaters kind of shoehorning the technology that they paid all

178
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:41,300
this money to implement and they're like refusing to walk away from it until they have to.

179
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:47,540
Uh, I feel like it's not pushed as much as it used to be when like Avatar was new. I mean,

180
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:53,380
the original Avatar was new, you know, that sort of thing. So, you know, my, my thing with,

181
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:57,780
with 3D and cinema is that it needs to be there to enhance the movie and not a gimmick.

182
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:03,540
Yeah. Yeah. And it's the same with, with, you know, if they bring back like that whole

183
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:10,180
lenticular thing that the 3DS had or any other sort of, of 3D technology, it needs to be an

184
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:16,900
enhancement and not a gimmick. Uh, dark to see us speaking of probably the most gimmicky 3D,

185
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:22,580
or if I say 4D experience I've ever seen, the 3D I miss is like they did for Honey,

186
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:26,580
I Shrunk the Audience. I don't know if they do that for movies anymore.

187
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:31,860
Do not mess with that because it was Rick Moranis and Eric Idle.

188
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:39,380
But remember, remember Honey I Shrunk the Audience was, was a thing, but I would say the

189
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:45,860
first 4D was Captain EO before that, remember this Captain EO before that, that was the first 4D.

190
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:52,580
I wish I had gone to the original Captain EO. I kind of am sad that I missed it, but I did like

191
00:17:52,580 --> 00:18:00,820
the revival, but it, I'm sorry, Captain EO is, is pinnacle, pinnacle.

192
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:03,620
Yeah. It's, it's one of those things where it's like, I, I, I actually-

193
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:05,860
Angelica Houston being a goddess. Hello.

194
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:11,060
I still kind of believe Captain EO needs a place in Disney park somewhere. I understand they give

195
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:15,060
it a lot of real estate, but I feel like Captain EO, they should do at least one showing a day.

196
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:21,940
Like there's always like so many of us of a certain age, you know, despite however you feel

197
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:27,940
about Michael Jackson at this point and everything, the thing is Captain EO is like-

198
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:28,420
Amazing.

199
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:29,940
It's childhood.

200
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:30,980
Staple and icon.

201
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:32,660
A staple, exactly.

202
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:33,300
It's unique.

203
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:35,140
It is unique.

204
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:35,620
And thankfully-

205
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:38,180
It's going to change the world. We are going to change the world.

206
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:43,460
Some people, by the way, have gone in and done sort of their own remaster of it,

207
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:47,860
where they combine the 3D elements into a single, you know, 2D experience,

208
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,220
and the whole thing is up on YouTube.

209
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:52,180
Oh yeah. I'm, I'm, that one's, I'm pretty sure-

210
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:53,940
I go back and watch it at least once a month.

211
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:57,700
I'm pretty sure Honey I Shrunk the Audience is all on YouTube as well at this point,

212
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:00,260
you know, fan cams basically, but it's there.

213
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:04,660
I have two things that I go back and watch at least once a month, three, sorry, three.

214
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:06,100
One of them is Captain EO.

215
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:10,660
The other one is Interstellar 5555.

216
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:13,380
And the other one is the Princess Bride.

217
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:15,220
Inconceivable.

218
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,100
You keep saying that word.

219
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:19,220
Do you even know what it means?

220
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:21,940
No, I do not think it means what you think it means.

221
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:27,620
Back to the topic we were talking about, Wii U and 3DS.

222
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:28,900
So the stores are closing.

223
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:31,940
I'm curious for my co-hosts, is there anything you're going to miss?

224
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:34,820
Or are you just kind of like, let it, let, let it die.

225
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:36,580
Let it die.

226
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:42,420
For me, I mean, this is one of those things that seems inevitable in this day and age,

227
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:47,620
but obviously there is hurt feelings because for game preservation,

228
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:51,140
this stinks because there were so many digital only titles.

229
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:58,100
And what we see Nintendo doing is not what we see Microsoft or even to some extent Sony doing,

230
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:03,060
which is having that digital catalog be available when you buy a new system,

231
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:05,140
thanks to backwards compatibility.

232
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:10,180
You know, I think we can all cross our fingers and hope and pray thoughts, prayers, rainbows,

233
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:14,820
wishes, whatever you want to, that there's going to be something on the future Nintendo

234
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:20,020
console, but I'm not going to hold my breath with that whole thing.

235
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:26,500
And so that's the part that's kind of sad is that these games will essentially be lost to time.

236
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:32,340
Although with preservationist efforts, like what, you know, this YouTuber did in

237
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:34,100
downloading the entire archive.

238
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:43,140
And let's be real, the ethical question of is piracy and emulation an ethical thing to do?

239
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:48,660
That argument changes significantly once the stores are closed and literally your ability

240
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:51,780
to buy these games and pay money for them goes away.

241
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:53,860
And I'll let you fill in the gaps with what I'm saying.

242
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:56,340
But it's, oh, go ahead.

243
00:20:57,060 --> 00:21:00,900
I was going to say if things lately have taught me anything,

244
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:03,060
it's that ethics are subjective these days.

245
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:04,520
True.

246
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:09,860
And I would just say like, if I'm going to play these games,

247
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:13,300
I do not feel bad about emulating them after March 27th.

248
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:21,060
Well, and the thing about it to also add is that the intent and the impact are two different

249
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:21,560
things.

250
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:29,780
And if the overall, if the intent is good and the impact comes out positively, then yeah, great.

251
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:36,820
But you can always have good intent and have the end result come out pretty shitty.

252
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:40,820
And of course, as far as what that end result is going to be,

253
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:43,780
that is going to be another subjective thing.

254
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:47,380
Nintendo might see it one way, we as the public will see it another.

255
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:51,940
What's going to be the prevailing thought?

256
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:52,440
Okay.

257
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:56,660
Fixation Gays in Chat says, once you cannot buy it legitimately,

258
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:58,260
it's out the window, honestly.

259
00:21:58,260 --> 00:21:59,460
Yeah, I agree with that.

260
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:00,900
That's my theory.

261
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:02,020
I agree with that.

262
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:10,340
But I mean, again, we're looking at honestly, I think that if they're going to take it off

263
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:14,820
of the market, they know there's going to be a quote, black market.

264
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:19,860
Some people, and to be fair, some people, and they have a right to this opinion,

265
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:24,980
say that no, you're still not in an ethically good place by doing that.

266
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:29,380
Because this is similar to how Disney used to vault, I'll come back to the minute,

267
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:31,060
used to vault their old movies.

268
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:31,540
Remember that?

269
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:36,100
You had to buy that movie on VHS in the little clamshell case, and it would go back into

270
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:38,980
the Disney vault as of whatever date.

271
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:43,540
You can never buy it again, or they'd be up to collectors sky high.

272
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:48,420
But, important footnote, Disney came around eventually.

273
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:51,620
Once the technology was in place, guess what Disney Plus offers?

274
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:53,380
There's no more vault.

275
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:58,180
You can watch everything on Disney Plus, except for the controversial ones, you know,

276
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:00,660
the things that Disney is not going to put out, period.

277
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:06,740
They think should be released as a teaching element.

278
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:12,180
Yeah, because if I didn't say that, someone would, but otherwise, for the most part,

279
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:17,300
those titles are open and available on Disney Plus as far as things like The Little Mermaid

280
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:20,020
to Snow White to Treasure Planet and whatever.

281
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:23,700
They're all available on Disney Plus at this point.

282
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,460
So finally, they came around eventually.

283
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:30,100
And the reason why I say that is because maybe someday, Nintendo does the same thing.

284
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:30,580
Maybe.

285
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:31,940
Maybe Disney shows that as well.

286
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:36,420
DGRMS says, I have a bunch of those clamshell VHS Disney movies.

287
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:40,260
Those clamshells are icons of the 80s and 90s, as far as I'm concerned.

288
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:42,500
Those are icons of the 80s.

289
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:43,220
So you know what?

290
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:46,340
They're still collector values and things like that.

291
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:51,220
So I wish that I had still had my copy of Peach Dragon.

292
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:55,300
I mean, it's since come out on DVD, but for the longest time, the only way you could get

293
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,300
that was on VHS.

294
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:59,780
And I loved that movie as a kid.

295
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:00,740
I love Helen Reddy.

296
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:02,660
That was the movie that made me love Helen Reddy.

297
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:04,820
All right.

298
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:09,620
Well, while we reminisce, let's take a moment and reminisce our past week as we talk about

299
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:13,140
our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing this week.

300
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:14,980
So Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

301
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:17,140
Pretty eventful.

302
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:24,180
Of course, I played a lot of Dead by Daylight, and I played it with Fixy.

303
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:24,900
Hi, Fixy.

304
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:28,420
And Gwen and Shayla.

305
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:31,780
You have a little squad now I always see you playing with.

306
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:34,500
We call ourselves Team Yeet.

307
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,060
Team Yeet.

308
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:36,580
Yeah, I lurk.

309
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:37,060
I lurk.

310
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:39,060
You don't know I'm there, but I'm there.

311
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:46,020
And there is a video on YouTube of the origin day of Team Yeet and a farming ghost face.

312
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:51,060
But yeah, we do our thing.

313
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:55,860
I actually adapted Sadako on Sunday.

314
00:24:56,900 --> 00:25:02,180
And I don't know if it was because I remembered all of my skills very suddenly or I had a

315
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:03,220
bunch of flops.

316
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:08,580
It was probably a combination of both, but I got my Sadako adapt without really trying.

317
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:16,260
That's five out of how many killers now I still need to regain my...

318
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:17,860
I've got all the survivors adapted.

319
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:22,260
I played a lot of Marvel Midnight Suns.

320
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:27,860
I played it on stream last night because I learned that my controller is incompatible

321
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:29,140
with my SNES emulator.

322
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:34,660
I have actually ordered a controller specifically for my SNES emulator.

323
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:40,180
And again, I can legally play these games on stream because I own the original Super

324
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:41,460
Famicom cartridges.

325
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:41,860
The end.

326
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,100
So yeah, Letterman jackets.

327
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:45,460
We're going to do Letterman jackets.

328
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:49,380
Ranja, I don't remember.

329
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:54,180
I'll tell you offline for what controller I ordered.

330
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:58,260
But at any rate, I also played a bunch of pinball.

331
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:03,540
And I got into a very fun discussion about pinball with the one and only Brianna Wu.

332
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:08,980
We're online friends now.

333
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:12,820
And I am hoping that I actually get to play pinball with her.

334
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:14,340
I think that would be absolutely fun.

335
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:16,260
She's got quite the collection.

336
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:17,380
I was very impressed.

337
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:18,900
Isn't she on the other coast?

338
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:21,460
Didn't she run for office out in Maryland or something?

339
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:23,540
Well, I mean, things happen.

340
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:28,740
I mean, if there's a convention or anything, I'm still planning on going out that way.

341
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:33,620
Paxis is this weekend, speaking of that part of the country.

342
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:37,380
I know, but it just reminded me, Paxis is this weekend.

343
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:43,540
But we talked pinball, and I really want to play the Halloween pinball.

344
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:44,500
And she's got one.

345
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:45,860
I want to play it.

346
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:50,420
But I've been playing a lot of Beatles Mania and World Cup Soccer, because World Cup Soccer

347
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:51,060
is my favorite.

348
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:57,140
I also have been playing my stupid word game.

349
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:04,260
It's sad when I can solve one of the, quote, super hard puzzles in 20 seconds.

350
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:08,100
And what else did I do?

351
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:15,460
Oh, yeah, I played a little Jackie Crush, the last in the Crush series.

352
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:16,260
We had Alien Crush.

353
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:17,140
Oh, yeah.

354
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:18,260
You've highlighted that before.

355
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:20,500
I'm almost positive in the classic game segment.

356
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:26,500
Jackie Crush is the SNES one, which is the final entry in the Crush series of pinball

357
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:26,820
games.

358
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:28,580
I just like how it starts.

359
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,180
You have all the demon faces that scroll out.

360
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:31,460
It goes, Jackie Crush.

361
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:35,140
And what else did I play?

362
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:38,340
Because I played other stuff, and I don't remember.

363
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:42,340
Yeah, I think that that might be it.

364
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:46,260
Yeah, I can't remember what else.

365
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:49,060
I know that there was something else on my list, but I don't remember.

366
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:49,940
So fuck it.

367
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:54,100
I played a lot of Dead by Daylight.

368
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:57,940
All right, let's go over to Loki.

369
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:59,220
How is your gaming week?

370
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:00,420
It's just Minecraft.

371
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:02,740
Still working on my project.

372
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:07,940
I finally got to the part where I'm actually filming stuff and building in the SMP now.

373
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:12,900
So hoping to have an episode out very soon, because it's been a very long time.

374
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,420
What happened with the Minecraft contest?

375
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:16,100
Because wasn't that over on the 15th?

376
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:18,420
Yeah, the cutoff was on the 15th.

377
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:19,780
They haven't announced anything yet.

378
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:20,820
Oh, okay.

379
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:22,500
So they're just taking their time.

380
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:23,720
Fair.

381
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:26,420
So probably this week sometime.

382
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:26,740
All right.

383
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:30,020
Well, still crossing my fingers for you, even if it's just a shout out.

384
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:32,340
Hey, it's still an acknowledgement.

385
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:33,940
It's a senpai notice me moment.

386
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:34,900
So it's fine.

387
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:37,140
Anything else for your gaming week?

388
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:38,500
No, that's it.

389
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:42,420
I end up stuff on the Steam sale that I probably will buy and not play.

390
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:45,780
I keep forgetting that there was a Steam sale that just started.

391
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:46,740
Oh, that's dangerous.

392
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:47,540
All right.

393
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:51,220
Yeah, I keep seeing Final Fantasy VII integrate in there.

394
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:54,420
I was like, sure.

395
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:57,220
Maybe I've been watching Alan.

396
00:28:57,220 --> 00:29:00,100
Alan's been doing some streaming of that on his channel.

397
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:05,940
And his whole thing now is he mods games and streams them with the mods.

398
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:07,940
And I suppose I should shout out my husband here.

399
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:09,860
He's going to do a stream on Tuesday.

400
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:12,660
So he's been playing Mass Effect 2 modded.

401
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:17,220
And sorry, Jamie, I think this conflicts with one of your streams, but Alan's been working

402
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:17,860
very hard on this.

403
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:18,500
I'm going to plug it.

404
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:26,020
He's going to beat Mass Effect 2 modded on Tuesday at 10 30 Eastern and do the ending

405
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:26,340
sequence.

406
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:30,740
But what's special about it, he's been modding it so that he can romance Thane because there's

407
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:35,380
actually dialogue, I guess, that is there that was not in the actual release.

408
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:42,100
So Thane was romanceable by a lady in Mass Effect 2, but not by a male character.

409
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:45,380
This mod has unlocked the male and Thane romance.

410
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:49,620
So he's going to show that on stream on Tuesday and beat the game, which, of course, what's

411
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:49,780
that?

412
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:51,220
It was dialogue?

413
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:51,700
Yeah.

414
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:55,540
Apparently there was dialogue like there was in the first game for a Kaiden male romance.

415
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:58,420
Something like that where there's ghost dialogue or something.

416
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:01,780
So yeah, like it was in there and then coded out.

417
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:03,060
Yep, exactly.

418
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:06,660
So thanks to modders.

419
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:07,140
It's back.

420
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:08,820
So that's something he's going to be doing on Tuesday.

421
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:12,500
And if there's just so many streams you want to watch and you can't choose, he'll be happy

422
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:13,460
if you watch the VOD.

423
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:15,140
So and that'll all be highlighted as well.

424
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:17,220
So there's that.

425
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:18,180
So let's see.

426
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:20,980
Otherwise, my gaming week, the types of games I've been playing, streaming, whatever it

427
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:21,140
is.

428
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:23,300
Theatrhythm continuing on with that.

429
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:25,460
The World Ends With You DLC came out this week.

430
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:27,220
I streamed a little bit of that earlier this week.

431
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:28,660
Really good music.

432
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,820
And I'm not super familiar with that series.

433
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:33,700
I have to admit, like, I'm familiar that it exists.

434
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:35,940
I just didn't really play them start to finish.

435
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:37,300
There's some really good songs in that.

436
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:39,380
There's some bangers in that game.

437
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:42,020
So I was really happy with the DLC for Theatrhythm.

438
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:43,300
I've been playing a little bit of that.

439
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:47,620
I also continuing just a little bit of Dead by Daylight, not as much as Dark Sakura, but

440
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:50,020
maybe a game a day or something like that.

441
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:52,660
Just to keep my skills up to speed.

442
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:53,780
I remembered my other game.

443
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:54,660
I played Among Us.

444
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:56,020
Oh, that's right.

445
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,220
You've been getting into that lately.

446
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:01,700
I've been playing with Raven McPherson, Arty, and all them.

447
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:02,740
Yeah, yeah.

448
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:05,220
So I didn't mean to cut you off, but I just remembered.

449
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:08,980
Mike Def says, glad they included with World Ends With You some of the songs in Neo.

450
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:11,540
Yeah, it's three from the original and three from Neo.

451
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:13,620
So it's some good round of DLC.

452
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:14,340
I enjoyed it.

453
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:17,220
Very much looking forward to the Nier DLC, which will be next week.

454
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:19,700
So definitely will play that as well.

455
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:22,900
I've also been playing No Man's Sky.

456
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:26,100
I'm really close to finishing the expedition if I hadn't.

457
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:30,100
So unfortunately, I fucked myself on stream.

458
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,220
Not in that kind of way.

459
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:31,860
Really?

460
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:33,140
I'm not talking about an OF.

461
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:39,220
I'm talking about when you get yourself into a logic problem live on stream and the logic

462
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:46,580
problem was in No Man's Sky, the logic problem was you can only craft material at your base

463
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:48,260
in this latest mission.

464
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:52,900
I landed on a planet and I landed and I was out of starship fuel.

465
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:57,540
I could not craft more starship fuel because I was nowhere near my base.

466
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:01,780
I would have had to have walked four hours on the planet to get to my base.

467
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:09,540
So what I had to do, I had to construct an all new base in order to build the starship

468
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:11,380
fuel so I could take off.

469
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:15,060
So Quest Buster says I'm a little halfway through that expedition.

470
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:18,580
So learn from Uncle Rob what not to do.

471
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:21,220
And here's how to get yourself out of those situations.

472
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:26,660
So Quest Buster, always keep the material on you to build one extra base.

473
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:31,460
And it's a lot of chromatic metal and a lot because they amped it up from what it normally

474
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:34,500
costs next to nothing to build a computer base.

475
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:41,140
But this time they amped it up to like 250 chromatic metal and like 500 ferret dust or

476
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:41,460
something.

477
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:44,500
It's like magnetized ferret or something.

478
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:45,460
It's enhanced.

479
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:51,940
So always keep the material on you so that you don't screw yourself over like I did.

480
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:56,420
Because if I hadn't done that and had to spend 45 minutes fixing that situation I got myself

481
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:58,900
in, I probably would have beat on stream.

482
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:04,260
So yeah, Quest Buster says I ran into a similar problem early on when I remembered that I

483
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:07,060
could only craft near a base and I was kind of far away.

484
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:12,580
As long as you keep the mats on you for a base at all times, you can always just craft

485
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:13,300
a new base.

486
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:17,300
It doesn't have to be the base that the game sends you to in that expedition.

487
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:18,340
That's something I learned.

488
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:22,020
So by the way, that expedition only has two or three weeks left in it.

489
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:24,660
So if you haven't started it yet, I would highly encourage you to.

490
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:27,060
And I believe the Switch has expeditions now.

491
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:31,940
Some of you on the Switch may have to tell me if I'm wrong on that, but I'm pretty sure

492
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:36,740
they added that with the big VR update that pushed for PlayStation is that Switch now

493
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:37,300
has expeditions.

494
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:39,460
Actually, it might have been before that for the encores.

495
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:41,620
So Switch, you can do the expeditions on.

496
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:46,420
So other big important one that I left out of my game a week.

497
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:50,020
I got to talk about this because I played so much of it this weekend.

498
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:51,860
I'm probably going cross-eyed.

499
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:59,220
And that is, I played the shit out of the Diablo 4 beta, which that went up this weekend

500
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:05,060
for those that either pre-ordered the game, which was me, or stomach to KFC Double Down,

501
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:06,660
which is other people.

502
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:09,620
Was it good or did it Diablo?

503
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:12,420
It is fantastic.

504
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:15,700
It is fantastic.

505
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:18,580
I am so hyped for Diablo.

506
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:24,980
So I may have had an inkling that this game was already in good shape because there was

507
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:25,860
a closed beta.

508
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:30,020
I can't say I was in the if I was in the closed beta, I'm not allowed to say I was.

509
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:36,260
But now that there's an open beta, we can be open and talk a little more about Diablo

510
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:37,620
4 and what's so great about it.

511
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:44,660
I think if you were put off by Diablo 3 in some ways, I think this is the sequel you

512
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:50,740
wanted to Diablo 2, because Diablo 2, there's a lot more of Diablo 2's roots in this game

513
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:54,820
in the way that it's, not to say, because I love Diablo 3 and I still love this one

514
00:34:54,820 --> 00:35:02,820
because there's a lot of quality of life stuff that Diablo 3 brought in that now is in Diablo

515
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:03,300
4.

516
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:04,500
But they do different things.

517
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:09,620
Now it's like the open world and they have all these different systems and the storytelling

518
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:12,020
they have really amped up.

519
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:14,180
That was most impressive to me.

520
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:19,060
The way they do some of the artistic directions and the cut scenes and stuff is like stuff

521
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:19,780
in The Witcher.

522
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:20,660
It's really good.

523
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:26,020
So this game has been in development forever, but it's showing.

524
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:32,340
All of these different dungeons that you do, although yes, there's only so many background

525
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:36,820
patterns you see in a Diablo game, it's varied enough, these dungeons, to feel like you're

526
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:38,020
doing something new.

527
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:41,540
I played multiplayer with some other people that were in the open beta.

528
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:43,220
It played very well.

529
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:50,020
My only concern was that I got some really bad graphics stuttering playing on high-end

530
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:52,180
graphics on my less than a year old computer.

531
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:55,780
However, when I turned it down to medium, it was fine.

532
00:35:55,780 --> 00:36:00,260
It is a beta, and those are the types of problems that are usually present in a beta.

533
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:05,060
So I'm not like, I've already dropped the $100 for the Super Mega Deluxe Edition of

534
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:05,620
this game.

535
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:08,740
So look, this doesn't, they've already got me.

536
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:12,340
I have no room to judge, given that I paid 100 for Midnight Suns.

537
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:13,860
There's, yeah.

538
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:18,820
So look, any little complaints I have here, or if you're going to go, well, it's just

539
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:19,460
a beta, Rob.

540
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:20,260
You shouldn't judge again.

541
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:25,300
No, I did not judge the game because I've paid a lot of money for the full retail release

542
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:26,660
of this game already.

543
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:29,140
So, but yeah.

544
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:33,140
Questbuster in chat says the world boss is horrifying.

545
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:36,500
I saw, I haven't seen the world boss, but I have seen world quests, and that's a new

546
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:37,380
thing to Diablo.

547
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:41,380
They actually put in MMO-like elements, but it's not an MMO.

548
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:43,140
It's weird.

549
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:46,420
Like, it's seamless for Diablo.

550
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:47,700
It works really well.

551
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:54,740
The open beta is next weekend, and you don't need a KFC Double Down, so I would encourage

552
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:58,100
if you're curious about it, check out the open beta next weekend.

553
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:01,300
It's only going to be three days, but that's your chance to see if it's for you or not.

554
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:03,940
Bobby Blackwolf says, are there colors?

555
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:04,500
Actually, yeah.

556
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:08,420
I know the game has been getting a little bit of flack because the overworld, the open

557
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:13,860
world is mostly a snowy world, so it's very plain white, snowed out, but when you start

558
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:18,580
to get into some of the dungeons that are shiny and have the metallic effects and the

559
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:22,420
fountains of blood, because this is a Diablo game, and it is nasty.

560
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:28,260
I'm not a big violent, so there are parts of this game that make me go, ugh, but those

561
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:29,780
are only in the cutscenes.

562
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:35,140
Usually as you're playing the game, the camera's pulled back so far, you don't see graphic,

563
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:36,180
graphic violence.

564
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:36,900
It's implied.

565
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:38,180
It's all implied.

566
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:39,220
When you're playing the game.

567
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:41,780
In cutscenes, it's more than implied.

568
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:47,220
So I will caution, but you can skip cutscenes if you are not interested in that.

569
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:48,900
You just want to click a lot and get loot.

570
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:50,340
There is that.

571
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:55,700
So Dark Tetsuya says, I'll probably get it on console, especially if the console versions

572
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:57,060
have local co-op.

573
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:58,420
I believe they do.

574
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:02,740
I'm not, don't quote me on that, but I'll tell you what it did have even during this

575
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:06,980
beta and will have in the full release that the other games needed badly.

576
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:07,780
Crossplay.

577
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:10,500
So remember I said I partied with friends.

578
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:12,660
I played with Shane and Xtavor and Xtavor's husband.

579
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:18,660
Myself, Xtavor's husband, and I think Xtavor were all on PC, but Shane was on PS5 and we

580
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:20,100
all played together seamlessly.

581
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:23,940
And thanks to the PS5 Discord integration, we were all on a Discord call.

582
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:32,900
So yeah, it's 2023, we are eating good in 2023 when it comes to video games.

583
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:36,660
Honestly, if it was just Diablo 4, I would be like, this is it.

584
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:39,380
This is the game I'm going to play more than any other this year.

585
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:40,420
I can't say that.

586
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:45,220
Theat rhythms already come out and you see I played too much of that as it is.

587
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:51,300
There is also, Zelda has that sequel coming out this year, Tears of the Kingdom.

588
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:53,300
That's like out two weeks before Diablo.

589
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:56,420
Three weeks after Diablo, Final Fantasy 16.

590
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:59,460
Later this winter, supposedly, Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth.

591
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:01,620
And that's just the tip of the iceberg.

592
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:07,540
This year is going to be unprecedented for the level of games that we're getting.

593
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:13,140
And if these other games have the quality of Diablo 4 and the polish that three years

594
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:17,540
of a pandemic and working extra long on the game has brought, holy shit.

595
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:22,340
Yeah, and folks in chat, Mike Deff says Street Fighter 6.

596
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:26,180
Bobby Blackwolf says Hi-Fi Rush, already a surprise hit coming.

597
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:28,580
You're right, we don't even know the surprise hits that are coming.

598
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:31,460
This is a year.

599
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:35,940
And then that doesn't even count games we can't stop playing.

600
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:38,100
Dead by Daylight, Dark Sakura.

601
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:41,620
Or Final Fantasy 14, self-call out.

602
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:43,780
You know, or Minecraft, Loki call out.

603
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:49,140
Whatever it is, there are still games that we still keep playing because they keep patching

604
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:50,980
them, enhancing them, and making them good.

605
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:53,940
Oh my God, Quest Buster reminded me, Starfield.

606
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:56,660
I have to quit my job.

607
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:00,420
Just kidding.

608
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:01,220
I love my job.

609
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:01,700
I really do.

610
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:03,140
And that's what pays for games.

611
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:05,220
But when am I going to have the time to do it?

612
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:06,100
I just, I'm not.

613
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:12,980
So this is, you are cracking me the hell up.

614
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:13,480
Why?

615
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:16,180
Just because you're being so funny.

616
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:16,900
But it's true.

617
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:20,980
This is such a good year to be excited about video games.

618
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:24,980
There's just, there really is something for everyone this year in particular.

619
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:26,820
And I don't know what it is about this year.

620
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:27,620
It really is there.

621
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:29,140
They're still yelling them off in chat.

622
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:30,660
Exo Primal coming out.

623
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:33,620
Persona rereleases coming out.

624
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:37,860
Cyberpunk, for those that got into that, is going to be getting, I believe, an expansion.

625
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:39,860
Octopath Traveler 2 just came out.

626
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:41,940
This is a great year for games.

627
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:44,180
Shedding a tear.

628
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:44,980
Yeah.

629
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:45,480
All right.

630
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:46,660
But yes.

631
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:48,740
Will your heart go on, Rob?

632
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:50,900
Near, far, wherever you are.

633
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:54,020
But Diablo 4, yes.

634
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:57,380
Bolded, underlined, italicized.

635
00:40:57,380 --> 00:40:58,100
I'm excited.

636
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:00,660
So there it is.

637
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:01,460
All right.

638
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:01,940
Yes.

639
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:05,860
Actually, the open beta this weekend didn't even have Druid or Necromancer in it.

640
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:07,780
Those will be in the beta next weekend.

641
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:12,500
So I fully expect that everybody's going to be Druid or Necromancer or the people that

642
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:15,220
didn't play this weekend that are finally getting around to doing Sorcerer or whatever

643
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:15,620
they pick.

644
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:20,420
So it's going to be an interesting, by the way, your progress in the beta does not carry

645
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:28,260
over to the live game, except if you get to level 20 in the beta, you get a wolf doggy

646
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:31,220
that you carry around with you in your little backpack.

647
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:32,900
It's a cosmetic reward.

648
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:39,620
So I'm trying to show an image of what that looks like here.

649
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:40,820
So we're live on Twitch.

650
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:43,220
I found one.

651
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:44,420
How do I get it to come up here?

652
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:46,820
Sorry.

653
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:48,420
Very excited about the whole thing.

654
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:49,140
I'm doing live.

655
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:54,660
I've been waiting for this game a very, very long time, and it's finally here, and I'm

656
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:55,540
very excited.

657
00:41:56,100 --> 00:42:00,900
This is not the best representation as we're live, because I can't get the gift to play

658
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:01,380
any larger.

659
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:02,180
Oh, maybe I do that.

660
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:02,680
There we go.

661
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:08,020
It's actually a little wolf dog that sleeps in a little cradle in your back.

662
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:10,500
That is the reward you get for getting to level 20, right?

663
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:12,660
Oh, my God.

664
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:14,980
I don't even like Diablo, and I want to play this now.

665
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:18,660
Here's the thing, and this is the dangerous part.

666
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:23,700
Because Diablo four, they're not supposed to be doing the same stuff they did with Immortal

667
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:25,780
where it's all because Immortal was a free to play game.

668
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:26,500
That's old news.

669
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:31,620
The experience you buy it and whatever, it's all in one, but they're still going to be

670
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:34,660
doing battle passes and all that stuff for cosmetics.

671
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:36,740
But here's the thing.

672
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:38,660
Diablo kills it with cosmetics.

673
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:40,180
Case and point.

674
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:44,900
What I just showed, like, there are lots of people like Dark Sakura, lots of people that

675
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:49,140
are like, I wasn't caring about Diablo until you showed me that.

676
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:52,180
Honestly, it's still not enough for me to play it.

677
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:53,940
Fine.

678
00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:58,100
But I seriously had the thought.

679
00:42:58,100 --> 00:42:59,060
You had the thought.

680
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:01,620
You had an impure thought.

681
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:03,700
I did.

682
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:07,700
That just moment of absolute weakness was like,

683
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:14,580
All right, let's see.

684
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:18,900
We're going to move on and get into some other stuff that's going on in the gaming world

685
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:21,060
and talk about what's up in news this week.

686
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:24,980
First, though, I want to address this because we had a redeem.

687
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:26,500
So we have a redeem on our channel.

688
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:30,180
If you want to turn in some points, you can get a post show shout out.

689
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:32,900
And Dark Tetsuya actually redeemed one of those.

690
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:38,420
But I am going to upgrade this for free on the house to a during the show shout out.

691
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:43,300
Usually that means it hits the podcast feed because this is an important one to state.

692
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:47,540
And that is, if at all possible, can I donate this one to my wife?

693
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:48,580
Meeshkins.

694
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:49,700
Today's her birthday.

695
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:51,460
Absolutely, you can.

696
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:54,500
And I want to wish a very happy birthday to Meesh.

697
00:43:54,500 --> 00:44:00,340
Meeshkins, but we all call Meesh for short, who has been such a support, not just here

698
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:03,380
at the VoG network, but I know I see her on my streams.

699
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:08,580
I'm sure she pops in to all the other faces around the voice geeks network and on Twitter

700
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:09,860
and all of that stuff.

701
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:11,380
Such a support of the network.

702
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:15,780
So this one's upgraded on the house because I want to personally wish you a happy birthday

703
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:23,140
and hope you have had a wonderful one and may the next year bring lots of awesome games.

704
00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:25,140
Spoiler alert, it's going to.

705
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:27,940
So we love you, Meeshi.

706
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:32,820
All right, well, now let's get into some gaming news.

707
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:34,580
What's going on in the industry?

708
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:38,820
Here's a big one to start us off about the place we call home on Sunday nights.

709
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:39,380
Right, Loki?

710
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:48,180
Yes, apparently the CEO of Twitch, Emmet Sheer, is no longer at the company after 16 years

711
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:48,820
working there.

712
00:44:49,940 --> 00:44:54,980
Basically, he has resigned, I think having to do with raising his children.

713
00:44:55,860 --> 00:45:01,700
Basically, he had posted a blog post saying with my first child just born, I've been reflecting

714
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:02,900
on my future at Twitch.

715
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:06,980
Twitch often feels like a child to me that I've been raising well.

716
00:45:06,980 --> 00:45:12,340
And while I will always want to be there if Twitch needs me, at 16 years old, it feels

717
00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:15,140
to me that Twitch is ready to move out of the house and venture alone.

718
00:45:15,940 --> 00:45:18,260
So cool.

719
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:19,220
Focus on family.

720
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:26,180
I don't know who else they have coming in, though, to take his page.

721
00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:26,900
It's out there.

722
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:28,900
It's somebody with the company today.

723
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:30,740
Keep digging.

724
00:45:30,740 --> 00:45:32,180
It's in there somewhere.

725
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:33,300
It's currently.

726
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:35,300
Someone.

727
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:35,800
Yes.

728
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:38,500
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says he's still at the company.

729
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:40,660
He's an advisor now, but that, you know.

730
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:41,540
Yeah, that's fine.

731
00:45:41,540 --> 00:45:44,260
Sometimes that can be more of a ceremonial title, but you know.

732
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:44,500
Yeah.

733
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:47,460
Basically, he said, you know, it's family.

734
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:52,020
With Greville, my son, the time has come for me to focus my energies on building that tiny

735
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:55,140
little startup family, and I'm ready to dedicate my energies there.

736
00:45:55,140 --> 00:45:55,700
Cool.

737
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:56,580
I think you should.

738
00:45:56,580 --> 00:45:56,980
Yeah.

739
00:45:56,980 --> 00:45:59,540
I mean, you can't fault him for the reasons.

740
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:00,820
The timing is certainly.

741
00:46:00,820 --> 00:46:03,780
I mean, there's always going to be people that read a lot into the timing, right?

742
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:07,220
Because of all the things that Twitch has gone through in the past year.

743
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:10,980
I think more so the fact that the YouTube CEO just stepped down a couple of weeks ago.

744
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:13,380
That's the one where I'm like, well, that's interesting.

745
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:14,260
But I mean.

746
00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:16,260
He doesn't want to do it, too.

747
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:22,340
It doesn't like any time that he stepped down, there's going to be people trying to read

748
00:46:22,340 --> 00:46:24,580
the tea leaves going, well, what really happened?

749
00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:26,100
Was he forced out?

750
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:26,420
You know?

751
00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:33,700
Well, I mean, it's probably like, you know, the drama that was last year and stuff probably

752
00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:36,820
doesn't hurt as well.

753
00:46:36,820 --> 00:46:40,980
Like, I mean, yeah, it's like, yeah, I'm leaving for a family, but all this other drama, if

754
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:42,660
I could be away from that as well.

755
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:43,060
Cool.

756
00:46:43,620 --> 00:46:43,780
Yeah.

757
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:46,420
It's like a win win there, I guess.

758
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:52,020
Bobby Blackwolf in chat points out Dan Clancy was the president of Twitch and is now the

759
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:52,580
CEO.

760
00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:53,780
He took over immediately.

761
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:57,540
So not a huge changing of the guard to go from president to CEO.

762
00:46:57,540 --> 00:47:00,020
I would not call like a major culture shift.

763
00:47:00,020 --> 00:47:01,940
This isn't like what happened to Twitter.

764
00:47:02,660 --> 00:47:03,860
I'll just leave it at that.

765
00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:09,220
This is just, you know, obviously somebody who is already in a very high role just going

766
00:47:09,220 --> 00:47:10,500
to a different role.

767
00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:15,060
So I wouldn't expect a lot changes as to, you know, what's coming up in the future and

768
00:47:15,060 --> 00:47:15,620
all of that stuff.

769
00:47:15,620 --> 00:47:18,180
It's just kind of one of those things where it's like, oh, this is interesting because,

770
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:23,540
you know, Emmett dates back to the Justin TV days and where Twitch was born and all

771
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:25,620
of this and now is leaving.

772
00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:29,860
But it's hard to stay at a company for even 15 years.

773
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:34,740
I think when you start to get to that point, hell, I was at a job for 14 years and that's

774
00:47:34,740 --> 00:47:39,940
when I finally started to realize that nothing else was ever going to happen if I didn't

775
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:40,740
change companies.

776
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:42,260
And I did.

777
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:43,780
And that's great.

778
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:47,300
You know, and not to say because some people do end up with a company they love and they

779
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:48,980
do stay longer than 14 years.

780
00:47:48,980 --> 00:47:49,860
That's great.

781
00:47:49,860 --> 00:47:55,140
I'm talking about most people, you know, when they invest years and years in a company,

782
00:47:55,140 --> 00:47:57,060
this is the point where they start to kind of look around.

783
00:47:57,060 --> 00:48:00,180
What else do I want to say that I did, you know, professionally?

784
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:02,100
And there's probably some of that going on as well.

785
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:02,660
And that's okay.

786
00:48:02,660 --> 00:48:07,780
There's not much more you can do once you're CEO of the company.

787
00:48:07,780 --> 00:48:08,340
That's right.

788
00:48:08,340 --> 00:48:08,820
That's true.

789
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:14,260
Questbuster says it could also be he just wants to leave the circus behind for a new

790
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:14,980
chapter.

791
00:48:14,980 --> 00:48:19,140
Twitch is constantly under pressure from Amazon to turn a profit, from what I understand,

792
00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:22,820
plus dealing with all the dirty laundry aired over the years about the culture.

793
00:48:22,820 --> 00:48:26,420
SSG100Matt says I've had several co-workers leave right after having a kid.

794
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:28,260
I've heard other folks doing so as well.

795
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:31,140
Having a kid seems to be a transition spot for a lot of folks.

796
00:48:31,140 --> 00:48:31,380
Sure.

797
00:48:32,180 --> 00:48:36,180
Tigerclaw says I remember when Justin TV was doing the real life stuff, then switching

798
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:39,700
to the gaming stuff only to go back to the real life stuff when they wanted more people

799
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:40,180
to join.

800
00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:43,940
Yeah, it's been an interesting journey, this whole thing.

801
00:48:43,940 --> 00:48:46,820
But, you know, here we are all these years later.

802
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:52,260
But I would say just going back to what Questbuster says, I think the interesting thing that could

803
00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:58,980
happen is you might see some other changes to try to monetize this platform a little

804
00:48:58,980 --> 00:48:59,300
more.

805
00:49:00,180 --> 00:49:04,660
And I don't know if that's going to be, people are going to be forced onto an, that's my

806
00:49:04,660 --> 00:49:04,980
worry.

807
00:49:05,060 --> 00:49:06,660
That's always in the back of my head.

808
00:49:06,660 --> 00:49:13,380
So when we tape live here at the Voice of the Geeks Network, I always play ads for a

809
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:16,980
couple of minutes because that's how we get the pre-roll ads turned off.

810
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:20,660
So before we actually start, I play pre-roll ads for a couple of minutes.

811
00:49:20,660 --> 00:49:25,460
So that way for about 40 minutes, no ads actually play, they're off now.

812
00:49:25,460 --> 00:49:29,060
So if people come into the channel, they see ads before they see us.

813
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:34,180
Rob, it's been changed a little bit because when I run, I always start with a three-minute

814
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:39,620
ad for my five-minute intro on my stream and it takes out 62 minutes.

815
00:49:39,620 --> 00:49:40,020
Yes.

816
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:42,500
So they did change it recently.

817
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:46,420
So you used to only be able to do a minute and a half of ads up to 30 minutes.

818
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:49,700
Now you can do three minutes of ads up to 60 minutes.

819
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:51,620
And I do the same on my personal stream.

820
00:49:51,620 --> 00:49:55,700
However, here at VOG, because we're still transitioning between Bobby's show and our

821
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:59,860
show and we don't want people to be stuck in ads too long, I capped it at two minutes.

822
00:49:59,860 --> 00:50:03,300
Two minutes is a normal TV break and that's 40 minutes of pre-roll ads.

823
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:04,900
So that's enough.

824
00:50:05,540 --> 00:50:09,460
And then that way we're not stalling too long between Bobby's show and kind of keeping the

825
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:10,180
things moving here.

826
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:14,660
But yeah, but that whole thing is still optional for broadcasters.

827
00:50:14,660 --> 00:50:19,540
My fear is three minutes of ads an hour is going to become mandatory.

828
00:50:19,540 --> 00:50:24,340
That is my concern because Twitch has no problem if you opt into it, cutting off your fee.

829
00:50:24,340 --> 00:50:26,420
And they're trying to sweeten the deal.

830
00:50:26,420 --> 00:50:29,780
They're trying to get people to opt into it by offering more incentives.

831
00:50:29,780 --> 00:50:30,340
And I get it.

832
00:50:30,340 --> 00:50:31,540
There's a lot of people that are doing it.

833
00:50:32,180 --> 00:50:33,220
You got to do what you got to do.

834
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:37,460
But I feel like Twitch is going to make that mandatory.

835
00:50:37,460 --> 00:50:38,820
I can't help but dread that.

836
00:50:39,380 --> 00:50:40,100
I wish as a-

837
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:42,580
It technically kind of is.

838
00:50:42,580 --> 00:50:48,100
I mean, the ads themselves, they're going to happen whether you want them to or not.

839
00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:48,900
That's true.

840
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:51,620
You can just jump in and take control.

841
00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:54,100
Yes, that's true.

842
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:55,380
When you want to.

843
00:50:55,380 --> 00:50:59,380
And I even, I mean, I have a disclaimer in mind that, hey, if you don't like it, sub

844
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:00,980
or Twitch Turbo.

845
00:51:00,980 --> 00:51:02,020
But still, you know.

846
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:07,460
Tigerclaw in chat says, how long before they set up a subscription where you have to pay

847
00:51:07,460 --> 00:51:08,900
to broadcast on Twitch?

848
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:10,580
I'm going to put this out in the ether.

849
00:51:10,580 --> 00:51:10,980
And I-

850
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:14,980
Bobby's going to kill me when he sees me at Dragon Combat.

851
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:16,980
I'm willing to put this out there.

852
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:24,900
If they wanted to charge VOG Network to broadcast on Twitch ad-free a reasonable amount of money,

853
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:29,060
let's say $19.99 a month, and we could broadcast ad-free, we'd do it.

854
00:51:29,060 --> 00:51:33,300
We have enough support from you guys that come in with the subs and the bits and all

855
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:33,700
that stuff.

856
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:34,820
Again, a reasonable price.

857
00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:36,740
It was like $99.99 a month.

858
00:51:36,740 --> 00:51:37,240
No way.

859
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:38,180
No.

860
00:51:38,180 --> 00:51:42,980
But like if it was $19.99 a month or something, I'd pay it to turn off the ads completely

861
00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:43,860
on this channel.

862
00:51:43,860 --> 00:51:45,220
I'd be willing to do it.

863
00:51:45,220 --> 00:51:45,620
So-

864
00:51:45,620 --> 00:51:52,340
And if it was, Rob, if it was $99.99 a year, that would be actually even better.

865
00:51:52,340 --> 00:51:53,140
Sure, sure.

866
00:51:53,140 --> 00:51:54,340
I'd be willing to do it.

867
00:51:54,340 --> 00:51:54,820
Okay.

868
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:57,300
Bobby says, why would I kill you for something I agree with?

869
00:51:57,620 --> 00:52:00,420
For making a definitive statement without consulting with you first.

870
00:52:00,420 --> 00:52:02,260
But thankfully you agree with me on this one.

871
00:52:06,980 --> 00:52:11,940
But usually I know better than to make definitive statements about the future of VOG Network.

872
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:14,020
By the way, did you know we're going to be getting a new-

873
00:52:14,020 --> 00:52:14,660
No, forget it.

874
00:52:14,660 --> 00:52:15,160
I'm not-

875
00:52:18,340 --> 00:52:18,740
All right.

876
00:52:18,740 --> 00:52:20,740
Y'all are special.

877
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:24,500
But anyway, I would see that as-

878
00:52:25,460 --> 00:52:27,300
Again, I hope Twitch considers that.

879
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:32,340
If they're going to make the ads mandatory, honestly, let me pay a nominal fee to just

880
00:52:32,340 --> 00:52:33,620
dodge all of that shit.

881
00:52:33,620 --> 00:52:35,060
I would be willing to pay it.

882
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:37,300
So because I think-

883
00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:38,100
I think I would too.

884
00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:39,540
Yeah, the support of the-

885
00:52:39,540 --> 00:52:42,660
I don't have a gigantic audience on my personal channel and that's okay.

886
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:43,780
I don't want one.

887
00:52:43,780 --> 00:52:46,580
I have enough support where it would work itself out.

888
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:49,220
I'd essentially be able to broadcast for free, you know?

889
00:52:49,220 --> 00:52:50,260
And I'm okay with that.

890
00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:51,220
That's all I want.

891
00:52:51,220 --> 00:52:52,820
I want a gigantic audience.

892
00:52:53,140 --> 00:52:58,660
Tigerclaw says, now what if you pay the subscription to broadcast on Twitch and part of that subscription

893
00:52:58,660 --> 00:53:01,300
allows you to play music without getting copyright stricken?

894
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:06,260
That would be a very smart thing for Twitch to do.

895
00:53:06,260 --> 00:53:11,460
They should make those deals and allow people to pay money to license the music and do that.

896
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:12,820
That would be fantastic.

897
00:53:12,820 --> 00:53:17,060
I think a lot of people would be very excited about that, especially how this is growing

898
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:21,060
as music in real life and your DJ sets and all that.

899
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:26,100
As it's growing as a platform like that, I think that's actually a great idea.

900
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:31,780
Those agreements are going to be hard to get because the record companies are greedy as fu-

901
00:53:31,780 --> 00:53:32,980
And never going to do it.

902
00:53:32,980 --> 00:53:35,140
And they're never going to do it, but it's nice.

903
00:53:35,140 --> 00:53:37,060
It's not Twitch's fault in that department.

904
00:53:37,060 --> 00:53:41,380
What a bunch of us have to do now is we can still play our music during the live stream

905
00:53:41,380 --> 00:53:43,140
and they don't seem to care.

906
00:53:43,140 --> 00:53:45,140
Yeah, you have to set it OBS a certain way.

907
00:53:45,140 --> 00:53:49,700
Yeah, you just can't have it as a part of your VOD, which kind of gets me in trouble

908
00:53:49,700 --> 00:53:51,700
because I sing along with my music.

909
00:53:51,700 --> 00:53:52,020
Yeah.

910
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:58,020
And one day I accidentally on my personal stream, I did something where I was using

911
00:53:58,020 --> 00:54:02,660
a new scene and I hadn't made the Spotify and the rest of my audio separate on that

912
00:54:02,660 --> 00:54:03,140
scene.

913
00:54:03,140 --> 00:54:06,340
So I actually played it and I got muted like that.

914
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:09,940
But it's not like it's my entire stream.

915
00:54:09,940 --> 00:54:12,100
It's just my opening segment, but it is what it is.

916
00:54:13,540 --> 00:54:19,300
I would like to say for streamers who are on max like me, if you want to know how to

917
00:54:19,380 --> 00:54:22,420
do it on a Mac because it's a little bit more involved, let me know.

918
00:54:22,420 --> 00:54:23,380
I'll help you out.

919
00:54:23,380 --> 00:54:27,300
It's actually not that hard either because we used very similar technology when we were

920
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:29,620
all in the same place using the Mac Mini to broadcast.

921
00:54:30,180 --> 00:54:33,940
That's how we would strip the localized audio out of the feed.

922
00:54:33,940 --> 00:54:36,500
We had to separate it to get it to work, but it worked.

923
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:38,500
Yeah, I used loopback and EQMac.

924
00:54:39,140 --> 00:54:42,500
Yeah, I think loopback is essential.

925
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:43,000
Yeah.

926
00:54:43,940 --> 00:54:45,700
Alrighty, let's move on.

927
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:48,900
Let's talk about another video game that has left.

928
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:54,500
It's exclusive window for the Sony PlayStation, and it's now going to be on its way to Xbox,

929
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:56,500
and that is Ghostwire Tokyo.

930
00:54:57,140 --> 00:54:59,860
Ghostwire Tokyo launched on PC and PlayStation 5.

931
00:54:59,860 --> 00:55:04,820
This was interesting because it was a Bethesda title, but Microsoft bought Bethesda, but

932
00:55:04,820 --> 00:55:07,780
this is one of the ones that still had an exclusive window.

933
00:55:07,780 --> 00:55:13,780
So now that window is up, you bet it's coming to Xbox Series X and S on April 12th.

934
00:55:13,780 --> 00:55:17,620
There will also be new content because, of course, they want to sweeten the pot here.

935
00:55:17,620 --> 00:55:20,420
Now that Bethesda is a Microsoft subsidiary.

936
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:26,420
Tango Game Works made this game notable because they made The Evil Within and have had a lot

937
00:55:26,420 --> 00:55:28,420
of success this year with Hi-Fi Rush.

938
00:55:28,420 --> 00:55:34,340
So Ghostwire Tokyo was also one of their games, and this is where you're going around Tokyo

939
00:55:34,340 --> 00:55:36,180
and it's a supernatural sort of thing.

940
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:38,020
We wanted to play this.

941
00:55:38,020 --> 00:55:38,660
Yeah.

942
00:55:38,660 --> 00:55:42,740
The reviews were a little mixed at launch because they were saying that the combat was a little

943
00:55:42,740 --> 00:55:46,340
same-sy and there was some mechanical building blocks that were recycled, but some people

944
00:55:46,340 --> 00:55:47,300
were really into it.

945
00:55:47,300 --> 00:55:52,180
And some people think that Japan's folklore that plays into the story is done very well.

946
00:55:52,180 --> 00:55:54,180
So there's, you know, there's kind of mixed.

947
00:55:54,180 --> 00:55:56,500
Mixed means some really liked it and some didn't.

948
00:55:58,180 --> 00:56:03,700
Yeah, Eurogamer in one of their reviews said, I can say that dull combat aside, exploring

949
00:56:03,700 --> 00:56:05,460
Shibuya never bores.

950
00:56:05,460 --> 00:56:06,900
So there's that.

951
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:11,940
Anyway, Game Pass will have the games as well on the 12th of April, and there will be new

952
00:56:11,940 --> 00:56:12,500
content.

953
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:14,500
It's called the Spider's Thread update.

954
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:16,660
That's extended scenes for the main story.

955
00:56:16,660 --> 00:56:19,780
New locations to explore, including a school area.

956
00:56:19,780 --> 00:56:21,140
Oh, we love a spooky school.

957
00:56:21,860 --> 00:56:26,900
And new enemies like the Silent Gays, the Sanguine Dancer, and Retribution.

958
00:56:27,460 --> 00:56:28,740
There's also new skills.

959
00:56:28,740 --> 00:56:34,580
I thought you said Silent Gays, and I'm like, no one I've ever met has been silent.

960
00:56:34,580 --> 00:56:37,140
G-A-Z-E, Dar Sakura.

961
00:56:37,140 --> 00:56:41,140
I know, I thought of it afterwards, but that's the image that popped into my head.

962
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:46,980
I was like, and then my brain went, it's the gay version of Silent Hill.

963
00:56:48,980 --> 00:56:51,380
There's new skills coming as well.

964
00:56:51,380 --> 00:56:52,020
No, I love it.

965
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:56,180
Anyway, coming out for the Xbox on April 12th.

966
00:56:56,180 --> 00:57:01,060
Not surprised at all to see that, you know, now that this Bethesda, you know, signed before

967
00:57:01,060 --> 00:57:05,220
they were bought by Microsoft, it's getting a little enhanced and, you know, there'll

968
00:57:05,220 --> 00:57:07,140
probably be more people to check it out this time around.

969
00:57:07,140 --> 00:57:08,740
It's going to be very interesting.

970
00:57:08,740 --> 00:57:13,380
So we'll see, maybe the game will get a second peak or something like that.

971
00:57:13,380 --> 00:57:14,500
So, all right.

972
00:57:15,220 --> 00:57:18,180
Let's move on and talk about this next story.

973
00:57:18,180 --> 00:57:20,500
This is always an interesting time of year, right, Dar Sakura?

974
00:57:22,020 --> 00:57:30,740
Yeah, we are coming up on the Video Game Hall of Fame voting and ballots and things.

975
00:57:30,740 --> 00:57:32,180
Who's going to get in there?

976
00:57:33,460 --> 00:57:36,900
We have the 12 finalists right now.

977
00:57:37,860 --> 00:57:44,900
There's Age of Empires, Angry Birds, Barbie Fashion Designer, Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare,

978
00:57:44,900 --> 00:57:50,420
Computer Space, FIFA International Soccer, GoldenEye 007, the one that makes me motion

979
00:57:50,420 --> 00:57:56,020
sick, The Last of Us, NBA 2K, Quake, Wii Sports, and Wizardry.

980
00:57:57,140 --> 00:58:01,860
Now, it's pretty hard to narrow down.

981
00:58:01,860 --> 00:58:02,900
I mean, there's a few on these.

982
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:04,580
I'm like, no, they don't know.

983
00:58:04,580 --> 00:58:07,060
Yeah, there's some I could definitely take off.

984
00:58:07,060 --> 00:58:12,180
But there's some on the list that I would think are kind of middling.

985
00:58:12,820 --> 00:58:16,340
And then there's some I think definitely have a place there.

986
00:58:16,340 --> 00:58:19,780
You know, I could make a list.

987
00:58:21,220 --> 00:58:27,540
But as far as, you know, the thing about the games is that these are games that are supposed

988
00:58:27,540 --> 00:58:32,900
to have had a big influence on the popular culture of the video game industry.

989
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:38,820
Notable for different things like, I mean, there's a very big reason Barbie Fashion Designer

990
00:58:38,820 --> 00:58:39,300
is on there.

991
00:58:39,300 --> 00:58:41,140
You may go, oh, it's a Barbie game.

992
00:58:41,140 --> 00:58:51,300
But it was one of the first games marketed to female gamers, you know, to break that

993
00:58:51,300 --> 00:58:55,620
sort of hold that the industry had of only marketing to male gamers.

994
00:58:57,300 --> 00:59:01,620
You know, Wii Sports, we know why that's on there because it brought in an older crowd.

995
00:59:01,860 --> 00:59:10,420
You know, Computer Space was one of the first arcade releases, 1971.

996
00:59:10,420 --> 00:59:16,900
I might have almost done this game before, but it was basically taking these types of

997
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:20,660
games out of, you know, people's computer labs, pretty much.

998
00:59:22,340 --> 00:59:25,940
You know, we've got all sorts of notoriety.

999
00:59:25,940 --> 00:59:30,740
And of course, there's always the fan voting that's online through March 22nd.

1000
00:59:30,820 --> 00:59:32,660
So we only have a couple more days.

1001
00:59:32,660 --> 00:59:34,820
And that's the player's choice ballot.

1002
00:59:34,820 --> 00:59:40,180
The ones with the most public votes from one ballot will be counted alongside the ballot

1003
00:59:40,180 --> 00:59:43,540
submitted by members of the committee of experts.

1004
00:59:43,540 --> 00:59:47,940
And then they will be conducted in a virtual ceremony on May 4th.

1005
00:59:48,740 --> 00:59:53,700
Well, Dark Sakura, since you mentioned you could make a list, let's put that to the test

1006
00:59:53,700 --> 00:59:55,460
here live on air.

1007
00:59:55,460 --> 00:59:58,340
And so what we've done, we've actually taken those 12.

1008
00:59:58,420 --> 01:00:04,660
My very high technological WordPad document live on air, we've actually taken the 12 games

1009
01:00:04,660 --> 01:00:09,460
and I'd like us now, kind of as hosts here, we're going to each go around and pick the

1010
01:00:09,460 --> 01:00:12,820
five that we would vote for and why.

1011
01:00:12,820 --> 01:00:16,020
So in other words, which of these queens should go home tonight and why?

1012
01:00:16,020 --> 01:00:20,580
No, which five games would you move into?

1013
01:00:20,580 --> 01:00:24,180
So it's kind of an interesting version of listless where we're changing the rules a

1014
01:00:24,180 --> 01:00:27,780
little bit, but we're doing it the way they're going to vote.

1015
01:00:27,780 --> 01:00:31,220
So which five would you keep and why?

1016
01:00:31,220 --> 01:00:33,300
So I'll start with Dark Sakura.

1017
01:00:34,260 --> 01:00:34,760
Okay.

1018
01:00:35,460 --> 01:00:42,980
So, and I will admit I had honorable mentions like Goldeneye was an honorable mention, but

1019
01:00:42,980 --> 01:00:50,100
I actually started with Barbie Fashion Designer because of the marketing behind it.

1020
01:00:50,660 --> 01:00:52,260
It really did break a mold.

1021
01:00:52,260 --> 01:00:56,980
It was fully marketed toward a completely different demographic than what had normally

1022
01:00:56,980 --> 01:00:59,460
been advertised to and it belongs on there.

1023
01:01:00,980 --> 01:01:01,620
Last of Us.

1024
01:01:02,420 --> 01:01:09,620
Number one, that game has had a pretty massive cultural impact and in the years that it's

1025
01:01:09,620 --> 01:01:14,900
been out, we've got a TV show based on it that I understand is really good.

1026
01:01:14,900 --> 01:01:18,020
I need to marathon it when I can ugly cry by myself.

1027
01:01:18,020 --> 01:01:21,060
And yes, both of those games made me super ugly cry.

1028
01:01:21,620 --> 01:01:26,260
They, it tackled some very important, you know, social issues in it.

1029
01:01:26,820 --> 01:01:31,700
And honestly enough, it's a game that has that lasting power.

1030
01:01:31,700 --> 01:01:32,980
It's an instant classic.

1031
01:01:34,660 --> 01:01:42,180
I'm going to then go to Quake because not just because of what Quake is as an FPS, because

1032
01:01:42,180 --> 01:01:49,620
we had others before that, you know, we had Doom, we had Hexen, but Quake was really the

1033
01:01:49,620 --> 01:01:54,980
one that I think brought it out of a more niche area.

1034
01:01:54,980 --> 01:02:03,220
And on top of that, the modding, all the mods and we've got, you know, so many references

1035
01:02:03,220 --> 01:02:08,660
in pop culture to Quake, not to mention we have MC Hawkings with Quake Master, just saying.

1036
01:02:10,020 --> 01:02:13,220
So I think that Quake definitely belongs on the list.

1037
01:02:14,820 --> 01:02:17,940
Wizardry, I put it on there because it's a classic.

1038
01:02:18,740 --> 01:02:25,380
It spawned so many sequels and it's been sort of like a granddaddy of that genre.

1039
01:02:27,060 --> 01:02:30,900
And then last I added computer space for the reasons before.

1040
01:02:30,900 --> 01:02:34,260
It was an early public arcade title.

1041
01:02:34,260 --> 01:02:37,860
It had that yellow twisty looking cabinet with the...

1042
01:02:38,420 --> 01:02:45,860
It looked very 70's chic, you know, I think it was great, but it brought those games out

1043
01:02:45,860 --> 01:02:53,060
of, you know, basically the nerd caves, you know, those old IBM's and brought it out into

1044
01:02:53,060 --> 01:02:58,180
the public eye, you know, sitting there amongst the pinball tables and, you know, pre-Space

1045
01:02:58,180 --> 01:03:00,500
Invaders, you know, if I recall correctly.

1046
01:03:01,140 --> 01:03:10,020
So that one, I think, if not for computer space, we might not have had stuff like Space

1047
01:03:10,100 --> 01:03:16,340
Invaders and Galaga Galaxian, you know, all of those sorts of games.

1048
01:03:16,340 --> 01:03:20,420
I think that these are all notable for those reasons.

1049
01:03:20,420 --> 01:03:21,220
All right.

1050
01:03:21,220 --> 01:03:25,140
So we've put some gold stars up by the ones that Dark Sakura has named.

1051
01:03:25,140 --> 01:03:26,580
So Loki, let's go over to you.

1052
01:03:26,580 --> 01:03:30,740
What would be the five from this list that you would induct into the Hall of Fame?

1053
01:03:31,860 --> 01:03:32,260
Let's see.

1054
01:03:32,260 --> 01:03:39,140
I would probably do Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare since it basically set the gold standard

1055
01:03:39,220 --> 01:03:42,340
for modern FPS shooter games.

1056
01:03:42,340 --> 01:03:47,460
I mean, it was really pivotal, considering that the first three Call of Duty games are

1057
01:03:47,460 --> 01:03:51,460
all World War II games, then they pivoted to it and who would have thought that it would

1058
01:03:51,460 --> 01:03:53,220
have been extremely popular?

1059
01:03:53,220 --> 01:03:55,380
So for sure, Call of Duty.

1060
01:03:56,180 --> 01:04:01,220
Then I'd probably do Mirror Quake because, you know, it's one of the first polygonal

1061
01:04:02,100 --> 01:04:03,220
FPS games.

1062
01:04:03,220 --> 01:04:09,380
It's just a really awesome game that basically, you know, helped propel the genre forward.

1063
01:04:10,100 --> 01:04:10,660
Wii Sports.

1064
01:04:12,900 --> 01:04:15,140
Yeah, I mean, they have that as well, I guess.

1065
01:04:15,700 --> 01:04:18,100
I don't know if I'd Hall of Fame that part.

1066
01:04:19,620 --> 01:04:21,380
You were starting to say Wii Sports, Loki?

1067
01:04:21,380 --> 01:04:26,660
Yeah, Wii Sports because it made games more accessible and brought in a whole bunch of

1068
01:04:26,660 --> 01:04:28,500
people that wouldn't normally play games.

1069
01:04:30,260 --> 01:04:30,900
Let's see.

1070
01:04:30,980 --> 01:04:40,580
I would say probably Goldeneye because I know that was a very popular multiplayer game.

1071
01:04:40,580 --> 01:04:45,220
Definitely pushed split screen multiplayer quite a bit.

1072
01:04:46,020 --> 01:04:49,860
I think it really also pushed the capabilities of the N64.

1073
01:04:49,860 --> 01:04:52,180
That's why I almost put it on my list.

1074
01:04:52,180 --> 01:04:52,980
Yeah, for sure.

1075
01:04:53,300 --> 01:05:01,140
I guess I'm not familiar with Wizardry.

1076
01:05:03,460 --> 01:05:08,900
I guess Computer Space because it's one of the, you know, the earlier arcade games.

1077
01:05:08,900 --> 01:05:11,300
So that's definitely pivotal as well.

1078
01:05:12,340 --> 01:05:14,020
Anyway, I got one more left.

1079
01:05:14,020 --> 01:05:15,060
Nope, that was it.

1080
01:05:15,060 --> 01:05:15,300
Nope.

1081
01:05:15,300 --> 01:05:17,380
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

1082
01:05:17,380 --> 01:05:18,820
Yep, there's ten stars up on the board.

1083
01:05:18,820 --> 01:05:21,060
So now we're going to me.

1084
01:05:21,060 --> 01:05:21,700
All right.

1085
01:05:21,700 --> 01:05:23,460
So here's what I would do.

1086
01:05:24,020 --> 01:05:28,820
I would say number one, by far the biggest one on this list for me, you know, everybody

1087
01:05:28,820 --> 01:05:29,300
has opinions.

1088
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:30,020
That's fine for me.

1089
01:05:30,020 --> 01:05:33,140
The biggest one on this list that deserves to be in the Hall of Fame is Wii Sports.

1090
01:05:33,700 --> 01:05:39,940
I think when history looks back on what gaming was in the aughts, I think, you know, Wii

1091
01:05:39,940 --> 01:05:46,500
and everything that this game did for pushing an entire platform forward and really selling

1092
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:49,940
Nintendo's, you know, silly named console and all that forward.

1093
01:05:49,940 --> 01:05:53,300
I think Wii Sports is going to be seen as pivotal for that.

1094
01:05:54,180 --> 01:05:56,900
Number two on my list, I would say Quake, actually.

1095
01:05:56,900 --> 01:05:59,140
So that's one that all three of us are going to end up saying.

1096
01:05:59,700 --> 01:06:02,340
I think you have several shooters that are represented on this list.

1097
01:06:02,340 --> 01:06:06,420
I think Quake is the one, again, it really defined an era of PC gaming.

1098
01:06:06,420 --> 01:06:10,660
And I think, you know, as was already brought up, the mods, especially when you consider

1099
01:06:10,660 --> 01:06:17,780
things like Team Fortress that then turned into their own things, I think is huge.

1100
01:06:17,780 --> 01:06:19,380
So I think Quake, absolutely.

1101
01:06:19,940 --> 01:06:24,500
It looks like that's the only one all three of us are probably going to say is one of

1102
01:06:24,500 --> 01:06:25,780
the huge ones in the list.

1103
01:06:27,060 --> 01:06:27,780
Other titles.

1104
01:06:28,660 --> 01:06:34,900
I would say The Last of Us might be a little bit early.

1105
01:06:34,900 --> 01:06:39,220
And I understand maybe some of the concerns with that, with The Last of Us.

1106
01:06:39,220 --> 01:06:46,180
But I do think that, especially with the success of the TV show, and I think when people kind

1107
01:06:46,180 --> 01:06:50,980
of look back on gaming and TV and all that medium and stuff, I think The Last of Us is

1108
01:06:50,980 --> 01:06:52,580
going to hold up very strong.

1109
01:06:52,580 --> 01:06:57,060
So I think as far as like a strong contemporary choice, The Last of Us would definitely be

1110
01:06:57,060 --> 01:06:57,620
on my list.

1111
01:06:58,820 --> 01:07:00,340
So that was one, two, three.

1112
01:07:00,340 --> 01:07:05,060
So number four for me, I'm actually going to say Wizardry.

1113
01:07:05,060 --> 01:07:13,380
I think, again, there's really an era of early PC gaming that Wizardry really influenced.

1114
01:07:13,380 --> 01:07:19,060
And I think as far as we look at role playing games as they were developed by Japanese companies

1115
01:07:19,060 --> 01:07:23,460
and role playing games as they were developed by American companies, Wizardry was really

1116
01:07:24,100 --> 01:07:31,540
the roots of where the American developed ones kind of ended up going as a result.

1117
01:07:32,260 --> 01:07:36,740
And then the last one I would put on my list, and this may surprise you, I'm actually not

1118
01:07:36,740 --> 01:07:38,100
going to go with what you think.

1119
01:07:38,100 --> 01:07:40,740
And I'm going to put Barbie Fashion Designer as my number five.

1120
01:07:41,700 --> 01:07:46,100
I think kind of as Dark Sakura already kind of hit on the main points of that, as much

1121
01:07:46,100 --> 01:07:51,460
as you might look at that and go, LOL Barbie, I think it's important to note that, again,

1122
01:07:51,460 --> 01:07:59,220
this was the game industry acknowledging that there were more people that games needed to

1123
01:07:59,220 --> 01:08:05,620
be accessible to and open to and targeted to, to bring into the gaming world.

1124
01:08:05,780 --> 01:08:11,300
And I think really just set, again, a standard for an entire genre of

1125
01:08:12,020 --> 01:08:16,260
Nancy Drew type games and things that followed it in the PC era.

1126
01:08:16,260 --> 01:08:17,460
So those are my five.

1127
01:08:17,460 --> 01:08:18,260
It's very tropey.

1128
01:08:18,820 --> 01:08:19,780
Yeah, yeah.

1129
01:08:19,780 --> 01:08:21,540
I mean, it's very tropey.

1130
01:08:21,540 --> 01:08:24,340
But again, it's the Nith event.

1131
01:08:24,980 --> 01:08:25,700
Significant.

1132
01:08:25,700 --> 01:08:26,420
It's significant.

1133
01:08:27,380 --> 01:08:27,780
Yeah.

1134
01:08:27,780 --> 01:08:32,740
And in my opinion, FIFA and NBA 2K should never be in the Hall of Fame ever because

1135
01:08:32,740 --> 01:08:38,740
of the crap that they perpetuated in this industry, the absolute vile monetization

1136
01:08:38,740 --> 01:08:41,780
practices that are FIFA Ultimate Team.

1137
01:08:42,900 --> 01:08:44,020
To hell with that series.

1138
01:08:44,020 --> 01:08:48,980
I'm sorry, but they put FIFA 23 as the box art, you know, so they're representing their

1139
01:08:48,980 --> 01:08:51,700
most recent game as Hall of Fame worthy.

1140
01:08:51,700 --> 01:08:52,340
No way.

1141
01:08:52,340 --> 01:08:53,860
That is never going to make it in there.

1142
01:08:53,860 --> 01:09:00,260
And the NBA 2K is just as bad, you know, with the monetization and just the half-assed

1143
01:09:00,260 --> 01:09:04,420
development on these games churning out the same thing year after year.

1144
01:09:04,420 --> 01:09:04,900
No, thanks.

1145
01:09:04,900 --> 01:09:06,660
That does not belong in the Hall of Fame.

1146
01:09:06,660 --> 01:09:07,220
I would agree.

1147
01:09:07,940 --> 01:09:10,020
But Dalton, in support, tell us how you really feel.

1148
01:09:10,020 --> 01:09:13,620
And honestly, for me, the only reason I didn't say Call of Duty and GoldenEye is that you

1149
01:09:13,620 --> 01:09:17,620
already had another shooter on there and pretty much all that's left after that is you have

1150
01:09:17,620 --> 01:09:19,460
Angry Birds and Age of Empires.

1151
01:09:19,460 --> 01:09:21,460
There's nothing wrong with either of those games, certainly.

1152
01:09:21,460 --> 01:09:26,580
And again, I think Age of Empires also speaks certainly to a very distinct genre of game

1153
01:09:27,140 --> 01:09:29,380
I think is already represented in the Hall of Fame.

1154
01:09:29,380 --> 01:09:32,020
But I understand Age of Empires significance.

1155
01:09:32,020 --> 01:09:35,140
It's just, you know, you have to pick five from the 12 and that's just when it falls

1156
01:09:35,140 --> 01:09:35,700
by the wayside.

1157
01:09:35,700 --> 01:09:37,540
It's a similar thing with Angry Birds.

1158
01:09:37,540 --> 01:09:43,140
I understand that Angry Birds, as far as mobile titles go, is hugely significant.

1159
01:09:43,140 --> 01:09:46,980
And with the movies and everything and the marketing and everything else, I get it.

1160
01:09:46,980 --> 01:09:50,100
But I just don't know if I look back on that game fondly.

1161
01:09:50,900 --> 01:09:55,860
My thing about Angry Birds, why I think it is on the list, not just for what you were

1162
01:09:55,860 --> 01:10:03,700
saying, is because it spawned a whole, I would say, push for the casual gamer in gaming culture.

1163
01:10:05,300 --> 01:10:06,580
You know, the mobile gamer.

1164
01:10:06,580 --> 01:10:11,220
And on top of that, it turned into a massive merchandising empire.

1165
01:10:11,780 --> 01:10:16,100
You know, if anything, I would say that the Angry Birds franchise is one of the biggest

1166
01:10:16,100 --> 01:10:24,260
ones to sort of show about the influence of video games and merchandising in selling,

1167
01:10:25,060 --> 01:10:28,660
you know, plushies and shirts and movies.

1168
01:10:28,660 --> 01:10:32,580
And that's where I think there's notability there.

1169
01:10:34,420 --> 01:10:38,180
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, to me, the Hall of Fame isn't about what you think of fondly.

1170
01:10:38,180 --> 01:10:40,580
It is more about what's influential in the gaming.

1171
01:10:40,580 --> 01:10:43,140
And Angry Birds was huge with both of my parents.

1172
01:10:43,140 --> 01:10:46,260
It's the only game they played because it was accessible to them in their 70s.

1173
01:10:46,980 --> 01:10:48,420
Respect that viewpoint.

1174
01:10:48,420 --> 01:10:51,300
I stand by my choices under the criteria that you provided.

1175
01:10:52,020 --> 01:10:55,460
So, and everybody's going to look at that differently because everybody has their own

1176
01:10:55,460 --> 01:10:56,260
little anecdotes.

1177
01:10:56,900 --> 01:11:00,420
Wizardry, I think, looking at chat and just looking at the general comments in there,

1178
01:11:00,420 --> 01:11:06,260
I think a lot of people that probably played it sort of kind of, and other people have

1179
01:11:06,260 --> 01:11:06,820
never played it.

1180
01:11:06,820 --> 01:11:08,900
And so that maybe they don't understand why it's influential.

1181
01:11:08,900 --> 01:11:09,380
And I get it.

1182
01:11:09,380 --> 01:11:10,980
And I'm not faulting anyone for it.

1183
01:11:10,980 --> 01:11:13,860
You know, it's just everybody's experiences is different a little bit, right?

1184
01:11:13,860 --> 01:11:21,060
So anyway, let's take a look and see what we decided as show hosts should be the top

1185
01:11:21,060 --> 01:11:21,460
five.

1186
01:11:21,460 --> 01:11:24,420
And it looks like we actually kind of have a top six.

1187
01:11:24,420 --> 01:11:26,900
It looks like the one we're all in agreement on is Quake.

1188
01:11:26,900 --> 01:11:28,900
So Quake definitely makes the list.

1189
01:11:29,540 --> 01:11:35,540
And then from there, you kind of have a five-way tie between Barbie Fashion Designer,

1190
01:11:36,260 --> 01:11:46,980
Computer Space, Last of Us, Wii Sports, and Wizardry kind of all barely make the list

1191
01:11:46,980 --> 01:11:47,300
there.

1192
01:11:47,300 --> 01:11:51,540
So it would come down to those choices for us here at Orange Lounge Radio.

1193
01:11:51,540 --> 01:11:53,140
So that was fun.

1194
01:11:53,140 --> 01:11:58,180
I just also think it's very interesting hearing what we all think of these selections

1195
01:11:58,180 --> 01:11:59,620
by going through a list like this.

1196
01:12:01,060 --> 01:12:06,660
You know, it goes to show that different games mean different things to different people.

1197
01:12:06,660 --> 01:12:07,380
Yeah, yeah.

1198
01:12:07,380 --> 01:12:12,820
But when you can see the commonality amongst, you know, why we would choose what we chose,

1199
01:12:13,700 --> 01:12:16,900
you know, it also speaks to how games can bring people together.

1200
01:12:16,900 --> 01:12:18,660
Yeah, for sure, for sure.

1201
01:12:19,780 --> 01:12:26,420
Also, I had to link that to my friend Annie of Saver and Stuff Bomb Never Told You because

1202
01:12:26,420 --> 01:12:28,180
I know she's going to vote for Last of Us.

1203
01:12:29,700 --> 01:12:33,620
SSJ100Matt says, Loki and Rob have a point and I agree about the monetization stuff,

1204
01:12:33,620 --> 01:12:36,580
but I do think there is a place for licensed sports games.

1205
01:12:36,580 --> 01:12:40,340
Sure, if it was NHL 93, I would have put it in my five.

1206
01:12:40,340 --> 01:12:42,420
If it was NBA Jam, I would have put it in my five.

1207
01:12:42,900 --> 01:12:47,860
If they had represented those by like a certain version of the game, you know, an earlier

1208
01:12:47,860 --> 01:12:49,220
one prior to all this stuff.

1209
01:12:49,220 --> 01:12:51,540
Yeah, I would be on board with that for sure.

1210
01:12:51,540 --> 01:12:58,020
But they represented it with the most recent box art and that could be just the decision

1211
01:12:58,020 --> 01:12:59,060
of the article or whatever.

1212
01:12:59,060 --> 01:13:03,860
But if you're represented by the most recent version, then I'm sorry, I'm not going to

1213
01:13:03,860 --> 01:13:05,860
agree that that should be a Hall of Fame material.

1214
01:13:05,860 --> 01:13:06,360
Yeah.

1215
01:13:07,220 --> 01:13:07,720
All right.

1216
01:13:08,500 --> 01:13:11,300
But everybody, everybody can have their perspective.

1217
01:13:11,300 --> 01:13:15,300
And so it will be interesting to see what the five end up actually being.

1218
01:13:15,300 --> 01:13:19,620
I think even though it didn't make our list, I do think Angry Birds makes the actual top

1219
01:13:19,620 --> 01:13:19,940
five.

1220
01:13:19,940 --> 01:13:20,660
I really do.

1221
01:13:20,660 --> 01:13:24,980
I just I think voters will put like, again, it's how I would have voted.

1222
01:13:24,980 --> 01:13:30,340
I think the way voters will vote, I think it'll be Angry Birds, Wii Sports, Last of

1223
01:13:30,340 --> 01:13:30,900
Us, Quake.

1224
01:13:30,900 --> 01:13:32,420
I think those are all shoo-ins.

1225
01:13:32,420 --> 01:13:34,340
The fifth one is going to be the wild card for me.

1226
01:13:34,340 --> 01:13:40,740
I'm not sure if something like Computer Space gets in there or Wizardry or maybe surprises

1227
01:13:40,740 --> 01:13:42,100
me and it is one of the sports titles.

1228
01:13:42,100 --> 01:13:42,900
I don't know.

1229
01:13:42,900 --> 01:13:43,460
So we'll see.

1230
01:13:44,420 --> 01:13:50,260
Really don't see how Computer Space couldn't make it in given, you know, we've got, quote,

1231
01:13:50,260 --> 01:13:51,780
experts voting on this.

1232
01:13:52,980 --> 01:13:58,100
And, and I mean, if, if you're, you know, people who have been prominent in the industry

1233
01:13:58,100 --> 01:14:03,060
and have followed the trends and hopefully would be sort of our same generation or maybe

1234
01:14:03,060 --> 01:14:06,420
even older, they might understand why something like that would belong in there.

1235
01:14:06,420 --> 01:14:14,420
So I'm, I'm really hoping that, that we have that love given to our, our quote for parent

1236
01:14:14,420 --> 01:14:15,460
games, you know?

1237
01:14:16,340 --> 01:14:17,380
So, all right.

1238
01:14:18,100 --> 01:14:19,220
Well, let's move on.

1239
01:14:19,220 --> 01:14:26,020
Let's move on to the next story, which we'll talk a little bit about maybe the future of

1240
01:14:26,020 --> 01:14:27,220
games a little bit.

1241
01:14:27,220 --> 01:14:31,380
Although there's a little bit of what's old is new again in this, but I'll let Loki talk

1242
01:14:31,380 --> 01:14:33,540
about it and then kind of say what I have to say on this.

1243
01:14:34,260 --> 01:14:34,500
Yeah.

1244
01:14:34,500 --> 01:14:40,900
So they've got this new Fortnite Unreal Editor or Unreal Editor for Fortnite.

1245
01:14:40,900 --> 01:14:46,500
It's a PC app that's designed for developing and publishing games and experiences directly

1246
01:14:46,500 --> 01:14:47,860
into Fortnite.

1247
01:14:47,860 --> 01:14:53,140
They say that with many Unreal, many of Unreal 5's powerful tools and workflows at your

1248
01:14:53,140 --> 01:14:58,820
fingertips, including custom asset import, modeling materials, VFX, Sequencer, and controller,

1249
01:14:58,820 --> 01:15:03,460
you'll have a whole new world of options for publishing games and experiences for Fortnite.

1250
01:15:04,340 --> 01:15:09,540
And it sounds to me a little bit like almost like kind of a Roblox type thing.

1251
01:15:09,540 --> 01:15:15,060
This also sounds very similar to, and I can't remember now the name of the platform that

1252
01:15:15,060 --> 01:15:19,540
they have, but it's also Unreal Engine based where you could build your own games out of

1253
01:15:19,540 --> 01:15:21,700
kind of assets and stuff that they had as well.

1254
01:15:22,580 --> 01:15:27,620
I don't know if that platform ever took off well, but I can imagine tying the Fortnite

1255
01:15:27,620 --> 01:15:29,940
brand to it could be interesting.

1256
01:15:29,940 --> 01:15:36,740
And also what exactly comes out of this, if they're going to try to like, you know, morph

1257
01:15:36,740 --> 01:15:40,180
Fortnite into kind of like a Roblox type of thing.

1258
01:15:40,180 --> 01:15:42,740
I mean, could be neat, I guess.

1259
01:15:44,420 --> 01:15:50,660
They're going to have all sorts of licensing problems like they did with like Roblox does

1260
01:15:50,660 --> 01:15:52,420
or just lets it run rampant.

1261
01:15:52,420 --> 01:15:56,260
But there's some interesting stuff coming out of like Roblox, at least.

1262
01:15:56,820 --> 01:15:59,860
I know my kids have been playing this game called Frontline.

1263
01:15:59,860 --> 01:16:04,660
That's kind of a Call of Duty Modern Warfare shooter game that's in there that doesn't

1264
01:16:04,660 --> 01:16:06,420
look like Roblox, which is kind of cool.

1265
01:16:07,940 --> 01:16:12,260
I'm curious to see what type of non-gaming art pieces because, you know, in Fortnite,

1266
01:16:12,260 --> 01:16:16,980
we've seen interesting things like the concerts, the launches of other media in there.

1267
01:16:16,980 --> 01:16:20,100
I always refer to the Ariana Grande concert, but it really like that was the thing that

1268
01:16:20,100 --> 01:16:25,540
got me to look at Fortnite and go, oh, wow, this really is kind of something different.

1269
01:16:25,860 --> 01:16:27,620
It's not just shooty bang bang.

1270
01:16:27,620 --> 01:16:29,780
It's like interactive art piece.

1271
01:16:29,780 --> 01:16:34,340
I'm excited to see that type of stuff from like indie artists that maybe tap into this

1272
01:16:34,340 --> 01:16:35,700
and use this a little bit.

1273
01:16:35,700 --> 01:16:37,140
I think it'd be very interesting.

1274
01:16:37,140 --> 01:16:40,420
Yeah, I'd be curious how it actually works, though.

1275
01:16:40,420 --> 01:16:41,620
Yeah, I would too.

1276
01:16:41,620 --> 01:16:42,900
Yeah, I'm very curious.

1277
01:16:42,900 --> 01:16:47,220
But also, and the reason why I set up the story kind of funky is because, of course,

1278
01:16:47,220 --> 01:16:52,580
Epic Games, Grandpa's always going to bring up ZZT, which I've brought up a lot on this

1279
01:16:52,580 --> 01:16:55,940
show, especially we talk about, you know, Tim Sweeney's start in the industry.

1280
01:16:55,940 --> 01:17:01,140
I'm not a fan of a lot of his shit now, but certainly back in the day in the 90s when

1281
01:17:01,140 --> 01:17:03,700
he was making ZZT, like that game was legendary.

1282
01:17:03,700 --> 01:17:05,460
And you might remember ZZT.

1283
01:17:05,460 --> 01:17:06,420
Why was it popular?

1284
01:17:06,420 --> 01:17:11,300
Because it brought this whole ZZT OOP object oriented programming language where you could

1285
01:17:11,300 --> 01:17:12,580
make your own games.

1286
01:17:12,580 --> 01:17:16,020
And we saw some really cool shit in ZZT back in the day.

1287
01:17:16,020 --> 01:17:20,820
And that's why to me, it's like, this is fascinating how this has come full circle.

1288
01:17:20,820 --> 01:17:23,620
And essentially, ZZT is coming to Fortnite.

1289
01:17:24,180 --> 01:17:29,540
Actually, I would love to see somebody build ZZT in Fortnite, and I think it'll happen.

1290
01:17:30,100 --> 01:17:33,460
But you still have a programming language.

1291
01:17:33,460 --> 01:17:36,100
It may not be ZZT OOP, but now it's unreal.

1292
01:17:36,740 --> 01:17:38,260
Probably like C++.

1293
01:17:38,260 --> 01:17:42,420
Yeah, that's now going to allow people to make their own stuff in Fortnite.

1294
01:17:42,420 --> 01:17:44,180
And it could be very interesting.

1295
01:17:44,180 --> 01:17:48,420
I've been watching a lot more Fortnite because Alan's been getting into it more.

1296
01:17:48,420 --> 01:17:50,100
He streams it occasionally.

1297
01:17:50,100 --> 01:17:54,100
He kind of prefers his mod games, but I watch over his shoulder sometimes.

1298
01:17:54,100 --> 01:17:56,020
And Fortnite, it's interesting.

1299
01:17:56,020 --> 01:17:59,060
It's still going after all this time.

1300
01:17:59,060 --> 01:18:04,580
And especially the no build mode is great for people like me that just think the building

1301
01:18:04,580 --> 01:18:07,060
adds something to the game that doesn't need to be there.

1302
01:18:07,060 --> 01:18:10,980
But yeah, it's great.

1303
01:18:10,980 --> 01:18:15,460
So I'm very curious to see what this Unreal editor brings, especially when it comes to

1304
01:18:15,460 --> 01:18:16,900
non-gaming experiences.

1305
01:18:16,900 --> 01:18:18,820
Yeah, it comes out in the 22nd.

1306
01:18:18,820 --> 01:18:19,780
I think it's for free.

1307
01:18:20,020 --> 01:18:22,580
So check it out, I guess, if you're interested.

1308
01:18:23,220 --> 01:18:23,720
All right.

1309
01:18:24,660 --> 01:18:28,980
Before I get to the next story, I noticed Dark Sakura's cat has entered the chat.

1310
01:18:28,980 --> 01:18:31,300
Would Midna care to comment on any of the stories tonight?

1311
01:18:32,100 --> 01:18:33,140
You have anything to say?

1312
01:18:35,060 --> 01:18:35,700
Put me down.

1313
01:18:38,260 --> 01:18:39,540
Did you hear the grunt?

1314
01:18:39,540 --> 01:18:40,180
I did.

1315
01:18:40,180 --> 01:18:40,740
I did.

1316
01:18:40,740 --> 01:18:41,300
That's great.

1317
01:18:43,460 --> 01:18:47,380
She's just mad because I picked her up and she's like, mother, no.

1318
01:18:47,380 --> 01:18:47,880
I tried to.

1319
01:18:48,660 --> 01:18:49,160
No.

1320
01:18:49,480 --> 01:18:53,480
I tried to pick up Cheddar earlier and I had him on cam for like two seconds, but he was

1321
01:18:53,480 --> 01:18:54,600
not having it.

1322
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:57,960
He came in here and was like, meow, meow, meow.

1323
01:18:57,960 --> 01:19:00,040
I have plenty of pictures of Cheddar, let me tell you.

1324
01:19:00,040 --> 01:19:03,960
But oh, are you going to redo the movie at the start of the thing?

1325
01:19:04,600 --> 01:19:09,480
Yeah, I need to because I had that one where I had to fix a gap in it.

1326
01:19:10,680 --> 01:19:16,120
But I would like to expand and add in some of the community cats.

1327
01:19:16,920 --> 01:19:18,600
Make them pay points to put their cat in.

1328
01:19:18,680 --> 01:19:19,240
No, just kidding.

1329
01:19:20,040 --> 01:19:21,400
We could put a redeem like that.

1330
01:19:22,600 --> 01:19:24,360
I don't want you to have to update it all the time, though.

1331
01:19:24,360 --> 01:19:25,240
So, but yes.

1332
01:19:27,080 --> 01:19:27,880
That would be fine.

1333
01:19:27,880 --> 01:19:30,760
What I would do is I would take them for a month and implement them at the end of the

1334
01:19:30,760 --> 01:19:31,260
month.

1335
01:19:32,040 --> 01:19:32,540
Okay.

1336
01:19:33,800 --> 01:19:34,680
We could look into do it.

1337
01:19:34,680 --> 01:19:37,800
I was just going to say, just open it up and let the listeners submit their cats.

1338
01:19:37,800 --> 01:19:42,200
But if we want to make them pay points to do it, I'm sure people are sitting on thousands

1339
01:19:42,200 --> 01:19:43,640
upon thousands of points.

1340
01:19:44,760 --> 01:19:46,760
And I'm sure are happy to burn them.

1341
01:19:46,840 --> 01:19:49,800
So we'll see, because we don't have a lot of redeems on this channel.

1342
01:19:49,800 --> 01:19:51,240
It's just the way it's set up.

1343
01:19:51,240 --> 01:19:52,840
So, all right.

1344
01:19:52,840 --> 01:19:56,440
Now, we also need like our alert commands and stuff like that.

1345
01:19:56,440 --> 01:19:58,840
We definitely need to update some things.

1346
01:19:58,840 --> 01:19:59,640
A first?

1347
01:19:59,640 --> 01:20:00,280
First command?

1348
01:20:04,680 --> 01:20:06,200
All right, moving on.

1349
01:20:06,200 --> 01:20:13,320
Let's talk about a rumor, rumor, rumor of a Soul Calibur remaster potentially incoming.

1350
01:20:13,320 --> 01:20:17,400
You know, we haven't seen much with the Soul Calibur series since the sixth game, which

1351
01:20:17,400 --> 01:20:19,320
I feel like was a couple of years ago at this point.

1352
01:20:19,320 --> 01:20:26,440
But if rumors are to be believed, including Xbox game journalist Shifal Nick, I hope I

1353
01:20:26,440 --> 01:20:31,880
said that right, sorry, from exputer.com, I believe is the website, reporting that Bandai

1354
01:20:31,880 --> 01:20:35,640
Namco is preparing a remaster of the original Soul Calibur.

1355
01:20:35,640 --> 01:20:41,560
This was on the Xbox era podcast, but he's unsure if it's the original Soul Calibur or

1356
01:20:41,560 --> 01:20:43,960
is it a collection with one and two.

1357
01:20:44,520 --> 01:20:50,920
After all, Soul Calibur 2 was probably the most epic edition of the game, probably because

1358
01:20:50,920 --> 01:20:52,920
the GameCube version had Link.

1359
01:20:52,920 --> 01:20:55,240
So, I don't know if they would be able to keep any of that.

1360
01:20:55,240 --> 01:20:59,000
You might remember, you got to go way back, but the GameCube version had Link.

1361
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:05,160
The Xbox version had a Tekken character, right?

1362
01:21:05,160 --> 01:21:06,040
Wasn't it?

1363
01:21:06,040 --> 01:21:07,640
I don't remember who the PlayStation.

1364
01:21:07,640 --> 01:21:10,600
I remember, oh, we lost Dark Sakura.

1365
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:15,160
I remember the Xbox version had Spawn.

1366
01:21:15,160 --> 01:21:16,040
I remember that.

1367
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:19,880
I don't remember who the PlayStation had.

1368
01:21:19,880 --> 01:21:20,600
Heihachi.

1369
01:21:20,600 --> 01:21:21,480
Was it Heihachi?

1370
01:21:21,480 --> 01:21:21,720
Okay.

1371
01:21:21,720 --> 01:21:23,160
I thought it was somebody from Tekken.

1372
01:21:23,160 --> 01:21:23,660
Yeah.

1373
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:25,240
So, all right.

1374
01:21:26,440 --> 01:21:27,960
I thought we had Yoshimitsu in one.

1375
01:21:29,240 --> 01:21:31,560
He came later, not in Soul Calibur 2.

1376
01:21:31,560 --> 01:21:35,880
He was a character in, no, he's like in the original.

1377
01:21:35,880 --> 01:21:37,960
He was just always a playable character in the series.

1378
01:21:37,960 --> 01:21:39,640
I mean, I don't know why I was thinking that.

1379
01:21:39,640 --> 01:21:44,040
I meant the Star Wars characters.

1380
01:21:44,040 --> 01:21:44,680
They were four.

1381
01:21:44,680 --> 01:21:45,400
That was four.

1382
01:21:45,400 --> 01:21:47,080
They were the big land in four.

1383
01:21:47,080 --> 01:21:47,320
Yeah.

1384
01:21:47,880 --> 01:21:50,280
Three had the Assassin's Creed crossover.

1385
01:21:51,080 --> 01:21:52,840
Four was Star Wars.

1386
01:21:52,840 --> 01:21:55,880
Five, I don't remember.

1387
01:21:55,880 --> 01:21:59,000
Battle of War, or it was Kratos, I think, was in one of them.

1388
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:00,440
Oh, you're right.

1389
01:22:02,440 --> 01:22:05,560
Was there even anyone on Xbox or was it just PlayStation that got

1390
01:22:05,560 --> 01:22:06,120
Kratos?

1391
01:22:07,240 --> 01:22:09,160
That might have been the PlayStation only one.

1392
01:22:09,160 --> 01:22:11,160
I think they only released five on PlayStation.

1393
01:22:13,160 --> 01:22:14,440
I could be wrong.

1394
01:22:14,440 --> 01:22:15,320
And then six.

1395
01:22:15,320 --> 01:22:16,040
I don't remember who...

1396
01:22:16,040 --> 01:22:17,320
Oh, six had the Witcher guy.

1397
01:22:17,320 --> 01:22:19,080
Geralt was in six.

1398
01:22:19,960 --> 01:22:22,120
So, interesting.

1399
01:22:22,120 --> 01:22:22,620
All right.

1400
01:22:23,560 --> 01:22:27,080
Let's move on and get to our next story.

1401
01:22:27,080 --> 01:22:27,960
So, Dark Sakura.

1402
01:22:27,960 --> 01:22:36,600
So, and this information is coming directly from the Federal Trade Commission.

1403
01:22:36,600 --> 01:22:44,600
So, nothing through any sort of lens other than what the FTC has said posted as of the

1404
01:22:44,600 --> 01:22:45,720
14th of this month.

1405
01:22:46,840 --> 01:22:53,880
So, they have finalized an order requiring Epic Games, as in, you know, our Fortnite

1406
01:22:53,880 --> 01:23:02,520
friends, to pay $245 million to consumers to settle charges that the company made using

1407
01:23:03,080 --> 01:23:08,680
dark patterns to trick players into making unwanted purchases and also letting underage

1408
01:23:09,560 --> 01:23:15,000
players also rack up purchases without parental involvement.

1409
01:23:15,880 --> 01:23:22,440
Basically, in the settlement, the FTC said that...

1410
01:23:23,240 --> 01:23:25,000
I'll just go ahead and read this.

1411
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:29,080
Epic deployed a variety of design tricks known as dark patterns aimed at getting consumers

1412
01:23:29,080 --> 01:23:32,200
of all ages to make unintended in-game purchases.

1413
01:23:33,720 --> 01:23:39,400
Fortnite's counterintuitive, inconsistent, and confusing button configuration led players

1414
01:23:39,400 --> 01:23:43,480
to incur unwanted charges based on the press of a single button.

1415
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:48,360
The company also made it easy for children to make purchases while playing Fortnite without

1416
01:23:48,360 --> 01:23:50,920
requiring any parental consent.

1417
01:23:50,920 --> 01:23:56,200
According to the FTC's complaint, Epic also locked the accounts of customers who disputed

1418
01:23:56,200 --> 01:23:58,520
unauthorized charges with their credit card companies.

1419
01:23:59,640 --> 01:24:05,400
They must pay $245 million, which will be used to provide refunds to consumers.

1420
01:24:06,040 --> 01:24:12,040
They also prohibit Epic from charging through dark patterns and otherwise

1421
01:24:14,040 --> 01:24:15,720
charging without affirmative consent.

1422
01:24:16,760 --> 01:24:18,760
So no more one button purchase.

1423
01:24:18,760 --> 01:24:21,320
It's like purchase, do you agree?

1424
01:24:21,320 --> 01:24:22,120
That kind of thing.

1425
01:24:23,800 --> 01:24:29,400
And it also bars Epic from blocking customers from accessing their accounts for disputing

1426
01:24:29,400 --> 01:24:30,440
unauthorized charges.

1427
01:24:33,160 --> 01:24:36,680
The commission voted four to zero to approve the complaint and order.

1428
01:24:37,880 --> 01:24:39,160
There's a separate settlement.

1429
01:24:39,160 --> 01:24:41,080
Also, this was announced in December.

1430
01:24:41,880 --> 01:24:48,120
Epic agreed to pay $275 million penalty to settle FTC allegations that the company violated

1431
01:24:48,120 --> 01:24:50,200
the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act.

1432
01:24:56,280 --> 01:25:01,480
Apparently, some data had been leaked involving underage players.

1433
01:25:02,200 --> 01:25:09,160
And also lists this for those who want, who may be involved or entitled to compensation.

1434
01:25:10,040 --> 01:25:17,560
If you believe you have been injured by Epic's practices, you can visit ftc.gov slash Fortnite.

1435
01:25:18,520 --> 01:25:27,560
So Federal Trade Commission site ftc.gov gov slash Fortnite and see if you're eligible

1436
01:25:27,560 --> 01:25:33,640
and see if you're eligible for any portion of this dispensation.

1437
01:25:34,200 --> 01:25:39,960
And this will probably be mostly, not exclusively, but mostly families with kids who racked up

1438
01:25:39,960 --> 01:25:47,960
purchases because, you know, the one touch purchasing and the tricks they do moving the

1439
01:25:47,960 --> 01:25:51,480
buttons around and things like that, you know, just all that.

1440
01:25:51,480 --> 01:25:56,840
So I'm kind of glad that we're creating some sort of standards for these games because

1441
01:25:56,840 --> 01:26:02,280
there's a lot of especially there's a lot of stuff out there with like an ad will come

1442
01:26:02,280 --> 01:26:05,640
up on the screen and you can't even like X out of the ad.

1443
01:26:05,640 --> 01:26:07,080
And it's very annoying.

1444
01:26:07,080 --> 01:26:08,760
And those aren't the Fortnite.

1445
01:26:08,760 --> 01:26:11,400
Those are the more like up and coming type of games and stuff.

1446
01:26:11,400 --> 01:26:16,920
So I'm kind of glad that this is going to set kind of a standard that at least these

1447
01:26:16,920 --> 01:26:20,840
larger studios have to go by that some of these nasty tricks are going to get in trouble

1448
01:26:20,840 --> 01:26:21,400
for.

1449
01:26:21,400 --> 01:26:26,200
So I think it was kind of needed for the industry, not just for Epic.

1450
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:34,360
Well, and this really is going to set a precedence, too, and send a very clear message that no.

1451
01:26:34,360 --> 01:26:36,200
Yeah, we're not down with that.

1452
01:26:36,200 --> 01:26:36,700
Yeah.

1453
01:26:37,160 --> 01:26:40,680
So all right, let's move on.

1454
01:26:40,680 --> 01:26:42,200
And we're over to Loki.

1455
01:26:43,320 --> 01:26:45,640
So excited for this game to be coming out.

1456
01:26:45,640 --> 01:26:48,040
It's one of those games of 2023.

1457
01:26:48,040 --> 01:26:49,960
It's Square Enix's NFT game.

1458
01:26:49,960 --> 01:26:50,600
Oh, yeah.

1459
01:26:51,240 --> 01:26:52,440
Features here already.

1460
01:26:53,400 --> 01:26:58,920
It's Symbiogenesis, and they have the first official trailer come out for the game.

1461
01:27:00,680 --> 01:27:02,040
I don't know what it is.

1462
01:27:02,040 --> 01:27:05,560
I don't know what the game is because the trailer doesn't show anything.

1463
01:27:05,560 --> 01:27:11,080
It just has annoying music and it shows like some landscape thing.

1464
01:27:11,080 --> 01:27:14,680
To be fair, that's very typical for Square Enix trailers.

1465
01:27:14,680 --> 01:27:19,480
So like, I'm not going to razz Symbiogenesis for that when there's so much more we could

1466
01:27:19,480 --> 01:27:20,440
be critical of, right?

1467
01:27:21,240 --> 01:27:28,760
Yeah, so basically it says Square Enix has all the story chapters can be completed and

1468
01:27:28,760 --> 01:27:31,640
played to the end even without having character NFTs.

1469
01:27:32,440 --> 01:27:37,240
But those in-game purchases will arrive with a specific utility for those who hold the

1470
01:27:37,240 --> 01:27:38,600
NFT collectible art.

1471
01:27:38,600 --> 01:27:43,880
Players with character NFTs will be able to read unique stories, gain rank experience

1472
01:27:43,880 --> 01:27:50,120
points easily, create a replica of their character and gain additional NFT art when the missions

1473
01:27:50,120 --> 01:27:51,160
are cleared.

1474
01:27:51,160 --> 01:27:55,560
So some story elements will be withheld from players who do not purchase NFTs impacting

1475
01:27:55,560 --> 01:27:57,160
the overall gameplay experience.

1476
01:27:58,680 --> 01:28:01,560
And you know how we can make sure that we avoid all that?

1477
01:28:02,360 --> 01:28:03,160
Don't buy it.

1478
01:28:03,160 --> 01:28:03,880
Don't support it.

1479
01:28:03,880 --> 01:28:04,760
I mean, that's easy.

1480
01:28:04,760 --> 01:28:07,400
I have no interest in this game whatsoever.

1481
01:28:07,400 --> 01:28:11,800
So this is the wrong year to release this.

1482
01:28:11,800 --> 01:28:16,360
Actually, no, this is the right year to release this game so that it completely falls off

1483
01:28:16,360 --> 01:28:18,680
the radar and Babylon flops.

1484
01:28:18,680 --> 01:28:20,840
Like that's what's going to happen to this game.

1485
01:28:24,760 --> 01:28:25,240
That's it.

1486
01:28:25,240 --> 01:28:26,200
That's all I have to say.

1487
01:28:26,200 --> 01:28:28,200
I don't think this game deserves anything more than that.

1488
01:28:28,200 --> 01:28:28,700
So.

1489
01:28:29,880 --> 01:28:30,840
Exactly.

1490
01:28:30,840 --> 01:28:31,340
So.

1491
01:28:31,720 --> 01:28:32,440
All right.

1492
01:28:32,440 --> 01:28:38,680
If you want to see how a Square Enix president got fired, you can check this game out.

1493
01:28:38,680 --> 01:28:40,600
All right, moving on.

1494
01:28:41,560 --> 01:28:47,160
This is interesting to me, a new studio that is being set up and it's from former Blizzard

1495
01:28:47,160 --> 01:28:49,880
staff, and here's the thing.

1496
01:28:50,440 --> 01:28:52,600
Jay Allen Brock is one of the three.

1497
01:28:52,600 --> 01:28:55,480
And when I heard that he was involved with this, I was kind of like, Oh, I see.

1498
01:28:55,480 --> 01:28:58,760
He's trying to come back from a lot of it because you might remember Jay Allen Brock.

1499
01:28:58,760 --> 01:29:01,320
He was the guy that was kind of shamed out of Blizzard.

1500
01:29:01,320 --> 01:29:02,520
Like that's what it was really.

1501
01:29:02,520 --> 01:29:07,800
When all the discourse came up at Blizzard and how employees are being treated and all

1502
01:29:07,800 --> 01:29:10,440
that stuff, he really took the fall for a lot of that.

1503
01:29:11,080 --> 01:29:13,480
And you know, he needed to.

1504
01:29:13,480 --> 01:29:16,360
He was the face of the company for a lot of that.

1505
01:29:16,520 --> 01:29:20,360
Mike Morhaime had been gone for a little bit, and this guy wasn't exactly good with his

1506
01:29:20,360 --> 01:29:23,960
PR and the way that he gave speeches and stuff.

1507
01:29:23,960 --> 01:29:25,320
So he left.

1508
01:29:25,320 --> 01:29:32,120
And now he's teaming up with some other former Blizzard leads to make magic soup games.

1509
01:29:32,120 --> 01:29:33,880
But here's where it gets interesting.

1510
01:29:33,880 --> 01:29:35,640
Who are those other Blizzard leads?

1511
01:29:36,360 --> 01:29:38,520
One of them is Jen O'Neill.

1512
01:29:38,520 --> 01:29:47,480
Jen O'Neill was one of the two CEOs that came in to replace Jay Allen Brock.

1513
01:29:48,920 --> 01:29:50,200
That's interesting.

1514
01:29:50,200 --> 01:29:53,320
And that's so at first I kind of just was like, Oh, whatever.

1515
01:29:53,320 --> 01:29:55,320
He's making a new studio, you know, whatever.

1516
01:29:55,320 --> 01:30:00,200
And then when I saw that she's involved too, I was like, Whoa, that is a very interesting

1517
01:30:00,200 --> 01:30:03,160
pairing because she came in to replace him.

1518
01:30:03,160 --> 01:30:10,200
And you may recall she only stayed a year and a half, if that, and she left because

1519
01:30:10,200 --> 01:30:16,440
she found out her and Mikey Barra, who is now the sole Blizzard CEO, were not making

1520
01:30:16,440 --> 01:30:17,400
the same amount of money.

1521
01:30:18,040 --> 01:30:20,280
And she put her foot down and said, I'm being underpaid.

1522
01:30:20,280 --> 01:30:21,480
This is unfair.

1523
01:30:21,480 --> 01:30:22,200
And she left.

1524
01:30:22,200 --> 01:30:26,280
And it wasn't until she left that Blizzard offered to pay her the same thing.

1525
01:30:26,280 --> 01:30:29,240
And at that point she was basically like, kiss my ass.

1526
01:30:29,240 --> 01:30:32,520
And I don't blame her whatsoever for that.

1527
01:30:32,600 --> 01:30:39,000
But isn't it interesting that she is teaming up with Jay Allen Brock?

1528
01:30:40,280 --> 01:30:42,120
I just, I just find that fascinating.

1529
01:30:42,120 --> 01:30:47,960
I mean, it's not his decision to pay, you know, like, cause if they were getting paid

1530
01:30:47,960 --> 01:30:50,280
differently, like, is it his decision that he paid?

1531
01:30:50,280 --> 01:30:51,480
Well, he had nothing to do with it.

1532
01:30:51,480 --> 01:30:54,440
He, he, she came in after he was gone.

1533
01:30:54,440 --> 01:30:54,840
Right.

1534
01:30:54,840 --> 01:30:55,080
Yeah.

1535
01:30:55,080 --> 01:30:56,600
So I don't know.

1536
01:30:56,600 --> 01:30:56,920
Yeah.

1537
01:30:56,920 --> 01:30:58,040
It's, it's interesting.

1538
01:30:58,040 --> 01:31:03,000
And then the other person involved with this, John Donham, who did have a senior role at

1539
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:06,280
Blizzard, I believe he's worked with like Amazon and some other companies as well.

1540
01:31:06,920 --> 01:31:09,240
O'Neill is going to be the studio CEO.

1541
01:31:10,360 --> 01:31:14,760
So, and she said in a statement, Jay, John, and I have similar ideas about the types of

1542
01:31:14,760 --> 01:31:19,000
games we want to make, and we're tightly aligned on company goals and principles.

1543
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,160
So this was a natural fit for us.

1544
01:31:21,160 --> 01:31:24,760
We know the quality of our games will be a reflection of our team culture.

1545
01:31:24,760 --> 01:31:28,680
We're doing the work upfront to make sure we're fostering creativity, fully remote

1546
01:31:28,680 --> 01:31:31,240
collaboration, and a diversity of backgrounds.

1547
01:31:33,160 --> 01:31:34,920
It's interesting to me.

1548
01:31:34,920 --> 01:31:40,200
I mean, when she quit Blizzard, she made it sound like she wasn't coming back to the games

1549
01:31:40,200 --> 01:31:43,640
industry or that she was going to be advocating for women in the industry.

1550
01:31:43,640 --> 01:31:47,800
And it's not to say she hasn't done that in the last, you know, 18 months or whatever

1551
01:31:47,800 --> 01:31:48,600
since she's left.

1552
01:31:48,600 --> 01:31:50,120
It's just interesting.

1553
01:31:50,440 --> 01:31:57,640
I have no other word that she's coming back and it's with him to make this company, but

1554
01:31:57,640 --> 01:31:59,720
she's going to be the CEO this time.

1555
01:31:59,720 --> 01:32:04,200
So it's just, I'm curious to see what they make and what their game is that they're coming

1556
01:32:04,200 --> 01:32:05,000
up with.

1557
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:09,560
If you, you know, to be fair, Jen O'Neill, when she was over, what was it?

1558
01:32:09,560 --> 01:32:13,480
Vicarious Visions was where she came from and they did that Diablo 2 remaster, which

1559
01:32:13,480 --> 01:32:14,280
was great.

1560
01:32:14,280 --> 01:32:17,480
And a lot of the remasters that company worked on were really good.

1561
01:32:18,200 --> 01:32:21,640
So, you know, she certainly has the resume.

1562
01:32:23,400 --> 01:32:25,160
It's going to be interesting.

1563
01:32:26,040 --> 01:32:27,720
I'm very interested to see what game they're making.

1564
01:32:27,720 --> 01:32:31,240
If they're going to try to make an RPG or something that's along the lines of what Blizzard

1565
01:32:31,240 --> 01:32:33,720
does or something completely different.

1566
01:32:35,320 --> 01:32:36,760
Questbuster says, this is what?

1567
01:32:36,760 --> 01:32:39,960
The second studio formed by former Blizzard devs.

1568
01:32:39,960 --> 01:32:44,120
There was one a few months ago working on a new RPG that was put together by former

1569
01:32:44,120 --> 01:32:45,000
WoW devs.

1570
01:32:45,800 --> 01:32:48,680
Yeah, wasn't Chris Metzen one of them?

1571
01:32:48,680 --> 01:32:50,280
And now isn't he back at Blizzard?

1572
01:32:51,480 --> 01:32:53,320
I thought I heard that was a thing recently.

1573
01:32:55,400 --> 01:32:56,440
That he had come back.

1574
01:32:59,800 --> 01:33:02,040
Let's see, I'm trying to find like the whole.

1575
01:33:03,880 --> 01:33:08,680
Oh, he returned to the company as a creative advisor in December 2022.

1576
01:33:09,480 --> 01:33:11,240
So he's only an advisor there.

1577
01:33:11,800 --> 01:33:12,300
Hmm.

1578
01:33:13,720 --> 01:33:16,760
Warchief Games was the studio that they added.

1579
01:33:16,760 --> 01:33:18,680
Oh, this is a whole other studio.

1580
01:33:18,680 --> 01:33:19,000
That's right.

1581
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:20,120
There was Frost Giant Games.

1582
01:33:20,120 --> 01:33:24,840
I was thinking of the one of Warchief Games that did the tabletop or is going to be working

1583
01:33:24,840 --> 01:33:25,400
on that.

1584
01:33:25,400 --> 01:33:26,040
Very interesting.

1585
01:33:26,040 --> 01:33:29,320
A lot of these other studios coming out of the Blizzard stuff.

1586
01:33:29,320 --> 01:33:30,600
So we'll see.

1587
01:33:31,320 --> 01:33:35,480
Hard to hard to say much more until we see a single frame of footage of whatever it is

1588
01:33:35,480 --> 01:33:37,240
they're working on, and it'll be years.

1589
01:33:37,240 --> 01:33:37,880
So we'll see.

1590
01:33:38,600 --> 01:33:39,100
All right.

1591
01:33:39,900 --> 01:33:44,860
Well, even though that will take years, we can reflect on years past and some of the

1592
01:33:44,860 --> 01:33:48,860
great games that have come in years past with our next segment.

1593
01:33:59,420 --> 01:34:04,940
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull

1594
01:34:04,940 --> 01:34:07,180
out a classic and tell you about it.

1595
01:34:07,260 --> 01:34:09,900
It's time for the classic game of the week.

1596
01:34:11,340 --> 01:34:18,860
But in a twist, once a month, Dark Sakura picks a non-video game to spotlight this year

1597
01:34:18,860 --> 01:34:19,900
in 2023.

1598
01:34:19,900 --> 01:34:20,540
And what did you pick?

1599
01:34:21,260 --> 01:34:22,140
I picked Simon.

1600
01:34:23,340 --> 01:34:33,180
Um, Simon is a game that uses your short-term memory to earn points and win the game.

1601
01:34:33,180 --> 01:34:35,260
And it makes a fart noise at you when you do badly.

1602
01:34:35,900 --> 01:34:41,820
Um, it is, uh, it was released by Milton Bradley, now Hasbro.

1603
01:34:42,700 --> 01:34:46,300
And, uh, contrary to popular belief, it is not called Simon Says.

1604
01:34:46,300 --> 01:34:49,500
Simon Says is a game that you play on the playground.

1605
01:34:50,220 --> 01:34:58,780
Um, Simon is, it's got, um, four buttons and it plays things in a sequence and anyone who

1606
01:34:58,780 --> 01:35:03,180
has played Among Us knows that there is a version of Simon in Among Us as well.

1607
01:35:03,180 --> 01:35:08,620
Um, but, uh, you know, it'll like start with red, you hit red and then red, green, red,

1608
01:35:08,620 --> 01:35:10,220
green, and then red, green, green, red, green, green.

1609
01:35:10,220 --> 01:35:14,060
You know, you have to repeat it and you have to remember the sequence.

1610
01:35:14,060 --> 01:35:19,980
Um, but for, uh, a little bit more of, of the history behind this, basically you have

1611
01:35:19,980 --> 01:35:24,540
to play the sequence within the time limit that it gives you or else the game is over.

1612
01:35:25,580 --> 01:35:30,860
Um, but it was manufactured and published by Milton Bradley and then Hasbro.

1613
01:35:30,860 --> 01:35:39,100
Um, it was, uh, the coding is in Assembly, written by, uh, Charles Capps, who also taught

1614
01:35:39,100 --> 01:35:42,860
computer science at Temple University and wrote one of the first books on the theories

1615
01:35:42,860 --> 01:35:44,380
of computer programming.

1616
01:35:44,380 --> 01:35:48,300
It was launched in 1978 at Studio 54.

1617
01:35:49,900 --> 01:35:50,620
Yep.

1618
01:35:50,620 --> 01:35:55,500
In New York City, it was an immediate success and then it boomed all over pop culture.

1619
01:35:56,140 --> 01:36:02,540
Um, but yeah, it, uh, uh, to have a little bit of history about it, um, there was an

1620
01:36:02,540 --> 01:36:09,020
Atari game called Touch Me, and this was at the, uh, uh, uh, Music Operators of America

1621
01:36:09,020 --> 01:36:11,180
trade show in 1976.

1622
01:36:11,180 --> 01:36:15,820
And, uh, Ralph Baer and Howard Morrison were there.

1623
01:36:15,820 --> 01:36:20,460
They said, nice gameplay, terrible execution, visually boring, miserable rasping sounds.

1624
01:36:21,180 --> 01:36:23,100
So they bought the prototype.

1625
01:36:24,060 --> 01:36:32,140
Um, and, uh, sorry, the, the prototype, uh, I'm sorry for this was actually built on a

1626
01:36:32,140 --> 01:36:37,340
Texas Instruments TMS 1000 microcomputer chip, like many of the games, 1970s.

1627
01:36:37,900 --> 01:36:42,460
And then, um, Lenny Cope, who was also one of the partners there programmed the core

1628
01:36:42,460 --> 01:36:44,140
of the game that was called Follow Me.

1629
01:36:44,860 --> 01:36:51,020
Um, they developed the tones, they were inspired by the sounds of a bugle.

1630
01:36:51,020 --> 01:36:56,860
And then when they pitched the demo, um, uh, they had an eight by eight inch console and

1631
01:36:56,860 --> 01:36:59,900
they showed Milton Bradley and they changed the name to Simon.

1632
01:37:00,620 --> 01:37:10,540
Uh, Simon did debut 1978 at the retail price of $24 and 95 cents, which today, as I show

1633
01:37:10,540 --> 01:37:11,980
100 Matt, that's funny.

1634
01:37:11,980 --> 01:37:14,940
Studio 54, I'm sure people played it with their nose, if you know what I mean.

1635
01:37:15,580 --> 01:37:18,380
Um, no, Cher played it on the back of a white horse.

1636
01:37:18,940 --> 01:37:26,540
Um, anyway, uh, that would be the equivalent of $104 as of 2021.

1637
01:37:26,540 --> 01:37:32,300
So it was, it was expensive, but it became one of the top selling story, uh, stories,

1638
01:37:32,300 --> 01:37:34,060
toys for that holiday season.

1639
01:37:34,860 --> 01:37:41,580
And its patent is, uh, 4002, uh, sorry, 4 million, 2007 and 87.

1640
01:37:42,220 --> 01:37:48,460
Um, micro computer controlled game was, uh, it was granted its patent in 1980.

1641
01:37:49,100 --> 01:37:54,940
And then they did, uh, others that came out, you know, after that, um, I mean, I didn't

1642
01:37:54,940 --> 01:37:58,380
know anyone who didn't have a Simon at some point.

1643
01:37:58,380 --> 01:37:59,420
I had a Simon.

1644
01:38:00,140 --> 01:38:06,860
Um, I had several Simons, but we had, uh, they released like a pocket Simon and then

1645
01:38:06,860 --> 01:38:07,900
a super Simon.

1646
01:38:08,460 --> 01:38:13,580
I have only ever seen a super Simon once in the wild.

1647
01:38:15,820 --> 01:38:21,100
Um, super Simon, we'll get into that in a little bit, but at any rate, there have been

1648
01:38:21,100 --> 01:38:25,740
so many different variants since Hasbro acquired Milton Bradley in the 1980s.

1649
01:38:26,540 --> 01:38:32,780
Um, there was again, the super Simon was a hexagonal unit with six buttons, um, only

1650
01:38:32,780 --> 01:38:34,060
released in Europe.

1651
01:38:34,060 --> 01:38:37,260
Like I said, I've only seen one super Simon in person.

1652
01:38:37,980 --> 01:38:43,900
Uh, in 2000, there was Simon squared, which was a unit with the four buttons on one side

1653
01:38:43,900 --> 01:38:45,900
and a set of eight smaller buttons on the other.

1654
01:38:46,460 --> 01:38:52,620
2004, we had Simon sticks, which had two electronic sticks, like drumsticks and an emphasis on

1655
01:38:52,620 --> 01:38:57,580
the musical part of the game that, uh, different, like four levels of, uh, of game play.

1656
01:38:58,220 --> 01:38:58,860
I agree.

1657
01:38:58,860 --> 01:39:01,260
If there was no Simon, there would be no bop it.

1658
01:39:01,260 --> 01:39:09,100
Um, anyway, in 2005, we got Simon trickster also known as Simon tricks in, uh, Europe,

1659
01:39:09,100 --> 01:39:11,260
UK and Simon genius in Brazil.

1660
01:39:12,060 --> 01:39:18,060
It had four game modes that were similar to bop it and colored lenses instead of buttons.

1661
01:39:18,620 --> 01:39:23,660
Um, there's also of course, Simon classic mode, which plays up to 35 tones.

1662
01:39:23,660 --> 01:39:27,580
Simon bounces like Simon classic, but the colors of the lenses change.

1663
01:39:28,300 --> 01:39:33,420
Simon surprise is probably one of the most difficult ones.

1664
01:39:33,420 --> 01:39:36,460
Every lens is the same color and you have to memorize the location.

1665
01:39:37,180 --> 01:39:42,700
Uh, Simon rewind, uh, requires you to memorize the sequence backwards.

1666
01:39:43,500 --> 01:39:49,980
Um, and then you are paid a compliment after you, you finish on reaching five and 11 tones,

1667
01:39:49,980 --> 01:39:52,860
the game will say, awesome, nice, sweet respect.

1668
01:39:53,500 --> 01:39:57,740
Um, on 18, you get a victory melody that plays three times.

1669
01:39:58,620 --> 01:40:06,220
Um, and then in 2011, there was Simon flash, which in this one, you have a cube, uh, the

1670
01:40:06,220 --> 01:40:10,860
game has a four cube shaped electronic modules that the player must move around depending

1671
01:40:10,860 --> 01:40:11,660
on the game mode.

1672
01:40:12,460 --> 01:40:17,980
Um, 2013, they reinvented Simon one more time with Simon swipe.

1673
01:40:18,700 --> 01:40:25,100
Um, it has a circular unit that looks like a steering wheel and the four, it extended

1674
01:40:25,100 --> 01:40:30,380
from four buttons to eight touchscreen buttons, which are all flattened out on the unit and

1675
01:40:30,380 --> 01:40:32,620
you play by, you know, swiping.

1676
01:40:33,420 --> 01:40:41,900
And then there was Simon air in 2016, um, that used motion sensors, kind of like the,

1677
01:40:41,900 --> 01:40:43,660
the loops games.

1678
01:40:43,740 --> 01:40:46,780
And it had a solo classic multiplayer mode.

1679
01:40:46,780 --> 01:40:54,860
Um, and it tried to retain, um, it's, uh, aesthetic when they did a button version,

1680
01:40:54,860 --> 01:40:56,940
um, you know, kind of like the old school one.

1681
01:40:56,940 --> 01:41:02,860
And then there was Simon optics, which is a headset motion sensor game, but you know

1682
01:41:02,860 --> 01:41:05,260
what, let's go back to the old school.

1683
01:41:05,980 --> 01:41:11,820
Um, so the original Simon, like I said, four colored buttons, each with a different tone

1684
01:41:11,820 --> 01:41:16,620
when pressed or activated by the device and around in the game consists of the game lighting

1685
01:41:16,620 --> 01:41:19,420
up in the random order, and you have to mimic that order.

1686
01:41:20,220 --> 01:41:26,860
Um, and the name did come from the children's games, Simon says, but also based on Atari's

1687
01:41:26,860 --> 01:41:29,180
touch me arcade game from 1974.

1688
01:41:29,980 --> 01:41:33,660
Um, but this is just Simon.

1689
01:41:33,660 --> 01:41:38,700
So the tones were designed to always be harmonic, no matter the sequence.

1690
01:41:38,700 --> 01:41:43,980
And they consisted of an, a major triad and second inversion, like a trumpet fanfare.

1691
01:41:44,940 --> 01:41:55,660
So the blue, the blue was E the yellow was C sharp at red was a and green was E, but

1692
01:41:55,660 --> 01:41:58,620
it was an octave lower than what, uh, than the blue E.

1693
01:41:59,420 --> 01:42:04,940
Um, and some of them though, in 1978, they did use some alternative tones and they used

1694
01:42:04,940 --> 01:42:06,460
a B flat minor triad.

1695
01:42:07,020 --> 01:42:08,220
So blue was B flat.

1696
01:42:09,260 --> 01:42:10,380
Yellow was C sharp.

1697
01:42:10,380 --> 01:42:15,740
Red was F and green was, uh, uh, the lower octave B flat.

1698
01:42:16,380 --> 01:42:21,260
Um, and it had been re-released and redesigned and there's actually like a clear one.

1699
01:42:21,980 --> 01:42:26,140
Um, I know for me, it's always the original Simon.

1700
01:42:26,780 --> 01:42:33,260
Um, and then Nelsonic, which I have brought up last year as doing the, the, the watch

1701
01:42:33,260 --> 01:42:33,660
games.

1702
01:42:33,660 --> 01:42:34,300
Remember them?

1703
01:42:35,260 --> 01:42:37,740
Uh, they did a Simon wristwatch version.

1704
01:42:39,900 --> 01:42:46,780
So, um, the, you know, like I said, there were different shapes and different sizes

1705
01:42:46,780 --> 01:42:49,340
and different ways it came out.

1706
01:42:50,140 --> 01:42:53,100
The Simon swipe actually had a different note progression.

1707
01:42:53,100 --> 01:43:01,980
Um, it had blue was G yellow was C red was E and green was a high octave, uh, G.

1708
01:43:02,940 --> 01:43:06,140
Um, and there have been so many clones, so many clones.

1709
01:43:07,020 --> 01:43:13,580
Um, Atari re-released, uh, their handheld Touch Me in 1978 with multicolored buttons

1710
01:43:13,580 --> 01:43:14,460
and better sounds.

1711
01:43:15,420 --> 01:43:24,540
And, um, they, uh, there was Monkey C, Monkey Do that had oval shaped buttons.

1712
01:43:24,540 --> 01:43:29,420
Tiger electronics did copycats in 1979 with a transparent case and used buzzards.

1713
01:43:29,420 --> 01:43:33,180
It was also re-released by Sears as Follow Me, which was the original name.

1714
01:43:33,820 --> 01:43:40,780
Um, and then there was Copycat Jr. and Pocket Repeat by Tandy Computers as in Tandy from

1715
01:43:40,780 --> 01:43:41,500
Radio Shack.

1716
01:43:42,460 --> 01:43:44,700
Um, Castle Toys had Einstein.

1717
01:43:44,700 --> 01:43:47,020
Genius came out in Brazil in the eighties.

1718
01:43:47,020 --> 01:43:49,420
Space Echo was by some company.

1719
01:43:50,220 --> 01:43:54,620
Um, there was a DIY version out there that you could solder together.

1720
01:43:55,420 --> 01:44:01,500
Um, another DIY called Electronic Memory Game that was based on the Arm Cortex, uh, microcontrollers.

1721
01:44:02,460 --> 01:44:07,740
Uh, Game A mode on the second game in the Game & Watch handheld was Flagman.

1722
01:44:07,740 --> 01:44:10,860
Game B, uh, is the same, but it doesn't play in sequence.

1723
01:44:10,860 --> 01:44:13,820
You have a limited time to respond to where it lifts up.

1724
01:44:13,820 --> 01:44:17,740
It was R2D2 Ditto Droid, which is a Star Wars version.

1725
01:44:17,740 --> 01:44:21,020
And this was released by Tiger Electronics in 1987.

1726
01:44:21,740 --> 01:44:27,420
Uh, there's a side quest in the SNES and Game Boy Advance versions of Donkey Kong Country 3,

1727
01:44:27,420 --> 01:44:32,700
Dixie Kong's Double Trouble that had, that was called like Banana Birds and you had to

1728
01:44:32,700 --> 01:44:34,380
use the different buttons on your controller.

1729
01:44:35,100 --> 01:44:43,740
Uh, Soviet company Electronica, um, IE01 Evolga, which was almost an exact replica of Simon.

1730
01:44:43,740 --> 01:44:46,700
Oddworld Games had very similar puzzles.

1731
01:44:47,500 --> 01:44:50,460
Um, sequences also were on several other handhelds.

1732
01:44:50,460 --> 01:44:52,860
Just all kinds of Parker Brothers games, Atari.

1733
01:44:53,420 --> 01:44:58,300
There was a, there was a Toytronics Gotcha, which was very similar.

1734
01:44:59,020 --> 01:45:07,420
Um, and then, uh, the audio will, will play consistently and then some will actually kind

1735
01:45:07,420 --> 01:45:07,900
of cut down.

1736
01:45:07,900 --> 01:45:14,140
There's some that use dog sounds, cats, pigs, cows, xylophones, different kinds of space

1737
01:45:14,140 --> 01:45:14,540
sounds.

1738
01:45:15,180 --> 01:45:19,500
Um, but also it had a very big involvement in, uh, pop culture.

1739
01:45:20,460 --> 01:45:27,740
Um, in the book, the Tommyknockers that came out in 1987 by Stephen King, uh, someone had

1740
01:45:27,740 --> 01:45:34,940
left a Simon in the back seat of a reporter's car that activated itself and went into a

1741
01:45:34,940 --> 01:45:38,140
frenzy overheating and melting and scorched the seat.

1742
01:45:38,780 --> 01:45:42,220
The driver then knocks it to the floor before it goes up in flames.

1743
01:45:42,940 --> 01:45:45,900
Uh, and it's always sunny in Philadelphia.

1744
01:45:45,900 --> 01:45:49,740
Um, someone finds a Simon in the closet, uh, Little Miss Gamer.

1745
01:45:50,460 --> 01:45:55,980
Uh, Simon, uh, uh, actually had characters meeting up.

1746
01:45:56,700 --> 01:46:02,620
A family guy was in, American Dad, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, Cougar Town, Paranormal

1747
01:46:02,620 --> 01:46:03,020
Activity.

1748
01:46:03,020 --> 01:46:05,660
There was a possessed Simon that worked as a Ouija board.

1749
01:46:06,220 --> 01:46:10,860
A robot chicken, Dick Cheney's heart was replaced with a Simon, like as in Iron Man.

1750
01:46:12,380 --> 01:46:13,180
You remember, right?

1751
01:46:13,900 --> 01:46:16,460
No, I just, robot chicken players.

1752
01:46:16,460 --> 01:46:20,860
I mean, there was some in British T-shows, there's a mini game in Sabrina the Teenage

1753
01:46:20,860 --> 01:46:22,220
Witch for Game Boy Advance.

1754
01:46:22,780 --> 01:46:27,900
Uh, even in, uh, South Park, The Stick of Truth, you had to play Simon to rescue Randy

1755
01:46:27,900 --> 01:46:29,100
Marsh from an alien probe.

1756
01:46:29,900 --> 01:46:35,180
Uh, Quicktime Events, uh, The Island, Despicable Me, Veronica, which is a Spanish movie.

1757
01:46:35,740 --> 01:46:37,660
Uh, I'll just, all kinds of stuff.

1758
01:46:37,660 --> 01:46:40,460
And then of course, like I said, there was the sequence in Among Us.

1759
01:46:41,340 --> 01:46:47,100
Um, I like how it says it, in late 2020, the popular game Among Us featured a mini game

1760
01:46:47,100 --> 01:46:49,100
loosely based on the design of Simon.

1761
01:46:49,100 --> 01:46:52,780
However, most players mistakenly referred to it as Simon Says.

1762
01:46:54,140 --> 01:46:56,860
It's kind of a pet peeve, but I don't say too much about it.

1763
01:46:57,420 --> 01:47:00,940
Um, but yeah, it's, there you go.

1764
01:47:01,820 --> 01:47:04,700
Oh gosh, it was even in Heart to Heart, and I kind of remember this.

1765
01:47:05,660 --> 01:47:10,060
Um, it was in the season to be murdered, the Hearts play, uh, a fake Simon.

1766
01:47:11,420 --> 01:47:17,740
And then games magazine, uh, included Simon in their top 100 games of 1980 and called

1767
01:47:17,740 --> 01:47:20,300
it the original electronic follow the leader game.

1768
01:47:21,260 --> 01:47:23,740
Um, I have a question.

1769
01:47:23,740 --> 01:47:26,700
I know you've talked a lot about this and we want to get back into the news, but I'm

1770
01:47:26,700 --> 01:47:30,620
genuinely curious after looking at this video where some person in the camera is extremely

1771
01:47:30,620 --> 01:47:33,260
shaky and, uh, they're showing all their things.

1772
01:47:34,300 --> 01:47:34,860
Yeah, no, no, no.

1773
01:47:34,860 --> 01:47:39,660
I'm not even, I found a different one because they show the super Simon and I'm super curious

1774
01:47:39,660 --> 01:47:42,060
because I never played one of these, but you referenced it.

1775
01:47:42,060 --> 01:47:42,780
Like what?

1776
01:47:42,780 --> 01:47:46,620
I mean, this thing looks weird because there's like up and down colors.

1777
01:47:46,620 --> 01:47:48,540
What, what was super about super Simon?

1778
01:47:49,580 --> 01:47:50,700
Barely remember.

1779
01:47:50,700 --> 01:47:55,580
I was a kid and one of my friends who grew up in, in England had one.

1780
01:47:56,620 --> 01:47:58,940
Um, God, how old was I?

1781
01:47:58,940 --> 01:48:00,060
I have to think about it now.

1782
01:48:00,700 --> 01:48:01,980
Super Simon.

1783
01:48:01,980 --> 01:48:04,700
Um, yeah, I'm just trying to figure out.

1784
01:48:04,700 --> 01:48:08,540
It's all right if you don't remember, but this looks so different than the others.

1785
01:48:08,540 --> 01:48:16,620
It was, yeah, it was like this big long strip and yeah, I barely remember anything about

1786
01:48:16,620 --> 01:48:17,180
it.

1787
01:48:17,180 --> 01:48:19,420
I just remembered that one of my friends had it.

1788
01:48:20,220 --> 01:48:21,420
How old was I?

1789
01:48:21,420 --> 01:48:23,420
I had to have been like six.

1790
01:48:23,420 --> 01:48:25,580
I know they came out in the late seventies.

1791
01:48:25,580 --> 01:48:27,100
Super Simon came out in 79.

1792
01:48:28,300 --> 01:48:34,380
Um, and yeah, I just remembered not being very good at it, but we would play it together.

1793
01:48:34,380 --> 01:48:35,180
We would take turns.

1794
01:48:35,740 --> 01:48:36,620
Interesting.

1795
01:48:36,620 --> 01:48:40,700
Uh, I thought I liked this perspective too from bonds, double six and chat, and I don't

1796
01:48:40,700 --> 01:48:45,100
know if this is Simon influence or just the colors, but I thought this was interesting.

1797
01:48:45,100 --> 01:48:50,940
Bon's double six says those colors are imprinted into so many of the everyday visuals we deal

1798
01:48:50,940 --> 01:48:54,060
with controller button colors for video games.

1799
01:48:54,060 --> 01:48:56,940
And that is, that is a very good point.

1800
01:48:56,940 --> 01:49:00,300
I just so happen to have an Xbox series X controller right here.

1801
01:49:00,300 --> 01:49:05,900
And if you look at the buttons for X, Y, B, and A red, yellow, green, blue, just like

1802
01:49:05,900 --> 01:49:06,380
a Simon.

1803
01:49:06,380 --> 01:49:10,700
Now, granted, you could say that, well, it's the primary, it's the RGB and the primary

1804
01:49:10,700 --> 01:49:13,340
goes, but I mean, there's no purple, there's no orange.

1805
01:49:13,900 --> 01:49:14,700
I know, I know.

1806
01:49:14,700 --> 01:49:15,580
But you know what I mean?

1807
01:49:15,580 --> 01:49:18,220
Either it's primary light or primary, you know, um,

1808
01:49:18,220 --> 01:49:22,220
But look at the Japanese, um, SNES color scheme.

1809
01:49:22,860 --> 01:49:26,060
It had the colored buttons on it and the little logo on the side.

1810
01:49:26,060 --> 01:49:26,460
Yeah.

1811
01:49:26,460 --> 01:49:28,780
It was, it's, it was those colors.

1812
01:49:28,780 --> 01:49:31,340
I mean, I've sampled those colors directly for my channel.

1813
01:49:31,340 --> 01:49:35,260
You know, they are a red, yellow, blue, and green.

1814
01:49:36,540 --> 01:49:42,860
And so it's just, I don't know if it's an influence from Simon as much as it is an influence

1815
01:49:42,860 --> 01:49:44,460
of general aesthetics.

1816
01:49:45,260 --> 01:49:50,220
They're just colors that, well, I mean, red and green are actually opposites on the color

1817
01:49:50,220 --> 01:49:55,740
wheel, um, which means that side by side, they actually would cause a little bit of

1818
01:49:55,740 --> 01:49:59,100
mental discomfort, which true story.

1819
01:49:59,100 --> 01:50:01,580
That's why Freddy Krueger's sweater is red and green.

1820
01:50:02,220 --> 01:50:03,100
Oh, I didn't know that.

1821
01:50:03,820 --> 01:50:04,140
Yeah.

1822
01:50:04,140 --> 01:50:05,340
Gotta love Christmas.

1823
01:50:05,340 --> 01:50:05,820
All right.

1824
01:50:05,820 --> 01:50:08,860
Uh, those are the colors you see everywhere Christmas.

1825
01:50:08,860 --> 01:50:09,580
All right.

1826
01:50:09,580 --> 01:50:13,900
Anyway, um, Simon, long history for that game.

1827
01:50:14,620 --> 01:50:18,940
See it referenced not just in pop culture, but in other video games, including very recent

1828
01:50:18,940 --> 01:50:19,980
things like among us.

1829
01:50:19,980 --> 01:50:20,380
Yeah.

1830
01:50:20,380 --> 01:50:21,740
Huge influence to that game.

1831
01:50:21,740 --> 01:50:23,100
So, all right.

1832
01:50:23,100 --> 01:50:26,700
A great segment for the classic not video game game.

1833
01:50:27,340 --> 01:50:27,740
All right.

1834
01:50:27,740 --> 01:50:31,420
Let's travel around back to video games and talk about some other news going on in the

1835
01:50:31,420 --> 01:50:33,980
industry in a segment we call rapid fire news.

1836
01:50:33,980 --> 01:50:34,780
We'll go to Loki.

1837
01:50:35,580 --> 01:50:35,820
Yeah.

1838
01:50:35,820 --> 01:50:39,580
So start with March's PlayStation plus update.

1839
01:50:39,580 --> 01:50:44,700
It's going to be adding lots of big games, including, uh, ghost wire Tokyo, which we

1840
01:50:44,700 --> 01:50:52,060
just talked about was coming to Xbox, uh, rage to immortals, Phoenix rising and, uh, some

1841
01:50:52,060 --> 01:50:53,660
other stuff on there as well.

1842
01:50:53,660 --> 01:50:54,140
Let's see.

1843
01:50:55,500 --> 01:50:58,460
Um, uncharted legacy of thieves collection.

1844
01:50:58,460 --> 01:50:59,020
Pretty cool.

1845
01:50:59,020 --> 01:51:02,060
Rainbow six extraction, uh, life is strange.

1846
01:51:02,060 --> 01:51:02,860
True colors.

1847
01:51:02,860 --> 01:51:05,020
Life is strange to Dragon ball.

1848
01:51:05,020 --> 01:51:09,180
Z cock rot street fighter five championship edition.

1849
01:51:09,180 --> 01:51:11,660
Untitled goose game, uh, final fantasy type.

1850
01:51:11,660 --> 01:51:12,380
Oh, HD.

1851
01:51:12,380 --> 01:51:13,020
That's a game.

1852
01:51:13,020 --> 01:51:13,500
I forgot.

1853
01:51:13,500 --> 01:51:18,060
I bought, um, Neo the world ends with you and Haven.

1854
01:51:18,700 --> 01:51:22,620
And then of course three new classic PlayStation games coming as well.

1855
01:51:23,500 --> 01:51:30,140
I mean, only the best Ridge racer game ever Ridge racer type four, uh, April Academy two

1856
01:51:30,140 --> 01:51:33,580
for PSP and safe and filter dark mirror for PSP.

1857
01:51:34,860 --> 01:51:36,460
Seriously, Namco Bandai.

1858
01:51:37,820 --> 01:51:40,700
Why no, why no new Ridge racer game?

1859
01:51:40,700 --> 01:51:41,900
This makes me very sad.

1860
01:51:42,460 --> 01:51:44,140
Why, why do I have to wait so long?

1861
01:51:44,700 --> 01:51:50,460
Give us a full remaster of our four and, and find some way to bring in the jog con

1862
01:51:50,460 --> 01:51:51,260
compatibility.

1863
01:51:52,060 --> 01:51:57,500
Can we just have them sell the Ridge racer franchise to the team that makes Forza horizons,

1864
01:51:57,500 --> 01:52:00,460
please just do that.

1865
01:52:00,460 --> 01:52:02,300
Like that would be, make everybody happy.

1866
01:52:02,940 --> 01:52:05,260
Force has kind of made a name for itself at this point though.

1867
01:52:05,260 --> 01:52:05,980
So I don't know.

1868
01:52:05,980 --> 01:52:07,020
I don't know if you're interested.

1869
01:52:08,140 --> 01:52:10,620
I need to just re-listen to the R4 soundtrack.

1870
01:52:10,620 --> 01:52:11,900
It is so good.

1871
01:52:11,900 --> 01:52:12,400
Yeah.

1872
01:52:13,420 --> 01:52:13,920
All right.

1873
01:52:14,540 --> 01:52:18,860
And then, um, we've got some more news regarding the next silent Hill movie.

1874
01:52:18,860 --> 01:52:21,260
They have some of the cast, uh, picked out.

1875
01:52:21,260 --> 01:52:22,380
That's correct.

1876
01:52:22,380 --> 01:52:29,820
So now we're going to have Jeremy, um, Irvine as, I guess, James and, uh, Hannah, Emily

1877
01:52:29,820 --> 01:52:35,020
Anderson, who was in jigsaw, uh, who was going to be the co-star.

1878
01:52:35,020 --> 01:52:37,900
I'm not sure, uh, who she is playing though.

1879
01:52:41,660 --> 01:52:44,540
Or maybe they're leaving it open for her to play multiple roles.

1880
01:52:45,180 --> 01:52:45,900
Maybe, maybe.

1881
01:52:45,900 --> 01:52:46,380
Who knows?

1882
01:52:47,260 --> 01:52:51,020
Um, but that, that's interesting that they are, uh, yeah.

1883
01:52:51,020 --> 01:52:55,100
Taking this movie further and actually going to do it.

1884
01:52:55,100 --> 01:52:56,060
It sounds like so.

1885
01:52:56,780 --> 01:52:57,280
Yeah.

1886
01:52:57,500 --> 01:53:00,620
This was supposed to be pretty true to silent Hill two where it's the original movie.

1887
01:53:00,620 --> 01:53:02,540
And again, I liked the original movie.

1888
01:53:02,540 --> 01:53:06,540
Um, but it wasn't like it was kind of the plot of the first game.

1889
01:53:06,540 --> 01:53:06,780
Right.

1890
01:53:06,780 --> 01:53:09,340
But like, didn't they, they make some pretty big changes to it.

1891
01:53:09,340 --> 01:53:09,820
So I don't know.

1892
01:53:09,820 --> 01:53:11,900
It seems like they want to pyramid head in there.

1893
01:53:11,900 --> 01:53:12,300
Yeah.

1894
01:53:12,300 --> 01:53:12,780
Yeah.

1895
01:53:12,780 --> 01:53:13,500
There were a number.

1896
01:53:13,500 --> 01:53:17,900
I think, I think the, the, you know, pyramid, I'm actually going to quote

1897
01:53:17,900 --> 01:53:19,580
Shayla and start calling him pyramid guy.

1898
01:53:20,300 --> 01:53:25,340
Um, pyramid guy was, was in there, I think more for the sake of fan service.

1899
01:53:25,900 --> 01:53:26,860
Which is fine.

1900
01:53:26,860 --> 01:53:32,140
You have them there in the trailer that, and honestly, the, the purpose of the character

1901
01:53:32,140 --> 01:53:37,180
in silent Hill two was there as a punisher and executioner.

1902
01:53:37,900 --> 01:53:42,460
So it fits in and it was actually part of the town's mythos.

1903
01:53:42,460 --> 01:53:47,420
So I don't see any reason for it to not be in a non silent Hill related, you know, silent

1904
01:53:47,420 --> 01:53:49,020
Hill two related story.

1905
01:53:49,020 --> 01:53:51,660
So were they going to still make the second movie as canon?

1906
01:53:51,660 --> 01:53:52,780
Cause I don't even remember.

1907
01:53:52,780 --> 01:53:54,620
I never watched the second movie.

1908
01:53:54,620 --> 01:53:55,740
I watched the first one.

1909
01:53:55,740 --> 01:53:56,460
I love the first one.

1910
01:53:56,460 --> 01:54:00,300
You mean the one that was based off three, the 3d revelation or whatever it's called.

1911
01:54:00,860 --> 01:54:05,820
I liked that one because I liked Heather, Cheryl, Heather, Mason.

1912
01:54:05,820 --> 01:54:07,580
I thought there was a second silent Hill movie.

1913
01:54:07,580 --> 01:54:10,060
It was, it was that it was based off three.

1914
01:54:10,060 --> 01:54:10,380
Yeah.

1915
01:54:10,380 --> 01:54:11,260
Oh, okay.

1916
01:54:12,220 --> 01:54:15,420
And I really, I mean, it's not a great movie.

1917
01:54:15,420 --> 01:54:21,020
I'll admit that, but I like it because I silent Hill three is my favorite of the series.

1918
01:54:21,020 --> 01:54:29,500
I love seeing things from a, a rebellious, strong, young teenager, you know, who's going

1919
01:54:29,500 --> 01:54:33,020
out and thrown into this world and dealing with all of this shit.

1920
01:54:33,020 --> 01:54:33,520
Yeah.

1921
01:54:34,060 --> 01:54:39,980
I'm, I'm very curious to see what they do with the, this, you know, supposedly loyal

1922
01:54:39,980 --> 01:54:41,500
adaptation of silent Hill two.

1923
01:54:41,500 --> 01:54:42,060
We'll see.

1924
01:54:42,060 --> 01:54:46,300
We'll see, especially in a year where we know we're getting, you know, as Jason kind of

1925
01:54:46,300 --> 01:54:48,460
referenced in the intro, it's the year of silent Hill.

1926
01:54:48,460 --> 01:54:52,220
We already know, like they're working on all of these other projects, including a silent

1927
01:54:52,220 --> 01:54:53,180
Hill two remaster.

1928
01:54:53,740 --> 01:54:59,100
Oh, just add that to the fucking list from earlier in the show for this year.

1929
01:54:59,100 --> 01:54:59,600
Jesus.

1930
01:55:00,220 --> 01:55:04,300
What a year, like going from like, oh gosh, like years where it's like, can we please

1931
01:55:04,300 --> 01:55:05,420
get a new silent Hill game?

1932
01:55:05,420 --> 01:55:08,140
They're like, we're going to give you so many silent Hill games.

1933
01:55:08,140 --> 01:55:08,940
It's like, okay.

1934
01:55:08,940 --> 01:55:13,820
I can't believe when I was going over all those 20, 23 games earlier, I didn't name

1935
01:55:13,820 --> 01:55:15,020
a single silent Hill game.

1936
01:55:15,660 --> 01:55:17,100
Just add that to the list.

1937
01:55:17,100 --> 01:55:21,340
There's so much that we're going to forget about that's coming out like, oh yeah, that's

1938
01:55:21,340 --> 01:55:21,740
right.

1939
01:55:21,740 --> 01:55:22,540
That's a thing.

1940
01:55:22,540 --> 01:55:26,620
And some games are going to suffer because this year is too stacked.

1941
01:55:27,900 --> 01:55:28,940
That's the weird thing.

1942
01:55:28,940 --> 01:55:29,440
Fine.

1943
01:55:30,780 --> 01:55:34,220
I hope you all saved your PTO from during the pandemic because you're going to be burning

1944
01:55:34,220 --> 01:55:35,820
it on video games this year.

1945
01:55:35,820 --> 01:55:39,020
All right.

1946
01:55:40,620 --> 01:55:40,940
Let's see.

1947
01:55:40,940 --> 01:55:43,180
We have other rapid fire news, I think for Dark Sakura.

1948
01:55:44,140 --> 01:55:44,640
Yeah.

1949
01:55:45,420 --> 01:55:49,340
There is a new Tekken 8 trailer that has martial law coming back.

1950
01:55:50,460 --> 01:55:52,140
I love the character of martial law.

1951
01:55:52,140 --> 01:55:54,300
I think he looks way too yoked out in this though.

1952
01:55:56,060 --> 01:56:00,140
Like I, the thing I always liked about martial law and forest law is that they were the,

1953
01:56:00,140 --> 01:56:03,020
you know, the sleek Bruce Lee type, like almost completely.

1954
01:56:03,980 --> 01:56:10,780
And he's, he looks like someone took anabolic steroids and gave him a freaking, uh, IV full

1955
01:56:10,780 --> 01:56:11,280
of them.

1956
01:56:12,780 --> 01:56:14,220
He took whatever Bane's taking.

1957
01:56:15,100 --> 01:56:20,700
But I had to see this for myself on, uh, the YouTube that they released here, just to see

1958
01:56:20,700 --> 01:56:21,740
what you're talking about here.

1959
01:56:22,460 --> 01:56:24,220
Does he not look like super yoked?

1960
01:56:24,220 --> 01:56:25,340
Yeah, a little bit, a little bit.

1961
01:56:26,140 --> 01:56:31,980
But, but I always liked the character and, you know, I got out of Tekken right around,

1962
01:56:31,980 --> 01:56:33,340
I'd say Tekken 5.

1963
01:56:33,340 --> 01:56:37,260
Oh no, I hate that poppy, veiny look.

1964
01:56:39,260 --> 01:56:41,020
Not a fan, not a fan of that look.

1965
01:56:41,020 --> 01:56:41,740
I'm with you.

1966
01:56:41,740 --> 01:56:42,300
Love the character.

1967
01:56:42,300 --> 01:56:42,860
Don't love this.

1968
01:56:43,500 --> 01:56:49,420
But I've seen some really neat stuff in this and especially, you know, my man Jean looks

1969
01:56:49,420 --> 01:56:50,380
uh, pretty hot.

1970
01:56:51,260 --> 01:56:56,540
So I think that I would, this might be the one that gets me back into Tekken.

1971
01:56:56,540 --> 01:56:57,040
Yeah.

1972
01:56:58,380 --> 01:57:00,620
Ooh, Darts of Steel with an interesting point here.

1973
01:57:01,180 --> 01:57:05,980
I'm reminded of that BS story about Fei Long not being in Street Fighter 6.

1974
01:57:05,980 --> 01:57:08,060
I want to, I remember that whole drama.

1975
01:57:08,620 --> 01:57:11,580
I want to say martial law was the same kind of character.

1976
01:57:11,580 --> 01:57:12,080
Yeah.

1977
01:57:12,700 --> 01:57:16,300
So it's interesting that that BS story didn't follow over here, but anyway.

1978
01:57:17,260 --> 01:57:17,760
Yeah.

1979
01:57:18,220 --> 01:57:24,140
Well, I mean, I, I see, I don't really know what the difference would be.

1980
01:57:24,140 --> 01:57:27,580
I think there's got to be some other reason, but I don't think it has to do with like,

1981
01:57:28,060 --> 01:57:33,980
I mean, martial law and forest law started off kind of similar, but they also had like

1982
01:57:33,980 --> 01:57:37,340
the backstory of cooking and all this other stuff going on.

1983
01:57:37,340 --> 01:57:38,940
So maybe they were different enough.

1984
01:57:38,940 --> 01:57:39,440
Yeah.

1985
01:57:40,140 --> 01:57:43,980
Um, moving on to something very different than what we're used to, at least with the

1986
01:57:43,980 --> 01:57:45,500
pre-orders in the United States.

1987
01:57:45,500 --> 01:57:49,900
And that is a pre-order that Amazon Japan, a pre-order bonus that Amazon Japan is offering

1988
01:57:49,900 --> 01:57:53,020
for, excuse me, Zelda Tears of the Kingdom.

1989
01:57:53,020 --> 01:57:55,420
And that is a spoon and a fork.

1990
01:57:55,420 --> 01:58:00,700
Now, before you giggle at the concept of a spoon and fork being a pre-order item, there's

1991
01:58:00,700 --> 01:58:04,220
silverware seems to be a common theme with some Japanese pre-orders.

1992
01:58:04,220 --> 01:58:08,860
I remember when Dark Sakura had that game for the Dreamcast, the Saturn.

1993
01:58:09,900 --> 01:58:10,700
It was Counter Sakura.

1994
01:58:10,700 --> 01:58:10,940
That's right.

1995
01:58:10,940 --> 01:58:13,820
Came with like a whole fricking dish and everything else.

1996
01:58:13,820 --> 01:58:17,340
Um, and then I think I saw on Twitter, I think I just saw him in chat, uh, Shane.

1997
01:58:17,340 --> 01:58:17,660
Yeah.

1998
01:58:17,660 --> 01:58:20,860
Who said, uh, who's also waiting for the short message message game.

1999
01:58:20,860 --> 01:58:27,900
I want to say Shane had posted that a Pokemon out in Japan had a fork and a spoon too, scarlet

2000
01:58:27,900 --> 01:58:28,540
and violet.

2001
01:58:28,540 --> 01:58:30,460
So this isn't exactly unheard of.

2002
01:58:30,460 --> 01:58:34,940
It's just not something you often see in the U S as a pre-order bonus.

2003
01:58:34,940 --> 01:58:40,060
Sakura Taisen that came out, um, at the same time that that Cardcaptor Sakura game came

2004
01:58:40,060 --> 01:58:42,300
out also had a big bonus set like that.

2005
01:58:42,300 --> 01:58:42,620
Yeah.

2006
01:58:42,620 --> 01:58:42,860
Yeah.

2007
01:58:42,860 --> 01:58:49,420
My, my Cardcaptor Sakura came with, um, a pillowcase, a fork and a knife, a bowl and

2008
01:58:49,420 --> 01:58:50,460
a pillowcase cover.

2009
01:58:50,940 --> 01:58:51,420
A pillowcase.

2010
01:58:52,380 --> 01:58:52,860
Why not?

2011
01:58:53,820 --> 01:58:54,620
So why not?

2012
01:58:54,620 --> 01:58:55,100
Why not?

2013
01:58:55,100 --> 01:58:56,060
There you go.

2014
01:58:56,060 --> 01:58:56,300
All right.

2015
01:58:56,300 --> 01:59:00,540
Well, we'll check out some other, uh, limited edition releases because they love limited

2016
01:59:00,540 --> 01:59:01,980
edition releases in Japan.

2017
01:59:01,980 --> 01:59:05,900
There's always like every game you, you hear me read those release dates every week.

2018
01:59:05,900 --> 01:59:07,740
Like every other game has a limited edition.

2019
01:59:07,740 --> 01:59:11,660
We'll get into some of those, but first let's go to the U S and check out some, uh, releases

2020
01:59:11,660 --> 01:59:12,620
for the U S this week.

2021
01:59:13,420 --> 01:59:17,580
This week we have mighty doom coming out on iOS and Android.

2022
01:59:17,580 --> 01:59:19,660
That's the cute little doom game that they're putting out.

2023
01:59:20,140 --> 01:59:23,900
Uh, remnant from the ashes for Nintendo switch.

And it looks like a leader of the week.

2031
02:00:03,740 --> 02:00:09,660
We also have the outlier Risa three, uh, coming out on, uh, looks like PC, Nintendo switch

2032
02:00:09,660 --> 02:00:11,260

2033
02:00:11,260 --> 02:00:13,900
Maybe one physical one digital or something like that.

2034
02:00:14,460 --> 02:00:17,820
Uh, which, uh, Oh, the first one is for Japan.

2035
02:00:17,820 --> 02:00:18,320
There we go.

2036
02:00:18,860 --> 02:00:24,380
So you asking it slightly a little bit later resident evil for the remake finally coming

out on PC, PlayStation four, PlayStation five and Xbox series.

2038
02:00:29,420 --> 02:00:30,940
And I believe that's it for the week.

2039
02:00:31,980 --> 02:00:32,300
All right.

2040
02:00:32,300 --> 02:00:35,820
Heading to Japan and checking out some of the releases on the Nintendo switch at layer

2041
02:00:35,820 --> 02:00:41,580

Uh, SD Shin common writer rumble is also out this week from bandai Namco, uh, in Japan

02:01:00,060 --> 02:01:04,860
And if you're a fan of NBA two K 23, well, it gets a price reduction, uh, it goes into

2048
02:01:04,860 --> 02:01:07,100
the two K collection in Japan this week.

Uh, so you can check that out if you haven't already over on the PlayStation five in Japan,

02:01:22,380 --> 02:01:25,580
also getting a multilingual edition out in Japan this week.

2053
02:01:25,580 --> 02:01:30,540
And then that biohazard re four, cause remember they call the series biohazard over there.

2054
02:01:30,540 --> 02:01:36,620
What we call resident evil that is also coming out in Japan this week, uh, for the PlayStation

2055
02:01:36,620 --> 02:01:36,940
five.

2056
02:01:36,940 --> 02:01:42,780
And yes, there is a deluxe edition and a collector's edition also available in Japan.

2057
02:01:42,780 --> 02:01:46,300
I was just looking to see if that collector's edition includes a knife and a fork.

2058
02:01:46,300 --> 02:01:49,900
I'm sorry to say it does not, but it does look like it has a little crate.

2059
02:01:49,900 --> 02:01:51,980
This looks like one of those crates that sits on the map.

2060
02:01:51,980 --> 02:01:58,220
When you play against Wesker in a deadline that you get with this collector's edition

2061
02:01:58,220 --> 02:01:59,820
here for a resident evil.

2062
02:01:59,820 --> 02:02:03,740
So, but that's what can sit on the shelf.

2063
02:02:03,740 --> 02:02:05,820
Uh, there's also that whole Leon statue.

2064
02:02:05,820 --> 02:02:06,700
That's pretty cool.

2065
02:02:06,700 --> 02:02:11,020
I got to say, I mean, I have to have less physical stuff in my house, but that Leon

2066
02:02:11,020 --> 02:02:12,620
statue does look pretty cool.

2067
02:02:12,620 --> 02:02:17,500
So I have to say that going back to, um, the, uh, our type final three.

2068
02:02:17,500 --> 02:02:18,000
Yeah.

2069
02:02:18,540 --> 02:02:25,500
Um, apparently people name video games the way I named my art files final.

2070
02:02:25,500 --> 02:02:29,660
No, really the final, uh, the extra final, final part two, final part three.

2071
02:02:30,620 --> 02:02:32,700
They should just give up no more finals.

2072
02:02:33,740 --> 02:02:38,300
Um, interesting comment from, uh, DJ Roma S before we get to the UK dates, uh, asking

2073
02:02:38,300 --> 02:02:44,780
about the grim guardian games to didn't, they change the name to, uh, gal guardians.

2074
02:02:44,780 --> 02:02:48,940
Uh, they actually changed the name, you know, when I'm looking at this list of releases,

2075
02:02:48,940 --> 02:02:51,740
they are still, and this could be a Japan versus us thing.

2076
02:02:51,740 --> 02:02:55,260
Cause remember I am reading Japanese releases, but they actually show the

2077
02:02:55,740 --> 02:02:58,460
box art here still stating that it's grim guardians.

2078
02:02:58,460 --> 02:03:03,740
So I don't know if maybe, I don't know, but yeah, that's what it's showing the box art

2079
02:03:03,740 --> 02:03:04,060
there.

2080
02:03:04,060 --> 02:03:07,020
So it could be, it could be something that they just changed here.

2081
02:03:07,020 --> 02:03:08,140
Uh, I don't know.

2082
02:03:08,140 --> 02:03:08,640
Interesting.

2083
02:03:09,980 --> 02:03:10,460
Uh, moving on.

2084
02:03:10,460 --> 02:03:11,740
How about the UK Darzaka?

2085
02:03:13,420 --> 02:03:18,700
Um, let's see in the UK, I really a handful of things on the 21st for switch.

2086
02:03:18,700 --> 02:03:20,300
We have remnant from the ashes.

2087
02:03:20,860 --> 02:03:25,500
Also, um, the 23rd for the switch Ravens burger memory.

2088
02:03:26,300 --> 02:03:29,820
Uh, on PlayStation and switch, we have crazy chicken cart too.

2089
02:03:30,460 --> 02:03:32,300
On the 24th for switch.

2090
02:03:32,300 --> 02:03:34,460
I'm sorry for PlayStation and X-Box.

2091
02:03:34,460 --> 02:03:36,860
We have resident evil for remake steel book edition.

2092
02:03:37,500 --> 02:03:41,020
Um, for PlayStation, we have tournament boy commits tax evasion.

2093
02:03:41,020 --> 02:03:42,140
I just think that's the best name.

2094
02:03:42,860 --> 02:03:47,660
Um, and again, on the 24th, uh, for PlayStation and switch.

2095
02:03:47,740 --> 02:03:53,340
I'll tell you, uh, I'll tell you Risa three alchemist of the end and secret key.

2096
02:03:56,460 --> 02:04:02,380
All right, let's move on and get a few more stories and then maybe some phone calls.

2097
02:04:02,380 --> 02:04:07,020
If you want to call in later in the show over at vog network.com slash discord, you can

2098
02:04:07,020 --> 02:04:11,340
always join the green room and, uh, join the discord conversations throughout the week.

2099
02:04:11,340 --> 02:04:14,860
Uh, some of our stories tonight coming from the orange launch radio channel on discord,

2100
02:04:14,860 --> 02:04:19,180
cause you all like the, uh, the piece on, um, magic spoon games I talked about earlier.

2101
02:04:19,180 --> 02:04:21,180
No magic soup games, not magic spoon.

2102
02:04:21,180 --> 02:04:23,020
I'm getting confused with the Zelda pre-order.

2103
02:04:23,020 --> 02:04:26,140
Uh, but the magic soup games came from the, uh, discord.

2104
02:04:26,140 --> 02:04:27,260
Somebody had posted that the other night.

2105
02:04:27,260 --> 02:04:29,180
So, and I was like, Oh, I hadn't heard about this.

2106
02:04:29,180 --> 02:04:32,620
So, uh, thank you all who participate in our discord server throughout the week.

2107
02:04:32,620 --> 02:04:34,300
Vog network.com slash discord.

2108
02:04:34,300 --> 02:04:37,340
And you can call in by joining the green room in just a moment.

2109
02:04:37,340 --> 02:04:38,860
We still have about 10 minutes before we get there.

2110
02:04:38,860 --> 02:04:40,860
Cause we still have a few more stories.

2111
02:04:40,860 --> 02:04:41,660
Let's go to Loki.

2112
02:04:42,540 --> 02:04:42,780
Yeah.

2113
02:04:42,780 --> 02:04:49,980
So Blizzard has banned about 120,000 world of Warcraft, um, bot accounts that were using

2114
02:04:49,980 --> 02:04:54,540
the definite class of farm resources from wrath of the Lich King classic.

2115
02:04:54,540 --> 02:04:59,580
Um, they said, you know, we felt it was very important for the launch of wrath of the Lich

2116
02:04:59,580 --> 02:05:04,780
King classic to give anyone who wanted to hop in this iconic expansion, the ability to do so

2117
02:05:04,780 --> 02:05:09,820
with few barriers as possible, allowing every account to access the death night,

2118
02:05:09,820 --> 02:05:13,420
even if they did not meet the historical requirements, it was important.

2119
02:05:13,420 --> 02:05:18,460
However, now that the initial launch period is passed, we no longer wish to allow unrestricted

2120
02:05:18,460 --> 02:05:24,300
creation of death nights on brand new accounts is tempting, or it was an attempting vector

2121
02:05:24,300 --> 02:05:29,660
for malicious actors to use to get into the game and start exploiting very quickly.

2122
02:05:29,660 --> 02:05:33,260
So they're no longer allowing you to create a death night.

2123
02:05:33,260 --> 02:05:36,540
Um, from the get go, you still have to go through the process to do it.

2124
02:05:37,340 --> 02:05:43,100
The normal method, I guess to, you know, stop, stop the body counts, I guess.

2125
02:05:44,140 --> 02:05:47,500
This is funny because I remember doing this in classic wow.

2126
02:05:47,500 --> 02:05:53,100
Like when this game was live, I remember rolling death nights to have alt characters that could

2127
02:05:53,100 --> 02:05:57,020
do farming, like, you know, with stuff that maybe I don't have otherwise.

2128
02:05:57,020 --> 02:06:02,060
Like if I, my main character had, uh, herbalism, alchemy, maybe I have a death night who could

2129
02:06:02,060 --> 02:06:04,460
do mining and pick that up really fast.

2130
02:06:04,540 --> 02:06:08,140
But again, you had to have a character at level 55 in the original one.

2131
02:06:08,140 --> 02:06:10,780
So you, you had to go up through the ranks originally anyway.

2132
02:06:10,780 --> 02:06:14,060
So I mean, you're just kind of reverting back to that basically.

2133
02:06:14,060 --> 02:06:14,700
So yeah.

2134
02:06:15,420 --> 02:06:16,460
All right.

2135
02:06:16,460 --> 02:06:17,420
Dark Sakura.

2136
02:06:18,780 --> 02:06:22,700
This story makes me say, oh my God, shoes.

2137
02:06:24,620 --> 02:06:27,900
Um, well, they are definitely shoes.

2138
02:06:28,780 --> 02:06:29,260
Oh my God.

2139
02:06:30,780 --> 02:06:32,700
These shoes are 300 fucking dollars.

2140
02:06:32,700 --> 02:06:33,660
They probably are.

2141
02:06:34,780 --> 02:06:39,580
Well, funny enough, I was actually, when I was, I was playing midnight suns last night

2142
02:06:39,580 --> 02:06:42,300
and I just went right into shoes and I had no idea why.

2143
02:06:44,060 --> 02:06:44,560
Anyway.

2144
02:06:45,020 --> 02:06:50,940
Um, Red Wing, the company that makes, you know, boots, work boots and other boots and

2145
02:06:50,940 --> 02:06:54,460
everything did, um, Mario's boots.

2146
02:06:55,820 --> 02:06:59,580
Um, they are not for sale for the record.

2147
02:06:59,580 --> 02:07:00,700
They are not 500.

2148
02:07:00,700 --> 02:07:02,380
They're not 300 fucking dollars.

2149
02:07:03,340 --> 02:07:12,860
Um, but at any rate, um, the, uh, the company has on their website, a video for showing

2150
02:07:12,860 --> 02:07:19,900
how they transformed Mario's, uh, footwear into real world boots.

2151
02:07:19,900 --> 02:07:22,700
It has serene music and you witness the design.

2152
02:07:22,700 --> 02:07:23,020
It does.

2153
02:07:23,020 --> 02:07:25,180
Some of it may have just slipped through on the stream a little bit.

2154
02:07:25,180 --> 02:07:26,140
Sorry about that.

2155
02:07:26,140 --> 02:07:27,260
Let's get to the good stuff.

2156
02:07:27,260 --> 02:07:28,060
Show the shoes.

2157
02:07:28,060 --> 02:07:28,620
There we go.

2158
02:07:29,580 --> 02:07:33,420
Um, but at any rate, um, it's not the first time this has been done.

2159
02:07:33,420 --> 02:07:41,980
Um, uh, uh, Brooklyn, uh, art collective, MSCHF like mischief, uh, did a pair of, uh,

2160
02:07:41,980 --> 02:07:43,500
ballooning red boots.

2161
02:07:43,500 --> 02:07:45,900
Um, like were shown on Astro Boy.

2162
02:07:46,780 --> 02:07:52,460
And, uh, they were, they were purchased actually for $350.

2163
02:07:52,700 --> 02:07:53,580
Not bad.

2164
02:07:53,580 --> 02:07:58,460
And were worn by Lil Wayne, Lil Nas X, Coily Ray and Rich the Kid.

2165
02:07:59,180 --> 02:08:05,420
But I think that these Mario ones are not going to see the light of day as far as anything

2166
02:08:05,420 --> 02:08:06,380
the public can acquire.

2167
02:08:07,340 --> 02:08:10,140
But they kind of look comfortable.

2168
02:08:10,780 --> 02:08:15,180
Um, apparently, uh, DGRMS, I thought I saw this on Twitter and I'm loving the caption

2169
02:08:15,180 --> 02:08:18,300
on this, by the way, it says dramatic music and workshop sounds, uh, they're the whole

2170
02:08:18,300 --> 02:08:18,780
thing.

2171
02:08:18,780 --> 02:08:22,460
But DGRMS says, uh, the shoes are on display at Nintendo New York.

2172
02:08:22,460 --> 02:08:25,980
And I remember seeing some stuff on social media about they had a whole fanfare to unveil

2173
02:08:25,980 --> 02:08:30,060
some shoes that were just shoes that you can't buy.

2174
02:08:30,940 --> 02:08:31,980
Boots are not for sale.

2175
02:08:32,860 --> 02:08:33,580
Rob.

2176
02:08:33,580 --> 02:08:33,820
What?

2177
02:08:34,380 --> 02:08:35,660
Let's see some shirts.

2178
02:08:37,100 --> 02:08:37,500
Let's get them.

2179
02:08:37,500 --> 02:08:40,780
I've already been to New York and after five minutes, I was like, let's go.

2180
02:08:43,660 --> 02:08:44,140
All right.

2181
02:08:44,860 --> 02:08:49,260
Uh, moving on, uh, Loki with some, uh, not great news this week.

2182
02:08:49,260 --> 02:08:49,740
Yeah.

2183
02:08:49,740 --> 02:08:56,060
Unfortunately, um, we had the news that Lance Reddick had passed away and, you know, he

2184
02:08:56,060 --> 02:09:03,180
was 60 years old, a Hollywood actor who had played in many, um, big properties.

2185
02:09:03,180 --> 02:09:08,060
You know, The Wire, John Wick also had a significant role in Destiny 2.

2186
02:09:08,940 --> 02:09:13,740
Um, yeah, unfortunately he, he passed away this week.

2187
02:09:14,060 --> 02:09:19,580
And of course, along with that, you know, there was, um, tributes that were done by

2188
02:09:19,580 --> 02:09:25,100
Destiny players, uh, to, um, the fallen commander.

2189
02:09:25,100 --> 02:09:28,460
And I mean, it's, it's pretty cool to see.

2190
02:09:28,460 --> 02:09:35,260
And of course, you know, um, you know, lots of, uh, heartfelt responses from different

2191
02:09:35,260 --> 02:09:41,020
people and, you know, talking about him and everything far too young, I feel.

2192
02:09:41,420 --> 02:09:45,100
Yeah, um, 60, still really young, uh, all things considered.

2193
02:09:45,100 --> 02:09:49,980
And yeah, um, as I mentioned in chat there, uh, D'Artouzia says, I admit, I didn't know

2194
02:09:49,980 --> 02:09:52,540
he had a few video game roles, but still sad stuff.

2195
02:09:52,540 --> 02:09:53,020
Yeah.

2196
02:09:53,020 --> 02:09:57,500
And I think, um, as far as recent stuff goes, if I remember right, he was the, uh, guy that

2197
02:09:57,500 --> 02:10:01,340
played Wesker in the new Resident Evil series that was on Netflix.

2198
02:10:01,340 --> 02:10:06,300
Granted, wasn't, wasn't really well received and didn't get renewed because it's a Netflix

2199
02:10:06,300 --> 02:10:09,980
show, but he still, you know, definitely made an impression as, you know, a different

2200
02:10:10,940 --> 02:10:15,660
take on Wesker, uh, than maybe what people were used to, uh, from, uh, what's his names,

2201
02:10:15,660 --> 02:10:17,100
you know, vocal performances.

2202
02:10:17,100 --> 02:10:22,620
So, um, yeah, uh, SJ100Matt says he was so talented and such a good guy.

2203
02:10:22,620 --> 02:10:26,540
I followed him on Twitter and he always posted about his dogs and playing games.

2204
02:10:26,540 --> 02:10:28,940
Uh, Meech says he was in the new John Wick.

2205
02:10:28,940 --> 02:10:31,580
Sorry, if you mentioned it, I'm gaming some kind of zoning out.

2206
02:10:31,580 --> 02:10:35,340
No, I mean, definitely a lot of his media appearances he was definitely known for.

2207
02:10:35,340 --> 02:10:36,940
Um, so, um,

2208
02:10:37,020 --> 02:10:39,820
just remember him from the Eric Andre show.

2209
02:10:40,620 --> 02:10:41,120
Yeah.

2210
02:10:42,060 --> 02:10:43,580
This bit was great in that.

2211
02:10:43,580 --> 02:10:46,060
Oh, Shane pointing out another, uh, game that he was involved in.

2212
02:10:46,060 --> 02:10:47,100
I forgot about his role here.

2213
02:10:47,100 --> 02:10:49,420
He says, I'll always remember him from Fringe.

2214
02:10:49,420 --> 02:10:50,860
So there's a lot of, you know, folks.

2215
02:10:50,860 --> 02:10:52,060
Oh yes, for sure.

2216
02:10:52,060 --> 02:10:52,380
Yeah.

2217
02:10:52,380 --> 02:10:52,860
Fringe.

2218
02:10:52,860 --> 02:10:53,340
Awesome.

2219
02:10:53,340 --> 02:10:56,140
And saying, and the highly underrated Quantum Break.

2220
02:10:56,700 --> 02:11:00,460
Yeah, that game was, you know, did fall off the radar of a lot of people, but that was

2221
02:11:00,460 --> 02:11:02,540
a really impressive early Xbox One game.

2222
02:11:02,540 --> 02:11:06,540
So yeah, uh, Questbuster points out his character in Horizon Zero Dawn.

2223
02:11:07,020 --> 02:11:09,100
He's played a lot more than just the one in Destiny.

2224
02:11:09,100 --> 02:11:11,420
It's just that Destiny is the one that everybody's connected.

2225
02:11:11,420 --> 02:11:15,740
So, you know, you're able to kind of do those, uh, tributes, you know, when people pass away.

2226
02:11:15,740 --> 02:11:21,900
Hey, Bob, I knew you were talking about age and something, I actually looked this up for

2227
02:11:21,900 --> 02:11:26,060
a minute and you know that middle age is now considered 55 to 65.

2228
02:11:27,500 --> 02:11:28,060
Oh, wow.

2229
02:11:29,100 --> 02:11:29,900
That's good.

2230
02:11:29,900 --> 02:11:30,300
That's good.

2231
02:11:30,300 --> 02:11:31,340
I'm still not middle aged.

2232
02:11:31,340 --> 02:11:31,580
Good.

2233
02:11:33,020 --> 02:11:33,660
Me either.

2234
02:11:35,100 --> 02:11:35,980
All right.

2235
02:11:35,980 --> 02:11:41,500
Well, otherwise I still want to, you know, turn into, you know, Stalker Channing as the

2236
02:11:41,500 --> 02:11:46,780
ant, you know, in practical magic and just be cool and wake, wake people up for midnight

2237
02:11:46,780 --> 02:11:47,500
margaritas.

2238
02:11:48,700 --> 02:11:49,340
That would be me.

2239
02:11:49,980 --> 02:11:52,860
TigerClownChat says, I thought middle age was when you reached the 40s.

2240
02:11:52,860 --> 02:11:53,420
Not anymore.

2241
02:11:54,140 --> 02:11:57,180
Haven't you heard that old saying 40 is the new 20?

2242
02:11:57,180 --> 02:11:57,900
Wasn't what they say.

2243
02:11:57,900 --> 02:11:58,540
I don't know.

2244
02:11:58,540 --> 02:12:05,820
But anyway, they also say, like, I think that what is actually like back in, uh,

2245
02:12:06,220 --> 02:12:13,180
the 1920s old was 55 and now like new old is like 65.

2246
02:12:13,180 --> 02:12:19,180
I, yeah, I think that's absolutely what you're referring to is just because of science and

2247
02:12:19,180 --> 02:12:21,260
treatment of diseases and prevention.

2248
02:12:21,980 --> 02:12:27,180
People are able and less, you know, um, wars and so forth.

2249
02:12:27,180 --> 02:12:30,540
Not to say there isn't any, but less, uh, on a global scale.

2250
02:12:30,540 --> 02:12:33,900
Anyway, uh, the, the life expectancy is getting longer.

2251
02:12:34,300 --> 02:12:39,900
But anyway, apparently what, what defines the old age is when you hit, uh, the age that

2252
02:12:39,900 --> 02:12:42,220
is the common for, I think, 4% mortality.

2253
02:12:43,660 --> 02:12:45,580
Anyway, there's your science lesson.

2254
02:12:46,700 --> 02:12:50,940
Lance Riddick though, uh, by these standards was still middle age and far too young.

2255
02:12:50,940 --> 02:12:53,340
So, uh, a great loss for the industry.

2256
02:12:54,140 --> 02:12:54,700
All right.

2257
02:12:54,700 --> 02:12:59,420
Last story tonight, and this is usually the in, in memoriam stories would be the last

2258
02:12:59,420 --> 02:13:03,500
story, but I I'm purposely burying this one at the end of the show because I'm sick and

2259
02:13:03,500 --> 02:13:07,180
tired of talking about Call of Duty to be quite honest.

2260
02:13:07,820 --> 02:13:09,580
Call of Duty, more like it.

2261
02:13:09,580 --> 02:13:16,380
But we have, it is a big title in the industry and it has been dominating what's going on

2262
02:13:16,380 --> 02:13:20,220
with the Activision Blizzard acquisition and all that.

2263
02:13:20,220 --> 02:13:26,620
So what happened this week in the ongoing saga of Microsoft trying to get the regulators

2264
02:13:26,620 --> 02:13:28,780
to allow them to buy Activision Blizzard?

2265
02:13:28,780 --> 02:13:33,100
Microsoft signed another 10 year Call of Duty agreement.

2266
02:13:33,660 --> 02:13:35,900
Dark Soccer, this one may be interesting to you.

2267
02:13:35,900 --> 02:13:39,980
I know you're not a big Call of Duty player, but the agreement they signed was with an

2268
02:13:39,980 --> 02:13:43,500
international cloud gaming service called Boosteroid.

2269
02:13:44,620 --> 02:13:45,900
Oh, Boosteroid.

2270
02:13:45,900 --> 02:13:46,140
Yeah.

2271
02:13:46,940 --> 02:13:47,500
And the company-

2272
02:13:49,500 --> 02:13:52,460
I was, I really wanted to like Boosteroid.

2273
02:13:52,460 --> 02:13:59,820
I really, really wanted to, but the connection was so bad.

2274
02:13:59,820 --> 02:14:00,060
Yeah.

2275
02:14:00,060 --> 02:14:02,220
And it sounds like they're mainly overseas too.

2276
02:14:02,380 --> 02:14:06,060
Their development team is Ukraine based.

2277
02:14:06,060 --> 02:14:07,820
The software development team is Ukraine based.

2278
02:14:07,820 --> 02:14:11,020
So yeah, they're probably, it's probably a different experience in the UK than what

2279
02:14:11,020 --> 02:14:11,660
you had here.

2280
02:14:12,380 --> 02:14:16,700
But Boosteroid is the service that's going to be getting Call of Duty in a 10 year agreement

2281
02:14:16,700 --> 02:14:17,340
here.

2282
02:14:17,340 --> 02:14:24,140
So Microsoft is trying to sign these agreements to try to get the deal to close so that it

2283
02:14:24,140 --> 02:14:28,700
does, and also continue to make Sony look like they're getting an offer that they are

2284
02:14:28,700 --> 02:14:30,300
just refusing basically.

2285
02:14:30,300 --> 02:14:31,660
So interesting.

2286
02:14:32,460 --> 02:14:41,340
And kind of related, and this is very important, bignews.com, Disney Dreamlight Valley is finally

2287
02:14:41,340 --> 02:14:42,460
available on GeForce.

2288
02:14:43,340 --> 02:14:46,860
Oh, I didn't know it was not on there originally.

2289
02:14:46,860 --> 02:14:47,260
Interesting.

2290
02:14:47,260 --> 02:14:48,220
It wasn't for a little bit.

2291
02:14:48,220 --> 02:14:51,580
It just popped up on my available list and I already own it.

2292
02:14:52,940 --> 02:14:53,260
All right.

2293
02:14:54,220 --> 02:14:54,860
All right.

2294
02:14:54,860 --> 02:14:58,940
Well, that was all of the news we officially had slated for tonight, but I am going to

2295
02:14:58,940 --> 02:15:00,620
open things up for the listener round table.

2296
02:15:00,620 --> 02:15:04,540
If we have anyone that wants to call in, go for it over at vognetwork.com slash discord,

2297
02:15:04,540 --> 02:15:05,500
you join the green room.

2298
02:15:06,140 --> 02:15:09,420
Also, if you have any just general questions, maybe you're just feeling shy, you don't really

2299
02:15:09,420 --> 02:15:10,460
want to call, that's fine.

2300
02:15:10,460 --> 02:15:11,820
You can ask your questions in chat.

2301
02:15:12,460 --> 02:15:14,140
I always do a mailbag check.

2302
02:15:14,140 --> 02:15:16,620
I don't think I saw anything, but I will check in.

2303
02:15:16,620 --> 02:15:20,220
Participate at orangelaunchradio.com is the place to send emails.

2304
02:15:21,100 --> 02:15:25,980
I'm afraid that the dust bunnies in there have like formed entire warrens and they're

2305
02:15:25,980 --> 02:15:27,900
in competition with cobwebs.

2306
02:15:27,900 --> 02:15:28,540
And spam.

2307
02:15:31,020 --> 02:15:36,300
The, well, this, this, is that why the floor in there is all sticky and squishy?

2308
02:15:36,300 --> 02:15:40,140
There's a little bit of spam that, that lines the floor in there.

2309
02:15:40,140 --> 02:15:40,380
All right.

2310
02:15:41,180 --> 02:15:43,660
But not as bad as the old, uh, email account.

2311
02:15:43,660 --> 02:15:49,020
So, uh, Fanara in chat says, have you shared the D and D Easter egg?

2312
02:15:49,020 --> 02:15:49,980
I, what is that?

2313
02:15:49,980 --> 02:15:50,860
So cool.

2314
02:15:50,860 --> 02:15:51,420
What is this?

2315
02:15:51,420 --> 02:15:52,380
I don't, I actually don't know.

2316
02:15:53,100 --> 02:16:00,140
There is apparently a scene where the group in the movie is walking and across from them

2317
02:16:00,140 --> 02:16:03,260
is the cartoon D and D party.

2318
02:16:04,140 --> 02:16:05,020
Oh, that's funny.

2319
02:16:06,140 --> 02:16:06,540
Yeah.

2320
02:16:07,500 --> 02:16:13,500
Um, uh, Gwen sent me the picture and I will, uh, send it, send you the link.

2321
02:16:14,060 --> 02:16:16,780
Did that movie actually come out now or is that next week?

2322
02:16:16,780 --> 02:16:18,700
It's next week, I think.

2323
02:16:18,700 --> 02:16:21,260
Who wants to go see it with me at the end of the month?

2324
02:16:21,260 --> 02:16:22,380
Maybe I want to go.

2325
02:16:22,380 --> 02:16:26,300
They re-released it back into theaters, I think just this week, but everything everywhere

2326
02:16:26,300 --> 02:16:27,500
all at once is in theaters again.

2327
02:16:27,500 --> 02:16:30,380
I kind of want to see it, but, um, I didn't get to see it.

2328
02:16:30,380 --> 02:16:32,460
I didn't get to do it this weekend, so it'd have to be during the week.

2329
02:16:33,100 --> 02:16:36,380
But one of the places it's playing is the Roseville Galleria.

2330
02:16:36,380 --> 02:16:40,220
And so you can go upstairs to watch the movie and then downstairs to go to round one.

2331
02:16:40,220 --> 02:16:42,060
So just food for thought.

2332
02:16:42,060 --> 02:16:45,180
I sent you the, um, the picture, but you know what?

2333
02:16:45,180 --> 02:16:48,540
I'll go ahead and post, uh, the link in chat that Gwen gave me.

2334
02:16:49,340 --> 02:16:51,180
So there you go.

2335
02:16:51,180 --> 02:16:53,820
Now all of our friends can, can see it too.

2336
02:16:54,380 --> 02:16:59,500
Uh, Shane in chat says, I know nothing about D&D, but I want to see it for some reason.

2337
02:16:59,500 --> 02:17:02,140
Um, the previews look good.

2338
02:17:02,700 --> 02:17:05,420
Uh, and yeah, StarSakura, uh, boop the link there in chat.

2339
02:17:05,420 --> 02:17:08,620
I'm not going to show the picture on stream just because some people are very hypersensitive

2340
02:17:08,620 --> 02:17:09,420
about spoilers.

2341
02:17:09,420 --> 02:17:11,020
So I'm just gonna, you know, leave it at that.

2342
02:17:11,020 --> 02:17:13,900
You, you, you can click the link if you like, but I won't show it on stream for now.

2343
02:17:13,900 --> 02:17:15,260
We haven't already just told you.

2344
02:17:15,260 --> 02:17:16,140
Yeah, right.

2345
02:17:16,140 --> 02:17:21,180
Uh, as Joe 100 Matt says, speaking of emptying your wallet, have you seen the Tron Light

2346
02:17:21,180 --> 02:17:23,740
Cycle Run merch that they're going to have at Disney World?

2347
02:17:23,740 --> 02:17:27,020
Oh, is this the whole like custom figures?

2348
02:17:27,020 --> 02:17:28,140
Yes.

2349
02:17:28,140 --> 02:17:29,340
Give it to us.

2350
02:17:29,340 --> 02:17:30,860
We went into Disneyland.

2351
02:17:30,860 --> 02:17:33,580
It looks so, yeah, it does look so good.

2352
02:17:33,580 --> 02:17:37,580
Like you can make your own, cause of course the lightsabers work so well.

2353
02:17:37,580 --> 02:17:37,980
Yeah.

2354
02:17:37,980 --> 02:17:44,220
I, when, when am I going to be able to afford to go to Disney World?

2355
02:17:45,260 --> 02:17:48,700
We need like this whole underground complex and call it the grid.

2356
02:17:48,700 --> 02:17:51,180
Here's, here's the sad thing about this whole thing.

2357
02:17:52,460 --> 02:17:56,620
I'm gonna go on the Star Trek cruise out of Port Canaveral.

2358
02:17:57,180 --> 02:18:00,140
That's, you fly into Orlando to go to Port Canaveral.

2359
02:18:00,140 --> 02:18:03,180
Technically they have their own airport, but everybody says it's quicker if you just fly

2360
02:18:03,180 --> 02:18:04,380
into Orlando.

2361
02:18:04,380 --> 02:18:07,500
So we're gonna be in Florida in Orlando.

2362
02:18:08,380 --> 02:18:11,180
But like, and Bobby's even saying, go next February.

2363
02:18:11,180 --> 02:18:15,980
Here's the thing, but thinking it through, that means we would do, cause we wouldn't

2364
02:18:15,980 --> 02:18:17,660
just be able to do one day at Disney World.

2365
02:18:17,660 --> 02:18:19,020
We'd have to do like two or three.

2366
02:18:19,580 --> 02:18:25,580
So we do like three days at Disney World and then a seven day cruise or vice versa, a seven

2367
02:18:25,580 --> 02:18:27,740
day cruise and then three days at Disney World.

2368
02:18:28,940 --> 02:18:30,140
I don't know if I could handle it.

2369
02:18:30,780 --> 02:18:31,820
I want that jacket.

2370
02:18:33,020 --> 02:18:34,300
Bobby says, I've done it.

2371
02:18:34,300 --> 02:18:34,800
Dang.

2372
02:18:36,540 --> 02:18:37,040
All right.

2373
02:18:37,740 --> 02:18:40,620
So three days in the park and then relax on the cruise.

2374
02:18:40,620 --> 02:18:41,020
Maybe.

2375
02:18:41,020 --> 02:18:41,420
I don't know.

2376
02:18:41,420 --> 02:18:43,260
I gotta, I gotta think it through.

2377
02:18:43,260 --> 02:18:44,460
Like, I'm not gonna lie.

2378
02:18:44,460 --> 02:18:45,580
I'm fucking tempted.

2379
02:18:45,580 --> 02:18:51,260
And the fact that I have already paid for the cruise does mean that financially it might

2380
02:18:51,260 --> 02:18:52,700
be figureoutable.

2381
02:18:52,700 --> 02:18:55,340
I mean, technically we could always, Alan is coming to Dragon Con.

2382
02:18:55,340 --> 02:18:58,060
We can always go the week after Dragon Con, but then I'm going to be real tired after

2383
02:18:58,060 --> 02:18:58,620
Dragon Con.

2384
02:18:58,620 --> 02:19:05,820
So yeah, it's going to be, it's going to be, uh, it's going to be, I want to do it.

2385
02:19:05,820 --> 02:19:06,540
We'll just see.

2386
02:19:06,540 --> 02:19:08,460
Cause remember, Alan has to buy into this too.

2387
02:19:09,020 --> 02:19:12,700
And being separated from the cats for so long is, is rough.

2388
02:19:12,700 --> 02:19:15,660
But the cat sitting situation worked out this last time.

2389
02:19:15,660 --> 02:19:21,500
So, you know, it gives them a lot of, uh, uh, support in that department, I think.

2390
02:19:21,500 --> 02:19:23,900
But yeah, I really want to ride the Tron light cycle run.

2391
02:19:23,900 --> 02:19:25,260
I just don't know when I'll get out there.

2392
02:19:27,340 --> 02:19:27,840
We'll see.

2393
02:19:29,660 --> 02:19:35,420
Um, you know, honestly I've been getting enough reward points where I could probably book

2394
02:19:35,420 --> 02:19:37,340
a trip on reward points and make it happen.

2395
02:19:37,340 --> 02:19:39,580
I just have to figure out a time that works with my work schedule.

2396
02:19:40,620 --> 02:19:41,260
So we'll see.

2397
02:19:41,900 --> 02:19:44,300
You could come to Disneyland with me for my birthday.

2398
02:19:46,540 --> 02:19:52,140
You're unfortunately, I have an executive level presentation at work the week after

2399
02:19:52,140 --> 02:19:52,700
your birthday.

2400
02:19:53,500 --> 02:19:53,980
It's okay.

2401
02:19:54,620 --> 02:19:55,260
I'm sorry.

2402
02:19:56,380 --> 02:19:59,500
But that just means you have to go to Disneyland a second time and then we can go.

2403
02:20:01,820 --> 02:20:07,660
Well, um, I'll tell you what, I love when my friends meet me for Disneyland, but I also

2404
02:20:07,660 --> 02:20:13,020
do not mind going by myself at all because then I do the whole thing at my own pace.

2405
02:20:13,020 --> 02:20:13,520
Yeah.

2406
02:20:14,860 --> 02:20:15,660
I want to go.

2407
02:20:15,660 --> 02:20:17,740
I actually want to go to Disney world by myself.

2408
02:20:19,020 --> 02:20:21,260
Cause then you don't have to worry about anyone else.

2409
02:20:21,260 --> 02:20:22,620
Yeah, exactly.

2410
02:20:22,620 --> 02:20:23,260
Exactly.

2411
02:20:23,260 --> 02:20:28,460
And I'm like, I, I, I, people give me shit about it, but I don't like to be behind people

2412
02:20:28,460 --> 02:20:29,820
who are taller than me.

2413
02:20:29,820 --> 02:20:31,740
It just makes me feel nervous.

2414
02:20:31,740 --> 02:20:36,220
So I, I go into convention mode and weave through people and move around cause I like

2415
02:20:36,220 --> 02:20:37,580
to be able to see what's in front of me.

2416
02:20:38,140 --> 02:20:42,700
And like there, there's a lot of stuff that I would want to do and seriously do it by

2417
02:20:42,700 --> 02:20:45,500
myself so I can just do things the way I want to do them.

2418
02:20:45,500 --> 02:20:46,000
Yeah.

2419
02:20:46,860 --> 02:20:49,020
However, I've done Disneyland so many times it don't matter.

2420
02:20:50,620 --> 02:20:51,020
All right.

2421
02:20:51,020 --> 02:20:54,620
Um, I wanted to check in if there were any last minute stories while we wait to see if

2422
02:20:54,620 --> 02:20:56,700
there's any other comments that come in.

2423
02:20:56,700 --> 02:20:58,140
Um, but I'll check on last minute stories here.

2424
02:20:58,700 --> 02:20:58,940
Yeah.

2425
02:20:58,940 --> 02:21:05,820
There was a leak of a new Lego racing game that's coming out called Lego two K drive

2426
02:21:05,820 --> 02:21:10,700
and it was leaked by, um, having some screenshots of it being a show.

2427
02:21:10,700 --> 02:21:17,580
And I guess they're doing some sort of beta tests on the, like a PVP racing part of it,

2428
02:21:17,580 --> 02:21:23,020
but it looks sort of like a kind of set up like a Mario Kart type game.

2429
02:21:23,660 --> 02:21:28,780
And they've got different levels that are, I don't know if they're not really based off

2430
02:21:28,780 --> 02:21:29,500
of Lego sets.

2431
02:21:29,500 --> 02:21:30,940
It's just kind of different themes.

2432
02:21:30,940 --> 02:21:36,620
So you have like this runway roundabout that kind of has airplanes in it, rapid falls,

2433
02:21:36,620 --> 02:21:43,260
which kind of looks like a mountain, uh, swamp us, which is, you know, swamp, uh, cat, cat

2434
02:21:43,260 --> 02:21:47,420
scratch freeway, which has, it looks like a, like a cat tree in there.

2435
02:21:47,420 --> 02:21:49,020
And then it's like a race course.

2436
02:21:49,020 --> 02:21:54,940
I don't know if it has like a cat, like they did the new Jago movies, um, down on the farm,

2437
02:21:54,940 --> 02:21:58,780
which, you know, obviously it looks like a farm type thing, glazed overdrive.

2438
02:21:58,780 --> 02:22:06,540
It's got donuts and candy stuff everywhere and headless horsepower and chasm crossing.

2439
02:22:06,540 --> 02:22:07,500
So it looks pretty cool.

2440
02:22:08,780 --> 02:22:09,980
I'll play it when it comes out.

2441
02:22:09,980 --> 02:22:11,580
I like Mario Kart and I like Lego.

2442
02:22:11,580 --> 02:22:12,220
So of course.

2443
02:22:13,820 --> 02:22:14,220
All right.

2444
02:22:14,940 --> 02:22:18,780
Well with that, I believe we've reached the end of our show for tonight, but I want to

2445
02:22:18,780 --> 02:22:22,860
thank everybody for listening once again to Orange Lawns Radio, whether it was on the

2446
02:22:22,860 --> 02:22:27,900
podcast feed or live here at twitch.tv slash vog network on Sunday nights, we appreciate

2447
02:22:27,900 --> 02:22:31,740
you being a part of the experience and being a part of our family here on Sunday.

2448
02:22:31,740 --> 02:22:33,100
Thank you so much for being here.

2449
02:22:33,100 --> 02:22:36,140
And if you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Lawns Radio, tell a friend or two about

2450
02:22:36,140 --> 02:22:39,260
the show, help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice,

2451
02:22:39,260 --> 02:22:44,220
but we need more voices here to put out on air and a nice five star review on a site

2452
02:22:44,220 --> 02:22:48,620
like iTunes, Spotify, wherever it is, you found this podcast, those go an awful long

2453
02:22:48,620 --> 02:22:50,620
way, uh, you know, come join us.

2454
02:22:50,620 --> 02:22:55,900
We're on the road to a thousand weekly episodes, uh, coming up in, uh, next year.

2455
02:22:55,900 --> 02:22:58,140
So it's gonna be, gonna be something.

2456
02:22:58,140 --> 02:23:03,180
So, um, that right around the time that I may or may not go to Disney world and, uh,

2457
02:23:03,180 --> 02:23:04,700
the Star Trek cruise we'll see.

2458
02:23:04,700 --> 02:23:06,700
So, uh, but that is coming up.

2459
02:23:06,700 --> 02:23:13,180
So join us as we count the road to a thousand weekly episodes, 48 more to go after tonight.

2460
02:23:13,180 --> 02:23:13,680
All right.

2461
02:23:14,380 --> 02:23:17,500
With that, let's wrap it all up for tonight.

2462
02:23:17,500 --> 02:23:21,100
Dark Sakura, um, I know you're doing some streaming after the show tonight.

2463
02:23:21,100 --> 02:23:22,140
I hope you have some fun.

2464
02:23:22,700 --> 02:23:25,980
Sorry, I'm assuming you're swiffing tonight and, uh, yeetin.

2465
02:23:27,180 --> 02:23:32,380
Um, actually two of the team yeet may be showing up a little bit later.

2466
02:23:32,380 --> 02:23:37,020
Um, but if Gwen's down to play, I'm down to have Gwen in.

2467
02:23:37,580 --> 02:23:40,300
Might, might, might, might, one of my favorite people to play with.

2468
02:23:41,020 --> 02:23:45,580
And, uh, other than that, I'm gonna be an annoying killer.

2469
02:23:46,460 --> 02:23:47,100
Sounds good.

2470
02:23:47,100 --> 02:23:51,500
And if Gwen does play, I'm, I'm casting a protective bubble around Gwen because those

2471
02:23:51,500 --> 02:23:54,060
killers always pick on her and I hate to see it.

2472
02:23:54,060 --> 02:23:55,260
So I'm cast, I'm doing it.

2473
02:23:55,260 --> 02:23:59,500
I'm casting a protective bubble around Gwen so that she's not tunneled by killers tonight.

2474
02:23:59,500 --> 02:24:00,000
All right.

2475
02:24:00,700 --> 02:24:01,980
Have a good stream.

2476
02:24:01,980 --> 02:24:02,380
Bye.

2477
02:24:02,380 --> 02:24:04,460
I have, have fun storming the castle.

2478
02:24:04,460 --> 02:24:05,260
Will do.

2479
02:24:05,260 --> 02:24:05,900
I think it'll work.

2480
02:24:06,540 --> 02:24:07,740
It'll take a miracle.

2481
02:24:07,740 --> 02:24:08,380
Bye.

2482
02:24:08,380 --> 02:24:08,880
Bye.

2483
02:24:09,500 --> 02:24:10,140
All right.

2484
02:24:10,140 --> 02:24:12,300
Uh, Loki, your final thought for tonight?

2485
02:24:12,300 --> 02:24:19,660
My final thought is I, I pasted a link in chat for the Resident Evil 4 anime that is

2486
02:24:19,660 --> 02:24:23,900
apparently part of their marketing plan for the Resident Evil 4 game.

2487
02:24:23,900 --> 02:24:25,660
It's done by Nippon Animation.

2488
02:24:25,660 --> 02:24:26,620
It's ridiculous.

2489
02:24:28,540 --> 02:24:29,040
All right.

2490
02:24:30,140 --> 02:24:34,780
Uh, my final thought, I'm gonna probably go play some more Diablo 4 and get the most I

2491
02:24:34,780 --> 02:24:38,380
can out of this beta, see if I can get all the way to 25 during the beta.

2492
02:24:38,380 --> 02:24:40,300
Uh, but that's, that's it.

2493
02:24:40,300 --> 02:24:43,660
I'm having a great time and I can't wait to, uh, level another character next weekend.

2494
02:24:43,660 --> 02:24:47,100
So, um, and I'll be doing some streaming hopefully too.

2495
02:24:47,180 --> 02:24:50,060
Hopefully now that the network issues have stabilized a little bit, cause that's, I didn't

2496
02:24:50,060 --> 02:24:53,420
stream on Friday cause it took like an hour and a half to get in and even then you would

2497
02:24:53,420 --> 02:24:57,900
get disconnected sometimes, but it seems like they worked a lot of that out for Saturday,

2498
02:24:57,900 --> 02:24:58,300
Sunday.

2499
02:24:58,300 --> 02:25:00,940
So hooray, the beta is working as intended.

2500
02:25:00,940 --> 02:25:01,980
So that's good.

2501
02:25:01,980 --> 02:25:04,940
So hopefully next week it'll be a little more stable and I can do some streaming, but a

2502
02:25:04,940 --> 02:25:08,780
lot of people have been streaming it honestly, if you, uh, uh, want to check that out.

2503
02:25:08,780 --> 02:25:11,580
So that's good to do it for another episode of Orange Launch Radio.

2504
02:25:11,580 --> 02:25:13,420
Thank you all so much for being here.

2505
02:25:13,420 --> 02:25:14,380
