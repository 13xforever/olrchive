00:00.000 --> 00:13.760
Video gaming merchandise has been an ever-growing thing, but thus far you haven't often seen

00:13.760 --> 00:16.680
a game's name in a grocery or other common personal goods store.

00:16.680 --> 00:21.280
But now, a 1980s stalwart and a 2010s breakout are both landing on more shelves.

00:21.280 --> 00:24.680
One of them is part of a balanced breakfast, and the other keeps you fresh, clean, and

00:24.680 --> 00:25.680
smooth.

00:25.680 --> 00:27.280
Guess which games, and guess which products.

00:27.280 --> 00:30.040
We're the ThinkGeek, and you're not going to see these on GameStop shelves.

00:30.040 --> 00:32.960
Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you which

00:32.960 --> 00:36.000
of these and about the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now on the show

00:36.000 --> 00:39.800
where every gamer has a voice.

00:39.800 --> 00:44.280
Hello my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show

00:44.280 --> 00:46.600
where every gamer has a voice.

00:46.600 --> 00:55.040
It is Orange Lounge Radio, and we are live here once again with episode number 953 of

00:55.040 --> 00:59.000
our show for tonight, March the 26th of 2023.

00:59.000 --> 01:04.120
My name is Rob Roberts, and I am joined week, after week, after week, after week, after

01:04.120 --> 01:06.060
week by my co-hosts.

01:06.060 --> 01:08.240
Say hello to Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.

01:08.240 --> 01:09.240
What's up?

01:09.240 --> 01:10.800
Hi, how are you doing?

01:10.800 --> 01:12.160
I'm all right.

01:12.160 --> 01:16.080
Did you hear, by the way, have you heard the latest news about my husband?

01:16.080 --> 01:19.080
Something about a ban?

01:19.080 --> 01:22.280
Yes, he's in Twitch jail right now.

01:22.280 --> 01:23.280
Why?

01:23.320 --> 01:28.880
Okay, so he loves to stream games with mods, right?

01:28.880 --> 01:36.200
So he was running a mod for Final Fantasy 7 Remake that was showing Cloud running around

01:36.200 --> 01:37.700
in a jockstrap.

01:37.700 --> 01:43.440
So his little booty was hanging out, and somebody decided that those assets were too hot for

01:43.440 --> 01:47.640
TV, and so he was delivered with a three-day ban in the middle of the stream with four

01:47.640 --> 01:52.080
viewers watching, which, here's the thing.

01:52.080 --> 01:54.680
Diablo 4 is like all the rage right now.

01:54.680 --> 01:58.960
Don't get me wrong, I love Diablo 4, but half of Twitch is streaming that limited access

01:58.960 --> 02:00.420
beta right now, right?

02:00.420 --> 02:06.220
And all of that death, dismemberment, violence, destruction, decapitation, you name it, all

02:06.220 --> 02:07.880
going on in that game.

02:07.880 --> 02:13.920
But, pun intended, Allen decides to show a risque mod, and he gets banned.

02:13.920 --> 02:18.540
Now look, I'm not complaining about what Twitch is doing, because Allen knew he was toeing

02:18.540 --> 02:19.540
the line.

02:19.940 --> 02:23.500
He knew it was a little risky what he was doing, so he's a big boy and can take the

02:23.500 --> 02:24.740
big boy punishment.

02:24.740 --> 02:28.340
But I am pointing out, there's a double standard here going on, folks.

02:28.340 --> 02:29.340
And I-

02:29.340 --> 02:31.340
How many years have I been saying that?

02:31.340 --> 02:32.820
Oh, forever.

02:32.820 --> 02:39.720
And how much do you want to bet if that mod had been a lady, it would not have been quick

02:39.720 --> 02:41.060
to have been reported?

02:41.060 --> 02:42.060
And that's just-

02:42.060 --> 02:43.060
No, it probably would have been-

02:43.060 --> 02:44.060
Facts are facts.

02:44.060 --> 02:45.060
Our bodies are policed a lot more.

02:45.580 --> 02:49.700
It would have been like, you know, that needs to go in the hot tub streaming section.

02:49.700 --> 02:54.060
I mean, this is in the wrong section, just letting you know.

02:54.060 --> 02:55.060
So-

02:55.060 --> 03:01.280
Our bodies are policed more and sexualized more, so I'd be surprised if it went on longer.

03:01.280 --> 03:07.100
So it's just, I don't know, I can't help but think maybe even somebody we know or somebody

03:07.100 --> 03:11.040
had actually reported that, but I like to believe that the universe has a nice little

03:11.040 --> 03:13.340
way of dealing with those types of people.

03:13.340 --> 03:14.480
So I will just kind of, you know-

03:14.480 --> 03:15.480
It's an auto-detect algorithm.

03:15.480 --> 03:16.480
What's that?

03:16.480 --> 03:20.120
Or it could have been an auto-detect.

03:20.120 --> 03:22.280
It wasn't his first time running that mod.

03:22.280 --> 03:23.280
It was a few streams in.

03:23.280 --> 03:27.160
So, I mean, and again, I'm not mad about, and neither is he, about what happened.

03:27.160 --> 03:29.860
It's just one of those things where it's like, it's just a ridiculous double standard in

03:29.860 --> 03:35.640
our society that the violence, you know, and even when it comes to Twitch or whatever it

03:35.640 --> 03:43.600
is, an R-rated movie or what have you allows a certain amount of risqueness to it that

03:43.600 --> 03:46.400
for whatever reason Twitch does not mirror.

03:46.400 --> 03:49.920
And that's, you know, again, that's okay, but I just, it's a bit of a double standard.

03:49.920 --> 03:54.540
I think the violence should be policed just as much if we're going to do that, so.

03:54.540 --> 03:57.920
That's pretty much been the cry of women everywhere.

03:57.920 --> 04:02.880
I mean, having our bodies policed when violence is certainly allowed everywhere.

04:02.880 --> 04:03.880
Yeah.

04:03.880 --> 04:04.880
I agree.

04:05.120 --> 04:07.120
Anyway, also say hello.

04:07.120 --> 04:08.120
Sorry.

04:08.120 --> 04:09.400
I know you heard his voice in there too, but I also want to-

04:09.400 --> 04:13.640
That has nothing to do with body positivity, I'm just saying.

04:13.640 --> 04:14.640
Whatever happens.

04:14.640 --> 04:19.360
The two should not be, should be remotely combined.

04:19.360 --> 04:24.120
I feel like I might know what angle he's taking with that comment is that like, to me, I read

04:24.120 --> 04:26.720
that comment to be like, it's just a butt.

04:26.720 --> 04:30.800
And that's how, that's like art butts, whatever, like, and that's how I kind of look at it

04:30.800 --> 04:32.800
is that it's just a butt, people.

04:32.800 --> 04:33.800
It's just a butt.

04:33.800 --> 04:36.600
Positively- It's not even a real butt.

04:36.600 --> 04:39.520
Is a different thing than just someone showing their ass.

04:39.520 --> 04:40.520
No.

04:40.520 --> 04:41.520
So.

04:41.520 --> 04:42.520
Anyway, hello, Techmaster Loki.

04:42.520 --> 04:43.520
How are you?

04:43.520 --> 04:44.520
I'm fine.

04:44.520 --> 04:45.520
Yeah.

04:45.520 --> 04:46.520
And how's your week been?

04:46.520 --> 04:47.520
Yeah, it's been all right.

04:47.520 --> 04:48.520
Yeah.

04:48.520 --> 04:49.840
What's that game playing behind you tonight?

04:49.840 --> 04:50.840
Red Dead Redemption 2.

04:50.840 --> 04:53.720
Oh, is that, so I thought it was Red Dead Redemption, but I wasn't positive.

04:53.720 --> 04:54.720
Okay.

04:54.720 --> 04:55.720
Fair enough.

04:55.720 --> 04:56.720
All right.

04:56.720 --> 04:57.720
Let's see.

04:57.720 --> 05:00.700
We do tape live, of course, every Sunday night at nine o'clock Eastern, six o'clock Pacific

05:00.700 --> 05:06.520
at the Voice of Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash vog network, right after the Bobby Blackwolf

05:06.520 --> 05:07.980
show.

05:07.980 --> 05:12.740
And if you are watching along with the show, you can chat along with us.

05:12.740 --> 05:18.020
So I'm sorry, I'm laughing at a comment about something that happened before the podcast.

05:18.020 --> 05:25.660
And yes, the little joke bump that plays at the beginning when we go live, it was a joke

05:25.660 --> 05:30.300
about AI tonight, and I'm getting asked for screenshots about what we actually got the

05:30.300 --> 05:31.500
AI to say.

05:31.500 --> 05:35.940
And yes, I'm happy to send those over later after the show, I'll post them on Discord.

05:35.940 --> 05:36.940
Let's see.

05:36.940 --> 05:37.940
Yeah.

05:37.940 --> 05:42.180
Dark Tetsuya appreciates the joke about assets, yes.

05:42.180 --> 05:47.920
Questbuster talking about the AI joke, a Chinese company actually did appoint an AI as a CEO.

05:47.920 --> 05:48.960
Not joking, really.

05:48.960 --> 05:50.620
I had not heard about that.

05:50.620 --> 05:56.140
I'd be very curious, because this is all the rage now, and we even have a story later on

05:56.140 --> 05:57.140
in the show about it this week.

05:57.140 --> 05:59.500
I'd be very curious to kind of know more about that.

05:59.500 --> 06:05.060
So anyway, for the sake of the podcast listeners, one of the quote unquote jokes I put in there

06:05.060 --> 06:07.220
as I asked, it was Google Bard.

06:07.220 --> 06:12.700
And I asked, I said, do you think Bobby Kotick should be CEO of Activision?

06:12.700 --> 06:18.100
And it actually spit out a response and said, these are all the things that he's done wrong.

06:18.100 --> 06:23.340
And for these reasons, including basically his rampant, all the sexual harassment that

06:23.340 --> 06:26.180
went on Activision Blizzard while he was over, he should be fired.

06:26.180 --> 06:30.860
And I was like, Google Bard, smarter than the board at Activision Blizzard.

06:30.860 --> 06:34.260
I think an actual turd would make a better CEO.

06:34.260 --> 06:35.260
Agree.

06:35.260 --> 06:36.580
Actual AI would make a better CEO.

06:36.580 --> 06:43.760
No, no, I'm saying I can dig a turd out of my cat box and maybe a P clump, and that would

06:43.760 --> 06:45.660
do better than him.

06:45.660 --> 06:46.660
I agree.

06:46.660 --> 06:48.380
All right.

06:48.380 --> 06:53.500
Let's get into our official story at the top here before we get into our gaming weeks.

06:53.500 --> 06:54.500
Let's talk about this.

06:54.500 --> 06:57.700
This is interesting because it kind of has to do with, you know, we've been talking about

06:57.700 --> 07:02.940
Diablo 4 and a lot of games that we play right now in this day and age are always online.

07:02.940 --> 07:07.900
And this used to be something you would get a lot more pushback on, but that kind of seems

07:07.900 --> 07:09.400
to have faded a lot in the last few years.

07:09.400 --> 07:12.180
I kind of wanted to dissect that a little bit, but first let's talk about like what's

07:12.180 --> 07:13.980
happening with the whole back and forth on that.

07:13.980 --> 07:15.960
Loki, I'll turn it over to you.

07:15.960 --> 07:20.940
So basically they had announced that Redfall was going to have a, I think it has a single

07:20.940 --> 07:25.120
player campaign and that it's still always online as well.

07:25.120 --> 07:29.140
So if you wanted to play, you know, single player, then you're stuck being connected

07:29.140 --> 07:30.220
to the internet.

07:30.220 --> 07:34.700
And of course people were not happy with that and let their voices be heard.

07:34.700 --> 07:41.220
And so because of that, the game director Harvey Smith said that, you know, they have,

07:41.220 --> 07:46.420
they've listened to the players and have a lot of empathy for folks who don't have consistent

07:46.420 --> 07:47.420
internet connections.

07:47.420 --> 07:52.060
Because we do take complaints about always online with a lot of empathy, we listen and

07:52.060 --> 07:55.140
we've already started work to address this.

07:55.140 --> 08:02.020
And in the future, we have some things like to encrypt your saves and do a bunch of UI

08:02.020 --> 08:03.020
work to support it.

08:03.020 --> 08:08.140
And we're looking into, I'm not supposed to promise anything, but we're looking into working

08:08.140 --> 08:13.620
actively towards fixing that in the future.

08:13.620 --> 08:17.640
So there, yeah, I don't know.

08:17.640 --> 08:21.020
So why did it require an online connection in the first place?

08:21.020 --> 08:26.780
Well, I guess, you know, in-game purchases, it says always online allowed us to do some

08:26.780 --> 08:28.980
accessibility stuff.

08:28.980 --> 08:31.500
I'm really, my eyes really big there.

08:31.500 --> 08:34.020
It allows us for telemetries.

08:34.020 --> 08:40.140
Like if everybody's fallen off ladders and dying, you know, then we can go tweak the

08:40.140 --> 08:41.140
ladder code.

08:41.140 --> 08:44.820
I mean, I don't know.

08:44.820 --> 08:48.880
I don't think that other games don't necessarily do that.

08:48.880 --> 08:55.860
Like you could have that without being always online because people would report bugs to

08:55.860 --> 08:57.960
you and then you go and fix those bugs.

08:57.960 --> 09:01.080
Like that's kind of what you do with that.

09:01.080 --> 09:05.740
Like you wouldn't, like, are you really going to be looking at all that data?

09:05.740 --> 09:08.100
I doubt it.

09:08.100 --> 09:11.260
A comment from Bobby Blackwolf in our chat saying they've been doing this telemetry stuff

09:11.260 --> 09:12.260
forever though.

09:12.260 --> 09:13.820
It doesn't need to be always online.

09:13.820 --> 09:16.340
They just upload data at other times.

09:16.340 --> 09:20.740
So but Bobby says they do look at that data.

09:20.740 --> 09:25.780
I wonder if it's, you know, I think sometimes we have the impression they don't look at

09:25.780 --> 09:28.620
the data piece by piece and they probably don't look at the data piece by piece.

09:28.620 --> 09:32.220
They look at trends and big, big clumps of data.

09:32.220 --> 09:37.300
Yeah, they would like, they probably would use it to further back up, like say someone's

09:37.300 --> 09:40.460
like saying, hey, you know, going back to the ladder issue.

09:40.460 --> 09:43.540
Yeah, I'm having an issue, you know, being able to climb that ladder.

09:43.540 --> 09:48.500
They can then go look at, you know, that ladder object or whatever and seeing people interact

09:48.500 --> 09:52.960
with it and can get a better idea of like, is this an isolated issue?

09:52.960 --> 09:55.420
Is this something that all the players are experiencing?

09:55.420 --> 10:00.940
Yeah, it helps with further bolster and I guess prioritize errors that they need to

10:00.940 --> 10:05.220
fix or tweaks or rebalances, whatever that type of stuff.

10:05.220 --> 10:09.580
But if that were the case, that all the games are doing that, which they're not, then everything

10:09.580 --> 10:11.020
would be always online.

10:11.020 --> 10:13.460
So I think there's other ways around that.

10:13.460 --> 10:14.460
Yeah.

10:14.460 --> 10:18.260
Comments in chat as Joe and Matt says, it's all about keeping the game from being pirated

10:18.260 --> 10:19.260
as well.

10:19.260 --> 10:23.740
You know, I was just thinking the other day, I don't hear a lot about torrents anymore.

10:23.740 --> 10:25.660
I'm sure I'm not being completely naive.

10:25.660 --> 10:27.540
Yes, I know it's all still out there, folks.

10:27.540 --> 10:32.740
I'm not like completely naive, but I feel like a lot of that isn't as like piracy doesn't

10:32.740 --> 10:36.900
feel as mainstream now as it used to feel.

10:36.900 --> 10:40.940
And I don't know if a lot of that is because of like streaming and the capabilities that

10:40.940 --> 10:41.940
is brought.

10:41.940 --> 10:46.780
Like I, and here's the thing, you know, if you want to take piracy way, way back to like

10:46.780 --> 10:54.580
the late nineties, early aughts when it was, yeah, LimeWire, Napster, what was the other

10:54.580 --> 10:55.580
big one?

10:55.580 --> 10:59.060
But there were all these ways to, you know, the peer to peer file transferring and all

10:59.060 --> 11:02.400
that stuff where we were basically pirating music.

11:02.400 --> 11:09.600
But then what happened to the industry iTunes happened, iTunes happened and it didn't completely

11:09.600 --> 11:12.920
shut that down, but boy, oh boy, did it scale it way back and sure.

11:12.920 --> 11:16.480
There was still torrents of, you know, a CD quality albums and things like that.

11:16.480 --> 11:18.060
And that all is still out there, I'm sure.

11:18.060 --> 11:23.000
But especially not just iTunes, but now that we've taken that and transitioned into Apple

11:23.000 --> 11:28.840
music, Spotify, Pandora, you name it, all these, you know, what's the title, you know,

11:28.840 --> 11:33.660
all these, you know, different music streaming services, it's just not nearly as prevalent

11:33.660 --> 11:39.600
because the option is still there to do these streamings and get that like instant gratification

11:39.600 --> 11:41.360
of like, whatever it is you're looking for.

11:41.360 --> 11:45.560
And a lot of streaming TV services seem to do this now, which is why I feel like there's

11:45.560 --> 11:47.760
less and less of the piracy that's going on.

11:47.760 --> 11:48.760
Yeah.

11:48.760 --> 11:53.780
And I don't think that they have anything for like the Xbox series S or X right now

11:53.780 --> 11:56.400
that there is like even a piracy scene for it.

11:56.400 --> 12:01.580
I mean, at some point, if they, you know, exploit the console in a way that they can

12:01.580 --> 12:05.800
do that, then yeah, that might be a thing like the Xbox 360 is really bad.

12:05.800 --> 12:09.640
But and I, again, I don't, I want to make sure I'm very clear on this.

12:09.640 --> 12:12.360
I'm not naive to the fact that piracy still exists.

12:12.360 --> 12:14.400
Of course it still exists and it's going on out there.

12:14.400 --> 12:21.520
I'm just saying the percentage of average Joes and Janes and, you know, folks out there

12:21.520 --> 12:25.760
that are participating in that seems to be lower.

12:25.760 --> 12:27.760
I mean, that could be a confirmation bias or personal thing.

12:27.760 --> 12:28.760
I don't know.

12:28.760 --> 12:32.920
But I just, I feel like we're not, like even on like Twitter and social media, we don't

12:32.920 --> 12:37.480
see people as brazen about posting that type of stuff anymore that we used to.

12:37.480 --> 12:45.280
I feel like that level of the mainstreamization of piracy in a way is scaled back a little

12:45.280 --> 12:46.400
bit, especially when it comes to games.

12:46.400 --> 12:48.880
It just doesn't seem like it's as big of a threat as it used to be.

12:48.880 --> 12:49.880
Yeah.

12:49.880 --> 12:54.560
I think a lot of like Xbox right now, the closest thing that you have with that is just,

12:54.560 --> 12:58.200
you know, there's stuff being run in the dev mode, but that's more like emulators and

12:58.200 --> 12:59.200
stuff like that.

12:59.200 --> 13:04.000
That's less, you know, I don't think anyone's actually pirating anything with that.

13:04.000 --> 13:09.000
I mean, obviously torrent stuff nowadays, TV shows, movies, that type of stuff for the

13:09.000 --> 13:14.040
most part, software, maybe PC game piracy to a certain extent.

13:14.040 --> 13:18.280
Although I would think that that's probably dropped down even still, although now that

13:18.280 --> 13:23.800
games are going back up to $70, you know, even PC, that might kick back up again.

13:24.200 --> 13:28.240
If the games can run offline, which a lot of them in this day and age don't anymore,

13:28.240 --> 13:29.240
it seems like.

13:29.240 --> 13:37.220
Well, I mean, there's patches for everything, so I wouldn't say that, yeah, like your typical

13:37.220 --> 13:41.600
retail game may not run, you know, always online, but I mean, we've learned things like

13:41.600 --> 13:42.600
remember SimCity?

13:42.600 --> 13:45.760
Oh yeah, it's impossible for that to run.

13:45.760 --> 13:46.760
Good point.

13:46.760 --> 13:47.760
Good point.

13:47.760 --> 13:48.760
Except it wasn't.

13:48.760 --> 13:49.760
Point taken.

13:50.760 --> 13:54.160
It's just interesting to me because I feel like, okay, so I'm also looking at a lot of

13:54.160 --> 13:57.920
things through the lens of this Diablo 4 beta that's going on this weekend, and you know,

13:57.920 --> 14:03.440
there's a limited beta last weekend, and obviously I'm a big Diablo fan, but Diablo 4, as far

14:03.440 --> 14:07.240
as I know, and chat, please correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't see how I am on this

14:07.240 --> 14:11.480
because the queue issues are a big issue to get into the game, but Diablo 4 isn't always

14:11.480 --> 14:21.140
online game, as was Diablo 3, and Diablo 3 got a lot of shit about always being online.

14:21.140 --> 14:25.840
So much so that when the console versions of Diablo 3 came out, they were offline and

14:25.840 --> 14:26.920
it was a selling point.

14:26.920 --> 14:30.920
Now granted, Diablo 3 also had this huge problem.

14:30.920 --> 14:34.300
Remember what Diablo 3 looks like today and what it looked like the day it launched are

14:34.300 --> 14:37.960
very different products because the other thing Diablo 3 had that people did not like

14:37.960 --> 14:43.360
was that real money auction house, hence the reason why it had to always be online.

14:43.360 --> 14:48.880
Now Diablo 4 doesn't have a real money auction house because Activision Blizzard done learned

14:48.880 --> 14:54.560
their lesson from that whole thing, but it does have cosmetics, the battle pass, a lot

14:54.560 --> 14:59.480
of things that games as a service kind of have, although Blizzard swears up and down,

14:59.480 --> 15:03.560
they're not going to tie that to content, so we'll see if they're true to their word

15:03.560 --> 15:06.200
on all of that.

15:06.200 --> 15:13.960
But I guess my point is, I feel like the buzz about Diablo 4 being always online, I'm not

15:13.960 --> 15:16.660
seeing people complain about that.

15:16.660 --> 15:21.760
Have we just gotten to a point here a decade later that we just assume that a lot of games

15:21.760 --> 15:25.280
are going to require an online connection and we don't care as much about that anymore?

15:25.280 --> 15:26.800
That's really the point I'm trying to get to.

15:26.800 --> 15:31.340
Do we as gamers just accept that more games are just, they're always going to be online

15:31.340 --> 15:34.120
because that's the way games are?

15:34.120 --> 15:37.840
They're connected and whether that be because they're really trying to push multiplayer

15:37.840 --> 15:43.360
or it's a game as a service and all the things that come with that, your battle passes, cosmetics,

15:43.360 --> 15:49.760
your shops and all that, although single player games, the very first Ludicrous DLC was for

15:49.760 --> 15:54.920
a single player game and that's Elder Scrolls Oblivion and the horse armor that set the

15:54.920 --> 15:57.540
standard for all cosmetic DLC to follow.

15:57.540 --> 16:01.440
That was a single player game, so you don't have to always have a game online to do that

16:01.440 --> 16:04.200
type of stuff, but I digress.

16:04.200 --> 16:07.580
I'm curious, what do you all think about this?

16:07.580 --> 16:09.640
Do you think we as gamers accept this now?

16:09.640 --> 16:12.080
Let me get some comments from chat.

16:12.080 --> 16:17.240
Questbuster says, I accept that more games are always going to be online, but I don't

16:17.240 --> 16:18.640
have to like it.

16:18.640 --> 16:19.640
Fair enough.

16:19.640 --> 16:24.240
Fifth Dream brings up a point about the annoyingness of games being online sometimes.

16:24.240 --> 16:31.160
That rubber banding, even when you're soloing in, I think Diablo, oh, DIV, D4, why don't

16:31.160 --> 16:32.160
you just put D4?

16:32.160 --> 16:35.160
Why do you put the Roman numerals?

16:35.160 --> 16:36.800
I was like, what's DIV?

16:36.800 --> 16:38.160
Okay, I get it.

16:38.160 --> 16:39.160
I get it.

16:39.160 --> 16:40.160
I get it.

16:40.160 --> 16:42.720
Even when you're soloing in D4 is eh.

16:42.720 --> 16:44.560
So yeah, and then the monsters are that.

16:44.560 --> 16:47.520
So yeah, there are some annoyances that come with the always online thing too, is that

16:47.520 --> 16:50.800
like even when you're solo player, you're going to encounter issues.

16:50.800 --> 16:55.480
Now I chalk a lot of these things up to the fact it's a beta and hopefully they iron some

16:55.480 --> 16:57.040
of these things out before June.

16:57.040 --> 17:00.520
I actually wasn't having a lot of problems with rubber banding though, to be quite honest.

17:00.520 --> 17:05.640
I wasn't having, my problems seem to be more graphical in nature for high end stuff and

17:05.640 --> 17:10.680
I actually took my graphics down a setting to get it to work, but I noticed they released

17:10.680 --> 17:14.120
updated drivers and that might actually fix my issue.

17:14.120 --> 17:15.120
I don't know.

17:15.120 --> 17:20.640
But I am chalking a lot of this up to just, you know, the lovely parts of a beta.

17:20.640 --> 17:23.080
But anyway, let me go back to the question at hand.

17:23.080 --> 17:27.760
Do you think that we as gamers have just accepted that more and more games are going to be online?

17:28.280 --> 17:31.240
Do any of my co-hosts have a standpoint on this?

17:31.240 --> 17:35.840
I mean, if it makes sense, like in the sense of a game, like if it's it's a multiplayer game or

17:35.840 --> 17:39.760
something like that, that requires all always online connection.

17:39.760 --> 17:46.800
But I think for like a single player game where conceivable, there's no real reason to have that

17:46.800 --> 17:49.080
type of connection.

17:49.080 --> 17:52.760
It really shouldn't be because we've seen examples where this just fails.

17:52.760 --> 17:57.040
Like Assassin's Creed had a lot of those games that were always online.

17:57.040 --> 18:02.840
And when their authentication servers go down, well, hey, now you can't play your single player game.

18:03.400 --> 18:07.200
You know, like that's really stupid to be designing a game like that.

18:07.200 --> 18:09.160
And for what reason were they doing that?

18:09.160 --> 18:10.960
Probably monetization.

18:10.960 --> 18:16.000
You know, they'll probably make some excuse like, oh, it was telemetry, whatever, you know, like.

18:16.360 --> 18:21.840
But in the end, like when those servers go down, then news reports go out about how, oh, hey, look

18:21.840 --> 18:23.840
at this unnecessary thing that's going on.

18:23.880 --> 18:30.320
Like it really. I don't think it's absolutely necessary to have an always online connection for things.

18:30.320 --> 18:35.960
I know in the past it was because like, hey, this is one other way we're going to try to stave off piracy, which never worked.

18:35.960 --> 18:37.120
It never did.

18:38.200 --> 18:41.200
So. I don't know the reason.

18:41.200 --> 18:45.120
Typically, the reason that they want to do that isn't for the benefit of the player.

18:45.360 --> 18:47.880
It's for the benefit of the company and to make more money.

18:47.960 --> 18:49.560
That's typically why they're doing it.

18:49.800 --> 18:51.560
Hashtag blame telemetry.

18:51.880 --> 18:58.240
All right. It's not telemetry, it's usually not telemetry, it is monetization.

18:58.240 --> 19:02.280
Like it typically is the reason why that they want that always online.

19:02.280 --> 19:09.600
So that so that you nasty cheaters out there can't get that item that you're supposed to be paying five dollars for or something like that.

19:09.600 --> 19:12.160
Like it's that it's about control.

19:13.040 --> 19:15.080
Did you want to elaborate, Jamin, before I go to chat?

19:16.240 --> 19:20.080
Well, I mean, I would hope I would have had a turn to say my piece.

19:20.480 --> 19:28.240
Of course. But I I'm always against the always online thing, except in the case of multiplayer.

19:28.240 --> 19:40.360
I think that if you're trying to check for like a cheat, then there should be like an initial, you know, check for, you know, any bad stuff that shouldn't be there and then let you play the game.

19:40.680 --> 19:47.440
I mean. I back in the day, there were other ways to know if the game was pirated.

19:47.440 --> 20:02.520
I mean, if if it was like you would get to a point of the game and you couldn't play it because it wasn't official software or it would come up with a message that says, hey, thank you for trying the game by the full version, you know, because they knew about it.

20:03.000 --> 20:04.320
You know, it's.

20:05.720 --> 20:07.880
It's it's it's unnecessary.

20:07.880 --> 20:12.200
We we were fine without it before, you know, I.

20:13.800 --> 20:16.240
It's just about control, it's controlling their product.

20:16.240 --> 20:17.880
It's it's loss prevention.

20:18.360 --> 20:22.120
It's I mean, and yeah, monetization can be a big part of it.

20:22.120 --> 20:32.800
But in the end, it's wanting to make sure that that their asset is protected, that they're actually making the money on the asset and not, you know, the copies are not there.

20:33.960 --> 20:45.960
And who cares if somebody cheats in single player that used it that that was old gaming was cheating in single player, you know, and we can sit here in our fucking rocking chairs being like, I remember when I used up

20:45.960 --> 20:53.680
up, down, down, left, right, to be able to get through the first stage, Gradius and get my Contra lives, except for Jamie, who's saying they're going, I don't need the 30 lives code.

20:55.080 --> 20:57.040
Oh, come on. I suck at Gradius.

20:58.400 --> 21:01.200
Sorry, I was transitioning into Contra there, but yes.

21:01.400 --> 21:04.680
Oh, well, Contra, I don't know anyone.

21:05.000 --> 21:12.000
OK, I take that back. Dan's good at Contra, but like I actually do not enjoy playing Contra for the record.

21:12.760 --> 21:19.400
I enjoy playing it for a little bit, but I, you know, it's a fun throwback, you know, anyway.

21:19.720 --> 21:22.040
I've never actually enjoyed playing a Contra game.

21:22.320 --> 21:28.280
We have some really good insight from chat and I want to get some of these comments here because I think this is really interesting.

21:29.080 --> 21:33.040
Fixation Gaze in chat says the cool thing about cheating has died.

21:33.240 --> 21:36.240
Modding now feels more like how cheat codes used to be.

21:36.240 --> 21:39.480
Well, it also kind of feels like that people are selling cheat codes now.

21:39.720 --> 21:50.840
You know, why allow you to do up, up, down, down 30 lives when I can sell you a life kit that has extra lives in it, which is what a lot of games do these days, right?

21:52.200 --> 21:55.400
I thought this was a really insightful comment, actually.

21:55.400 --> 21:58.440
This is just about a gold star level comment to me.

21:58.440 --> 21:59.680
This is silver star level.

22:00.320 --> 22:04.200
It's from zenmonkey11 who says zoomers accept all that crap.

22:04.560 --> 22:07.960
They grew up with consoles that connect to the Internet, so they don't care.

22:08.280 --> 22:12.760
I care. That's why I don't buy always online games if I can help it.

22:13.080 --> 22:19.840
I actually thought that was very interesting because you even think about that term zoomers and how that generation got that term.

22:20.200 --> 22:32.200
And that's because of, you know, the fact that we've got a whole generation of kids who've grown up now with a couple of years in online school and Zoom school and being connected and finding connections for birthday parties.

22:32.240 --> 22:34.760
I mean, we all had to go through it with the pandemic lockdowns.

22:35.120 --> 22:38.760
But, you know, now especially we have a generation that's grown up on that.

22:38.760 --> 22:41.320
So it almost kind of leads to that whole thought of.

22:43.040 --> 22:52.120
And again, I'm not trying to make it like an age, I'm not trying to be like I'm not trying to make broad stroke judgments based solely on age.

22:52.120 --> 23:04.320
However, you know, is it possible that younger folks, because there's that always online connection in these other ways, have just grown up to accept that there is going to

23:04.320 --> 23:12.560
always be a sense of always being connected online because sometimes, as we've unfortunately learned, that may be all the connection there is at some points.

23:13.400 --> 23:15.360
I don't know. I thought that was a very interesting perspective.

23:17.760 --> 23:18.960
Some other comments in chat.

23:19.360 --> 23:25.640
Let's see. Sean322 says, I don't mind always being online as long as someone doesn't pick up the phone and disconnect me.

23:25.760 --> 23:28.400
Oh, sorry. Flashback from the AOL dial up days.

23:28.400 --> 23:28.920
Yes, yes.

23:29.880 --> 23:35.280
SheHulk10 says, if the world is ever changing, then online single player is fun.

23:35.640 --> 23:39.320
You know, and when it comes to like Diablo 4, I don't mind it.

23:39.320 --> 23:44.560
I like the sense of like the world being alive and seeing other people and all of that stuff.

23:44.560 --> 23:50.760
So if there's kind of like a point that makes sense, I don't just hate it on its merits alone.

23:51.080 --> 24:04.440
But I also like it's kind of it's one of those weird things where like, as a gamer who plays and consumes a lot of games is like you kind of know when a game needs to be online to enhance it.

24:04.880 --> 24:14.560
And when the only reason it's having you online is for telemetry, quote unquote, so I'm using my quoting fingers to represent for the online shop is what I really mean.

24:14.560 --> 24:24.640
And I feel like a lot of our bullshit detectors are very strong and we can sense when a game doesn't really need to be online and how that can be very frustrating.

24:25.200 --> 24:36.360
So completely, by the way, agree with Fixie in chat in response to what E3vil said, I'm just going to say evil.

24:37.560 --> 24:40.040
Kids know how to fucking read a book, OK, dude?

24:41.040 --> 25:04.600
Kids, the letters on an e-reader are the same as the letters in a book, it's just a matter of convenience, that makes zero sense to me, I don't get I don't get why why you say that, OK, but how hard is it if I can turn a page, there's they know how to turn a page on a book.

25:04.840 --> 25:16.480
There's these there's these clickbaity articles out there that talk about I know where the school of thought comes from, and it's the clickbait social media culture is that there's that clickbaity article about that.

25:16.880 --> 25:22.040
The five year old is handed a book and they try to do this to the book and I'm doing a swiping motion with my finger.

25:22.040 --> 25:26.280
They try to do this to the book because they don't understand because they've never seen a physical book before.

25:26.440 --> 25:29.400
And these are clickbaity articles that are all over Facebook and social media.

25:29.400 --> 25:32.840
I see where that is coming from.

25:33.000 --> 25:33.520
I do.

25:33.960 --> 25:35.520
But it doesn't take.

25:35.520 --> 25:40.560
But also, yes, to your point and what Fixie saying, it takes 30 seconds to figure it out.

25:40.560 --> 25:47.160
But boy, oh boy, do the parents love to tell the entire neighborhood about that 30 seconds about their kid trying to swipe the book.

25:48.000 --> 25:51.120
Like they're bragging about their kid not being able to figure something out.

25:52.040 --> 25:52.960
That's what it is.

25:53.880 --> 26:06.040
I stopped trying to make kids look stupid or foolish or unable to figure out earlier technology or things like that.

26:06.040 --> 26:06.960
It's ridiculous.

26:06.960 --> 26:09.280
Kids are smarter than we give them credit for.

26:09.800 --> 26:12.400
You know, we were we were all there, too.

26:12.400 --> 26:14.840
We were smarter than we were given credit for.

26:15.320 --> 26:20.920
Let's just stop spreading this really toxic stereotype.

26:20.920 --> 26:25.640
You know, it's it's it's trying to do an us versus them thing.

26:25.640 --> 26:29.200
Every generation tries to do it and it should just be us.

26:29.760 --> 26:34.120
And we have responsibility to help them and they're going to be the next generation.

26:34.120 --> 26:34.800
It's just us.

26:35.120 --> 26:37.520
And that has been something.

26:37.520 --> 26:39.400
Unfortunately, I don't disagree with Shane at all.

26:39.680 --> 26:43.840
But unfortunately, this has been a thing that's been around for generations.

26:44.200 --> 26:47.680
You know, I think think back to TV shows from the 70s.

26:47.680 --> 26:49.440
Kids say the darndest things.

26:49.680 --> 26:55.600
And it's all about the wacky, wild things kids do.

26:57.120 --> 27:06.600
I mean, all right, so think back to like 1984 with a Mac in front of you, you know, you didn't know what to do with the computer the first time you saw one.

27:06.600 --> 27:08.880
It's like, is this is this a typewriter?

27:09.480 --> 27:15.880
Yeah, but you figured it out, you know, sitting down with your first video game console.

27:16.520 --> 27:18.680
You're not going to be instantly good at it.

27:18.680 --> 27:19.640
You got to figure it out.

27:19.640 --> 27:22.280
And the example with the kids with the rotary phone.

27:23.080 --> 27:26.160
I mean, they're not stupid.

27:26.160 --> 27:31.080
They can they figure it out eventually that, OK, you turn the thing to make the thing go.

27:31.600 --> 27:34.320
You know, they know what a receiver is, right?

27:34.320 --> 27:37.000
Because it you see it in a movie.

27:37.960 --> 27:43.120
No, it's obvious it is one has ear, one has mouth.

27:43.120 --> 27:44.080
It's like your headset.

27:45.080 --> 27:48.520
And even if you hold it backwards, it still kind of works.

27:48.520 --> 27:50.160
I know that from being a kid.

27:52.440 --> 27:59.360
All right, let's move on and talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing this week.

27:59.960 --> 28:01.200
And I will start with Dark Sakura.

28:03.360 --> 28:06.280
I have, of course, been playing Dead by Daylight.

28:06.640 --> 28:16.400
I, I, well, yeah, I played Marvel Midnight Suns last night because I got the wrong controller again.

28:16.960 --> 28:19.760
I mean, I have a use for it, so it's not that big of a deal.

28:19.760 --> 28:24.520
But I bought another controller to see if I can play Star Ocean next weekend.

28:25.720 --> 28:29.440
I did all of my testing with Osha Berry Proteus.

28:29.920 --> 28:34.680
So there has been some Proteus and Jackie Crush in my life also in the week.

28:37.000 --> 28:51.760
And then I played, of course, my stupid wordscapes, because I actually I'm getting to the point now where I'm solving this, the quote, super hard puzzles in 10 to 15 seconds.

28:51.760 --> 28:55.520
And and then sometimes my brain is just so like, what?

28:55.520 --> 28:56.520
What's this word?

28:57.520 --> 28:59.360
You know, so I'm going back and forth with it.

28:59.920 --> 29:09.920
And also playing more Beatlemania Pinball because it's fucking fun.

29:09.920 --> 29:13.040
We have a Dracula, but I've never liked that table.

29:15.120 --> 29:19.080
We, I played something else.

29:19.080 --> 29:22.720
And for the life of me, I cannot think of what the crap it was.

29:23.320 --> 29:27.720
Now, maybe I'm just thinking of Parodius and Jackie Crush for Super Famicom.

29:28.280 --> 29:34.680
But yeah, that's been I'm dipping back into some of my old school loves.

29:35.200 --> 29:42.840
And again, if if anyone doesn't know, Jackie Crush is the third in the Crush series of pinball games.

29:43.360 --> 29:46.240
So there's Alien Crush.

29:47.000 --> 29:49.600
What? Wait, why can't my brain think of the other Alien one?

29:49.600 --> 29:50.040
Devil.

29:50.680 --> 29:51.400
Devil's Crush.

29:51.640 --> 29:55.200
And then Jackie Crush brain farts.

29:55.880 --> 30:02.400
And I'm actually thinking about going back to playing Demon's Tilt just on like, you know, off nights.

30:02.960 --> 30:06.080
I really it's such a good spiritual successor.

30:06.080 --> 30:07.040
It's such a good game.

30:07.520 --> 30:17.800
Oh, and I've been sort of laughing to myself about the Dead Hard nerf and the the joke that Behavior made about nerfed the pig.

30:17.800 --> 30:21.320
And really, they just gave her an improved one of her perks.

30:22.320 --> 30:24.560
Because Behavior gets the memes.

30:26.200 --> 30:27.240
That was pretty funny.

30:28.560 --> 30:30.160
Oh, yeah, and the circle of healing nerf.

30:30.160 --> 30:31.080
There's that too.

30:31.080 --> 30:38.560
But that one I'm kind of I'm not like all up in arms about it because I was never a booner.

30:38.840 --> 30:43.720
The slower healing irritated about and I can get into that.

30:43.720 --> 30:54.560
I wish I'd put it into like my chosen story thing because they they put out a big developer update with a lot of changes that have people losing their shit on the Internet.

30:55.200 --> 30:56.840
Because they always lose their shit on the Internet.

30:59.360 --> 31:03.760
I'll be right back by continue on Loki when yeah, I'll tell you guys what's going on in a minute.

31:04.360 --> 31:05.040
Okay, okay.

31:05.240 --> 31:18.160
Well, I mean, just in a nutshell, the big ones that people are irritated about are the Dead Hard nerf, which means you have you now have to have unhook somebody to get the benefit from.

31:18.200 --> 31:18.680
I don't know.

31:18.680 --> 31:21.840
I hate Dead Hard and I've never used it on purpose except for like twice.

31:22.680 --> 31:26.200
And then the the circle of healing.

31:26.240 --> 31:29.960
Yeah, still it now requires that you have a medkit to be able to self care.

31:29.960 --> 31:30.920
I think that's ridiculous.

31:30.920 --> 31:37.160
And then slowing down the rate of of healing with a medkit is also ridiculous.

31:41.440 --> 31:42.320
Whatever behavior.

31:42.720 --> 31:43.080
All right.

31:43.080 --> 31:45.640
But anyway, Loki.

31:46.640 --> 31:57.840
I was just working on Minecraft stuff this week, mostly just finishing up a build and editing, still working on editing, hoping to have my new episode out here soon.

31:57.840 --> 32:09.640
The problem is every time I introduce a robot master in in the series, I have to hand animate the stage like intro thing that they do in like Mega Man 2 and it takes time.

32:10.840 --> 32:14.120
It's annoying, but I have to do it because perfection.

32:15.120 --> 32:18.800
So hopefully we'll have a new episode out, hopefully by tomorrow.

32:19.880 --> 32:20.360
Awesome.

32:20.360 --> 32:21.080
That's about it.

32:21.160 --> 32:21.480
Yeah.

32:21.720 --> 32:22.200
Good luck.

32:22.680 --> 32:23.080
Never did.

32:23.080 --> 32:26.520
Is it still no word on the Minecraft contest from a couple weeks ago?

32:26.760 --> 32:27.240
All right.

32:27.480 --> 32:28.080
I'm trying.

32:28.080 --> 32:28.400
I'm trying.

32:28.400 --> 32:28.840
I'm thinking.

32:28.840 --> 32:29.400
I'm thinking about it.

32:29.400 --> 32:29.760
All right.

32:31.040 --> 32:31.640
My gaming week.

32:31.640 --> 32:36.800
Actually, before I get to my gaming week, let me talk about something else real quick, because it has to do with what I just disappeared about.

32:36.800 --> 32:40.760
So, you know, and a lot of you know about, huh?

32:41.480 --> 32:42.440
I hope everything's okay.

32:42.840 --> 32:44.120
It's actually not about me.

32:44.120 --> 32:44.680
It's about Mr.

32:44.680 --> 32:45.160
Smoosh.

32:45.160 --> 32:48.320
And I think maybe you've caught about some of this from social media and stuff.

32:48.320 --> 32:50.960
Oh, maybe no, because I don't really post on Twitter as much as I used to.

32:51.360 --> 32:52.200
So here's the thing.

32:52.200 --> 32:52.840
Here's what's going on.

32:52.840 --> 32:53.400
So Mr.

32:53.400 --> 33:03.920
Smoosh gave us a little bit of a scare on Wednesday, and we ended up spending like seven hours at the emergency vet because he was very lethargic, not wanting to move.

33:03.920 --> 33:08.680
We could tell he wasn't really wanting to move his back legs like something was kind of going on there.

33:09.640 --> 33:14.480
And so we thought he may have had a seizure or something like may have happened.

33:14.760 --> 33:23.080
So we took him in and they ruled out that he can still use his back legs because they were warm.

33:23.080 --> 33:23.840
They weren't cold.

33:24.120 --> 33:34.720
And we ended up going to the ER vet and we spent a lot of money, but well, we didn't spend two because we could have gotten an MRI for $7,000, but I have to draw the line somewhere.

33:35.520 --> 33:48.520
So they did some x-rays and we kind of found out the next day that the x-rays were showing that he probably has a calcified disc in his back, which doesn't happen in cats as often as it doesn't dogs.

33:48.520 --> 33:51.280
That's usually a thing for dogs, but they say it can happen in cats.

33:51.520 --> 33:52.040
You know, Mr.

33:52.040 --> 34:01.760
Smoosh is a special cat, but it kind of explains like, oh, this is why when we found him, he was on the stairs, but at the halfway point.

34:02.000 --> 34:07.760
And like he didn't want to continue the journey up or down the stairs, whichever way he was going, he was kind of hiding behind the scratching post there.

34:08.160 --> 34:14.200
So we've kind of noticed since then, now that we're starting to get some answers, we've kind of noticed that he does have an aversion to stairs.

34:14.640 --> 34:18.000
He'll use them if he's motivated by food.

34:18.560 --> 34:20.480
He'll still try to go down, even though he shouldn't be.

34:20.480 --> 34:23.920
So we have a baby gate on the way from Amazon to try to stave that off.

34:25.240 --> 34:31.040
But he'll try to use the stairs still if he's food motivated, but otherwise he's kind of not using it.

34:31.080 --> 34:34.160
So we moved all there for those that know the layout of my house.

34:34.160 --> 34:35.960
We moved all the cat food upstairs.

34:36.120 --> 34:38.160
So the cats have everything they need upstairs.

34:38.440 --> 34:42.920
He shouldn't have a need to go downstairs, but he just kind of does it for whatever.

34:42.920 --> 34:44.600
You can't tell a cat no, right?

34:44.600 --> 34:45.680
Like or stop that.

34:45.680 --> 34:46.520
You'll hurt yourself.

34:46.840 --> 34:54.280
So, yeah, at the end of the day, you know, the reality is he's an extremely inbred cat.

34:54.280 --> 34:57.200
He was a rescue and he was a very special kind of rescue.

34:57.200 --> 34:58.560
He has cool David Bowie eyes, too.

34:58.880 --> 34:59.480
He does.

34:59.520 --> 35:06.080
That's why the thought was originally it could have been neurological because the eyes are a sign that he's always had something kind of up neurologically.

35:06.400 --> 35:10.480
But the X-ray kind of makes us think and especially his behaviors.

35:10.480 --> 35:12.560
It's like, oh, he has an aversion to stairs.

35:12.560 --> 35:15.400
OK, yeah, he doesn't really want to use his back or whatever.

35:15.760 --> 35:17.920
But the reality is he's he's old.

35:17.920 --> 35:22.040
He's like a 10 year old cat at this point, which for his breed is getting pretty old.

35:22.400 --> 35:24.480
So, you know, it was scary.

35:24.480 --> 35:26.720
We thought that.

35:27.120 --> 35:31.120
Yeah, you got smooshy kind of around the time I got Midna.

35:31.240 --> 35:32.680
Well, it was the same year my mom passed.

35:32.680 --> 35:33.600
It was twenty seventeen.

35:33.680 --> 35:36.560
So and he was already three or four base.

35:36.560 --> 35:38.040
And that's based on the vet's estimate.

35:38.040 --> 35:39.080
For all we know, it could be older.

35:39.840 --> 35:43.280
Yeah, it wasn't too long after I'd gotten Midna and it was just a few years.

35:43.280 --> 35:46.560
So it is turning 11 on my birthday next month.

35:46.600 --> 35:48.240
Yeah, so yeah.

35:48.480 --> 35:51.120
So anyway, not to not to bring and thank you.

35:51.120 --> 35:53.960
I see you all in chat sending the love and thank you.

35:53.960 --> 35:56.080
It's it's received and thank you very much for that.

35:56.120 --> 35:58.360
And I just know, you know, you all know the cat, Mr.

35:58.360 --> 35:58.920
Smoosh and all that.

35:58.920 --> 36:00.760
But that's just something we've been kind of dealing with.

36:00.760 --> 36:05.200
And that's why I just went off screen here, because I can see from where I'm at.

36:05.200 --> 36:09.280
I have a view of the staircase and I could see him kind of going meow meow and kind of pacing around.

36:09.280 --> 36:11.280
I thought, oh, is he wanting to go downstairs?

36:11.600 --> 36:14.360
But Alan thinks he's just hungry because it's about that time.

36:14.360 --> 36:19.960
So he's he's just out there complaining about food to anyone that I've had a hard time.

36:19.960 --> 36:20.920
Give me extra food.

36:20.920 --> 36:23.760
Yeah, pretty much. But he's getting spoiled now.

36:23.760 --> 36:29.240
Not only did his dad spend again, I a lot of money on that.

36:29.400 --> 36:32.200
I we have a he had expenses.

36:32.280 --> 36:37.440
Yeah. And I'm sure I'm sure many folks out there know, you know, it's just one of those things that it's never.

36:37.600 --> 36:40.920
And, you know, you're you're you're a captive in that moment.

36:40.920 --> 36:45.000
You will do whatever it takes to help your little furry friends.

36:45.000 --> 36:47.280
So it's it's rough.

36:47.640 --> 36:51.080
I've already decided that with my next cat, I'm getting insurance.

36:51.120 --> 36:52.320
Yeah. Yeah.

36:53.000 --> 36:56.440
It's probably something I can't I can't afford to get Midna's teeth fixed.

36:56.600 --> 37:01.760
Yeah. So I just have to brush her teeth and give her antibiotic,

37:01.760 --> 37:04.840
you know, stuff for her water and hope for the best.

37:06.120 --> 37:09.880
So and it was interesting watching Cheddar kind of respond to the whole thing, too,

37:09.880 --> 37:12.520
because he was kind of like, what the hell's going on?

37:12.520 --> 37:16.480
And then he was he was really staying away from all of us when we got back.

37:16.480 --> 37:19.520
He would not. And we were like, what's and they were like, oh, because we smell like the vet

37:20.360 --> 37:22.200
and all those other animals that were there.

37:22.200 --> 37:25.040
So it took him it took him about a day for him to warm back up to us.

37:25.040 --> 37:26.880
So this is very interesting.

37:26.880 --> 37:31.520
Anyway, sorry not to divert too much, but that's what's going on.

37:31.520 --> 37:36.320
So I think now that I think about it, Alan wrote a couple of tweets,

37:36.320 --> 37:39.160
but I understand a tweet can get lost amongst all the other stuff.

37:39.160 --> 37:43.160
And yeah, it's just hard to update everybody work the last four days.

37:43.160 --> 37:46.640
So it's hard for me to to check, except in this little crazy burst.

37:46.640 --> 37:49.160
For sure. For sure. Yeah.

37:49.160 --> 37:55.480
Anyways, I just going to say Midna has been extra all upon, but.

37:55.480 --> 37:59.360
Yeah, she just has allergies. Yeah. Yeah.

37:59.360 --> 38:04.440
So when I did play games this week, when I wasn't too taken over by that,

38:04.440 --> 38:08.280
I've played a little bit of the Diablo four beta this weekend, although granted,

38:08.280 --> 38:13.440
not nearly as much as I was playing last weekend because I finally got that point.

38:13.440 --> 38:17.560
As much as I love Diablo four, I've kind of got to that point where I'm like, OK,

38:17.640 --> 38:19.760
well, they're going to erase these characters anyway.

38:19.760 --> 38:23.000
I've hit twenty five, which is the max level in the beta.

38:23.000 --> 38:27.200
And not not only will I have my pet dog thing that you get at twenty,

38:27.200 --> 38:32.000
but I can I entered myself into the contest to get painted into the chapel in France,

38:32.000 --> 38:37.240
whatever they're doing, if you actually get to twenty five, because that'll be fun.

38:37.240 --> 38:39.800
Can you imagine my face in a chapel somewhere?

38:39.800 --> 38:44.480
I hope I win. I've never wanted to win a contest more in my life.

38:44.480 --> 38:47.160
So I did everything I could do with that.

38:47.160 --> 38:49.440
And so I'm kind of at the point where I'm like, OK, well,

38:49.440 --> 38:51.000
I screwed around with some of the new classes.

38:51.000 --> 38:53.840
But the reality is, let's just wait for the game to come out at this point.

38:53.840 --> 38:55.320
I'm happy to stress test.

38:55.320 --> 38:57.440
So I did that a little bit this weekend. I played.

38:57.440 --> 39:01.520
I sat in the queue for a little bit, but I didn't I didn't need to hit the pavement

39:01.520 --> 39:05.800
as hard as I was doing last week and ensuring that I hit the the max level I could.

39:05.800 --> 39:07.680
But I'm still loving Diablo four.

39:07.680 --> 39:10.280
Absolutely. I'm buying it when it comes out.

39:10.280 --> 39:14.760
Can't wait. Other games I've been playing a little bit of theater,

39:14.920 --> 39:15.680
but not a lot.

39:15.680 --> 39:17.560
I think I did stream that a little bit this week

39:17.560 --> 39:21.080
because I finished No Man's Sky Expedition nine on Monday.

39:21.320 --> 39:23.360
It only took me about another forty five minutes on stream

39:23.360 --> 39:25.120
and I finished the expedition and got the rewards.

39:25.120 --> 39:26.720
So, yeah, that was an accomplishment.

39:26.720 --> 39:29.000
I beat something that was an accomplishment.

39:29.200 --> 39:31.920
And then I played more theater than which I still have not played

39:31.920 --> 39:33.720
every song one time yet.

39:33.720 --> 39:36.760
There's still like at least probably 50 more songs going to make my way through.

39:36.760 --> 39:39.160
But there's just so many songs in that game.

39:39.160 --> 39:43.480
So honestly, between all those things, that's pretty much my gaming week.

39:43.640 --> 39:46.880
So we'll move on.

39:46.880 --> 39:49.200
Let's get into some other headlines.

39:49.720 --> 39:53.120
I was trying to think if there's any like housekeeping or programming notes,

39:53.120 --> 39:54.400
but not really.

39:54.400 --> 40:00.640
We don't have any plan trips or anything that'll get take the show away coming up.

40:00.640 --> 40:03.280
So we'll be here for the next few weeks,

40:04.320 --> 40:05.840
as long as we have power and all that good stuff.

40:05.840 --> 40:08.240
All right, Loki, let's get into some news.

40:09.040 --> 40:10.960
Yes, this is a very exciting out of nowhere.

40:11.000 --> 40:16.400
There is the announcement that Valve is putting out Counter-Strike 2,

40:16.680 --> 40:19.720
which is going to be a free update for Counter-Strike Go,

40:19.720 --> 40:22.440
which will completely redo the whole game.

40:24.120 --> 40:27.480
So they had some trailers that they put out kind of talk about

40:27.480 --> 40:31.440
the different game mechanics that they're adding to it.

40:31.720 --> 40:35.960
So, for example, they have volumetric smoke grenades now, which look really cool.

40:35.960 --> 40:38.320
They kind of react to

40:38.320 --> 40:41.520
bullet shots and also other explosions nearby.

40:42.080 --> 40:44.840
They're going to have something that's like a sub tick.

40:44.840 --> 40:47.320
So it basically allows for more accurate

40:47.600 --> 40:51.120
positioning of players and bullets and that type of stuff.

40:51.360 --> 40:56.160
They're overhauling the maps as well as keeping some of the older maps as well.

40:56.160 --> 40:59.560
Kind of like the kind of doing it in three different phases.

40:59.560 --> 41:03.600
So they have the older maps that they're kind of giving new

41:03.600 --> 41:05.800
like lighting effects to and that type of stuff.

41:05.800 --> 41:08.000
But essentially, there could be exactly the same.

41:08.520 --> 41:10.120
Then there's

41:10.960 --> 41:14.520
some updated maps that they're adding, you know, like more features to

41:14.520 --> 41:18.280
that kind of utilize more of Counter-Strike 2

41:18.280 --> 41:20.760
and then like some fully redone maps.

41:21.800 --> 41:24.240
Higher resolution models for the guns.

41:24.240 --> 41:27.000
New Source 2 tools for modders.

41:28.000 --> 41:29.840
New blood splatters.

41:29.840 --> 41:35.720
And see, they said completely re-authored explosions and more accurate audio.

41:36.160 --> 41:37.760
It looks pretty sweet.

41:37.760 --> 41:40.080
Bigger and badder explosions.

41:40.560 --> 41:44.000
Exactly. The smoke, the smoke looks cool, too.

41:44.000 --> 41:46.120
Like, I think that's kind of the fun stuff.

41:46.680 --> 41:49.880
They're saying that all existing Counter-Strike Go skins will transfer

41:49.880 --> 41:54.920
to Counter-Strike 2 and they'll be also more visually detailed.

41:55.240 --> 41:56.240
So that's kind of cool.

41:56.240 --> 41:58.120
You know, they get all that stuff to go along with it.

41:59.240 --> 42:01.280
Yeah. Excited to see what else they do with that.

42:01.640 --> 42:04.800
Talk about, you know, last week how gamers are eating good.

42:04.800 --> 42:07.960
Well, it's putting more food out.

42:08.000 --> 42:12.040
Well, you know, with Counter-Strike, this kind of upgrade,

42:12.040 --> 42:15.600
this is a little bit like, you know, Counter-Strike to Counter-Strike 2

42:15.600 --> 42:17.600
or I guess really Counter-Strike Go to Counter-Strike 2

42:17.840 --> 42:20.880
is kind of like Overwatch to Overwatch 2, right?

42:20.880 --> 42:23.760
Like this is meant to replace the base game, right?

42:23.760 --> 42:24.760
Well, except more.

42:24.760 --> 42:27.760
Like they didn't really do as much into Overwatch 2

42:27.760 --> 42:30.400
comparisonally, but it is meant to be a replacement.

42:30.400 --> 42:31.720
Overwatch 2 is essentially Overwatch 1.

42:31.760 --> 42:35.120
But yeah, yeah, basically it is an overhaul to the original game.

42:35.240 --> 42:37.120
OK. And it's meant to replace it.

42:37.120 --> 42:40.000
And it is it's it's I think I heard it's going to be free to those

42:40.000 --> 42:42.480
that already have Counter-Strike, basically, which I mean,

42:42.760 --> 42:46.240
how many people haven't picked up Counter-Strike in some kind of bundle

42:46.240 --> 42:49.680
over the years or some kind of sale on Valve?

42:49.680 --> 42:51.760
Like that game's been out a long time.

42:51.760 --> 42:53.960
You probably have it in your library and you don't even know it.

42:53.960 --> 42:56.320
You know, like it's you got it somewhere.

42:56.600 --> 42:57.760
So that's interesting.

42:57.760 --> 42:59.960
That'll be coming out, you know, the sequel.

43:00.800 --> 43:05.000
It's also nice that Valve is finally putting out a game that isn't VR

43:05.840 --> 43:08.280
for for the rest of us that, you know, aren't quite on board

43:08.280 --> 43:10.280
with the VR stuff still.

43:10.280 --> 43:11.520
And it's it's nice.

43:11.520 --> 43:15.240
Granted, I haven't played Counter-Strike since the original Xbox.

43:15.240 --> 43:18.440
I'm not even talking about the original Xbox last time I played Counter-Strike.

43:18.440 --> 43:21.720
But still, it is nice that they still avoided using three.

43:21.720 --> 43:24.560
Technically, since this is like the third Counter-Strike game,

43:24.560 --> 43:25.880
but it is Counter-Strike 2.

43:25.880 --> 43:29.760
So still no threes in Valve's life.

43:30.120 --> 43:33.120
They don't have to break their habit there.

43:34.040 --> 43:36.080
Yeah. Let's see.

43:36.080 --> 43:40.440
E3VL does point out at least they didn't go the free to play model like Overwatch.

43:40.920 --> 43:42.440
So that is that is also it.

43:42.440 --> 43:47.360
Well, do we do we know of any types of microtransactions,

43:47.360 --> 43:50.040
battle passes, things they might be looking to add

43:50.360 --> 43:53.000
since they are essentially giving this away for free?

43:53.520 --> 43:55.360
Well, I don't think it's anything different than what they have now.

43:55.400 --> 43:56.640
Was it the gun skins?

43:56.640 --> 43:58.040
Don't they have all that stuff?

43:58.040 --> 43:59.560
Like, isn't that a whole thing?

43:59.760 --> 44:03.120
Don't they have crates and stuff?

44:03.160 --> 44:04.560
Yeah, I guess that's true.

44:04.560 --> 44:07.120
Gambling stuff. True, true.

44:07.120 --> 44:08.800
I assume that's still a thing.

44:08.800 --> 44:12.560
And Chad is debating if this is actually fourth or fifth Counter-Strike.

44:12.920 --> 44:17.040
Mike Def says OG Counter-Strike, Source, Go, and now two.

44:17.760 --> 44:20.800
E3VL is counting one called Condition Zero as well.

44:20.800 --> 44:23.640
So there's been a few Counter-Strike games.

44:24.200 --> 44:25.360
None of them number three, though.

44:25.360 --> 44:26.720
No, none of them three. No.

44:29.920 --> 44:33.480
All right. Moving on, let's talk about this, which, by the way,

44:33.480 --> 44:36.040
also kind of plays into the whole like reminders

44:36.040 --> 44:37.600
that we're going to be talking about Nintendo.

44:37.600 --> 44:40.360
I think we have an email on it later, so I won't go too far in depth.

44:40.360 --> 44:43.440
But, you know, we talked about it already last week, really.

44:43.440 --> 44:47.520
But the Nintendo eShop is basically going to be closing

44:47.520 --> 44:50.520
at some point very soon tomorrow.

44:50.520 --> 44:52.520
But we don't know when. Is that 1201?

44:52.800 --> 44:54.760
Is that 1159?

44:54.760 --> 44:55.960
We don't know when tomorrow.

44:55.960 --> 44:58.600
But, you know, we're in the last dawn of the final day,

44:58.600 --> 45:01.160
basically, of the Wii U and 3DS eShops.

45:02.200 --> 45:04.840
So I know we have an email on it later.

45:04.840 --> 45:05.800
I'll wait till we get to that.

45:05.800 --> 45:09.960
But, you know, it has a lot of us kind of either making those last few purchases or.

45:11.360 --> 45:13.560
For me, I'm kind of like,

45:13.560 --> 45:16.000
why would I reward Nintendo for this right now?

45:16.000 --> 45:16.560
I'm not going to.

45:16.560 --> 45:19.120
But I don't want to tell people what they should and shouldn't do.

45:19.120 --> 45:21.160
I understand why people want to do their last minute shopping,

45:21.160 --> 45:22.560
get those things where they go away.

45:22.560 --> 45:25.040
I'm kind of like, I don't want to reward Nintendo for this decision.

45:25.040 --> 45:27.120
Like I bought what I bought and that's it.

45:27.680 --> 45:32.960
But here's a concept I do want to reward because I think this sounds great.

45:33.200 --> 45:37.360
And this is a retro game project coming out for the Switch.

45:37.640 --> 45:39.760
It's called Project Egg.

45:40.480 --> 45:42.440
This is still a tentative title.

45:42.440 --> 45:44.680
It is from D4 Enterprise,

45:44.920 --> 45:47.760
and it's something that they're going to be using to release titles

45:47.760 --> 45:50.720
from their retro games distribution service for the Switch.

45:51.040 --> 45:54.320
And these are going to be games for platforms like MSX,

45:54.640 --> 45:57.760
PC-9801, PC-8801.

45:58.920 --> 46:03.040
This is also a platform that's going to be used Pico Pico for smartphones.

46:03.040 --> 46:08.240
And they say virtual console for Wii U, Wii and 3DS, but I don't.

46:09.480 --> 46:13.320
I think this is because I think they're talking about that

46:13.320 --> 46:16.720
they have released games prior on these systems.

46:17.000 --> 46:18.680
So if you want to go back and look at those systems,

46:18.680 --> 46:20.120
kind of see like what is that?

46:20.120 --> 46:23.120
Sorry, that's just a very oddly worded phrase there.

46:23.120 --> 46:26.240
But if you want to see the types of games they have released,

46:26.240 --> 46:28.480
they're in those archives.

46:29.120 --> 46:34.040
Egg, if you are curious, stands for engrossing game gallery,

46:34.880 --> 46:37.200
which of course is leading to all of those memes of

46:37.360 --> 46:40.000
can I offer you an egg in these trying times?

46:40.640 --> 46:43.120
Some of the games I recognize just from the screenshots,

46:43.120 --> 46:45.160
I notice Hyde Lied in there.

46:46.320 --> 46:49.920
So yeah, this sounds like it's the what I like about it is

46:49.920 --> 46:51.960
these are I hope this comes out for the US.

46:52.120 --> 46:54.160
It does look very Japanese based.

46:54.160 --> 46:55.880
But of course, the Switch is reason free.

46:56.840 --> 47:00.200
I hope that there's some really good stuff in there.

47:00.760 --> 47:03.240
Like I like the obscure type of stuff.

47:03.240 --> 47:04.880
Oh, one of the Cotton Games is in here.

47:04.880 --> 47:06.480
I see in the screenshot, actually.

47:06.480 --> 47:08.400
I know Jamie loves that series.

47:08.400 --> 47:11.160
Revival Xanadu is also called out by name there.

47:11.160 --> 47:15.240
So there's just a lot of like obscure but cool titles in here.

47:15.480 --> 47:18.240
And that's exactly the types of stuff we should be celebrating

47:18.360 --> 47:19.840
in these retro catalogs.

47:19.840 --> 47:21.400
So I think this is neat.

47:21.400 --> 47:24.840
So props to D4 for working on this and making it happen.

47:25.120 --> 47:28.120
So there was a thing it said in there, too, like

47:29.120 --> 47:31.800
I noticed like when I translated the what,

47:32.080 --> 47:35.840
you know, talking about Project A, it says general creators.

47:35.840 --> 47:36.880
It was built.

47:36.880 --> 47:40.320
People will be able to sell software created for retro consoles.

47:40.320 --> 47:44.720
I guess homebrew software like their PC 8801, PC 9801,

47:45.000 --> 47:49.160
X68000, FM7, X1, MSX, et cetera.

47:49.960 --> 47:50.760
Holy moly.

47:50.760 --> 47:53.800
So looking at this list over on because

47:54.880 --> 47:59.480
I guess on Wiki there's actually a big old list there in the D4 Enterprise article.

47:59.680 --> 48:02.520
I did not realize it was this large of a library.

48:02.520 --> 48:03.360
Oops, sorry, folks.

48:03.360 --> 48:08.040
I just accidentally placed this over the webcam capture.

48:08.040 --> 48:09.240
But look at this.

48:09.240 --> 48:12.400
Like there are one thousand eighty four games on this list.

48:12.400 --> 48:15.200
I have no idea how to even organize a list like this,

48:15.560 --> 48:19.000
but it does have things for the arcade, including Double Dragon is in there.

48:19.760 --> 48:21.880
A lot of Famicom based games.

48:22.520 --> 48:23.680
Yeah, Karnov.

48:23.680 --> 48:26.000
So you get an idea of the types of like developers

48:26.000 --> 48:27.320
that they're working with and so forth.

48:27.320 --> 48:30.800
So this is going to be a very beefy collection

48:30.800 --> 48:32.160
whenever it comes out for Switch.

48:32.160 --> 48:33.680
So that's really cool.

48:33.680 --> 48:35.200
So oops.

48:35.720 --> 48:37.400
Not that sorry.

48:37.400 --> 48:41.760
Having to produce, do camera angles and all that on the fly is hard sometimes.

48:41.760 --> 48:44.680
So sorry for the awkwardness on twitch shots sometimes.

48:45.520 --> 48:46.360
All right.

48:47.080 --> 48:48.240
Dark to see also points out

48:48.240 --> 48:51.480
if you want to see a YouTube channel that has short video clips of these games

48:51.680 --> 48:54.120
that is also available with Project Egg.

48:55.120 --> 48:55.480
All right.

48:55.480 --> 48:59.240
Let's move on to some not so great news.

48:59.240 --> 49:02.800
But unfortunately, one we're hearing a lot in this industry lately, Dark Sakura.

49:04.200 --> 49:06.360
Well, and it's full of a lot of just like.

49:08.280 --> 49:10.800
Excuse talk to me.

49:10.800 --> 49:12.480
But at any rate.

49:13.160 --> 49:15.360
More than 400 Twitch employees

49:15.600 --> 49:18.200
got laid off because of what Amazon's going through.

49:19.160 --> 49:22.240
Amazon announced another 9000 job cuts,

49:23.040 --> 49:26.000
adding to the 18000 layoffs from January.

49:27.000 --> 49:30.360
And then about 400 employees from Twitch

49:30.360 --> 49:34.120
are affected in that that whole business.

49:36.000 --> 49:40.600
Twitch didn't give the impacted employees

49:40.600 --> 49:43.720
any sort of advance notice ahead of the announcement on the 20th.

49:46.000 --> 49:49.080
The CEO just basically sent out an all staff email

49:49.280 --> 49:52.840
that people affected would be informed no later than early next week.

49:55.360 --> 49:57.520
And it's just, again, just a bunch of.

49:58.640 --> 50:00.640
Excuse talk.

50:00.640 --> 50:05.120
The CEO, Clancy, is blaming the layoffs on, quote,

50:05.760 --> 50:09.680
current macro economic environment and user and revenue growth

50:09.680 --> 50:12.600
that has not kept pace with our expectations, end quote.

50:13.080 --> 50:15.320
In other words, I'm going to throw out a bunch of jargon on there

50:15.320 --> 50:17.520
and hope that it sounds important enough for you to believe it.

50:19.600 --> 50:21.320
In a nutshell,

50:21.320 --> 50:23.240
they're not making the money we thought they did.

50:23.240 --> 50:26.320
So now we fucked up and now we have to fuck up these people's lives.

50:26.360 --> 50:28.680
Well, and who who misforecast that?

50:28.680 --> 50:31.600
I mean, I understand Twitch grew a lot during the pandemic.

50:31.600 --> 50:34.840
And so there's a little bit of like the tide receding a little bit as,

50:34.840 --> 50:37.440
you know, things, pandemic lockdowns

50:37.440 --> 50:39.840
practically ended pretty much across the globe at this point.

50:40.240 --> 50:42.480
That a lot of that is receding a little bit.

50:42.480 --> 50:45.440
But you would think that somebody could have seen that coming.

50:45.680 --> 50:47.960
It's weird. But at least there's this.

50:47.960 --> 50:49.960
This is this is interesting to me when I heard this.

50:49.960 --> 50:51.200
This is the interesting news.

50:51.200 --> 50:55.160
Emmett Shearer, the former CEO, just left last week.

50:55.480 --> 50:59.600
So I can't sit here and be like, well, why does nothing ever happen to the CEO?

50:59.600 --> 51:05.440
Well, OK. I mean, now, do we think that the CEO left because they,

51:05.480 --> 51:08.160
you know, did Emmett Shearer leave because this news was coming?

51:08.160 --> 51:10.160
I mean, in a variety of ways, probably yes.

51:10.160 --> 51:12.960
He probably left when he did. So he didn't have to do this.

51:13.360 --> 51:15.320
It's probably one of those things that was brought down.

51:15.320 --> 51:17.280
And so he kind of ran off into the night.

51:17.280 --> 51:18.880
But at least I can't sit here and go,

51:18.880 --> 51:21.720
why isn't the guy who's been CEO for the last few years been held accountable?

51:22.000 --> 51:25.120
He did bow out. I will get I will give him that credit.

51:26.440 --> 51:32.240
That that there's lots of CEOs in this industry who don't do that.

51:32.480 --> 51:34.840
So I'll give him that for what it's worth.

51:36.440 --> 51:39.840
But it is, yeah, it's garbage and it's.

51:41.040 --> 51:44.200
Instead of investing in their employees

51:44.200 --> 51:49.480
and pushing the company to do better or are finding other ways to

51:50.480 --> 51:54.960
use that talent pool, they're just saying, oh, no, we just don't want to pay you. Bye.

51:57.000 --> 51:57.520
I hate it.

51:58.680 --> 52:02.240
Maybe if there was more synergy with the rest of Amazon going on,

52:02.240 --> 52:04.080
because that's the other thing that blows my mind about Twitch

52:04.120 --> 52:08.440
sometimes is that like I feel like they live in a bubble with that so much.

52:08.440 --> 52:10.720
I know I've talked about this on the show and I'm sorry to repeat myself,

52:10.960 --> 52:14.760
but that so much of Amazon feels so siloed and that that I'm

52:15.240 --> 52:19.960
quite frankly shocked that Luna isn't more integrated into Twitch.

52:19.960 --> 52:22.360
Not that I'm saying I want that. I'm just shocked.

52:22.360 --> 52:26.120
They haven't taken more of an opportunity to do that. It's wild to me.

52:27.200 --> 52:29.880
Yeah, they they are really.

52:29.880 --> 52:34.160
They're just fucking the whole thing up.

52:34.160 --> 52:38.560
I mean, they acquire a platform that they don't truly understand,

52:38.560 --> 52:42.320
you know, to service people who do things that I think they don't truly understand.

52:42.840 --> 52:46.560
And then I just don't think that they know what they're doing.

52:46.880 --> 52:47.760
I mean, be honest.

52:47.760 --> 52:52.480
It should it should be this easy as like if Dark Sakura is going, hey,

52:53.320 --> 52:55.560
we need one more for our Swift and Dead by Daylight

52:55.560 --> 52:58.200
because somebody could make it tonight. Let's do one more for Swift.

52:58.400 --> 53:02.520
You should be able to click a button and fire up Dead by Daylight on Luna

53:02.520 --> 53:04.680
and be able to join her Swift right away.

53:04.680 --> 53:06.480
By the way, that was a thing in Stadia.

53:06.480 --> 53:08.760
But it's not there on it's not on.

53:08.760 --> 53:10.000
Oh, Dead by Daylight is not on Luna?

53:10.000 --> 53:12.640
OK, bad example. I just assume they put that game everywhere. My bad.

53:12.840 --> 53:16.280
OK, but but that example, that example,

53:16.280 --> 53:19.840
but a game that is on Luna still should should hold some water here.

53:20.120 --> 53:22.680
So I mean, it doesn't really matter the streaming service.

53:22.680 --> 53:25.080
If there's a streaming service that's owned by a company

53:25.520 --> 53:29.280
that also has live streaming service, you know, like a game

53:29.280 --> 53:32.680
streaming service with a company that owns their own streaming service.

53:33.680 --> 53:37.040
Like how the Google integration when Stadia was around,

53:37.560 --> 53:41.600
you pressed a button and it would link up to a live play on your YouTube channel.

53:41.600 --> 53:45.760
Yeah. Yeah, it's it's ridiculous.

53:45.760 --> 53:50.160
I mean, Stadia did it right and they got fucked over

53:50.600 --> 53:54.440
because Google's got this other weird announcement now

53:54.440 --> 53:56.960
about another company that they're working with for cloud based gaming.

53:56.960 --> 53:58.200
And I'm just like, I hate you.

53:58.200 --> 54:00.280
I officially hate you right now.

54:00.280 --> 54:02.360
Don't don't talk to me. Don't speak.

54:03.160 --> 54:04.720
I don't hear. Yeah, exactly.

54:04.720 --> 54:07.600
Exactly. Talk to the hand because the wallet doesn't want it.

54:08.600 --> 54:11.160
Exactly. But but like.

54:12.360 --> 54:19.320
I'm just. Maybe it's that I don't have that corporate mindset.

54:19.320 --> 54:22.520
I mean, I don't want to be a manager and I don't want to be corporate, you know,

54:23.360 --> 54:27.400
but at the same time, you know, I work for a company

54:27.400 --> 54:32.600
that is all about utilizing its talent pool instead of laying people off.

54:33.520 --> 54:36.280
You know, we have positions open in our company

54:36.280 --> 54:39.320
and they're hiring from other groups in the same company

54:39.680 --> 54:42.720
to cover those things instead of laying people off.

54:43.200 --> 54:44.960
And I can't say where I work.

54:44.960 --> 54:46.800
Some of you all know, don't say anything.

54:47.480 --> 54:54.400
But I think that that Amazon and a lot of these gaming companies

54:54.400 --> 54:57.480
that are laying off all these people need to actually really take a look

54:57.480 --> 55:00.600
at their business model and see why they're getting themselves

55:00.600 --> 55:02.920
into this puddle to begin with.

55:02.920 --> 55:07.760
You know, you can't keep doing things the same way

55:07.760 --> 55:12.000
they've always been done and get yourself into this pattern of fuckery.

55:12.880 --> 55:15.880
You know, the the quote is the definition of madness

55:15.880 --> 55:18.520
is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results.

55:19.000 --> 55:20.360
That's exactly what you're doing.

55:20.360 --> 55:23.960
You're hamsters in a wheel and the wheel keeps spinning and spinning.

55:24.680 --> 55:26.640
You need to do something different.

55:26.640 --> 55:29.120
You need to take a risk and do something fucking different.

55:30.440 --> 55:31.800
I want to get the comments from chat.

55:31.800 --> 55:33.040
There's a lot of good stuff in chat right now.

55:33.040 --> 55:36.160
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says there's also political infighting

55:36.160 --> 55:37.400
inside these large companies.

55:37.400 --> 55:39.520
Different divisions don't necessarily like each other

55:39.520 --> 55:41.480
and will not work to help everyone else.

55:41.480 --> 55:44.720
So the Luna and Twitch teams might not be on good terms with each other

55:44.720 --> 55:46.920
and are actively avoiding having to work together.

55:47.480 --> 55:48.400
Oh, my God.

55:48.400 --> 55:51.760
Then that if that if that I mean, I know that's hypothesizing,

55:52.040 --> 55:55.600
but if that was a thing, then that falls on Jeff Bezos

55:55.600 --> 55:59.960
to walk in there and say, you fucking make it work, period.

56:00.680 --> 56:03.080
And the head of Luna and the head of Twitch,

56:03.080 --> 56:06.520
your asses are on the line to make this work like it.

56:07.640 --> 56:08.480
This is wild.

56:08.480 --> 56:12.200
I mean, I'm not disputing what you're saying, Bobby,

56:12.600 --> 56:14.480
but it's it's it's wild to me

56:14.480 --> 56:17.280
that that can happen in a profitable company.

56:18.160 --> 56:19.400
If your job.

56:19.400 --> 56:22.000
I'm sorry, I forgot Jeff Bezos was retired, but you know, you know what I mean.

56:23.320 --> 56:26.240
If your job is to do

56:26.680 --> 56:30.040
what is necessary as dictated by your upper management

56:30.360 --> 56:33.640
to make something work, it does not matter

56:33.640 --> 56:35.920
how you feel about working with another department.

56:37.000 --> 56:38.280
End of story.

56:38.280 --> 56:40.600
Your assignment is to work together.

56:41.160 --> 56:44.160
So if they're not working together, this is coming from higher up than they are.

56:46.280 --> 56:49.440
Fixation Gaze says it feels like Amazon is using Twitch

56:49.440 --> 56:52.600
as a passive income and get upset when record profits

56:52.600 --> 56:55.160
manipulating a sick market aren't beaten.

56:55.840 --> 56:57.680
Absolutely. Absolutely.

56:57.680 --> 57:01.880
This is just supposed to be Amazon's little money printing thing,

57:01.880 --> 57:04.280
and they're not thinking about how they can better integrate it

57:04.280 --> 57:07.800
into the rest of their business and make it more profitable from that standpoint.

57:07.800 --> 57:09.240
It's very silly.

57:10.880 --> 57:14.880
Phil of nine says, I always wonder about how huge these tech companies got.

57:15.080 --> 57:17.440
It always seemed like they ballooned so quickly.

57:18.520 --> 57:21.720
2003 called and says

57:22.600 --> 57:25.040
history repeats itself.

57:27.200 --> 57:30.600
But yes, I mean, but that's exactly what I was saying about that pattern

57:30.600 --> 57:33.480
that no one seems to learn from, you know?

57:34.400 --> 57:37.480
And honestly, you know, what took down the Roman Empire,

57:37.920 --> 57:40.000
the fucking Roman Empire?

57:40.240 --> 57:41.400
That's going to happen again.

57:41.400 --> 57:44.520
The companies are going to get too big, too big, too big and explode.

57:45.880 --> 57:48.600
WN record or is it WN record?

57:48.600 --> 57:51.240
Because English is a silly language, but I'm going to guess record.

57:51.240 --> 57:53.240
WN record says it's nutty.

57:53.240 --> 57:56.960
How many companies are doing record business and still laying off?

57:56.960 --> 57:59.480
Well, that's CEO salaries.

58:00.000 --> 58:02.720
It has to do a lot with their projections

58:03.320 --> 58:06.520
and, you know, taking into account things like inflation,

58:06.520 --> 58:08.760
operating costs, ongoing projects.

58:09.360 --> 58:12.560
You can bring in a current higher profit

58:12.560 --> 58:15.080
that if it's not going to accommodate your projection.

58:16.280 --> 58:21.240
Or your expected operating costs in the next quarter or next year.

58:22.280 --> 58:25.520
Then. It actually makes perfect sense

58:25.520 --> 58:28.320
why they would try to take preventative measures

58:28.800 --> 58:32.080
to preserve their income rate.

58:32.160 --> 58:36.400
But you're also right, it does go back to the CEOs and and whatnot.

58:37.360 --> 58:39.840
Maximum wage laws.

58:39.840 --> 58:42.800
I also agree with Fixie that, quote,

58:42.800 --> 58:45.720
these kinds of layoffs during a global recession should be negligence.

58:45.720 --> 58:50.200
Absolutely. And I mean, you want to look at like what a good example is.

58:50.920 --> 58:53.600
Look at what Iwata did.

58:54.240 --> 58:58.240
Yes. When Nintendo took their big dip, it's the pay cut.

58:58.680 --> 59:01.880
And you know what? I think that should be the rule for a CEO.

59:02.240 --> 59:05.200
You know, if you're if your company is fucking up

59:05.200 --> 59:10.320
and you are the leader of said company, you take the hit, not your employees.

59:10.920 --> 59:14.000
People only think about themselves.

59:14.120 --> 59:18.560
Greed begets, you know, wealth begets greed is what I think.

59:19.040 --> 59:21.160
The more you have, the more you want.

59:21.160 --> 59:23.560
And you think someone's going to try to take it out of your hand.

59:23.560 --> 59:24.680
But guess what?

59:24.680 --> 59:28.360
You don't need as much money as you're making to live.

59:28.760 --> 59:31.840
You don't. And that is OK.

59:32.680 --> 59:37.480
The money that these people make, they can put it into a money market

59:37.480 --> 59:41.160
or a CD or something and live very comfortably

59:41.320 --> 59:43.920
and very extravagantly off of the interest.

59:43.920 --> 59:46.040
And that's the problem that we're having right there.

59:46.040 --> 59:47.840
All these fuckers need to get taxed.

59:47.840 --> 59:48.880
But that's another story.

59:48.880 --> 59:53.160
But that is why the gamers really respected Iwata and miss him greatly.

59:53.600 --> 59:55.400
He was one of the greats.

59:55.400 --> 59:58.440
So his memory be a blessing.

59:58.440 --> 59:59.680
In other Twitch news,

59:59.680 --> 01:00:03.080
we actually kind of have a companion article to this of some sort, Loki.

01:00:03.960 --> 01:00:09.200
Yeah. So, of course, you know, Twitch is saying that right now

01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:14.680
it's the best place for creators to stream and make money, apparently.

01:00:16.680 --> 01:00:18.680
I mean, sure, yeah, they're going to say that.

01:00:18.680 --> 01:00:21.160
I mean, why wouldn't they say that? They're always going to say that.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:26.000
But apparently talking with the Verge,

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:29.360
you know, Tom Varelli said that

01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:33.160
I don't think there's ever been a better time to start streaming on Twitch.

01:00:33.640 --> 01:00:36.000
We've talked a lot about how we're going.

01:00:36.040 --> 01:00:38.360
We're in this together and we're part of this innovation.

01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:42.120
We're we're committed to continuing to improve our monetization products

01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:44.840
and building new monetization products.

01:00:44.840 --> 01:00:45.760
At the end of the day,

01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:48.440
we are committed to increasing the amount of money streamers can earn.

01:00:49.840 --> 01:00:54.680
Oh, you know, I mean, because like you just like reduced your split of,

01:00:55.080 --> 01:01:01.080
you know, revenue from 70 30 down to like, you know, 50 50 for everybody.

01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:07.640
And then on top of that, like you have these new apparently

01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:13.160
ad incentive programs that you provide to certain affiliates.

01:01:13.160 --> 01:01:17.120
I guess that if you run a certain number of ads in an hour,

01:01:17.120 --> 01:01:21.400
a ridiculous number of ads, then they'll pay you like extra money.

01:01:21.400 --> 01:01:24.120
But it's not even really that much money on top of it.

01:01:24.680 --> 01:01:28.040
Um, not to mention that if you're running that many ads,

01:01:28.040 --> 01:01:30.280
you're probably going to lose engagement anyways.

01:01:30.280 --> 01:01:32.040
One of the other things, too, on top of that

01:01:32.040 --> 01:01:34.920
is that their ads program that they have right now,

01:01:34.920 --> 01:01:38.160
if you run less than three minutes of ads in an hour,

01:01:38.160 --> 01:01:41.840
you're actually only making 30 percent of the revenue from that, not even the 50.

01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:46.000
You have to run, I think, over three minutes of ads per hour

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:50.320
to get that full 50 to 55 amount from them.

01:01:50.600 --> 01:01:53.200
I didn't even know they changed that.

01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:55.800
So it's it's it's been like that for a while.

01:01:56.600 --> 01:01:59.000
Yeah. So it's just it's not really.

01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:02.880
I think they're going to have to try a lot harder ovens, you know?

01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:04.320
I mean, yeah.

01:02:04.600 --> 01:02:08.320
I mean, no company's going to come and go, yeah, we're just like terrible.

01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:10.600
Like maybe you shouldn't use our service.

01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:12.360
Like, of course, they're going to say

01:02:12.360 --> 01:02:15.440
you're the best place because they're going to do that.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.920
Um, I mean, what other choices you have, you have YouTube

01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:22.440
and then there's the other startup that just kick.

01:02:23.680 --> 01:02:25.640
Yeah, you're thinking of.

01:02:25.640 --> 01:02:26.480
Yeah, I think so.

01:02:26.480 --> 01:02:30.080
I'm I'm laughing because I just went on there this weekend just to claim my name,

01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:32.320
you know, just just in case, because you never know.

01:02:32.560 --> 01:02:34.000
But I was just kind of poking around.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:40.000
And it definitely like it just feels like a we want to be Twitch type of plan.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:43.200
Like I'm looking at the content that's being featured and I'm just like,

01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:45.120
none of this looks like something I'd enjoy.

01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:48.480
Sorry, I'm just telling it like it is like it's just I it just

01:02:48.840 --> 01:02:52.240
I wasn't seeing a lot of like compelling content

01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:54.360
from what I was seeing there on the screen.

01:02:54.360 --> 01:03:00.240
It looks like a lot of people who just want to be the next megabucks streamer

01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:03.600
and playing those types of games or gambling simulators or whatever it is.

01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:07.160
Like I just I was I looked at the website and I was bored.

01:03:07.560 --> 01:03:10.680
That was that was my quick review of kick.

01:03:10.680 --> 01:03:11.800
Sorry, but that's what I mean.

01:03:11.800 --> 01:03:13.840
And you know what? It's still young.

01:03:13.840 --> 01:03:14.800
It's in its infancy.

01:03:14.800 --> 01:03:16.920
May it grow into something bigger? Possibly.

01:03:16.920 --> 01:03:19.080
Could I be eating crow later on? Who knows?

01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:22.240
I'm just saying how I feel today and what what I saw in that site

01:03:22.240 --> 01:03:25.680
when I went today, but we'll see. So, yeah.

01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:33.880
I but it does seem like Twitch runs mainly unopposed.

01:03:33.880 --> 01:03:36.000
So I mean, I guess there's YouTube.

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:37.800
I guess you could count kick,

01:03:37.800 --> 01:03:39.960
but I don't think you can until they have a mobile app,

01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:41.880
which apparently is coming very soon.

01:03:41.880 --> 01:03:45.160
But, you know, until that day, none of these compared like

01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:48.840
and there's been every year there's some new up and comer

01:03:48.840 --> 01:03:50.520
that wants to take on Twitch.

01:03:50.520 --> 01:03:53.880
Unless you have a mobile app and you have some more integration

01:03:53.880 --> 01:03:58.720
on other devices than just PC screens, you can't be taken seriously. Period.

01:03:59.160 --> 01:04:03.720
So anybody that wants to take on somebody has to be able to at least

01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:05.760
bare minimum have a mobile app.

01:04:06.880 --> 01:04:11.320
To do that. Exactly, especially in this age. Seriously.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:15.960
An interesting perspective from Fixation Gaze here in chat,

01:04:15.960 --> 01:04:20.080
who says, just to add something to the best place for creators.

01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:22.120
A year ago, I had my own experiment.

01:04:22.520 --> 01:04:25.760
When I included the autistic tag on my screen streams,

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:30.160
I was less likely to end up recommended by about 75%.

01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:34.120
It's only the best for certain creators who start the game famous.

01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:37.720
Plus, most creators rely on subs to survive over ads.

01:04:37.720 --> 01:04:41.440
Oh, definitely. Ads, ads make literal pennies.

01:04:41.440 --> 01:04:44.920
I'm not, you know, even though I'm like, oh, they changed it like years ago

01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:47.840
and I wasn't paying attention. I'm like, it doesn't matter. It's pennies.

01:04:47.840 --> 01:04:51.200
If I don't have thousands of viewers, it's not going to matter.

01:04:51.560 --> 01:04:56.320
But, um, uh, but that's, that's very interesting about the tags,

01:04:56.320 --> 01:05:00.560
because something I do notice Twitch added just in the past couple of months

01:05:01.120 --> 01:05:03.560
was that you can see how your tags perform.

01:05:04.080 --> 01:05:06.640
And I am a little bit surprised, well, I'm not totally surprised,

01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:10.880
but a little surprised at which ones perform a lot stronger than others.

01:05:11.760 --> 01:05:13.840
And I think that was interesting.

01:05:13.840 --> 01:05:16.400
I don't know how to see how you're getting recommended, though.

01:05:16.440 --> 01:05:18.920
That's, that's interesting. So.

01:05:21.040 --> 01:05:23.880
All right. Well, let's move on. We have more news to cover.

01:05:23.880 --> 01:05:28.960
So let's talk about some news from Atari and a game

01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:32.840
that I remember Dark Soccer talking about on this show not a terribly long time ago

01:05:32.840 --> 01:05:36.000
in her Classic Game of the Week segment, and that was the game System Shock.

01:05:36.520 --> 01:05:40.000
Because System Shock has a remake that they've been working on for a while,

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.240
and we still don't know exactly when it's coming out.

01:05:42.240 --> 01:05:46.160
But the publisher, Prime Matter,

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:50.520
apparently is actually going to be getting picked up

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.560
by Atari, although this,

01:05:54.680 --> 01:05:59.480
the story I linked here has to do with that we do have a date of May 30th

01:05:59.760 --> 01:06:01.440
for that actual release.

01:06:02.360 --> 01:06:06.920
This has been in development since 2015,

01:06:07.240 --> 01:06:11.080
and it was originally supposed to come in the summer of 2021.

01:06:11.080 --> 01:06:14.360
And this, of course, is a remake of the 1994 first person RPG

01:06:14.560 --> 01:06:18.600
that's going to be coming for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One,

01:06:18.600 --> 01:06:20.720
and Xbox Series X.

01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:26.920
But Atari is also purchasing Night Dive Studios,

01:06:27.160 --> 01:06:30.280
and they're buying it for 10 million in cash.

01:06:30.560 --> 01:06:33.840
And this is supposed to help Atari expand their catalog

01:06:34.080 --> 01:06:39.520
and using technology and boosting a retro focused strategy.

01:06:40.280 --> 01:06:44.760
Although a lot of those recent retro releases out of Atari have not been bad.

01:06:45.040 --> 01:06:48.640
So, you know, I don't mind if they're kind of continuing to lean into that

01:06:48.640 --> 01:06:51.680
because a lot of the recent releases really haven't been bad.

01:06:52.280 --> 01:06:55.160
But as we know, I mean, and certainly it's better than some of the other stuff

01:06:55.160 --> 01:06:59.200
Atari's gotten into recently, like crypto, online casinos,

01:06:59.440 --> 01:07:01.920
and they're bringing up themed hotels here.

01:07:02.960 --> 01:07:04.800
We never did see the hotel.

01:07:04.800 --> 01:07:07.120
Let's give that one a chance first.

01:07:07.120 --> 01:07:11.200
I thought that sounded interesting, but no hotel as of yet anyway.

01:07:12.080 --> 01:07:18.360
So anyway, Night Dive should be helping them to bolster their actual game

01:07:18.360 --> 01:07:22.840
library a little bit with things that aren't necessarily just the retro stuff.

01:07:23.280 --> 01:07:27.240
So, all right, moving on, Dark Soccer.

01:07:29.200 --> 01:07:33.560
Couldn't hit get my button hit fast enough.

01:07:34.600 --> 01:07:39.040
There's a comic that I was super into, so excited about when it came out,

01:07:39.040 --> 01:07:42.600
which was I've been reading the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

01:07:42.800 --> 01:07:45.160
more recent issues, which I super love.

01:07:46.040 --> 01:07:49.600
But there was a series that came out called The Last Ronin,

01:07:49.960 --> 01:07:56.880
which is about this sort of super futuristic New York area.

01:07:57.280 --> 01:08:01.400
And of the four turtles, only one of them survived.

01:08:02.600 --> 01:08:06.400
And you don't find out who it is until the end of the issue.

01:08:07.200 --> 01:08:11.400
But they are working on a game based on it.

01:08:11.600 --> 01:08:14.160
It is a really good series, but it is dark.

01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:16.600
It was published in 2020.

01:08:16.600 --> 01:08:19.200
It was a five issue miniseries by IDW.

01:08:21.280 --> 01:08:24.920
So at any rate, the game is going to play something

01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:27.840
they're actually working with Paramount,

01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:32.360
but it's going to be a little bit more adult themed,

01:08:33.720 --> 01:08:37.080
a little bit darker, grittier,

01:08:38.640 --> 01:08:41.600
and it's supposed to play as they've outlined

01:08:41.680 --> 01:08:43.840
a little bit more like God of War,

01:08:45.320 --> 01:08:46.800
you know, very mature.

01:08:46.800 --> 01:08:49.560
They don't OK, they don't have a developer yet,

01:08:49.960 --> 01:08:53.640
and they think it's going to be at least a few years out

01:08:53.640 --> 01:08:55.920
from any sort of release date.

01:08:55.920 --> 01:09:00.840
But I think it's I think it's pretty I would play the hell out of it.

01:09:00.840 --> 01:09:01.680
I really liked it.

01:09:03.160 --> 01:09:05.400
I have to admit, I didn't know a lot about it until I saw the story,

01:09:05.400 --> 01:09:07.880
because, you know, anything Ninja Turtle related Tiger Claw

01:09:07.880 --> 01:09:08.760
posts in our Discord.

01:09:08.760 --> 01:09:09.640
So that's how I saw it.

01:09:09.640 --> 01:09:11.840
And I was kind of like looking at it going, oh, that's interesting.

01:09:11.840 --> 01:09:12.920
I didn't like the new movie.

01:09:12.920 --> 01:09:14.480
I didn't even know that was a thing.

01:09:14.480 --> 01:09:17.400
Yeah. And then.

01:09:17.400 --> 01:09:18.480
Wait, new movie?

01:09:18.480 --> 01:09:20.600
Yeah, there's a new animated movie that's coming out.

01:09:20.920 --> 01:09:23.320
The animation style is sort of like the

01:09:24.040 --> 01:09:26.360
not exactly, but kind of like the

01:09:27.400 --> 01:09:31.920
enter the Spider-Verse stuff, like it's that karmic, a comic panel style.

01:09:32.120 --> 01:09:33.320
It looks really nice.

01:09:33.320 --> 01:09:35.960
Like it, I think it's going to be cool.

01:09:35.960 --> 01:09:39.480
Well, but anyway, the big thing that I'm looking forward to

01:09:39.480 --> 01:09:42.160
is seeing how the different weapons are incorporated,

01:09:42.160 --> 01:09:44.960
because the survivor carries the weapons of all four of them.

01:09:46.120 --> 01:09:48.080
And on top of that,

01:09:48.080 --> 01:09:53.440
in the comic, he would hear sort of, I guess, like the voices of his brothers.

01:09:54.360 --> 01:09:56.120
And talk to them.

01:09:56.120 --> 01:10:00.760
So I'm wondering if maybe hearing those different voices in gameplay might,

01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:05.800
you know, access, like like talk, talk to the voice of this one

01:10:05.800 --> 01:10:09.600
to get insight on this might give you different pointers

01:10:09.600 --> 01:10:11.120
and clues throughout the game.

01:10:11.120 --> 01:10:11.840
I think that would be cool.

01:10:13.520 --> 01:10:15.920
All right. Yeah, I'm looking forward to it.

01:10:15.920 --> 01:10:18.720
And if you want to join our Discord to talk about,

01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:21.240
you know, Ninja Turtles or other things throughout the weeks,

01:10:21.240 --> 01:10:23.280
we get a lot of neat news

01:10:23.280 --> 01:10:26.600
posted in the Orange Dance Radio channel and some of our other channels as well.

01:10:27.120 --> 01:10:29.800
Head on over to our Discord over at vognetwork.com.

01:10:29.800 --> 01:10:32.440
That's vognetwork.com slash Discord.

01:10:33.400 --> 01:10:37.440
All right. This this next story is is something else, Loki.

01:10:39.680 --> 01:10:42.800
Yeah, it's it's unique, that's for sure.

01:10:42.800 --> 01:10:51.000
So apparently there is a game that's been made by MSCHF,

01:10:51.400 --> 01:10:53.360
which is a Brooklyn based art company

01:10:54.800 --> 01:10:57.320
that is called Tax Heaven 3000.

01:10:57.320 --> 01:11:03.280
It is a dating sim that helps you do your taxes.

01:11:05.800 --> 01:11:07.640
It's interesting for sure.

01:11:09.760 --> 01:11:12.640
So it will actually help you walk through

01:11:12.880 --> 01:11:16.840
the process of filing a 1040 US tax return.

01:11:17.720 --> 01:11:21.640
The problem is, though, it's been delisted off of the websites

01:11:21.640 --> 01:11:24.800
that it's been on, probably because it asks for your Social Security number,

01:11:24.800 --> 01:11:29.680
which, yes, that is part of the tax process, is providing that information.

01:11:29.680 --> 01:11:32.000
However, would I trust the game to do that?

01:11:34.720 --> 01:11:36.360
Questionable.

01:11:36.360 --> 01:11:39.640
It doesn't appear that the game is supposed to connect to the Internet,

01:11:40.120 --> 01:11:42.800
but still kind of fishy.

01:11:42.800 --> 01:11:45.440
So it has been removed from Steam.

01:11:45.440 --> 01:11:49.160
And I think the download is not available anymore for itch.io either.

01:11:49.160 --> 01:11:50.520
But it looks silly.

01:11:50.520 --> 01:11:54.000
And, you know, it does allow you to actually file your taxes.

01:11:54.200 --> 01:11:58.040
But, you know, to be fair, I mean, tax season is right now.

01:11:58.040 --> 01:12:00.680
And I mean, there's lots of free websites that you can do it through

01:12:00.680 --> 01:12:04.200
that are way more reputable and probably

01:12:04.200 --> 01:12:06.480
a lot more easier to actually file your taxes.

01:12:06.480 --> 01:12:08.800
But it's still a novel idea.

01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:12.560
I it's interesting because I heard this story at first and I kind of laughed at it.

01:12:12.560 --> 01:12:14.800
And I went, LOL, of course, there's something like this.

01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:19.000
But then the more I thought about it, I was like, is this is this really so bad?

01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:24.760
Like, it's not like I think this is more respectable

01:12:24.760 --> 01:12:27.280
than some of the things these companies try to pull over.

01:12:27.520 --> 01:12:31.600
And some of these websites that have you do your taxes, that bombard you with spam.

01:12:31.880 --> 01:12:35.440
Oh, it looks like you forgot to finish your taxes or trying to upsell

01:12:35.440 --> 01:12:36.960
all this other stuff and all this other crap.

01:12:36.960 --> 01:12:41.840
Like I there's a part of me that kind of looks at this and goes in a weird way.

01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:45.520
This is this is it's either satire and it's really good satire,

01:12:45.840 --> 01:12:51.040
or it's a really interesting way to try to get a hold of a market

01:12:51.320 --> 01:12:56.720
that otherwise doesn't usually think about a fun way to kind of do this stuff.

01:12:57.680 --> 01:13:02.040
Well, yeah, taxes are a slog a lot of times, so it's an interesting idea.

01:13:02.280 --> 01:13:06.040
If if there was some way to like, they could have like an independent

01:13:06.040 --> 01:13:09.360
security firm or something like that, take a look at it, make sure like, OK,

01:13:09.360 --> 01:13:12.880
hey, we're certifying that this isn't going to send your social security

01:13:12.880 --> 01:13:16.360
number and personal information out on the Internet, then.

01:13:16.360 --> 01:13:17.840
Yeah, sure. You know, why not?

01:13:17.840 --> 01:13:18.760
Let's let's roll with it.

01:13:18.760 --> 01:13:21.760
But like, I think that's just where people are a little weary,

01:13:21.760 --> 01:13:24.840
because, like, you know, you all know who these developers are.

01:13:24.840 --> 01:13:28.720
I mean, obviously, these this company has worked with like big names

01:13:28.720 --> 01:13:31.080
like Lil Nas X and stuff on other projects.

01:13:31.560 --> 01:13:35.080
So they're somewhat reputable, but like, you know, you can never tell

01:13:35.080 --> 01:13:37.160
like who's developing your games and stuff like that.

01:13:37.160 --> 01:13:38.480
You don't know.

01:13:38.480 --> 01:13:39.880
You wouldn't want to trust them

01:13:39.880 --> 01:13:43.400
with that kind of information because leaks happen all the time. So

01:13:44.680 --> 01:13:47.040
that's the only thing I think people are a little bit wary on.

01:13:47.040 --> 01:13:50.560
And obviously, that's probably why it's been delisted off of there.

01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:55.120
But like, I mean, I assume security side,

01:13:55.400 --> 01:13:58.400
you know, security aside, if if it were completely secure.

01:13:58.600 --> 01:13:59.800
Yeah, I think it's a great idea.

01:13:59.800 --> 01:14:01.280
I think it's cool.

01:14:01.760 --> 01:14:04.480
Well, this is so Fixation Gaze has a comment in chat here,

01:14:04.480 --> 01:14:07.080
and then I think it kind of leans into what you're talking about,

01:14:07.080 --> 01:14:07.960
where you're going with this.

01:14:07.960 --> 01:14:10.720
Fixation Gaze says TurboTax makes it racing themed.

01:14:10.720 --> 01:14:12.880
I'd rather date a cute girl.

01:14:12.880 --> 01:14:14.960
And Dark Soccer, I saw you said same.

01:14:14.960 --> 01:14:19.960
And I and that's the thing is that I can't help but feel like

01:14:20.560 --> 01:14:21.880
who's the company behind TurboTax?

01:14:21.880 --> 01:14:23.560
Intuit, I think is the name of them.

01:14:23.560 --> 01:14:27.400
I can't help but feel like come tax season 2024,

01:14:27.400 --> 01:14:30.920
or I guess it would be tax season 2023 in 2024.

01:14:30.920 --> 01:14:31.960
You know what I mean?

01:14:31.960 --> 01:14:35.280
I can't help but feel like Intuit is going to see what's going on here.

01:14:35.560 --> 01:14:39.480
And they're I'm not saying they're going to have an anime thing,

01:14:39.480 --> 01:14:41.560
but they're going to have they're going to be like, ooh,

01:14:41.800 --> 01:14:45.800
what if we did like a video game, more immersive type of approach

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:49.720
and hire like an outsourced developer to do some type of thing

01:14:49.920 --> 01:14:53.360
and like put it together and do that whole thing and have it through that?

01:14:54.080 --> 01:14:55.720
I have to end Fixation Gaze.

01:14:55.720 --> 01:14:57.920
I understand you're saying, God, I hope so.

01:14:57.920 --> 01:15:00.160
KFC did a love sim and it was popular as hell.

01:15:00.640 --> 01:15:01.680
In a way, yes.

01:15:01.680 --> 01:15:05.200
But I actually have to say, if Intuit was allowed to do that now,

01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:07.160
I'd actually be kind of pissed off.

01:15:08.960 --> 01:15:10.400
That this got shut down.

01:15:10.400 --> 01:15:13.440
Now, granted, it is the fault of the company that put this together

01:15:13.440 --> 01:15:16.600
to not think about those security motions in place and dah, dah, dah, dah.

01:15:16.880 --> 01:15:20.520
But I would be more irritated at the fact that the big company

01:15:20.520 --> 01:15:24.560
took the little company's idea because they had a legal department

01:15:24.560 --> 01:15:27.720
to make it better, make it more functional, if you will.

01:15:27.920 --> 01:15:31.800
That part of it would kind of piss me off, I think.

01:15:33.120 --> 01:15:35.320
But I feel I feel like.

01:15:36.760 --> 01:15:40.640
And thank you, he says, oh, that's so fair, I want them to hire them,

01:15:40.640 --> 01:15:43.840
give the small guys money, much better solution, I like that.

01:15:44.480 --> 01:15:47.440
But I feel like that's not a company like just sorry,

01:15:47.440 --> 01:15:50.160
just based on the behaviors I see in the TurboTax software and all that.

01:15:50.400 --> 01:15:51.960
I feel like they're going to go to somewhere

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.840
they can get an outsource in another country

01:15:55.160 --> 01:16:00.480
and have it developed to be like this and do that whole thing.

01:16:00.800 --> 01:16:02.280
Yeah. So watch it.

01:16:02.280 --> 01:16:04.640
It's going to be next year's tax season.

01:16:04.640 --> 01:16:07.280
So apparently, even though it's been delisted from Steam,

01:16:07.280 --> 01:16:09.120
so itch.io still has it up.

01:16:09.120 --> 01:16:11.160
I didn't realize that the game is not actually out yet.

01:16:11.160 --> 01:16:12.960
So it's coming out April 4th.

01:16:12.960 --> 01:16:15.920
So if you're still interested, it is on itch.io.

01:16:16.320 --> 01:16:18.800
You can still get it that way.

01:16:18.840 --> 01:16:20.240
How do you ultimately file?

01:16:20.280 --> 01:16:23.400
Does it e-transmit or do you like since, or do you print?

01:16:24.400 --> 01:16:27.880
It's basically it looks like that you.

01:16:28.680 --> 01:16:31.360
Yeah, you can either print or download it when you're done.

01:16:31.360 --> 01:16:34.520
So it basically fills up the form for you and then you print or download it.

01:16:34.520 --> 01:16:37.600
And I guess you would e-file that way somehow. I don't know.

01:16:38.200 --> 01:16:40.520
I'll be perfectly honest.

01:16:40.520 --> 01:16:43.840
I don't want my tax thing as a game. I'm sorry.

01:16:44.560 --> 01:16:46.600
I would rather fill out the form.

01:16:47.560 --> 01:16:51.800
Have it be uninteresting, but factual without any fluff.

01:16:52.920 --> 01:16:56.080
And get my taxes filed and get my money.

01:16:57.400 --> 01:16:59.400
Taxes don't need to be a game.

01:16:59.400 --> 01:17:01.560
I can see pros and cons to both.

01:17:01.560 --> 01:17:02.960
I love the choice.

01:17:02.960 --> 01:17:07.320
And to me, this is very similar to traffic school.

01:17:07.920 --> 01:17:09.560
And how do you like, you know, obviously,

01:17:09.560 --> 01:17:11.800
we all try to avoid getting a ticket and all that stuff.

01:17:12.160 --> 01:17:15.680
But if you ever get a ticket, you could go to stand up comedy

01:17:15.680 --> 01:17:18.640
traffic school if you want, where the whole thing is.

01:17:18.640 --> 01:17:21.280
Yeah. And I already see Rolling Your Eyes, Dark Sakura.

01:17:21.520 --> 01:17:24.120
And that would honestly, that probably be what I would want to do.

01:17:24.320 --> 01:17:28.280
But if you want to go to a, for lack of a better term,

01:17:28.440 --> 01:17:31.920
normal traffic school, that's just, all right, give me the facts.

01:17:31.920 --> 01:17:35.280
Just don't don't be funny about it. Just normal classroom.

01:17:35.280 --> 01:17:38.040
Let's get this over with online training.

01:17:38.040 --> 01:17:41.400
And just did the test and was done in 10 minutes.

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:44.520
So but there's that choice.

01:17:44.520 --> 01:17:48.240
So I like that that would be kind of available. So.

01:17:49.280 --> 01:17:52.240
And yes, April 15th is typically tax day,

01:17:52.240 --> 01:17:55.520
although holidays have been fluctuating that day a little bit weird calendars.

01:17:55.520 --> 01:17:57.080
It's around the 15th.

01:17:57.080 --> 01:17:59.360
So it looks like April 18th this year.

01:17:59.360 --> 01:18:04.200
And also this year there's like things like with the weather and stuff.

01:18:04.200 --> 01:18:06.800
I think that it's possible for certain people to have it delayed

01:18:06.800 --> 01:18:09.000
until like September even. But.

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.160
Yeah. Yeah.

01:18:13.640 --> 01:18:15.520
So fixation is April 1st,

01:18:15.520 --> 01:18:19.400
maybe the cutoff for TurboTax before the prices go up,

01:18:19.640 --> 01:18:22.440
because the last two weeks before you file your taxes,

01:18:22.440 --> 01:18:25.960
they're going to jack those prices sky high because that's what those companies do.

01:18:26.320 --> 01:18:27.440
Just don't use TurboTax.

01:18:27.440 --> 01:18:29.760
Seriously, like there's websites out there

01:18:29.760 --> 01:18:33.040
that you can use that are probably way more intuitive.

01:18:33.040 --> 01:18:34.720
And I think it's like.

01:18:35.240 --> 01:18:39.400
It's free to e-file your just regular federal

01:18:39.400 --> 01:18:43.120
and if you want to your state of things like 17 bucks, it's like it's so.

01:18:43.480 --> 01:18:45.520
Minimal. And I do it every year.

01:18:46.560 --> 01:18:49.000
Yeah, it's just so easy.

01:18:49.200 --> 01:18:53.480
Our our lady who used to help us, she passed away a few years ago.

01:18:54.600 --> 01:18:56.400
R.I.P. Kathy.

01:18:56.400 --> 01:19:01.280
But but yeah, she basically walked us through so many different things

01:19:01.280 --> 01:19:04.600
that we just use the age in our block software. Yeah.

01:19:06.120 --> 01:19:09.000
All right. Anyway, tax tips from Orange Lounge Radio.

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.240
Bet you didn't know you'd get that this week. All right.

01:19:11.280 --> 01:19:13.880
Moving on, let's go to one more.

01:19:13.880 --> 01:19:15.880
If you're confused, hire an accountant.

01:19:15.880 --> 01:19:18.360
Yeah, that's that's very true.

01:19:18.360 --> 01:19:20.240
Disclaimer, we are not accountants.

01:19:20.240 --> 01:19:22.680
We're just, you know, nerds of the podcast. All right.

01:19:23.320 --> 01:19:26.320
I can rock an actuarial table for your mortgage, OK?

01:19:27.840 --> 01:19:30.200
I used to work for a mortgage company.

01:19:30.200 --> 01:19:33.240
All right. Well, here's what you can expect to hear on Orange Lounge Radio

01:19:33.240 --> 01:19:36.200
every single goddamn week for the next two years.

01:19:36.200 --> 01:19:39.240
No, the Activision Blizzard Microsoft deal.

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:44.840
What's the latest and greatest MST3K?

01:19:45.680 --> 01:19:47.720
Well, whoopty shit.

01:19:47.720 --> 01:19:50.200
Well, some people are saying whoopty shit this week

01:19:50.200 --> 01:19:53.720
because there was a pretty big hurdle that was actually cleared in all of this.

01:19:53.720 --> 01:19:56.360
And that is the UK regulators.

01:19:56.360 --> 01:19:59.480
The UK regulators did announce a provisional finding

01:19:59.800 --> 01:20:03.280
that the acquisition of Activision Blizzard by Microsoft

01:20:03.520 --> 01:20:06.040
wouldn't harm competition.

01:20:06.040 --> 01:20:09.120
So there's not going to be a need, at least in the UK,

01:20:09.120 --> 01:20:12.120
again, this has to still clear the US and, you know, other global markets,

01:20:12.360 --> 01:20:16.280
but that there's no need to spin off Call of Duty and so forth.

01:20:16.760 --> 01:20:22.200
In a quote, the CMA Competition of Markets Authority in the UK said in a quote,

01:20:22.960 --> 01:20:25.840
while the CMA's original analysis indicated

01:20:26.080 --> 01:20:29.800
that the strategy would be profitable under most scenarios, new data,

01:20:29.800 --> 01:20:32.360
which provides better insight into the actual purchasing behavior

01:20:32.360 --> 01:20:35.920
of Call of Duty gamers indicates that this strategy would be significantly

01:20:35.920 --> 01:20:38.200
loss making under any plausible scenario.

01:20:38.520 --> 01:20:42.360
On this basis, meaning if they were to make Call of Duty exclusive to Microsoft,

01:20:42.360 --> 01:20:44.480
it would actually lose Microsoft money.

01:20:44.480 --> 01:20:48.440
On this basis, the updated analysis now shows that would not be commercially

01:20:48.440 --> 01:20:52.400
beneficial to Microsoft to make Call of Duty exclusive to Xbox following the deal,

01:20:52.520 --> 01:20:55.600
but that Microsoft will instead still have the incentive

01:20:55.600 --> 01:20:57.800
to continue making the game available on PlayStation.

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.360
It all comes down to Call of Duty.

01:21:00.360 --> 01:21:04.760
Now, CMA is still investigating cloud gaming and Game Pass.

01:21:04.760 --> 01:21:08.320
No decision on that is expected until 26th April,

01:21:08.320 --> 01:21:09.640
since we are talking about the UK here.

01:21:11.320 --> 01:21:14.720
They're still looking at Game Pass, but Call of Duty was sort of viewed

01:21:14.720 --> 01:21:18.160
to be the biggest sticking point in this entire thing.

01:21:18.280 --> 01:21:22.920
And now that that's cleared by the UK, this is a huge hurdle cleared for this.

01:21:23.040 --> 01:21:27.440
And a lot of people that were kind of betting on this, metaphorically,

01:21:28.280 --> 01:21:32.120
were assuming that the UK was going to put a stop to this and it was going to be over.

01:21:32.240 --> 01:21:38.040
So the fact that this went through now and a lot of this, too, is kind of Sony's own fault.

01:21:38.720 --> 01:21:43.880
And so because Sony admitted that they were just trying to stop this deal,

01:21:43.880 --> 01:21:48.280
that they really don't have a financial that that was going to be that's going to be looked

01:21:48.280 --> 01:21:52.680
at as a defining moment in this whole thing, the way that Sony kind of botched that answer,

01:21:52.920 --> 01:21:54.800
although it was also an honest answer.

01:21:54.800 --> 01:21:56.560
Let's be real. It was the answer.

01:21:57.160 --> 01:22:04.200
So anyhow, SHO 100 Matt says the FTC and whatever members of Congress will make a scene

01:22:04.200 --> 01:22:07.960
for in a few weeks in the public sphere, but I still think this deal happens.

01:22:07.960 --> 01:22:12.280
Oh, if that whole stuff with TikTok is any indication.

01:22:12.280 --> 01:22:13.320
Oh, boy.

01:22:13.880 --> 01:22:17.960
But I don't think I don't think I mean, you're not going to see that in this type of thing.

01:22:17.960 --> 01:22:20.520
I'm being a little bit dramatic.

01:22:20.520 --> 01:22:24.920
You're not going to see them in front of well, I don't think I guess anything could happen.

01:22:24.920 --> 01:22:28.680
But procedurally, that is not something that should be happening as a part of that.

01:22:28.960 --> 01:22:36.600
So anyway, all right, let's move let's move on to a simpler time when Congress didn't understand

01:22:36.600 --> 01:22:37.400
video games at all.

01:22:37.400 --> 01:22:38.640
Well, actually, that still is the case.

01:22:38.640 --> 01:22:41.400
But anyway, we're going to just move on to our next segment.

01:22:41.400 --> 01:22:57.560
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull

01:22:57.560 --> 01:22:59.400
out a classic and tell you about it.

01:22:59.800 --> 01:23:02.520
It's time for the classic game of the week.

01:23:03.080 --> 01:23:05.800
Um, who picked the classic game this week?

01:23:05.800 --> 01:23:08.640
Because is this is this a secret Loki pick?

01:23:08.640 --> 01:23:09.560
What's going on here?

01:23:09.560 --> 01:23:10.800
This looks like a Loki pick.

01:23:11.760 --> 01:23:13.440
No, but I thought of Loki when I think.

01:23:13.800 --> 01:23:14.080
All right.

01:23:14.080 --> 01:23:15.560
What is the game of the week?

01:23:16.280 --> 01:23:18.280
The game of the week is Grand Theft Auto Vice City.

01:23:18.400 --> 01:23:19.080
Wow.

01:23:19.960 --> 01:23:27.080
And yes, it's actually a a twenty one year old game.

01:23:27.080 --> 01:23:27.920
It can drink.

01:23:29.360 --> 01:23:31.880
It's as old as this show about.

01:23:34.160 --> 01:23:37.480
And I picked it actually for for certain certain reasons.

01:23:37.480 --> 01:23:45.760
Um, but yeah, I know I almost went with Grand Theft Auto three because Grand Theft Auto

01:23:45.760 --> 01:23:52.880
three was the first one to abandon that sort of overhead view and go on to the the third

01:23:52.880 --> 01:23:53.640
person view.

01:23:53.720 --> 01:24:00.240
But Vice City had some massive improvements over Grand Theft Auto three.

01:24:00.240 --> 01:24:05.800
And while Grand Theft Auto three went into creating immersion and a story and everything,

01:24:06.120 --> 01:24:09.320
I really think the formula was perfected with Vice City.

01:24:10.040 --> 01:24:15.760
So, um, to go back into this, there were a lot.

01:24:16.280 --> 01:24:21.600
Well, again, it was it came out in 2002, an action adventure game developed by Rockstar

01:24:21.600 --> 01:24:27.200
North, published by Rockstar Games, and it is the fourth Grand Theft Auto game and I'm

01:24:27.200 --> 01:24:30.120
sorry, the fourth in the series and the sixth installment overall.

01:24:30.800 --> 01:24:41.640
It is set in 1986 with a pretty freaking amazing soundtrack, just saying where you are in Vice

01:24:41.640 --> 01:24:49.840
City, which is based off of Miami and Miami Beach, and you follow a mobster named Tommy,

01:24:50.160 --> 01:24:59.200
who has been released from jail and is it's his rise to power again, but not necessarily

01:24:59.200 --> 01:25:08.120
just that, but his, you know, just a statement about the area, about the time, about that

01:25:08.120 --> 01:25:10.840
world, of course, you know, a little bit more glamorized.

01:25:11.400 --> 01:25:15.960
But the you know, the great thing about the game that started again with Grand Theft Auto

01:25:15.960 --> 01:25:24.640
three is that it's an open open world, you know, it's and it's got real people in it,

01:25:24.640 --> 01:25:35.520
you know, like it touches on the immigration issues that were going on in Miami and along

01:25:35.520 --> 01:25:43.760
the Gulf Coast, especially with Cuban, Haitian immigrants, biker games, the crack epidemic,

01:25:44.800 --> 01:25:47.280
the and a glam glam metal.

01:25:47.680 --> 01:25:53.240
We can't forget glam metal, you know, the whole the whole beautiful butt rock back in the

01:25:53.280 --> 01:26:03.320
day. But the game itself had two major influences and it was Scarface and Miami Vice, you know,

01:26:03.920 --> 01:26:06.040
the original Miami Vice, not the remake.

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.360
Yeah, very, very Scarface.

01:26:10.040 --> 01:26:20.840
But it had they they started off with those sort of blueprints, the universe idea, and then

01:26:20.840 --> 01:26:25.320
they built their game world to fit that inspiration in that general time field.

01:26:26.240 --> 01:26:35.360
They had the team spend a lot of time in Miami and looking at landmarks and trying to

01:26:35.440 --> 01:26:36.680
recreate some of these.

01:26:36.680 --> 01:26:39.760
And that's been an ongoing theme in a lot of the Grand Theft Auto games.

01:26:40.200 --> 01:26:47.440
I mean, like Liberty City is based off New York and has, you know, some recreations of

01:26:47.440 --> 01:26:51.840
some of those, you know, areas at least trying to fit those areas where San Andreas had,

01:26:51.840 --> 01:26:57.040
like, you know, the the Chinese theater, for example, and other parts of Los Angeles.

01:26:58.560 --> 01:27:05.400
But going back, going back to this one, this game was actually considered as one of the

01:27:05.400 --> 01:27:08.280
greatest video games ever made by many, many lists.

01:27:08.560 --> 01:27:13.600
And it made Game of the Year for a bunch of different publications.

01:27:14.040 --> 01:27:17.240
It has gotten so many ports.

01:27:18.080 --> 01:27:20.760
We'll get into that a little bit later.

01:27:23.360 --> 01:27:28.680
But anyway, as I was saying, it's an action adventure game is played from third person.

01:27:28.680 --> 01:27:37.760
You play Tommy Verchetti, who has different story objectives that he needs to achieve.

01:27:37.760 --> 01:27:44.600
And then there's also little side jobs and there's a free roaming aspect, very open world.

01:27:45.520 --> 01:27:48.280
And you can just do nothing but explore.

01:27:48.280 --> 01:27:53.800
You can spend a day just doing whatever you want, like actual people do.

01:27:54.720 --> 01:27:59.440
And it is composed on these two islands with several small areas within like, you know,

01:27:59.840 --> 01:28:06.640
like a neighborhood, you know, the islands unlock more areas as the story progresses.

01:28:06.640 --> 01:28:11.920
You know, you run, jump, drive, you have melee attacks, you have all kinds of weapons

01:28:11.920 --> 01:28:19.560
and explosives, such as a Colt Python, an M60 machine gun, a minigun, a sniper rifle,

01:28:19.560 --> 01:28:23.800
a rocket launcher, you know, because I everyone doesn't ever have like a rocket

01:28:23.800 --> 01:28:25.520
launcher just hanging out in their trunk or something.

01:28:26.080 --> 01:28:27.120
Oh, yeah, in the garage.

01:28:27.840 --> 01:28:35.240
Yeah, but you you actually, you know, can purchase illegal weapons from firearm dealers.

01:28:35.400 --> 01:28:37.360
You can find them on the ground.

01:28:37.480 --> 01:28:38.840
That always makes me laugh.

01:28:39.120 --> 01:28:41.800
You retrieve them, you know, from dead people or just in general area.

01:28:41.800 --> 01:28:46.800
You have an auto aim feature and you have your your health meter.

01:28:46.800 --> 01:28:48.040
You can pick up health pickups.

01:28:48.040 --> 01:28:49.280
You can get body armor.

01:28:51.080 --> 01:28:57.720
And then, of course, when you, quote, die in game, you respawn at the at the hospital,

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:01.200
losing your weapons and armor and some of your money.

01:29:02.160 --> 01:29:07.240
And then, of course, you associate with her, Matt says, I mean, it is Florida,

01:29:08.600 --> 01:29:14.200
but you also can commit crimes and it builds up your wanted meter on your HUD.

01:29:14.560 --> 01:29:17.480
And so it increases the more crimes you commit.

01:29:19.240 --> 01:29:26.400
And so your wanted meter, if you're encountered, like, say, by police, you

01:29:26.400 --> 01:29:32.480
have to drive around or turn off or hide to get them off of your ass.

01:29:33.120 --> 01:29:38.080
So like there's all kinds of other like interesting little mini games in there,

01:29:38.400 --> 01:29:44.920
like vigilante vigilantism, firefighting, paramedics driving a taxi.

01:29:46.080 --> 01:29:51.600
You can buy businesses like a porn studio and a taxi company.

01:29:51.960 --> 01:29:56.360
You can own clubs, you know, all kinds of stuff like that.

01:29:56.520 --> 01:30:00.720
And then, you know, and I'm not going to get too much into the story.

01:30:00.720 --> 01:30:05.800
If you really if you haven't already played it and you care about it, there's videos.

01:30:07.120 --> 01:30:16.200
But but the particular game was started when GTA three was finishing its completion.

01:30:17.440 --> 01:30:23.160
Just early development, like 3D models, really just getting that off the ground.

01:30:23.160 --> 01:30:28.800
And then they were talking about like making a mission pack for GTA three.

01:30:29.280 --> 01:30:34.160
And then instead of that, as they were going through it, they decided to make a GTA four.

01:30:35.280 --> 01:30:40.480
The game was announced on May 22nd, 2002 at E3.

01:30:41.480 --> 01:30:46.360
And it was at the time, Rockstar's North most expensive game.

01:30:46.400 --> 01:30:48.840
The budget exceeded five million.

01:30:48.840 --> 01:30:54.240
And then they had to postpone it a little bit and then.

01:30:56.480 --> 01:30:59.840
It had like a number of various releases.

01:31:00.280 --> 01:31:05.680
It was released for PlayStation two on October 29th in North America, November 8th in Europe.

01:31:05.720 --> 01:31:07.280
This is in 2002.

01:31:07.680 --> 01:31:12.640
Capcom published the game in Japan on May 20th, 2004 for PS2 and Windows,

01:31:12.960 --> 01:31:17.080
and it was added to the Rockstar Games Launcher in September of 2002.

01:31:17.080 --> 01:31:20.400
Rockstar Games Launcher in September 2019.

01:31:22.640 --> 01:31:25.840
Now, I'll be honest, it's not my kind of game.

01:31:25.880 --> 01:31:27.360
I don't enjoy.

01:31:28.600 --> 01:31:34.640
The themes of the game, however, I fucking love watching people play it because I like

01:31:34.640 --> 01:31:43.280
seeing how in depth the universe that these people live in, how how in depth and involved it is.

01:31:43.280 --> 01:31:44.880
It's like, you know, me watching a movie.

01:31:45.080 --> 01:31:47.760
The movie could be utter shit with the worst actors ever.

01:31:47.760 --> 01:31:53.880
But if it has an engaging universe, I'm down, you know, like.

01:31:55.200 --> 01:31:58.520
I'm not going to name any other examples on there, but it really

01:31:59.920 --> 01:32:06.200
you can even see it if you look at the cover of the game, that that major Miami vice

01:32:06.200 --> 01:32:13.040
with the pastels and the and the neons, just that whole I mean, sort of like how the retro

01:32:13.040 --> 01:32:17.600
new wave things started coming back up a few years ago, very much makes me think of that.

01:32:17.880 --> 01:32:20.760
So how well did it do when I make a guess?

01:32:21.640 --> 01:32:24.560
Damn well, it printed money, it printed money.

01:32:26.680 --> 01:32:33.800
Metacritic calculated an average store, a store, a score of ninety five out of a hundred.

01:32:34.600 --> 01:32:36.280
That's pretty damn good.

01:32:38.640 --> 01:32:42.040
It is the fifth highest rated PS2 game overall.

01:32:43.480 --> 01:32:45.960
Tied with a few others, but, you know, overall,

01:32:47.840 --> 01:32:51.920
a lot of the criticism for the game had more to do with the controls

01:32:51.920 --> 01:32:54.560
and a few technical issues than anything else in the game.

01:32:54.920 --> 01:32:58.120
It was considered to be one of the most impressive games.

01:32:58.560 --> 01:33:04.240
And this is my favorite description of it from GameSpy's Raymond Padilla.

01:33:04.960 --> 01:33:07.840
Deep, devilishly enjoyable and unique.

01:33:08.400 --> 01:33:10.080
Devilishly enjoyable.

01:33:10.080 --> 01:33:11.400
I'm going to steal that one day.

01:33:12.040 --> 01:33:18.480
But let's go over just like with some of the other ratings were all game gave it a five out of five.

01:33:19.600 --> 01:33:21.000
Eurogamer, ten out of ten.

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:22.200
Gameformer, ten out of ten.

01:33:22.200 --> 01:33:25.360
Game Revolution, a GameSpot, nine point six out of ten.

01:33:25.720 --> 01:33:27.720
GameSpy, ninety five out of a hundred.

01:33:27.720 --> 01:33:29.520
IGN, nine point seven out of ten.

01:33:29.520 --> 01:33:32.880
So, I mean, really, really amazing.

01:33:33.200 --> 01:33:37.280
And it got a vehicle to ride that the last game didn't have.

01:33:37.280 --> 01:33:38.480
You can ride around on a motorcycle.

01:33:38.480 --> 01:33:41.960
You know, get your own wood rash on.

01:33:43.880 --> 01:33:50.280
But it's it's just the Windows version, even that came out in May 2003,

01:33:50.600 --> 01:33:55.200
and it was also highly acclaimed with its scores rivaling

01:33:55.400 --> 01:33:58.600
maybe just under the console version.

01:34:00.560 --> 01:34:03.880
They were, you know, it got really

01:34:04.840 --> 01:34:09.280
a lot of kudos for its improvement in the rendering, like improved draw distance

01:34:09.800 --> 01:34:13.480
and fewer texture issues

01:34:14.720 --> 01:34:17.760
and actually having very reasonable requirements.

01:34:18.280 --> 01:34:24.960
So Vice City was also released on mobile devices December 2012.

01:34:25.400 --> 01:34:26.960
It was mostly favorable.

01:34:26.960 --> 01:34:31.120
You know, a lot of the problems with it, it had actually enhanced visuals,

01:34:31.120 --> 01:34:33.120
but the problems with it were the touch screen controls.

01:34:34.800 --> 01:34:37.200
It was pretty, pretty well received overall.

01:34:38.400 --> 01:34:41.560
But yeah, the game has made so much money.

01:34:41.560 --> 01:34:44.560
And honestly, people are still all about it.

01:34:45.320 --> 01:34:47.320
But then, but then.

01:34:48.360 --> 01:34:51.520
There were a few controversies

01:34:51.520 --> 01:34:55.360
because you can't have a GTA game without, you know, controversies

01:34:55.360 --> 01:34:57.000
and Grand Theft Auto.

01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:02.040
No, I'm and the other reason I picked this one is

01:35:02.040 --> 01:35:04.920
I didn't want to deal with the fucking hot coffee thing.

01:35:06.960 --> 01:35:12.000
But anyway, part of, you know, people, of course,

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:16.600
there was the violence issue, the objectification,

01:35:16.760 --> 01:35:21.360
a lot of the ethnic stereotypes,

01:35:23.600 --> 01:35:28.480
you know, just like, you know, showing that people immigrated

01:35:28.480 --> 01:35:31.280
from a certain place were, you know,

01:35:32.320 --> 01:35:34.760
drug dealers or thugs or whatever.

01:35:36.960 --> 01:35:39.240
But, you know, and of course,

01:35:39.240 --> 01:35:43.920
and it was it was a mature game in Australia.

01:35:43.920 --> 01:35:48.120
It was actually edited a lot to get an M.A.

01:35:48.120 --> 01:35:50.760
15 plus classification.

01:35:50.760 --> 01:35:53.680
And then there was later on an uncensored version

01:35:53.680 --> 01:35:55.920
that came out over there that kept its classification.

01:35:57.400 --> 01:36:01.280
There was a six hundred million dollar lawsuit

01:36:01.280 --> 01:36:04.920
against Cody Posey, Rockstar Games, Take Two Interactive

01:36:05.240 --> 01:36:07.880
and Sony claiming that

01:36:09.760 --> 01:36:12.960
14 year old Cody Posey played the game obsessively

01:36:12.960 --> 01:36:15.680
before murdering his father, stepmother and step sister

01:36:16.280 --> 01:36:18.240
at a ranch in the Hondo, New Mexico.

01:36:20.280 --> 01:36:24.000
And they were also, though, blaming Zoloft.

01:36:24.480 --> 01:36:27.080
Just I take that I haven't killed anybody

01:36:28.360 --> 01:36:29.320
that I'll talk about.

01:36:29.320 --> 01:36:30.880
I'm kidding. Haven't. Haven't done it at all.

01:36:31.800 --> 01:36:34.320
But the case was dismissed in 2007

01:36:34.320 --> 01:36:38.720
as New Mexico had no jurisdiction for Sony or Take Two.

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:46.400
Another there were other cases out there, as in Jack Thompson.

01:36:48.760 --> 01:36:53.360
Not that name again, but it's been a few years.

01:36:54.480 --> 01:36:55.880
I feel like it's been a decade.

01:36:55.880 --> 01:36:59.400
He slid into obscurity some time ago and rightfully so.

01:37:00.400 --> 01:37:02.760
Yeah, but he he brought up

01:37:03.800 --> 01:37:08.760
a lawsuit about an eight year old named Devin Moore,

01:37:08.760 --> 01:37:12.400
who killed two Alabama police officers and a dispatcher

01:37:12.760 --> 01:37:15.720
before fleeing in a patrol car and was apprehended.

01:37:16.040 --> 01:37:18.280
And he was quoted saying, life is like a video game.

01:37:18.280 --> 01:37:19.800
Everyone's got to die sometime.

01:37:21.640 --> 01:37:26.840
But. Thompson removed himself from the case,

01:37:27.840 --> 01:37:30.760
actually, from a couple of cases that he had been involved in

01:37:30.760 --> 01:37:33.360
because of his unprofessional conduct.

01:37:34.520 --> 01:37:38.640
The Supreme Court rejected an appeal to and they dismissed the case

01:37:39.040 --> 01:37:42.800
and rejected the appeal by the defendants to dismiss the case.

01:37:44.160 --> 01:37:47.520
Moving on the psychic readers network.

01:37:48.520 --> 01:37:52.560
And they sued Rockstar over a character named Ante Pollay,

01:37:53.120 --> 01:37:55.760
which doesn't that mean chicken play?

01:37:56.240 --> 01:38:00.160
Anyway, saying that the characters between her and

01:38:02.240 --> 01:38:04.600
Yuri Harris, who voiced the character,

01:38:06.760 --> 01:38:09.800
that it was copyright infringement

01:38:09.800 --> 01:38:13.480
and that it was it was really just parody.

01:38:13.720 --> 01:38:16.440
So, yeah, there were

01:38:17.440 --> 01:38:20.120
its legacy has been pretty, pretty intense.

01:38:20.120 --> 01:38:23.520
You know, it's definitely raised the bar for for video games since then.

01:38:23.840 --> 01:38:26.440
Oh, gosh. Yeah, I think it was disbarred a while ago.

01:38:26.440 --> 01:38:29.360
I don't know. I didn't care enough about the about the loser to

01:38:30.040 --> 01:38:32.880
look into what happened to him.

01:38:32.880 --> 01:38:34.880
But it has had so many releases.

01:38:35.400 --> 01:38:38.840
So there for all the ports

01:38:39.280 --> 01:38:41.880
after the PS2 version, there was a Windows version.

01:38:43.640 --> 01:38:46.960
There was a GameCube version that was planned, but canceled.

01:38:47.320 --> 01:38:50.160
It was bundled with Grand Theft Auto three and a compilation

01:38:50.160 --> 01:38:52.840
titled Grand Theft Auto Double Pack on Xbox.

01:38:53.880 --> 01:38:57.720
The Xbox version also had a custom soundtrack

01:38:58.120 --> 01:39:00.920
and improved audio models, reflections.

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:04.600
And it also the double pack was also bundled with

01:39:04.600 --> 01:39:07.800
San Andreas compilation called Grand Theft Auto, the trilogy.

01:39:09.240 --> 01:39:14.960
The trilogy was also released for Mac OS X, November 12, 2010.

01:39:15.240 --> 01:39:17.320
It's OS X, not OS X people.

01:39:17.520 --> 01:39:19.840
X is a Roman numeral.

01:39:20.680 --> 01:39:25.440
It was also released on iOS and Android,

01:39:26.840 --> 01:39:29.480
following more of the Windows version of the game,

01:39:29.480 --> 01:39:32.120
but had enhanced visuals in the customized layout.

01:39:34.320 --> 01:39:36.480
There was also a Fire OS version,

01:39:36.480 --> 01:39:40.480
an emulated version of Vice City was playable on PS3.

01:39:41.440 --> 01:39:44.920
That was with the PlayStation Network's PS2 Classics.

01:39:45.200 --> 01:39:48.880
Another emulated version for PS4 upscaled to 1080p

01:39:49.120 --> 01:39:50.480
with PlayStation Trophies.

01:39:52.600 --> 01:39:57.600
There is a remastered version called the Definitive Edition

01:39:58.760 --> 01:40:03.120
that was released on Windows, Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox One,

01:40:03.120 --> 01:40:09.560
Xbox Series X slash S, more versions for Android and iOS in development.

01:40:12.040 --> 01:40:14.960
Another group reverse engineered the game

01:40:14.960 --> 01:40:17.960
and released it as an executable in 2020.

01:40:19.240 --> 01:40:25.400
It was called ReVC that lets you put it on Switch, Vita, Wii U.

01:40:26.240 --> 01:40:30.520
Take-Two issued a DMCA takedown on the project.

01:40:32.800 --> 01:40:36.880
But there's a lot more about just where it stands in legalities.

01:40:36.880 --> 01:40:40.320
You know, there are people then trying to reverse engineer it

01:40:40.320 --> 01:40:44.080
and put it everywhere and Take-Two is like, oh, no, no, no.

01:40:45.440 --> 01:40:47.120
Bad people, no.

01:40:47.120 --> 01:40:48.080
But that's it.

01:40:48.080 --> 01:40:51.600
I know there's a lot to cover on that one and I glossed over a bunch.

01:40:53.800 --> 01:40:57.240
If you're interested, though, there there's a really good

01:40:57.240 --> 01:40:58.400
I'd have to find it again.

01:40:58.400 --> 01:41:01.920
There's a really good documentary about the entire evolution

01:41:01.920 --> 01:41:06.760
of the Grand Theft Auto series down to every new version

01:41:06.760 --> 01:41:09.400
in the platform that it was on.

01:41:09.400 --> 01:41:13.720
And I highly recommend watching it if you're really interested in it.

01:41:14.400 --> 01:41:19.600
Um, Boz, there was no code for hot coffee and it wasn't even in this game,

01:41:19.600 --> 01:41:22.320
which is why I didn't do the game that the hot coffee was in.

01:41:25.240 --> 01:41:28.880
Because as part of this, which a great pick for Classic Game of the Week,

01:41:28.880 --> 01:41:31.280
obviously had to be done eventually,

01:41:31.280 --> 01:41:34.280
because it got brought up, I also was legitimately curious

01:41:34.280 --> 01:41:35.880
whatever happened to that bitch.

01:41:35.880 --> 01:41:41.440
So I went to the wiki for Jack Thompson to see whatever happened to that bitch.

01:41:41.720 --> 01:41:43.200
And yes, you all are right.

01:41:43.200 --> 01:41:44.040
He was disbarred.

01:41:44.040 --> 01:41:45.920
We, you know, we covered that a million times over.

01:41:46.160 --> 01:41:50.200
It's interesting because the it talks about his activities through about 2008,

01:41:50.200 --> 01:41:53.920
2009, and then there's nothing but a single sentence.

01:41:53.920 --> 01:41:59.280
And again, this is it's sourced, but it's yeah, it's sourced, but it's it's wiki.

01:41:59.280 --> 01:42:01.120
So, you know, whatever anybody could have written it.

01:42:01.400 --> 01:42:08.360
But in an April 2016 interview with Inverse, which is an online magazine,

01:42:08.880 --> 01:42:14.600
Thompson stated he was teaching civics classes to inmates in the Florida prison system,

01:42:14.880 --> 01:42:18.320
including an American history and constitutional law class

01:42:18.320 --> 01:42:20.600
at the Everglades Correctional Institution.

01:42:22.520 --> 01:42:23.080
So.

01:42:24.160 --> 01:42:25.800
As a fellow inmate or?

01:42:25.800 --> 01:42:26.960
No, no.

01:42:27.520 --> 01:42:28.040
Oh.

01:42:29.560 --> 01:42:31.240
So, oh, God.

01:42:31.240 --> 01:42:33.440
Did you see the section about Janet Reno?

01:42:33.440 --> 01:42:34.280
No, I didn't.

01:42:34.280 --> 01:42:36.440
I didn't want to read everything.

01:42:36.440 --> 01:42:37.160
I have to.

01:42:37.200 --> 01:42:38.200
This is great.

01:42:38.240 --> 01:42:38.640
OK.

01:42:39.880 --> 01:42:44.680
He met Janet Reno in 1975, applied for a job, but was not hired.

01:42:45.200 --> 01:42:45.760
He.

01:42:48.160 --> 01:42:49.240
He had.

01:42:50.720 --> 01:42:55.720
Sent her a letter to have her check a box to indicate whether she was homosexual,

01:42:55.720 --> 01:43:00.040
bisexual or heterosexual, and then she put a hand on his shoulder and responded,

01:43:00.280 --> 01:43:02.040
I'm only interested in virile men.

01:43:02.040 --> 01:43:03.320
That's why I'm not attracted to you.

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:07.840
I miss Janet Reno.

01:43:08.040 --> 01:43:12.000
Like the thing the thing I miss about Janet Reno most was that when Will Ferrer

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:14.720
would parody her on Saturday Night Live with the dance parties,

01:43:14.720 --> 01:43:18.640
not only was that whole thing really funny, but she came on and did one.

01:43:18.840 --> 01:43:21.080
And they had a laugh together.

01:43:21.080 --> 01:43:23.640
Like she was very like self-deprecating in that way.

01:43:23.640 --> 01:43:25.200
And, you know, that's it's great.

01:43:25.880 --> 01:43:32.280
And for anyone who only knows him about this, he was also the one responsible

01:43:32.280 --> 01:43:40.240
for the lawsuit against NWA, 2 Live Crew, all of that going on.

01:43:40.840 --> 01:43:42.760
Oh, that's how he got famous.

01:43:42.760 --> 01:43:44.480
I'm using my quotey fingers in the first place.

01:43:44.720 --> 01:43:46.520
He went around a bunch of rap.

01:43:46.520 --> 01:43:48.040
He went after a bunch of rap groups.

01:43:48.600 --> 01:43:54.440
He went after Ice-T for for that rather famous song of his and Madonna.

01:43:55.840 --> 01:43:57.120
So, yeah, whatever.

01:43:57.120 --> 01:43:57.720
Anyway.

01:43:57.720 --> 01:43:58.200
All right.

01:43:58.680 --> 01:43:59.040
All right.

01:43:59.040 --> 01:44:01.640
Well, there's your update on that one.

01:44:01.760 --> 01:44:02.200
All right.

01:44:02.200 --> 01:44:02.800
Moving on.

01:44:02.800 --> 01:44:06.960
Let's talk of the sickest of sick burns from Janet Reno.

01:44:06.960 --> 01:44:09.840
Let us not speak of his name again for another seven years.

01:44:09.840 --> 01:44:10.240
All right.

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:11.640
Moving on.

01:44:11.640 --> 01:44:15.560
Let's talk about some other things going on in the gaming industry, but we can do it quickly.

01:44:15.560 --> 01:44:16.840
Loki, rapid fire news.

01:44:17.480 --> 01:44:21.760
Yeah, as we talked about last week, there was a game that leaked out and now there's the official announcement.

01:44:21.760 --> 01:44:24.160
So it's Lego 2K Drive.

01:44:24.160 --> 01:44:26.320
It is an open world racing game.

01:44:26.320 --> 01:44:29.880
Kind of think of almost for maybe a little bit of Forza, but obviously not.

01:44:30.840 --> 01:44:34.720
But it is a Lego game and you drive and race around.

01:44:35.640 --> 01:44:38.000
Unfortunately, it is a 2K game.

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:41.120
And with that, there are season passes.

01:44:41.120 --> 01:44:43.880
There are in-game currencies.

01:44:43.880 --> 01:44:51.120
There are monetization's and there are seventy dollar price tags, assuming you buy the base game.

01:44:51.120 --> 01:44:57.560
In which case, then also it could be upwards to ninety nine or even more than that for the game.

01:44:57.560 --> 01:45:03.200
So. That's probably a pass for me, even though it does look cool, but like.

01:45:04.400 --> 01:45:05.800
No, no.

01:45:08.160 --> 01:45:13.480
And then, of course, you know, continuing on with their cereal domination,

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:17.560
Minecraft is doing yet another cereal this time.

01:45:17.560 --> 01:45:21.440
They are doing Minecraft flavored Frosted Flakes, I guess.

01:45:21.440 --> 01:45:24.640
It basically has marshmallows in it and their square marshmallows.

01:45:25.360 --> 01:45:29.600
It's better than their first cereal to ruin cereals by putting in gross marshmallows.

01:45:29.960 --> 01:45:36.080
I mean, yeah, well, they're their original Minecraft cereal that they have and my kids have had.

01:45:36.320 --> 01:45:43.280
It was like cinnamon cereal, but like not cinnamon sugar is like cinnamon with marshmallows.

01:45:43.680 --> 01:45:47.600
So I'll take Frosted Flakes with marshmallows over cinnamon with marshmallows.

01:45:47.600 --> 01:45:50.320
I don't know why they keep doing cinnamon, like stop doing cinnamon.

01:45:50.320 --> 01:45:54.800
I also cannot stand the concept of marshmallows and cereal because I don't.

01:45:54.800 --> 01:45:57.560
OK, because I'm the weirdo. I don't like my cereal and milk.

01:45:57.560 --> 01:45:59.240
I like to just eat cereal.

01:45:59.240 --> 01:46:05.040
But the marshmallows that they put in cereal is meant to be put in milk to actually become full marshmallow.

01:46:05.880 --> 01:46:07.440
But there's gross anyway.

01:46:07.440 --> 01:46:09.880
Marshmallows are gross, but these are the gross of the gross.

01:46:09.880 --> 01:46:11.880
Yeah, but the licorice of marshmallows.

01:46:11.880 --> 01:46:13.680
I love the dehydrated marshmallows.

01:46:13.680 --> 01:46:16.800
I love I love Lucky Charms because like you chew into the marshmallow.

01:46:16.800 --> 01:46:18.760
It's kind of like chewing on an eraser.

01:46:18.760 --> 01:46:20.200
It's just great. I love it.

01:46:21.200 --> 01:46:26.280
I could. And now keep in mind, I was I was the kid that liked Grape Nuts.

01:46:27.040 --> 01:46:30.360
Yeah, I'm like, I like Frosted Mini Wheats.

01:46:30.360 --> 01:46:32.720
That's that's my favorite.

01:46:32.720 --> 01:46:33.880
You know what? You know what?

01:46:33.880 --> 01:46:38.760
My cereal, so like I'm on both sides of the spectrum with cereals there.

01:46:38.760 --> 01:46:44.040
So like it's either like Captain Crunch or Total.

01:46:44.880 --> 01:46:45.720
I love Total.

01:46:45.720 --> 01:46:46.680
See, here's the thing.

01:46:46.680 --> 01:46:50.720
A diabetes diagnosis will change your perspective on cereal significantly.

01:46:50.720 --> 01:46:53.560
I don't I can't there's an interesting brand.

01:46:53.560 --> 01:46:57.240
I'm not going to name it because they pay a lot of money for advertising on social media.

01:46:57.240 --> 01:47:03.680
But there's there is a brand that is trying to make low carb cereal and they actually sell it at Target now.

01:47:03.680 --> 01:47:06.120
And I've had it and it's it's OK.

01:47:06.960 --> 01:47:08.600
But it's all about portion.

01:47:08.600 --> 01:47:09.360
You haven't heard of it?

01:47:09.920 --> 01:47:11.240
No, I'll text you.

01:47:11.760 --> 01:47:13.320
I have Turbo. I don't watch ads.

01:47:13.720 --> 01:47:17.440
Oh, no, no, it's it's oh, you don't you don't read Facebook, it's Facebook ads.

01:47:17.680 --> 01:47:22.760
So Facebook, Facebook, I've completely divorced myself from the entire Facebook universe.

01:47:23.920 --> 01:47:27.240
Jealous, but it's easy.

01:47:27.240 --> 01:47:29.080
Just don't do it. Yeah.

01:47:29.080 --> 01:47:32.040
So but yeah.

01:47:32.360 --> 01:47:34.560
So there's there's a very popular brand.

01:47:34.840 --> 01:47:36.800
Yes. Deft said it in chat.

01:47:36.800 --> 01:47:40.120
That's as much as I'll give you for the podcast for the podcast.

01:47:40.360 --> 01:47:43.080
All right. But it's it's OK.

01:47:43.360 --> 01:47:50.240
But you can kind of tell that you're eating something that's like, I can't believe it's not cereal.

01:47:50.600 --> 01:47:55.400
Like it's like it's very it's it's the margarine of cereals.

01:47:55.600 --> 01:47:56.400
It really is.

01:47:57.080 --> 01:47:57.440
All right.

01:47:57.440 --> 01:48:03.200
And Bobby, just just as an FYI, the rest of my family is on Facebook.

01:48:03.320 --> 01:48:04.840
I'm still not going on there.

01:48:04.840 --> 01:48:06.680
If they want to talk to me, they can message me.

01:48:09.080 --> 01:48:10.680
Family, who talks to them?

01:48:10.720 --> 01:48:11.760
All right. I'm just kidding.

01:48:12.280 --> 01:48:13.880
I talk to my dad as much as I can.

01:48:14.360 --> 01:48:19.960
All right. Moving on, let's move on and oh, we still have actually I'm sorry, some stories here.

01:48:19.960 --> 01:48:21.160
Let's go to Dark Sakura.

01:48:21.160 --> 01:48:22.880
Oh, this is another interesting collaboration.

01:48:22.880 --> 01:48:24.560
I love this. Yeah.

01:48:24.560 --> 01:48:32.240
And I kind of don't know what to think, except I need to just like go buy a bunch of this and then have a place that has an accessible bathtub.

01:48:33.800 --> 01:48:35.880
But they are selling.

01:48:36.120 --> 01:48:40.520
Lush has a collaboration with the Super Mario Brothers movie.

01:48:40.920 --> 01:48:48.320
And they have a series of bath soaps to, quote, power up your bathing.

01:48:48.920 --> 01:48:59.240
There's a cola scented Mario shower gel, apple for Luigi, a warm and spicy Bowser shower jelly and a peach shower jelly.

01:49:00.160 --> 01:49:02.000
So, yay.

01:49:03.120 --> 01:49:06.600
But the thing that I care about is the question block bath bomb.

01:49:06.880 --> 01:49:10.720
And I am going to quote the article here because they did miss a freaking opportunity.

01:49:10.960 --> 01:49:12.640
They should have called it a bath bomb.

01:49:14.480 --> 01:49:17.480
Oh, they should have called it a bath bomb, I love that.

01:49:19.160 --> 01:49:32.800
But at any rate, you drop the question block into your bath and you get a super power toy, a coin, you get a fire flower or, you know, a star or, you know, one up or something.

01:49:32.800 --> 01:49:40.640
And like, I'm not going to lie, I got some of the Hello Kitty ones for the same thing.

01:49:41.760 --> 01:49:44.120
So I would do this.

01:49:45.840 --> 01:49:47.280
It just depends on what it smells like.

01:49:47.320 --> 01:49:52.240
I am like ridiculously sensitive to some smells.

01:49:52.440 --> 01:50:00.680
I like Lush, but I get like, I kind of feel high when I'm in there too long, like overstimulated.

01:50:00.680 --> 01:50:02.560
It is an overpowering, yeah.

01:50:03.360 --> 01:50:10.640
And also, I still have the same chocolate lotion bar that I bought five years ago.

01:50:12.080 --> 01:50:14.480
I've almost used it up, but I still have it.

01:50:17.280 --> 01:50:21.920
I actually, it's one of those things where it's like, I love me a bubble bath.

01:50:21.920 --> 01:50:26.840
I do, especially now that Alan and I have a house with a tub that lends itself to being able to do that.

01:50:26.840 --> 01:50:29.480
Like, I'm going to have to go to Lush.

01:50:29.480 --> 01:50:41.000
And that's one of those places where you walk in there and those hounds that work there will upsell you, upsell you.

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:43.720
They're so, so good at that stuff.

01:50:43.760 --> 01:50:48.800
Like, I'll go into Lush and like $100 later, I'll be like, why did I buy all this shit?

01:50:49.440 --> 01:50:51.880
But anyway, but I do love me a bubble bath.

01:50:52.320 --> 01:50:55.880
So, all right, moving on.

01:50:56.320 --> 01:50:57.440
Let's talk about...

01:50:58.440 --> 01:51:00.280
Body washes soap.

01:51:02.520 --> 01:51:02.840
Yeah.

01:51:02.840 --> 01:51:04.200
Just saying it's for a tiger claw.

01:51:04.520 --> 01:51:05.120
It doesn't.

01:51:05.520 --> 01:51:05.920
Yeah.

01:51:06.600 --> 01:51:09.440
I don't even know, what did Lush pull on YouTube?

01:51:09.440 --> 01:51:10.400
I didn't know about a thing like that.

01:51:10.400 --> 01:51:12.760
I didn't know about something that they did on YouTube.

01:51:12.760 --> 01:51:13.440
So...

01:51:13.680 --> 01:51:16.560
Well, let me read this while I wait for elaboration on that.

01:51:17.080 --> 01:51:20.400
Let's talk about the Bloodstained Curse of the Moon Chronicles.

01:51:20.400 --> 01:51:23.480
There is a physical switch bundle that is being announced for Japan.

01:51:23.720 --> 01:51:28.920
And that is going to come out with an art book, a two-disc soundtrack CD and an acrylic keychain.

01:51:29.200 --> 01:51:33.040
It's being released on July 13th for 4180.

01:51:33.040 --> 01:51:36.880
I'm sorry, the regular edition is 4180 yen.

01:51:37.080 --> 01:51:42.360
The premium limited edition, 9980 yen for that.

01:51:42.360 --> 01:51:48.040
And again, this is for Bloodstained Curse of the Moon, which basically if you're a Castlevania fan, this is all you have now.

01:51:48.560 --> 01:51:51.520
So, some people may be interested in that.

01:51:52.520 --> 01:51:59.280
All righty, Fixation Gay says, Lush bought a URL that a small creator was using and YouTube basically let them steal it.

01:51:59.280 --> 01:52:06.640
Oh, you know, we had brought up that site Kick earlier, and I heard a similar thing happened over there, which is not a good look for them.

01:52:06.640 --> 01:52:10.800
And that was actually the whole thing that made me go think, oh, I should go state claim to my name over there now.

01:52:11.040 --> 01:52:13.280
Not that it's going to matter, but I don't think there's a...

01:52:13.280 --> 01:52:16.720
Why do you think I have never let go of DarkSakurai.com?

01:52:16.720 --> 01:52:17.520
Oh, I don't believe you.

01:52:17.920 --> 01:52:26.080
I don't think there's a lot of people using the name Rob Roberts, but I know there's a politician in the UK who is apparently an arsehole, from what I understand.

01:52:27.360 --> 01:52:29.640
But I don't know much about him.

01:52:29.640 --> 01:52:32.200
But apparently there's a politician over there who's got a lot of troubles.

01:52:32.680 --> 01:52:34.520
I share my stage name with a porn star.

01:52:35.800 --> 01:52:38.360
Well, and the Bionic Woman, for God's sake.

01:52:38.360 --> 01:52:42.160
No, no, no, I spell mine differently than the Bionic Woman, remember?

01:52:42.160 --> 01:52:44.840
No, OK. Oh, you mean down to the spelling.

01:52:45.240 --> 01:52:55.400
Yeah, down to the spelling, because because the Bionic Woman is J-A-I-M-E-S-O-M-M-E-R-S and mine is J-A-M-I-E.

01:52:55.640 --> 01:52:57.800
I get pissed off when people misspell my name out here.

01:52:57.800 --> 01:53:04.680
I'm looking at you, everybody ever at Starbucks and S-U-M-M-E-R-S.

01:53:04.760 --> 01:53:06.280
So, so, yeah.

01:53:06.760 --> 01:53:12.120
Um. Although, Rob, you remember this, Jessica's ex.

01:53:13.280 --> 01:53:19.560
Yeah, and I had the same name down to last name, and we got each other's mail

01:53:20.640 --> 01:53:27.840
and I still got his mail years after they were they were broken up until I got married.

01:53:27.880 --> 01:53:33.360
Yeah. I'm not saying what my old name was.

01:53:33.360 --> 01:53:36.440
Of course not. The concept of a maiden name is disgusting.

01:53:37.920 --> 01:53:45.360
All right. Let's move on and try to check out some releases, things that will be coming out a little sooner than the Curse of the Moon Chronicles bundle.

01:53:45.880 --> 01:53:48.480
World release date starting in the U.S., Loki.

01:53:49.320 --> 01:53:56.000
Yeah, we have Nine Years of Shadows on PC and Crime Boss, Rock K.

01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:57.120
City. That's awesome.

01:53:57.120 --> 01:54:00.520
Can't wait to play that. That'll be coming out this week as well.

01:54:00.840 --> 01:54:10.360
Last of Us Part One on PC, MLB The Show 23 on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series.

01:54:10.880 --> 01:54:13.640
Sifu on Xbox One and Xbox Series.

01:54:14.040 --> 01:54:19.880
Dredge on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series.

01:54:20.400 --> 01:54:23.200
The Great War Western Front on PC.

01:54:23.680 --> 01:54:31.440
Raven Bound on PC, Saga of Sins on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series.

01:54:31.880 --> 01:54:38.080
Blade Assault on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series.

01:54:38.120 --> 01:54:38.680
That is it.

01:54:39.840 --> 01:54:50.640
All right. Going over to Japan on the 30th of March on the Nintendo Switch, we have Serial Cleaners is coming out.

01:54:51.400 --> 01:54:52.960
Is this a game? What I think it is.

01:54:52.960 --> 01:55:04.040
Oh, no, I literally thought this is going to be a game about cleaning, like Powerwash Simulator, but like next level, like for people who just can't get enough, never be clean.

01:55:04.320 --> 01:55:05.360
I thought it would be that.

01:55:05.360 --> 01:55:06.960
Speaking of Serial Mom.

01:55:06.960 --> 01:55:09.240
No, sadly, it is nothing like that.

01:55:09.240 --> 01:55:19.680
It is about, it says straight out of 90s, but it's getting rid of bodies, making the place spotless and don't get caught.

01:55:19.920 --> 01:55:28.240
You alternate between four characters with a unique skill set, and it's set in the era of 90s cult movies.

01:55:28.280 --> 01:55:29.560
So I guess that is interesting.

01:55:29.560 --> 01:55:32.000
You're cleaning up crime scenes.

01:55:32.280 --> 01:55:35.200
I guess that is kind of an interesting concept for a game.

01:55:35.200 --> 01:55:37.080
So that is out on the Switch this week.

01:55:37.640 --> 01:55:40.400
Also, Tales of the Neon Sea also out this week.

01:55:40.600 --> 01:55:42.160
Winning post 10.

01:55:42.720 --> 01:55:44.720
That's right. Winning post series.

01:55:44.720 --> 01:55:45.600
It's still going.

01:55:45.600 --> 01:55:48.560
And Koei Tecmo is putting out the 10th version in Japan this week.

01:55:49.560 --> 01:55:51.160
That is all on the Switch.

01:55:51.440 --> 01:56:00.880
Also in Japan on the PlayStation 5 this week, The Chant, as well as Tales of the Neon Sea, winning post 10, not skipping the PlayStation.

01:56:00.880 --> 01:56:02.560
So it's out there as well.

01:56:03.280 --> 01:56:04.960
Let's move over to the UK.

01:56:04.960 --> 01:56:05.560
Dark Sakura.

01:56:06.400 --> 01:56:07.360
Bare handful.

01:56:07.760 --> 01:56:12.240
On the 28th on Switch, we have Session Skatesim.

01:56:13.280 --> 01:56:15.280
Also, actually, all of these are on the 30th.

01:56:15.280 --> 01:56:17.560
Also on Switch, we have Ravensburger Memory.

01:56:19.120 --> 01:56:25.320
Dredge for PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch, not to be confused with The Dredge, most annoying killer ever.

01:56:25.320 --> 01:56:26.000
Well, one of them.

01:56:26.440 --> 01:56:32.320
And then also on the 30th, we have Sifu, Vengeance Edition for Xbox.

01:56:34.480 --> 01:56:41.560
All right, we have a few more stories for you, and then we have the mailbag as well as your calls, if we have any tonight.

01:56:42.560 --> 01:56:43.840
vognetwork.com.

01:56:43.840 --> 01:56:48.160
That's vognetwork.com slash Discord is how to join our Discord server.

01:56:48.960 --> 01:56:49.720
Let's move on.

01:56:49.720 --> 01:56:51.080
We have some more stories.

01:56:51.080 --> 01:56:52.720
So let's go over to Loki.

01:56:53.800 --> 01:56:55.720
Oh, yes, I'm so excited.

01:56:55.760 --> 01:57:01.200
The news that Ubisoft is going to use AI to help them write dialogue.

01:57:01.600 --> 01:57:02.520
That's great.

01:57:03.360 --> 01:57:04.600
We know how that goes.

01:57:04.640 --> 01:57:10.840
Can the AI help them write, make better games that aren't all derivative of the Far Cry?

01:57:11.320 --> 01:57:14.480
The AI can run companies more effectively, it turns out.

01:57:17.200 --> 01:57:19.280
They've developed a tool called Ghostwriter.

01:57:19.320 --> 01:57:34.440
It says, introducing Ubisoft Ghostwriter, an AI tool developed in-house that aims to support our scriptwriters by generating the first draft of our NPC barks and phrases or sounds made by NPCs when players interact with them in the game world.

01:57:34.920 --> 01:57:43.360
It says the tool was created hand in hand with scriptwriters to create more realistic NPC interactions by generating variations on pieces of dialogue.

01:57:43.920 --> 01:57:49.640
And yeah, neat, I guess.

01:57:53.920 --> 01:57:55.080
I don't know, like,

01:57:55.080 --> 01:58:13.960
Ubisoft of all companies, you know, really hearing that some of the work is being tasked to AI, like, I just, I feel that like, their games already feel like they're generated by AI, like, let alone, you know, actually using AI for stuff.

01:58:13.960 --> 01:58:21.000
I understand that this is kind of, you know, to save some time, but not a great look.

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:31.240
Can the AI solve the problem of, you know, the rampant sexual harassment that's going on in the company? Can Ghostwriter take care of that too?

01:58:32.600 --> 01:58:40.040
As I said earlier in the show, the AI can make a better CEO for the company than Bobby Kotick.

01:58:41.040 --> 01:58:47.520
Let me actually so while you were saying that I actually just threw this into the Google bard thingy thing.

01:58:47.520 --> 01:58:55.600
So let me show that and by the way, why is it now? It didn't used to do this. But when I try to set up b roll on my other monitor, it makes your guys's squares gray.

01:58:55.600 --> 01:59:03.920
It didn't used to do that. I have to figure out what's going on behind the scenes. So sorry about that. But I just said I said, Okay, make up a new killer for the game Dead by Daylight.

01:59:04.400 --> 01:59:13.000
And it says, here's a new killer that I'm not going to read the whole thing, but it came up with a killer called the puppeteer. The puppeteer can control the movements of other survivors by using a special puppet.

01:59:13.200 --> 01:59:19.480
The puppet can be used to attack survivors, block them from escape routes, or even force them to self sabotage. Okay, this all sounds fine and good.

01:59:19.520 --> 01:59:22.120
The what? The bellmaster from VHS?

01:59:22.120 --> 01:59:35.280
This clearly was stolen from a fan thing or another game even like you're suggesting from somewhere. Right? That's that's the whole thing where like this-

01:59:35.280 --> 01:59:36.920
Orange, right, we already have the pig.

01:59:37.400 --> 01:59:47.120
This AI thing is kind of going, right? And fixation gaze says, yeah, that's someone's idea, right? And and I realized the usage of the term AI is a little bit nuanced.

01:59:47.120 --> 02:00:02.880
I'm using that here because that is what the industry and most, you know, commentators are saying right now. I realize, you know, some may say this is like machine learning, or this is just this is just really let me Google that for you to the next level because it's using a lot of predictive stuff to do this.

02:00:03.080 --> 02:00:11.440
But my point is, a lot of what just came up in that little thing about make up a new killer that was stolen from somewhere. I guarantee it.

02:00:11.440 --> 02:00:19.560
Yeah, from Reddit, because I just searched Dead by Daylight Puppeteer. And there's someone that there in this big old thing.

02:00:19.560 --> 02:00:27.600
An AI cannot create its own answer without having learned it from other sources. That is the essence of machine learning.

02:00:28.040 --> 02:00:29.360
Exactly, exactly.

02:00:29.960 --> 02:00:36.520
So, I'll, yeah, I mean, I've taken a few courses on machine learning lately.

02:00:37.640 --> 02:00:47.520
The, for anyone who's saying, oh, it's going to be able to make these logical decisions and everything, all of its decisions are going to be based by the input of whatever goes into its database.

02:00:49.280 --> 02:00:51.800
I mean, some of the stuff that they've seen, and not necessarily-

02:00:51.800 --> 02:00:53.320
This isn't Detroit, y'all.

02:00:53.640 --> 02:01:06.480
But like GPT-4, whatever, they've been doing a hustle GPT, where they basically feed in like, okay, hey, you have $100 to spend, you know, we're going to start a business that's going to make as much money as possible.

02:01:06.520 --> 02:01:13.200
You tell me what to do, and I'll do it. And then it'll basically walk you through the whole process of doing everything.

02:01:16.360 --> 02:01:17.040
I'm going to see-

02:01:17.160 --> 02:01:18.600
Actually making money with it, too.

02:01:19.560 --> 02:01:24.200
I did this earlier and I got an answer and I have to share it here because you guys will get a kick out of this.

02:01:24.200 --> 02:01:31.280
Okay, here we go. So I asked Bard, what is the longest running video game podcast?

02:01:32.200 --> 02:01:39.640
And it told me the longest running video game podcast is another show, which has been running since 2002.

02:01:39.640 --> 02:01:44.720
It's a weekly radio show that is broadcast live on the internet and is also available as a podcast.

02:01:44.720 --> 02:01:48.400
This particular show also started on the radio somewhere.

02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:52.840
And I actually, I'm not sure that's the year they actually started.

02:01:52.840 --> 02:01:54.520
I have to go look it up or whatever.

02:01:54.760 --> 02:01:59.840
But if you didn't know, this show has been running since June 23rd, 2002.

02:01:59.840 --> 02:02:05.600
And we're pretty confident we're the longest running video game podcast, weekly, uninterrupted at this point.

02:02:06.440 --> 02:02:11.960
So, and I like if this had come up and said gamer tag radio-

02:02:11.960 --> 02:02:12.760
Except for Star Trek Cruises?

02:02:13.040 --> 02:02:13.560
What's that?

02:02:14.080 --> 02:02:14.760
Except for Star Trek Cruises?

02:02:14.760 --> 02:02:16.120
Well, yeah, uninterrupted.

02:02:16.720 --> 02:02:19.360
Every show gets, people take Christmas and New Year's off.

02:02:19.480 --> 02:02:28.760
Anyway, if this had come up and said gamer tag radio, at least I would have understood that one because, you know, he puts out multiple episodes a week and he crossed 1000 episodes some time ago.

02:02:28.760 --> 02:02:33.120
So I would have at least kind of got like, it's kind of your perception of what is longest to me.

02:02:33.120 --> 02:02:35.200
It started in 2006.

02:02:35.400 --> 02:02:37.360
We are the longest chronologically running.

02:02:37.360 --> 02:02:42.120
So it's not even correct on the year that they started, which no disrespect to this show.

02:02:42.160 --> 02:02:43.320
They work very hard.

02:02:43.320 --> 02:02:45.120
This is not about us versus them.

02:02:45.120 --> 02:02:53.080
This is just about, we're very proud of the long legacy that this show has created and the fact that people still don't know about it.

02:02:53.320 --> 02:02:57.720
And like, you know, we're somehow that cool indie band, 21 years after the fact.

02:02:57.720 --> 02:02:58.960
We're very proud of that.

02:02:58.960 --> 02:03:08.240
And so I just, I get irritated because actually, if you go in and you look at some of the, one of them, like one of the suggestions even said they're the Guinness World Record holder.

02:03:08.400 --> 02:03:10.800
And that's what I went, hold up.

02:03:10.920 --> 02:03:12.840
But I actually couldn't find anything to source that.

02:03:13.160 --> 02:03:14.760
Yeah, Bard made that shit up.

02:03:14.760 --> 02:03:16.120
I tried to apply.

02:03:16.160 --> 02:03:16.640
I do.

02:03:16.640 --> 02:03:17.080
I do.

02:03:17.080 --> 02:03:19.080
That's why I went, hold the fuck up.

02:03:19.120 --> 02:03:20.520
That's exactly why I did that.

02:03:20.760 --> 02:03:21.040
Right.

02:03:21.760 --> 02:03:23.400
We have to apply as a company, by the way.

02:03:23.400 --> 02:03:23.720
Yeah.

02:03:24.360 --> 02:03:30.120
So yeah, if you search for one life left, it says, I was trying to do a call out post Loki.

02:03:31.080 --> 02:03:31.800
I don't care.

02:03:31.800 --> 02:03:32.160
Whatever.

02:03:32.480 --> 02:03:41.360
Uh, even say it's the world's longest, the world's longest running video game podcast, which is false.

02:03:42.240 --> 02:03:44.000
So yeah, it's,

02:03:44.240 --> 02:03:48.480
I want to be, I want to be clear because I don't, I don't want a silly war starting because we're all in it together.

02:03:48.480 --> 02:03:49.520
We're all podcasties.

02:03:49.760 --> 02:03:51.720
This is not an us versus them thing.

02:03:51.720 --> 02:03:59.480
This is just an AI doesn't get the facts right because it can't be nuanced enough sometimes.

02:03:59.960 --> 02:04:01.720
So it's, that's what it is.

02:04:01.760 --> 02:04:13.400
So anyway, but so the whole MPC dialogue and my point I was trying to make was that sure it can, and I realized they're not going to be using literally Google Bard or chat, GBT or whatever, but whatever it is they're using.

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:21.240
You know, I guess if it trains off of Ubisoft games, then whatever, whatever, but it's, it's all going to sound like a copy of something else.

02:04:24.400 --> 02:04:28.000
Now, granted, some of you feel that video game quest text is already at that point.

02:04:28.640 --> 02:04:29.920
Oh, oh, Rob.

02:04:30.160 --> 02:04:30.720
What's that?

02:04:31.520 --> 02:04:37.200
I'm sorry, this, I'm not meaning to set this off, but there's something that went back to a very earlier thing that we talked about.

02:04:37.240 --> 02:04:37.760
Okay.

02:04:38.760 --> 02:04:45.840
Um, on the homepage of Twitch now, I think this is, this is on the German page.

02:04:45.840 --> 02:04:49.360
Anyway, there is a Luna link right at the top of the page.

02:04:50.400 --> 02:05:03.760
They're, they have Luna at the bar on the top, but that's like, like throwing a link is literally the, the most minimal thing they could do.

02:05:04.400 --> 02:05:05.560
You don't even notice it.

02:05:06.480 --> 02:05:06.720
Yeah.

02:05:06.760 --> 02:05:10.080
And actually, yes, that says quite a, quite enough right there.

02:05:10.480 --> 02:05:11.360
You've never noticed it.

02:05:11.360 --> 02:05:12.280
With that I don't go to the homepage.

02:05:12.320 --> 02:05:13.600
I just go to my follower page.

02:05:13.600 --> 02:05:14.080
Fair.

02:05:15.440 --> 02:05:16.000
Interesting.

02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:18.920
I do go to the homepage, but then I instantly click things on the left.

02:05:18.960 --> 02:05:21.520
So I guess I never think to go to my followers page directly.

02:05:22.040 --> 02:05:22.560
It's interesting.

02:05:23.040 --> 02:05:23.400
Anyway.

02:05:24.400 --> 02:05:25.560
Uh, all right, let's move on.

02:05:25.560 --> 02:05:26.600
We still have a few more stories.

02:05:26.600 --> 02:05:27.200
Dark Sakura.

02:05:28.280 --> 02:05:31.760
Um, so Silent Hill 2 remake.

02:05:32.640 --> 02:05:35.640
Um, it is near completion according to the Bloober team.

02:05:36.120 --> 02:05:44.520
Um, they don't have a launch date yet, but they are revealing that it will be quote sooner rather than later.

02:05:45.120 --> 02:05:51.840
Um, according to a Polish outlet called Bankier, um, they said the game is technically ready.

02:05:51.880 --> 02:05:55.360
Um, but they're, it's not complete.

02:05:55.880 --> 02:05:57.400
It's close to completion.

02:05:57.440 --> 02:06:03.640
Um, and that the release schedule and promotional marketing is actually going out by Konami themselves.

02:06:04.280 --> 02:06:06.280
Um, so that's out of their hands.

02:06:06.760 --> 02:06:12.480
Um, but yeah, the, um, I'm pretty excited.

02:06:12.480 --> 02:06:17.480
They also are saying that the nurse enemies are now have black stockings.

02:06:18.360 --> 02:06:26.040
And according to, uh, Ito, the art director, um, it, it was because the original nurses exposed too much skin.

02:06:26.720 --> 02:06:26.960
Hmm.

02:06:27.560 --> 02:06:36.360
But, um, a lot of the fans are saying that this goes more with James Sunderland's, uh, psychosexual mental state.

02:06:36.760 --> 02:06:41.640
So, but you can, you can already wishlist it on steam.

02:06:41.640 --> 02:06:42.680
So I think that's pretty cool.

02:06:42.920 --> 02:06:43.280
Yeah.

02:06:43.360 --> 02:06:55.800
I wonder if, um, whatever is coming for E3, which by the way, not to get too much on a tangent, but I'm going to, cause I was ready to come on this show and be like, so Hey folks, we're like less than three months from E3.

02:06:56.040 --> 02:06:58.600
Um, are what the fuck is happening?

02:06:58.800 --> 02:07:05.440
Apparently E3 registration did open up at some point to like me and they are supposedly targeting podcasters.

02:07:05.800 --> 02:07:08.720
I almost wanted to apply just for the lols.

02:07:08.760 --> 02:07:12.800
Like I have no intention on going just because I don't have the time off to do it.

02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:14.960
I mean, I do, but I don't.

02:07:15.360 --> 02:07:20.400
Um, so it's, I almost want to apply for those, but, um, if one of you want to apply, go for it.

02:07:20.400 --> 02:07:20.920
I don't care.

02:07:20.920 --> 02:07:21.680
But, uh,

02:07:22.680 --> 02:07:25.520
does that mean I have to do like another writing sample?

02:07:25.520 --> 02:07:27.640
Jamie just said everything with her face.

02:07:27.640 --> 02:07:29.600
No, the application is completely different now.

02:07:29.680 --> 02:07:31.360
So they've, they've changed that.

02:07:31.360 --> 02:07:32.760
So for better or for worse, we'll see.

02:07:32.760 --> 02:07:33.200
When is it again?

02:07:33.840 --> 02:07:34.800
Middle of June.

02:07:36.240 --> 02:07:37.280
I know that's so descriptive.

02:07:37.280 --> 02:07:37.800
I'm sorry.

02:07:37.840 --> 02:07:38.600
Like maybe.

02:07:38.600 --> 02:07:43.160
Well, no, no, because, um, I took the week off for my birthday.

02:07:43.720 --> 02:07:46.560
Um, and then I'm going to TwitchCon.

02:07:46.600 --> 02:07:47.160
So,

02:07:47.320 --> 02:07:47.640
Oh yeah.

02:07:47.640 --> 02:07:50.600
I was just saying, no, your birthday is way too early and TwitchCon is too late.

02:07:50.800 --> 02:07:52.240
It's middle of June somewhere.

02:07:52.440 --> 02:07:53.600
I'm not going to be able to swing it.

02:07:54.080 --> 02:07:58.000
I would have done it just for shits and then going to, and then to go to Disneyland.

02:07:58.120 --> 02:07:58.480
Yeah.

02:07:58.480 --> 02:08:06.280
I got to admit, I'm still, I'm still a little bit tempted, but anyway, long story, but they, I have not seen E3 open up to general public.

02:08:07.560 --> 02:08:14.640
Now, I guess I should go to the website cause I, I don't, I would hate to sit here and, you know, I, if I'm, if I'm going to be critical, I want to be accurate.

02:08:14.640 --> 02:08:15.040
Okay.

02:08:15.440 --> 02:08:22.400
So I guess I could look here live on air, but I don't think the, uh, general registration is still open.

02:08:22.520 --> 02:08:29.000
I think industry and media and that whole thing is open, but not the general population is still not open.

02:08:29.280 --> 02:08:33.880
But folks, it is less than three months from E3.

02:08:34.120 --> 02:08:40.800
If you want to get a flight to Los Angeles, 90 days is the sweet spot to do it.

02:08:40.800 --> 02:08:44.280
There it is.

02:08:44.320 --> 02:08:44.520
Okay.

02:08:44.520 --> 02:08:44.920
Thank you.

02:08:44.960 --> 02:08:45.560
Thank you, Bobby.

02:08:45.560 --> 02:08:46.360
I knew somebody in chat.

02:08:46.520 --> 02:08:47.400
Not open yet.

02:08:47.400 --> 02:08:49.840
Gamer registration page says coming soon.

02:08:51.440 --> 02:08:52.320
Sure.

02:08:53.520 --> 02:08:54.360
Is it though?

02:08:54.360 --> 02:08:55.800
No shit about E3 anymore.

02:08:55.800 --> 02:08:56.840
It is not relevant.

02:08:57.520 --> 02:08:58.000
I know.

02:08:58.440 --> 02:08:59.160
End of story.

02:08:59.200 --> 02:08:59.520
I know.

02:08:59.520 --> 02:09:04.040
But I just, when, when the press release finally comes out that says, oh, we had to cancel E3.

02:09:04.160 --> 02:09:06.280
I just want to be able to say, mm hmm.

02:09:07.520 --> 02:09:10.440
I wouldn't, I would go to see if I can get a Sega t-shirt.

02:09:11.280 --> 02:09:13.720
And then go to Disneyland in my Sega t-shirt.

02:09:13.720 --> 02:09:16.680
I would go to take sad selfies in front of the NFT booths.

02:09:16.720 --> 02:09:17.760
That's what I would go for.

02:09:18.760 --> 02:09:22.320
And, and maybe see what sort of vaporware we're looking at again.

02:09:22.320 --> 02:09:23.360
I remember the Phantom.

02:09:25.160 --> 02:09:25.520
All right.

02:09:25.520 --> 02:09:28.000
You guys in chat are cracking me up.

02:09:28.240 --> 02:09:30.800
SSU100Matt says the ball pit will be fantastic.

02:09:31.040 --> 02:09:32.720
Fire Festival E3.

02:09:34.880 --> 02:09:35.800
Make it deep enough.

02:09:35.800 --> 02:09:38.840
I wonder if I, Rob, I wonder if I would run into Kojima again.

02:09:39.320 --> 02:09:39.800
Like I did.

02:09:39.800 --> 02:09:40.600
Why would he go?

02:09:41.080 --> 02:09:42.040
Why would he go?

02:09:43.720 --> 02:09:44.440
It's a joke.

02:09:44.440 --> 02:09:44.680
It is.

02:09:44.680 --> 02:09:44.920
It is.

02:09:45.080 --> 02:09:48.000
Well, Konami may actually announce whatever June thing there is.

02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:54.040
So in all seriousness, Summer Game Fest now, and announcements that come with that.

02:09:54.040 --> 02:09:57.040
Maybe we'll see a Silent Hill 2 thing come out of that.

02:09:57.040 --> 02:09:58.200
That could be very interesting.

02:09:58.440 --> 02:09:58.760
So.

02:09:58.800 --> 02:10:08.600
My three happy E3 memories ever was getting to chat through an interpreter with Koji Kondo and getting his autograph.

02:10:09.560 --> 02:10:15.240
And partially getting to meet Akira Yamaoka.

02:10:16.200 --> 02:10:22.360
And getting my picture taken with Igarashi and making him jump out of his skin when I asked him in Japanese, if I could.

02:10:24.280 --> 02:10:25.080
You were there for that.

02:10:25.080 --> 02:10:25.640
I was.

02:10:25.640 --> 02:10:26.120
I was.

02:10:26.120 --> 02:10:26.840
You took the picture.

02:10:26.840 --> 02:10:27.200
I did.

02:10:27.640 --> 02:10:28.040
Yeah.

02:10:28.680 --> 02:10:29.920
Notice I wasn't in the picture.

02:10:29.920 --> 02:10:30.320
I just didn't know.

02:10:30.320 --> 02:10:31.320
With his hat.

02:10:31.880 --> 02:10:32.760
That hat.

02:10:33.600 --> 02:10:36.120
Meeting Igarashi was, was pretty cool.

02:10:36.120 --> 02:10:36.840
He's a rock star.

02:10:36.840 --> 02:10:37.120
Yeah.

02:10:37.760 --> 02:10:38.640
All right, moving on.

02:10:38.640 --> 02:10:40.880
Just a couple more stories and then we can wrap up.

02:10:40.880 --> 02:10:41.520
So, Loki.

02:10:42.800 --> 02:10:43.200
All right.

02:10:43.920 --> 02:10:45.840
So I think we talked about this before.

02:10:45.840 --> 02:10:53.280
The Unreal editor that's coming out for Fortnite that basically allows you to kind of make your own games and stuff out of it.

02:10:53.600 --> 02:10:54.480
It's kind of like.

02:10:55.200 --> 02:10:56.000
That was last week.

02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:56.560
Yeah.

02:10:56.560 --> 02:10:56.880
Yeah.

02:10:56.880 --> 02:10:59.920
It's, it's kind of like Roblox, but not like Roblox.

02:10:59.920 --> 02:11:02.720
It's more like, almost like Dreams a little bit.

02:11:03.280 --> 02:11:07.920
But, um, people have already been making things out of it and it looks pretty fantastic.

02:11:07.920 --> 02:11:13.920
And we have things, of course, recreating other games is something that has been a common theme.

02:11:13.920 --> 02:11:21.840
So we have, uh, no World 1-1, but, you know, uh, Grove Street from Grand Theft Auto 5.

02:11:21.840 --> 02:11:31.920
Um, you have people recreating Counter-Strike levels, Mario Kart tracks, um, the, uh, castle from, uh, Super Mario 64.

02:11:31.920 --> 02:11:33.200
That type of stuff.

02:11:33.200 --> 02:11:39.680
And even folks have brought in, um, the original map from Fortnite into Fortnite.

02:11:41.120 --> 02:11:43.200
And you can actually play it too, which is pretty cool.

02:11:43.760 --> 02:11:50.560
So yeah, I'm very excited to see what they do with this, but I'm not sure how the games are going to be presented in there.

02:11:50.560 --> 02:11:53.680
How you can actually play all this stuff, but it sounds cool.

02:11:54.720 --> 02:11:54.960
Yeah.

02:11:56.000 --> 02:12:01.840
Uh, I, it's only been a week and I, but what cracked me up most about that story was somebody put the original Fortnite.

02:12:01.920 --> 02:12:04.080
Fortnite map back in Fortnite, because of course they did.

02:12:06.240 --> 02:12:07.120
I like the original.

02:12:07.680 --> 02:12:12.080
Fortnite can't get away with changing those, but they will, of course, but it's just funny.

02:12:12.080 --> 02:12:17.360
People are always going to miss the old shit and they'll, now they can use this to put it right back in there, which is funnier, funnier.

02:12:17.360 --> 02:12:18.800
So, all right.

02:12:19.760 --> 02:12:26.400
And lastly, tonight we have news on the next game from the creators of Genshin Impact, which is a game I tried to get into.

02:12:26.400 --> 02:12:27.680
It didn't really land for me.

02:12:28.320 --> 02:12:29.600
Maybe this one will, I don't know.

02:12:29.600 --> 02:12:32.160
But it's a game called Honkai Star Rail.

02:12:32.160 --> 02:12:34.160
It's going to be coming out on PC and mobile.

02:12:34.160 --> 02:12:37.760
And they say a PlayStation version will be coming later for five and four.

02:12:38.400 --> 02:12:51.520
This is now a space fantasy tactical RPG, and it's turn-based unlike Genshin Impact, which almost feels like kind of Breath of the Wild gone anime a little bit mixed with some traditional RPG elements.

02:12:51.520 --> 02:12:55.840
But Honkai is going to be a turn-based RPG, which could be very interesting.

02:12:56.800 --> 02:13:00.320
And there are trailers, but the trailers don't tell you shit.

02:13:00.320 --> 02:13:04.000
They're just basically anime characters and all that stuff and trying to get you into it.

02:13:05.600 --> 02:13:19.040
The story will follow a protagonist with a stellaron implant that is a mysterious life form that responds to the world's desire to advance on a quest to discover the truth about the, their words, cancer of all worlds.

02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:26.960
The tutorial level is on Herta Space Station, and then you go to a snow planet, Jorilov 6, and other diverse world.

02:13:26.960 --> 02:13:28.160
It is a free to play game.

02:13:28.160 --> 02:13:34.560
And of course, that means they're going to use gacha mechanics, loot boxes, characters, items to monetize.

02:13:36.880 --> 02:13:38.560
Do you go to diverse systems?

02:13:40.480 --> 02:13:40.980
No.

02:13:42.800 --> 02:13:45.040
So this is a free to play game.

02:13:45.040 --> 02:13:46.720
It's going to be rated T for Teen.

02:13:46.720 --> 02:13:51.040
It will be on PC, but it is exclusive to Epic Game Store on PC.

02:13:51.040 --> 02:13:56.960
But it'll also be available on iOS and Android and then eventually a PlayStation version.

02:13:56.960 --> 02:13:59.440
And that seemed to be when Genshin really took off.

02:13:59.440 --> 02:14:03.440
So it'll be interesting to see that how this does at first, but we'll see.

02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:04.500
So.

02:14:05.040 --> 02:14:05.540
All right.

02:14:06.880 --> 02:14:09.680
That's it for the stories we have on deck currently.

02:14:09.680 --> 02:14:13.360
I did want to mention, it oddly didn't come up in the rest of the show.

02:14:13.360 --> 02:14:18.960
But there were some big conventions going on this weekend, namely Game Developers Conference,

02:14:18.960 --> 02:14:24.320
which some of these things, which funny enough, you know, that whole Counter-Strike 2 thing

02:14:25.040 --> 02:14:32.960
that was timed at the exact same time as Epic's big thing at Game Developer Conference.

02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:34.720
Coincidence?

02:14:35.840 --> 02:14:36.480
I think not.

02:14:36.480 --> 02:14:37.680
I think not.

02:14:37.680 --> 02:14:39.920
But just something interesting to know.

02:14:39.920 --> 02:14:42.080
But Game Developers Conference was this weekend, of course.

02:14:42.080 --> 02:14:46.320
And so, you know, not that Game Developers Conference is a place where they do a lot

02:14:46.320 --> 02:14:49.200
of announcements, but sometimes we get things out of it, right?

02:14:49.200 --> 02:14:52.320
Like Sony has been known to show off things.

02:14:52.320 --> 02:14:55.040
Like I want to say the move was there, you know, some time ago.

02:14:55.040 --> 02:14:59.280
Sometimes it might be about more like peripherals and those sorts of things to like future

02:14:59.280 --> 02:15:01.200
developments of these things.

02:15:01.200 --> 02:15:04.320
But you usually don't get a lot of gaming news news out of GDC.

02:15:04.320 --> 02:15:06.160
PAX East was also this weekend.

02:15:07.040 --> 02:15:12.000
Again, not a place you get a ton of news usually, but there are oftentimes panels

02:15:12.240 --> 02:15:14.400
that can even be put on by developers.

02:15:15.200 --> 02:15:19.680
And so actually, I know there was a Final Fantasy XIV panel as well as a Final Fantasy

02:15:19.680 --> 02:15:22.240
XVI panel because Yoshida was there.

02:15:23.680 --> 02:15:27.440
But it didn't seem like there was a lot of new information out of those panels, except

02:15:27.440 --> 02:15:32.880
apparently, you know, if you believe it, and I don't see why not, Yoshi P was playing

02:15:32.880 --> 02:15:36.320
Final Fantasy XVI on a PlayStation 5 live.

02:15:36.320 --> 02:15:38.960
Like they had the controller there and they were playing the game live.

02:15:38.960 --> 02:15:43.440
So it's that close to being done, which for a June release, you would expect it needs

02:15:43.440 --> 02:15:45.520
to be at that kind of state at this point.

02:15:45.520 --> 02:15:49.600
It may not be like gold, but at real close, real close at this point.

02:15:49.600 --> 02:15:50.720
So, yeah.

02:15:50.720 --> 02:15:57.040
And DJ Rama S also points off a ton of other gaming adjacent, you know, nerdy conventions

02:15:57.040 --> 02:15:57.920
and other places too.

02:15:58.640 --> 02:16:02.480
WonderCon, ZenkaiaCon, GalaxyCon, all of those are this week.

02:16:02.480 --> 02:16:03.760
I had a friend at WonderCon.

02:16:03.760 --> 02:16:04.960
So it's, yeah, busy.

02:16:04.960 --> 02:16:09.440
And I know the cast of, at least some of the cast of anime jam session was at ZenkaiaCon

02:16:09.440 --> 02:16:11.440
because I saw DJ Rama's post.

02:16:12.080 --> 02:16:18.400
So ZenkaiaCon, no ZenkaiaCon, ZenkaiaCon.

02:16:18.400 --> 02:16:19.600
I keep adding an extra vowel.

02:16:20.240 --> 02:16:20.740
All right.

02:16:22.080 --> 02:16:27.040
So anyway, let's go to the listener roundtable.

02:16:27.040 --> 02:16:28.720
We want to check in with some emails.

02:16:28.720 --> 02:16:32.160
Participate at orangesontrated.com is the place to send some emails.

02:16:32.160 --> 02:16:36.080
You can also join our discord server, vognetwork.com slash discord.

02:16:36.080 --> 02:16:42.000
If you want to be able to call the show, we have a room that says green room and we'll

02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:42.800
take calls there.

02:16:42.800 --> 02:16:44.480
So let's get to the mailbag.

02:16:44.480 --> 02:16:46.400
Participate at orangesontrated.com.

02:16:47.360 --> 02:16:48.480
Too much crap on my desk.

02:16:51.760 --> 02:16:53.280
So we do have an email.

02:16:53.280 --> 02:16:53.780
Yay.

02:16:54.400 --> 02:16:54.900
Uno.

02:16:55.920 --> 02:16:56.420
If you're ready?

02:16:57.040 --> 02:16:57.540
Yes.

02:16:57.540 --> 02:16:58.640
Hello, LR.

02:16:58.640 --> 02:16:59.760
So, hi, Y-Y-R.

02:17:00.400 --> 02:17:04.480
You may already have mentioned this earlier in the show, but for the possible benefits

02:17:04.480 --> 02:17:07.840
of the live listeners, I just want to iterate or reiterate one thing tonight.

02:17:07.840 --> 02:17:12.800
March 26 could be your last opportunity to purchase games, DLC, and other items from

02:17:12.800 --> 02:17:15.280
the Nintendo eShop, either on 3DS or Wii U.

02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:18.160
Nintendo's own language is vague.

02:17:18.160 --> 02:17:23.040
As of March 27th, 2023, it will no longer be possible to make purchases.

02:17:23.040 --> 02:17:28.400
So as we don't know whether the shop is shutting down tonight at midnight Pacific time, tomorrow

02:17:28.400 --> 02:17:33.200
morning, or at some other time tomorrow, it would be prudent to assume that tonight is

02:17:33.200 --> 02:17:33.920
your last chance.

02:17:34.480 --> 02:17:38.080
I was wondering if it was going to be on Tokyo time.

02:17:38.080 --> 02:17:42.880
Anyway, while this is not the first digital store shut down on a major platform, it's

02:17:42.880 --> 02:17:45.280
certainly the most significant to date.

02:17:45.280 --> 02:17:52.400
We are not often lamenting the loss of DLC on the original Xbox or the loss of the PlayStation

02:17:52.400 --> 02:17:57.440
mobile games on Vita, but here we are losing a significant portion of Nintendo's history,

02:17:57.440 --> 02:18:02.080
spanning over 10 years and even more than that if you consider that this will mark the

02:18:02.080 --> 02:18:03.840
end of Virtual Console.

02:18:03.840 --> 02:18:08.800
Yes, it will no longer be possible to outright buy digital copies of Nintendo's classic games.

02:18:08.800 --> 02:18:13.440
After tomorrow, you can only subscribe to them via Nintendo Switch online.

02:18:13.440 --> 02:18:19.600
It is still possible to add funds to your 3DS and Wii U as long as you linked them to

02:18:19.600 --> 02:18:20.960
your Nintendo account.

02:18:20.960 --> 02:18:25.520
Just add funds either on your Switch or on Nintendo's website and they will instantly

02:18:25.520 --> 02:18:28.320
appear on your linked 3DS and Wii U consoles.

02:18:28.320 --> 02:18:31.200
It will also be possible to redownload content after the closures.

02:18:31.200 --> 02:18:32.080
Don't worry about that.

02:18:32.640 --> 02:18:36.320
Here is a partial list of things that will be disappearing tomorrow that you might not

02:18:36.320 --> 02:18:37.520
have considered.

02:18:37.520 --> 02:18:42.160
All of the games available via Street Pass Me Plaza, Street Pass itself will still work.

02:18:42.880 --> 02:18:47.200
All of the DLC available for all of the Fire Emblem games released on 3DS.

02:18:47.200 --> 02:18:51.920
This includes the entire final campaign of the Fire Emblem Fates, which is only otherwise

02:18:51.920 --> 02:18:56.400
available on the physical special edition, which now goes for over $500 on eBay.

02:18:57.040 --> 02:19:01.440
The Nintendo DS Virtual Console games available on Wii U, which will allow you to use your

02:19:01.440 --> 02:19:04.240
TV as the top screen and the Wii U gamepad as the bottom screen.

02:19:04.960 --> 02:19:09.760
All of the hundreds of available free demos, the ability to unlock minigames and Rusty's

02:19:09.760 --> 02:19:14.320
real-deal baseball, as well as the ability to progress through the story of the game

02:19:14.320 --> 02:19:14.800
itself.

02:19:15.360 --> 02:19:19.920
The digital versions of Pokemon Red, Blue, Yellow, Gold, Silver, and Crystal, which will

02:19:19.920 --> 02:19:24.880
allow you to transfer Pokemon forward into other 3DS games or the new Pokemon Home.

02:19:26.160 --> 02:19:30.160
The Pokemon Bank app, which you'll need if you want to transfer anything forward from

02:19:30.160 --> 02:19:31.920
any of the pre-switch Pokemon games.

02:19:32.480 --> 02:19:36.960
The ridiculous love child of Derby Owners Club and Tri-Peak Solitaire that is Pocket

02:19:36.960 --> 02:19:37.840
Card Jockey.

02:19:37.840 --> 02:19:40.480
Trust me on this one, it's $6 well spent.

02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:47.600
Just one more reminder that DLC in the Nintendo 3DS games is only available via the games

02:19:47.600 --> 02:19:48.560
themselves.

02:19:48.560 --> 02:19:53.920
In some cases, you'll need to progress beyond a certain point before the DLC becomes available.

02:19:53.920 --> 02:19:57.920
For example, in New Super Mario Brothers 2, you need to finish World 1 before you can

02:19:57.920 --> 02:19:59.520
buy the Coin Rush Course packs.

02:20:00.160 --> 02:20:04.320
Good luck to everyone and try not to spend too much, and of course, enjoy your week.

02:20:04.320 --> 02:20:05.600
I spent way too much money.

02:20:05.600 --> 02:20:06.480
Aaron, YYR.

02:20:07.600 --> 02:20:09.360
Well, thanks for the heads up, Aaron.

02:20:09.360 --> 02:20:11.920
We did talk a little bit about this last week, but...

02:20:12.560 --> 02:20:13.200
Oh, go ahead.

02:20:13.760 --> 02:20:17.840
Well, I was just going to say what Mike said, Pocket Card Jockey is on Apple Arcade.

02:20:18.800 --> 02:20:19.520
There was a little bit of...

02:20:20.400 --> 02:20:25.920
YYR is talking with somebody in Discord about that and kind of giving his case for why

02:20:27.280 --> 02:20:31.280
there may still be some reason to get the 3DS version even with the Apple Arcade version

02:20:31.280 --> 02:20:33.440
out there, but that's really a preference thing at this point.

02:20:33.440 --> 02:20:37.360
But I was going to point out, we did talk a little bit about this last week, but I know

02:20:37.360 --> 02:20:42.160
YYR has been traveling because I saw where the gifts were coming from, YYR and Pokemon,

02:20:43.120 --> 02:20:45.520
which I wish you'd let me know, but that's all right, that's all right.

02:20:45.840 --> 02:20:47.680
It's freaking cute, by the way.

02:20:47.680 --> 02:20:48.180
What's that?

02:20:48.880 --> 02:20:49.760
The game is super cute, by the way.

02:20:49.760 --> 02:20:50.560
Oh, yeah, it's cute.

02:20:51.600 --> 02:20:56.080
But I did like in there that there were a lot of suggestions because we were asking for

02:20:56.080 --> 02:20:59.600
those last week, and I had forgotten about things like Pocket Card Jockey and some of

02:20:59.600 --> 02:21:04.080
those other things he kind of gets into there, so I like the recommendation list there.

02:21:04.080 --> 02:21:07.680
I do want to say, with all that being said, there is a part of me, and I kind of referenced

02:21:07.680 --> 02:21:10.880
this earlier in the show, there's a part of me that's like, you know what, at this point,

02:21:10.880 --> 02:21:14.560
I don't want to reward Nintendo for what they're doing here, because you're right,

02:21:15.520 --> 02:21:18.240
and I'm not policing anyone else's activity.

02:21:18.240 --> 02:21:19.840
Y'all spend your money on what makes you happy.

02:21:19.840 --> 02:21:22.560
I'm just going to be completely, bluntly, brutally honest.

02:21:23.440 --> 02:21:27.280
If the store is closing at this point, and Nintendo is effectively done with support

02:21:27.280 --> 02:21:31.040
for these systems, then I'm waiting for the next homebrew to come out to crack the shit

02:21:31.040 --> 02:21:33.440
out of these things, because Nintendo probably won't patch it.

02:21:33.440 --> 02:21:34.320
They might.

02:21:34.320 --> 02:21:35.200
They still might.

02:21:35.200 --> 02:21:38.880
I feel like they'll wake up their team enough to be able to do that, but I think we're

02:21:38.880 --> 02:21:42.720
going to get some pretty solid homebrew stuff, and essentially, the piracy is going to be

02:21:42.800 --> 02:21:47.840
wide open for this, and do I care at this point?

02:21:47.840 --> 02:21:51.920
No, because Nintendo has literally taken the legitimate avenue away.

02:21:53.040 --> 02:21:58.640
But let's also be honest, am I itching to get in there and play 3DS games and Wii U

02:21:58.640 --> 02:22:02.560
games, especially with what else is going on this year?

02:22:02.560 --> 02:22:03.120
Not really.

02:22:04.160 --> 02:22:09.200
But I also understand, and I've openly admitted this on the show, I don't usually play a lot

02:22:09.200 --> 02:22:13.200
of games on the go, and there are a lot of people that feel very differently about gaming

02:22:13.200 --> 02:22:16.160
who love to play on the Switch, who love to play on the 3DS.

02:22:16.160 --> 02:22:16.880
Cool.

02:22:16.880 --> 02:22:20.080
So again, you've got to do what you've got to do.

02:22:20.080 --> 02:22:22.720
For me, I don't want to give Nintendo any more money over this.

02:22:23.600 --> 02:22:27.360
At this point, I'll turn to piracy if there's something, or emulation is probably what it'll

02:22:27.360 --> 02:22:29.520
really be by the time I really want to get around to something.

02:22:29.520 --> 02:22:33.280
I'll turn to emulation to look at playing some of these games from the past that I'd

02:22:33.280 --> 02:22:33.760
like to do.

02:22:35.440 --> 02:22:38.640
But we should also endorse the legitimate routes.

02:22:38.640 --> 02:22:40.160
I realize it's a slippery slope.

02:22:41.280 --> 02:22:41.760
There you go.

02:22:42.400 --> 02:22:43.440
We have some calls.

02:22:43.440 --> 02:22:45.520
Arguments by their nature are fallacious.

02:22:47.280 --> 02:22:49.360
Let's get into the green room.

02:22:49.360 --> 02:22:52.560
We have some calls waiting to get on air tonight, so let's get to it.

02:22:52.560 --> 02:22:55.920
I'm going to start bringing some folks on, and let's bring our first caller on.

02:22:55.920 --> 02:22:58.080
And hello, you are on Orange Launch Radio.

02:22:58.080 --> 02:22:58.560
Who's this?

02:22:59.680 --> 02:23:07.200
Hi, this is Fixation Gaze, a friend of Jamie's and a short time enjoyer of the VOG Network.

02:23:07.200 --> 02:23:08.480
Well, hello, hello.

02:23:08.480 --> 02:23:10.560
I recognize you from Team Eat.

02:23:10.560 --> 02:23:13.600
I believe you all call yourselves over there on our channel.

02:23:13.600 --> 02:23:14.160
Yes.

02:23:14.160 --> 02:23:16.320
So welcome to Orange Launch Radio.

02:23:17.760 --> 02:23:20.960
Our branded jackets are coming soon, but thank you for having me.

02:23:23.120 --> 02:23:26.720
I've never done a call-in before, but one of the topics I wanted to bring up is something

02:23:26.720 --> 02:23:31.440
that makes me especially happy recently is the Resident 4 remake.

02:23:31.440 --> 02:23:34.960
Yes, a friend of mine was playing this, and I was watching him play this.

02:23:34.960 --> 02:23:36.160
It looks so good.

02:23:36.160 --> 02:23:37.280
Yes, please elaborate.

02:23:37.280 --> 02:23:37.600
Yeah, yeah.

02:23:38.560 --> 02:23:44.800
Okay, so I'm going to preface this with Resident Evil is a long time hyper fixation of mine.

02:23:44.800 --> 02:23:52.000
So seeing the remake has been almost like kind of a sacrilegious kind of experience because

02:23:52.000 --> 02:23:55.680
it's like they keep some of the things that make it so integral and so good, but then

02:23:55.680 --> 02:23:57.040
they also add things.

02:23:57.040 --> 02:24:01.280
And at first it's like, oh gosh, change is scary, which is normal for people who are

02:24:01.280 --> 02:24:05.840
hardcore fans, but then they turn it into something like absolutely excellent.

02:24:06.560 --> 02:24:11.440
Um, such as one of the biggest things that they changed that a lot of people won't really

02:24:11.440 --> 02:24:16.320
see when they just play through the game normally is when you break boxes now, instead of like

02:24:16.320 --> 02:24:18.720
taking out your knife, now Leon does a little kick.

02:24:19.280 --> 02:24:24.080
And that's something you wouldn't notice with a normal gameplay, but with, but with, you

02:24:24.080 --> 02:24:29.200
know, like compare and contrast exactly back to the old games, the one of the biggest things

02:24:29.200 --> 02:24:33.760
that some people didn't like was how it was slow to take out your knife and hit boxes.

02:24:33.840 --> 02:24:36.800
And now it's sped up in a way that's believable.

02:24:36.800 --> 02:24:42.640
So it was terrifying to see like a new aspect of something I care very deeply about, but

02:24:42.640 --> 02:24:47.920
they they've treaded that ground with such care and respect that it is.

02:24:47.920 --> 02:24:52.320
I really applaud Capcom on this, but I also do have to bring up the, uh, a lot of people

02:24:52.320 --> 02:24:57.680
have been talking about how it glitches and how it's causing computer crash crashes and

02:24:57.680 --> 02:24:59.760
not working as well as it should.

02:25:01.280 --> 02:25:02.560
And that is something to bring up.

02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:07.680
Hopefully it's something they can kind of address with patches, which I know we all

02:25:07.680 --> 02:25:11.120
hate that this is where the industry is at, but the reality is this is where the industry

02:25:11.120 --> 02:25:11.840
is at.

02:25:11.840 --> 02:25:16.560
And I tend to cut these companies a little more slack when it comes to PC gaming, because

02:25:16.560 --> 02:25:19.200
reality is every PC configuration is different.

02:25:19.200 --> 02:25:21.440
So it is kind of hard to test every configuration.

02:25:21.440 --> 02:25:26.400
So I do, I cut a little more slack on PC based issues because it can be hard to find those

02:25:26.400 --> 02:25:26.960
things.

02:25:26.960 --> 02:25:30.240
So at least there's that potential to patch that stuff later on.

02:25:30.240 --> 02:25:32.400
And hopefully Capcom stays on top of that.

02:25:32.400 --> 02:25:33.200
I think they will.

02:25:33.200 --> 02:25:35.920
Their track record kind of shows they're pretty good about the patching and they can

02:25:35.920 --> 02:25:37.280
get some of those issues fixed.

02:25:37.280 --> 02:25:44.000
But considering what a legendary game Resident Evil 4 is, I mean, there's many, many people

02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:47.920
that consider that that is the best GameCube game, period.

02:25:48.880 --> 02:25:51.120
And maybe even other platforms too.

02:25:52.720 --> 02:25:57.760
The fact that this is a bit of an upgrade when not everything lately in the remaster

02:25:57.760 --> 02:25:59.200
department has been an upgrade.

02:25:59.200 --> 02:26:02.720
The Secret of Mana remake kind of had some bad issues with it.

02:26:02.720 --> 02:26:06.400
Trials of Mana came out a little better and I think maybe redeemed things, but Secret

02:26:06.400 --> 02:26:07.920
of Mana really should have been better than it was.

02:26:08.480 --> 02:26:10.400
Chrono Cross, we were talking about that.

02:26:10.400 --> 02:26:14.640
Finally, a year after the fact, Radical Dreamers Edition gets a patch to fix it.

02:26:14.640 --> 02:26:16.160
But the remaster, eh.

02:26:16.160 --> 02:26:21.920
So it's nice to hear that Capcom is kind of getting a lot of Ws in these Resident Evil

02:26:22.480 --> 02:26:25.680
because I know the earlier remasters were pretty well received too, but this was the

02:26:25.680 --> 02:26:29.760
one people were really waiting for because it's like, don't screw up 4.

02:26:29.760 --> 02:26:30.800
Don't screw up 4.

02:26:31.360 --> 02:26:38.160
Yeah, because of how dense of a game 4 really is and how much it draws from and takes inspiration

02:26:38.160 --> 02:26:43.760
because we're dealing with a virus that takes control of people's minds via parasites and

02:26:43.760 --> 02:26:47.360
we're dealing with politics and we're dealing with giants and fish monsters.

02:26:47.360 --> 02:26:51.680
There is so much in this game that is extremely easy to get it wrong.

02:26:51.680 --> 02:26:52.720
It really is.

02:26:52.720 --> 02:26:58.240
So the fact that they've taken it with grace and it feels good to go through the game.

02:26:58.240 --> 02:26:59.760
It doesn't feel like any of it's rushed.

02:26:59.760 --> 02:27:01.200
It feels like it's open enough.

02:27:01.920 --> 02:27:03.040
There's a lot of double backing.

02:27:03.040 --> 02:27:06.160
They've added new little side quests, which are a lot of fun.

02:27:07.360 --> 02:27:12.560
But I feel like they've taken Resident Evil 4 and I think they did it really well.

02:27:12.560 --> 02:27:16.400
They've of course removed some of the original funny lines, but they've kept a lot of what

02:27:16.400 --> 02:27:21.520
makes Leon Leon at this phase in what is quote unquote his life, because of course this is

02:27:21.520 --> 02:27:22.480
a game character.

02:27:22.480 --> 02:27:25.360
But they've stayed true to what he was in Resident Evil 4.

02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:29.920
And so far from what I've seen, I haven't played through the whole game, mind you.

02:27:29.920 --> 02:27:32.960
They have stayed true to what Ashley is.

02:27:32.960 --> 02:27:39.280
And that was another big thing about Resident Evil 4 originally was how fucking annoying

02:27:39.280 --> 02:27:39.840
she was.

02:27:41.040 --> 02:27:46.240
But it seems like they've toned her down, but also staying to her personality.

02:27:46.240 --> 02:27:51.760
And that is something that's very important to me for the validity of it being a remaster.

02:27:52.080 --> 02:27:55.520
And sometimes these remakes really do redeem certain characters.

02:27:55.520 --> 02:27:58.560
I think back to the Final Fantasy 7 remake and Aerith.

02:27:58.560 --> 02:28:03.040
And I think Jamie, I remember even you saying, you know, she doesn't bother me in the remake

02:28:03.040 --> 02:28:04.800
as much as she did in the original.

02:28:04.800 --> 02:28:07.280
But her fucking annoying as she was.

02:28:10.720 --> 02:28:12.960
And the voice actors did a tremendous job as well.

02:28:12.960 --> 02:28:14.080
Should be committed for that.

02:28:14.080 --> 02:28:14.800
Absolutely.

02:28:15.600 --> 02:28:18.960
I still don't have my save file so I can fight Jenova and then watch her die.

02:28:19.840 --> 02:28:22.640
Let me ask you this, because I know we want to get to another call before we wrap up the

02:28:22.640 --> 02:28:26.640
show, but I want to ask you this as someone who's a self-described Resident Evil fan.

02:28:26.640 --> 02:28:30.240
You know, do you hope that they keep going with these remakes?

02:28:30.240 --> 02:28:31.760
Do you want to see an RE5?

02:28:31.760 --> 02:28:35.360
I know 5 and 6 weren't quite as well received in the bigger picture.

02:28:35.360 --> 02:28:37.520
Do you want them to try again with those games?

02:28:37.520 --> 02:28:39.520
Or where do you kind of hope these remakes go?

02:28:39.520 --> 02:28:43.120
Or are you like, stop here, quit when you're ahead, stop here, don't do any more.

02:28:44.240 --> 02:28:48.320
So this might be a controversial take because I speak on behalf of me, but not really like

02:28:48.320 --> 02:28:52.640
Resident Evil fans as a whole, because we're kind of divided on some things.

02:28:52.640 --> 02:28:57.760
But honestly, with the resources they have now and the ideas and how they've seen things

02:28:57.760 --> 02:29:03.120
turn out, I think they should give it another shot, rework some of those games and release

02:29:03.120 --> 02:29:04.800
them to be better.

02:29:04.800 --> 02:29:10.880
I think they should absolutely go through with remaking the whole original series before

02:29:10.880 --> 02:29:16.000
the new arc, which is the Ethan Winters arc that comes in 7 and 8.

02:29:16.000 --> 02:29:17.440
But I think they should.

02:29:17.440 --> 02:29:20.640
Because they really tried to bite more than they could chew when they made those games

02:29:20.640 --> 02:29:21.280
originally.

02:29:21.920 --> 02:29:23.360
And they should do it.

02:29:23.360 --> 02:29:24.080
I think they should.

02:29:24.080 --> 02:29:27.040
They should put their money where their mouth is and do it all.

02:29:27.040 --> 02:29:30.160
Well, you have at least one person in chat agreeing with you because Shane says they

02:29:30.160 --> 02:29:31.120
better remake 6.

02:29:32.960 --> 02:29:34.000
Absolutely.

02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:34.720
Absolutely.

02:29:36.160 --> 02:29:38.000
Fixie, real quick before we let you go.

02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:43.360
I know you're in the process of trying to grow your own.

02:29:43.360 --> 02:29:45.120
Is that a nickname you prefer?

02:29:45.120 --> 02:29:47.120
I'm only calling you that because Jamie calls you that.

02:29:47.520 --> 02:29:47.840
Fine.

02:29:47.840 --> 02:29:48.400
You're fine.

02:29:48.400 --> 02:29:53.360
I've gotten a lot of variations on my username, and I think Fixie is my favorite so far.

02:29:53.360 --> 02:29:53.860
Okay, okay.

02:29:54.400 --> 02:29:57.280
So I know you're trying to grow your own Twitch channel.

02:29:57.280 --> 02:30:00.480
I gave you a shout out on our channel, but do you want to quickly just kind of plug your

02:30:00.480 --> 02:30:03.520
channel and what folks can expect over on your Twitch channel?

02:30:04.640 --> 02:30:05.360
Oh, sure.

02:30:05.360 --> 02:30:06.160
Absolutely.

02:30:06.160 --> 02:30:10.720
Well, so my channel and my Twitch is what I primarily do is I play a lot of Dead by

02:30:10.720 --> 02:30:16.720
Daylight, but I'm hoping as I upgrade my hardware and I stick to a schedule that I go into more

02:30:16.720 --> 02:30:22.640
of the horror demographic because I used to be a balloon streamer and that is very much

02:30:22.640 --> 02:30:25.040
anti everything horror.

02:30:25.040 --> 02:30:25.920
It is very soft.

02:30:25.920 --> 02:30:29.920
It's very noise is just like soft, repetitive noises.

02:30:30.480 --> 02:30:38.080
But my next big goal is to play the entirety of the Outlast series and then want to start

02:30:38.080 --> 02:30:40.320
and do the entire Resident Evil series.

02:30:41.040 --> 02:30:45.680
Well, somebody, I'm going to tell you this, you won't catch me ever doing a play through

02:30:45.680 --> 02:30:48.080
of Outlast, so you are braver than I.

02:30:49.280 --> 02:30:57.840
I had a hyper fixation on Outlast Whistleblower, which is by far to me one of the most horrific

02:30:57.840 --> 02:30:59.760
DLCs that has ever been made.

02:31:00.720 --> 02:31:01.440
Oh, my gosh.

02:31:03.360 --> 02:31:07.920
No, that was the game Amnesia I was thinking of where I saw this YouTube where somebody

02:31:07.920 --> 02:31:11.760
I think it was the sequel Amnesia where somebody started it and literally within five seconds

02:31:11.840 --> 02:31:17.200
they go, nope, and they close the game because it scared the shit out of them.

02:31:17.200 --> 02:31:22.160
The first time I ever played Outlast, I had to keep the lights on in the room.

02:31:22.160 --> 02:31:25.840
And I remember I was playing with friends because we had decided if one of us gets too

02:31:25.840 --> 02:31:28.400
scared, another person will hop on and continue.

02:31:28.400 --> 02:31:31.120
And they kept turning the lights off for quote unquote atmosphere.

02:31:31.120 --> 02:31:35.840
And I said, I swear to God, if you do not turn that light on right now, I am not playing

02:31:35.840 --> 02:31:36.480
this.

02:31:36.480 --> 02:31:41.920
But now that I've gotten to be more of a horror buff and a lot more acclimated to screaming

02:31:41.920 --> 02:31:46.480
due to Dead by Daylight and the jump scares that happen in a multiplayer game, I think

02:31:46.480 --> 02:31:50.560
I'm ready to do it by myself with the lights off, with the lights off.

02:31:50.560 --> 02:31:51.360
Oh, my gosh.

02:31:51.360 --> 02:31:52.080
No, no.

02:31:52.080 --> 02:31:57.200
I remember when I played Silent Hill Homecoming for the first time, I was playing it on Xbox

02:31:57.200 --> 02:31:59.040
at home in the middle of a rainstorm.

02:31:59.040 --> 02:32:01.680
And I was playing with the lights off, which is fine, whatever.

02:32:02.400 --> 02:32:08.080
But as I was playing the game and they get to a scary scene, the rain and wind blew the

02:32:08.080 --> 02:32:10.880
front door open because I guess I forgot to lock it.

02:32:10.880 --> 02:32:14.160
And that's when I said, nope, nope, nope.

02:32:14.160 --> 02:32:19.280
I closed the door, immediately powered off the Xbox, went into my room and totally did

02:32:19.280 --> 02:32:20.400
the blanket burrito.

02:32:20.400 --> 02:32:23.040
Or I said, this is where I live now.

02:32:23.040 --> 02:32:24.720
I moved into a blanket.

02:32:24.720 --> 02:32:31.280
I started actually being scared of Call of Duty zombies.

02:32:32.160 --> 02:32:38.560
And now I've yeah, I used to be terrified of everything scary, but now now I fully immerse

02:32:38.560 --> 02:32:40.320
myself into the scary culture.

02:32:40.320 --> 02:32:45.440
I read scary stories in my old house with no lights on in the hallways, and I keep my

02:32:45.440 --> 02:32:46.720
door open and I go to sleep.

02:32:47.600 --> 02:32:51.200
I have fully tamed it out of me and I'm going to do some scary stuff.

02:32:51.200 --> 02:32:55.520
So you guys should totally check me out on my Twitch channel if you like scary things.

02:32:56.240 --> 02:32:56.800
All right.

02:32:56.800 --> 02:32:58.640
Well, and Fixie and I co-stream.

02:32:59.440 --> 02:33:02.240
Yeah, I saw you streaming the other night and you both were.

02:33:02.240 --> 02:33:03.040
Yeah, I saw that.

02:33:03.040 --> 02:33:03.680
So.

02:33:03.680 --> 02:33:04.080
All right.

02:33:04.080 --> 02:33:06.640
Well, Fixie, best of luck with the growth of your own channel.

02:33:06.640 --> 02:33:09.120
I'm going to let you go so we can get another call in here before we end tonight.

02:33:09.120 --> 02:33:12.000
But thanks so much for calling and good luck with the games and your channel growth.

02:33:12.000 --> 02:33:13.360
Thank you so much for having me.

02:33:13.360 --> 02:33:13.920
You're welcome.

02:33:13.920 --> 02:33:14.320
Anytime.

02:33:14.320 --> 02:33:14.800
Take care.

02:33:16.480 --> 02:33:16.880
All right.

02:33:16.880 --> 02:33:20.560
Fixie and I need to have like a watch party where we watch Midsommar.

02:33:21.120 --> 02:33:22.320
Oh, my gosh.

02:33:22.320 --> 02:33:27.280
Is Midsommar on the Amazon service or whatever?

02:33:28.160 --> 02:33:29.840
I don't I don't know.

02:33:30.640 --> 02:33:32.800
I have it on my Apple TV.

02:33:32.800 --> 02:33:33.680
Oh, it's on Prime.

02:33:33.680 --> 02:33:34.160
Cool, cool.

02:33:34.160 --> 02:33:35.360
I love that movie.

02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:37.520
I love like the full version of it.

02:33:38.400 --> 02:33:39.760
We got to go to one more call here.

02:33:39.760 --> 02:33:41.280
I definitely want to hear from this individual as well.

02:33:41.280 --> 02:33:44.160
We haven't heard from in a little while, so let's bring them on the air.

02:33:44.160 --> 02:33:45.680
Hi, you are on Orange Launch Radio.

02:33:45.680 --> 02:33:46.160
Who's this?

02:33:47.200 --> 02:33:48.800
Hello, it's Sturlock.

02:33:48.800 --> 02:33:49.600
Hey, Sturlock.

02:33:49.600 --> 02:33:51.360
Thanks for being patient while we took another call.

02:33:51.360 --> 02:33:52.080
How are you tonight?

02:33:52.880 --> 02:33:53.760
I'm pretty good.

02:33:54.640 --> 02:34:04.400
Uh, so it's not my main topic, but I wanted to add an addendum to YYR's email.

02:34:04.400 --> 02:34:05.840
Please, because it's now or never.

02:34:06.480 --> 02:34:07.600
Yeah, um.

02:34:09.600 --> 02:34:19.280
If you're in the US, you're extra screwed because one of the best rhythm games is going

02:34:19.280 --> 02:34:24.240
away and impossible to buy in the US, and that is Rhythm Heaven Megamix.

02:34:24.240 --> 02:34:29.120
Yeah, released physically everywhere else but the US, so that's fun.

02:34:29.760 --> 02:34:32.160
Yeah, a lot of people lamenting the loss of that one.

02:34:32.160 --> 02:34:34.480
I know that's come up in our Discord several times.

02:34:34.480 --> 02:34:35.920
Yep, great game.

02:34:35.920 --> 02:34:38.320
One of the best one of the best rhythm games ever made.

02:34:38.320 --> 02:34:43.520
I really, really, really hope Rhythm Heaven gets a Switch game, even if it's just a re-release

02:34:43.520 --> 02:34:45.360
of Megamix, I would be happy.

02:34:45.680 --> 02:34:50.640
Well, you'll be happy to know Bobby Blackwolf says that's the game that he bought on his

02:34:50.640 --> 02:34:51.520
3DS this week.

02:34:52.080 --> 02:34:52.560
Oh, good.

02:34:54.560 --> 02:34:55.680
It was a great game.

02:34:55.680 --> 02:34:56.880
So what else is on your mind tonight?

02:34:57.680 --> 02:35:01.760
But the main thing I wanted to talk about was Diablo 4.

02:35:02.320 --> 02:35:08.080
I was hoping this might be the case because we were talking on, not Twitter, the other

02:35:08.080 --> 02:35:11.680
one, Mastodon a little bit about this.

02:35:12.640 --> 02:35:18.400
How have you been enjoying the, and for those that have never heard you on the show before,

02:35:18.400 --> 02:35:23.280
you are blind and you love the hell out of games.

02:35:23.280 --> 02:35:27.120
So you oftentimes kind of enlighten us on the accessibility.

02:35:27.120 --> 02:35:30.480
And actually I know, and I gave you a shout out in chat as well, because I know on your

02:35:30.480 --> 02:35:36.720
Twitch channel, I've learned a lot from watching you play games like The Last of Us, like how

02:35:36.720 --> 02:35:39.680
accessibility settings, like how they help.

02:35:39.680 --> 02:35:43.360
It's one thing to know, like what's there, what's all available, but being able to see

02:35:43.360 --> 02:35:47.920
you use these things, like as you're playing the game really helps me understand how they

02:35:47.920 --> 02:35:48.560
really help.

02:35:48.560 --> 02:35:51.920
So I'm actually, so anyway, sorry, but just to set that up for people who may not know

02:35:51.920 --> 02:35:52.320
you.

02:35:52.320 --> 02:35:54.240
I'm really curious about this afternoon.

02:35:54.240 --> 02:35:55.120
Yeah, just afternoon.

02:35:55.120 --> 02:36:00.480
I was playing Hades with some accessibility mods that that game has.

02:36:01.280 --> 02:36:02.720
Hades is fantastic.

02:36:02.720 --> 02:36:05.840
Even without accessibility mods, it's still pretty playable.

02:36:06.480 --> 02:36:14.320
The mods just add some nice, you know, quality of life things specifically for blind people

02:36:14.320 --> 02:36:17.600
and take a lot of the guesswork out of doing some things.

02:36:18.560 --> 02:36:21.120
So what's your take on Diablo 4?

02:36:21.120 --> 02:36:22.960
Diablo 4 is fantastic.

02:36:24.480 --> 02:36:27.360
What about it gets you happy and excited?

02:36:27.360 --> 02:36:36.000
Well, for one, text to speech menus, fantastic.

02:36:38.240 --> 02:36:47.280
It's a little buggy currently in certain spots like the options menu, but I have full faith

02:36:47.280 --> 02:36:53.600
that that's stuff that's going to be fixed, you know, on launch release.

02:36:53.600 --> 02:36:54.160
Mm hmm.

02:36:55.760 --> 02:36:56.960
And they're taking feedback.

02:36:56.960 --> 02:37:01.120
So it's, you know, they're going to be well aware of this stuff.

02:37:04.720 --> 02:37:15.200
The other thing I would say is I do wish we had some sort of nav assist a la Last of Us

02:37:15.920 --> 02:37:19.600
because this is a much, much bigger world than Diablo 3.

02:37:19.600 --> 02:37:20.160
Mm hmm.

02:37:23.200 --> 02:37:25.680
But I mean, games, it's not even out yet.

02:37:25.680 --> 02:37:29.520
I I think we'll we will get something.

02:37:29.520 --> 02:37:33.920
I don't know what form that's going to take, but I think I think we we will get some sort

02:37:33.920 --> 02:37:36.880
of, you know, assistance as far as that's concerned.

02:37:37.680 --> 02:37:45.920
But the other big, big positive is that since we have text to speech, we can manage our

02:37:45.920 --> 02:37:54.720
own gear, gear, you know, names of items and what they do, what their stats at all reads

02:37:54.720 --> 02:37:55.200
for us.

02:37:56.400 --> 02:38:03.440
And as a Diablo 3 player that, you know, blind people can't manage their gear, that's like

02:38:03.440 --> 02:38:10.560
the really the one thing that you absolutely positively need a sighted person to do for

02:38:10.560 --> 02:38:12.720
you is gear management.

02:38:12.720 --> 02:38:15.280
And we don't need that anymore.

02:38:15.280 --> 02:38:16.320
And it's fantastic.

02:38:20.320 --> 02:38:24.400
Like audio feedback's gotten a lot better because I've noticed on certain operating

02:38:24.400 --> 02:38:27.440
systems that voiceover is a lot better than it was.

02:38:27.440 --> 02:38:27.940
Yeah.

02:38:30.400 --> 02:38:38.000
Yeah, for whatever reason, the on PS4 PS5, it's not as robust.

02:38:38.000 --> 02:38:45.840
And I think that just has to do with maybe it's a slightly older build, but I I think

02:38:45.840 --> 02:38:49.920
it's going to have parity at launch.

02:38:49.920 --> 02:38:51.360
I don't think that's going to be an issue.

02:38:51.360 --> 02:38:51.860
Yeah.

02:38:52.720 --> 02:39:00.080
But the other the other really amazing thing that they did for us specifically is you have

02:39:00.080 --> 02:39:10.320
to turn it on the options menu, but items and gold, you know, loot essentially has background

02:39:10.320 --> 02:39:10.820
ambience.

02:39:12.000 --> 02:39:14.400
So you can tell when things are on the ground.

02:39:14.400 --> 02:39:19.280
Yes, I've noticed that it's a version of that is on by default for legendaries.

02:39:20.320 --> 02:39:22.320
Oh, that's it's on by default for legendary.

02:39:22.320 --> 02:39:25.520
Yeah, because I hear like a shimmer type of noise when you're sending your legendary.

02:39:25.520 --> 02:39:26.020
Yeah.

02:39:26.320 --> 02:39:26.720
Yeah.

02:39:26.720 --> 02:39:32.240
And the rarity to the different rarities have different sounds associated with them.

02:39:32.240 --> 02:39:33.280
It's like, oh, that's just a common.

02:39:33.280 --> 02:39:34.720
I can ignore that, like whatever.

02:39:36.720 --> 02:39:38.960
And you can break it down, too, if you want.

02:39:38.960 --> 02:39:44.720
Like, so if you don't care about like, oh, just ignore all the commons, you can absolutely

02:39:44.720 --> 02:39:45.220
do that.

02:39:46.080 --> 02:39:47.280
You can even break it down.

02:39:48.080 --> 02:39:54.320
I only care about weapons or only care about like chess pieces or whatever.

02:39:54.880 --> 02:39:56.000
You can absolutely do that.

02:39:57.360 --> 02:40:02.080
The amount of control you have over it is pretty awesome.

02:40:03.120 --> 02:40:06.640
Do you think I remember one of the last times you called in and granted it was a little

02:40:06.640 --> 02:40:11.840
while ago now, but I remember we were kind of mourning the loss of Hearthstone, you know,

02:40:11.840 --> 02:40:14.880
had an add on that was really helping folks.

02:40:14.880 --> 02:40:19.520
And you were really hoping that Blizzard would kind of take up things with that to help the

02:40:19.520 --> 02:40:21.200
community be able to play Hearthstone.

02:40:21.920 --> 02:40:30.240
Do you feel like Blizzard now is being receptive to feedback from the community and these sorts

02:40:30.240 --> 02:40:30.740
of things?

02:40:31.360 --> 02:40:32.400
Absolutely.

02:40:32.400 --> 02:40:35.840
There was actually an update to that whole situation.

02:40:35.840 --> 02:40:43.040
I don't know if you reported on it, but Blizzard themselves have come out and said that because

02:40:43.040 --> 02:40:59.200
of the outcry and the support for Hearthstone, that they are looking into adding in native

02:40:59.200 --> 02:41:02.960
accessibility for Hearthstone themselves.

02:41:02.960 --> 02:41:03.460
That's great.

02:41:06.400 --> 02:41:12.080
The other really cool thing is that we didn't actually lose access to Hearthstone for all

02:41:12.080 --> 02:41:19.600
that long because the Hearthstone access patch slash mod, whatever you want to call

02:41:19.600 --> 02:41:24.880
it, has basically become a community driven project.

02:41:25.840 --> 02:41:30.720
I thought that part, I think I do remember hearing about that the community kind of took

02:41:30.720 --> 02:41:31.760
over maintenance of that.

02:41:31.760 --> 02:41:36.080
And I've heard that happen in some other cases before, but that's great to be able to keep

02:41:36.080 --> 02:41:36.640
that going.

02:41:36.640 --> 02:41:40.560
But that's really awesome that Blizzard is, you know, listening to that sort of feedback

02:41:40.560 --> 02:41:46.560
and really making these types of meaningful implementations that you can really feel in

02:41:46.560 --> 02:41:48.560
a game like Diablo 4 when you're playing it.

02:41:49.760 --> 02:41:51.120
And that's great.

02:41:52.160 --> 02:41:56.240
Oh, and another thing to add to Hearthstone, which makes me think that they're taking

02:41:56.240 --> 02:42:03.520
this pretty seriously, is somebody looked into, I guess there were some patch notes

02:42:03.520 --> 02:42:07.680
or a roadmap update for Unity accessibility.

02:42:08.000 --> 02:42:10.400
And they called out Blizzard specifically by name.

02:42:10.400 --> 02:42:18.000
There is a patch note that talks about text to speech or like control elements or something

02:42:18.000 --> 02:42:26.000
to that effect specifically for Blizzard or for use of Blizzard games.

02:42:26.000 --> 02:42:28.560
Like they went out of their way to call them out by name.

02:42:28.560 --> 02:42:35.600
So I think we could actually have accessible mobile Hearthstone, which would be pretty

02:42:36.240 --> 02:42:38.000
epic, actually.

02:42:38.720 --> 02:42:40.800
Well, fingers and toes crossed they can get there.

02:42:40.800 --> 02:42:50.400
I really do feel like Blizzard is taking accessibility extremely seriously.

02:42:51.280 --> 02:42:58.160
And actually, one of my friends, super blind man, is in the Hearthstone creator program

02:42:58.160 --> 02:42:58.560
now.

02:42:58.560 --> 02:43:00.960
So that's awesome.

02:43:01.840 --> 02:43:02.720
It's really awesome.

02:43:03.600 --> 02:43:12.560
Controversies aside, there are people at Blizzard that do very good things.

02:43:12.560 --> 02:43:12.800
Right.

02:43:12.800 --> 02:43:15.600
And we have to call out the problems when the problems come up.

02:43:15.600 --> 02:43:21.440
But we can also acknowledge like, hey, this company took feedback and made meaningful

02:43:21.440 --> 02:43:24.080
changes as a result of that feedback.

02:43:24.080 --> 02:43:25.200
Let's applaud that.

02:43:25.200 --> 02:43:28.480
And I think that's why I'm thankful you called in tonight to talk about how far the

02:43:28.480 --> 02:43:30.320
accessibility has come in Diablo 4.

02:43:30.320 --> 02:43:32.400
Is it completely there yet?

02:43:32.400 --> 02:43:32.880
No.

02:43:32.880 --> 02:43:34.720
But are we moving in a meaningful direction?

02:43:34.720 --> 02:43:35.040
Sure.

02:43:35.040 --> 02:43:35.760
Sounds like it.

02:43:35.760 --> 02:43:37.520
It's a huge step in the direction.

02:43:37.520 --> 02:43:41.760
I had fairly low expectations.

02:43:41.760 --> 02:43:45.680
I figured we'd get maybe one or two things.

02:43:45.680 --> 02:43:49.360
But the amount, the framework that's already here is really impressive.

02:43:49.360 --> 02:43:51.680
And I can't wait to see what else they do with it.

02:43:51.680 --> 02:43:51.920
All right.

02:43:51.920 --> 02:43:53.840
Well, Sturlock, I have to let you go so we can wrap up the show.

02:43:53.840 --> 02:43:55.120
But thank you so much for the call.

02:43:55.120 --> 02:43:56.640
And I give you a shout out in chat.

02:43:56.640 --> 02:44:01.920
I hope folks will consider following along and really getting your perspective on games,

02:44:02.000 --> 02:44:04.000
because I think it's really enlightening.

02:44:04.000 --> 02:44:08.240
So as we continue this conversation about accessibility on into the future.

02:44:08.240 --> 02:44:08.480
All right.

02:44:08.480 --> 02:44:09.040
Yeah, definitely.

02:44:09.040 --> 02:44:09.920
Have a good one, Sturlock.

02:44:09.920 --> 02:44:13.440
And I look forward to running Diablo 4 stuff with you in the future.

02:44:13.440 --> 02:44:14.080
Yeah, definitely.

02:44:14.080 --> 02:44:15.120
Good to hear from you again.

02:44:15.120 --> 02:44:15.760
Yeah.

02:44:15.760 --> 02:44:16.240
Take care.

02:44:16.240 --> 02:44:16.960
Good to be here.

02:44:16.960 --> 02:44:17.440
All right.

02:44:17.440 --> 02:44:17.760
See you.

02:44:17.760 --> 02:44:18.000
Bye.

02:44:18.800 --> 02:44:19.760
All right.

02:44:19.760 --> 02:44:22.880
We had some good calls tonight, but it is getting a little late.

02:44:22.880 --> 02:44:26.880
So I want to make sure we wrap up the show and have it all done before it's midnight

02:44:26.880 --> 02:44:27.520
on the East Coast.

02:44:27.520 --> 02:44:29.600
But to do that, I want to check in real quick.

02:44:29.600 --> 02:44:32.960
Just quickly check in our eight last minute stories would address Loki.

02:44:32.960 --> 02:44:33.440
Oh, yeah.

02:44:33.440 --> 02:44:34.240
Two things real quick.

02:44:34.240 --> 02:44:40.240
So first is Microsoft is ending their one dollar Xbox Game Pass offer that they've had

02:44:40.240 --> 02:44:41.360
for a long time.

02:44:41.360 --> 02:44:43.280
I didn't even know that was still a thing.

02:44:44.400 --> 02:44:47.840
So, yes, unfortunately, they are getting rid of that now.

02:44:48.880 --> 02:44:52.240
Instead, they're saying that anyone signed up for Game Pass said.

02:44:53.120 --> 02:45:00.320
Um, we'll see months from existing subscriptions converted into partial months on a sharing

02:45:00.320 --> 02:45:00.640
plan.

02:45:00.640 --> 02:45:04.400
If you're currently signed up for Xbox Game Pass ultimate, the remaining months will turn

02:45:04.400 --> 02:45:09.600
into 18 days of games past friends and family or something like that when they're talking

02:45:09.600 --> 02:45:13.760
about like the successor game past friends and family, I guess.

02:45:15.760 --> 02:45:20.960
But yeah, they're going to have different promotions as well to basically fill the void,

02:45:20.960 --> 02:45:21.360
I guess.

02:45:21.360 --> 02:45:24.400
But I mean, it wasn't always going to be one dollar forever.

02:45:25.120 --> 02:45:33.200
Another thing I did want to mention, though, is I saw I was asked by the guy that runs

02:45:33.200 --> 02:45:33.840
Nest Maker.

02:45:33.840 --> 02:45:37.760
So he has a collection that he's been putting together.

02:45:37.760 --> 02:45:44.640
So in partnership with the Strong Museum of Play, they have a collection of games.

02:45:44.640 --> 02:45:45.680
Basically, it's in New York.

02:45:45.680 --> 02:45:46.560
It's a museum.

02:45:46.560 --> 02:45:48.720
You can go there and play video games.

02:45:48.720 --> 02:45:50.640
They do archival stuff as well.

02:45:50.640 --> 02:45:55.680
So I get to, along with some of the other Nest Maker people, put my game available to

02:45:55.680 --> 02:45:56.720
play there as well.

02:45:56.720 --> 02:46:02.560
So my game will be part of the Strong Museum collection 2023, which I am.

02:46:02.560 --> 02:46:06.560
Loki, are you saying that they put you in a museum?

02:46:06.560 --> 02:46:07.920
They put me in a museum.

02:46:07.920 --> 02:46:11.280
Yeah, I think I think they're probably accessing the website.

02:46:11.280 --> 02:46:15.680
But yes, in a roundabout way, it will be in a museum.

02:46:17.440 --> 02:46:19.440
Loki, it doesn't get much better than that.

02:46:20.320 --> 02:46:25.040
That's a hell of a thing to have on your resume of what you've accomplished in this life.

02:46:25.040 --> 02:46:26.720
Congrats to the fucking Lations.

02:46:26.720 --> 02:46:28.720
They were showing, well, they had...

02:46:28.720 --> 02:46:30.800
I agree with necessary 100 Matt.

02:46:30.800 --> 02:46:32.560
Somebody buried the fucking lead tonight.

02:46:32.560 --> 02:46:34.800
You're going to talk about this in your gaming week.

02:46:34.800 --> 02:46:35.760
This is big news.

02:46:36.800 --> 02:46:38.400
I just thought about it at the last second.

02:46:38.400 --> 02:46:43.840
But they had a Nest Maker panel also at PAX East, which I'd be curious to see how that

02:46:43.840 --> 02:46:44.320
went.

02:46:44.320 --> 02:46:45.200
Well, I hope it's on YouTube.

02:46:45.840 --> 02:46:47.040
Yeah, I hope so.

02:46:47.040 --> 02:46:47.920
I'd like to watch that.

02:46:47.920 --> 02:46:49.120
But yeah, it'd be fun.

02:46:49.120 --> 02:46:50.960
At least you'll be able to play the demo of the game.

02:46:50.960 --> 02:46:52.880
I don't think I didn't put the full game on there.

02:46:53.600 --> 02:46:58.960
Honestly, I would have made the full game available in the museum only, but there wasn't

02:46:58.960 --> 02:47:00.160
really a way to do that.

02:47:00.160 --> 02:47:02.480
But you have a demo version you can play at least.

02:47:02.480 --> 02:47:03.040
Yeah.

02:47:03.040 --> 02:47:04.000
Well, that's great.

02:47:04.000 --> 02:47:05.040
Congratulations on that.

02:47:05.040 --> 02:47:05.680
That's awesome.

02:47:06.400 --> 02:47:07.040
All right.

02:47:07.040 --> 02:47:08.480
But again, way to bury the lead.

02:47:08.480 --> 02:47:11.840
All right, let's go around.

02:47:11.840 --> 02:47:13.920
Let me quickly thank everybody for listening tonight.

02:47:13.920 --> 02:47:16.640
Thank you for tuning in to Orange Launch Radio and supporting this show.

02:47:16.640 --> 02:47:20.000
If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Launch Radio, please tell a friend or an AI

02:47:20.000 --> 02:47:21.280
chat bot about the show.

02:47:21.280 --> 02:47:24.320
Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we

02:47:24.320 --> 02:47:25.840
need more voices.

02:47:25.840 --> 02:47:27.440
Real humans only, please.

02:47:27.440 --> 02:47:34.880
To put out on air to chat with cats and dogs are acceptable, too, but mostly people and

02:47:34.880 --> 02:47:35.120
other.

02:47:36.080 --> 02:47:38.800
Then the bird fans going to email and be like, you left out bird.

02:47:38.800 --> 02:47:39.920
Okay, look, you know what I mean?

02:47:41.040 --> 02:47:42.320
Thank you so much for supporting.

02:47:42.320 --> 02:47:44.240
Tell a friend or two about the show.

02:47:44.240 --> 02:47:45.120
Help us spread the word.

02:47:46.080 --> 02:47:50.800
You know, a nice five star review on a site like iTunes, Spotify, wherever it is you found

02:47:50.800 --> 02:47:51.520
this show.

02:47:51.520 --> 02:47:52.800
That goes a long way.

02:47:52.800 --> 02:47:54.800
So we really appreciate all of that.

02:47:55.760 --> 02:47:56.320
That's that.

02:47:56.320 --> 02:47:58.160
Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

02:47:58.160 --> 02:48:04.000
Dark Sakura, I'm sure we're going to see you swiffing and whatever we say there.

02:48:05.120 --> 02:48:06.160
Swiffing and sliding.

02:48:06.160 --> 02:48:06.660
Yeah.

02:48:08.080 --> 02:48:09.840
Fixie and I will be co-streaming.

02:48:09.840 --> 02:48:10.340
Oh, fun.

02:48:11.060 --> 02:48:16.900
And I think we're going to have Shayla tonight and I have messaged Gwen.

02:48:16.900 --> 02:48:19.780
So team Yeet will be eating around.

02:48:19.780 --> 02:48:21.460
Maybe we'll actually do a yeet match.

02:48:22.580 --> 02:48:25.140
But yeah, and if I may make a mention of something else.

02:48:25.140 --> 02:48:27.700
Yeah, I'm having a subathon on my birthday.

02:48:28.660 --> 02:48:32.580
That's April 19th, starting at 10 a.m. Pacific time.

02:48:32.580 --> 02:48:38.020
And I'm going to try to go the full 24 hours because I'm brave and stupid.

02:48:38.740 --> 02:48:46.420
And if I can hit a total of 250 subs in my channel, I will bleach my hair on stream.

02:48:46.420 --> 02:48:47.620
Oh, that's a big goal.

02:48:47.620 --> 02:48:50.100
But that's on stream.

02:48:50.100 --> 02:48:51.220
That's a fun reward.

02:48:51.220 --> 02:48:54.500
So and then I will promptly re-dye it red.

02:48:56.180 --> 02:48:57.460
No, we'll see what happens.

02:48:57.460 --> 02:49:02.260
Maybe for additional ones, I'll add in another color.

02:49:03.540 --> 02:49:03.860
All right.

02:49:03.860 --> 02:49:04.660
We'll see what happens.

02:49:04.660 --> 02:49:07.140
No, I'm actually I've got full on platinum.

02:49:09.780 --> 02:49:12.740
Nutrisse brand and I have Olaplex.

02:49:12.740 --> 02:49:14.980
I have the stuff to do it and do it safely.

02:49:14.980 --> 02:49:20.340
So if I get hot roots, that's just more incentive to re-dye it.

02:49:20.340 --> 02:49:20.980
We'll see what happens.

02:49:20.980 --> 02:49:23.220
I doubt I'm going to get it, but who knows?

02:49:23.220 --> 02:49:24.020
You never know.

02:49:24.020 --> 02:49:25.380
Got to be ready for it.

02:49:25.380 --> 02:49:28.580
And I might play nurse if I get 150.

02:49:28.580 --> 02:49:29.460
All right.

02:49:29.460 --> 02:49:29.780
All right.

02:49:29.780 --> 02:49:30.820
Well, have a good stream tonight.

02:49:30.820 --> 02:49:31.320
We'll see you.

02:49:31.940 --> 02:49:32.340
Thank you.

02:49:32.340 --> 02:49:32.820
Bye.

02:49:32.820 --> 02:49:33.320
Bye.

02:49:33.720 --> 02:49:34.280
All right.

02:49:34.280 --> 02:49:35.400
Loki, that means it's over to you.

02:49:35.400 --> 02:49:37.080
What's your final thought for tonight?

02:49:37.080 --> 02:49:42.080
A new episode should be out this week featuring Axolotl

02:49:42.080 --> 02:49:43.800
women's area.

02:49:43.800 --> 02:49:45.320
It's pretty amazing.

02:49:45.320 --> 02:49:46.760
Can't wait for you to see it.

02:49:46.760 --> 02:49:47.260
All right.

02:49:48.840 --> 02:49:52.040
I haven't been streaming a lot this week because of all

02:49:52.040 --> 02:49:54.280
the cat drama I talked about earlier in the show.

02:49:54.280 --> 02:49:58.760
And now my husband's in Twitch jail, but I should be streaming

02:49:58.760 --> 02:50:00.840
on my personal channel at some point this week.

02:50:00.840 --> 02:50:03.320
I actually don't terribly know what I'm going to play next.

02:50:03.320 --> 02:50:06.520
I've been toying with the idea of going back to the older

02:50:06.520 --> 02:50:07.240
Pokemon game.

02:50:07.240 --> 02:50:10.040
Well, not that old, but the Pokemon games I never finished,

02:50:10.040 --> 02:50:12.040
especially now that home integration is included.

02:50:12.040 --> 02:50:15.240
I kind of am itching to go back and play Pokemon Arceus.

02:50:16.440 --> 02:50:18.120
I don't know if y'all in chat would be interested in that,

02:50:18.120 --> 02:50:18.840
but give me a shout.

02:50:18.840 --> 02:50:20.920
If you want me to check out Pokemon Arceus.

02:50:21.720 --> 02:50:25.320
I'm also at some point I'll pick up Pokemon Scarlet as well,

02:50:25.320 --> 02:50:27.800
but I'm just for some reason I'm really itching on Arceus.

02:50:27.800 --> 02:50:28.360
I don't know why.

02:50:28.360 --> 02:50:29.000
Like that one.

02:50:29.000 --> 02:50:30.680
I'm like, why didn't I finish that game?

02:50:31.240 --> 02:50:35.000
But now that the home integration is there too, I love

02:50:35.000 --> 02:50:37.480
doing the little mini collection quests and building my

02:50:37.480 --> 02:50:40.280
ultimate Pokemon collection and home.

02:50:40.280 --> 02:50:41.720
I'm kind of down for that.

02:50:41.720 --> 02:50:42.120
So all right.

02:50:42.120 --> 02:50:43.480
Well, thank you for all the kind love in chat.

02:50:43.480 --> 02:50:44.920
Maybe that is something I will do.

02:50:44.920 --> 02:50:48.280
I got to do something to hold me over until June when Diablo

02:50:48.280 --> 02:50:51.000
Fantasy 16, all this stuff comes out.

02:50:51.000 --> 02:50:53.400
So yeah, get some games to hold us over.

02:50:53.400 --> 02:50:53.900
All right.

02:50:54.760 --> 02:50:57.800
Thank you again, everyone, for supporting Orange Mountains

02:50:57.800 --> 02:50:58.840
Radio and our podcast.

02:50:58.840 --> 02:51:00.280
We really appreciate you all.

02:51:00.280 --> 02:51:02.600
953 weeks and counting.

02:51:02.600 --> 02:51:04.760
And I can't wait to see you all in seven days.

02:51:04.760 --> 02:51:05.400
We'll do it again.

02:51:05.400 --> 02:51:06.680
Have a great week, everyone.

02:51:06.680 --> 02:51:07.180
Good night.

02:51:30.280 --> 02:51:33.400
They reflect those of the staff of Orange Lounge Radio nor

02:51:33.400 --> 02:51:36.200
Fog Network, but you know, they were all still.

02:52:00.280 --> 02:52:05.280
Bye.
