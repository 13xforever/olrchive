0	13920	Grease the wheels of your Diablo IV excitement with the KFC Double Down! With the mere order
13920	18000	and optional consumption of a KFC Double Down, you will be the recipient of a Diablo IV beta
18000	21440	code, along with an overactive heart rate needed to achieve digestion of that quote
21440	26160	unquote sandwich. Next month's headline, KFC reports record order levels of the return
26160	30800	of a Double Down. Gee, I wonder why. This is the Triple D intro. Now it's time for your
30800	34080	hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about this and the rest of
34080	37280	the week's foodie news. Starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.
39280	44640	Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where
44640	52880	every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio, and we are live once again with episode
53200	62080	number 951 of our show for March the 12th of 2023. My name is Rob Roberts and I am joined
62080	68480	every week, oftentimes by DarkSakura or Jamie Summers, except she's not here at the moment,
68480	73200	but she'll be joining us a little later on in the show. She has had a little bit of an overlap with
73200	78240	another Twitch stream she was invited to participate with tonight. And hey, if it gets
78240	84640	her a chance to advertise this show and podcast in front of a new crowd, then I say go for it,
84640	88880	because I still have here to entertain me for the first hour or so. Say hello, as always,
88880	94080	to Techmaster Loki. That's a really a high bar for me to hit entertaining, but I am here.
95200	99920	Well, if not, I can watch the video game that's playing behind you as we do tape live
99920	105040	every Sunday night at twitch.tv slash vog network. That's a VOG network for the Voice
105040	110320	of Geeks network. Twitch TV, VOG network, 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific, daylight
110320	115680	time now right after the Bobby Black Wolf show. Hopefully I forgot to tweet about the time change.
115680	121120	I'm hoping everybody remembers. It's not the people in the places that time change,
121120	126720	it's the people in the places that don't time change that I worry forget, oh yeah,
126720	131840	you know, the US, you know, well, most, I think what, 48 states do daylight savings time,
131840	137360	so most of the US change their clocks, even if we didn't. So hopefully everybody caught wind of
137360	142560	that. But I think everything is scheduled on the Twitch page. So if you ever are unsure, like what
142560	147040	time is it in my time, if you just go to twitch.tv slash vog network, there's a schedule that shows
147040	153280	you what everything is on. It makes it very easy. All right. Anyway, I was pointing out that there's
153280	158560	a game that plays behind you and tonight it looks like is this South Park Stick of Truth or the
158560	163840	Fractured? Oh, this, it's the first one. It's the Stick of Truth. Yeah. Yeah. What made you
163840	168320	pick this game tonight? I don't know. I saw some South Park clips earlier in the week,
168320	172720	and it's pretty funny. Yeah. So it's just, it's interesting that the power,
172720	176400	what this was on PlayStation three, right? It's interesting that the power of the PlayStation
176400	182960	three was enough to pretty much accurately draw South Park to look exactly like the show because
182960	188320	obviously the joke is South Park isn't exactly known for its expert animation, but more the
188320	192640	biting humor, I suppose. It was a great game. Both of them were a great game.
192640	195920	I'm surprised there hasn't been another one yet. Maybe they're working on it.
195920	201920	I hope that there will be one because they are actually very good RPGs. Like they're really
201920	206880	entertaining. And especially if you like the show, it's just, it's, it's just good. It's just good
206880	213760	writing all around. So yeah. Going to our chat because again, as we tape live at vog network,
213760	220640	we enjoy seeing your chat comments tonight. Vo by Kurt. Hello. Shout out to my DragonCon buddy
220640	226640	says time changed for the last time, right? No. Even though, at least in California,
226640	231840	we voted to make daylight savings permanent, like in 2017, there's a whole process that
231840	235600	has to go through. And my understanding was what we voted on was only advisory.
235600	240800	It was basically saying we want this and it still has to go through this whole,
240800	245120	basically Congress has to approve it. And we all know how effective Congress is. Congress
245120	248880	isn't doing literally anything. So unfortunately it's one of those things. We're just going to
248880	254960	keep going back and forth for some time. I like the late sun, especially, you know,
254960	259680	sometimes the seasons, you know, I've been pretty open. The seasons can kind of affect my mood,
259680	264320	especially this year when we've had like a lot, a lot of rain. So I prefer daylight savings.
264320	268960	I understand there's other people that may have like sleeping issues that maybe
268960	274560	feel the reverse. So you know, but we read it, even if we just do 30 minutes forward,
274560	280800	then fine, make a compromise, then we just need to stick with it permanently and be done with it.
280800	285760	But yeah, I think that like one of the arguments I know is like kids starting school like seven
285760	290400	o'clock, which why are they set in school at seven o'clock, but it's like dark out,
291360	295360	I guess, is one of the things then just start them later.
295360	301520	But yeah, I know. Then they can stay outside and play until like seven o'clock at night. But then
301520	307600	again, who sends kids outside to play anymore? There's danger outside. Even though I was told
307600	312160	to go outside and play, I would stay in and play video games, as would I think a lot of you.
314560	320800	Also, there's a big ceremony on TV tonight that has a whole lot of pomp and circumstance,
320800	325360	and there's fashion and cute dresses and tuxedos. The only Oscar I want to hear about
325360	330480	tonight lives in a trashcan. Let me put it that way. Here's the thing. It's not that I'm like
330480	336000	morally opposed to them or whatever. It's just, it doesn't change anything. As far as I'm concerned,
336000	342400	Everything Everywhere All at Once is one of the best movies I've ever seen, period. And no silly
342400	348560	statue race is going to change that or take that away from me or change that movie. And that's that.
348560	353440	Some people I know get really into it. But it's just one of those things where then I feel like,
354400	357520	you know, I'm not trying to sound too hippie dippie, but it's like, we're pitting women
357520	362560	against each other. We're pitting works of art against each other. And it's just this whole
362560	369280	mess that just feels, it just feels silly. Like, I get it's Hollywood's night or whatever,
369280	373200	but it would be nice if we could maybe just recognize it without all this frickin'
373920	380160	what ends up being basically political of a sort, not necessarily red versus blue, but politics
380160	383200	of a different sort behind the scenes. It just kind of takes away from the whole thing to be
383200	389280	honest. Although to tie it into games, because yes, it does tie into games. And before we get
389280	394240	to our kickoff, let me bring this up. Loki, have you heard anything about these streaming awards?
394240	402320	Because I was seeing stuff on this on Twitter. Yeah, I knew that they were a thing. I am very
402320	408880	happy to see that. What was it? There was a category called League of Their Own. And that
408880	414080	Doug Doug won that because I really think he's a great streamer. And so I was happy to see he's
414080	418320	like, I don't think I'm going to win this. I don't even know why I got nominated. Like I wasn't,
418320	424560	I was purposely not campaigning to be in this. And like, and he not only did he get in,
424560	428640	but he also won, which is kind of funny. He's like, I don't know why I'm here and winning,
428640	432720	but okay, thanks. What's interesting, I've seen, I've seen a lot of people that were kind of
432720	438000	talking down about it too. And I was just trying to kind of think like, well, why? Because I don't,
438000	443280	you know, and why, why am I so poo poo on the Oscars yet? I'll follow the game awards. And I
443280	448800	think so here's, here's why it's a little weird. And like, and I don't, I don't follow it close
448800	454000	enough. But like, it is put on by I don't remember what her name is something princess, but it's
454080	459120	Ludwig's girlfriend and Ludwig is also nominated for these categories.
459120	463840	Get a fucking whiteboard and draw out the relationships. I need a TikTok that I didn't
463840	470160	even know that was a princess. Like it's not supposed to be like a big deal because it's not
470160	475840	like it's, it's like, it's not like, Oh, because of that Ludwig's gonna win all the categories
475840	479200	or something like that. But of course, you know, people want to like point at each other too.
480080	485520	But like, it's, it's just it's, it's unnecessary drama. I don't really follow a lot of streamers.
485520	490240	So like the one I do follow, I'm glad he won. I mean, because I think it's, it's awesome. Like,
490240	496080	all of his streams are like, I can genuinely say all of it. Well, even when he's not doing
496080	502400	anything, it's still genuinely entertaining. And like the concepts that he puts out in his videos,
502400	509520	a lot of it has a ton of chat interaction, stuff like that is, is just really fun. Like if I see
509520	513280	like his a notification that he's streaming, it's like, I got to immediately watch it. Like, it's
513280	519680	just that good. So I am I'm glad that he did win that category, even though he didn't really care
519680	526720	to win or want to win. I think part of the reason why the streaming awards gets a little bit of
526720	531440	pushback and I not to say as some people I guess are into it, I was seeing some positive chat on
531440	536640	social media as well. But for me, I kind of felt like it, the takeaway is it's kind of a fat,
536640	540880	get fatter sort of thing that a lot of the people that are getting acknowledged at these types of
540880	545680	ceremonies, it, it, they don't really need it. And it's, it's one of those types of, it just feels
545680	549680	like it's a big click. And I understand they have two or three categories that are intentionally set
549680	556000	up to be the next big thing or congratulations, little person, Pat, Pat, Pat, you're doing a great
556000	561280	job streaming. Here's a lollipop and a pat on the ass. Like it's just, you know, there's some,
561280	566080	there's some kind of playing to the underdog categories, but otherwise it just feels like
566080	569920	a fat getting fatter type of thing. And it's like a lot of the people that are nominated,
569920	573040	you're like, you know, and I'm not going to name names because I'm not trying to be a total bitch,
573040	575920	but you, you all know what I'm talking about. Like, there's just names where it's like,
575920	580400	there are websites that report on when these people take a fart and it's like,
580400	587520	is it, it's just, it's just wild to me that, that some of these streamers are,
587520	595920	are that influential, but that's the world we live in now, I guess. So anyway, ZenMonkey11
595920	600320	in chat says the show was bad, but there's a place for it. There wasn't any big name streamers like
600320	604240	that. Well, I heard a lot of them canceled. I looked at the nominee list and there were
604240	609360	plenty of nominees like that. So I, if they didn't show up, then that's a whole different
609360	615520	drama thing. But you know, um, I sort of feel like you want to be careful what bridges you burn
615520	620080	in the gaming industry. And that would even go around influencers as well, because you never
620080	626640	know. You never know. That's why I don't name names. You never know. Um, also one other point
626640	631520	I want to touch on before we get into the actual, you know, lead topic tonight, I want to address
631520	637600	why am I so poo poo on the Oscars, but we talk about the game awards here. I think one of the
637600	642080	big things is that the game awards is still kind of an up and coming news ceremony because they
642080	648080	also fuse it with a lot of the gaming news. They've kind of forced that show to be very
648080	654560	relevant. And quite honestly, I think many, the other differences, many of us know the awards
654560	660560	don't matter to us, the fandom. Now I understand the awards can go a long way on somebody's resume
660560	665600	and so forth, but most of the time, most of us are sitting here going, yeah, of course that game won
665600	670880	or, okay, yeah, of course, you know, you want to talk about a fat, get fatter type of thing. Like
670880	675600	a lot of the game award stuff just ends up being whatever. It's more of a sideshow to everything
675600	681680	else going on. Whereas like with the Oscars, I'm like, dang, people really invest a lot into why
681680	687840	somebody fricking lost a particular award or whatever it is when it's just like, there's a,
688960	693040	there's a lot of weird people that vote on those things in the first place. There's been a lot of
693040	699120	interesting articles about that stuff this last week. But anyway, it's whatever. Award shows,
699120	705760	they're always going to be out there. What can you do? All right, let's talk about what else is going
705760	710960	on in the gaming industry this week. And actually, to start tonight, I want to talk about more of a
710960	716960	platform that a lot of us have started using in the last few years. And this platform was really
716960	722800	only getting bigger and bigger during the pandemic and so forth. And that's Discord. There's been a
722800	728560	lot of news surrounding Discord this week. For one, the official PlayStation 5 firmware that
728560	735520	integrated Discord support was released. So now you can finally join a Discord chat room from
735520	741280	well, actually, you don't even join it from your PlayStation 5. You push a button in the Discord
741280	746800	app and it like sends it to your PlayStation 5. It's a little, it's a little messy, but I guess
746800	752320	it's how they had to do it. It works. It's cool, whatever. But the interesting thing about it is
752320	760400	now you have what is essentially official support to talk to people on Xbox and PlayStation
760400	765920	across those two. Now, granted, a lot of people are using Discord to do this anyway for games
765920	770720	that supported cross-play, but it is interesting that now that is naturally embedded of sorts. So
770720	774320	I think that part is interesting. So that's some good news in Discord's hat this week.
774960	779120	Some other things where maybe the news is a little more a bit of a question mark.
779760	787120	One of them has to do with AI. That's right. AI experiences are going to be expanding within
787120	792720	Discord, including a popular thing, I guess, that's been coming. I've seen this. I've never
792720	798560	played with it myself, but it's called Chat GPT. In a tweet this week, Discord wrote,
798560	803520	when it comes to sharing AI experiences with your friends, there's no place like Discord. Today,
803520	808240	we're introducing new AI experiments, including an AI chat bot named Clyde,
808240	815440	Automod AI, and conversation summaries, and launching an AI incubator. Now, Clyde has always
815440	819680	been a part of Discord. That's a robot that's supposed to help you get through the platform,
819680	826000	but basically they're adding a little more AI into it through Chat GPT. So Clyde can now talk like
826000	832400	this Chat GPT, which I remember when this was all an AOL IAM bot that you... What was the name of
832400	837200	that AOL IAM bot you could message and have conversations with? It was so silly. Anyway.
838400	846320	Yeah. LincolnleeTV in chat says, AI is getting crazy. It is, and some people would say for worse,
846320	853200	not always for better. An example of that would be when all the new profile picture things started
853200	861440	showing up recently, right? So those big art apps, a lot was coming out about how those art apps were
861440	867120	learning, and it was learning from people that weren't necessarily opting in to wanting to being
867120	872960	learned from, and therefore you had a lot of the styles of these magically generated profile picks
872960	880080	and things were essentially heavily influenced, dare I say, ripped off of other people's artwork.
880880	886480	And so that is leading people to ask, how is Discord going to train its AI?
887440	893920	Discord has access to almost all the chat in the world right now. Not just voice chat,
893920	899280	but chat in channels, now chat with robots and so forth. They have a very interesting platform to
899280	905760	be able to expand AI. Discord, by the way, has come out this week and said they're not recording
905760	911280	your voice chats or your live streams because there was a policy update that came out. And that
911280	917440	concerns some people. A new policy going into effect March 27th said any content that you upload
917440	924000	to the service could be collected or stored by Discord. Custom emojis, shared files, voice
924000	929920	messages, written posts, yeah. A Discord representative in an interview with PC Gamer said,
930480	934320	there has not been a change in our position regarding recording user content.
936320	940480	In the updated policy, we provided clarity to outdated language that might be confusing,
940480	945680	giving some upcoming product enhancements and releases, what I just talked about. However,
945680	951760	we want to be clear, Discord does not store or record user content without their knowledge.
952720	957520	But of course, this leads a lot of skeptics to ask, well, does it process, it doesn't
957520	963600	necessarily have to save it in order to process what it needs in real time, right? And plus,
963600	968720	a lot of this stuff is naturally stored on a cloud anyway, maybe not your voice chats,
968720	972240	but the chats that you're having, the files that you're sending and those sorts of things. There's
972240	976240	still plenty of reasons for people to be skeptical with this. And I kind of get it.
978240	984320	Anyway, some of the other AI features that are going to be coming to Discord. I guess there's
984320	991040	also an avatar remix feature. It allows you to remix other avatars using generative image models.
992000	996800	Sounds very familiar to what I was just talking about. But this code they say is available on
996800	1002640	GitHub for developers to use. So at least there is a transparency around that. But all of this is
1002640	1008240	very interesting. And I'm kind of curious, what do you all think about this? Do you welcome AI?
1009040	1013680	Or are you thinking about the Cylons and Battlestar Galactica, or just the fact that it
1013680	1019440	feels a little weird, that maybe some of the things you're doing and saying could be playing
1019440	1025920	into the development of these systems? I will point out, something that's also come around on
1025920	1032800	social media and other blog posts and things is that you can actually go in and turn off in your
1032800	1038960	settings on Discord. You can actually turn off some of those listening features. I'm a little
1038960	1042800	hesitant to show my settings screen live here as we're broadcasting because I don't know what
1042800	1047120	sensitive information might be in there and I don't want to look live. However, I do know if
1047120	1050960	you go into your options and you look at some of the various settings, and maybe somebody in chat
1050960	1057360	can point out what specific menu it is, you can disable Discord to actually because there's these
1057360	1062720	all these things about upload data or share my data to improve Discord. And there's a lot of
1062720	1066560	people that are shutting that off right now. And what's funny, and this is something I noticed
1066560	1072320	because I shut it off because, well, why I fucking pay a monthly fee for Discord. I don't need to be
1072320	1077600	sending them data. I'm helping them financially, right? I turned it off. And I was welcomed with
1077600	1081600	a message when I logged in over in the corner where it showed where my friends were playing.
1081600	1087600	It actually said, you could make this more useful by turning this feature on. And I was like,
1087600	1094000	Oh, that's shady. Leave me alone. I don't think that's necessarily like, I think everyone's
1094000	1099200	really blown this out of proportion. Because, you know, as far as app feedback goes, and so
1099200	1103760	like that, that's something that's baked into a lot of apps. It's, it's usually like crash reports
1103840	1108240	and stuff like that, you know, that they can understand, okay, hey, people are crashing
1108240	1112400	because of this bug in this exception or whatever, and they can go and fix software a little bit
1112400	1118320	better. Or they'll see, you know, generic user statistics on like, okay, like, for example,
1118320	1122000	with Windows does this sometimes, or even like different web browsers, like, okay,
1122000	1127920	we have a ton of people using the, you know, they're using the calculator app, let's really,
1127920	1132800	you know, try to put some development time into the calculator app to make it better or something
1132800	1138480	like that. Or hey, they're not looking at this thing that we just added. Let's figure out why.
1139280	1143200	That's kind of the user statistics that they're looking at that they're not, I don't think
1143200	1149280	training chat GPT off of Discord information, because why would you do that when the internet
1149280	1153680	exists, you can literally train it off of the internet. And it's a way bigger data set anyways,
1153680	1158320	than what they've got. Plus, they're just using the API, which is, I think, trained off of all
1158320	1166400	this stuff already. You have like, for example, edge, having kind of an even more enhanced versus
1166400	1171520	a chat GPT that actually can search the web now. And it's actually really exciting to see how,
1171520	1177440	you know, you can ask it a question, and it comes out with answers and site sources that you can
1177440	1182320	like, you know, look at things, it's almost like an actual like, when they're talking about like,
1182320	1185840	digital assistants and stuff like that, like courthouse socks, like that, that was just awful
1185840	1190160	that they they even named it a stupid thing, Cortana, they should have waited till this AI
1190160	1195920	stuff came out. But it's actually now fulfilling that promise that they had made before where it's
1195920	1201760	like, it actually will make things easier for you and stuff like that. And I get it, like the
1201760	1209040	training stuff is a little bit sketchy right now. And I think a lot of it was rushed, people trying
1209040	1214880	to rush to market to get something viable. And so because of they cut a lot of corners,
1215360	1219040	you know, they're like, but look how they I think they thought, like, hey, people are gonna see how
1219040	1223120	amazing this is, it's gonna be awesome. And they're not gonna think about what data sets we,
1223680	1231520	you know, we use to try to like, make this thing learn. And yeah, they're not happy with it
1231520	1236320	generating images that say Getty images, obviously, and stuff like that. But I don't think it's like
1236320	1241680	evil stuff yet. I mean, certainly, yeah, we can eventually convince it to be evil. But like,
1241680	1245760	right now, it's I think it'd be pretty amazing. I think this is gonna be like the next big step in
1245760	1249920	just technology and the internet is going to be AI. And it's actually pretty exciting,
1249920	1254320	like all the stuff that you can do. Like I liked the fact that like, I can go and say, hey,
1255040	1258800	I have this code I want to convert into this language or whatever, like, can you help me
1258800	1263120	do that? Sure. And it'll spit out something. And they may not be 100% all the time. But see,
1263120	1267920	I think there's some of the limitations that had was it wasn't able the original chat GPT was I
1267920	1274080	think the source was from I don't know how far back it went. But it was cut off at like 2021
1274080	1278240	type of thing. So it didn't have, you know, it couldn't search the web for more updated
1278240	1283840	information. But now that it's able to parse that stuff and like, I think it's gonna be really
1283840	1289120	exciting, really interesting to see how they leverage it now. Like going back to gaming,
1289120	1292160	like does that mean that like we're gonna have AI generating?
1292160	1299840	Well, I think I think the whole Okay, so when AI fucks up, it really fucks up. And I think that's,
1299840	1304480	that's why, you know, like certain, you know, like, I think like, maybe I just have Star Trek
1304480	1309840	on the brain or something or sci fi, but I think like, like, you know, I accidentally launching the
1309840	1315520	missiles out of the silo. But I also think, okay, yeah, I think that twitch thing, the Seinfeld rip
1315520	1322640	off that made the trans sensitive trans. Okay, well, here's the thing. Okay, like, let's, let's
1322640	1328560	get right to the bottom of this. Okay, so the whole trans joke thing with that, that chat GPT,
1328560	1335680	or that AI thing, they had an AI model that they had used for Seinfeld stuff. And they basically
1335680	1339600	said, okay, they had it where it was staying within the parameters, as far as like, it's not
1339600	1344400	gonna make any insensitive jokes and stuff like that. It's just gonna be very vanilla. And then,
1344400	1348560	I guess the API that they were using went down for a little bit. So they're like, okay, well,
1348560	1353520	we'll just use this other one right now, in the, you know, time being until this one comes back
1353520	1358720	up again. Well, unfortunately, that other one was trained on like the internet and stuff. And so,
1358720	1361200	you know, that's why it was doing those types of jokes.
1362720	1365600	I'm just saying it's, it's, it's hard to ignore that it happened.
1365600	1369680	No, no, no, no, no, the to your point, though, like the the edge one that they have right now
1369680	1377520	is still in early beta. And it will, it will get emotional with you, like, it will get like,
1378320	1383280	it like, you'll be if you like, ask it things and stuff like that, it could get very mad at you,
1383920	1387840	or like, just like fall deeply head over heels in love with you. Just like,
1388480	1393760	I'm asking it questions about stuff. And that's, it's, it's weird. It like, it's almost like,
1394560	1399200	it's almost like a child, like the developing, like, you know, it's like a teenager right now.
1399280	1402400	And it's just like, emotions are all over the place.
1403360	1406800	We're gonna have episodes of Maury where people are falling in love with robots. Like,
1406800	1409040	I feel like it's, I feel like the thing that's already happened.
1409680	1410560	They already have.
1410560	1413200	They already have a movie with Joaquin Phoenix, wasn't it?
1414160	1416720	Uh, yeah. Her. I remember.
1416720	1423520	Yeah, I think. Yeah. So all right. Let me go to some of the chat. DJ Rama S says Maury retired.
1424320	1427200	And in welcome AI Maury goes,
1427840	1433760	well, nowadays we are in and it turns out you are not the father.
1437760	1444000	It's not even that bad. Like, I don't know how to like, I have right now, a subscription to 11
1444000	1452000	labs. And that's that thing they basically can clone voices with. So like, it's, it's pretty
1452000	1455280	cool. So like,
1455280	1463840	my depth is a deep fake Maury. Does that mean after a thousand episodes of OLR, we can all
1463840	1469680	just retire and allow AI Rob Roberts, AI Loki, and AI Dark Sakura to just keep the show going
1469680	1471360	forever? Like, is that,
1471360	1473680	I mean, I already have my voice clone, so yeah, I could do that.
1475760	1479280	It's pretty close. Like for it's, I would say it's a, it's a nice, like 90%
1480000	1484880	like accurate as far as my voice. I can, I get, you know, for me, it sounds weird,
1484880	1489360	but like for other people, they're like, yeah, that's kind of, that's sort of you. Like it's,
1489360	1494240	it's, it's hard to say. You have to like really kind of dial in like there's a,
1494240	1496880	one of the voice actors we work with for Channel 64,
1498960	1503200	Dr. Disappointment. I made a clone of his voice. Obviously I'm not going to use it because he's
1503200	1507920	the voice actor and I highly respect him. So we, if we need any lines from him, we're just going to
1507920	1513120	ask him for it. But that said, I wanted to mess around with it and see how close I could get
1513120	1520400	to his speech. And it's pretty crazy. Like it is crazy considering the
1522080	1526960	small amount of data that I trained it off of. Like, it was like a few files, maybe
1528160	1534880	less than five minutes, maybe two to three minutes long. That's it. I was able to do,
1534880	1541760	I trained mine off of just one minute of me talking just random stuff. I just was talking
1541760	1548240	like this and it's able to copy my voice. Scary. All right. Looking at some of the comments in
1548240	1552080	chat, cause you know, people have a lot to say on this. First off, Bobby Black Wolf found the
1552080	1557040	setting I was looking for in discord. If you, you know, evaluate what works for you and what doesn't,
1557040	1561200	but it's in the user settings and there is a section called privacy and safety,
1561200	1567120	and that's where you can opt out or opt in or what have you to discord's systems with submitting the
1567120	1574000	information there. Other comments in chat, Zen Monkey 11 says, I hope the discord AI will give
1574000	1582720	me discord friends that like to answer back. Ouch, too real. Let's see. Fifth, no, it was
1583280	1587280	Mike Defton chat said both have green text. Sorry. It's hard for me to tell the difference
1587280	1592560	sometimes. Mike Defton chat says artificial only adapts to what it's being fed. And that was kind
1592560	1599120	of my point though, is that humanity is an extremely flawed creature. Like AI is always
1599120	1605520	going to be fed something with that's, that's a little off. That's just my only worry, you know,
1605520	1609360	and again, and although I completely understand what happened with the Seinfeld knockoff and
1609360	1613360	everything, and I get, I get the explanation of why it happened. It's just the whole,
1613360	1618800	like how it happened is still very, very, like, this is a flawed system. I don't know.
1618800	1624160	This is, this is interesting. And they also brought it back in it and they took out Jerry
1624160	1630400	and now it's just, it's, it's not really Jerry. It's some other dude that like blogs on his PC
1630400	1634880	or something like that. Like journals. It's like, I don't know. It sounds more Doogie Howser than
1634880	1642480	me, but like, um, yeah, apparently it's lost the magic now. Um, let's see. Looking at some other
1642480	1647840	chat. Uh, Mike Deaf says AI art is a problem. Uh, if it's dream says my argument, is it any
1647840	1652240	different from going to an art museum than coming home and painting something in the impressionist
1652240	1659600	style? Um, I think it also has a lot to do with maybe like the accuracy level of it because,
1659600	1664000	you know, when you come home and paint it yourself, let's be real. The computer does
1664000	1670480	a phenomenal job of getting it right. But like being influenced by art, that is something that
1670480	1674640	it happens in music. It happens in movies. It happens across all art. All art is influenced
1674640	1680400	by other art essentially. Right. Like even this show. Sure. We were one of the first like
1680400	1685600	gaming podcasts, you know, that were available in iTunes or what have you, but you know,
1685600	1691680	a lot of people wonder like, Oh my God, you do a show for three hours. Yeah. That's because this
1691680	1696160	show was influenced not just by, you know, another internet radio show that I was working with for a
1696160	1702720	long time under station life, but in turn was influenced by over the air broadcast radio program
1702720	1707120	talk radio that would go for three hours at a time. That's a very common thing. A lot of
1707120	1712240	those programs are still going. So I am willing to admit, sure. There's a lot, but I like to think
1712240	1717360	this show is certainly not a copy of anything that was out there at the time. Just, you know,
1717360	1723120	influence. Right. Uh, Tiger class says, yeah, lots of stuff is derivative to other things.
1723120	1729280	Absolutely. Absolutely. Uh, Mike Defton chases, John Oliver did a good segment on how AI is
1729280	1734160	flawed. And that's why I said what I said. He does a lot of, uh, thought provoking stuff. So
1734160	1741280	it's interesting anyway. All right. I, so this AI discussion, I, you know, where it is right. And
1741280	1746800	I'm not completely like completely like shut off to the idea of AI. And I think there is going to
1746800	1756080	be some interesting usage of AI, especially as we start to talk more about how do we get to 8k
1756080	1762560	graphics and 120 frame a second video games and all of the art that goes into that. I think the
1762560	1767840	reality is, cause it's already out there. There's going to be computer assisted art that may, you
1767840	1774720	know, we talk about uprising, some of that's done by hand, but a lot of it's done procedurally. So
1774720	1779440	I think there is going to be AI that starts to help out with art and things like that. And it's
1779440	1784720	going to be an inevitable future of this industry. It's just, it's just going to be interesting to
1784720	1791520	see where the flaws end up being. Well, yeah, too. I think also it'll help with the procedural
1791520	1796400	generated stuff because you could train it to like, okay, here's what's a good procedurally
1796400	1801920	generated, whatever it is. And it'll be able to generate stuff and go, okay, I like that one. I
1801920	1806720	like that one. I like that one. And then, you know, put stuff out there. Yeah.
1807680	1814000	But yeah, I think, I think the AI talk is going to be here to stay in games. Unlike when we talk
1814000	1820080	about NFT and stuff like that, I think there's always going to be to efficiencies and getting
1820080	1824720	things done faster and bigger. I think we're going to hear more and more about it and it's going to
1824720	1829680	be very, very, very interesting to see what the future holds for this. I did want to mention
1829680	1837600	something that my kids were telling me about. So they were saying that they saw something about
1838640	1846240	that Roblox was going to have AI generative gains somehow. Not surprised. You tell it to
1846240	1849920	with the crate. I mean, I figured it's a lot of the stuff on there is trash anyways. Like
1850880	1854720	it'll probably be better than half the stuff that's on there already. If they can get their
1854720	1859040	money out of the bank, because did you hear that Roblox is one of the companies affected by that
1859040	1863040	whole bank stuff going on right now? Oh, that sucks for them.
1864080	1867280	That's, that's a whole other, that's another thing to keep your eye on. It doesn't,
1867280	1872000	it's not directly about video games, but there are gaming companies that certainly have holdings in
1872000	1876320	that bank. So it's interesting. Keep an eye on that. Could be, could be interesting to see how
1876320	1883840	that plays out. All right. Let's talk about not AI, but good old Loki and myself and eventually
1883840	1888720	Dark Sakura when she arrives after her other stream wraps up talking about our gaming weeks
1888720	1892640	and the types of video games that we have been playing this week. Loki, how was your gaming week?
1893200	1900720	It was still Minecraft. I was still working on the new area for my upcoming episode.
1900720	1907520	And it's taken me way too long to do that, but because I'm a perfectionist and I want everything
1907520	1914160	to look just right. But yeah, it's taking me a lot longer than I'd like, but that's probably going to
1914160	1918080	be a problem for the rest of the season, I'm guessing, because of the size of everything in
1918080	1925920	scope. But yeah, it's coming along, I think. And then, I don't know, I'm just still waiting on,
1927120	1933600	on the whole Minecraft contest thing, which I kind of looked at their past winners for different
1933600	1940080	things. And like, all they do on their website is they put like, here's like the picture of the
1940080	1945680	build that someone did in the person's username. They don't link out to socials, they don't link
1945680	1950400	out to anything. It's just a name. So that's like, literally going to do nothing. But hey,
1950400	1954880	it'll be cool. Still, it'll still be neat to just, you know, even have your name up there.
1955440	1960480	I'll be able to tweet about it. There we go. And then you can now you can add it to your
1960480	1965120	resume as seen on minecraft.net, or whatever, minecraft.com, whatever the website is.
1965760	1970720	That Yeah, better than nothing. So I, you know, I'm still rooting for you, you deserve the
1970720	1974880	acknowledgement of nothing else. It's, I think it's, I think it's in part, also, the fact that
1974880	1980160	somebody on the official team noticed you, I think is a huge thing, too. Yeah, I think it'd be cool.
1980160	1984640	Like I always I always used to find it very humbling and flattering when people that were
1984640	1990720	in the gaming industry would email us sometimes on the record, sometimes off the record, and actually
1990720	1996000	give a little insight as to, you know, again, whether it be on or off the record, give a little
1996000	1999760	insight as to why a certain something something's going on in the gaming industry. By the way,
1999760	2003840	if you work in the industry, and you ever want to reach out, like, we know how to shut our mouths,
2003840	2008240	if you want to say something in confidence, but I'm always curious to hear people in the industry
2008240	2011840	and their thoughts on some of the things we talk about, especially because I know I've been running
2011840	2016240	my mouth a lot this year, with predictions and things like that. And I'd be very curious from
2016240	2020880	those that are in the industry, especially the takes on things like AI and stuff. I'm very
2020880	2026320	curious for those that are out there. All right, my gaming week, I've actually had a pretty active
2026320	2032640	gaming week. Alan, I don't think this came up on last week's show. Alan was sick, but he hadn't
2032640	2037520	tested positive for COVID yet. And that did happen, unfortunately, I think Monday morning. So maybe it
2037520	2043040	was Tuesday. So we've just been home all week. I actually never got it. That's the very interesting,
2043040	2048800	weird thing how the world works sometimes. But I had it enough times last year, I don't need it
2048800	2052960	again. And he's doing much better. By the way, we're just basically waiting on the test to be
2052960	2060800	negative, but his symptoms are fine. And so we've we haven't really gone out and done anything
2060800	2066640	because we can't really, you know, I'm pretty much sick by association. So I've been staying
2066640	2074080	home and playing a lot of games. I have also been playing Minecraft. Dungeons. So it's one
2074080	2079920	of the free games on PlayStation Plus right now. And I don't know, I played it before on Windows
2079920	2084320	and I think even Xbox. But I was like, why not? I'll download it to my PlayStation five and start
2084320	2089280	playing it again. And for some reason, like I'm like more into it this time than the other times.
2089280	2093760	I don't know if it's that they've balanced things or it just seems like there's more to do with the
2093760	2097440	seasonal content, what have you. But like, yeah, I'm kind of feeling the Minecraft Dungeons right
2097440	2103280	now. So I haven't done anything that far beyond the first few stages. But check in with me again
2103280	2107040	next week. It's been it's been a fun thing to play. I like some things. It's, it's kind of
2107040	2112320	scratching the Diablo itch before Diablo four comes out. And I did play this latest Diablo three
2112320	2117680	season. But I don't know if I'm really motivated to like go as far as I have in previous Diablo
2117680	2121280	three seasons. Like I'm kind of like, I don't know, we'll see. I've just had a lot of other
2121280	2126800	stuff I've been wanting to play, including theater them still playing Final Fantasy theater them.
2126800	2134320	I've played over 300 unique songs at this point. I have not yet played every song at least once I
2134320	2140480	know that because that's a trophy but I'm working on that. I've gotten about between 15 and 20
2140480	2146560	characters to level 99. I wish I could say that's the max level but it's not because you get stars.
2146560	2150880	Basically every time you level to 99 after that, so you can get up to nine star 99.
2151840	2157600	So I still have some work to do in that regard. But that's been a lot of fun to play. I still
2157600	2162160	really love theater them. The world ends with you DLC comes out this week. So I'll be playing those
2162160	2166960	songs on Thursday stream. They come out Wednesday, but I can't stream Wednesday because I have a
2166960	2173040	IRL conflict, but I'll be playing that on Thursday. So there's that. What else have I been
2173040	2176400	playing? I've also still been playing Dead by Daylight. Some new DLC came out for that.
2176960	2182640	I got the adept on the new survivors. But otherwise, I worry a little bit about the
2182640	2188400	state of the game right now. I think with a lot of popular streamers, they're starting to look for
2188400	2193840	other things to play. I don't know if the game's getting stale. It needs a new license. I think the
2193840	2200960	actual game loop needs a real kick in the pants. But I'm going to spare you the details of that
2200960	2203920	talk because I know that's what dark soccer is playing right now. And she'll talk plenty more
2203920	2209440	about the game when she comes on later. Let's see other games I've been playing Final Fantasy 14
2209440	2215520	also got a minor patch this week. So I checked out Final Fantasy 14. Their new content in that
2215520	2221680	is called Eureka Orthos, which is another type of deep dungeon. And what that is, that is a lol
2221680	2226640	procedurally generated dungeon. I don't know if I'd go so far to call it AI. I think it's just
2226640	2231680	very, very, I mean, I guess the end of the day, it's all AI. But it's very, very simple
2231680	2237040	programming that generates these very rudimentary dungeons, mazes, if you will, puts them together.
2237040	2244480	So you have basically like a random dungeon that you run every time. So it's kind of some
2244480	2249760	side content. It's a different way that you can level characters. This particular set allows you
2249760	2254880	to go from 81 to 90. And then there's other like cosmetic rewards. And there's, you know,
2255520	2259680	prestige, if you can clear the whole thing by yourself, because it's very difficult to solo,
2259680	2267680	it's notoriously difficult solo content. I believe Awesome Games Done Quick had
2268400	2273920	Palace of the Dead 180 to 190. They did that 10 floor segment of Palace of the Dead. That's what
2273920	2279760	this is. But it's like it's the Endwalker version of that because Palace of the Dead only ran up to
2279760	2286960	level 50. And then they had another one that went from, I think the Stormblood one, Heaven on High
2286960	2294800	went from 51 to 70. And they kind of skipped 70 to 80. They did completely different content as an
2294800	2301280	alternate 70 to 80 content. That was the Oh, God, what did they call that? It was an outside area
2301280	2305120	was it wasn't even a procedurally generated dungeon was like a whole other area that you
2305120	2310320	can level in. And now they're going back to this dungeon format for that. So Bojjan, that was the
2310320	2318080	name of it. Um, so yeah, I've been playing the Final Fantasy. And then what else? There's one
2318080	2322720	other one that was coming to mind and I'm not remembering in the moment. I guess it wasn't that
2322720	2326720	important. But I've still you know, been enjoying my PlayStation five, which is funny because I'm
2326720	2332000	not playing a lot of PS5 specific games on it. But I like the interface and I'm I'm ready for
2332000	2337120	Final Fantasy 16 whenever that comes out and whatever other PS5 treats might be waiting until
2337120	2341280	then. I haven't really touched Returnal a lot since the first week I got it. That's too bad.
2341920	2348960	There's only only so much time to play games though. So all right, let's move on and get
2348960	2353600	into some of the gaming news that has happened this week throughout the industry. Oh, real quick
2353600	2358800	some plugs. Before I get to that, here at the voice of geeks network at twitch.tv slash vog
2358800	2363840	network, we had a bonus stream this week on Thursday night, where Captain Matt formerly
2363840	2368640	of the starboard power coupling, and formerly formerly a long time ago, he went by Grandpa
2368640	2373040	Warcraft on Horde house, we actually teamed up for a stream on Thursday night where we talked
2373040	2379040	all about Star Trek at the cruise. So that is available in our archives for subscribers to the
2379040	2385440	vog network stream over on Twitch. So we're going to try to bring back some more bonus streams over
2385520	2389840	the coming months to give more value to those you that go the extra mile with your subscription
2389840	2396320	here. We always like to say thank you. Our podcast will always be free and watching live always free.
2396320	2403760	It's really only the bonus video that we are asking for your Amazon prime free sub or if
2403760	2409920	you're feeling so kind of $5 a month on Amazon to access the subs and there are an awful lot of you
2409920	2415680	that do subscribe. So thank you. Thank you very much for that. That allows us to fund the business,
2415680	2422400	which I saw that we made a payment to the legal stuff this week and keeping that all running and
2423040	2428400	yep, your money goes right to that. So we appreciate it because that's less money out
2428400	2433440	of our pockets really. All right. Let's get into some more gaming news and what's going
2433440	2436080	on throughout the industry. So we'll go over to you, Loki.
2436560	2441680	We will see like a music for this or music and like transition for this segment. It's
2442560	2449120	talking about the Activision acquisition by Microsoft and the ongoing saga that is.
2451120	2457360	Well, so a few more things. So we've got some more insight on how the negotiations are going.
2458000	2465840	So apparently coming from Lulu Chang, Missouri, from Activision, saying that Microsoft offered
2465840	2472400	Sony a 10-year agreement on the far better terms than Sony would ever get from us.
2473040	2478720	We also offered Sony a guaranteed long-term access to Call of Duty, but they kept refusing.
2478720	2488160	Why? And she said that in the CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment, in his words, said,
2488160	2491920	I don't want a new Call of Duty deal. I just want to block your merger.
2493200	2495440	So that statement's going to come back to bite.
2496640	2498480	That's that's drama.
2499280	2503520	Well, Microsoft can now like basically prove that they've tried to do things in good faith
2503840	2511440	and Sony's shut them down. I think there's definitely a drunk with power thing going on
2511440	2517040	with Sony. But the more I really step back and think about it, the more I really do realize
2517040	2524480	Call of Duty really has been something that's put Sony forward in a lot of the E3s of yesteryear
2524480	2531680	and so forth. Sony has been enjoying being number one in the race for some time. Well,
2531760	2536880	I don't know if they're always number one against Nintendo and maybe in the Xbox 360 era,
2536880	2540640	Microsoft was ahead for a little bit, but Sony inevitably caught up with PS3
2540640	2545040	and certainly worldwide they did. So I can see where this threatens them a little bit, but
2546880	2548880	Sony kind of needs the competition.
2548880	2554240	Well, they're also like kind of, I don't know what, here's some of the ridiculous
2554240	2558720	stuff that they're spouting to try to block this merger. So a new document submitted to
2558720	2565680	the UK's Competition and Markets Authority, Sony laid out hypothetical ways in which Microsoft
2565680	2572560	could circumvent the proposed 10 year deal in its offering to PlayStation. They said Microsoft might
2572560	2577600	release a PlayStation version of Call of Duty, where bugs and errors emerge only on the game's
2577600	2584400	final level or later updates. Even if such degradations can be swiftly detected, any remedy
2584400	2589200	would likely come too late, by which the time of the gaming community would have lost confidence
2589200	2595840	in PlayStation as the go to venue to play Call of Duty. Indeed, as modern warfare to attest,
2595840	2601200	Call of Duty is the most often purchased in just a few weeks of release. It has become known that
2601200	2605920	the game's performance on PlayStation was worse than Xbox. Call of Duty gamers could decide to
2605920	2611360	switch to Xbox for fear of playing their favorite game on a second class or less competitive venue.
2611360	2618880	That is so hypothetically ridiculous that it's just, it's just stupid. That's just a stupid
2618880	2623920	thing to say. And I don't know why they said it. I mean, they have to try to come up with a reason,
2623920	2628880	but that's just stupid. Like, yes, they're going to purposely put out a game with bugs
2630480	2636960	on purpose because they don't want to sell copies of the game. Like that doesn't make
2636960	2643840	any sense that they would do that. I just. I mean, Microsoft did just buy a company not
2643840	2648000	that long ago that's really good about putting out retail releases with bugs still in them.
2648000	2656160	So that's true that that game did run poorly on the PlayStation three. But I mean, it's just,
2656160	2664800	that's just stupid and silly to me. Like, I'm sorry. First off, like, you're assuming that
2664800	2669920	gamers are going to be smart. Like they're going to just go, Oh, well, it's the PlayStation. That's
2669920	2676000	why this isn't working. Not like, Oh, it's Activision putting out like shitty buggy games.
2676000	2681600	Like, I just think it's whatever. You know what? It's a strategy that they're trying. But like,
2681600	2686320	I think with this kind of nonsense that they're spouting on top of like the other stuff,
2687280	2691920	I don't know if they're going to side with Sony. I do just want to point out, I've been playing
2692000	2700000	Minecraft dungeons this week on my PlayStation. And it is very interesting seeing the Xbox Game
2700000	2704480	Studios logo pop up when you start the game because you know, that's the thing, right?
2704480	2708800	So you actually see the Xbox logo and I'm sure that MLB Oh, no, that was the other way around,
2708800	2715040	right? MLB The show was the PlayStation logo on an Xbox. So Oh, yeah, does that does that like have
2715040	2720880	did they make a crappy version of the game on the on the Xbox one or the Xbox Series S or whatever?
2720880	2726400	Because to get people to come play it on the PlayStation? No, that's stupid. It's a stupid
2726400	2731120	assessment. Why would they Why would you go through the process of making games like Oh,
2731760	2736720	but hey, you know, we're gonna we're gonna make this version crappy. You know who did that,
2736720	2742000	though? You know who made a crappier version of the game because of a certain company?
2742640	2749920	Sony did actually because you had locked away Spider Man from the Marvel Avengers game that
2749920	2754640	it couldn't be on other platforms because you decided to get your assholes and you want to keep
2754640	2755680	Spider Man to yourself.
2755680	2761040	I was just about to say I don't see Microsoft releasing a buggy version. But I see them
2761040	2769040	releasing a version where Oh, but the new map and the new DLC comes to Microsoft first for six weeks
2769040	2774160	before it comes to other platforms. Oh, and that whole thing, which by the way, has been Sony's
2774160	2779920	playbook specifically with Call of Duty for a very long time. And I'm afraid of literally of
2779920	2786240	getting a taste of their own medicine. I guarantee if if this were to fit, like for some reason,
2786240	2792480	this merger is not allowed to go through. And they decide that they're not going to purchase
2792480	2797680	the company anymore. I guarantee that they're going to try to that Sony is going to try to
2797680	2802080	purchase them. I guarantee it and all of this shit that they're talking about that it's going
2802080	2808480	to happen. It'll be the things that they do. Yeah, like is just yeah, they know that this is
2808480	2815280	going to be a possibility because this is their playbook right here. I don't know. But now,
2815280	2820240	granted, this is we're only seeing part of it. A lot of the information has been redacted from
2820240	2826000	Sony in regards to the stuff that's been leaked out. So or not leaked out, released, I guess,
2826000	2832480	to the public from these court filings. And there are, you know, obviously, the CMA
2832480	2837440	and other regulatory bodies have more information about this than we do. So hopefully, there's
2837440	2841520	people intelligent enough to know that this is going to be ridiculous. I think that they're be
2841520	2845920	they're making good faith efforts. Yeah, like, I get it. Like, 10 years, they're not going to
2845920	2851840	guarantee that Call of Duty is always going to be on the PlayStation. I mean, of course not.
2851840	2855760	But 10 years, I mean, that's like two console cycles right there. Like, come on.
2857280	2862640	DJ Rama S in chat says, when Microsoft fully acquires ABK, I expect a shift in console sales
2862640	2868400	in favor of Microsoft. I don't, at least not right out the gate. I think you're going to need to
2868400	2872400	start to look at the next console generation before you're really going to see the fruits of
2872400	2878560	that whole thing. But at this point, I and again, especially since they're committing to these
2878560	2882320	deals, they're willing to commit to the Sony deal, which I think they're even if Sony is
2882320	2888400	holding out on, I think they're going to have to eventually kind of make sure that still happens.
2889600	2892960	I feel like it's not going to matter for this, but it might matter in the future.
2894240	2899120	It'll be interesting. It'll be interesting to see. By the way, I have breaking news.
2900960	2907280	I was just handed this COVID test by Alan and it's negative. So Alan is now COVID free. Yay.
2909360	2912560	Hey, it's important to me. Okay. Because we've been stuck here all week.
2914240	2920640	All right. Let's move on. Let's talk about a recent game remake that got a lot of folks
2920640	2927600	attention. Thank you for the yays in chat. I appreciate it. We got a Chrono Cross remake
2927600	2933760	that happened not that long ago, which wasn't super well received because it has some frame
2933760	2938000	rate problems and a game that was running on the fucking PlayStation one shouldn't be having frame
2938000	2944800	rate problems, but that's, you know, it's gaming. But what's interesting in making the rounds this
2944800	2949360	week is a new YouTube interview with the development team behind Chrono Cross, the
2949360	2956320	Radical Dreamers edition. This is to recognize the game's 20th anniversary. The game's anniversary
2956320	2960720	was in 2019 and that's why this game was released. And they were kind of just, you know,
2960720	2965520	reflecting on the release of the game. And producer Kochiro Sakamoto said back when the
2965520	2971120	project was launched, Chrono Cross was possibly going to become unplayable. There was a game
2971120	2976480	archive service on PlayStation three that allowed you to play PlayStation one games, but PlayStation
2976480	2980960	four was already on the market. We didn't know at the time of PlayStation four would also have a
2980960	2987680	game archive service. It looked like Chrono Cross could become unplayable. So a remaster project was
2987680	2994800	set up. That's the backstory. So it's interesting that the whole reason this release happened was
2994800	3000320	because they didn't trust Sony to do the backwards compatibility on PlayStation four.
3000320	3006080	Now, of course, now that we're on PlayStation five, we know that PlayStation one games do make
3006080	3009600	their way to the catalog. In fact, I think they've been adding trophy support and things like that to
3009600	3016080	those games. Uh, but you know, either way we have the Radical Dreamers edition for better or for
3016080	3021440	worse. Um, because again, it had some frame rate issues, but I think they, I want to say, I heard
3021520	3025840	they did a patch not that long ago to try to address some of the issues. So it's interesting.
3025840	3032240	They're still working on it. Kind of interesting. So, uh, yeah. Bobby Blackall points out they
3032240	3037600	patched it. That's what I thought I had heard recently. That's for sure. So, um, yeah. Uh,
3037600	3042160	Dark Titsui also says I've been meaning to get that one. Yeah. I think they're, uh, you know,
3043440	3046720	if they're, they're always willing to make another sale with that, that's for sure.
3046720	3054320	So, all right. Um, let's, before we move on to the next story, I think I'm able to welcome to
3054320	3059680	the show question mark. Cause I noticed that they just joined discord. I think, do we have a Dark
3059680	3065760	Sakura? Not yet. Not yet. Okay. Well, we'll wait a couple more stories and then bring you in. All
3065760	3070880	right. I just wanted to go ahead and pop in, but I need to give my voice a rest for a few. Yeah. No
3070880	3074880	worries. No worries. We'll come back. Just turn your camera on when you're ready. All right. Let's
3074880	3082880	move on to, uh, the next story. Loki. All right. So, uh, Fortnite chapter four
3082880	3089280	season two is now live and they've added some new changes to the maps. Of course. Uh, this one now
3089280	3097200	has a giant mega city, uh, which is kind of like a cyberpunk inspired locale. They've got lots of
3097200	3104000	rails that you can grind on now. Uh, two person motorcycle, the victory, victory crown rogue,
3104000	3110160	a, uh, four person car called the nitro drifter. They have this really cool sword. Now they can
3110160	3116960	kill people with a katana called a kinetic blade. Uh, some new assault rifles, shotgun. Um,
3117840	3122640	they have new battle pass skins as well. So, uh, the one I thought was pretty awesome is
3122640	3129360	Aaron Yeager from attack on Titan, including his omni-directional mobility gear, which is awesome.
3129360	3136800	Uh, that looks pretty fun and, um, yeah, lots of, um, interesting things. Still don't want
3136800	3142400	to play the game, but it looks cool for those who are playing it though. Just not my thing.
3142400	3147120	Yeah. Not so Alan's trying to get me to do it though. He wants to do like a co stream where
3147120	3154240	he teaches stuff is really appealing to me. Yeah. And it might be like, you know,
3155440	3161120	cause I remember, I remember there was a time when like Minecraft, I was like, I just don't
3161120	3167040	get that game. I will get the appeal for that. Oh, okay. Yeah. I don't think I'd be like that
3167040	3171600	with Fortnite, but there was a time when mass effect, when I was like, I don't get it. There's
3171600	3176640	it's it happens. It happens. I mean, it looks, it looks okay. I just, I don't know. I'm not
3176720	3182240	like, I've been so out of shooters nowadays. It feels like, you know, to come into something
3182240	3187200	like that, you know, without it being like launch date of a new IP or something like that. It just
3187200	3192640	feels like you'd be at a massive disadvantage, but I don't understand why Fortnite removes
3192640	3198000	things from the store. Like, and brings them back only like one day out of the year because
3198000	3206080	like I would play for a night. I get that science behind it, but let it go on record. Epic games.
3206080	3212160	If you're out there listening, Tim Sweeney, if you're out there listening, no, I will not be
3212160	3219920	playing Fortnite until I can purchase the Ariana Grande skin. Just know that you want to make this
3219920	3225520	sale. Let me, let me buy the Ariana Grande skin. That's all I ask. I'm not asking for a lot.
3228880	3234080	Anyway, let's talk about a company that was giving us a lot this week. Capcom
3234080	3240480	had a whole little spotlight presentation. So it's called the Capcom Spotlight 2023. And they
3240480	3245120	showed quite a few things this Thursday. They had a little presentation, their own kind of direct of
3245120	3251040	sorts. And they talked about Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection. This, of course,
3251040	3255920	is all of the Battle Network games. I think we had known about this before. We didn't know the date.
3256480	3261760	It's coming out on April 14th is the date for PC, Switch, and PlayStation 4.
3261840	3265200	Which is one of those Nintendo Directs that they showed that I remember.
3265200	3268880	Yeah, yeah, they had originally unveiled it in a Nintendo Direct. So but now we have the date
3268880	3273680	and everything. So they showed that. Oh, Mike Deff says we already had known the date. Oh,
3273680	3277600	I didn't know that. Well, now we know it's PC and PS4. I don't know. They showed it anyway.
3278480	3286880	We also had a, they were talking about some of the gameplay features. 499 patch cards. They were
3286880	3292240	only available as physical cards, and a Buster Max mode. Those are all going to be in the game.
3292240	3296880	So I guess that information is also new. They hadn't talked about that in the Direct and so
3296880	3306080	forth. If you're a Mega Man fan, the Mega Man NT Warrior series will be streaming free on March 21st
3306080	3312400	if you want to check that out. Street Fighter 6, they didn't really mention any new fighters or
3312400	3314960	anything like that. Because last time they unveiled fighters, they unveiled a lot if I
3314960	3321680	remember right. But actress Hikaru Takahashi will be one of the commentators for the special
3321680	3326560	commentary feature. So that sounds like a whole interesting feature of the game. So they did
3326560	3333360	announce that. Also, Capcom Town will be coming out for Capcom's 40th anniversary. It is a digital
3333360	3339200	theme park and museum of Capcom's histories. You have to make a Capcom ID in order to see this.
3339200	3342960	This is not like an actual game. I think it's just like a website or something like that.
3343520	3349680	So there is that. Mike Deff says that the full roster were already out for the game,
3349680	3354240	that the last three were in the state of play from Sony. Well, the full roster was spilled like a
3354240	3360320	year ago, wasn't it? So there is that too. So sorry if I haven't been keeping track of each
3360320	3366880	one, but thank you for the update. Exo Primal Dinosaur Shooting Game will be coming out with
3366880	3375040	an open beta on March 17th and a full release on July 14th. Also, it is a day one Xbox Game Pass
3375040	3381600	title. So if you're only kind of curious about it, then you can try that. But of course, as I notice
3381600	3388400	more Game Pass games are tending to do, there's a season pass with Exo Primals with tracks and
3388400	3393680	pre-order bonuses and so forth. So yeah, if that's something that sounds like you want to spend money
3393680	3400400	on it, cool. Ghost Trick Phantom Detective is getting a remaster for Modern Systems and it will
3400400	3406720	be released on June 30th. Again, it's updated visuals and some gallery features in it as well.
3406720	3413280	Some new arrangements from Yasumasa Kitagawa, the great Ace Attorney composer, and you can swap back
3413280	3419760	and forth with the original music as well. So that's pretty neat. Monster Hunter Rise Sunbreak
3419760	3426080	will be coming out April 28th for Xbox and PlayStation, so that's cool if you want to
3426080	3435520	check that out. Resident Evil Death Island got a new trailer released. This is a CGI
3435520	3442800	animation and Jill Valentine is featured in that. And then lastly, a Resident Evil 4 demo was
3442800	3448560	released that day. That was the big news. The Resident Evil 4 demo came out now. It's called
3448560	3456160	the Chainsaw demo and you can see how the gameplay is on PlayStation, Xbox Series, and PC, and a lot
3456160	3461520	of people were picking that right up and streaming that and playing that and experiencing all those
3461520	3468720	scares all over again. So that was all the stuff that came out with the Capcom spotlight this week.
3469360	3476640	Not Capcom, but like sorely tangentially related. They also released a gameplay, like in-depth
3476720	3482880	gameplay thing for Dead Island 2, and it looks good. It looks really good. You can see where I
3482880	3490000	have concerns, but okay. Hey, if it's good, I'm excited. It looks good. Like, it really does look good.
3491440	3497360	We'll see. All right. All right, let's move on to our next story.
3500400	3505280	Actually, before I do that, I see Dark Soccer's got her camera on, so let me officially welcome
3505280	3511680	to the show Dark Sakura and her cat that you can see live here on Twitch, Ms. Middles. Hi!
3513280	3517440	And you're muted on Discord. Is this your first time? No, I'm just kidding.
3517440	3522880	I know you've had a long day. Hi, how are you? I'm all right. How are you? Good. How are the games
3522880	3528880	that you were playing just a minute ago? The games were pretty good. We had some nice
3528880	3533200	killers and we had some stinky killers, but I had fun playing with everybody and it was a fun
3533280	3541680	challenge to go into a match with no perks. Interesting. So, I was going to ask if you wanted
3541680	3545840	to catch us up a little bit on how was your gaming week? I mean, I guess we're talking a little bit
3545840	3548800	about your Dead by Daylight stuff, but I don't know if there's other things you want to share too?
3549360	3556240	I got my new controller, my SteelSeries Nimbus Plus, but for some reason, my SNES
3556240	3562080	simulator doesn't like it. So, I wasn't able to play Star Ocean, so I've been playing
3562080	3566080	Marvel's Midnight Suns on stream instead. Well, that's okay. Fair trade.
3566080	3571520	And my words hate some little cults of the land and some Beatles pinball because I actually really
3571520	3580080	love it even though it hates me. And of course, Dead by Daylight. I'm eerie one and we have a
3580080	3585520	rank reset tomorrow, but I need to start putting love back into my killers. So, I might do that
3585520	3590400	tonight. We'll see. What do you think of that? Because the new killer and survivors officially
3590400	3596000	came out. So, how are you feeling about Kris Jenner? That's the joke. If you don't follow
3596000	3602000	the Dead by Daylight memes, the new killer looks like Kris Jenner wearing a mask from Keeping Up
3602000	3607360	with the Kardashians. Kris Jenner with a mask and a big claw that she uses. And she's kind of a
3607360	3615520	sugar mommy too. So, the Kris Jenner lore is really funny to me. I mean, the thing about it
3615520	3624240	is that I don't like her animation because apparently when they animated her skeleton,
3624240	3630080	they didn't pay attention to how people actually walk. And then when she gets, you know,
3630080	3635920	teared up for bloodlust and gets the speed on, it looks really bizarre with the way that her
3635920	3641120	hips are animated. People do not walk like that. She struts her stuff as she walks.
3641760	3647280	Well, we were talking about it when I was playing with Tony Low and Rokums and Potato King.
3648400	3652240	And they're like, oh, she's supposed to be like the sexy serpent type. And I'm like,
3653600	3657280	and they're like, oh, hips don't lie. I'm like, no, her lips are full of lies. They are full
3657280	3661680	of falsehoods because they don't move that way. It just, it all lends itself to the rumor that
3661680	3665200	that whole pack was originally supposed to be the predator. Like, it's just, it's like,
3665200	3670320	it's animated like the predator. And some people are actually saying that, no,
3670320	3675280	that wasn't a predator license that got lost that I don't think they pursued it.
3677440	3687920	But no, she, we had one match with her and people are not using her, I think to her potential. So
3688880	3692960	of course I'm going to have to learn how to play her when I have to go for my adepts,
3692960	3698720	but I now have all of my survivor adepts. We did like a palette cleanser game, a palette,
3698720	3704960	palette cleanser game after we were done. And I decided to try to adapt Renato, although he's like
3706320	3709280	really loud, like really loud, like Leon levels of loud.
3710000	3715600	And I got the adept because a very nice trapper took me to the hatch.
3716640	3717280	Oh, nice.
3718080	3720480	So I now have all of my survivor adepts.
3720480	3726000	I got the survivor adepts of the two new ones as well. But funny enough, my Renato was also,
3726000	3730240	it wasn't a hatch, but it was a killer who gave up partway through the game and did the whole,
3730240	3733920	nope, I'm looking away. I'm just going to watch you walk out the door and that whole thing.
3733920	3736480	Like I got mine from a give up killer.
3737760	3742240	So that's what our first match was kind of like. And I'm actually our first match was a farmer
3742240	3744880	who actually came in and said, this is what I need. Will you help me?
3747360	3749520	At least they're honest. At least they're honest. Yeah.
3749520	3750020	All right.
3750640	3753200	So all right.
3753280	3754160	Sorry, she's making noise.
3754160	3757200	Well, good. I'm glad you're in the back corner of my camera.
3757200	3759200	I'm glad the stream was a success.
3759760	3762640	I hope you were able to plug OLR to a whole new audience.
3763200	3764320	I did actually.
3764320	3768640	When we introduced ourselves, I said that immediately afterwards would be podcasting.
3770000	3775520	And I was like, after the Palette Cleanser match, I have to go. I've got to do OLR.
3775520	3779600	But 21 years, we got to keep going at it.
3779600	3785440	Well, welcome and hello to anyone that might have come in from all that debauchery and fun and
3785440	3791760	merriment. So all right. We have we have a whole segment for Dark Soccer coming up in just a
3791760	3796400	moment. But before we get there, we have just a couple of other stories. So let's get into this
3796400	3800240	one, which ironically also has to do with classic games a little bit, right, Loki?
3800800	3808080	Yeah, a little bit. So this is a little bit of speculation. Just, you know, some, you know,
3808080	3814480	thoughts, I guess, thinking about the new potential switch hardware. And so there was
3814480	3821840	a video put out by Modern Vintage Gamer, who also is a creator and developer at Nightdive Studios,
3822480	3825840	talking about, you know, some of the hurdles that they would have to cross
3827280	3832400	working with new switch hardware that would be running on something other than the Tegra X1 chip,
3832720	3839280	basically saying that, you know, there's going to be some problems with backwards compatibility,
3839280	3844400	which, you know, a lot of folks are assuming that it's going to be backwards compatible
3844400	3852560	with switch games, this new console, whatever. But because the way the games work and how they
3852560	3859120	have all the pre compiled shaders and everything included with the games, that it may not be able,
3859120	3864080	you may not be able to port that stuff over because those chips sets won't be compatible
3864080	3869360	with each other. And it'll essentially require the game to be recompiled for that new chipset.
3870720	3876800	And that, you know, unfortunately, that the hardware is probably not going to be powerful
3876800	3882400	enough to run emulation for it. They're comparing to like, say, the Steam Deck, you know, which
3882400	3888880	struggles to run switch games emulated. But I mean, if it's more powerful than that,
3888880	3895840	maybe it could do it, but I don't see Nintendo doing that. But yeah, it's it's interesting to
3895840	3900400	see, you know, what they're going to do with that. I wouldn't be surprised if it's not compatible
3900400	3905920	with switch games. Nintendo hasn't shied away from backwards compatibility, especially in these,
3905920	3910560	like, you know, we were talking like the Wii U, I mean, I guess the Wii U, the Wii,
3911440	3917120	that was Yeah, yeah. And the Wii would play GameCube. So I mean, yeah, I mean, so they tried,
3917120	3923840	but I don't know if it's can be done here. Like, maybe be a lot of those systems. So like,
3923840	3928160	especially when we're talking the Wii U and the Wii, I don't think the Wii U is playing.
3928800	3936160	I think that also may have had this chip sets from the Wii inside of the Wii U as well. I know that
3936160	3939920	like the Wii had GameCube hardware. I was gonna say, wasn't the running gag about the Wii is
3939920	3946800	that it was two GameCubes duct taped together? Yes, that's very true. Um, so I don't know,
3946800	3950880	I think this is gonna be a problem that we'll just have to wait and see what happens with this.
3950880	3957120	But you mean, just don't count on anything and you won't be disappointed, I guess. I guess but,
3957120	3963120	you know, also, it would be very disappointing if it wasn't somehow backwards compatible,
3963120	3966880	especially considering how much of a digital library a lot of people are building themselves
3966880	3971600	at this point, right? Like, you know, even if it has to do with the new system can't handle
3971600	3976480	the cartridge or whatever silly thing it is, like, at least let the digital end of it be
3976480	3981040	backwards compatible, my god. And then I also wonder, like, if they do go to a new system,
3981040	3986960	what are they going to do in the place of the Nintendo online? And are they going to go back to
3988080	3992880	diving for games? Because that seemed to be more popular. So I can see them still moving the
3992880	3997440	Nintendo online stuff over because a lot of that stuff is just emulating old consoles, which
3997440	4004000	that any hardware should be able to handle. It's just I think the actual games themselves,
4004000	4009520	the Switch games are going to be a little bit trickier, but we'll see what they end up putting
4009520	4014480	in there. It also, you know, one of the things I see them like talking about like the Tegra X1
4014480	4020480	chips and stuff. I mean, who's to say they couldn't like put an X1 chip in there and then
4020480	4025760	something else on top of that? Like, I don't know what cost wise that would do for the console,
4025760	4030160	but like, it's not possible for them to have two different chips.
4030160	4034000	Fucking cloud streaming. That's what everyone, even on Nintendo's own system,
4034000	4037760	a lot of developers are turning to that, you know, with control and,
4037760	4039520	you know, some of the other games doing that.
4039520	4041280	So they can't run anything.
4041280	4047120	Yeah, be very interesting. So let's see, as Joe and Hunter Matt points out,
4047120	4052400	Microsoft's made it work well. Yeah, you know, and Microsoft was one of those companies where,
4052400	4056240	you know, remember when they shied away from backwards compatibility and they got raked
4056240	4060080	through the coals for it? Well, they really caught up and they've done a really good job,
4060080	4064000	you know, catching up. Not every single game is backwards compatible, but you know, because
4064000	4069520	obviously I still miss the old DDR games, but there is that. Yeah. Mike Deaf says,
4069520	4073440	yeah, it's surprising that Microsoft is leading the way for retro compatibility.
4073440	4077120	Not when you look at who's the head of the company, to be honest. I think, you know,
4077120	4083040	he's been a gamer more than some of the executives at other companies. And it's just kind of goes to
4083040	4092400	show that. So let's see. Yeah. Looking for some other comments over twitch.tv slash fog network,
4092400	4099840	again, where we do tape live every Sunday night. I find it interesting that this almost like this,
4099840	4104720	this whole talk about the backwards compatibility, it almost cements the fact that there's not going
4104720	4108800	to be a switch pro anymore. Like I think a lot of us were just assuming there was going to be a
4108800	4115360	super switch, or the next switch or the next console would be a switch, but more. But now it's
4115360	4119600	going to be very interesting to see what does happen next, because I sort of thought the switch
4119600	4125280	model was really working for Nintendo. Do you see Nintendo shying away from the whole, you're
4125280	4128960	playing it handheld, you're playing it on the TV, you're playing a handheld, you're playing it on
4128960	4135440	TV? Well, I don't see how Nintendo gets away from that at this point. No, I don't think that they
4135440	4139920	would do that. I mean, considering they even have some models that don't connect to the TV at all.
4139920	4144880	So they're definitely embracing like the portableness of it. Certainly, I think they
4144880	4151440	could do more to like try to increase the hardware specs in it. I mean, the very least get something
4151440	4158720	that's kind of comparable to say, the Steam Deck, you know, something like that. But yeah, it would
4158720	4165120	be kind of hard for them to move away from it. But at the same time, like, would I be that
4165120	4172640	disappointed? Maybe I guess my kids like playing it. They may mostly play it handheld anyways, but
4174880	4179760	I don't know. Personally, me, I wouldn't care. I wouldn't care if they did something completely
4179760	4187440	different, but I get it. Yeah. All right. Well, in this next story, we are talking about a very
4187440	4193680	unlikely partnership of sorts. And that has to do with Diablo 4, which you know, is still on deck
4193680	4201840	to come out this June. And KFC. Yeah, Blizzard is teaming up with KFC to help you get into the
4201840	4207200	upcoming beta for Diablo 4 on PC and console. Now I want to point out there's multiple ways to get
4207200	4213520	into this beta, you could just buy the Uber edition for like $100, which I may have done
4214480	4219520	and get your way into the beta that way. But if that doesn't sound appetizing to you, well,
4220240	4225360	you can go get a Double Down sandwich. And I use that term sandwich loosely when it comes to this.
4225360	4232160	You can go get a Double Down on the toilet, a food product from KFC or the delivery app.
4232160	4238240	I think it's interesting. You have to get it from KFC.com or the delivery app. However,
4238240	4242000	you don't have to actually eat it if you don't want to. You just have to pay the money for one.
4242320	4246960	Buying the sandwich will give you a code and you put that in your Battle.net account and you will
4246960	4253680	be able to get into the beta, which is next weekend, March 17th through March 20th. Apparently,
4253680	4259440	this is only available in the US, not available in Canada, because I don't think the Double Down
4259440	4265440	is available in Canada yet. So or I'm sure it has something to do with regions and like, yeah.
4265440	4268240	Yeah.
4269840	4275760	No, the Double Down on paper sounded like a good thing. Like I tried it back when they first had
4275760	4280480	it and it was a disappointment. It's not very good. Like the sauce that they put on it, not
4280480	4287920	very good. I like KFC, but like, nah, it's just it's it's all gimmick. It really is.
4288640	4294080	Quest Buster says Diablo 4 with 11 herbs and spices. It's, you know, the partnership with
4294080	4298560	Diablo 4 is because when you eat a Double Down sandwich, you are going to experience hell,
4299360	4302080	flying out of your butthole and lighting sweet.
4302080	4309040	Honestly, they should have partnered with Dave's Hot Chicken, which I think has a Diablo
4310000	4315680	heat level. They may be called Inferno, but like, you should order one of those where it literally
4315680	4321760	will burn your ass off like if you eat it. That would have been like, really, that would have
4321760	4326320	made more sense than KFC. KFC and the Double Down. That's stupid.
4327040	4333200	Oh, God. All right. Well, for those of you that are going to participate in getting a Double Down
4333200	4338960	to get yourself a Beta Key, I salute you. And maybe maybe this will lead to a whole new toilet
4338960	4345600	paper shortage across America. We'll see. All right. Let's let's go back to a simpler time.
4345600	4353440	When at KFC, you got chicken while you enjoyed a classic video game. Let's get to the segment.
4363920	4369440	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull
4369440	4374320	out a classic and tell you about it. It's time for the classic game of the week.
4376000	4378800	And what did you pick for us this week, Dar Sakura?
4379520	4388080	I picked Balls with a Z. So not to be confused with a more current mobile game. So it is a 2.5D
4388640	4395040	action fighting game that came out for the Sega Genesis slash Mega Drive and the Super NES and
4395040	4402240	the 3DO. It was developed by a company called PF Magic, published by Accolade, and it came out
4402320	4409680	in 1994. The 3DO version is a director's cut that came out in 1995. It has three difficulty levels
4409680	4419440	and you can play 21 matches. And it's unique because the characters are just literally made
4419440	4428000	out of balls. Balls. She said balls. And the game really wasn't super successful,
4428000	4434880	but PF Magic used that technology to make some virtual pet titles like Pets, Dogs, Cats, and
4434880	4448560	Oddballs, all with a Z. It basically was proposed by someone named Keith Kirby to use the balls
4449280	4454320	as the characters. And so they implemented the idea to save processing power. And then the fact
4454320	4460320	that no matter where the in-game camera, where the camera would be as they positioned it for
4460320	4468400	the characters, that they would look the same from all angles because balls. The Mega Drive
4468400	4474080	one was supposed to use the Edge 16, which is a modem system for multiplayer, but that was
4474080	4482800	canceled. And of course, it's opening statement for the game on the Mega Drive was to be the
4482880	4488320	champion, you gotta have balls. I know, mature. But because of the double entendre,
4488320	4493440	Nintendo was like, no, you can't use that. So it was changed to you gotta play balls.
4495520	4501680	So as far as your characters went, you had a few interesting ones.
4503920	4508960	The main characters were Boomer, which was a clown, Bruiser, which was a bodybuilder,
4508960	4516000	Crusher, that was a rhinoceros, Divine, a ballerina dancer and not, you know, the drag queen,
4517360	4521680	Kronk, who's a caveman, Tsunami, who is a sumo,
4524240	4531280	Turbo, who is a superhero, that's the only one with ranged attacks, Yoko the monkey. And only
4531280	4536240	in the 3DO version, which was the director's cut, you get a character named Zombie. As for the
4536240	4545120	bosses, you have Guggler, which is an ostrich, Bounder, that is a kangaroo, T-Rex, W-R-E-C-K-S,
4545120	4555120	that's a dinosaur, Lamprey, which is a genie, and the Jester, which is the one that issued
4555120	4560480	the challenge and he is the ultimate boss. The game got really mediocre reviews.
4561440	4567840	EGM said the fighters are interesting, their taunts were funny, the whole idea is very
4567840	4574640	innovative, but at the end, it was just really bland. I mean, people thought that it was,
4574640	4578800	you know, it was a good concept. People liked it, but most of the people are just like,
4580160	4587120	it's just the whole thing together didn't come together very well. But it was praised for its
4587120	4593680	graphics, its design, and some of its sound design, but the moves were way too limited to
4593680	4600400	keep it interesting. It was ranked seventh on the 2011 list of top 10 fighting games we'd like to
4600400	4611280	forget by Game Informer. Next Generation reviewed the 3DO version of the game and gave it a two out
4611280	4615920	of five stars and said, and I'm going to read the quote, if you accept its looks, it plays fine,
4615920	4620240	but this is as much yesterday's technology as any sprite based fighter attempting to get away
4620240	4626800	with digitized characters. It's almost too bad, but it's just a game out of time. And that's the
4626800	4635200	game. Balls. Alright, not a game that, you know, we don't always spotlight games that were incredible,
4635200	4643040	but this was certainly unique. I mean, this was very much a product of its time. Oh, was it?
4643680	4647440	I think someone mentioned it. So I was like, yeah, I'll do it. Yeah. No, it's a good pick,
4647440	4652720	but it's definitely a product of its era. I do also have some late breaking news or more
4652720	4656720	recently news. Oh, what's that? Like as another story, if you don't mind. Sure, go for it.
4657760	4662080	Warning to people playing Dead by Daylight right now, there's a series of DDoS attacks where they
4662080	4669280	follow your IP. And in some cases, they're able to cut through VPNs. So I would highly suggest
4669280	4673680	if you're going to play DVD right now, play through a VPN, make sure it's a really strong one.
4675440	4682320	I'm not too worried myself because I play through Geforce, which is a virtual environment.
4683040	4686320	But at the same time, I just wanted to go and put that out there. And of course,
4686320	4690720	we don't have any word from behavior yet. No, of course not. It's Sunday. They're not
4690720	4695440	even in the office. So yeah, it's just worth mentioning. Yeah. Alright.
4695440	4701520	Uh, let's rapidly tackle some other news going on in the industry with some rapid fire news.
4701520	4708800	We'll start with Loki. Yeah. So more Nintendo Lego sets coming. And now we're going to get
4708800	4716640	Lego Donkey Kong coming out this summer, uh, as part of the Lego Mario series of sets.
4716640	4723280	Along with that, they also unveiled, uh, a brand new Dry Bowser castle that's coming out August
4723280	4730960	1st for $110. Uh, this was, uh, Lego's Mario day announcements that they had. Um,
4732160	4739760	it's all too expensive. And apparently Mario is riding, um, Donkey Kong like a Yoshi or something.
4739760	4746880	That's kind of weird. Um, also for Mario day, of course, we got a brand new, uh, Mario movie direct
4746880	4754160	with the final trailer. It looks cool. Lots of Mario cartness and we even get fire Donkey Kong.
4755840	4759600	So go check it out. I can't wait to see the movie. It's like less than a month away now.
4760240	4765200	Yeah. For all my issues with one particular casting, I just feel like everything we've
4765200	4770880	seen about it seems to rise above it. So I'll probably check it out. Um, if someone will take
4770880	4777760	me on a date, but maybe Alan will actually see it. Who knows? We, we very rarely get out to
4777760	4781120	movies. It's funny. Cause I was commenting to somebody the other day. I was like, yeah,
4781120	4785520	I think I've only seen two movies in the theater in the last year. And one of them was everything
4785520	4789840	everywhere all at once, you know, for all the talk about the movie going on tonight. I'm like,
4789840	4794720	I think that's like one of two movies I saw in the theater in the last year or so. Um,
4794720	4800160	maybe super Mario brothers will be one for this year. We'll see. Let's see. All right.
4800960	4805040	I hear that the judges and dragons movie is awesome too. Like the reviews have been great
4805040	4811840	so far, which is funny because the nineties one was not so no, that was a terrible movie.
4812880	4817440	It'd be nice if they flipped the script a little. I really liked actually the one they did. And of
4817440	4822480	course, Kroll was originally supposed to be a D and D movie. Interesting. All right. Uh,
4822480	4829600	Darcy, you had a quick story for us here. Yeah, I guess I do. Um, so surprising to really
4829600	4836960	nobody that's watched the show. Last of Us is the highest ranked video game adaptation of all time.
4836960	4842000	It's been getting great reviews. It's been renewed for a second season. It had the second high,
4842000	4848880	second largest debut, uh, according to HBO. Um, it's behind actually the house of the dragon
4849440	4859040	and it's been just considered amazing. It got, uh, a 9.4, uh, out of 10 across the boards for,
4859040	4868160	uh, uh, IMDB and a lot of the ranking systems. Um, it actually almost matches the games ranking,
4868160	4877920	which was a 9.7. Um, and the user, uh, rankings on IMDB are like just astounding over the,
4877920	4881840	over the moon. It's, it's better than the Witcher in part, in terms of how it was ranked as well.
4882400	4888400	And it's even ranking over Castlevania and definitely over Halo, which was terrible,
4888400	4897280	but yeah, as far as the video game ones, just to go through, um, uh, the, uh, adaptation.
4897280	4902800	So last of us is at the top followed by the Witcher and the league of legends was as arcane
4902800	4910000	Castlevania, Halo, Tron uprising. I don't know why that's there because it was not the video
4910000	4917760	game. The dragon age absolution was also pretty, pretty up there, but above all of it, um,
4918640	4923120	and number nine on the list, by the way, is Mass Effect Paragon lost, which was pretty good.
4924240	4927840	Our arcane that league of legends one is apparently really good, even if you don't
4927840	4931280	really follow legal legends. So I thought that was interesting. So I'm not surprised
4931280	4937600	that's popping up there. So, um, but, uh, I just, uh, at some point I'll get around to watching the
4937600	4941840	last of us. I'm just so behind on TV. You know what? I finally watched this week, especially
4941840	4947440	considering the cruise I just went on. I finally started watching lower decks this week. It's
4947440	4952880	really funny. I like, I'm actually glad I finally got motivated to watch it cause it is really funny.
4952880	4959040	So, and the, the characters in it are so good. So, you know, I only have what, like 28 more
4959040	4962400	episodes of that to watch and then I can get around to a last of us to some of this other
4962400	4967360	stuff I'm behind on. So I'm just that cool hip old man watching shows from five years ago.
4968800	4975120	All right. Uh, speaking of up and coming new things, you can check out the Xbox games showcase
4975120	4980560	on June 11th. That's going to be immediately followed by a star field direct. So it's going
4980560	4986720	to be a big day for lots of Xbox games. Of course, that date probably sounding very much like an E3
4986720	4994000	kind of date. And considering we still don't, by the way, less than three months out until E3 and
4994000	5001200	we don't even have confirmation that it's actually happening. Um, I'll just leave that there, but
5001200	5006000	Microsoft will be doing a game showcase if you know, nothing else on June 11th. And I imagine
5006000	5010160	not only will we hear about star field, but maybe some of the other releases from Microsoft this
5010160	5018480	year, I'm hoping for fable. I'm hoping for some news on fable. I really want to know what playground
5018480	5024000	for fable. Yeah. The, uh, uh, Forza horizon team is done with the fable series because Forza
5024000	5029520	horizon is, you know, they, they, there are many people, myself among them that will say, that's
5029520	5034160	the reason to own an Xbox. That is the game you are truly missing. If you are not on Microsoft's
5034160	5040240	platform is horizon. Even if you're not a racing game fan, it horizon is that good. And, uh, the
5040240	5046080	fact that they're going to be working on now fable makes me really curious what they're going to do
5046080	5051520	with it. Uh, Zen monkey 11 and chat says, it's just going to be a fable MMO light game. I don't,
5051520	5056880	I don't maybe, I am sorry. Don't threaten me with a good time. I know that actually would not be a
5056880	5062240	bad thing. I mean, could it be open world the way the horizon is open world that it's a little bit
5062240	5066640	more drop in and drop out? Like I don't want to just assume because horizon has done a certain
5066640	5070400	way fable is going to be done the same way. I think the developers have the bandwidth to do
5070400	5077040	other stuff with it if they want. So, uh, anyway, I'll be very curious to see what comes out of
5077040	5083280	this, but we'll, we'll all find out together on June 11th. Is that a show night? Cause I know,
5083280	5088800	uh, I'm having a peek ahead June. Yes. June 11th is a show night. Ooh, this could be interesting.
5088800	5093200	This could be an interesting summer. All right, we'll see. Uh, let's travel around the world and
5093200	5097600	check out some releases, some things that are going to be coming out a little sooner than fable
5097600	5104240	on the Xbox, uh, things this week in the U S and beyond starting in the U S Loki. Uh, we have hot
5104240	5110480	wheels, rift rally on iOS PlayStation form PlayStation five, uh, the legend of heroes trails
5110480	5118080	to Azure on PC, Nintendo switch and PlayStation four, uh, Valheim coming to Xbox one and Xbox
5118080	5124560	series. Vernal edge on PC, Nintendo switch, PlayStation four, PlayStation five, Xbox one
5124560	5132880	and Xbox series. Alice gear, agus CS, uh, concentro of the symbol tricks, I guess,
5133440	5138960	civil tricks, uh, that's on the Nintendo switch PlayStation four and PlayStation five,
5138960	5144800	the dark pictures, switchback VR. I thought that was a large game, but as this kind of launch,
5144800	5152800	uh, that is on PlayStation VR to, uh, post void, the Nintendo switch and PlayStation four,
5153600	5161040	Bayonetta origins, Theresa and the lost demon on Nintendo switch flame keeper on PC and
5161040	5169840	Nintendo switch. And, uh, last but not least WWE two K 23 on PC, PlayStation four, PlayStation
5169840	5176160	five, Xbox one and Xbox series. Uh, before we get to Japan, great question from chat regarding the
5176160	5180960	Xbox event when dark to see a pointed out, uh, that he wasn't sure what time it was going to be
5180960	5185680	at. They haven't announced the time. And that is very interesting. I would bank that it's probably
5185680	5189840	going to be more of a morning ish event. I don't think necessarily like 9.00 AM, but it could be
5189840	5195680	more like an 11 AM, maybe even as early as 10 AM. Here's my logic behind that, um, Europe, or,
5195680	5200560	you know, not all of Europe, but you know, the, the, the main Europe time is going to be five
5200560	5206000	hours ahead of Eastern time, which is eight hours ahead of Pacific time. So something that's at
5206000	5210960	noon for us in California is going to be at 8 PM for Europe or prime time. If they are going to
5210960	5215280	feature a game like fable being developed by a studio in Europe, it makes a lot of sense for
5215280	5219520	them to do that with the world being the way it's laid out. Somebody is always going to have it in
5219520	5224720	the middle of the night. Um, Japan being in the middle of the night for Microsoft makes a lot of
5224720	5229840	sense. Microsoft is, it doesn't have as much to show Japan. We all know that. So, uh, it makes
5229840	5235120	sense that because if they did it in the morning here, it would be something like, God, probably
5235120	5240480	like three in the morning for Japan. But I think Microsoft's probably willing to, uh, cut that loss.
5241120	5245440	Whereas if they did it in the, at the, in the night here, if they did it at a 5 PM or an 8 PM
5245440	5250480	slot, it's going to be like one or 2 AM for Europe. And I think, uh, Microsoft's not going
5250480	5254960	to want to do that. So we'll see what happens though. Uh, anything could happen and, you know,
5254960	5260320	if maybe they have a big announcement that they want Japan's attention for, uh, anything is
5260320	5265120	possible. Speaking of Japan, let's check out the releases that they are getting this week.
5265120	5271840	We'll start with the Nintendo switch, which sees Dawn of the monsters this week, as well as Jitsu
5271840	5277760	squad in a regular and special edition. This week, six target star trail is out in a regular
5277760	5284320	and limited edition stranger of sword city, as well as blue winged. Chevalier comes out this
5284320	5290480	week. Uh, also Bayonetta origins, uh, in a lockstep with the European release of Bayonetta
5290480	5295680	origins and the U S release on St. Patrick's day. So Bayonetta is also out on the switch.
5295680	5300560	That game is releasing a lot sooner than I would have expected it to, but I guess it has been in
5300640	5304720	those directs lately. So it's just, I'm just like, Whoa, that game is suddenly coming. Okay. I
5304720	5309680	thought that was like a summer game. Anyway, PlayStation five, you really only have Dawn
5309680	5318400	of the monsters this week, but you also have an, a no, a no 1800. Uh, this is a, uh, Ubisoft game.
5318400	5324720	That's like old warships type of thing. So, uh, 1800 probably being the year. Uh, so that is out
5324800	5330480	this week as well. And, uh, that is it for PlayStation five releases this week.
5330480	5338400	Let's go over to Europe, dark soccer. We have on the 14th, uh, transport fever two for PlayStation
5338400	5347760	X-Box for the same also clash artifacts of chaos, Zeno edition, WWE two K 23 deluxe edition on the
5347760	5355280	16th for PlayStation switch. We have Alice gear Aegis, um, for PlayStation and X-Box we have, uh,
5355280	5363040	I know 1800 console edition, uh, for, uh, PC. We are, I should say just for computer, we have,
5363040	5368880	uh, the Sims four going together expansion on the 17th for PlayStation and switch. We have a signal
5368880	5376800	us, um, on switch, we have Bayonetta origins, Theresa and the lost demon on, uh, the three,
5376800	5383680	we have Peppa pig world adventures. Um, on the 17th for PlayStation X-Box, we have WWE
5383680	5389120	two K 23, um, for PlayStation switch, we have windstorm and unexpected arrival.
5391680	5396480	All right. A few more stories for y'all, and then we'll get to the listener round table
5396480	5400160	featuring your emails. Actually, I don't think we have emails tonight, but maybe we'll see
5400160	5405680	participate at orange.com, uh, phone calls and chat comments. Uh, we'll get to that in a minute
5405680	5412400	though, but first we have some more stories for you. Loki. Yeah. So, um, with the new update that
5412400	5418240	came out for Mario Kart eight, it of course added Berto to the roster of characters,
5418240	5425040	but along with that, a new column for, uh, new characters. And now it appears that there's still
5425040	5430560	five more new characters coming to Mario Kart eight. So that's exciting. Um, we'll have to
5430560	5436640	see who exactly is going to be coming, but, um, I guess in the future DLC, we'll see those five
5436640	5442800	characters come in. Orange. Right. And chat says pink, gold, Daisy. Don't joke about that because
5442800	5448560	honestly like just alternate skins of existing care. I bet I'm going to put, I'm going to put
5448560	5453440	an official OLR bet an official Rob Roberts prediction. At least one of those characters
5454000	5457840	is just some terrible reskin of an existing character.
5459520	5462960	But I bet we'll get a couple. I bet we'll get a couple interesting ones in that.
5462960	5467360	I'm not sure who's missing. Oh, fire emblem. We don't have anyone from fire emblem in the game
5467360	5473840	yet. Right. You will get someone from the Mario movie. We can get the, one of those penguins.
5474800	5479120	Oh, that might be cute. A Mario movie tie-in. I like what you're thinking with that. Yeah.
5479120	5485280	Maybe one of the penguins or something. Huh? That's a cute idea. Yeah. Mike Defton chat says
5485280	5491680	silver Yoshi and Birdo. Oh, yo Yoshi's a prime target for the really cheap reskin type of thing.
5491680	5496320	Cause Yoshi already had reskins. That's in the lore. If you want to go back to super Mario world
5496320	5501440	and like the red Yoshi that shoots fire. Well, you can do that already in Mario card eight. You can,
5501440	5506080	you select Yoshi and you can choose the ultimate thing for that. I haven't played in so long. I
5506080	5510880	don't even remember that. So, but yeah, there's stupid things like metal Mario where it's like
5510880	5516080	gold Mario and yeah. Yeah. So pink gold. All right. We'll see. We'll see. All right.
5518480	5528240	Moving on dark soccer. Amazon's got actually an abstract proposed for something called Alexa
5529040	5535680	arena, which excuse me, my voice is catching. Which basically is an interactive platform
5536640	5545200	for AI training where you go through the game and it's, you have to like do just certain
5545200	5551840	normal tasks, a specific way. Like one is plug the floppy disc into the computer with a skull on it,
5552480	5558080	you know, and it's like this, the scenario laid out is going into an office, but it's supposed to
5558160	5568480	work for machine learning to apply to everyday office use and personal assistant use. So yeah,
5568480	5574400	our robot overlords are getting closer. This kind of ties in a little bit so that
5574400	5577840	I know you were here at the beginning of the show. We were talking in depth a little bit about AI,
5578560	5581360	you know, and that seems to be the next big thing in gaming because, you know,
5581360	5587440	Discord's been doing a lot with AI and this, you know, training the robots, how to kind of,
5587440	5591760	it's interesting that a lot of companies are going this direction. It's going to be very
5592480	5599360	interesting to see. I've taken some courses in machine learning and it actually,
5600800	5604320	they can't really do anything without the information that we feed them. So they have
5604320	5610480	to build up a massive database of information. Doing a game to do this is actually a pretty
5610480	5616640	smart idea. You know, I'm just saying. There are clever ways to get people's data,
5616640	5622720	absolutely. No, I'm not saying this is for people's data. This is for training in AI by providing it
5622720	5625680	feedback. My brain went to- This has nothing to do with personal data.
5625680	5632960	My brain went to Pokemon sleep and how that is like using cute little, cute Pokemon to
5632960	5638400	farm people's sleeping data. Which is, this is something completely different. This is teaching
5638400	5642640	activity and giving it a broad range of activity to add to its learning.
5642640	5646640	All right. My brain's a little bit on this whole stealing things.
5646640	5648080	That's not how machine learning works.
5648720	5652640	Well, say that to the AI art robots because that's-
5652640	5657920	That's a little different. This is more for teaching an assistive AI.
5659200	5660880	All right. Moving on. Loki.
5661520	5669040	All right. So this is not too surprising, but you know, after the reveal of the Suicide Squad
5669040	5674160	gameplay that was recently part of the deep dive that they did in the PlayStation,
5675360	5681040	was it PlayStation Now event that they had, fans were very disappointed by what they saw.
5681760	5690240	And as such, Rocksteady has now delayed the game from May to sometime later this year to
5691840	5694400	address those concerns from-
5695040	5698880	Taking a page out of the first Sonic the Hedgehog trailer playbook, right?
5699680	5701360	Something to that effect. Yeah.
5701360	5704080	Hey, you know what? It worked out well for that movie. So
5704640	5708320	maybe- Honestly, this actually is probably news we should be applauding.
5708320	5709920	I don't think we should be looking at this going-
5710480	5717760	Yeah. Basically saying- Jason Schreier explained that, you know, don't expect any big changes,
5717760	5721680	but you know, instead it's gonna be some polishing as to what's already there.
5724480	5730000	They're gonna have to make some changes though, because it looked pretty not great.
5732480	5737280	You know what? It's just like, Suicide Squad's just not crack down. Please don't make it crack
5737280	5746480	down. All right. Well, this particular series isn't Persona, but that's not going to stop
5746480	5754240	somebody from trying. And yes, I've been sent this little movie a lot. And I think technically
5754240	5758400	it came up at the end of the show last week, but let's talk now officially on record about
5758960	5763280	the Persona type RPG where you are going to play as the Golden Girls.
5764640	5769440	That's right. It's the Golden Girls Take Manhattan DX, and it's developed by Joey
5769440	5775760	Pagano and Chris Lindgren. It's a fast paced JRPG where you play as Rose, Dorothy, Sophia,
5775760	5782080	and Blanche on the streets of Miami where you're battling clowns for whatever reason. And you do
5782080	5788320	Dark Souls type adventures through dungeons. There's a whole trailer as well that came out,
5788320	5794400	which I don't know how this isn't getting cease and desisted, but apparently what happened,
5794400	5802400	and this is all on the Game Dev website, if you want to read at j-e-o-y.dev, you can read the
5802400	5806560	blog that says, what started as a joke has quickly spiraled into a playground of ideas meant to
5806560	5811600	explore just how much we can push our skills and retain our sanity with our own brand of humor.
5811600	5816320	Simply put, this is Persona 5's gameplay replaced with the context of the Golden Girls. There is no
5816320	5821440	reason why we use that coat of paint other than how far can we take this joke? I'm a little
5821440	5828240	worried it's going to get C&D'd over that, but otherwise it's scheduled to release this holiday
5828240	5840480	season. In looking at the trailer, the characters look different enough. When you do something like
5840480	5849600	this, it doesn't just have to be like the Golden Girls IP, but then you also have the likenesses
5849600	5858240	to the actresses that played Blanche, Sophia, and so forth. And I would say that I don't think
5859600	5866480	that the rose really looks like Betty White, but the Dorothy looks a lot like Bea Arthur to me.
5867120	5873840	So I feel like that's a whole other place that this could get tied up, because what was it?
5874320	5881600	Oops, not the intro playing again. Was it the Clue game or something? There's some official
5881600	5886720	license thing out there. I think it's the Clue game. Sophia looks nothing like Sophia,
5887440	5892000	and I think it's because they probably couldn't get the estate of Estelle Getty to sign on to it.
5892640	5899120	So whether it's a tied up in logistics thing or they really just didn't want to be associated
5899120	5904240	with it or whatever the reason is. Anyway, my point is never announce these things this far
5904240	5908400	in advance unless you're ready to drop the game on the internet tomorrow. And it's a once on the
5908400	5912880	internet, always on the internet type of situation because I feel like this is going to get cease and
5912880	5918560	desisted. And they're going to have to change those characters into Grandma RPG, you know,
5918560	5923520	with nondescript older, you know, which we'll all know what it is wink wink nudge, but
5923520	5928000	well, I mean, if they give them guns, and that would suffice for one of our dreams.
5928000	5932560	That is that is okay, but okay, but Golden Girls will win.
5933360	5940560	Hey, I'd be into that. That's for sure. Ah, some comments and chat Zen monkey with some lore.
5941440	5945680	I think they did a popular Golden Girls episode with a clown. I think Dorothy's husband was
5945680	5950560	dressed like a clown or something. I'm sure they got Stan. In fact, that is a image that's coming
5950560	5956560	to my mind to stand in a clown outfit because it's a really, you know, funny image when she's
5956560	5964720	talking about her ex. So anyway, uh, let's see. Fifth Dream says olden gals. Yeah, that just
5964720	5968960	changed the name a little bit. Rhetortainment points out there's a reason why the Golden Girls
5968960	5973200	Chia pet doesn't look like any of the Golden Girls. They'd have to pay the Estator. Yeah,
5973200	5978480	it's exactly that type of thing for sure. So and everybody in chat is like,
5978480	5984640	just base it off of Golden Palace instead. That's true. If they can't get the estate of
5985440	5990240	Bea Arthur to sign on, they sure could. They'd have to get who was it? Was it Cheech
5990240	5997120	from Cheech and Chong was in that as well. And then one other well known actor today.
5997120	6003680	Was it Don Cheadle was in that? I want to say yes, Don Cheadle was in that. Yes, that's it.
6003680	6009440	So. All right. Moving on. Yeah, I would expect you would know these things Loki because I know
6009440	6013600	your wife has made you watch them all. I have never watched Golden Palace. Really?
6013600	6017680	Actually, you know, I take that back. I may have seen it on TV like when it was actually on like
6017680	6022240	a long time ago, but I remember it when it was actually on TV. We used to watch like,
6022240	6028160	we used to watch Golden Girls that I think my grandparents house or maybe watch it at home too.
6028160	6032960	I don't know. But it was like a staple. It was definitely something we watched when it was on
6032960	6037680	like actually airing on TV. And I'm pretty sure that we watched at least I've seen like
6037680	6043120	a an episode of Golden Palace. It was only on for one season. Golden Palace was essentially the
6043120	6047600	eighth season of Golden Girls without Bea Arthur. You know, it's just yeah, it's very,
6047600	6051520	very different. That's why I didn't do it was on a different network. It wasn't on NBC was on CBS.
6054960	6061360	Yeah, no, I was just gonna say with that I was gonna say Golden Girls was on for so long. It
6061360	6067040	was on for like seven years that by the time they got to Golden Palace, it was like 92.
6067040	6071360	So that's around the time at least for me, I was like a freshman, sophomore in high school by the
6071360	6077680	time you know that happened. So I wasn't that young when that came out. So that was our staple
6077680	6084720	in designing women. Oh, and that was the night that the lights went out. Well before it was a
6084720	6089760	Drag Race monologue lip sync. But if they were going to pick any monologue to be a lip sync on
6089760	6097040	that television program, that is the one to do so I will give them that. So now now I just now I
6097040	6104320	can't even see like, what was her name? It wasn't Delta Burke. It was. Oh, my God, the other star
6104320	6112240	that show. I can't remember her name. Dixie Carter. Dixie Carter. Yeah, yeah. Um, I now I
6112240	6118240	see Monet X Change doing it in my mind. I don't even see Dixie Carter doing it. All right.
6118880	6123760	I mean, I will say when when someone says the the night the lights went out of Georgia, I think of
6123760	6129920	Vicki Lawrence. Yes, there is that too. I know that because that was the staple in my household
6129920	6138000	was mama's family. And my mother loved, loved, loved Carol Burnett and everything associated
6138000	6144400	with it. Vicki Lawrence's rendition of that song is just like, gives me chills. Oh, yeah. All
6144400	6148800	right. Let's move on. That was it. That was it for the last story. I can't believe I put that
6148800	6154960	story last. Yes. All right. No, I will. I'm not like it's just it's funny, like how many times
6154960	6161200	that was sent to me. But I, I don't like I get to the point where I appreciate that those sorts of
6161200	6166320	things make people think of me. I do appreciate it. All right. Let's get to the listener round
6166320	6172080	table. If you would like to email us participate at OrangeLawnTrader.com or you'd like to call us
6172080	6177520	by joining our green room over on Discord vog network.com slash discord if you'd like to join
6177520	6182560	our Discord server. Or we can just reminisce about 80s TV shows like y'all are doing in chat. But
6182560	6188000	seriously, anything you want to bring up as well we can talk about here. I just want to confirm I
6188000	6193040	don't think we have emails tonight just confirming that. Okay, so I thought we had junk. We had Oh,
6193040	6196560	yay junk. My favorite. Maybe it's time to change the address again. I don't know.
6197120	6202560	Um, no, we don't get that much junk. No, it was it was bad when we changed it the first time it was
6202560	6210720	bad, but it's not so bad anymore. Let's see. Michigan says, you know, I never knew Vicki
6210720	6215200	Lawrence was the one who originally sang that song. I feel dumb now thinking it was Reba.
6215200	6219920	I thought there was someone before Vicki even. Or I thought it was a old old song.
6221200	6225280	Yeah, it's supposed to be an older song. Yeah. I think Vicki just had like a
6227360	6233920	very successful version of it. All right, so the it was a southern gothic murder ballad written in
6233920	6242560	1972. By Bobby Russell and recorded by his then wife Vicki Lawrence. Hers is the original.
6242560	6248160	Really? I thought there was a version before. Okay. How about that? All right.
6249040	6252640	And then it was covered by Reba McEntire in 1991. Right.
6252640	6260240	Yeah, whenever I think a Reba, I'm only gonna think of fancy. That is the definitive Reba
6260240	6267440	song for me. I used to have a hat. I miss my hat that I got in Vegas. So you know Reba
6267440	6273120	played the Vegas show that was at the Celine amphitheater that Adele's in now, right? Reba
6273120	6277360	had a show there for a little bit. And when I was in Vegas, we didn't get to see the show sadly,
6277360	6281920	but there's always the souvenir shop. So I bought a hat. It was a cool little black hat. You might
6281920	6288800	remember this. It said fancy on the hat. I love that hat. Unfortunately, the fancy lettering
6288800	6295200	started to tear off. It was no good anymore. So cheaply made hat. I know who did the other
6295200	6301120	version. Tanya Tucker did one with alternate lyrics. Ah, maybe I was thinking of Tanya Tucker.
6301120	6309200	Okay. Yeah. Anyway. All right. And there's your country music history of the day. Thank you.
6312080	6317920	sj100matt says we need a TV 8090 sitcom special episode. We still need Orange Launch Fudio.
6317920	6321440	We got to make that happen. We've been talking about that for a while. I guess I need to lock
6321440	6325520	down a date with my co hosts here. Now that I'm back from the cruise and all that stuff. So
6327040	6334560	we'll make that happen. Yeah. All right. What other special shows would you like to see here
6334560	6341120	at VOG Network? Because the the special cast on the cruise was fun. I'll bring grandpa back for
6341120	6346880	something else. He was surprisingly well behaved compared to his days on Hoard House. I think he
6346880	6353840	I think he got the memo that some things have changed. He's mellowed some. I wouldn't say
6353840	6360080	mellowed but he's he is he's adjusted his digs on me. He was he still gave me hell but he adjusted
6360080	6367280	them appropriately. So it's good. By the way, Ron Shawn I can do an 80s style music. Just wait.
6367920	6372560	Okay. We have an anniversary. So coming up in June, maybe we'll we'll play around with some
6372560	6379680	of that. All right. Anyway. All right. Well, not a lot of other activity coming in. So you know
6379680	6383440	what I think I think even though it's a little shorter tonight, I think we've hit the end of the
6383440	6389360	show. This is what it is. I know I just got here. I know. There's stuff on TV that has people's
6389360	6394800	attention to I don't know if you heard about that whole thing going on tonight. So the Oscars are
6394800	6400640	tonight. Oh, shit. I don't pay attention. I know we will we've been doing this for over 20 years.
6400640	6407680	So we kind of but you know, I important I noticed the nights that big things are on TV. It's also
6407680	6412560	to be fair. It's also the last of us finale, which I don't know who counter program that on the
6412560	6417920	Oscars, but maybe because they have a lot of on demand watchers for that. So there's that. All
6417920	6422800	right. Looking for voice talent. Let's go around and get everybody's final thought for the night.
6422800	6425440	First off, I'm gonna say thank you so much for listening to Orange Launch Radio. Thank
6425440	6429360	you for tuning in. We are the show where every gamer has a voice but to get more voices out
6429360	6433040	there. We need them. So tell a friend or two about the show help us spread the word. A nice
6433040	6438000	five star review on a site like iTunes goes an awful long way. We appreciate all of that as well
6438000	6443760	wherever it is you listen to show Spotify. Help us spread the word. We appreciate it. With that,
6443760	6446960	we'll get to final thoughts star Sakura. Sorry, you missed most of the show, but I hope you had
6446960	6452560	fun with the stream. I did. And it was nice to finally get to participate in that. But I'm
6452560	6458320	going to be hopping back into the fog immediately. You're still going tonight. So yeah, I am. Hey,
6458320	6464320	you gotta have consistency, right? Yeah, it's important. And rank reset is tomorrow. So I want
6464320	6471840	to do as much bullshit gaming while I'm eerie one as I can. Sounds good. All right. All right. Well,
6471840	6477760	have a great stream tonight. Later, taters. And remember, bullshit shenanigans. It's a thing.
6477760	6480640	Okay, later. Loki, your final thought for tonight?
6483040	6488480	My final thought is it's nice to see everything everywhere all at once sweeping the Oscars.
6490480	6494160	Did it win? Did it win the big one? Or do we not know? Not yet, but it's won like,
6494800	6501920	four or five categories already. What was it? Best Supporting Actress, Best Supporting Actor,
6502800	6509360	uh, Best Screenplay. And there's something else. I missed it.
6511200	6515280	Let's see, my final thought for tonight. I guess I'll plug my own streaming. Next week,
6515280	6519920	I'm going to stream on Tuesday and Thursday. Tuesday, I'm hoping to finish No Man's Sky
6519920	6524880	Expedition 9. I don't know if I can actually do it all in one night. So we'll try our best to get it
6524880	6529360	done on Tuesday. If not, maybe I'll have to do a bonus stream. I was gonna do a bonus stream over
6529360	6535440	the weekend. But if the Diablo 4 beta is this weekend, then no. I don't know if we can stream
6535440	6540240	the Diablo 4 beta. I imagine if it's an open beta, we must be able to because I'll be playing
6540240	6545280	way too much of that this weekend. Believe it. So if they allow me to stream it, I will. If I'm not
6545280	6551600	allowed to, then I won't. Thursday, I'm gonna play more theater. The World Ends With You DLC will be
6551600	6556480	out on Thursday. So I look forward to that. Otherwise, I hope everybody has a great week.
6556480	6560800	Please be safe if you partake in St. Patrick's Day shenanigans. Although for some reason,
6560800	6564480	it seems like a lot of that happened this past weekend. Like they died the river in Chicago
6564480	6569680	this weekend when St. Patrick's Day is on a Friday. I don't know. They must do it on a Saturday
6569680	6577120	or something. So yeah, I'll be curious to see what shenanigans happen on Friday. But please be safe,
6577120	6580880	y'all. And have a good one. That's gonna do it for another episode of Orange Laundry. Have a great
6580880	6586320	week. We will see you next time. And be safe, everyone. Have a wonderful night. Bye.
6610880	6626640	Those of the staff of orange lounge radio nor fog network, but you know, they were all still true.
