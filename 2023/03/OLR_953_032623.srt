1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,760
Video gaming merchandise has been an ever-growing thing, but thus far you haven't often seen

2
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:16,680
a game's name in a grocery or other common personal goods store.

3
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:21,280
But now, a 1980s stalwart and a 2010s breakout are both landing on more shelves.

4
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:24,680
One of them is part of a balanced breakfast, and the other keeps you fresh, clean, and

5
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:25,680
smooth.

6
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,280
Guess which games, and guess which products.

7
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:30,040
We're the ThinkGeek, and you're not going to see these on GameStop shelves.

8
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:32,960
Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you which

9
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,000
of these and about the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now on the show

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,800
where every gamer has a voice.

11
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:44,280
Hello my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show

12
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,600
where every gamer has a voice.

13
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:55,040
It is Orange Lounge Radio, and we are live here once again with episode number 953 of

14
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:59,000
our show for tonight, March the 26th of 2023.

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,120
My name is Rob Roberts, and I am joined week, after week, after week, after week, after

16
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:06,060
week by my co-hosts.

17
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,240
Say hello to Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.

18
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,240
What's up?

19
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,800
Hi, how are you doing?

20
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,160
I'm all right.

21
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:16,080
Did you hear, by the way, have you heard the latest news about my husband?

22
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,080
Something about a ban?

23
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,280
Yes, he's in Twitch jail right now.

24
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,280
Why?

25
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:28,880
Okay, so he loves to stream games with mods, right?

26
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:36,200
So he was running a mod for Final Fantasy 7 Remake that was showing Cloud running around

27
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,700
in a jockstrap.

28
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:43,440
So his little booty was hanging out, and somebody decided that those assets were too hot for

29
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:47,640
TV, and so he was delivered with a three-day ban in the middle of the stream with four

30
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:52,080
viewers watching, which, here's the thing.

31
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,680
Diablo 4 is like all the rage right now.

32
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:58,960
Don't get me wrong, I love Diablo 4, but half of Twitch is streaming that limited access

33
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,420
beta right now, right?

34
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:06,220
And all of that death, dismemberment, violence, destruction, decapitation, you name it, all

35
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:07,880
going on in that game.

36
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:13,920
But, pun intended, Allen decides to show a risque mod, and he gets banned.

37
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,540
Now look, I'm not complaining about what Twitch is doing, because Allen knew he was toeing

38
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:19,540
the line.

39
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:23,500
He knew it was a little risky what he was doing, so he's a big boy and can take the

40
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,740
big boy punishment.

41
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:28,340
But I am pointing out, there's a double standard here going on, folks.

42
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:29,340
And I-

43
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,340
How many years have I been saying that?

44
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:32,820
Oh, forever.

45
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:39,720
And how much do you want to bet if that mod had been a lady, it would not have been quick

46
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,060
to have been reported?

47
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:42,060
And that's just-

48
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,060
No, it probably would have been-

49
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:44,060
Facts are facts.

50
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:45,060
Our bodies are policed a lot more.

51
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:49,700
It would have been like, you know, that needs to go in the hot tub streaming section.

52
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:54,060
I mean, this is in the wrong section, just letting you know.

53
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:55,060
So-

54
00:02:55,060 --> 00:03:01,280
Our bodies are policed more and sexualized more, so I'd be surprised if it went on longer.

55
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:07,100
So it's just, I don't know, I can't help but think maybe even somebody we know or somebody

56
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:11,040
had actually reported that, but I like to believe that the universe has a nice little

57
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,340
way of dealing with those types of people.

58
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:14,480
So I will just kind of, you know-

59
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,480
It's an auto-detect algorithm.

60
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,480
What's that?

61
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,120
Or it could have been an auto-detect.

62
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,280
It wasn't his first time running that mod.

63
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,280
It was a few streams in.

64
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,160
So, I mean, and again, I'm not mad about, and neither is he, about what happened.

65
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,860
It's just one of those things where it's like, it's just a ridiculous double standard in

66
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:35,640
our society that the violence, you know, and even when it comes to Twitch or whatever it

67
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:43,600
is, an R-rated movie or what have you allows a certain amount of risqueness to it that

68
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,400
for whatever reason Twitch does not mirror.

69
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,920
And that's, you know, again, that's okay, but I just, it's a bit of a double standard.

70
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:54,540
I think the violence should be policed just as much if we're going to do that, so.

71
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:57,920
That's pretty much been the cry of women everywhere.

72
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,880
I mean, having our bodies policed when violence is certainly allowed everywhere.

73
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,880
Yeah.

74
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:04,880
I agree.

75
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,120
Anyway, also say hello.

76
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,120
Sorry.

77
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,400
I know you heard his voice in there too, but I also want to-

78
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:13,640
That has nothing to do with body positivity, I'm just saying.

79
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,640
Whatever happens.

80
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:19,360
The two should not be, should be remotely combined.

81
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:24,120
I feel like I might know what angle he's taking with that comment is that like, to me, I read

82
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,720
that comment to be like, it's just a butt.

83
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,800
And that's how, that's like art butts, whatever, like, and that's how I kind of look at it

84
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,800
is that it's just a butt, people.

85
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,800
It's just a butt.

86
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,600
Positively- It's not even a real butt.

87
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,520
Is a different thing than just someone showing their ass.

88
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,520
No.

89
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,520
So.

90
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,520
Anyway, hello, Techmaster Loki.

91
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,520
How are you?

92
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,520
I'm fine.

93
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,520
Yeah.

94
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,520
And how's your week been?

95
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,520
Yeah, it's been all right.

96
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,520
Yeah.

97
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,840
What's that game playing behind you tonight?

98
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,840
Red Dead Redemption 2.

99
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:53,720
Oh, is that, so I thought it was Red Dead Redemption, but I wasn't positive.

100
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,720
Okay.

101
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,720
Fair enough.

102
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,720
All right.

103
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,720
Let's see.

104
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,700
We do tape live, of course, every Sunday night at nine o'clock Eastern, six o'clock Pacific

105
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:06,520
at the Voice of Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash vog network, right after the Bobby Blackwolf

106
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,980
show.

107
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:12,740
And if you are watching along with the show, you can chat along with us.

108
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:18,020
So I'm sorry, I'm laughing at a comment about something that happened before the podcast.

109
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:25,660
And yes, the little joke bump that plays at the beginning when we go live, it was a joke

110
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:30,300
about AI tonight, and I'm getting asked for screenshots about what we actually got the

111
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,500
AI to say.

112
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:35,940
And yes, I'm happy to send those over later after the show, I'll post them on Discord.

113
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:36,940
Let's see.

114
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:37,940
Yeah.

115
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:42,180
Dark Tetsuya appreciates the joke about assets, yes.

116
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:47,920
Questbuster talking about the AI joke, a Chinese company actually did appoint an AI as a CEO.

117
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,960
Not joking, really.

118
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,620
I had not heard about that.

119
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:56,140
I'd be very curious, because this is all the rage now, and we even have a story later on

120
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:57,140
in the show about it this week.

121
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:59,500
I'd be very curious to kind of know more about that.

122
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:05,060
So anyway, for the sake of the podcast listeners, one of the quote unquote jokes I put in there

123
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:07,220
as I asked, it was Google Bard.

124
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:12,700
And I asked, I said, do you think Bobby Kotick should be CEO of Activision?

125
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:18,100
And it actually spit out a response and said, these are all the things that he's done wrong.

126
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:23,340
And for these reasons, including basically his rampant, all the sexual harassment that

127
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:26,180
went on Activision Blizzard while he was over, he should be fired.

128
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:30,860
And I was like, Google Bard, smarter than the board at Activision Blizzard.

129
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:34,260
I think an actual turd would make a better CEO.

130
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,260
Agree.

131
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,580
Actual AI would make a better CEO.

132
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:43,760
No, no, I'm saying I can dig a turd out of my cat box and maybe a P clump, and that would

133
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,660
do better than him.

134
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:46,660
I agree.

135
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:48,380
All right.

136
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:53,500
Let's get into our official story at the top here before we get into our gaming weeks.

137
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,500
Let's talk about this.

138
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:57,700
This is interesting because it kind of has to do with, you know, we've been talking about

139
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:02,940
Diablo 4 and a lot of games that we play right now in this day and age are always online.

140
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:07,900
And this used to be something you would get a lot more pushback on, but that kind of seems

141
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,400
to have faded a lot in the last few years.

142
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,180
I kind of wanted to dissect that a little bit, but first let's talk about like what's

143
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:13,980
happening with the whole back and forth on that.

144
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:15,960
Loki, I'll turn it over to you.

145
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:20,940
So basically they had announced that Redfall was going to have a, I think it has a single

146
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:25,120
player campaign and that it's still always online as well.

147
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:29,140
So if you wanted to play, you know, single player, then you're stuck being connected

148
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:30,220
to the internet.

149
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:34,700
And of course people were not happy with that and let their voices be heard.

150
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:41,220
And so because of that, the game director Harvey Smith said that, you know, they have,

151
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:46,420
they've listened to the players and have a lot of empathy for folks who don't have consistent

152
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:47,420
internet connections.

153
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:52,060
Because we do take complaints about always online with a lot of empathy, we listen and

154
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:55,140
we've already started work to address this.

155
00:07:55,140 --> 00:08:02,020
And in the future, we have some things like to encrypt your saves and do a bunch of UI

156
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:03,020
work to support it.

157
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:08,140
And we're looking into, I'm not supposed to promise anything, but we're looking into working

158
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:13,620
actively towards fixing that in the future.

159
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:17,640
So there, yeah, I don't know.

160
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:21,020
So why did it require an online connection in the first place?

161
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:26,780
Well, I guess, you know, in-game purchases, it says always online allowed us to do some

162
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:28,980
accessibility stuff.

163
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:31,500
I'm really, my eyes really big there.

164
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,020
It allows us for telemetries.

165
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:40,140
Like if everybody's fallen off ladders and dying, you know, then we can go tweak the

166
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:41,140
ladder code.

167
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:44,820
I mean, I don't know.

168
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:48,880
I don't think that other games don't necessarily do that.

169
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:55,860
Like you could have that without being always online because people would report bugs to

170
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:57,960
you and then you go and fix those bugs.

171
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:01,080
Like that's kind of what you do with that.

172
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:05,740
Like you wouldn't, like, are you really going to be looking at all that data?

173
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:08,100
I doubt it.

174
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:11,260
A comment from Bobby Blackwolf in our chat saying they've been doing this telemetry stuff

175
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:12,260
forever though.

176
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,820
It doesn't need to be always online.

177
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:16,340
They just upload data at other times.

178
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:20,740
So but Bobby says they do look at that data.

179
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:25,780
I wonder if it's, you know, I think sometimes we have the impression they don't look at

180
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:28,620
the data piece by piece and they probably don't look at the data piece by piece.

181
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:32,220
They look at trends and big, big clumps of data.

182
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:37,300
Yeah, they would like, they probably would use it to further back up, like say someone's

183
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:40,460
like saying, hey, you know, going back to the ladder issue.

184
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:43,540
Yeah, I'm having an issue, you know, being able to climb that ladder.

185
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:48,500
They can then go look at, you know, that ladder object or whatever and seeing people interact

186
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:52,960
with it and can get a better idea of like, is this an isolated issue?

187
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,420
Is this something that all the players are experiencing?

188
00:09:55,420 --> 00:10:00,940
Yeah, it helps with further bolster and I guess prioritize errors that they need to

189
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:05,220
fix or tweaks or rebalances, whatever that type of stuff.

190
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:09,580
But if that were the case, that all the games are doing that, which they're not, then everything

191
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:11,020
would be always online.

192
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:13,460
So I think there's other ways around that.

193
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:14,460
Yeah.

194
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:18,260
Comments in chat as Joe and Matt says, it's all about keeping the game from being pirated

195
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:19,260
as well.

196
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:23,740
You know, I was just thinking the other day, I don't hear a lot about torrents anymore.

197
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:25,660
I'm sure I'm not being completely naive.

198
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:27,540
Yes, I know it's all still out there, folks.

199
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:32,740
I'm not like completely naive, but I feel like a lot of that isn't as like piracy doesn't

200
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:36,900
feel as mainstream now as it used to feel.

201
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:40,940
And I don't know if a lot of that is because of like streaming and the capabilities that

202
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:41,940
is brought.

203
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:46,780
Like I, and here's the thing, you know, if you want to take piracy way, way back to like

204
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:54,580
the late nineties, early aughts when it was, yeah, LimeWire, Napster, what was the other

205
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:55,580
big one?

206
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:59,060
But there were all these ways to, you know, the peer to peer file transferring and all

207
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:02,400
that stuff where we were basically pirating music.

208
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:09,600
But then what happened to the industry iTunes happened, iTunes happened and it didn't completely

209
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,920
shut that down, but boy, oh boy, did it scale it way back and sure.

210
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:16,480
There was still torrents of, you know, a CD quality albums and things like that.

211
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,060
And that all is still out there, I'm sure.

212
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:23,000
But especially not just iTunes, but now that we've taken that and transitioned into Apple

213
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,840
music, Spotify, Pandora, you name it, all these, you know, what's the title, you know,

214
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:33,660
all these, you know, different music streaming services, it's just not nearly as prevalent

215
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:39,600
because the option is still there to do these streamings and get that like instant gratification

216
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,360
of like, whatever it is you're looking for.

217
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,560
And a lot of streaming TV services seem to do this now, which is why I feel like there's

218
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,760
less and less of the piracy that's going on.

219
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,760
Yeah.

220
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:53,780
And I don't think that they have anything for like the Xbox series S or X right now

221
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:56,400
that there is like even a piracy scene for it.

222
00:11:56,400 --> 00:12:01,580
I mean, at some point, if they, you know, exploit the console in a way that they can

223
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:05,800
do that, then yeah, that might be a thing like the Xbox 360 is really bad.

224
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:09,640
But and I, again, I don't, I want to make sure I'm very clear on this.

225
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:12,360
I'm not naive to the fact that piracy still exists.

226
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,400
Of course it still exists and it's going on out there.

227
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:21,520
I'm just saying the percentage of average Joes and Janes and, you know, folks out there

228
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:25,760
that are participating in that seems to be lower.

229
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,760
I mean, that could be a confirmation bias or personal thing.

230
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,760
I don't know.

231
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:32,920
But I just, I feel like we're not, like even on like Twitter and social media, we don't

232
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:37,480
see people as brazen about posting that type of stuff anymore that we used to.

233
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:45,280
I feel like that level of the mainstreamization of piracy in a way is scaled back a little

234
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,400
bit, especially when it comes to games.

235
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,880
It just doesn't seem like it's as big of a threat as it used to be.

236
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:49,880
Yeah.

237
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:54,560
I think a lot of like Xbox right now, the closest thing that you have with that is just,

238
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:58,200
you know, there's stuff being run in the dev mode, but that's more like emulators and

239
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,200
stuff like that.

240
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:04,000
That's less, you know, I don't think anyone's actually pirating anything with that.

241
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I mean, obviously torrent stuff nowadays, TV shows, movies, that type of stuff for the

242
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,040
most part, software, maybe PC game piracy to a certain extent.

243
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:18,280
Although I would think that that's probably dropped down even still, although now that

244
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:23,800
games are going back up to $70, you know, even PC, that might kick back up again.

245
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:28,240
If the games can run offline, which a lot of them in this day and age don't anymore,

246
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,240
it seems like.

247
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:37,220
Well, I mean, there's patches for everything, so I wouldn't say that, yeah, like your typical

248
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:41,600
retail game may not run, you know, always online, but I mean, we've learned things like

249
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,600
remember SimCity?

250
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,760
Oh yeah, it's impossible for that to run.

251
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,760
Good point.

252
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,760
Good point.

253
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,760
Except it wasn't.

254
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:49,760
Point taken.

255
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:54,160
It's just interesting to me because I feel like, okay, so I'm also looking at a lot of

256
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,920
things through the lens of this Diablo 4 beta that's going on this weekend, and you know,

257
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:03,440
there's a limited beta last weekend, and obviously I'm a big Diablo fan, but Diablo 4, as far

258
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:07,240
as I know, and chat, please correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't see how I am on this

259
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:11,480
because the queue issues are a big issue to get into the game, but Diablo 4 isn't always

260
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:21,140
online game, as was Diablo 3, and Diablo 3 got a lot of shit about always being online.

261
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:25,840
So much so that when the console versions of Diablo 3 came out, they were offline and

262
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,920
it was a selling point.

263
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:30,920
Now granted, Diablo 3 also had this huge problem.

264
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:34,300
Remember what Diablo 3 looks like today and what it looked like the day it launched are

265
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:37,960
very different products because the other thing Diablo 3 had that people did not like

266
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:43,360
was that real money auction house, hence the reason why it had to always be online.

267
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:48,880
Now Diablo 4 doesn't have a real money auction house because Activision Blizzard done learned

268
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:54,560
their lesson from that whole thing, but it does have cosmetics, the battle pass, a lot

269
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:59,480
of things that games as a service kind of have, although Blizzard swears up and down,

270
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:03,560
they're not going to tie that to content, so we'll see if they're true to their word

271
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:06,200
on all of that.

272
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:13,960
But I guess my point is, I feel like the buzz about Diablo 4 being always online, I'm not

273
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,660
seeing people complain about that.

274
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:21,760
Have we just gotten to a point here a decade later that we just assume that a lot of games

275
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:25,280
are going to require an online connection and we don't care as much about that anymore?

276
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,800
That's really the point I'm trying to get to.

277
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:31,340
Do we as gamers just accept that more games are just, they're always going to be online

278
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:34,120
because that's the way games are?

279
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:37,840
They're connected and whether that be because they're really trying to push multiplayer

280
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:43,360
or it's a game as a service and all the things that come with that, your battle passes, cosmetics,

281
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:49,760
your shops and all that, although single player games, the very first Ludicrous DLC was for

282
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:54,920
a single player game and that's Elder Scrolls Oblivion and the horse armor that set the

283
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,540
standard for all cosmetic DLC to follow.

284
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:01,440
That was a single player game, so you don't have to always have a game online to do that

285
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,200
type of stuff, but I digress.

286
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:07,580
I'm curious, what do you all think about this?

287
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:09,640
Do you think we as gamers accept this now?

288
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:12,080
Let me get some comments from chat.

289
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:17,240
Questbuster says, I accept that more games are always going to be online, but I don't

290
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,640
have to like it.

291
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,640
Fair enough.

292
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:24,240
Fifth Dream brings up a point about the annoyingness of games being online sometimes.

293
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:31,160
That rubber banding, even when you're soloing in, I think Diablo, oh, DIV, D4, why don't

294
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,160
you just put D4?

295
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:35,160
Why do you put the Roman numerals?

296
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,800
I was like, what's DIV?

297
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,160
Okay, I get it.

298
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,160
I get it.

299
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,160
I get it.

300
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,720
Even when you're soloing in D4 is eh.

301
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,560
So yeah, and then the monsters are that.

302
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,520
So yeah, there are some annoyances that come with the always online thing too, is that

303
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:50,800
like even when you're solo player, you're going to encounter issues.

304
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:55,480
Now I chalk a lot of these things up to the fact it's a beta and hopefully they iron some

305
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,040
of these things out before June.

306
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,520
I actually wasn't having a lot of problems with rubber banding though, to be quite honest.

307
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:05,640
I wasn't having, my problems seem to be more graphical in nature for high end stuff and

308
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:10,680
I actually took my graphics down a setting to get it to work, but I noticed they released

309
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:14,120
updated drivers and that might actually fix my issue.

310
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,120
I don't know.

311
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:20,640
But I am chalking a lot of this up to just, you know, the lovely parts of a beta.

312
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,080
But anyway, let me go back to the question at hand.

313
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:27,760
Do you think that we as gamers have just accepted that more and more games are going to be online?

314
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:31,240
Do any of my co-hosts have a standpoint on this?

315
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:35,840
I mean, if it makes sense, like in the sense of a game, like if it's it's a multiplayer game or

316
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:39,760
something like that, that requires all always online connection.

317
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:46,800
But I think for like a single player game where conceivable, there's no real reason to have that

318
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,080
type of connection.

319
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:52,760
It really shouldn't be because we've seen examples where this just fails.

320
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:57,040
Like Assassin's Creed had a lot of those games that were always online.

321
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:02,840
And when their authentication servers go down, well, hey, now you can't play your single player game.

322
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:07,200
You know, like that's really stupid to be designing a game like that.

323
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,160
And for what reason were they doing that?

324
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,960
Probably monetization.

325
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:16,000
You know, they'll probably make some excuse like, oh, it was telemetry, whatever, you know, like.

326
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:21,840
But in the end, like when those servers go down, then news reports go out about how, oh, hey, look

327
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,840
at this unnecessary thing that's going on.

328
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:30,320
Like it really. I don't think it's absolutely necessary to have an always online connection for things.

329
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:35,960
I know in the past it was because like, hey, this is one other way we're going to try to stave off piracy, which never worked.

330
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,120
It never did.

331
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,200
So. I don't know the reason.

332
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:45,120
Typically, the reason that they want to do that isn't for the benefit of the player.

333
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,880
It's for the benefit of the company and to make more money.

334
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,560
That's typically why they're doing it.

335
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,560
Hashtag blame telemetry.

336
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:58,240
All right. It's not telemetry, it's usually not telemetry, it is monetization.

337
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:02,280
Like it typically is the reason why that they want that always online.

338
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:09,600
So that so that you nasty cheaters out there can't get that item that you're supposed to be paying five dollars for or something like that.

339
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,160
Like it's that it's about control.

340
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:15,080
Did you want to elaborate, Jamin, before I go to chat?

341
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:20,080
Well, I mean, I would hope I would have had a turn to say my piece.

342
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:28,240
Of course. But I I'm always against the always online thing, except in the case of multiplayer.

343
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:40,360
I think that if you're trying to check for like a cheat, then there should be like an initial, you know, check for, you know, any bad stuff that shouldn't be there and then let you play the game.

344
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:47,440
I mean. I back in the day, there were other ways to know if the game was pirated.

345
00:19:47,440 --> 00:20:02,520
I mean, if if it was like you would get to a point of the game and you couldn't play it because it wasn't official software or it would come up with a message that says, hey, thank you for trying the game by the full version, you know, because they knew about it.

346
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,320
You know, it's.

347
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,880
It's it's it's unnecessary.

348
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:12,200
We we were fine without it before, you know, I.

349
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:16,240
It's just about control, it's controlling their product.

350
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,880
It's it's loss prevention.

351
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:22,120
It's I mean, and yeah, monetization can be a big part of it.

352
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:32,800
But in the end, it's wanting to make sure that that their asset is protected, that they're actually making the money on the asset and not, you know, the copies are not there.

353
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:45,960
And who cares if somebody cheats in single player that used it that that was old gaming was cheating in single player, you know, and we can sit here in our fucking rocking chairs being like, I remember when I used up

354
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:53,680
up, down, down, left, right, to be able to get through the first stage, Gradius and get my Contra lives, except for Jamie, who's saying they're going, I don't need the 30 lives code.

355
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,040
Oh, come on. I suck at Gradius.

356
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,200
Sorry, I was transitioning into Contra there, but yes.

357
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:04,680
Oh, well, Contra, I don't know anyone.

358
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:12,000
OK, I take that back. Dan's good at Contra, but like I actually do not enjoy playing Contra for the record.

359
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:19,400
I enjoy playing it for a little bit, but I, you know, it's a fun throwback, you know, anyway.

360
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:22,040
I've never actually enjoyed playing a Contra game.

361
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:28,280
We have some really good insight from chat and I want to get some of these comments here because I think this is really interesting.

362
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:33,040
Fixation Gaze in chat says the cool thing about cheating has died.

363
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:36,240
Modding now feels more like how cheat codes used to be.

364
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,480
Well, it also kind of feels like that people are selling cheat codes now.

365
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:50,840
You know, why allow you to do up, up, down, down 30 lives when I can sell you a life kit that has extra lives in it, which is what a lot of games do these days, right?

366
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:55,400
I thought this was a really insightful comment, actually.

367
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:58,440
This is just about a gold star level comment to me.

368
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,680
This is silver star level.

369
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:04,200
It's from zenmonkey11 who says zoomers accept all that crap.

370
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:07,960
They grew up with consoles that connect to the Internet, so they don't care.

371
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:12,760
I care. That's why I don't buy always online games if I can help it.

372
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:19,840
I actually thought that was very interesting because you even think about that term zoomers and how that generation got that term.

373
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:32,200
And that's because of, you know, the fact that we've got a whole generation of kids who've grown up now with a couple of years in online school and Zoom school and being connected and finding connections for birthday parties.

374
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,760
I mean, we all had to go through it with the pandemic lockdowns.

375
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:38,760
But, you know, now especially we have a generation that's grown up on that.

376
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:41,320
So it almost kind of leads to that whole thought of.

377
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:52,120
And again, I'm not trying to make it like an age, I'm not trying to be like I'm not trying to make broad stroke judgments based solely on age.

378
00:22:52,120 --> 00:23:04,320
However, you know, is it possible that younger folks, because there's that always online connection in these other ways, have just grown up to accept that there is going to

379
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:12,560
always be a sense of always being connected online because sometimes, as we've unfortunately learned, that may be all the connection there is at some points.

380
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,360
I don't know. I thought that was a very interesting perspective.

381
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,960
Some other comments in chat.

382
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:25,640
Let's see. Sean322 says, I don't mind always being online as long as someone doesn't pick up the phone and disconnect me.

383
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,400
Oh, sorry. Flashback from the AOL dial up days.

384
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:28,920
Yes, yes.

385
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:35,280
SheHulk10 says, if the world is ever changing, then online single player is fun.

386
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:39,320
You know, and when it comes to like Diablo 4, I don't mind it.

387
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:44,560
I like the sense of like the world being alive and seeing other people and all of that stuff.

388
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:50,760
So if there's kind of like a point that makes sense, I don't just hate it on its merits alone.

389
00:23:51,080 --> 00:24:04,440
But I also like it's kind of it's one of those weird things where like, as a gamer who plays and consumes a lot of games is like you kind of know when a game needs to be online to enhance it.

390
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:14,560
And when the only reason it's having you online is for telemetry, quote unquote, so I'm using my quoting fingers to represent for the online shop is what I really mean.

391
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:24,640
And I feel like a lot of our bullshit detectors are very strong and we can sense when a game doesn't really need to be online and how that can be very frustrating.

392
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:36,360
So completely, by the way, agree with Fixie in chat in response to what E3vil said, I'm just going to say evil.

393
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:40,040
Kids know how to fucking read a book, OK, dude?

394
00:24:41,040 --> 00:25:04,600
Kids, the letters on an e-reader are the same as the letters in a book, it's just a matter of convenience, that makes zero sense to me, I don't get I don't get why why you say that, OK, but how hard is it if I can turn a page, there's they know how to turn a page on a book.

395
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:16,480
There's these there's these clickbaity articles out there that talk about I know where the school of thought comes from, and it's the clickbait social media culture is that there's that clickbaity article about that.

396
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:22,040
The five year old is handed a book and they try to do this to the book and I'm doing a swiping motion with my finger.

397
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:26,280
They try to do this to the book because they don't understand because they've never seen a physical book before.

398
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:29,400
And these are clickbaity articles that are all over Facebook and social media.

399
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:32,840
I see where that is coming from.

400
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:33,520
I do.

401
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,520
But it doesn't take.

402
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:40,560
But also, yes, to your point and what Fixie saying, it takes 30 seconds to figure it out.

403
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:47,160
But boy, oh boy, do the parents love to tell the entire neighborhood about that 30 seconds about their kid trying to swipe the book.

404
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,120
Like they're bragging about their kid not being able to figure something out.

405
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:52,960
That's what it is.

406
00:25:53,880 --> 00:26:06,040
I stopped trying to make kids look stupid or foolish or unable to figure out earlier technology or things like that.

407
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:06,960
It's ridiculous.

408
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:09,280
Kids are smarter than we give them credit for.

409
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:12,400
You know, we were we were all there, too.

410
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,840
We were smarter than we were given credit for.

411
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:20,920
Let's just stop spreading this really toxic stereotype.

412
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:25,640
You know, it's it's it's trying to do an us versus them thing.

413
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:29,200
Every generation tries to do it and it should just be us.

414
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:34,120
And we have responsibility to help them and they're going to be the next generation.

415
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:34,800
It's just us.

416
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,520
And that has been something.

417
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,400
Unfortunately, I don't disagree with Shane at all.

418
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:43,840
But unfortunately, this has been a thing that's been around for generations.

419
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:47,680
You know, I think think back to TV shows from the 70s.

420
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,440
Kids say the darndest things.

421
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:55,600
And it's all about the wacky, wild things kids do.

422
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:06,600
I mean, all right, so think back to like 1984 with a Mac in front of you, you know, you didn't know what to do with the computer the first time you saw one.

423
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,880
It's like, is this is this a typewriter?

424
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:15,880
Yeah, but you figured it out, you know, sitting down with your first video game console.

425
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,680
You're not going to be instantly good at it.

426
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,640
You got to figure it out.

427
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:22,280
And the example with the kids with the rotary phone.

428
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:26,160
I mean, they're not stupid.

429
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:31,080
They can they figure it out eventually that, OK, you turn the thing to make the thing go.

430
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,320
You know, they know what a receiver is, right?

431
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:37,000
Because it you see it in a movie.

432
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:43,120
No, it's obvious it is one has ear, one has mouth.

433
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,080
It's like your headset.

434
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:48,520
And even if you hold it backwards, it still kind of works.

435
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,160
I know that from being a kid.

436
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:59,360
All right, let's move on and talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing this week.

437
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,200
And I will start with Dark Sakura.

438
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:06,280
I have, of course, been playing Dead by Daylight.

439
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:16,400
I, I, well, yeah, I played Marvel Midnight Suns last night because I got the wrong controller again.

440
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,760
I mean, I have a use for it, so it's not that big of a deal.

441
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:24,520
But I bought another controller to see if I can play Star Ocean next weekend.

442
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:29,440
I did all of my testing with Osha Berry Proteus.

443
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:34,680
So there has been some Proteus and Jackie Crush in my life also in the week.

444
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:51,760
And then I played, of course, my stupid wordscapes, because I actually I'm getting to the point now where I'm solving this, the quote, super hard puzzles in 10 to 15 seconds.

445
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:55,520
And and then sometimes my brain is just so like, what?

446
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,520
What's this word?

447
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,360
You know, so I'm going back and forth with it.

448
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:09,920
And also playing more Beatlemania Pinball because it's fucking fun.

449
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:13,040
We have a Dracula, but I've never liked that table.

450
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:19,080
We, I played something else.

451
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:22,720
And for the life of me, I cannot think of what the crap it was.

452
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:27,720
Now, maybe I'm just thinking of Parodius and Jackie Crush for Super Famicom.

453
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:34,680
But yeah, that's been I'm dipping back into some of my old school loves.

454
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:42,840
And again, if if anyone doesn't know, Jackie Crush is the third in the Crush series of pinball games.

455
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:46,240
So there's Alien Crush.

456
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,600
What? Wait, why can't my brain think of the other Alien one?

457
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,040
Devil.

458
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,400
Devil's Crush.

459
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:55,200
And then Jackie Crush brain farts.

460
00:29:55,880 --> 00:30:02,400
And I'm actually thinking about going back to playing Demon's Tilt just on like, you know, off nights.

461
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:06,080
I really it's such a good spiritual successor.

462
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,040
It's such a good game.

463
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:17,800
Oh, and I've been sort of laughing to myself about the Dead Hard nerf and the the joke that Behavior made about nerfed the pig.

464
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:21,320
And really, they just gave her an improved one of her perks.

465
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,560
Because Behavior gets the memes.

466
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,240
That was pretty funny.

467
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,160
Oh, yeah, and the circle of healing nerf.

468
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,080
There's that too.

469
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:38,560
But that one I'm kind of I'm not like all up in arms about it because I was never a booner.

470
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:43,720
The slower healing irritated about and I can get into that.

471
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:54,560
I wish I'd put it into like my chosen story thing because they they put out a big developer update with a lot of changes that have people losing their shit on the Internet.

472
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,840
Because they always lose their shit on the Internet.

473
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:03,760
I'll be right back by continue on Loki when yeah, I'll tell you guys what's going on in a minute.

474
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:05,040
Okay, okay.

475
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:18,160
Well, I mean, just in a nutshell, the big ones that people are irritated about are the Dead Hard nerf, which means you have you now have to have unhook somebody to get the benefit from.

476
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:18,680
I don't know.

477
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:21,840
I hate Dead Hard and I've never used it on purpose except for like twice.

478
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:26,200
And then the the circle of healing.

479
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:29,960
Yeah, still it now requires that you have a medkit to be able to self care.

480
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:30,920
I think that's ridiculous.

481
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:37,160
And then slowing down the rate of of healing with a medkit is also ridiculous.

482
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,320
Whatever behavior.

483
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:43,080
All right.

484
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:45,640
But anyway, Loki.

485
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:57,840
I was just working on Minecraft stuff this week, mostly just finishing up a build and editing, still working on editing, hoping to have my new episode out here soon.

486
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:09,640
The problem is every time I introduce a robot master in in the series, I have to hand animate the stage like intro thing that they do in like Mega Man 2 and it takes time.

487
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:14,120
It's annoying, but I have to do it because perfection.

488
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:18,800
So hopefully we'll have a new episode out, hopefully by tomorrow.

489
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:20,360
Awesome.

490
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:21,080
That's about it.

491
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:21,480
Yeah.

492
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:22,200
Good luck.

493
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,080
Never did.

494
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:26,520
Is it still no word on the Minecraft contest from a couple weeks ago?

495
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:27,240
All right.

496
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,080
I'm trying.

497
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:28,400
I'm trying.

498
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:28,840
I'm thinking.

499
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:29,400
I'm thinking about it.

500
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:29,760
All right.

501
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:31,640
My gaming week.

502
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:36,800
Actually, before I get to my gaming week, let me talk about something else real quick, because it has to do with what I just disappeared about.

503
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:40,760
So, you know, and a lot of you know about, huh?

504
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,440
I hope everything's okay.

505
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,120
It's actually not about me.

506
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:44,680
It's about Mr.

507
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:45,160
Smoosh.

508
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:48,320
And I think maybe you've caught about some of this from social media and stuff.

509
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,960
Oh, maybe no, because I don't really post on Twitter as much as I used to.

510
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,200
So here's the thing.

511
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:52,840
Here's what's going on.

512
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:53,400
So Mr.

513
00:32:53,400 --> 00:33:03,920
Smoosh gave us a little bit of a scare on Wednesday, and we ended up spending like seven hours at the emergency vet because he was very lethargic, not wanting to move.

514
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:08,680
We could tell he wasn't really wanting to move his back legs like something was kind of going on there.

515
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:14,480
And so we thought he may have had a seizure or something like may have happened.

516
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:23,080
So we took him in and they ruled out that he can still use his back legs because they were warm.

517
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:23,840
They weren't cold.

518
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:34,720
And we ended up going to the ER vet and we spent a lot of money, but well, we didn't spend two because we could have gotten an MRI for $7,000, but I have to draw the line somewhere.

519
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:48,520
So they did some x-rays and we kind of found out the next day that the x-rays were showing that he probably has a calcified disc in his back, which doesn't happen in cats as often as it doesn't dogs.

520
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:51,280
That's usually a thing for dogs, but they say it can happen in cats.

521
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:52,040
You know, Mr.

522
00:33:52,040 --> 00:34:01,760
Smoosh is a special cat, but it kind of explains like, oh, this is why when we found him, he was on the stairs, but at the halfway point.

523
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:07,760
And like he didn't want to continue the journey up or down the stairs, whichever way he was going, he was kind of hiding behind the scratching post there.

524
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:14,200
So we've kind of noticed since then, now that we're starting to get some answers, we've kind of noticed that he does have an aversion to stairs.

525
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:18,000
He'll use them if he's motivated by food.

526
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,480
He'll still try to go down, even though he shouldn't be.

527
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:23,920
So we have a baby gate on the way from Amazon to try to stave that off.

528
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:31,040
But he'll try to use the stairs still if he's food motivated, but otherwise he's kind of not using it.

529
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:34,160
So we moved all there for those that know the layout of my house.

530
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:35,960
We moved all the cat food upstairs.

531
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:38,160
So the cats have everything they need upstairs.

532
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:42,920
He shouldn't have a need to go downstairs, but he just kind of does it for whatever.

533
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,600
You can't tell a cat no, right?

534
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:45,680
Like or stop that.

535
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:46,520
You'll hurt yourself.

536
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:54,280
So, yeah, at the end of the day, you know, the reality is he's an extremely inbred cat.

537
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:57,200
He was a rescue and he was a very special kind of rescue.

538
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,560
He has cool David Bowie eyes, too.

539
00:34:58,880 --> 00:34:59,480
He does.

540
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:06,080
That's why the thought was originally it could have been neurological because the eyes are a sign that he's always had something kind of up neurologically.

541
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:10,480
But the X-ray kind of makes us think and especially his behaviors.

542
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,560
It's like, oh, he has an aversion to stairs.

543
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:15,400
OK, yeah, he doesn't really want to use his back or whatever.

544
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,920
But the reality is he's he's old.

545
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:22,040
He's like a 10 year old cat at this point, which for his breed is getting pretty old.

546
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,480
So, you know, it was scary.

547
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,720
We thought that.

548
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:31,120
Yeah, you got smooshy kind of around the time I got Midna.

549
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:32,680
Well, it was the same year my mom passed.

550
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:33,600
It was twenty seventeen.

551
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:36,560
So and he was already three or four base.

552
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,040
And that's based on the vet's estimate.

553
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,080
For all we know, it could be older.

554
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:43,280
Yeah, it wasn't too long after I'd gotten Midna and it was just a few years.

555
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:46,560
So it is turning 11 on my birthday next month.

556
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,240
Yeah, so yeah.

557
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:51,120
So anyway, not to not to bring and thank you.

558
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:53,960
I see you all in chat sending the love and thank you.

559
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:56,080
It's it's received and thank you very much for that.

560
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:58,360
And I just know, you know, you all know the cat, Mr.

561
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:58,920
Smoosh and all that.

562
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,760
But that's just something we've been kind of dealing with.

563
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:05,200
And that's why I just went off screen here, because I can see from where I'm at.

564
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:09,280
I have a view of the staircase and I could see him kind of going meow meow and kind of pacing around.

565
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,280
I thought, oh, is he wanting to go downstairs?

566
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:14,360
But Alan thinks he's just hungry because it's about that time.

567
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:19,960
So he's he's just out there complaining about food to anyone that I've had a hard time.

568
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:20,920
Give me extra food.

569
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:23,760
Yeah, pretty much. But he's getting spoiled now.

570
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:29,240
Not only did his dad spend again, I a lot of money on that.

571
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:32,200
I we have a he had expenses.

572
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:37,440
Yeah. And I'm sure I'm sure many folks out there know, you know, it's just one of those things that it's never.

573
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:40,920
And, you know, you're you're you're a captive in that moment.

574
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:45,000
You will do whatever it takes to help your little furry friends.

575
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,280
So it's it's rough.

576
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:51,080
I've already decided that with my next cat, I'm getting insurance.

577
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,320
Yeah. Yeah.

578
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,440
It's probably something I can't I can't afford to get Midna's teeth fixed.

579
00:36:56,600 --> 00:37:01,760
Yeah. So I just have to brush her teeth and give her antibiotic,

580
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:04,840
you know, stuff for her water and hope for the best.

581
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:09,880
So and it was interesting watching Cheddar kind of respond to the whole thing, too,

582
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:12,520
because he was kind of like, what the hell's going on?

583
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:16,480
And then he was he was really staying away from all of us when we got back.

584
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:19,520
He would not. And we were like, what's and they were like, oh, because we smell like the vet

585
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:22,200
and all those other animals that were there.

586
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:25,040
So it took him it took him about a day for him to warm back up to us.

587
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,880
So this is very interesting.

588
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:31,520
Anyway, sorry not to divert too much, but that's what's going on.

589
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:36,320
So I think now that I think about it, Alan wrote a couple of tweets,

590
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:39,160
but I understand a tweet can get lost amongst all the other stuff.

591
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:43,160
And yeah, it's just hard to update everybody work the last four days.

592
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:46,640
So it's hard for me to to check, except in this little crazy burst.

593
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:49,160
For sure. For sure. Yeah.

594
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:55,480
Anyways, I just going to say Midna has been extra all upon, but.

595
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:59,360
Yeah, she just has allergies. Yeah. Yeah.

596
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:04,440
So when I did play games this week, when I wasn't too taken over by that,

597
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:08,280
I've played a little bit of the Diablo four beta this weekend, although granted,

598
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:13,440
not nearly as much as I was playing last weekend because I finally got that point.

599
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:17,560
As much as I love Diablo four, I've kind of got to that point where I'm like, OK,

600
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,760
well, they're going to erase these characters anyway.

601
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:23,000
I've hit twenty five, which is the max level in the beta.

602
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:27,200
And not not only will I have my pet dog thing that you get at twenty,

603
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:32,000
but I can I entered myself into the contest to get painted into the chapel in France,

604
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:37,240
whatever they're doing, if you actually get to twenty five, because that'll be fun.

605
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:39,800
Can you imagine my face in a chapel somewhere?

606
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:44,480
I hope I win. I've never wanted to win a contest more in my life.

607
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,160
So I did everything I could do with that.

608
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:49,440
And so I'm kind of at the point where I'm like, OK, well,

609
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,000
I screwed around with some of the new classes.

610
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,840
But the reality is, let's just wait for the game to come out at this point.

611
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,320
I'm happy to stress test.

612
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:57,440
So I did that a little bit this weekend. I played.

613
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:01,520
I sat in the queue for a little bit, but I didn't I didn't need to hit the pavement

614
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:05,800
as hard as I was doing last week and ensuring that I hit the the max level I could.

615
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,680
But I'm still loving Diablo four.

616
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:10,280
Absolutely. I'm buying it when it comes out.

617
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:14,760
Can't wait. Other games I've been playing a little bit of theater,

618
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:15,680
but not a lot.

619
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,560
I think I did stream that a little bit this week

620
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:21,080
because I finished No Man's Sky Expedition nine on Monday.

621
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:23,360
It only took me about another forty five minutes on stream

622
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:25,120
and I finished the expedition and got the rewards.

623
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,720
So, yeah, that was an accomplishment.

624
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:29,000
I beat something that was an accomplishment.

625
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,920
And then I played more theater than which I still have not played

626
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,720
every song one time yet.

627
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:36,760
There's still like at least probably 50 more songs going to make my way through.

628
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:39,160
But there's just so many songs in that game.

629
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:43,480
So honestly, between all those things, that's pretty much my gaming week.

630
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:46,880
So we'll move on.

631
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,200
Let's get into some other headlines.

632
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:53,120
I was trying to think if there's any like housekeeping or programming notes,

633
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,400
but not really.

634
00:39:54,400 --> 00:40:00,640
We don't have any plan trips or anything that'll get take the show away coming up.

635
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:03,280
So we'll be here for the next few weeks,

636
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,840
as long as we have power and all that good stuff.

637
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:08,240
All right, Loki, let's get into some news.

638
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,960
Yes, this is a very exciting out of nowhere.

639
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:16,400
There is the announcement that Valve is putting out Counter-Strike 2,

640
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:19,720
which is going to be a free update for Counter-Strike Go,

641
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:22,440
which will completely redo the whole game.

642
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:27,480
So they had some trailers that they put out kind of talk about

643
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:31,440
the different game mechanics that they're adding to it.

644
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:35,960
So, for example, they have volumetric smoke grenades now, which look really cool.

645
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:38,320
They kind of react to

646
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:41,520
bullet shots and also other explosions nearby.

647
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:44,840
They're going to have something that's like a sub tick.

648
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:47,320
So it basically allows for more accurate

649
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:51,120
positioning of players and bullets and that type of stuff.

650
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:56,160
They're overhauling the maps as well as keeping some of the older maps as well.

651
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:59,560
Kind of like the kind of doing it in three different phases.

652
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:03,600
So they have the older maps that they're kind of giving new

653
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,800
like lighting effects to and that type of stuff.

654
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:08,000
But essentially, there could be exactly the same.

655
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:10,120
Then there's

656
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:14,520
some updated maps that they're adding, you know, like more features to

657
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:18,280
that kind of utilize more of Counter-Strike 2

658
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:20,760
and then like some fully redone maps.

659
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:24,240
Higher resolution models for the guns.

660
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:27,000
New Source 2 tools for modders.

661
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,840
New blood splatters.

662
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:35,720
And see, they said completely re-authored explosions and more accurate audio.

663
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,760
It looks pretty sweet.

664
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:40,080
Bigger and badder explosions.

665
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:44,000
Exactly. The smoke, the smoke looks cool, too.

666
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,120
Like, I think that's kind of the fun stuff.

667
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:49,880
They're saying that all existing Counter-Strike Go skins will transfer

668
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:54,920
to Counter-Strike 2 and they'll be also more visually detailed.

669
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:56,240
So that's kind of cool.

670
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:58,120
You know, they get all that stuff to go along with it.

671
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:01,280
Yeah. Excited to see what else they do with that.

672
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:04,800
Talk about, you know, last week how gamers are eating good.

673
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:07,960
Well, it's putting more food out.

674
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,040
Well, you know, with Counter-Strike, this kind of upgrade,

675
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:15,600
this is a little bit like, you know, Counter-Strike to Counter-Strike 2

676
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,600
or I guess really Counter-Strike Go to Counter-Strike 2

677
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:20,880
is kind of like Overwatch to Overwatch 2, right?

678
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:23,760
Like this is meant to replace the base game, right?

679
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:24,760
Well, except more.

680
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:27,760
Like they didn't really do as much into Overwatch 2

681
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:30,400
comparisonally, but it is meant to be a replacement.

682
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,720
Overwatch 2 is essentially Overwatch 1.

683
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:35,120
But yeah, yeah, basically it is an overhaul to the original game.

684
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:37,120
OK. And it's meant to replace it.

685
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:40,000
And it is it's it's I think I heard it's going to be free to those

686
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,480
that already have Counter-Strike, basically, which I mean,

687
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:46,240
how many people haven't picked up Counter-Strike in some kind of bundle

688
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:49,680
over the years or some kind of sale on Valve?

689
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:51,760
Like that game's been out a long time.

690
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:53,960
You probably have it in your library and you don't even know it.

691
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:56,320
You know, like it's you got it somewhere.

692
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:57,760
So that's interesting.

693
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,960
That'll be coming out, you know, the sequel.

694
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:05,000
It's also nice that Valve is finally putting out a game that isn't VR

695
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:08,280
for for the rest of us that, you know, aren't quite on board

696
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:10,280
with the VR stuff still.

697
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:11,520
And it's it's nice.

698
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:15,240
Granted, I haven't played Counter-Strike since the original Xbox.

699
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:18,440
I'm not even talking about the original Xbox last time I played Counter-Strike.

700
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:21,720
But still, it is nice that they still avoided using three.

701
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:24,560
Technically, since this is like the third Counter-Strike game,

702
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:25,880
but it is Counter-Strike 2.

703
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:29,760
So still no threes in Valve's life.

704
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:33,120
They don't have to break their habit there.

705
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:36,080
Yeah. Let's see.

706
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:40,440
E3VL does point out at least they didn't go the free to play model like Overwatch.

707
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:42,440
So that is that is also it.

708
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:47,360
Well, do we do we know of any types of microtransactions,

709
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:50,040
battle passes, things they might be looking to add

710
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:53,000
since they are essentially giving this away for free?

711
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,360
Well, I don't think it's anything different than what they have now.

712
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:56,640
Was it the gun skins?

713
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:58,040
Don't they have all that stuff?

714
00:43:58,040 --> 00:43:59,560
Like, isn't that a whole thing?

715
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:03,120
Don't they have crates and stuff?

716
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:04,560
Yeah, I guess that's true.

717
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:07,120
Gambling stuff. True, true.

718
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:08,800
I assume that's still a thing.

719
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:12,560
And Chad is debating if this is actually fourth or fifth Counter-Strike.

720
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:17,040
Mike Def says OG Counter-Strike, Source, Go, and now two.

721
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:20,800
E3VL is counting one called Condition Zero as well.

722
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:23,640
So there's been a few Counter-Strike games.

723
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:25,360
None of them number three, though.

724
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:26,720
No, none of them three. No.

725
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:33,480
All right. Moving on, let's talk about this, which, by the way,

726
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:36,040
also kind of plays into the whole like reminders

727
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:37,600
that we're going to be talking about Nintendo.

728
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:40,360
I think we have an email on it later, so I won't go too far in depth.

729
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:43,440
But, you know, we talked about it already last week, really.

730
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:47,520
But the Nintendo eShop is basically going to be closing

731
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:50,520
at some point very soon tomorrow.

732
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:52,520
But we don't know when. Is that 1201?

733
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,760
Is that 1159?

734
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:55,960
We don't know when tomorrow.

735
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:58,600
But, you know, we're in the last dawn of the final day,

736
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:01,160
basically, of the Wii U and 3DS eShops.

737
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:04,840
So I know we have an email on it later.

738
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:05,800
I'll wait till we get to that.

739
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:09,960
But, you know, it has a lot of us kind of either making those last few purchases or.

740
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:13,560
For me, I'm kind of like,

741
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:16,000
why would I reward Nintendo for this right now?

742
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:16,560
I'm not going to.

743
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:19,120
But I don't want to tell people what they should and shouldn't do.

744
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:21,160
I understand why people want to do their last minute shopping,

745
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:22,560
get those things where they go away.

746
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:25,040
I'm kind of like, I don't want to reward Nintendo for this decision.

747
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:27,120
Like I bought what I bought and that's it.

748
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:32,960
But here's a concept I do want to reward because I think this sounds great.

749
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:37,360
And this is a retro game project coming out for the Switch.

750
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:39,760
It's called Project Egg.

751
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:42,440
This is still a tentative title.

752
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:44,680
It is from D4 Enterprise,

753
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:47,760
and it's something that they're going to be using to release titles

754
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:50,720
from their retro games distribution service for the Switch.

755
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:54,320
And these are going to be games for platforms like MSX,

756
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:57,760
PC-9801, PC-8801.

757
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:03,040
This is also a platform that's going to be used Pico Pico for smartphones.

758
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:08,240
And they say virtual console for Wii U, Wii and 3DS, but I don't.

759
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:13,320
I think this is because I think they're talking about that

760
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:16,720
they have released games prior on these systems.

761
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,680
So if you want to go back and look at those systems,

762
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:20,120
kind of see like what is that?

763
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:23,120
Sorry, that's just a very oddly worded phrase there.

764
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:26,240
But if you want to see the types of games they have released,

765
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:28,480
they're in those archives.

766
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:34,040
Egg, if you are curious, stands for engrossing game gallery,

767
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:37,200
which of course is leading to all of those memes of

768
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:40,000
can I offer you an egg in these trying times?

769
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:43,120
Some of the games I recognize just from the screenshots,

770
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:45,160
I notice Hyde Lied in there.

771
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:49,920
So yeah, this sounds like it's the what I like about it is

772
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:51,960
these are I hope this comes out for the US.

773
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:54,160
It does look very Japanese based.

774
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:55,880
But of course, the Switch is reason free.

775
00:46:56,840 --> 00:47:00,200
I hope that there's some really good stuff in there.

776
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:03,240
Like I like the obscure type of stuff.

777
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:04,880
Oh, one of the Cotton Games is in here.

778
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:06,480
I see in the screenshot, actually.

779
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:08,400
I know Jamie loves that series.

780
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:11,160
Revival Xanadu is also called out by name there.

781
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:15,240
So there's just a lot of like obscure but cool titles in here.

782
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:18,240
And that's exactly the types of stuff we should be celebrating

783
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:19,840
in these retro catalogs.

784
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:21,400
So I think this is neat.

785
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:24,840
So props to D4 for working on this and making it happen.

786
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:28,120
So there was a thing it said in there, too, like

787
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:31,800
I noticed like when I translated the what,

788
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:35,840
you know, talking about Project A, it says general creators.

789
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:36,880
It was built.

790
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:40,320
People will be able to sell software created for retro consoles.

791
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:44,720
I guess homebrew software like their PC 8801, PC 9801,

792
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:49,160
X68000, FM7, X1, MSX, et cetera.

793
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:50,760
Holy moly.

794
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:53,800
So looking at this list over on because

795
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:59,480
I guess on Wiki there's actually a big old list there in the D4 Enterprise article.

796
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:02,520
I did not realize it was this large of a library.

797
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:03,360
Oops, sorry, folks.

798
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:08,040
I just accidentally placed this over the webcam capture.

799
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:09,240
But look at this.

800
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:12,400
Like there are one thousand eighty four games on this list.

801
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:15,200
I have no idea how to even organize a list like this,

802
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:19,000
but it does have things for the arcade, including Double Dragon is in there.

803
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:21,880
A lot of Famicom based games.

804
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:23,680
Yeah, Karnov.

805
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:26,000
So you get an idea of the types of like developers

806
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,320
that they're working with and so forth.

807
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:30,800
So this is going to be a very beefy collection

808
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:32,160
whenever it comes out for Switch.

809
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:33,680
So that's really cool.

810
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:35,200
So oops.

811
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:37,400
Not that sorry.

812
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:41,760
Having to produce, do camera angles and all that on the fly is hard sometimes.

813
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:44,680
So sorry for the awkwardness on twitch shots sometimes.

814
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:46,360
All right.

815
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:48,240
Dark to see also points out

816
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:51,480
if you want to see a YouTube channel that has short video clips of these games

817
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:54,120
that is also available with Project Egg.

818
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:55,480
All right.

819
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:59,240
Let's move on to some not so great news.

820
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:02,800
But unfortunately, one we're hearing a lot in this industry lately, Dark Sakura.

821
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:06,360
Well, and it's full of a lot of just like.

822
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:10,800
Excuse talk to me.

823
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:12,480
But at any rate.

824
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:15,360
More than 400 Twitch employees

825
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:18,200
got laid off because of what Amazon's going through.

826
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:22,240
Amazon announced another 9000 job cuts,

827
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:26,000
adding to the 18000 layoffs from January.

828
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:30,360
And then about 400 employees from Twitch

829
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:34,120
are affected in that that whole business.

830
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:40,600
Twitch didn't give the impacted employees

831
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:43,720
any sort of advance notice ahead of the announcement on the 20th.

832
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,080
The CEO just basically sent out an all staff email

833
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:52,840
that people affected would be informed no later than early next week.

834
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:57,520
And it's just, again, just a bunch of.

835
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:00,640
Excuse talk.

836
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:05,120
The CEO, Clancy, is blaming the layoffs on, quote,

837
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:09,680
current macro economic environment and user and revenue growth

838
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:12,600
that has not kept pace with our expectations, end quote.

839
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:15,320
In other words, I'm going to throw out a bunch of jargon on there

840
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:17,520
and hope that it sounds important enough for you to believe it.

841
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:21,320
In a nutshell,

842
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:23,240
they're not making the money we thought they did.

843
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:26,320
So now we fucked up and now we have to fuck up these people's lives.

844
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:28,680
Well, and who who misforecast that?

845
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:31,600
I mean, I understand Twitch grew a lot during the pandemic.

846
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:34,840
And so there's a little bit of like the tide receding a little bit as,

847
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:37,440
you know, things, pandemic lockdowns

848
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:39,840
practically ended pretty much across the globe at this point.

849
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:42,480
That a lot of that is receding a little bit.

850
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:45,440
But you would think that somebody could have seen that coming.

851
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:47,960
It's weird. But at least there's this.

852
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:49,960
This is this is interesting to me when I heard this.

853
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:51,200
This is the interesting news.

854
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:55,160
Emmett Shearer, the former CEO, just left last week.

855
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:59,600
So I can't sit here and be like, well, why does nothing ever happen to the CEO?

856
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:05,440
Well, OK. I mean, now, do we think that the CEO left because they,

857
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:08,160
you know, did Emmett Shearer leave because this news was coming?

858
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:10,160
I mean, in a variety of ways, probably yes.

859
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:12,960
He probably left when he did. So he didn't have to do this.

860
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:15,320
It's probably one of those things that was brought down.

861
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:17,280
And so he kind of ran off into the night.

862
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:18,880
But at least I can't sit here and go,

863
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:21,720
why isn't the guy who's been CEO for the last few years been held accountable?

864
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:25,120
He did bow out. I will get I will give him that credit.

865
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:32,240
That that there's lots of CEOs in this industry who don't do that.

866
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:34,840
So I'll give him that for what it's worth.

867
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:39,840
But it is, yeah, it's garbage and it's.

868
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:44,200
Instead of investing in their employees

869
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:49,480
and pushing the company to do better or are finding other ways to

870
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:54,960
use that talent pool, they're just saying, oh, no, we just don't want to pay you. Bye.

871
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:57,520
I hate it.

872
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:02,240
Maybe if there was more synergy with the rest of Amazon going on,

873
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:04,080
because that's the other thing that blows my mind about Twitch

874
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:08,440
sometimes is that like I feel like they live in a bubble with that so much.

875
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:10,720
I know I've talked about this on the show and I'm sorry to repeat myself,

876
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:14,760
but that so much of Amazon feels so siloed and that that I'm

877
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:19,960
quite frankly shocked that Luna isn't more integrated into Twitch.

878
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:22,360
Not that I'm saying I want that. I'm just shocked.

879
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:26,120
They haven't taken more of an opportunity to do that. It's wild to me.

880
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:29,880
Yeah, they they are really.

881
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:34,160
They're just fucking the whole thing up.

882
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:38,560
I mean, they acquire a platform that they don't truly understand,

883
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:42,320
you know, to service people who do things that I think they don't truly understand.

884
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:46,560
And then I just don't think that they know what they're doing.

885
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:47,760
I mean, be honest.

886
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:52,480
It should it should be this easy as like if Dark Sakura is going, hey,

887
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:55,560
we need one more for our Swift and Dead by Daylight

888
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:58,200
because somebody could make it tonight. Let's do one more for Swift.

889
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:02,520
You should be able to click a button and fire up Dead by Daylight on Luna

890
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:04,680
and be able to join her Swift right away.

891
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:06,480
By the way, that was a thing in Stadia.

892
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:08,760
But it's not there on it's not on.

893
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:10,000
Oh, Dead by Daylight is not on Luna?

894
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,640
OK, bad example. I just assume they put that game everywhere. My bad.

895
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:16,280
OK, but but that example, that example,

896
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:19,840
but a game that is on Luna still should should hold some water here.

897
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:22,680
So I mean, it doesn't really matter the streaming service.

898
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:25,080
If there's a streaming service that's owned by a company

899
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:29,280
that also has live streaming service, you know, like a game

900
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:32,680
streaming service with a company that owns their own streaming service.

901
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:37,040
Like how the Google integration when Stadia was around,

902
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:41,600
you pressed a button and it would link up to a live play on your YouTube channel.

903
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:45,760
Yeah. Yeah, it's it's ridiculous.

904
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:50,160
I mean, Stadia did it right and they got fucked over

905
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:54,440
because Google's got this other weird announcement now

906
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:56,960
about another company that they're working with for cloud based gaming.

907
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:58,200
And I'm just like, I hate you.

908
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:00,280
I officially hate you right now.

909
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:02,360
Don't don't talk to me. Don't speak.

910
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:04,720
I don't hear. Yeah, exactly.

911
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:07,600
Exactly. Talk to the hand because the wallet doesn't want it.

912
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:11,160
Exactly. But but like.

913
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:19,320
I'm just. Maybe it's that I don't have that corporate mindset.

914
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:22,520
I mean, I don't want to be a manager and I don't want to be corporate, you know,

915
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:27,400
but at the same time, you know, I work for a company

916
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:32,600
that is all about utilizing its talent pool instead of laying people off.

917
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:36,280
You know, we have positions open in our company

918
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:39,320
and they're hiring from other groups in the same company

919
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:42,720
to cover those things instead of laying people off.

920
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:44,960
And I can't say where I work.

921
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:46,800
Some of you all know, don't say anything.

922
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:54,400
But I think that that Amazon and a lot of these gaming companies

923
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:57,480
that are laying off all these people need to actually really take a look

924
00:54:57,480 --> 00:55:00,600
at their business model and see why they're getting themselves

925
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:02,920
into this puddle to begin with.

926
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:07,760
You know, you can't keep doing things the same way

927
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:12,000
they've always been done and get yourself into this pattern of fuckery.

928
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:15,880
You know, the the quote is the definition of madness

929
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:18,520
is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results.

930
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,360
That's exactly what you're doing.

931
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:23,960
You're hamsters in a wheel and the wheel keeps spinning and spinning.

932
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:26,640
You need to do something different.

933
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:29,120
You need to take a risk and do something fucking different.

934
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:31,800
I want to get the comments from chat.

935
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:33,040
There's a lot of good stuff in chat right now.

936
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:36,160
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says there's also political infighting

937
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:37,400
inside these large companies.

938
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:39,520
Different divisions don't necessarily like each other

939
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:41,480
and will not work to help everyone else.

940
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:44,720
So the Luna and Twitch teams might not be on good terms with each other

941
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:46,920
and are actively avoiding having to work together.

942
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:48,400
Oh, my God.

943
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:51,760
Then that if that if that I mean, I know that's hypothesizing,

944
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:55,600
but if that was a thing, then that falls on Jeff Bezos

945
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:59,960
to walk in there and say, you fucking make it work, period.

946
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:03,080
And the head of Luna and the head of Twitch,

947
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:06,520
your asses are on the line to make this work like it.

948
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:08,480
This is wild.

949
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:12,200
I mean, I'm not disputing what you're saying, Bobby,

950
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:14,480
but it's it's it's wild to me

951
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:17,280
that that can happen in a profitable company.

952
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:19,400
If your job.

953
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:22,000
I'm sorry, I forgot Jeff Bezos was retired, but you know, you know what I mean.

954
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:26,240
If your job is to do

955
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:30,040
what is necessary as dictated by your upper management

956
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:33,640
to make something work, it does not matter

957
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:35,920
how you feel about working with another department.

958
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,280
End of story.

959
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:40,600
Your assignment is to work together.

960
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:44,160
So if they're not working together, this is coming from higher up than they are.

961
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:49,440
Fixation Gaze says it feels like Amazon is using Twitch

962
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:52,600
as a passive income and get upset when record profits

963
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:55,160
manipulating a sick market aren't beaten.

964
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:57,680
Absolutely. Absolutely.

965
00:56:57,680 --> 00:57:01,880
This is just supposed to be Amazon's little money printing thing,

966
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:04,280
and they're not thinking about how they can better integrate it

967
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:07,800
into the rest of their business and make it more profitable from that standpoint.

968
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:09,240
It's very silly.

969
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:14,880
Phil of nine says, I always wonder about how huge these tech companies got.

970
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:17,440
It always seemed like they ballooned so quickly.

971
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:21,720
2003 called and says

972
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:25,040
history repeats itself.

973
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:30,600
But yes, I mean, but that's exactly what I was saying about that pattern

974
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:33,480
that no one seems to learn from, you know?

975
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:37,480
And honestly, you know, what took down the Roman Empire,

976
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:40,000
the fucking Roman Empire?

977
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:41,400
That's going to happen again.

978
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:44,520
The companies are going to get too big, too big, too big and explode.

979
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:48,600
WN record or is it WN record?

980
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:51,240
Because English is a silly language, but I'm going to guess record.

981
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:53,240
WN record says it's nutty.

982
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:56,960
How many companies are doing record business and still laying off?

983
00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:59,480
Well, that's CEO salaries.

984
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,720
It has to do a lot with their projections

985
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:06,520
and, you know, taking into account things like inflation,

986
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:08,760
operating costs, ongoing projects.

987
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:12,560
You can bring in a current higher profit

988
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:15,080
that if it's not going to accommodate your projection.

989
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:21,240
Or your expected operating costs in the next quarter or next year.

990
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:25,520
Then. It actually makes perfect sense

991
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:28,320
why they would try to take preventative measures

992
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:32,080
to preserve their income rate.

993
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:36,400
But you're also right, it does go back to the CEOs and and whatnot.

994
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:39,840
Maximum wage laws.

995
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:42,800
I also agree with Fixie that, quote,

996
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:45,720
these kinds of layoffs during a global recession should be negligence.

997
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:50,200
Absolutely. And I mean, you want to look at like what a good example is.

998
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:53,600
Look at what Iwata did.

999
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:58,240
Yes. When Nintendo took their big dip, it's the pay cut.

1000
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:01,880
And you know what? I think that should be the rule for a CEO.

1001
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:05,200
You know, if you're if your company is fucking up

1002
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:10,320
and you are the leader of said company, you take the hit, not your employees.

1003
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:14,000
People only think about themselves.

1004
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:18,560
Greed begets, you know, wealth begets greed is what I think.

1005
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:21,160
The more you have, the more you want.

1006
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:23,560
And you think someone's going to try to take it out of your hand.

1007
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:24,680
But guess what?

1008
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:28,360
You don't need as much money as you're making to live.

1009
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:31,840
You don't. And that is OK.

1010
00:59:32,680 --> 00:59:37,480
The money that these people make, they can put it into a money market

1011
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:41,160
or a CD or something and live very comfortably

1012
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:43,920
and very extravagantly off of the interest.

1013
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:46,040
And that's the problem that we're having right there.

1014
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:47,840
All these fuckers need to get taxed.

1015
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:48,880
But that's another story.

1016
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:53,160
But that is why the gamers really respected Iwata and miss him greatly.

1017
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:55,400
He was one of the greats.

1018
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:58,440
So his memory be a blessing.

1019
00:59:58,440 --> 00:59:59,680
In other Twitch news,

1020
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:03,080
we actually kind of have a companion article to this of some sort, Loki.

1021
01:00:03,960 --> 01:00:09,200
Yeah. So, of course, you know, Twitch is saying that right now

1022
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:14,680
it's the best place for creators to stream and make money, apparently.

1023
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:18,680
I mean, sure, yeah, they're going to say that.

1024
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:21,160
I mean, why wouldn't they say that? They're always going to say that.

1025
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:26,000
But apparently talking with the Verge,

1026
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:29,360
you know, Tom Varelli said that

1027
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:33,160
I don't think there's ever been a better time to start streaming on Twitch.

1028
01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:36,000
We've talked a lot about how we're going.

1029
01:00:36,040 --> 01:00:38,360
We're in this together and we're part of this innovation.

1030
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:42,120
We're we're committed to continuing to improve our monetization products

1031
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:44,840
and building new monetization products.

1032
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:45,760
At the end of the day,

1033
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:48,440
we are committed to increasing the amount of money streamers can earn.

1034
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:54,680
Oh, you know, I mean, because like you just like reduced your split of,

1035
01:00:55,080 --> 01:01:01,080
you know, revenue from 70 30 down to like, you know, 50 50 for everybody.

1036
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:07,640
And then on top of that, like you have these new apparently

1037
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:13,160
ad incentive programs that you provide to certain affiliates.

1038
01:01:13,160 --> 01:01:17,120
I guess that if you run a certain number of ads in an hour,

1039
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:21,400
a ridiculous number of ads, then they'll pay you like extra money.

1040
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:24,120
But it's not even really that much money on top of it.

1041
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:28,040
Um, not to mention that if you're running that many ads,

1042
01:01:28,040 --> 01:01:30,280
you're probably going to lose engagement anyways.

1043
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:32,040
One of the other things, too, on top of that

1044
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:34,920
is that their ads program that they have right now,

1045
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:38,160
if you run less than three minutes of ads in an hour,

1046
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:41,840
you're actually only making 30 percent of the revenue from that, not even the 50.

1047
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:46,000
You have to run, I think, over three minutes of ads per hour

1048
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:50,320
to get that full 50 to 55 amount from them.

1049
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:53,200
I didn't even know they changed that.

1050
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:55,800
So it's it's it's been like that for a while.

1051
01:01:56,600 --> 01:01:59,000
Yeah. So it's just it's not really.

1052
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:02,880
I think they're going to have to try a lot harder ovens, you know?

1053
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:04,320
I mean, yeah.

1054
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:08,320
I mean, no company's going to come and go, yeah, we're just like terrible.

1055
01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:10,600
Like maybe you shouldn't use our service.

1056
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:12,360
Like, of course, they're going to say

1057
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:15,440
you're the best place because they're going to do that.

1058
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,920
Um, I mean, what other choices you have, you have YouTube

1059
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:22,440
and then there's the other startup that just kick.

1060
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:25,640
Yeah, you're thinking of.

1061
01:02:25,640 --> 01:02:26,480
Yeah, I think so.

1062
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:30,080
I'm I'm laughing because I just went on there this weekend just to claim my name,

1063
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:32,320
you know, just just in case, because you never know.

1064
01:02:32,560 --> 01:02:34,000
But I was just kind of poking around.

1065
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:40,000
And it definitely like it just feels like a we want to be Twitch type of plan.

1066
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:43,200
Like I'm looking at the content that's being featured and I'm just like,

1067
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:45,120
none of this looks like something I'd enjoy.

1068
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:48,480
Sorry, I'm just telling it like it is like it's just I it just

1069
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:52,240
I wasn't seeing a lot of like compelling content

1070
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:54,360
from what I was seeing there on the screen.

1071
01:02:54,360 --> 01:03:00,240
It looks like a lot of people who just want to be the next megabucks streamer

1072
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:03,600
and playing those types of games or gambling simulators or whatever it is.

1073
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:07,160
Like I just I was I looked at the website and I was bored.

1074
01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:10,680
That was that was my quick review of kick.

1075
01:03:10,680 --> 01:03:11,800
Sorry, but that's what I mean.

1076
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:13,840
And you know what? It's still young.

1077
01:03:13,840 --> 01:03:14,800
It's in its infancy.

1078
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:16,920
May it grow into something bigger? Possibly.

1079
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:19,080
Could I be eating crow later on? Who knows?

1080
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:22,240
I'm just saying how I feel today and what what I saw in that site

1081
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:25,680
when I went today, but we'll see. So, yeah.

1082
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:33,880
I but it does seem like Twitch runs mainly unopposed.

1083
01:03:33,880 --> 01:03:36,000
So I mean, I guess there's YouTube.

1084
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:37,800
I guess you could count kick,

1085
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:39,960
but I don't think you can until they have a mobile app,

1086
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:41,880
which apparently is coming very soon.

1087
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:45,160
But, you know, until that day, none of these compared like

1088
01:03:45,160 --> 01:03:48,840
and there's been every year there's some new up and comer

1089
01:03:48,840 --> 01:03:50,520
that wants to take on Twitch.

1090
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:53,880
Unless you have a mobile app and you have some more integration

1091
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:58,720
on other devices than just PC screens, you can't be taken seriously. Period.

1092
01:03:59,160 --> 01:04:03,720
So anybody that wants to take on somebody has to be able to at least

1093
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:05,760
bare minimum have a mobile app.

1094
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:11,320
To do that. Exactly, especially in this age. Seriously.

1095
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:15,960
An interesting perspective from Fixation Gaze here in chat,

1096
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:20,080
who says, just to add something to the best place for creators.

1097
01:04:20,080 --> 01:04:22,120
A year ago, I had my own experiment.

1098
01:04:22,520 --> 01:04:25,760
When I included the autistic tag on my screen streams,

1099
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:30,160
I was less likely to end up recommended by about 75%.

1100
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:34,120
It's only the best for certain creators who start the game famous.

1101
01:04:34,320 --> 01:04:37,720
Plus, most creators rely on subs to survive over ads.

1102
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:41,440
Oh, definitely. Ads, ads make literal pennies.

1103
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:44,920
I'm not, you know, even though I'm like, oh, they changed it like years ago

1104
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:47,840
and I wasn't paying attention. I'm like, it doesn't matter. It's pennies.

1105
01:04:47,840 --> 01:04:51,200
If I don't have thousands of viewers, it's not going to matter.

1106
01:04:51,560 --> 01:04:56,320
But, um, uh, but that's, that's very interesting about the tags,

1107
01:04:56,320 --> 01:05:00,560
because something I do notice Twitch added just in the past couple of months

1108
01:05:01,120 --> 01:05:03,560
was that you can see how your tags perform.

1109
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:06,640
And I am a little bit surprised, well, I'm not totally surprised,

1110
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:10,880
but a little surprised at which ones perform a lot stronger than others.

1111
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:13,840
And I think that was interesting.

1112
01:05:13,840 --> 01:05:16,400
I don't know how to see how you're getting recommended, though.

1113
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:18,920
That's, that's interesting. So.

1114
01:05:21,040 --> 01:05:23,880
All right. Well, let's move on. We have more news to cover.

1115
01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:28,960
So let's talk about some news from Atari and a game

1116
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:32,840
that I remember Dark Soccer talking about on this show not a terribly long time ago

1117
01:05:32,840 --> 01:05:36,000
in her Classic Game of the Week segment, and that was the game System Shock.

1118
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:40,000
Because System Shock has a remake that they've been working on for a while,

1119
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,240
and we still don't know exactly when it's coming out.

1120
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:46,160
But the publisher, Prime Matter,

1121
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:50,520
apparently is actually going to be getting picked up

1122
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,560
by Atari, although this,

1123
01:05:54,680 --> 01:05:59,480
the story I linked here has to do with that we do have a date of May 30th

1124
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:01,440
for that actual release.

1125
01:06:02,360 --> 01:06:06,920
This has been in development since 2015,

1126
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:11,080
and it was originally supposed to come in the summer of 2021.

1127
01:06:11,080 --> 01:06:14,360
And this, of course, is a remake of the 1994 first person RPG

1128
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:18,600
that's going to be coming for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One,

1129
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:20,720
and Xbox Series X.

1130
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:26,920
But Atari is also purchasing Night Dive Studios,

1131
01:06:27,160 --> 01:06:30,280
and they're buying it for 10 million in cash.

1132
01:06:30,560 --> 01:06:33,840
And this is supposed to help Atari expand their catalog

1133
01:06:34,080 --> 01:06:39,520
and using technology and boosting a retro focused strategy.

1134
01:06:40,280 --> 01:06:44,760
Although a lot of those recent retro releases out of Atari have not been bad.

1135
01:06:45,040 --> 01:06:48,640
So, you know, I don't mind if they're kind of continuing to lean into that

1136
01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:51,680
because a lot of the recent releases really haven't been bad.

1137
01:06:52,280 --> 01:06:55,160
But as we know, I mean, and certainly it's better than some of the other stuff

1138
01:06:55,160 --> 01:06:59,200
Atari's gotten into recently, like crypto, online casinos,

1139
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:01,920
and they're bringing up themed hotels here.

1140
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:04,800
We never did see the hotel.

1141
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:07,120
Let's give that one a chance first.

1142
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:11,200
I thought that sounded interesting, but no hotel as of yet anyway.

1143
01:07:12,080 --> 01:07:18,360
So anyway, Night Dive should be helping them to bolster their actual game

1144
01:07:18,360 --> 01:07:22,840
library a little bit with things that aren't necessarily just the retro stuff.

1145
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:27,240
So, all right, moving on, Dark Soccer.

1146
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:33,560
Couldn't hit get my button hit fast enough.

1147
01:07:34,600 --> 01:07:39,040
There's a comic that I was super into, so excited about when it came out,

1148
01:07:39,040 --> 01:07:42,600
which was I've been reading the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

1149
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:45,160
more recent issues, which I super love.

1150
01:07:46,040 --> 01:07:49,600
But there was a series that came out called The Last Ronin,

1151
01:07:49,960 --> 01:07:56,880
which is about this sort of super futuristic New York area.

1152
01:07:57,280 --> 01:08:01,400
And of the four turtles, only one of them survived.

1153
01:08:02,600 --> 01:08:06,400
And you don't find out who it is until the end of the issue.

1154
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:11,400
But they are working on a game based on it.

1155
01:08:11,600 --> 01:08:14,160
It is a really good series, but it is dark.

1156
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:16,600
It was published in 2020.

1157
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:19,200
It was a five issue miniseries by IDW.

1158
01:08:21,280 --> 01:08:24,920
So at any rate, the game is going to play something

1159
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:27,840
they're actually working with Paramount,

1160
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:32,360
but it's going to be a little bit more adult themed,

1161
01:08:33,720 --> 01:08:37,080
a little bit darker, grittier,

1162
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:41,600
and it's supposed to play as they've outlined

1163
01:08:41,680 --> 01:08:43,840
a little bit more like God of War,

1164
01:08:45,320 --> 01:08:46,800
you know, very mature.

1165
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:49,560
They don't OK, they don't have a developer yet,

1166
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:53,640
and they think it's going to be at least a few years out

1167
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:55,920
from any sort of release date.

1168
01:08:55,920 --> 01:09:00,840
But I think it's I think it's pretty I would play the hell out of it.

1169
01:09:00,840 --> 01:09:01,680
I really liked it.

1170
01:09:03,160 --> 01:09:05,400
I have to admit, I didn't know a lot about it until I saw the story,

1171
01:09:05,400 --> 01:09:07,880
because, you know, anything Ninja Turtle related Tiger Claw

1172
01:09:07,880 --> 01:09:08,760
posts in our Discord.

1173
01:09:08,760 --> 01:09:09,640
So that's how I saw it.

1174
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:11,840
And I was kind of like looking at it going, oh, that's interesting.

1175
01:09:11,840 --> 01:09:12,920
I didn't like the new movie.

1176
01:09:12,920 --> 01:09:14,480
I didn't even know that was a thing.

1177
01:09:14,480 --> 01:09:17,400
Yeah. And then.

1178
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:18,480
Wait, new movie?

1179
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:20,600
Yeah, there's a new animated movie that's coming out.

1180
01:09:20,920 --> 01:09:23,320
The animation style is sort of like the

1181
01:09:24,040 --> 01:09:26,360
not exactly, but kind of like the

1182
01:09:27,400 --> 01:09:31,920
enter the Spider-Verse stuff, like it's that karmic, a comic panel style.

1183
01:09:32,120 --> 01:09:33,320
It looks really nice.

1184
01:09:33,320 --> 01:09:35,960
Like it, I think it's going to be cool.

1185
01:09:35,960 --> 01:09:39,480
Well, but anyway, the big thing that I'm looking forward to

1186
01:09:39,480 --> 01:09:42,160
is seeing how the different weapons are incorporated,

1187
01:09:42,160 --> 01:09:44,960
because the survivor carries the weapons of all four of them.

1188
01:09:46,120 --> 01:09:48,080
And on top of that,

1189
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:53,440
in the comic, he would hear sort of, I guess, like the voices of his brothers.

1190
01:09:54,360 --> 01:09:56,120
And talk to them.

1191
01:09:56,120 --> 01:10:00,760
So I'm wondering if maybe hearing those different voices in gameplay might,

1192
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:05,800
you know, access, like like talk, talk to the voice of this one

1193
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:09,600
to get insight on this might give you different pointers

1194
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:11,120
and clues throughout the game.

1195
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:11,840
I think that would be cool.

1196
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:15,920
All right. Yeah, I'm looking forward to it.

1197
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:18,720
And if you want to join our Discord to talk about,

1198
01:10:18,720 --> 01:10:21,240
you know, Ninja Turtles or other things throughout the weeks,

1199
01:10:21,240 --> 01:10:23,280
we get a lot of neat news

1200
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:26,600
posted in the Orange Dance Radio channel and some of our other channels as well.

1201
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:29,800
Head on over to our Discord over at vognetwork.com.

1202
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:32,440
That's vognetwork.com slash Discord.

1203
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:37,440
All right. This this next story is is something else, Loki.

1204
01:10:39,680 --> 01:10:42,800
Yeah, it's it's unique, that's for sure.

1205
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:51,000
So apparently there is a game that's been made by MSCHF,

1206
01:10:51,400 --> 01:10:53,360
which is a Brooklyn based art company

1207
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:57,320
that is called Tax Heaven 3000.

1208
01:10:57,320 --> 01:11:03,280
It is a dating sim that helps you do your taxes.

1209
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:07,640
It's interesting for sure.

1210
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:12,640
So it will actually help you walk through

1211
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:16,840
the process of filing a 1040 US tax return.

1212
01:11:17,720 --> 01:11:21,640
The problem is, though, it's been delisted off of the websites

1213
01:11:21,640 --> 01:11:24,800
that it's been on, probably because it asks for your Social Security number,

1214
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:29,680
which, yes, that is part of the tax process, is providing that information.

1215
01:11:29,680 --> 01:11:32,000
However, would I trust the game to do that?

1216
01:11:34,720 --> 01:11:36,360
Questionable.

1217
01:11:36,360 --> 01:11:39,640
It doesn't appear that the game is supposed to connect to the Internet,

1218
01:11:40,120 --> 01:11:42,800
but still kind of fishy.

1219
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:45,440
So it has been removed from Steam.

1220
01:11:45,440 --> 01:11:49,160
And I think the download is not available anymore for itch.io either.

1221
01:11:49,160 --> 01:11:50,520
But it looks silly.

1222
01:11:50,520 --> 01:11:54,000
And, you know, it does allow you to actually file your taxes.

1223
01:11:54,200 --> 01:11:58,040
But, you know, to be fair, I mean, tax season is right now.

1224
01:11:58,040 --> 01:12:00,680
And I mean, there's lots of free websites that you can do it through

1225
01:12:00,680 --> 01:12:04,200
that are way more reputable and probably

1226
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:06,480
a lot more easier to actually file your taxes.

1227
01:12:06,480 --> 01:12:08,800
But it's still a novel idea.

1228
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:12,560
I it's interesting because I heard this story at first and I kind of laughed at it.

1229
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:14,800
And I went, LOL, of course, there's something like this.

1230
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:19,000
But then the more I thought about it, I was like, is this is this really so bad?

1231
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:24,760
Like, it's not like I think this is more respectable

1232
01:12:24,760 --> 01:12:27,280
than some of the things these companies try to pull over.

1233
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:31,600
And some of these websites that have you do your taxes, that bombard you with spam.

1234
01:12:31,880 --> 01:12:35,440
Oh, it looks like you forgot to finish your taxes or trying to upsell

1235
01:12:35,440 --> 01:12:36,960
all this other stuff and all this other crap.

1236
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:41,840
Like I there's a part of me that kind of looks at this and goes in a weird way.

1237
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:45,520
This is this is it's either satire and it's really good satire,

1238
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:51,040
or it's a really interesting way to try to get a hold of a market

1239
01:12:51,320 --> 01:12:56,720
that otherwise doesn't usually think about a fun way to kind of do this stuff.

1240
01:12:57,680 --> 01:13:02,040
Well, yeah, taxes are a slog a lot of times, so it's an interesting idea.

1241
01:13:02,280 --> 01:13:06,040
If if there was some way to like, they could have like an independent

1242
01:13:06,040 --> 01:13:09,360
security firm or something like that, take a look at it, make sure like, OK,

1243
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:12,880
hey, we're certifying that this isn't going to send your social security

1244
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:16,360
number and personal information out on the Internet, then.

1245
01:13:16,360 --> 01:13:17,840
Yeah, sure. You know, why not?

1246
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:18,760
Let's let's roll with it.

1247
01:13:18,760 --> 01:13:21,760
But like, I think that's just where people are a little weary,

1248
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:24,840
because, like, you know, you all know who these developers are.

1249
01:13:24,840 --> 01:13:28,720
I mean, obviously, these this company has worked with like big names

1250
01:13:28,720 --> 01:13:31,080
like Lil Nas X and stuff on other projects.

1251
01:13:31,560 --> 01:13:35,080
So they're somewhat reputable, but like, you know, you can never tell

1252
01:13:35,080 --> 01:13:37,160
like who's developing your games and stuff like that.

1253
01:13:37,160 --> 01:13:38,480
You don't know.

1254
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:39,880
You wouldn't want to trust them

1255
01:13:39,880 --> 01:13:43,400
with that kind of information because leaks happen all the time. So

1256
01:13:44,680 --> 01:13:47,040
that's the only thing I think people are a little bit wary on.

1257
01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:50,560
And obviously, that's probably why it's been delisted off of there.

1258
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:55,120
But like, I mean, I assume security side,

1259
01:13:55,400 --> 01:13:58,400
you know, security aside, if if it were completely secure.

1260
01:13:58,600 --> 01:13:59,800
Yeah, I think it's a great idea.

1261
01:13:59,800 --> 01:14:01,280
I think it's cool.

1262
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:04,480
Well, this is so Fixation Gaze has a comment in chat here,

1263
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:07,080
and then I think it kind of leans into what you're talking about,

1264
01:14:07,080 --> 01:14:07,960
where you're going with this.

1265
01:14:07,960 --> 01:14:10,720
Fixation Gaze says TurboTax makes it racing themed.

1266
01:14:10,720 --> 01:14:12,880
I'd rather date a cute girl.

1267
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:14,960
And Dark Soccer, I saw you said same.

1268
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:19,960
And I and that's the thing is that I can't help but feel like

1269
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:21,880
who's the company behind TurboTax?

1270
01:14:21,880 --> 01:14:23,560
Intuit, I think is the name of them.

1271
01:14:23,560 --> 01:14:27,400
I can't help but feel like come tax season 2024,

1272
01:14:27,400 --> 01:14:30,920
or I guess it would be tax season 2023 in 2024.

1273
01:14:30,920 --> 01:14:31,960
You know what I mean?

1274
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:35,280
I can't help but feel like Intuit is going to see what's going on here.

1275
01:14:35,560 --> 01:14:39,480
And they're I'm not saying they're going to have an anime thing,

1276
01:14:39,480 --> 01:14:41,560
but they're going to have they're going to be like, ooh,

1277
01:14:41,800 --> 01:14:45,800
what if we did like a video game, more immersive type of approach

1278
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:49,720
and hire like an outsourced developer to do some type of thing

1279
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:53,360
and like put it together and do that whole thing and have it through that?

1280
01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:55,720
I have to end Fixation Gaze.

1281
01:14:55,720 --> 01:14:57,920
I understand you're saying, God, I hope so.

1282
01:14:57,920 --> 01:15:00,160
KFC did a love sim and it was popular as hell.

1283
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:01,680
In a way, yes.

1284
01:15:01,680 --> 01:15:05,200
But I actually have to say, if Intuit was allowed to do that now,

1285
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:07,160
I'd actually be kind of pissed off.

1286
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:10,400
That this got shut down.

1287
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:13,440
Now, granted, it is the fault of the company that put this together

1288
01:15:13,440 --> 01:15:16,600
to not think about those security motions in place and dah, dah, dah, dah.

1289
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:20,520
But I would be more irritated at the fact that the big company

1290
01:15:20,520 --> 01:15:24,560
took the little company's idea because they had a legal department

1291
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:27,720
to make it better, make it more functional, if you will.

1292
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:31,800
That part of it would kind of piss me off, I think.

1293
01:15:33,120 --> 01:15:35,320
But I feel I feel like.

1294
01:15:36,760 --> 01:15:40,640
And thank you, he says, oh, that's so fair, I want them to hire them,

1295
01:15:40,640 --> 01:15:43,840
give the small guys money, much better solution, I like that.

1296
01:15:44,480 --> 01:15:47,440
But I feel like that's not a company like just sorry,

1297
01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:50,160
just based on the behaviors I see in the TurboTax software and all that.

1298
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:51,960
I feel like they're going to go to somewhere

1299
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,840
they can get an outsource in another country

1300
01:15:55,160 --> 01:16:00,480
and have it developed to be like this and do that whole thing.

1301
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:02,280
Yeah. So watch it.

1302
01:16:02,280 --> 01:16:04,640
It's going to be next year's tax season.

1303
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:07,280
So apparently, even though it's been delisted from Steam,

1304
01:16:07,280 --> 01:16:09,120
so itch.io still has it up.

1305
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:11,160
I didn't realize that the game is not actually out yet.

1306
01:16:11,160 --> 01:16:12,960
So it's coming out April 4th.

1307
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:15,920
So if you're still interested, it is on itch.io.

1308
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:18,800
You can still get it that way.

1309
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:20,240
How do you ultimately file?

1310
01:16:20,280 --> 01:16:23,400
Does it e-transmit or do you like since, or do you print?

1311
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:27,880
It's basically it looks like that you.

1312
01:16:28,680 --> 01:16:31,360
Yeah, you can either print or download it when you're done.

1313
01:16:31,360 --> 01:16:34,520
So it basically fills up the form for you and then you print or download it.

1314
01:16:34,520 --> 01:16:37,600
And I guess you would e-file that way somehow. I don't know.

1315
01:16:38,200 --> 01:16:40,520
I'll be perfectly honest.

1316
01:16:40,520 --> 01:16:43,840
I don't want my tax thing as a game. I'm sorry.

1317
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:46,600
I would rather fill out the form.

1318
01:16:47,560 --> 01:16:51,800
Have it be uninteresting, but factual without any fluff.

1319
01:16:52,920 --> 01:16:56,080
And get my taxes filed and get my money.

1320
01:16:57,400 --> 01:16:59,400
Taxes don't need to be a game.

1321
01:16:59,400 --> 01:17:01,560
I can see pros and cons to both.

1322
01:17:01,560 --> 01:17:02,960
I love the choice.

1323
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:07,320
And to me, this is very similar to traffic school.

1324
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:09,560
And how do you like, you know, obviously,

1325
01:17:09,560 --> 01:17:11,800
we all try to avoid getting a ticket and all that stuff.

1326
01:17:12,160 --> 01:17:15,680
But if you ever get a ticket, you could go to stand up comedy

1327
01:17:15,680 --> 01:17:18,640
traffic school if you want, where the whole thing is.

1328
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:21,280
Yeah. And I already see Rolling Your Eyes, Dark Sakura.

1329
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:24,120
And that would honestly, that probably be what I would want to do.

1330
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:28,280
But if you want to go to a, for lack of a better term,

1331
01:17:28,440 --> 01:17:31,920
normal traffic school, that's just, all right, give me the facts.

1332
01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:35,280
Just don't don't be funny about it. Just normal classroom.

1333
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:38,040
Let's get this over with online training.

1334
01:17:38,040 --> 01:17:41,400
And just did the test and was done in 10 minutes.

1335
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:44,520
So but there's that choice.

1336
01:17:44,520 --> 01:17:48,240
So I like that that would be kind of available. So.

1337
01:17:49,280 --> 01:17:52,240
And yes, April 15th is typically tax day,

1338
01:17:52,240 --> 01:17:55,520
although holidays have been fluctuating that day a little bit weird calendars.

1339
01:17:55,520 --> 01:17:57,080
It's around the 15th.

1340
01:17:57,080 --> 01:17:59,360
So it looks like April 18th this year.

1341
01:17:59,360 --> 01:18:04,200
And also this year there's like things like with the weather and stuff.

1342
01:18:04,200 --> 01:18:06,800
I think that it's possible for certain people to have it delayed

1343
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:09,000
until like September even. But.

1344
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,160
Yeah. Yeah.

1345
01:18:13,640 --> 01:18:15,520
So fixation is April 1st,

1346
01:18:15,520 --> 01:18:19,400
maybe the cutoff for TurboTax before the prices go up,

1347
01:18:19,640 --> 01:18:22,440
because the last two weeks before you file your taxes,

1348
01:18:22,440 --> 01:18:25,960
they're going to jack those prices sky high because that's what those companies do.

1349
01:18:26,320 --> 01:18:27,440
Just don't use TurboTax.

1350
01:18:27,440 --> 01:18:29,760
Seriously, like there's websites out there

1351
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:33,040
that you can use that are probably way more intuitive.

1352
01:18:33,040 --> 01:18:34,720
And I think it's like.

1353
01:18:35,240 --> 01:18:39,400
It's free to e-file your just regular federal

1354
01:18:39,400 --> 01:18:43,120
and if you want to your state of things like 17 bucks, it's like it's so.

1355
01:18:43,480 --> 01:18:45,520
Minimal. And I do it every year.

1356
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:49,000
Yeah, it's just so easy.

1357
01:18:49,200 --> 01:18:53,480
Our our lady who used to help us, she passed away a few years ago.

1358
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:56,400
R.I.P. Kathy.

1359
01:18:56,400 --> 01:19:01,280
But but yeah, she basically walked us through so many different things

1360
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:04,600
that we just use the age in our block software. Yeah.

1361
01:19:06,120 --> 01:19:09,000
All right. Anyway, tax tips from Orange Lounge Radio.

1362
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,240
Bet you didn't know you'd get that this week. All right.

1363
01:19:11,280 --> 01:19:13,880
Moving on, let's go to one more.

1364
01:19:13,880 --> 01:19:15,880
If you're confused, hire an accountant.

1365
01:19:15,880 --> 01:19:18,360
Yeah, that's that's very true.

1366
01:19:18,360 --> 01:19:20,240
Disclaimer, we are not accountants.

1367
01:19:20,240 --> 01:19:22,680
We're just, you know, nerds of the podcast. All right.

1368
01:19:23,320 --> 01:19:26,320
I can rock an actuarial table for your mortgage, OK?

1369
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:30,200
I used to work for a mortgage company.

1370
01:19:30,200 --> 01:19:33,240
All right. Well, here's what you can expect to hear on Orange Lounge Radio

1371
01:19:33,240 --> 01:19:36,200
every single goddamn week for the next two years.

1372
01:19:36,200 --> 01:19:39,240
No, the Activision Blizzard Microsoft deal.

1373
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:44,840
What's the latest and greatest MST3K?

1374
01:19:45,680 --> 01:19:47,720
Well, whoopty shit.

1375
01:19:47,720 --> 01:19:50,200
Well, some people are saying whoopty shit this week

1376
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:53,720
because there was a pretty big hurdle that was actually cleared in all of this.

1377
01:19:53,720 --> 01:19:56,360
And that is the UK regulators.

1378
01:19:56,360 --> 01:19:59,480
The UK regulators did announce a provisional finding

1379
01:19:59,800 --> 01:20:03,280
that the acquisition of Activision Blizzard by Microsoft

1380
01:20:03,520 --> 01:20:06,040
wouldn't harm competition.

1381
01:20:06,040 --> 01:20:09,120
So there's not going to be a need, at least in the UK,

1382
01:20:09,120 --> 01:20:12,120
again, this has to still clear the US and, you know, other global markets,

1383
01:20:12,360 --> 01:20:16,280
but that there's no need to spin off Call of Duty and so forth.

1384
01:20:16,760 --> 01:20:22,200
In a quote, the CMA Competition of Markets Authority in the UK said in a quote,

1385
01:20:22,960 --> 01:20:25,840
while the CMA's original analysis indicated

1386
01:20:26,080 --> 01:20:29,800
that the strategy would be profitable under most scenarios, new data,

1387
01:20:29,800 --> 01:20:32,360
which provides better insight into the actual purchasing behavior

1388
01:20:32,360 --> 01:20:35,920
of Call of Duty gamers indicates that this strategy would be significantly

1389
01:20:35,920 --> 01:20:38,200
loss making under any plausible scenario.

1390
01:20:38,520 --> 01:20:42,360
On this basis, meaning if they were to make Call of Duty exclusive to Microsoft,

1391
01:20:42,360 --> 01:20:44,480
it would actually lose Microsoft money.

1392
01:20:44,480 --> 01:20:48,440
On this basis, the updated analysis now shows that would not be commercially

1393
01:20:48,440 --> 01:20:52,400
beneficial to Microsoft to make Call of Duty exclusive to Xbox following the deal,

1394
01:20:52,520 --> 01:20:55,600
but that Microsoft will instead still have the incentive

1395
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:57,800
to continue making the game available on PlayStation.

1396
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,360
It all comes down to Call of Duty.

1397
01:21:00,360 --> 01:21:04,760
Now, CMA is still investigating cloud gaming and Game Pass.

1398
01:21:04,760 --> 01:21:08,320
No decision on that is expected until 26th April,

1399
01:21:08,320 --> 01:21:09,640
since we are talking about the UK here.

1400
01:21:11,320 --> 01:21:14,720
They're still looking at Game Pass, but Call of Duty was sort of viewed

1401
01:21:14,720 --> 01:21:18,160
to be the biggest sticking point in this entire thing.

1402
01:21:18,280 --> 01:21:22,920
And now that that's cleared by the UK, this is a huge hurdle cleared for this.

1403
01:21:23,040 --> 01:21:27,440
And a lot of people that were kind of betting on this, metaphorically,

1404
01:21:28,280 --> 01:21:32,120
were assuming that the UK was going to put a stop to this and it was going to be over.

1405
01:21:32,240 --> 01:21:38,040
So the fact that this went through now and a lot of this, too, is kind of Sony's own fault.

1406
01:21:38,720 --> 01:21:43,880
And so because Sony admitted that they were just trying to stop this deal,

1407
01:21:43,880 --> 01:21:48,280
that they really don't have a financial that that was going to be that's going to be looked

1408
01:21:48,280 --> 01:21:52,680
at as a defining moment in this whole thing, the way that Sony kind of botched that answer,

1409
01:21:52,920 --> 01:21:54,800
although it was also an honest answer.

1410
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:56,560
Let's be real. It was the answer.

1411
01:21:57,160 --> 01:22:04,200
So anyhow, SHO 100 Matt says the FTC and whatever members of Congress will make a scene

1412
01:22:04,200 --> 01:22:07,960
for in a few weeks in the public sphere, but I still think this deal happens.

1413
01:22:07,960 --> 01:22:12,280
Oh, if that whole stuff with TikTok is any indication.

1414
01:22:12,280 --> 01:22:13,320
Oh, boy.

1415
01:22:13,880 --> 01:22:17,960
But I don't think I don't think I mean, you're not going to see that in this type of thing.

1416
01:22:17,960 --> 01:22:20,520
I'm being a little bit dramatic.

1417
01:22:20,520 --> 01:22:24,920
You're not going to see them in front of well, I don't think I guess anything could happen.

1418
01:22:24,920 --> 01:22:28,680
But procedurally, that is not something that should be happening as a part of that.

1419
01:22:28,960 --> 01:22:36,600
So anyway, all right, let's move let's move on to a simpler time when Congress didn't understand

1420
01:22:36,600 --> 01:22:37,400
video games at all.

1421
01:22:37,400 --> 01:22:38,640
Well, actually, that still is the case.

1422
01:22:38,640 --> 01:22:41,400
But anyway, we're going to just move on to our next segment.

1423
01:22:41,400 --> 01:22:57,560
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull

1424
01:22:57,560 --> 01:22:59,400
out a classic and tell you about it.

1425
01:22:59,800 --> 01:23:02,520
It's time for the classic game of the week.

1426
01:23:03,080 --> 01:23:05,800
Um, who picked the classic game this week?

1427
01:23:05,800 --> 01:23:08,640
Because is this is this a secret Loki pick?

1428
01:23:08,640 --> 01:23:09,560
What's going on here?

1429
01:23:09,560 --> 01:23:10,800
This looks like a Loki pick.

1430
01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:13,440
No, but I thought of Loki when I think.

1431
01:23:13,800 --> 01:23:14,080
All right.

1432
01:23:14,080 --> 01:23:15,560
What is the game of the week?

1433
01:23:16,280 --> 01:23:18,280
The game of the week is Grand Theft Auto Vice City.

1434
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:19,080
Wow.

1435
01:23:19,960 --> 01:23:27,080
And yes, it's actually a a twenty one year old game.

1436
01:23:27,080 --> 01:23:27,920
It can drink.

1437
01:23:29,360 --> 01:23:31,880
It's as old as this show about.

1438
01:23:34,160 --> 01:23:37,480
And I picked it actually for for certain certain reasons.

1439
01:23:37,480 --> 01:23:45,760
Um, but yeah, I know I almost went with Grand Theft Auto three because Grand Theft Auto

1440
01:23:45,760 --> 01:23:52,880
three was the first one to abandon that sort of overhead view and go on to the the third

1441
01:23:52,880 --> 01:23:53,640
person view.

1442
01:23:53,720 --> 01:24:00,240
But Vice City had some massive improvements over Grand Theft Auto three.

1443
01:24:00,240 --> 01:24:05,800
And while Grand Theft Auto three went into creating immersion and a story and everything,

1444
01:24:06,120 --> 01:24:09,320
I really think the formula was perfected with Vice City.

1445
01:24:10,040 --> 01:24:15,760
So, um, to go back into this, there were a lot.

1446
01:24:16,280 --> 01:24:21,600
Well, again, it was it came out in 2002, an action adventure game developed by Rockstar

1447
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:27,200
North, published by Rockstar Games, and it is the fourth Grand Theft Auto game and I'm

1448
01:24:27,200 --> 01:24:30,120
sorry, the fourth in the series and the sixth installment overall.

1449
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:41,640
It is set in 1986 with a pretty freaking amazing soundtrack, just saying where you are in Vice

1450
01:24:41,640 --> 01:24:49,840
City, which is based off of Miami and Miami Beach, and you follow a mobster named Tommy,

1451
01:24:50,160 --> 01:24:59,200
who has been released from jail and is it's his rise to power again, but not necessarily

1452
01:24:59,200 --> 01:25:08,120
just that, but his, you know, just a statement about the area, about the time, about that

1453
01:25:08,120 --> 01:25:10,840
world, of course, you know, a little bit more glamorized.

1454
01:25:11,400 --> 01:25:15,960
But the you know, the great thing about the game that started again with Grand Theft Auto

1455
01:25:15,960 --> 01:25:24,640
three is that it's an open open world, you know, it's and it's got real people in it,

1456
01:25:24,640 --> 01:25:35,520
you know, like it touches on the immigration issues that were going on in Miami and along

1457
01:25:35,520 --> 01:25:43,760
the Gulf Coast, especially with Cuban, Haitian immigrants, biker games, the crack epidemic,

1458
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:47,280
the and a glam glam metal.

1459
01:25:47,680 --> 01:25:53,240
We can't forget glam metal, you know, the whole the whole beautiful butt rock back in the

1460
01:25:53,280 --> 01:26:03,320
day. But the game itself had two major influences and it was Scarface and Miami Vice, you know,

1461
01:26:03,920 --> 01:26:06,040
the original Miami Vice, not the remake.

1462
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,360
Yeah, very, very Scarface.

1463
01:26:10,040 --> 01:26:20,840
But it had they they started off with those sort of blueprints, the universe idea, and then

1464
01:26:20,840 --> 01:26:25,320
they built their game world to fit that inspiration in that general time field.

1465
01:26:26,240 --> 01:26:35,360
They had the team spend a lot of time in Miami and looking at landmarks and trying to

1466
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:36,680
recreate some of these.

1467
01:26:36,680 --> 01:26:39,760
And that's been an ongoing theme in a lot of the Grand Theft Auto games.

1468
01:26:40,200 --> 01:26:47,440
I mean, like Liberty City is based off New York and has, you know, some recreations of

1469
01:26:47,440 --> 01:26:51,840
some of those, you know, areas at least trying to fit those areas where San Andreas had,

1470
01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:57,040
like, you know, the the Chinese theater, for example, and other parts of Los Angeles.

1471
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:05,400
But going back, going back to this one, this game was actually considered as one of the

1472
01:27:05,400 --> 01:27:08,280
greatest video games ever made by many, many lists.

1473
01:27:08,560 --> 01:27:13,600
And it made Game of the Year for a bunch of different publications.

1474
01:27:14,040 --> 01:27:17,240
It has gotten so many ports.

1475
01:27:18,080 --> 01:27:20,760
We'll get into that a little bit later.

1476
01:27:23,360 --> 01:27:28,680
But anyway, as I was saying, it's an action adventure game is played from third person.

1477
01:27:28,680 --> 01:27:37,760
You play Tommy Verchetti, who has different story objectives that he needs to achieve.

1478
01:27:37,760 --> 01:27:44,600
And then there's also little side jobs and there's a free roaming aspect, very open world.

1479
01:27:45,520 --> 01:27:48,280
And you can just do nothing but explore.

1480
01:27:48,280 --> 01:27:53,800
You can spend a day just doing whatever you want, like actual people do.

1481
01:27:54,720 --> 01:27:59,440
And it is composed on these two islands with several small areas within like, you know,

1482
01:27:59,840 --> 01:28:06,640
like a neighborhood, you know, the islands unlock more areas as the story progresses.

1483
01:28:06,640 --> 01:28:11,920
You know, you run, jump, drive, you have melee attacks, you have all kinds of weapons

1484
01:28:11,920 --> 01:28:19,560
and explosives, such as a Colt Python, an M60 machine gun, a minigun, a sniper rifle,

1485
01:28:19,560 --> 01:28:23,800
a rocket launcher, you know, because I everyone doesn't ever have like a rocket

1486
01:28:23,800 --> 01:28:25,520
launcher just hanging out in their trunk or something.

1487
01:28:26,080 --> 01:28:27,120
Oh, yeah, in the garage.

1488
01:28:27,840 --> 01:28:35,240
Yeah, but you you actually, you know, can purchase illegal weapons from firearm dealers.

1489
01:28:35,400 --> 01:28:37,360
You can find them on the ground.

1490
01:28:37,480 --> 01:28:38,840
That always makes me laugh.

1491
01:28:39,120 --> 01:28:41,800
You retrieve them, you know, from dead people or just in general area.

1492
01:28:41,800 --> 01:28:46,800
You have an auto aim feature and you have your your health meter.

1493
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:48,040
You can pick up health pickups.

1494
01:28:48,040 --> 01:28:49,280
You can get body armor.

1495
01:28:51,080 --> 01:28:57,720
And then, of course, when you, quote, die in game, you respawn at the at the hospital,

1496
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:01,200
losing your weapons and armor and some of your money.

1497
01:29:02,160 --> 01:29:07,240
And then, of course, you associate with her, Matt says, I mean, it is Florida,

1498
01:29:08,600 --> 01:29:14,200
but you also can commit crimes and it builds up your wanted meter on your HUD.

1499
01:29:14,560 --> 01:29:17,480
And so it increases the more crimes you commit.

1500
01:29:19,240 --> 01:29:26,400
And so your wanted meter, if you're encountered, like, say, by police, you

1501
01:29:26,400 --> 01:29:32,480
have to drive around or turn off or hide to get them off of your ass.

1502
01:29:33,120 --> 01:29:38,080
So like there's all kinds of other like interesting little mini games in there,

1503
01:29:38,400 --> 01:29:44,920
like vigilante vigilantism, firefighting, paramedics driving a taxi.

1504
01:29:46,080 --> 01:29:51,600
You can buy businesses like a porn studio and a taxi company.

1505
01:29:51,960 --> 01:29:56,360
You can own clubs, you know, all kinds of stuff like that.

1506
01:29:56,520 --> 01:30:00,720
And then, you know, and I'm not going to get too much into the story.

1507
01:30:00,720 --> 01:30:05,800
If you really if you haven't already played it and you care about it, there's videos.

1508
01:30:07,120 --> 01:30:16,200
But but the particular game was started when GTA three was finishing its completion.

1509
01:30:17,440 --> 01:30:23,160
Just early development, like 3D models, really just getting that off the ground.

1510
01:30:23,160 --> 01:30:28,800
And then they were talking about like making a mission pack for GTA three.

1511
01:30:29,280 --> 01:30:34,160
And then instead of that, as they were going through it, they decided to make a GTA four.

1512
01:30:35,280 --> 01:30:40,480
The game was announced on May 22nd, 2002 at E3.

1513
01:30:41,480 --> 01:30:46,360
And it was at the time, Rockstar's North most expensive game.

1514
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:48,840
The budget exceeded five million.

1515
01:30:48,840 --> 01:30:54,240
And then they had to postpone it a little bit and then.

1516
01:30:56,480 --> 01:30:59,840
It had like a number of various releases.

1517
01:31:00,280 --> 01:31:05,680
It was released for PlayStation two on October 29th in North America, November 8th in Europe.

1518
01:31:05,720 --> 01:31:07,280
This is in 2002.

1519
01:31:07,680 --> 01:31:12,640
Capcom published the game in Japan on May 20th, 2004 for PS2 and Windows,

1520
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:17,080
and it was added to the Rockstar Games Launcher in September of 2002.

1521
01:31:17,080 --> 01:31:20,400
Rockstar Games Launcher in September 2019.

1522
01:31:22,640 --> 01:31:25,840
Now, I'll be honest, it's not my kind of game.

1523
01:31:25,880 --> 01:31:27,360
I don't enjoy.

1524
01:31:28,600 --> 01:31:34,640
The themes of the game, however, I fucking love watching people play it because I like

1525
01:31:34,640 --> 01:31:43,280
seeing how in depth the universe that these people live in, how how in depth and involved it is.

1526
01:31:43,280 --> 01:31:44,880
It's like, you know, me watching a movie.

1527
01:31:45,080 --> 01:31:47,760
The movie could be utter shit with the worst actors ever.

1528
01:31:47,760 --> 01:31:53,880
But if it has an engaging universe, I'm down, you know, like.

1529
01:31:55,200 --> 01:31:58,520
I'm not going to name any other examples on there, but it really

1530
01:31:59,920 --> 01:32:06,200
you can even see it if you look at the cover of the game, that that major Miami vice

1531
01:32:06,200 --> 01:32:13,040
with the pastels and the and the neons, just that whole I mean, sort of like how the retro

1532
01:32:13,040 --> 01:32:17,600
new wave things started coming back up a few years ago, very much makes me think of that.

1533
01:32:17,880 --> 01:32:20,760
So how well did it do when I make a guess?

1534
01:32:21,640 --> 01:32:24,560
Damn well, it printed money, it printed money.

1535
01:32:26,680 --> 01:32:33,800
Metacritic calculated an average store, a store, a score of ninety five out of a hundred.

1536
01:32:34,600 --> 01:32:36,280
That's pretty damn good.

1537
01:32:38,640 --> 01:32:42,040
It is the fifth highest rated PS2 game overall.

1538
01:32:43,480 --> 01:32:45,960
Tied with a few others, but, you know, overall,

1539
01:32:47,840 --> 01:32:51,920
a lot of the criticism for the game had more to do with the controls

1540
01:32:51,920 --> 01:32:54,560
and a few technical issues than anything else in the game.

1541
01:32:54,920 --> 01:32:58,120
It was considered to be one of the most impressive games.

1542
01:32:58,560 --> 01:33:04,240
And this is my favorite description of it from GameSpy's Raymond Padilla.

1543
01:33:04,960 --> 01:33:07,840
Deep, devilishly enjoyable and unique.

1544
01:33:08,400 --> 01:33:10,080
Devilishly enjoyable.

1545
01:33:10,080 --> 01:33:11,400
I'm going to steal that one day.

1546
01:33:12,040 --> 01:33:18,480
But let's go over just like with some of the other ratings were all game gave it a five out of five.

1547
01:33:19,600 --> 01:33:21,000
Eurogamer, ten out of ten.

1548
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:22,200
Gameformer, ten out of ten.

1549
01:33:22,200 --> 01:33:25,360
Game Revolution, a GameSpot, nine point six out of ten.

1550
01:33:25,720 --> 01:33:27,720
GameSpy, ninety five out of a hundred.

1551
01:33:27,720 --> 01:33:29,520
IGN, nine point seven out of ten.

1552
01:33:29,520 --> 01:33:32,880
So, I mean, really, really amazing.

1553
01:33:33,200 --> 01:33:37,280
And it got a vehicle to ride that the last game didn't have.

1554
01:33:37,280 --> 01:33:38,480
You can ride around on a motorcycle.

1555
01:33:38,480 --> 01:33:41,960
You know, get your own wood rash on.

1556
01:33:43,880 --> 01:33:50,280
But it's it's just the Windows version, even that came out in May 2003,

1557
01:33:50,600 --> 01:33:55,200
and it was also highly acclaimed with its scores rivaling

1558
01:33:55,400 --> 01:33:58,600
maybe just under the console version.

1559
01:34:00,560 --> 01:34:03,880
They were, you know, it got really

1560
01:34:04,840 --> 01:34:09,280
a lot of kudos for its improvement in the rendering, like improved draw distance

1561
01:34:09,800 --> 01:34:13,480
and fewer texture issues

1562
01:34:14,720 --> 01:34:17,760
and actually having very reasonable requirements.

1563
01:34:18,280 --> 01:34:24,960
So Vice City was also released on mobile devices December 2012.

1564
01:34:25,400 --> 01:34:26,960
It was mostly favorable.

1565
01:34:26,960 --> 01:34:31,120
You know, a lot of the problems with it, it had actually enhanced visuals,

1566
01:34:31,120 --> 01:34:33,120
but the problems with it were the touch screen controls.

1567
01:34:34,800 --> 01:34:37,200
It was pretty, pretty well received overall.

1568
01:34:38,400 --> 01:34:41,560
But yeah, the game has made so much money.

1569
01:34:41,560 --> 01:34:44,560
And honestly, people are still all about it.

1570
01:34:45,320 --> 01:34:47,320
But then, but then.

1571
01:34:48,360 --> 01:34:51,520
There were a few controversies

1572
01:34:51,520 --> 01:34:55,360
because you can't have a GTA game without, you know, controversies

1573
01:34:55,360 --> 01:34:57,000
and Grand Theft Auto.

1574
01:34:57,000 --> 01:35:02,040
No, I'm and the other reason I picked this one is

1575
01:35:02,040 --> 01:35:04,920
I didn't want to deal with the fucking hot coffee thing.

1576
01:35:06,960 --> 01:35:12,000
But anyway, part of, you know, people, of course,

1577
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:16,600
there was the violence issue, the objectification,

1578
01:35:16,760 --> 01:35:21,360
a lot of the ethnic stereotypes,

1579
01:35:23,600 --> 01:35:28,480
you know, just like, you know, showing that people immigrated

1580
01:35:28,480 --> 01:35:31,280
from a certain place were, you know,

1581
01:35:32,320 --> 01:35:34,760
drug dealers or thugs or whatever.

1582
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:39,240
But, you know, and of course,

1583
01:35:39,240 --> 01:35:43,920
and it was it was a mature game in Australia.

1584
01:35:43,920 --> 01:35:48,120
It was actually edited a lot to get an M.A.

1585
01:35:48,120 --> 01:35:50,760
15 plus classification.

1586
01:35:50,760 --> 01:35:53,680
And then there was later on an uncensored version

1587
01:35:53,680 --> 01:35:55,920
that came out over there that kept its classification.

1588
01:35:57,400 --> 01:36:01,280
There was a six hundred million dollar lawsuit

1589
01:36:01,280 --> 01:36:04,920
against Cody Posey, Rockstar Games, Take Two Interactive

1590
01:36:05,240 --> 01:36:07,880
and Sony claiming that

1591
01:36:09,760 --> 01:36:12,960
14 year old Cody Posey played the game obsessively

1592
01:36:12,960 --> 01:36:15,680
before murdering his father, stepmother and step sister

1593
01:36:16,280 --> 01:36:18,240
at a ranch in the Hondo, New Mexico.

1594
01:36:20,280 --> 01:36:24,000
And they were also, though, blaming Zoloft.

1595
01:36:24,480 --> 01:36:27,080
Just I take that I haven't killed anybody

1596
01:36:28,360 --> 01:36:29,320
that I'll talk about.

1597
01:36:29,320 --> 01:36:30,880
I'm kidding. Haven't. Haven't done it at all.

1598
01:36:31,800 --> 01:36:34,320
But the case was dismissed in 2007

1599
01:36:34,320 --> 01:36:38,720
as New Mexico had no jurisdiction for Sony or Take Two.

1600
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:46,400
Another there were other cases out there, as in Jack Thompson.

1601
01:36:48,760 --> 01:36:53,360
Not that name again, but it's been a few years.

1602
01:36:54,480 --> 01:36:55,880
I feel like it's been a decade.

1603
01:36:55,880 --> 01:36:59,400
He slid into obscurity some time ago and rightfully so.

1604
01:37:00,400 --> 01:37:02,760
Yeah, but he he brought up

1605
01:37:03,800 --> 01:37:08,760
a lawsuit about an eight year old named Devin Moore,

1606
01:37:08,760 --> 01:37:12,400
who killed two Alabama police officers and a dispatcher

1607
01:37:12,760 --> 01:37:15,720
before fleeing in a patrol car and was apprehended.

1608
01:37:16,040 --> 01:37:18,280
And he was quoted saying, life is like a video game.

1609
01:37:18,280 --> 01:37:19,800
Everyone's got to die sometime.

1610
01:37:21,640 --> 01:37:26,840
But. Thompson removed himself from the case,

1611
01:37:27,840 --> 01:37:30,760
actually, from a couple of cases that he had been involved in

1612
01:37:30,760 --> 01:37:33,360
because of his unprofessional conduct.

1613
01:37:34,520 --> 01:37:38,640
The Supreme Court rejected an appeal to and they dismissed the case

1614
01:37:39,040 --> 01:37:42,800
and rejected the appeal by the defendants to dismiss the case.

1615
01:37:44,160 --> 01:37:47,520
Moving on the psychic readers network.

1616
01:37:48,520 --> 01:37:52,560
And they sued Rockstar over a character named Ante Pollay,

1617
01:37:53,120 --> 01:37:55,760
which doesn't that mean chicken play?

1618
01:37:56,240 --> 01:38:00,160
Anyway, saying that the characters between her and

1619
01:38:02,240 --> 01:38:04,600
Yuri Harris, who voiced the character,

1620
01:38:06,760 --> 01:38:09,800
that it was copyright infringement

1621
01:38:09,800 --> 01:38:13,480
and that it was it was really just parody.

1622
01:38:13,720 --> 01:38:16,440
So, yeah, there were

1623
01:38:17,440 --> 01:38:20,120
its legacy has been pretty, pretty intense.

1624
01:38:20,120 --> 01:38:23,520
You know, it's definitely raised the bar for for video games since then.

1625
01:38:23,840 --> 01:38:26,440
Oh, gosh. Yeah, I think it was disbarred a while ago.

1626
01:38:26,440 --> 01:38:29,360
I don't know. I didn't care enough about the about the loser to

1627
01:38:30,040 --> 01:38:32,880
look into what happened to him.

1628
01:38:32,880 --> 01:38:34,880
But it has had so many releases.

1629
01:38:35,400 --> 01:38:38,840
So there for all the ports

1630
01:38:39,280 --> 01:38:41,880
after the PS2 version, there was a Windows version.

1631
01:38:43,640 --> 01:38:46,960
There was a GameCube version that was planned, but canceled.

1632
01:38:47,320 --> 01:38:50,160
It was bundled with Grand Theft Auto three and a compilation

1633
01:38:50,160 --> 01:38:52,840
titled Grand Theft Auto Double Pack on Xbox.

1634
01:38:53,880 --> 01:38:57,720
The Xbox version also had a custom soundtrack

1635
01:38:58,120 --> 01:39:00,920
and improved audio models, reflections.

1636
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,600
And it also the double pack was also bundled with

1637
01:39:04,600 --> 01:39:07,800
San Andreas compilation called Grand Theft Auto, the trilogy.

1638
01:39:09,240 --> 01:39:14,960
The trilogy was also released for Mac OS X, November 12, 2010.

1639
01:39:15,240 --> 01:39:17,320
It's OS X, not OS X people.

1640
01:39:17,520 --> 01:39:19,840
X is a Roman numeral.

1641
01:39:20,680 --> 01:39:25,440
It was also released on iOS and Android,

1642
01:39:26,840 --> 01:39:29,480
following more of the Windows version of the game,

1643
01:39:29,480 --> 01:39:32,120
but had enhanced visuals in the customized layout.

1644
01:39:34,320 --> 01:39:36,480
There was also a Fire OS version,

1645
01:39:36,480 --> 01:39:40,480
an emulated version of Vice City was playable on PS3.

1646
01:39:41,440 --> 01:39:44,920
That was with the PlayStation Network's PS2 Classics.

1647
01:39:45,200 --> 01:39:48,880
Another emulated version for PS4 upscaled to 1080p

1648
01:39:49,120 --> 01:39:50,480
with PlayStation Trophies.

1649
01:39:52,600 --> 01:39:57,600
There is a remastered version called the Definitive Edition

1650
01:39:58,760 --> 01:40:03,120
that was released on Windows, Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox One,

1651
01:40:03,120 --> 01:40:09,560
Xbox Series X slash S, more versions for Android and iOS in development.

1652
01:40:12,040 --> 01:40:14,960
Another group reverse engineered the game

1653
01:40:14,960 --> 01:40:17,960
and released it as an executable in 2020.

1654
01:40:19,240 --> 01:40:25,400
It was called ReVC that lets you put it on Switch, Vita, Wii U.

1655
01:40:26,240 --> 01:40:30,520
Take-Two issued a DMCA takedown on the project.

1656
01:40:32,800 --> 01:40:36,880
But there's a lot more about just where it stands in legalities.

1657
01:40:36,880 --> 01:40:40,320
You know, there are people then trying to reverse engineer it

1658
01:40:40,320 --> 01:40:44,080
and put it everywhere and Take-Two is like, oh, no, no, no.

1659
01:40:45,440 --> 01:40:47,120
Bad people, no.

1660
01:40:47,120 --> 01:40:48,080
But that's it.

1661
01:40:48,080 --> 01:40:51,600
I know there's a lot to cover on that one and I glossed over a bunch.

1662
01:40:53,800 --> 01:40:57,240
If you're interested, though, there there's a really good

1663
01:40:57,240 --> 01:40:58,400
I'd have to find it again.

1664
01:40:58,400 --> 01:41:01,920
There's a really good documentary about the entire evolution

1665
01:41:01,920 --> 01:41:06,760
of the Grand Theft Auto series down to every new version

1666
01:41:06,760 --> 01:41:09,400
in the platform that it was on.

1667
01:41:09,400 --> 01:41:13,720
And I highly recommend watching it if you're really interested in it.

1668
01:41:14,400 --> 01:41:19,600
Um, Boz, there was no code for hot coffee and it wasn't even in this game,

1669
01:41:19,600 --> 01:41:22,320
which is why I didn't do the game that the hot coffee was in.

1670
01:41:25,240 --> 01:41:28,880
Because as part of this, which a great pick for Classic Game of the Week,

1671
01:41:28,880 --> 01:41:31,280
obviously had to be done eventually,

1672
01:41:31,280 --> 01:41:34,280
because it got brought up, I also was legitimately curious

1673
01:41:34,280 --> 01:41:35,880
whatever happened to that bitch.

1674
01:41:35,880 --> 01:41:41,440
So I went to the wiki for Jack Thompson to see whatever happened to that bitch.

1675
01:41:41,720 --> 01:41:43,200
And yes, you all are right.

1676
01:41:43,200 --> 01:41:44,040
He was disbarred.

1677
01:41:44,040 --> 01:41:45,920
We, you know, we covered that a million times over.

1678
01:41:46,160 --> 01:41:50,200
It's interesting because the it talks about his activities through about 2008,

1679
01:41:50,200 --> 01:41:53,920
2009, and then there's nothing but a single sentence.

1680
01:41:53,920 --> 01:41:59,280
And again, this is it's sourced, but it's yeah, it's sourced, but it's it's wiki.

1681
01:41:59,280 --> 01:42:01,120
So, you know, whatever anybody could have written it.

1682
01:42:01,400 --> 01:42:08,360
But in an April 2016 interview with Inverse, which is an online magazine,

1683
01:42:08,880 --> 01:42:14,600
Thompson stated he was teaching civics classes to inmates in the Florida prison system,

1684
01:42:14,880 --> 01:42:18,320
including an American history and constitutional law class

1685
01:42:18,320 --> 01:42:20,600
at the Everglades Correctional Institution.

1686
01:42:22,520 --> 01:42:23,080
So.

1687
01:42:24,160 --> 01:42:25,800
As a fellow inmate or?

1688
01:42:25,800 --> 01:42:26,960
No, no.

1689
01:42:27,520 --> 01:42:28,040
Oh.

1690
01:42:29,560 --> 01:42:31,240
So, oh, God.

1691
01:42:31,240 --> 01:42:33,440
Did you see the section about Janet Reno?

1692
01:42:33,440 --> 01:42:34,280
No, I didn't.

1693
01:42:34,280 --> 01:42:36,440
I didn't want to read everything.

1694
01:42:36,440 --> 01:42:37,160
I have to.

1695
01:42:37,200 --> 01:42:38,200
This is great.

1696
01:42:38,240 --> 01:42:38,640
OK.

1697
01:42:39,880 --> 01:42:44,680
He met Janet Reno in 1975, applied for a job, but was not hired.

1698
01:42:45,200 --> 01:42:45,760
He.

1699
01:42:48,160 --> 01:42:49,240
He had.

1700
01:42:50,720 --> 01:42:55,720
Sent her a letter to have her check a box to indicate whether she was homosexual,

1701
01:42:55,720 --> 01:43:00,040
bisexual or heterosexual, and then she put a hand on his shoulder and responded,

1702
01:43:00,280 --> 01:43:02,040
I'm only interested in virile men.

1703
01:43:02,040 --> 01:43:03,320
That's why I'm not attracted to you.

1704
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:07,840
I miss Janet Reno.

1705
01:43:08,040 --> 01:43:12,000
Like the thing the thing I miss about Janet Reno most was that when Will Ferrer

1706
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:14,720
would parody her on Saturday Night Live with the dance parties,

1707
01:43:14,720 --> 01:43:18,640
not only was that whole thing really funny, but she came on and did one.

1708
01:43:18,840 --> 01:43:21,080
And they had a laugh together.

1709
01:43:21,080 --> 01:43:23,640
Like she was very like self-deprecating in that way.

1710
01:43:23,640 --> 01:43:25,200
And, you know, that's it's great.

1711
01:43:25,880 --> 01:43:32,280
And for anyone who only knows him about this, he was also the one responsible

1712
01:43:32,280 --> 01:43:40,240
for the lawsuit against NWA, 2 Live Crew, all of that going on.

1713
01:43:40,840 --> 01:43:42,760
Oh, that's how he got famous.

1714
01:43:42,760 --> 01:43:44,480
I'm using my quotey fingers in the first place.

1715
01:43:44,720 --> 01:43:46,520
He went around a bunch of rap.

1716
01:43:46,520 --> 01:43:48,040
He went after a bunch of rap groups.

1717
01:43:48,600 --> 01:43:54,440
He went after Ice-T for for that rather famous song of his and Madonna.

1718
01:43:55,840 --> 01:43:57,120
So, yeah, whatever.

1719
01:43:57,120 --> 01:43:57,720
Anyway.

1720
01:43:57,720 --> 01:43:58,200
All right.

1721
01:43:58,680 --> 01:43:59,040
All right.

1722
01:43:59,040 --> 01:44:01,640
Well, there's your update on that one.

1723
01:44:01,760 --> 01:44:02,200
All right.

1724
01:44:02,200 --> 01:44:02,800
Moving on.

1725
01:44:02,800 --> 01:44:06,960
Let's talk of the sickest of sick burns from Janet Reno.

1726
01:44:06,960 --> 01:44:09,840
Let us not speak of his name again for another seven years.

1727
01:44:09,840 --> 01:44:10,240
All right.

1728
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:11,640
Moving on.

1729
01:44:11,640 --> 01:44:15,560
Let's talk about some other things going on in the gaming industry, but we can do it quickly.

1730
01:44:15,560 --> 01:44:16,840
Loki, rapid fire news.

1731
01:44:17,480 --> 01:44:21,760
Yeah, as we talked about last week, there was a game that leaked out and now there's the official announcement.

1732
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:24,160
So it's Lego 2K Drive.

1733
01:44:24,160 --> 01:44:26,320
It is an open world racing game.

1734
01:44:26,320 --> 01:44:29,880
Kind of think of almost for maybe a little bit of Forza, but obviously not.

1735
01:44:30,840 --> 01:44:34,720
But it is a Lego game and you drive and race around.

1736
01:44:35,640 --> 01:44:38,000
Unfortunately, it is a 2K game.

1737
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:41,120
And with that, there are season passes.

1738
01:44:41,120 --> 01:44:43,880
There are in-game currencies.

1739
01:44:43,880 --> 01:44:51,120
There are monetization's and there are seventy dollar price tags, assuming you buy the base game.

1740
01:44:51,120 --> 01:44:57,560
In which case, then also it could be upwards to ninety nine or even more than that for the game.

1741
01:44:57,560 --> 01:45:03,200
So. That's probably a pass for me, even though it does look cool, but like.

1742
01:45:04,400 --> 01:45:05,800
No, no.

1743
01:45:08,160 --> 01:45:13,480
And then, of course, you know, continuing on with their cereal domination,

1744
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:17,560
Minecraft is doing yet another cereal this time.

1745
01:45:17,560 --> 01:45:21,440
They are doing Minecraft flavored Frosted Flakes, I guess.

1746
01:45:21,440 --> 01:45:24,640
It basically has marshmallows in it and their square marshmallows.

1747
01:45:25,360 --> 01:45:29,600
It's better than their first cereal to ruin cereals by putting in gross marshmallows.

1748
01:45:29,960 --> 01:45:36,080
I mean, yeah, well, they're their original Minecraft cereal that they have and my kids have had.

1749
01:45:36,320 --> 01:45:43,280
It was like cinnamon cereal, but like not cinnamon sugar is like cinnamon with marshmallows.

1750
01:45:43,680 --> 01:45:47,600
So I'll take Frosted Flakes with marshmallows over cinnamon with marshmallows.

1751
01:45:47,600 --> 01:45:50,320
I don't know why they keep doing cinnamon, like stop doing cinnamon.

1752
01:45:50,320 --> 01:45:54,800
I also cannot stand the concept of marshmallows and cereal because I don't.

1753
01:45:54,800 --> 01:45:57,560
OK, because I'm the weirdo. I don't like my cereal and milk.

1754
01:45:57,560 --> 01:45:59,240
I like to just eat cereal.

1755
01:45:59,240 --> 01:46:05,040
But the marshmallows that they put in cereal is meant to be put in milk to actually become full marshmallow.

1756
01:46:05,880 --> 01:46:07,440
But there's gross anyway.

1757
01:46:07,440 --> 01:46:09,880
Marshmallows are gross, but these are the gross of the gross.

1758
01:46:09,880 --> 01:46:11,880
Yeah, but the licorice of marshmallows.

1759
01:46:11,880 --> 01:46:13,680
I love the dehydrated marshmallows.

1760
01:46:13,680 --> 01:46:16,800
I love I love Lucky Charms because like you chew into the marshmallow.

1761
01:46:16,800 --> 01:46:18,760
It's kind of like chewing on an eraser.

1762
01:46:18,760 --> 01:46:20,200
It's just great. I love it.

1763
01:46:21,200 --> 01:46:26,280
I could. And now keep in mind, I was I was the kid that liked Grape Nuts.

1764
01:46:27,040 --> 01:46:30,360
Yeah, I'm like, I like Frosted Mini Wheats.

1765
01:46:30,360 --> 01:46:32,720
That's that's my favorite.

1766
01:46:32,720 --> 01:46:33,880
You know what? You know what?

1767
01:46:33,880 --> 01:46:38,760
My cereal, so like I'm on both sides of the spectrum with cereals there.

1768
01:46:38,760 --> 01:46:44,040
So like it's either like Captain Crunch or Total.

1769
01:46:44,880 --> 01:46:45,720
I love Total.

1770
01:46:45,720 --> 01:46:46,680
See, here's the thing.

1771
01:46:46,680 --> 01:46:50,720
A diabetes diagnosis will change your perspective on cereal significantly.

1772
01:46:50,720 --> 01:46:53,560
I don't I can't there's an interesting brand.

1773
01:46:53,560 --> 01:46:57,240
I'm not going to name it because they pay a lot of money for advertising on social media.

1774
01:46:57,240 --> 01:47:03,680
But there's there is a brand that is trying to make low carb cereal and they actually sell it at Target now.

1775
01:47:03,680 --> 01:47:06,120
And I've had it and it's it's OK.

1776
01:47:06,960 --> 01:47:08,600
But it's all about portion.

1777
01:47:08,600 --> 01:47:09,360
You haven't heard of it?

1778
01:47:09,920 --> 01:47:11,240
No, I'll text you.

1779
01:47:11,760 --> 01:47:13,320
I have Turbo. I don't watch ads.

1780
01:47:13,720 --> 01:47:17,440
Oh, no, no, it's it's oh, you don't you don't read Facebook, it's Facebook ads.

1781
01:47:17,680 --> 01:47:22,760
So Facebook, Facebook, I've completely divorced myself from the entire Facebook universe.

1782
01:47:23,920 --> 01:47:27,240
Jealous, but it's easy.

1783
01:47:27,240 --> 01:47:29,080
Just don't do it. Yeah.

1784
01:47:29,080 --> 01:47:32,040
So but yeah.

1785
01:47:32,360 --> 01:47:34,560
So there's there's a very popular brand.

1786
01:47:34,840 --> 01:47:36,800
Yes. Deft said it in chat.

1787
01:47:36,800 --> 01:47:40,120
That's as much as I'll give you for the podcast for the podcast.

1788
01:47:40,360 --> 01:47:43,080
All right. But it's it's OK.

1789
01:47:43,360 --> 01:47:50,240
But you can kind of tell that you're eating something that's like, I can't believe it's not cereal.

1790
01:47:50,600 --> 01:47:55,400
Like it's like it's very it's it's the margarine of cereals.

1791
01:47:55,600 --> 01:47:56,400
It really is.

1792
01:47:57,080 --> 01:47:57,440
All right.

1793
01:47:57,440 --> 01:48:03,200
And Bobby, just just as an FYI, the rest of my family is on Facebook.

1794
01:48:03,320 --> 01:48:04,840
I'm still not going on there.

1795
01:48:04,840 --> 01:48:06,680
If they want to talk to me, they can message me.

1796
01:48:09,080 --> 01:48:10,680
Family, who talks to them?

1797
01:48:10,720 --> 01:48:11,760
All right. I'm just kidding.

1798
01:48:12,280 --> 01:48:13,880
I talk to my dad as much as I can.

1799
01:48:14,360 --> 01:48:19,960
All right. Moving on, let's move on and oh, we still have actually I'm sorry, some stories here.

1800
01:48:19,960 --> 01:48:21,160
Let's go to Dark Sakura.

1801
01:48:21,160 --> 01:48:22,880
Oh, this is another interesting collaboration.

1802
01:48:22,880 --> 01:48:24,560
I love this. Yeah.

1803
01:48:24,560 --> 01:48:32,240
And I kind of don't know what to think, except I need to just like go buy a bunch of this and then have a place that has an accessible bathtub.

1804
01:48:33,800 --> 01:48:35,880
But they are selling.

1805
01:48:36,120 --> 01:48:40,520
Lush has a collaboration with the Super Mario Brothers movie.

1806
01:48:40,920 --> 01:48:48,320
And they have a series of bath soaps to, quote, power up your bathing.

1807
01:48:48,920 --> 01:48:59,240
There's a cola scented Mario shower gel, apple for Luigi, a warm and spicy Bowser shower jelly and a peach shower jelly.

1808
01:49:00,160 --> 01:49:02,000
So, yay.

1809
01:49:03,120 --> 01:49:06,600
But the thing that I care about is the question block bath bomb.

1810
01:49:06,880 --> 01:49:10,720
And I am going to quote the article here because they did miss a freaking opportunity.

1811
01:49:10,960 --> 01:49:12,640
They should have called it a bath bomb.

1812
01:49:14,480 --> 01:49:17,480
Oh, they should have called it a bath bomb, I love that.

1813
01:49:19,160 --> 01:49:32,800
But at any rate, you drop the question block into your bath and you get a super power toy, a coin, you get a fire flower or, you know, a star or, you know, one up or something.

1814
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:40,640
And like, I'm not going to lie, I got some of the Hello Kitty ones for the same thing.

1815
01:49:41,760 --> 01:49:44,120
So I would do this.

1816
01:49:45,840 --> 01:49:47,280
It just depends on what it smells like.

1817
01:49:47,320 --> 01:49:52,240
I am like ridiculously sensitive to some smells.

1818
01:49:52,440 --> 01:50:00,680
I like Lush, but I get like, I kind of feel high when I'm in there too long, like overstimulated.

1819
01:50:00,680 --> 01:50:02,560
It is an overpowering, yeah.

1820
01:50:03,360 --> 01:50:10,640
And also, I still have the same chocolate lotion bar that I bought five years ago.

1821
01:50:12,080 --> 01:50:14,480
I've almost used it up, but I still have it.

1822
01:50:17,280 --> 01:50:21,920
I actually, it's one of those things where it's like, I love me a bubble bath.

1823
01:50:21,920 --> 01:50:26,840
I do, especially now that Alan and I have a house with a tub that lends itself to being able to do that.

1824
01:50:26,840 --> 01:50:29,480
Like, I'm going to have to go to Lush.

1825
01:50:29,480 --> 01:50:41,000
And that's one of those places where you walk in there and those hounds that work there will upsell you, upsell you.

1826
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:43,720
They're so, so good at that stuff.

1827
01:50:43,760 --> 01:50:48,800
Like, I'll go into Lush and like $100 later, I'll be like, why did I buy all this shit?

1828
01:50:49,440 --> 01:50:51,880
But anyway, but I do love me a bubble bath.

1829
01:50:52,320 --> 01:50:55,880
So, all right, moving on.

1830
01:50:56,320 --> 01:50:57,440
Let's talk about...

1831
01:50:58,440 --> 01:51:00,280
Body washes soap.

1832
01:51:02,520 --> 01:51:02,840
Yeah.

1833
01:51:02,840 --> 01:51:04,200
Just saying it's for a tiger claw.

1834
01:51:04,520 --> 01:51:05,120
It doesn't.

1835
01:51:05,520 --> 01:51:05,920
Yeah.

1836
01:51:06,600 --> 01:51:09,440
I don't even know, what did Lush pull on YouTube?

1837
01:51:09,440 --> 01:51:10,400
I didn't know about a thing like that.

1838
01:51:10,400 --> 01:51:12,760
I didn't know about something that they did on YouTube.

1839
01:51:12,760 --> 01:51:13,440
So...

1840
01:51:13,680 --> 01:51:16,560
Well, let me read this while I wait for elaboration on that.

1841
01:51:17,080 --> 01:51:20,400
Let's talk about the Bloodstained Curse of the Moon Chronicles.

1842
01:51:20,400 --> 01:51:23,480
There is a physical switch bundle that is being announced for Japan.

1843
01:51:23,720 --> 01:51:28,920
And that is going to come out with an art book, a two-disc soundtrack CD and an acrylic keychain.

1844
01:51:29,200 --> 01:51:33,040
It's being released on July 13th for 4180.

1845
01:51:33,040 --> 01:51:36,880
I'm sorry, the regular edition is 4180 yen.

1846
01:51:37,080 --> 01:51:42,360
The premium limited edition, 9980 yen for that.

1847
01:51:42,360 --> 01:51:48,040
And again, this is for Bloodstained Curse of the Moon, which basically if you're a Castlevania fan, this is all you have now.

1848
01:51:48,560 --> 01:51:51,520
So, some people may be interested in that.

1849
01:51:52,520 --> 01:51:59,280
All righty, Fixation Gay says, Lush bought a URL that a small creator was using and YouTube basically let them steal it.

1850
01:51:59,280 --> 01:52:06,640
Oh, you know, we had brought up that site Kick earlier, and I heard a similar thing happened over there, which is not a good look for them.

1851
01:52:06,640 --> 01:52:10,800
And that was actually the whole thing that made me go think, oh, I should go state claim to my name over there now.

1852
01:52:11,040 --> 01:52:13,280
Not that it's going to matter, but I don't think there's a...

1853
01:52:13,280 --> 01:52:16,720
Why do you think I have never let go of DarkSakurai.com?

1854
01:52:16,720 --> 01:52:17,520
Oh, I don't believe you.

1855
01:52:17,920 --> 01:52:26,080
I don't think there's a lot of people using the name Rob Roberts, but I know there's a politician in the UK who is apparently an arsehole, from what I understand.

1856
01:52:27,360 --> 01:52:29,640
But I don't know much about him.

1857
01:52:29,640 --> 01:52:32,200
But apparently there's a politician over there who's got a lot of troubles.

1858
01:52:32,680 --> 01:52:34,520
I share my stage name with a porn star.

1859
01:52:35,800 --> 01:52:38,360
Well, and the Bionic Woman, for God's sake.

1860
01:52:38,360 --> 01:52:42,160
No, no, no, I spell mine differently than the Bionic Woman, remember?

1861
01:52:42,160 --> 01:52:44,840
No, OK. Oh, you mean down to the spelling.

1862
01:52:45,240 --> 01:52:55,400
Yeah, down to the spelling, because because the Bionic Woman is J-A-I-M-E-S-O-M-M-E-R-S and mine is J-A-M-I-E.

1863
01:52:55,640 --> 01:52:57,800
I get pissed off when people misspell my name out here.

1864
01:52:57,800 --> 01:53:04,680
I'm looking at you, everybody ever at Starbucks and S-U-M-M-E-R-S.

1865
01:53:04,760 --> 01:53:06,280
So, so, yeah.

1866
01:53:06,760 --> 01:53:12,120
Um. Although, Rob, you remember this, Jessica's ex.

1867
01:53:13,280 --> 01:53:19,560
Yeah, and I had the same name down to last name, and we got each other's mail

1868
01:53:20,640 --> 01:53:27,840
and I still got his mail years after they were they were broken up until I got married.

1869
01:53:27,880 --> 01:53:33,360
Yeah. I'm not saying what my old name was.

1870
01:53:33,360 --> 01:53:36,440
Of course not. The concept of a maiden name is disgusting.

1871
01:53:37,920 --> 01:53:45,360
All right. Let's move on and try to check out some releases, things that will be coming out a little sooner than the Curse of the Moon Chronicles bundle.

1872
01:53:45,880 --> 01:53:48,480
World release date starting in the U.S., Loki.

1873
01:53:49,320 --> 01:53:56,000
Yeah, we have Nine Years of Shadows on PC and Crime Boss, Rock K.

1874
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:57,120
City. That's awesome.

1875
01:53:57,120 --> 01:54:00,520
Can't wait to play that. That'll be coming out this week as well.

1876
01:54:00,840 --> 01:54:10,360
Last of Us Part One on PC, MLB The Show 23 on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series.

1877
01:54:10,880 --> 01:54:13,640
Sifu on Xbox One and Xbox Series.

1878
01:54:14,040 --> 01:54:19,880
Dredge on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series.

1879
01:54:20,400 --> 01:54:23,200
The Great War Western Front on PC.

1880
01:54:23,680 --> 01:54:31,440
Raven Bound on PC, Saga of Sins on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series.

1881
01:54:31,880 --> 01:54:38,080
Blade Assault on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series.

1882
01:54:38,120 --> 01:54:38,680
That is it.

1883
01:54:39,840 --> 01:54:50,640
All right. Going over to Japan on the 30th of March on the Nintendo Switch, we have Serial Cleaners is coming out.

1884
01:54:51,400 --> 01:54:52,960
Is this a game? What I think it is.

1885
01:54:52,960 --> 01:55:04,040
Oh, no, I literally thought this is going to be a game about cleaning, like Powerwash Simulator, but like next level, like for people who just can't get enough, never be clean.

1886
01:55:04,320 --> 01:55:05,360
I thought it would be that.

1887
01:55:05,360 --> 01:55:06,960
Speaking of Serial Mom.

1888
01:55:06,960 --> 01:55:09,240
No, sadly, it is nothing like that.

1889
01:55:09,240 --> 01:55:19,680
It is about, it says straight out of 90s, but it's getting rid of bodies, making the place spotless and don't get caught.

1890
01:55:19,920 --> 01:55:28,240
You alternate between four characters with a unique skill set, and it's set in the era of 90s cult movies.

1891
01:55:28,280 --> 01:55:29,560
So I guess that is interesting.

1892
01:55:29,560 --> 01:55:32,000
You're cleaning up crime scenes.

1893
01:55:32,280 --> 01:55:35,200
I guess that is kind of an interesting concept for a game.

1894
01:55:35,200 --> 01:55:37,080
So that is out on the Switch this week.

1895
01:55:37,640 --> 01:55:40,400
Also, Tales of the Neon Sea also out this week.

1896
01:55:40,600 --> 01:55:42,160
Winning post 10.

1897
01:55:42,720 --> 01:55:44,720
That's right. Winning post series.

1898
01:55:44,720 --> 01:55:45,600
It's still going.

1899
01:55:45,600 --> 01:55:48,560
And Koei Tecmo is putting out the 10th version in Japan this week.

1900
01:55:49,560 --> 01:55:51,160
That is all on the Switch.

1901
01:55:51,440 --> 01:56:00,880
Also in Japan on the PlayStation 5 this week, The Chant, as well as Tales of the Neon Sea, winning post 10, not skipping the PlayStation.

1902
01:56:00,880 --> 01:56:02,560
So it's out there as well.

1903
01:56:03,280 --> 01:56:04,960
Let's move over to the UK.

1904
01:56:04,960 --> 01:56:05,560
Dark Sakura.

1905
01:56:06,400 --> 01:56:07,360
Bare handful.

1906
01:56:07,760 --> 01:56:12,240
On the 28th on Switch, we have Session Skatesim.

1907
01:56:13,280 --> 01:56:15,280
Also, actually, all of these are on the 30th.

1908
01:56:15,280 --> 01:56:17,560
Also on Switch, we have Ravensburger Memory.

1909
01:56:19,120 --> 01:56:25,320
Dredge for PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch, not to be confused with The Dredge, most annoying killer ever.

1910
01:56:25,320 --> 01:56:26,000
Well, one of them.

1911
01:56:26,440 --> 01:56:32,320
And then also on the 30th, we have Sifu, Vengeance Edition for Xbox.

1912
01:56:34,480 --> 01:56:41,560
All right, we have a few more stories for you, and then we have the mailbag as well as your calls, if we have any tonight.

1913
01:56:42,560 --> 01:56:43,840
vognetwork.com.

1914
01:56:43,840 --> 01:56:48,160
That's vognetwork.com slash Discord is how to join our Discord server.

1915
01:56:48,960 --> 01:56:49,720
Let's move on.

1916
01:56:49,720 --> 01:56:51,080
We have some more stories.

1917
01:56:51,080 --> 01:56:52,720
So let's go over to Loki.

1918
01:56:53,800 --> 01:56:55,720
Oh, yes, I'm so excited.

1919
01:56:55,760 --> 01:57:01,200
The news that Ubisoft is going to use AI to help them write dialogue.

1920
01:57:01,600 --> 01:57:02,520
That's great.

1921
01:57:03,360 --> 01:57:04,600
We know how that goes.

1922
01:57:04,640 --> 01:57:10,840
Can the AI help them write, make better games that aren't all derivative of the Far Cry?

1923
01:57:11,320 --> 01:57:14,480
The AI can run companies more effectively, it turns out.

1924
01:57:17,200 --> 01:57:19,280
They've developed a tool called Ghostwriter.

1925
01:57:19,320 --> 01:57:34,440
It says, introducing Ubisoft Ghostwriter, an AI tool developed in-house that aims to support our scriptwriters by generating the first draft of our NPC barks and phrases or sounds made by NPCs when players interact with them in the game world.

1926
01:57:34,920 --> 01:57:43,360
It says the tool was created hand in hand with scriptwriters to create more realistic NPC interactions by generating variations on pieces of dialogue.

1927
01:57:43,920 --> 01:57:49,640
And yeah, neat, I guess.

1928
01:57:53,920 --> 01:57:55,080
I don't know, like,

1929
01:57:55,080 --> 01:58:13,960
Ubisoft of all companies, you know, really hearing that some of the work is being tasked to AI, like, I just, I feel that like, their games already feel like they're generated by AI, like, let alone, you know, actually using AI for stuff.

1930
01:58:13,960 --> 01:58:21,000
I understand that this is kind of, you know, to save some time, but not a great look.

1931
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:31,240
Can the AI solve the problem of, you know, the rampant sexual harassment that's going on in the company? Can Ghostwriter take care of that too?

1932
01:58:32,600 --> 01:58:40,040
As I said earlier in the show, the AI can make a better CEO for the company than Bobby Kotick.

1933
01:58:41,040 --> 01:58:47,520
Let me actually so while you were saying that I actually just threw this into the Google bard thingy thing.

1934
01:58:47,520 --> 01:58:55,600
So let me show that and by the way, why is it now? It didn't used to do this. But when I try to set up b roll on my other monitor, it makes your guys's squares gray.

1935
01:58:55,600 --> 01:59:03,920
It didn't used to do that. I have to figure out what's going on behind the scenes. So sorry about that. But I just said I said, Okay, make up a new killer for the game Dead by Daylight.

1936
01:59:04,400 --> 01:59:13,000
And it says, here's a new killer that I'm not going to read the whole thing, but it came up with a killer called the puppeteer. The puppeteer can control the movements of other survivors by using a special puppet.

1937
01:59:13,200 --> 01:59:19,480
The puppet can be used to attack survivors, block them from escape routes, or even force them to self sabotage. Okay, this all sounds fine and good.

1938
01:59:19,520 --> 01:59:22,120
The what? The bellmaster from VHS?

1939
01:59:22,120 --> 01:59:35,280
This clearly was stolen from a fan thing or another game even like you're suggesting from somewhere. Right? That's that's the whole thing where like this-

1940
01:59:35,280 --> 01:59:36,920
Orange, right, we already have the pig.

1941
01:59:37,400 --> 01:59:47,120
This AI thing is kind of going, right? And fixation gaze says, yeah, that's someone's idea, right? And and I realized the usage of the term AI is a little bit nuanced.

1942
01:59:47,120 --> 02:00:02,880
I'm using that here because that is what the industry and most, you know, commentators are saying right now. I realize, you know, some may say this is like machine learning, or this is just this is just really let me Google that for you to the next level because it's using a lot of predictive stuff to do this.

1943
02:00:03,080 --> 02:00:11,440
But my point is, a lot of what just came up in that little thing about make up a new killer that was stolen from somewhere. I guarantee it.

1944
02:00:11,440 --> 02:00:19,560
Yeah, from Reddit, because I just searched Dead by Daylight Puppeteer. And there's someone that there in this big old thing.

1945
02:00:19,560 --> 02:00:27,600
An AI cannot create its own answer without having learned it from other sources. That is the essence of machine learning.

1946
02:00:28,040 --> 02:00:29,360
Exactly, exactly.

1947
02:00:29,960 --> 02:00:36,520
So, I'll, yeah, I mean, I've taken a few courses on machine learning lately.

1948
02:00:37,640 --> 02:00:47,520
The, for anyone who's saying, oh, it's going to be able to make these logical decisions and everything, all of its decisions are going to be based by the input of whatever goes into its database.

1949
02:00:49,280 --> 02:00:51,800
I mean, some of the stuff that they've seen, and not necessarily-

1950
02:00:51,800 --> 02:00:53,320
This isn't Detroit, y'all.

1951
02:00:53,640 --> 02:01:06,480
But like GPT-4, whatever, they've been doing a hustle GPT, where they basically feed in like, okay, hey, you have $100 to spend, you know, we're going to start a business that's going to make as much money as possible.

1952
02:01:06,520 --> 02:01:13,200
You tell me what to do, and I'll do it. And then it'll basically walk you through the whole process of doing everything.

1953
02:01:16,360 --> 02:01:17,040
I'm going to see-

1954
02:01:17,160 --> 02:01:18,600
Actually making money with it, too.

1955
02:01:19,560 --> 02:01:24,200
I did this earlier and I got an answer and I have to share it here because you guys will get a kick out of this.

1956
02:01:24,200 --> 02:01:31,280
Okay, here we go. So I asked Bard, what is the longest running video game podcast?

1957
02:01:32,200 --> 02:01:39,640
And it told me the longest running video game podcast is another show, which has been running since 2002.

1958
02:01:39,640 --> 02:01:44,720
It's a weekly radio show that is broadcast live on the internet and is also available as a podcast.

1959
02:01:44,720 --> 02:01:48,400
This particular show also started on the radio somewhere.

1960
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:52,840
And I actually, I'm not sure that's the year they actually started.

1961
02:01:52,840 --> 02:01:54,520
I have to go look it up or whatever.

1962
02:01:54,760 --> 02:01:59,840
But if you didn't know, this show has been running since June 23rd, 2002.

1963
02:01:59,840 --> 02:02:05,600
And we're pretty confident we're the longest running video game podcast, weekly, uninterrupted at this point.

1964
02:02:06,440 --> 02:02:11,960
So, and I like if this had come up and said gamer tag radio-

1965
02:02:11,960 --> 02:02:12,760
Except for Star Trek Cruises?

1966
02:02:13,040 --> 02:02:13,560
What's that?

1967
02:02:14,080 --> 02:02:14,760
Except for Star Trek Cruises?

1968
02:02:14,760 --> 02:02:16,120
Well, yeah, uninterrupted.

1969
02:02:16,720 --> 02:02:19,360
Every show gets, people take Christmas and New Year's off.

1970
02:02:19,480 --> 02:02:28,760
Anyway, if this had come up and said gamer tag radio, at least I would have understood that one because, you know, he puts out multiple episodes a week and he crossed 1000 episodes some time ago.

1971
02:02:28,760 --> 02:02:33,120
So I would have at least kind of got like, it's kind of your perception of what is longest to me.

1972
02:02:33,120 --> 02:02:35,200
It started in 2006.

1973
02:02:35,400 --> 02:02:37,360
We are the longest chronologically running.

1974
02:02:37,360 --> 02:02:42,120
So it's not even correct on the year that they started, which no disrespect to this show.

1975
02:02:42,160 --> 02:02:43,320
They work very hard.

1976
02:02:43,320 --> 02:02:45,120
This is not about us versus them.

1977
02:02:45,120 --> 02:02:53,080
This is just about, we're very proud of the long legacy that this show has created and the fact that people still don't know about it.

1978
02:02:53,320 --> 02:02:57,720
And like, you know, we're somehow that cool indie band, 21 years after the fact.

1979
02:02:57,720 --> 02:02:58,960
We're very proud of that.

1980
02:02:58,960 --> 02:03:08,240
And so I just, I get irritated because actually, if you go in and you look at some of the, one of them, like one of the suggestions even said they're the Guinness World Record holder.

1981
02:03:08,400 --> 02:03:10,800
And that's what I went, hold up.

1982
02:03:10,920 --> 02:03:12,840
But I actually couldn't find anything to source that.

1983
02:03:13,160 --> 02:03:14,760
Yeah, Bard made that shit up.

1984
02:03:14,760 --> 02:03:16,120
I tried to apply.

1985
02:03:16,160 --> 02:03:16,640
I do.

1986
02:03:16,640 --> 02:03:17,080
I do.

1987
02:03:17,080 --> 02:03:19,080
That's why I went, hold the fuck up.

1988
02:03:19,120 --> 02:03:20,520
That's exactly why I did that.

1989
02:03:20,760 --> 02:03:21,040
Right.

1990
02:03:21,760 --> 02:03:23,400
We have to apply as a company, by the way.

1991
02:03:23,400 --> 02:03:23,720
Yeah.

1992
02:03:24,360 --> 02:03:30,120
So yeah, if you search for one life left, it says, I was trying to do a call out post Loki.

1993
02:03:31,080 --> 02:03:31,800
I don't care.

1994
02:03:31,800 --> 02:03:32,160
Whatever.

1995
02:03:32,480 --> 02:03:41,360
Uh, even say it's the world's longest, the world's longest running video game podcast, which is false.

1996
02:03:42,240 --> 02:03:44,000
So yeah, it's,

1997
02:03:44,240 --> 02:03:48,480
I want to be, I want to be clear because I don't, I don't want a silly war starting because we're all in it together.

1998
02:03:48,480 --> 02:03:49,520
We're all podcasties.

1999
02:03:49,760 --> 02:03:51,720
This is not an us versus them thing.

2000
02:03:51,720 --> 02:03:59,480
This is just an AI doesn't get the facts right because it can't be nuanced enough sometimes.

2001
02:03:59,960 --> 02:04:01,720
So it's, that's what it is.

2002
02:04:01,760 --> 02:04:13,400
So anyway, but so the whole MPC dialogue and my point I was trying to make was that sure it can, and I realized they're not going to be using literally Google Bard or chat, GBT or whatever, but whatever it is they're using.

2003
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:21,240
You know, I guess if it trains off of Ubisoft games, then whatever, whatever, but it's, it's all going to sound like a copy of something else.

2004
02:04:24,400 --> 02:04:28,000
Now, granted, some of you feel that video game quest text is already at that point.

2005
02:04:28,640 --> 02:04:29,920
Oh, oh, Rob.

2006
02:04:30,160 --> 02:04:30,720
What's that?

2007
02:04:31,520 --> 02:04:37,200
I'm sorry, this, I'm not meaning to set this off, but there's something that went back to a very earlier thing that we talked about.

2008
02:04:37,240 --> 02:04:37,760
Okay.

2009
02:04:38,760 --> 02:04:45,840
Um, on the homepage of Twitch now, I think this is, this is on the German page.

2010
02:04:45,840 --> 02:04:49,360
Anyway, there is a Luna link right at the top of the page.

2011
02:04:50,400 --> 02:05:03,760
They're, they have Luna at the bar on the top, but that's like, like throwing a link is literally the, the most minimal thing they could do.

2012
02:05:04,400 --> 02:05:05,560
You don't even notice it.

2013
02:05:06,480 --> 02:05:06,720
Yeah.

2014
02:05:06,760 --> 02:05:10,080
And actually, yes, that says quite a, quite enough right there.

2015
02:05:10,480 --> 02:05:11,360
You've never noticed it.

2016
02:05:11,360 --> 02:05:12,280
With that I don't go to the homepage.

2017
02:05:12,320 --> 02:05:13,600
I just go to my follower page.

2018
02:05:13,600 --> 02:05:14,080
Fair.

2019
02:05:15,440 --> 02:05:16,000
Interesting.

2020
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:18,920
I do go to the homepage, but then I instantly click things on the left.

2021
02:05:18,960 --> 02:05:21,520
So I guess I never think to go to my followers page directly.

2022
02:05:22,040 --> 02:05:22,560
It's interesting.

2023
02:05:23,040 --> 02:05:23,400
Anyway.

2024
02:05:24,400 --> 02:05:25,560
Uh, all right, let's move on.

2025
02:05:25,560 --> 02:05:26,600
We still have a few more stories.

2026
02:05:26,600 --> 02:05:27,200
Dark Sakura.

2027
02:05:28,280 --> 02:05:31,760
Um, so Silent Hill 2 remake.

2028
02:05:32,640 --> 02:05:35,640
Um, it is near completion according to the Bloober team.

2029
02:05:36,120 --> 02:05:44,520
Um, they don't have a launch date yet, but they are revealing that it will be quote sooner rather than later.

2030
02:05:45,120 --> 02:05:51,840
Um, according to a Polish outlet called Bankier, um, they said the game is technically ready.

2031
02:05:51,880 --> 02:05:55,360
Um, but they're, it's not complete.

2032
02:05:55,880 --> 02:05:57,400
It's close to completion.

2033
02:05:57,440 --> 02:06:03,640
Um, and that the release schedule and promotional marketing is actually going out by Konami themselves.

2034
02:06:04,280 --> 02:06:06,280
Um, so that's out of their hands.

2035
02:06:06,760 --> 02:06:12,480
Um, but yeah, the, um, I'm pretty excited.

2036
02:06:12,480 --> 02:06:17,480
They also are saying that the nurse enemies are now have black stockings.

2037
02:06:18,360 --> 02:06:26,040
And according to, uh, Ito, the art director, um, it, it was because the original nurses exposed too much skin.

2038
02:06:26,720 --> 02:06:26,960
Hmm.

2039
02:06:27,560 --> 02:06:36,360
But, um, a lot of the fans are saying that this goes more with James Sunderland's, uh, psychosexual mental state.

2040
02:06:36,760 --> 02:06:41,640
So, but you can, you can already wishlist it on steam.

2041
02:06:41,640 --> 02:06:42,680
So I think that's pretty cool.

2042
02:06:42,920 --> 02:06:43,280
Yeah.

2043
02:06:43,360 --> 02:06:55,800
I wonder if, um, whatever is coming for E3, which by the way, not to get too much on a tangent, but I'm going to, cause I was ready to come on this show and be like, so Hey folks, we're like less than three months from E3.

2044
02:06:56,040 --> 02:06:58,600
Um, are what the fuck is happening?

2045
02:06:58,800 --> 02:07:05,440
Apparently E3 registration did open up at some point to like me and they are supposedly targeting podcasters.

2046
02:07:05,800 --> 02:07:08,720
I almost wanted to apply just for the lols.

2047
02:07:08,760 --> 02:07:12,800
Like I have no intention on going just because I don't have the time off to do it.

2048
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:14,960
I mean, I do, but I don't.

2049
02:07:15,360 --> 02:07:20,400
Um, so it's, I almost want to apply for those, but, um, if one of you want to apply, go for it.

2050
02:07:20,400 --> 02:07:20,920
I don't care.

2051
02:07:20,920 --> 02:07:21,680
But, uh,

2052
02:07:22,680 --> 02:07:25,520
does that mean I have to do like another writing sample?

2053
02:07:25,520 --> 02:07:27,640
Jamie just said everything with her face.

2054
02:07:27,640 --> 02:07:29,600
No, the application is completely different now.

2055
02:07:29,680 --> 02:07:31,360
So they've, they've changed that.

2056
02:07:31,360 --> 02:07:32,760
So for better or for worse, we'll see.

2057
02:07:32,760 --> 02:07:33,200
When is it again?

2058
02:07:33,840 --> 02:07:34,800
Middle of June.

2059
02:07:36,240 --> 02:07:37,280
I know that's so descriptive.

2060
02:07:37,280 --> 02:07:37,800
I'm sorry.

2061
02:07:37,840 --> 02:07:38,600
Like maybe.

2062
02:07:38,600 --> 02:07:43,160
Well, no, no, because, um, I took the week off for my birthday.

2063
02:07:43,720 --> 02:07:46,560
Um, and then I'm going to TwitchCon.

2064
02:07:46,600 --> 02:07:47,160
So,

2065
02:07:47,320 --> 02:07:47,640
Oh yeah.

2066
02:07:47,640 --> 02:07:50,600
I was just saying, no, your birthday is way too early and TwitchCon is too late.

2067
02:07:50,800 --> 02:07:52,240
It's middle of June somewhere.

2068
02:07:52,440 --> 02:07:53,600
I'm not going to be able to swing it.

2069
02:07:54,080 --> 02:07:58,000
I would have done it just for shits and then going to, and then to go to Disneyland.

2070
02:07:58,120 --> 02:07:58,480
Yeah.

2071
02:07:58,480 --> 02:08:06,280
I got to admit, I'm still, I'm still a little bit tempted, but anyway, long story, but they, I have not seen E3 open up to general public.

2072
02:08:07,560 --> 02:08:14,640
Now, I guess I should go to the website cause I, I don't, I would hate to sit here and, you know, I, if I'm, if I'm going to be critical, I want to be accurate.

2073
02:08:14,640 --> 02:08:15,040
Okay.

2074
02:08:15,440 --> 02:08:22,400
So I guess I could look here live on air, but I don't think the, uh, general registration is still open.

2075
02:08:22,520 --> 02:08:29,000
I think industry and media and that whole thing is open, but not the general population is still not open.

2076
02:08:29,280 --> 02:08:33,880
But folks, it is less than three months from E3.

2077
02:08:34,120 --> 02:08:40,800
If you want to get a flight to Los Angeles, 90 days is the sweet spot to do it.

2078
02:08:40,800 --> 02:08:44,280
There it is.

2079
02:08:44,320 --> 02:08:44,520
Okay.

2080
02:08:44,520 --> 02:08:44,920
Thank you.

2081
02:08:44,960 --> 02:08:45,560
Thank you, Bobby.

2082
02:08:45,560 --> 02:08:46,360
I knew somebody in chat.

2083
02:08:46,520 --> 02:08:47,400
Not open yet.

2084
02:08:47,400 --> 02:08:49,840
Gamer registration page says coming soon.

2085
02:08:51,440 --> 02:08:52,320
Sure.

2086
02:08:53,520 --> 02:08:54,360
Is it though?

2087
02:08:54,360 --> 02:08:55,800
No shit about E3 anymore.

2088
02:08:55,800 --> 02:08:56,840
It is not relevant.

2089
02:08:57,520 --> 02:08:58,000
I know.

2090
02:08:58,440 --> 02:08:59,160
End of story.

2091
02:08:59,200 --> 02:08:59,520
I know.

2092
02:08:59,520 --> 02:09:04,040
But I just, when, when the press release finally comes out that says, oh, we had to cancel E3.

2093
02:09:04,160 --> 02:09:06,280
I just want to be able to say, mm hmm.

2094
02:09:07,520 --> 02:09:10,440
I wouldn't, I would go to see if I can get a Sega t-shirt.

2095
02:09:11,280 --> 02:09:13,720
And then go to Disneyland in my Sega t-shirt.

2096
02:09:13,720 --> 02:09:16,680
I would go to take sad selfies in front of the NFT booths.

2097
02:09:16,720 --> 02:09:17,760
That's what I would go for.

2098
02:09:18,760 --> 02:09:22,320
And, and maybe see what sort of vaporware we're looking at again.

2099
02:09:22,320 --> 02:09:23,360
I remember the Phantom.

2100
02:09:25,160 --> 02:09:25,520
All right.

2101
02:09:25,520 --> 02:09:28,000
You guys in chat are cracking me up.

2102
02:09:28,240 --> 02:09:30,800
SSU100Matt says the ball pit will be fantastic.

2103
02:09:31,040 --> 02:09:32,720
Fire Festival E3.

2104
02:09:34,880 --> 02:09:35,800
Make it deep enough.

2105
02:09:35,800 --> 02:09:38,840
I wonder if I, Rob, I wonder if I would run into Kojima again.

2106
02:09:39,320 --> 02:09:39,800
Like I did.

2107
02:09:39,800 --> 02:09:40,600
Why would he go?

2108
02:09:41,080 --> 02:09:42,040
Why would he go?

2109
02:09:43,720 --> 02:09:44,440
It's a joke.

2110
02:09:44,440 --> 02:09:44,680
It is.

2111
02:09:44,680 --> 02:09:44,920
It is.

2112
02:09:45,080 --> 02:09:48,000
Well, Konami may actually announce whatever June thing there is.

2113
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:54,040
So in all seriousness, Summer Game Fest now, and announcements that come with that.

2114
02:09:54,040 --> 02:09:57,040
Maybe we'll see a Silent Hill 2 thing come out of that.

2115
02:09:57,040 --> 02:09:58,200
That could be very interesting.

2116
02:09:58,440 --> 02:09:58,760
So.

2117
02:09:58,800 --> 02:10:08,600
My three happy E3 memories ever was getting to chat through an interpreter with Koji Kondo and getting his autograph.

2118
02:10:09,560 --> 02:10:15,240
And partially getting to meet Akira Yamaoka.

2119
02:10:16,200 --> 02:10:22,360
And getting my picture taken with Igarashi and making him jump out of his skin when I asked him in Japanese, if I could.

2120
02:10:24,280 --> 02:10:25,080
You were there for that.

2121
02:10:25,080 --> 02:10:25,640
I was.

2122
02:10:25,640 --> 02:10:26,120
I was.

2123
02:10:26,120 --> 02:10:26,840
You took the picture.

2124
02:10:26,840 --> 02:10:27,200
I did.

2125
02:10:27,640 --> 02:10:28,040
Yeah.

2126
02:10:28,680 --> 02:10:29,920
Notice I wasn't in the picture.

2127
02:10:29,920 --> 02:10:30,320
I just didn't know.

2128
02:10:30,320 --> 02:10:31,320
With his hat.

2129
02:10:31,880 --> 02:10:32,760
That hat.

2130
02:10:33,600 --> 02:10:36,120
Meeting Igarashi was, was pretty cool.

2131
02:10:36,120 --> 02:10:36,840
He's a rock star.

2132
02:10:36,840 --> 02:10:37,120
Yeah.

2133
02:10:37,760 --> 02:10:38,640
All right, moving on.

2134
02:10:38,640 --> 02:10:40,880
Just a couple more stories and then we can wrap up.

2135
02:10:40,880 --> 02:10:41,520
So, Loki.

2136
02:10:42,800 --> 02:10:43,200
All right.

2137
02:10:43,920 --> 02:10:45,840
So I think we talked about this before.

2138
02:10:45,840 --> 02:10:53,280
The Unreal editor that's coming out for Fortnite that basically allows you to kind of make your own games and stuff out of it.

2139
02:10:53,600 --> 02:10:54,480
It's kind of like.

2140
02:10:55,200 --> 02:10:56,000
That was last week.

2141
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:56,560
Yeah.

2142
02:10:56,560 --> 02:10:56,880
Yeah.

2143
02:10:56,880 --> 02:10:59,920
It's, it's kind of like Roblox, but not like Roblox.

2144
02:10:59,920 --> 02:11:02,720
It's more like, almost like Dreams a little bit.

2145
02:11:03,280 --> 02:11:07,920
But, um, people have already been making things out of it and it looks pretty fantastic.

2146
02:11:07,920 --> 02:11:13,920
And we have things, of course, recreating other games is something that has been a common theme.

2147
02:11:13,920 --> 02:11:21,840
So we have, uh, no World 1-1, but, you know, uh, Grove Street from Grand Theft Auto 5.

2148
02:11:21,840 --> 02:11:31,920
Um, you have people recreating Counter-Strike levels, Mario Kart tracks, um, the, uh, castle from, uh, Super Mario 64.

2149
02:11:31,920 --> 02:11:33,200
That type of stuff.

2150
02:11:33,200 --> 02:11:39,680
And even folks have brought in, um, the original map from Fortnite into Fortnite.

2151
02:11:41,120 --> 02:11:43,200
And you can actually play it too, which is pretty cool.

2152
02:11:43,760 --> 02:11:50,560
So yeah, I'm very excited to see what they do with this, but I'm not sure how the games are going to be presented in there.

2153
02:11:50,560 --> 02:11:53,680
How you can actually play all this stuff, but it sounds cool.

2154
02:11:54,720 --> 02:11:54,960
Yeah.

2155
02:11:56,000 --> 02:12:01,840
Uh, I, it's only been a week and I, but what cracked me up most about that story was somebody put the original Fortnite.

2156
02:12:01,920 --> 02:12:04,080
Fortnite map back in Fortnite, because of course they did.

2157
02:12:06,240 --> 02:12:07,120
I like the original.

2158
02:12:07,680 --> 02:12:12,080
Fortnite can't get away with changing those, but they will, of course, but it's just funny.

2159
02:12:12,080 --> 02:12:17,360
People are always going to miss the old shit and they'll, now they can use this to put it right back in there, which is funnier, funnier.

2160
02:12:17,360 --> 02:12:18,800
So, all right.

2161
02:12:19,760 --> 02:12:26,400
And lastly, tonight we have news on the next game from the creators of Genshin Impact, which is a game I tried to get into.

2162
02:12:26,400 --> 02:12:27,680
It didn't really land for me.

2163
02:12:28,320 --> 02:12:29,600
Maybe this one will, I don't know.

2164
02:12:29,600 --> 02:12:32,160
But it's a game called Honkai Star Rail.

2165
02:12:32,160 --> 02:12:34,160
It's going to be coming out on PC and mobile.

2166
02:12:34,160 --> 02:12:37,760
And they say a PlayStation version will be coming later for five and four.

2167
02:12:38,400 --> 02:12:51,520
This is now a space fantasy tactical RPG, and it's turn-based unlike Genshin Impact, which almost feels like kind of Breath of the Wild gone anime a little bit mixed with some traditional RPG elements.

2168
02:12:51,520 --> 02:12:55,840
But Honkai is going to be a turn-based RPG, which could be very interesting.

2169
02:12:56,800 --> 02:13:00,320
And there are trailers, but the trailers don't tell you shit.

2170
02:13:00,320 --> 02:13:04,000
They're just basically anime characters and all that stuff and trying to get you into it.

2171
02:13:05,600 --> 02:13:19,040
The story will follow a protagonist with a stellaron implant that is a mysterious life form that responds to the world's desire to advance on a quest to discover the truth about the, their words, cancer of all worlds.

2172
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:26,960
The tutorial level is on Herta Space Station, and then you go to a snow planet, Jorilov 6, and other diverse world.

2173
02:13:26,960 --> 02:13:28,160
It is a free to play game.

2174
02:13:28,160 --> 02:13:34,560
And of course, that means they're going to use gacha mechanics, loot boxes, characters, items to monetize.

2175
02:13:36,880 --> 02:13:38,560
Do you go to diverse systems?

2176
02:13:40,480 --> 02:13:40,980
No.

2177
02:13:42,800 --> 02:13:45,040
So this is a free to play game.

2178
02:13:45,040 --> 02:13:46,720
It's going to be rated T for Teen.

2179
02:13:46,720 --> 02:13:51,040
It will be on PC, but it is exclusive to Epic Game Store on PC.

2180
02:13:51,040 --> 02:13:56,960
But it'll also be available on iOS and Android and then eventually a PlayStation version.

2181
02:13:56,960 --> 02:13:59,440
And that seemed to be when Genshin really took off.

2182
02:13:59,440 --> 02:14:03,440
So it'll be interesting to see that how this does at first, but we'll see.

2183
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:04,500
So.

2184
02:14:05,040 --> 02:14:05,540
All right.

2185
02:14:06,880 --> 02:14:09,680
That's it for the stories we have on deck currently.

2186
02:14:09,680 --> 02:14:13,360
I did want to mention, it oddly didn't come up in the rest of the show.

2187
02:14:13,360 --> 02:14:18,960
But there were some big conventions going on this weekend, namely Game Developers Conference,

2188
02:14:18,960 --> 02:14:24,320
which some of these things, which funny enough, you know, that whole Counter-Strike 2 thing

2189
02:14:25,040 --> 02:14:32,960
that was timed at the exact same time as Epic's big thing at Game Developer Conference.

2190
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:34,720
Coincidence?

2191
02:14:35,840 --> 02:14:36,480
I think not.

2192
02:14:36,480 --> 02:14:37,680
I think not.

2193
02:14:37,680 --> 02:14:39,920
But just something interesting to know.

2194
02:14:39,920 --> 02:14:42,080
But Game Developers Conference was this weekend, of course.

2195
02:14:42,080 --> 02:14:46,320
And so, you know, not that Game Developers Conference is a place where they do a lot

2196
02:14:46,320 --> 02:14:49,200
of announcements, but sometimes we get things out of it, right?

2197
02:14:49,200 --> 02:14:52,320
Like Sony has been known to show off things.

2198
02:14:52,320 --> 02:14:55,040
Like I want to say the move was there, you know, some time ago.

2199
02:14:55,040 --> 02:14:59,280
Sometimes it might be about more like peripherals and those sorts of things to like future

2200
02:14:59,280 --> 02:15:01,200
developments of these things.

2201
02:15:01,200 --> 02:15:04,320
But you usually don't get a lot of gaming news news out of GDC.

2202
02:15:04,320 --> 02:15:06,160
PAX East was also this weekend.

2203
02:15:07,040 --> 02:15:12,000
Again, not a place you get a ton of news usually, but there are oftentimes panels

2204
02:15:12,240 --> 02:15:14,400
that can even be put on by developers.

2205
02:15:15,200 --> 02:15:19,680
And so actually, I know there was a Final Fantasy XIV panel as well as a Final Fantasy

2206
02:15:19,680 --> 02:15:22,240
XVI panel because Yoshida was there.

2207
02:15:23,680 --> 02:15:27,440
But it didn't seem like there was a lot of new information out of those panels, except

2208
02:15:27,440 --> 02:15:32,880
apparently, you know, if you believe it, and I don't see why not, Yoshi P was playing

2209
02:15:32,880 --> 02:15:36,320
Final Fantasy XVI on a PlayStation 5 live.

2210
02:15:36,320 --> 02:15:38,960
Like they had the controller there and they were playing the game live.

2211
02:15:38,960 --> 02:15:43,440
So it's that close to being done, which for a June release, you would expect it needs

2212
02:15:43,440 --> 02:15:45,520
to be at that kind of state at this point.

2213
02:15:45,520 --> 02:15:49,600
It may not be like gold, but at real close, real close at this point.

2214
02:15:49,600 --> 02:15:50,720
So, yeah.

2215
02:15:50,720 --> 02:15:57,040
And DJ Rama S also points off a ton of other gaming adjacent, you know, nerdy conventions

2216
02:15:57,040 --> 02:15:57,920
and other places too.

2217
02:15:58,640 --> 02:16:02,480
WonderCon, ZenkaiaCon, GalaxyCon, all of those are this week.

2218
02:16:02,480 --> 02:16:03,760
I had a friend at WonderCon.

2219
02:16:03,760 --> 02:16:04,960
So it's, yeah, busy.

2220
02:16:04,960 --> 02:16:09,440
And I know the cast of, at least some of the cast of anime jam session was at ZenkaiaCon

2221
02:16:09,440 --> 02:16:11,440
because I saw DJ Rama's post.

2222
02:16:12,080 --> 02:16:18,400
So ZenkaiaCon, no ZenkaiaCon, ZenkaiaCon.

2223
02:16:18,400 --> 02:16:19,600
I keep adding an extra vowel.

2224
02:16:20,240 --> 02:16:20,740
All right.

2225
02:16:22,080 --> 02:16:27,040
So anyway, let's go to the listener roundtable.

2226
02:16:27,040 --> 02:16:28,720
We want to check in with some emails.

2227
02:16:28,720 --> 02:16:32,160

2233
02:16:47,360 --> 02:16:48,480
Too much crap on my desk.

2234
02:16:51,760 --> 02:16:53,280
So we do have an email.

2235
02:16:53,280 --> 02:16:53,780
Yay.

2236
02:16:54,400 --> 02:16:54,900
Uno.

2237
02:16:55,920 --> 02:16:56,420
If you're ready?

2238
02:16:57,040 --> 02:16:57,540
Yes.

2239
02:16:57,540 --> 02:16:58,640
Hello, LR.

2240
02:16:58,640 --> 02:16:59,760
So, hi, Y-Y-R.

2241
02:17:00,400 --> 02:17:04,480
You may already have mentioned this earlier in the show, but for the possible benefits

2242
02:17:04,480 --> 02:17:07,840
of the live listeners, I just want to iterate or reiterate one thing tonight.

2243
02:17:07,840 --> 02:17:12,800
March 26 could be your last opportunity to purchase games, DLC, and other items from

2244
02:17:12,800 --> 02:17:15,280
the Nintendo eShop, either on 3DS or Wii U.

2245
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:18,160
Nintendo's own language is vague.

2246
02:17:18,160 --> 02:17:23,040
As of March 27th, 2023, it will no longer be possible to make purchases.

2247
02:17:23,040 --> 02:17:28,400
So as we don't know whether the shop is shutting down tonight at midnight Pacific time, tomorrow

2248
02:17:28,400 --> 02:17:33,200
morning, or at some other time tomorrow, it would be prudent to assume that tonight is

2249
02:17:33,200 --> 02:17:33,920
your last chance.

2250
02:17:34,480 --> 02:17:38,080
I was wondering if it was going to be on Tokyo time.

2251
02:17:38,080 --> 02:17:42,880
Anyway, while this is not the first digital store shut down on a major platform, it's

2252
02:17:42,880 --> 02:17:45,280
certainly the most significant to date.

2253
02:17:45,280 --> 02:17:52,400
We are not often lamenting the loss of DLC on the original Xbox or the loss of the PlayStation

2254
02:17:52,400 --> 02:17:57,440
mobile games on Vita, but here we are losing a significant portion of Nintendo's history,

2255
02:17:57,440 --> 02:18:02,080
spanning over 10 years and even more than that if you consider that this will mark the

2256
02:18:02,080 --> 02:18:03,840
end of Virtual Console.

2257
02:18:03,840 --> 02:18:08,800
Yes, it will no longer be possible to outright buy digital copies of Nintendo's classic games.

2258
02:18:08,800 --> 02:18:13,440
After tomorrow, you can only subscribe to them via Nintendo Switch online.

2259
02:18:13,440 --> 02:18:19,600
It is still possible to add funds to your 3DS and Wii U as long as you linked them to

2260
02:18:19,600 --> 02:18:20,960
your Nintendo account.

2261
02:18:20,960 --> 02:18:25,520
Just add funds either on your Switch or on Nintendo's website and they will instantly

2262
02:18:25,520 --> 02:18:28,320
appear on your linked 3DS and Wii U consoles.

2263
02:18:28,320 --> 02:18:31,200
It will also be possible to redownload content after the closures.

2264
02:18:31,200 --> 02:18:32,080
Don't worry about that.

2265
02:18:32,640 --> 02:18:36,320
Here is a partial list of things that will be disappearing tomorrow that you might not

2266
02:18:36,320 --> 02:18:37,520
have considered.

2267
02:18:37,520 --> 02:18:42,160
All of the games available via Street Pass Me Plaza, Street Pass itself will still work.

2268
02:18:42,880 --> 02:18:47,200
All of the DLC available for all of the Fire Emblem games released on 3DS.

2269
02:18:47,200 --> 02:18:51,920
This includes the entire final campaign of the Fire Emblem Fates, which is only otherwise

2270
02:18:51,920 --> 02:18:56,400
available on the physical special edition, which now goes for over $500 on eBay.

2271
02:18:57,040 --> 02:19:01,440
The Nintendo DS Virtual Console games available on Wii U, which will allow you to use your

2272
02:19:01,440 --> 02:19:04,240
TV as the top screen and the Wii U gamepad as the bottom screen.

2273
02:19:04,960 --> 02:19:09,760
All of the hundreds of available free demos, the ability to unlock minigames and Rusty's

2274
02:19:09,760 --> 02:19:14,320
real-deal baseball, as well as the ability to progress through the story of the game

2275
02:19:14,320 --> 02:19:14,800
itself.

2276
02:19:15,360 --> 02:19:19,920
The digital versions of Pokemon Red, Blue, Yellow, Gold, Silver, and Crystal, which will

2277
02:19:19,920 --> 02:19:24,880
allow you to transfer Pokemon forward into other 3DS games or the new Pokemon Home.

2278
02:19:26,160 --> 02:19:30,160
The Pokemon Bank app, which you'll need if you want to transfer anything forward from

2279
02:19:30,160 --> 02:19:31,920
any of the pre-switch Pokemon games.

2280
02:19:32,480 --> 02:19:36,960
The ridiculous love child of Derby Owners Club and Tri-Peak Solitaire that is Pocket

2281
02:19:36,960 --> 02:19:37,840
Card Jockey.

2282
02:19:37,840 --> 02:19:40,480
Trust me on this one, it's $6 well spent.

2283
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:47,600
Just one more reminder that DLC in the Nintendo 3DS games is only available via the games

2284
02:19:47,600 --> 02:19:48,560
themselves.

2285
02:19:48,560 --> 02:19:53,920
In some cases, you'll need to progress beyond a certain point before the DLC becomes available.

2286
02:19:53,920 --> 02:19:57,920
For example, in New Super Mario Brothers 2, you need to finish World 1 before you can

2287
02:19:57,920 --> 02:19:59,520
buy the Coin Rush Course packs.

2288
02:20:00,160 --> 02:20:04,320
Good luck to everyone and try not to spend too much, and of course, enjoy your week.

2289
02:20:04,320 --> 02:20:05,600
I spent way too much money.

2290
02:20:05,600 --> 02:20:06,480
Aaron, YYR.

2291
02:20:07,600 --> 02:20:09,360
Well, thanks for the heads up, Aaron.

2292
02:20:09,360 --> 02:20:11,920
We did talk a little bit about this last week, but...

2293
02:20:12,560 --> 02:20:13,200
Oh, go ahead.

2294
02:20:13,760 --> 02:20:17,840
Well, I was just going to say what Mike said, Pocket Card Jockey is on Apple Arcade.

2295
02:20:18,800 --> 02:20:19,520
There was a little bit of...

2296
02:20:20,400 --> 02:20:25,920
YYR is talking with somebody in Discord about that and kind of giving his case for why

2297
02:20:27,280 --> 02:20:31,280
there may still be some reason to get the 3DS version even with the Apple Arcade version

2298
02:20:31,280 --> 02:20:33,440
out there, but that's really a preference thing at this point.

2299
02:20:33,440 --> 02:20:37,360
But I was going to point out, we did talk a little bit about this last week, but I know

2300
02:20:37,360 --> 02:20:42,160
YYR has been traveling because I saw where the gifts were coming from, YYR and Pokemon,

2301
02:20:43,120 --> 02:20:45,520
which I wish you'd let me know, but that's all right, that's all right.

2302
02:20:45,840 --> 02:20:47,680
It's freaking cute, by the way.

2303
02:20:47,680 --> 02:20:48,180
What's that?

2304
02:20:48,880 --> 02:20:49,760
The game is super cute, by the way.

2305
02:20:49,760 --> 02:20:50,560
Oh, yeah, it's cute.

2306
02:20:51,600 --> 02:20:56,080
But I did like in there that there were a lot of suggestions because we were asking for

2307
02:20:56,080 --> 02:20:59,600
those last week, and I had forgotten about things like Pocket Card Jockey and some of

2308
02:20:59,600 --> 02:21:04,080
those other things he kind of gets into there, so I like the recommendation list there.

2309
02:21:04,080 --> 02:21:07,680
I do want to say, with all that being said, there is a part of me, and I kind of referenced

2310
02:21:07,680 --> 02:21:10,880
this earlier in the show, there's a part of me that's like, you know what, at this point,

2311
02:21:10,880 --> 02:21:14,560
I don't want to reward Nintendo for what they're doing here, because you're right,

2312
02:21:15,520 --> 02:21:18,240
and I'm not policing anyone else's activity.

2313
02:21:18,240 --> 02:21:19,840
Y'all spend your money on what makes you happy.

2314
02:21:19,840 --> 02:21:22,560
I'm just going to be completely, bluntly, brutally honest.

2315
02:21:23,440 --> 02:21:27,280
If the store is closing at this point, and Nintendo is effectively done with support

2316
02:21:27,280 --> 02:21:31,040
for these systems, then I'm waiting for the next homebrew to come out to crack the shit

2317
02:21:31,040 --> 02:21:33,440
out of these things, because Nintendo probably won't patch it.

2318
02:21:33,440 --> 02:21:34,320
They might.

2319
02:21:34,320 --> 02:21:35,200
They still might.

2320
02:21:35,200 --> 02:21:38,880
I feel like they'll wake up their team enough to be able to do that, but I think we're

2321
02:21:38,880 --> 02:21:42,720
going to get some pretty solid homebrew stuff, and essentially, the piracy is going to be

2322
02:21:42,800 --> 02:21:47,840
wide open for this, and do I care at this point?

2323
02:21:47,840 --> 02:21:51,920
No, because Nintendo has literally taken the legitimate avenue away.

2324
02:21:53,040 --> 02:21:58,640
But let's also be honest, am I itching to get in there and play 3DS games and Wii U

2325
02:21:58,640 --> 02:22:02,560
games, especially with what else is going on this year?

2326
02:22:02,560 --> 02:22:03,120
Not really.

2327
02:22:04,160 --> 02:22:09,200
But I also understand, and I've openly admitted this on the show, I don't usually play a lot

2328
02:22:09,200 --> 02:22:13,200
of games on the go, and there are a lot of people that feel very differently about gaming

2329
02:22:13,200 --> 02:22:16,160
who love to play on the Switch, who love to play on the 3DS.

2330
02:22:16,160 --> 02:22:16,880
Cool.

2331
02:22:16,880 --> 02:22:20,080
So again, you've got to do what you've got to do.

2332
02:22:20,080 --> 02:22:22,720
For me, I don't want to give Nintendo any more money over this.

2333
02:22:23,600 --> 02:22:27,360
At this point, I'll turn to piracy if there's something, or emulation is probably what it'll

2334
02:22:27,360 --> 02:22:29,520
really be by the time I really want to get around to something.

2335
02:22:29,520 --> 02:22:33,280
I'll turn to emulation to look at playing some of these games from the past that I'd

2336
02:22:33,280 --> 02:22:33,760
like to do.

2337
02:22:35,440 --> 02:22:38,640
But we should also endorse the legitimate routes.

2338
02:22:38,640 --> 02:22:40,160
I realize it's a slippery slope.

2339
02:22:41,280 --> 02:22:41,760
There you go.

2340
02:22:42,400 --> 02:22:43,440
We have some calls.

2341
02:22:43,440 --> 02:22:45,520
Arguments by their nature are fallacious.

2342
02:22:47,280 --> 02:22:49,360
Let's get into the green room.

2343
02:22:49,360 --> 02:22:52,560
We have some calls waiting to get on air tonight, so let's get to it.

2344
02:22:52,560 --> 02:22:55,920
I'm going to start bringing some folks on, and let's bring our first caller on.

2345
02:22:55,920 --> 02:22:58,080
And hello, you are on Orange Launch Radio.

2346
02:22:58,080 --> 02:22:58,560
Who's this?

2347
02:22:59,680 --> 02:23:07,200
Hi, this is Fixation Gaze, a friend of Jamie's and a short time enjoyer of the VOG Network.

2348
02:23:07,200 --> 02:23:08,480
Well, hello, hello.

2349
02:23:08,480 --> 02:23:10,560
I recognize you from Team Eat.

2350
02:23:10,560 --> 02:23:13,600
I believe you all call yourselves over there on our channel.

2351
02:23:13,600 --> 02:23:14,160
Yes.

2352
02:23:14,160 --> 02:23:16,320
So welcome to Orange Launch Radio.

2353
02:23:17,760 --> 02:23:20,960
Our branded jackets are coming soon, but thank you for having me.

2354
02:23:23,120 --> 02:23:26,720
I've never done a call-in before, but one of the topics I wanted to bring up is something

2355
02:23:26,720 --> 02:23:31,440
that makes me especially happy recently is the Resident 4 remake.

2356
02:23:31,440 --> 02:23:34,960
Yes, a friend of mine was playing this, and I was watching him play this.

2357
02:23:34,960 --> 02:23:36,160
It looks so good.

2358
02:23:36,160 --> 02:23:37,280
Yes, please elaborate.

2359
02:23:37,280 --> 02:23:37,600
Yeah, yeah.

2360
02:23:38,560 --> 02:23:44,800
Okay, so I'm going to preface this with Resident Evil is a long time hyper fixation of mine.

2361
02:23:44,800 --> 02:23:52,000
So seeing the remake has been almost like kind of a sacrilegious kind of experience because

2362
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:55,680
it's like they keep some of the things that make it so integral and so good, but then

2363
02:23:55,680 --> 02:23:57,040
they also add things.

2364
02:23:57,040 --> 02:24:01,280
And at first it's like, oh gosh, change is scary, which is normal for people who are

2365
02:24:01,280 --> 02:24:05,840
hardcore fans, but then they turn it into something like absolutely excellent.

2366
02:24:06,560 --> 02:24:11,440
Um, such as one of the biggest things that they changed that a lot of people won't really

2367
02:24:11,440 --> 02:24:16,320
see when they just play through the game normally is when you break boxes now, instead of like

2368
02:24:16,320 --> 02:24:18,720
taking out your knife, now Leon does a little kick.

2369
02:24:19,280 --> 02:24:24,080
And that's something you wouldn't notice with a normal gameplay, but with, but with, you

2370
02:24:24,080 --> 02:24:29,200
know, like compare and contrast exactly back to the old games, the one of the biggest things

2371
02:24:29,200 --> 02:24:33,760
that some people didn't like was how it was slow to take out your knife and hit boxes.

2372
02:24:33,840 --> 02:24:36,800
And now it's sped up in a way that's believable.

2373
02:24:36,800 --> 02:24:42,640
So it was terrifying to see like a new aspect of something I care very deeply about, but

2374
02:24:42,640 --> 02:24:47,920
they they've treaded that ground with such care and respect that it is.

2375
02:24:47,920 --> 02:24:52,320
I really applaud Capcom on this, but I also do have to bring up the, uh, a lot of people

2376
02:24:52,320 --> 02:24:57,680
have been talking about how it glitches and how it's causing computer crash crashes and

2377
02:24:57,680 --> 02:24:59,760
not working as well as it should.

2378
02:25:01,280 --> 02:25:02,560
And that is something to bring up.

2379
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:07,680
Hopefully it's something they can kind of address with patches, which I know we all

2380
02:25:07,680 --> 02:25:11,120
hate that this is where the industry is at, but the reality is this is where the industry

2381
02:25:11,120 --> 02:25:11,840
is at.

2382
02:25:11,840 --> 02:25:16,560
And I tend to cut these companies a little more slack when it comes to PC gaming, because

2383
02:25:16,560 --> 02:25:19,200
reality is every PC configuration is different.

2384
02:25:19,200 --> 02:25:21,440
So it is kind of hard to test every configuration.

2385
02:25:21,440 --> 02:25:26,400
So I do, I cut a little more slack on PC based issues because it can be hard to find those

2386
02:25:26,400 --> 02:25:26,960
things.

2387
02:25:26,960 --> 02:25:30,240
So at least there's that potential to patch that stuff later on.

2388
02:25:30,240 --> 02:25:32,400
And hopefully Capcom stays on top of that.

2389
02:25:32,400 --> 02:25:33,200
I think they will.

2390
02:25:33,200 --> 02:25:35,920
Their track record kind of shows they're pretty good about the patching and they can

2391
02:25:35,920 --> 02:25:37,280
get some of those issues fixed.

2392
02:25:37,280 --> 02:25:44,000
But considering what a legendary game Resident Evil 4 is, I mean, there's many, many people

2393
02:25:44,000 --> 02:25:47,920
that consider that that is the best GameCube game, period.

2394
02:25:48,880 --> 02:25:51,120
And maybe even other platforms too.

2395
02:25:52,720 --> 02:25:57,760
The fact that this is a bit of an upgrade when not everything lately in the remaster

2396
02:25:57,760 --> 02:25:59,200
department has been an upgrade.

2397
02:25:59,200 --> 02:26:02,720
The Secret of Mana remake kind of had some bad issues with it.

2398
02:26:02,720 --> 02:26:06,400
Trials of Mana came out a little better and I think maybe redeemed things, but Secret

2399
02:26:06,400 --> 02:26:07,920
of Mana really should have been better than it was.

2400
02:26:08,480 --> 02:26:10,400
Chrono Cross, we were talking about that.

2401
02:26:10,400 --> 02:26:14,640
Finally, a year after the fact, Radical Dreamers Edition gets a patch to fix it.

2402
02:26:14,640 --> 02:26:16,160
But the remaster, eh.

2403
02:26:16,160 --> 02:26:21,920
So it's nice to hear that Capcom is kind of getting a lot of Ws in these Resident Evil

2404
02:26:22,480 --> 02:26:25,680
because I know the earlier remasters were pretty well received too, but this was the

2405
02:26:25,680 --> 02:26:29,760
one people were really waiting for because it's like, don't screw up 4.

2406
02:26:29,760 --> 02:26:30,800
Don't screw up 4.

2407
02:26:31,360 --> 02:26:38,160
Yeah, because of how dense of a game 4 really is and how much it draws from and takes inspiration

2408
02:26:38,160 --> 02:26:43,760
because we're dealing with a virus that takes control of people's minds via parasites and

2409
02:26:43,760 --> 02:26:47,360
we're dealing with politics and we're dealing with giants and fish monsters.

2410
02:26:47,360 --> 02:26:51,680
There is so much in this game that is extremely easy to get it wrong.

2411
02:26:51,680 --> 02:26:52,720
It really is.

2412
02:26:52,720 --> 02:26:58,240
So the fact that they've taken it with grace and it feels good to go through the game.

2413
02:26:58,240 --> 02:26:59,760
It doesn't feel like any of it's rushed.

2414
02:26:59,760 --> 02:27:01,200
It feels like it's open enough.

2415
02:27:01,920 --> 02:27:03,040
There's a lot of double backing.

2416
02:27:03,040 --> 02:27:06,160
They've added new little side quests, which are a lot of fun.

2417
02:27:07,360 --> 02:27:12,560
But I feel like they've taken Resident Evil 4 and I think they did it really well.

2418
02:27:12,560 --> 02:27:16,400
They've of course removed some of the original funny lines, but they've kept a lot of what

2419
02:27:16,400 --> 02:27:21,520
makes Leon Leon at this phase in what is quote unquote his life, because of course this is

2420
02:27:21,520 --> 02:27:22,480
a game character.

2421
02:27:22,480 --> 02:27:25,360
But they've stayed true to what he was in Resident Evil 4.

2422
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:29,920
And so far from what I've seen, I haven't played through the whole game, mind you.

2423
02:27:29,920 --> 02:27:32,960
They have stayed true to what Ashley is.

2424
02:27:32,960 --> 02:27:39,280
And that was another big thing about Resident Evil 4 originally was how fucking annoying

2425
02:27:39,280 --> 02:27:39,840
she was.

2426
02:27:41,040 --> 02:27:46,240
But it seems like they've toned her down, but also staying to her personality.

2427
02:27:46,240 --> 02:27:51,760
And that is something that's very important to me for the validity of it being a remaster.

2428
02:27:52,080 --> 02:27:55,520
And sometimes these remakes really do redeem certain characters.

2429
02:27:55,520 --> 02:27:58,560
I think back to the Final Fantasy 7 remake and Aerith.

2430
02:27:58,560 --> 02:28:03,040
And I think Jamie, I remember even you saying, you know, she doesn't bother me in the remake

2431
02:28:03,040 --> 02:28:04,800
as much as she did in the original.

2432
02:28:04,800 --> 02:28:07,280
But her fucking annoying as she was.

2433
02:28:10,720 --> 02:28:12,960
And the voice actors did a tremendous job as well.

2434
02:28:12,960 --> 02:28:14,080
Should be committed for that.

2435
02:28:14,080 --> 02:28:14,800
Absolutely.

2436
02:28:15,600 --> 02:28:18,960
I still don't have my save file so I can fight Jenova and then watch her die.

2437
02:28:19,840 --> 02:28:22,640
Let me ask you this, because I know we want to get to another call before we wrap up the

2438
02:28:22,640 --> 02:28:26,640
show, but I want to ask you this as someone who's a self-described Resident Evil fan.

2439
02:28:26,640 --> 02:28:30,240
You know, do you hope that they keep going with these remakes?

2440
02:28:30,240 --> 02:28:31,760
Do you want to see an RE5?

2441
02:28:31,760 --> 02:28:35,360
I know 5 and 6 weren't quite as well received in the bigger picture.

2442
02:28:35,360 --> 02:28:37,520
Do you want them to try again with those games?

2443
02:28:37,520 --> 02:28:39,520
Or where do you kind of hope these remakes go?

2444
02:28:39,520 --> 02:28:43,120
Or are you like, stop here, quit when you're ahead, stop here, don't do any more.

2445
02:28:44,240 --> 02:28:48,320
So this might be a controversial take because I speak on behalf of me, but not really like

2446
02:28:48,320 --> 02:28:52,640
Resident Evil fans as a whole, because we're kind of divided on some things.

2447
02:28:52,640 --> 02:28:57,760
But honestly, with the resources they have now and the ideas and how they've seen things

2448
02:28:57,760 --> 02:29:03,120
turn out, I think they should give it another shot, rework some of those games and release

2449
02:29:03,120 --> 02:29:04,800
them to be better.

2450
02:29:04,800 --> 02:29:10,880
I think they should absolutely go through with remaking the whole original series before

2451
02:29:10,880 --> 02:29:16,000
the new arc, which is the Ethan Winters arc that comes in 7 and 8.

2452
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:17,440
But I think they should.

2453
02:29:17,440 --> 02:29:20,640
Because they really tried to bite more than they could chew when they made those games

2454
02:29:20,640 --> 02:29:21,280
originally.

2455
02:29:21,920 --> 02:29:23,360
And they should do it.

2456
02:29:23,360 --> 02:29:24,080
I think they should.

2457
02:29:24,080 --> 02:29:27,040
They should put their money where their mouth is and do it all.

2458
02:29:27,040 --> 02:29:30,160
Well, you have at least one person in chat agreeing with you because Shane says they

2459
02:29:30,160 --> 02:29:31,120
better remake 6.

2460
02:29:32,960 --> 02:29:34,000
Absolutely.

2461
02:29:34,000 --> 02:29:34,720
Absolutely.

2462
02:29:36,160 --> 02:29:38,000
Fixie, real quick before we let you go.

2463
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:43,360
I know you're in the process of trying to grow your own.

2464
02:29:43,360 --> 02:29:45,120
Is that a nickname you prefer?

2465
02:29:45,120 --> 02:29:47,120
I'm only calling you that because Jamie calls you that.

2466
02:29:47,520 --> 02:29:47,840
Fine.

2467
02:29:47,840 --> 02:29:48,400
You're fine.

2468
02:29:48,400 --> 02:29:53,360
I've gotten a lot of variations on my username, and I think Fixie is my favorite so far.

2469
02:29:53,360 --> 02:29:53,860
Okay, okay.

2470
02:29:54,400 --> 02:29:57,280
So I know you're trying to grow your own Twitch channel.

2471
02:29:57,280 --> 02:30:00,480
I gave you a shout out on our channel, but do you want to quickly just kind of plug your

2472
02:30:00,480 --> 02:30:03,520
channel and what folks can expect over on your Twitch channel?

2473
02:30:04,640 --> 02:30:05,360
Oh, sure.

2474
02:30:05,360 --> 02:30:06,160
Absolutely.

2475
02:30:06,160 --> 02:30:10,720
Well, so my channel and my Twitch is what I primarily do is I play a lot of Dead by

2476
02:30:10,720 --> 02:30:16,720
Daylight, but I'm hoping as I upgrade my hardware and I stick to a schedule that I go into more

2477
02:30:16,720 --> 02:30:22,640
of the horror demographic because I used to be a balloon streamer and that is very much

2478
02:30:22,640 --> 02:30:25,040
anti everything horror.

2479
02:30:25,040 --> 02:30:25,920
It is very soft.

2480
02:30:25,920 --> 02:30:29,920
It's very noise is just like soft, repetitive noises.

2481
02:30:30,480 --> 02:30:38,080
But my next big goal is to play the entirety of the Outlast series and then want to start

2482
02:30:38,080 --> 02:30:40,320
and do the entire Resident Evil series.

2483
02:30:41,040 --> 02:30:45,680
Well, somebody, I'm going to tell you this, you won't catch me ever doing a play through

2484
02:30:45,680 --> 02:30:48,080
of Outlast, so you are braver than I.

2485
02:30:49,280 --> 02:30:57,840
I had a hyper fixation on Outlast Whistleblower, which is by far to me one of the most horrific

2486
02:30:57,840 --> 02:30:59,760
DLCs that has ever been made.

2487
02:31:00,720 --> 02:31:01,440
Oh, my gosh.

2488
02:31:03,360 --> 02:31:07,920
No, that was the game Amnesia I was thinking of where I saw this YouTube where somebody

2489
02:31:07,920 --> 02:31:11,760
I think it was the sequel Amnesia where somebody started it and literally within five seconds

2490
02:31:11,840 --> 02:31:17,200
they go, nope, and they close the game because it scared the shit out of them.

2491
02:31:17,200 --> 02:31:22,160
The first time I ever played Outlast, I had to keep the lights on in the room.

2492
02:31:22,160 --> 02:31:25,840
And I remember I was playing with friends because we had decided if one of us gets too

2493
02:31:25,840 --> 02:31:28,400
scared, another person will hop on and continue.

2494
02:31:28,400 --> 02:31:31,120
And they kept turning the lights off for quote unquote atmosphere.

2495
02:31:31,120 --> 02:31:35,840
And I said, I swear to God, if you do not turn that light on right now, I am not playing

2496
02:31:35,840 --> 02:31:36,480
this.

2497
02:31:36,480 --> 02:31:41,920
But now that I've gotten to be more of a horror buff and a lot more acclimated to screaming

2498
02:31:41,920 --> 02:31:46,480
due to Dead by Daylight and the jump scares that happen in a multiplayer game, I think

2499
02:31:46,480 --> 02:31:50,560
I'm ready to do it by myself with the lights off, with the lights off.

2500
02:31:50,560 --> 02:31:51,360
Oh, my gosh.

2501
02:31:51,360 --> 02:31:52,080
No, no.

2502
02:31:52,080 --> 02:31:57,200
I remember when I played Silent Hill Homecoming for the first time, I was playing it on Xbox

2503
02:31:57,200 --> 02:31:59,040
at home in the middle of a rainstorm.

2504
02:31:59,040 --> 02:32:01,680
And I was playing with the lights off, which is fine, whatever.

2505
02:32:02,400 --> 02:32:08,080
But as I was playing the game and they get to a scary scene, the rain and wind blew the

2506
02:32:08,080 --> 02:32:10,880
front door open because I guess I forgot to lock it.

2507
02:32:10,880 --> 02:32:14,160
And that's when I said, nope, nope, nope.

2508
02:32:14,160 --> 02:32:19,280
I closed the door, immediately powered off the Xbox, went into my room and totally did

2509
02:32:19,280 --> 02:32:20,400
the blanket burrito.

2510
02:32:20,400 --> 02:32:23,040
Or I said, this is where I live now.

2511
02:32:23,040 --> 02:32:24,720
I moved into a blanket.

2512
02:32:24,720 --> 02:32:31,280
I started actually being scared of Call of Duty zombies.

2513
02:32:32,160 --> 02:32:38,560
And now I've yeah, I used to be terrified of everything scary, but now now I fully immerse

2514
02:32:38,560 --> 02:32:40,320
myself into the scary culture.

2515
02:32:40,320 --> 02:32:45,440
I read scary stories in my old house with no lights on in the hallways, and I keep my

2516
02:32:45,440 --> 02:32:46,720
door open and I go to sleep.

2517
02:32:47,600 --> 02:32:51,200
I have fully tamed it out of me and I'm going to do some scary stuff.

2518
02:32:51,200 --> 02:32:55,520
So you guys should totally check me out on my Twitch channel if you like scary things.

2519
02:32:56,240 --> 02:32:56,800
All right.

2520
02:32:56,800 --> 02:32:58,640
Well, and Fixie and I co-stream.

2521
02:32:59,440 --> 02:33:02,240
Yeah, I saw you streaming the other night and you both were.

2522
02:33:02,240 --> 02:33:03,040
Yeah, I saw that.

2523
02:33:03,040 --> 02:33:03,680
So.

2524
02:33:03,680 --> 02:33:04,080
All right.

2525
02:33:04,080 --> 02:33:06,640
Well, Fixie, best of luck with the growth of your own channel.

2526
02:33:06,640 --> 02:33:09,120
I'm going to let you go so we can get another call in here before we end tonight.

2527
02:33:09,120 --> 02:33:12,000
But thanks so much for calling and good luck with the games and your channel growth.

2528
02:33:12,000 --> 02:33:13,360
Thank you so much for having me.

2529
02:33:13,360 --> 02:33:13,920
You're welcome.

2530
02:33:13,920 --> 02:33:14,320
Anytime.

2531
02:33:14,320 --> 02:33:14,800
Take care.

2532
02:33:16,480 --> 02:33:16,880
All right.

2533
02:33:16,880 --> 02:33:20,560
Fixie and I need to have like a watch party where we watch Midsommar.

2534
02:33:21,120 --> 02:33:22,320
Oh, my gosh.

2535
02:33:22,320 --> 02:33:27,280
Is Midsommar on the Amazon service or whatever?

2536
02:33:28,160 --> 02:33:29,840
I don't I don't know.

2537
02:33:30,640 --> 02:33:32,800
I have it on my Apple TV.

2538
02:33:32,800 --> 02:33:33,680
Oh, it's on Prime.

2539
02:33:33,680 --> 02:33:34,160
Cool, cool.

2540
02:33:34,160 --> 02:33:35,360
I love that movie.

2541
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:37,520
I love like the full version of it.

2542
02:33:38,400 --> 02:33:39,760
We got to go to one more call here.

2543
02:33:39,760 --> 02:33:41,280
I definitely want to hear from this individual as well.

2544
02:33:41,280 --> 02:33:44,160
We haven't heard from in a little while, so let's bring them on the air.

2545
02:33:44,160 --> 02:33:45,680
Hi, you are on Orange Launch Radio.

2546
02:33:45,680 --> 02:33:46,160
Who's this?

2547
02:33:47,200 --> 02:33:48,800
Hello, it's Sturlock.

2548
02:33:48,800 --> 02:33:49,600
Hey, Sturlock.

2549
02:33:49,600 --> 02:33:51,360
Thanks for being patient while we took another call.

2550
02:33:51,360 --> 02:33:52,080
How are you tonight?

2551
02:33:52,880 --> 02:33:53,760
I'm pretty good.

2552
02:33:54,640 --> 02:34:04,400
Uh, so it's not my main topic, but I wanted to add an addendum to YYR's email.

2553
02:34:04,400 --> 02:34:05,840
Please, because it's now or never.

2554
02:34:06,480 --> 02:34:07,600
Yeah, um.

2555
02:34:09,600 --> 02:34:19,280
If you're in the US, you're extra screwed because one of the best rhythm games is going

2556
02:34:19,280 --> 02:34:24,240
away and impossible to buy in the US, and that is Rhythm Heaven Megamix.

2557
02:34:24,240 --> 02:34:29,120
Yeah, released physically everywhere else but the US, so that's fun.

2558
02:34:29,760 --> 02:34:32,160
Yeah, a lot of people lamenting the loss of that one.

2559
02:34:32,160 --> 02:34:34,480
I know that's come up in our Discord several times.

2560
02:34:34,480 --> 02:34:35,920
Yep, great game.

2561
02:34:35,920 --> 02:34:38,320
One of the best one of the best rhythm games ever made.

2562
02:34:38,320 --> 02:34:43,520
I really, really, really hope Rhythm Heaven gets a Switch game, even if it's just a re-release

2563
02:34:43,520 --> 02:34:45,360
of Megamix, I would be happy.

2564
02:34:45,680 --> 02:34:50,640
Well, you'll be happy to know Bobby Blackwolf says that's the game that he bought on his

2565
02:34:50,640 --> 02:34:51,520
3DS this week.

2566
02:34:52,080 --> 02:34:52,560
Oh, good.

2567
02:34:54,560 --> 02:34:55,680
It was a great game.

2568
02:34:55,680 --> 02:34:56,880
So what else is on your mind tonight?

2569
02:34:57,680 --> 02:35:01,760
But the main thing I wanted to talk about was Diablo 4.

2570
02:35:02,320 --> 02:35:08,080
I was hoping this might be the case because we were talking on, not Twitter, the other

2571
02:35:08,080 --> 02:35:11,680
one, Mastodon a little bit about this.

2572
02:35:12,640 --> 02:35:18,400
How have you been enjoying the, and for those that have never heard you on the show before,

2573
02:35:18,400 --> 02:35:23,280
you are blind and you love the hell out of games.

2574
02:35:23,280 --> 02:35:27,120
So you oftentimes kind of enlighten us on the accessibility.

2575
02:35:27,120 --> 02:35:30,480
And actually I know, and I gave you a shout out in chat as well, because I know on your

2576
02:35:30,480 --> 02:35:36,720
Twitch channel, I've learned a lot from watching you play games like The Last of Us, like how

2577
02:35:36,720 --> 02:35:39,680
accessibility settings, like how they help.

2578
02:35:39,680 --> 02:35:43,360
It's one thing to know, like what's there, what's all available, but being able to see

2579
02:35:43,360 --> 02:35:47,920
you use these things, like as you're playing the game really helps me understand how they

2580
02:35:47,920 --> 02:35:48,560
really help.

2581
02:35:48,560 --> 02:35:51,920
So I'm actually, so anyway, sorry, but just to set that up for people who may not know

2582
02:35:51,920 --> 02:35:52,320
you.

2583
02:35:52,320 --> 02:35:54,240
I'm really curious about this afternoon.

2584
02:35:54,240 --> 02:35:55,120
Yeah, just afternoon.

2585
02:35:55,120 --> 02:36:00,480
I was playing Hades with some accessibility mods that that game has.

2586
02:36:01,280 --> 02:36:02,720
Hades is fantastic.

2587
02:36:02,720 --> 02:36:05,840
Even without accessibility mods, it's still pretty playable.

2588
02:36:06,480 --> 02:36:14,320
The mods just add some nice, you know, quality of life things specifically for blind people

2589
02:36:14,320 --> 02:36:17,600
and take a lot of the guesswork out of doing some things.

2590
02:36:18,560 --> 02:36:21,120
So what's your take on Diablo 4?

2591
02:36:21,120 --> 02:36:22,960
Diablo 4 is fantastic.

2592
02:36:24,480 --> 02:36:27,360
What about it gets you happy and excited?

2593
02:36:27,360 --> 02:36:36,000
Well, for one, text to speech menus, fantastic.

2594
02:36:38,240 --> 02:36:47,280
It's a little buggy currently in certain spots like the options menu, but I have full faith

2595
02:36:47,280 --> 02:36:53,600
that that's stuff that's going to be fixed, you know, on launch release.

2596
02:36:53,600 --> 02:36:54,160
Mm hmm.

2597
02:36:55,760 --> 02:36:56,960
And they're taking feedback.

2598
02:36:56,960 --> 02:37:01,120
So it's, you know, they're going to be well aware of this stuff.

2599
02:37:04,720 --> 02:37:15,200
The other thing I would say is I do wish we had some sort of nav assist a la Last of Us

2600
02:37:15,920 --> 02:37:19,600
because this is a much, much bigger world than Diablo 3.

2601
02:37:19,600 --> 02:37:20,160
Mm hmm.

2602
02:37:23,200 --> 02:37:25,680
But I mean, games, it's not even out yet.

2603
02:37:25,680 --> 02:37:29,520
I I think we'll we will get something.

2604
02:37:29,520 --> 02:37:33,920
I don't know what form that's going to take, but I think I think we we will get some sort

2605
02:37:33,920 --> 02:37:36,880
of, you know, assistance as far as that's concerned.

2606
02:37:37,680 --> 02:37:45,920
But the other big, big positive is that since we have text to speech, we can manage our

2607
02:37:45,920 --> 02:37:54,720
own gear, gear, you know, names of items and what they do, what their stats at all reads

2608
02:37:54,720 --> 02:37:55,200
for us.

2609
02:37:56,400 --> 02:38:03,440
And as a Diablo 3 player that, you know, blind people can't manage their gear, that's like

2610
02:38:03,440 --> 02:38:10,560
the really the one thing that you absolutely positively need a sighted person to do for

2611
02:38:10,560 --> 02:38:12,720
you is gear management.

2612
02:38:12,720 --> 02:38:15,280
And we don't need that anymore.

2613
02:38:15,280 --> 02:38:16,320
And it's fantastic.

2614
02:38:20,320 --> 02:38:24,400
Like audio feedback's gotten a lot better because I've noticed on certain operating

2615
02:38:24,400 --> 02:38:27,440
systems that voiceover is a lot better than it was.

2616
02:38:27,440 --> 02:38:27,940
Yeah.

2617
02:38:30,400 --> 02:38:38,000
Yeah, for whatever reason, the on PS4 PS5, it's not as robust.

2618
02:38:38,000 --> 02:38:45,840
And I think that just has to do with maybe it's a slightly older build, but I I think

2619
02:38:45,840 --> 02:38:49,920
it's going to have parity at launch.

2620
02:38:49,920 --> 02:38:51,360
I don't think that's going to be an issue.

2621
02:38:51,360 --> 02:38:51,860
Yeah.

2622
02:38:52,720 --> 02:39:00,080
But the other the other really amazing thing that they did for us specifically is you have

2623
02:39:00,080 --> 02:39:10,320
to turn it on the options menu, but items and gold, you know, loot essentially has background

2624
02:39:10,320 --> 02:39:10,820
ambience.

2625
02:39:12,000 --> 02:39:14,400
So you can tell when things are on the ground.

2626
02:39:14,400 --> 02:39:19,280
Yes, I've noticed that it's a version of that is on by default for legendaries.

2627
02:39:20,320 --> 02:39:22,320
Oh, that's it's on by default for legendary.

2628
02:39:22,320 --> 02:39:25,520
Yeah, because I hear like a shimmer type of noise when you're sending your legendary.

2629
02:39:25,520 --> 02:39:26,020
Yeah.

2630
02:39:26,320 --> 02:39:26,720
Yeah.

2631
02:39:26,720 --> 02:39:32,240
And the rarity to the different rarities have different sounds associated with them.

2632
02:39:32,240 --> 02:39:33,280
It's like, oh, that's just a common.

2633
02:39:33,280 --> 02:39:34,720
I can ignore that, like whatever.

2634
02:39:36,720 --> 02:39:38,960
And you can break it down, too, if you want.

2635
02:39:38,960 --> 02:39:44,720
Like, so if you don't care about like, oh, just ignore all the commons, you can absolutely

2636
02:39:44,720 --> 02:39:45,220
do that.

2637
02:39:46,080 --> 02:39:47,280
You can even break it down.

2638
02:39:48,080 --> 02:39:54,320
I only care about weapons or only care about like chess pieces or whatever.

2639
02:39:54,880 --> 02:39:56,000
You can absolutely do that.

2640
02:39:57,360 --> 02:40:02,080
The amount of control you have over it is pretty awesome.

2641
02:40:03,120 --> 02:40:06,640
Do you think I remember one of the last times you called in and granted it was a little

2642
02:40:06,640 --> 02:40:11,840
while ago now, but I remember we were kind of mourning the loss of Hearthstone, you know,

2643
02:40:11,840 --> 02:40:14,880
had an add on that was really helping folks.

2644
02:40:14,880 --> 02:40:19,520
And you were really hoping that Blizzard would kind of take up things with that to help the

2645
02:40:19,520 --> 02:40:21,200
community be able to play Hearthstone.

2646
02:40:21,920 --> 02:40:30,240
Do you feel like Blizzard now is being receptive to feedback from the community and these sorts

2647
02:40:30,240 --> 02:40:30,740
of things?

2648
02:40:31,360 --> 02:40:32,400
Absolutely.

2649
02:40:32,400 --> 02:40:35,840
There was actually an update to that whole situation.

2650
02:40:35,840 --> 02:40:43,040
I don't know if you reported on it, but Blizzard themselves have come out and said that because

2651
02:40:43,040 --> 02:40:59,200
of the outcry and the support for Hearthstone, that they are looking into adding in native

2652
02:40:59,200 --> 02:41:02,960
accessibility for Hearthstone themselves.

2653
02:41:02,960 --> 02:41:03,460
That's great.

2654
02:41:06,400 --> 02:41:12,080
The other really cool thing is that we didn't actually lose access to Hearthstone for all

2655
02:41:12,080 --> 02:41:19,600
that long because the Hearthstone access patch slash mod, whatever you want to call

2656
02:41:19,600 --> 02:41:24,880
it, has basically become a community driven project.

2657
02:41:25,840 --> 02:41:30,720
I thought that part, I think I do remember hearing about that the community kind of took

2658
02:41:30,720 --> 02:41:31,760
over maintenance of that.

2659
02:41:31,760 --> 02:41:36,080
And I've heard that happen in some other cases before, but that's great to be able to keep

2660
02:41:36,080 --> 02:41:36,640
that going.

2661
02:41:36,640 --> 02:41:40,560
But that's really awesome that Blizzard is, you know, listening to that sort of feedback

2662
02:41:40,560 --> 02:41:46,560
and really making these types of meaningful implementations that you can really feel in

2663
02:41:46,560 --> 02:41:48,560
a game like Diablo 4 when you're playing it.

2664
02:41:49,760 --> 02:41:51,120
And that's great.

2665
02:41:52,160 --> 02:41:56,240
Oh, and another thing to add to Hearthstone, which makes me think that they're taking

2666
02:41:56,240 --> 02:42:03,520
this pretty seriously, is somebody looked into, I guess there were some patch notes

2667
02:42:03,520 --> 02:42:07,680
or a roadmap update for Unity accessibility.

2668
02:42:08,000 --> 02:42:10,400
And they called out Blizzard specifically by name.

2669
02:42:10,400 --> 02:42:18,000
There is a patch note that talks about text to speech or like control elements or something

2670
02:42:18,000 --> 02:42:26,000
to that effect specifically for Blizzard or for use of Blizzard games.

2671
02:42:26,000 --> 02:42:28,560
Like they went out of their way to call them out by name.

2672
02:42:28,560 --> 02:42:35,600
So I think we could actually have accessible mobile Hearthstone, which would be pretty

2673
02:42:36,240 --> 02:42:38,000
epic, actually.

2674
02:42:38,720 --> 02:42:40,800
Well, fingers and toes crossed they can get there.

2675
02:42:40,800 --> 02:42:50,400
I really do feel like Blizzard is taking accessibility extremely seriously.

2676
02:42:51,280 --> 02:42:58,160
And actually, one of my friends, super blind man, is in the Hearthstone creator program

2677
02:42:58,160 --> 02:42:58,560
now.

2678
02:42:58,560 --> 02:43:00,960
So that's awesome.

2679
02:43:01,840 --> 02:43:02,720
It's really awesome.

2680
02:43:03,600 --> 02:43:12,560
Controversies aside, there are people at Blizzard that do very good things.

2681
02:43:12,560 --> 02:43:12,800
Right.

2682
02:43:12,800 --> 02:43:15,600
And we have to call out the problems when the problems come up.

2683
02:43:15,600 --> 02:43:21,440
But we can also acknowledge like, hey, this company took feedback and made meaningful

2684
02:43:21,440 --> 02:43:24,080
changes as a result of that feedback.

2685
02:43:24,080 --> 02:43:25,200
Let's applaud that.

2686
02:43:25,200 --> 02:43:28,480
And I think that's why I'm thankful you called in tonight to talk about how far the

2687
02:43:28,480 --> 02:43:30,320
accessibility has come in Diablo 4.

2688
02:43:30,320 --> 02:43:32,400
Is it completely there yet?

2689
02:43:32,400 --> 02:43:32,880
No.

2690
02:43:32,880 --> 02:43:34,720
But are we moving in a meaningful direction?

2691
02:43:34,720 --> 02:43:35,040
Sure.

2692
02:43:35,040 --> 02:43:35,760
Sounds like it.

2693
02:43:35,760 --> 02:43:37,520
It's a huge step in the direction.

2694
02:43:37,520 --> 02:43:41,760
I had fairly low expectations.

2695
02:43:41,760 --> 02:43:45,680
I figured we'd get maybe one or two things.

2696
02:43:45,680 --> 02:43:49,360
But the amount, the framework that's already here is really impressive.

2697
02:43:49,360 --> 02:43:51,680
And I can't wait to see what else they do with it.

2698
02:43:51,680 --> 02:43:51,920
All right.

2699
02:43:51,920 --> 02:43:53,840
Well, Sturlock, I have to let you go so we can wrap up the show.

2700
02:43:53,840 --> 02:43:55,120
But thank you so much for the call.

2701
02:43:55,120 --> 02:43:56,640
And I give you a shout out in chat.

2702
02:43:56,640 --> 02:44:01,920
I hope folks will consider following along and really getting your perspective on games,

2703
02:44:02,000 --> 02:44:04,000
because I think it's really enlightening.

2704
02:44:04,000 --> 02:44:08,240
So as we continue this conversation about accessibility on into the future.

2705
02:44:08,240 --> 02:44:08,480
All right.

2706
02:44:08,480 --> 02:44:09,040
Yeah, definitely.

2707
02:44:09,040 --> 02:44:09,920
Have a good one, Sturlock.

2708
02:44:09,920 --> 02:44:13,440
And I look forward to running Diablo 4 stuff with you in the future.

2709
02:44:13,440 --> 02:44:14,080
Yeah, definitely.

2710
02:44:14,080 --> 02:44:15,120
Good to hear from you again.

2711
02:44:15,120 --> 02:44:15,760
Yeah.

2712
02:44:15,760 --> 02:44:16,240
Take care.

2713
02:44:16,240 --> 02:44:16,960
Good to be here.

2714
02:44:16,960 --> 02:44:17,440
All right.

2715
02:44:17,440 --> 02:44:17,760
See you.

2716
02:44:17,760 --> 02:44:18,000
Bye.

2717
02:44:18,800 --> 02:44:19,760
All right.

2718
02:44:19,760 --> 02:44:22,880
We had some good calls tonight, but it is getting a little late.

2719
02:44:22,880 --> 02:44:26,880
So I want to make sure we wrap up the show and have it all done before it's midnight

2720
02:44:26,880 --> 02:44:27,520
on the East Coast.

2721
02:44:27,520 --> 02:44:29,600
But to do that, I want to check in real quick.

2722
02:44:29,600 --> 02:44:32,960
Just quickly check in our eight last minute stories would address Loki.

2723
02:44:32,960 --> 02:44:33,440
Oh, yeah.

2724
02:44:33,440 --> 02:44:34,240
Two things real quick.

2725
02:44:34,240 --> 02:44:40,240
So first is Microsoft is ending their one dollar Xbox Game Pass offer that they've had

2726
02:44:40,240 --> 02:44:41,360
for a long time.

2727
02:44:41,360 --> 02:44:43,280
I didn't even know that was still a thing.

2728
02:44:44,400 --> 02:44:47,840
So, yes, unfortunately, they are getting rid of that now.

2729
02:44:48,880 --> 02:44:52,240
Instead, they're saying that anyone signed up for Game Pass said.

2730
02:44:53,120 --> 02:45:00,320
Um, we'll see months from existing subscriptions converted into partial months on a sharing

2731
02:45:00,320 --> 02:45:00,640
plan.

2732
02:45:00,640 --> 02:45:04,400
If you're currently signed up for Xbox Game Pass ultimate, the remaining months will turn

2733
02:45:04,400 --> 02:45:09,600
into 18 days of games past friends and family or something like that when they're talking

2734
02:45:09,600 --> 02:45:13,760
about like the successor game past friends and family, I guess.

2735
02:45:15,760 --> 02:45:20,960
But yeah, they're going to have different promotions as well to basically fill the void,

2736
02:45:20,960 --> 02:45:21,360
I guess.

2737
02:45:21,360 --> 02:45:24,400
But I mean, it wasn't always going to be one dollar forever.

2738
02:45:25,120 --> 02:45:33,200
Another thing I did want to mention, though, is I saw I was asked by the guy that runs

2739
02:45:33,200 --> 02:45:33,840
Nest Maker.

2740
02:45:33,840 --> 02:45:37,760
So he has a collection that he's been putting together.

2741
02:45:37,760 --> 02:45:44,640
So in partnership with the Strong Museum of Play, they have a collection of games.

2742
02:45:44,640 --> 02:45:45,680
Basically, it's in New York.

2743
02:45:45,680 --> 02:45:46,560
It's a museum.

2744
02:45:46,560 --> 02:45:48,720
You can go there and play video games.

2745
02:45:48,720 --> 02:45:50,640
They do archival stuff as well.

2746
02:45:50,640 --> 02:45:55,680
So I get to, along with some of the other Nest Maker people, put my game available to

2747
02:45:55,680 --> 02:45:56,720
play there as well.

2748
02:45:56,720 --> 02:46:02,560
So my game will be part of the Strong Museum collection 2023, which I am.

2749
02:46:02,560 --> 02:46:06,560
Loki, are you saying that they put you in a museum?

2750
02:46:06,560 --> 02:46:07,920
They put me in a museum.

2751
02:46:07,920 --> 02:46:11,280
Yeah, I think I think they're probably accessing the website.

2752
02:46:11,280 --> 02:46:15,680
But yes, in a roundabout way, it will be in a museum.

2753
02:46:17,440 --> 02:46:19,440
Loki, it doesn't get much better than that.

2754
02:46:20,320 --> 02:46:25,040
That's a hell of a thing to have on your resume of what you've accomplished in this life.

2755
02:46:25,040 --> 02:46:26,720
Congrats to the fucking Lations.

2756
02:46:26,720 --> 02:46:28,720
They were showing, well, they had...

2757
02:46:28,720 --> 02:46:30,800
I agree with necessary 100 Matt.

2758
02:46:30,800 --> 02:46:32,560
Somebody buried the fucking lead tonight.

2759
02:46:32,560 --> 02:46:34,800
You're going to talk about this in your gaming week.

2760
02:46:34,800 --> 02:46:35,760
This is big news.

2761
02:46:36,800 --> 02:46:38,400
I just thought about it at the last second.

2762
02:46:38,400 --> 02:46:43,840
But they had a Nest Maker panel also at PAX East, which I'd be curious to see how that

2763
02:46:43,840 --> 02:46:44,320
went.

2764
02:46:44,320 --> 02:46:45,200
Well, I hope it's on YouTube.

2765
02:46:45,840 --> 02:46:47,040
Yeah, I hope so.

2766
02:46:47,040 --> 02:46:47,920
I'd like to watch that.

2767
02:46:47,920 --> 02:46:49,120
But yeah, it'd be fun.

2768
02:46:49,120 --> 02:46:50,960
At least you'll be able to play the demo of the game.

2769
02:46:50,960 --> 02:46:52,880
I don't think I didn't put the full game on there.

2770
02:46:53,600 --> 02:46:58,960
Honestly, I would have made the full game available in the museum only, but there wasn't

2771
02:46:58,960 --> 02:47:00,160
really a way to do that.

2772
02:47:00,160 --> 02:47:02,480
But you have a demo version you can play at least.

2773
02:47:02,480 --> 02:47:03,040
Yeah.

2774
02:47:03,040 --> 02:47:04,000
Well, that's great.

2775
02:47:04,000 --> 02:47:05,040
Congratulations on that.

2776
02:47:05,040 --> 02:47:05,680
That's awesome.

2777
02:47:06,400 --> 02:47:07,040
All right.

2778
02:47:07,040 --> 02:47:08,480
But again, way to bury the lead.

2779
02:47:08,480 --> 02:47:11,840
All right, let's go around.

2780
02:47:11,840 --> 02:47:13,920
Let me quickly thank everybody for listening tonight.

2781
02:47:13,920 --> 02:47:16,640
Thank you for tuning in to Orange Launch Radio and supporting this show.

2782
02:47:16,640 --> 02:47:20,000
If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Launch Radio, please tell a friend or an AI

2783
02:47:20,000 --> 02:47:21,280
chat bot about the show.

2784
02:47:21,280 --> 02:47:24,320
Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we

2785
02:47:24,320 --> 02:47:25,840
need more voices.

2786
02:47:25,840 --> 02:47:27,440
Real humans only, please.

2787
02:47:27,440 --> 02:47:34,880
To put out on air to chat with cats and dogs are acceptable, too, but mostly people and

2788
02:47:34,880 --> 02:47:35,120
other.

2789
02:47:36,080 --> 02:47:38,800
Then the bird fans going to email and be like, you left out bird.

2790
02:47:38,800 --> 02:47:39,920
Okay, look, you know what I mean?

2791
02:47:41,040 --> 02:47:42,320
Thank you so much for supporting.

2792
02:47:42,320 --> 02:47:44,240
Tell a friend or two about the show.

2793
02:47:44,240 --> 02:47:45,120
Help us spread the word.

2794
02:47:46,080 --> 02:47:50,800
You know, a nice five star review on a site like iTunes, Spotify, wherever it is you found

2795
02:47:50,800 --> 02:47:51,520
this show.

2796
02:47:51,520 --> 02:47:52,800
That goes a long way.

2797
02:47:52,800 --> 02:47:54,800
So we really appreciate all of that.

2798
02:47:55,760 --> 02:47:56,320
That's that.

2799
02:47:56,320 --> 02:47:58,160
Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

2800
02:47:58,160 --> 02:48:04,000
Dark Sakura, I'm sure we're going to see you swiffing and whatever we say there.

2801
02:48:05,120 --> 02:48:06,160
Swiffing and sliding.

2802
02:48:06,160 --> 02:48:06,660
Yeah.

2803
02:48:08,080 --> 02:48:09,840
Fixie and I will be co-streaming.

2804
02:48:09,840 --> 02:48:10,340
Oh, fun.

2805
02:48:11,060 --> 02:48:16,900
And I think we're going to have Shayla tonight and I have messaged Gwen.

2806
02:48:16,900 --> 02:48:19,780
So team Yeet will be eating around.

2807
02:48:19,780 --> 02:48:21,460
Maybe we'll actually do a yeet match.

2808
02:48:22,580 --> 02:48:25,140
But yeah, and if I may make a mention of something else.

2809
02:48:25,140 --> 02:48:27,700
Yeah, I'm having a subathon on my birthday.

2810
02:48:28,660 --> 02:48:32,580
That's April 19th, starting at 10 a.m. Pacific time.

2811
02:48:32,580 --> 02:48:38,020
And I'm going to try to go the full 24 hours because I'm brave and stupid.

2812
02:48:38,740 --> 02:48:46,420
And if I can hit a total of 250 subs in my channel, I will bleach my hair on stream.

2813
02:48:46,420 --> 02:48:47,620
Oh, that's a big goal.

2814
02:48:47,620 --> 02:48:50,100
But that's on stream.

2815
02:48:50,100 --> 02:48:51,220
That's a fun reward.

2816
02:48:51,220 --> 02:48:54,500
So and then I will promptly re-dye it red.

2817
02:48:56,180 --> 02:48:57,460
No, we'll see what happens.

2818
02:48:57,460 --> 02:49:02,260
Maybe for additional ones, I'll add in another color.

2819
02:49:03,540 --> 02:49:03,860
All right.

2820
02:49:03,860 --> 02:49:04,660
We'll see what happens.

2821
02:49:04,660 --> 02:49:07,140
No, I'm actually I've got full on platinum.

2822
02:49:09,780 --> 02:49:12,740
Nutrisse brand and I have Olaplex.

2823
02:49:12,740 --> 02:49:14,980
I have the stuff to do it and do it safely.

2824
02:49:14,980 --> 02:49:20,340
So if I get hot roots, that's just more incentive to re-dye it.

2825
02:49:20,340 --> 02:49:20,980
We'll see what happens.

2826
02:49:20,980 --> 02:49:23,220
I doubt I'm going to get it, but who knows?

2827
02:49:23,220 --> 02:49:24,020
You never know.

2828
02:49:24,020 --> 02:49:25,380
Got to be ready for it.

2829
02:49:25,380 --> 02:49:28,580
And I might play nurse if I get 150.

2830
02:49:28,580 --> 02:49:29,460
All right.

2831
02:49:29,460 --> 02:49:29,780
All right.

2832
02:49:29,780 --> 02:49:30,820
Well, have a good stream tonight.

2833
02:49:30,820 --> 02:49:31,320
We'll see you.

2834
02:49:31,940 --> 02:49:32,340
Thank you.

2835
02:49:32,340 --> 02:49:32,820
Bye.

2836
02:49:32,820 --> 02:49:33,320
Bye.

2837
02:49:33,720 --> 02:49:34,280
All right.

2838
02:49:34,280 --> 02:49:35,400
Loki, that means it's over to you.

2839
02:49:35,400 --> 02:49:37,080
What's your final thought for tonight?

2840
02:49:37,080 --> 02:49:42,080
A new episode should be out this week featuring Axolotl

2841
02:49:42,080 --> 02:49:43,800
women's area.

2842
02:49:43,800 --> 02:49:45,320
It's pretty amazing.

2843
02:49:45,320 --> 02:49:46,760
Can't wait for you to see it.

2844
02:49:46,760 --> 02:49:47,260
All right.

2845
02:49:48,840 --> 02:49:52,040
I haven't been streaming a lot this week because of all

2846
02:49:52,040 --> 02:49:54,280
the cat drama I talked about earlier in the show.

2847
02:49:54,280 --> 02:49:58,760
And now my husband's in Twitch jail, but I should be streaming

2848
02:49:58,760 --> 02:50:00,840
on my personal channel at some point this week.

2849
02:50:00,840 --> 02:50:03,320
I actually don't terribly know what I'm going to play next.

2850
02:50:03,320 --> 02:50:06,520
I've been toying with the idea of going back to the older

2851
02:50:06,520 --> 02:50:07,240
Pokemon game.

2852
02:50:07,240 --> 02:50:10,040
Well, not that old, but the Pokemon games I never finished,

2853
02:50:10,040 --> 02:50:12,040
especially now that home integration is included.

2854
02:50:12,040 --> 02:50:15,240
I kind of am itching to go back and play Pokemon Arceus.

2855
02:50:16,440 --> 02:50:18,120
I don't know if y'all in chat would be interested in that,

2856
02:50:18,120 --> 02:50:18,840
but give me a shout.

2857
02:50:18,840 --> 02:50:20,920
If you want me to check out Pokemon Arceus.

2858
02:50:21,720 --> 02:50:25,320
I'm also at some point I'll pick up Pokemon Scarlet as well,

2859
02:50:25,320 --> 02:50:27,800
but I'm just for some reason I'm really itching on Arceus.

2860
02:50:27,800 --> 02:50:28,360
I don't know why.

2861
02:50:28,360 --> 02:50:29,000
Like that one.

2862
02:50:29,000 --> 02:50:30,680
I'm like, why didn't I finish that game?

2863
02:50:31,240 --> 02:50:35,000
But now that the home integration is there too, I love

2864
02:50:35,000 --> 02:50:37,480
doing the little mini collection quests and building my

2865
02:50:37,480 --> 02:50:40,280
ultimate Pokemon collection and home.

2866
02:50:40,280 --> 02:50:41,720
I'm kind of down for that.

2867
02:50:41,720 --> 02:50:42,120
So all right.

2868
02:50:42,120 --> 02:50:43,480
Well, thank you for all the kind love in chat.

2869
02:50:43,480 --> 02:50:44,920
Maybe that is something I will do.

2870
02:50:44,920 --> 02:50:48,280
I got to do something to hold me over until June when Diablo

2871
02:50:48,280 --> 02:50:51,000
Fantasy 16, all this stuff comes out.

2872
02:50:51,000 --> 02:50:53,400
So yeah, get some games to hold us over.

2873
02:50:53,400 --> 02:50:53,900
All right.

2874
02:50:54,760 --> 02:50:57,800
Thank you again, everyone, for supporting Orange Mountains

2875
02:50:57,800 --> 02:50:58,840
Radio and our podcast.

2876
02:50:58,840 --> 02:51:00,280
We really appreciate you all.

2877
02:51:00,280 --> 02:51:02,600
953 weeks and counting.

2878
02:51:02,600 --> 02:51:04,760
And I can't wait to see you all in seven days.

2879
02:51:04,760 --> 02:51:05,400
We'll do it again.

2880
02:51:05,400 --> 02:51:06,680
Have a great week, everyone.

2881
02:51:06,680 --> 02:51:07,180
Good night.

2882
02:51:30,280 --> 02:51:33,400
They reflect those of the staff of Orange Lounge Radio nor

2883
02:51:33,400 --> 02:51:36,200
Fog Network, but you know, they were all still.

2884
02:52:00,280 --> 02:52:05,280
Bye.
