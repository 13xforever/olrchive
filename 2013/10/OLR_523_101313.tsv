14043	17048	This week, Microsoft denies that Kinect gathers data for advertising.
17328	24438	A classic RPG series is headed to iOS and Android, and tonight we interview SoCal Mike Kennedy about Retro Magazine and its Kickstarter campaign.
24758	26421	All this and more begins right now.
31806	36669	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
36749	46734	This is Orange Lounge Radio here on October the 13th, 2013 with episode number 523 of our program.
47154	53237	My name is Rob Roberts, joining you over the next few hours to talk about video games, gaming culture, and so on and so on with my co-hosts.
53658	56419	Say hello first off to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
56479	58880	I just thought you were channeling Bea Arthur like you said earlier.
59020	59960	I am a little bit.
60000	62081	I have the raspy voice going on today.
64061	73084	Those of you that follow VOG Network know that Jessica from Understation Live and I were both involved with a production here in Sacramento at the Rocky Horror Picture Show.
73584	76865	Well, that occurred last night and I'm proud to say we sold out.
77045	80466	It was 500 plus seats and the cast did an amazing job.
80846	85667	But I was the host or MC hosting the whole thing and that involved a lot of screaming.
86167	110010	MC Rob, give me an R, give me an R, you know the whole thing at the top of my voice and you know trying to be funny improv and all that but it was great and I will say by missing the show you missed this really I can't even repeat it but it had to do with Pokemon that's all I'm gonna say let's just say I probably keep in mind that the shows that I've had the most fun at were the ones where I did crew stuff
110774	111474	Oh, yeah, yeah.
111494	113435	I remember you used to do tech-related things.
113455	114975	Didn't you play Dr. Scott one time?
115136	116316	I was Dr. Scott one time.
117276	120817	And I was the curtain and the rope, and I held the tank up.
121918	123158	Last night, I played Dr. Scott.
123178	123839	I actually played Eddie.
123899	128840	That was the first time I played Eddie for about... Oh, God, it's probably been like 12 years since I played Eddie.
129340	131361	But, yeah, good old meatloaf.
131941	132241	Yeah.
132562	132842	All right.
133022	139104	But I still think it's ironic that in the original production that he was Dr. Scott and not...
140044	140585	He was both.
140846	147835	Well, he was both at one point, and that's why a lot of movie shadow casts will do both, especially if they're stretched for people like we were.
148836	156387	But no, I have more fun when I'm not looking at the crowd when they're behind me, and I'm not looking at a sea of people.
156867	158408	See, the crowd thing doesn't bother me at all.
158428	162269	That's just, I guess that's just part of my, like, you know, how I'm wired.
162349	164190	Like, you know, I'm able to do, well, this is easy.
164210	165130	You are an attention whore.
165150	169292	This is easy because we don't, yeah, but you make it sound like I'm like self-centered or something like that too.
169332	170373	And I really like to think I'm not.
170413	173454	Some people are fine with the public speaking thing.
173894	179596	And it's not that I have a problem with public speaking, although I actually have a pathological fear of microphones and public speaking.
179796	180437	Yet here you are.
180937	184058	No, microphones and public speaking as in in front of a crowd with a microphone.
184118	184458	Okay.
184518	186339	I hate the way my voice sounds amplified.
187432	188713	Oh, hearing the echo and all that.
188913	189333	Exactly.
189653	191934	I don't even like listening to myself in recordings.
193114	195495	So I actually have to practice modulating my voice.
197375	199416	Well, my voice is definitely being modulated tonight.
199876	206238	Well, I'm running on four hours of sleep because apparently the insomnia creature decided to bitch slap me.
207118	208399	And I woke up at like...
209778	210258	TechmasterLoki
230223	230503	Yeah.
230703	231564	Hey, how you doing, Loki?
231764	232364	I'm doing alright.
232464	232785	Yeah?
232925	235026	Did you do any theater productions this weekend?
235727	237067	Have you ever been involved with theater?
237508	239629	You don't really strike me as the type, but maybe like in high school.
239649	242771	Aside from like a drama class in high school, no.
242951	243371	Not really.
243651	244892	I had to choose in high school.
244952	247033	I could take drama or I could take band.
247814	259001	And I'm gonna be honest, I felt kind of guilted by my parents into doing band because it was like, Oh, Rob, your dead grandpa left you this clarinet and, you know, he would be really proud of you if you would go into band.
259021	259101	Yeah.
259321	260662	Rob, butt, butt, band nerd represent I played clarinet
281096	298256	but I if I was left to the choice it's not what I would have picked but I don't regret it at all the only thing that's kind of sad about it is that since I graduated high school I have not touched the clarinet at all I have not played the clarinet since the day I was 18 and graduated high school
298376	299817	I told you what happened to my saxophone, didn't I?
300037	300237	Mm-mm.
300698	305141	It was in, when I moved out here, I had to leave it behind, so I loaned it to my friend who was a music major.
305301	305541	Really?
305661	307242	So she could take the saxophone class.
307362	307562	Mm-hmm.
308062	313826	And, because I played saxophone, I played contralto clarinet, I played alto clarinet, I played damn near everything that was saxophone or clarinet.
313986	314187	Mm-hmm.
314747	321091	And she left it, when she moved to Germany, she left it in her mother's attic in Diberville, Mississippi.
321111	321672	Mm-hmm.
321692	324113	And then this hurricane named Katrina came in and stole her roof.
324353	324654	Oh.
324914	325834	And my saxophone.
326095	327135	Oh, not good.
327215	327596	The end.
327936	328216	Not good.
328636	329457	Hey, how about that?
329517	331699	Loki was trying to talk about his life and we made it about us.
332119	335142	How representative of Orange Lounge Radio.
335803	347473	The only way I'd ever want to learn to play the saxophone is just, and really only just a small part would be just to learn how to play the chord for Epic Sax Man and just do that.
347493	349295	Because that's all you really need to know anyways.
349395	350756	So that's it.
351550	360502	I did, by the way, find a video clip on Tumblr of a guy going in shirtless on a skateboard playing Careless Whisper on a saxophone.
361223	361543	Nice.
362404	367451	All right, going to our chat room because, you know, we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.
367811	370433	at the voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.
370713	375095	We are live right after the Bobby Blackwolf show, and we love interacting with our listeners.
375155	387822	We do call it the show where every gamer has a voice, and Ragenator, using his voice to poke fun a little bit, saying, but Sky, did you go to Bandcamp and tell stories that began with this one time at Bandcamp?
389202	395465	Okay, so, I mean, that movie really just, like, worked that line to death.
395565	399407	But Bandcamp is a real thing, for those of you that didn't do Bandcamp.
399427	400788	But it's not like that.
400908	402829	No, well, okay.
402849	404149	No, no, no, no, no.
404269	405470	We didn't have a camp.
406263	408026	Yeah, we didn't like go off into the woods or anything.
408066	412913	It was go to school for eight hours a day so you can get a jump on learning your field show.
412933	414175	And memorize your music.
414836	421145	And for me in Alabama, it's march in the humid with mosquitoes and lose your shoes in the swamp that we had to practice in.
422306	424228	We would stay overnight one of the nights.
424328	433356	It would usually be a Friday, Saturday, Sunday and we would stay overnight at the school on a Saturday and sleep in the gymnasium because we were supposed to be learning about what it's like when the band goes out on tour.
433856	441603	Mind you, we did the overnight thing on tour once my junior year and we stayed in a Motel 6 or whatever the Canadian version of Motel 6 is.
441683	443745	Some, you know, Maple Room 6.
444065	444585	No, I'm kidding.
444625	445726	I don't know what it was called up there.
445746	447608	Some discount chain in Canada is where we stayed, right?
447628	448429	We never did that shit.
448769	450530	Well, okay, but here's the thing.
450570	457353	Like, at band camp, you put a bunch of, like, horny-ass teenagers in high school together in a group and have them staying overnight.
458054	462536	Yes, some dumb things, dumb, stupid teenager things are gonna happen, and yes, there were games of truth.
462556	463437	That goes for all camp, too.
463457	463937	I mean, seriously.
463957	465277	Yeah, I mean, exactly.
465317	466798	That's not unique to band.
466818	471741	That's any mixed-gender camp, or really, same-gender camp, too, so...
472389	473930	DarkSakura and I, big old band nerds.
473970	475991	What kind of kid were you in high school, Logie?
498450	499090	In high school?
499210	499730	Yeah.
500151	502491	I do pretty much the same stuff in high school I do now.
503111	503571	Seriously.
503792	504892	Except now you have a wife and kid.
505452	505932	Yeah.
506012	507073	I mean, let's see.
507153	513594	In high school, well, I took art all four years in high school, and then one year I took drama as well.
514435	515875	But let's see.
515935	523337	My art class, like, at one point I actually had a free period, so I ended up going into my art class and landing the PCs together and playing games on that.
523537	525578	Of course, it was Red Alert or Duke Nukem 3D.
526518	548431	and then um I used to bring my PlayStation 1 to uh that was actually I think I got my PlayStation 197 oh my god I feel old and so um yeah I used to bring that to school and you play during lunch and I still do that now I bring my systems to work and I play during lunch
549251	550512	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
570311	571272	Tank Wars, VGA, Scorched Earth
588108	591390	Worms is kind of like taking a bite out of that same genre, like Scorched Earth and all that.
591670	596574	But for me, nothing will ever match the mega nuke in Scorched Earth.
596774	601137	That was always fun to watch one of your friends fire that thing off and swallow up seven tanks whole.
601897	604259	See, you're like... I think you and I would have been buds.
605240	613866	My senior year of high school, we had someone bring one of those generator-powered TVs and a Super Nintendo because that's what was new at the time.
614366	615547	It was Super Nintendo.
615567	615647	Yeah.
617442	619724	And... Okay, Grandma, tell us more stories.
620324	629471	But it was when I moved into the dorm, because I was the only one in our block that had a TV in the dorm room, that my roommate's boyfriend left his PlayStation over.
630092	632894	We played a lot of Toshinden, and my room was very popular.
633334	636176	Yeah, in college... We also watched a lot of Sailor Moon.
636356	641380	In college, I had a Super Nintendo with Super Mario Kart, and it's the only reason most of those kids wanted to talk to me.
642301	642461	So...
643300	650762	I also had like VHS copies of like the entire run of Ronin Warriors on VHS because I stayed up to tape them every day.
650963	651223	Nice.
651563	657585	So my room was like Anime Central and I had all of like I had Ranma Project fan subs.
657665	658165	That's awesome.
658785	661206	And I had an unsubbed copy of Rotsukidoji.
663727	665807	So we would make up our own dialogue to it.
667788	668489	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
697948	700632	Just names out there in the industry to kind of freelance for this.
700712	704157	So excited to talk to Mike about that project.
704177	705959	And that'll be in about 10 minutes here live.
706380	710365	If you do want to join us in our chat room, live.vognetwork.com is the place to be.
711026	714651	Before I get into gaming weeks, I had another kickoff topic I wanted to talk about quickly.
715792	726275	I wanted to talk about loaning games out and experiences that you guys have had with loaning out games and loaning out systems and maybe the good or the bad experience because I have a really funny story.
726955	733016	The listeners may not be aware of this, but somebody from Orange Lounge Radio has passed from the first few years of the show.
733376	737677	You might remember a gal who used to come on the show an awful lot named Rice Princess.
738417	744839	Back when Orange Lounge Radio was a station way back in the day on Life 365, I co-hosted a show with her called Outside the Box.
745479	749382	And now she just goes by Princess Irene, I believe, is like her new preferred handle.
749902	761069	Princess Irene got married on Thursday, and her and Silent Nathan, another name from the past, they got married finally this past week.
761129	768113	So congratulations and our well wishes to them, and I'm sure many of the listeners, especially the old school ones when they hear those names, will be excited to hear that they got hitched.
768533	769093	Well, guess what?
769453	772374	Princess Irene went on a honeymoon to Japan.
772814	774895	Perfect nerd honeymoon with her new husband, right?
775015	775875	Oh, man, I'm jealous.
775935	776415	I know, right?
776475	777275	I'm kind of jealous, too.
777635	780636	So they went to Japan, and she actually asked me.
780676	786217	She said, hey, Rob, remember a long time ago you said I could borrow your 3DS to play Animal Crossing at some point?
786277	788358	She's like, would it be possible to do that now?
788418	792159	Because I got a 12-hour flight to Japan, and that would be a great way to pass the time.
792179	793059	And I said, oh, sure.
793519	795579	So she came over Wednesday night.
795619	796400	We caught up a little bit.
796420	798000	I gave her my 3DS, and on she went.
798360	798560	Or 2DS.
823935	824816	Or 2DS.
824856	827038	He actually said, yeah, 2DS would be a good idea too.
827358	829399	And I'm like, Shane, that's money.
830300	830680	That's like $180.
830820	835184	We were talking like $20 maybe, but that's like a whole other system.
835604	841348	So I'm currently having to sit and wait, and I'm missing the Pokemon boat because I loaned out my 3DS.
841408	849694	Now look, I don't regret it because Irene obviously loved her to bits, and if I can bring a little more entertainment to her honeymoon, then so be it.
850115	852316	But it's just kind of one of those things where I was like, don't.
853217	854478	That's too bad, but you know what?
855299	857621	You can turn this upside, or turn this back around.
857982	861285	Because the Grand Theft Auto V ship has made port.
861625	862266	And guess what?
862887	866350	It's available right now for you to go get and play.
867611	873297	So Salesman Loki is going to counter Salesman Shane by saying, hey, do you know for a third of the price...
873829	877871	of the 3DS, you could be playing Grand Theft Auto 5 in the VOG Club right now.
877911	878291	Or Rob.
878671	878871	What?
879371	882232	You could go the free route and play Borderlands 2 with me.
882813	884694	Yeah, play the games I already have, right?
884754	885194	Yeah.
885494	886754	How about being frugal?
887735	889876	Let's hear it for fiscal responsibility.
891553	899960	Alright, going to our chat room for some comments at live.vognetwork.com Bobby Blackwolf says, Irene deserves your 3DS more than you deserve Pokemon.
900540	901081	Hey, shut up.
901861	905644	Alpha Cananogram says, Sky, maybe she'll get you some Japanese street passes.
906325	915332	I actually told her because if there weren't chargers on the plane, I told her to turn the Wi-Fi off so that way she would save battery power would probably be the smart thing to do.
915632	918314	Do they even have the same plugs in Japan that we have here?
918334	918955	No.
919215	919996	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
938554	964197	if you haven't learned in the past 11 and a half years sometimes things come out of my mouth before I really think them through, DarkSakura the one who had to have the mod the little plug mod was Jessica because of her APS2 that had the different plug on it Bobby, I would totally have played Borderlands 2 with you I've had my character ready to go for the longest time and no one's been playing
964662	965182	DarkSakura, way to go
988860	990040	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1010840	1030852	or you keep their stuff forever like my dance pad that you had for like a year it's fine if I really missed it I would ask for it back well it's like it's how I got my copy of Chrono Trigger my friend loaned it to me he moved to a Spanish fort and then I moved to California oops oops he hasn't asked for it back so it's fine didn't you get his save file is still on there
1031092	1031332	DarkSakura,
1052287	1053288	We went to Anime Expo.
1053328	1055689	She owed us $100 for her part of the room and the trip.
1056449	1056810	Oh, okay.
1056830	1057210	It was an exchange.
1057230	1058991	She went to Japan to go visit her family.
1059671	1061092	Came back with Dracula X for us.
1062072	1063193	She already had two copies.
1063493	1064054	Got it.
1065554	1066755	I thought that was like a loaning story.
1066795	1068816	Okay, but that was exchanged for convention space.
1068876	1069216	I got you.
1069256	1070337	That was trade for goods.
1070817	1071158	I don't know.
1071178	1074679	I loan out my games all the time and I forget I loan people stuff.
1075160	1077101	Right now, I don't think I have anything loaned out, but...
1078533	1079774	I could very well.
1079894	1082675	Okay, I have another hilarious loaning somebody a game story.
1082735	1087337	Okay, so Flaco Jones, I think it was, and I'm sorry if I'm calling you out and it wasn't really you.
1087918	1091319	I loaned him a copy of Silent Hill 4 The Room on Xbox.
1091479	1092380	At least I think it was him.
1093080	1095641	And it got passed back.
1095681	1096842	I know you had it for forever.
1097042	1097762	I had it for a while.
1097842	1100164	And then I loaned it to... I think it was Flog.
1100204	1101324	It might have been Extover, though.
1101345	1102045	It was one of them.
1102825	1107768	And they gave it back to Irene because they were like, well, Irene's going to see you next before I do.
1108329	1110970	And so, funny enough, when's the next time I see Irene?
1111250	1112631	When we're all at a party.
1113472	1113832	And then...
1114532	1117414	They give me the game back and I'm like, yay, here's my game back.
1117454	1122058	I can go take this home and not play it because like my original Xbox is like in storage at this point.
1122098	1125500	I don't even, I mean, I guess it's backwards compatible on 360, but let's be real.
1125901	1129243	I don't have like an anchoring to play Silent Hill 4 The Room anytime soon.
1129603	1130544	So what did I do, guys?
1131565	1133386	I left the game at the party.
1133586	1136368	I didn't even bring it home.
1137089	1140932	I'm pretty sure that game has been sold by this point.
1141452	1142613	So this is funny.
1142833	1144374	You can borrow mine if ever you want to play it.
1145115	1146275	Now that I actually have it.
1147096	1151218	I don't really like, like if I was going to go back and play a Silent Hill game, I think I'd go play 2 or 3.
1151899	1154721	I loaned actually my 3 to my friend Carly.
1155141	1156902	You remember, you've met Carly, haven't you?
1157523	1161185	The one who says the best rendition of the C-bomb ever.
1161805	1162186	Oh my.
1162446	1164567	She makes it sound like it's fucking poetry.
1165608	1170031	But at any rate, she had my Silent Hill 3 for a long time and I think I have it back.
1170051	1170551	I don't know.
1172734	1179121	Yeah, usually it's people that I will... Julie has borrowed stuff of mine and never given it back.
1179161	1180322	And then she'll say, oh, that was mine.
1180362	1180682	I bought that.
1180982	1181883	No, that was not yours.
1181983	1182804	Here's the fucking receipt.
1182884	1185247	I like that you're calling people out here on the show.
1185647	1186528	She's not listening though, right?
1186568	1187229	No, she's not listening.
1188550	1188970	DarkSakura
1214420	1218464	Okay, well, I played Mass Effect 3 because Tiara started playing Mass Effect.
1219265	1220806	And I was like, oh, Mass Effect.
1220846	1224229	So I started playing and spent more time screen capping than playing the game.
1225350	1228393	And then I played Animal Crossing.
1228413	1230735	I played a lot of Animal Crossing because I'm trying to get my tan back.
1231836	1231976	And...
1233933	1238455	I've played Fractal and I've played Final Fantasy XIV, which I still play at the same time so I can run dungeons.
1239236	1245659	And then a lot, a lot of Bejeweled on my phone.
1246320	1246880	On your phone?
1246960	1247300	On my phone.
1247320	1248721	Is that the Blitz version where you try to do it?
1248741	1249481	No, I don't play Blitz.
1249761	1249982	Oh, okay.
1250022	1252483	I play the stupid Butterfly mode and Diamond Mine mode.
1252523	1253303	What is Butterfly?
1253703	1254524	I'm so out of the loop.
1254764	1255325	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
1277609	1279310	Alright, is that it for your gaming week?
1279851	1302510	Yes Alright, well before we get to Loki's gaming week We're going to cut in here because it's about that time We are going to go to the phones right now And talk to Mike Kennedy He is with Retro Which is a Kickstarter that's going on right now For a throwback video game magazine As in like a print magazine And let's see if we get him on the line Hi Mike, you there?
1303070	1303450	I'm here.
1303510	1304010	How's it going?
1304110	1304570	Good.
1304690	1305791	Welcome to Orange Lounge Radio.
1305831	1306311	How are you?
1306671	1307231	I'm doing great.
1307251	1307991	Thanks for having me on.
1308251	1309751	No problem whatsoever.
1309891	1312132	So tell us a little bit about your Kickstarter.
1312152	1314933	You're behind this Kickstarter for a new magazine, Retro, right?
1315633	1316053	Yeah, yeah.
1316073	1318233	This is something that has come about pretty quick.
1318713	1326035	I've actually had the idea of adding content to a gaming auction site that I've run called Game Gavel for about, I don't know, maybe two years now.
1326195	1326375	Mm-hmm.
1326975	1334922	and we originally were bringing on some writers and we were doing just online content, kind of an editorial side of the website.
1335382	1339506	And then one of my writers said, Mike, have you ever thought about doing a digital magazine?
1339546	1342368	And I thought, well, hell no, I've never really thought about doing a digital magazine.
1343649	1350175	Only because I've never, I mean, personally, I don't have digital magazines on my iPad and I don't know how many people really do.
1351656	1354999	But we're hoping, obviously, that it's something that people are doing more and more of.
1356339	1361661	But then I got the idea after hooking up with another guy, Mark Kaminski, who's our layout and design guy.
1362162	1363202	He said, let's go for it.
1363242	1364923	Let's do it both.
1364943	1366423	Let's do print and digital.
1367163	1371705	And this was maybe two and a half weeks ago, maybe three weeks ago, TOPS.
1372706	1381589	And since he's come on board, he works for just this really large media company, and he does magazine layout and design for tons of other magazines.
1382309	1396116	and he basically wanted to contribute to the project and just basically came on board and has just really, I just have to say kicked ass because he designed that video force that we're using on the Kickstarter page.
1397377	1403400	He designed kind of a preview layout of the magazine and he's just kind of done this all really, really fast.
1403460	1408962	So he was sort of the missing link in the idea of doing whether it was a digital or a print magazine.
1408982	1409723	So this...
1410283	1410924	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1430369	1440743	Not only writers from maybe the past five to ten years, but going back and really digging deep into the history of video game journalism and going out and just kind of recruiting.
1441203	1444588	Right now we've got over three decades of video game journalists.
1444628	1445289	So no matter...
1445689	1457373	You know, when anybody kind of grew up gaming or what your decade of gaming was, whether it was the, you know, late 70s, early to mid 80s, the 90s or today, you're probably going to recognize some of the contributors that we're going to have on the magazine.
1457393	1461314	So I had to assemble this team really in about a week's time, you know.
1462154	1471077	I called Jeremy Parrish and I go, Jeremy, you know, gave me tons and tons of great information about, you know, compensation, you know, in this day and age and what you kind of need to pay.
1471097	1471738	Right.
1471798	1471918	And...
1473318	1484929	And I've got quite a few connections in the industry already, just running Game Gavel for the last six years and kind of living in Southern California, kind of the hotbed of developer and publisher activity.
1484949	1490254	I've got a lot of friends that are developers and publishing executives and stuff like that.
1491794	1503697	It just sort of, the plans just sort of aligned very quickly on this thing, and I was able to assemble pretty much kind of a who's who of gaming journalists to bring them in on this, and lo and behold, everybody thought it was a great idea.
1504717	1511359	In fact, a lot of them said that they've all had ideas for doing something like this, but just never done it yet.
1511579	1522106	So it's kind of one of those, it almost sounds like it's like, I don't know, like they bring in everything together, like the Voltron or something of these writers.
1522566	1531552	And that's why I expressed surprise a minute ago is that, wow, this thing's only three weeks old because, you know, you go over to the Kickstarter page and I'm scrolling and scrolling and scrolling and scrolling.
1531992	1539456	and it's, you know, this big list of people and I'm like, wow, you got your little Team America together, well, Team Worldwide, really, together in like three weeks.
1539516	1540257	That's pretty stunning.
1540337	1546220	I didn't really make it through the bottom of the page because I stopped to look at Sean Baby's hair and I was just like, what is going on there?
1546920	1547921	I don't understand this.
1548302	1548762	I don't either.
1548782	1550044	You know, I met him for the first time.
1550064	1555771	We were at the Portland Retro Gaming Expo last weekend, and he was up there, and we've been talking on the phone a lot.
1556772	1564182	But yeah, he's basically, that's pretty much it, you know, and I think he'll, sometimes that little mohawk's green and fluorescent green, sometimes it's orange.
1565022	1570266	I'm very jealous of him that it's not falling out because when you dye your hair that much, that's what's supposed to be happening.
1570286	1578032	But anyway, if you guys have a question for Mike with Retro Magazine Kickstarter, you can ask that live here in our chat room, live.vognetwork.com.
1578372	1582035	DarkSakura, I know you're dying to say something here because you've been studying print for a while.
1582195	1584056	This has to be tickling you, this whole idea, right?
1584196	1585457	Well, you had me at print.
1585517	1587859	I love the smell of CMYK fumes in the morning.
1588840	1589280	That's right.
1589785	1591586	I actually am a print designer.
1591606	1592487	How are you?
1593127	1595909	And I actually have just recently gone into contract writing.
1596930	1597070	Nice.
1597150	1599012	As in writing by contract.
1599512	1599872	Really?
1600132	1600813	Yes, I have.
1600933	1604836	So I find the whole thing just very fascinating.
1605236	1611240	I was wondering though where you happen to get other bits of inspiration from because I know that in the UK there's Retro Gamer.
1611740	1611941	Right.
1612041	1612541	Right now.
1612561	1612861	Yep.
1614122	1615904	Yeah, no, that's a great magazine.
1616044	1622009	I mean, if we can put together something half as good as that, I'd love it.
1623150	1629076	The thing that's so great about their magazine is they pack so much into it, and they throw it all together.
1630036	1648950	and like every spread every like you know two page spread will have like 10 different stories going on but yet they make it work you know what I mean and every time you read that magazine you see something new it doesn't matter how many times you pick it up or you know how old the magazine is I mean you're reading through it and you're like god I don't remember reading this you know the other 20 times I've flipped through the pages you know
1649230	1650611	Their design is so clever.
1650691	1657535	So I was thinking, I've thought for a while that we could use something like that geared toward a North American audience.
1657575	1660736	Because some of the machines they cover over there, we never got out over here.
1661417	1665019	But are you also planning on including some of the old import market?
1665179	1670022	Yeah, I tell you what, since we've launched the Kickstarter campaign, we have had...
1671082	1676163	Some great writers from around the world contact us and want to be a part of this.
1676843	1677663	Also in the US.
1677763	1679864	I mean, that's why this list keeps growing.
1679924	1687205	I mean, when I first started out with this, I had like Jeremy, Sean, Kat.
1687945	1689385	You know, we went after Bob Mackie.
1689505	1694246	Of course, the doors opened to him, but he had some other things that might get in the way, he thought.
1694866	1695426	And a few others.
1695466	1697627	So I had like maybe 10 to 12 people.
1697987	1699907	And I think now we've grown to like over 20 people.
1700627	1702508	because people just want to be a part of this.
1702648	1708152	It's almost like they're not doing it for the money, of course, because right now it's so segmented.
1708172	1708832	We have so many people.
1708852	1712674	It's not like any one of them is going to be submitting so many things.
1712714	1715396	A lot of these people are going to be submitting maybe one or two columns.
1716316	1724680	that are recurring, while we have others that might do a feature article, an interview if we want them to do that, or some assignment-type work.
1724700	1733604	But yeah, to answer the question, we've had a couple of folks in Japan send me some of their work, and they're journalists and podcasters over there.
1734144	1736105	We've had someone in the UK.
1736145	1737306	We had somebody in Germany.
1737946	1740747	And the deal is, I mean, I'm basically...
1742408	1752192	We'd love to have import information in here, whether it's current gen or retro and classic information, because those areas had huge influences, even on the gaming here in the United States.
1753133	1766438	And it's sort of like, I don't know what your first introduction was to Japanese gaming, but the TurboGrafx for me when I was little was sort of that strange, mystical console that played Japanese games.
1767018	1770180	And then I guess the Neo Geo kind of came in and
1771420	1774662	I guess maybe right after that or pretty damn near about the same time, I guess.
1774702	1776523	But, you know, it's always just weird.
1776583	1781706	And seeing these games, you know, was just totally, you know, mind-blowing to see what they were doing over there.
1781746	1782867	So there's some great history there.
1783267	1785168	And we really want to cover all the bases in retro.
1785248	1786489	I mean, you know, all the bases.
1786849	1787990	So that personally makes me happy.
1788010	1793134	I guess you could imagine my delight when I married someone who had a turbo duo and an EOGO.
1793514	1795255	Oh, yeah.
1795696	1799118	I always like to ask this question of Kickstarter folks when they come on the show.
1800439	1802201	You have this Kickstarter behind the campaign.
1802561	1807144	I think it's kind of obvious that the money is probably being raised because you actually have to print the magazine.
1807164	1808105	That doesn't come for free.
1808145	1811928	But what is it you're specifically raising the money to do in this process?
1812108	1813849	mainly actually paying the writers.
1814329	1815590	You know, these guys don't come cheap.
1816231	1821434	And, you know, my original budget was about $6,000 per issue.
1822075	1824616	You know, and if we got six issues, there's $36,000 right there, right?
1824736	1825037	Right.
1826217	1827919	And then, of course, we do have printing costs.
1827979	1833262	Now, Mark, being in the industry, you know, Mark commits to my layout and design guy, he's got some great contacts.
1833282	1836104	And we've really got our printing costs in check.
1836304	1838005	I mean, we've got them way low.
1838145	1841007	Even if we could even get up to, and this is sort of maybe a lofty goal right now,
1843229	1844610	A total of 10,000 print issues.
1844670	1850494	It drops down to about 90 cents an issue or a print.
1851035	1856739	Right now, it's going to be a minimum of 52 pages, a high-gloss page, and we're going to do a thick stock cover.
1856759	1858961	Do you guys remember Next Generation magazine?
1859241	1859562	I do.
1859942	1860142	Yeah.
1860162	1865810	I mean, one of the last greatest magazines, at least as far as I'm concerned, you know, and they always had that thick cover.
1865830	1872680	And I've still got, you know, I think the first two years, even their premier issue up in my closet because I just can't throw them away.
1872700	1873601	They're just too nice.
1873701	1874482	And they're a resource.
1874963	1875163	and so on.
1894394	1898236	Um, you know, and, uh, just, just something that's going to kind of be a resource.
1898877	1907542	And, uh, Mark, you know, being the great guy is, you know, we're, we're, we put an update in there about, you know, using environmentally conscious, you know, materials and everything, soy inks and, and recyclable paper.
1907582	1909042	But the thing is going to look beautiful.
1909783	1909863	Um,
1910464	1913508	Those are all things that we're thinking about.
1913989	1921039	Thanks to Mark for coming on and being in the industry and knowing where to go and putting this whole thing together.
1921500	1923783	The magazine is going to look as good as anything you've ever seen.
1923803	1925506	I can guarantee you that with him on board this thing.
1925686	1925806	Yeah.
1953689	1954470	Yeah, well, for sure.
1954530	1956531	I mean, every magazine is going to cover everything.
1956571	1958273	It's going to be heavily weighted with retro, of course.
1958933	1966940	Certainly any current generation games or gaming, you know, topics that have some sort of a historical background or relevance we want to talk about.
1967981	1969082	You know, we're kind of going back and forth.
1969102	1972464	That's not to say we won't, you know, review AAA titles.
1972865	1978209	But, I mean, what's the point of reviewing, you know, Call of Duty 12 if every other magazine and every other website is already doing it?
1978229	1978710	You know what I mean?
1978730	1979070	Right.
1979190	1981252	And so, you know, like I said...
1981952	1986233	You may or may not see those types of things reviewed.
1986293	1989014	Typically, we're going to hopefully look for stuff that kind of flies under the radar.
1989034	1995275	Certainly, the indie stuff is big right now, and there's tons of innovation there, even on the retro side and mobile.
1996155	2001396	So you can expect console, mobile, indie, PC gaming, arcade and pinball.
2001436	2004337	We got Kevin Steele in there from Game Room Magazine going to bring up that end of it.
2006007	2006507	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2025637	2026578	You know, we don't really know.
2026638	2030039	We know it's going to be a minimum of 52 pages and only four pages of ads.
2030059	2035502	So we want to keep it, you know, lots of in-depth features and stuff and minimal on the ad space.
2036702	2039024	But, you know, right now we've got so many people.
2039984	2042345	The trick for us is going to be, you know, how do we juggle everybody?
2042385	2043546	Is everybody in every issue?
2044386	2046547	Are some people staggered, you know, every other issue?
2047388	2048888	Or do we just simply add more pages?
2048928	2050309	And honestly, that's what we'd want to do.
2051189	2060911	and I think we get up, you know, if we can get up over, you know, to the 60s, you know, our goal is 50,000, which really is what we've budgeted as sort of a break-even point to produce six 52-page issues.
2061331	2074754	So if we can go, you know, if we can get up to 60,000, 70,000, we'd like to add, you know, another four pages, you know, four-page increments, of course, and get up to 60 pages and, you know, maybe get into the 80 to 90-page range, maybe before the year's over.
2076475	2079677	There will be no shortage of content, I'll tell you that.
2081238	2085581	These guys are already coming up with some great ideas, things they're going to be writing about.
2085961	2090024	I'm just as excited as everybody else to be reading what all these people have to say.
2090044	2091185	You're just putting this all together.
2091245	2093126	You can't wait to read it yourself, I think.
2094127	2094527	I can't.
2094567	2095548	I really can't.
2095588	2098069	I grew up gaming in the 70s.
2098109	2102672	Electronic Games, the first magazine dedicated to the hobby back in the early 80s.
2105274	2111858	I also remember, I was really fond of, my first gaming system, and I'm using my quotey fingers, was really a Commodore 64, so I remember...
2125385	2133991	I remember the magazines that were like the really nice glossy pages in the beginning and the back was more like newspaper because it was all the type these into your computer to get these games type of thing.
2134011	2137353	Yeah, I've got a Commodore 64 set up here in the home arcade.
2137373	2145238	Yeah, I mean, it's, you know, I collect, you know, that's part of the reason I started Game Gavel, the auction site back in 08, which is to give gamers a better place to buy and sell.
2145318	2147840	It's a lot cheaper than eBay, free listings, free seller stores.
2147880	2149301	We got tons of great sellers on there.
2150421	2159586	And the plan, and we're not going to bombard people with game gavel in the magazine, but on the digital side, well, first off, everybody that buys the print subscription is going to get digital for free, okay?
2159606	2161227	So you're going to be able to kind of get both.
2162448	2166069	The digital magazines, we will have maybe just a shopping cart icon.
2166089	2168891	So if you're reading about a game, you know, we'll put a shopping cart on there.
2168911	2174774	If you click the shopping cart, it'll pull up the listings in the auction site for all the other gamers that are selling that game.
2174794	2175094	Right.
2175895	2178197	and bringing people into the marketplace to buy and sell.
2178397	2183141	So that's kind of the plan, kind of integrating the commerce with the content, at least with the digital.
2183161	2186545	I was going to say a little bit of synergy between your different projects, but that's smart.
2186705	2188106	I mean, there's nothing wrong with that.
2188546	2194232	If you guys want to consider donating to Retro, the throwback video game magazine, you can find that on Kickstarter.
2194472	2200818	It's at kickstarter.com slash project slash SoCalMike, but it's probably easier to just go to kickstarter.com and search for Retro.
2201238	2203881	Retro, some of the different various award tiers.
2203921	2207986	You can actually get for $7 the premiere issue of Retro.
2208086	2215574	If you want to look at a six-issue one-year digital subscription, you can kick back $12 for that.
2215594	2217636	DarkSakura, you said the magic P word, pinball?
2217657	2217757	Yeah.
2222882	2228026	So, that actually really, my husband and I collect pinball tables.
2228426	2228747	Oh, right.
2229027	2230468	And we're down to three.
2231809	2233510	But we have a Twilight Zone, so that's what matters.
2234151	2235291	What else do you guys have?
2235351	2239615	We have World Cup Soccer 94, which was my favorite, and Jackbot.
2240315	2240936	Oh, right, yeah.
2240956	2243537	We actually got rid of No Fear for Jackbot.
2245920	2248543	We actually have hung out a few times with Steve Ritchie.
2249384	2250145	Yeah, we know Steve.
2250305	2251306	He's such a great guy.
2251526	2252247	Oh, yeah.
2252547	2253328	And he does the voices.
2253368	2256031	That's so amazing.
2256592	2261998	What I was wondering about the pinball is if you were going to be doing interviews with Stern and covering some of the newer...
2262819	2267020	Yeah, I mean, I know Stern real well.
2267040	2268381	We know Jersey Jack real well.
2269501	2272642	You know, they just came out with Wizard of Oz and they're working, I think, on their second table now.
2273942	2280124	So, yeah, I mean, anytime there's a new table out, we want to do, you know, an in-depth review of that thing and, you know, interview the designers behind it.
2281105	2289090	We've just, we've got great, you know, again, I've just got some great, great contacts going back, you know, through the years and everything.
2289371	2293273	And we do Retro Gaming Roundup podcast for about six years.
2293333	2299678	And every one of those shows, we do a one to two hour interview with somebody, you know, famous, some old gaming, you know, god.
2300258	2305722	We did Al Alcorn and Ted Dabney, all the Activision guys, Steve, I mean, some of the pinball folks.
2305782	2307784	I mean, it goes on and on and on.
2308024	2311347	DarkTetsuya in our chatroom says, out of all the names you got involved, who were you the most excited to get on board?
2336127	2339710	Um, boy, I would have to say, if I could answer to, well, I don't know.
2339730	2344515	I'd have to say Jeremy Parrish because, you know, Jeremy is, is such a consummate professional.
2344695	2346377	He's just, he's a great writer.
2346918	2348620	Um, and people love Jeremy.
2348760	2350922	You know, there's just something about him that everybody loves.
2351703	2352884	Um, uh,
2353124	2355267	I hate to single anybody out.
2355347	2367301	I mean, Sean Baby, Chris Kohler, Jeff Green, Andy Eddy, for God's sakes, Cat Bailey, Ryan Scott, Leonard Herman, a big historian in the industry that writes just these great books.
2367682	2371226	What I'm excited about having Lenny on board is he writes some of them.
2371586	2373028	Are you familiar with Lenny Herman?
2375043	2378245	The name doesn't ring a bell, but it's probably one of those things when you tell me what he did, I'll be like, yes.
2395173	2403641	But, you know, if you can write, you know, four or five, six pages on a particular topic, you know, I think kids will read it and really learn something about the industry.
2403661	2404661	And that's what we really want to do.
2404701	2409826	We want to sort of preserve the past and kind of look back and understand, you know, why the industry is what it is.
2409866	2414330	I mean, God, when it started, everybody thought it was going to be a fad, I remember, back in the 70s and the 80s, you know.
2414350	2416631	Nobody knew it was going to be around for another 30 years.
2417432	2428862	I really love reading the stories from the time when people were developing for the Atari 2600 when it just sounded like it was so much pressure and it was like one or two people and it's such a different type of culture than what we see now.
2428902	2431264	We had two days to make Pac-Man.
2431404	2434446	I'm always fascinated by that and really how it's grown into these.
2434526	2439631	Now you look at a game like Grand Theft Auto V and it's like shooting five movies all at the same time.
2440451	2442514	Yeah, it's really insane.
2442594	2443295	It's really insane.
2443375	2444557	But yeah, I'd have to say Jeremy.
2444577	2447941	I was really glad to get him on more, but not to just pick anybody.
2448162	2451646	I'm just loving everybody that we've assembled into this thing so far.
2452087	2455211	And a lot of them have asked to get involved with it after the fact.
2455651	2455852	Nice.
2456272	2462254	which is great, which just sort of, I think, just led some credibility to the idea of everybody wants to be a part of this thing.
2462534	2471837	And getting all of this wisdom and history packed into the pages of a single magazine has never been done before.
2472078	2475779	Even on a website, there's not been a writing team like this assembled.
2476379	2478040	So it's just a special thing.
2478320	2481221	And I think we've got a long way to go.
2481281	2481861	I mean, we're
2482361	2484683	You know, around 35% of goal right now.
2485903	2488345	But, you know, we've got 20 days to go.
2488365	2490827	That sounds like a long time, but the days kind of keep ticking away.
2490847	2493608	And I keep thinking to myself, you know, the trend has kind of been down.
2493628	2494989	But I've talked to people who run Kickstarters.
2495009	2497031	I don't know if you guys know anybody or run any yourself.
2497051	2501013	But it sounds like there's a little bit of a kind of a smile where it kind of dips and goes down.
2501033	2505176	And then, you know, people just wait because, you know, I wait a lot of times on Kickstarters.
2505196	2507397	I'll wait till the last few days or the last week, you know.
2507418	2510980	And then, you know, there's a big kind of surge of people kind of that last week.
2511660	2537592	and so we kind of hope it goes that way I think the internet is kind of a funky place too where you kind of have to just catch that wave at the right moment where it hits and it goes viral and then it's spreading everywhere and then that's where your Kickstarter is really going to take off so I hope I'm not going to profess to be a very large organization here at Orange Launch Radio or the Voice of Geeks Network but I hope we can do what we can here by having you on tonight to bring awareness to it and maybe cause a little bit of an uptick with that
2538352	2542873	Again, if you guys want to look at retro, you can check that out at kickstarter.com.
2542914	2545514	And I am also happy to spread the word around the pinball circles.
2546134	2547095	Yeah, please do.
2547115	2551056	I mean, we want to definitely have some pinball content in every issue.
2552356	2554217	I think there's plenty of things to talk about.
2554915	2555916	I like the special edition Tron.
2578999	2586336	Before I let Mike go, Mike, we always ask our guests this when they come on the show, and it may have nothing to do with the project that you're talking about, but we are a video game show.
2586376	2588781	We want to know what kind of games are you playing this week?
2590581	2591121	Oh, my gosh.
2591141	2596764	Well, I just picked up a Missile Command cocktail table here on the Craigslist here in L.A.
2597644	2598445	for a whopping $140.
2598665	2598725	Wow.
2598845	2600145	Really super cheap.
2600466	2601886	For a cocktail table, that's great.
2602326	2602907	Oh, my gosh.
2602927	2607209	I mean, everybody, I got friends all over the country, and you guys are in L.A., right, or Southern California?
2607289	2609590	We're in Sacramento, so we're about six hours north of you, yeah.
2610630	2611931	I drove up there.
2611971	2615513	I drove to Portland and spent a night on the way up in SAC.
2616393	2620896	I don't know what it is up north, but down here it's just sort of like a feeding frenzy.
2621937	2625879	My friends are going nuts because I find such great deals like on Craigslist.
2625899	2626860	They're like, Missile Command, $140?
2626920	2629241	That would have been $500 in Virginia.
2630642	2635084	So yeah, I just picked that up and I've been playing some... What was I playing today?
2635104	2638406	I think Gradius 5 on the PS2.
2638526	2639127	Great game.
2639927	2644952	I've got a little man cave down here, kind of home office, where I've got four arcade games.
2644992	2646814	I've got a Touchmaster hooked up.
2646834	2648996	I've got an Apple IIc, and my Commodore's hooked up.
2649056	2652539	I've got about 90 Commodore cartridges, and I play that all the time.
2652920	2655823	So you don't just talk the talk with this retro stuff.
2655863	2657184	You walk the walk as well.
2657745	2659426	Yeah, no, man.
2659486	2659867	I'm in deep.
2659887	2661688	Thank God my wife loves to play games as well.
2662369	2664270	That's how my husband and I got together.
2664630	2666471	Last thing here, DarkSakura, you had one more thing?
2667992	2673275	I actually was just thinking of... Imagine if our two vaults combined.
2673776	2675297	It would totally explode the world.
2675697	2678318	DarkSakura and her hubby have a huge gaming vault as well.
2681260	2682321	I want to go play all this stuff now.
2682361	2685823	But you were actually asking a little bit about what the market is up here.
2686183	2688604	For a lot of the retro games, they're actually quite expensive.
2689265	2689365	And...
2689605	2689985	DarkSakura.com
2701280	2702660	Right, yeah.
2702680	2703681	Well, that's one of the greats.
2704041	2704601	Yeah.
2704641	2706081	And we could get more if we wanted it.
2706321	2707801	Well, I've got to wrap up and let Mike go.
2707861	2709422	Mike, thanks so much for your time here tonight.
2709442	2710062	Thank you guys so much.
2710102	2713082	I really appreciate the opportunity to tell your listeners about this.
2713242	2713783	No worries.
2713883	2714963	And best of luck with the project.
2714983	2720224	You know, one thing I don't think I really got out there during the interview is that we love that you're taking an indie approach to it.
2720884	2723144	We've always been fiercely independent here at Orange Lawn Trader.
2723164	2724845	You know, we've been doing what we do here since 2002.
2724945	2726885	Yeah, amazing.
2727605	2728746	For, you know, 11 plus years.
2728766	2730506	Before a podcast even was a podcast.
2731687	2735489	Yes, actually, yeah, we were a live 365 show for a couple years before that.
2735509	2736970	We tell all the kids to get off our lawn.
2737110	2741512	But yeah, I mean, we love that you guys are keeping it independent with this.
2741592	2750117	Even if you are bringing in people who are kind of paid behind the big budget stuff, you're kind of at least getting them outside of that element for this indie production.
2750157	2751198	I think that's fantastic.
2751298	2751558	It's great.
2751738	2753279	I don't know what they're going to be writing about.
2769470	2772933	We'll obviously kind of nail some of that down as we move forward to building the first issue.
2772973	2783222	But I really think that they're going to talk about things and write maybe just a little bit differently in this environment than they would normally write working for Future US or IGN or one of these big companies.
2783702	2789948	So I'm just really excited to kind of give them the freedom to kind of write what they want to write about, how they want to write.
2790468	2794452	A new side of some of your favorite video game authors.
2795873	2796774	Hey, one last thing, too.
2796794	2800157	Speaking of Live365, I also do RetroArcadeRadio.com.
2800197	2806402	It's just 24 hours a day, live streaming retro gaming-related music and old vintage commercials.
2806903	2808424	I know you guys are interested in that.
2808464	2809105	It's been going on.
2809485	2811567	I've been running that for about five or six years as well.
2811947	2816271	So RetroArcadeRadio.com, but it's a Live365 station as well.
2817873	2821516	They served a great purpose for us for many years until we decided to branch out.
2821857	2823138	But yeah, that's awesome.
2823358	2829545	That sounds like a great thing to do when you're playing your Commodore 64 with 90 cartridges and all this other crazy stuff you have.
2829625	2830686	So that's awesome.
2830706	2832308	Well, best of luck with your various projects.
2832849	2834911	That's retroarcadegameradio.com?
2835450	2836471	Retro Arcade Radio.
2836631	2837892	RetroArcadeRadio.com.
2837913	2838133	Okay.
2838333	2846581	So you got RetroArcadeRadio.com, GameGavel.com, and soon Retro Game Magazine or whatever domain you get for this.com as well.
2846601	2847481	You're a busy guy, Mike.
2847622	2848823	Best of luck with all your projects.
2849163	2849724	Thank you so much.
2849764	2851826	Thank you for taking the time out to be with us here at OLR tonight.
2851886	2852646	Have a great night.
2853107	2853447	Bye, guys.
2853467	2854028	Bye-bye.
2855325	2856466	Wow, that was awesome.
2856847	2857948	He should be our new best friend.
2860551	2862073	You want to be his best friend.
2862193	2862694	No, I liked him.
2862734	2863515	He seemed well enough.
2863575	2866918	But you guys definitely have the retro pinball, that same-sames there.
2866938	2868260	Well, at the moment he said pinball.
2868280	2869762	I was like, bing!
2869882	2875528	Well, you don't get any of that in any of the current publications, really, unless it's specifically pinball.
2876389	2895796	and I mean especially now with you know for example that Wizard of Oz table has such a heavy video element with it that or all the pinball 2000 that had the screens you're dealing with a pinball and video game you know a digital game combined that isn't baby pac-man
2896797	2897818	But I still love Baby Pac-Man.
2897838	2898759	I still love Baby Pac-Man.
2898839	2899880	I love me some Baby Pac-Man.
2899940	2901101	Alright, best of luck to those guys.
2901201	2903283	One more time, you can search for that on Kickstarter.com.
2903323	2906426	It is retro and I'll probably contribute a little bit for that effort.
2906706	2913712	I think it's a fine idea they've got over there and I would not mind having some more magazines to put on the shelves here.
2913732	2915574	Maybe this will take my Kickstarter virginity.
2916275	2916915	Ooh, okay.
2917756	2919076	That's right, you've never donated to a Kickstarter.
2919096	2922077	Well, because my Amazon payments weren't working every time I freaking tried.
2922537	2923337	All right.
2923537	2945645	By the way, before we move on to the rest of our gaming weeks, I did want to point out over in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com, there was a lot of other chatter that weren't just questions for Mike, but there was talk going on there about some other gaming magazine memories, and we're going to get into that with our Fugo question of the week later, but I did want to point out for DarkSakra, Codeman was offering to go get high with you on some CMYK fumes.
2946047	2948868	Oh yeah, I think I actually started that.
2949309	2949909	There you go.
2951269	2961514	I'm sorry, if you are a print design person, there is no smell as wonderful as stepping into a print shop and smelling the toxic fumes.
2961994	2967237	I have to tell you that traditional ink smells a lot different than the soy ink, and I don't know what I like better.
2968578	2969038	Just saying.
2969358	2972539	Have you smelled a print shop on weed?
2974119	2977983	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2991678	3015141	to my PS3 character so I managed to get up to level 10 on my 360 character and then I decided well one night I was trying to play with Bobby but he kept getting stuck in like full games and I couldn't join his game so I ended up just going back to single player and trying to finish my 100% stuff so that's what I've been doing since earlier this week and I'm now 80
3018620	3019701	2% complete, I think.
3020021	3024604	I'm pretty much almost done with the Epsilon program missions.
3026785	3027626	What else did I do?
3027786	3030628	Oh, I finished all the triathlons.
3032109	3033249	Seriously, Rockstars?
3033430	3033970	Seriously?
3034010	3037072	There's a 30-minute fucking long triathlon?
3037112	3043036	30 minutes in real time of Mashing A. Mashing A for 30 fucking minutes.
3043056	3044777	That sounds about as awesome as Desert Bus.
3045609	3052852	I mean, that is so fucking... Oh, it's almost as fun as the part in Epsilon Missions where you have to run for five miles.
3053492	3056573	So I was sitting there running in circles for about 20 minutes.
3057454	3058074	That was fun.
3059014	3061515	Also mashing A for like a while.
3062696	3063256	And then what else?
3063776	3070579	So all the races and... I think I'm pretty much... I'm buying property and...
3071639	3078165	I don't know, pretty much I just have to do a lot of the collectibles and stunt jumps and the planes under the bridges and stuff.
3078585	3081948	So I have to finish that, and I think that'll be about it.
3082809	3084810	Not much left to go, but I'm going to still work on that.
3085090	3090055	But later this week, though, we are going to be doing two VOG gaming nights for Grand Theft Auto Online.
3090655	3093678	One day on PlayStation 3, one day on Xbox 360.
3093718	3093758	So...
3095299	3112226	stay tuned in the forums, I'm thinking right now that it's going to be Friday, Saturday I just have to make sure it doesn't conflict with any shows that's about it as long as it's not Saturday night when USL is on, you should be good if you do it a little earlier in the night Saturday should be fine
3112714	3113315	Thanks for watching!
3133317	3134538	So I'm going to get caught up this week.
3134918	3139619	I did play a little bit of Final Fantasy XIV, not as much as you'd think based on what I said last week.
3140280	3145201	I was fortunate enough to get into Hearthstone Beta, which is Blizzard's free-to-play trading card game.
3146002	3148162	I talked a little bit about this at length on Horde House.
3148342	3149663	I'll kind of repeat some of that here.
3150523	3165889	I did enjoy the game well enough especially for something that's free to play I found the gameplay to be a little bit basic but some card game aficionados who know this stuff a little more than I do seem to really enjoy it and kind of find the depth in it that I'm currently I guess not seeing or whatever
3166489	3173134	I was really surprised that you draw so few cards and it's really like the mana's all just kind of built in.
3173154	3175155	You don't have cards on your own for that or whatever.
3175996	3179619	But I guess the easy to play thing is really to try to draw in as many people as possible.
3180199	3185423	And kind of my final verdict on Hearthstone from what I've played on it so far is that I think it's going to be a great tablet game.
3185743	3186844	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3204494	3205215	Audio Surf 2 Audio Surf 1
3226870	3228131	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3246826	3247166	Remember that?
3247206	3251628	Where they come down the conveyor belt, the colored pieces will come down the conveyor belt and you try to match three, match five.
3251928	3254789	You kind of tried to do that really quick in AudioSurf.
3255249	3273235	But AudioSurf had a mode that I thought was way better called the mono mode where it was just pick up, you know, the pieces are black or white and it's just about navigating and being able to move through the field as fast as possible so you pick up only the pieces that are colorful and not the pieces that are, you know, the wrong color.
3274276	3275297	I like that mode the best.
3290271	3307635	because what you can do is that like let's say you know you're about to go down a big hill because when the tempo of the song picks up you start to go down a hill well what you do is you swing your character all the way to a side the side of the tunnel and click the mouse button and they'll like fly up in the air and then you're flying down the hill and you do tricks in the air
3308555	3331554	and then you kind of land like it's like like you're in like a jet ski type thing and you do these tricks I thought that was a really cool little innovation that's like I the way that plays and feels because you know that's when the crescendos of the music happens so to kind of do like this all like right when the crescendo of a big dance song hits like boom I'm gonna go flying in the air and do all these tricks like it's it's really rewarding in that sort of way so um
3332475	3335378	Yeah, I'm liking what I'm seeing of AudioSurf 2 so far.
3335698	3337980	I guess one of the other big things they're going to do with it is mods.
3338300	3340863	They want to have more and more mods and user-created stuff.
3340923	3345667	I imagine this is going to be a part of that Steam... What do they call it?
3345687	3352113	The Steam community marketplace or something like that where people can make their own stuff like they have with Skyrim and Civilization and stuff.
3352493	3355536	I can't imagine this game isn't going to incorporate that big time, so...
3356056	3357878	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3375211	3379975	I was on another show, the Let's Wow podcast last week, episode 31.
3380875	3381936	That is now on the feed.
3381976	3388321	But when I was talking about that, I forgot to plug Gemet's stream that he's doing this Tuesday on into Wednesday.
3388341	3392183	He's going to be doing a 24-hour live stream for charity.
3392223	3394325	He's raising money for Breast Cancer Awareness Month.
3394685	3395426	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3411640	3412601	Thanks for watching!
3436343	3437864	Twitter.com slash OLR.
3437944	3441828	We're also on Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
3443229	3444830	And I think that's it.
3445451	3446651	That's all I've got to plug right now.
3446712	3448153	So I guess we should get into some news.
3448313	3448573	Loki.
3449354	3449674	All right.
3450234	3455519	So let's talk a little bit about new devices coming out.
3456239	3473353	and you may remember we talked briefly about the Mojo which I think is pretty cool the Mad Catz micro console that's going to have Android games and stuff on it what's kind of unique about it is that it can actually play normal Android games it's not a separate marketplace you can actually map the controls and stuff
3474594	3478699	The only problem with it, though, is it's $250.
3479560	3480801	But, yeah, so they announced $250.
3481201	3482563	It's up for pre-order.
3482583	3485146	Ships in December, tentatively.
3486487	3488309	Some of the specs on it.
3489591	3494176	It's going to have 16 gigabytes of storage with microSD support.
3495036	3504818	Also, they have a 1.8GHz Tegra 4 processor, so it's definitely more powerful than, say, an Ouya.
3505618	3518621	And it comes with a special controller that's Bluetooth-enabled, which allows you to also use it on Android or as a PC controller, or even use mouse input and stuff.
3519741	3521863	Um, so that looks pretty cool.
3521983	3530548	And then one of the other cool things that you can do with this, and I guess it kind of helps warrant the $250 price point, is that you can actually stream PC games with it.
3531168	3533690	So that's going to be coming, I think, after it launches.
3534570	3538753	Um, and it's going to like... Wait a minute, Loki, isn't that supposed to be the Steam Machines thing?
3539894	3541955	Well, technically, yeah, I guess it could be.
3542475	3543256	But, um...
3544964	3546486	I think it's kind of cool.
3546506	3548188	Let's see, here's some more specs on the Mojo.
3548748	3555876	Two gigs of RAM and one USB 2.0 and one USB 3.0 port.
3556256	3557758	I mean, that's pretty cool that it supports that.
3557878	3560381	Bluetooth 4.0 and it's running Android 4.22.
3565134	3567615	I don't even have a headphone socket on there, so that's kind of cool.
3567635	3569655	You can listen to your audio through that.
3570915	3572595	I don't know.
3572615	3577156	I think for $250 and it can stream games to your TV, that's kind of cool.
3577616	3583238	If it was just strictly an Android box, that probably wouldn't be worth it for $250.
3583278	3586558	So, I don't know.
3586998	3589999	What do you think would make it worth the cost?
3590475	3595359	For $250, it's going to do a lot more than just play Android games, I think.
3596160	3597641	The controller looks nice, at least.
3598262	3609131	I guess a lot of people have their phones and stuff, and it would cost a lot less to probably just get an HDMI out on your phone or get some other type of streaming thing.
3609912	3617158	Since it does support Android, I suppose you could also use this as a box to watch Netflix or Hulu or anything like that on.
3617778	3642286	Oh yay, just my living room needs another Netflix device Because I don't have any of those Some people don't have a lot of stuff Or some people might want a second one Or a third or fourth or whatever And plus it looks kind of nice I mean it's shiny, it's got blue light on the front I don't normally purchase my consoles based on lights But it definitely looks better More lights Passed out 57 LEDs
3643885	3644125	I don't know.
3644145	3645246	I think the price point is a little expensive.
3645286	3647807	Maybe if it comes down in price later on, it might be worth it for me.
3648127	3651068	But I just don't need any more consoles right now.
3652109	3654050	But the controller looks nice.
3655710	3659212	I mean, if I could use it on 360 or PS3, I might be down with that.
3660512	3664453	All right, well, going to some stories about the Xbox One happening out there.
3664914	3672436	There was a lot of talk this week about, you know, there's been a lot of talk about the Kinect and privacy and all that.
3672476	3676418	You know, ever since they announced the whole always-on thing, there was the concerns about privacy.
3676718	3678379	Well, I don't think it's even necessarily that.
3678399	3684301	It's more ever since they announced all that stuff leaking out and, oh, Microsoft's in bed with the NSA type thing.
3684341	3684981	Well, yeah, yeah.
3685081	3693625	But, I mean, this isn't even really about that, but it's been on people's minds because of that ever since they announced the system, and this was kind of an interesting development on that this week.
3694305	3704489	I'm going to totally pronounce this name, so I apologize, but it's Yusuf Mehdi, who is the Corporate Vice President of Marketing and Strategy for Microsoft, was talking to the National Advertisers Masters of Marketing Conference.
3704509	3705750	This was happening in Phoenix last
3706130	3706830	Thanks for watching.
3706890	3707451	See you next time.
3728938	3733799	You know, it's making games out of advertising, like, you know, interactive flash type things.
3734519	3742181	The fact that, like, take a social app like Foursquare is gamifying social media by, you know, you check in, you get points, there's the mayorship, there's all that.
3742661	3745061	That's all gamification because games are fun.
3745601	3747242	Look at vognetwork.com.
3747742	3752163	Gamified a radio network of independent podcasts and kind of made a game out of that.
3752523	3753063	That's gamification.
3753103	3756987	or the catchpa ones where you have to park the car to get your catchpa.
3757087	3759690	Yes, which we actually use on vognetwork.com which is a fun one.
3760430	3763814	Or in reverse, the people who use their advertising as a catchpa.
3763934	3768939	Oh yeah, where you have to type in the name of the product or what product is blah blah blah.
3768959	3769760	Nike, just do it.
3769800	3771862	You have to type in the slogan or whatever.
3772302	3794121	But anyway, talking about also consolidating more attention that's diffused otherwise on multiple devices Xbox One will make it easier to port real-time fantasy football data into the TV screen as people watch their NFL games It does sound kind of interesting, I know some people that are really into fantasy football and I can sort of see that Wait, was a Kinect going to help do that?
3794966	3799149	Well, the Xbox One does that because it's that whole like... I was going to say, how is the Kinect supposed to do that?
3799309	3805153	But you can watch the TV in like the three quarters window and then around the edge kind of has your gamify or whatever.
3805173	3812598	Yeah, but I'm just trying to figure out how the Kinect is actually going to enhance something that basically I could feed into it normally.
3812658	3824806	I'm just saying, like, unless is it going to recognize that, you know, say I'm following, you know, my team of players because it knows my face and so that's going to display those stats and I don't know.
3825747	3833753	Well, anyway, some of this chat led people to believe that, oh, they're going to harvest ad data through the connect.
3834254	3837777	But Microsoft came out after all of this and said, hold on.
3837997	3840158	No, no, this is not what we're doing.
3841500	3844462	And yeah, it just said nobody is working on that.
3844482	3845783	That's not something that happened.
3845823	3848505	It is not going to happen without the user having control over it.
3849086	3849246	But
3849787	3850888	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3864144	3868687	but there's some people out there that have that distrust and question that corporate stuff.
3868707	3889021	It probably comes from the fact that there's all these dirty rumors out there of all these horrible things that Microsoft could possibly be doing and then they came out and said, yep, we're going to do all that and then Sony said, nope, we're not going to do all that and then Microsoft said, no, we're actually not going to do that now and we're not going to do that now and we're not going to do that now because you people don't like it.
3890061	3892683	But we may implement those features in the future.
3895885	3900008	You know, it's the whole flip-flopping that makes people kind of unwary about that stuff.
3901409	3905172	I think... I mean, what... I don't know.
3906173	3911777	I guess concerning would have been the features that, okay, we can recognize individual people.
3911817	3916781	We can cater ads based on those people that happen to be sitting in front of the screen.
3916801	3922645	We can recognize whether they're looking at the ad because we can see where their eyes are looking or something like that.
3922745	3923206	You know, or...
3924427	3926869	How long they're engaged in watching that kind of stuff.
3926889	3928471	Some of this has to do with patents too.
3928891	3939122	It causes a lot of buzz going on through because I remember when, wasn't it Microsoft that has that patent for it can detect who is actually watching the film and lock...
3939662	3940322	Thanks for watching!
3963587	3965868	But I seem to recall that was an issue like a year ago on the show.
3965888	3972691	But didn't they try doing gamification of stuff with Kinect and like these stupid interactive ads and stuff through Kinect on the Microsoft?
3973191	3979775	Well, it's funny you say that because TigerClawedChat at live.vognetwork.com says, you think they'll have achievements just for watching an ad?
3980875	3984937	And DarkSakura, you're responding to him in chat talking about Gaia Online, which kind of does something like that.
3985515	3989839	Yeah, you like get Gaia Gold for doing surveys and watching their stupid little ads.
3990279	3991680	I used to do Gaia back in the day.
3991760	3999186	Well, I think, okay, well, maybe Microsoft doesn't necessarily have that yet, but you got achievements from playing those Burger King games.
3999587	4002209	There was achievements in Yaris, which was an Adver game.
4002549	4004711	Burger King games were just genius.
4005211	4007152	Actually, yeah, the Burger King games were really like the greatest.
4007172	4014557	And I'm very disappointed that there's no new Burger King games because they were creepy in their own way and it was just, it was fun.
4015278	4024964	But besides all of that, I also think though that Microsoft has said there's going to be an achievement for like day one Xbox purchasing, like a day one adopter achievement.
4025205	4031529	So, I mean, that might not be advertising per se, but they are definitely willing to put achievements in things that are not games.
4031549	4031729	Right.
4033376	4033817	Well, they are.
4034337	4038383	I think they were talking about TV watching and stuff like that as part of an achievement.
4038423	4041067	Plus, remember now, Xbox rewards and stuff.
4041087	4043130	They give you rewards for doing different things.
4043491	4045914	Who's to say they couldn't give you rewards for watching ads?
4047253	4054936	Codeman in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, it's not that we need less marketing, it's that we need more less annoying marketing.
4055456	4057077	Well, let me ask this tough question.
4057617	4058317	What is that?
4058697	4061478	Then what is marketing that is not annoying?
4061998	4063319	I think that's a tough question to answer.
4063619	4070802	Because I think whenever a lot of people feel like they're being kind of like pandered to or marketed to, they might feel a little bit annoyed.
4070862	4071922	So what's not annoying?
4072583	4088219	I actually don't mind product placement in a game or in a movie as long as it's not obtrusive like you know the billboards and crazy taxis what I think of or take me to KFC you know like I didn't I wasn't annoyed with that I actually found it funny it was kind of funny
4088679	4104262	or you know it's stuff that you see in real life you know you're driving through the town you may see an ad for you know like a racing game they have all the Valvoline and Forelli and all that you know that's what you see at an actual racing track that's realistic advertising in the game
4105163	4113805	or, you know, for example, character walks into, you know, a snack room and goes to a Pepsi machine and gets a Diet Pepsi.
4114545	4116166	That's unobtrusive marketing.
4116366	4118086	That's something that would happen in real life.
4118146	4118666	It all depends.
4118726	4131449	I mean, I've seen people complain about that kind of stuff in, you know, games where they'll have, you know, Mountain Dew or something and it's like, it's the year 2205 or something ridiculous, you know, in the future and there's all these Mountain Dew machines everywhere.
4131969	4154257	I think like if you want to do I think people need to feel because right now they feel okay we're being charged for online and now we're also being advertised to at the same time because look at the PlayStation Network they don't really have ads all over the place on the PlayStation you know cross media bar there's not ads just I mean there's a little advertisement ticker thing in the corner we're talking about sales and stuff of games
4154577	4155337	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
4178823	4190051	You have Microsoft that's charging for online, Sony that's not charging for online, there's no ads there, and Microsoft, on top of charging you, they're also throwing ads in your face.
4190612	4199278	Whether it be in a corner of the screen, and you don't necessarily have to see it, but it's still there, and people are like, what the fuck?
4199778	4204181	Aren't you getting enough money from me already, and now you're making ad dollars on top of that?
4204922	4206463	And so that's kind of where the problem is.
4207123	4211365	Zinacor in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, Beer commercials are awesome marketing.
4211745	4214005	Most interesting man in the world is awesome marketing.
4214306	4220027	You know, that kind of had me thinking is that, well, you know, it is very interesting when we talk about marketing vices, especially things like beer.
4220328	4226990	You know, who has traditionally had, you know, Budweiser has had some of the, like, biggest commercials you can possibly think of out there in history.
4227310	4231791	And then I kind of think of, you know what's really fascinating, and this is kind of an unpopular opinion.
4231811	4232652	I'm not saying it's good.
4232672	4236413	I'm just saying it's fascinating, is that look at the history of cigarette advertising.
4236753	4236973	Blenstones!
4251002	4258665	Not like professionally, but I can think of what I saw when I was a kid back when there were vending machines in restaurants and what I see now, which is hardly anything.
4258685	4261607	Before that, they used to do Marlboro ads featuring the Flintstones.
4261627	4264428	It was like, Marlboro's tastes good, like a cigarette should.
4264948	4269990	And then they would have doctor endorsements in magazines prior to the 60s.
4270811	4275553	They would have actual written doctor endorsements for cigarettes being good for you.
4275813	4276033	Mm-hmm.
4277154	4281280	and of course now truth in advertising is a really, really big thing.
4281881	4287870	So of course we don't have that anymore nor do we have the television ads.
4288351	4291015	Although I have seen those little vending machines repurposed.
4291937	4292617	I have two.
4292978	4296279	Yeah, it's kind of funny how they'll put those old cigarette machines to use.
4296579	4303182	I think at the Crocker Museum, they actually do replicas of some of the art pieces in small scale.
4303282	4307964	Or the flip, because they don't really make cigarette vending machines anymore, at least not in California.
4308024	4316608	If you go to a bar where they do sell cigarettes in the outdoor area, which is the only place you can smoke, it's like the type of vending machine that sells chips and cookies in other places.
4317048	4318549	It's fascinating to me.
4318729	4322370	I miss the old cigarette machine aesthetic, even if I don't agree with the product.
4322510	4323311	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
4323451	4325571	No, the old cigarette machine, I should say that.
4325611	4326172	They were just so neat.
4326192	4327132	They were kind of cool.
4327152	4329873	You pull the knob and out come your smokes.
4329893	4332534	But that's also marketing in a way.
4332554	4332954	It is.
4333514	4336795	And it's cigarettes that you're not supposed to be having.
4336975	4338856	But keep in mind this.
4339496	4340777	Remember what I mentioned about the Crocker?
4341417	4342297	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4358809	4361331	Anyway, anyhow, we're getting a little off track here.
4361391	4361691	A little.
4362071	4369415	But yeah, advertising, who knows what's going to develop in the future as entertainment gets more and more and more interactive.
4370096	4370996	They'll come up with something.
4371597	4373558	Anyhow, DarkSakura, before we get to release dates.
4374258	4376419	Oh man, Reginator, I am not going to quote Dennis Leary.
4376700	4379001	Except for, what is it?
4379661	4380122	You have the...
4380970	4382891	How about life's gonna suck when you grow up?
4383011	4383771	What is it?
4384471	4388192	You have the orgasm, you smoke the butt, you eat a cookie, you go to bed, and that's the end of the story.
4389453	4389773	About what?
4389893	4390613	The meaning of happiness.
4390813	4391033	Anyway.
4393174	4397135	So, um, oh yeah, and the, uh, I only want to eat meat from cows that smoke.
4397936	4398456	Moo!
4398756	4398956	Okay.
4399336	4400277	Video games.
4400517	4401197	Silent Hill.
4401457	4402297	How about Silent Hill?
4402657	4402797	Ah!
4404678	4407519	I'm gonna have to smoke just to get through that game, my god.
4407779	4408159	Just kidding.
4408759	4409800	Don't you know that's what the fog is?
4410820	4428394	So anyway, WayForward did Silent Hill Book of Memories, and it turns out that before they did Contra 4, they had a prototype out for another Silent Hill game for the Nintendo DS.
4429215	4432258	And their little prototype starred the dude from Silent Hill 2.
4433478	4446424	and there was some video out about it about what it was supposed to look like but of course that got cancelled and they also had and this makes me think back to the whole Biohazard 1.5 where
4450186	4458049	They had a completely different version of Silent Hill Book of Memories and ended up, I suppose, scrapping it and doing it what we have now.
4459089	4465252	But the quote on there was saying is that they had two different perspectives for in the game.
4465852	4469213	This one would switch between an isometric and an over the shoulder.
4470514	4473615	And they were looking more at the combat and puzzle side.
4475426	4483174	Elements to zoom out, but they said that the technology just wasn't there to do it, so they switched how they did it.
4484375	4491802	But there is a video out there of what the, I'd say, original concept of Chain of Memories was, for anyone who's interested in it.
4492143	4493624	Which for me, I love...
4495826	4498009	I love looking at prototypes and the differences.
4498249	4504836	I would still love to find a playable Biohazard 1.5 just so that I could see for myself what the differences were.
4505736	4511943	But I love when they come out and say, well, this is what you almost got, unless what we almost got would have been better.
4512363	4512884	You know what I mean?
4513624	4517829	But I wouldn't have minded having a good solid Silent Hill game on my DS.
4520447	4522829	Yeah, Book of Memories got a lot of kind of hate, though.
4522949	4527973	It wasn't... See, the thing with Book of Memories, like, I didn't hate the game, but it wasn't Silent Hill to me.
4528233	4532937	It was very much not Silent Hill to me, which it was definitely, like, more of, like, a spin-off type of game.
4533098	4537181	I haven't wanted to play a Silent Hill game since Homecoming.
4537201	4541885	I honestly think that Homecoming is the last... I'm not even going to say great Silent Hill game.
4541945	4544607	It's one of the last good, faithful Silent Hill games to me.
4545488	4545668	So...
4547415	4552317	All right, well, let's travel around the world and check out release dates of games that will, you know, actually be coming out.
4553197	4559800	You know, it's pretty good that Silent Hill game didn't come out, because if you remember correctly, all the portable Silent Hill games haven't been very good.
4560160	4561820	Like, you remember the PSP ones and stuff?
4562581	4565402	It's just... I never really played the PSP one.
4565422	4565982	I remember it, though.
4566022	4567423	That was Origins, right?
4568803	4570384	I think, yeah.
4570404	4570944	I'm confusing.
4570984	4573545	There's that PSP one and the... They ported it to PS2.
4574688	4575288	Oh, yeah.
4575468	4576429	Okay.
4576729	4579470	Anyways, this week, not a whole ton of stuff coming out.
4579490	4582312	It's more of like a catch-up week, I guess.
4583092	4586794	So, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Wii.
4587474	4593397	I hope you like hunting because Cabela's African Adventures will be coming out this week.
4593977	4597118	Also on... What was it?
4597439	4600500	PlayStation 3 as well.
4600520	4601881	Let's see here.
4601941	4602601	We had...
4605660	4609283	Wipeout, Create, and Crash on Wii U, 3DS, Wii, Xbox 360, and of course the Xbox 360 one is a Kinect game.
4609703	4612125	Also, what else was there this week?
4612145	4613165	Seriously, not a lot of anything.
4613205	4614226	That can't be it.
4635475	4635936	You alright?
4636919	4639024	There's just not a lot of... There's a lot of garbage coming out.
4639064	4639565	Oh, here we go.
4640387	4641570	You're just weeding through the garbage right now?
4641590	4643073	I'm weeding through the garbage, yeah, because...
4645229	4652294	And last two things this week, Cradle of Egypt 2 for 3DS and Girls Fashion Shoot on 3DS.
4653815	4655236	That's literally it.
4656657	4657077	Alrighty.
4658078	4661600	Alright, going to Japan and checking out what is coming out in Japan this week.
4661620	4662581	Can we hang out with Irene?
4662621	4662861	Can we?
4662901	4663101	Can we?
4663141	4663361	Can we?
4663662	4668505	Yeah, I should have called her and been like, hey, I hate to interrupt your honeymoon and God knows what's going on right now.
4668965	4669125	But...
4670266	4671907	Are there lines for another Monster Hunter?
4671927	4673809	I know, I gotta ask you, what's on the shelves over there?
4674550	4676891	We do have to get her and Silent Nathan back on the show though, miss them.
4677452	4682196	Alright, coming out on October 17th on the PlayStation 3 over in Japan.
4682536	4684778	Beyond Two Souls is getting its release in Japan.
4684818	4687360	It's the first print limited edition as well as regular.
4688180	4691423	FIFA 14, World Class Soccer and some various editions.
4692504	4695806	Saint Seiya, Brave Soldiers in regular and limited editions.
4695826	4696226	No way.
4696687	4696967	Way.
4697067	4698108	They're doing a Saint Seiya game?
4698688	4699249	Brave Soldiers.
4699609	4700949	Good lord, that's an old series.
4701890	4704831	So that's coming out on the PlayStation 3.
4706152	4708533	Coming out on the Xbox 360 this week in Japan.
4709914	4711975	FIFA 14, because you know that game is huge.
4712275	4716257	And there's like Xbox Live card kind of pack-ins to go with that.
4717217	4720299	On the Vita this week, FIFA 14 is there as well.
4721059	4723520	I'm thinking the FIFA 14 is kind of a big release this week.
4724080	4729582	But on the Wii U, it's all about Rayman Legends, which sees its release in Japan this week on October the 17th.
4730742	4732382	Lastly, checking the 3DS here.
4733663	4738324	Actually, not a lot of stuff this week, probably just because they're coming off the Pokemon High.
4738364	4740525	There's still a lot of cases and...
4740885	4741825	Accessories and things.
4742146	4746007	But there is one game coming out from Namco Bandai this week.
4746267	4747988	And I'm going to butcher this name.
4748488	4754050	It is Sentotuchu Densetsu no Shinobi 2 Survival Battle.
4755731	4759732	And all I have is a screenshot and the little subtitle on it is Battle for Money.
4760092	4763073	So it looks like kind of like a ninja fighting type of game.
4763373	4764834	It also says Fuji Television.
4764854	4767355	So I wonder if this isn't based on some type of game show in Japan.
4768095	4769316	Or maybe it's like a ninja...
4770990	4771250	DarkSakura
4789892	4790592	Well, let's see.
4790672	4793375	There's not a whole big pile of stuff coming out.
4793895	4797598	We have on the 17th, we have Device 6 for iOS.
4798099	4800181	We have Pocket Titans also for iOS.
4800761	4802923	And on the 18th, we have Alien Rage.
4803563	4809629	We have Skylander Swap Force and Skylander... Actually, two different versions of Skylander Swap Force.
4810149	4811450	Looks like the handheld...
4813312	4831186	the 3DS, Xbox 360 Wii U, Wii, Playstation 3 and then they're separating their release for the Playstation 4 and the Xbox One so that's it like I said it was a little so small you know everybody's just too busy playing Pokemon except for all of us here at OLR
4833431	4834632	I'll get in on that craze soon.
4834692	4842296	I am not going to make poor Isabelle make meth in the basement of my town hall to keep my flowers pretty.
4843357	4846058	I just got Lobo and I just got Peck and I got Margie.
4846638	4847479	I'm playing in my village.
4847619	4850601	Fine, so you refuse to give up one addiction for another.
4851861	4852301	Bitch, please.
4852442	4857024	But as I told you, you can't visit my town this week to get petition signatures because my town went to Japan.
4857804	4860506	My entire town got up and flew to Japan this week.
4860899	4861400	That's okay.
4861580	4863121	Actdeft will help me.
4863221	4868045	Lord knows how Princess Irene is corrupting my villagers at this very moment.
4868125	4868825	It won't be the same town.
4868845	4869746	You want to know what's funny?
4869966	4870166	Huh?
4870427	4872468	Is that remember how Butch moved from my town to yours?
4872628	4872849	Mm-hmm.
4873069	4874690	Butch has been hanging out in my shopping center.
4874990	4875331	Oh, really?
4875351	4876551	So Butch didn't want to go to Japan.
4880015	4880416	Alright.
4881597	4882898	It's like they're real people.
4883399	4886443	Okay, a few more news stories for you guys in the Classic Game of the Week.
4886803	4888745	But first, a very new game, right, Loki?
4888845	4891068	And that's the best part about it, is they're not even people.
4891949	4892730	They're animals.
4894537	4908482	Yes, speaking of addictions, Grand Theft Auto V has officially broken a bunch of records, including the PlayStation Network record for the most downloaded title in history of the PlayStation Network.
4909643	4912284	And there's also some Guinness Book Records, which...
4913784	4914344	I don't know.
4914384	4915245	So anyways, let's see.
4915345	4918286	Best selling action adventure video game in 24 hours.
4918386	4920186	Best selling video game in 24 hours.
4920666	4922007	And they really narrow it down.
4923047	4926448	Fastest entertainment property to gross $1 billion.
4926828	4929289	Fastest video game to gross $1 billion.
4929669	4931670	Highest grossing video game in 24 hours.
4931790	4934851	Highest revenue generated by an entertainment product in 24 hours.
4935291	4937932	And the most viewed trailer for an action adventure video game.
4940162	4942166	I don't know if they really need trailer in there.
4942206	4946915	I mean, that's just like... Great advertisement.
4946935	4948719	Can they go too far with like, you know...
4950339	4953200	Breaking down these records, I mean, I don't know.
4953520	4955180	This is all press release fodder.
4955280	4965803	I mean, it is, although I shouldn't belittle some of these accomplishments, because obviously, Grand Theft Auto, whether you like it or not, or like it too much or not, it is a huge thing in the gaming industry.
4965963	4966303	Huge.
4966523	4968883	And, you know, these records do back that up.
4970444	4970904	Practically...
4971124	4971544	Actdeft.com
4993895	5000824	I actually remember way back the David Chappelle show where he did the Grand Theft Auto parody with the gun switching.
5000884	5002506	Like, if your life was Grand Theft Auto.
5002746	5003467	Yeah, that was funny.
5003587	5004107	That was pretty funny.
5004208	5004708	I remember that.
5005049	5005389	Good stuff.
5006310	5011757	Also, Grand Theft Auto Online, there's been some hiccups, but they almost have it all taken care of.
5012017	5012698	And to kind of...
5013078	5016723	Compensate players and maybe get people more interested in checking out online.
5017183	5026715	If you played any portion of the online in the month of October, you get a half a million dollars in in-game money.
5027056	5030901	That's in-game money, not an actual half a million dollars.
5031241	5031662	I wish.
5031822	5034326	That'd be awesome.
5034606	5043440	Some of the headlines I saw out there was GTA to give their players a half million dollars and then you click on the link and then the sub headline is in-game cash.
5043580	5044041	Of course.
5044101	5045282	You cheap bastard.
5045643	5046584	Click me, click me.
5047845	5050387	Of course, you have to play during the month of October.
5051547	5061511	You will have to also install the upcoming title update 1.04, which is going to fix some other problems and causing vehicle purchase losses and stuff like that.
5062592	5066234	And then there's going to be two deposits of $250,000.
5067334	5071836	I'm not sure when those are going to be coming.
5071856	5074377	I don't know if it's right after each other or if it's just...
5076378	5077958	Don't know how to do it, but that's cool.
5078038	5078378	More money.
5079459	5079899	Money's good.
5082779	5085320	Then, of course, you know, this is interesting.
5086280	5103184	This sort of happened with Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, except it wasn't necessarily that an artist was trying to sue the game because their music was being used without their permission, but it was because they thought the game was based off of their lifestyle, but
5103704	5108706	Anyways, there's an artist saying that he wants his music taken out of the game.
5108746	5111487	And that's Daz Dillinger.
5112067	5120130	And he has a couple tracks in there with, I guess, Corrupt under the group banner, The Dog Pound.
5120911	5122051	And so there's two tracks.
5122091	5125152	And he's saying that he was offered $4,271 for his songs.
5125192	5125773	But then, I guess...
5132936	5137719	And now he's pissed off that he feels because they made a billion dollars that he wants more money or something.
5137739	5137899	Right.
5151849	5153690	Unless there's something specifically in his contract about royalties.
5167096	5168477	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5188650	5190691	Are they necessary to the plot?
5190831	5191052	No.
5191232	5195514	Like the Kanye song in Saints Row 3.
5195955	5197596	You can't do that scene without the song.
5197636	5198956	It's really awesome.
5198997	5199597	Exactly.
5199617	5200337	You have to have certain songs.
5200577	5202479	But are those songs necessary?
5202539	5203599	No, it's just on the radio.
5203639	5207282	The other thing, too, is that he broke with those groups.
5207802	5208022	Yeah.
5208362	5212105	So the guy's actually not... Unless it has to be some sort of bitterness association...
5212965	5214606	Oh, I fell out with them.
5214626	5215207	They owe me money.
5215767	5225274	But I mean, there's probably tons of independent rap artists to get featured in a Grand Theft Auto game that would like, they would pay rock star money to have that opportunity.
5225314	5226475	There's some good artists in there.
5226495	5234400	In fact, I started listening to some of the other stations because I was just listening to the classic rock station and actually I've been listening to the pop station now even though Britney's on there.
5234420	5237302	You have a Britney Spears song in Grand Theft Auto.
5237483	5239284	They have Gimme More.
5239304	5240645	Yeah.
5241025	5242406	That is one of my favorites, not gonna lie.
5242426	5244988	Dan was listening to the 70s station, that was hilarious.
5246069	5250352	I was hoping they'd have Work Bitch, because I just, you know, love that song.
5250392	5253174	Yeah, I saw that advertisement on YouTube the other day.
5253194	5255635	I'm like, what have you become, Brittany?
5255695	5258317	I mean, seriously, this whole reinvention of yourself.
5258357	5260519	Call the governor.
5261600	5269105	There's actually some good songs, like on Radio Mirror Park, they have, it's all these independent guys, I guess, and they have a...
5271922	5274725	A synth-pop track that I put in my car.
5274745	5283012	It was actually the one that was in the last trailer that they did for the game.
5284834	5288517	It was Sleepwalking by the Chain Gang of 1974.
5290198	5293101	Great, great artists that I discovered through the game.
5294042	5294502	And so...
5296758	5298439	See, that's what I like about this game.
5318106	5340167	and well and this show was founded on DDR and I know I found so many artists through DDR especially the the ultimate and if anything if you happen to not be familiar with the slight musical interlude that Eddie Murphy took part in you get the wonderful track of party all the time on there which is it's always fantastic pretty bad it's fantastic so that's worth it right there
5340487	5341928	And some very exciting news.
5341948	5343950	The guy that does the voice of Franklin, Sean Fontenot,
5360983	5384856	Sean Fontino, he is working on a project with the voice actor from San Andreas who did the voice of CJ Young Marley and basically this came up I guess at the New York Comic Con panel and they were asking him questions on it but he dodged the questions and changed the subject so
5385876	5392924	The thoughts may be, you know, the thought, at least I had from that is, ooh, CJ's coming back to San Andreas.
5393145	5398631	That's pretty exciting, even though they said that the whole universe that takes place before 4 doesn't really exist.
5398971	5400193	I just don't think it's really exciting.
5400813	5404758	You know, CJ may make a return, even though he would be like,
5406343	5410527	I hope that's some DLC coming because that would be pretty cool
5423496	5428839	By the way, Dan showed me something in Grand Theft Auto that actually completely had me in stitches.
5429539	5435842	And that's the war vet that hangs out in front of that house by the fence who talks all the conspiracy theory stuff.
5436082	5436582	Oh, yeah, yeah.
5437583	5440084	I sat and listened to that for like 30 minutes.
5440965	5441725	It was freaking funny.
5442685	5443566	And sad, and sad.
5444602	5449925	So going to our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com, there's some other chat about great celebrity crossover songs.
5450305	5453507	Dungeon Buster says Don Johnson's Heartbeat is also in there.
5453647	5460511	They totally ripped from the one-hit wonders countdown that they did on VH1 a while back.
5461551	5465874	And then Bobby Blackwolf brought up this truly, truly classic song.
5470723	5476014	The Ballad of Bilbo Baggins by Leonard Nimoy Did you watch that commercial with him and Zachary Quinto?
5481402	5482183	That sounds familiar.
5482263	5487325	They're each in their own car trying to get to play golf.
5488085	5493388	And while he's driving, he's singing the song in his car.
5493588	5499190	Let's not forget Shatner had at least two albums of him singing all of the hits.
5499931	5501211	Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.
5503192	5505876	Dragon Quest Series Dragon Quest Series
5519913	5525195	All eight games, or the first eight, because technically I think there's ten of them now with the online one.
5525215	5529237	The first eight games are going to be coming out for iOS and Android.
5529637	5532658	Dragon Quest 1 will be out this year, getting it all started.
5532678	5537961	There's a teaser site out there saying that it will be coming out for iOS and Android, in Japan at least, in the winter.
5538281	5542022	We don't know how much that will cost, but if it's Square Enix, you can count on a premium.
5543983	5545826	Don't know which versions of the game either.
5546246	5547468	So yeah, there you go.
5548009	5553015	A new Dragon Quest Monsters game called Super Light is also on the way to iOS and Android.
5553916	5556420	You know, a lot of people remember Dragon Quest here in America.
5556440	5559223	Of course, we got it as Dragon Warrior, but a lot of people remember...
5560284	5568691	Oh, speaking of magazines, which was kind of the theme of the show earlier, I remember the Nintendo Power, you got the Dragon Warrior Guide with it, right?
5568731	5569752	Or was that when you bought the game?
5569932	5572975	You got it with either the game or you got it with a magazine, probably both.
5573055	5573775	I think it's a magazine.
5573936	5582883	Yeah, you got that Dragon Warrior Guide, and so I know a lot of people really knew that game, so I think there'll be some people to kind of jump on it when it's re-released for iOS later this year, we'll see.
5583880	5585581	But, you know, all eight.
5585721	5587182	That's pretty crazy.
5587222	5589363	I mean, Dragon Quest VIII was a PlayStation 2 game.
5589984	5590884	It was really good, too.
5590904	5592585	It was one of my favorites in the whole series.
5593346	5596047	Speaking of big Square Enix properties, going to mobile.
5596067	5597848	I don't know if you guys heard this.
5598148	5600090	Final Fantasy VI, confirmed.
5600250	5602271	It will be coming to iOS and Android this year.
5602291	5602351	Yay!
5602931	5624526	and I seem to remember when Final Fantasy 5 came out earlier this year I remember thinking like well this is this is testing the waters for this Final Fantasy 6 will be the next big one and sure enough here it is so they've said in regards to Final Fantasy 6 the battle systems have been altered for the other mobile remakes and Final Fantasy and Final Fantasy 6 will be the same
5625406	5629329	Uh, so, yeah, I guess on the mobile devices, the battle systems have been adjusted.
5629349	5631750	You won't have to do as much grinding and fighting as much.
5631790	5633611	You can just enjoy the game straight up.
5633831	5637914	You won't be able to, you won't have to do one, two step, oh, random battle, one, two.
5637974	5639795	Some people, that's going to rub some people the wrong way.
5640015	5643837	I'm very curious to see how Sabin's moves transfer over.
5644337	5648160	Like, does that mean you're going to have to just kind of use your finger to draw the different patterns?
5648500	5652902	Because he was the one, like, you actually do quarter circle forward to have him do, like, a big fireball and stuff.
5653143	5653563	Remember that?
5654324	5659608	Yeah, I don't know.
5659849	5661950	I'm very curious to see how some of that translates over.
5663832	5668236	And also, you know, there was a big conversation on this going on on Twitter this week.
5668276	5670878	You know, I talk a lot with like, you know, Spike from Gameboy.org.
5672719	5681942	And he's kind of not happy to hear this news because Final Fantasy V, let's just say, cut a few corners when it came to art assets especially.
5681962	5685864	And in my opinion, the game looks very outsourced in some places.
5686284	5690025	The art assets aren't as good as they could be and so on.
5690105	5696387	So there's a little bit of concern out there that this translation is probably not going to be very good.
5696887	5698648	And it's definitely going to be just kind of a cash-in.
5699568	5702049	I know this is one of my very favorites in the entire series.
5702809	5707291	DarkSakura, what do you think about this Final Fantasy VI coming to iPhone and Android?
5707311	5710472	I know you like this game a lot.
5710732	5717754	Yeah, I love the game, but to be honest, I have the cartridge and I have the PlayStation version.
5718294	5719895	So it's sort of like, I don't need it.
5720255	5721576	Mm-hmm.
5721596	5724538	Sometimes it's still fun to see your old games get remade, though.
5724578	5726479	I mean, when they're good remakes, right?
5726499	5726719	Yeah.
5726759	5731562	Like a lot of people, I haven't played it yet, but I'm hearing Wind Waker, I'm hearing amazing things about that, you know.
5731703	5737646	I'm actually getting more to the point where the only thing that I play on my iPhone is freaking Bejeweled or puzzle games.
5738447	5746272	And if I'm wanting to play a, like, and this is Cody Fingers' legit game, I'm gonna play on my 3DS or I'm gonna play on my PC.
5746492	5746652	So...
5747130	5754956	Well, speaking of 3DS, Alan Alchemy in our chatroom says, I want a proper Final Fantasy 5 and Final Fantasy 6 DS or 3DS remake.
5755056	5755637	God damn it.
5756017	5758119	None of this iOS HD sprite crap.
5758439	5763903	You know, I think that's where a lot of people are at is because, you know, the 3D remake of Final Fantasy 4 and 3 was pretty good.
5764023	5766685	So we were hoping to get the same treatment for Final Fantasy 5.
5766725	5767066	I also...
5767986	5768427	Sorry.
5768447	5768947	Go ahead, Loki.
5770208	5770589	Sorry.
5771149	5772010	Fine, DarkSakura, go.
5772030	5772831	Okay, fine.
5773071	5774552	I use the power of my boobs to go first.
5775893	5782819	I agree with Actdeft, Einhander, but I want a full HD version of Einhander, and I want them to do a freaking sequel.
5783220	5784161	Well, keep on wishing.
5784481	5785782	I know, I know, but I love that game.
5786082	5792188	I would settle for a Final Fantasy IV version where they did the after years or whatever, or Final Fantasy VI.
5793106	5797295	That is also coming as Final Fantasy IV The After Years is also coming to iOS and Android.
5797315	5799139	That was in one of those news stories somewhere.
5799399	5801945	I'd like Final Fantasy VI The After Years or...
5803720	5808523	That would be really cool to see, like, a sequel to one of the older Final Fantasy games in that way.
5808683	5814868	After Years wasn't terrible, but, you know, I think the PSP was probably the best version of that, which so many people never even saw it.
5815328	5816008	Yeah.
5816949	5817229	All right.
5818270	5819010	Let's move on.
5819431	5820712	Are we to the Classic Game of the Week?
5820772	5821372	I think we are.
5821492	5822113	It's that time.
5822293	5823293	Ah, shit.
5824274	5826415	We've just been talking about some classics, like...
5827296	5852730	Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy 6 and so forth so DarkSakura's gonna dive into the gaming vault and I think it's a non-RPG she picked this week this one may as well be for Bobby like you were telling me offline earlier yeah I actually asked DarkSakura I was like were you picking this to troll certain chatters of ours and she's like no and I'm like but you do realize dot dot dot she's like oh yeah it's like oh oh alright well enough teasing what is the classic game of the week this week
5853527	5855849	The classic game of the week is Marathon.
5857250	5862694	Marathon was a first-person shooter done by Bungie, and it came out in 1994 for the Macintosh.
5863254	5866817	People who say that there's not games for the Mac, look, there's a game.
5867478	5867958	One game.
5868278	5869259	Congrats.
5869279	5870600	You've got that and Crystal Quest.
5871000	5871701	I know, I know.
5874445	5880208	Anyway, the game was Bungie's second FPS game.
5880228	5881568	The first was Pathways into Darkness.
5882809	5891133	And the game basically was sort of, I wouldn't say biting on Doom, but it was seen as the Mac counterpart to Doom.
5892868	5898313	So, um, and of course this game didn't get a PC version until 1995.
5898973	5904338	Samarathon was very action-oriented, very similar to Doom in how it played.
5904358	5906079	It had a multiplayer deathmatch mode.
5906519	5911023	You could have up to eight players on separate machines on the same LAN.
5912104	5916427	So it was basically like, we love you Mac players, here you go.
5917669	5918850	And of course it also had sequels.
5918910	5921012	It had Marathon 2 and Marathon Infinity.
5922734	5931023	And then in 1996 Bungie completed Super Marathon which was Marathon and Marathon 2 that was on the Bondi Pippin.
5932404	5939447	So, I'm not going to go into too much about the game itself because the story on it is really freaking in-depth.
5939567	5943669	I mean, we're talking a super, super rich plot.
5944810	5950833	And, you know, story twists and a lot of things that I think that sort of become a future nod to...
5951752	5952092	DarkSakura.com
5968741	5975726	The important thing that I think about this one is the fact that, number one, yeah, it was on the Mac.
5976146	5992277	I mean, you had very few games, I think, because this was right when the transition, it used to be that, you know, a lot of your, you know, you had Lode Runner and all of your old Apple IIe games, and you had, like, the early Mac games, like all your Carmen Sandiego stuff and different ones.
5992737	5997279	You didn't have like dedicated adult, I'd say adult themed games.
5997439	6002421	And this one I thought was supposed to be pretty, it was pretty big news at the time.
6003642	6006603	So it is in a semi-3D rendered world.
6008524	6011806	It's all, you know, texture mapped and dynamic lit and everything.
6012906	6020289	It has an option called a free look where you can actually look around the character and you can use your mouse to switch weapons and
6021890	6025212	It meant you could look down, you could move around, you could look around corners.
6027214	6031337	And the big thing, it was level oriented.
6031677	6035739	It's kill enemies, avoid obstacles, the usual type of FPS stuff.
6036680	6042944	And then to advance to your next level, you had to find a terminal that your AI could teleport you from.
6044205	6050130	So, it had different objectives that you had to participate in in the game, including your puzzles.
6051251	6055375	One level didn't have oxygen in it, so you had to complete it before asphyxiating.
6056776	6059558	And you had motion sensors that you'd have to use.
6059618	6060139	Different weapons.
6060299	6071208	Your weapons were, you had your fists, a pistol, assault rifle, rocket launcher, a flamethrower that wouldn't kill everything, a fusion gun, and then you had this weird alien weapon.
6071787	6076009	So that's another thing that came up in Halo, you know, where you could pick up the aliens' weapons.
6079631	6086054	Like I said, also you have a multiplayer version where it was a deathmatch, where you had up to eight people on a land game.
6087706	6091588	and does basically go around beat each other up until one's left.
6092728	6104073	Macworld gave this game the Game Hall of Fame award for Best Network Game of 1995 and Bungie wanted to add more scenarios to it but did not.
6104273	6108775	It looks like they were trying to incorporate them into Marathon 2.
6110383	6115688	Marathon is basically the big Mac enthusiast game.
6115828	6121132	It started, I think, the realm of serious gaming on Mac.
6121993	6129860	For everyone who says, yeah, Macs don't have games, this was, I think, the first attempt to really reach out to that market.
6132895	6138900	It ended up being so popular that they did end up putting it out on PC later on with a trilogy set.
6140020	6143443	And they even were supporting the Pippin, like I said earlier.
6146185	6151269	That YouTube ran out, so I'm going to switch to this from the Xbox 360 remake music here real quick.
6151289	6152730	This is from Durandal.
6154778	6165962	Well, at any rate, there were concepts of the AI working that were taken from Marathon that were, as I said, later incorporated into the Halo series.
6166702	6174285	And now there's also a version that came out in 2011 that is a port of Marathon for the iPad that was released for free.
6175808	6178730	So if you want this and you have an iPad, you can definitely go play it.
6179451	6183273	There's also, you can get the Aleph One engine.
6184254	6186435	It's at the Marathon Open Source Project.
6187516	6195882	And there is a site called The Trilogy Release that has downloadable copies of Marathon and the M1A1.
6197123	6198324	So you can go play it.
6199765	6200065	All right.
6201246	6201886	That's it then?
6201926	6202947	Your classic game of the week?
6203407	6203667	It is.
6203827	6206889	Or as Bobby keeps yelling in chat, Halo Zero.
6207529	6209210	Which I suppose is one way of looking at it.
6209330	6209930	I mean, in a way.
6210171	6211611	Without this, you wouldn't have Halo.
6212412	6214193	I think a lot of the inspiration for Halo came from this.
6214473	6217074	So, Bobby, it's not necessarily a troll on my part.
6217814	6218235	It's a...
6220939	6221999	Thank you for watching!
6239765	6240486	Dark Castle Dark Castle
6264386	6266707	was a great Macintosh game back in the day.
6266767	6269168	If you've never checked that out, just saying.
6269528	6275190	I know what you're talking about is you're talking about a different era of Macintosh, sort of, but just kind of saying.
6275210	6278912	This was right about when PC really, really was picking up.
6279632	6283734	You know, when the Windows format, because I think this was right around the Windows 95 era.
6284634	6290536	So we're looking at the big jump from Mac to PC as far as...
6293502	6294883	I'd say the everyday user.
6296644	6301407	Alright, Bobby Blackwolf in our chatroom says, I approve of this classic game of the week, Hearts, and he is eating his peas.
6301687	6302527	Good, good boy.
6304208	6305589	You can have a fudge pop when you're done.
6306189	6313894	DungeonBuster in chat says that, reminds us you can play the Marathon Trilogy on PCs for free thanks to Bungie.
6313934	6318037	It's at source.bungie.org So no excuse for you to not check out this game of the week.
6318497	6320338	And I'm going to see if it's actually still free on iPad.
6320871	6321071	Nice.
6321952	6322212	All right.
6322632	6323092	There you go.
6323192	6323432	All right.
6323472	6327274	We are definitely running long for this first half of the show, so let's take a break, guys.
6327554	6337359	When we come back, we will have more Orange Launch Radio, Rapid Fire News, Fugle Question of the Week, your emails, phone calls, and plenty more when we come back with more of Orange Launch Radio right after this.
6344068	6355312	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio episode number 523 already in progress here on October the 13th of 2013.
6355412	6357373	Wow, Halloween is sneaking up on us fast.
6357493	6359173	I don't know if you guys have any plans.
6359914	6364615	Loki, is Josh at about that age where you actually do stuff for Halloween or he's still got another year or two?
6364635	6365375	He goes trick-or-treating.
6365535	6365776	Yeah?
6365996	6367096	Usually just around the block.
6367396	6369657	That's a lot of candy you can get for yourself to eat, huh?
6370457	6371358	New Kirk or Old Kirk?
6371378	6371718	New Kirk.
6371758	6372919	He's going to be a little heartbreaker.
6400208	6401229	That is so funny.
6401329	6402269	That's going to be adorable.
6402330	6403410	Julian's what, six, seven?
6403690	6404811	Yeah, last year he was Iron Man.
6405612	6406292	Yeah, he's six.
6406933	6407433	Oh my gosh.
6407953	6408254	All right.
6409534	6417040	One of my friends is, I don't know how much about this I should say on air, but one of my friends is having a party and the whole theme about it is internet memes.
6417560	6420282	So I have to figure out which one I'm going to do.
6420542	6425705	And I'm pretty sure I know, but I don't want to say on air because I know this person listens to the show and I want them to be surprised.
6425765	6429048	But yeah, I'm so looking forward to seeing the costumes that come out of this.
6429068	6429408	That'd be fun.
6429448	6430489	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6450709	6452190	because I forgot for Mighty No.
6452210	6452190	9.
6452370	6454411	I never ended up contributing to that.
6454852	6458334	And I forgot for something else, too, I was going to contribute to recently.
6458454	6461716	I think it was the – well, I think it's coming up in Rapid Fire News.
6462717	6463617	Let me peek real quick.
6463657	6464318	Oh, yeah, it is coming up.
6464338	6465038	I'll tell you in a minute here.
6465939	6466239	But, yeah.
6466259	6468080	He's raw.
6468200	6469501	Way to tease everybody.
6469541	6472282	I wanted to remember, so I did the donation during the break here.
6473483	6475565	I hope it gets funded so I can get some magazines.
6476745	6480646	I want him to hire me.
6481747	6482427	You should write a letter.
6482647	6483107	You never know.
6485028	6487049	I saw another podcaster on the list.
6487109	6488509	And Actdeft, you know what?
6489049	6491410	I don't think Rob could be Courage Wolf.
6492591	6493831	Rob would make a good Moon Moon.
6494751	6495011	What?
6496292	6497692	I don't know what meme you're referencing there.
6497932	6498993	You haven't seen Moon Moon?
6499693	6501254	It's this derpy wolf picture.
6501934	6502214	No.
6502811	6504192	No, it's pretty funny.
6504492	6504712	Oh, God.
6504732	6505632	Just look up Moon Moon.
6505832	6506652	All right, I will, I will.
6507013	6507313	All right.
6507733	6509133	Dress up like scumbag Steve.
6510434	6515235	Funny you mentioned that, because I told Alan that's what he should be, and he really took offense to that.
6515696	6519757	But I'm like, but, like, you're tall and, like, you have to go T, like, you can do it.
6519777	6530661	See, because I don't know half the names of them out there, but maybe, like, was it that guy that's high or whatever that comes to the, you know, the...
6531301	6532242	and EpiphanyGuy.
6532302	6534024	I forget what the... Keanu Reeves?
6534604	6536146	No, not the Keanu Reeves guy.
6536186	6540049	There's one that's like a guy at a concert or like a rave or something like that.
6540389	6542611	And he's just kind of standing there like high looking.
6543092	6544093	I don't know.
6544193	6547696	You need to go to knowyourmem.com and find it on there.
6547716	6548737	There's a whole website about it.
6548957	6552220	That's the problem though is I don't know what it's called so it'd be kind of hard to look it up.
6553221	6553561	Whatever.
6553861	6554322	It's no big deal.
6554742	6556363	Alright, let's move on.
6556644	6557364	Rapid Fire News.
6557925	6559826	Talk about quickly what's going on in the gaming world.
6559866	6560146	Loki.
6560286	6566371	So the first piece of DLC for Saints Row 4 comes out on October 22nd in North America, October 23rd in the UK.
6570294	6572856	And it's the Enter the Dominatrix DLC.
6572876	6576458	Remember, Enter the Dominatrix was going to be what Saints Row 4 was.
6576858	6581581	Originally, they were planning on doing this standalone expansion for Saints Row 3.
6581861	6586043	It's basically an alternate storyline to what Saints Row 4 is.
6586504	6592067	It includes an alternate Zin invasion storyline with the Saints trapped in a virtual world run by an alien.
6592407	6594369	AI program known as the Dominatrix.
6595170	6600356	And they have to survive, I guess, against a bunch of sex workers and gimps and stuff in the game.
6600897	6605642	So... Only a game like Saints Row can you be describing like this.
6605662	6611128	And I guess it's gonna have new weapons, enemies, allies, and they said missions, and a behind-the-scenes commentary.
6612287	6627581	Taking what I learned from Saints Row III and to all those that have Saints Row IV, I caution you, wait until the reviews come out before you decide to buy this DLC, especially if you decide to buy a season pass because a season pass is for two pieces of DLC.
6628462	6647673	because if it's anything that stays for the third those pieces of DLC were 30 minutes long and they were crap you played them once there's like four missions and you're done with them and you're just like why the fuck did I just spend money on that so take the time to read the reviews on the DLC before you purchase it because that's what I'm gonna do because
6649233	6653656	I've gotten screwed multiple times by Saints Row the Third, so just a fair warning.
6654036	6657178	And yes, it will be, I think, $7 for the DLC.
6657638	6658539	Yeah, $7.
6659539	6662341	So, cool.
6662781	6669585	If you want to get an Xbox 360 and haven't done so yet, there are going to be some holiday bundles, and they are launching, I believe, today.
6670546	6675389	And those holiday bundles are going to net you not only game systems, but two free games with each one.
6676009	6677530	So, for example, they have a...
6679931	6688414	for $299, a 250GB system with Halo 4 and Tomb Raider, a 4GB system with Kinect with Kinect Sports Season 2 and Kinect Adventures.
6688474	6691234	Well, that's technically one free game because Kinect Adventures comes with Kinect.
6691675	6692115	Just saying.
6692795	6705459	And then, of course, also a $399 bundle for a 250GB system with Kinect and Forza Horizon as well as Kinect Sports Season 2 and...
6708052	6718939	I don't even know if that's season 2 looking at the picture now I think that might be the Kinect Sports season I think it's both season 1 and season 2
6722731	6723691	Let me see here real quick.
6723711	6724892	I need to get a better picture of this.
6725292	6726192	That's a season two.
6726813	6728814	At least that's what it says on Major Nelson's site.
6728834	6730934	But it doesn't look like the boxer does not look right.
6731915	6733195	I think he's full of shit.
6734196	6734656	That's just me.
6734776	6736977	Anyways, so yeah, that's going to be coming out.
6737437	6739378	And so look forward to those.
6740458	6743039	Also, I guess that is season two.
6743240	6744220	Now that I look at the picture.
6746156	6746416	Whatever.
6747937	6753420	Also, Ubisoft has revealed the Assassin's Creed 4 Season Pass content.
6754300	6757101	And unlike this time around, we don't get an evil Washington.
6758242	6769987	Instead, we get Freedom Cry, a nine-mission single-player campaign starring a new protagonist, Edward Kenway's first mate, let's say, Aidwhale.
6771028	6774249	And he is an escaped slave.
6775830	6781974	So that's going to be coming, I guess, 1999 for the season pass.
6784636	6784896	Cool.
6786237	6790220	And they have an exclusive Kraken ship pack.
6790600	6791961	Do you get to yell, release the Kraken?
6792001	6792461	Yes, you do.
6792481	6794322	You get to yell that.
6795903	6796804	That's what it's all about.
6797865	6802347	What about the whole fact that the Assassin's Creed DLC is not coming to Wii U?
6803148	6803428	The only thing...
6823047	6828631	The only thing I can think of is that there must be some sort of funky infrastructure that they have to put in there.
6828691	6830312	Maybe they have to tweak some stuff.
6830352	6832994	Yes, this is the tinfoil hat guy in me.
6833234	6846282	And, you know, judge me all you want, but I am convinced that there is something in Nintendo's online infrastructure that is not conducive to the DLC thing like Sony and Microsoft.
6846322	6847063	I don't know what it is.
6847083	6849144	Maybe it's the cut that they take or something.
6849164	6850645	Or maybe it's like, you know...
6852366	6872877	well I would think even if the cut wasn't that good I still think it would want to do that maybe it's some sort of exclusive I don't know I don't know what it is but yeah I know a lot of games come out for the Wii U and they don't have DLC packed in there I don't think it's the cut or anything or it wouldn't be so appealing to indie developers though like I almost wonder if it's something about the process but indie developers don't do DLC for their games usually true true
6873577	6877259	Alright, anyhow, so the tinfoil speculation continues all around the internet.
6877659	6883342	Meanwhile, a game that's coming out for the Xbox One that some people are looking forward to, Killer Instinct.
6883702	6886764	Killer Instinct will be doing their balance updates on the fly.
6887184	6890246	In other words, they're talking about doing the cloud.
6890266	6892487	They're talking about they're updating immediately through the cloud.
6892607	6896689	And all the variables that talk about how a character behaves are going to exist in the cloud.
6896709	6899851	And this is according to producer Torin Rettig, talking to Game Informer.
6900711	6902211	So what I'm hearing is that it is patching.
6926198	6928579	They're just really small files.
6928619	6932139	They're patches, but they're not like PlayStation patches that take an hour.
6933040	6934860	That's fine if they're doing that.
6934920	6938941	They did that even with some Xbox games got around that where they could tweak stuff.
6939161	6947383	I remember one of the games we actually talked to people or talked to a developer at E3 about was that Madballs Babbo Invasion game.
6947403	6949523	Remember that?
6949843	6952164	They were talking about how they could tweak everything via...
6953565	6978965	just basically having the game be online they can tweak all the variables I get the idea about tweaking things like in the cloud so to speak like a lot of MMOs do this all the time we call them hot fixes and World of Warcraft and so forth but when I hear like well it's tweaked in the cloud but then there actually are small patches but it's done in the cloud I'm like you use that word cloud and I don't think it means what you think it means you know what it means I don't think it means what you think it means anyway just
6979005	6979626	Thanks for watching!
6997720	7002623	Alright, here's the other Kickstarter I teased earlier that I forgot to back and the deadline has passed.
7002723	7004684	It's River City Ransom Underground.
7005044	7008525	River City Ransom Underground did make its funding this week.
7009166	7015689	They raised $180,000 Canadian dollars and that will ensure that they will be able to get the game onto the PC.
7016850	7017910	So yeah, there it goes.
7018490	7019851	So congratulations to them.
7019911	7021252	Look forward to being able to play the game.
7022292	7026114	And lastly, here's a game I am very excited about on the 3DS.
7026314	7028355	I am more excited about this game than Pokemon.
7028455	7037618	Sorry about it, but this is far more important than Pokemon X and Y. I don't care if you're going to judge me for that, because this is Zelda A Link Between Worlds.
7037818	7039059	I am very excited about this.
7039379	7051324	There was a new trailer shown this week that actually shows that some of the ways that you have that link between worlds, because obviously in the teaser logo you have the light Triforce and the dark Triforce.
7051624	7054847	Well, in this new teaser, you see Link literally slipping through cracks.
7055107	7059630	Because, you know, it's that whole thing where he can kind of press himself up against a wall like paper.
7059950	7064954	And he goes from Hyrule to Lorule is the name of the other world, it seems like.
7065114	7065515	Get it?
7065775	7066175	High?
7066475	7066796	Low?
7067476	7068257	Ah, her.
7068557	7069458	Anyhow, whatever.
7070079	7072861	As long as the game's good, I don't care what they call the world.
7073782	7074363	So there it is.
7074783	7077125	And I guess there is a new villain in the game, too.
7077225	7079868	But I kind of go, sure, there's a new villain.
7080148	7081169	Sure, it's a new villain.
7081249	7082450	It'll fucking be Ganon.
7084051	7084352	Somehow.
7084392	7086193	Or something controlled by Ganon or whatever.
7086694	7089416	But anyhow, the release date of the game, November 22nd.
7090632	7091152	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7117009	7117850	Stryder, yo
7139271	7148482	and some other indie developers and let them check out some of the Kickstarter games like Broken Age and another untitled game.
7149803	7152826	And so it's basically just hang out with us, play some games.
7153187	7153828	We're cool people.
7154248	7154809	You like us.
7155449	7156510	So hurry for Double Vine.
7157791	7163273	and then Ed Boon who developed Injustice and he was our Mortal Kombat dude.
7164294	7173878	He basically said on Twitter that he wanted to create a Mortal Kombat vs. Street Fighter and that he's reached out to Capcom to see if they would be interested but they have not replied yet.
7174638	7176599	I don't know that that would be something that...
7177739	7204724	Capcom would go for do it because I mean if they do it they're the same route as they did like with Injustice well not Injustice but like Mortal Kombat versus DC where it's kind of pussified where they just you know make it teen rated and not so violent then they could probably get away with it because I think the whole thing was well we don't want to have you know these guys doing fatalities on you know Street Fighter characters or even I think DC does the same thing we don't want we don't want Scorpion ripping the head off of Superman because that's just not realistic
7207282	7211645	I still thought it was funny that they put in the original Joker fatality later on.
7211785	7212325	The full thing.
7212925	7214787	That was pretty cool.
7215247	7224072	And then something that a lot of people are excited for is that the Final Fantasy X and X-2 HD remasters are going to be out in Japan in December.
7224712	7231637	They will be out for Vita and PS3 and the date for release is December 26th.
7232497	7235539	So I'm hoping that we're going to get it soon after over here in the U.S.,
7237236	7238537	Yay!
7238857	7239837	There was much rejoicing.
7239957	7243979	That's the only upcoming game that I had tentative for this year that I still don't know what the date is.
7244799	7245720	I keep asking, too.
7247441	7257625	I would assume it'd have to be... Assuming they're localizing it around the same time as the current development, then I would assume sometime in January, February.
7260530	7262751	Alrighty.
7263151	7267632	I'm really looking forward to those games, but I'm okay if it takes until after the holidays to finish it.
7267752	7269193	I still didn't even play through Kingdom Hearts.
7269553	7272033	Final Fantasy XIV derailed all my gaming stuff.
7272694	7274694	I gotta get back on board with the other stuff.
7274734	7276895	Rob, you still have to play XIV with me.
7277865	7279047	Make me... No, I'm just kidding.
7280008	7284014	Alan can run dungeons now too, so I'm trying to get him up to speed and then maybe we can all do stuff.
7284034	7285256	I'll make you a sandwich if you play.
7285416	7286297	Cool, I love sandwiches.
7286317	7286858	But not right now.
7287278	7290102	Alright, let's get to the Fugle Question of the Week, you guys.
7298436	7301718	Every week we ask a question of our Facebook and our Google Plus communities.
7301758	7304480	You take those words and throw them together and you get Foogle.
7304980	7307502	So it's time for the Foogle question of the week.
7307802	7312485	And that question is, knowing the interview we had earlier tonight, we kind of stuck with the theme here.
7313065	7317888	The question is, do you currently or have you in the past subscribed to any video game magazines?
7318028	7318569	Which ones?
7318909	7320590	Do you have a particularly favorite issue?
7321290	7323871	And, uh, yeah, so we got a lot of responses to this.
7324111	7326492	I don't have time to read all these answers, I'm very sorry.
7326812	7333714	So I'm going to really encourage you to go to our Facebook community at facebook.com slash orange launch radio and our Google Plus community to check out the answers.
7333754	7342237	I'm going to try to read some of these, and I'm going to try to pick names I don't see very often, just to cycle through some different voices I don't always see in chat or other places.
7342977	7345278	So starting with Gaming Nerd on Facebook says...
7345698	7346058	Let's see.
7346078	7346278	Let's see.
7364651	7372937	Unfolded Raptor says, I subscribed to Nintendo Power and Electronic Gaming Monthly and have kept every issue, but the story behind my favorite issue is interesting.
7373617	7382723	In October 2004, issue 183 of EGM, they interviewed a girl by the name of Rachel Moore who was talking about horror games and wearing a Tony Hawk's Underground shirt.
7383143	7387967	About 2006, I discovered Orange Lounge Radio randomly and started listening to you on my PSP.
7388467	7394251	This got my interest started in gaming podcasts and eventually I wound up on AllGames.com, which is where we were previously.
7395051	7397192	and listen to both OLR and All Games Interactive.
7397492	7401153	Then move to Dead Pixel and Spooky Hour Horror Hour where Rachel Moore was a host.
7401533	7412595	I didn't think much of it at the time and I didn't put it all together until I was looking back at my old gaming magazines and had a holy shit moment because this girl I was listening to was way bigger than I thought and I knew her before even if I didn't realize it.
7412915	7414176	Now it's kept in a safe place.
7414616	7417837	Then imagine my shock when I heard OLR was moving to AllGames.com.
7417877	7418457	It was amazing.
7418477	7419177	And now we have VOG.
7419597	7419977	DarkSakura.com
7435804	7451520	Elliot B says I had a subscription to Edge Magazine for over a decade now and it's still very much worth reading always has interesting features and stunning design especially the gorgeous glossy covers though I sometimes miss the days when it was pretentious enough to refer to itself in third person
7452749	7454330	Amanda R replies and says,
7469241	7470641	Game Informer and Nintendo Power
7492526	7498890	My favorite issue would have to be Nintendo Power 172 because they featured some envelope art that I submitted.
7499170	7501251	It was the happiest moment of my young life.
7502652	7511918	And lastly, we'll read an answer here from Veronica S, who says, I used to subscribe to Nintendo Power back in the GameCube days, but I got tired of reading it, so I unsubscribed.
7512418	7518602	Now I subscribe to Nintendo Force, the all-new spiritual successor to Nintendo Power.
7519162	7520204	Thank you guys for the answers.
7535106	7540148	A lot of love for Nintendo Power across the board, I noticed, which doesn't surprise me one bit.
7540448	7542189	That's certainly one that's near and dear to my heart.
7542469	7546471	You know, I got in trouble when I was in fourth grade over an issue of Nintendo Power.
7546751	7547011	Really?
7547151	7548832	Yeah, because I had it out in class and I was showing friends.
7548872	7553014	It was the controversial issue with Simon's Quest on the cover.
7553034	7561698	It was only like issue four or something, but parents were very upset that there was skulls and imagery on the cover of a magazine like this.
7562578	7565741	I had one of the big guides for Mario Paint.
7566421	7567442	Oh yeah, I remember that one.
7567502	7569484	It had the songs in it you could put in the game.
7569504	7575969	The songs, it had a bunch of bitmap stuff for all the different characters.
7576049	7577570	It was pretty cool.
7577891	7587959	For the record, there was a magazine that I was super into that had a short run, but it was gorgeous in its production value and their designers were freaking brilliant.
7588539	7588980	Do you remember Play?
7589000	7589240	Play?
7590605	7593206	I think I still see that magazine in places.
7593246	7594386	Yeah, I know that magazine.
7594426	7595766	I don't know if it's still in print.
7595806	7598226	Well, not like new, but like collectors, things.
7598326	7601807	But they had gorgeous spreads.
7602007	7605188	I mean, the design in that magazine was so top-notch.
7605208	7611769	That's really one of... I've actually used examples from that magazine in some of my own layouts.
7612729	7617590	Borrowed ideas from it because it was such a... And it was very well-written on top of that.
7617950	7618150	Mm-hmm.
7619201	7621441	Alrighty, well let's move on with some more news stories.
7621501	7621762	Loki.
7622622	7622882	Alright.
7624042	7630843	So let's talk a little bit about a follow-up kind of what we talked about last week with the whole Neo Geo X plug-and-play thing.
7631704	7647547	Remember we were talking that they were basically ending their contract with Tomo and Tomo wouldn't be able to create these Neo Geo X portable systems and the dock and stuff that actually looks like the Neo Geo system and the controller and all that.
7648067	7654370	Well, Tomo denies that there was any sort of breach of contract at all, and actually, they're just going to continue selling the Neo Geo X anyways.
7655070	7666675	Apparently, there's been some comments, I guess, from people that had other agreements with SNK previously, saying that they've retracted, I guess...
7668856	7697585	they've tried to pull this kind of thing with other companies with licensing but it says they recently extended their licensing agreement through 2016 and that they're going to basically keep publishing that stuff or making those things until their contract runs up despite what SNK is saying because I guess there would be a breach of contract this is kind of interesting and so they're saying that you know
7699221	7704263	Basically, they're still taking care of, I guess, all the warranties of those systems.
7704283	7711466	It says, we're continuing to sell Neo Geo X products, including Neo Geo X Gold System, Arcade Stick, Mega Pack, Classic Volumes 1 through 5.
7711626	7717188	It says, a license agreement which allows Tomo to sell and market these products remains in effect.
7718588	7720209	So, that's kind of interesting.
7721429	7724370	Yeah, but I like that they're not going out without a fight.
7724590	7725390	This is pretty cool.
7725430	7731452	Well, I mean, if they've got a contract that they signed and then all of a sudden, you know, SNK is saying, well, no, we don't want to do that anymore.
7732132	7740475	Unless they have, like, a legal out in that contract, I don't see how they can just say, no, we're not going to follow through with that contract.
7740495	7741295	Right, right.
7743956	7744516	I mean, come on.
7744576	7746937	I don't know why they would do that in the first place.
7747577	7749658	They don't want the new GOB out there?
7749738	7751118	I don't know what their plan is.
7752999	7753419	All right.
7753719	7754980	I guess we'll see how this plays out.
7755100	7758361	Yeah, and maybe your chance isn't up to get one of these systems after all.
7758481	7758781	All right.
7759161	7763162	Well, anyhow, DarkSakura, I know you like the ColecoVision.
7763582	7764002	Yes.
7764122	7766843	So I'm sure this news has you either very excited or very scared.
7767824	7769004	There's going to be an iOS app.
7769184	7797582	That is going to invoke the ColecoVision through emulation and all that It was on Kickstarter, I guess, at one point Oh no, it is right now, actually Trying to seek... I thought that this was already funded, but I guess not They were doing this whole little countdown thing And I thought, oh, they're going to unveil the app Well, I guess they unveiled the Kickstarter But it's Rant Media Games who did the original Vetrex Regeneration Which is a pretty good little app if you played it
7797822	7798283	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
7815359	7817442	Check out the box art, check out the cartridge.
7817722	7820426	The Vetrex one is pretty cool, if you haven't already played it.
7820726	7823450	They do have the rights to 19 different games.
7823931	7827035	And sorry, Casey Munchkin is not one of them.
7827115	7828897	Well, Casey Munchkin wasn't on the Clicovision.
7829137	7829358	Wasn't?
7829378	7830800	I thought that was the Clicovision.
7830820	7832362	That was the Magnavox Odyssey, too.
7832782	7833202	I don't know, man.
7833222	7835164	Son of a bitch.
7836185	7841049	All the games that they have lists on here, I'm quite excited for, actually, now that I look at the list.
7841069	7841449	Space Fury.
7842169	7845732	I had an Atari 2600, so all those other systems kind of blurred together for me.
7845752	7848194	Space Fury is one of my favorite ClicoVision games.
7848294	7851977	Well, there are some pretty good ones that I even noticed here, like Bump and Jump.
7852037	7852618	I remember that.
7852678	7853939	Jumpman and Jumpman Jr.
7853959	7855240	I certainly remember from the 64.
7855300	7856341	Montezuma's Revenge.
7856381	7856881	Oh, my God.
7857201	7858082	That was a huge game.
7859223	7859803	Zaxxon.
7860104	7861725	What's the one you're looking at, Loki?
7862205	7867709	Well, I used to play a ton of Bump and Jump and actually a ton of Jumpman Jr., Frenzy, Space Fury, and Zaxxon.
7868089	7871271	I think I've played, and Pepper too, I think I've actually played most of these games.
7871512	7874113	Except for Antarctic Adventure, I don't recognize that or Destructor.
7874133	7876095	There are two games that I would want to be on that list.
7876755	7877856	And one of them would be Venture.
7879497	7882079	And the other one would be Gorf.
7883520	7885261	I would put money into it if they had Gorf.
7886027	7888550	And I love the little, like, the boxing.
7888730	7891473	They have a bunch of different animated banners and stuff.
7891573	7896698	And for platforms, they have the Rocky IV game on there, which is awesome.
7897259	7899321	They have the special controller for it and everything.
7900843	7901203	All right.
7901523	7918171	so um they're looking for a quarter million dollars on kickstarter they've got five thousand after the first five days which is supposed to be like kind of like the biggest push i don't know i'm gonna be just completely honest i think a quarter million is too much money for a project like this and i understand they justify it and i
7919412	7948120	you know it's not that I'm thinking like oh you know they're not like they're asking for too much money and we don't really know where it's going I get it they got to get the licensing and all this stuff and that's where a bunch of it is going so that the whole thing is legal and all that but I just think at the end of the day you're going to ask for a quarter million dollars for an iOS app of a system that is so old and I just I don't think there's going to be enough people that are interested I'm sorry like I know that sounds really cruel but especially when we were talking about a lot of retro love earlier but
7948920	7951101	That's, yeah, I don't think they're going to hit it.
7951441	7957564	If they do, great, more power to them, and I would love to check out the game when it comes out, but I don't know.
7957864	7959725	It's a lot of money to try and get off Kickstarter.
7961146	7961826	What do you guys think?
7961846	7962406	Do you think I'm right?
7962426	7963287	Do you think I'm being cruel?
7963807	7966488	I don't think that they're going to hit it, but I wish it was.
7966728	7968189	They'd hit it if they had Gorfin Venture.
7970103	7985611	My thing though is seriously is how these games, I mean because they have a numpad on that thing and then the joystick is really weird so it'd be interesting to see how this is going to translate over to the actual to playing it.
7986011	7993956	Every time I get excited about a retro game collection on iPad I walk away really disappointed because the touch controls just suck.
7994416	7998018	Now ever since I got the iCade that's improved things significantly.
7998038	7998458	Yeah the Vectrex
7998558	7999258	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8029459	8031160	All right, anyhow, sorry to be Debbie Downer.
8031360	8033101	DarkSakura, what do you got?
8033141	8033622	Some stuff.
8035503	8038165	Well, the goddamn stupid iPad.
8040186	8042268	You get frustrated by the touch controls, too.
8043269	8043769	You know what?
8043809	8045250	I think this thing is touched in the head.
8045931	8050394	So, THQ is suing EA and Zufa.
8052269	8057376	And what they are suing about this time is... Everybody's fucking suing everybody.
8058617	8061981	They're suing about the UFC game.
8062822	8067147	Basically, EA was going to be releasing the EA Sports UFC in 2014.
8069029	8086196	and because they gained the license for that in June 2012 which was six months before THQ did and so since basically THQ was bankrupt Zufa paid looks like 10 million for breaking the contract
8089361	8092543	and THQ says that no, we were supposed to receive double that.
8093264	8095245	So yeah, it's money.
8095606	8099408	We're bankrupt, we need the money, we need to pay back our attorney fees, that type of thing.
8099789	8109375	I think for what it was is I think that basically EA had insider information regarding THQ's financial standing and they let the company...
8110776	8118384	They let the other company know about that and were able to negotiate a better deal because of that.
8119305	8127012	And so they're pissed off that insider information was leaked out about THQ.
8128173	8130416	It is kind of funny to see THQ suing
8132140	8152265	I am THQ It's more like their lawyer I am Spartacus Get off my lawn and give me another 10 million dollars Yeah, seriously, it's whatever lawyer now represents him Seriously, so yeah
8153750	8155471	Alright, let's move on, Loki.
8156211	8162553	Alright, so since we've been talking a little bit about crowdfunding, this is kind of interesting.
8163193	8167994	Square Enix has this new partnership with Indiegogo.
8168794	8170255	It's called The Collective.
8170955	8192465	And what it is, is basically this Indiegogo curated page that's going to allow people to vote over the course of 28 days on different project pitches, including rebooting an old franchise from Eidos.
8193466	8193786	So...
8196169	8196489	I don't know.
8196529	8197970	That sounds interesting, I guess.
8198250	8202572	But it's kind of weird, though, that we have to go to crowdfunding to do that sort of thing.
8203252	8203853	But whatever.
8205674	8209435	So basically, you know, you can pitch your ideas to developers.
8210156	8212457	And if people like those ideas, they may run with it.
8213017	8217559	You know, whenever I see something like this, it's kind of like, yeah, we've run out of ideas.
8217579	8221681	Why don't you guys give us ideas and we'll make money off of them.
8222001	8222221	You know.
8223561	8224082	Thanks for watching!
8235379	8239042	I'm assuming since it's partnered with Indiegogo, does that mean we have to fund it too?
8240683	8244306	Are we going to have to fund this game that you're going to make money off of?
8245026	8246027	It's a little weird, isn't it?
8246047	8252112	You're a big company, and you can't... You don't really have a say in it, you just pre-order it.
8252132	8256775	You're at the point where you're like, yeah, it's a big company, we're just not going to take any risks anymore.
8256935	8258857	We're going to let you take the risks for us.
8259177	8261479	That's kind of what it sounds like to me.
8263100	8264102	So many pitches free.
8264482	8270611	If you're actually interested in this whole thing, collective.square-enix.com Check it out.
8270971	8272213	There might be some cool ideas there.
8272233	8277541	As long as they're not asking us to crowdfund all the bravest too, we'll be fine.
8278264	8278905	Thanks for watching!
8299039	8305382	He was talking about, in an interview with, I guess, I'm not sure where it was.
8305642	8307183	Was it a Japanese magazine or what?
8308404	8309844	Sorry, I can't properly credit this here.
8310785	8320989	He was talking about the Kickstarter success and that if Capcom were to make an offer about publishing the game, he would go with Capcom.
8321409	8324411	And saying, quote, there is no reason not to publish with Capcom.
8325431	8346057	he also talked about possibly turning this into a Mega Man title if Capcom possibly wanted to go that way now he is more hesitant about this idea but he didn't come out and exactly say no to it which the gaming media is like kind of leeching onto a bit too much I think but whatever it says he and his crew really want this to be their thing
8348158	8375468	so I kind of think we're grabbing on a little too much about the quote that you know if Capcom want to make it a Mega Man game I just I really think that was a poor decision to even let that thought go out there because like seriously like I crowdfunded all this stuff just for this to come out and be another Mega Man game don't get me wrong I like Mega Man but it's like it's weird I just don't think that they could do this at this point because how would they go about making this be a Mega Man I guess other than calling it Mega Man I mean
8375988	8376588	Thanks for watching!
8394314	8408612	Um, but, I don't know, I mean, maybe the joke is that it's so close to Mega Man, you might as well just call it Mega Man, you know, and if Capcom paid them some money, they'll just call it Mega Man, and it'll be a Mega Man game, because it's essentially Mega Man.
8411144	8412185	I think they're drawing straws.
8413206	8413566	All right.
8414247	8419271	I'm going to pause recording here real quick because unfortunately our stream is down at server room.
8420511	8421592	Oh, thank you, server room.
8421612	8422113	I know, right?
8422173	8428178	So we'll be right back here after a quick... For the podcast listeners, we'll be right back after a quick little music note here.
8428778	8430820	And we'll talk a little more about this and some other news.
8438999	8441400	All right, and we're back here at Orange Lounge Radio.
8441440	8444780	Unfortunately, some technical difficulties that were a little bit out of our control.
8445921	8455283	We'll be following up with our hosting provider this week and figuring out why on two Sundays in a row they have decided to reset the server or whatever they're doing that is causing the show to drop out.
8455583	8461245	And if they can't give us a good answer, we will look into a different provider for a future broadcast.
8461345	8461945	In the meantime...
8462765	8464007	Let's get back where we left off.
8464027	8465589	We've been talking about Mighty No.
8465609	8470554	9 and the whole Mega Man thing and the fact that it was Kickstarted.
8471115	8479765	And the only other thing I wanted to get out with this is that I get why he says if Capcom makes the best publishing deal, then that's the company they're going to go with.
8479805	8481387	That's just business, right?
8481487	8482769	I don't think they're going to be.
8483930	8490414	I think that was kind of like interview bait I think somebody baited him to say that for a headline like oh Mighty No.
8490434	8512147	9 is going to go through Capcom and it's going to be ironic it probably won't it could but I mean the way Capcom's been going lately and the fact that they you know kind of denied this guy the Mega Man game he wants to make do you think they're really going to come back and make the best deal to publish it probably not I think somebody else will and that'll be that so all right
8513887	8516988	Anyhow, let's move on to our mailbag.
8517108	8519149	Every week you guys send us emails.
8519249	8525551	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com And we go through the mailbag and try to read some of our favorite emails here live.
8527571	8529652	DarkSakura, dive into that mailbag.
8529712	8533353	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com And tell us what emails we have tonight.
8533593	8534113	We have a few.
8535714	8538875	I will start with the first one from the Nasty Canasta.
8540600	8541281	Hi, OLR.
8541321	8546205	I'd like to give my impressions on a game that's soon to be re-released, Deus Ex Human Revolution.
8546706	8554312	I was sitting in my big-ass PC backlog for nearly two years when I finally got around to playing it.
8554472	8557295	I sunk a solid hundred hours into it within the span of a month.
8558896	8560057	This is going into the story.
8560218	8564341	I'm going to skip forward because I don't want to spoil for anyone who might play it.
8565342	8570164	So a game with an engaging plot needs some kickass gameplay to back it up, and Deus Ex delivers for the most part.
8570664	8582488	In this first-person RPG, you can be gung-ho by making use of the guns to blast the shit out of people, take a more merciful route by knocking out enemies, sneaking, and hacking your way through areas, or a combination of all three.
8583408	8588810	It is up to you to play however you want, though you'll be making progressively harder choices as you get closer to the end.
8589130	8591951	For the record, I watched Becky's husband play through a little bit of this.
8592111	8592831	It was really good.
8594443	8598665	Now, I say the game delivers for the most part, because there are some significant flaws.
8599225	8603666	First, the games occasionally bug you with handling ragdolls, especially when they clip and get stuck in floors.
8604066	8604347	Icky.
8605187	8610789	Second, while the game rewards XP for various actions you do, you are awarded the most points for playing pacifist with stealth.
8611669	8617871	Although you can play however you want, the XP rewards are pretty much big neon signs saying, "'Want this augmentation?
8617931	8619072	Do melee takedowns, bro!'
8620072	8620633	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
8637708	8643633	Despite these problems, I highly encourage everyone to try it out, especially if you have a PC or got the game through PlayStation Plus.
8644574	8647416	The re-release fixes boss fights for pacifist players.
8653829	8662933	has touchscreen players for all platforms, Wii U, Game Pass, Smart Glass, PS3, Vita, Cross Control, and TBA for PC, and bundles in all the DLC content.
8663393	8666894	And before I forget, the game looks absolutely gorgeous and the soundtrack is fantastic.
8667054	8668455	And that comes from the nasty Canasta.
8670009	8670309	So, next email?
8700186	8700386	Yes.
8701207	8701327	Yes.
8721702	8722563	and my bigger hands.
8722703	8730929	It's minimalist design features and price are all I'm looking for in a system to play on the couch at home or throw my laptop bag on the go.
8731569	8741977	I think anyone wanting to get access to the 3DS library and doesn't care about 3D should at least consider a 2DS as I personally think it is the best feeling portable in some time.
8742637	8747901	Also, the $70 cheaper price more than makes up for the smaller screen than the XL.
8749322	8754566	On a side note, I'm already six hours into Pokemon and I'm not the type of gamer that typically plays that much at a time.
8755006	8759650	I haven't played a Pokemon game since the GBA, so I'm not exactly the typical Pokemon fanatic either.
8760290	8768316	So while lots of people are talking next gen, I'm going to be perfectly happy with my new Wii U and 2DS combo for the foreseeable future.
8768856	8772419	I can't wait for Super Mario 3D World and the new Legend of Zelda for 3DS.
8772659	8773179	Love the show.
8773259	8773679	Take care.
8773800	8774320	Monty Boggs.
8776795	8777855	I'm glad that you're enjoying it.
8778875	8779896	It sounds like he is quite in joy.
8780776	8781336	Quite in joy.
8781496	8781876	Quite in joy.
8781896	8783897	Alright, we have two emails left.
8784217	8784917	One of them is long.
8785257	8785737	Kinda long.
8787437	8788558	Hello, OLR gang.
8788958	8795399	This is my first time giving my voice to the show, being on the East Coast and having to be up Monday at 5.30am.
8795719	8797620	I'm not able to listen to your show live.
8797840	8801001	I do, however, listen to every episode while I'm at work every Monday morning.
8801581	8802421	Well, I'm glad you do.
8802461	8802801	Thank you.
8804389	8808554	I am a 34-year-old gamer who started gaming fairly late compared to you guys.
8808914	8813540	My first console was the original Oness.
8816063	8823332	My parents were not a fan of me spending time on gaming and not interacting with people, so I never got another console until I was older and able to purchase my own.
8823912	8824253	Good choices.
8843368	8843809	Dark Ages of Camelot
8861124	8866506	I've played WoW, Star Wars Galaxy, Star Wars The Old Republic, Champions Online, Guild Wars 2, Neverwinter, just to name a few.
8867066	8868767	I'm sure there are more that I'm forgetting about.
8869287	8875749	Currently I decided to see what all the hype about Mass Effect was all about so I purchased the trilogy during the summer months when it was on sale.
8876289	8879070	I've played through all of Mass Effect 1 and 2 and I'm currently working on 3.
8879830	8885472	I do have to say I've enjoyed the storyline but there are some things that annoy me about the games like in Mass Effect 2 and Mass Effect 3.
8885952	8889893	Not being able to open the journal without hitting escape and then clicking the journal menu item.
8890733	8892495	Why couldn't they make a keybind for stuff like that?
8892916	8896879	By the way, I think some of the menu differences in that were just with the differences of the Unreal Engine.
8897760	8898421	I do believe.
8898941	8901244	Because you'll notice also their texture rendering was different.
8901264	8902505	A lot of the menu systems are different.
8904492	8928589	um also I think if you are playing on PC you can create a bind to load your journal but you have to mod your um uh your coalesced INI to put that in there and if you go to my tumblr massaffecting.tumblr.com I will see if I can find the answer to that and show you how to make the key bind might even share my own coalesced INI with you um
8930014	8933055	Just saying, because I totally end up modding my games.
8935316	8937437	Anyways, enough about me.
8938178	8940039	I thought I was about to say Mass Effect, but it's actually me.
8940579	8951384	My question for you guys to ponder, with Valve's latest announcements about the Steam Machine and SteamOS, do you think this could have game makers start considering PC gaming as a viable competitor in the console war?
8952697	8956684	With a five-year-old daughter, I have had to focus my gaming on PC.
8957085	8963897	With a second child on the way in June, I've had to put my plans to purchase the next gen in the new year on the back burner.
8964438	8965300	By the way, congratulations.
8967744	8990709	I do however have a fairly powerful i5 dual core with 60 gigabytes of RAM PC that I thought could handle most of the games that will be coming out I'm hoping my thoughts on the Steam machines and Steam OS bringing PC gaming into direct competition with consoles is true so more games will come out for PC and the ones that do come out will come out around the same times as console unlike GTA 5 um
8994642	8995122	Don't you think?
9022290	9026236	If you think that the oncoming Steam Box and Steam OS will cause PC gaming to be more of a competitor to the console market
9038453	9039273	I don't think so.
9039893	9045476	It's so early to say because the price is a huge motivator in that regard.
9048137	9049798	I don't know.
9049898	9056482	The Steam Machine is trying to take things closer to a dedicated game processor and device, but it's not really one.
9057202	9063924	It's more dedicated than maybe a Windows machine is, but it's not solely dedicated like a PlayStation or an Xbox is.
9064364	9070386	So I'm not sure that certain things that you do on a gaming console will necessarily be possible on one of these devices.
9070546	9070966	I don't know.
9071146	9074147	I sort of just think there's still room for the consoles.
9074407	9082809	I think there's some potential there, but what my point was is that a lot of times when you're dealing with the consumer market, people are slow to switch up what works.
9084815	9087838	They don't want to make the big risk unless they're completely desperate.
9090200	9091381	Anyway, thanks for the great shows.
9091501	9095264	I love listening to the many shows on VOG including Bobby Show, OLR, and Horde House.
9096165	9101149	The shows help to make my work week a lot more interesting and have a great one, Cyber Judge.
9101429	9102450	Thank you for emailing us.
9102750	9103050	Thank you.
9103390	9108254	I like hearing from the veterans and the people that talk to us frequently but I like hearing from new people too.
9109175	9110736	I really like hearing from new people.
9112118	9113299	Although I love all of you guys.
9114952	9115632	Hey guys!
9116292	9116633	Hey!
9117593	9127356	So I've been trying to get into gaming, but even though I have a dual box MacBook Pro, I still wonder what game I should play since I am broke as a joke.
9127976	9130597	I mean, I know Final Fantasy XIV is out, but I cannot afford it.
9130697	9133518	I enjoyed it during the open beta, but a connection, etc.
9133598	9135578	issue kept me from really enjoying it.
9136119	9140080	I wish I could afford it while I'm looking for a job, but it's going to be a little hard for me too.
9140740	9143061	What do you guys think that it's...
9144582	9148006	Do you guys think that it's one of those games that will last for a while like Eleven did?
9148626	9151470	Is there any Mac or PC games you think I should try in your opinion?
9151530	9151950	That's free.
9152871	9153993	Thank you for answering me.
9154093	9155715	If so, you're a listener of many years.
9155875	9156015	Uni.
9158757	9165043	Well, if your computer is solid enough to run Final Fantasy XIV at all during the beta, then there's a lot of free-to-play stuff out there that you can check out.
9165083	9167905	And some of those are, you know, MMO-type things.
9167965	9169607	I mean, you've got Star Wars, The Old Republic.
9169627	9170828	I don't know how many of these are on Mac.
9170848	9171669	That's the problem.
9171709	9174251	Ragnarok Online, I think, might.
9174671	9175592	Ragnarok 2, anyway.
9176313	9184260	But I used to play the old-school Ragnarok Online through free servers on a Mac using an emulator.
9185578	9186518	Star Wars The Old Republic, Rift
9201983	9229397	more MMOs even things like Star Trek Online Marvel Heroes is a pretty fun to play one if you like Diablo at all and you like your comic book people that's free to play as well even things that are like up a totally different alley like Spiral Knights for Sega is there you know there's there's more and more free to play stuff on Steam that's worth checking out and Steam's gonna make it very clear what's on Mac and what's not and you can also if it's still going on the not on Steam sale because I do believe there were some Mac titles included in that
9230217	9230477	Right.
9230497	9232478	They weren't free, but they were pretty cheap.
9232518	9233139	Low, low cost, yeah.
9233159	9233839	They were pretty cheap.
9234119	9234319	Yeah.
9234720	9244265	Don't be afraid to play stuff that's maybe under the radar, because there's some great indie games and things that, you know, maybe not everybody's necessarily into right at this moment that are still worth you checking out.
9244325	9256492	I also do suggest installing, what is it called, for, not Flash, but it's a game engine that runs through browsers that the Disney games, like the Wreck-It-Ralph games used.
9256512	9256572	Oh.
9257052	9261736	Uni's actually in our chat right now saying that she has dual boxed Windows 7 and Mac Mountain Lion.
9261856	9263758	Oh, well then you're good for a lot of these games we're talking.
9264038	9269923	If you want MMOs, I would say check out The Old Republic if you even remotely like Bioware games or Star Wars.
9270564	9273346	I don't think you necessarily even have to like Star Wars to enjoy The Old Republic.
9273406	9274827	I still think it's a pretty good game on its own.
9275408	9276589	And Rift for sure.
9276829	9279311	If you liked Warcraft, you'd probably like Rift.
9279351	9284135	And someone might gift you Mass Effect when it goes for sale again.
9284275	9285036	Somebody super nice.
9285703	9288964	Yeah, there's a really nice person sitting at this table right now.
9289364	9294945	DungeonBuster in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says Neverwinter is a pretty decent free-to-play Dungeons & Dragons MMO.
9294985	9295885	Yes, I've heard of that one too.
9295905	9296345	It's Unity.
9297065	9300166	That's what I thought it was, but I didn't quite want to call it.
9300566	9301106	Maybe you're wrong.
9302327	9303247	So is that it for emails?
9303787	9304027	Yarp.
9304247	9304627	There you go.
9304687	9308308	Mailbag at orangeloundtrader.com if you have a question for a future week.
9309148	9311188	All right, let's do the FUs of the week, folks.
9312729	9313429	Because we're mad.
9331090	9331930	F you to my stepdad.
9333111	9345037	And to put this in the most general of terms, just because somebody else doesn't believe something that you do or doesn't agree with you does not mean that they're closed-minded.
9345577	9349419	For all you know, they could have done their research and found that it's not for them.
9350639	9362867	Using inflammatory statements to try to guilt trip somebody into changing their opinion or into evoking an emotional response that makes you look like you're staying calm is no way to have a discussion.
9362947	9365328	It's immature and it is beneath you and I am done.
9366369	9367830	What you showed me was pretty tacky.
9368690	9370491	That's really the best word I can think of for it.
9370771	9371132	Tacky.
9372352	9372673	Loki.
9374854	9377375	Uh... I don't know.
9377395	9377916	F you to...
9383639	9384480	It's become your life.
9385421	9387222	F you to the fact that I don't have a voice today.
9388043	9389965	F you to stress making me sick when I eat.
9390645	9394469	And F you to the fact that our show cut out while we're trying to do it.
9395390	9396030	I hate that.
9396150	9397632	Especially when it's out of our control.
9398352	9398793	Rawr.
9400549	9417677	Definitely a suitable FU of the week Alright, a couple more stories for you guys Then we'll open up the skyline for a little bit And try to do some Twitter topics as well too I'm going to warn you guys with this If you want to get in on the skyline tonight You need to call as soon as we open it up Because we're not going to be able to sit around tonight And wait for seven minutes going Is somebody going to call?
9418057	9426601	So either you want to participate or you don't tonight You have a ten second window You better be on it But after two stories So Loki, you first
9426741	9438945	So despite some sort of delay in the whole purchasing process thanks to the Delaware Supreme Court, the ruling has been made in favor of Activision.
9439125	9448308	And yes, they will be allowed to buy the, I guess, $8.2 billion of their own shares from Vivendi in just a few days here on October 15th.
9448368	9448468	So...
9451890	9455692	They will become their own company again, I guess.
9456052	9457794	Or more of their own company.
9457994	9460195	So I remember hearing about this before a little bit.
9460235	9463497	So the news here is that it's been approved, basically.
9463837	9465438	Because there was concern.
9465719	9467160	It was a shareholder.
9467340	9471162	It was one of the shareholders that was saying that they were doing this to somehow...
9473003	9475566	I don't know, somehow screw them out of money or something.
9475586	9476386	I don't know how it was.
9478188	9482672	But yeah, it basically got overturned so they can do it.
9483252	9483573	Alright.
9485172	9497481	Uh, well, you know what, all the changes I've seen in World of Warcraft ever since this split have been for the better, so, and Diablo 3, hello, Auction House going away, that's great news, that's gonna bring a whole group of new people into the game, so, we'll see.
9498041	9512452	Meanwhile, hey, Wii U owners, I know you have been waiting for that killer game that will finally just make this thing fuckin' fly off of shelves, and, uh, you know, it might be, it might be, you know, Mario 3D World 2 or whatever, it could be, it could be, uh, Mario Kart 8,
9513132	9514032	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9537859	9545127	Well, you can totally get a jacked version of Rainbow Road from the Mario Kart games with little Hello Kitty space planets.
9545227	9546609	I don't know what else to call these things.
9546969	9547710	From the back room.
9548130	9549632	I wonder if you can play as little twin stars.
9550256	9550656	Who knows?
9550836	9552337	Anything's possible.
9552957	9557239	So there are some screenshots available and yeah, you can check that out coming later this year.
9557279	9561281	I don't know how much and I don't know exactly what day, but it's Hello Kitty.
9561401	9562141	Oh, it's November 5th?
9562761	9563342	And how much?
9563402	9565482	I think it's $40 if I remember correctly.
9565783	9568524	The countdown is on and it's a slight budget title.
9569164	9569725	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9591846	9592807	I don't know.
9611894	9613015	Yes.
9613095	9621179	Remember when Sony went down for an entire day and everybody said, I'll never buy another Sony product again, and then they unveiled the PlayStation 4, and everybody was like, oh, never mind.
9621199	9622300	I'm just kidding.
9624101	9625342	Yeah, Sony went down for a long time.
9625582	9627703	Remember when they had a problem with their clocks?
9627723	9628044	Yep.
9629745	9631726	All right, anyhow, let's do it.
9631766	9632866	Let's get to some phone calls.
9632886	9638510	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio, but we already have a call coming in, so let's get to it.
9638930	9639950	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
9639971	9640351	Who's this?
9641124	9643025	Yo guys, it's Xenacore from OKC.
9643045	9643525	How you doing?
9643625	9644385	Hey, Xenacore.
9644405	9645505	Good to hear from you as always.
9645545	9645965	How are you?
9646045	9646426	We're good.
9647286	9650947	It's good to know I know about the right time for the delay in the radio to pick up.
9651367	9652607	You've got this down to a science.
9652627	9653728	You beat Ranma tonight.
9653788	9654368	That's something.
9655208	9655528	Oh, cool.
9655548	9656688	I'll put that on my list.
9657389	9658529	All right, give yourself a gold star.
9658909	9661890	All right, what's on your mind, buddy?
9662010	9665391	The web game for the fan-made attack on Titan game.
9665431	9667712	That thing is actually pretty damn polished.
9667772	9668472	I was surprised.
9668752	9668972	Hmm.
9670310	9671854	Have you guys not seen it yet?
9672015	9672516	No, I haven't.
9672536	9673719	Tell us a little more about this.
9673739	9677208	I haven't been into the anime at all, so I've been pretty much ignoring it on Tumblr.
9678974	9688658	Some guy used the Unity engine to make a fan-inspired version of Defending Humanity against the Titans, and it's pretty damn good.
9688758	9689718	It plays really well.
9689778	9693240	It almost feels like Spider-Man as far as the swinging mechanic is down.
9693900	9697621	It's really intuitive after a couple matches, and it's just as deadly as the real game is.
9698642	9701543	Yeah, I highly encourage everybody to play it.
9703143	9703664	How much is that?
9703704	9704324	Is that a free one?
9704975	9705615	Oh yeah, it's free.
9705635	9710737	This guy just made it and threw it up on the interwebs just because he loves the game.
9710777	9713157	I just threw the link up there in chat if anyone wants to check it out.
9713417	9715898	It's fangly.com slash game slash AOG.
9716398	9720099	Well, there's something for the emailer a little bit ago who was looking for some free games to play.
9720199	9720639	There you go.
9720659	9721939	Yeah, there you go.
9722420	9723420	What else have you been playing lately?
9724500	9731242	That and some War Thunder Online just to get my air-to-air combat genes taken care of.
9731262	9731742	Mm-hmm.
9732744	9734086	That's done pretty well.
9734126	9735568	They're getting ready to release the tanks too.
9735608	9743179	Apparently they're trying to do both land, sea, and air battles all in one massive arena game all of World War II.
9743379	9744521	So it's quite extensive.
9744561	9745082	It's really good.
9745795	9748717	Are you a fan pretty regularly of these air fighting games?
9749177	9749837	Like Ace Combat stuff?
9749857	9750418	Every once in a while.
9750598	9752599	I mean, they just now started popping up.
9752639	9758462	I guess since League of Legends took over, everybody's doing their own version of a massive online battle arena.
9759503	9763465	Oh, I didn't even realize they kind of did that in airplane form.
9764525	9771669	Yeah, I mean, you just spawn in everybody, depending on what army you're with, you pick a side, you fight it out, and sooner or later somebody wins the battle, and that's it.
9771949	9772649	That's kind of cool.
9772809	9776851	Gosh, I don't remember the last time I seriously played an airplane combat game like that.
9777111	9783634	It was probably Top Gun on the NES, and you go into that intense rage when you can't refuel your damn plane.
9785335	9786576	Oh yeah, most definitely.
9786817	9792201	And since this one's free on Steam, it's bound to be picking up tons of people, especially with this next expansion when they add tanks.
9792221	9796284	They just teased it over in one of the Russian cons, so it looks quite good.
9797325	9798486	I'm all about free.
9798626	9801488	Steam is really developing a nice little free library on there.
9801528	9802168	It's pretty cool.
9803189	9805830	So that's going to be the neat thing when they get that Steam machine out there.
9805850	9812813	It's going to be a huge marketing thing for them is that, hey, all you have to do is buy the system and you can get all these games for free because they're all free.
9813253	9815154	So it's a great way to market stuff.
9815915	9817976	So that's what I've been up to, man.
9817996	9818736	Y'all take it easy.
9818816	9819336	Excellent show.
9819496	9819776	All right.
9819856	9821237	It's awesome to hear from you as always.
9821277	9821617	Take care.
9821637	9822578	All right.
9822598	9822678	Bye.
9824159	9826161	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9848863	9854745	Nevermind, but I will get to tweets and last minute stories here in a minute First, let me go to the phones Hi, you're on Orange Silence Radio, who's this?
9855426	9867010	Hey, it's Ranma Hey buddy, you got beat tonight Well, that's because I'm still dealing with stuff from New York Comic Con, so... Excuses, excuses Alright, well tell us about the con already, how was it?
9868210	9874733	It was pretty good, I have to admit for a Saturday It wasn't as crowded as I thought it was Really?
9875600	9882866	Yeah Is that because everybody was so pissed off that their Twitters were tweeting things that they weren't intending on saying about the show?
9883566	9900619	I just, I heard about this I want you to know, when you register your badge, you can opt out of that And we all know, not everybody reads the fine print You fill out the form, you spin down to the end that you accept and you acknowledge Add this, add that, done
9901019	9901860	Did you guys hear about this?
9901940	9902561	What happened?
9903001	9909648	The people that were registering for New York Comic Con, I don't know why, but they were tying their Twitter accounts or something to the registration.
9910048	9918136	And when the smartphones picked up that these guys were at the convention, it would automatically tweet, I'm having a great time in New York Comic Con.
9918176	9918777	And people were pissed.
9919998	9940881	that this thing was tweeting for well it's stupid they shut it down in like 12 hours that's that intrusive advertising we were talking about earlier not smart so anyway sorry now that we got the little dark cloud around Comic Con out of the way tell us more about the good stuff not to mention the other dark cloud around Comic Con
9941656	9942036	DarkSakura.com
9971295	9976118	Alright, but for real, tell us some good news out of New York Comic Con, for heaven's sake.
9979300	9981421	The re-release of Ranma 1F on Blu-ray.
9982381	9983122	Oh, that sounds nice.
9983902	9984643	Yes.
9986404	9994648	I was asked to be a part of a retrospective that Viz is putting out, and we got a chance to see some screenshots between a DVD and a Blu-ray.
9995048	9996089	It looks beautiful.
9997050	9999411	And for Ook-chan's sake...
10000421	10002924	They're re-subbing the episodes.
10003305	10005368	Ooh, happy.
10006269	10006489	Yes.
10007410	10007591	Yes.
10007811	10009013	I hope they're more accurate.
10009834	10011496	Yes, you're going to shed a tear when you watch this.
10012077	10013499	Yay, I need this then.
10013539	10014660	This has to be a part of my life.
10014820	10017784	So were they actually showing this at Comic-Con, the new Blu-ray?
10019332	10027118	Yeah, they actually showed it on, I think, Thursday or Friday, because I only had a one-day badge, and everyone was talking about how much they saw it, and I'm like, I hate you guys.
10027758	10034563	Nice, and you know, your name is DJ Ranma S, so you have a slight passing interest in things related to this series, right?
10035023	10035904	Yeah, pretty much.
10038449	10046753	I think one of the reasons why it wasn't as crowded Saturday is because in order for you to get into the con, you had to check in.
10047013	10051856	The check-in areas were outside in the parking lot areas in front of the convention center.
10052016	10060000	Because when I walked in, they finally incorporated the queue room type setup for everybody to go into.
10060720	10063922	And from that, it just kind of flowed like water.
10068550	10072655	What is the secret to not getting a backed up as hell line at your convention?
10072695	10073876	You've been to enough conventions.
10074937	10087831	I think that would be it, the queue line, because when it comes to cons, people will say, they will say on the site, pre-regs at this time, people will show up at one to two hours prior to
10088683	10089623	Just to get their badge.
10090024	10091424	Especially for Otakon.
10092125	10097027	Because during the summer in Baltimore, the temperature tends to hit triple digits.
10097367	10101369	And I have seen people out there for three and four hours at a time.
10102250	10103551	And pretty much in full costume.
10103631	10104891	It's the same way at AX.
10106312	10112135	That's why this sort of thing started for a little bit of your registration line costume.
10114470	10114910	No, for real.
10115170	10124894	It's a variation of a costume or a character that you're doing that is more comfortable to wear in line but still is, you know, acceptable to wear out in the triple digits.
10125902	10126783	Yeah, pretty much.
10127463	10135228	Between you and me, I'd rather get to the hotel, relax for a few hours, then head on over, pick up my badge, and then go meet up with friends to eat.
10135608	10136308	I'd rather do that.
10136448	10140111	I like when AX started doing day before pre-reg.
10140431	10148676	Where you could pick up your badges the day before the convention for everyone who pre-registered so that the lines were left for regular registration.
10150137	10156818	Yeah, well, but what things what's happening now is even if you pre-reg and you pick up the day before, you think that would help?
10157238	10162699	No, you still have people who show up the day of and are usually out there at 5 o'clock in the morning just to get a badge.
10163059	10164459	Meanwhile, doors aren't open until 9.
10165260	10173201	Word of advice, don't wear combat boots that are not adjusted to your feet in line for registration or masquerade.
10174801	10177902	There is a meme I wrote about that I have to post on your wall.
10177962	10178802	You'll appreciate it.
10179463	10184506	Just remind me to tell you sometime about the days of my Jill Valentine costume.
10185646	10186047	Will do.
10186247	10188208	Playing DDR in combat boots is not fun.
10188828	10189108	Sorry.
10189168	10190569	I beat that dress as Ranma.
10190869	10193171	Those sandals, I will never do it again.
10194171	10203756	Sorry I got really quiet there, but I took a moment to go visit the news source that I should have been watching this whole time, Jamie's Tumblr, to read about what happened in New York Comic Con.
10204397	10207278	My eyes just rolled so far in the back of my head I can see my brain.
10207679	10207919	Like...
10210366	10212867	I'm infuriated by it.
10213028	10214188	It's just like, I can't.
10214828	10215269	I can't.
10216249	10217050	That's all I can say.
10217110	10218150	I'm just like, I can't believe.
10218170	10221032	I still see how people can think that doing something like that is okay.
10221132	10229436	Here's the thing is that somebody in a room somewhere said, and just if you guys don't know this cosplayer, again, I'm like totally reeling.
10229696	10231338	We're going to leave the bulk of the story for Ranma.
10231378	10231858	Yes, we will.
10232239	10243090	This cosplayer that was at the convention was basically sexually harassed by this television crew that was trying to film her boobs and things like this.
10243350	10244492	Just really stupid shit.
10244872	10250178	But the thing that gets me is that I'm like, somebody sat in a room and said, this is a good idea.
10251385	10253446	And for the record, this is why we still need feminism.
10253506	10253907	Just saying.
10255127	10257028	This is why we need common sense.
10258309	10262952	And Rob, multiple reports came about that group right after this popped up.
10264753	10267495	And now they're playing chicken saying, well, we're not ever going to go back again.
10267955	10269116	They shouldn't exist.
10270637	10271157	That's a little...
10272630	10278355	Alright, I will keep my mouth shut and let you have the say Tuesdays on Out of My Jam Session.
10278415	10281318	I would love to rant if I didn't have school on Tuesday.
10281778	10283119	I would love to call in and rant.
10283139	10285001	You might need to do a pre-taped segment or something.
10285642	10288724	You are more than welcome to write up an article for my site if you'd like.
10289685	10290105	We'll see.
10290646	10291046	Alright.
10292447	10299514	But let's get back on track here and I'll make this part brief and I'll get out of here because one thing I have noticed on Saturday is
10300549	10301390	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
10331184	10342756	That's, I, again, I'm just, I mean, that doesn't make me sad in the same way the other thing made me sad, but it's just like, I just, I weep that Strider, no one cares.
10343157	10344959	I really hope the sales don't reflect that.
10346375	10346915	I doubt it.
10346975	10353421	But also, everybody was going nuts at the Ubisoft display because they had Just Dance 2014 out.
10353561	10357044	Oh boy.
10357845	10364771	And I just noticed while I was recording footage of people dancing, they had some, I think a pinball, PC pinball gaming contest going on.
10365211	10369035	This girl won and walked away with a high-end NVIDIA PC and I thought that was pretty cool.
10369195	10369515	Nice.
10370516	10387955	I think it's pretty cool, there's an ABBA song in Just Dance 2014, just saying alright, Ranma, we gotta we gotta let you go so we can wrap up the show, but tune in to Anime Jam Session Tuesday at 6.30 Pacific 9.30 Eastern, right after Electric Sisterhood here on VOG alright, take care buddy you too
10389637	10390739	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
10406896	10431921	Alright then, let's get to the Twitters as soon as I can bring it up Alright, so Bobby linked us to this article that says Because we all love lists And it was literally a list of Game of Thrones characters as video game consoles Now, I don't watch Game of Thrones, so I kind of looked at the list going, doesn't make sense to me But it just seems like the type of thing that they're intentionally baiting people to share on Facebook
10433061	10459449	Which is kind of what some of the internet's turned into And some of what Facebook's turned into And I don't know I want to talk about this tweet from Actdeft Because I heard about this too Actdeft tweets us saying I just learned about the existence of a 3DS version of Chocobo Racing And sadly it got canned I did forget they did announce this Like when the 3DS first came out They were like yeah we're going to make a Chocobo Racing game for it Well it came out this week that that game got cancelled
10460626	10479273	and I'm like, aww I really like the PlayStation game I know it kind of got mixed reviews and some people didn't feel so hot on the game, but I thought the game was really cool so I'm sad they didn't do Chocobo Racing on 3DS, I would have enjoyed it but I guess I'll never get to play it sniff sniff
10480831	10494245	Let's see, Tigerclaw sends us a link here and I will read this here Russian government to fund patriotic games Interesting, I'm trying to look at this article because I haven't heard about this
10497584	10510613	He links us to an article at GameSpot.com that says Russia's culture minister says video games have to be conducive to patriotic education and if you distort history you could be banned.
10511534	10514236	It will help fund the production of patriotic games.
10515957	10530591	and it's comments from the aid to Russia's culture minister Vladimir Mandinsky said in an interview with a Russian daily newspaper and there are several developers that they're in talks with for games to be released through 2014 you know
10532953	10536875	This is interesting because you might think, oh, government-funded video games.
10536995	10538216	What a crazy idea.
10538676	10542319	Not really because weren't we just hearing on Bobby Blackwolf's show a couple weeks ago?
10542379	10544640	He was out there at the CDC Game Jam.
10544680	10546161	I mean, CDC is a government arm.
10546681	10549943	So obviously it wasn't necessarily funding patriotic games.
10550003	10561189	It was funding awareness of – but I just thought it was interesting that there's patriotic games of a different sense being made here.
10563331	10564693	Let's see if there's any other tweets here.
10564753	10567956	I'll read this very kind tweet from Sutur who says, Oh, thank you.
10573737	10575699	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10599085	10602510	and I think that'll do it for tweets.
10602590	10603691	We should have something.
10603731	10608137	I'm going to start this on the Orange Lounge Tumblr called Show Us Your Pussy.
10610280	10611241	I want pictures of cats.
10612923	10614665	There's already a shit ton of those on Tumblr.
10615406	10616928	My favorite is Get Out of There Cat.
10618123	10618403	All right.
10619184	10620105	That's it for Twitter topics.
10620385	10622627	So that's going to do it for our show tonight.
10622647	10623988	We're going to wrap on up here.
10624769	10627611	I want to thank you guys for staying up with us late and listening to the show.
10628252	10633116	And remember, if you like what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio, we don't make any money off this show.
10633236	10635938	We don't ask for your money really to do this at all.
10636939	10638761	Maybe once in a while a charity drive or something.
10638781	10640102	We don't pocket any money from the show.
10640342	10640922	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10664102	10667664	If you did make it this far in the show, then hopefully you did really like what you hear.
10668425	10670086	The nominations are about to close.
10670146	10674749	I think we've got like two more days left for the 7th Annual Podcast Awards.
10675049	10684795	So if you're listening live right now and you haven't done it yet, please consider going to PodcastAwards.com and nominating Orange Lens Radio for People's Choice and Best Gaming.
10684855	10687337	And if you don't know what to put for the URL, just put OrangeLensRadio.com.
10688137	10689038	They'll figure it out.
10689058	10689998	We've been nominated before.
10690038	10691559	They know who we are.
10692159	10695221	And yeah, it really helps us spread awareness.
10695261	10697942	That whole thing I just talked about before, you know, getting the word of mouth out there.
10698422	10700063	So yeah, would really appreciate it.
10700263	10702564	But if you decide to nominate somebody else, that's cool too.
10702865	10703705	Just keep it independent.
10703865	10704405	That's all we ask.
10704445	10705106	Keep it independent.
10705366	10706927	Independents are the ones that need the exposure.
10707407	10708968	So good luck to everybody.
10710789	10711129	That's it.
10711270	10715013	I guess we'll go around and get everybody's final thought for the night and then wrap up and get out of here.
10715694	10718116	I will give my final thought first tonight.
10718176	10722781	And my final thought is I'm going to try very hard the rest of this evening to not talk.
10723521	10728466	But doing this show makes me happy and I'm glad I could push through these past few hours to be here with you tonight.
10729587	10730648	Loki, your final thought tonight.
10731254	10733075	I'm going to play lots of Grand Theft Auto 5 this week.
10733336	10741421	And stay tuned to the forums because we'll have an exact time and day for those VOG gaming nights for Grand Theft Auto Online.
10741702	10744023	It might be in the middle of the week now.
10744684	10745184	But we'll see.
10745945	10746245	Alright.
10746825	10747626	You've got to figure that out.
10747886	10750128	And last but not least, DarkSakura, your final thought.
10750948	10751709	I'm very grumpy.
10753246	10753867	Sorry to hear it.
10754587	10756389	Alright, that's it guys.
10756449	10758130	We're done here at Orange Lounge Radio.
10758190	10760612	We will be back next week to do it all again.
10761173	10765456	Have a wonderful week in the meantime and keep on gaming and have fun.
10765817	10765977	Bye.
10767000	10769562	You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio
10796952	10798412	See you next week
