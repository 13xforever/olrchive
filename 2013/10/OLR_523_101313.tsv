0	18360	This week, Microsoft denies that Kinect gathers data for advertising. A classic RPG series
18360	22520	is headed to iOS and Android, and tonight we interview SoCal Mike Kennedy about Retro
22520	29760	Magazine and its Kickstarter campaign. All this and more begins right now.
29760	34840	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show
34840	41960	where every gamer has a voice. This is Orange Lounge Radio here on October the 13th, 2013
41960	48840	with episode number 523 of our program. My name is Rob Roberts joining you over the next
48840	53700	few hours to talk about video games, gaming culture, and so on and so on with my co-host,
53700	57480	say hello first off to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers. I just thought you were channeling
57480	61040	Bea Arthur like you said earlier. I am a little bit. I have the raspy voice
61040	68640	going on today. Those of you that follow VOG Network know that Jessica from Understation
68640	72760	Live and I were both involved with a production here in Sacramento at the Rocky Horror Picture
72760	77960	Show. Well, that occurred last night and I'm proud to say we sold out. It was 500 plus
77960	84280	seats and the cast did an amazing job, but I was the host or MC hosting the whole thing
84280	89880	and that involved a lot of screaming. You know the whole thing at the top of my voice
89880	95720	and trying to be funny, improv and all that, but it was great and I will say by missing
95720	100720	the show you missed this really, I can't even repeat it, but I had to do a Pokemon. That's
100720	107000	all I'm going to say. Let's just say. I probably, keep in mind that the shows that I've had
107000	112240	the most fun at were the ones where I did crew stuff. Oh yeah, yeah. I remember you
112240	117360	used to do tech related things. Do you play Dr. Scott one time? I was Dr. Scott one time
117360	123160	and I was the curtain and the rope and I held the tank up. Last night I played Dr. Scott.
123160	126440	I actually played Eddie. It was the first time I played Eddie for about, oh God, the
126440	130880	past like, it's probably been like 12 years since I played Eddie, but uh, yeah, good old
130880	137080	meatloaf. Yeah. All right. But um, I still think it's ironic that in the original production
137080	142840	that he was Dr. Scott and not, he was both. Well, he was, he was both at one point and
142840	146720	uh, that's why a lot of movie shadow casts will do both, especially if they're stretched
146720	152960	for people like we were. So, but um, but no, I, I have more fun when I'm not looking at
152960	157360	the crowd when they're behind me and I'm not looking at a sea of people. See the crowd
157360	160520	thing doesn't bother me at all. That's just, I guess that's just part of my, like, you
160520	164480	know, how I'm wired. Like, you know, I'm able to do, well this, this is easy. You are an
164480	168560	attention whore. This is easy. Yeah, but you make it sound like I'm like self centered
168560	172080	or something like that too. And I really like to think I'm not. Some people are fine with
172080	176140	the public speaking thing and it's not that I have a problem with public speaking, although
176140	181140	I actually have a pathological fear of microphones and public speaking. Yet here you are. No
181140	184980	microphones and public speaking as in front of a crowd with a microphone. I hate the way
184980	190080	my voice sounds amplified. Oh, here in the echo and all that. Exactly. I don't even like
190080	194960	listening to myself in recordings. Yeah. So I actually have to practice modulating
194960	201180	my voice. Um, well my voice is definitely be modulated tonight. Well I'm running on
201180	206800	four hours of sleep because apparently the insomnia creature decided to bitch slap me
206800	214000	and I woke up at like two in the morning, four in the morning, five in the morning.
214000	218720	Then the cat woke me up. So I was like, I don't play mass effect. I spent more time
218720	223600	doing screen captures. All right. Let's also, let's also introduce, cause we could talk
223600	228400	about coffee and everything else all night long, but we do want to get to video games.
228400	232980	Say hello to tech master Loki. Yeah. Hey, how you doing Loki? I'm doing all right. Yeah.
232980	237560	Did you do any theater productions this weekend? Have you ever been involved with theater?
237560	240440	You don't really strike me as the type, but maybe like in high school from like a drama
240440	245840	class in high school. No, not really. I had to choose in high school. I could take drama
245840	251380	or I could take band and I'm going to be honest, I felt kind of guilted by my parents
251380	256480	into doing band because it was like, Oh Rob, your dead grandpa left you this clarinet.
256480	259680	And you know, he would be really proud of you if you would go into band. Oh, you want
259680	264060	to go into drama, but, but you know, your dead grandpa played the clarinet and you know,
264060	267300	he died before you were born and you know, you're named after him and this is the one
267300	274440	thing he left you and you want to go to drama. Really? So, but, but band nerd represent.
274440	277960	Well I don't, I, and I don't regret my time in band at all. It was a great, like, I'm
277960	285400	not like, I'm not like shady, but I, if I was left to the choice, it's not what I would
285400	289340	have picked, but I don't regret it at all. The only thing that's kind of sad about it
289340	295080	is that since I graduated high school, I have not touched the clarinet at all. I have not
295080	298800	played the clarinet since the day I was 18 and graduated high school. I told you what
298800	302820	happened to my saxophone, didn't I? It was in, I, when I moved out here, I had to leave
302820	306900	it behind. So I loaned it to my friend who is a music major, so she could take the saxophone
306900	311060	class and cause I played saxophone, I played contour alto clarinet, I played alto clarinet,
311060	318140	I played damn near everything that was saxophone or clarinet. And, um, she, uh, left it when
318140	321900	she moved to Germany, she left it in her mother's attic in D'Iberville, Mississippi. And then
321900	327220	this hurricane named Katrina came in and stole her roof and my saxophone. Oh, not good. The
327220	331100	end. Not good. Hey, how about that? Loki was trying to talk about his life when we made
331100	337540	it about us. How representative of Orange Laundry. The only way I'd ever want to learn
337540	342180	or, you know, learn to play the saxophone is just, and really only just a small part
342180	347820	would be just to learn how to play the chord for Epic Sax Man and just do that. Cause that's
347820	354180	all you really need to know anyways. So that's it. I did, by the way, find a video clip on
354180	360860	Tumblr of a guy going in shirtless on a skateboard playing careless whisper on a saxophone.
361100	365540	Nice. All right. Going to our chat room because you know, we do tape live every Sunday night
365540	370740	at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern at the voice of geeks network of vog network.com.
370740	375180	We are live right after the Bobby black Wolf show and we love interacting with our listeners.
375180	380460	We do call it the show where every gamer has a voice and a reginator using his voice to
380460	385200	poke fun a little bit saying, but sky, did you go to band camp and tell stories that
385200	394320	began with this one time at band camp? Okay. So I mean, that movie really just like worked
394320	398800	that line to death, but band camp is a real thing for those of you that didn't do like
398800	404320	we, I don't know if you're not like that, but no. Well, okay. No, no, no, no, no. Okay.
404320	408480	We didn't have a camp. Yeah. We didn't like go off into the woods or anything. It was
408480	413680	go to school for eight hours a day. So you can get a jump on learning your field show
413680	419040	music and, and, and for me in Alabama, it's March in the humid with mosquitoes and lose
419040	422880	your shoes in the swamp that we had to practice in. Okay. But I will say this, we would stay
422880	426080	overnight. One of the nights, like it would usually be like a Friday, Saturday, Sunday,
426080	430080	and we would stay overnight at the school on a Saturday and sleep in the gymnasium because we
430080	434640	were supposed to be learning about what it's like when the band goes out on tour. Mind you,
434640	439920	we did the overnight thing on tour once my junior year and we stayed in a motel six or whatever the
439920	444720	Canadian version of motel six is some, you know, maple room six. No, I'm kidding. I don't know
444720	447520	what it was called up. There was some discount chain in Canada is where we stayed. Right.
448640	454080	Well, okay. But here's the thing, like a band camp, you put a bunch of like horny ass teenagers
454080	459440	in high school together in a group and have them staying overnight. Yes. Some dumb things,
459440	463120	dumb stupid teenager things are going to happen. And yes, there were games for all camp.
463840	470560	Yeah. I mean, exactly. That's not unique to band. It's any mixed gender camp or really same gender
470560	476720	camp too. So I have to tell you now, this is my, my funny band camp story that I told Becky the
476720	482240	other day is that there's this one girl who was a clarinet player. I played saxophone and our
482240	486480	sections would meet up at certain points in the show where I would hear bits and pieces of her
486480	492320	wanting to come up with a chicken restaurant geared toward women called peckers. Okay. So
492320	496080	clearly here we go stealing the show again, dark soccer and I big old band nerds. What kind of kid
496080	501680	were you in high school? Logie in high school. Yeah. I do pretty much the same stuff in high
501680	508000	school. I do now. I seriously like have a wife and kid. Yeah. I mean, let's see in high school.
508000	513440	I, well, I took art all four years in high school and then one year I took drama as well. Um,
514320	519600	but let's see my art class. Like at one point I actually had a free period. So I ended up going
519600	524080	into my art class and landing the PCs together and playing games on that. Of course it was red
524080	532560	alert or Duke Nukem 3D. And then, um, I used to bring my PlayStation one to, uh, that was actually,
532560	540400	I think I got my PlayStation one 97. Oh my God. I feel old. And so, um, yeah, I'd used to bring
540400	547280	that to school and you play during lunch and I still do that now. I bring my systems to work and
547280	551920	I play during the night. I was a big nerd in high school, high school too. Actually, this is junior
551920	557760	high. I distinctly remember going into, I think it was Mr. Abe was his name. He was the science
557760	562960	teacher. I don't know if he's out there in the world still, but he was a, um, a science teacher
562960	568080	at, um, Ike junior high school where I went to junior high and we used to go into the classroom
568080	574400	and play tank wars. V was a tank wars. VGA was the full name of it. I think there was scorched
574400	580720	earth. It was after that, but tank wars, I mean, and it was me and some buddies that I'm still in
580720	584960	touch with his day. We used to play those tank shooting games to death, but you know what's funny?
584960	589280	I don't really care for worms now, which is kind of like, like worms is kind of like taking a bite
589280	594000	out of that same genre, like scorched earth and all that. But like for me, nothing will ever match
594000	598560	like the mega nuke in scorched earth. Like that was always fun to watch when your friends fire
598560	603360	that thing off and swallow up like seven tanks hole. See, you're like, you know, I think you
603360	607840	and I would have been buds. My senior year of high school, we had someone bring one of those,
607840	614800	um, generator powered TVs and a super Nintendo because that's what was new at the time was super
614800	622720	Nintendo. And okay, grandma, tell us more. But it was when I moved into the dorm, cause I was the
622720	628240	only one in our block that had a TV in the, in the dorm room that, uh, uh, my roommate's boyfriend
628240	633600	left his PlayStation over. We played a lot of to Shinden and my room was very popular. Yeah.
633600	638480	And um, we also watched a lot of sailor moon in college. I had a super Nintendo with super Mario
638480	644160	cart and it's the only reason most of those kids wanted to talk to me. So I also had like
644160	650160	VHS copies of like the entire run of Ronan warriors on VHS because I stayed up to tape
650160	656240	them every day. Nice. So my, my room was like anime central and I had all of a, like I had
656240	661120	Ron the project fan subs. That's awesome. And I had an unsubbed copy of the Rotsky doji.
663520	667680	So we would make up our own, um, no, we would make up our own dialogue to it.
667680	671200	I love hearing about what a colossal nerd you were and still are
671200	674880	dark saga, but we have to keep the show moving because we do have an interview coming up in
674880	679040	like 10 minutes. Uh, I do want to teach tonight. We do have an interview live here on orange launch
679040	684640	radio. Uh, the interview is with Mike Kennedy. He is a, he's with the website game gavel.com,
684640	688400	which is kind of like an eBay for video games. Pretty cool little thing. Uh, but what he's
688400	693520	really here to talk about tonight is the Kickstarter for retro, which is a throwback
693520	697840	video game magazine. That's going to be independently published and they're getting a lot of
697840	702480	just names out there in the industry to kind of freelance for this. So, uh, excited to type to
702480	706880	talk to Mike about that project. And that'll be in about 10 minutes here live. If you do want to join
706880	712000	us in our chat room, live at dot vog network.com is the place to be, uh, before I get into gaming
712000	717360	weeks, I had another kickoff topic I wanted to talk about quickly. Um, I wanted to talk about
717360	722480	loaning games out and experiences that you guys have had with loaning out games and loaning out
722480	726960	systems and maybe the good or the bad experience, because I have a really funny story. Uh, the
726960	731440	listeners may not be aware of this, but, uh, somebody from orange launch radios past for the
731440	735760	first few years of the show, you might remember a gal who used to come on the show an awful lot
735760	741280	named rice princess. And I even back when orange laundry was a station way back in the day on life
741280	746640	365, uh, I co-hosted a show with her called outside the box. And, uh, now she just goes by
746640	752320	princess Irene, I believe is like her new preferred handle. Uh, princess Irene got married on Thursday
752320	758480	and her and silent Nathan, another name from the past, they got married. Uh, finally this past,
758480	763200	I say finally, but yeah, uh, this past week. So congratulations and our well wishes to them. And
763200	766480	I'm sure many of the listeners, uh, especially the old school ones. And they hear those names
766480	770800	will be excited to hear that the guy hitched. Well, guess what? Princess Irene went on a
770800	776080	honeymoon to Japan. Perfect nerd honeymoon with her new husband, right? Man. I'm jealous. I know,
776080	780800	right. I'm kind of jealous too. So they went to Japan and, uh, she actually asked me, she said,
780800	785600	Hey Rob, remember a long time ago, you said I could borrow your 3DS to play animal crossing
785600	789680	at some point. She's like, would it be possible to do that now? Because I got a 12 hour flight
789680	794640	to Japan and that would be a great way to pass the time. And I said, Oh, sure. So, uh, she came
794640	798800	over Wednesday night. We caught up a little bit. I gave her my 3DS and on she went well,
798800	805200	by the time she got married and was on her way out the door, I realized, Oh crap, Pokemon X and Y is
805200	811520	on Saturday. And I just loaned my 3DS to my friend. Is this your excuse to get an XL? Well,
812400	815200	if your name was Shane and I don't know if he's out there listening,
815200	819520	Shane, the salesman is currently trying to convince me that the best life choice for me
819520	826800	would be to buy a Pokemon branded 3DS XL or 2DS. He actually said, yeah, 2DS would be a good idea
826800	832880	too. And I'm like, Shane, that's money. That's like 180 bucks. If we were talking like 20 bucks,
832880	838160	maybe, but that's like a whole nother system. So I'm currently having to sit and wait and I'm
838160	843600	missing the Pokemon boat because I loaned out my 3DS. Now, look, I don't regret it because Irene,
843600	847680	obviously love her to bits. And I, if I can bring a little more entertainment,
847680	851200	tame it to her honeymoon, then, then so be it. But it's just kind of one of those things where
851200	857280	I was like, don't that's too bad, but you know what? You can turn this upside or turn this back
857280	864800	around because the grand theft auto five ship has made port and guess what? It's available right now
864800	871440	for you to go get and play. So, so salesman Loki is going to counter salesman Shane by saying, Hey,
871440	876800	do you know for a third of the price of the 3DS, you could be playing grand theft auto five in the
876800	883120	vog club right now, right? What you could go the free route and play borderlands two with me play
883120	889840	the games I already have, right? Yeah. How about being frugal? Let's hear it for fiscal responsibility.
891360	895440	All right. Go into our chat room for some comments at live.vognetwork.com.
895440	901040	Bobby Black Wolf says Irene deserves your 3DS more than you deserve Pokemon. Hey, shut up.
901680	906080	Alpha Kinanagram says sky. Maybe she'll get you some Japanese street passes.
906080	909840	I actually told her because if there weren't chargers on the plane, I told her to turn the
909840	915440	wifi off. So that way, uh, she would save battery power would probably be the smart thing to do.
915440	920320	Do they even have the same plugs in Japan that we have here? So she's going to be in for a rude
920320	926640	awakening when she gets off the plane. Um, two prong. Yes. Oh really? Okay. Yeah. Two prongs
926640	932320	will work. They just don't have the grounded. Oh yeah. Well, okay. We have Japanese PlayStation
932880	936240	twos, Rob. Oh, that's true. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I don't have a Japanese dreamcast.
938400	942240	If you haven't learned in the past 11 and a half years, sometimes things come out of my mouth
942240	947760	before I really think them through dark soccer. The one who had to have the, uh, the, uh, mod,
947760	954400	the little, uh, um, plug mod was Jessica because of her APS too.
954400	958720	Oh, okay. I had the different plug on it. Gotcha. Bobby, I would totally have played
958800	963760	Borderlands two with you. I have had my character ready to go for the longest time and no one's been
963760	967920	playing. Well, I was going to say, uh, in the chat room at live.vog network.com, there's several
967920	971760	people. Black Wolf is saying, play Borderlands two with me, play Borderlands two with me,
971760	977680	dark soccer and Loki. Uh, game grew says, meanwhile, Irene is playing Pokemon in Japan.
977680	981440	Uh, no, she's playing animal crossing. I know that, uh, dungeon buster says I'll play Borderlands
981440	986640	two with you. So, uh, it looks like you might've started, uh, a Borderlands two game night in our
986640	991600	chat room, dark soccer, a way to go. So I'm curious, do you guys have any nightmare stories
991600	996000	or maybe good stories about loaning things out? Uh, dark soccer, you guys have the game vault.
996000	999920	Surely you guys loan stuff out all the time. Well, I, for some reason I can't find my first
999920	1003360	bus to move soundtrack and I hope I didn't lend that out. Cause I don't think I would have loaned
1003360	1008160	that out. Um, I don't know. Usually it works the other way around. People loan me stuff and then
1008160	1013680	they move or I move. Or you keep their stuff forever. Like my dance pad that you had for
1013760	1018240	like a year. It's fine. If I really missed it, I would ask for it back. Well, it's like,
1018240	1023920	it's how I got my copy of Corona trigger. My friend loaned it to me. He moved to a Spanish
1023920	1029040	Fort and then I moved to California. Oops. He hasn't asked for it back. So it's fine.
1029040	1033840	Didn't you save file is still on there. Didn't you get your Saturn copy of symphony of the night
1033840	1038240	through some type of game trade? No, I thought that we bought that shit. I thought it was
1038240	1041280	something with like a friend of yours owed you money. And that was what she gave you.
1041280	1048160	That was Dracula X. Oh, that was close. Close. My friend Krista who lives in Nagoya.
1049360	1053280	She loves her now, but she used to live in Berkeley. We went to anime expo. She
1053280	1057280	owed us a hundred bucks for her part of the room in the trip. Oh, okay. It was an exchange. She
1057280	1063440	went to Japan to go visit her family. Came back with Dracula X for us. She already had two copies.
1063440	1067920	Got it. Okay. I thought that was like a loaning story. Okay. But that was the exchange for
1067920	1072480	convention space. I gotcha. Trade for goods. Oh, I loan out my games all the time and I forget
1072480	1077040	people forget. I loan people stuff. So right now I don't think I have anything loaned out, but
1078320	1082000	I could very well. Oh, what? Okay. Oh, I have another hilarious loaning, somebody,
1082000	1086640	a game story. Okay. So, uh, Flaco Jones, I think it was, and I'm sorry if I'm calling you out and
1086640	1091680	it wasn't really you. I loaned him a copy of silent Hill for the room on X-Box. At least I
1091680	1097680	think it was him. And it got passed back to what I knew you had it for forever. I had it for a while.
1097760	1101680	And then I loaned it to, I think it was flog. It might've been extra for though. It was one
1101680	1106880	of them. And they gave it back to Irene because they were like, well, Irene's going to see you
1106880	1112560	next before I do. And so funny enough, when's the next time I see Irene when we're all at a party
1113280	1117840	and then. They give me the game back and I'm like, yay, here's my game back. I can go take
1117840	1122160	this home and not play it. Cause like my original X-Box is like in storage at this point. I don't
1122160	1126160	even, I mean, I guess it's backwards compatible on three 60, but let's be real. I don't have
1126160	1130480	like an anchoring to play silent Hill for the room anytime soon. So what did I do guys?
1131360	1140160	I left the game at the party. I didn't even bring it home. I'm pretty sure that game has been sold
1140160	1144320	by this point. So it's just funny. You can borrow mine. If everyone play it
1144960	1148960	now that I actually have it. I don't really like, like if I was going to go back and play
1148960	1154240	a silent Hill game, I think I'd go play two or three. I loaned actually my three to my friend
1154240	1160480	Carly. You remember you met Carly, haven't you? The one who says the best rendition of the sea
1160480	1167760	bomb ever. Oh my, she makes it sound like it's poetry, but, um, at any rate, she had my silent
1167760	1174000	Hill three for a long time. And I think I have it back. I don't know. Yeah. Usually it's people
1174000	1179520	that I will, Julie has borrowed stuff of mine and never given it back. And then she'll say,
1179520	1182720	Oh, that was mine. I bought that. No, that was not yours. Here's the receipt.
1182720	1186400	I like that. You're calling people out here on the show. She's not listening though. Right?
1186400	1190560	No, she's not listening. She's too busy playing fantasy star universe,
1190560	1194240	which I think she's like the one person who's probably playing PSO too now. Oh yeah. Oh,
1194240	1200240	everybody's moved on. That's right. I need to start playing again. Sounds good. All right.
1200800	1204240	Let's go ahead and move into our gaming weeks, at least here for just a little bit. We'll talk
1204240	1207920	about our gaming weeks. So we are going to get interrupted though, by the live interview here
1207920	1212400	with Mike from the retro magazine Kickstarter here in just a minute, but we'll start with our
1212400	1216640	gaming week. So at least get dark soccer. Okay. Well, um, I played mass effect three
1216640	1221360	because Tara started playing mass effect and I was like, Oh, mass effect. So I started playing
1221360	1227920	and spent more time screen capping than playing the game. And then, um, I, uh, I played animal
1227920	1232240	crossing. I played a lot of animal crossing cause I'm trying to get my tan back and, um,
1233680	1237520	I played fractal and I played final fantasy 14, which I want us to play at the same time.
1237680	1245520	Second run dungeons. And then, um, uh, a lot, a lot of, um, be jeweled on my phone,
1246160	1251600	on your phone, the blitz version where you try to do it. I play the stupid butterfly mode and
1251600	1256320	diamond mine mode because I don't, I'm so out of the loop. It's actually really cool. Cause it
1256320	1261120	requires a real strategy. When you play, it's basically your, your butterflies have different
1261120	1265280	colors and you have to line them up. But every time you line up something else, the butterflies
1265280	1269200	move up a level and there's a spider at the top waiting to pick them up. So you have to keep all
1269200	1273280	these butterflies from reaching the top and at the same time making your lines and doing them.
1273280	1278720	So you have no time limit, but you have to think carefully. Okay. All right. Uh, is that it for
1278720	1283120	your gaming week? Yes. All right. Well, before we get to Loki's gaming week, we're going to cut in
1283120	1288960	here cause it's about that time. Uh, we are going to go to the phones right now and talk to Mike
1288960	1296720	Kennedy. He is with retro, which is a Kickstarter that's going on right now for a throwback video
1296720	1302160	game magazine as in like a print magazine. And uh, let's see if we get him on the line. Hi Mike,
1302160	1306480	you there? I'm here. How's it going? Good. Welcome to orange launch radio. How are you?
1306480	1311120	I'm doing great. Thanks for having me on. No problem whatsoever. So tell us a little bit
1311120	1314880	about your Kickstarter. You're behind this Kickstarter for a new magazine retro, right?
1315440	1319520	Yeah. Yeah. This is something that, uh, has come about pretty quick. Um, I've actually had
1319520	1324640	the idea of adding content to a gaming auction site that I've run called game gavel for about,
1324640	1329600	I don't know, maybe two years now. And, uh, we originally, uh, we're bringing on some writers
1329600	1334400	and we were doing, you know, just online content, uh, kind of, uh, kind of an editorial side of the
1334400	1338000	website. And then one of my writers said, Mike, have you ever thought about doing a,
1338000	1341520	a digital magazine? And I thought, well, hell no, I've never really thought about doing a
1341520	1346960	digital magazine. Um, only because I'm, I've never, I mean, personally, I don't have digital
1346960	1352080	magazines on my iPad. Um, and I don't know how many people really do. Um, but we're hoping
1352080	1356080	obviously that, that, you know, it's something that people are doing more and more of. Um,
1356080	1360160	but then I got the idea after hooking up with another guy, uh, Mark Kaminsky,
1360160	1364160	who's our layout and design guy. Uh, he said, let's go for it. Let's just, you know, let's just,
1364160	1369760	let's do a boat. Let's do a print and digital. And, uh, this was maybe two and a half weeks ago,
1369760	1375920	maybe three, three weeks ago, tops. And since he's come on board, um, you know, he works for
1375920	1379840	just this really large media company and, and, uh, he does, uh, you know, magazine layout and
1379840	1385440	design for tons of other magazines. And he basically, uh, wanted to, um, contribute to
1385440	1391360	the project and, uh, you know, just basically came on board and has just really, um, uh, I just have
1391360	1395200	to say kicked ass because I mean, he does, he designed that video for us that we're using on
1395200	1400880	the Kickstarter page. Uh, you know, he designed a kind of a preview layout of the magazine and
1400880	1406000	he's just kind of done this all really, really fast. So he was sort of the missing link in,
1406000	1410800	in the idea of doing, uh, whether it was a digital or print magazine. So, um, so sorry,
1410800	1415600	this whole idea is only about three weeks old with the magazine only about three weeks. Yeah.
1415600	1420080	So in a really short amount of time, uh, I guess I can tell everybody a little bit about, uh,
1420080	1426080	the magazine first is, is, um, I've always had this idea of kind of going out and recruiting
1426080	1432640	some of the best writers in the industry and, you know, not only, uh, writers from, you know,
1432640	1437840	maybe the past maybe five to 10 years, but going back and really digging deep into the history of
1437840	1442000	video game journalism and going out and just kind of recruiting, uh, right now we've got over three
1442000	1447600	decades of video game journalists. So no matter, you know, when anybody kind of grew up gaming or
1447600	1451920	what your decade of gaming was, whether it was the late seventies, early to mid eighties,
1451920	1456240	the nineties, or today, you're probably going to recognize some of the contributors that we're
1456240	1460720	going to have on the magazine. So I had to assemble this team really in about a week's time.
1460720	1465200	You know, um, I called Jeremy parish and I get Jeremy, you know, gave me tons and tons of great
1465200	1470160	information about, uh, you know, uh, compensation, you know, in this day and age and, and what you
1470160	1475360	kind of need to pay. Right. And, um, you know, kind of, uh, and I've got quite a few connections
1476160	1480960	in the industry already, uh, just running game gavel for the last six years and kind of living
1480960	1485200	in Southern California, kind of the hotbed of, of developer and publisher activity. I got a lot
1485200	1489520	of friends in the develop, you know, that are developers and, and, uh, publishing executives
1489520	1495200	and stuff like that. So, um, it just sort of, the, the plans just sort of aligned very quickly
1495200	1499680	on this thing. And I wasn't able to assemble, uh, pretty much kind of a who's who of gaming
1499680	1503920	journalists to bring them in on this and, and lo and behold, everybody thought it was a great idea.
1503920	1508560	Um, in fact, a lot of them said that they've all had ideas for doing something like this,
1509200	1512720	um, but just never, but never done it yet. So it's kind of one of those, like, it almost
1512720	1517520	sounds like it's like a, um, I don't know, like, uh, uh, uh, they bring in everything together,
1517520	1523840	like the Voltron or something of, of this, this, uh, people, uh, these writers. And, um, I, I,
1523840	1527040	that's why I expressed surprise a minute ago is that, wow, this thing's only three weeks old
1527040	1530960	because, you know, you go over to the Kickstarter page and I'm scrolling and scrolling and scrolling
1531760	1535280	and it's, you know, this big list of people. And I'm like, wow, you got, you got your little team
1535280	1539840	America together at well team worldwide really together in like three weeks. That's, that's
1539840	1543520	pretty, I didn't really make it through the bottom of the page because I stopped to look at Sean
1543520	1548640	baby's hair. I was just like, what is going on there? I don't understand this. I don't either.
1548640	1552320	You know, I met him for the first time. We were at the Portland retro gaming expo last weekend
1552320	1557760	and, um, he was up there and we've been talking on the phone a lot and, uh, but yeah, he's basically,
1557920	1561760	that's pretty much it, you know, and I think he'll, uh, sometimes it's that little Mohawk's
1561760	1566560	green and fluorescent green. Sometimes it's orange, pink or red. I'm very jealous of him
1566560	1569840	that it's not falling out because when you dye your hair that much, that's what's supposed to
1569840	1573200	be happening. But anyway, if you guys have a question for Mike, uh, with retro magazine,
1573200	1578880	Kickstarter, you can ask that live here in our chat room, live.vog network.com dark soccer.
1578880	1582480	I know you're dying to say something here because you've been studying print for awhile. This has to
1582480	1587360	be tickling you this whole idea, right? Well, you had me at print. I love the smell of CMYK fumes in
1587360	1594320	the morning. That's right. Um, I actually am a print designer and I, and I actually have just
1594320	1602400	recently gone into contract writing as in writing by contract. Yes I have. So, um, I, I find the
1602400	1608320	whole thing just very fascinating. I was wondering though, um, where you happen to get other, uh,
1608320	1612720	bits of inspiration from, cause I know that in the UK there's retro gamer right now and
1613120	1618160	yep. Yeah, no, that's a great magazine. I mean if, if, you know, if we can put together,
1618160	1622320	you know, something half as good as that, I'd be, you know, I love it. I mean that,
1622960	1628480	the thing that's so great about their magazine is they pack so much into it and they, they throw it
1628480	1633680	all together. Um, and like every spread, every like, you know, two page spread will have like
1633680	1638000	10 different stories going on, but yet they make it work. You know what I mean? And every time you
1638000	1641680	read that magazine, you see something new. It doesn't matter how many times you pick it up
1641680	1644400	or you know how old the magazine is. I mean you're reading through it and you're like,
1644400	1648640	God, I don't remember reading this, you know, the other 20 times I've flipped through the pages,
1648640	1652960	you know, their design is so clever. So I've, I was thinking, you know, I've thought for a
1652960	1657440	while that we could use something like that, you know, geared toward a North American audience
1657440	1661680	because some of the machines they cover over there, we never got out over here, but are you
1661680	1666400	also planning on including like some of the old import market, you know? Yeah, I tell you what,
1666400	1672560	it's since we've launched the Kickstarter campaign, we have had, uh, some great writers
1672560	1677840	from around the world contact us and want to be a part of this. Um, also in the U S I mean,
1677840	1683200	that's why this list keeps growing. I mean, when I first started out with this, I had,
1683200	1690320	uh, like Jeremy, uh, Sean, uh, cat. Um, you know, we went after Bob Mackie. Uh, of course he, he,
1690320	1693920	uh, the doors open to him, but he had some other things that, that, that might get in the way you
1693920	1698400	thought. Um, and a few others. So I had like maybe, maybe 10 to 12 people. And I think now
1698400	1703600	we've grown to like over 20 because people just want to be a part of this. And it's almost like,
1703600	1708000	you know, uh, they're not doing it for the money of course, because right now it's so segment,
1708000	1711840	we have so many people, it's not like in each, any one of them is going to be, you know, submitting
1711840	1715840	so many things. A lot of these people are going to be submitting, you know, maybe one or two columns,
1715840	1720480	um, that are recurring. Um, while we have others that might do, you know, a feature article,
1720480	1724160	an interview if we want them to do that, you know, or some assignment type, some assignment
1724160	1728960	type work. But, but yeah, the, to, to answer the question, we've had, uh, a couple of folks in
1728960	1734240	Japan, uh, send me some of their work and their journalists and podcasters over there. Uh, we've
1734240	1740000	had, uh, someone in the UK, we had somebody in Germany and, um, the deal is, I mean, I'm,
1740000	1745200	I'm basically, um, we'd love to have import information in here, whether it's current gen or,
1745200	1749120	you know, retro and classic information, because I mean, those areas had huge, you know, huge
1749120	1754320	influences, uh, even on the gaming here in the United States. Um, and it's sort of like,
1754320	1757920	you know, I mean, uh, I don't know what your first introduction was kind of to Japanese gaming,
1757920	1762480	but like the turbo graphics for me when I was little was sort of that strange, you know,
1762480	1768240	kind of mystical game, you know, console that, you know, played Japanese games. And, um, you know,
1768240	1772640	and then I guess the Neo Geo kind of came in and, you know, uh, I guess maybe right after that,
1772640	1776160	or pretty cool, pretty damn near about the same time, I guess. But, you know, it was always just
1776160	1780560	weird and seeing these games, um, you know, it was, it was just totally, you know, mind blowing
1780560	1783680	to see what they were doing over there. So there's some great history there and we really want to
1783680	1787600	cover all of the bases in retro. I mean, uh, you know, all the bases. So that personally makes me
1787600	1791600	happy. I guess you could, uh, could, uh, imagine my, uh, delight when I married someone who had
1791600	1798000	a turbo duo and a Neo Geo. Oh yeah. Um, I always like to ask this question of, uh, Kickstarter folks
1798000	1802800	when they come on the show, uh, you have this Kickstarter behind the campaign. I think it's
1802800	1806080	kind of obvious that, you know, the money is probably being raised because you actually have
1806080	1810400	to print the magazine that doesn't come for free, but what is it you're specifically raising the
1810400	1814960	money to do in this process? Well, mainly actually paying the writers, you know, these guys don't
1814960	1822160	come cheap and, uh, you know, my original budget was, uh, about six grand per issue, you know,
1822160	1827040	and if we got six issues, there's 36 grand right there. Right. Right. Um, and then of course we do
1827040	1831120	have printing costs now, Mark being in the industry, you know, uh, Mark commits my layout
1831120	1835440	and design guy, he's got some great contacts and we've really got our printing costs, uh,
1835440	1839920	in check. I mean, we've got them way low, even if we could even get up to, and this is sort of
1839920	1845200	maybe a lofty goal right now, but over 10,000, a total of 10,000 per issues, it drops down to
1845200	1851520	about, uh, about 90 cents an issue or a print. And that's, uh, you know, 50 right now we're,
1851520	1855680	we're, we're going to, it's going to be a minimum of 52 pages, a high gloss page, and we're gonna
1855680	1860240	do a thick stock cover. Do you guys remember like a next generation magazine? Yeah. Yeah. I mean,
1860240	1864720	one of the last greatest magazines, uh, at least as far as I'm concerned, you know, and they always
1864720	1868800	had that thick cover and I've still got, you know, I think the first two years, uh, even at their
1868800	1873520	premiere issue, uh, up, up in my closet because I just can't throw them away. They're just too nice
1873520	1877200	and they're a resource. You know, they had lots of, uh, you know, it was kind of that first
1877200	1881200	magazine that was kind of geared more towards, uh, I'm not gonna say adults, but I mean,
1881200	1885920	older gamers kind of at the time. And it's just full of great information. The covers were so
1885920	1889840	high quality is like, it wasn't a magazine you just read and throw in the trash. I don't think.
1889840	1894160	And that's what we want to do. We want to do, you know, uh, kind of a thick stock cover. Um,
1894720	1899360	you know, and, uh, just, just something that's going to kind of be a resource and, uh, Mark,
1899360	1902560	you know, being the great guy is, you know, we're, we're, we put an update in there about,
1902560	1906480	you know, using environmentally conscious, you know, materials and everything, soy inks and,
1906480	1910560	and recyclable paper. But the thing is going to look beautiful. Um, but I mean,
1910560	1915360	those are all things that we're thinking about. Um, and, you know, thanks to Mark, you know,
1915360	1919760	for kind of coming on and being in the industry and kind of knowing where to go, uh, and, and
1919760	1923200	putting this whole thing together. He, the magazine is going to look as good as anything
1923200	1926160	you've ever seen. I can guarantee you that with him on board this thing. Well, I think there's
1926160	1929680	a lot of people out there that definitely kind of collected these sort of game magazines and
1929680	1934640	are probably really looking for something like this. Um, I know that, uh, part of the approach,
1934640	1938160	at least that I was getting from the Kickstarter page is that you don't necessarily want these
1938160	1942560	issues to feel dated. I know the Kickstarter page says, you're not really looking at covering the
1942560	1947440	current in gaming. Just because you call it retro doesn't mean it's retro only, but I'm getting the
1947440	1952800	sense that you want these magazines to have to not be dated or, or stuck to a certain month and year,
1952800	1956560	right? Yeah. Well, for sure. I mean, every magazine is going to cover everything. It's
1956560	1961520	going to be heavily weighted with retro, of course. Um, certainly any current generation games or, or,
1961520	1966160	or gaming, you know, topics that have some sort of a historical background or relevance, uh, we want
1966160	1970000	to talk about, um, you know, we're kind of going back and forth. That's not to say we won't, you
1970000	1975440	know, uh, review AAA titles, but I mean, what's the point of reviewing, you know, Call of Duty 12
1975440	1979040	of if every other magazine and every other website's already doing it, you know what I mean?
1979040	1984480	And so, you know, like I said, you may or may not see those types of, those types of things, you
1984480	1988000	know, uh, reviewed, you know, typically we're going to hopefully look for stuff that kind of
1988000	1992240	flies under the radar. Certainly the indie stuff is big right now and there's tons of innovation
1992240	1997680	there, even, you know, on the retro side and mobile, you know? Um, so you can expect console,
1997680	2002400	mobile, indie, uh, PC gaming, arcade and pinball. We got Kevin Steele in there from
2002400	2007120	Game Room Magazine going to bring up that end of it. Um, you know, we're going to cover it all,
2007120	2011200	you know, we're going to try to fit it into 52 pages. I'm thinking there's probably a
2011200	2015360	relatively good chance that this thing's going to increase to 60 pages, uh, when we start.
2015360	2018240	Well, that's one of your stretch goals, right? Is to try and thicken the magazine?
2018240	2021520	Yeah, yeah. We didn't really, that's one of the things we've been a little bit criticized over
2021520	2025680	kind of the, kind of the ambiguity behind the stretch goals. And right now, um, you know,
2025680	2029920	we don't really know, we know it's going to be a minimum of 52 pages and only four pages of ads.
2029920	2034240	So we want to keep it, you know, uh, lots of, you know, lots of in-depth features and stuff and
2034240	2040160	minimal on the ad space. Um, but you know, right now we've got so many people, uh, the, the trick
2040160	2044400	for us is going to be, you know, how do we juggle everybody? Is everybody in every issue? Uh, are
2044400	2048880	some people staggered, you know, every other issue, um, or do we just simply add more pages? And
2048880	2053120	honestly, that's what we'd want to do. Um, and I think we get up, you know, if we can get up over,
2053120	2057600	you know, to the sixties, you know, uh, our goal is 50,000, which really is what we've budgeted
2057600	2063840	as sort of a breakeven point to produce six 52 page issues. So if we can go, um, you know,
2063840	2067520	if we can get up to 60, 70,000, we'd like to add, you know, another four pages, you know,
2067520	2072000	four page increments, of course. Um, we get up to 60 pages and, and, uh, you know, maybe you get
2072000	2077440	into the 80 to 90 page range maybe before the year is over. Um, we've, we've got, I mean, we're,
2077440	2082240	there will be no shortage of content. I'll tell you that, um, these guys are already, you know,
2082240	2086080	coming up with some great ideas, uh, things they're going to be writing about. And I'm just
2086080	2090240	as excited as everybody else, uh, to be reading what all these people have to say. You're just
2090240	2094560	putting this all together. You can't wait to read it yourself. I can't. Yeah, I really can't. I've
2094560	2098400	been reading, you know, I mean, I grew up gaming in the seventies and, and, you know, electronic
2098400	2103440	games, the first kind of magazine dedicated to the hobby, um, you know, back in the early eighties,
2103440	2110480	um, and, um, you know, graduated into, you know, game fan and EGM and, and, uh, game pro like
2110480	2114240	everybody else did. You remember when game magazines used to be like 200 pages thick.
2114240	2117760	I do. You know, I mean, those, those were the days. I mean, those were just great days.
2117760	2123120	I also, I was really fond of, um, my first gaming system and I'm using my quotey fingers was really
2123120	2127440	a Commodore 64. So I remember, I remember the magazines that were like the really nice glossy
2127440	2131520	pages at the beginning and the back was more like newspaper. Cause it was all the type these into
2131520	2135440	your computer. Yeah. Right. Get these games type of thing. Yeah. I've got a Commodore 64 set up
2135440	2140560	here in the home arcade. Yeah. I mean, it's, you know, I collect, you know, that's part of the
2140560	2144560	reason I started game gavel, the auction site back in away, which is to give gamers a better place to
2144560	2148240	buy and sell. It's a lot cheaper than eBay, free listings, free seller stores. We've got tons of
2148240	2153040	great sellers on there. Um, and, uh, the plan. Um, and, and we're not going to bombard people
2153040	2156800	with game gavel in the magazine, but on the digital side, uh, well, first of all, if everybody
2156800	2160160	that buys the print subscription is going to get digital for free. Okay. So you're going to be able
2160160	2165920	to kind of get both. Um, the digital magazines, we will have, uh, maybe just a shopping cart icon.
2165920	2169120	So if you're reading about a game, you know, we'll put a shopping cart on there. If you click
2169120	2172960	the shopping cart, it'll pull up the listings and the auction site for all of the other gamers that
2172960	2177360	are, that are, that are selling that game, you know, and bringing people into the marketplace
2177360	2182080	to buy and sell. So that's kind of the plan, kind of integrating the commerce with the content,
2182080	2185440	at least with the digital. I was gonna say a little bit of synergy between your, your different
2185440	2189120	projects, but that's smart. I mean, there's nothing wrong with that. Uh, if you guys want
2189120	2193520	to consider donating to a retro, the throwback video game magazine, you can find that on
2193520	2198480	Kickstarter. It's a kickstarter.com slash projects slash. So Cal Mike, but it's probably easier to
2198480	2203760	just go to kickstarter.com and search for retro. Uh, some of the different various award tiers,
2203760	2208880	you can actually get, uh, for $7, the premiere issue of retro. If you want to look at a six
2208880	2215920	years, uh, one or six issue, excuse me, one year digital subscription, uh, you can kick back $12
2216000	2219520	for that, uh, dark soccer, very reasonable. Yeah. You had something dark soccer. Well,
2219520	2226480	you said you said the magic P word pinball. Yeah. So, um, that actually really, uh,
2226480	2230400	my husband and I collect pinball tables. Oh, right. And, um, we're down to three,
2231600	2235200	but we have a twilight zone. So that's what matters. What else do you guys have? Um,
2235200	2240800	we have world cup soccer 94, which was my favorite and, uh, jackpot. Oh, right. Yeah.
2240800	2246560	We actually got rid of no fear for jackpot, but, um, it was like, I know we actually have
2246560	2251280	hung out a few times with, uh, Steve Ritchie. Um, yeah, we know Steve. He's such a great guy.
2251280	2256800	Oh yeah. Uh, and he does the voices. That's so amazing. But, um, I was asking what I was
2256800	2260640	wondering about the pinball is if you were going to be, um, like doing interviews with stern and,
2260640	2265440	and covering some of the newer, uh, yeah. I mean, I, I mean, I know the stern, I noticed,
2265440	2269520	um, you know, we know stern real well. We know Jersey Jack real well. Um, you know,
2269520	2272960	they just came out with wizard of Oz and they're working, I think on their second table now.
2272960	2276640	Um, so yeah, I mean, anytime there's a new table out, we want to do, you know,
2276640	2280400	an in-depth review of that thing and, and, uh, you know, interview the designers behind it.
2280400	2284080	Uh, we just, uh, we've got great, you know, again, I've just got some great, uh,
2284080	2289200	great contacts going back, uh, um, you know, through, through the years and everything. And,
2289200	2294240	and, uh, we do, um, retro gaming round up podcast for about six years and every one of those shows,
2294240	2299200	we do a one to two hour interview with somebody, um, you know, famous, some old gaming, you know,
2300080	2304560	we did Al Alcorn and Ted Dabney, all the Activision guys, uh, Steve, I mean, uh,
2304560	2308880	some of the pinball folks. I mean, it, it goes on and on and on. We get all of our interviews
2308880	2312720	at classic gaming expo and Portland and the Portland show. We just went to, we got some
2312720	2316960	great interviews up there. Um, and a lot of those interviews can be transcribed into the
2316960	2321280	magazine as well. Just kind of preserved in print. Nice. Let me go to, let me go to chat
2321280	2325680	room with a couple of questions, uh, from live.vognetwork.com. Uh, I'll ask a couple
2325680	2329920	of these questions and then we'll wrap up here. Um, dark Tetsuya in our chat room says, uh,
2329920	2334800	out of all the names you got involved, who were you the most excited to get on board?
2335760	2340400	Um, boy, I would have to say, if I could answer too, well, I don't know. I'd have to say Jeremy
2340400	2345840	parish because, you know, Jeremy is, is such a consummate professional. He's just, he's a great
2345840	2350160	writer. Um, and people love Jeremy, you know, there's just something about him that, that
2350160	2356240	everybody loves. Um, uh, I hate to, you know, single anybody out. I mean, Sean baby, Chris
2356240	2362000	Kohler, Jeff green, uh, Andy Eddie, for God's sakes. Um, cat Bailey, Ryan Scott, Leonard Herman,
2362000	2366880	a big historian in, in the, uh, in the, um, you know, in the industry that writes just these great
2366880	2370560	books, you know, and, uh, what I'm excited about having Lenny on board is, is, you know, he, he
2370560	2375840	writes some of them. Are you familiar with, with Lenny Herman? Uh, the name doesn't ring a bell,
2375840	2378240	but it's probably one of those things when you tell me what he did. I'll be like, yes,
2378240	2381840	Leonard Herman and look at the books. I mean, he writes just some of the best books on the history
2381840	2386080	of gaming. And, uh, these are like, you know, five, 600 pages is a lot of times they're,
2386080	2389280	they're insane. And so what I'm excited about is, is there's a lot of young general, you know,
2389280	2393360	kind of the younger generation gamer who may not pick up, you know, a 500 page book on the industry
2393360	2398000	and the history of it. Um, but you know, if he can write, you know, four or five, six pages on a,
2398000	2402640	on a particular topic, um, you know, I think, I think kids will read it and, and really learn
2402640	2406000	something about the industry. And that's what we really want to do. We want to sort of preserve the
2406000	2409920	past and kind of look back and understand, you know, why the industry is what it is. I mean,
2409920	2413200	God, when it started, everybody thought it was gonna be a fad. I remember back in the
2413200	2417200	seventies and the eighties, you know, nobody knew it was going to be around for another 30 years.
2417200	2420640	I really love reading the stories from like the time when people were developing for the
2420640	2424400	Atari 2600, when it just sounded like, you know, it was so much pressure and it was like one or
2424400	2428480	two people. And it's such a different type of culture than what we see now. We had two days
2428480	2433520	to make Pac-Man. You know, I've, I'm always fascinated by that. And like really how it's
2433520	2437120	grown into these. Now you look at a game like Grand Theft Auto five and it's like, you know,
2437120	2441440	it's like shooting five movies all at the same time. It's so much. Yeah. I mean, it's,
2441440	2445280	it's really insane. It's really insane. But yeah, I'd have to say Jeremy, I was really glad
2445280	2449760	to get him on more, but, but not to just pick anybody. I'm, I'm just loving everybody that
2449760	2454080	we've assembled into this thing so far. And, and a lot of them, you know, have asked to get involved
2454080	2458160	with it after the fact. Nice. You know, which is great, which is sort of, uh, I think just
2458160	2462320	led some credibility to the idea of, of, uh, you know, everybody wants to be a part of this thing
2462320	2467920	and, uh, you know, getting the, getting all of this wisdom and, and history, uh, you know,
2467920	2472800	it packed into the pages of a single magazine, uh, has never been done before. Even on a website,
2472800	2476720	you know, there's not, there's not been a writing team like this assembled. So it's,
2476720	2481680	it's just a special thing. And, um, you know, we, uh, I think we got a long way to go. I mean, we're
2482240	2488800	you know, around 35% of goal right now. Uh, but you know, we got 20 days to go. That sounds like
2488800	2492080	it long time, but the days kind of keep ticking away. And I keep thinking to myself, you know,
2492400	2495200	the trend has kind of been down, but I've talked to people who run kickstarters. I don't know if
2495200	2498880	you guys know anybody or run into yourself, but it sounds like there's a little bit of a kind of
2498880	2503360	a smile or it kind of dips and goes down. And then, you know, people just wait. Cause you know,
2503360	2507040	I wait a lot of times on kickstarters. I'll wait till the last few days or the last week,
2507040	2511440	you know, and then, you know, there's a big kind of a surge of people kind of that last week.
2511440	2515600	And so, uh, yeah, we kind of hope it goes that way. I think the internet is kind of a funky
2515600	2520080	place too, where you kind of have to just catch that wave at the right moment where it hits and
2520080	2523840	it goes viral and then it's spreading everywhere. And then that's where your kickstarter is really
2523840	2529360	going to take off. So, um, I hope I, I, I'm not going to profess to be a very large organization
2529360	2533840	here at orange launch radio, other voice geeks network, but I hope we can do what we can here
2533840	2537200	by having you on tonight to bring awareness to it. Maybe, maybe cause a little bit of an uptick
2537200	2542800	with that. Um, again, if you guys want to look at a retro, you can check that out at kickstarter.com
2542800	2547200	and I'm also happy to spread the word around the pinball circles. Yeah, please do. I mean,
2547200	2551120	we, we want to definitely have, uh, you know, some pinball, uh, uh, content in every issue,
2551120	2554160	you know? Um, I think there's plenty of plenty of things to talk about.
2555120	2559120	Especially with the craziness of some of the tables that have just come out and are coming
2559120	2564240	out. Metallica was crazy. Have you seen Wizard of Oz? Yes, I did. I played it. Holy crap. That
2564240	2568560	thing was insane. It's crazy. And there's just so much going on. I was like, I'm about to go
2568560	2573760	into overload. I think I need to take a break. Yeah. It's a very impressive table. I like the
2573760	2578240	Tron table. I thought that was cool, but I'm a big nerd. I like the special edition Tron.
2578240	2582480	All right. Before I let Mike go, Mike, we always ask our guests this when they come on the show
2582480	2585760	and it may have nothing to do with the project that you're talking about, but we are a video
2585760	2591120	game show. We want to know what kind of games are you playing this week? Oh my gosh. Well,
2591120	2596640	I just picked up a missile command cocktail table here on the Craigslist here in LA
2597520	2603040	for a whopping $140. Super cheap for a cocktail table. That's great. Oh my gosh. I mean,
2603040	2606640	everybody, I got friends all over the country and you guys are in LA, right? Or Southern
2606640	2611840	California. We're in Sacramento. So we're about six hours north of you. Yeah. I drove up there.
2611840	2617360	I drove to Portland and spent a night on the way up in Sac. But I don't know what it is up north,
2617360	2623040	but down here, it's just sort of like a feeding friends. I mean, my friends are going nuts because
2623040	2627360	I find such great deals like on Craigslist, you know, they're like missile command, 140 bucks.
2627360	2632480	That would have been $500 in Virginia, you know? And so, yeah, I just picked that up
2632480	2637680	and I've been playing some, what was I playing today? I think Gradius 5 on the PS2. Nice.
2638400	2643600	Great game. I've got a little man cave down here, kind of home office where I've got,
2643600	2648560	you know, four arcade games. I got a Touchmaster hooked up. I got an Apple IIc and my Commodore's
2648560	2653920	hooked up. I got about 90 Commodore cartridges and I play that all the time. So you don't just
2653920	2659840	talk the talk with this retro stuff. You walk the walk as well. Yeah, no, man. I'm in deep. Thank
2659840	2664320	God my wife loves to play games as well. So that's how my husband and I got together.
2664320	2666320	A last thing here, Dark Soccer, you had one more thing.
2667520	2674400	I actually was just thinking of imagined if our two vaults combined, it would totally
2674400	2679600	explode the world. Dark Soccer and Her Abbey have a huge gaming vault as well that just like all
2679600	2684240	this stuff. So I want to go play all this stuff now, but you were actually asking about a little
2684240	2688960	bit about what the market is up here. For a lot of the retro games, they're actually quite expensive
2688960	2693680	and it's easy for us to go to the Bay Area too. It's not unreasonable. But especially in the
2693680	2698720	pinball market, for example, our Twilight Zone about maybe five years ago, we could have gotten
2698720	2703920	about three grand for it. We could easily get six. Right. Yeah. Well, that's one of the greats.
2703920	2709120	Yeah. All right. Well, I got to wrap up and let Mike go. Mike, thanks so much for your time here.
2709120	2713120	Thank you guys so much. I really appreciate the opportunity to tell your listeners about this.
2713120	2716960	No worries. And best of luck with the project. You know, one thing I don't think I really got
2716960	2720160	out there during the interview is that we love that you're taking an indie approach to it.
2720720	2723280	We've always been fiercely independent here at Orange Lawn Trader. You know,
2723280	2726880	we've been doing what we do here since 2002. Yeah. Amazing.
2726880	2730400	Yeah. For 11 plus years. Before a podcast even was a podcast.
2731520	2735360	Yes, actually. Yeah. We were a live 365 show for a couple of years before that.
2735360	2736960	Oh, right. We tell all the kids to get off our lawn.
2736960	2741840	But yeah, I mean, we love that you guys are keeping it independent with this. Even if
2741840	2746480	you are bringing in people who are kind of paid behind the big budget stuff,
2746480	2750000	you're kind of at least getting them outside of that element for this indie production.
2750000	2753680	I think that's fantastic. It's great because they're going to, I think that, I mean,
2753680	2757360	these guys aren't used to writing and kind of this type of environment. I think I mentioned
2757360	2760640	that one of the updates that, you know, they're used to working for these big media companies
2760640	2765280	all the time. And so, I'm hoping that, you know, they're on a long leash. I'll tell you that. I
2765280	2767760	mean, really, they're not on any kind of a leash. I mean, I don't know what they're going to be
2767760	2771840	writing about. You know, we'll obviously kind of nail some of that down as we move forward
2771840	2776400	to building the first issue. But I really think that they're going to talk about things and write
2776400	2779440	maybe just a little bit differently in this environment than they would normally write,
2779440	2783520	you know, working for Future US or WriteGN or, you know, one of these big companies.
2783520	2788640	So, I'm just really excited to kind of give them the freedom to kind of write what they want to
2788640	2794560	write about, how they want to write. A new side of some of your favorite video game authors.
2794640	2800320	Yeah. Hey, one last thing too. Speaking of Live 365, I also do a retroarcaderadio.com. It's just
2800320	2806320	24 hours a day, live streaming, retro gaming related music and old vintage commercials.
2807040	2810400	You guys are interested in that. It's been going on. I've been running that for about
2810400	2816160	five or six years as well. So, retroarcaderadio.com, but it's a Live 365 station as well.
2817280	2821680	Hey, they served a great purpose for us for many years until we decided to branch out. So,
2821680	2825680	but yeah, that's awesome. That sounds like a great thing to do when you're playing your
2825680	2830560	Commodore 64 with 90 cartridges and all this other crazy stuff you have. So, that's awesome.
2830560	2835280	Well, best of luck with your various projects. That's retroarcaderadio.com?
2835280	2836480	Retroarcaderadio.com.
2836480	2840080	Retroarcaderadio.com. Okay. So, you got retroarcaderadio.com,
2840080	2845600	gamegavel.com and soon retro game magazine or whatever domain you get for this.
2845600	2846000	Yep.
2846000	2848960	Dot com as well. You're a busy guy, Mike. Best of luck with all your projects.
2848960	2849600	Thank you so much.
2849600	2852240	Thank you for taking the time out to be with us here at OLR tonight. Have a great night.
2852240	2853360	All right. Bye guys.
2853360	2856640	All right. Bye-bye. Wow. That was awesome.
2856640	2857840	You should be our new best friend.
2860400	2863440	You want to be his best friend. No, I liked him. He seemed well enough,
2863440	2866800	but you guys definitely have the retro pinball. That same same's there.
2866800	2868800	Well, just a moment he said pinball is like, bing.
2869760	2873680	Well, you don't get any of that in any of the current publications really,
2873680	2878640	unless it's specifically pinball. And I mean, especially now with, you know,
2879280	2883040	for example, that wizard of Oz table has such a heavy video element with it
2883760	2887760	that, or all the pinball 2000 that had the screens.
2888640	2894640	You're dealing with a pinball and video game, you know, a digital game combined
2894640	2897680	that isn't baby Pac-Man. But I still love baby Pac-Man.
2897680	2899840	I still love baby Pac-Man. I love me some baby Pac-Man.
2899840	2903200	All right. Best of luck to those guys. One more time. You can search for that on kickstarter.com.
2903200	2906720	It is retro and I'll probably contribute a little bit for that effort. I think,
2907280	2910720	I think it's a fine, uh, idea they've got over there. And I would,
2910720	2913440	I would not mind having some more magazines to put on the shelves.
2913440	2915520	Maybe this will take my Kickstarter virginity.
2916080	2919120	Ooh. Okay. That's right. You've never donated to a Kickstarter.
2919120	2922400	Because my Amazon payments weren't working every time I freaking try.
2922400	2925360	All right. So by the way, before we move on to the rest of our gaming weeks,
2925360	2928400	I did want to point out over in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com,
2928400	2932560	uh, there wasn't, uh, there was a lot of other chatter that weren't just question for
2932560	2937440	questions for Mike. Uh, but there was chalk going on there about like some other gaming magazine,
2937440	2940160	you know, memories. And we're going to get into that with our Fugu question of the week later,
2940160	2944160	but I did want to point out for dark soccer, a code man was offering to go get high with
2944160	2949200	you on some CMYK fumes. Oh yeah. I, I think I actually started that.
2949200	2955600	There you go. I'm sorry. If you, if you are a print design person, there is no smell as
2955600	2962640	wonderful as stepping into a print shop and smelling the toxic fumes. I have to tell you
2962640	2967200	that traditional ink smells a lot different than the soy ink. And I don't know what I like better.
2968320	2972480	Just saying. Have you smelled a print shop on weed?
2974000	2978640	All right, Loki. Uh, it's time to get over to your gaming week. When we left off, we'd heard
2978640	2981600	it from dark soccer. Let's get into your gaming week and the types of games you've been playing
2981600	2985120	this week. Well, it's really only one type of game. I've been playing Grand Theft Auto five.
2985360	2990720	I did play a little bit of online cause I was trying to catch up my Xbox, uh, 360 character
2991520	2998560	to my PS3 character. So I managed to get up to level 10 on my 360 character. And then I decided,
2998560	3003760	um, uh, well, one night I was trying to play with Bobby, but he kept getting stuck in like
3003760	3008800	full games and I couldn't join his game. So I ended up just going back to single player
3008800	3012000	and trying to finish my a hundred percent stuff. So that's what I've been doing since,
3012560	3021920	uh, earlier this week. And I'm now 82% complete. I think I started, I'm pretty much almost done
3021920	3029600	with the Epsilon program missions and, um, what else did I do? Oh, I finished all the, uh,
3029600	3036640	triathlons, which seriously, rock stars, seriously. There's a 30 minute fucking long triathlon,
3036640	3044080	30 minutes in real time of mashing a mashing a for 30 fucking that sounds about as awesome as
3044080	3050080	desert bus. I, that is so fucking, oh, it's almost as, almost as fun as the part in Epsilon,
3050080	3055520	uh, missions where you have to run for five miles. So I was sitting there running in circles for
3055520	3063920	about 20 minutes that that was fun. Also mashing a for like a while. Um, and then what else? So,
3064240	3072160	all the races and, um, I think I'm pretty much, I have a buying property and I don't know pretty
3072160	3077600	much. I just have to do a lot of the collectibles and stunt jumps and the planes under the bridges
3077600	3083440	and stuff. Um, so I have to finish that and I think that'll be about it. Um, now much left to
3083440	3087040	go, but I'm going to still work on that. But later this week though, we are going to be doing a vog
3087040	3093200	or two vog gaming nights for grant the thought online one day on PlayStation three, one day on
3093200	3098240	X-Box three 60. So stay tuned the forums. I'm thinking right now that it's going to be Friday,
3098240	3104400	Saturday. I just have to make sure it doesn't conflict with any shows. That's about it.
3104960	3108560	Uh, as long as it's not Saturday night when us L is on, you should be good.
3109680	3112640	If you do it a little earlier in the night, Saturday, Saturday should be fine.
3112640	3117360	Maybe in the middle of week then. Yeah, we'll see. All right. Just stay tuned to the, uh,
3117360	3121200	forums. We have a thread in the forums and I'll put times there. So sounds good.
3121840	3127520	All right. Uh, my gaming week, uh, I told you all about the, uh, show, uh, that I did on yesterday.
3127520	3131760	So, um, that took a big bite out of most of my gaming time this week, just like last week,
3131760	3136000	unfortunately. Uh, so I'm going to get caught up this week. I did play a little bit of final
3136000	3140960	fantasy 14. Um, not as much as you'd think based on what I said last week. Um, I was fortunate
3140960	3145520	enough to get into hearthstone beta, which is a blizzards, a free to play trading card game.
3145520	3149200	Uh, I talked a little bit about this at length on the hoard house. I'll kind of repeat some of
3149200	3154080	that here. Um, I did enjoy the game well enough, especially for something that's free to play.
3154080	3159440	I found the gameplay to be a little bit basic, but some card game affectionados who know this stuff
3159440	3164000	a little more than I do, uh, seem to really enjoy it and kind of find the depth in it that I'm
3164000	3168800	currently, I guess not seeing or whatever. I was really surprised kind of like that you draw so
3168800	3173920	few cards and it's really like, you know, the man is all just kind of built in. You don't have cards
3173920	3177920	on your own for that or whatever. So, um, but I guess the easy to play thing is really to try to
3177920	3182400	draw in as many people as possible. And kind of my final verdict on hearthstone from what I've
3182400	3186560	played on it so far is that I think it's going to be a great tablet game. And I really look forward
3186560	3190240	to it on tablets because I like the idea of just kind of being able to like, you know, lie in bed
3190240	3194720	before I go to sleep and, you know, play around with just the touch controls. But if I'm sitting
3194720	3200240	down at my PC, I kind of think there's other games I might want to play that, that really aren't
3200240	3206080	hearthstone. Um, one of those games I would want to play is a game I did get a chance to check out
3206080	3210960	quickly this week, which is audio surf 2. Now this game is still in development. It's something
3210960	3215360	that's on steam early access. So I don't want to review the game per se. I just kind of want to
3215360	3220560	say, Hey, it's out there. You can check it out. Uh, one of the big differences I'm noticing between
3220560	3225040	audio surf 2 and audio surf 1, which is a game I really enjoyed too. And if you haven't played
3225040	3232000	audio surf 1, um, it's a game that uses your own music too. And then the first game you had these
3232000	3236640	different modes, but like the main mode was sort of like, you would pick up these colored blocks
3236640	3242800	as you would speed down a tunnel, uh, that is set to whatever your song is. And it kind of, kind of
3242800	3246960	was like clacks. I don't know if any of you remember that nineties puzzler clacks, remember
3246960	3250000	that where they come down the conveyor belt, the colored pieces would come down the conveyor belt
3250000	3255040	and you try to match three match five. You kind of tried to do that really quick and audio surf,
3255040	3260560	but audio surf had a mode that I thought was way better called the mono mode where it was just
3260560	3264880	pick up, you know, the pieces are black or white and it's just about navigating and being able to
3264880	3270480	move through the field as fast as possible. So you pick up only the pieces that are colorful and not
3270480	3275680	the pieces that are, you know, the wrong color. Um, so I like that mode the best. And it seems
3275680	3279760	like they're trying to kind of capitalize on that a little bit in audio surf 2, at least the modes
3279760	3284000	that are in there right now is kind of the mono mode, but the mode I really like, one of the
3284000	3288000	things they have in there right now is, is like a, um, it's like, Oh, I remember the name of it.
3288080	3292640	It was like a wave race type of mode, because what you can do is that like, let's say, you know,
3292640	3297120	you're about to go down a big hill because when the tempo of the song picks up, you start to go
3297120	3301360	down a hill. Well, what you do is you swing your character all the way to a side of the side of
3301360	3305760	the tunnel and click the mouse button and they'll like fly up in the air. And then you're flying
3305760	3310000	down the hill and you do tricks in the air. And then you kind of land like, it's like,
3310000	3313360	like you're in like a jet ski type thing and you do these tricks. And I thought that was a really
3313360	3318960	cool little innovation. And that's like, I, the way that plays and feels because, you know,
3319520	3323120	that's when the crescendos of the music happens. So to kind of do like this whole, like,
3323120	3326960	right when the crescendo of a big dance song hits, like boom, I'm going to go flying in the
3326960	3331440	air and do all these tricks. Like it's, it's really rewarding in that sort of way. So, um,
3332320	3336480	yeah, I'm, I'm liking what I'm seeing of audio surf 2 so far, I guess one of the other big
3336480	3340480	things they're going to do with it is mods. They want to have more and more mods and user created
3340480	3346240	stuff. I imagine this is going to be a part of that steam, uh, what do they call this steam
3346240	3350000	community marketplace or something like that, where people can make their own stuff like they
3350000	3354160	have with Skyrim and civilization and stuff. I can't imagine this game isn't going to incorporate
3354160	3360080	that big time. So, uh, yeah, I am looking forward to seeing what further develops audio surf too,
3360080	3363840	but that's pretty much been my gaming week is just those games. Otherwise I've been pretty busy
3364400	3368880	with other stuff. So let's get into some housekeeping and then we'll get into the news
3368880	3372720	tonight. Uh, for tonight's housekeeping, I did want to mention quickly because I forgot to
3372720	3379520	mention last week. Um, I, uh, was on a, another show, uh, the let's wow podcast last week,
3379520	3384080	episode 31 that is now on the feed. But when I was talking about that, I forgot to plug,
3384080	3389600	uh, gamut's stream that he's doing this Tuesday on into Wednesday, he's going to be doing a 24
3389600	3395120	hour live stream for charity. He's raising money for breast cancer awareness month. He's trying to,
3395360	3398800	you know, kind of bring attention to that, especially because, uh, world of Warcraft
3398800	3403120	has such a huge community behind it and the online gaming stuff in general. I think, uh, you know,
3403120	3407760	it's a great way to kind of say, Oh, Hey, while you're playing these games, don't forget that
3407760	3413120	there's this type of awareness going on in the real world. And, you know, uh, cancer really sucks
3413120	3417760	and we have to keep fighting it and raising money through research. So, um, I think that's really
3417760	3421600	cool that he's doing this video game, uh, live stream to support that. Uh, so I want to give
3421600	3426640	that a plug. You can check out more information on his website, gamuthunts.com. Uh, and he'll be
3426640	3432720	streaming that on his Twitch channel on Tuesday. Uh, otherwise the only other thing I can think of
3432720	3439040	to plug here is that of course we are on Twitter, twitter.com slash O L R. We're also on Facebook,
3439040	3446240	facebook.com slash orange lounge radio. And, uh, I think that's it. That's all I've got to plug
3446240	3451440	right now. So I guess we should get into some news. Loki. All right. So, um, let's talk a
3451440	3459520	little bit about, um, new devices coming out and you may remember we talked briefly about the Mojo,
3459520	3464320	which I think is pretty cool. The Mad Catz micro console that's going to have Android games and
3464320	3469760	stuff on it. What's kind of unique about it is that it can actually play normal Android games.
3469760	3476160	It's not a separate marketplace. You can actually map the controls and stuff. The only problem with
3477120	3483120	it though is it's $250. Um, but yeah, so they announced $250. It's up for pre-order. Ships in
3483120	3490640	December, tentatively. Um, some of the specs on it. It's going to be, uh, it's going to have 16
3490640	3501040	gigabytes of storage with a micro SD, uh, support. Also they have, um, I guess, uh, a 1.8 gigahertz
3501120	3506160	Tegra 4 processor. So it's definitely more powerful than like say an Ouya and it comes
3506160	3512000	with a special, um, uh, controller that's Bluetooth enabled, which allows you to also,
3512800	3518560	uh, I guess use it on like Android or as a PC controller or even use like mouse input and stuff.
3519360	3523840	Um, so that's pretty cool. And then one of the other cool things that you can do with this,
3523840	3529760	and I guess it kind of helps warrant the $250 price point is that you can actually stream PC
3529760	3535520	games with it. So that's going to be coming, I think after it launches. Um, and it's going to
3535520	3540800	wait a minute. Loki, isn't that supposed to be the steam machines thing? Well, technically, yeah,
3540800	3546720	I guess it could be, but, um, I think it's kind of cool. Uh, they've got, let's see,
3546720	3556000	here's some more specs on the Mojo, uh, two gigs of Ram and, um, one USB 2.0 and one USB 3.0 port.
3556000	3563080	I mean, that's pretty cool that it supports that Bluetooth 4.0 and it's running Android 4.22. Um,
3564880	3568880	and they even have a headphone socket on there. So that's kind of cool. You can listen to your
3568880	3575760	audio through that. Um, I don't know. I think for the, for 250 bucks and it can stream games
3575760	3581920	to your TV. That's kind of cool. If it was just strictly an Android box, um, that probably
3581920	3588560	wouldn't be worth it for 250 bucks. So I don't know. What would you think would make, make it
3588560	3594880	worth the cost for 250 bucks? It's going to do a lot more than just, you know, play Android games.
3594880	3601040	I think, um, the controller looks nice at least. It's just, you mean you can, I guess a lot of
3601040	3606240	people have their phones and stuff and it would cost a lot less to probably just get an HDMI out
3606240	3611280	on your phone or get some other type of streaming thing. Uh, since it does support Android, I
3611280	3617200	suppose you could also use this as like a box to watch Netflix or Hulu or anything like that on.
3617200	3622880	Um, so there's just my living room needs another Netflix device. I don't have any of those. Some
3622880	3627840	people don't have a lot of stuff or some people might want a second one or third or fourth or
3627840	3633760	whatever. Um, and plus it looks kind of nice. I mean, it's shiny. It's got blue light on front.
3633760	3638080	I don't normally purchase my consoles based on lights, but it definitely looks better.
3639040	3646240	Um, 57 LEDs. I think the price was a little expensive. Maybe if it comes down to price
3646240	3651040	later on, it might be worth it for me. But, um, I just don't need any more consoles right now,
3651920	3659200	but the controller looks nice. I mean, if I could use on 360 or a PS3, I might be down with that.
3660320	3665200	All right. Well, uh, going to some stories about the Xbox one happening out there, uh, there was,
3666160	3671040	so a lot of talk this week about, uh, you know, there's been a lot of talk about the connect
3671040	3674960	and privacy and all that, you know, ever since they announced the whole always on thing, there
3674960	3679120	was the concerns about privacy. Well, I don't think it's even necessarily that it's more ever
3679120	3683120	since they announced, you know, all that, all that stuff leaking out and no Microsoft's in bed with
3683120	3687680	the NSA type thing. Well, yeah, yeah. But I mean, this is even really about that, but it's been on
3687680	3691760	people's minds because of that ever since they announced the system. And, uh, this was kind of
3691840	3695200	an interesting, uh, development on that this week. Uh, I'm going to totally pronounce this
3695200	3700240	name, so I apologize, but it's Yusuf Mehdi, who is the corporate vice president of marketing and
3700240	3704400	strategy for Microsoft was talking to the national advertisers, masters of marketing conference.
3704400	3708960	This is happening in Phoenix, uh, earlier this week, he was talking about some of the, uh,
3708960	3713600	things that the Xbox one could do that could actually affect marketing and how it's going to be,
3713600	3719440	um, even bigger than the PlayStation four in terms of the marketing. And this would have to do with,
3719680	3725040	Xbox's imaging technology, uh, talking about moving the gamification movement along and
3725040	3729680	advertise me. And if you haven't heard that term gamification before, uh, you know, it's
3729680	3734800	making games out of advertising, like, you know, interactive flash type things. Uh, the fact that
3734800	3739760	like, like, uh, take a social app, like four square is gamifying social media by, you know,
3739760	3743920	you check in, you get points, there's the mayor ship, there's all that. That's all gamification
3743920	3750400	because games are fun. Look at vog network.com gamified, uh, a radio network of independent
3750400	3754000	podcasts and kind of made a game out of that. That's, that's gamification. The catch pull ones.
3754000	3758720	We have to park the car to get your catch. Yes. Which we actually use on vog network.com,
3758720	3763520	which is a fun one. Yeah. Or reverse the people who use their advertising as a catch.
3764480	3769120	Oh yeah. Where you have to type in like, you know, the product, what product is blah, blah, blah.
3769120	3773360	Just do it. You know, you have to type in the slogan or whatever, but anyway, uh, talking about
3773360	3779360	also consolidating, uh, more attention that's diffused otherwise on multiple devices. Uh,
3779360	3785200	X-Box one will make it easier to port real time fantasy football data into the TV screen as people
3785200	3789920	watch their NFL games. It does sound kind of interesting. I know some people that are really
3789920	3795120	into fantasy football and I could sort of see that with a connects going to help do that. Well,
3795120	3799920	the X-Box one does that because it's that whole like connect supposed to do that. You can watch
3800000	3804240	the TV and like the three quarters window and then around the edge kind of has your game,
3804240	3808320	gamify or whatever. Yeah. But I'm just trying to figure out how the connect is actually
3808320	3813520	going to enhance something that basically I could feed into it. Normally I'm just saying like,
3813520	3819600	unless is it going to recognize that, you know, say I'm following me on my team of players because
3819600	3825920	it knows my face. And so that's going to display that stat, those stats. And I don't know. Well,
3825920	3832640	anyway, some of this chat led people to believe that, uh, Oh, they're going to harvest ad data
3832640	3838400	through the connect. But, uh, Microsoft came out after all of this and said, hold on, no, no,
3838400	3844560	this is not what we're doing. Uh, and, uh, yeah, this just said, nobody is working on that. That's
3844560	3848880	not something that happened. It is not going to happen without the user having control over it.
3848880	3853200	But see, here's my opinion. They can say this until they're blue in the face,
3853200	3859440	but this ultimately becomes an issue of, do you trust Microsoft? And that can be very frustrating
3859440	3863120	for a company like Microsoft. Like we're not doing it. Why won't people believe us?
3864000	3868720	But there's some people out there that have that distrust question. That corporate stuff
3868720	3873600	probably comes from the fact that there's all these dirty rumors out there of all these
3873600	3877120	horrible things that Microsoft could possibly be doing. And then they came out and said,
3877120	3881760	yep, we're going to do all that. And then Sony said, Nope, we're not going to do all that.
3881760	3886000	And then Microsoft said, no, we're actually not going to do that now. And we're not going to do
3886000	3888960	that now. And we're not going to do that now because, because you people don't like it,
3889920	3893840	but we may implement those features in the future. You know, it's just,
3895760	3900320	you know, it's a whole flip-flopping that makes people kind of unwary about that stuff.
3900320	3909040	Um, I think, I mean, what was kind of, I don't know, I guess concerning would have been the
3909040	3913600	features that, okay, we can recognize individual people. We can cater ads based on those people
3913600	3918080	that are, happen to be sitting in front of, you know, the screen. We can recognize, you know,
3918080	3922080	whether they're looking at the ad because we can see where their eyes are looking or something
3922080	3926560	like that, you know, or, you know, they're how long they're engaged in watching that.
3926560	3931360	Some of this has to do with patents too. Like, you know, and, and it causes a lot of buzz going
3931360	3936240	on through. Cause I remember when was it wasn't Microsoft that has that patent for, it can detect
3936240	3941280	like who is actually watching the film and lock the person who's not the owner out of watching
3941280	3945680	the movie or see like if there's more than 10 people watching the movie that, you know,
3945680	3949440	it could charge a different rate or something like that. And people really ran with that patent,
3949440	3953360	even though it's just a patent. It's not something that they're actually necessarily thinking about
3953360	3956880	doing. I don't remember. I apologize if I'm misrepresenting the facts. I don't remember
3956880	3960960	if that was Microsoft or Sony. I'm pretty sure it was Microsoft, but we have a live chat. I'm
3960960	3964960	sure I'll get corrected here in a minute if I was wrong, but I seem to recall that was an issue like
3965040	3970560	a year ago on the show gamification of stuff with connect and like these stupid interactive ads and
3970560	3975280	stuff through connect on the Microsoft. Well, it's funny, funny you say that. Cause Tiger
3975280	3979680	Claude chat at live.hognetwork.com says you think they'll have achievements just for watching an ad
3980640	3983760	and a dark soccer. You're responding to him in chat, talking about Gaia online,
3983760	3988480	which kind of does something like that. Yeah. You like get Gaia gold for doing surveys and
3988480	3992400	watching their stupid little ads. I used to do Gaia back in the day. Well, I think, okay,
3992400	3997760	well maybe Microsoft doesn't necessarily have that yet, but you got achievements from playing
3997760	4003040	those Burger King games. There was achievements in Yaris, which was an adver game, but Burger King
4003040	4007520	games were just genius. I actually get the Burger King games were really like, and I'm very
4007520	4012320	disappointed that there's no new Burger King games because they were, they were creepy in their own
4012320	4018400	way and it was just, it was fun. But besides, besides all of that, uh, I also think though
4018400	4022240	that, you know, Microsoft has said there's going to be an achievement for like day one
4022240	4027520	Xbox purchasing, like a day one adopter. So, I mean, that might not be advertising per se,
4027520	4031440	but they are definitely willing to put achievements in things that are not games.
4033200	4037280	Well, they are there. I think they were talking about like TV watching and stuff like that is
4037280	4042160	part of an achievement. Plus remember now Xbox rewards and stuff, they give you rewards for
4042160	4045840	doing different things. Who's to say they couldn't give you rewards for watching ads.
4046240	4051520	Code man in our chat room at live.thognetwork.com says it's not that we need less marketing. It's
4051520	4057920	that we need more less annoying marketing. Well, let me ask this tough question. What is that?
4057920	4063120	Then what, what is marketing that is not annoying? I think that's a tough question to answer because
4063120	4068320	I think whenever a lot of people feel like they're being kind of like pandered to or marketed to,
4068320	4072800	they might feel a little bit annoyed. So what's not annoying? I actually don't mind product
4073520	4078080	placement in a game or in a movie as long as it's not obtrusive.
4079280	4084240	Like, you know, the billboards and crazy taxis, what I think of, or take me to KFC, you know,
4084240	4088480	like I didn't, I wasn't annoyed with that. I actually found it funny. It was kind of funny
4088480	4092720	or, you know, it's stuff that you see in real life. You know, you're driving through the town,
4092720	4098000	you may see an ad for, you know, like a racing game. They have all the Valvoline and
4098000	4101600	Ferrelli and all that, you know, that's what you see at an actual racing track.
4101600	4108080	That's realistic advertising in the game. Or, you know, for example, character walks into,
4108080	4115600	you know, a snack room and goes to a Pepsi machine and gets a Diet Pepsi. That's unobtrusive
4115600	4119200	marketing. That's something that would happen in real life. It all depends. I mean, I've seen
4119200	4122640	people complain about that kind of stuff in, you know, games where they'll have, you know,
4123200	4128240	Mountain Dew or something. And it's like, so you're 22 or five or something ridiculous,
4128240	4131760	you know, in the future. And there's all these Mountain Dew machines everywhere.
4131760	4137120	I think like, if you want to do, I think people need to feel, because right now they feel, okay,
4137120	4143040	we're being charged for online. And now we're also being advertised to at the same time, because
4143040	4148000	look at the PlayStation network. They don't really have ads all over the place on the PlayStation,
4148000	4151920	you know, cross media bar. There's not ads. I mean, there's a little advertisement ticker
4151920	4155920	thing in the corner. We're talking about sales and stuff and games coming up, but it's not like
4155920	4160320	a Doritos commercial or something like that. Your system defaults to what's new and it might show,
4160320	4163680	like it'll show things that you own, but it'll also show things that are in the marketplace
4163680	4167200	in there, but that's not terrible. But that's, that's not really that bad.
4167200	4172880	But Microsoft though, they have fucking little tiles with, you know, ads in them. And a lot of
4172880	4176960	people think, well, wait a second. And especially, you know, just comparing stuff in the current gen
4176960	4184560	marketplace, you have Microsoft that's charging for online, Sony that's not charging for online.
4184560	4189680	There's no ads there. And Microsoft on top of charging you, they're also throwing ads in your
4189680	4195200	face, whether it be in the corner of the screen and you don't necessarily have to see it, you
4195200	4200880	know, but it's still there. And people are like, what the fuck? You know, aren't you getting enough
4200880	4205680	money from me already? And now you're making ad dollars on top of that. And so that's kind of
4205680	4210560	where the problem is. Xenocore in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says beer commercials are
4210560	4214640	awesome marketing. Most interesting man in the world is awesome marketing. You know, that kind
4214640	4218320	of had me thinking is that, well, you know, it is very interesting when we talk about marketing
4218320	4222800	vices, especially things like beer, you know, who has traditionally had, you know, Budweiser has
4222800	4227120	had some of the like biggest commercials you can possibly think of out there in history.
4227120	4230800	And then I kind of think of, you know, what's really fascinating. And this is kind of an
4230800	4234800	unpopular opinion. I'm not saying it's good. I'm just saying it's fascinating is that look at the
4234800	4238880	history of cigarette advertising, because those people are having stones. Well, those people
4238880	4245440	are having to advertise something that they know kills people. So it's, it's, it's really amazing
4245440	4250880	to see how they market that. Well, have you looked into the history of cigarette marketing?
4250880	4255440	Not like professionally, but I just, I can think of what I saw when I was a kid, back when there
4255440	4260880	were vending machines and restaurants and what I see now, they used to do Marlboro ads featuring
4260880	4265200	the Flintstones. It was like Marlboro tastes good, like a cigarette should. And then they
4265200	4272880	would have doctor endorsements in magazines prior to the sixties. They would have actual written
4272880	4278480	doctor endorsements for cigarettes being good for you. You know, and of course, you know, now
4278480	4283280	truth in advertising is a really, really big thing. So of course we don't have that anymore,
4283280	4290320	nor do we have the television ads. Or the old, although I have seen those little vending machines
4290320	4295120	repurposed. I have too. Yeah. That's kind of funny how they'll put those old cigarette
4295120	4300560	machines to use. There's a, I think at the Crocker museum, they actually do, um, replicas of some of
4300560	4305840	the art pieces or, or it's small scale or the flip because they don't really make cigarette vending
4305840	4309760	machines anymore. At least not in California. Like if you go to a bar where they do sell cigarettes
4309760	4313120	in the outdoor area, which is the only place you can smoke. It's like the type of vending machine
4313120	4318560	that sells chips and cookies in other places with a little, it's, it's fascinating to me.
4318560	4322960	I miss the old cigarette machine aesthetic, even if I don't agree with the product. Yeah, yeah,
4322960	4329200	yeah. No, the old cigarette machine, I should say that kind of cool, but like the knob and outcome,
4329200	4335440	your smoke, but that's also marketing in a way. And it's, it's cigarettes that are,
4335440	4340080	you're not supposed to be having, but keep in mind this happened. Remember what I mentioned
4340080	4348160	about the Crocker. They're using an almost a cultural artifact that we once associated with
4348160	4352960	cigarettes. We know it's a, its purpose is to sell you something. Instead of selling you
4352960	4359360	something harmful is selling you something beautiful. Although art is relative. Anyway,
4359360	4364000	anyhow, we're getting a little off track here a little, but, uh, yeah, advertising, um,
4364800	4368800	who knows what's going to develop in the future as, as entertainment gets more and more and more
4368800	4373280	interactive, uh, they'll come up with something. Anyhow, Dark Sakura, before we get to release
4373280	4379040	dates. Oh man, rage nator. I am not going to quote Dennis Larry except for, uh, what is it?
4379040	4385200	You, you have the, you, how about life's going to suck when you grow up, when you have the orgasm,
4385200	4388080	you smoke the, but you eat a cookie, you go to bed and that's the end of the story
4389280	4396000	about what the meaning of happiness anyway. So, um, oh yeah. And the, uh, I only want to eat
4396000	4402160	meat from cows that smoke. Oh, okay. Video games, Silent Hill. How about Silent Hill?
4404240	4408000	I'm going to have to smoke just to get through that game. My God. Just kidding.
4408560	4415120	Don't you know that's what the fog is. So anyway, um, way forward, um, did Silent Hill
4415120	4420720	book of memories. And, uh, it turns out though that before they did Contra four that they were,
4420720	4428240	um, they had a prototype out for, um, a, uh, another Silent Hill game for the Nintendo DS
4428880	4434400	and their little prototype starred, um, the dude from Silent Hill two. And it had, uh,
4434400	4438560	there was some video out about it, about, you know, what it was supposed to, to look like.
4438560	4444000	But of course that got canceled and they also had, and this makes me think back to the whole,
4444000	4452800	um, biohazard, uh, 1.5 where, um, they had a completely different version of Silent Hill book
4452800	4459840	of memories and ended up, I suppose, scrapping it and doing it what we have now. But, uh,
4459840	4464880	the, um, quote on there was saying is that they had, uh, two different perspectives for in the
4464880	4472000	game. This one would switch between an isometric and an over the shoulder. And they were looking
4472000	4479280	more at the combat and puzzle, uh, elements, um, to zoom out, but they said that the technology
4479280	4485520	just wasn't there to do it. So they switched how they did it. Um, but there is a video out
4485520	4491520	there of what the, uh, I'd say original concept of chain of memories was for anyone who's interested
4491520	4498560	in it, which for me, I love, um, I love looking at prototypes and the differences. I would still
4498560	4504560	love to find a playable, um, biohazard 1.5 just so that I could see for myself what the differences
4504560	4510480	were. But I love when they come out and say, well, this is what you almost got unless what
4510480	4515280	we almost got would have been better. You know what I mean? But I wouldn't have minded having a
4515280	4522800	good, um, solid Silent Hill game on my DS. Yeah. Book of memories got a lot of kind of hate though.
4522800	4526960	It wasn't it. See the thing with book of memories, like I didn't hate the game, but it wasn't
4526960	4531600	Silent Hill to me. It was very much not Silent Hill to me, which it was definitely like more of
4531600	4536080	like a spinoff type of game. I haven't wanted to play a Silent Hill game since homecoming.
4536720	4541360	I think honestly think that homecoming is the last, I'm not even going to say great Silent
4541360	4547680	Hill game. It's one of the last good faithful Silent Hill games to me. So. All right. Well,
4547680	4551120	let's travel around the world and check out release dates of games that will, you know,
4551120	4556080	actually be coming out. You know, it's pretty good that that Silent Hill game didn't come out because
4556080	4560160	if you remember correctly, uh, all the portable Silent Hill games haven't been very good. Like
4560160	4565680	you remember the PSP ones and stuff. It's just. I never really played the PSP one. I remember it
4565680	4572320	though. That was origins, right? Uh, I think, yeah, cause I'm confusing. There's that PSP one.
4572320	4579360	They ported it to PS2. Oh yeah. Okay. Um, anyways, this week, not a whole ton of stuff coming out.
4579360	4586640	It's more of like a, uh, catch up week, I guess. Um, so PlayStation three, Xbox 360, and Wii.
4587200	4592800	You've, I hope you like hunting because, uh, Cabela's African adventures, uh, will be coming
4592800	4606240	out this week. Also on, um, was it a PlayStation three as well? Uh, see here we had, I want to say
4606240	4610320	was it this guy? Yeah, this guy did too. No, actually that was last week. I'm sorry. Uh,
4610320	4618400	Cabela's are not Cabela's. So wipe out, create and crash on Wii U, 3DS, Wii, um, Xbox 360.
4619360	4625600	And of course the Xbox 360 one's a connect game. Also, what else was there this week?
4626320	4629120	Seriously? Not a lot of anything. Um,
4632080	4637680	it's not it. That can't be it. You all right. There's just not a lot of,
4637680	4641360	there's a lot of garbage coming out. Oh, here we go. You're just weeding through the garbage
4641360	4646720	right now through the garbage. Yeah. Cause, um, and last year, last few things this week,
4646720	4655120	a cradle of Egypt to, uh, for 3DS and girls fashioned shoot on 3DS. That's literally it.
4656400	4661520	Alrighty. All right. Uh, going to Japan and checking out what is coming out in Japan.
4663520	4667120	Yeah, I should, I should have called her and been like, Hey, I hate to interrupt your honeymoon and
4667120	4672000	God knows what's going on right now, but are there lines for another monster hunter? I know
4672000	4675920	I got to ask you what's on the shelves over there. We do have to get her and silent Nathan back on
4675920	4681280	the show though. Miss them. All right. Uh, coming out on October 17th, uh, on the PlayStation three
4681280	4685680	over in Japan beyond two souls is getting its release in Japan is the first print limited
4685680	4690800	edition, uh, as well as regular, uh, FIFA 14 world-class soccer and some various, uh,
4690880	4695680	additions, St. Seiya, brave soldiers and regular limited edition.
4695680	4700800	No way. They're doing a St. Seiya game? Brave soldiers. That's an old series.
4701680	4706560	So that's, uh, yeah, that's coming out on the PlayStation three, uh, coming out on the
4706560	4712880	Xbox 360 this week in Japan. Um, FIFA 14, cause you know, that game is huge and there's a like
4712880	4719920	Xbox live card kind of pack-ins to go with that. Uh, on the Vita this week, FIFA 14 is there as
4719920	4725200	well. I'm thinking the FIFA 14 is kind of a big release this week. Uh, but on the Wii U it's all
4725200	4730560	about Rayman legends, which sees this release in Japan this week on October the 17th. Uh,
4730560	4736720	lastly checking the 3DS here. Uh, actually not a lot of stuff this week, probably just cause
4736720	4741920	they're coming off the Pokemon high. There's still a lot of cases and accessories and things,
4741920	4748240	but there is one game coming out from Namco Bandai this week. And, uh, I'm going to butcher this name.
4748240	4757440	It is Sentotuchu Densetsu no Shinobi 2 Survival Battle. And all I have is a screenshot and the
4757440	4762720	little subtitle on it is battle for money. So it looks like kind of like a ninja fighting type of
4762720	4766720	game. It also says Fuji television. So what if this isn't based on some type of game show
4766720	4772480	in Japan, or maybe it's like a ninja, you know, like a ninja warrior type of,
4772480	4777280	they get all the cool shows, a ninja fighting game or a fighting show. Yeah. I just noticed
4777280	4781200	that there's a little copyright Fuji television. So it's gotta be based on some type of TV show.
4781200	4786800	So it looks kind of fun, but that's it for Japanese release dates. Uh, how about the UK
4786800	4794960	Darusaka? Uh, well, let's see, there's not a whole big pile of stuff coming out. We have on the 17th,
4794960	4801440	we have device six for, uh, IOS. We have pocket Titans also for IOS. And on the 18th,
4801520	4807760	we have alien rage. We have Skylanders swap force and Skyla, uh, actually two different
4807760	4813680	versions of a Skylanders swap force. Looks like the handheld, um, the 3DS,
4813680	4818720	Xbox three 60 Wii U Wii PlayStation three. And then they're separating their release for the
4818720	4827440	PlayStation four and the Xbox one. So that's it. Like I said, it was a little, yep. Not so small.
4827440	4831440	You know, everybody's just too busy playing Pokemon except for all of us here at OLR.
4833040	4839520	I I'll get in on that craze. I am not going to make poor Isabel make meth in the basement of
4839520	4846400	my town hall to keep my flowers pretty. I just got Lobo and I just got Peck and I got Margie.
4846400	4850560	I'm playing in my village. So you're not, you refuse to give up one addiction for another
4851680	4855600	bitch, please. But as I told you, you can't visit my town this week to get petition signatures
4855600	4860720	because my town went to Japan. My entire town got up and flew to Japan this week.
4860720	4867920	That's okay. And Lord knows how princess Irene is corrupting my villagers at this very moment.
4867920	4871360	It won't be the same. You want to know what's funny is that remember how butch
4871360	4874640	moved from my town to yours, but she's been hanging out in my shopping center.
4875200	4876480	So butch didn't want to go to Japan.
4879840	4885200	All right. It's like they're real people. Okay. A few more news stories for you guys.
4885200	4888320	Then the classic game of the week. But first, a very new game, right,
4888320	4890960	Loki? And that's the best part about it is they're not even people.
4894320	4900080	Yeah. Speaking of addictions, Grand Theft Auto five is officially broken. A bunch of records,
4900720	4907600	including the PlayStation Network record for the most downloaded title in history of the
4907600	4914800	PlayStation Network. And there's also some Guinness Book Records, which I don't know. So anyways,
4914800	4919040	let's see. Best selling action adventure video game in twenty four hours. Best selling video
4919040	4925200	game in twenty four hours. And they really narrow it down. Fastest entertainment property to gross
4925200	4929840	one billion dollars. Fastest video game to gross one billion dollars. Highest
4929840	4934160	grossing video game in twenty four hours. Highest revenue generated by an entertainment product in
4934160	4940160	twenty four hours. And the most viewed trailer for an action adventure video game. I don't know
4940160	4942960	if they really need trailer in there. I mean, that's just like.
4945200	4948560	Can they go to advertisement? Can they go too far with like, you know,
4950240	4955600	breaking down these records? I mean, this is all press release fodder. I mean, it is,
4956160	4959840	although I shouldn't belittle some of these accomplishments, because obviously Grand Theft
4959840	4965360	Auto, whether you like it or not or like it too much or not, it is a huge thing in the gaming
4965360	4971040	industry, huge. And, you know, these records do back that up that that what a practically
4971040	4975920	practically a cultural event these things are. I mean, when your video game gets parodied on
4975920	4980800	Saturday Night Live, whether that show is funny or not anymore, I mean, that is saying something.
4980800	4984080	And I don't know if you saw like the whole like angry mom sketch where she was talking
4984080	4987440	about Grand Theft Auto five on Weekend Update. But the twist was that, like,
4987440	4990160	she's not angry at the game. She's angry because she can't stop playing it.
4990160	4997840	So, you know, I actually remember way back the David Chappelle show where he did the Grand Theft
4997840	5002560	Auto parody. I do remember that switching like if your life was Grand Theft Auto.
5002560	5005280	Yeah, that was funny. That was pretty funny. I remember that. Good stuff.
5006080	5011520	Also, Grand Theft Auto Online, there's been some hiccups, but they almost have it all taken care
5011520	5016960	of and to kind of compensate players and maybe get people more interested in checking out online.
5017040	5023120	If you played any portion of the online in the month of October,
5023120	5028720	you get a half a million dollars in in-game money. Yeah, that's in-game money,
5028720	5032400	not an actual half million dollars. I wish that'd be awesome.
5033920	5039520	So some of the headlines I saw out there was GTA to give their players a half million dollars.
5039520	5043040	And then you click on the link and then the sub headline is in in-game cash.
5043440	5049440	Of course, you bastard. Click me, click me. Of course, you know, you have to play during the
5049440	5056720	month of October. You will have to also install the upcoming title update 1.04, which is going
5056720	5062720	to fix some other problems and causing vehicle purchase losses and stuff like that. And then
5062720	5068240	they're going to there's going to be two deposits of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
5068800	5074080	I'm not sure when those are going to be coming up. It's like right after each other or if it's
5074080	5079840	just, you know. Don't know how to do it, but that's cool. More money. Money's good.
5082640	5088800	Then, of course, you know, it's interesting. This sort of happened with Grand Theft Auto
5088800	5094080	San Andreas, except it wasn't necessarily that, you know, an artist was trying to sue the game
5094080	5100480	because their music was being used without their permission, but it's because they thought the
5100480	5107280	game was based off of their lifestyle. But anyways, there's an artist saying that he
5107280	5116080	wants his music taken out of the game, and that's Daz Dillinger. And he has a couple tracks in there
5116080	5122080	with, I guess, Corrupt under the group banner The Dog Pound. And so there's two tracks and
5122080	5127040	he's saying that he was offered four thousand or four thousand two hundred seventy one dollars for
5127040	5136960	his songs. But then I guess. Pass that offer up and I guess they use the music in in game,
5136960	5141840	and now he thinks that he's do more money. I think what happened is, is they tried to go to
5141840	5146000	the artist to license the track and end up going to the record label instead and licensing the
5146000	5150320	track. And now he's pissed off that he feels because they made a billion dollars that he
5150320	5153760	wants more money or something. Right. Right. Which it sounds like he needs to take up the
5153760	5157600	issue with his label, because the label's probably the one that sold the song out.
5157600	5161920	And if they paid for the studio and they paid him to make the song, they own it, whether,
5162640	5167440	you know. Unless there's something specifically in his contract about royalties. Which there could
5167440	5172400	be. Yeah. We don't know. But it's weird to me. Like, I realize that that's kind of like the
5172400	5177200	generally accepted like rationale of what Rockstar did and so forth. But what I don't get about it is
5177200	5182320	that like, why were those songs so damn important? Like, you know, when we're talking about how huge
5182320	5187600	this game is, I would think most artists would want to be in a game like this. Are those songs
5187600	5195840	like, are they necessary to the plot? No. Like the Kanye song in Saints Row 3, kind of like,
5195840	5199840	you can't do that scene without the song. It's really awesome. Exactly. You'd have to have
5199840	5204320	certain songs. But like, are those songs necessary? No, it's just on the radio. They don't really.
5204880	5209200	On the other thing too, is that he broke with those groups. Yeah. So the guy's actually not,
5209200	5214480	unless it has to be some sort of bitterness association, you know, oh, I fell out with them.
5214480	5220080	They owe me money. So there's, but I mean, there's probably tons of independent rap artists to get
5220080	5224560	featured in a Grand Theft Auto game that would like, they would pay Rockstar money to have that
5224560	5227920	opportunity. There's some good artists in there. In fact, like I started listening to some of the
5227920	5231520	other stations because I was just listening to the classic rock station and actually have been
5231520	5236560	listening to the pop station now, even though Britney's on there. And, uh, Britney Spears song
5236560	5243120	Grand Theft Auto. They have, uh, Gimme More. That is one of my favorites. I was listening to the
5243120	5248720	seventies station. That was hilarious. Um, but I was hoping they'd have Work Bitch. Cause I just,
5248720	5253520	you know, no, I saw, yeah, I saw that advertisement on YouTube the other day. I'm like,
5254400	5258560	what have you become Brittany? I mean, seriously, it's this whole reinvention of yourself. Call the
5258560	5265280	governor. Um, there is actually, there's some good songs like on Radio Mirror Park. They have,
5265280	5273600	um, it's all these independent guys, I guess. And they have a, um, a, uh, synth pop track that
5273600	5277440	actually I put in my car. And it was actually the one that was in the trailer, the latest,
5277440	5285520	the last trailer that they did for, um, yeah, for the game they had, uh, on there. And it was, uh,
5286400	5292960	sleepwalking by the chain gang of 1974. Great, great artists that I discovered through the game,
5292960	5299760	you know? And so, I don't know, that's what I like about this game. A perfect example of why
5299760	5304000	artists should be, you know, excited to be in a Grand Theft Auto game. And look, I'm not saying
5304000	5308080	that like, you know, like Rockstar has the right to just use whatever they want and artists should
5308080	5312880	just bend over and take it. But I'm just saying like, that's a good sign of like what the benefit
5312880	5317840	could be, especially for maybe an artist who isn't like AAA or what have you. Um,
5317840	5322880	and well, and this show was founded on DDR and I know I found so many artists through DDR,
5322880	5328320	especially the Ultra X Games. And if anything, if you happen to not be familiar with the slight
5328960	5334160	musical interlude that Eddie Murphy took part in, you get the wonderful track of Party All
5334160	5340320	the Time on there, which is fantastic. It's fantastic. So that's worth it right there.
5340320	5345280	I used Tim Curry's I Do The Rock last night at Rocky Horror and that was a pretty,
5345280	5350560	pretty cheesy fucking song too. But yeah, it's pretty awesome when movie celebrities
5350560	5356240	have singing careers. And some very exciting news. The guy that does the voice of Franklin,
5356240	5367680	Sean Fontenot, he is working on a project with the voice actor from San Andreas who did the voice of
5367680	5379760	CJ Young Marley. And basically this came up, I guess, at the New York Comic Con panel. And
5380640	5384480	they're asking him questions on it, but he dodged the questions and changed the subject. So
5385680	5389520	the thoughts maybe, you know, the thought at least I had from that is,
5390400	5395200	ooh, CJ's coming back to San Andreas. That's pretty exciting. Even though they said that
5395280	5399440	the whole universe that takes place before 4 doesn't really exist, I still think it's
5399440	5406400	really exciting that, you know, CJ may make a return even though he would be like, you know,
5406400	5412400	10 years older than actually, I don't know, since I think the game took place in the 90s in San
5412400	5417120	Andreas. I haven't really sat down to think about a Grand Theft Auto timeline. But yeah,
5417120	5423360	so very exciting. I hope that's some DLC coming because that would be pretty cool.
5423360	5428320	By the way, Dan showed me something in Grand Theft Auto that actually completely had me in
5428320	5432720	stitches. And that's the war vet that hangs out in front of that house by the fence,
5433600	5440000	who talks all the conspiracy theory stuff. I sat and listened to that for like 30 minutes.
5440720	5446960	It was freaking funny and sad and sad. So going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com,
5446960	5451120	there's some other chat about great celebrity crossover songs. Dungeon Buster says,
5451120	5455840	Don Johnson's heartbeat. Yes. Yeah, they totally like ripped from was it like the
5455840	5460400	one hit wonders countdown that they did on like VH1 a while back.
5461360	5465760	And then Bobby Black Wolf brought up this truly, truly classic song.
5470560	5473360	The Ballad of Bilbo Baggins by Leonard Nimoy.
5474640	5479360	This song is so fucking sad. Did you watch that commercial with him and Zachary Quinto?
5480240	5485760	Uh, I, I, that sounds familiar. I think they're in each in their own car trying to get to the,
5485760	5490960	the play golf. And while he's driving, he's singing the song.
5492160	5494800	Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Let's not forget. Shatner had a whole,
5495680	5499120	like at least two albums of him singing all of the hits.
5503040	5508320	All right. Um, I don't know how to transition from that to this, but I'm going to try anyway.
5509280	5515600	Some classic Square Enix properties, uh, going to smartphones and we start off with the news. I
5515600	5521760	mean, this is huge news. The Dragon Quest series, uh, all eight games or the first eight,
5521760	5525680	cause technically I think there's 10 of them now with the online one. Uh, there are the first
5525680	5531680	eight games going to be coming out for iOS and Android. Dragon Quest one will be out this year,
5531680	5535440	getting it all started. There's a teaser site out there saying that it will be coming out for iOS
5535520	5539680	and Android in Japan, at least in the winter. We don't know how much that will cost,
5539680	5545120	but if it's a Square Enix, you can count on a premium. Um, don't know which versions of the
5545120	5550960	game either. So, uh, yeah, there you go. Uh, a new Dragon Quest monsters game called Super Light is
5550960	5556000	also on the way to iOS and Android. Um, you know, a lot of people remember Dragon Quest here in
5556000	5561360	America. Of course we got it as Dragon Warrior, but a lot of people remember, uh, speaking of
5561360	5566160	magazines, which was kind of the theme of the show earlier. Uh, I remember the Nintendo power,
5566160	5569680	you got the Dragon Warrior guide with it, right? Or was that when you bought the game,
5569680	5573200	you got it with either the game or you got it with a magazine, probably both. I think it's
5573200	5576720	a magazine. Yeah. You got that Dragon Warrior guide. And so I know a lot of people like really
5576720	5580320	knew that game. So I think there'll be some people to kind of jump on it when it's re-released
5580320	5586240	for, um, iOS later this year. We'll see. But you know, all eight, that's pretty,
5586240	5589760	that's pretty crazy. I mean, Dragon Quest eight was a PlayStation two game.
5589760	5593200	It was really good too. It was one of my favorites in the whole series. Uh,
5593200	5597360	speaking of big Square Enix properties going to mobile, I don't know if you guys heard this,
5597360	5602640	um, Final Fantasy six confirmed it will be coming to iOS and Android this year.
5602640	5606400	And, uh, I seem to remember when Final Fantasy five came out earlier this year,
5606400	5610880	I remember thinking like, well, this is, this is testing the waters for this, uh,
5610880	5616400	Final Fantasy six will be the next big one. And sure enough here it is. So, um, they've said in
5616400	5620240	regards to Final Fantasy six, the battle systems have been altered for the other
5620240	5626560	mobile remakes and Final Fantasy and Final Fantasy six will be the same. Uh, so yeah,
5626560	5630160	I guess on the mobile devices, the battle systems have been adjusted. You won't have to do as much
5630160	5634480	grinding and fighting as much. You can just enjoy the game straight up. You won't be able to,
5634480	5638880	you won't have to do one, two step, Oh, random battle. Some, some people that's going to rub
5638880	5644320	some people the wrong way. I'm very curious to see how Sabin's moves transfer over. Like,
5644320	5648320	does that mean you're going to have to just kind of use your finger to draw the different patterns?
5648320	5651680	Cause he was the one, like you actually do quarter circle forward to have him do like
5651680	5655520	a big fireball and stuff. Remember that Final Fantasy six, like you actually did controller
5655520	5659840	movements to get him to do things where you select what it is. Yeah. I don't know. As I'm
5659840	5665360	very curious to see how some of that translates over. Um, and also, you know, there was a big
5665360	5669920	conversation on this going on on Twitter this week. You know, I talk a lot with like, you know,
5669920	5674800	spike from gamebuoy.org on Twitter throughout the week. And he's kind of not happy to hear
5674800	5680960	this news because Final Fantasy five, let's just say cut a few corners when it came to like art
5680960	5686160	assets, especially. And in my opinion, the game looks very outsourced in some places, you know,
5686160	5690880	the art assets aren't, you know, as good as they could be and so on. So there's a little bit of
5690880	5696640	concern out there that like, you know, this translation is probably not going to be very good
5696640	5700640	and it's definitely going to be just kind of a cash in. Um, I know this is one of my very
5700640	5705040	favorites in the entire series. Uh, dark soccer, what do you think about this Final Fantasy six
5705040	5712240	coming to iPhone and, uh, Android? I know you, uh, you like this game a lot. Yeah. I love the game,
5712240	5719040	but to be honest, I have the cartridge and I have the PlayStation version. So it's sort of like,
5719040	5724640	I don't need it. It's sometimes it's still fun to see your old games get remade though. I mean,
5724640	5728640	when they're good remakes, right? Like a lot of people, I haven't played it yet, but I'm hearing
5728640	5733200	Wind Waker. I'm hearing amazing things about that. You know, I'm actually getting more to the point
5733200	5739040	where the only thing that I play on my iPhone is freaking bejeweled or puzzle games. And if I'm
5739040	5744560	wanting to play a like, and this is quoting fingers, legit game, I'm going to play on my
5744560	5749280	three DS or I'm gonna play on my PC. So, well, speaking of three DS, uh, Alan alchemy in our
5749280	5754880	chat room says, I want a proper Final Fantasy five and Final Fantasy six DS or three DS remake.
5754880	5759440	God damn it. None of this iOS HD sprite crap. You know, I think that's where a lot of people
5759440	5764480	are at is because you know, the 3d remake of Final Fantasy four and three was, was pretty good. So
5764480	5773040	they, we were hoping to get the same treatment. I also, sorry, go ahead. Sorry. Okay, fine. I
5773040	5780080	use the power of my boobs to go first. Um, I agree with Agdeft, I and Honda, but I want like a full
5780080	5784720	HD version of I Honda and I want them to do a frequent sequel. Well, keep on wishing. I know,
5784720	5789680	I know, but I love that game. I would settle for like a Final Fantasy four version where they did
5789680	5794480	the after years or whatever, or Final Fantasy six. Oh, that is also coming as Final Fantasy
5794480	5798480	four. The after years is also coming to iOS and Android. That was, that was in one of those news
5798480	5804240	stories somewhere I would re I'd like Final Fantasy 60 after years or that would be really
5804240	5809280	cool to see like a, a sequel to one of the older Final Fantasy games in that way after years wasn't
5809280	5813680	terrible, but you know, I think the PSP was probably the best version of that, which so many
5813680	5820240	people never even saw it. Yeah. So, all right. Uh, let's move on. Uh, we did the classic game
5820240	5826320	of the week. I think we are. It's that time. We've just been talking about some classics like
5827120	5832400	dragon quest and final fantasy six and so forth. So dark soccer is going to dive into the gaming
5832400	5836640	vault and I think it's a non RPG she picked this week. This one may as well be for Bobby. Like you
5836640	5841840	were telling me offline earlier. Yeah. I actually asked dark soccer. I was like, were you picking
5841840	5846400	this to troll certain chatters of ours? And she's like, no. And I'm like, but you do realize dot,
5846400	5851600	dot, dot. And she's like, Oh yeah. It's like, Oh, Oh, all right. Well enough teasing. What is
5851600	5857600	the classic game of the week this week? The classic game of the week is marathon marathon
5857600	5863120	was the first person shooter done by bungee and it came out in 1994 for the Macintosh.
5863120	5866640	People who say that there's not games for the Mac. Look, there was a game,
5867200	5876160	one game. Congrats. You've got that crystal quest. I know. I know. Um, anyway, the, um,
5876160	5882640	the game was, um, bungee's second FPS game. The first was pathways into darkness. Um,
5882640	5889280	and the game basically was sort of, I wouldn't say biting on doom, but it was seen as, um,
5889280	5898800	the Mac counterpart to doom. So, um, and of course this game didn't get a, a PC version until 1995.
5898800	5904240	So marathon was very, uh, action oriented, uh, very similar to doom and how it played.
5904240	5908480	It had a multiplayer deathmatch mode. You could have up to eight players on separate machines,
5909440	5916400	um, on the same land. So it was basically like, we love you Mac players. Here you go.
5917440	5923760	And of course it also had sequels. It had marathon two and marathon infinity. Um, and then, um, in
5923760	5931040	1996 bungee completed super marathon, which was a marathon marathon two that was on the Bondi Pippin.
5931360	5935360	Um, so I'm not going to go into too much about the game itself because
5936400	5943520	the story on it is really freaking in depth. I mean, we're talking a super, super rich plot
5944480	5950880	and, you know, story twists and a lot of things that I think that sort of become a future nod to,
5950880	5957600	um, franchises like Halo, you know, where it's that sci-fi element. You're dealing with outer space.
5958160	5965680	You have, uh, AIs going on new issues with AIs and I'm not going to, uh, go too much into that.
5966720	5974000	But, um, the important thing that I think about, uh, this one is that the fact that number one,
5974560	5981040	yeah, it was on the Mac. I mean, you had very few games, I think, cause this was right when
5981040	5986000	the transition, it used to be that, you know, a lot of your, you need to have load runner and
5986000	5990560	all of your old, uh, Apple IIe games. And you had like the early Mac games, like all your Carmen
5990560	5996880	San Diego stuff and different ones. You didn't have like dedicated adult, I'd say adult themed
5996880	6002320	games. And this one I thought was supposed to be, uh, pretty, it was pretty big news at the time.
6003440	6011200	So it is in a semi 3d rendered world. Um, it's all, you know, texture mapped and dynamic lit
6011200	6016400	and everything. Um, it has an option called a free look where you can actually look around the
6016400	6022480	character and you can use your mouse to switch weapons. And, uh, it meant that you could look
6022480	6029040	down, you could, you know, move around, you could look around corners. Um, and the big thing that
6029040	6034720	it was, you know, it was level oriented. Let's kill enemies, avoid obstacles, the usual type of
6034720	6041280	FPS stuff. And then, um, to advance to your next level, you had to, uh, find a terminal that your
6041280	6048640	AI could teleport you from. So it had different objectives that you had to, um, participate in,
6048640	6054320	in the game, including your puzzles. Um, one level didn't have oxygen in it, so you had to complete
6054320	6060160	it before asphyxiating. And you had like motion sensors that you'd have to use different weapons.
6060160	6065200	Your weapons were, uh, you had to fist a pistol, assault rifle, rocket launcher, a flamethrower
6065200	6071600	that wouldn't kill everything, um, a fusion gun, and then you had, uh, this weird alien weapon.
6071600	6076000	So that's another thing that came up in Halo, you know, where you could pick up the alien's weapons.
6077440	6084240	Um, like I said, also you have a multiplayer version where it was a death match. We had up to
6084240	6091120	eight people, um, on a land game. And, uh, it was basically go around, beat each other up until one's
6091120	6097760	left. Um, Macworld gave, gave this, uh, game, um, the Game Hall of Fame award for best network game
6097760	6106480	of 1995. And, um, Bungie wanted to add more scenarios to it, but did not. They, um, were, uh,
6106480	6111920	it looks like they were trying to incorporate them into Marathon too. So, I mean, Marathon is
6111920	6119760	basically the big Mac enthusiast game. It started, I think, the realm of serious gaming on Mac.
6120640	6127040	You know, for everyone who says, yeah, Macs don't have games, this was, I think, the first attempt to
6127040	6135360	really reach out to that market. You know, it ended up being so popular that they did end up
6135360	6142480	putting it out on PC later on with a trilogy set. And they even, um, were supporting the Pippin,
6142480	6148320	like I said earlier. So, um, that, that YouTube ran out. So I'm going to switch to this, uh, from
6148320	6157280	the Xbox 360 remake here real quick. This is from Durin Dow. Well, at any rate, um, there were
6157280	6164880	concepts of the, um, AI working that were taken from Marathon that were, as I said, later incorporated
6164960	6170720	into the Halo series. And now there is also a version that came out in 2011 that is a port of
6170720	6177520	Marathon for the iPad that is, uh, it was released for free. So if you want this and you have an iPad,
6177520	6184640	you can definitely go play it. There's also, um, you can get the Aleph 1, um, engine. Um, it's at the
6184640	6192480	Marathon open source project. And, uh, there is a, a site called the Trilogy release that has, uh,
6192480	6201840	downloadable copies of Marathon and the M1A1. So you can go play it. All right. That's it then,
6201840	6207360	your classic end of the week Marathon. Whereas Bobby keeps yelling in chat, Halo Zero,
6207360	6211200	which I suppose is one way of looking at it. I mean, in a way without this, you wouldn't have
6211200	6215920	Halo. As I think a lot of the inspiration for Halo came to this. So, so Bobby, it's not necessarily
6215920	6225920	a troll on my part. It's, it's a, uh, I'd have to say a legitimate, uh, homage to your idea.
6225920	6229920	There you go. In other words, that that's, that's the, that's as much as you're gonna get.
6229920	6231680	That's as much bungee as you're getting from me.
6232640	6235280	There you go. You take what you get and you like it. All right.
6235280	6236160	You eat your peas.
6238080	6239440	All right. There it is. Your classic end of the week.
6239440	6241040	I better not catch you feeding it to the dog.
6241040	6243920	I just wanted to say though, when you were talking about like Macintosh games,
6243920	6248160	my mind does go to some stuff I was playing like way back in the black and white Macintosh days.
6248160	6253520	And, uh, I, I remember crystal quest was a huge one, which they, they did on three 60 later on
6253520	6256640	that we should do that as classic game of the week one week. Cause I love that game.
6256640	6261680	Uh, and then the other one that my good friend growing up, I had to search for this one. I
6261680	6267440	remember it. Dark castle was a great Macintosh game back in the day. If you've never checked
6267440	6271040	that out, just, just saying like, I know, I know what you're talking about is you're talking about
6271040	6276640	like, you know, a different era of Macintosh sorta, but you know, just right about when
6276640	6282240	PC really, really was picking up, you know, when the windows format, cause I think this was right
6282240	6290800	around the windows 95 era. So we're looking at the, the big jump from Mac to PC as far as, uh,
6293280	6299360	I'd say the everyday user. So Bobby black Wolf in our chat room says I approve of this classic game
6299360	6304640	of the week hearts and he is eating his piece. Good, good boy. All right. And you can have a
6304640	6310320	fudge pop when you're done. Dungeon Buster in chat, uh, says that, uh, reminds us you can play
6310320	6316080	the marathon trilogy on PCs for free. Thanks to bungee. It's at source dot bungee.org. So no
6316080	6319680	excuse for you to not check out this game of the week. And I'm going to see if it's actually still
6319680	6324640	free on iPad. Nice. All right. There you go. All right. We are definitely running long for this
6324640	6329200	first out of the show. So let's take a break guys. When we come back, we will have more orange
6329200	6333840	launch radio, rapid fire news, Google question of the week, your emails, phone calls, and plenty
6333840	6345120	more. When we come back with more of orange launch radio right after this. Welcome back everybody to

6369040	6373120	to eat, huh? Uh, you know, we give them a little bit of it, but yeah, even last year we ended up
6373120	6379520	throwing away most of it. Oh no. Well, it's just like garbage. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, anyway,
6379520	6384480	uh, so during the break here, uh, he's going to be a firework. He's going to be a firework for
6384480	6389360	Halloween. So what do you want it to be? You want it to be a fireworks. So we're like, okay.
6390320	6395920	Becky convinced Julian to dress up as captain Kirk. Oh, that's amazing. He's going to be
6395920	6399440	new Kirk or old Kirk. New Kirk. Okay. He's going to be a little heartbreaker.
6400080	6404160	That is so funny. That's going to be adorable. Julian's what? Six, seven. Yeah. Last year he
6404160	6412080	was iron man. Oh my gosh. All right. Um, one of my friends is, uh, I don't know how much about this.
6412080	6415840	I should say on air, but one of my friends is having a party and the whole theme about it is,
6415840	6421600	uh, internet memes. So I have to figure out which one I'm going to do. And I'm pretty sure I know,
6421600	6425040	but I don't want to say on air cause I know this person listens to the show and I want them to be
6425040	6428560	surprised, but uh, yeah, I'm looking, I'm so looking forward to seeing the costumes that come
6428560	6432560	out of this. It'll be fun. It's going to be a lot of fun. And the, the, the people that this,
6432560	6437680	this party will attract are all very like people that will like be really into it. Like, you know,
6437680	6443840	so I'm excited about it. All right. Um, let's see. Uh, I wanted to say during the break there,
6443840	6448800	I actually went on to Kickstarter and put my money down for that a retro magazine. So, uh,
6448800	6453440	cause if I don't do it now, I'll forget. Cause I forgot for Mighty number nine. I never ended up
6453440	6457280	contributing to that. And I forgot for something else too. I was going to download or I was going
6457280	6460720	to contribute to recently. I think it was the, I think it was the, um, well, I think it's coming
6460720	6464400	up in rapid fire news. Is it, let me, let me peek real quick. Oh yeah. It is coming up. I'll tell
6464400	6470240	you in a minute here. Uh, but yeah, uh, so I wanted to tease everybody. I wanted to remember.
6470240	6474800	So I did the donation during the break here. So, uh, I hope it gets funded so I can get some
6474800	6481840	magazines. We get times. All right. Uh, let's just, I, I, I, I want him to hire me. You should
6481840	6487520	write a letter. You never know. So, all right. Um, I saw another podcaster on the list. Act
6487520	6493760	deaf. Do you know what? I don't think Rob could be courage wolf. Rob would make a good moon moon.
6494640	6500000	What? I don't know what mem you're referencing there. You haven't seen moon moon. It's this
6500000	6506880	derpy wolf picture. No, no, it's pretty funny. Just look up moon moon. All right. I will. I will.
6506880	6513040	All right. Uh, like scumbag Steve. Funny you mentioned that because I told, I told Alan,
6513040	6516480	that's what he should be. And he really took offense to that. And I'm, but I'm like, but,
6516480	6522240	but like you're tall and like, cause I don't know half of them, half the name,
6522240	6528480	name, the names of them out there. Um, but maybe like, was it that guy that's high or whatever
6528480	6535200	that comes to the real, you know, the. Epiphany guy. I forget what the Kiana Reeves, not the
6535200	6539600	Kiana Reeves guy. There's, there's one. It's like a guy at a concert or like a rave or something
6539600	6543520	like that. And he's just kind of standing there like high looking and I don't know.
6544000	6548720	You need to go to know your mem.com and find it on there. Well, the whole website about it.
6548720	6552080	That's the problem is I don't know what it's called. So it'd be kind of hard to look it up.
6553040	6557760	Whatever. It's, it's no big deal. All right. Uh, let's move on. Uh, rapid fire news. Uh,
6557760	6561840	talk about quickly what's going on in the gaming world. Loki. So the first piece of DLC for saints
6561840	6571040	row four comes out on October 22nd, North America, October 23rd in the UK. Um, and it's the answer
6571040	6577120	to the dominatrix DLC member eight dominatrix was going to be what saints row four was originally
6577120	6582000	their plan on doing this standalone expansion for saints for the third is going to have this,
6582000	6587440	um, it's basically an alternate storyline to what saints row four is. So includes an alternate
6587440	6593440	zen invasion storyline with the saints trapped in a virtual world run by an AI program known as the
6593440	6599920	dominatrix. And they have to survive, I guess, against a bunch of sex workers and gimps and stuff
6599920	6606400	in the game. So, um, only a game like saints row. Can you be, I guess it's going to have new
6606400	6612960	weapons, enemies, allies, and they said missions and a behind the scenes commentary, taking what
6612960	6619120	I learned from saints row, the third, and to all those that have saints row four, I caution you
6620000	6624640	wait until the reviews come out before you decide to buy this DLC, especially if you decide to buy
6624640	6630000	a season pass because the season passes for two pieces of DLC. Cause if it's anything that saints
6630000	6635680	row the third, those pieces of DLC were 30 minutes long and they were crap. You played them once
6635680	6639200	there's like four missions and you're done with them and you're just like, why the fuck did I
6639200	6646160	just spend money on that? So take the time to read the reviews on the DLC before you purchase it,
6646160	6651520	because that's what I'm going to do because I've gotten screwed multiple times by saints row the
6651520	6660560	third. So just a fair warning. And yes, it will be, I think $7 for the DLC. Yeah, $7. So cool.
6662560	6666720	If you want to get an Xbox 360 and haven't done so yet, there are going to be some
6666720	6672000	holiday bundles and then they are launching to believe today. And those holiday bundles are
6672000	6676800	going to net you not only game systems, but two free games with each one. So for example,
6676880	6684800	they have a 200 for $299, a 250 gigabyte system with halo four and tomb Raider,
6684800	6688480	a four gigabyte system with connect with connect sports season two and connect vendors. Well,
6688480	6692800	that's technically one free game because connect ventures comes with connect, just saying. And
6692800	6700720	then of course also a three 99 bundle for 250 gigabyte system with connect and forza horizon,
6700720	6708960	as well as connect sports season two. And actually, you know what? I don't even know
6708960	6715120	if that's season two and looking at the picture now. I think that might be the connect sports
6715120	6724080	season. I think it's both season one and season two. Let me see here real quick. I need to get
6724080	6728720	better picture of this. That's not season two. At least that's what it says on a major Nelson site,
6728720	6733040	but it doesn't look like the boxer does not look right. I think he's full of shit.
6734000	6739280	That's just me. Anyways, so yeah, that's going to be coming out. And so look forward to those.
6740240	6748160	Also, I guess that is season two. Now that I look at the picture. All right, whatever. Also,
6749600	6755200	Ubisoft has revealed the Assassin's Creed four season pass content. And unlike this time around,
6755200	6762320	we don't get an evil Washington. Instead, we get freedom cry, a nine mission single player
6762320	6769920	campaign starting or starting a new protagonist, Edward Kenway's first mate, let's say aid whale.
6770560	6781840	And he is an escaped slave. So that's going to be coming, I guess, 1999 for the season pass.
6781840	6790800	Cool. And they have a, an exclusive crack and ship pack. So you can, do you get to
6790800	6794560	yell release the cracker? Yes, you do. You get the ring. Yes. You get the yell that, you know,
6795680	6799840	that's what it's all about. That's what it's all about. What about the whole fact that the
6799840	6804640	Assassin's Creed DLC is not coming to Wii U. What do you think about that? That was like,
6804640	6808880	I don't really think anything about it because it doesn't seem like a lot of DLC comes to
6808880	6814560	Wii U. What is up with that? Because it's like, okay, because the third money to make it three
6814560	6818560	Assassin's Creed three had DLC for it. So I don't understand why it's not coming to
6818560	6822240	and like Mass Effect didn't have it and all these other games aren't doing it. And I'm just kind of
6822240	6826320	like, the only thing I can think of is that there's some must be some sort of funky
6826320	6830800	infrastructure that they have to put in there. Maybe they have to tweak some stuff. It's just
6830800	6837040	my, the tinfoil hat guy in me. And, you know, judge me all you want, but I am convinced that
6837040	6842400	there is something in Nintendo's online infrastructure that is not conducive to the
6842400	6848400	DLC thing like Sony and Microsoft. I don't know what it is. Maybe it's the cut that they take
6848400	6854560	or something, or maybe it's like, you know, well, I would think even if the cut wasn't that good,
6854560	6858640	it's still thinking you would want to do that. Maybe it's some sort of exclusive, I don't know,
6858640	6862560	I don't know what it is, but yeah, I know a lot of games come out for the Wii U and they don't
6862560	6866320	have DLC packed in there. I don't think it's the cut or anything, or it wouldn't be so appealing
6866320	6868960	to indie developers, though. Like, I almost wonder if it's something about the process.
6868960	6871920	But indie developers don't do DLC for their games, usually.
6871920	6877520	True, true. Alright, anyhow, so the tinfoil speculation continues all around the internet.
6877520	6882320	Meanwhile, a game that's coming out for the Xbox One that some people are looking forward to,
6882320	6887920	Killer Instinct. Killer Instinct will be doing their balance updates on the fly. In other words,
6887920	6891200	they're talking about, they're talking about doing the cloud. They're talking about their updating
6891200	6894720	immediately through the cloud, and all the variables that talk about how a character
6894720	6898720	behaves are going to exist in the cloud, and this is according to producer Torin Rettig,
6898720	6903360	talking to Game Informer. Without having to content update or patch the game at all,
6903360	6907440	we can just go in on the cloud and tweak these variables without the player having to know.
6907440	6911520	Our vision is for it all to be behind the scenes, so it won't require any official title update
6911520	6915040	download. Basically, the game checks for the latest version of the gameplay's parameters
6915040	6919600	and automatically updates if it's a new version. No download or confirmation dialogue necessary,
6919600	6924080	and the files themselves are so small, you'll never notice the difference. So what I'm hearing
6924080	6929760	is that it is patching. They're just really small files, so like they're patches, but they're not
6929760	6934480	like PlayStation patches that take like an hour, you know? That's fine if they're doing that,
6934480	6938960	and they did that even with like some Xbox games got around that where they could tweak stuff.
6938960	6944720	I remember one of the games we actually talked to people or talked to a developer at E3 about was
6944720	6951040	that Madballs Babbo Invasion game, remember that? And they were talking about how they could tweak
6951040	6956480	everything via, you know, just basically having the game be online, they can tweak all the
6956480	6961840	variables. I get the idea about tweaking things like in the cloud, so to speak, like a lot of MMOs
6961840	6965680	do this all the time. We call them hot fixes in World of Warcraft and so forth, but when I hear
6965680	6970080	like, well, it's tweaked in the cloud, but then there actually are small patches, but it's done
6970080	6974960	in the cloud. I'm like, you use that word cloud, and I don't think it means what you think it means.
6974960	6978720	You don't think you know what it means. I don't think it means what you think it means. Anyway.
6978720	6983120	Just call it the internet. It's the fucking internet. It's not a cloud. It's the internet.
6983120	6993120	The internet is infrastructure. It's not the cloud because then you get people making ridiculous
6993120	6996880	like comparisons to clouds. Like, oh, it's raining. It's stormy in the cloud.
6997520	7002000	All right. Here's the other Kickstarter I teased earlier that I forgot to back and the deadline
7002000	7007920	has passed. It's River City Ransom Underground. River City Ransom Underground did make its funding
7007920	7013920	this week. They raised 180,000 Canadian dollars and that will ensure that they will be able to
7013920	7020400	get the game onto the PC. So yeah, there it goes. So congratulations to them. Look forward to being
7020400	7026320	able to play the game. And lastly, here's the game I am very excited about on the 3DS. I am
7026320	7030560	more excited about this game than Pokemon. Sorry about it, but this is far more important than
7030560	7036080	Pokemon X and Y. I don't care if you're going to judge me for that because this is Zelda,
7036080	7041040	A Link Between Worlds. I am very excited about this. There was a new trailer shown this week
7041040	7046800	that actually shows that some of the ways that you have, or you have that link between worlds,
7046800	7051440	because obviously in the teaser logo, you have like the light Triforce and the dark Triforce.
7051440	7055520	Well, in this new teaser, you see Link literally slipping through cracks. Cause you know,
7055520	7059760	it's that whole thing where he can kind of put, press himself up against a wall like paper.
7059760	7065680	And he goes from high rule to low rule is the name of the other world. It seems like, get it
7065680	7072320	high, low, ah, her anyhow, whatever, uh, as long as the game's good, I don't care what they call
7072320	7077600	the world. Uh, so there it is. And uh, I guess there is a new villain in the game too, but I
7077600	7082320	kind of go, sure. There's a new villain. Sure. It's a new villain. It'll fucking be Ganon
7083840	7088000	somehow or something controlled by Ganon or whatever. But anyhow, the release date of the
7088000	7094000	game, November 22nd, man, that makes me want to bust out my link to the past cartridge, right?
7094720	7099280	I know just because I love, I love the last battle in that game. Yeah. I just love that
7099280	7102720	ending. That's like, I haven't played through that game in a very long time.
7105120	7110720	A little bit. So anyway, uh, dark soccer, what do you have? I don't know. And we're not even
7110720	7117520	talking about that in the chat room. We're talking about, uh, Strider, whatever Strider.
7117520	7122720	Yo, it's always about other topics than what we're actually talking about on here. Strider.
7122720	7128720	Okay. So, um, the Double Fine is going to be hosting the day of the devs on November 2nd.
7129360	7135440	Um, it is with the help of I am 8-bit. It is free to the public and it's an event that will let
7135440	7141360	the public basically meet the folks at Double Fine and, um, some other indie developers and
7141360	7147120	let them check out some of the Kickstarter, uh, games like, uh, Broken Age and another
7147200	7153440	untitled, uh, game. And so it's basically just hang out with us, play some games. We're cool
7153440	7161760	people. You like us. So hurry for Double Fine. And then, um, Ed Boon, who, um, developed Injustice
7161760	7167360	and he was our Mortal Kombat dude, he basically said on Twitter that he wanted to create a Mortal
7167360	7172080	Kombat versus Street Fighter, um, and that he's reached out to Capcom to see if they would be
7172080	7176480	interested, but they have not replied yet. I don't know that that would be something that
7177600	7180800	Capcom would go for. They would do it because, I mean, if they do it, they're the same route as
7180800	7185280	they did like with Injustice, well not Injustice, but like, Mortal Kombat versus DC where it's kind
7185280	7189760	of pussified where they just, you know, make it teen rated and not so violent, then they could
7189760	7193840	probably get away with it because I think the whole thing was, well, we don't want to have,
7193840	7198480	you know, these guys doing fatalities on, you know, Street Fighter characters or even I think
7198480	7202240	DC does the same thing. We don't want, we don't want Scorpion ripping the head off of Superman
7203120	7210560	because that's just not realistic. I still thought it was funny that they put in the original Joker
7210560	7216080	fatality later on, the full thing. Yeah. That was pretty cool. So, um, and then something that a
7216080	7221840	lot of people are excited for is that the Final Fantasy X and X-2 HD remasters are going to be
7221840	7230640	out in Japan in December. They will be out for a Vita and PS3 and the date for release is December
7230640	7235520	26th. So I'm hoping that we're going to get it soon after over here in the US.
7237120	7242640	Yay. Yay. There was much rejoicing. That's the only upcoming game that I had tentative for this year
7242640	7248560	that I still don't know what the date is. I keep asking too. Yeah. I would assume it'd have to be,
7248560	7254400	assuming they're localizing it around the same time as the current development,
7254400	7262960	then I would assume sometime in January, February. Alrighty. I, yeah, I really want,
7262960	7266720	I'm really looking forward to those games, but I'm okay if it takes until after the holidays to
7266720	7271120	finish it. Cause I still didn't even play through Kingdom Hearts. Final Fantasy XIV derailed all
7271120	7276080	my gaming stuff. Like I got to get back on board with the other stuff. Rob, you still have to play
7276080	7282400	XIV with me. Make me. No, I'm just kidding. Alan can run dungeons now too. So I'm trying to get
7282400	7285360	him up to speed and then maybe we can all do stuff. I'll make you a sandwich if you play.
7285360	7289440	Cool. I love sandwiches. But not right now. Alright. Let's get to the FUGL question of the
7289440	7301600	week you guys. Every week we ask a question of our Facebook and our Google Plus communities.
7301600	7305920	You take those words and throw them together and you get FUGL. So it's time for the FUGL
7305920	7310800	question of the week. And that question is knowing the interview we had earlier tonight,
7310800	7314960	we kind of stuck with the theme here. And the question is, do you currently, or have you in
7314960	7320240	the past subscribed to any video game magazines? Which ones? Do you have a particularly favorite
7320240	7325440	issue? And, uh, yeah, so we got a lot of responses to this. I don't have time to read all these
7325440	7329120	answers. I'm very sorry. So I'm going to really encourage you to go to our Facebook community
7329120	7333600	at facebook.com slash orange launch radio and our Google Plus community to check out the answers.
7333600	7337280	I'm going to try to read some of these and I'm going to try to pick names I don't see
7337280	7341440	very often. Just, just to cycle through some different voices. I don't always see in chat
7341440	7346720	or other places. Um, so starting with gaming nerd on Facebook says I used to be a subscriber
7346720	7352400	to a number of magazines, including game pro EGM, Sega visions, game players, and game informer.
7352400	7356560	I forgot about Sega visions, but yeah, that was a cool magazine. Um, I still have all of the
7356560	7362720	issues collected in bins to take out and flip through whenever I feel a nostalgic rush. Um,
7362720	7368480	let's see. Unfolded Raptor says I subscribed to Nintendo power and electronic gaming monthly
7368480	7373360	and have kept every issue, but the story behind behind my favorite issue is interesting.
7373360	7379360	In October, 2004 issue 183 of EGM, they interviewed a girl by the name of Rachel Moore,
7379360	7383920	who is talking about horror games and wearing a Tony Hawk's underground shirt. About 2006,
7383920	7389120	I discovered orange on radio randomly and started listening to you on my PSP. This got my interest
7389200	7393200	started in gaming podcast. And eventually I wound up on all games.com, which is, you know,
7393200	7398080	where we were previously, uh, and listen to both OLR and all games interactive then moved to dead
7398080	7402320	pixel and spooky hour horror hour where Rachel Moore was a host. I didn't think much of it at
7402320	7405920	the time, and I didn't put it all together until I was looking back at my old gaming magazines and
7405920	7410080	had a holy shit moment because this girl I was listening to was way bigger than I thought. And
7410080	7415440	I knew her before, even if I didn't realize it now it's kept in a safe place. Then imagine my shock
7415440	7419920	when I heard OLR was moving to all games.com. It was amazing. And now we have VOG, but I love
7419920	7423840	how everything worked together and everything was so connected. Life can be funny sometimes.
7423840	7427920	That's very true. It's you never know where the people you might've seen in one place are going
7427920	7433280	to end up. That's just, that's just true anywhere, you know, in, in anything, any industry, not just
7433280	7440800	gaming. Um, Elliot B says I had a subscription to edge magazine for over a decade now, and it's
7440800	7444880	still very much worth reading. Always has interesting features and stunning design,
7444880	7449440	especially the gorgeous glossy covers. Though I sometimes miss the days when it was pretentious
7449440	7455040	enough to refer to itself in third person. Uh, Amanda R replies and says, I subscribed to
7455040	7459920	Nintendo power back in the day. It was really a great magazine. When Pokemon red and blue came
7459920	7465280	out in the States, they had little tear out comic book size guides in every issue, uh, were
7465280	7469520	incredibly helpful. And even before the game came out, they got us really hyped to play it. Yeah,
7469520	7474080	we brought up the dragon warrior one too. And that, you know, that final fantasy,
7474080	7477920	what else did they have? Those big strategy guides earthbound had a big one. You know,
7477920	7482720	those all really got people hyped for those games. Uh, this was before the internet was really a
7482720	7486800	thing and I'm not sure if there was a strategy guide out there. So the little guides were
7486800	7492400	gold. Uh, James A replies and says, I have subscribed to game informer and Nintendo power.
7492400	7497920	My favorite issue would have to be Nintendo power one 72 because they featured some envelope art
7497920	7504000	that I submitted. It was the happiest moment of my young life. And lastly, we'll read an answer
7504000	7509280	here from Veronica S who says, I used to subscribe to Nintendo power back in the game cube days,
7509280	7515360	but I got tired of reading it. So I unsubscribed. Now I subscribe to Nintendo force, the all new
7515360	7521440	spiritual successor to Nintendo power. Thank you guys for the answers. There were so many answers,
7521440	7525920	um, that I just, you know, we were running a little long tonight because of, uh, we had a
7525920	7530640	longer part eight and I than usual. So I don't have time to read all 20 plus responses on
7530640	7535600	Facebook and then Google. So, uh, please check out what our listeners had to say. A lot of love
7535600	7539680	for Nintendo power across the board. I noticed, which, um, you know, doesn't, doesn't surprise me
7539680	7544160	one bit. That's certainly one that's near and dear to my heart. You know, I got, I got in trouble
7544160	7547920	when I was in fourth grade over an issue of Nintendo power. Yeah. Cause I had it out in
7547920	7552560	class and I was showing friends. It was, it was the controversial issue, uh, with Simon's quest
7552560	7555920	on the cover. It was only like issue four or something, but you know, like parents were very
7555920	7561680	upset that there was like skulls and, and, and imagery on the cover of the magazine like this.
7561680	7567680	And I had one of the big guides for, um, Mario paint. Oh yeah. I remember that one. You had the,
7567680	7572960	it had the songs in it. You could put in the songs. They had a bunch of, uh, bitmap or,
7572960	7578480	you know, bitmap stuff for like all the different characters. And it was pretty cool for the record.
7578480	7584000	There was a magazine that I was super into that had a short run, but it was gorgeous in its
7584000	7589200	production value and their designers were freaking brilliant. Um, do you remember play?
7590160	7594640	Uh, I think I still see that magazine in places. Yeah. I know that. I don't know if it's,
7594640	7598800	I don't know if it's still in, well, not like new, but like collectors things, but, um,
7599520	7605920	they had gorgeous spreads. I mean, the design in that magazine was so top notch. That's really,
7605920	7611760	um, one of, uh, I've actually used examples from that magazine in some of my own layouts,
7612560	7617520	borrowed ideas from it because it was such a group and it was very well written on top of that.
7619040	7621760	Alrighty. Well, let's move on with some more news stories. Loki.
7622480	7628560	All right. Um, so let's talk a little bit about, um, a follow-up kind of what we talked about last
7628560	7634000	week with the whole Neo Geo X plug and play thing. Um, you remember we were talking that they were
7634000	7642080	basically ending their contract with Tomo and Tomo wouldn't be able to create these, um, Neo Geo X
7642080	7646640	portable systems and the dock and stuff that actually looks like the Neo Geo system and the
7646640	7651360	controller and all that. Well, Tomo denies that there was any sort of breach of contract at all.
7651360	7657440	And actually they're just going to continue selling the Neo Geo X anyways. And apparently there's
7657440	7664240	been some comments, I guess, from people that had other agreements with SNK previously saying that,
7664240	7670400	you know, they've retracted, I guess, um, or they they've tried to pull this kind of thing with
7670400	7675120	other companies with licensing, but it says they're licensed. They recently extended their
7675120	7681040	licensing agreement through, uh, 2016 and that they're going to basically keep, you know,
7681040	7687600	publishing that stuff or making those things until their contract runs up, despite what,
7687600	7693680	you know, SNK is saying, because I guess there would be a breach of contract. Um,
7694960	7697520	this is kind of interesting. And so they're saying that, you know,
7699040	7704480	basically they're still taking care of, I guess, all the warranties of, um, those systems as we're
7704480	7710000	continuing to sell Neo Geo X products, including Neo Geo X gold system, arcade sick, mega pack,
7710000	7714480	classic volumes, one through five, it says the license agreement, which allows Tomo to sell
7714480	7722640	and market these products remains in effect. So that's kind of interesting. So yeah, I like that.
7722640	7726720	They're not going out without a fight. This is pretty cool. Well, I mean, if they've got a
7726720	7730080	contract that they signed and then all of a sudden, you know, SNK saying, well, no,
7730080	7734800	we don't want to do that anymore. And unless they have like a legal out in that contract,
7735360	7740880	I don't see how they can just say, no, we're not going to off, you know, we're not going to,
7740880	7745760	you know, follow through that contract. Right. Right. I mean, come on. I don't know why they
7745760	7750160	would do that in the first place where they don't want the Neo Geo being out there. I don't know
7750160	7756480	what their plan is. All right. Guess we'll see how this plays out. Yeah. And maybe your chance
7756480	7761840	isn't up to get one of these systems after all. All right. Well, uh, anyhow, uh, dark soccer,
7761840	7766320	I know you like the Coleco vision. So I'm sure this news has you either very excited or very
7766320	7772080	scared. Um, there's going to be an iOS app that is going to, uh, invoke the Coleco vision through,
7772080	7777360	uh, you know, emulation and all that. Um, it, uh, was on Kickstarter, I guess at one point,
7777360	7782400	uh, Oh no, it is, is right now actually, uh, trying to seek. I thought that this was already
7782400	7786480	funded, but I guess not. They, they were doing this whole little countdown thing and I thought,
7786480	7790240	Oh, they're going to unveil the app. Well, I guess they unveiled the, um, Kickstarter, but,
7790240	7796080	uh, it's rant media games who did the original vet treks regeneration, which was, it's a pretty
7796080	7799360	good little app. If you played it, they're trying to get a quarter million dollars through
7799360	7804640	Kickstarter by November 8th to fund this iOS app. Uh, they're also targeting Android, PC,
7804640	7809280	Mac, and even possibly things like the Vita. I imagine that's like stretch goals or whatever.
7809280	7814160	Um, they're hoping to have a living room menu in the app and allow you to kind of swipe across the
7814160	7818720	stream to get games, check out the box art, check out the cartridge. The vet treks one is pretty
7818720	7824560	cool. If you haven't already played it, they do have the rights to 19 different games and sorry,
7824560	7828960	Casey Munchkin is not Munchkin is not one of them. Well, Casey Munchkin wasn't on the Cliccovision.
7828960	7833040	Wasn't, I thought that was the Cliccovision. That was the Magnavox Odyssey too. I don't know.
7833040	7838000	Son of a bitch. Like all the different, uh, all the games that they have lists on here.
7838000	7843520	I'm quite excited for actually now that I look at the list. Space Fury. I had an Atari 2600,
7843520	7847280	so all those other systems kind of blurred together for me. Space Fury is one of my favorite
7847280	7851520	Cliccovision games. Well, there are some pretty good ones that I even noticed here like Bump and
7851520	7856240	Jump. I remember that Jumpman and Jumpman Jr. certainly remember from the 64 Montezuma's Revenge.
7856240	7862320	Oh my God. That was a huge game. Uh, Zaxxon. What's the one you're looking at, Logie? Well,
7862320	7867920	I used to play a ton of Bump and Jump and actually a ton of Jumpman Jr. Frenzy, Space Fury and Zaxxon.
7867920	7871760	I think I've planned Pepper too. I think I've actually played most of these games except for
7871760	7875120	Antarctic adventure. I don't recognize that or destructive. There are two games that I would
7875120	7882000	want to be on that list and one of them would be Venture and the other one, um, would be, uh, Gorf.
7883280	7887760	I would, I would put money into it if they had Gorf. And I love, I love the little, like,
7887760	7891840	the boxing. They have a, you know, a bunch of different animated banners and stuff. And for
7891840	7897840	platforms, they have the, uh, Rocky IV game on there, which is awesome. They have a special
7897840	7903440	controller for it and everything. All right. So, um, they're looking for a quarter million
7903440	7908720	dollars on Kickstarter. They've got 5,000 after the first five days, which is supposed to be,
7908720	7912960	like, kind of like the biggest push. I don't know. I'm going to be just completely honest.
7912960	7917520	I think a quarter million is too much money for a project like this. And I understand they justify
7917520	7923280	it. And I, you know, I, it's not that I'm thinking like, oh, you know, they're not like, they're
7923280	7926880	asking for too much money and we don't really know where it's going. I get it. They got to get
7926880	7930800	the licensing and all this stuff. And that's where a bunch of it is, is going so that the whole
7930800	7935680	thing's legal and all that. But I just think at the end of the day, you're going to ask for a
7935680	7941600	quarter million dollars for an iOS app of a system that is so old. And I just, I don't think there's
7941600	7945520	going to be enough people that are interested. I'm sorry. Like, I know that sounds really cruel, but
7945520	7950320	especially when we were talking about a lot of retro love earlier, but that's, yeah, I don't
7950320	7953760	think they're going to hit it. If they do great, more power to them. And I would love to check out
7953760	7959680	the game when it comes out. Uh, but I don't know. It's a lot of money to try and get off Kickstarter.
7960960	7964240	What do you guys think? Do you think I'm right? Do you think I'm being cruel? I don't think that
7964240	7970720	they're going to hit it, but I wish they'd hit it if they had Gorf adventure. The, my thing though,
7970720	7976480	is seriously is how these games can, I mean, cause they have a num pad on that thing. And then
7976480	7981440	the joystick was really weird. So it'd be interesting to see how this is going to translate
7981440	7988400	over to the actual way to plane. And that's why every time I get excited about a retro game
7988400	7993520	collection on iPad, I walk away really disappointed because the touch controls just
7993520	7998960	suck. Now, ever since I got the, I cayed, that's improved things significantly. The vector X game
7998960	8003760	thing I think works pretty good. The I K right. And I K it's great with some of the other apps,
8003760	8009280	like the, uh, uh, ARCA got midway arcade or whatever it's called that's on there. Uh,
8009280	8014000	it works great, but the reality is I can't haul that thing like into bed when I'm about ready to
8014000	8017280	go to, you know, I lie down there for, you know, a few minutes before I go to bed and play something
8017280	8020800	on my iPad or something. Can't really do that with the I K and the touch controls just kind of
8020800	8025760	blow. So every time I get excited about one of these retro remakes, I actually play it. And then
8025760	8031440	I'm like, eh, I missed the real thing. So, all right. Anyhow, sorry to be Debbie downer, dark
8031440	8041040	soccer. What do you got? Uh, some stuff. Well, um, the God damn stupid iPad. I will get frustrated
8041040	8046000	by the touch controls too. You know what? I think this thing is touched in the head. So
8047680	8056320	THQ is suing EA and Zufa. Um, and what they are suing about this time is, um, is everybody's
8056320	8064000	fucking suing everybody. Um, they're suing about the, um, UFC game. Uh, basically EA was going to
8064000	8071280	be releasing the, um, EA sports UFC in 2014. And, um, because they gained the license for that in
8071280	8080240	June, 2012, which was six months before THQ did. And so, um, since basically THQ was bankrupt,
8080880	8087280	um, Zufa paid, uh, looks like, uh, 10 million for breaking the contract. Um,
8089120	8096160	and THQ says that, no, we were supposed to receive double that. So yeah, it's money. We want,
8096160	8099600	we're bankrupt. We need the money. We need to pay back our attorney fees, that type of thing. So
8099600	8106240	I think for what it was is I think that basically EA, uh, had insider information regarding THQ's
8106240	8115040	financial standing and they let the company, they let the, uh, other company know about that and
8115040	8123200	were able to negotiate a better deal because of that. And so they're off that insider information
8123200	8130320	was leaked out about, you know, THQ. It is kind of funny to see, you know, THQ suing
8131840	8138160	anybody because they've kind of dissolved anyways. Who is THQ anymore? It's kind of interesting.
8138160	8143920	One dude at a desk. I am THQ. It's more like their lawyer. I am Spartacus.
8144640	8149280	Get off my lawn and give me another $10 million. Yeah, seriously. It's whatever
8149360	8157200	lawyer now represents him. Seriously. So yeah. All right, let's move on. Loki. All right. Um,
8158320	8162480	so since we've been talking a little bit about crowdfunding, this is kind of interesting.
8163040	8170560	Square Enix has this new partnership with Indiegogo. It's called the collective.
8170560	8179680	And what it is is basically this Indiegogo curated page, um, that's going to allow people
8179680	8187680	to vote over the course of 28 days. And, um, they're on different like product, uh, project
8187680	8196880	pitches, including, um, rebooting an old franchise from Eidos. So, uh, I don't know. That sounds
8196880	8201200	interesting, I guess, but it's kind of weird though that we have to go to crowdfunding to
8201200	8208400	do that sort of thing, but whatever. Um, so basically, you know, you can pitch your ideas
8208400	8213600	to developers and if people like those ideas, they may run with it. You know, whenever I see
8213600	8218880	something like this, it's kind of like, yeah, we've run out of ideas. Why don't you guys give
8218880	8224800	us ideas and we'll make money off of them. Um, you know, and the way they pitch it, oh, well,
8224800	8230080	you can shape the development of the game and, and, you know, get these ideas out there and
8230080	8236880	we'll run with them and blah, blah, blah. And I'm assuming since it's, you know, partnered with
8236880	8242080	Indiegogo, does that mean we have to fund it too? You know, we're going to have to fund this game
8242080	8248000	that you're going to make money off of. It's a little weird. You're a big company and you, you,
8248000	8252800	you can't like, you just, you don't really have a say in it. You just, you're at the point where
8252800	8257200	like, yeah, as a big company, we're just not going to take any risks anymore. We're going to
8257200	8262640	let you take the risks for us. You know, um, that's kind of what it sounds like to me. Oh,
8262640	8266320	but so many pitches free. If you're actually interested in this whole thing,
8266320	8272160	collective.square-enix.com. So check it out. There might be some cool ideas there.
8273600	8278640	As long as they're not asking us to crowdfund all the bravest too, we'll be fine. Well, I think,
8278640	8281920	well, originally it was supposed to be Eidos games. I think, I don't think they mentioned
8282000	8286240	Square Enix stuff. Cause you know, one's like, Oh, Hey remake file. It's just a little, it's,
8286240	8291280	it's a little joke. Look, he little joke. That's all. All right. Uh, this, this has to be a joke
8291280	8295360	too, but I don't think it is. It was an interview that, uh, KJ and Afune, who we've been talking a
8295360	8300960	lot about on the show lately because of mighty number nine. Uh, he was, uh, talking about,
8300960	8306720	uh, in an interview with, uh, I guess I'm not sure where it was. Was it, was it Japanese magazine
8306720	8312000	or what? But, um, sorry, I can't properly credit this here, but, um, he was talking about, uh,
8312000	8318720	the Kickstarter success and that, uh, if, uh, Capcom were to make an offer about publishing
8318720	8323840	the game, he would go with Capcom and saying, quote, there is no reason not to publish with
8323840	8330880	Capcom. Uh, he also talked about possibly turning this into a mega man title. If Capcom possibly
8330880	8335200	wanted to go that way. Now he is more hesitant about this idea, but he didn't come out and
8335200	8340960	exactly say no to it, which the gaming media is like kind of leeching onto a bit too much, I
8340960	8346720	think. Uh, but whatever, uh, it says he and his crew really want this to be their thing. Um,
8348000	8352000	so I kind of think we're grabbing on a little too much about the quote that, you know, if,
8352000	8357520	if I want to make it a mega man game, I just, I really think that was a poor decision to even
8357520	8363040	let that thought go out there because like, seriously, like I crowdfunded all this stuff
8363120	8366960	just for this to come out and be another mega man game. I don't get me wrong. I like mega man,
8366960	8370240	but it's like, it's, it's weird. I just don't think that they could do this at this point
8370240	8375200	because how would they go about making this be a mega? I guess other than calling it mega man,
8375200	8379920	I mean, because they have to fill all these backer things as mighty number nine. It's going to be a
8379920	8383520	little weird if all of a sudden it's like, it's mega man. Like, you know, imagine if you had
8383520	8388080	crowdfunded like a racing game and all of a sudden, Hey, yeah, we're going to go ahead and
8388080	8393120	we got funding from somebody. Now it's a casino game. It's like, what? Oh, that doesn't make any
8393120	8400960	sense. Um, but I don't know. I mean, essentially maybe the joke is that it's so close to mega man,
8400960	8405360	you might as well just call it mega man, you know, and if Capcom paid them some money,
8405360	8408560	they'll just call it mega man. It'll be a mega game. Cause it's essentially mega man.
8410960	8415600	I think they're drawing straws. All right. Um, I'm going to pause recording here real
8415600	8421760	quick because unfortunately our stream is down at server room. Uh, so thank you, sir. I know.
8421760	8425840	Right. So, uh, we'll be right back here after a quick look for the podcast listeners. We'll be
8425840	8429760	right back after a quick little, uh, music note here. And, uh, we'll talk a little more
8429760	8435040	about this and some other news to register participation for this week's episode of orange
8435040	8439760	lounge radio at vog network.com. Use the passphrase expert. All right. And we're back
8439760	8443760	here at orange lounge radio. Unfortunately, some technical difficulties that were a little bit out
8443760	8448080	of our control. Uh, we'll, we'll be following up with our hosting provider this week and
8448080	8452480	figuring out why on two Sundays in a row, they have decided to reset the server or whatever
8452480	8457120	they're doing that is causing the show to drop out. And, uh, if they can't give us a good answer,
8457120	8461920	we will look into a different provider for a future broadcast. In the meantime,
8462560	8465920	let's get back where we left off. We've been talking about mighty number nine and the whole
8465920	8471600	mega man thing. And the, um, you know, the, the, the fact that it was kick-started and the only
8471600	8476080	other thing I want to get out with this is that, you know, I, I get why he says if Capcom makes
8476080	8480080	the best publishing deal, then that's the company they're going to go with. Like, that's just
8480080	8485040	business, right? I don't think they're going to be, but he would, I think, I think that was kind
8485040	8489840	of like interview bait. I think somebody baited him to say that for a headline, like, Oh,
8489840	8495280	mighty number nine is going to go through Capcom and it's going to be ironic. It probably won't.
8495280	8500080	It could, but I mean, the way Capcom has been going lately and the fact that they, you know,
8500080	8503200	kind of denied this guy, the mega man game he wants to make, do you think they're really
8503200	8507840	going to come back and make the best deal to publish it? Probably not. I think somebody else
8507840	8517200	will. And that'll be that. So, all right. Uh, anyhow, uh, let's move on to our mailbag every
8517200	8522880	week. You guys send us emails, mailbag at orange launch, radio.com. And we go through the mailbag
8522880	8529600	and try to read some of our favorite emails here. Live dark Sakura dive into that mailbag,
8529600	8533440	mailbag at orange launch, radio.com. And, uh, tell us what emails we have tonight.
8533440	8538880	We have a few. Um, I will start with the first one from the Nasty Canasta.
8540400	8544400	Hi, OLR. I'd like to give my impressions on a game that's soon to be re-released, um,
8544400	8549600	Deus Ex Human Revolution. I was sitting in my big ass PC backlog for nearly, no,
8549600	8553760	this was sitting in my big ass PC backlog for nearly two years when I finally got around to
8553760	8559280	playing it. I snuck a solid hundred hours into it within the span of a month. Um, this is going
8559280	8564160	into the story. I'm gonna skip forward because I don't want to spoil it for anyone who might play
8564160	8569440	it. So, a game with an engaging plot needs some kickass gameplay to back it up and Deus Ex delivers
8569440	8574960	for the most part. This, um, in this first person RPG you can be gung-ho by making use of the guns
8574960	8579600	to blast the shit out of people. Take a more merciful route by knocking out enemies, sneaking
8579600	8585040	and hacking your way through areas or a combination of all three. It is up to you to play however you
8585040	8588960	want, though you'll be making progressively harder choices as you get closer to the end.
8588960	8592560	For the record, I watched, um, Becky's husband play through a little bit of this. It was really
8592560	8599040	good. Now, I say the game delivers for the most part because there are some significant flaws.
8599040	8603040	First, the game's occasionally buggy with handling ragdolls, especially when they clip and get stuck
8603040	8608400	in floors. Icky. Second, while the game rewards XP for various actions you do, you are awarded the
8608400	8613680	most points for playing pacifist with stealth. Although you can play however you want, the XP
8613760	8619040	rewards are pretty much big neon signs saying, want this augmentation? Do melee takedowns, bro!
8619840	8623840	Even though one of the game's achievements requires to not kill anyone in your entire
8623840	8629040	playthrough. Finally, the boss fights stand out like a sore thumb. They force the player into
8629040	8634480	lethal combat, which puts pacifist players at a major disadvantage given their play style and the
8634480	8639440	items they'll be carrying in their inventory. Despite these problems, I highly encourage
8639440	8643600	everyone to try it out, especially if you have a PC or got the game through PlayStation Plus.
8644400	8648960	The re-release fixes boss fights for pacifist players. I need to get back to the screen.
8653680	8658960	Has touchscreen players for all platforms, Wii U, GamePad, Smart Glass, PS3, Vita, CrossControl,
8658960	8664960	and TBA for PC, and bundles of DLC content. And before I forget, the game looks absolutely
8664960	8668480	gorgeous and the soundtrack is fantastic. And that comes from the Nasty Canasta.
8669840	8674400	I've heard many, many good things about that game. Speaking of which, it will be coming out again.
8674400	8680160	They're doing a director's cut that's coming out in the 22nd North America and for the first time
8680160	8685920	on the Wii U as well. So that'll be on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 for about 30 bucks. And Wii U,
8686720	8690080	which this is a great selling point, the Wii U version is actually $20 more.
8690640	8700320	So next email. Yes.
8701040	8706240	Hey guys, Monty Boggs here. Just thought I would email in and share my thoughts on the 2DS.
8706240	8711120	I bought one last afternoon along with Pokemon Y naturally, and I am completely surprised by
8711120	8715120	how much I enjoyed this handheld system. I was negative on the system at the original
8715120	8719280	announcement, but with the low price, I thought I would give it a shot. It fits pretty good in
8719280	8723680	my bigger, it should be pretty well in my bigger hands. It's a minimalist design.
8724560	8728320	It's minimalist design features and price are all I'm looking for in a system to play on the
8728320	8734960	couch at home or throw my laptop back on the go. I think anyone wanting to get access to the 3DS
8734960	8739920	library and doesn't care about 3D should at least consider a 2DS as I personally think it is the
8739920	8746640	best feeling portable in some time. Also the $70 cheaper price more than makes up for the smaller
8746640	8752640	screen than the XL. On a side note, I'm already six hours into Pokemon and I'm not the type of
8752640	8756960	gamer that typically plays that much at a time. I haven't played a Pokemon game since the GBA,
8756960	8762080	so I'm not exactly the typical Pokemon fanatic either. So while lots of people are talking
8762080	8768640	next gen, I'm going to be perfectly happy with my new Wii U and 2DS combo for the foreseeable future.
8768640	8772480	I can't wait for Super Mario 3D World and the new Legend of Zelda for 3DS.
8772480	8774320	Love the show. Take care. Monty Boggs.
8776560	8779840	I'm glad that you're enjoying it. It sounds like he is quite enjoy.
8780640	8781840	Quite enjoy. Quite enjoy.
8782560	8785680	All right, we have two emails left. One of them is long. Kinda long.
8787280	8792000	Hello, OLR gang. This is my first time giving my voice to the show,
8792000	8796720	being on the East Coast and having to be up Monday at 5 30 AM. I'm not able to listen to
8796720	8801440	your show live. I do, however, listen to every episode while I'm at work every Monday morning.
8801440	8802800	Well, I'm glad you do. Thank you.
8804160	8809120	I am a 34 year old gamer who started gaming fairly late compared to you guys. My first
8809120	8814080	console was the original NES. And let me go back to the stupid chat room before it logs out.
8814720	8819440	Okay. My parents were not a fan of me spending time on gaming and not interacting with people,
8819440	8823760	so I never got another console until I was older and able to purchase my own.
8823760	8830240	So to make a life story short, I've only played NES, PS2, original Wii and Xbox 360.
8830240	8834880	I do, however, find that I'm mostly a PC gamer. I started in PC gaming, I guess you could say,
8835920	8844800	on my appearance of 486 DX 66 and Commander Keen, although I didn't really get into gaming until my
8844800	8850400	first MMO, Dark Ages of Camelot. I was so addicted to that game, I would play until 2 or 3 AM and
8850400	8854880	then wake up at 6 30 the next morning for school. Those were the days when I would do that and not
8854880	8861920	feel like crap the next morning. Since DAOC, I have jumped around from MMO to MMO. I've played
8861920	8865680	WoW, Star Wars Galaxy, Star Wars The Old Republic, Champions Online, Guild Wars 2, Neverwinter,
8865680	8870320	just to name a few. I'm sure there are more that I'm forgetting about. Currently I decided to see
8870320	8874640	what all the hype about Mass Effect was all about, so I purchased the trilogy during the summer
8874640	8878640	months when it was on sale. I've played through all of Mass Effect 1 and 2 and I'm currently
8878640	8882640	working on 3. I do have to say I've enjoyed the storyline, but there are some things that annoy
8882640	8886960	me about the games like in Mass Effect 2 and Mass Effect 3, not being able to open the journal
8886960	8891520	without hitting escape and then clicking the journal menu item. Why couldn't they make a key
8891520	8894880	bind for the stuff like that? By the way, I think that some of the menu differences in that were
8894880	8899760	just with the differences of the Unreal Engine. I do believe, because you'll notice also their
8899760	8902400	texture rendering was different. A lot of the menu systems are different.
8904800	8911600	Also, I think if you are playing on PC, you can create a bind to load your journal, but you have
8911600	8921360	to mod your coalesced INI to put that in there. If you go to my tumblr, masseffecting.tumblr.com,
8921360	8926880	I will see if I can find the answer to that and show you how to make the key bind. I even share
8926880	8933040	my own coalesced INI with you. Just saying, because I am totally into modding my games.
8935120	8939120	Anyways, enough about Mass Effect, enough about me. I thought I was about to say Mass Effect,
8939120	8943600	but it's actually me. My question for you guys to ponder, with Valve's latest announcements about
8943600	8948880	the Steam Machine and SteamOS, do you think this could have game makers to start considering PC
8948880	8955440	gaming as a viable competitor in the console war? With a 5 year old daughter, I have had to focus
8955440	8960400	my gaming on PC. With a second child on the way in June, I've had to put my plans to purchase the
8960400	8968400	next gen in the new year on the back burner. By the way, congratulations. Indeed. I do, however,
8968400	8975360	have a fairly powerful i5 dual core with 60GB of RAM PC that I thought could handle most of the
8975360	8979760	games that will be coming out. I'm hoping my thoughts on the Steam Machines and SteamOS
8979760	8984560	bringing PC gaming into direct competition with consoles is true, so more games will come out for
8984560	8990960	PC, and the ones that do come out will come out around the same times as console, unlike GTA 5.
8994480	9001120	I think it's still too early to call that. I think that right now PC is going to continue to be
9001120	9008240	treated the same way, but if whatever the Steam Box ends up being does give more accessibility
9008960	9013440	to those PC games, then they might think about it. But right now, I can tell you just about
9013440	9017760	anything, when you have a business market, people are slow to try something new. Unless they are
9017760	9024800	desperate. Just saying. Sorry, can you summarize for me, because I was firing off an angry email
9024800	9031280	to our service provider about what's going on. If you think the oncoming Steam Box and SteamOS
9031280	9039120	will cause PC gaming to be more of a competitor to the console market. Nah. I don't think so.
9039280	9045360	I think it's so early to say, because the price is a huge motivator in that regard.
9048400	9054240	I don't know. The Steam Machine is trying to take things closer to a dedicated game processor
9054240	9060320	and device, but it's not really one. It's more dedicated than maybe a Windows machine is, but
9060320	9067120	it's not solely dedicated like a Playstation or an Xbox is. So I'm not sure that certain things that
9067120	9070960	you do on a gaming console will necessarily be possible on one of these devices. I don't know.
9070960	9075920	I sort of just think there's still room for the consoles. I think there's some potential there,
9075920	9080000	but what my point was is that a lot of times when you're dealing with the consumer market,
9080560	9086880	people are slow to switch up what works. They don't want to make the big risk unless they're
9086880	9093120	completely desperate. Anyway, thanks for the great shows. I love listening to the many shows on VOG,
9093120	9098880	including Bobby Show, OLR, and Hoard House. The shows help to make my work week a lot more
9098880	9103760	interesting. And have a great one, Cyber Judge. Thank you for emailing us. Thank you. It's always,
9103760	9106880	um, I like hearing from the veterans and the people that talk to us frequently,
9106880	9110640	but I like hearing from new people too. I really like hearing from new people.
9111920	9118960	Although I love all of you guys. Hey guys! Hey! So I've been trying to get into gaming,
9118960	9124640	but even though I have a dual box Mac Pro, Macbook Pro, I still wonder what game I should
9124640	9130400	play since I am, like, broke as a joke. I mean, I know Final Fantasy XIV is out, but I cannot afford
9130400	9135440	it. I enjoyed it during the open beta, but a connection etc issue kept me from really enjoying
9135440	9139840	it. I wish I could afford it while I'm looking for a job, but it's going to be a little hard for me
9139840	9146720	too. What do you guys think that it's, do you guys think that it's one of those games that will last
9146720	9151360	for a while, like Eleven did? Is there any Mac or PC games you think I should try in your opinion?
9151360	9156000	That's free. Thank you for answering me. If so, you're a listener of many years uni.
9157680	9162400	Um, well, if your computer is solid enough to run Final Fantasy XIV at all during the beta,
9162400	9166160	then there's a lot of free to play stuff out there that you can check out. And some of those are,
9166160	9170080	you know, MMO type things. I mean, you've got Star Wars, the older, well, I don't know how many of
9170080	9175440	these are on Mac. That's the problem. Ragnarok Online, I think, might, or Ragnarok 2 anyway.
9176080	9184240	But I used to play the old school Ragnarok Online through free servers on a Mac using an emulator.
9185440	9189120	I have to admit, I don't know which of these are playable on Mac, but I will tell you Star Wars,
9189120	9196160	The Old Republic, Rift, both free, both very solid MMOs to check out. I would highly recommend
9196160	9200320	getting Steam and checking out the free to play game section on there because there's an awful
9200320	9206160	lot in there. Uh, more MMOs, even things like Star Trek Online, uh, Marvel Heroes is a pretty
9206160	9210160	fun to play one. If you like Diablo at all, and you like your comic book people, that's free to
9210160	9214720	play as well. Um, even things that are like up a totally different alley, like Spiral Knights,
9214720	9219920	Sega is there, you know, there's, there's more and more free to play stuff on Steam that's worth
9219920	9224880	checking out and Steam's gonna make it very clear what's on Mac and what's not. And you can also,
9224880	9228640	if it's still going on the Not On Steam sale, because I do believe there were some Mac titles
9228640	9234000	included in that. Right. They weren't free, but they're low, low, low cost. Yeah. Pretty cheap.
9234000	9238720	Yeah. Don't be afraid to play stuff that's maybe under the radar because there's some great indie
9238720	9242480	games and things that, you know, not, maybe not everybody's necessarily into right at this moment
9242480	9247840	that are still worth checking out. I also do suggest installing, what is it called for, um,
9248640	9254240	not Flash, but it's a game engine that runs through, um, browsers that, uh, the Disney games,
9254240	9258800	like the Wreck-It Ralph games used. Yuni's actually in our chat right now saying that
9258800	9262960	she has dual boxed Windows 7 and Mac Mountain Lion. Oh, well then you're good for a lot of
9262960	9266960	these games you're talking. If you want MMOs, I would say check out the Old Republic if you
9266960	9271600	even remotely like BioWare games or Star Wars. And I don't think you necessarily even have to
9271600	9275120	like Star Wars to enjoy the Old Republic. I still think it's pretty good game on its own.
9275120	9280240	And Rift for sure. If you liked Warcraft and that you'd probably like Rift. And someone might gift
9280240	9287120	you Mass Effect when it goes for sale again. Someone. Somebody super nice. Yeah. There's
9287120	9290320	some really nice persons sitting at this table right now. Uh, Dungeon Buster in our chat room
9290320	9294800	at live.fognetwork.com says Neverwinter is a pretty decent free to play Dungeons & Dragons MMO.
9294800	9298480	Yes, I've heard of that one too. It's Unity. That's, that's what I thought it was, but I
9298480	9304480	didn't quite want to call it. I'd be wrong. So is that it for emails? Yup. There you go.
9304480	9308240	Mailbag at orangelauntrader.com if you have a question for a future week.
9308960	9313360	All right. Uh, let's do the FUs of the week folks. Cause we're mad.
9330720	9335040	FU to my stepdad. And to put this in the most general of terms.
9335040	9342000	Just because somebody else doesn't believe something that you, that you do, or doesn't
9342000	9346960	agree with you does not mean that they're closed minded. For all you know, they could have done
9346960	9353680	their research and found that it's not for them. Using inflammatory statements to try to guilt
9353680	9359120	trip somebody into changing their opinion or into evoking an emotional response that makes
9359120	9364320	you look like you're staying calm is no way to have a discussion. It's immature and it is beneath
9364320	9369920	you and I am done. What you showed me was pretty tacky. That's really the best word I can think
9369920	9377760	of for it. Tacky. Loki. Uh, FU to
9380240	9385680	Grand Theft Auto 5. Cause that's all I'm playing. I don't know. It's become your life. FU to the
9385680	9392080	fact that I don't have a voice today. FU to stress, making me sick when I eat and FU to
9392080	9396400	the fact that our show cut out while we're trying to do it. I hate that. Especially when
9396400	9402400	it's out of our control. Rawr. Definitely a suitable FU of the week. All right. A couple
9402400	9405680	more stories for you guys. Then we'll open up the Skypline for a little bit and try to do some
9405680	9409280	Twitter topics as well too. I'm going to, I'm going to warn you guys with this. If you want
9409280	9413280	to get in on the Skypline tonight, you need to call like as soon as we open it up. Cause I can't,
9413280	9416240	we're not going to be able to sit around tonight and wait for seven minutes going,
9416240	9420480	is somebody going to call? Somebody going to call? So either you want to participate or you
9420480	9425280	don't tonight. Rawr. You have a 10 second window. All right. You better be on it. But after two
9425280	9431840	stories. So Loki, you first. So despite some sort of a delay in the whole purchasing process,
9431840	9438240	thanks to the Delaware Supreme Court, um, the ruling has, um, made, made in favor of
9438240	9444640	Activision and yes, they will be allowed to buy the, um, I guess $8.2 billion of their own shares
9444640	9454000	from Vivendi. Um, and just a few days here on October 15th. So they will once they will become
9454000	9459200	their own company again, I guess, or more of their own company. So I remember hearing about this
9459200	9464720	before a little bit. So the news here is that it's been approved basically. So, because there was
9464720	9469280	concern, was it wasn't, it was a shareholder. It was one of the shareholders that was
9469280	9475120	seeing that they were doing this to somehow, I don't know, somehow screw them out of money
9475120	9480880	or something. I don't know how it was. Um, but yeah, it basically got over overturned, so
9482080	9487520	they can do it. All right. Uh, well, you know what? All the changes I've seen in World of
9487520	9492160	Warcraft ever since this split have been for the better. So, and Diablo three, hello,
9492160	9495600	auction house going away. That's great news. That's going to bring a whole group of new people into
9495600	9501760	the game. So we'll see. Meanwhile, Hey, we, you owners, I know you have been waiting for
9501760	9507040	that killer game that will finally just make this thing fucking fly off of shelves. And, uh, you
9507040	9511600	know, it might be, it might be, you know, Mario 3d world two or whatever it could be. It could be
9511600	9516560	a Mario Kart eight or what have you, but you know what I think it's going to be. I think that killer
9516560	9523680	must have app for the Wii U is going to be Hello Kitty cruisers, which is coming to the Wii U this
9523680	9528800	year beating Mario Kart eight to the party. And, uh, that's Hello Kitty cruisers by the way,
9528800	9534400	with a K and all I know is from this screenshot, you can play as bad bats Maru. I mean,
9534400	9539760	do you, do you fucking need anything else in a Hello Kitty game? Well, you can totally get a
9539760	9545040	jacked version of rainbow road from the Mario Kart games with little Hello Kitty space planets.
9545040	9548720	I don't know what else to call these things from the back room. I wonder if you can play
9548720	9553920	as little twin stars. Who knows anything's possible. Um, so there are some screenshots
9553920	9557760	available and, uh, yeah, you can check that out, uh, coming later this year. I don't know how much
9557760	9563200	and I don't know exactly what day, but, uh, it's Hello Kitty. Oh, it's November 5th. And how much?
9563200	9568400	I think it's $40. If I remember correctly, the countdown is on and it's a slight budget title.
9568960	9575120	It's not a $60 game. It's $40. It's, uh, yeah, it's this company in Burgos or Burgosala lightweight
9575200	9580880	or something like that. And they, uh, mainly just do Hello Kitty games. They just released
9580880	9588320	one actually on the 3DS last week or week before last. I am excited as hell. What can I say?
9588960	9595040	So yeah, it's, um, I don't know. And I did mention it back in June, by the way,
9595040	9601280	remember on, on Twitter, I'd mentioned there was a game of show and I forgot. I forgot. You know
9601280	9606000	what, if I'm not seeing news on it every five seconds, it tends to, uh, go away from my memory,
9606000	9610560	you know, as, as, as a lot of people and as a lot of folks in gaming culture, we tend to forget
9610560	9615440	these things, right? Yes. Remember, remember when, uh, Sony went down for an entire day and,
9615440	9618560	and everybody said, I'll never buy another Sony product again. And then they unveiled
9618560	9624160	the PlayStation four and everybody was like, Oh, nevermind. I'm just kidding. Yeah. Yeah.
9624160	9627440	Sony went down for a long time. Remember that. Remember when they had a problem with their clocks
9627440	9633280	and it comes? All right. Anyhow, uh, let's do it. Let's get to some phone calls. One eight seven
9633280	9637600	seven game OLR or a username on Skype is orange lounge radio, but we already have a call coming
9637600	9641920	in. So let's get to it. Hi, you're on orange launch radio. Who's this? Yo guys, it's Zina
9641920	9646080	core from OKC. How you doing? Hey Zina core. Good to hear from you as always. How are you? We're
9646080	9651200	good. It's good to know. I know about the right time for the delay in the radio to pick up. So
9651200	9655680	you've got this down to a science. You beat Rama tonight. That's something. Oh, cool. I'll put,
9655680	9659280	I'll put that on my list. All right. Give yourself a gold star. All right. What's up?
9659280	9665440	What's in your mind, buddy? Uh, the, uh, the web game for the fan made attack on Titan game. That
9665440	9671200	thing is actually pretty damn polished. I was surprised. Hmm. What is it? Have you guys not
9671200	9674960	seen it yet? No, I haven't. Tell us a little more about this. I haven't been into the anime at all.
9674960	9681120	So I've been pretty much ignoring it on Tumblr. Now that some guy used the unity engine to make
9681200	9688800	a fan, uh, inspired version of defending humanity against the Titans and it's pretty damn good. It
9688800	9693920	plays really well. It almost feels like Spiderman as far as the swinging mechanic is down. It's
9693920	9697760	really intuitive after a couple of matches and it's just as deadly as the real game is. So
9698560	9704080	yeah, I highly encourage everybody to play it. There you go. How much is that? Is that a free
9704080	9708320	one? Oh yeah, it's free. It's got just making it and threw it up on the interwebs just because
9708320	9712640	he loves the, uh, loves the game. I just threw the link up there in chat if anybody wants to
9712640	9717440	check it out. Nice. It's fangly.com slash game slash AOG. So, well, there's something for the
9717440	9720560	email or a little bit ago who is looking for some free games to play. There you go.
9721120	9725680	Yeah, there you go. What else have you been playing lately? Uh, that and some war thunder
9725680	9733280	online just to get my, uh, air to air combat jeans taken care of. Yeah, that's done, that's
9733280	9736560	done pretty well. They're getting ready to release the tanks too. Apparently they're trying to do
9736560	9743200	both land, sea and air battles all in one, a massive arena game, uh, all of world war two.
9743200	9748320	So it's quite extensive. It's really good. Uh, you fan pretty regularly these, uh, air fighting
9748320	9752480	games, like Ace Combat stuff? Every once in a while. I mean, they just now started popping up
9752480	9756560	in the, I guess since League of Legends took over, everybody's doing their own version of
9756560	9761920	massive online battle arena. Oh, I didn't even realize they kind of did that in, uh,
9761920	9768320	like airplane form. Yeah. I mean, you just spawn in everybody, depending on what army you're with,
9768320	9771760	you pick a side, you fight it out and sooner or later somebody wins the battle and that's it.
9771760	9775280	That's kind of cool. Gosh, I don't remember the last time I like seriously played like a
9775280	9780720	airplane combat game like that. It was probably top gun on the NES. And, uh, you go into that
9780720	9787200	intense rage when you can't refuel your damn plane. Oh yeah, most definitely. And, uh, since
9787200	9790960	this one's free on steam, it's bound to be picking up tons of people, especially with this next
9790960	9795360	experience when they add tanks, they just teased it over in, uh, in one of the Russian cons. So
9795360	9801120	it looked quite good. I'm all about free steam is really developing a nice little free library on
9801120	9805440	there. It's pretty cool. So that's going to be the neat thing when they get that steam machine
9805440	9808880	out there, it's going to be huge marketing thing for them is that, Hey, all you have to do is buy
9808880	9814160	the system and you can get all these games for free because they're all free. So it's a great
9814160	9819040	way to market stuff. So, yeah. So that's what I've been up to, man. Y'all take it easy. Excellent
9819360	9824800	All right. It's awesome to hear from you as always take care. All right. Bye. I like hearing
9824800	9828880	fans of games, especially when they're free, come on the show and then plug them like, Hey,
9828880	9832240	is this off your radar? Cause maybe it should like be on your radar if it's something you're
9832240	9836480	interested in. So appreciate that. Let's open up the phone one more time. You can call us at
9836480	9842640	1 8 7 7 game O L R or you can contact us on Skype, orange lounge radio, all one word. Uh,
9842640	9846320	while we wait for another call to come in, I've got a couple tweets to read about. Oh no,
9846320	9850720	they're there. Phone lines already lighten up near mine, but I will get to tweets and last
9850720	9855200	minute stories here in a minute. First, let me go to the phones. Hi on orange on radio. Who's this?
9855200	9860720	Hey, it's Ron. Hey buddy. You got beat tonight. Well, that's because I'm still dealing with stuff
9860720	9866560	from New York comic con. So excuses, excuses. All right. Well, tell us about the con already. How
9866560	9873520	was it? It was pretty good. I have to admit for a Saturday, it wasn't as crowded as I thought it
9873520	9880160	was really. Yeah. Is that because everybody was so pissed off that their Twitters were tweeting
9880160	9885200	things that they weren't intending on saying about the show. I just, I heard about this. No,
9885200	9891840	I want you to know that when you register your badge, you can opt out of that. And we all know
9891840	9897600	not everybody reads the fine print. You fill out the form, you spin down to the end that you
9897600	9902240	accept and you acknowledge, add this, add that done. Did you guys hear about this? What happened?
9902320	9906240	Like, yeah, the people that were registering and, and for whatever, for New York comic con,
9906240	9909840	I don't know why, but they were tying their Twitter accounts or something to the registration.
9909840	9914480	And like when they, when the smartphones picked up that these guys were at the convention,
9914480	9918800	it would automatically tweet, I'm having a great time in New York comic con. And people were like,
9918800	9923600	pissed that this thing was tweeting for stupid. They shut it down and like,
9923600	9930160	they shut it down in like 12 hours. That's that intrusive advertising we were talking about
9930160	9937440	earlier. Not smart. So anyway, sorry. Now that we got the little dark cloud around comic con out
9937440	9940800	of the way, tell us more about the good stuff. Not to mention the other dark cloud around comic con.
9941440	9944320	Oh, I didn't hear about other stuff. Was there more shenanigans I didn't hear about?
9947280	9952400	Listen, listen to my podcast. We're going to talk about that in depth because I have a personal
9952400	9957680	interest in that. Oh my. All right. I guess I've missed the news. Being busy with my show
9957680	9960640	yesterday probably made me miss that. If you read my Tumblr, you would have seen it.
9960640	9966880	Well, I have not read your Tumblr, Jamie, because I've been busy. But anyway, sorry if your Tumblr
9966880	9973200	isn't the first place I go on the internet for all the news, DarkSakura. All right. But for real,
9973200	9976080	tell us, tell us some good news out of New York comic con for heaven's sake.
9978320	9984000	Um, the re-release of Ron Mo and F on Blu-ray. Oh, that sounds nice. Yes.
9984160	9991120	Um, I was asked to be a part of, um, a retrospective that Viz is putting out and
9991120	9996960	we got to see some screenshots between a DVD and a Blu-ray. It looks beautiful. And,
9997920	10008240	and for Ookchan's sake, they're re-subbing the episodes. Ooh, happy. Yes. Yes. I hope they're
10008240	10013520	more accurate. Yes. You're going to shed a tear when you watch this. Yay. I need this then. This
10013600	10017760	has to be a part of my life. So were they actually showing this at comic con, the new Blu-ray?
10018560	10023680	They, yeah, they actually showed it on, I think Thursday or Friday, because I only had a one day
10023680	10028480	badge and I was talking about how much they saw it and I'm like, I hate you guys. Nice. And you
10028480	10033600	know, your name is DJ Rama S. So you, you have a slight passing interest in, in things related to
10033600	10041200	this series, right? Yeah, pretty much. I was, I think one of the reasons why it wasn't as crowded
10041200	10046240	Saturday is because in order for you to get into the con, you had to cut through the, you had to
10046240	10051520	check in. The check-in areas were outside in the parking lot areas in front of the convention
10051520	10057120	center. Cause when I walked in, when I walked in, they had, they finally incorporated the
10057120	10063920	Q room type setup for everybody to go into. And from that, it just kind of flowed like water.
10063920	10072720	What is the secret to not getting a backed up as hell line at your convention? You've
10072720	10078720	been to enough conventions. I think that would be it, the Q line, because when it comes to cons,
10078720	10085200	people will say, they will stay on the site, pre-regs at this time, people will show up
10085840	10093360	one to two hours prior just to get their badge, especially for Otakon. Because during the summer
10093360	10099360	in Baltimore, the temperature tends to hit triple digits. And I have seen people out there for three
10099360	10104800	and four hours at a time and pretty much in full costumes. It's the same way at AX.
10106080	10110080	That's why there's actually this, why this sort of thing started for a little bit of
10110080	10117600	your registration line costume. No, for real, it's a variation of a costume or a character
10117600	10121840	that you're doing that is more comfortable to wear in line, but still is, you know,
10122480	10128720	acceptable to wear out in the triple digits. Yeah, pretty much. Between you and me, I'd rather
10128720	10134320	get to the hotel, relax for a few hours, then head on over, pick up my badge and then go meet
10134320	10138800	up with friends to eat. I'd rather do that. I like when AX started doing day before pre-reg
10139760	10143200	to pick, where you could pick up your badges the day before the convention
10144400	10148640	for everyone who pre-registered, registered so that the lines were left for regular registration.
10148640	10154480	Yeah, well, but what things was happening now is even if you pre-reg and you pick up the day
10154480	10159760	before, you think that would help? No, you still have people who show up the day of and usually
10159760	10164640	out there at five o'clock in the morning just to get a badge. Meanwhile, doors don't open till
10164640	10169280	nine. Word of advice, don't wear combat boots that are not adjusted to your feet
10171040	10173840	in line for registration or masquerade. Just saying.
10174640	10178720	There is a meme I wrote about that I have to post on your wall. You'll appreciate it.
10179360	10184480	Just remind me to tell you sometime about the days of my Jill Valentine costume.
10185520	10188080	Will do. Playing DDR in combat boots is not fun.
10188640	10193120	Sorry. I beat that dress as Ranma. Those sandals, I will never do it again.
10194080	10198960	Sorry, I got really quiet there, but I took a moment to go visit the news source that I should
10198960	10203120	have been watching this whole time, Jamie's Tumblr, to read about what happened in New York
10203120	10211360	Comic-Con. My eyes just rolled so far in the back of my head, I can see my brain. I'm infuriated by
10211360	10219040	it. It's just like, I can't. I can't. That's all I can say. I can't believe. I still see how people
10219040	10223520	can think that doing something like that is okay. Here's the thing is that somebody in a room
10224240	10229520	said, and just if you guys don't know, this cosplayer, again, I'm totally reeling.
10229520	10231280	We're gonna leave the bulk of the story for Ranma.
10231280	10238880	Yes, we will. This cosplayer that was at the convention was basically sexually harassed
10238880	10244080	by this television crew that was trying to film her boobs and things like this. Just really stupid
10244080	10249600	shit. But the thing that gets me is that I'm like, somebody sat in a room and said, this is a good
10249600	10253360	idea. And for the record, this is why we still need feminism.
10253520	10256880	This is why we need common sense.
10258080	10262880	And Rob, multiple reports came up about that group right after this popped up.
10264560	10267760	And now they're playing chicken saying, well, we're not ever going to go back again.
10267760	10268960	They shouldn't exist.
10270480	10276800	That's a little, all right. I will keep my mouth shut and let you have the say,
10276800	10278240	Tuesday's on my jam session.
10278240	10282960	I would love to rant if I didn't have school on Tuesday. I would love to call in and rant.
10283040	10284960	You might need to do a pre-taped segment or something.
10285520	10288640	You are more than welcome to write up an article for my site if you'd like.
10289600	10290000	We'll see.
10290560	10291060	All right.
10292320	10296560	But let's get back on track here and I'll make this part brief and I'll get out of here.
10296560	10301840	Because one thing I have noticed on Saturday, outside of Nintendo,
10302640	10305120	no one really cared about gaming at Comic-Con.
10306880	10311680	How so? Like people just weren't lining up for it or news wasn't really coming out about it or?
10311680	10313360	Nobody was really lining up.
10313360	10319040	Capcom had a booth where they had six Strider, uh, displays, uh, DuckTales remastered,
10319040	10320960	Monster Hunter, Phoenix Wright.
10320960	10324960	Evidently there was still more people lining up to play, uh, DuckTales than it was for Strider.
10325520	10329040	Oh, that's, that's, oh my gosh.
10331040	10337360	That's, I, I, uh, again, I'm just, uh, I mean, that doesn't make me sad in the same way.
10337360	10341680	The other thing made me sad, but it's just like, I just, I, I weep that, uh, Strider,
10341680	10344880	no one cares. I, I really hope the sales don't reflect that.
10345680	10350960	I, I doubt it, but also everybody was going nuts at the Ubisoft, uh, display because,
10350960	10353600	um, they had Just Dance 2014 out.
10356240	10356880	Oh boy.
10357680	10361680	And I just noticed like while I was recording footage of people dancing, they had some,
10361680	10365040	I think a pinball, PC pinball gaming contest going on.
10365040	10369040	This girl won and walked away with a high-end Nvidia PC, and I thought that was pretty cool.
10369040	10374080	Nice. I think it's pretty cool. There's an ABBA song in Just Dance 2014, just saying.
10374080	10380080	All right, Rama, we got to let you go as we can wrap up the show, but, uh, tune into anime jam
10380080	10384800	session Tuesday at 6 30 Pacific, 9 30 Eastern right after Electric Sisterhood here in VOG.
10385440	10386160	Got that right.
10386160	10387360	All right. Take care, buddy.
10387360	10387920	All right. You too.
10387920	10388400	All right. Bye.
10388960	10389520	Bye.
10389520	10395280	Sadly, I am going to close up the Skype line so, uh, we can, uh, finish up the show.
10395280	10397280	I'm so sorry to those that didn't get through.
10397280	10400960	Uh, you can always email us mailbag at orange lounge, radio.com,
10400960	10402960	but I still have a few tweets to get through.
10402960	10406080	And I don't know if Loki has any last minute stories, but we'll give him a chance to.
10406720	10409760	All right, then let's get to the Twitters as soon as I can bring it up.
10409760	10410080	All right.
10410080	10416160	So Bobby linked us to this article that, uh, says because we all love lists and it was
10416160	10423280	literally a list of Game of Thrones characters as video game consoles.
10423280	10426080	Now I don't watch Game of Thrones, so I kind of looked at the list going.
10426080	10427360	It doesn't make sense to me.
10427360	10430880	Um, but it just seems like the type of thing that they're intentionally baiting people
10430880	10431920	to share on Facebook.
10432480	10437600	Um, which is kind of what some of the internet's turned into and some of what Facebook's turned
10437600	10438000	into.
10438000	10438640	And I don't know.
10440000	10443040	I want to talk about this tweet from ActDeft because I heard about this too.
10443040	10447520	ActDeft tweets us saying, I just learned about the existence of a 3DS version of Chocobo
10447520	10449760	Racing and sadly it got canned.
10449760	10452480	I, I did forget they did announce this.
10452480	10456240	Like when the 3DS first came out, they were like, yeah, we're going to make a Chocobo
10456240	10457280	Racing game for it.
10457280	10459440	Well, it came out this week that that game got canceled.
10460400	10464320	And I'm like, oh, I really liked the PlayStation game.
10464320	10470080	I know it kind of got mixed reviews and some people didn't feel so hot on the game, but
10470080	10472160	I thought the game was really cool.
10472160	10475360	So I'm sad they didn't do Chocobo Racing on 3DS.
10475360	10478640	I would have enjoyed it, but I guess I'll never get to play it.
10478640	10479280	Sniff, sniff.
10480320	10486720	Uh, let's see, uh, Tiger Claw sends us a link here and I will read this here.
10486720	10489760	Russian government to fund patriotic games.
10491120	10491600	Interesting.
10491600	10497360	I'm trying to look at this article cause I haven't heard about this, but, uh, let's see.
10497440	10503840	He links us to an article at GameSpot.com that says, uh, Russians, Russia's culture
10503840	10507920	minister says video games have to be conducive to patriotic education.
10507920	10510480	And if you distort history, you could be banned.
10511360	10514160	It will help fund the production of patriotic games.
10515520	10520480	And it's, uh, comments from, uh, the aid to Russia's culture minister, Vladimir
10520480	10524480	Mandinsky said in an interview with a Russian daily newspaper.
10525280	10530080	And, um, there are several developers that they're in talks with for games to be released
10530080	10531440	through 2014.
10531440	10536400	You know, this is interesting because you might think, Oh, government funded video
10536400	10536800	games.
10536800	10538480	What a crazy idea.
10538480	10539040	Not really.
10539040	10542480	Cause weren't we just hearing on Bobby Blackwell show a couple of weeks ago, he was
10542480	10544480	out there at the CDC game jam.
10544480	10548560	I mean, the CDC is a government arm, so, you know, obviously it wasn't necessarily
10548560	10549840	funding patriotic games.
10549840	10555520	It was funding, you know, awareness of, uh, you know, but I just, I thought it was
10555520	10560880	interesting that, uh, there's patriotic games of a different sense, uh, being made
10560880	10561120	here.
10562240	10564560	Um, let's see if there's any other tweets here.
10564560	10569040	I'll read this very kind tweet from a Soutour who says, uh, OLR helps me face the
10569040	10570080	week each Sunday.
10570640	10571920	Oh, thank you.
10573520	10574240	So there you go.
10575120	10577360	Uh, and then we also got tweeted this picture.
10577360	10579200	I just want to show this dark Sakura.
10579280	10580640	It's a from what?
10580640	10581040	Sorry.
10581040	10584800	Morning Wolf is the name of this tweeter who sent us a picture saying gamer cat
10584800	10586960	approves of the classic game of the week.
10586960	10591600	And there's gamer cat, uh, curled up next to a copy of the animal crossing strategy
10591600	10591840	guide.
10591840	10594320	Cause that was last week's classic game of the week.
10595280	10601920	We like it when you tweet us your cats and, uh, I think that'll do it for, we
10601920	10603840	should have, we should have something.
10603840	10608160	I'm going to start this on the orange lounge tumbler called show us your pussy.
10610000	10611200	I want pictures of cats.
10612080	10614560	Well, those are, there's already a shit ton of those on tumbler.
10614560	10615200	What do you have?
10615200	10616880	My favorite is get out of there cat.
10617920	10618320	All right.
10618960	10620240	That's it for Twitter topics.
10620240	10622560	So that's going to do it for our show tonight.
10622560	10623920	We're going to wrap on up here.

10713760	10714960	and then wrap up and get out of here.
10715520	10718080	I will give my final thought thought first tonight.
10718080	10721760	And my final thought is I'm going to try very hard the rest of this evening
10721760	10724880	to not talk, but doing this show makes me happy.
10724880	10728080	And I'm glad I could push through these past few hours to be here with you
10728080	10728880	tonight.
10728880	10731040	Uh, Loki, your final thought tonight?
10731040	10733120	I have plenty of lots of Grand Theft Auto 5 this week.
10733120	10738480	And stay tuned to the forums, uh, cause we'll have an exact time and day for
10738480	10741520	those VOG gaming nights for Grand Theft Auto online.
10741520	10745120	It's might be in the middle of the week now, but we'll see.
10745760	10746560	All right.
10746560	10747680	You gotta figure that out.
10747680	10750080	And last but not least, Dark Soccer, your final thought.
10750720	10751680	I'm very grumpy.
10753120	10753840	Sorry to hear it.
10754400	10754960	All right.
10754960	10756320	Uh, that's it guys.
10756320	10758000	We're done here at Orange Lounge Radio.
10758000	10760800	We will be back next week to do it all again.
10760800	10765680	I have a wonderful week in the meantime and, um, keep on gaming and have fun.
