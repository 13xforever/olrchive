7000	14000	There's a host, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	18000	This week, a fundraiser could lead to the release of an incomplete Sojam and Earl 3 for the Dreamcast.
18000	25000	Nintendo is re-imagining N64 titles for a release on the Wii U, and they may not be the only company reimagining their past titles.
25000	27000	All this and more begins right now.
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	36000	Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
36000	44000	It is Orange Lounge Radio episode number 525, October the 27th, 2013.
44000	51000	My name is Rob Roberts, here with all you guys to talk about video games and gaming culture and so on and so forth with my co-hosts.
51000	55000	First up, the one and only DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.
55000	57000	I can't tell it pruning.
57000	61000	You can't be gardening, you're in the kitchen slash studio right now.
61000	62000	Oh, Animal Crossing.
62000	63000	She's just like a witch.
63000	65000	Wow, you actually have a little witches hat for your character.
65000	67000	Because I paid money for Gracie items.
67000	68000	Adorable.
68000	69000	I have the full store now.
69000	73000	Wow, you are like really hardcore into this Animal Crossing stuff, it's no joke.
73000	77000	I have two characters that are mine, and I made one for Julian because I'm bribing him.
77000	79000	But I'll talk about that during my gaming week.
79000	82000	I'm really surprised you haven't jumped on the Pokemon bandwagon yet.
82000	85000	Although I understand, you know, you've got the finance issues going on right now and everything.
85000	87000	That is literally the reason.
87000	88000	Oh, okay.
88000	89000	I have no job.
89000	94000	Which would make the Pokemon addiction worse should you somehow come across a copy.
94000	99000	Except, you know, every time I've ever played a Pokemon game, I've gone about halfway through it and just completely lost interest.
99000	101000	It was like, I'm at the gym, let's play a Pokemon game.
101000	108000	I will say the new one is like way, there's just more excitement and a better coat of paint or just something.
108000	112000	It really energizes that whole brand in a way I haven't felt in a very long time.
112000	114000	Well, Hanukkah is coming up, so whatever.
114000	116000	Ask Hanukkah Harry for one.
116000	117000	No.
117000	118000	Alright.
118000	121000	Actually, what I want for Hanukkah is a job.
121000	123000	And then I can buy my own damn Pokemans.
123000	124000	Well, good luck.
124000	125000	Yeah.
125000	126000	Didn't you have an interview last week?
126000	127000	I did, but I haven't heard back.
127000	128000	Alright, fingers in, fingers in.
129000	133000	Okay, do you think it's an encouraging sign when he just says, you have any more questions for me?
133000	135000	And I go, yeah, when do I start?
135000	138000	And he said, I like how you think.
138000	146000	And then telling me that the eight people, however many people before me, you know, I'm just, I don't want to go much too into the interview.
146000	147000	Sure, sure, sure.
147000	150000	Cross your fingers, cross your toes, light some candles, say a prayer, whatever.
150000	153000	I'm trying not to be excited, but I need a prayer circle, Rob.
153000	155000	Alright, let's join hands.
155000	156000	Okay.
156000	159000	Joining us in our prayer circle this evening, say hello to Techmaster Loki.
159000	160000	Hi.
160000	161000	How you doing, Loki?
161000	162000	Doing alright.
162000	163000	Yeah?
163000	171000	I wanted to get better food for dinner other than McDonald's, but I was too busy looking for UFO parts in Grand Theft Auto.
171000	174000	I was like, wait a minute, is that like a toy for Josh?
174000	175000	Oh, it's a Grand Theft Auto thing.
175000	176000	Yeah.
176000	180000	I will tell you this, Loki, I came so close to finally jumping on that Grand Theft Auto 5 bandwagon this week.
180000	184000	We were like, we were at Fry's or Best Buy or one of those stores, and I almost did it.
184000	188000	But then I was like, wait, Rob, you have an unopened copy of Grand Theft Auto 4 sitting on your shelf.
188000	190000	This is not okay.
190000	193000	You can't get on the 5 bandwagon until you at least play some 4.
193000	196000	No, you can get on the 5 bandwagon just fine.
196000	197000	And then Alan is like-
197000	202000	Although, I mean, it will look that much better, but, you know, I still think you can get on the bandwagon without playing 4.
202000	206000	But Alan is like, Alan is like, why don't you just wait?
206000	209000	In like a year there'll be the Steam sale, it'll be 6 bucks on PC.
210000	216000	I mean, granted, we don't really have a PC version confirmed, but we all know it'll probably happen at some point.
216000	221000	So, you know, he's encouraging me to wait, but I'm like, everybody's playing it now.
221000	224000	They're having the VoG night now.
224000	226000	It's fun. You're missing out.
226000	230000	But I need to save my money for the PlayStation 4 and all the games that aren't coming out.
230000	232000	May I interject one thing real quick?
232000	233000	Of course.
233000	234000	Happy birthday to Act Deft.
234000	240000	Yes, happy birthday, or Feliz Cublianos, because he is one of our favorite Mexican listeners after all.
240000	243000	I know we have a couple folks in Mexico that listen, so I don't want to play favorites too much,
243000	246000	but Act Deft has always been a loyal listener of the show and participator,
246000	251000	so I don't mind taking the time out at the top of the show to say happy birthday to Act Deft.
251000	257000	It's not his birthday, but we always are happy to have him here in studio joining us with the show.
257000	263000	Say hello, everybody. It's his un-birthday, so a merry un-birthday to VX JasonXV, or just Jason.
263000	265000	The other Mexican across the table, no less.
265000	267000	How you doing?
267000	268000	Just not living in Mexico.
268000	270000	Quienes.
270000	272000	Doing good.
272000	274000	I had something to say.
274000	277000	Oh, you don't have to wait a whole other week to hear my voice again.
277000	279000	Or three hours in this case, two and a half.
279000	284000	Jason, if you didn't know, Jason is the new VO guy for basically VoG network.
284000	287000	I mean, Bobby does some of the VOs, but you're slowly kind of taking over,
287000	292000	because since you don't have a show right now, you did have one for a while, right?
292000	296000	Not on a network, not affiliated, but I was doing a podcast with some friends for a while.
296000	299000	That was before VoG and all that, right? You were doing that for you?
299000	301000	Probably. It was quite a while ago at this point.
301000	303000	It was all a blur. It was all a blur.
303000	306000	But you do have a great voice, so you've been willing to do some voiceovers,
306000	310000	and I think people finally got sick of Rob with the echoes and all that stuff.
310000	312000	Well, actually, you volunteered. You just said,
312000	317000	Rob, I'm really sick of hearing that damn filter every week, and I'll do it if you need to know.
317000	320000	So I was like, sure, of course, and you've been doing a great job.
320000	326000	I have my microphone set up, sitting nice and ready. I love my studio slash office set up,
326000	331000	and I thought, hey, Rob can always use an extra hour on Sunday, so this is probably a good idea.
331000	337000	I like to think if the worst ever happened, and OLR and Horde House were both suddenly done,
337000	343000	which I don't even like to think about that, but all things come to an end eventually.
343000	346000	Nothing's on the radar yet, folks. I don't want to scare anybody.
346000	349000	But I like to think if these projects were to ever come to an end,
349000	355000	that's kind of what I would want to do. I've been doing this radio amateur stuff so long,
355000	359000	I would have to do something for someone, somewhere.
359000	363000	But I like to think I could just start up another show somewhere, but maybe, I don't know,
363000	368000	maybe in ten years I would not really want to do that anymore, and I'd just do VOs for somebody else.
368000	372000	And you have a ton of expertise that you can provide to someone else for the actual aspects of running a show.
372000	374000	Oh, inflate my ego more.
374000	377000	Producer engineering set up for streaming, recording.
377000	379000	Keep talking, you're my friend.
379000	383000	There's many, many ways to put together a show, live podcast or otherwise.
383000	387000	Everybody could be better, and somebody with expertise could provide that.
387000	393000	Well, I couldn't do this every week, and I don't think Dark Soccer or Loki or even Jason could do this every week either,
393000	395000	if it weren't for the chatters.
395000	400000	So hello to our chat room, live.vognetwork.com, and hello to the podcast listeners as well.
400000	402000	I don't want you guys to feel neglected.
402000	405000	We love everybody who participates with our show in one way or another.
405000	408000	But we do have the live chatters over at live.vognetwork.com.
408000	412000	Tigerclaw says, I wish Rob did the intro with the auto-tune.
412000	414000	I will say this.
414000	422000	We once were looking at doing a segment on the show that was extra for seeing the virtual console release dates.
422000	425000	Back when the Wii was newer and there was a virtual console every week.
425000	428000	Well, that was right when that app came out on iPhone that was like IMT Paint or whatever.
428000	434000	So we were actually looking at having him do that, but there wasn't any easy way for us to get that MP3 rip.
434000	439000	Because we could rip it through the computer, but it didn't really save MP3, so it just didn't work out.
439000	441000	But I would have loved to do that segment with auto-tune.
441000	443000	So it's funny that you bring it to auto-tune.
443000	448000	I can bring in my headset, because I was dumb enough to buy the headset, or I should say,
448000	452000	the collector's edition of Saints Row the Third that had the auto-tune headset.
452000	453000	Wow.
453000	456000	Which, spoiler alert, sucks ass.
457000	462000	But, you can if you sort of try to sing, I guess, over it.
462000	464000	It sort of sounds auto-tuned.
464000	466000	I don't know.
466000	468000	You know what?
468000	470000	We both have Audition.
470000	475000	All I need to do is sit down for an hour and I can probably figure out how to do it.
475000	476000	Well, yeah, no, no.
476000	478000	Keep in mind, this was five years ago.
478000	480000	We have new toys now that we didn't have five years ago.
480000	484000	But we also don't have extra for as my roommate anymore.
484000	486000	So that idea is kind of long gone.
486000	488000	We have the internet.
488000	489000	We do. We do.
489000	491000	But there's no virtual console.
491000	493000	I guess Wii U virtual console games, but it's not...
493000	498000	I remember when the Wii was first out, we were seeing virtual console games all the time.
498000	499000	It was like three a week.
499000	502000	And on Wii U, they've been trickling through.
502000	505000	I feel like every week we're getting something, but let's be real.
505000	508000	It hasn't been a very strong lineup the past week or so.
508000	512000	I think one week we got tennis and baseball.
512000	517000	And those were like the Nintendo versions, like very basic versions of those games.
517000	518000	The launch time.
518000	519000	Yeah, part of the launch lineup.
519000	520000	I mean, they're basically named, for crying out loud.
520000	521000	That tells you when they came out.
521000	522000	Yeah, exactly.
522000	526000	We could do the regular PlayStation Plus member awards.
526000	527000	We'll think of something.
527000	528000	We'll think of something.
528000	529000	This auto-tune thing is...
529000	531000	We're talking about this way too much.
531000	532000	All right.
532000	535000	Let's do a kickoff topic before we get into our gaming weeks.
535000	537000	And we're going to break form a little bit here.
537000	540000	We usually do mailbag later in the show.
540000	544000	But what I'm going to ask Dark Sakura to do, could you open up the email bag for us,
544000	545000	Dark Sakura?
545000	549000	Because there was an email in there that I thought was really good and worth talking
549000	551000	about here at the top of the show.
551000	558000	So Dark Sakura, if you would dive into the email bag and pull out the email that I licked.
558000	560000	The email that you licked?
560000	562000	Yes, it has the saliva all over it.
562000	566000	While I multitask opening my village for everybody who wanted me to do it.
566000	567000	Animals can wait.
567000	568000	Yeah, they can.
568000	570000	I'm just being nice to people.
570000	571000	Hey, OLR crew.
571000	572000	AZHP here.
572000	575000	I wanted to get something off my chest that's been bugging me for a few weeks now.
575000	578000	I had some friends over to play scary games a few weeks ago.
578000	582000	And a lot of them were giving advice on how to play Amnesia.
582000	585000	Then I asked them if anyone wanted to play since they had played it before.
585000	586000	And they said, oh, I haven't played it before.
586000	588000	I watched a playthrough on YouTube.
588000	592000	This got me kind of bummed out because I feel some of the magic of experiencing the game
592000	596000	together with friends was gone because they knew what was going to happen.
596000	600000	When I discovered that watching scary game playthroughs is actually way more common than
600000	601000	I thought.
601000	602000	Then I discovered.
602000	604000	Way more common than I thought.
604000	608000	Some of the most popular videos of the game Outlast have millions of views.
608000	611000	Outlast is an indie game and certainly hasn't sold millions of copies.
611000	614000	So prospects for a sequel are slim at this time.
614000	618000	So my question to you guys is, do you think streaming is hurting certain genres of games?
618000	622000	This is a slightly different discussion than Nintendo streaming kerfluffle that happened
622000	623000	a few months ago.
623000	626000	Because Nintendo games are often games with excellent gameplay and mechanics that makes
626000	630000	you want to play and want to have your own experience with the game.
630000	631000	Even after.
631000	633000	I'm about to get logged out.
633000	635000	Sorry.
635000	638000	Even after watching someone play it.
638000	641000	But is that necessarily the same for horror games?
641000	645000	After seeing the twists and scares, does that make you want to go out and play the game?
645000	650000	And to play Devil's Advocate, were these people just never going to play these games because
650000	652000	they were too scared to play it by themselves?
652000	655000	I feel like with the easy answer being, let's watch a playthrough on YouTube.
655000	659000	These people who watch the stream could have mustered up enough courage to get a friend
659000	663000	or two over and play the game as they are huddled up with blankets over their heads,
663000	665000	gripping each other in fear.
665000	668000	Is this something we may lose forever due to streaming?
668000	670000	I've rambled enough, but I'd love to hear your thoughts on the issue.
670000	671000	Keep up the great work.
671000	672000	Love always.
672000	673000	AZHP.
673000	676000	This is a really good question, and that's why I wanted to pull it at the top of the
676000	680000	show as a kickoff topic, because it's also timely with Halloween being this next week.
680000	684000	A lot of people are thinking about scary games, and I'm sure some of you, I don't know
684000	686000	if you guys do this or maybe people listening, but...
686000	688000	We have to watch Showgirls.
688000	692000	Everybody has their tradition, and mine is watching Showgirls every Halloween because
692000	697000	it's a scary movie, but I'm sure some of you bring people over and you all play Silent
697000	698000	Hill, or you all play Amnesia.
698000	700000	We've done that at your old place with Exeter.
700000	701000	Yeah, certainly.
701000	703000	But this is a really good question.
703000	708000	Just in general, and it doesn't even necessarily have to be about scary games, but is this
708000	713000	new technology in this world that we live in as gamers where Twitch TV is getting more
713000	720000	and more popular and all its knockoffs, is this hurting gaming more than we want to admit?
720000	722000	No, no one really watches it for the twist.
722000	726000	They watch it for the people reacting to playing the games is really what it is.
726000	727000	Not me.
727000	728000	I don't really...
728000	732000	I'm with you, because of course my mind is going to go to, if you listen to Hoard House,
732000	737000	you know our buddy Gemet over there is infamous for doing these playthroughs where he screams
738000	741000	at the top of his lungs while playing Slender Man, and people love it.
741000	742000	They heat it up.
742000	744000	That's why it's so popular.
744000	749000	It's not really about the game itself, which I mean, the game's good, but it's watching
749000	751000	these over the top reactions, which is why people do it, right?
751000	752000	Yeah.
752000	756000	I mean, I saw some footage of Amnesia before.
756000	758000	I just don't remember it.
759000	765000	Well, I remember, and even though I've beaten the game a bajillion times,
765000	770000	I watch playthroughs of Silent Hill 3, because that's my favorite game,
770000	773000	and sometimes I don't feel like putting it in and playing through everything.
773000	775000	I just want to watch all the cinematics.
776000	781000	For me, it's more or less that I go back and rewatch scenes of games that I've already played,
781000	783000	especially scenes that I really like.
784000	788000	The only game, I think, as far as scary games that I've done that with,
788000	791000	are pretty much games I don't intend to ever play.
792000	795000	I want to see exactly how bad this is type of game.
797000	802000	I'm not as much into Resident Evil anymore, so I watch a playthrough of one of the Resident Evil games
802000	805000	just to keep up on the story, but I don't really want to play it.
805000	807000	For me, I don't care.
807000	811000	If someone was like, oh yeah, let's come over and have a bunch of people
811000	814000	while we play through this and make fun of it, that's where you get the fun.
815000	818000	Even if you've already seen it, as long as you're not spoiling it for people,
818000	823000	like your friends were spoiling it for you, then that's the difference.
824000	826000	People just need to have a little bit of respect.
826000	829000	If they know you haven't played through it before, they need to keep their big mouth shut.
829000	831000	I think the emailer brings up a good point, though,
831000	836000	is that there are probably people out there where they're not sure if they want to buy
836000	840000	a scary $10, $15 video game that's out there right now.
840000	842000	Let's say Outlast, I think, was the example used in the email.
842000	845000	Somebody might not be sure if they want to get that game yet,
845000	848000	so they're sampling a little bit on Twitch TV or whatever,
848000	850000	and so they watch somebody play the game, and then they're like,
850000	853000	oh, well, I saw all this scary stuff, so I don't really need to buy it now.
855000	858000	Is that a valid concern for the game makers?
858000	861000	I kind of think it's a decent argument.
861000	864000	Now, I sort of think, though, it's twofold.
864000	868000	I kind of think for every person you convince not to buy the game,
868000	873000	I think there's people you also convince to buy the game that may not have done so before.
873000	875000	So I think there is a little bit of both.
875000	879000	There's the bad news and there's good news that we might be neglecting here a little bit.
879000	881000	Jason, do you have any thoughts on this?
881000	883000	And I invite our chat room to respond, too, at luke.com.
883000	888000	I was basically going to say that I agree with what Loki said
888000	893000	in that there's going to be a lot of people that are going to use this as an excuse
893000	896000	to see a game without playing it, whether it's for saving money,
896000	899000	whether it's for something that they just didn't get a chance to play.
899000	903000	But there's nothing wrong with that for the same exact point that you made,
903000	905000	in that somebody else can get turned on to this.
905000	908000	A game they didn't hear of, a game they were on the fence for,
908000	911000	they see a tiny little bit of it, it interests them,
911000	913000	they want to see the rest of the story around it, and so forth.
915000	917000	There's a lot of games that come out right now,
917000	920000	and nobody plays every single one of them.
920000	925000	So having something that kind of fills the void of being able to see what a game was,
925000	928000	get a story in a universe that you're interested in,
928000	932000	it's not a bad thing. Everybody does not play all of the same games.
934000	935000	Question for you guys at the table.
935000	939000	Have any of you been convinced to buy a video game because of a live stream?
939000	942000	I want to say I did. I can't remember what it is.
942000	949000	Yeah, well not because of a stream, but it showed a lot of the gameplay in a YouTube video.
949000	952000	That's how I bought Drunken Robot Pornography.
952000	956000	I mean, yeah, it was more of a review, but he played through a good bit of what had been out,
956000	958000	and I was like, heck yeah, I want this.
958000	961000	Just listening to the music made me want that game.
961000	967000	I've also picked up indie titles based on going through Twitch and seeing people play.
967000	971000	Surgeon Simulator. 2013.
971000	975000	That video, I had to buy it after watching that.
975000	978000	I can't think of one off the top of my head that I bought,
978000	984000	but I will say that seeing streams convinced me to give Dota 2 a try,
984000	988000	and League of Legends, and I was kind of ignoring those,
988000	990000	but because of all the streaming that goes on with that,
990000	993000	I was kind of convinced like, oh, maybe I can try this too.
993000	995000	That's actually exactly the same point.
995000	1000000	The last time I was out here, I watched The International 3 with some co-workers,
1000000	1003000	and once Dota 2 was finally available for Steam on Mac,
1003000	1008000	I jumped on that and had a couple friends teach me how to play the game.
1008000	1012000	I don't want to say I'm good at it by any stretch of the imagination,
1012000	1015000	but I'm to the point where I can actually learn on my own
1015000	1019000	and sometimes hold up in multiplayer matches.
1019000	1022000	Going to our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com,
1022000	1025000	SSG100Matt says, I really just like watching my friends play games
1025000	1028000	and occasionally do hilarious commentary.
1028000	1031000	AlanAlchemy with a comment that's teasing Gemet,
1031000	1033000	which I'm always here for those.
1033000	1036000	AlanAlchemy says, and how Gemet takes his hands off the mouse and keyboard
1036000	1040000	and slaps him over his face and stops playing the game when he hasn't even died yet.
1040000	1043000	It's hilarious and infuriating.
1043000	1046000	I'm going to get a nasty call on Skype this week.
1046000	1049000	God damn it, Rob Roberts. I heard OLR this week, Rob Roberts,
1049000	1051000	and you were talking shit about me again.
1051000	1053000	The other side of the coin from this email is party games,
1053000	1055000	because party games don't have something that you can spoil.
1055000	1059000	You see something livestream that's really fun and you pick it up immediately.
1059000	1064000	Good point. The first time I saw Mario U was on a livestream.
1064000	1068000	I didn't buy all that right when it first came out,
1068000	1072000	so I kind of saw it all that morning.
1072000	1075000	Let's see. Looking for more comments in our chat room.
1075000	1077000	DarkTetsuya at live.vognetwork.com says,
1077000	1081000	to me it seems like the horror movie trailers or any trailer in general.
1081000	1083000	Sure, maybe you've seen some of the game,
1083000	1085000	but there's still a good chunk that would surprise you.
1085000	1090000	BlackWolf, our good pal Bobby BlackWolf, who always does the show before us here at VOG Network,
1090000	1095000	says, well, I almost bought Final Fantasy XIV because of Sky's livestream,
1095000	1098000	but I was interested in Hearthstone because of his livestream.
1098000	1100000	Interested and almost.
1100000	1103000	ActDeft actually said exactly the same thing that I wasn't even thinking about,
1103000	1105000	is that you played Rogue Legacy,
1105000	1108000	and I'll say this again once we hit our gaming weeks,
1108000	1110000	but I've been playing a good chunk of that.
1110000	1112000	Every time I've seen that game, I very much enjoyed it.
1112000	1113000	It's a good use of your time.
1113000	1114000	It's a great game.
1114000	1117000	Let me read another comment here, just a couple more.
1117000	1119000	Duron in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says,
1119000	1123000	I usually use demos or betas to decide if I want to play a game,
1123000	1126000	but this is a nice way if those options aren't available.
1126000	1127000	That's a very good point.
1127000	1130000	And lastly, I'll say from DungeonBuster here,
1130000	1132000	I was on the fence with Amnesia a while back
1132000	1134000	until I watched a few streams of it and picked it up.
1134000	1141000	So, I mean, a lot of positive, like, yes, the streaming might be doing more good than bad.
1141000	1143000	Not to dismiss the points of the original email, though,
1143000	1145000	but I think there is a little bit of both.
1145000	1148000	I think there's some of what the emailer was saying,
1148000	1150000	and I think there's the other side of,
1150000	1152000	yeah, but there's also another audience that may not have bought the game
1152000	1154000	that is going to buy the game now,
1154000	1158000	because it's their friend or somebody they feel a connection to online,
1158000	1160000	in the case of, like, the more popular live streamers,
1160000	1164000	that, you know, play the game and make it look like a good time.
1164000	1168000	So, all right, anyhow, that'll do it for that topic.
1168000	1169000	Let's get into our gaming weeks.
1169000	1174000	For the record, I actually do totally want to have people in person
1174000	1177000	for a good Silent Hill 3 playthrough.
1177000	1179000	It'll be fun. Good times.
1179000	1182000	Actually, one comment I do need to respond to in chat.
1182000	1185000	Codeman says, Rob, have you played Outlast yet?
1185000	1188000	I have not. Codeman was kind enough to gift me a copy.
1188000	1190000	I will say time is running out for me to do that, though,
1190000	1194000	because Halloween is this week, so stay tuned.
1194000	1196000	And you can't see it, but I'm wiggling my eyebrows.
1196000	1198000	So stay tuned. That'll probably happen this week.
1198000	1202000	All right, let us get to the types of video games that we've been playing this week,
1202000	1205000	and how was your gaming week?
1205000	1207000	DarkSakura, what have you been up to? What have you been playing?
1207000	1209000	I haven't been playing Animal Crossing at all.
1209000	1211000	You're not playing it right now.
1211000	1215000	No, not right now. By the way, Normandy's open.
1215000	1220000	I played Final Fantasy XIV, and I got on a quest that was really pissing me off,
1220000	1222000	so I just said, screw it, and got my second job.
1222000	1227000	So I'm at level 10 Thaumaturge, and when I hit 15, maybe tonight,
1227000	1233000	I'll go back to spamming whatever I have to do as a sorcerer or summoner.
1233000	1235000	I guess. I don't know how that works.
1235000	1243000	Anyway, so I'm playing that. I got Gone Home, but I haven't started it yet.
1243000	1247000	I did play some Super Mario 3D World Land, whatever it is.
1247000	1249000	Oh yeah, that's right, because you borrowed that from me last year.
1249000	1254000	Yes, I did. Whatever 3D stuff. Without the 3D, haha.
1254000	1258000	I also played some Fractal, and I've played Mass Effect 3.
1258000	1264000	I've played the first Mass Effect because I bought Choddy the first two games on PC,
1264000	1267000	and she hasn't been able to get hers to work. I don't know why.
1267000	1272000	So I've been playing mine to walk her through getting all of her stuff set up.
1272000	1276000	And now that I'm in the game, I just can't resist rolling another shepherd.
1276000	1282000	I totally forgot where I was. I have another shepherd that I'm playing as kind of the
1282000	1285000	let's see if we can get Garrus to go with the specter path,
1285000	1289000	which we know that doesn't really happen anyway, so whatever. Spoilers!
1289000	1294000	But I'm playing that one, and I completely forgot where I was.
1294000	1299000	I haven't even done, like, I think I just finished Novaria, and that's it.
1299000	1306000	So I was playing those, and I was playing something else.
1306000	1312000	Oh, Dan has broken out the GameCube and is playing the Mimish Cap.
1312000	1313000	Oh nice.
1313000	1318000	He's like, we've had this game for how long? And I've played it for not how long?
1318000	1321000	I'm gonna play it. So that's what all I've been hearing all morning
1321000	1324000	is a mix of Animal Crossing music and the Mimish Cap.
1324000	1328000	Alrighty. There it is, your gaming week. Loki.
1328000	1330000	I only played Grand Theft Auto 5.
1330000	1331000	What a shock!
1331000	1338000	I know, shocking. So I've been still trying to go through single player and get 100%,
1338000	1340000	so that's what I've been working on.
1340000	1346000	I finished the flight school stuff, even though I wanted to throw a controller
1346000	1348000	when it came to some of the plane stuff.
1348000	1352000	And then I've been doing my collectibles right now.
1352000	1357000	So I'm going through and finding all the letter scraps and all the spaceship parts.
1357000	1362000	And I've got about, what, seven letter scraps left and three spaceship parts.
1362000	1369000	So thankfully, Rockstar has a wonderful map on their social club that I can go in,
1369000	1373000	and it actually updates as I get stuff so I know, okay, I have to go here,
1373000	1377000	have to do this, because no one really wants to just wander the map looking for that shit.
1377000	1382000	I just want it done immediately so I can get on to the next thing.
1382000	1386000	And then I'm playing a little bit of online at work,
1386000	1390000	mostly the PlayStation 3 version, so I'm level 17 in that now.
1390000	1395000	And another VOG gaming night. I think we're gonna take turns on the Fridays,
1395000	1400000	so we'll probably have one next Friday around 8 o'clock.
1400000	1406000	Haven't decided if it's gonna be PS3 or 360 yet. Probably 360, so stay tuned for that.
1406000	1409000	And then, of course, the following week we'll probably do PS3.
1411000	1414000	Alright, so lots and lots of Grand Theft Auto 5.
1414000	1418000	And once again, if you want to join the VOG Club on Grand Theft Auto 5,
1418000	1421000	all the information is in our forums at vognetwork.com.
1421000	1423000	Just click on forums at the top of the screen.
1423000	1431000	Rockstargames.com. I think it's just slash, yeah, slashcrew slash vognetwork.
1431000	1434000	And I think last I checked we had 46 people.
1434000	1435000	Nice.
1435000	1440000	And we now have 50. We hit 50.
1440000	1443000	It's climbing. Awesome.
1443000	1448000	Alright, Jason, our guest here and voiceover guy, what have you been up to?
1448000	1450000	This map is really freaking amazing.
1450000	1454000	I remember when I learned that it was impossible to 100% Just Cause 2,
1454000	1458000	that it would have been really nice to have something that just shows us where all the items are
1458000	1465000	when you get to like a 90-90% completion rate where running all over the continent is just ridiculous.
1465000	1470000	Oh yeah, I still have a few orbs I have to get in Crackdown, the first one.
1470000	1475000	Yeah, same problem. Crackdown is even smaller than Just Cause 2 is, but still...
1475000	1480000	Yeah, something like that that helps you to the most monotonous grinding possible
1480000	1482000	would be incredibly beneficial.
1482000	1486000	As I said earlier, I've been playing a ton of Rogue Legacy
1486000	1491000	and ripping my hair out with that collectively as well as FTL, Faster Than Light,
1491000	1496000	which has been frustrating because even on easy I can't make it all the way across the galaxy
1496000	1500000	and I've been very disappointed of this constantly.
1500000	1504000	I mentioned on Twitter last night that I went out to a friend's house down in San Francisco
1504000	1508000	and I played Artemis, the Starship bridge simulator for the first time.
1508000	1512000	We played for something like four hours.
1512000	1514000	You gave me glance, have you not heard of this before?
1514000	1516000	No I have not, but it sounds interesting.
1516000	1520000	Artemis, I don't know what's new, what's old, but basically what it amounts to
1520000	1524000	is that you have a Starship, up to six of them as a matter of fact.
1524000	1529000	You run either a server, or I think it's one server per ship,
1529000	1536000	and you can have up to eight or nine positions that encompass a Starship bridge.
1536000	1542000	Calms, helm, weapons, engineering, science that actually does shield scanning and whatnot, sector scanning,
1542000	1544000	and then obviously the captain is required.
1544000	1549000	I think you basically have to have at least two players, but the more you have the better it is.
1549000	1555000	And you start the game with a given scenario, you have deep space stations,
1555000	1563000	in our case DS 1-4 to protect wormholes, space whales, minefields that you can use to your advantage
1563000	1567000	or stop paying attention and destroy yourself very quickly.
1567000	1569000	It's an incredible amount of fun.
1569000	1573000	By the way, this game is getting a big response in our chat room here at live.vognetwork.com.
1573000	1575000	BlackWolf says, I love Artemis.
1575000	1578000	Tim trips in chat and says, Artemis is so fun.
1578000	1581000	And SHG100Matt says, Artemis is at PAX East, right?
1581000	1586000	I think it was. I don't remember. I didn't go, but I think it was one of those games.
1586000	1591000	I've seen a ton of footage and the places they can take the main screen, the bridge screen,
1591000	1596000	and make it gigantic and have all of the stations situated strategically.
1596000	1602000	There's an immense amount of potential to take that game, make the experience as fun as possible
1602000	1604000	and as good as you want it to be.
1604000	1608000	I am looking at footage of this game on YouTube that Bobby sent me.
1608000	1611000	Look at that, a Let's Play I'm using to look at the game.
1611000	1613000	So yeah, this looks like they're having fun.
1613000	1616000	They're all kind of sitting around the table on all their little laptops yelling at each other.
1616000	1618000	That's cool.
1618000	1621000	There is an Artemis II version now, which we didn't play.
1621000	1624000	My voice is a little scratchier than usual.
1624000	1628000	And that's because between the five of us at my buddy's place,
1628000	1631000	we were shouting back and forth at each other.
1631000	1638000	Just in the sheer hectic nature, our engineer was balancing power levels for systems
1638000	1643000	and didn't always react to the captain or just in advance I would say,
1643000	1647000	hey engineering, do I have power to maneuverability?
1647000	1649000	That sounds like a lot of fun.
1649000	1650000	It is so fun.
1650000	1655000	I got to be honest though, if they were to slap Star Trek onto this,
1655000	1659000	I know I shouldn't say that because it's an indie game and let it grow and be its own thing,
1659000	1662000	but I have to say, can you imagine if they could slap Star Trek onto this?
1662000	1665000	It would basically be a Star Trek LARP.
1665000	1667000	People would so be there.
1667000	1671000	They tried doing console Star Trek games that just did not take off.
1671000	1675000	With the intent of being a simulator.
1675000	1677000	Well even Raginator wants to know in our chat room,
1677000	1682000	does it help to say engage or make it so or speak like Shatner when playing Artemis?
1682000	1690000	The captain did not take the role of a particular character from any universe like that,
1690000	1694000	but I would use those words because I was doing helm
1694000	1700000	and so we would have the rotation of the ship and you can also have a warp or a jump ship.
1700000	1706000	Jump being you instantly go to a certain place of course and warp the progressively high rate traveling.
1707000	1712000	He'll give me coordinates and I will say locked in or coordinates engaged or jump engaged,
1712000	1715000	10 seconds to jump, all that kind of stuff.
1715000	1721000	We had fun with it and it kind of comes with the territory of us all being the geeks that we are.
1721000	1722000	Of course.
1722000	1725000	We didn't take specific characters, but we had a hell of a lot of fun with it.
1725000	1729000	Tim Trip in our chat room says, I basically pretend it's Star Trek anyways.
1729000	1731000	Okay, it's not just me.
1731000	1735000	Revision3 has a short little video of this game
1735000	1740000	and they are all dressed up in Star Trek appropriate attire, uniforms and everything,
1740000	1742000	color appropriate and the whole thing.
1742000	1747000	I will say that our weapons individual was the space cowboy
1747000	1750000	and he was playing that character very, very well.
1750000	1754000	I'm sorry, I'm just cracking up at chat because Tim Trip follows up with saying,
1754000	1759000	practice is my best Janeway voice, which Xdefer over at Horde House does this so much better than I do.
1759000	1764000	But you know, that's all Tom Paris, Tom, Harry Kim, Harry Kim, Tom Paris, Tom Paris.
1764000	1767000	That's all he does is yell those two names over and over, but it's funny.
1767000	1768000	I've been watching through Voyager.
1768000	1770000	Yeah, it was a good show. It was underrated.
1770000	1772000	So, anyway, all right.
1772000	1773000	You know what?
1773000	1774000	What?
1774000	1775000	No, it wasn't.
1778000	1784000	Voyager was full of bad decision after bad decision and Janeway going, fuck it, I'm Janeway,
1784000	1787000	we're in the middle of Delta Space, I don't have to follow shit.
1787000	1789000	And that's the tale of Voyager.
1789000	1791000	I'm not asking for directions.
1791000	1793000	I am the direction.
1794000	1797000	It's a real trip though to see Janeway on Orange is the New Black.
1797000	1800000	I'm just saying it's a different role for her.
1800000	1801000	Okay, anyhow.
1801000	1803000	Oh shit, that was her.
1803000	1805000	I didn't even realize it after watching.
1805000	1807000	No, it didn't even click.
1807000	1808000	Wow.
1809000	1814000	And there's also McCoy on some cops SWAT something I saw a commercial for.
1815000	1819000	Obviously, Abram vs. McCoy is on some new TV show and that's quite a jump.
1819000	1820000	Oh my God.
1820000	1823000	I love you Game Guru because you know SF Debris.
1823000	1829000	If you ever want to see the funniest mockery of the Janeway voice ever, go to SF Debris.
1830000	1833000	I was going to say, you know, Voyager had some pretty epic guest stars.
1833000	1836000	Like Sarah Silverman was a guest star on an episode of Voyager.
1836000	1840000	And she wasn't being her typical over the top hilarity.
1840000	1843000	She was playing it serious, so it's so funny to see her on the show.
1844000	1847000	You know, like, I'm going on the Voyager.
1847000	1852000	I just can't help but think always though of Maria Bamford doing her,
1852000	1856000	I used to work at the Star Trek experience as a Bajoran.
1856000	1859000	Her Bajoran refugee voice.
1859000	1862000	I can never get that out of my head whenever I think of Star Trek.
1862000	1867000	Bobby Black Wolf says, I hear Orange is the New Black is better if you pretend it's just Janeway in the holodeck.
1867000	1869000	It could be her fantasy.
1870000	1873000	This is getting way too far away from video games. Way too far.
1873000	1876000	Just the expanse of the Star Trek universe.
1876000	1878000	Look what this Artemis game does to people.
1878000	1879000	Alright, I'm kidding.
1879000	1885000	I think we've also just admitted that we know way too much about Voyager than we should say in public.
1886000	1889000	I know nothing about Voyager other than, you know...
1890000	1895000	I will however watch an entire season of Voyager before I watch any more Enterprise.
1895000	1896000	There you go.
1896000	1900000	You know, true story, the first time I ever got drunk was at the Star Trek experience.
1900000	1903000	First time in my life I ever got drunk was at the Warp Core Breach.
1903000	1904000	I love those things.
1904000	1909000	Fucking Travis over at Understation Live here at VOG Network has the voicemail thing.
1909000	1911000	Anyway, long story that I'm not going to recap.
1911000	1915000	By the way, I did find in Las Vegas a replacement for the Warp Core Breach.
1915000	1916000	Oh, what's that?
1916000	1919000	It's at this place at the Paris casino.
1919000	1926000	Their little dessert bar, whatever place, has fuzzy drinks with foam coming up out of it like the Warp Core Breach.
1926000	1929000	And whatever their red one is tastes like Warp Core Breach.
1929000	1930000	Nice.
1930000	1933000	I just don't remember what it was called. It was red and I was drunk.
1933000	1935000	Nice. I gotta go to Vegas one of these times.
1935000	1940000	A friend of mine is trying to talk me into going to New Media Expo, which I think is right around the time as CES.
1940000	1944000	So it's like, oh, if I could do a double and do both those cons it would be a lot of fun.
1944000	1948000	But anyway, let's talk about my gaming week and the type of stuff that I've been playing this week.
1948000	1953000	Which, you know, much like Loki, I still have been playing plenty of Final Fantasy XIV.
1953000	1956000	We perfected earlier today speedruns of Wanderer's Palace.
1956000	1959000	Which, if you know the endgame, that's one of the instances that you can do in the endgame.
1959000	1962000	And we're able to knock that place out in about 15 minutes.
1962000	1967000	Which doesn't beat the record of 8 minutes, but it's still pretty good considering we don't have the optimal group.
1967000	1970000	But anyway, other games I've been playing this week.
1970000	1975000	Not a whole lot of new stuff, but I did play a new port of a game I already played.
1975000	1977000	And that's Hotline Miami.
1977000	1982000	Because Hotline Miami is free on PlayStation Plus right now on PlayStation 3 and PS Vita.
1982000	1986000	And if you are a PlayStation Plus subscriber, you really do need to check out this game.
1986000	1990000	I can't confess to having played a lot of it.
1990000	1996000	Just because it's really difficult and kind of, like, it takes a bit of getting used to the game.
1996000	1998000	But I really like the style.
1998000	2003000	It's got, you know, a very retro style to it, but the soundtrack is so good.
2003000	2004000	And I'm sure a lot of people are...
2004000	2005000	Isn't it?
2005000	2006000	Oh yeah, it's great.
2006000	2007000	I love the soundtrack.
2007000	2010000	I just sit there and listen to that on loop as I'm dying over and over.
2010000	2015000	But it's a very fast-paced game, and in the retro sense, I find a lot of it is about memorization.
2015000	2021000	Like, okay, here, you're going to go onto this floor in this house that you're invading for whatever reason.
2021000	2025000	And I'm going to go kill that guy, and then I'm going to take his weapon, and then go kill that guy, and that guy.
2025000	2028000	And then I've got to run over here and lure that guy out so I can kill him.
2028000	2030000	Like, you start to think of the memorization.
2030000	2032000	Like, it's a Mega Man level or something, like in retro.
2032000	2035000	So, you know, I know that it's a lot of trial and error.
2035000	2040000	But unfortunately for me, I tend to error a lot more than I do succeed.
2040000	2044000	But it's something about the soundtrack of that game kind of, like, gets you going.
2044000	2046000	And yeah, I want to play more of that.
2046000	2048000	So I was having a lot of fun with that on PlayStation 3.
2048000	2052000	So again, if you have PlayStation Plus, check it out.
2052000	2053000	It's free.
2053000	2056000	You really have no reason at this point not to.
2056000	2059000	And even, I'm sure it'll be discounted on Steam.
2059000	2062000	And I don't think it's a very expensive game to begin with on any of the platforms it's on.
2062000	2068000	So it's worth the money if you like old retro puzzle memorization games.
2068000	2073000	And if you like an abundance of violence with your retro games.
2073000	2077000	Because I will tell you, there's an abundance of violence in this game.
2077000	2079000	And shooting dogs.
2079000	2082000	Alan Alchemy in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com backing us up.
2082000	2085000	It absolutely needs memorization to get through it.
2085000	2087000	So, all right.
2087000	2088000	Let's see.
2088000	2090000	Other games that I've been playing this week.
2090000	2092000	I did play a game.
2092000	2094000	It's not a new game, but it's new to me.
2094000	2096000	It's called Midway Arcade Origins.
2096000	2099000	Which is a retro game collection that's available.
2099000	2101000	I think it's on 360 and PS3.
2101000	2103000	Don't know about Wii or Wii U.
2103000	2104000	I don't think it's there.
2104000	2106000	I think it's only on the others.
2106000	2108000	Here's the thing.
2108000	2111000	The Midway game collection's kind of been done before.
2111000	2113000	And I actually rented this.
2113000	2115000	Because I was a little hesitant to buy it.
2115000	2120000	Because, well, I already have Midway Arcade Treasures on PlayStation 2.
2120000	2122000	Like, there's three different volumes of it, right?
2122000	2123000	I have all three volumes.
2123000	2127000	So most of the games in this I already have in one way or another.
2127000	2131000	And I think they even had on the PlayStation 1 some of these games were available.
2131000	2135000	And it's kind of funny because some of these games we've seen before this generation.
2135000	2139000	Joust was an early $5 Xbox Live arcade game.
2139000	2142000	And that's in the collection now for, you know, what?
2142000	2146000	I find this for $19.99 on Amazon at this point or gaming stores to buy this new.
2146000	2149000	And I'm trying to think of some of the other games.
2149000	2151000	I think Defender. Wasn't Defender an Xbox Live game at some point too?
2151000	2152000	I think they redid that.
2152000	2155000	Well, anyway, those are some of the games that are in the collection.
2155000	2157000	Some of the other highlights for me.
2157000	2159000	Marble Madness. Love that game, right?
2159000	2161000	That's in the collection.
2161000	2163000	Rampart is a personal favorite of mine.
2163000	2168000	That's the game that's like Tetris meets you roll the trackball around and shoot things.
2168000	2169000	The ships.
2169000	2171000	I don't know if you guys know this game.
2171000	2174000	Rampart was really cool. Google it if you haven't heard of it yet.
2174000	2177000	Or maybe Dark Soccer will do it as a classic game later.
2177000	2178000	Maybe.
2178000	2179000	Don't you like Rampart?
2179000	2180000	Not really.
2180000	2187000	But I will tell you, this was the game that I don't think was in any of the older collections that I was really giddy.
2187000	2190000	And it's Super Offroad.
2190000	2193000	Which originally used to be Iron Man Stewart's Super Offroad.
2193000	2196000	But I guess since, you know, they don't have the license with him anymore.
2196000	2199000	Just like Punch Out isn't Mike Tyson anymore.
2199000	2202000	Exactly. They gave him a mustache and just photoshopped his name out.
2202000	2204000	So now it's just Super Offroad or whatever.
2204000	2206000	But I had a lot of fun playing that game.
2206000	2212000	Although I will say, it loses a little something when you don't have the steering wheel that you can just spin around uncontrollably.
2212000	2215000	Remember, like, they were totally fake steering wheels.
2215000	2217000	And they had no stop on the left or the right side.
2217000	2221000	So when you were a kid, you would just spin that thing like crazy when you're trying to turn around.
2221000	2222000	And it was a lot of fun.
2222000	2226000	It doesn't translate the same way to the thumb sticks.
2226000	2229000	But it's an awful lot of fun to kind of have that whole experience.
2229000	2231000	Because I don't remember an arcade perfect version of that.
2231000	2234000	I know on the NES they had a version of that.
2234000	2239000	But it was a little, you know, scaled down in the graphics and so forth.
2239000	2244000	Although it was one of the few, if I remember, it was one of the few four player multi-tap games on the NES.
2244000	2245000	If I'm not mistaken.
2245000	2249000	They redid it on the SNES too that dramatically improved on the NES version.
2249000	2251000	I don't think it was arcade perfect.
2251000	2253000	And, you know, probably intentionally so.
2253000	2257000	The lack of credits and coins and the need to re-up and that kind of thing.
2257000	2263000	Yeah, I remember when I was a kid, if ever there was a Super Off-Road strategically positioned in a walkable area.
2263000	2270000	I would walk by and just throw all the steering wheels so they're all spinning uncontrollably in the same direction.
2270000	2277000	DarkTetsuya and GameGuru, both in our chatroom, telling me that Midway Treasures 3 actually did have Super Off-Road in it.
2277000	2279000	I just don't remember that.
2279000	2281000	And to be honest, I'm looking over at my collection.
2281000	2284000	I actually have Midway Arcade Treasures 1 and 2, so I guess I never picked up 3.
2284000	2287000	3 had Hydro Thunder and it was all racing games, right?
2287000	2288000	I wonder why I skipped that one.
2288000	2292000	I remember having to seek out 3 on the PS2 for a very specific purpose.
2292000	2296000	And I don't think it was Off-Road, but I know there was some other game that I wanted in it.
2296000	2300000	So anyway, as far as retro classic game collections go, it's fine.
2300000	2303000	Especially if you don't have these games already in one way or the other.
2303000	2305000	It's kind of neat to have them again.
2305000	2309000	And yeah, they've got the leaderboard and the trophies and, you know, that's that.
2309000	2311000	Otherwise, you know, not a lot to scream about.
2311000	2317000	But if you're a retro gaming fan, it's really nice to see them in the crisp HD.
2317000	2319000	And you can put different filters on the graphics too.
2319000	2321000	You can have it super sharp or smooth, you know.
2321000	2323000	So you can do those little things.
2323000	2330000	And, you know, especially now that the title is a budget title, it would be worth your time if you like retro games.
2330000	2333000	Anyhow, that does it for my gaming week.
2333000	2335000	So let's quickly do some housekeeping.
2336000	2339000	Don't forget you can add us on Twitter, twitter.com slash o-l-r.
2339000	2342000	And we're also on Facebook, facebook.com slash orange lounge radio.
2342000	2344000	We appreciate all our friends on those sites.
2344000	2347000	We're also on Google Plus, as we'll get to later in the show.
2347000	2354000	And I do want to remind you guys, I mentioned this last week and just want to remind you guys, there will be no new show in two weeks.
2354000	2356000	We will have the night off.
2356000	2360000	So we'll be here next week on November 3rd, if I'm thinking right with the dates.
2360000	2366000	But we will not be here on November 10th, because I will be coming back from Los Angeles and my not BlizzCon trip.
2366000	2368000	And I get to trash your house.
2368000	2371000	Dark Sakura will be house sitting and Kitty sitting.
2371000	2373000	I got paid in Duffy.
2373000	2375000	Yes, as she kindly offered to do.
2375000	2377000	I would have done it for free.
2377000	2378000	I know.
2378000	2379000	But thanks for the Duffy.
2379000	2381000	You're welcome. I've been sitting on that for like three months.
2381000	2382000	Now?
2382000	2384000	Not literally.
2384000	2386000	But anyway, yeah, we won't be here November 10th.
2386000	2388000	I'm going on my not BlizzCon trip.
2388000	2390000	You'll probably hear more about this on Horde House.
2390000	2395000	But I missed out on getting BlizzCon tickets because I thought I would be doing something else that weekend.
2395000	2397000	And it unfortunately fell through.
2397000	2400000	It's kind of a sad situation, but it is what it is.
2400000	2402000	And I'm no longer going to Phoenix.
2402000	2406000	So I said, fine, I'll go to BlizzCon, except there's no way I can get a ticket now.
2406000	2410000	And, you know, BlizzCon is a fortress to get in its media.
2410000	2412000	You're either on their list or you're not.
2412000	2417000	So I'm just going to go to the parties and then go to Disneyland, which is BlizzCon enough, right?
2417000	2418000	BlizzCon.
2418000	2420000	Yeah, exactly. I'm making a BlizzCon out of it. Why not?
2420000	2425000	Well, seriously, you run into people in the park because I did that a couple years ago when they...
2425000	2427000	Not when they... They didn't have it last year, but the year before.
2427000	2428000	Right, yeah.
2428000	2431000	I actually would run into people who are wearing like WoW t-shirts and say,
2431000	2434000	BlizzCon! And they go, hell yeah!
2434000	2436000	So yeah, that'll be on Sunday.
2436000	2440000	That was when I was really into WoW and Dan would just roll his eyes and go wander in the other direction.
2440000	2444000	Yeah, BlizzCon is on the Sunday, the official BlizzCon, but we're making a run of it.
2444000	2446000	I'm going to be going to an event. I should plug this.
2446000	2450000	If you're going to be at BlizzCon and for whatever reason you're not listening to Horde House, my other show,
2450000	2455000	I'm going to be at an event called World of Podcasts, which is Thursday night. I'll be there.
2455000	2460000	I'm not featured because, again, I wasn't planning on going, so I missed the boat on all that stuff.
2460000	2463000	But Grandpa from our show is on one of the panels over there.
2463000	2466000	So yeah, I'll be at World of Podcasts, so if you're going to be there, come say hi.
2466000	2468000	And say hi to Grandpa as well.
2468000	2472000	And then I don't know, whatever else I get invited to Friday or Saturday, we'll go to that too.
2472000	2476000	Although Alan and I are going to try to do a Carthay Circle dinner one of those nights.
2476000	2480000	Probably Saturday night, because I think that's when the closing ceremonies are,
2480000	2483000	so there's usually not a lot going around because they usually have a big old concert.
2483000	2487000	Although they didn't announce any big, there's no Ozzy Osbourne or anything this year.
2487000	2490000	So I don't know what they're doing for the closing ceremonies. It's got to be a secret.
2490000	2492000	It's a secret to everybody.
2492000	2494000	It is a secret to everybody.
2494000	2499000	Alright, let's move on with some gaming news.
2499000	2501000	And Loki, going to start us off tonight.
2501000	2506000	Alright, there's a rumor that's, I guess, going on, saying that there's going to be a brand new...
2506000	2511000	Sorry, you know it's a slow gaming week when we have to start off, or a slow news week in gaming,
2511000	2513000	when we have to start off with a rumor.
2513000	2517000	So I apologize in advance, but it's not the best week in news.
2517000	2518000	There's nothing to talk about.
2518000	2522000	Yeah, we're stretching tonight. Fully admitting. Fully admitting.
2522000	2528000	Like, Lisa, I'm not covering that story about NASCAR being, you know, the rights for NASCAR going to Deep Silver,
2528000	2530000	because no one fucking cares.
2531000	2537000	Anyways, I know there's Regnut out there who still has his gaming console that he stole.
2537000	2545000	So there's this series that, I guess, they're calling Reimagined, because that's dumb.
2545000	2552000	It's supposed to be, I guess, seven Nintendo 64 games that are being redone in HD.
2552000	2559000	And, God, I hope they're really actually redoing everything if they're actually going to do this and not just upresing them,
2559000	2561000	because it's going to look like shit.
2561000	2564000	It's also going to look weird, too, because they're not going to be all fuzzy and cloudy anymore.
2564000	2571000	They're also saying that, I guess, all seven games would feature new content and retail at $30.
2571000	2580000	And the idea is, I guess, Nintendo would be filling in the gaps in their Wii U lineup by re-releasing older Nintendo 64 games.
2580000	2584000	Here's kind of a funny part, though, about that, is they are already filling...
2584000	2591000	Well, I should say their lineup is already including older games that are being remade, like Wind Waker HD, for example.
2591000	2600000	Or even before the Wii U, they had their new play control games, which they literally did nothing to except for change the control on it.
2600000	2606000	Oh, hey, now it uses a Wii remote instead of a GameCube controller, because that's so much better.
2606000	2608000	It's not, though.
2609000	2614000	And, yeah, one of the rumors, of course, is that Mario 64 is going to be the first game.
2614000	2617000	Yeah, of course it's going to be Mario 64.
2617000	2619000	They're not going to do Superman 64.
2619000	2621000	Hey, let's leave with that.
2621000	2624000	Mario Kart 64 would cannibalize a little bit on Mario Kart 8.
2624000	2630000	I don't think... I mean, I could see them doing something like this, but I would think, if anything,
2630000	2636000	I just don't know how much of a draw there's really going to be for people to get HD versions of these games.
2636000	2642000	I mean, I'm sure some people will be interested in it, but I don't know.
2642000	2646000	I would think they'd be better off just doing, like, you know...
2646000	2652000	I could see this maybe for, you know, the 3DS, because remember they did this with, like, you know,
2652000	2659000	Alcarina and Star Fox and that kind of stuff. I could see that happening, but...
2661000	2664000	I don't know. It just sounds like a rumor to me. Whatever.
2665000	2673000	Well, you know, I realize it's a big old rumor, and Nintendo remaking their games wouldn't exactly be out of character for them or whatever, right?
2673000	2674000	No, yeah.
2674000	2682000	But, you know, it seems like it's not a very long process for them, and the games turn out pretty well received.
2682000	2684000	Like, I'm thinking of the Zelda Wind Waker HD thing.
2684000	2690000	Yeah, but the problem with Wind Waker HD, though, is that it had way better graphics than, you know, the GameCube...
2690000	2696000	Well, because it was a GameCube game. It wasn't that different than, you know, a regular Wii game or something like that.
2696000	2700000	So it wasn't... They weren't doing a whole lot.
2700000	2708000	Whereas if you were doing Mario or, like, any of the Nintendo 64 stuff, you're going to have to do quite a bit to that to make it look nice.
2708000	2714000	Because just up-resing it and making the polys look nicer and stuff, it's going to look like...
2714000	2721000	I mean, fuck, you can just pull it up on YouTube and look at any of the emulators out there that do any sort of up-scaling on that stuff, and it just...
2721000	2723000	It doesn't look that good.
2723000	2729000	Like, even when I ran stuff in, like, an emulator on, like, the Ouya and stuff, and that sort of did some up-resing and stuff,
2729000	2736000	it just doesn't look good on your TV because, yeah, everything's smoother looking, but it's just so empty because those games, you know, couldn't...
2736000	2743000	They couldn't do very far draw distances or, you know, they didn't have a lot of detail in there because it couldn't handle it.
2743000	2746000	It's just... I don't know.
2746000	2750000	It's a neat idea, but I just don't know how well it's going to look.
2750000	2752000	We'll see, I guess.
2752000	2754000	SSJ100Matt with a comment in our chat room.
2754000	2760000	At live.vognetwork.com, the recent Mario Kart games have had the older tracks remade into the new games.
2760000	2763000	That's another good reason why a Mario Kart 64 would be a little redundant.
2763000	2767000	Yeah, you know, as much as I like playing the older tracks, I think that's such a cop-out of, like,
2767000	2771000	hey, look, we get double the content now without having to do anything.
2771000	2775000	Well, it would be really... I do think they could release a bunch of old tracks as DLC.
2775000	2777000	I think that would be really cool.
2777000	2778000	So why not?
2778000	2781000	Why not have the balls and put a fucking track editor in there?
2781000	2785000	Oh, you afraid that people are going to come up with better track designs than your own?
2785000	2789000	But, Loki, somebody might draw a penis as a track.
2789000	2792000	Not me. I've decided I know what track I would design.
2792000	2793000	Boobs.
2793000	2794000	No, even better.
2794000	2795000	What?
2795000	2797000	I would have the full-on vag track.
2797000	2799000	You know, with the little lube.
2799000	2801000	I knew you were dirtying it up somewhere.
2801000	2802000	Oh, come on.
2802000	2806000	I think it's, like, totally unfair to automatically assume that people are going to put a penis in
2806000	2808000	when it is much better to put a vag in.
2808000	2809000	Well, my next guess was boobs.
2809000	2810000	Oh, okay. I'll tell you why.
2810000	2813000	I'll tell you why it's easy for people to put a penis in there, because
2813000	2815000	who is the demographic for these games?
2815000	2818000	Teenage boys and prepubescent boys.
2818000	2819000	What have they seen?
2819000	2821000	They've seen their penis.
2821000	2822000	What have they not seen?
2822000	2823000	They have not seen a vagina.
2823000	2826000	And this would be the only way they ever would.
2827000	2829000	So, of course, it's gonna-
2829000	2830000	I would be doing them a favor.
2830000	2832000	It's familiar territory.
2832000	2835000	You didn't see fucking Bob Ross painting buildings and cars.
2835000	2838000	You saw him painting trees, because that's the way he knew.
2838000	2839000	He knew trees.
2839000	2841000	Just like kids, they know penises.
2841000	2842000	And bushes.
2842000	2846000	If you want to be technical, it had to do with his painting style, but that's a different thing.
2846000	2849000	God dammit, I want to see a fuzzy fucking building.
2849000	2850000	He can do it.
2850000	2851000	Alan Alchemy.
2851000	2852000	From the grave.
2852000	2856000	Alan Alchemy in our chatroom at live.voguenetwork.com suggesting a name for your track, Dark Soccer,
2856000	2857000	of Vulva Vroom.
2857000	2859000	I approve of this.
2859000	2861000	It will officially be called the Vulva Vroom.
2861000	2867000	I think Dark Soccer should have, like, a sex education game on the Wii U.
2867000	2871000	Like, you know, instead of Dr. Joyce Brothers or whatever, or Dr. Ruth-
2871000	2872000	Foost, do you lose-
2872000	2874000	I can't do the Dr. Joyce.
2874000	2878000	No, it'll be more like the sex education teacher in Beavis and Butthead.
2878000	2879000	Dark Soccer would just walk out.
2879000	2881000	Today we're gonna talk about the penis.
2881000	2883000	We're gonna talk about the vagina.
2883000	2884000	That's the coach.
2884000	2885000	Oh yeah, I'm sorry.
2885000	2886000	Whatever he was.
2886000	2887000	Isn't he the same guy?
2887000	2888000	Yeah.
2888000	2889000	He'd feel like all the alternative-
2889000	2890000	Coach Buzzcut.
2890000	2891000	Yeah.
2891000	2892000	Kick me in the jibby.
2892000	2900000	So is that like, you know, Mario teaches typing, it's Birdo teaches sex ed or something like that?
2900000	2905000	Teaching- this is all the stuff that I didn't want and I had it changed.
2905000	2909000	So, you could even have it on the Wii U.
2909000	2914000	You could be like, now touch where you're gonna find the G spot.
2914000	2919000	And then the person touches, no, this is why you'll never get laid.
2919000	2922000	Show me on the touchpad where they touched you.
2922000	2925000	You get the orgasm trophy.
2925000	2927000	They don't have trophies on Wii U, Dark Soccer.
2927000	2930000	Well, I don't have a Wii U, so I don't care.
2930000	2935000	And-
2935000	2936000	Was there more with that, Loki?
2936000	2937000	I'm sorry.
2937000	2939000	I think I cut you off and suddenly we-
2939000	2940000	No, we were done talking.
2940000	2942000	We were in playground chat at that point.
2942000	2943000	We were done talking.
2943000	2944000	It's a rumor.
2944000	2945000	Rumor, rumor, rumor.
2945000	2946000	Rumor, rumor, rumor.
2946000	2950000	There's another joke there about the name of the game and for some strange reason I
2950000	2952000	just can't put the words together.
2952000	2954000	Something something and we use-
2954000	2956000	What was the name of this game?
2956000	2957000	Reumagined?
2957000	2958000	Reumagined, yes.
2958000	2959000	Reumagined.
2959000	2963000	It honestly sounds like a special episode of RuPaul's Drag Race.
2963000	2965000	Like, Ru-U-magined or something.
2965000	2966000	Is that what they're calling it?
2966000	2968000	Is that what the Lost episodes that they're calling it on TV right now?
2968000	2970000	You know I've never watched an episode of that.
2970000	2971000	The Ruvives episodes.
2971000	2973000	How are we friends?
2973000	2974000	I mean to.
2974000	2976000	I used to watch Drag U.
2976000	2977000	Oh, okay.
2977000	2978000	Well, similar.
2978000	2979000	Then you know enough.
2979000	2984000	Because I like seeing, as much as Ru makes a gorgeous woman, I loved the suits.
2984000	2985000	It was all about the suits.
2985000	2986000	That red suit.
2986000	2987000	Ah.
2987000	2988000	Tim Tripp in our chat says,
2988000	2991000	I just had a moment where I thought I was listening to Hoard House, but we didn't have
2991000	2993000	Grandpa say something racially insensitive.
2993000	2996000	So it's not truly an episode of Hoard House at this point.
2996000	2998000	Let's move on quickly before we go there.
2998000	3002000	Maybe I'm just channeling X to fur in an entirely feminine manner.
3002000	3005000	I haven't brought up, you know, bleaching the part.
3005000	3009000	Next story is about Nintendo as well.
3009000	3012000	Talking about cross-play titles.
3012000	3018000	You know right now most cross-play we think of on PlayStation with PS3 or 4 and the PlayStation Vita.
3018000	3021000	In fact Hotline Miami, I was talking about earlier in the show.
3021000	3024000	When you download that you get a Vita version and a PlayStation 3 version.
3024000	3027000	And all your saves transfer through the cloud.
3027000	3029000	It's all through the cloud.
3029000	3031000	So you can pick up your bloody murder right where you left off.
3031000	3035000	And so a lot of people are asking, well when the hell is the 3DS and the Wii U gonna get on board?
3035000	3039000	And of course the answer is when Nintendo understands online.
3039000	3045000	Or it's when they decide, because I have to remind everybody every single week.
3045000	3047000	It's when they decide to, hey guess what?
3047000	3052000	We're gonna do the 3DS virtual console on the Wii U.
3052000	3055000	Because it has two screens and the same damn controls.
3055000	3057000	And you can fucking do any 3DS game on there.
3057000	3059000	They're just not doing it yet.
3059000	3062000	Alright well Nintendo has come out and said quote.
3062000	3070000	We can confirm that cross-platform functionality is possible in certain titles that play on Nintendo 3DS and Wii U.
3070000	3072000	As well as, I almost said Vita.
3072000	3075000	As well as other video game systems not made by Nintendo.
3075000	3077000	And the reasoning behind that, just so you know.
3077000	3079000	This is because of pure chess.
3079000	3082000	Which you can actually play on the Wii U.
3082000	3085000	But you can also cross-play with Playstation 3 and Vita.
3085000	3087000	Now the reason why this is news.
3087000	3094000	Is because this is a huge reason why you do not see Final Fantasy XIV on the Xbox 360.
3094000	3096000	Square wanted to put it on the 360.
3096000	3101000	But Microsoft said, no we will not support the cross-play element.
3101000	3105000	You will not be able to, Xbox has to be its own server, its own world and everything.
3105000	3107000	Xbox will not cross-play.
3107000	3113000	Which is funny because Final Fantasy XI was totally not like that and had play online.
3113000	3116000	But you have to go back a few years.
3116000	3120000	Microsoft was desperate to have a Final Fantasy game on the 360.
3120000	3123000	So they broke their own rule in that case only.
3123000	3127000	And that's why you got 13 later on on the 360 which was controversial.
3127000	3129000	But I digress, back to Nintendo.
3130000	3135000	We are committed to helping developers realize the full potential of their software on Nintendo systems.
3135000	3138000	We can confirm that Disney Infinity from Disney Interactive Studios.
3138000	3142000	Cubeman 2 from 3 Sprockets and Pure Chess from Ripstone.
3142000	3145000	All have the ability to play on Nintendo systems.
3145000	3149000	While at the same time communicating with consumers using those same games on other systems.
3149000	3152000	Additional games using this functionality are in development.
3152000	3153000	Smash Brothers.
3153000	3155000	I thought that, well not cross system.
3155000	3159000	I didn't think that the Wii U had an online portion for Disney Infinity.
3159000	3163000	Because I know they were, I think maybe it was limited to two players only.
3163000	3167000	But I thought that that was something that was taken out of.
3167000	3170000	I can't speak first hand because I haven't played Disney Infinity.
3170000	3171000	Maybe I'm thinking the Wii version.
3171000	3172000	I'm not aware of that.
3172000	3174000	I think you're thinking of either the regular Wii version.
3174000	3177000	But I think the Wii U is comparable to the other systems.
3177000	3179000	So I don't think that's, maybe somebody in chat knows.
3179000	3181000	Well it's nice that different consoles play together.
3182000	3184000	I wish it was kind of like that for everything.
3184000	3187000	Instead of this nonsense that we have going on now.
3187000	3189000	It's a little weird to me that Microsoft won't allow it.
3189000	3194000	Because what is one of the big features that they're touting on the Xbox One that has nothing to do with video games?
3194000	3195000	Anybody?
3195000	3196000	TV, TV, TV, TV.
3196000	3198000	What do you do when you watch TV?
3198000	3199000	You can.
3199000	3200000	TV.
3200000	3201000	What can you do by moving your hand?
3201000	3202000	You can.
3202000	3203000	Anyone?
3203000	3204000	Anyone?
3204000	3205000	You can Skype.
3205000	3206000	Flip off the characters.
3206000	3207000	That's it.
3207000	3208000	Skype.
3208000	3210000	But isn't Skype cross platform by default?
3210000	3212000	I can Skype on my iPhone.
3212000	3214000	I can Skype on my computer.
3214000	3217000	So why is Skype okay?
3217000	3218000	Is it because it's a Microsoft product?
3218000	3219000	I don't know.
3219000	3221000	Why is Skype okay when all this other stuff isn't?
3221000	3223000	Microsoft bought Skype.
3223000	3225000	It is now.
3225000	3227000	Obviously it didn't start as one for a long time.
3227000	3229000	It's touting Skype.
3229000	3234000	Oh you can Skype your other Xbox One playing, owning individuals.
3234000	3237000	Well that's just the same voice and video chat they've already had on their network.
3237000	3240000	If you go to Skype.com you have that whole Metro look.
3240000	3245000	And to go on yet another tangent away from what the story was supposed to be about, but
3245000	3250000	I can't help myself, Skype, very controversial patch coming soon to Skype.
3250000	3257000	And the 6.1 patch that's due out in December, they are going to block third party apps.
3257000	3262000	And this is very controversial because many people record their podcasts over Skype using
3262000	3264000	a program like Call Graph.
3264000	3266000	We actually did Hoard House with that for a while.
3266000	3268000	Or Pamela I think one is called.
3268000	3272000	There's all these different programs people use in Skype to do their podcasts.
3272000	3275000	They're going to be screwed because Skype is disabling access to this.
3275000	3280000	Oh I kind of figured you would have meant things like there's a lot of instant messaging
3280000	3285000	apps that can use Skype for text messaging but not voice and video calls.
3285000	3288000	Yeah so it's a very controversial thing going into effect.
3288000	3290000	Thank you Xbox One.
3290000	3294000	It won't affect this show or Hoard House because we don't do it that way.
3294000	3296000	Even though Hoard House is done over Skype, everything.
3296000	3300000	I have a sound card that supports a native recording of what you hear.
3300000	3304000	And so if you are a podcaster out there wondering like shit, shit, what am I going to do?
3304000	3305000	Shit.
3305000	3309000	I really urge you to look for a Sound Blaster brand card that has a feature in it called
3309000	3311000	What You, the letter you, hear.
3311000	3314000	And it's made recording for this show so much easier.
3314000	3317000	And I think if you're willing to drop the 40 bucks on like an external sound card it'll
3317000	3319000	save you a lot of trouble too.
3319000	3320000	If it's in your budget.
3320000	3323000	I know it's not in everybody's budget but yeah.
3323000	3326000	We've been using the same, just to put it in perspective, we've been using the same
3326000	3329000	sound card for OLR since 2002.
3329000	3333000	We moved the sound card from computer to computer.
3333000	3334000	My old laptop had all that too.
3334000	3339000	That's actually how I used to record BBC Radio 1.
3339000	3340000	I'd record interviews off of that.
3340000	3341000	Nice.
3341000	3342000	Very nice.
3342000	3347000	So yeah Nintendo cross play.
3347000	3350000	No, it's a good thing.
3350000	3353000	And you know who does Nintendo best?
3353000	3354000	Nintendo.
3354000	3357000	So I'm looking forward to seeing what they do with this.
3357000	3361000	And I think Smash Brothers seems like the obvious candidate.
3361000	3364000	What's going to be that synergy between the 3DS and the Wii U version that we don't know
3364000	3365000	about yet.
3365000	3367000	There's definitely going to be something there.
3367000	3368000	What is it?
3368000	3369000	Don't know yet.
3369000	3370000	We'll find out.
3370000	3376000	I still, there's that part of me, tin foil hat mode, going a very similar direction to
3376000	3380000	what Loki's saying is that, oh well, soon you're going to be able to play 3DS games
3380000	3381000	on the Wii U.
3381000	3386000	I kind of think, because we got the 2DS this year, which you know, it's a thing.
3386000	3387000	It's a new system.
3387000	3389000	Did I tell you I played one of those this week?
3389000	3390000	I don't think I did.
3390000	3393000	One of my friends has a 2DS and I played the 2DS this week.
3393000	3394000	It feels nice.
3394000	3396000	It has a good ergo to it.
3396000	3397000	Anyway.
3397000	3401000	Next year we ought to be due for some type of new handheld out of Nintendo, right?
3401000	3405000	I mean, even though we don't need one per se, that isn't going to stop them from making
3405000	3406000	one.
3406000	3412000	What if they make some type of 3DS that can double as, wait for it, a Wii U touchpad?
3412000	3416000	Because there's all the outcry out there for, how can I buy a second touchpad?
3416000	3417000	How can I do it?
3417000	3418000	What if the second touchpad is a 3DS?
3418000	3422000	We also need something in the portable consoles that supports the Nintendo network.
3422000	3423000	Why not?
3423000	3424000	Because the 3DS still does friend codes.
3424000	3425000	Ooh.
3425000	3428000	Uh, yes, but at least it's a universal friend code.
3428000	3429000	True.
3429000	3430000	Yeah.
3430000	3432000	I mean, the system's a hell of a lot better than the original DS.
3432000	3436000	It's just the fact that we haven't seen it in a firmware update yet.
3436000	3438000	Obviously we still can in the next year.
3438000	3443000	But especially for Smash Brothers and what they want to continue to do down the road,
3443000	3447000	their portable system needs to come in line and start supporting these same things that
3447000	3448000	the Wii U does.
3448000	3452000	Code Man in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, Rob, is the screens too small?
3452000	3453000	It doesn't have to be.
3453000	3457000	And I'm not saying they're going to make this giant 3DS that's as big as one of those touchpads.
3457000	3458000	What has to be the same?
3458000	3461000	The resolution has to be the same, not the size.
3462000	3465000	So it's very possible that that could happen.
3465000	3468000	I'm tinfoil-hatting and making shit up, admittedly.
3468000	3469000	Why not?
3469000	3473000	It's rumor week on OLR because it's that week in gaming news, so there you go.
3473000	3475000	It's rumor week.
3475000	3476000	That's right, rumors.
3476000	3480000	Some other podcasters in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com with some advice for people
3480000	3482000	that are going to get screwed with the Skype changes.
3482000	3487000	Rama says, use a USB mixer and audition for podcasting.
3487000	3489000	Black Wolf says, I use two sound cards.
3489000	3491000	So there's other ways to do it.
3491000	3494000	Alrighty, let's move on with some more news.
3494000	3495000	DarkSakura.
3495000	3502000	Well, in other news, there is a day one patch for the PS4 that's 300 megabytes and it's
3502000	3504000	adding some interesting things.
3504000	3515000	It's going to add in the remote play, which means that the titles will be displayed on
3515000	3518000	the TV and you can use the Vita to connect to them.
3518000	3521000	The second screen, basically, the Vita.
3521000	3527000	You can record, take screenshots, upload different videos that you've taken.
3527000	3531000	You can watch other people play games.
3531000	3532000	You need Twitch mode.
3532000	3535000	You can play as you download.
3535000	3537000	You have multiple logins up to four people.
3537000	3541000	Voice chat, you have facial recognition and voice commands.
3541000	3543000	This is if you have the camera.
3544000	3548000	Background music player, online multiplayer and the Blu Ray and DVD player.
3548000	3551000	So they're basically going, oops, all this stuff.
3551000	3552000	Here you go.
3552000	3558000	So, I mean, I see no reason to be upset about that, except that, you know, I mean, 300 megabytes
3558000	3560000	isn't really that big.
3560000	3562000	It's just basically saying, oh, we have this functionality.
3562000	3563000	Now we're unlocking it.
3563000	3564000	There you go.
3564000	3565000	Have fun.
3565000	3566000	Party.
3566000	3567000	Literally.
3567000	3569000	Because we have party mode.
3569000	3571000	You can talk to your friends and call them assholes.
3571000	3575000	The only thing I see a problem with it is just the whole Blu Ray DVD playback thing
3575000	3576000	in there.
3576000	3577000	That's my only thing.
3577000	3581000	Because if you don't have any internet and you weren't ever planning on playing on the
3581000	3586000	internet, all the other features like, you know, streaming video and doing all that stuff,
3586000	3591000	you probably don't give a shit about because who cares if I can download a title and play
3591000	3592000	part of the way.
3592000	3595000	I don't have internet, so it doesn't matter to me.
3595000	3598000	So that's the only thing that's kind of lame about that.
3598000	3604000	But yeah, a lot of people nowadays have internet, so they could probably download it one way
3604000	3605000	or another.
3605000	3611000	As long as I think, as long as they support, like, being able to download that off of a
3611000	3614000	storage device or something like that, so you can go to your friend's house, download
3614000	3618000	it onto a USB stick and pop it into your PS4 or something like that, like you can right
3618000	3623000	now with the PlayStation 3, then that might not be so bad if someone doesn't actually
3623000	3626000	have internet, then they could just go somewhere else and get it.
3626000	3631000	But, you know, if it's like the Xbox 360 or something, you know, usually you can't do that.
3631000	3633000	You have to burn a disc or something.
3633000	3637000	There is a part of me, sorry, Jamie, there is a part of me that wonders like, well, those
3637000	3640000	poor people that are going to buy this system mostly for the Blu-ray playback are going
3640000	3643000	to get screwed because, you know, they can't connect to the internet.
3643000	3646000	But then I go, well, wait a minute, when those people just get a PlayStation 3 because they're
3646000	3650000	still on the market and they're going to be cheaper, like these early adopters, I've got
3650000	3652000	to be techie people in the first place, right?
3652000	3653000	Yeah.
3653000	3658000	I mean, I don't think this news is super bad or, you know, it's, unfortunately, it's not
3658000	3659000	out of character at this day and age.
3659000	3663000	And let's, you know, to be fair, at least the update's a lot smaller than the Wii U
3663000	3664000	one, 300 megs.
3664000	3669000	I mean, fuck, that's half the size of the DLC for, you know, Saints Row IV and you're
3669000	3671000	getting way more replay value out of that.
3671000	3674000	Not to even mention that there are cheaper Blu-ray players on a PS3 nowadays.
3674000	3676000	That's very true.
3676000	3680000	It's kind of funny, the direction that we're going soon, Geek Squad is going to start having
3680000	3687000	console, console, console installation, professional services for, oh, your system doesn't turn
3687000	3689000	on and plug in and press play.
3689000	3691000	Now we have to get all this stuff set up upfront.
3691000	3692000	Jason, I'm sure they already do that.
3692000	3696000	Like if you were to ask them those types of questions at Best Buy, like, you know, how
3696000	3700000	could I switch between my Xbox and my PlayStation or whatever, I'm sure Geek Squad will be happy
3700000	3702000	to come out there and hook it all up for you.
3702000	3707000	I always have to wave off that stupid $3 disc insurance thing whenever I buy a game.
3707000	3712000	Or grandma, you know, I want to set up Netflix on the Wii for my kid and they literally don't
3712000	3716000	know how to do it because, you know, I could see where there's a small market for that.
3716000	3719000	Yeah, Ranma says they do that now.
3719000	3720000	I had a feeling.
3720000	3723000	But there's a few other things with this.
3723000	3728000	One thing that will not be available at launch is the suspend resume mode that's supposed to
3728000	3732000	basically use the low power state and take you back into your game, but they said there's
3732000	3734000	more to come on that in the future.
3734000	3739000	There's also a PlayStation app that's going to be out on November 13th in North America
3739000	3742000	and the 22nd of November in Europe.
3742000	3747000	Can we at least have it where when people are talking, especially companies are talking
3747000	3750000	about features that they're going to have in their system, that they fucking come out with
3750000	3755000	the goddamn system and say, yeah, we're going to have this really cool low power mode that's
3755000	3756000	really awesome.
3756000	3757000	Oh, fuck it.
3757000	3758000	It's not coming out at launch.
3758000	3761000	Oh, hey, we're going to have this Internet browser with this brand new up.
3761000	3762000	No, fuck it.
3762000	3763000	It's not going to be ready.
3763000	3769000	You know, seriously, don't advertise features you're not going to fucking have day one.
3769000	3770000	That's it.
3770000	3771000	I mean, it's just like, hey, I bought this car.
3771000	3774000	I heard all these great things about the wheels it has.
3774000	3775000	Oh, fuck.
3775000	3776000	It doesn't have wheels.
3776000	3777000	Damn.
3777000	3779000	No, we can't have that.
3779000	3783000	And we will continue to not have that for the foreseeable decades.
3783000	3788000	I, you know, without evolving on yet another tangent, this is one of those things that
3788000	3793680	there's very much an argument to, um, the success of valve in the sense that they don't
3793680	3796320	tout everything until it's there.
3796320	3798680	Valve has not said a word about half-life three.
3798680	3801260	We know nothing of what half-life three will be.
3801260	3805680	If and when it finally gets here, it's, you know, there's no, there's no expectations
3805680	3808680	other than it's gotta be better than the second game and there's a good chance that that's
3808680	3809680	going to happen.
3809680	3811760	Is valve a publicly traded company?
3811760	3815340	That was going to be my second argument is that no valve is valve is not publicly held.
3815340	3817160	That's why valve can do what they're doing.
3817160	3818160	Yeah.
3818160	3819160	That's, that's absolutely true.
3819160	3823200	If you don't, if you don't meet your investors' earnings, if you don't, you know, pump up
3823200	3827680	your pump, uh, pump your ego in your product for investors, your stock goes down and takes
3827680	3829680	everything else of your value with it.
3829680	3835040	Um, it's all, it's, it's a really, really tangled web because at the same time, more
3835040	3839440	often than not company stocks sync during news announcements, or at least maybe the
3839440	3844400	most popular ones like Amazon, Apple, and possibly also Microsoft.
3844560	3851120	Um, but that's not an uncommon trend, which seems to say, why do we even bother going
3851120	3856400	through this media hype only to have bad news once we get to the end of it?
3858400	3859400	All right.
3859400	3861400	Well, is that it, Darsana, or do you have more?
3861400	3866960	No, I actually had more to say about the app, but, um, yeah, I didn't get it out.
3866960	3867960	It's tangenty tonight.
3867960	3868960	Yeah, I know.
3868960	3873800	Um, the app itself, what it's supposed to do is it lets you access the PlayStation network,
3874320	3878160	your friends list, your trophies, but it also has to act as a second screen for games that
3878160	3879320	support it.
3879320	3882280	So I wanted to get that out.
3882280	3883280	Awesome.
3883280	3884560	For people who don't know.
3884560	3888060	I just hope the servers don't all get hammered the first day and the damn thing takes forever
3888060	3889060	to download.
3889060	3890060	Like what happened on Wii U.
3890060	3891060	Are you being prophetic?
3891060	3892640	Well, just saying they will.
3892640	3893640	I'm sure they will.
3893640	3894640	You just jinxed them, Rob.
3894640	3895640	Thank you.
3895640	3896640	Thanks, Rob.
3896640	3899700	This is no, this is, this is like one of the first rules of the internet is this stuff
3899700	3900700	always happens.
3900700	3901700	Here you go.
3901700	3902700	Here you go.
3902700	3903700	Here's here.
3903700	3906260	If you catch now on their website, download it to the fucking thumb drive.
3906260	3907260	Thank you.
3907260	3908260	Thank you.
3908260	3909260	That would be a great idea.
3909260	3910260	Actually.
3910260	3913220	It's like, Hey, we know our servers are probably gonna get hammered at launch.
3913220	3917860	Hey, you want to take, you want to be a little bit, a bit torrent, put a bit torrent out
3917860	3918860	there.
3918860	3925020	Then they, then it won't even be on their servers, but I guess that's, yeah, I'm just
3925020	3932220	saying, I'm just, you, you could, that's a little too controversial for them, but then
3932220	3936180	hackers would tear that shit apart if they're going to tear it apart anyways, what are they
3936180	3937180	going to do with it?
3937180	3941180	It's just going to take them five minutes longer, figure out that much faster, how to
3941180	3942700	install Linux on it.
3942700	3949500	I guess they've already done it to the toaster, so don't get me started to register participation
3949500	3952580	for this week's episode of orange launch radio at vog network.com.
3952580	3958780	Use the passphrase saw, um, okay.
3958780	3962660	So a little bit more about the PlayStation for, um, there was some details coming out
3962660	3967580	about the digital games and some of the benefits you get with PlayStation plus, for example,
3967580	3972740	digital games, you can actually share your account with a couple, two consoles.
3972740	3976820	So you have one console that you deem your primary console that kind of operates the
3976820	3981620	way I see is similar to like, um, I think how your PlayStation three works right now,
3981620	3986760	where you download stuff to it and it will play with, you know, pretty much anybody that's
3986760	3990800	logged in will have access to that DLC or the game or whatever.
3990800	3997040	Um, also, um, remote play will be available through the Vita and you'll be able to, I
3997040	4001240	guess, purchase and preorder content via the PlayStation app for that console and that
4001240	4002240	type of stuff.
4002240	4006240	You can also, um, use two systems concurrently.
4006240	4012360	So the system activated is your primary PS4 and one other system that you're logged into.
4012360	4019200	So that to me sounds like if I get grand theft out of five for the PlayStation four
4019200	4026440	or something like that or whatever, and I have the digital download for like, you know,
4026440	4031680	I downloaded to my system and then I have a second PS4, my friend has a PS4 and I log
4031680	4038080	into their system that I can play two players with the same game or is they only gonna allow
4038080	4039480	one person to play at a time?
4039480	4040480	It doesn't really specify.
4040480	4045400	I think it's very, that what the Xbox 360 does right now is almost the exact same rules,
4045400	4048320	sort of locally, not across systems.
4048320	4051280	If everybody's in the same household, you can have those, those guests accounts, which
4051280	4054580	are the same gamer tag with the one, two, three appended to it.
4054580	4057680	I think that's what you're thinking of, but certainly not across two consoles in different
4057680	4058680	locations.
4058680	4062040	No, it sounds like, well, I mean, it sounds similar to what I think.
4062040	4064880	Didn't you guys have to do something like that with Mass Effect or something where you'd
4064880	4069600	play on one console and log in, you know, with the other person's thing.
4069600	4071000	I don't know.
4071000	4076720	They've kind of done this right now, I wanna say with, cause remember they used to have
4076720	4082640	it where you could authorize like a few accounts and the whole thing, or a few different systems
4082640	4089640	to use your data, your DLC or whatever with, just because, you know, oh well, what if,
4089640	4092860	you know, my system crashes and I need a new system and I need to authorize it so they
4092860	4093860	have the file.
4093860	4100860	And you would have actually, um, people exploiting that to, okay, I buy a copy of a game and
4100860	4102740	I'm gonna share it with four of my friends.
4102740	4108140	So they started limiting that down to, I think now it's down to two and I think that's what
4108140	4109140	they have here.
4109140	4112180	So you could exploit that, but I don't think it's meant for that.
4112180	4115140	It's more of like, you know, I'm going to my friend's house or something.
4115140	4116140	Yeah.
4116140	4118280	It's more like you are going to go to your friends and play one game, but your little
4118280	4120860	brother is still at home playing your PlayStation four.
4120860	4123140	Like it's more like that kind of situation, right?
4123140	4124140	I think so.
4124140	4125140	Two is pretty reasonable.
4125140	4126140	Yeah.
4126140	4128140	I think that's how it's supposed to be.
4128140	4129660	Uh, oh, here we go.
4129660	4138040	It says, uh, let's see, cause they have like an infographic for it and it says only, only
4138040	4140300	you can start games you download.
4140300	4145740	Only you can enjoy benefits from PlayStation plus and then, uh, systems that are not activated
4145740	4146860	as your primary.
4146860	4150620	And then, uh, that graphic is clear as bud.
4150620	4151620	Yeah.
4151820	4154140	I don't understand what the fuck they're talking about.
4154140	4156660	A system that is activated is primary.
4156660	4159980	Uh, yeah, you, you have, don't get it.
4159980	4162180	I think that's, yeah, I think I had it right.
4162180	4163180	You had it right.
4163180	4167260	You can, you with your account, with your PlayStation network account can download things
4167260	4168400	to the console.
4168400	4172900	As soon as it's on the console, anybody else can take advantage of that locally.
4172900	4176100	Nobody else can start a download using your account.
4176100	4178300	It's it's, it's pretty expected.
4178300	4184660	Uh, some other random details that were, um, released, I guess that the PlayStation four
4184660	4188380	and Xbox one both support up to eight people in party chat.
4188380	4189380	Now here's my questions.
4189380	4192140	How many does the Xbox three 60 support now in party chat?
4192140	4194100	Because I think it's quite a few people.
4194100	4195100	I think eight.
4195100	4196100	You think six?
4196100	4197100	I thought it was only six.
4197100	4202320	I seem to remember it's a full game limited to four plus just two more could be wrong.
4202320	4206940	It's been forever since I've used that because I don't know, because I know I've had a lot
4206940	4210640	of people in party chat before, but I don't remember.
4210640	4211640	I haven't really counted.
4211640	4214640	There's no, it worked.
4214640	4216860	So it'd be interesting.
4216860	4219060	Hopefully it's the same or more, you know?
4219060	4220060	Um, yeah.
4220060	4224680	And he said, party voice chat will support eight players like on places where like from
4224680	4228620	support that xbox.com a party can contain up to eight people.
4228620	4231940	Once the maximum attendance is reached, someone must leave the party before another person
4231940	4234160	can join.
4234160	4236500	That's the GTFO our party right now.
4236500	4239380	We want someone cool.
4239380	4240540	Get out.
4240540	4241860	We have no cake for you.
4241860	4247020	I was gonna say like eight seems right because like, isn't like a Forza horizon match, like
4247020	4251140	eight people and like a lot of xbox live stuff is like eight people I think.
4251140	4252140	So anyway.
4252140	4254100	All right.
4254100	4255100	That's it.
4255100	4256100	All right.
4256100	4261860	Well, moving on to some more news, uh, news about a game called bravely default for the
4261860	4262860	sequel.
4262860	4268820	Uh, bravely default for the sequel is going to be coming out on the three D S and uh,
4268820	4273820	it's going to have a new system in it known as bravely second, uh, bravely default for
4273820	4278300	the sequel is kind of like a cutesy little like role playing ish type of game.
4278300	4283500	Um, bravely second will, uh, have, you know, time stopping antics, which, you know, we're
4283500	4288660	in the original game, uh, but it relies on what's called SP your special power.
4288660	4291940	Uh, once you use this power, your SP decreases.
4291940	4296780	You can gain SP when you put your three D S and sleep mode, but it's a little bit slow.
4296780	4298420	It's like regening Nana and ever quest.
4298420	4299780	It's very, very slow.
4299780	4303580	One SP point is added for every eight hours of idle time.
4303580	4304580	But guess what?
4304580	4310640	If you don't want to wait, you can buy potions on the three D S E shop that refill your SP.
4310640	4313940	I've seen that model before on a Facebook game.
4313940	4314940	Yuck.
4314940	4321300	Well, we keep telling them they need to learn the internet, so we're better to turn to not
4321300	4322300	the place to do.
4322300	4324980	I don't think this is actually a Nintendo game.
4324980	4332020	However, um, we don't know, uh, producer Tomoya as Sano, uh, assures fans that this will be
4332020	4333020	a good thing.
4333020	4334020	Oh, of course.
4334020	4339060	Quote, bravely second, isn't a demerit, but a system that gives players an advantage.
4339060	4341340	It's convenient and it's very powerful.
4341340	4344480	So in other words, it's for people that want to cheat, I guess is what I'm reading in that.
4344520	4347960	And so if you want to like, you can buy cheats essentially.
4347960	4350400	This game is out in Japan in December.
4350400	4353840	Um, I don't know if it's coming out here.
4353840	4358280	I haven't heard anything about it.
4358280	4362920	I'm trying to see bravely default Western release includes updated for the sequel.
4362920	4366320	We had the, we had the first one.
4366320	4368520	So bravery default.
4368520	4372160	I'm switching my internal clock to make it look like it's a day later.
4372160	4373840	Oh, look, there's all my energy back.
4373840	4374840	Yeah.
4374840	4378040	I wonder if people would be able to time travel and trick the trick, the thing that way.
4378040	4381280	Another article on the site says that it's going to be out in North America in 2014.
4381280	4384760	Oh, thank you.
4384760	4385760	I didn't play the first one.
4385760	4389040	I gotta be honest, but I did hear about it and you know, some people seem to enjoy it.
4389040	4396700	So I really hope that this is something that truly, not just cause the dude says it is
4396700	4400200	truly is not like has no impact on the game.
4400200	4404340	If I were to not use it, like in other words, I could still beat the game start to finish
4404340	4407520	without too much hassle without even touching this stuff.
4407520	4410000	Cause that would just be, that would just be shitty.
4410000	4411620	I don't really have another word for it.
4411620	4416820	One point for every eight hours though, on any scale of any RPG I've ever played, that's,
4416820	4418800	that's ludicrously small.
4418800	4422220	And like you would, you know, let, let's assume something's 15 points.
4422220	4424920	That's what, four days of idle before you recharge that.
4424920	4425920	It's ridiculous.
4425920	4430180	Shane's telling me we haven't had the first one, but I'm looking at it right here on Amazon
4430180	4434120	for sale or is this an import Japanese?
4434120	4437440	I got fooled has a really pretty art.
4437440	4442360	So you know, somebody that imported it and I guess so as if there's not plenty of people
4442360	4447400	around this table, that's ever done something like that for a game before 2d X.
4447400	4448400	All right.
4448400	4450200	Uh, let's move on before we get to release date.
4450200	4451200	Start Sakura.
4451200	4455280	Um, we have, uh, remember last week we talked about, was it last week?
4455280	4459000	I think that, um, Nintendo wasn't going to be making Wii for Japan anymore.
4459780	4460780	This is Wii, not the Wii U.
4460780	4464100	Well, it's already been confirmed as well for Europe.
4464100	4469980	Um, they are going to be producing no more for the European markets and, um, Nintendo
4469980	4476220	of UK said that the consumers who don't own a Wii can still buy a Wii mini.
4476220	4479540	That's the lower price point that has a bunch of the stuff missing.
4479540	4488980	Um, it's all using a DLC, sorry, it's only disc based games and no deals, uh, no download
4488980	4491760	titles and no backwards compatibility.
4491760	4495480	Um, but, uh, no word for the U S yet.
4495480	4497200	There was a second body type for the Wii.
4497200	4499160	Yeah, it was the Wii mini.
4499160	4500160	It was crap.
4500160	4504960	It, there is no internet connection cause it doesn't have a wifi, anything in it.
4504960	4507480	There was no HD out on it.
4507480	4512360	Um, and it's funny cause it has all these channels and stuff on there, but you can't
4512360	4514600	really do anything with it because there's no internet.
4514600	4515600	You can't download the virtual console stuff.
4515600	4518320	Yeah, they shut off all the, a lot of the channels now.
4518320	4519320	Yeah.
4519320	4520320	Did that actually come out stateside?
4520320	4522320	No GameCube backwards compatibility in Canada.
4522320	4523900	I don't know if the mini ever did, Canada.
4523900	4527420	Canada got the red one, of course, but, uh, I don't think it ever came out in the U S.
4527420	4529100	I missed all of this news.
4529100	4530100	It's just crap.
4530100	4534460	Just, I mean, seriously, if you're going to save money on a Wii, buy a used Wii.
4534460	4539020	It's you know, why bother wasting money on a brand new piece of shit that doesn't do
4539020	4540020	anything?
4540020	4541460	I don't know.
4541460	4545580	The Wii does have a huge game library though for people that, you know, might want to get
4545580	4547300	one for a younger person.
4547300	4550360	You know, entry level gaming console or whatever.
4550360	4554320	And really the Wii was only a good for me for one thing and that was, you know, weather
4554320	4560400	and we news and I can't do that anymore because the news channel doesn't work.
4560400	4564280	I checked that every, no it's funny that you mentioned that because I kind of liked those
4564280	4566120	channels for a very long time.
4566120	4570480	There's always something wrong with the news channel and uh, yeah, I don't know.
4570480	4573760	I found easier source, Oh no, I know what happened.
4573760	4579740	I found an iPhone and then having to go back to a console on my TV was not exactly as important
4579740	4580740	or convenient anymore.
4580740	4584900	I just can't believe that I waited in line for that, except that I hung out with Kristen
4584900	4587100	the whole time and it was pretty fun and we got donuts.
4587100	4592460	It was alright in the beginning, I don't know, Excite Truck was awesome.
4592460	4595020	You're still mad about Excite Bots.
4595020	4597980	I am furious about Excite Bots.
4597980	4603260	Seriously, who in the, who on the face of the earth thought, hey let's put a mini game
4603260	4606080	in the middle of a fucking race and that's a great idea.
4606080	4608360	I don't want to punch them in the goddamn face.
4608360	4612020	Like for some reason it's become like a trend on Twitter lately to really hate on the Twilight
4612020	4616760	Princess as part of the Zelda series, but I mean that game was like the shit when it
4616760	4618960	first came out on the Nintendo Wii.
4618960	4624580	I mean just kind of what it, what it did and then I named my cat after and kind of like,
4624580	4627360	you know what that brought to the table for gaming in general.
4627360	4632020	Um, so I guess, you know, now if you go back and play it now, it's a little bit like, Oh,
4632020	4636040	this is very linear, but I mean it was great at the time.
4636040	4638600	Yeah, the Wii, the Wii brought a lot of great games.
4638600	4639600	Come on.
4639600	4640600	All right, let's move on.
4640600	4644040	We've got to travel around the world and check out some release dates and what's coming out
4644040	4645960	near you soon.
4645960	4647500	Yes.
4647500	4652140	So this week, uh, actually a lot of games, but in no particular order here, Monster High
4652140	4658600	13 Wishes for girls on the Wii, Wii U, 3DS and DS.
4659400	4665620	They're also doing some collections of games, X-Com and Civ 5, the 2K definitive strategy
4665620	4673140	collection on PC, Sonic Lost World on 3DS and Wii U, Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures,
4673140	4679240	the game that sort of resembles some of the 3D Sonic games and based on some new animated
4679240	4687220	TV series, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii and Wii U and 3DS I believe.
4687220	4692340	The game stick is finally coming out and no one cared.
4692340	4698280	The 2K power pack collection with Darkness 2, I think it, actually that might be the
4698280	4708020	first Darkness, the Darkness Mafia 2 and Bioshock, I have to make sure here, I can't read this.
4708020	4716140	Oh, Bioshock 2 Darkness 2 and Mafia 2, those are coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
4716140	4723540	Battlefield 4 on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and PC this week.
4723540	4731580	Angry Birds Star Wars on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, Wii U, 3DS and Vita.
4731580	4738540	Beyblade Evolution on 3DS, Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360,
4738540	4745900	Wii U and actually no PC, that's coming out later because we can't get their release dates
4745900	4748220	coordinated for the PC versions.
4748220	4753940	WWE 2K14 on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
4753940	4759660	What else here?
4759660	4765540	Transformers Ultimate Battle Edition re-release there, also Ultimate Autobots Edition and
4765540	4775380	there's one last one here, more Angry Birds, Doodle Jump for 3DS.
4775900	4781340	Yeah, 3DS and DS, Doodle Jump.
4781340	4791620	And then, oh, also I think on Friday, I think that's the first, Wii Remote, they're gonna
4791620	4798540	have a Wii Remote Plus for Luigi and Mario, you know, cause that's cool and all.
4798540	4805000	I wanted to add, this is kind of funny, cause I don't know if they even talk next gen release
4805000	4812000	dates yet, but Call of Duty Ghosts on all formats will be coming out on the 5th.
4812000	4817320	That's right, you can get Call of Duty Ghosts two weeks before the system that comes out
4817320	4820040	to play it on the Xbox One.
4820040	4821240	Doesn't this happen all the time?
4821240	4825960	No, it happens a few days, like, you know, it comes out on Friday and it releases on...
4825960	4828720	So when the Wii U came out, all the games were on shelves earlier, I remember that.
4828720	4834120	Yeah, they were out like, you know, maybe a few days before the system came out, maybe
4834120	4835400	a week.
4835400	4838200	But this is like two weeks, this is fucking stupid.
4838200	4839200	I gotcha.
4839200	4842520	Alright, let's take a look at Japan and what's coming out in Japan.
4842520	4845760	They're getting their releases on Halloween the 31st.
4845760	4850560	The FPS Pad 3 Strike Gear, I think that's actually an accessory, sorry that's not a
4850560	4851560	game.
4851560	4856040	But you can get a Mahjong game called Dankyu Battle 3, comes out this week on the Playstation
4856040	4857040	3.
4857040	4862520	Next to Tiara 2, Hau no Matsue comes out in a first print limited edition, if you're
4862520	4863620	so inclined.
4863620	4868400	And then Vampire Resurrection, just in time for Halloween, gets a price reduction.
4868400	4870040	So there you go on the Playstation 3.
4870040	4873040	On the Xbox 360, there is really nothing this week.
4873040	4879640	You can get that same little FPS Pad thing I talked about before, that's really it.
4879640	4883120	On the Playstation Vita this week, Gundam Breaker!
4883160	4887640	And there is also a new Slim model, because I believe those Vita Slims, those just came
4887640	4891520	out in Japan like a couple weeks ago, or one of them, right?
4891520	4895380	There's a Gundam Breaker Vita pack, if you're so inclined, so that's out.
4895380	4902720	Also Chuu Jiji-Gen GEMU Neptune Rebirth 1, in regular and limited edition, is out on
4902720	4904960	the Vita as well.
4904960	4910360	On the Wii U this week, yes there is some Wii U stuff in Japan this week, Wii Party
4910360	4912960	U is one of the big games coming out.
4912960	4920280	And then there's some stuff that's centered around, it looks like Wii Fit U, but is that
4920280	4922080	available for download on the 31st?
4922080	4924680	I don't remember how that whole thing was going down, like remember you could like download
4924680	4925680	it a month early or something?
4925680	4929520	Yeah, you're supposed to be able to download it a month early, and I know that next, not
4929520	4936000	next week, but the week after next, those stupid Wii Fit sensor things are supposed
4936000	4937000	to go on sale.
4937000	4941200	Because in Japan, you've got the Fit Meter is out this week, and the Balance Board covers
4941200	4946640	are out this week, so I'm like, there's a lot of activity around Wii Fit coming out
4946640	4947640	this week.
4947640	4952200	In fact, it looks like there's actually a Wii U set that comes with Wii Fit U that they're
4952200	4953200	releasing in Japan.
4953200	4954200	I'm trying to bring this up right now.
4954200	4959380	Oh yeah, looks like there's a new bundle in Japan that's 32 gigs, black Wii U, with Mario
4959380	4965920	Brothers U, Wii Party U, Wii Fit U, a Wii Mote, and the whole little like sensor bar
4965920	4972400	thing, and it comes with one of the little portable, what are those called, the sensors?
4972400	4977220	They look like Tamagotchis, for God's sake, they're little Wii U Tamagotchis, but it's
4977220	4978220	you.
4978220	4980440	That's straight up the pocket station right there.
4980440	4981440	Right?
4981440	4984680	So they've got a hefty little bundle there in Japan out this week.
4984680	4994800	So alright, let's see, also moving on to the Nintendo 3DS, Dan Ball Senki Wars is out this
4994800	5003000	week, and Chara Petsukute Sonatete, character Shogaku, comes out this week.
5003000	5008960	And that's just cute little animals including a pink panda who has hearts for ears.
5008960	5011160	Aw, that's adorable.
5011160	5012160	That's it for Japanese releases.
5012160	5013920	How about the UK darts, Sakura?
5013920	5022080	In the UK, we have on the 29th of October, WWE K14, on the 31st, Football Manager 2014
5022080	5029080	for PC and Mac, and Tokitori, excuse me, on November 1st, there's Angry Birds Star
5029080	5034160	Wars for damn near everything, and Angry Birds Star Wars 2 for damn near every console, Assassin's
5034160	5044000	Creed 4 Black Flag, Battlefield 4, Blur Overdrive for iPad and iPhone, and Wii Fit U.
5044000	5047160	That sounds kind of dirty.
5047160	5049000	I don't want to know about that anymore.
5049000	5050000	I'm done.
5050000	5054000	Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys, and then the classic game of the week,
5054000	5055400	but first, Loki.
5055400	5062480	Alright, so there's going to be a brand new Mario themed, I guess, deluxe bundle that's
5062480	5064400	going to be coming out for the Wii U.
5064400	5068840	Instead of Nintendo landing in there, they're kind of updating the whole skew with now New
5068840	5074560	Super Mario Brothers U and the DLC New Luigi, or New Super Luigi U, so you'll be able to
5074560	5083600	get that for $2.99 this holiday, starting, I believe, at the end of next week, so it'll
5083600	5084600	be pretty fast.
5084600	5092920	And then also, even though it is leaving shelves in a couple other regions, the Wii will still
5092920	5100720	be around in the US, and basically the announcement of the Wii console being discontinued is specific
5100720	5103320	to Japan, and well, now Europe.
5103320	5107300	There's no change of status in the Wii in the United States, and is available for purchase
5107300	5108920	this holiday season.
5108920	5114840	Of course, you know, gotta clear out those shelves, because they probably still stock
5114840	5115840	over here.
5115840	5117840	Yeah, that's right.
5117840	5123680	Alright, in some other bundle related news, this is something that's happening in Japan,
5123680	5128800	but Metal Gear Rising will be getting like a Playstation 3 special edition.
5129600	5134280	It's a DLC bundled Playstation 3 re-release that's going to come out later this year for
5134280	5138560	Metal Gear Rising, and it's the Re-Vengeance special edition.
5138560	5145340	It will have Blade Wolf and Jetstream DLC packs, 30 VR missions, 5 alternate costumes,
5145340	5148480	and a custom Playstation 3 theme.
5148480	5153680	You can check all that out on December 5th, and it's also going to be available as a download
5153680	5157220	on Playstation Network, as most of the game releases are.
5157220	5159280	Don't know yet if this is coming out stateside.
5159280	5162240	This is only confirmed for Japan as of right now.
5162240	5164260	Speaking of Playstation, I have another quick story.
5164260	5169460	This is about a whole little Playstation bundle.
5169460	5170460	This is interesting.
5170460	5175900	A Gran Turismo 6 bundle that's going to come out in Brazil.
5175900	5180340	It's an, I'm going to mispronounce this name, and I apologize because he passed away in
5180340	5183460	1994, but he was a very famous racer.
5183460	5188380	Ayrton Senna, I hope I didn't mispronounce that, I apologize if I did, but he's going
5188380	5193700	to be featured as part of this Gran Turismo 6 bundle that's coming out, and it's supposed
5193700	5196900	to actually kind of like help charity, which is pretty cool.
5196900	5201900	I'm assuming that part of the proceeds of the bundle actually go to the institute set
5201900	5205980	up in this guy's name that helps to educate, so that's pretty cool.
5205980	5206980	This is on December 6th.
5206980	5208940	This is coming out in Brazil.
5208940	5215180	Comes out with Gran Turismo 6, a 250 gigabyte Playstation 3, and one controller.
5215180	5218340	So that's very cool.
5218340	5221180	One other reason I bring this up is that, I don't know if you guys saw, but apparently
5221180	5224340	the Playstation 4 is going to cost oodles and oodles of money in Brazil.
5224340	5225980	Did you hear about that?
5225980	5226980	It's something like...
5226980	5228220	It kind of doesn't surprise me though.
5228220	5229700	Yeah, everything costs more over there.
5229700	5234940	Yeah, I know, but it's like on the scale of like $1500 or something like that when you
5234940	5236500	convert the money.
5236500	5242660	It's a really high price, so I bet there will be people that just somehow get one from the
5242660	5245780	US or another place and import them for way less.
5245780	5248540	But it's taxes is what the thing is.
5248540	5251500	Taxes that really affect the prices, not that they're marketing it up.
5251500	5253500	People will get them illegally.
5253500	5259900	Alright, let's travel back to a time when Gran Turismo 5 wasn't even out.
5259900	5262580	Heck, I don't even think the original Gran Turismo was out.
5262940	5266780	In fact, some people would still agree that Gran Turismo 5 is not out yet.
5266780	5268660	That's the joke I was trying to make unsuccessfully.
5268660	5272820	But it's time for Dark Sakura to step into the gaming vault and find a game that she
5272820	5277300	thinks, hey, you should like play this now and stuff.
5277300	5278420	You're going to roll your eyes.
5278420	5280780	I'm totally going to roll my eyes at this week's...
5280780	5284220	But I did it for you and I did it for Shane.
5284220	5285220	Don't do anything for Shane.
5285220	5286220	That was the first mistake.
5286220	5288740	I am doing something for Shane so that he will help me level.
5288740	5290140	You're only making him stronger.
5290140	5291140	That's right.
5291140	5293060	Shane is horrible power stronger.
5293060	5294940	Shane, don't listen to them.
5294940	5296940	You have good taste in music.
5296940	5300500	Alright, Dark Sakura, what is the classic game of the week?
5300500	5303700	It's Pokemon Red and Blue.
5303700	5304700	Don't laugh.
5304700	5305700	These aren't classic.
5305700	5306700	Don't judge me.
5306700	5309340	You're totally judging me right now.
5309340	5311460	Maybe a little bit.
5311460	5320440	Anyway, so anyway, this was developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo for the Game
5320440	5324960	Boy and this came out in 1996.
5324960	5330680	Actually in Japan they came out as Red and Green and Blue was released as a special edition.
5330680	5334400	Then they were released as Red and Blue in North America, Europe and Australia over the
5334400	5335400	next three years.
5335400	5341400	Pokemon Yellow is a special version that was basically like, hi, here's Pikachu.
5341400	5348040	Both have been remade, by the way, as Pokemon FireRed and LeafGreen that came out in 2004.
5348040	5353280	So basically, overhead perspective, you go through the fictional area of Kanto and you
5353280	5357080	basically abuse your poor little animals and make Pita cry.
5357080	5360200	I'm kidding because that was a fake.
5360200	5366680	But you basically pit your animals against each other and see who is the greatest.
5366680	5372980	Of course, you know, I love how in Japan the game was more marketed as with the adventure
5372980	5373980	and everything.
5373980	5377320	And yeah, the collection thing was a part of it, but it's like blatant commercialism
5377320	5378320	out here.
5378320	5379320	Gotta catch them all!
5379320	5380320	Like rabies or something.
5380320	5381320	I don't know.
5381320	5386000	So anyway, you have to fight the different gym leaders and you collect badges and you
5386000	5390320	beat the game like a bat.
5390320	5396560	So, other things about this game is that you have a little thing in there called the Pokedex.
5396560	5402560	And basically for the first game you had 150 available Pokemon and you could keep track
5402560	5407960	of all of them that you catch in your Pokedex and you still had to deal with Team Rocket.
5407960	5412600	You could also use your game link cable to connect your games together and let you trade
5412600	5416040	and battle between games, which my husband and I did quite a bit.
5416040	5419840	I believe Dan played Red and I played Blue.
5419840	5428200	Then there was the 151st Pokemon Mew that you could only get through official distribution
5428200	5435400	by Nintendo or by a glitch and I won't say anything about getting it that way cause I
5435400	5436400	got it.
5436400	5438680	And Nintendo please come to your house right now.
5438680	5442440	Whatever, they're a little late.
5442440	5448240	So yeah, basically IGN ranked it as one of the top 100 games of all time.
5448240	5452300	And in 2009 it was in the Guinness Book of World Records as best selling RPG on Game
5452300	5455520	Boy and best selling RPG on Time.
5455600	5461080	So basically you have the third person overhead view but when you're in your battles it switches
5461080	5467040	to a behind the back of your whatever Pokemon that you're playing and you can train them
5467040	5468040	out.
5468040	5469040	You have up to six.
5469040	5474380	You cannot teach, you know, Pokemon who would, who have wings, you have to teach them how
5474380	5475380	to fly.
5475380	5477420	I mean, really, what's up with that?
5477420	5480600	You get experience, you level them up.
5480600	5487840	You also can get some of the most useless piece of crap Pokemon ever like Magikarp.
5487840	5494000	But Magikarp turns into Gyarados and I have gone through the entire game with Gyarados
5494000	5495400	and I haven't eaten anything else.
5495400	5500840	The first time I got, did that whole wonder trade on Pokemon X and Y, somebody sent me
5500840	5501840	a fucking Magikarp.
5501840	5506040	But of course it was Japanese Magikarp so that made it a little cooler.
5506040	5507040	Mmhmm.
5507040	5508040	Oh Rob.
5508480	5515320	Anyway, as far as other elements in the game, you do also have the capturing aspect, gotta
5515320	5521560	catch them all, where you can find Pokemon in the wild and you can put them into a life
5521560	5525320	of eternal servitude living in little balls for the rest of their existence.
5525320	5527560	They're like little animal genies.
5527560	5528560	Little animal genies.
5528560	5531240	They come out and do cage fighting for you.
5531240	5532240	Yeah.
5532640	5539120	And to also say something about something that was mentioned in the last game, Pikachu
5539120	5540860	is the breed, not it's name.
5540860	5543560	It's like calling your dog, dog.
5543560	5545440	Calling your cat, cat.
5545440	5548360	I had a cat named Mr. Cat, that was a little bit more respectful.
5548360	5550840	It'd be like saying Pikachu son.
5550840	5554640	So anyway, there have been other versions, of course.
5554640	5559440	There were Gold, Silver, and Crystal, that was a second generation.
5559440	5563800	And using the transfer pack on Nintendo 64, you could actually use items from your Red
5563800	5567640	and Blue in Pokemon Stadium and Pokemon Stadium 2.
5567640	5571840	However, they were not compatible with the advanced generation.
5571840	5577240	Which I actually had Pokemon Stadium, but I kind of didn't play it much.
5577240	5580240	Really the best part about Pokemon Stadium was like, just watching your Pokemon come
5580240	5583240	out and do their little poses and then it got boring.
5583240	5586280	I love seeing through.
5586280	5589320	Anyway, I'm looking over the shoulder.
5589320	5593360	So the setting of the game takes place in Kanto.
5593360	5599880	And it's got different habitats for the different Pokemon, different towns and cities, and roots
5599880	5602280	that connect them all to each other.
5602280	5606560	And you can get some of them only by fishing.
5606560	5609760	You can get stuff like the Zubat only in the cave.
5609760	5618160	So you're sent out by Professor Oak, who lets you pick one and then you are in a rivalry
5618160	5620640	with Oak's grandson.
5620640	5625080	And what was his name, Gary?
5625080	5629080	Because I remember the character in Japan was actually named after Miyamoto, his name
5629080	5631120	was Shigeru.
5631120	5638280	So there's also a rumor that we were supposed to get a version of, that there had been an
5638280	5643880	intention to do a version of Green that had a female trainer.
5643880	5646720	But that's still on the rumor mill.
5646720	5650960	Anyway, you can start off with Bulbasaur, Squirtle, or Charmander.
5650960	5653680	And yeah, my first game playthrough is Bulbasaur.
5653680	5657320	Every other time I've ever, you know, I switched to red and was like Charmander all the way
5657320	5659440	because I didn't care.
5659440	5662200	But my first playthrough was with Bulbasaur.
5662200	5669000	And basically you eventually have to fight the Elite Four and the new champion who is
5669000	5670480	boom, your rival.
5670480	5672080	So you have to kick their ass.
5672080	5677600	So the whole concept of Pokemon started, and I don't know how many people know about this,
5677600	5684280	that the designer Satoshi Tajiri was an insect collector.
5684280	5692040	And so basically he wanted to give that same feeling of discovery, of capture, of collection
5692040	5698400	like that, of live specimens into a game that people could play at any time.
5698400	5702160	You wouldn't necessarily have to live out in the country for it.
5702160	5706520	He was noticing that kids played more in their homes instead of outside.
5706520	5711920	So he wanted to sort of give people the feeling of being able to grow up in the outside environment.
5711920	5716320	And like I said, that sense of discovery.
5716320	5721360	He also did not want to make games that had more, as he said, pointless violence, even
5721360	5724000	though he's having animals fight each other.
5724000	5729760	So basically, that was the other one I was trying to remember, is that the character
5729760	5733360	that you play at is named Satoshi after himself.
5733360	5736480	And of course his rival is Shikaru after Miyamoto.
5736480	5747960	So there's so much more about this, a lot of history that went into the production of
5747960	5752440	the game.
5752440	5760680	They even made some different audio advancements by using different sounds in the processor
5760680	5767520	to create a snare sound using basically a white noise filter in the Game Boy, creating
5767520	5775400	the animal sounds by using, the Pokemon sounds by using the, basically making it a very short
5775400	5776400	chiptune.
5776400	5782000	It was supposed to be originally called Capsule Monster, but there was a trademark issue,
5782000	5787360	they were going to call it Capamon, and basically they went to Pocket Monster, so it's Pokemon.
5787360	5794760	And it was basically rejected over and over by Nintendo until Miyamoto came out with the
5794760	5796400	golden way of making it work.
5796400	5798320	So that's why we have it.
5798320	5804800	So that's, I'm not going to go into a lot more of the detail, because really there is
5804800	5813440	a whole hell of a lot about this game, but if you haven't played the original, I think
5813440	5814440	you're kind of missing out.
5814440	5818760	Even if you're not a big fan of Pokemon at all today, if you don't care about the new
5818760	5824400	ones, I think that if anyone wants a good rounded off classic gaming background, Pokemon
5824400	5825520	should be in it.
5825520	5827560	So that's my final word.
5827560	5830920	Alright there it is, your classic game of the week, or games of the week, Pokemon Red
5830920	5831920	and Pokemon Blue.
5831920	5834200	And you can add yellow into it because it was the same gen.
5834200	5838440	I was going to say, my first Pokemon game was yellow, so it was the same gen.
5838440	5844520	I got the see-through off-purple Game Boy color and Pokemon Yellow.
5844520	5848840	Yeah, it was because of the damn anime that I loved Pokemon.
5848840	5853240	You know, I had the Japanese theme song memorized for years, and I actually have, you know how
5853240	5857200	you used to buy singles in those square cases with the little tiny disc inside?
5857200	5859960	I actually have the Nyasu sings.
5859960	5860960	Nice.
5860960	5862760	Nyasu is Meowth.
5862760	5865720	So it also has the full Team Rocket song on it.
5865720	5871280	I squeed in the new Pokemon X and Y when wild Pikachus were showing up in the second zone
5871280	5872280	you're in.
5872280	5875540	I was like, yes, that's the Pokemon I want to capture, you know, that's the right call.
5875540	5880120	And also, just to say, one of Shermie's nicknames was Caterpie.
5880120	5881120	Just saying.
5881120	5884200	It is pretty crazy to think that the games Red and Blue predated the anime.
5884200	5885200	Yeah, I know, right?
5885200	5886200	At least in Japan.
5886200	5887520	I don't remember about America.
5887520	5892720	I think that the games, I think that it was more of a simultaneous thing over here.
5892720	5893720	Yeah, it was more of a simultaneous thing.
5893720	5895160	Because the anime had already been out forever.
5895160	5898840	And for the record, the Porygon episode totally did not make me have a seizure.
5898840	5899840	Just saying.
5899840	5902760	All right, we're going to take a quick break, guys.
5902760	5906680	When we come back, there's plenty more OLR to come, including rapid fire news, more emails.
5906680	5908360	I know we had one at the top of the show.
5908360	5909360	We got more to come.
5909360	5911240	Fugu question of the week and plenty, plenty more.
5911240	5912240	Your calls as well.
5912240	5913240	1-877-GAME-OLR.
5913240	5917180	We'll be back, though, after a quick break with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5917180	5923720	Don't go anywhere.
5923720	5927120	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.
5927120	5931380	Live on this Sunday night with episode number 525 of our show.
5931380	5932380	That's a palindrome.
5932380	5933900	And it's a multiple of 25.
5933900	5936500	So therefore, it's an event episode tonight.
5936500	5937500	Woohoo!
5937500	5942820	Well, it's always an event when the awesome Jason is here with us, as he can't join us
5942820	5943820	all the time.
5943820	5949260	Just in a while, he's in San Francisco for work and drives up the road to come say hi.
5949260	5951940	Because 22 hours to San Francisco in the first place wasn't enough.
5951940	5954260	Had to do the extra two hours up to Sacramento.
5954260	5956980	Do you wave the first time through?
5956980	5964180	I was thinking of making a surprise stop in here because I was ... I don't remember if
5964180	5968300	I was in Sacramento city limits or at least around the downtown area when the show started
5968300	5969900	or if it was just after.
5969900	5973400	And I probably should have, considering that I proceeded to take about four hours because
5973400	5979040	of the traffic in just South Sacramento, plus the traffic in Berkeley, plus the traffic
5979040	5980040	in downtown.
5980040	5981920	You drove in during the BART strike.
5981920	5982920	Congrats.
5982920	5983920	Yeah.
5983920	5987640	Yeah, that was not a very nice end to two days' worth of driving.
5987640	5988640	I bet.
5988640	5989640	Oh my gosh.
5989640	5991880	So you drove here all the way from Colorado where you live.
5991880	5995880	So do you drive nonstop and go over and sleep or where do you stop?
5995880	5999580	I could do it because it's about 20, 21 hours.
5999580	6004500	In this case, I left just before noon on Saturday.
6004500	6008140	Drove out to Nevada, stayed in Elko, Nevada.
6008140	6010140	Very tall, very small town.
6010140	6011940	About central Nevada.
6011940	6013540	And then continued the rest of the way.
6013540	6018660	The next day I pulled into the parking lot, nine o'clock local, I think.
6018660	6019660	Yeah.
6019660	6021940	I was going to say, you have to account for all that traffic.
6021940	6024120	So much of it too.
6024120	6028160	It would have been much more, much funner and more glorious to at least spend part A
6028160	6029160	down here.
6029160	6030160	But, oh well.
6030160	6031160	Whatever.
6031160	6032160	All right.
6032160	6034680	Well, let's get back into some gaming news, you guys.
6034680	6038480	Jason's with us to talk about whatever he wants with the gaming news and say his opinion.
6038480	6040520	Then you guys can share your opinions as well.
6040520	6044440	You can either do that live with us tonight, live.vognetwork.com if you're listening to
6044440	6045440	us on this Sunday night.
6045440	6048960	Or, of course, if you're listening to us on the podcast, you can always tweet at us at
6048960	6049960	OLR.
6049960	6053840	Or you can email us, mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com.
6053840	6057320	Let's check out some rapid fire news and quickly talk about a few things here.
6057320	6058320	Okay.
6058320	6059320	Yes.
6059320	6064480	So, since there really hasn't been too much going on with Minecraft on the Xbox 360 as
6064480	6072100	far as updates go, they have been putting out some skin packs to reskin the whole look
6072100	6076600	of Minecraft and sometimes include free levels and stuff.
6076600	6079120	They have another one coming out though for Halloween.
6079120	6086160	It kind of reskins everything, makes another nice and green and everything very Halloween-y.
6086160	6088000	And the price of that?
6088000	6089000	Free.
6089000	6090880	So, I think you can afford that.
6090880	6093240	So, go check it out if you haven't yet.
6093240	6097760	And also, creepers are nice and ghostly white now.
6097760	6099680	So, that's kind of fun.
6099680	6101800	And the Slenderman's about.
6101800	6103200	Ah, yes.
6103200	6108840	I'm assuming that they've redone the Enderman then to make him look like the Slenderman.
6108840	6111040	Very clever, I guess.
6111040	6112840	All right.
6112840	6118640	And then, on top of that, Grand Theft Auto, since I love talking about Grand Theft Auto.
6118640	6119920	Few things going on there.
6119920	6121680	There's some updates in November.
6121680	6126400	Some of the stuff that they were originally going to put out at launch for online, it's
6126400	6130560	been kind of delayed a little bit, including the stimulus package that's not coming out
6130560	6137600	now, which was supposed to have been last week, the first quarter million dollar payment.
6137600	6141480	It's going to be next week, I think, or maybe even beyond that.
6141520	6143720	The Beach Bum pack is something that they're going to put out.
6143720	6147760	It's the first piece of DLC that's going to be free, and it's going to add some weapons
6147760	6154680	and vehicles to the game, as well as clothing items, and that's both online and single player.
6154680	6160080	And then also, of course, the content creator for a deathmatch and races is going to be
6160080	6162760	available as well in November.
6162760	6167800	And so, you'll be able to create your own deathmatches and deathmatch arenas and races
6167840	6174040	in the game, which I think is going to be pretty awesome when we get to do that.
6174040	6179760	And last but not least, it's been leaked out that there is a new kind of zombie mode in
6179760	6185920	the game of Call of Duty Ghosts, except now, instead of zombies, it's extinction, and extinction
6185920	6191120	has to do with aliens, so you're fighting off aliens instead of zombies.
6191120	6195520	And they're going to have the different type of stuff to go along with that as well.
6195520	6198760	So, interesting.
6198760	6206040	I guess we'll learn more about that pretty soon, since the game comes out in two weeks.
6206040	6211280	Or you can always get your PlayStation 4 one early and just look at the box and think about
6211280	6212280	that alien mode, right?
6212280	6214000	Yeah, or the Xbox One.
6214000	6216160	You have extra time to contemplate that alien mode.
6216160	6217160	That's right.
6217160	6219720	You just sit there and think about it.
6219720	6222480	Killer Instinct, some more news coming out about that.
6222480	6226080	In fact, I've seen some footage coming out of those Xbox One preview events of Killer
6226080	6227080	Instinct.
6227080	6232960	It looks nice, but I got to admit, I'm not super duper excited about it.
6232960	6237440	I was hoping I'd be more excited about a new Killer Instinct, but whatever.
6237440	6242640	Don't let little old me get you in a bad mood about Killer Instinct, because there are some
6242640	6247440	neat things with this, including a training mode that is going to be available in the
6247440	6248440	game.
6248440	6252200	Killer Instinct does have a training mode, and there's some detailed information, again,
6252200	6254720	coming out of the preview events there.
6254720	6259960	Apparently, the highest difficulty level in the game, when you're in training mode, you
6259960	6264000	can do very easy, of course, and hard and so forth, but the most difficult level is
6264000	6266640	something called Kyle.
6266640	6271000	It's apparently named on one of the development team's AI designers, who is insanely good
6271000	6272000	at the game.
6272000	6276160	So you can fight Kyle, who I guess works there and is really, really good at Killer Instinct.
6276160	6277160	I hate you, Kyle.
6277160	6279160	I hate you, Kyle.
6279160	6282040	I like that one.
6282080	6285840	The training dummy can also do combo breakers against you, and so forth.
6285840	6289360	So just different ways to kind of learn and play the game.
6289360	6292480	More detailed information floating around out there on the internet.
6292480	6294720	We talked earlier about Wii U Virtual Console.
6294720	6297840	We were kind of joking about Virtual Console releases, and I mentioned that the past few
6297840	6302400	haven't been very good, but the good news is you got a great one this week.
6302400	6309600	On Halloween, nonetheless, Super Castlevania IV is the Wii U release on Virtual Console
6309600	6311600	this week on Halloween.
6311640	6313760	Now, I already had that when it was on the Wii.
6313760	6315600	Speaking of games, I have in the box.
6315600	6316600	That's right.
6316600	6319480	So I can get this for a dollar if I want to get the Wii U Virtual Console version, which
6319480	6320480	I probably will.
6320480	6321480	You can come to my house and play it.
6321480	6322480	I can, but...
6322480	6323480	Dude, that would be awesome.
6323480	6325400	A Castlevania festival on Halloween.
6325400	6326400	But I can't...
6326400	6330960	See, what I can do in my house that I can't do at your house is play Castlevania IV on
6330960	6331960	the toilet.
6331960	6333680	I almost said it in the toilet.
6333680	6334680	On the toilet.
6334680	6338360	Technically, I have a way to do this.
6338360	6340400	I have extension cords and very small TVs.
6340440	6343200	I guess I really shouldn't challenge you, should I?
6343200	6344200	Alright.
6344200	6346200	I'll think of a way.
6346200	6348400	Remember, 90% of what I have done?
6348400	6349400	Motivated by spite.
6349400	6350400	Yes.
6350400	6351400	And porn.
6351400	6357640	Anyhow, that was one of, obviously, the best Super Nintendo games and best games in the
6357640	6359400	Castlevania series.
6359400	6363240	Not my absolute favorite in the Castlevania series, but for some people, it is their favorite.
6363240	6365240	And I will say this, killer soundtrack.
6365240	6366240	Some of the best.
6366240	6367240	Oh, yeah.
6367240	6369760	But, you know, in my esteem, nothing beats Dracula X.
6370120	6371120	Symphony of the Night.
6371120	6373440	I know it's cliche, but damn it.
6373440	6374600	So freaking good.
6374600	6380800	I would say of the traditional Castlevania games, Dracula X.
6380800	6383160	Dracula X is more like a bridge between those styles.
6383160	6389040	I still have a soft spot for Simon's Quest, which I think is the earliest kind of Metroidvania
6389040	6390040	style game.
6390040	6391040	What a terrible night for a curse.
6391040	6392040	Anyway.
6392040	6394420	But we're digressing again.
6394420	6402700	How about some rumors about other Mario universe characters that could possibly be playable
6402700	6405100	in Super Mario 3D World?
6405100	6409700	There's some speculation out there because of stamp collecting that occurs in Super Mario
6409700	6410880	3D World.
6410880	6416440	There's some icons that have been spotted where, hmm, this kind of looks like Rosalina,
6416440	6420380	who you might remember from Super Mario Galaxy.
6420380	6425420	So anyhow, there's some other stamps in the game that apparently feature her there, so
6425420	6431220	it's a little interesting that she's so featured in a game she's not supposed to be in.
6431220	6434500	So there could be some other characters actually playable in the game.
6434500	6435500	We don't know yet.
6435500	6438980	This is all totally off speculation, but of course, if you didn't already know, Super
6438980	6445740	Mario 3D World is going to already have Luigi, Mario, Princess, and Toad in the style of
6445740	6448980	their appearance in Super Mario 2, where Princess floats.
6448980	6451260	Luigi has flappy legs, and all that stuff.
6451260	6453060	You mean Doki Doki Panic the ROM hack?
6453060	6454060	Well, same thing.
6454060	6456420	It was a little more than a ROM hack, though.
6456420	6460340	I know, I stole that from Game Sack, but it was probably the best name for it I've ever
6460340	6461340	heard.
6461340	6464900	So that'd be pretty cool if there were some additional little hidden characters that they
6464900	6465900	add into it.
6465900	6468180	It'd be very interesting what they could do with that.
6468180	6470300	I'm just looking forward to Cat Mario myself.
6470300	6472700	Dark Soccer, what do you have for us?
6472700	6473700	As stuff.
6473700	6474700	And things?
6474700	6475700	No, just stuff.
6476260	6480460	I have a site that won't load, so I'm skipping it.
6480460	6485140	And this is the very important news that everyone's been waiting for.
6485140	6488660	How to avoid Pokemon X and Y's game breaking bug.
6488660	6493620	First of all, you can download the patch, which is out.
6493620	6500180	The patch is out there on the 3BS eShop, and you just go there, update, blah blah blah,
6500180	6501180	you're done.
6501180	6504780	However, other ways around...
6504780	6505780	Did we finally breed?
6505780	6507660	I'm literally opening up the eShop right now.
6507660	6508660	I was like, oh shit, she's got a point.
6508660	6511340	I thought you were checking to see if we, um, if our machines...
6511340	6514260	No, our DS's do not want to mate today for some reason.
6514260	6516460	Here, I'll move you over there.
6516460	6517460	Very rude.
6517460	6519260	I even had mine hump yours, okay?
6519260	6520260	No.
6520260	6521260	Um...
6521260	6522260	Oh my.
6522260	6523260	Scandal.
6523260	6530660	Anyway, um, so the, um, other way that you could do that is that, like I said, Nintendo
6530660	6535660	had put out a map that showed where the bug could occur, and so it gave you areas that
6535660	6538860	you could save your game in and avoid the bug.
6538860	6545220	But now, um, with the, um, the fix that's come out, it also should correct any broken
6545220	6546500	game saves.
6546500	6551760	So wherever you saved, if you happen to have experienced this bug, if you haven't deleted
6551760	6555540	your save file, then, um, you should be fine.
6555540	6556540	It will be restored.
6556540	6559300	Just go to your eShop and download it.
6559300	6566580	In other news, um, oh god, I was just talking about Rival Schools a moment ago, too, um,
6566580	6573900	there is a, uh, some talk from, um, Hideaki Tsuno, um, who, uh, wants to create a Rival
6573900	6579300	Schools 3, and Rival Schools is probably, like, my all-time favorite number one fighting
6579300	6581500	game series ever in the world universe.
6581500	6582500	I love it.
6582500	6586700	I mean, I even like it better than all the Tekkens combined, and I really like me some
6586700	6587700	Tekken.
6587700	6592180	So, um, he was the past director of the Rival Schools series, and he did, um, recently did
6592180	6599540	Dragon's Dogma, and, um, he basically, you know, what was, uh, said about it is that
6599540	6605860	it was, it captured authentic fighting, um, as he said, basically, uh, Street Fighter
6605860	6608540	2 was his, um, inspiration.
6608540	6613940	So during an interview, he said, and this is with the Anime News Network, um, he said
6613940	6619460	that he was real, he would really like to make, um, any Rival Schools title, which honestly,
6619460	6621460	do it.
6621460	6622460	No hesitation.
6622460	6623460	Do it.
6623460	6624460	Bring back all the characters.
6624460	6625460	Put in some more.
6625460	6628140	You know, we haven't had all the sports, you know, done.
6628140	6630140	We need, we could have more hooligans.
6630140	6631140	Yeah.
6631140	6632140	We could, we could have more.
6632140	6634980	I was talking about this before the show with Rob, and I was saying that I really, really
6634980	6636860	miss Rival Schools Disc 2.
6636860	6639220	All of those minigames were incredibly fun.
6639220	6643420	Or, you know, you've had Sakura in the game now for two versions of it.
6643420	6648060	I mean, she was a hidden character in the first one, and officially in, um, well, you
6648060	6652420	know, I have the Evolution Disc that had, like, the dancing game and the dating sim
6652420	6653720	and all that in it.
6653720	6658380	I paid a hundred bucks for that sucker when I had money, and it's freaking awesome.
6658380	6662620	I'll have to, I'll have to show you some stuff on it, but, like, I got, like, Batsu asked
6662620	6669920	my character out, and it was all cool and cute, um, but, uh, there were, um, that's
6669920	6676640	the game that introduced the Taicho, the, the class president, and, uh, the photographer,
6676640	6682800	and, uh, dude who swims, why can't I remember his name, but, um, that's the game that introduced
6682800	6685320	a lot of those characters that were in Rival Schools 2, and then Rival Schools 2 brought
6685320	6689600	out my favorite of all time, Zaki, um, but, I mean, just think about it.
6689600	6692120	It's about time.
6692120	6693120	Why not?
6693120	6696560	Yeah, and I'm actually, now I'm done filling time for the story that wouldn't load.
6696560	6697560	Alright.
6698200	6700280	I can finish one off on that note.
6700280	6705600	My, you know, convinced, conventional popular still going fighting games I love, but either
6705600	6710760	Rival, Rival Schools or Bloody Roar are probably my two favorites from that era.
6710760	6712800	Bloody Roar was an interesting game.
6712800	6713800	It's very interesting.
6713800	6717080	Didn't they actually remake that in, like, the last couple years?
6717080	6718080	No.
6718080	6719080	I don't recall.
6719080	6720080	I'm just crazy.
6720080	6724920	You may be thinking of, uh, Beast Riser with the, I don't know why they call it Beast Riser.
6724920	6729080	That's just such a dumb name for it, but I think that's what they came out, I think
6729080	6732360	that was the Japanese name for it, because it had an arcade version of it.
6732360	6735800	My ad's a rip-off of Bloody Roar, and it's the same damn name.
6735800	6741960	At least it wasn't brutal Paul's a Fury, because that was kind of crap.
6741960	6745560	Alright, uh, before we get to the face, or the Fugu question of the week, we skipped
6745560	6746560	the story.
6746560	6747560	Yeah, I was like, did you need me to do that?
6747560	6748560	Because it wouldn't load on her iPad, right?
6748560	6753480	Yeah, it wouldn't load at all, which, basically anything that I ever get from that site won't
6753480	6754480	load.
6755040	6756040	Well, here we go.
6756040	6759440	Uh, this is important because it was in the intro, so we have to cover it.
6759440	6760440	Sorry, sorry.
6760440	6761440	No, that's fine.
6761440	6766520	It has been found, the ToeJam and Earl 3, Mission to Earth.
6766520	6767520	That's right.
6767520	6771700	Sega apparently made that for the Xbox, of course, but did you know that there was another
6771700	6776720	ToeJam and Earl 3 at one point that was being made for the Dreamcast?
6776720	6781760	Some footage is now online, and apparently the owner of the disc wants to have a fundraiser
6781760	6783120	to get the code online.
6783760	6787760	Now, it is unfinished, it was not a finished game, so the project was never completed,
6787760	6789840	but this would be the missing ToeJam and Earl game.
6789840	6793680	So it is not ToeJam and Earl Xbox, but it's ToeJam and Earl 3 Dreamcast.
6793680	6798080	Why not just do a Kickstarter to finish the game?
6798080	6801320	That would be pretty cool, but I imagine all these developers are in different, I mean,
6801320	6802320	this is coded what?
6802320	6803320	This would have been like 15 years ago.
6803320	6804920	Yeah, but how much of the code was done?
6804920	6809360	Well, I mean, we can see some gameplay here if I kind of start it up here and fast forward
6809360	6810520	just a little bit in the video.
6810560	6813240	ToeJam and Earl 3 back from the dead.
6813240	6815440	Yeah, they're pretty good.
6815440	6818360	I mean, definitely the usual Dreamcast pop-in, but...
6818360	6819360	Yeah.
6819360	6821360	Ahh, crazy cheerleader.
6821360	6830400	Um, so, uh, but I mean, depending on how much of it is done, if the assets are there, then
6830400	6835040	I would think it used to be a matter of finishing the maybe level layouts and that type of thing.
6835040	6836400	This sounds like a call for an actor.
6836400	6837400	Star gladiator!
6837400	6840480	Oh my god, IkumaJP, I love you forever, because Star Gladiator was awesome.
6841440	6843840	All right, now we can do the FUGL question of the week, yes?
6843840	6844840	I guess.
6844840	6845840	I guess.
6845840	6849240	All right, Dark Soccer is going to per-miss it at some point here, so here we go.
6849240	6850880	You take Facebook, you take Google Plus.
6850880	6851880	Per-miss.
6851880	6853800	Slam those words to give permission.
6853800	6854800	Per-mit.
6854800	6855800	Per-whatever.
6855800	6859800	It's ready to go home.
6863800	6868840	Facebook and Google Plus, slam them together and you get FUGL Plus, or we just call it
6868840	6869840	FUGL.
6870200	6873280	I'm going to read some of the answers here, and we had a lot of answers, you guys, over
6873280	6874600	on Facebook and Google Plus.
6874600	6875600	I can't read them all.
6875600	6876600	There is not enough time.
6876600	6878600	I'm going to read some of these, though.
6878600	6884200	And the question we asked this week, what is the scariest moment you've ever experienced
6884200	6885200	in a video game?
6885200	6886400	I mean, Halloween's next week, right?
6886400	6889000	So why not ask a question about scary games?
6889000	6890000	In spirit.
6890000	6893040	How about when I thought Aerith was going to come back to life?
6893040	6894040	That's a good answer.
6894040	6895040	There you go.
6895040	6896040	Okay.
6896040	6901120	Or mine would be in probably when I was playing Silent Hill 4, The Room, and I literally screamed
6901120	6904600	out loud and one of those baby face monsters came running at me and Loki was like, what
6904600	6905600	the hell are you doing?
6905600	6906600	It's back when we lived together.
6906600	6909480	You know, the only thing that creeped me out in that game was the giant head.
6909480	6910480	Oh, yeah.
6910480	6911480	And not me.
6911480	6912480	To just watch you.
6912480	6913480	All right.
6913480	6914480	Anyhow.
6914480	6915480	Well, let's see what the listeners have to say, Darzara.
6915480	6919520	Starting us off on Facebook, Gemit says, anything Slender Man or Outlast?
6919520	6922280	I can't believe I'm opening myself for Rob to razz.
6922280	6926920	Luckily, I already did that earlier in the show, and Gemit just joined chat, so he probably
6926920	6927920	missed it.
6927920	6931520	For the record, I officially look at it the same.
6931520	6932520	Did he?
6932520	6933520	What did he do?
6933520	6935200	Did he help you with something on Final Fantasy?
6935200	6937120	No, for admitting that you would razz.
6937120	6938400	Oh, this is true.
6938400	6940400	And being better than that.
6940400	6941400	Very true.
6941400	6942400	Let's see.
6942400	6943960	Going to some other answers.
6943960	6949040	Dead Rising says, after gathering like 30,000 pp and then trying to run to a save point
6949040	6951480	while killing zombies on my last health bar.
6951480	6952480	Scary.
6952480	6956920	I think that was Mike saying the game Dead Rising, because the 30,000 points.
6956920	6957920	Oh.
6957920	6960800	See, when somebody writes...
6960800	6961800	Thank you.
6961800	6965080	When they write their name like that, I'm like, is that what you want us to call you?
6965080	6966080	Okay.
6966080	6967640	He's definitely talking about Dead Rising the game.
6967640	6969520	I can say that with 100% certainty.
6969520	6970520	There you go.
6970520	6971520	It does involve zombies.
6971520	6972960	Let's see.
6972960	6973960	Some more answers here.
6973960	6977560	Scott W says, it always comes back to the dog crashing through the window in Resident
6977560	6978560	Evil.
6979080	6980080	Oh, my God.
6980080	6981080	I remember that.
6981080	6982080	It was so scary.
6982080	6985760	Strudels89 says, playing The Last of Us in the Dark with my husband.
6985760	6989860	Walking around a corner, thinking we're safe, then having two clickers jump out and rip
6989860	6990920	Joel's throat out.
6990920	6994400	I screamed so loud and threw my controller on the bed.
6994400	6998840	Catfury05 says, the first time I saw Pyramid Head in Silent Hill 2.
6998840	7000200	Still scares me to this day.
7000200	7003360	That was pretty creepy.
7003360	7005560	Mary B says, Fatal Frame.
7005560	7008960	We were in our apartment in the dark, having played for a couple hours.
7008960	7011520	As Pat said, they never attack on the stairs.
7011520	7015120	He was promptly attacked from above by one of those ghastly creatures, and I let out
7015120	7016920	a blood curdling scream.
7016920	7020980	Game controller was thrown, lights turned on, and we were done for the night.
7020980	7025200	That and all of Fatal Frame's freaking celerity ghosts.
7025200	7026200	Is that Mary Moo?
7026200	7027200	Yes, it is.
7027200	7028280	Oh, I love Mary.
7028280	7030320	That is your friend, Mary.
7030320	7031320	Let's see.
7031320	7035800	Ray responds and says, still being a kid and playing Friday the 13th on the NES.
7035800	7037800	That game was so bad.
7037800	7039280	No, that game was underrated.
7039280	7040280	It was good.
7040280	7041280	It was awful.
7041280	7043820	It was good for what it was.
7043820	7045360	There were better games, yes.
7045360	7047200	The Friday the 13th game was worse.
7047200	7048200	Alright.
7048200	7050600	Not Friday the 13th, the Nightmare on the Street game.
7050600	7051600	The blah blah.
7051600	7052600	Uh, let's see.
7052600	7054320	Eric D says, Resident Evil 2.
7054320	7057700	When you get to the jail cells in the basement and the dogs break out and start chasing you
7057700	7058920	down some dark hallways.
7058920	7060520	Man, that scared the crap out of me.
7060520	7063600	So there's another one for dogs in Resident Evil.
7063600	7064600	Let's see.
7064600	7067280	Justin M says, the opening of Half Life 2 was pretty unnerving.
7067280	7070220	As was the in-browser boogeyman movie tie-in game.
7070220	7074520	Scared the bejesus out of me freshman year of college.
7074520	7079360	K. Sera Sera says, I don't play a lot of scary games really, but the first one that
7079360	7084200	ever creeped me out was the first adventure game that I ever played, Sanitarium.
7084200	7087920	There was a level where you were exploring an abandoned mental hospital with remnants
7087920	7089360	of bodies laying around.
7089360	7093400	The combination of this gross empty hospital, the creepy music, and the main character's
7093400	7096880	inner monologue definitely left me creeped out.
7096880	7099600	So those are only some of the answers, and I'm sorry I didn't read them all, but those
7099600	7104080	are some of the answers from our Facebook page over at Facebook.com slash Orange Launch
7104080	7105080	Radio.
7105080	7107440	Please go read the rest, because there's some great answers involving, like, Oculus Rift
7107440	7110040	and some other stuff too, so check it out.
7110040	7112600	Going to Google Plus and reading some answers there.
7112600	7116760	The birthday boy, ActDeft, says, playing a version on PC.
7116760	7120600	It starts out sweet and nice, and then the game starts messing with you in really freaked
7120600	7121600	out ways.
7121600	7125240	I played and finished the game in one sitting, but I was alone in my house and it was getting
7125240	7128960	dark too, so I really got scared as I progressed through it.
7128960	7134120	And lastly, Colin M. says, the PC version of Slender freaked me out sometime between
7134120	7136200	finding the fifth and sixth pages.
7136200	7139860	My flashlight had burned out and I was basically running around in the dark before the Slender
7139860	7140860	Man caught me.
7140860	7143280	Yeah, Slender Man, super scary game.
7143280	7147920	I don't know, until you've played it so many times, you kind of start to figure out the
7147920	7152200	patterns and it's numbed a little bit, but still a really good experience.
7152200	7154040	IKUMA JP just made my heart leap.
7154040	7156440	There was a Ju-On game for Wii.
7156440	7157440	Was it really?
7157440	7158440	Are you serious?
7158440	7159440	And I need this in my life.
7159440	7160440	I didn't know.
7160440	7161440	Oh yeah, I remember that.
7161440	7162440	It was terrible.
7162440	7163440	What?
7163440	7164440	You said it was good.
7164440	7165440	Didn't you say that?
7165440	7166440	No, I remember that came out a few years ago.
7166440	7167440	No, you just said it was scary.
7167440	7170200	And I remember telling everybody about that multiple times, especially you.
7170200	7173120	Yeah, well, I don't remember that because I don't pay attention to the Wii.
7173120	7174120	It's been a while.
7174120	7176640	I need this in my life and I don't care how bad it is.
7176640	7180640	I played the Project Runway game on Wii, which was pretty bad, but it's just a thing.
7180640	7181640	You have to try it.
7181640	7185600	I remember a scary moment when I thought my save file got corrupted.
7185600	7188400	I remember another scary moment in games.
7188400	7189400	Actually I thought of one.
7189400	7192120	What was the Silent Hill on 360 called?
7192120	7193120	The first one.
7193120	7194120	Silent Hill Homecoming?
7194120	7195120	Yes, Homecoming.
7195120	7196120	Homecoming was good.
7196120	7197120	I played that.
7197120	7199620	With that kid.
7199620	7204700	And I was home by myself in the dark and it was raining outside.
7204700	7208620	And you know how like when you're in the hospital in the very beginning, like a body falls just
7208620	7212140	from the air duct or something, like it just falls down in front of you?
7212140	7215140	You go, let the bodies hit the...
7215140	7217860	Well, I screamed and jumped out of my chair.
7217860	7222520	And because it was storming outside, the front door blew open.
7222520	7226900	And I promptly, like you can even see, step one, ran, slammed the door.
7226900	7229740	Step two, closed off the Xbox without even saving.
7229740	7232660	Step three, ran into the bedroom and got into the covers and cried.
7232660	7233660	I didn't really cry.
7233660	7239220	At least you said it was the Xbox, because if it was the Wii or the GameCube or something,
7239220	7244140	there is a potential that Rosetti may have come back and given you a nice long lecture
7244140	7246020	afterwards, which is equally scary.
7246020	7249700	Now there is a game that I mentioned in chat that I haven't heard anyone say anything about.
7249700	7250700	What's that?
7250700	7251700	Phantasmagoria.
7251700	7252700	Oh yeah, the old PC.
7252700	7255260	Which I have covered as a classic game.
7255300	7257980	Wasn't that Roberta Williams' last game or like one of her last games?
7257980	7258980	I think so.
7258980	7259980	Yeah, before she...
7259980	7264180	But I mean, that game was pretty hardcore for its time.
7264180	7266100	It was way ahead of its time.
7266100	7269340	And it was literally on seven or eight CDs.
7269340	7270340	It was seven.
7270340	7272100	It was all that...
7272100	7275340	That was during that phase, we had a really quick phase in gaming, it was right around
7275340	7276340	the same time as the Sega CD.
7276340	7277340	The full motion.
7277340	7279140	Yeah, the full motion acting.
7279140	7280900	Dan and I were actually just talking about that earlier today.
7280900	7284380	Because you had what, like Sewer Shark and Night Trap are some infamous Sega CD games
7284380	7285380	that had that.
7285380	7289660	Was it Super Soldier or some other game like that, that was a 32X CD game?
7289660	7290660	Well, I remember...
7290660	7294500	That only came out in some country, I don't remember.
7294500	7299620	Well, I remember on the PC you had Phantasmagoria, Seventh Guest was a huge one, and you're seeing
7299620	7300620	that.
7300620	7301620	They just re-released that on Steam.
7301620	7302620	And what was the sequel, Eleventh Hour?
7302620	7303620	Eleventh Hour.
7303620	7308140	And then, of course, SimCity with SimCity Action News.
7308140	7309140	Wing Commander.
7309140	7310980	The X-Files was on like eight or nine disc.
7310980	7312580	Wasn't Wing Commander 3 that one?
7312580	7313580	I only remember four.
7313780	7314780	I don't remember the first couple.
7314780	7315780	Wing Commander 3 was the one with Mark Hamill in it.
7315780	7316780	Yeah, I think so.
7316780	7317780	I believe so.
7317780	7318780	Gabriel Knight.
7318780	7319780	Yeah.
7319780	7320780	Gabriel Knight.
7320780	7321780	Tim Tripp just said.
7321780	7322780	Tim Tripp.
7322780	7323780	Yeah.
7323780	7324780	Didn't Gabriel Knight have Tim Curry?
7324780	7325780	I think it was just acted.
7325780	7326780	Maybe it was in the sequel.
7326780	7327780	Yeah.
7327780	7332420	But, I mean, there were tons of different horror games out that, you know, I'm sure
7332420	7333420	scared people.
7333420	7338620	But going back to the day, even old, you know, text games, I mean, being eaten by a grue
7338620	7339620	is pretty scary.
7339620	7340620	It is pretty scary.
7340620	7341620	Very scary.
7341660	7342660	All right.
7342660	7345940	Let's do a few more stories and then the mailbag and phone calls and all that.
7345940	7346940	So, Loki.
7346940	7347940	All right.
7347940	7351940	So, the Ouya.
7351940	7353660	They changed a few things.
7353660	7356700	One, they're redesigning the controller for the Ouya 2.
7356700	7358580	Yes, the Ouya 2 will be out next year.
7358580	7361380	At least that's what's planned right now.
7361380	7363860	And they're going back and redesigning the controller.
7363860	7367460	Actually, I think they've already redesigned the controller now and I'm kind of like confused
7367460	7370340	by it because I know that they redesigned the controller from when they kickstarted
7370340	7372820	to when they released.
7372820	7375940	But now they're talking about redesigning it again.
7375940	7381180	And one of the questions was, so, how am I going to know if I buy an Ouya if it's going
7381180	7384380	to be the one that has the redesigned controller that's supposed to be better or the older
7384380	7387240	one that the controller is not so good?
7387240	7393580	And Julie, Julie Ehrman said, you don't know.
7393580	7396100	So that's a great answer.
7396100	7397780	There is no way to distinguish that.
7397780	7405620	And of course, they're right now planning on shipping the Ouya 2, I guess, sometime
7405620	7408820	in 2014.
7408820	7413020	And they haven't finalized the date on it yet, but they're kind of investigating right
7413020	7416800	now what kind of graphics chip they want to put inside there to be able to support the
7416800	7423220	older games as well as push a little bit better performance out of newer games and titles.
7423220	7427240	I understand them bringing out another console so that they can find their happy medium and
7427240	7430680	find what's going to work and be relatively future proof.
7430680	7434080	But two consoles in two years.
7434080	7440040	I don't if the apology if they make that if they make that a trend, it just seems really
7440040	7442440	stupid for something that's supposed to be an Internet console.
7442440	7444560	Aren't you an iPhone user?
7444560	7454880	I just say point point, but I'm just saying I'm still using my 4S and and keep in mind
7454880	7458760	all of their all quality products as opposed to the Ouya.
7458760	7463920	Yeah, you don't have to buy every revision they they bring it forward because they have
7463920	7464920	new things.
7464920	7469800	I'm still I'm still rocking my iPad third generation, aka the one that Apple would rather
7469800	7471160	you just forget about.
7471160	7475520	You know, this is the only other iPad they still sell the iPad 2.
7475520	7476520	Right?
7476520	7477520	Yes.
7477520	7480000	And all I have to say to hell with the iPad Air.
7480000	7482840	I'm still going to rock that iPad third generation do it.
7482840	7483840	That's right.
7483840	7485680	I got a display in my old school charger.
7485680	7488720	It's all I need to do it.
7488720	7489720	Loki's like, can I finish?
7489720	7491720	We're also talking about like a six hundred dollar difference.
7491720	7492720	But please.
7492720	7494040	Well, here's the thing, too.
7494040	7498920	The problem, though, with coming out with an Ouya 2.0 or whatever is you're not coming
7498920	7500500	out now first anymore.
7500500	7505720	Now you're coming out in potentially a field where there are going to be multiple consoles
7505720	7510120	out there that do the same type of thing, whose amateurs will blow yours away.
7510120	7511120	Exactly.
7511120	7515120	You can do your thing better and for probably cheaper.
7515120	7519160	And one of the things that, you know, she's basically said, oh, hey, you know what?
7519160	7523360	We're open to cloud gaming and hey, we're even open to our storefront being on third
7523360	7524360	party hardware.
7524360	7525780	We'll do anything.
7525780	7527120	So we'll blow anyone.
7527120	7530200	Why the fuck would I want to buy an Ouya 2?
7530200	7533680	We're open to putting a flashlight in the side of the console.
7533680	7537120	And it says that if they really wanted to be clever, they are passing up a fantastic
7537120	7538560	marketing idea.
7538560	7539560	The 2.0.
7539560	7540560	I'm just saying.
7541000	7544320	I'm just saying if they put a flashlight in a porn edition, that's what people really
7544320	7545320	want.
7545320	7547360	If they put a flashlight in the side of that console, it's going to have to be for really
7547360	7550240	small dick people because that is a really small console.
7550240	7555360	I just know the flashlight will be bigger than the console.
7555360	7560400	So what you're saying is it will look like a giant cylinder, a.k.a. the new Mac that
7560400	7561400	they have out there.
7561400	7563640	It looks like a fucking trash can.
7563640	7565400	It actually does.
7565400	7566400	I can't argue it.
7566400	7570280	I can like say it's way sage and give this shit.
7570280	7571520	It's expensive.
7571520	7573880	It does slightly better things than the last one.
7573880	7580960	You'll release yet another computer in a year or two that will look stupid and will do something
7580960	7583840	slightly better than the other one will be fucking expensive and everyone will go buy
7583840	7584840	it.
7584840	7590800	The other problem with the Ouya is that because they didn't discontinue the Wii in North America,
7590800	7596240	you can get a dirt fucking cheap console here that plays a heck of a lot more games than
7596240	7597880	what's really available on Ouya.
7597880	7598880	I gotta be honest.
7599600	7606280	If you're out there in the market and you're like, hell, I need a system to play Android
7606280	7613380	games on my TV and that's what I wanna do, go with the fucking Mojo console because at
7613380	7620160	least that one uses Google Play for one and two, you can use your controller and map it
7620160	7622380	to pretty much any game you want.
7622380	7628200	So that includes stuff that's probably on the Ouya already and stuff that's in the Google
7628200	7630280	Play marketplace that's free.
7630280	7637960	So why would you spend money on this stuff that has a locked out marketplace, which let
7637960	7638960	me put it this way.
7638960	7640560	I had the console for a while.
7640560	7642240	There are some okay games on there.
7642240	7645480	They're promising there's gonna be more games on there that'll be good, but you know what?
7645480	7648960	All those people, they're fucking not just making their games exclusively to the Ouya.
7648960	7652000	It's coming out in PC and Android and all that stuff.
7652000	7658200	So you might as well just put the money into a Steam box or a computer that runs Steam
7658200	7663200	or something or put it into another micro console or just fucking just...
7663200	7667400	Or give it to me and we'll buy a new mic for the show or something.
7667400	7669400	Just don't waste your money on this stuff.
7669400	7671000	We could use a new mic.
7671000	7674760	Or buy a used Ouya, I mean, if you really want to.
7674760	7675760	I don't know.
7675760	7677780	I just don't see, there's not a lot.
7677780	7680660	There's no real reason why you want to get a new Ouya.
7680660	7688580	Because they were saying before, oh, you're gonna be able to run XBMC on it and stuff.
7688580	7692160	Well except it doesn't run it very well, so why would you do that?
7692160	7698760	You can get really cheap tablets nowadays and a lot of them already have HDMI out.
7698760	7703580	So I don't know, especially with what?
7703580	7706920	The Google thing that they have now where you can plug it into your TV and more support
7706960	7707960	for apps for that.
7707960	7708960	Chromecast.
7708960	7714040	Yeah Chromecast, you don't really need a micro console because a lot of other shit is doing
7714040	7715040	this stuff already.
7715040	7719920	It's like Dan and I were talking this morning about taking, because we're probably gonna
7719920	7725360	eventually gut our front room computer and put it in a new frame and I was like, well
7725360	7728880	you have people who build like the Nintendo computers with the small bits.
7728880	7735120	I've wanted to do one out of a 1950s radio, but I mean you can build these things for
7735120	7739000	yourself at home and they'll run whatever you need them to run within reason.
7739000	7743700	You know, coming by parts is just a matter of smart shopping.
7743700	7747400	Especially if you're gonna make a system, if all you're interested in is emulators,
7747400	7750760	you don't need that powerful of a system to run emulators.
7750760	7751760	I mean seriously.
7751760	7753800	Get a Dreamcast.
7753800	7757120	Just buy a fucking old ass PC, you can probably do that.
7757120	7760240	Yeah Dreamcast, but Dreamcast even that doesn't run everything very smoothly.
7760240	7761240	It'll run Nintendo.
7761240	7765720	You still have to go through some hoops for that, but just get an old PC.
7765720	7770360	That's what our front room computer that we have was pretty much given to us when someone
7770360	7771360	was done with it.
7771360	7773360	I think it was Dan's mom or somebody.
7773360	7777960	But I mean all we use it for is emulator games so we don't feel like busting out the Super
7777960	7783240	Nintendo and watching Netflix and Hulu.
7783240	7784240	That's it.
7784240	7789120	And also if you're interested in buying a Ouya and god forbid they kickstart something
7789120	7793740	else again, just remember how wonderful the Kickstarter went the first time around.
7793740	7795200	Ask up front who's shipping.
7795200	7801200	As in, as in right now, some people that backed that Kickstarter still don't have their fucking
7801200	7802880	console yet.
7802880	7803880	Just saying.
7803880	7810080	And for the record, at Radio Shack where my husband manages, I saw laptops there that
7810080	7815520	were fully equipped to do everything that the Ouya can do for 250 bucks.
7815520	7820600	So you can get a laptop instead of getting that piece of garbage.
7820600	7821600	It's still not 99.
7821600	7822600	It's still not 99.
7822600	7823600	All right.
7823600	7824600	Yeah, but you get a lot more value.
7824600	7826240	It was to say that the next one's going to be $99.
7826240	7827240	That's the other thing too.
7827240	7828240	All right.
7828240	7829240	Moving on.
7829240	7830240	Moving on, guys.
7830240	7835120	I it's a another week, so there must be another story coming out of EA somewhere that's hating
7835120	7836680	on the Wii U.
7836680	7839120	And here we go.
7839120	7842620	Creative director Craig Sullivan from Ghost Games.
7842620	7845400	So technically it's not EA, but you know.
7845400	7849040	So Craig Sullivan with Ghost Games is making Need for Speed Rivals.
7849040	7854120	And in an interview with the Sixaxis talks about why it's not coming to the Wii U.
7854120	7859160	Rivals is going on new hardware and you have to work out where you focus your efforts.
7859160	7863760	The 200 people working on this game are only capable of so much and doing so many different
7863760	7864800	versions of the game.
7864800	7868320	So we had to go with where we think the biggest audience will be for the game.
7868320	7870520	And that's where we are.
7870520	7875160	As you may or may not know, Need for Speed Rivals is running on the Frostbite 3 engine.
7875160	7878660	This year we had news that they're not going to bother with putting Frostbite 3 engine
7878660	7883240	on the Wii U, back when EA kind of first was talking about how they're distancing themselves
7883240	7887400	from the Wii U, because the Wii U can't handle it or whatever, which means it's not going
7887400	7889200	to get Dragon Age or Mass Effect.
7889200	7892040	It's not going to get any of that, because those are all going to be on the Frostbite
7892040	7894800	3 engine as well.
7894800	7896680	So there you go.
7896680	7900640	Need for Speed Rivals not coming on the Wii U anytime soon.
7900640	7907280	And stories like this are never really a great sign for that system, but Nintendo is going
7907280	7912400	to keep pumping out their games that will carry that system well enough.
7912400	7917600	And I also kind of think, I've got to be really honest here when it comes to the whole journalism
7917600	7923760	element of this story, I kind of think in this interview you're baiting this guy to
7923760	7925460	hate on the Wii U.
7925460	7929740	Because I think when you look at a game like Need for Speed Rivals, or a lot of the stuff
7929860	7935860	that goes to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, you know the Wii U can't handle that stuff.
7935860	7941620	Like, you know, the Wii U is based a little more off the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, granted
7941620	7945460	what's in there is a little more powerful, but we all kind of know that what's inside
7945460	7949940	a Wii U is not the same thing that's inside these other systems.
7949940	7952580	So weren't we kind of baiting this guy a little bit?
7952580	7956140	Isn't the answer obvious why this game is not on Wii U?
7956140	7961220	Well, it's like you said, that they're making it for multiple consoles, and so they only
7961220	7965660	have enough, okay we can only put it on X number of different consoles, and so we're
7965660	7968900	going to pick the ones that have what we think are going to be the largest market share.
7968900	7970420	I mean, that just makes sense.
7970420	7973220	But yes, they are masturbators.
7973220	7977460	Dark Tetsuya in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, this story frustrates me, because I
7977460	7981740	love Need for Speed and I want a Wii U, and that customization stuff would be perfect
7981740	7982740	for the touchpad.
7983340	7988340	Yeah, it's kind of a bummer, more people don't think to do it, but...
7988340	7993820	If only, you know, the Xbox 360 had a second screen app or something that you could, you
7993820	7996900	know, use the touchpad to do customization.
7996900	7998820	If only they had that!
7998820	8002620	Didn't you listen to Bobby's show earlier tonight, when our good pal Bobby Blackwolf
8002620	8004780	always tapes before us here at VOG Network.
8004780	8008660	He was talking about, he went to the Xbox One preview event in Atlanta, and was like
8008700	8014100	asking questions about, now I don't even remember the name of it, Smart Glass.
8014100	8017100	I just think Smart Ass, like Smart Ass, like Loki, but it's Smart Glass.
8017100	8019300	You mean that app I downloaded that I've never used?
8019300	8023060	They didn't even know what it was.
8023060	8025700	The people that were demoing, like, because he asked one of the games he was playing,
8025700	8027620	he was like, oh, how does this integrate Smart Glass?
8027620	8031700	Because it had a really kind of, it was like drawing, and they were like, what's Smart
8031700	8032700	Glass?
8032700	8033700	I...
8033700	8034700	What?
8034700	8035700	What?
8035700	8037220	That definitely is deserved.
8037220	8038820	Mark Zuckerberg will know what I'm talking about with this.
8038820	8044580	That's definitely a moment where you just kind of look at that person and go, girl.
8044580	8049340	It's kind of funny, because there's a lot of opportunity in theory with the surface
8049340	8051340	for stuff like that.
8051340	8052340	Right?
8052340	8054460	Well, anyway.
8054460	8058960	It's like, you've got all this second screen technology, like slapping you in the face,
8058960	8061620	and still nobody wants to jump on boards.
8061620	8064100	Except Nintendo, sorta.
8064100	8067860	Although certainly there's those wank rumors that they're thinking about releasing a new
8067860	8070740	Wii that doesn't have the touchpad, so they can rule the button.
8070740	8071740	A Wii U?
8071740	8072740	Yeah, that's what I meant.
8072740	8073740	The Wii U without the touchpad.
8073740	8074740	But I don't know.
8074740	8077060	And again, wank, wank, wank, wank, wank.
8077060	8078980	I don't know how much stock I put in there.
8078980	8079980	Why?
8079980	8084460	At that point, it's like, you're taking the gimmick out, so now there's no reason.
8084460	8085780	It is...
8085780	8088220	Yeah, because that worked so well with the Wii Mini.
8088220	8091660	They took out all the extra features that you didn't really need, like internet, you
8091660	8092660	know, and...
8092660	8095220	Back and focus on what made the Wii so popular.
8095220	8097620	All that, the flailing with the controller.
8097620	8098620	Why not?
8098620	8100620	Wii Sports HD, buddy.
8100620	8103140	It's coming.
8103140	8109320	Anyhow, let's see what the listeners think in a segment we call the Mailbag.
8109320	8113740	Every week, you guys send us emails, mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com, and Dark Soccer
8113740	8120140	will dive into the mailbag headfirst and find some emails that she deems worthy of being
8120140	8121140	read here on the show.
8121140	8122140	I know we...
8122140	8123140	I gotta...
8123140	8126540	We spoiled this a little bit earlier in the show with one email, but there's still plenty
8126540	8129140	more unlicked, unspoiled emails to go.
8129140	8130140	We got a bunch.
8130140	8131140	We did get a lot tonight, didn't we?
8131140	8133140	We got a couple more, actually, after checking the mailbag.
8133140	8134620	Oh, you don't have to read them all, you know?
8134620	8136140	Well, I'm gonna, because Gonna emailed.
8136140	8137140	All right.
8137140	8138140	Well, you can skip his.
8138140	8139140	Shit.
8139140	8140140	You know what?
8140140	8141140	I'm just kidding.
8141140	8143140	Hi, Jamie, Loki, and I guess Rob.
8143140	8144900	You see what I mean?
8144900	8145900	Yeah.
8145900	8149460	I heard Rob talking about Pokemon not really utilizing the 3D, and I was curious if you
8149460	8152900	guys think it's even worth it to buy the 3DS or just go with the 2DS.
8152900	8157340	I'm still trying to decide between the two, and I would love to hear what you all think.
8157340	8160660	Thanks for making my unbearable weekend commutes less horrible, Gemet.
8160660	8163020	Wear pants with large pockets.
8163020	8165420	No, 3DS.
8165420	8167520	Yes, 2DS.
8167520	8169100	If you have a man bag.
8169100	8170100	That's true.
8170100	8171100	If you have...
8171100	8172100	Gemet probably does accessorize with a man purse.
8172100	8175560	They do have cases for the 2DS.
8175560	8181380	In all honesty, I still think the 3DS XL is the best system because the screens are still
8181380	8186440	larger on an XL, and I might also be a little biased because I really want that freaking
8186440	8190080	Zelda 3DS XL that's coming out.
8190080	8195560	So I still think the XL is the best one of any of them, but the 2DS is not a bad alternative,
8195560	8197200	and it is a much lower price.
8197200	8202800	So you kind of have to just ask yourself, how much is A, a bigger screen, and B, 3D
8202800	8203800	worth?
8203800	8207040	Otherwise, functionally, they're really the same system.
8207040	8212720	But if all you want to do is play Pokemon, then shit, get the 2DS.
8212720	8213720	It doesn't really matter.
8213720	8218400	But if you're thinking about the future, the 3D does really come in handy in some games
8218400	8220480	like Super Mario 3D Land you're talking about.
8220480	8221760	3D is really useful in that game.
8221760	8226120	I use it actually on occasion in Animal Crossing, even though I can't keep the 3D on for very
8226120	8232280	long, but I use it to catch flying bugs just because sometimes it's really hard to tell
8232280	8238120	where they are in relation to where you are without the 3D.
8238120	8243440	It also depends, I mean, even though I don't use the 3D, if I had a choice between the
8243440	8247840	two, if someone was like, here, pick one, I'd still probably stick with the 3DS because
8247840	8250460	I also like having it collapse.
8250460	8252760	I like having it close.
8252760	8256940	And that's always been something to like, because I actually adjust my screen level
8256940	8262240	depending on if I'm sitting down and playing, if I happen to be in the car, which I don't
8262240	8264580	really play that much in the car, but...
8264580	8267880	You really do have to question some of the design choices around the 2DS.
8267880	8268880	I mean, it feels...
8268880	8269880	It's intended for kids.
8269880	8273480	When it's in your hands, it feels nice, but yeah, just the whole fact it doesn't close
8273480	8274480	is, I don't know.
8274480	8275720	But I get the hinges right.
8275720	8277120	You were moving parts.
8277120	8278120	Yeah.
8278120	8281720	Well, on top of that, you have wires running in the hinges too.
8281720	8283040	It's just like with a regular laptop.
8283040	8284040	Sure, sure.
8284040	8289480	So you have a lot more room to make it completely unplayable as opposed to, you know, one full
8289480	8292320	put together hard plastic piece.
8292320	8296720	So honestly, Gemit, you kind of just have to ask yourself, like, how much is it worth?
8296720	8301240	Like, am I willing to pay that extra money to have the larger screens and have it close
8301240	8302240	up?
8302240	8304320	And if that's really not a big deal to you and there's really only the one game you want
8304320	8306160	to play on it, then fuck it, get a 2DS.
8306160	8307160	Why not?
8307160	8310640	By the way, Gemit says it's a messenger bag.
8310640	8314440	Wait for a bundle with a design that you really, really like and then buy that whatever it
8314440	8315680	is, 2D or 3D.
8315680	8319040	There is a Pokemon 3DS XL for what it's worth, red and blue one.
8319040	8321560	Or have wonderful, wonderful friends like Slidekick.
8321560	8323560	There you go.
8323560	8324560	Thank you so much.
8324560	8326520	That's the only reason I have a 3DS.
8326520	8327520	Thank you for feeding my addiction.
8327520	8328520	I love you.
8328520	8329520	What a nice boy.
8329520	8330520	Yes.
8330520	8331520	You get cookies.
8331520	8332520	Hey, OLR.
8332520	8336280	Before I go into the meat of my email, I thought I'd update my situation with Gamerscape.
8336280	8338160	This is Rossdale, UT.
8338160	8342040	I tried to file a complaint against them with the BBB, but they didn't seem to have a site
8342040	8346760	listed in their business and I couldn't find the address or the like, which seems to be
8346760	8350960	required when submitting a complaint about a business the BBB is unaware of.
8350960	8355600	All I could get is that they're in Stockholm, Sweden, and I'm not going to burn a charge
8355600	8356680	back over $10.
8356680	8359160	I'm not sure what, if anything, I can do about this.
8359160	8363360	I'm probably just out of luck and left telling anyone who will listen to avoid that piss
8363360	8365360	hole of a site.
8365360	8367800	You're using opinions expressed by the emailer.
8367800	8368800	You're not necessarily...
8368800	8369800	Well...
8369800	8370800	I don't know this site at all.
8370800	8376280	But there are businesses that do keep foreign addresses to precisely not have to answer.
8376800	8382200	Good on him for following up and putting his angry pen where his mouth is, so to speak.
8382200	8383200	Well, no.
8383200	8388680	You know, what was the thing that I used to quote from some study that I did in customer
8388680	8390120	service actually?
8390120	8396280	That out of every eight people with a complaint, only one will be an advocate.
8396280	8398040	That means only one person will do something about it.
8398040	8400760	So thank you for being an advocate.
8400760	8404520	Anyway, enough of those cancers on gaming.
8404520	8405520	Wow.
8405760	8408600	Someone asked me if I considered Desura my happy alternative.
8408600	8412400	Unlike many, I don't have a real preference when it comes to services other than they
8412400	8414160	offer DRM free games.
8414160	8420040	Desura is DRM agnostic, meaning they'll put games that publishers are absolutely adamant
8420040	8421040	about DRM.
8421040	8425180	However, they do make sure to let you know that if you're getting a game that needs DRM,
8425180	8426340	so I know what to avoid.
8426340	8430500	I just wish I could filter out DRM titles in search.
8430500	8435460	Other sites I use are Indie Game Stand, GOG, and Humble Bundle.
8435460	8438740	Also I've just recently discovered that if a site is selling their game with the Humble
8438740	8443520	widget, it can be linked to your Humble Bundle account, which greatly expands my options.
8443520	8447900	I found a place called Bundle in a Box, and I haven't known of them long enough to see
8447900	8450700	a bundle I want from them, but I'll get back to you on that.
8450700	8456340	I've also looked at Dotemu, which seems to be a GOG-like service, so I'll be giving them
8456340	8457340	a try when I can.
8457340	8460380	Basically, I'll go wherever to get my PC games DRM free.
8460380	8461940	So that's my answer to Rob's question.
8461940	8464660	Anyway, I hope you guys don't mind my whining.
8464860	8467340	I like that he had an answer to the question, so thank you.
8467340	8474340	To go back to the whole Gamersgate thing, if you do a Whois search on them, just type
8474340	8479940	Whois in Google, type in their URL when it pops up on the GoDaddy site, it'll give you
8479940	8482060	their address right there.
8482060	8487740	But as he said, Stockholm, Sweden, the actual company's name is apparently Paradox Interactive
8487740	8489060	AB.
8489060	8492900	There's also Lupia AB, and various other things.
8492900	8495620	But yeah, definitely registered overseas.
8495620	8497740	Someone out of BBB reach.
8497740	8503380	Also, PS, when are you going to include the forums in your Frugal Question of the Week?
8503380	8506620	I, for one, don't like social media networks.
8506620	8511060	That's a fair question, but honestly, our forums have not been very active at vognetwork.com,
8511060	8514820	and I just kind of think, I don't know, I wonder if maybe forums in general just aren't
8514820	8517220	really a thing these days.
8517220	8519780	What in general would get people to participate more in the forums?
8519780	8522180	Change it to a BBS.
8523180	8528060	I am all for setting up a vognetwork BBS, where we could play games like Legend of the
8528060	8529060	Red Dragon.
8529060	8532420	Actually, I would so be down for that, that would be awesome, but that has nothing to
8532420	8536940	do with a frickin' PHP BB, so I don't know.
8536940	8541020	I mean, I guess the obvious answer is, well, Rob, try posting that on the forums and see
8541020	8542020	what happens.
8542020	8543020	Or...
8543020	8547180	I'm also going to be honest, most of the questions I think of the day of the show, and a large
8547180	8551160	part of that is that we don't always know all the news until the day of the show.
8551160	8554120	So you wouldn't have a lot of time, and that's one concern I have.
8554120	8559640	And Facebook and Google, whether you love them or hate them, are always very immediate.
8559640	8563640	You see, you know, people check their news feed all the time and so forth, so that's
8563640	8565200	what makes it attractive.
8565200	8569760	However, as a suggestion, and I myself am doing something similar, if you happen to
8569760	8575760	see something from a Frugal Question of the Week, and you feel would make a good personal
8575760	8578400	editorial, why not try to submit some content?
8578400	8579400	Oh yeah.
8579640	8582920	You know, send us an article if you have something to say about something that's been a Frugal
8582920	8583920	Question.
8583920	8588800	And, you know, assuming it's not full of, you know, accusing too many people or companies
8588800	8593000	of being cancers on gaming, we might publish it.
8593000	8598840	You know, we do want a little bit more diplomacy in things on our site.
8598840	8600200	And Black Wolf does have a good point.
8600200	8601840	You get more than enough answers anyway.
8601840	8604000	Like tonight, we just had too many answers to read.
8604000	8608840	I'd still be reading them right now, which, don't get me wrong, love you guys for participating,
8608840	8612800	but you know, part of it is too that I want everybody to be able to go read all the answers
8612800	8615840	themselves and just hear me rattle them off.
8615840	8617400	And three hour show.
8617400	8618400	Yes.
8618400	8619400	A three hour show.
8619400	8620400	Sometimes four.
8620400	8621800	A three hour show with news and not.
8621800	8622800	I don't know, Jason.
8622800	8623800	8.30, 8.35.
8623800	8628560	Tonight was, I don't know if you guys, we cut out, there's three less stories tonight
8628560	8631800	because it's such a slow news week, but we filled it other ways.
8631800	8632800	We're chatty.
8632800	8633800	We're chatty people.
8633800	8634800	Well, we do have more email.
8634800	8635800	Yay.
8635800	8636800	Speaking of chatting.
8636800	8637800	Hey guys.
8637800	8638800	Hey.
8638800	8640800	I don't look like a guy.
8640800	8641800	Anyway.
8641800	8645700	I've been listening to Hohler for the past few months every Monday morning at my new
8645700	8646700	grad job.
8646700	8647700	Congrats.
8647700	8651720	I unfortunately cannot join in the live stream often due to being on the east coast.
8651720	8655400	After listening to this week's podcast with the section on crowdfunded games, I was wondering
8655400	8657560	if you guys have looked at Star Citizen.
8657560	8662720	It's a new MMO space sim coming out from Chris Roberts and as of this email, it has raised
8662720	8665720	over 24 million through pure crowdfunding.
8665720	8668760	The game looks like it's going to be amazing and has a ton of backers.
8668760	8674280	Chris Roberts is looking to make a PC game to push the PC to its limit.
8674280	8677860	Check it out at robertspaceindustries.com.
8677860	8680860	So that's robertspaceindustries.com.
8680860	8686000	Anyway, thanks for the podcast and I hope to be able to join the live stream at some
8686000	8687000	point soon.
8687000	8688000	Duron.
8688000	8689000	Oh, I saw that name in chat tonight.
8689000	8690000	So.
8690000	8691000	Hi Duron.
8691000	8692000	I'm glad you're here.
8692000	8693000	And I'm sorry for being disgusting in part A.
8693000	8696720	Like I said, I was channeling extrovert.
8696720	8697720	You're apologizing.
8697720	8700920	Uh, now, uh, I, I, I'm not apologizing.
8700920	8701920	Am I kidding?
8701920	8704760	I did not recognize the game that was being discussed there, but Jason, you raised your
8704760	8705760	hand.
8705760	8706760	You were like, yes, yes.
8706760	8707760	I did.
8707760	8713940	I adore this game because wing commander is one of the few dogfights in space or air.
8713940	8716120	That's been absolute one of my absolute favorite series.
8716120	8718120	Um, for the most part.
8718120	8724280	Um, but Chris Roberts is, you know, every, everybody has, everybody has a one specific
8724280	8728200	individual that a game or a company or somebody is known for in large part.
8728200	8731640	And Chris Roberts is the guy for, uh, wing commander.
8731640	8735800	And so he's creating a space dogfight MMO.
8735800	8737280	No MMO has grabbed me so far.
8737280	8745080	I played, um, both Final Fantasy 11 and WoW to like level eight or nine on my characters.
8745080	8748120	A couple of days worth of playing never really went beyond that.
8748120	8754000	Um, but you know, MMOs have involved, have evolved in insane amount since even, since
8754000	8760340	even WoW came out, um, it's supposed to be full real time space dog fighting with the
8760340	8763120	addition of ships that you can dock on planets.
8763120	8766840	You can land on jump gates to go between galaxies.
8766840	8772520	One of the concepts that was the most interesting to me is that you won't just, it not only
8772520	8775780	is that they're going to make a universe, but the universe is going to continue to grow.
8775780	8777320	It's not going to be this finite thing.
8777320	8782680	There will be additional land, um, universes that you can discover planets that you can
8782680	8783740	travel to.
8783740	8789160	You can play the game passively and be a merchant commander still has a military intent, but
8789160	8791800	you can be like a merchant and do passive things.
8791800	8798640	Or you can be, uh, you know, a pirate or Confederate Raider to go in and do things for your faction.
8798640	8800560	It sounds expansive.
8800560	8801840	It sounds gripping.
8801840	8808880	Um, there were murmurs about Oculus support, which would be unbelievable in a 3d, you know,
8808880	8812640	3d universe of a game when you have, you know, all your controls in front of you in a form
8812640	8816880	of a joystick and however much rudder or anything, throttle, anything else that you have.
8816880	8818720	Um, it has sounded amazing.
8818720	8820680	I am a backer.
8820680	8824040	It's what the, the, the shirt that I got is actually one of the most comfortable shirts
8824040	8826080	I own right now, which is very interesting.
8826080	8830480	Um, but I have my, I have my badge, my ID tag.
8830480	8833480	Um, yeah, it's, it's looked absolutely phenomenal.
8833480	8834480	Hmm.
8834480	8836600	Or at least sometime 2014, sorry.
8836600	8842160	Dungeon buster said in a chat Roberts also did freelancer when he had digital anvil and
8842160	8846400	players essentially turned into a mini MMO with a number of mods added to it over the
8846400	8850920	years and Duran just said Oculus support is confirmed.
8850920	8851920	Nice.
8851920	8852920	Tim Tripp.
8852920	8853920	It sounds like Eve without the spreadsheets.
8853920	8854920	Yes.
8854920	8855920	That is 100% correct.
8856760	8859520	Uh, looking at some other comments in chat real quick, uh, on star citizen, Tim Tripp
8859520	8864040	says a star citizen is the only game I've ever crowdsourced and dungeon buster says
8864040	8866020	star citizen still on the fence with that one.
8866020	8868040	Not too keen on the MMO elements.
8868040	8869400	There you go.
8869400	8871400	I am moving for back into the email land.
8871400	8873400	We have three.
8873400	8878720	Hi, OLR had a fleeting thought the other day about how video games are constantly compared
8878720	8882440	to movies as they seem to be aligning more and more in terms of narrative and visual
8882440	8883440	fidelity.
8883440	8885440	Thank you for using fidelity in an email.
8885960	8888160	That makes me feel, have a little hope.
8888160	8891680	And there is a point of differentiation that I found interesting.
8891680	8896860	If a movie is considered a critical and commercial success, it's typically given many sequels.
8896860	8901480	With this, the original film seems more often than not become viewed as superior and pure
8901480	8903620	version of the franchise as a whole.
8903620	8907520	Why is this not the same with video games that they're so closely connected to films?
8907520	8911160	When a video game enjoys mass success, it is given a sequel and almost instantly original
8911160	8915240	game is rendered obsolete due to the improved build of the game engine, better graphics
8915240	8916440	control, et cetera.
8916440	8917840	Curious to know your thoughts on this.
8917840	8920880	I'm going to put in right now, I'm going to use Mass Effect as my thing, so don't judge
8920880	8921880	me.
8921880	8922880	Okay.
8922880	8926480	First, Mass Effect, better story wise than the later two.
8926480	8927480	Really?
8927480	8930200	I don't agree with that, but okay.
8930200	8934500	I think that it was when you're introducing different writing teams and the story changes
8934500	8937560	dramatically from the direction it was going in.
8937560	8941360	That's when I have some concerns.
8941360	8946160	But as far as playing the game, Mass Effect 3 is lots of fun.
8946160	8951840	I have way much more fun actually just playing the game than I do the first Mass Effect,
8951840	8953600	especially since the Mako makes me want to puke.
8953600	8957760	So if I'm understanding the question right, they want to know when the original is better
8957760	8959200	than the sequel.
8959200	8964280	Because in movies, it tends to be that the original is better than the sequel, right?
8964280	8967520	Very rarely are sequels as good as the original, unless you're talking about like, you know,
8967520	8972960	I don't know, like the Godfather, you know, Star Wars, yeah, well, Star Wars and so on.
8972960	8977840	A lot of times too, that when you have a movie come out, typically sequels are done, I mean,
8977840	8982580	except for when they're planned as trilogies, for example, Star Wars, the only three in
8982580	8987660	existence in my brain, in my universe, head canon.
8987660	8992220	Those tell a good story and they're a cohesive unit.
8992340	8995860	The real bill was intended to be a full movie, right?
8995860	9000300	And the two parts are different enough, but they are a cohesive story.
9000300	9004740	When you have sequels that are made as cash cows, you know, Oh, well, this movie did good.
9004740	9007700	Let's see if we can make some more money, hangover part two and three.
9007700	9008700	Yeah.
9008700	9009700	Right.
9009700	9013420	But, you know, I think like one of the few movies that have actually done that successfully
9013420	9018980	is like the American Pie series, those have all been kind of funny in their own bizarre
9018980	9020180	scream movies.
9020180	9023620	Not everybody likes the sequels as much as I do, but have you actually seen all of the
9023620	9024620	American Pies?
9024620	9027180	I've seen two and part of three.
9027180	9031100	Some of the direct to video ones are awful though.
9031100	9032100	Let's be real.
9032100	9033100	Just saying they exist.
9033100	9035140	Anyway, I did want to watch the band camp.
9035140	9039580	Let's go back to dude's question because, um, it's, or it could be female.
9039580	9044140	I didn't, sorry, but I don't know who, I don't know based on names, if y'all are male or
9044140	9047020	female, it's, it's a traditionally masculine name, but it could go the other way.
9047020	9048020	You never know.
9048060	9053740	Um, so what the emailer, um, said there, I think the question really was, have you played
9053740	9059740	a video game where the sequel was not as good as the original and this is, I almost used
9059740	9061240	this as the kickoff topic tonight.
9061240	9064620	The other one was a little more themed for Halloween, which, you know, but I thought
9064620	9065620	this is a great question too.
9065620	9068540	I was hoping I could hear from the three of you if there are any game series you can think
9068540	9072860	of where you consider the first game to be superior version despite multiple sequels.
9072860	9077940	Yes, I have a, uh, I had to really think about this, but I have a great answer I think for
9077940	9078940	this.
9078940	9084100	Uh, I have to go retro, really retro, but Blaster Master, the original, well, the original
9084100	9086860	was superior to anything that came out after it.
9086860	9088340	Like that horrible Genesis one.
9088340	9090100	But it had a better Japanese game.
9090100	9091660	Was it Space Fight Hyperion?
9091660	9095180	Yeah, but I, I, but Blaster Master was the answer that came to my mind.
9095180	9098300	I don't know if you guys, I had more time to think about it, but you guys.
9098300	9099300	Excite Truck.
9099300	9102100	You're on that kick again.
9102100	9104940	Tim Tripp actually makes a good point and this is something I was going to bring up
9104940	9105940	as well.
9105980	9110500	Typically the first game in a new IP doesn't receive the budget that an established IP.
9110500	9114180	So the big difference that comes in the amount of risk inherent in creating a new IP versus
9114180	9115780	a new movie IP.
9115780	9121140	Uh, I think that is a great point and I think it's very true with games, but to be fair,
9121140	9125420	it's also true to some extent with movies and I would point out those movies that they've
9125420	9130260	made a million of like, um, Saw, as much as I hate those movies, there's that, right?
9130260	9135540	And then there's, um, but, but, but, or sorry, Paranormal Activity.
9135540	9137940	You know, the first one was made for like what, a quarter?
9137940	9141000	Like they smashed some kid's piggy bank and made a movie with the money that was in it.
9141000	9144180	But then the others got like more and more budgets later on.
9144180	9147900	But I, but just, you know, the saw, I get a saw though, they actually do have a story
9147900	9150900	that goes through the whole thing, apparently, although I haven't seen the last movie, but
9150900	9151900	I read the Wiki.
9151900	9154700	I saw them all, but they actually do have a story.
9154700	9158100	Like once you watch them like, Oh, Hey, there actually is something that kind of ties in
9158100	9159100	with all this stuff.
9159100	9160260	I think it's one of those things.
9160260	9162580	Again, I only read it off the Wiki afterwards.
9162580	9163580	Yeah.
9163620	9167140	I only read the Wiki cause I refuse to watch the movies after I saw the first one and that
9167140	9168140	was enough.
9168140	9170700	Just to tell you, Shayne, I actually like Dragon Age 2 better than the first one.
9170700	9171940	So far, so far.
9171940	9178660	Oh, that's a good answer though, to the question, Dragon Age, um, the, the, I did see Saw 1
9178660	9179660	for whoever asked in chat.
9179660	9181860	I saw Saw 1, I refuse to watch any of the others.
9181860	9185320	I have a feeling that they always knew how it was going to end.
9185320	9187620	And I think they, they tied it together that way.
9187620	9189300	They always knew how it was going to end.
9189660	9193620	You know, there's a, and actually I thought about it, but someone in chat mentioned it
9193620	9194620	too.
9194620	9196220	Um, Android, is that Alan?
9196220	9197460	It's Alan on his phone.
9197460	9198460	He's on light rail right now.
9198460	9200980	Devil May Cry.
9200980	9202460	The first one was better.
9202460	9204540	In my opinion, I liked it a lot better.
9204540	9209060	Um, I can, I am also tempted to say Silent Hill.
9209060	9213380	I think in some ways the first game is superior to anything that came after it.
9213380	9215420	It's limitations actually made it creepier.
9215460	9220580	However, Silent Hill 2 is kind of the, the climax of that whole series.
9220580	9223660	And that was, I mean, yes, that's a sequel, but how many Silent Hills have there been
9223660	9224660	after that?
9224660	9225660	Too many.
9225660	9226660	Oh, no, no.
9226660	9228100	There've only been a few Silent Hill games.
9228100	9229100	The others are fakes.
9229100	9230100	Yeah.
9230100	9231100	Anyway.
9231100	9232500	They don't exist in my, in my universe.
9232500	9233740	That was a fantastic question.
9233740	9238380	I would actually invite, um, if, uh, you know, we do comments on this show every week at
9238380	9244060	vognetwork.com and I'd really invite you if you want to leave a comment and if your answer's
9244060	9247780	good, I will get, or like, you know, of course, Shane pipes in.
9247780	9251380	I'll be very easy on you with this, but, um, I'll give you a thumbs up guaranteed.
9251380	9254500	So you get a little point on vognetwork.com.
9254500	9257940	If you have an answer to this question, leave it on the episode posting at vognetwork.com
9257940	9258940	for you podcast listeners.
9258940	9263660	Cause I want to know what games do you believe had better initial games than the sequels?
9263660	9267500	See Shane ranks the Silent Hill games as two, four, one, three.
9267500	9268500	I beg to differ.
9268500	9269500	Hmm.
9269500	9270500	Three, two, four, one.
9270500	9271500	Now take that.
9271500	9272500	Three, two, one, four.
9272900	9278900	Shane, Shane, admittedly, you value the room way more than a lot of people do.
9278900	9280740	The room wasn't supposed to be a Silent Hill game.
9280740	9281740	Oh, remember?
9281740	9282740	Anyway.
9282740	9286020	I loved the, I liked the room, the three booths that they had for that game.
9286020	9287020	Yeah.
9287020	9288340	That was my first, like the kitchen and everything.
9288340	9289340	Oh my God.
9289340	9290340	That was awesome.
9290340	9292940	So, um, yeah, we still have more email.
9292940	9293940	Yay.
9293940	9296020	This is, we didn't need three extra stories.
9296020	9297980	We've got three extra emails tonight and that's fine.
9297980	9298980	Every gamer gets a voice.
9298980	9299980	Hey guys.
9299980	9300980	Hey guys.
9300980	9301980	Starlock here.
9301980	9302980	Hi Starlock.
9302980	9308740	With Halloween mere days away, I had a question to pose to both the host and listeners.
9308740	9313180	I wanted to know what game you can't finish due to one scene that spoils the rest of the
9313180	9314180	game for you.
9314180	9317500	I'll give you my example near the beginning of Homefront.
9317500	9320500	There's a scene in which the child's parents are killed right in front of him and the child
9320500	9322620	is seen crying for several seconds.
9322620	9326700	Even though I'm fairly certain no other such scenes exist in the game, it completely kills
9326700	9330540	the desire for me to see the rest of the game because that scene is just too disturbing
9330540	9331620	for me to watch.
9331620	9335380	I wanted to know if anyone else had similar experiences with any games out there.
9335380	9336380	Keep being awesome, Starlock.
9336380	9338460	There's a movie that does that for me.
9338460	9341260	I can't watch Face Off.
9341260	9345620	I never played more than Silent, than the start of Silent Hill 4 because the opening
9345620	9350140	cinematic and the ambience just kind of completely creeped me out.
9350140	9354140	I think my head was just kind of in a weird place that afternoon and I think I literally
9354140	9358540	just finished Silent Hill 3 and moved on to Silent Hill 4, but I saw the opening cinematic
9358540	9361340	which did the whole world shifting.
9361340	9365580	I did start the game, I did get control, I went to the window and I looked outside and
9365580	9371140	saw the other apartment across the way, whatever, but I never touched the game beyond that because
9371140	9377900	for whatever reason the ambience just seemed too much for my brain and I put it down and
9377900	9381540	never picked it back up again.
9381540	9385300	If my name was Bobby Blackwell, I might say, well, I played the demo to Ni No Kuni and
9385300	9389740	then that scared me off for the rest of the game.
9389740	9393100	I can only think of a funny answer because I can't think of a serious one because I didn't
9393100	9394100	see this email in advance.
9394100	9396660	It must have come in late.
9396660	9397660	I really don't know.
9397660	9398660	A game where a scene...
9398660	9401180	Does it have to be disturbing or just it was bad?
9401180	9403540	Like there was something so bad happen?
9403540	9404540	Question.
9404540	9407460	Well, disturbing, bad, something that affected you in a way that made you not want to finish
9407460	9410900	it.
9410900	9414540	It's like me in the scene in legend that I can't get past and have never finished the
9414540	9415540	movie.
9415540	9416540	Oh yeah.
9416540	9417540	You know what I'm talking about?
9417540	9418540	Yeah, I know I do.
9418540	9423120	And I'm trying to think if I have anything that's kind of like trigger-ish like that.
9423120	9425580	And for the record, I don't think I could play the game for exactly the same reason
9425580	9428820	because it's kind of a very horrible thing for me.
9428820	9429900	I can't think of something.
9429900	9433780	If I think of something, I'll have to answer it on VOG Network or something because I really
9433780	9434780	can't think of anything.
9434780	9437240	Loki, can you think of anything that...
9437240	9439960	When you put in the Excitebots and found it wasn't it's like track?
9439960	9447480	Yeah, it was the first Mexico track and you're playing it and then the game asks you to throw
9447480	9448640	a pie at a clown.
9448640	9452680	I was like, what the fuck is this?
9452680	9455960	I can't think of anything that's really had a scene in the game that kind of ruined it
9455960	9456960	for me.
9456960	9463800	I can think of a lot of games where you play through it and the end is like kind of lame.
9463800	9465200	And that kind of ruined it for me.
9465200	9467040	It's like, shit, why did I play this game?
9467040	9469800	This ending is fucking terrible.
9469800	9473000	But no, I can't think of anything that's like there's been something in the middle of the
9473000	9476520	game, like a story thing where it just kind of went, what?
9476520	9477720	I don't like this.
9477720	9481160	I'm going to quit this game.
9481160	9483940	Tim Tripp in chat says, I watched The Descent once.
9483940	9487040	It was amazing, but I can never watch it again.
9487040	9490800	I've definitely seen a lot of movies like that where it's like, I'm glad I saw it once
9490800	9492440	and I will never watch that again.
9492440	9495580	I have a movie I can say I wasn't glad that I saw it even though I didn't have to pay
9495580	9496580	for it.
9496620	9497620	And that was Drag Me to Hell.
9497620	9499420	I went with Tiara to see it.
9499420	9500420	She loved it.
9500420	9503020	I just thought it was gross and not very good.
9503020	9504900	Watched movie 43 the other day.
9504900	9509180	Very disappointed that that movie was not funny or it wasn't as.
9509180	9511980	They showed you all the funny stuff in the trailer.
9511980	9516980	It did have a cameo, though, of Band Fuse, a game that will unfortunately sorely fail
9516980	9520380	when it comes out in November, but it had a cameo.
9520380	9522380	So there's a bullet point for that.
9522380	9524660	I'm trying to see if the chatters have any.
9524660	9526420	They're still doing the Silent Hill debate in chat.
9526420	9529940	There's not a lot of comments on it, but Dungeon Buster does say I couldn't get past
9529940	9532940	the bad full motion video acting in a PC game once.
9532940	9535940	Well, the gameplay was also pretty terrible, too, but he didn't say what game it was.
9535940	9537980	So I don't know.
9537980	9541460	But chatters, if you have any answers to it, let us know.
9541460	9544860	There was a game that I remember playing for a while that had something that made me super
9544860	9547900	nauseous and I couldn't touch the game for a little while.
9547900	9548900	But then I went back.
9548900	9554380	I mean, I've had things that they just shake me up right away and I'd have trouble finishing
9554380	9556220	the scene.
9556220	9560660	And then once I'd digested it for a few days, I could go back and play it and be fine.
9560660	9561860	But I can't remember the last one.
9561860	9567140	I kind of didn't like the beginning of Alone in the Dark, the original Alone in the Dark,
9567140	9568860	because it was hard.
9568860	9569860	That's about it.
9569860	9570860	I don't know.
9570860	9571860	Once again, nothing content-related.
9571860	9577500	I mean, fuck, there was the torture scene Grand Theft Auto 5 and I was just like, how
9577500	9583140	do I gold this thing because I don't want to have to play this boring minigame again.
9584140	9587260	Oh yeah, that's kind of brutal too, I guess.
9587260	9588260	All right.
9588260	9590700	Well, if I think of something later, I'll let you know.
9590700	9591700	That was a good question, though.
9591700	9592700	Okay.
9592700	9593700	Last email.
9593700	9594700	I believe it's last.
9594700	9596060	It's the last, as far as I'm concerned.
9596060	9597060	Last for tonight.
9597060	9598460	Hi folks, it's Raginator.
9598460	9603100	Seeing as tonight's episode is the last one before Halloween is spelled with an A, dude.
9603100	9604100	Halloween.
9604100	9605100	Halloween.
9605100	9607180	You spelled it twice.
9607180	9609620	You spelled it Halloween.
9609620	9612620	Hollow Man is a very good, okay.
9613100	9614100	It's a movie that came to me.
9614100	9615100	I thought I'd send out Halloween.
9615100	9617100	It is All Hallows Eve.
9617100	9618100	Hallo.
9618100	9619100	Hallo.
9619100	9624340	I know that since we're all pretty much in the same age group, around 35 plus or minus
9624340	9627420	six years, we don't...
9627420	9628420	We are, Raginator.
9628420	9630300	I don't know about the listeners, but okay.
9630300	9632020	We all don't go trick or treating anymore.
9632020	9633020	Yes, we do.
9633020	9634020	And haven't done so in years.
9634020	9635020	Yes, we have.
9635020	9636020	Fuck that shit.
9636020	9638440	The Disneyland party is off the hook.
9638440	9642580	And for the record, some of us might have kids, so they go trick or treating.
9642580	9643580	With their kids.
9643580	9645580	Who do you think eats all the candy in the middle of the night?
9645580	9646580	Mom!
9646580	9647580	Loki.
9647580	9648580	I don't eat all the candy.
9648580	9649580	I just go to Becky's house and take Julian's.
9649580	9650580	My wife would be in there.
9650580	9654120	I mean, Becky, if you're listening, I'm not going to steal Julian's candy.
9654120	9656220	If you're listening, I'm not going to take Julian's candy.
9656220	9657220	Yes.
9657220	9658220	No.
9658220	9659660	Besides, they keep giving him those stupid peanut butter cups.
9659660	9662280	Those things fucking suck.
9662280	9663280	My opinion, of course.
9663280	9664280	Everyone else likes peanut butter cups.
9664280	9665280	I know.
9665280	9666280	I know whatever.
9666280	9667280	Everyone else likes that shit, but not me.
9667280	9669100	And to continue, God, you keep misspelling Halloween.
9669100	9670740	God, this is fucking irritating.
9670740	9673940	But we may have certain Halloween traditions.
9673940	9676420	For me, it's watching movies that would be Halloween appropriate.
9676420	9678100	Alien, Aliens, Monster Squad.
9678100	9679820	God, I fucking love the Monster Squad.
9679820	9680820	Showgirls.
9680820	9681820	Girl.
9681820	9682820	Fist bump.
9682820	9683820	Ghostbusters, etc.
9683820	9685820	You are a whore, darlin'.
9685820	9687420	Y'all know shit.
9687420	9692620	I could do the hand thing, but I'm holding a mic.
9692620	9694500	And the same goes with games.
9694500	9696620	Nightmare Creatures, Resident Evil 1-3-3, blah.
9696620	9697620	I mean, etc.
9697620	9703860	Now my question for you is, do you do anything at all similar?
9703860	9708100	I sit at home and throw candy at kids.
9708100	9709580	I don't know about this year.
9709580	9711260	We're going to something.
9711260	9715140	I know a lot of people did their Halloween party this weekend, like last night, but we
9715140	9719500	got invited to one that's after Halloween, so we're doing that, and my costume that we
9719500	9722440	bought the other day is for that.
9722440	9726780	But I don't know about on Halloween itself this year.
9726940	9728940	Maybe I'll try to invite some people over to watch Showgirls.
9728940	9729940	It'll be fun.
9729940	9731700	Or I'll go to Jamie's.
9731700	9732700	You know what?
9732700	9733700	I seriously want to do that.
9733700	9735340	You're not doing anything on Halloween, right?
9735340	9736700	Is your thing on Halloween?
9736700	9737700	Not yet.
9737700	9738700	No, it's on, like, the second.
9738700	9739700	That's at Showgirls' party at my house.
9739700	9740700	Fuck yes.
9740700	9743700	We'll just push everything out of the room.
9743700	9747100	Can I bring over a kiddie pool and we'll reenact the pool scene with the cats?
9747100	9748100	Yes!
9748100	9749100	I don't know.
9749100	9750100	Midna might bite me.
9750100	9751100	I don't.
9751100	9752100	Alright.
9752100	9758220	No, but, actually, I'm totally down for Showgirls at my house on Halloween.
9758220	9760620	You really shouldn't throttle cats like that.
9760620	9761620	With mimosas.
9761620	9762620	Rob.
9762620	9765620	Well, I have to drive home, but.
9765620	9767420	I have a couch.
9767420	9769100	I gotta work on Friday, girl.
9769100	9770100	Girl.
9770100	9771100	No.
9771100	9774060	Okay, we have mimosas early and then you can, you know, work it off doing the hand wave.
9774060	9775060	Alright, alright, read the email.
9775060	9776060	Two things.
9776060	9777060	That was the email.
9777060	9778060	Two random thoughts I just had here.
9778060	9779060	Sure.
9779060	9780060	Why not?
9780060	9781060	Both Showgirls, really.
9781100	9784180	Any sort of Kickstarter related game that has to do with Showgirls.
9784180	9788820	Perhaps like, you know, a WarioWare type situation where you have all these different mini games
9788820	9790500	that have to do with Showgirls.
9790500	9794820	And two, I just thought, remember they have that really retarded jib-jab type or whatever
9794820	9796220	where you can put your face on stuff?
9796220	9799460	They really need to put scenes from Showgirls in there where you can just put your face
9799460	9800460	on those characters.
9800460	9801460	That'd be hilarious.
9801460	9802460	Oh my god.
9802460	9803460	You know what I just remembered?
9803460	9804460	It would be leotardid.
9804460	9805460	Lowkey.
9805460	9806460	You know what I just remembered?
9806460	9807460	Totally leotardid.
9807460	9808460	You know all I know about jib-jab?
9808460	9809460	Uh huh.
9809460	9810460	Is that this land thing that was made with Romney and Bush?
9810860	9813460	I don't see those god-awful Christmas cards singing elf things on Facebook.
9813460	9815020	I don't look at that shit.
9815020	9819360	The management at my work think those are so clever.
9819360	9820360	Every fucking year.
9820360	9824020	All I know of jib-jab is the year that they did this land featuring, um, not Romney, what
9824020	9825020	I'm saying.
9825020	9828180	Um, who was the guy that ran against Bush that we all knew would lose?
9828180	9829180	Gore?
9829180	9830180	No.
9830180	9831180	Um, John Kerry.
9831180	9832180	John Kerry.
9832180	9834180	You're the guy who, like, an int.
9834180	9835180	Yes.
9835180	9836180	Yeah.
9836180	9837180	Um, yeah.
9837180	9838180	That was pretty funny.
9838180	9839180	Alright.
9839220	9843220	I'm going to chatroom at live.vognetware.com, uh, Tim Tripp suggests a Kinect-based showgirls
9843220	9844220	dance game.
9844220	9847540	Uh, D'Artezia said, do they do shadowcasts of showgirls?
9847540	9848540	Just wondering.
9848540	9849540	No.
9849540	9852980	And by the way, this is like the third time this year showgirls has come up on the show,
9852980	9854420	which has nothing to do with video games.
9854420	9857920	I guess that's what makes our show unique, if you can tolerate this chat.
9857920	9861540	But I will entertain this question because the one thing I look forward to every year
9861540	9867600	in August is at the Castro Theater in San Francisco, California, the drag queen peaches
9867640	9873440	Christ and her, yes, that's her name, peaches Christ and her crew put on a midnight showing
9873440	9875720	or no, I guess it's the peaches Christ midnight mass.
9875720	9878220	I guess they bumped it up a little bit cause we're all getting older.
9878220	9883660	It's more like this 8 p.m. showing of showgirls and the bitch comes out of a volcano and they
9883660	9886180	all do the dance to goddess and the whole thing.
9886180	9888600	And then they do free lap dances with large popcorn.
9888600	9892080	And for like the past four or five years, um, Alan and I have been going religiously
9892080	9893080	this thing.
9893080	9894480	I want to go with you guys next year.
9894480	9895480	You came one time.
9895480	9897360	I came once, but I didn't get to go this last year.
9897360	9902520	I went the year before because we went to a sausage factory, which is a restaurant in
9902520	9903520	the Castro.
9903520	9904520	Go figure.
9904520	9908840	But yes, uh, I pretty much live for that day of the year because I love showgirls and by
9908840	9913600	the way, Elizabeth Berkeley on dancing with the stars watching me live.
9913600	9916280	Did you see the I'm so excited dance?
9916280	9917280	I know, right?
9917280	9918280	I don't even watch that show.
9918280	9919280	And I watched that.
9919280	9921360	Oh, I was like, even Loki saw it.
9921360	9922360	You didn't see it.
9922360	9923360	Oh, she did.
9923360	9925240	You remember saved by the bell, right?
9925240	9928880	I didn't even watch saved by the bell and I know that she did a dance related to that
9928880	9930400	and they actually like had scenery.
9930400	9931400	Yeah.
9931400	9932880	She was taking, she was ODing on jive pills.
9932880	9934520	It was great.
9934520	9936360	And the dance was of course the jive.
9936360	9943080	Although I will say this, the best person to ever do the jive on that show was, um,
9943080	9944080	Stacy Keebler.
9944080	9948760	Just saying, I'll have to look it up, I guess.
9948760	9949760	All right.
9949760	9951640	Uh, is that it for mailbag?
9951640	9952640	It is for now.
9952640	9953640	All right.
9953640	9954640	Then there you go.
9955040	9958320	The next part of the show with the FUs of the week, we get a little angst out of our
9958320	9959320	system.
9959320	9960320	Why?
9960320	9961320	Because
9961320	9983880	FU to my state of unemployment again, I'm, I really want this job that I interviewed
9983880	9988560	for, it seems like such a great match.
9988560	9989840	I hate getting my hopes up too.
9989840	9996160	So FU to getting my hopes up because the last few times I've been pretty dashed, but I,
9996160	9999120	I feel really positively, I haven't heard anything back yet.
9999120	10006840	So FU to the anticipation, FU to the waiting room, and I really, really want this to be
10006840	10007840	successful.
10007840	10009480	I'd really like this job.
10009480	10011480	It would be perfect.
10011480	10012520	Perfect.
10012520	10018400	And also FU to getting oil paint all over my arm and looking like I've punched a wall.
10018400	10026280	I'm painting, um, a portrait in purple and blue or violet and blue and blue violet.
10026280	10031120	And I got blue and blue violet all over my right arm going down the bone and it looked
10031120	10034520	like I had just hit a wall with the side of my arm.
10034520	10038600	So FU to oil paint as well.
10038600	10040280	And Rob just came up with a nephew.
10040280	10045620	Yeah, I'm going next because I, I will FU to the headache that I just went to the bathroom
10045620	10049600	to get Advil for my headache and then FU to the fact that I stubbed my toe on the way
10049600	10050600	back.
10050600	10051600	It fucking hurts.
10051600	10052600	Do you want ice?
10052600	10053600	No.
10053600	10054600	Kiss it, make it better.
10054600	10055600	Eh.
10055600	10056600	Loki, what's your FU?
10056600	10058680	We'll get the kitty to kiss it.
10058680	10059960	Kitty kisses make it all better.
10059960	10062160	She's hiding under the bed cause she hates people.
10062160	10067940	My FU goes to the city of Folsom and their wonderful event that they had on Friday, their
10067940	10071800	Night of a Thousand Pumpkins, which I, see I don't go down the old Folsom because it's
10071800	10077820	like this hipster, you know, historic area that they do events in and stuff like that.
10077820	10080300	What a bunch of douche bags coming out of there.
10080300	10085100	Anyways, but seriously though, they had their thing and see I, I don't do that, but free
10085100	10087000	trick or treating and stuff like that.
10087000	10089420	They charge parking down there.
10089420	10094160	Normally the parking garage is free, but they charge $2 parking for charity.
10094160	10098860	The charity happens to be the Folsom Historic Society, basically they run this really shitty
10098860	10102440	museum that they have down there that no one fucking goes to and is closed every time I
10102440	10103440	go down there.
10103440	10108360	So fuck them for that because then I had to go, I had to first off look for parking that
10108360	10109740	didn't cost any money.
10109740	10114880	Then I had to drive across the bridge to a gas station to use an ATM to get fucking money
10114880	10120960	to pay their stupid fee to then park on the roof of this stupid, it was just terrible.
10121000	10123800	And the event sucked on top of all of that.
10123800	10128000	So you did just give an F you to a $2 charity donation you had to make?
10128000	10129000	Yes.
10129000	10131000	Just making sure.
10131000	10132000	Jason!
10132000	10137200	F you to myself for not just, for not being able to just get on a fricking plane.
10137200	10143720	It's not hard to get around places and save me a hell of a lot of time in grief.
10143720	10147960	I don't mind driving, but some days, whatever.
10148960	10151960	Um, and there was a second one.
10151960	10154960	F you to money in general.
10154960	10155960	I hear that.
10155960	10156960	I hear that.
10156960	10159960	All right, there it is, the F yous of the week.
10159960	10160960	So angsty, so fresh.
10160960	10161960	All right.
10161960	10163960	Uh, just a few more stories for you guys.
10163960	10167960	An F you to misspelling Halloween.
10167960	10169960	Poor Ragenator, but then again, we've been picking on that guy forever.
10169960	10170960	We still love you, Ragenator.
10170960	10174960	Bones did it too, but I'm just being, I just use it as a launch.
10174960	10176960	Blame autocorrect.
10176960	10177960	That's what people do.
10177960	10178960	All right.
10178960	10180960	How is that even an autocorrect thing?
10180960	10182960	Because it's misspelled.
10182960	10183960	Shouldn't autocorrect catch that?
10183960	10184960	Calm down, Lee.
10184960	10189760	That would be hilarious to like change someone's autocorrect to like wrong stuff.
10189760	10190760	It learns.
10190760	10191760	Dude.
10191760	10192760	Yeah.
10192760	10197140	My phone knows like when I start to type L-U-V, it goes, love you, mean it.
10197140	10198760	Like it knows that that's a word.
10198760	10201160	I want to know how my iPad gets all these things wrong.
10201160	10203160	It knows fuckery as a word now.
10203160	10205160	My phone knows and ass hattery.
10206160	10210160	By the way, I have to go with Quincemia down with capitalism.
10210160	10215160	I will say my phone always picks either we're or were wrong and it's actually kind of really
10215160	10216160	annoying.
10216160	10220160	I do have OMW turn automatically into on my way.
10220160	10221160	Everybody does by default.
10221160	10223160	Jason, some flight advice from Shane.
10223160	10224160	I changed the punctuation.
10224160	10227160	From Shane Olinko in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.
10227160	10230160	Jason, if you're afraid to fly, ask for vodka on the plane.
10230160	10234160	I told a flight attendant I was scared and she gave me vodka and orange juice and it
10234160	10236160	made the flight super fun.
10238160	10243160	I've gotten a lot of similar remedy ideas that and well, I'm sure we can fill in the
10243160	10244160	blank.
10244160	10249160	Doesn't one of those airlines like Virgin Air or one of them does like a fear of flying
10249160	10253160	school or something where you can actually take these classes where they will help cure
10253160	10254160	you of your fear of flying.
10254160	10255160	Interesting.
10255160	10257160	And you live, you don't live that far from Denver, right?
10257160	10258160	Right.
10258160	10259160	That's where Frontiers Hub is.
10259160	10262160	And they're one of those companies that I would imagine would have something like that.
10262160	10263160	Check it out.
10263160	10265160	You know what the best flight I've ever had was?
10265160	10269160	Was a Southwest flight where it was me and Julie.
10269160	10276160	We were going to Las Vegas and we got on there and they like totally didn't give a fuck when
10276160	10278160	they were doing the flight safety.
10278160	10279160	Sounds like Southwest.
10279160	10283160	It's like, and if you have any questions, please hesitate to answer.
10283160	10286160	If you find the plane going down, you better hold on to your ass because we're going to
10286160	10287160	die.
10288160	10295160	You can see people like, Oh, and like, and then everyone else is like laughing so hard.
10295160	10298160	The people that got scared were embarrassed into laughing with them.
10298160	10300160	And then the guy says, just kidding.
10300160	10303160	That's like 98 percent.
10303160	10305160	What's our statistics?
10305160	10306160	It was great.
10306160	10309160	That's the best flight I've ever been on.
10309160	10311160	You just need liquor and pills, Jason.
10311160	10312160	It makes it easier.
10312160	10313160	All right.
10313160	10314160	Moving on.
10314160	10316160	You know what, though?
10316160	10320160	I, some people don't have the patience to do the drive or the train or anything like
10320160	10321160	that.
10321160	10326160	So, you know, at least you get to see such beautiful parts of the country as Elko, Nevada,
10326160	10330160	and all of Southern Wyoming across and the no tell motels.
10330160	10336160	Did we know the whole thing about flight is, you know, trying to say is going to the bathroom
10336160	10338160	on the plane worthwhile.
10338160	10343160	Do I need to get out of my window seat to go pee or can I hold it?
10343160	10345160	Always go to the bathroom on the plane.
10345160	10347160	You're never going to see those people again in your entire life.
10347160	10350160	And, Gamet, there's a way for a plane to have Fireball on it.
10350160	10352160	You get the little, um...
10352160	10354160	You mean the liquor, not the...
10354160	10355160	The liquor.
10355160	10356160	Yes.
10356160	10357160	Thank you.
10357160	10363160	They do have these little flasks that are disguised as tampons.
10363160	10364160	I kid you not.
10364160	10366160	They're actually for yachts, but...
10366160	10369160	Speaking of things you do because you'll never see the other people on the plane ever again.
10369160	10372160	This is a video game show, right?
10372160	10374160	We will talk about that at some point.
10374160	10377160	We just said this was a slow news week.
10377160	10378160	Fuck it.
10378160	10379160	We're filling space.
10379160	10380160	True.
10380160	10381160	True.
10381160	10383160	This is our new version of the fuck it show.
10383160	10384160	All right.
10384160	10386160	We got to get to phone calls too.
10386160	10389160	Loki's got one more story for us and then we're going to get to the phone calls.
10389160	10393160	1-877-GAMO-LR, username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
10393160	10394160	Loki, what do you have for us?
10394160	10396160	So I guess Second Life is happening soon.
10396160	10397160	November 2nd.
10397160	10399160	You mean Extra Life?
10399160	10401160	Extra Life, whatever.
10401160	10403160	Yeah, okay.
10403160	10405160	So yes, Extra Life.
10405160	10408160	And November 2nd.
10408160	10413160	So donate, sponsor people, do all that fun stuff.
10413160	10418160	Ah, it's this weekend for the Children's Miracle Network.
10418160	10426160	I think it's great that this charity kind of has really embraced this whole thing and kind of really made it one of their highlight fundraisers of the year.
10426160	10431160	I don't know if you've seen this, but on PlayStation 3 they actually have an ad for Extra Life right now.
10431160	10434160	And if you raise certain amounts of money you get PlayStation rewards with that.
10434160	10437160	So I thought that was really cool that it all kind of integrates together.
10437160	10440160	So, awesome.
10440160	10441160	All right.
10441160	10443160	Good luck to those of you doing Extra Life, by the way.
10443160	10448160	I'd love to do it, but my wife wouldn't let me have 25 hours of pure gaming.
10448160	10453160	We need to do something charity related, but I would really love to.
10453160	10456160	I have things to tell you offline regarding.
10456160	10460160	I would suggest, you know, we'll probably do the MS Walk again with Horde House next year.
10460160	10462160	And I'd really like OLR to get involved with that too.
10462160	10464160	Maybe we can raise a ton of money for a great cause.
10464160	10465160	So we'll look at that.
10465160	10468160	But for now, Extra Life, good luck to those of you doing it.
10468160	10471160	And yeah, I'll have to watch some of those streams myself.
10471160	10475160	All right, we're going to go right into phone calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
10475160	10478160	We're going to skip what I had on the show roll because I had this.
10478160	10481160	It was a Twitter news story and it ain't even worth it.
10481160	10486160	And the more I think about it, my eyes roll so far back in the back of my head, I can see my brain.
10486160	10490160	If you are dying to know what I was going to report on, that whole Sessler Gate thing.
10490160	10491160	That's all I'm going to say.
10491160	10493160	I don't even know what you're talking about.
10493160	10495160	I have no idea what that is.
10495160	10496160	Well, here I go.
10496160	10498160	No, it's perfect. Call it done.
10498160	10500160	Let's talk about it. Come on.
10500160	10501160	We do have a call.
10501160	10502160	And we'll talk about how ridiculous it is.
10502160	10503160	Okay, quickly.
10503160	10510160	He's whining on Twitter because supposedly there is something about the new console that's going to make it hard to do his job.
10510160	10513160	Like some big thing that isn't announced yet.
10513160	10516160	And it's not Xbox One, it's PlayStation 4.
10516160	10517160	That's all been deduced.
10517160	10525160	This is Reddit, Twitter, all these folks running NeoGaf and they've all got threads on it today.
10525160	10527160	And nobody really knows what it is.
10527160	10534160	And some of the popular thoughts are that perhaps Sony has invoked what Nintendo did earlier this year on YouTube.
10534160	10538160	Where there's going to be that restriction where they're not going to be able to monetize their YouTube videos.
10538160	10541160	Again, thoughts, rumors, speculation.
10541160	10545160	But I don't know if that would be it necessarily.
10545160	10549160	Because I think when Nintendo announced that, nobody got warning about that.
10549160	10550160	That just happened.
10550160	10554160	And that isn't supposed to impact review videos in fair use.
10554160	10561160	My thought is, genuinely, is that it's the PlayStation 4 preview review events.
10561160	10564160	Because it doesn't sound like they're sending out copies of PlayStation 4 games to people.
10564160	10566160	You have to come in and play them.
10566160	10568160	And that's what they do for audio CDs.
10568160	10569160	And a lot of those critics have to do.
10569160	10571160	Why? Piracy.
10571160	10573160	Because people ruined it.
10573160	10578160	And if you have to go somewhere else to play the game, you can't get video in advance.
10578160	10582160	That might ruin your day if you are somebody who does a lot of YouTube video reviews.
10582160	10584160	So, I don't know.
10584160	10587160	It's hard for me to feel sorry.
10587160	10591160	But it certainly is an interesting challenge about the new generation.
10592160	10595160	Whatever. So, there you go. In a nutshell, there's your story.
10595160	10597160	Now we can go to the calls.
10597160	10598160	Yes.
10598160	10599160	1877 Game O.L.R.
10599160	10601160	I saw a Doctor Who icon. You better answer it.
10601160	10603160	I will. Please call. 1877 Game O.L.R.
10603160	10606160	Our username on Skype. Orange Lounge Radio.
10606160	10608160	You can call in now and I will take the call.
10608160	10612160	In the meantime, do we have last minute stories? Probably not tonight.
10612160	10614160	No.
10614160	10615160	We had hardly any stories tonight.
10615160	10617160	I think you just took the last minute story.
10617160	10618160	Yeah. There you go.
10618160	10621160	I did see a couple tweets and they were things worth mentioning.
10621160	10622160	So, I want to get to that.
10622160	10626160	But again, if you want to call 1877 Game O.L.R.
10626160	10628160	Our username on Skype. Orange Lounge Radio.
10628160	10629160	I want Bobby to call.
10629160	10631160	But you excluded him in chat.
10631160	10633160	I didn't exclude him. I said other people.
10633160	10635160	I just said we also want some new people too.
10635160	10636160	Alright.
10636160	10637160	I encourage.
10637160	10639160	Let's get to the phones and see who's there.
10639160	10641160	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
10641160	10643160	Hey, what's up guys? This is Kaijuto.
10643160	10645160	Hey, Kaijuto. What's up? Long time no talk.
10645160	10646160	Hey, Doctor Who icon.
10647160	10653160	Yeah, nothing much. I just wanted to answer the question that one of your listeners proposed to you earlier today.
10653160	10656160	About the. Well, how was it worded?
10656160	10659160	Where you played a game and it was so disturbing that it made you stop.
10659160	10660160	Yes.
10660160	10663160	Yeah, I had a scene that made you just completely not want to play the rest of it.
10663160	10664160	Yes.
10664160	10667160	Yeah, my game is Grand Theft Auto Vice City.
10667160	10672160	There's a mission in that game where I think there's like a mob boss or something.
10672160	10675160	And they want you to kill his wife. They want you to run her off the road.
10676160	10678160	And I couldn't do that for the life of me.
10678160	10682160	Like you, you hear her like literally asking you like, why are you doing this to me?
10682160	10683160	Why are you trying to kill me?
10683160	10688160	It was so disturbing that I turned the game off, never finished it, never played it.
10688160	10690160	And that was back in 2002.
10692160	10698160	You know, it's hard for me to sit here and go, wow, you're so crazy for that answer or something like that.
10698160	10699160	Because I kind of sit here and go.
10699160	10700160	That's pretty admirable.
10700160	10703160	That's. Yeah, you just sound like a nice guy to me.
10703160	10706160	Yeah, I mean, if it was the mob guy would have shot him in the face, no problem.
10706160	10709160	You know, lock him in the, lock him in the trunk, do whatever.
10709160	10713160	But I don't know, it was just the fact that I felt she was an innocent.
10713160	10718160	You know, like when you play Grand Theft Auto, I mean, anyone that you kill in that game, you know, they're usually just criminals.
10718160	10721160	And, you know, they're they're either going to kill you before you kill them.
10721160	10725160	So you kind of you know, you kind of like work that out in your mind that, OK, you know, this is justifiable.
10725160	10728160	But I don't know, just killing that woman wasn't justifiable.
10728160	10732160	I could research and see if she had a meth lab or, you know, a child smuggling ring.
10732160	10736160	Well, well, this was in the 80s, so you were in any meth labs.
10736160	10740160	If anything, she was a cocaine queen or whatever the fuck.
10740160	10753160	You also kind of bring up an interesting point that it's like it's maybe kind of partially the realism of that that really kind of pushed it over the edge for you is that it was a little too realistic because I think like, OK, well, when I play Saints Row four or Saints Row three, excuse me.
10753160	10755160	And I try to run over as many people on the road as I can.
10755160	10758160	That's funny, but it's not realistic.
10758160	10761160	Like, it's totally not realistic or like Armageddon or any of those things.
10761160	10764160	Like it's just it's just cartoon characters. I'm running over my car and it's funny.
10764160	10767160	But like they are not screaming like, please. Oh, God.
10767160	10770160	You know, like they're not like it doesn't get that real.
10770160	10774160	Like it's just funny and like so my brain can easily differentiate.
10774160	10779160	But I can see where like, you know, if this poor innocent woman is screaming her head off, like, please don't kill her.
10779160	10784160	Like, yeah, it's kind of like maybe I maybe I don't want to do this.
10784160	10787160	Yeah, it was exactly that.
10787160	10791160	It was the fact that she was she was screaming and like literally talking to me and asking me why.
10791160	10797160	And, you know, in Grand Theft Auto, you don't you don't talk. So it's like I couldn't really explain to her why.
10797160	10802160	Are you trying to explain from the couch and it's not working.
10802160	10809160	So, well, that is I'm curious enough. Loki remembers that part because he's the big Grand Theft Auto guy.
10809160	10812160	No, I don't remember that.
10812160	10817160	I don't remember if I am that cold blooded man. I don't remember finishing Vice City.
10817160	10823160	I don't know if I ever did. Hmm. Because you didn't really, really get crazy about Grand Theft Auto until just the last one.
10823160	10828160	I think I ever finished three or Vice City. Maybe I did.
10828160	10833160	I don't remember. It was a long time ago. But look, he was looking was rocking out to the music so hard.
10833160	10838160	He didn't even hear the cheat codes. I'm going to blow stuff up. And that's pretty much it.
10838160	10843160	You know, I know I didn't finish Sandra's and I just want to finish it because I mean,
10843160	10847160	I love Vice City. I love the 80s. I mean, I have like a nice vibe to it, but just that part.
10847160	10852160	But I'm going to hang up now. Let some more calls get in.
10852160	10857160	All right. I was talking to you guys again. I'll be calling in more. Sounds good. Good to hear from you.
10857160	10862160	All right. Take care, buddy. Bye. One eight seven seven game oil are his name on Skype, Orange Laundry.
10862160	10866160	Did you get to compliment the doctor who icon? I think you did at the beginning. I did. He did have a doctor who icon.
10866160	10871160	And then the whole time during his phone call, I was playing the old theme since he had the 80s icon.
10871160	10876160	It was classic who not not a new who. Are you going to go to that whole 3D screening of
10876160	10881160	Doctor Who or whatever? I heard about this because I hate people. Oh, that's a fair answer.
10881160	10886160	I hate going to the movies like I don't like going to opening night anything. I don't either.
10886160	10891160	Unless it's like something I'm super excited about. But it's like I have to see the Hunger Games catching fire.
10891160	10896160	I just don't like people that much. I don't blame you. Well, we like this person that's calling in right now.
10896160	10901160	Hi. Are you there? I'm right here and I'm glad you like this person. I do like this person.
10901160	10906160	Hey, Rama. How you doing? I'm doing pretty good. A little tired, but I'm good. Yeah.
10906160	10911160	Was there a con this weekend? No, but I work and now my commute, instead of being
10911160	10916160	from Brooklyn to Midtown Manhattan, is from Brooklyn to Jersey. So three hour commute every single day.
10917160	10922160	Oh my gosh. But I was going to say, as far as the anime cons go too, Halloween is the one time
10922160	10927160	of the year where you're supposed to dress up. So it's like, it's cosplayers vacation.
10927160	10933160	Or as I like to call it, National Cosplayers Day. Fair enough. And you know I'm just teasing you.
10933160	10938160	I'm all for it. What else is on your mind, buddy? Three things and I'll make it quick.
10938160	10944160	Number one, and whereas this is a frugal question of the week, I'll make this part brief.
10944160	10950160	I was playing Bioshock. Going through the level. My old roommate was standing there with his D&D crew.
10950160	10956160	And they watched me play the game. I come to this one section where there is a casket sitting on a shelf.
10956160	10963160	I'm like, okay. I walk over to it. The casket explodes. There are demon, creatures coming at me.
10963160	10968160	I'm killing them and I'm like, what the fuck is this? Holy shit, what the fuck?
10968160	10973160	I kill them all and I'm just staring at the screen. I pause it and I drop the controller and it's like, fuck this.
10973160	10977160	I'm done. Well played, Bioshock. Well played.
10977160	10982160	Well, there you go. That is a scary game that nobody brought up earlier. So, good answer.
10982160	10985160	Yeah, but mind you, I was playing with the lights on.
10988160	10990160	What else is on your mind, buddy?
10990160	10992160	Anyone? Anyone?
10992160	10994160	No, I was just saying, what else is on your mind, buddy?
10994160	11000160	My bad. My bad. Second thing, this was passed to me, someone on my fan page.
11000160	11005160	And they are spreading the words of their Extra Life campaign out of Ohio.
11007160	11017160	The group is called Happy Family and Friends. They're trying to raise $1200 for a local hospital out of Children's Miracle Network Hospital in Ohio.
11017160	11019160	So, I'm just trying to spread the word of that.
11019160	11022160	So, this is a part of the Extra Life, like one of the groups doing it.
11022160	11025160	Okay, awesome. Well, we're all for that, all for charity events.
11025160	11028160	How can we find more information on this? What games are they playing? Do we know?
11028160	11037160	They have not mentioned, but they did say there's going to be a lot of video games, anime, Kevin Smith, crude humor. Did I mention Kevin Smith?
11037160	11041160	Is Kevin Smith going to be there or are they just watching Chasing Amy?
11041160	11044160	Nobody watches Chasing Amy. I thought you knew this.
11044160	11046160	Fuck you, I love that movie.
11046160	11048160	Hey!
11048160	11050160	So, you're a Tracer.
11050160	11054160	I will let you slide on it because you didn't say Jersey Girl.
11054160	11056160	No, God no. Who would say Jersey Girl?
11056160	11058160	At least he didn't raise his hand and ask, what's a Nubian?
11058160	11060160	Oh, what's a Nubian?
11060160	11062160	Shut the fuck up!
11062160	11065160	That's how I incur the wrath of a black man, Rama.
11065160	11067160	Alright.
11067160	11070160	I just like that that whole exchange was staged in the movie. That was great.
11070160	11074160	In all seriousness, what else is on your mind, buddy? You said three things.
11074160	11078160	Yeah, I already told him this. Now, I'm going to let you guys know.
11078160	11088160	As you know, I have this issue with Chain Stop and I refuse to give them my money for the way they treat some of their customers and their products and this and that.
11088160	11090160	Or their employees.
11090160	11092160	Yep, them too.
11092160	11099160	Long story short, old roommate reimbursed me money for a game that he can't find, so I go buy a used copy.
11099160	11109160	I go in, they have their special, two games for $10. I happen to notice at least a good quarter of the games on it are games I need for my PS3.
11109160	11118160	So, I've come to the conclusion that as long as it's not a new game, games I will see a little portion of my money.
11118160	11126160	So, what made you decide that ethically you're going to decide, okay, I'll boycott GameStop most of the time?
11126160	11136160	I figure, you know, I might as well get a good deal on a used game as long as I have the game, the manual, and the original box art.
11136160	11139160	If not, I'll go to Amazon and spend an extra $10.
11139160	11148160	I mean, eventually you just can't boycott fully forever. Eventually you get to that point where you know what?
11148160	11154160	Eff it. Might as well. I'm just going to go in, get what I want, and leave.
11154160	11161160	As long as they don't ask me for power up rewards, as long as they don't ask me to reserve this or that, I just want the game and I want to go.
11161160	11166160	That's part of the reason I like Amazon, because like Jamie, I don't like people sometimes.
11166160	11175160	And Amazon, you just click your thing, or any online site really, I know I keep hitting that one, but you just go on, you order what you want, and then it magically shows up at your door. It's great.
11175160	11184160	Yeah, at least you don't have to deal with this. You go into the store to buy something, headphones are on, and they're talking to you like you can hear them.
11184160	11185160	Right.
11185160	11195160	You can kind of hear them, but you know the transaction, what you're doing, so you just want them to just pull up the screen, you can punch in your rewards card, pay for your item, and leave.
11195160	11200160	Alright, well Ram, I'm going to let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thank you as always for the call.
11200160	11201160	Ain't no problem broski.
11201160	11203160	And everybody listen to Anime Jam Session.
11203160	11211160	Yes, because we will be covering what may be our very last con that we're going to, but we have another con review coming up in a couple weeks after that.
11211160	11213160	Well then it's not really your last con, is it?
11213160	11215160	For the staff, yes.
11215160	11217160	Wait, so you guys are quitting cons?
11217160	11219160	No, we're done for the year.
11219160	11221160	Oh, for the year. Oh god, I was like, oh my god, wait a minute.
11221160	11224160	Oh, no, no, no, never. Never.
11224160	11229160	I was like, Ram, what the fuck is going on? Okay, for the year, that makes sense.
11229160	11234160	No, I think my funeral services might be at a con. That's how much of a con for I am.
11234160	11246160	Rama, not that I want to talk about that day anytime soon, but if I happen to still be here when that happens, I will see to it that the fucking kids pay their respects to the great black Luigi.
11246160	11250160	Will we be putting up the death note with your name in it?
11250160	11253160	This time I will allow it.
11253160	11255160	Alright, take care buddy.
11255160	11266160	For the record, one last thing. Every time I see someone refer to SNK, I don't think of the anime, I think of my... and all the King of Fighters games.
11266160	11268160	I always think of Capcom vs SNK 2, which is me.
11268160	11273160	I keep thinking of Shingeki no Kyojin. You start reading the manga, it's phenomenal.
11273160	11275160	Yeah, I don't think I'm gonna.
11275160	11277160	You have to, it's so good.
11277160	11278160	I gotta wrap up, take care buddy.
11278160	11279160	Later.
11280160	11286160	That's gonna do it for the Skypline tonight. I'm really sorry to those that didn't get through, but if you want to call in in a future week, you can do that.
11286160	11296160	Call in, or you can always leave an email at mailbagatorangelaungeradio.com, a Facebook comment at facebook.com slash orangelaungeradio, or a tweet at twitter.com slash o-l-r.
11296160	11299160	Speaking of tweets, I have a few of these to do tonight.
11299160	11302160	sj100matt sent us a few tweets.
11302160	11306160	This one you sent us about Neon FM was in last week's show, just a heads up.
11306160	11311160	But the other one is about the Conan O'Brien thing where he played the scary games.
11311160	11314160	I've seen the tweets about this, I haven't watched this yet.
11314160	11318160	But I'll have to check this out, I don't want to play it over the air because it's Conan's thing.
11318160	11323160	But check that out, I'm sure it's hilarious because Conan is hilarious.
11323160	11328160	I paid a lot of money to see him live after he got kicked off of NBC and it was worth every penny.
11328160	11329160	So good times.
11329160	11333160	So check that out, he plays Slender the Eight pages and Amnesia and I'm sure it's great.
11334160	11336160	Tigerclaw sent us a few tweets.
11336160	11341160	Classic games are now preserved and accessible on archive.org.
11341160	11346160	How does this work? Because isn't emulation kind of a gray area? I'm trying to read about this.
11346160	11350160	The Internet Archive has created the Historical Software Archive,
11350160	11355160	which is significantly older software runnable in a browser, which includes many games.
11355160	11360160	Thanks to JSMess, the multi-emulator supersystem available in Java.
11361160	11365160	Jason Scott from the Internet Archive's site says,
11365160	11369160	We have the ability to watch video, listen to music, and read documents right in our browsers.
11369160	11372160	Not so with classic software until now.
11372160	11377160	Included in the collection are games such as Mystery House by Roberta Williams,
11377160	11380160	Karateka by Jordan Mechner, I remember that game,
11380160	11384160	and Atari's infamous E.T., the extraterrestrial.
11384160	11389160	I had no idea, like does the copyright lift on this after so many years?
11389160	11391160	I thought it was like 75 years and then some.
11391160	11394160	Because the Disney laws keep getting passed to keep Mickey Mouse out of public domain.
11394160	11397160	He might not have renewed that one.
11397160	11399160	I guess that's true.
11399160	11404160	Or maybe because emulation is such a gray area because these games are so old,
11404160	11407160	like maybe it's just not a big deal. I don't know.
11407160	11410160	But that's still pretty cool. I'll check that out after the show.
11410160	11415160	One other quick tweet here from Tigerclaw. It's about the Mortal Kombat film director,
11416160	11420160	Kevin Tancho Rowan. I'm totally mispronouncing that name, sorry.
11420160	11424160	He's the director of Mortal Kombat Legacy and he has walked away from it.
11424160	11426160	He talked about it on Twitter.
11426160	11431160	He did the Mortal Kombat Legacy web series and that was after Mortal Kombat Rebirth.
11431160	11436160	New Line Cinema actually asked him to direct a future film in the Mortal Kombat universe,
11436160	11438160	but he said,
11438160	11442160	After three years of combat, I've decided to move on to other creative opportunities.
11442160	11446160	I wish everyone involved in the movie a big success. Thanks.
11446160	11449160	I can see that. Three years is a long time to spend on one project.
11449160	11452160	You might not want your life and your career defined by the one thing.
11452160	11454160	So, I can see that.
11454160	11458160	Speaking of video games becoming movies, you know, BlizzCon is in two weeks
11458160	11461160	and there's going to be lots of Warcraft movie news that comes out of that, I'm sure.
11461160	11464160	I think they cast their first person too. I think I remember seeing a story on that too,
11464160	11467160	that their first official person is cast in that.
11467160	11471160	Oh, I know Tigerclaw tweeted that at some point,
11471160	11475160	but I don't have it up on the screen right now and it is live radio.
11477160	11480160	I think it's probably on the Horde House page.
11480160	11484160	I'm sure it got posted there. I'm trying to find it right now.
11484160	11486160	Nah, I can't bring it up. I don't remember the guy's name.
11486160	11492160	Maybe somebody will yell it out in chat, but it was from some Viking thing on TV.
11492160	11495160	I didn't recognize the name of the guy.
11495160	11497160	There was stuff about Colin Farrell in the past.
11497160	11499160	Yeah, those are rumors.
11499160	11506160	Him and Paula Patton, who is Robin Thicke's wife, is rumored for that movie too.
11506160	11509160	We don't know who they're playing though. They haven't said anything about that.
11509160	11513160	Alright, we'll get into more of that on Horde House.
11513160	11516160	But for now, this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio...
11516160	11517160	Travis Fimmel.
11517160	11518160	Thank you, thank you.
11518160	11521160	This week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio is about to an end.
11521160	11524160	Hey, I want to thank you guys for tuning in and listening to the show.
11524160	11528160	Thank you for supporting our little podcast that we do here every week.
11528160	11530160	We do this for you guys. You're great.
11530160	11534160	And if you like what you hear here at Orange Lounge Radio, please just help us spread the word.
11534160	11537160	Leave us a nice review on iTunes or a thumbs up on Stitcher.
11537160	11539160	Actually, Stitcher does reviews now. I don't know if you guys know that.
11539160	11543160	Stitcher has reviews, so you can review us there. That would be fantastic.
11543160	11548160	Or wherever you found out about this podcast, somebody else will probably find out about this podcast too.
11548160	11550160	So please help us spread the word.
11550160	11553160	In the meantime, we're going to go around and get everybody's final thought.
11553160	11556160	Jason, thank you very much for taking the drive up here to be with us tonight.
11556160	11557160	Always.
11557160	11558160	A little voiceover work you do on the show.
11558160	11559160	Always.
11559160	11561160	And thank you for being you.
11561160	11563160	Thank you for the washer and dryer.
11563160	11569160	It's the least I can do for the guy that helped keep our website up and running for the past so many years.
11569160	11570160	Decade?
11570160	11571160	Yeah, for the past decade.
11571160	11573160	It feels like a little bit under that. I think, what, 2004?
11573160	11576160	I think I was graduated by the time everything really happened. Maybe not.
11576160	11581160	Between you and Dekeman. Although it probably is about time we look at doing a new OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
11581160	11585160	Because there's so much. Now that we have VOG Network, there's so much on the old site we don't really use.
11585160	11590160	So we need to trim it back a little bit and get those Chinese spammers out of there. Bastards.
11590160	11592160	Anyway, your final thought, sir.
11592160	11595160	Wow, what is my final thought?
11595160	11604160	Hurry to driving. Another 14 hours next Saturday, plus the two hours tonight to get back to San Francisco.
11604160	11606160	It's nice. It's a wonderful drive.
11606160	11608160	Are you driving to Phoenix next Saturday?
11608160	11610160	Yeah, I'm out of here. I'm driving to Phoenix.
11610160	11613160	I almost was going to be doing that same drive.
11613160	11615160	Yeah, you mentioned it earlier. I was like, ooh, hello.
11615160	11619160	Yeah, I'm going to Arizona for at least a week next Saturday.
11619160	11623160	And the funny thing is I might even be back in San Francisco the following week.
11623160	11626160	And then I have to figure out what my Thanksgiving plans are going to be.
11626160	11632160	But if I do come back to San Francisco, that means I'm going to do the 22 hour drive I-80 back home.
11632160	11634160	Because that's the only one that makes sense.
11634160	11636160	Well, maybe we'll see you right back here on OLR next month.
11636160	11637160	Quite possibly.
11637160	11640160	You're always welcome at the house anytime, Jason.
11640160	11644160	All right. Let's see. How about Dark Sakura? Your final thought.
11644160	11645160	Animal Crossing.
11645160	11646160	Man, there's... no.
11646160	11647160	Ed, move out.
11647160	11648160	Fuck Ed.
11648160	11649160	That's the final thought.
11649160	11656160	I'm absolutely irritated and I'm just having now all three characters in my village ignore Ed.
11656160	11658160	Because fuck him.
11658160	11661160	Not really, because he's disgusting.
11661160	11664160	I'm sorry, you don't wear purple eyeshadow when you're blue.
11664160	11666160	It just doesn't work.
11666160	11667160	And you don't give people jackhammers.
11667160	11669160	I'll tell all the Smurfs I know your fashion tips.
11669160	11671160	You know what? Okay.
11671160	11676160	No, mine is... this has been the night for nostalgia.
11676160	11679160	Because, you know, Pokemon and rival schools.
11679160	11681160	But then, Ikuma.
11681160	11685160	You are wonderful, Ikuma-san, but you had to mention Last Blade.
11685160	11688160	And I love that series.
11688160	11691160	So, I want a new Last Blade game, too.
11691160	11694160	My final thought tonight is fuck this headache.
11694160	11699160	And bless that bottle of wine that I'm going to get to open because Alan was able to get home.
11699160	11701160	Because you want a bigger headache.
11701160	11702160	That's right.
11702160	11705160	Thank you, Alan, for running and making light rail.
11705160	11707160	He can't hear me. He has headphones on.
11707160	11708160	Alright.
11708160	11710160	Oh no, here he is.
11710160	11712160	He came out and said you're welcome. Thank you, Alan.
11712160	11714160	Rob, we bread.
11714160	11716160	Finally. Yay, Jamie, we mated.
11716160	11718160	Wait. Scratch that.
11718160	11719160	Loki, last but not least.
11719160	11721160	No, we breed puzzle pieces, remember?
11721160	11723160	Loki, last but not least. Your final thought.
11723160	11729160	My final thought is I'm still acquiring pieces for my portable screen thing.
11729160	11733160	I've actually been using that screen quite a bit at work because that's what we play.
11733160	11738160	It's what I play on my PlayStation 3, so it's working out really good.
11738160	11745160	And I'm now trying to find an audio amp, which I'm going to go with an old USB speaker.
11745160	11748160	And the battery, which I have one picked out already.
11748160	11752160	And now a DC-DC converter.
11753160	11758160	And then I just need to design a case and vacuum form that bitch.
11758160	11759160	Which will be hard.
11759160	11760160	Good luck.
11760160	11762160	The Virtual Boy looks so weird.
11762160	11764160	I love my Virtual Boy hat. I love it.
11764160	11766160	Alright, that's really it. We're done. We're out of here.
