15640	17101	All this and more begins right now.
31377	36559	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
36659	43941	It is Orange Lounge Radio episode number 525, October the 27th, 2013.
44081	51303	My name is Rob Roberts here with all you guys to talk about video games and gaming culture and so on and so forth with my co-hosts.
51743	54764	First up, the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
54944	55744	Can't tell it pruning.
57125	58265	You can't be gardening.
58645	60946	You're in the kitchen slash studio right now.
61426	62347	Oh, Animal Crossing.
62367	63167	She's just like a witch.
63447	65509	Wow, you actually have a little witch's hat for your character.
65549	67250	Because I paid money for Gracie items.
67310	67810	Adorable.
67830	68811	I have the full store now.
69071	69371	Wow.
69791	72313	You are like really hardcore into this Animal Crossing stuff.
72353	73313	It's no joke.
73614	76976	I have two characters that are mine and I made one for Julian because I'm bribing him.
77776	79257	But I'll talk about that during my gaming week.
79457	80477	I'm at the gym, let's play Pokemon game
101798	117616	I will say the new one is like way there's just more excitement and it's just a better coat of paint or just something it really energizes that whole brand in a way I haven't felt in a very long time well Hanukkah is coming up so whatever ask Hanukkah Harry for one no alright
118446	119126	I like how you think.
138731	146339	And then telling me that the eight people, however many people before me, you know, I'm just, I don't want to go much too into the interview.
146379	147120	Sure, sure, sure.
147200	149903	Cross your fingers, cross your toes, light some candles, say a prayer, whatever.
150063	152826	I'm trying not to be excited, but I need a prayer circle, Rob.
153160	154582	All right, let's join hands.
155342	159206	Okay, joining us in our prayer circle this evening, say hello to Tech Master Loki.
159787	159987	Hi.
160147	160788	How you doing, Loki?
161649	162109	Doing all right.
162229	162510	Yeah?
163331	170758	I wanted to get better food for dinner other than McDonald's, but I was too busy looking for UFO parts in Grand Theft Auto.
170778	170858	Oh.
171599	174001	I was like, wait a minute, is that like a toy for Josh?
174401	175422	Oh, it's a Grand Theft Auto thing.
176683	180787	I will tell you this, Loki, I came so close to finally jumping on that Grand Theft Auto 5 bandwagon this week.
180827	188653	We were at Fry's or Best Buy or one of those stores, and I almost did it, but then I was like, wait, Rob, you have an unopened copy of Grand Theft Auto 4 sitting on your shelf.
189093	189954	This is not okay.
190034	193277	You can't get on the 5 bandwagon until you at least play some 4.
194337	213526	you can get on the five bandwagon just fine and then Alan is like although I mean it will look that much better but you know I still think you can get on the bandwagon without playing it for but Alan is like Alan is like why don't you just wait in like a year there'll be the steam sale it'll be six bucks on PC what do you I mean granted we don't really have a PC version confirmed but
214457	216480	We all know it'll probably happen at some point.
216560	219344	So, you know, he's encouraging me to wait.
219364	221126	But I'm like, everybody's playing it now.
221847	224050	They're having the VOG nights now.
224951	225512	It's fun.
225792	226533	You're missing out.
226753	230258	But I need to save my money for the PlayStation 4 and all the games that aren't coming out.
231219	232120	Happy Birthday to Actdeft
252577	257319	It's not his birthday, but we always are happy to have him here in studio joining us with the show.
257579	258340	Say hello, everybody.
258400	259200	It's his unbirthday.
259240	263222	So a merry unbirthday to VXJasonXV, or just Jason.
263382	264923	The other Mexican across the table, no less.
265003	265763	That's right.
266204	266924	How you doing?
266984	268265	Just not living in Mexico.
268325	268765	Quienes.
280148	284349	Jason is the new VO guy for basically VOG Network.
284589	291711	I mean, Bobby does some of the VOs, but you're slowly kind of taking over because since you don't have a show right now, you did have one for a while, right?
291831	295992	Not on a network, not affiliated, but I was doing a podcast with some friends for a while.
296232	297752	That was before VOG and all that, right?
297972	299714	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
320456	331099	I have my microphone set up sitting nice and ready I love my studio studio slash office set up and I thought hey Rob can always use an extra hour on Sunday so this is probably a good idea
331556	358396	I like to think if the worst ever happened and OLR and Horde House were like both suddenly done which I don't even like to think about that but you know all things come to an end eventually nothing's on the radar yet folks I don't want to scare anybody but I like to think if these projects were to ever come to an end that's kind of like what I would want to do is it's like oh but that's like I've been doing this radio amateur stuff so long like I would have to do something for someone somewhere you know
359176	368221	But I like to think I could just start up another show somewhere, but maybe, I don't know, maybe in 10 years I would not really want to do that anymore and I'd just do VOs for somebody else.
368281	372283	And you have a ton of expertise that you can provide to someone else for the actual aspects of running a show.
372344	373424	Oh, inflate my ego more.
373444	376986	Producer, you know, producer, engineering, set up for streaming, recording.
377206	378327	Keep talking, you're my friend.
378967	382189	There's many, many ways to put together a show, live podcast or otherwise.
383090	386492	Everybody could be better and somebody with expertise could provide that.
386512	387092	Yeah.
387652	394976	Well, I couldn't do this every week and I don't think DarkSakura or Loki or even Jason could do this every week either if it weren't for the chatters.
395116	400378	And so hello to our chatroom, live.vognetwork.com and hello to the podcast listeners as well.
400438	402179	I don't want you guys to feel neglected.
402199	405120	We love everybody who participates with our show in one way or another.
405180	408302	But we do have the live chatters over at live.vognetwork.com.
408342	412204	Tiger Claw says, I wish Rob did the intro with the auto-tune.
413144	414046	I will say this.
414186	422018	We once were looking at doing a segment on the show that was Extifer sings the virtual console release dates.
422218	425223	Back when the Wii was newer and there was a virtual console every week.
425263	428507	Well, that was right when that app came out on iPhone that was like IMT Paint or whatever.
428528	428648	Mm-hmm.
428848	429808	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
453533	453914	Wow.
454034	457557	Which, spoiler alert, sucks ass.
457598	461822	But you can if you sort of try to sing, I guess, over it.
462242	464084	It sort of sounds auto-tuned.
465606	466287	I don't know.
466667	467248	You know what?
468529	469811	We both have Audition.
470792	471012	Mm-hmm.
471832	474894	All I need to do is sit down for an hour and I can probably figure out how to do it.
475034	475594	Well, yeah, no, no.
475634	478395	Now it's... I mean, keep in mind, this was five years ago.
478515	480616	We have new toys now that we didn't have five years ago.
481197	484158	But we also don't have Extifer as my roommate anymore.
484258	486519	So that idea is kind of long gone.
486539	487540	We have the internet.
487960	488260	We do.
488560	488820	We do.
489481	490641	But there's no virtual console.
490661	498085	Well, I guess Wii U virtual console games, but it's not... I remember when the Wii was first out, we were seeing virtual console games all the time.
498125	499045	It was like three a week.
499165	499646	And on Wii U...
500936	502117	They've been trickling through.
502177	504778	I feel like every week we're getting something, but let's be real.
504918	507779	It hasn't been a very strong lineup the past week or so.
508059	511581	Like, I think one week we got tennis and baseball.
512501	517144	And those were like the Nintendo versions, like very basic versions of those games.
517164	517764	The launch titles.
517784	518764	Yeah, part of the launch lineup.
518784	520425	I mean, they're basically named for crying out loud.
520445	521586	That tells you when they came out.
521726	522446	Yeah, exactly.
522466	526128	We could do the regular PlayStation Plus member awards thing.
526488	527709	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
551438	557325	DarkSakura, if you would dive into the email bag and pull out the email that I licked.
558386	559368	The email that you licked?
559568	559848	Yes.
560289	561991	It has the saliva all over it.
562071	565895	While I multitask opening my village for everybody who wanted me to do it.
566676	567437	Animals can wait.
567818	568438	Yeah, they can.
568498	569540	I'm just being nice to people.
570180	572042	Hey, OLR crew, AZHP here.
572422	575505	I wanted to get something off my chest that's been bugging me for a few weeks now.
575905	582010	I had some friends over to play scary games a few weeks ago, and a lot of them were giving advice on how to play Amnesia.
582651	586474	Then I asked them if any wanted to play since they had played it before, and they said, Oh, I haven't played it before.
586514	587735	I watched a playthrough on YouTube.
588236	594861	This got me kind of bummed out because I feel some of the magic of experiencing the game together with friends was gone because they knew what was going to happen.
596082	607678	When I discovered that watching scary game playthroughs is actually way more common than I thought, some of the most popular videos of the game Outlast have millions of views.
608239	613466	Outlast is an indie game and certainly hasn't sold millions of copies, so prospects for a sequel are slim at this time.
613846	617587	So my question to you guys is, do you think streaming is hurting certain genres of games?
618187	623029	This is a slightly different discussion than Nintendo streaming kerfluffle that happened a few months ago.
623369	630011	Because Nintendo games are often games with excellent gameplay mechanics that makes you want to play, want to have your own experience with the game.
630532	633092	Even after, I'm about to get logged out, sorry.
635113	637775	Even after watching someone play it.
638756	641518	But is that necessarily the same for horror games?
641598	645080	After seeing the twists and scares, does that make you want to go out and play the game?
645300	651604	And to play Devil's Advocate, were these people just never going to play these games because they were too scared to play it by themselves?
652085	664153	I feel like with the easy answer being, let's watch a playthrough on YouTube, these people who watch the stream could have mustered up enough courage to get a friend or two over and play the game as they are huddled up with blankets over their heads, gripping each other in fear.
665053	667275	Is this something we may lose forever due to streaming?
668016	670319	I've rambled enough, but I'd love to hear your thoughts on the issue.
670399	671159	Keep up the great work.
671360	672461	Love always, AZHP.
672932	680297	This is a really good question, and that's why I wanted to pull it at the top of the show as a kickoff topic, because it's also timely with Halloween being this next week.
680337	688142	A lot of people are thinking about scary games, and I'm sure some of you, I don't know if you guys do this, or maybe people listening, but... We have to watch Showgirls.
689323	693066	Everybody has their tradition, and mine is watching Showgirls every Halloween, because it's a scary movie.
693486	698890	But I'm sure some of you bring people over, and y'all play Silent Hill, or y'all play Amnesia.
698910	700371	We've done that at your old place with Exifer.
700391	700531	Yeah.
700771	701331	Yeah, certainly.
701631	702932	But this is a really good question.
703132	719878	I mean, just in general, and it doesn't even necessarily have to be about streaming or about scary games, but is this new technology in this world that we live in as gamers where Twitch TV is getting more and more popular and all its knockoffs, is this hurting gaming more than we want to admit?
720538	722319	No, no one really watches it for the twists.
722339	724660	They watch it for the people reacting to playing the games.
724680	725300	It's really what it is.
726241	726741	Not me.
727302	741633	I don't really... I'm with you, because of course my mind is going to go to, if you listen to Horde House, you know our buddy Gemet over there is infamous for doing these playthroughs where he screams at the top of his lungs while playing Slenderman, and people love it.
741653	742213	They heat it up.
742714	744075	That's why it's so popular.
744495	751220	It's not really about the game itself, which, I mean, the game's good, but it's watching these over-the-top reactions, which is why people do it, right?
751240	751340	Right.
751761	757466	Yeah, I mean, I saw some footage of Amnesia before, I just don't remember it.
759687	774459	Well, I remember, and even though I've beaten the game a bajillion times, I watch playthroughs of Silent Hill 3, because that's my favorite game, and sometimes I don't feel like putting it in and playing through everything, I just want to watch all the cinematics.
775480	775720	You know?
776781	790972	for me it's more or less that I go back and re-watch scenes of games that I've already played like especially scenes that I really like the only game I think as far as scary games that I've done that with are pretty much games I don't intend to ever play
792093	795295	I want to see exactly how bad this is type of game.
795875	803119	I'm not as much into Resident Evil anymore, so I'll watch a playthrough of one of the Resident Evil games just to keep up on the story.
803719	805460	But I don't really want to play it.
805660	806980	For me, I don't care.
807521	812623	If someone was like, oh yeah, let's come over and have a bunch of people while we play through this and make fun of it.
813023	814204	That's where you get the fun.
815245	820027	Even if you've already seen it, as long as you're not spoiling it for people like your friends were spoiling it for you.
821067	823188	Then that's the difference.
823749	825530	People just need to have a little bit of respect.
825710	828911	If they know you haven't played through it before, they need to keep their big mouth shut.
829351	839717	I think the emailer brings up a good point, though, is that there are probably people out there where they're not sure if they want to buy a scary $10, $15 video game that's out there right now.
839917	842158	Let's say Outlast, I think was the example used in the email.
842418	843099	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
858754	883381	I kind of think it's a it's a decent argument now I sort of think though it's twofold I kind of think for every person you convince not to buy the game I think there's people you also convince to buy the game that may not have done so before so I think there is a little bit of both there's the bad news and there's good news that we might be neglecting here a little bit Jason you have any thoughts on this and I invite our chat room to respond to at live.vognetwork.com
883681	898992	I was basically going to say that I agree with what Loki said and that there's going to be a lot of people that are going to use this as an excuse to see a game without playing it, whether it's for saving money, whether it's for something that they just didn't get a chance to play.
899712	913664	but there's nothing wrong with that for the same exact point that you made in that somebody else can get turned on to this a game they didn't hear of a game they were on the fence for they see a tiny little bit of it it interests them they want to see the rest of the story around it and so forth
915198	941677	you know there's a lot of games that come out right now and nobody plays every single one of them so having something that kind of fills the void of being able to see what a game was get a story in a universe that you're interested in it's not a bad thing everybody does not play all of the same games question for you guys at the table have any of you been convinced to buy a video game because of a live stream I want to say I did I can't remember what it is
943033	949338	Yeah, well not because of a stream, but it showed a lot of the gameplay in a YouTube video.
949878	951640	That's how I bought Drunken Robot Pornography.
952401	958486	I mean, yeah, it was more of a review, but he played through like a good bit of what had been out, and I was like, heck yeah, I want this.
959407	961348	Just listening to the music made me want that game.
961869	967313	I've also picked up indie titles based on, you know, happened to going through Twitch and seeing people play, so.
968074	969035	Surgeon Simulator.
971267	974970	2013.
972308	974970	That video, I had to buy it after watching that.
976071	993047	I can't think of one off the top of my head that I bought, but I will say that seeing streams convinced me to give Dota 2 a try and League of Legends, and I was kind of ignoring those, but because of all the streaming that goes on with that, I was kind of convinced like, oh, maybe I can try this too.
993925	995627	That's actually exactly the same point.
995827	1008219	The last time I was out here, I watched The International 3 with some coworkers, and once Dota 2 was finally available for Steam on Mac, I jumped on that and had a couple friends teach me how to play the game.
1009560	1018849	I don't want to say I'm good at it by any stretch of the imagination, but I'm to the point where I can actually learn on my own and sometimes hold up in multiplayer matches.
1019867	1027734	Going to our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com, SSJ100Matt says, I really just like watching my friends play games and occasionally do hilarious commentary.
1028435	1032719	AlanAlchemy with a comment that's teasing Gemet, which I'm always here for those.
1033279	1040005	AlanAlchemy says, and how Gemet takes his hands off the mouse and keyboard and slaps him over his face and stops playing the game when he hasn't even died yet.
1040305	1042087	It's hilarious and infuriating.
1043914	1045875	I'm going to get a nasty call on Skype this week.
1045995	1047375	God damn it, Rob Roberts.
1047696	1050697	I heard OLR this week, Rob Roberts, and you were talking shit about me again.
1050977	1055539	The other side of the coin from this email is party games because party games don't have something that you can spoil.
1055699	1059140	You see something live stream that's really fun and you pick it up immediately.
1059220	1059660	Good point.
1060181	1060421	Good point.
1060441	1063602	The first time I saw Mario U was on a live stream.
1064162	1067964	Because I didn't buy all that right when it first came out.
1068104	1070225	So I kind of saw it all like that morning.
1072365	1072826	Let's see.
1073046	1074746	Looking for more comments in our chat room.
1074926	1080608	DarkTetsuya at live.vognetwork.com says, To me it seems like the horror movie trailers or any trailer in general.
1080928	1084449	Sure, maybe you've seen some of the game, but there's still a good chunk that would surprise you.
1085489	1094311	BlackWolf, our good pal Bobby BlackWolf, who always does the show before us here at VOG Network, says, Well, I almost bought Final Fantasy XIV because of Sky's livestream.
1094691	1097412	And I'm interested in Hearthstone because of his livestream.
1098833	1100013	Interested and almost.
1100553	1110077	Actdeft actually said exactly the same thing that I wasn't even thinking about, is that you played Rogue Legacy, and I'll say this again once we hit our gaming weeks, but I've been playing a good chunk of that.
1110217	1112398	Every time I've seen that game, I've very much enjoyed it.
1112518	1113419	It's a good use of your time.
1113439	1114059	It's a great game.
1114799	1116500	Let me read another comment here, just a couple more.
1117141	1125924	Duran in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, I usually use demos or betas to decide if I want to play a game, but this is a nice way if those options aren't available.
1126185	1126905	It's a very good point.
1127485	1153819	and lastly I'll say from Dungeon Buster here I was on the fence with Amnesia a while back until I watched a few streams of it and picked it up so I mean a lot of positive like yes the streaming might be doing more good than bad not to dismiss the points of the original email though but I think there is a little bit of both I think there's some of what the emailer was saying and I think there's the other side of yeah but there's also another audience that may not have bought the game that is going to buy the game now
1154179	1154320	Yeah.
1165339	1168080	All right, anyhow, that'll do it for that topic.
1168140	1169241	Let's get into our gaming weeks.
1169841	1176925	For the record, I actually do totally want to have people in person for a good Silent Hill 3 playthrough.
1176945	1177725	It'll be fun.
1178066	1178546	Good times.
1179927	1181988	Actually, one comment I do need to respond to in chat.
1182008	1184709	Codeman says, Rob, have you played Outlast yet?
1185029	1185870	I have not.
1186250	1188051	Codeman was kind enough to gift me a copy.
1188731	1191873	I will say time is running out for me to do that, though, because Halloween is this week.
1192233	1193034	DarkSakura
1209484	1210564	You're not playing it right now.
1210684	1211265	No, not right now.
1213425	1214306	By the way, Normandy's open.
1215826	1221888	I played Final Fantasy XIV, and I got on a quest that was really pissing me off, so I just said screw it and got my second job.
1222268	1232071	So I'm at level 10 Thaumaturge, and when I hit 15, maybe tonight, I'll go back to spamming whatever I have to do as a sorcerer, maybe.
1232091	1233712	Not sorcerer, summoner, I guess.
1233852	1234492	I don't know how that works.
1235012	1238840	Anyway, so I'm playing that.
1240123	1243029	I got Gone Home, but I haven't started it yet.
1243169	1245795	Did I play some Super Mario 3D World Land?
1245975	1246135	Mm-hmm.
1246997	1247517	Whatever it is.
1247537	1249058	Oh yeah, that's right, because you borrowed that from me last year.
1249118	1249578	Yes, I did.
1249779	1250799	Whatever, 3D stuff.
1251940	1252580	Without the 3D.
1254741	1265887	I also played some Fractal, and I've played Mass Effect 3, I've played the first Mass Effect, because I bought Chadi the first two games on PC, and she hasn't been able to get hers to work.
1266147	1266688	I don't know why.
1267348	1271951	So I've been playing mine to walk her through getting all of her stuff set up.
1272911	1275953	And now that I'm in the game, I just can't resist rolling another Shepard.
1275973	1277434	I totally forgot where I was.
1277594	1287179	No, I have another Shepard that I'm playing as kind of the, let's see if we can get Garrus to go the specter path, which we know that doesn't really happen anyway, so whatever.
1287639	1288180	Spoilers!
1289160	1293963	But I'm playing that one, and I completely forgot where I was.
1294023	1295063	I haven't even done, like...
1296284	1299106	I think I just finished Novaria and that's it.
1300047	1305510	So I was playing those and I was playing something else.
1306090	1311393	Oh, Dan has broken out the GameCube and is playing the Mimish Cap.
1312574	1312914	Oh, nice.
1313535	1315596	He's like, we've had this game for how long?
1315956	1317597	And I've played it for not how long?
1318138	1318878	I'm going to play it.
1318938	1322560	So that's what all I've been hearing all morning is a mix of Animal Crossing music and the Mimish Cap.
1324121	1324421	Alrighty.
1324441	1324982	Yeah.
1325475	1326436	There it is, your gaming week.
1326916	1327176	Loki!
1328297	1331219	I only play Grand Theft Auto V. What a shock!
1331519	1332320	I know, shocking.
1333541	1339405	So, I've been still trying to go through single player and get 100%, so that's what I've been working on.
1340126	1347111	I finished the flight school stuff, even though I wanted to throw a controller when it came to some of the...
1347831	1349012	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1368288	1377752	I can go in and it actually updates as I get stuff so I know, okay, I have to go here, I have to do this, because no one really wants to just wander the map looking for that shit.
1377912	1382193	I just want it done immediately so I can get on to the next thing.
1383194	1390537	And then playing a little bit of online at work, mostly the PlayStation 3 version, so I'm level 17 in that now.
1391217	1393758	And another VOG Gaming Night, I think we're going to
1394258	1400321	Take turns on the Fridays, so we'll probably have one next Friday around 8 o'clock.
1400641	1402942	Haven't decided if it's going to be PS3 or 360 yet.
1403262	1406584	Probably 360, so stay tuned for that.
1406704	1408665	And then, of course, the following week we'll probably do PS3.
1411303	1411643	All right.
1412064	1414065	So lots and lots of Grand Theft Auto 5.
1414586	1420950	And once again, if you want to join the VOG Club on Grand Theft Auto 5, all the information is in our forums at vognetwork.com.
1420971	1422312	Just click on forums at the top of the screen.
1422332	1424813	Yeah, socialclub.rockstargames.com.
1425714	1430958	And I think it's just slash crew slash vognetwork.
1431318	1433760	And I think last I checked, we had 46 people.
1434021	1434221	Nice.
1436242	1437703	And we now have...
1439365	1439785	50!
1439505	1439785	We hit 50.
1440526	1441627	Climbing.
1442087	1442367	Awesome.
1443028	1447652	Alright, Jason, our guest here and voiceover guy, what have you been up to?
1447832	1449614	This map is really freaking amazing.
1449874	1458301	I remember when I learned that it was impossible to 100% Just Cause 2, that it would have been really nice to have something that just shows us where all the items are.
1458622	1464487	When you get to like a 90-90% completion rate where running all over the continent is just ridiculous...
1464955	1469499	Oh yeah, I still have a few orbs I have to get in Crackdown, the first one.
1469559	1471880	Yeah, same problem.
1472080	1475923	Crackdown is even smaller than Just Cause 2 is, but still, yeah.
1475943	1481668	Something like that that helps you to the most monotonous grinding possible would be incredibly beneficial.
1482948	1510758	as I said earlier I've been playing a ton of Rogue Legacy and ripping my hair out with that collectively as well as FTL Faster Than Light which has been frustrating because even on easy I can't make it all the way across the galaxy and I've been very disappointed of this constantly I mentioned on Twitter last night that I went out to a friend's house down in San Francisco and I played Artemis the Starship Bridge Simulator for the first time we played for something like
1511438	1512980	Four hours, you gave me a glance.
1513000	1514141	Have you not heard of this before?
1514502	1515863	No, I have not, but it sounds interesting.
1516043	1523852	Artemis, I don't know what's new, what's old, but basically what it amounts to is that you have a starship, up to six of them, as a matter of fact.
1525093	1530599	You run either a server, or I think it's one server per ship, and you can have up to...
1531700	1548352	8 or 9 positions that encompass a starship bridge comms, helm, weapons, engineering, science that actually does like shield scanning and what not sector scanning and then obviously the captain is required I think you basically have to have at least 2 players but the more you have the better it is
1549232	1553336	and you start the game with a given scenario.
1553696	1567547	You have deep space stations, in our case DS1-4 to protect wormholes, space whales, minefields that you can use to your advantage or stop paying attention and destroy yourself very quickly.
1568007	1569328	It's an incredible amount of fun.
1569668	1573373	By the way, this game's getting a big response in our chatroom here at live.vognetwork.com.
1573393	1574794	BlackWolf says, I love Artemis.
1575435	1577838	Tim trips in chat and says, Artemis is so fun.
1578399	1580761	And SSJ100Matt says, Artemis is at PAX East, right?
1581562	1582764	I think it was.
1582884	1583505	I don't remember.
1583665	1585607	I didn't go, but I think it was one of those games.
1585767	1588290	I've seen a ton of footage and, you know, the places they can...
1589131	1595994	Take the main screen, the bridge screen and make it gigantic and have all of the stations situated strategically.
1596414	1603458	There's an immense amount of potential to take that game, make the experience as fun as possible and as good as you want it to be.
1604258	1607660	I am looking at footage of this game on YouTube that Bobby sent me.
1607700	1608200	How about that?
1608220	1610201	A Let's Play I'm using to look at the game.
1610681	1612942	So, yeah, this looks like they're having fun.
1612962	1616143	They're all kind of sitting around the table on all their little laptops yelling at each other.
1616724	1617124	That's cool.
1618030	1618530	and DarkSakura.
1647170	1648370	That sounds like a lot of fun.
1648390	1649691	It is so fun.
1649751	1650811	I gotta be honest, though.
1651031	1662074	If they were to slap Star Trek onto this, I know I shouldn't say that because this is an indie game and let it grow and be its own thing, but I have to say, can you imagine if they could slap Star Trek onto this?
1662194	1664574	It would basically be a Star Trek LARP.
1665075	1666635	People would so be there.
1666655	1670516	They've tried doing console Star Trek games that just did not take off.
1672296	1673817	With the intent of being a simulator.
1673837	1674037	Sure.
1674957	1681362	well even Ragenator wants to know in our chat room does it help to say engage or make it so or speak like Shatner when playing Artemis?
1682642	1704317	the captain did not did not take the role of a particular character from any universe like that but I would use those words because I was doing Helm and so we would have the rotation of the ship and you can also have a warp or a jump ship jump being you instantly go to a certain place of course and warp that progressively
1704717	1705638	HighRateTraveling.
1706598	1714621	He'll give me coordinates, and I will say locked in or coordinates engaged or jump engaged, 10 seconds to jump, all that kind of stuff.
1715722	1720604	We had fun with it, and it kind of comes with the territory of us all being the geeks that we are.
1720744	1721124	Of course.
1721424	1724626	We didn't take specific characters, but we had a hell of a lot of fun with it.
1725346	1728587	Tim Tripp in our chatroom says, I basically pretend it's Star Trek anyways.
1728687	1729448	Okay, it's not just me.
1731248	1741212	Revision 3 has a short little video of this game and they are all dressed up in Star Trek appropriate attire, uniforms and everything, color appropriate and the whole thing.
1741912	1749295	And I will say that our weapons individual was the space cowboy and he was playing that character very, very well.
1750650	1759032	Sorry, I'm just cracking up at chat because Tim Drip follows up with saying, Practice is my best Janeway voice, which Extifer over at Horde House does this so much better than I do.
1759092	1763673	But, you know, that's all Tom Paris, Harry Kim, Harry Kim, Tom Paris, Tom Paris.
1764073	1766353	That's all he does is yell those two names over and over, but it's funny.
1766373	1767493	I've been watching through Voyager.
1767753	1768754	Yeah, it was a good show.
1768794	1769454	It was underrated.
1770634	1771274	So, anyhow.
1771414	1771674	All right.
1771874	1772414	You know what?
1772554	1772774	What?
1773615	1774075	No, it wasn't.
1777813	1807003	Voyager was full of bad decision after bad decision and Janeway going fuck it I'm Janeway we're in the middle of Delta space I don't have to follow shit and that's the tale of Voyager I'm not asking for directions I am the direction it's a real trip though to see Janeway on Orange is the New Black I'm just saying it's a different role for her okay anyhow oh shit that was her I didn't even realize it after watching no it didn't even click
1809213	1829206	and there's also McCoy on some cops SWAT something I saw a commercial for obviously Avonverse McCoy is on some new TV show and that's quite a jump I love you GameGuru because you know SF Debris if you ever want to see the funniest mockery of the Janeway voice ever go to SF Debris
1830180	1833626	I was going to say, you know, Voyager had some pretty epic guest stars.
1833666	1836390	Like, Sarah Silverman was a guest star on an episode of Voyager.
1836731	1840617	And, like, she wasn't being her typical, like, you know, over-the-top hilarity.
1840677	1841859	Like, she was playing it serious.
1841919	1843701	So it's so funny to see her on the show.
1844142	1844683	You know, like...
1845945	1847806	I'm going on the Voyager, huh?
1848087	1862281	I just can't help but think always though of Maria Bamford doing her I used to work at the Star Trek experience as a Bajoran her Bajoran refugee voice I can never get that out of my head whenever I think of Star Trek
1862881	1867646	Bobby Blackwolf says, I hear Orange is the new Black is better if you pretend it's just Janeway in the holodeck.
1867966	1869107	It could be your fantasy.
1869247	1869768	Alright, look.
1869788	1872670	This is getting way too far away from video games.
1872970	1873531	Way too far.
1873951	1876293	It's just the expanse of the Star Trek universe.
1876373	1878175	Look what this Artemis game does to people.
1878355	1879957	Alright, I'm kidding.
1880117	1885261	I think we've also just admitted that we know way too much about Voyager than we should say in public.
1886682	1889385	I know nothing about Voyager other than you know
1890953	1894877	I will, however, watch an entire season of Voyager before I watch any more Enterprise.
1894997	1895517	There you go.
1896178	1899762	You know, true story, the first time I ever got drunk was at the Star Trek experience.
1899962	1902985	First time in my life I ever got drunk was at Warped Core Breach.
1903165	1903946	I love those things.
1904046	1908731	Fucking Travis over at Under Sedation Live here at VOG Network has the voicemail thing.
1908931	1911134	Anyway, long story that I'm not going to recap.
1911554	1914895	By the way, I did find in Las Vegas a replacement for the Warp Core Breach.
1915135	1915535	Oh, what's that?
1915815	1918936	It's at this place at the Paris Casino.
1919417	1926339	Their little dessert bar, whatever place, has fuzzy drinks with foam coming up out of it like the Warp Core Breach.
1926879	1929280	And whatever their red one is tastes like a Warp Core Breach.
1929580	1929880	Nice.
1929960	1931320	I just don't remember what it was called.
1931360	1932601	It was red and I was drunk.
1933141	1933561	Nice.
1933821	1935162	I gotta go to Vegas one of these times.
1935562	1940104	A friend of mine is trying to talk me into going to New Media Expo, which I think is right around the time of CES.
1940304	1944126	So it's like, oh, if I could do a double and do both those cons, it'd be a lot of fun.
1944146	1948307	But anyway, let's talk about my gaming week and the type of stuff that I've been playing this week.
1948327	1952729	Which, you know, much like Loki, I still have been playing plenty of Final Fantasy XIV.
1953169	1959132	We perfected earlier today speedruns of Wanderer's Palace, which if you know the endgame, that's one of the instances that you can do in the endgame.
1959332	1960012	Hotline Miami
1977057	1977558	Thanks for watching!
1996175	1996636	DarkSakura, Luke,
2011172	2015413	Very fast-paced game, and in the retro sense, I find a lot of it is about memorization.
2015773	2027497	Like, okay, here, you're going to go onto this floor in this house that you're invading for whatever reason, and I'm going to go kill that guy, and I'm going to take his weapon, and then go kill that guy, and that guy, and then I've got to run over here and lure that guy out.
2028177	2033459	You start to think of the memorization like it's a Mega Man level or something, like in retro.
2033599	2038501	I know it's a lot of trial and error, but unfortunately for me, I tend to error a lot more
2039861	2040622	Then I do succeed.
2040662	2044884	But it's something about the soundtrack of that game kind of like gets you going.
2045144	2046225	Yeah, I want to play more of that.
2046245	2048486	So I was having a lot of fun with that on PlayStation 3.
2049027	2052329	So again, if you have PlayStation Plus, check it out.
2052449	2052869	It's free.
2053029	2054470	You really have no reason at this point.
2055330	2055750	Not two.
2056891	2076638	And even, I'm sure it'll be discounted on Steam, and I don't think it's a very expensive game to begin with on any of the platforms it's on, so it's worth the money if you like old retro puzzle memorization games, and if you like an abundance of violence with your retro games, because I will tell you, there's an abundance of violence in this game.
2078478	2105010	and Shooting Dogs Alan Alchemy in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com backing us up, it absolutely needs memorization to get through it alright, let's see other games that I've been playing this week I did play a game it's not a new game, but it's new to me it's called Midway Arcade Origins which is a retro game collection that's available, I think it's on 360 and PS3, don't know about Wii or Wii U, I don't think it's there, I think it's only on the others
2107012	2107733	Here's the thing.
2107793	2110916	The Midway game collection's kind of been done before.
2111376	2112518	And I actually rented this.
2112558	2113138	I didn't buy it.
2113519	2118944	Because I was a little hesitant to buy it because, well, I already have Midway Arcade Treasures on PlayStation 2.
2120046	2121647	Like, there's three different volumes of it, right?
2121667	2122548	I have all three volumes.
2122849	2125852	So most of the games in this I already have in one way or another.
2127033	2145946	and I think they even had on the PlayStation 1 some of these games were available and it's kind of funny because some of these games we've seen before this generation Joust was an early $5 Xbox Live Arcade game and that's in the collection now for you know what you can probably find this for $19.99 on Amazon at this point or Gaming Stories buy this new
2146426	2148087	DarkSakura.com
2176025	2176226	Maybe.
2176246	2176346	Maybe.
2177307	2177727	Maybe.
2196708	2198789	Just like Punch-Out isn't Mike Tyson anymore.
2198849	2199209	Exactly.
2199249	2203191	They gave him a mustache and just photoshopped his name out so now it's just super off-road or whatever.
2203672	2205973	But I had a lot of fun playing that game.
2206133	2211876	Although I will say it loses a little something when you don't have the steering wheel that you can just spin around uncontrollably.
2212256	2221644	Remember, like, they were totally fake steering wheels, and they had no stop on the left or the right side, so when you were a kid, you would just spin that thing like crazy when you're trying to turn around, and it was a lot of fun.
2221684	2231112	It doesn't translate the same way to the, you know, thumbsticks, but it's an awful lot of fun to kind of have that whole experience, because I don't remember an arcade-perfect version of that.
2231612	2235296	I know on the NES they had a version of that, but it was a little...
2237037	2237557	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2257671	2261372	DarkTetsuya and GameGuru both in our chatroom telling me that Midway Treasures 3 actually did have Super Off-Road in it.
2277837	2284164	I just don't remember that, and to be honest, I'm looking over at my collection, I actually have Midway Arcade Treasures 1 and 2, so I guess I never picked up 3.
2284704	2287187	3 had Hydro Thunder, and it was all racing games, right?
2287527	2289209	I wonder why I skipped that one.
2289389	2296617	I remember having to seek out 3 on the PS2 for a very specific purpose, and I don't think it was off-road, but I know there was some other game that I wanted in it.
2296983	2300224	So anyway, as far as retro classic game collections go, it's fine.
2300884	2303725	Especially if you don't have these games already in one way or the other.
2304065	2305346	It's kind of neat to have them again.
2305386	2308347	And yeah, they've got the leaderboard and the trophies.
2308467	2309407	That's that.
2309767	2311688	Otherwise, not a lot to scream about.
2312448	2317390	But if you're a retro gaming fan, it's really nice to see them in the crisp HD.
2317750	2319711	And you can put different filters on the graphics too.
2319751	2321671	You can have it super sharp or smooth.
2322332	2323432	So you can do those little things.
2324492	2346443	and you know especially now that the title is a budget title it's it would be worth your time if you like retro games anyhow that does it for my gaming week so let's quickly do some housekeeping don't forget you can add us on twitter twitter.com slash olr and we're also on facebook facebook.com slash orange lounge radio we appreciate all our friends on those sites we're also on google plus as we'll get to later in the show
2348184	2366660	and I do want to remind you guys I mentioned this last week and just want to remind you guys there will be no new show in two weeks we will have the night off so we'll be here next week on November 3rd if I'm thinking right with the dates but we will not be here on November 10th because I will be coming back from Los Angeles and my not BlizzCon trip
2367193	2368994	and I get to trash your house.
2369354	2371614	DarkSakura will be house sitting and kitty sitting.
2371995	2372935	I got paid in Duffy.
2373375	2375015	Yes, as she kindly offered to do.
2376276	2377156	I would have done it for free.
2377336	2377636	I know.
2377816	2378417	Thanks for the Duffy.
2378577	2378977	You're welcome.
2379377	2380817	I've been sitting on that for like three months.
2381578	2381638	Ow!
2383158	2384960	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2401918	2406863	So I said, fine, I'll go to BlizzCon, except there's no way I can get a ticket now.
2407664	2409946	BlizzCon is a fortress to get in as media.
2409966	2411327	You're either on their list or you're not.
2411728	2416492	So I'm just going to go to the parties and then go to Disneyland, which is BlizzCon enough, right?
2416512	2416593	Yeah.
2417253	2417713	Discon.
2434662	2436124	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2450922	2466189	I'm gonna be at an event called World of Podcasts which is Thursday night I'll be there I'm not featured because again I wasn't planning on going so I missed the boat on all that stuff but Grandpa from our show is on one of the panels over there so yeah I'll be at World of Podcasts so if you're gonna be there come say hi
2467009	2493596	and say hi to Grandpa as well and then I don't know whatever else I get invited to Friday or Saturday we'll go to that too although Alan and I are going to try to do a Carthay Circle dinner one of those nights so probably Saturday night because I think that's when the closing ceremonies are so there's usually not a lot going around because they usually have a big old concert although they didn't announce any like big there's no like Ozzy Osbourne or anything this year so I don't know what they're doing for the closing ceremonies it's got to be a secret so all right it's a secret to everybody it is a secret to everybody
2494349	2498672	Alright, let's move on with some gaming news.
2498993	2500594	And Loki, gonna start us off tonight.
2500953	2512397	All right, there's a rumor that's, I guess, going on saying that there's going to be a brand new... Sorry, you know it's a slow gaming week when we have to start off, or a slow news week in gaming when we have to start off with a rumor.
2512637	2516558	So I apologize in advance, but it's not the best week in news.
2516698	2518119	There's nothing to talk about.
2518579	2519519	We're stretching tonight.
2519539	2520520	Fully admitting.
2520980	2521580	Fully admitting.
2521640	2529583	Like, listen, I'm not covering that story about, you know, NASCAR being, you know, the rights for NASCAR going to Deep Silver because no one fucking cares.
2532665	2538389	I know there's Ragnar out there who still has his gaming console that he stole.
2538809	2545294	So there's this series that I guess they're calling Reimagined because that's dumb.
2546055	2552344	Um, it's supposed to be, I guess, seven Nintendo 64 games that are being redone in HD.
2553486	2560677	And, God, I hope they're really actually redoing everything if they're actually going to do this and not just up-resing them because it's going to look like shit.
2561158	2564261	It's also going to look weird too because they're not going to be all fuzzy and cloudy anymore.
2565542	2571107	They're also saying that all seven games would feature new content and retail at $30.
2572248	2579254	The idea is Nintendo would be filling the gaps in their Wii U lineup by re-releasing older Nintendo 64 games.
2580655	2607611	here's kind of funny part though about that is they are already filling well I should say their lineup is already including older games that are being remade like Wind Waker HD for example or you know even before the Wii U they had their new play control games which they literally did nothing to except for change the control on it you know oh hey now it uses a Wii remote instead of you know GameCube controller because that's so much better it's not
2610874	2614478	And yeah, one of the rumors, of course, is that Mario 64 is going to be the first game.
2614518	2616240	Of course, it's going to be Mario 64.
2616320	2618522	They're not going to do Superman 64.
2618822	2620864	Hey, let's leave with that.
2621445	2624588	Mario Kart 64 would cannibalize a little bit of Mario Kart 8.
2624708	2629413	I don't think... I mean, I could see them doing something like this, but I would think of anything...
2630674	2659035	I just don't know how much of a draw there's really going to be for people to get HD versions of these games I'm sure some people will be interested in but I don't know I would think they'd be better off just doing like I could see this maybe for the 3DS because remember they did this with Ocarina and Star Fox and that kind of stuff I could see that happening but
2661317	2661717	I don't know.
2661777	2662898	It just sounds like a rumor to me.
2663098	2663458	Whatever.
2665879	2673422	Well, I realize it's a big old rumor, and Nintendo remaking their games wouldn't exactly be out of character for them or whatever, right?
2673442	2674022	I know, yeah.
2674143	2682026	But it seems like it's not a very long process for them, and the games turn out pretty well received.
2682206	2683847	I'm thinking of the Zelda or Wind Waker HD 30s.
2684687	2691909	Yeah, but the problem with Wind Waker HD, though, is that it had way better graphics than, you know, the GameCube... Well, because it was a GameCube game.
2691950	2696711	It wasn't that different than, you know, a regular Wii game or something like that.
2696731	2699972	So it wasn't... They weren't doing a whole lot.
2700252	2708015	Whereas if you were doing Mario or like any of the Nintendo 64 stuff, you're going to have to do quite a bit to that to make it look nice.
2708395	2713477	Because just up-resing it and making the polys look nicer and stuff...
2713877	2723023	It's gonna look like, I mean, fuck, you can just pull it up on YouTube and look at any of the emulators out there that do any sort of upscaling on that stuff, and it just, it doesn't look that good.
2723303	2741314	Like, even when I ran stuff in, like, an emulator on, like, the Ouya and stuff, and that sort of did some uprising and stuff, it just doesn't look good on your TV, because, yeah, everything's smoother looking, but it's just so empty, because those games, you know, couldn't, they couldn't do very far draw distances, or, you know, they didn't have a lot of detail in there, because...
2742114	2743155	It couldn't handle it.
2743735	2745416	It's just, I don't know.
2746696	2749938	It's a neat idea, but I just don't know how well it's going to look.
2750918	2751679	We'll see, I guess.
2752359	2759943	SSJ100Matt with a comment in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com The recent Mario Kart games have had the older tracks remade into the new games.
2759983	2762804	That's another good reason why Mario Kart 64 would be a little redundant.
2762844	2771051	Yeah, you know, as much as I like playing the older tracks, I think that's such a cop-out of like, hey, look, we can double the content now without having to do anything.
2771071	2775134	I do think they could release a bunch of old tracks as DLC.
2775375	2776376	I think that would be really cool.
2777577	2778017	Why not?
2778217	2780939	Why not have the balls and put a fucking track editor in there?
2781880	2785043	Oh, you afraid that people are going to come up with better track designs than your own?
2785203	2788446	But Loki, somebody might draw a penis as a track.
2789167	2789527	Not me.
2789987	2791928	I've decided I know what track I would design.
2792029	2792409	Boobs.
2792829	2793749	No, even better.
2793909	2794110	What?
2794570	2796551	I would have the full-on vag track.
2796971	2798952	You know, with a little loop.
2798972	2801133	See, I knew you were dirtying it up somewhere.
2801633	2802114	Oh, come on.
2802994	2808437	I think it's totally unfair to automatically assume that people are going to put a penis in when it is much better to put a vag in.
2808477	2809337	My next guess was boobs.
2809377	2810098	I'll tell you why.
2810198	2812919	I'll tell you why it's easy for people to put a penis in there.
2812939	2815360	Because who is the demographic for these games?
2815621	2817842	Teenage boys and pre-pubescent boys.
2818582	2819482	What have they seen?
2819743	2820743	They've seen their penis.
2820943	2821803	What have they not seen?
2822024	2823384	They have not seen a vagina.
2823504	2825625	And this would be the only way they ever would.
2827826	2830147	I would be doing them a favor.
2830767	2831928	It's familiar territory.
2832068	2835189	You didn't see fucking Bob Ross painting buildings and cars.
2835369	2837811	You saw him painting trees because that's what he knew.
2837991	2838771	He knew trees.
2839151	2841492	Just like kids, they know penises.
2842252	2845474	If you want to be technical, it had to do with his painting style, but that's a different thing.
2846618	2848659	Goddammit, I want to see a fuzzy fucking building.
2849039	2851460	He can do it.
2851480	2852200	From the grave.
2852220	2853321	I approve of this.
2853341	2854701	It will officially be called the Vulva Vroom.
2862598	2863058	Coach Buzzcut.
2863079	2863299	Yeah.
2863319	2863399	Yeah.
2891179	2898545	Kick me in the jibby So is that like, you know, like Mario teaches typing, it's Birdo teaches sex ed or something like that?
2900967	2918042	Teaching, this is all the stuff that I didn't want and I had it changed So you could even have it on the Wii U You could be like, now touch where you're gonna find the G spot And then the person touches, no, this is why you'll never get laid
2919031	2928923	show me on the touchpad where they touched you you get the orgasm trophy they don't have trophies on Wii U, DarkSakura well I don't have a Wii U so I don't care and
2935225	2936666	Was there more with that, Loki?
2936706	2937066	I'm sorry.
2937286	2940228	I think I cut you off and suddenly we went into... No, we were done talking.
2940348	2942510	We were in playground chat at that point.
2942530	2943310	We were done talking.
2943350	2944471	It's a rumor.
2944551	2945392	Rumor, rumor, rumor.
2945412	2946372	Rumor, rumor, rumor.
2946492	2951335	There's another joke there about the name of the game and for some strange reason I just can't put the words together.
2951936	2953377	Something, something, and we use...
2954757	2955698	What was the name of this?
2955958	2956998	Re-U-Magined?
2957078	2958079	Re-U-Magined, yes.
2958099	2958819	Re-U-Magined.
2959279	2962600	It honestly sounds like a special episode of RuPaul's Drag Race.
2963221	2964781	Like Ru-U-Magined or something.
2964821	2967563	Is that what the Lost episodes, what they're calling that on TV right now?
2968183	2969583	You know I've never watched an episode of that.
2970504	2971204	The Ru-vibed episode.
2971224	2972485	How are we friends?
2973245	2974085	I mean to.
2974466	2975406	I used to watch Drag U.
2976195	2977215	Oh, okay, well, similar.
2977636	2978236	Then you know enough.
2978436	2983238	Because I like seeing, as much as Rue makes a gorgeous woman, I loved the suits.
2984018	2984939	It was all about the suits.
2985339	2986079	That red suit.
2986619	2996203	Tim Tripp in our chat says, I just had a moment where I thought I was listening to Horde House, but we didn't have Grandpa say something racially insensitive, so it's not truly an episode of Horde House at this point.
2996323	2998524	Let's move on quickly before we go there.
2998544	3001625	Maybe I'm just channeling exta for an entirely feminine manner.
3003226	3005128	I haven't brought up bleaching the parts.
3005788	3009531	Next story is about Nintendo as well.
3009911	3012053	Talking about cross-play titles.
3012533	3017877	Right now, most cross-play we think of on PlayStation with PS3 or 4 and the PlayStation Vita.
3018157	3020819	In fact, Hotline Miami, I was talking about earlier in the show.
3021079	3024482	When you download that, you get a Vita version and a PlayStation 3 version.
3025342	3027684	All your saves transfer through the cloud.
3027724	3028705	It's all through the cloud.
3029105	3029726	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3050164	3057607	Virtual Console on the Wii U because it has two screens and the same damn controls and you can fucking do any 3DS game on there.
3058147	3059267	They're just not doing it yet.
3059948	3063569	Alright, well Nintendo has come out and said, quote, I almost said Vita.
3071952	3075095	as well as other video game systems not made by Nintendo.
3075696	3085206	And the reasoning behind that, just so you know, this is because of pure chess, which you can actually play on the Wii U, but you can also cross-play with PlayStation 3 and Vita.
3085606	3093314	Now, the reason why this is news is because this is a huge reason why you do not see Final Fantasy XIV on the Xbox 360.
3094355	3101483	Square wanted to put it on the 360, but Microsoft said, no, we will not support the cross-play element.
3101783	3105547	You will not be able to... Xbox has to be its own server, its own world and everything.
3105667	3113175	Xbox will not cross-play, which is funny because Final Fantasy XI was totally not like that and had play-online...
3114016	3129388	but you have to go back a few years Microsoft was desperate to have a Final Fantasy game on the 360 so they broke their own rule in that case only and that's why you got 13 later on on the 360 which was controversial but I digress back to Nintendo
3130169	3130709	Smash Brothers.
3130729	3131310	Well, not cross systems.
3154941	3158444	I didn't think that the Wii U had an online portion for Disney Infinity.
3159444	3162887	Because I know they were... I think it maybe was limited to two players only.
3164348	3169571	But I thought that that was something that was taken out of... I can't speak firsthand because I haven't played Disney Infinity.
3169591	3170632	Maybe I'm thinking the Wii version.
3170672	3171573	I'm not aware of that.
3171613	3176096	I think you're thinking of either the regular Wii version, but I think the Wii U is comparable to the other systems.
3176716	3179138	So I don't think that's... Maybe somebody in chat knows.
3179158	3181039	Well, it's nice that different consoles play together.
3181059	3181340	I mean...
3182060	3182460	TV, TV, TV, TV
3199726	3201428	What can you do by moving your hand?
3201488	3202809	You can... Anyone?
3202869	3203090	Anyone?
3203150	3203390	Anyone?
3203430	3204631	You can Skype?
3204651	3205452	Flip off the characters?
3206012	3206373	That's it.
3206493	3206813	Skype.
3207354	3209836	But isn't Skype cross-platform by default?
3210436	3211858	I can Skype on my iPhone.
3212238	3213780	I can Skype on my computer.
3214020	3216903	And what's... So why is Skype okay?
3217023	3218344	Is it because it's a Microsoft product?
3218364	3218684	I don't know.
3219125	3221006	Why is Skype okay when all this other stuff isn't?
3221046	3221767	It is Microsoft.
3221907	3222588	Microsoft bought Skype.
3222928	3224669	Yeah, it is now.
3224769	3226529	Obviously, it didn't start as one for a long time.
3227209	3229470	It's touting Skype.
3229870	3234031	Oh, you can Skype your other Xbox One plane-owning individuals.
3234151	3236972	Well, that's just the same voice and video chat they've already had on their network.
3237092	3240013	If you go to Skype.com, you have that whole Metro look.
3241374	3250406	And to go on yet another tangent away from what the story was supposed to be about, but I can't help myself, Skype, very controversial patch coming soon to Skype.
3250586	3256694	And the 6.1 patch that's due out in December, they are going to block third-party apps.
3257535	3264180	and this is very controversial because many people record their podcasts over Skype using a program like CallGraph.
3264840	3268082	We actually did Horde House with that for a while or Pamela, I think one is called.
3268422	3271825	There's all these different programs people use in Skype to do their podcasts.
3272165	3275207	They're going to be screwed because Skype is disabling access to this.
3275407	3285434	Oh, I've kind of figured you would have meant things like there's a lot of instant messaging apps that can use Skype for text messaging but not voice and video calls.
3285822	3289144	Yeah, so it's a very controversial thing going into effect.
3289444	3290504	Thank you, Xbox One.
3304611	3306032	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3333105	3334547	My old laptop had all that too.
3334627	3338372	That's actually how I used to record BBC Radio 1.
3338492	3339033	Yeah.
3339313	3340434	I'd record interviews off of that.
3340615	3340815	Nice.
3341195	3341536	Very nice.
3341916	3343578	So, yeah, Nintendo Crossplay.
3347603	3348945	No, it's a good thing.
3348985	3349125	And I...
3350747	3352468	You know who does Nintendo best?
3353188	3353729	Nintendo.
3354089	3357572	So I'm looking forward to seeing what they do with this.
3357672	3360554	And I think Smash Brothers seems like the obvious candidate.
3361014	3364957	What's going to be that synergy between the 3DS and the Wii U version that we don't know about yet?
3364997	3366518	There's definitely going to be something there.
3366979	3367499	What is it?
3368279	3368740	Don't know yet.
3369200	3370941	We'll find out.
3371322	3372222	There's that part of me...
3373183	3392734	tinfoil hat mode going a very similar direction to what Loki's saying is that oh well you know soon you're gonna be able to play 3DS games on the Wii U I kind of think because you know we got the 2DS this year which you know it's a thing it's a new system did I tell you I played one of those this week I don't think I did one of my friends has a 2DS and I played the 2DS this week
3393938	3401248	Next year, we ought to be due for some type of new handheld out of Nintendo, right?
3401569	3405634	I mean, even though we don't need one per se, that isn't going to stop them from making one.
3406235	3410761	What if they make some type of 3DS that can double as, wait for it, a Wii U touchpad?
3412025	3415931	because there's all the outcry out there for how can I buy a second touchpad?
3415972	3416432	How can I do it?
3416512	3418456	What if the second touchpad is a 3DS?
3418656	3421721	We also need something in the portable consoles that supports the Nintendo Network.
3422042	3422342	Why not?
3422403	3423725	Because the 3DS still does front codes.
3426182	3427942	Yes, but at least it's a universal friend code.
3428002	3428182	Sure.
3428582	3431964	Yeah, I mean, the system's a hell of a lot better than the original DS.
3432004	3435465	It's just the fact that we haven't seen an firmware update yet.
3435685	3439446	Obviously, we still can in the next year, but especially for Smash Bros.
3439926	3447249	and what they want to continue to do down the road, their portable system needs to come in line and start supporting these same things that the Wii U does.
3448056	3452100	Codeman in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, Rob, is the screen too small?
3452500	3453341	It doesn't have to be.
3453481	3456864	And I'm not saying they're going to make this giant 3DS as big as one of those touchpads.
3457244	3458305	What has to be the same?
3458505	3461168	The resolution has to be the same, not the size.
3462566	3464828	So it's very possible that could happen.
3465969	3468130	I'm tinfoil hatting and making shit up, admittedly.
3468471	3468791	Why not?
3468831	3471973	It's rumor week on OLR because it's that week in gaming news.
3472053	3472674	So there you go.
3473515	3474876	It's rumor week.
3475016	3476057	That's right, rumors.
3476757	3482302	Some other podcasters in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com with some advice for people that are going to get screwed with the Skype changes.
3483302	3486805	Ranma says, use a USB mixer and audition for podcasting.
3487385	3489087	Blackwolf says, I use two sound cards.
3489627	3491269	So there's other ways to do it.
3492560	3494322	Alrighty, let's move on with some more news.
3494362	3494842	DarkSakura.
3496083	3503589	Well, in other news, there is a day one patch for the PS4 that's 300 megabytes and it's adding some interesting things.
3505211	3517941	It's going to add in the remote play, which means that the titles will be displayed on the TV and you can use the Vita to connect to them.
3518742	3520863	The second screen, basically, the Vita.
3522024	3527550	You can record, take screenshots, upload different videos that you've taken.
3529051	3531353	You can watch other people play games.
3531394	3532234	You need Twitch mode.
3533996	3535618	You can play as you download.
3535658	3537600	You have multiple logins up to four people.
3538380	3541804	Voice chat, you have facial recognition and voice commands.
3541844	3542885	This is if you have the camera.
3543825	3548087	Um, background music player, online multiplayer, and the Blu-ray and DVD player.
3548827	3551649	So, they're basically going, oops, all this stuff, here you go.
3552889	3559752	So, I mean, I see no reason to be upset about that, except that, you know, I mean, 300 meg isn't really that big.
3560193	3563374	It's just basically saying, oh, we have this functionality, now we're unlocking it.
3563574	3563914	There you go.
3564434	3564835	Have fun.
3565295	3565575	Party.
3566135	3566475	Literally.
3567436	3568656	Because we have party mode.
3569497	3570997	You can talk to your friends and call them assholes.
3571798	3572138	I wouldn't.
3572378	3573079	Thanks for watching!
3589836	3592440	Who cares if I can download a title and play partway?
3592600	3594102	I don't have internet, so it doesn't matter to me.
3595664	3598307	So that's the only thing that's kind of lame about that.
3598527	3604515	But yeah, a lot of people nowadays have internet, so they could probably download it one way or another.
3604856	3605857	As long as I think is...
3606798	3632690	as long as they support being able to download that off of a storage device or something like that so you can go to your friend's house, download it onto a USB stick and pop it into your PS4 or something like that like you can right now with the PlayStation 3 then that might not be so bad if someone doesn't actually have internet then they could just go somewhere else and get it but if it's like the Xbox 360 or something usually you can't do that, you have to burn a disc or something
3633050	3634412	There is a part of me – sorry, Jamie.
3634452	3642880	There is a part of me that wonders like, well, those poor people that are going to buy this system mostly for the Blu-ray playback are going to get screwed because they can't connect to the internet.
3642900	3643981	But then I go, well, wait a minute.
3644261	3652288	When those people just get a PlayStation 3 because they're still on the market and they're going to be cheaper, like these early adopters have got to be techie people in the first place, right?
3653089	3653369	Yeah.
3653490	3656072	I don't think this news is super bad or – it's –
3657474	3659156	It's an inconvenience.
3659316	3663763	And to be fair, at least the update's a lot smaller than the Wii U one.
3663783	3670833	300 megs, I mean, fuck, that's half the size of the DLC for Saints Row 4, and you're getting way more replay value out of that.
3671846	3672367	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3691147	3692668	Jason, I'm sure they already do that.
3692768	3702012	Like, if you were to ask them those types of questions at Best Buy, like, you know, how could I switch between my Xbox and my PlayStation or whatever, I'm sure Geek Squad would be happy to come out there and hook it all up for you.
3702272	3707294	I always have to wave off that stupid $3 disc insurance thing whenever I buy a game.
3707395	3716279	Or Grandma, you know, I want to set up Netflix on the Wii for my kid and they literally don't know how to do it because, you know, I could see where there's a small market for that.
3716299	3718039	Yeah, Ranma says they do that now.
3718800	3719140	Yeah.
3719800	3741640	I had a feeling but there's a few other things with this one thing that will not be available at launch is the suspend resume mode that's supposed to basically use the low power state and take you back into your game but they said there's more to come on that in the future there's also a PlayStation app that's going to be out on November 13th in North America and the 22nd of November in Europe
3742403	3742703	DarkSakura
3768783	3781805	that's it I mean it's just like hey I bought this car I heard all these great things about the wheels it has oh fuck it doesn't have wheels damn no we can't have that and we will continue to not have that for the foreseeable decades
3784359	3795588	Without devolving on yet another tangent, this is one of those things that there's very much an argument to the success of Valve in the sense that they don't tout everything until it's there.
3795989	3798070	Valve has not said a word about Half-Life 3.
3798631	3800492	We know nothing of what Half-Life 3 will be.
3801213	3809179	If and when it finally gets here, there's no expectations other than it's got to be better than the second game, and there's a good chance that that's going to happen.
3809339	3810981	Is Valve a publicly traded company?
3811701	3812061	and DarkSakura.com
3832560	3855952	it's a really really tangled web because at the same time more often than not company stocks sink during news announcements or at least maybe the most popular ones like Amazon, Apple and possibly also Microsoft but that's not an uncommon trend which seems to say why do we even bother going through this media hype only to have bad news once we get to the end of it
3858775	3860936	Alright, well, is that it, DarkSakura?
3860956	3861376	Do you have more?
3861436	3866759	No, I actually had more to say about the app, but I didn't get it out.
3866879	3868059	It's Tangent-y tonight.
3868079	3868620	Yeah, I know.
3869380	3878685	The app itself, what it's supposed to do is it lets you access the PlayStation Network, your friends list, your trophies, but it also is to act as a second screen for games that support it.
3879285	3881686	So, I wanted to get that out.
3883044	3883284	Awesome.
3883324	3884444	For people who don't know.
3884664	3890826	I just hope the servers don't all get hammered the first day and the damn thing takes forever to download like what happened on Wii U. Are you being prophetic?
3891146	3891986	Well, just saying.
3892106	3892406	They will.
3892706	3893246	I'm sure they will.
3893266	3894266	You just jinxed them, Rob.
3894286	3894607	Thank you.
3894947	3895847	Thanks, Rob.
3896307	3896467	No.
3896647	3899288	This is like one of the first rules of the internet.
3899428	3900628	This stuff always happens.
3900668	3901188	Here we go.
3901508	3902228	Here's how they can do this.
3902308	3902608	Okay.
3903348	3904929	Put up the patch now on their website.
3904989	3906209	Download it to the fucking thumb drive.
3906389	3906629	Thank you.
3906649	3907329	Why don't they just do that?
3907389	3907889	Thank you.
3908110	3909970	That would be a great idea, actually.
3910877	3912977	Hey, we know our servers are probably going to get hammered at launch.
3913298	3915738	Hey, you want to be a little bit imprimptive about it?
3915758	3916718	Put it on fucking BitTorrent.
3916818	3917979	Put a BitTorrent out there.
3918039	3920079	Then it won't even be on their servers.
3921779	3922780	I don't know about that.
3923920	3925400	Yeah, I'm just saying.
3926200	3926660	You could.
3929841	3931981	That's a little too controversial for them.
3932061	3933682	But then hackers would tear that shit apart.
3933702	3935242	They're going to tear it apart anyway.
3935582	3936922	What are they going to do with it?
3937543	3939183	It's just going to take them five minutes longer.
3939980	3943145	Figure out that much faster how to install Linux on it, I guess.
3943366	3945289	They've already done it to the toaster, so don't get me started.
3958314	3960716	Okay, so a little bit more about the PlayStation 4.
3961456	3966659	There were some details coming out about the digital games and some of the benefits you get with PlayStation Plus.
3966699	3972443	For example, digital games, you can actually share your account with two consoles.
3972743	3977466	So you have one console that you deem your primary console that kind of operates the way I see it.
3977486	3978526	It's similar to like...
3979867	3981308	DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4002145	4005748	You can also use two systems concurrently.
4006208	4011292	So the system activated is your primary PS4 and one other system that you're logged into.
4012313	4028305	So that, to me, sounds like if I get Grand Theft Auto V for the PlayStation 4 or something like that, or whatever, and I have the digital download for, like... I download it to my system, and then I...
4029266	4029806	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4048258	4054262	If everybody's in the same household, you can have those guest accounts, which are the same gamertag with the 1, 2, 3 appended to it.
4054602	4058065	I think that's what you're thinking of, but certainly not across two consoles in different locations.
4058185	4069612	No, it sounds like... Well, I mean, it sounds similar to what... I think, didn't you guys have to do something like that with Mass Effect or something, where you'd play on one console and log in with the other person's thing?
4069712	4070673	I don't know.
4070973	4073394	They've kind of done this right now, I want to say, with...
4075538	4076058	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4102686	4106728	So, they started limiting that down to, I think now it's down to two.
4107468	4108688	And I think that's what they have here.
4108888	4112110	So, you could exploit that, but I don't think it's meant for that.
4112130	4115151	It's more of like, you know, I'm going to my friend's house or something.
4115171	4120153	Yeah, it's more like you are going to go to your friends and play one game, but your little brother is still at home playing your PlayStation 4.
4120793	4122994	Like, it's more like that kind of situation, right?
4123214	4123734	I think so.
4124174	4125595	Two is pretty reasonable.
4126055	4127535	Yeah, I think that's how it's supposed to be.
4128956	4129636	Oh, here we go.
4129696	4131697	It says, let's see.
4133756	4134998	That graphic is clear as mud.
4151064	4153465	Yeah, that is... I don't understand what the fuck they're talking about.
4154425	4156425	A system that is activated as a primary.
4157825	4159066	Yeah, you had it right.
4159246	4159826	Don't get it.
4160066	4161646	I think that's... Yeah, I think I had it right.
4162106	4162686	You had it right.
4162846	4167987	You can... You, with your account, with your PlayStation Network account, can download things to the console.
4168368	4172108	As soon as it's on the console, anybody else can take advantage of that locally.
4172588	4174969	Nobody else can start a download using your account.
4175989	4178130	It's pretty expected.
4178751	4188236	Some other random details that were released, I guess, that the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One both support up to eight people in party chat.
4188356	4189157	Now, here's my question.
4189197	4191938	How many does the Xbox 360 support now in party chat?
4191958	4193879	Because I think it's quite a few people.
4194160	4194620	I think eight.
4194980	4195440	You think six?
4195460	4196321	I thought it was only six.
4196761	4200883	I seem to remember it's a full game limited to four plus just two more.
4201744	4202184	Could be wrong.
4202284	4203785	It's been forever since I've used that.
4205200	4232383	I don't know because I know I've had a lot of people in party chat before but I don't remember I haven't really counted there's no it worked so it'd be interesting hopefully it's the same or more you know yeah and he said party voice chat will support eight players like on PlayStation 4 like from support.xbox.com a party can contain up to eight people once the maximum attendance is reached someone must leave the party before another person can join
4233991	4236453	That's the GTFO our party right now.
4236513	4237714	We want someone cool.
4239256	4239816	Get out.
4240497	4241778	We have no cake for you.
4242339	4250906	I was gonna say, like, eight seems right because, like, isn't, like, a Forza Horizon match, like, eight people and, like, a lot of Xbox Live stuff is, like, eight people, I think.
4251127	4251667	So, anyway.
4252068	4252388	Alright.
4253949	4254290	That's it.
4255663	4257744	Bravely Default for the Sequel Bravely Default for the Sequel
4278818	4284362	Bravely Second will have time-stopping antics, which were in the original game.
4284922	4288505	But it relies on what's called SP, special power.
4289405	4291507	Once you use this power, your SP decreases.
4291927	4296731	You can gain SP when you put your 3DS in sleep mode, but it's a little bit slow.
4296771	4298352	It's like regening mana in EverQuest.
4298392	4299272	It's very, very slow.
4299773	4302755	One SP point is added for every eight hours of idle time.
4303535	4304136	But guess what?
4304176	4304936	If you don't want to wait...
4305817	4310041	You can buy potions on the 3DS eShop that refill your SP.
4310742	4313605	I've seen that model before on a Facebook game.
4316207	4316527	Yuck.
4316808	4320631	Well, we keep telling Nintendo they need to learn the internet, so where better to turn to?
4320651	4322193	This is not the place to do it.
4322273	4324415	I don't think this is actually a Nintendo game, however.
4325256	4325336	Um...
4326863	4327403	We don't know.
4327844	4332926	Producer Tomoya Asano assures fans that this will be a good thing.
4333186	4333547	Of course.
4333927	4338589	Quote, Bravely Second isn't a demerit, but a system that gives players an advantage.
4339009	4340970	It's convenient and it's very powerful.
4341291	4344332	So in other words, it's for people that want to cheat, I guess is what I'm reading in that.
4344452	4347574	And so if you want to like, you can buy cheats, essentially.
4347874	4350275	This game is out in Japan in December.
4351516	4353437	I don't know if it's coming out here.
4353957	4355178	I haven't heard anything about it.
4358328	4359128	I'm trying to see.
4359729	4362810	Bravely Default Western release includes updated for the sequel.
4362890	4364911	We had the first one.
4366271	4372113	So, Bravely Default, I'm switching my internal clock to make it look like it's a day later.
4372213	4373834	Oh, look, there's all my energy back.
4373874	4377575	Yeah, I wonder if people would be able to time travel and trick the thing that way.
4377875	4380657	Another article on the site says that it's going to be out in North America in 2014.
4380697	4380997	Oh, thank you.
4384853	4386393	I didn't play the first one, I gotta be honest.
4386413	4388934	But I did hear about it, and some people seem to enjoy it.
4391775	4401298	I really hope that this is something that truly, not just because the dude says it is, truly has no impact on the game if I were to not use it.
4401398	4407399	In other words, I could still beat the game start to finish without too much hassle, without even touching this stuff.
4407419	4408400	Because that would just be shitty.
4410080	4411482	I don't really have another word for it.
4411602	4413405	One point for every eight hours, though.
4413505	4418232	On any scale of any RPG I've ever played, that's ludicrously small.
4418933	4422077	Let's assume something's 15 points.
4422117	4424661	That's what, four days of idle before you recharge that?
4425883	4426464	It's ridiculous.
4426949	4430771	Shane's telling me we haven't had the first one, but I'm looking at it right here on Amazon for sale.
4430811	4431591	Or is this an import?
4432571	4433632	That's just Japanese.
4434232	4434892	I got fooled.
4435192	4435953	It has a really pretty art.
4437433	4438774	So you know somebody that imported it?
4439074	4439674	I guess so.
4441235	4446497	As if there's not plenty of people around this table that's ever done something like that for a game before.
4447658	4450619	All right, let's move on before we get to release dates, DarkSakura.
4451908	4458532	We have, remember last week we talked about, was it last week I think, that Nintendo wasn't going to be making Wii for Japan anymore?
4459732	4463554	This is Wii, not the Wii U. Well, it's already been confirmed as well for Europe.
4465015	4475300	They are going to be producing no more for the European markets, and Nintendo of the UK said that the consumers who don't own a Wii can still buy a Wii Mini instead.
4476000	4496970	that's the lower price point that has a bunch of the stuff missing it's all using DLC sorry it's only disc based games and no deals no download titles and no backwards compatibility but no word for the US yet there was a second body type for the Wii
4497697	4499158	I don't know if the Mini ever did.
4499178	4499458	Canada.
4499478	4501520	Canada got the red one, of course.
4501540	4502580	But I don't think it ever came out in the U.S.,
4527637	4528879	I missed all of this news.
4529460	4530421	It's just crap.
4530461	4534547	Seriously, if you're gonna save money on a Wii, buy a used Wii.
4535548	4539394	Why bother wasting money on a brand new piece of shit that doesn't do anything?
4541495	4546941	The Wii does have a huge game library though for people that might want to get one for a younger person.
4548203	4549604	Entry level gaming console or whatever.
4550305	4558515	And really the Wii was only good for me for one thing and that was weather and Wii News and I can't do that anymore because the news channel doesn't work.
4560497	4565621	I checked that every... It's funny that you mentioned that because I kind of liked those channels for a very long time.
4565981	4570485	There's always something wrong with the news channel and yeah, I don't know.
4570625	4573727	I found easier... Oh, no, I know what happened.
4573887	4580592	I found an iPhone and then having to go back to a console on my TV was not exactly as important or convenient anymore.
4580833	4586657	I just can't believe that I waited in line for that except that I hung out with Kristen the whole time and it was pretty fun and we got donuts.
4587085	4589649	It was alright in the beginning.
4589990	4591692	Excite Truck was awesome.
4592333	4593595	You're still mad about Excitebots.
4593615	4596840	I am still fucking... I am furious about Excitebots.
4597942	4598323	Seriously.
4599249	4605770	Who on the face of the earth thought, hey, let's put a minigame in the middle of a fucking race, and that's a great idea?
4606170	4606551	I don't know.
4606571	4608191	I want to punch them in the goddamn face.
4608291	4613972	Like, for some reason, it's become like a trend on Twitter lately to really hate on the Twilight Princess as part of the Zelda series.
4614032	4618953	But, I mean, that game was like the shit when it first came out on the Nintendo Wii.
4619013	4620673	I mean, just kind of what it did.
4620753	4622534	And I named my cat after her.
4624054	4626856	and kind of like, you know, what that brought to the table for gaming in general.
4628136	4632819	So I guess, you know, now if you go back and play it now, it's a little bit like, oh, this is very linear.
4633159	4635540	But I mean, it was great at the time.
4636641	4638462	Yeah, the Wii brought a lot of great games.
4638542	4638802	Come on.
4639582	4640342	All right, let's move on.
4640402	4646144	We've got to travel around the world and check out some release dates and what's coming out near you soon.
4646584	4646804	Yes.
4647444	4651646	So this week, actually a lot of games, but no particular order here.
4651726	4658047	Monster High 13 Wishes for Girls on the Wii and Wii U, 3DS and DS.
4659308	4666350	They're also doing some collections of games, XCOM and Civ V, the 2K definitive strategy collection on PC.
4667750	4685777	Sonic Lost World on 3DS and Wii U, Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures, the game that sort of resembles some of the 3D Sonic games and based on some new animated TV series, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii and Wii U and 3DS I believe.
4687217	4688798	The Game Stick is finally coming out.
4690771	4691272	and no one cared.
4692353	4696957	The 2K Power Pack Collection with Darkness 2.
4696997	4699099	Actually, that might be the first Darkness.
4699880	4704284	The Darkness Mafia 2 and Bioshock.
4705565	4706466	I have to make sure here.
4706486	4707687	I can't read this.
4708568	4710309	Bioshock 2, Darkness 2 and Mafia 2.
4710370	4713993	Those are coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
4716124	4732856	Battlefield 4 on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC this week Angry Birds Star Wars on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, Wii U, 3DS, and Vita Beyblade Evolution on 3DS
4734577	4741143	Assassin's Creed 4 Black Flag on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii U, and no PC.
4741623	4747529	That's coming out later because we can't get their release dates coordinated for the PC versions.
4749150	4752553	WWE 2K14 on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
4752613	4752934	What else here?
4759656	4762098	Transformers Ultimate Battle Edition re-released there.
4762218	4764220	Also, Ultimate Autobots Edition.
4765321	4768064	And... There's one last one here.
4770025	4771827	I have more Angry Birds.
4772187	4775190	Doodle Jump for 3DS.
4775330	4775750	Yay!
4776071	4777712	Yeah, 3DS and DS.
4777752	4780034	Doodle Jump.
4781295	4782056	And then...
4785651	4794015	Also, I think on Friday, I think that's the first, they're going to have a Wii Remote Plus for Luigi and Mario.
4795355	4797596	Alrighty, because that's cool and all.
4798656	4811542	I wanted to add, this is kind of funny, because I don't know if they even talked next-gen release dates yet, but Call of Duty Ghosts on all formats will be coming out on the 5th.
4811842	4812382	That's right.
4812862	4814323	You can get Call of Duty Ghosts
4815283	4819307	2 weeks before the system that comes out to play it on the Xbox One.
4839847	4842448	Alright, let's take a look at Japan and what's coming out in Japan.
4842488	4845049	They're getting their releases on Halloween the 31st.
4845789	4848110	The FPS Pad 3 Strike Gear.
4848130	4849410	I think that's actually an accessory.
4849450	4850131	Sorry, that's not a game.
4851051	4854192	But you can get a Mahjong game called Dankyu Battle 3.
4854232	4856013	It comes out this week on the PlayStation 3.
4856673	4863258	Tears to Tiara 2, How No Matsue comes out in a first print limited edition, if you're so inclined.
4863598	4867902	And then Vampire Resurrection, just in time for Halloween, gets a price reduction.
4868402	4869803	So there you go on the PlayStation 3.
4870063	4873005	On the Xbox 360, there is really nothing this week.
4873045	4877369	You can get that same little FPS pad thing I talked about before.
4877689	4878289	That's really it.
4879650	4903909	on the PlayStation Vita this week Gundam Breaker and there is also a new slim model because I believe those Vita slims those just came out in Japan like last couple weeks ago or one of them right there's a Gundam Breaker Vita pack if you're so inclined so that's out also Chu Jijijen Gemu Neptune Rebirth 1 in regular and limited edition is out on the Vita as well
4904969	4906430	on the Wii U this week.
4906530	4909071	Yes, there is some Wii U stuff in Japan this week.
4909491	4912493	Wii Party U is one of the big games coming out.
4912873	4921977	And then there's some stuff that's centered around, it looks like Wii Fit U, but is that available for download on the 31st?
4922137	4923778	I don't remember how that whole thing was going down.
4923798	4925619	Remember you could download it a month early or something?
4925699	4932222	Yeah, you're supposed to be able to download it a month early, and I know that next, not next week, but the week after next, those stupid Wii Fit
4932802	4934884	and DarkSakura.com.
4954338	4959786	Oh yeah, looks like there's a new bundle in Japan that's 32 gigs, Black Wii U, with Mario Bros.
4959967	4966035	U, Wii Party U, Wii Fit U, a Wiimote, and the whole little sensor bar thing.
4966055	4969701	And it comes with one of the little portable walk...
4970201	4971522	What are those called?
4972382	4974323	They look like Tamagotchis, for God's sake.
4974343	4975844	They're little Wii U Tamagotchis.
4976984	4977605	But it's you.
4977725	4979746	That's straight up the pocket station right there.
4980066	4980346	Right?
4981506	4983967	They've got a hefty little bundle there in Japan out this week.
4986108	4986388	All right.
4987489	4987969	Let's see.
4988369	4995190	Also, moving on to the Nintendo 3DS, Danball Senki Wars is out this week.
4996091	5002372	And Chara Petsukute Sodatete, character Shogaku, comes out this week.
5002912	5008774	And that's just cute little animals, including a pink panda who has hearts for ears.
5009614	5010354	Oh, that's adorable.
5011034	5012195	That's it for Japanese releases.
5012215	5013295	How about the UK, DarkSakura?
5013863	5024206	In the UK, we have on the 29th of October, WWE K-14, on the 31st, Football Manager 2014 for PC and Mac, and Toki Tori.
5026306	5026806	Excuse me.
5027446	5033028	On November 1st, there's Angry Birds Star Wars for damn near everything, and Angry Birds Star Wars 2 for damn near every console.
5033788	5042370	Assassin's Creed 4, Black Flag, Battlefield 4, Blur Overdrive for iPad and iPhone, and Wii Fit U.
5043905	5047267	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5064558	5069704	Instead of Nintendo Land being in there, they're kind of updating the whole SKU with now new Super Mario Bros.
5069904	5080797	U and the DLC new Super Luigi U. So you'll be able to get that for $2.99 this holiday starting, I believe, the end of next week.
5083560	5084240	Be pretty fast.
5084320	5095170	And then also, even though it is leaving shelves in a couple other regions, the Wii will still be around in the US.
5095650	5103036	And basically the announcement of the Wii console being discontinued is specific to Japan, well now Europe.
5103196	5108421	There's no change of status in the Wii in the United States and is available for purchase this holiday season.
5111294	5113255	Metal Gear Rising will be getting a PlayStation 3 special edition.
5129543	5158719	it's a DLC bundled PlayStation 3 re-release that's going to come out later this year for Metal Gear Rising and it's the Revengeance Special Edition it will have Blade Wolf and Jetstream DLC packs 30 VR missions 5 alternate costumes and a custom PlayStation 3 theme you can check all that out on December 5th and it's also going to be available as a download on PlayStation Network as most of the game releases are don't know yet if this is coming out stateside
5159199	5161260	This is only confirmed for Japan as of right now.
5162241	5164142	Speaking of PlayStation, I have another quick story.
5164202	5168023	This is about a whole little PlayStation bundle.
5169384	5170305	This is interesting.
5170525	5174807	A Gran Turismo 6 bundle that's going to come out in Brazil.
5175827	5182371	It's an... I'm going to mispronounce this name, and I apologize because he passed away in 1994, but he was a very famous racer.
5182951	5184632	Ayrton Senna.
5185152	5186233	I hope I didn't mispronounce that.
5186273	5186973	I apologize if I did.
5187713	5192734	But he's going to be featured as part of this Gran Turismo 6 bundle that's coming out.
5193114	5196835	And it's supposed to actually kind of like help charity, which is pretty cool.
5196995	5204557	I'm assuming that part of the proceeds of the bundle actually go to the institute set up in this guy's name that helps to educate.
5204577	5205157	So that's pretty cool.
5205918	5208338	This is on December 6th that this is coming out in Brazil.
5208358	5211099	It comes out with Gran Turismo 6, a 250 gigabyte PlayStation 3, and one controller.
5211119	5211199	So...
5216281	5217424	That's very cool.
5218326	5224399	One other reason I bring this up is that I don't know if you guys saw, but apparently the PlayStation 4 is going to cost oodles and oodles of money in Brazil.
5225196	5225857	Did you hear about that?
5226017	5228159	It kind of doesn't surprise me, though.
5228219	5229680	Yeah, everything costs more over there.
5229800	5233323	Yeah, I know, but it's like on the scale of $1,500 or something.
5233483	5238508	When you convert the money, it's a really high price.
5239729	5243072	I bet there will be people that just somehow get one from the U.S.
5243152	5245514	or another place and import them for way less.
5245734	5246595	But it's taxes.
5246795	5249778	The thing is, taxes really affect the price.
5249798	5251239	It's not that they're marking it up.
5251319	5252380	People get them illegally.
5254136	5254416	All right.
5255277	5259920	Let's travel back to a time when Gran Turismo 5 wasn't even out.
5260020	5262341	Heck, I don't even think the original Gran Turismo was out.
5262842	5266464	In fact, some people would still agree that Gran Turismo 5 is not out yet.
5266624	5268585	That's the joke I was trying to make unsuccessfully.
5269566	5277131	But it's time for DarkSakura to step into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, hey, you should, like, play this now and stuff.
5277211	5278231	You're going to roll your eyes.
5278512	5281053	I'm totally going to roll my eyes at this week's...
5284025	5285246	Don't do anything for Shane.
5285266	5286026	That was the first mistake.
5286046	5288387	I am doing something for Shane so that he will help me level.
5288627	5289928	You're only making him stronger.
5289948	5290368	That's right.
5290388	5293170	You're only making his horrible powers stronger.
5293710	5294751	Shane, don't listen to them.
5294931	5296051	You have good taste in music.
5296632	5300314	All right, DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week?
5300614	5301694	It's Pokemon Red and Blue.
5303495	5304336	Don't laugh.
5304376	5305156	These aren't classics.
5305176	5305957	Don't judge me.
5306837	5308018	You're totally judging me right now.
5309338	5310059	Maybe a little bit.
5311980	5312320	Anyway.
5314588	5320891	So anyway, this was developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo for the Game Boy.
5321291	5323332	And this came out in 1996.
5324773	5327074	Actually, in Japan, they came out as Red and Green.
5327714	5330075	And Blue was released as a special edition.
5330575	5335077	Then they were released as Red and Blue in North America, Europe, and Australia over the next three years.
5335177	5340620	Pokemon Yellow is a special version that was basically like, hi, here's Pikachu.
5341340	5347302	Both have been remade, by the way, as Pokemon FireRed and LeafGreen that came out in 2004.
5348022	5357004	So basically, overhead perspective, you go through the fictional area of Kanto, and you basically abuse your poor little animals and make Peeta cry.
5357024	5359725	I'm kidding, because that was a fake.
5360225	5366006	But you basically pit your animals against each other and see who is the greatest.
5366727	5367547	Of course, you know...
5369028	5373793	I love how in Japan the game was more marketed as with the adventure and everything.
5373853	5377717	And yeah, the collection thing was a part of it, but it's like blatant commercialism out here.
5378057	5379018	Gotta catch them all!
5379498	5380980	Like rabies or something, I don't know.
5381901	5387847	So anyway, you have to fight the different gym leaders and you collect badges and you beat the game like that.
5388868	5389208	So, uh...
5391370	5395853	Other things about this game is that you have a little thing in there called the Pokédex.
5396514	5407181	And basically for the first game you had 150 available Pokémon and you could keep track of all of them that you catch in your Pokédex and you still had to deal with Team Rocket.
5407981	5415726	You could also use your GameLink cable to connect your games together and let you trade and battle between games, which my husband and I did quite a bit.
5416927	5419128	I believe Dan played Red and I played Blue.
5419729	5428935	Then there was the 151st Pokemon Mew that you could only get through official distribution by Nintendo.
5429555	5434378	or buy a glitch and I won't say anything about getting it that way because I got it.
5436140	5438341	Honestly though I used... The Nintendo police are coming to your house right now.
5439382	5442184	Whatever, they're a little late.
5442444	5453931	So yeah, I mean basically IGN ranked it as one of the top 100 games of all time and in 2009 it was in the Guinness Book of World Records as best-selling RPG on Game Boy and best-selling RPG on time.
5455553	5467107	So basically you have the third person overhead view but when you're in your battles it switches to a behind the back of your whatever Pokemon that you're playing and you can change them out.
5467127	5467988	You have up to six.
5468609	5469470	You cannot teach...
5471232	5474933	You know, Pokemon who have wings, you have to teach them how to fly.
5475253	5476594	I mean, really, what's up with that?
5477394	5479434	You get experience, you level them up.
5480555	5487177	You also can get some of the most useless piece of crap Pokemon ever, like Magikarp.
5487677	5495139	But, Magikarp turns into Gyarados, and I have gone through the entire game with Gyarados, and I haven't even anything else.
5495399	5501991	The first time I did that whole wonder trade on Pokemon X and Y, somebody sent me a fucking Magikarp.
5502552	5505016	But of course it was Japanese Magikarps, that made it a little cooler.
5507120	5507520	Oh, Rob.
5508664	5525178	Anyway, as far as other elements in the game, you do also have the capturing aspect where you can find Pokemon in the wild and you can put them into a life of eternal servitude living in little balls for the rest of their existence.
5525959	5530624	Like little animal genies that come out and do cage fighting for you.
5531184	5532866	Yeah.
5534247	5540753	And to also say something about something that was mentioned in the last game, Pikachu is the breed, not its name.
5540813	5542495	It's like calling your dog, Dog.
5543095	5544997	It's like calling your cat, Cat.
5545558	5546919	I had a cat named Mr. Cat.
5547239	5548340	That was a little bit more respectful.
5548681	5549822	It'd be like saying Pikachu-san.
5550802	5553864	So anyway, there have been other versions, of course.
5554524	5556966	There were gold, silver, and crystal.
5557006	5558366	That was a second generation.
5559387	5566591	And using the transfer pack on Nintendo 64, you could actually use items from your red and blue in Pokemon Stadium and Pokemon Stadium 2.
5568052	5570673	However, they were not compatible with the advanced generation.
5571773	5575716	Which, I actually had Pokemon Stadium, but I kind of didn't play it much.
5576756	5582459	Um, really the best part about Pokemon Stadium was like, just watching your Pokemon come out and do their little poses and then it got boring.
5583479	5585660	Um, I love seeing Shrew.
5586441	5588822	Anyway, I'm looking over the shoulder.
5589272	5591373	So the setting of the game takes place in Kanto.
5593173	5601336	And it's got different habitats for the different Pokemon, different towns and cities, and routes that connect them all to each other.
5602096	5606458	And you can get some of them only by fishing.
5606518	5609019	You can get stuff like a Zubat only in the cave.
5609699	5612240	So you're sent out by Professor Oak.
5613500	5619443	Um, who, uh, lets you pick one, and then, um, you are in a rivalry with Oak's grandson.
5620504	5623465	And, uh, who, what was his name, Gary?
5624866	5629928	Um, cause I remember, cause the character in Japan was actually named after Miyamoto, his name was Shigeru.
5631089	5631689	So, um...
5633896	5642940	There's also a rumor that we were supposed to get a version of, that there had been an intention to do a version of Green that had a female trainer.
5643721	5646722	But that, you know, that's still on the rumor mill.
5647162	5650363	Anyway, you can start off with Bulbasaur, Squirtle, or Charmander.
5650884	5653425	And yeah, my first game playthrough is Bulbasaur.
5653565	5657987	Every other time I've ever, you know, I switched to Red and was like Charmander all the way because I didn't care.
5658847	5661008	Um, but uh, my first playthrough was with Bulbasaur.
5662028	5671372	And uh, basically you uh, eventually have to fight the Elite Four, and the new champion who is, boom, your rival, so you have to kick their ass.
5672032	5683077	So the whole concept of Pokemon started, and I don't know how many people um, know about this, that um, the designer Satoshi Tajiri was an insect collector.
5684117	5700729	and uh so basically he wanted to give that same feeling of discovery of capture of you know collection like that of live specimens into a game that wouldn't people could play anytime you wouldn't necessarily have to live out in the country for it
5701589	5714513	Um, you know, he was noticing that kids played more in their homes instead of outside, so he wanted to sort of give people the feeling of being able to grow up in the outside environment, and like I said, that sense of discovery.
5715614	5722976	Um, he also did not want to make games that had more, as he said, pointless violence, even though he's having animals fight each other.
5722996	5723276	Okay.
5723946	5732929	So, um, I mean, basically, uh, that was the other one I was trying to remember, is that the character that you play as is named Satoshi, after, you know, himself.
5733289	5735490	And of course his rival is Shikaru, after Miyamoto.
5736450	5749314	So, um, it's really, you know, there's so much more about this, you know, a lot of history that went into the, um, production of the game, like, um,
5752424	5765912	They even made some different audio advancements by using different sounds in the processor to create a snare sound using basically a white noise filter in the Game Boy.
5767073	5774878	Creating the animal sounds by using the Pokemon sounds by basically making it a very short chiptune.
5776259	5782223	It was supposed to be originally called Capsule Monster, but there was a trademark issue.
5782283	5786305	They were going to call it Capomon, and basically they went to Pocket Monster, so it's Pokemon.
5787266	5795892	And it was basically rejected over and over by Nintendo until Miyamoto came out with the golden way of making it work.
5796372	5797973	So, that's why we have it.
5798994	5799074	Um...
5801596	5808153	So that's... I'm not going to go into a lot more of the detail because really there is a whole hell of a lot about this game.
5808513	5809055	But, um...
5811596	5814417	If you haven't played the original, I think you're kind of missing out.
5814517	5825079	Even if you're not a big fan of Pokemon at all today, if you don't care about the new ones, I think that if anyone wants a good, rounded-off, classic gaming background, Pokemon should be in it.
5825499	5826920	So, that's my final word.
5827540	5831981	Alright, there it is, your Classic Game of the Week, or Games of the Week, Pokemon Red and Pokemon Blue.
5832441	5834162	And you can add yellow into it because it was the same gen.
5834182	5836003	I was going to say, my first Pokemon game was yellow.
5836324	5837985	So it was the same gen.
5838545	5844489	I got the see-through, off-purple Game Boy Color and Pokemon Yellow.
5844589	5848812	Yeah, it was because of the damn anime that I loved Pokemon.
5848832	5851814	You know, I had the Japanese theme song memorized for years.
5851854	5856977	And I actually have... You know how you used to buy singles in those square cases with the little tiny disc inside?
5857378	5859719	I actually have the Niasu Sings.
5860079	5860360	Nice.
5860720	5861440	Niasu is Meowth.
5862721	5865323	So it also has the full Team Rocket song on it.
5866083	5871686	I squeed in the new Pokemon X and Y when wild Pikachus were showing up in the second zone you're in.
5871726	5873727	I was like, yes, that's the Pokemon I want to capture.
5874087	5875248	The right call.
5875508	5878690	And also, just to say, one of Shermie's nicknames was Caterpie.
5880050	5880531	Just saying.
5880731	5881211	Just saying.
5881351	5884032	It is pretty crazy to think that the games Red and Blue predated the anime.
5885072	5887233	Yeah, I know, right?
5887653	5892695	I think that the games, I think that it was more of a simultaneous thing over here.
5892715	5894696	Because the anime had already been out forever.
5895116	5898597	And for the record, the Porygon episode totally did not make me have a seizure.
5900558	5900838	All right.
5901298	5902839	We're going to take a quick break, guys.
5902859	5906920	When we come back, there's plenty more OLR to come, including rapid-fire news, more emails.
5906980	5908321	I know we already had one at the top of the show.
5908341	5908981	We've got more to come.
5909381	5911102	Fugle Question of the Week and plenty, plenty more.
5911162	5913342	Your calls as well, 1-877-GAME-OLR.
5913643	5916804	We'll be back, though, after a quick break with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5917064	5917624	Don't go anywhere.
5923638	5930965	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio, live on this Sunday night with episode number 525 of our show.
5931265	5935990	That's a palindrome, and it's a multiple of 25, so therefore it's an event episode tonight.
5938072	5948782	Well, it's always an event when the awesome Jason is here with us, as he can't join us all the time, but once in a while he's in San Francisco for work and drives up the road to come say hi.
5949102	5951904	Because 22 hours to San Francisco in the first place wasn't enough.
5952265	5954186	Had to do the extra two hours up to Sacramento.
5954226	5955648	Do you wave the first time through?
5957209	5969339	I was thinking of making a surprise stop in here because I was... I don't remember if I was in Sacramento city limits or at least around the downtown area when the show started or if it was just after.
5969860	5974043	And I probably should have considering that I proceeded to take about four hours because of the traffic.
5975084	5979867	in just South Sacramento, plus the traffic in Berkeley, plus the traffic in downtown.
5979927	5981408	You drove in during the BART strike.
5984530	5985210	Congrats.
5985230	5987611	That was not a very nice end to two days worth of driving.
5987751	5988112	I bet.
5988232	5988712	Oh my gosh.
5989032	5991433	So you drove here all the way from Colorado where you live.
5991854	5994875	Do you drive nonstop and pull over and sleep?
5994895	5995736	Where do you stop?
5996116	5999139	I could do it because it's about 20-21 hours.
5999579	6003343	In this case, I left just before noon on Saturday.
6004364	6006045	Drove out to Nevada.
6006205	6007246	Stayed in Elko, Nevada.
6008047	6009268	Very small town.
6009749	6010910	About central Nevada.
6011871	6013492	And then continued the rest of the way.
6013532	6015394	The next day, I pulled into the parking lot.
6017242	6018202	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6038451	6057486	and you guys can share your opinions as well you can either do that live with us tonight live.vognetwork.com if you're listening to us on this Sunday night or of course if you're listening to us on the podcast you can always tweet at us at OLR or you can email us mailbag at orangelaunceradio.com let's check out some rapid fire news and quickly talk about a few things here Loki
6058566	6076255	Yes, so since there really hasn't been too much going on with Minecraft on the Xbox 360 as far as updates go, they have been putting out some skin packs to re-skin the whole look of Minecraft and sometimes include free levels and stuff.
6076635	6079057	They have another one coming out though for Halloween.
6079137	6085220	It kind of re-skins everything, makes another nice and green and everything very Halloween-y.
6086080	6087181	And the price of that...
6087981	6088301	Free!
6088962	6090543	So, I think you can afford that.
6091303	6092664	So go check it out if you haven't yet.
6093104	6097667	And also, creepers are nice and ghostly white now.
6097927	6098587	So that's kind of fun.
6099628	6101709	And the Slenderman's about.
6102850	6107552	Ah, yes, I'm assuming that they've redone the Enderman then to make him look like a Slenderman.
6108593	6110054	Very clever, I guess.
6110794	6117018	Alright, and then on top of that, Grand Theft Auto, since I love talking about Grand Theft Auto,
6118527	6119028	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6137549	6140470	It's going to be next week, I think, or maybe even beyond that.
6141530	6143710	The Beach Bum Pack is something that they're going to put out.
6143730	6146151	It's the first piece of DLC that's going to be free.
6146791	6150792	And it's going to add some weapons and vehicles to the game, as well as clothing items.
6150932	6153552	And that's both online and single player.
6154533	6162334	And then also, of course, the content creator for Deathmatch and Races is going to be available as well in November.
6162774	6166455	And so you'll be able to create your own Deathmatches and Deathmatch arenas.
6167095	6190475	and races in the game which I think is going to be pretty awesome when we get to do that and last but not least it's been leaked out that there is a new kind of zombie mode in the game of Call of Duty Ghosts except now instead of zombies it's extinction and extinction has to do with aliens so you're fighting off aliens instead of zombies and
6191035	6194897	and they're going to have the different type of stuff to go along with that as well.
6195477	6198199	So, interesting.
6199099	6202661	I guess we'll learn more about that pretty soon since the game comes out in two weeks.
6206062	6212408	or you can always get your PlayStation 4 one early and just look at the box and think about that alien mode, right?
6212488	6213609	Yeah, or the Xbox One.
6213949	6216231	You have extra time to contemplate the alien mode.
6216271	6216871	That's right.
6216992	6219314	Just sit there and think about it.
6219694	6222496	Killer Instinct, some more news coming out about that.
6222556	6226620	In fact, I've seen some footage coming out of those Xbox One preview events of Killer Instinct.
6226960	6228841	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6255487	6277856	apparently the highest difficulty level in the game when you're in training mode you can do very easy of course and hard and so forth but the most difficult level is something called Kyle it's apparently named on one of the development team's AI designers who is insanely good at the game so you can fight Kyle who I guess works there and is really really good at I hate you Kyle I hate you Kyle
6280349	6281690	SuperCastlevania4
6306144	6310707	is the Wii U release on Virtual Console this week on Halloween.
6311608	6313810	Now, I already had that when it was on the Wii.
6313830	6315511	Speaking of games, I have in the box.
6315571	6316031	That's right.
6316292	6320094	So I can get this for a dollar if I want to get the Wii U Virtual Console version, which I probably will.
6320235	6321295	You can come to my house and play it.
6321636	6323477	I can, but... Dude, that would be awesome.
6323657	6324958	Castlevania Fest on Halloween.
6325238	6331423	But I can't... See, what I can do in my house that I can't do at your house is play Castlevania 4 on the toilet.
6331923	6332824	I almost said in the toilet.
6333704	6334285	On the toilet.
6334696	6336467	technically, I have a way to do this
6338430	6340331	I have extension cords and very small TVs.
6340551	6342392	I guess I really shouldn't challenge you, should I?
6343273	6343673	All right.
6344193	6345034	I'll think of a way.
6346174	6349256	Remember, 90% of what I have done, motivated by spite.
6349456	6350156	Yes, and porn.
6353818	6358561	Anyhow, that was one of, obviously, the best Super Nintendo games and best games in the Castlevania series.
6359341	6362663	Not my absolute favorite in the Castlevania series, but for some people it is their favorite.
6363164	6364624	And I will say this, killer soundtrack.
6365165	6365665	Some of the best.
6366025	6366425	Oh, yeah.
6366605	6370807	But, you know, in my esteem, nothing beats Dracula X. Symphony of the Night.
6371227	6372708	I know it's cliche, but damn it.
6373388	6374208	So freaking good.
6374749	6383152	I would say of the traditional Castlevania games, Dracula X. Dracula X is more like a bridge between those styles.
6383252	6389275	I still have a soft spot for Simon's Quest, which I think is the earliest kind of Metroidvania style game.
6389295	6390635	What a terrible night for a curse.
6390695	6390996	Anyway.
6392396	6393698	But we're digressing again.
6394378	6404628	How about some rumors about other Mario Universe characters that could possibly be playable in Super Mario 3D World?
6404989	6410414	There's some speculation out there because of stamp collecting that occurs in Super Mario 3D World.
6410754	6416060	There's some icons that have been spotted where, hmm, this kind of looks like Rosalina.
6416420	6417060	Super Mario 3D World
6440674	6451182	is going to already have Luigi, Mario, Princess, and Toad in the style of their appearance in Super Mario 2, where Princess floats, Luigi does flappy legs, and all that stuff.
6451242	6452843	You mean Doki Doki Panic, the ROM hack?
6452923	6453944	Well, same thing.
6454764	6456406	It was a little more than a ROM hack, though.
6456546	6460649	I know, I stole that from Game Sack, but it was probably the best name for it I've ever heard.
6461823	6462644	DarkSakura, what do you have for us?
6462664	6464326	I have stuff I have a site that won't load so I'm skipping it
6480340	6484682	and this is the very important news that everyone's been waiting for.
6485102	6488604	How to avoid Pokemon X and Y's game breaking bug.
6489744	6492225	First of all, you can download the patch, which is out.
6493646	6500549	The patch is out there on the 3DS eShop and you just go there, update, blah, blah, blah, you're done.
6500669	6504211	However, other ways around...
6504691	6505552	Did we finally breed?
6505652	6507674	I'm literally opening up the eShop right now.
6507694	6508695	I was like, oh shit, she's got a point.
6508715	6514059	I thought you were checking to see if our machines... No, our DSs do not want to mate today for some reason.
6514279	6515721	Here, I'll move you over there.
6516321	6516902	Very rude.
6517222	6518723	I even had mine hump yours, okay?
6519364	6519484	No.
6520925	6521566	Oh my!
6523328	6523748	Scandal.
6523988	6538224	Anyway, so the other way that you could do that is that, like I said, Nintendo had put out a map that showed where the bug could occur, and so it gave you areas that you could save your game in and avoid the bug.
6538724	6545932	But now with the fix that's come out, it also should correct any broken game saves.
6546453	6555522	So wherever you saved, if you happen to have experienced this bug, if you haven't deleted your save file, then you should be fine.
6555563	6556283	It will be restored.
6556303	6558025	Just go to your eShop and download it.
6559286	6586769	in other news oh god I was just talking about Rival Schools a moment ago too there is some talk from Hideaki Itsuno who wants to create a Rival Schools 3 and Rival Schools is probably like my all time favorite number one fighting game series ever in the world universe I love it I mean I even like it better than all the Tekkens combined and I really like me some Tekken
6587609	6592954	So, um, he was the past director of the Rival School series, and he did, um, recently did Dragon's Dogma.
6593715	6602183	And, um, he basically, you know, what was, uh, said about it is that it was, it captured authentic fighting.
6602963	6607968	Um, as you say, basically, uh, Street Fighter II was his, um, inspiration.
6608468	6612472	So during an interview, he said, and this is with the Anime News Network, um...
6613553	6617975	He said that he would really like to make a new Rival Schools title.
6618375	6619735	Which, honestly, do it.
6621456	6622396	No hesitation, do it.
6622536	6624237	Bring back all the characters, put in some more.
6625697	6628358	We haven't had all the sports done.
6628398	6630679	We could have more hooligans.
6630759	6631339	We could have more.
6631900	6636021	I was talking about this before the show with Rob, and I was saying that I really, really miss Rival Schools Disc 2.
6636861	6638762	All of those minigames were incredibly fun.
6639554	6643436	Or, you know, you've had Sakura in the game now for two versions of it.
6643516	6645116	I mean, she's a hidden character in the first one.
6645656	6649278	And officially in... Well, you know, I have the Evolution disc.
6650358	6653059	That had, like, the dancing game and the dating sim and all that in it.
6653820	6656000	I paid a hundred bucks for that sucker when I had money.
6656881	6658361	And it's freaking awesome.
6658461	6660522	I'll have to show you some stuff on it.
6660562	6663323	But, like, I got, like, Batsu asked my character out.
6663383	6664524	It was all cool and cute.
6665724	6667105	But there were...
6669736	6678359	That's the game that introduced the Taicho, the class president, and the photographer, and dude who swims.
6679419	6680359	Why can't I remember his name?
6680979	6686701	But that's the game that introduced a lot of those characters that were in Rival Schools 2, and then Rival Schools 2 brought out my favorite of all time, Zaki.
6688522	6689342	But I mean, just think about it.
6689542	6690162	It's about time.
6692043	6692363	Why not?
6692643	6692843	Yeah.
6693163	6695824	And I'm actually, now I'm done filling time for the story that wouldn't load.
6698537	6710303	I can finish one off on that note my conventional popular still going fighting games I love but either Rival Schools or Bloody Roar are probably my two favorites from that era
6711158	6712919	Bloody Roar was an interesting game.
6713800	6717041	Didn't they actually remake that in like the last couple years?
6717201	6717662	No.
6717682	6718782	I don't recall.
6719063	6719643	I'm just crazy.
6719863	6722104	You may be thinking of Beast Riser.
6722184	6724786	I don't know why they call it Beast Riser.
6724826	6727107	That's just such a dumb name for it.
6728848	6730229	I think that was the Japanese name for it.
6730509	6732490	Because it had an arcade version of it.
6732510	6734551	That's a rip off of Bloody Roar.
6735812	6738113	At least it wasn't Brutal Paws of Fury.
6739974	6740855	Because that was kind of crap.
6741937	6747283	Alright, before we get to the Fugo question of the week We skipped a story Yeah, I was like, did you need me to do that?
6747303	6748565	Because it wouldn't load on her iPad, right?
6748725	6758936	Yeah, it wouldn't load at all Which, basically anything that I ever get from that site won't load Tsk, tsk, well, here we go This is important because it was in the intro, so we have to cover it
6760578	6761538	Sorry, sorry.
6761718	6762178	No, it's fine.
6762238	6762959	It has been found.
6763039	6765819	The ToeJam & Earl 3, Mission to Earth.
6766340	6766900	That's right.
6767540	6775902	Sega apparently made that for the Xbox, of course, but did you know that there was another ToeJam & Earl 3 at one point that was being made for the Dreamcast?
6776642	6783124	Some footage is now online, and apparently the owner of the disc wants to have a fundraiser to get the code online.
6783844	6785485	ToeJam & Earl 3 Back from the Dead ToeJam & Earl 3
6813407	6814268	Star Gladiator was awesome.
6841730	6843673	All right, now we can do the Fugle Question of the Week, yes?
6844093	6844714	I guess.
6845075	6845635	I guess.
6845776	6848780	All right, DarkSakura is going to permiss it at some point here.
6848800	6849220	So here we go.
6849260	6853446	You take Facebook, you take Google+, slam those words to give permission.
6853687	6854027	Permit.
6854568	6854868	Whatever.
6863707	6867530	Facebook and Google Plus slam them together and you get Fugle Plus.
6867950	6868810	Or we just call it Fugle.
6869411	6871312	Let's read some of the answers here.
6871432	6874534	And we had a lot of answers, you guys, over on Facebook and Google Plus.
6874754	6875535	I can't read them all.
6875575	6876455	There is not enough time.
6876876	6878056	I'm going to read some of these, though.
6878497	6884981	And the question we asked this week, what is the scariest moment you've ever experienced in a video game?
6885041	6886362	I mean, Halloween's next week, right?
6886402	6888183	So why not ask a question about scary games?
6889044	6889424	In spirit.
6889944	6891985	How about when I thought Aerith was going to come back to life?
6892886	6893827	That's a good answer.
6893867	6894227	There you go.
6894247	6895528	All right.
6895988	6906475	Or mine would be probably when I was playing Silent Hill 4 The Room and I literally screamed out loud and one of those baby face monsters came running at me and Loki was like, what the hell are you doing?
6906555	6909397	You know the only thing that creeped me out in that game was the giant head.
6909877	6910738	Oh, yeah.
6910758	6911719	Just watch you.
6911739	6911819	Sure.
6912219	6913740	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
6942138	6943559	Let's see, going to some other answers.
6943940	6951165	Dead Rising says, after gathering like 30,000 PP and then trying to run to a save point while killing zombies on my last health bar.
6951265	6951746	Scary.
6952366	6958851	I think that was Mike saying the game Dead Rising because the 30,000 percentage points.
6958911	6964835	See, when somebody writes their name like that, I'm like, is that what you want us to call you?
6965195	6967637	He's definitely talking about Dead Rising the game.
6967697	6969459	I can say that with 100% certainty.
6969479	6969919	There you go.
6969939	6970780	It does involve zombies.
6972340	6973680	Let's see, some more answers here.
6973740	6978041	Scott W. says, it always comes back to the dog crashing through the window in Resident Evil.
6978061	6979042	Shit gets me every time.
6979362	6980302	Oh my god, I remember that.
6980822	6981622	It was so scary.
6982122	6985363	Strudels89 says, playing The Last of Us in the Dark with my husband.
6985663	6990664	Walking around a corner thinking we're safe, then having two clickers jump out and rip Joel's throat out.
6991024	6993085	I screamed so loud and threw my controller on the bed.
6994305	6997987	CatFury05 says the first time I saw Pyramid Head in Silent Hill 2.
6998648	7000009	Still scares me to this day.
7000549	7001370	That was pretty creepy.
7003291	7005072	Mary B says Fatal Frame.
7005512	7008554	We were in our apartment in the dark having played for a couple hours.
7008934	7011436	As Pat said, they never attack on the stairs.
7011516	7016419	He was promptly attacked from above by one of those ghastly creatures and I let out a blood-curdling scream.
7016799	7020301	Game controller was thrown, lights turned on, and we were done for the night.
7020821	7023003	That and all of Fatal Frame's freaking
7023783	7025885	Celerity Ghosts Is that Mary Moo?
7026286	7046726	Yes it is That is your friend Mary Let's see, Curdy K responds and says, still being a kid and playing Friday the 13th on the NES That game was so bad That game was underrated It was good It was good for what it was There were better games, yes The Friday the 13th game was worse
7047632	7049693	I mean that Nightmare on Elm Street game.
7050553	7051774	The blah blah.
7051854	7052174	Let's see.
7052294	7058796	Eric D. says Resident Evil 2 when you get to the jail cells in the basement and the dogs break out and start chasing you down some dark hallways.
7059136	7060397	Man, that scared the crap out of me.
7060457	7062197	So there's another one for dogs in Resident Evil.
7063458	7063818	Let's see.
7063898	7069640	Justin M. says the opening of Half-Life 2 was pretty unnerving as was the in-browser boogeyman movie tie-in game.
7070000	7072361	Scared the bejesus out of me freshman year of college.
7076423	7083546	I don't play a lot of scary games really, but the first one that ever creeped me out was the first adventure game that I ever played, Sanitarium.
7084087	7088989	There was a level where you were exploring an abandoned mental hospital with remnants of bodies laying around.
7089309	7096313	The combination of this gross, empty hospital, the creepy music, and the main character's inner monologue definitely left me creeped out.
7096813	7104336	So those are only some of the answers, and I'm sorry I didn't read them all, but those are some of the answers from our Facebook page over at facebook.com slash orange launch radio.
7104376	7109098	Please go read the rest, because there's some great answers involving like Oculus Rift and some other stuff too, so check it out.
7109858	7111899	Going to Google Plus and reading some answers there.
7112579	7116120	The birthday boy, Actdeft, says, playing a version on PC.
7116720	7121082	It starts out sweet and nice, and then the game starts messing with you in really freaked out ways.
7121502	7123443	I played and finished the game in one sitting.
7123703	7152065	but I was alone in my house and it was getting dark too so I really got scared as I progressed through it and lastly Colin M says the PC version of Slender freaked me out sometime between finding the 5th and 6th pages my flashlight had burned out and I was basically running around in the dark before the Slenderman caught me yeah Slenderman super scary game I don't know until you've played it so many times you kind of start to figure out the patterns and it's numbed a little bit but still a really good experience
7152293	7153954	Akuma JP just made my heart leap.
7154514	7155955	There was a Ju-on game for Wii.
7156395	7156975	Was there really?
7156995	7159456	And I need this in my life.
7159856	7160657	Oh yeah, I remember that.
7161097	7161797	It was terrible.
7162338	7163058	You said it was good.
7163078	7164419	Didn't you say that?
7164439	7166139	No, I remember that came out a few years ago.
7166159	7167040	No, you just said it was scary.
7167300	7170061	And I remember telling everybody about that multiple times, especially you.
7170081	7172922	Yeah, well I don't remember that because I don't pay attention to the Wii.
7173062	7173543	It's been a while.
7173563	7175303	I need this in my life and I don't care how bad it is.
7176784	7179345	I played the Project Runway game on Wii, which was pretty bad.
7179385	7180626	But it's just a thing.
7180646	7181266	You have to try it.
7181346	7184027	I remember a scary moment when I thought my save file got corrupted.
7186008	7188189	I remember another scary moment in games.
7188269	7189029	Actually, I thought of one.
7189069	7192751	What was the Silent Hill on 360 called, the first one?
7192811	7193331	Silent Hill...
7194557	7194997	Homecoming?
7195517	7196118	Yes, Homecoming.
7196258	7196938	Homecoming was good.
7196958	7198978	With that kid.
7199579	7203760	And I was home by myself in the dark, and it was raining outside.
7204600	7210702	And you know how when you're in the hospital in the very beginning, a body falls just from the air duct or something?
7210722	7211762	It just falls down in front of you?
7211782	7213483	You go, let the bodies hit the...
7215043	7217304	Well, I screamed and jumped out of my chair.
7217724	7220946	And because it was storming outside, the front door blew open.
7222506	7226708	And I promptly, like you can even see, step one, ran, slammed the door.
7226788	7229610	Step two, closed off the Xbox without even saving.
7229650	7232111	Step three, ran into the bedroom and got under the covers and cried.
7232811	7245778	I didn't really cry, but... Lisa said it was the Xbox, because if it was, you know, the Wii or the GameCube or something, there is a potential that Rosetti may have come back and, you know, given you a nice long lecture afterwards, which is equally scary.
7246038	7249440	Now, there is a game that I mentioned in chat that I haven't heard anyone say anything about.
7249660	7250020	What's that?
7250160	7250980	Phantasmagoria.
7251341	7255243	Oh, yeah, the old PC... Which I have covered as a classic game.
7255263	7258124	Wasn't that Roberta Williams' last game or, like, one of her last games?
7258144	7259005	I think so.
7259065	7261426	Yeah, before she... But, I mean, that game was pretty...
7262606	7264127	It was way ahead of its time.
7264167	7265308	It was way ahead of its time.
7265969	7268770	And it was literally on seven or eight CDs.
7269351	7269851	It was seven.
7270311	7271472	It was all that.
7272052	7273133	That was during that phase.
7273173	7274974	We had a really quick phase in gaming.
7274994	7276135	It was right around the same time as the Sega CD.
7276155	7276755	The full motion.
7277116	7278616	Yeah, the full motion acting.
7279137	7280898	Dan and I were actually just talking about that earlier today.
7281178	7282120	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7294844	7298746	I remember on the PC you had Phantasmagoria, Seventh Guest was a huge one.
7298786	7299667	And you're seeing that.
7299707	7300748	They just re-released that on Steam.
7300768	7301968	And what was the sequel, Eleventh Hour?
7302108	7302789	Eleventh Hour.
7303949	7307311	And then, of course, SimCity with SimCity Action News.
7308072	7310833	Wing Commander, The X-Files was on like eight or nine days.
7310853	7312514	Wasn't Wing Commander 3 that one?
7312895	7313895	I only remember four.
7314095	7315716	Wing Commander 3 was the one with Mark Hamill in it.
7315736	7316317	Yeah, I think so.
7317157	7317597	I believe so.
7317898	7318398	Gabriel Knight.
7320049	7321290	Gabriel Knight.
7322390	7323571	Didn't Gabriel Knight have Tim Curry?
7323671	7324571	I think it was just Acted.
7324631	7325451	Maybe it was in the sequel.
7326051	7333094	But I mean, there were tons of different horror games out that I'm sure scared people.
7333794	7336895	But going back to the day, even old text games.
7337315	7339436	I mean, being eaten by a group is pretty scary.
7339456	7340236	It is pretty scary.
7341756	7345838	Alright, let's do a few more stories in the mailbag and phone calls and all that.
7345898	7346398	So, Loki.
7347697	7353341	Alright, so the Ouya, they changed a few things.
7353641	7356443	One, they're redesigning the controller for the Ouya 2.
7356803	7358604	Yes, the Ouya 2 will be out next year.
7358664	7360205	At least that's what's planned right now.
7361226	7363828	And they're going back and redesigning the controller.
7363908	7366209	Actually, I think they've already redesigned the controller now.
7366590	7371833	And I'm kind of confused about it because I know that they redesigned the controller from when they kickstarted to when they released.
7372774	7374935	But now they're talking about redesigning it again.
7375796	7377237	And one of the questions was,
7378058	7386368	So, how am I going to know if I buy an Ouya if it's going to be the one that has a redesigned controller that's supposed to be better or the older one that the controller is not so good?
7387068	7392315	And Julie Erman said, uh, you don't know.
7393536	7422926	so that's a great answer there's no way to distinguish that and of course they're right now planning on shipping the Ouya 2 I guess sometime in 2014 and they haven't finalized a date on it yet but they're kind of investigating right now what kind of graphics chip they want to put inside there to be able to support the older games as well as push a little bit better performance out of newer games and titles
7423263	7432771	I understand them bringing out another console so that they can find their happy medium and find what's going to work and be relatively future-proof, but two consoles in two years?
7434152	7436674	I don't... Oops, here's the apology.
7437475	7442539	If they make that a trend, it just seems really stupid for something that's supposed to be an internet console.
7442679	7443740	Aren't you an iPhone user?
7444701	7451166	I... I'm just saying... Point, point, but I am still using my 4S.
7453144	7458588	And keep in mind, they're all quality products as opposed to the OUYA.
7458888	7460970	Yeah, you don't have to buy every revision.
7460990	7464352	They bring it forward because they have new things.
7464713	7470777	I'm still rocking my iPad third generation, aka the one that Apple would rather you just forget about.
7471098	7471698	You know what this is?
7472358	7473980	The only other iPad they still sell.
7474180	7475621	The iPad 2, right?
7475661	7475901	Yes.
7476742	7477643	And all I have to say...
7478283	7479685	To hell with the iPad Air.
7480085	7481967	I'm still going to rock that iPad third generation.
7482147	7482367	Do it.
7482688	7483128	That's right.
7483529	7485551	My retina display and my old school charger.
7485611	7486231	That's all I need.
7486291	7486532	Do it.
7488581	7489502	Loki's like, can I finish?
7489702	7492823	We're also talking about a $600 difference, but continue, please.
7492963	7493864	Well, here's the thing, too.
7494084	7500466	The problem, though, with coming out with an OUYA 2.0 or whatever is you're not coming out now first anymore.
7500526	7507569	Now you're coming out in potentially a field where there are going to be multiple consoles out there that do the same type of thing.
7507749	7510210	Whose features will blow yours away.
7510290	7510910	Exactly.
7510970	7515092	Who can do your thing better and for probably cheaper and...
7515672	7518954	One of the things, you know, she's basically said, oh, hey, you know what?
7518994	7520736	We're open to cloud gaming.
7520796	7524178	And, hey, we're even open to our storefront being on third-party hardware.
7524558	7525899	We'll do anything.
7526179	7527040	We'll blow anyone.
7527060	7530002	Why the fuck would I want to buy into you?
7530042	7532583	We're open to putting a flashlight in the side of the console.
7533564	7537787	And besides that, if they really wanted to be clever, they are passing up a fantastic marketing idea.
7538487	7538948	The Tuya.
7539608	7550291	I'm just saying, I'm just saying, if they put a flashlight in the side of that console, it's going to have to be for really small dick people because that is a really small console.
7550931	7552732	No, the flashlight will be bigger than the console.
7555313	7561215	So what you're saying is it'll look like a giant cylinder, aka the new Mac that they have out there.
7561255	7562755	It looks like a fucking trash can.
7563593	7571162	It's fucking expensive.
7571482	7573605	It does slightly better things than the last one.
7573805	7583777	You'll release yet another computer in a year or two that will look stupid and will do something slightly better than the other one will be fucking expensive and everyone will go
7584497	7597660	The other problem with the Ouya is that because they didn't discontinue the Wii in North America, you can get a dirt fucking cheap console here that plays a heck of a lot more games than what's really available on Ouya.
7597920	7603482	I gotta be honest, if you're out there in the market and you're like, hell, I need a system to...
7604242	7606463	Thank you for watching!
7626028	7629669	and stuff that's in the Google Play Marketplace that's free.
7630269	7636590	So why would you spend money on this stuff that has a locked out marketplace?
7637650	7638850	Put it this way.
7638910	7640091	I had the console for a while.
7640511	7641991	There are some okay games on there.
7642191	7644711	They're promising there's going to be more games on there that'll be good.
7644971	7645451	But you know what?
7645491	7648892	All those people, they're fucking not just making their games exclusive to the Wii.
7648952	7651413	It's coming out on PC and Android and all that stuff.
7651993	7653833	So you might as well just
7655353	7656014	We could use a new mic.
7671048	7674789	or buy a used OUYA, I mean, if you really want to.
7674930	7675350	I don't know.
7675450	7676950	I just don't see there's not a lot.
7677691	7686974	There's no real reason why you want to get an OUYA because they were saying before, oh, you're going to be able to run XBMC on it and stuff.
7688495	7691556	Well, except it doesn't run it very well, so why would you do that?
7692156	7697158	You can get really cheap tablets nowadays, and a lot of them already have HDMI out.
7698760	7700141	So, I don't know.
7700702	7707828	Especially with the Google thing that they have now where you can plug it into your TV and more support for apps for that.
7708068	7708689	Chromecast.
7708769	7709549	Yeah, Chromecast.
7710290	7714934	You don't really need a microconsole because a lot of other shit is doing this stuff already.
7715753	7724681	Dan and I were talking this morning about taking, because we're probably going to eventually gut our front room computer and put it in a new frame.
7724721	7728705	And I was like, well, you know people who build the Nintendo computers with the small bits?
7729165	7731587	I've wanted to do one out of a 1950s radio.
7732988	7738193	But I mean, you can build these things for yourself at home and they'll run whatever you need them to run within reason.
7738973	7742977	You know, coming by parts is just a matter of smart shopping.
7743374	7750557	Especially if you're going to make a system, if all you're interested in is emulators, you don't need that powerful of a system to run emulators.
7750857	7752018	I mean, seriously.
7752518	7753478	Get a Dreamcast.
7753699	7755659	Just buy a fucking old-ass PC.
7755759	7756940	You can probably do that.
7757040	7760241	Yeah, Dreamcast, but Dreamcast even, that doesn't run everything very smoothly.
7760261	7763583	It'll run Nintendo and... You still have to go through some hoops for that, but...
7763843	7764984	Just get an old PC.
7766505	7770987	The front room computer that we have was pretty much given to us when someone was done with it.
7771007	7772648	I think it was Dan's mom or somebody.
7774149	7778452	All we use it for is emulator games when we don't feel like busting out the Super Nintendo.
7779352	7779513	And...
7781687	7783169	Watching Netflix and Hulu.
7784110	7784370	That's it.
7784410	7793239	Also, if you're interested in buying a Ouya and, God forbid, they kickstart something else again, just remember how wonderful the Kickstarter went the first time around.
7793639	7795000	Ask up front who's shipping.
7795201	7802067	As in, as in right now, some people that backed that Kickstarter still don't have their fucking console yet.
7802788	7803329	Just saying.
7803409	7804370	And for the record...
7805572	7807877	at Radio Shack where my husband manages.
7808479	7814252	I saw laptops there that were fully equipped to do everything that we can do for 250 bucks.
7816821	7820303	You can get a laptop instead of getting that piece of garbage.
7820323	7820823	It's still not 99.
7820963	7821524	It's still not 99.
7821824	7822104	All right.
7822184	7823905	Yeah, but you get a lot more value.
7823925	7825326	I was going to say that the next one's going to be $99.
7825366	7826366	That's the other thing, too.
7826386	7827407	All right.
7827447	7827847	Moving on.
7827887	7828347	Moving on, guys.
7830188	7838413	It's another week, so there must be another story coming out of EA somewhere that's hating on the Wii U. And here we go.
7838753	7842555	Creative Director Craig Sullivan from Ghost Games.
7842595	7844316	So technically it's not EA, but you know.
7845377	7869156	So Craig Sullivan with Ghost Games is making Need for Speed Rivals and in an interview with the Six Axis talks about why it's not coming to the Wii U Rivals is going on new hardware and you have to work out where you focus your efforts The 200 people working on this game are only capable of so much and doing so many different versions of the game so we had to go with where we think the biggest audience will be for the game and that's where we are
7870556	7893343	As you may or may not know, Need for Speed Rivals is running on the Frostbite 3 engine Earlier this year we had news that they're not going to bother with putting Frostbite 3 engine on the Wii U Back when EA kind of first was talking about how they're distancing themselves from the Wii U Because the Wii U can't handle it or whatever Which means it's not going to get Dragon Age or Mass Effect It's not going to get any of that because those are all going to be on the Frostbite 3 engine as well
7894783	7895404	So there you go.
7896784	7900286	Need for Speed Rivals not coming on the Wii U anytime soon.
7900586	7905608	And, you know, stories like this are never really a great sign for that system.
7905688	7911851	But, you know, Nintendo's going to keep pumping out their games that will carry that system well enough.
7912371	7918614	And I also kind of think, I got to be really honest here when it kind of comes to the whole journalism element of this story.
7919472	7948545	I kind of think in this interview you were baiting this guy to hate on the Wii U because I think when you look at a game like Need for Speed Rivals or a lot of the stuff that goes to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One you know the Wii U can't handle that stuff like you know the Wii U is based a little more off the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 granted what's in there is a little more powerful but we all kind of know that what's inside a Wii U is not the same thing that's inside these other systems
7949887	7971939	so weren't we kind of baiting this guy a little bit isn't the answer obvious why this game is not on wii u well it's it it's like you said that they're making it for multiple consoles and so you know they only have enough okay we can only put it on x number of different consoles and so we're going to pick the ones that have you know what we think are going to be the largest market share i mean that just makes sense but yes they are masturbators
7973127	7982640	Dark Tetsuya in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, This story frustrates me because I love Need for Speed and I want a Wii U and that customization stuff would be perfect for the touchpad.
7983321	7987366	Yeah, it's kind of a bummer more people don't think to do it, but...
7988365	7996489	If only the Xbox 360 had a second screen app or something that you could use the touchpad to do customization.
7996910	7998270	If only they had that.
7998370	8009936	Didn't you listen to Bobby's show earlier tonight when our good pal Bobby Blackwolf, who always tapes before us here at VOG Network, he was talking about he went to the Xbox One preview event in Atlanta and was asking questions about...
8011477	8012679	Now I don't even remember the name of it.
8012699	8013300	Smart Glass!
8014161	8015162	I just think Smartass.
8015402	8017205	Like Smartass, like Loki, but it's Smart Glass.
8017225	8019207	You mean that app I downloaded that I've never used?
8019287	8020329	They didn't even know what it was.
8023001	8023161	Girl
8045742	8050650	It's funny because there's a lot of opportunity in theory with the surface for stuff like that.
8050770	8051571	Right.
8052613	8053074	Well, anyway.
8054378	8060983	It's like you've got all this second screen technology like slapping you in the face and still nobody wants to jump on boards.
8061363	8062984	Except Nintendo, sorta.
8064105	8070610	Although certainly there's those wank rumors that they're thinking about releasing a new Wii that doesn't have the touchpad so they can rule the bug.
8070630	8071790	Yeah, that's what I meant.
8071810	8072971	The Wii U without the touchpad.
8072991	8073652	But I don't know.
8074652	8075993	Again, wank, wank, wank, wank, wank.
8077134	8079035	I don't know how much stock I put in there.
8079055	8079515	Why?
8079655	8083617	At that point, it's like, you're taking the gimmick out, so now there's no reason.
8086078	8088439	Yeah, because that worked so well with the Wii Mini.
8088459	8091880	They took out all the extra features that you didn't really need, like internet.
8092401	8094962	Go back and focus on what made the Wii so popular.
8095182	8097403	All the flailing with the controller.
8097603	8097963	Why not?
8098343	8099524	Wii Sports HD, buddy.
8099864	8100284	It's coming.
8103439	8109047	Anyhow, let's see what the listeners think in a segment we call the Mailbag.
8109207	8110749	Every week, you guys send us emails.
8110789	8112792	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
8113152	8119421	And DarkSakura will dive into the Mailbag headfirst and find some emails that she deems worthy.
8119901	8121082	of being read here on the show.
8121142	8129327	I know we... Do I gotta... We spoiled this a little bit earlier in the show with one email, but there's still plenty more unlicked, unspoiled emails to go.
8129347	8129667	We got a bunch.
8129687	8130668	We did get a lot tonight, didn't we?
8130708	8133209	We got a couple more, actually, after checking the mail.
8133229	8134430	Oh, you don't have to read them all, you know.
8134450	8135911	Well, I'm gonna, because Gemma emailed.
8136551	8136831	Alright.
8137191	8138092	Well, you can skip his.
8138272	8138452	Shit.
8138472	8138953	You know what?
8140990	8143151	Hi, Jamie, Loki, and I guess Rob.
8143171	8143911	You see what I mean?
8144131	8144472	Yeah.
8145332	8152495	I heard Rob talking about Pokemon not really utilizing the 3D, and I was curious if you guys think it's even worth it to buy the 3DS or just go with the 2DS.
8153095	8156837	I'm still trying to decide between the two, and I would love to hear what you all think.
8157217	8160278	Thanks for making my unbearable weekend commutes less horrible gimmick.
8160559	8162259	Do you wear pants with large pockets?
8164440	8164700	No?
8165201	8165541	3DS.
8165581	8166041	Yes?
8166801	8167141	2DS.
8167522	8168302	If you have a man bag.
8168991	8169431	That's true.
8170311	8172052	Gemet probably does accessorize with a man purse.
8172072	8175373	They do have cases for the 2DS.
8175553	8182714	In all honesty, I still think the 3DS XL is the best system because the screens are still larger on an XL.
8183315	8188656	And I might also be a little biased because I really want that freaking Zelda 3DS XL that's coming out.
8190037	8192720	So I still think the XL is the best one of any of them.
8193080	8196784	But the 2DS is not a bad alternative, and it is a much lower price.
8197165	8203031	So you kind of have to just ask yourself, how much is A, a bigger screen, and B, 3D worth?
8203392	8205734	Because otherwise, functionally, they're really the same system.
8206855	8210679	But, you know, if all you want to do is play Pokemon...
8211670	8234437	Then shit, get the 2DS, it doesn't really matter But if you're thinking about the future You know, the 3D does really come in handy in some games Like Super Mario 3D Land you were talking about 3D is really useful in that game I use it actually on occasion in Animal Crossing Even though I can't keep the 3D on for very long But I use it to catch flying bugs Just because sometimes it's really hard to tell Where they are in relation to where you are Without the 3D Um
8238092	8250060	It also depends, I mean, even though I don't use the 3D, if I had a choice between the two, if someone was like, here, pick one, I'd still probably stick with the 3DS because I also like having it collapse.
8250540	8252161	I like having it close.
8252522	8263569	And that's always been something that I like because I actually adjust my screen level depending on if I'm sitting down and playing, if I happen to be in the car, which I don't really play that much in the car, but
8264509	8267870	You really do have to question some of the design choices around the 2DS.
8267910	8269791	I mean, it feels... It's intended for kids.
8270111	8271692	When it's in your hands, it feels nice.
8271732	8274293	But yeah, just the whole fact it doesn't close is... I don't know.
8274633	8275774	But I get the hinges break.
8275814	8276834	Fewer moving parts.
8277194	8277654	Yeah.
8278175	8281756	Well, on top of that, you have wires running in the hinges too.
8281776	8283036	It's just like with a regular laptop.
8283056	8283477	Sure, sure.
8283577	8291620	So you have a lot more room to make it completely unplayable as opposed to, you know, one full put together hard plastic piece.
8292296	8321464	so honestly Gemma you kind of just have to ask yourself like what how much is it worth like am I willing to pay that extra money to have the larger screens and have it close up and if that's really not a big deal to you and there's really only the one game you want to play on it then fuck it get a 2DS why not by the way Gemma says it's a messenger bag wait for a bundle with a design that you really really like and then buy that whatever it is 2D or 3D there is a Pokemon 3DS XL for what it's worth red and blue one or have wonderful wonderful friends like Slidekick
8322270	8322710	There you go.
8323431	8324152	Thank you so much.
8324172	8325553	That's the only reason I have a 3DS.
8326394	8327575	Thank you for feeding my addiction.
8327615	8327975	I love you.
8328135	8328856	What a nice boy.
8329136	8329396	Yes.
8329916	8331198	You get cookies.
8331918	8332539	Hey, Olar.
8332599	8336202	Before I go into the meat of my email, I thought I'd update my situation with Gamerscape.
8336242	8337203	This is Rostel UT.
8338264	8350334	I tried to file a complaint against them with the BBB, but they didn't seem to have a site listed in their business, and I couldn't find the address or the like, which seems to be required when submitting a complaint about a business the BBB is unaware of.
8350934	8353275	All I could get is that they're in Stockholm, Sweden.
8353655	8356656	And I'm not going to burn a chargeback over $10.
8356736	8358837	I'm not sure what, if anything, I can do about this.
8359257	8364098	I'm probably just out of luck and left telling anyone who will listen to avoid that pisshole of a site.
8366079	8368880	Views and opinions expressed by the emailer.
8368940	8370140	I don't know this site at all.
8370180	8374921	But there are businesses that do keep foreign addresses to precisely not have to answer.
8377522	8382103	Good on him for following up and putting his angry pen where his mouth is, so to speak.
8382143	8389445	What was the thing that I used to quote from some study that I did in customer service, actually?
8390005	8394866	That out of every eight people with a complaint, only one will be an advocate.
8396207	8397828	That means only one person will do something about it.
8397988	8400109	So thank you for being an advocate.
8401330	8404192	Anyway, enough of those cancers on gaming.
8404292	8404512	Wow.
8405253	8408135	Rob asked me if I consider Desura my happy alternative.
8408595	8413639	Unlike many, I don't have a real preference when it comes to services other than they offer DRM-free games.
8414059	8420906	Dessert is DRM agnostic, meaning they'll put games that publishers are absolutely adamant about DRM.
8421286	8426291	However, they do make sure to let you know that if you're getting a game that needs DRM, so I know what to avoid.
8426431	8428813	I just wish I could filter out DRM titles in search.
8430395	8434540	Other sites I use are Indie Game Stand, GOG, and Humble Bundle.
8435261	8443471	Also, I've just recently discovered that if a site is selling their game with the Humble widget, it can be linked to your Humble Bundle account, which greatly expands my options.
8443591	8445253	I found a place called Bundle in a Box.
8445894	8467203	and I haven't known of them long enough to see a bundle I want from them but I'll get back to you on that I've also looked at .emu which seems to be a GOG like service so I'll be giving them a try when I can basically I'll go wherever to get my PC games DRM free so that's my answer to Rob's question anyway I hope you guys don't mind my whining I like that he had an answer to the question so thank you
8467672	8480781	To go back to the whole GamersGate thing, if you do a Whois search on them, just type Whois in Google, type in their URL when it pops up on the GoDaddy site, it'll give you their address right there.
8481922	8488166	But as he said, Stockholm, Sweden, the actual company's name is apparently Paradox Interactive AB.
8488967	8492429	There's also Lupia AB and various other things.
8492869	8494831	But yeah, definitely registered overseas.
8495591	8496732	Somewhat out of BBB reach.
8498342	8503344	Also, P.S., when are you going to include the forums in your Fugle Question of the Week?
8503524	8505085	I, for one, don't like social media networks.
8506506	8516971	That's a fair question, but honestly our forums have not been very active at vognetwork.com and I just kind of think, I don't know, I wonder if maybe forums in general just aren't really a thing these days.
8517091	8519633	What in general would get people to participate more in the forums?
8519653	8520553	Change it to a BBS.
8521234	8521514	Like a...
8522114	8550039	Like a, you know, or do it Reddit style I am all for setting up a VOG Network BBS Where we could play games like Legend of the Red Dragon Actually, I would so be down for that That would be awesome But that has nothing to do with a freaking PHP BB So I don't know I mean, I guess, you know, the obvious answer is Well, Rob, try posting that on the forums and see what happens Or I'm also going to be honest Most of the questions I think of the day of the show And a large part of that is that we don't always know all the news Until the day of the show
8551120	8553702	So you wouldn't have a lot of time, and that's one concern I have.
8554042	8559907	And Facebook and Google, whether you love them or hate them, are always very immediate.
8560547	8564831	People check their news feed all the time and so forth, so that's what makes it attractive.
8565316	8578183	However, as a suggestion, and I myself am doing something similar, if you happen to see something from a Fugle question of the week and you feel would make a good personal editorial, why not try to submit some content?
8578503	8579763	Oh, yeah.
8579803	8583425	Send us an article if you have something to say about something that's been a Fugle question.
8584026	8591569	And, you know, assuming it's not full of accusing too many people or companies of being cancers on gaming, we might publish it.
8591649	8591810	Yeah.
8593130	8598691	We do want a little bit more diplomacy in things on our site.
8598771	8600131	And BlackWolf does have a good point.
8600171	8601732	You get more than enough answers anyway.
8601972	8603972	Tonight, we just had too many answers to read.
8604052	8614975	I'd still be reading them right now, which, don't get me wrong, love you guys for participating, but part of it is, too, that I want everybody to be able to go read all the answers themselves and just hear me rattle them off.
8615755	8617035	And three-hour show.
8617695	8619256	A three-hour show with news and not.
8641650	8642491	DarkSakura, Loki,
8657509	8665156	It's a new MMO space sim coming out from Chris Roberts and as of this email, it has raised over $24 million through pure crowdfunding.
8665697	8668379	The game looks like it's going to be amazing and has a ton of backers.
8668719	8673244	Chris Roberts is looking to make a PC game to push the PC to its limit.
8674104	8681131	Check it out at RobertsSpaceIndustries.com So that's RobertsSpaceIndustries.com
8682652	8686755	Anyway, thanks for the podcast and I hope to be able to join the live stream at some point soon.
8686955	8687395	Duran.
8687876	8689096	Oh, I saw that name in chat tonight.
8689497	8690057	Hi, Duran.
8690097	8690777	I'm glad you're here.
8691178	8692879	And I'm sorry for being disgusting in part A.
8700545	8704969	I did not recognize the game that was being discussed there, but Jason, you raised your hand.
8704989	8705630	You were like, yes, yes.
8705930	8706511	I did.
8706951	8717761	I adore this game because Wing Commander is one of the few dogfights in space or air that's been one of my absolute favorite series for the most part.
8718601	8727968	But Chris Roberts is, you know, everybody has one specific individual that a game or a company or somebody is known for in large part.
8728108	8731170	And Chris Roberts is the guy for Wing Commander.
8731590	8734992	And so he's creating a space dogfight MMO.
8735793	8737274	No MMO has grabbed me so far.
8737394	8744679	I played both Final Fantasy XI and WoW to like level 8 or 9 on my characters.
8745179	8747501	A couple days worth of playing never really went beyond that.
8748241	8750123	Thank you for watching!
8766736	8767276	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8796876	8797938	Do things for your faction.
8805970	8833292	it's unbelievable in a 3D universe of a game when you have all your controls in front of you in the form of a joystick and however much rudder or throttle or anything else that you have it has sounded amazing, I am a backer the shirt that I got is actually one of the most comfortable shirts I own right now which is very interesting but I have my badge, my ID tag it's looked absolutely phenomenal
8834573	8854215	or release sometime 2014 sorry Dungeon Buster said in a chat Roberts also did Freelancer when he had digital anvil and players essentially turned into a mini MMO with a number of mods added to it over the years and Duran just said Oculus support is confirmed nice Tim Tripp it sounds like Eve without the spreadsheets yes that is 100% correct
8856214	8859116	Looking at some other comments in chat real quick on Star Citizen.
8859156	8862738	Tim Tripp says, Star Citizen is the only game I've ever crowdsourced.
8863199	8865900	And Dungeon Buster says, Star Citizen is still on the fence with that one.
8865940	8867361	Not too keen on the MMO elements.
8869142	8869623	There you go.
8869643	8871344	Okay, moving back into the email land.
8871384	8872044	We have three.
8873632	8874292	Hi, OLR.
8875373	8882915	I had a fleeting thought the other day about how video games are constantly compared to movies as they seem to be aligning more and more in terms of narrative and visual fidelity.
8883195	8885316	Thank you for using fidelity in an email.
8885376	8887257	That makes me feel, have a little hope.
8888097	8891138	And there is a point of differentiation that I found interesting.
8891678	8896360	If a movie is considered a critical and commercial success, it's typically given many sequels.
8896800	8902882	With this, the original film seems more often than not become viewed as superior and pure version of the franchise as a whole.
8903582	8906884	Why is this not the same with video games that they are so closely connected to films?
8907464	8915927	When a video game enjoys mass success, it is given a sequel and almost instantly the original game is rendered obsolete due to the improved build of the game, engine, better graphics control, etc.
8916488	8917768	Curious to know your thoughts on this.
8917908	8921030	I'm going to put in right now and I'm going to use Mass Effect as my thing, so don't judge me.
8921970	8922250	Okay.
8923451	8926132	First Mass Effect, better story-wise than the later two.
8926292	8926612	Really?
8927272	8928373	I don't agree with that, but okay.
8928393	8928473	Okay.
8930596	8953319	I think that it was when you're introducing different writing teams and the story changes dramatically from the direction it was going in that's when I have some concerns but as far as playing the game Mass Effect 3 is lots of fun I have way much more fun actually just playing the game than I do the first Mass Effect especially since the Mako makes me want to puke
8953539	8958642	So if I'm understanding the question right, they want to know when the original is better than the sequel.
8958982	8963145	Because in movies, it tends to be that the original is better than the sequel, right?
8963325	8963906	Yeah.
8964106	8969989	Very rarely are sequels as good as the original unless you're talking about, I don't know, like The Godfather or Star Wars.
8970330	8972231	Yeah, well, Star Wars and so on.
8973071	8979357	A lot of times, too, that when you have a movie come out, typically sequels are done... I mean, except for when they're planned as trilogies.
8979417	8980798	For example, Star Wars.
8981499	8986023	The only three in existence in my brain, in my universe, headcanon.
8987424	8991588	Those tell a good story, and they're a cohesive unit.
8992089	8994491	Kill Bill was intended to be a full movie.
8995812	8997513	And the two parts are different enough.
8997854	8997974	Mm-hmm.
8998331	9000192	but they are a cohesive story.
9000232	9004616	When you have sequels that are made as cash cows, you know, oh, well, this movie did good.
9004656	9006037	Let's see if we can make some more money.
9006057	9007098	The Hangover Part 2 and 3.
9007758	9008018	Fuck.
9008038	9008879	Yeah, right.
9009259	9015504	But, you know, I think like one of the few movies that have actually done that successfully is like the American Pie series.
9015524	9019967	Those have all been kind of funny in their own bizarrely... The Scream movies.
9020087	9022249	Not everybody likes the sequels as much as I do, but...
9022389	9024330	Have you actually seen all of the American Pies?
9024850	9027311	I've seen two and part of three.
9027331	9028212	There are seven.
9028552	9028772	What?
9029212	9030913	Direct-to-video ones are awful, though.
9030973	9031513	Let's be real.
9031973	9032534	Just saying.
9032574	9033134	They exist.
9033734	9035015	I did want to watch the band count thing.
9035035	9039577	Let's go back to Dude's question because it could be female.
9039937	9044039	Sorry, but I don't know based on names if y'all are male or female.
9044179	9046860	It's a traditionally masculine name, but it could go the other way.
9046960	9047360	You never know.
9048480	9058043	So what the emailer said there, I think the question really was, have you played a video game where the sequel was not as good as the original?
9059144	9061204	I almost used this as the kickoff topic tonight.
9061224	9065626	The other one was a little more themed for Halloween, but I thought this was a great question too.
9065666	9072328	I was hoping I could hear from the three of you if there are any game series you can think of where you consider the first game to be a superior version despite multiple sequels.
9073172	9078135	Yes, I have a... I had to really think about this, but I have a great answer, I think, for this.
9078795	9081676	I have to go retro, really retro, but Blaster Master.
9082257	9083617	Oh, yeah.
9083637	9088360	The original was superior to anything that came out after it, like that horrible Genesis one.
9088460	9089580	But it had a better Japanese game.
9090041	9091601	Was it Space Fight Hyperion?
9091641	9095163	Yeah, but Blaster Master was the answer that came to my mind.
9095183	9098745	I don't know if you guys... I had more time to think about it, but you guys... Excite Truck.
9099986	9100426	Ha ha ha!
9100766	9101967	You're on that kick again.
9102307	9105388	Tim Tripp actually makes a good point and this is something I was going to bring up as well.
9105948	9109930	Typically the first game in a new IP doesn't receive the budget that an established IP.
9110450	9114932	So the big difference that comes in the amount of risk inherent in creating a new IP versus a new movie IP.
9116392	9143762	I think that is a great point and I think it's very true with games but to be fair it's also true to some extent with movies and I would point out those movies that they've made a million of like Saw as much as I hate those movies there's that right and then there's American Pie sorry Paranormal Activity you know the first one was made for like what a quarter like they smashed some kids piggy bank and made a movie with the money that was in it but then the others got like more and more budgets later on
9144042	9146624	Dragon Age 2 better than the first one so far so far
9172501	9174762	Oh, that's a good answer, though, to the question, Dragon Age.
9177364	9179845	I did see Saw 1 for whoever asked in chat.
9179885	9180345	I saw Saw 1.
9180425	9181426	I refused to watch any of the others.
9181966	9184407	I have a feeling that they always knew how it was going to end.
9185268	9187549	And I think they tied it together that way.
9187609	9188929	They always knew how it was going to end.
9189650	9194012	You know, there's a... And actually, I thought about it, but someone in chat mentioned it, too.
9194792	9196133	Android... Is that Alan?
9196173	9197254	It's Alan on his phone.
9197434	9198474	He's on light rail right now.
9198574	9199075	Devil May Cry.
9200995	9201655	The first one was better.
9202456	9203896	In my opinion, I liked it a lot better.
9206376	9208577	I am also tempted to say Silent Hill.
9209197	9213238	I think in some ways the first game is superior to anything that came after it.
9213338	9214958	Its limitations actually made it creepier.
9215218	9220419	However, Silent Hill 2 is kind of the climax of that whole series.
9221439	9224200	Yes, that's a sequel, but how many Silent Hills have there been after that?
9224910	9225330	Too many.
9225430	9226051	Oh, no, no.
9226291	9228012	There have only been a few Silent Hill games.
9228052	9229533	The others are fakes.
9229853	9230033	Yeah.
9230473	9232234	Anyway, they don't exist in my in my universe.
9232434	9233655	That was a fantastic question.
9234035	9239538	I would actually invite if you know, we do comments on this show every week at VOG Network dot com.
9239858	9242859	And I'd really invite you if you want to leave a comment.
9243280	9245581	And if your answer is good, I will get or like, you know,
9246861	9263370	of course Shane Pipeson I'll be very easy on you with this but I'll give you a thumbs up guaranteed so you get a little point on vognetwork.com if you have an answer to this question leave it on the episode posting at vognetwork.com for you podcast listeners because I want to know what games do you believe had better initial games than the sequels
9263590	9281544	See, Shane ranks the Silent Hill games as 2-4-1-3 I beg to differ 3-2-4-1 Now take that back, 3-2-1-4 Shane, admittedly, you value the room way more than a lot of people do The room wasn't supposed to be a Silent Hill game Remember?
9282605	9288270	I loved the E3 booth that they had for that game Yeah, that was my first Like the kitchen and everything?
9288450	9292093	Oh my god, that was awesome So, yeah, we still have more email
9292867	9293188	Yay!
9294431	9295935	We didn't need three extra stories.
9295975	9297819	We've got three extra emails tonight and that's fine.
9297879	9298721	Every gamer gets a voice.
9300024	9301045	Hey guys, Sterlok here.
9301345	9301826	Hi Sterlok.
9302566	9308151	With Halloween mere days away, I had a question to pose to both the hosts and listeners.
9308792	9313696	I wanted to know what game you can't finish due to one scene that spoils the rest of the game for you.
9314177	9315418	I'll give you my example.
9315578	9321923	Near the beginning of Homefront, there's a scene in which the child's parents are killed right in front of him and the child is seen crying for several seconds.
9322484	9325587	Even though I'm fairly certain no other such scenes exist in the game...
9326047	9331252	It completely kills the desire for me to see the rest of the game because that scene is just too disturbing for me to watch.
9331793	9335036	I wanted to know if anyone else had similar experiences with any games out there.
9335176	9336437	Keep being awesome, Starlock.
9336457	9337539	There's a movie that does that for me.
9338520	9339300	I can't watch Face Off.
9341322	9349230	I never played more than the start of Silent Hill 4 because the opening cinematic and the ambience just kind of completely creeped me out.
9350191	9379331	I think my head was just kind of in a weird place that afternoon and I think I literally just finished Silent Hill 3, moved on to Silent Hill 4 but I saw the opening cinematic which did the whole world shifting I did start the game, I did get control, I went to the window and I looked outside and saw the other apartment across the way, whatever but I never touched the game beyond that because for whatever reason the ambience just seemed too much for my brain and I put it down and never picked it back up again
9381565	9388449	If my name was Bobby Blackwolf, I might say, well, I played the demo to Ni No Kuni and then that scared me off for the rest of the game.
9388890	9394193	No, I can only think of a funny answer because I can't think of a serious one because I didn't see this email in advance.
9394213	9394853	It must have come in late.
9396794	9397335	I really don't know.
9397355	9401037	A game where a scene... Does it have to be disturbing or just it was bad?
9401177	9402918	Like there was something so bad happened.
9402938	9407741	I think the question, well, disturbing, bad, something that affected you in a way that made you not want to finish it.
9410843	9414848	Like me in the scene in Legend that I can't get past and have never finished the movie.
9415148	9415588	Oh, yeah.
9416249	9417050	You know what I'm talking about?
9417090	9417491	Yeah, I do.
9417591	9420974	And I'm trying to think if I have anything that's kind of like trigger-ish like that.
9423075	9428680	And for the record, I don't think I could play the game for exactly the same reason because it's kind of a very horrible thing for me.
9428981	9429861	I can't think of something.
9429902	9434486	If I think of something, I'll have to answer it on VOG Network or something because I really can't think of anything.
9434546	9435947	Loki, can you think of anything?
9437188	9439310	When you put in Excitebots and found it wasn't Psych Truck?
9440491	9450598	Uh, yeah, it was the first Mexico track, and you're playing it, and then the game asks you to throw a pie at a clown, and I was like, what the fuck is this?
9452279	9456382	I can't think of anything that really had a scene in the game that kind of ruined it for me.
9457443	9462206	I can think of a lot of games where you play through it, and the end is kind of lame.
9463755	9465016	And that kind of ruined it for me.
9465156	9466937	It's like, shit, why did I play this game?
9466957	9468898	This ending is fucking terrible.
9469659	9476443	But no, I can't think of anything that's like there's been something in the middle of the game, like a story thing where I just kind of went, what?
9476663	9477643	I don't like this.
9477823	9479704	I'm going to quit this game.
9481125	9483707	Tim Tripp in chat says, I watched The Descent once.
9483947	9486308	It was amazing, but I can never watch it again.
9486949	9492232	Yeah, I've definitely seen a lot of movies like that where it's like, I'm glad I saw it once and I will never watch that again.
9492512	9495974	I have a movie I can say I wasn't glad that I saw it, even though I didn't have to pay for it.
9496555	9497575	And that was Drag Me to Hell.
9497956	9498956	I went with Tiara to see it.
9499417	9499937	She loved it.
9500517	9502699	I just thought it was gross and not very good.
9502719	9504460	I watched Movie 43 the other day.
9504800	9506882	Very disappointed that that movie was not funny.
9509183	9511785	They showed you all the funny stuff in the trailer.
9511985	9518589	It did have a cameo, though, of Band Fuse, a game that will unfortunately sorely fail when it comes out in November.
9518690	9522272	But it had a cameo, so there's a bullet point for that.
9522452	9549137	I'm trying to see if the chatters have any they're still doing the Silent Hill debate in chat so there's not a lot of comments on it but Dungeon Buster does say I couldn't get past the bad full motion video acting in a PC game once well the gameplay was also pretty terrible too but he didn't say what game it was so I don't know but chatters if you have any answers to it let us know there was a game that I remember playing for a while that had something that made me super nauseous and I couldn't touch the game for a little while but then I went back I mean
9550856	9554980	I've had things that just shake me up right away and I'd have trouble finishing the scene.
9556121	9560545	And then once I digested it for a few days, I could go back and play it and be fine.
9560585	9561826	But I can't remember the last one.
9561846	9567751	I kind of didn't like the beginning of Alone in the Dark, the original Alone in the Dark, because it was hard.
9568752	9569753	That's about it.
9570453	9572255	Once again, nothing content related.
9572615	9572855	Mm hmm.
9573576	9578786	I mean, fuck, there was the torture scene in Grand Theft Auto V, and I was just like, how do I gold this thing?
9578806	9582794	Because I don't want to have to play this boring minigame again.
9584537	9586120	Oh yeah, that's kind of brutal too, I guess.
9587535	9587915	All right.
9588075	9590597	Well, if I think of something later, I'll let you know.
9590637	9591538	That was a good question, though.
9591698	9591938	Okay.
9592458	9593199	Last email.
9593519	9594279	I believe it's last.
9594439	9595660	It's the last as far as I'm concerned.
9595860	9596481	Last for tonight.
9596801	9597261	Hi, folks.
9597301	9597921	It's Ragenator.
9598402	9602744	Seeing as tonight's episode is the last one before Halloween is spelled with an A, dude.
9603125	9603505	Halloween.
9605066	9606927	God, he misspelled it twice.
9607147	9608368	He spelled it Halloween.
9608908	9615172	Hey, Hollow Man is a very good... Okay, it's a movie that came... I thought I'd send a Halloween theme to you.
9615272	9616393	It is all Hallows' Eve.
9618052	9618612	Hello.
9619193	9619553	Hello.
9619753	9628498	I know that since we're all pretty much in the same age group, around 35 plus or minus six years, we don't... We are age-inator.
9628518	9630019	I don't know about the listeners, but okay.
9630299	9631940	We all don't go trick-or-treating anymore.
9632040	9632380	Yes, we do.
9632800	9633781	And haven't done so in years.
9633921	9634301	Yes, we have.
9634361	9635302	Fuck that shit.
9635922	9637983	The Disneyland party is off the hook.
9638383	9640344	And for the record, some of us might have kids.
9641305	9643226	So they go trick-or-treating with their kids.
9643286	9645027	Who do you think eats all the candy in the middle of the night?
9645247	9645607	Mom!
9645627	9646027	I mean...
9647328	9670326	I don't eat all the candy I just go to Becky's house and take Julian's I mean, Becky, if you're listening, I'm not going to steal Julian's candy If you're listening, I'm not going to take Julian's candy Science, they keep giving them those stupid peanut butter cups Those things fucking suck My opinion, of course, everyone else likes peanut butter cups I know, whatever, everyone else likes that shit, but not me Tick and ten, you keep misspelling Halloween God, this is fucking irritating
9671949	9673830	But we may have certain Halloween traditions.
9673930	9676312	For me, it's watching movies that would be Halloween appropriate.
9676792	9678193	Alien, Aliens, Monster Squad.
9678213	9679553	God, I fucking love the Monster Squad.
9679794	9680234	Showgirls.
9681294	9681555	Girl.
9681815	9682175	Fist bump.
9682435	9684016	Yeah.
9684036	9684516	Ghostbusters, etc.
9684536	9685237	You are a whore, darling.
9685977	9686698	Y'all know shit.
9690440	9691881	I could do the hand thing, but I'm holding a mic.
9692601	9693842	And the same goes with games.
9694442	9696443	Nightmare Creatures, Resident Evil 1 through 3, blah.
9696723	9697304	I mean, etc.
9697824	9700346	Now my question for you is, do you do anything at all similar?
9700366	9700406	Um...
9704105	9726685	I sit at home and throw candy at kids I don't know about this year, we're going to something I know a lot of people did their Halloween party this weekend, like last night But we got invited to one that's after Halloween, so we're doing that And my costume that we bought the other day is for that But I don't know about on Halloween itself this year
9727105	9729066	Maybe I'll try to invite some people over to watch Showgirls.
9729226	9729706	That'll be fun.
9730467	9731147	Or I'll go to Jamie's.
9731687	9732127	You know what?
9732327	9733328	I seriously want to do that.
9733548	9734949	You're not doing anything on Halloween, right?
9735909	9736850	Is your thing on Halloween?
9736950	9738010	No, it's on like the 2nd.
9738130	9738470	That's it.
9738550	9739591	Showgirls party at my house.
9739731	9740331	Fuck yes.
9741352	9743473	We'll just push everything out of the room.
9743633	9746674	Can I bring over a kiddie pool and we'll reenact the pool scene with the cats?
9746794	9747094	Yes!
9748415	9748775	I don't know.
9748855	9750036	Midna might bite me.
9750296	9750916	I don't know.
9754454	9758177	No, but seriously, I'm totally down for showgirls at my house on Halloween.
9758217	9760138	You really shouldn't throttle cats like that.
9760518	9761518	With mimosas.
9762279	9763920	Rob.
9763940	9767502	Well, I have to drive home, but... I have a couch.
9767562	9768963	I gotta work on Friday, girl.
9769123	9769303	Girl.
9769679	9769839	No.
9770260	9774645	Okay, we have Mimosas early and then you can, you know, work it off doing the hand wave.
9774685	9775146	Two things.
9775506	9777989	Two random thoughts I just had here.
9778550	9783916	One, I would totally back any sort of Kickstarter related game that has to do with Showgirls.
9784196	9789903	Perhaps like, you know, a WarioWare type situation where you have all these different mini games that have to do with Showgirls.
9790423	9796048	And two, I just thought, remember they have that really retarded JibJab site or whatever where you can put your face on stuff?
9796188	9800732	They really need to put scenes from Sure Girls in there where you can just put your face on those characters because that'd be hilarious.
9800772	9802033	Oh my god, you know what I just remembered?
9802233	9804174	It would be Leo-tarded, Loki.
9804675	9810219	You know, I just remembered, you know all I know about JibJab is that This Land thing that they made with Romney and Bush.
9810299	9813642	I see those god-awful Christmas card singing elves things on Facebook.
9813662	9814803	I don't look at that shit.
9815023	9819948	The management at my work think those are so clever every fucking year.
9819988	9824392	All I know of JibJab is the year that they did This Land featuring, not Romney, what am I saying?
9825012	9827535	Who was the guy that ran against Bush that we all knew would lose?
9828255	9828876	Gore?
9829376	9829857	No.
9830357	9830818	John Kerry.
9830978	9831478	John Kerry.
9831778	9832759	The guy who looked like an ent.
9833900	9834101	Yes.
9834421	9834601	Yeah.
9835702	9836623	Yeah, that was pretty funny.
9837506	9837746	All right.
9838487	9838867	Let's see.
9839107	9841048	Going to chat room at live.vognetwork.com.
9841568	9843770	Tim Tripp suggests a Kinect-based Showgirls dance game.
9844810	9847392	Darte Suya said, do they do shadow casts of Showgirls?
9847432	9847952	Just wondering.
9848312	9848432	No.
9848672	9854395	And by the way, this is like the third time this year Showgirls has come up on the show, which has nothing to do with video games.
9854796	9857617	I guess that's what makes our show unique, if you can tolerate this chat.
9857897	9865762	But I will entertain this question because the one thing I look forward to every year in August is at the Castro Theater in San Francisco, California.
9865782	9865842	Yes.
9866562	9879424	the drag queen Peaches Christ and her yes that's her name Peaches Christ and her crew put on a midnight showing or no I guess it's more it's the Peaches Christ midnight mass I guess they bumped it up a little bit because we're all getting older it's more like this 8 p.m.
9879464	9892567	showing of showgirls and the bitch comes out of a volcano and they all do the dance to goddess and the whole thing and then they do free lap dances with a large popcorn and for like the past four or five years Alan and I have been going religiously to this thing
9892987	9894068	I want to go with you guys next year.
9894448	9895169	You came one time.
9895229	9897370	I came once, but I didn't get to go this last year.
9897390	9897971	I went the year before.
9898711	9900112	Because we went to Sausage Factory.
9901673	9903294	Which is a restaurant in the Castro.
9903875	9908618	But yes, I pretty much live for that day of the year because I love showgirls.
9908718	9910920	And by the way, Elizabeth Berkley on Dancing with the Stars.
9911480	9912260	I've been watching.
9912280	9913221	Gives me life.
9913501	9915381	Did you see the I'm So Excited dance?
9915401	9915921	Who didn't?
9916422	9916982	I know, right?
9917022	9918642	I don't even watch that show when I watch that.
9918722	9919643	Even Loki.
9919663	9921203	Oh, I was like, even Loki saw it.
9921323	9921903	You didn't see it?
9921923	9921963	No.
9922223	9922724	Oh, she did.
9923284	9924624	You remember Saved by the Bell, right?
9924724	9925224	Yeah, I remember.
9925284	9927125	I didn't even watch Saved by the Bell and I know that scene.
9927145	9929566	She did a dance related to that and they actually like.
9929586	9930386	They even had scenery.
9930506	9932467	Yeah, she was taking, she was ODing on jive pills.
9933227	9933867	It was great.
9934378	9936219	And the answer was, of course, The Jive.
9936360	9943665	Although, I will say this, the best person to ever do The Jive on that show was Stacey Keebler.
9944206	9944586	Just saying.
9946708	9948069	I'll have to look it up, I guess.
9949249	9951011	Alright, is that it for Mailbag?
9951631	9952232	It is for now.
9952552	9953953	Alright, then there you go.
9954093	9956795	Now we get to the part of the show with the FUs of the week.
9956995	9958697	We get a little angst out of our system.
9958777	9959157	Why?
9959597	9960178	Because...
9976961	9978652	F you to my state of unemployment.
9979175	9979558	Again.
9981540	9984142	I really want this job that I interviewed for.
9984542	9986984	It seems like such a great match.
9988605	9994370	I hate getting my hopes up too, so F you to getting my hopes up because the last few times I've been pretty dashed.
9995091	9997633	But I feel really positively.
9997673	10001376	I haven't heard anything back yet, so F you to the anticipation.
10001516	10002396	F you to the waiting room.
10003137	10007561	And I really, really want this to be successful.
10007661	10008641	I'd really like this job.
10009482	10010103	It would be perfect.
10011383	10013765	So, F you to oil paint as well.
10038550	10040170	and Rob just came up with an FU.
10040370	10050273	Yeah, I'm going next because I well, FU to the headache that I just went to the bathroom to get Advil for my headache and then FU to the fact that I stubbed my toe on the way back.
10050413	10051233	It fucking hurts.
10051273	10052053	Do you want ice?
10052533	10053113	No.
10053633	10054373	Kiss it, make it better.
10054713	10054854	Eh.
10056314	10057474	Loki, what's your FU?
10057494	10058534	We'll get a kitty to kiss it.
10058614	10059815	Kitty kisses make it all better.
10059935	10061575	She's hiding under the bed because she hates people.
10062186	10069290	My FU goes to the city of Folsom and their wonderful event that they had on Friday, their Night of a Thousand Pumpkins.
10069770	10077775	See, I don't go down to Old Folsom because it's like this hipster, historic area that they do events in, stuff like that.
10077795	10080036	What a bunch of douchebags.
10080717	10086500	But seriously though, they had their thing and see, I don't do that, but free trick-or-treating and stuff like that.
10086940	10088221	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10109679	10110260	Thanks for watching!
10133567	10136708	F you to myself for not being able to just get on a freaking plane.
10137128	10143091	It's not hard to get around places and save a hell of a lot of time and grief.
10143851	10149813	I don't mind driving, but some days, whatever.
10150093	10150954	And there was a second one.
10152995	10154015	F you to money in general.
10155313	10155953	I hear that.
10156454	10156914	I hear that.
10157855	10158235	All right.
10158275	10158615	There it is.
10158675	10159696	The FUs of the week.
10159796	10160496	So angsty.
10160837	10161337	So fresh.
10161537	10161857	All right.
10162458	10163679	Just a few more stories for you guys.
10163779	10166040	An FU to misspell Halloween.
10168021	10168882	Poor Ragenator.
10168922	10170363	But then again, we've been picking on that guy forever.
10170383	10171223	We still love you, Ragenator.
10171243	10171664	He's used to it.
10171844	10175426	Bones did it too, but I'm just being, I just use it as a lunch.
10175586	10176727	Blame autocorrect.
10176827	10177568	That's what people do.
10177748	10177988	All right.
10178849	10180949	How is that even an autocorrect thing?
10180989	10182210	Because it's misspelled.
10182770	10184130	Shouldn't autocorrect catch that?
10184150	10184730	Calm down, Lee.
10184770	10189091	That would be hilarious to change someone's autocorrect to wrong stuff.
10189751	10190371	It learns.
10190871	10196892	Dude, my phone knows when I start to type L-U-V, it goes, love you mean it.
10197132	10198533	It knows that that's a word.
10198873	10201073	I want to know how my iPad gets all these things wrong.
10201153	10203154	It knows fuckery as a word now.
10203174	10204654	My phone knows asshattery.
10206377	10209202	By the way, I have to go with Queen Simia down with capitalism.
10210704	10216174	I will say my phone always picks either we're or were wrong and it's actually kind of really annoying.
10217095	10219940	I do have OMW turned automatically into on my way.
10220535	10221456	Everybody does by default.
10221716	10227199	Jason, some flight advice from Shane Alinko in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.
10227539	10230780	Jason, if you're afraid to fly, ask for vodka on the plane.
10231161	10235783	I told a flight attendant I was scared and she gave me vodka and orange juice and it made the flight super fun.
10238499	10238959	Thanks for watching!
10255493	10258014	and you don't live that far from Denver, right?
10258094	10258294	Right.
10258354	10262195	That's where Frontiers Hub is and they're one of those companies that I would imagine would have something like that.
10262855	10263195	Check it out.
10263335	10264956	You know what the best flight I've ever had was?
10264976	10268277	It was a Southwest flight where it was me and Julie.
10269577	10278060	We were going to Las Vegas and we got on there and they totally didn't give a fuck when they were doing the flight safety.
10278160	10278960	Sounds like Southwest.
10280700	10282981	And if you have any questions, please hesitate to answer.
10283361	10286882	If you find the plane going down, you better hold on to your ass because we're going to die.
10289323	10298106	You can see people like, and then everyone else is laughing so hard that the people that got scared were embarrassed into laughing with them.
10298846	10300787	And then the guy says, just kidding.
10300807	10301107	That's like 98%.
10303868	10304728	What's our statistics?
10306208	10306749	It was great.
10306769	10307889	That's the best flight I've ever been on.
10310239	10311599	You just need liquor and pills, Jason.
10311619	10312259	It makes it easier.
10312740	10313040	All right.
10314300	10314940	Moving on.
10314980	10315620	You know what, though?
10316860	10320461	Some people don't have the patience to do the drive or the train or anything like that.
10320541	10325022	So, you know, at least you get to see such beautiful parts of the country as Elko, Nevada.
10326422	10328763	And all of southern Wyoming across I-80.
10328923	10330223	And the no-tell motels.
10330963	10337825	You know, the whole thing about flight is, you know, trying to say, is going to the bathroom on the plane worthwhile?
10337845	10337925	Yeah.
10338525	10341526	Do I need to get out of my window seat to go pee or can I hold it?
10343587	10344927	Always go to the bathroom on the plane.
10344947	10346948	You're never going to see those people again in your entire life.
10347208	10350329	And, Gamit, there's a way for a plane to have fireball on it.
10350649	10355391	You get the little... You mean the liquor, not the... The liquor.
10355731	10356651	Yes, thank you.
10356691	10361133	They do have these little flasks that are disguised as tampons.
10363655	10372382	I kid you not, they're actually for yachts Speaking of things you do because you'll never see the other people on the plane ever again This is a video game show, right?
10372422	10382431	We will talk about that at some point Yeah, we're just talking about hijacking We just said this was a slow news week Fuck it, we're filling space True, true This is our new version of the fuck it show
10383140	10385582	Alright, we gotta get to phone calls too.
10386303	10389006	Loki's got one more story for us, then we're gonna get to the phone calls.
10389026	10392469	1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
10393229	10393950	Loki, what do you have for us?
10394250	10395952	So I guess Second Life is happening soon.
10396673	10397353	November 2nd.
10397994	10398775	You mean Extra Life?
10399255	10400156	Extra Life, whatever.
10401860	10402300	Yeah, okay.
10403881	10404721	So yes, Extra Life.
10406242	10408142	And November 2nd.
10409022	10413404	So donate, sponsor people, do all that fun stuff.
10414784	10415645	Ah, it's this weekend.
10416565	10418186	For the Children's Miracle Network.
10420266	10439113	I think it's great that this charity kind of has really embraced this whole thing and kind of really made it one of their highlight fundraisers of the year I don't know if you've seen this but on PlayStation 3 they actually have an ad for Extra Life right now and if you raise certain amounts of money you get like PlayStation rewards with that so I thought that was really cool that it all kind of like integrates together so awesome
10440453	10440753	All right.
10441073	10442994	Good luck to those of you doing Extra Life, by the way.
10443474	10448255	I'd love to do it, but my wife wouldn't let me have 25 hours of pure gaming.
10449155	10451216	We need to do something charity-related.
10452436	10455277	I have things to tell you offline.
10455477	10461878	I was going to suggest we'll probably do the MS Walk again with Horde House next year, and I'd really like OLR to get involved with that, too.
10461918	10463699	Maybe we can raise a ton of money for a great cause.
10464039	10465059	So we'll look at that.
10465379	10467120	But for now, extra life.
10467160	10468201	Good luck to those of you doing it.
10468401	10471023	I'll have to watch some of those streams myself.
10471983	10475526	Alright, we're going to go right into phone calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
10475746	10481430	We're going to skip what I had on the show roll because it was a Twitter news story and it ain't even worth it.
10481450	10486293	The more I think about it, my eyes roll so far back in the back of my head I can see my brain.
10486693	10490376	If you are dying to know what I was going to report on, that whole Sessler Gate thing.
10490496	10491276	That's all I'm going to say.
10492037	10493658	I don't even know what you're talking about.
10493678	10494759	I have no idea what that is.
10495779	10496500	Well, here I go.
10496600	10497920	No, that's perfect.
10497940	10498761	Let's talk about it.
10498801	10499421	Let's talk about it.
10499441	10499761	Come on.
10500102	10500622	Okay.
10500642	10502123	And we'll talk about how ridiculous it is.
10502343	10503203	Okay, quickly.
10503663	10510967	He's whining on Twitter because supposedly there is some thing about the new console that's going to make it hard to do his job.
10511027	10513528	Like some big thing that isn't announced yet.
10514149	10516370	And it's not Xbox One, it's PlayStation 4.
10516750	10517551	That's all been deduced.
10517811	10520432	This is Reddit, Twitter, all these, you know, folks...
10522373	10525516	I don't know if that would be it necessarily because I think when Nintendo announced that nobody got warning about that.
10525536	10526196	That just happened.
10550795	10553957	and that isn't supposed to impact review videos in fair use.
10554998	10564705	My thought is, genuinely, is that it's the PlayStation 4 preview review events because it doesn't sound like they're sending out copies of PlayStation 4 games to people.
10564765	10565746	You have to come in and play them.
10566446	10569428	And that's what they do for audio CDs and a lot of those critics have to do.
10569609	10569909	Why?
10570269	10570769	Piracy.
10572170	10573471	So... Because people ruined it.
10573851	10578332	And if you have to go somewhere else to play the game, you can't get video in advance.
10578712	10581913	That might ruin your day if you are somebody who does a lot of YouTube video reviews.
10582513	10584274	So, I don't know.
10585734	10591416	It's hard for me to feel sorry, but it certainly is an interesting challenge about the new generation.
10591916	10592076	But...
10593737	10594057	Whatever.
10594237	10594777	So there you go.
10594877	10596018	In a nutshell, there's your story.
10596218	10597178	Now we can go to the calls.
10597718	10598058	Yes.
10598078	10601019	1-877-GAME-OLR I saw a Doctor Who icon.
10601039	10601599	You better answer it.
10601619	10602359	Alright, I will.
10602479	10606260	Please call 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
10606620	10608321	You can call in now and I will take the call.
10610541	10612082	In the meantime, do we have last minute stories?
10612122	10612782	Probably not tonight.
10614142	10614502	No.
10614522	10615803	We had hardly any stories tonight.
10615883	10617223	I think you just took the last minute story.
10617728	10618468	Yeah, there you go.
10619369	10622690	I did see a couple tweets, and they were things worth mentioning, so I want to get to that.
10623350	10628051	But again, if you want to call, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or use the name on Skype, Orange Launch Radio.
10628131	10628972	I want Bobby to call.
10630132	10631512	But you excluded him in chat.
10631632	10632633	I didn't exclude him.
10632693	10633453	I said other people.
10633473	10635193	I just said we also want some new people, too.
10635594	10635914	All right.
10636494	10639695	I encourage... Let's get to the phones and see who's there.
10639935	10640895	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
10640915	10641255	Who's this?
10642456	10643016	Hey, what's up, guys?
10643036	10643676	This is Kaijudo.
10643976	10644816	Hey, Kaijudo.
10644876	10645217	What's up?
10645297	10645717	Long time no talk.
10645737	10646597	Hey, Dr. Who icon.
10648857	10649497	Yeah, nothing much.
10649537	10654320	I just wanted to answer the question that one of your listeners proposed to you earlier today.
10656401	10657082	How was it worded?
10657122	10660444	Where you played a game and it was so disturbing that it made you stop?
10660804	10663906	Yeah, I had a scene that made you just completely not want to play the rest of it.
10664066	10668128	Yeah, my game is Grand Theft Auto Vice City.
10668228	10672351	There's a mission in that game where I think there's like a mob boss or something.
10672951	10674532	And they want you to kill his wife.
10674572	10675853	They want you to run her off the road.
10676986	10689702	and I couldn't do that for the life of me like you you hear her like literally asking you like why are you doing this to me why are you trying to kill me it was so disturbing that I turned the game off never finished it never played it and that was back in 2002
10692233	10697955	You know, it's hard for me to sit here and go, wow, you're so crazy for that answer.
10697975	10700035	That's pretty admirable.
10700595	10702736	Yeah, you just sound like a nice guy to me.
10702976	10707957	Yeah, I mean, if it was the mob guy, I would have shot him in the face, no problem.
10708117	10709297	Lock him in the trunk, do whatever.
10709357	10710858	But I don't know.
10710898	10713238	It was just the fact that I felt she was an innocent.
10713319	10714679	You know, like when you play Grand Theft Auto.
10715399	10721123	I mean, anyone that you kill in that game, they're usually just criminals and they're either going to kill you before you kill them.
10721644	10725887	So you kind of work that out in your mind that, okay, this is justifiable.
10725987	10728669	But I don't know, just killing that woman wasn't justifiable.
10728709	10732171	I could research and see if she had a meth lab or a child smuggling ring.
10732472	10736815	Well, this was in the 80s, so there weren't any meth labs.
10736975	10739897	If anything, she was a cocaine queen or whatever the fuck.
10740177	10740417	Yeah, yeah.
10769638	10770659	It doesn't get that real.
10771039	10771699	It's just funny.
10772820	10774641	So my brain can easily differentiate.
10774661	10779664	But I can see where if this poor innocent woman is screaming her head off, like, please don't kill her.
10779904	10783726	Yeah, it's kind of like, maybe I don't want to do this.
10784506	10785527	Makes sense.
10786407	10787268	It was exactly that.
10787288	10791550	It was the fact that she was screaming and literally talking to me and asking me why.
10791630	10793992	And grant the photo, you don't talk.
10794352	10796193	So I couldn't really explain to her.
10796753	10797054	Why?
10797474	10800619	Or you're trying to explain from the couch and it's not working.
10802723	10804505	So, well, that is a great answer.
10804726	10808592	I'm curious to know if Loki remembers that part because he's the big Grand Theft Auto guy.
10809652	10811835	Um, no, I don't remember that.
10812015	10814598	I don't remember if I ever finished.
10814838	10817301	I don't ever remember finishing Vice City.
10817381	10818302	I don't know if I ever did.
10820044	10823808	Because you didn't really, really get crazy about Grand Theft Auto until just the last one, right?
10823828	10826631	I don't think I ever finished 3 or Vice City.
10827773	10828333	Maybe I did.
10828393	10829074	I don't remember.
10829114	10830155	It was a long time ago.
10832118	10834440	Loki was rocking out to the music so hard he didn't even hear it.
10834460	10835301	He didn't even hear the woman.
10835321	10836142	It's like, ooh, cheat codes.
10836182	10837223	Ooh, I'm gonna go blow stuff up.
10837263	10838485	And that was pretty much it, you know?
10838765	10839486	Same with San Andreas.
10839526	10840887	I know I didn't finish San Andreas.
10841888	10844091	And I always wanted to finish it because, I mean, I love Vice City.
10844131	10844852	I love the 80s.
10844912	10846273	I mean, it had, like, a nice vibe to it.
10846313	10847875	But just that part, man.
10847975	10848576	Couldn't get by it.
10848916	10849337	But, um...
10850267	10864256	I'm gonna hang up now, let some more calls get in Alright I was talking to you guys again, I'll be calling in more Sounds good, good to hear from you Alright, take care buddy, bye 1877GAMEOLR, our username on Skype, Orange Lingerie Did you even get to compliment the Doctor Who icon?
10864456	10878344	I think you did at the beginning I did He did have a Doctor Who icon And then the whole time during his phone call I was playing the old theme since he had the 80s icon Yeah, it was classic Who, not new Who Are you gonna go to that whole 3D screening of Doctor Who or whatever I heard about this?
10878364	10879185	No, because I hate people
10879825	10881086	Oh, that's a fair answer.
10882086	10883547	I hate going to the movies.
10883647	10885408	Like, I don't like going to opening night anything.
10885608	10886188	I don't either.
10886308	10888449	Unless it's like something I'm super excited about.
10888489	10890230	But it's like I have to see The Hunger Games.
10890490	10891451	God, catching fire.
10891471	10893051	I just don't like people that much.
10893912	10894452	I don't blame you.
10894672	10896673	Well, we like this person that's calling in right now.
10896733	10897734	Hi, are you there?
10898494	10900335	I'm right here and I'm glad you like this person.
10900655	10901695	I do like this person.
10901736	10902596	Hey, Rama, how you doing?
10903533	10904614	I'm doing pretty good.
10904634	10905775	A little tired, but I'm good.
10906015	10907776	Yeah, was there a con this weekend?
10908737	10917023	No, but I work, and now my commute, instead of being from Brooklyn to Midtown Manhattan, is from Brooklyn to Jersey, so three-hour commute every single day.
10917223	10918064	Oh my gosh.
10918424	10927111	But I was going to say, as far as the anime cons go, too, Halloween is the one time of the year where you're supposed to dress up, so it's like, it's cosplayers' vacation.
10927131	10927211	Yeah.
10928197	10930619	or as I like to call it, National Cosplayer Zen.
10931680	10932220	Fair enough.
10932601	10934122	You know I'm just teasing you.
10934162	10935183	I'm all for it.
10935363	10936284	What else is on your mind, buddy?
10937164	10938826	Three things, and I'll make it quick.
10939866	10942869	Number one, and this is a frugal question of the week.
10943169	10944250	I'll make this part brief.
10944530	10947613	I was playing Bioshock, going through the level.
10948273	10952256	My old roommate was standing there with his D&D crew, and they watched me play the game.
10952477	10956580	I come to this one section where there is a casket sitting on a shelf.
10957040	10957541	I'm like, okay.
10958499	10966582	I walk over to it, the casket explodes, there are creatures coming at me, I'm killing them, and I'm like, what the fuck is this?
10966783	10968343	Holy shit, what the fuck?
10968763	10974466	I kill them all, and I'm just staring at the screen, I pause it, and I drop the controller, and it's like, fuck this, I'm done.
10974986	10976967	Well played, Bioshock, well played.
10977047	10977887	Well, there you go.
10978968	10982249	That is a scary game that nobody brought up earlier, so, good answer.
10982869	10984830	Yeah, but mind you, I was playing with the lights on.
10988663	10989503	What else is on your mind, buddy?
10991164	10991384	Anyone?
10991404	10991644	Anyone?
10992785	10994106	No, I was just saying, what else is on your mind, buddy?
10994586	10995186	My bad, my bad.
10995686	11004771	Second thing, this was passed to me by someone on my fan page, and they're spreading the words of their Extra Life campaign out of Ohio.
11009119	11010541	Happy Family and Friends
11029669	11036131	They have not mentioned, but they did say there's going to be a lot of video games, anime, Kevin Smith, crude humor.
11036151	11037131	Did I mention Kevin Smith?
11037931	11040912	Is Kevin Smith going to be there or are they just watching Chasing Amy?
11042312	11043933	Nobody watches Chasing Amy.
11043973	11044753	I thought you knew this.
11044793	11045233	Fuck you.
11045313	11046213	I love that movie.
11046793	11047153	Hey!
11048754	11051034	See, you're a traitor.
11051774	11053935	I will let you slide on it because you didn't say Jersey Girl.
11055077	11056757	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
11074612	11077374	Yeah, I already told him this.
11077534	11078715	Now, I'm going to let you guys know.
11079015	11088881	As you know, I have this issue with Shamestop and how I refuse to give them my money for the way they treat some of their customers and their products and this and that.
11088981	11089761	Or their employees.
11090522	11091122	Yep, them too.
11092883	11097306	Long story short, old roommate reimbursed me money for a game that he can't find.
11097386	11099547	So I go buy a used copy.
11099927	11101789	I go in, they have like this special
11102813	11106854	So what made you decide that ethically you're going to decide, okay, I'll boycott GameStop most of the time?
11129594	11136961	I figure I might as well get a good deal on a used game as long as I have the game, the manual, and the original box art.
11137141	11139524	If not, I'll go to Amazon and spend an extra ten bucks.
11142807	11147111	I mean, eventually you just can't boycott fully forever.
11147151	11148673	Eventually you get to that point where you know what?
11150994	11151455	Might as well.
11151475	11154175	I'm just going to go in, get what I want, and leave.
11154796	11161558	As long as they don't ask me for power rewards, as long as they don't ask me to reserve this or that, I just want the game, and I want to go.
11162578	11166819	That's part of the reason I like Amazon, because like Jamie, I don't like people sometimes.
11166879	11170180	And Amazon, you just click your thing, or any online site, really.
11170220	11175102	I know I keep pimping that one, but you just go on, you order what you want, and then it magically shows up at your door.
11175122	11175622	It's great.
11176689	11177870	At least you don't have to deal with this.
11178050	11184833	You go into the store to buy something, headphones are on, and they're talking to you like you can hear them.
11185173	11185413	Right.
11186034	11195558	You can kind of hear them, but you know the transaction, what you're doing, so you just want them to just pull up the screen, you can punch in your rewards card, pay for your item, and leave.
11197359	11200640	Alright, well Ranma, I'm going to let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thank you as always for the call.
11201121	11201681	Ain't no problem, broski.
11201701	11203362	And everybody listen to Anime Jam Session.
11204002	11204983	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
11224622	11225002	Never.
11225022	11227904	I was like, Ranma, what the fuck is going on?
11227964	11228685	Okay, for the year.
11228725	11229465	That makes sense.
11230226	11232548	I think my funeral services might be at a con.
11232568	11234369	That's how much of a con whore I am.
11234929	11245937	Ranma, not that I want to talk about that day anytime soon, but if I happen to still be here when that happens, I will see to it that the fucking kids pay their respects to the great Black Luigi.
11247058	11250120	Will we be putting up the death note with your name in it?
11251742	11253263	This time, I will allow it.
11253723	11254004	All right.
11254604	11255145	Take care, buddy.
11255425	11256366	For the record, one last thing.
11256886	11261330	Every time I see someone refer to SNK, I don't think of the anime.
11261430	11265634	I think of my and all the King of Fighters games.
11265654	11267815	I always think of Capcom versus SNK, too, which is me.
11267936	11270718	I keep thinking of Shingeki no Kyojin.
11270978	11272019	I just start reading the manga.
11272319	11272920	It's phenomenal.
11273180	11274101	Yeah, I don't think I'm gonna.
11299877	11328926	SSJ100 Matt sent us a few tweets this one you sent us about Neon FM was in last week's show just a heads up but the other one is about the Conan O'Brien thing where he played the scary games I've seen the tweets about this I haven't watched this yet but I'll have to check this out I don't want to play it over the air because you know it's Conan's thing but check that out I'm sure it's hilarious because Conan is hilarious and I paid a lot of money to see him live after he got kicked off of NBC and it was worth every penny so good times
11329686	11330227	So check that out.
11330267	11333208	He plays Slender the Eight Pages and Amnesia, and I'm sure it's great.
11334449	11335850	TigerClaw sends us a few tweets.
11336751	11341353	Classic games are now preserved and accessible on Archive.org.
11341774	11342554	How does this work?
11342694	11344956	Because isn't emulation kind of a gray area?
11344976	11345856	I'm trying to read about this.
11346437	11354882	The Internet Archive has created the Historical Software Archive, which is significantly older software runnable in a browser, which includes many games.
11355342	11356503	Thanks to J.S.
11356663	11376318	Mess, the multi-emulator super system available in Java Jason Scott from the Internet Archives site says We have the ability to watch video, listen to music, and read documents right in our browsers Not so with classic software until now Included in the collection are games such as Mystery House by Roberto Williams
11377318	11379259	Karataka by Jordan Mechner.
11379279	11379959	I remember that game.
11380299	11383960	And Atari's infamous E.T., the extraterrestrial.
11384380	11385161	I had no idea.
11385661	11389022	Like, does the copyright lift on this after so many years?
11389162	11391002	I thought it was like 75 years and then some.
11391502	11394543	Because the Disney laws keep getting passed to keep Mickey Mouse out of public domain.
11394563	11396524	They might not have renewed that one.
11397257	11397978	I guess that's true.
11399379	11399699	Who cares?
11400120	11406245	Or maybe because emulation is such a gray area, because these games are so old, like maybe it's just not a big deal.
11406385	11406685	I don't know.
11407906	11408727	But that's still pretty cool.
11409307	11410388	I'll check that out after the show.
11411129	11412750	One other quick tweet here from Tigerclaw.
11412810	11415812	It's about the Mortal Kombat film director who
11416693	11445524	Kevin Tancho-Rowan I'm totally mispronouncing that name, sorry He's the director of Mortal Kombat Legacy and he has walked away from it He talked about it on Twitter He did the Mortal Kombat Legacy web series and that was after Mortal Kombat Rebirth New Line Cinema actually asked him to direct a future film in the Mortal Kombat universe but he said, quote After three years of combat, I've decided to move on to other creative opportunities I wish everyone involved in the movie a big success Thanks
11446104	11446684	I can see that.
11446985	11448906	Three years is a long time to spend on one project.
11448926	11451548	You might not want your life and your career defined by the one thing.
11451928	11453149	So I can see that.
11453929	11460714	Speaking of video games becoming movies, you know, BlizzCon is in two weeks, and there's going to be lots of Warcraft movie news that comes out of that, I'm sure.
11461054	11462455	I think they cast their first person, too.
11462475	11465837	I think I remember seeing a story on that, too, that their first official person is cast in that.
11467919	11474543	Oh, I know TigerClaw tweeted that at some point, but I don't have it up on the screen right now, and it is live radio.
11477305	11479166	I think it's probably on the Horde House page.
11480367	11481668	I'm sure it got posted there.
11481769	11482789	Trying to find it right now.
11484511	11485471	Ah, I can't bring it up.
11485511	11486512	I don't remember the guy's name.
11486532	11487853	Maybe somebody will yell it out in chat.
11487893	11492317	But it was from some Viking thing on TV.
11492997	11494258	I didn't recognize the name of the guy.
11494939	11497100	There was stuff about Colin Farrell in the past.
11497301	11498321	Yeah, those are rumors.
11499022	11503385	Him and Paula Patton, who is Robin Thicke's wife.
11504566	11533802	is rumored for that movie too we don't know who they're playing though they haven't said anything about that so alright we'll get into more of that on Horde House but for now this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio Travis Fimmel thank you thank you this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio is about to an end hey I want to thank you guys for tuning in and listening to the show thank you for supporting our little podcast that we do here every week we do this for you guys you're great and if you like what you hear here at Orange Lounge Radio please just help us spread the word

11593460	11596325	Wow, what is my final thought?

11600751	11601672	Thank you for watching!
11624465	11626587	and then I have to figure out what my Thanksgiving plans are going to be.
11626768	11633734	But if I do come back to San Francisco, that means I'm going to do the 22-hour drive I-80 back home because that's the only one that makes sense.
11634154	11636456	Well, maybe we'll see you right back here on OLR next month.
11636476	11637077	Quite possibly.
11637737	11640039	You're always welcome at the house anytime, Jason.
11640840	11641140	All right.
11642121	11642402	Let's see.
11642422	11643122	How about DarkSakura?
11643142	11643683	Your final thought.
11644523	11645965	Man, there's... Ed.
11646906	11647546	Ed, move out.
11647786	11648047	Fuck Ed.
11648067	11648907	That's the final thought.
11649768	11657451	I'm absolutely irritated and I'm just having all three characters in my village ignore Ed because fuck him.
11658932	11660133	Not really because he's disgusting.
11661873	11664194	I'm sorry you don't wear purple eyeshadow when you're blue.
11664715	11665355	It just doesn't work.
11666516	11670098	And you don't give people jackhammers I'll tell all the Smurfs I know your fashion tips You know what?
11670358	11690130	Okay No, mine is This has been the night for nostalgia Because, you know, Pokemon and rival schools But then Ikuma You are wonderful, Ikuma-san But you had to mention Last Blade And I love that series So I want a new Last Blade game too
11692396	11699762	My final thought tonight is fuck this headache and bless that bottle of wine that I'm going to get to open because Alan was able to get home a little earlier.
11699922	11701363	Because you want a bigger headache.
11701403	11702024	That's right.
11702524	11704746	Thank you, Alan, for running and making light rail.
11706226	11706726	He can't hear me.
11706766	11707427	He has headphones on.
11707947	11709468	All right.
11709548	11709748	Oh, no.
11709768	11710128	Here he is.
11711309	11712510	He came out and said, you're welcome.
11712530	11712930	Thank you, Alan.
11712970	11713971	Rob, we bred.
11714311	11714731	Finally.
11715032	11715672	Yay, Jamie.
11715712	11716272	We made it.
11716853	11717093	Wait.
11717693	11718114	Scratch that.
11718934	11720155	Loki, last but not least.
11720175	11721476	We breed puzzle pieces, remember?
11721976	11722977	Loki, last but not least.
11722997	11723537	Your final thought.
11723803	11729264	My final thought is I'm still acquiring pieces for my portable screen thing.
11730345	11738627	I've actually been using that screen quite a bit at work, because that's what I play on my PlayStation 3, so it's working out really good.
11740307	11751851	And I'm now trying to find an audio amp, which I'm going to go with an old USB speaker, and the battery, which I have one picked out already, and now a DC converter.
11751991	11752091	So...
11753411	11757455	and then I just need to design a case and vacuum form that bitch.
11758637	11759337	Which will be hard.
11759578	11759978	Good luck.
11759998	11761299	The virtual boy looks so weird.
11762040	11763341	I love my virtual boy hat.
11763682	11764002	I love it.
11764022	11765183	Alright, that's really it.
11765243	11765644	We're done.
11765924	11766445	We're out of here.
11766745	11768347	Thank you guys very much for listening to our show.
11768567	11770208	We'll be back next week to do it all again.
11770349	11770669	Episode 526.
11770709	11771610	Until then, Jason, take us out.
11775069	11777631	You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio
