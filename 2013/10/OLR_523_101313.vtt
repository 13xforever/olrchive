00:00.000 --> 00:18.360
This week, Microsoft denies that Kinect gathers data for advertising. A classic RPG series

00:18.360 --> 00:22.520
is headed to iOS and Android, and tonight we interview SoCal Mike Kennedy about Retro

00:22.520 --> 00:29.760
Magazine and its Kickstarter campaign. All this and more begins right now.

00:29.760 --> 00:34.840
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

00:34.840 --> 00:41.960
where every gamer has a voice. This is Orange Lounge Radio here on October the 13th, 2013

00:41.960 --> 00:48.840
with episode number 523 of our program. My name is Rob Roberts joining you over the next

00:48.840 --> 00:53.700
few hours to talk about video games, gaming culture, and so on and so on with my co-host,

00:53.700 --> 00:57.480
say hello first off to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers. I just thought you were channeling

00:57.480 --> 01:01.040
Bea Arthur like you said earlier. I am a little bit. I have the raspy voice

01:01.040 --> 01:08.640
going on today. Those of you that follow VOG Network know that Jessica from Understation

01:08.640 --> 01:12.760
Live and I were both involved with a production here in Sacramento at the Rocky Horror Picture

01:12.760 --> 01:17.960
Show. Well, that occurred last night and I'm proud to say we sold out. It was 500 plus

01:17.960 --> 01:24.280
seats and the cast did an amazing job, but I was the host or MC hosting the whole thing

01:24.280 --> 01:29.880
and that involved a lot of screaming. You know the whole thing at the top of my voice

01:29.880 --> 01:35.720
and trying to be funny, improv and all that, but it was great and I will say by missing

01:35.720 --> 01:40.720
the show you missed this really, I can't even repeat it, but I had to do a Pokemon. That's

01:40.720 --> 01:47.000
all I'm going to say. Let's just say. I probably, keep in mind that the shows that I've had

01:47.000 --> 01:52.240
the most fun at were the ones where I did crew stuff. Oh yeah, yeah. I remember you

01:52.240 --> 01:57.360
used to do tech related things. Do you play Dr. Scott one time? I was Dr. Scott one time

01:57.360 --> 02:03.160
and I was the curtain and the rope and I held the tank up. Last night I played Dr. Scott.

02:03.160 --> 02:06.440
I actually played Eddie. It was the first time I played Eddie for about, oh God, the

02:06.440 --> 02:10.880
past like, it's probably been like 12 years since I played Eddie, but uh, yeah, good old

02:10.880 --> 02:17.080
meatloaf. Yeah. All right. But um, I still think it's ironic that in the original production

02:17.080 --> 02:22.840
that he was Dr. Scott and not, he was both. Well, he was, he was both at one point and

02:22.840 --> 02:26.720
uh, that's why a lot of movie shadow casts will do both, especially if they're stretched

02:26.720 --> 02:32.960
for people like we were. So, but um, but no, I, I have more fun when I'm not looking at

02:32.960 --> 02:37.360
the crowd when they're behind me and I'm not looking at a sea of people. See the crowd

02:37.360 --> 02:40.520
thing doesn't bother me at all. That's just, I guess that's just part of my, like, you

02:40.520 --> 02:44.480
know, how I'm wired. Like, you know, I'm able to do, well this, this is easy. You are an

02:44.480 --> 02:48.560
attention whore. This is easy. Yeah, but you make it sound like I'm like self centered

02:48.560 --> 02:52.080
or something like that too. And I really like to think I'm not. Some people are fine with

02:52.080 --> 02:56.140
the public speaking thing and it's not that I have a problem with public speaking, although

02:56.140 --> 03:01.140
I actually have a pathological fear of microphones and public speaking. Yet here you are. No

03:01.140 --> 03:04.980
microphones and public speaking as in front of a crowd with a microphone. I hate the way

03:04.980 --> 03:10.080
my voice sounds amplified. Oh, here in the echo and all that. Exactly. I don't even like

03:10.080 --> 03:14.960
listening to myself in recordings. Yeah. So I actually have to practice modulating

03:14.960 --> 03:21.180
my voice. Um, well my voice is definitely be modulated tonight. Well I'm running on

03:21.180 --> 03:26.800
four hours of sleep because apparently the insomnia creature decided to bitch slap me

03:26.800 --> 03:34.000
and I woke up at like two in the morning, four in the morning, five in the morning.

03:34.000 --> 03:38.720
Then the cat woke me up. So I was like, I don't play mass effect. I spent more time

03:38.720 --> 03:43.600
doing screen captures. All right. Let's also, let's also introduce, cause we could talk

03:43.600 --> 03:48.400
about coffee and everything else all night long, but we do want to get to video games.

03:48.400 --> 03:52.980
Say hello to tech master Loki. Yeah. Hey, how you doing Loki? I'm doing all right. Yeah.

03:52.980 --> 03:57.560
Did you do any theater productions this weekend? Have you ever been involved with theater?

03:57.560 --> 04:00.440
You don't really strike me as the type, but maybe like in high school from like a drama

04:00.440 --> 04:05.840
class in high school. No, not really. I had to choose in high school. I could take drama

04:05.840 --> 04:11.380
or I could take band and I'm going to be honest, I felt kind of guilted by my parents

04:11.380 --> 04:16.480
into doing band because it was like, Oh Rob, your dead grandpa left you this clarinet.

04:16.480 --> 04:19.680
And you know, he would be really proud of you if you would go into band. Oh, you want

04:19.680 --> 04:24.060
to go into drama, but, but you know, your dead grandpa played the clarinet and you know,

04:24.060 --> 04:27.300
he died before you were born and you know, you're named after him and this is the one

04:27.300 --> 04:34.440
thing he left you and you want to go to drama. Really? So, but, but band nerd represent.

04:34.440 --> 04:37.960
Well I don't, I, and I don't regret my time in band at all. It was a great, like, I'm

04:37.960 --> 04:45.400
not like, I'm not like shady, but I, if I was left to the choice, it's not what I would

04:45.400 --> 04:49.340
have picked, but I don't regret it at all. The only thing that's kind of sad about it

04:49.340 --> 04:55.080
is that since I graduated high school, I have not touched the clarinet at all. I have not

04:55.080 --> 04:58.800
played the clarinet since the day I was 18 and graduated high school. I told you what

04:58.800 --> 05:02.820
happened to my saxophone, didn't I? It was in, I, when I moved out here, I had to leave

05:02.820 --> 05:06.900
it behind. So I loaned it to my friend who is a music major, so she could take the saxophone

05:06.900 --> 05:11.060
class and cause I played saxophone, I played contour alto clarinet, I played alto clarinet,

05:11.060 --> 05:18.140
I played damn near everything that was saxophone or clarinet. And, um, she, uh, left it when

05:18.140 --> 05:21.900
she moved to Germany, she left it in her mother's attic in D'Iberville, Mississippi. And then

05:21.900 --> 05:27.220
this hurricane named Katrina came in and stole her roof and my saxophone. Oh, not good. The

05:27.220 --> 05:31.100
end. Not good. Hey, how about that? Loki was trying to talk about his life when we made

05:31.100 --> 05:37.540
it about us. How representative of Orange Laundry. The only way I'd ever want to learn

05:37.540 --> 05:42.180
or, you know, learn to play the saxophone is just, and really only just a small part

05:42.180 --> 05:47.820
would be just to learn how to play the chord for Epic Sax Man and just do that. Cause that's

05:47.820 --> 05:54.180
all you really need to know anyways. So that's it. I did, by the way, find a video clip on

05:54.180 --> 06:00.860
Tumblr of a guy going in shirtless on a skateboard playing careless whisper on a saxophone.

06:01.100 --> 06:05.540
Nice. All right. Going to our chat room because you know, we do tape live every Sunday night

06:05.540 --> 06:10.740
at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern at the voice of geeks network of vog network.com.

06:10.740 --> 06:15.180
We are live right after the Bobby black Wolf show and we love interacting with our listeners.

06:15.180 --> 06:20.460
We do call it the show where every gamer has a voice and a reginator using his voice to

06:20.460 --> 06:25.200
poke fun a little bit saying, but sky, did you go to band camp and tell stories that

06:25.200 --> 06:34.320
began with this one time at band camp? Okay. So I mean, that movie really just like worked

06:34.320 --> 06:38.800
that line to death, but band camp is a real thing for those of you that didn't do like

06:38.800 --> 06:44.320
we, I don't know if you're not like that, but no. Well, okay. No, no, no, no, no. Okay.

06:44.320 --> 06:48.480
We didn't have a camp. Yeah. We didn't like go off into the woods or anything. It was

06:48.480 --> 06:53.680
go to school for eight hours a day. So you can get a jump on learning your field show

06:53.680 --> 06:59.040
music and, and, and for me in Alabama, it's March in the humid with mosquitoes and lose

06:59.040 --> 07:02.880
your shoes in the swamp that we had to practice in. Okay. But I will say this, we would stay

07:02.880 --> 07:06.080
overnight. One of the nights, like it would usually be like a Friday, Saturday, Sunday,

07:06.080 --> 07:10.080
and we would stay overnight at the school on a Saturday and sleep in the gymnasium because we

07:10.080 --> 07:14.640
were supposed to be learning about what it's like when the band goes out on tour. Mind you,

07:14.640 --> 07:19.920
we did the overnight thing on tour once my junior year and we stayed in a motel six or whatever the

07:19.920 --> 07:24.720
Canadian version of motel six is some, you know, maple room six. No, I'm kidding. I don't know

07:24.720 --> 07:27.520
what it was called up. There was some discount chain in Canada is where we stayed. Right.

07:28.640 --> 07:34.080
Well, okay. But here's the thing, like a band camp, you put a bunch of like horny ass teenagers

07:34.080 --> 07:39.440
in high school together in a group and have them staying overnight. Yes. Some dumb things,

07:39.440 --> 07:43.120
dumb stupid teenager things are going to happen. And yes, there were games for all camp.

07:43.840 --> 07:50.560
Yeah. I mean, exactly. That's not unique to band. It's any mixed gender camp or really same gender

07:50.560 --> 07:56.720
camp too. So I have to tell you now, this is my, my funny band camp story that I told Becky the

07:56.720 --> 08:02.240
other day is that there's this one girl who was a clarinet player. I played saxophone and our

08:02.240 --> 08:06.480
sections would meet up at certain points in the show where I would hear bits and pieces of her

08:06.480 --> 08:12.320
wanting to come up with a chicken restaurant geared toward women called peckers. Okay. So

08:12.320 --> 08:16.080
clearly here we go stealing the show again, dark soccer and I big old band nerds. What kind of kid

08:16.080 --> 08:21.680
were you in high school? Logie in high school. Yeah. I do pretty much the same stuff in high

08:21.680 --> 08:28.000
school. I do now. I seriously like have a wife and kid. Yeah. I mean, let's see in high school.

08:28.000 --> 08:33.440
I, well, I took art all four years in high school and then one year I took drama as well. Um,

08:34.320 --> 08:39.600
but let's see my art class. Like at one point I actually had a free period. So I ended up going

08:39.600 --> 08:44.080
into my art class and landing the PCs together and playing games on that. Of course it was red

08:44.080 --> 08:52.560
alert or Duke Nukem 3D. And then, um, I used to bring my PlayStation one to, uh, that was actually,

08:52.560 --> 09:00.400
I think I got my PlayStation one 97. Oh my God. I feel old. And so, um, yeah, I'd used to bring

09:00.400 --> 09:07.280
that to school and you play during lunch and I still do that now. I bring my systems to work and

09:07.280 --> 09:11.920
I play during the night. I was a big nerd in high school, high school too. Actually, this is junior

09:11.920 --> 09:17.760
high. I distinctly remember going into, I think it was Mr. Abe was his name. He was the science

09:17.760 --> 09:22.960
teacher. I don't know if he's out there in the world still, but he was a, um, a science teacher

09:22.960 --> 09:28.080
at, um, Ike junior high school where I went to junior high and we used to go into the classroom

09:28.080 --> 09:34.400
and play tank wars. V was a tank wars. VGA was the full name of it. I think there was scorched

09:34.400 --> 09:40.720
earth. It was after that, but tank wars, I mean, and it was me and some buddies that I'm still in

09:40.720 --> 09:44.960
touch with his day. We used to play those tank shooting games to death, but you know what's funny?

09:44.960 --> 09:49.280
I don't really care for worms now, which is kind of like, like worms is kind of like taking a bite

09:49.280 --> 09:54.000
out of that same genre, like scorched earth and all that. But like for me, nothing will ever match

09:54.000 --> 09:58.560
like the mega nuke in scorched earth. Like that was always fun to watch when your friends fire

09:58.560 --> 10:03.360
that thing off and swallow up like seven tanks hole. See, you're like, you know, I think you

10:03.360 --> 10:07.840
and I would have been buds. My senior year of high school, we had someone bring one of those,

10:07.840 --> 10:14.800
um, generator powered TVs and a super Nintendo because that's what was new at the time was super

10:14.800 --> 10:22.720
Nintendo. And okay, grandma, tell us more. But it was when I moved into the dorm, cause I was the

10:22.720 --> 10:28.240
only one in our block that had a TV in the, in the dorm room that, uh, uh, my roommate's boyfriend

10:28.240 --> 10:33.600
left his PlayStation over. We played a lot of to Shinden and my room was very popular. Yeah.

10:33.600 --> 10:38.480
And um, we also watched a lot of sailor moon in college. I had a super Nintendo with super Mario

10:38.480 --> 10:44.160
cart and it's the only reason most of those kids wanted to talk to me. So I also had like

10:44.160 --> 10:50.160
VHS copies of like the entire run of Ronan warriors on VHS because I stayed up to tape

10:50.160 --> 10:56.240
them every day. Nice. So my, my room was like anime central and I had all of a, like I had

10:56.240 --> 11:01.120
Ron the project fan subs. That's awesome. And I had an unsubbed copy of the Rotsky doji.

11:03.520 --> 11:07.680
So we would make up our own, um, no, we would make up our own dialogue to it.

11:07.680 --> 11:11.200
I love hearing about what a colossal nerd you were and still are

11:11.200 --> 11:14.880
dark saga, but we have to keep the show moving because we do have an interview coming up in

11:14.880 --> 11:19.040
like 10 minutes. Uh, I do want to teach tonight. We do have an interview live here on orange launch

11:19.040 --> 11:24.640
radio. Uh, the interview is with Mike Kennedy. He is a, he's with the website game gavel.com,

11:24.640 --> 11:28.400
which is kind of like an eBay for video games. Pretty cool little thing. Uh, but what he's

11:28.400 --> 11:33.520
really here to talk about tonight is the Kickstarter for retro, which is a throwback

11:33.520 --> 11:37.840
video game magazine. That's going to be independently published and they're getting a lot of

11:37.840 --> 11:42.480
just names out there in the industry to kind of freelance for this. So, uh, excited to type to

11:42.480 --> 11:46.880
talk to Mike about that project. And that'll be in about 10 minutes here live. If you do want to join

11:46.880 --> 11:52.000
us in our chat room, live at dot vog network.com is the place to be, uh, before I get into gaming

11:52.000 --> 11:57.360
weeks, I had another kickoff topic I wanted to talk about quickly. Um, I wanted to talk about

11:57.360 --> 12:02.480
loaning games out and experiences that you guys have had with loaning out games and loaning out

12:02.480 --> 12:06.960
systems and maybe the good or the bad experience, because I have a really funny story. Uh, the

12:06.960 --> 12:11.440
listeners may not be aware of this, but, uh, somebody from orange launch radios past for the

12:11.440 --> 12:15.760
first few years of the show, you might remember a gal who used to come on the show an awful lot

12:15.760 --> 12:21.280
named rice princess. And I even back when orange laundry was a station way back in the day on life

12:21.280 --> 12:26.640
365, uh, I co-hosted a show with her called outside the box. And, uh, now she just goes by

12:26.640 --> 12:32.320
princess Irene, I believe is like her new preferred handle. Uh, princess Irene got married on Thursday

12:32.320 --> 12:38.480
and her and silent Nathan, another name from the past, they got married. Uh, finally this past,

12:38.480 --> 12:43.200
I say finally, but yeah, uh, this past week. So congratulations and our well wishes to them. And

12:43.200 --> 12:46.480
I'm sure many of the listeners, uh, especially the old school ones. And they hear those names

12:46.480 --> 12:50.800
will be excited to hear that the guy hitched. Well, guess what? Princess Irene went on a

12:50.800 --> 12:56.080
honeymoon to Japan. Perfect nerd honeymoon with her new husband, right? Man. I'm jealous. I know,

12:56.080 --> 13:00.800
right. I'm kind of jealous too. So they went to Japan and, uh, she actually asked me, she said,

13:00.800 --> 13:05.600
Hey Rob, remember a long time ago, you said I could borrow your 3DS to play animal crossing

13:05.600 --> 13:09.680
at some point. She's like, would it be possible to do that now? Because I got a 12 hour flight

13:09.680 --> 13:14.640
to Japan and that would be a great way to pass the time. And I said, Oh, sure. So, uh, she came

13:14.640 --> 13:18.800
over Wednesday night. We caught up a little bit. I gave her my 3DS and on she went well,

13:18.800 --> 13:25.200
by the time she got married and was on her way out the door, I realized, Oh crap, Pokemon X and Y is

13:25.200 --> 13:31.520
on Saturday. And I just loaned my 3DS to my friend. Is this your excuse to get an XL? Well,

13:32.400 --> 13:35.200
if your name was Shane and I don't know if he's out there listening,

13:35.200 --> 13:39.520
Shane, the salesman is currently trying to convince me that the best life choice for me

13:39.520 --> 13:46.800
would be to buy a Pokemon branded 3DS XL or 2DS. He actually said, yeah, 2DS would be a good idea

13:46.800 --> 13:52.880
too. And I'm like, Shane, that's money. That's like 180 bucks. If we were talking like 20 bucks,

13:52.880 --> 13:58.160
maybe, but that's like a whole nother system. So I'm currently having to sit and wait and I'm

13:58.160 --> 14:03.600
missing the Pokemon boat because I loaned out my 3DS. Now, look, I don't regret it because Irene,

14:03.600 --> 14:07.680
obviously love her to bits. And I, if I can bring a little more entertainment,

14:07.680 --> 14:11.200
tame it to her honeymoon, then, then so be it. But it's just kind of one of those things where

14:11.200 --> 14:17.280
I was like, don't that's too bad, but you know what? You can turn this upside or turn this back

14:17.280 --> 14:24.800
around because the grand theft auto five ship has made port and guess what? It's available right now

14:24.800 --> 14:31.440
for you to go get and play. So, so salesman Loki is going to counter salesman Shane by saying, Hey,

14:31.440 --> 14:36.800
do you know for a third of the price of the 3DS, you could be playing grand theft auto five in the

14:36.800 --> 14:43.120
vog club right now, right? What you could go the free route and play borderlands two with me play

14:43.120 --> 14:49.840
the games I already have, right? Yeah. How about being frugal? Let's hear it for fiscal responsibility.

14:51.360 --> 14:55.440
All right. Go into our chat room for some comments at live.vognetwork.com.

14:55.440 --> 15:01.040
Bobby Black Wolf says Irene deserves your 3DS more than you deserve Pokemon. Hey, shut up.

15:01.680 --> 15:06.080
Alpha Kinanagram says sky. Maybe she'll get you some Japanese street passes.

15:06.080 --> 15:09.840
I actually told her because if there weren't chargers on the plane, I told her to turn the

15:09.840 --> 15:15.440
wifi off. So that way, uh, she would save battery power would probably be the smart thing to do.

15:15.440 --> 15:20.320
Do they even have the same plugs in Japan that we have here? So she's going to be in for a rude

15:20.320 --> 15:26.640
awakening when she gets off the plane. Um, two prong. Yes. Oh really? Okay. Yeah. Two prongs

15:26.640 --> 15:32.320
will work. They just don't have the grounded. Oh yeah. Well, okay. We have Japanese PlayStation

15:32.880 --> 15:36.240
twos, Rob. Oh, that's true. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I don't have a Japanese dreamcast.

15:38.400 --> 15:42.240
If you haven't learned in the past 11 and a half years, sometimes things come out of my mouth

15:42.240 --> 15:47.760
before I really think them through dark soccer. The one who had to have the, uh, the, uh, mod,

15:47.760 --> 15:54.400
the little, uh, um, plug mod was Jessica because of her APS too.

15:54.400 --> 15:58.720
Oh, okay. I had the different plug on it. Gotcha. Bobby, I would totally have played

15:58.800 --> 16:03.760
Borderlands two with you. I have had my character ready to go for the longest time and no one's been

16:03.760 --> 16:07.920
playing. Well, I was going to say, uh, in the chat room at live.vog network.com, there's several

16:07.920 --> 16:11.760
people. Black Wolf is saying, play Borderlands two with me, play Borderlands two with me,

16:11.760 --> 16:17.680
dark soccer and Loki. Uh, game grew says, meanwhile, Irene is playing Pokemon in Japan.

16:17.680 --> 16:21.440
Uh, no, she's playing animal crossing. I know that, uh, dungeon buster says I'll play Borderlands

16:21.440 --> 16:26.640
two with you. So, uh, it looks like you might've started, uh, a Borderlands two game night in our

16:26.640 --> 16:31.600
chat room, dark soccer, a way to go. So I'm curious, do you guys have any nightmare stories

16:31.600 --> 16:36.000
or maybe good stories about loaning things out? Uh, dark soccer, you guys have the game vault.

16:36.000 --> 16:39.920
Surely you guys loan stuff out all the time. Well, I, for some reason I can't find my first

16:39.920 --> 16:43.360
bus to move soundtrack and I hope I didn't lend that out. Cause I don't think I would have loaned

16:43.360 --> 16:48.160
that out. Um, I don't know. Usually it works the other way around. People loan me stuff and then

16:48.160 --> 16:53.680
they move or I move. Or you keep their stuff forever. Like my dance pad that you had for

16:53.760 --> 16:58.240
like a year. It's fine. If I really missed it, I would ask for it back. Well, it's like,

16:58.240 --> 17:03.920
it's how I got my copy of Corona trigger. My friend loaned it to me. He moved to a Spanish

17:03.920 --> 17:09.040
Fort and then I moved to California. Oops. He hasn't asked for it back. So it's fine.

17:09.040 --> 17:13.840
Didn't you save file is still on there. Didn't you get your Saturn copy of symphony of the night

17:13.840 --> 17:18.240
through some type of game trade? No, I thought that we bought that shit. I thought it was

17:18.240 --> 17:21.280
something with like a friend of yours owed you money. And that was what she gave you.

17:21.280 --> 17:28.160
That was Dracula X. Oh, that was close. Close. My friend Krista who lives in Nagoya.

17:29.360 --> 17:33.280
She loves her now, but she used to live in Berkeley. We went to anime expo. She

17:33.280 --> 17:37.280
owed us a hundred bucks for her part of the room in the trip. Oh, okay. It was an exchange. She

17:37.280 --> 17:43.440
went to Japan to go visit her family. Came back with Dracula X for us. She already had two copies.

17:43.440 --> 17:47.920
Got it. Okay. I thought that was like a loaning story. Okay. But that was the exchange for

17:47.920 --> 17:52.480
convention space. I gotcha. Trade for goods. Oh, I loan out my games all the time and I forget

17:52.480 --> 17:57.040
people forget. I loan people stuff. So right now I don't think I have anything loaned out, but

17:58.320 --> 18:02.000
I could very well. Oh, what? Okay. Oh, I have another hilarious loaning, somebody,

18:02.000 --> 18:06.640
a game story. Okay. So, uh, Flaco Jones, I think it was, and I'm sorry if I'm calling you out and

18:06.640 --> 18:11.680
it wasn't really you. I loaned him a copy of silent Hill for the room on X-Box. At least I

18:11.680 --> 18:17.680
think it was him. And it got passed back to what I knew you had it for forever. I had it for a while.

18:17.760 --> 18:21.680
And then I loaned it to, I think it was flog. It might've been extra for though. It was one

18:21.680 --> 18:26.880
of them. And they gave it back to Irene because they were like, well, Irene's going to see you

18:26.880 --> 18:32.560
next before I do. And so funny enough, when's the next time I see Irene when we're all at a party

18:33.280 --> 18:37.840
and then. They give me the game back and I'm like, yay, here's my game back. I can go take

18:37.840 --> 18:42.160
this home and not play it. Cause like my original X-Box is like in storage at this point. I don't

18:42.160 --> 18:46.160
even, I mean, I guess it's backwards compatible on three 60, but let's be real. I don't have

18:46.160 --> 18:50.480
like an anchoring to play silent Hill for the room anytime soon. So what did I do guys?

18:51.360 --> 19:00.160
I left the game at the party. I didn't even bring it home. I'm pretty sure that game has been sold

19:00.160 --> 19:04.320
by this point. So it's just funny. You can borrow mine. If everyone play it

19:04.960 --> 19:08.960
now that I actually have it. I don't really like, like if I was going to go back and play

19:08.960 --> 19:14.240
a silent Hill game, I think I'd go play two or three. I loaned actually my three to my friend

19:14.240 --> 19:20.480
Carly. You remember you met Carly, haven't you? The one who says the best rendition of the sea

19:20.480 --> 19:27.760
bomb ever. Oh my, she makes it sound like it's poetry, but, um, at any rate, she had my silent

19:27.760 --> 19:34.000
Hill three for a long time. And I think I have it back. I don't know. Yeah. Usually it's people

19:34.000 --> 19:39.520
that I will, Julie has borrowed stuff of mine and never given it back. And then she'll say,

19:39.520 --> 19:42.720
Oh, that was mine. I bought that. No, that was not yours. Here's the receipt.

19:42.720 --> 19:46.400
I like that. You're calling people out here on the show. She's not listening though. Right?

19:46.400 --> 19:50.560
No, she's not listening. She's too busy playing fantasy star universe,

19:50.560 --> 19:54.240
which I think she's like the one person who's probably playing PSO too now. Oh yeah. Oh,

19:54.240 --> 20:00.240
everybody's moved on. That's right. I need to start playing again. Sounds good. All right.

20:00.800 --> 20:04.240
Let's go ahead and move into our gaming weeks, at least here for just a little bit. We'll talk

20:04.240 --> 20:07.920
about our gaming weeks. So we are going to get interrupted though, by the live interview here

20:07.920 --> 20:12.400
with Mike from the retro magazine Kickstarter here in just a minute, but we'll start with our

20:12.400 --> 20:16.640
gaming week. So at least get dark soccer. Okay. Well, um, I played mass effect three

20:16.640 --> 20:21.360
because Tara started playing mass effect and I was like, Oh, mass effect. So I started playing

20:21.360 --> 20:27.920
and spent more time screen capping than playing the game. And then, um, I, uh, I played animal

20:27.920 --> 20:32.240
crossing. I played a lot of animal crossing cause I'm trying to get my tan back and, um,

20:33.680 --> 20:37.520
I played fractal and I played final fantasy 14, which I want us to play at the same time.

20:37.680 --> 20:45.520
Second run dungeons. And then, um, uh, a lot, a lot of, um, be jeweled on my phone,

20:46.160 --> 20:51.600
on your phone, the blitz version where you try to do it. I play the stupid butterfly mode and

20:51.600 --> 20:56.320
diamond mine mode because I don't, I'm so out of the loop. It's actually really cool. Cause it

20:56.320 --> 21:01.120
requires a real strategy. When you play, it's basically your, your butterflies have different

21:01.120 --> 21:05.280
colors and you have to line them up. But every time you line up something else, the butterflies

21:05.280 --> 21:09.200
move up a level and there's a spider at the top waiting to pick them up. So you have to keep all

21:09.200 --> 21:13.280
these butterflies from reaching the top and at the same time making your lines and doing them.

21:13.280 --> 21:18.720
So you have no time limit, but you have to think carefully. Okay. All right. Uh, is that it for

21:18.720 --> 21:23.120
your gaming week? Yes. All right. Well, before we get to Loki's gaming week, we're going to cut in

21:23.120 --> 21:28.960
here cause it's about that time. Uh, we are going to go to the phones right now and talk to Mike

21:28.960 --> 21:36.720
Kennedy. He is with retro, which is a Kickstarter that's going on right now for a throwback video

21:36.720 --> 21:42.160
game magazine as in like a print magazine. And uh, let's see if we get him on the line. Hi Mike,

21:42.160 --> 21:46.480
you there? I'm here. How's it going? Good. Welcome to orange launch radio. How are you?

21:46.480 --> 21:51.120
I'm doing great. Thanks for having me on. No problem whatsoever. So tell us a little bit

21:51.120 --> 21:54.880
about your Kickstarter. You're behind this Kickstarter for a new magazine retro, right?

21:55.440 --> 21:59.520
Yeah. Yeah. This is something that, uh, has come about pretty quick. Um, I've actually had

21:59.520 --> 22:04.640
the idea of adding content to a gaming auction site that I've run called game gavel for about,

22:04.640 --> 22:09.600
I don't know, maybe two years now. And, uh, we originally, uh, we're bringing on some writers

22:09.600 --> 22:14.400
and we were doing, you know, just online content, uh, kind of, uh, kind of an editorial side of the

22:14.400 --> 22:18.000
website. And then one of my writers said, Mike, have you ever thought about doing a,

22:18.000 --> 22:21.520
a digital magazine? And I thought, well, hell no, I've never really thought about doing a

22:21.520 --> 22:26.960
digital magazine. Um, only because I'm, I've never, I mean, personally, I don't have digital

22:26.960 --> 22:32.080
magazines on my iPad. Um, and I don't know how many people really do. Um, but we're hoping

22:32.080 --> 22:36.080
obviously that, that, you know, it's something that people are doing more and more of. Um,

22:36.080 --> 22:40.160
but then I got the idea after hooking up with another guy, uh, Mark Kaminsky,

22:40.160 --> 22:44.160
who's our layout and design guy. Uh, he said, let's go for it. Let's just, you know, let's just,

22:44.160 --> 22:49.760
let's do a boat. Let's do a print and digital. And, uh, this was maybe two and a half weeks ago,

22:49.760 --> 22:55.920
maybe three, three weeks ago, tops. And since he's come on board, um, you know, he works for

22:55.920 --> 22:59.840
just this really large media company and, and, uh, he does, uh, you know, magazine layout and

22:59.840 --> 23:05.440
design for tons of other magazines. And he basically, uh, wanted to, um, contribute to

23:05.440 --> 23:11.360
the project and, uh, you know, just basically came on board and has just really, um, uh, I just have

23:11.360 --> 23:15.200
to say kicked ass because I mean, he does, he designed that video for us that we're using on

23:15.200 --> 23:20.880
the Kickstarter page. Uh, you know, he designed a kind of a preview layout of the magazine and

23:20.880 --> 23:26.000
he's just kind of done this all really, really fast. So he was sort of the missing link in,

23:26.000 --> 23:30.800
in the idea of doing, uh, whether it was a digital or print magazine. So, um, so sorry,

23:30.800 --> 23:35.600
this whole idea is only about three weeks old with the magazine only about three weeks. Yeah.

23:35.600 --> 23:40.080
So in a really short amount of time, uh, I guess I can tell everybody a little bit about, uh,

23:40.080 --> 23:46.080
the magazine first is, is, um, I've always had this idea of kind of going out and recruiting

23:46.080 --> 23:52.640
some of the best writers in the industry and, you know, not only, uh, writers from, you know,

23:52.640 --> 23:57.840
maybe the past maybe five to 10 years, but going back and really digging deep into the history of

23:57.840 --> 24:02.000
video game journalism and going out and just kind of recruiting, uh, right now we've got over three

24:02.000 --> 24:07.600
decades of video game journalists. So no matter, you know, when anybody kind of grew up gaming or

24:07.600 --> 24:11.920
what your decade of gaming was, whether it was the late seventies, early to mid eighties,

24:11.920 --> 24:16.240
the nineties, or today, you're probably going to recognize some of the contributors that we're

24:16.240 --> 24:20.720
going to have on the magazine. So I had to assemble this team really in about a week's time.

24:20.720 --> 24:25.200
You know, um, I called Jeremy parish and I get Jeremy, you know, gave me tons and tons of great

24:25.200 --> 24:30.160
information about, uh, you know, uh, compensation, you know, in this day and age and, and what you

24:30.160 --> 24:35.360
kind of need to pay. Right. And, um, you know, kind of, uh, and I've got quite a few connections

24:36.160 --> 24:40.960
in the industry already, uh, just running game gavel for the last six years and kind of living

24:40.960 --> 24:45.200
in Southern California, kind of the hotbed of, of developer and publisher activity. I got a lot

24:45.200 --> 24:49.520
of friends in the develop, you know, that are developers and, and, uh, publishing executives

24:49.520 --> 24:55.200
and stuff like that. So, um, it just sort of, the, the plans just sort of aligned very quickly

24:55.200 --> 24:59.680
on this thing. And I wasn't able to assemble, uh, pretty much kind of a who's who of gaming

24:59.680 --> 25:03.920
journalists to bring them in on this and, and lo and behold, everybody thought it was a great idea.

25:03.920 --> 25:08.560
Um, in fact, a lot of them said that they've all had ideas for doing something like this,

25:09.200 --> 25:12.720
um, but just never, but never done it yet. So it's kind of one of those, like, it almost

25:12.720 --> 25:17.520
sounds like it's like a, um, I don't know, like, uh, uh, uh, they bring in everything together,

25:17.520 --> 25:23.840
like the Voltron or something of, of this, this, uh, people, uh, these writers. And, um, I, I,

25:23.840 --> 25:27.040
that's why I expressed surprise a minute ago is that, wow, this thing's only three weeks old

25:27.040 --> 25:30.960
because, you know, you go over to the Kickstarter page and I'm scrolling and scrolling and scrolling

25:31.760 --> 25:35.280
and it's, you know, this big list of people. And I'm like, wow, you got, you got your little team

25:35.280 --> 25:39.840
America together at well team worldwide really together in like three weeks. That's, that's

25:39.840 --> 25:43.520
pretty, I didn't really make it through the bottom of the page because I stopped to look at Sean

25:43.520 --> 25:48.640
baby's hair. I was just like, what is going on there? I don't understand this. I don't either.

25:48.640 --> 25:52.320
You know, I met him for the first time. We were at the Portland retro gaming expo last weekend

25:52.320 --> 25:57.760
and, um, he was up there and we've been talking on the phone a lot and, uh, but yeah, he's basically,

25:57.920 --> 26:01.760
that's pretty much it, you know, and I think he'll, uh, sometimes it's that little Mohawk's

26:01.760 --> 26:06.560
green and fluorescent green. Sometimes it's orange, pink or red. I'm very jealous of him

26:06.560 --> 26:09.840
that it's not falling out because when you dye your hair that much, that's what's supposed to

26:09.840 --> 26:13.200
be happening. But anyway, if you guys have a question for Mike, uh, with retro magazine,

26:13.200 --> 26:18.880
Kickstarter, you can ask that live here in our chat room, live.vog network.com dark soccer.

26:18.880 --> 26:22.480
I know you're dying to say something here because you've been studying print for awhile. This has to

26:22.480 --> 26:27.360
be tickling you this whole idea, right? Well, you had me at print. I love the smell of CMYK fumes in

26:27.360 --> 26:34.320
the morning. That's right. Um, I actually am a print designer and I, and I actually have just

26:34.320 --> 26:42.400
recently gone into contract writing as in writing by contract. Yes I have. So, um, I, I find the

26:42.400 --> 26:48.320
whole thing just very fascinating. I was wondering though, um, where you happen to get other, uh,

26:48.320 --> 26:52.720
bits of inspiration from, cause I know that in the UK there's retro gamer right now and

26:53.120 --> 26:58.160
yep. Yeah, no, that's a great magazine. I mean if, if, you know, if we can put together,

26:58.160 --> 27:02.320
you know, something half as good as that, I'd be, you know, I love it. I mean that,

27:02.960 --> 27:08.480
the thing that's so great about their magazine is they pack so much into it and they, they throw it

27:08.480 --> 27:13.680
all together. Um, and like every spread, every like, you know, two page spread will have like

27:13.680 --> 27:18.000
10 different stories going on, but yet they make it work. You know what I mean? And every time you

27:18.000 --> 27:21.680
read that magazine, you see something new. It doesn't matter how many times you pick it up

27:21.680 --> 27:24.400
or you know how old the magazine is. I mean you're reading through it and you're like,

27:24.400 --> 27:28.640
God, I don't remember reading this, you know, the other 20 times I've flipped through the pages,

27:28.640 --> 27:32.960
you know, their design is so clever. So I've, I was thinking, you know, I've thought for a

27:32.960 --> 27:37.440
while that we could use something like that, you know, geared toward a North American audience

27:37.440 --> 27:41.680
because some of the machines they cover over there, we never got out over here, but are you

27:41.680 --> 27:46.400
also planning on including like some of the old import market, you know? Yeah, I tell you what,

27:46.400 --> 27:52.560
it's since we've launched the Kickstarter campaign, we have had, uh, some great writers

27:52.560 --> 27:57.840
from around the world contact us and want to be a part of this. Um, also in the U S I mean,

27:57.840 --> 28:03.200
that's why this list keeps growing. I mean, when I first started out with this, I had,

28:03.200 --> 28:10.320
uh, like Jeremy, uh, Sean, uh, cat. Um, you know, we went after Bob Mackie. Uh, of course he, he,

28:10.320 --> 28:13.920
uh, the doors open to him, but he had some other things that, that, that might get in the way you

28:13.920 --> 28:18.400
thought. Um, and a few others. So I had like maybe, maybe 10 to 12 people. And I think now

28:18.400 --> 28:23.600
we've grown to like over 20 because people just want to be a part of this. And it's almost like,

28:23.600 --> 28:28.000
you know, uh, they're not doing it for the money of course, because right now it's so segment,

28:28.000 --> 28:31.840
we have so many people, it's not like in each, any one of them is going to be, you know, submitting

28:31.840 --> 28:35.840
so many things. A lot of these people are going to be submitting, you know, maybe one or two columns,

28:35.840 --> 28:40.480
um, that are recurring. Um, while we have others that might do, you know, a feature article,

28:40.480 --> 28:44.160
an interview if we want them to do that, you know, or some assignment type, some assignment

28:44.160 --> 28:48.960
type work. But, but yeah, the, to, to answer the question, we've had, uh, a couple of folks in

28:48.960 --> 28:54.240
Japan, uh, send me some of their work and their journalists and podcasters over there. Uh, we've

28:54.240 --> 29:00.000
had, uh, someone in the UK, we had somebody in Germany and, um, the deal is, I mean, I'm,

29:00.000 --> 29:05.200
I'm basically, um, we'd love to have import information in here, whether it's current gen or,

29:05.200 --> 29:09.120
you know, retro and classic information, because I mean, those areas had huge, you know, huge

29:09.120 --> 29:14.320
influences, uh, even on the gaming here in the United States. Um, and it's sort of like,

29:14.320 --> 29:17.920
you know, I mean, uh, I don't know what your first introduction was kind of to Japanese gaming,

29:17.920 --> 29:22.480
but like the turbo graphics for me when I was little was sort of that strange, you know,

29:22.480 --> 29:28.240
kind of mystical game, you know, console that, you know, played Japanese games. And, um, you know,

29:28.240 --> 29:32.640
and then I guess the Neo Geo kind of came in and, you know, uh, I guess maybe right after that,

29:32.640 --> 29:36.160
or pretty cool, pretty damn near about the same time, I guess. But, you know, it was always just

29:36.160 --> 29:40.560
weird and seeing these games, um, you know, it was, it was just totally, you know, mind blowing

29:40.560 --> 29:43.680
to see what they were doing over there. So there's some great history there and we really want to

29:43.680 --> 29:47.600
cover all of the bases in retro. I mean, uh, you know, all the bases. So that personally makes me

29:47.600 --> 29:51.600
happy. I guess you could, uh, could, uh, imagine my, uh, delight when I married someone who had

29:51.600 --> 29:58.000
a turbo duo and a Neo Geo. Oh yeah. Um, I always like to ask this question of, uh, Kickstarter folks

29:58.000 --> 30:02.800
when they come on the show, uh, you have this Kickstarter behind the campaign. I think it's

30:02.800 --> 30:06.080
kind of obvious that, you know, the money is probably being raised because you actually have

30:06.080 --> 30:10.400
to print the magazine that doesn't come for free, but what is it you're specifically raising the

30:10.400 --> 30:14.960
money to do in this process? Well, mainly actually paying the writers, you know, these guys don't

30:14.960 --> 30:22.160
come cheap and, uh, you know, my original budget was, uh, about six grand per issue, you know,

30:22.160 --> 30:27.040
and if we got six issues, there's 36 grand right there. Right. Right. Um, and then of course we do

30:27.040 --> 30:31.120
have printing costs now, Mark being in the industry, you know, uh, Mark commits my layout

30:31.120 --> 30:35.440
and design guy, he's got some great contacts and we've really got our printing costs, uh,

30:35.440 --> 30:39.920
in check. I mean, we've got them way low, even if we could even get up to, and this is sort of

30:39.920 --> 30:45.200
maybe a lofty goal right now, but over 10,000, a total of 10,000 per issues, it drops down to

30:45.200 --> 30:51.520
about, uh, about 90 cents an issue or a print. And that's, uh, you know, 50 right now we're,

30:51.520 --> 30:55.680
we're, we're going to, it's going to be a minimum of 52 pages, a high gloss page, and we're gonna

30:55.680 --> 31:00.240
do a thick stock cover. Do you guys remember like a next generation magazine? Yeah. Yeah. I mean,

31:00.240 --> 31:04.720
one of the last greatest magazines, uh, at least as far as I'm concerned, you know, and they always

31:04.720 --> 31:08.800
had that thick cover and I've still got, you know, I think the first two years, uh, even at their

31:08.800 --> 31:13.520
premiere issue, uh, up, up in my closet because I just can't throw them away. They're just too nice

31:13.520 --> 31:17.200
and they're a resource. You know, they had lots of, uh, you know, it was kind of that first

31:17.200 --> 31:21.200
magazine that was kind of geared more towards, uh, I'm not gonna say adults, but I mean,

31:21.200 --> 31:25.920
older gamers kind of at the time. And it's just full of great information. The covers were so

31:25.920 --> 31:29.840
high quality is like, it wasn't a magazine you just read and throw in the trash. I don't think.

31:29.840 --> 31:34.160
And that's what we want to do. We want to do, you know, uh, kind of a thick stock cover. Um,

31:34.720 --> 31:39.360
you know, and, uh, just, just something that's going to kind of be a resource and, uh, Mark,

31:39.360 --> 31:42.560
you know, being the great guy is, you know, we're, we're, we put an update in there about,

31:42.560 --> 31:46.480
you know, using environmentally conscious, you know, materials and everything, soy inks and,

31:46.480 --> 31:50.560
and recyclable paper. But the thing is going to look beautiful. Um, but I mean,

31:50.560 --> 31:55.360
those are all things that we're thinking about. Um, and, you know, thanks to Mark, you know,

31:55.360 --> 31:59.760
for kind of coming on and being in the industry and kind of knowing where to go, uh, and, and

31:59.760 --> 32:03.200
putting this whole thing together. He, the magazine is going to look as good as anything

32:03.200 --> 32:06.160
you've ever seen. I can guarantee you that with him on board this thing. Well, I think there's

32:06.160 --> 32:09.680
a lot of people out there that definitely kind of collected these sort of game magazines and

32:09.680 --> 32:14.640
are probably really looking for something like this. Um, I know that, uh, part of the approach,

32:14.640 --> 32:18.160
at least that I was getting from the Kickstarter page is that you don't necessarily want these

32:18.160 --> 32:22.560
issues to feel dated. I know the Kickstarter page says, you're not really looking at covering the

32:22.560 --> 32:27.440
current in gaming. Just because you call it retro doesn't mean it's retro only, but I'm getting the

32:27.440 --> 32:32.800
sense that you want these magazines to have to not be dated or, or stuck to a certain month and year,

32:32.800 --> 32:36.560
right? Yeah. Well, for sure. I mean, every magazine is going to cover everything. It's

32:36.560 --> 32:41.520
going to be heavily weighted with retro, of course. Um, certainly any current generation games or, or,

32:41.520 --> 32:46.160
or gaming, you know, topics that have some sort of a historical background or relevance, uh, we want

32:46.160 --> 32:50.000
to talk about, um, you know, we're kind of going back and forth. That's not to say we won't, you

32:50.000 --> 32:55.440
know, uh, review AAA titles, but I mean, what's the point of reviewing, you know, Call of Duty 12

32:55.440 --> 32:59.040
of if every other magazine and every other website's already doing it, you know what I mean?

32:59.040 --> 33:04.480
And so, you know, like I said, you may or may not see those types of, those types of things, you

33:04.480 --> 33:08.000
know, uh, reviewed, you know, typically we're going to hopefully look for stuff that kind of

33:08.000 --> 33:12.240
flies under the radar. Certainly the indie stuff is big right now and there's tons of innovation

33:12.240 --> 33:17.680
there, even, you know, on the retro side and mobile, you know? Um, so you can expect console,

33:17.680 --> 33:22.400
mobile, indie, uh, PC gaming, arcade and pinball. We got Kevin Steele in there from

33:22.400 --> 33:27.120
Game Room Magazine going to bring up that end of it. Um, you know, we're going to cover it all,

33:27.120 --> 33:31.200
you know, we're going to try to fit it into 52 pages. I'm thinking there's probably a

33:31.200 --> 33:35.360
relatively good chance that this thing's going to increase to 60 pages, uh, when we start.

33:35.360 --> 33:38.240
Well, that's one of your stretch goals, right? Is to try and thicken the magazine?

33:38.240 --> 33:41.520
Yeah, yeah. We didn't really, that's one of the things we've been a little bit criticized over

33:41.520 --> 33:45.680
kind of the, kind of the ambiguity behind the stretch goals. And right now, um, you know,

33:45.680 --> 33:49.920
we don't really know, we know it's going to be a minimum of 52 pages and only four pages of ads.

33:49.920 --> 33:54.240
So we want to keep it, you know, uh, lots of, you know, lots of in-depth features and stuff and

33:54.240 --> 34:00.160
minimal on the ad space. Um, but you know, right now we've got so many people, uh, the, the trick

34:00.160 --> 34:04.400
for us is going to be, you know, how do we juggle everybody? Is everybody in every issue? Uh, are

34:04.400 --> 34:08.880
some people staggered, you know, every other issue, um, or do we just simply add more pages? And

34:08.880 --> 34:13.120
honestly, that's what we'd want to do. Um, and I think we get up, you know, if we can get up over,

34:13.120 --> 34:17.600
you know, to the sixties, you know, uh, our goal is 50,000, which really is what we've budgeted

34:17.600 --> 34:23.840
as sort of a breakeven point to produce six 52 page issues. So if we can go, um, you know,

34:23.840 --> 34:27.520
if we can get up to 60, 70,000, we'd like to add, you know, another four pages, you know,

34:27.520 --> 34:32.000
four page increments, of course. Um, we get up to 60 pages and, and, uh, you know, maybe you get

34:32.000 --> 34:37.440
into the 80 to 90 page range maybe before the year is over. Um, we've, we've got, I mean, we're,

34:37.440 --> 34:42.240
there will be no shortage of content. I'll tell you that, um, these guys are already, you know,

34:42.240 --> 34:46.080
coming up with some great ideas, uh, things they're going to be writing about. And I'm just

34:46.080 --> 34:50.240
as excited as everybody else, uh, to be reading what all these people have to say. You're just

34:50.240 --> 34:54.560
putting this all together. You can't wait to read it yourself. I can't. Yeah, I really can't. I've

34:54.560 --> 34:58.400
been reading, you know, I mean, I grew up gaming in the seventies and, and, you know, electronic

34:58.400 --> 35:03.440
games, the first kind of magazine dedicated to the hobby, um, you know, back in the early eighties,

35:03.440 --> 35:10.480
um, and, um, you know, graduated into, you know, game fan and EGM and, and, uh, game pro like

35:10.480 --> 35:14.240
everybody else did. You remember when game magazines used to be like 200 pages thick.

35:14.240 --> 35:17.760
I do. You know, I mean, those, those were the days. I mean, those were just great days.

35:17.760 --> 35:23.120
I also, I was really fond of, um, my first gaming system and I'm using my quotey fingers was really

35:23.120 --> 35:27.440
a Commodore 64. So I remember, I remember the magazines that were like the really nice glossy

35:27.440 --> 35:31.520
pages at the beginning and the back was more like newspaper. Cause it was all the type these into

35:31.520 --> 35:35.440
your computer. Yeah. Right. Get these games type of thing. Yeah. I've got a Commodore 64 set up

35:35.440 --> 35:40.560
here in the home arcade. Yeah. I mean, it's, you know, I collect, you know, that's part of the

35:40.560 --> 35:44.560
reason I started game gavel, the auction site back in away, which is to give gamers a better place to

35:44.560 --> 35:48.240
buy and sell. It's a lot cheaper than eBay, free listings, free seller stores. We've got tons of

35:48.240 --> 35:53.040
great sellers on there. Um, and, uh, the plan. Um, and, and we're not going to bombard people

35:53.040 --> 35:56.800
with game gavel in the magazine, but on the digital side, uh, well, first of all, if everybody

35:56.800 --> 36:00.160
that buys the print subscription is going to get digital for free. Okay. So you're going to be able

36:00.160 --> 36:05.920
to kind of get both. Um, the digital magazines, we will have, uh, maybe just a shopping cart icon.

36:05.920 --> 36:09.120
So if you're reading about a game, you know, we'll put a shopping cart on there. If you click

36:09.120 --> 36:12.960
the shopping cart, it'll pull up the listings and the auction site for all of the other gamers that

36:12.960 --> 36:17.360
are, that are, that are selling that game, you know, and bringing people into the marketplace

36:17.360 --> 36:22.080
to buy and sell. So that's kind of the plan, kind of integrating the commerce with the content,

36:22.080 --> 36:25.440
at least with the digital. I was gonna say a little bit of synergy between your, your different

36:25.440 --> 36:29.120
projects, but that's smart. I mean, there's nothing wrong with that. Uh, if you guys want

36:29.120 --> 36:33.520
to consider donating to a retro, the throwback video game magazine, you can find that on

36:33.520 --> 36:38.480
Kickstarter. It's a kickstarter.com slash projects slash. So Cal Mike, but it's probably easier to

36:38.480 --> 36:43.760
just go to kickstarter.com and search for retro. Uh, some of the different various award tiers,

36:43.760 --> 36:48.880
you can actually get, uh, for $7, the premiere issue of retro. If you want to look at a six

36:48.880 --> 36:55.920
years, uh, one or six issue, excuse me, one year digital subscription, uh, you can kick back $12

36:56.000 --> 36:59.520
for that, uh, dark soccer, very reasonable. Yeah. You had something dark soccer. Well,

36:59.520 --> 37:06.480
you said you said the magic P word pinball. Yeah. So, um, that actually really, uh,

37:06.480 --> 37:10.400
my husband and I collect pinball tables. Oh, right. And, um, we're down to three,

37:11.600 --> 37:15.200
but we have a twilight zone. So that's what matters. What else do you guys have? Um,

37:15.200 --> 37:20.800
we have world cup soccer 94, which was my favorite and, uh, jackpot. Oh, right. Yeah.

37:20.800 --> 37:26.560
We actually got rid of no fear for jackpot, but, um, it was like, I know we actually have

37:26.560 --> 37:31.280
hung out a few times with, uh, Steve Ritchie. Um, yeah, we know Steve. He's such a great guy.

37:31.280 --> 37:36.800
Oh yeah. Uh, and he does the voices. That's so amazing. But, um, I was asking what I was

37:36.800 --> 37:40.640
wondering about the pinball is if you were going to be, um, like doing interviews with stern and,

37:40.640 --> 37:45.440
and covering some of the newer, uh, yeah. I mean, I, I mean, I know the stern, I noticed,

37:45.440 --> 37:49.520
um, you know, we know stern real well. We know Jersey Jack real well. Um, you know,

37:49.520 --> 37:52.960
they just came out with wizard of Oz and they're working, I think on their second table now.

37:52.960 --> 37:56.640
Um, so yeah, I mean, anytime there's a new table out, we want to do, you know,

37:56.640 --> 38:00.400
an in-depth review of that thing and, and, uh, you know, interview the designers behind it.

38:00.400 --> 38:04.080
Uh, we just, uh, we've got great, you know, again, I've just got some great, uh,

38:04.080 --> 38:09.200
great contacts going back, uh, um, you know, through, through the years and everything. And,

38:09.200 --> 38:14.240
and, uh, we do, um, retro gaming round up podcast for about six years and every one of those shows,

38:14.240 --> 38:19.200
we do a one to two hour interview with somebody, um, you know, famous, some old gaming, you know,

38:20.080 --> 38:24.560
we did Al Alcorn and Ted Dabney, all the Activision guys, uh, Steve, I mean, uh,

38:24.560 --> 38:28.880
some of the pinball folks. I mean, it, it goes on and on and on. We get all of our interviews

38:28.880 --> 38:32.720
at classic gaming expo and Portland and the Portland show. We just went to, we got some

38:32.720 --> 38:36.960
great interviews up there. Um, and a lot of those interviews can be transcribed into the

38:36.960 --> 38:41.280
magazine as well. Just kind of preserved in print. Nice. Let me go to, let me go to chat

38:41.280 --> 38:45.680
room with a couple of questions, uh, from live.vognetwork.com. Uh, I'll ask a couple

38:45.680 --> 38:49.920
of these questions and then we'll wrap up here. Um, dark Tetsuya in our chat room says, uh,

38:49.920 --> 38:54.800
out of all the names you got involved, who were you the most excited to get on board?

38:55.760 --> 39:00.400
Um, boy, I would have to say, if I could answer too, well, I don't know. I'd have to say Jeremy

39:00.400 --> 39:05.840
parish because, you know, Jeremy is, is such a consummate professional. He's just, he's a great

39:05.840 --> 39:10.160
writer. Um, and people love Jeremy, you know, there's just something about him that, that

39:10.160 --> 39:16.240
everybody loves. Um, uh, I hate to, you know, single anybody out. I mean, Sean baby, Chris

39:16.240 --> 39:22.000
Kohler, Jeff green, uh, Andy Eddie, for God's sakes. Um, cat Bailey, Ryan Scott, Leonard Herman,

39:22.000 --> 39:26.880
a big historian in, in the, uh, in the, um, you know, in the industry that writes just these great

39:26.880 --> 39:30.560
books, you know, and, uh, what I'm excited about having Lenny on board is, is, you know, he, he

39:30.560 --> 39:35.840
writes some of them. Are you familiar with, with Lenny Herman? Uh, the name doesn't ring a bell,

39:35.840 --> 39:38.240
but it's probably one of those things when you tell me what he did. I'll be like, yes,

39:38.240 --> 39:41.840
Leonard Herman and look at the books. I mean, he writes just some of the best books on the history

39:41.840 --> 39:46.080
of gaming. And, uh, these are like, you know, five, 600 pages is a lot of times they're,

39:46.080 --> 39:49.280
they're insane. And so what I'm excited about is, is there's a lot of young general, you know,

39:49.280 --> 39:53.360
kind of the younger generation gamer who may not pick up, you know, a 500 page book on the industry

39:53.360 --> 39:58.000
and the history of it. Um, but you know, if he can write, you know, four or five, six pages on a,

39:58.000 --> 40:02.640
on a particular topic, um, you know, I think, I think kids will read it and, and really learn

40:02.640 --> 40:06.000
something about the industry. And that's what we really want to do. We want to sort of preserve the

40:06.000 --> 40:09.920
past and kind of look back and understand, you know, why the industry is what it is. I mean,

40:09.920 --> 40:13.200
God, when it started, everybody thought it was gonna be a fad. I remember back in the

40:13.200 --> 40:17.200
seventies and the eighties, you know, nobody knew it was going to be around for another 30 years.

40:17.200 --> 40:20.640
I really love reading the stories from like the time when people were developing for the

40:20.640 --> 40:24.400
Atari 2600, when it just sounded like, you know, it was so much pressure and it was like one or

40:24.400 --> 40:28.480
two people. And it's such a different type of culture than what we see now. We had two days

40:28.480 --> 40:33.520
to make Pac-Man. You know, I've, I'm always fascinated by that. And like really how it's

40:33.520 --> 40:37.120
grown into these. Now you look at a game like Grand Theft Auto five and it's like, you know,

40:37.120 --> 40:41.440
it's like shooting five movies all at the same time. It's so much. Yeah. I mean, it's,

40:41.440 --> 40:45.280
it's really insane. It's really insane. But yeah, I'd have to say Jeremy, I was really glad

40:45.280 --> 40:49.760
to get him on more, but, but not to just pick anybody. I'm, I'm just loving everybody that

40:49.760 --> 40:54.080
we've assembled into this thing so far. And, and a lot of them, you know, have asked to get involved

40:54.080 --> 40:58.160
with it after the fact. Nice. You know, which is great, which is sort of, uh, I think just

40:58.160 --> 41:02.320
led some credibility to the idea of, of, uh, you know, everybody wants to be a part of this thing

41:02.320 --> 41:07.920
and, uh, you know, getting the, getting all of this wisdom and, and history, uh, you know,

41:07.920 --> 41:12.800
it packed into the pages of a single magazine, uh, has never been done before. Even on a website,

41:12.800 --> 41:16.720
you know, there's not, there's not been a writing team like this assembled. So it's,

41:16.720 --> 41:21.680
it's just a special thing. And, um, you know, we, uh, I think we got a long way to go. I mean, we're

41:22.240 --> 41:28.800
you know, around 35% of goal right now. Uh, but you know, we got 20 days to go. That sounds like

41:28.800 --> 41:32.080
it long time, but the days kind of keep ticking away. And I keep thinking to myself, you know,

41:32.400 --> 41:35.200
the trend has kind of been down, but I've talked to people who run kickstarters. I don't know if

41:35.200 --> 41:38.880
you guys know anybody or run into yourself, but it sounds like there's a little bit of a kind of

41:38.880 --> 41:43.360
a smile or it kind of dips and goes down. And then, you know, people just wait. Cause you know,

41:43.360 --> 41:47.040
I wait a lot of times on kickstarters. I'll wait till the last few days or the last week,

41:47.040 --> 41:51.440
you know, and then, you know, there's a big kind of a surge of people kind of that last week.

41:51.440 --> 41:55.600
And so, uh, yeah, we kind of hope it goes that way. I think the internet is kind of a funky

41:55.600 --> 42:00.080
place too, where you kind of have to just catch that wave at the right moment where it hits and

42:00.080 --> 42:03.840
it goes viral and then it's spreading everywhere. And then that's where your kickstarter is really

42:03.840 --> 42:09.360
going to take off. So, um, I hope I, I, I'm not going to profess to be a very large organization

42:09.360 --> 42:13.840
here at orange launch radio, other voice geeks network, but I hope we can do what we can here

42:13.840 --> 42:17.200
by having you on tonight to bring awareness to it. Maybe, maybe cause a little bit of an uptick

42:17.200 --> 42:22.800
with that. Um, again, if you guys want to look at a retro, you can check that out at kickstarter.com

42:22.800 --> 42:27.200
and I'm also happy to spread the word around the pinball circles. Yeah, please do. I mean,

42:27.200 --> 42:31.120
we, we want to definitely have, uh, you know, some pinball, uh, uh, content in every issue,

42:31.120 --> 42:34.160
you know? Um, I think there's plenty of plenty of things to talk about.

42:35.120 --> 42:39.120
Especially with the craziness of some of the tables that have just come out and are coming

42:39.120 --> 42:44.240
out. Metallica was crazy. Have you seen Wizard of Oz? Yes, I did. I played it. Holy crap. That

42:44.240 --> 42:48.560
thing was insane. It's crazy. And there's just so much going on. I was like, I'm about to go

42:48.560 --> 42:53.760
into overload. I think I need to take a break. Yeah. It's a very impressive table. I like the

42:53.760 --> 42:58.240
Tron table. I thought that was cool, but I'm a big nerd. I like the special edition Tron.

42:58.240 --> 43:02.480
All right. Before I let Mike go, Mike, we always ask our guests this when they come on the show

43:02.480 --> 43:05.760
and it may have nothing to do with the project that you're talking about, but we are a video

43:05.760 --> 43:11.120
game show. We want to know what kind of games are you playing this week? Oh my gosh. Well,

43:11.120 --> 43:16.640
I just picked up a missile command cocktail table here on the Craigslist here in LA

43:17.520 --> 43:23.040
for a whopping $140. Super cheap for a cocktail table. That's great. Oh my gosh. I mean,

43:23.040 --> 43:26.640
everybody, I got friends all over the country and you guys are in LA, right? Or Southern

43:26.640 --> 43:31.840
California. We're in Sacramento. So we're about six hours north of you. Yeah. I drove up there.

43:31.840 --> 43:37.360
I drove to Portland and spent a night on the way up in Sac. But I don't know what it is up north,

43:37.360 --> 43:43.040
but down here, it's just sort of like a feeding friends. I mean, my friends are going nuts because

43:43.040 --> 43:47.360
I find such great deals like on Craigslist, you know, they're like missile command, 140 bucks.

43:47.360 --> 43:52.480
That would have been $500 in Virginia, you know? And so, yeah, I just picked that up

43:52.480 --> 43:57.680
and I've been playing some, what was I playing today? I think Gradius 5 on the PS2. Nice.

43:58.400 --> 44:03.600
Great game. I've got a little man cave down here, kind of home office where I've got,

44:03.600 --> 44:08.560
you know, four arcade games. I got a Touchmaster hooked up. I got an Apple IIc and my Commodore's

44:08.560 --> 44:13.920
hooked up. I got about 90 Commodore cartridges and I play that all the time. So you don't just

44:13.920 --> 44:19.840
talk the talk with this retro stuff. You walk the walk as well. Yeah, no, man. I'm in deep. Thank

44:19.840 --> 44:24.320
God my wife loves to play games as well. So that's how my husband and I got together.

44:24.320 --> 44:26.320
A last thing here, Dark Soccer, you had one more thing.

44:27.520 --> 44:34.400
I actually was just thinking of imagined if our two vaults combined, it would totally

44:34.400 --> 44:39.600
explode the world. Dark Soccer and Her Abbey have a huge gaming vault as well that just like all

44:39.600 --> 44:44.240
this stuff. So I want to go play all this stuff now, but you were actually asking about a little

44:44.240 --> 44:48.960
bit about what the market is up here. For a lot of the retro games, they're actually quite expensive

44:48.960 --> 44:53.680
and it's easy for us to go to the Bay Area too. It's not unreasonable. But especially in the

44:53.680 --> 44:58.720
pinball market, for example, our Twilight Zone about maybe five years ago, we could have gotten

44:58.720 --> 45:03.920
about three grand for it. We could easily get six. Right. Yeah. Well, that's one of the greats.

45:03.920 --> 45:09.120
Yeah. All right. Well, I got to wrap up and let Mike go. Mike, thanks so much for your time here.

45:09.120 --> 45:13.120
Thank you guys so much. I really appreciate the opportunity to tell your listeners about this.

45:13.120 --> 45:16.960
No worries. And best of luck with the project. You know, one thing I don't think I really got

45:16.960 --> 45:20.160
out there during the interview is that we love that you're taking an indie approach to it.

45:20.720 --> 45:23.280
We've always been fiercely independent here at Orange Lawn Trader. You know,

45:23.280 --> 45:26.880
we've been doing what we do here since 2002. Yeah. Amazing.

45:26.880 --> 45:30.400
Yeah. For 11 plus years. Before a podcast even was a podcast.

45:31.520 --> 45:35.360
Yes, actually. Yeah. We were a live 365 show for a couple of years before that.

45:35.360 --> 45:36.960
Oh, right. We tell all the kids to get off our lawn.

45:36.960 --> 45:41.840
But yeah, I mean, we love that you guys are keeping it independent with this. Even if

45:41.840 --> 45:46.480
you are bringing in people who are kind of paid behind the big budget stuff,

45:46.480 --> 45:50.000
you're kind of at least getting them outside of that element for this indie production.

45:50.000 --> 45:53.680
I think that's fantastic. It's great because they're going to, I think that, I mean,

45:53.680 --> 45:57.360
these guys aren't used to writing and kind of this type of environment. I think I mentioned

45:57.360 --> 46:00.640
that one of the updates that, you know, they're used to working for these big media companies

46:00.640 --> 46:05.280
all the time. And so, I'm hoping that, you know, they're on a long leash. I'll tell you that. I

46:05.280 --> 46:07.760
mean, really, they're not on any kind of a leash. I mean, I don't know what they're going to be

46:07.760 --> 46:11.840
writing about. You know, we'll obviously kind of nail some of that down as we move forward

46:11.840 --> 46:16.400
to building the first issue. But I really think that they're going to talk about things and write

46:16.400 --> 46:19.440
maybe just a little bit differently in this environment than they would normally write,

46:19.440 --> 46:23.520
you know, working for Future US or WriteGN or, you know, one of these big companies.

46:23.520 --> 46:28.640
So, I'm just really excited to kind of give them the freedom to kind of write what they want to

46:28.640 --> 46:34.560
write about, how they want to write. A new side of some of your favorite video game authors.

46:34.640 --> 46:40.320
Yeah. Hey, one last thing too. Speaking of Live 365, I also do a retroarcaderadio.com. It's just

46:40.320 --> 46:46.320
24 hours a day, live streaming, retro gaming related music and old vintage commercials.

46:47.040 --> 46:50.400
You guys are interested in that. It's been going on. I've been running that for about

46:50.400 --> 46:56.160
five or six years as well. So, retroarcaderadio.com, but it's a Live 365 station as well.

46:57.280 --> 47:01.680
Hey, they served a great purpose for us for many years until we decided to branch out. So,

47:01.680 --> 47:05.680
but yeah, that's awesome. That sounds like a great thing to do when you're playing your

47:05.680 --> 47:10.560
Commodore 64 with 90 cartridges and all this other crazy stuff you have. So, that's awesome.

47:10.560 --> 47:15.280
Well, best of luck with your various projects. That's retroarcaderadio.com?

47:15.280 --> 47:16.480
Retroarcaderadio.com.

47:16.480 --> 47:20.080
Retroarcaderadio.com. Okay. So, you got retroarcaderadio.com,

47:20.080 --> 47:25.600
gamegavel.com and soon retro game magazine or whatever domain you get for this.

47:25.600 --> 47:26.000
Yep.

47:26.000 --> 47:28.960
Dot com as well. You're a busy guy, Mike. Best of luck with all your projects.

47:28.960 --> 47:29.600
Thank you so much.

47:29.600 --> 47:32.240
Thank you for taking the time out to be with us here at OLR tonight. Have a great night.

47:32.240 --> 47:33.360
All right. Bye guys.

47:33.360 --> 47:36.640
All right. Bye-bye. Wow. That was awesome.

47:36.640 --> 47:37.840
You should be our new best friend.

47:40.400 --> 47:43.440
You want to be his best friend. No, I liked him. He seemed well enough,

47:43.440 --> 47:46.800
but you guys definitely have the retro pinball. That same same's there.

47:46.800 --> 47:48.800
Well, just a moment he said pinball is like, bing.

47:49.760 --> 47:53.680
Well, you don't get any of that in any of the current publications really,

47:53.680 --> 47:58.640
unless it's specifically pinball. And I mean, especially now with, you know,

47:59.280 --> 48:03.040
for example, that wizard of Oz table has such a heavy video element with it

48:03.760 --> 48:07.760
that, or all the pinball 2000 that had the screens.

48:08.640 --> 48:14.640
You're dealing with a pinball and video game, you know, a digital game combined

48:14.640 --> 48:17.680
that isn't baby Pac-Man. But I still love baby Pac-Man.

48:17.680 --> 48:19.840
I still love baby Pac-Man. I love me some baby Pac-Man.

48:19.840 --> 48:23.200
All right. Best of luck to those guys. One more time. You can search for that on kickstarter.com.

48:23.200 --> 48:26.720
It is retro and I'll probably contribute a little bit for that effort. I think,

48:27.280 --> 48:30.720
I think it's a fine, uh, idea they've got over there. And I would,

48:30.720 --> 48:33.440
I would not mind having some more magazines to put on the shelves.

48:33.440 --> 48:35.520
Maybe this will take my Kickstarter virginity.

48:36.080 --> 48:39.120
Ooh. Okay. That's right. You've never donated to a Kickstarter.

48:39.120 --> 48:42.400
Because my Amazon payments weren't working every time I freaking try.

48:42.400 --> 48:45.360
All right. So by the way, before we move on to the rest of our gaming weeks,

48:45.360 --> 48:48.400
I did want to point out over in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com,

48:48.400 --> 48:52.560
uh, there wasn't, uh, there was a lot of other chatter that weren't just question for

48:52.560 --> 48:57.440
questions for Mike. Uh, but there was chalk going on there about like some other gaming magazine,

48:57.440 --> 49:00.160
you know, memories. And we're going to get into that with our Fugu question of the week later,

49:00.160 --> 49:04.160
but I did want to point out for dark soccer, a code man was offering to go get high with

49:04.160 --> 49:09.200
you on some CMYK fumes. Oh yeah. I, I think I actually started that.

49:09.200 --> 49:15.600
There you go. I'm sorry. If you, if you are a print design person, there is no smell as

49:15.600 --> 49:22.640
wonderful as stepping into a print shop and smelling the toxic fumes. I have to tell you

49:22.640 --> 49:27.200
that traditional ink smells a lot different than the soy ink. And I don't know what I like better.

49:28.320 --> 49:32.480
Just saying. Have you smelled a print shop on weed?

49:34.000 --> 49:38.640
All right, Loki. Uh, it's time to get over to your gaming week. When we left off, we'd heard

49:38.640 --> 49:41.600
it from dark soccer. Let's get into your gaming week and the types of games you've been playing

49:41.600 --> 49:45.120
this week. Well, it's really only one type of game. I've been playing Grand Theft Auto five.

49:45.360 --> 49:50.720
I did play a little bit of online cause I was trying to catch up my Xbox, uh, 360 character

49:51.520 --> 49:58.560
to my PS3 character. So I managed to get up to level 10 on my 360 character. And then I decided,

49:58.560 --> 50:03.760
um, uh, well, one night I was trying to play with Bobby, but he kept getting stuck in like

50:03.760 --> 50:08.800
full games and I couldn't join his game. So I ended up just going back to single player

50:08.800 --> 50:12.000
and trying to finish my a hundred percent stuff. So that's what I've been doing since,

50:12.560 --> 50:21.920
uh, earlier this week. And I'm now 82% complete. I think I started, I'm pretty much almost done

50:21.920 --> 50:29.600
with the Epsilon program missions and, um, what else did I do? Oh, I finished all the, uh,

50:29.600 --> 50:36.640
triathlons, which seriously, rock stars, seriously. There's a 30 minute fucking long triathlon,

50:36.640 --> 50:44.080
30 minutes in real time of mashing a mashing a for 30 fucking that sounds about as awesome as

50:44.080 --> 50:50.080
desert bus. I, that is so fucking, oh, it's almost as, almost as fun as the part in Epsilon,

50:50.080 --> 50:55.520
uh, missions where you have to run for five miles. So I was sitting there running in circles for

50:55.520 --> 51:03.920
about 20 minutes that that was fun. Also mashing a for like a while. Um, and then what else? So,

51:04.240 --> 51:12.160
all the races and, um, I think I'm pretty much, I have a buying property and I don't know pretty

51:12.160 --> 51:17.600
much. I just have to do a lot of the collectibles and stunt jumps and the planes under the bridges

51:17.600 --> 51:23.440
and stuff. Um, so I have to finish that and I think that'll be about it. Um, now much left to

51:23.440 --> 51:27.040
go, but I'm going to still work on that. But later this week though, we are going to be doing a vog

51:27.040 --> 51:33.200
or two vog gaming nights for grant the thought online one day on PlayStation three, one day on

51:33.200 --> 51:38.240
X-Box three 60. So stay tuned the forums. I'm thinking right now that it's going to be Friday,

51:38.240 --> 51:44.400
Saturday. I just have to make sure it doesn't conflict with any shows. That's about it.

51:44.960 --> 51:48.560
Uh, as long as it's not Saturday night when us L is on, you should be good.

51:49.680 --> 51:52.640
If you do it a little earlier in the night, Saturday, Saturday should be fine.

51:52.640 --> 51:57.360
Maybe in the middle of week then. Yeah, we'll see. All right. Just stay tuned to the, uh,

51:57.360 --> 52:01.200
forums. We have a thread in the forums and I'll put times there. So sounds good.

52:01.840 --> 52:07.520
All right. Uh, my gaming week, uh, I told you all about the, uh, show, uh, that I did on yesterday.

52:07.520 --> 52:11.760
So, um, that took a big bite out of most of my gaming time this week, just like last week,

52:11.760 --> 52:16.000
unfortunately. Uh, so I'm going to get caught up this week. I did play a little bit of final

52:16.000 --> 52:20.960
fantasy 14. Um, not as much as you'd think based on what I said last week. Um, I was fortunate

52:20.960 --> 52:25.520
enough to get into hearthstone beta, which is a blizzards, a free to play trading card game.

52:25.520 --> 52:29.200
Uh, I talked a little bit about this at length on the hoard house. I'll kind of repeat some of

52:29.200 --> 52:34.080
that here. Um, I did enjoy the game well enough, especially for something that's free to play.

52:34.080 --> 52:39.440
I found the gameplay to be a little bit basic, but some card game affectionados who know this stuff

52:39.440 --> 52:44.000
a little more than I do, uh, seem to really enjoy it and kind of find the depth in it that I'm

52:44.000 --> 52:48.800
currently, I guess not seeing or whatever. I was really surprised kind of like that you draw so

52:48.800 --> 52:53.920
few cards and it's really like, you know, the man is all just kind of built in. You don't have cards

52:53.920 --> 52:57.920
on your own for that or whatever. So, um, but I guess the easy to play thing is really to try to

52:57.920 --> 53:02.400
draw in as many people as possible. And kind of my final verdict on hearthstone from what I've

53:02.400 --> 53:06.560
played on it so far is that I think it's going to be a great tablet game. And I really look forward

53:06.560 --> 53:10.240
to it on tablets because I like the idea of just kind of being able to like, you know, lie in bed

53:10.240 --> 53:14.720
before I go to sleep and, you know, play around with just the touch controls. But if I'm sitting

53:14.720 --> 53:20.240
down at my PC, I kind of think there's other games I might want to play that, that really aren't

53:20.240 --> 53:26.080
hearthstone. Um, one of those games I would want to play is a game I did get a chance to check out

53:26.080 --> 53:30.960
quickly this week, which is audio surf 2. Now this game is still in development. It's something

53:30.960 --> 53:35.360
that's on steam early access. So I don't want to review the game per se. I just kind of want to

53:35.360 --> 53:40.560
say, Hey, it's out there. You can check it out. Uh, one of the big differences I'm noticing between

53:40.560 --> 53:45.040
audio surf 2 and audio surf 1, which is a game I really enjoyed too. And if you haven't played

53:45.040 --> 53:52.000
audio surf 1, um, it's a game that uses your own music too. And then the first game you had these

53:52.000 --> 53:56.640
different modes, but like the main mode was sort of like, you would pick up these colored blocks

53:56.640 --> 54:02.800
as you would speed down a tunnel, uh, that is set to whatever your song is. And it kind of, kind of

54:02.800 --> 54:06.960
was like clacks. I don't know if any of you remember that nineties puzzler clacks, remember

54:06.960 --> 54:10.000
that where they come down the conveyor belt, the colored pieces would come down the conveyor belt

54:10.000 --> 54:15.040
and you try to match three match five. You kind of tried to do that really quick and audio surf,

54:15.040 --> 54:20.560
but audio surf had a mode that I thought was way better called the mono mode where it was just

54:20.560 --> 54:24.880
pick up, you know, the pieces are black or white and it's just about navigating and being able to

54:24.880 --> 54:30.480
move through the field as fast as possible. So you pick up only the pieces that are colorful and not

54:30.480 --> 54:35.680
the pieces that are, you know, the wrong color. Um, so I like that mode the best. And it seems

54:35.680 --> 54:39.760
like they're trying to kind of capitalize on that a little bit in audio surf 2, at least the modes

54:39.760 --> 54:44.000
that are in there right now is kind of the mono mode, but the mode I really like, one of the

54:44.000 --> 54:48.000
things they have in there right now is, is like a, um, it's like, Oh, I remember the name of it.

54:48.080 --> 54:52.640
It was like a wave race type of mode, because what you can do is that like, let's say, you know,

54:52.640 --> 54:57.120
you're about to go down a big hill because when the tempo of the song picks up, you start to go

54:57.120 --> 55:01.360
down a hill. Well, what you do is you swing your character all the way to a side of the side of

55:01.360 --> 55:05.760
the tunnel and click the mouse button and they'll like fly up in the air. And then you're flying

55:05.760 --> 55:10.000
down the hill and you do tricks in the air. And then you kind of land like, it's like,

55:10.000 --> 55:13.360
like you're in like a jet ski type thing and you do these tricks. And I thought that was a really

55:13.360 --> 55:18.960
cool little innovation. And that's like, I, the way that plays and feels because, you know,

55:19.520 --> 55:23.120
that's when the crescendos of the music happens. So to kind of do like this whole, like,

55:23.120 --> 55:26.960
right when the crescendo of a big dance song hits, like boom, I'm going to go flying in the

55:26.960 --> 55:31.440
air and do all these tricks. Like it's, it's really rewarding in that sort of way. So, um,

55:32.320 --> 55:36.480
yeah, I'm, I'm liking what I'm seeing of audio surf 2 so far, I guess one of the other big

55:36.480 --> 55:40.480
things they're going to do with it is mods. They want to have more and more mods and user created

55:40.480 --> 55:46.240
stuff. I imagine this is going to be a part of that steam, uh, what do they call this steam

55:46.240 --> 55:50.000
community marketplace or something like that, where people can make their own stuff like they

55:50.000 --> 55:54.160
have with Skyrim and civilization and stuff. I can't imagine this game isn't going to incorporate

55:54.160 --> 56:00.080
that big time. So, uh, yeah, I am looking forward to seeing what further develops audio surf too,

56:00.080 --> 56:03.840
but that's pretty much been my gaming week is just those games. Otherwise I've been pretty busy

56:04.400 --> 56:08.880
with other stuff. So let's get into some housekeeping and then we'll get into the news

56:08.880 --> 56:12.720
tonight. Uh, for tonight's housekeeping, I did want to mention quickly because I forgot to

56:12.720 --> 56:19.520
mention last week. Um, I, uh, was on a, another show, uh, the let's wow podcast last week,

56:19.520 --> 56:24.080
episode 31 that is now on the feed. But when I was talking about that, I forgot to plug,

56:24.080 --> 56:29.600
uh, gamut's stream that he's doing this Tuesday on into Wednesday, he's going to be doing a 24

56:29.600 --> 56:35.120
hour live stream for charity. He's raising money for breast cancer awareness month. He's trying to,

56:35.360 --> 56:38.800
you know, kind of bring attention to that, especially because, uh, world of Warcraft

56:38.800 --> 56:43.120
has such a huge community behind it and the online gaming stuff in general. I think, uh, you know,

56:43.120 --> 56:47.760
it's a great way to kind of say, Oh, Hey, while you're playing these games, don't forget that

56:47.760 --> 56:53.120
there's this type of awareness going on in the real world. And, you know, uh, cancer really sucks

56:53.120 --> 56:57.760
and we have to keep fighting it and raising money through research. So, um, I think that's really

56:57.760 --> 57:01.600
cool that he's doing this video game, uh, live stream to support that. Uh, so I want to give

57:01.600 --> 57:06.640
that a plug. You can check out more information on his website, gamuthunts.com. Uh, and he'll be

57:06.640 --> 57:12.720
streaming that on his Twitch channel on Tuesday. Uh, otherwise the only other thing I can think of

57:12.720 --> 57:19.040
to plug here is that of course we are on Twitter, twitter.com slash O L R. We're also on Facebook,

57:19.040 --> 57:26.240
facebook.com slash orange lounge radio. And, uh, I think that's it. That's all I've got to plug

57:26.240 --> 57:31.440
right now. So I guess we should get into some news. Loki. All right. So, um, let's talk a

57:31.440 --> 57:39.520
little bit about, um, new devices coming out and you may remember we talked briefly about the Mojo,

57:39.520 --> 57:44.320
which I think is pretty cool. The Mad Catz micro console that's going to have Android games and

57:44.320 --> 57:49.760
stuff on it. What's kind of unique about it is that it can actually play normal Android games.

57:49.760 --> 57:56.160
It's not a separate marketplace. You can actually map the controls and stuff. The only problem with

57:57.120 --> 58:03.120
it though is it's $250. Um, but yeah, so they announced $250. It's up for pre-order. Ships in

58:03.120 --> 58:10.640
December, tentatively. Um, some of the specs on it. It's going to be, uh, it's going to have 16

58:10.640 --> 58:21.040
gigabytes of storage with a micro SD, uh, support. Also they have, um, I guess, uh, a 1.8 gigahertz

58:21.120 --> 58:26.160
Tegra 4 processor. So it's definitely more powerful than like say an Ouya and it comes

58:26.160 --> 58:32.000
with a special, um, uh, controller that's Bluetooth enabled, which allows you to also,

58:32.800 --> 58:38.560
uh, I guess use it on like Android or as a PC controller or even use like mouse input and stuff.

58:39.360 --> 58:43.840
Um, so that's pretty cool. And then one of the other cool things that you can do with this,

58:43.840 --> 58:49.760
and I guess it kind of helps warrant the $250 price point is that you can actually stream PC

58:49.760 --> 58:55.520
games with it. So that's going to be coming, I think after it launches. Um, and it's going to

58:55.520 --> 59:00.800
wait a minute. Loki, isn't that supposed to be the steam machines thing? Well, technically, yeah,

59:00.800 --> 59:06.720
I guess it could be, but, um, I think it's kind of cool. Uh, they've got, let's see,

59:06.720 --> 59:16.000
here's some more specs on the Mojo, uh, two gigs of Ram and, um, one USB 2.0 and one USB 3.0 port.

59:16.000 --> 59:23.080
I mean, that's pretty cool that it supports that Bluetooth 4.0 and it's running Android 4.22. Um,

59:24.880 --> 59:28.880
and they even have a headphone socket on there. So that's kind of cool. You can listen to your

59:28.880 --> 59:35.760
audio through that. Um, I don't know. I think for the, for 250 bucks and it can stream games

59:35.760 --> 59:41.920
to your TV. That's kind of cool. If it was just strictly an Android box, um, that probably

59:41.920 --> 59:48.560
wouldn't be worth it for 250 bucks. So I don't know. What would you think would make, make it

59:48.560 --> 59:54.880
worth the cost for 250 bucks? It's going to do a lot more than just, you know, play Android games.

59:54.880 --> 01:00:01.040
I think, um, the controller looks nice at least. It's just, you mean you can, I guess a lot of

01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:06.240
people have their phones and stuff and it would cost a lot less to probably just get an HDMI out

01:00:06.240 --> 01:00:11.280
on your phone or get some other type of streaming thing. Uh, since it does support Android, I

01:00:11.280 --> 01:00:17.200
suppose you could also use this as like a box to watch Netflix or Hulu or anything like that on.

01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:22.880
Um, so there's just my living room needs another Netflix device. I don't have any of those. Some

01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:27.840
people don't have a lot of stuff or some people might want a second one or third or fourth or

01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:33.760
whatever. Um, and plus it looks kind of nice. I mean, it's shiny. It's got blue light on front.

01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:38.080
I don't normally purchase my consoles based on lights, but it definitely looks better.

01:00:39.040 --> 01:00:46.240
Um, 57 LEDs. I think the price was a little expensive. Maybe if it comes down to price

01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:51.040
later on, it might be worth it for me. But, um, I just don't need any more consoles right now,

01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:59.200
but the controller looks nice. I mean, if I could use on 360 or a PS3, I might be down with that.

01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:05.200
All right. Well, uh, going to some stories about the Xbox one happening out there, uh, there was,

01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:11.040
so a lot of talk this week about, uh, you know, there's been a lot of talk about the connect

01:01:11.040 --> 01:01:14.960
and privacy and all that, you know, ever since they announced the whole always on thing, there

01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:19.120
was the concerns about privacy. Well, I don't think it's even necessarily that it's more ever

01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:23.120
since they announced, you know, all that, all that stuff leaking out and no Microsoft's in bed with

01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:27.680
the NSA type thing. Well, yeah, yeah. But I mean, this is even really about that, but it's been on

01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:31.760
people's minds because of that ever since they announced the system. And, uh, this was kind of

01:01:31.840 --> 01:01:35.200
an interesting, uh, development on that this week. Uh, I'm going to totally pronounce this

01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:40.240
name, so I apologize, but it's Yusuf Mehdi, who is the corporate vice president of marketing and

01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:44.400
strategy for Microsoft was talking to the national advertisers, masters of marketing conference.

01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:48.960
This is happening in Phoenix, uh, earlier this week, he was talking about some of the, uh,

01:01:48.960 --> 01:01:53.600
things that the Xbox one could do that could actually affect marketing and how it's going to be,

01:01:53.600 --> 01:01:59.440
um, even bigger than the PlayStation four in terms of the marketing. And this would have to do with,

01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:05.040
Xbox's imaging technology, uh, talking about moving the gamification movement along and

01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:09.680
advertise me. And if you haven't heard that term gamification before, uh, you know, it's

01:02:09.680 --> 01:02:14.800
making games out of advertising, like, you know, interactive flash type things. Uh, the fact that

01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:19.760
like, like, uh, take a social app, like four square is gamifying social media by, you know,

01:02:19.760 --> 01:02:23.920
you check in, you get points, there's the mayor ship, there's all that. That's all gamification

01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:30.400
because games are fun. Look at vog network.com gamified, uh, a radio network of independent

01:02:30.400 --> 01:02:34.000
podcasts and kind of made a game out of that. That's, that's gamification. The catch pull ones.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:38.720
We have to park the car to get your catch. Yes. Which we actually use on vog network.com,

01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:43.520
which is a fun one. Yeah. Or reverse the people who use their advertising as a catch.

01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:49.120
Oh yeah. Where you have to type in like, you know, the product, what product is blah, blah, blah.

01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:53.360
Just do it. You know, you have to type in the slogan or whatever, but anyway, uh, talking about

01:02:53.360 --> 01:02:59.360
also consolidating, uh, more attention that's diffused otherwise on multiple devices. Uh,

01:02:59.360 --> 01:03:05.200
X-Box one will make it easier to port real time fantasy football data into the TV screen as people

01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:09.920
watch their NFL games. It does sound kind of interesting. I know some people that are really

01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:15.120
into fantasy football and I could sort of see that with a connects going to help do that. Well,

01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:19.920
the X-Box one does that because it's that whole like connect supposed to do that. You can watch

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:24.240
the TV and like the three quarters window and then around the edge kind of has your game,

01:03:24.240 --> 01:03:28.320
gamify or whatever. Yeah. But I'm just trying to figure out how the connect is actually

01:03:28.320 --> 01:03:33.520
going to enhance something that basically I could feed into it. Normally I'm just saying like,

01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:39.600
unless is it going to recognize that, you know, say I'm following me on my team of players because

01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:45.920
it knows my face. And so that's going to display that stat, those stats. And I don't know. Well,

01:03:45.920 --> 01:03:52.640
anyway, some of this chat led people to believe that, uh, Oh, they're going to harvest ad data

01:03:52.640 --> 01:03:58.400
through the connect. But, uh, Microsoft came out after all of this and said, hold on, no, no,

01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:04.560
this is not what we're doing. Uh, and, uh, yeah, this just said, nobody is working on that. That's

01:04:04.560 --> 01:04:08.880
not something that happened. It is not going to happen without the user having control over it.

01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:13.200
But see, here's my opinion. They can say this until they're blue in the face,

01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:19.440
but this ultimately becomes an issue of, do you trust Microsoft? And that can be very frustrating

01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:23.120
for a company like Microsoft. Like we're not doing it. Why won't people believe us?

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:28.720
But there's some people out there that have that distrust question. That corporate stuff

01:04:28.720 --> 01:04:33.600
probably comes from the fact that there's all these dirty rumors out there of all these

01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:37.120
horrible things that Microsoft could possibly be doing. And then they came out and said,

01:04:37.120 --> 01:04:41.760
yep, we're going to do all that. And then Sony said, Nope, we're not going to do all that.

01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:46.000
And then Microsoft said, no, we're actually not going to do that now. And we're not going to do

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.960
that now. And we're not going to do that now because, because you people don't like it,

01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:53.840
but we may implement those features in the future. You know, it's just,

01:04:55.760 --> 01:05:00.320
you know, it's a whole flip-flopping that makes people kind of unwary about that stuff.

01:05:00.320 --> 01:05:09.040
Um, I think, I mean, what was kind of, I don't know, I guess concerning would have been the

01:05:09.040 --> 01:05:13.600
features that, okay, we can recognize individual people. We can cater ads based on those people

01:05:13.600 --> 01:05:18.080
that are, happen to be sitting in front of, you know, the screen. We can recognize, you know,

01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:22.080
whether they're looking at the ad because we can see where their eyes are looking or something

01:05:22.080 --> 01:05:26.560
like that, you know, or, you know, they're how long they're engaged in watching that.

01:05:26.560 --> 01:05:31.360
Some of this has to do with patents too. Like, you know, and, and it causes a lot of buzz going

01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:36.240
on through. Cause I remember when was it wasn't Microsoft that has that patent for, it can detect

01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:41.280
like who is actually watching the film and lock the person who's not the owner out of watching

01:05:41.280 --> 01:05:45.680
the movie or see like if there's more than 10 people watching the movie that, you know,

01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:49.440
it could charge a different rate or something like that. And people really ran with that patent,

01:05:49.440 --> 01:05:53.360
even though it's just a patent. It's not something that they're actually necessarily thinking about

01:05:53.360 --> 01:05:56.880
doing. I don't remember. I apologize if I'm misrepresenting the facts. I don't remember

01:05:56.880 --> 01:06:00.960
if that was Microsoft or Sony. I'm pretty sure it was Microsoft, but we have a live chat. I'm

01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:04.960
sure I'll get corrected here in a minute if I was wrong, but I seem to recall that was an issue like

01:06:05.040 --> 01:06:10.560
a year ago on the show gamification of stuff with connect and like these stupid interactive ads and

01:06:10.560 --> 01:06:15.280
stuff through connect on the Microsoft. Well, it's funny, funny you say that. Cause Tiger

01:06:15.280 --> 01:06:19.680
Claude chat at live.hognetwork.com says you think they'll have achievements just for watching an ad

01:06:20.640 --> 01:06:23.760
and a dark soccer. You're responding to him in chat, talking about Gaia online,

01:06:23.760 --> 01:06:28.480
which kind of does something like that. Yeah. You like get Gaia gold for doing surveys and

01:06:28.480 --> 01:06:32.400
watching their stupid little ads. I used to do Gaia back in the day. Well, I think, okay,

01:06:32.400 --> 01:06:37.760
well maybe Microsoft doesn't necessarily have that yet, but you got achievements from playing

01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:43.040
those Burger King games. There was achievements in Yaris, which was an adver game, but Burger King

01:06:43.040 --> 01:06:47.520
games were just genius. I actually get the Burger King games were really like, and I'm very

01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:52.320
disappointed that there's no new Burger King games because they were, they were creepy in their own

01:06:52.320 --> 01:06:58.400
way and it was just, it was fun. But besides, besides all of that, uh, I also think though

01:06:58.400 --> 01:07:02.240
that, you know, Microsoft has said there's going to be an achievement for like day one

01:07:02.240 --> 01:07:07.520
Xbox purchasing, like a day one adopter. So, I mean, that might not be advertising per se,

01:07:07.520 --> 01:07:11.440
but they are definitely willing to put achievements in things that are not games.

01:07:13.200 --> 01:07:17.280
Well, they are there. I think they were talking about like TV watching and stuff like that is

01:07:17.280 --> 01:07:22.160
part of an achievement. Plus remember now Xbox rewards and stuff, they give you rewards for

01:07:22.160 --> 01:07:25.840
doing different things. Who's to say they couldn't give you rewards for watching ads.

01:07:26.240 --> 01:07:31.520
Code man in our chat room at live.thognetwork.com says it's not that we need less marketing. It's

01:07:31.520 --> 01:07:37.920
that we need more less annoying marketing. Well, let me ask this tough question. What is that?

01:07:37.920 --> 01:07:43.120
Then what, what is marketing that is not annoying? I think that's a tough question to answer because

01:07:43.120 --> 01:07:48.320
I think whenever a lot of people feel like they're being kind of like pandered to or marketed to,

01:07:48.320 --> 01:07:52.800
they might feel a little bit annoyed. So what's not annoying? I actually don't mind product

01:07:53.520 --> 01:07:58.080
placement in a game or in a movie as long as it's not obtrusive.

01:07:59.280 --> 01:08:04.240
Like, you know, the billboards and crazy taxis, what I think of, or take me to KFC, you know,

01:08:04.240 --> 01:08:08.480
like I didn't, I wasn't annoyed with that. I actually found it funny. It was kind of funny

01:08:08.480 --> 01:08:12.720
or, you know, it's stuff that you see in real life. You know, you're driving through the town,

01:08:12.720 --> 01:08:18.000
you may see an ad for, you know, like a racing game. They have all the Valvoline and

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:21.600
Ferrelli and all that, you know, that's what you see at an actual racing track.

01:08:21.600 --> 01:08:28.080
That's realistic advertising in the game. Or, you know, for example, character walks into,

01:08:28.080 --> 01:08:35.600
you know, a snack room and goes to a Pepsi machine and gets a Diet Pepsi. That's unobtrusive

01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:39.200
marketing. That's something that would happen in real life. It all depends. I mean, I've seen

01:08:39.200 --> 01:08:42.640
people complain about that kind of stuff in, you know, games where they'll have, you know,

01:08:43.200 --> 01:08:48.240
Mountain Dew or something. And it's like, so you're 22 or five or something ridiculous,

01:08:48.240 --> 01:08:51.760
you know, in the future. And there's all these Mountain Dew machines everywhere.

01:08:51.760 --> 01:08:57.120
I think like, if you want to do, I think people need to feel, because right now they feel, okay,

01:08:57.120 --> 01:09:03.040
we're being charged for online. And now we're also being advertised to at the same time, because

01:09:03.040 --> 01:09:08.000
look at the PlayStation network. They don't really have ads all over the place on the PlayStation,

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:11.920
you know, cross media bar. There's not ads. I mean, there's a little advertisement ticker

01:09:11.920 --> 01:09:15.920
thing in the corner. We're talking about sales and stuff and games coming up, but it's not like

01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:20.320
a Doritos commercial or something like that. Your system defaults to what's new and it might show,

01:09:20.320 --> 01:09:23.680
like it'll show things that you own, but it'll also show things that are in the marketplace

01:09:23.680 --> 01:09:27.200
in there, but that's not terrible. But that's, that's not really that bad.

01:09:27.200 --> 01:09:32.880
But Microsoft though, they have fucking little tiles with, you know, ads in them. And a lot of

01:09:32.880 --> 01:09:36.960
people think, well, wait a second. And especially, you know, just comparing stuff in the current gen

01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:44.560
marketplace, you have Microsoft that's charging for online, Sony that's not charging for online.

01:09:44.560 --> 01:09:49.680
There's no ads there. And Microsoft on top of charging you, they're also throwing ads in your

01:09:49.680 --> 01:09:55.200
face, whether it be in the corner of the screen and you don't necessarily have to see it, you

01:09:55.200 --> 01:10:00.880
know, but it's still there. And people are like, what the fuck? You know, aren't you getting enough

01:10:00.880 --> 01:10:05.680
money from me already? And now you're making ad dollars on top of that. And so that's kind of

01:10:05.680 --> 01:10:10.560
where the problem is. Xenocore in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says beer commercials are

01:10:10.560 --> 01:10:14.640
awesome marketing. Most interesting man in the world is awesome marketing. You know, that kind

01:10:14.640 --> 01:10:18.320
of had me thinking is that, well, you know, it is very interesting when we talk about marketing

01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:22.800
vices, especially things like beer, you know, who has traditionally had, you know, Budweiser has

01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:27.120
had some of the like biggest commercials you can possibly think of out there in history.

01:10:27.120 --> 01:10:30.800
And then I kind of think of, you know, what's really fascinating. And this is kind of an

01:10:30.800 --> 01:10:34.800
unpopular opinion. I'm not saying it's good. I'm just saying it's fascinating is that look at the

01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:38.880
history of cigarette advertising, because those people are having stones. Well, those people

01:10:38.880 --> 01:10:45.440
are having to advertise something that they know kills people. So it's, it's, it's really amazing

01:10:45.440 --> 01:10:50.880
to see how they market that. Well, have you looked into the history of cigarette marketing?

01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:55.440
Not like professionally, but I just, I can think of what I saw when I was a kid, back when there

01:10:55.440 --> 01:11:00.880
were vending machines and restaurants and what I see now, they used to do Marlboro ads featuring

01:11:00.880 --> 01:11:05.200
the Flintstones. It was like Marlboro tastes good, like a cigarette should. And then they

01:11:05.200 --> 01:11:12.880
would have doctor endorsements in magazines prior to the sixties. They would have actual written

01:11:12.880 --> 01:11:18.480
doctor endorsements for cigarettes being good for you. You know, and of course, you know, now

01:11:18.480 --> 01:11:23.280
truth in advertising is a really, really big thing. So of course we don't have that anymore,

01:11:23.280 --> 01:11:30.320
nor do we have the television ads. Or the old, although I have seen those little vending machines

01:11:30.320 --> 01:11:35.120
repurposed. I have too. Yeah. That's kind of funny how they'll put those old cigarette

01:11:35.120 --> 01:11:40.560
machines to use. There's a, I think at the Crocker museum, they actually do, um, replicas of some of

01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:45.840
the art pieces or, or it's small scale or the flip because they don't really make cigarette vending

01:11:45.840 --> 01:11:49.760
machines anymore. At least not in California. Like if you go to a bar where they do sell cigarettes

01:11:49.760 --> 01:11:53.120
in the outdoor area, which is the only place you can smoke. It's like the type of vending machine

01:11:53.120 --> 01:11:58.560
that sells chips and cookies in other places with a little, it's, it's fascinating to me.

01:11:58.560 --> 01:12:02.960
I miss the old cigarette machine aesthetic, even if I don't agree with the product. Yeah, yeah,

01:12:02.960 --> 01:12:09.200
yeah. No, the old cigarette machine, I should say that kind of cool, but like the knob and outcome,

01:12:09.200 --> 01:12:15.440
your smoke, but that's also marketing in a way. And it's, it's cigarettes that are,

01:12:15.440 --> 01:12:20.080
you're not supposed to be having, but keep in mind this happened. Remember what I mentioned

01:12:20.080 --> 01:12:28.160
about the Crocker. They're using an almost a cultural artifact that we once associated with

01:12:28.160 --> 01:12:32.960
cigarettes. We know it's a, its purpose is to sell you something. Instead of selling you

01:12:32.960 --> 01:12:39.360
something harmful is selling you something beautiful. Although art is relative. Anyway,

01:12:39.360 --> 01:12:44.000
anyhow, we're getting a little off track here a little, but, uh, yeah, advertising, um,

01:12:44.800 --> 01:12:48.800
who knows what's going to develop in the future as, as entertainment gets more and more and more

01:12:48.800 --> 01:12:53.280
interactive, uh, they'll come up with something. Anyhow, Dark Sakura, before we get to release

01:12:53.280 --> 01:12:59.040
dates. Oh man, rage nator. I am not going to quote Dennis Larry except for, uh, what is it?

01:12:59.040 --> 01:13:05.200
You, you have the, you, how about life's going to suck when you grow up, when you have the orgasm,

01:13:05.200 --> 01:13:08.080
you smoke the, but you eat a cookie, you go to bed and that's the end of the story

01:13:09.280 --> 01:13:16.000
about what the meaning of happiness anyway. So, um, oh yeah. And the, uh, I only want to eat

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:22.160
meat from cows that smoke. Oh, okay. Video games, Silent Hill. How about Silent Hill?

01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:28.000
I'm going to have to smoke just to get through that game. My God. Just kidding.

01:13:28.560 --> 01:13:35.120
Don't you know that's what the fog is. So anyway, um, way forward, um, did Silent Hill

01:13:35.120 --> 01:13:40.720
book of memories. And, uh, it turns out though that before they did Contra four that they were,

01:13:40.720 --> 01:13:48.240
um, they had a prototype out for, um, a, uh, another Silent Hill game for the Nintendo DS

01:13:48.880 --> 01:13:54.400
and their little prototype starred, um, the dude from Silent Hill two. And it had, uh,

01:13:54.400 --> 01:13:58.560
there was some video out about it, about, you know, what it was supposed to, to look like.

01:13:58.560 --> 01:14:04.000
But of course that got canceled and they also had, and this makes me think back to the whole,

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:12.800
um, biohazard, uh, 1.5 where, um, they had a completely different version of Silent Hill book

01:14:12.800 --> 01:14:19.840
of memories and ended up, I suppose, scrapping it and doing it what we have now. But, uh,

01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:24.880
the, um, quote on there was saying is that they had, uh, two different perspectives for in the

01:14:24.880 --> 01:14:32.000
game. This one would switch between an isometric and an over the shoulder. And they were looking

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:39.280
more at the combat and puzzle, uh, elements, um, to zoom out, but they said that the technology

01:14:39.280 --> 01:14:45.520
just wasn't there to do it. So they switched how they did it. Um, but there is a video out

01:14:45.520 --> 01:14:51.520
there of what the, uh, I'd say original concept of chain of memories was for anyone who's interested

01:14:51.520 --> 01:14:58.560
in it, which for me, I love, um, I love looking at prototypes and the differences. I would still

01:14:58.560 --> 01:15:04.560
love to find a playable, um, biohazard 1.5 just so that I could see for myself what the differences

01:15:04.560 --> 01:15:10.480
were. But I love when they come out and say, well, this is what you almost got unless what

01:15:10.480 --> 01:15:15.280
we almost got would have been better. You know what I mean? But I wouldn't have minded having a

01:15:15.280 --> 01:15:22.800
good, um, solid Silent Hill game on my DS. Yeah. Book of memories got a lot of kind of hate though.

01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:26.960
It wasn't it. See the thing with book of memories, like I didn't hate the game, but it wasn't

01:15:26.960 --> 01:15:31.600
Silent Hill to me. It was very much not Silent Hill to me, which it was definitely like more of

01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:36.080
like a spinoff type of game. I haven't wanted to play a Silent Hill game since homecoming.

01:15:36.720 --> 01:15:41.360
I think honestly think that homecoming is the last, I'm not even going to say great Silent

01:15:41.360 --> 01:15:47.680
Hill game. It's one of the last good faithful Silent Hill games to me. So. All right. Well,

01:15:47.680 --> 01:15:51.120
let's travel around the world and check out release dates of games that will, you know,

01:15:51.120 --> 01:15:56.080
actually be coming out. You know, it's pretty good that that Silent Hill game didn't come out because

01:15:56.080 --> 01:16:00.160
if you remember correctly, uh, all the portable Silent Hill games haven't been very good. Like

01:16:00.160 --> 01:16:05.680
you remember the PSP ones and stuff. It's just. I never really played the PSP one. I remember it

01:16:05.680 --> 01:16:12.320
though. That was origins, right? Uh, I think, yeah, cause I'm confusing. There's that PSP one.

01:16:12.320 --> 01:16:19.360
They ported it to PS2. Oh yeah. Okay. Um, anyways, this week, not a whole ton of stuff coming out.

01:16:19.360 --> 01:16:26.640
It's more of like a, uh, catch up week, I guess. Um, so PlayStation three, Xbox 360, and Wii.

01:16:27.200 --> 01:16:32.800
You've, I hope you like hunting because, uh, Cabela's African adventures, uh, will be coming

01:16:32.800 --> 01:16:46.240
out this week. Also on, um, was it a PlayStation three as well? Uh, see here we had, I want to say

01:16:46.240 --> 01:16:50.320
was it this guy? Yeah, this guy did too. No, actually that was last week. I'm sorry. Uh,

01:16:50.320 --> 01:16:58.400
Cabela's are not Cabela's. So wipe out, create and crash on Wii U, 3DS, Wii, um, Xbox 360.

01:16:59.360 --> 01:17:05.600
And of course the Xbox 360 one's a connect game. Also, what else was there this week?

01:17:06.320 --> 01:17:09.120
Seriously? Not a lot of anything. Um,

01:17:12.080 --> 01:17:17.680
it's not it. That can't be it. You all right. There's just not a lot of,

01:17:17.680 --> 01:17:21.360
there's a lot of garbage coming out. Oh, here we go. You're just weeding through the garbage

01:17:21.360 --> 01:17:26.720
right now through the garbage. Yeah. Cause, um, and last year, last few things this week,

01:17:26.720 --> 01:17:35.120
a cradle of Egypt to, uh, for 3DS and girls fashioned shoot on 3DS. That's literally it.

01:17:36.400 --> 01:17:41.520
Alrighty. All right. Uh, going to Japan and checking out what is coming out in Japan.

01:17:43.520 --> 01:17:47.120
Yeah, I should, I should have called her and been like, Hey, I hate to interrupt your honeymoon and

01:17:47.120 --> 01:17:52.000
God knows what's going on right now, but are there lines for another monster hunter? I know

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:55.920
I got to ask you what's on the shelves over there. We do have to get her and silent Nathan back on

01:17:55.920 --> 01:18:01.280
the show though. Miss them. All right. Uh, coming out on October 17th, uh, on the PlayStation three

01:18:01.280 --> 01:18:05.680
over in Japan beyond two souls is getting its release in Japan is the first print limited

01:18:05.680 --> 01:18:10.800
edition, uh, as well as regular, uh, FIFA 14 world-class soccer and some various, uh,

01:18:10.880 --> 01:18:15.680
additions, St. Seiya, brave soldiers and regular limited edition.

01:18:15.680 --> 01:18:20.800
No way. They're doing a St. Seiya game? Brave soldiers. That's an old series.

01:18:21.680 --> 01:18:26.560
So that's, uh, yeah, that's coming out on the PlayStation three, uh, coming out on the

01:18:26.560 --> 01:18:32.880
Xbox 360 this week in Japan. Um, FIFA 14, cause you know, that game is huge and there's a like

01:18:32.880 --> 01:18:39.920
Xbox live card kind of pack-ins to go with that. Uh, on the Vita this week, FIFA 14 is there as

01:18:39.920 --> 01:18:45.200
well. I'm thinking the FIFA 14 is kind of a big release this week. Uh, but on the Wii U it's all

01:18:45.200 --> 01:18:50.560
about Rayman legends, which sees this release in Japan this week on October the 17th. Uh,

01:18:50.560 --> 01:18:56.720
lastly checking the 3DS here. Uh, actually not a lot of stuff this week, probably just cause

01:18:56.720 --> 01:19:01.920
they're coming off the Pokemon high. There's still a lot of cases and accessories and things,

01:19:01.920 --> 01:19:08.240
but there is one game coming out from Namco Bandai this week. And, uh, I'm going to butcher this name.

01:19:08.240 --> 01:19:17.440
It is Sentotuchu Densetsu no Shinobi 2 Survival Battle. And all I have is a screenshot and the

01:19:17.440 --> 01:19:22.720
little subtitle on it is battle for money. So it looks like kind of like a ninja fighting type of

01:19:22.720 --> 01:19:26.720
game. It also says Fuji television. So what if this isn't based on some type of game show

01:19:26.720 --> 01:19:32.480
in Japan, or maybe it's like a ninja, you know, like a ninja warrior type of,

01:19:32.480 --> 01:19:37.280
they get all the cool shows, a ninja fighting game or a fighting show. Yeah. I just noticed

01:19:37.280 --> 01:19:41.200
that there's a little copyright Fuji television. So it's gotta be based on some type of TV show.

01:19:41.200 --> 01:19:46.800
So it looks kind of fun, but that's it for Japanese release dates. Uh, how about the UK

01:19:46.800 --> 01:19:54.960
Darusaka? Uh, well, let's see, there's not a whole big pile of stuff coming out. We have on the 17th,

01:19:54.960 --> 01:20:01.440
we have device six for, uh, IOS. We have pocket Titans also for IOS. And on the 18th,

01:20:01.520 --> 01:20:07.760
we have alien rage. We have Skylanders swap force and Skyla, uh, actually two different

01:20:07.760 --> 01:20:13.680
versions of a Skylanders swap force. Looks like the handheld, um, the 3DS,

01:20:13.680 --> 01:20:18.720
Xbox three 60 Wii U Wii PlayStation three. And then they're separating their release for the

01:20:18.720 --> 01:20:27.440
PlayStation four and the Xbox one. So that's it. Like I said, it was a little, yep. Not so small.

01:20:27.440 --> 01:20:31.440
You know, everybody's just too busy playing Pokemon except for all of us here at OLR.

01:20:33.040 --> 01:20:39.520
I I'll get in on that craze. I am not going to make poor Isabel make meth in the basement of

01:20:39.520 --> 01:20:46.400
my town hall to keep my flowers pretty. I just got Lobo and I just got Peck and I got Margie.

01:20:46.400 --> 01:20:50.560
I'm playing in my village. So you're not, you refuse to give up one addiction for another

01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:55.600
bitch, please. But as I told you, you can't visit my town this week to get petition signatures

01:20:55.600 --> 01:21:00.720
because my town went to Japan. My entire town got up and flew to Japan this week.

01:21:00.720 --> 01:21:07.920
That's okay. And Lord knows how princess Irene is corrupting my villagers at this very moment.

01:21:07.920 --> 01:21:11.360
It won't be the same. You want to know what's funny is that remember how butch

01:21:11.360 --> 01:21:14.640
moved from my town to yours, but she's been hanging out in my shopping center.

01:21:15.200 --> 01:21:16.480
So butch didn't want to go to Japan.

01:21:19.840 --> 01:21:25.200
All right. It's like they're real people. Okay. A few more news stories for you guys.

01:21:25.200 --> 01:21:28.320
Then the classic game of the week. But first, a very new game, right,

01:21:28.320 --> 01:21:30.960
Loki? And that's the best part about it is they're not even people.

01:21:34.320 --> 01:21:40.080
Yeah. Speaking of addictions, Grand Theft Auto five is officially broken. A bunch of records,

01:21:40.720 --> 01:21:47.600
including the PlayStation Network record for the most downloaded title in history of the

01:21:47.600 --> 01:21:54.800
PlayStation Network. And there's also some Guinness Book Records, which I don't know. So anyways,

01:21:54.800 --> 01:21:59.040
let's see. Best selling action adventure video game in twenty four hours. Best selling video

01:21:59.040 --> 01:22:05.200
game in twenty four hours. And they really narrow it down. Fastest entertainment property to gross

01:22:05.200 --> 01:22:09.840
one billion dollars. Fastest video game to gross one billion dollars. Highest

01:22:09.840 --> 01:22:14.160
grossing video game in twenty four hours. Highest revenue generated by an entertainment product in

01:22:14.160 --> 01:22:20.160
twenty four hours. And the most viewed trailer for an action adventure video game. I don't know

01:22:20.160 --> 01:22:22.960
if they really need trailer in there. I mean, that's just like.

01:22:25.200 --> 01:22:28.560
Can they go to advertisement? Can they go too far with like, you know,

01:22:30.240 --> 01:22:35.600
breaking down these records? I mean, this is all press release fodder. I mean, it is,

01:22:36.160 --> 01:22:39.840
although I shouldn't belittle some of these accomplishments, because obviously Grand Theft

01:22:39.840 --> 01:22:45.360
Auto, whether you like it or not or like it too much or not, it is a huge thing in the gaming

01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:51.040
industry, huge. And, you know, these records do back that up that that what a practically

01:22:51.040 --> 01:22:55.920
practically a cultural event these things are. I mean, when your video game gets parodied on

01:22:55.920 --> 01:23:00.800
Saturday Night Live, whether that show is funny or not anymore, I mean, that is saying something.

01:23:00.800 --> 01:23:04.080
And I don't know if you saw like the whole like angry mom sketch where she was talking

01:23:04.080 --> 01:23:07.440
about Grand Theft Auto five on Weekend Update. But the twist was that, like,

01:23:07.440 --> 01:23:10.160
she's not angry at the game. She's angry because she can't stop playing it.

01:23:10.160 --> 01:23:17.840
So, you know, I actually remember way back the David Chappelle show where he did the Grand Theft

01:23:17.840 --> 01:23:22.560
Auto parody. I do remember that switching like if your life was Grand Theft Auto.

01:23:22.560 --> 01:23:25.280
Yeah, that was funny. That was pretty funny. I remember that. Good stuff.

01:23:26.080 --> 01:23:31.520
Also, Grand Theft Auto Online, there's been some hiccups, but they almost have it all taken care

01:23:31.520 --> 01:23:36.960
of and to kind of compensate players and maybe get people more interested in checking out online.

01:23:37.040 --> 01:23:43.120
If you played any portion of the online in the month of October,

01:23:43.120 --> 01:23:48.720
you get a half a million dollars in in-game money. Yeah, that's in-game money,

01:23:48.720 --> 01:23:52.400
not an actual half million dollars. I wish that'd be awesome.

01:23:53.920 --> 01:23:59.520
So some of the headlines I saw out there was GTA to give their players a half million dollars.

01:23:59.520 --> 01:24:03.040
And then you click on the link and then the sub headline is in in-game cash.

01:24:03.440 --> 01:24:09.440
Of course, you bastard. Click me, click me. Of course, you know, you have to play during the

01:24:09.440 --> 01:24:16.720
month of October. You will have to also install the upcoming title update 1.04, which is going

01:24:16.720 --> 01:24:22.720
to fix some other problems and causing vehicle purchase losses and stuff like that. And then

01:24:22.720 --> 01:24:28.240
they're going to there's going to be two deposits of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars.

01:24:28.800 --> 01:24:34.080
I'm not sure when those are going to be coming up. It's like right after each other or if it's

01:24:34.080 --> 01:24:39.840
just, you know. Don't know how to do it, but that's cool. More money. Money's good.

01:24:42.640 --> 01:24:48.800
Then, of course, you know, it's interesting. This sort of happened with Grand Theft Auto

01:24:48.800 --> 01:24:54.080
San Andreas, except it wasn't necessarily that, you know, an artist was trying to sue the game

01:24:54.080 --> 01:25:00.480
because their music was being used without their permission, but it's because they thought the

01:25:00.480 --> 01:25:07.280
game was based off of their lifestyle. But anyways, there's an artist saying that he

01:25:07.280 --> 01:25:16.080
wants his music taken out of the game, and that's Daz Dillinger. And he has a couple tracks in there

01:25:16.080 --> 01:25:22.080
with, I guess, Corrupt under the group banner The Dog Pound. And so there's two tracks and

01:25:22.080 --> 01:25:27.040
he's saying that he was offered four thousand or four thousand two hundred seventy one dollars for

01:25:27.040 --> 01:25:36.960
his songs. But then I guess. Pass that offer up and I guess they use the music in in game,

01:25:36.960 --> 01:25:41.840
and now he thinks that he's do more money. I think what happened is, is they tried to go to

01:25:41.840 --> 01:25:46.000
the artist to license the track and end up going to the record label instead and licensing the

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:50.320
track. And now he's pissed off that he feels because they made a billion dollars that he

01:25:50.320 --> 01:25:53.760
wants more money or something. Right. Right. Which it sounds like he needs to take up the

01:25:53.760 --> 01:25:57.600
issue with his label, because the label's probably the one that sold the song out.

01:25:57.600 --> 01:26:01.920
And if they paid for the studio and they paid him to make the song, they own it, whether,

01:26:02.640 --> 01:26:07.440
you know. Unless there's something specifically in his contract about royalties. Which there could

01:26:07.440 --> 01:26:12.400
be. Yeah. We don't know. But it's weird to me. Like, I realize that that's kind of like the

01:26:12.400 --> 01:26:17.200
generally accepted like rationale of what Rockstar did and so forth. But what I don't get about it is

01:26:17.200 --> 01:26:22.320
that like, why were those songs so damn important? Like, you know, when we're talking about how huge

01:26:22.320 --> 01:26:27.600
this game is, I would think most artists would want to be in a game like this. Are those songs

01:26:27.600 --> 01:26:35.840
like, are they necessary to the plot? No. Like the Kanye song in Saints Row 3, kind of like,

01:26:35.840 --> 01:26:39.840
you can't do that scene without the song. It's really awesome. Exactly. You'd have to have

01:26:39.840 --> 01:26:44.320
certain songs. But like, are those songs necessary? No, it's just on the radio. They don't really.

01:26:44.880 --> 01:26:49.200
On the other thing too, is that he broke with those groups. Yeah. So the guy's actually not,

01:26:49.200 --> 01:26:54.480
unless it has to be some sort of bitterness association, you know, oh, I fell out with them.

01:26:54.480 --> 01:27:00.080
They owe me money. So there's, but I mean, there's probably tons of independent rap artists to get

01:27:00.080 --> 01:27:04.560
featured in a Grand Theft Auto game that would like, they would pay Rockstar money to have that

01:27:04.560 --> 01:27:07.920
opportunity. There's some good artists in there. In fact, like I started listening to some of the

01:27:07.920 --> 01:27:11.520
other stations because I was just listening to the classic rock station and actually have been

01:27:11.520 --> 01:27:16.560
listening to the pop station now, even though Britney's on there. And, uh, Britney Spears song

01:27:16.560 --> 01:27:23.120
Grand Theft Auto. They have, uh, Gimme More. That is one of my favorites. I was listening to the

01:27:23.120 --> 01:27:28.720
seventies station. That was hilarious. Um, but I was hoping they'd have Work Bitch. Cause I just,

01:27:28.720 --> 01:27:33.520
you know, no, I saw, yeah, I saw that advertisement on YouTube the other day. I'm like,

01:27:34.400 --> 01:27:38.560
what have you become Brittany? I mean, seriously, it's this whole reinvention of yourself. Call the

01:27:38.560 --> 01:27:45.280
governor. Um, there is actually, there's some good songs like on Radio Mirror Park. They have,

01:27:45.280 --> 01:27:53.600
um, it's all these independent guys, I guess. And they have a, um, a, uh, synth pop track that

01:27:53.600 --> 01:27:57.440
actually I put in my car. And it was actually the one that was in the trailer, the latest,

01:27:57.440 --> 01:28:05.520
the last trailer that they did for, um, yeah, for the game they had, uh, on there. And it was, uh,

01:28:06.400 --> 01:28:12.960
sleepwalking by the chain gang of 1974. Great, great artists that I discovered through the game,

01:28:12.960 --> 01:28:19.760
you know? And so, I don't know, that's what I like about this game. A perfect example of why

01:28:19.760 --> 01:28:24.000
artists should be, you know, excited to be in a Grand Theft Auto game. And look, I'm not saying

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:28.080
that like, you know, like Rockstar has the right to just use whatever they want and artists should

01:28:28.080 --> 01:28:32.880
just bend over and take it. But I'm just saying like, that's a good sign of like what the benefit

01:28:32.880 --> 01:28:37.840
could be, especially for maybe an artist who isn't like AAA or what have you. Um,

01:28:37.840 --> 01:28:42.880
and well, and this show was founded on DDR and I know I found so many artists through DDR,

01:28:42.880 --> 01:28:48.320
especially the Ultra X Games. And if anything, if you happen to not be familiar with the slight

01:28:48.960 --> 01:28:54.160
musical interlude that Eddie Murphy took part in, you get the wonderful track of Party All

01:28:54.160 --> 01:29:00.320
the Time on there, which is fantastic. It's fantastic. So that's worth it right there.

01:29:00.320 --> 01:29:05.280
I used Tim Curry's I Do The Rock last night at Rocky Horror and that was a pretty,

01:29:05.280 --> 01:29:10.560
pretty cheesy fucking song too. But yeah, it's pretty awesome when movie celebrities

01:29:10.560 --> 01:29:16.240
have singing careers. And some very exciting news. The guy that does the voice of Franklin,

01:29:16.240 --> 01:29:27.680
Sean Fontenot, he is working on a project with the voice actor from San Andreas who did the voice of

01:29:27.680 --> 01:29:39.760
CJ Young Marley. And basically this came up, I guess, at the New York Comic Con panel. And

01:29:40.640 --> 01:29:44.480
they're asking him questions on it, but he dodged the questions and changed the subject. So

01:29:45.680 --> 01:29:49.520
the thoughts maybe, you know, the thought at least I had from that is,

01:29:50.400 --> 01:29:55.200
ooh, CJ's coming back to San Andreas. That's pretty exciting. Even though they said that

01:29:55.280 --> 01:29:59.440
the whole universe that takes place before 4 doesn't really exist, I still think it's

01:29:59.440 --> 01:30:06.400
really exciting that, you know, CJ may make a return even though he would be like, you know,

01:30:06.400 --> 01:30:12.400
10 years older than actually, I don't know, since I think the game took place in the 90s in San

01:30:12.400 --> 01:30:17.120
Andreas. I haven't really sat down to think about a Grand Theft Auto timeline. But yeah,

01:30:17.120 --> 01:30:23.360
so very exciting. I hope that's some DLC coming because that would be pretty cool.

01:30:23.360 --> 01:30:28.320
By the way, Dan showed me something in Grand Theft Auto that actually completely had me in

01:30:28.320 --> 01:30:32.720
stitches. And that's the war vet that hangs out in front of that house by the fence,

01:30:33.600 --> 01:30:40.000
who talks all the conspiracy theory stuff. I sat and listened to that for like 30 minutes.

01:30:40.720 --> 01:30:46.960
It was freaking funny and sad and sad. So going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com,

01:30:46.960 --> 01:30:51.120
there's some other chat about great celebrity crossover songs. Dungeon Buster says,

01:30:51.120 --> 01:30:55.840
Don Johnson's heartbeat. Yes. Yeah, they totally like ripped from was it like the

01:30:55.840 --> 01:31:00.400
one hit wonders countdown that they did on like VH1 a while back.

01:31:01.360 --> 01:31:05.760
And then Bobby Black Wolf brought up this truly, truly classic song.

01:31:10.560 --> 01:31:13.360
The Ballad of Bilbo Baggins by Leonard Nimoy.

01:31:14.640 --> 01:31:19.360
This song is so fucking sad. Did you watch that commercial with him and Zachary Quinto?

01:31:20.240 --> 01:31:25.760
Uh, I, I, that sounds familiar. I think they're in each in their own car trying to get to the,

01:31:25.760 --> 01:31:30.960
the play golf. And while he's driving, he's singing the song.

01:31:32.160 --> 01:31:34.800
Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Let's not forget. Shatner had a whole,

01:31:35.680 --> 01:31:39.120
like at least two albums of him singing all of the hits.

01:31:43.040 --> 01:31:48.320
All right. Um, I don't know how to transition from that to this, but I'm going to try anyway.

01:31:49.280 --> 01:31:55.600
Some classic Square Enix properties, uh, going to smartphones and we start off with the news. I

01:31:55.600 --> 01:32:01.760
mean, this is huge news. The Dragon Quest series, uh, all eight games or the first eight,

01:32:01.760 --> 01:32:05.680
cause technically I think there's 10 of them now with the online one. Uh, there are the first

01:32:05.680 --> 01:32:11.680
eight games going to be coming out for iOS and Android. Dragon Quest one will be out this year,

01:32:11.680 --> 01:32:15.440
getting it all started. There's a teaser site out there saying that it will be coming out for iOS

01:32:15.520 --> 01:32:19.680
and Android in Japan, at least in the winter. We don't know how much that will cost,

01:32:19.680 --> 01:32:25.120
but if it's a Square Enix, you can count on a premium. Um, don't know which versions of the

01:32:25.120 --> 01:32:30.960
game either. So, uh, yeah, there you go. Uh, a new Dragon Quest monsters game called Super Light is

01:32:30.960 --> 01:32:36.000
also on the way to iOS and Android. Um, you know, a lot of people remember Dragon Quest here in

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:41.360
America. Of course we got it as Dragon Warrior, but a lot of people remember, uh, speaking of

01:32:41.360 --> 01:32:46.160
magazines, which was kind of the theme of the show earlier. Uh, I remember the Nintendo power,

01:32:46.160 --> 01:32:49.680
you got the Dragon Warrior guide with it, right? Or was that when you bought the game,

01:32:49.680 --> 01:32:53.200
you got it with either the game or you got it with a magazine, probably both. I think it's

01:32:53.200 --> 01:32:56.720
a magazine. Yeah. You got that Dragon Warrior guide. And so I know a lot of people like really

01:32:56.720 --> 01:33:00.320
knew that game. So I think there'll be some people to kind of jump on it when it's re-released

01:33:00.320 --> 01:33:06.240
for, um, iOS later this year. We'll see. But you know, all eight, that's pretty,

01:33:06.240 --> 01:33:09.760
that's pretty crazy. I mean, Dragon Quest eight was a PlayStation two game.

01:33:09.760 --> 01:33:13.200
It was really good too. It was one of my favorites in the whole series. Uh,

01:33:13.200 --> 01:33:17.360
speaking of big Square Enix properties going to mobile, I don't know if you guys heard this,

01:33:17.360 --> 01:33:22.640
um, Final Fantasy six confirmed it will be coming to iOS and Android this year.

01:33:22.640 --> 01:33:26.400
And, uh, I seem to remember when Final Fantasy five came out earlier this year,

01:33:26.400 --> 01:33:30.880
I remember thinking like, well, this is, this is testing the waters for this, uh,

01:33:30.880 --> 01:33:36.400
Final Fantasy six will be the next big one. And sure enough here it is. So, um, they've said in

01:33:36.400 --> 01:33:40.240
regards to Final Fantasy six, the battle systems have been altered for the other

01:33:40.240 --> 01:33:46.560
mobile remakes and Final Fantasy and Final Fantasy six will be the same. Uh, so yeah,

01:33:46.560 --> 01:33:50.160
I guess on the mobile devices, the battle systems have been adjusted. You won't have to do as much

01:33:50.160 --> 01:33:54.480
grinding and fighting as much. You can just enjoy the game straight up. You won't be able to,

01:33:54.480 --> 01:33:58.880
you won't have to do one, two step, Oh, random battle. Some, some people that's going to rub

01:33:58.880 --> 01:34:04.320
some people the wrong way. I'm very curious to see how Sabin's moves transfer over. Like,

01:34:04.320 --> 01:34:08.320
does that mean you're going to have to just kind of use your finger to draw the different patterns?

01:34:08.320 --> 01:34:11.680
Cause he was the one, like you actually do quarter circle forward to have him do like

01:34:11.680 --> 01:34:15.520
a big fireball and stuff. Remember that Final Fantasy six, like you actually did controller

01:34:15.520 --> 01:34:19.840
movements to get him to do things where you select what it is. Yeah. I don't know. As I'm

01:34:19.840 --> 01:34:25.360
very curious to see how some of that translates over. Um, and also, you know, there was a big

01:34:25.360 --> 01:34:29.920
conversation on this going on on Twitter this week. You know, I talk a lot with like, you know,

01:34:29.920 --> 01:34:34.800
spike from gamebuoy.org on Twitter throughout the week. And he's kind of not happy to hear

01:34:34.800 --> 01:34:40.960
this news because Final Fantasy five, let's just say cut a few corners when it came to like art

01:34:40.960 --> 01:34:46.160
assets, especially. And in my opinion, the game looks very outsourced in some places, you know,

01:34:46.160 --> 01:34:50.880
the art assets aren't, you know, as good as they could be and so on. So there's a little bit of

01:34:50.880 --> 01:34:56.640
concern out there that like, you know, this translation is probably not going to be very good

01:34:56.640 --> 01:35:00.640
and it's definitely going to be just kind of a cash in. Um, I know this is one of my very

01:35:00.640 --> 01:35:05.040
favorites in the entire series. Uh, dark soccer, what do you think about this Final Fantasy six

01:35:05.040 --> 01:35:12.240
coming to iPhone and, uh, Android? I know you, uh, you like this game a lot. Yeah. I love the game,

01:35:12.240 --> 01:35:19.040
but to be honest, I have the cartridge and I have the PlayStation version. So it's sort of like,

01:35:19.040 --> 01:35:24.640
I don't need it. It's sometimes it's still fun to see your old games get remade though. I mean,

01:35:24.640 --> 01:35:28.640
when they're good remakes, right? Like a lot of people, I haven't played it yet, but I'm hearing

01:35:28.640 --> 01:35:33.200
Wind Waker. I'm hearing amazing things about that. You know, I'm actually getting more to the point

01:35:33.200 --> 01:35:39.040
where the only thing that I play on my iPhone is freaking bejeweled or puzzle games. And if I'm

01:35:39.040 --> 01:35:44.560
wanting to play a like, and this is quoting fingers, legit game, I'm going to play on my

01:35:44.560 --> 01:35:49.280
three DS or I'm gonna play on my PC. So, well, speaking of three DS, uh, Alan alchemy in our

01:35:49.280 --> 01:35:54.880
chat room says, I want a proper Final Fantasy five and Final Fantasy six DS or three DS remake.

01:35:54.880 --> 01:35:59.440
God damn it. None of this iOS HD sprite crap. You know, I think that's where a lot of people

01:35:59.440 --> 01:36:04.480
are at is because you know, the 3d remake of Final Fantasy four and three was, was pretty good. So

01:36:04.480 --> 01:36:13.040
they, we were hoping to get the same treatment. I also, sorry, go ahead. Sorry. Okay, fine. I

01:36:13.040 --> 01:36:20.080
use the power of my boobs to go first. Um, I agree with Agdeft, I and Honda, but I want like a full

01:36:20.080 --> 01:36:24.720
HD version of I Honda and I want them to do a frequent sequel. Well, keep on wishing. I know,

01:36:24.720 --> 01:36:29.680
I know, but I love that game. I would settle for like a Final Fantasy four version where they did

01:36:29.680 --> 01:36:34.480
the after years or whatever, or Final Fantasy six. Oh, that is also coming as Final Fantasy

01:36:34.480 --> 01:36:38.480
four. The after years is also coming to iOS and Android. That was, that was in one of those news

01:36:38.480 --> 01:36:44.240
stories somewhere I would re I'd like Final Fantasy 60 after years or that would be really

01:36:44.240 --> 01:36:49.280
cool to see like a, a sequel to one of the older Final Fantasy games in that way after years wasn't

01:36:49.280 --> 01:36:53.680
terrible, but you know, I think the PSP was probably the best version of that, which so many

01:36:53.680 --> 01:37:00.240
people never even saw it. Yeah. So, all right. Uh, let's move on. Uh, we did the classic game

01:37:00.240 --> 01:37:06.320
of the week. I think we are. It's that time. We've just been talking about some classics like

01:37:07.120 --> 01:37:12.400
dragon quest and final fantasy six and so forth. So dark soccer is going to dive into the gaming

01:37:12.400 --> 01:37:16.640
vault and I think it's a non RPG she picked this week. This one may as well be for Bobby. Like you

01:37:16.640 --> 01:37:21.840
were telling me offline earlier. Yeah. I actually asked dark soccer. I was like, were you picking

01:37:21.840 --> 01:37:26.400
this to troll certain chatters of ours? And she's like, no. And I'm like, but you do realize dot,

01:37:26.400 --> 01:37:31.600
dot, dot. And she's like, Oh yeah. It's like, Oh, Oh, all right. Well enough teasing. What is

01:37:31.600 --> 01:37:37.600
the classic game of the week this week? The classic game of the week is marathon marathon

01:37:37.600 --> 01:37:43.120
was the first person shooter done by bungee and it came out in 1994 for the Macintosh.

01:37:43.120 --> 01:37:46.640
People who say that there's not games for the Mac. Look, there was a game,

01:37:47.200 --> 01:37:56.160
one game. Congrats. You've got that crystal quest. I know. I know. Um, anyway, the, um,

01:37:56.160 --> 01:38:02.640
the game was, um, bungee's second FPS game. The first was pathways into darkness. Um,

01:38:02.640 --> 01:38:09.280
and the game basically was sort of, I wouldn't say biting on doom, but it was seen as, um,

01:38:09.280 --> 01:38:18.800
the Mac counterpart to doom. So, um, and of course this game didn't get a, a PC version until 1995.

01:38:18.800 --> 01:38:24.240
So marathon was very, uh, action oriented, uh, very similar to doom and how it played.

01:38:24.240 --> 01:38:28.480
It had a multiplayer deathmatch mode. You could have up to eight players on separate machines,

01:38:29.440 --> 01:38:36.400
um, on the same land. So it was basically like, we love you Mac players. Here you go.

01:38:37.440 --> 01:38:43.760
And of course it also had sequels. It had marathon two and marathon infinity. Um, and then, um, in

01:38:43.760 --> 01:38:51.040
1996 bungee completed super marathon, which was a marathon marathon two that was on the Bondi Pippin.

01:38:51.360 --> 01:38:55.360
Um, so I'm not going to go into too much about the game itself because

01:38:56.400 --> 01:39:03.520
the story on it is really freaking in depth. I mean, we're talking a super, super rich plot

01:39:04.480 --> 01:39:10.880
and, you know, story twists and a lot of things that I think that sort of become a future nod to,

01:39:10.880 --> 01:39:17.600
um, franchises like Halo, you know, where it's that sci-fi element. You're dealing with outer space.

01:39:18.160 --> 01:39:25.680
You have, uh, AIs going on new issues with AIs and I'm not going to, uh, go too much into that.

01:39:26.720 --> 01:39:34.000
But, um, the important thing that I think about, uh, this one is that the fact that number one,

01:39:34.560 --> 01:39:41.040
yeah, it was on the Mac. I mean, you had very few games, I think, cause this was right when

01:39:41.040 --> 01:39:46.000
the transition, it used to be that, you know, a lot of your, you need to have load runner and

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:50.560
all of your old, uh, Apple IIe games. And you had like the early Mac games, like all your Carmen

01:39:50.560 --> 01:39:56.880
San Diego stuff and different ones. You didn't have like dedicated adult, I'd say adult themed

01:39:56.880 --> 01:40:02.320
games. And this one I thought was supposed to be, uh, pretty, it was pretty big news at the time.

01:40:03.440 --> 01:40:11.200
So it is in a semi 3d rendered world. Um, it's all, you know, texture mapped and dynamic lit

01:40:11.200 --> 01:40:16.400
and everything. Um, it has an option called a free look where you can actually look around the

01:40:16.400 --> 01:40:22.480
character and you can use your mouse to switch weapons. And, uh, it meant that you could look

01:40:22.480 --> 01:40:29.040
down, you could, you know, move around, you could look around corners. Um, and the big thing that

01:40:29.040 --> 01:40:34.720
it was, you know, it was level oriented. Let's kill enemies, avoid obstacles, the usual type of

01:40:34.720 --> 01:40:41.280
FPS stuff. And then, um, to advance to your next level, you had to, uh, find a terminal that your

01:40:41.280 --> 01:40:48.640
AI could teleport you from. So it had different objectives that you had to, um, participate in,

01:40:48.640 --> 01:40:54.320
in the game, including your puzzles. Um, one level didn't have oxygen in it, so you had to complete

01:40:54.320 --> 01:41:00.160
it before asphyxiating. And you had like motion sensors that you'd have to use different weapons.

01:41:00.160 --> 01:41:05.200
Your weapons were, uh, you had to fist a pistol, assault rifle, rocket launcher, a flamethrower

01:41:05.200 --> 01:41:11.600
that wouldn't kill everything, um, a fusion gun, and then you had, uh, this weird alien weapon.

01:41:11.600 --> 01:41:16.000
So that's another thing that came up in Halo, you know, where you could pick up the alien's weapons.

01:41:17.440 --> 01:41:24.240
Um, like I said, also you have a multiplayer version where it was a death match. We had up to

01:41:24.240 --> 01:41:31.120
eight people, um, on a land game. And, uh, it was basically go around, beat each other up until one's

01:41:31.120 --> 01:41:37.760
left. Um, Macworld gave, gave this, uh, game, um, the Game Hall of Fame award for best network game

01:41:37.760 --> 01:41:46.480
of 1995. And, um, Bungie wanted to add more scenarios to it, but did not. They, um, were, uh,

01:41:46.480 --> 01:41:51.920
it looks like they were trying to incorporate them into Marathon too. So, I mean, Marathon is

01:41:51.920 --> 01:41:59.760
basically the big Mac enthusiast game. It started, I think, the realm of serious gaming on Mac.

01:42:00.640 --> 01:42:07.040
You know, for everyone who says, yeah, Macs don't have games, this was, I think, the first attempt to

01:42:07.040 --> 01:42:15.360
really reach out to that market. You know, it ended up being so popular that they did end up

01:42:15.360 --> 01:42:22.480
putting it out on PC later on with a trilogy set. And they even, um, were supporting the Pippin,

01:42:22.480 --> 01:42:28.320
like I said earlier. So, um, that, that YouTube ran out. So I'm going to switch to this, uh, from

01:42:28.320 --> 01:42:37.280
the Xbox 360 remake here real quick. This is from Durin Dow. Well, at any rate, um, there were

01:42:37.280 --> 01:42:44.880
concepts of the, um, AI working that were taken from Marathon that were, as I said, later incorporated

01:42:44.960 --> 01:42:50.720
into the Halo series. And now there is also a version that came out in 2011 that is a port of

01:42:50.720 --> 01:42:57.520
Marathon for the iPad that is, uh, it was released for free. So if you want this and you have an iPad,

01:42:57.520 --> 01:43:04.640
you can definitely go play it. There's also, um, you can get the Aleph 1, um, engine. Um, it's at the

01:43:04.640 --> 01:43:12.480
Marathon open source project. And, uh, there is a, a site called the Trilogy release that has, uh,

01:43:12.480 --> 01:43:21.840
downloadable copies of Marathon and the M1A1. So you can go play it. All right. That's it then,

01:43:21.840 --> 01:43:27.360
your classic end of the week Marathon. Whereas Bobby keeps yelling in chat, Halo Zero,

01:43:27.360 --> 01:43:31.200
which I suppose is one way of looking at it. I mean, in a way without this, you wouldn't have

01:43:31.200 --> 01:43:35.920
Halo. As I think a lot of the inspiration for Halo came to this. So, so Bobby, it's not necessarily

01:43:35.920 --> 01:43:45.920
a troll on my part. It's, it's a, uh, I'd have to say a legitimate, uh, homage to your idea.

01:43:45.920 --> 01:43:49.920
There you go. In other words, that that's, that's the, that's as much as you're gonna get.

01:43:49.920 --> 01:43:51.680
That's as much bungee as you're getting from me.

01:43:52.640 --> 01:43:55.280
There you go. You take what you get and you like it. All right.

01:43:55.280 --> 01:43:56.160
You eat your peas.

01:43:58.080 --> 01:43:59.440
All right. There it is. Your classic end of the week.

01:43:59.440 --> 01:44:01.040
I better not catch you feeding it to the dog.

01:44:01.040 --> 01:44:03.920
I just wanted to say though, when you were talking about like Macintosh games,

01:44:03.920 --> 01:44:08.160
my mind does go to some stuff I was playing like way back in the black and white Macintosh days.

01:44:08.160 --> 01:44:13.520
And, uh, I, I remember crystal quest was a huge one, which they, they did on three 60 later on

01:44:13.520 --> 01:44:16.640
that we should do that as classic game of the week one week. Cause I love that game.

01:44:16.640 --> 01:44:21.680
Uh, and then the other one that my good friend growing up, I had to search for this one. I

01:44:21.680 --> 01:44:27.440
remember it. Dark castle was a great Macintosh game back in the day. If you've never checked

01:44:27.440 --> 01:44:31.040
that out, just, just saying like, I know, I know what you're talking about is you're talking about

01:44:31.040 --> 01:44:36.640
like, you know, a different era of Macintosh sorta, but you know, just right about when

01:44:36.640 --> 01:44:42.240
PC really, really was picking up, you know, when the windows format, cause I think this was right

01:44:42.240 --> 01:44:50.800
around the windows 95 era. So we're looking at the, the big jump from Mac to PC as far as, uh,

01:44:53.280 --> 01:44:59.360
I'd say the everyday user. So Bobby black Wolf in our chat room says I approve of this classic game

01:44:59.360 --> 01:45:04.640
of the week hearts and he is eating his piece. Good, good boy. All right. And you can have a

01:45:04.640 --> 01:45:10.320
fudge pop when you're done. Dungeon Buster in chat, uh, says that, uh, reminds us you can play

01:45:10.320 --> 01:45:16.080
the marathon trilogy on PCs for free. Thanks to bungee. It's at source dot bungee.org. So no

01:45:16.080 --> 01:45:19.680
excuse for you to not check out this game of the week. And I'm going to see if it's actually still

01:45:19.680 --> 01:45:24.640
free on iPad. Nice. All right. There you go. All right. We are definitely running long for this

01:45:24.640 --> 01:45:29.200
first out of the show. So let's take a break guys. When we come back, we will have more orange

01:45:29.200 --> 01:45:33.840
launch radio, rapid fire news, Google question of the week, your emails, phone calls, and plenty

01:45:33.840 --> 01:45:45.120
more. When we come back with more of orange launch radio right after this. Welcome back everybody to

01:45:45.120 --> 01:45:55.520
orange lounge radio episode number 523 already in progress here on October the 13th of 2013. Wow.

01:45:55.520 --> 01:46:00.320
Halloween is sneaking up on us fast. I don't know if you guys have any plans. Uh, Loki is,

01:46:00.320 --> 01:46:04.400
is Josh at about that age where you actually do stuff for Halloween or he still got another year

01:46:04.400 --> 01:46:09.040
or two. Yeah. Usually just around the block. That's a lot of candy you can get for yourself

01:46:09.040 --> 01:46:13.120
to eat, huh? Uh, you know, we give them a little bit of it, but yeah, even last year we ended up

01:46:13.120 --> 01:46:19.520
throwing away most of it. Oh no. Well, it's just like garbage. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, anyway,

01:46:19.520 --> 01:46:24.480
uh, so during the break here, uh, he's going to be a firework. He's going to be a firework for

01:46:24.480 --> 01:46:29.360
Halloween. So what do you want it to be? You want it to be a fireworks. So we're like, okay.

01:46:30.320 --> 01:46:35.920
Becky convinced Julian to dress up as captain Kirk. Oh, that's amazing. He's going to be

01:46:35.920 --> 01:46:39.440
new Kirk or old Kirk. New Kirk. Okay. He's going to be a little heartbreaker.

01:46:40.080 --> 01:46:44.160
That is so funny. That's going to be adorable. Julian's what? Six, seven. Yeah. Last year he

01:46:44.160 --> 01:46:52.080
was iron man. Oh my gosh. All right. Um, one of my friends is, uh, I don't know how much about this.

01:46:52.080 --> 01:46:55.840
I should say on air, but one of my friends is having a party and the whole theme about it is,

01:46:55.840 --> 01:47:01.600
uh, internet memes. So I have to figure out which one I'm going to do. And I'm pretty sure I know,

01:47:01.600 --> 01:47:05.040
but I don't want to say on air cause I know this person listens to the show and I want them to be

01:47:05.040 --> 01:47:08.560
surprised, but uh, yeah, I'm looking, I'm so looking forward to seeing the costumes that come

01:47:08.560 --> 01:47:12.560
out of this. It'll be fun. It's going to be a lot of fun. And the, the, the people that this,

01:47:12.560 --> 01:47:17.680
this party will attract are all very like people that will like be really into it. Like, you know,

01:47:17.680 --> 01:47:23.840
so I'm excited about it. All right. Um, let's see. Uh, I wanted to say during the break there,

01:47:23.840 --> 01:47:28.800
I actually went on to Kickstarter and put my money down for that a retro magazine. So, uh,

01:47:28.800 --> 01:47:33.440
cause if I don't do it now, I'll forget. Cause I forgot for Mighty number nine. I never ended up

01:47:33.440 --> 01:47:37.280
contributing to that. And I forgot for something else too. I was going to download or I was going

01:47:37.280 --> 01:47:40.720
to contribute to recently. I think it was the, I think it was the, um, well, I think it's coming

01:47:40.720 --> 01:47:44.400
up in rapid fire news. Is it, let me, let me peek real quick. Oh yeah. It is coming up. I'll tell

01:47:44.400 --> 01:47:50.240
you in a minute here. Uh, but yeah, uh, so I wanted to tease everybody. I wanted to remember.

01:47:50.240 --> 01:47:54.800
So I did the donation during the break here. So, uh, I hope it gets funded so I can get some

01:47:54.800 --> 01:48:01.840
magazines. We get times. All right. Uh, let's just, I, I, I, I want him to hire me. You should

01:48:01.840 --> 01:48:07.520
write a letter. You never know. So, all right. Um, I saw another podcaster on the list. Act

01:48:07.520 --> 01:48:13.760
deaf. Do you know what? I don't think Rob could be courage wolf. Rob would make a good moon moon.

01:48:14.640 --> 01:48:20.000
What? I don't know what mem you're referencing there. You haven't seen moon moon. It's this

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:26.880
derpy wolf picture. No, no, it's pretty funny. Just look up moon moon. All right. I will. I will.

01:48:26.880 --> 01:48:33.040
All right. Uh, like scumbag Steve. Funny you mentioned that because I told, I told Alan,

01:48:33.040 --> 01:48:36.480
that's what he should be. And he really took offense to that. And I'm, but I'm like, but,

01:48:36.480 --> 01:48:42.240
but like you're tall and like, cause I don't know half of them, half the name,

01:48:42.240 --> 01:48:48.480
name, the names of them out there. Um, but maybe like, was it that guy that's high or whatever

01:48:48.480 --> 01:48:55.200
that comes to the real, you know, the. Epiphany guy. I forget what the Kiana Reeves, not the

01:48:55.200 --> 01:48:59.600
Kiana Reeves guy. There's, there's one. It's like a guy at a concert or like a rave or something

01:48:59.600 --> 01:49:03.520
like that. And he's just kind of standing there like high looking and I don't know.

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:08.720
You need to go to know your mem.com and find it on there. Well, the whole website about it.

01:49:08.720 --> 01:49:12.080
That's the problem is I don't know what it's called. So it'd be kind of hard to look it up.

01:49:13.040 --> 01:49:17.760
Whatever. It's, it's no big deal. All right. Uh, let's move on. Uh, rapid fire news. Uh,

01:49:17.760 --> 01:49:21.840
talk about quickly what's going on in the gaming world. Loki. So the first piece of DLC for saints

01:49:21.840 --> 01:49:31.040
row four comes out on October 22nd, North America, October 23rd in the UK. Um, and it's the answer

01:49:31.040 --> 01:49:37.120
to the dominatrix DLC member eight dominatrix was going to be what saints row four was originally

01:49:37.120 --> 01:49:42.000
their plan on doing this standalone expansion for saints for the third is going to have this,

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:47.440
um, it's basically an alternate storyline to what saints row four is. So includes an alternate

01:49:47.440 --> 01:49:53.440
zen invasion storyline with the saints trapped in a virtual world run by an AI program known as the

01:49:53.440 --> 01:49:59.920
dominatrix. And they have to survive, I guess, against a bunch of sex workers and gimps and stuff

01:49:59.920 --> 01:50:06.400
in the game. So, um, only a game like saints row. Can you be, I guess it's going to have new

01:50:06.400 --> 01:50:12.960
weapons, enemies, allies, and they said missions and a behind the scenes commentary, taking what

01:50:12.960 --> 01:50:19.120
I learned from saints row, the third, and to all those that have saints row four, I caution you

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:24.640
wait until the reviews come out before you decide to buy this DLC, especially if you decide to buy

01:50:24.640 --> 01:50:30.000
a season pass because the season passes for two pieces of DLC. Cause if it's anything that saints

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:35.680
row the third, those pieces of DLC were 30 minutes long and they were crap. You played them once

01:50:35.680 --> 01:50:39.200
there's like four missions and you're done with them and you're just like, why the fuck did I

01:50:39.200 --> 01:50:46.160
just spend money on that? So take the time to read the reviews on the DLC before you purchase it,

01:50:46.160 --> 01:50:51.520
because that's what I'm going to do because I've gotten screwed multiple times by saints row the

01:50:51.520 --> 01:51:00.560
third. So just a fair warning. And yes, it will be, I think $7 for the DLC. Yeah, $7. So cool.

01:51:02.560 --> 01:51:06.720
If you want to get an Xbox 360 and haven't done so yet, there are going to be some

01:51:06.720 --> 01:51:12.000
holiday bundles and then they are launching to believe today. And those holiday bundles are

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:16.800
going to net you not only game systems, but two free games with each one. So for example,

01:51:16.880 --> 01:51:24.800
they have a 200 for $299, a 250 gigabyte system with halo four and tomb Raider,

01:51:24.800 --> 01:51:28.480
a four gigabyte system with connect with connect sports season two and connect vendors. Well,

01:51:28.480 --> 01:51:32.800
that's technically one free game because connect ventures comes with connect, just saying. And

01:51:32.800 --> 01:51:40.720
then of course also a three 99 bundle for 250 gigabyte system with connect and forza horizon,

01:51:40.720 --> 01:51:48.960
as well as connect sports season two. And actually, you know what? I don't even know

01:51:48.960 --> 01:51:55.120
if that's season two and looking at the picture now. I think that might be the connect sports

01:51:55.120 --> 01:52:04.080
season. I think it's both season one and season two. Let me see here real quick. I need to get

01:52:04.080 --> 01:52:08.720
better picture of this. That's not season two. At least that's what it says on a major Nelson site,

01:52:08.720 --> 01:52:13.040
but it doesn't look like the boxer does not look right. I think he's full of shit.

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:19.280
That's just me. Anyways, so yeah, that's going to be coming out. And so look forward to those.

01:52:20.240 --> 01:52:28.160
Also, I guess that is season two. Now that I look at the picture. All right, whatever. Also,

01:52:29.600 --> 01:52:35.200
Ubisoft has revealed the Assassin's Creed four season pass content. And unlike this time around,

01:52:35.200 --> 01:52:42.320
we don't get an evil Washington. Instead, we get freedom cry, a nine mission single player

01:52:42.320 --> 01:52:49.920
campaign starting or starting a new protagonist, Edward Kenway's first mate, let's say aid whale.

01:52:50.560 --> 01:53:01.840
And he is an escaped slave. So that's going to be coming, I guess, 1999 for the season pass.

01:53:01.840 --> 01:53:10.800
Cool. And they have a, an exclusive crack and ship pack. So you can, do you get to

01:53:10.800 --> 01:53:14.560
yell release the cracker? Yes, you do. You get the ring. Yes. You get the yell that, you know,

01:53:15.680 --> 01:53:19.840
that's what it's all about. That's what it's all about. What about the whole fact that the

01:53:19.840 --> 01:53:24.640
Assassin's Creed DLC is not coming to Wii U. What do you think about that? That was like,

01:53:24.640 --> 01:53:28.880
I don't really think anything about it because it doesn't seem like a lot of DLC comes to

01:53:28.880 --> 01:53:34.560
Wii U. What is up with that? Because it's like, okay, because the third money to make it three

01:53:34.560 --> 01:53:38.560
Assassin's Creed three had DLC for it. So I don't understand why it's not coming to

01:53:38.560 --> 01:53:42.240
and like Mass Effect didn't have it and all these other games aren't doing it. And I'm just kind of

01:53:42.240 --> 01:53:46.320
like, the only thing I can think of is that there's some must be some sort of funky

01:53:46.320 --> 01:53:50.800
infrastructure that they have to put in there. Maybe they have to tweak some stuff. It's just

01:53:50.800 --> 01:53:57.040
my, the tinfoil hat guy in me. And, you know, judge me all you want, but I am convinced that

01:53:57.040 --> 01:54:02.400
there is something in Nintendo's online infrastructure that is not conducive to the

01:54:02.400 --> 01:54:08.400
DLC thing like Sony and Microsoft. I don't know what it is. Maybe it's the cut that they take

01:54:08.400 --> 01:54:14.560
or something, or maybe it's like, you know, well, I would think even if the cut wasn't that good,

01:54:14.560 --> 01:54:18.640
it's still thinking you would want to do that. Maybe it's some sort of exclusive, I don't know,

01:54:18.640 --> 01:54:22.560
I don't know what it is, but yeah, I know a lot of games come out for the Wii U and they don't

01:54:22.560 --> 01:54:26.320
have DLC packed in there. I don't think it's the cut or anything, or it wouldn't be so appealing

01:54:26.320 --> 01:54:28.960
to indie developers, though. Like, I almost wonder if it's something about the process.

01:54:28.960 --> 01:54:31.920
But indie developers don't do DLC for their games, usually.

01:54:31.920 --> 01:54:37.520
True, true. Alright, anyhow, so the tinfoil speculation continues all around the internet.

01:54:37.520 --> 01:54:42.320
Meanwhile, a game that's coming out for the Xbox One that some people are looking forward to,

01:54:42.320 --> 01:54:47.920
Killer Instinct. Killer Instinct will be doing their balance updates on the fly. In other words,

01:54:47.920 --> 01:54:51.200
they're talking about, they're talking about doing the cloud. They're talking about their updating

01:54:51.200 --> 01:54:54.720
immediately through the cloud, and all the variables that talk about how a character

01:54:54.720 --> 01:54:58.720
behaves are going to exist in the cloud, and this is according to producer Torin Rettig,

01:54:58.720 --> 01:55:03.360
talking to Game Informer. Without having to content update or patch the game at all,

01:55:03.360 --> 01:55:07.440
we can just go in on the cloud and tweak these variables without the player having to know.

01:55:07.440 --> 01:55:11.520
Our vision is for it all to be behind the scenes, so it won't require any official title update

01:55:11.520 --> 01:55:15.040
download. Basically, the game checks for the latest version of the gameplay's parameters

01:55:15.040 --> 01:55:19.600
and automatically updates if it's a new version. No download or confirmation dialogue necessary,

01:55:19.600 --> 01:55:24.080
and the files themselves are so small, you'll never notice the difference. So what I'm hearing

01:55:24.080 --> 01:55:29.760
is that it is patching. They're just really small files, so like they're patches, but they're not

01:55:29.760 --> 01:55:34.480
like PlayStation patches that take like an hour, you know? That's fine if they're doing that,

01:55:34.480 --> 01:55:38.960
and they did that even with like some Xbox games got around that where they could tweak stuff.

01:55:38.960 --> 01:55:44.720
I remember one of the games we actually talked to people or talked to a developer at E3 about was

01:55:44.720 --> 01:55:51.040
that Madballs Babbo Invasion game, remember that? And they were talking about how they could tweak

01:55:51.040 --> 01:55:56.480
everything via, you know, just basically having the game be online, they can tweak all the

01:55:56.480 --> 01:56:01.840
variables. I get the idea about tweaking things like in the cloud, so to speak, like a lot of MMOs

01:56:01.840 --> 01:56:05.680
do this all the time. We call them hot fixes in World of Warcraft and so forth, but when I hear

01:56:05.680 --> 01:56:10.080
like, well, it's tweaked in the cloud, but then there actually are small patches, but it's done

01:56:10.080 --> 01:56:14.960
in the cloud. I'm like, you use that word cloud, and I don't think it means what you think it means.

01:56:14.960 --> 01:56:18.720
You don't think you know what it means. I don't think it means what you think it means. Anyway.

01:56:18.720 --> 01:56:23.120
Just call it the internet. It's the fucking internet. It's not a cloud. It's the internet.

01:56:23.120 --> 01:56:33.120
The internet is infrastructure. It's not the cloud because then you get people making ridiculous

01:56:33.120 --> 01:56:36.880
like comparisons to clouds. Like, oh, it's raining. It's stormy in the cloud.

01:56:37.520 --> 01:56:42.000
All right. Here's the other Kickstarter I teased earlier that I forgot to back and the deadline

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:47.920
has passed. It's River City Ransom Underground. River City Ransom Underground did make its funding

01:56:47.920 --> 01:56:53.920
this week. They raised 180,000 Canadian dollars and that will ensure that they will be able to

01:56:53.920 --> 01:57:00.400
get the game onto the PC. So yeah, there it goes. So congratulations to them. Look forward to being

01:57:00.400 --> 01:57:06.320
able to play the game. And lastly, here's the game I am very excited about on the 3DS. I am

01:57:06.320 --> 01:57:10.560
more excited about this game than Pokemon. Sorry about it, but this is far more important than

01:57:10.560 --> 01:57:16.080
Pokemon X and Y. I don't care if you're going to judge me for that because this is Zelda,

01:57:16.080 --> 01:57:21.040
A Link Between Worlds. I am very excited about this. There was a new trailer shown this week

01:57:21.040 --> 01:57:26.800
that actually shows that some of the ways that you have, or you have that link between worlds,

01:57:26.800 --> 01:57:31.440
because obviously in the teaser logo, you have like the light Triforce and the dark Triforce.

01:57:31.440 --> 01:57:35.520
Well, in this new teaser, you see Link literally slipping through cracks. Cause you know,

01:57:35.520 --> 01:57:39.760
it's that whole thing where he can kind of put, press himself up against a wall like paper.

01:57:39.760 --> 01:57:45.680
And he goes from high rule to low rule is the name of the other world. It seems like, get it

01:57:45.680 --> 01:57:52.320
high, low, ah, her anyhow, whatever, uh, as long as the game's good, I don't care what they call

01:57:52.320 --> 01:57:57.600
the world. Uh, so there it is. And uh, I guess there is a new villain in the game too, but I

01:57:57.600 --> 01:58:02.320
kind of go, sure. There's a new villain. Sure. It's a new villain. It'll fucking be Ganon

01:58:03.840 --> 01:58:08.000
somehow or something controlled by Ganon or whatever. But anyhow, the release date of the

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:14.000
game, November 22nd, man, that makes me want to bust out my link to the past cartridge, right?

01:58:14.720 --> 01:58:19.280
I know just because I love, I love the last battle in that game. Yeah. I just love that

01:58:19.280 --> 01:58:22.720
ending. That's like, I haven't played through that game in a very long time.

01:58:25.120 --> 01:58:30.720
A little bit. So anyway, uh, dark soccer, what do you have? I don't know. And we're not even

01:58:30.720 --> 01:58:37.520
talking about that in the chat room. We're talking about, uh, Strider, whatever Strider.

01:58:37.520 --> 01:58:42.720
Yo, it's always about other topics than what we're actually talking about on here. Strider.

01:58:42.720 --> 01:58:48.720
Okay. So, um, the Double Fine is going to be hosting the day of the devs on November 2nd.

01:58:49.360 --> 01:58:55.440
Um, it is with the help of I am 8-bit. It is free to the public and it's an event that will let

01:58:55.440 --> 01:59:01.360
the public basically meet the folks at Double Fine and, um, some other indie developers and

01:59:01.360 --> 01:59:07.120
let them check out some of the Kickstarter, uh, games like, uh, Broken Age and another

01:59:07.200 --> 01:59:13.440
untitled, uh, game. And so it's basically just hang out with us, play some games. We're cool

01:59:13.440 --> 01:59:21.760
people. You like us. So hurry for Double Fine. And then, um, Ed Boon, who, um, developed Injustice

01:59:21.760 --> 01:59:27.360
and he was our Mortal Kombat dude, he basically said on Twitter that he wanted to create a Mortal

01:59:27.360 --> 01:59:32.080
Kombat versus Street Fighter, um, and that he's reached out to Capcom to see if they would be

01:59:32.080 --> 01:59:36.480
interested, but they have not replied yet. I don't know that that would be something that

01:59:37.600 --> 01:59:40.800
Capcom would go for. They would do it because, I mean, if they do it, they're the same route as

01:59:40.800 --> 01:59:45.280
they did like with Injustice, well not Injustice, but like, Mortal Kombat versus DC where it's kind

01:59:45.280 --> 01:59:49.760
of pussified where they just, you know, make it teen rated and not so violent, then they could

01:59:49.760 --> 01:59:53.840
probably get away with it because I think the whole thing was, well, we don't want to have,

01:59:53.840 --> 01:59:58.480
you know, these guys doing fatalities on, you know, Street Fighter characters or even I think

01:59:58.480 --> 02:00:02.240
DC does the same thing. We don't want, we don't want Scorpion ripping the head off of Superman

02:00:03.120 --> 02:00:10.560
because that's just not realistic. I still thought it was funny that they put in the original Joker

02:00:10.560 --> 02:00:16.080
fatality later on, the full thing. Yeah. That was pretty cool. So, um, and then something that a

02:00:16.080 --> 02:00:21.840
lot of people are excited for is that the Final Fantasy X and X-2 HD remasters are going to be

02:00:21.840 --> 02:00:30.640
out in Japan in December. They will be out for a Vita and PS3 and the date for release is December

02:00:30.640 --> 02:00:35.520
26th. So I'm hoping that we're going to get it soon after over here in the US.

02:00:37.120 --> 02:00:42.640
Yay. Yay. There was much rejoicing. That's the only upcoming game that I had tentative for this year

02:00:42.640 --> 02:00:48.560
that I still don't know what the date is. I keep asking too. Yeah. I would assume it'd have to be,

02:00:48.560 --> 02:00:54.400
assuming they're localizing it around the same time as the current development,

02:00:54.400 --> 02:01:02.960
then I would assume sometime in January, February. Alrighty. I, yeah, I really want,

02:01:02.960 --> 02:01:06.720
I'm really looking forward to those games, but I'm okay if it takes until after the holidays to

02:01:06.720 --> 02:01:11.120
finish it. Cause I still didn't even play through Kingdom Hearts. Final Fantasy XIV derailed all

02:01:11.120 --> 02:01:16.080
my gaming stuff. Like I got to get back on board with the other stuff. Rob, you still have to play

02:01:16.080 --> 02:01:22.400
XIV with me. Make me. No, I'm just kidding. Alan can run dungeons now too. So I'm trying to get

02:01:22.400 --> 02:01:25.360
him up to speed and then maybe we can all do stuff. I'll make you a sandwich if you play.

02:01:25.360 --> 02:01:29.440
Cool. I love sandwiches. But not right now. Alright. Let's get to the FUGL question of the

02:01:29.440 --> 02:01:41.600
week you guys. Every week we ask a question of our Facebook and our Google Plus communities.

02:01:41.600 --> 02:01:45.920
You take those words and throw them together and you get FUGL. So it's time for the FUGL

02:01:45.920 --> 02:01:50.800
question of the week. And that question is knowing the interview we had earlier tonight,

02:01:50.800 --> 02:01:54.960
we kind of stuck with the theme here. And the question is, do you currently, or have you in

02:01:54.960 --> 02:02:00.240
the past subscribed to any video game magazines? Which ones? Do you have a particularly favorite

02:02:00.240 --> 02:02:05.440
issue? And, uh, yeah, so we got a lot of responses to this. I don't have time to read all these

02:02:05.440 --> 02:02:09.120
answers. I'm very sorry. So I'm going to really encourage you to go to our Facebook community

02:02:09.120 --> 02:02:13.600
at facebook.com slash orange launch radio and our Google Plus community to check out the answers.

02:02:13.600 --> 02:02:17.280
I'm going to try to read some of these and I'm going to try to pick names I don't see

02:02:17.280 --> 02:02:21.440
very often. Just, just to cycle through some different voices. I don't always see in chat

02:02:21.440 --> 02:02:26.720
or other places. Um, so starting with gaming nerd on Facebook says I used to be a subscriber

02:02:26.720 --> 02:02:32.400
to a number of magazines, including game pro EGM, Sega visions, game players, and game informer.

02:02:32.400 --> 02:02:36.560
I forgot about Sega visions, but yeah, that was a cool magazine. Um, I still have all of the

02:02:36.560 --> 02:02:42.720
issues collected in bins to take out and flip through whenever I feel a nostalgic rush. Um,

02:02:42.720 --> 02:02:48.480
let's see. Unfolded Raptor says I subscribed to Nintendo power and electronic gaming monthly

02:02:48.480 --> 02:02:53.360
and have kept every issue, but the story behind behind my favorite issue is interesting.

02:02:53.360 --> 02:02:59.360
In October, 2004 issue 183 of EGM, they interviewed a girl by the name of Rachel Moore,

02:02:59.360 --> 02:03:03.920
who is talking about horror games and wearing a Tony Hawk's underground shirt. About 2006,

02:03:03.920 --> 02:03:09.120
I discovered orange on radio randomly and started listening to you on my PSP. This got my interest

02:03:09.200 --> 02:03:13.200
started in gaming podcast. And eventually I wound up on all games.com, which is, you know,

02:03:13.200 --> 02:03:18.080
where we were previously, uh, and listen to both OLR and all games interactive then moved to dead

02:03:18.080 --> 02:03:22.320
pixel and spooky hour horror hour where Rachel Moore was a host. I didn't think much of it at

02:03:22.320 --> 02:03:25.920
the time, and I didn't put it all together until I was looking back at my old gaming magazines and

02:03:25.920 --> 02:03:30.080
had a holy shit moment because this girl I was listening to was way bigger than I thought. And

02:03:30.080 --> 02:03:35.440
I knew her before, even if I didn't realize it now it's kept in a safe place. Then imagine my shock

02:03:35.440 --> 02:03:39.920
when I heard OLR was moving to all games.com. It was amazing. And now we have VOG, but I love

02:03:39.920 --> 02:03:43.840
how everything worked together and everything was so connected. Life can be funny sometimes.

02:03:43.840 --> 02:03:47.920
That's very true. It's you never know where the people you might've seen in one place are going

02:03:47.920 --> 02:03:53.280
to end up. That's just, that's just true anywhere, you know, in, in anything, any industry, not just

02:03:53.280 --> 02:04:00.800
gaming. Um, Elliot B says I had a subscription to edge magazine for over a decade now, and it's

02:04:00.800 --> 02:04:04.880
still very much worth reading. Always has interesting features and stunning design,

02:04:04.880 --> 02:04:09.440
especially the gorgeous glossy covers. Though I sometimes miss the days when it was pretentious

02:04:09.440 --> 02:04:15.040
enough to refer to itself in third person. Uh, Amanda R replies and says, I subscribed to

02:04:15.040 --> 02:04:19.920
Nintendo power back in the day. It was really a great magazine. When Pokemon red and blue came

02:04:19.920 --> 02:04:25.280
out in the States, they had little tear out comic book size guides in every issue, uh, were

02:04:25.280 --> 02:04:29.520
incredibly helpful. And even before the game came out, they got us really hyped to play it. Yeah,

02:04:29.520 --> 02:04:34.080
we brought up the dragon warrior one too. And that, you know, that final fantasy,

02:04:34.080 --> 02:04:37.920
what else did they have? Those big strategy guides earthbound had a big one. You know,

02:04:37.920 --> 02:04:42.720
those all really got people hyped for those games. Uh, this was before the internet was really a

02:04:42.720 --> 02:04:46.800
thing and I'm not sure if there was a strategy guide out there. So the little guides were

02:04:46.800 --> 02:04:52.400
gold. Uh, James A replies and says, I have subscribed to game informer and Nintendo power.

02:04:52.400 --> 02:04:57.920
My favorite issue would have to be Nintendo power one 72 because they featured some envelope art

02:04:57.920 --> 02:05:04.000
that I submitted. It was the happiest moment of my young life. And lastly, we'll read an answer

02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:09.280
here from Veronica S who says, I used to subscribe to Nintendo power back in the game cube days,

02:05:09.280 --> 02:05:15.360
but I got tired of reading it. So I unsubscribed. Now I subscribe to Nintendo force, the all new

02:05:15.360 --> 02:05:21.440
spiritual successor to Nintendo power. Thank you guys for the answers. There were so many answers,

02:05:21.440 --> 02:05:25.920
um, that I just, you know, we were running a little long tonight because of, uh, we had a

02:05:25.920 --> 02:05:30.640
longer part eight and I than usual. So I don't have time to read all 20 plus responses on

02:05:30.640 --> 02:05:35.600
Facebook and then Google. So, uh, please check out what our listeners had to say. A lot of love

02:05:35.600 --> 02:05:39.680
for Nintendo power across the board. I noticed, which, um, you know, doesn't, doesn't surprise me

02:05:39.680 --> 02:05:44.160
one bit. That's certainly one that's near and dear to my heart. You know, I got, I got in trouble

02:05:44.160 --> 02:05:47.920
when I was in fourth grade over an issue of Nintendo power. Yeah. Cause I had it out in

02:05:47.920 --> 02:05:52.560
class and I was showing friends. It was, it was the controversial issue, uh, with Simon's quest

02:05:52.560 --> 02:05:55.920
on the cover. It was only like issue four or something, but you know, like parents were very

02:05:55.920 --> 02:06:01.680
upset that there was like skulls and, and, and imagery on the cover of the magazine like this.

02:06:01.680 --> 02:06:07.680
And I had one of the big guides for, um, Mario paint. Oh yeah. I remember that one. You had the,

02:06:07.680 --> 02:06:12.960
it had the songs in it. You could put in the songs. They had a bunch of, uh, bitmap or,

02:06:12.960 --> 02:06:18.480
you know, bitmap stuff for like all the different characters. And it was pretty cool for the record.

02:06:18.480 --> 02:06:24.000
There was a magazine that I was super into that had a short run, but it was gorgeous in its

02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:29.200
production value and their designers were freaking brilliant. Um, do you remember play?

02:06:30.160 --> 02:06:34.640
Uh, I think I still see that magazine in places. Yeah. I know that. I don't know if it's,

02:06:34.640 --> 02:06:38.800
I don't know if it's still in, well, not like new, but like collectors things, but, um,

02:06:39.520 --> 02:06:45.920
they had gorgeous spreads. I mean, the design in that magazine was so top notch. That's really,

02:06:45.920 --> 02:06:51.760
um, one of, uh, I've actually used examples from that magazine in some of my own layouts,

02:06:52.560 --> 02:06:57.520
borrowed ideas from it because it was such a group and it was very well written on top of that.

02:06:59.040 --> 02:07:01.760
Alrighty. Well, let's move on with some more news stories. Loki.

02:07:02.480 --> 02:07:08.560
All right. Um, so let's talk a little bit about, um, a follow-up kind of what we talked about last

02:07:08.560 --> 02:07:14.000
week with the whole Neo Geo X plug and play thing. Um, you remember we were talking that they were

02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:22.080
basically ending their contract with Tomo and Tomo wouldn't be able to create these, um, Neo Geo X

02:07:22.080 --> 02:07:26.640
portable systems and the dock and stuff that actually looks like the Neo Geo system and the

02:07:26.640 --> 02:07:31.360
controller and all that. Well, Tomo denies that there was any sort of breach of contract at all.

02:07:31.360 --> 02:07:37.440
And actually they're just going to continue selling the Neo Geo X anyways. And apparently there's

02:07:37.440 --> 02:07:44.240
been some comments, I guess, from people that had other agreements with SNK previously saying that,

02:07:44.240 --> 02:07:50.400
you know, they've retracted, I guess, um, or they they've tried to pull this kind of thing with

02:07:50.400 --> 02:07:55.120
other companies with licensing, but it says they're licensed. They recently extended their

02:07:55.120 --> 02:08:01.040
licensing agreement through, uh, 2016 and that they're going to basically keep, you know,

02:08:01.040 --> 02:08:07.600
publishing that stuff or making those things until their contract runs up, despite what,

02:08:07.600 --> 02:08:13.680
you know, SNK is saying, because I guess there would be a breach of contract. Um,

02:08:14.960 --> 02:08:17.520
this is kind of interesting. And so they're saying that, you know,

02:08:19.040 --> 02:08:24.480
basically they're still taking care of, I guess, all the warranties of, um, those systems as we're

02:08:24.480 --> 02:08:30.000
continuing to sell Neo Geo X products, including Neo Geo X gold system, arcade sick, mega pack,

02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:34.480
classic volumes, one through five, it says the license agreement, which allows Tomo to sell

02:08:34.480 --> 02:08:42.640
and market these products remains in effect. So that's kind of interesting. So yeah, I like that.

02:08:42.640 --> 02:08:46.720
They're not going out without a fight. This is pretty cool. Well, I mean, if they've got a

02:08:46.720 --> 02:08:50.080
contract that they signed and then all of a sudden, you know, SNK saying, well, no,

02:08:50.080 --> 02:08:54.800
we don't want to do that anymore. And unless they have like a legal out in that contract,

02:08:55.360 --> 02:09:00.880
I don't see how they can just say, no, we're not going to off, you know, we're not going to,

02:09:00.880 --> 02:09:05.760
you know, follow through that contract. Right. Right. I mean, come on. I don't know why they

02:09:05.760 --> 02:09:10.160
would do that in the first place where they don't want the Neo Geo being out there. I don't know

02:09:10.160 --> 02:09:16.480
what their plan is. All right. Guess we'll see how this plays out. Yeah. And maybe your chance

02:09:16.480 --> 02:09:21.840
isn't up to get one of these systems after all. All right. Well, uh, anyhow, uh, dark soccer,

02:09:21.840 --> 02:09:26.320
I know you like the Coleco vision. So I'm sure this news has you either very excited or very

02:09:26.320 --> 02:09:32.080
scared. Um, there's going to be an iOS app that is going to, uh, invoke the Coleco vision through,

02:09:32.080 --> 02:09:37.360
uh, you know, emulation and all that. Um, it, uh, was on Kickstarter, I guess at one point,

02:09:37.360 --> 02:09:42.400
uh, Oh no, it is, is right now actually, uh, trying to seek. I thought that this was already

02:09:42.400 --> 02:09:46.480
funded, but I guess not. They, they were doing this whole little countdown thing and I thought,

02:09:46.480 --> 02:09:50.240
Oh, they're going to unveil the app. Well, I guess they unveiled the, um, Kickstarter, but,

02:09:50.240 --> 02:09:56.080
uh, it's rant media games who did the original vet treks regeneration, which was, it's a pretty

02:09:56.080 --> 02:09:59.360
good little app. If you played it, they're trying to get a quarter million dollars through

02:09:59.360 --> 02:10:04.640
Kickstarter by November 8th to fund this iOS app. Uh, they're also targeting Android, PC,

02:10:04.640 --> 02:10:09.280
Mac, and even possibly things like the Vita. I imagine that's like stretch goals or whatever.

02:10:09.280 --> 02:10:14.160
Um, they're hoping to have a living room menu in the app and allow you to kind of swipe across the

02:10:14.160 --> 02:10:18.720
stream to get games, check out the box art, check out the cartridge. The vet treks one is pretty

02:10:18.720 --> 02:10:24.560
cool. If you haven't already played it, they do have the rights to 19 different games and sorry,

02:10:24.560 --> 02:10:28.960
Casey Munchkin is not Munchkin is not one of them. Well, Casey Munchkin wasn't on the Cliccovision.

02:10:28.960 --> 02:10:33.040
Wasn't, I thought that was the Cliccovision. That was the Magnavox Odyssey too. I don't know.

02:10:33.040 --> 02:10:38.000
Son of a bitch. Like all the different, uh, all the games that they have lists on here.

02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:43.520
I'm quite excited for actually now that I look at the list. Space Fury. I had an Atari 2600,

02:10:43.520 --> 02:10:47.280
so all those other systems kind of blurred together for me. Space Fury is one of my favorite

02:10:47.280 --> 02:10:51.520
Cliccovision games. Well, there are some pretty good ones that I even noticed here like Bump and

02:10:51.520 --> 02:10:56.240
Jump. I remember that Jumpman and Jumpman Jr. certainly remember from the 64 Montezuma's Revenge.

02:10:56.240 --> 02:11:02.320
Oh my God. That was a huge game. Uh, Zaxxon. What's the one you're looking at, Logie? Well,

02:11:02.320 --> 02:11:07.920
I used to play a ton of Bump and Jump and actually a ton of Jumpman Jr. Frenzy, Space Fury and Zaxxon.

02:11:07.920 --> 02:11:11.760
I think I've planned Pepper too. I think I've actually played most of these games except for

02:11:11.760 --> 02:11:15.120
Antarctic adventure. I don't recognize that or destructive. There are two games that I would

02:11:15.120 --> 02:11:22.000
want to be on that list and one of them would be Venture and the other one, um, would be, uh, Gorf.

02:11:23.280 --> 02:11:27.760
I would, I would put money into it if they had Gorf. And I love, I love the little, like,

02:11:27.760 --> 02:11:31.840
the boxing. They have a, you know, a bunch of different animated banners and stuff. And for

02:11:31.840 --> 02:11:37.840
platforms, they have the, uh, Rocky IV game on there, which is awesome. They have a special

02:11:37.840 --> 02:11:43.440
controller for it and everything. All right. So, um, they're looking for a quarter million

02:11:43.440 --> 02:11:48.720
dollars on Kickstarter. They've got 5,000 after the first five days, which is supposed to be,

02:11:48.720 --> 02:11:52.960
like, kind of like the biggest push. I don't know. I'm going to be just completely honest.

02:11:52.960 --> 02:11:57.520
I think a quarter million is too much money for a project like this. And I understand they justify

02:11:57.520 --> 02:12:03.280
it. And I, you know, I, it's not that I'm thinking like, oh, you know, they're not like, they're

02:12:03.280 --> 02:12:06.880
asking for too much money and we don't really know where it's going. I get it. They got to get

02:12:06.880 --> 02:12:10.800
the licensing and all this stuff. And that's where a bunch of it is, is going so that the whole

02:12:10.800 --> 02:12:15.680
thing's legal and all that. But I just think at the end of the day, you're going to ask for a

02:12:15.680 --> 02:12:21.600
quarter million dollars for an iOS app of a system that is so old. And I just, I don't think there's

02:12:21.600 --> 02:12:25.520
going to be enough people that are interested. I'm sorry. Like, I know that sounds really cruel, but

02:12:25.520 --> 02:12:30.320
especially when we were talking about a lot of retro love earlier, but that's, yeah, I don't

02:12:30.320 --> 02:12:33.760
think they're going to hit it. If they do great, more power to them. And I would love to check out

02:12:33.760 --> 02:12:39.680
the game when it comes out. Uh, but I don't know. It's a lot of money to try and get off Kickstarter.

02:12:40.960 --> 02:12:44.240
What do you guys think? Do you think I'm right? Do you think I'm being cruel? I don't think that

02:12:44.240 --> 02:12:50.720
they're going to hit it, but I wish they'd hit it if they had Gorf adventure. The, my thing though,

02:12:50.720 --> 02:12:56.480
is seriously is how these games can, I mean, cause they have a num pad on that thing. And then

02:12:56.480 --> 02:13:01.440
the joystick was really weird. So it'd be interesting to see how this is going to translate

02:13:01.440 --> 02:13:08.400
over to the actual way to plane. And that's why every time I get excited about a retro game

02:13:08.400 --> 02:13:13.520
collection on iPad, I walk away really disappointed because the touch controls just

02:13:13.520 --> 02:13:18.960
suck. Now, ever since I got the, I cayed, that's improved things significantly. The vector X game

02:13:18.960 --> 02:13:23.760
thing I think works pretty good. The I K right. And I K it's great with some of the other apps,

02:13:23.760 --> 02:13:29.280
like the, uh, uh, ARCA got midway arcade or whatever it's called that's on there. Uh,

02:13:29.280 --> 02:13:34.000
it works great, but the reality is I can't haul that thing like into bed when I'm about ready to

02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:37.280
go to, you know, I lie down there for, you know, a few minutes before I go to bed and play something

02:13:37.280 --> 02:13:40.800
on my iPad or something. Can't really do that with the I K and the touch controls just kind of

02:13:40.800 --> 02:13:45.760
blow. So every time I get excited about one of these retro remakes, I actually play it. And then

02:13:45.760 --> 02:13:51.440
I'm like, eh, I missed the real thing. So, all right. Anyhow, sorry to be Debbie downer, dark

02:13:51.440 --> 02:14:01.040
soccer. What do you got? Uh, some stuff. Well, um, the God damn stupid iPad. I will get frustrated

02:14:01.040 --> 02:14:06.000
by the touch controls too. You know what? I think this thing is touched in the head. So

02:14:07.680 --> 02:14:16.320
THQ is suing EA and Zufa. Um, and what they are suing about this time is, um, is everybody's

02:14:16.320 --> 02:14:24.000
fucking suing everybody. Um, they're suing about the, um, UFC game. Uh, basically EA was going to

02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:31.280
be releasing the, um, EA sports UFC in 2014. And, um, because they gained the license for that in

02:14:31.280 --> 02:14:40.240
June, 2012, which was six months before THQ did. And so, um, since basically THQ was bankrupt,

02:14:40.880 --> 02:14:47.280
um, Zufa paid, uh, looks like, uh, 10 million for breaking the contract. Um,

02:14:49.120 --> 02:14:56.160
and THQ says that, no, we were supposed to receive double that. So yeah, it's money. We want,

02:14:56.160 --> 02:14:59.600
we're bankrupt. We need the money. We need to pay back our attorney fees, that type of thing. So

02:14:59.600 --> 02:15:06.240
I think for what it was is I think that basically EA, uh, had insider information regarding THQ's

02:15:06.240 --> 02:15:15.040
financial standing and they let the company, they let the, uh, other company know about that and

02:15:15.040 --> 02:15:23.200
were able to negotiate a better deal because of that. And so they're off that insider information

02:15:23.200 --> 02:15:30.320
was leaked out about, you know, THQ. It is kind of funny to see, you know, THQ suing

02:15:31.840 --> 02:15:38.160
anybody because they've kind of dissolved anyways. Who is THQ anymore? It's kind of interesting.

02:15:38.160 --> 02:15:43.920
One dude at a desk. I am THQ. It's more like their lawyer. I am Spartacus.

02:15:44.640 --> 02:15:49.280
Get off my lawn and give me another $10 million. Yeah, seriously. It's whatever

02:15:49.360 --> 02:15:57.200
lawyer now represents him. Seriously. So yeah. All right, let's move on. Loki. All right. Um,

02:15:58.320 --> 02:16:02.480
so since we've been talking a little bit about crowdfunding, this is kind of interesting.

02:16:03.040 --> 02:16:10.560
Square Enix has this new partnership with Indiegogo. It's called the collective.

02:16:10.560 --> 02:16:19.680
And what it is is basically this Indiegogo curated page, um, that's going to allow people

02:16:19.680 --> 02:16:27.680
to vote over the course of 28 days. And, um, they're on different like product, uh, project

02:16:27.680 --> 02:16:36.880
pitches, including, um, rebooting an old franchise from Eidos. So, uh, I don't know. That sounds

02:16:36.880 --> 02:16:41.200
interesting, I guess, but it's kind of weird though that we have to go to crowdfunding to

02:16:41.200 --> 02:16:48.400
do that sort of thing, but whatever. Um, so basically, you know, you can pitch your ideas

02:16:48.400 --> 02:16:53.600
to developers and if people like those ideas, they may run with it. You know, whenever I see

02:16:53.600 --> 02:16:58.880
something like this, it's kind of like, yeah, we've run out of ideas. Why don't you guys give

02:16:58.880 --> 02:17:04.800
us ideas and we'll make money off of them. Um, you know, and the way they pitch it, oh, well,

02:17:04.800 --> 02:17:10.080
you can shape the development of the game and, and, you know, get these ideas out there and

02:17:10.080 --> 02:17:16.880
we'll run with them and blah, blah, blah. And I'm assuming since it's, you know, partnered with

02:17:16.880 --> 02:17:22.080
Indiegogo, does that mean we have to fund it too? You know, we're going to have to fund this game

02:17:22.080 --> 02:17:28.000
that you're going to make money off of. It's a little weird. You're a big company and you, you,

02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:32.800
you can't like, you just, you don't really have a say in it. You just, you're at the point where

02:17:32.800 --> 02:17:37.200
like, yeah, as a big company, we're just not going to take any risks anymore. We're going to

02:17:37.200 --> 02:17:42.640
let you take the risks for us. You know, um, that's kind of what it sounds like to me. Oh,

02:17:42.640 --> 02:17:46.320
but so many pitches free. If you're actually interested in this whole thing,

02:17:46.320 --> 02:17:52.160
collective.square-enix.com. So check it out. There might be some cool ideas there.

02:17:53.600 --> 02:17:58.640
As long as they're not asking us to crowdfund all the bravest too, we'll be fine. Well, I think,

02:17:58.640 --> 02:18:01.920
well, originally it was supposed to be Eidos games. I think, I don't think they mentioned

02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:06.240
Square Enix stuff. Cause you know, one's like, Oh, Hey remake file. It's just a little, it's,

02:18:06.240 --> 02:18:11.280
it's a little joke. Look, he little joke. That's all. All right. Uh, this, this has to be a joke

02:18:11.280 --> 02:18:15.360
too, but I don't think it is. It was an interview that, uh, KJ and Afune, who we've been talking a

02:18:15.360 --> 02:18:20.960
lot about on the show lately because of mighty number nine. Uh, he was, uh, talking about,

02:18:20.960 --> 02:18:26.720
uh, in an interview with, uh, I guess I'm not sure where it was. Was it, was it Japanese magazine

02:18:26.720 --> 02:18:32.000
or what? But, um, sorry, I can't properly credit this here, but, um, he was talking about, uh,

02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:38.720
the Kickstarter success and that, uh, if, uh, Capcom were to make an offer about publishing

02:18:38.720 --> 02:18:43.840
the game, he would go with Capcom and saying, quote, there is no reason not to publish with

02:18:43.840 --> 02:18:50.880
Capcom. Uh, he also talked about possibly turning this into a mega man title. If Capcom possibly

02:18:50.880 --> 02:18:55.200
wanted to go that way. Now he is more hesitant about this idea, but he didn't come out and

02:18:55.200 --> 02:19:00.960
exactly say no to it, which the gaming media is like kind of leeching onto a bit too much, I

02:19:00.960 --> 02:19:06.720
think. Uh, but whatever, uh, it says he and his crew really want this to be their thing. Um,

02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:12.000
so I kind of think we're grabbing on a little too much about the quote that, you know, if,

02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:17.520
if I want to make it a mega man game, I just, I really think that was a poor decision to even

02:19:17.520 --> 02:19:23.040
let that thought go out there because like, seriously, like I crowdfunded all this stuff

02:19:23.120 --> 02:19:26.960
just for this to come out and be another mega man game. I don't get me wrong. I like mega man,

02:19:26.960 --> 02:19:30.240
but it's like, it's, it's weird. I just don't think that they could do this at this point

02:19:30.240 --> 02:19:35.200
because how would they go about making this be a mega? I guess other than calling it mega man,

02:19:35.200 --> 02:19:39.920
I mean, because they have to fill all these backer things as mighty number nine. It's going to be a

02:19:39.920 --> 02:19:43.520
little weird if all of a sudden it's like, it's mega man. Like, you know, imagine if you had

02:19:43.520 --> 02:19:48.080
crowdfunded like a racing game and all of a sudden, Hey, yeah, we're going to go ahead and

02:19:48.080 --> 02:19:53.120
we got funding from somebody. Now it's a casino game. It's like, what? Oh, that doesn't make any

02:19:53.120 --> 02:20:00.960
sense. Um, but I don't know. I mean, essentially maybe the joke is that it's so close to mega man,

02:20:00.960 --> 02:20:05.360
you might as well just call it mega man, you know, and if Capcom paid them some money,

02:20:05.360 --> 02:20:08.560
they'll just call it mega man. It'll be a mega game. Cause it's essentially mega man.

02:20:10.960 --> 02:20:15.600
I think they're drawing straws. All right. Um, I'm going to pause recording here real

02:20:15.600 --> 02:20:21.760
quick because unfortunately our stream is down at server room. Uh, so thank you, sir. I know.

02:20:21.760 --> 02:20:25.840
Right. So, uh, we'll be right back here after a quick look for the podcast listeners. We'll be

02:20:25.840 --> 02:20:29.760
right back after a quick little, uh, music note here. And, uh, we'll talk a little more

02:20:29.760 --> 02:20:35.040
about this and some other news to register participation for this week's episode of orange

02:20:35.040 --> 02:20:39.760
lounge radio at vog network.com. Use the passphrase expert. All right. And we're back

02:20:39.760 --> 02:20:43.760
here at orange lounge radio. Unfortunately, some technical difficulties that were a little bit out

02:20:43.760 --> 02:20:48.080
of our control. Uh, we'll, we'll be following up with our hosting provider this week and

02:20:48.080 --> 02:20:52.480
figuring out why on two Sundays in a row, they have decided to reset the server or whatever

02:20:52.480 --> 02:20:57.120
they're doing that is causing the show to drop out. And, uh, if they can't give us a good answer,

02:20:57.120 --> 02:21:01.920
we will look into a different provider for a future broadcast. In the meantime,

02:21:02.560 --> 02:21:05.920
let's get back where we left off. We've been talking about mighty number nine and the whole

02:21:05.920 --> 02:21:11.600
mega man thing. And the, um, you know, the, the, the fact that it was kick-started and the only

02:21:11.600 --> 02:21:16.080
other thing I want to get out with this is that, you know, I, I get why he says if Capcom makes

02:21:16.080 --> 02:21:20.080
the best publishing deal, then that's the company they're going to go with. Like, that's just

02:21:20.080 --> 02:21:25.040
business, right? I don't think they're going to be, but he would, I think, I think that was kind

02:21:25.040 --> 02:21:29.840
of like interview bait. I think somebody baited him to say that for a headline, like, Oh,

02:21:29.840 --> 02:21:35.280
mighty number nine is going to go through Capcom and it's going to be ironic. It probably won't.

02:21:35.280 --> 02:21:40.080
It could, but I mean, the way Capcom has been going lately and the fact that they, you know,

02:21:40.080 --> 02:21:43.200
kind of denied this guy, the mega man game he wants to make, do you think they're really

02:21:43.200 --> 02:21:47.840
going to come back and make the best deal to publish it? Probably not. I think somebody else

02:21:47.840 --> 02:21:57.200
will. And that'll be that. So, all right. Uh, anyhow, uh, let's move on to our mailbag every

02:21:57.200 --> 02:22:02.880
week. You guys send us emails, mailbag at orange launch, radio.com. And we go through the mailbag

02:22:02.880 --> 02:22:09.600
and try to read some of our favorite emails here. Live dark Sakura dive into that mailbag,

02:22:09.600 --> 02:22:13.440
mailbag at orange launch, radio.com. And, uh, tell us what emails we have tonight.

02:22:13.440 --> 02:22:18.880
We have a few. Um, I will start with the first one from the Nasty Canasta.

02:22:20.400 --> 02:22:24.400
Hi, OLR. I'd like to give my impressions on a game that's soon to be re-released, um,

02:22:24.400 --> 02:22:29.600
Deus Ex Human Revolution. I was sitting in my big ass PC backlog for nearly, no,

02:22:29.600 --> 02:22:33.760
this was sitting in my big ass PC backlog for nearly two years when I finally got around to

02:22:33.760 --> 02:22:39.280
playing it. I snuck a solid hundred hours into it within the span of a month. Um, this is going

02:22:39.280 --> 02:22:44.160
into the story. I'm gonna skip forward because I don't want to spoil it for anyone who might play

02:22:44.160 --> 02:22:49.440
it. So, a game with an engaging plot needs some kickass gameplay to back it up and Deus Ex delivers

02:22:49.440 --> 02:22:54.960
for the most part. This, um, in this first person RPG you can be gung-ho by making use of the guns

02:22:54.960 --> 02:22:59.600
to blast the shit out of people. Take a more merciful route by knocking out enemies, sneaking

02:22:59.600 --> 02:23:05.040
and hacking your way through areas or a combination of all three. It is up to you to play however you

02:23:05.040 --> 02:23:08.960
want, though you'll be making progressively harder choices as you get closer to the end.

02:23:08.960 --> 02:23:12.560
For the record, I watched, um, Becky's husband play through a little bit of this. It was really

02:23:12.560 --> 02:23:19.040
good. Now, I say the game delivers for the most part because there are some significant flaws.

02:23:19.040 --> 02:23:23.040
First, the game's occasionally buggy with handling ragdolls, especially when they clip and get stuck

02:23:23.040 --> 02:23:28.400
in floors. Icky. Second, while the game rewards XP for various actions you do, you are awarded the

02:23:28.400 --> 02:23:33.680
most points for playing pacifist with stealth. Although you can play however you want, the XP

02:23:33.760 --> 02:23:39.040
rewards are pretty much big neon signs saying, want this augmentation? Do melee takedowns, bro!

02:23:39.840 --> 02:23:43.840
Even though one of the game's achievements requires to not kill anyone in your entire

02:23:43.840 --> 02:23:49.040
playthrough. Finally, the boss fights stand out like a sore thumb. They force the player into

02:23:49.040 --> 02:23:54.480
lethal combat, which puts pacifist players at a major disadvantage given their play style and the

02:23:54.480 --> 02:23:59.440
items they'll be carrying in their inventory. Despite these problems, I highly encourage

02:23:59.440 --> 02:24:03.600
everyone to try it out, especially if you have a PC or got the game through PlayStation Plus.

02:24:04.400 --> 02:24:08.960
The re-release fixes boss fights for pacifist players. I need to get back to the screen.

02:24:13.680 --> 02:24:18.960
Has touchscreen players for all platforms, Wii U, GamePad, Smart Glass, PS3, Vita, CrossControl,

02:24:18.960 --> 02:24:24.960
and TBA for PC, and bundles of DLC content. And before I forget, the game looks absolutely

02:24:24.960 --> 02:24:28.480
gorgeous and the soundtrack is fantastic. And that comes from the Nasty Canasta.

02:24:29.840 --> 02:24:34.400
I've heard many, many good things about that game. Speaking of which, it will be coming out again.

02:24:34.400 --> 02:24:40.160
They're doing a director's cut that's coming out in the 22nd North America and for the first time

02:24:40.160 --> 02:24:45.920
on the Wii U as well. So that'll be on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 for about 30 bucks. And Wii U,

02:24:46.720 --> 02:24:50.080
which this is a great selling point, the Wii U version is actually $20 more.

02:24:50.640 --> 02:25:00.320
So next email. Yes.

02:25:01.040 --> 02:25:06.240
Hey guys, Monty Boggs here. Just thought I would email in and share my thoughts on the 2DS.

02:25:06.240 --> 02:25:11.120
I bought one last afternoon along with Pokemon Y naturally, and I am completely surprised by

02:25:11.120 --> 02:25:15.120
how much I enjoyed this handheld system. I was negative on the system at the original

02:25:15.120 --> 02:25:19.280
announcement, but with the low price, I thought I would give it a shot. It fits pretty good in

02:25:19.280 --> 02:25:23.680
my bigger, it should be pretty well in my bigger hands. It's a minimalist design.

02:25:24.560 --> 02:25:28.320
It's minimalist design features and price are all I'm looking for in a system to play on the

02:25:28.320 --> 02:25:34.960
couch at home or throw my laptop back on the go. I think anyone wanting to get access to the 3DS

02:25:34.960 --> 02:25:39.920
library and doesn't care about 3D should at least consider a 2DS as I personally think it is the

02:25:39.920 --> 02:25:46.640
best feeling portable in some time. Also the $70 cheaper price more than makes up for the smaller

02:25:46.640 --> 02:25:52.640
screen than the XL. On a side note, I'm already six hours into Pokemon and I'm not the type of

02:25:52.640 --> 02:25:56.960
gamer that typically plays that much at a time. I haven't played a Pokemon game since the GBA,

02:25:56.960 --> 02:26:02.080
so I'm not exactly the typical Pokemon fanatic either. So while lots of people are talking

02:26:02.080 --> 02:26:08.640
next gen, I'm going to be perfectly happy with my new Wii U and 2DS combo for the foreseeable future.

02:26:08.640 --> 02:26:12.480
I can't wait for Super Mario 3D World and the new Legend of Zelda for 3DS.

02:26:12.480 --> 02:26:14.320
Love the show. Take care. Monty Boggs.

02:26:16.560 --> 02:26:19.840
I'm glad that you're enjoying it. It sounds like he is quite enjoy.

02:26:20.640 --> 02:26:21.840
Quite enjoy. Quite enjoy.

02:26:22.560 --> 02:26:25.680
All right, we have two emails left. One of them is long. Kinda long.

02:26:27.280 --> 02:26:32.000
Hello, OLR gang. This is my first time giving my voice to the show,

02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:36.720
being on the East Coast and having to be up Monday at 5 30 AM. I'm not able to listen to

02:26:36.720 --> 02:26:41.440
your show live. I do, however, listen to every episode while I'm at work every Monday morning.

02:26:41.440 --> 02:26:42.800
Well, I'm glad you do. Thank you.

02:26:44.160 --> 02:26:49.120
I am a 34 year old gamer who started gaming fairly late compared to you guys. My first

02:26:49.120 --> 02:26:54.080
console was the original NES. And let me go back to the stupid chat room before it logs out.

02:26:54.720 --> 02:26:59.440
Okay. My parents were not a fan of me spending time on gaming and not interacting with people,

02:26:59.440 --> 02:27:03.760
so I never got another console until I was older and able to purchase my own.

02:27:03.760 --> 02:27:10.240
So to make a life story short, I've only played NES, PS2, original Wii and Xbox 360.

02:27:10.240 --> 02:27:14.880
I do, however, find that I'm mostly a PC gamer. I started in PC gaming, I guess you could say,

02:27:15.920 --> 02:27:24.800
on my appearance of 486 DX 66 and Commander Keen, although I didn't really get into gaming until my

02:27:24.800 --> 02:27:30.400
first MMO, Dark Ages of Camelot. I was so addicted to that game, I would play until 2 or 3 AM and

02:27:30.400 --> 02:27:34.880
then wake up at 6 30 the next morning for school. Those were the days when I would do that and not

02:27:34.880 --> 02:27:41.920
feel like crap the next morning. Since DAOC, I have jumped around from MMO to MMO. I've played

02:27:41.920 --> 02:27:45.680
WoW, Star Wars Galaxy, Star Wars The Old Republic, Champions Online, Guild Wars 2, Neverwinter,

02:27:45.680 --> 02:27:50.320
just to name a few. I'm sure there are more that I'm forgetting about. Currently I decided to see

02:27:50.320 --> 02:27:54.640
what all the hype about Mass Effect was all about, so I purchased the trilogy during the summer

02:27:54.640 --> 02:27:58.640
months when it was on sale. I've played through all of Mass Effect 1 and 2 and I'm currently

02:27:58.640 --> 02:28:02.640
working on 3. I do have to say I've enjoyed the storyline, but there are some things that annoy

02:28:02.640 --> 02:28:06.960
me about the games like in Mass Effect 2 and Mass Effect 3, not being able to open the journal

02:28:06.960 --> 02:28:11.520
without hitting escape and then clicking the journal menu item. Why couldn't they make a key

02:28:11.520 --> 02:28:14.880
bind for the stuff like that? By the way, I think that some of the menu differences in that were

02:28:14.880 --> 02:28:19.760
just with the differences of the Unreal Engine. I do believe, because you'll notice also their

02:28:19.760 --> 02:28:22.400
texture rendering was different. A lot of the menu systems are different.

02:28:24.800 --> 02:28:31.600
Also, I think if you are playing on PC, you can create a bind to load your journal, but you have

02:28:31.600 --> 02:28:41.360
to mod your coalesced INI to put that in there. If you go to my tumblr, masseffecting.tumblr.com,

02:28:41.360 --> 02:28:46.880
I will see if I can find the answer to that and show you how to make the key bind. I even share

02:28:46.880 --> 02:28:53.040
my own coalesced INI with you. Just saying, because I am totally into modding my games.

02:28:55.120 --> 02:28:59.120
Anyways, enough about Mass Effect, enough about me. I thought I was about to say Mass Effect,

02:28:59.120 --> 02:29:03.600
but it's actually me. My question for you guys to ponder, with Valve's latest announcements about

02:29:03.600 --> 02:29:08.880
the Steam Machine and SteamOS, do you think this could have game makers to start considering PC

02:29:08.880 --> 02:29:15.440
gaming as a viable competitor in the console war? With a 5 year old daughter, I have had to focus

02:29:15.440 --> 02:29:20.400
my gaming on PC. With a second child on the way in June, I've had to put my plans to purchase the

02:29:20.400 --> 02:29:28.400
next gen in the new year on the back burner. By the way, congratulations. Indeed. I do, however,

02:29:28.400 --> 02:29:35.360
have a fairly powerful i5 dual core with 60GB of RAM PC that I thought could handle most of the

02:29:35.360 --> 02:29:39.760
games that will be coming out. I'm hoping my thoughts on the Steam Machines and SteamOS

02:29:39.760 --> 02:29:44.560
bringing PC gaming into direct competition with consoles is true, so more games will come out for

02:29:44.560 --> 02:29:50.960
PC, and the ones that do come out will come out around the same times as console, unlike GTA 5.

02:29:54.480 --> 02:30:01.120
I think it's still too early to call that. I think that right now PC is going to continue to be

02:30:01.120 --> 02:30:08.240
treated the same way, but if whatever the Steam Box ends up being does give more accessibility

02:30:08.960 --> 02:30:13.440
to those PC games, then they might think about it. But right now, I can tell you just about

02:30:13.440 --> 02:30:17.760
anything, when you have a business market, people are slow to try something new. Unless they are

02:30:17.760 --> 02:30:24.800
desperate. Just saying. Sorry, can you summarize for me, because I was firing off an angry email

02:30:24.800 --> 02:30:31.280
to our service provider about what's going on. If you think the oncoming Steam Box and SteamOS

02:30:31.280 --> 02:30:39.120
will cause PC gaming to be more of a competitor to the console market. Nah. I don't think so.

02:30:39.280 --> 02:30:45.360
I think it's so early to say, because the price is a huge motivator in that regard.

02:30:48.400 --> 02:30:54.240
I don't know. The Steam Machine is trying to take things closer to a dedicated game processor

02:30:54.240 --> 02:31:00.320
and device, but it's not really one. It's more dedicated than maybe a Windows machine is, but

02:31:00.320 --> 02:31:07.120
it's not solely dedicated like a Playstation or an Xbox is. So I'm not sure that certain things that

02:31:07.120 --> 02:31:10.960
you do on a gaming console will necessarily be possible on one of these devices. I don't know.

02:31:10.960 --> 02:31:15.920
I sort of just think there's still room for the consoles. I think there's some potential there,

02:31:15.920 --> 02:31:20.000
but what my point was is that a lot of times when you're dealing with the consumer market,

02:31:20.560 --> 02:31:26.880
people are slow to switch up what works. They don't want to make the big risk unless they're

02:31:26.880 --> 02:31:33.120
completely desperate. Anyway, thanks for the great shows. I love listening to the many shows on VOG,

02:31:33.120 --> 02:31:38.880
including Bobby Show, OLR, and Hoard House. The shows help to make my work week a lot more

02:31:38.880 --> 02:31:43.760
interesting. And have a great one, Cyber Judge. Thank you for emailing us. Thank you. It's always,

02:31:43.760 --> 02:31:46.880
um, I like hearing from the veterans and the people that talk to us frequently,

02:31:46.880 --> 02:31:50.640
but I like hearing from new people too. I really like hearing from new people.

02:31:51.920 --> 02:31:58.960
Although I love all of you guys. Hey guys! Hey! So I've been trying to get into gaming,

02:31:58.960 --> 02:32:04.640
but even though I have a dual box Mac Pro, Macbook Pro, I still wonder what game I should

02:32:04.640 --> 02:32:10.400
play since I am, like, broke as a joke. I mean, I know Final Fantasy XIV is out, but I cannot afford

02:32:10.400 --> 02:32:15.440
it. I enjoyed it during the open beta, but a connection etc issue kept me from really enjoying

02:32:15.440 --> 02:32:19.840
it. I wish I could afford it while I'm looking for a job, but it's going to be a little hard for me

02:32:19.840 --> 02:32:26.720
too. What do you guys think that it's, do you guys think that it's one of those games that will last

02:32:26.720 --> 02:32:31.360
for a while, like Eleven did? Is there any Mac or PC games you think I should try in your opinion?

02:32:31.360 --> 02:32:36.000
That's free. Thank you for answering me. If so, you're a listener of many years uni.

02:32:37.680 --> 02:32:42.400
Um, well, if your computer is solid enough to run Final Fantasy XIV at all during the beta,

02:32:42.400 --> 02:32:46.160
then there's a lot of free to play stuff out there that you can check out. And some of those are,

02:32:46.160 --> 02:32:50.080
you know, MMO type things. I mean, you've got Star Wars, the older, well, I don't know how many of

02:32:50.080 --> 02:32:55.440
these are on Mac. That's the problem. Ragnarok Online, I think, might, or Ragnarok 2 anyway.

02:32:56.080 --> 02:33:04.240
But I used to play the old school Ragnarok Online through free servers on a Mac using an emulator.

02:33:05.440 --> 02:33:09.120
I have to admit, I don't know which of these are playable on Mac, but I will tell you Star Wars,

02:33:09.120 --> 02:33:16.160
The Old Republic, Rift, both free, both very solid MMOs to check out. I would highly recommend

02:33:16.160 --> 02:33:20.320
getting Steam and checking out the free to play game section on there because there's an awful

02:33:20.320 --> 02:33:26.160
lot in there. Uh, more MMOs, even things like Star Trek Online, uh, Marvel Heroes is a pretty

02:33:26.160 --> 02:33:30.160
fun to play one. If you like Diablo at all, and you like your comic book people, that's free to

02:33:30.160 --> 02:33:34.720
play as well. Um, even things that are like up a totally different alley, like Spiral Knights,

02:33:34.720 --> 02:33:39.920
Sega is there, you know, there's, there's more and more free to play stuff on Steam that's worth

02:33:39.920 --> 02:33:44.880
checking out and Steam's gonna make it very clear what's on Mac and what's not. And you can also,

02:33:44.880 --> 02:33:48.640
if it's still going on the Not On Steam sale, because I do believe there were some Mac titles

02:33:48.640 --> 02:33:54.000
included in that. Right. They weren't free, but they're low, low, low cost. Yeah. Pretty cheap.

02:33:54.000 --> 02:33:58.720
Yeah. Don't be afraid to play stuff that's maybe under the radar because there's some great indie

02:33:58.720 --> 02:34:02.480
games and things that, you know, not, maybe not everybody's necessarily into right at this moment

02:34:02.480 --> 02:34:07.840
that are still worth checking out. I also do suggest installing, what is it called for, um,

02:34:08.640 --> 02:34:14.240
not Flash, but it's a game engine that runs through, um, browsers that, uh, the Disney games,

02:34:14.240 --> 02:34:18.800
like the Wreck-It Ralph games used. Yuni's actually in our chat right now saying that

02:34:18.800 --> 02:34:22.960
she has dual boxed Windows 7 and Mac Mountain Lion. Oh, well then you're good for a lot of

02:34:22.960 --> 02:34:26.960
these games you're talking. If you want MMOs, I would say check out the Old Republic if you

02:34:26.960 --> 02:34:31.600
even remotely like BioWare games or Star Wars. And I don't think you necessarily even have to

02:34:31.600 --> 02:34:35.120
like Star Wars to enjoy the Old Republic. I still think it's pretty good game on its own.

02:34:35.120 --> 02:34:40.240
And Rift for sure. If you liked Warcraft and that you'd probably like Rift. And someone might gift

02:34:40.240 --> 02:34:47.120
you Mass Effect when it goes for sale again. Someone. Somebody super nice. Yeah. There's

02:34:47.120 --> 02:34:50.320
some really nice persons sitting at this table right now. Uh, Dungeon Buster in our chat room

02:34:50.320 --> 02:34:54.800
at live.fognetwork.com says Neverwinter is a pretty decent free to play Dungeons & Dragons MMO.

02:34:54.800 --> 02:34:58.480
Yes, I've heard of that one too. It's Unity. That's, that's what I thought it was, but I

02:34:58.480 --> 02:35:04.480
didn't quite want to call it. I'd be wrong. So is that it for emails? Yup. There you go.

02:35:04.480 --> 02:35:08.240
Mailbag at orangelauntrader.com if you have a question for a future week.

02:35:08.960 --> 02:35:13.360
All right. Uh, let's do the FUs of the week folks. Cause we're mad.

02:35:30.720 --> 02:35:35.040
FU to my stepdad. And to put this in the most general of terms.

02:35:35.040 --> 02:35:42.000
Just because somebody else doesn't believe something that you, that you do, or doesn't

02:35:42.000 --> 02:35:46.960
agree with you does not mean that they're closed minded. For all you know, they could have done

02:35:46.960 --> 02:35:53.680
their research and found that it's not for them. Using inflammatory statements to try to guilt

02:35:53.680 --> 02:35:59.120
trip somebody into changing their opinion or into evoking an emotional response that makes

02:35:59.120 --> 02:36:04.320
you look like you're staying calm is no way to have a discussion. It's immature and it is beneath

02:36:04.320 --> 02:36:09.920
you and I am done. What you showed me was pretty tacky. That's really the best word I can think

02:36:09.920 --> 02:36:17.760
of for it. Tacky. Loki. Uh, FU to

02:36:20.240 --> 02:36:25.680
Grand Theft Auto 5. Cause that's all I'm playing. I don't know. It's become your life. FU to the

02:36:25.680 --> 02:36:32.080
fact that I don't have a voice today. FU to stress, making me sick when I eat and FU to

02:36:32.080 --> 02:36:36.400
the fact that our show cut out while we're trying to do it. I hate that. Especially when

02:36:36.400 --> 02:36:42.400
it's out of our control. Rawr. Definitely a suitable FU of the week. All right. A couple

02:36:42.400 --> 02:36:45.680
more stories for you guys. Then we'll open up the Skypline for a little bit and try to do some

02:36:45.680 --> 02:36:49.280
Twitter topics as well too. I'm going to, I'm going to warn you guys with this. If you want

02:36:49.280 --> 02:36:53.280
to get in on the Skypline tonight, you need to call like as soon as we open it up. Cause I can't,

02:36:53.280 --> 02:36:56.240
we're not going to be able to sit around tonight and wait for seven minutes going,

02:36:56.240 --> 02:37:00.480
is somebody going to call? Somebody going to call? So either you want to participate or you

02:37:00.480 --> 02:37:05.280
don't tonight. Rawr. You have a 10 second window. All right. You better be on it. But after two

02:37:05.280 --> 02:37:11.840
stories. So Loki, you first. So despite some sort of a delay in the whole purchasing process,

02:37:11.840 --> 02:37:18.240
thanks to the Delaware Supreme Court, um, the ruling has, um, made, made in favor of

02:37:18.240 --> 02:37:24.640
Activision and yes, they will be allowed to buy the, um, I guess $8.2 billion of their own shares

02:37:24.640 --> 02:37:34.000
from Vivendi. Um, and just a few days here on October 15th. So they will once they will become

02:37:34.000 --> 02:37:39.200
their own company again, I guess, or more of their own company. So I remember hearing about this

02:37:39.200 --> 02:37:44.720
before a little bit. So the news here is that it's been approved basically. So, because there was

02:37:44.720 --> 02:37:49.280
concern, was it wasn't, it was a shareholder. It was one of the shareholders that was

02:37:49.280 --> 02:37:55.120
seeing that they were doing this to somehow, I don't know, somehow screw them out of money

02:37:55.120 --> 02:38:00.880
or something. I don't know how it was. Um, but yeah, it basically got over overturned, so

02:38:02.080 --> 02:38:07.520
they can do it. All right. Uh, well, you know what? All the changes I've seen in World of

02:38:07.520 --> 02:38:12.160
Warcraft ever since this split have been for the better. So, and Diablo three, hello,

02:38:12.160 --> 02:38:15.600
auction house going away. That's great news. That's going to bring a whole group of new people into

02:38:15.600 --> 02:38:21.760
the game. So we'll see. Meanwhile, Hey, we, you owners, I know you have been waiting for

02:38:21.760 --> 02:38:27.040
that killer game that will finally just make this thing fucking fly off of shelves. And, uh, you

02:38:27.040 --> 02:38:31.600
know, it might be, it might be, you know, Mario 3d world two or whatever it could be. It could be

02:38:31.600 --> 02:38:36.560
a Mario Kart eight or what have you, but you know what I think it's going to be. I think that killer

02:38:36.560 --> 02:38:43.680
must have app for the Wii U is going to be Hello Kitty cruisers, which is coming to the Wii U this

02:38:43.680 --> 02:38:48.800
year beating Mario Kart eight to the party. And, uh, that's Hello Kitty cruisers by the way,

02:38:48.800 --> 02:38:54.400
with a K and all I know is from this screenshot, you can play as bad bats Maru. I mean,

02:38:54.400 --> 02:38:59.760
do you, do you fucking need anything else in a Hello Kitty game? Well, you can totally get a

02:38:59.760 --> 02:39:05.040
jacked version of rainbow road from the Mario Kart games with little Hello Kitty space planets.

02:39:05.040 --> 02:39:08.720
I don't know what else to call these things from the back room. I wonder if you can play

02:39:08.720 --> 02:39:13.920
as little twin stars. Who knows anything's possible. Um, so there are some screenshots

02:39:13.920 --> 02:39:17.760
available and, uh, yeah, you can check that out, uh, coming later this year. I don't know how much

02:39:17.760 --> 02:39:23.200
and I don't know exactly what day, but, uh, it's Hello Kitty. Oh, it's November 5th. And how much?

02:39:23.200 --> 02:39:28.400
I think it's $40. If I remember correctly, the countdown is on and it's a slight budget title.

02:39:28.960 --> 02:39:35.120
It's not a $60 game. It's $40. It's, uh, yeah, it's this company in Burgos or Burgosala lightweight

02:39:35.200 --> 02:39:40.880
or something like that. And they, uh, mainly just do Hello Kitty games. They just released

02:39:40.880 --> 02:39:48.320
one actually on the 3DS last week or week before last. I am excited as hell. What can I say?

02:39:48.960 --> 02:39:55.040
So yeah, it's, um, I don't know. And I did mention it back in June, by the way,

02:39:55.040 --> 02:40:01.280
remember on, on Twitter, I'd mentioned there was a game of show and I forgot. I forgot. You know

02:40:01.280 --> 02:40:06.000
what, if I'm not seeing news on it every five seconds, it tends to, uh, go away from my memory,

02:40:06.000 --> 02:40:10.560
you know, as, as, as a lot of people and as a lot of folks in gaming culture, we tend to forget

02:40:10.560 --> 02:40:15.440
these things, right? Yes. Remember, remember when, uh, Sony went down for an entire day and,

02:40:15.440 --> 02:40:18.560
and everybody said, I'll never buy another Sony product again. And then they unveiled

02:40:18.560 --> 02:40:24.160
the PlayStation four and everybody was like, Oh, nevermind. I'm just kidding. Yeah. Yeah.

02:40:24.160 --> 02:40:27.440
Sony went down for a long time. Remember that. Remember when they had a problem with their clocks

02:40:27.440 --> 02:40:33.280
and it comes? All right. Anyhow, uh, let's do it. Let's get to some phone calls. One eight seven

02:40:33.280 --> 02:40:37.600
seven game OLR or a username on Skype is orange lounge radio, but we already have a call coming

02:40:37.600 --> 02:40:41.920
in. So let's get to it. Hi, you're on orange launch radio. Who's this? Yo guys, it's Zina

02:40:41.920 --> 02:40:46.080
core from OKC. How you doing? Hey Zina core. Good to hear from you as always. How are you? We're

02:40:46.080 --> 02:40:51.200
good. It's good to know. I know about the right time for the delay in the radio to pick up. So

02:40:51.200 --> 02:40:55.680
you've got this down to a science. You beat Rama tonight. That's something. Oh, cool. I'll put,

02:40:55.680 --> 02:40:59.280
I'll put that on my list. All right. Give yourself a gold star. All right. What's up?

02:40:59.280 --> 02:41:05.440
What's in your mind, buddy? Uh, the, uh, the web game for the fan made attack on Titan game. That

02:41:05.440 --> 02:41:11.200
thing is actually pretty damn polished. I was surprised. Hmm. What is it? Have you guys not

02:41:11.200 --> 02:41:14.960
seen it yet? No, I haven't. Tell us a little more about this. I haven't been into the anime at all.

02:41:14.960 --> 02:41:21.120
So I've been pretty much ignoring it on Tumblr. Now that some guy used the unity engine to make

02:41:21.200 --> 02:41:28.800
a fan, uh, inspired version of defending humanity against the Titans and it's pretty damn good. It

02:41:28.800 --> 02:41:33.920
plays really well. It almost feels like Spiderman as far as the swinging mechanic is down. It's

02:41:33.920 --> 02:41:37.760
really intuitive after a couple of matches and it's just as deadly as the real game is. So

02:41:38.560 --> 02:41:44.080
yeah, I highly encourage everybody to play it. There you go. How much is that? Is that a free

02:41:44.080 --> 02:41:48.320
one? Oh yeah, it's free. It's got just making it and threw it up on the interwebs just because

02:41:48.320 --> 02:41:52.640
he loves the, uh, loves the game. I just threw the link up there in chat if anybody wants to

02:41:52.640 --> 02:41:57.440
check it out. Nice. It's fangly.com slash game slash AOG. So, well, there's something for the

02:41:57.440 --> 02:42:00.560
email or a little bit ago who is looking for some free games to play. There you go.

02:42:01.120 --> 02:42:05.680
Yeah, there you go. What else have you been playing lately? Uh, that and some war thunder

02:42:05.680 --> 02:42:13.280
online just to get my, uh, air to air combat jeans taken care of. Yeah, that's done, that's

02:42:13.280 --> 02:42:16.560
done pretty well. They're getting ready to release the tanks too. Apparently they're trying to do

02:42:16.560 --> 02:42:23.200
both land, sea and air battles all in one, a massive arena game, uh, all of world war two.

02:42:23.200 --> 02:42:28.320
So it's quite extensive. It's really good. Uh, you fan pretty regularly these, uh, air fighting

02:42:28.320 --> 02:42:32.480
games, like Ace Combat stuff? Every once in a while. I mean, they just now started popping up

02:42:32.480 --> 02:42:36.560
in the, I guess since League of Legends took over, everybody's doing their own version of

02:42:36.560 --> 02:42:41.920
massive online battle arena. Oh, I didn't even realize they kind of did that in, uh,

02:42:41.920 --> 02:42:48.320
like airplane form. Yeah. I mean, you just spawn in everybody, depending on what army you're with,

02:42:48.320 --> 02:42:51.760
you pick a side, you fight it out and sooner or later somebody wins the battle and that's it.

02:42:51.760 --> 02:42:55.280
That's kind of cool. Gosh, I don't remember the last time I like seriously played like a

02:42:55.280 --> 02:43:00.720
airplane combat game like that. It was probably top gun on the NES. And, uh, you go into that

02:43:00.720 --> 02:43:07.200
intense rage when you can't refuel your damn plane. Oh yeah, most definitely. And, uh, since

02:43:07.200 --> 02:43:10.960
this one's free on steam, it's bound to be picking up tons of people, especially with this next

02:43:10.960 --> 02:43:15.360
experience when they add tanks, they just teased it over in, uh, in one of the Russian cons. So

02:43:15.360 --> 02:43:21.120
it looked quite good. I'm all about free steam is really developing a nice little free library on

02:43:21.120 --> 02:43:25.440
there. It's pretty cool. So that's going to be the neat thing when they get that steam machine

02:43:25.440 --> 02:43:28.880
out there, it's going to be huge marketing thing for them is that, Hey, all you have to do is buy

02:43:28.880 --> 02:43:34.160
the system and you can get all these games for free because they're all free. So it's a great

02:43:34.160 --> 02:43:39.040
way to market stuff. So, yeah. So that's what I've been up to, man. Y'all take it easy. Excellent

02:43:39.360 --> 02:43:44.800
All right. It's awesome to hear from you as always take care. All right. Bye. I like hearing

02:43:44.800 --> 02:43:48.880
fans of games, especially when they're free, come on the show and then plug them like, Hey,

02:43:48.880 --> 02:43:52.240
is this off your radar? Cause maybe it should like be on your radar if it's something you're

02:43:52.240 --> 02:43:56.480
interested in. So appreciate that. Let's open up the phone one more time. You can call us at

02:43:56.480 --> 02:44:02.640
1 8 7 7 game O L R or you can contact us on Skype, orange lounge radio, all one word. Uh,

02:44:02.640 --> 02:44:06.320
while we wait for another call to come in, I've got a couple tweets to read about. Oh no,

02:44:06.320 --> 02:44:10.720
they're there. Phone lines already lighten up near mine, but I will get to tweets and last

02:44:10.720 --> 02:44:15.200
minute stories here in a minute. First, let me go to the phones. Hi on orange on radio. Who's this?

02:44:15.200 --> 02:44:20.720
Hey, it's Ron. Hey buddy. You got beat tonight. Well, that's because I'm still dealing with stuff

02:44:20.720 --> 02:44:26.560
from New York comic con. So excuses, excuses. All right. Well, tell us about the con already. How

02:44:26.560 --> 02:44:33.520
was it? It was pretty good. I have to admit for a Saturday, it wasn't as crowded as I thought it

02:44:33.520 --> 02:44:40.160
was really. Yeah. Is that because everybody was so pissed off that their Twitters were tweeting

02:44:40.160 --> 02:44:45.200
things that they weren't intending on saying about the show. I just, I heard about this. No,

02:44:45.200 --> 02:44:51.840
I want you to know that when you register your badge, you can opt out of that. And we all know

02:44:51.840 --> 02:44:57.600
not everybody reads the fine print. You fill out the form, you spin down to the end that you

02:44:57.600 --> 02:45:02.240
accept and you acknowledge, add this, add that done. Did you guys hear about this? What happened?

02:45:02.320 --> 02:45:06.240
Like, yeah, the people that were registering and, and for whatever, for New York comic con,

02:45:06.240 --> 02:45:09.840
I don't know why, but they were tying their Twitter accounts or something to the registration.

02:45:09.840 --> 02:45:14.480
And like when they, when the smartphones picked up that these guys were at the convention,

02:45:14.480 --> 02:45:18.800
it would automatically tweet, I'm having a great time in New York comic con. And people were like,

02:45:18.800 --> 02:45:23.600
pissed that this thing was tweeting for stupid. They shut it down and like,

02:45:23.600 --> 02:45:30.160
they shut it down in like 12 hours. That's that intrusive advertising we were talking about

02:45:30.160 --> 02:45:37.440
earlier. Not smart. So anyway, sorry. Now that we got the little dark cloud around comic con out

02:45:37.440 --> 02:45:40.800
of the way, tell us more about the good stuff. Not to mention the other dark cloud around comic con.

02:45:41.440 --> 02:45:44.320
Oh, I didn't hear about other stuff. Was there more shenanigans I didn't hear about?

02:45:47.280 --> 02:45:52.400
Listen, listen to my podcast. We're going to talk about that in depth because I have a personal

02:45:52.400 --> 02:45:57.680
interest in that. Oh my. All right. I guess I've missed the news. Being busy with my show

02:45:57.680 --> 02:46:00.640
yesterday probably made me miss that. If you read my Tumblr, you would have seen it.

02:46:00.640 --> 02:46:06.880
Well, I have not read your Tumblr, Jamie, because I've been busy. But anyway, sorry if your Tumblr

02:46:06.880 --> 02:46:13.200
isn't the first place I go on the internet for all the news, DarkSakura. All right. But for real,

02:46:13.200 --> 02:46:16.080
tell us, tell us some good news out of New York comic con for heaven's sake.

02:46:18.320 --> 02:46:24.000
Um, the re-release of Ron Mo and F on Blu-ray. Oh, that sounds nice. Yes.

02:46:24.160 --> 02:46:31.120
Um, I was asked to be a part of, um, a retrospective that Viz is putting out and

02:46:31.120 --> 02:46:36.960
we got to see some screenshots between a DVD and a Blu-ray. It looks beautiful. And,

02:46:37.920 --> 02:46:48.240
and for Ookchan's sake, they're re-subbing the episodes. Ooh, happy. Yes. Yes. I hope they're

02:46:48.240 --> 02:46:53.520
more accurate. Yes. You're going to shed a tear when you watch this. Yay. I need this then. This

02:46:53.600 --> 02:46:57.760
has to be a part of my life. So were they actually showing this at comic con, the new Blu-ray?

02:46:58.560 --> 02:47:03.680
They, yeah, they actually showed it on, I think Thursday or Friday, because I only had a one day

02:47:03.680 --> 02:47:08.480
badge and I was talking about how much they saw it and I'm like, I hate you guys. Nice. And you

02:47:08.480 --> 02:47:13.600
know, your name is DJ Rama S. So you, you have a slight passing interest in, in things related to

02:47:13.600 --> 02:47:21.200
this series, right? Yeah, pretty much. I was, I think one of the reasons why it wasn't as crowded

02:47:21.200 --> 02:47:26.240
Saturday is because in order for you to get into the con, you had to cut through the, you had to

02:47:26.240 --> 02:47:31.520
check in. The check-in areas were outside in the parking lot areas in front of the convention

02:47:31.520 --> 02:47:37.120
center. Cause when I walked in, when I walked in, they had, they finally incorporated the

02:47:37.120 --> 02:47:43.920
Q room type setup for everybody to go into. And from that, it just kind of flowed like water.

02:47:43.920 --> 02:47:52.720
What is the secret to not getting a backed up as hell line at your convention? You've

02:47:52.720 --> 02:47:58.720
been to enough conventions. I think that would be it, the Q line, because when it comes to cons,

02:47:58.720 --> 02:48:05.200
people will say, they will stay on the site, pre-regs at this time, people will show up

02:48:05.840 --> 02:48:13.360
one to two hours prior just to get their badge, especially for Otakon. Because during the summer

02:48:13.360 --> 02:48:19.360
in Baltimore, the temperature tends to hit triple digits. And I have seen people out there for three

02:48:19.360 --> 02:48:24.800
and four hours at a time and pretty much in full costumes. It's the same way at AX.

02:48:26.080 --> 02:48:30.080
That's why there's actually this, why this sort of thing started for a little bit of

02:48:30.080 --> 02:48:37.600
your registration line costume. No, for real, it's a variation of a costume or a character

02:48:37.600 --> 02:48:41.840
that you're doing that is more comfortable to wear in line, but still is, you know,

02:48:42.480 --> 02:48:48.720
acceptable to wear out in the triple digits. Yeah, pretty much. Between you and me, I'd rather

02:48:48.720 --> 02:48:54.320
get to the hotel, relax for a few hours, then head on over, pick up my badge and then go meet

02:48:54.320 --> 02:48:58.800
up with friends to eat. I'd rather do that. I like when AX started doing day before pre-reg

02:48:59.760 --> 02:49:03.200
to pick, where you could pick up your badges the day before the convention

02:49:04.400 --> 02:49:08.640
for everyone who pre-registered, registered so that the lines were left for regular registration.

02:49:08.640 --> 02:49:14.480
Yeah, well, but what things was happening now is even if you pre-reg and you pick up the day

02:49:14.480 --> 02:49:19.760
before, you think that would help? No, you still have people who show up the day of and usually

02:49:19.760 --> 02:49:24.640
out there at five o'clock in the morning just to get a badge. Meanwhile, doors don't open till

02:49:24.640 --> 02:49:29.280
nine. Word of advice, don't wear combat boots that are not adjusted to your feet

02:49:31.040 --> 02:49:33.840
in line for registration or masquerade. Just saying.

02:49:34.640 --> 02:49:38.720
There is a meme I wrote about that I have to post on your wall. You'll appreciate it.

02:49:39.360 --> 02:49:44.480
Just remind me to tell you sometime about the days of my Jill Valentine costume.

02:49:45.520 --> 02:49:48.080
Will do. Playing DDR in combat boots is not fun.

02:49:48.640 --> 02:49:53.120
Sorry. I beat that dress as Ranma. Those sandals, I will never do it again.

02:49:54.080 --> 02:49:58.960
Sorry, I got really quiet there, but I took a moment to go visit the news source that I should

02:49:58.960 --> 02:50:03.120
have been watching this whole time, Jamie's Tumblr, to read about what happened in New York

02:50:03.120 --> 02:50:11.360
Comic-Con. My eyes just rolled so far in the back of my head, I can see my brain. I'm infuriated by

02:50:11.360 --> 02:50:19.040
it. It's just like, I can't. I can't. That's all I can say. I can't believe. I still see how people

02:50:19.040 --> 02:50:23.520
can think that doing something like that is okay. Here's the thing is that somebody in a room

02:50:24.240 --> 02:50:29.520
said, and just if you guys don't know, this cosplayer, again, I'm totally reeling.

02:50:29.520 --> 02:50:31.280
We're gonna leave the bulk of the story for Ranma.

02:50:31.280 --> 02:50:38.880
Yes, we will. This cosplayer that was at the convention was basically sexually harassed

02:50:38.880 --> 02:50:44.080
by this television crew that was trying to film her boobs and things like this. Just really stupid

02:50:44.080 --> 02:50:49.600
shit. But the thing that gets me is that I'm like, somebody sat in a room and said, this is a good

02:50:49.600 --> 02:50:53.360
idea. And for the record, this is why we still need feminism.

02:50:53.520 --> 02:50:56.880
This is why we need common sense.

02:50:58.080 --> 02:51:02.880
And Rob, multiple reports came up about that group right after this popped up.

02:51:04.560 --> 02:51:07.760
And now they're playing chicken saying, well, we're not ever going to go back again.

02:51:07.760 --> 02:51:08.960
They shouldn't exist.

02:51:10.480 --> 02:51:16.800
That's a little, all right. I will keep my mouth shut and let you have the say,

02:51:16.800 --> 02:51:18.240
Tuesday's on my jam session.

02:51:18.240 --> 02:51:22.960
I would love to rant if I didn't have school on Tuesday. I would love to call in and rant.

02:51:23.040 --> 02:51:24.960
You might need to do a pre-taped segment or something.

02:51:25.520 --> 02:51:28.640
You are more than welcome to write up an article for my site if you'd like.

02:51:29.600 --> 02:51:30.000
We'll see.

02:51:30.560 --> 02:51:31.060
All right.

02:51:32.320 --> 02:51:36.560
But let's get back on track here and I'll make this part brief and I'll get out of here.

02:51:36.560 --> 02:51:41.840
Because one thing I have noticed on Saturday, outside of Nintendo,

02:51:42.640 --> 02:51:45.120
no one really cared about gaming at Comic-Con.

02:51:46.880 --> 02:51:51.680
How so? Like people just weren't lining up for it or news wasn't really coming out about it or?

02:51:51.680 --> 02:51:53.360
Nobody was really lining up.

02:51:53.360 --> 02:51:59.040
Capcom had a booth where they had six Strider, uh, displays, uh, DuckTales remastered,

02:51:59.040 --> 02:52:00.960
Monster Hunter, Phoenix Wright.

02:52:00.960 --> 02:52:04.960
Evidently there was still more people lining up to play, uh, DuckTales than it was for Strider.

02:52:05.520 --> 02:52:09.040
Oh, that's, that's, oh my gosh.

02:52:11.040 --> 02:52:17.360
That's, I, I, uh, again, I'm just, uh, I mean, that doesn't make me sad in the same way.

02:52:17.360 --> 02:52:21.680
The other thing made me sad, but it's just like, I just, I, I weep that, uh, Strider,

02:52:21.680 --> 02:52:24.880
no one cares. I, I really hope the sales don't reflect that.

02:52:25.680 --> 02:52:30.960
I, I doubt it, but also everybody was going nuts at the Ubisoft, uh, display because,

02:52:30.960 --> 02:52:33.600
um, they had Just Dance 2014 out.

02:52:36.240 --> 02:52:36.880
Oh boy.

02:52:37.680 --> 02:52:41.680
And I just noticed like while I was recording footage of people dancing, they had some,

02:52:41.680 --> 02:52:45.040
I think a pinball, PC pinball gaming contest going on.

02:52:45.040 --> 02:52:49.040
This girl won and walked away with a high-end Nvidia PC, and I thought that was pretty cool.

02:52:49.040 --> 02:52:54.080
Nice. I think it's pretty cool. There's an ABBA song in Just Dance 2014, just saying.

02:52:54.080 --> 02:53:00.080
All right, Rama, we got to let you go as we can wrap up the show, but, uh, tune into anime jam

02:53:00.080 --> 02:53:04.800
session Tuesday at 6 30 Pacific, 9 30 Eastern right after Electric Sisterhood here in VOG.

02:53:05.440 --> 02:53:06.160
Got that right.

02:53:06.160 --> 02:53:07.360
All right. Take care, buddy.

02:53:07.360 --> 02:53:07.920
All right. You too.

02:53:07.920 --> 02:53:08.400
All right. Bye.

02:53:08.960 --> 02:53:09.520
Bye.

02:53:09.520 --> 02:53:15.280
Sadly, I am going to close up the Skype line so, uh, we can, uh, finish up the show.

02:53:15.280 --> 02:53:17.280
I'm so sorry to those that didn't get through.

02:53:17.280 --> 02:53:20.960
Uh, you can always email us mailbag at orange lounge, radio.com,

02:53:20.960 --> 02:53:22.960
but I still have a few tweets to get through.

02:53:22.960 --> 02:53:26.080
And I don't know if Loki has any last minute stories, but we'll give him a chance to.

02:53:26.720 --> 02:53:29.760
All right, then let's get to the Twitters as soon as I can bring it up.

02:53:29.760 --> 02:53:30.080
All right.

02:53:30.080 --> 02:53:36.160
So Bobby linked us to this article that, uh, says because we all love lists and it was

02:53:36.160 --> 02:53:43.280
literally a list of Game of Thrones characters as video game consoles.

02:53:43.280 --> 02:53:46.080
Now I don't watch Game of Thrones, so I kind of looked at the list going.

02:53:46.080 --> 02:53:47.360
It doesn't make sense to me.

02:53:47.360 --> 02:53:50.880
Um, but it just seems like the type of thing that they're intentionally baiting people

02:53:50.880 --> 02:53:51.920
to share on Facebook.

02:53:52.480 --> 02:53:57.600
Um, which is kind of what some of the internet's turned into and some of what Facebook's turned

02:53:57.600 --> 02:53:58.000
into.

02:53:58.000 --> 02:53:58.640
And I don't know.

02:54:00.000 --> 02:54:03.040
I want to talk about this tweet from ActDeft because I heard about this too.

02:54:03.040 --> 02:54:07.520
ActDeft tweets us saying, I just learned about the existence of a 3DS version of Chocobo

02:54:07.520 --> 02:54:09.760
Racing and sadly it got canned.

02:54:09.760 --> 02:54:12.480
I, I did forget they did announce this.

02:54:12.480 --> 02:54:16.240
Like when the 3DS first came out, they were like, yeah, we're going to make a Chocobo

02:54:16.240 --> 02:54:17.280
Racing game for it.

02:54:17.280 --> 02:54:19.440
Well, it came out this week that that game got canceled.

02:54:20.400 --> 02:54:24.320
And I'm like, oh, I really liked the PlayStation game.

02:54:24.320 --> 02:54:30.080
I know it kind of got mixed reviews and some people didn't feel so hot on the game, but

02:54:30.080 --> 02:54:32.160
I thought the game was really cool.

02:54:32.160 --> 02:54:35.360
So I'm sad they didn't do Chocobo Racing on 3DS.

02:54:35.360 --> 02:54:38.640
I would have enjoyed it, but I guess I'll never get to play it.

02:54:38.640 --> 02:54:39.280
Sniff, sniff.

02:54:40.320 --> 02:54:46.720
Uh, let's see, uh, Tiger Claw sends us a link here and I will read this here.

02:54:46.720 --> 02:54:49.760
Russian government to fund patriotic games.

02:54:51.120 --> 02:54:51.600
Interesting.

02:54:51.600 --> 02:54:57.360
I'm trying to look at this article cause I haven't heard about this, but, uh, let's see.

02:54:57.440 --> 02:55:03.840
He links us to an article at GameSpot.com that says, uh, Russians, Russia's culture

02:55:03.840 --> 02:55:07.920
minister says video games have to be conducive to patriotic education.

02:55:07.920 --> 02:55:10.480
And if you distort history, you could be banned.

02:55:11.360 --> 02:55:14.160
It will help fund the production of patriotic games.

02:55:15.520 --> 02:55:20.480
And it's, uh, comments from, uh, the aid to Russia's culture minister, Vladimir

02:55:20.480 --> 02:55:24.480
Mandinsky said in an interview with a Russian daily newspaper.

02:55:25.280 --> 02:55:30.080
And, um, there are several developers that they're in talks with for games to be released

02:55:30.080 --> 02:55:31.440
through 2014.

02:55:31.440 --> 02:55:36.400
You know, this is interesting because you might think, Oh, government funded video

02:55:36.400 --> 02:55:36.800
games.

02:55:36.800 --> 02:55:38.480
What a crazy idea.

02:55:38.480 --> 02:55:39.040
Not really.

02:55:39.040 --> 02:55:42.480
Cause weren't we just hearing on Bobby Blackwell show a couple of weeks ago, he was

02:55:42.480 --> 02:55:44.480
out there at the CDC game jam.

02:55:44.480 --> 02:55:48.560
I mean, the CDC is a government arm, so, you know, obviously it wasn't necessarily

02:55:48.560 --> 02:55:49.840
funding patriotic games.

02:55:49.840 --> 02:55:55.520
It was funding, you know, awareness of, uh, you know, but I just, I thought it was

02:55:55.520 --> 02:56:00.880
interesting that, uh, there's patriotic games of a different sense, uh, being made

02:56:00.880 --> 02:56:01.120
here.

02:56:02.240 --> 02:56:04.560
Um, let's see if there's any other tweets here.

02:56:04.560 --> 02:56:09.040
I'll read this very kind tweet from a Soutour who says, uh, OLR helps me face the

02:56:09.040 --> 02:56:10.080
week each Sunday.

02:56:10.640 --> 02:56:11.920
Oh, thank you.

02:56:13.520 --> 02:56:14.240
So there you go.

02:56:15.120 --> 02:56:17.360
Uh, and then we also got tweeted this picture.

02:56:17.360 --> 02:56:19.200
I just want to show this dark Sakura.

02:56:19.280 --> 02:56:20.640
It's a from what?

02:56:20.640 --> 02:56:21.040
Sorry.

02:56:21.040 --> 02:56:24.800
Morning Wolf is the name of this tweeter who sent us a picture saying gamer cat

02:56:24.800 --> 02:56:26.960
approves of the classic game of the week.

02:56:26.960 --> 02:56:31.600
And there's gamer cat, uh, curled up next to a copy of the animal crossing strategy

02:56:31.600 --> 02:56:31.840
guide.

02:56:31.840 --> 02:56:34.320
Cause that was last week's classic game of the week.

02:56:35.280 --> 02:56:41.920
We like it when you tweet us your cats and, uh, I think that'll do it for, we

02:56:41.920 --> 02:56:43.840
should have, we should have something.

02:56:43.840 --> 02:56:48.160
I'm going to start this on the orange lounge tumbler called show us your pussy.

02:56:50.000 --> 02:56:51.200
I want pictures of cats.

02:56:52.080 --> 02:56:54.560
Well, those are, there's already a shit ton of those on tumbler.

02:56:54.560 --> 02:56:55.200
What do you have?

02:56:55.200 --> 02:56:56.880
My favorite is get out of there cat.

02:56:57.920 --> 02:56:58.320
All right.

02:56:58.960 --> 02:57:00.240
That's it for Twitter topics.

02:57:00.240 --> 02:57:02.560
So that's going to do it for our show tonight.

02:57:02.560 --> 02:57:03.920

02:57:41.360 --> 02:57:43.200

If you did make it this far in the show, then hopefully you did really like what

02:57:47.200 --> 02:57:47.840
you hear.

02:57:47.840 --> 02:57:50.000
Uh, the nominations are about to close.

02:57:50.000 --> 02:57:54.800

orange launch radio for people's choice and best gaming.

02:58:04.640 --> 02:58:07.600

02:58:07.600 --> 02:58:08.880
They'll, they'll, they'll figure it out.

02:58:08.880 --> 02:58:09.920
We've been nominated before.

02:58:09.920 --> 02:58:14.080
They know we know they know who we are and, uh, yeah, we just, it really helps

02:58:14.080 --> 02:58:15.120
us spread awareness.

02:58:15.120 --> 02:58:17.360
That whole thing I just talked about before, you know, getting the word of

02:58:17.360 --> 02:58:18.320
mouth out there.

02:58:18.320 --> 02:58:20.080
So, uh, yeah, would really appreciate it.

02:58:20.080 --> 02:58:22.720
But if you decide to nominate somebody else, that's cool too.

02:58:22.720 --> 02:58:23.680
Just keep it independent.

02:58:23.680 --> 02:58:24.240
That's all we ask.

02:58:24.240 --> 02:58:25.200
Keep it independent.

02:58:25.200 --> 02:58:27.280
Independence are the ones that need the exposure.

02:58:27.280 --> 02:58:28.960
So, uh, good luck to everybody.

02:58:29.600 --> 02:58:31.120
Um, that's it.

02:58:31.120 --> 02:58:33.760
I guess we'll go around and get everybody's final thought for the night

02:58:33.760 --> 02:58:34.960
and then wrap up and get out of here.

02:58:35.520 --> 02:58:38.080
I will give my final thought thought first tonight.

02:58:38.080 --> 02:58:41.760
And my final thought is I'm going to try very hard the rest of this evening

02:58:41.760 --> 02:58:44.880
to not talk, but doing this show makes me happy.

02:58:44.880 --> 02:58:48.080
And I'm glad I could push through these past few hours to be here with you

02:58:48.080 --> 02:58:48.880
tonight.

02:58:48.880 --> 02:58:51.040
Uh, Loki, your final thought tonight?

02:58:51.040 --> 02:58:53.120
I have plenty of lots of Grand Theft Auto 5 this week.

02:58:53.120 --> 02:58:58.480
And stay tuned to the forums, uh, cause we'll have an exact time and day for

02:58:58.480 --> 02:59:01.520
those VOG gaming nights for Grand Theft Auto online.

02:59:01.520 --> 02:59:05.120
It's might be in the middle of the week now, but we'll see.

02:59:05.760 --> 02:59:06.560
All right.

02:59:06.560 --> 02:59:07.680
You gotta figure that out.

02:59:07.680 --> 02:59:10.080
And last but not least, Dark Soccer, your final thought.

02:59:10.720 --> 02:59:11.680
I'm very grumpy.

02:59:13.120 --> 02:59:13.840
Sorry to hear it.

02:59:14.400 --> 02:59:14.960
All right.

02:59:14.960 --> 02:59:16.320
Uh, that's it guys.

02:59:16.320 --> 02:59:18.000
We're done here at Orange Lounge Radio.

02:59:18.000 --> 02:59:20.800
We will be back next week to do it all again.

02:59:20.800 --> 02:59:25.680
I have a wonderful week in the meantime and, um, keep on gaming and have fun.
