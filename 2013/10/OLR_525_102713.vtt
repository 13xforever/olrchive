Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
There's a host, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:18.000
This week, a fundraiser could lead to the release of an incomplete Sojam and Earl 3 for the Dreamcast.

00:18.000 --> 00:25.000
Nintendo is re-imagining N64 titles for a release on the Wii U, and they may not be the only company reimagining their past titles.

00:25.000 --> 00:27.000
All this and more begins right now.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:36.000 --> 00:44.000
It is Orange Lounge Radio episode number 525, October the 27th, 2013.

00:44.000 --> 00:51.000
My name is Rob Roberts, here with all you guys to talk about video games and gaming culture and so on and so forth with my co-hosts.

00:51.000 --> 00:55.000
First up, the one and only DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
I can't tell it pruning.

00:57.000 --> 01:01.000
You can't be gardening, you're in the kitchen slash studio right now.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
Oh, Animal Crossing.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
She's just like a witch.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
Wow, you actually have a little witches hat for your character.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
Because I paid money for Gracie items.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
Adorable.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
I have the full store now.

01:09.000 --> 01:13.000
Wow, you are like really hardcore into this Animal Crossing stuff, it's no joke.

01:13.000 --> 01:17.000
I have two characters that are mine, and I made one for Julian because I'm bribing him.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
But I'll talk about that during my gaming week.

01:19.000 --> 01:22.000
I'm really surprised you haven't jumped on the Pokemon bandwagon yet.

01:22.000 --> 01:25.000
Although I understand, you know, you've got the finance issues going on right now and everything.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
That is literally the reason.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
Oh, okay.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
I have no job.

01:29.000 --> 01:34.000
Which would make the Pokemon addiction worse should you somehow come across a copy.

01:34.000 --> 01:39.000
Except, you know, every time I've ever played a Pokemon game, I've gone about halfway through it and just completely lost interest.

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
It was like, I'm at the gym, let's play a Pokemon game.

01:41.000 --> 01:48.000
I will say the new one is like way, there's just more excitement and a better coat of paint or just something.

01:48.000 --> 01:52.000
It really energizes that whole brand in a way I haven't felt in a very long time.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
Well, Hanukkah is coming up, so whatever.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
Ask Hanukkah Harry for one.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
No.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
Alright.

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
Actually, what I want for Hanukkah is a job.

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
And then I can buy my own damn Pokemans.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
Well, good luck.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
Yeah.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
Didn't you have an interview last week?

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
I did, but I haven't heard back.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
Alright, fingers in, fingers in.

02:09.000 --> 02:13.000
Okay, do you think it's an encouraging sign when he just says, you have any more questions for me?

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
And I go, yeah, when do I start?

02:15.000 --> 02:18.000
And he said, I like how you think.

02:18.000 --> 02:26.000
And then telling me that the eight people, however many people before me, you know, I'm just, I don't want to go much too into the interview.

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
Sure, sure, sure.

02:27.000 --> 02:30.000
Cross your fingers, cross your toes, light some candles, say a prayer, whatever.

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
I'm trying not to be excited, but I need a prayer circle, Rob.

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
Alright, let's join hands.

02:35.000 --> 02:36.000
Okay.

02:36.000 --> 02:39.000
Joining us in our prayer circle this evening, say hello to Techmaster Loki.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
Hi.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
How you doing, Loki?

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
Doing alright.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
Yeah?

02:43.000 --> 02:51.000
I wanted to get better food for dinner other than McDonald's, but I was too busy looking for UFO parts in Grand Theft Auto.

02:51.000 --> 02:54.000
I was like, wait a minute, is that like a toy for Josh?

02:54.000 --> 02:55.000
Oh, it's a Grand Theft Auto thing.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
Yeah.

02:56.000 --> 03:00.000
I will tell you this, Loki, I came so close to finally jumping on that Grand Theft Auto 5 bandwagon this week.

03:00.000 --> 03:04.000
We were like, we were at Fry's or Best Buy or one of those stores, and I almost did it.

03:04.000 --> 03:08.000
But then I was like, wait, Rob, you have an unopened copy of Grand Theft Auto 4 sitting on your shelf.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
This is not okay.

03:10.000 --> 03:13.000
You can't get on the 5 bandwagon until you at least play some 4.

03:13.000 --> 03:16.000
No, you can get on the 5 bandwagon just fine.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.000
And then Alan is like-

03:17.000 --> 03:22.000
Although, I mean, it will look that much better, but, you know, I still think you can get on the bandwagon without playing 4.

03:22.000 --> 03:26.000
But Alan is like, Alan is like, why don't you just wait?

03:26.000 --> 03:29.000
In like a year there'll be the Steam sale, it'll be 6 bucks on PC.

03:30.000 --> 03:36.000
I mean, granted, we don't really have a PC version confirmed, but we all know it'll probably happen at some point.

03:36.000 --> 03:41.000
So, you know, he's encouraging me to wait, but I'm like, everybody's playing it now.

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
They're having the VoG night now.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
It's fun. You're missing out.

03:46.000 --> 03:50.000
But I need to save my money for the PlayStation 4 and all the games that aren't coming out.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
May I interject one thing real quick?

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
Of course.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
Happy birthday to Act Deft.

03:54.000 --> 04:00.000
Yes, happy birthday, or Feliz Cublianos, because he is one of our favorite Mexican listeners after all.

04:00.000 --> 04:03.000
I know we have a couple folks in Mexico that listen, so I don't want to play favorites too much,

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
but Act Deft has always been a loyal listener of the show and participator,

04:06.000 --> 04:11.000
so I don't mind taking the time out at the top of the show to say happy birthday to Act Deft.

04:11.000 --> 04:17.000
It's not his birthday, but we always are happy to have him here in studio joining us with the show.

04:17.000 --> 04:23.000
Say hello, everybody. It's his un-birthday, so a merry un-birthday to VX JasonXV, or just Jason.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
The other Mexican across the table, no less.

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
How you doing?

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
Just not living in Mexico.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
Quienes.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
Doing good.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
I had something to say.

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
Oh, you don't have to wait a whole other week to hear my voice again.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
Or three hours in this case, two and a half.

04:39.000 --> 04:44.000
Jason, if you didn't know, Jason is the new VO guy for basically VoG network.

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
I mean, Bobby does some of the VOs, but you're slowly kind of taking over,

04:47.000 --> 04:52.000
because since you don't have a show right now, you did have one for a while, right?

04:52.000 --> 04:56.000
Not on a network, not affiliated, but I was doing a podcast with some friends for a while.

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
That was before VoG and all that, right? You were doing that for you?

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
Probably. It was quite a while ago at this point.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
It was all a blur. It was all a blur.

05:03.000 --> 05:06.000
But you do have a great voice, so you've been willing to do some voiceovers,

05:06.000 --> 05:10.000
and I think people finally got sick of Rob with the echoes and all that stuff.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
Well, actually, you volunteered. You just said,

05:12.000 --> 05:17.000
Rob, I'm really sick of hearing that damn filter every week, and I'll do it if you need to know.

05:17.000 --> 05:20.000
So I was like, sure, of course, and you've been doing a great job.

05:20.000 --> 05:26.000
I have my microphone set up, sitting nice and ready. I love my studio slash office set up,

05:26.000 --> 05:31.000
and I thought, hey, Rob can always use an extra hour on Sunday, so this is probably a good idea.

05:31.000 --> 05:37.000
I like to think if the worst ever happened, and OLR and Horde House were both suddenly done,

05:37.000 --> 05:43.000
which I don't even like to think about that, but all things come to an end eventually.

05:43.000 --> 05:46.000
Nothing's on the radar yet, folks. I don't want to scare anybody.

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
But I like to think if these projects were to ever come to an end,

05:49.000 --> 05:55.000
that's kind of what I would want to do. I've been doing this radio amateur stuff so long,

05:55.000 --> 05:59.000
I would have to do something for someone, somewhere.

05:59.000 --> 06:03.000
But I like to think I could just start up another show somewhere, but maybe, I don't know,

06:03.000 --> 06:08.000
maybe in ten years I would not really want to do that anymore, and I'd just do VOs for somebody else.

06:08.000 --> 06:12.000
And you have a ton of expertise that you can provide to someone else for the actual aspects of running a show.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
Oh, inflate my ego more.

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
Producer engineering set up for streaming, recording.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
Keep talking, you're my friend.

06:19.000 --> 06:23.000
There's many, many ways to put together a show, live podcast or otherwise.

06:23.000 --> 06:27.000
Everybody could be better, and somebody with expertise could provide that.

06:27.000 --> 06:33.000
Well, I couldn't do this every week, and I don't think Dark Soccer or Loki or even Jason could do this every week either,

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
if it weren't for the chatters.

06:35.000 --> 06:40.000
So hello to our chat room, live.vognetwork.com, and hello to the podcast listeners as well.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
I don't want you guys to feel neglected.

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
We love everybody who participates with our show in one way or another.

06:45.000 --> 06:48.000
But we do have the live chatters over at live.vognetwork.com.

06:48.000 --> 06:52.000
Tigerclaw says, I wish Rob did the intro with the auto-tune.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
I will say this.

06:54.000 --> 07:02.000
We once were looking at doing a segment on the show that was extra for seeing the virtual console release dates.

07:02.000 --> 07:05.000
Back when the Wii was newer and there was a virtual console every week.

07:05.000 --> 07:08.000
Well, that was right when that app came out on iPhone that was like IMT Paint or whatever.

07:08.000 --> 07:14.000
So we were actually looking at having him do that, but there wasn't any easy way for us to get that MP3 rip.

07:14.000 --> 07:19.000
Because we could rip it through the computer, but it didn't really save MP3, so it just didn't work out.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
But I would have loved to do that segment with auto-tune.

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
So it's funny that you bring it to auto-tune.

07:23.000 --> 07:28.000
I can bring in my headset, because I was dumb enough to buy the headset, or I should say,

07:28.000 --> 07:32.000
the collector's edition of Saints Row the Third that had the auto-tune headset.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
Wow.

07:33.000 --> 07:36.000
Which, spoiler alert, sucks ass.

07:37.000 --> 07:42.000
But, you can if you sort of try to sing, I guess, over it.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
It sort of sounds auto-tuned.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
I don't know.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
You know what?

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
We both have Audition.

07:50.000 --> 07:55.000
All I need to do is sit down for an hour and I can probably figure out how to do it.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
Well, yeah, no, no.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
Keep in mind, this was five years ago.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
We have new toys now that we didn't have five years ago.

08:00.000 --> 08:04.000
But we also don't have extra for as my roommate anymore.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
So that idea is kind of long gone.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
We have the internet.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
We do. We do.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
But there's no virtual console.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
I guess Wii U virtual console games, but it's not...

08:13.000 --> 08:18.000
I remember when the Wii was first out, we were seeing virtual console games all the time.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
It was like three a week.

08:19.000 --> 08:22.000
And on Wii U, they've been trickling through.

08:22.000 --> 08:25.000
I feel like every week we're getting something, but let's be real.

08:25.000 --> 08:28.000
It hasn't been a very strong lineup the past week or so.

08:28.000 --> 08:32.000
I think one week we got tennis and baseball.

08:32.000 --> 08:37.000
And those were like the Nintendo versions, like very basic versions of those games.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
The launch time.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
Yeah, part of the launch lineup.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.000
I mean, they're basically named, for crying out loud.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
That tells you when they came out.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
Yeah, exactly.

08:42.000 --> 08:46.000
We could do the regular PlayStation Plus member awards.

08:46.000 --> 08:47.000
We'll think of something.

08:47.000 --> 08:48.000
We'll think of something.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.000
This auto-tune thing is...

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
We're talking about this way too much.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
All right.

08:52.000 --> 08:55.000
Let's do a kickoff topic before we get into our gaming weeks.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
And we're going to break form a little bit here.

08:57.000 --> 09:00.000
We usually do mailbag later in the show.

09:00.000 --> 09:04.000
But what I'm going to ask Dark Sakura to do, could you open up the email bag for us,

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
Dark Sakura?

09:05.000 --> 09:09.000
Because there was an email in there that I thought was really good and worth talking

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
about here at the top of the show.

09:11.000 --> 09:18.000
So Dark Sakura, if you would dive into the email bag and pull out the email that I licked.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
The email that you licked?

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
Yes, it has the saliva all over it.

09:22.000 --> 09:26.000
While I multitask opening my village for everybody who wanted me to do it.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
Animals can wait.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
Yeah, they can.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
I'm just being nice to people.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
Hey, OLR crew.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
AZHP here.

09:32.000 --> 09:35.000
I wanted to get something off my chest that's been bugging me for a few weeks now.

09:35.000 --> 09:38.000
I had some friends over to play scary games a few weeks ago.

09:38.000 --> 09:42.000
And a lot of them were giving advice on how to play Amnesia.

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
Then I asked them if anyone wanted to play since they had played it before.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
And they said, oh, I haven't played it before.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
I watched a playthrough on YouTube.

09:48.000 --> 09:52.000
This got me kind of bummed out because I feel some of the magic of experiencing the game

09:52.000 --> 09:56.000
together with friends was gone because they knew what was going to happen.

09:56.000 --> 10:00.000
When I discovered that watching scary game playthroughs is actually way more common than

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
I thought.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
Then I discovered.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
Way more common than I thought.

10:04.000 --> 10:08.000
Some of the most popular videos of the game Outlast have millions of views.

10:08.000 --> 10:11.000
Outlast is an indie game and certainly hasn't sold millions of copies.

10:11.000 --> 10:14.000
So prospects for a sequel are slim at this time.

10:14.000 --> 10:18.000
So my question to you guys is, do you think streaming is hurting certain genres of games?

10:18.000 --> 10:22.000
This is a slightly different discussion than Nintendo streaming kerfluffle that happened

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
a few months ago.

10:23.000 --> 10:26.000
Because Nintendo games are often games with excellent gameplay and mechanics that makes

10:26.000 --> 10:30.000
you want to play and want to have your own experience with the game.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
Even after.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
I'm about to get logged out.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
Sorry.

10:35.000 --> 10:38.000
Even after watching someone play it.

10:38.000 --> 10:41.000
But is that necessarily the same for horror games?

10:41.000 --> 10:45.000
After seeing the twists and scares, does that make you want to go out and play the game?

10:45.000 --> 10:50.000
And to play Devil's Advocate, were these people just never going to play these games because

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
they were too scared to play it by themselves?

10:52.000 --> 10:55.000
I feel like with the easy answer being, let's watch a playthrough on YouTube.

10:55.000 --> 10:59.000
These people who watch the stream could have mustered up enough courage to get a friend

10:59.000 --> 11:03.000
or two over and play the game as they are huddled up with blankets over their heads,

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
gripping each other in fear.

11:05.000 --> 11:08.000
Is this something we may lose forever due to streaming?

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
I've rambled enough, but I'd love to hear your thoughts on the issue.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
Keep up the great work.

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
Love always.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
AZHP.

11:13.000 --> 11:16.000
This is a really good question, and that's why I wanted to pull it at the top of the

11:16.000 --> 11:20.000
show as a kickoff topic, because it's also timely with Halloween being this next week.

11:20.000 --> 11:24.000
A lot of people are thinking about scary games, and I'm sure some of you, I don't know

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
if you guys do this or maybe people listening, but...

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
We have to watch Showgirls.

11:28.000 --> 11:32.000
Everybody has their tradition, and mine is watching Showgirls every Halloween because

11:32.000 --> 11:37.000
it's a scary movie, but I'm sure some of you bring people over and you all play Silent

11:37.000 --> 11:38.000
Hill, or you all play Amnesia.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
We've done that at your old place with Exeter.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.000
Yeah, certainly.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
But this is a really good question.

11:43.000 --> 11:48.000
Just in general, and it doesn't even necessarily have to be about scary games, but is this

11:48.000 --> 11:53.000
new technology in this world that we live in as gamers where Twitch TV is getting more

11:53.000 --> 12:00.000
and more popular and all its knockoffs, is this hurting gaming more than we want to admit?

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
No, no one really watches it for the twist.

12:02.000 --> 12:06.000
They watch it for the people reacting to playing the games is really what it is.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
Not me.

12:07.000 --> 12:08.000
I don't really...

12:08.000 --> 12:12.000
I'm with you, because of course my mind is going to go to, if you listen to Hoard House,

12:12.000 --> 12:17.000
you know our buddy Gemet over there is infamous for doing these playthroughs where he screams

12:18.000 --> 12:21.000
at the top of his lungs while playing Slender Man, and people love it.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
They heat it up.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
That's why it's so popular.

12:24.000 --> 12:29.000
It's not really about the game itself, which I mean, the game's good, but it's watching

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
these over the top reactions, which is why people do it, right?

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
Yeah.

12:32.000 --> 12:36.000
I mean, I saw some footage of Amnesia before.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
I just don't remember it.

12:39.000 --> 12:45.000
Well, I remember, and even though I've beaten the game a bajillion times,

12:45.000 --> 12:50.000
I watch playthroughs of Silent Hill 3, because that's my favorite game,

12:50.000 --> 12:53.000
and sometimes I don't feel like putting it in and playing through everything.

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
I just want to watch all the cinematics.

12:56.000 --> 13:01.000
For me, it's more or less that I go back and rewatch scenes of games that I've already played,

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
especially scenes that I really like.

13:04.000 --> 13:08.000
The only game, I think, as far as scary games that I've done that with,

13:08.000 --> 13:11.000
are pretty much games I don't intend to ever play.

13:12.000 --> 13:15.000
I want to see exactly how bad this is type of game.

13:17.000 --> 13:22.000
I'm not as much into Resident Evil anymore, so I watch a playthrough of one of the Resident Evil games

13:22.000 --> 13:25.000
just to keep up on the story, but I don't really want to play it.

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
For me, I don't care.

13:27.000 --> 13:31.000
If someone was like, oh yeah, let's come over and have a bunch of people

13:31.000 --> 13:34.000
while we play through this and make fun of it, that's where you get the fun.

13:35.000 --> 13:38.000
Even if you've already seen it, as long as you're not spoiling it for people,

13:38.000 --> 13:43.000
like your friends were spoiling it for you, then that's the difference.

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
People just need to have a little bit of respect.

13:46.000 --> 13:49.000
If they know you haven't played through it before, they need to keep their big mouth shut.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
I think the emailer brings up a good point, though,

13:51.000 --> 13:56.000
is that there are probably people out there where they're not sure if they want to buy

13:56.000 --> 14:00.000
a scary $10, $15 video game that's out there right now.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
Let's say Outlast, I think, was the example used in the email.

14:02.000 --> 14:05.000
Somebody might not be sure if they want to get that game yet,

14:05.000 --> 14:08.000
so they're sampling a little bit on Twitch TV or whatever,

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
and so they watch somebody play the game, and then they're like,

14:10.000 --> 14:13.000
oh, well, I saw all this scary stuff, so I don't really need to buy it now.

14:15.000 --> 14:18.000
Is that a valid concern for the game makers?

14:18.000 --> 14:21.000
I kind of think it's a decent argument.

14:21.000 --> 14:24.000
Now, I sort of think, though, it's twofold.

14:24.000 --> 14:28.000
I kind of think for every person you convince not to buy the game,

14:28.000 --> 14:33.000
I think there's people you also convince to buy the game that may not have done so before.

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
So I think there is a little bit of both.

14:35.000 --> 14:39.000
There's the bad news and there's good news that we might be neglecting here a little bit.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
Jason, do you have any thoughts on this?

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
And I invite our chat room to respond, too, at luke.com.

14:43.000 --> 14:48.000
I was basically going to say that I agree with what Loki said

14:48.000 --> 14:53.000
in that there's going to be a lot of people that are going to use this as an excuse

14:53.000 --> 14:56.000
to see a game without playing it, whether it's for saving money,

14:56.000 --> 14:59.000
whether it's for something that they just didn't get a chance to play.

14:59.000 --> 15:03.000
But there's nothing wrong with that for the same exact point that you made,

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
in that somebody else can get turned on to this.

15:05.000 --> 15:08.000
A game they didn't hear of, a game they were on the fence for,

15:08.000 --> 15:11.000
they see a tiny little bit of it, it interests them,

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
they want to see the rest of the story around it, and so forth.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
There's a lot of games that come out right now,

15:17.000 --> 15:20.000
and nobody plays every single one of them.

15:20.000 --> 15:25.000
So having something that kind of fills the void of being able to see what a game was,

15:25.000 --> 15:28.000
get a story in a universe that you're interested in,

15:28.000 --> 15:32.000
it's not a bad thing. Everybody does not play all of the same games.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.000
Question for you guys at the table.

15:35.000 --> 15:39.000
Have any of you been convinced to buy a video game because of a live stream?

15:39.000 --> 15:42.000
I want to say I did. I can't remember what it is.

15:42.000 --> 15:49.000
Yeah, well not because of a stream, but it showed a lot of the gameplay in a YouTube video.

15:49.000 --> 15:52.000
That's how I bought Drunken Robot Pornography.

15:52.000 --> 15:56.000
I mean, yeah, it was more of a review, but he played through a good bit of what had been out,

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
and I was like, heck yeah, I want this.

15:58.000 --> 16:01.000
Just listening to the music made me want that game.

16:01.000 --> 16:07.000
I've also picked up indie titles based on going through Twitch and seeing people play.

16:07.000 --> 16:11.000
Surgeon Simulator. 2013.

16:11.000 --> 16:15.000
That video, I had to buy it after watching that.

16:15.000 --> 16:18.000
I can't think of one off the top of my head that I bought,

16:18.000 --> 16:24.000
but I will say that seeing streams convinced me to give Dota 2 a try,

16:24.000 --> 16:28.000
and League of Legends, and I was kind of ignoring those,

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
but because of all the streaming that goes on with that,

16:30.000 --> 16:33.000
I was kind of convinced like, oh, maybe I can try this too.

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
That's actually exactly the same point.

16:35.000 --> 16:40.000
The last time I was out here, I watched The International 3 with some co-workers,

16:40.000 --> 16:43.000
and once Dota 2 was finally available for Steam on Mac,

16:43.000 --> 16:48.000
I jumped on that and had a couple friends teach me how to play the game.

16:48.000 --> 16:52.000
I don't want to say I'm good at it by any stretch of the imagination,

16:52.000 --> 16:55.000
but I'm to the point where I can actually learn on my own

16:55.000 --> 16:59.000
and sometimes hold up in multiplayer matches.

16:59.000 --> 17:02.000
Going to our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com,

17:02.000 --> 17:05.000
SSG100Matt says, I really just like watching my friends play games

17:05.000 --> 17:08.000
and occasionally do hilarious commentary.

17:08.000 --> 17:11.000
AlanAlchemy with a comment that's teasing Gemet,

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
which I'm always here for those.

17:13.000 --> 17:16.000
AlanAlchemy says, and how Gemet takes his hands off the mouse and keyboard

17:16.000 --> 17:20.000
and slaps him over his face and stops playing the game when he hasn't even died yet.

17:20.000 --> 17:23.000
It's hilarious and infuriating.

17:23.000 --> 17:26.000
I'm going to get a nasty call on Skype this week.

17:26.000 --> 17:29.000
God damn it, Rob Roberts. I heard OLR this week, Rob Roberts,

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
and you were talking shit about me again.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
The other side of the coin from this email is party games,

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
because party games don't have something that you can spoil.

17:35.000 --> 17:39.000
You see something livestream that's really fun and you pick it up immediately.

17:39.000 --> 17:44.000
Good point. The first time I saw Mario U was on a livestream.

17:44.000 --> 17:48.000
I didn't buy all that right when it first came out,

17:48.000 --> 17:52.000
so I kind of saw it all that morning.

17:52.000 --> 17:55.000
Let's see. Looking for more comments in our chat room.

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
DarkTetsuya at live.vognetwork.com says,

17:57.000 --> 18:01.000
to me it seems like the horror movie trailers or any trailer in general.

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
Sure, maybe you've seen some of the game,

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
but there's still a good chunk that would surprise you.

18:05.000 --> 18:10.000
BlackWolf, our good pal Bobby BlackWolf, who always does the show before us here at VOG Network,

18:10.000 --> 18:15.000
says, well, I almost bought Final Fantasy XIV because of Sky's livestream,

18:15.000 --> 18:18.000
but I was interested in Hearthstone because of his livestream.

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
Interested and almost.

18:20.000 --> 18:23.000
ActDeft actually said exactly the same thing that I wasn't even thinking about,

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
is that you played Rogue Legacy,

18:25.000 --> 18:28.000
and I'll say this again once we hit our gaming weeks,

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
but I've been playing a good chunk of that.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
Every time I've seen that game, I very much enjoyed it.

18:32.000 --> 18:33.000
It's a good use of your time.

18:33.000 --> 18:34.000
It's a great game.

18:34.000 --> 18:37.000
Let me read another comment here, just a couple more.

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
Duron in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says,

18:39.000 --> 18:43.000
I usually use demos or betas to decide if I want to play a game,

18:43.000 --> 18:46.000
but this is a nice way if those options aren't available.

18:46.000 --> 18:47.000
That's a very good point.

18:47.000 --> 18:50.000
And lastly, I'll say from DungeonBuster here,

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
I was on the fence with Amnesia a while back

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
until I watched a few streams of it and picked it up.

18:54.000 --> 19:01.000
So, I mean, a lot of positive, like, yes, the streaming might be doing more good than bad.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
Not to dismiss the points of the original email, though,

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
but I think there is a little bit of both.

19:05.000 --> 19:08.000
I think there's some of what the emailer was saying,

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
and I think there's the other side of,

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
yeah, but there's also another audience that may not have bought the game

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
that is going to buy the game now,

19:14.000 --> 19:18.000
because it's their friend or somebody they feel a connection to online,

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
in the case of, like, the more popular live streamers,

19:20.000 --> 19:24.000
that, you know, play the game and make it look like a good time.

19:24.000 --> 19:28.000
So, all right, anyhow, that'll do it for that topic.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.000
Let's get into our gaming weeks.

19:29.000 --> 19:34.000
For the record, I actually do totally want to have people in person

19:34.000 --> 19:37.000
for a good Silent Hill 3 playthrough.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
It'll be fun. Good times.

19:39.000 --> 19:42.000
Actually, one comment I do need to respond to in chat.

19:42.000 --> 19:45.000
Codeman says, Rob, have you played Outlast yet?

19:45.000 --> 19:48.000
I have not. Codeman was kind enough to gift me a copy.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
I will say time is running out for me to do that, though,

19:50.000 --> 19:54.000
because Halloween is this week, so stay tuned.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
And you can't see it, but I'm wiggling my eyebrows.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
So stay tuned. That'll probably happen this week.

19:58.000 --> 20:02.000
All right, let us get to the types of video games that we've been playing this week,

20:02.000 --> 20:05.000
and how was your gaming week?

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
DarkSakura, what have you been up to? What have you been playing?

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
I haven't been playing Animal Crossing at all.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
You're not playing it right now.

20:11.000 --> 20:15.000
No, not right now. By the way, Normandy's open.

20:15.000 --> 20:20.000
I played Final Fantasy XIV, and I got on a quest that was really pissing me off,

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
so I just said, screw it, and got my second job.

20:22.000 --> 20:27.000
So I'm at level 10 Thaumaturge, and when I hit 15, maybe tonight,

20:27.000 --> 20:33.000
I'll go back to spamming whatever I have to do as a sorcerer or summoner.

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
I guess. I don't know how that works.

20:35.000 --> 20:43.000
Anyway, so I'm playing that. I got Gone Home, but I haven't started it yet.

20:43.000 --> 20:47.000
I did play some Super Mario 3D World Land, whatever it is.

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
Oh yeah, that's right, because you borrowed that from me last year.

20:49.000 --> 20:54.000
Yes, I did. Whatever 3D stuff. Without the 3D, haha.

20:54.000 --> 20:58.000
I also played some Fractal, and I've played Mass Effect 3.

20:58.000 --> 21:04.000
I've played the first Mass Effect because I bought Choddy the first two games on PC,

21:04.000 --> 21:07.000
and she hasn't been able to get hers to work. I don't know why.

21:07.000 --> 21:12.000
So I've been playing mine to walk her through getting all of her stuff set up.

21:12.000 --> 21:16.000
And now that I'm in the game, I just can't resist rolling another shepherd.

21:16.000 --> 21:22.000
I totally forgot where I was. I have another shepherd that I'm playing as kind of the

21:22.000 --> 21:25.000
let's see if we can get Garrus to go with the specter path,

21:25.000 --> 21:29.000
which we know that doesn't really happen anyway, so whatever. Spoilers!

21:29.000 --> 21:34.000
But I'm playing that one, and I completely forgot where I was.

21:34.000 --> 21:39.000
I haven't even done, like, I think I just finished Novaria, and that's it.

21:39.000 --> 21:46.000
So I was playing those, and I was playing something else.

21:46.000 --> 21:52.000
Oh, Dan has broken out the GameCube and is playing the Mimish Cap.

21:52.000 --> 21:53.000
Oh nice.

21:53.000 --> 21:58.000
He's like, we've had this game for how long? And I've played it for not how long?

21:58.000 --> 22:01.000
I'm gonna play it. So that's what all I've been hearing all morning

22:01.000 --> 22:04.000
is a mix of Animal Crossing music and the Mimish Cap.

22:04.000 --> 22:08.000
Alrighty. There it is, your gaming week. Loki.

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
I only played Grand Theft Auto 5.

22:10.000 --> 22:11.000
What a shock!

22:11.000 --> 22:18.000
I know, shocking. So I've been still trying to go through single player and get 100%,

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
so that's what I've been working on.

22:20.000 --> 22:26.000
I finished the flight school stuff, even though I wanted to throw a controller

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
when it came to some of the plane stuff.

22:28.000 --> 22:32.000
And then I've been doing my collectibles right now.

22:32.000 --> 22:37.000
So I'm going through and finding all the letter scraps and all the spaceship parts.

22:37.000 --> 22:42.000
And I've got about, what, seven letter scraps left and three spaceship parts.

22:42.000 --> 22:49.000
So thankfully, Rockstar has a wonderful map on their social club that I can go in,

22:49.000 --> 22:53.000
and it actually updates as I get stuff so I know, okay, I have to go here,

22:53.000 --> 22:57.000
have to do this, because no one really wants to just wander the map looking for that shit.

22:57.000 --> 23:02.000
I just want it done immediately so I can get on to the next thing.

23:02.000 --> 23:06.000
And then I'm playing a little bit of online at work,

23:06.000 --> 23:10.000
mostly the PlayStation 3 version, so I'm level 17 in that now.

23:10.000 --> 23:15.000
And another VOG gaming night. I think we're gonna take turns on the Fridays,

23:15.000 --> 23:20.000
so we'll probably have one next Friday around 8 o'clock.

23:20.000 --> 23:26.000
Haven't decided if it's gonna be PS3 or 360 yet. Probably 360, so stay tuned for that.

23:26.000 --> 23:29.000
And then, of course, the following week we'll probably do PS3.

23:31.000 --> 23:34.000
Alright, so lots and lots of Grand Theft Auto 5.

23:34.000 --> 23:38.000
And once again, if you want to join the VOG Club on Grand Theft Auto 5,

23:38.000 --> 23:41.000
all the information is in our forums at vognetwork.com.

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
Just click on forums at the top of the screen.

23:43.000 --> 23:51.000
Rockstargames.com. I think it's just slash, yeah, slashcrew slash vognetwork.

23:51.000 --> 23:54.000
And I think last I checked we had 46 people.

23:54.000 --> 23:55.000
Nice.

23:55.000 --> 24:00.000
And we now have 50. We hit 50.

24:00.000 --> 24:03.000
It's climbing. Awesome.

24:03.000 --> 24:08.000
Alright, Jason, our guest here and voiceover guy, what have you been up to?

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
This map is really freaking amazing.

24:10.000 --> 24:14.000
I remember when I learned that it was impossible to 100% Just Cause 2,

24:14.000 --> 24:18.000
that it would have been really nice to have something that just shows us where all the items are

24:18.000 --> 24:25.000
when you get to like a 90-90% completion rate where running all over the continent is just ridiculous.

24:25.000 --> 24:30.000
Oh yeah, I still have a few orbs I have to get in Crackdown, the first one.

24:30.000 --> 24:35.000
Yeah, same problem. Crackdown is even smaller than Just Cause 2 is, but still...

24:35.000 --> 24:40.000
Yeah, something like that that helps you to the most monotonous grinding possible

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
would be incredibly beneficial.

24:42.000 --> 24:46.000
As I said earlier, I've been playing a ton of Rogue Legacy

24:46.000 --> 24:51.000
and ripping my hair out with that collectively as well as FTL, Faster Than Light,

24:51.000 --> 24:56.000
which has been frustrating because even on easy I can't make it all the way across the galaxy

24:56.000 --> 25:00.000
and I've been very disappointed of this constantly.

25:00.000 --> 25:04.000
I mentioned on Twitter last night that I went out to a friend's house down in San Francisco

25:04.000 --> 25:08.000
and I played Artemis, the Starship bridge simulator for the first time.

25:08.000 --> 25:12.000
We played for something like four hours.

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
You gave me glance, have you not heard of this before?

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
No I have not, but it sounds interesting.

25:16.000 --> 25:20.000
Artemis, I don't know what's new, what's old, but basically what it amounts to

25:20.000 --> 25:24.000
is that you have a Starship, up to six of them as a matter of fact.

25:24.000 --> 25:29.000
You run either a server, or I think it's one server per ship,

25:29.000 --> 25:36.000
and you can have up to eight or nine positions that encompass a Starship bridge.

25:36.000 --> 25:42.000
Calms, helm, weapons, engineering, science that actually does shield scanning and whatnot, sector scanning,

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
and then obviously the captain is required.

25:44.000 --> 25:49.000
I think you basically have to have at least two players, but the more you have the better it is.

25:49.000 --> 25:55.000
And you start the game with a given scenario, you have deep space stations,

25:55.000 --> 26:03.000
in our case DS 1-4 to protect wormholes, space whales, minefields that you can use to your advantage

26:03.000 --> 26:07.000
or stop paying attention and destroy yourself very quickly.

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
It's an incredible amount of fun.

26:09.000 --> 26:13.000
By the way, this game is getting a big response in our chat room here at live.vognetwork.com.

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
BlackWolf says, I love Artemis.

26:15.000 --> 26:18.000
Tim trips in chat and says, Artemis is so fun.

26:18.000 --> 26:21.000
And SHG100Matt says, Artemis is at PAX East, right?

26:21.000 --> 26:26.000
I think it was. I don't remember. I didn't go, but I think it was one of those games.

26:26.000 --> 26:31.000
I've seen a ton of footage and the places they can take the main screen, the bridge screen,

26:31.000 --> 26:36.000
and make it gigantic and have all of the stations situated strategically.

26:36.000 --> 26:42.000
There's an immense amount of potential to take that game, make the experience as fun as possible

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
and as good as you want it to be.

26:44.000 --> 26:48.000
I am looking at footage of this game on YouTube that Bobby sent me.

26:48.000 --> 26:51.000
Look at that, a Let's Play I'm using to look at the game.

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
So yeah, this looks like they're having fun.

26:53.000 --> 26:56.000
They're all kind of sitting around the table on all their little laptops yelling at each other.

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
That's cool.

26:58.000 --> 27:01.000
There is an Artemis II version now, which we didn't play.

27:01.000 --> 27:04.000
My voice is a little scratchier than usual.

27:04.000 --> 27:08.000
And that's because between the five of us at my buddy's place,

27:08.000 --> 27:11.000
we were shouting back and forth at each other.

27:11.000 --> 27:18.000
Just in the sheer hectic nature, our engineer was balancing power levels for systems

27:18.000 --> 27:23.000
and didn't always react to the captain or just in advance I would say,

27:23.000 --> 27:27.000
hey engineering, do I have power to maneuverability?

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
That sounds like a lot of fun.

27:29.000 --> 27:30.000
It is so fun.

27:30.000 --> 27:35.000
I got to be honest though, if they were to slap Star Trek onto this,

27:35.000 --> 27:39.000
I know I shouldn't say that because it's an indie game and let it grow and be its own thing,

27:39.000 --> 27:42.000
but I have to say, can you imagine if they could slap Star Trek onto this?

27:42.000 --> 27:45.000
It would basically be a Star Trek LARP.

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
People would so be there.

27:47.000 --> 27:51.000
They tried doing console Star Trek games that just did not take off.

27:51.000 --> 27:55.000
With the intent of being a simulator.

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
Well even Raginator wants to know in our chat room,

27:57.000 --> 28:02.000
does it help to say engage or make it so or speak like Shatner when playing Artemis?

28:02.000 --> 28:10.000
The captain did not take the role of a particular character from any universe like that,

28:10.000 --> 28:14.000
but I would use those words because I was doing helm

28:14.000 --> 28:20.000
and so we would have the rotation of the ship and you can also have a warp or a jump ship.

28:20.000 --> 28:26.000
Jump being you instantly go to a certain place of course and warp the progressively high rate traveling.

28:27.000 --> 28:32.000
He'll give me coordinates and I will say locked in or coordinates engaged or jump engaged,

28:32.000 --> 28:35.000
10 seconds to jump, all that kind of stuff.

28:35.000 --> 28:41.000
We had fun with it and it kind of comes with the territory of us all being the geeks that we are.

28:41.000 --> 28:42.000
Of course.

28:42.000 --> 28:45.000
We didn't take specific characters, but we had a hell of a lot of fun with it.

28:45.000 --> 28:49.000
Tim Trip in our chat room says, I basically pretend it's Star Trek anyways.

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
Okay, it's not just me.

28:51.000 --> 28:55.000
Revision3 has a short little video of this game

28:55.000 --> 29:00.000
and they are all dressed up in Star Trek appropriate attire, uniforms and everything,

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
color appropriate and the whole thing.

29:02.000 --> 29:07.000
I will say that our weapons individual was the space cowboy

29:07.000 --> 29:10.000
and he was playing that character very, very well.

29:10.000 --> 29:14.000
I'm sorry, I'm just cracking up at chat because Tim Trip follows up with saying,

29:14.000 --> 29:19.000
practice is my best Janeway voice, which Xdefer over at Horde House does this so much better than I do.

29:19.000 --> 29:24.000
But you know, that's all Tom Paris, Tom, Harry Kim, Harry Kim, Tom Paris, Tom Paris.

29:24.000 --> 29:27.000
That's all he does is yell those two names over and over, but it's funny.

29:27.000 --> 29:28.000
I've been watching through Voyager.

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
Yeah, it was a good show. It was underrated.

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
So, anyway, all right.

29:32.000 --> 29:33.000
You know what?

29:33.000 --> 29:34.000
What?

29:34.000 --> 29:35.000
No, it wasn't.

29:38.000 --> 29:44.000
Voyager was full of bad decision after bad decision and Janeway going, fuck it, I'm Janeway,

29:44.000 --> 29:47.000
we're in the middle of Delta Space, I don't have to follow shit.

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
And that's the tale of Voyager.

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
I'm not asking for directions.

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
I am the direction.

29:54.000 --> 29:57.000
It's a real trip though to see Janeway on Orange is the New Black.

29:57.000 --> 30:00.000
I'm just saying it's a different role for her.

30:00.000 --> 30:01.000
Okay, anyhow.

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
Oh shit, that was her.

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
I didn't even realize it after watching.

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
No, it didn't even click.

30:07.000 --> 30:08.000
Wow.

30:09.000 --> 30:14.000
And there's also McCoy on some cops SWAT something I saw a commercial for.

30:15.000 --> 30:19.000
Obviously, Abram vs. McCoy is on some new TV show and that's quite a jump.

30:19.000 --> 30:20.000
Oh my God.

30:20.000 --> 30:23.000
I love you Game Guru because you know SF Debris.

30:23.000 --> 30:29.000
If you ever want to see the funniest mockery of the Janeway voice ever, go to SF Debris.

30:30.000 --> 30:33.000
I was going to say, you know, Voyager had some pretty epic guest stars.

30:33.000 --> 30:36.000
Like Sarah Silverman was a guest star on an episode of Voyager.

30:36.000 --> 30:40.000
And she wasn't being her typical over the top hilarity.

30:40.000 --> 30:43.000
She was playing it serious, so it's so funny to see her on the show.

30:44.000 --> 30:47.000
You know, like, I'm going on the Voyager.

30:47.000 --> 30:52.000
I just can't help but think always though of Maria Bamford doing her,

30:52.000 --> 30:56.000
I used to work at the Star Trek experience as a Bajoran.

30:56.000 --> 30:59.000
Her Bajoran refugee voice.

30:59.000 --> 31:02.000
I can never get that out of my head whenever I think of Star Trek.

31:02.000 --> 31:07.000
Bobby Black Wolf says, I hear Orange is the New Black is better if you pretend it's just Janeway in the holodeck.

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
It could be her fantasy.

31:10.000 --> 31:13.000
This is getting way too far away from video games. Way too far.

31:13.000 --> 31:16.000
Just the expanse of the Star Trek universe.

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
Look what this Artemis game does to people.

31:18.000 --> 31:19.000
Alright, I'm kidding.

31:19.000 --> 31:25.000
I think we've also just admitted that we know way too much about Voyager than we should say in public.

31:26.000 --> 31:29.000
I know nothing about Voyager other than, you know...

31:30.000 --> 31:35.000
I will however watch an entire season of Voyager before I watch any more Enterprise.

31:35.000 --> 31:36.000
There you go.

31:36.000 --> 31:40.000
You know, true story, the first time I ever got drunk was at the Star Trek experience.

31:40.000 --> 31:43.000
First time in my life I ever got drunk was at the Warp Core Breach.

31:43.000 --> 31:44.000
I love those things.

31:44.000 --> 31:49.000
Fucking Travis over at Understation Live here at VOG Network has the voicemail thing.

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
Anyway, long story that I'm not going to recap.

31:51.000 --> 31:55.000
By the way, I did find in Las Vegas a replacement for the Warp Core Breach.

31:55.000 --> 31:56.000
Oh, what's that?

31:56.000 --> 31:59.000
It's at this place at the Paris casino.

31:59.000 --> 32:06.000
Their little dessert bar, whatever place, has fuzzy drinks with foam coming up out of it like the Warp Core Breach.

32:06.000 --> 32:09.000
And whatever their red one is tastes like Warp Core Breach.

32:09.000 --> 32:10.000
Nice.

32:10.000 --> 32:13.000
I just don't remember what it was called. It was red and I was drunk.

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
Nice. I gotta go to Vegas one of these times.

32:15.000 --> 32:20.000
A friend of mine is trying to talk me into going to New Media Expo, which I think is right around the time as CES.

32:20.000 --> 32:24.000
So it's like, oh, if I could do a double and do both those cons it would be a lot of fun.

32:24.000 --> 32:28.000
But anyway, let's talk about my gaming week and the type of stuff that I've been playing this week.

32:28.000 --> 32:33.000
Which, you know, much like Loki, I still have been playing plenty of Final Fantasy XIV.

32:33.000 --> 32:36.000
We perfected earlier today speedruns of Wanderer's Palace.

32:36.000 --> 32:39.000
Which, if you know the endgame, that's one of the instances that you can do in the endgame.

32:39.000 --> 32:42.000
And we're able to knock that place out in about 15 minutes.

32:42.000 --> 32:47.000
Which doesn't beat the record of 8 minutes, but it's still pretty good considering we don't have the optimal group.

32:47.000 --> 32:50.000
But anyway, other games I've been playing this week.

32:50.000 --> 32:55.000
Not a whole lot of new stuff, but I did play a new port of a game I already played.

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
And that's Hotline Miami.

32:57.000 --> 33:02.000
Because Hotline Miami is free on PlayStation Plus right now on PlayStation 3 and PS Vita.

33:02.000 --> 33:06.000
And if you are a PlayStation Plus subscriber, you really do need to check out this game.

33:06.000 --> 33:10.000
I can't confess to having played a lot of it.

33:10.000 --> 33:16.000
Just because it's really difficult and kind of, like, it takes a bit of getting used to the game.

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
But I really like the style.

33:18.000 --> 33:23.000
It's got, you know, a very retro style to it, but the soundtrack is so good.

33:23.000 --> 33:24.000
And I'm sure a lot of people are...

33:24.000 --> 33:25.000
Isn't it?

33:25.000 --> 33:26.000
Oh yeah, it's great.

33:26.000 --> 33:27.000
I love the soundtrack.

33:27.000 --> 33:30.000
I just sit there and listen to that on loop as I'm dying over and over.

33:30.000 --> 33:35.000
But it's a very fast-paced game, and in the retro sense, I find a lot of it is about memorization.

33:35.000 --> 33:41.000
Like, okay, here, you're going to go onto this floor in this house that you're invading for whatever reason.

33:41.000 --> 33:45.000
And I'm going to go kill that guy, and then I'm going to take his weapon, and then go kill that guy, and that guy.

33:45.000 --> 33:48.000
And then I've got to run over here and lure that guy out so I can kill him.

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
Like, you start to think of the memorization.

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
Like, it's a Mega Man level or something, like in retro.

33:52.000 --> 33:55.000
So, you know, I know that it's a lot of trial and error.

33:55.000 --> 34:00.000
But unfortunately for me, I tend to error a lot more than I do succeed.

34:00.000 --> 34:04.000
But it's something about the soundtrack of that game kind of, like, gets you going.

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
And yeah, I want to play more of that.

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
So I was having a lot of fun with that on PlayStation 3.

34:08.000 --> 34:12.000
So again, if you have PlayStation Plus, check it out.

34:12.000 --> 34:13.000
It's free.

34:13.000 --> 34:16.000
You really have no reason at this point not to.

34:16.000 --> 34:19.000
And even, I'm sure it'll be discounted on Steam.

34:19.000 --> 34:22.000
And I don't think it's a very expensive game to begin with on any of the platforms it's on.

34:22.000 --> 34:28.000
So it's worth the money if you like old retro puzzle memorization games.

34:28.000 --> 34:33.000
And if you like an abundance of violence with your retro games.

34:33.000 --> 34:37.000
Because I will tell you, there's an abundance of violence in this game.

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
And shooting dogs.

34:39.000 --> 34:42.000
Alan Alchemy in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com backing us up.

34:42.000 --> 34:45.000
It absolutely needs memorization to get through it.

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
So, all right.

34:47.000 --> 34:48.000
Let's see.

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
Other games that I've been playing this week.

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
I did play a game.

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
It's not a new game, but it's new to me.

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
It's called Midway Arcade Origins.

34:56.000 --> 34:59.000
Which is a retro game collection that's available.

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
I think it's on 360 and PS3.

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
Don't know about Wii or Wii U.

35:03.000 --> 35:04.000
I don't think it's there.

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
I think it's only on the others.

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
Here's the thing.

35:08.000 --> 35:11.000
The Midway game collection's kind of been done before.

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
And I actually rented this.

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
Because I was a little hesitant to buy it.

35:15.000 --> 35:20.000
Because, well, I already have Midway Arcade Treasures on PlayStation 2.

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
Like, there's three different volumes of it, right?

35:22.000 --> 35:23.000
I have all three volumes.

35:23.000 --> 35:27.000
So most of the games in this I already have in one way or another.

35:27.000 --> 35:31.000
And I think they even had on the PlayStation 1 some of these games were available.

35:31.000 --> 35:35.000
And it's kind of funny because some of these games we've seen before this generation.

35:35.000 --> 35:39.000
Joust was an early $5 Xbox Live arcade game.

35:39.000 --> 35:42.000
And that's in the collection now for, you know, what?

35:42.000 --> 35:46.000
I find this for $19.99 on Amazon at this point or gaming stores to buy this new.

35:46.000 --> 35:49.000
And I'm trying to think of some of the other games.

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
I think Defender. Wasn't Defender an Xbox Live game at some point too?

35:51.000 --> 35:52.000
I think they redid that.

35:52.000 --> 35:55.000
Well, anyway, those are some of the games that are in the collection.

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
Some of the other highlights for me.

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
Marble Madness. Love that game, right?

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
That's in the collection.

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
Rampart is a personal favorite of mine.

36:03.000 --> 36:08.000
That's the game that's like Tetris meets you roll the trackball around and shoot things.

36:08.000 --> 36:09.000
The ships.

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
I don't know if you guys know this game.

36:11.000 --> 36:14.000
Rampart was really cool. Google it if you haven't heard of it yet.

36:14.000 --> 36:17.000
Or maybe Dark Soccer will do it as a classic game later.

36:17.000 --> 36:18.000
Maybe.

36:18.000 --> 36:19.000
Don't you like Rampart?

36:19.000 --> 36:20.000
Not really.

36:20.000 --> 36:27.000
But I will tell you, this was the game that I don't think was in any of the older collections that I was really giddy.

36:27.000 --> 36:30.000
And it's Super Offroad.

36:30.000 --> 36:33.000
Which originally used to be Iron Man Stewart's Super Offroad.

36:33.000 --> 36:36.000
But I guess since, you know, they don't have the license with him anymore.

36:36.000 --> 36:39.000
Just like Punch Out isn't Mike Tyson anymore.

36:39.000 --> 36:42.000
Exactly. They gave him a mustache and just photoshopped his name out.

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
So now it's just Super Offroad or whatever.

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
But I had a lot of fun playing that game.

36:46.000 --> 36:52.000
Although I will say, it loses a little something when you don't have the steering wheel that you can just spin around uncontrollably.

36:52.000 --> 36:55.000
Remember, like, they were totally fake steering wheels.

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
And they had no stop on the left or the right side.

36:57.000 --> 37:01.000
So when you were a kid, you would just spin that thing like crazy when you're trying to turn around.

37:01.000 --> 37:02.000
And it was a lot of fun.

37:02.000 --> 37:06.000
It doesn't translate the same way to the thumb sticks.

37:06.000 --> 37:09.000
But it's an awful lot of fun to kind of have that whole experience.

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
Because I don't remember an arcade perfect version of that.

37:11.000 --> 37:14.000
I know on the NES they had a version of that.

37:14.000 --> 37:19.000
But it was a little, you know, scaled down in the graphics and so forth.

37:19.000 --> 37:24.000
Although it was one of the few, if I remember, it was one of the few four player multi-tap games on the NES.

37:24.000 --> 37:25.000
If I'm not mistaken.

37:25.000 --> 37:29.000
They redid it on the SNES too that dramatically improved on the NES version.

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
I don't think it was arcade perfect.

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
And, you know, probably intentionally so.

37:33.000 --> 37:37.000
The lack of credits and coins and the need to re-up and that kind of thing.

37:37.000 --> 37:43.000
Yeah, I remember when I was a kid, if ever there was a Super Off-Road strategically positioned in a walkable area.

37:43.000 --> 37:50.000
I would walk by and just throw all the steering wheels so they're all spinning uncontrollably in the same direction.

37:50.000 --> 37:57.000
DarkTetsuya and GameGuru, both in our chatroom, telling me that Midway Treasures 3 actually did have Super Off-Road in it.

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
I just don't remember that.

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
And to be honest, I'm looking over at my collection.

38:01.000 --> 38:04.000
I actually have Midway Arcade Treasures 1 and 2, so I guess I never picked up 3.

38:04.000 --> 38:07.000
3 had Hydro Thunder and it was all racing games, right?

38:07.000 --> 38:08.000
I wonder why I skipped that one.

38:08.000 --> 38:12.000
I remember having to seek out 3 on the PS2 for a very specific purpose.

38:12.000 --> 38:16.000
And I don't think it was Off-Road, but I know there was some other game that I wanted in it.

38:16.000 --> 38:20.000
So anyway, as far as retro classic game collections go, it's fine.

38:20.000 --> 38:23.000
Especially if you don't have these games already in one way or the other.

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
It's kind of neat to have them again.

38:25.000 --> 38:29.000
And yeah, they've got the leaderboard and the trophies and, you know, that's that.

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
Otherwise, you know, not a lot to scream about.

38:31.000 --> 38:37.000
But if you're a retro gaming fan, it's really nice to see them in the crisp HD.

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
And you can put different filters on the graphics too.

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
You can have it super sharp or smooth, you know.

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
So you can do those little things.

38:43.000 --> 38:50.000
And, you know, especially now that the title is a budget title, it would be worth your time if you like retro games.

38:50.000 --> 38:53.000
Anyhow, that does it for my gaming week.

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
So let's quickly do some housekeeping.

38:56.000 --> 38:59.000
Don't forget you can add us on Twitter, twitter.com slash o-l-r.

38:59.000 --> 39:02.000
And we're also on Facebook, facebook.com slash orange lounge radio.

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
We appreciate all our friends on those sites.

39:04.000 --> 39:07.000
We're also on Google Plus, as we'll get to later in the show.

39:07.000 --> 39:14.000
And I do want to remind you guys, I mentioned this last week and just want to remind you guys, there will be no new show in two weeks.

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
We will have the night off.

39:16.000 --> 39:20.000
So we'll be here next week on November 3rd, if I'm thinking right with the dates.

39:20.000 --> 39:26.000
But we will not be here on November 10th, because I will be coming back from Los Angeles and my not BlizzCon trip.

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
And I get to trash your house.

39:28.000 --> 39:31.000
Dark Sakura will be house sitting and Kitty sitting.

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
I got paid in Duffy.

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
Yes, as she kindly offered to do.

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
I would have done it for free.

39:37.000 --> 39:38.000
I know.

39:38.000 --> 39:39.000
But thanks for the Duffy.

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
You're welcome. I've been sitting on that for like three months.

39:41.000 --> 39:42.000
Now?

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
Not literally.

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
But anyway, yeah, we won't be here November 10th.

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
I'm going on my not BlizzCon trip.

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
You'll probably hear more about this on Horde House.

39:50.000 --> 39:55.000
But I missed out on getting BlizzCon tickets because I thought I would be doing something else that weekend.

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
And it unfortunately fell through.

39:57.000 --> 40:00.000
It's kind of a sad situation, but it is what it is.

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
And I'm no longer going to Phoenix.

40:02.000 --> 40:06.000
So I said, fine, I'll go to BlizzCon, except there's no way I can get a ticket now.

40:06.000 --> 40:10.000
And, you know, BlizzCon is a fortress to get in its media.

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
You're either on their list or you're not.

40:12.000 --> 40:17.000
So I'm just going to go to the parties and then go to Disneyland, which is BlizzCon enough, right?

40:17.000 --> 40:18.000
BlizzCon.

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
Yeah, exactly. I'm making a BlizzCon out of it. Why not?

40:20.000 --> 40:25.000
Well, seriously, you run into people in the park because I did that a couple years ago when they...

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
Not when they... They didn't have it last year, but the year before.

40:27.000 --> 40:28.000
Right, yeah.

40:28.000 --> 40:31.000
I actually would run into people who are wearing like WoW t-shirts and say,

40:31.000 --> 40:34.000
BlizzCon! And they go, hell yeah!

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
So yeah, that'll be on Sunday.

40:36.000 --> 40:40.000
That was when I was really into WoW and Dan would just roll his eyes and go wander in the other direction.

40:40.000 --> 40:44.000
Yeah, BlizzCon is on the Sunday, the official BlizzCon, but we're making a run of it.

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
I'm going to be going to an event. I should plug this.

40:46.000 --> 40:50.000
If you're going to be at BlizzCon and for whatever reason you're not listening to Horde House, my other show,

40:50.000 --> 40:55.000
I'm going to be at an event called World of Podcasts, which is Thursday night. I'll be there.

40:55.000 --> 41:00.000
I'm not featured because, again, I wasn't planning on going, so I missed the boat on all that stuff.

41:00.000 --> 41:03.000
But Grandpa from our show is on one of the panels over there.

41:03.000 --> 41:06.000
So yeah, I'll be at World of Podcasts, so if you're going to be there, come say hi.

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
And say hi to Grandpa as well.

41:08.000 --> 41:12.000
And then I don't know, whatever else I get invited to Friday or Saturday, we'll go to that too.

41:12.000 --> 41:16.000
Although Alan and I are going to try to do a Carthay Circle dinner one of those nights.

41:16.000 --> 41:20.000
Probably Saturday night, because I think that's when the closing ceremonies are,

41:20.000 --> 41:23.000
so there's usually not a lot going around because they usually have a big old concert.

41:23.000 --> 41:27.000
Although they didn't announce any big, there's no Ozzy Osbourne or anything this year.

41:27.000 --> 41:30.000
So I don't know what they're doing for the closing ceremonies. It's got to be a secret.

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
It's a secret to everybody.

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
It is a secret to everybody.

41:34.000 --> 41:39.000
Alright, let's move on with some gaming news.

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
And Loki, going to start us off tonight.

41:41.000 --> 41:46.000
Alright, there's a rumor that's, I guess, going on, saying that there's going to be a brand new...

41:46.000 --> 41:51.000
Sorry, you know it's a slow gaming week when we have to start off, or a slow news week in gaming,

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
when we have to start off with a rumor.

41:53.000 --> 41:57.000
So I apologize in advance, but it's not the best week in news.

41:57.000 --> 41:58.000
There's nothing to talk about.

41:58.000 --> 42:02.000
Yeah, we're stretching tonight. Fully admitting. Fully admitting.

42:02.000 --> 42:08.000
Like, Lisa, I'm not covering that story about NASCAR being, you know, the rights for NASCAR going to Deep Silver,

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
because no one fucking cares.

42:11.000 --> 42:17.000
Anyways, I know there's Regnut out there who still has his gaming console that he stole.

42:17.000 --> 42:25.000
So there's this series that, I guess, they're calling Reimagined, because that's dumb.

42:25.000 --> 42:32.000
It's supposed to be, I guess, seven Nintendo 64 games that are being redone in HD.

42:32.000 --> 42:39.000
And, God, I hope they're really actually redoing everything if they're actually going to do this and not just upresing them,

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
because it's going to look like shit.

42:41.000 --> 42:44.000
It's also going to look weird, too, because they're not going to be all fuzzy and cloudy anymore.

42:44.000 --> 42:51.000
They're also saying that, I guess, all seven games would feature new content and retail at $30.

42:51.000 --> 43:00.000
And the idea is, I guess, Nintendo would be filling in the gaps in their Wii U lineup by re-releasing older Nintendo 64 games.

43:00.000 --> 43:04.000
Here's kind of a funny part, though, about that, is they are already filling...

43:04.000 --> 43:11.000
Well, I should say their lineup is already including older games that are being remade, like Wind Waker HD, for example.

43:11.000 --> 43:20.000
Or even before the Wii U, they had their new play control games, which they literally did nothing to except for change the control on it.

43:20.000 --> 43:26.000
Oh, hey, now it uses a Wii remote instead of a GameCube controller, because that's so much better.

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
It's not, though.

43:29.000 --> 43:34.000
And, yeah, one of the rumors, of course, is that Mario 64 is going to be the first game.

43:34.000 --> 43:37.000
Yeah, of course it's going to be Mario 64.

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
They're not going to do Superman 64.

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
Hey, let's leave with that.

43:41.000 --> 43:44.000
Mario Kart 64 would cannibalize a little bit on Mario Kart 8.

43:44.000 --> 43:50.000
I don't think... I mean, I could see them doing something like this, but I would think, if anything,

43:50.000 --> 43:56.000
I just don't know how much of a draw there's really going to be for people to get HD versions of these games.

43:56.000 --> 44:02.000
I mean, I'm sure some people will be interested in it, but I don't know.

44:02.000 --> 44:06.000
I would think they'd be better off just doing, like, you know...

44:06.000 --> 44:12.000
I could see this maybe for, you know, the 3DS, because remember they did this with, like, you know,

44:12.000 --> 44:19.000
Alcarina and Star Fox and that kind of stuff. I could see that happening, but...

44:21.000 --> 44:24.000
I don't know. It just sounds like a rumor to me. Whatever.

44:25.000 --> 44:33.000
Well, you know, I realize it's a big old rumor, and Nintendo remaking their games wouldn't exactly be out of character for them or whatever, right?

44:33.000 --> 44:34.000
No, yeah.

44:34.000 --> 44:42.000
But, you know, it seems like it's not a very long process for them, and the games turn out pretty well received.

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
Like, I'm thinking of the Zelda Wind Waker HD thing.

44:44.000 --> 44:50.000
Yeah, but the problem with Wind Waker HD, though, is that it had way better graphics than, you know, the GameCube...

44:50.000 --> 44:56.000
Well, because it was a GameCube game. It wasn't that different than, you know, a regular Wii game or something like that.

44:56.000 --> 45:00.000
So it wasn't... They weren't doing a whole lot.

45:00.000 --> 45:08.000
Whereas if you were doing Mario or, like, any of the Nintendo 64 stuff, you're going to have to do quite a bit to that to make it look nice.

45:08.000 --> 45:14.000
Because just up-resing it and making the polys look nicer and stuff, it's going to look like...

45:14.000 --> 45:21.000
I mean, fuck, you can just pull it up on YouTube and look at any of the emulators out there that do any sort of up-scaling on that stuff, and it just...

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
It doesn't look that good.

45:23.000 --> 45:29.000
Like, even when I ran stuff in, like, an emulator on, like, the Ouya and stuff, and that sort of did some up-resing and stuff,

45:29.000 --> 45:36.000
it just doesn't look good on your TV because, yeah, everything's smoother looking, but it's just so empty because those games, you know, couldn't...

45:36.000 --> 45:43.000
They couldn't do very far draw distances or, you know, they didn't have a lot of detail in there because it couldn't handle it.

45:43.000 --> 45:46.000
It's just... I don't know.

45:46.000 --> 45:50.000
It's a neat idea, but I just don't know how well it's going to look.

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
We'll see, I guess.

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
SSJ100Matt with a comment in our chat room.

45:54.000 --> 46:00.000
At live.vognetwork.com, the recent Mario Kart games have had the older tracks remade into the new games.

46:00.000 --> 46:03.000
That's another good reason why a Mario Kart 64 would be a little redundant.

46:03.000 --> 46:07.000
Yeah, you know, as much as I like playing the older tracks, I think that's such a cop-out of, like,

46:07.000 --> 46:11.000
hey, look, we get double the content now without having to do anything.

46:11.000 --> 46:15.000
Well, it would be really... I do think they could release a bunch of old tracks as DLC.

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
I think that would be really cool.

46:17.000 --> 46:18.000
So why not?

46:18.000 --> 46:21.000
Why not have the balls and put a fucking track editor in there?

46:21.000 --> 46:25.000
Oh, you afraid that people are going to come up with better track designs than your own?

46:25.000 --> 46:29.000
But, Loki, somebody might draw a penis as a track.

46:29.000 --> 46:32.000
Not me. I've decided I know what track I would design.

46:32.000 --> 46:33.000
Boobs.

46:33.000 --> 46:34.000
No, even better.

46:34.000 --> 46:35.000
What?

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
I would have the full-on vag track.

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
You know, with the little lube.

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
I knew you were dirtying it up somewhere.

46:41.000 --> 46:42.000
Oh, come on.

46:42.000 --> 46:46.000
I think it's, like, totally unfair to automatically assume that people are going to put a penis in

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
when it is much better to put a vag in.

46:48.000 --> 46:49.000
Well, my next guess was boobs.

46:49.000 --> 46:50.000
Oh, okay. I'll tell you why.

46:50.000 --> 46:53.000
I'll tell you why it's easy for people to put a penis in there, because

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
who is the demographic for these games?

46:55.000 --> 46:58.000
Teenage boys and prepubescent boys.

46:58.000 --> 46:59.000
What have they seen?

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
They've seen their penis.

47:01.000 --> 47:02.000
What have they not seen?

47:02.000 --> 47:03.000
They have not seen a vagina.

47:03.000 --> 47:06.000
And this would be the only way they ever would.

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
So, of course, it's gonna-

47:09.000 --> 47:10.000
I would be doing them a favor.

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
It's familiar territory.

47:12.000 --> 47:15.000
You didn't see fucking Bob Ross painting buildings and cars.

47:15.000 --> 47:18.000
You saw him painting trees, because that's the way he knew.

47:18.000 --> 47:19.000
He knew trees.

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
Just like kids, they know penises.

47:21.000 --> 47:22.000
And bushes.

47:22.000 --> 47:26.000
If you want to be technical, it had to do with his painting style, but that's a different thing.

47:26.000 --> 47:29.000
God dammit, I want to see a fuzzy fucking building.

47:29.000 --> 47:30.000
He can do it.

47:30.000 --> 47:31.000
Alan Alchemy.

47:31.000 --> 47:32.000
From the grave.

47:32.000 --> 47:36.000
Alan Alchemy in our chatroom at live.voguenetwork.com suggesting a name for your track, Dark Soccer,

47:36.000 --> 47:37.000
of Vulva Vroom.

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
I approve of this.

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
It will officially be called the Vulva Vroom.

47:41.000 --> 47:47.000
I think Dark Soccer should have, like, a sex education game on the Wii U.

47:47.000 --> 47:51.000
Like, you know, instead of Dr. Joyce Brothers or whatever, or Dr. Ruth-

47:51.000 --> 47:52.000
Foost, do you lose-

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
I can't do the Dr. Joyce.

47:54.000 --> 47:58.000
No, it'll be more like the sex education teacher in Beavis and Butthead.

47:58.000 --> 47:59.000
Dark Soccer would just walk out.

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
Today we're gonna talk about the penis.

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
We're gonna talk about the vagina.

48:03.000 --> 48:04.000
That's the coach.

48:04.000 --> 48:05.000
Oh yeah, I'm sorry.

48:05.000 --> 48:06.000
Whatever he was.

48:06.000 --> 48:07.000
Isn't he the same guy?

48:07.000 --> 48:08.000
Yeah.

48:08.000 --> 48:09.000
He'd feel like all the alternative-

48:09.000 --> 48:10.000
Coach Buzzcut.

48:10.000 --> 48:11.000
Yeah.

48:11.000 --> 48:12.000
Kick me in the jibby.

48:12.000 --> 48:20.000
So is that like, you know, Mario teaches typing, it's Birdo teaches sex ed or something like that?

48:20.000 --> 48:25.000
Teaching- this is all the stuff that I didn't want and I had it changed.

48:25.000 --> 48:29.000
So, you could even have it on the Wii U.

48:29.000 --> 48:34.000
You could be like, now touch where you're gonna find the G spot.

48:34.000 --> 48:39.000
And then the person touches, no, this is why you'll never get laid.

48:39.000 --> 48:42.000
Show me on the touchpad where they touched you.

48:42.000 --> 48:45.000
You get the orgasm trophy.

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
They don't have trophies on Wii U, Dark Soccer.

48:47.000 --> 48:50.000
Well, I don't have a Wii U, so I don't care.

48:50.000 --> 48:55.000
And-

48:55.000 --> 48:56.000
Was there more with that, Loki?

48:56.000 --> 48:57.000
I'm sorry.

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
I think I cut you off and suddenly we-

48:59.000 --> 49:00.000
No, we were done talking.

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
We were in playground chat at that point.

49:02.000 --> 49:03.000
We were done talking.

49:03.000 --> 49:04.000
It's a rumor.

49:04.000 --> 49:05.000
Rumor, rumor, rumor.

49:05.000 --> 49:06.000
Rumor, rumor, rumor.

49:06.000 --> 49:10.000
There's another joke there about the name of the game and for some strange reason I

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
just can't put the words together.

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
Something something and we use-

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
What was the name of this game?

49:16.000 --> 49:17.000
Reumagined?

49:17.000 --> 49:18.000
Reumagined, yes.

49:18.000 --> 49:19.000
Reumagined.

49:19.000 --> 49:23.000
It honestly sounds like a special episode of RuPaul's Drag Race.

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
Like, Ru-U-magined or something.

49:25.000 --> 49:26.000
Is that what they're calling it?

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
Is that what the Lost episodes that they're calling it on TV right now?

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
You know I've never watched an episode of that.

49:30.000 --> 49:31.000
The Ruvives episodes.

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
How are we friends?

49:33.000 --> 49:34.000
I mean to.

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
I used to watch Drag U.

49:36.000 --> 49:37.000
Oh, okay.

49:37.000 --> 49:38.000
Well, similar.

49:38.000 --> 49:39.000
Then you know enough.

49:39.000 --> 49:44.000
Because I like seeing, as much as Ru makes a gorgeous woman, I loved the suits.

49:44.000 --> 49:45.000
It was all about the suits.

49:45.000 --> 49:46.000
That red suit.

49:46.000 --> 49:47.000
Ah.

49:47.000 --> 49:48.000
Tim Tripp in our chat says,

49:48.000 --> 49:51.000
I just had a moment where I thought I was listening to Hoard House, but we didn't have

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
Grandpa say something racially insensitive.

49:53.000 --> 49:56.000
So it's not truly an episode of Hoard House at this point.

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
Let's move on quickly before we go there.

49:58.000 --> 50:02.000
Maybe I'm just channeling X to fur in an entirely feminine manner.

50:02.000 --> 50:05.000
I haven't brought up, you know, bleaching the part.

50:05.000 --> 50:09.000
Next story is about Nintendo as well.

50:09.000 --> 50:12.000
Talking about cross-play titles.

50:12.000 --> 50:18.000
You know right now most cross-play we think of on PlayStation with PS3 or 4 and the PlayStation Vita.

50:18.000 --> 50:21.000
In fact Hotline Miami, I was talking about earlier in the show.

50:21.000 --> 50:24.000
When you download that you get a Vita version and a PlayStation 3 version.

50:24.000 --> 50:27.000
And all your saves transfer through the cloud.

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
It's all through the cloud.

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
So you can pick up your bloody murder right where you left off.

50:31.000 --> 50:35.000
And so a lot of people are asking, well when the hell is the 3DS and the Wii U gonna get on board?

50:35.000 --> 50:39.000
And of course the answer is when Nintendo understands online.

50:39.000 --> 50:45.000
Or it's when they decide, because I have to remind everybody every single week.

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
It's when they decide to, hey guess what?

50:47.000 --> 50:52.000
We're gonna do the 3DS virtual console on the Wii U.

50:52.000 --> 50:55.000
Because it has two screens and the same damn controls.

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
And you can fucking do any 3DS game on there.

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
They're just not doing it yet.

50:59.000 --> 51:02.000
Alright well Nintendo has come out and said quote.

51:02.000 --> 51:10.000
We can confirm that cross-platform functionality is possible in certain titles that play on Nintendo 3DS and Wii U.

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
As well as, I almost said Vita.

51:12.000 --> 51:15.000
As well as other video game systems not made by Nintendo.

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
And the reasoning behind that, just so you know.

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
This is because of pure chess.

51:19.000 --> 51:22.000
Which you can actually play on the Wii U.

51:22.000 --> 51:25.000
But you can also cross-play with Playstation 3 and Vita.

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
Now the reason why this is news.

51:27.000 --> 51:34.000
Is because this is a huge reason why you do not see Final Fantasy XIV on the Xbox 360.

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
Square wanted to put it on the 360.

51:36.000 --> 51:41.000
But Microsoft said, no we will not support the cross-play element.

51:41.000 --> 51:45.000
You will not be able to, Xbox has to be its own server, its own world and everything.

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
Xbox will not cross-play.

51:47.000 --> 51:53.000
Which is funny because Final Fantasy XI was totally not like that and had play online.

51:53.000 --> 51:56.000
But you have to go back a few years.

51:56.000 --> 52:00.000
Microsoft was desperate to have a Final Fantasy game on the 360.

52:00.000 --> 52:03.000
So they broke their own rule in that case only.

52:03.000 --> 52:07.000
And that's why you got 13 later on on the 360 which was controversial.

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
But I digress, back to Nintendo.

52:10.000 --> 52:15.000
We are committed to helping developers realize the full potential of their software on Nintendo systems.

52:15.000 --> 52:18.000
We can confirm that Disney Infinity from Disney Interactive Studios.

52:18.000 --> 52:22.000
Cubeman 2 from 3 Sprockets and Pure Chess from Ripstone.

52:22.000 --> 52:25.000
All have the ability to play on Nintendo systems.

52:25.000 --> 52:29.000
While at the same time communicating with consumers using those same games on other systems.

52:29.000 --> 52:32.000
Additional games using this functionality are in development.

52:32.000 --> 52:33.000
Smash Brothers.

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
I thought that, well not cross system.

52:35.000 --> 52:39.000
I didn't think that the Wii U had an online portion for Disney Infinity.

52:39.000 --> 52:43.000
Because I know they were, I think maybe it was limited to two players only.

52:43.000 --> 52:47.000
But I thought that that was something that was taken out of.

52:47.000 --> 52:50.000
I can't speak first hand because I haven't played Disney Infinity.

52:50.000 --> 52:51.000
Maybe I'm thinking the Wii version.

52:51.000 --> 52:52.000
I'm not aware of that.

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
I think you're thinking of either the regular Wii version.

52:54.000 --> 52:57.000
But I think the Wii U is comparable to the other systems.

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
So I don't think that's, maybe somebody in chat knows.

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
Well it's nice that different consoles play together.

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
I wish it was kind of like that for everything.

53:04.000 --> 53:07.000
Instead of this nonsense that we have going on now.

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
It's a little weird to me that Microsoft won't allow it.

53:09.000 --> 53:14.000
Because what is one of the big features that they're touting on the Xbox One that has nothing to do with video games?

53:14.000 --> 53:15.000
Anybody?

53:15.000 --> 53:16.000
TV, TV, TV, TV.

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
What do you do when you watch TV?

53:18.000 --> 53:19.000
You can.

53:19.000 --> 53:20.000
TV.

53:20.000 --> 53:21.000
What can you do by moving your hand?

53:21.000 --> 53:22.000
You can.

53:22.000 --> 53:23.000
Anyone?

53:23.000 --> 53:24.000
Anyone?

53:24.000 --> 53:25.000
You can Skype.

53:25.000 --> 53:26.000
Flip off the characters.

53:26.000 --> 53:27.000
That's it.

53:27.000 --> 53:28.000
Skype.

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
But isn't Skype cross platform by default?

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
I can Skype on my iPhone.

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
I can Skype on my computer.

53:34.000 --> 53:37.000
So why is Skype okay?

53:37.000 --> 53:38.000
Is it because it's a Microsoft product?

53:38.000 --> 53:39.000
I don't know.

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
Why is Skype okay when all this other stuff isn't?

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
Microsoft bought Skype.

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
It is now.

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
Obviously it didn't start as one for a long time.

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
It's touting Skype.

53:49.000 --> 53:54.000
Oh you can Skype your other Xbox One playing, owning individuals.

53:54.000 --> 53:57.000
Well that's just the same voice and video chat they've already had on their network.

53:57.000 --> 54:00.000
If you go to Skype.com you have that whole Metro look.

54:00.000 --> 54:05.000
And to go on yet another tangent away from what the story was supposed to be about, but

54:05.000 --> 54:10.000
I can't help myself, Skype, very controversial patch coming soon to Skype.

54:10.000 --> 54:17.000
And the 6.1 patch that's due out in December, they are going to block third party apps.

54:17.000 --> 54:22.000
And this is very controversial because many people record their podcasts over Skype using

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
a program like Call Graph.

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
We actually did Hoard House with that for a while.

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
Or Pamela I think one is called.

54:28.000 --> 54:32.000
There's all these different programs people use in Skype to do their podcasts.

54:32.000 --> 54:35.000
They're going to be screwed because Skype is disabling access to this.

54:35.000 --> 54:40.000
Oh I kind of figured you would have meant things like there's a lot of instant messaging

54:40.000 --> 54:45.000
apps that can use Skype for text messaging but not voice and video calls.

54:45.000 --> 54:48.000
Yeah so it's a very controversial thing going into effect.

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
Thank you Xbox One.

54:50.000 --> 54:54.000
It won't affect this show or Hoard House because we don't do it that way.

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
Even though Hoard House is done over Skype, everything.

54:56.000 --> 55:00.000
I have a sound card that supports a native recording of what you hear.

55:00.000 --> 55:04.000
And so if you are a podcaster out there wondering like shit, shit, what am I going to do?

55:04.000 --> 55:05.000
Shit.

55:05.000 --> 55:09.000
I really urge you to look for a Sound Blaster brand card that has a feature in it called

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
What You, the letter you, hear.

55:11.000 --> 55:14.000
And it's made recording for this show so much easier.

55:14.000 --> 55:17.000
And I think if you're willing to drop the 40 bucks on like an external sound card it'll

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
save you a lot of trouble too.

55:19.000 --> 55:20.000
If it's in your budget.

55:20.000 --> 55:23.000
I know it's not in everybody's budget but yeah.

55:23.000 --> 55:26.000
We've been using the same, just to put it in perspective, we've been using the same

55:26.000 --> 55:29.000
sound card for OLR since 2002.

55:29.000 --> 55:33.000
We moved the sound card from computer to computer.

55:33.000 --> 55:34.000
My old laptop had all that too.

55:34.000 --> 55:39.000
That's actually how I used to record BBC Radio 1.

55:39.000 --> 55:40.000
I'd record interviews off of that.

55:40.000 --> 55:41.000
Nice.

55:41.000 --> 55:42.000
Very nice.

55:42.000 --> 55:47.000
So yeah Nintendo cross play.

55:47.000 --> 55:50.000
No, it's a good thing.

55:50.000 --> 55:53.000
And you know who does Nintendo best?

55:53.000 --> 55:54.000
Nintendo.

55:54.000 --> 55:57.000
So I'm looking forward to seeing what they do with this.

55:57.000 --> 56:01.000
And I think Smash Brothers seems like the obvious candidate.

56:01.000 --> 56:04.000
What's going to be that synergy between the 3DS and the Wii U version that we don't know

56:04.000 --> 56:05.000
about yet.

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
There's definitely going to be something there.

56:07.000 --> 56:08.000
What is it?

56:08.000 --> 56:09.000
Don't know yet.

56:09.000 --> 56:10.000
We'll find out.

56:10.000 --> 56:16.000
I still, there's that part of me, tin foil hat mode, going a very similar direction to

56:16.000 --> 56:20.000
what Loki's saying is that, oh well, soon you're going to be able to play 3DS games

56:20.000 --> 56:21.000
on the Wii U.

56:21.000 --> 56:26.000
I kind of think, because we got the 2DS this year, which you know, it's a thing.

56:26.000 --> 56:27.000
It's a new system.

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
Did I tell you I played one of those this week?

56:29.000 --> 56:30.000
I don't think I did.

56:30.000 --> 56:33.000
One of my friends has a 2DS and I played the 2DS this week.

56:33.000 --> 56:34.000
It feels nice.

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
It has a good ergo to it.

56:36.000 --> 56:37.000
Anyway.

56:37.000 --> 56:41.000
Next year we ought to be due for some type of new handheld out of Nintendo, right?

56:41.000 --> 56:45.000
I mean, even though we don't need one per se, that isn't going to stop them from making

56:45.000 --> 56:46.000
one.

56:46.000 --> 56:52.000
What if they make some type of 3DS that can double as, wait for it, a Wii U touchpad?

56:52.000 --> 56:56.000
Because there's all the outcry out there for, how can I buy a second touchpad?

56:56.000 --> 56:57.000
How can I do it?

56:57.000 --> 56:58.000
What if the second touchpad is a 3DS?

56:58.000 --> 57:02.000
We also need something in the portable consoles that supports the Nintendo network.

57:02.000 --> 57:03.000
Why not?

57:03.000 --> 57:04.000
Because the 3DS still does friend codes.

57:04.000 --> 57:05.000
Ooh.

57:05.000 --> 57:08.000
Uh, yes, but at least it's a universal friend code.

57:08.000 --> 57:09.000
True.

57:09.000 --> 57:10.000
Yeah.

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
I mean, the system's a hell of a lot better than the original DS.

57:12.000 --> 57:16.000
It's just the fact that we haven't seen it in a firmware update yet.

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
Obviously we still can in the next year.

57:18.000 --> 57:23.000
But especially for Smash Brothers and what they want to continue to do down the road,

57:23.000 --> 57:27.000
their portable system needs to come in line and start supporting these same things that

57:27.000 --> 57:28.000
the Wii U does.

57:28.000 --> 57:32.000
Code Man in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, Rob, is the screens too small?

57:32.000 --> 57:33.000
It doesn't have to be.

57:33.000 --> 57:37.000
And I'm not saying they're going to make this giant 3DS that's as big as one of those touchpads.

57:37.000 --> 57:38.000
What has to be the same?

57:38.000 --> 57:41.000
The resolution has to be the same, not the size.

57:42.000 --> 57:45.000
So it's very possible that that could happen.

57:45.000 --> 57:48.000
I'm tinfoil-hatting and making shit up, admittedly.

57:48.000 --> 57:49.000
Why not?

57:49.000 --> 57:53.000
It's rumor week on OLR because it's that week in gaming news, so there you go.

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
It's rumor week.

57:55.000 --> 57:56.000
That's right, rumors.

57:56.000 --> 58:00.000
Some other podcasters in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com with some advice for people

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
that are going to get screwed with the Skype changes.

58:02.000 --> 58:07.000
Rama says, use a USB mixer and audition for podcasting.

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
Black Wolf says, I use two sound cards.

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
So there's other ways to do it.

58:11.000 --> 58:14.000
Alrighty, let's move on with some more news.

58:14.000 --> 58:15.000
DarkSakura.

58:15.000 --> 58:22.000
Well, in other news, there is a day one patch for the PS4 that's 300 megabytes and it's

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
adding some interesting things.

58:24.000 --> 58:35.000
It's going to add in the remote play, which means that the titles will be displayed on

58:35.000 --> 58:38.000
the TV and you can use the Vita to connect to them.

58:38.000 --> 58:41.000
The second screen, basically, the Vita.

58:41.000 --> 58:47.000
You can record, take screenshots, upload different videos that you've taken.

58:47.000 --> 58:51.000
You can watch other people play games.

58:51.000 --> 58:52.000
You need Twitch mode.

58:52.000 --> 58:55.000
You can play as you download.

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
You have multiple logins up to four people.

58:57.000 --> 59:01.000
Voice chat, you have facial recognition and voice commands.

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
This is if you have the camera.

59:04.000 --> 59:08.000
Background music player, online multiplayer and the Blu Ray and DVD player.

59:08.000 --> 59:11.000
So they're basically going, oops, all this stuff.

59:11.000 --> 59:12.000
Here you go.

59:12.000 --> 59:18.000
So, I mean, I see no reason to be upset about that, except that, you know, I mean, 300 megabytes

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
isn't really that big.

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
It's just basically saying, oh, we have this functionality.

59:22.000 --> 59:23.000
Now we're unlocking it.

59:23.000 --> 59:24.000
There you go.

59:24.000 --> 59:25.000
Have fun.

59:25.000 --> 59:26.000
Party.

59:26.000 --> 59:27.000
Literally.

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
Because we have party mode.

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
You can talk to your friends and call them assholes.

59:31.000 --> 59:35.000
The only thing I see a problem with it is just the whole Blu Ray DVD playback thing

59:35.000 --> 59:36.000
in there.

59:36.000 --> 59:37.000
That's my only thing.

59:37.000 --> 59:41.000
Because if you don't have any internet and you weren't ever planning on playing on the

59:41.000 --> 59:46.000
internet, all the other features like, you know, streaming video and doing all that stuff,

59:46.000 --> 59:51.000
you probably don't give a shit about because who cares if I can download a title and play

59:51.000 --> 59:52.000
part of the way.

59:52.000 --> 59:55.000
I don't have internet, so it doesn't matter to me.

59:55.000 --> 59:58.000
So that's the only thing that's kind of lame about that.

59:58.000 --> 01:00:04.000
But yeah, a lot of people nowadays have internet, so they could probably download it one way

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:05.000
or another.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:11.000
As long as I think, as long as they support, like, being able to download that off of a

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:14.000
storage device or something like that, so you can go to your friend's house, download

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:18.000
it onto a USB stick and pop it into your PS4 or something like that, like you can right

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:23.000
now with the PlayStation 3, then that might not be so bad if someone doesn't actually

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:26.000
have internet, then they could just go somewhere else and get it.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:31.000
But, you know, if it's like the Xbox 360 or something, you know, usually you can't do that.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
You have to burn a disc or something.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:37.000
There is a part of me, sorry, Jamie, there is a part of me that wonders like, well, those

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:40.000
poor people that are going to buy this system mostly for the Blu-ray playback are going

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:43.000
to get screwed because, you know, they can't connect to the internet.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:46.000
But then I go, well, wait a minute, when those people just get a PlayStation 3 because they're

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:50.000
still on the market and they're going to be cheaper, like these early adopters, I've got

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
to be techie people in the first place, right?

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:53.000
Yeah.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:58.000
I mean, I don't think this news is super bad or, you know, it's, unfortunately, it's not

01:00:58.000 --> 01:00:59.000
out of character at this day and age.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:03.000
And let's, you know, to be fair, at least the update's a lot smaller than the Wii U

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:04.000
one, 300 megs.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:09.000
I mean, fuck, that's half the size of the DLC for, you know, Saints Row IV and you're

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
getting way more replay value out of that.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:14.000
Not to even mention that there are cheaper Blu-ray players on a PS3 nowadays.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
That's very true.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:20.000
It's kind of funny, the direction that we're going soon, Geek Squad is going to start having

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:27.000
console, console, console installation, professional services for, oh, your system doesn't turn

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
on and plug in and press play.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
Now we have to get all this stuff set up upfront.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:32.000
Jason, I'm sure they already do that.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:36.000
Like if you were to ask them those types of questions at Best Buy, like, you know, how

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:40.000
could I switch between my Xbox and my PlayStation or whatever, I'm sure Geek Squad will be happy

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
to come out there and hook it all up for you.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:47.000
I always have to wave off that stupid $3 disc insurance thing whenever I buy a game.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:52.000
Or grandma, you know, I want to set up Netflix on the Wii for my kid and they literally don't

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:56.000
know how to do it because, you know, I could see where there's a small market for that.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:59.000
Yeah, Ranma says they do that now.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:00.000
I had a feeling.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:03.000
But there's a few other things with this.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:08.000
One thing that will not be available at launch is the suspend resume mode that's supposed to

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:12.000
basically use the low power state and take you back into your game, but they said there's

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
more to come on that in the future.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:19.000
There's also a PlayStation app that's going to be out on November 13th in North America

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:22.000
and the 22nd of November in Europe.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:27.000
Can we at least have it where when people are talking, especially companies are talking

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:30.000
about features that they're going to have in their system, that they fucking come out with

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:35.000
the goddamn system and say, yeah, we're going to have this really cool low power mode that's

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:36.000
really awesome.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:37.000
Oh, fuck it.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:38.000
It's not coming out at launch.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:41.000
Oh, hey, we're going to have this Internet browser with this brand new up.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:42.000
No, fuck it.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:43.000
It's not going to be ready.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:49.000
You know, seriously, don't advertise features you're not going to fucking have day one.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:50.000
That's it.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:51.000
I mean, it's just like, hey, I bought this car.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:54.000
I heard all these great things about the wheels it has.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:55.000
Oh, fuck.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:56.000
It doesn't have wheels.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:57.000
Damn.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
No, we can't have that.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:03.000
And we will continue to not have that for the foreseeable decades.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:08.000
I, you know, without evolving on yet another tangent, this is one of those things that

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:13.680
there's very much an argument to, um, the success of valve in the sense that they don't

01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:16.320
tout everything until it's there.

01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:18.680
Valve has not said a word about half-life three.

01:03:18.680 --> 01:03:21.260
We know nothing of what half-life three will be.

01:03:21.260 --> 01:03:25.680
If and when it finally gets here, it's, you know, there's no, there's no expectations

01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:28.680
other than it's gotta be better than the second game and there's a good chance that that's

01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:29.680
going to happen.

01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:31.760
Is valve a publicly traded company?

01:03:31.760 --> 01:03:35.340
That was going to be my second argument is that no valve is valve is not publicly held.

01:03:35.340 --> 01:03:37.160
That's why valve can do what they're doing.

01:03:37.160 --> 01:03:38.160
Yeah.

01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:39.160
That's, that's absolutely true.

01:03:39.160 --> 01:03:43.200
If you don't, if you don't meet your investors' earnings, if you don't, you know, pump up

01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:47.680
your pump, uh, pump your ego in your product for investors, your stock goes down and takes

01:03:47.680 --> 01:03:49.680
everything else of your value with it.

01:03:49.680 --> 01:03:55.040
Um, it's all, it's, it's a really, really tangled web because at the same time, more

01:03:55.040 --> 01:03:59.440
often than not company stocks sync during news announcements, or at least maybe the

01:03:59.440 --> 01:04:04.400
most popular ones like Amazon, Apple, and possibly also Microsoft.

01:04:04.560 --> 01:04:11.120
Um, but that's not an uncommon trend, which seems to say, why do we even bother going

01:04:11.120 --> 01:04:16.400
through this media hype only to have bad news once we get to the end of it?

01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:19.400
All right.

01:04:19.400 --> 01:04:21.400
Well, is that it, Darsana, or do you have more?

01:04:21.400 --> 01:04:26.960
No, I actually had more to say about the app, but, um, yeah, I didn't get it out.

01:04:26.960 --> 01:04:27.960
It's tangenty tonight.

01:04:27.960 --> 01:04:28.960
Yeah, I know.

01:04:28.960 --> 01:04:33.800
Um, the app itself, what it's supposed to do is it lets you access the PlayStation network,

01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:38.160
your friends list, your trophies, but it also has to act as a second screen for games that

01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:39.320
support it.

01:04:39.320 --> 01:04:42.280
So I wanted to get that out.

01:04:42.280 --> 01:04:43.280
Awesome.

01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:44.560
For people who don't know.

01:04:44.560 --> 01:04:48.060
I just hope the servers don't all get hammered the first day and the damn thing takes forever

01:04:48.060 --> 01:04:49.060
to download.

01:04:49.060 --> 01:04:50.060
Like what happened on Wii U.

01:04:50.060 --> 01:04:51.060
Are you being prophetic?

01:04:51.060 --> 01:04:52.640
Well, just saying they will.

01:04:52.640 --> 01:04:53.640
I'm sure they will.

01:04:53.640 --> 01:04:54.640
You just jinxed them, Rob.

01:04:54.640 --> 01:04:55.640
Thank you.

01:04:55.640 --> 01:04:56.640
Thanks, Rob.

01:04:56.640 --> 01:04:59.700
This is no, this is, this is like one of the first rules of the internet is this stuff

01:04:59.700 --> 01:05:00.700
always happens.

01:05:00.700 --> 01:05:01.700
Here you go.

01:05:01.700 --> 01:05:02.700
Here you go.

01:05:02.700 --> 01:05:03.700
Here's here.

01:05:03.700 --> 01:05:06.260
If you catch now on their website, download it to the fucking thumb drive.

01:05:06.260 --> 01:05:07.260
Thank you.

01:05:07.260 --> 01:05:08.260
Thank you.

01:05:08.260 --> 01:05:09.260
That would be a great idea.

01:05:09.260 --> 01:05:10.260
Actually.

01:05:10.260 --> 01:05:13.220
It's like, Hey, we know our servers are probably gonna get hammered at launch.

01:05:13.220 --> 01:05:17.860
Hey, you want to take, you want to be a little bit, a bit torrent, put a bit torrent out

01:05:17.860 --> 01:05:18.860
there.

01:05:18.860 --> 01:05:25.020
Then they, then it won't even be on their servers, but I guess that's, yeah, I'm just

01:05:25.020 --> 01:05:32.220
saying, I'm just, you, you could, that's a little too controversial for them, but then

01:05:32.220 --> 01:05:36.180
hackers would tear that shit apart if they're going to tear it apart anyways, what are they

01:05:36.180 --> 01:05:37.180
going to do with it?

01:05:37.180 --> 01:05:41.180
It's just going to take them five minutes longer, figure out that much faster, how to

01:05:41.180 --> 01:05:42.700
install Linux on it.

01:05:42.700 --> 01:05:49.500
I guess they've already done it to the toaster, so don't get me started to register participation

01:05:49.500 --> 01:05:52.580
for this week's episode of orange launch radio at vog network.com.

01:05:52.580 --> 01:05:58.780
Use the passphrase saw, um, okay.

01:05:58.780 --> 01:06:02.660
So a little bit more about the PlayStation for, um, there was some details coming out

01:06:02.660 --> 01:06:07.580
about the digital games and some of the benefits you get with PlayStation plus, for example,

01:06:07.580 --> 01:06:12.740
digital games, you can actually share your account with a couple, two consoles.

01:06:12.740 --> 01:06:16.820
So you have one console that you deem your primary console that kind of operates the

01:06:16.820 --> 01:06:21.620
way I see is similar to like, um, I think how your PlayStation three works right now,

01:06:21.620 --> 01:06:26.760
where you download stuff to it and it will play with, you know, pretty much anybody that's

01:06:26.760 --> 01:06:30.800
logged in will have access to that DLC or the game or whatever.

01:06:30.800 --> 01:06:37.040
Um, also, um, remote play will be available through the Vita and you'll be able to, I

01:06:37.040 --> 01:06:41.240
guess, purchase and preorder content via the PlayStation app for that console and that

01:06:41.240 --> 01:06:42.240
type of stuff.

01:06:42.240 --> 01:06:46.240
You can also, um, use two systems concurrently.

01:06:46.240 --> 01:06:52.360
So the system activated is your primary PS4 and one other system that you're logged into.

01:06:52.360 --> 01:06:59.200
So that to me sounds like if I get grand theft out of five for the PlayStation four

01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:06.440
or something like that or whatever, and I have the digital download for like, you know,

01:07:06.440 --> 01:07:11.680
I downloaded to my system and then I have a second PS4, my friend has a PS4 and I log

01:07:11.680 --> 01:07:18.080
into their system that I can play two players with the same game or is they only gonna allow

01:07:18.080 --> 01:07:19.480
one person to play at a time?

01:07:19.480 --> 01:07:20.480
It doesn't really specify.

01:07:20.480 --> 01:07:25.400
I think it's very, that what the Xbox 360 does right now is almost the exact same rules,

01:07:25.400 --> 01:07:28.320
sort of locally, not across systems.

01:07:28.320 --> 01:07:31.280
If everybody's in the same household, you can have those, those guests accounts, which

01:07:31.280 --> 01:07:34.580
are the same gamer tag with the one, two, three appended to it.

01:07:34.580 --> 01:07:37.680
I think that's what you're thinking of, but certainly not across two consoles in different

01:07:37.680 --> 01:07:38.680
locations.

01:07:38.680 --> 01:07:42.040
No, it sounds like, well, I mean, it sounds similar to what I think.

01:07:42.040 --> 01:07:44.880
Didn't you guys have to do something like that with Mass Effect or something where you'd

01:07:44.880 --> 01:07:49.600
play on one console and log in, you know, with the other person's thing.

01:07:49.600 --> 01:07:51.000
I don't know.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:56.720
They've kind of done this right now, I wanna say with, cause remember they used to have

01:07:56.720 --> 01:08:02.640
it where you could authorize like a few accounts and the whole thing, or a few different systems

01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:09.640
to use your data, your DLC or whatever with, just because, you know, oh well, what if,

01:08:09.640 --> 01:08:12.860
you know, my system crashes and I need a new system and I need to authorize it so they

01:08:12.860 --> 01:08:13.860
have the file.

01:08:13.860 --> 01:08:20.860
And you would have actually, um, people exploiting that to, okay, I buy a copy of a game and

01:08:20.860 --> 01:08:22.740
I'm gonna share it with four of my friends.

01:08:22.740 --> 01:08:28.140
So they started limiting that down to, I think now it's down to two and I think that's what

01:08:28.140 --> 01:08:29.140
they have here.

01:08:29.140 --> 01:08:32.180
So you could exploit that, but I don't think it's meant for that.

01:08:32.180 --> 01:08:35.140
It's more of like, you know, I'm going to my friend's house or something.

01:08:35.140 --> 01:08:36.140
Yeah.

01:08:36.140 --> 01:08:38.280
It's more like you are going to go to your friends and play one game, but your little

01:08:38.280 --> 01:08:40.860
brother is still at home playing your PlayStation four.

01:08:40.860 --> 01:08:43.140
Like it's more like that kind of situation, right?

01:08:43.140 --> 01:08:44.140
I think so.

01:08:44.140 --> 01:08:45.140
Two is pretty reasonable.

01:08:45.140 --> 01:08:46.140
Yeah.

01:08:46.140 --> 01:08:48.140
I think that's how it's supposed to be.

01:08:48.140 --> 01:08:49.660
Uh, oh, here we go.

01:08:49.660 --> 01:08:58.040
It says, uh, let's see, cause they have like an infographic for it and it says only, only

01:08:58.040 --> 01:09:00.300
you can start games you download.

01:09:00.300 --> 01:09:05.740
Only you can enjoy benefits from PlayStation plus and then, uh, systems that are not activated

01:09:05.740 --> 01:09:06.860
as your primary.

01:09:06.860 --> 01:09:10.620
And then, uh, that graphic is clear as bud.

01:09:10.620 --> 01:09:11.620
Yeah.

01:09:11.820 --> 01:09:14.140
I don't understand what the fuck they're talking about.

01:09:14.140 --> 01:09:16.660
A system that is activated is primary.

01:09:16.660 --> 01:09:19.980
Uh, yeah, you, you have, don't get it.

01:09:19.980 --> 01:09:22.180
I think that's, yeah, I think I had it right.

01:09:22.180 --> 01:09:23.180
You had it right.

01:09:23.180 --> 01:09:27.260
You can, you with your account, with your PlayStation network account can download things

01:09:27.260 --> 01:09:28.400
to the console.

01:09:28.400 --> 01:09:32.900
As soon as it's on the console, anybody else can take advantage of that locally.

01:09:32.900 --> 01:09:36.100
Nobody else can start a download using your account.

01:09:36.100 --> 01:09:38.300
It's it's, it's pretty expected.

01:09:38.300 --> 01:09:44.660
Uh, some other random details that were, um, released, I guess that the PlayStation four

01:09:44.660 --> 01:09:48.380
and Xbox one both support up to eight people in party chat.

01:09:48.380 --> 01:09:49.380
Now here's my questions.

01:09:49.380 --> 01:09:52.140
How many does the Xbox three 60 support now in party chat?

01:09:52.140 --> 01:09:54.100
Because I think it's quite a few people.

01:09:54.100 --> 01:09:55.100
I think eight.

01:09:55.100 --> 01:09:56.100
You think six?

01:09:56.100 --> 01:09:57.100
I thought it was only six.

01:09:57.100 --> 01:10:02.320
I seem to remember it's a full game limited to four plus just two more could be wrong.

01:10:02.320 --> 01:10:06.940
It's been forever since I've used that because I don't know, because I know I've had a lot

01:10:06.940 --> 01:10:10.640
of people in party chat before, but I don't remember.

01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:11.640
I haven't really counted.

01:10:11.640 --> 01:10:14.640
There's no, it worked.

01:10:14.640 --> 01:10:16.860
So it'd be interesting.

01:10:16.860 --> 01:10:19.060
Hopefully it's the same or more, you know?

01:10:19.060 --> 01:10:20.060
Um, yeah.

01:10:20.060 --> 01:10:24.680
And he said, party voice chat will support eight players like on places where like from

01:10:24.680 --> 01:10:28.620
support that xbox.com a party can contain up to eight people.

01:10:28.620 --> 01:10:31.940
Once the maximum attendance is reached, someone must leave the party before another person

01:10:31.940 --> 01:10:34.160
can join.

01:10:34.160 --> 01:10:36.500
That's the GTFO our party right now.

01:10:36.500 --> 01:10:39.380
We want someone cool.

01:10:39.380 --> 01:10:40.540
Get out.

01:10:40.540 --> 01:10:41.860
We have no cake for you.

01:10:41.860 --> 01:10:47.020
I was gonna say like eight seems right because like, isn't like a Forza horizon match, like

01:10:47.020 --> 01:10:51.140
eight people and like a lot of xbox live stuff is like eight people I think.

01:10:51.140 --> 01:10:52.140
So anyway.

01:10:52.140 --> 01:10:54.100
All right.

01:10:54.100 --> 01:10:55.100
That's it.

01:10:55.100 --> 01:10:56.100
All right.

01:10:56.100 --> 01:11:01.860
Well, moving on to some more news, uh, news about a game called bravely default for the

01:11:01.860 --> 01:11:02.860
sequel.

01:11:02.860 --> 01:11:08.820
Uh, bravely default for the sequel is going to be coming out on the three D S and uh,

01:11:08.820 --> 01:11:13.820
it's going to have a new system in it known as bravely second, uh, bravely default for

01:11:13.820 --> 01:11:18.300
the sequel is kind of like a cutesy little like role playing ish type of game.

01:11:18.300 --> 01:11:23.500
Um, bravely second will, uh, have, you know, time stopping antics, which, you know, we're

01:11:23.500 --> 01:11:28.660
in the original game, uh, but it relies on what's called SP your special power.

01:11:28.660 --> 01:11:31.940
Uh, once you use this power, your SP decreases.

01:11:31.940 --> 01:11:36.780
You can gain SP when you put your three D S and sleep mode, but it's a little bit slow.

01:11:36.780 --> 01:11:38.420
It's like regening Nana and ever quest.

01:11:38.420 --> 01:11:39.780
It's very, very slow.

01:11:39.780 --> 01:11:43.580
One SP point is added for every eight hours of idle time.

01:11:43.580 --> 01:11:44.580
But guess what?

01:11:44.580 --> 01:11:50.640
If you don't want to wait, you can buy potions on the three D S E shop that refill your SP.

01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:53.940
I've seen that model before on a Facebook game.

01:11:53.940 --> 01:11:54.940
Yuck.

01:11:54.940 --> 01:12:01.300
Well, we keep telling them they need to learn the internet, so we're better to turn to not

01:12:01.300 --> 01:12:02.300
the place to do.

01:12:02.300 --> 01:12:04.980
I don't think this is actually a Nintendo game.

01:12:04.980 --> 01:12:12.020
However, um, we don't know, uh, producer Tomoya as Sano, uh, assures fans that this will be

01:12:12.020 --> 01:12:13.020
a good thing.

01:12:13.020 --> 01:12:14.020
Oh, of course.

01:12:14.020 --> 01:12:19.060
Quote, bravely second, isn't a demerit, but a system that gives players an advantage.

01:12:19.060 --> 01:12:21.340
It's convenient and it's very powerful.

01:12:21.340 --> 01:12:24.480
So in other words, it's for people that want to cheat, I guess is what I'm reading in that.

01:12:24.520 --> 01:12:27.960
And so if you want to like, you can buy cheats essentially.

01:12:27.960 --> 01:12:30.400
This game is out in Japan in December.

01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:33.840
Um, I don't know if it's coming out here.

01:12:33.840 --> 01:12:38.280
I haven't heard anything about it.

01:12:38.280 --> 01:12:42.920
I'm trying to see bravely default Western release includes updated for the sequel.

01:12:42.920 --> 01:12:46.320
We had the, we had the first one.

01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:48.520
So bravery default.

01:12:48.520 --> 01:12:52.160
I'm switching my internal clock to make it look like it's a day later.

01:12:52.160 --> 01:12:53.840
Oh, look, there's all my energy back.

01:12:53.840 --> 01:12:54.840
Yeah.

01:12:54.840 --> 01:12:58.040
I wonder if people would be able to time travel and trick the trick, the thing that way.

01:12:58.040 --> 01:13:01.280
Another article on the site says that it's going to be out in North America in 2014.

01:13:01.280 --> 01:13:04.760
Oh, thank you.

01:13:04.760 --> 01:13:05.760
I didn't play the first one.

01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:09.040
I gotta be honest, but I did hear about it and you know, some people seem to enjoy it.

01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:16.700
So I really hope that this is something that truly, not just cause the dude says it is

01:13:16.700 --> 01:13:20.200
truly is not like has no impact on the game.

01:13:20.200 --> 01:13:24.340
If I were to not use it, like in other words, I could still beat the game start to finish

01:13:24.340 --> 01:13:27.520
without too much hassle without even touching this stuff.

01:13:27.520 --> 01:13:30.000
Cause that would just be, that would just be shitty.

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:31.620
I don't really have another word for it.

01:13:31.620 --> 01:13:36.820
One point for every eight hours though, on any scale of any RPG I've ever played, that's,

01:13:36.820 --> 01:13:38.800
that's ludicrously small.

01:13:38.800 --> 01:13:42.220
And like you would, you know, let, let's assume something's 15 points.

01:13:42.220 --> 01:13:44.920
That's what, four days of idle before you recharge that.

01:13:44.920 --> 01:13:45.920
It's ridiculous.

01:13:45.920 --> 01:13:50.180
Shane's telling me we haven't had the first one, but I'm looking at it right here on Amazon

01:13:50.180 --> 01:13:54.120
for sale or is this an import Japanese?

01:13:54.120 --> 01:13:57.440
I got fooled has a really pretty art.

01:13:57.440 --> 01:14:02.360
So you know, somebody that imported it and I guess so as if there's not plenty of people

01:14:02.360 --> 01:14:07.400
around this table, that's ever done something like that for a game before 2d X.

01:14:07.400 --> 01:14:08.400
All right.

01:14:08.400 --> 01:14:10.200
Uh, let's move on before we get to release date.

01:14:10.200 --> 01:14:11.200
Start Sakura.

01:14:11.200 --> 01:14:15.280
Um, we have, uh, remember last week we talked about, was it last week?

01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:19.000
I think that, um, Nintendo wasn't going to be making Wii for Japan anymore.

01:14:19.780 --> 01:14:20.780
This is Wii, not the Wii U.

01:14:20.780 --> 01:14:24.100
Well, it's already been confirmed as well for Europe.

01:14:24.100 --> 01:14:29.980
Um, they are going to be producing no more for the European markets and, um, Nintendo

01:14:29.980 --> 01:14:36.220
of UK said that the consumers who don't own a Wii can still buy a Wii mini.

01:14:36.220 --> 01:14:39.540
That's the lower price point that has a bunch of the stuff missing.

01:14:39.540 --> 01:14:48.980
Um, it's all using a DLC, sorry, it's only disc based games and no deals, uh, no download

01:14:48.980 --> 01:14:51.760
titles and no backwards compatibility.

01:14:51.760 --> 01:14:55.480
Um, but, uh, no word for the U S yet.

01:14:55.480 --> 01:14:57.200
There was a second body type for the Wii.

01:14:57.200 --> 01:14:59.160
Yeah, it was the Wii mini.

01:14:59.160 --> 01:15:00.160
It was crap.

01:15:00.160 --> 01:15:04.960
It, there is no internet connection cause it doesn't have a wifi, anything in it.

01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:07.480
There was no HD out on it.

01:15:07.480 --> 01:15:12.360
Um, and it's funny cause it has all these channels and stuff on there, but you can't

01:15:12.360 --> 01:15:14.600
really do anything with it because there's no internet.

01:15:14.600 --> 01:15:15.600
You can't download the virtual console stuff.

01:15:15.600 --> 01:15:18.320
Yeah, they shut off all the, a lot of the channels now.

01:15:18.320 --> 01:15:19.320
Yeah.

01:15:19.320 --> 01:15:20.320
Did that actually come out stateside?

01:15:20.320 --> 01:15:22.320
No GameCube backwards compatibility in Canada.

01:15:22.320 --> 01:15:23.900
I don't know if the mini ever did, Canada.

01:15:23.900 --> 01:15:27.420
Canada got the red one, of course, but, uh, I don't think it ever came out in the U S.

01:15:27.420 --> 01:15:29.100
I missed all of this news.

01:15:29.100 --> 01:15:30.100
It's just crap.

01:15:30.100 --> 01:15:34.460
Just, I mean, seriously, if you're going to save money on a Wii, buy a used Wii.

01:15:34.460 --> 01:15:39.020
It's you know, why bother wasting money on a brand new piece of shit that doesn't do

01:15:39.020 --> 01:15:40.020
anything?

01:15:40.020 --> 01:15:41.460
I don't know.

01:15:41.460 --> 01:15:45.580
The Wii does have a huge game library though for people that, you know, might want to get

01:15:45.580 --> 01:15:47.300
one for a younger person.

01:15:47.300 --> 01:15:50.360
You know, entry level gaming console or whatever.

01:15:50.360 --> 01:15:54.320
And really the Wii was only a good for me for one thing and that was, you know, weather

01:15:54.320 --> 01:16:00.400
and we news and I can't do that anymore because the news channel doesn't work.

01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:04.280
I checked that every, no it's funny that you mentioned that because I kind of liked those

01:16:04.280 --> 01:16:06.120
channels for a very long time.

01:16:06.120 --> 01:16:10.480
There's always something wrong with the news channel and uh, yeah, I don't know.

01:16:10.480 --> 01:16:13.760
I found easier source, Oh no, I know what happened.

01:16:13.760 --> 01:16:19.740
I found an iPhone and then having to go back to a console on my TV was not exactly as important

01:16:19.740 --> 01:16:20.740
or convenient anymore.

01:16:20.740 --> 01:16:24.900
I just can't believe that I waited in line for that, except that I hung out with Kristen

01:16:24.900 --> 01:16:27.100
the whole time and it was pretty fun and we got donuts.

01:16:27.100 --> 01:16:32.460
It was alright in the beginning, I don't know, Excite Truck was awesome.

01:16:32.460 --> 01:16:35.020
You're still mad about Excite Bots.

01:16:35.020 --> 01:16:37.980
I am furious about Excite Bots.

01:16:37.980 --> 01:16:43.260
Seriously, who in the, who on the face of the earth thought, hey let's put a mini game

01:16:43.260 --> 01:16:46.080
in the middle of a fucking race and that's a great idea.

01:16:46.080 --> 01:16:48.360
I don't want to punch them in the goddamn face.

01:16:48.360 --> 01:16:52.020
Like for some reason it's become like a trend on Twitter lately to really hate on the Twilight

01:16:52.020 --> 01:16:56.760
Princess as part of the Zelda series, but I mean that game was like the shit when it

01:16:56.760 --> 01:16:58.960
first came out on the Nintendo Wii.

01:16:58.960 --> 01:17:04.580
I mean just kind of what it, what it did and then I named my cat after and kind of like,

01:17:04.580 --> 01:17:07.360
you know what that brought to the table for gaming in general.

01:17:07.360 --> 01:17:12.020
Um, so I guess, you know, now if you go back and play it now, it's a little bit like, Oh,

01:17:12.020 --> 01:17:16.040
this is very linear, but I mean it was great at the time.

01:17:16.040 --> 01:17:18.600
Yeah, the Wii, the Wii brought a lot of great games.

01:17:18.600 --> 01:17:19.600
Come on.

01:17:19.600 --> 01:17:20.600
All right, let's move on.

01:17:20.600 --> 01:17:24.040
We've got to travel around the world and check out some release dates and what's coming out

01:17:24.040 --> 01:17:25.960
near you soon.

01:17:25.960 --> 01:17:27.500
Yes.

01:17:27.500 --> 01:17:32.140
So this week, uh, actually a lot of games, but in no particular order here, Monster High

01:17:32.140 --> 01:17:38.600
13 Wishes for girls on the Wii, Wii U, 3DS and DS.

01:17:39.400 --> 01:17:45.620
They're also doing some collections of games, X-Com and Civ 5, the 2K definitive strategy

01:17:45.620 --> 01:17:53.140
collection on PC, Sonic Lost World on 3DS and Wii U, Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures,

01:17:53.140 --> 01:17:59.240
the game that sort of resembles some of the 3D Sonic games and based on some new animated

01:17:59.240 --> 01:18:07.220
TV series, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii and Wii U and 3DS I believe.

01:18:07.220 --> 01:18:12.340
The game stick is finally coming out and no one cared.

01:18:12.340 --> 01:18:18.280
The 2K power pack collection with Darkness 2, I think it, actually that might be the

01:18:18.280 --> 01:18:28.020
first Darkness, the Darkness Mafia 2 and Bioshock, I have to make sure here, I can't read this.

01:18:28.020 --> 01:18:36.140
Oh, Bioshock 2 Darkness 2 and Mafia 2, those are coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

01:18:36.140 --> 01:18:43.540
Battlefield 4 on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and PC this week.

01:18:43.540 --> 01:18:51.580
Angry Birds Star Wars on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, Wii U, 3DS and Vita.

01:18:51.580 --> 01:18:58.540
Beyblade Evolution on 3DS, Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360,

01:18:58.540 --> 01:19:05.900
Wii U and actually no PC, that's coming out later because we can't get their release dates

01:19:05.900 --> 01:19:08.220
coordinated for the PC versions.

01:19:08.220 --> 01:19:13.940
WWE 2K14 on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

01:19:13.940 --> 01:19:19.660
What else here?

01:19:19.660 --> 01:19:25.540
Transformers Ultimate Battle Edition re-release there, also Ultimate Autobots Edition and

01:19:25.540 --> 01:19:35.380
there's one last one here, more Angry Birds, Doodle Jump for 3DS.

01:19:35.900 --> 01:19:41.340
Yeah, 3DS and DS, Doodle Jump.

01:19:41.340 --> 01:19:51.620
And then, oh, also I think on Friday, I think that's the first, Wii Remote, they're gonna

01:19:51.620 --> 01:19:58.540
have a Wii Remote Plus for Luigi and Mario, you know, cause that's cool and all.

01:19:58.540 --> 01:20:05.000
I wanted to add, this is kind of funny, cause I don't know if they even talk next gen release

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:12.000
dates yet, but Call of Duty Ghosts on all formats will be coming out on the 5th.

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:17.320
That's right, you can get Call of Duty Ghosts two weeks before the system that comes out

01:20:17.320 --> 01:20:20.040
to play it on the Xbox One.

01:20:20.040 --> 01:20:21.240
Doesn't this happen all the time?

01:20:21.240 --> 01:20:25.960
No, it happens a few days, like, you know, it comes out on Friday and it releases on...

01:20:25.960 --> 01:20:28.720
So when the Wii U came out, all the games were on shelves earlier, I remember that.

01:20:28.720 --> 01:20:34.120
Yeah, they were out like, you know, maybe a few days before the system came out, maybe

01:20:34.120 --> 01:20:35.400
a week.

01:20:35.400 --> 01:20:38.200
But this is like two weeks, this is fucking stupid.

01:20:38.200 --> 01:20:39.200
I gotcha.

01:20:39.200 --> 01:20:42.520
Alright, let's take a look at Japan and what's coming out in Japan.

01:20:42.520 --> 01:20:45.760
They're getting their releases on Halloween the 31st.

01:20:45.760 --> 01:20:50.560
The FPS Pad 3 Strike Gear, I think that's actually an accessory, sorry that's not a

01:20:50.560 --> 01:20:51.560
game.

01:20:51.560 --> 01:20:56.040
But you can get a Mahjong game called Dankyu Battle 3, comes out this week on the Playstation

01:20:56.040 --> 01:20:57.040
3.

01:20:57.040 --> 01:21:02.520
Next to Tiara 2, Hau no Matsue comes out in a first print limited edition, if you're

01:21:02.520 --> 01:21:03.620
so inclined.

01:21:03.620 --> 01:21:08.400
And then Vampire Resurrection, just in time for Halloween, gets a price reduction.

01:21:08.400 --> 01:21:10.040
So there you go on the Playstation 3.

01:21:10.040 --> 01:21:13.040
On the Xbox 360, there is really nothing this week.

01:21:13.040 --> 01:21:19.640
You can get that same little FPS Pad thing I talked about before, that's really it.

01:21:19.640 --> 01:21:23.120
On the Playstation Vita this week, Gundam Breaker!

01:21:23.160 --> 01:21:27.640
And there is also a new Slim model, because I believe those Vita Slims, those just came

01:21:27.640 --> 01:21:31.520
out in Japan like a couple weeks ago, or one of them, right?

01:21:31.520 --> 01:21:35.380
There's a Gundam Breaker Vita pack, if you're so inclined, so that's out.

01:21:35.380 --> 01:21:42.720
Also Chuu Jiji-Gen GEMU Neptune Rebirth 1, in regular and limited edition, is out on

01:21:42.720 --> 01:21:44.960
the Vita as well.

01:21:44.960 --> 01:21:50.360
On the Wii U this week, yes there is some Wii U stuff in Japan this week, Wii Party

01:21:50.360 --> 01:21:52.960
U is one of the big games coming out.

01:21:52.960 --> 01:22:00.280
And then there's some stuff that's centered around, it looks like Wii Fit U, but is that

01:22:00.280 --> 01:22:02.080
available for download on the 31st?

01:22:02.080 --> 01:22:04.680
I don't remember how that whole thing was going down, like remember you could like download

01:22:04.680 --> 01:22:05.680
it a month early or something?

01:22:05.680 --> 01:22:09.520
Yeah, you're supposed to be able to download it a month early, and I know that next, not

01:22:09.520 --> 01:22:16.000
next week, but the week after next, those stupid Wii Fit sensor things are supposed

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:17.000
to go on sale.

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:21.200
Because in Japan, you've got the Fit Meter is out this week, and the Balance Board covers

01:22:21.200 --> 01:22:26.640
are out this week, so I'm like, there's a lot of activity around Wii Fit coming out

01:22:26.640 --> 01:22:27.640
this week.

01:22:27.640 --> 01:22:32.200
In fact, it looks like there's actually a Wii U set that comes with Wii Fit U that they're

01:22:32.200 --> 01:22:33.200
releasing in Japan.

01:22:33.200 --> 01:22:34.200
I'm trying to bring this up right now.

01:22:34.200 --> 01:22:39.380
Oh yeah, looks like there's a new bundle in Japan that's 32 gigs, black Wii U, with Mario

01:22:39.380 --> 01:22:45.920
Brothers U, Wii Party U, Wii Fit U, a Wii Mote, and the whole little like sensor bar

01:22:45.920 --> 01:22:52.400
thing, and it comes with one of the little portable, what are those called, the sensors?

01:22:52.400 --> 01:22:57.220
They look like Tamagotchis, for God's sake, they're little Wii U Tamagotchis, but it's

01:22:57.220 --> 01:22:58.220
you.

01:22:58.220 --> 01:23:00.440
That's straight up the pocket station right there.

01:23:00.440 --> 01:23:01.440
Right?

01:23:01.440 --> 01:23:04.680
So they've got a hefty little bundle there in Japan out this week.

01:23:04.680 --> 01:23:14.800
So alright, let's see, also moving on to the Nintendo 3DS, Dan Ball Senki Wars is out this

01:23:14.800 --> 01:23:23.000
week, and Chara Petsukute Sonatete, character Shogaku, comes out this week.

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:28.960
And that's just cute little animals including a pink panda who has hearts for ears.

01:23:28.960 --> 01:23:31.160
Aw, that's adorable.

01:23:31.160 --> 01:23:32.160
That's it for Japanese releases.

01:23:32.160 --> 01:23:33.920
How about the UK darts, Sakura?

01:23:33.920 --> 01:23:42.080
In the UK, we have on the 29th of October, WWE K14, on the 31st, Football Manager 2014

01:23:42.080 --> 01:23:49.080
for PC and Mac, and Tokitori, excuse me, on November 1st, there's Angry Birds Star

01:23:49.080 --> 01:23:54.160
Wars for damn near everything, and Angry Birds Star Wars 2 for damn near every console, Assassin's

01:23:54.160 --> 01:24:04.000
Creed 4 Black Flag, Battlefield 4, Blur Overdrive for iPad and iPhone, and Wii Fit U.

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:07.160
That sounds kind of dirty.

01:24:07.160 --> 01:24:09.000
I don't want to know about that anymore.

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:10.000
I'm done.

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:14.000
Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys, and then the classic game of the week,

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:15.400
but first, Loki.

01:24:15.400 --> 01:24:22.480
Alright, so there's going to be a brand new Mario themed, I guess, deluxe bundle that's

01:24:22.480 --> 01:24:24.400
going to be coming out for the Wii U.

01:24:24.400 --> 01:24:28.840
Instead of Nintendo landing in there, they're kind of updating the whole skew with now New

01:24:28.840 --> 01:24:34.560
Super Mario Brothers U and the DLC New Luigi, or New Super Luigi U, so you'll be able to

01:24:34.560 --> 01:24:43.600
get that for $2.99 this holiday, starting, I believe, at the end of next week, so it'll

01:24:43.600 --> 01:24:44.600
be pretty fast.

01:24:44.600 --> 01:24:52.920
And then also, even though it is leaving shelves in a couple other regions, the Wii will still

01:24:52.920 --> 01:25:00.720
be around in the US, and basically the announcement of the Wii console being discontinued is specific

01:25:00.720 --> 01:25:03.320
to Japan, and well, now Europe.

01:25:03.320 --> 01:25:07.300
There's no change of status in the Wii in the United States, and is available for purchase

01:25:07.300 --> 01:25:08.920
this holiday season.

01:25:08.920 --> 01:25:14.840
Of course, you know, gotta clear out those shelves, because they probably still stock

01:25:14.840 --> 01:25:15.840
over here.

01:25:15.840 --> 01:25:17.840
Yeah, that's right.

01:25:17.840 --> 01:25:23.680
Alright, in some other bundle related news, this is something that's happening in Japan,

01:25:23.680 --> 01:25:28.800
but Metal Gear Rising will be getting like a Playstation 3 special edition.

01:25:29.600 --> 01:25:34.280
It's a DLC bundled Playstation 3 re-release that's going to come out later this year for

01:25:34.280 --> 01:25:38.560
Metal Gear Rising, and it's the Re-Vengeance special edition.

01:25:38.560 --> 01:25:45.340
It will have Blade Wolf and Jetstream DLC packs, 30 VR missions, 5 alternate costumes,

01:25:45.340 --> 01:25:48.480
and a custom Playstation 3 theme.

01:25:48.480 --> 01:25:53.680
You can check all that out on December 5th, and it's also going to be available as a download

01:25:53.680 --> 01:25:57.220
on Playstation Network, as most of the game releases are.

01:25:57.220 --> 01:25:59.280
Don't know yet if this is coming out stateside.

01:25:59.280 --> 01:26:02.240
This is only confirmed for Japan as of right now.

01:26:02.240 --> 01:26:04.260
Speaking of Playstation, I have another quick story.

01:26:04.260 --> 01:26:09.460
This is about a whole little Playstation bundle.

01:26:09.460 --> 01:26:10.460
This is interesting.

01:26:10.460 --> 01:26:15.900
A Gran Turismo 6 bundle that's going to come out in Brazil.

01:26:15.900 --> 01:26:20.340
It's an, I'm going to mispronounce this name, and I apologize because he passed away in

01:26:20.340 --> 01:26:23.460
1994, but he was a very famous racer.

01:26:23.460 --> 01:26:28.380
Ayrton Senna, I hope I didn't mispronounce that, I apologize if I did, but he's going

01:26:28.380 --> 01:26:33.700
to be featured as part of this Gran Turismo 6 bundle that's coming out, and it's supposed

01:26:33.700 --> 01:26:36.900
to actually kind of like help charity, which is pretty cool.

01:26:36.900 --> 01:26:41.900
I'm assuming that part of the proceeds of the bundle actually go to the institute set

01:26:41.900 --> 01:26:45.980
up in this guy's name that helps to educate, so that's pretty cool.

01:26:45.980 --> 01:26:46.980
This is on December 6th.

01:26:46.980 --> 01:26:48.940
This is coming out in Brazil.

01:26:48.940 --> 01:26:55.180
Comes out with Gran Turismo 6, a 250 gigabyte Playstation 3, and one controller.

01:26:55.180 --> 01:26:58.340
So that's very cool.

01:26:58.340 --> 01:27:01.180
One other reason I bring this up is that, I don't know if you guys saw, but apparently

01:27:01.180 --> 01:27:04.340
the Playstation 4 is going to cost oodles and oodles of money in Brazil.

01:27:04.340 --> 01:27:05.980
Did you hear about that?

01:27:05.980 --> 01:27:06.980
It's something like...

01:27:06.980 --> 01:27:08.220
It kind of doesn't surprise me though.

01:27:08.220 --> 01:27:09.700
Yeah, everything costs more over there.

01:27:09.700 --> 01:27:14.940
Yeah, I know, but it's like on the scale of like $1500 or something like that when you

01:27:14.940 --> 01:27:16.500
convert the money.

01:27:16.500 --> 01:27:22.660
It's a really high price, so I bet there will be people that just somehow get one from the

01:27:22.660 --> 01:27:25.780
US or another place and import them for way less.

01:27:25.780 --> 01:27:28.540
But it's taxes is what the thing is.

01:27:28.540 --> 01:27:31.500
Taxes that really affect the prices, not that they're marketing it up.

01:27:31.500 --> 01:27:33.500
People will get them illegally.

01:27:33.500 --> 01:27:39.900
Alright, let's travel back to a time when Gran Turismo 5 wasn't even out.

01:27:39.900 --> 01:27:42.580
Heck, I don't even think the original Gran Turismo was out.

01:27:42.940 --> 01:27:46.780
In fact, some people would still agree that Gran Turismo 5 is not out yet.

01:27:46.780 --> 01:27:48.660
That's the joke I was trying to make unsuccessfully.

01:27:48.660 --> 01:27:52.820
But it's time for Dark Sakura to step into the gaming vault and find a game that she

01:27:52.820 --> 01:27:57.300
thinks, hey, you should like play this now and stuff.

01:27:57.300 --> 01:27:58.420
You're going to roll your eyes.

01:27:58.420 --> 01:28:00.780
I'm totally going to roll my eyes at this week's...

01:28:00.780 --> 01:28:04.220
But I did it for you and I did it for Shane.

01:28:04.220 --> 01:28:05.220
Don't do anything for Shane.

01:28:05.220 --> 01:28:06.220
That was the first mistake.

01:28:06.220 --> 01:28:08.740
I am doing something for Shane so that he will help me level.

01:28:08.740 --> 01:28:10.140
You're only making him stronger.

01:28:10.140 --> 01:28:11.140
That's right.

01:28:11.140 --> 01:28:13.060
Shane is horrible power stronger.

01:28:13.060 --> 01:28:14.940
Shane, don't listen to them.

01:28:14.940 --> 01:28:16.940
You have good taste in music.

01:28:16.940 --> 01:28:20.500
Alright, Dark Sakura, what is the classic game of the week?

01:28:20.500 --> 01:28:23.700
It's Pokemon Red and Blue.

01:28:23.700 --> 01:28:24.700
Don't laugh.

01:28:24.700 --> 01:28:25.700
These aren't classic.

01:28:25.700 --> 01:28:26.700
Don't judge me.

01:28:26.700 --> 01:28:29.340
You're totally judging me right now.

01:28:29.340 --> 01:28:31.460
Maybe a little bit.

01:28:31.460 --> 01:28:40.440
Anyway, so anyway, this was developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo for the Game

01:28:40.440 --> 01:28:44.960
Boy and this came out in 1996.

01:28:44.960 --> 01:28:50.680
Actually in Japan they came out as Red and Green and Blue was released as a special edition.

01:28:50.680 --> 01:28:54.400
Then they were released as Red and Blue in North America, Europe and Australia over the

01:28:54.400 --> 01:28:55.400
next three years.

01:28:55.400 --> 01:29:01.400
Pokemon Yellow is a special version that was basically like, hi, here's Pikachu.

01:29:01.400 --> 01:29:08.040
Both have been remade, by the way, as Pokemon FireRed and LeafGreen that came out in 2004.

01:29:08.040 --> 01:29:13.280
So basically, overhead perspective, you go through the fictional area of Kanto and you

01:29:13.280 --> 01:29:17.080
basically abuse your poor little animals and make Pita cry.

01:29:17.080 --> 01:29:20.200
I'm kidding because that was a fake.

01:29:20.200 --> 01:29:26.680
But you basically pit your animals against each other and see who is the greatest.

01:29:26.680 --> 01:29:32.980
Of course, you know, I love how in Japan the game was more marketed as with the adventure

01:29:32.980 --> 01:29:33.980
and everything.

01:29:33.980 --> 01:29:37.320
And yeah, the collection thing was a part of it, but it's like blatant commercialism

01:29:37.320 --> 01:29:38.320
out here.

01:29:38.320 --> 01:29:39.320
Gotta catch them all!

01:29:39.320 --> 01:29:40.320
Like rabies or something.

01:29:40.320 --> 01:29:41.320
I don't know.

01:29:41.320 --> 01:29:46.000
So anyway, you have to fight the different gym leaders and you collect badges and you

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:50.320
beat the game like a bat.

01:29:50.320 --> 01:29:56.560
So, other things about this game is that you have a little thing in there called the Pokedex.

01:29:56.560 --> 01:30:02.560
And basically for the first game you had 150 available Pokemon and you could keep track

01:30:02.560 --> 01:30:07.960
of all of them that you catch in your Pokedex and you still had to deal with Team Rocket.

01:30:07.960 --> 01:30:12.600
You could also use your game link cable to connect your games together and let you trade

01:30:12.600 --> 01:30:16.040
and battle between games, which my husband and I did quite a bit.

01:30:16.040 --> 01:30:19.840
I believe Dan played Red and I played Blue.

01:30:19.840 --> 01:30:28.200
Then there was the 151st Pokemon Mew that you could only get through official distribution

01:30:28.200 --> 01:30:35.400
by Nintendo or by a glitch and I won't say anything about getting it that way cause I

01:30:35.400 --> 01:30:36.400
got it.

01:30:36.400 --> 01:30:38.680
And Nintendo please come to your house right now.

01:30:38.680 --> 01:30:42.440
Whatever, they're a little late.

01:30:42.440 --> 01:30:48.240
So yeah, basically IGN ranked it as one of the top 100 games of all time.

01:30:48.240 --> 01:30:52.300
And in 2009 it was in the Guinness Book of World Records as best selling RPG on Game

01:30:52.300 --> 01:30:55.520
Boy and best selling RPG on Time.

01:30:55.600 --> 01:31:01.080
So basically you have the third person overhead view but when you're in your battles it switches

01:31:01.080 --> 01:31:07.040
to a behind the back of your whatever Pokemon that you're playing and you can train them

01:31:07.040 --> 01:31:08.040
out.

01:31:08.040 --> 01:31:09.040
You have up to six.

01:31:09.040 --> 01:31:14.380
You cannot teach, you know, Pokemon who would, who have wings, you have to teach them how

01:31:14.380 --> 01:31:15.380
to fly.

01:31:15.380 --> 01:31:17.420
I mean, really, what's up with that?

01:31:17.420 --> 01:31:20.600
You get experience, you level them up.

01:31:20.600 --> 01:31:27.840
You also can get some of the most useless piece of crap Pokemon ever like Magikarp.

01:31:27.840 --> 01:31:34.000
But Magikarp turns into Gyarados and I have gone through the entire game with Gyarados

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:35.400
and I haven't eaten anything else.

01:31:35.400 --> 01:31:40.840
The first time I got, did that whole wonder trade on Pokemon X and Y, somebody sent me

01:31:40.840 --> 01:31:41.840
a fucking Magikarp.

01:31:41.840 --> 01:31:46.040
But of course it was Japanese Magikarp so that made it a little cooler.

01:31:46.040 --> 01:31:47.040
Mmhmm.

01:31:47.040 --> 01:31:48.040
Oh Rob.

01:31:48.480 --> 01:31:55.320
Anyway, as far as other elements in the game, you do also have the capturing aspect, gotta

01:31:55.320 --> 01:32:01.560
catch them all, where you can find Pokemon in the wild and you can put them into a life

01:32:01.560 --> 01:32:05.320
of eternal servitude living in little balls for the rest of their existence.

01:32:05.320 --> 01:32:07.560
They're like little animal genies.

01:32:07.560 --> 01:32:08.560
Little animal genies.

01:32:08.560 --> 01:32:11.240
They come out and do cage fighting for you.

01:32:11.240 --> 01:32:12.240
Yeah.

01:32:12.640 --> 01:32:19.120
And to also say something about something that was mentioned in the last game, Pikachu

01:32:19.120 --> 01:32:20.860
is the breed, not it's name.

01:32:20.860 --> 01:32:23.560
It's like calling your dog, dog.

01:32:23.560 --> 01:32:25.440
Calling your cat, cat.

01:32:25.440 --> 01:32:28.360
I had a cat named Mr. Cat, that was a little bit more respectful.

01:32:28.360 --> 01:32:30.840
It'd be like saying Pikachu son.

01:32:30.840 --> 01:32:34.640
So anyway, there have been other versions, of course.

01:32:34.640 --> 01:32:39.440
There were Gold, Silver, and Crystal, that was a second generation.

01:32:39.440 --> 01:32:43.800
And using the transfer pack on Nintendo 64, you could actually use items from your Red

01:32:43.800 --> 01:32:47.640
and Blue in Pokemon Stadium and Pokemon Stadium 2.

01:32:47.640 --> 01:32:51.840
However, they were not compatible with the advanced generation.

01:32:51.840 --> 01:32:57.240
Which I actually had Pokemon Stadium, but I kind of didn't play it much.

01:32:57.240 --> 01:33:00.240
Really the best part about Pokemon Stadium was like, just watching your Pokemon come

01:33:00.240 --> 01:33:03.240
out and do their little poses and then it got boring.

01:33:03.240 --> 01:33:06.280
I love seeing through.

01:33:06.280 --> 01:33:09.320
Anyway, I'm looking over the shoulder.

01:33:09.320 --> 01:33:13.360
So the setting of the game takes place in Kanto.

01:33:13.360 --> 01:33:19.880
And it's got different habitats for the different Pokemon, different towns and cities, and roots

01:33:19.880 --> 01:33:22.280
that connect them all to each other.

01:33:22.280 --> 01:33:26.560
And you can get some of them only by fishing.

01:33:26.560 --> 01:33:29.760
You can get stuff like the Zubat only in the cave.

01:33:29.760 --> 01:33:38.160
So you're sent out by Professor Oak, who lets you pick one and then you are in a rivalry

01:33:38.160 --> 01:33:40.640
with Oak's grandson.

01:33:40.640 --> 01:33:45.080
And what was his name, Gary?

01:33:45.080 --> 01:33:49.080
Because I remember the character in Japan was actually named after Miyamoto, his name

01:33:49.080 --> 01:33:51.120
was Shigeru.

01:33:51.120 --> 01:33:58.280
So there's also a rumor that we were supposed to get a version of, that there had been an

01:33:58.280 --> 01:34:03.880
intention to do a version of Green that had a female trainer.

01:34:03.880 --> 01:34:06.720
But that's still on the rumor mill.

01:34:06.720 --> 01:34:10.960
Anyway, you can start off with Bulbasaur, Squirtle, or Charmander.

01:34:10.960 --> 01:34:13.680
And yeah, my first game playthrough is Bulbasaur.

01:34:13.680 --> 01:34:17.320
Every other time I've ever, you know, I switched to red and was like Charmander all the way

01:34:17.320 --> 01:34:19.440
because I didn't care.

01:34:19.440 --> 01:34:22.200
But my first playthrough was with Bulbasaur.

01:34:22.200 --> 01:34:29.000
And basically you eventually have to fight the Elite Four and the new champion who is

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:30.480
boom, your rival.

01:34:30.480 --> 01:34:32.080
So you have to kick their ass.

01:34:32.080 --> 01:34:37.600
So the whole concept of Pokemon started, and I don't know how many people know about this,

01:34:37.600 --> 01:34:44.280
that the designer Satoshi Tajiri was an insect collector.

01:34:44.280 --> 01:34:52.040
And so basically he wanted to give that same feeling of discovery, of capture, of collection

01:34:52.040 --> 01:34:58.400
like that, of live specimens into a game that people could play at any time.

01:34:58.400 --> 01:35:02.160
You wouldn't necessarily have to live out in the country for it.

01:35:02.160 --> 01:35:06.520
He was noticing that kids played more in their homes instead of outside.

01:35:06.520 --> 01:35:11.920
So he wanted to sort of give people the feeling of being able to grow up in the outside environment.

01:35:11.920 --> 01:35:16.320
And like I said, that sense of discovery.

01:35:16.320 --> 01:35:21.360
He also did not want to make games that had more, as he said, pointless violence, even

01:35:21.360 --> 01:35:24.000
though he's having animals fight each other.

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:29.760
So basically, that was the other one I was trying to remember, is that the character

01:35:29.760 --> 01:35:33.360
that you play at is named Satoshi after himself.

01:35:33.360 --> 01:35:36.480
And of course his rival is Shikaru after Miyamoto.

01:35:36.480 --> 01:35:47.960
So there's so much more about this, a lot of history that went into the production of

01:35:47.960 --> 01:35:52.440
the game.

01:35:52.440 --> 01:36:00.680
They even made some different audio advancements by using different sounds in the processor

01:36:00.680 --> 01:36:07.520
to create a snare sound using basically a white noise filter in the Game Boy, creating

01:36:07.520 --> 01:36:15.400
the animal sounds by using, the Pokemon sounds by using the, basically making it a very short

01:36:15.400 --> 01:36:16.400
chiptune.

01:36:16.400 --> 01:36:22.000
It was supposed to be originally called Capsule Monster, but there was a trademark issue,

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:27.360
they were going to call it Capamon, and basically they went to Pocket Monster, so it's Pokemon.

01:36:27.360 --> 01:36:34.760
And it was basically rejected over and over by Nintendo until Miyamoto came out with the

01:36:34.760 --> 01:36:36.400
golden way of making it work.

01:36:36.400 --> 01:36:38.320
So that's why we have it.

01:36:38.320 --> 01:36:44.800
So that's, I'm not going to go into a lot more of the detail, because really there is

01:36:44.800 --> 01:36:53.440
a whole hell of a lot about this game, but if you haven't played the original, I think

01:36:53.440 --> 01:36:54.440
you're kind of missing out.

01:36:54.440 --> 01:36:58.760
Even if you're not a big fan of Pokemon at all today, if you don't care about the new

01:36:58.760 --> 01:37:04.400
ones, I think that if anyone wants a good rounded off classic gaming background, Pokemon

01:37:04.400 --> 01:37:05.520
should be in it.

01:37:05.520 --> 01:37:07.560
So that's my final word.

01:37:07.560 --> 01:37:10.920
Alright there it is, your classic game of the week, or games of the week, Pokemon Red

01:37:10.920 --> 01:37:11.920
and Pokemon Blue.

01:37:11.920 --> 01:37:14.200
And you can add yellow into it because it was the same gen.

01:37:14.200 --> 01:37:18.440
I was going to say, my first Pokemon game was yellow, so it was the same gen.

01:37:18.440 --> 01:37:24.520
I got the see-through off-purple Game Boy color and Pokemon Yellow.

01:37:24.520 --> 01:37:28.840
Yeah, it was because of the damn anime that I loved Pokemon.

01:37:28.840 --> 01:37:33.240
You know, I had the Japanese theme song memorized for years, and I actually have, you know how

01:37:33.240 --> 01:37:37.200
you used to buy singles in those square cases with the little tiny disc inside?

01:37:37.200 --> 01:37:39.960
I actually have the Nyasu sings.

01:37:39.960 --> 01:37:40.960
Nice.

01:37:40.960 --> 01:37:42.760
Nyasu is Meowth.

01:37:42.760 --> 01:37:45.720
So it also has the full Team Rocket song on it.

01:37:45.720 --> 01:37:51.280
I squeed in the new Pokemon X and Y when wild Pikachus were showing up in the second zone

01:37:51.280 --> 01:37:52.280
you're in.

01:37:52.280 --> 01:37:55.540
I was like, yes, that's the Pokemon I want to capture, you know, that's the right call.

01:37:55.540 --> 01:38:00.120
And also, just to say, one of Shermie's nicknames was Caterpie.

01:38:00.120 --> 01:38:01.120
Just saying.

01:38:01.120 --> 01:38:04.200
It is pretty crazy to think that the games Red and Blue predated the anime.

01:38:04.200 --> 01:38:05.200
Yeah, I know, right?

01:38:05.200 --> 01:38:06.200
At least in Japan.

01:38:06.200 --> 01:38:07.520
I don't remember about America.

01:38:07.520 --> 01:38:12.720
I think that the games, I think that it was more of a simultaneous thing over here.

01:38:12.720 --> 01:38:13.720
Yeah, it was more of a simultaneous thing.

01:38:13.720 --> 01:38:15.160
Because the anime had already been out forever.

01:38:15.160 --> 01:38:18.840
And for the record, the Porygon episode totally did not make me have a seizure.

01:38:18.840 --> 01:38:19.840
Just saying.

01:38:19.840 --> 01:38:22.760
All right, we're going to take a quick break, guys.

01:38:22.760 --> 01:38:26.680
When we come back, there's plenty more OLR to come, including rapid fire news, more emails.

01:38:26.680 --> 01:38:28.360
I know we had one at the top of the show.

01:38:28.360 --> 01:38:29.360
We got more to come.

01:38:29.360 --> 01:38:31.240
Fugu question of the week and plenty, plenty more.

01:38:31.240 --> 01:38:32.240
Your calls as well.

01:38:32.240 --> 01:38:33.240
1-877-GAME-OLR.

01:38:33.240 --> 01:38:37.180
We'll be back, though, after a quick break with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:38:37.180 --> 01:38:43.720
Don't go anywhere.

01:38:43.720 --> 01:38:47.120
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:38:47.120 --> 01:38:51.380
Live on this Sunday night with episode number 525 of our show.

01:38:51.380 --> 01:38:52.380
That's a palindrome.

01:38:52.380 --> 01:38:53.900
And it's a multiple of 25.

01:38:53.900 --> 01:38:56.500
So therefore, it's an event episode tonight.

01:38:56.500 --> 01:38:57.500
Woohoo!

01:38:57.500 --> 01:39:02.820
Well, it's always an event when the awesome Jason is here with us, as he can't join us

01:39:02.820 --> 01:39:03.820
all the time.

01:39:03.820 --> 01:39:09.260
Just in a while, he's in San Francisco for work and drives up the road to come say hi.

01:39:09.260 --> 01:39:11.940
Because 22 hours to San Francisco in the first place wasn't enough.

01:39:11.940 --> 01:39:14.260
Had to do the extra two hours up to Sacramento.

01:39:14.260 --> 01:39:16.980
Do you wave the first time through?

01:39:16.980 --> 01:39:24.180
I was thinking of making a surprise stop in here because I was ... I don't remember if

01:39:24.180 --> 01:39:28.300
I was in Sacramento city limits or at least around the downtown area when the show started

01:39:28.300 --> 01:39:29.900
or if it was just after.

01:39:29.900 --> 01:39:33.400
And I probably should have, considering that I proceeded to take about four hours because

01:39:33.400 --> 01:39:39.040
of the traffic in just South Sacramento, plus the traffic in Berkeley, plus the traffic

01:39:39.040 --> 01:39:40.040
in downtown.

01:39:40.040 --> 01:39:41.920
You drove in during the BART strike.

01:39:41.920 --> 01:39:42.920
Congrats.

01:39:42.920 --> 01:39:43.920
Yeah.

01:39:43.920 --> 01:39:47.640
Yeah, that was not a very nice end to two days' worth of driving.

01:39:47.640 --> 01:39:48.640
I bet.

01:39:48.640 --> 01:39:49.640
Oh my gosh.

01:39:49.640 --> 01:39:51.880
So you drove here all the way from Colorado where you live.

01:39:51.880 --> 01:39:55.880
So do you drive nonstop and go over and sleep or where do you stop?

01:39:55.880 --> 01:39:59.580
I could do it because it's about 20, 21 hours.

01:39:59.580 --> 01:40:04.500
In this case, I left just before noon on Saturday.

01:40:04.500 --> 01:40:08.140
Drove out to Nevada, stayed in Elko, Nevada.

01:40:08.140 --> 01:40:10.140
Very tall, very small town.

01:40:10.140 --> 01:40:11.940
About central Nevada.

01:40:11.940 --> 01:40:13.540
And then continued the rest of the way.

01:40:13.540 --> 01:40:18.660
The next day I pulled into the parking lot, nine o'clock local, I think.

01:40:18.660 --> 01:40:19.660
Yeah.

01:40:19.660 --> 01:40:21.940
I was going to say, you have to account for all that traffic.

01:40:21.940 --> 01:40:24.120
So much of it too.

01:40:24.120 --> 01:40:28.160
It would have been much more, much funner and more glorious to at least spend part A

01:40:28.160 --> 01:40:29.160
down here.

01:40:29.160 --> 01:40:30.160
But, oh well.

01:40:30.160 --> 01:40:31.160
Whatever.

01:40:31.160 --> 01:40:32.160
All right.

01:40:32.160 --> 01:40:34.680
Well, let's get back into some gaming news, you guys.

01:40:34.680 --> 01:40:38.480
Jason's with us to talk about whatever he wants with the gaming news and say his opinion.

01:40:38.480 --> 01:40:40.520
Then you guys can share your opinions as well.

01:40:40.520 --> 01:40:44.440
You can either do that live with us tonight, live.vognetwork.com if you're listening to

01:40:44.440 --> 01:40:45.440
us on this Sunday night.

01:40:45.440 --> 01:40:48.960
Or, of course, if you're listening to us on the podcast, you can always tweet at us at

01:40:48.960 --> 01:40:49.960
OLR.

01:40:49.960 --> 01:40:53.840
Or you can email us, mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com.

01:40:53.840 --> 01:40:57.320
Let's check out some rapid fire news and quickly talk about a few things here.

01:40:57.320 --> 01:40:58.320
Okay.

01:40:58.320 --> 01:40:59.320
Yes.

01:40:59.320 --> 01:41:04.480
So, since there really hasn't been too much going on with Minecraft on the Xbox 360 as

01:41:04.480 --> 01:41:12.100
far as updates go, they have been putting out some skin packs to reskin the whole look

01:41:12.100 --> 01:41:16.600
of Minecraft and sometimes include free levels and stuff.

01:41:16.600 --> 01:41:19.120
They have another one coming out though for Halloween.

01:41:19.120 --> 01:41:26.160
It kind of reskins everything, makes another nice and green and everything very Halloween-y.

01:41:26.160 --> 01:41:28.000
And the price of that?

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:29.000
Free.

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:30.880
So, I think you can afford that.

01:41:30.880 --> 01:41:33.240
So, go check it out if you haven't yet.

01:41:33.240 --> 01:41:37.760
And also, creepers are nice and ghostly white now.

01:41:37.760 --> 01:41:39.680
So, that's kind of fun.

01:41:39.680 --> 01:41:41.800
And the Slenderman's about.

01:41:41.800 --> 01:41:43.200
Ah, yes.

01:41:43.200 --> 01:41:48.840
I'm assuming that they've redone the Enderman then to make him look like the Slenderman.

01:41:48.840 --> 01:41:51.040
Very clever, I guess.

01:41:51.040 --> 01:41:52.840
All right.

01:41:52.840 --> 01:41:58.640
And then, on top of that, Grand Theft Auto, since I love talking about Grand Theft Auto.

01:41:58.640 --> 01:41:59.920
Few things going on there.

01:41:59.920 --> 01:42:01.680
There's some updates in November.

01:42:01.680 --> 01:42:06.400
Some of the stuff that they were originally going to put out at launch for online, it's

01:42:06.400 --> 01:42:10.560
been kind of delayed a little bit, including the stimulus package that's not coming out

01:42:10.560 --> 01:42:17.600
now, which was supposed to have been last week, the first quarter million dollar payment.

01:42:17.600 --> 01:42:21.480
It's going to be next week, I think, or maybe even beyond that.

01:42:21.520 --> 01:42:23.720
The Beach Bum pack is something that they're going to put out.

01:42:23.720 --> 01:42:27.760
It's the first piece of DLC that's going to be free, and it's going to add some weapons

01:42:27.760 --> 01:42:34.680
and vehicles to the game, as well as clothing items, and that's both online and single player.

01:42:34.680 --> 01:42:40.080
And then also, of course, the content creator for a deathmatch and races is going to be

01:42:40.080 --> 01:42:42.760
available as well in November.

01:42:42.760 --> 01:42:47.800
And so, you'll be able to create your own deathmatches and deathmatch arenas and races

01:42:47.840 --> 01:42:54.040
in the game, which I think is going to be pretty awesome when we get to do that.

01:42:54.040 --> 01:42:59.760
And last but not least, it's been leaked out that there is a new kind of zombie mode in

01:42:59.760 --> 01:43:05.920
the game of Call of Duty Ghosts, except now, instead of zombies, it's extinction, and extinction

01:43:05.920 --> 01:43:11.120
has to do with aliens, so you're fighting off aliens instead of zombies.

01:43:11.120 --> 01:43:15.520
And they're going to have the different type of stuff to go along with that as well.

01:43:15.520 --> 01:43:18.760
So, interesting.

01:43:18.760 --> 01:43:26.040
I guess we'll learn more about that pretty soon, since the game comes out in two weeks.

01:43:26.040 --> 01:43:31.280
Or you can always get your PlayStation 4 one early and just look at the box and think about

01:43:31.280 --> 01:43:32.280
that alien mode, right?

01:43:32.280 --> 01:43:34.000
Yeah, or the Xbox One.

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:36.160
You have extra time to contemplate that alien mode.

01:43:36.160 --> 01:43:37.160
That's right.

01:43:37.160 --> 01:43:39.720
You just sit there and think about it.

01:43:39.720 --> 01:43:42.480
Killer Instinct, some more news coming out about that.

01:43:42.480 --> 01:43:46.080
In fact, I've seen some footage coming out of those Xbox One preview events of Killer

01:43:46.080 --> 01:43:47.080
Instinct.

01:43:47.080 --> 01:43:52.960
It looks nice, but I got to admit, I'm not super duper excited about it.

01:43:52.960 --> 01:43:57.440
I was hoping I'd be more excited about a new Killer Instinct, but whatever.

01:43:57.440 --> 01:44:02.640
Don't let little old me get you in a bad mood about Killer Instinct, because there are some

01:44:02.640 --> 01:44:07.440
neat things with this, including a training mode that is going to be available in the

01:44:07.440 --> 01:44:08.440
game.

01:44:08.440 --> 01:44:12.200
Killer Instinct does have a training mode, and there's some detailed information, again,

01:44:12.200 --> 01:44:14.720
coming out of the preview events there.

01:44:14.720 --> 01:44:19.960
Apparently, the highest difficulty level in the game, when you're in training mode, you

01:44:19.960 --> 01:44:24.000
can do very easy, of course, and hard and so forth, but the most difficult level is

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:26.640
something called Kyle.

01:44:26.640 --> 01:44:31.000
It's apparently named on one of the development team's AI designers, who is insanely good

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:32.000
at the game.

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:36.160
So you can fight Kyle, who I guess works there and is really, really good at Killer Instinct.

01:44:36.160 --> 01:44:37.160
I hate you, Kyle.

01:44:37.160 --> 01:44:39.160
I hate you, Kyle.

01:44:39.160 --> 01:44:42.040
I like that one.

01:44:42.080 --> 01:44:45.840
The training dummy can also do combo breakers against you, and so forth.

01:44:45.840 --> 01:44:49.360
So just different ways to kind of learn and play the game.

01:44:49.360 --> 01:44:52.480
More detailed information floating around out there on the internet.

01:44:52.480 --> 01:44:54.720
We talked earlier about Wii U Virtual Console.

01:44:54.720 --> 01:44:57.840
We were kind of joking about Virtual Console releases, and I mentioned that the past few

01:44:57.840 --> 01:45:02.400
haven't been very good, but the good news is you got a great one this week.

01:45:02.400 --> 01:45:09.600
On Halloween, nonetheless, Super Castlevania IV is the Wii U release on Virtual Console

01:45:09.600 --> 01:45:11.600
this week on Halloween.

01:45:11.640 --> 01:45:13.760
Now, I already had that when it was on the Wii.

01:45:13.760 --> 01:45:15.600
Speaking of games, I have in the box.

01:45:15.600 --> 01:45:16.600
That's right.

01:45:16.600 --> 01:45:19.480
So I can get this for a dollar if I want to get the Wii U Virtual Console version, which

01:45:19.480 --> 01:45:20.480
I probably will.

01:45:20.480 --> 01:45:21.480
You can come to my house and play it.

01:45:21.480 --> 01:45:22.480
I can, but...

01:45:22.480 --> 01:45:23.480
Dude, that would be awesome.

01:45:23.480 --> 01:45:25.400
A Castlevania festival on Halloween.

01:45:25.400 --> 01:45:26.400
But I can't...

01:45:26.400 --> 01:45:30.960
See, what I can do in my house that I can't do at your house is play Castlevania IV on

01:45:30.960 --> 01:45:31.960
the toilet.

01:45:31.960 --> 01:45:33.680
I almost said it in the toilet.

01:45:33.680 --> 01:45:34.680
On the toilet.

01:45:34.680 --> 01:45:38.360
Technically, I have a way to do this.

01:45:38.360 --> 01:45:40.400
I have extension cords and very small TVs.

01:45:40.440 --> 01:45:43.200
I guess I really shouldn't challenge you, should I?

01:45:43.200 --> 01:45:44.200
Alright.

01:45:44.200 --> 01:45:46.200
I'll think of a way.

01:45:46.200 --> 01:45:48.400
Remember, 90% of what I have done?

01:45:48.400 --> 01:45:49.400
Motivated by spite.

01:45:49.400 --> 01:45:50.400
Yes.

01:45:50.400 --> 01:45:51.400
And porn.

01:45:51.400 --> 01:45:57.640
Anyhow, that was one of, obviously, the best Super Nintendo games and best games in the

01:45:57.640 --> 01:45:59.400
Castlevania series.

01:45:59.400 --> 01:46:03.240
Not my absolute favorite in the Castlevania series, but for some people, it is their favorite.

01:46:03.240 --> 01:46:05.240
And I will say this, killer soundtrack.

01:46:05.240 --> 01:46:06.240
Some of the best.

01:46:06.240 --> 01:46:07.240
Oh, yeah.

01:46:07.240 --> 01:46:09.760
But, you know, in my esteem, nothing beats Dracula X.

01:46:10.120 --> 01:46:11.120
Symphony of the Night.

01:46:11.120 --> 01:46:13.440
I know it's cliche, but damn it.

01:46:13.440 --> 01:46:14.600
So freaking good.

01:46:14.600 --> 01:46:20.800
I would say of the traditional Castlevania games, Dracula X.

01:46:20.800 --> 01:46:23.160
Dracula X is more like a bridge between those styles.

01:46:23.160 --> 01:46:29.040
I still have a soft spot for Simon's Quest, which I think is the earliest kind of Metroidvania

01:46:29.040 --> 01:46:30.040
style game.

01:46:30.040 --> 01:46:31.040
What a terrible night for a curse.

01:46:31.040 --> 01:46:32.040
Anyway.

01:46:32.040 --> 01:46:34.420
But we're digressing again.

01:46:34.420 --> 01:46:42.700
How about some rumors about other Mario universe characters that could possibly be playable

01:46:42.700 --> 01:46:45.100
in Super Mario 3D World?

01:46:45.100 --> 01:46:49.700
There's some speculation out there because of stamp collecting that occurs in Super Mario

01:46:49.700 --> 01:46:50.880
3D World.

01:46:50.880 --> 01:46:56.440
There's some icons that have been spotted where, hmm, this kind of looks like Rosalina,

01:46:56.440 --> 01:47:00.380
who you might remember from Super Mario Galaxy.

01:47:00.380 --> 01:47:05.420
So anyhow, there's some other stamps in the game that apparently feature her there, so

01:47:05.420 --> 01:47:11.220
it's a little interesting that she's so featured in a game she's not supposed to be in.

01:47:11.220 --> 01:47:14.500
So there could be some other characters actually playable in the game.

01:47:14.500 --> 01:47:15.500
We don't know yet.

01:47:15.500 --> 01:47:18.980
This is all totally off speculation, but of course, if you didn't already know, Super

01:47:18.980 --> 01:47:25.740
Mario 3D World is going to already have Luigi, Mario, Princess, and Toad in the style of

01:47:25.740 --> 01:47:28.980
their appearance in Super Mario 2, where Princess floats.

01:47:28.980 --> 01:47:31.260
Luigi has flappy legs, and all that stuff.

01:47:31.260 --> 01:47:33.060
You mean Doki Doki Panic the ROM hack?

01:47:33.060 --> 01:47:34.060
Well, same thing.

01:47:34.060 --> 01:47:36.420
It was a little more than a ROM hack, though.

01:47:36.420 --> 01:47:40.340
I know, I stole that from Game Sack, but it was probably the best name for it I've ever

01:47:40.340 --> 01:47:41.340
heard.

01:47:41.340 --> 01:47:44.900
So that'd be pretty cool if there were some additional little hidden characters that they

01:47:44.900 --> 01:47:45.900
add into it.

01:47:45.900 --> 01:47:48.180
It'd be very interesting what they could do with that.

01:47:48.180 --> 01:47:50.300
I'm just looking forward to Cat Mario myself.

01:47:50.300 --> 01:47:52.700
Dark Soccer, what do you have for us?

01:47:52.700 --> 01:47:53.700
As stuff.

01:47:53.700 --> 01:47:54.700
And things?

01:47:54.700 --> 01:47:55.700
No, just stuff.

01:47:56.260 --> 01:48:00.460
I have a site that won't load, so I'm skipping it.

01:48:00.460 --> 01:48:05.140
And this is the very important news that everyone's been waiting for.

01:48:05.140 --> 01:48:08.660
How to avoid Pokemon X and Y's game breaking bug.

01:48:08.660 --> 01:48:13.620
First of all, you can download the patch, which is out.

01:48:13.620 --> 01:48:20.180
The patch is out there on the 3BS eShop, and you just go there, update, blah blah blah,

01:48:20.180 --> 01:48:21.180
you're done.

01:48:21.180 --> 01:48:24.780
However, other ways around...

01:48:24.780 --> 01:48:25.780
Did we finally breed?

01:48:25.780 --> 01:48:27.660
I'm literally opening up the eShop right now.

01:48:27.660 --> 01:48:28.660
I was like, oh shit, she's got a point.

01:48:28.660 --> 01:48:31.340
I thought you were checking to see if we, um, if our machines...

01:48:31.340 --> 01:48:34.260
No, our DS's do not want to mate today for some reason.

01:48:34.260 --> 01:48:36.460
Here, I'll move you over there.

01:48:36.460 --> 01:48:37.460
Very rude.

01:48:37.460 --> 01:48:39.260
I even had mine hump yours, okay?

01:48:39.260 --> 01:48:40.260
No.

01:48:40.260 --> 01:48:41.260
Um...

01:48:41.260 --> 01:48:42.260
Oh my.

01:48:42.260 --> 01:48:43.260
Scandal.

01:48:43.260 --> 01:48:50.660
Anyway, um, so the, um, other way that you could do that is that, like I said, Nintendo

01:48:50.660 --> 01:48:55.660
had put out a map that showed where the bug could occur, and so it gave you areas that

01:48:55.660 --> 01:48:58.860
you could save your game in and avoid the bug.

01:48:58.860 --> 01:49:05.220
But now, um, with the, um, the fix that's come out, it also should correct any broken

01:49:05.220 --> 01:49:06.500
game saves.

01:49:06.500 --> 01:49:11.760
So wherever you saved, if you happen to have experienced this bug, if you haven't deleted

01:49:11.760 --> 01:49:15.540
your save file, then, um, you should be fine.

01:49:15.540 --> 01:49:16.540
It will be restored.

01:49:16.540 --> 01:49:19.300
Just go to your eShop and download it.

01:49:19.300 --> 01:49:26.580
In other news, um, oh god, I was just talking about Rival Schools a moment ago, too, um,

01:49:26.580 --> 01:49:33.900
there is a, uh, some talk from, um, Hideaki Tsuno, um, who, uh, wants to create a Rival

01:49:33.900 --> 01:49:39.300
Schools 3, and Rival Schools is probably, like, my all-time favorite number one fighting

01:49:39.300 --> 01:49:41.500
game series ever in the world universe.

01:49:41.500 --> 01:49:42.500
I love it.

01:49:42.500 --> 01:49:46.700
I mean, I even like it better than all the Tekkens combined, and I really like me some

01:49:46.700 --> 01:49:47.700
Tekken.

01:49:47.700 --> 01:49:52.180
So, um, he was the past director of the Rival Schools series, and he did, um, recently did

01:49:52.180 --> 01:49:59.540
Dragon's Dogma, and, um, he basically, you know, what was, uh, said about it is that

01:49:59.540 --> 01:50:05.860
it was, it captured authentic fighting, um, as he said, basically, uh, Street Fighter

01:50:05.860 --> 01:50:08.540
2 was his, um, inspiration.

01:50:08.540 --> 01:50:13.940
So during an interview, he said, and this is with the Anime News Network, um, he said

01:50:13.940 --> 01:50:19.460
that he was real, he would really like to make, um, any Rival Schools title, which honestly,

01:50:19.460 --> 01:50:21.460
do it.

01:50:21.460 --> 01:50:22.460
No hesitation.

01:50:22.460 --> 01:50:23.460
Do it.

01:50:23.460 --> 01:50:24.460
Bring back all the characters.

01:50:24.460 --> 01:50:25.460
Put in some more.

01:50:25.460 --> 01:50:28.140
You know, we haven't had all the sports, you know, done.

01:50:28.140 --> 01:50:30.140
We need, we could have more hooligans.

01:50:30.140 --> 01:50:31.140
Yeah.

01:50:31.140 --> 01:50:32.140
We could, we could have more.

01:50:32.140 --> 01:50:34.980
I was talking about this before the show with Rob, and I was saying that I really, really

01:50:34.980 --> 01:50:36.860
miss Rival Schools Disc 2.

01:50:36.860 --> 01:50:39.220
All of those minigames were incredibly fun.

01:50:39.220 --> 01:50:43.420
Or, you know, you've had Sakura in the game now for two versions of it.

01:50:43.420 --> 01:50:48.060
I mean, she was a hidden character in the first one, and officially in, um, well, you

01:50:48.060 --> 01:50:52.420
know, I have the Evolution Disc that had, like, the dancing game and the dating sim

01:50:52.420 --> 01:50:53.720
and all that in it.

01:50:53.720 --> 01:50:58.380
I paid a hundred bucks for that sucker when I had money, and it's freaking awesome.

01:50:58.380 --> 01:51:02.620
I'll have to, I'll have to show you some stuff on it, but, like, I got, like, Batsu asked

01:51:02.620 --> 01:51:09.920
my character out, and it was all cool and cute, um, but, uh, there were, um, that's

01:51:09.920 --> 01:51:16.640
the game that introduced the Taicho, the, the class president, and, uh, the photographer,

01:51:16.640 --> 01:51:22.800
and, uh, dude who swims, why can't I remember his name, but, um, that's the game that introduced

01:51:22.800 --> 01:51:25.320
a lot of those characters that were in Rival Schools 2, and then Rival Schools 2 brought

01:51:25.320 --> 01:51:29.600
out my favorite of all time, Zaki, um, but, I mean, just think about it.

01:51:29.600 --> 01:51:32.120
It's about time.

01:51:32.120 --> 01:51:33.120
Why not?

01:51:33.120 --> 01:51:36.560
Yeah, and I'm actually, now I'm done filling time for the story that wouldn't load.

01:51:36.560 --> 01:51:37.560
Alright.

01:51:38.200 --> 01:51:40.280
I can finish one off on that note.

01:51:40.280 --> 01:51:45.600
My, you know, convinced, conventional popular still going fighting games I love, but either

01:51:45.600 --> 01:51:50.760
Rival, Rival Schools or Bloody Roar are probably my two favorites from that era.

01:51:50.760 --> 01:51:52.800
Bloody Roar was an interesting game.

01:51:52.800 --> 01:51:53.800
It's very interesting.

01:51:53.800 --> 01:51:57.080
Didn't they actually remake that in, like, the last couple years?

01:51:57.080 --> 01:51:58.080
No.

01:51:58.080 --> 01:51:59.080
I don't recall.

01:51:59.080 --> 01:52:00.080
I'm just crazy.

01:52:00.080 --> 01:52:04.920
You may be thinking of, uh, Beast Riser with the, I don't know why they call it Beast Riser.

01:52:04.920 --> 01:52:09.080
That's just such a dumb name for it, but I think that's what they came out, I think

01:52:09.080 --> 01:52:12.360
that was the Japanese name for it, because it had an arcade version of it.

01:52:12.360 --> 01:52:15.800
My ad's a rip-off of Bloody Roar, and it's the same damn name.

01:52:15.800 --> 01:52:21.960
At least it wasn't brutal Paul's a Fury, because that was kind of crap.

01:52:21.960 --> 01:52:25.560
Alright, uh, before we get to the face, or the Fugu question of the week, we skipped

01:52:25.560 --> 01:52:26.560
the story.

01:52:26.560 --> 01:52:27.560
Yeah, I was like, did you need me to do that?

01:52:27.560 --> 01:52:28.560
Because it wouldn't load on her iPad, right?

01:52:28.560 --> 01:52:33.480
Yeah, it wouldn't load at all, which, basically anything that I ever get from that site won't

01:52:33.480 --> 01:52:34.480
load.

01:52:35.040 --> 01:52:36.040
Well, here we go.

01:52:36.040 --> 01:52:39.440
Uh, this is important because it was in the intro, so we have to cover it.

01:52:39.440 --> 01:52:40.440
Sorry, sorry.

01:52:40.440 --> 01:52:41.440
No, that's fine.

01:52:41.440 --> 01:52:46.520
It has been found, the ToeJam and Earl 3, Mission to Earth.

01:52:46.520 --> 01:52:47.520
That's right.

01:52:47.520 --> 01:52:51.700
Sega apparently made that for the Xbox, of course, but did you know that there was another

01:52:51.700 --> 01:52:56.720
ToeJam and Earl 3 at one point that was being made for the Dreamcast?

01:52:56.720 --> 01:53:01.760
Some footage is now online, and apparently the owner of the disc wants to have a fundraiser

01:53:01.760 --> 01:53:03.120
to get the code online.

01:53:03.760 --> 01:53:07.760
Now, it is unfinished, it was not a finished game, so the project was never completed,

01:53:07.760 --> 01:53:09.840
but this would be the missing ToeJam and Earl game.

01:53:09.840 --> 01:53:13.680
So it is not ToeJam and Earl Xbox, but it's ToeJam and Earl 3 Dreamcast.

01:53:13.680 --> 01:53:18.080
Why not just do a Kickstarter to finish the game?

01:53:18.080 --> 01:53:21.320
That would be pretty cool, but I imagine all these developers are in different, I mean,

01:53:21.320 --> 01:53:22.320
this is coded what?

01:53:22.320 --> 01:53:23.320
This would have been like 15 years ago.

01:53:23.320 --> 01:53:24.920
Yeah, but how much of the code was done?

01:53:24.920 --> 01:53:29.360
Well, I mean, we can see some gameplay here if I kind of start it up here and fast forward

01:53:29.360 --> 01:53:30.520
just a little bit in the video.

01:53:30.560 --> 01:53:33.240
ToeJam and Earl 3 back from the dead.

01:53:33.240 --> 01:53:35.440
Yeah, they're pretty good.

01:53:35.440 --> 01:53:38.360
I mean, definitely the usual Dreamcast pop-in, but...

01:53:38.360 --> 01:53:39.360
Yeah.

01:53:39.360 --> 01:53:41.360
Ahh, crazy cheerleader.

01:53:41.360 --> 01:53:50.400
Um, so, uh, but I mean, depending on how much of it is done, if the assets are there, then

01:53:50.400 --> 01:53:55.040
I would think it used to be a matter of finishing the maybe level layouts and that type of thing.

01:53:55.040 --> 01:53:56.400
This sounds like a call for an actor.

01:53:56.400 --> 01:53:57.400
Star gladiator!

01:53:57.400 --> 01:54:00.480
Oh my god, IkumaJP, I love you forever, because Star Gladiator was awesome.

01:54:01.440 --> 01:54:03.840
All right, now we can do the FUGL question of the week, yes?

01:54:03.840 --> 01:54:04.840
I guess.

01:54:04.840 --> 01:54:05.840
I guess.

01:54:05.840 --> 01:54:09.240
All right, Dark Soccer is going to per-miss it at some point here, so here we go.

01:54:09.240 --> 01:54:10.880
You take Facebook, you take Google Plus.

01:54:10.880 --> 01:54:11.880
Per-miss.

01:54:11.880 --> 01:54:13.800
Slam those words to give permission.

01:54:13.800 --> 01:54:14.800
Per-mit.

01:54:14.800 --> 01:54:15.800
Per-whatever.

01:54:15.800 --> 01:54:19.800
It's ready to go home.

01:54:23.800 --> 01:54:28.840
Facebook and Google Plus, slam them together and you get FUGL Plus, or we just call it

01:54:28.840 --> 01:54:29.840
FUGL.

01:54:30.200 --> 01:54:33.280
I'm going to read some of the answers here, and we had a lot of answers, you guys, over

01:54:33.280 --> 01:54:34.600
on Facebook and Google Plus.

01:54:34.600 --> 01:54:35.600
I can't read them all.

01:54:35.600 --> 01:54:36.600
There is not enough time.

01:54:36.600 --> 01:54:38.600
I'm going to read some of these, though.

01:54:38.600 --> 01:54:44.200
And the question we asked this week, what is the scariest moment you've ever experienced

01:54:44.200 --> 01:54:45.200
in a video game?

01:54:45.200 --> 01:54:46.400
I mean, Halloween's next week, right?

01:54:46.400 --> 01:54:49.000
So why not ask a question about scary games?

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:50.000
In spirit.

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:53.040
How about when I thought Aerith was going to come back to life?

01:54:53.040 --> 01:54:54.040
That's a good answer.

01:54:54.040 --> 01:54:55.040
There you go.

01:54:55.040 --> 01:54:56.040
Okay.

01:54:56.040 --> 01:55:01.120
Or mine would be in probably when I was playing Silent Hill 4, The Room, and I literally screamed

01:55:01.120 --> 01:55:04.600
out loud and one of those baby face monsters came running at me and Loki was like, what

01:55:04.600 --> 01:55:05.600
the hell are you doing?

01:55:05.600 --> 01:55:06.600
It's back when we lived together.

01:55:06.600 --> 01:55:09.480
You know, the only thing that creeped me out in that game was the giant head.

01:55:09.480 --> 01:55:10.480
Oh, yeah.

01:55:10.480 --> 01:55:11.480
And not me.

01:55:11.480 --> 01:55:12.480
To just watch you.

01:55:12.480 --> 01:55:13.480
All right.

01:55:13.480 --> 01:55:14.480
Anyhow.

01:55:14.480 --> 01:55:15.480
Well, let's see what the listeners have to say, Darzara.

01:55:15.480 --> 01:55:19.520
Starting us off on Facebook, Gemit says, anything Slender Man or Outlast?

01:55:19.520 --> 01:55:22.280
I can't believe I'm opening myself for Rob to razz.

01:55:22.280 --> 01:55:26.920
Luckily, I already did that earlier in the show, and Gemit just joined chat, so he probably

01:55:26.920 --> 01:55:27.920
missed it.

01:55:27.920 --> 01:55:31.520
For the record, I officially look at it the same.

01:55:31.520 --> 01:55:32.520
Did he?

01:55:32.520 --> 01:55:33.520
What did he do?

01:55:33.520 --> 01:55:35.200
Did he help you with something on Final Fantasy?

01:55:35.200 --> 01:55:37.120
No, for admitting that you would razz.

01:55:37.120 --> 01:55:38.400
Oh, this is true.

01:55:38.400 --> 01:55:40.400
And being better than that.

01:55:40.400 --> 01:55:41.400
Very true.

01:55:41.400 --> 01:55:42.400
Let's see.

01:55:42.400 --> 01:55:43.960
Going to some other answers.

01:55:43.960 --> 01:55:49.040
Dead Rising says, after gathering like 30,000 pp and then trying to run to a save point

01:55:49.040 --> 01:55:51.480
while killing zombies on my last health bar.

01:55:51.480 --> 01:55:52.480
Scary.

01:55:52.480 --> 01:55:56.920
I think that was Mike saying the game Dead Rising, because the 30,000 points.

01:55:56.920 --> 01:55:57.920
Oh.

01:55:57.920 --> 01:56:00.800
See, when somebody writes...

01:56:00.800 --> 01:56:01.800
Thank you.

01:56:01.800 --> 01:56:05.080
When they write their name like that, I'm like, is that what you want us to call you?

01:56:05.080 --> 01:56:06.080
Okay.

01:56:06.080 --> 01:56:07.640
He's definitely talking about Dead Rising the game.

01:56:07.640 --> 01:56:09.520
I can say that with 100% certainty.

01:56:09.520 --> 01:56:10.520
There you go.

01:56:10.520 --> 01:56:11.520
It does involve zombies.

01:56:11.520 --> 01:56:12.960
Let's see.

01:56:12.960 --> 01:56:13.960
Some more answers here.

01:56:13.960 --> 01:56:17.560
Scott W says, it always comes back to the dog crashing through the window in Resident

01:56:17.560 --> 01:56:18.560
Evil.

01:56:19.080 --> 01:56:20.080
Oh, my God.

01:56:20.080 --> 01:56:21.080
I remember that.

01:56:21.080 --> 01:56:22.080
It was so scary.

01:56:22.080 --> 01:56:25.760
Strudels89 says, playing The Last of Us in the Dark with my husband.

01:56:25.760 --> 01:56:29.860
Walking around a corner, thinking we're safe, then having two clickers jump out and rip

01:56:29.860 --> 01:56:30.920
Joel's throat out.

01:56:30.920 --> 01:56:34.400
I screamed so loud and threw my controller on the bed.

01:56:34.400 --> 01:56:38.840
Catfury05 says, the first time I saw Pyramid Head in Silent Hill 2.

01:56:38.840 --> 01:56:40.200
Still scares me to this day.

01:56:40.200 --> 01:56:43.360
That was pretty creepy.

01:56:43.360 --> 01:56:45.560
Mary B says, Fatal Frame.

01:56:45.560 --> 01:56:48.960
We were in our apartment in the dark, having played for a couple hours.

01:56:48.960 --> 01:56:51.520
As Pat said, they never attack on the stairs.

01:56:51.520 --> 01:56:55.120
He was promptly attacked from above by one of those ghastly creatures, and I let out

01:56:55.120 --> 01:56:56.920
a blood curdling scream.

01:56:56.920 --> 01:57:00.980
Game controller was thrown, lights turned on, and we were done for the night.

01:57:00.980 --> 01:57:05.200
That and all of Fatal Frame's freaking celerity ghosts.

01:57:05.200 --> 01:57:06.200
Is that Mary Moo?

01:57:06.200 --> 01:57:07.200
Yes, it is.

01:57:07.200 --> 01:57:08.280
Oh, I love Mary.

01:57:08.280 --> 01:57:10.320
That is your friend, Mary.

01:57:10.320 --> 01:57:11.320
Let's see.

01:57:11.320 --> 01:57:15.800
Ray responds and says, still being a kid and playing Friday the 13th on the NES.

01:57:15.800 --> 01:57:17.800
That game was so bad.

01:57:17.800 --> 01:57:19.280
No, that game was underrated.

01:57:19.280 --> 01:57:20.280
It was good.

01:57:20.280 --> 01:57:21.280
It was awful.

01:57:21.280 --> 01:57:23.820
It was good for what it was.

01:57:23.820 --> 01:57:25.360
There were better games, yes.

01:57:25.360 --> 01:57:27.200
The Friday the 13th game was worse.

01:57:27.200 --> 01:57:28.200
Alright.

01:57:28.200 --> 01:57:30.600
Not Friday the 13th, the Nightmare on the Street game.

01:57:30.600 --> 01:57:31.600
The blah blah.

01:57:31.600 --> 01:57:32.600
Uh, let's see.

01:57:32.600 --> 01:57:34.320
Eric D says, Resident Evil 2.

01:57:34.320 --> 01:57:37.700
When you get to the jail cells in the basement and the dogs break out and start chasing you

01:57:37.700 --> 01:57:38.920
down some dark hallways.

01:57:38.920 --> 01:57:40.520
Man, that scared the crap out of me.

01:57:40.520 --> 01:57:43.600
So there's another one for dogs in Resident Evil.

01:57:43.600 --> 01:57:44.600
Let's see.

01:57:44.600 --> 01:57:47.280
Justin M says, the opening of Half Life 2 was pretty unnerving.

01:57:47.280 --> 01:57:50.220
As was the in-browser boogeyman movie tie-in game.

01:57:50.220 --> 01:57:54.520
Scared the bejesus out of me freshman year of college.

01:57:54.520 --> 01:57:59.360
K. Sera Sera says, I don't play a lot of scary games really, but the first one that

01:57:59.360 --> 01:58:04.200
ever creeped me out was the first adventure game that I ever played, Sanitarium.

01:58:04.200 --> 01:58:07.920
There was a level where you were exploring an abandoned mental hospital with remnants

01:58:07.920 --> 01:58:09.360
of bodies laying around.

01:58:09.360 --> 01:58:13.400
The combination of this gross empty hospital, the creepy music, and the main character's

01:58:13.400 --> 01:58:16.880
inner monologue definitely left me creeped out.

01:58:16.880 --> 01:58:19.600
So those are only some of the answers, and I'm sorry I didn't read them all, but those

01:58:19.600 --> 01:58:24.080
are some of the answers from our Facebook page over at Facebook.com slash Orange Launch

01:58:24.080 --> 01:58:25.080
Radio.

01:58:25.080 --> 01:58:27.440
Please go read the rest, because there's some great answers involving, like, Oculus Rift

01:58:27.440 --> 01:58:30.040
and some other stuff too, so check it out.

01:58:30.040 --> 01:58:32.600
Going to Google Plus and reading some answers there.

01:58:32.600 --> 01:58:36.760
The birthday boy, ActDeft, says, playing a version on PC.

01:58:36.760 --> 01:58:40.600
It starts out sweet and nice, and then the game starts messing with you in really freaked

01:58:40.600 --> 01:58:41.600
out ways.

01:58:41.600 --> 01:58:45.240
I played and finished the game in one sitting, but I was alone in my house and it was getting

01:58:45.240 --> 01:58:48.960
dark too, so I really got scared as I progressed through it.

01:58:48.960 --> 01:58:54.120
And lastly, Colin M. says, the PC version of Slender freaked me out sometime between

01:58:54.120 --> 01:58:56.200
finding the fifth and sixth pages.

01:58:56.200 --> 01:58:59.860
My flashlight had burned out and I was basically running around in the dark before the Slender

01:58:59.860 --> 01:59:00.860
Man caught me.

01:59:00.860 --> 01:59:03.280
Yeah, Slender Man, super scary game.

01:59:03.280 --> 01:59:07.920
I don't know, until you've played it so many times, you kind of start to figure out the

01:59:07.920 --> 01:59:12.200
patterns and it's numbed a little bit, but still a really good experience.

01:59:12.200 --> 01:59:14.040
IKUMA JP just made my heart leap.

01:59:14.040 --> 01:59:16.440
There was a Ju-On game for Wii.

01:59:16.440 --> 01:59:17.440
Was it really?

01:59:17.440 --> 01:59:18.440
Are you serious?

01:59:18.440 --> 01:59:19.440
And I need this in my life.

01:59:19.440 --> 01:59:20.440
I didn't know.

01:59:20.440 --> 01:59:21.440
Oh yeah, I remember that.

01:59:21.440 --> 01:59:22.440
It was terrible.

01:59:22.440 --> 01:59:23.440
What?

01:59:23.440 --> 01:59:24.440
You said it was good.

01:59:24.440 --> 01:59:25.440
Didn't you say that?

01:59:25.440 --> 01:59:26.440
No, I remember that came out a few years ago.

01:59:26.440 --> 01:59:27.440
No, you just said it was scary.

01:59:27.440 --> 01:59:30.200
And I remember telling everybody about that multiple times, especially you.

01:59:30.200 --> 01:59:33.120
Yeah, well, I don't remember that because I don't pay attention to the Wii.

01:59:33.120 --> 01:59:34.120
It's been a while.

01:59:34.120 --> 01:59:36.640
I need this in my life and I don't care how bad it is.

01:59:36.640 --> 01:59:40.640
I played the Project Runway game on Wii, which was pretty bad, but it's just a thing.

01:59:40.640 --> 01:59:41.640
You have to try it.

01:59:41.640 --> 01:59:45.600
I remember a scary moment when I thought my save file got corrupted.

01:59:45.600 --> 01:59:48.400
I remember another scary moment in games.

01:59:48.400 --> 01:59:49.400
Actually I thought of one.

01:59:49.400 --> 01:59:52.120
What was the Silent Hill on 360 called?

01:59:52.120 --> 01:59:53.120
The first one.

01:59:53.120 --> 01:59:54.120
Silent Hill Homecoming?

01:59:54.120 --> 01:59:55.120
Yes, Homecoming.

01:59:55.120 --> 01:59:56.120
Homecoming was good.

01:59:56.120 --> 01:59:57.120
I played that.

01:59:57.120 --> 01:59:59.620
With that kid.

01:59:59.620 --> 02:00:04.700
And I was home by myself in the dark and it was raining outside.

02:00:04.700 --> 02:00:08.620
And you know how like when you're in the hospital in the very beginning, like a body falls just

02:00:08.620 --> 02:00:12.140
from the air duct or something, like it just falls down in front of you?

02:00:12.140 --> 02:00:15.140
You go, let the bodies hit the...

02:00:15.140 --> 02:00:17.860
Well, I screamed and jumped out of my chair.

02:00:17.860 --> 02:00:22.520
And because it was storming outside, the front door blew open.

02:00:22.520 --> 02:00:26.900
And I promptly, like you can even see, step one, ran, slammed the door.

02:00:26.900 --> 02:00:29.740
Step two, closed off the Xbox without even saving.

02:00:29.740 --> 02:00:32.660
Step three, ran into the bedroom and got into the covers and cried.

02:00:32.660 --> 02:00:33.660
I didn't really cry.

02:00:33.660 --> 02:00:39.220
At least you said it was the Xbox, because if it was the Wii or the GameCube or something,

02:00:39.220 --> 02:00:44.140
there is a potential that Rosetti may have come back and given you a nice long lecture

02:00:44.140 --> 02:00:46.020
afterwards, which is equally scary.

02:00:46.020 --> 02:00:49.700
Now there is a game that I mentioned in chat that I haven't heard anyone say anything about.

02:00:49.700 --> 02:00:50.700
What's that?

02:00:50.700 --> 02:00:51.700
Phantasmagoria.

02:00:51.700 --> 02:00:52.700
Oh yeah, the old PC.

02:00:52.700 --> 02:00:55.260
Which I have covered as a classic game.

02:00:55.300 --> 02:00:57.980
Wasn't that Roberta Williams' last game or like one of her last games?

02:00:57.980 --> 02:00:58.980
I think so.

02:00:58.980 --> 02:00:59.980
Yeah, before she...

02:00:59.980 --> 02:01:04.180
But I mean, that game was pretty hardcore for its time.

02:01:04.180 --> 02:01:06.100
It was way ahead of its time.

02:01:06.100 --> 02:01:09.340
And it was literally on seven or eight CDs.

02:01:09.340 --> 02:01:10.340
It was seven.

02:01:10.340 --> 02:01:12.100
It was all that...

02:01:12.100 --> 02:01:15.340
That was during that phase, we had a really quick phase in gaming, it was right around

02:01:15.340 --> 02:01:16.340
the same time as the Sega CD.

02:01:16.340 --> 02:01:17.340
The full motion.

02:01:17.340 --> 02:01:19.140
Yeah, the full motion acting.

02:01:19.140 --> 02:01:20.900
Dan and I were actually just talking about that earlier today.

02:01:20.900 --> 02:01:24.380
Because you had what, like Sewer Shark and Night Trap are some infamous Sega CD games

02:01:24.380 --> 02:01:25.380
that had that.

02:01:25.380 --> 02:01:29.660
Was it Super Soldier or some other game like that, that was a 32X CD game?

02:01:29.660 --> 02:01:30.660
Well, I remember...

02:01:30.660 --> 02:01:34.500
That only came out in some country, I don't remember.

02:01:34.500 --> 02:01:39.620
Well, I remember on the PC you had Phantasmagoria, Seventh Guest was a huge one, and you're seeing

02:01:39.620 --> 02:01:40.620
that.

02:01:40.620 --> 02:01:41.620
They just re-released that on Steam.

02:01:41.620 --> 02:01:42.620
And what was the sequel, Eleventh Hour?

02:01:42.620 --> 02:01:43.620
Eleventh Hour.

02:01:43.620 --> 02:01:48.140
And then, of course, SimCity with SimCity Action News.

02:01:48.140 --> 02:01:49.140
Wing Commander.

02:01:49.140 --> 02:01:50.980
The X-Files was on like eight or nine disc.

02:01:50.980 --> 02:01:52.580
Wasn't Wing Commander 3 that one?

02:01:52.580 --> 02:01:53.580
I only remember four.

02:01:53.780 --> 02:01:54.780
I don't remember the first couple.

02:01:54.780 --> 02:01:55.780
Wing Commander 3 was the one with Mark Hamill in it.

02:01:55.780 --> 02:01:56.780
Yeah, I think so.

02:01:56.780 --> 02:01:57.780
I believe so.

02:01:57.780 --> 02:01:58.780
Gabriel Knight.

02:01:58.780 --> 02:01:59.780
Yeah.

02:01:59.780 --> 02:02:00.780
Gabriel Knight.

02:02:00.780 --> 02:02:01.780
Tim Tripp just said.

02:02:01.780 --> 02:02:02.780
Tim Tripp.

02:02:02.780 --> 02:02:03.780
Yeah.

02:02:03.780 --> 02:02:04.780
Didn't Gabriel Knight have Tim Curry?

02:02:04.780 --> 02:02:05.780
I think it was just acted.

02:02:05.780 --> 02:02:06.780
Maybe it was in the sequel.

02:02:06.780 --> 02:02:07.780
Yeah.

02:02:07.780 --> 02:02:12.420
But, I mean, there were tons of different horror games out that, you know, I'm sure

02:02:12.420 --> 02:02:13.420
scared people.

02:02:13.420 --> 02:02:18.620
But going back to the day, even old, you know, text games, I mean, being eaten by a grue

02:02:18.620 --> 02:02:19.620
is pretty scary.

02:02:19.620 --> 02:02:20.620
It is pretty scary.

02:02:20.620 --> 02:02:21.620
Very scary.

02:02:21.660 --> 02:02:22.660
All right.

02:02:22.660 --> 02:02:25.940
Let's do a few more stories and then the mailbag and phone calls and all that.

02:02:25.940 --> 02:02:26.940
So, Loki.

02:02:26.940 --> 02:02:27.940
All right.

02:02:27.940 --> 02:02:31.940
So, the Ouya.

02:02:31.940 --> 02:02:33.660
They changed a few things.

02:02:33.660 --> 02:02:36.700
One, they're redesigning the controller for the Ouya 2.

02:02:36.700 --> 02:02:38.580
Yes, the Ouya 2 will be out next year.

02:02:38.580 --> 02:02:41.380
At least that's what's planned right now.

02:02:41.380 --> 02:02:43.860
And they're going back and redesigning the controller.

02:02:43.860 --> 02:02:47.460
Actually, I think they've already redesigned the controller now and I'm kind of like confused

02:02:47.460 --> 02:02:50.340
by it because I know that they redesigned the controller from when they kickstarted

02:02:50.340 --> 02:02:52.820
to when they released.

02:02:52.820 --> 02:02:55.940
But now they're talking about redesigning it again.

02:02:55.940 --> 02:03:01.180
And one of the questions was, so, how am I going to know if I buy an Ouya if it's going

02:03:01.180 --> 02:03:04.380
to be the one that has the redesigned controller that's supposed to be better or the older

02:03:04.380 --> 02:03:07.240
one that the controller is not so good?

02:03:07.240 --> 02:03:13.580
And Julie, Julie Ehrman said, you don't know.

02:03:13.580 --> 02:03:16.100
So that's a great answer.

02:03:16.100 --> 02:03:17.780
There is no way to distinguish that.

02:03:17.780 --> 02:03:25.620
And of course, they're right now planning on shipping the Ouya 2, I guess, sometime

02:03:25.620 --> 02:03:28.820
in 2014.

02:03:28.820 --> 02:03:33.020
And they haven't finalized the date on it yet, but they're kind of investigating right

02:03:33.020 --> 02:03:36.800
now what kind of graphics chip they want to put inside there to be able to support the

02:03:36.800 --> 02:03:43.220
older games as well as push a little bit better performance out of newer games and titles.

02:03:43.220 --> 02:03:47.240
I understand them bringing out another console so that they can find their happy medium and

02:03:47.240 --> 02:03:50.680
find what's going to work and be relatively future proof.

02:03:50.680 --> 02:03:54.080
But two consoles in two years.

02:03:54.080 --> 02:04:00.040
I don't if the apology if they make that if they make that a trend, it just seems really

02:04:00.040 --> 02:04:02.440
stupid for something that's supposed to be an Internet console.

02:04:02.440 --> 02:04:04.560
Aren't you an iPhone user?

02:04:04.560 --> 02:04:14.880
I just say point point, but I'm just saying I'm still using my 4S and and keep in mind

02:04:14.880 --> 02:04:18.760
all of their all quality products as opposed to the Ouya.

02:04:18.760 --> 02:04:23.920
Yeah, you don't have to buy every revision they they bring it forward because they have

02:04:23.920 --> 02:04:24.920
new things.

02:04:24.920 --> 02:04:29.800
I'm still I'm still rocking my iPad third generation, aka the one that Apple would rather

02:04:29.800 --> 02:04:31.160
you just forget about.

02:04:31.160 --> 02:04:35.520
You know, this is the only other iPad they still sell the iPad 2.

02:04:35.520 --> 02:04:36.520
Right?

02:04:36.520 --> 02:04:37.520
Yes.

02:04:37.520 --> 02:04:40.000
And all I have to say to hell with the iPad Air.

02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:42.840
I'm still going to rock that iPad third generation do it.

02:04:42.840 --> 02:04:43.840
That's right.

02:04:43.840 --> 02:04:45.680
I got a display in my old school charger.

02:04:45.680 --> 02:04:48.720
It's all I need to do it.

02:04:48.720 --> 02:04:49.720
Loki's like, can I finish?

02:04:49.720 --> 02:04:51.720
We're also talking about like a six hundred dollar difference.

02:04:51.720 --> 02:04:52.720
But please.

02:04:52.720 --> 02:04:54.040
Well, here's the thing, too.

02:04:54.040 --> 02:04:58.920
The problem, though, with coming out with an Ouya 2.0 or whatever is you're not coming

02:04:58.920 --> 02:05:00.500
out now first anymore.

02:05:00.500 --> 02:05:05.720
Now you're coming out in potentially a field where there are going to be multiple consoles

02:05:05.720 --> 02:05:10.120
out there that do the same type of thing, whose amateurs will blow yours away.

02:05:10.120 --> 02:05:11.120
Exactly.

02:05:11.120 --> 02:05:15.120
You can do your thing better and for probably cheaper.

02:05:15.120 --> 02:05:19.160
And one of the things that, you know, she's basically said, oh, hey, you know what?

02:05:19.160 --> 02:05:23.360
We're open to cloud gaming and hey, we're even open to our storefront being on third

02:05:23.360 --> 02:05:24.360
party hardware.

02:05:24.360 --> 02:05:25.780
We'll do anything.

02:05:25.780 --> 02:05:27.120
So we'll blow anyone.

02:05:27.120 --> 02:05:30.200
Why the fuck would I want to buy an Ouya 2?

02:05:30.200 --> 02:05:33.680
We're open to putting a flashlight in the side of the console.

02:05:33.680 --> 02:05:37.120
And it says that if they really wanted to be clever, they are passing up a fantastic

02:05:37.120 --> 02:05:38.560
marketing idea.

02:05:38.560 --> 02:05:39.560
The 2.0.

02:05:39.560 --> 02:05:40.560
I'm just saying.

02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:44.320
I'm just saying if they put a flashlight in a porn edition, that's what people really

02:05:44.320 --> 02:05:45.320
want.

02:05:45.320 --> 02:05:47.360
If they put a flashlight in the side of that console, it's going to have to be for really

02:05:47.360 --> 02:05:50.240
small dick people because that is a really small console.

02:05:50.240 --> 02:05:55.360
I just know the flashlight will be bigger than the console.

02:05:55.360 --> 02:06:00.400
So what you're saying is it will look like a giant cylinder, a.k.a. the new Mac that

02:06:00.400 --> 02:06:01.400
they have out there.

02:06:01.400 --> 02:06:03.640
It looks like a fucking trash can.

02:06:03.640 --> 02:06:05.400
It actually does.

02:06:05.400 --> 02:06:06.400
I can't argue it.

02:06:06.400 --> 02:06:10.280
I can like say it's way sage and give this shit.

02:06:10.280 --> 02:06:11.520
It's expensive.

02:06:11.520 --> 02:06:13.880
It does slightly better things than the last one.

02:06:13.880 --> 02:06:20.960
You'll release yet another computer in a year or two that will look stupid and will do something

02:06:20.960 --> 02:06:23.840
slightly better than the other one will be fucking expensive and everyone will go buy

02:06:23.840 --> 02:06:24.840
it.

02:06:24.840 --> 02:06:30.800
The other problem with the Ouya is that because they didn't discontinue the Wii in North America,

02:06:30.800 --> 02:06:36.240
you can get a dirt fucking cheap console here that plays a heck of a lot more games than

02:06:36.240 --> 02:06:37.880
what's really available on Ouya.

02:06:37.880 --> 02:06:38.880
I gotta be honest.

02:06:39.600 --> 02:06:46.280
If you're out there in the market and you're like, hell, I need a system to play Android

02:06:46.280 --> 02:06:53.380
games on my TV and that's what I wanna do, go with the fucking Mojo console because at

02:06:53.380 --> 02:07:00.160
least that one uses Google Play for one and two, you can use your controller and map it

02:07:00.160 --> 02:07:02.380
to pretty much any game you want.

02:07:02.380 --> 02:07:08.200
So that includes stuff that's probably on the Ouya already and stuff that's in the Google

02:07:08.200 --> 02:07:10.280
Play marketplace that's free.

02:07:10.280 --> 02:07:17.960
So why would you spend money on this stuff that has a locked out marketplace, which let

02:07:17.960 --> 02:07:18.960
me put it this way.

02:07:18.960 --> 02:07:20.560
I had the console for a while.

02:07:20.560 --> 02:07:22.240
There are some okay games on there.

02:07:22.240 --> 02:07:25.480
They're promising there's gonna be more games on there that'll be good, but you know what?

02:07:25.480 --> 02:07:28.960
All those people, they're fucking not just making their games exclusively to the Ouya.

02:07:28.960 --> 02:07:32.000
It's coming out in PC and Android and all that stuff.

02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:38.200
So you might as well just put the money into a Steam box or a computer that runs Steam

02:07:38.200 --> 02:07:43.200
or something or put it into another micro console or just fucking just...

02:07:43.200 --> 02:07:47.400
Or give it to me and we'll buy a new mic for the show or something.

02:07:47.400 --> 02:07:49.400
Just don't waste your money on this stuff.

02:07:49.400 --> 02:07:51.000
We could use a new mic.

02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:54.760
Or buy a used Ouya, I mean, if you really want to.

02:07:54.760 --> 02:07:55.760
I don't know.

02:07:55.760 --> 02:07:57.780
I just don't see, there's not a lot.

02:07:57.780 --> 02:08:00.660
There's no real reason why you want to get a new Ouya.

02:08:00.660 --> 02:08:08.580
Because they were saying before, oh, you're gonna be able to run XBMC on it and stuff.

02:08:08.580 --> 02:08:12.160
Well except it doesn't run it very well, so why would you do that?

02:08:12.160 --> 02:08:18.760
You can get really cheap tablets nowadays and a lot of them already have HDMI out.

02:08:18.760 --> 02:08:23.580
So I don't know, especially with what?

02:08:23.580 --> 02:08:26.920
The Google thing that they have now where you can plug it into your TV and more support

02:08:26.960 --> 02:08:27.960
for apps for that.

02:08:27.960 --> 02:08:28.960
Chromecast.

02:08:28.960 --> 02:08:34.040
Yeah Chromecast, you don't really need a micro console because a lot of other shit is doing

02:08:34.040 --> 02:08:35.040
this stuff already.

02:08:35.040 --> 02:08:39.920
It's like Dan and I were talking this morning about taking, because we're probably gonna

02:08:39.920 --> 02:08:45.360
eventually gut our front room computer and put it in a new frame and I was like, well

02:08:45.360 --> 02:08:48.880
you have people who build like the Nintendo computers with the small bits.

02:08:48.880 --> 02:08:55.120
I've wanted to do one out of a 1950s radio, but I mean you can build these things for

02:08:55.120 --> 02:08:59.000
yourself at home and they'll run whatever you need them to run within reason.

02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:03.700
You know, coming by parts is just a matter of smart shopping.

02:09:03.700 --> 02:09:07.400
Especially if you're gonna make a system, if all you're interested in is emulators,

02:09:07.400 --> 02:09:10.760
you don't need that powerful of a system to run emulators.

02:09:10.760 --> 02:09:11.760
I mean seriously.

02:09:11.760 --> 02:09:13.800
Get a Dreamcast.

02:09:13.800 --> 02:09:17.120
Just buy a fucking old ass PC, you can probably do that.

02:09:17.120 --> 02:09:20.240
Yeah Dreamcast, but Dreamcast even that doesn't run everything very smoothly.

02:09:20.240 --> 02:09:21.240
It'll run Nintendo.

02:09:21.240 --> 02:09:25.720
You still have to go through some hoops for that, but just get an old PC.

02:09:25.720 --> 02:09:30.360
That's what our front room computer that we have was pretty much given to us when someone

02:09:30.360 --> 02:09:31.360
was done with it.

02:09:31.360 --> 02:09:33.360
I think it was Dan's mom or somebody.

02:09:33.360 --> 02:09:37.960
But I mean all we use it for is emulator games so we don't feel like busting out the Super

02:09:37.960 --> 02:09:43.240
Nintendo and watching Netflix and Hulu.

02:09:43.240 --> 02:09:44.240
That's it.

02:09:44.240 --> 02:09:49.120
And also if you're interested in buying a Ouya and god forbid they kickstart something

02:09:49.120 --> 02:09:53.740
else again, just remember how wonderful the Kickstarter went the first time around.

02:09:53.740 --> 02:09:55.200
Ask up front who's shipping.

02:09:55.200 --> 02:10:01.200
As in, as in right now, some people that backed that Kickstarter still don't have their fucking

02:10:01.200 --> 02:10:02.880
console yet.

02:10:02.880 --> 02:10:03.880
Just saying.

02:10:03.880 --> 02:10:10.080
And for the record, at Radio Shack where my husband manages, I saw laptops there that

02:10:10.080 --> 02:10:15.520
were fully equipped to do everything that the Ouya can do for 250 bucks.

02:10:15.520 --> 02:10:20.600
So you can get a laptop instead of getting that piece of garbage.

02:10:20.600 --> 02:10:21.600
It's still not 99.

02:10:21.600 --> 02:10:22.600
It's still not 99.

02:10:22.600 --> 02:10:23.600
All right.

02:10:23.600 --> 02:10:24.600
Yeah, but you get a lot more value.

02:10:24.600 --> 02:10:26.240
It was to say that the next one's going to be $99.

02:10:26.240 --> 02:10:27.240
That's the other thing too.

02:10:27.240 --> 02:10:28.240
All right.

02:10:28.240 --> 02:10:29.240
Moving on.

02:10:29.240 --> 02:10:30.240
Moving on, guys.

02:10:30.240 --> 02:10:35.120
I it's a another week, so there must be another story coming out of EA somewhere that's hating

02:10:35.120 --> 02:10:36.680
on the Wii U.

02:10:36.680 --> 02:10:39.120
And here we go.

02:10:39.120 --> 02:10:42.620
Creative director Craig Sullivan from Ghost Games.

02:10:42.620 --> 02:10:45.400
So technically it's not EA, but you know.

02:10:45.400 --> 02:10:49.040
So Craig Sullivan with Ghost Games is making Need for Speed Rivals.

02:10:49.040 --> 02:10:54.120
And in an interview with the Sixaxis talks about why it's not coming to the Wii U.

02:10:54.120 --> 02:10:59.160
Rivals is going on new hardware and you have to work out where you focus your efforts.

02:10:59.160 --> 02:11:03.760
The 200 people working on this game are only capable of so much and doing so many different

02:11:03.760 --> 02:11:04.800
versions of the game.

02:11:04.800 --> 02:11:08.320
So we had to go with where we think the biggest audience will be for the game.

02:11:08.320 --> 02:11:10.520
And that's where we are.

02:11:10.520 --> 02:11:15.160
As you may or may not know, Need for Speed Rivals is running on the Frostbite 3 engine.

02:11:15.160 --> 02:11:18.660
This year we had news that they're not going to bother with putting Frostbite 3 engine

02:11:18.660 --> 02:11:23.240
on the Wii U, back when EA kind of first was talking about how they're distancing themselves

02:11:23.240 --> 02:11:27.400
from the Wii U, because the Wii U can't handle it or whatever, which means it's not going

02:11:27.400 --> 02:11:29.200
to get Dragon Age or Mass Effect.

02:11:29.200 --> 02:11:32.040
It's not going to get any of that, because those are all going to be on the Frostbite

02:11:32.040 --> 02:11:34.800
3 engine as well.

02:11:34.800 --> 02:11:36.680
So there you go.

02:11:36.680 --> 02:11:40.640
Need for Speed Rivals not coming on the Wii U anytime soon.

02:11:40.640 --> 02:11:47.280
And stories like this are never really a great sign for that system, but Nintendo is going

02:11:47.280 --> 02:11:52.400
to keep pumping out their games that will carry that system well enough.

02:11:52.400 --> 02:11:57.600
And I also kind of think, I've got to be really honest here when it comes to the whole journalism

02:11:57.600 --> 02:12:03.760
element of this story, I kind of think in this interview you're baiting this guy to

02:12:03.760 --> 02:12:05.460
hate on the Wii U.

02:12:05.460 --> 02:12:09.740
Because I think when you look at a game like Need for Speed Rivals, or a lot of the stuff

02:12:09.860 --> 02:12:15.860
that goes to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, you know the Wii U can't handle that stuff.

02:12:15.860 --> 02:12:21.620
Like, you know, the Wii U is based a little more off the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, granted

02:12:21.620 --> 02:12:25.460
what's in there is a little more powerful, but we all kind of know that what's inside

02:12:25.460 --> 02:12:29.940
a Wii U is not the same thing that's inside these other systems.

02:12:29.940 --> 02:12:32.580
So weren't we kind of baiting this guy a little bit?

02:12:32.580 --> 02:12:36.140
Isn't the answer obvious why this game is not on Wii U?

02:12:36.140 --> 02:12:41.220
Well, it's like you said, that they're making it for multiple consoles, and so they only

02:12:41.220 --> 02:12:45.660
have enough, okay we can only put it on X number of different consoles, and so we're

02:12:45.660 --> 02:12:48.900
going to pick the ones that have what we think are going to be the largest market share.

02:12:48.900 --> 02:12:50.420
I mean, that just makes sense.

02:12:50.420 --> 02:12:53.220
But yes, they are masturbators.

02:12:53.220 --> 02:12:57.460
Dark Tetsuya in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, this story frustrates me, because I

02:12:57.460 --> 02:13:01.740
love Need for Speed and I want a Wii U, and that customization stuff would be perfect

02:13:01.740 --> 02:13:02.740
for the touchpad.

02:13:03.340 --> 02:13:08.340
Yeah, it's kind of a bummer, more people don't think to do it, but...

02:13:08.340 --> 02:13:13.820
If only, you know, the Xbox 360 had a second screen app or something that you could, you

02:13:13.820 --> 02:13:16.900
know, use the touchpad to do customization.

02:13:16.900 --> 02:13:18.820
If only they had that!

02:13:18.820 --> 02:13:22.620
Didn't you listen to Bobby's show earlier tonight, when our good pal Bobby Blackwolf

02:13:22.620 --> 02:13:24.780
always tapes before us here at VOG Network.

02:13:24.780 --> 02:13:28.660
He was talking about, he went to the Xbox One preview event in Atlanta, and was like

02:13:28.700 --> 02:13:34.100
asking questions about, now I don't even remember the name of it, Smart Glass.

02:13:34.100 --> 02:13:37.100
I just think Smart Ass, like Smart Ass, like Loki, but it's Smart Glass.

02:13:37.100 --> 02:13:39.300
You mean that app I downloaded that I've never used?

02:13:39.300 --> 02:13:43.060
They didn't even know what it was.

02:13:43.060 --> 02:13:45.700
The people that were demoing, like, because he asked one of the games he was playing,

02:13:45.700 --> 02:13:47.620
he was like, oh, how does this integrate Smart Glass?

02:13:47.620 --> 02:13:51.700
Because it had a really kind of, it was like drawing, and they were like, what's Smart

02:13:51.700 --> 02:13:52.700
Glass?

02:13:52.700 --> 02:13:53.700
I...

02:13:53.700 --> 02:13:54.700
What?

02:13:54.700 --> 02:13:55.700
What?

02:13:55.700 --> 02:13:57.220
That definitely is deserved.

02:13:57.220 --> 02:13:58.820
Mark Zuckerberg will know what I'm talking about with this.

02:13:58.820 --> 02:14:04.580
That's definitely a moment where you just kind of look at that person and go, girl.

02:14:04.580 --> 02:14:09.340
It's kind of funny, because there's a lot of opportunity in theory with the surface

02:14:09.340 --> 02:14:11.340
for stuff like that.

02:14:11.340 --> 02:14:12.340
Right?

02:14:12.340 --> 02:14:14.460
Well, anyway.

02:14:14.460 --> 02:14:18.960
It's like, you've got all this second screen technology, like slapping you in the face,

02:14:18.960 --> 02:14:21.620
and still nobody wants to jump on boards.

02:14:21.620 --> 02:14:24.100
Except Nintendo, sorta.

02:14:24.100 --> 02:14:27.860
Although certainly there's those wank rumors that they're thinking about releasing a new

02:14:27.860 --> 02:14:30.740
Wii that doesn't have the touchpad, so they can rule the button.

02:14:30.740 --> 02:14:31.740
A Wii U?

02:14:31.740 --> 02:14:32.740
Yeah, that's what I meant.

02:14:32.740 --> 02:14:33.740
The Wii U without the touchpad.

02:14:33.740 --> 02:14:34.740
But I don't know.

02:14:34.740 --> 02:14:37.060
And again, wank, wank, wank, wank, wank.

02:14:37.060 --> 02:14:38.980
I don't know how much stock I put in there.

02:14:38.980 --> 02:14:39.980
Why?

02:14:39.980 --> 02:14:44.460
At that point, it's like, you're taking the gimmick out, so now there's no reason.

02:14:44.460 --> 02:14:45.780
It is...

02:14:45.780 --> 02:14:48.220
Yeah, because that worked so well with the Wii Mini.

02:14:48.220 --> 02:14:51.660
They took out all the extra features that you didn't really need, like internet, you

02:14:51.660 --> 02:14:52.660
know, and...

02:14:52.660 --> 02:14:55.220
Back and focus on what made the Wii so popular.

02:14:55.220 --> 02:14:57.620
All that, the flailing with the controller.

02:14:57.620 --> 02:14:58.620
Why not?

02:14:58.620 --> 02:15:00.620
Wii Sports HD, buddy.

02:15:00.620 --> 02:15:03.140
It's coming.

02:15:03.140 --> 02:15:09.320
Anyhow, let's see what the listeners think in a segment we call the Mailbag.

02:15:09.320 --> 02:15:13.740
Every week, you guys send us emails, mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com, and Dark Soccer

02:15:13.740 --> 02:15:20.140
will dive into the mailbag headfirst and find some emails that she deems worthy of being

02:15:20.140 --> 02:15:21.140
read here on the show.

02:15:21.140 --> 02:15:22.140
I know we...

02:15:22.140 --> 02:15:23.140
I gotta...

02:15:23.140 --> 02:15:26.540
We spoiled this a little bit earlier in the show with one email, but there's still plenty

02:15:26.540 --> 02:15:29.140
more unlicked, unspoiled emails to go.

02:15:29.140 --> 02:15:30.140
We got a bunch.

02:15:30.140 --> 02:15:31.140
We did get a lot tonight, didn't we?

02:15:31.140 --> 02:15:33.140
We got a couple more, actually, after checking the mailbag.

02:15:33.140 --> 02:15:34.620
Oh, you don't have to read them all, you know?

02:15:34.620 --> 02:15:36.140
Well, I'm gonna, because Gonna emailed.

02:15:36.140 --> 02:15:37.140
All right.

02:15:37.140 --> 02:15:38.140
Well, you can skip his.

02:15:38.140 --> 02:15:39.140
Shit.

02:15:39.140 --> 02:15:40.140
You know what?

02:15:40.140 --> 02:15:41.140
I'm just kidding.

02:15:41.140 --> 02:15:43.140
Hi, Jamie, Loki, and I guess Rob.

02:15:43.140 --> 02:15:44.900
You see what I mean?

02:15:44.900 --> 02:15:45.900
Yeah.

02:15:45.900 --> 02:15:49.460
I heard Rob talking about Pokemon not really utilizing the 3D, and I was curious if you

02:15:49.460 --> 02:15:52.900
guys think it's even worth it to buy the 3DS or just go with the 2DS.

02:15:52.900 --> 02:15:57.340
I'm still trying to decide between the two, and I would love to hear what you all think.

02:15:57.340 --> 02:16:00.660
Thanks for making my unbearable weekend commutes less horrible, Gemet.

02:16:00.660 --> 02:16:03.020
Wear pants with large pockets.

02:16:03.020 --> 02:16:05.420
No, 3DS.

02:16:05.420 --> 02:16:07.520
Yes, 2DS.

02:16:07.520 --> 02:16:09.100
If you have a man bag.

02:16:09.100 --> 02:16:10.100
That's true.

02:16:10.100 --> 02:16:11.100
If you have...

02:16:11.100 --> 02:16:12.100
Gemet probably does accessorize with a man purse.

02:16:12.100 --> 02:16:15.560
They do have cases for the 2DS.

02:16:15.560 --> 02:16:21.380
In all honesty, I still think the 3DS XL is the best system because the screens are still

02:16:21.380 --> 02:16:26.440
larger on an XL, and I might also be a little biased because I really want that freaking

02:16:26.440 --> 02:16:30.080
Zelda 3DS XL that's coming out.

02:16:30.080 --> 02:16:35.560
So I still think the XL is the best one of any of them, but the 2DS is not a bad alternative,

02:16:35.560 --> 02:16:37.200
and it is a much lower price.

02:16:37.200 --> 02:16:42.800
So you kind of have to just ask yourself, how much is A, a bigger screen, and B, 3D

02:16:42.800 --> 02:16:43.800
worth?

02:16:43.800 --> 02:16:47.040
Otherwise, functionally, they're really the same system.

02:16:47.040 --> 02:16:52.720
But if all you want to do is play Pokemon, then shit, get the 2DS.

02:16:52.720 --> 02:16:53.720
It doesn't really matter.

02:16:53.720 --> 02:16:58.400
But if you're thinking about the future, the 3D does really come in handy in some games

02:16:58.400 --> 02:17:00.480
like Super Mario 3D Land you're talking about.

02:17:00.480 --> 02:17:01.760
3D is really useful in that game.

02:17:01.760 --> 02:17:06.120
I use it actually on occasion in Animal Crossing, even though I can't keep the 3D on for very

02:17:06.120 --> 02:17:12.280
long, but I use it to catch flying bugs just because sometimes it's really hard to tell

02:17:12.280 --> 02:17:18.120
where they are in relation to where you are without the 3D.

02:17:18.120 --> 02:17:23.440
It also depends, I mean, even though I don't use the 3D, if I had a choice between the

02:17:23.440 --> 02:17:27.840
two, if someone was like, here, pick one, I'd still probably stick with the 3DS because

02:17:27.840 --> 02:17:30.460
I also like having it collapse.

02:17:30.460 --> 02:17:32.760
I like having it close.

02:17:32.760 --> 02:17:36.940
And that's always been something to like, because I actually adjust my screen level

02:17:36.940 --> 02:17:42.240
depending on if I'm sitting down and playing, if I happen to be in the car, which I don't

02:17:42.240 --> 02:17:44.580
really play that much in the car, but...

02:17:44.580 --> 02:17:47.880
You really do have to question some of the design choices around the 2DS.

02:17:47.880 --> 02:17:48.880
I mean, it feels...

02:17:48.880 --> 02:17:49.880
It's intended for kids.

02:17:49.880 --> 02:17:53.480
When it's in your hands, it feels nice, but yeah, just the whole fact it doesn't close

02:17:53.480 --> 02:17:54.480
is, I don't know.

02:17:54.480 --> 02:17:55.720
But I get the hinges right.

02:17:55.720 --> 02:17:57.120
You were moving parts.

02:17:57.120 --> 02:17:58.120
Yeah.

02:17:58.120 --> 02:18:01.720
Well, on top of that, you have wires running in the hinges too.

02:18:01.720 --> 02:18:03.040
It's just like with a regular laptop.

02:18:03.040 --> 02:18:04.040
Sure, sure.

02:18:04.040 --> 02:18:09.480
So you have a lot more room to make it completely unplayable as opposed to, you know, one full

02:18:09.480 --> 02:18:12.320
put together hard plastic piece.

02:18:12.320 --> 02:18:16.720
So honestly, Gemit, you kind of just have to ask yourself, like, how much is it worth?

02:18:16.720 --> 02:18:21.240
Like, am I willing to pay that extra money to have the larger screens and have it close

02:18:21.240 --> 02:18:22.240
up?

02:18:22.240 --> 02:18:24.320
And if that's really not a big deal to you and there's really only the one game you want

02:18:24.320 --> 02:18:26.160
to play on it, then fuck it, get a 2DS.

02:18:26.160 --> 02:18:27.160
Why not?

02:18:27.160 --> 02:18:30.640
By the way, Gemit says it's a messenger bag.

02:18:30.640 --> 02:18:34.440
Wait for a bundle with a design that you really, really like and then buy that whatever it

02:18:34.440 --> 02:18:35.680
is, 2D or 3D.

02:18:35.680 --> 02:18:39.040
There is a Pokemon 3DS XL for what it's worth, red and blue one.

02:18:39.040 --> 02:18:41.560
Or have wonderful, wonderful friends like Slidekick.

02:18:41.560 --> 02:18:43.560
There you go.

02:18:43.560 --> 02:18:44.560
Thank you so much.

02:18:44.560 --> 02:18:46.520
That's the only reason I have a 3DS.

02:18:46.520 --> 02:18:47.520
Thank you for feeding my addiction.

02:18:47.520 --> 02:18:48.520
I love you.

02:18:48.520 --> 02:18:49.520
What a nice boy.

02:18:49.520 --> 02:18:50.520
Yes.

02:18:50.520 --> 02:18:51.520
You get cookies.

02:18:51.520 --> 02:18:52.520
Hey, OLR.

02:18:52.520 --> 02:18:56.280
Before I go into the meat of my email, I thought I'd update my situation with Gamerscape.

02:18:56.280 --> 02:18:58.160
This is Rossdale, UT.

02:18:58.160 --> 02:19:02.040
I tried to file a complaint against them with the BBB, but they didn't seem to have a site

02:19:02.040 --> 02:19:06.760
listed in their business and I couldn't find the address or the like, which seems to be

02:19:06.760 --> 02:19:10.960
required when submitting a complaint about a business the BBB is unaware of.

02:19:10.960 --> 02:19:15.600
All I could get is that they're in Stockholm, Sweden, and I'm not going to burn a charge

02:19:15.600 --> 02:19:16.680
back over $10.

02:19:16.680 --> 02:19:19.160
I'm not sure what, if anything, I can do about this.

02:19:19.160 --> 02:19:23.360
I'm probably just out of luck and left telling anyone who will listen to avoid that piss

02:19:23.360 --> 02:19:25.360
hole of a site.

02:19:25.360 --> 02:19:27.800
You're using opinions expressed by the emailer.

02:19:27.800 --> 02:19:28.800
You're not necessarily...

02:19:28.800 --> 02:19:29.800
Well...

02:19:29.800 --> 02:19:30.800
I don't know this site at all.

02:19:30.800 --> 02:19:36.280
But there are businesses that do keep foreign addresses to precisely not have to answer.

02:19:36.800 --> 02:19:42.200
Good on him for following up and putting his angry pen where his mouth is, so to speak.

02:19:42.200 --> 02:19:43.200
Well, no.

02:19:43.200 --> 02:19:48.680
You know, what was the thing that I used to quote from some study that I did in customer

02:19:48.680 --> 02:19:50.120
service actually?

02:19:50.120 --> 02:19:56.280
That out of every eight people with a complaint, only one will be an advocate.

02:19:56.280 --> 02:19:58.040
That means only one person will do something about it.

02:19:58.040 --> 02:20:00.760
So thank you for being an advocate.

02:20:00.760 --> 02:20:04.520
Anyway, enough of those cancers on gaming.

02:20:04.520 --> 02:20:05.520
Wow.

02:20:05.760 --> 02:20:08.600
Someone asked me if I considered Desura my happy alternative.

02:20:08.600 --> 02:20:12.400
Unlike many, I don't have a real preference when it comes to services other than they

02:20:12.400 --> 02:20:14.160
offer DRM free games.

02:20:14.160 --> 02:20:20.040
Desura is DRM agnostic, meaning they'll put games that publishers are absolutely adamant

02:20:20.040 --> 02:20:21.040
about DRM.

02:20:21.040 --> 02:20:25.180
However, they do make sure to let you know that if you're getting a game that needs DRM,

02:20:25.180 --> 02:20:26.340
so I know what to avoid.

02:20:26.340 --> 02:20:30.500
I just wish I could filter out DRM titles in search.

02:20:30.500 --> 02:20:35.460
Other sites I use are Indie Game Stand, GOG, and Humble Bundle.

02:20:35.460 --> 02:20:38.740
Also I've just recently discovered that if a site is selling their game with the Humble

02:20:38.740 --> 02:20:43.520
widget, it can be linked to your Humble Bundle account, which greatly expands my options.

02:20:43.520 --> 02:20:47.900
I found a place called Bundle in a Box, and I haven't known of them long enough to see

02:20:47.900 --> 02:20:50.700
a bundle I want from them, but I'll get back to you on that.

02:20:50.700 --> 02:20:56.340
I've also looked at Dotemu, which seems to be a GOG-like service, so I'll be giving them

02:20:56.340 --> 02:20:57.340
a try when I can.

02:20:57.340 --> 02:21:00.380
Basically, I'll go wherever to get my PC games DRM free.

02:21:00.380 --> 02:21:01.940
So that's my answer to Rob's question.

02:21:01.940 --> 02:21:04.660
Anyway, I hope you guys don't mind my whining.

02:21:04.860 --> 02:21:07.340
I like that he had an answer to the question, so thank you.

02:21:07.340 --> 02:21:14.340
To go back to the whole Gamersgate thing, if you do a Whois search on them, just type

02:21:14.340 --> 02:21:19.940
Whois in Google, type in their URL when it pops up on the GoDaddy site, it'll give you

02:21:19.940 --> 02:21:22.060
their address right there.

02:21:22.060 --> 02:21:27.740
But as he said, Stockholm, Sweden, the actual company's name is apparently Paradox Interactive

02:21:27.740 --> 02:21:29.060
AB.

02:21:29.060 --> 02:21:32.900
There's also Lupia AB, and various other things.

02:21:32.900 --> 02:21:35.620
But yeah, definitely registered overseas.

02:21:35.620 --> 02:21:37.740
Someone out of BBB reach.

02:21:37.740 --> 02:21:43.380
Also, PS, when are you going to include the forums in your Frugal Question of the Week?

02:21:43.380 --> 02:21:46.620
I, for one, don't like social media networks.

02:21:46.620 --> 02:21:51.060
That's a fair question, but honestly, our forums have not been very active at vognetwork.com,

02:21:51.060 --> 02:21:54.820
and I just kind of think, I don't know, I wonder if maybe forums in general just aren't

02:21:54.820 --> 02:21:57.220
really a thing these days.

02:21:57.220 --> 02:21:59.780
What in general would get people to participate more in the forums?

02:21:59.780 --> 02:22:02.180
Change it to a BBS.

02:22:03.180 --> 02:22:08.060
I am all for setting up a vognetwork BBS, where we could play games like Legend of the

02:22:08.060 --> 02:22:09.060
Red Dragon.

02:22:09.060 --> 02:22:12.420
Actually, I would so be down for that, that would be awesome, but that has nothing to

02:22:12.420 --> 02:22:16.940
do with a frickin' PHP BB, so I don't know.

02:22:16.940 --> 02:22:21.020
I mean, I guess the obvious answer is, well, Rob, try posting that on the forums and see

02:22:21.020 --> 02:22:22.020
what happens.

02:22:22.020 --> 02:22:23.020
Or...

02:22:23.020 --> 02:22:27.180
I'm also going to be honest, most of the questions I think of the day of the show, and a large

02:22:27.180 --> 02:22:31.160
part of that is that we don't always know all the news until the day of the show.

02:22:31.160 --> 02:22:34.120
So you wouldn't have a lot of time, and that's one concern I have.

02:22:34.120 --> 02:22:39.640
And Facebook and Google, whether you love them or hate them, are always very immediate.

02:22:39.640 --> 02:22:43.640
You see, you know, people check their news feed all the time and so forth, so that's

02:22:43.640 --> 02:22:45.200
what makes it attractive.

02:22:45.200 --> 02:22:49.760
However, as a suggestion, and I myself am doing something similar, if you happen to

02:22:49.760 --> 02:22:55.760
see something from a Frugal Question of the Week, and you feel would make a good personal

02:22:55.760 --> 02:22:58.400
editorial, why not try to submit some content?

02:22:58.400 --> 02:22:59.400
Oh yeah.

02:22:59.640 --> 02:23:02.920
You know, send us an article if you have something to say about something that's been a Frugal

02:23:02.920 --> 02:23:03.920
Question.

02:23:03.920 --> 02:23:08.800
And, you know, assuming it's not full of, you know, accusing too many people or companies

02:23:08.800 --> 02:23:13.000
of being cancers on gaming, we might publish it.

02:23:13.000 --> 02:23:18.840
You know, we do want a little bit more diplomacy in things on our site.

02:23:18.840 --> 02:23:20.200
And Black Wolf does have a good point.

02:23:20.200 --> 02:23:21.840
You get more than enough answers anyway.

02:23:21.840 --> 02:23:24.000
Like tonight, we just had too many answers to read.

02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:28.840
I'd still be reading them right now, which, don't get me wrong, love you guys for participating,

02:23:28.840 --> 02:23:32.800
but you know, part of it is too that I want everybody to be able to go read all the answers

02:23:32.800 --> 02:23:35.840
themselves and just hear me rattle them off.

02:23:35.840 --> 02:23:37.400
And three hour show.

02:23:37.400 --> 02:23:38.400
Yes.

02:23:38.400 --> 02:23:39.400
A three hour show.

02:23:39.400 --> 02:23:40.400
Sometimes four.

02:23:40.400 --> 02:23:41.800
A three hour show with news and not.

02:23:41.800 --> 02:23:42.800
I don't know, Jason.

02:23:42.800 --> 02:23:43.800
8.30, 8.35.

02:23:43.800 --> 02:23:48.560
Tonight was, I don't know if you guys, we cut out, there's three less stories tonight

02:23:48.560 --> 02:23:51.800
because it's such a slow news week, but we filled it other ways.

02:23:51.800 --> 02:23:52.800
We're chatty.

02:23:52.800 --> 02:23:53.800
We're chatty people.

02:23:53.800 --> 02:23:54.800
Well, we do have more email.

02:23:54.800 --> 02:23:55.800
Yay.

02:23:55.800 --> 02:23:56.800
Speaking of chatting.

02:23:56.800 --> 02:23:57.800
Hey guys.

02:23:57.800 --> 02:23:58.800
Hey.

02:23:58.800 --> 02:24:00.800
I don't look like a guy.

02:24:00.800 --> 02:24:01.800
Anyway.

02:24:01.800 --> 02:24:05.700
I've been listening to Hohler for the past few months every Monday morning at my new

02:24:05.700 --> 02:24:06.700
grad job.

02:24:06.700 --> 02:24:07.700
Congrats.

02:24:07.700 --> 02:24:11.720
I unfortunately cannot join in the live stream often due to being on the east coast.

02:24:11.720 --> 02:24:15.400
After listening to this week's podcast with the section on crowdfunded games, I was wondering

02:24:15.400 --> 02:24:17.560
if you guys have looked at Star Citizen.

02:24:17.560 --> 02:24:22.720
It's a new MMO space sim coming out from Chris Roberts and as of this email, it has raised

02:24:22.720 --> 02:24:25.720
over 24 million through pure crowdfunding.

02:24:25.720 --> 02:24:28.760
The game looks like it's going to be amazing and has a ton of backers.

02:24:28.760 --> 02:24:34.280
Chris Roberts is looking to make a PC game to push the PC to its limit.

02:24:34.280 --> 02:24:37.860
Check it out at robertspaceindustries.com.

02:24:37.860 --> 02:24:40.860
So that's robertspaceindustries.com.

02:24:40.860 --> 02:24:46.000
Anyway, thanks for the podcast and I hope to be able to join the live stream at some

02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:47.000
point soon.

02:24:47.000 --> 02:24:48.000
Duron.

02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:49.000
Oh, I saw that name in chat tonight.

02:24:49.000 --> 02:24:50.000
So.

02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:51.000
Hi Duron.

02:24:51.000 --> 02:24:52.000
I'm glad you're here.

02:24:52.000 --> 02:24:53.000
And I'm sorry for being disgusting in part A.

02:24:53.000 --> 02:24:56.720
Like I said, I was channeling extrovert.

02:24:56.720 --> 02:24:57.720
You're apologizing.

02:24:57.720 --> 02:25:00.920
Uh, now, uh, I, I, I'm not apologizing.

02:25:00.920 --> 02:25:01.920
Am I kidding?

02:25:01.920 --> 02:25:04.760
I did not recognize the game that was being discussed there, but Jason, you raised your

02:25:04.760 --> 02:25:05.760
hand.

02:25:05.760 --> 02:25:06.760
You were like, yes, yes.

02:25:06.760 --> 02:25:07.760
I did.

02:25:07.760 --> 02:25:13.940
I adore this game because wing commander is one of the few dogfights in space or air.

02:25:13.940 --> 02:25:16.120
That's been absolute one of my absolute favorite series.

02:25:16.120 --> 02:25:18.120
Um, for the most part.

02:25:18.120 --> 02:25:24.280
Um, but Chris Roberts is, you know, every, everybody has, everybody has a one specific

02:25:24.280 --> 02:25:28.200
individual that a game or a company or somebody is known for in large part.

02:25:28.200 --> 02:25:31.640
And Chris Roberts is the guy for, uh, wing commander.

02:25:31.640 --> 02:25:35.800
And so he's creating a space dogfight MMO.

02:25:35.800 --> 02:25:37.280
No MMO has grabbed me so far.

02:25:37.280 --> 02:25:45.080
I played, um, both Final Fantasy 11 and WoW to like level eight or nine on my characters.

02:25:45.080 --> 02:25:48.120
A couple of days worth of playing never really went beyond that.

02:25:48.120 --> 02:25:54.000
Um, but you know, MMOs have involved, have evolved in insane amount since even, since

02:25:54.000 --> 02:26:00.340
even WoW came out, um, it's supposed to be full real time space dog fighting with the

02:26:00.340 --> 02:26:03.120
addition of ships that you can dock on planets.

02:26:03.120 --> 02:26:06.840
You can land on jump gates to go between galaxies.

02:26:06.840 --> 02:26:12.520
One of the concepts that was the most interesting to me is that you won't just, it not only

02:26:12.520 --> 02:26:15.780
is that they're going to make a universe, but the universe is going to continue to grow.

02:26:15.780 --> 02:26:17.320
It's not going to be this finite thing.

02:26:17.320 --> 02:26:22.680
There will be additional land, um, universes that you can discover planets that you can

02:26:22.680 --> 02:26:23.740
travel to.

02:26:23.740 --> 02:26:29.160
You can play the game passively and be a merchant commander still has a military intent, but

02:26:29.160 --> 02:26:31.800
you can be like a merchant and do passive things.

02:26:31.800 --> 02:26:38.640
Or you can be, uh, you know, a pirate or Confederate Raider to go in and do things for your faction.

02:26:38.640 --> 02:26:40.560
It sounds expansive.

02:26:40.560 --> 02:26:41.840
It sounds gripping.

02:26:41.840 --> 02:26:48.880
Um, there were murmurs about Oculus support, which would be unbelievable in a 3d, you know,

02:26:48.880 --> 02:26:52.640
3d universe of a game when you have, you know, all your controls in front of you in a form

02:26:52.640 --> 02:26:56.880
of a joystick and however much rudder or anything, throttle, anything else that you have.

02:26:56.880 --> 02:26:58.720
Um, it has sounded amazing.

02:26:58.720 --> 02:27:00.680
I am a backer.

02:27:00.680 --> 02:27:04.040
It's what the, the, the shirt that I got is actually one of the most comfortable shirts

02:27:04.040 --> 02:27:06.080
I own right now, which is very interesting.

02:27:06.080 --> 02:27:10.480
Um, but I have my, I have my badge, my ID tag.

02:27:10.480 --> 02:27:13.480
Um, yeah, it's, it's looked absolutely phenomenal.

02:27:13.480 --> 02:27:14.480
Hmm.

02:27:14.480 --> 02:27:16.600
Or at least sometime 2014, sorry.

02:27:16.600 --> 02:27:22.160
Dungeon buster said in a chat Roberts also did freelancer when he had digital anvil and

02:27:22.160 --> 02:27:26.400
players essentially turned into a mini MMO with a number of mods added to it over the

02:27:26.400 --> 02:27:30.920
years and Duran just said Oculus support is confirmed.

02:27:30.920 --> 02:27:31.920
Nice.

02:27:31.920 --> 02:27:32.920
Tim Tripp.

02:27:32.920 --> 02:27:33.920
It sounds like Eve without the spreadsheets.

02:27:33.920 --> 02:27:34.920
Yes.

02:27:34.920 --> 02:27:35.920
That is 100% correct.

02:27:36.760 --> 02:27:39.520
Uh, looking at some other comments in chat real quick, uh, on star citizen, Tim Tripp

02:27:39.520 --> 02:27:44.040
says a star citizen is the only game I've ever crowdsourced and dungeon buster says

02:27:44.040 --> 02:27:46.020
star citizen still on the fence with that one.

02:27:46.020 --> 02:27:48.040
Not too keen on the MMO elements.

02:27:48.040 --> 02:27:49.400
There you go.

02:27:49.400 --> 02:27:51.400
I am moving for back into the email land.

02:27:51.400 --> 02:27:53.400
We have three.

02:27:53.400 --> 02:27:58.720
Hi, OLR had a fleeting thought the other day about how video games are constantly compared

02:27:58.720 --> 02:28:02.440
to movies as they seem to be aligning more and more in terms of narrative and visual

02:28:02.440 --> 02:28:03.440
fidelity.

02:28:03.440 --> 02:28:05.440
Thank you for using fidelity in an email.

02:28:05.960 --> 02:28:08.160
That makes me feel, have a little hope.

02:28:08.160 --> 02:28:11.680
And there is a point of differentiation that I found interesting.

02:28:11.680 --> 02:28:16.860
If a movie is considered a critical and commercial success, it's typically given many sequels.

02:28:16.860 --> 02:28:21.480
With this, the original film seems more often than not become viewed as superior and pure

02:28:21.480 --> 02:28:23.620
version of the franchise as a whole.

02:28:23.620 --> 02:28:27.520
Why is this not the same with video games that they're so closely connected to films?

02:28:27.520 --> 02:28:31.160
When a video game enjoys mass success, it is given a sequel and almost instantly original

02:28:31.160 --> 02:28:35.240
game is rendered obsolete due to the improved build of the game engine, better graphics

02:28:35.240 --> 02:28:36.440
control, et cetera.

02:28:36.440 --> 02:28:37.840
Curious to know your thoughts on this.

02:28:37.840 --> 02:28:40.880
I'm going to put in right now, I'm going to use Mass Effect as my thing, so don't judge

02:28:40.880 --> 02:28:41.880
me.

02:28:41.880 --> 02:28:42.880
Okay.

02:28:42.880 --> 02:28:46.480
First, Mass Effect, better story wise than the later two.

02:28:46.480 --> 02:28:47.480
Really?

02:28:47.480 --> 02:28:50.200
I don't agree with that, but okay.

02:28:50.200 --> 02:28:54.500
I think that it was when you're introducing different writing teams and the story changes

02:28:54.500 --> 02:28:57.560
dramatically from the direction it was going in.

02:28:57.560 --> 02:29:01.360
That's when I have some concerns.

02:29:01.360 --> 02:29:06.160
But as far as playing the game, Mass Effect 3 is lots of fun.

02:29:06.160 --> 02:29:11.840
I have way much more fun actually just playing the game than I do the first Mass Effect,

02:29:11.840 --> 02:29:13.600
especially since the Mako makes me want to puke.

02:29:13.600 --> 02:29:17.760
So if I'm understanding the question right, they want to know when the original is better

02:29:17.760 --> 02:29:19.200
than the sequel.

02:29:19.200 --> 02:29:24.280
Because in movies, it tends to be that the original is better than the sequel, right?

02:29:24.280 --> 02:29:27.520
Very rarely are sequels as good as the original, unless you're talking about like, you know,

02:29:27.520 --> 02:29:32.960
I don't know, like the Godfather, you know, Star Wars, yeah, well, Star Wars and so on.

02:29:32.960 --> 02:29:37.840
A lot of times too, that when you have a movie come out, typically sequels are done, I mean,

02:29:37.840 --> 02:29:42.580
except for when they're planned as trilogies, for example, Star Wars, the only three in

02:29:42.580 --> 02:29:47.660
existence in my brain, in my universe, head canon.

02:29:47.660 --> 02:29:52.220
Those tell a good story and they're a cohesive unit.

02:29:52.340 --> 02:29:55.860
The real bill was intended to be a full movie, right?

02:29:55.860 --> 02:30:00.300
And the two parts are different enough, but they are a cohesive story.

02:30:00.300 --> 02:30:04.740
When you have sequels that are made as cash cows, you know, Oh, well, this movie did good.

02:30:04.740 --> 02:30:07.700
Let's see if we can make some more money, hangover part two and three.

02:30:07.700 --> 02:30:08.700
Yeah.

02:30:08.700 --> 02:30:09.700
Right.

02:30:09.700 --> 02:30:13.420
But, you know, I think like one of the few movies that have actually done that successfully

02:30:13.420 --> 02:30:18.980
is like the American Pie series, those have all been kind of funny in their own bizarre

02:30:18.980 --> 02:30:20.180
scream movies.

02:30:20.180 --> 02:30:23.620
Not everybody likes the sequels as much as I do, but have you actually seen all of the

02:30:23.620 --> 02:30:24.620
American Pies?

02:30:24.620 --> 02:30:27.180
I've seen two and part of three.

02:30:27.180 --> 02:30:31.100
Some of the direct to video ones are awful though.

02:30:31.100 --> 02:30:32.100
Let's be real.

02:30:32.100 --> 02:30:33.100
Just saying they exist.

02:30:33.100 --> 02:30:35.140
Anyway, I did want to watch the band camp.

02:30:35.140 --> 02:30:39.580
Let's go back to dude's question because, um, it's, or it could be female.

02:30:39.580 --> 02:30:44.140
I didn't, sorry, but I don't know who, I don't know based on names, if y'all are male or

02:30:44.140 --> 02:30:47.020
female, it's, it's a traditionally masculine name, but it could go the other way.

02:30:47.020 --> 02:30:48.020
You never know.

02:30:48.060 --> 02:30:53.740
Um, so what the emailer, um, said there, I think the question really was, have you played

02:30:53.740 --> 02:30:59.740
a video game where the sequel was not as good as the original and this is, I almost used

02:30:59.740 --> 02:31:01.240
this as the kickoff topic tonight.

02:31:01.240 --> 02:31:04.620
The other one was a little more themed for Halloween, which, you know, but I thought

02:31:04.620 --> 02:31:05.620
this is a great question too.

02:31:05.620 --> 02:31:08.540
I was hoping I could hear from the three of you if there are any game series you can think

02:31:08.540 --> 02:31:12.860
of where you consider the first game to be superior version despite multiple sequels.

02:31:12.860 --> 02:31:17.940
Yes, I have a, uh, I had to really think about this, but I have a great answer I think for

02:31:17.940 --> 02:31:18.940
this.

02:31:18.940 --> 02:31:24.100
Uh, I have to go retro, really retro, but Blaster Master, the original, well, the original

02:31:24.100 --> 02:31:26.860
was superior to anything that came out after it.

02:31:26.860 --> 02:31:28.340
Like that horrible Genesis one.

02:31:28.340 --> 02:31:30.100
But it had a better Japanese game.

02:31:30.100 --> 02:31:31.660
Was it Space Fight Hyperion?

02:31:31.660 --> 02:31:35.180
Yeah, but I, I, but Blaster Master was the answer that came to my mind.

02:31:35.180 --> 02:31:38.300
I don't know if you guys, I had more time to think about it, but you guys.

02:31:38.300 --> 02:31:39.300
Excite Truck.

02:31:39.300 --> 02:31:42.100
You're on that kick again.

02:31:42.100 --> 02:31:44.940
Tim Tripp actually makes a good point and this is something I was going to bring up

02:31:44.940 --> 02:31:45.940
as well.

02:31:45.980 --> 02:31:50.500
Typically the first game in a new IP doesn't receive the budget that an established IP.

02:31:50.500 --> 02:31:54.180
So the big difference that comes in the amount of risk inherent in creating a new IP versus

02:31:54.180 --> 02:31:55.780
a new movie IP.

02:31:55.780 --> 02:32:01.140
Uh, I think that is a great point and I think it's very true with games, but to be fair,

02:32:01.140 --> 02:32:05.420
it's also true to some extent with movies and I would point out those movies that they've

02:32:05.420 --> 02:32:10.260
made a million of like, um, Saw, as much as I hate those movies, there's that, right?

02:32:10.260 --> 02:32:15.540
And then there's, um, but, but, but, or sorry, Paranormal Activity.

02:32:15.540 --> 02:32:17.940
You know, the first one was made for like what, a quarter?

02:32:17.940 --> 02:32:21.000
Like they smashed some kid's piggy bank and made a movie with the money that was in it.

02:32:21.000 --> 02:32:24.180
But then the others got like more and more budgets later on.

02:32:24.180 --> 02:32:27.900
But I, but just, you know, the saw, I get a saw though, they actually do have a story

02:32:27.900 --> 02:32:30.900
that goes through the whole thing, apparently, although I haven't seen the last movie, but

02:32:30.900 --> 02:32:31.900
I read the Wiki.

02:32:31.900 --> 02:32:34.700
I saw them all, but they actually do have a story.

02:32:34.700 --> 02:32:38.100
Like once you watch them like, Oh, Hey, there actually is something that kind of ties in

02:32:38.100 --> 02:32:39.100
with all this stuff.

02:32:39.100 --> 02:32:40.260
I think it's one of those things.

02:32:40.260 --> 02:32:42.580
Again, I only read it off the Wiki afterwards.

02:32:42.580 --> 02:32:43.580
Yeah.

02:32:43.620 --> 02:32:47.140
I only read the Wiki cause I refuse to watch the movies after I saw the first one and that

02:32:47.140 --> 02:32:48.140
was enough.

02:32:48.140 --> 02:32:50.700
Just to tell you, Shayne, I actually like Dragon Age 2 better than the first one.

02:32:50.700 --> 02:32:51.940
So far, so far.

02:32:51.940 --> 02:32:58.660
Oh, that's a good answer though, to the question, Dragon Age, um, the, the, I did see Saw 1

02:32:58.660 --> 02:32:59.660
for whoever asked in chat.

02:32:59.660 --> 02:33:01.860
I saw Saw 1, I refuse to watch any of the others.

02:33:01.860 --> 02:33:05.320
I have a feeling that they always knew how it was going to end.

02:33:05.320 --> 02:33:07.620
And I think they, they tied it together that way.

02:33:07.620 --> 02:33:09.300
They always knew how it was going to end.

02:33:09.660 --> 02:33:13.620
You know, there's a, and actually I thought about it, but someone in chat mentioned it

02:33:13.620 --> 02:33:14.620
too.

02:33:14.620 --> 02:33:16.220
Um, Android, is that Alan?

02:33:16.220 --> 02:33:17.460
It's Alan on his phone.

02:33:17.460 --> 02:33:18.460
He's on light rail right now.

02:33:18.460 --> 02:33:20.980
Devil May Cry.

02:33:20.980 --> 02:33:22.460
The first one was better.

02:33:22.460 --> 02:33:24.540
In my opinion, I liked it a lot better.

02:33:24.540 --> 02:33:29.060
Um, I can, I am also tempted to say Silent Hill.

02:33:29.060 --> 02:33:33.380
I think in some ways the first game is superior to anything that came after it.

02:33:33.380 --> 02:33:35.420
It's limitations actually made it creepier.

02:33:35.460 --> 02:33:40.580
However, Silent Hill 2 is kind of the, the climax of that whole series.

02:33:40.580 --> 02:33:43.660
And that was, I mean, yes, that's a sequel, but how many Silent Hills have there been

02:33:43.660 --> 02:33:44.660
after that?

02:33:44.660 --> 02:33:45.660
Too many.

02:33:45.660 --> 02:33:46.660
Oh, no, no.

02:33:46.660 --> 02:33:48.100
There've only been a few Silent Hill games.

02:33:48.100 --> 02:33:49.100
The others are fakes.

02:33:49.100 --> 02:33:50.100
Yeah.

02:33:50.100 --> 02:33:51.100
Anyway.

02:33:51.100 --> 02:33:52.500
They don't exist in my, in my universe.

02:33:52.500 --> 02:33:53.740
That was a fantastic question.

02:33:53.740 --> 02:33:58.380
I would actually invite, um, if, uh, you know, we do comments on this show every week at

02:33:58.380 --> 02:34:04.060
vognetwork.com and I'd really invite you if you want to leave a comment and if your answer's

02:34:04.060 --> 02:34:07.780
good, I will get, or like, you know, of course, Shane pipes in.

02:34:07.780 --> 02:34:11.380
I'll be very easy on you with this, but, um, I'll give you a thumbs up guaranteed.

02:34:11.380 --> 02:34:14.500
So you get a little point on vognetwork.com.

02:34:14.500 --> 02:34:17.940
If you have an answer to this question, leave it on the episode posting at vognetwork.com

02:34:17.940 --> 02:34:18.940
for you podcast listeners.

02:34:18.940 --> 02:34:23.660
Cause I want to know what games do you believe had better initial games than the sequels?

02:34:23.660 --> 02:34:27.500
See Shane ranks the Silent Hill games as two, four, one, three.

02:34:27.500 --> 02:34:28.500
I beg to differ.

02:34:28.500 --> 02:34:29.500
Hmm.

02:34:29.500 --> 02:34:30.500
Three, two, four, one.

02:34:30.500 --> 02:34:31.500
Now take that.

02:34:31.500 --> 02:34:32.500
Three, two, one, four.

02:34:32.900 --> 02:34:38.900
Shane, Shane, admittedly, you value the room way more than a lot of people do.

02:34:38.900 --> 02:34:40.740
The room wasn't supposed to be a Silent Hill game.

02:34:40.740 --> 02:34:41.740
Oh, remember?

02:34:41.740 --> 02:34:42.740
Anyway.

02:34:42.740 --> 02:34:46.020
I loved the, I liked the room, the three booths that they had for that game.

02:34:46.020 --> 02:34:47.020
Yeah.

02:34:47.020 --> 02:34:48.340
That was my first, like the kitchen and everything.

02:34:48.340 --> 02:34:49.340
Oh my God.

02:34:49.340 --> 02:34:50.340
That was awesome.

02:34:50.340 --> 02:34:52.940
So, um, yeah, we still have more email.

02:34:52.940 --> 02:34:53.940
Yay.

02:34:53.940 --> 02:34:56.020
This is, we didn't need three extra stories.

02:34:56.020 --> 02:34:57.980
We've got three extra emails tonight and that's fine.

02:34:57.980 --> 02:34:58.980
Every gamer gets a voice.

02:34:58.980 --> 02:34:59.980
Hey guys.

02:34:59.980 --> 02:35:00.980
Hey guys.

02:35:00.980 --> 02:35:01.980
Starlock here.

02:35:01.980 --> 02:35:02.980
Hi Starlock.

02:35:02.980 --> 02:35:08.740
With Halloween mere days away, I had a question to pose to both the host and listeners.

02:35:08.740 --> 02:35:13.180
I wanted to know what game you can't finish due to one scene that spoils the rest of the

02:35:13.180 --> 02:35:14.180
game for you.

02:35:14.180 --> 02:35:17.500
I'll give you my example near the beginning of Homefront.

02:35:17.500 --> 02:35:20.500
There's a scene in which the child's parents are killed right in front of him and the child

02:35:20.500 --> 02:35:22.620
is seen crying for several seconds.

02:35:22.620 --> 02:35:26.700
Even though I'm fairly certain no other such scenes exist in the game, it completely kills

02:35:26.700 --> 02:35:30.540
the desire for me to see the rest of the game because that scene is just too disturbing

02:35:30.540 --> 02:35:31.620
for me to watch.

02:35:31.620 --> 02:35:35.380
I wanted to know if anyone else had similar experiences with any games out there.

02:35:35.380 --> 02:35:36.380
Keep being awesome, Starlock.

02:35:36.380 --> 02:35:38.460
There's a movie that does that for me.

02:35:38.460 --> 02:35:41.260
I can't watch Face Off.

02:35:41.260 --> 02:35:45.620
I never played more than Silent, than the start of Silent Hill 4 because the opening

02:35:45.620 --> 02:35:50.140
cinematic and the ambience just kind of completely creeped me out.

02:35:50.140 --> 02:35:54.140
I think my head was just kind of in a weird place that afternoon and I think I literally

02:35:54.140 --> 02:35:58.540
just finished Silent Hill 3 and moved on to Silent Hill 4, but I saw the opening cinematic

02:35:58.540 --> 02:36:01.340
which did the whole world shifting.

02:36:01.340 --> 02:36:05.580
I did start the game, I did get control, I went to the window and I looked outside and

02:36:05.580 --> 02:36:11.140
saw the other apartment across the way, whatever, but I never touched the game beyond that because

02:36:11.140 --> 02:36:17.900
for whatever reason the ambience just seemed too much for my brain and I put it down and

02:36:17.900 --> 02:36:21.540
never picked it back up again.

02:36:21.540 --> 02:36:25.300
If my name was Bobby Blackwell, I might say, well, I played the demo to Ni No Kuni and

02:36:25.300 --> 02:36:29.740
then that scared me off for the rest of the game.

02:36:29.740 --> 02:36:33.100
I can only think of a funny answer because I can't think of a serious one because I didn't

02:36:33.100 --> 02:36:34.100
see this email in advance.

02:36:34.100 --> 02:36:36.660
It must have come in late.

02:36:36.660 --> 02:36:37.660
I really don't know.

02:36:37.660 --> 02:36:38.660
A game where a scene...

02:36:38.660 --> 02:36:41.180
Does it have to be disturbing or just it was bad?

02:36:41.180 --> 02:36:43.540
Like there was something so bad happen?

02:36:43.540 --> 02:36:44.540
Question.

02:36:44.540 --> 02:36:47.460
Well, disturbing, bad, something that affected you in a way that made you not want to finish

02:36:47.460 --> 02:36:50.900
it.

02:36:50.900 --> 02:36:54.540
It's like me in the scene in legend that I can't get past and have never finished the

02:36:54.540 --> 02:36:55.540
movie.

02:36:55.540 --> 02:36:56.540
Oh yeah.

02:36:56.540 --> 02:36:57.540
You know what I'm talking about?

02:36:57.540 --> 02:36:58.540
Yeah, I know I do.

02:36:58.540 --> 02:37:03.120
And I'm trying to think if I have anything that's kind of like trigger-ish like that.

02:37:03.120 --> 02:37:05.580
And for the record, I don't think I could play the game for exactly the same reason

02:37:05.580 --> 02:37:08.820
because it's kind of a very horrible thing for me.

02:37:08.820 --> 02:37:09.900
I can't think of something.

02:37:09.900 --> 02:37:13.780
If I think of something, I'll have to answer it on VOG Network or something because I really

02:37:13.780 --> 02:37:14.780
can't think of anything.

02:37:14.780 --> 02:37:17.240
Loki, can you think of anything that...

02:37:17.240 --> 02:37:19.960
When you put in the Excitebots and found it wasn't it's like track?

02:37:19.960 --> 02:37:27.480
Yeah, it was the first Mexico track and you're playing it and then the game asks you to throw

02:37:27.480 --> 02:37:28.640
a pie at a clown.

02:37:28.640 --> 02:37:32.680
I was like, what the fuck is this?

02:37:32.680 --> 02:37:35.960
I can't think of anything that's really had a scene in the game that kind of ruined it

02:37:35.960 --> 02:37:36.960
for me.

02:37:36.960 --> 02:37:43.800
I can think of a lot of games where you play through it and the end is like kind of lame.

02:37:43.800 --> 02:37:45.200
And that kind of ruined it for me.

02:37:45.200 --> 02:37:47.040
It's like, shit, why did I play this game?

02:37:47.040 --> 02:37:49.800
This ending is fucking terrible.

02:37:49.800 --> 02:37:53.000
But no, I can't think of anything that's like there's been something in the middle of the

02:37:53.000 --> 02:37:56.520
game, like a story thing where it just kind of went, what?

02:37:56.520 --> 02:37:57.720
I don't like this.

02:37:57.720 --> 02:38:01.160
I'm going to quit this game.

02:38:01.160 --> 02:38:03.940
Tim Tripp in chat says, I watched The Descent once.

02:38:03.940 --> 02:38:07.040
It was amazing, but I can never watch it again.

02:38:07.040 --> 02:38:10.800
I've definitely seen a lot of movies like that where it's like, I'm glad I saw it once

02:38:10.800 --> 02:38:12.440
and I will never watch that again.

02:38:12.440 --> 02:38:15.580
I have a movie I can say I wasn't glad that I saw it even though I didn't have to pay

02:38:15.580 --> 02:38:16.580
for it.

02:38:16.620 --> 02:38:17.620
And that was Drag Me to Hell.

02:38:17.620 --> 02:38:19.420
I went with Tiara to see it.

02:38:19.420 --> 02:38:20.420
She loved it.

02:38:20.420 --> 02:38:23.020
I just thought it was gross and not very good.

02:38:23.020 --> 02:38:24.900
Watched movie 43 the other day.

02:38:24.900 --> 02:38:29.180
Very disappointed that that movie was not funny or it wasn't as.

02:38:29.180 --> 02:38:31.980
They showed you all the funny stuff in the trailer.

02:38:31.980 --> 02:38:36.980
It did have a cameo, though, of Band Fuse, a game that will unfortunately sorely fail

02:38:36.980 --> 02:38:40.380
when it comes out in November, but it had a cameo.

02:38:40.380 --> 02:38:42.380
So there's a bullet point for that.

02:38:42.380 --> 02:38:44.660
I'm trying to see if the chatters have any.

02:38:44.660 --> 02:38:46.420
They're still doing the Silent Hill debate in chat.

02:38:46.420 --> 02:38:49.940
There's not a lot of comments on it, but Dungeon Buster does say I couldn't get past

02:38:49.940 --> 02:38:52.940
the bad full motion video acting in a PC game once.

02:38:52.940 --> 02:38:55.940
Well, the gameplay was also pretty terrible, too, but he didn't say what game it was.

02:38:55.940 --> 02:38:57.980
So I don't know.

02:38:57.980 --> 02:39:01.460
But chatters, if you have any answers to it, let us know.

02:39:01.460 --> 02:39:04.860
There was a game that I remember playing for a while that had something that made me super

02:39:04.860 --> 02:39:07.900
nauseous and I couldn't touch the game for a little while.

02:39:07.900 --> 02:39:08.900
But then I went back.

02:39:08.900 --> 02:39:14.380
I mean, I've had things that they just shake me up right away and I'd have trouble finishing

02:39:14.380 --> 02:39:16.220
the scene.

02:39:16.220 --> 02:39:20.660
And then once I'd digested it for a few days, I could go back and play it and be fine.

02:39:20.660 --> 02:39:21.860
But I can't remember the last one.

02:39:21.860 --> 02:39:27.140
I kind of didn't like the beginning of Alone in the Dark, the original Alone in the Dark,

02:39:27.140 --> 02:39:28.860
because it was hard.

02:39:28.860 --> 02:39:29.860
That's about it.

02:39:29.860 --> 02:39:30.860
I don't know.

02:39:30.860 --> 02:39:31.860
Once again, nothing content-related.

02:39:31.860 --> 02:39:37.500
I mean, fuck, there was the torture scene Grand Theft Auto 5 and I was just like, how

02:39:37.500 --> 02:39:43.140
do I gold this thing because I don't want to have to play this boring minigame again.

02:39:44.140 --> 02:39:47.260
Oh yeah, that's kind of brutal too, I guess.

02:39:47.260 --> 02:39:48.260
All right.

02:39:48.260 --> 02:39:50.700
Well, if I think of something later, I'll let you know.

02:39:50.700 --> 02:39:51.700
That was a good question, though.

02:39:51.700 --> 02:39:52.700
Okay.

02:39:52.700 --> 02:39:53.700
Last email.

02:39:53.700 --> 02:39:54.700
I believe it's last.

02:39:54.700 --> 02:39:56.060
It's the last, as far as I'm concerned.

02:39:56.060 --> 02:39:57.060
Last for tonight.

02:39:57.060 --> 02:39:58.460
Hi folks, it's Raginator.

02:39:58.460 --> 02:40:03.100
Seeing as tonight's episode is the last one before Halloween is spelled with an A, dude.

02:40:03.100 --> 02:40:04.100
Halloween.

02:40:04.100 --> 02:40:05.100
Halloween.

02:40:05.100 --> 02:40:07.180
You spelled it twice.

02:40:07.180 --> 02:40:09.620
You spelled it Halloween.

02:40:09.620 --> 02:40:12.620
Hollow Man is a very good, okay.

02:40:13.100 --> 02:40:14.100
It's a movie that came to me.

02:40:14.100 --> 02:40:15.100
I thought I'd send out Halloween.

02:40:15.100 --> 02:40:17.100
It is All Hallows Eve.

02:40:17.100 --> 02:40:18.100
Hallo.

02:40:18.100 --> 02:40:19.100
Hallo.

02:40:19.100 --> 02:40:24.340
I know that since we're all pretty much in the same age group, around 35 plus or minus

02:40:24.340 --> 02:40:27.420
six years, we don't...

02:40:27.420 --> 02:40:28.420
We are, Raginator.

02:40:28.420 --> 02:40:30.300
I don't know about the listeners, but okay.

02:40:30.300 --> 02:40:32.020
We all don't go trick or treating anymore.

02:40:32.020 --> 02:40:33.020
Yes, we do.

02:40:33.020 --> 02:40:34.020
And haven't done so in years.

02:40:34.020 --> 02:40:35.020
Yes, we have.

02:40:35.020 --> 02:40:36.020
Fuck that shit.

02:40:36.020 --> 02:40:38.440
The Disneyland party is off the hook.

02:40:38.440 --> 02:40:42.580
And for the record, some of us might have kids, so they go trick or treating.

02:40:42.580 --> 02:40:43.580
With their kids.

02:40:43.580 --> 02:40:45.580
Who do you think eats all the candy in the middle of the night?

02:40:45.580 --> 02:40:46.580
Mom!

02:40:46.580 --> 02:40:47.580
Loki.

02:40:47.580 --> 02:40:48.580
I don't eat all the candy.

02:40:48.580 --> 02:40:49.580
I just go to Becky's house and take Julian's.

02:40:49.580 --> 02:40:50.580
My wife would be in there.

02:40:50.580 --> 02:40:54.120
I mean, Becky, if you're listening, I'm not going to steal Julian's candy.

02:40:54.120 --> 02:40:56.220
If you're listening, I'm not going to take Julian's candy.

02:40:56.220 --> 02:40:57.220
Yes.

02:40:57.220 --> 02:40:58.220
No.

02:40:58.220 --> 02:40:59.660
Besides, they keep giving him those stupid peanut butter cups.

02:40:59.660 --> 02:41:02.280
Those things fucking suck.

02:41:02.280 --> 02:41:03.280
My opinion, of course.

02:41:03.280 --> 02:41:04.280
Everyone else likes peanut butter cups.

02:41:04.280 --> 02:41:05.280
I know.

02:41:05.280 --> 02:41:06.280
I know whatever.

02:41:06.280 --> 02:41:07.280
Everyone else likes that shit, but not me.

02:41:07.280 --> 02:41:09.100
And to continue, God, you keep misspelling Halloween.

02:41:09.100 --> 02:41:10.740
God, this is fucking irritating.

02:41:10.740 --> 02:41:13.940
But we may have certain Halloween traditions.

02:41:13.940 --> 02:41:16.420
For me, it's watching movies that would be Halloween appropriate.

02:41:16.420 --> 02:41:18.100
Alien, Aliens, Monster Squad.

02:41:18.100 --> 02:41:19.820
God, I fucking love the Monster Squad.

02:41:19.820 --> 02:41:20.820
Showgirls.

02:41:20.820 --> 02:41:21.820
Girl.

02:41:21.820 --> 02:41:22.820
Fist bump.

02:41:22.820 --> 02:41:23.820
Ghostbusters, etc.

02:41:23.820 --> 02:41:25.820
You are a whore, darlin'.

02:41:25.820 --> 02:41:27.420
Y'all know shit.

02:41:27.420 --> 02:41:32.620
I could do the hand thing, but I'm holding a mic.

02:41:32.620 --> 02:41:34.500
And the same goes with games.

02:41:34.500 --> 02:41:36.620
Nightmare Creatures, Resident Evil 1-3-3, blah.

02:41:36.620 --> 02:41:37.620
I mean, etc.

02:41:37.620 --> 02:41:43.860
Now my question for you is, do you do anything at all similar?

02:41:43.860 --> 02:41:48.100
I sit at home and throw candy at kids.

02:41:48.100 --> 02:41:49.580
I don't know about this year.

02:41:49.580 --> 02:41:51.260
We're going to something.

02:41:51.260 --> 02:41:55.140
I know a lot of people did their Halloween party this weekend, like last night, but we

02:41:55.140 --> 02:41:59.500
got invited to one that's after Halloween, so we're doing that, and my costume that we

02:41:59.500 --> 02:42:02.440
bought the other day is for that.

02:42:02.440 --> 02:42:06.780
But I don't know about on Halloween itself this year.

02:42:06.940 --> 02:42:08.940
Maybe I'll try to invite some people over to watch Showgirls.

02:42:08.940 --> 02:42:09.940
It'll be fun.

02:42:09.940 --> 02:42:11.700
Or I'll go to Jamie's.

02:42:11.700 --> 02:42:12.700
You know what?

02:42:12.700 --> 02:42:13.700
I seriously want to do that.

02:42:13.700 --> 02:42:15.340
You're not doing anything on Halloween, right?

02:42:15.340 --> 02:42:16.700
Is your thing on Halloween?

02:42:16.700 --> 02:42:17.700
Not yet.

02:42:17.700 --> 02:42:18.700
No, it's on, like, the second.

02:42:18.700 --> 02:42:19.700
That's at Showgirls' party at my house.

02:42:19.700 --> 02:42:20.700
Fuck yes.

02:42:20.700 --> 02:42:23.700
We'll just push everything out of the room.

02:42:23.700 --> 02:42:27.100
Can I bring over a kiddie pool and we'll reenact the pool scene with the cats?

02:42:27.100 --> 02:42:28.100
Yes!

02:42:28.100 --> 02:42:29.100
I don't know.

02:42:29.100 --> 02:42:30.100
Midna might bite me.

02:42:30.100 --> 02:42:31.100
I don't.

02:42:31.100 --> 02:42:32.100
Alright.

02:42:32.100 --> 02:42:38.220
No, but, actually, I'm totally down for Showgirls at my house on Halloween.

02:42:38.220 --> 02:42:40.620
You really shouldn't throttle cats like that.

02:42:40.620 --> 02:42:41.620
With mimosas.

02:42:41.620 --> 02:42:42.620
Rob.

02:42:42.620 --> 02:42:45.620
Well, I have to drive home, but.

02:42:45.620 --> 02:42:47.420
I have a couch.

02:42:47.420 --> 02:42:49.100
I gotta work on Friday, girl.

02:42:49.100 --> 02:42:50.100
Girl.

02:42:50.100 --> 02:42:51.100
No.

02:42:51.100 --> 02:42:54.060
Okay, we have mimosas early and then you can, you know, work it off doing the hand wave.

02:42:54.060 --> 02:42:55.060
Alright, alright, read the email.

02:42:55.060 --> 02:42:56.060
Two things.

02:42:56.060 --> 02:42:57.060
That was the email.

02:42:57.060 --> 02:42:58.060
Two random thoughts I just had here.

02:42:58.060 --> 02:42:59.060
Sure.

02:42:59.060 --> 02:43:00.060
Why not?

02:43:00.060 --> 02:43:01.060
Both Showgirls, really.

02:43:01.100 --> 02:43:04.180
Any sort of Kickstarter related game that has to do with Showgirls.

02:43:04.180 --> 02:43:08.820
Perhaps like, you know, a WarioWare type situation where you have all these different mini games

02:43:08.820 --> 02:43:10.500
that have to do with Showgirls.

02:43:10.500 --> 02:43:14.820
And two, I just thought, remember they have that really retarded jib-jab type or whatever

02:43:14.820 --> 02:43:16.220
where you can put your face on stuff?

02:43:16.220 --> 02:43:19.460
They really need to put scenes from Showgirls in there where you can just put your face

02:43:19.460 --> 02:43:20.460
on those characters.

02:43:20.460 --> 02:43:21.460
That'd be hilarious.

02:43:21.460 --> 02:43:22.460
Oh my god.

02:43:22.460 --> 02:43:23.460
You know what I just remembered?

02:43:23.460 --> 02:43:24.460
It would be leotardid.

02:43:24.460 --> 02:43:25.460
Lowkey.

02:43:25.460 --> 02:43:26.460
You know what I just remembered?

02:43:26.460 --> 02:43:27.460
Totally leotardid.

02:43:27.460 --> 02:43:28.460
You know all I know about jib-jab?

02:43:28.460 --> 02:43:29.460
Uh huh.

02:43:29.460 --> 02:43:30.460
Is that this land thing that was made with Romney and Bush?

02:43:30.860 --> 02:43:33.460
I don't see those god-awful Christmas cards singing elf things on Facebook.

02:43:33.460 --> 02:43:35.020
I don't look at that shit.

02:43:35.020 --> 02:43:39.360
The management at my work think those are so clever.

02:43:39.360 --> 02:43:40.360
Every fucking year.

02:43:40.360 --> 02:43:44.020
All I know of jib-jab is the year that they did this land featuring, um, not Romney, what

02:43:44.020 --> 02:43:45.020
I'm saying.

02:43:45.020 --> 02:43:48.180
Um, who was the guy that ran against Bush that we all knew would lose?

02:43:48.180 --> 02:43:49.180
Gore?

02:43:49.180 --> 02:43:50.180
No.

02:43:50.180 --> 02:43:51.180
Um, John Kerry.

02:43:51.180 --> 02:43:52.180
John Kerry.

02:43:52.180 --> 02:43:54.180
You're the guy who, like, an int.

02:43:54.180 --> 02:43:55.180
Yes.

02:43:55.180 --> 02:43:56.180
Yeah.

02:43:56.180 --> 02:43:57.180
Um, yeah.

02:43:57.180 --> 02:43:58.180
That was pretty funny.

02:43:58.180 --> 02:43:59.180
Alright.

02:43:59.220 --> 02:44:03.220
I'm going to chatroom at live.vognetware.com, uh, Tim Tripp suggests a Kinect-based showgirls

02:44:03.220 --> 02:44:04.220
dance game.

02:44:04.220 --> 02:44:07.540
Uh, D'Artezia said, do they do shadowcasts of showgirls?

02:44:07.540 --> 02:44:08.540
Just wondering.

02:44:08.540 --> 02:44:09.540
No.

02:44:09.540 --> 02:44:12.980
And by the way, this is like the third time this year showgirls has come up on the show,

02:44:12.980 --> 02:44:14.420
which has nothing to do with video games.

02:44:14.420 --> 02:44:17.920
I guess that's what makes our show unique, if you can tolerate this chat.

02:44:17.920 --> 02:44:21.540
But I will entertain this question because the one thing I look forward to every year

02:44:21.540 --> 02:44:27.600
in August is at the Castro Theater in San Francisco, California, the drag queen peaches

02:44:27.640 --> 02:44:33.440
Christ and her, yes, that's her name, peaches Christ and her crew put on a midnight showing

02:44:33.440 --> 02:44:35.720
or no, I guess it's the peaches Christ midnight mass.

02:44:35.720 --> 02:44:38.220
I guess they bumped it up a little bit cause we're all getting older.

02:44:38.220 --> 02:44:43.660
It's more like this 8 p.m. showing of showgirls and the bitch comes out of a volcano and they

02:44:43.660 --> 02:44:46.180
all do the dance to goddess and the whole thing.

02:44:46.180 --> 02:44:48.600
And then they do free lap dances with large popcorn.

02:44:48.600 --> 02:44:52.080
And for like the past four or five years, um, Alan and I have been going religiously

02:44:52.080 --> 02:44:53.080
this thing.

02:44:53.080 --> 02:44:54.480
I want to go with you guys next year.

02:44:54.480 --> 02:44:55.480
You came one time.

02:44:55.480 --> 02:44:57.360
I came once, but I didn't get to go this last year.

02:44:57.360 --> 02:45:02.520
I went the year before because we went to a sausage factory, which is a restaurant in

02:45:02.520 --> 02:45:03.520
the Castro.

02:45:03.520 --> 02:45:04.520
Go figure.

02:45:04.520 --> 02:45:08.840
But yes, uh, I pretty much live for that day of the year because I love showgirls and by

02:45:08.840 --> 02:45:13.600
the way, Elizabeth Berkeley on dancing with the stars watching me live.

02:45:13.600 --> 02:45:16.280
Did you see the I'm so excited dance?

02:45:16.280 --> 02:45:17.280
I know, right?

02:45:17.280 --> 02:45:18.280
I don't even watch that show.

02:45:18.280 --> 02:45:19.280
And I watched that.

02:45:19.280 --> 02:45:21.360
Oh, I was like, even Loki saw it.

02:45:21.360 --> 02:45:22.360
You didn't see it.

02:45:22.360 --> 02:45:23.360
Oh, she did.

02:45:23.360 --> 02:45:25.240
You remember saved by the bell, right?

02:45:25.240 --> 02:45:28.880
I didn't even watch saved by the bell and I know that she did a dance related to that

02:45:28.880 --> 02:45:30.400
and they actually like had scenery.

02:45:30.400 --> 02:45:31.400
Yeah.

02:45:31.400 --> 02:45:32.880
She was taking, she was ODing on jive pills.

02:45:32.880 --> 02:45:34.520
It was great.

02:45:34.520 --> 02:45:36.360
And the dance was of course the jive.

02:45:36.360 --> 02:45:43.080
Although I will say this, the best person to ever do the jive on that show was, um,

02:45:43.080 --> 02:45:44.080
Stacy Keebler.

02:45:44.080 --> 02:45:48.760
Just saying, I'll have to look it up, I guess.

02:45:48.760 --> 02:45:49.760
All right.

02:45:49.760 --> 02:45:51.640
Uh, is that it for mailbag?

02:45:51.640 --> 02:45:52.640
It is for now.

02:45:52.640 --> 02:45:53.640
All right.

02:45:53.640 --> 02:45:54.640
Then there you go.

02:45:55.040 --> 02:45:58.320
The next part of the show with the FUs of the week, we get a little angst out of our

02:45:58.320 --> 02:45:59.320
system.

02:45:59.320 --> 02:46:00.320
Why?

02:46:00.320 --> 02:46:01.320
Because

02:46:01.320 --> 02:46:23.880
FU to my state of unemployment again, I'm, I really want this job that I interviewed

02:46:23.880 --> 02:46:28.560
for, it seems like such a great match.

02:46:28.560 --> 02:46:29.840
I hate getting my hopes up too.

02:46:29.840 --> 02:46:36.160
So FU to getting my hopes up because the last few times I've been pretty dashed, but I,

02:46:36.160 --> 02:46:39.120
I feel really positively, I haven't heard anything back yet.

02:46:39.120 --> 02:46:46.840
So FU to the anticipation, FU to the waiting room, and I really, really want this to be

02:46:46.840 --> 02:46:47.840
successful.

02:46:47.840 --> 02:46:49.480
I'd really like this job.

02:46:49.480 --> 02:46:51.480
It would be perfect.

02:46:51.480 --> 02:46:52.520
Perfect.

02:46:52.520 --> 02:46:58.400
And also FU to getting oil paint all over my arm and looking like I've punched a wall.

02:46:58.400 --> 02:47:06.280
I'm painting, um, a portrait in purple and blue or violet and blue and blue violet.

02:47:06.280 --> 02:47:11.120
And I got blue and blue violet all over my right arm going down the bone and it looked

02:47:11.120 --> 02:47:14.520
like I had just hit a wall with the side of my arm.

02:47:14.520 --> 02:47:18.600
So FU to oil paint as well.

02:47:18.600 --> 02:47:20.280
And Rob just came up with a nephew.

02:47:20.280 --> 02:47:25.620
Yeah, I'm going next because I, I will FU to the headache that I just went to the bathroom

02:47:25.620 --> 02:47:29.600
to get Advil for my headache and then FU to the fact that I stubbed my toe on the way

02:47:29.600 --> 02:47:30.600
back.

02:47:30.600 --> 02:47:31.600
It fucking hurts.

02:47:31.600 --> 02:47:32.600
Do you want ice?

02:47:32.600 --> 02:47:33.600
No.

02:47:33.600 --> 02:47:34.600
Kiss it, make it better.

02:47:34.600 --> 02:47:35.600
Eh.

02:47:35.600 --> 02:47:36.600
Loki, what's your FU?

02:47:36.600 --> 02:47:38.680
We'll get the kitty to kiss it.

02:47:38.680 --> 02:47:39.960
Kitty kisses make it all better.

02:47:39.960 --> 02:47:42.160
She's hiding under the bed cause she hates people.

02:47:42.160 --> 02:47:47.940
My FU goes to the city of Folsom and their wonderful event that they had on Friday, their

02:47:47.940 --> 02:47:51.800
Night of a Thousand Pumpkins, which I, see I don't go down the old Folsom because it's

02:47:51.800 --> 02:47:57.820
like this hipster, you know, historic area that they do events in and stuff like that.

02:47:57.820 --> 02:48:00.300
What a bunch of douche bags coming out of there.

02:48:00.300 --> 02:48:05.100
Anyways, but seriously though, they had their thing and see I, I don't do that, but free

02:48:05.100 --> 02:48:07.000
trick or treating and stuff like that.

02:48:07.000 --> 02:48:09.420
They charge parking down there.

02:48:09.420 --> 02:48:14.160
Normally the parking garage is free, but they charge $2 parking for charity.

02:48:14.160 --> 02:48:18.860
The charity happens to be the Folsom Historic Society, basically they run this really shitty

02:48:18.860 --> 02:48:22.440
museum that they have down there that no one fucking goes to and is closed every time I

02:48:22.440 --> 02:48:23.440
go down there.

02:48:23.440 --> 02:48:28.360
So fuck them for that because then I had to go, I had to first off look for parking that

02:48:28.360 --> 02:48:29.740
didn't cost any money.

02:48:29.740 --> 02:48:34.880
Then I had to drive across the bridge to a gas station to use an ATM to get fucking money

02:48:34.880 --> 02:48:40.960
to pay their stupid fee to then park on the roof of this stupid, it was just terrible.

02:48:41.000 --> 02:48:43.800
And the event sucked on top of all of that.

02:48:43.800 --> 02:48:48.000
So you did just give an F you to a $2 charity donation you had to make?

02:48:48.000 --> 02:48:49.000
Yes.

02:48:49.000 --> 02:48:51.000
Just making sure.

02:48:51.000 --> 02:48:52.000
Jason!

02:48:52.000 --> 02:48:57.200
F you to myself for not just, for not being able to just get on a fricking plane.

02:48:57.200 --> 02:49:03.720
It's not hard to get around places and save me a hell of a lot of time in grief.

02:49:03.720 --> 02:49:07.960
I don't mind driving, but some days, whatever.

02:49:08.960 --> 02:49:11.960
Um, and there was a second one.

02:49:11.960 --> 02:49:14.960
F you to money in general.

02:49:14.960 --> 02:49:15.960
I hear that.

02:49:15.960 --> 02:49:16.960
I hear that.

02:49:16.960 --> 02:49:19.960
All right, there it is, the F yous of the week.

02:49:19.960 --> 02:49:20.960
So angsty, so fresh.

02:49:20.960 --> 02:49:21.960
All right.

02:49:21.960 --> 02:49:23.960
Uh, just a few more stories for you guys.

02:49:23.960 --> 02:49:27.960
An F you to misspelling Halloween.

02:49:27.960 --> 02:49:29.960
Poor Ragenator, but then again, we've been picking on that guy forever.

02:49:29.960 --> 02:49:30.960
We still love you, Ragenator.

02:49:30.960 --> 02:49:34.960
Bones did it too, but I'm just being, I just use it as a launch.

02:49:34.960 --> 02:49:36.960
Blame autocorrect.

02:49:36.960 --> 02:49:37.960
That's what people do.

02:49:37.960 --> 02:49:38.960
All right.

02:49:38.960 --> 02:49:40.960
How is that even an autocorrect thing?

02:49:40.960 --> 02:49:42.960
Because it's misspelled.

02:49:42.960 --> 02:49:43.960
Shouldn't autocorrect catch that?

02:49:43.960 --> 02:49:44.960
Calm down, Lee.

02:49:44.960 --> 02:49:49.760
That would be hilarious to like change someone's autocorrect to like wrong stuff.

02:49:49.760 --> 02:49:50.760
It learns.

02:49:50.760 --> 02:49:51.760
Dude.

02:49:51.760 --> 02:49:52.760
Yeah.

02:49:52.760 --> 02:49:57.140
My phone knows like when I start to type L-U-V, it goes, love you, mean it.

02:49:57.140 --> 02:49:58.760
Like it knows that that's a word.

02:49:58.760 --> 02:50:01.160
I want to know how my iPad gets all these things wrong.

02:50:01.160 --> 02:50:03.160
It knows fuckery as a word now.

02:50:03.160 --> 02:50:05.160
My phone knows and ass hattery.

02:50:06.160 --> 02:50:10.160
By the way, I have to go with Quincemia down with capitalism.

02:50:10.160 --> 02:50:15.160
I will say my phone always picks either we're or were wrong and it's actually kind of really

02:50:15.160 --> 02:50:16.160
annoying.

02:50:16.160 --> 02:50:20.160
I do have OMW turn automatically into on my way.

02:50:20.160 --> 02:50:21.160
Everybody does by default.

02:50:21.160 --> 02:50:23.160
Jason, some flight advice from Shane.

02:50:23.160 --> 02:50:24.160
I changed the punctuation.

02:50:24.160 --> 02:50:27.160
From Shane Olinko in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

02:50:27.160 --> 02:50:30.160
Jason, if you're afraid to fly, ask for vodka on the plane.

02:50:30.160 --> 02:50:34.160
I told a flight attendant I was scared and she gave me vodka and orange juice and it

02:50:34.160 --> 02:50:36.160
made the flight super fun.

02:50:38.160 --> 02:50:43.160
I've gotten a lot of similar remedy ideas that and well, I'm sure we can fill in the

02:50:43.160 --> 02:50:44.160
blank.

02:50:44.160 --> 02:50:49.160
Doesn't one of those airlines like Virgin Air or one of them does like a fear of flying

02:50:49.160 --> 02:50:53.160
school or something where you can actually take these classes where they will help cure

02:50:53.160 --> 02:50:54.160
you of your fear of flying.

02:50:54.160 --> 02:50:55.160
Interesting.

02:50:55.160 --> 02:50:57.160
And you live, you don't live that far from Denver, right?

02:50:57.160 --> 02:50:58.160
Right.

02:50:58.160 --> 02:50:59.160
That's where Frontiers Hub is.

02:50:59.160 --> 02:51:02.160
And they're one of those companies that I would imagine would have something like that.

02:51:02.160 --> 02:51:03.160
Check it out.

02:51:03.160 --> 02:51:05.160
You know what the best flight I've ever had was?

02:51:05.160 --> 02:51:09.160
Was a Southwest flight where it was me and Julie.

02:51:09.160 --> 02:51:16.160
We were going to Las Vegas and we got on there and they like totally didn't give a fuck when

02:51:16.160 --> 02:51:18.160
they were doing the flight safety.

02:51:18.160 --> 02:51:19.160
Sounds like Southwest.

02:51:19.160 --> 02:51:23.160
It's like, and if you have any questions, please hesitate to answer.

02:51:23.160 --> 02:51:26.160
If you find the plane going down, you better hold on to your ass because we're going to

02:51:26.160 --> 02:51:27.160
die.

02:51:28.160 --> 02:51:35.160
You can see people like, Oh, and like, and then everyone else is like laughing so hard.

02:51:35.160 --> 02:51:38.160
The people that got scared were embarrassed into laughing with them.

02:51:38.160 --> 02:51:40.160
And then the guy says, just kidding.

02:51:40.160 --> 02:51:43.160
That's like 98 percent.

02:51:43.160 --> 02:51:45.160
What's our statistics?

02:51:45.160 --> 02:51:46.160
It was great.

02:51:46.160 --> 02:51:49.160
That's the best flight I've ever been on.

02:51:49.160 --> 02:51:51.160
You just need liquor and pills, Jason.

02:51:51.160 --> 02:51:52.160
It makes it easier.

02:51:52.160 --> 02:51:53.160
All right.

02:51:53.160 --> 02:51:54.160
Moving on.

02:51:54.160 --> 02:51:56.160
You know what, though?

02:51:56.160 --> 02:52:00.160
I, some people don't have the patience to do the drive or the train or anything like

02:52:00.160 --> 02:52:01.160
that.

02:52:01.160 --> 02:52:06.160
So, you know, at least you get to see such beautiful parts of the country as Elko, Nevada,

02:52:06.160 --> 02:52:10.160
and all of Southern Wyoming across and the no tell motels.

02:52:10.160 --> 02:52:16.160
Did we know the whole thing about flight is, you know, trying to say is going to the bathroom

02:52:16.160 --> 02:52:18.160
on the plane worthwhile.

02:52:18.160 --> 02:52:23.160
Do I need to get out of my window seat to go pee or can I hold it?

02:52:23.160 --> 02:52:25.160
Always go to the bathroom on the plane.

02:52:25.160 --> 02:52:27.160
You're never going to see those people again in your entire life.

02:52:27.160 --> 02:52:30.160
And, Gamet, there's a way for a plane to have Fireball on it.

02:52:30.160 --> 02:52:32.160
You get the little, um...

02:52:32.160 --> 02:52:34.160
You mean the liquor, not the...

02:52:34.160 --> 02:52:35.160
The liquor.

02:52:35.160 --> 02:52:36.160
Yes.

02:52:36.160 --> 02:52:37.160
Thank you.

02:52:37.160 --> 02:52:43.160
They do have these little flasks that are disguised as tampons.

02:52:43.160 --> 02:52:44.160
I kid you not.

02:52:44.160 --> 02:52:46.160
They're actually for yachts, but...

02:52:46.160 --> 02:52:49.160
Speaking of things you do because you'll never see the other people on the plane ever again.

02:52:49.160 --> 02:52:52.160
This is a video game show, right?

02:52:52.160 --> 02:52:54.160
We will talk about that at some point.

02:52:54.160 --> 02:52:57.160
We just said this was a slow news week.

02:52:57.160 --> 02:52:58.160
Fuck it.

02:52:58.160 --> 02:52:59.160
We're filling space.

02:52:59.160 --> 02:53:00.160
True.

02:53:00.160 --> 02:53:01.160
True.

02:53:01.160 --> 02:53:03.160
This is our new version of the fuck it show.

02:53:03.160 --> 02:53:04.160
All right.

02:53:04.160 --> 02:53:06.160
We got to get to phone calls too.

02:53:06.160 --> 02:53:09.160
Loki's got one more story for us and then we're going to get to the phone calls.

02:53:09.160 --> 02:53:13.160
1-877-GAMO-LR, username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:53:13.160 --> 02:53:14.160
Loki, what do you have for us?

02:53:14.160 --> 02:53:16.160
So I guess Second Life is happening soon.

02:53:16.160 --> 02:53:17.160
November 2nd.

02:53:17.160 --> 02:53:19.160
You mean Extra Life?

02:53:19.160 --> 02:53:21.160
Extra Life, whatever.

02:53:21.160 --> 02:53:23.160
Yeah, okay.

02:53:23.160 --> 02:53:25.160
So yes, Extra Life.

02:53:25.160 --> 02:53:28.160
And November 2nd.

02:53:28.160 --> 02:53:33.160
So donate, sponsor people, do all that fun stuff.

02:53:33.160 --> 02:53:38.160
Ah, it's this weekend for the Children's Miracle Network.

02:53:38.160 --> 02:53:46.160
I think it's great that this charity kind of has really embraced this whole thing and kind of really made it one of their highlight fundraisers of the year.

02:53:46.160 --> 02:53:51.160
I don't know if you've seen this, but on PlayStation 3 they actually have an ad for Extra Life right now.

02:53:51.160 --> 02:53:54.160
And if you raise certain amounts of money you get PlayStation rewards with that.

02:53:54.160 --> 02:53:57.160
So I thought that was really cool that it all kind of integrates together.

02:53:57.160 --> 02:54:00.160
So, awesome.

02:54:00.160 --> 02:54:01.160
All right.

02:54:01.160 --> 02:54:03.160
Good luck to those of you doing Extra Life, by the way.

02:54:03.160 --> 02:54:08.160
I'd love to do it, but my wife wouldn't let me have 25 hours of pure gaming.

02:54:08.160 --> 02:54:13.160
We need to do something charity related, but I would really love to.

02:54:13.160 --> 02:54:16.160
I have things to tell you offline regarding.

02:54:16.160 --> 02:54:20.160
I would suggest, you know, we'll probably do the MS Walk again with Horde House next year.

02:54:20.160 --> 02:54:22.160
And I'd really like OLR to get involved with that too.

02:54:22.160 --> 02:54:24.160
Maybe we can raise a ton of money for a great cause.

02:54:24.160 --> 02:54:25.160
So we'll look at that.

02:54:25.160 --> 02:54:28.160
But for now, Extra Life, good luck to those of you doing it.

02:54:28.160 --> 02:54:31.160
And yeah, I'll have to watch some of those streams myself.

02:54:31.160 --> 02:54:35.160
All right, we're going to go right into phone calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

02:54:35.160 --> 02:54:38.160
We're going to skip what I had on the show roll because I had this.

02:54:38.160 --> 02:54:41.160
It was a Twitter news story and it ain't even worth it.

02:54:41.160 --> 02:54:46.160
And the more I think about it, my eyes roll so far back in the back of my head, I can see my brain.

02:54:46.160 --> 02:54:50.160
If you are dying to know what I was going to report on, that whole Sessler Gate thing.

02:54:50.160 --> 02:54:51.160
That's all I'm going to say.

02:54:51.160 --> 02:54:53.160
I don't even know what you're talking about.

02:54:53.160 --> 02:54:55.160
I have no idea what that is.

02:54:55.160 --> 02:54:56.160
Well, here I go.

02:54:56.160 --> 02:54:58.160
No, it's perfect. Call it done.

02:54:58.160 --> 02:55:00.160
Let's talk about it. Come on.

02:55:00.160 --> 02:55:01.160
We do have a call.

02:55:01.160 --> 02:55:02.160
And we'll talk about how ridiculous it is.

02:55:02.160 --> 02:55:03.160
Okay, quickly.

02:55:03.160 --> 02:55:10.160
He's whining on Twitter because supposedly there is something about the new console that's going to make it hard to do his job.

02:55:10.160 --> 02:55:13.160
Like some big thing that isn't announced yet.

02:55:13.160 --> 02:55:16.160
And it's not Xbox One, it's PlayStation 4.

02:55:16.160 --> 02:55:17.160
That's all been deduced.

02:55:17.160 --> 02:55:25.160
This is Reddit, Twitter, all these folks running NeoGaf and they've all got threads on it today.

02:55:25.160 --> 02:55:27.160
And nobody really knows what it is.

02:55:27.160 --> 02:55:34.160
And some of the popular thoughts are that perhaps Sony has invoked what Nintendo did earlier this year on YouTube.

02:55:34.160 --> 02:55:38.160
Where there's going to be that restriction where they're not going to be able to monetize their YouTube videos.

02:55:38.160 --> 02:55:41.160
Again, thoughts, rumors, speculation.

02:55:41.160 --> 02:55:45.160
But I don't know if that would be it necessarily.

02:55:45.160 --> 02:55:49.160
Because I think when Nintendo announced that, nobody got warning about that.

02:55:49.160 --> 02:55:50.160
That just happened.

02:55:50.160 --> 02:55:54.160
And that isn't supposed to impact review videos in fair use.

02:55:54.160 --> 02:56:01.160
My thought is, genuinely, is that it's the PlayStation 4 preview review events.

02:56:01.160 --> 02:56:04.160
Because it doesn't sound like they're sending out copies of PlayStation 4 games to people.

02:56:04.160 --> 02:56:06.160
You have to come in and play them.

02:56:06.160 --> 02:56:08.160
And that's what they do for audio CDs.

02:56:08.160 --> 02:56:09.160
And a lot of those critics have to do.

02:56:09.160 --> 02:56:11.160
Why? Piracy.

02:56:11.160 --> 02:56:13.160
Because people ruined it.

02:56:13.160 --> 02:56:18.160
And if you have to go somewhere else to play the game, you can't get video in advance.

02:56:18.160 --> 02:56:22.160
That might ruin your day if you are somebody who does a lot of YouTube video reviews.

02:56:22.160 --> 02:56:24.160
So, I don't know.

02:56:24.160 --> 02:56:27.160
It's hard for me to feel sorry.

02:56:27.160 --> 02:56:31.160
But it certainly is an interesting challenge about the new generation.

02:56:32.160 --> 02:56:35.160
Whatever. So, there you go. In a nutshell, there's your story.

02:56:35.160 --> 02:56:37.160
Now we can go to the calls.

02:56:37.160 --> 02:56:38.160
Yes.

02:56:38.160 --> 02:56:39.160
1877 Game O.L.R.

02:56:39.160 --> 02:56:41.160
I saw a Doctor Who icon. You better answer it.

02:56:41.160 --> 02:56:43.160
I will. Please call. 1877 Game O.L.R.

02:56:43.160 --> 02:56:46.160
Our username on Skype. Orange Lounge Radio.

02:56:46.160 --> 02:56:48.160
You can call in now and I will take the call.

02:56:48.160 --> 02:56:52.160
In the meantime, do we have last minute stories? Probably not tonight.

02:56:52.160 --> 02:56:54.160
No.

02:56:54.160 --> 02:56:55.160
We had hardly any stories tonight.

02:56:55.160 --> 02:56:57.160
I think you just took the last minute story.

02:56:57.160 --> 02:56:58.160
Yeah. There you go.

02:56:58.160 --> 02:57:01.160
I did see a couple tweets and they were things worth mentioning.

02:57:01.160 --> 02:57:02.160
So, I want to get to that.

02:57:02.160 --> 02:57:06.160
But again, if you want to call 1877 Game O.L.R.

02:57:06.160 --> 02:57:08.160
Our username on Skype. Orange Lounge Radio.

02:57:08.160 --> 02:57:09.160
I want Bobby to call.

02:57:09.160 --> 02:57:11.160
But you excluded him in chat.

02:57:11.160 --> 02:57:13.160
I didn't exclude him. I said other people.

02:57:13.160 --> 02:57:15.160
I just said we also want some new people too.

02:57:15.160 --> 02:57:16.160
Alright.

02:57:16.160 --> 02:57:17.160
I encourage.

02:57:17.160 --> 02:57:19.160
Let's get to the phones and see who's there.

02:57:19.160 --> 02:57:21.160
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

02:57:21.160 --> 02:57:23.160
Hey, what's up guys? This is Kaijuto.

02:57:23.160 --> 02:57:25.160
Hey, Kaijuto. What's up? Long time no talk.

02:57:25.160 --> 02:57:26.160
Hey, Doctor Who icon.

02:57:27.160 --> 02:57:33.160
Yeah, nothing much. I just wanted to answer the question that one of your listeners proposed to you earlier today.

02:57:33.160 --> 02:57:36.160
About the. Well, how was it worded?

02:57:36.160 --> 02:57:39.160
Where you played a game and it was so disturbing that it made you stop.

02:57:39.160 --> 02:57:40.160
Yes.

02:57:40.160 --> 02:57:43.160
Yeah, I had a scene that made you just completely not want to play the rest of it.

02:57:43.160 --> 02:57:44.160
Yes.

02:57:44.160 --> 02:57:47.160
Yeah, my game is Grand Theft Auto Vice City.

02:57:47.160 --> 02:57:52.160
There's a mission in that game where I think there's like a mob boss or something.

02:57:52.160 --> 02:57:55.160
And they want you to kill his wife. They want you to run her off the road.

02:57:56.160 --> 02:57:58.160
And I couldn't do that for the life of me.

02:57:58.160 --> 02:58:02.160
Like you, you hear her like literally asking you like, why are you doing this to me?

02:58:02.160 --> 02:58:03.160
Why are you trying to kill me?

02:58:03.160 --> 02:58:08.160
It was so disturbing that I turned the game off, never finished it, never played it.

02:58:08.160 --> 02:58:10.160
And that was back in 2002.

02:58:12.160 --> 02:58:18.160
You know, it's hard for me to sit here and go, wow, you're so crazy for that answer or something like that.

02:58:18.160 --> 02:58:19.160
Because I kind of sit here and go.

02:58:19.160 --> 02:58:20.160
That's pretty admirable.

02:58:20.160 --> 02:58:23.160
That's. Yeah, you just sound like a nice guy to me.

02:58:23.160 --> 02:58:26.160
Yeah, I mean, if it was the mob guy would have shot him in the face, no problem.

02:58:26.160 --> 02:58:29.160
You know, lock him in the, lock him in the trunk, do whatever.

02:58:29.160 --> 02:58:33.160
But I don't know, it was just the fact that I felt she was an innocent.

02:58:33.160 --> 02:58:38.160
You know, like when you play Grand Theft Auto, I mean, anyone that you kill in that game, you know, they're usually just criminals.

02:58:38.160 --> 02:58:41.160
And, you know, they're they're either going to kill you before you kill them.

02:58:41.160 --> 02:58:45.160
So you kind of you know, you kind of like work that out in your mind that, OK, you know, this is justifiable.

02:58:45.160 --> 02:58:48.160
But I don't know, just killing that woman wasn't justifiable.

02:58:48.160 --> 02:58:52.160
I could research and see if she had a meth lab or, you know, a child smuggling ring.

02:58:52.160 --> 02:58:56.160
Well, well, this was in the 80s, so you were in any meth labs.

02:58:56.160 --> 02:59:00.160
If anything, she was a cocaine queen or whatever the fuck.

02:59:00.160 --> 02:59:13.160
You also kind of bring up an interesting point that it's like it's maybe kind of partially the realism of that that really kind of pushed it over the edge for you is that it was a little too realistic because I think like, OK, well, when I play Saints Row four or Saints Row three, excuse me.

02:59:13.160 --> 02:59:15.160
And I try to run over as many people on the road as I can.

02:59:15.160 --> 02:59:18.160
That's funny, but it's not realistic.

02:59:18.160 --> 02:59:21.160
Like, it's totally not realistic or like Armageddon or any of those things.

02:59:21.160 --> 02:59:24.160
Like it's just it's just cartoon characters. I'm running over my car and it's funny.

02:59:24.160 --> 02:59:27.160
But like they are not screaming like, please. Oh, God.

02:59:27.160 --> 02:59:30.160
You know, like they're not like it doesn't get that real.

02:59:30.160 --> 02:59:34.160
Like it's just funny and like so my brain can easily differentiate.

02:59:34.160 --> 02:59:39.160
But I can see where like, you know, if this poor innocent woman is screaming her head off, like, please don't kill her.

02:59:39.160 --> 02:59:44.160
Like, yeah, it's kind of like maybe I maybe I don't want to do this.

02:59:44.160 --> 02:59:47.160
Yeah, it was exactly that.

02:59:47.160 --> 02:59:51.160
It was the fact that she was she was screaming and like literally talking to me and asking me why.

02:59:51.160 --> 02:59:57.160
And, you know, in Grand Theft Auto, you don't you don't talk. So it's like I couldn't really explain to her why.

02:59:57.160 --> 03:00:02.160
Are you trying to explain from the couch and it's not working.

03:00:02.160 --> 03:00:09.160
So, well, that is I'm curious enough. Loki remembers that part because he's the big Grand Theft Auto guy.

03:00:09.160 --> 03:00:12.160
No, I don't remember that.

03:00:12.160 --> 03:00:17.160
I don't remember if I am that cold blooded man. I don't remember finishing Vice City.

03:00:17.160 --> 03:00:23.160
I don't know if I ever did. Hmm. Because you didn't really, really get crazy about Grand Theft Auto until just the last one.

03:00:23.160 --> 03:00:28.160
I think I ever finished three or Vice City. Maybe I did.

03:00:28.160 --> 03:00:33.160
I don't remember. It was a long time ago. But look, he was looking was rocking out to the music so hard.

03:00:33.160 --> 03:00:38.160
He didn't even hear the cheat codes. I'm going to blow stuff up. And that's pretty much it.

03:00:38.160 --> 03:00:43.160
You know, I know I didn't finish Sandra's and I just want to finish it because I mean,

03:00:43.160 --> 03:00:47.160
I love Vice City. I love the 80s. I mean, I have like a nice vibe to it, but just that part.

03:00:47.160 --> 03:00:52.160
But I'm going to hang up now. Let some more calls get in.

03:00:52.160 --> 03:00:57.160
All right. I was talking to you guys again. I'll be calling in more. Sounds good. Good to hear from you.

03:00:57.160 --> 03:01:02.160
All right. Take care, buddy. Bye. One eight seven seven game oil are his name on Skype, Orange Laundry.

03:01:02.160 --> 03:01:06.160
Did you get to compliment the doctor who icon? I think you did at the beginning. I did. He did have a doctor who icon.

03:01:06.160 --> 03:01:11.160
And then the whole time during his phone call, I was playing the old theme since he had the 80s icon.

03:01:11.160 --> 03:01:16.160
It was classic who not not a new who. Are you going to go to that whole 3D screening of

03:01:16.160 --> 03:01:21.160
Doctor Who or whatever? I heard about this because I hate people. Oh, that's a fair answer.

03:01:21.160 --> 03:01:26.160
I hate going to the movies like I don't like going to opening night anything. I don't either.

03:01:26.160 --> 03:01:31.160
Unless it's like something I'm super excited about. But it's like I have to see the Hunger Games catching fire.

03:01:31.160 --> 03:01:36.160
I just don't like people that much. I don't blame you. Well, we like this person that's calling in right now.

03:01:36.160 --> 03:01:41.160
Hi. Are you there? I'm right here and I'm glad you like this person. I do like this person.

03:01:41.160 --> 03:01:46.160
Hey, Rama. How you doing? I'm doing pretty good. A little tired, but I'm good. Yeah.

03:01:46.160 --> 03:01:51.160
Was there a con this weekend? No, but I work and now my commute, instead of being

03:01:51.160 --> 03:01:56.160
from Brooklyn to Midtown Manhattan, is from Brooklyn to Jersey. So three hour commute every single day.

03:01:57.160 --> 03:02:02.160
Oh my gosh. But I was going to say, as far as the anime cons go too, Halloween is the one time

03:02:02.160 --> 03:02:07.160
of the year where you're supposed to dress up. So it's like, it's cosplayers vacation.

03:02:07.160 --> 03:02:13.160
Or as I like to call it, National Cosplayers Day. Fair enough. And you know I'm just teasing you.

03:02:13.160 --> 03:02:18.160
I'm all for it. What else is on your mind, buddy? Three things and I'll make it quick.

03:02:18.160 --> 03:02:24.160
Number one, and whereas this is a frugal question of the week, I'll make this part brief.

03:02:24.160 --> 03:02:30.160
I was playing Bioshock. Going through the level. My old roommate was standing there with his D&D crew.

03:02:30.160 --> 03:02:36.160
And they watched me play the game. I come to this one section where there is a casket sitting on a shelf.

03:02:36.160 --> 03:02:43.160
I'm like, okay. I walk over to it. The casket explodes. There are demon, creatures coming at me.

03:02:43.160 --> 03:02:48.160
I'm killing them and I'm like, what the fuck is this? Holy shit, what the fuck?

03:02:48.160 --> 03:02:53.160
I kill them all and I'm just staring at the screen. I pause it and I drop the controller and it's like, fuck this.

03:02:53.160 --> 03:02:57.160
I'm done. Well played, Bioshock. Well played.

03:02:57.160 --> 03:03:02.160
Well, there you go. That is a scary game that nobody brought up earlier. So, good answer.

03:03:02.160 --> 03:03:05.160
Yeah, but mind you, I was playing with the lights on.

03:03:08.160 --> 03:03:10.160
What else is on your mind, buddy?

03:03:10.160 --> 03:03:12.160
Anyone? Anyone?

03:03:12.160 --> 03:03:14.160
No, I was just saying, what else is on your mind, buddy?

03:03:14.160 --> 03:03:20.160
My bad. My bad. Second thing, this was passed to me, someone on my fan page.

03:03:20.160 --> 03:03:25.160
And they are spreading the words of their Extra Life campaign out of Ohio.

03:03:27.160 --> 03:03:37.160
The group is called Happy Family and Friends. They're trying to raise $1200 for a local hospital out of Children's Miracle Network Hospital in Ohio.

03:03:37.160 --> 03:03:39.160
So, I'm just trying to spread the word of that.

03:03:39.160 --> 03:03:42.160
So, this is a part of the Extra Life, like one of the groups doing it.

03:03:42.160 --> 03:03:45.160
Okay, awesome. Well, we're all for that, all for charity events.

03:03:45.160 --> 03:03:48.160
How can we find more information on this? What games are they playing? Do we know?

03:03:48.160 --> 03:03:57.160
They have not mentioned, but they did say there's going to be a lot of video games, anime, Kevin Smith, crude humor. Did I mention Kevin Smith?

03:03:57.160 --> 03:04:01.160
Is Kevin Smith going to be there or are they just watching Chasing Amy?

03:04:01.160 --> 03:04:04.160
Nobody watches Chasing Amy. I thought you knew this.

03:04:04.160 --> 03:04:06.160
Fuck you, I love that movie.

03:04:06.160 --> 03:04:08.160
Hey!

03:04:08.160 --> 03:04:10.160
So, you're a Tracer.

03:04:10.160 --> 03:04:14.160
I will let you slide on it because you didn't say Jersey Girl.

03:04:14.160 --> 03:04:16.160
No, God no. Who would say Jersey Girl?

03:04:16.160 --> 03:04:18.160
At least he didn't raise his hand and ask, what's a Nubian?

03:04:18.160 --> 03:04:20.160
Oh, what's a Nubian?

03:04:20.160 --> 03:04:22.160
Shut the fuck up!

03:04:22.160 --> 03:04:25.160
That's how I incur the wrath of a black man, Rama.

03:04:25.160 --> 03:04:27.160
Alright.

03:04:27.160 --> 03:04:30.160
I just like that that whole exchange was staged in the movie. That was great.

03:04:30.160 --> 03:04:34.160
In all seriousness, what else is on your mind, buddy? You said three things.

03:04:34.160 --> 03:04:38.160
Yeah, I already told him this. Now, I'm going to let you guys know.

03:04:38.160 --> 03:04:48.160
As you know, I have this issue with Chain Stop and I refuse to give them my money for the way they treat some of their customers and their products and this and that.

03:04:48.160 --> 03:04:50.160
Or their employees.

03:04:50.160 --> 03:04:52.160
Yep, them too.

03:04:52.160 --> 03:04:59.160
Long story short, old roommate reimbursed me money for a game that he can't find, so I go buy a used copy.

03:04:59.160 --> 03:05:09.160
I go in, they have their special, two games for $10. I happen to notice at least a good quarter of the games on it are games I need for my PS3.

03:05:09.160 --> 03:05:18.160
So, I've come to the conclusion that as long as it's not a new game, games I will see a little portion of my money.

03:05:18.160 --> 03:05:26.160
So, what made you decide that ethically you're going to decide, okay, I'll boycott GameStop most of the time?

03:05:26.160 --> 03:05:36.160
I figure, you know, I might as well get a good deal on a used game as long as I have the game, the manual, and the original box art.

03:05:36.160 --> 03:05:39.160
If not, I'll go to Amazon and spend an extra $10.

03:05:39.160 --> 03:05:48.160
I mean, eventually you just can't boycott fully forever. Eventually you get to that point where you know what?

03:05:48.160 --> 03:05:54.160
Eff it. Might as well. I'm just going to go in, get what I want, and leave.

03:05:54.160 --> 03:06:01.160
As long as they don't ask me for power up rewards, as long as they don't ask me to reserve this or that, I just want the game and I want to go.

03:06:01.160 --> 03:06:06.160
That's part of the reason I like Amazon, because like Jamie, I don't like people sometimes.

03:06:06.160 --> 03:06:15.160
And Amazon, you just click your thing, or any online site really, I know I keep hitting that one, but you just go on, you order what you want, and then it magically shows up at your door. It's great.

03:06:15.160 --> 03:06:24.160
Yeah, at least you don't have to deal with this. You go into the store to buy something, headphones are on, and they're talking to you like you can hear them.

03:06:24.160 --> 03:06:25.160
Right.

03:06:25.160 --> 03:06:35.160
You can kind of hear them, but you know the transaction, what you're doing, so you just want them to just pull up the screen, you can punch in your rewards card, pay for your item, and leave.

03:06:35.160 --> 03:06:40.160
Alright, well Ram, I'm going to let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thank you as always for the call.

03:06:40.160 --> 03:06:41.160
Ain't no problem broski.

03:06:41.160 --> 03:06:43.160
And everybody listen to Anime Jam Session.

03:06:43.160 --> 03:06:51.160
Yes, because we will be covering what may be our very last con that we're going to, but we have another con review coming up in a couple weeks after that.

03:06:51.160 --> 03:06:53.160
Well then it's not really your last con, is it?

03:06:53.160 --> 03:06:55.160
For the staff, yes.

03:06:55.160 --> 03:06:57.160
Wait, so you guys are quitting cons?

03:06:57.160 --> 03:06:59.160
No, we're done for the year.

03:06:59.160 --> 03:07:01.160
Oh, for the year. Oh god, I was like, oh my god, wait a minute.

03:07:01.160 --> 03:07:04.160
Oh, no, no, no, never. Never.

03:07:04.160 --> 03:07:09.160
I was like, Ram, what the fuck is going on? Okay, for the year, that makes sense.

03:07:09.160 --> 03:07:14.160
No, I think my funeral services might be at a con. That's how much of a con for I am.

03:07:14.160 --> 03:07:26.160
Rama, not that I want to talk about that day anytime soon, but if I happen to still be here when that happens, I will see to it that the fucking kids pay their respects to the great black Luigi.

03:07:26.160 --> 03:07:30.160
Will we be putting up the death note with your name in it?

03:07:30.160 --> 03:07:33.160
This time I will allow it.

03:07:33.160 --> 03:07:35.160
Alright, take care buddy.

03:07:35.160 --> 03:07:46.160
For the record, one last thing. Every time I see someone refer to SNK, I don't think of the anime, I think of my... and all the King of Fighters games.

03:07:46.160 --> 03:07:48.160
I always think of Capcom vs SNK 2, which is me.

03:07:48.160 --> 03:07:53.160
I keep thinking of Shingeki no Kyojin. You start reading the manga, it's phenomenal.

03:07:53.160 --> 03:07:55.160
Yeah, I don't think I'm gonna.

03:07:55.160 --> 03:07:57.160
You have to, it's so good.

03:07:57.160 --> 03:07:58.160
I gotta wrap up, take care buddy.

03:07:58.160 --> 03:07:59.160
Later.

03:08:00.160 --> 03:08:06.160
That's gonna do it for the Skypline tonight. I'm really sorry to those that didn't get through, but if you want to call in in a future week, you can do that.

03:08:06.160 --> 03:08:16.160
Call in, or you can always leave an email at mailbagatorangelaungeradio.com, a Facebook comment at facebook.com slash orangelaungeradio, or a tweet at twitter.com slash o-l-r.

03:08:16.160 --> 03:08:19.160
Speaking of tweets, I have a few of these to do tonight.

03:08:19.160 --> 03:08:22.160
sj100matt sent us a few tweets.

03:08:22.160 --> 03:08:26.160
This one you sent us about Neon FM was in last week's show, just a heads up.

03:08:26.160 --> 03:08:31.160
But the other one is about the Conan O'Brien thing where he played the scary games.

03:08:31.160 --> 03:08:34.160
I've seen the tweets about this, I haven't watched this yet.

03:08:34.160 --> 03:08:38.160
But I'll have to check this out, I don't want to play it over the air because it's Conan's thing.

03:08:38.160 --> 03:08:43.160
But check that out, I'm sure it's hilarious because Conan is hilarious.

03:08:43.160 --> 03:08:48.160
I paid a lot of money to see him live after he got kicked off of NBC and it was worth every penny.

03:08:48.160 --> 03:08:49.160
So good times.

03:08:49.160 --> 03:08:53.160
So check that out, he plays Slender the Eight pages and Amnesia and I'm sure it's great.

03:08:54.160 --> 03:08:56.160
Tigerclaw sent us a few tweets.

03:08:56.160 --> 03:09:01.160
Classic games are now preserved and accessible on archive.org.

03:09:01.160 --> 03:09:06.160
How does this work? Because isn't emulation kind of a gray area? I'm trying to read about this.

03:09:06.160 --> 03:09:10.160
The Internet Archive has created the Historical Software Archive,

03:09:10.160 --> 03:09:15.160
which is significantly older software runnable in a browser, which includes many games.

03:09:15.160 --> 03:09:20.160
Thanks to JSMess, the multi-emulator supersystem available in Java.

03:09:21.160 --> 03:09:25.160
Jason Scott from the Internet Archive's site says,

03:09:25.160 --> 03:09:29.160
We have the ability to watch video, listen to music, and read documents right in our browsers.

03:09:29.160 --> 03:09:32.160
Not so with classic software until now.

03:09:32.160 --> 03:09:37.160
Included in the collection are games such as Mystery House by Roberta Williams,

03:09:37.160 --> 03:09:40.160
Karateka by Jordan Mechner, I remember that game,

03:09:40.160 --> 03:09:44.160
and Atari's infamous E.T., the extraterrestrial.

03:09:44.160 --> 03:09:49.160
I had no idea, like does the copyright lift on this after so many years?

03:09:49.160 --> 03:09:51.160
I thought it was like 75 years and then some.

03:09:51.160 --> 03:09:54.160
Because the Disney laws keep getting passed to keep Mickey Mouse out of public domain.

03:09:54.160 --> 03:09:57.160
He might not have renewed that one.

03:09:57.160 --> 03:09:59.160
I guess that's true.

03:09:59.160 --> 03:10:04.160
Or maybe because emulation is such a gray area because these games are so old,

03:10:04.160 --> 03:10:07.160
like maybe it's just not a big deal. I don't know.

03:10:07.160 --> 03:10:10.160
But that's still pretty cool. I'll check that out after the show.

03:10:10.160 --> 03:10:15.160
One other quick tweet here from Tigerclaw. It's about the Mortal Kombat film director,

03:10:16.160 --> 03:10:20.160
Kevin Tancho Rowan. I'm totally mispronouncing that name, sorry.

03:10:20.160 --> 03:10:24.160
He's the director of Mortal Kombat Legacy and he has walked away from it.

03:10:24.160 --> 03:10:26.160
He talked about it on Twitter.

03:10:26.160 --> 03:10:31.160
He did the Mortal Kombat Legacy web series and that was after Mortal Kombat Rebirth.

03:10:31.160 --> 03:10:36.160
New Line Cinema actually asked him to direct a future film in the Mortal Kombat universe,

03:10:36.160 --> 03:10:38.160
but he said,

03:10:38.160 --> 03:10:42.160
After three years of combat, I've decided to move on to other creative opportunities.

03:10:42.160 --> 03:10:46.160
I wish everyone involved in the movie a big success. Thanks.

03:10:46.160 --> 03:10:49.160
I can see that. Three years is a long time to spend on one project.

03:10:49.160 --> 03:10:52.160
You might not want your life and your career defined by the one thing.

03:10:52.160 --> 03:10:54.160
So, I can see that.

03:10:54.160 --> 03:10:58.160
Speaking of video games becoming movies, you know, BlizzCon is in two weeks

03:10:58.160 --> 03:11:01.160
and there's going to be lots of Warcraft movie news that comes out of that, I'm sure.

03:11:01.160 --> 03:11:04.160
I think they cast their first person too. I think I remember seeing a story on that too,

03:11:04.160 --> 03:11:07.160
that their first official person is cast in that.

03:11:07.160 --> 03:11:11.160
Oh, I know Tigerclaw tweeted that at some point,

03:11:11.160 --> 03:11:15.160
but I don't have it up on the screen right now and it is live radio.

03:11:17.160 --> 03:11:20.160
I think it's probably on the Horde House page.

03:11:20.160 --> 03:11:24.160
I'm sure it got posted there. I'm trying to find it right now.

03:11:24.160 --> 03:11:26.160
Nah, I can't bring it up. I don't remember the guy's name.

03:11:26.160 --> 03:11:32.160
Maybe somebody will yell it out in chat, but it was from some Viking thing on TV.

03:11:32.160 --> 03:11:35.160
I didn't recognize the name of the guy.

03:11:35.160 --> 03:11:37.160
There was stuff about Colin Farrell in the past.

03:11:37.160 --> 03:11:39.160
Yeah, those are rumors.

03:11:39.160 --> 03:11:46.160
Him and Paula Patton, who is Robin Thicke's wife, is rumored for that movie too.

03:11:46.160 --> 03:11:49.160
We don't know who they're playing though. They haven't said anything about that.

03:11:49.160 --> 03:11:53.160
Alright, we'll get into more of that on Horde House.

03:11:53.160 --> 03:11:56.160
But for now, this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio...

03:11:56.160 --> 03:11:57.160
Travis Fimmel.

03:11:57.160 --> 03:11:58.160
Thank you, thank you.

03:11:58.160 --> 03:12:01.160
This week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio is about to an end.

03:12:01.160 --> 03:12:04.160
Hey, I want to thank you guys for tuning in and listening to the show.

03:12:04.160 --> 03:12:08.160
Thank you for supporting our little podcast that we do here every week.

03:12:08.160 --> 03:12:10.160
We do this for you guys. You're great.

03:12:10.160 --> 03:12:14.160
And if you like what you hear here at Orange Lounge Radio, please just help us spread the word.

03:12:14.160 --> 03:12:17.160
Leave us a nice review on iTunes or a thumbs up on Stitcher.

03:12:17.160 --> 03:12:19.160
Actually, Stitcher does reviews now. I don't know if you guys know that.

03:12:19.160 --> 03:12:23.160
Stitcher has reviews, so you can review us there. That would be fantastic.

03:12:23.160 --> 03:12:28.160
Or wherever you found out about this podcast, somebody else will probably find out about this podcast too.

03:12:28.160 --> 03:12:30.160
So please help us spread the word.

03:12:30.160 --> 03:12:33.160
In the meantime, we're going to go around and get everybody's final thought.

03:12:33.160 --> 03:12:36.160
Jason, thank you very much for taking the drive up here to be with us tonight.

03:12:36.160 --> 03:12:37.160
Always.

03:12:37.160 --> 03:12:38.160
A little voiceover work you do on the show.

03:12:38.160 --> 03:12:39.160
Always.

03:12:39.160 --> 03:12:41.160
And thank you for being you.

03:12:41.160 --> 03:12:43.160
Thank you for the washer and dryer.

03:12:43.160 --> 03:12:49.160
It's the least I can do for the guy that helped keep our website up and running for the past so many years.

03:12:49.160 --> 03:12:50.160
Decade?

03:12:50.160 --> 03:12:51.160
Yeah, for the past decade.

03:12:51.160 --> 03:12:53.160
It feels like a little bit under that. I think, what, 2004?

03:12:53.160 --> 03:12:56.160
I think I was graduated by the time everything really happened. Maybe not.

03:12:56.160 --> 03:13:01.160
Between you and Dekeman. Although it probably is about time we look at doing a new OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

03:13:01.160 --> 03:13:05.160
Because there's so much. Now that we have VOG Network, there's so much on the old site we don't really use.

03:13:05.160 --> 03:13:10.160
So we need to trim it back a little bit and get those Chinese spammers out of there. Bastards.

03:13:10.160 --> 03:13:12.160
Anyway, your final thought, sir.

03:13:12.160 --> 03:13:15.160
Wow, what is my final thought?

03:13:15.160 --> 03:13:24.160
Hurry to driving. Another 14 hours next Saturday, plus the two hours tonight to get back to San Francisco.

03:13:24.160 --> 03:13:26.160
It's nice. It's a wonderful drive.

03:13:26.160 --> 03:13:28.160
Are you driving to Phoenix next Saturday?

03:13:28.160 --> 03:13:30.160
Yeah, I'm out of here. I'm driving to Phoenix.

03:13:30.160 --> 03:13:33.160
I almost was going to be doing that same drive.

03:13:33.160 --> 03:13:35.160
Yeah, you mentioned it earlier. I was like, ooh, hello.

03:13:35.160 --> 03:13:39.160
Yeah, I'm going to Arizona for at least a week next Saturday.

03:13:39.160 --> 03:13:43.160
And the funny thing is I might even be back in San Francisco the following week.

03:13:43.160 --> 03:13:46.160
And then I have to figure out what my Thanksgiving plans are going to be.

03:13:46.160 --> 03:13:52.160
But if I do come back to San Francisco, that means I'm going to do the 22 hour drive I-80 back home.

03:13:52.160 --> 03:13:54.160
Because that's the only one that makes sense.

03:13:54.160 --> 03:13:56.160
Well, maybe we'll see you right back here on OLR next month.

03:13:56.160 --> 03:13:57.160
Quite possibly.

03:13:57.160 --> 03:14:00.160
You're always welcome at the house anytime, Jason.

03:14:00.160 --> 03:14:04.160
All right. Let's see. How about Dark Sakura? Your final thought.

03:14:04.160 --> 03:14:05.160
Animal Crossing.

03:14:05.160 --> 03:14:06.160
Man, there's... no.

03:14:06.160 --> 03:14:07.160
Ed, move out.

03:14:07.160 --> 03:14:08.160
Fuck Ed.

03:14:08.160 --> 03:14:09.160
That's the final thought.

03:14:09.160 --> 03:14:16.160
I'm absolutely irritated and I'm just having now all three characters in my village ignore Ed.

03:14:16.160 --> 03:14:18.160
Because fuck him.

03:14:18.160 --> 03:14:21.160
Not really, because he's disgusting.

03:14:21.160 --> 03:14:24.160
I'm sorry, you don't wear purple eyeshadow when you're blue.

03:14:24.160 --> 03:14:26.160
It just doesn't work.

03:14:26.160 --> 03:14:27.160
And you don't give people jackhammers.

03:14:27.160 --> 03:14:29.160
I'll tell all the Smurfs I know your fashion tips.

03:14:29.160 --> 03:14:31.160
You know what? Okay.

03:14:31.160 --> 03:14:36.160
No, mine is... this has been the night for nostalgia.

03:14:36.160 --> 03:14:39.160
Because, you know, Pokemon and rival schools.

03:14:39.160 --> 03:14:41.160
But then, Ikuma.

03:14:41.160 --> 03:14:45.160
You are wonderful, Ikuma-san, but you had to mention Last Blade.

03:14:45.160 --> 03:14:48.160
And I love that series.

03:14:48.160 --> 03:14:51.160
So, I want a new Last Blade game, too.

03:14:51.160 --> 03:14:54.160
My final thought tonight is fuck this headache.

03:14:54.160 --> 03:14:59.160
And bless that bottle of wine that I'm going to get to open because Alan was able to get home.

03:14:59.160 --> 03:15:01.160
Because you want a bigger headache.

03:15:01.160 --> 03:15:02.160
That's right.

03:15:02.160 --> 03:15:05.160
Thank you, Alan, for running and making light rail.

03:15:05.160 --> 03:15:07.160
He can't hear me. He has headphones on.

03:15:07.160 --> 03:15:08.160
Alright.

03:15:08.160 --> 03:15:10.160
Oh no, here he is.

03:15:10.160 --> 03:15:12.160
He came out and said you're welcome. Thank you, Alan.

03:15:12.160 --> 03:15:14.160
Rob, we bread.

03:15:14.160 --> 03:15:16.160
Finally. Yay, Jamie, we mated.

03:15:16.160 --> 03:15:18.160
Wait. Scratch that.

03:15:18.160 --> 03:15:19.160
Loki, last but not least.

03:15:19.160 --> 03:15:21.160
No, we breed puzzle pieces, remember?

03:15:21.160 --> 03:15:23.160
Loki, last but not least. Your final thought.

03:15:23.160 --> 03:15:29.160
My final thought is I'm still acquiring pieces for my portable screen thing.

03:15:29.160 --> 03:15:33.160
I've actually been using that screen quite a bit at work because that's what we play.

03:15:33.160 --> 03:15:38.160
It's what I play on my PlayStation 3, so it's working out really good.

03:15:38.160 --> 03:15:45.160
And I'm now trying to find an audio amp, which I'm going to go with an old USB speaker.

03:15:45.160 --> 03:15:48.160
And the battery, which I have one picked out already.

03:15:48.160 --> 03:15:52.160
And now a DC-DC converter.

03:15:53.160 --> 03:15:58.160
And then I just need to design a case and vacuum form that bitch.

03:15:58.160 --> 03:15:59.160
Which will be hard.

03:15:59.160 --> 03:16:00.160
Good luck.

03:16:00.160 --> 03:16:02.160
The Virtual Boy looks so weird.

03:16:02.160 --> 03:16:04.160
I love my Virtual Boy hat. I love it.

03:16:04.160 --> 03:16:06.160
Alright, that's really it. We're done. We're out of here.

03:16:06.160 --> 03:16:08.160
Thank you guys very much for listening to our show.

03:16:08.160 --> 03:16:10.160
We'll be back next week to do it all again.

03:16:10.160 --> 03:16:12.160
Episode 526.

03:16:12.160 --> 03:16:14.160
Until then, Jason, take us out.

03:16:14.160 --> 03:16:18.160
