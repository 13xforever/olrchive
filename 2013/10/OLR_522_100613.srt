1
00:00:14,164 --> 00:00:15,646
[SPEAKER_05]: All this and more begins right now.

2
00:00:31,331 --> 00:00:32,211
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura or Jamie Summers

3
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:02,301
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's not on.

4
00:01:02,381 --> 00:01:02,841
[SPEAKER_03]: Now it's on.

5
00:01:02,881 --> 00:01:04,042
[SPEAKER_03]: Did I do my math right?

6
00:01:04,983 --> 00:01:05,884
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care.

7
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:08,867
[SPEAKER_10]: Math sucks.

8
00:01:09,247 --> 00:01:10,248
[SPEAKER_10]: Why are you meh?

9
00:01:10,328 --> 00:01:11,309
[SPEAKER_10]: Sunday is fun day.

10
00:01:11,789 --> 00:01:15,632
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I'm waiting for Halloween to be over so I can buy Purim costumes.

11
00:01:16,933 --> 00:01:17,414
[SPEAKER_10]: Fair enough.

12
00:01:18,792 --> 00:01:23,674
[SPEAKER_04]: and then get all the candy on sale and then make candy corn muffins or something.

13
00:01:24,514 --> 00:01:30,976
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I am planning, even though I'm not doing sugar very much, I'm planning on making candy corn vodka.

14
00:01:31,116 --> 00:01:31,676
[SPEAKER_10]: Hooray!

15
00:01:32,497 --> 00:01:33,437
[SPEAKER_10]: Vodka doesn't count.

16
00:01:35,373 --> 00:01:35,833
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

17
00:02:04,867 --> 00:02:08,149
[SPEAKER_10]: and then Candy Corn and it's like Candy Corn Oreos and like all this.

18
00:02:08,549 --> 00:02:14,252
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the time of year that I actually make my I kind of call it gourd soup.

19
00:02:15,072 --> 00:02:18,634
[SPEAKER_04]: But I make a butternut squash, pumpkin and sweet potato soup.

20
00:02:19,635 --> 00:02:20,095
[SPEAKER_10]: Yummy.

21
00:02:20,595 --> 00:02:21,956
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's really creamy.

22
00:02:22,036 --> 00:02:24,397
[SPEAKER_04]: But now the way that I make these is I make them all savory.

23
00:02:24,497 --> 00:02:30,400
[SPEAKER_04]: So I put like garlic and rosemary and all kinds of savory herbs in it so that it's sweet and savory at the same time.

24
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:32,601
[SPEAKER_04]: And you guys, she's going to bring some to the next show.

25
00:02:32,701 --> 00:02:33,041
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay!

26
00:02:33,081 --> 00:02:34,101
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe I will.

27
00:02:34,261 --> 00:02:36,222
[SPEAKER_04]: I've actually got the stuff to make my soup.

28
00:02:36,842 --> 00:02:42,023
[SPEAKER_04]: And this time I have purple mountain yams to add in it this time.

29
00:02:42,603 --> 00:02:43,504
[SPEAKER_10]: This sounds delicious.

30
00:02:43,604 --> 00:02:44,164
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't wait.

31
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:45,484
[SPEAKER_10]: All the listeners are hungry now.

32
00:02:45,644 --> 00:02:50,966
[SPEAKER_04]: But everybody should be jealous of my amazing dinner because I had rabbit and beef liver for dinner.

33
00:02:50,986 --> 00:02:52,066
[SPEAKER_04]: Poor Bugs Bunny.

34
00:02:52,586 --> 00:02:53,506
[SPEAKER_04]: Too Much Fucking Pumpkin, Yo

35
00:03:13,573 --> 00:03:17,315
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, even our chatters have wrong opinions sometimes here at Orange Lounge Radio.

36
00:03:17,575 --> 00:03:20,156
[SPEAKER_10]: But after all, it is the show where every gamer has a voice.

37
00:03:20,256 --> 00:03:20,976
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't like pumpkin.

38
00:03:21,076 --> 00:03:22,677
[SPEAKER_10]: And there he is, Tech Master Loki.

39
00:03:22,777 --> 00:03:23,698
[SPEAKER_10]: What's wrong with you?

40
00:03:24,098 --> 00:03:24,818
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't like pumpkin.

41
00:03:24,858 --> 00:03:25,939
[SPEAKER_10]: You don't like pumpkin?

42
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:26,239
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

43
00:03:26,559 --> 00:03:26,819
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

44
00:03:26,859 --> 00:03:29,680
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, some people think I'm weird because I don't like mayonnaise.

45
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,921
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think I introduced myself.

46
00:03:31,001 --> 00:03:32,001
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm Rob Roberts, by the way.

47
00:03:32,081 --> 00:03:33,942
[SPEAKER_10]: If you don't know me, I'm Rob Roberts, and I hate mayonnaise.

48
00:03:33,962 --> 00:03:37,764
[SPEAKER_07]: I can understand eating straight up mayonnaise, but on a sandwich is fine.

49
00:03:38,184 --> 00:03:38,984
[SPEAKER_07]: As long as it's not cooked.

50
00:03:39,004 --> 00:03:39,505
[SPEAKER_12]: Or tuna salad.

51
00:03:39,785 --> 00:03:40,045
[SPEAKER_12]: Mm-mm.

52
00:03:40,505 --> 00:03:43,289
[SPEAKER_04]: or Chicken Salad or everything with mayonnaise.

53
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:51,882
[SPEAKER_10]: Last night, Alan and I went and got sushi and we got this one roll and I was kind of like, I think that's a mayo-based sauce and I'm going to have to kind of like eat the edges.

54
00:03:52,685 --> 00:03:53,025
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

55
00:03:53,085 --> 00:03:58,531
[SPEAKER_04]: I got sushi the other day and I had an allergic reaction to it because you know what was mixed in with the crab?

56
00:03:58,691 --> 00:03:58,951
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

57
00:03:58,991 --> 00:03:59,492
[SPEAKER_04]: Sriracha.

58
00:04:00,473 --> 00:04:00,913
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh no.

59
00:04:01,093 --> 00:04:02,215
[SPEAKER_10]: Sriracha crab?

60
00:04:02,275 --> 00:04:02,635
[SPEAKER_10]: That's weird.

61
00:04:02,715 --> 00:04:04,297
[SPEAKER_04]: It was how they made their spicy crab.

62
00:04:05,137 --> 00:04:13,946
[SPEAKER_04]: They mixed sriracha in with the crab and normally I'm fine with spicy crab because it's just like maybe a little, you know, something else hot but they mixed sriracha in it which I'm like stupidly allergic to.

63
00:04:14,767 --> 00:04:16,569
[SPEAKER_04]: So I actually still have a hive and it hurts.

64
00:04:17,969 --> 00:04:18,310
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see.

65
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:21,471
[SPEAKER_10]: Going to Ragenator in our chatroom says pumpkin flavored mayonnaise.

66
00:04:21,911 --> 00:04:22,351
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry.

67
00:04:22,391 --> 00:04:23,212
[SPEAKER_10]: That won't work for me.

68
00:04:23,412 --> 00:04:25,012
[SPEAKER_10]: Just like it probably won't work for Loki.

69
00:04:26,593 --> 00:04:27,433
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not okay.

70
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:28,994
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, here's the thing.

71
00:04:29,034 --> 00:04:33,816
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't understand putting mayonnaise on hot things.

72
00:04:33,876 --> 00:04:34,876
[SPEAKER_07]: With a sandwich, it's okay.

73
00:04:35,096 --> 00:04:41,619
[SPEAKER_07]: But people put it on burgers or they'll get a sandwich at a sandwich place and they're like, yeah, I'd like that toasted.

74
00:04:42,019 --> 00:04:43,280
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, okay, cool.

75
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,360
[SPEAKER_07]: Now it's like this nasty.

76
00:04:45,121 --> 00:05:04,337
[SPEAKER_10]: I am literally gagging right now and I don't mean like fashion runway I'm gagging at that I mean like I am actually about to barf when you're talking about that I won't tell you about what my mom used to eat as a snack no canned pears with mayonnaise and cheese I actually grew up on that it's pretty good all right look we need to talk about video games

77
00:05:04,602 --> 00:05:07,543
[SPEAKER_07]: What about a mayonnaise-flavored flurry or something like that?

78
00:05:08,124 --> 00:05:08,704
[SPEAKER_03]: What's wrong with you people?

79
00:05:08,724 --> 00:05:11,465
[SPEAKER_03]: I like homemade mayonnaise as a garnish on dishes.

80
00:05:11,585 --> 00:05:16,127
[SPEAKER_10]: Look, be nice to everybody and respectful, because we've got a guest here in studio tonight.

81
00:05:16,547 --> 00:05:18,108
[SPEAKER_10]: I bet she likes mayonnaise.

82
00:05:18,148 --> 00:05:18,548
[SPEAKER_10]: She might.

83
00:05:18,948 --> 00:05:20,289
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to say hello to our guest here.

84
00:05:20,509 --> 00:05:26,612
[SPEAKER_10]: It's actually her second time on the show, but welcome back, as the case may be, to Shell is here tonight.

85
00:05:27,112 --> 00:05:28,133
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much for having me

86
00:05:56,949 --> 00:05:58,529
[SPEAKER_10]: I think this happened after you were on the show.

87
00:05:58,549 --> 00:05:58,930
[SPEAKER_10]: Have you seen it?

88
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:00,430
[SPEAKER_10]: It's on Wii U Virtual Console now.

89
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:01,911
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I did not.

90
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:05,293
[SPEAKER_10]: I could get that puppy over here right now for you to check out.

91
00:06:05,353 --> 00:06:06,333
[SPEAKER_10]: It's awesome.

92
00:06:06,573 --> 00:06:07,294
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be awesome.

93
00:06:07,474 --> 00:06:09,515
[SPEAKER_10]: I need to play more of it, to be honest.

94
00:06:09,835 --> 00:06:11,415
[SPEAKER_10]: Have you checked out anything lately?

95
00:06:11,456 --> 00:06:16,498
[SPEAKER_10]: I know we're going to get into gaming weeks a little later, but what kind of stuff have you been into in general as of late?

96
00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:23,193
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, since I've been busy, I've been getting my nostalgia on with old LucasArts stuff and a lot of free RPG stuff.

97
00:06:23,313 --> 00:06:23,653
[SPEAKER_08]: Fair enough.

98
00:06:23,853 --> 00:06:34,119
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, you know, you people light up my life with your independent RPGs that are fan-made stuff, but at the same time, guys, sometimes you need to work on your programming.

99
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:40,944
[SPEAKER_11]: Because, you know, I want to meet you halfway, but when I noclip into a shelf, yeah...

100
00:06:41,644 --> 00:06:43,185
[SPEAKER_10]: There's such good stuff out there, though.

101
00:06:43,246 --> 00:06:50,512
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, there are a lot of great indie RPGs, and the great thing about RPGs is that they're a great time, they take forever to beat, usually, so they're a great time scene.

102
00:06:50,772 --> 00:06:53,074
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm thinking of things like, you know, Cthulhu Saves the World.

103
00:06:53,335 --> 00:06:54,415
[SPEAKER_10]: Have you played any of that stuff?

104
00:06:54,676 --> 00:06:54,936
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

105
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:55,296
[SPEAKER_10]: Adorbs.

106
00:06:56,257 --> 00:06:56,758
[SPEAKER_10]: Adorbs.

107
00:06:56,938 --> 00:06:58,499
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you have, are you a Steam user?

108
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,361
[SPEAKER_11]: Not really so much, no.

109
00:07:00,421 --> 00:07:03,083
[SPEAKER_11]: My computer's broke as hell, and it's also four years old.

110
00:07:03,544 --> 00:07:06,146
[SPEAKER_11]: It's doing some interesting breakage right now, in fact.

111
00:07:07,678 --> 00:07:10,340
[SPEAKER_10]: If you're able to put some band-aids on it, check out Steam.

112
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:12,501
[SPEAKER_10]: Some of these indie RPGs are like $1.50.

113
00:07:13,021 --> 00:07:16,042
[SPEAKER_10]: They go on sale.

114
00:07:16,182 --> 00:07:20,344
[SPEAKER_10]: There'll be a winter sale, as there always is, going into New Year's and such this year.

115
00:07:20,364 --> 00:07:24,106
[SPEAKER_10]: It'll be like, hand us a couple quarters and here's like 50 games.

116
00:07:24,306 --> 00:07:25,508
[SPEAKER_07]: Sales all the things.

117
00:07:25,608 --> 00:07:26,329
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.

118
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:27,290
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.

119
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:31,857
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't forget there's something we're bringing up in Part B for people who are not on Steam.

120
00:07:31,977 --> 00:07:32,437
[SPEAKER_10]: Absolutely.

121
00:07:32,457 --> 00:07:33,118
[SPEAKER_10]: A little teaser.

122
00:07:33,138 --> 00:07:34,040
[SPEAKER_10]: A little teaser.

123
00:07:34,701 --> 00:07:37,625
[SPEAKER_10]: So Chell will have to pay attention in Part B. There will be a quiz tonight.

124
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:38,506
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if they told you.

125
00:07:38,966 --> 00:07:39,748
[SPEAKER_10]: There will be a quiz.

126
00:07:40,008 --> 00:07:41,330
[SPEAKER_10]: What other stuff do you do for fun, Chell?

127
00:07:42,288 --> 00:07:43,549
[SPEAKER_11]: I haven't been doing much fun lately.

128
00:07:44,149 --> 00:07:56,114
[SPEAKER_11]: I've mostly been working on just getting stuff for my degree together and working on a lot of learning 3D stuff because one day I hope to join the unwashed masses and start churning out games like I want to play.

129
00:07:56,494 --> 00:07:56,954
[SPEAKER_10]: Awesome.

130
00:07:57,535 --> 00:08:00,536
[SPEAKER_10]: Have you thought about what would be your dream company to work for?

131
00:08:01,431 --> 00:08:04,233
[SPEAKER_11]: Rob doesn't usually ask stupid questions, haha, or at least I had to tell myself, but that one was pretty dumb.

132
00:08:04,253 --> 00:08:08,437
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not just that they make games that I want to play, it's that they seem like a really chill workforce.

133
00:08:21,047 --> 00:08:24,790
[SPEAKER_10]: Have you seen that leaked handbook that's online?

134
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:28,433
[SPEAKER_10]: That's like the Valve company handbook, like what the employees get.

135
00:08:28,853 --> 00:08:33,297
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, their corporate culture is so interesting at Valve.

136
00:08:33,997 --> 00:08:34,878
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just so neat.

137
00:08:35,018 --> 00:08:41,363
[SPEAKER_10]: And I kind of think about, gosh, if they try to do something like that at my day job, I don't know if something like that would fly.

138
00:08:41,443 --> 00:08:45,387
[SPEAKER_10]: Some industries need structure, but it's so interesting as Valve has really pulled off this

139
00:08:46,147 --> 00:08:47,228
[SPEAKER_10]: Everybody's equal.

140
00:08:47,589 --> 00:08:48,630
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't have titles.

141
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:54,276
[SPEAKER_10]: Your desk is on wheels, and you roll it where you need to go, and we don't tell you what to do.

142
00:08:54,396 --> 00:08:55,978
[SPEAKER_10]: You find projects.

143
00:08:57,380 --> 00:09:00,043
[SPEAKER_10]: You guys have to Google this if you've never seen this before, the Valve handbook.

144
00:09:00,503 --> 00:09:04,407
[SPEAKER_10]: Technically, I don't know if it's legit or not, but it seems like it would be.

145
00:09:04,848 --> 00:09:05,909
[SPEAKER_10]: I have no reason to doubt it.

146
00:09:06,069 --> 00:09:07,130
[SPEAKER_11]: Sounds pretty close, yeah.

147
00:09:07,911 --> 00:09:16,599
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's just like so interesting that, you know, a person might start work at this company and they don't have any assignments.

148
00:09:16,619 --> 00:09:18,761
[SPEAKER_10]: So they just have to go like find something to do.

149
00:09:19,322 --> 00:09:21,063
[SPEAKER_10]: But that's the type of people they're looking for.

150
00:09:21,284 --> 00:09:22,145
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, work raising.

151
00:09:22,425 --> 00:09:23,085
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, so...

152
00:09:23,926 --> 00:09:24,306
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

153
00:09:24,406 --> 00:09:28,209
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, unfortunately, as we're broadcasting live here, we're having a little bit of stream troubles.

154
00:09:28,589 --> 00:09:34,232
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to keep going for the sake of the podcast, but for some reason, we're not actually able to reconnect.

155
00:09:34,493 --> 00:09:42,237
[SPEAKER_10]: And what's going on is actually on server room side because we are not able to reconnect at all.

156
00:09:42,778 --> 00:09:47,500
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm going to try to keep this show going while doing tech at the same time.

157
00:09:49,442 --> 00:09:49,882
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

158
00:09:50,922 --> 00:09:52,543
[SPEAKER_10]: I... Well, you know what?

159
00:09:53,163 --> 00:09:56,724
[SPEAKER_03]: We could go and bring up our next topic.

160
00:09:57,144 --> 00:09:57,584
[SPEAKER_10]: We could.

161
00:09:58,005 --> 00:10:07,148
[SPEAKER_10]: Or I have another idea, too, is that since this is for the sake of the podcast, why don't we do a quick musical interlude while we try to fix things, and then we'll be right back.

162
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:07,748
[SPEAKER_03]: I could sing.

163
00:10:08,088 --> 00:10:08,428
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

164
00:10:08,688 --> 00:10:09,428
[SPEAKER_10]: You want to sing us out?

165
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:11,709
[SPEAKER_03]: Fly me to the moon.

166
00:10:11,869 --> 00:10:12,009
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

167
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:19,572
[SPEAKER_05]: To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase dash.

168
00:10:20,194 --> 00:10:21,194
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, we're back.

169
00:10:21,274 --> 00:10:31,619
[SPEAKER_10]: That wasn't awkward or anything, but the joys of doing live radio is that sometimes the feed just, the internets go down, there's a server reboot or something happens.

170
00:10:32,359 --> 00:10:33,320
[SPEAKER_10]: The tubes untube.

171
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,801
[SPEAKER_10]: The tubes get untied or I don't know what happens.

172
00:10:35,821 --> 00:10:36,961
[SPEAKER_04]: Or it's just being a butthole.

173
00:10:37,201 --> 00:10:39,062
[SPEAKER_10]: Or a cat just pulled out the plug.

174
00:10:39,142 --> 00:10:41,323
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's be real, that's probably what happened.

175
00:10:41,363 --> 00:10:44,024
[SPEAKER_10]: But for once, that wasn't our fault, at least I can say.

176
00:10:44,484 --> 00:10:45,425
[SPEAKER_10]: So, alright.

177
00:10:46,585 --> 00:10:47,826
[SPEAKER_10]: Where were we when we left off?

178
00:10:48,047 --> 00:10:52,931
[SPEAKER_10]: I was talking to the lovely Chelle over there about the dream company she wanted to work for.

179
00:10:53,031 --> 00:10:58,436
[SPEAKER_10]: We were talking about Valve and just kind of what a different type of company Valve is.

180
00:10:58,857 --> 00:10:59,938
[SPEAKER_10]: So let me ask you this.

181
00:11:00,038 --> 00:11:08,426
[SPEAKER_10]: Knowing that the employees at Valve can work on whatever project they want, if you were to get hired by Valve, hypothetically, what would be your dream project?

182
00:11:09,677 --> 00:11:11,159
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, Barring Half-Life Part 3.

183
00:11:13,201 --> 00:11:14,262
[SPEAKER_10]: Which may or may not be a thing.

184
00:11:14,322 --> 00:11:15,263
[SPEAKER_10]: Make sure that mic's on, by the way.

185
00:11:15,363 --> 00:11:16,304
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, yeah.

186
00:11:16,545 --> 00:11:16,945
[SPEAKER_11]: Sibilance.

187
00:11:17,145 --> 00:11:17,506
[SPEAKER_11]: Sibilance.

188
00:11:17,526 --> 00:11:17,926
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right.

189
00:11:18,707 --> 00:11:19,988
[SPEAKER_10]: So, Barring Half-Life Part 3.

190
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:23,292
[SPEAKER_11]: Ooh, ooh, ooh, that is a tough one.

191
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:31,141
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, you know, I really always wanted to, you know, obviously see a Portal sequel, but I just want to work on something just really new and fresh coming down the pipe that...

192
00:11:32,021 --> 00:11:34,784
[SPEAKER_11]: They kind of hit me where I live, story-wise.

193
00:11:34,844 --> 00:11:40,729
[SPEAKER_11]: Everything they put out is just right along the lines of what I try to bring into my fiction.

194
00:11:41,109 --> 00:11:47,715
[SPEAKER_11]: The continuing themes of being alone in a strange place and having to survive through strange circumstances.

195
00:11:48,844 --> 00:11:51,125
[SPEAKER_10]: You are a little quiet, by the way, so just make sure you tap right in that mic.

196
00:11:51,165 --> 00:11:52,285
[SPEAKER_10]: No, that's okay.

197
00:11:52,425 --> 00:11:58,746
[SPEAKER_10]: So you would hope to work on Half-Life 3 or something kind of new, because I'm a little fancy.

198
00:11:59,127 --> 00:12:03,648
[SPEAKER_10]: Speaking of new and fancy, Valve did make a bunch of announcements last week about this Steam box.

199
00:12:03,988 --> 00:12:05,168
[SPEAKER_10]: Have you been following this news at all?

200
00:12:05,248 --> 00:12:08,389
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I'm completely out of the loop during the school year.

201
00:12:09,449 --> 00:12:11,171
[SPEAKER_10]: That's why we're here, to help you stay current.

202
00:12:11,752 --> 00:12:17,257
[SPEAKER_10]: The Steam Box, they announced, is it's going to have its own operating system, SteamOS, which you can put on any computer.

203
00:12:17,538 --> 00:12:18,859
[SPEAKER_10]: It's basically a version of Linux.

204
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:28,389
[SPEAKER_10]: And then they're going to be selling these computers that are basically... It's kind of to rival consoles a little bit, to bring PC gaming closer to the living room, but there'll be all these different types.

205
00:12:28,409 --> 00:12:29,871
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no way there are going to be console prices.

206
00:12:30,191 --> 00:12:31,332
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki's shaking his head over there.

207
00:12:31,372 --> 00:12:32,033
[SPEAKER_07]: No way, huh?

208
00:12:32,261 --> 00:12:32,781
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

209
00:12:51,653 --> 00:12:52,053
[SPEAKER_07]: Like that.

210
00:12:52,073 --> 00:12:52,574
[SPEAKER_07]: Seriously.

211
00:12:52,654 --> 00:12:56,036
[SPEAKER_07]: Even the low end was like a, I think like a 680, you know.

212
00:12:56,136 --> 00:12:58,998
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, that's still way better than I've got now.

213
00:12:59,198 --> 00:12:59,498
[SPEAKER_10]: Nice.

214
00:13:00,258 --> 00:13:03,060
[SPEAKER_10]: And WhatUpG says, how about that new controller for the Steam box?

215
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:07,783
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, don't forget there is that little controller too with the fancy little, it's really kind of weird.

216
00:13:07,843 --> 00:13:09,644
[SPEAKER_10]: It's got like thumbsticks, but they're like touchpads.

217
00:13:09,944 --> 00:13:10,745
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's neat.

218
00:13:11,325 --> 00:13:12,085
[SPEAKER_10]: It's interesting.

219
00:13:12,145 --> 00:13:12,646
[SPEAKER_10]: It's different.

220
00:13:13,006 --> 00:13:14,547
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, it's not the same old, same old, so.

221
00:13:15,287 --> 00:13:18,609
[SPEAKER_11]: Anything with a million joysticks makes me want to hiss and run into a corner.

222
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:22,732
[SPEAKER_11]: That's one of my main issues with... One of my continuing issues with Xbox.

223
00:13:22,932 --> 00:13:29,396
[SPEAKER_10]: Remember when Nintendo announced the Wii and they came out with that Wiimote and a lot of people were like, it's really simple.

224
00:13:29,576 --> 00:13:31,257
[SPEAKER_10]: And Nintendo was like, that's the point.

225
00:13:31,618 --> 00:13:35,840
[SPEAKER_10]: So many people are intimidated by all the buttons, like on an Xbox or a PlayStation controller.

226
00:13:36,441 --> 00:13:42,565
[SPEAKER_10]: The nice thing about the Wii controller is that, yes, there's some smaller buttons, but for a lot of people, there's just one big giant button

227
00:13:43,545 --> 00:13:45,246
[SPEAKER_10]: That says A, and then the little trigger thing.

228
00:13:45,266 --> 00:13:47,848
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's why so many senior citizens do the bowling and all that, you know?

229
00:13:47,888 --> 00:13:51,690
[SPEAKER_04]: You think they learned from the clusterfuck that was the N64 controller?

230
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:54,291
[SPEAKER_11]: Which was a good controller, but still.

231
00:13:54,331 --> 00:13:55,552
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, exactly.

232
00:13:55,952 --> 00:14:00,815
[SPEAKER_11]: It gives me horrible, horrible flashbacks to Rebel Alliance N64.

233
00:14:00,975 --> 00:14:06,058
[SPEAKER_11]: My brother having me help hold down all the buttons so he can just... Oh, God.

234
00:14:06,998 --> 00:14:07,378
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

235
00:14:07,418 --> 00:14:10,820
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, Chow, we'll be talking to you about the news and such throughout the show.

236
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:14,861
[SPEAKER_10]: Please feel free to chime in as you like to have your say on whatever's going on.

237
00:14:15,282 --> 00:14:19,383
[SPEAKER_10]: And those of you in chat room, same thing for you guys, live.vognetwork.com.

238
00:14:19,804 --> 00:14:22,765
[SPEAKER_10]: And Actdeft says, Loki, that's only for the prototypes.

239
00:14:23,825 --> 00:14:27,727
[SPEAKER_10]: Actdeft says, the retail version of the Steam Machine will probably offer lower specs.

240
00:14:28,058 --> 00:14:29,139
[SPEAKER_07]: I want the world, I want the whole world

241
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:43,779
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

242
00:14:44,861 --> 00:14:51,309
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to do a quick kickoff topic here, and we are running a little behind because of the live stuff, so I'll just quickly talk about tonight's... I know, right?

243
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:53,112
[SPEAKER_10]: We're only ever here for like four hours.

244
00:14:54,513 --> 00:15:01,162
[SPEAKER_10]: This is going to be a big week in gaming, whether Loki wants to admit it or not, because Saturday, October 12th, sees the release of...

245
00:15:01,943 --> 00:15:04,765
[SPEAKER_10]: Pokemon X and Y!

246
00:15:05,886 --> 00:15:07,347
[SPEAKER_10]: You're not a Pokemon fan.

247
00:15:07,547 --> 00:15:07,788
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

248
00:15:07,968 --> 00:15:08,668
[SPEAKER_10]: Why not?

249
00:15:09,209 --> 00:15:13,832
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I have other things to like, like free time.

250
00:15:14,853 --> 00:15:16,654
[SPEAKER_10]: I see, I see, I see.

251
00:15:16,694 --> 00:15:22,599
[SPEAKER_10]: So you value your time so much that you don't want to get sucked into Pokemon because you see how Pokemon ruins lives.

252
00:15:23,041 --> 00:15:24,002
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, thanks, Shane.

253
00:15:26,203 --> 00:15:32,586
[SPEAKER_04]: No, the last one I played was Pearl, and I only ever played it at the gym, which was ironic because I was going to gyms.

254
00:15:33,046 --> 00:15:33,687
[SPEAKER_04]: At the gym!

255
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:40,844
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know why that's so funny, but I'm laughing.

256
00:15:40,904 --> 00:15:42,085
[SPEAKER_06]: You're a dog I hear like Jim.

257
00:15:43,587 --> 00:15:46,671
[SPEAKER_04]: So here's a Pokemon, Jim, so you can go to the gym at your gym.

258
00:15:48,033 --> 00:15:52,859
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be funny because if I were a dude, I could be Jim because I'm Jamie.

259
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:54,280
[SPEAKER_04]: Ha ha.

260
00:15:55,021 --> 00:15:55,943
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my god, stop.

261
00:15:58,106 --> 00:16:00,088
[SPEAKER_02]: So... Rob's red.

262
00:16:00,149 --> 00:16:00,389
[SPEAKER_02]: It's awesome.

263
00:16:00,409 --> 00:16:01,130
[SPEAKER_10]: So you just skipped?

264
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:04,034
[SPEAKER_10]: This is like one of those nights where just anything's funny.

265
00:16:04,134 --> 00:16:04,595
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry.

266
00:16:04,955 --> 00:16:08,100
[SPEAKER_10]: Because there's probably people out there listening going, Rob, it wasn't that funny.

267
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,862
[SPEAKER_10]: Rob, it's not that funny.

268
00:16:10,643 --> 00:16:11,024
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki's

269
00:16:11,945 --> 00:16:12,665
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, hater.

270
00:16:13,426 --> 00:16:15,787
[SPEAKER_10]: Why are you hating on the Pokemon?

271
00:16:16,188 --> 00:16:17,248
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not a series I'm into.

272
00:16:17,508 --> 00:16:22,012
[SPEAKER_07]: And don't get me wrong, I understand that there are fans of it, and I'm not saying there's anything wrong with those fans.

273
00:16:22,352 --> 00:16:29,677
[SPEAKER_07]: I was just thinking, you know, that's probably why they have Shane working at a certain company, because he is the crack dealer for getting people into any game.

274
00:16:30,398 --> 00:16:47,417
[SPEAKER_10]: and you know they have him behind you know Pokemon well I've said this on Horde House is that Shane was born to do sales and I'd like that's that's where his ultimate calling is going to end up being someday but this is stop making this the Shane show I'm sure he's listening very happy that we're talking Pokemon and all this but

275
00:16:47,785 --> 00:16:48,945
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I don't understand it.

276
00:16:48,985 --> 00:16:52,826
[SPEAKER_07]: And honestly, to me, this looks like the way I look at a Madden release.

277
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:54,267
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, oh, cool.

278
00:16:54,607 --> 00:16:58,528
[SPEAKER_07]: Instead of colors this time, it's X and Y. Cool.

279
00:16:59,148 --> 00:17:03,609
[SPEAKER_07]: And that means nothing to me other than I assume that there's just going to be a few more Pokemon.

280
00:17:05,209 --> 00:17:12,451
[SPEAKER_07]: And you have to collect those to add to your ever-large collection of Pokemon that you battle each other for whatever reason.

281
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:13,131
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't understand.

282
00:17:14,538 --> 00:17:22,385
[SPEAKER_11]: If you are moving in that direction, I'm kind of disappointed that there is an opportunity to go in the other chromosomes so you get Pokemons with some autosomal disorders.

283
00:17:23,046 --> 00:17:27,970
[SPEAKER_11]: You've got the Down Syndrome Pokemon that you have to help a little out, but he's punching for you.

284
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:29,171
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, he's pulling for you.

285
00:17:29,511 --> 00:17:31,893
[SPEAKER_11]: That would have taken gaming into a whole new area.

286
00:17:33,074 --> 00:17:34,436
[SPEAKER_03]: What about Aspie Pokemon?

287
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:34,896
Yeah.

288
00:17:35,657 --> 00:17:39,260
[SPEAKER_03]: Where they take everything really literal and then, yeah.

289
00:17:41,207 --> 00:18:02,132
[SPEAKER_10]: and I'm allowed to say that so I'm looking at our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com and Actdeft says Jim at the gym Jimception alright need to go down another level let's see Blackwolf says Loki's not into Pokemon because it's not Grand Theft Auto

290
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:09,963
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, to be fair, we had a discussion last week where Jamie's like, I'm not that into Grand Theft Auto, and now this week it's, I'm not that into Pokemon.

291
00:18:09,983 --> 00:18:21,789
[SPEAKER_07]: And to be fair, like, if they had some sort of mini-game in Grand Theft Auto where you had to, like, raise dogs and fight them or something, you know, the Michael Vick of, you know, the Pokemon, you know, world, I still probably wouldn't play that because that sounds stupid.

292
00:18:21,849 --> 00:18:31,353
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just, I don't know, I just don't, I'm not into that type of game where you, especially if it has to do with raising stuff, I mean, and I blame Nintendogs for that because fuck that, that made...

293
00:18:31,873 --> 00:18:34,934
[SPEAKER_07]: Any sort of raising of anything is extremely boring.

294
00:18:34,974 --> 00:18:36,534
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, cute puppies, what's wrong with that?

295
00:18:36,914 --> 00:18:39,455
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, everything, because have you raised a dog before?

296
00:18:40,235 --> 00:18:44,236
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not all petting and playing Frisbee and stuff.

297
00:18:44,256 --> 00:18:46,256
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to fucking feed that shit, wash it.

298
00:18:46,316 --> 00:18:48,316
[SPEAKER_07]: You're going to be cleaning poop all day.

299
00:18:48,356 --> 00:18:50,797
[SPEAKER_07]: They just want attention all goddamn hours of the day.

300
00:18:50,857 --> 00:18:55,678
[SPEAKER_04]: Come to think of it, right after I quit WoW was after the whole Pokemon mode came out.

301
00:18:56,318 --> 00:18:58,739
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe that has something to do with it, too.

302
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:02,360
[SPEAKER_10]: To Loki's thing, they put Pokemon in WoW.

303
00:19:02,501 --> 00:19:02,841
[SPEAKER_10]: That did happen.

304
00:19:02,881 --> 00:19:03,621
[SPEAKER_04]: And I quit.

305
00:19:06,042 --> 00:19:07,903
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought we all quit because of LFR.

306
00:19:08,003 --> 00:19:09,283
[SPEAKER_10]: That was the real reason, anyway.

307
00:19:10,764 --> 00:19:12,565
[SPEAKER_04]: I liked LFR, to be honest.

308
00:19:13,285 --> 00:19:23,449
[SPEAKER_04]: Just because I could just pew-pew stuff, and as long as I didn't fuck up, which I never fucked up, I'd get pissed off at other people fucking up, but then it gave me an excuse to be mad at somebody else.

309
00:19:24,642 --> 00:19:25,743
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

310
00:19:42,683 --> 00:20:01,347
[SPEAKER_10]: that you have to like and like only the ones you send into the fight actually get XP and it's like oh my gosh I gotta grind this and grind this and it's like the OCD gamer in me and like Shane has tried to tell me this like why are you leveling up all your Pokemon you only need like three of them to be really good to go somewhere and I'm like you don't understand how I play RPGs

311
00:20:02,293 --> 00:20:03,834
[SPEAKER_11]: No, yeah, I totally get that.

312
00:20:03,894 --> 00:20:07,316
[SPEAKER_11]: It sets off my OCD like, whoa, it's like 100% completion, bitches.

313
00:20:07,496 --> 00:20:08,517
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's in the lyrics.

314
00:20:08,757 --> 00:20:10,938
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to be the very best.

315
00:20:11,778 --> 00:20:12,559
[SPEAKER_11]: First sentence.

316
00:20:13,139 --> 00:20:18,802
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that re-release of the first three games when you've got all the new areas and you've got the three new islands.

317
00:20:18,882 --> 00:20:21,184
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought it was never going to crawl out of my room.

318
00:20:21,664 --> 00:20:24,966
[SPEAKER_11]: I was going to crawl out of it to die, basically, and not for water or food or anything.

319
00:20:25,845 --> 00:20:34,028
[SPEAKER_10]: So here's why I'm really excited about X and Y is that apparently they're going to have this experience sharing so that now you can actually level everything that's in your party at once.

320
00:20:34,148 --> 00:20:37,048
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, based Pokemon.

321
00:20:37,409 --> 00:20:38,349
[SPEAKER_10]: I am so excited.

322
00:20:39,009 --> 00:20:41,010
[SPEAKER_10]: So we'll see.

323
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:43,870
[SPEAKER_11]: No putting Magikarp into battle first and hoping like hell.

324
00:20:46,351 --> 00:20:50,452
[SPEAKER_03]: But you got to admit, once you got Gyarados, everyone was fucked.

325
00:20:52,614 --> 00:20:53,175
[SPEAKER_03]: It was worth it.

326
00:20:53,775 --> 00:20:54,456
[SPEAKER_10]: So worth it.

327
00:20:54,796 --> 00:20:59,400
[SPEAKER_04]: And I have to say that Pokemon has offered me comfort over the years.

328
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:02,182
[SPEAKER_04]: My Charmander pillow was my AX pillow.

329
00:21:02,962 --> 00:21:06,205
[SPEAKER_04]: And my Togepi was my present after I got held up at gunpoint.

330
00:21:06,545 --> 00:21:07,106
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my gosh.

331
00:21:08,359 --> 00:21:08,819
[SPEAKER_08]: That's scary.

332
00:21:08,839 --> 00:21:09,579
[SPEAKER_04]: You know that happened.

333
00:21:09,639 --> 00:21:10,119
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, no, I know.

334
00:21:10,139 --> 00:21:15,580
[SPEAKER_04]: When you were working at the... I found $10 in the parking lot and Dan gave me another $10 and I bought a Togepi.

335
00:21:16,281 --> 00:21:17,861
[SPEAKER_04]: And I still have my Togepi.

336
00:21:18,981 --> 00:21:19,661
[SPEAKER_04]: I love Togepi.

337
00:21:19,701 --> 00:21:20,301
[SPEAKER_04]: So cute.

338
00:21:20,942 --> 00:21:21,262
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

339
00:21:21,322 --> 00:21:22,302
[SPEAKER_10]: So, yeah.

340
00:21:22,882 --> 00:21:23,382
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

341
00:21:23,502 --> 00:21:28,063
[SPEAKER_10]: So it sounds to me like there's half going to get it and half not going to get Pokemon.

342
00:21:28,743 --> 00:21:29,223
[SPEAKER_10]: So we'll see.

343
00:21:29,263 --> 00:21:29,563
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

344
00:21:30,143 --> 00:21:31,624
[SPEAKER_10]: We will be checking with listeners later.

345
00:21:32,024 --> 00:21:33,924
[SPEAKER_04]: Pokemon is like STDs.

346
00:21:33,964 --> 00:21:35,084
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't got to catch them all.

347
00:21:36,485 --> 00:21:37,005
[SPEAKER_10]: Stop.

348
00:21:37,645 --> 00:21:38,005
[SPEAKER_10]: Stop.

349
00:21:38,565 --> 00:21:38,865
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

350
00:21:39,606 --> 00:21:44,568
[SPEAKER_10]: And of course, there's the mandatory Actdeft in chat says, how about them mudkips?

351
00:21:45,268 --> 00:21:45,608
[SPEAKER_10]: Shut up.

352
00:21:46,089 --> 00:21:46,629
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

353
00:21:47,049 --> 00:21:50,171
[SPEAKER_10]: Matt Cube says, it is popular because it is a simple RPG.

354
00:21:50,531 --> 00:21:54,673
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you know, I don't want to spoil the Fugle question of the week because we're going to get into it a little later.

355
00:21:54,753 --> 00:21:59,595
[SPEAKER_10]: But I just will say in general, I'm hearing a lot of people that are really attached to Pokemon.

356
00:21:59,895 --> 00:22:05,318
[SPEAKER_10]: The reason behind it a lot of times is that we're from that certain generation where like we were like,

357
00:22:05,578 --> 00:22:05,999
[SPEAKER_10]: and DarkSakura.

358
00:22:22,779 --> 00:22:23,639
[SPEAKER_07]: They do catch diseases.

359
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:24,900
[SPEAKER_03]: Pikachu has rabies.

360
00:22:25,721 --> 00:22:27,822
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to decapitate him to figure it out.

361
00:22:28,002 --> 00:22:31,544
[SPEAKER_10]: They get like burn and paralyze and all that.

362
00:22:31,944 --> 00:22:34,786
[SPEAKER_10]: Is it a sick burn?

363
00:22:34,866 --> 00:22:36,306
[SPEAKER_07]: Pikachu, you're lame.

364
00:22:36,426 --> 00:22:37,087
[SPEAKER_06]: Burn.

365
00:22:37,487 --> 00:22:38,007
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh no.

366
00:22:38,948 --> 00:22:39,948
[SPEAKER_07]: It was very effective.

367
00:22:40,809 --> 00:22:47,913
[SPEAKER_11]: Little minigame where they have burn outside of battle and you've got to swath them in gauze and take them to the hospital and they've got like five weeks of recovery.

368
00:22:48,633 --> 00:22:54,235
[SPEAKER_04]: And then like Nurse Joy won't let you have them because you have to be evaluated for Pokemon crudely.

369
00:22:54,535 --> 00:22:56,136
[SPEAKER_10]: Nurse Joy is my favorite.

370
00:22:56,776 --> 00:23:01,538
[SPEAKER_10]: She's my absolute favorite character next to Jigglypuff in the whole thing is Nurse Joy.

371
00:23:01,558 --> 00:23:01,598
[SPEAKER_07]: Ew.

372
00:23:01,618 --> 00:23:06,500
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, they had like I think a new mini series of Pokemon that they're putting out.

373
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:07,220
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, they are.

374
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,661
[SPEAKER_07]: Somebody was just asking me in chat about it too.

375
00:23:08,681 --> 00:23:08,981
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my God.

376
00:23:10,069 --> 00:23:10,770
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to talk about this.

377
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:20,076
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you see that gif that's going around on Tumblr of like a squirtle beating the shit out of a Charmander and Red's like there with his mouth open like, holy shit!

378
00:23:20,476 --> 00:23:22,517
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean beating the shit out of him.

379
00:23:22,858 --> 00:23:24,118
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, no, come back.

380
00:23:24,639 --> 00:23:28,461
[SPEAKER_07]: Literally forcing his fist into his ass and shit is popping out.

381
00:23:28,481 --> 00:23:29,742
[SPEAKER_07]: God, why are you being nasty?

382
00:23:29,822 --> 00:23:30,883
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's a gif.

383
00:23:31,183 --> 00:23:36,206
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll have to find it on Tumblr but it's like seriously just like going full on ballistic.

384
00:23:36,287 --> 00:23:36,867
[SPEAKER_04]: It's hilarious.

385
00:23:36,887 --> 00:23:39,969
[SPEAKER_07]: Finding a gif on Tumblr, man, that's like a needle in a haystack right there.

386
00:23:40,137 --> 00:23:40,265
HAHA

387
00:23:42,265 --> 00:23:45,006
[SPEAKER_10]: Alpha Cananogram says, are you going to watch Pokemon Origins?

388
00:23:45,106 --> 00:23:45,646
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to.

389
00:23:45,746 --> 00:23:47,307
[SPEAKER_10]: It's supposedly really short.

390
00:23:47,347 --> 00:23:49,088
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that gif is from Pokemon Origins.

391
00:23:49,888 --> 00:23:50,148
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

392
00:23:50,908 --> 00:23:52,169
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, we've got to move on with the show.

393
00:23:52,789 --> 00:23:54,210
[SPEAKER_10]: We've got to get into gaming week still.

394
00:23:54,670 --> 00:23:56,290
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll talk more Pokemons later.

395
00:23:57,011 --> 00:24:01,192
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think I made my decision, I will say, as far as Pokemon goes.

396
00:24:01,292 --> 00:24:03,773
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to get... Hold on.

397
00:24:04,013 --> 00:24:04,313
[SPEAKER_10]: Shut up.

398
00:24:04,714 --> 00:24:09,896
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to get Pokemon Y. I've decided I'm going to get Pokemon Y. And...

399
00:24:10,996 --> 00:24:12,697
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

400
00:24:41,094 --> 00:24:55,688
[SPEAKER_04]: um Fractal is pretty much video gaming crack I've and thank you Rob for uh giving uh for gifting Bejeweled 2 to me because um you're welcome because I played the crap load of that but it's still more fun on my phone

401
00:24:56,384 --> 00:24:58,627
[SPEAKER_10]: Actdeft, I cannot look at videos on my iPad while I'm doing the show.

402
00:24:58,647 --> 00:24:58,867
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry.

403
00:25:17,148 --> 00:25:18,709
[SPEAKER_04]: Take a picture of the sun, Steven.

404
00:25:45,825 --> 00:25:46,566
[SPEAKER_10]: All my heavens.

405
00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:51,073
[SPEAKER_11]: That is the most gruesome thing I've ever seen.

406
00:25:54,078 --> 00:25:55,580
[SPEAKER_10]: Those are... That was...

407
00:25:56,827 --> 00:25:59,568
[SPEAKER_10]: That scream was not okay.

408
00:25:59,788 --> 00:26:02,108
[SPEAKER_10]: A bite out of Charmander's neck.

409
00:26:02,788 --> 00:26:12,370
[SPEAKER_10]: The audio had to be even worse because that sounded like, I don't know, that was not okay, that high-pitched screaming.

410
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:15,951
[SPEAKER_11]: That was a little too visually vague for me.

411
00:26:17,911 --> 00:26:20,592
[SPEAKER_10]: Actdeft, I want you to apologize to the listeners right now.

412
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,041
[SPEAKER_04]: Poor Charmander.

413
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:24,401
[SPEAKER_04]: That is a rabid Squirtle.

414
00:26:25,521 --> 00:26:26,742
[SPEAKER_04]: That Squirtle needs to be put down.

415
00:26:26,762 --> 00:26:29,503
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh my god, that sound was horrible.

416
00:26:29,723 --> 00:26:34,344
[SPEAKER_11]: Although it has settled the age-old debate of reptiles versus amphibians.

417
00:26:34,604 --> 00:26:37,785
[SPEAKER_11]: Because, you know, turtles and salamanders, natural enemies.

418
00:26:40,346 --> 00:26:45,828
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I played other games that didn't involve Squirtles biting the crap out of Charmanders.

419
00:26:45,868 --> 00:26:46,208
[SPEAKER_04]: And the, ah!

420
00:26:51,437 --> 00:26:53,257
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft says, sorry, I'm so sorry.

421
00:26:54,718 --> 00:26:55,498
[SPEAKER_04]: Good, good.

422
00:26:55,718 --> 00:26:56,118
[SPEAKER_04]: Mean it.

423
00:26:58,599 --> 00:27:01,640
[SPEAKER_10]: Next time Loki goes on to one of his rants, I'm just going to have that queued up.

424
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:04,600
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I did buy something on sale on Steam.

425
00:27:05,301 --> 00:27:05,721
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, what?

426
00:27:06,061 --> 00:27:07,961
[SPEAKER_04]: I bought Bioshock Infinite last night.

427
00:27:08,181 --> 00:27:11,802
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah, they've been having Uber sales this weekend.

428
00:27:12,222 --> 00:27:16,083
[SPEAKER_04]: And also, Half-Life 2 is like $3.

429
00:27:16,763 --> 00:27:18,504
[SPEAKER_04]: So I picked that up for PC.

430
00:27:19,404 --> 00:27:24,868
[SPEAKER_04]: so that, you know, I don't have to hurt my hand playing it on Xbox.

431
00:27:26,049 --> 00:27:33,635
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, I've, I just, it's pretty much, oh, yeah, and of course, my crack, my animal crack, Animal Crossing.

432
00:27:33,675 --> 00:27:34,236
[SPEAKER_10]: Animal cracking.

433
00:27:34,816 --> 00:27:42,262
[SPEAKER_04]: Which, just to say, I'm actually considering busting out the GameCube again and playing my Dobutunomori.

434
00:27:42,982 --> 00:27:43,342
[SPEAKER_10]: Why not?

435
00:27:43,362 --> 00:27:45,064
[SPEAKER_10]: Because you can unlock the NES cartridges.

436
00:27:45,084 --> 00:27:45,344
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

437
00:27:45,748 --> 00:27:46,469
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yeah.

438
00:27:46,849 --> 00:27:50,512
[SPEAKER_04]: The one that I have, there were two versions that came out on GameCube.

439
00:27:50,992 --> 00:27:54,174
[SPEAKER_04]: There was Doubutsu no Mori Plus, which is the one I have.

440
00:27:54,334 --> 00:27:58,077
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we got a better one in America after that.

441
00:27:58,337 --> 00:28:00,079
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that one was re-released in Japan as E+.

442
00:28:00,839 --> 00:28:01,800
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

443
00:28:18,962 --> 00:28:19,963
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

444
00:28:40,177 --> 00:28:49,681
[SPEAKER_04]: and then Dan is all like starting to get on Fire Emblem but then he was back on GTA 5 so I'm like, are you gonna be done?

445
00:28:50,001 --> 00:28:54,463
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, well wait until Blah Blah comes out and you're never gonna see the DS again.

446
00:28:54,503 --> 00:28:58,084
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, you watch and you're not touching the game because I'm playing Animal Crossing.

447
00:28:59,345 --> 00:29:06,588
[SPEAKER_04]: And I am still trying to get the stupid kitchen island but none of the islands ever have it so fuck the fucking fuckers.

448
00:29:06,628 --> 00:29:07,388
[SPEAKER_04]: But I have a tan now.

449
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:11,253
[SPEAKER_10]: So, you have to go to the island to get your island.

450
00:29:12,634 --> 00:29:13,334
[SPEAKER_04]: To get a tan?

451
00:29:13,374 --> 00:29:15,696
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, to get my island.

452
00:29:16,137 --> 00:29:18,639
[SPEAKER_10]: There's too much this and a that in tonight's show.

453
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:26,085
[SPEAKER_04]: But for anyone who wants to know how to keep your tan in the winter months, go visit the island in the morning.

454
00:29:27,266 --> 00:29:28,286
[SPEAKER_04]: And don't wear a hat.

455
00:29:29,988 --> 00:29:31,569
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of the hats actually block you from getting tans.

456
00:29:31,669 --> 00:29:32,550
[SPEAKER_10]: Is it real life?

457
00:29:32,650 --> 00:29:33,711
[SPEAKER_10]: Is it Animal Crossing?

458
00:29:33,931 --> 00:29:35,372
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know anymore, people.

459
00:29:35,893 --> 00:29:37,574
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, my character's cute.

460
00:29:38,024 --> 00:29:40,405
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft, you need to give me that.

461
00:29:41,425 --> 00:29:42,586
[SPEAKER_04]: You can get another one now.

462
00:29:42,646 --> 00:29:43,526
[SPEAKER_04]: Just give it to me.

463
00:29:45,107 --> 00:29:47,048
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft has a kitchen island and needs to give it to me.

464
00:29:47,068 --> 00:29:49,669
[SPEAKER_10]: Can't you visit his town and order it?

465
00:29:49,709 --> 00:29:50,609
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm plugging in right now.

466
00:29:52,410 --> 00:29:54,571
[SPEAKER_10]: Nice.

467
00:29:54,931 --> 00:29:57,692
[SPEAKER_10]: She took my DS charger off the table.

468
00:30:00,214 --> 00:30:01,616
[SPEAKER_10]: and going, I'm taking this.

469
00:30:01,836 --> 00:30:05,640
[SPEAKER_10]: This is mine now because there's an island for me to go steal from somebody else.

470
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:07,282
[SPEAKER_10]: She's stealing from two people.

471
00:30:07,822 --> 00:30:08,623
[SPEAKER_11]: Nine tenths of the law.

472
00:30:10,025 --> 00:30:10,726
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't encourage her.

473
00:30:11,206 --> 00:30:11,567
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

474
00:30:12,708 --> 00:30:15,491
[SPEAKER_10]: Chell, while you're still on my good side, how was your gaming week?

475
00:30:16,152 --> 00:30:19,133
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, you know, pretty chill, you know, when I get a free minute.

476
00:30:19,773 --> 00:30:23,114
[SPEAKER_11]: Usually, you know, during school months, I'm kind of a casual gamer.

477
00:30:23,755 --> 00:30:25,815
[SPEAKER_11]: I've mostly been getting my PC game on.

478
00:30:26,376 --> 00:30:27,316
[SPEAKER_11]: Can I plug something?

479
00:30:28,716 --> 00:30:29,077
[SPEAKER_12]: Absolutely.

480
00:30:29,417 --> 00:30:31,758
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, so there's this one indie game coming out.

481
00:30:31,798 --> 00:30:39,900
[SPEAKER_11]: I've only played the demo so far, but oh man, you know, I think it's made in RPG Maker or something very similar.

482
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,021
[SPEAKER_11]: It's called Undertale.

483
00:30:41,681 --> 00:30:43,702
[SPEAKER_11]: And the lead creator is Toby Foxx.

484
00:30:44,602 --> 00:30:48,344
[SPEAKER_11]: Man, you know, give money to this developer any way you can.

485
00:30:48,384 --> 00:30:50,044
[SPEAKER_11]: If he's walking by, throw money at his head.

486
00:30:50,065 --> 00:30:52,766
[SPEAKER_11]: Because this was like, just the demo just blew me away.

487
00:30:52,846 --> 00:30:56,347
[SPEAKER_11]: It has all the emotional punches of, you know, Earthbound, which I'm pretty partial to.

488
00:30:57,008 --> 00:30:58,048
[SPEAKER_10]: What'd you say this guy's name was?

489
00:30:58,348 --> 00:30:58,948
[SPEAKER_11]: Toby Fox.

490
00:30:59,169 --> 00:31:02,330
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, that poor guy you know has got to be getting asked, what does the fox say?

491
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:05,431
[SPEAKER_10]: She is encouraging bags of pennies to be flung at his head.

492
00:31:05,772 --> 00:31:06,052
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

493
00:31:06,192 --> 00:31:06,632
[SPEAKER_07]: Just saying.

494
00:31:06,772 --> 00:31:08,233
[SPEAKER_11]: He will thank you through the tears.

495
00:31:09,133 --> 00:31:12,496
[SPEAKER_11]: Because, you know, he had a Kickstarter and, you know, that closed.

496
00:31:12,536 --> 00:31:14,277
[SPEAKER_11]: But, you know, this comes out, buy it.

497
00:31:14,337 --> 00:31:17,359
[SPEAKER_11]: You will thank yourself after you stop crying, which maybe never.

498
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:21,662
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait, so is that like crying laughter or crying like this game is really sad?

499
00:31:21,762 --> 00:31:23,904
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, crying, like they punch you in the emotions.

500
00:31:23,944 --> 00:31:28,147
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not even necessarily sad, but it's a really beautiful, unique game experience.

501
00:31:28,167 --> 00:31:31,510
[SPEAKER_11]: The whole thing is you're this kid lost in this kind of underground place.

502
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:33,011
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, Earthbound.

503
00:31:33,031 --> 00:31:33,251
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, my God.

504
00:31:34,031 --> 00:31:57,824
[SPEAKER_11]: and so the the combat is kind of unique the combat system is you can choose to spare a monster or fight them and the whole you know this has been kind of done before but it affects how people interact with you and yeah no it's saying what I love about it we'll spoil it that's how much you need to go out and like play the demo and yeah throw money at him hopefully paper

505
00:31:58,699 --> 00:32:09,510
[SPEAKER_10]: That's fair, because in the beginning when I first played Journey, and since the game's been out for over a year now, it's fair for me to spoil it, especially because I think everybody knows this twist.

506
00:32:09,991 --> 00:32:13,975
[SPEAKER_10]: I said it was best to go into Journey to not know that it's secretly a multiplayer game.

507
00:32:14,295 --> 00:32:14,775
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

508
00:32:33,487 --> 00:32:38,508
[SPEAKER_10]: that you know is a real person, but it's so hard to explain.

509
00:32:38,888 --> 00:32:43,989
[SPEAKER_10]: But it was one of those things because I didn't know when I played it for the first time that that was the twist in the game.

510
00:32:44,049 --> 00:32:52,111
[SPEAKER_10]: I was like, I want everybody to play Journey like that where they find out that twist on their own, and I think that kind of keeps it all the more shocking.

511
00:32:53,311 --> 00:32:55,352
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, the chat room made me think of another game.

512
00:32:55,772 --> 00:32:56,732
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm playing Mass Effect 3 again.

513
00:32:57,723 --> 00:32:58,783
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course, of course.

514
00:32:59,003 --> 00:33:01,224
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, emotional manipulation, I'm all for that.

515
00:33:02,204 --> 00:33:08,666
[SPEAKER_11]: I've also, you know, I really need to pick up the first Darkness, but I've also been playing Darkness 2 because I'm so topical.

516
00:33:09,106 --> 00:33:14,568
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, I really am enjoying the gameplay, but mostly I'm playing it for Mike Patton's juicy, juicy voice.

517
00:33:17,749 --> 00:33:18,249
[SPEAKER_08]: Fair enough.

518
00:33:18,369 --> 00:33:21,090
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, you know, I know it's been set up and down, but no post-production.

519
00:33:21,370 --> 00:33:23,631
[SPEAKER_11]: The man is demonically good.

520
00:33:24,691 --> 00:33:25,111
[SPEAKER_10]: Awesome.

521
00:33:25,952 --> 00:33:26,352
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

522
00:33:26,692 --> 00:33:32,475
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I'm sure the indie scene loves the fact that you're plugging that stuff.

523
00:33:32,535 --> 00:33:33,956
[SPEAKER_10]: So, yeah, by all means.

524
00:33:34,296 --> 00:33:35,697
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there a website that you know off the top of your head?

525
00:33:36,137 --> 00:33:39,939
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, they've got a Tumblr, and it's just search Undertale.

526
00:33:40,059 --> 00:33:40,799
[SPEAKER_11]: They should pop up.

527
00:33:40,859 --> 00:33:44,421
[SPEAKER_11]: I think they've got an official site, but so far it's just got the demo on it.

528
00:33:44,441 --> 00:33:48,243
[SPEAKER_11]: The Tumblr is mostly posting fan art right now and updates, which are kind of sparse.

529
00:33:48,463 --> 00:33:48,623
[SPEAKER_12]: Mm-hmm.

530
00:33:49,003 --> 00:33:55,306
[SPEAKER_11]: and, you know, I'm doing this completely unprompted, which, you know, I might appreciate a game kicked my way someday.

531
00:33:56,987 --> 00:33:58,067
[SPEAKER_10]: Fair enough, fair enough.

532
00:33:58,548 --> 00:34:00,008
[SPEAKER_11]: Not naming any names, Toby Fox.

533
00:34:01,329 --> 00:34:01,629
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

534
00:34:02,530 --> 00:34:05,471
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, well, let's move on then, if that's everything Chell has for now.

535
00:34:05,651 --> 00:34:06,852
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll go over to Loki.

536
00:34:07,052 --> 00:34:07,952
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

537
00:34:08,292 --> 00:34:09,413
[SPEAKER_07]: I just played Grand Theft Auto.

538
00:34:10,971 --> 00:34:12,072
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Mass Effect.

539
00:34:12,312 --> 00:34:13,212
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a shock.

540
00:34:14,213 --> 00:34:19,075
[SPEAKER_10]: To be fair, I see Tim Tripp in the chat room says, oh man, I missed the Mass Effect tears.

541
00:34:19,335 --> 00:34:21,336
[SPEAKER_10]: That's kind of what prompted Jamie to go down that path.

542
00:34:21,416 --> 00:34:23,437
[SPEAKER_10]: She was provoked by chat.

543
00:34:25,081 --> 00:34:26,863
[SPEAKER_10]: Grand Theft Auto Online What's the game?

544
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:45,601
[SPEAKER_07]: There's an actual storyline that goes along with it.

545
00:34:45,721 --> 00:34:51,704
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically, your character comes to Los Santos after Lamar, which is Franklin's friend in the single-player game.

546
00:34:52,104 --> 00:34:55,446
[SPEAKER_07]: He follows you on Life Invader, which is their version of Facebook.

547
00:34:56,926 --> 00:34:59,367
[SPEAKER_07]: You come into town and you're doing jobs for different people.

548
00:34:59,447 --> 00:35:03,109
[SPEAKER_07]: They have a guy, Simeon, that you're doing repos for.

549
00:35:03,229 --> 00:35:11,233
[SPEAKER_07]: There's some other guys that you're doing drug stuff for, stealing meth from people and

550
00:35:11,893 --> 00:35:39,297
[SPEAKER_07]: and that's just like the missions and then on top of all that you can do the free roaming stuff where you can rob liquor stores you can steal cars you can just shoot people you know one on one do that stuff or there's races death matches you can do skydiving stuff a whole bunch of different activities in the game and it's up to 16 players and you get randomly thrown in with some people usually and

551
00:35:39,837 --> 00:35:43,520
[SPEAKER_07]: and then on top of that you can do these death matches and stuff with other people.

552
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:51,607
[SPEAKER_07]: So a lot of times what I've found is I'm getting dumped in a game, I'll go do a mission or something, I'll come back and it's not the same people in the same world anymore.

553
00:35:51,687 --> 00:35:53,308
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like a whole different set of people.

554
00:35:54,109 --> 00:35:56,211
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you have something to add to that, Chell?

555
00:35:56,531 --> 00:35:59,754
[SPEAKER_11]: I was just going to say kids, don't take drugs.

556
00:36:00,154 --> 00:36:00,755
[SPEAKER_11]: Buy your own.

557
00:36:03,757 --> 00:36:04,578
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't say that!

558
00:36:06,212 --> 00:36:07,374
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been enjoying it so far.

559
00:36:07,394 --> 00:36:11,919
[SPEAKER_07]: You get to create how your character looks based off of your ancestry and stuff.

560
00:36:11,939 --> 00:36:17,325
[SPEAKER_07]: They have different people that you pick as your grandparents and your parents.

561
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:21,189
[SPEAKER_07]: Or you pick the grandparents and that alters what the parents look like and then

562
00:36:21,850 --> 00:36:23,050
[SPEAKER_07]: that alters what you look like.

563
00:36:23,671 --> 00:36:33,094
[SPEAKER_10]: And I heard, and I was reading an email a little bit ahead of the game, so I apologize for the email, or I'm going to spoil a little bit of their email, but I heard you can be a woman in Grand Theft Auto Online.

564
00:36:33,354 --> 00:36:38,716
[SPEAKER_10]: So that kind of helps the whole, like, you can never be one, but you can in Grand Theft Auto Online.

565
00:36:39,016 --> 00:36:39,776
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

566
00:36:59,562 --> 00:37:00,003
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

567
00:37:18,021 --> 00:37:19,742
[SPEAKER_07]: So they have to wait outside the store.

568
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:21,343
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I know they're doing that.

569
00:37:21,403 --> 00:37:24,446
[SPEAKER_07]: So immediately when I go out there, I switch my gun and I shoot them.

570
00:37:24,746 --> 00:37:28,568
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I'm like... So you shoot kids is what you're saying here on the show.

571
00:37:28,648 --> 00:37:29,989
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm shooting kids playing the game.

572
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:34,793
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki is the enforcement to keep kids out of Grand Theft Auto.

573
00:37:35,533 --> 00:37:37,915
[SPEAKER_10]: If he sees a child playing Grand Theft Auto, he will shoot them.

574
00:37:38,195 --> 00:37:41,057
[SPEAKER_07]: But you can do all sorts of things.

575
00:37:41,157 --> 00:37:43,799
[SPEAKER_07]: You can buy property in the game and garages.

576
00:37:43,979 --> 00:37:46,681
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can customize your cars and the way you look and everything.

577
00:37:47,481 --> 00:37:48,381
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just, it's kind of fun.

578
00:37:48,561 --> 00:37:53,723
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just this whole leveling up system and stuff and you level up your stats based on what you're doing in the game.

579
00:37:53,743 --> 00:37:57,163
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I don't know, I'm enjoying it.

580
00:37:57,183 --> 00:37:58,384
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been playing both on PS3 and 360.

581
00:37:58,844 --> 00:38:07,425
[SPEAKER_07]: The PS3, I'm on level 12 because I've been playing that mostly because my coworkers say, oh yeah, get the PS3 version, we're going to be totally on there playing PS3.

582
00:38:07,606 --> 00:38:09,486
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, not a single one of them on PS3.

583
00:38:10,146 --> 00:38:13,329
[SPEAKER_07]: So I may go back to 360 again and level up my character there.

584
00:38:13,389 --> 00:38:16,231
[SPEAKER_07]: But we have the crew.

585
00:38:17,031 --> 00:38:17,632
[SPEAKER_07]: It's open.

586
00:38:17,652 --> 00:38:19,493
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got our fun little logo there and stuff.

587
00:38:19,533 --> 00:38:26,278
[SPEAKER_07]: So Rockstar Social Club, look for crews, look for VOG Network, and you can sign up and come play with us, I guess.

588
00:38:26,478 --> 00:38:26,918
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

589
00:38:27,679 --> 00:38:30,542
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

590
00:38:49,181 --> 00:39:02,300
[SPEAKER_10]: and all that to get my seal or my I keep saying seals but there are tomes actually and that's really mostly what I've been doing I gotta say though I was really impressed with the ending I'm using my quotey fingers because you know it's an MMO it doesn't really end

591
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:30,259
[SPEAKER_10]: but Final Fantasy XIV has a pretty definitive story from start to finish and when you finish the actual story you get like this 25 minute ending and I gotta say I was happy with it and it's simple but it's effective like for somebody that's really invested a lot of time in the game I was like I really get the sense that I accomplished something and now I see what's next for my character and that's such a great feeling playing an MMO which usually doesn't

592
00:39:30,999 --> 00:39:31,619
[SPEAKER_10]: Ever End.

593
00:39:32,039 --> 00:39:34,080
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah, that's really all I can say.

594
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,440
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't really talk about a lot of other games.

595
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:39,581
[SPEAKER_10]: I will say I did pick up a new toy the other day.

596
00:39:39,801 --> 00:39:44,962
[SPEAKER_10]: I did pick up a new HD game capture card or I should say more like a box.

597
00:39:45,002 --> 00:39:45,622
[SPEAKER_10]: It's more a box.

598
00:39:45,722 --> 00:39:46,962
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like a USB connected thing.

599
00:39:47,242 --> 00:39:58,344
[SPEAKER_10]: And I am really excited because I purposely wanted to get something that would do the new consoles through HDMI and this does the old consoles because the component doubles as a composite plug-in.

600
00:39:58,664 --> 00:40:24,826
[SPEAKER_10]: So I am really excited to stream a variety of stuff as soon as I can get it working with my laptop and all that So that's something in the future, in the coming weeks So I will be able to diversify things a little more than just playing the same MMO all week long I'm going to force myself to do that I've been very busy with personal life stuff Rocky Horror, which I'm directing, is this coming Saturday So as you can imagine, I'm super busy with that

601
00:40:25,037 --> 00:40:28,842
[SPEAKER_04]: I wouldn't know anything about playing all games to the exception of all else.

602
00:40:30,084 --> 00:40:31,626
[SPEAKER_10]: And how many hours have you spent on Mass Effect?

603
00:40:32,066 --> 00:40:32,387
[SPEAKER_10]: Shut up.

604
00:40:32,867 --> 00:40:34,089
[SPEAKER_10]: Three digits or four now?

605
00:40:34,770 --> 00:40:35,411
[SPEAKER_10]: Shut up!

606
00:40:36,632 --> 00:40:36,973
[SPEAKER_10]: Alrighty.

607
00:40:37,774 --> 00:40:39,015
[SPEAKER_10]: That's enough for our gaming weeks.

608
00:40:39,536 --> 00:40:40,657
[SPEAKER_10]: Quickly, some housekeeping.

609
00:40:41,781 --> 00:40:43,723
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, I actually have things for housekeeping tonight.

610
00:40:44,023 --> 00:40:47,265
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to plug another podcast I was on today and thank them for having me.

611
00:40:47,566 --> 00:40:50,027
[SPEAKER_10]: Check out the Let's Wow podcast.

612
00:40:50,348 --> 00:40:51,629
[SPEAKER_10]: That is World of Warcraft.

613
00:40:52,029 --> 00:40:57,853
[SPEAKER_10]: So yes, I still dabble in World of Warcraft even though I've talked about a lot of Final Fantasy XIV lately, but I did guest on their show tonight.

614
00:40:58,114 --> 00:41:00,816
[SPEAKER_10]: That's episode number 31 and you can check that out.

615
00:41:00,876 --> 00:41:04,338
[SPEAKER_10]: That'll be in their archive soon, available on iTunes and Stitcher and all that.

616
00:41:04,599 --> 00:41:06,180
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, that's the Let's Wow podcast.

617
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,601
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you kids for having me on.

618
00:41:07,621 --> 00:41:10,163
[SPEAKER_10]: And we talked about World of Warcraft and other MMOs.

619
00:41:10,884 --> 00:41:15,348
[SPEAKER_10]: And I razzed my good buddy Gemet for a good 500 minutes.

620
00:41:16,949 --> 00:41:17,329
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see.

621
00:41:17,489 --> 00:41:18,330
[SPEAKER_10]: Other things I want to plug.

622
00:41:18,870 --> 00:41:25,496
[SPEAKER_10]: It is that time of year again where a lot of podcasts are going to be asking you to vote for them in the Podcast Awards.

623
00:41:26,056 --> 00:41:32,662
[SPEAKER_10]: Which is right now kind of what we have in the little podcast industry to recognize the podcast media world.

624
00:41:33,663 --> 00:41:39,286
[SPEAKER_10]: Sometimes I'm a little iffy on how I feel with it all being kind of a popularity contest at the end of the day.

625
00:41:39,807 --> 00:41:47,912
[SPEAKER_10]: But I will say being able to be nominated for it and collect the votes and stuff is really good promotion for us.

626
00:41:48,352 --> 00:41:57,278
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's always really nice to be able to kind of share in that with other gaming podcasts that really work hard for what they do.

627
00:41:57,378 --> 00:42:01,701
[SPEAKER_10]: So I hope we will get that honor again this year to be in the podcast awards.

628
00:42:01,761 --> 00:42:02,382
[SPEAKER_10]: But if we aren't,

629
00:42:03,082 --> 00:42:32,406
[SPEAKER_10]: we're still going to do what we do here every Sunday night regardless but I would encourage you podcastawards.com if you like what you hear here at Orange Lounge Radio please consider nominating us for best gaming podcast and because you can actually do you can do the one of the top two categories and a subcategory gaming is a subcategory we're also going to urge you to vote for people's choice for Orange Lounge Radio which kind of makes sense because we're a show about people and community and you guys all having a voice so people's choice and gaming

630
00:42:32,586 --> 00:42:33,387
[SPEAKER_10]: and We're Choice.

631
00:42:34,888 --> 00:42:36,229
[SPEAKER_10]: So there you go.

632
00:42:36,269 --> 00:42:37,930
[SPEAKER_10]: Check that out, podcastawards.com.

633
00:42:38,191 --> 00:42:45,296
[SPEAKER_10]: We really appreciate your consideration and consider supporting other independent podcasts that you listen to throughout other categories as well.

634
00:42:45,477 --> 00:42:50,160
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you feel that some other podcast is more deserving of a nomination than us, then that's cool.

635
00:42:50,501 --> 00:42:50,901
[SPEAKER_10]: We're good.

636
00:42:51,902 --> 00:42:55,425
[SPEAKER_10]: Just support your favorite show no matter who it may be.

637
00:42:56,451 --> 00:42:59,714
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, I think that's it for housekeeping.

638
00:42:59,774 --> 00:43:04,197
[SPEAKER_10]: Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR, and Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

639
00:43:04,957 --> 00:43:07,900
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, now we can have ourselves some gaming news.

640
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:08,780
[SPEAKER_10]: So, Loki?

641
00:43:09,321 --> 00:43:11,182
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's get on to some gaming news.

642
00:43:12,303 --> 00:43:15,826
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, so let's talk a little bit about the Xbox One.

643
00:43:16,286 --> 00:43:21,270
[SPEAKER_07]: It was, I guess, put out there this last week that...

644
00:43:21,630 --> 00:43:25,451
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to take about 15 to 20 minutes to download the Xbox One Day One patch.

645
00:43:26,131 --> 00:43:30,092
[SPEAKER_07]: So expect a short delay before you get into your gaming.

646
00:43:31,192 --> 00:43:41,035
[SPEAKER_07]: Which, if I remember correctly, I believe that is a lot less of a wait than you had to for the Wii U. Wasn't that Wii U Day One patch like...

647
00:43:43,324 --> 00:43:46,746
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that's because Nintendo's download servers are slow as hell.

648
00:43:47,366 --> 00:43:48,126
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, I don't know.

649
00:43:48,367 --> 00:43:49,767
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I think they've gotten a lot better.

650
00:43:50,008 --> 00:43:54,250
[SPEAKER_10]: But remember, all the crazy Nintendo fanboys were all hammering that thing at the same time.

651
00:43:54,270 --> 00:43:58,233
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, not that it excuses it, but it's the reason why it was downloading slow.

652
00:43:59,053 --> 00:43:59,413
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

653
00:44:00,094 --> 00:44:06,377
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I was going to talk real quick because I actually had noticed this and I posted it on Twitter earlier this week about...

654
00:44:07,959 --> 00:44:10,661
[SPEAKER_07]: The next gen digital file sizes.

655
00:44:10,741 --> 00:44:11,602
[SPEAKER_07]: Holy shit.

656
00:44:13,163 --> 00:44:16,366
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's some new SKUs that are coming out for a bunch of different things.

657
00:44:16,667 --> 00:44:17,367
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't know why.

658
00:44:18,208 --> 00:44:21,011
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess they're just trying to get people to buy in on this stuff.

659
00:44:21,031 --> 00:44:24,654
[SPEAKER_07]: But like NBA 2K14, they have a super fan pack.

660
00:44:25,154 --> 00:44:30,299
[SPEAKER_07]: And also for Call of Duty Ghosts, they have an Xbox edition.

661
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:49,749
[SPEAKER_07]: and what these two things are is they're retail items that are digital that you go to the store and buy this packaging and it comes with codes for both the Xbox 360 version and the Xbox One version or in the case of NBA 2K, the Xbox 360, Xbox One version or PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4 version.

662
00:44:52,116 --> 00:44:57,338
[SPEAKER_07]: The fine print, though, tells you how big those files are, like how much hard drive space you need.

663
00:44:57,878 --> 00:45:01,700
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's not a big surprise that the current gen stuff is anywhere from 8 to 10 gigs.

664
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:10,223
[SPEAKER_07]: The next gen stuff, and this is kind of like, you know, imagine if they went that way where they were trying to really push digital, 60 gigabytes.

665
00:45:10,703 --> 00:45:11,403
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

666
00:45:11,744 --> 00:45:11,403
60.

667
00:45:12,184 --> 00:45:14,845
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a long fucking time to download that.

668
00:45:14,945 --> 00:45:19,708
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, that is a good, like even on my good internet connection, about 15 hours.

669
00:45:19,788 --> 00:45:21,709
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's a lot of HD stuff.

670
00:45:22,249 --> 00:45:27,932
[SPEAKER_10]: And I mean, isn't it still out there, these caps on bandwidth that people get in a month?

671
00:45:28,092 --> 00:45:29,313
[SPEAKER_10]: I think there might be some.

672
00:45:29,333 --> 00:45:33,235
[SPEAKER_10]: I think Comcast suspended theirs for a little while and they were going to up it to 300 gigs.

673
00:45:33,295 --> 00:45:36,156
[SPEAKER_10]: But still, imagine Comcast up their thing to 300 gigs.

674
00:45:36,196 --> 00:45:39,018
[SPEAKER_10]: That's like six games in a month, which I guess that is a lot.

675
00:45:39,458 --> 00:45:42,319
[SPEAKER_10]: But, I mean, and then nothing else on your internet.

676
00:45:42,459 --> 00:45:43,439
[SPEAKER_10]: So, let's be real.

677
00:45:43,459 --> 00:45:46,339
[SPEAKER_07]: It's still, I mean, that's a long time to wait for something digitally.

678
00:45:46,419 --> 00:45:53,301
[SPEAKER_07]: And, yeah, I understand that they do have the technology where they can start streaming the game after a certain amount of it's downloaded.

679
00:45:53,341 --> 00:45:58,342
[SPEAKER_07]: But, shit, even if it's half of it, that's still eight hours that you have to wait before you can start playing that game.

680
00:45:59,502 --> 00:46:04,863
[SPEAKER_07]: And if that's something that you're planning on buying at launch, you know, you might as well just...

681
00:46:05,743 --> 00:46:07,085
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

682
00:46:21,107 --> 00:46:21,307
[SPEAKER_07]: and so on.

683
00:46:49,804 --> 00:46:57,889
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the reasons why their big ideas of making this all digital world is just not feasible right now with our internet infrastructure.

684
00:46:57,910 --> 00:46:58,730
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just not going to work.

685
00:47:00,051 --> 00:47:00,591
[SPEAKER_06]: So, that's it.

686
00:47:01,712 --> 00:47:02,592
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, what do you think though?

687
00:47:02,633 --> 00:47:08,816
[SPEAKER_10]: If the console life cycle is like 10 years or whatever, do you think that maybe in that amount of time we will be at that point?

688
00:47:09,477 --> 00:47:10,077
[SPEAKER_07]: Possibly.

689
00:47:10,377 --> 00:47:17,342
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's going to take some sort of, I think, government funding to kind of put, you know,

690
00:47:19,215 --> 00:47:30,922
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess get these companies to want to improve their infrastructure because right now a lot of these companies have monopolies in the different areas and so there's really no need for them to try to get their internet speeds faster.

691
00:47:30,982 --> 00:47:39,266
[SPEAKER_07]: Just like with Comcast, I was trying to get this one plan that they had that was $70 because I pay about $60, $70 right now for just internet.

692
00:47:39,747 --> 00:47:44,910
[SPEAKER_07]: It's in a different area where it's double the internet speed that I have now plus cable for the same price.

693
00:47:45,950 --> 00:47:46,630
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course...

694
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:49,812
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I'm sorry, that plan's not in our area.

695
00:47:49,993 --> 00:47:52,234
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course.

696
00:47:53,095 --> 00:47:53,715
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the problem.

697
00:47:53,735 --> 00:48:09,645
[SPEAKER_07]: There's monopolies everywhere, so they're not going to be in a big hurry to offer faster internet without some sort of government funding, because why bother spending the money on the upgrade or service when we can just charge more and keep the same level of service or decline it?

698
00:48:10,826 --> 00:48:15,888
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, well, one thing people were using their bandwidth for this week was to watch the latest Nintendo Direct.

699
00:48:16,108 --> 00:48:23,731
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, Nintendo likes to do these where they just take the news, they take their case straight to their hardcore fanbase, and it's been working for better or worse for them.

700
00:48:24,632 --> 00:48:30,514
[SPEAKER_10]: They unveiled the latest Nintendo Direct on October 1st, which kind of ran down, here's where Nintendo's at for the end of the year.

701
00:48:31,475 --> 00:48:31,955
[SPEAKER_10]: One big...

702
00:48:32,495 --> 00:48:33,275
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm gonna go out on a limb.

703
00:48:54,585 --> 00:48:55,966
[SPEAKER_10]: and say that this is strategy.

704
00:48:56,847 --> 00:49:08,817
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if this was necessarily because the game's not done, but this was maybe to buff up 2014, this coming winter, where things didn't work out so well in 2013.

705
00:49:08,997 --> 00:49:11,499
[SPEAKER_07]: I think you're right because they had too much stuff coming out.

706
00:49:11,699 --> 00:49:14,161
[SPEAKER_07]: In the fourth quarter, there's too much stuff coming out.

707
00:49:14,181 --> 00:49:17,624
[SPEAKER_07]: Nintendo themselves, they have Wii Fit U in the beginning of November.

708
00:49:17,984 --> 00:49:18,645
[SPEAKER_07]: Super Mario 3D World

709
00:49:41,412 --> 00:49:44,294
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm thinking more like April at this point.

710
00:49:44,655 --> 00:49:49,339
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe there's something happening there where they want to strategically spread out the first party releases.

711
00:49:49,439 --> 00:49:53,183
[SPEAKER_07]: Plus, I don't think there are a lot of releases on the Wii U right now.

712
00:49:53,503 --> 00:49:58,248
[SPEAKER_07]: We're running into the same situation we did last year where there was nothing coming out for a few months.

713
00:49:58,788 --> 00:50:00,070
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's what we're going to see now.

714
00:50:00,610 --> 00:50:06,317
[SPEAKER_07]: I definitely know there's nothing coming out in December and there's nothing coming out right now in January.

715
00:50:06,337 --> 00:50:09,942
[SPEAKER_10]: Well how does Xbox One and PlayStation 4 look for next year in the winter?

716
00:50:10,022 --> 00:50:13,026
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean aren't they going to be the ones that are kind of hurting for games in the winter?

717
00:50:13,354 --> 00:50:22,176
[SPEAKER_07]: I think everyone's going to run in the same situation, but right now we don't have a firm lineup for what we have for the first quarter of the year.

718
00:50:22,656 --> 00:50:25,397
[SPEAKER_07]: They haven't really announced that stuff yet.

719
00:50:25,417 --> 00:50:32,779
[SPEAKER_07]: Probably later on into the fourth quarter we'll know that because right now their focus is on the fourth quarter.

720
00:50:33,259 --> 00:50:39,521
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think anything's going to get delayed to the beginning part of the year, but they still haven't made their announcements of what titles they have coming up.

721
00:50:40,201 --> 00:50:48,286
[SPEAKER_07]: EA hasn't announced what they really have coming aside from... Yeah, but EA's not a factor on Wii U either.

722
00:50:48,706 --> 00:50:49,106
[SPEAKER_07]: True.

723
00:50:49,506 --> 00:50:50,087
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, very true.

724
00:50:50,107 --> 00:50:51,327
[SPEAKER_07]: Unfortunately.

725
00:50:52,488 --> 00:50:56,270
[SPEAKER_07]: But even like other companies, there's just no big titles that have been announced yet.

726
00:50:56,330 --> 00:50:58,411
[SPEAKER_07]: At least not a lot of titles for February.

727
00:50:58,471 --> 00:51:00,873
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, WhatUpG says Titanfall is next spring, right?

728
00:51:00,953 --> 00:51:01,753
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess that's a big one.

729
00:51:01,813 --> 00:51:03,454
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's more summer.

730
00:51:03,594 --> 00:51:04,955
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think that's coming out in spring at all.

731
00:51:04,975 --> 00:51:05,435
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you think Destiny?

732
00:51:05,435 --> 00:51:06,716
[SPEAKER_10]: I think Destiny's going to be that same time frame too.

733
00:51:06,756 --> 00:51:07,297
[SPEAKER_10]: I know that's a big one.

734
00:51:07,337 --> 00:51:08,018
[SPEAKER_07]: I think Destiny's, yeah.

735
00:51:08,218 --> 00:51:09,179
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe fourth quarter.

736
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:12,081
[SPEAKER_10]: It's second half of the, or at least second quarter, I think.

737
00:51:12,222 --> 00:51:12,622
[SPEAKER_10]: Fair enough.

738
00:51:12,902 --> 00:51:15,485
[SPEAKER_10]: Going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

739
00:51:15,605 --> 00:51:20,890
[SPEAKER_10]: SSJ100Matt says, further proves that their whole E3 conference video just showed 2014 games.

740
00:51:22,131 --> 00:51:24,854
[SPEAKER_10]: Captain Spike says, absolutely gutted about Donkey Kong.

741
00:51:25,174 --> 00:51:26,796
[SPEAKER_10]: One of my most anticipated games of 2013.

742
00:51:28,550 --> 00:51:37,874
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, at least you're still getting a solid platformer in the form of Super Mario 3D World, which some of the early previews are coming back very positive, which is no surprise at all.

743
00:51:38,354 --> 00:51:41,535
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, you know, a lot of the Mario games are very strong performers.

744
00:51:41,675 --> 00:51:42,255
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't think.

745
00:51:42,876 --> 00:51:44,876
[SPEAKER_10]: What was the last one that people didn't like?

746
00:51:45,297 --> 00:51:45,817
[SPEAKER_10]: Sunshine?

747
00:51:45,977 --> 00:51:46,677
[SPEAKER_10]: That was a while ago.

748
00:51:46,957 --> 00:51:47,657
[SPEAKER_11]: Hotel Mario?

749
00:51:48,138 --> 00:51:48,498
[SPEAKER_11]: What's that?

750
00:51:49,298 --> 00:51:50,398
[SPEAKER_11]: Hotel Mario.

751
00:51:50,438 --> 00:51:51,159
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a long time ago.

752
00:51:51,179 --> 00:51:52,139
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, Sunshine was fun.

753
00:51:52,319 --> 00:51:54,559
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, Sunshine still has its defenders.

754
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:57,260
[SPEAKER_10]: I liked Sunshine, actually, myself.

755
00:51:57,400 --> 00:52:00,261
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I mean, most Mario platformers aren't bad.

756
00:52:00,581 --> 00:52:01,161
[SPEAKER_10]: They just aren't.

757
00:52:01,321 --> 00:52:03,282
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, there's been some that are like, that's okay.

758
00:52:03,802 --> 00:52:06,123
[SPEAKER_10]: But most of them are very, very good.

759
00:52:07,783 --> 00:52:13,865
[SPEAKER_10]: So at least you got a solid platformer in that to look forward to in November now in Japan and Europe.

760
00:52:15,085 --> 00:52:19,108
[SPEAKER_10]: Sonic will be coming to Super Smash Brothers, whatever they call it.

761
00:52:19,609 --> 00:52:21,950
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I see you rolling your eyes over there, Loki.

762
00:52:22,110 --> 00:52:25,032
[SPEAKER_10]: I was actually a little surprised because of the fact it's a third-party character.

763
00:52:25,072 --> 00:52:27,554
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't think they'd recycle those, but I guess... Really?

764
00:52:27,654 --> 00:52:33,158
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, because Nintendo's not publishing Mario and Sonic at the Olympics, a game that was a Sega game.

765
00:52:33,398 --> 00:52:34,039
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess.

766
00:52:34,519 --> 00:52:35,760
[SPEAKER_07]: This is not surprising at all.

767
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:36,681
[SPEAKER_07]: It's about surprising.

768
00:52:36,921 --> 00:52:38,462
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, hey, Luigi's in this game.

769
00:52:38,862 --> 00:52:39,042
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh.

770
00:52:39,142 --> 00:52:39,543
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

771
00:52:39,703 --> 00:52:40,103
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

772
00:52:40,163 --> 00:52:40,563
[SPEAKER_07]: Fair enough.

773
00:52:40,583 --> 00:52:42,185
[SPEAKER_07]: More surprising they said he wasn't in the game.

774
00:52:42,405 --> 00:52:42,565
[SPEAKER_07]: Mm-hmm.

775
00:52:42,825 --> 00:52:44,486
[SPEAKER_11]: Next step character, Scarlet Witch.

776
00:52:46,326 --> 00:52:46,767
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's hope.

777
00:52:48,127 --> 00:52:48,547
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see.

778
00:52:48,827 --> 00:52:51,568
[SPEAKER_10]: And Pikmin 3 is getting DLC.

779
00:52:51,968 --> 00:52:57,070
[SPEAKER_10]: Nintendo's kind of further going down the DLC spiral with Pikmin 3 DLC.

780
00:52:57,310 --> 00:52:58,551
[SPEAKER_10]: But a lot of people looking forward to it.

781
00:52:58,571 --> 00:53:02,833
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, I got to say the Super Luigi U was pretty good.

782
00:53:03,213 --> 00:53:06,574
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I mean, if Nintendo can keep making robust DLC packages like that,

783
00:53:06,894 --> 00:53:08,014
[SPEAKER_10]: This isn't a bad thing at all.

784
00:53:08,775 --> 00:53:10,175
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, some folks very excited.

785
00:53:10,275 --> 00:53:17,778
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sure Actdeft was screaming, shaking, crying, and convulsing over the fact that there is a new Kirby game on its way to the 3DS.

786
00:53:19,318 --> 00:53:22,439
[SPEAKER_10]: As if the 3DS needed more powerhouse games, but here's another one.

787
00:53:22,819 --> 00:53:24,960
[SPEAKER_10]: Kirby's on its way, and Loki's going, yep, yep.

788
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:26,301
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I was saying.

789
00:53:26,341 --> 00:53:30,042
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, you know, all these announcements like, wow, more great titles for the 3DS, and then like,

790
00:53:30,262 --> 00:53:30,922
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

791
00:53:54,389 --> 00:53:54,830
[SPEAKER_07]: Outro Music

792
00:54:16,352 --> 00:54:19,233
[SPEAKER_10]: Zelda A Link Between Worlds Dungeons can be played in any order

793
00:54:33,579 --> 00:54:33,899
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura

794
00:54:56,718 --> 00:55:01,386
[SPEAKER_10]: So I would imagine there's still going to be an optimal order, just like in any Mega Man game or something.

795
00:55:01,426 --> 00:55:09,300
[SPEAKER_10]: But the cool thing is it'll kind of open it up for those speed runners and people that like to bend the rules a little bit to try different patterns.

796
00:55:09,340 --> 00:55:10,062
[SPEAKER_10]: So that'll be pretty cool.

797
00:55:10,427 --> 00:55:20,090
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I'm just looking forward to it being just a smash hit and quieting the people who will not shut up about Ocarina of Time slash Majora's Mask.

798
00:55:20,450 --> 00:55:21,811
[SPEAKER_11]: Guys, we all love those games.

799
00:55:22,211 --> 00:55:23,652
[SPEAKER_11]: They're not the only Zelda games.

800
00:55:23,712 --> 00:55:24,252
[SPEAKER_11]: Come on.

801
00:55:24,332 --> 00:55:24,972
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

802
00:55:25,492 --> 00:55:27,253
[SPEAKER_10]: Will you give me a fist bump for that statement?

803
00:55:27,313 --> 00:55:28,293
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much.

804
00:55:28,573 --> 00:55:30,134
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

805
00:55:31,074 --> 00:55:33,295
[SPEAKER_10]: Those games, Ocarina, they have their place, but...

806
00:55:34,656 --> 00:55:35,536
[SPEAKER_10]: Link to the Past

807
00:56:00,794 --> 00:56:07,055
[SPEAKER_10]: When you go there, whoever was last there, their data is on the little machine waiting for you to get it on your 3DS.

808
00:56:07,075 --> 00:56:09,256
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, they're going to upgrade these relay points.

809
00:56:09,816 --> 00:56:12,356
[SPEAKER_10]: Six people now will be on these things.

810
00:56:12,396 --> 00:56:15,217
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you go to Starbucks, you can get up to six people on these things.

811
00:56:15,357 --> 00:56:22,198
[SPEAKER_04]: That's even better because I actually do go to... There's this one that Becky and I go to at least twice a week.

812
00:56:22,419 --> 00:56:22,759
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I know.

813
00:56:22,779 --> 00:56:23,199
[SPEAKER_10]: That's great.

814
00:56:23,279 --> 00:56:23,859
[SPEAKER_10]: That's awesome news.

815
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:28,840
[SPEAKER_10]: And some content distribution events are planned for use over the relay.

816
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:29,080
[SPEAKER_10]: So...

817
00:56:30,881 --> 00:56:31,301
[SPEAKER_10]: Interesting.

818
00:56:32,422 --> 00:56:32,962
[SPEAKER_10]: Very cool stuff.

819
00:56:33,002 --> 00:56:36,705
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess it'll push demos through to your 3DS if you opt in for it, so that'll be really cool.

820
00:56:38,346 --> 00:56:41,068
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, I think you have more Nintendo stuff for us, right?

821
00:56:41,228 --> 00:56:42,689
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm putting my island up.

822
00:56:43,189 --> 00:56:44,150
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I do have other news.

823
00:56:44,690 --> 00:56:47,472
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Actdeft, because I've really been wanting an island for a while.

824
00:56:48,553 --> 00:56:52,697
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, how about the new Wii U firmware?

825
00:56:52,777 --> 00:56:55,019
[SPEAKER_04]: It's also going to have a bunch of other features now.

826
00:56:55,459 --> 00:57:00,084
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be 700 megabytes, so it's going to take a while to download.

827
00:57:00,924 --> 00:57:09,512
[SPEAKER_04]: But it has internet browser updates, it has more demos and trial software, USB keyboard support, Dolby ProLogic 2...

828
00:57:10,933 --> 00:57:31,103
[SPEAKER_04]: Smartphones will be able to connect to the Nintendo Network ID You can view a friends list from the Wii U menu You have your headset that can hook to the gamepad and be used for chat And you can read PDF files on the Wii U And you can also save your passwords for websites So, lots of stuff

829
00:57:31,223 --> 00:57:31,984
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

830
00:57:46,483 --> 00:57:49,465
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, no, I mean, it'll get done in 30 minutes.

831
00:57:49,505 --> 00:57:54,869
[SPEAKER_10]: But my point is, don't wait until the day Mario 3D comes out to do this.

832
00:57:55,469 --> 00:58:06,496
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, if you're listening to my voice and you own a Wii U and you haven't done this yet, you probably just want to go turn that guy on right now and just let the update be over and done with and then be ready for, you know, Zelda Wind Waker HD or whatever the next game is you're going to get.

833
00:58:06,516 --> 00:58:09,719
[SPEAKER_04]: Or get up in the morning, have it update, and call your mom.

834
00:58:10,999 --> 00:58:13,141
[SPEAKER_04]: Or whichever relative you have living right now.

835
00:58:13,721 --> 00:58:14,922
[SPEAKER_10]: Fair enough, fair enough.

836
00:58:15,242 --> 00:58:16,063
[SPEAKER_04]: Talk to them!

837
00:58:17,273 --> 00:58:19,214
[SPEAKER_10]: and go outside and get some fresh air.

838
00:58:20,115 --> 00:58:20,655
[SPEAKER_04]: Get a job.

839
00:58:20,815 --> 00:58:21,796
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, I need to get a job.

840
00:58:22,817 --> 00:58:23,277
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, Loki.

841
00:58:24,558 --> 00:58:24,938
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

842
00:58:26,159 --> 00:58:26,879
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's see here.

843
00:58:26,919 --> 00:58:33,224
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's talk a little bit about PlayStation 3 getting its own firmware update as well.

844
00:58:33,244 --> 00:58:40,789
[SPEAKER_07]: 4.5 finally came out and what it does is adds the auto downloads to people that are not in PlayStation Plus.

845
00:58:41,209 --> 00:58:46,853
[SPEAKER_07]: So you'll be able to also transfer data between your PlayStation 3 and Vita via Wi-Fi.

846
00:58:47,693 --> 00:58:52,257
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and Ethernet connections, I guess originally you can only do it through the transfer cable that they had.

847
00:58:53,738 --> 00:59:00,943
[SPEAKER_07]: And also, um, lets you, uh, set up, I guess, um, groups of players, um, that can see your trophies.

848
00:59:01,644 --> 00:59:03,325
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can either have that open to everybody.

849
00:59:03,505 --> 00:59:12,292
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know why you wouldn't want to, why you would hide your trophies from people unless, unless there was like a trophy for going to the strip club a lot of times and Grand Theft Auto 5 or something, you know, I, I don't know.

850
00:59:13,447 --> 00:59:18,713
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, remember when I was getting all those achievements in Dance Dance Revolution Universe?

851
00:59:18,733 --> 00:59:21,215
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I had it like the day it came out and I started playing it right away.

852
00:59:21,596 --> 00:59:23,998
[SPEAKER_10]: And I got a message from... What was his name?

853
00:59:24,098 --> 00:59:26,301
[SPEAKER_10]: That guy who had all the achievements.

854
00:59:26,321 --> 00:59:30,065
[SPEAKER_10]: He ended up getting banned from Xbox because it turns out they were... Oh, Strip Club DJ.

855
00:59:30,085 --> 00:59:30,565
[SPEAKER_10]: That was his name.

856
00:59:30,946 --> 00:59:34,109
[SPEAKER_10]: He sent me a message like, how are getting the achievements in that game?

857
00:59:34,149 --> 00:59:34,870
[SPEAKER_10]: What's the difficulty?

858
00:59:35,250 --> 00:59:35,471
[SPEAKER_10]: Like...

859
00:59:36,111 --> 00:59:37,373
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't even know how he found me.

860
00:59:37,413 --> 00:59:41,339
[SPEAKER_10]: I think he used one of those websites that shows you who's doing well in achievements.

861
00:59:41,619 --> 00:59:47,127
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think at that moment in time, I had more achievement points in that game than anyone else on release day.

862
00:59:47,608 --> 00:59:51,373
[SPEAKER_10]: So maybe if I'm in that situation again, I want to hide trophies.

863
00:59:51,694 --> 00:59:51,774
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh!

864
00:59:52,515 --> 01:00:06,854
[SPEAKER_10]: it just occurred to me if I'm reviewing games people might ask me to turn that feature on to not spoil because a lot of the trophy lists leak from review copies so maybe that's to encourage critics and so forth to not leak it I bet that would be one

865
01:00:08,548 --> 01:00:09,389
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, they have it.

866
01:00:10,309 --> 01:00:12,150
[SPEAKER_07]: So, cool.

867
01:00:12,910 --> 01:00:15,931
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, so basically, so the auto-download's kind of cool.

868
01:00:16,311 --> 01:00:17,991
[SPEAKER_07]: About time everybody gets that.

869
01:00:18,011 --> 01:00:24,453
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's the thing, okay, and this isn't really PlayStation, but like, you know, speaking of system updates and stuff, fucking 360, man.

870
01:00:24,953 --> 01:00:33,776
[SPEAKER_07]: Every time I log in live now, I'm still getting that fucking prompt to add a second, like, a second method to confirm my passwords or stuff if I need to.

871
01:00:34,636 --> 01:00:36,837
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, like a second way they can contact me, basically.

872
01:00:37,017 --> 01:00:39,738
[SPEAKER_07]: And I've filled it out a bunch of times.

873
01:00:40,018 --> 01:00:44,259
[SPEAKER_07]: And I've even filled it out via texting, via email.

874
01:00:44,819 --> 01:00:48,879
[SPEAKER_07]: And it still fucking says, oh, sorry, you only have one form to contact you.

875
01:00:49,220 --> 01:00:49,960
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you okay with this?

876
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:50,980
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, yes, I'm okay with this.

877
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:54,801
[SPEAKER_07]: Nope, sorry, you need to please add another way to contact us.

878
01:00:54,821 --> 01:00:55,401
[SPEAKER_07]: That's weird.

879
01:00:55,441 --> 01:00:56,961
[SPEAKER_07]: And I even did it through the website.

880
01:00:56,981 --> 01:00:58,902
[SPEAKER_07]: They have a special website you go to to confirm that.

881
01:00:59,082 --> 01:01:00,442
[SPEAKER_07]: Because obviously it says, oh, yeah.

882
01:01:01,282 --> 01:01:02,583
[SPEAKER_07]: You can go ahead and add it through this.

883
01:01:02,703 --> 01:01:03,163
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I'm sorry.

884
01:01:03,203 --> 01:01:04,644
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, no, you can't add it through this.

885
01:01:04,944 --> 01:01:06,604
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to go onto this website to do it.

886
01:01:06,684 --> 01:01:10,826
[SPEAKER_07]: And I did that, and it confirmed it, and it still fucking doesn't work.

887
01:01:10,926 --> 01:01:12,787
[SPEAKER_07]: And I get prompted every fucking time I log in.

888
01:01:12,807 --> 01:01:14,087
[SPEAKER_07]: You need to call Microsoft or something.

889
01:01:14,147 --> 01:01:14,948
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not like something's wrong.

890
01:01:14,968 --> 01:01:17,829
[SPEAKER_07]: You need to fucking flip them off is what I need to do.

891
01:01:17,869 --> 01:01:19,129
[SPEAKER_10]: Aren't you kind of doing that right now?

892
01:01:22,431 --> 01:01:29,894
[SPEAKER_04]: Because Microsoft executives right now and their tech support are listening to the show and going, oh, no, one customer is having a problem.

893
01:01:31,209 --> 01:01:33,710
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I'm a customer that has a podcast.

894
01:01:33,950 --> 01:01:34,691
[SPEAKER_07]: Fear me.

895
01:01:35,271 --> 01:01:36,612
[SPEAKER_10]: He's a loud-ass customer.

896
01:01:36,672 --> 01:01:38,533
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's be real, DarkSakura.

897
01:01:39,093 --> 01:01:39,634
[SPEAKER_10]: So are you.

898
01:01:39,734 --> 01:01:41,174
[SPEAKER_04]: Where everyone has a voice.

899
01:01:41,354 --> 01:01:41,995
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right.

900
01:01:42,175 --> 01:01:44,096
[SPEAKER_04]: And we use our voice to say, fuck you!

901
01:01:45,036 --> 01:01:45,297
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

902
01:01:46,777 --> 01:01:50,479
[SPEAKER_10]: Speaking of consoles and things, one console will be going away.

903
01:01:50,820 --> 01:01:51,700
[SPEAKER_10]: Rest in peace.

904
01:01:52,260 --> 01:01:52,741
[SPEAKER_10]: Bye.

905
01:01:53,781 --> 01:01:55,662
[SPEAKER_10]: It's Nintendo's Wii, believe it or not.

906
01:01:55,702 --> 01:02:00,185
[SPEAKER_10]: Nintendo's Wii will be ending production soon in Japan.

907
01:02:01,385 --> 01:02:03,327
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't have any word about the U.S.

908
01:02:03,447 --> 01:02:05,149
[SPEAKER_10]: or other territories, Canada, Europe.

909
01:02:05,169 --> 01:02:05,569
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't know.

910
01:02:05,929 --> 01:02:09,973
[SPEAKER_10]: But in Japan, let's be real, the Wii isn't selling so hot anymore.

911
01:02:11,334 --> 01:02:14,817
[SPEAKER_10]: 985 Wii units were sold in a week, which really isn't a lot.

912
01:02:15,197 --> 01:02:17,219
[SPEAKER_10]: So the Wii is going to be fading to black.

913
01:02:17,679 --> 01:02:20,081
[SPEAKER_10]: And it kind of makes sense for Nintendo.

914
01:02:20,642 --> 01:02:23,404
[SPEAKER_10]: Push the Wii U. Make people buy that to play the games.

915
01:02:23,424 --> 01:02:24,605
[SPEAKER_10]: It makes sense for them.

916
01:02:24,986 --> 01:02:26,807
[SPEAKER_10]: So, yep, they'll be sunsetting the Wii.

917
01:02:28,749 --> 01:02:38,537
[SPEAKER_10]: I would bet that maybe trying to push the Wii U a little harder, especially in a year where in Japan there's no competition, isn't exactly a bad move.

918
01:02:39,258 --> 01:02:41,700
[SPEAKER_10]: So, nice knowing you, Wii.

919
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:43,902
[SPEAKER_04]: Good not to have yourself as competition.

920
01:02:44,543 --> 01:02:44,823
[SPEAKER_10]: Right?

921
01:02:45,483 --> 01:02:48,504
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, in a way, that's what Nintendo would have right now in Japan.

922
01:02:48,624 --> 01:03:00,949
[SPEAKER_04]: If you think about it in terms of production costs, making a machine that no one's buying, then, yeah, there's no need to keep putting the production money into it when you could be using it for Wii U. I mean, what is going to be on the shelves in Japan?

923
01:03:00,989 --> 01:03:03,210
[SPEAKER_10]: There's Wii U. Now there's not a Wii.

924
01:03:03,570 --> 01:03:06,671
[SPEAKER_10]: There's 360, but in Japan, that's not a factor.

925
01:03:06,691 --> 01:03:06,911
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry.

926
01:03:07,151 --> 01:03:07,811
[SPEAKER_10]: And the PlayStation 3.

927
01:03:09,032 --> 01:03:12,393
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's literally going to be, do you want the new system or the old system?

928
01:03:12,813 --> 01:03:14,134
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the way it is in Japan right now.

929
01:03:14,554 --> 01:03:14,854
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura.com

930
01:03:32,722 --> 01:03:34,723
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, because I'm always good that way.

931
01:03:35,223 --> 01:03:38,685
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, here is something that- How long have you had some of my games?

932
01:03:41,827 --> 01:03:45,208
[SPEAKER_04]: What, you mean that I've actually played?

933
01:03:45,288 --> 01:03:46,849
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just giving you credit.

934
01:03:46,869 --> 01:03:47,369
[SPEAKER_04]: Playing games.

935
01:03:47,850 --> 01:03:48,050
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

936
01:03:48,550 --> 01:03:50,511
[SPEAKER_04]: So, well, this should interest you.

937
01:03:51,371 --> 01:03:52,352
[SPEAKER_04]: You like SimCity, don't you?

938
01:03:53,092 --> 01:03:54,373
[SPEAKER_10]: I like the old SimCity.

939
01:03:54,513 --> 01:03:55,894
[SPEAKER_10]: I like the first SimCity game.

940
01:03:56,274 --> 01:03:58,816
[SPEAKER_10]: I like SimCity Action News on the CD-ROM.

941
01:03:58,856 --> 01:03:59,396
[SPEAKER_10]: Remember that?

942
01:03:59,796 --> 01:04:01,077
[SPEAKER_10]: Do I have to go get those YouTubes?

943
01:04:01,097 --> 01:04:01,637
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I will.

944
01:04:02,878 --> 01:04:03,038
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah!

945
01:04:03,138 --> 01:04:05,379
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a big... No.

946
01:04:06,280 --> 01:04:07,401
[SPEAKER_04]: They should make me a voice actor.

947
01:04:08,922 --> 01:04:12,404
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Maxis is considering an offline mode for SimCity.

948
01:04:13,564 --> 01:04:20,569
[SPEAKER_04]: The note was put on the State of SimCity blog where the Emeryville manager, Patrick Butcher, I guess...

949
01:04:21,229 --> 01:04:35,553
[SPEAKER_04]: is saying that they are considering an offline mode, apparently since a lot of people, yes, Alan, I will check out your Saturn, since a lot of people have been complaining that it is specifically on.

950
01:04:36,193 --> 01:04:42,034
[SPEAKER_04]: The quote says, right now we have a team specifically focused on exploring the possibility of an offline mode.

951
01:04:42,435 --> 01:04:44,155
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't make any promises on when we will have

952
01:04:44,215 --> 01:04:52,192
[SPEAKER_04]: have more information but we know this is something that many of our players have been asking for so who knows maybe it'll be sooner rather than later

953
01:04:52,572 --> 01:04:53,233
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm interested.

954
01:04:54,814 --> 01:04:57,696
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't have the game yet, but I'm interested in offline mode.

955
01:04:58,236 --> 01:05:01,819
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's my concern, because SimCity is starting to come down in price a little bit.

956
01:05:03,080 --> 01:05:10,806
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a feeling that they'll do it as part of an expansion or something to get you to spend the full $60, which, I mean, whatever.

957
01:05:11,106 --> 01:05:17,571
[SPEAKER_10]: I would consider still spending it on an offline SimCity that doesn't require Origin, but we'll see.

958
01:05:18,581 --> 01:05:29,903
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, well, I honestly, and just on the same note, I wish that there would be updates across the board for all of them so you don't have to use Origin, but that's me.

959
01:05:31,344 --> 01:05:32,804
[SPEAKER_04]: And everybody else that plays Mass Effect 3.

960
01:05:34,304 --> 01:05:41,166
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, traveling around the world and checking out some release dates, things that will be coming a little sooner than SimCity Offline Mode.

961
01:05:41,246 --> 01:05:41,446
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki.

962
01:05:42,183 --> 01:05:46,127
[SPEAKER_07]: This week on PlayStation 3, we have Beyond Two Souls coming out.

963
01:05:47,188 --> 01:05:53,255
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, Borderlands 2 Game of the Year Edition making its way out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.

964
01:05:54,055 --> 01:05:56,718
[SPEAKER_07]: Disgaea D2, A Brighter Darkness on PlayStation 3.

965
01:05:56,778 --> 01:06:02,604
[SPEAKER_07]: The Capcom Essentials Collection on Xbox 360 and PS3.

966
01:06:03,826 --> 01:06:04,967
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a bunch of old games, by the way.

967
01:06:06,307 --> 01:06:31,914
[SPEAKER_07]: Just Dance 2014 on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, and Wii U Dishonored Game of the Year Edition on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC and then let's see here also on Saturday it's a small portable game called Pokemon X and Y those will be coming out in 3DS

968
01:06:32,904 --> 01:06:33,884
[SPEAKER_07]: Might sell a couple copies.

969
01:06:33,925 --> 01:06:35,845
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, they may make a couple.

970
01:06:36,846 --> 01:06:42,528
[SPEAKER_07]: And then on Sunday, they have Skylanders Swap Force.

971
01:06:43,349 --> 01:06:48,431
[SPEAKER_07]: It's new because you can take the top part of the character and put it on the bottom part of another character.

972
01:06:48,831 --> 01:06:49,992
[SPEAKER_07]: Woo!

973
01:06:50,172 --> 01:06:51,152
[SPEAKER_07]: Innovation!

974
01:06:51,172 --> 01:06:51,633
[SPEAKER_07]: Swapping!

975
01:06:51,793 --> 01:06:52,553
[SPEAKER_07]: And jumping!

976
01:06:52,593 --> 01:06:53,834
[SPEAKER_07]: You can jump now!

977
01:06:53,914 --> 01:06:54,014
[SPEAKER_07]: Woo!

978
01:06:56,166 --> 01:06:57,968
[SPEAKER_07]: Sell me a thousand copies already.

979
01:06:58,229 --> 01:07:01,754
[SPEAKER_10]: It will sell much more than a thousand copies.

980
01:07:02,816 --> 01:07:10,227
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, so... Hey, you know, my five-year-old nephew is nuts about that game, so... Has your five-year-old nephew checked out Disney Infinity as well?

981
01:07:11,042 --> 01:07:31,086
[SPEAKER_07]: I have permanently disbarred him from anything Disney related online so no wow this sounds like a story I'd like to see I also want to mention that also on Saturday that coincide with the Pokemon X and Y on the 3DS you can buy a 2DS one less DS in there

982
01:07:31,664 --> 01:07:38,106
[SPEAKER_07]: If 3D is too much for you... If the 3D will blow your mind, the 2D will just kind of simmer your mind.

983
01:07:38,246 --> 01:07:45,948
[SPEAKER_10]: I am hearing, take it with a grain of salt, but I am hearing that the 2DS, a lot of people kind of like the way it feels when they play it, for what it's worth.

984
01:07:46,248 --> 01:07:51,710
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, despite the fact that a lot of people have been very critical about the design and how it doesn't fold the same way and so forth.

985
01:07:52,070 --> 01:07:55,411
[SPEAKER_10]: Hearing a lot of positive feedback about kind of how it feels when it's in your hands, so...

986
01:07:56,431 --> 01:08:09,506
[SPEAKER_07]: I like to mention though, even though I do happen to peruse the Evil G website for some release dates sometimes, I am kind of confused at why they're selling GoPro accessories for GameStop

987
01:08:11,368 --> 01:08:12,409
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know, I don't know

988
01:08:27,943 --> 01:08:54,594
[SPEAKER_10]: Also coming out in Japan on the 10th, F1 2013, Grand Theft Auto V's Japanese release, Mineno Golf 6 gets a best release, a price reduction, Sakatsuku Pro Soccer Club Osukoru comes out from Sega, and Tales of Symphonia, the Unisonant Pack comes out in, there's like a regular, there's a Famitsu Deluxe Pack, and there's a Lala Bit Market Limited Edition Pack.

989
01:08:55,214 --> 01:08:56,095
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's all that.

990
01:08:56,275 --> 01:08:58,236
[SPEAKER_10]: If you're Tales of Symphonia, looking forward to that.

991
01:08:58,777 --> 01:09:05,521
[SPEAKER_10]: Also worth mentioning, a game called Fairy Fencer F comes out from Compile in a regular and limited edition.

992
01:09:06,822 --> 01:09:08,544
[SPEAKER_10]: Fairy Fencer, is that like fencing?

993
01:09:08,844 --> 01:09:10,645
[SPEAKER_10]: Like what you see in the Olympics?

994
01:09:10,685 --> 01:09:12,727
[SPEAKER_04]: You put them on a spike.

995
01:09:13,467 --> 01:09:13,847
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

996
01:09:34,432 --> 01:09:36,233
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, by fairies, do you mean vocaloids?

997
01:09:36,253 --> 01:09:37,433
[SPEAKER_11]: Because that's what they look more like.

998
01:09:37,854 --> 01:09:38,754
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it might be.

999
01:09:39,234 --> 01:09:39,854
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not sure.

1000
01:09:39,954 --> 01:09:41,975
[SPEAKER_10]: But fairy fencing.

1001
01:09:42,296 --> 01:09:45,257
[SPEAKER_10]: They're fencing your face off, basically, if you're that grizzly bear.

1002
01:09:45,337 --> 01:09:46,097
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a fenced.

1003
01:09:46,457 --> 01:09:46,837
Wait.

1004
01:09:49,048 --> 01:09:53,312
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, let's see what's coming out on other systems in Japan this week.

1005
01:09:53,852 --> 01:09:56,314
[SPEAKER_10]: Moving on over to the Xbox 360.

1006
01:09:56,555 --> 01:10:12,189
[SPEAKER_10]: Haha, I know, but there are still things coming out, including Grand Theft Auto V, F1 2013, the Batman Arkham Pack, and there's an Xbox Live 12-month, 2-gold membership card that comes with Grand Theft Auto V. I don't really know what that means, but that is something that is happening in Japan.

1007
01:10:12,789 --> 01:10:14,511
[SPEAKER_10]: They probably had something similar here, I just missed it.

1008
01:10:15,191 --> 01:10:16,451
[SPEAKER_10]: on the PlayStation Vita this week.

1009
01:10:16,511 --> 01:10:18,972
[SPEAKER_10]: Dream Club Zero Portable gets a price reduction.

1010
01:10:19,932 --> 01:10:24,193
[SPEAKER_10]: A new game called Getsui Gakuen Kou comes out this week.

1011
01:10:24,213 --> 01:10:24,653
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait, wait, wait, what?

1012
01:10:25,293 --> 01:10:29,234
[SPEAKER_10]: Getsui Gakuen Kou comes out this week.

1013
01:10:29,254 --> 01:10:29,974
[SPEAKER_03]: Gakuen is cool.

1014
01:10:30,494 --> 01:10:31,494
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I see what that looks like?

1015
01:10:31,734 --> 01:10:32,474
[SPEAKER_10]: You sure can.

1016
01:10:32,875 --> 01:10:33,255
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1017
01:10:33,335 --> 01:10:36,035
[SPEAKER_10]: This is the one screenshot I have.

1018
01:10:37,315 --> 01:10:39,536
[SPEAKER_10]: Unless this other, let me check out this other page.

1019
01:10:39,576 --> 01:10:40,096
[SPEAKER_10]: Might have more.

1020
01:10:40,643 --> 01:10:41,504
[SPEAKER_03]: Some school thing.

1021
01:10:41,524 --> 01:10:43,025
[SPEAKER_10]: Fantastic radio here we have.

1022
01:10:43,045 --> 01:10:44,226
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that has an extra screenshot.

1023
01:10:44,886 --> 01:10:46,147
[SPEAKER_10]: Or that just shows what it comes with.

1024
01:10:46,427 --> 01:10:46,527
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh.

1025
01:10:46,827 --> 01:10:48,449
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I want to see what the limited edition comes with.

1026
01:10:48,469 --> 01:10:51,131
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I thought I've heard of it before, but I don't remember offhand.

1027
01:10:51,351 --> 01:10:51,631
[SPEAKER_10]: Aha.

1028
01:10:51,811 --> 01:10:58,516
[SPEAKER_10]: It looks like they get the game, a book, maybe a school book, a music CD, and trading cards?

1029
01:10:59,116 --> 01:10:59,416
[SPEAKER_04]: Stickers?

1030
01:10:59,436 --> 01:11:00,457
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a drama CD.

1031
01:11:03,279 --> 01:11:08,663
[SPEAKER_04]: No, the CD is basically like a play, like radio drama.

1032
01:11:09,545 --> 01:11:33,417
[SPEAKER_10]: so maybe this is like based off some type of drama series maybe all right uh also on the PlayStation Vita Metal Gear Solid HD edition getting a price reduction uh and I think some new Vita equipment comes out this week is this the week of the Vita Slim model it is so this is the week where you're black khaki black light blue white light lime green white pink black white and black

1033
01:11:33,797 --> 01:11:35,178
[SPEAKER_10]: Slim Models all come out.

1034
01:11:35,498 --> 01:11:37,338
[SPEAKER_10]: So no wonder there's so much on the Vita this week.

1035
01:11:38,699 --> 01:11:40,079
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my gosh, there's Slaughter Mania 5.

1036
01:11:40,899 --> 01:11:42,420
[SPEAKER_10]: Like slaughter, like slot machines.

1037
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:44,661
[SPEAKER_10]: Not like I'm going to go kill a bunch of zombies, Slaughter Mania.

1038
01:11:45,841 --> 01:11:48,522
[SPEAKER_10]: Uncharted Golden Abyss gets a re-release in the best hits.

1039
01:11:49,262 --> 01:11:51,083
[SPEAKER_10]: Soul Sacrifice gets a re-release.

1040
01:11:52,103 --> 01:11:58,125
[SPEAKER_10]: And then Sakatsuku Pro Soccer Club Oh Sukru comes out this week also.

1041
01:11:58,205 --> 01:12:00,286
[SPEAKER_10]: So lots of stuff going on on the Vita this week.

1042
01:12:01,974 --> 01:12:05,617
[SPEAKER_10]: Now that makes sense, now that I see that the Vita Slim is out this week.

1043
01:12:05,777 --> 01:12:07,218
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm sure there'll be some people here for that.

1044
01:12:07,618 --> 01:12:11,841
[SPEAKER_10]: On the Wii U, sadly nothing to report this week, but Rayman Legends coming up next week.

1045
01:12:12,241 --> 01:12:13,242
[SPEAKER_10]: You got a little time.

1046
01:12:14,043 --> 01:12:18,966
[SPEAKER_10]: And on the Nintendo 3DS this week, Pokemon X and Y is also on Japan.

1047
01:12:19,026 --> 01:12:20,207
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like a worldwide release.

1048
01:12:21,008 --> 01:12:23,409
[SPEAKER_10]: Also a big release for them on the 12th.

1049
01:12:23,670 --> 01:12:26,371
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's all sorts of accessories.

1050
01:12:26,792 --> 01:12:29,133
[SPEAKER_10]: You can get Froakie pens.

1051
01:12:30,114 --> 01:12:36,955
[SPEAKER_10]: You can get Chesapeed pouch, Chespin, excuse me, pouches and Lord knows what else.

1052
01:12:37,035 --> 01:12:37,496
[SPEAKER_10]: There you go.

1053
01:12:37,976 --> 01:12:40,656
[SPEAKER_10]: All that coming out in Japan this week on the 3DS.

1054
01:12:41,436 --> 01:12:42,096
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura?

1055
01:12:43,097 --> 01:12:47,618
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we have a pretty slender selection for the UK.

1056
01:12:48,198 --> 01:12:58,320
[SPEAKER_04]: On the 9th there's Montague's Mount for PC and stupid thing reloaded and on the 11th we have Beyond Two Souls for PS3.

1057
01:12:58,580 --> 01:12:59,140
[SPEAKER_04]: That's about it.

1058
01:13:00,538 --> 01:13:02,279
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, just a couple more news stories for you guys.

1059
01:13:02,299 --> 01:13:04,441
[SPEAKER_10]: And then the classic game of the week.

1060
01:13:04,761 --> 01:13:06,022
[SPEAKER_04]: And it will surprise no one.

1061
01:13:06,782 --> 01:13:07,122
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki.

1062
01:13:08,323 --> 01:13:08,643
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1063
01:13:10,745 --> 01:13:11,505
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's see here.

1064
01:13:12,806 --> 01:13:23,713
[SPEAKER_07]: SNK, they are getting rid of the Neo Geo X. You may remember the Neo Geo X is kind of that rebuild, I guess, of the classic Neo Geo.

1065
01:13:24,693 --> 01:13:29,395
[SPEAKER_07]: They also had this portable system that was plugged into this dock.

1066
01:13:30,736 --> 01:13:32,176
[SPEAKER_07]: It was kind of emulating everything.

1067
01:13:34,197 --> 01:13:45,142
[SPEAKER_07]: But now they have cease and desist against the website that sells the Neo Geo X. I guess they were saying that the notice, which appeared on October 2nd,

1068
01:13:45,982 --> 01:14:03,816
[SPEAKER_07]: Demands an immediate cease and desist of manufacturing, distribution, promotion, and selling of the Neo Geo X Gold Limited Edition Mega Pack Volume 1 and Classic Volumes 1 through 5, as well as the Neo Geo X Arcade Stick, in order to protect our intellectual property rights, such as Neo Geo and SNK.

1069
01:14:04,657 --> 01:14:13,520
[SPEAKER_07]: See, here I thought, me being naive, I guess, that they had the go-ahead to go ahead and make that stuff since it had SNK on it and it was a fucking Neo Geo.

1070
01:14:14,120 --> 01:14:15,300
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, at least it looked like one.

1071
01:14:16,061 --> 01:14:17,661
[SPEAKER_07]: Come to find out, they didn't.

1072
01:14:17,941 --> 01:14:19,642
[SPEAKER_07]: They just kind of put it out there anyways.

1073
01:14:19,822 --> 01:14:20,302
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

1074
01:14:21,022 --> 01:14:22,023
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been out for a while, too.

1075
01:14:22,043 --> 01:14:24,425
[SPEAKER_10]: I was going to say, I forgot the thing even came out.

1076
01:14:24,485 --> 01:14:25,426
[SPEAKER_10]: How horrible is that?

1077
01:14:25,926 --> 01:14:27,768
[SPEAKER_10]: But, I mean, they've recycled those Neo Geo games.

1078
01:14:27,788 --> 01:14:32,832
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, a ton of them are available on Virtual Console and PlayStation 3 download.

1079
01:14:32,872 --> 01:14:37,275
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, you know, if you want something a little more authentic, I guess you could get this.

1080
01:14:37,375 --> 01:14:41,518
[SPEAKER_04]: But, I mean... Keep in mind, those licensed ones, SNK gets money for.

1081
01:14:41,839 --> 01:14:42,139
[SPEAKER_04]: True.

1082
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:47,183
[SPEAKER_04]: They would get no money if they didn't provide their license.

1083
01:14:48,194 --> 01:14:49,235
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, here's what it is.

1084
01:14:49,395 --> 01:14:49,955
[SPEAKER_07]: I get it now.

1085
01:14:50,595 --> 01:14:54,097
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess it was licensed because Tomo was the one that was putting it out.

1086
01:14:54,117 --> 01:14:55,998
[SPEAKER_07]: They do a lot of license weird shit.

1087
01:14:57,039 --> 01:15:01,922
[SPEAKER_07]: But now they're ending their license agreement, so it's no longer going to be sold after the 2nd.

1088
01:15:02,262 --> 01:15:02,542
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.

1089
01:15:03,903 --> 01:15:04,743
[SPEAKER_07]: The 2nd of October?

1090
01:15:05,104 --> 01:15:05,404
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1091
01:15:05,484 --> 01:15:06,264
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, then it's done.

1092
01:15:06,464 --> 01:15:07,105
[SPEAKER_07]: It's done, yes.

1093
01:15:09,266 --> 01:15:09,827
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1094
01:15:29,878 --> 01:15:30,379
[SPEAKER_07]: No company for E.T.

1095
01:15:30,419 --> 01:15:30,819
[SPEAKER_07]: down there.

1096
01:15:30,879 --> 01:15:31,940
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll stick with my Neo Geo.

1097
01:15:53,971 --> 01:15:54,972
[SPEAKER_10]: You got the real thing, though.

1098
01:15:55,012 --> 01:15:57,275
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, why even bother with this stuff if you have the real thing?

1099
01:15:57,315 --> 01:15:59,177
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it has the games loaded on the system.

1100
01:15:59,457 --> 01:16:00,478
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess that's true.

1101
01:16:00,538 --> 01:16:02,921
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know how much I paid for the last cartridge I bought?

1102
01:16:03,841 --> 01:16:06,785
[SPEAKER_04]: We paid $300 for, what was the last one we got?

1103
01:16:07,125 --> 01:16:07,605
[SPEAKER_04]: King of Fighters 2000.

1104
01:16:08,496 --> 01:16:10,917
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

1105
01:16:10,957 --> 01:16:11,797
[SPEAKER_04]: When I had money.

1106
01:16:11,817 --> 01:16:13,318
[SPEAKER_07]: It blows me away how much those cartridges cost.

1107
01:16:13,358 --> 01:16:18,759
[SPEAKER_07]: I like the bootleg ones, the 48-in-1s, the 107, where there's a ton of them on one cartridge.

1108
01:16:19,019 --> 01:16:19,520
[SPEAKER_07]: Bobby knows.

1109
01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:21,400
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1110
01:16:22,380 --> 01:16:26,782
[SPEAKER_10]: One more story about Terraria, which has its hardcore fans.

1111
01:16:27,082 --> 01:16:30,343
[SPEAKER_10]: I saw Terraria on PlayStation 3 this weekend.

1112
01:16:30,383 --> 01:16:33,144
[SPEAKER_10]: I was at Fry's randomly when I got the capture box.

1113
01:16:33,444 --> 01:16:35,645
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1114
01:16:54,791 --> 01:16:56,032
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a thing that's happening.

1115
01:16:56,713 --> 01:17:07,540
[SPEAKER_10]: Andrew Spinks, the creator of Terraria, talked about Terraria 2, saying, It is definitely something that will be happening, but contrary to several of the articles that went live today, I have not started development.

1116
01:17:08,020 --> 01:17:13,123
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a list of features and mechanics I want the game to have, but that is the extent of the development at this point.

1117
01:17:13,504 --> 01:17:16,266
[SPEAKER_10]: So, in other words, he's going to do it.

1118
01:17:16,726 --> 01:17:18,847
[SPEAKER_10]: It's announced in that regard, but that's it.

1119
01:17:19,107 --> 01:17:22,730
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't have anything else, so don't plan on this happening anytime soon.

1120
01:17:24,891 --> 01:17:25,351
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see.

1121
01:17:25,592 --> 01:17:38,477
[SPEAKER_10]: Also in the interview, mentioned that version 1.2 will be the last seven-month update for the original game, but that he will change the endgame up for the update within the next month or two because there was no final boss.

1122
01:17:39,077 --> 01:17:42,239
[SPEAKER_10]: And there may be some other smaller updates a few more months down the line.

1123
01:17:42,999 --> 01:17:48,501
[SPEAKER_10]: He might hire a team to do some updates, but he'll be focusing on Terraria 2 soon.

1124
01:17:49,282 --> 01:17:49,782
[SPEAKER_10]: So there you go.

1125
01:17:50,422 --> 01:17:52,163
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, you played a little bit of Terraria, right?

1126
01:17:52,183 --> 01:17:52,263
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1127
01:17:52,580 --> 01:17:52,940
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura

1128
01:18:16,075 --> 01:18:16,756
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura.com

1129
01:18:46,437 --> 01:18:48,019
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a life sim game.

1130
01:18:48,600 --> 01:18:50,623
[SPEAKER_04]: And I miss this music, Rob.

1131
01:18:51,324 --> 01:18:52,105
[SPEAKER_04]: The old school music.

1132
01:18:53,587 --> 01:18:54,148
[SPEAKER_04]: Wasn't it good?

1133
01:18:54,168 --> 01:18:55,409
[SPEAKER_08]: It was good.

1134
01:19:01,061 --> 01:19:03,743
[SPEAKER_04]: I was actually running around the house making up lyrics to this to Midna.

1135
01:19:04,083 --> 01:19:05,403
[SPEAKER_04]: She was looking at me like I was insane.

1136
01:19:06,304 --> 01:19:08,205
[SPEAKER_09]: She probably does that a lot, I bet.

1137
01:19:08,405 --> 01:19:08,825
[SPEAKER_09]: Shut up.

1138
01:19:09,466 --> 01:19:18,070
[SPEAKER_04]: So anyway, and of course the one that I linked on here is actually the Nintendo 64 one, which was the very first Dobutsu no Mori.

1139
01:19:20,171 --> 01:19:25,814
[SPEAKER_04]: It came out in Japan on April 14th, 2001, and came out on the GameCube as Animal Force Plus.

1140
01:19:26,994 --> 01:19:27,094
[SPEAKER_04]: In

1141
01:19:30,410 --> 01:19:31,951
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1142
01:19:58,262 --> 01:20:02,745
[SPEAKER_04]: So the game itself is... No, Bobby, I'm not doing Halo.

1143
01:20:03,705 --> 01:20:07,668
[SPEAKER_04]: So the game itself has evolved over time.

1144
01:20:08,588 --> 01:20:16,053
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm going to focus on the GameCube one since that is probably the one the majority of us have started with.

1145
01:20:16,634 --> 01:20:26,580
[SPEAKER_04]: So with the very first game, and it was like this on the Nintendo 64 as well, you would arrive in town homeless.

1146
01:20:28,523 --> 01:20:37,135
[SPEAKER_04]: and get forced into indentured servitude by the evil Tom Nook, who is the mobster boss of your town.

1147
01:20:37,999 --> 01:20:42,582
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, in all reality, you know, it's a very open-ended game.

1148
01:20:42,642 --> 01:20:43,242
[SPEAKER_04]: It keeps going.

1149
01:20:43,282 --> 01:20:45,483
[SPEAKER_04]: You have different holidays in town.

1150
01:20:45,963 --> 01:20:49,065
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to, you know, earn money and pay off your mortgage.

1151
01:20:49,725 --> 01:20:51,406
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can expand your house.

1152
01:20:52,667 --> 01:20:53,607
[SPEAKER_10]: No, no, no, no.

1153
01:20:53,687 --> 01:20:55,988
[SPEAKER_10]: People were there to collect NES games.

1154
01:20:56,089 --> 01:20:57,089
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what they were there for.

1155
01:20:57,209 --> 01:20:58,430
[SPEAKER_04]: I was getting to that.

1156
01:20:58,530 --> 01:21:00,171
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, I can't contain myself.

1157
01:21:01,211 --> 01:21:01,632
[SPEAKER_04]: Rab.

1158
01:21:02,832 --> 01:21:14,160
[SPEAKER_04]: So anyway, you have to, you know, you earn bells, which is the in-game currency, pay off your loan, and in the... And you hit villagers with bug nets.

1159
01:21:14,594 --> 01:21:17,315
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I keep hitting that fucker Ed with a bug net and he won't move.

1160
01:21:18,535 --> 01:21:21,236
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not the only one having to deal with Ed, by the way.

1161
01:21:22,456 --> 01:21:23,336
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a dumb horse.

1162
01:21:23,617 --> 01:21:29,278
[SPEAKER_04]: So anyway, you also could collect Nintendo Entertainment games.

1163
01:21:30,198 --> 01:21:40,881
[SPEAKER_04]: And as far as I'm aware, I think this just popped up in... I want to say just in the GameCube ones.

1164
01:21:42,042 --> 01:21:42,122
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

1165
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:44,941
[SPEAKER_04]: Ice Climber, Mario Bros.

1166
01:21:45,061 --> 01:21:45,322
[SPEAKER_04]: e-reader

1167
01:22:02,519 --> 01:22:26,709
[SPEAKER_04]: um so yeah there were different multiplayer modes as well where you could have up to four people living in the village um you couldn't play at the same time as anybody else but you could take turns like Dan and I would see who could pay off our mortgage faster and who got the gold statue and who got the silver statue and finally I'm like bitch make your own town so he has Danville that was his town

1168
01:22:28,673 --> 01:22:31,916
[SPEAKER_04]: Robville or something silly.

1169
01:22:52,596 --> 01:22:54,558
[SPEAKER_04]: Dan had Danville because Danville exists.

1170
01:22:55,498 --> 01:23:01,163
[SPEAKER_04]: You could also leave messages to each other on the big board that's in the center of town.

1171
01:23:02,824 --> 01:23:04,465
[SPEAKER_04]: I still do that when I visit people's towns.

1172
01:23:04,605 --> 01:23:05,986
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll say, hey, Jamie was here.

1173
01:23:06,246 --> 01:23:07,708
[SPEAKER_04]: So-and-so sucks.

1174
01:23:07,808 --> 01:23:08,548
[SPEAKER_04]: Steal Ed from me.

1175
01:23:08,828 --> 01:23:10,069
[SPEAKER_04]: Still trying to steal Kabuki from you.

1176
01:23:12,291 --> 01:23:13,532
[SPEAKER_04]: Now this I wanted to play a little bit. ...

1177
01:23:18,121 --> 01:23:20,163
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you hear how the voice sounds?

1178
01:23:21,904 --> 01:23:28,989
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, in the Japanese version, basically, they say every syllable, every kana.

1179
01:23:29,890 --> 01:23:35,054
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can actually, I mean, it's really sped up and fast, but you can actually kind of pick out what they're saying.

1180
01:23:35,755 --> 01:23:42,420
[SPEAKER_04]: For the American, for the English versions, basically, they say each letter, so it really does sound like a bunch of gibberish.

1181
01:23:43,601 --> 01:23:43,681
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

1182
01:23:45,222 --> 01:23:50,265
[SPEAKER_04]: And the voices, of course, went a little bit differently because I had to redo them to say each of the letters.

1183
01:23:51,446 --> 01:24:00,051
[SPEAKER_04]: You had another thing that was only in the earlier ones, and that was Mr. Resetti, or as he was called in Japan, I think he was Resetsan.

1184
01:24:00,992 --> 01:24:07,876
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you turned off your game without saving, the next time you turned it on, he'd pop out of the ground and berate you for like an hour.

1185
01:24:07,916 --> 01:24:10,038
[SPEAKER_04]: So basically he annoyed you into not doing it again.

1186
01:24:11,759 --> 01:24:22,502
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, the part that's showing on the video right now, if you can kind of hear some of it, is where you talk to Rover, who basically, he asks you questions, and depending on how you answer it, determines what your looks are.

1187
01:24:23,202 --> 01:24:27,603
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I always cheat and use an FAQ so that my character will look how I want her to look.

1188
01:24:29,483 --> 01:24:34,404
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, with the GameCube One, you could also use the Game Boy Advance to do stuff on the island.

1189
01:24:35,084 --> 01:24:36,425
[SPEAKER_04]: You were able to...

1190
01:24:38,726 --> 01:24:39,986
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching.

1191
01:24:40,006 --> 01:24:40,447
[SPEAKER_04]: See you next time.

1192
01:25:01,258 --> 01:25:17,203
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, there's another thing that is still one of my favorite parts of the game, is that you had a character who, in the Japanese version, his name was Todakeke, who, if I remember right, he was named after a music composer.

1193
01:25:18,364 --> 01:25:19,184
[SPEAKER_04]: Over here, he's K.K.

1194
01:25:19,204 --> 01:25:19,484
[SPEAKER_04]: Slider.

1195
01:25:20,838 --> 01:25:24,539
[SPEAKER_04]: and he would sing different songs.

1196
01:25:24,619 --> 01:25:28,119
[SPEAKER_04]: In the old ones he would sing in, I believe it was the Town Square.

1197
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,940
[SPEAKER_04]: In later versions he'd also sing at the Roost Cafe.

1198
01:25:32,440 --> 01:25:41,122
[SPEAKER_04]: Now he actually has Club Lowell where he sings on Saturday nights and you listen to the song and you can get a demo version and now the stores actually sell his music.

1199
01:25:41,582 --> 01:25:46,783
[SPEAKER_04]: You can also use the music as the album art on your wall as a poster.

1200
01:25:47,603 --> 01:25:50,004
[SPEAKER_04]: But going back to the... Okay, here it is.

1201
01:25:50,104 --> 01:25:53,065
[SPEAKER_04]: It was actually Totaka Kazumi.

1202
01:25:53,725 --> 01:25:55,506
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's where Todakeke's name came from.

1203
01:25:57,206 --> 01:26:02,948
[SPEAKER_04]: At any rate, the game had absolutely adorable music.

1204
01:26:03,008 --> 01:26:04,228
[SPEAKER_04]: Just really neat songs.

1205
01:26:04,268 --> 01:26:08,430
[SPEAKER_04]: You had all kinds of genre represented in Todakeke's music.

1206
01:26:10,230 --> 01:26:13,651
[SPEAKER_04]: And then just the background music was really iconic.

1207
01:26:13,711 --> 01:26:15,132
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, to this day, I still...

1208
01:26:15,672 --> 01:26:16,213
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1209
01:26:37,373 --> 01:26:49,861
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'm not going to say these are officially a collectible item, but you get the Honeywa, which we got as gyroids, which after it rained, you could dig them up in the ground because back in the old school days, Honeywa were buried with the dead.

1210
01:26:50,521 --> 01:26:52,882
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's why you dig them up out of the ground.

1211
01:26:54,303 --> 01:27:05,009
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and AlphaKineticGram also wants to point out that, um, Totaka has, um, his, uh, song, which actually is in the game as K.K.

1212
01:27:05,029 --> 01:27:05,349
[SPEAKER_04]: Song.

1213
01:27:06,030 --> 01:27:12,433
[SPEAKER_04]: The little hidden thing that was also in Mario Paint and all the different, you know, things that he ever did sound design for.

1214
01:27:13,654 --> 01:27:14,294
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um...

1215
01:27:15,965 --> 01:27:17,666
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1216
01:27:45,683 --> 01:27:49,830
[SPEAKER_04]: You had the police dog's copper.

1217
01:27:50,451 --> 01:27:51,533
[SPEAKER_04]: And what was the other one's name?

1218
01:27:51,713 --> 01:27:52,715
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't remember the other one's name.

1219
01:27:55,078 --> 01:27:55,619
[SPEAKER_04]: There were...

1220
01:27:57,768 --> 01:28:00,829
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we have Isabelle and Digby in the newer ones.

1221
01:28:01,669 --> 01:28:08,771
[SPEAKER_04]: Isabelle is your... Apparently she never sleeps because she is at the stupid town hall all the damn time.

1222
01:28:09,492 --> 01:28:10,932
[SPEAKER_04]: You could change your town theme.

1223
01:28:11,252 --> 01:28:12,393
[SPEAKER_04]: You could change catchphrases.

1224
01:28:13,013 --> 01:28:16,454
[SPEAKER_04]: We used to make people say some really dirty ass things and Nintendo finally got smart.

1225
01:28:16,974 --> 01:28:19,335
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I might have been an offender with that.

1226
01:28:20,623 --> 01:28:29,250
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I've got Rowan going around wearing the Link outfit saying kitty fuck.

1227
01:28:29,691 --> 01:28:33,233
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we used to have Dina, remember Dina?

1228
01:28:33,334 --> 01:28:38,458
[SPEAKER_04]: She apparently is no longer a gym teacher, but a music teacher.

1229
01:28:39,459 --> 01:28:40,419
[SPEAKER_04]: She's a folk singer, Rob.

1230
01:28:41,180 --> 01:28:41,841
[SPEAKER_04]: Staying with her ways.

1231
01:28:44,443 --> 01:28:48,028
[SPEAKER_04]: All of your different villagers, you've got different types of personalities.

1232
01:28:48,048 --> 01:28:57,138
[SPEAKER_04]: They actually brought back the big sister personality, the perky, and the friendly older brother personality that were in earlier games.

1233
01:28:58,399 --> 01:29:16,350
[SPEAKER_04]: and different characters that go back and forth now the other thing with this is it is and I've mentioned this before Bobby Bobby said he made all this town people say just ignore him Halo classic game of the year it's not gonna happen he's trolling you and it's working I know but I'm just laughing at him because he's still trying and it's just not funny um

1234
01:29:19,961 --> 01:29:24,886
[SPEAKER_04]: I've made Ed say I totally suck is his greeting, and then his catchphrase is I really suck.

1235
01:29:26,408 --> 01:29:27,249
[SPEAKER_04]: I fucking hate Ed.

1236
01:29:29,111 --> 01:29:35,237
[SPEAKER_04]: In the newer ones you've got, like, you can have a campsite where people can visit and they'll play stupid games and steal your money, fuckers.

1237
01:29:36,158 --> 01:29:38,079
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, just all kinds of stuff to do.

1238
01:29:39,399 --> 01:29:43,900
[SPEAKER_04]: I mentioned the island, and I can't help it.

1239
01:29:44,580 --> 01:29:46,881
[SPEAKER_04]: I've had so much fun with the first game.

1240
01:29:46,961 --> 01:29:59,744
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, to bring up what I was talking about, about the dialogue, since Japanese is basically a syllabic alphabet, I picked up the GameCube one in Japanese to practice my reading.

1241
01:30:00,624 --> 01:30:03,386
[SPEAKER_04]: And lo and behold, my reading actually improved.

1242
01:30:03,426 --> 01:30:07,910
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I'm way out of practice now, but it was a very, very good educational tool.

1243
01:30:07,930 --> 01:30:17,257
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm actually offering this out here to anyone who happens to be a beginner learner who's wanting to practice your reading to understand grammar and syntax.

1244
01:30:17,978 --> 01:30:20,200
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, get Animal Crossing on GameCube.

1245
01:30:20,360 --> 01:30:22,521
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, use it to import other copies.

1246
01:30:23,102 --> 01:30:26,705
[SPEAKER_04]: It will really, really, really help your reading comprehension in Japanese.

1247
01:30:27,365 --> 01:30:31,446
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's not kanji heavy, so you don't have to really worry about it.

1248
01:30:32,526 --> 01:30:36,027
[SPEAKER_04]: So, anyway, there's so much to do.

1249
01:30:36,147 --> 01:30:37,528
[SPEAKER_04]: The original was fun.

1250
01:30:38,268 --> 01:30:39,208
[SPEAKER_04]: The newer ones are fun.

1251
01:30:39,248 --> 01:30:51,332
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, they kind of got stale with City Folk and Wild World, but I think that the last one, New Leaf, really has brought back a lot of the fun that was in the game.

1252
01:30:51,352 --> 01:30:55,833
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, of course, you don't have the NES games hidden around, but it's still super fun.

1253
01:30:55,973 --> 01:30:56,213
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean...

1254
01:30:57,976 --> 01:31:06,982
[SPEAKER_10]: I still say though, and I said this on a previous show, but I wish they'd just develop a handful, not a lot, but a handful of very simple Flash-style games that you could unlock.

1255
01:31:07,002 --> 01:31:07,883
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be a lot of fun.

1256
01:31:08,003 --> 01:31:09,043
[SPEAKER_04]: Or maybe old Game & Watch.

1257
01:31:09,764 --> 01:31:11,945
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh yeah, that would be cool.

1258
01:31:12,066 --> 01:31:14,407
[SPEAKER_10]: Things that they don't sell at all in virtual consoles.

1259
01:31:14,507 --> 01:31:18,330
[SPEAKER_04]: Until then, I will have to make myself happy by being very, very pleased.

1260
01:31:18,390 --> 01:31:21,112
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, this is the other thing I was going to mention, is that there was a full-length movie.

1261
01:31:22,132 --> 01:31:27,634
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, based off it, and it actually had, as your animal characters, it had, they were all characters in the game.

1262
01:31:28,134 --> 01:31:29,474
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of them lives in my village now.

1263
01:31:29,934 --> 01:31:31,355
[SPEAKER_04]: In the U.S., she's Margie.

1264
01:31:32,075 --> 01:31:35,976
[SPEAKER_04]: In, uh, in Japan, she's Sally, the elephant, who's like one of the main, main characters.

1265
01:31:36,496 --> 01:31:41,077
[SPEAKER_04]: Lives in my village, and I found out that Actdeft has a bouquet, or Rosie in the U.S.

1266
01:31:41,177 --> 01:31:41,257
[SPEAKER_04]: one.

1267
01:31:41,898 --> 01:31:44,518
[SPEAKER_04]: So, it's sort of like, oh, that's cool.

1268
01:31:44,738 --> 01:31:46,319
[SPEAKER_04]: It's sort of like a way to be involved.

1269
01:31:47,019 --> 01:31:49,320
[SPEAKER_04]: So, anyway, um, Animal Crossing.

1270
01:31:49,800 --> 01:31:50,200
[SPEAKER_04]: Lots of fun.

1271
01:31:50,845 --> 01:31:52,426
[SPEAKER_10]: Animal Crossing Animal Crossing Animal Crossing

1272
01:32:15,662 --> 01:32:15,922
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway.

1273
01:32:16,102 --> 01:32:18,423
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, if Bobby keeps trolling me about Halo, it's never happening.

1274
01:32:19,643 --> 01:32:20,543
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, threatening now.

1275
01:32:20,603 --> 01:32:20,863
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1276
01:32:21,163 --> 01:32:21,623
[SPEAKER_04]: Not threatening.

1277
01:32:21,643 --> 01:32:22,203
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a promise.

1278
01:32:23,724 --> 01:32:24,004
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1279
01:32:24,864 --> 01:32:26,124
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to take a quick break, guys.

1280
01:32:26,164 --> 01:32:29,845
[SPEAKER_10]: When we come back, there is plenty more Orange Lounge Radio to come, including the Fugu question of the week.

1281
01:32:30,245 --> 01:32:35,346
[SPEAKER_10]: Some more updates on Wii U. And Jamie, I know, is going to be excited about this release for Steam.

1282
01:32:35,706 --> 01:32:38,086
[SPEAKER_10]: She will probably buy this yet again on Steam.

1283
01:32:38,346 --> 01:32:39,146
[SPEAKER_10]: It's got to be that good.

1284
01:32:39,666 --> 01:32:43,067
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll talk more about it when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.

1285
01:32:49,798 --> 01:32:57,463
[SPEAKER_10]: Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio, live on this Sunday evening, October the... What day is it today?

1286
01:32:57,483 --> 01:32:58,504
[SPEAKER_10]: The somethingth.

1287
01:32:58,524 --> 01:32:59,204
[SPEAKER_10]: The somethingth.

1288
01:32:59,344 --> 01:33:06,349
[SPEAKER_10]: October the 6th, how about, of 2013, where our 522nd episode is in progress.

1289
01:33:06,990 --> 01:33:14,394
[SPEAKER_10]: And looking at our chat room, we were playing kind of a variety of music during the break there, some mostly like Super Nintendo classics in there.

1290
01:33:15,035 --> 01:33:19,318
[SPEAKER_10]: Although we did have Animal Crossing music starting it off, we did have... I played something from Chrono Trigger.

1291
01:33:19,778 --> 01:33:20,359
[SPEAKER_10]: Animal Crossing for me

1292
01:33:43,328 --> 01:33:43,949
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you're welcome.

1293
01:33:44,109 --> 01:33:45,049
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it makes me happy.

1294
01:33:45,170 --> 01:33:49,473
[SPEAKER_04]: I miss the first game song so much.

1295
01:33:50,214 --> 01:33:54,898
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a really good story about Animal Crossing, and that would be the way I actually got Animal Crossing.

1296
01:33:55,838 --> 01:33:58,280
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, Loki actually bought Animal Crossing for me.

1297
01:33:59,461 --> 01:34:01,703
[SPEAKER_10]: Years ago, we were all playing DDR.

1298
01:34:01,743 --> 01:34:05,686
[SPEAKER_10]: We all used to post on these local forums for Sacramento DDR players.

1299
01:34:06,007 --> 01:34:07,488
[SPEAKER_10]: And I remember we were all pretty close.

1300
01:34:07,508 --> 01:34:10,691
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, there was only about maybe 20 of us that actually ever posted on these boards regularly.

1301
01:34:10,991 --> 01:34:12,132
[SPEAKER_10]: But we were all a pretty close group.

1302
01:34:12,732 --> 01:34:14,473
[SPEAKER_10]: This is before Facebook and any of that shit.

1303
01:34:14,513 --> 01:34:16,353
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe about the time LiveJournal was starting to boom.

1304
01:34:16,974 --> 01:34:22,195
[SPEAKER_10]: And Loki was like, what would you do if you just got a big bonus at work?

1305
01:34:22,235 --> 01:34:23,236
[SPEAKER_10]: What would you spend the money on?

1306
01:34:23,276 --> 01:34:25,197
[SPEAKER_10]: I said, I'd get a GameCube and Animal Crossing.

1307
01:34:25,217 --> 01:34:26,917
[SPEAKER_10]: And I come home from work, and what did Loki do?

1308
01:34:26,957 --> 01:34:28,538
[SPEAKER_10]: He bought me a GameCube and Animal Crossing.

1309
01:34:28,958 --> 01:34:29,378
[SPEAKER_10]: That was awesome.

1310
01:34:29,438 --> 01:34:32,139
[SPEAKER_10]: It was one of the nicest things anyone's ever done for me.

1311
01:34:32,279 --> 01:34:32,999
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we're all poor.

1312
01:34:33,359 --> 01:34:36,200
[SPEAKER_10]: As much of an asshole as you are on this show sometimes, Loki.

1313
01:34:38,141 --> 01:34:40,843
[SPEAKER_10]: Deep down in, he's a really nice guy, so there you go.

1314
01:34:41,264 --> 01:34:45,407
[SPEAKER_10]: I told a nice story about Loki on this show, but no, I really appreciated that to this day.

1315
01:34:45,447 --> 01:34:47,328
[SPEAKER_10]: That was a really awesome thing.

1316
01:34:47,789 --> 01:34:52,852
[SPEAKER_10]: So hearing the music, I came home, and that was on loop, because I guess they left it powered on.

1317
01:34:52,872 --> 01:34:54,153
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't even know how you got into the house.

1318
01:34:54,173 --> 01:34:55,875
[SPEAKER_10]: You must have contacted my roommate at the time or something.

1319
01:34:56,035 --> 01:34:56,235
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1320
01:34:56,635 --> 01:35:00,318
[SPEAKER_10]: And set that all up so that when I got home from work, it was already on the TV.

1321
01:35:00,358 --> 01:35:00,879
[SPEAKER_10]: It was really cool.

1322
01:35:01,199 --> 01:35:01,359
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1323
01:35:02,153 --> 01:35:11,998
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, well let's get back into some rapid fire Wait, I gotta ask before we get into rapid fire news Chell, you're quite the artist over there I see you, is that crocheting over there?

1324
01:35:12,018 --> 01:35:12,498
[SPEAKER_10]: What are you doing?

1325
01:35:12,878 --> 01:35:15,399
[SPEAKER_11]: I am macrame-ing a frickin' belt Nice!

1326
01:35:15,719 --> 01:35:30,326
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm working my way up to creepy owl I have got an entire box of old hemp and jute from this customer of my mom's She's got a yarn shop, but people tend to just drop off fibers with her So I'm like, score!

1327
01:35:30,506 --> 01:35:32,167
[SPEAKER_10]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1328
01:35:56,380 --> 01:35:59,443
[SPEAKER_10]: Very... Excuse me, I'm choking on a sunflower seed.

1329
01:35:59,503 --> 01:35:59,964
[SPEAKER_10]: Very nice.

1330
01:36:00,644 --> 01:36:02,747
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, good luck with all of those projects.

1331
01:36:02,787 --> 01:36:04,408
[SPEAKER_10]: And I like the belt you got going on so far.

1332
01:36:04,468 --> 01:36:06,711
[SPEAKER_10]: It looks very intricate with the way you kind of have to tie that together.

1333
01:36:07,471 --> 01:36:10,334
[SPEAKER_11]: It's my third, so it's been a steep learning curve.

1334
01:36:10,475 --> 01:36:11,035
[SPEAKER_11]: Trust me.

1335
01:36:11,095 --> 01:36:13,197
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, yeah, I can't even do this.

1336
01:36:13,277 --> 01:36:14,158
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't even sew.

1337
01:36:14,178 --> 01:36:16,561
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, I hear the 70s are making a comeback.

1338
01:36:18,343 --> 01:36:19,564
[SPEAKER_04]: It actually is looking really good.

1339
01:36:20,191 --> 01:36:20,792
[SPEAKER_10]: I like it, it's cool.

1340
01:36:21,412 --> 01:36:24,155
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, you should post a picture on the Tumblr or something, one of those places.

1341
01:36:24,695 --> 01:36:31,801
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, let's get to some rapid fire news, and quickly running down a few of the fast game stories this week.

1342
01:36:31,962 --> 01:36:32,202
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki.

1343
01:36:32,782 --> 01:36:34,624
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, so the Mighty No.

1344
01:36:34,644 --> 01:36:38,688
[SPEAKER_07]: 9 Kickstarter finally finished, and they ended up with $4 million.

1345
01:36:39,729 --> 01:36:41,931
[SPEAKER_07]: And it'll be coming out on a lot of different platforms.

1346
01:36:42,031 --> 01:36:42,291
[SPEAKER_07]: Spring 2015...

1347
01:36:44,752 --> 01:36:49,533
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's say maybe summer 2015 because we all know how these Kickstarters are.

1348
01:36:50,393 --> 01:36:55,034
[SPEAKER_07]: Xbox 360, Xbox One, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Vita, 3DS, pretty much every platform.

1349
01:36:55,134 --> 01:36:55,634
[SPEAKER_10]: Everything.

1350
01:36:55,935 --> 01:36:56,695
[SPEAKER_10]: Got funded for everything.

1351
01:36:57,115 --> 01:36:58,075
[SPEAKER_10]: I forgot to Kickstart it.

1352
01:36:58,675 --> 01:36:59,415
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh well, that's fine.

1353
01:36:59,695 --> 01:37:03,096
[SPEAKER_04]: Did I not say it would get funded for everything?

1354
01:37:03,776 --> 01:37:04,156
[SPEAKER_10]: No, you did.

1355
01:37:04,256 --> 01:37:04,836
[SPEAKER_04]: I predicted.

1356
01:37:06,397 --> 01:37:11,438
[SPEAKER_10]: I forgot they had the PayPal and that the $150,000 from the PayPal was going into the funds too.

1357
01:37:11,858 --> 01:37:12,558
[SPEAKER_10]: I forgot about that.

1358
01:37:13,098 --> 01:37:19,764
[SPEAKER_07]: They still may, like other Kickstarters, they still may take money via PayPal after everything's said and done.

1359
01:37:21,145 --> 01:37:21,465
[SPEAKER_10]: It's fine.

1360
01:37:21,485 --> 01:37:23,247
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll just wait and buy it when it comes out.

1361
01:37:23,267 --> 01:37:24,148
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's spring 2015.

1362
01:37:24,228 --> 01:37:26,229
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck, why am I buying stuff that comes out in 2015?

1363
01:37:27,430 --> 01:37:28,271
[SPEAKER_10]: I need the money now.

1364
01:37:28,671 --> 01:37:34,356
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'm not buying stuff that comes out in 2014 yet, let alone... But thanks to everybody who funded it for me so I can buy it later.

1365
01:37:36,297 --> 01:37:37,938
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1366
01:38:01,385 --> 01:38:01,706
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.

1367
01:38:01,826 --> 01:38:03,128
[SPEAKER_10]: She's already building one in her house.

1368
01:38:03,328 --> 01:38:09,177
[SPEAKER_04]: No, because I have a village to run.

1369
01:38:09,297 --> 01:38:09,798
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm the mayor.

1370
01:38:10,158 --> 01:38:12,542
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm Empress Sakura of Normandy and I don't have time for a Death Star.

1371
01:38:13,959 --> 01:38:22,361
[SPEAKER_10]: This makes me think of when they did that whole, like, what's that website where you can do the White House petitions or whatever, and somebody actually asked... Whitehouse.org, maybe?

1372
01:38:22,521 --> 01:38:23,341
[SPEAKER_04]: Or .gov?

1373
01:38:23,361 --> 01:38:27,482
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought they had, like, a spin-off site or something where you can do the petitions specifically.

1374
01:38:27,562 --> 01:38:28,502
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the .gov website.

1375
01:38:28,662 --> 01:38:30,162
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I thought it was, like, a separate website.

1376
01:38:30,362 --> 01:38:41,705
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if I'm looking forward to the inevitable Zynga version, you know, Killball Heights, you know, where they have, where you, you know, design your own...

1377
01:38:44,328 --> 01:38:52,650
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and then finally, you know, because there's a lot of movie, or games based on movies coming out, but we have another date for one.

1378
01:38:52,990 --> 01:38:56,191
[SPEAKER_07]: Warcraft, the movie, coming to theaters December 18th, 2015.

1379
01:38:56,231 --> 01:38:56,531
[SPEAKER_07]: And, yeah.

1380
01:39:02,762 --> 01:39:05,123
[SPEAKER_07]: Hell, I know Need for Speed's coming out next spring.

1381
01:39:05,923 --> 01:39:10,145
[SPEAKER_07]: I kind of want to see it just because it looks like a generic racing action movie.

1382
01:39:10,365 --> 01:39:14,107
[SPEAKER_10]: We still don't know who's in the cast for the Warcraft movie though, just a date.

1383
01:39:14,867 --> 01:39:17,288
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm thinking like, okay, that's a placeholder date.

1384
01:39:17,368 --> 01:39:24,631
[SPEAKER_10]: That's one of those Hollywood games of chess where they start to block out what movies are coming out when and get away from my movie and all that.

1385
01:39:26,171 --> 01:39:29,413
[SPEAKER_10]: So don't hold fast that this will actually go through.

1386
01:39:30,433 --> 01:39:31,814
[SPEAKER_10]: because it might get delayed to 2016.

1387
01:39:32,054 --> 01:39:33,315
[SPEAKER_10]: It might come out earlier.

1388
01:39:33,355 --> 01:39:36,357
[SPEAKER_10]: Sometimes movies come out earlier, although I doubt that because I haven't even started filming yet.

1389
01:39:38,318 --> 01:39:39,579
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I mean, I don't know.

1390
01:39:40,060 --> 01:39:43,302
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess it starts filming next year in January, but...

1391
01:39:45,040 --> 01:39:51,664
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not really excited for it because I don't know any of the lore, so it's just like, hey, Lord of the Rings again or something.

1392
01:39:51,804 --> 01:39:55,546
[SPEAKER_10]: If the movie's going to be successful, it's got to be accessible to non-Warcraft players.

1393
01:39:55,586 --> 01:39:56,927
[SPEAKER_04]: It has to be all about thrall.

1394
01:39:58,007 --> 01:39:58,368
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care.

1395
01:39:58,388 --> 01:39:59,188
[SPEAKER_04]: I want thrall the movie.

1396
01:39:59,368 --> 01:40:03,611
[SPEAKER_10]: I think they're taking it way, well, it was supposed to be Alliance-centered, but that was an early rumor.

1397
01:40:03,631 --> 01:40:05,612
[SPEAKER_04]: But Varian's a dick and no one cares.

1398
01:40:06,252 --> 01:40:07,253
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's going back.

1399
01:40:07,353 --> 01:40:09,634
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think the game is going to be based off World of Warcraft.

1400
01:40:09,674 --> 01:40:12,476
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the movie is going to be based off of World of Warcraft.

1401
01:40:12,496 --> 01:40:16,238
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the movie is going to be based off of Warcraft or like Warcraft 3 maybe.

1402
01:40:16,919 --> 01:40:21,682
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's cool because then you get What's-Her-Face who I think is awesome.

1403
01:40:21,742 --> 01:40:22,222
[SPEAKER_04]: Sylvanas.

1404
01:40:23,123 --> 01:40:23,543
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd be cool.

1405
01:40:25,441 --> 01:40:26,522
[SPEAKER_10]: Age of Ultros 2015 Independence Day 2

1406
01:40:45,018 --> 01:40:46,499
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my god, I'm so excited.

1407
01:40:46,959 --> 01:40:48,940
[SPEAKER_07]: I only care about Avengers.

1408
01:40:49,260 --> 01:40:54,942
[SPEAKER_07]: If it starts just like last Independence Day, I saw it was the 3rd, 4th, and 5th, I kind of want to do that again.

1409
01:40:55,442 --> 01:40:56,242
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope it's terrible.

1410
01:40:56,363 --> 01:40:57,303
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope it's absolutely terrible.

1411
01:40:57,323 --> 01:40:59,724
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope it is absolutely god-awful and I will be there every day.

1412
01:40:59,744 --> 01:41:02,545
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope Elizabeth Berkley is on the cast because that would be awesome.

1413
01:41:02,785 --> 01:41:03,846
[SPEAKER_04]: Randy Quaid Ghost, Slash Zombie

1414
01:41:31,563 --> 01:41:37,691
[SPEAKER_10]: The chatroom's making fun of me because apparently I had a Freudian slip and I said Age of Ultros instead of Ultron.

1415
01:41:38,552 --> 01:41:46,723
[SPEAKER_10]: You know you've been playing too much Final Fantasy when... It would make for a more interesting movie, to be honest.

1416
01:41:47,223 --> 01:41:47,884
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's true.

1417
01:41:48,245 --> 01:41:49,326
[SPEAKER_07]: Honestly, let's be real.

1418
01:41:49,386 --> 01:41:50,407
[SPEAKER_07]: It would be a better movie.

1419
01:41:50,807 --> 01:41:57,735
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I'm pissed because, no, actually, in the Marvel comics right now, they're pushing an Age of Ultron right now.

1420
01:41:58,316 --> 01:42:01,540
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that's the only reason why the next movie is going to be Ultron.

1421
01:42:02,501 --> 01:42:04,283
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it was fully set up for Thanos.

1422
01:42:04,303 --> 01:42:04,643
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello.

1423
01:42:04,924 --> 01:42:05,544
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I know, right?

1424
01:42:06,445 --> 01:42:07,346
[SPEAKER_10]: They just want to make you wait until 3.

1425
01:42:08,348 --> 01:42:29,686
[SPEAKER_11]: I just thought of a tagline since we're bringing Elizabeth Berkley into the cast as she should be Independence Independence Day Everybody got independence and shit That is so obscure There's like maybe 5% of the audience if that is going to get that reference But I love you just a little bit more for making it Rob What?

1426
01:42:29,987 --> 01:42:31,468
[SPEAKER_04]: Darling, you are independent

1427
01:42:35,396 --> 01:42:39,260
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know what you're doing in that jet, but it sure as hell ain't fighting aliens.

1428
01:42:41,882 --> 01:42:43,183
[SPEAKER_10]: No one understands.

1429
01:42:43,864 --> 01:42:44,524
[SPEAKER_10]: No one understands.

1430
01:42:44,584 --> 01:42:47,447
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the people who do understand will make up for the ones that don't.

1431
01:42:47,547 --> 01:42:49,409
[SPEAKER_10]: Other movies coming out in 2015.

1432
01:42:49,509 --> 01:42:50,149
[SPEAKER_10]: Star Wars.

1433
01:42:50,970 --> 01:42:51,651
[SPEAKER_10]: Star Wars Episode 7.

1434
01:42:51,711 --> 01:42:52,692
[SPEAKER_10]: Star Wars.

1435
01:42:52,792 --> 01:42:53,132
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1436
01:42:53,172 --> 01:42:53,232
[SPEAKER_10]: Who?

1437
01:42:56,868 --> 01:43:18,617
[SPEAKER_04]: flop movie in space no I'm kidding actually if the rumors are true that Daniel Day-Lewis is gonna be in it like that guy can like he could act the phone book and it would be amazing did you see the mock-up poster that some I think it was like a photoshopping job but it was really cool that had like the original actors and everything you know looking their age and all that as the characters would have been later on that's pretty cool

1438
01:43:19,197 --> 01:43:21,479
[SPEAKER_10]: I do want drunk Carrie Fisher in the movie so bad.

1439
01:43:21,499 --> 01:43:24,861
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be awesome.

1440
01:43:25,101 --> 01:43:25,682
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, man.

1441
01:43:25,842 --> 01:43:26,102
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1442
01:43:26,302 --> 01:43:27,163
[SPEAKER_10]: And also in 2015.

1443
01:43:27,563 --> 01:43:29,104
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, I know this is rapid fire news.

1444
01:43:29,124 --> 01:43:29,925
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm using my quotey fingers.

1445
01:43:30,345 --> 01:43:34,428
[SPEAKER_10]: Also in 2015, let's not forget, Batfleck is in 2015.

1446
01:43:35,769 --> 01:43:37,130
[SPEAKER_10]: And you know what?

1447
01:43:37,150 --> 01:43:37,950
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's the thing, though.

1448
01:43:37,990 --> 01:43:38,491
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's the thing.

1449
01:43:38,511 --> 01:43:38,531
[SPEAKER_10]: I...

1450
01:43:40,612 --> 01:43:43,273
[SPEAKER_10]: I love Batman stuff.

1451
01:43:43,733 --> 01:43:48,154
[SPEAKER_10]: And my favorite Batman, honestly, is the Adam West era Batman.

1452
01:43:50,455 --> 01:43:52,135
[SPEAKER_10]: Can it really get any cheesier than that?

1453
01:43:52,315 --> 01:43:52,895
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

1454
01:43:53,255 --> 01:43:54,496
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but did you see Daredevil?

1455
01:43:54,956 --> 01:43:55,856
[SPEAKER_10]: That was bad.

1456
01:43:56,216 --> 01:43:58,277
[SPEAKER_10]: Can it really be worse than Batman and Robin?

1457
01:43:58,677 --> 01:44:00,117
[SPEAKER_10]: Can it really get any worse?

1458
01:44:00,137 --> 01:44:02,978
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a good, good question because that movie was bad.

1459
01:44:03,458 --> 01:44:07,479
[SPEAKER_04]: You know the only reason I saw it was because someone else paid for it and drug me along to see it.

1460
01:44:07,853 --> 01:44:08,473
[SPEAKER_10]: Must be nice.

1461
01:44:09,154 --> 01:44:12,855
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I wasn't going to spend any money on that and that's still two hours of my life I can't get back.

1462
01:44:12,935 --> 01:44:20,479
[SPEAKER_07]: I wanted to see it because there is no way that Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr. Freeze is not going to be entertaining.

1463
01:44:22,339 --> 01:44:23,620
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody choose!

1464
01:44:23,660 --> 01:44:25,861
[SPEAKER_07]: There is no way that's not going to be entertaining.

1465
01:44:26,922 --> 01:44:38,133
[SPEAKER_11]: as a lifelong Batman fan I'm kind of resigned to the fact that he kind of goes in cycles you've got the goofy Adam Westing kind of thing then you got the ultra super serious reboot and then you got you know it bleeds into the Adam Westing again

1466
01:44:40,120 --> 01:45:02,767
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll give it a chance because everybody hated the idea of Michael Keaton as well and he turned out to be awesome but here's the thing the original Batman was also a Tim Burton movie and then you know who was the guy that did the next trilogy why am I his name is slipping my mind right now fuck him the next guy those those movies were terrible the guy who just did these recent three oh my god bad fan

1467
01:45:04,217 --> 01:45:11,822
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I'll put it... But he proved himself, and when he cast Heath Ledger, I know a lot of people were skeptical, but I was like, no, Batman Begins was the shit.

1468
01:45:12,022 --> 01:45:12,803
[SPEAKER_10]: Christopher Nolan.

1469
01:45:12,823 --> 01:45:13,864
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Christopher Nolan.

1470
01:45:14,164 --> 01:45:15,765
[SPEAKER_10]: Batman Begins was the shit.

1471
01:45:16,005 --> 01:45:17,286
[SPEAKER_10]: This guy knows what he's doing.

1472
01:45:17,646 --> 01:45:18,627
[SPEAKER_10]: I will trust his judgment.

1473
01:45:18,647 --> 01:45:19,347
[SPEAKER_10]: But here's the thing.

1474
01:45:19,647 --> 01:45:20,368
[SPEAKER_10]: Zack Snyder?

1475
01:45:21,729 --> 01:45:23,350
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know about you, sir.

1476
01:45:24,130 --> 01:45:29,634
[SPEAKER_04]: For the record, by the way, I am not going to see it because I am currently on a DC boycott.

1477
01:45:31,247 --> 01:45:42,397
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm serious, because of how they're treating their writers for their portrayal of women in their comics, and for the whole marriage bullshit, just so that they don't have to let Batwoman get married.

1478
01:45:42,718 --> 01:45:43,579
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that's a little weird.

1479
01:45:44,540 --> 01:45:46,301
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, their audition for a new artist.

1480
01:45:46,341 --> 01:45:49,524
[SPEAKER_11]: Here, draw Harley Quinn trying to kill herself in three panels.

1481
01:45:49,544 --> 01:45:51,126
[SPEAKER_11]: Sexy, underwear, sexy, you know?

1482
01:45:51,311 --> 01:45:52,432
[SPEAKER_10]: DC needs some new publicists

1483
01:46:09,542 --> 01:46:10,222
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, look.

1484
01:46:10,923 --> 01:46:13,104
[SPEAKER_10]: Moving on to something happy.

1485
01:46:13,464 --> 01:46:15,164
[SPEAKER_10]: Much more happier and gay.

1486
01:46:15,304 --> 01:46:15,885
[SPEAKER_10]: And I mean it.

1487
01:46:16,125 --> 01:46:16,805
[SPEAKER_10]: I like gay.

1488
01:46:16,945 --> 01:46:19,846
[SPEAKER_10]: Gamer X is returning to San Francisco.

1489
01:46:19,946 --> 01:46:20,607
[SPEAKER_10]: Gamer X2.

1490
01:46:21,447 --> 01:46:22,527
[SPEAKER_10]: Electric Boogaloo.

1491
01:46:22,687 --> 01:46:24,268
[SPEAKER_10]: No, that's just what I think it should be called.

1492
01:46:24,508 --> 01:46:25,489
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's Gamer X2.

1493
01:46:25,929 --> 01:46:29,670
[SPEAKER_10]: It is going to be happening July 11th through the 13th of 2014.

1494
01:46:30,050 --> 01:46:33,232
[SPEAKER_10]: They have moved to a venue that is three times as large.

1495
01:46:33,332 --> 01:46:33,712
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank God.

1496
01:46:33,812 --> 01:46:38,834
[SPEAKER_10]: God, Intercontinental Hotel in San Francisco, which is right next to Moscone Center, if I'm not mistaking.

1497
01:46:39,334 --> 01:46:41,475
[SPEAKER_10]: And they've already announced some of the guests for it.

1498
01:46:41,775 --> 01:46:54,759
[SPEAKER_10]: And also, Cards Against Humanity already signed up as a sponsor of the event, which, cross your fingers, your toes, hold your breath, that this means an exclusive GamerX set of cards, because that would be amazing.

1499
01:46:56,400 --> 01:46:57,901
[SPEAKER_10]: There's also some guests they've announced.

1500
01:46:58,021 --> 01:47:00,443
[SPEAKER_10]: I know that Ella McClain is coming back.

1501
01:47:01,925 --> 01:47:02,805
[SPEAKER_10]: What's Sniper's name?

1502
01:47:03,466 --> 01:47:05,327
[SPEAKER_10]: John Mowry, is that his name?

1503
01:47:05,387 --> 01:47:05,587
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry.

1504
01:47:06,348 --> 01:47:08,109
[SPEAKER_10]: He'll be back this year.

1505
01:47:08,170 --> 01:47:08,850
[SPEAKER_10]: They're coming back.

1506
01:47:09,070 --> 01:47:18,698
[SPEAKER_10]: And apparently, the couple that got engaged at GamerX1, and the video's huge, viral all over the internet, they're going to get married at GamerX2.

1507
01:47:18,798 --> 01:47:22,161
[SPEAKER_10]: And they're actually sent, like, everybody's getting little wedding invitations.

1508
01:47:22,261 --> 01:47:23,662
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to go and throw flowers.

1509
01:47:24,162 --> 01:47:24,482
[SPEAKER_10]: Right?

1510
01:47:24,583 --> 01:47:25,103
[SPEAKER_10]: Who doesn't?

1511
01:47:25,443 --> 01:47:26,304
[SPEAKER_10]: So this is going to be fun.

1512
01:47:26,344 --> 01:47:32,869
[SPEAKER_10]: And all I have to say, and I want to give a shout out right now to my folks in the gay podcasting circle.

1513
01:47:32,969 --> 01:47:34,590
[SPEAKER_10]: We got Game Bar.

1514
01:47:34,670 --> 01:47:37,332
[SPEAKER_10]: We got GameBooey.org.

1515
01:47:37,372 --> 01:47:38,713
[SPEAKER_10]: We got Koopa Club.

1516
01:47:39,094 --> 01:47:43,417
[SPEAKER_10]: We got Video Game Realness and so much more out there.

1517
01:47:44,197 --> 01:48:12,281
[SPEAKER_10]: I know there's plans to do something podcast cross zone 2 but like bigger, better and it's going to have to be with all these extra people that now want to be a part of it which is a great thing I mean what a horrible situation to be in it's too popular of an event I want to go you can get your tickets now but if you can't get them right now because of financial whatever they'll be on sale until they're not we need to do a panel it'll be fun, I think we should let's do a panel

1518
01:48:12,762 --> 01:48:13,202
[SPEAKER_10]: It'll be fun.

1519
01:48:13,963 --> 01:48:14,663
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, we'll talk.

1520
01:48:14,803 --> 01:48:15,504
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll get to talking.

1521
01:48:16,144 --> 01:48:18,626
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyhow, GamerX.com if you want more information on that.

1522
01:48:19,026 --> 01:48:21,908
[SPEAKER_10]: Information on Rocksmith 2014 edition.

1523
01:48:22,048 --> 01:48:25,110
[SPEAKER_10]: Adding some more songs to kind of round out their song list.

1524
01:48:25,770 --> 01:48:37,017
[SPEAKER_10]: Rocksmith 2014 edition will include Deaf Leopards, Pour Some Sugar On Me, Queen's We Are The Champions, and Mary Jane's Last Dance from Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers.

1525
01:48:37,357 --> 01:48:38,498
[SPEAKER_10]: Ooh, and a song for Bobby.

1526
01:48:38,638 --> 01:48:41,400
[SPEAKER_10]: Rush is going to be in the game with The Spirit of Radio.

1527
01:48:41,980 --> 01:49:08,523
[SPEAKER_10]: I love Rush Rush is Canada's best export I still love Alanis Morissette that's the 90s kid in me but anyway some disagree with me but deal with it there's lots of great songs in the game I'm not going to read the entire song list but remember that Rocksmith is like the no really stop hitting plastic buttons and learn how to play an actual guitar so you know if you want to go to guitar school Rocksmith 2014 is the way to do it also there's what's called colorblind mode which I think is pretty cool

1528
01:49:09,743 --> 01:49:11,624
[SPEAKER_10]: One of the producers is actually colorblind.

1529
01:49:12,144 --> 01:49:19,027
[SPEAKER_10]: And you can actually adjust the hues and the color saturation levels throughout the entire game to be a little better for the colorblind.

1530
01:49:19,347 --> 01:49:22,088
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I guess the first game got a little flack for it.

1531
01:49:22,228 --> 01:49:24,589
[SPEAKER_10]: So they are going to make it a little better this time around.

1532
01:49:24,629 --> 01:49:26,049
[SPEAKER_10]: So kudos for accessibility.

1533
01:49:26,710 --> 01:49:31,411
[SPEAKER_10]: And lastly, coming to an arcade near you.

1534
01:49:31,891 --> 01:49:33,392
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, an arcade near you.

1535
01:49:33,968 --> 01:49:43,471
[SPEAKER_10]: Plants vs. Zombies The Last Stand I'm assuming they turned Plants vs. Zombies into a ticket spitter because that's all arcade games are anymore.

1536
01:49:44,132 --> 01:49:47,153
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it is a video redemption product.

1537
01:49:47,193 --> 01:49:48,133
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, yes, of course.

1538
01:49:49,213 --> 01:49:50,594
[SPEAKER_10]: There's already a bejeweled one.

1539
01:49:50,894 --> 01:49:51,454
[SPEAKER_10]: That surprised me.

1540
01:49:51,474 --> 01:49:53,115
[SPEAKER_10]: I've never seen one of those, but I guess that is out there.

1541
01:49:53,135 --> 01:49:58,137
[SPEAKER_10]: But yes, look for more information on Plants vs. Zombies coming to an arcade near you soon.

1542
01:49:58,857 --> 01:49:59,277
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura.

1543
01:50:00,382 --> 01:50:03,943
[SPEAKER_04]: We're actually having a small discussion in chat, by the way.

1544
01:50:04,623 --> 01:50:06,824
[SPEAKER_04]: There needs to be the Jessica Jones TV show.

1545
01:50:07,164 --> 01:50:07,844
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to cry.

1546
01:50:08,964 --> 01:50:10,025
[SPEAKER_10]: Have you been watching S.H.I.E.L.D.

1547
01:50:10,065 --> 01:50:10,305
[SPEAKER_10]: at all?

1548
01:50:10,565 --> 01:50:11,785
[SPEAKER_04]: No, and I need to.

1549
01:50:12,425 --> 01:50:13,286
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to, too.

1550
01:50:13,306 --> 01:50:16,446
[SPEAKER_04]: But Jessica Jones is my favorite Marvel character ever.

1551
01:50:17,047 --> 01:50:20,568
[SPEAKER_04]: And if none of you have read Alias, which had nothing to do with the TV show, read it.

1552
01:50:20,828 --> 01:50:21,648
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, if S.H.I.E.L.D.

1553
01:50:21,688 --> 01:50:28,770
[SPEAKER_10]: goes anything like another ABC show once upon a time, they will roll out those characters just to make you watch.

1554
01:50:29,246 --> 01:50:30,468
[SPEAKER_07]: Now they have their spin-off series.

1555
01:50:30,488 --> 01:50:31,289
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, they have the spin-off.

1556
01:50:31,309 --> 01:50:32,931
[SPEAKER_10]: They just released a picture of Jafar.

1557
01:50:33,031 --> 01:50:34,854
[SPEAKER_10]: Apparently, for some reason, he's in Wonderland.

1558
01:50:34,894 --> 01:50:39,340
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not even going to try and figure that one out, but it's just like, you know, who can we roll out next?

1559
01:50:40,121 --> 01:50:41,163
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, Chell, what did you want to say?

1560
01:50:42,631 --> 01:50:43,912
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, the character thing.

1561
01:50:44,032 --> 01:50:54,158
[SPEAKER_11]: I was, you know, I started watching Once Upon a Time as kind of my trashy show and then I got emotionally involved and then it jumped the shark like, whoa.

1562
01:50:54,378 --> 01:50:58,201
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm just, I'm basically watching it out of train wreck syndrome.

1563
01:50:58,241 --> 01:51:02,544
[SPEAKER_11]: So yeah, I hadn't heard about Jafar, but now I need to check out the freaking Alice in Wonderland.

1564
01:51:02,664 --> 01:51:04,205
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, here's the thing.

1565
01:51:04,685 --> 01:51:10,889
[SPEAKER_10]: Even, I'm not really watching Once Upon a Time, but it is like next on my list once I finish off Scandal, which is far more important.

1566
01:51:11,349 --> 01:51:15,411
[SPEAKER_10]: But even I've seen the pictures of Captain Hook.

1567
01:51:16,052 --> 01:51:17,533
[SPEAKER_10]: And that is... Oh, yeah.

1568
01:51:17,633 --> 01:51:18,513
[SPEAKER_10]: That's, yeah.

1569
01:51:18,553 --> 01:51:23,096
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I said, you know, not even Robert Carlyle can get me back for the third series.

1570
01:51:23,156 --> 01:51:23,816
[SPEAKER_11]: They got me back.

1571
01:51:26,638 --> 01:51:27,499
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, moving on.

1572
01:51:27,519 --> 01:51:34,503
[SPEAKER_04]: For my rapid fire news, there's... I am getting so sick of these websites that are not iPad compatible.

1573
01:51:34,723 --> 01:51:35,183
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh-ohs.

1574
01:51:36,044 --> 01:51:36,444
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck them.

1575
01:51:37,548 --> 01:51:46,410
[SPEAKER_04]: This actually is called the Not On Steam Sale, which I'm trying to give you guys some advertising, but your site's not working on my iPad, so why should I?

1576
01:51:47,330 --> 01:51:50,850
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, it's about 66 games that are not on Steam.

1577
01:51:50,950 --> 01:52:06,313
[SPEAKER_04]: They're all by indie developers that are for sale at notonsteam.com Supermarkdown, there's some really cool stuff like Girls Like Robots, Photonica, Uzi Earth Adventure, One Finger Death Punch, which actually I think is now on Steam.

1578
01:52:06,573 --> 01:52:07,474
[SPEAKER_10]: What's Pushcat?

1579
01:52:09,335 --> 01:52:10,316
[SPEAKER_04]: That one I haven't checked out.

1580
01:52:10,796 --> 01:52:12,077
[SPEAKER_04]: There's one called Rose in Time.

1581
01:52:12,097 --> 01:52:14,359
[SPEAKER_04]: There's scanning a truck driving simulator.

1582
01:52:14,840 --> 01:52:16,881
[SPEAKER_04]: Six Sided Sanctuary looked like a fun one.

1583
01:52:16,921 --> 01:52:17,982
[SPEAKER_04]: I almost bought that one.

1584
01:52:18,422 --> 01:52:21,585
[SPEAKER_04]: The Sea Will Claim Everything, Tiny Barbarian DX.

1585
01:52:22,145 --> 01:52:23,446
[SPEAKER_04]: Lots of really neat games on there.

1586
01:52:23,527 --> 01:52:24,808
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's also Alphas.

1587
01:52:24,908 --> 01:52:26,209
[SPEAKER_04]: There's another game on here, by the way.

1588
01:52:26,669 --> 01:52:27,950
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called We'll Fight for Food.

1589
01:52:28,991 --> 01:52:29,331
[SPEAKER_10]: Nice.

1590
01:52:29,812 --> 01:52:31,453
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, this one called Spud's Quest looks cute.

1591
01:52:32,062 --> 01:52:34,085
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there's just a lot of neat looking games on there.

1592
01:52:34,245 --> 01:52:34,466
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

1593
01:52:35,447 --> 01:52:36,950
[SPEAKER_04]: And in a not so indie game.

1594
01:52:38,552 --> 01:52:39,754
[SPEAKER_04]: We all like Borderlands, don't we?

1595
01:52:41,053 --> 01:52:50,140
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, 2K and Gearbox have $100,000 worth of prizes for an in-game loot hunt for Borderlands 2.

1596
01:52:50,240 --> 01:53:01,789
[SPEAKER_04]: So basically on October 11th at 10 Eastern Time, the game will be altered so that these weird guns are going to start dropping in odd places.

1597
01:53:02,450 --> 01:53:06,433
[SPEAKER_04]: So the Knuckle Dragger will drop on Gwen's head.

1598
01:53:07,974 --> 01:53:08,495
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, no, sorry.

1599
01:53:08,515 --> 01:53:10,116
[SPEAKER_04]: The Knucklejagger will drop Gwen's head.

1600
01:53:10,176 --> 01:53:10,857
[SPEAKER_04]: My apologies.

1601
01:53:11,857 --> 01:53:16,681
[SPEAKER_04]: So, basically, you fulfill their little requirements and you could win a prize.

1602
01:53:17,582 --> 01:53:19,884
[SPEAKER_04]: I will not tell you any more about it because you need to go check it out yourself.

1603
01:53:20,964 --> 01:53:35,015
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, last but not least, there is a new Sonic game in development for Xbox One and PS4 and Wii U. And I believe it's just a working title, Sonic Thunderstorm or Sonic Blue Thunder.

1604
01:53:36,118 --> 01:53:39,239
[SPEAKER_04]: uh... there is uh... a uh...

1605
01:53:41,016 --> 01:53:54,823
[SPEAKER_04]: Looks like there's going to be a new character named Static the Hedgehog and a teenage clone of Sonic, Knuckles, Rogue, Eggman will also have teenage clones and Knuckles' clone will be called Slash the Echidna.

1606
01:53:55,103 --> 01:53:56,564
[SPEAKER_10]: Hooray, more shitty friends.

1607
01:53:56,744 --> 01:53:59,105
[SPEAKER_07]: Static the Hedgehog, he doesn't move very much.

1608
01:53:59,385 --> 01:54:01,126
[SPEAKER_07]: He's very placement.

1609
01:54:01,406 --> 01:54:02,627
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a pretty clingy friend.

1610
01:54:02,647 --> 01:54:06,949
[SPEAKER_04]: You can also play as Tails, Amy, Debra, all these other characters.

1611
01:54:07,709 --> 01:54:10,491
[SPEAKER_04]: And you also have Team Chaotix, which is all that I care about.

1612
01:54:11,531 --> 01:54:16,554
[SPEAKER_04]: 29 levels, different objects, return of old animals and chaos drives, and the Chao Garden.

1613
01:54:17,534 --> 01:54:21,576
[SPEAKER_04]: Gameplay will change characters like in Sonic Heroes.

1614
01:54:21,916 --> 01:54:22,896
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a bunch of stuff.

1615
01:54:22,936 --> 01:54:23,917
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if it's going to be any good.

1616
01:54:24,317 --> 01:54:26,178
[SPEAKER_04]: But there is the return of the Chaos Emeralds.

1617
01:54:27,338 --> 01:54:30,940
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, but what mode allows me to make them act out my fan fictions?

1618
01:54:32,839 --> 01:54:33,179
[SPEAKER_10]: None.

1619
01:54:33,539 --> 01:54:34,080
[SPEAKER_10]: Sit down.

1620
01:54:34,600 --> 01:54:43,945
[SPEAKER_04]: They're also saying that Wi-Fi will transfer Chao data and you have a Chao garden for it will be DLC and available on PS Vita and 3DS.

1621
01:54:46,343 --> 01:54:47,684
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yay.

1622
01:54:47,844 --> 01:54:49,224
[SPEAKER_04]: It better not suck.

1623
01:54:49,264 --> 01:54:49,944
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, let's be real.

1624
01:54:49,984 --> 01:54:51,725
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's hope this is a good Sonic game.

1625
01:54:51,925 --> 01:54:52,265
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, right?

1626
01:54:52,285 --> 01:54:54,946
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't they kind of alternate back and forth like Star Trek movies?

1627
01:54:55,126 --> 01:54:55,586
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1628
01:54:56,027 --> 01:55:00,868
[SPEAKER_04]: Except that doesn't apply to the Star Trek re-releases.

1629
01:55:01,689 --> 01:55:03,309
[SPEAKER_04]: The revamps.

1630
01:55:04,029 --> 01:55:05,030
[SPEAKER_04]: Because both of them have been good.

1631
01:55:05,950 --> 01:55:08,491
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the first one was way better than the second one, but that's just me.

1632
01:55:08,771 --> 01:55:09,211
[SPEAKER_10]: That's just me.

1633
01:55:09,231 --> 01:55:09,571
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1634
01:55:10,292 --> 01:55:10,932
[SPEAKER_10]: Womp womp.

1635
01:55:11,437 --> 01:55:16,761
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, let's get to the Fugle Question of the Week.

1636
01:55:17,341 --> 01:55:22,785
[SPEAKER_10]: And every week we ask our listeners a question on Facebook and Google+.

1637
01:55:23,926 --> 01:55:26,648
[SPEAKER_10]: You put that together and you get Fugle, the Fugle Question of the Week.

1638
01:55:26,728 --> 01:55:30,211
[SPEAKER_10]: And this week, as I promised, it's going to be all about Pokemon.

1639
01:55:30,271 --> 01:55:34,694
[SPEAKER_10]: So we asked our listeners the most important question possibly of the millennium.

1640
01:55:36,059 --> 01:55:39,601
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you Team Fennekin, Chespin, or Froakie?

1641
01:55:40,121 --> 01:55:47,284
[SPEAKER_10]: And for those that don't know, Loki, those are the starter Pokemon in the new X and Y. They're like Bulbasaur.

1642
01:55:47,304 --> 01:55:48,584
[SPEAKER_02]: What about option 14?

1643
01:55:48,624 --> 01:55:49,345
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't give a fuck.

1644
01:55:49,705 --> 01:55:50,125
[SPEAKER_10]: Sit down.

1645
01:55:50,145 --> 01:55:50,465
[SPEAKER_10]: Shut up.

1646
01:55:50,805 --> 01:55:53,306
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, actually, I did ask as part of the question.

1647
01:55:53,667 --> 01:55:56,508
[SPEAKER_10]: Pokemon Mania looks to be starting all over again in just a week.

1648
01:55:56,648 --> 01:55:57,948
[SPEAKER_10]: What do you think of Pokemon?

1649
01:55:58,048 --> 01:55:59,389
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you picking up X and Y?

1650
01:55:59,889 --> 01:56:03,631
[SPEAKER_10]: Or are you shocked at the number of grown adults who obsess over Pokemon?

1651
01:56:04,171 --> 01:56:24,726
[SPEAKER_10]: So let's go to Google Plus first, where Actdeft says Team Fennekin, and then he gives us a link to a community on LiveJournal called Pokemon Collectors, talking about his second question, and I see that there's two 3DSs, stuffed animals, yeah, Actdeft might have a problem, but that's okay.

1652
01:56:25,444 --> 01:56:26,184
[SPEAKER_10]: We still like you.

1653
01:56:26,685 --> 01:56:34,848
[SPEAKER_10]: He says, seriously though, I've been a Pokemon fan since the red, blue, yellow days, and I don't see leaving the Pokemon games and fan amenities time soon.

1654
01:56:34,888 --> 01:56:43,832
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm so hyped for X and Y. Jim, or excuse me, Flaco Jones says, despite my love of RPGs, I never got into Pokemon in the first place.

1655
01:56:44,332 --> 01:56:48,394
[SPEAKER_10]: Now when they come out with a game, it seems like they just expand on old stuff to make the fans happy.

1656
01:56:48,774 --> 01:56:54,937
[SPEAKER_10]: A new Pokemon release has never said to me, hey, you've never played this before, but this version will really pull you into the series.

1657
01:56:55,497 --> 01:57:10,188
[SPEAKER_10]: to be fair I think they're trying to do that with X and Y a little bit one thing I noticed about the three starter Pokemon is that their final forms kind of fall into the fighter, mage, thief kind of generalisms you expect in RPGs I found that interesting

1658
01:57:11,168 --> 01:57:40,565
[SPEAKER_10]: uh Evel uh which might be pronounced that way or E3VL I'm not sure but uh Evel responds and says I'm only purchasing one version of the game this time around why seeing the diverse age groups who enjoy the franchise I hope the creators make the plot more complex or adult oriented so that varying age demographics may have a more meaningful discussion while playing the game together well yeah but it's Pokemon I mean how deep is it gonna get just saying just saying my my personal opinion all right going over to Facebook for some answers um

1659
01:57:42,506 --> 01:58:00,651
[SPEAKER_10]: Sial says I'm looking to team Froakie closely followed by team Fennekin and I'm picking up Y as soon as I can get into the evil G to get it as for what I think of the Pokemon series Yellow was the first game that I actually owned so they hold a place in my heart and gaming library which reminds me I need to make an attempt at figuring out what is wrong with my copy of Yellow

1660
01:58:01,551 --> 01:58:09,300
[SPEAKER_10]: Shane replied, and Shane is Team Chespin, and I've been counting down the days since January, which is when they announced the games, but had no release dates.

1661
01:58:09,941 --> 01:58:11,743
[SPEAKER_10]: This is the most important release this year.

1662
01:58:12,083 --> 01:58:13,084
[SPEAKER_10]: It is already my game of 2013.

1663
01:58:14,566 --> 01:58:17,369
[SPEAKER_10]: You sound like Loki talking about a different game just a few weeks ago.

1664
01:58:18,390 --> 01:58:26,033
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, JV Mon replies and says, Team Froakie, I've never chosen a non-water starter ever since I chose Squirtle and Pokemon Blue.

1665
01:58:26,473 --> 01:58:31,414
[SPEAKER_10]: Now my only decision is between X and Y. Lucky I have both reserved so I can decide on release day.

1666
01:58:31,814 --> 01:58:33,875
[SPEAKER_10]: Pokemon will always be a go-to game for me.

1667
01:58:33,955 --> 01:58:36,096
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure, the structure's predictable, but that's part of the charm.

1668
01:58:36,936 --> 01:58:54,377
[SPEAKER_10]: for the Fallen Dreams says Team Fennekin motherfuckers I'm 22 and Pokemon will never get old to me it's hands down the best handheld RPG in my opinion it's the sole reason I'm getting a 3DS minus a few other titles it's a breath of fresh air from the constant gore and violence from more adult oriented video games

1669
01:58:54,958 --> 01:59:15,824
[SPEAKER_10]: Clover N says my wife and I have pre-ordered an X and a Y I always choose water type and my wife always chooses grass type and uh let's see uh going to the next answer Burr says Fennekin all the way I'll see if I can pick it up I haven't actually finished a Pokemon game yet though I got the furthest in blue when I when I first flirted with it during my freshman year of college

1670
01:59:17,672 --> 01:59:19,955
[SPEAKER_10]: Tim Tripp replied and said, gonna have to go with Chespin.

1671
01:59:20,396 --> 01:59:24,361
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't obsess over Pokemon, but there is a lot about it that is surprisingly compelling.

1672
01:59:24,721 --> 01:59:28,526
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't play every generation because the changes have always been a bit too incremental.

1673
01:59:28,886 --> 01:59:34,614
[SPEAKER_10]: From the looks of it, XY has made some significant forward steps without changing the core of what makes Pokemon fun.

1674
01:59:34,774 --> 01:59:35,855
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'll be picking up a copy.

1675
01:59:36,636 --> 01:59:40,259
[SPEAKER_10]: Matt J says, I've yet to decide on my starter, so can't commit to a team yet.

1676
01:59:40,819 --> 01:59:43,281
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not surprised at all that so many adults are into Pokemon.

1677
01:59:43,301 --> 01:59:44,922
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm nearly 29 and still love it.

1678
01:59:45,242 --> 01:59:48,964
[SPEAKER_10]: However, you think folks around my age were kids when the first Pokemon games came out.

1679
01:59:49,345 --> 01:59:51,486
[SPEAKER_10]: I was only 13 when Red and Blue came out here.

1680
01:59:51,826 --> 01:59:53,467
[SPEAKER_10]: Many of us adults grew up on the series.

1681
01:59:53,848 --> 01:59:56,289
[SPEAKER_10]: It made a mark on us, a mark that sticks with us to this day.

1682
01:59:57,010 --> 01:59:59,231
[SPEAKER_10]: Geovidea says, I don't even have a 3DS yet.

1683
01:59:59,531 --> 02:00:01,052
[SPEAKER_10]: Hoping for it as a holiday gift.

1684
02:00:01,473 --> 02:00:01,973
[SPEAKER_10]: Hint, hint.

1685
02:00:03,334 --> 02:00:04,695
[SPEAKER_10]: And I always pick fire types.

1686
02:00:04,755 --> 02:00:06,116
[SPEAKER_10]: It's all about the burn.

1687
02:00:07,076 --> 02:00:09,598
[SPEAKER_10]: Andy R says, I got pretty bored with the last few games.

1688
02:00:09,638 --> 02:00:10,739
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't even finish White.

1689
02:00:11,180 --> 02:00:15,143
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm still considering buying X or Y, but it'll probably depend more on how many of my friends pick it up.

1690
02:00:15,443 --> 02:00:17,905
[SPEAKER_10]: Am I shocked at grown adults obsessing over Pokemon?

1691
02:00:18,105 --> 02:00:18,305
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

1692
02:00:18,425 --> 02:00:19,806
[SPEAKER_10]: Nostalgia is a powerful force.

1693
02:00:20,607 --> 02:00:22,669
[SPEAKER_10]: Fifth Dream says, Froakie all the way.

1694
02:00:22,769 --> 02:00:27,552
[SPEAKER_10]: I always pick water type starters, unless I'm playing a second game in a generation, then I pick a grass.

1695
02:00:28,013 --> 02:00:34,638
[SPEAKER_10]: I even bought a Team Froakie t-shirt to wear when I go pick up my copy of Pokemon X. I'm 39 years old.

1696
02:00:34,938 --> 02:00:37,481
[SPEAKER_10]: So I am one of those grown adults who love Pokemon.

1697
02:00:37,821 --> 02:00:42,767
[SPEAKER_10]: I've played it since Blue came out and have played every single generation, some twice, and the spinoffs.

1698
02:00:42,887 --> 02:00:43,928
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah, Pokemon's great.

1699
02:00:44,709 --> 02:00:47,372
[SPEAKER_10]: Ragenator says, I'm on team who gives a fuck.

1700
02:00:47,773 --> 02:00:48,493
[SPEAKER_10]: Finally an answer.

1701
02:00:48,513 --> 02:00:49,234
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I mean, we haven't...

1702
02:00:49,975 --> 02:00:58,760
[SPEAKER_10]: We haven't had anyone yet say, I don't care, but here's Ragenator to break that trend saying, I'm not getting Pokemon X and Y. I've yet to buy any Pokemon game.

1703
02:00:58,780 --> 02:00:59,701
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not going to start now.

1704
02:01:00,061 --> 02:01:06,985
[SPEAKER_10]: Pokemon is about as interesting as being repeatedly anal probed by aliens nonstop for six months, followed by swimming in raw sewage.

1705
02:01:07,065 --> 02:01:07,845
[SPEAKER_10]: You're nasty.

1706
02:01:07,926 --> 02:01:08,606
[SPEAKER_10]: You're nasty.

1707
02:01:08,806 --> 02:01:10,928
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm with Team Froakie because it rhymes with Loki.

1708
02:01:10,948 --> 02:01:11,128
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1709
02:01:11,148 --> 02:01:11,288
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1710
02:01:35,994 --> 02:01:42,057
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, I'm not at all surprised that so many adults play these games because they want to rub it in the faces of six-year-olds.

1711
02:01:42,177 --> 02:01:45,459
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, to dominate six-year... I mean, I really mean... Never mind, I give it up.

1712
02:01:46,859 --> 02:01:55,263
[SPEAKER_10]: Our pal Wicked from the Nerdgasm Network says, I've been out of the Pokemon Fold since Emerald, and given how XY looks like a pseudo-reboot, it looks like it's time to get back in.

1713
02:01:55,704 --> 02:02:02,167
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm glad that we're finally getting a game that looks like the anime, and while the Pokemon count is utterly, nutterly, butterly...

1714
02:02:03,227 --> 02:02:05,409
[SPEAKER_10]: I still think there's a lot to be had in collecting them all.

1715
02:02:05,729 --> 02:02:10,553
[SPEAKER_10]: To collect them all, I'm going for Froakie because Greninja looks sick as hell.

1716
02:02:10,873 --> 02:02:16,338
[SPEAKER_10]: Plus, I'll have a Firestarter from the Torchic special event and I can never say no to having a Bulbasaur.

1717
02:02:16,358 --> 02:02:17,759
[SPEAKER_10]: A well-rounded team, ahoy.

1718
02:02:18,600 --> 02:02:22,103
[SPEAKER_10]: Hitstun says, at the moment, I think I'm getting Pokemon X and starting with Chespin.

1719
02:02:22,623 --> 02:02:31,930
[SPEAKER_10]: Once the game's been out for a week and we know more about the popular Pokemon and how to counterpick them, I'll be ready to delete my save, start again, and work towards my ideal team from the beginning.

1720
02:02:32,751 --> 02:02:37,612
[SPEAKER_10]: I already pre-ordered Pokemon Blue 15 years ago, but I skipped Generations 3 and 5 completely.

1721
02:02:37,972 --> 02:02:43,173
[SPEAKER_10]: Building a good competitive team is a lot of work, but it's worth it when the game is new and my friends are playing it too.

1722
02:02:43,793 --> 02:02:47,674
[SPEAKER_10]: SSJ100Matt says, Pokemon came out in 1998 and I've been playing it since then.

1723
02:02:47,754 --> 02:02:51,715
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm almost 30, which means I have played Pokemon for half my life.

1724
02:02:52,235 --> 02:02:54,276
[SPEAKER_10]: I will get Pokemon Y when I finish Black 2.

1725
02:02:54,956 --> 02:02:55,236
[SPEAKER_10]: Sigh.

1726
02:02:55,996 --> 02:02:57,197
[SPEAKER_10]: and lastly, Codeman.

1727
02:02:57,858 --> 02:02:59,339
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not sure about Pokemon.

1728
02:02:59,720 --> 02:03:04,745
[SPEAKER_10]: I loved Blue and Red, but I just can't add to it the huge amount of games I will have on the table already.

1729
02:03:05,185 --> 02:03:08,448
[SPEAKER_10]: I will be picking up a 2DS, so maybe then I'll try it for now.

1730
02:03:08,708 --> 02:03:09,349
[SPEAKER_10]: Probably not.

1731
02:03:09,970 --> 02:03:12,072
[SPEAKER_10]: But I was a huge fan of the Pokemon anime.

1732
02:03:12,232 --> 02:03:13,153
[SPEAKER_10]: It was fantastic.

1733
02:03:13,653 --> 02:03:20,741
[SPEAKER_10]: So, overwhelming Pokemon fans versus non-Pokemon fans there.

1734
02:03:22,343 --> 02:03:23,144
[SPEAKER_10]: And kind of even.

1735
02:03:23,184 --> 02:03:25,867
[SPEAKER_10]: It sounded pretty even on who's picking up what starter.

1736
02:03:26,327 --> 02:03:31,273
[SPEAKER_04]: I will say this, that for all the past ones that I have played, I've always started with a Fire-type.

1737
02:03:31,613 --> 02:03:31,893
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1738
02:03:32,434 --> 02:03:33,035
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just been me.

1739
02:03:33,095 --> 02:03:34,577
[SPEAKER_10]: Fennekin's super cute.

1740
02:03:34,617 --> 02:03:38,561
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, and to answer the question earlier in the show, I am Team Fennekin.

1741
02:03:38,781 --> 02:03:39,342
[SPEAKER_10]: Absolutely.

1742
02:03:39,823 --> 02:03:41,404
[SPEAKER_03]: I have no idea what that is.

1743
02:03:42,105 --> 02:03:45,389
[SPEAKER_10]: He's a little Firefox, not to be confused with a popular web browser.

1744
02:03:45,449 --> 02:03:47,892
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, well, if he's a fox and on fire, maybe I have to get the game.

1745
02:03:48,970 --> 02:03:49,711
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me show you.

1746
02:03:49,731 --> 02:03:50,931
[SPEAKER_04]: Does it like fire?

1747
02:03:52,272 --> 02:03:54,173
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, that's fucking cute.

1748
02:03:54,733 --> 02:03:55,013
[SPEAKER_10]: Right?

1749
02:03:56,234 --> 02:03:56,774
[SPEAKER_10]: That's Fennekin.

1750
02:03:56,794 --> 02:03:58,155
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me show you the others just to compare.

1751
02:03:58,175 --> 02:04:02,377
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you remember when we went to that E3 and I came back with all those damn Pokemon plushies?

1752
02:04:03,097 --> 02:04:04,358
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the plus and minus.

1753
02:04:04,938 --> 02:04:06,499
[SPEAKER_10]: That's Chespin, the grass type.

1754
02:04:07,039 --> 02:04:07,900
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, he looks angry.

1755
02:04:08,818 --> 02:04:09,779
[SPEAKER_10]: and that particular picture he does.

1756
02:04:09,819 --> 02:04:10,920
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's a happy chess pin.

1757
02:04:11,140 --> 02:04:12,381
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, here's a happy chess pin.

1758
02:04:12,401 --> 02:04:12,761
[SPEAKER_10]: There you go.

1759
02:04:13,361 --> 02:04:17,544
[SPEAKER_10]: And here is Froakie.

1760
02:04:17,704 --> 02:04:18,765
[SPEAKER_10]: Looking that up right now.

1761
02:04:19,285 --> 02:04:20,106
[SPEAKER_03]: Ew, no one gives a shit.

1762
02:04:22,087 --> 02:04:22,908
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so we know.

1763
02:04:22,928 --> 02:04:26,330
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like an old, like a frog with a beard on his back.

1764
02:04:26,710 --> 02:04:29,152
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so Jamie is definitely not Team Froakie.

1765
02:04:32,180 --> 02:04:34,601
[SPEAKER_04]: I gave them to my friend, Julie, because I don't care.

1766
02:04:52,327 --> 02:04:52,547
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1767
02:04:52,567 --> 02:04:52,607
[SPEAKER_10]: So...

1768
02:05:18,812 --> 02:05:19,312
[SPEAKER_07]: Layoffs.

1769
02:05:20,173 --> 02:05:23,454
[SPEAKER_07]: God, you don't like them, but it happens.

1770
02:05:23,534 --> 02:05:25,635
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's a couple companies laying off people.

1771
02:05:25,715 --> 02:05:29,717
[SPEAKER_07]: First off, Sega of America is confirming an unspecific number of layoffs.

1772
02:05:29,797 --> 02:05:35,780
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm assuming this is tying in with the fact that they are taking on Atlus, and perhaps there's just...

1773
02:05:38,262 --> 02:05:40,443
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of those jobs kind of overlapping each other.

1774
02:05:42,124 --> 02:05:51,649
[SPEAKER_07]: So basically, as the gaming industry continues to evolve, companies must adapt and adjust in order to compete and succeed in an ever-changing environment.

1775
02:05:51,869 --> 02:06:03,756
[SPEAKER_07]: As a result, Sega of America has recently undergone a restructure that will enable the company to focus efficiently on developing new and existing content across digital platforms as well as continuing to focus on key brands for packaged goods.

1776
02:06:06,192 --> 02:06:11,417
[SPEAKER_07]: Capcom Europe will be laying off more than half of its staff.

1777
02:06:25,228 --> 02:06:39,218
[SPEAKER_07]: and this is coming from I guess MCV who understands more than they're saying more than half of the arm faces redundancy with the number of jobs set to merge so that kind of sucks

1778
02:06:40,238 --> 02:06:42,801
[SPEAKER_07]: and I guess following a restructure in the U.S.

1779
02:06:42,881 --> 02:06:52,189
[SPEAKER_07]: operation, Capcom Europe Organization is currently evaluating its structure to ensure it's in the best position to take advantage of the changing market condition the industry is facing.

1780
02:06:52,209 --> 02:07:04,000
[SPEAKER_07]: In other words, they're doing more digital stuff, I believe, because I think a lot of their... I mean, they have franchises, but there's not a ton of different franchises that they're kind of continually putting out games for.

1781
02:07:05,882 --> 02:07:08,785
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, and just to say, I want to address something, too, I see around the internet.

1782
02:07:08,805 --> 02:07:15,612
[SPEAKER_10]: For those that are saying, like, you know, good, or that'll teach Capcom, or, you know, Capcom deserved it, or whatever.

1783
02:07:16,032 --> 02:07:17,394
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, okay, stop.

1784
02:07:17,774 --> 02:07:18,155
[SPEAKER_10]: Stop.

1785
02:07:18,475 --> 02:07:18,815
[SPEAKER_10]: Stop.

1786
02:07:18,955 --> 02:07:21,198
[SPEAKER_10]: Because the people being affected by these layoffs...

1787
02:07:21,738 --> 02:07:24,219
[SPEAKER_10]: probably have nothing to do with the decisions that you don't like.

1788
02:07:24,819 --> 02:07:32,241
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, that's the way these things go, unfortunately, is that the people that are actually getting laid off are probably pretty hardworking people that are just trying to make a good game.

1789
02:07:32,662 --> 02:07:34,642
[SPEAKER_10]: And usually these types of decisions come from high up.

1790
02:07:34,662 --> 02:07:36,303
[SPEAKER_07]: It's when you see the CEOs being laid off.

1791
02:07:36,323 --> 02:07:37,443
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.

1792
02:07:37,463 --> 02:07:40,944
[SPEAKER_10]: Then you can start saying that, you know, well, maybe it's for the best or whatever.

1793
02:07:41,044 --> 02:07:44,025
[SPEAKER_10]: So, yeah, I just kind of wanted to get that out there.

1794
02:07:44,085 --> 02:07:48,187
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, don't be all like, well, should have made the new Mega Man game because that's...

1795
02:07:50,008 --> 02:07:55,175
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, while that may be true, that's like laughing at somebody's face when they're going through tragedy.

1796
02:07:55,336 --> 02:07:58,300
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you see what the new Mega Man game was going to look like?

1797
02:07:58,560 --> 02:08:01,905
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember the leaked footage that came out of the cancelled Mega Man game?

1798
02:08:02,345 --> 02:08:03,267
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1799
02:08:03,347 --> 02:08:04,889
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, the 3DS one didn't look bad at all.

1800
02:08:05,109 --> 02:08:09,313
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, well, too bad not enough people downloaded the demo.

1801
02:08:09,413 --> 02:08:10,555
[SPEAKER_07]: Or wait, they didn't release that.

1802
02:08:10,655 --> 02:08:11,215
[SPEAKER_07]: No, they didn't.

1803
02:08:12,737 --> 02:08:16,100
[SPEAKER_07]: But not enough people downloaded the demo because they never released it.

1804
02:08:16,401 --> 02:08:20,985
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but are these layoff news about the people that made that decision?

1805
02:08:21,065 --> 02:08:21,666
[SPEAKER_10]: Probably not.

1806
02:08:22,176 --> 02:08:22,716
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for watching!

1807
02:08:37,464 --> 02:08:42,329
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a story that's hopefully a little bit happier news.

1808
02:08:43,810 --> 02:08:52,217
[SPEAKER_10]: Ever since we saw Sony do this with the PlayStation 3 and the PlayStation Vita, we've wondered if Nintendo might do something similar, and that is cross-buy play.

1809
02:08:53,158 --> 02:08:57,301
[SPEAKER_10]: Which on PlayStation 3 is awesome, because who doesn't like more games for more systems for free?

1810
02:08:57,922 --> 02:09:06,168
[SPEAKER_10]: Games like Sound Shapes and Zen Pinball 2, they have the cross-play available, or if you buy it on the PlayStation 3, you get a copy for the Vita as well.

1811
02:09:06,588 --> 02:09:14,374
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it was questioned of Dan Adleman, who is a manager of business development at Nintendo, will there be something about cross-buy?

1812
02:09:14,774 --> 02:09:20,178
[SPEAKER_10]: And quote, we don't have anything new to announce on that, but I believe that the idea has been talked about.

1813
02:09:20,578 --> 02:09:49,572
[SPEAKER_07]: so if it's something we're definitely up to considering so it's something we're definitely up to considering that's not a non-committal answer I don't know what it is if there's enough demand from developers but nothing to announce for right now so that's interesting this will work in nicely when we announce our you know the brand new technology that we're putting in place to play 3DS games on the Wii U because then you'll buy your 3DS game and play it on your Wii U or on your 3DS because that's totally gonna fucking happen someday it might

1814
02:09:50,894 --> 02:09:59,052
[SPEAKER_10]: it's not a might it's an inevitability it's just gonna happen and then cross by all the things but I can see where they might make that decision leave it up to developers though

1815
02:10:01,235 --> 02:10:06,419
[SPEAKER_10]: A developer has a right to double dip what they want, even if we don't like it and don't want to support it.

1816
02:10:07,019 --> 02:10:13,063
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, a lot of time also with the 3DS and the Wii U version, it's going to be two different developers on it.

1817
02:10:13,083 --> 02:10:18,847
[SPEAKER_07]: Because you have developers that do the handheld ports of games, and then you'll have the console developers doing that.

1818
02:10:18,927 --> 02:10:22,109
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes it's the same team, but a lot of times it can be two separate teams.

1819
02:10:22,169 --> 02:10:23,290
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, it's...

1820
02:10:24,864 --> 02:10:34,144
[SPEAKER_07]: why would you want to give something away for free considering that they're probably selling plenty of 3DS games and they need to sell more Wii U games so I don't know

1821
02:10:35,152 --> 02:10:45,096
[SPEAKER_10]: Tiger Claw in chat says, what if they take cross by a step further, speaking on the Sony side now, buy the PlayStation 4 version and you get not only the Vita version, but the PS3 version too.

1822
02:10:45,816 --> 02:10:47,677
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, we don't know enough about the Gaikai thing.

1823
02:10:47,757 --> 02:10:51,318
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't sound like it's going to be there at launch and if it will do the PlayStation 3 games.

1824
02:10:52,239 --> 02:10:54,319
[SPEAKER_10]: So I don't think we can assume that yet, but I...

1825
02:10:56,440 --> 02:10:56,660
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura

1826
02:11:18,368 --> 02:11:27,627
[SPEAKER_04]: We do have some other gaming news We have a game that I'm not any good at

1827
02:11:28,584 --> 02:11:29,745
[SPEAKER_04]: My husband's pretty good at it.

1828
02:11:30,526 --> 02:11:33,748
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people are bitching about this, too, and I'll tell you why in a second.

1829
02:11:34,489 --> 02:11:43,656
[SPEAKER_04]: But Ikaruga has hit the green light, so Treasure's wonderful shooter game is going to be out for Steam.

1830
02:11:44,496 --> 02:11:51,441
[SPEAKER_04]: And apparently, though, while it's based off the Xbox 360 version, it is...

1831
02:11:54,036 --> 02:11:57,117
[SPEAKER_04]: Going to have, I think, some different patterns from what I understand.

1832
02:11:57,637 --> 02:12:01,418
[SPEAKER_04]: So basically people who had the old patterns memorized will have to learn new patterns all over again.

1833
02:12:03,419 --> 02:12:07,640
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's also a statement that came from Treasure on Twitter.

1834
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:09,060
[SPEAKER_04]: This is new challenge.

1835
02:12:09,120 --> 02:12:11,561
[SPEAKER_04]: We are trying to distribute Treasure games on Steam.

1836
02:12:11,981 --> 02:12:13,902
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe we'll get Radiant Silvergun next.

1837
02:12:14,922 --> 02:12:15,262
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows?

1838
02:12:17,763 --> 02:12:18,103
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1839
02:12:18,487 --> 02:12:20,669
[SPEAKER_10]: It seems weird they have to go through Steam Greenlight.

1840
02:12:20,729 --> 02:12:21,729
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it's Treasure.

1841
02:12:21,849 --> 02:12:23,991
[SPEAKER_10]: Why can't they just put the game on Steam?

1842
02:12:24,251 --> 02:12:26,092
[SPEAKER_10]: Why did they have to go through the Greenlight process?

1843
02:12:27,013 --> 02:12:35,638
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe I'm not being fair here or whatever, but it just seems like Treasure would be a big enough name that they kind of get to cut ahead for a game like Ikaruga.

1844
02:12:36,359 --> 02:12:41,922
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe they're also thinking we might get something like Silhouette Mirage or Troublemakers.

1845
02:12:42,143 --> 02:12:43,944
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe they want to see what kind of support they're getting, too.

1846
02:12:44,623 --> 02:12:48,607
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Greenlight actually is a really good way to gauge support because you have that whole voting system.

1847
02:12:49,568 --> 02:12:49,888
[SPEAKER_10]: True.

1848
02:12:50,148 --> 02:12:54,572
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe they don't want to put the effort if there's not going to be enough people clamoring for it.

1849
02:12:54,852 --> 02:12:56,554
[SPEAKER_04]: But Ikaruga has been popular enough.

1850
02:12:56,694 --> 02:13:01,118
[SPEAKER_04]: I would love to have an accessible home version of Radiant Silvergun.

1851
02:13:01,378 --> 02:13:02,439
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be amazing.

1852
02:13:04,215 --> 02:13:04,896
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, let's move on.

1853
02:13:05,416 --> 02:13:05,696
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1854
02:13:21,671 --> 02:13:23,853
[SPEAKER_07]: It can be used in advertising.

1855
02:13:24,293 --> 02:13:32,359
[SPEAKER_07]: For example, they're saying that SenseConnect actually recognizes expressions and engagement or can recognize people's faces.

1856
02:13:34,421 --> 02:13:40,025
[SPEAKER_07]: That they can tell who's actually watching the ad or start targeting ads towards people and stuff.

1857
02:13:40,745 --> 02:13:56,093
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, listen, just because it could be used in that, some of the new Xbox One Connect fixtures could be used in advertising since we see expressions, engagement, etc., and how that might be used to target advertising.

1858
02:13:56,814 --> 02:13:59,915
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the point that seems to draw some controversy.

1859
02:13:59,975 --> 02:14:01,756
[SPEAKER_07]: First, nobody is working on that.

1860
02:14:02,156 --> 02:14:06,859
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not aware of any activity or any active work in this space.

1861
02:14:07,199 --> 02:14:13,164
[SPEAKER_07]: Second, if something like that ever happened, you can be sure that it wouldn't happen without the user having control over it.

1862
02:14:13,585 --> 02:14:14,145
[SPEAKER_07]: Period.

1863
02:14:14,806 --> 02:14:17,048
[SPEAKER_07]: As he emphasized.

1864
02:14:20,296 --> 02:14:34,145
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but at the same time, there's also all this controversy going on with the NSA and how they're talking about people being spied on and Microsoft is the first to jump on board with supporting that kind of stuff or complying with that.

1865
02:14:34,165 --> 02:14:49,896
[SPEAKER_10]: When we first talked about the mandatory Kinect thing, when all that E3 shit blew up, I said, what a horrible time, I think we all said, what a horrible time for this to be happening with all the NSA stuff that's coming to light right now because that all also happened over the summer and it's like, this is not going to help Microsoft's case.

1866
02:14:50,736 --> 02:14:52,057
[SPEAKER_10]: to make the Kinect mandatory.

1867
02:14:52,497 --> 02:14:54,718
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I mean, that thing needs to work.

1868
02:14:54,758 --> 02:14:58,079
[SPEAKER_10]: And haven't they come out since and said, it'll be fine if you unplug your Kinect?

1869
02:14:58,260 --> 02:14:59,920
[SPEAKER_07]: They won 80 on that point, didn't they?

1870
02:15:00,260 --> 02:15:00,741
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, they did.

1871
02:15:01,101 --> 02:15:03,862
[SPEAKER_07]: And honestly, I don't see this as a huge problem.

1872
02:15:03,942 --> 02:15:12,666
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I haven't really gotten a good peek at the interface and stuff, but I'm assuming it's very similar to how the 360 is, where you have those tiny little...

1873
02:15:13,986 --> 02:15:19,869
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's be honest, there's a lot of fucking ads on the 360 dashboard that really probably don't need to be there.

1874
02:15:20,149 --> 02:15:20,870
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, come on.

1875
02:15:21,290 --> 02:15:31,615
[SPEAKER_07]: Microsoft's been collecting money for these internet services and stuff, and don't give me that, oh, sorry, we need this extra ad revenue to cloud things or something.

1876
02:15:31,695 --> 02:15:32,356
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, whatever.

1877
02:15:33,936 --> 02:15:40,980
[SPEAKER_07]: But I just don't see the point that we need to have even ad people make these interactive connect ads or something, because...

1878
02:15:41,540 --> 02:15:43,021
[SPEAKER_07]: Who the fuck is really going to play that?

1879
02:15:43,542 --> 02:15:46,644
[SPEAKER_07]: Or actually, you know, half the people don't watch those ads anyways.

1880
02:15:46,884 --> 02:15:51,507
[SPEAKER_07]: And who's going to really want to see an ad where like, oh, hey, throw the mountain, do it.

1881
02:15:51,667 --> 02:15:53,128
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, Jeff Gershman or whatever.

1882
02:15:55,090 --> 02:16:02,155
[SPEAKER_10]: So I just... Jason in chat, VXJSXV in chat says, God, get over the fucking NSA.

1883
02:16:02,635 --> 02:16:06,478
[SPEAKER_10]: Which, you know, despite all that political hubbaloo stuff,

1884
02:16:07,098 --> 02:16:12,819
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not that, honestly, it's not really that that concerns me about the mandatory Kinect, but just like, you know, the Kinect has the voice commands and everything, right?

1885
02:16:12,899 --> 02:16:22,581
[SPEAKER_10]: I just, whether legit or not, I am paranoid that that thing would capture a really unflattering picture in an inopportune moment or something.

1886
02:16:22,961 --> 02:16:27,482
[SPEAKER_10]: Or, you know, those things are going to be able to broadcast online and call people with voice commands and stuff.

1887
02:16:27,502 --> 02:16:30,303
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's like, hey, I recognize Rob has the Mountain Dew in front of him.

1888
02:16:30,323 --> 02:16:30,943
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to take a picture.

1889
02:16:31,043 --> 02:16:34,204
[SPEAKER_07]: Look, he's doing the Dew with underwear on.

1890
02:16:36,544 --> 02:16:38,906
[SPEAKER_10]: The listeners, thank you for that visual, Loki.

1891
02:16:39,847 --> 02:16:48,372
[SPEAKER_10]: But no, for real, my plan all along was just to turn the Kinect to face the wall when I'm not playing.

1892
02:16:50,194 --> 02:16:56,358
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what I do with my current Kinect, is just turn and face the TV, or turn around the other way when I'm not playing, and it's none the wiser.

1893
02:16:56,658 --> 02:16:58,179
[SPEAKER_11]: Throw a shirt on it like Poltergeist.

1894
02:16:58,359 --> 02:16:59,020
[SPEAKER_11]: Right, yes!

1895
02:16:59,460 --> 02:17:00,561
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a great answer, too.

1896
02:17:00,741 --> 02:17:03,503
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the Kinect's like, hello, are you still there?

1897
02:17:05,424 --> 02:17:06,225
[SPEAKER_07]: There you are.

1898
02:17:07,726 --> 02:17:08,566
[SPEAKER_07]: Advertisements!

1899
02:17:23,399 --> 02:17:24,680
[SPEAKER_04]: is the stick figure room box.

1900
02:17:25,281 --> 02:17:28,404
[SPEAKER_04]: These people are really skinny and made of popsicle sticks.

1901
02:17:28,624 --> 02:17:33,849
[SPEAKER_10]: Like put like Halloween full people sitting on my couch.

1902
02:17:34,630 --> 02:17:37,713
[SPEAKER_10]: So the Connect thing, somebody sitting on my couch 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

1903
02:17:38,314 --> 02:17:39,976
[SPEAKER_10]: That somebody literally died on my couch.

1904
02:17:40,216 --> 02:17:40,716
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

1905
02:17:41,657 --> 02:17:45,421
[SPEAKER_04]: You gotta put a blow up doll on your couch so that that's all it sees.

1906
02:17:45,881 --> 02:17:46,102
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

1907
02:17:47,839 --> 02:17:48,239
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura.com

1908
02:18:09,332 --> 02:18:11,873
[SPEAKER_10]: Half-Life 3 was trademarked in Europe this week.

1909
02:18:12,373 --> 02:18:13,273
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right.

1910
02:18:13,593 --> 02:18:18,955
[SPEAKER_10]: The Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market or whatever that is in the European Union.

1911
02:18:19,315 --> 02:18:20,135
[SPEAKER_10]: Forgive my ignorance.

1912
02:18:20,155 --> 02:18:22,656
[SPEAKER_10]: That's just an overseas agency.

1913
02:18:23,496 --> 02:18:27,497
[SPEAKER_10]: Trademarked Half-Life 3 this week being owned by Valve Corporation.

1914
02:18:27,797 --> 02:18:29,958
[SPEAKER_10]: The trademark covers computer game software.

1915
02:18:29,978 --> 02:18:31,518
[SPEAKER_10]: It was filed on September 29th.

1916
02:18:31,598 --> 02:18:33,079
[SPEAKER_10]: Blah, blah, blah, blah.

1917
02:18:33,239 --> 02:18:33,459
[SPEAKER_10]: But...

1918
02:18:34,119 --> 02:18:35,560
[SPEAKER_10]: It was fake, y'all.

1919
02:18:36,181 --> 02:18:38,783
[SPEAKER_10]: As sometimes happens with the trademarks.

1920
02:18:39,543 --> 02:18:40,824
[SPEAKER_10]: This was a fake.

1921
02:18:41,224 --> 02:18:43,746
[SPEAKER_10]: It was therefore removed from the trademark.

1922
02:18:43,846 --> 02:18:46,348
[SPEAKER_10]: It was actually a part of the actual website or whatever.

1923
02:18:47,549 --> 02:18:49,530
[SPEAKER_10]: The entrant disappeared completely.

1924
02:18:50,131 --> 02:18:52,613
[SPEAKER_10]: And, yeah, it's not there anymore.

1925
02:18:52,633 --> 02:18:53,714
[SPEAKER_07]: Is this what we've come down to?

1926
02:18:53,734 --> 02:18:56,315
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, has the hype train gone this far off the rails?

1927
02:18:56,335 --> 02:18:57,536
[SPEAKER_10]: Trolling with fake trademarks.

1928
02:18:57,576 --> 02:18:59,097
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, same thing happened to World of Warcraft.

1929
02:18:59,158 --> 02:19:00,839
[SPEAKER_10]: Just, you know, same thing happens over there.

1930
02:19:01,319 --> 02:19:01,459
[SPEAKER_10]: So...

1931
02:19:02,640 --> 02:19:03,101
[SPEAKER_10]: Whatever.

1932
02:19:03,821 --> 02:19:04,362
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what?

1933
02:19:04,782 --> 02:19:07,204
[SPEAKER_10]: When Valve's ready, they'll fucking say something.

1934
02:19:07,625 --> 02:19:10,968
[SPEAKER_10]: Tell them it's happening soon.

1935
02:19:15,194 --> 02:19:18,295
[SPEAKER_07]: 300 opportunities to get a really nice PC in your house.

1936
02:19:19,216 --> 02:19:19,796
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

1937
02:19:19,856 --> 02:19:20,977
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the way I'm looking at it.

1938
02:19:21,737 --> 02:19:22,397
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, we'll see.

1939
02:19:22,417 --> 02:19:24,278
[SPEAKER_07]: If it plays Half-Life 3, hey, I guess that's a bonus.

1940
02:19:24,318 --> 02:19:24,638
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, Rob.

1941
02:19:24,998 --> 02:19:25,218
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey.

1942
02:19:25,499 --> 02:19:26,939
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a thing.

1943
02:19:27,660 --> 02:19:28,100
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, it is.

1944
02:19:28,640 --> 02:19:30,061
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, let's get to the mailbag.

1945
02:19:30,141 --> 02:19:35,143
[SPEAKER_10]: Every week, you kids email us mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

1946
02:19:35,903 --> 02:19:41,386
[SPEAKER_10]: And DarkSakura dives in the email bag head first and picks out a few of her favorite emails to read for you.

1947
02:19:41,406 --> 02:19:44,507
[SPEAKER_03]: Why do you have to tell everyone to send all those emails?

1948
02:19:44,867 --> 02:19:45,427
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see you next time.

1949
02:20:03,857 --> 02:20:06,139
[SPEAKER_04]: So I am super excited about Beyond Two Souls.

1950
02:20:06,239 --> 02:20:13,726
[SPEAKER_04]: I loved Heavy Rain despite its flaws, and from what I've played in the demos so far, this game seems to have corrected a lot of the issues people complained about in that first game.

1951
02:20:14,387 --> 02:20:20,012
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to talk about playing the game via this app called Beyond Touch.

1952
02:20:20,713 --> 02:20:21,333
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds kinky.

1953
02:20:22,882 --> 02:20:23,463
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1954
02:20:44,861 --> 02:20:46,023
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think this could backfire?

1955
02:20:46,904 --> 02:20:49,648
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess it depends on which experience is the better one.

1956
02:20:50,028 --> 02:20:52,772
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I can see gamers getting upset, but don't they always?

1957
02:20:53,032 --> 02:20:55,896
[SPEAKER_04]: If the traditional controller play is inferior to the app play.

1958
02:20:56,477 --> 02:20:59,300
[SPEAKER_04]: Or is this just good business sense and would you like to see more games do this?

1959
02:20:59,441 --> 02:21:01,023
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for all the great shows, Flacco Jones.

1960
02:21:02,055 --> 02:21:02,936
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's a good idea.

1961
02:21:03,016 --> 02:21:05,239
[SPEAKER_04]: I think gamers are going to be pissed off anyway, so it doesn't matter.

1962
02:21:06,801 --> 02:21:10,165
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the point is the bottom line, making the money.

1963
02:21:10,865 --> 02:21:12,267
[SPEAKER_04]: Making the money means selling the game.

1964
02:21:12,307 --> 02:21:14,109
[SPEAKER_04]: Selling the games make it accessible to more people.

1965
02:21:15,010 --> 02:21:15,591
[SPEAKER_04]: So there you go.

1966
02:21:16,111 --> 02:21:16,652
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my thought.

1967
02:21:16,977 --> 02:21:26,520
[SPEAKER_07]: And also making these sort of apps and stuff that work with games and things are basically just a way to get people to talk about said game as we just did.

1968
02:21:26,800 --> 02:21:29,321
[SPEAKER_10]: It works very well for MMOs too.

1969
02:21:29,521 --> 02:21:33,262
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, like having the Warcraft app is a great example.

1970
02:21:33,302 --> 02:21:36,323
[SPEAKER_10]: You can actually chat to your guildmates from the Warcraft app on the phone.

1971
02:21:36,363 --> 02:21:37,824
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like you can actually still be in the game.

1972
02:21:39,064 --> 02:21:40,265
[SPEAKER_10]: while you're not playing the game.

1973
02:21:41,345 --> 02:21:43,906
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's been calls to make that enrichment even stronger.

1974
02:21:44,486 --> 02:21:46,226
[SPEAKER_10]: But even non-MMO games had it.

1975
02:21:46,266 --> 02:21:50,447
[SPEAKER_10]: Mass Effect had that little companion app that meant you didn't have to do multiplayer if you didn't want to.

1976
02:21:50,467 --> 02:21:52,008
[SPEAKER_04]: Which I still sometimes use.

1977
02:21:52,268 --> 02:21:53,848
[SPEAKER_04]: That reminds me... It's off the store, by the way.

1978
02:21:54,049 --> 02:21:54,709
[SPEAKER_04]: It's officially gone.

1979
02:21:54,969 --> 02:21:55,549
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I heard that.

1980
02:21:55,749 --> 02:22:05,912
[SPEAKER_07]: That reminds me, since Microsoft came out with this wonderful app called Smart Glass last year as part of the Xbox 360 thing, and it's something that's going to be included in the Xbox One...

1981
02:22:06,112 --> 02:22:08,873
[SPEAKER_07]: Have they even shown anything that uses that yet?

1982
02:22:09,213 --> 02:22:19,037
[SPEAKER_10]: Have they shown anything that's gonna, you know... I think they were talking about enhancements for Xbox One, but as far as the 360's concerned, I think it's a lost cause.

1983
02:22:19,057 --> 02:22:20,978
[SPEAKER_07]: I understand that, but I'm talking about the Xbox One.

1984
02:22:21,018 --> 02:22:23,119
[SPEAKER_07]: Have they even shown anything Smart Glass does?

1985
02:22:23,479 --> 02:22:27,241
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, other than mention it, like, hey, these games are gonna use Smart Glass.

1986
02:22:27,981 --> 02:22:32,582
[SPEAKER_07]: I know we've seen stuff with Watch Dogs and stuff like that, but they have their own dedicated apps for that thing.

1987
02:22:33,042 --> 02:22:36,984
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not really Smart Glass, it's kind of this other thing.

1988
02:22:38,384 --> 02:22:42,945
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I thought the Halo 4 Smart Glass thing was great until I was like, oh, it's just another app in the store?

1989
02:22:42,965 --> 02:22:44,265
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, whatever.

1990
02:22:44,305 --> 02:22:53,008
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's meant more for movies, like being a second screen experience in movies and TV, but

1991
02:22:54,168 --> 02:22:54,669
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, we'll see.

1992
02:22:54,969 --> 02:23:00,856
[SPEAKER_10]: I will admit, TV on the Wii U is kind of neat, and it's a bummer more people don't use it.

1993
02:23:01,277 --> 02:23:09,367
[SPEAKER_10]: It's kind of a neat little second screen experience where you can kind of chat with people as big shows are happening and stuff, but it would be neat if there was something like that on Xbox, but I don't know.

1994
02:23:09,467 --> 02:23:09,787
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see.

1995
02:23:09,807 --> 02:23:12,070
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, next email?

1996
02:23:12,811 --> 02:23:12,951
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1997
02:23:13,908 --> 02:23:15,749
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey OLR, it's your friendly neighborhood turtle.

1998
02:23:16,350 --> 02:23:17,951
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to share a quick funny story.

1999
02:23:18,431 --> 02:23:23,875
[SPEAKER_04]: My wife was downstairs last night cooking dinner when she heard me let out a shriek as if my soul was being ripped out.

2000
02:23:24,435 --> 02:23:28,718
[SPEAKER_04]: She ran upstairs concerned that I'd hurt myself and found me laughing at myself playing Alan Wake.

2001
02:23:29,239 --> 02:23:30,400
[SPEAKER_04]: I was pretty embarrassed.

2002
02:23:30,500 --> 02:23:31,881
[SPEAKER_04]: She had a good chuckle at that.

2003
02:23:33,062 --> 02:23:37,084
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, I'm laughing because I'm like, what does one's soul being ripped out sound like?

2004
02:23:37,385 --> 02:23:43,529
[SPEAKER_10]: But then I thought back earlier in the show to that Pokemon fighting video somebody linked us to and I'm like, oh, it probably sounded like that.

2005
02:23:44,884 --> 02:23:47,166
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, can't wait for GTA 5 to come out on PC.

2006
02:23:47,206 --> 02:23:48,206
[SPEAKER_04]: I refuse to buy it twice.

2007
02:23:49,187 --> 02:23:50,048
[SPEAKER_04]: And then this one's to me.

2008
02:23:50,188 --> 02:23:51,709
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope that this week you aren't sick.

2009
02:23:52,690 --> 02:23:53,290
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

2010
02:23:53,931 --> 02:23:54,971
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sick all the time.

2011
02:23:55,552 --> 02:23:56,352
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you feeling right now?

2012
02:23:56,393 --> 02:23:56,653
[SPEAKER_10]: You good?

2013
02:23:57,759 --> 02:23:59,220
[SPEAKER_10]: Allergies.

2014
02:24:00,381 --> 02:24:02,182
[SPEAKER_04]: Having allergies is not the same as being sick.

2015
02:24:03,403 --> 02:24:06,485
[SPEAKER_04]: And granted, I also got stung by an asshole wasp.

2016
02:24:07,426 --> 02:24:09,928
[SPEAKER_04]: Which I'm sure Rachel will attest to.

2017
02:24:10,628 --> 02:24:12,450
[SPEAKER_04]: I get pretty sick from waspies.

2018
02:24:13,530 --> 02:24:14,311
[SPEAKER_04]: It was at her house.

2019
02:24:15,592 --> 02:24:16,873
[SPEAKER_04]: And Rob, keep on being fabulous.

2020
02:24:18,774 --> 02:24:19,255
[SPEAKER_09]: Will do.

2021
02:24:20,532 --> 02:24:27,971
[SPEAKER_04]: I look forward to downloading the podcast every Monday morning so I can listen to it while working keep up the good times, your loyal turtle in Philadelphia, Serious Turtle

2022
02:24:29,800 --> 02:24:30,561
[SPEAKER_04]: Next email.

2023
02:24:51,027 --> 02:24:56,009
[SPEAKER_04]: I freeze up, get the big guys, and I am completely unable to speak.

2024
02:24:56,650 --> 02:25:01,432
[SPEAKER_04]: The only time I rode Tower of Terror, I was literally mute for the next 30 minutes.

2025
02:25:01,612 --> 02:25:02,973
[SPEAKER_04]: I could not speak.

2026
02:25:04,273 --> 02:25:07,155
[SPEAKER_10]: Note to self, get Jamie to ride Tower of Terror before OLR.

2027
02:25:07,195 --> 02:25:09,256
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not even funny, Rob.

2028
02:25:10,176 --> 02:25:10,817
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, come on.

2029
02:25:10,897 --> 02:25:11,677
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just a joke.

2030
02:25:12,020 --> 02:25:14,063
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but it's a real thing and it's horrible.

2031
02:25:15,085 --> 02:25:19,973
[SPEAKER_04]: So I will sit through a scary movie and just like eyes wide open and won't say anything.

2032
02:25:20,534 --> 02:25:22,377
[SPEAKER_04]: You know I'm scared if I haven't said shit.

2033
02:25:25,949 --> 02:25:26,769
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, OLR.

2034
02:25:26,849 --> 02:25:32,451
[SPEAKER_04]: Although PS4 certainly has a very positive vibe about it, I was very compelled to buy a PlayStation console for the first time.

2035
02:25:32,851 --> 02:25:34,512
[SPEAKER_04]: I decided to get an Xbox One anyway.

2036
02:25:35,092 --> 02:25:37,613
[SPEAKER_04]: The reason might sound strange, but it's Kinect that convinced me.

2037
02:25:37,693 --> 02:25:40,915
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the first Kinect a lot for several reasons.

2038
02:25:41,495 --> 02:25:44,436
[SPEAKER_04]: For the first time, I could play video games with everyone around me.

2039
02:25:44,496 --> 02:25:47,877
[SPEAKER_04]: My girlfriend likes it, and she's very good at it, kicking my virtual ass all the time.

2040
02:25:48,478 --> 02:25:51,799
[SPEAKER_04]: Even my dad and mom play from time to time, and they never played video games before.

2041
02:25:52,459 --> 02:25:54,440
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone likes it because it's so simple to use.

2042
02:25:54,660 --> 02:26:03,422
[SPEAKER_04]: Even more simple than Wii or PS Move since no buttons are used at all.

2043
02:26:04,102 --> 02:26:06,343
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, Kinect is a fresh wind in gaming that is needed.

2044
02:26:06,663 --> 02:26:10,864
[SPEAKER_04]: It's something completely different than just another standard first-person shooter.

2045
02:26:13,865 --> 02:26:33,376
[SPEAKER_04]: and that's why I don't get why Kinect gets all the hate because it sucks mostly from so-called hardcore gamers sure it's not perfect at all and it has to prove itself a lot more that's why Kinect 2 needs to get it right this time but I think that it's an important step forward in the general development of gaming a step of which we don't understand its importance yet

2046
02:26:34,256 --> 02:26:37,480
[SPEAKER_04]: A step as important as the joystick or am I giving it too much credit?

2047
02:26:37,660 --> 02:26:38,021
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

2048
02:26:38,922 --> 02:26:41,886
[SPEAKER_04]: What if Kinect becomes well used and mainstream?

2049
02:26:42,026 --> 02:26:42,847
[SPEAKER_04]: God, I hope not.

2050
02:26:43,347 --> 02:26:45,310
[SPEAKER_04]: What would be the next step in gaming beyond that?

2051
02:26:45,390 --> 02:26:48,233
[SPEAKER_04]: As always, I'm very thankful for you guys making a podcast every week.

2052
02:26:48,333 --> 02:26:49,134
[SPEAKER_04]: Fabrice from Belgium.

2053
02:26:50,218 --> 02:26:52,460
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, and I am super opinionated about it.

2054
02:26:52,620 --> 02:26:53,481
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't like the Kinect.

2055
02:26:53,561 --> 02:26:54,742
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have fun with the Kinect.

2056
02:26:54,822 --> 02:26:56,284
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never had fun with the Kinect.

2057
02:26:56,984 --> 02:27:08,214
[SPEAKER_04]: If I want to play something that's going to involve me using motion, I want a peripheral like my dance pads for DDR or my maracas for Samba.

2058
02:27:08,334 --> 02:27:13,359
[SPEAKER_04]: I want something that's going to be specifically related to the game that I'm playing.

2059
02:27:14,199 --> 02:27:17,602
[SPEAKER_04]: I, I hated, I don't like watching myself.

2060
02:27:18,063 --> 02:27:19,544
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean, maybe it's just a me thing.

2061
02:27:20,085 --> 02:27:28,332
[SPEAKER_04]: But even though I had a lot of fun with Dance Masters, the, to do Parapara, I could not watch the screen, if that made sense.

2062
02:27:28,873 --> 02:27:30,955
[SPEAKER_04]: I did all the stupid Parapara dances with my eyes closed.

2063
02:27:32,076 --> 02:28:01,153
[SPEAKER_10]: well you can also turn off your silhouettes in that game if you really want to but you know well here's the thing about Kinect it's like you know yeah I might razz on Kinect a little bit but like I get that it's super accessible and that like you know people who don't even play a lot of games will be like oh what's that dance game oh that looks kind of neat I can do that I can just move and play the game I can do that you know I get where like it's highly accessible but for me the thing that really bothers me about Kinect is it's like the same three punchlines over and over it's dance and fitness games it's

2064
02:28:01,633 --> 02:28:16,434
[SPEAKER_10]: or I should say it's dance games it's fitness games and you know once in a while other weird like voice integrations and things like I haven't really seen a lot of Kinect games that made me go wow this is the future of gaming a system is only as good as the games that are on it right?

2065
02:28:17,775 --> 02:28:39,371
[SPEAKER_10]: and I thought maybe like Child of Eden that was kind of neat but that was like one game you know there haven't hasn't been a lot that I feel is really pushed gaming forward which is why it really surprised me when they said and the Xbox One's gonna require it and I'm like oh my god but this joke is dying fast they need to if they're gonna use the Kinect they need to like do like Kinect plus Oculus Rift or something and maybe that would be real immersive I

2066
02:28:40,069 --> 02:28:40,990
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2067
02:29:03,106 --> 02:29:09,511
[SPEAKER_07]: I saw a thing with the Kinect and the Oculus Rift and a stationary bike for the Paperboy thing.

2068
02:29:09,531 --> 02:29:17,737
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I was going to say, I'm pretty sure those mods are out there because if you think about it, Oculus Rift, PC, Kinect, they have PC devices and things or drivers and things for that too.

2069
02:29:17,817 --> 02:29:19,518
[SPEAKER_10]: So, you know, it's out there.

2070
02:29:19,558 --> 02:29:21,740
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sure it's just probably a pain in the butt to develop for.

2071
02:29:22,780 --> 02:29:48,457
[SPEAKER_11]: Connect always reminds me of, it's in the book of Hitchhiker's Guide, because you can't really translate this into a movie, but it talks about how their society goes from push button to touch screen to connect-like thing, and it finally ends up where Zaphod Beelbrox is sitting on the bridge of Heart of Gold trying to listen to music, and you have to operate these systems, you have to sit absolutely still, because any motion towards the console whatsoever is going to trigger it.

2072
02:29:49,118 --> 02:29:51,679
[SPEAKER_11]: That, to me, seems like that's where we're going with this.

2073
02:29:53,778 --> 02:29:59,802
[SPEAKER_04]: I hear ya, I hear ya Alright, so next email God, we still have four emails Oh my god, really?

2074
02:30:00,862 --> 02:30:08,107
[SPEAKER_04]: Kiflom, O-L-R, it's Degenerate Johnny It's a GTA 5 reference, ask Loki what that means Okay Say what now?

2075
02:30:08,567 --> 02:30:19,934
[SPEAKER_07]: Kiflom Oh yeah, it's the made up Scientology Oh god It's what they say to each other Kiflom

2076
02:30:20,600 --> 02:30:47,932
[SPEAKER_04]: I couldn't help but notice the argument that that wasn't really an argument that Jamie and Loki had last week over their tastes in video games I'm often entertained by your arguments but they sometimes have a tense feel about them just an observation the beauty of interactive entertainment is that there's a variety of good games that will appeal to many but not to everyone it's for this reason why Alan doesn't play Dead Space why Bobby doesn't play Shooters why Rob doesn't play Cookie Clicker that's not true

2077
02:30:48,752 --> 02:30:52,273
[SPEAKER_04]: Personally, I don't very much care for the Elder Scrolls series.

2078
02:30:52,313 --> 02:30:54,774
[SPEAKER_04]: Melee combat in the first-person perspective doesn't work well for me.

2079
02:30:55,294 --> 02:31:03,877
[SPEAKER_04]: As an individual who appreciates both game series, I can see why one of the main problems between Mass Effect and GTA involves the relationship between stories and gameplay.

2080
02:31:04,697 --> 02:31:10,219
[SPEAKER_04]: I may be generalizing here, but Mass Effect's heavily involved story and dialogue often gets in the way of the stellar gameplay.

2081
02:31:11,019 --> 02:31:15,261
[SPEAKER_04]: I know the dialogue can be skipped, but some people just want to play the game.

2082
02:31:16,221 --> 02:31:17,783
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't think it was an argument, was it?

2083
02:31:34,895 --> 02:31:35,876
[SPEAKER_10]: Rob, I disagree with you all the time.

2084
02:31:54,594 --> 02:31:56,476
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2085
02:32:10,348 --> 02:32:11,690
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2086
02:32:36,093 --> 02:32:49,021
[SPEAKER_04]: I also want to address the misconception of the GTA series having a misogynistic atmosphere Even though GTA has often been littered with prostitutes and strippers the game series has had a variety of strong female characters dating back to GTA 3

2087
02:32:50,282 --> 02:32:51,143
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to go ahead and say this.

2088
02:32:51,343 --> 02:32:54,727
[SPEAKER_04]: Having a few strong female characters does not make up for misogyny.

2089
02:32:54,907 --> 02:32:55,348
[SPEAKER_04]: Just saying.

2090
02:32:56,770 --> 02:33:03,297
[SPEAKER_04]: The one thing about the GTA series is that it plays the role of social commentator in the world we live in today, i.e.

2091
02:33:03,377 --> 02:33:06,641
[SPEAKER_04]: life provider equals Facebook, medical cocaine equals marijuana.

2092
02:33:07,882 --> 02:33:13,487
[SPEAKER_04]: GTA 5 is no exception to this because it often has commented against our patriarchal society throughout the game.

2093
02:33:14,147 --> 02:33:20,632
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though there is yet to be a lead female character in the GTA series, GTA 5 has strong female characters throughout the story.

2094
02:33:21,113 --> 02:33:27,518
[SPEAKER_04]: One such example is female crew members that you can select for heists.

2095
02:33:27,998 --> 02:33:36,125
[SPEAKER_04]: Many of the most skilled crew recruits are women and they know it, which is why they get a higher take from jobs than the male crew recruits.

2096
02:33:36,645 --> 02:33:40,347
[SPEAKER_04]: Not to mention GTA Online offers the option for you to be a woman.

2097
02:33:40,687 --> 02:33:47,569
[SPEAKER_04]: With that being said, maybe sometime in the future we could expect Jamie to join the VOG crew to take down the patriarchal douchebags that infest the online community.

2098
02:33:47,629 --> 02:33:49,970
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm actually already working on something for that, but more later.

2099
02:33:51,231 --> 02:34:01,875
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, as an individual who has a significant appreciation for strong women in video games, the KOTOR series, Final Fantasy XII, Mirror's Edge, I just wanted to add in my two cents, Sincerely, Degenerate Johnny.

2100
02:34:02,455 --> 02:34:27,275
[SPEAKER_04]: I think what my problem more with the misogynistic presentation in the game is the fact that it is coming from real life that it's an aspect of real life that seems to be almost an ingrained part of culture that shouldn't be that we should strive to be better than

2101
02:34:28,439 --> 02:34:28,659
[SPEAKER_10]: I think

2102
02:35:01,754 --> 02:35:20,924
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's not necessarily just a matter of looking to be offended people are going to be offended as a reaction and as I've often said not necessarily on the show but in real life you can't necessarily help a reaction you can help by acting instead of acting on your reaction

2103
02:35:21,804 --> 02:35:42,103
[SPEAKER_04]: so I think that the problem being is that illustrating that yeah, this is a part of society the fact that it has to be something that's brought up in a game to be a realistic parody means that it's something that needs more attention to be combated if that makes sense yeah, it's something to think about

2104
02:35:42,856 --> 02:36:12,195
[SPEAKER_04]: and I mean and you know honestly it was a big turn off for me in trying to play the game I'll sit and watch I've sat and watched a bunch of the missions in the game while Dan played because he I could not touch the PS3 anytime Dan was home because he was always playing that game and I watched a lot of it but after a while there's just like so much you can take before you're like wow I've hit my saturation point I feel really down you know

2105
02:36:15,127 --> 02:36:36,412
[SPEAKER_04]: it's a really hard thing to put a finger on because I think I'm hearing that maybe the problem is that like okay yeah the joke is funny the first 500 times yeah but there's only so much you want to hear derogatory terms being used toward women even if it's done in a parody sense after a while it really does stop being funny Chell wants to chime in here

2106
02:36:37,136 --> 02:36:51,419
[SPEAKER_11]: I think this is, you know, if we are going along the lines of GTA as a big over-the-top parody, is it sounds like it's kind of falling prey to Dave Chappelle syndrome, where after a certain point he stopped doing the show because he realized the wrong people were laughing at his jokes.

2107
02:36:51,719 --> 02:36:57,600
[SPEAKER_11]: Because, you know, there's only so far you can go with ironic racism before it just loops around and becomes good old-fashioned racism.

2108
02:36:57,940 --> 02:37:01,041
[SPEAKER_11]: And that seems like what's happening a bit here.

2109
02:37:01,181 --> 02:37:02,141
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, the parody is getting...

2110
02:37:02,681 --> 02:37:07,642
[SPEAKER_11]: Too close to the truth and it stops being funny for some people.

2111
02:37:07,902 --> 02:37:09,703
[SPEAKER_11]: It's my two cents.

2112
02:37:10,703 --> 02:37:12,063
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually fully agree with that.

2113
02:37:12,103 --> 02:37:14,824
[SPEAKER_04]: That is on the money.

2114
02:37:15,684 --> 02:37:15,904
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

2115
02:37:15,964 --> 02:37:24,787
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, in the interest of time, I'm going to ask Jamie to go to the next email, but keep those emails coming on this topic or tweets, mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com or twitter.com slash OLR.

2116
02:37:25,467 --> 02:37:29,928
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, since Reginator just told me to skip his email, I'm skipping it.

2117
02:37:30,428 --> 02:37:30,668
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

2118
02:37:32,193 --> 02:37:33,134
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, I might go back to it.

2119
02:37:33,174 --> 02:37:34,354
[SPEAKER_10]: Roll it over for next week, I guess.

2120
02:37:35,555 --> 02:37:36,636
[SPEAKER_04]: God, this one's long, too.

2121
02:37:36,656 --> 02:37:40,379
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I mean, it's fucking really fucking long.

2122
02:37:40,839 --> 02:37:42,100
[SPEAKER_04]: It's from Raw Still UT.

2123
02:37:45,022 --> 02:37:49,505
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's really... Okay, I'm gonna go for it.

2124
02:37:49,525 --> 02:37:50,786
[SPEAKER_10]: We need a TLDR.

2125
02:37:50,806 --> 02:37:52,547
[SPEAKER_10]: Can we try to get a TLDR version of it?

2126
02:37:54,008 --> 02:37:54,848
[SPEAKER_10]: Just for time's sake.

2127
02:37:55,229 --> 02:37:56,489
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to just read the first paragraph.

2128
02:37:56,509 --> 02:37:58,370
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it has to do with what we just talked about.

2129
02:37:58,390 --> 02:37:59,130
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's my suggestion.

2130
02:37:59,190 --> 02:38:00,671
[SPEAKER_10]: You go to the next email.

2131
02:38:00,791 --> 02:38:03,312
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll skim this email and try to pick out the key points.

2132
02:38:03,832 --> 02:38:04,792
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, OLR gang.

2133
02:38:05,333 --> 02:38:10,715
[SPEAKER_04]: As I typically save the show for my commute two plus hours a day, I don't have much opportunity to call into the show.

2134
02:38:11,155 --> 02:38:14,956
[SPEAKER_04]: I noticed that the mailbag has been fairly empty lately, so I had a suggestion.

2135
02:38:14,996 --> 02:38:18,558
[SPEAKER_04]: Why not address comments from the podcast entries on the VOG Network page as well?

2136
02:38:19,438 --> 02:38:25,705
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, I'm well into my first playthrough of Mass Effect 2, just in case there wasn't a requisite mention of Mass Effect elsewhere in the show.

2137
02:38:26,446 --> 02:38:34,595
[SPEAKER_04]: I've also been playing Dragon Fantasy Book 1 on my PS Vita, which is a hilariously old-school 8-bit RPG in tradition of the early Dragon Quest games.

2138
02:38:34,715 --> 02:38:37,258
[SPEAKER_04]: Until next time, John K. Critical Myth.

2139
02:38:38,870 --> 02:38:40,292
[SPEAKER_10]: Great question from Critical Myth.

2140
02:38:40,372 --> 02:38:49,265
[SPEAKER_10]: We do try to incorporate the VOG Network comments, especially on a slower news week, but we haven't done them in a while, to be fair.

2141
02:38:49,445 --> 02:38:53,270
[SPEAKER_10]: And I might actually be confusing with Horde House, because I know we do VOG comments more often over there.

2142
02:38:53,691 --> 02:38:54,692
[SPEAKER_10]: But certainly, I mean...

2143
02:38:55,673 --> 02:39:00,178
[SPEAKER_10]: The thing about the VOG comments, I tend to just respond to them on the spot.

2144
02:39:00,558 --> 02:39:02,720
[SPEAKER_10]: Like when I see those comments, I can't wait for Sunday.

2145
02:39:03,161 --> 02:39:04,802
[SPEAKER_10]: I just have to respond on the spot.

2146
02:39:05,163 --> 02:39:08,586
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you want to get something right away, the VOG comments are the place to go.

2147
02:39:08,626 --> 02:39:14,892
[SPEAKER_10]: But if there's like a really good point or counterpoint or something brought up, it's going to come to the show one way or another.

2148
02:39:15,173 --> 02:39:18,036
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to inevitably say, yeah, somebody was posting about this on VOG.

2149
02:39:18,815 --> 02:39:24,102
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, while you're back to scanning that one, I'll read Reginator's email.

2150
02:39:24,122 --> 02:39:24,803
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, you got it.

2151
02:39:25,223 --> 02:39:25,844
[SPEAKER_04]: Since it's short.

2152
02:39:26,324 --> 02:39:30,810
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi all, this is everyone's favorite emailer, Hero2Many, and a total amazing all-around guy, Reginator.

2153
02:39:32,572 --> 02:39:33,794
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, it was on the email.

2154
02:39:34,735 --> 02:39:35,275
[SPEAKER_04]: So I said it.

2155
02:39:35,896 --> 02:39:36,497
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

2156
02:39:51,333 --> 02:39:57,455
[SPEAKER_04]: As late as August 2012, I would have scoffed at the notion of PC gaming having been a console fanboy for the better part of my life.

2157
02:39:58,076 --> 02:40:04,278
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that I've been on Steam for a while now, plus having played Diablo 2 as well, I'm quite thoroughly enjoying PC gaming.

2158
02:40:04,938 --> 02:40:10,220
[SPEAKER_04]: I also, as of late, have been questioning whether or not I really need to replace my PS3.

2159
02:40:10,780 --> 02:40:12,641
[SPEAKER_04]: That being said, I'd like to pose this question.

2160
02:40:12,741 --> 02:40:18,303
[SPEAKER_04]: Have any of you been in a situation where you enjoyed X so much that you questioned whether or not to replace Y?

2161
02:40:18,863 --> 02:40:30,436
[SPEAKER_04]: This email has been brought to you by the clearly superior Japanese soundtrack Japanese version of the Sonic CD soundtrack The US version is just lame, y'all better recognize For the record, I don't think it's lame I just think the Japanese music is better

2162
02:40:31,690 --> 02:40:31,990
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

2163
02:40:32,030 --> 02:40:34,132
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the same thing I say about Chrono Trigger and Super Metroid.

2164
02:40:34,152 --> 02:40:36,073
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm like, I'm not saying Chrono Trigger is bad.

2165
02:40:36,853 --> 02:40:37,254
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not.

2166
02:40:37,994 --> 02:40:40,076
[SPEAKER_10]: In fact, it's better than good.

2167
02:40:40,656 --> 02:40:43,478
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's just, Super Metroid is like top tier.

2168
02:40:43,498 --> 02:40:44,399
[SPEAKER_04]: It's better than bad, it's good?

2169
02:40:45,419 --> 02:40:45,659
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure.

2170
02:40:46,760 --> 02:40:50,543
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm going to say this, I've never been in that situation because, I mean, shit.

2171
02:40:51,343 --> 02:40:55,106
[SPEAKER_04]: I probably have just about every video game system that's worth owning.

2172
02:40:56,587 --> 02:40:59,228
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never been in that situation that I, you know.

2173
02:40:59,909 --> 02:41:01,390
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I've had games that

2174
02:41:02,924 --> 02:41:21,541
[SPEAKER_04]: like for example Dragon Ball GT Final Bout when I owned that game it was worth a lot of money I traded it for Blue Stinger I've never regretted it even though I can get that game any number of ways now I don't care it's not that great of a game and I'm totally not into Dragon Ball that much anymore unless I'm like watching the old school stuff

2175
02:41:23,772 --> 02:41:28,196
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, I am going to try to tackle this email from Ross Steel UT, and I'm going to shorten it.

2176
02:41:28,216 --> 02:41:35,522
[SPEAKER_10]: So I apologize to Ross Steel UT in that regard, but it is a very long letter, and we're already at 9 o'clock, and we still have to get calls and wrap the show.

2177
02:41:35,542 --> 02:41:38,044
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think it would be possible we can allow it to be reposted on the forums?

2178
02:41:38,284 --> 02:41:39,545
[SPEAKER_10]: I would want his permission for that.

2179
02:41:40,706 --> 02:41:43,149
[SPEAKER_04]: We asked him to post it on the forum.

2180
02:41:43,249 --> 02:41:44,911
[SPEAKER_10]: But let me get some of the stuff.

2181
02:41:44,951 --> 02:41:48,316
[SPEAKER_10]: Because first it starts off with a couple paragraphs about the whole Grand Theft Auto V thing.

2182
02:41:48,776 --> 02:41:55,565
[SPEAKER_10]: So he says, I thought I'd explain to Loki why the casual sexism, racism, and homotransphobia in Grand Theft Auto V is offensive to people.

2183
02:41:56,365 --> 02:41:58,687
[SPEAKER_10]: I firmly agree that not every game needs a female lead.

2184
02:41:59,287 --> 02:42:02,429
[SPEAKER_10]: There's plenty of room in the space between lead character and joke character.

2185
02:42:02,850 --> 02:42:07,333
[SPEAKER_10]: When a group that you're in is exclusively depicted in an offensive manner, that's not going to be fun.

2186
02:42:07,713 --> 02:42:12,876
[SPEAKER_10]: Vice City put that into focus for me as a Cuban-American who went to school with more than a few Haitian-American in his day.

2187
02:42:12,936 --> 02:42:16,739
[SPEAKER_10]: The gangs were simply identified by race, and all the characters were racist cardboard cutouts.

2188
02:42:17,219 --> 02:42:19,501
[SPEAKER_10]: Compare that to games based around the Clancyverse.

2189
02:42:19,541 --> 02:42:25,625
[SPEAKER_10]: The main protagonist tends to be a white dude, but women in other races are treated with respect and are never relegated to the sidelines.

2190
02:42:27,106 --> 02:42:50,835
[SPEAKER_10]: both GTA and the Clancy games are plainly aimed at the male demographic but the latter does so in a manner that respects minorities and women while the former makes jokes out of them this isn't to say Rockstar should be forbidden to do what they do I'm a big proponent of free speech however that free speech goes both ways and if Rockstar wants to continue to take the cardboard cutout approach to their characters and rely exclusively on negative stereotypes they should be ready to be called out on it

2191
02:42:51,195 --> 02:42:56,860
[SPEAKER_10]: In fact, I don't think Rockstar cares as they've been relying on cheap headline grabbing garbage to sell Grand Theft Auto for years now.

2192
02:42:57,280 --> 02:43:01,544
[SPEAKER_10]: Solving the problem might lead to less sales, so why stop degrading women and minorities?

2193
02:43:03,446 --> 02:43:08,911
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the... I'm a little bit with you, Rosteel UT, until like your last two sentences.

2194
02:43:09,471 --> 02:43:17,798
[SPEAKER_10]: And the reason for that is that I think you're also kind of dismissing why... that quite possibly there are people that are drawn to Grand Theft Auto because it's a good game.

2195
02:43:18,599 --> 02:43:19,259
[SPEAKER_10]: Outside the story.

2196
02:43:19,299 --> 02:43:26,903
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, I kind of think for Loki, I don't mean to put words in your mouth, but I always got the sense you're an open world explorer, do your own thing kind of guy.

2197
02:43:27,543 --> 02:43:30,565
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what you like out of Grand Theft Auto way more than the story.

2198
02:43:30,945 --> 02:43:37,068
[SPEAKER_07]: I would say that there's a lot more depth that's been put in place aside from Vice City, what came out in 2002.

2199
02:43:37,108 --> 02:43:37,408
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, that's...

2200
02:43:40,770 --> 02:43:54,925
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't judge a game now like Grand Theft Auto 5 based on Grand Theft Auto 1 or even some of the games that were in the early 3D series, 3 through Vice City and that kind of stuff.

2201
02:43:55,445 --> 02:44:00,367
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just, it's so different now that they have a lot more writing involved in the characters.

2202
02:44:00,447 --> 02:44:06,729
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not just, hey, it's this Haitian guy, he's a gang member now and stuff.

2203
02:44:06,989 --> 02:44:09,549
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot more to it, unfortunately.

2204
02:44:11,750 --> 02:44:12,851
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not really going to go there.

2205
02:44:13,271 --> 02:44:27,863
[SPEAKER_07]: Granted, yeah, some of the earlier games are probably more like that where it's like, hey, we've got the triads and they're going to act Chinese and oh, hey, we've got this gang and this nationality because they were limited what they could do as far as looks and stuff.

2206
02:44:27,883 --> 02:44:30,385
[SPEAKER_07]: They couldn't get that many characters that look different.

2207
02:44:30,405 --> 02:44:30,826
[SPEAKER_07]: Memory.

2208
02:44:30,846 --> 02:44:31,106
[SPEAKER_07]: Memory.

2209
02:44:31,724 --> 02:44:45,824
[SPEAKER_04]: also if I may say something he made a point though that is something that I have very recently said to my mother freedom of speech does not mean freedom from consequence and so they if I'm sure they had to have anticipated some fallout from it so

2210
02:44:47,230 --> 02:44:49,732
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

2211
02:45:09,191 --> 02:45:33,593
[SPEAKER_10]: and there's a double standard in gaming media and it sickens me says the email and then he goes on a great deal to talk about Steam Machine and I'm going to apologize because this is the part I've really got to trim down for time but basically he says A. People who don't already have PCs are not going to buy $1,000 hardware and $200 yearly upgrades for the privilege of being locked to a single vendor and losing all the portability and control they enjoy on consoles.

2212
02:45:33,633 --> 02:45:34,034
[SPEAKER_10]: I think there's a

2213
02:45:34,654 --> 02:45:41,240
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a little bit of worry that the Steam machine is not going to give you the plug-and-play that PCs essentially give you in the build-your-own-PC world.

2214
02:45:41,260 --> 02:45:43,882
[SPEAKER_10]: You don't have that same freedom, and I get that.

2215
02:45:44,923 --> 02:45:47,726
[SPEAKER_10]: And he kind of draws comparisons to 3DO with that as well.

2216
02:45:49,527 --> 02:45:58,815
[SPEAKER_10]: And then he talks about how many games... Sorry, I'm trying to paraphrase this here.

2217
02:45:59,476 --> 02:46:00,377
[SPEAKER_10]: It's basically...

2218
02:46:01,801 --> 02:46:16,521
[SPEAKER_10]: if you're invested in Steam you likely know how to get your PC working on the television which also has the bonus of allowing you to play games from anywhere not just Steam how many games particularly games that wouldn't be god awful on any kind of controller don't come to consoles anymore

2219
02:46:16,741 --> 02:46:16,961
[SPEAKER_10]: PCGamers.com

2220
02:46:34,239 --> 02:46:34,900
[SPEAKER_10]: and so on.

2221
02:46:36,481 --> 02:46:38,523
[SPEAKER_10]: Ownership of the software is another huge point.

2222
02:46:39,283 --> 02:46:48,631
[SPEAKER_10]: PC gamers, he says, have gone to Valve in force, but the mainstream market isn't going to spend $60 on title they don't feel like they own.

2223
02:46:49,772 --> 02:46:58,560
[SPEAKER_10]: Steam has lots of sales to alleviate that, but we're never going to get the point where 99 cent or $5 or even $5 to $15 is the norm for new released AAA titles.

2224
02:46:58,980 --> 02:47:05,085
[SPEAKER_10]: Activision would laugh Valve reps right out of the office in mere suggestion of devaluing the massive Call of Duty money machine to get that way.

2225
02:47:05,626 --> 02:47:08,649
[SPEAKER_07]: Activision is kind of in the minority.

2226
02:47:08,669 --> 02:47:19,621
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, they're not in the minority, but them, Take-Two, and EA, the big three guys that put out some massive titles that are also on PC.

2227
02:47:20,322 --> 02:47:23,385
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Call of Duty, it's still $60 on PC.

2228
02:47:23,865 --> 02:47:25,447
[SPEAKER_07]: And that didn't used to be the case.

2229
02:47:25,487 --> 02:47:30,191
[SPEAKER_07]: It used to be $10 cheaper, but they were like, we're Call of Duty, so we can get away with that.

2230
02:47:31,712 --> 02:47:32,993
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's not true for everything.

2231
02:47:33,013 --> 02:47:34,414
[SPEAKER_07]: NBA 2K14 is $30 on PC versus $60 on console.

2232
02:47:34,494 --> 02:47:35,055
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I think...

2233
02:47:42,681 --> 02:47:50,827
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of their bigger titles, yeah, the price point is the same as console, but there's also modding support with some of these games.

2234
02:47:50,927 --> 02:47:54,969
[SPEAKER_07]: There's also all the different features it can get on PC.

2235
02:47:55,109 --> 02:47:59,713
[SPEAKER_07]: Plus, the PC retail market, there's not really a big retail market anymore for PC.

2236
02:47:59,773 --> 02:48:05,456
[SPEAKER_07]: Good luck finding the one rack that they have at GameStop or something that has your PC product.

2237
02:48:05,476 --> 02:48:11,020
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the biggest point I get from this email that I really want to call out, and this will be the last thing I say about this email.

2238
02:48:11,040 --> 02:48:12,081
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to read this one paragraph.

2239
02:48:12,881 --> 02:48:40,752
[SPEAKER_10]: all this of course ignores the likely fact that these things will almost certainly not be heavily promoted by GameStop or Best Buy at least in a manner other than trade in your steam machine here both of who have very lucrative pre-owned programs that they won't put in jeopardy good luck selling a box with no mainstream appeal at Walmart especially the mostly disinterested hardware partners who aren't going to make a massive push without software compensation I do get that point and it is a good question to ask who is this for?

2240
02:48:42,242 --> 02:48:42,883
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

2241
02:48:42,963 --> 02:48:43,443
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the thing.

2242
02:48:43,903 --> 02:48:47,386
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't understand.

2243
02:48:48,227 --> 02:48:49,007
[SPEAKER_10]: He does make a point.

2244
02:48:49,268 --> 02:48:53,531
[SPEAKER_10]: The hardcore PC users already figured out how to hook these things up to their TV.

2245
02:48:53,831 --> 02:49:02,138
[SPEAKER_10]: The casuals aren't going to buy something like this when there's the consoles and other, especially at a Walmart, there's lots of cheaper stuff sitting on the shelves.

2246
02:49:02,458 --> 02:49:03,539
[SPEAKER_10]: Who is this really for?

2247
02:49:04,781 --> 02:49:09,744
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, because, you know, the thing is that they're going to compete with consoles.

2248
02:49:09,764 --> 02:49:11,265
[SPEAKER_07]: They have to compete with price.

2249
02:49:11,285 --> 02:49:17,029
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, because this is, look at, we give, at least I give shit to Xbox One for being $100 more than the PlayStation 4.

2250
02:49:17,730 --> 02:49:23,494
[SPEAKER_07]: But, fuck, a PC with a Titan graphics card is not going to be anywhere near $500.

2251
02:49:24,814 --> 02:49:25,695
[SPEAKER_07]: That shit's going to be like $1,500.

2252
02:49:27,196 --> 02:49:34,219
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, so to give a counterpoint to Ross Steele's email, let me go to our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com and I think this is a good way to end it on.

2253
02:49:34,659 --> 02:49:39,662
[SPEAKER_10]: Dungeon Buster says, who says that Valve might decide to go the general retail route at all?

2254
02:49:40,382 --> 02:49:50,867
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think that's a good point and maybe something we need to consider that maybe the media, gaming media or whatever you want to call it, maybe we're making a bigger deal out of this than it really is.

2255
02:49:52,881 --> 02:49:53,201
[SPEAKER_10]: Who knows?

2256
02:49:53,522 --> 02:49:54,402
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, let's move on.

2257
02:49:55,763 --> 02:49:56,464
[SPEAKER_10]: Lots of email tonight.

2258
02:49:56,484 --> 02:50:00,688
[SPEAKER_07]: I fully look forward to the Origins machine, you know.

2259
02:50:00,828 --> 02:50:01,628
[SPEAKER_10]: No thanks.

2260
02:50:01,708 --> 02:50:02,189
[SPEAKER_10]: Pass.

2261
02:50:02,789 --> 02:50:03,029
[SPEAKER_10]: Pass.

2262
02:50:03,310 --> 02:50:09,475
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, let's get to the FUs of the week where we get a little angsty on the show because... Because...

2263
02:50:24,700 --> 02:50:29,884
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, my FU goes back to the wasp from last week because the stinger finally came out.

2264
02:50:31,064 --> 02:50:33,346
[SPEAKER_04]: And my finger hurts a lot less now, thankfully.

2265
02:50:33,826 --> 02:50:39,250
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, FU to the blisters on the bottoms of my feet that are right up at the top by the toes because I was stupid.

2266
02:50:39,830 --> 02:50:41,071
[SPEAKER_04]: I take responsibility for this.

2267
02:50:41,451 --> 02:50:46,515
[SPEAKER_04]: I wore my Vibrams walking on concrete and I hadn't worn them in a long time, so I rubbed my foot a little bit raw.

2268
02:50:47,415 --> 02:50:50,357
[SPEAKER_04]: And then an FU to Wasabi, the restaurant.

2269
02:50:51,258 --> 02:50:55,679
[SPEAKER_04]: Their sushi is normally very, very good, but they put sriracha damn near everything.

2270
02:50:56,319 --> 02:51:01,580
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, thankfully it wasn't touching my food, except that I think that there was some in my food.

2271
02:51:01,620 --> 02:51:09,122
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there was some cross-contamination going on because I broke out in hives and my throat swelled and I had to take lots of Benadryl when I got home.

2272
02:51:09,282 --> 02:51:14,763
[SPEAKER_04]: So, and for me, my food allergies, yeah, they're weird, but they're easily avoidable.

2273
02:51:15,583 --> 02:51:18,264
[SPEAKER_04]: So, fuck sriracha.

2274
02:51:20,273 --> 02:51:23,375
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess you didn't buy into those Sriracha Lays chips when they were out either.

2275
02:51:24,535 --> 02:51:26,556
[SPEAKER_04]: Dan told me that those just tasted like hot ketchup.

2276
02:51:27,416 --> 02:51:27,776
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki.

2277
02:51:29,537 --> 02:51:32,678
[SPEAKER_07]: F you to my head hurting.

2278
02:51:34,079 --> 02:51:35,780
[SPEAKER_07]: I think allergies because my eyes are burning too.

2279
02:51:37,940 --> 02:51:41,602
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll just give a quick F you to the stress of putting on a show and directing it.

2280
02:51:42,442 --> 02:51:46,964
[SPEAKER_10]: As much as I am very proud of the people that are working very hard to do this show and I know it's going to be great.

2281
02:51:47,904 --> 02:51:49,405
[SPEAKER_10]: I want my free days back.

2282
02:51:49,805 --> 02:51:50,545
[SPEAKER_10]: Less stress.

2283
02:51:51,225 --> 02:51:52,746
[SPEAKER_10]: But I've only got six more days to go.

2284
02:51:52,886 --> 02:51:53,826
[SPEAKER_10]: It will be a kickass show.

2285
02:51:53,846 --> 02:51:54,246
[SPEAKER_10]: It really will.

2286
02:51:54,706 --> 02:51:54,986
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

2287
02:51:56,107 --> 02:51:56,587
[SPEAKER_10]: Last up.

2288
02:51:57,087 --> 02:51:57,367
[SPEAKER_10]: Michelle.

2289
02:51:58,088 --> 02:52:01,509
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd like to give an F you to Gina Gershon because she don't know shit.

2290
02:52:02,749 --> 02:52:04,090
[SPEAKER_10]: But she does a great Versace.

2291
02:52:05,310 --> 02:52:07,651
[SPEAKER_10]: Keep in mind, she is playing Versace in a Lifetime movie.

2292
02:52:08,451 --> 02:52:08,891
[SPEAKER_08]: Just saying.

2293
02:52:09,591 --> 02:52:09,912
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

2294
02:52:09,932 --> 02:52:11,032
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

2295
02:52:13,109 --> 02:52:15,172
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't believe you gave an FU to Gina Gershon.

2296
02:52:15,192 --> 02:52:15,833
[SPEAKER_10]: I love that woman.

2297
02:52:16,494 --> 02:52:16,874
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

2298
02:52:17,255 --> 02:52:19,758
[SPEAKER_10]: Just a couple more stories and then we'll do some quick calls.

2299
02:52:19,818 --> 02:52:21,000
[SPEAKER_10]: We're running a little long tonight.

2300
02:52:21,100 --> 02:52:23,243
[SPEAKER_10]: The tech issues earlier put us back.

2301
02:52:23,684 --> 02:52:25,967
[SPEAKER_10]: So you're not going to have a lot of time to get through.

2302
02:52:26,107 --> 02:52:28,951
[SPEAKER_10]: So I will put the call out in just a couple minutes here for calls.

2303
02:52:29,272 --> 02:52:29,972
[SPEAKER_10]: But first, Loki.

2304
02:52:31,707 --> 02:52:34,508
[SPEAKER_07]: So, the Ouya's coming out in European markets.

2305
02:52:35,808 --> 02:52:36,589
[SPEAKER_07]: Is anyone excited?

2306
02:52:37,929 --> 02:52:39,390
[SPEAKER_07]: I know I'm excited.

2307
02:52:40,310 --> 02:52:41,050
[SPEAKER_07]: Europe's excited.

2308
02:52:42,111 --> 02:52:42,471
[SPEAKER_07]: Are they?

2309
02:52:43,011 --> 02:52:43,991
[SPEAKER_07]: Who bought your Ouya?

2310
02:52:44,291 --> 02:52:45,792
[SPEAKER_07]: Was it a listener or just some random?

2311
02:52:45,932 --> 02:52:46,692
[SPEAKER_07]: I think some random guy.

2312
02:52:46,872 --> 02:52:47,212
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, okay.

2313
02:52:47,432 --> 02:52:47,812
[SPEAKER_07]: That's cool.

2314
02:52:48,093 --> 02:52:48,733
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm done with it.

2315
02:52:49,353 --> 02:52:52,534
[SPEAKER_07]: So, wash my hands of that.

2316
02:52:53,154 --> 02:52:54,695
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah, it'll be coming out.

2317
02:52:54,715 --> 02:52:58,096
[SPEAKER_07]: 99 euro in Germany, France, Italy, Australia.

2318
02:52:58,476 --> 02:53:08,564
[SPEAKER_07]: Andrea, Switzerland, Spain, Scandinavia, Norway, Denmark, and late October.

2319
02:53:09,825 --> 02:53:19,172
[SPEAKER_07]: Distributors Flashpoint and Digital Brothers will be handling the distribution duties in Western Europe, while Action and PA will take Eastern Europe.

2320
02:53:21,098 --> 02:53:39,344
[SPEAKER_07]: so hopefully hopefully the people in Europe will be luckier than the people in the US because OUYA themselves can't handle distribution for shit so handing off to somebody else might be a little bit better and I still want to know and I'm probably going to check this right now

2321
02:53:40,024 --> 02:53:49,731
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to know if people still actually haven't gotten their Kickstarter Ooyas because I think there were still some people out there that did not have their Kickstarter Ooyas.

2322
02:53:49,971 --> 02:53:51,432
[SPEAKER_07]: That's sad and such.

2323
02:53:52,813 --> 02:54:01,239
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, speaking of sad, this guy has definitely left his mark on the video game universe, which is funny because he wasn't necessarily a game designer, but...

2324
02:54:01,659 --> 02:54:05,601
[SPEAKER_10]: Tom Clancy passed away this week in Baltimore at age 66.

2325
02:54:26,631 --> 02:54:28,813
[SPEAKER_10]: RedStorm Entertainment RedStorm Entertainment

2326
02:54:45,783 --> 02:54:47,124
[SPEAKER_10]: So rest in peace, Tom Clancy.

2327
02:54:48,906 --> 02:54:49,487
[SPEAKER_10]: That's too bad.

2328
02:54:51,428 --> 02:54:57,954
[SPEAKER_10]: Unfortunately, as time goes on, people that provide our beloved entertainment pass away.

2329
02:54:58,975 --> 02:55:01,297
[SPEAKER_04]: 66 is pretty young.

2330
02:55:01,317 --> 02:55:02,178
[SPEAKER_10]: 66 is still pretty young.

2331
02:55:02,218 --> 02:55:04,701
[SPEAKER_10]: That does make it all the more tragic.

2332
02:55:04,961 --> 02:55:06,082
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

2333
02:55:08,484 --> 02:55:09,424
[SPEAKER_10]: You had some pretty good games.

2334
02:55:09,444 --> 02:55:10,424
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I haven't read those books.

2335
02:55:10,444 --> 02:55:11,525
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, those games are very popular.

2336
02:55:11,545 --> 02:55:13,365
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I'm going to be completely honest.

2337
02:55:13,405 --> 02:55:14,745
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not going to fake it, okay?

2338
02:55:15,246 --> 02:55:23,127
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't really play these games myself, but I listen to other podcasters that really do enjoy these games, and I get why people are really into them.

2339
02:55:23,187 --> 02:55:27,608
[SPEAKER_10]: I think if you're into that military stuff, they are a heck of a lot of fun, or at least they sure sound fun.

2340
02:55:27,648 --> 02:55:29,789
[SPEAKER_10]: But for me, I'm so challenged with the shooting games.

2341
02:55:29,849 --> 02:55:34,090
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's the thing, and hey, actually, we may be past the opportunity for that.

2342
02:55:35,410 --> 02:55:35,791
[SPEAKER_07]: Nevermind.

2343
02:55:35,851 --> 02:55:36,914
[SPEAKER_07]: That was last month, I think.

2344
02:55:36,974 --> 02:55:40,922
[SPEAKER_07]: Rainbow Six Vegas, I remember, was part of the free games with live.

2345
02:55:41,022 --> 02:55:42,806
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah.

2346
02:55:42,826 --> 02:55:45,011
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Halo 3 now.

2347
02:55:46,645 --> 02:55:49,707
[SPEAKER_07]: because, you know, I didn't buy that game at launch or anything.

2348
02:55:50,227 --> 02:55:50,648
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, right?

2349
02:55:50,848 --> 02:55:52,229
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

2350
02:55:52,689 --> 02:55:57,392
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I want to say real quick, as I mentioned, that I think that there might have been some people.

2351
02:55:57,472 --> 02:56:00,534
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep, there are some people from the Kickstarter that still haven't fucking gotten their system yet.

2352
02:56:00,554 --> 02:56:01,275
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's horrible.

2353
02:56:01,615 --> 02:56:03,136
[SPEAKER_07]: And they are not too pleased by that.

2354
02:56:03,556 --> 02:56:05,237
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, gee, I wonder why.

2355
02:56:05,718 --> 02:56:07,219
[SPEAKER_07]: Using such colorful language.

2356
02:56:07,239 --> 02:56:07,799
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

2357
02:56:09,140 --> 02:56:09,360
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

2358
02:56:11,830 --> 02:56:17,732
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, we are going to go ahead and open up the Skype line, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2359
02:56:17,772 --> 02:56:21,353
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, that's 1-877-GAME-OLR or Orange Lounge Radio.

2360
02:56:22,213 --> 02:56:24,594
[SPEAKER_10]: I will go to Twitter as well, but Loki, any last minute stories?

2361
02:56:26,815 --> 02:56:35,477
[SPEAKER_07]: Um... Grand Theft Auto Online, or I should have said Grand Theft Auto is the most played online game right now for, you know, the Xbox 360.

2362
02:56:36,698 --> 02:56:36,918
[SPEAKER_07]: Cool.

2363
02:56:38,118 --> 02:56:38,618
[SPEAKER_07]: I can see that.

2364
02:56:40,479 --> 02:56:40,559
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

2365
02:56:42,598 --> 02:56:44,420
[SPEAKER_10]: That's it.

2366
02:56:44,981 --> 02:56:45,922
[SPEAKER_10]: Nope, the phone's lighting up.

2367
02:56:45,982 --> 02:56:46,863
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll go to Twitter in a minute.

2368
02:56:47,003 --> 02:56:48,365
[SPEAKER_10]: First, we will take a phone call.

2369
02:56:48,485 --> 02:56:49,607
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2370
02:56:49,647 --> 02:56:49,987
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's this?

2371
02:56:50,728 --> 02:56:52,830
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the only one with the fastest internet in the chat room.

2372
02:56:52,870 --> 02:56:53,371
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Ranma.

2373
02:56:53,491 --> 02:56:54,432
[SPEAKER_10]: You got it, Ranma.

2374
02:56:54,452 --> 02:56:55,433
[SPEAKER_10]: What's on your mind tonight, buddy?

2375
02:56:56,154 --> 02:57:01,761
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a lot of things I wanted to bring to the table, but since we're cut for time, I have one thing I do want to bring to the table.

2376
02:57:01,941 --> 02:57:02,402
[SPEAKER_08]: Go for it.

2377
02:57:03,183 --> 02:57:10,767
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, long story short, we're working together with other anime gaming communities to work together.

2378
02:57:10,807 --> 02:57:13,588
[SPEAKER_00]: We're having a fundraiser for a friend of the show.

2379
02:57:14,048 --> 02:57:19,471
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you saw me screaming this out on my Facebook and my Twitter, but we had a friend of the show.

2380
02:57:19,751 --> 02:57:27,115
[SPEAKER_10]: I did see this and my stupid ass forgot to retweet it because I got it while I was working, but please, I think this is great, so please, by all means, pimp away.

2381
02:57:27,717 --> 02:57:31,603
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, we have an Indiegogo going called Love for Venus, A Charity for Kathleen.

2382
02:57:31,963 --> 02:57:38,493
[SPEAKER_00]: Long story short, her and her mom and her friend were driving to AWA and there was a car accident.

2383
02:57:38,673 --> 02:57:42,819
[SPEAKER_00]: She made it through, but unfortunately her mother didn't survive the car accident.

2384
02:57:43,741 --> 02:57:51,749
[SPEAKER_00]: We opened up this Indiegogo fundraiser to help cover for medical and bereavement costs because of various issues.

2385
02:57:52,589 --> 02:57:56,673
[SPEAKER_00]: Within the first day alone of the soft goal, we hit our goal, which was $500.

2386
02:57:58,716 --> 02:58:00,317
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still going strong.

2387
02:58:00,357 --> 02:58:03,360
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still going for the next 39 days, and we've raised $4,850.

2388
02:58:06,343 --> 02:58:07,244
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, that is so good.

2389
02:58:07,544 --> 02:58:08,264
[SPEAKER_10]: That is great.

2390
02:58:08,404 --> 02:58:09,024
[SPEAKER_10]: Because you know what?

2391
02:58:09,064 --> 02:58:10,345
[SPEAKER_10]: Funerals ain't free, y'all.

2392
02:58:11,366 --> 02:58:24,172
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's, I mean, I can't imagine what this poor girl who just lost her mother in a horrific, you know, accident has to be going through, you know, and to even like, you know, she's trying to pull through this thing herself.

2393
02:58:24,252 --> 02:58:25,452
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like, this is awful.

2394
02:58:25,973 --> 02:58:30,295
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm really glad to see the communities there and supporting and putting money where their mouth is, so to speak.

2395
02:58:31,854 --> 02:58:33,115
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

2396
02:59:00,560 --> 02:59:02,261
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for watching!

2397
02:59:20,347 --> 02:59:23,268
[SPEAKER_00]: as one giant family to help one of our own.

2398
02:59:23,928 --> 02:59:26,109
[SPEAKER_10]: And Atlanta is the place for that to happen, too.

2399
02:59:26,189 --> 02:59:28,910
[SPEAKER_10]: I saw that at DragonCon with everybody coming together.

2400
02:59:29,491 --> 02:59:35,453
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I'm sure Anime Weekend Atlanta is probably just the cool-down convention from DragonCon in some way.

2401
02:59:35,493 --> 02:59:36,113
[SPEAKER_10]: I shouldn't say that.

2402
02:59:36,133 --> 02:59:42,536
[SPEAKER_10]: That might be offensive to some, but I don't mean it to be whatsoever because I think I had such a blast at DragonCon.

2403
02:59:43,136 --> 02:59:45,577
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sure Atlanta puts on some great stuff.

2404
02:59:46,383 --> 02:59:47,143
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you a hint.

2405
02:59:47,204 --> 02:59:49,265
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how you know this is your cool-down con.

2406
02:59:49,565 --> 02:59:55,168
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're at the convention and you find yourself drinking more than anything else, that's your cool-down con.

2407
02:59:57,570 --> 02:59:58,130
[SPEAKER_10]: I like that.

2408
02:59:58,150 --> 02:59:59,411
[SPEAKER_00]: We did a lot of that at Fonami, though.

2409
03:00:00,131 --> 03:00:00,671
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep.

2410
03:00:02,312 --> 03:00:07,295
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember trying to find the one vending machine that actually had soda that wasn't horribly expensive.

2411
03:00:08,296 --> 03:00:15,480
[SPEAKER_00]: And you were ready to jump over that counter at that woman who couldn't serve us alcohol because it was closed or something like that.

2412
03:00:17,162 --> 03:00:18,463
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank God for Pineapple Malibu.

2413
03:00:19,544 --> 03:00:25,809
[SPEAKER_10]: Ranma, one more time, what is the link for the Indiegogo you said?

2414
03:00:26,509 --> 03:00:44,022
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, the short version is igg.me slash at slash loveforvenus The main Facebook page is facebook.com slash projectlovevenus and there is a little button that takes you to this information on our website at animejamsession.com

2415
03:00:45,171 --> 03:00:46,231
[SPEAKER_10]: That sounds awesome.

2416
03:00:47,211 --> 03:00:48,392
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for all you're doing for that.

2417
03:00:48,452 --> 03:00:50,432
[SPEAKER_10]: It's such gamer good news this week.

2418
03:00:50,452 --> 03:00:55,733
[SPEAKER_10]: I talked about the Gemet breast cancer stream earlier and now you've got this going on.

2419
03:00:56,714 --> 03:00:59,634
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sure there's lots of other great charitable events going on at the gaming community.

2420
03:00:59,654 --> 03:01:04,356
[SPEAKER_10]: We're starting to get into that season with the holiday season where there's going to be a lot of child's play fundraiser events.

2421
03:01:04,576 --> 03:01:06,076
[SPEAKER_10]: So very excited to see that.

2422
03:01:06,576 --> 03:01:07,057
[SPEAKER_10]: Definitely.

2423
03:01:07,677 --> 03:01:07,938
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

2424
03:01:08,378 --> 03:01:16,447
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, Ranma, I will let you go so we can get some more calls, but take care and everybody should listen to Anime Jam Session Tuesdays at 6.30 Pacific, 9.30 Eastern Time.

2425
03:01:16,908 --> 03:01:17,388
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right.

2426
03:01:17,528 --> 03:01:18,690
[SPEAKER_10]: Right after Electric Sisterhood.

2427
03:01:19,270 --> 03:01:19,671
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure enough.

2428
03:01:19,951 --> 03:01:20,552
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, take care.

2429
03:01:20,572 --> 03:01:21,533
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, thank you.

2430
03:01:21,553 --> 03:01:21,893
[SPEAKER_10]: Bye.

2431
03:01:21,913 --> 03:01:22,073
[SPEAKER_10]: Bye.

2432
03:01:22,794 --> 03:01:24,114
[SPEAKER_10]: 1-877-GAME-OLR 1-877-GAME-OLR 1-877-GAME-OLR

2433
03:01:48,400 --> 03:01:48,981
[SPEAKER_10]: Weirdness.

2434
03:01:49,041 --> 03:01:50,883
[SPEAKER_10]: But we do have another call coming in, so let's go to it.

2435
03:01:51,223 --> 03:01:52,244
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello, you're on Orange Sons Radio.

2436
03:01:52,264 --> 03:01:52,584
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's this?

2437
03:01:53,425 --> 03:01:54,286
[SPEAKER_10]: Legend of Zaku here.

2438
03:01:54,346 --> 03:01:55,567
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, haven't heard from you in a while.

2439
03:01:55,587 --> 03:01:56,448
[SPEAKER_10]: How you doing, Zaku?

2440
03:01:57,008 --> 03:01:57,809
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing fine.

2441
03:01:57,969 --> 03:02:05,396
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I've been at my girl's place for a few weekends now, but other than that, I've been missing out on all hours.

2442
03:02:05,476 --> 03:02:08,499
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm playing catch-up while she's in Europe for a few weeks.

2443
03:02:08,960 --> 03:02:12,883
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, well, I suppose we can forgive this one time.

2444
03:02:12,903 --> 03:02:13,424
[SPEAKER_10]: But what's on your mind?

2445
03:02:14,976 --> 03:02:18,880
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing much, just trying to whore out GTA V as much as I can.

2446
03:02:19,741 --> 03:02:25,326
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been pretty much the centerpiece of my gaming life for the past few weeks now.

2447
03:02:25,987 --> 03:02:28,929
[SPEAKER_10]: So what is it about this game that just makes you so crazy about it?

2448
03:02:29,910 --> 03:02:30,291
[SPEAKER_01]: Trevor.

2449
03:02:31,092 --> 03:02:33,574
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to spoil it, but just that character alone.

2450
03:02:34,995 --> 03:02:37,357
[SPEAKER_01]: I see Loki smiling over there, so you get it?

2451
03:02:40,740 --> 03:02:51,003
[SPEAKER_01]: and I probably haven't even gotten through half the game and already he's already proven to be the batshit insane one.

2452
03:02:52,584 --> 03:02:54,344
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise the others are just as fucked up.

2453
03:02:55,045 --> 03:02:56,725
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like Michael and Franklin.

2454
03:02:56,785 --> 03:03:05,568
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, that's what I've been doing so far and trying to get myself in that Steam Machine beta.

2455
03:03:06,524 --> 03:03:08,085
[SPEAKER_10]: I think a lot of people are with you there.

2456
03:03:08,586 --> 03:03:09,446
[SPEAKER_10]: Good luck, though.

2457
03:03:09,927 --> 03:03:12,008
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope somebody in the Oil Army gets one.

2458
03:03:12,248 --> 03:03:14,610
[SPEAKER_10]: And please give us the exclusive hearts.

2459
03:03:15,950 --> 03:03:16,731
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I know.

2460
03:03:16,771 --> 03:03:17,792
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it took a while.

2461
03:03:17,832 --> 03:03:24,856
[SPEAKER_01]: All I had to do was just, like... The last thing I had to do was play something with a controller, which I was able to do a few days ago.

2462
03:03:24,956 --> 03:03:26,477
[SPEAKER_01]: But other than that, I'm already in.

2463
03:03:26,497 --> 03:03:29,679
[SPEAKER_10]: What was I going to say?

2464
03:03:30,040 --> 03:03:30,160
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh...

2465
03:03:32,142 --> 03:03:33,924
[SPEAKER_10]: What about Grand Theft Auto 5 Online?

2466
03:03:33,964 --> 03:03:35,124
[SPEAKER_10]: Have you been dipping into that at all?

2467
03:03:35,144 --> 03:03:37,106
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't done that yet.

2468
03:03:37,606 --> 03:03:46,432
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I've made it a personal mission of mine to just wait it out as much as possible instead of having to deal with the disappointment of not getting in.

2469
03:03:47,292 --> 03:03:48,993
[SPEAKER_01]: And speaking of which, have you guys...

2470
03:03:50,214 --> 03:03:53,378
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

2471
03:04:03,059 --> 03:04:16,649
[SPEAKER_07]: If you go to the Rockstar Social Club, which I believe is socialclub.rockstar.com, and then you can go to, I think it's slash crews and then slash VOG Network would be how you would get to it.

2472
03:04:17,469 --> 03:04:22,133
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so socialclub.rockstargames.com slash crews slash VOG Network.

2473
03:04:23,133 --> 03:04:27,216
[SPEAKER_07]: And the other option would be to also go into our forums, and we have a link there, too.

2474
03:04:28,517 --> 03:04:28,818
[SPEAKER_01]: I see.

2475
03:04:29,598 --> 03:04:39,147
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, I guess I'll end up trying that and hopefully it won't be as... Try to shoot Loki a bunch for me since I don't know when I'll get in there.

2476
03:04:40,188 --> 03:04:50,117
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you gotta give Rockstar credit given the fact that they're doing their best to try to lurch this thing forward as much as possible without any false starts.

2477
03:04:50,817 --> 03:04:53,560
[SPEAKER_01]: But then again, it's like a bad week to be an IT grunt.

2478
03:04:55,831 --> 03:05:09,036
[SPEAKER_01]: if it's not Grand Theft Auto Online it's the health exchanges basically not being up so it's basically all around there's demand for just about everything the woes of being popular on the internet

2479
03:05:09,778 --> 03:05:10,479
[SPEAKER_10]: That is true.

2480
03:05:11,239 --> 03:05:13,021
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, Zaku, I got to let you go.

2481
03:05:13,321 --> 03:05:14,122
[SPEAKER_10]: We got to go wrap up.

2482
03:05:14,142 --> 03:05:15,203
[SPEAKER_10]: But thank you so much for the call, buddy.

2483
03:05:15,924 --> 03:05:16,124
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.

2484
03:05:16,344 --> 03:05:16,604
[SPEAKER_10]: Take care.

2485
03:05:16,624 --> 03:05:17,045
[SPEAKER_10]: Have a good one.

2486
03:05:17,205 --> 03:05:19,006
[SPEAKER_10]: Have fun shooting people in Grand Theft Auto.

2487
03:05:19,947 --> 03:05:20,708
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, will do.

2488
03:05:20,868 --> 03:05:21,148
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

2489
03:05:21,429 --> 03:05:21,989
[SPEAKER_10]: Stay good.

2490
03:05:22,590 --> 03:05:22,910
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

2491
03:05:23,611 --> 03:05:25,813
[SPEAKER_10]: And sadly, guys, I am going to close up the Skyblind.

2492
03:05:25,873 --> 03:05:26,593
[SPEAKER_10]: I am so sorry.

2493
03:05:26,673 --> 03:05:28,395
[SPEAKER_10]: I know there were more trying to get through, but...

2494
03:05:28,735 --> 03:05:29,996
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura loves to read your emails.

2495
03:05:30,036 --> 03:05:30,417
[SPEAKER_10]: Speaking of...

2496
03:05:48,493 --> 03:05:48,853
[SPEAKER_10]: tweets.

2497
03:05:48,893 --> 03:05:50,834
[SPEAKER_10]: I wanted to read a couple just real quick here.

2498
03:05:51,414 --> 03:05:52,654
[SPEAKER_10]: TigerClaw sent us a couple.

2499
03:05:52,994 --> 03:06:00,476
[SPEAKER_10]: We talked about the offline SimCity one earlier, so let me do this one, which is Activision Blizzard turning the patent battle up a notch.

2500
03:06:01,156 --> 03:06:03,377
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't even know there was a thing going on there with that.

2501
03:06:04,337 --> 03:06:05,138
[SPEAKER_10]: Trying to bring it up here.

2502
03:06:06,838 --> 03:06:07,318
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see.

2503
03:06:07,398 --> 03:06:09,339
[SPEAKER_10]: This is when they got sued over Worlds Inc.

2504
03:06:09,459 --> 03:06:10,739
[SPEAKER_10]: on an online game patent.

2505
03:06:11,179 --> 03:06:14,820
[SPEAKER_10]: Activision Blizzard is suing back over different online game patents.

2506
03:06:16,021 --> 03:06:17,061
[SPEAKER_10]: So, essentially...

2507
03:06:18,277 --> 03:06:19,638
[SPEAKER_10]: What is the Worlds game?

2508
03:06:19,878 --> 03:06:25,340
[SPEAKER_10]: Worlds Player Software was a toolkit for creating 3D multiplayer online worlds.

2509
03:06:25,760 --> 03:06:34,983
[SPEAKER_10]: This goes all the way back to 2008 when Worlds did a lawsuit against NCSoft claiming City of Heroes violated its virtual space patent.

2510
03:06:35,483 --> 03:06:38,184
[SPEAKER_10]: It was dismissed after the two companies settled.

2511
03:06:38,624 --> 03:06:45,047
[SPEAKER_10]: But it looks like Activision Blizzard is not going to settle anytime soon and they are taking these patent guys to court.

2512
03:06:46,007 --> 03:06:47,768
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope they can get that all sorted out.

2513
03:06:47,888 --> 03:06:53,910
[SPEAKER_10]: I think patent laws need to be reexamined in this country myself because we hear a lot about these patent messes all the time.

2514
03:06:54,490 --> 03:06:56,511
[SPEAKER_10]: But that's just me and that's probably for another week.

2515
03:06:56,531 --> 03:06:58,772
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of shit in this country that needs to be fixed.

2516
03:07:00,332 --> 03:07:01,373
[SPEAKER_10]: But unfortunately, we're out of time.

2517
03:07:02,513 --> 03:07:04,294
[SPEAKER_10]: Chell, I want to thank you so much for being here tonight.

2518
03:07:04,534 --> 03:07:04,974
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

2519
03:07:05,394 --> 03:07:10,756
[SPEAKER_10]: I know you didn't get to say a lot, a lot outside, but the stuff you did say, I had to fist bump you several times tonight.

2520
03:07:10,816 --> 03:07:13,277
[SPEAKER_10]: So thank you for your viewpoint tonight.

2521
03:07:13,777 --> 03:07:15,358
[SPEAKER_10]: And please come back again sometime soon.

2522
03:07:15,778 --> 03:07:39,084
[SPEAKER_11]: and thank you so much for having me as soon as I can anything you want to plug even if that's your friend's game again or what have you I kind of want to plug another game too it's also an indie game forgot to plug it earlier it doesn't have a demo out yet but once it does I am downloading that shit it's called Coral Cove completely traditional art illustrated and animated so cool

2523
03:07:39,696 --> 03:07:40,217
[SPEAKER_10]: Very nice.

2524
03:07:40,737 --> 03:07:45,762
[SPEAKER_10]: And Gabe, if you're out there listening, prime candidate right here in studio.

2525
03:07:45,943 --> 03:07:49,146
[SPEAKER_10]: Hire this woman when she finishes up all her schooling.

2526
03:07:49,186 --> 03:07:49,847
[SPEAKER_10]: I think she'd be great.

2527
03:07:50,527 --> 03:07:50,868
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

2528
03:07:51,909 --> 03:07:54,211
[SPEAKER_10]: Last but not least, we go around and we get the final thoughts.

2529
03:07:54,732 --> 03:08:00,818
[SPEAKER_10]: I do want to say real quick though before we get the final thoughts, thank you guys so much for listening to our program, supporting the show.

2530
03:08:01,158 --> 03:08:02,880
[SPEAKER_10]: Supporting independent broadcasting.

2531
03:08:02,920 --> 03:08:04,983
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for taking the time out of your day to listen to us.

2532
03:08:05,404 --> 03:08:07,446
[SPEAKER_10]: If you're staying up late listening to us live, thank you.

2533
03:08:08,027 --> 03:08:09,248
[SPEAKER_10]: Your support means the world.

2534
03:08:09,769 --> 03:08:14,815
[SPEAKER_10]: All we ask, if you do enjoy what you hear here at Orange Lounge Radio, tell a friend or two or five about the show.

2535
03:08:15,296 --> 03:08:19,882
[SPEAKER_10]: And yeah, help spread the word about Orange Lounge Radio and we will grow our family even more.

2536
03:08:21,163 --> 03:08:47,897
[SPEAKER_10]: don't forget about the podcast awards thing too just again for your consideration we would love it if you'd take the 15 seconds to go to podcastawards.com and nominate us for people's choice and best gaming but even if you don't choose to nominate us be sure to keep it independent because the commercial guys don't need the additional exposure they already have plenty of money let's go around and get everybody's final thought I guess I should start with our guest Chell do you have any final thoughts tonight?

2537
03:08:49,597 --> 03:08:51,598
[SPEAKER_11]: It is weird not having anybody come on me.

2538
03:08:53,678 --> 03:08:55,939
[SPEAKER_11]: I had to do the last showgirls reference.

2539
03:08:55,959 --> 03:08:56,800
[SPEAKER_11]: You know I had to.

2540
03:08:58,700 --> 03:09:01,541
[SPEAKER_10]: I like you a lot, even if that quote's gonna get you into trouble.

2541
03:09:01,901 --> 03:09:02,261
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

2542
03:09:03,382 --> 03:09:04,382
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura.

2543
03:09:04,482 --> 03:09:05,923
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know how you're gonna follow that, but good luck.

2544
03:09:05,963 --> 03:09:06,643
[SPEAKER_10]: What's your final thought?

2545
03:09:07,964 --> 03:09:09,665
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, your final thought?

2546
03:09:35,896 --> 03:09:38,559
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm disappointed that I missed the leaked Godzilla trailer.

2547
03:09:39,340 --> 03:09:39,621
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

2548
03:09:40,202 --> 03:09:41,363
[SPEAKER_07]: They're making a new Godzilla?

2549
03:09:41,503 --> 03:09:42,244
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, didn't you know?

2550
03:09:42,424 --> 03:09:43,245
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I remember that.

2551
03:09:43,265 --> 03:09:43,966
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been all over Tumblr.

2552
03:09:43,986 --> 03:09:45,789
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like a Matthew Broderick one, I remember that.

2553
03:09:46,049 --> 03:09:46,610
[SPEAKER_10]: No, this one.

2554
03:09:46,850 --> 03:09:48,051
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like a legit one.

2555
03:09:48,512 --> 03:09:49,233
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, really?

2556
03:09:49,413 --> 03:09:49,593
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

2557
03:09:49,814 --> 03:09:50,214
[SPEAKER_10]: Interesting.

2558
03:09:50,294 --> 03:09:52,197
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, well, have to check that out.

2559
03:09:52,777 --> 03:09:53,058
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2560
03:09:53,078 --> 03:09:53,698
[SPEAKER_10]: It's Matthew Broderick.

2561
03:09:56,457 --> 03:09:57,338
[SPEAKER_07]: He's Godzilla.

2562
03:09:59,299 --> 03:10:01,061
[SPEAKER_07]: What happened to my career?

2563
03:10:02,502 --> 03:10:03,643
[SPEAKER_07]: Good things, apparently.

2564
03:10:04,023 --> 03:10:05,684
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Matthew Broderick, yeah.

2565
03:10:06,325 --> 03:10:10,188
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah, no, no, the other guy, Breaking Bad and all that, yeah, but... What happened to my career?

2566
03:10:10,388 --> 03:10:11,509
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm making tons of money!

2567
03:10:11,789 --> 03:10:13,911
[SPEAKER_10]: Matthew Broderick, well, I think he went to stage.

2568
03:10:14,031 --> 03:10:15,032
[SPEAKER_10]: I think he's done a lot with stage.

2569
03:10:15,332 --> 03:10:19,915
[SPEAKER_10]: Election was one of my favorite movies ever, and that was like 13 years ago.

2570
03:10:19,955 --> 03:10:20,536
[SPEAKER_02]: The producers...

2571
03:10:21,411 --> 03:10:21,991
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that's true.

2572
03:10:22,011 --> 03:10:23,853
[SPEAKER_10]: That's why I think he's done more stage type of stuff.

2573
03:10:24,974 --> 03:10:26,195
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, there we go.

2574
03:10:26,475 --> 03:10:26,975
[SPEAKER_10]: That's it.

2575
03:10:27,155 --> 03:10:28,777
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you again for tuning into the show.

2576
03:10:29,457 --> 03:10:32,299
[SPEAKER_10]: Have fun with your games, people, and we will see you next time.

2577
03:10:32,400 --> 03:10:36,022
[SPEAKER_10]: Next week, we'll do it all over again here at Orange Lounge Radio.

2578
03:10:36,483 --> 03:10:36,763
[SPEAKER_10]: Good night.

2579
03:10:37,597 --> 03:10:40,158
[SPEAKER_05]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
