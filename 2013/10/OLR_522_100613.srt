Nintendo announces another hit game delay

Hello my friends out there on the internet

00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
And welcome back to another week of the show

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Where every gamer has a voice

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
It is Orange Lounge Radio

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Live with episode number 522

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
For this October the 6th of 2013

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
It is officially October

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Only how many more days to Halloween? 25

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
If I did my math right

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
And she'll keep me in check for sure

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Here she is everybody

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
DarkSakura or Jamie Summers?

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Meh

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
No it's not on, now it's on meh

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Did I do my math right?

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I don't care

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Math sucks

26
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Why are you meh? Sunday is fun day

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Because I'm waiting for Halloween to be over

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
So I can buy Purim costumes

29
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Fair enough

30
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
And then get all the candy on sale

31
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
And then make like candy corn muffins or something

32
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Actually I am planning

33
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Even though I'm not doing sugar very much

34
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm planning on making candy corn vodka

35
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Hooray

36
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Vodka doesn't count

37
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
If you're gonna drink something

38
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Vodka is the best for you anyway

39
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Well it liquefies the candy corn

40
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
So it's like candy corn syrup mixed in vodka

41
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Oh my gosh

42
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I bet some people would find that absolutely disgusting though

43
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
It's amazeballs

44
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I have to ask you though, what do you think about

45
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Because we do talk about video games

46
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
The gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle, it is a video game show

47
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
But let's be real, it's also a foodie show

48
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Because we always talk about food on this show

49
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
So I have to ask you DarkSaga

50
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
What do you think about this time of year

51
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Where it's pumpkin all the things

52
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
And then candy corn

53
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
And it's like candy corn oreos

54
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
This is the time of year

55
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
That I actually make my

56
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I kind of call it gourd soup

57
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
But I make

58
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Butternut squash pumpkin and sweet potato soup

59
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Yummy

60
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
And it's really creamy

61
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
But now the way that I make these is I make them all savory

62
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
So I put like garlic and rosemary

63
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
And all kinds of savory herbs in it

64
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
So that it's sweet and savory at the same time

65
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
And you guys, she's gonna bring some to the next show

66
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Yay! Maybe I will

67
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I've actually got the stuff to make my soup

68
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
And this time I have

69
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Purple mountain yams

70
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
To add in it this time

71
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
This sounds delicious, I can't wait

72
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
All the listeners are hungry now

73
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
But everybody should be jealous of my amazing dinner

74
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Because I had rabbit and beef liver

75
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
For dinner

76
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
You know what, Bugs was delicious

77
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
If my sister could hear you

78
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
She would hate you, she's a bunny enthusiast

79
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And she loves bunnies

80
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I love bunnies too, they're fun and I'm allergic to them

81
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
But they're soft and fun to pet and delicious

82
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Alright look

83
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com

84
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
We'll start off tonight with

85
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Rama who says, too much fucking pumpkin

86
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Yo

87
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Well, even our chatters have wrong opinions sometimes

88
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Here at Orange Lounge Radio

89
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
But after all it is the show where every gamer has a voice

90
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I don't like pumpkin

91
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
And there he is, Techmaster Loki, what's wrong with you?

92
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I don't like pumpkin

93
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
You don't like pumpkin? No

94
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Well some people think I'm weird

95
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Because I don't like mayonnaise

96
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I don't think I introduced myself, I'm Rob Roberts by the way

97
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
If you don't know me, I'm Rob Roberts and I hate mayonnaise

98
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I can understand eating straight up mayonnaise

99
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
But honest sandwich is fine

100
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Or chicken salad

101
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Or everything with mayonnaise

102
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Okay, Alan and I went and got sushi

103
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
And we got this one roll and I was kind of like

104
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Think that's a mayo based sauce

105
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
And I'm going to have to kind of like eat the edges

106
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
You know what, I got sushi the other day

107
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
And I had an allergic reaction to it

108
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Because you know what was mixed in with the crab?

109
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
What? Sriracha

110
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Oh no, sriracha crab?

111
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
That's weird It was how they made their spicy crab

112
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
They mixed sriracha in with the crab

113
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
And normally I'm fine with spicy crab

114
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Because it's just like maybe a little

115
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Something else hot, but they mixed sriracha in it

116
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Which I'm like stupidly allergic to

117
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
So I actually still have a hive

118
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
And it hurts

119
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Let's see, going to Raginator in our chat room

120
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Says pumpkin flavored mayonnaise

121
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I'm sorry, that won't work for me

122
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Just like it probably won't work for Loki

123
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
That's not okay

124
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Well here's the thing, I don't understand

125
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Like putting mayonnaise on like

126
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Hot things

127
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
You know like with a sandwich it's okay

128
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
But like people put it on burgers

129
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Or they'll like get a sandwich at like a sandwich place

130
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Yeah I like that toasted

131
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
It's like okay cool, now it's like this nasty

132
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Hot mayonnaise

133
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I am literally gagging right now

134
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
And I don't mean like fashion runway

135
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I'm gagging at that, I mean like I am actually about to barf

136
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
When you're talking about that

137
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I won't tell you about what my mom used to eat as a snack

138
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
No, ugh

139
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Canned pears with mayonnaise and cheese

140
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
This is horrible I actually grew up on that

141
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
It's pretty good Alright look, we need to talk about video games

142
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
What about like a mayonnaise flavored

143
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Flurry or something like that

144
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
What's wrong with you people? I like homemade mayonnaise

145
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
As a garnish on dishes

146
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Look, be nice everybody and respectful

147
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Cause we got a guest here in studio tonight

148
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I bet she likes mayonnaise

149
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
She might, we're gonna say hello to our guest here

150
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
It's actually her second time on the show

151
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
But you know welcome back

152
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
As the case may be to Chell is here tonight

153
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Well thank you very much for having me

154
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Chell, I think you can like

155
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Chow? Chell

156
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Chell, it's Chell, I keep thinking Chell

157
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
You're a hero and a half Chell

158
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Sorry Chell

159
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
You know the computer name

160
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
from Portal I can't even think about

161
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
pronouncing in real life so you're in good company

162
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Alright fair enough

163
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
So you were on the show before

164
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
and you talked about what kinds of things

165
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
We did talk about your love of Portal on the last show

166
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Oh yes and my deep deep love affair

167
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
with Earthbound slash Mother

168
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Have you seen, I think this happened after

169
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
you were on the show, have you seen it's on Wii U virtual console now?

170
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
No I did not

171
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I could get that puppy over here right

172
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
now for you to check out, it's awesome

173
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
That would be awesome

174
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I need to play more of it to be honest

175
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Have you checked out anything lately?

176
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I know we're going to get into gaming weeks a little later

177
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
but what kind of stuff have you been into in general

178
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
as of late?

179
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Since I've been busy, I've been getting my nostalgia on

180
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
with old Lucas Arts stuff and

181
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
a lot of free RPG stuff

182
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
You people light up my life

183
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
with your independent

184
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
RPGs that are fan made stuff

185
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
but at the same time guys

186
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
sometimes you need to work on your programming

187
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
because you know

188
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I want to meet you half way but

189
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
when I no clip into a shelf

190
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
yeah

191
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
There's such good stuff out there though

192
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
There are a lot of great indie RPGs

193
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
and the great thing about RPGs is that

194
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
they take forever to beat usually

195
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
so they're a great time sink and I'm thinking of things like

196
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Cthulhu Saves the World

197
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Have you played any of that stuff?

198
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Adorbs

199
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Are you a Steam user?

200
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
My computer is broke as hell

201
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
It's also 4 years old

202
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
It's doing some interesting breakage right now in fact

203
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Well if you're able to

204
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
put some band aids on it

205
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
check out Steam and some of these indie

206
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
RPGs are like $1.50

207
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Nice

208
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
They'll be a winner sale as there always is

209
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
going into New Years and such this year

210
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
It'll be like

211
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
hand us a couple quarters and here's like 50 games

212
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Sales all the things

213
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Exactly

214
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
That's something we're bringing up in part B for people

215
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
who are not on Steam

216
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Absolutely a little teaser

217
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
So Chell will have to pay attention

218
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
in part B there will be a quiz tonight

219
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I don't know if they told you there will be a quiz

220
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
What other stuff do you do for fun Chell?

221
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I haven't been doing much fun lately

222
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I've mostly been working on just

223
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
getting stuff for my degree together

224
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I'm working on a lot of

225
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
learning 3D stuff because one day I hope to

226
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
join the unwashed masses

227
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
and start churning out games like I want to play

228
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Awesome

229
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Have you thought about what would be your dream

230
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
company to work for?

231
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Well Valve obviously

232
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
The minute the words left my mouth

233
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
that was the stupid

234
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Rob doesn't usually ask stupid questions

235
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
haha at least I had to tell myself

236
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
but that one was pretty dumb

237
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
It's not just that

238
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
they make games that I want to play

239
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
it's that they seem like a really

240
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
chill workforce

241
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Have you seen that leaked handbook

242
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
that's online that's like the Valve company

243
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
handbook like what the employees

244
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
get you know their corporate

245
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
culture is so interesting

246
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Valve like I really

247
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
it's just so neat and like I kind of

248
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
think about like gosh if they try to do something

249
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
like that at my day job I just I don't know

250
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
something like that would fly like some industries

251
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
need structure but it's so interesting as

252
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Valve has really pulled off this

253
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
everybody's equal we don't have

254
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
titles your desk is on

255
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
wheels and you roll it where you need to go

256
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
and we don't tell you what to do

257
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
you find projects

258
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
like you guys have to Google

259
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
this if you've never seen this before the Valve handbook

260
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
and technically I don't know if it's legit

261
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
or not but it seems like it

262
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
would be I have no reason to doubt it

263
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Sounds pretty close yeah

264
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
and it's just like so interesting

265
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
that you know

266
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
a person might

267
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
start work at this company and they don't have any

268
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
assignments so they just have to go like find

269
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
something to do but that's the type

270
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
of people they're looking for

271
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
yeah work raising

272
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
alright well unfortunately as we're broadcasting

273
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
live here we're having a little bit of stream troubles

274
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I'm going to keep going for the sake of the

275
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
podcast but for some reason

276
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
we're not actually able to reconnect

277
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
and what's going on

278
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
is actually on server room's

279
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
side because

280
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
we are not able to reconnect at all

281
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
so I'm going to try to

282
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
keep this show going while doing tech

283
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
at the same time

284
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
alright

285
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I

286
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
well you know what we could go

287
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
and bring up our

288
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
next topic we could

289
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
or I have another idea too is that

290
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
since this is for the sake of the podcast

291
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
why don't we do a quick musical interlude

292
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
while we try to fix things

293
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
and then we'll be right back I could sing

294
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
alright you want to sing us out

295
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
fly me to the moon

296
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
no

297
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
To register participation for this week's episode

298
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com

299
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
use the pass phrase dash

300
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
alright we're back that wasn't awkward

301
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
or anything but the joys

302
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
of doing live radio is

303
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
that sometimes the feed just

304
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
the internets go down there's a

305
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
server reboot or something happens

306
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
and the tubes get

307
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
untied or I don't know what happens

308
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
just being a butthole or a cat

309
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
just pulled out the plug let's be real

310
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
that's probably what happened but for

311
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
once that wasn't our fault at least I can say

312
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
so alright

313
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
where were we when we left off

314
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I was talking to the lovely Chell

315
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
over there about the dream company

316
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
she wanted to work for we were talking about Valve

317
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
and just kind of

318
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
what a different type of company

319
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Valve is so let me ask you this

320
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
knowing that the employees at Valve can work on

321
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
whatever project they want

322
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
if you were to get hired by Valve

323
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
hypothetically what would be your dream

324
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
project?

325
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Barring Half Life Part 3

326
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
which may or may not be a thing

327
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
make sure that mics on by the way

328
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
siblings, siblings

329
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
so Barring Half Life Part 3

330
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
oh

331
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
that is a tough one

332
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I really always wanted to

333
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
see a Portal sequel but I just wanted to

334
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
work on something new and fresh

335
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
coming down the pipe

336
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
they kind of hit me where I live

337
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
story wise everything

338
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
they put out is just

339
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
right along the lines of what I try to bring into my fiction

340
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
just you know the continuing themes

341
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
of kind of being alone

342
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
in a strange place and having to kind of survive

343
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
through strange circumstances

344
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
you are a little quiet by the way

345
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
just make sure you talk right in that mic

346
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
so

347
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
you would hope to work on Half Life 3

348
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
or something kind of new

349
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
because I'm a little fancy

350
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
speaking of new and fancy, Valve did make a bunch of announcements

351
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
last week about this Steam Box

352
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
have you been following this news at all?

353
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I'm completely out of the loop

354
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
that's why we're here

355
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
to help you stay current

356
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
the Steam Box they announced is

357
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
it's going to have its own operating system

358
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
SteamOS which you can put on any computer

359
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
it's basically a version of Linux

360
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
and then they're going to be selling these computers

361
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
that are basically

362
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
it's kind of to rival consoles a little bit

363
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
to bring PC gaming closer to living room

364
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
but they'll be all these different types

365
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
there's no way they're going to be console prices

366
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Loki's shaking us out over there, no way huh?

367
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
well did you see what the test specs are?

368
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
the test specs are going to have Titans in them

369
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
oh wow

370
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
like the super super super high end

371
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Nvidia cards

372
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I hope I'm one of the lucky 300 people that gets one of those

373
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
exactly, I'm like dude I

374
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I could totally use a new PC and that would be awesome

375
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
just to get like

376
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
something like that

377
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
even the low end was like a

378
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I think like a 680

379
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
that's still way better than I've got now

380
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
nice

381
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
and WhattupG says how about that new controller for the Steam Box

382
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
yes don't forget there is that little controller too

383
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
with the fancy little

384
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
it's really kind of weird, it's got like thumb sticks

385
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
but they're like touch pads

386
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
it's interesting, it's different

387
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
you know it's not the same old same old

388
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
anything with like a million joysticks

389
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
makes me want to hiss and run into a corner

390
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I mean that's one of my main issues with

391
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
one of my continuing issues with Xbox

392
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
remember when Nintendo announced the Wii

393
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
and they came out with that Wiimote

394
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
and a lot of people were like it's really like simple

395
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
and Nintendo was like that's the point

396
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
so many people are intimidated

397
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
by all the buttons like on an Xbox

398
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
or a Playstation controller

399
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
the nice thing about the Wii controller is that

400
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
you know yes there's some smaller buttons

401
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
but for a lot of people there's just one big giant button

402
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
that says A and then the little trigger thing

403
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
and that's why so many senior citizens do the bowling

404
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
and all that you know

405
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
you think they learned from the clusterfuck that was the N64 controller

406
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
which was a good controller

407
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
but still

408
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
exactly

409
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
it gives me horrible horrible flashbacks to

410
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Rebel Alliance N64

411
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
my brother having me help

412
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
hold down all the buttons so he can just

413
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
oh god

414
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
alright well Chell will be talking to you

415
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
about the news and such throughout the show

416
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
please feel free to chime in as you like

417
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
to have your say on whatever's going on

418
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
and those of you in chat rooms

419
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
same thing for you guys live.vognetwork.com

420
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
and Act F says

421
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Loki that's only for the prototypes

422
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Act F says the retail version

423
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
of the Steam Machine will probably offer

424
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
lower specs

425
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
for the prototypes it has the really kickass cards

426
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
of course you do

427
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Daddy I want the golden

428
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Steam Box Daddy

429
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I want it

430
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
what do you mean I can't have it

431
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I want the whole world

432
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
alright

433
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I wanted to do a quick kick off topic here

434
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
and we are running a little behind because of the live stuff

435
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
so I'll just quickly talk about tonight

436
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I know right

437
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
we're only ever here for like 4 hours

438
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
this is going to be a big week in gaming

439
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I don't know if you want us to admit it or not

440
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
because Saturday October 12th

441
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
sees the release of

442
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Pokemon X and Y

443
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
you're not a Pokemon fan

444
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
no

445
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
why not

446
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
because I have other things to like

447
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
like free time

448
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I see

449
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
so you value your time

450
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
so much that you don't want to get sucked into Pokemon

451
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
because you see how Pokemon ruins lives

452
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
yeah thanks Shane

453
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
no no

454
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
the last one I played was Pearl

455
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
and I only ever played it at the gym

456
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
which was ironic because I was going to gyms

457
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
at the gym

458
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
ha ha ha

459
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
and I just

460
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I don't know why that's so funny

461
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
but I'm laughing

462
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
so here's a Pokemon gym

463
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
so you can go to the gym at your gym

464
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
be funny

465
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
because if I were a dude

466
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I could be gym

467
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
ha ha

468
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
oh my god stop

469
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
so

470
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Rob's red

471
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
this is like one of those nights

472
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
where anything's funny

473
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
because there's probably people out there listening

474
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
going Rob it wasn't that funny

475
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
it's not that funny

476
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
alright hater

477
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
why are you hating

478
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
on the Pokemon

479
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
it's not serious I'm into

480
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
and don't get me wrong I understand that there are fans of it

481
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I was just thinking

482
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
that's probably why they have Shane working at a certain company

483
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
because he is the crack dealer

484
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
for getting people into any game

485
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
and they have him behind

486
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Pokemon

487
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I've said this on Horde House

488
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
that Shane was born to do sales

489
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
that's where his ultimate calling

490
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
is going to end up being someday

491
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
stop making this the Shane show

492
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I'm sure he's listening very happy

493
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
that we're talking Pokemon

494
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I don't understand it

495
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
the way I look at a Madden release

496
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
it's like oh cool

497
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
instead of colors this time it's X and Y

498
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
cool

499
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
and that means nothing to me

500
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
other than I assume that there's just going to be a few more

501
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Pokemon

502
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
and you have to collect those

503
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
to add to your ever large collection

504
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
of Pokemon that you battle each other

505
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
for whatever reason

506
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I don't understand

507
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
if you are moving in that direction

508
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I'm kind of disappointed that there is an opportunity

509
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
for a chromosome so you get Pokemon with some

510
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
autosomal disorders

511
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
you've got the down syndrome Pokemon

512
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
that you have to help a little out

513
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
but he's punched for it

514
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
yeah he's pulling for you

515
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
that would have taken gaming into a whole new area

516
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
what about aspie Pokemon

517
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
where they take everything really literal

518
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
and then

519
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
yeah

520
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
and I'm allowed to say that

521
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
so I'm looking at our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com

522
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
and actdeft says

523
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Jim at the gym

524
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Jimception

525
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
alright

526
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
need to go down another level

527
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
let's see

528
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
blackwolf says Loki's not into Pokemon because

529
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
it's not Grand Theft Auto

530
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
well to be fair we had a

531
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
discussion last week where Jamie's like I'm not that

532
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
into Grand Theft Auto and now this week

533
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I'm not that into Pokemon

534
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
and to be fair if they had some sort of mini game in Grand Theft Auto

535
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
where you had to raise dogs and fight them or something

536
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
like Michael Vick of Pokemon

537
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I still probably wouldn't play that

538
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
because that sounds stupid

539
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
I don't know

540
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I'm not into that type of game

541
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
especially if it has to do with

542
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
raising stuff

543
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I blame the 10 dogs for that

544
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
because that made any sort of raising

545
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
of anything extremely boring

546
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
hey cute puppies what's wrong with that

547
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
oh everything because have you raised a dog before

548
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
it's not all

549
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
petting and playing

550
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
frisbee and stuff you have to fucking feed

551
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
that shit, wash it

552
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
you're going to be cleaning poop all day

553
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
they just want attention all goddamn hours of the day

554
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
come to think of it

555
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
right after I quit wow was after the whole

556
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Pokemon mode came out

557
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
so maybe that has something to do with it too

558
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
to Loki's thing

559
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
they put Pokemon in wow

560
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
and I quit

561
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
huh

562
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I thought we all quit because of LFR

563
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
that was the real reason anyway

564
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I liked LFR to be honest

565
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
just because

566
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I could just pew pew stuff

567
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
and as long as I didn't fuck up

568
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
which I never fucked up

569
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I'd get pissed off at other people fucking up

570
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
but then it gave me an excuse to be mad at somebody else

571
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
my one issue with Pokemon

572
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I like Pokemon as a franchise

573
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I respect the games

574
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I understand why people love them

575
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
and I really did love the old anime

576
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
judge me all you want but it was great

577
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
my one thing with Pokemon

578
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
that really got to me was that

579
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
it's kind of a grind fest

580
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
that you have to like and only the ones

581
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
you send into the fight actually get

582
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
XP and it's like oh my gosh

583
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
I gotta grind this and grind this

584
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
and it's like the OCD gamer in me and like

585
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Shane has tried to tell me this like why are you

586
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
leveling up all your Pokemon you only need like

587
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
three of them to be really good to go somewhere

588
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
and I'm like you don't understand how I play

589
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
RPGs

590
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
yeah I totally get that it sets off my OCD

591
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
like woah it's like 100% completion

592
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
and it's in the lyrics

593
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I want to be the very best

594
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
first sentence

595
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
yeah that re-release of the first

596
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
three games when you've got all the new

597
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
areas and you've got the three new islands

598
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
I thought it was never gonna crawl out of my room

599
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I was gonna crawl out of it to die basically

600
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
and not for water or food or anything

601
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
so here's why I'm really excited

602
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
about X and Y is that apparently they're gonna

603
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
have this experience sharing so that now

604
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
you can actually level everything

605
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
that's in your party at once

606
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
new based Pokemon

607
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I am so excited

608
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
so we'll see

609
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
no putting Magikarp into battle first

610
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
and hoping like hell

611
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
but you gotta admit

612
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
once you got Gyarados

613
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
everyone was fucked

614
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
it was worth it

615
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
so worth it

616
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
and I have to say that

617
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Pokemon has offered me comfort over the years

618
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
my Charmander pillow

619
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
was my AX pillow

620
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
and my Togepi was my present

621
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
after I got held up at gunpoint

622
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
oh my gosh

623
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
you know that happened

624
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I found $10 in the parking lot

625
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
and Dan gave me another $10

626
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
and I bought a Togepi

627
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
and I still have my Togepi

628
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I love Togepi so cute

629
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
alright so

630
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
it sounds to me like there's

631
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
half gonna get it and half not gonna

632
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
get Pokemon

633
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
so we'll see

634
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Pokemon is like STDs

635
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
you don't gotta catch them all

636
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
stop

637
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
alright and of course

638
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
there's the mandatory

639
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
actdeft in chat says how about them

640
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
mudkips? shut up

641
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
alright Matt Cube says

642
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
it is popular because it is a simple RPG

643
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
well you know I don't wanna spoil the

644
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
frugal question of the week cause we're gonna get into it

645
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
a little later but I just will say in general

646
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I'm hearing a lot of people that are

647
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
really attached to Pokemon

648
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
and the reason behind it a lot of times

649
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
is that we're from that certain generation

650
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
where like we were like

651
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
13, 15 when these games

652
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
first came out

653
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
and so we've really kinda stuck to it the whole time

654
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
so for many people yeah it kinda was

655
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
the first RPG

656
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
they should totally go the route where

657
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
your Pokemon catch diseases

658
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
where you have to put them down with a shotgun

659
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
they do catch diseases

660
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Pikachu has rabies

661
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
you have to decapitate them to figure it out

662
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
they get like burn and paralyzed

663
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
and all that

664
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
is it a sick burn?

665
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
right. Pikachu you're lame

666
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
burn oh no

667
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
it was very effective

668
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
little mini game where they have burn

669
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
outside of battle and you gotta

670
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
swath them in gauze and take them to the hospital

671
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
and they've got like 5 weeks of recovery

672
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
and then nurse joy won't let you

673
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
have them because you have to be evaluated

674
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
for being a Pokemon crudely

675
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
nurse joy is my favorite

676
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
she's my absolute

677
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
favorite character next to jigglypuff

678
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
and the whole thing is nurse joy

679
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
you know they had like

680
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
I think a new mini series of Pokemon that they're

681
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
putting out yeah they are somebody was just asking me

682
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
in chat about it too oh my god oh my god oh my god

683
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
ok I have to talk about this did you see that gif

684
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
that's going around on tumblr

685
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
of like a Squirtle beating the shit out of a

686
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Charmander and Red's like there with his mouth

687
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000

688
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000

691
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
into his ass and shit is popping out

692
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000

going full on ballistic

696
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
it's hilarious finding a gif on tumblr

697
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000

but I

707
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000

00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000

709
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000

716
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
let's talk about our gaming weeks

717
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
and the types of games that we have been playing

718
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
this week ladies first

719
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
dark sakura what have you been up to this week

720
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
I've been playing some stuff I actually did get on

721
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
final fantasy 14 but I was

722
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
kind of drunk at the time and

723
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
getting really motion sick so I stopped

724
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
and I finally

725
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
beat level 19 on fractal

726
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
I am so freaking happy because

727
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
it was pissing me off so now I'm on like

728
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
23 fractal is

729
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
pretty much video gaming crack

730
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
and thank you rob

731
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
for gifting

732
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
bejeweled 2 to me

733
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
because I

734
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
played the crap load of that but it's still more

735
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
fun on my phone that actually was

736
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
left over from some giveaways we did a long

737
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
time ago we just never

738
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
I mean it's bejeweled 2 it was a long time

739
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
ago so actually popcap gave that to you by

740
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
proxy but I like the the puzzle

741
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
mode in the computer version

742
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000

743
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
and act deft I cannot

744
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
look at videos on my ipad while

00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000

00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000

blame act deft that's it

753
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000

754
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
and I'm sorry that this is radio

755
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
and we're about to watch a video but

756
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
enjoy this audio presentation

757
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
oh my heavens

758
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
that is the most gruesome

759
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
thing I've ever seen

760
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
those are that was

761
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
squirtle taking cream was

762
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
not okay

763
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
a bite out of charmander's neck

764
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
no the audio had to be

765
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
even worse because

766
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
that sounded like

767
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
I don't know that was that was not

768
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
okay that high pitched screaming

769
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
that was that was a little too

770
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
that was a little too visually vague for me

771
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
yeah act

772
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
deft I want you to apologize to the listeners

773
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
right now poor charmander

774
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
at live that is a rabid

775
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
squirtle that squirtle needs

776
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
to be put down oh my god that sound

777
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
was horrible although

778
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
it has settled the age old debate of

779
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
reptiles versus amphibians

780
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
because you know

781
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
turtles and salamanders natural enemies

782
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
so I played other games

783
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
that did involve squirtles biting

784
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
the crap out of charmander's

785
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
and the ahhhh

786
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
ahhhh

787
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000

788
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
sorry I'm so sorry

789
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000

on steam oh what

795
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
I bought bioshock infinite last night

796
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000

797
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000

799
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000

800
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
3 dollars so I picked that up for

801
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
pc so that

802
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
you know I don't have to hurt my

803
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
hand playing it on xbox

804
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
so yeah I've

805
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
I just pretty much oh yeah and of course

806
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
my crack my animal crack

807
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
animal crossing animal cracking

808
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
which just

809
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
to say I'm actually considering busting out

810
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
the gamecube again and

811
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
playing my double

812
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
2 no mori why not because you can

813
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
unlock the nes cartridges

814
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
well yeah well the one that I have

815
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
there were two versions that came out on

816
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
gamecube there was

817
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
double 2 no mori plus which is the one

818
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
I have which was what

819
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
then we got a better one in america after

820
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
that and so that one was re-released in japan

821
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
as e plus well wasn't the original

822
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
original n64

823
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
I was n64 and we never got that

824
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
no however the

825
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
the whole reason I bought the import version

826
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
was to help me practice learning

827
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
reading japanese

828
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
because my

829
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
reading comprehension is not all that

830
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
great I read very

831
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
slowly so it was to help me

832
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
learn to

833
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
read better and so I'm gonna

834
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
be starting with that and I'm also trying to find

835
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
kids books to help me practice reading

836
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
so yeah

837
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
I've been I'm probably gonna be sort of

838
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
doubling up on my animal crossing

839
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
in the next few weeks

840
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000

841
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000

846
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
he's like well wait until blah blah

847
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000

again I'm like you watch and you're

849
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000

850
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000

851
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000

oh you know pretty chill you know

890
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
when I get a free minute

891
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
usually during school months

892
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
I'm kind of a casual gamer

893
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
mostly been getting my pc game on

894
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000

895
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
so there's

896
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
this one indie game coming out

897
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
I've only played the demo so far

898
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
but oh man you know it's

899
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
I think it's made

900
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
an RPG maker something very similar

901
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
it's called Undertale

902
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
and the lead creator is Toby Fox

903
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
man you know give money

904
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
to this developer any way

905
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
you can if he's walking by throw money at his head

906
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
because this was like just the demo

907
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
just blew me away it has all the emotional

908
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
punches of earthbound which I'm pretty partial

909
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
too what'd you say this guy's name was

910
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Toby Fox oh that poor guy

911
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
you know has got to be getting asked what does the

912
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
fox say she is encouraging bags of pennies

913
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
to be flung at his head

914
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
he will thank you through the tears

915
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
cause you know

916
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
he had a kickstarter and you know that

917
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
closed but you know this comes out

918
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
buy it you will thank yourself after you

919
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
stop crying which maybe never

920
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
wait so is like crying laughter

921
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
or crying like this game is really sad

922
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
or crying like they punch you in the emotions

923
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
and not even necessarily sad but it's

924
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
a really beautiful unique game experience

925
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
the whole thing is you're this kid

926
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
lost in this kind of underground place so

927
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
you know earthbound kind of

928
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
so the combat

929
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
is kind of unique the combat system is

930
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
you can choose to spare a monster

931
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
or fight them

932
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
and the whole you know this has been kind of

933
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
done before but it affects how

934
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
people interact with you and

935
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
yeah no it's saying

936
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
what I love about it will

937
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
spoil it that's how much you need to go

938
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
out and like play the demo and yeah

939
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
throw money at him hopefully paper

940
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
that's fair because there's

941
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
like in the beginning

942
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
when I first played Journey and since the game

943
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
has been out for like over a year now I think

944
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
it's fair for me to spoil it especially

945
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
cause I think everybody knows this twist

946
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
I said it was best to go on a journey to not

947
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
know that it's secretly a multiplayer game

948
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
because that so

949
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
enriches the experience cause the twist in Journey is that

950
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
you're not alone on the journey

951
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
and you can't communicate with the other person

952
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
though except through little hums

953
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
and like I can't even

954
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
explain like it's really just something you have to

955
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
experience like the bond you

956
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
start to feel with this little

957
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
thing that

958
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
you know is a real person

959
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
but is it like it's so hard

960
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
to explain I'm like but it was one of those things

961
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
because I didn't know when I played it for the first

962
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
time that that was like the twist in the game

963
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
I was like I want everybody to play Journey

964
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
like that where they find out that twist

965
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
on their own and I think that kind of keeps it

966
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
like all the more shocking

967
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
I'm sorry you just

968
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
the chat room made me think of another game

969
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
I'm playing Mass Effect 3 again

970
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
of course of course you know emotional manipulation

971
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
I'm all for that

972
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
I've also you know I really

973
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
need to pick up the first Darkness but I've also been playing

974
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Darkness 2 cause I'm

975
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
so topical and you know I really

976
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
I'm enjoying the gameplay

977
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
but mostly I'm playing it for Mike Patton's juicy

978
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
juicy voice

979
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
fair enough

980
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
yeah you know I know it's been set up and down

981
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
but no post production the man

982
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
is demonically good

983
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
awesome

984
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
alright well I'm sure

985
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
the indie scene supports

986
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
or loves the fact that you're plugging that

987
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
stuff so yeah by all means

988
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
is there a website that you know off the top of your head?

989
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
well they've got a Tumblr and

990
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
it's just search Undertale

991
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
they should pop up I think they've got an official site

992
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
but so far it's just got the demo

993
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
on it the Tumblr is mostly posting

994
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
fan art right now and updates which are kinda

995
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
sparse and you know

996
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
I'm doing this completely unprompted

997
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
which you know I might appreciate

998
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
a game kicked my way someday

999
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
fair enough

1000
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
not naming any names Toby Fox

1001
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
alright

1002
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
alright well let's move on then

1003
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
if that's everything Chell has for now

1004
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
over to Loki, Loki how was your gaming week?

1005
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
I just played Grand Theft Auto

1006
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
oh Mass Effect

1007
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
there's a shock

1008
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
to be fair I see Tim Tripp

1009
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
in the chat room says oh man I missed

1010
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
the Mass Effect tiers that's kinda what prompted

1011
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Jamie to go down that path she was

1012
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
she was provoked by chat

1013
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
but yeah Grand Theft Auto Online

1014
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
and how's that going? well I heard

1015
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
it had kind of a rough start

1016
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
well yeah like any MMO this

1017
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
they pretty much ironed it out after about three days

1018
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
so it's working

1019
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
so just quickly like I'm sure a lot

1020
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
of people have experienced first hand and done it but

1021
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
what do you do in Grand Theft Auto Online

1022
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
what's the game? well there's an actual

1023
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
storyline that goes along with it so basically

1024
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
your character comes a little Santos after

1025
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Lamar which is Franklin's

1026
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
friend in the single player game

1027
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
he like follows you on Life Invader

1028
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
which is their version of Facebook and

1029
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
so he comes and you come into town and you're

1030
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
doing jobs for different people they have

1031
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
a guy Simeon that you're doing

1032
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
repos for there's

1033
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
some other guys that you're

1034
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
doing like drug stuff for

1035
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
getting you know stealing

1036
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
meth from people and

1037
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
that's just like the missions and then

1038
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
on top of all that you can do the free

1039
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
roaming stuff or you can rob liquor stores

1040
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
you can steal cars

1041
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
you can just

1042
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
shoot people you know one on one do that stuff

1043
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
or there's races, death

1044
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
matches

1045
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
you can do skydiving

1046
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
stuff a whole bunch of

1047
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
different activities in the game

1048
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
and it's up to 16 players

1049
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
and you get randomly thrown in

1050
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
with some people usually

1051
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
and then on top of that you can do these death

1052
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
matches and stuff with other people so

1053
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
a lot of times what I've found is I'm

1054
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
getting dumped in a game I'll go do a mission or something

1055
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
I'll come back and it's not the same people in the same

1056
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
you know world anymore it's like

1057
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
a whole different set of people

1058
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
did you have something to add to that Chell?

1059
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
I was just gonna say

1060
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
kids don't take drugs

1061
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
buy your own

1062
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
don't

1063
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
say that

1064
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
but I've been enjoying it so far and you get to

1065
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
create how your character looks based off of

1066
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
like your ancestry and stuff

1067
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
they have different people

1068
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
that you pick as your grandparents

1069
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
and your parents and then

1070
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
or you pick the grandparents and that alters

1071
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
what the parents look like and then

1072
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
that alters what you look like

1073
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
and I heard and I was reading an email

1074
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
a little bit ahead of the game so I apologize

1075
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
to the emailer I'm gonna spoil a little bit of their email

1076
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
but I heard you can be a woman

1077
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
in Grand Theft Auto Online

1078
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
so that kind of helps the whole like you can never

1079
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
be one but you can in Grand Theft Auto Online

1080
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
yeah well you could

1081
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
in 4 as well you could play a female

1082
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
character in 4 for the online stuff

1083
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
and of course your character is silent

1084
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
so you know it's

1085
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
whatever but yeah it's been a lot of fun

1086
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
I've been enjoying it there's been a few people

1087
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
that I've played with and stuff on there

1088
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
but you know there's the

1089
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
occasional kids

1090
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
that are on there and stuff like I've had

1091
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
a few people try to come kill me and it's great

1092
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
cause you know that they're trying to kill you cause you see

1093
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
them like I'm going to the store to go buy some

1094
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
guns or something like that and I see this

1095
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
guy just like posting up outside

1096
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
and trying to hide and stuff and

1097
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
it's funny cause they try to come in and shoot

1098
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
me but you can't shoot in the store cause

1099
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
when you walk in the store your gun disappears

1100
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
so they have to wait outside the store

1101
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
and so I know they're doing that so

1102
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
immediately when I go out there I switch my gun and

1103
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
I shoot them cause I'm like

1104
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
so you shoot kids is what you're saying here on the show

1105
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
I'm shooting kids playing the game

1106
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Loki is the

1107
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Loki is the enforcement to keep kids out of

1108
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Grand Theft Auto if he sees a child

1109
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
playing Grand Theft Auto he will shoot them

1110
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
but you can you can

1111
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
you can do all sorts of things you can buy property

1112
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
in the game and garages and

1113
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
you can customize your cars and the way you look

1114
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
and it just it's

1115
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
kind of fun it's just this whole leveling up

1116
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
system and stuff and you level up your stats

1117
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
based on what you're doing in the game

1118
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
so

1119
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
I don't know I'm enjoying it I've been playing both on

1120
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
PS3 and 360

1121
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
the PS3 I'm on level 12 cause

1122
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
I've been playing that mostly because my co-workers

1123
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
say oh yeah I get the PS3 version we're gonna

1124
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
be totally on there playing PS3 yeah

1125
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
not a single one of them on PS3

1126
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
so I may go back to 360 again

1127
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
and level up my character there but

1128
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
you know we have the

1129
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
crew it's open we've got our

1130
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
fun little logo there and stuff so

1131
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Rockstar Social Club look for crews look for

1132
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
VoG Network and you can sign up

1133
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
and come play with us I

1134
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
guess there you go all right

1135
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
well moving on to my gaming week I'll

1136
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
go last and honestly there wasn't a lot to

1137
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
it I have really just been playing Final Fantasy

1138
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
14 this entire week just like

1139
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Logan's been playing Grand Theft Auto Online I've

1140
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
pretty much only been playing Final Fantasy 14

1141
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
I'm in the end game now I'm a level 50 white

1142
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
mage and I'm kind of doing the stuff that you do at

1143
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
end game which is running

1144
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
you know CM and AK

1145
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
and Praetorium and all that

1146
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
to get my seal or my

1147
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
I keep saying seals but they're tomes

1148
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
actually and that's really mostly what I've

1149
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
been doing I gotta say though I was really impressed

1150
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
with the ending I'm using my

1151
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
quotey fingers because you know it's an MMO it doesn't really

1152
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
end but Final Fantasy 14 has

1153
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
a pretty definitive

1154
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
story from start to finish and when

1155
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
you finish the actual story you get like

1156
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
this 25 minute ending and I gotta

1157
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
say I was happy with

1158
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
it and it's simple

1159
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
but it's effective like for somebody

1160
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
that's really invested a lot of time in the game

1161
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
I was like I really get the sense

1162
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
that I accomplished something

1163
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
and now I see what's next for my character

1164
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
and that's such a great feeling playing an MMO

1165
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
which usually doesn't

1166
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
ever end

1167
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
so yeah that's really all I can say

1168
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
I can't really talk about a lot of other games I will

1169
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
say I did pick

1170
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
up a new toy the other day I did

1171
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
pick up a new HD

1172
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
game capture card or I should

1173
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
say more like a box it's more a box it's like

1174
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
a USB connected thing and I am really

1175
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
excited because I purposely wanted to get

1176
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
something that would do the new consoles through HDMI

1177
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
and this does the old

1178
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
consoles because the

1179
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
component doubles as a composite

1180
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
plugin so I am really excited

1181
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
to stream a variety

1182
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
of stuff as soon as I can get it working with my

1183
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
laptop and all that so

1184
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
that's something in the future

1185
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
in the coming weeks so I

1186
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
will be able to diversify things

1187
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
a little more than just playing the same MMO all week

1188
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
long I'm going to force myself to do that

1189
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
I've been very busy with personal life

1190
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
stuff Rocky Horror which I'm

1191
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
directing is this coming

1192
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Saturday so as you can imagine I'm

1193
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
super busy with that I wouldn't know anything about playing

1194
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
all games to the exception

1195
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
of all else

1196
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
and how many hours have you spent on Mass Effect?

1197
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
shut up 3 digits or 4 now

1198
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
alright

1199
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
alrighty that's enough

1200
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
for our gaming weeks quickly some

1201
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
housekeeping actually

1202
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
I actually have things for housekeeping tonight

1203
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
I want to plug another podcast I was on today

1204
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
and thank them for having me check out

1205
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
the Let's Wow podcast

1206
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
that is World of Warcraft

1207
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
so yes I still dabble in World of Warcraft even though

1208
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
I've talked about a lot of Final Fantasy 14

1209
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
lately but I did guest on their show tonight

1210
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
that's episode number 31

1211
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
and you can check that out that will be in their archive soon

1212
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
available on iTunes and Stitcher

1213
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
and all that again that's the Let's Wow podcast

1214
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
thank you kids for having me on and we talked about

1215
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
World of Warcraft and other MMOs

1216
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
and I razzed my good buddy

1217
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Gemet for a good 500

1218
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
minutes

1219
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
let's see other things I want to plug

1220
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
it is that time of year again

1221
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
where a lot of podcasts

1222
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
are going to be asking you to vote for them

1223
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
in the podcast awards

1224
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
which is right now kind of what we have

1225
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
in the little podcast industry to recognize

1226
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
the podcast media

1227
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
sometimes

1228
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
I'm a little iffy on how I feel

1229
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
with it all being kind of a popularity

1230
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
contest at the end of the day but

1231
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
I will say being able to

1232
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
be nominated for it and

1233
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
collect the votes and stuff is

1234
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
really good promotion for us

1235
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
and it's always really

1236
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
nice to be able to

1237
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
kind of share in that with other

1238
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
gaming podcasts that really

1239
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
work hard for what they do so I hope we

1240
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
will get that honor again this year

1241
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
to be in the podcast awards but if we

1242
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
aren't we're still going to do what we do

1243
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
here every Sunday night regardless but I

1244
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
would encourage you podcastawards.com

00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000

one of the top two categories and

1251
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
a subcategory, gaming is a subcategory

1252
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
we're also going to urge you to vote for People's Choice

1253
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
for Orange Lounge Radio which kind of

1254
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
makes sense because we're a

1255
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
show about people and community and you guys

1256
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000

if you feel that some other podcast is

1265
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
more deserving of a nomination than us then that's cool

00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000

1270
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
think that's it for housekeeping Twitter

1271
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
twitter.com slash olr and Facebook

1272
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000

1273
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
alright now we can have

1274
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
ourselves some gaming news

1275
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
so Loki let's get on to

1276
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
some gaming news

1277
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
alright so let's talk a little bit about

1278
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
the Xbox One

1279
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
it was

1280
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
I guess put out there this

1281
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
last week that it's going to take

1282
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
about 15 to 20 minutes to download

1283
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
the Xbox One day one patch

1284
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
so expect a short delay before

1285
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
you get into your gaming

1286
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
which if I remember

1287
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
quickly I believe that is a lot

1288
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
less of a wait than

1289
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
you had to for the Wii U

1290
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
wasn't that Wii U

1291
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
day one patch like

1292
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
an hour or something? well that's because

1293
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Nintendo's download servers are slow

1294
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
as hell like I don't know

1295
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
well I think they've gotten a lot better

1296
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
but remember all the crazy Nintendo

1297
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
fanboys were all hammering that thing at the same time

1298
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
I mean not that it excuses it but

1299
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
it's the reason why it was downloading slow

1300
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
alright

1301
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
and then I was going to talk real quick

1302
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
because I actually had noticed this and I posted

1303
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
it on Twitter earlier this week

1304
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
about the

1305
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
next gen digital file

1306
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
sizes holy shit

1307
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
so there's

1308
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
some new SKUs that are coming out for a bunch of

1309
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
different things and I don't know why

1310
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
I guess they're just trying to get people to

1311
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
buy in on this stuff but like NBA2K

1312
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
14 they have a super

1313
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
fan pack and also for

1314
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Call of Duty Ghost they have

1315
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
an Xbox edition

1316
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
and what these two

1317
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
things are is they're digital

1318
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
they're retail items that are digital

1319
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
that you go to the store and buy

1320
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
this packaging and it comes with codes for both the

1321
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Xbox 360 version and the

1322
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Xbox One version or in the case

1323
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
of NBA2K the Xbox

1324
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
360, Xbox One version or

1325
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4 version

1326
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
the fine print though tells you how big

1327
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
those files are like how

1328
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
much hard drive space you need so

1329
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
it's not a big surprise that the current gen stuff

1330
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
is anywhere from 8 to 10 gigs

1331
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
the next gen stuff and this is

1332
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
kind of like you know imagine if they

1333
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
went that way where they were trying to really push digital

1334
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
60 gigabytes

1335
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
60

1336
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
that's a long fucking time

1337
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
to download that I mean that is a good

1338
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
like even on my good internet connection

1339
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
about 15 hours

1340
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
that's a lot of HD stuff

1341
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
and I mean

1342
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
isn't it still out there these caps

1343
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
on bandwidth that people get in a month

1344
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
I think there might be some I think Comcast

1345
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
suspended theirs for a little while and they were going to

1346
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
up it to 300 gigs but still

1347
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
imagine Comcast up their thing to 300 gigs

1348
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
that's like six games in a month

1349
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
which I guess that is a lot but

1350
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
I mean and then nothing else on your internet

1351
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
so let's be real it's still

1352
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
I mean that's a long time to wait for something

1353
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
digitally and yeah I understand that they do

1354
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
have the technology where that they can start

1355
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
streaming the game after a certain

1356
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
amount of it's downloaded but shit

1357
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
even if it's half of it that's still eight hours

1358
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
that you have to wait before you can start playing

1359
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
that game and

1360
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
if that's something that you're planning on buying

1361
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
at launch you know you

1362
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
might as well just buy

1363
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
the disc I mean cause really the

1364
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
cost savings of it isn't very

1365
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
significant cause basically this

1366
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
pack is like 100 bucks if you get the two

1367
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
games so you're really only saving like

1368
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
20 bucks maybe you know

1369
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
the fact that you're basically pre-ordering

1370
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
this you know quite in advance and you have

1371
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
to buy digital copies for both so you can't actually

1372
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
trade them in whereas some of these places

1373
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
I'm sure will allow you to trade in like say your

1374
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
NBA 2K copy on

1375
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
360 get you know maybe 40

1376
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
bucks back or something like that you know

1377
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
it's not that far out and

1378
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
you know buy the next gen version for

1379
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
20 bucks or something I still

1380
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
think it'd be cheaper than having

1381
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
the download all that shit I mean that's just

1382
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
that's ridiculous and especially

1383
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
since they're trying to push that it

1384
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
one of the reasons

1385
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
why the you know their big

1386
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
ideas of making this all digital world is just

1387
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
not feasible right now with

1388
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
our internet infrastructure

1389
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
it's just not gonna work

1390
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
so that's it

1391
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
well what do you think though if the console life cycle

1392
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
is like 10 years or whatever do you

1393
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
think that maybe in that amount of time

1394
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
we will be at that point?

1395
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Possibly I mean it's gonna take some sort of

1396
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
I think government funding

1397
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
to kind of

1398
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
put you know

1399
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
I guess get these companies

1400
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
to want to improve their infrastructure

1401
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
cause right now a lot of these companies have

1402
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
monopolies in the different areas and so

1403
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
there's really no

1404
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
no need for them to try to get their

1405
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
internet speeds faster just like you know with

1406
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Comcast I was trying to get this one plan

1407
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
that they had that was 70 bucks

1408
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
cause I pay about 60, 70 dollars

1409
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
right now for just internet it's in a

1410
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
different area where it's double the internet speed that

1411
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
I have now plus cable

1412
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
for the same price and

1413
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
of course

1414
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
oh I'm sorry that plan's not in our area

1415
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
of course

1416
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
it's just that's the problem

1417
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
there's monopolies everywhere so you're not gonna

1418
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
they're not gonna be in a big hurry to

1419
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
offer faster internet

1420
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
without some sort of government funding because

1421
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
why bother spending the money

1422
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
to upgrade our service when we can just charge more

1423
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
and you know keep the same level

1424
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
of service or decline it

1425
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
alright well one thing people

1426
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
were using their bandwidth for this week was

1427
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
to watch the latest Nintendo Direct

1428
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
you know Nintendo likes to do these where

1429
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
they just take the news they take their case straight to

1430
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
their hardcore fan base and

1431
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
it's been working for better or worse for them

1432
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
they unveiled the latest

1433
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
Nintendo Direct on October 1st which kind

1434
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
of ran down here's where Nintendo's at for the

1435
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
end of the year one big

1436
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
shocker maybe not I don't know

1437
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
depending on what you think of these things there was

1438
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
a delay Donkey Kong Country Tropical

1439
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
Freeze moving to

1440
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
2014 it will not make the holiday

1441
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
season this was one of their big holiday

1442
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
things they were hyping but unfortunately

1443
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Donkey Kong Country did move

1444
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
to February 2014 is

1445
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
when this game is coming out

1446
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
I'm gonna go out on a limb

1447
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
and say that this is strategy

1448
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
that I don't know if this was necessarily

1449
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
because the game's not done

1450
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
but this was maybe to buff up

1451
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
2014

1452
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
next or this coming winter

1453
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
where things didn't work out

1454
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
so well in 2013 I think you're right

1455
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
because they had too much stuff coming out and

1456
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
there's the fourth quarter there's too much stuff coming out

1457
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Nintendo themselves they have We Fit

1458
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
You in the beginning of November

1459
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
and then they have Super Mario 3D

1460
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
World coming out at the end of November

1461
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
and this was originally gonna be like

1462
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
a couple weeks later in the early part

1463
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
of December right and I think

1464
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
this could also mean and I'm definitely

1465
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
tinfoil hatting here a bit so don't you know

1466
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
take what I say with a grain of salt here but

1467
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
this could mean that Mario Kart 8 is

1468
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
bumped back a little bit because what Mario Kart 8

1469
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
they had said March before right?

1470
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
I'm thinking

1471
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
I'm thinking more like April at this

1472
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
point and maybe there's something happening there

1473
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
where they want to strategically spread

1474
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
out the first party releases plus

1475
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
I don't think there are a lot of releases

1476
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
on the Wii U right now we're running

1477
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
in the same situation we did last year

1478
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
where there was nothing coming out for a few months

1479
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
and I think that's what we're gonna see now

1480
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
I definitely know there's nothing

1481
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
coming out in December and there's nothing

1482
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
coming out right now in

1483
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
January. Well how does Xbox One and PlayStation

1484
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
4 look for next year in the winter?

1485
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
I mean aren't they gonna be the ones that are kinda

1486
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
hurting for games in the winter? I think that

1487
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
they're gonna run I think everyone's gonna run in the same

1488
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
situation but right now we don't have a firm

1489
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
lineup for what we have for you know

1490
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
the first quarter of the year

1491
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
so it's still

1492
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
they haven't really announced that stuff you know probably

1493
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
later on into

1494
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
the fourth quarter we'll know that because

1495
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
you know right now their focus is on the

1496
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
fourth quarter so I don't think anything's gonna

1497
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
get delayed to the you know

1498
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
beginning part of the year but they still haven't made their announcements

1499
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
of what titles they have coming like you know

1500
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
EA hasn't announced what they really have coming aside

1501
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
from you know

1502
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
was it

1503
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
yeah but EA's not a factor on Wii U either

1504
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
true yeah very true

1505
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
unfortunately

1506
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
I know but even like other companies like there's

1507
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
just no big titles have been announced

1508
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
yeah at least not a lot of titles for

1509
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
February well what up G says Titanfall

1510
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
is next spring right I guess that's a big one

1511
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
I think that's more summer I don't think that's

1512
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
coming out in spring at all you think Destiny's gonna be that

1513
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
same time frame too I know that's a big one I think Destiny's yeah

1514
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
maybe fourth quarter that it's

1515
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
second half of the or at least second quarter I think

1516
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
fair enough going to our chat room at

1517
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
live.vognetwork.com

1518
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
SHJ100Matt says further proves that their whole

1519
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
E3 conference video just showed

1520
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
2014 games

1521
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
CaptainSpike says absolutely gutted

1522
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
about Donkey Kong one of my most anticipated

1523
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
games of 2013

1524
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
well at least you're

1525
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
still getting a solid platformer in the form

1526
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
of Super Mario 3D World which

1527
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
some of the early previews are coming back very

1528
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
positive which is no surprise at all

1529
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
I mean you know a lot of the Mario

1530
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
games are very strong performers I can't

1531
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
think I what was the last one that people

1532
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
didn't like Sunshine

1533
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
that was a while ago Hotel Mario

1534
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
what's that Hotel Mario

1535
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
Hotel that's a long time ago hey Sunshine was fun

1536
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
yeah Sunshine still has its

1537
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
defenders I like Sunshine actually

1538
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
myself so

1539
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
I mean most Mario platformers aren't bad

1540
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
they just aren't I mean there's been some

1541
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
that are like that's okay but

1542
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
some most of them are very very good

1543
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
so

1544
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
that's at least you got a solid

1545
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
platformer in that to look forward to

1546
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
in November now in Japan and Europe

1547
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
Sonic will be

1548
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
coming to Super Smash Brothers

1549
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
whatever they call it which well

1550
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
I was I see you rolling your eyes over there Loki

1551
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
I was actually a little surprised because of the fact

1552
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
it's a third party character I didn't think they'd

1553
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
recycle those but I guess

1554
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
cause Nintendo's not publishing

1555
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Mario and Sonic at the Olympics

1556
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
I guess

1557
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
this is not surprising at all

1558
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
that's about surprising oh hey Luigi's in this

1559
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
game oh alright

1560
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
fair enough more surprising they said he wasn't in the game

1561
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
next up character

1562
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
Scarlet Witch

1563
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
let's hope

1564
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
let's see and

1565
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
Pikmin 3 is getting DLC

1566
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
Nintendo's kind of further going down

1567
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
the DLC spiral with

1568
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
Pikmin 3 DLC but a lot of people looking

1569
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
forward to it and you know I gotta say the Super

1570
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
Luigi U was

1571
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
pretty good so I mean if Nintendo

1572
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
can keep making robust DLC packages

1573
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
like that this isn't a bad thing at all

1574
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
also some folks very excited

1575
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
I'm sure Act Deft was screaming

1576
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
shaking crying and convulsing

1577
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
over the fact that there is a new Kirby

1578
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
game on its way to the 3DS

1579
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
as if the 3DS

1580
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
needed more powerhouse games but here's

1581
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
another one Kirby's on its way

1582
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
and Loki's going yup yup that's what I was

1583
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
saying like you know all these announcements like wow

1584
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
more great titles for the 3DS and then like

1585
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
but when people are like Nintendo's

1586
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
dying Nintendo's gonna go under

1587
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
it's like the 3DS

1588
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
is like

1589
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
da bomb right now like you can't

1590
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
I mean yes the 3DS in the

1591
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
beginning little shaky but now

1592
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
you've got it like if you play

1593
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
handheld games at all the 3DS

1594
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
we've already established on the 3DS

1595
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
for 3D anymore and now we have two

1596
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
screens one that's HD one that's a touch

1597
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
screen just fucking put it on the Wii U

1598
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
already god dammit it's gonna happen

1599
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
eventually it's just

1600
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
make that announcement and then done then you don't have to worry

1601
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
about content because you have a ton of fucking

1602
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
games already on the 3DS

1603
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
that could be on the Wii U

1604
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
alright I don't understand it a game I am

1605
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
very excited about also on the 3DS

1606
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
speaking of powerhouse games I can't think of

1607
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
anything for me more a powerhouse than

1608
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Zelda A Link Between Worlds

1609
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
which is coming out November 22nd

1610
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
this is the spiritual successor of

1611
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
sorts to Link to the Past from Super

1612
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
Nintendo which holds a place near and dear

1613
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
in my heart and I'm sure many of you out there

1614
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
one thing they announced about the game that's

1615
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
very interesting the dungeons can be played

1616
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
in any order

1617
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
which is not common

1618
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
for the Zelda games usually without

1619
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
certain items you can't get to places but like

1620
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
in the early like the first Zelda

1621
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
game you could run into level

1622
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
you know some of the later levels

1623
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
if you had a bomb you could probably go all the way

1624
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
to level 9 right at the beginning right

1625
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
you might need a ladder some of us have made the mistake

1626
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
of doing that the first time we found it by accident

1627
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
and went what the hell dead

1628
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
so I would imagine there's

1629
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
still gonna be an optimal order just like

1630
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
in any Mega Man game or something but

1631
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
the cool thing is it'll kinda open it up

1632
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
for the speed runners and people

1633
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
that like to bend the rules a little bit to

1634
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
try different patterns so that'll be pretty cool

1635
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
yeah I'm just looking forward to it

1636
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
you know being just a smash hit and

1637
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
quieting the people who will not

1638
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
shut up about Ocarina

1639
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
of Time slash Majora's Mask

1640
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
look guys we all love those games

1641
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
they're not the only Zelda games come on

1642
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
thank you will you give me a

1643
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
fist bump for that statement thank you very much

1644
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
thank you like I you know

1645
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
I understand those games Ocarina

1646
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
and they have their place but

1647
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
for me Link to the Past oh my gosh

1648
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
I give a clump just thinking about how great that

1649
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
game is I've got a gold cart

1650
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
Ocarina of Time I agree with you

1651
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
fair enough

1652
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
alright I knew I liked having you on the show

1653
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
alright so that is out of course

1654
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
November 22nd and lastly I'll mention this

1655
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
the 3DS StreetPass system

1656
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
the relay points

1657
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
that they instituted recently like at Starbucks

1658
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
where you can actually street pass people

1659
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
at Starbucks because what happens is that

1660
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
when you go there

1661
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
whoever was last there their data is

1662
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
on the little machine waiting for you

1663
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
to get it on your 3DS well they're gonna

1664
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
upgrade these relay points six

1665
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
people now will be on these

1666
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
things so if you go to Starbucks you can get up to six

1667
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
people on these things that's even better

1668
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
because I mean I actually do go to the

1669
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
like there's this one that Becky and I

1670
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
go to like at least twice a week

1671
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
yeah I know that's great that's awesome news

1672
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
and some content distribution

1673
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
events are planned for use

1674
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
over the relay so

1675
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
interesting

1676
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
very cool stuff I guess it'll push demos

1677
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
through to your 3DS if you opt in for it

1678
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
so that'll be really cool

1679
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
Dark Soccer I think you have more Nintendo

1680
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
stuff for us right? But I'm putting my

1681
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
island up yes I do have other news

1682
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
thank you ActDeft because I've

1683
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
really been wanting an island for a while

1684
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
well how about

1685
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
the new Wii U

1686
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
firmware is also going to have a bunch

1687
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
of other features now it's gonna be

1688
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
700 megabytes so

1689
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
it's gonna take a while to download

1690
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
but it has internet browser

1691
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
updates it has

1692
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
more demos and trial

1693
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
software USB keyboard support

1694
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
Dolby Pro Logic 2

1695
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
smartphones will be able

1696
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
to connect to the

1697
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
Nintendo network ID

1698
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
you can view a friends list from the Wii U menu

1699
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
you have your headset

1700
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
that can hook to the gamepad and be used

1701
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
for chat and you can read

1702
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
PDF files on the Wii U

1703
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
and you can also save your passwords

1704
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
for websites so

1705
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
lots of stuff

1706
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
you also have to accept a new license agreement

1707
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
I'm telling you this because I just updated

1708
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
my Wii U not that long ago

1709
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
I also want to put this PSA out there

1710
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
those Wii U updates can take a little while

1711
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
especially because it was what like 700 megabytes

1712
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
that's what I was saying

1713
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
so put on a movie

1714
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
call your mom

1715
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
my point is don't wait until

1716
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
the day Mario 3D

1717
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
comes out to do this

1718
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
like if you're listening to my voice

1719
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
and you haven't done this yet you probably just want to go turn

1720
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
that guy on right now and just let the update be over

1721
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
and done with and then be ready for

1722
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
Zelda Wind Waker HD or whatever the next game

1723
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
is you're going to get

1724
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
or get up in the morning have an update and call your mom

1725
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
or whichever relative

1726
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
you have living right now

1727
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
fair enough, fair enough

1728
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
talk to them

1729
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
and go outside and get some fresh air

1730
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
get a job, wait I need to get a job

1731
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
alright Loki

1732
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
alright

1733
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
so let's see here let's talk a little bit about

1734
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
PlayStation 3 getting its own

1735
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
firmware update as well

1736
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
4.5 finally came out

1737
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
and what it does is adds the

1738
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
auto downloads

1739
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
to people that are not in

1740
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
PlayStation Plus so you'll be able to

1741
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
also transfer data between your

1742
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
PlayStation 3 and Vita versus

1743
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
via Wi-Fi

1744
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
and ethernet connections I guess

1745
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
originally you could only do it through the transfer cable that they had

1746
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
and

1747
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
also lets you

1748
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
set up I guess groups

1749
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
of players that can

1750
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
see your trophies so you can

1751
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
either have that open to everybody I don't know why you wouldn't

1752
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
why you would hide your trophies from

1753
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
people unless there was like a trophy

1754
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
for going to the strip club a lot of times

1755
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
and Grand Theft Auto 5 or something you know I don't

1756
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
know well

1757
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
remember when I was getting

1758
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
all those achievements in Dance Dance Revolution

1759
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
Universe because I had it like the day it came out

1760
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
and I started playing it right away and I got a

1761
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
message from what was his name

1762
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
that guy who had all the achievements

1763
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
he ended up getting banned from Xbox

1764
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
because it turns out they were a strip club DJ

1765
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
that was his name he sent me a message like

1766
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
how are getting the achievements in that game

1767
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
what's the difficulty like

1768
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
like I don't even know how he found me I think he used one of

1769
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
those like websites that shows you like

1770
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
who's doing well in achievements and I think

1771
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
at that moment in time I had more

1772
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
achievement points in that game than anyone else

1773
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
I mean like on release day so

1774
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
maybe if I'm in that situation

1775
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
and again I want to hide trophies

1776
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
oh it just occurred to me

1777
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
if I'm reviewing games

1778
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
people might ask me to turn that feature on

1779
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
to not spoil because a lot of the trophy lists

1780
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
leak from review copies

1781
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
so maybe that's to encourage

1782
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
critics and so forth to not leak it

1783
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
I bet that would be one

1784
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
anyways they have it

1785
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
so

1786
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
cool but yeah so basically

1787
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
so the auto download is kind of cool

1788
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
about time everybody gets that

1789
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
here's the thing okay and this isn't really a playstation

1790
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
but like you know speaking of

1791
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
system updates and stuff fucking 360

1792
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
man every time I log in live

1793
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
now I'm still getting that fucking prompt

1794
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
to add a second like

1795
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
a second method to confirm my passwords

1796
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
or stuff if I need to

1797
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
you know like a second way they can contact

1798
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
me basically and I've filled it out

1799
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
a bunch of times

1800
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
and I've even filled it out either via

1801
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
you know texting via email

1802
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
and it still fucking says oh

1803
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
sorry you only have one form to

1804
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
contact you are you okay with this

1805
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
I'm like yes I'm okay with this nope sorry

1806
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
you need to please add another

1807
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
way to contact us that's weird and I even did it through

1808
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
the website they have a special website you go

1809
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
to to confirm that because obviously it says

1810
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
oh yeah you can go ahead and

1811
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
add it through this oh I'm sorry actually no you can't

1812
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
add it through this you have to go onto this

1813
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
website to do it and I did that and

1814
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
it confirmed it and it still

1815
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
fucking doesn't work and I get prompted every

1816
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
fucking time I log in you need to call Microsoft or something

1817
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
it's not like something's wrong fucking flip

1818
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
them off is what I need to do aren't

1819
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
you kind of doing that right now

1820
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
because Microsoft executives

1821
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
right now and their tech supporter

1822
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000

1825
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000

01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000

1831
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
alright

1832
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
speaking of like consoles

1833
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
and things one console will be going

1834
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
away rest in peace

1835
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
bye it's

1836
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
Nintendo's Wii believe it or not Nintendo's

1837
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
Wii will be ending production

1838
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
soon in Japan

1839
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
so we don't have any

1840
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
worry about you know the US or other

1841
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
territories Canada Europe we don't know but

1842
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
in Japan let's be

1843
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
real the Wii isn't selling so hot anymore

1844
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
985

1845
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
Wii units were sold in a week which

1846
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
really isn't a lot so the Wii is going

1847
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
to be fading to black and

1848
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
it kind of makes sense for Nintendo like

1849
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
you know push the Wii U make people buy

1850
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
that to play the games make

1851
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
sense for them so yep they'll be

1852
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
sunsetting the Wii and I

1853
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
I wouldn't I would bet that maybe

1854
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
trying to push the Wii U a little harder

1855
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
especially in a year where

1856
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
in Japan there's no competition

1857
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
isn't exactly a bad

1858
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
move so

1859
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
nice knowing you Wii

1860
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
good not to have yourself as competition

1861
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
right because well in a way

1862
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
that's what Nintendo would have right now in Japan

1863
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
if you think about it in terms of production

1864
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
cost making a machine that no one's buying

1865
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
then yeah

1866
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
there's no need to keep putting the production

1867
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
money into it when you could be

1868
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
using it for Wii U I mean what is going to be

1869
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
on the shelves in Japan there's Wii U

1870
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
now there's not a Wii there's 360

1871
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
but in Japan that's not

1872
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
a factor sorry and the PlayStation 3

1873
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
you know so it's literally gonna be

1874
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
do you want the new system or the old system

1875
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
that's the way it is in Japan right now

1876
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
it'll be interesting

1877
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
so of course handhelds

1878
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
it's a whole nother Oprah because they

1879
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
are making a push with the Vita in Japan

1880
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
big time we talked about that already last week

1881
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
alright one more story and then we'll travel

1882
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
around the world and check out release dates Stark Sakura

1883
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000

1887
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
something that how long have you had some of my

1888
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
games

1889
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
what you mean

1890
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
that I've actually played

1891
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
I'm just gonna be

1892
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
playing games okay

1893
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
so well this should interest

1894
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
you you like SimCity

1895
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
don't you I like the old SimCity

1896
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
I like the first SimCity game

1897
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
I like SimCity action news on the

1898
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
CD-ROM remember that do I have

1899
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
to go get those YouTubes because I will

1900
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
ah there's a big mine

1901
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
no

1902
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
they should make me a voice actor

1903
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
well Maxis is

1904
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
considering an offline mode for SimCity

1905
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
the note

1906
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
was put on the state of SimCity

1907
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
blog where the Emeryville

1908
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
manager Patrick Beutcher

1909
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
I guess is saying

1910
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
that they are considering

1911
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
an offline mode apparently since a lot

1912
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
of people yes

1913
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
Alan I will check out your Saturn

1914
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
um since

1915
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
a lot of people have been complaining

1916
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
that it is specifically on

1917
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
the quote says right now we

1918
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
have a team specifically focused on

1919
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
exploring the possibility of an offline mode

1920
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
I can't make any promises on when we

1921
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
will have more information but we know this is

1922
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
something that many of our players have been asking for

1923
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
so

1924
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
who knows maybe it'll be sooner rather than

1925
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
later I'm interested

1926
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
I don't have the game

1927
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
yet but I'm interested in offline mode

1928
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
here's my concern because

1929
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
SimCity is starting to come down in price a little bit

1930
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
I have a feeling that

1931
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
they'll do it as part of an expansion

1932
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
or something to get you to spend the full 60

1933
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
bucks which

1934
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
I mean whatever I would consider

1935
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
still spending it on an offline SimCity

1936
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
that doesn't require Origin

1937
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
but we'll see

1938
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
yeah

1939
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
well I honestly

1940
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
and just on the same note

1941
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
I wish that there would be

1942
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
updates across the board for all of them so you don't

1943
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
have to use Origin but that's me

1944
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
and everybody else that plays

1945
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
Mass Effect 3

1946
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
alright traveling around the world

1947
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
and checking out some release dates things that

1948
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
will be coming a little sooner than

1949
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000

if the 3D will blow your mind

2007
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
the 2D will just kind of simmer your mind

2008
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
I am hearing, take it with a grain of salt

2009
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
but I am hearing that the 2DS

2010
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
a lot of people kind of like the way it feels

2011
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
when they play it for what it's worth

2012
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
I mean despite the fact that

2013
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
a lot of people have been very critical about the design

2014
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
how it doesn't fold the same way and so forth

2015
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
hearing a lot of positive feedback about

2016
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
how it feels when it's in your hands

2017
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
I'd like to mention though

2018
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
even though I do happen to peruse

2019
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
the Evil G website for some release dates

2020
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
sometimes I am kind of

2021
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
confused at why they're selling

2022
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
GoPro accessories for

2023
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
Gamestop

2024
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
I don't know

2025
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
I don't know

2026
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
Moving on to Japan and checking out

2027
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
the releases over there on the Playstation 3

2028
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
on October 10th

2029
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
the Batman Arkham Twin Pack which came out here

2030
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
just last week I think

2031
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
comes out in Japan

2032
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
it's called the best series

2033
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
also coming out in Japan on the 10th

2034
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
F1 2013

2035
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
Grand Theft Auto 5's Japanese release

2036
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
Mina no Golf 6

2037
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
gets a best release

2038
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
a price reduction

2039
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
Sakatsuku Pro Soccer Club

2040
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
comes out from Sega

2041
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
and Tales of Symphonia

2042
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
the Unisonant pack comes out

2043
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
there's like a regular

2044
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
there's a Famitsu Deluxe pack

2045
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
and there's a Lalabit Market

2046
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
limited edition pack

2047
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
so there's all that if you're Tales of Symphonia

2048
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
looking forward to that

2049
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
also worth mentioning a game called Fairy Fencer F

2050
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
comes out from Compile

2051
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
in a regular and limited edition

2052
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
Fairy Fencer

2053
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
is that like fencing?

2054
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
you put them on a spike

2055
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
and then you fence

2056
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
each other with dead fairies

2057
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
that would be awesome

2058
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
they're not Navi fairies

2059
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
they're like

2060
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
they're like carrying

2061
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
pole arms

2062
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
she's fighting a grizzly bear

2063
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
and yes of course she's wearing a short skirt

2064
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
and you can pretty much

2065
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
see her hoo-ha hanging out

2066
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
by fairies do you mean Vocaloids?

2067
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
because that's what they look more like

2068
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
I think it might be I'm not sure

2069
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
but Fairy Fencing

2070
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
they're fencing your face off

2071
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
basically if you're that grizzly bear

2072
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
I'm a fenced

2073
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
alright

2074
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
let's see what's coming out on other systems in Japan

2075
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
this week

2076
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
moving on over to the Xbox 360

2077
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
ha ha I know but there are still things

2078
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
coming out including Grand Theft Auto 5

2079
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
F1 2013

2080
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
the Batman Arkham pack

2081
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
and there's an Xbox Live 12 month

2082
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
2 gold membership card that comes with

2083
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
Grand Theft Auto 5

2084
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
I don't really know what that means but that is something that is happening in Japan

2085
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
they probably had something similar here

2086
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
I just missed it

2087
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
on the Playstation Vita this week Dream Club Zero Portable

2088
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
gets a price reduction

2089
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
a new game called Getsuigakuen

2090
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
cool comes out this week

2091
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
wait wait what?

2092
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
Getsuigakuen Co

2093
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
comes out this week

2094
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
can I see what that looks like?

2095
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
you sure can

2096
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
this is the one screenshot I have

2097
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
unless this other

2098
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
let me check out this other page

2099
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
might have more

2100
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
fantastic radio here we have

2101
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
that just shows what it comes with

2102
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
I want to see what the limited edition comes with

2103
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
I thought I've heard of it before

2104
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
but I don't remember off hand

2105
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
aha it looks like they get the game

2106
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
a book, maybe a school book

2107
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
a music CD

2108
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
and trading cards?

2109
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
that's a drama CD

2110
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
no

2111
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
the CD is

2112
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
basically like a play

2113
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
like radio drama

2114
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
so maybe this is based off some type of

2115
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
drama series

2116
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
alright also on the Playstation Vita

2117
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
Metal Gear Solid HD edition

2118
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
getting a price reduction

2119
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
and I think some new Vita

2120
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
equipment comes out this week

2121
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
is this the week of the Vita Slim model?

2122
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
it is, so this is the week where

2123
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
your black, khaki black, light blue white

2124
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
lime green white, pink black

2125
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
white and black slim models

2126
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
all come out, so no wonder

2127
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
there's so much on the Vita this week

2128
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
oh my gosh there's Slaughter Mania 5

2129
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
like slaughter, like slot machines

2130
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
not like I'm gonna go kill a bunch of zombies

2131
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
Slaughter Mania

2132
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
Uncharted Golden Abyss gets a re-release

2133
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
in the best hits

2134
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
Soul Sacrifice gets a re-release

2135
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
and then Sakatsuku Pro Soccer Club

2136
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
Osukuru

2137
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
comes out this week also

2138
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
so lots of stuff going on on the Vita this week

2139
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
now that makes sense

2140
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
now that I see that the

2141
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
Vita Slim is out this week

2142
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
so I'm sure there will be some people here for that

2143
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
on the Wii U, sadly nothing to report this week

2144
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
but Rayman Legends coming up next week

2145
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
you got a little time

2146
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
and on the Nintendo 3DS this week

2147
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
Pokemon X and Y is also

2148
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
on Japan, it's like a worldwide release

2149
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
also a big release for them

2150
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
on the 12th and

2151
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
there's all sorts of accessories

2152
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
you can get

2153
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
Froki pens

2154
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
you can get

2155
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
Chesapeake pouches

2156
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
and

2157
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
Lord knows what else, there you go

2158
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
all that coming out in Japan

2159
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
this week on the 3DS

2160
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
Dark Sakura?

2161
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
Well we have a pretty

2162
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
slender selection for the UK

2163
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
on the 9th there's Montague's Mount

2164
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
for PC

2165
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
and

2166
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
on the 11th we have

2167
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
Beyond 2 Souls for PS3

2168
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
that's about it

2169
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
alright just a couple more news stories for you guys

2170
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
and then the classic game of the week

2171
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
and it will surprise no one

2172
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
Loki?

2173
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
alright

2174
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
so let's see here

2175
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
SNK

2176
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
they are getting rid of

2177
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
the Neo Geo X, you may remember

2178
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
the Neo Geo X is kind of that

2179
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
rebuild I guess of the

2180
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
classic Neo Geo

2181
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
they also had this

2182
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
portable system that was

2183
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
plugged into this dock

2184
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
it was kind of emulating everything

2185
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
but

2186
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
now they have cease and desist

2187
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
against the website that sells the Neo Geo X

2188
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
I guess they were saying

2189
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
that the notice which

2190
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
appeared on October 2nd

2191
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
demands an immediate cease and desist

2192
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
of manufacturing, distribution, promotion

2193
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
and selling of the Neo Geo X

2194
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
gold limited edition mega pack

2195
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
volume 1 and classic volumes 1 through 5

2196
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
as well as the Neo Geo X

2197
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
arcade stick in order to

2198
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
protect our intellectual property rights

2199
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
such as Neo Geo and SNK

2200
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
see here I thought

2201
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
me being naive I guess that

2202
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
they had the go ahead to go ahead and make that stuff

2203
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
since they had SNK on it

2204
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
and it was a fucking Neo Geo

2205
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
I mean at least it looked like one

2206
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
come to find out they didn't

2207
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
they just kind of put it out there anyways

2208
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
wow, it's been out for a while too

2209
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
I was going to say I forgot the thing even came out

2210
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
how horrible is that

2211
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
but I mean they've recycled those Neo Geo games

2212
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
like a ton of them are available on

2213
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
Virtual Console and Playstation 3

2214
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
download I mean

2215
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
if you want something a little more authentic

2216
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
I guess you could get this but

2217
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
keep in mind those licensed ones

2218
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
SNK gets money for

2219
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
true, they would get no money

2220
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
if they didn't

2221
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
provide their license

2222
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
ok, here's what it is, I get it now

2223
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
I guess it was licensed

2224
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
because Tomo was the one that was putting it out

2225
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
they do a lot of license, weird shit

2226
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
but now they're ending

2227
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
their license agreement so

2228
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
it's no longer going to be sold after the 2nd

2229
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
wow, the 2nd of October?

2230
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
well then it's done

2231
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
it's done, yes, so

2232
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
kind of makes me wonder

2233
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
it sounds very like

2234
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
not like we've decided

2235
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
to, you know, end our

2236
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
licensing agreement with Tomo, we're just not going to

2237
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
produce anymore, it's like please be informed that

2238
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
our company is

2239
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
or the licensing agreement is

2240
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
terminated as of October 2nd

2241
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
so what happens to all these unsold consoles

2242
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
they go in a landfill in New Mexico?

2243
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
no, they still get sold, they just can't produce anymore

2244
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
oh, well that's good

2245
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
go get them now

2246
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
if they're sitting on some then yeah

2247
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
I don't think they can sell them

2248
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
they don't have an agreement to do so anymore

2249
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
if there's some out there in a while

2250
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
there's something they can do about that

2251
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
this will be a collector's item very soon

2252
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
no company for ET down there

2253
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
I'll still

2254
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
stick with my Neo Geo

2255
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
you got the real thing though, why even bother

2256
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
with this stuff if you have the real thing

2257
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
because it has the games loaded on the system

2258
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
you know how much I paid for the last cartridge

2259
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
I bought?

2260
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
we paid $300 for

2261
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
what was the last one we got?

2262
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
King of Fighters 2000

2263
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
when I had money

2264
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
blows me away how much those cartridges cost

2265
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
the 48 in 1's

2266
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
there's a ton of them on one cartridge

2267
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
Bobby knows

2268
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
alright

2269
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
one more story about Terraria

2270
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
which is a hardcore fan

2271
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
I saw Terraria on

2272
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
Playstation 3 this weekend

2273
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
I was at Fry's randomly when I got the

2274
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
capture box

2275
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
and I didn't realize because it comes with

2276
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
all that extra stuff, it has a neat little box

2277
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
that it comes in with the drive and everything

2278
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
so I was kind of looking at that going

2279
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
oh neat

2280
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
I personally way preferred Minecraft

2281
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
to Terraria but I know Terraria

2282
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
definitely has its fans, people love the

2283
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
retroness and the 2D that Terraria has

2284
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
and so the good news is Terraria 2

2285
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
it's a thing that's happening

2286
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
Andrew Spinks the creator of Terraria

2287
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
talked about Terraria 2

2288
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
saying it is definitely something

2289
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
that will be happening but contrary

2290
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
to several of the articles that went live today

2291
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
I have not started development

2292
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
I have a list of features and mechanics

2293
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
I want the game to have but that is the

2294
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
extent of the development at this point

2295
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
so in other words, he's going to do it

2296
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
it's announced in that regard

2297
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
but that's it, we don't have anything else

2298
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
so don't plan on this happening anytime

2299
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
soon

2300
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
let's see, also in the interview

2301
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
mentioned that version 1.2

2302
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
will be the last

2303
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
7 month update for the original game

2304
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
but that he will change the end game

2305
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
up for the update within the next month

2306
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
or two because there was no final

2307
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
boss and there may be some other

2308
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
smaller updates a few more months down the line

2309
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
he might hire a team to

2310
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
do some updates but he'll be

2311
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
focusing on Terraria 2 soon

2312
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
so there you go

2313
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
Darkstalker, you played a little bit of Terraria right?

2314
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
Yeah, you gave me a copy

2315
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
Yeah, I remember that, I bought like a 4 pack

2316
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
It was interesting

2317
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
I don't think I could quite get into it very well

2318
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
but it was interesting, it amused

2319
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
It amused me for an hour

2320
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
Thank you for amusing me for an hour, Rob

2321
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
You're welcome

2322
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
Alright, well let's talk about a game that has amused Darkstalker

2323
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
for a hell of a lot longer than an hour

2324
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
and it amused her earlier today

2325
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
when she picked it

2326
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
as the classic game of the week

2327
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
because every week Darkstalker dives into the gaming vault

2328
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
and pulls out a game 10 years or older

2329
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
and says

2330
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
Hey!

2331
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
Respect this game and play it now

2332
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
Dust it off

2333
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
Darkstalker, you better play bitch

2334
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
You better play

2335
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
Darkstalker

2336
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
What is the classic game of the week?

2337
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
The game is

2338
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
Animal Crossing

2339
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
AKA Dobutsu no Mori

2340
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
Animal Forest

2341
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
It is a life sim game

2342
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
and I miss this music, Rob

2343
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
The old school music

2344
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
Wasn't it good?

2345
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
It was good

2346
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
I was actually running around the house

2347
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
making up lyrics to this to Midna

2348
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
because she was looking at me like I was insane

2349
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
She probably does that a lot, I bet

2350
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
Shut up

2351
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
So anyway

2352
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
and of course the one that I linked on here

2353
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
is actually the Nintendo 64 one

2354
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
which was the very first Dobutsu no Mori

2355
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
It came out in Japan on April 14, 2001

2356
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
and came out on the GameCube as

2357
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
Animal Forest Plus

2358
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
in

2359
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
the next December

2360
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
so that was in 2002

2361
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
and then came out in other countries

2362
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
as Animal Crossing

2363
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
and like I had mentioned earlier

2364
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
in the show, because we got

2365
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
so much more stuff over here

2366
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
they released a new version that was called

2367
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
Animal Forest E Plus

2368
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
which actually has characters in that one

2369
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
that are in no other versions

2370
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
of the game

2371
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
If you want to read more about them, look on the wiki

2372
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
There's a really, really good

2373
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
Animal Crossing wiki

2374
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
So the game itself

2375
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
is

2376
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
No, Bobby, I'm not doing Halo

2377
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
So the game itself

2378
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
has evolved over time

2379
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
but I'm going to focus on the

2380
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
GameCube one since that is

2381
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
probably the one

2382
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
the majority of us have started with

2383
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
So with the very first

2384
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
game, and it was

2385
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
like this on the Nintendo 64 as well

2386
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
you would

2387
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
arrive in town

2388
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
homeless

2389
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
penniless and get forced into

2390
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
indentured servitude by the

2391
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
evil Tom Nook

2392
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
who is the mobster

2393
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
boss of your town

2394
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
it's in all

2395
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
reality, you know, it's a very

2396
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
open-ended game, it keeps going, you have

2397
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
different holidays in town

2398
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
you have to, you know, earn money

2399
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
and pay off your mortgage

2400
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
and you can expand your house

2401
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
people were there

2402
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
to collect NES games

2403
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
that's what they were there for

2404
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
sorry, I can't contain myself

2405
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
so anyway

2406
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
you have to

2407
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
you know

2408
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
you earn Bells, which is the in-game currency

2409
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
you pay off your loan

2410
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
and in the

2411
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
and you hit villagers with bug nets

2412
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
you know, I keep hitting that fucker Ed

2413
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
with a bug net and he won't move

2414
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
I'm not the only one having to

2415
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
deal with Ed by the way

2416
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
so, he's a dumb horse

2417
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
so anyway, you also could

2418
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
collect Nintendo

2419
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
Entertainment games

2420
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
and as far as I'm aware

2421
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
I think this just popped up

2422
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
in

2423
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
I want to say just in the

2424
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
GameCube ones

2425
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
you basically

2426
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
you could get, you know, Ice Climber

2427
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
and Mario Brothers

2428
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
those were available via

2429
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
eReader

2430
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
there were all kinds of

2431
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
they also said that The Legend of Zelda

2432
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
was in the game, but they had no means

2433
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
of obtaining it

2434
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
I think it was supposed to be like a prize or something

2435
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
so yeah

2436
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
there were different multiplayer modes as well

2437
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
where you could

2438
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
have up to four people living

2439
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
in the village

2440
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
you couldn't play at the

2441
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
same time as anybody else, but you could take turns

2442
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
like, Dan and I would see

2443
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
who could pay off our mortgage faster

2444
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
and who got the gold statue and who got the silver statue

2445
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
and finally I'm like, bitch make your own town

2446
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
so he has Danville

2447
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
that was his town

2448
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
you also

2449
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
can

2450
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
ship items from one to another

2451
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
via codes

2452
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
and you can say, hey

2453
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
milk you asshole, send this to Rob

2454
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
and Fetch, which is your town now

2455
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
isn't it? What was your old town?

2456
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
Rob is...

2457
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
sorry I was eating

2458
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
my old town was

2459
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
I think it was like Robville or something silly

2460
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
yeah, well Dan had Danville because Danville

2461
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
exists

2462
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
you could also leave messages to each other

2463
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
on the big board

2464
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
that's in the center of town

2465
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
and I still do that when I visit people's

2466
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
towns as I'll say, hey Jamie was here

2467
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
so and so sucks

2468
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
steal Ed from me, still trying to steal Kabuki from you

2469
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
now this I wanted to play a little bit

2470
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
do you hear how the voice sounds?

2471
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
now

2472
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
in the Japanese version

2473
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
basically they are

2474
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
they say every syllable

2475
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
every kana

2476
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
so you can actually, I mean it's really

2477
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
sped up and fast, but you can actually kind of

2478
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
pick out what they're saying

2479
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
for the American, for the English versions

2480
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
basically they say each letter

2481
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
so it really does sound like a bunch of gibberish

2482
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
and the voices of course

2483
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
went a little bit differently because they had to

2484
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
redo them to say each of the letters

2485
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
you had another thing

2486
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
that was only in the earlier ones

2487
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
and that was

2488
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
Mr. Resetti or as he was

2489
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
called in Japan, I think he was Resetsan

2490
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
so

2491
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
if you turned off your game without saving

2492
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
the next time you turned it on, he'd pop out of the ground

2493
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
and berate you for like an hour

2494
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
so basically he annoyed you into not doing it again

2495
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
you um

2496
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
now the part that's showing on the video right now

2497
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
if you can kind of hear some of it

2498
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
is where you talk to Rover

2499
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
who basically he asks you questions

2500
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
and depending on how you answer it determines what your looks are

2501
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
so

2502
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
I always cheat and use an FAQ

2503
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
so that my character will look how I want her to look

2504
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
um

2505
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
now with the GameCube one you could also use

2506
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
the Game Boy Advance to do stuff on the island

2507
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
you were able to

2508
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
um

2509
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
uh

2510
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
basically get fruits from villagers

2511
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
you get bells, you would be able to

2512
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
use the islanders tools

2513
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
and bury things

2514
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
and pick them up later

2515
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
you also were able to um

2516
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
use uh

2517
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
the pattern design tool for the Able Sisters

2518
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
on your Game Boy Advance

2519
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
so you were able to use that to create

2520
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
different things

2521
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
another thing that you know

2522
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
is still one of my favorite parts of the game

2523
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
um is that uh

2524
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
you had a character who

2525
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
in the Japanese version his name was Toda Keke

2526
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
who if I remember right

2527
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
he was named after

2528
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
a music composer

2529
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
um over here he's Keke Spider

2530
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
and he would

2531
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
he would sing different uh

2532
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
songs in the old ones he would

2533
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
sing in I believe it was the town square

2534
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
um in later versions

2535
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
he would also sing at the Roost Cafe

2536
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
now he actually has Club Lowell

2537
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
where he sings on Saturday nights

2538
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
and you listen to the song and you can

2539
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
get a demo version and now the stores

2540
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
actually sell his music

2541
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
you can also use um the music

2542
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
as the album art

2543
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
on your wall as a poster

2544
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
but going back to the um

2545
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
okay here it is it was actually um

2546
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
Totaka Kazumi

2547
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
um so that's where Toda Keke's name came from

2548
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
so uh

2549
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
at any rate the game had

2550
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
absolutely

2551
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
adorable music just really neat songs

2552
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
you had all kinds of genre

2553
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
represented in Toda Keke's music

2554
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
um

2555
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
and then um just the background music

2556
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
was really iconic I mean

2557
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
to this day I still like I was

2558
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
saying I've gone around singing the stupid

2559
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
theme song to my cat

2560
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
you know I'd like to play

2561
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
the game at certain times of the day because

2562
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
certain music will play I really

2563
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
love the midnight music I love to play

2564
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
at midnight just because of the music

2565
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
now the other thing that you had going on in this game was

2566
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
your collection

2567
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
you could collect um

2568
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
uh well I'm not gonna

2569
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
say these are officially a collectible item

2570
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
but you get the um haniwa

2571
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
which uh we got as gyroids

2572
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
which after it rained you could dig them up

2573
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
in the ground because back in the old school

2574
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
days haniwa were buried with the dead

2575
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
so that's why you dig them

2576
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
up out of the ground

2577
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
um and

2578
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
Alpha Kinanagram also wants to point out that

2579
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
Totaka has um

2580
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
his uh song which actually

2581
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
is in the game

2582
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
as Keke's song

2583
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
the little hidden thing that was also in Mario

2584
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
Paint and all the different

2585
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
you know things that he ever did sound designed

2586
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
for so

2587
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
um

2588
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
at any rate um you could

2589
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
collect fish and there are certain fish

2590
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
that show up at different times of the year you have different

2591
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
bugs that show up at a different time of the year

2592
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
you also could collect um works of art

2593
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
different paintings and like

2594
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
and you also had different special

2595
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
characters that would pop up I already mentioned

2596
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
Mr. Resetti you had the able sisters

2597
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
who made the clothes you had

2598
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
Tom Nook who was the

2599
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
evil mafia boss of the town

2600
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
um also there uh

2601
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
he was the one percent of

2602
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
my village you had

2603
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
uh

2604
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
the police dogs copper

2605
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
and what was the other one's name

2606
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
I can't remember the other one's name

2607
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
um there were

2608
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
uh

2609
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
now we have Isabelle and Digby

2610
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
in the newer ones uh

2611
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
Isabelle is your uh apparently she never

2612
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
sleeps cause she is at the stupid

2613
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
uh town hall all

2614
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
the damn time you could change

2615
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
your town theme you could change catch

2616
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
phrases like we used to make people say some

2617
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
really dirty ass things and Nintendo finally got

2618
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
smart and yeah

2619
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
might have been an offender with that

2620
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
well I've got um

2621
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
Rowan going around wearing the Link

2622
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
outfit saying kitty fuck

2623
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
hahaha

2624
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
um you know

2625
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
we used to have Dina remember Dina

2626
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
and she apparently

2627
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
um is no longer

2628
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
a gym teacher but a music

2629
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
teacher she's a folk singer

2630
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
Rob staying with her ways

2631
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
nice um

2632
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
but you know all of your different villagers you've got

2633
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
different um types of personalities

2634
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
they actually brought back the

2635
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
uh sort of big sister personality

2636
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
the perky and the

2637
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
uh sort of friendly older brother personality

2638
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
that were in earlier games

2639
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
um and different characters that go back and forth

2640
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
now the other thing with this is it is

2641
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
and I've mentioned this before

2642
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
Bobby, Bobby said he made

2643
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
all this town people say just ignore him

2644
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
Halo classic game of the year it's not gonna happen

2645
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
he's trolling you and it's working I know but I'm just

2646
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
laughing at him because he's still trying

2647
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
and it's just not funny

2648
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
um

2649
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
I've made

2650
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
Ed say I totally suck is his

2651
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
greeting and then his catch phrase is

2652
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
I really suck

2653
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
I fucking hate Ed

2654
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
um now in the newer ones you've got

2655
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
like you can have a campsite where people can

2656
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
visit and they'll play stupid games and

2657
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
steal your money fuckers

2658
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
I mean just all kinds of stuff to do

2659
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
and there's the island you know I mentioned the island

2660
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
and

2661
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
I can't help it I had

2662
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
I've had so much fun with

2663
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
the first game now to bring up

2664
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
um what I was talking about about

2665
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
the dialogue about it you know since

2666
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
Japanese is basically a syllabic

2667
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
uh alphabet

2668
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
I picked up the GameCube

2669
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
one in Japanese to practice my reading

2670
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
and lo and behold my

2671
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
reading actually improved I mean I'm way

2672
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
out of practice now but it was a

2673
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
very very good educational tool so

2674
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
I'm actually offering this out here

2675
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
to anyone who happens to be

2676
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
a beginner learner who's

2677
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
wanting to practice your reading to

2678
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
understand grammar and syntax

2679
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
basically get Animal Crossing on GameCube

2680
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
I mean use it to import

2681
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,000
other copies it will really

2682
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
really really help your reading comprehension

2683
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
in Japanese and it's not kanji

2684
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
heavy so

2685
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
you don't have to really worry about it

2686
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
um so anyway

2687
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
there's so much to do

2688
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
the original was fun

2689
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
the newer ones are fun I mean they kind of got

2690
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
stale with City Folk

2691
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
and Wild World but I think

2692
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
that um the last one

2693
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
that um New Leaf

2694
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
really has brought back a lot

2695
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
of the fun that was in the game I mean of course you

2696
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
don't have the uh NES games heading around

2697
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
but it's still super fun I mean

2698
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
I think

2699
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
anybody can appreciate it I still say though and I said this on

2700
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
a previous show but I wish they'd just develop a

2701
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
handful not a lot but a handful of very

2702
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
simple like flash style games

2703
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
that you could unlock that would be a lot of fun

2704
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
or maybe old Game & Watch

2705
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
oh yeah that would be cool

2706
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
things that they don't sell at all in Virtual Console

2707
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
until then I will have to make myself

2708
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
happy by being very very

2709
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
this is the other thing I was going to mention

2710
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
is that there was a full length movie

2711
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
um based off it and it actually had

2712
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
as your animal characters it had

2713
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
they were all characters in the game

2714
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,000
and one of them lives in my village now

2715
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
in the US she's Margie

2716
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
in uh in Japan she's Sally

2717
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
the elephant who's like one of the main main characters

2718
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
lives in my village and I found out

2719
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
that Act Duff has a bouquet

2720
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
or Rosie in the US one

2721
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
so I was sort of like oh that's

2722
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
cool sort of like a way to be

2723
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
involved so anyway

2724
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
um Animal Crossing

2725
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
lots of fun alright there it is

2726
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
your classic game of the week

2727
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
Animal Forest

2728
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
or Animal Crossing is the case

2729
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
maybe uh very awesome

2730
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
game I do love that game

2731
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,000
uh yep and I love the 3DS one too

2732
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
so um even though I do miss the NES

2733
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
games but uh a good pick

2734
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
another great pick while we're going down

2735
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
these games that are 10 plus years

2736
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
old yet I remember them like they were

2737
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
yesterday anyway

2738
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
you know if Bobby keeps trolling me about Halo it's never

2739
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000

and uh looking at our

2761
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
chat room we were playing a kind of a variety

2762
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
of music during the break there some

2763
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
uh mostly like Super Nintendo classics

2764
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
in there uh although we did have Animal

2765
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
Crossing music starting it off we did have uh

2766
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
I played something from Chrono Trigger

2767
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
but then I played a Super Metroid song right after it

2768
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
to try and troll Bobby back a little bit for you

2769
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
Dark Sakura but then I followed it with a game

2770
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
we can all agree is amazing A Link to the Past

2771
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
so just a variety of music and uh

2772
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
I like how our chatters who are

2773
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000

2774
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000

2775
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000

2776
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000

2781
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
much

2782
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
I have a really good story about Animal Crossing

2783
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
and that would be the way like I actually got

2784
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
Animal Crossing um actually

2785
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
Loki actually bought Animal Crossing for

2786
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
me um years ago we used to

2787
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
all put well you know we were all playing DDR we all

2788
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
used to post on these local forums for

2789
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
uh Sacramento DDR players and

2790
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
I remember we were all pretty close I mean there was only about

2791
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
like maybe 20 of us that actually ever posted on these boards

2792
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
regularly but we were all a pretty close group

2793
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
you know this was before Facebook and any of

2794
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
that shit maybe about the time Live Journal was starting

2795
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
to boom and uh Loki was

2796
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
like you know um

2797
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
what would you do if you just got a big bonus at work

2798
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
what would you spend the money on I said I'd get a

2799
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
GameCube and Animal Crossing and I come home from work

2800
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
and what did Loki do he bought me a GameCube and Animal

2801
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
Crossing it was one of the nicest things

2802
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
it was one of the nicest things anyone's ever done for me so

2803
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
now we're all poor as much of an asshole

2804
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
as you are on this show sometimes Loki

2805
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
deep down in he's a really nice guy so

2806
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
there you go I told a nice story

2807
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
about Loki on this show but no I

2808
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
really appreciated that to this day that was like one of

2809
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
a really awesome thing so

2810
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
uh so hearing the music I

2811
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
came home and that was on loop because I guess they

2812
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
left it powered on I don't even know how you got into the house

2813
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
you must have contacted my roommate at the time or something

2814
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
yeah and uh set that all

2815
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
up so that when I got home from work it was already on the

2816
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000

2817
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000

PayPal was going into the funds too

2880
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
I forgot about that they still made

2881
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
like other kickstarters they still may take money

2882
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
via PayPal after

2883
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000

2891
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
later

2892
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
all right and uh

2893
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
I know this game was crack for us

2894
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
a little bit ago

2895
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
seems like a little bit ago probably a couple years ago

2896
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
tiny tower

2897
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
is back and now tiny tower

2898
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
has a new licensed product

2899
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
Star Wars tiny

2900
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
death star

2901
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
coming to a mobile platform near you

2902
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
that sounds kind of awesome I've got to say

2903
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
are you going to build a tiny death star dark

2904
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
sakura maybe

2905
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
she's already building one in her house no

2906
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
because I have

2907
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
I have a

2908
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
I have a village to run I'm the mayor

2909
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
I'm empress sakura of normandy and I don't have time

2910
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
for a death star

2911
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
this makes me think of when they did that whole like

2912
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
what's that website where you can do the white house

2913
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
petitions or whatever and somebody

2914
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
actually asks whitehouse.org

2915
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
maybe or .gov

2916
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
I thought they had like a spinoff site or something where you can do the

2917
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
petitions specifically

2918
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
oh I thought it was like a separate website

2919
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
I don't know if I'm looking forward to

2920
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
the inevitable

2921
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
version you know kill ball heights

2922
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
you know where they

2923
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
have where you know

2924
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
design your own

2925
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
yeah

2926
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
and then finally

2927
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
you know because there's a lot of movie

2928
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
or games

2929
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
based on movies coming out but we have another

2930
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
date for one warcraft

2931
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
the movie coming to theaters

2932
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
December 18th 2015

2933
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
and

2934
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
yeah

2935
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,000
hell I know need for speeds coming

2936
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,000
out next spring

2937
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
I kind of want to see it just because it looks like

2938
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,000
a generic racing action movie

2939
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,000
we still don't know who's

2940
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
in the cast for the warcraft movie though just a date

2941
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,000
and I'm thinking like

2942
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
ok that's a placeholder date that's one of those

2943
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
hollywood games of chess

2944
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
where they start to block out what movies

2945
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
are coming out when and get away from my movie

2946
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
and all that and you know

2947
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
so don't hold fast that this

2948
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
will actually go through

2949
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
because it might get delayed to 2016

2950
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
it might come out earlier sometimes movies come out

2951
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
earlier although I doubt that because I haven't even started filming

2952
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
yet so

2953
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,000
yeah I mean I don't know

2954
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,000
I guess it starts filming next year

2955
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
in January but

2956
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
I'm not really excited

2957
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
for it because I don't know any of the

2958
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,000
lore so it's just like hey

2959
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,000
Lord of the Rings again or something

2960
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,000
if the movie is going to be successful it's got to be accessible

2961
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
to non warcraft players

2962
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
it has to be all about thrall

2963
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,000
I don't care I want thrall the movie

2964
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
I think they're taking it way back well it was supposed to be alliance centered

2965
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
but that was an early rumor

2966
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
but Varian's a dick and no one cares

2967
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,000
I think it's going back I don't think the game

2968
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
is going to be based off of World of Warcraft

2969
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,000
or the movie is going to be based off of

2970
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
World of Warcraft I think the movie is going to be based off of

2971
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,000
Warcraft or like Warcraft 3

2972
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
maybe well that's cool

2973
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,000
because then you get

2974
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
a what's your face who I think is awesome

2975
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
Sylvanas that'd be cool

2976
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
now Tigerclaw

2977
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,000
points out that the Warcraft movie is going to

2978
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,000
December 2015 because 2015 is

2979
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
overcrowded with some huge blockbuster

2980
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,000
movies during the summer already

2981
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,000
yeah isn't that when the

2982
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
Age of Ultros comes out is 2015

2983
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
as well right Avengers 2

2984
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,000
and then what else is in the summer

2985
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,000
2015 is that when Independence Day 2 is

2986
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,000
finally happening oh my god I'm so

2987
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
excited I only care about

2988
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,000
it see like it starts you know

2989
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
just like you know last Independence Day I saw it

2990
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,000
was a third fourth and fifth I

2991
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
kind of want to do that again I hope it's terrible

2992
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,000
I hope it's absolutely I hope it is absolutely

2993
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
god awful and I will be there every day I hope

2994
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
Elizabeth Berkley is on the cast because that would be

2995
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,000
awesome but it still has to have Jeff

2996
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,000
Goldblum it is supposedly having

2997
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,000
Jeff Goldblum the only one that's not coming back is Will Smith

2998
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
but it'll be like Will Smith's kid

2999
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
because he's like I'm a real actor now bye

3000
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
Will Smith's kid well it's not even Will Smith's kid

3001
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
it's just going to be some other like

3002
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000
other dude that's going to be like some

3003
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,000
some other black pilot you know that's

3004
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,000
going to be in the role who cares

3005
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,000
you know what it doesn't matter it's not all about

3006
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,000
Will Smith you know what they need uh

3007
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,000
Randy Quaid ghost only way

3008
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,000
they can make this movie Randy Quaid ghost

3009
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,000
slash zombie the chat room

3010
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,000
is making fun of me because apparently I had

3011
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,000
a Freudian slip and I said age of

3012
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
Ultros instead of Ultron

3013
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,000
you know you've been playing too much

3014
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000
Final Fantasy when dot dot

3015
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
dot wow

3016
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,000
it would make for a more interesting movie

3017
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,000
to be honest yeah it's true

3018
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,000
honestly let's be real it would be a better

3019
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,000
movie okay I'm I'm

3020
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,000
I'm pissed because no actually

3021
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
in the Marvel comics right now they're

3022
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,000
they're pushing an age of Ultron right now

3023
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,000
and I think that's the only reason why the next

3024
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
movie is going to be Ultron

3025
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,000
because it was fully set up for

3026
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,000
Thanos hello yeah I know right

3027
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,000
they just want to make you wait till three

3028
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,000
I just I just thought of a tagline since

3029
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,000
we're bringing Elizabeth Berkeley

3030
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,000
into the cast as she should be uh

3031
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,000
independence Independence Day

3032
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
everybody got independence and shit

3033
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,000
that

3034
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,000
that is so obscure

3035
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,000
there's like maybe five percent of the

3036
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,000
audience if that is going to get that reference

3037
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,000
but I love you just a little bit

3038
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,000
more for making it Rob what

3039
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,000
darling you are independent

3040
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,000
I don't know what you're doing

3041
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
in that jet but it sure as hell

3042
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,000
ain't fighting any

3043
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,000
no

3044
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,000
one understands no

3045
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,000
one I think the people who do understand

3046
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,000
will make up for the ones that don't other movies

3047
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,000
coming out in 2015 star wars

3048
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,000
uh star wars episode seven

3049
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:54,000
star star what

3050
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,000
yeah

3051
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,000
some flop movie in space

3052
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
no I'm kidding actually if the rumors are true that Daniel

3053
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
Day-Lewis is going to be in it

3054
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,000
like that guy can like he could

3055
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
act the phone book and it would be amazing

3056
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,000
did you see the mock-up poster that some

3057
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,000
I think it was like a photoshopping job but it was

3058
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,000
sure it was really cool yeah that

3059
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:14,000
had like the original actors and everything

3060
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,000
you know looking their age and all that

3061
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,000
as the characters would have been later on

3062
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,000
that's pretty cool oh I do want drunk

3063
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,000
Carrie Fisher in the movie so that would be

3064
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:24,000
awesome

3065
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,000
uh yeah oh man

3066
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,000
alright and also in 2015 sorry I know this is

3067
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,000
rapid fire news I'm using my quoting fingers

3068
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,000
also in 2015 let's not forget

3069
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,000
Batfleck is in 2015

3070
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,000
and

3071
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,000
you know what here's the thing though

3072
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,000
here's the thing I

3073
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,000
love Batman

3074
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,000
stuff and

3075
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:46,000
my favorite Batman honestly

3076
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:48,000
is the Adam West era Batman

3077
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,000
um

3078
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
can it really get any cheesier than that

3079
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
I don't know yeah but did you see

3080
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,000
Daredevil well that was bad

3081
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:58,000
can it really be worse than Batman and Robin

3082
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,000
can it really get any worse

3083
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,000
that's a good good question cause

3084
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,000
that movie was bad you know the only reason

3085
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,000
I saw it was because someone else paid for

3086
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,000
it and drugged me along to see it

3087
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,000
must be nice cause I wasn't gonna

3088
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,000
spend any money on that and that's still two hours of my life

3089
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,000
I can't get back I wanted to see it because

3090
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,000
there is no such way there is no

3091
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,000
way that Arnold

3092
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,000
Schwarzenegger as Mr. Freeze is not gonna be

3093
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,000
entertaining there is like no

3094
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,000
way everybody chews

3095
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,000
there is no way that's not gonna be entertaining

3096
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
oh god as a lifelong Batman

3097
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,000
fan I'm kinda resigned to the fact that he kinda

3098
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,000
goes in cycles you got the goofy Adam

3099
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,000
Westing kinda thing then you got the ultra

3100
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:36,000
super serious reboot and then you

3101
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,000
got you know it bleeds into the Adam Westing again

3102
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,000
eh you know come back around

3103
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,000
I'll give it a chance because everybody

3104
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,000
hated the idea of Michael Keaton as well

3105
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:46,000
and he turned out to be awesome but here's the

3106
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:48,000
thing the original Batman was also

3107
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,000
a Tim Burton movie and then

3108
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,000
you know who was the guy that did the next trilogy

3109
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,000
why am I his name is slipping my mind right now

3110
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,000
no not Schumacher fuck him the next guy

3111
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:58,000
those movies were terrible the guy who just did

3112
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,000
these recent three where did he get the goddamn name

3113
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,000
oh my god

3114
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,000
bad fan

3115
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,000
well I'll put it

3116
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,000
he proved himself and when he cast Heath Ledger

3117
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:10,000
I know a lot of people were skeptical but I was like

3118
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,000
no Batman Begins was the shit

3119
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,000
Christopher Nolan thank you Christopher Nolan

3120
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:16,000
Batman Begins was the shit

3121
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,000
this guy knows what he's doing I will trust

3122
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,000
his judgement but here's the thing Zach

3123
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,000
Snyder I don't

3124
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,000
know about you sir

3125
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,000
for the record by the way I am not

3126
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:28,000
going to see it because I am currently

3127
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,000
on a DC boycott

3128
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,000
no I'm serious

3129
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,000
because of how they're

3130
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:36,000
treating their writers for their portrayal

3131
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,000
of women in their comics and

3132
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,000
for the whole marriage bullshit

3133
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,000
just so that they don't have to let Batwoman

3134
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,000
get married yeah that was a little weird

3135
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:46,000
also their audition for a new

3136
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:48,000
artist here draw Harley Quinn trying to

3137
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:50,000
kill herself in three panels sexy

3138
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,000
underwear sexy yeah that was a little weird

3139
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:54,000
DC needs

3140
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,000
to be a publicist they've seriously

3141
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,000
fallen off the taste truck

3142
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,000
off of the progressive taste truck

3143
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,000
because DC used to be pretty progressive

3144
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,000
with their characters and hit every branch

3145
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:06,000
on the idiot tree and they've fallen

3146
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,000
into the stinky

3147
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,000
republican onion truck alright

3148
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,000
look moving on

3149
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,000

3150
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,000
happier and gay and I mean it

01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,000
I like gay gamerX

3158
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,000
they have moved to a venue that is

3159
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,000
three times as large thank god

3160
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,000
it's the Intercontinental Hotel

3161
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,000
in San Francisco which is right next to Moscone

3162
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:40,000
Center if I'm not mistaking and they've

3163
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,000
already announced some of the guests for it

3164
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,000

signed up as a sponsor of the event

3166
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,000
which cross your fingers

3167
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,000
your toes hold your breath

3168
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,000

01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:56,000
amazing

and so much more out there

3195
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,000
I know there's plans to do something

3196
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,000
podcast cross zone 2 but like

3197
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:50,000
bigger better

3198
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:52,000
and it's going to have to be

3199
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,000
with all these extra people that now want to be a part

3200
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:56,000
of it which is a great thing

3201
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:58,000
what a horrible situation to be in

3202
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:00,000
it's too popular of an event

3203
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,000
I want to go

3204
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:04,000
you can get your tickets now

3205
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,000
but if you can't get them right now because of financial whatever

3206
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,000
they'll be on sale until they're not

3207
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,000
we need to do a panel

3208
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,000
it'll be fun I think we should

3209
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,000
let's do a panel

3210
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:16,000
alright we'll talk we'll get to talking

3211
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,000
anyhow gamerX.com if you want more information

3212
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,000
on that information on Rocksmith

3213
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,000
2014 edition

3214
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:24,000
adding some more songs to kind of round

3215
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:26,000
out their song list

3216
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:28,000
Rocksmith 2014 edition will include

3217
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:30,000
Def Leppard's Pour Some Sugar On Me

3218
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:32,000
Queen's

3219
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:34,000
We Are The Champions

3220
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:36,000
and Mary Jane's Last Dance from Tom Petty

3221
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,000
and the Heartbreakers

3222
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:40,000
and a song for Bobby Rush is going to be in the game

3223
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:42,000
with the Spirit of Radio

3224
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,000
I love Rush. Rush is Canada's best

3225
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,000
export

3226
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,000
I still love Alanis Morissette that's the 90's kid in me

3227
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,000
but anyway some disagree with me

3228
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:52,000
but deal with it

3229
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,000
there's lots of great songs in the game I'm not going to read the entire song list

3230
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:56,000
but remember that Rocksmith is like

3231
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:58,000
the no really stop hitting plastic

3232
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:00,000
buttons and learn how to play an actual

3233
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,000
guitar so you know

3234
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:04,000
if you want to go to guitar school Rocksmith 2014

3235
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:06,000
is the way to do it. Also there's

3236
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:08,000
what's called color blind mode which I think is

3237
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:10,000
pretty cool

3238
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:12,000
one of the producers is actually color blind

3239
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,000
and you can actually adjust the hues

3240
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:16,000
and the color saturation levels throughout

3241
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,000
the entire game to be a little

3242
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,000
better for the color blind because I guess

3243
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,000
the first game got a little flack for

3244
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:24,000
it so they are going to make it a little better

3245
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,000
this time around so kudos for accessibility

3246
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,000
and lastly

3247
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,000
coming to an arcade

3248
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:32,000
near you

3249
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:34,000
yes an arcade near you

3250
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,000
Plants vs. Zombies

3251
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,000
The Last Stand

3252
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,000
I'm assuming they turn Plants vs. Zombies

3253
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,000
into a ticket spitter because that's

3254
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:44,000
all arcade games are anymore

3255
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,000
yeah it is a

3256
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:48,000
video redemption product yes yes of course

3257
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,000
there's already a

3258
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,000
bejeweled one that surprised me I've never seen one

3259
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,000
of those but I guess that is out there but yes

3260
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,000
look for more information on Plants vs. Zombies coming

3261
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,000
to an arcade near you soon

3262
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:00,000
Dark Sakura

3263
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,000
we're actually having a small discussion

3264
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:04,000
in chat by the way

3265
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:06,000
there needs to be the Jessica Jones

3266
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:08,000
TV show I'm going to cry

3267
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:10,000
have you been watching Shield at all?

3268
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:12,000
no and I need to

3269
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,000
but

3270
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:16,000
Jessica Jones is my favorite Marvel character

3271
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:18,000
ever and if none of you have read

3272
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,000
Alias which had nothing to do with the TV show

3273
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:22,000
read it well if Shield goes anything

3274
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:24,000
like another ABC show Once Upon a

3275
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,000
Time they will roll out

3276
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:28,000
those characters just to like

3277
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,000
make you watch now they have their

3278
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,000
spin-off yeah they have the spin-off they just released

3279
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,000
a picture of Jafar apparently for some reason

3280
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:36,000
is in Wonderland I'm not even going to try and figure that one

3281
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:38,000
out but it's just like you know

3282
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,000
who can we roll out next?

3283
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,000
yeah Chell what'd you want to say

3284
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,000
yeah the character thing

3285
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:46,000
I was you know

3286
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:48,000
I started watching

3287
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:50,000
Once Upon a Time as kind of my trashy show

3288
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:52,000
and then I got emotionally involved

3289
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:54,000
and then it jumped the shark like

3290
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:56,000
whoa and I'm just

3291
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:58,000
I'm basically watching it out of train wreck syndrome

3292
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:00,000
so yeah I hadn't heard about Jafar

3293
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,000
but now I need to check out the freaking

3294
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:04,000
Alice in Wonderland well here's the thing

3295
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:06,000
even I'm not really watching

3296
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:08,000
Once Upon a Time but it is like next on my

3297
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:10,000
list once I finish off Scandal

3298
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:12,000
which is far more important but

3299
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:14,000
even I've seen

3300
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:16,000
the pictures of Captain Hook

3301
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:18,000
and that is uh oh yeah

3302
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:20,000
you know I said

3303
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:22,000
you know not even Robert Carlyle can get me

3304
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,000
back for the third series they got me back

3305
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:28,000
for my

3306
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:30,000
rapid fire news there's

3307
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,000
I am getting so sick of these

3308
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:34,000

01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,000

01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,000
I um basically it's about

3316
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,000
66 games that are not

3317
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:52,000
on Steam they're all by indie developers

3318
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:54,000
that are for sale at

3319
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:56,000

01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:58,000
Super Markdown there's some really cool

Earth Adventure One Finger Death Punch

3324
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,000
which actually I think is now on

3325
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:08,000
Steam. What's Pushcat?

3326
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:10,000
That one I haven't checked out

3327
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,000
there's one called Rose in Time

3328
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:14,000
there's uh scanning a truck driving simulator

3329
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:16,000
Six Sided Sanctuary

3330
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:18,000
looked like a fun one I almost bought that one

3331
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:20,000
The Sea Will Claim Everything

3332
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:22,000
Tiny Barbarian DX

3333
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:24,000
lots of really neat games on there and there's also

3334
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:26,000
Alphas there's another game on here by the way

3335
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,000
that's called We'll Fight for Food

3336
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:30,000
Nice. Oh this one

3337
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,000
called Spud's Quest looks cute

3338
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,000
yeah there's just a lot of neat looking games on there

3339
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:36,000
Nice. And in a not

3340
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,000
so indie game um

3341
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,000
we all like Borderlands don't we?

3342
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,000
Well

3343
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:44,000
2k and Gearbox

3344
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:46,000
have a $100,000

3345
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:48,000
worth of prizes for an

3346
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,000
in-game loot hunt for Borderlands

3347
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,000
2 so basically on

3348
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:54,000
October 11th at 10

3349
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,000
Eastern Time

3350
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,000
the game will be altered so

3351
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:00,000
that these weird guns are gonna start

3352
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,000
dropping in odd places

3353
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:04,000
so like

3354
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,000
the knuckle dragger will drop on

3355
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,000
Gwen's head

3356
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:10,000
no sorry the knuckle dragger will drop Gwen's head

3357
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:12,000
my apologies

3358
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,000
so basically you fulfill

3359
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,000
their little requirements and

3360
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:18,000
you could win a prize. I will not tell you

3361
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:20,000
anymore about it cause you need to go check it out yourself

3362
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:22,000
and then

3363
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:24,000
last but not least there is a new Sonic

3364
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,000
game in development for

3365
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:28,000
Xbox One and PS4 and Wii U

3366
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:30,000
and

3367
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:32,000
I believe it's just a working

3368
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:34,000
title Sonic Thunderstorm or Sonic

3369
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:36,000
Blue Thunder

3370
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:38,000
there is

3371
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:40,000
a

3372
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:42,000
looks like there's going to be

3373
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:44,000
a new character named static

3374
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:46,000
the hedgehog and

3375
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:48,000
a teenage clone of Sonic Knuckles

3376
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:50,000
Rogue Eggman will also have teenage clones

3377
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,000
and

3378
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,000
Knuckles clone will be called

3379
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:56,000
Slash the Echidna. Hurray more shitty

3380
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:58,000
friends static the hedgehog

3381
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:00,000
he doesn't move very much

3382
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,000
he's very placement

3383
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:04,000
he's a pretty clingy friend

3384
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:06,000
you can also play as Tails, Amy, Debra

3385
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,000
all these other characters

3386
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,000
and you also have team Chaotix

3387
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,000
which is all that I care about

3388
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:14,000
29 levels, different objects, return of old animals

3389
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,000
and chaos drives and

3390
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:18,000
the Chao Garden

3391
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:20,000
game play will

3392
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,000
change characters like in Sonic Heroes

3393
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:24,000
there's just a bunch of stuff I don't know if it's gonna be any good

3394
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:26,000
but there is the return of the chaos emeralds

3395
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:28,000
yes but what mode

3396
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:30,000
allows me to make them act out

3397
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:32,000
my fan fictions

3398
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:34,000
none, sit down

3399
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:36,000
they're also saying that

3400
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:38,000
wi-fi will transfer Chao data

3401
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:40,000
and you have a Chao Garden

3402
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,000
it will be

3403
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,000
DLC and available in PS Vita and 3DS

3404
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:46,000
so

3405
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:48,000
yay

3406
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:50,000
it better not suck

3407
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,000
let's hope this is a good Sonic game

3408
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:54,000
don't they kind of alternate back and forth

3409
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:56,000
like Star Trek movies

3410
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,000
except that

3411
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:00,000
doesn't apply to the

3412
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,000
Star Trek re-releases

3413
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:04,000
the revamps

3414
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:06,000
because both of them have been good

3415
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:08,000
I think the first one was way better than the second one

3416
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:10,000
but that's just me

3417
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:12,000
womp womp

3418
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:14,000
let's get to

3419
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:16,000
the FUGL question

3420
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:18,000
of the week

3421
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:20,000
every week we ask our listeners

3422
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:22,000
a question on Facebook

3423
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:24,000
and Google Plus

3424
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:26,000
you put that together and you get FUGL

3425
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:28,000
the FUGL question of the week and this week

3426
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:30,000
as I promised it's gonna be all about Pokemon

3427
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:32,000
so we asked our listeners

3428
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:34,000
the most important question possibly

3429
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:36,000
of the millennium

3430
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:38,000
are you team Fennekin

3431
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:40,000
Chespin or Froakie

3432
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:42,000
and for those that don't know

3433
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:44,000
those are the starter Pokemon

3434
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:46,000
in the new X and Y

3435
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:48,000
they're like Bulbasaur

3436
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:50,000
what about option 14 don't give a fuck

3437
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:52,000
well actually I did ask

3438
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:54,000
as part of the question

3439
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:56,000
Pokemon mania looks to be starting all over again

3440
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:58,000
in just a week what do you think of Pokemon

3441
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:00,000
are you picking up X and Y

3442
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:02,000
or are you shocked at the number of grown adults

3443
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:04,000
who obsess over Pokemon

3444
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:06,000
so let's go to Google Plus first

3445
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:08,000
where actdef says team Fennekin

3446
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:10,000
and then he gives us a link to a

3447
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:12,000
community on livejournal

3448
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:14,000
called Pokemon collectors

3449
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:16,000
talking about

3450
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:18,000
his second question and I see that

3451
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:20,000
there's two 3DS's

3452
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:22,000
stuffed animals

3453
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:24,000
yeah actdef might have a problem

3454
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:26,000
but that's okay we still like you

3455
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:28,000
he says seriously though

3456
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:30,000
I've been a Pokemon fan since the red

3457
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:32,000
blue yellow days and I don't see

3458
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:34,000
leaving the Pokemon games and

3459
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:36,000
fandom in his time soon I'm so hyped for X and Y

3460
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:38,000
Jim or excuse me

3461
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:40,000
Flaco Jones says

3462
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:42,000
despite my love of RPGs I never

3463
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,000
got into Pokemon in the first place

3464
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:46,000
now when they come out with a game it seems like

3465
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:48,000
they just expand on old stuff to make the fans

3466
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:50,000
happy a new Pokemon release has never

3467
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:52,000
said to me hey you've never played this

3468
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:54,000
before but this version will really pull

3469
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:56,000
you into the series to be fair

3470
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:58,000
I think they're trying to do that with X and Y a little bit

3471
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,000
one thing I noticed about the 3 starter

3472
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:02,000
Pokemon is that their final forms

3473
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:04,000
kind of fall into the fighter

3474
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:06,000
mage thief

3475
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:08,000
kind of generalisms

3476
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:10,000
you expect in RPGs I found that interesting

3477
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:12,000
Evel

3478
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:14,000
which

3479
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:16,000
might be pronounced that way or E3VL

3480
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:18,000
I'm not sure but Evel responds and says

3481
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:20,000
I'm only purchasing one version of the game

3482
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:22,000
this time around why

3483
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:24,000
seeing the diverse age groups who enjoy the franchise

3484
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:26,000
I hope the creators make the plot more complex

3485
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:28,000
or adult oriented so that varying age

3486
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:30,000
demographics may have a more meaningful

3487
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:32,000
discussion while playing the game together

3488
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:34,000
well yeah but it's Pokemon I mean how

3489
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:36,000
deep is it gonna get

3490
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:38,000
just saying just saying my personal opinion

3491
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:40,000
alright going over to Facebook for some answers

3492
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:42,000
Seattle says

3493
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:44,000
I'm looking to

3494
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:46,000
Team Froakie closely

3495
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:48,000
followed by Team Fennekin and I'm picking up

3496
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:50,000
Y as soon as I can get into the Evel G

3497
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:52,000
to get it as for what I think of the Pokemon

3498
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:54,000
series Yellow was the first game that I

3499
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:56,000
actually owned so they hold a place in

3500
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:58,000
my heart in gaming library which reminds me

3501
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:00,000
I need to make an attempt at figuring out what is wrong with my

3502
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:02,000
copy of Yellow

3503
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:04,000
Shane replied and Shane is Team Chesspin

3504
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:06,000
and I have been counting down the days since

3505
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:08,000
January which is when they announced the games

3506
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:10,000
but had no release dates

3507
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:12,000
this is the most important release this year

3508
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:14,000
it is already my game of 2013

3509
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:16,000
you sound like Loki talking about a different

3510
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:18,000
game just a few weeks ago

3511
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:20,000
JVMON replies

3512
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:22,000
and says Team Froakie I've never

3513
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:24,000
chosen a non water starter

3514
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:26,000
ever since I chose Squirtle and Pokemon Blue

3515
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:28,000
now my only decision is between

3516
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:30,000
X and Y lucky I have both reserved

3517
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:32,000
so I can decide on release day

3518
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:34,000
Pokemon will always be a go to game for me

3519
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:36,000
sure the structure is predictable but that's part of the charm

3520
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:38,000
For the Fallen Dreams says

3521
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:40,000
Team Fennekin motherfuckers

3522
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:42,000
I'm 22 and

3523
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:44,000
Pokemon will never get old to me

3524
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:46,000
it's hands down the best handheld RPG in my

3525
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:48,000
opinion it's the sole reason I'm getting a 3DS

3526
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:50,000
minus a few other titles it's a breath

3527
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:52,000
of fresh air from the constant gore

3528
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:54,000
and violence from more adult oriented video games

3529
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:56,000
Clover N says

3530
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:58,000
my wife and I have pre-ordered an X and

3531
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:00,000
a Y I always choose water type

3532
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:02,000
and my wife always chooses grass type

3533
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:04,000
and let's see

3534
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:06,000
going to the next answer

3535
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:08,000
Burr says Fennekin all the way

3536
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:10,000
I'll see if I can pick it up I haven't actually finished

3537
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:12,000
a Pokemon game yet though I got the

3538
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:14,000
furthest in blue when I first

3539
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:16,000
flirted with it during my freshman year of college

3540
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:18,000
TimTrip

3541
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:20,000
replied and said gonna have to go with Chespin

3542
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:22,000
I don't obsess over Pokemon

3543
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:24,000
but there is a lot about it that is surprisingly

3544
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:26,000
compelling I don't play every generation

3545
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:28,000
because the changes have always been a bit too

3546
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:30,000
incremental from the looks of it

3547
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:32,000
XY has made some significant forward steps

3548
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:34,000
without changing the core of what makes Pokemon

3549
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:36,000
fun so I'll be picking up a copy

3550
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:38,000
Matt J says I've yet to decide

3551
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:40,000
on my starter so can't commit to a team

3552
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:42,000
yet I'm not surprised at all that so

3553
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:44,000
many adults are into Pokemon I'm nearly 29

3554
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:46,000
and still love it however you think

3555
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:48,000
folks around my age were kids when the first

3556
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:50,000
Pokemon games came out I was only 13

3557
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:52,000
when Red and Blue came out here many

3558
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:54,000
of us adults grew up on the series it made

3559
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:56,000
a mark on us a mark that sticks with us to this

3560
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:58,000
day GeoVidea says I

3561
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:00,000
don't even have a 3DS yet hoping for

3562
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:02,000
it as a holiday gift hint hint

3563
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:04,000
and I always pick

3564
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:06,000
fire types it's all about the burn

3565
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:08,000
Andy R says

3566
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:10,000
I got pretty bored with the last few games I didn't even

3567
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:12,000
finish white I'm still considering

3568
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:14,000
buying X or Y but it will probably depend more on

3569
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:16,000
how many of my friends pick it up am I shocked

3570
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:18,000
at grown adults obsessing over Pokemon

3571
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:20,000
no nostalgia is a powerful force

3572
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:22,000
Fifth Dream says Froakie

3573
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:24,000
all the way I always pick water type

3574
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:26,000
starters unless I'm playing a second game

3575
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:28,000
in a generation then I pick a grass

3576
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:30,000
I even bought a Team Froakie

3577
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:32,000
t-shirt to wear when I go pick up my

3578
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:34,000
copy of Pokemon X I'm 39

3579
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:36,000
years old so I am one of those

3580
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:38,000
grown adults who love Pokemon I've

3581
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:40,000
played it since Blue came out and have played

3582
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:42,000
every single generation some twice

3583
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:44,000
and the spinoffs so yeah Pokemon's great

3584
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:46,000
Raginator says I'm on

3585
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:48,000
team who gives a fuck finally

3586
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:50,000
well I mean we haven't

3587
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:52,000
we haven't had anyone yet say

3588
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:54,000
I don't care but here's Raginator to

3589
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:56,000
break that trend saying I'm not getting

3590
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:58,000
Pokemon X and Y I've yet to buy any

3591
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:00,000
Pokemon game I'm not going to start now

3592
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:02,000
Pokemon is about as interesting as being

3593
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:04,000
repeatedly anal probed by aliens

3594
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:06,000
non-stop for six months followed by swimming

3595
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:08,000
in raw sewage you're nasty

3596
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:10,000
you nasty you know what but it's

3597
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:12,000
it's hard I don't think one can make

3598
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:14,000
a judgement until they've played one yeah what's the

3599
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:16,000
why there though I'm not hearing the

3600
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:18,000
why do you feel so strongly

3601
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:20,000
against Pokemon I'm not hearing that some people

3602
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:22,000
just want to be ornery

3603
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:24,000
yeah I don't know did you just post that

3604
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:26,000
for shock value sir

3605
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:28,000
alright degenerate Johnny says I'm with team

3606
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:30,000
frokey because it rhymes with Loki

3607
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:36,000
alright

3608
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:38,000
anyway I'm not at all surprised that so many

3609
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:40,000
adults play these games because

3610
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:42,000
they want to rub it in the faces of six year olds

3611
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:44,000
I mean to dominate six year I mean

3612
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:46,000
I really mean never mind I give it up

3613
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:48,000
our pal wicked from the

3614
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:50,000
nerdgasm network says I've been out of the Pokemon

3615
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:52,000
fold since emerald and given how

3616
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:54,000
X Y looks like a pseudo reboot

3617
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:56,000
it looks like it's time to get back in I'm glad

3618
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:58,000
that we're finally getting a game that looks like the

3619
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:00,000
anime and while the Pokemon count is

3620
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,000
count is utterly nutterly butterly

3621
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:04,000
I still think there's a lot

3622
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:06,000
to be had in collecting them all to collect

3623
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:08,000
them all I'm going for frokey

3624
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:10,000
because Greninja looks

3625
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:12,000
sick as hell plus I'll have a fire

3626
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:14,000
starter from the Torchic special

3627
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:16,000
event and I can never say no to having a Bulbasaur

3628
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:18,000
a well rounded team ahoy

3629
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:20,000
uh Hitstun says at the moment I think

3630
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:22,000
I'm getting Pokemon X and starting with Chespin

3631
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:24,000
once the game's been out for a week and we

3632
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:26,000
know more about the popular Pokemon and how to

3633
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:28,000
counter pick them I'll be ready to delete

3634
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:30,000
my save, start again, and

3635
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:32,000
work towards my ideal team from the beginning

3636
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:34,000
I already preordered Pokemon

3637
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:36,000
Blue fifteen years ago but I skipped

3638
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:38,000
generations three and five completely

3639
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:40,000
building a good competitive team is a lot

3640
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:42,000
of work but it's worth it when the game is new

3641
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:44,000
and my friends are playing it too

3642
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:46,000
SSG100Matt says Pokemon came out in 1998

3643
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:48,000
and I've been playing it since then I'm

3644
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:50,000
almost thirty which means I have played

3645
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:52,000
Pokemon for half my life

3646
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:54,000
I will get Pokemon Y when I finish

3647
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:56,000
Black 2 sigh

3648
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:58,000
and lastly Codeman I'm

3649
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:00,000
not sure about Pokemon I love

3650
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:02,000
the blue and red but I just can't add to

3651
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:04,000
it the huge amount of games I will have on the

3652
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:06,000
table already I will be picking up

3653
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:08,000
a 2DS so maybe then I'll try it

3654
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:10,000
for now probably not

3655
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:12,000
but I was a huge fan of the Pokemon anime

3656
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:14,000
it was fantastic so

3657
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:16,000
overwhelming Pokemon

3658
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:18,000
fans versus non

3659
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:20,000
Pokemon fans

3660
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:22,000
there

3661
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:24,000
and kind of even it sounded pretty even

3662
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:26,000
on who's picking up what starter so

3663
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:28,000
I will say this that for all the past

3664
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:30,000
ones that I have played I've

3665
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:32,000
always started with a fire type

3666
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:34,000
that's just been me Fennekin's super cute

3667
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:36,000
that's what team oh and

3668
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:38,000
to answer the question earlier in the show I am team

3669
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:40,000
Fennekin absolutely

3670
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:42,000
I have no idea what that is

3671
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:44,000
he's a little Firefox not to be confused

3672
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:46,000
with a popular web browser ok well if he's

3673
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:48,000
a fox and on fire maybe I have to get the game

3674
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:50,000
let me show you

3675
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:52,000
does it like fire

3676
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:54,000
oh my god that's fucking cute

3677
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:56,000
right

3678
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:58,000
that's Fennekin let me show you the others just to compare

3679
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:00,000
that's Fennekin do you remember when we went to that E3

3680
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:02,000
and I came back with all those damn Pokemon plushies

3681
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:04,000
like the plus and minus

3682
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:06,000
that's Chespin

3683
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:08,000
the grass type oh he looks angry

3684
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:10,000
in that particular picture he does here's a

3685
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:12,000
happy Chespin just to be fair

3686
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:14,000
there you go and uh

3687
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:16,000
here is

3688
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:18,000
fro-key

3689
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:20,000
looking that up right now ew no one gives a shit

3690
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:24,000
ok so we know it looks like an old

3691
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:26,000
like a frog with a beard on his back

3692
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:28,000
ok so Jamie is definitely

3693
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:30,000
not team fro-key

3694
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:34,000
Fennekin's cute I go with Fennekin

3695
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:36,000
even if I'm not getting the game I vote for

3696
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:38,000
Fennekin thank you

3697
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:40,000
thank you Dark Sakura who has a

3698
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:42,000
partially correct opinion

3699
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:44,000
hey

3700
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:46,000
yeah Act Deaf I had Plessy

3701
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:48,000
and Minun whoever

3702
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:50,000
but I gave them to my friend

3703
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:52,000
Julie because I don't care

3704
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:54,000

on those communities

3714
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:14,000
alright more long form news Loki

3715
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:16,000
starting us off

3716
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:18,000
alright so

3717
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:20,000
layoffs

3718
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:22,000
god you don't like them

3719
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:24,000
but it happens so there's a

3720
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:26,000
couple companies laying off people first off

3721
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:28,000
Sega of America is confirming

3722
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:30,000
an unspecific number of layoffs I'm assuming

3723
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:32,000
this is tying in with the fact

3724
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:34,000
that you know they are taking on Atlas

3725
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:36,000
and perhaps there's just

3726
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:38,000
you know

3727
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:40,000
some of those jobs kind of overlapping

3728
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:42,000
each other

3729
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:44,000
so basically

3730
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:46,000
as the gaming industry continues to

3731
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:48,000
evolve companies must adapt

3732
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:50,000
and adjust in order to compete and succeed

3733
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:52,000
in an ever changing environment as the

3734
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:54,000
result Sega of America has recently undergone

3735
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:56,000
a restructure that will enable the

3736
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:58,000
company to focus efficiently on developing

3737
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:00,000
new and existing content across

3738
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:02,000
digital platforms as well as continuing to focus

3739
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:04,000
on key brands for packaged goods

3740
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:06,000
alright

3741
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:08,000
so yeah

3742
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:10,000
and then

3743
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:12,000
Capcom well that sucks what else can you

3744
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:14,000
say I mean I know layoffs are kind of

3745
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:16,000
inevitable in this industry but it

3746
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:18,000
always makes you sad especially when it's like big companies

3747
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:20,000
like Sega you know yeah also

3748
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:22,000
Capcom Europe apparently is going

3749
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:24,000
to be laying off more than half of its staff

3750
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:26,000
and this

3751
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:28,000
is coming from I guess MCV

3752
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:30,000
who understands more than

3753
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:32,000
they're saying more than half of the

3754
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:34,000
firm faces redundancy with

3755
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:36,000
the number of jobs set to merge

3756
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:38,000
so

3757
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:40,000
that kind of sucks

3758
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:42,000
and I guess following a

3759
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:44,000
restructure in the US operation Capcom

3760
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:46,000
Europe organization is currently evaluating

3761
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:48,000
its structure to ensure it's

3762
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:50,000
in the best position to take advantage of the

3763
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:52,000
changing market condition the industry is facing

3764
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:54,000
in other words they're doing more digital stuff

3765
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:56,000
I believe because I think

3766
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:58,000
a lot of their

3767
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:00,000
you know a lot of franchises I mean they have franchises

3768
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:02,000
but there's not a ton of different franchises that they're

3769
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:04,000
kind of continually putting out games for

3770
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:06,000
well

3771
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:08,000
and just to say I want to address something too I see

3772
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:10,000
around the internet for those that are saying like

3773
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:12,000
you know good or that'll

3774
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:14,000
teach Capcom or you know

3775
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:16,000
Capcom deserved it or whatever

3776
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:18,000
like okay stop stop

3777
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:20,000
stop because the people being

3778
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:22,000
affected by these layoffs probably

3779
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:24,000
have nothing to do with the decisions that you don't like

3780
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:26,000
you know that's the way

3781
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:28,000
these things go unfortunately is that the people that are

3782
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:30,000
actually getting laid off are probably pretty hard working

3783
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:32,000
people that are just trying to make a good game

3784
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:34,000
and usually these types of decisions

3785
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:36,000
come from high up

3786
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:38,000
then you can start

3787
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:40,000
saying that you know well maybe it's

3788
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:42,000
for the best or whatever so

3789
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:44,000
yeah I just kind of want to get that out there

3790
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:46,000
like don't be all like well should've

3791
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:48,000
made the new Mega Man game because

3792
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:50,000
that's

3793
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:52,000
I mean while that may be true

3794
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:54,000
that's like laughing at somebody's

3795
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:56,000
face when they're going through tragedy you know

3796
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:58,000
did you see what the new Mega Man game was going to look like

3797
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:00,000
remember the leaked footage that

3798
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:02,000
came out of the cancelled Mega Man game

3799
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:04,000
yeah well the 3DS

3800
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:06,000
one didn't look bad at all

3801
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:08,000
too bad not enough people

3802
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:10,000
downloaded the demo or wait they didn't

3803
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:12,000
release that no they didn't

3804
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:14,000
so yeah but not enough people

3805
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:16,000
downloaded the demo because they never released it

3806
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:18,000
so yeah but

3807
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:20,000
are these layoff news about the people

3808
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:22,000
that made that decision probably not

3809
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:24,000
it's kind of the equivalent of not tipping

3810
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:26,000
your waitress because the food was shitty or

3811
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:28,000
you just didn't like it it's you know

3812
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:30,000
they're really they're just usually conveying

3813
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:32,000
it to you they have no say in it at all

3814
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:34,000
unless they spit in it oh yeah

3815
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:36,000
that would be yeah

3816
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:38,000
alright fair enough alright

3817
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:40,000
I have a story that's

3818
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:42,000
hopefully a little bit happier news this

3819
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:44,000
is something that you know

3820
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:46,000
ever since we saw Sony do this with

3821
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:48,000
the Playstation 3 and the Playstation Vita

3822
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:50,000
we've wondered if Nintendo

3823
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:52,000
might do something similar and that is cross by

3824
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:54,000
play which on Playstation 3

3825
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:56,000
is awesome because who doesn't like more

3826
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:58,000
games for more systems for free

3827
02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:00,000
games like sound shapes and

3828
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:02,000
Zen Pinball 2 they have the

3829
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:04,000
cross play available or if you buy it on

3830
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:06,000
the Playstation 3 you get a copy for the Vita as well

3831
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:08,000
well it was questioned

3832
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:10,000
of Dan Adelman who is a manager of business

3833
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:12,000
development at Nintendo

3834
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:14,000
will there be something about cross

3835
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:16,000
buy and quote we don't

3836
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:18,000
have anything new to announce on that but

3837
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:20,000
I believe that the idea has been talked about

3838
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:22,000
so if it's something we're definitely up to

3839
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:24,000
considering so it's something we're

3840
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:26,000
definitely up to considering

3841
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:28,000
that's not a non-committal answer I don't know what it is

3842
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:30,000
if there's enough demand from developers

3843
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:32,000
but nothing to announce for right now

3844
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:34,000
so that's interesting this will work

3845
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:36,000
in nicely when we announce our

3846
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:38,000
you know the brand new technology

3847
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:40,000
that we're putting in place to play 3DS

3848
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:42,000
games on the Wii U because then you'll

3849
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:44,000
buy your 3DS game and play it on

3850
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:46,000
your Wii U or on your 3DS

3851
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:48,000
because that's totally gonna fucking

3852
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:50,000
happen someday it might

3853
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:52,000
it's not a might it's an inevitably

3854
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:54,000
it's just gonna happen

3855
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:56,000
and then cross buy all the things

3856
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:58,000
but I can see where they might make that decision

3857
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:00,000
leave it up to developers though

3858
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:02,000
a developer has a right

3859
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:04,000
to double dip if they want even if it

3860
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:06,000
you know we don't like it and don't want to

3861
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:08,000
support it well a lot of time also

3862
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:10,000
with like the 3DS and the

3863
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:12,000
Wii U version it's gonna be two

3864
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:14,000
different developers on it because you have

3865
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:16,000
you know developers that'll do the handheld ports

3866
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:18,000
of games and then you'll have the console

3867
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:20,000
developers doing that sometimes it's the same team

3868
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:22,000
but a lot of times it can be two separate teams

3869
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:24,000
so you know it's

3870
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:26,000
why would you want to give

3871
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:28,000
something away for free considering that they're probably

3872
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:30,000
selling plenty of 3DS

3873
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:32,000
games and they need to sell more Wii U games

3874
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:34,000
so I don't know

3875
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:36,000
uh tiger claw on chat

3876
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:38,000
says what if they take cross buy a step further

3877
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:40,000
speaking on the Sony side now

3878
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:42,000
buy the Playstation 4 version and you get

3879
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:44,000
not only the Vita version but the PS3

3880
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:46,000
version too well we

3881
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:48,000
don't know enough about the Gaikai thing it doesn't

3882
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:50,000
sound like it's gonna be there at launch and if it will

3883
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:52,000
do the Playstation 3 games

3884
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:54,000
so I don't think we can assume that yet but

3885
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:56,000
um I

3886
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:58,000
I don't know like why would you go

3887
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:00,000
back and play the Playstation 3 version if you have a

3888
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:02,000
Playstation 4 version maybe I'm missing something

3889
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:04,000
but I would think the newer one would be

3890
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:06,000
a better experience but I mean I don't

3891
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:08,000
know I guess I could be wrong there are people that like

3892
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:10,000
retro but I'm like if it's the exact same game

3893
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:12,000
I don't know oh well

3894
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:14,000
anyhow

3895
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:16,000
uh let's move on

3896
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:18,000
more gaming news Dark Sakura

3897
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:20,000
we do have some other gaming news

3898
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:22,000
we have

3899
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:26,000
a game that

3900
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:28,000
I'm not any good at

3901
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:30,000
my husband's pretty good at it

3902
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:32,000
a lot of people are bitching about this

3903
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:34,000
too and I'll tell you why in a second

3904
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:36,000
but uh Ikaruga

3905
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:38,000
has hit the green light so Treasure's

3906
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:40,000
uh wonderful

3907
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:42,000
shooter game is going to be

3908
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:44,000
out for Steam

3909
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:46,000
and apparently though

3910
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:48,000
um while it's based

3911
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:50,000
off the Xbox 360

3912
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:52,000
version it is

3913
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:54,000
um

3914
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:56,000
going to have I think some different patterns

3915
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:58,000
from what I understand so basically

3916
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:00,000
people who had the old patterns memorized will have

3917
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:02,000
to learn new patterns all over again

3918
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:04,000
um so

3919
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:06,000
there's also a

3920
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:08,000
statement that came from Treasure on Twitter

3921
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:10,000
this is new challenge we are trying to distribute

3922
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:12,000
Treasure games on Steam

3923
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:14,000
so maybe we'll get Radiant Silver Gun next

3924
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:16,000
who knows

3925
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:20,000
it seems weird they have to go through

3926
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:22,000
Steam green light I mean it's Treasure

3927
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:24,000
why can't they just put the game on Steam

3928
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:26,000
why did they have to go through the green light process

3929
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:28,000
let's I mean

3930
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:30,000
maybe I'm not being fair here or whatever

3931
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:32,000
but it just seems like you know Treasure would be

3932
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:34,000
a big enough name that they kind of get to

3933
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:36,000
cut ahead for a game like Ikaruga

3934
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:38,000
and maybe they're also thinking

3935
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:40,000
we might maybe get something like Silhouette

3936
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:42,000
Mirage or Troublemakers or

3937
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:44,000
maybe they want to see what kind of support they're getting too

3938
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:46,000
I think green light actually is a really

3939
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:48,000
good way to gauge support because you have that whole

3940
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:50,000
voting system so true

3941
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:52,000
maybe they don't want to put the effort if

3942
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:54,000
there's not going to be enough people clamoring

3943
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:56,000
for it but Ikaruga has been

3944
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:58,000
popular enough I would love to have

3945
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:00,000
an accessible home version

3946
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:02,000
of Radiant Silver Gun that would be

3947
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:04,000
amazing

3948
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:06,000
alright let's move on

3949
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:08,000
so Microsoft is promising hey you know

3950
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:10,000
we got that brand new Kinect that's going to be

3951
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:12,000
coming out with the Xbox One and

3952
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:14,000
hey you know that they have that

3953
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:16,000
feature now that I guess it

3954
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:18,000
allows well the only thing

3955
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:20,000
this is really new because I think they have this for the

3956
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:22,000
Xbox 360 as well but it

3957
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:24,000
can be used in advertising

3958
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:26,000
like for example they're saying that

3959
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:28,000
Kinect actually recognizes

3960
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:30,000
expressions and engagement

3961
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:32,000
or can recognize people's faces

3962
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:34,000
that

3963
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:36,000
you know they could tell you know

3964
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:38,000
who's actually watching the ad or start

3965
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:40,000
you know targeting ads towards people and stuff

3966
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:42,000
and say hey listen you know

3967
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:44,000
just because it could be

3968
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:46,000
you know using that you know some of the new

3969
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:48,000
Xbox One Kinect fixtures

3970
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:50,000
could be used in advertising

3971
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:52,000
since we see expressions engagement

3972
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:54,000
etcetera and how that

3973
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:56,000
might be used to target advertising

3974
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:58,000
this is the point

3975
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:00,000
that seems to draw some controversy first

3976
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:02,000
nobody is working on that

3977
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:04,000
I'm not aware of any activity

3978
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:06,000
or any active work

3979
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:08,000
in this space second if something

3980
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:10,000
like that ever happened you can

3981
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:12,000
be sure that it wouldn't happen without

3982
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:14,000
the user having control over it period

3983
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:16,000
as they

3984
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:18,000
emphasize

3985
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:22,000
yeah but at the same time you know

3986
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:24,000
there's also all this controversy

3987
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:26,000
going on with the NSA and you know

3988
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:28,000
they're talking about people

3989
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:30,000
being spied on and

3990
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:32,000
Microsoft is the first to jump on board with

3991
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:34,000
supporting that kind of stuff

3992
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:36,000
when we first talked about the mandatory

3993
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:38,000
Kinect thing when all that E3

3994
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:40,000
shit blew up I said what a

3995
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:42,000
horrible time I think we all said

3996
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:44,000
what a horrible time for this to be happening with all the

3997
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:46,000
NSA stuff that's coming to light right now because that

3998
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:48,000
all also happened over the summer and it's like

3999
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:50,000
this is not going to help Microsoft's case

4000
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:52,000
to make the Kinect mandatory

4001
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:54,000
so I mean that thing needs

4002
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:56,000
to work and haven't they come out since

4003
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:58,000
it's been said it'll be fine if you unplug your Kinect

4004
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:00,000
they won 80 on that point didn't they

4005
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:02,000
yeah they did and honestly I don't see

4006
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:04,000
this as big a huge problem

4007
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:06,000
I mean because I mean I'm assuming

4008
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:08,000
I haven't really gotten a good peak

4009
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:10,000
at the interface and stuff but I'm assuming it's very

4010
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:12,000
similar like how the 360 is where

4011
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:14,000
you have those tiny little okay well there's

4012
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:16,000
let's be honest there's a lot of fucking ads

4013
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:18,000
on the 360 dashboard

4014
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:20,000
that really probably don't need to be there

4015
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:22,000
I mean come on Microsoft's been

4016
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:24,000
collecting money for these internet

4017
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:26,000
services and stuff and don't give me

4018
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:28,000
that oh sorry we need

4019
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:30,000
this extra ad revenue to you know

4020
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:32,000
cloud things or something I don't know

4021
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:34,000
whatever um

4022
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:36,000
but I just don't see the point that we need to

4023
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:38,000
have even ad people make

4024
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:40,000
like these interactive Kinect

4025
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:42,000
ads or something because who the fuck

4026
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:44,000
is really going to play that or actually

4027
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:46,000
you know half the people don't watch those ads

4028
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:48,000
anyways and who's going to really want

4029
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:50,000
to see an ad where like oh hey

4030
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:52,000
throw the mountain do it you know

4031
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:54,000
Jeff Gershman or whatever it is

4032
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:56,000
so I

4033
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:58,000
just

4034
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:00,000
Jason in chat says

4035
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:02,000
God get over the fucking NSA

4036
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:04,000
which you know

4037
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:06,000
despite all that political hub

4038
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:08,000
baloo it's not that

4039
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:10,000
honestly it's not really that that concerns me about the mandatory

4040
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:12,000
Kinect which is like you know the Kinect has the voice

4041
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:14,000
commands and everything right I just

4042
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:16,000
whether legit or

4043
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:18,000
not I am paranoid that that thing

4044
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:20,000
would capture a really

4045
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:22,000
unflattering picture in an inopportune

4046
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:24,000
or something or you know

4047
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:26,000
those things are going to be able to broadcast online and call

4048
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:28,000
people with voice commands and stuff so it's like

4049
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:30,000
hey I recognize Rob has the mountain do in front

4050
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:32,000
of him I'm going to take a picture look he's doing the do

4051
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:34,000
with underwear on

4052
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:38,000
the listeners thank you for that

4053
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:40,000
visual Loki but

4054
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:42,000
no for like for real like you know

4055
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:44,000
I'm I would my plan all along

4056
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:46,000
was just to turn the

4057
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:48,000
Kinect to face the wall when I'm not

4058
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:50,000
playing probably

4059
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:52,000
that's what I do with my current Kinect

4060
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:54,000
is just turn and face the TV or you know

4061
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:56,000
turn around the other way when I'm not playing and it's none

4062
02:16:56,000 --> 02:16:58,000
the wiser throw a shirt on it like poltergeist

4063
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:00,000
right yes that's a great

4064
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:02,000
answer too and then the Kinect's like

4065
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:04,000
hello are you still there

4066
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:06,000
there you

4067
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:08,000
are

4068
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:10,000
advertisements

4069
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:12,000
you know what I think

4070
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:14,000
would be fun is like make one

4071
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:16,000
of those little room boxes out

4072
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:18,000
of a shoebox you know a little stick figure people

4073
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:20,000
and then put it in front of the box

4074
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:22,000
just so that that's all it sees

4075
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:24,000
is the stick figure

4076
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:26,000
room box these people are really

4077
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:28,000
skinny and made of popsicle

4078
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:30,000
sticks like put like um

4079
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:32,000
like Halloween full

4080
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:34,000
people sitting on my couch

4081
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:36,000
so the Kinect thinks somebody's sitting on my

4082
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:38,000
couch 24 hours a day 7 days a week

4083
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:40,000
that somebody literally died on my couch

4084
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:42,000
you know what you get

4085
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:44,000
put a blow up doll on your couch

4086
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:46,000
and then that's all it sees

4087
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:48,000
wow

4088
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:50,000
a hardcore pornography

4089
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:52,000
alright

4090
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:54,000
we should just put a continuous loop

4091
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:56,000
video of Elizabeth Berkley

4092
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:58,000
doing the pool scene

4093
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:00,000
you don't know shit

4094
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:02,000
of course why are there so many

4095
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:04,000
showgirls references tonight

4096
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:06,000
not that I'm complaining alright

4097
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:08,000
well I think a lot of people are complaining about this

4098
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:10,000
Half Life 3

4099
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:12,000
was trademarked in Europe this week

4100
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:14,000
that's right

4101
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:16,000
the office for harmonization in the internal

4102
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:18,000
market or whatever that is

4103
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:20,000
in the European Union forgive my

4104
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:22,000
ignorance that's just an overseas

4105
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:24,000
agency

4106
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:26,000
trademarked Half Life 3 this week being owned

4107
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:28,000
by Valve Corporation

4108
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:30,000
the trademark covers computer game software

4109
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:32,000
it was filed on September 29th blah

4110
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:34,000
blah blah blah but

4111
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:36,000
it was fake y'all

4112
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:38,000
as sometimes happens with

4113
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:40,000
the trademarks this

4114
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:42,000
was a fake it was therefore

4115
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:44,000
removed from the trademark

4116
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:46,000
it was actually a part of the actual website

4117
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:48,000
or whatever the

4118
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:50,000
entrant disappeared completely

4119
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:52,000
and yeah it's

4120
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:54,000
it's not there anymore

4121
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:56,000
is this what we've come down to?

4122
02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:58,000
trolling with fake trademarks

4123
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:00,000
same thing happened in World of Warcraft

4124
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:02,000
same thing happens over there

4125
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:04,000
whatever

4126
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:06,000
you know what when Valve's ready

4127
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:08,000
they'll fucking say something

4128
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:10,000
to them

4129
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:12,000
it's happening soon

4130
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:14,000
so then you have a 1 in 300

4131
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:16,000
you have a

4132
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:18,000
300 opportunities to get a really nice PC

4133
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:20,000
in your house

4134
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:22,000
that's right that's the way I'm looking at it

4135
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:24,000
alright we'll see

4136
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:26,000
who plays Half Life 3 hey I guess that's a bonus

4137
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:28,000
hey Rob

4138
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:30,000
it's a fake

4139
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:32,000
yes it is

4140
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:34,000
alright let's get to the mailbag

4141
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:36,000
every week you kids email us

4142
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:38,000
and DarkSakura dives in the email

4143
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:40,000
bag head first and picks out a few of her

4144
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:42,000
favorite emails to read for you

4145
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:44,000
why do you have to tell everyone to send all those

4146
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:46,000
emails I know we got a lot this week

4147
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:48,000
thank you listeners

4148
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:50,000
I'm gonna be hilarious if Gabe Newell is just sitting over there

4149
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:52,000
he's like ah I'm gonna totally register that

4150
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:54,000
yep yep I just did it

4151
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:56,000
no I didn't hah

4152
02:19:56,000 --> 02:19:58,000
I totally fooled all those guys

4153
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:00,000
it's hilarious

4154
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:02,000
luckily Gabe Newell is not a troll like you

4155
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:04,000
you don't know that

4156
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:06,000
so I am super excited about Beyond Two Souls

4157
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:08,000
I loved Heavy Rain despite its flaws

4158
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:10,000
and from what I've played in the demo so far

4159
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:12,000
this game seems to have corrected a lot of the issues

4160
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:14,000
people complained about in that first game

4161
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:16,000
I wanted to talk about playing

4162
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:18,000
excuse me

4163
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:20,000
I want to talk about playing the game via this app called Beyond Touch

4164
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:22,000
sounds kinky

4165
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:24,000
they designed the game to be fully playable

4166
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:26,000
without a controller at all

4167
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:28,000
but with an app you can download for iOS and Android

4168
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:30,000
if you'd like to

4169
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:32,000
it sounds like it's an easier way to play

4170
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:34,000
is it more accessible for people who aren't traditional gamers

4171
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:36,000
this along with marketing the game

4172
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:38,000
like a movie and even premiering footage

4173
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:40,000
of the Tribeca Film Festival

4174
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:42,000
make me feel like they're really trying to

4175
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:44,000
make the game appeal to a wider audience

4176
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:46,000
do you think this could backfire?

4177
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:48,000
I guess it depends on which experience

4178
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:50,000
is the better one

4179
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:52,000
because I can see gamers getting upset

4180
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:54,000
but don't they always?

4181
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:56,000
if the traditional controller play is inferior to the app play

4182
02:20:56,000 --> 02:20:58,000
or is this just good business sense

4183
02:20:58,000 --> 02:21:00,000
and would you like to see more games do this?

4184
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:02,000
I think it's a good idea

4185
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:04,000
I think gamers are going to be pissed off anyway

4186
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:06,000
so it doesn't matter

4187
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:08,000
I think the point is

4188
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:10,000
the bottom line, making the money

4189
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:12,000
making the money means selling the game

4190
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:14,000
selling the games makes it accessible to more people

4191
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:16,000
so there you go

4192
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:18,000
that's my thought

4193
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:20,000
and also making these sort of apps

4194
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:22,000
that work with games

4195
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:24,000
are basically just a way to get people

4196
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:26,000
to talk about said game

4197
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:28,000
as we just did

4198
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:30,000
there's a lot of MMOs too

4199
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:32,000
like having the Warcraft app

4200
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:34,000
is a great example

4201
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:36,000
you can actually chat to your guild mates

4202
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:38,000
from the Warcraft app on the phone

4203
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:40,000
you can actually still be in the game

4204
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:42,000
while you're not playing the game

4205
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:44,000
there's been calls to make that enrichment even stronger

4206
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:46,000
but even non-MMO games had it

4207
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:48,000
Mass Effect had that little companion app

4208
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:50,000
that meant you didn't have to do multiplayer

4209
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:52,000
which I still sometimes use

4210
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:54,000
it's off the store by the way

4211
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:56,000
it's officially gone

4212
02:21:56,000 --> 02:21:58,000
that reminds me since

4213
02:21:58,000 --> 02:22:00,000
Microsoft came out with this wonderful app

4214
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:02,000
called Smart Glass last year

4215
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:04,000
as part of the Xbox 360 thing

4216
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:06,000
it's something that's going to be included in the Xbox One

4217
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:08,000
have they even shown anything that

4218
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:10,000
uses that yet?

4219
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:12,000
have they shown anything that's going to

4220
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:14,000
I think they were talking about enhancements

4221
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:16,000
for Xbox One

4222
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:18,000
but as far as the 360 is concerned

4223
02:22:18,000 --> 02:22:20,000
I think it's a lost cause

4224
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:22,000
I understand that, but I'm talking about the Xbox One

4225
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:24,000
have they even shown anything Smart Glass does?

4226
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:26,000
other than mention it, like, hey

4227
02:22:26,000 --> 02:22:28,000
these games are going to use Smart Glass

4228
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:30,000
because I know we've seen stuff with Watch Dogs

4229
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:32,000
and stuff like that, but they have their own dedicated apps

4230
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:34,000
for that thing, it's not really Smart Glass

4231
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:36,000
it's kind of this other thing

4232
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:38,000
so

4233
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:40,000
yeah, I thought the Halo 4 Smart Glass thing

4234
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:42,000
was great until I was like, oh, it's just another app

4235
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:44,000
in the store, alright, whatever

4236
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:46,000
so they just kind of

4237
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:48,000
I think it's meant more

4238
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:50,000
for movies

4239
02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:52,000
like being a second screen experience

4240
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:54,000
for movies and TV, but

4241
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:56,000
we'll see, I will admit

4242
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:58,000
TV on the Wii U

4243
02:22:58,000 --> 02:23:00,000
is kind of neat, and it's a bummer

4244
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:02,000
more people don't use it, it's kind of a neat

4245
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:04,000
little second screen experience where you can kind of chat with people

4246
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:06,000
as big shows are happening and stuff, but

4247
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:08,000
it would be neat if there was something like that

4248
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:10,000
on Xbox, but I don't know, we'll see

4249
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:12,000
alright, next email

4250
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:14,000
yes

4251
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:16,000
Hey, OLR, it's your friendly neighborhood turtle

4252
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:18,000
I wanted to share a quick, funny story

4253
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:20,000
my wife was downstairs last night cooking dinner

4254
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:22,000
when she heard me let out a shriek

4255
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:24,000
as if my soul was being ripped out

4256
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:26,000
she ran upstairs, concerned that I had hurt myself

4257
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:28,000
and found me laughing at myself playing

4258
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:30,000
Alan Wake. I was pretty embarrassed

4259
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:32,000
she had a good chuckle at that

4260
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:34,000
sorry, I'm laughing because I'm like

4261
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:36,000
what does one's soul being ripped out

4262
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:38,000
sound like? But then I thought

4263
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:40,000
back earlier in the show to that Pokemon

4264
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:42,000
fighting video somebody linked us to

4265
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:44,000
and I'm like, oh, it probably sounded like that

4266
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:46,000
Loki, can't wait for GTA 5

4267
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:48,000
to come out on PC, I refused to buy it twice

4268
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:50,000
and then this one's to me

4269
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:52,000
I hope that this week you aren't sick

4270
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:54,000
you know what?

4271
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:56,000
I'm not sick all the time

4272
02:23:56,000 --> 02:23:58,000
how are you feeling right now, you good?

4273
02:23:58,000 --> 02:24:00,000
allergies

4274
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:02,000
having allergies is not the same as being sick

4275
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:04,000
and granted

4276
02:24:04,000 --> 02:24:06,000
I also got stung by an asshole

4277
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:08,000
wasp

4278
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:10,000
which I'm sure Rachel will attest to

4279
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:12,000
I get pretty sick from

4280
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:14,000
waspies

4281
02:24:14,000 --> 02:24:16,000
it was at her house

4282
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:18,000
keep on being fabulous

4283
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:20,000
will do

4284
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:22,000
I look forward to downloading the podcast

4285
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:24,000
every Monday morning so I can listen to it while working

4286
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:26,000
keep up the good times, your loyal turtle

4287
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:28,000
in Philadelphia, serious turtle

4288
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:30,000
next email

4289
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:32,000
it's nice to know I'm not the only one that screams

4290
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:34,000
like crazy playing scary video games

4291
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:36,000
but nobody's as bad as Gamet

4292
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:38,000
y'all, I don't know if he's still listening, I just had to

4293
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:40,000
rez him you know what?

4294
02:24:40,000 --> 02:24:42,000
if a game scares me, I actually

4295
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:44,000
you've seen me on scary

4296
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:46,000
rides, I don't make a noise

4297
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:48,000
if I am truly freaked out

4298
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:50,000
or scared

4299
02:24:50,000 --> 02:24:52,000
I freeze up, get the big eyes

4300
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:54,000
and I am completely unable

4301
02:24:54,000 --> 02:24:56,000
to speak

4302
02:24:56,000 --> 02:24:58,000
the only time I rode tower of terror

4303
02:24:58,000 --> 02:25:00,000
I was literally mute

4304
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:02,000
for the next 30 minutes

4305
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:04,000
I could not speak

4306
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:06,000
note to self, get Jamie to ride

4307
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:08,000
tower of terror before OLR

4308
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:10,000
not even funny Rob

4309
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:12,000
oh come on, it's just a joke

4310
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:14,000
yeah but it's a real thing and it's horrible

4311
02:25:14,000 --> 02:25:16,000
so I will sit through

4312
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:18,000
a scary movie and just like

4313
02:25:18,000 --> 02:25:20,000
eyes wide open and won't say anything

4314
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:22,000
you know I'm scared if I haven't said shit

4315
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:26,000
next email

4316
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:28,000
hello OLR, although PS4 certainly has

4317
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:30,000
a very positive vibe about it, I was very

4318
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:32,000
compelled to buy a Playstation console for the first time

4319
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:34,000
I decided to get an Xbox One

4320
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:36,000
anyway, the reason might sound strange

4321
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:38,000
but it's Kinect that convinced me, I like

4322
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:40,000
the first Kinect a lot

4323
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:42,000
for several reasons

4324
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:44,000
for the first time I could play video games with everyone

4325
02:25:44,000 --> 02:25:46,000
around me, my girlfriend likes it and she's very good at it

4326
02:25:46,000 --> 02:25:48,000
kicking my virtual ass all the time

4327
02:25:48,000 --> 02:25:50,000
even my dad and mom play from time to time

4328
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:52,000
and they never played video games before

4329
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:54,000
everyone likes it because it's so simple to use

4330
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:56,000
even more simple than

4331
02:25:56,000 --> 02:25:58,000
Wii

4332
02:25:58,000 --> 02:26:00,000
or PS

4333
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:02,000
there must be a typo, or PS Move

4334
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:04,000
since no buttons are used at all

4335
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:06,000
also Kinect is a fresh wind and gaming that is needed

4336
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:08,000
it's something completely different

4337
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:10,000
than just another

4338
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:12,000
standard first person shooter

4339
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:16,000
that's why I don't get why Kinect gets all the hate

4340
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:18,000
because it sucks

4341
02:26:18,000 --> 02:26:20,000
mostly from so called hardcore gamers

4342
02:26:20,000 --> 02:26:22,000
sure it's not perfect at all

4343
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:24,000
and it has to prove itself a lot more

4344
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:26,000
that's why Kinect 2 needs to get it right this time

4345
02:26:26,000 --> 02:26:28,000
but I think that it's an important step forward

4346
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:30,000
in the general development of gaming

4347
02:26:30,000 --> 02:26:32,000
a step of which we don't understand

4348
02:26:32,000 --> 02:26:34,000
its importance yet

4349
02:26:34,000 --> 02:26:36,000
a step as important as the joystick

4350
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:38,000
or am I giving it too much credit?

4351
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:40,000
yes

4352
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:42,000
what if Kinect becomes well used and mainstream?

4353
02:26:42,000 --> 02:26:44,000
god I hope not

4354
02:26:44,000 --> 02:26:46,000
what would be the next step in gaming beyond that?

4355
02:26:46,000 --> 02:26:48,000
as always I'm very thankful for you guys making a podcast every week

4356
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:50,000
Fabrice from Belgium

4357
02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:52,000
and I am super opinionated about it

4358
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:54,000
I don't like the Kinect

4359
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:56,000
I don't have fun with the Kinect

4360
02:26:56,000 --> 02:26:58,000
I've never had fun with the Kinect

4361
02:26:58,000 --> 02:27:00,000
if I want to play something that's going to involve

4362
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:02,000
me using motion

4363
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:04,000
I want a peripheral

4364
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:06,000
I want my dance pads for DDR

4365
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:08,000
or my maracas for samba

4366
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:10,000
I want something that's going to be

4367
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:12,000
specifically related to the game

4368
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:14,000
that I'm playing

4369
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:16,000
I hated

4370
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:18,000
I don't like watching myself

4371
02:27:18,000 --> 02:27:20,000
maybe it's just a me thing

4372
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:22,000
but even though I had a lot of fun

4373
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:24,000
with Dance Masters

4374
02:27:24,000 --> 02:27:26,000
to do Para Para

4375
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:28,000
I could not watch the screen

4376
02:27:28,000 --> 02:27:30,000
if that made sense

4377
02:27:30,000 --> 02:27:32,000
I did all the stupid Para Para dances with my eyes closed

4378
02:27:32,000 --> 02:27:34,000
well you can also turn off your silhouettes in that game

4379
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:36,000
if you really want to

4380
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:38,000
well here's the thing about Kinect

4381
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:40,000
yeah I might razz on Kinect a little bit

4382
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:42,000
but I get that it's

4383
02:27:42,000 --> 02:27:44,000
super accessible

4384
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:46,000
and that people who don't even play a lot of games

4385
02:27:46,000 --> 02:27:48,000
will be like oh what's that dance game

4386
02:27:48,000 --> 02:27:50,000
oh that looks kind of neat I can do that

4387
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:52,000
I can just move and play the game

4388
02:27:52,000 --> 02:27:54,000
I get where it's highly accessible

4389
02:27:54,000 --> 02:27:56,000
but for me the thing that really bothers me about Kinect

4390
02:27:56,000 --> 02:27:58,000
is it's like the same three punchlines over and over

4391
02:27:58,000 --> 02:28:00,000
it's dance and fitness

4392
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:02,000
it's

4393
02:28:02,000 --> 02:28:04,000
or I should say it's dance games

4394
02:28:04,000 --> 02:28:06,000
it's fitness games

4395
02:28:06,000 --> 02:28:08,000
and once in a while other weird

4396
02:28:08,000 --> 02:28:10,000
voice integrations and things

4397
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:12,000
I haven't really seen a lot of Kinect games that made me go

4398
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:14,000
wow this is the future of gaming

4399
02:28:14,000 --> 02:28:16,000
a system is only as good as the games that are on it

4400
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:18,000
right?

4401
02:28:18,000 --> 02:28:20,000
and I thought maybe like Child of Eden

4402
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:22,000
that was kind of neat but that was like one game

4403
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:24,000
there hasn't been a lot that I feel

4404
02:28:24,000 --> 02:28:26,000
has really pushed gaming forward

4405
02:28:26,000 --> 02:28:28,000
which is why it really surprised me when they said

4406
02:28:28,000 --> 02:28:30,000
Xbox One is going to require it

4407
02:28:30,000 --> 02:28:32,000
and I'm like oh my god

4408
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:34,000
but this joke is dying fast

4409
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:36,000
if they're going to use the Kinect

4410
02:28:36,000 --> 02:28:38,000
they need to do Kinect plus Oculus Rift or something

4411
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:40,000
and maybe that would be real immersive

4412
02:28:40,000 --> 02:28:42,000
that might be a little scary

4413
02:28:42,000 --> 02:28:44,000
that would be lawn mower man

4414
02:28:44,000 --> 02:28:46,000
but still

4415
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:48,000
I personally have very little interest in it

4416
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:50,000
I usually play a game

4417
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:52,000
because it's my relaxing thing to do

4418
02:28:52,000 --> 02:28:54,000
I would rather go to the gym

4419
02:28:54,000 --> 02:28:56,000
if I was going to exercise

4420
02:28:56,000 --> 02:28:58,000
which I do anyway

4421
02:28:58,000 --> 02:29:00,000
so what's the point?

4422
02:29:00,000 --> 02:29:02,000
I saw a thing with the Kinect and the Oculus Rift

4423
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:04,000
and a stationary bike

4424
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:06,000
for the paperboy thing

4425
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:08,000
yeah I was going to say

4426
02:29:08,000 --> 02:29:10,000
I'm pretty sure those mods are out there

4427
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:12,000
because if you think about it

4428
02:29:12,000 --> 02:29:14,000
Oculus Rift, PC, Kinect

4429
02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:16,000
they have PC devices and things

4430
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:18,000
or drivers and things for that too

4431
02:29:18,000 --> 02:29:20,000
so it's out there

4432
02:29:20,000 --> 02:29:22,000
I'm sure it's probably a pain in the butt to develop for

4433
02:29:22,000 --> 02:29:24,000
Kinect always reminds me of

4434
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:26,000
it's in the book of Hitchhiker's Guide

4435
02:29:26,000 --> 02:29:28,000
because you can't really translate this into a movie

4436
02:29:28,000 --> 02:29:30,000
but it talks about how their society

4437
02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:32,000
goes from push button to touch screen

4438
02:29:32,000 --> 02:29:34,000
to Kinect like thing

4439
02:29:34,000 --> 02:29:36,000
and it finally ends up where Zefod Beelbrox

4440
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:38,000
is sitting on the bridge of Heart of Gold

4441
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:40,000
trying to listen to music

4442
02:29:40,000 --> 02:29:42,000
and you have to operate these systems

4443
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:44,000
you have to sit absolutely still

4444
02:29:44,000 --> 02:29:46,000
because any motion towards the console

4445
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:48,000
whatsoever is going to trigger

4446
02:29:48,000 --> 02:29:50,000
that to me seems like

4447
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:52,000
that's where we're going with this

4448
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:54,000
yeah I hear ya

4449
02:29:54,000 --> 02:29:56,000
I hear ya

4450
02:29:56,000 --> 02:29:58,000
alright so next email

4451
02:29:58,000 --> 02:30:00,000
god we still have four emails

4452
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:02,000
oh my god really?

4453
02:30:02,000 --> 02:30:04,000
Kiflom O.L.R. it's degenerate Johnny

4454
02:30:04,000 --> 02:30:06,000
it's a GTA 5 reference ask Loki what that means

4455
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:08,000
okay

4456
02:30:08,000 --> 02:30:10,000
is it wet now?

4457
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:12,000
Kiflom

4458
02:30:12,000 --> 02:30:14,000
oh yeah it's the

4459
02:30:14,000 --> 02:30:16,000
made up uh

4460
02:30:16,000 --> 02:30:18,000
Scientology um

4461
02:30:18,000 --> 02:30:20,000
it's what they say to each other

4462
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:22,000
I couldn't help but notice the argument

4463
02:30:22,000 --> 02:30:24,000
that wasn't really an argument

4464
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:26,000
that Jamie Loki had last week over their taste

4465
02:30:26,000 --> 02:30:28,000
in video games I'm often entertained

4466
02:30:28,000 --> 02:30:30,000
by your arguments but they sometimes

4467
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:32,000
have a tense feel about them just an observation

4468
02:30:32,000 --> 02:30:34,000
the beauty of interactive entertainment

4469
02:30:34,000 --> 02:30:36,000
is that there's a variety of good games that will

4470
02:30:36,000 --> 02:30:38,000
appeal to many but not to everyone

4471
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:40,000
it's for this reason why

4472
02:30:40,000 --> 02:30:42,000
Alan doesn't play Dead Space

4473
02:30:42,000 --> 02:30:44,000
why Bobby doesn't play shooters

4474
02:30:44,000 --> 02:30:46,000
why Rob doesn't play Cookie Clicker

4475
02:30:46,000 --> 02:30:48,000
that's not true

4476
02:30:48,000 --> 02:30:50,000
personally I don't

4477
02:30:50,000 --> 02:30:52,000
very much care for the Elder Scrolls series

4478
02:30:52,000 --> 02:30:54,000
melee combat and the first person perspective

4479
02:30:54,000 --> 02:30:56,000
doesn't work well for me

4480
02:30:56,000 --> 02:30:58,000
as an individual who appreciates both game series

4481
02:30:58,000 --> 02:31:00,000
I can see why one of the main problems between

4482
02:31:00,000 --> 02:31:02,000
Mass Effect and GTA

4483
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:04,000
involves a relationship between stories and gameplay

4484
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:06,000
I may be generalizing here but

4485
02:31:06,000 --> 02:31:08,000
Mass Effect's heavily involved story and dialogue

4486
02:31:08,000 --> 02:31:10,000
often gets in the way of the stellar gameplay

4487
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:12,000
I know

4488
02:31:12,000 --> 02:31:14,000
the dialogue can be skipped but

4489
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:16,000
some people just want to play the game

4490
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:18,000
the opposite can be said about GTA 5

4491
02:31:18,000 --> 02:31:20,000
the variety of side missions and extra

4492
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:22,000
activities in the game

4493
02:31:22,000 --> 02:31:24,000
can often

4494
02:31:24,000 --> 02:31:26,000
derail a game's superbly written stories

4495
02:31:26,000 --> 02:31:28,000
and that's what we call ooh a piece of candy

4496
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:30,000
factor in the end it's different

4497
02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:32,000
strokes for different folks

4498
02:31:32,000 --> 02:31:34,000
I didn't think it was an argument was it?

4499
02:31:34,000 --> 02:31:36,000
there was definitely

4500
02:31:36,000 --> 02:31:38,000
a heated discussion

4501
02:31:38,000 --> 02:31:40,000
on last week's show but I don't

4502
02:31:40,000 --> 02:31:42,000
think that was arguing so much as it was

4503
02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:44,000
passionate viewpoints and

4504
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:46,000
don't mistake the two because

4505
02:31:46,000 --> 02:31:48,000
hello we've been doing this show

4506
02:31:48,000 --> 02:31:50,000
11 and a half years do you think

4507
02:31:50,000 --> 02:31:52,000
yes we're going to get a little heated

4508
02:31:52,000 --> 02:31:54,000
when we disagree on topics sometimes

4509
02:31:54,000 --> 02:31:56,000
Rob I disagree with you all the time

4510
02:31:56,000 --> 02:31:58,000
fuck off I'm just kidding

4511
02:31:58,000 --> 02:32:00,000
you know I love you

4512
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:02,000
and we've been doing this a very long time

4513
02:32:02,000 --> 02:32:04,000
so of course there's going to be opinions

4514
02:32:04,000 --> 02:32:06,000
there's a little bit of stubbornness that comes

4515
02:32:06,000 --> 02:32:08,000
with that passion but I think everybody here on the show

4516
02:32:08,000 --> 02:32:10,000
is stubborn to a point

4517
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:12,000
yes we're very set in our ways

4518
02:32:12,000 --> 02:32:14,000
but when there's a good

4519
02:32:14,000 --> 02:32:16,000
viewpoint expressed

4520
02:32:16,000 --> 02:32:18,000
I don't think any of us are beyond saying

4521
02:32:18,000 --> 02:32:20,000
I disagree with you

4522
02:32:20,000 --> 02:32:22,000
but I hear what you're saying

4523
02:32:22,000 --> 02:32:24,000
yeah I got a little heated last week

4524
02:32:24,000 --> 02:32:26,000
but there's definitely

4525
02:32:26,000 --> 02:32:28,000
some deep rooted issues

4526
02:32:28,000 --> 02:32:30,000
that Grand Theft Auto 5 makes us face

4527
02:32:30,000 --> 02:32:32,000
that people are passionate about

4528
02:32:32,000 --> 02:32:34,000
for a very good reason

4529
02:32:34,000 --> 02:32:36,000
the next part of the email

4530
02:32:36,000 --> 02:32:38,000
I also want to address the misconception of the

4531
02:32:38,000 --> 02:32:40,000
GTA series having a misogynistic

4532
02:32:40,000 --> 02:32:42,000
atmosphere even though GTA

4533
02:32:42,000 --> 02:32:44,000
has often been littered with prostitutes and

4534
02:32:44,000 --> 02:32:46,000
strippers the game series has had

4535
02:32:46,000 --> 02:32:48,000
a variety of strong female characters

4536
02:32:48,000 --> 02:32:50,000
dating back to GTA 3

4537
02:32:50,000 --> 02:32:52,000
I'm going to go ahead and say this having a few

4538
02:32:52,000 --> 02:32:54,000
strong female characters does not make up

4539
02:32:54,000 --> 02:32:56,000
for misogyny just saying

4540
02:32:56,000 --> 02:32:58,000
the one thing about the GTA

4541
02:32:58,000 --> 02:33:00,000
series is that it plays the role

4542
02:33:00,000 --> 02:33:02,000
of social commentator in the world we live

4543
02:33:02,000 --> 02:33:04,000
in today i.e. life provider

4544
02:33:04,000 --> 02:33:06,000
equals Facebook medical cocaine

4545
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:08,000
equals marijuana

4546
02:33:08,000 --> 02:33:10,000
GTA 5 is no exception to this because it often

4547
02:33:10,000 --> 02:33:12,000
has commented against our patriarchal

4548
02:33:12,000 --> 02:33:14,000
society throughout the game

4549
02:33:14,000 --> 02:33:16,000
even though there is yet to be

4550
02:33:16,000 --> 02:33:18,000
a lead female character in the GTA

4551
02:33:18,000 --> 02:33:20,000
series GTA 5 has strong female characters

4552
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:22,000
throughout the story one such example

4553
02:33:22,000 --> 02:33:24,000
is

4554
02:33:24,000 --> 02:33:26,000
I'm trying to get to this is female crew

4555
02:33:26,000 --> 02:33:28,000
members that you can select for heists

4556
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:30,000
many of the

4557
02:33:30,000 --> 02:33:32,000
most skilled crew recruits are women and they

4558
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:34,000
know it which is why they get a higher take from

4559
02:33:34,000 --> 02:33:36,000
jobs than the male crew recruits

4560
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:38,000
not to mention GTA

4561
02:33:38,000 --> 02:33:40,000
Online offers the option for you to be a

4562
02:33:40,000 --> 02:33:42,000
woman with that being said maybe sometime

4563
02:33:42,000 --> 02:33:44,000
in the future we could expect Jamie to join the

4564
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:46,000
VoG crew to take down the patriarchal douche bags

4565
02:33:46,000 --> 02:33:48,000
and infest the online community I'm actually

4566
02:33:48,000 --> 02:33:50,000
already working on something for that but more later

4567
02:33:50,000 --> 02:33:52,000
anyways

4568
02:33:52,000 --> 02:33:54,000
as an individual who has a significant appreciation

4569
02:33:54,000 --> 02:33:56,000
for strong women in video games

4570
02:33:56,000 --> 02:33:58,000
the KOTOR series Final Fantasy 12

4571
02:33:58,000 --> 02:34:00,000
Mirrors Edge I just wanted to add in my

4572
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:02,000
two cents sincerely degenerate Johnny

4573
02:34:02,000 --> 02:34:04,000
I think what my problem

4574
02:34:04,000 --> 02:34:06,000
is more with the

4575
02:34:06,000 --> 02:34:08,000
misogynistic presentation

4576
02:34:08,000 --> 02:34:10,000
in the game is the fact that it

4577
02:34:10,000 --> 02:34:12,000
is coming from

4578
02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:14,000
real life

4579
02:34:14,000 --> 02:34:16,000
that it's an aspect of

4580
02:34:16,000 --> 02:34:18,000
real life that seems to be

4581
02:34:20,000 --> 02:34:22,000
almost

4582
02:34:22,000 --> 02:34:24,000
an ingrained part of culture

4583
02:34:24,000 --> 02:34:26,000
that shouldn't be

4584
02:34:26,000 --> 02:34:28,000
that we should strive to be better than

4585
02:34:28,000 --> 02:34:30,000
I have to make a tough

4586
02:34:30,000 --> 02:34:32,000
counterpoint though or at least I see it as one though

4587
02:34:32,000 --> 02:34:34,000
that isn't the point of Grand Theft Auto

4588
02:34:34,000 --> 02:34:36,000
and I kind of see it in this email too

4589
02:34:36,000 --> 02:34:38,000
isn't the point of Grand Theft Auto to be

4590
02:34:38,000 --> 02:34:40,000
over the top and silly

4591
02:34:40,000 --> 02:34:42,000
and ridiculous so yes

4592
02:34:42,000 --> 02:34:44,000
there's misogyny but it is presented

4593
02:34:44,000 --> 02:34:46,000
very tongue in cheek that maybe

4594
02:34:46,000 --> 02:34:48,000
people and I'm gonna

4595
02:34:48,000 --> 02:34:50,000
use something you've said on the show before

4596
02:34:50,000 --> 02:34:52,000
maybe people are looking to be offended

4597
02:34:52,000 --> 02:34:54,000
is it possible?

4598
02:34:54,000 --> 02:34:56,000
I

4599
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:02,000
I think

4600
02:35:02,000 --> 02:35:04,000
it's not necessarily just a matter of looking

4601
02:35:04,000 --> 02:35:06,000
to be offended people are going to

4602
02:35:06,000 --> 02:35:08,000
be offended as a reaction

4603
02:35:08,000 --> 02:35:10,000
and as I've often

4604
02:35:10,000 --> 02:35:12,000
said not necessarily on the show

4605
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:14,000
but in real life

4606
02:35:14,000 --> 02:35:16,000
you can't necessarily help

4607
02:35:16,000 --> 02:35:18,000
a reaction you can help

4608
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:20,000
by acting instead of acting

4609
02:35:20,000 --> 02:35:22,000
on your reaction so

4610
02:35:22,000 --> 02:35:24,000
I think that the problem being

4611
02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:26,000
is that illustrating that

4612
02:35:26,000 --> 02:35:28,000
yeah this is a part of society

4613
02:35:28,000 --> 02:35:30,000
the fact

4614
02:35:30,000 --> 02:35:32,000
that it has to be something that's brought

4615
02:35:32,000 --> 02:35:34,000
up in a game to be a realistic

4616
02:35:34,000 --> 02:35:36,000
parody means that something that needs

4617
02:35:36,000 --> 02:35:38,000
more attention to be combated if that

4618
02:35:38,000 --> 02:35:40,000
makes sense. Yeah

4619
02:35:40,000 --> 02:35:42,000
it's something to think about

4620
02:35:42,000 --> 02:35:44,000
and I mean and you know

4621
02:35:44,000 --> 02:35:46,000
honestly it was a big turn off for me

4622
02:35:46,000 --> 02:35:48,000
in trying to play the game

4623
02:35:48,000 --> 02:35:50,000
I've sat and watched a bunch

4624
02:35:50,000 --> 02:35:52,000
of the missions in the game while Dan played because

4625
02:35:52,000 --> 02:35:54,000
I could not touch

4626
02:35:54,000 --> 02:35:56,000
the PS3 any time

4627
02:35:56,000 --> 02:35:58,000
Dan was home because he was always

4628
02:35:58,000 --> 02:36:00,000
playing that game and I watched

4629
02:36:00,000 --> 02:36:02,000
a lot of it but after a while there's just like

4630
02:36:02,000 --> 02:36:04,000
so much you can

4631
02:36:04,000 --> 02:36:06,000
take before you're like

4632
02:36:06,000 --> 02:36:08,000
wow I've hit my saturation point I

4633
02:36:08,000 --> 02:36:10,000
feel really

4634
02:36:10,000 --> 02:36:12,000
down

4635
02:36:12,000 --> 02:36:14,000
you know

4636
02:36:14,000 --> 02:36:16,000
it's a really

4637
02:36:16,000 --> 02:36:18,000
hard thing to put a finger on because

4638
02:36:18,000 --> 02:36:20,000
I think I'm hearing that maybe the problem

4639
02:36:20,000 --> 02:36:22,000
is that like okay yeah the joke

4640
02:36:22,000 --> 02:36:24,000
is funny the first 500 times

4641
02:36:24,000 --> 02:36:26,000
yeah but there's only so much

4642
02:36:26,000 --> 02:36:28,000
you want to hear

4643
02:36:28,000 --> 02:36:30,000
derogatory terms being used toward women

4644
02:36:30,000 --> 02:36:32,000
even if it's done in a parody

4645
02:36:32,000 --> 02:36:34,000
since after a while it really does

4646
02:36:34,000 --> 02:36:36,000
stop being funny. Chell wants to chime

4647
02:36:36,000 --> 02:36:38,000
in here. I think this is

4648
02:36:38,000 --> 02:36:40,000
you know if we are going along the lines of GTA

4649
02:36:40,000 --> 02:36:42,000
as a big over the top parody is

4650
02:36:42,000 --> 02:36:44,000
it sounds like it's kind of falling prey to

4651
02:36:44,000 --> 02:36:46,000
Dave Chappelle syndrome where

4652
02:36:46,000 --> 02:36:48,000
after a certain point he stopped doing the show

4653
02:36:48,000 --> 02:36:50,000
because he realized the wrong people

4654
02:36:50,000 --> 02:36:52,000
were laughing at his jokes because

4655
02:36:52,000 --> 02:36:54,000
there's only so far you can go with ironic racism

4656
02:36:54,000 --> 02:36:56,000
before it just loops around and becomes

4657
02:36:56,000 --> 02:36:58,000
good old fashioned racism

4658
02:36:58,000 --> 02:37:00,000
and that seems like what's

4659
02:37:00,000 --> 02:37:02,000
happening a bit here you know the parody is getting

4660
02:37:02,000 --> 02:37:04,000
too close to the truth and

4661
02:37:04,000 --> 02:37:06,000
it's you know it stops

4662
02:37:06,000 --> 02:37:08,000
being funny for some people like

4663
02:37:08,000 --> 02:37:10,000
it's my two cents

4664
02:37:10,000 --> 02:37:12,000
I actually fully agree with that

4665
02:37:12,000 --> 02:37:14,000
that is

4666
02:37:14,000 --> 02:37:16,000
on the money.

4667
02:37:16,000 --> 02:37:18,000
Alright well in the interest of time I'm going to ask Jamie to go to the next

4668
02:37:18,000 --> 02:37:20,000
email but keep those emails coming on

4669
02:37:20,000 --> 02:37:22,000
this topic or tweets

4670
02:37:22,000 --> 02:37:24,000
mailbag at orangelandradio.com or twitter.com

4671
02:37:24,000 --> 02:37:26,000
slash o-l-r

4672
02:37:26,000 --> 02:37:28,000
Well since Ragenator just told me to skip

4673
02:37:28,000 --> 02:37:30,000
his email I'm skipping it

4674
02:37:30,000 --> 02:37:32,000
sorry

4675
02:37:32,000 --> 02:37:34,000
I don't know I might go back to it. Roll it over next week

4676
02:37:34,000 --> 02:37:36,000
I guess. God this one's

4677
02:37:36,000 --> 02:37:38,000
long too.

4678
02:37:38,000 --> 02:37:40,000
No I mean it's fucking really fucking

4679
02:37:40,000 --> 02:37:42,000
long. It's from Ralston UT

4680
02:37:42,000 --> 02:37:44,000
oh

4681
02:37:44,000 --> 02:37:46,000
no it's

4682
02:37:46,000 --> 02:37:48,000
really okay I'm gonna

4683
02:37:48,000 --> 02:37:50,000
go for it.

4684
02:37:50,000 --> 02:37:52,000
Can we try to get a TLDR

4685
02:37:52,000 --> 02:37:54,000
version of it?

4686
02:37:54,000 --> 02:37:56,000
Just for time's sake. I'm gonna just read the first

4687
02:37:56,000 --> 02:37:58,000
paragraph because it has to do with what we just

4688
02:37:58,000 --> 02:38:00,000
talked about. Here's my suggestion you go to the next email

4689
02:38:00,000 --> 02:38:02,000
I'll read I'll skim this email

4690
02:38:02,000 --> 02:38:04,000
and try to pick out the key points.

4691
02:38:04,000 --> 02:38:06,000
Hey o-l-r gang as I typically

4692
02:38:06,000 --> 02:38:08,000
save this show for my commute 2 plus hours

4693
02:38:08,000 --> 02:38:10,000
a day I don't have much opportunity to call

4694
02:38:10,000 --> 02:38:12,000
into the show. I noticed that the mailbag

4695
02:38:12,000 --> 02:38:14,000
has been fairly empty lately so

4696
02:38:14,000 --> 02:38:16,000
I had a suggestion why not address comments

4697
02:38:16,000 --> 02:38:18,000
from the podcast entries on the vog network page

4698
02:38:18,000 --> 02:38:20,000
as well. By the way

4699
02:38:20,000 --> 02:38:22,000
I'm well into my first playthrough of Mass Effect

4700
02:38:22,000 --> 02:38:24,000
2 just in case there wasn't a requisite mention

4701
02:38:24,000 --> 02:38:26,000
of Mass Effect elsewhere in the show.

4702
02:38:26,000 --> 02:38:28,000
I've also been playing Dragon

4703
02:38:28,000 --> 02:38:30,000
Fantasy Book 1 on my PS Vita which

4704
02:38:30,000 --> 02:38:32,000
is hilariously old school 8 bit RPG

4705
02:38:32,000 --> 02:38:34,000
in tradition of the early Dragon

4706
02:38:34,000 --> 02:38:36,000
Quest games. Until next time

4707
02:38:36,000 --> 02:38:38,000
John K. Critical Myth

4708
02:38:38,000 --> 02:38:40,000
Great question from Critical Myth

4709
02:38:40,000 --> 02:38:42,000
we do try to incorporate the

4710
02:38:42,000 --> 02:38:44,000
vog network comics

4711
02:38:44,000 --> 02:38:46,000
comments especially on a slower

4712
02:38:46,000 --> 02:38:48,000
news week but we haven't done them

4713
02:38:48,000 --> 02:38:50,000
in a while to be fair and I might actually

4714
02:38:50,000 --> 02:38:52,000
be confusing with Horde House because I know we do

4715
02:38:52,000 --> 02:38:54,000
vog comments more often over there but

4716
02:38:54,000 --> 02:38:56,000
certainly I mean the thing

4717
02:38:56,000 --> 02:38:58,000
about the vog comments I tend to

4718
02:38:58,000 --> 02:39:00,000
just respond to them on the spot

4719
02:39:00,000 --> 02:39:02,000
like when I see those comments I can't

4720
02:39:02,000 --> 02:39:04,000
wait for Sunday I just have to respond

4721
02:39:04,000 --> 02:39:06,000
on the spot so if you want to get something

4722
02:39:06,000 --> 02:39:08,000
right away the vog comments are the

4723
02:39:08,000 --> 02:39:10,000
place to go but if there's like a really good

4724
02:39:10,000 --> 02:39:12,000
point or counterpoint or something

4725
02:39:12,000 --> 02:39:14,000
brought up it's gonna come to the show

4726
02:39:14,000 --> 02:39:16,000
one way or another. I'm gonna inevitably

4727
02:39:16,000 --> 02:39:18,000
say yeah somebody was posting about this on vog

4728
02:39:18,000 --> 02:39:20,000
you know. Well while you're back

4729
02:39:20,000 --> 02:39:22,000
to scanning that one I'll read

4730
02:39:22,000 --> 02:39:24,000
Raginator's

4731
02:39:24,000 --> 02:39:26,000
email. Okay you got it. Since it's short

4732
02:39:26,000 --> 02:39:28,000
Hi all this is everyone's favorite email

4733
02:39:28,000 --> 02:39:30,000
or hero to many and a total amazing all

4734
02:39:30,000 --> 02:39:32,000
around guy Raginator.

4735
02:39:32,000 --> 02:39:34,000
Hey it was on the email

4736
02:39:34,000 --> 02:39:36,000
so I said it. I just thought

4737
02:39:36,000 --> 02:39:38,000
I'd pose a little food for thought this week

4738
02:39:38,000 --> 02:39:40,000
it's fairly common knowledge that I've

4739
02:39:40,000 --> 02:39:42,000
traditionally been a console gamer since 1981

4740
02:39:42,000 --> 02:39:44,000
and it wasn't until after

4741
02:39:44,000 --> 02:39:46,000
last year's break in my moving and the replacement

4742
02:39:46,000 --> 02:39:48,000
of my computer where I actually started playing PC

4743
02:39:48,000 --> 02:39:50,000
games albeit reluctantly at first

4744
02:39:50,000 --> 02:39:52,000
as late as

4745
02:39:52,000 --> 02:39:54,000
August 2012 I would have scoffed at the notion

4746
02:39:54,000 --> 02:39:56,000
of PC gaming having been a console fan

4747
02:39:56,000 --> 02:39:58,000
boy for the better part of my life.

4748
02:39:58,000 --> 02:40:00,000
Now that I've been on Steam for a while now

4749
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:02,000
plus having played Diablo 2 as well

4750
02:40:02,000 --> 02:40:04,000
I'm quite thoroughly enjoying PC gaming.

4751
02:40:04,000 --> 02:40:06,000
I also as of late

4752
02:40:06,000 --> 02:40:08,000
been questioning whether or not I

4753
02:40:08,000 --> 02:40:10,000
really need to replace my PS3.

4754
02:40:10,000 --> 02:40:12,000
That being said I'd like to pose

4755
02:40:12,000 --> 02:40:14,000
this question. Have any of you been in a

4756
02:40:14,000 --> 02:40:16,000
situation where you enjoyed X so much

4757
02:40:16,000 --> 02:40:18,000
do you question whether or not to replace Y?

4758
02:40:18,000 --> 02:40:20,000
This email has been brought to you by

4759
02:40:20,000 --> 02:40:22,000
the clearly superior Japanese soundtrack

4760
02:40:22,000 --> 02:40:24,000
Japanese version of the Sonic CD soundtrack

4761
02:40:24,000 --> 02:40:26,000
the US version is just lame y'all better recognize

4762
02:40:26,000 --> 02:40:28,000
for the record I don't think it's

4763
02:40:28,000 --> 02:40:30,000
lame I just think the Japanese music

4764
02:40:30,000 --> 02:40:32,000
is better. Thank you

4765
02:40:32,000 --> 02:40:34,000
that's the same thing I say about Chrono Trigger and Super Metroid

4766
02:40:34,000 --> 02:40:36,000
I'm like I'm not saying Chrono Trigger is bad

4767
02:40:36,000 --> 02:40:38,000
I'm not.

4768
02:40:38,000 --> 02:40:40,000
In fact it's better than good

4769
02:40:40,000 --> 02:40:42,000
but it's just

4770
02:40:42,000 --> 02:40:44,000
Super Metroid is like top tier. It's better than bad

4771
02:40:44,000 --> 02:40:46,000
it's good? Sure.

4772
02:40:46,000 --> 02:40:48,000
And I'm gonna say this I've never

4773
02:40:48,000 --> 02:40:50,000
been in that situation because I

4774
02:40:50,000 --> 02:40:52,000
mean shit I probably have

4775
02:40:52,000 --> 02:40:54,000
just about every video game system

4776
02:40:54,000 --> 02:40:56,000
that's worth owning.

4777
02:40:56,000 --> 02:40:58,000
I've never been in that situation

4778
02:40:58,000 --> 02:41:00,000
that I you know

4779
02:41:00,000 --> 02:41:02,000
now I've had games that

4780
02:41:02,000 --> 02:41:04,000
like for example Dragon Ball

4781
02:41:04,000 --> 02:41:06,000
GT Final Battle when I owned that game

4782
02:41:06,000 --> 02:41:08,000
it was worth a lot of money. I traded it for Blue Stinger

4783
02:41:08,000 --> 02:41:10,000
I've never regretted it. Even though

4784
02:41:10,000 --> 02:41:12,000
I can get that game any number of ways

4785
02:41:12,000 --> 02:41:14,000
now I don't

4786
02:41:14,000 --> 02:41:16,000
care. It's not that

4787
02:41:16,000 --> 02:41:18,000
great of a game and I'm totally not into

4788
02:41:18,000 --> 02:41:20,000
Dragon Ball that much anymore

4789
02:41:20,000 --> 02:41:22,000
unless I'm like watching the old school stuff.

4790
02:41:22,000 --> 02:41:24,000
Alright

4791
02:41:24,000 --> 02:41:26,000
I am gonna try to tackle this email from

4792
02:41:26,000 --> 02:41:28,000
RossDielUT and I'm gonna shorten it

4793
02:41:28,000 --> 02:41:30,000
so I apologize to RossDielUT in that

4794
02:41:30,000 --> 02:41:32,000
regard but it is a very long letter

4795
02:41:32,000 --> 02:41:34,000
and we're already at 9 o'clock and we gotta wrap up

4796
02:41:34,000 --> 02:41:36,000
we still have to get calls and wrap the show so

4797
02:41:36,000 --> 02:41:38,000
Do you think it'd be possible we can allow it to be reposted on the forums?

4798
02:41:38,000 --> 02:41:40,000
No I would want his permission for that so

4799
02:41:40,000 --> 02:41:42,000
Why doesn't we ask him to post it on the forum?

4800
02:41:42,000 --> 02:41:44,000
Yeah so but let me get

4801
02:41:44,000 --> 02:41:46,000
some of the stuff because first it starts off with

4802
02:41:46,000 --> 02:41:48,000
a couple paragraphs about the whole Grand Theft Auto 5

4803
02:41:48,000 --> 02:41:50,000
thing so he says

4804
02:41:50,000 --> 02:41:52,000
I thought it explained to Loki why the casual

4805
02:41:52,000 --> 02:41:54,000
sexism, racism, and homo-transphobia in Grand Theft

4806
02:41:54,000 --> 02:41:56,000
Auto 5 is offensive to people.

4807
02:41:56,000 --> 02:41:58,000
I firmly agree that not every game needs a female

4808
02:41:58,000 --> 02:42:00,000
lead. There's plenty of room

4809
02:42:00,000 --> 02:42:02,000
in the space between lead character and joke

4810
02:42:02,000 --> 02:42:04,000
character. When a group that you're in is

4811
02:42:04,000 --> 02:42:06,000
exclusively depicted in an offensive manner

4812
02:42:06,000 --> 02:42:08,000
that's not going to be fun. Vice City

4813
02:42:08,000 --> 02:42:10,000
put that into focus for me as a Cuban American

4814
02:42:10,000 --> 02:42:12,000
who went to school with more than a few Haitian

4815
02:42:12,000 --> 02:42:14,000
American in his day. The gangs were simply identified

4816
02:42:14,000 --> 02:42:16,000
by race and all the characters were racist

4817
02:42:16,000 --> 02:42:18,000
cardboard cutouts. Compare that to games

4818
02:42:18,000 --> 02:42:20,000
based around the Clancyverse. The main protagonist

4819
02:42:20,000 --> 02:42:22,000
tends to be a white dude but women and other

4820
02:42:22,000 --> 02:42:24,000
races are treated with respect and are never

4821
02:42:24,000 --> 02:42:26,000
relegated to the sidelines.

4822
02:42:26,000 --> 02:42:28,000
Both GTA and the

4823
02:42:28,000 --> 02:42:30,000
Clancy games are plainly aimed at

4824
02:42:30,000 --> 02:42:32,000
the male demographic but the latter does so

4825
02:42:32,000 --> 02:42:34,000
in a manner that respects minorities and women

4826
02:42:34,000 --> 02:42:36,000
while the former makes jokes out of them.

4827
02:42:36,000 --> 02:42:38,000
This isn't to say Rockstar should be forbidden

4828
02:42:38,000 --> 02:42:40,000
to do what they do. I'm a big proponent of

4829
02:42:40,000 --> 02:42:42,000
free speech. However that free speech

4830
02:42:42,000 --> 02:42:44,000
goes both ways and if Rockstar

4831
02:42:44,000 --> 02:42:46,000
wants to continue to take the cardboard cutout approach

4832
02:42:46,000 --> 02:42:48,000
to their characters and rely exclusively on

4833
02:42:48,000 --> 02:42:50,000
negative stereotypes they should be ready to be

4834
02:42:50,000 --> 02:42:52,000
called out on it. In fact I don't think Rockstar

4835
02:42:52,000 --> 02:42:54,000
cares as they've been relying on cheap

4836
02:42:54,000 --> 02:42:56,000
headline-grabbing garbage to sell Grand Theft Auto

4837
02:42:56,000 --> 02:42:58,000
for years now. Solving the problem

4838
02:42:58,000 --> 02:43:00,000
might lead to less sales so why stop

4839
02:43:00,000 --> 02:43:02,000
degrading women and minorities?

4840
02:43:02,000 --> 02:43:04,000
I think

4841
02:43:04,000 --> 02:43:06,000
I'm a little

4842
02:43:06,000 --> 02:43:08,000
bit with you Ross Deal UT until like your last

4843
02:43:08,000 --> 02:43:10,000
two sentences and the reason for

4844
02:43:10,000 --> 02:43:12,000
that is that I think you're also kind of dismissing

4845
02:43:12,000 --> 02:43:14,000
why that quite

4846
02:43:14,000 --> 02:43:16,000
possibly there are people that are drawn to Grand Theft Auto

4847
02:43:16,000 --> 02:43:18,000
because it's a good game

4848
02:43:18,000 --> 02:43:20,000
outside the story. Like I kind of think

4849
02:43:20,000 --> 02:43:22,000
for Loki, I don't mean to put

4850
02:43:22,000 --> 02:43:24,000
words in your mouth but I always got the sense

4851
02:43:24,000 --> 02:43:26,000
you're an open world explorer do your

4852
02:43:26,000 --> 02:43:28,000
own thing kind of guy. That's what you

4853
02:43:28,000 --> 02:43:30,000
like out of Grand Theft Auto way more than

4854
02:43:30,000 --> 02:43:32,000
the story. I would say that there's a lot more

4855
02:43:32,000 --> 02:43:34,000
depth that's been put in place

4856
02:43:34,000 --> 02:43:36,000
aside from Vice City

4857
02:43:36,000 --> 02:43:38,000
what came out in 2002

4858
02:43:38,000 --> 02:43:40,000
I mean that's

4859
02:43:40,000 --> 02:43:42,000
you can't judge

4860
02:43:42,000 --> 02:43:44,000
a game now like Grand Theft Auto

4861
02:43:44,000 --> 02:43:46,000
5 based on Grand Theft Auto

4862
02:43:46,000 --> 02:43:48,000
1 or even like

4863
02:43:48,000 --> 02:43:50,000
some of the games that were in the early

4864
02:43:50,000 --> 02:43:52,000
3D series

4865
02:43:52,000 --> 02:43:54,000
3 through Vice City

4866
02:43:54,000 --> 02:43:56,000
and that kind of stuff. It's just it's so

4867
02:43:56,000 --> 02:43:58,000
different now that they have a lot more

4868
02:43:58,000 --> 02:44:00,000
writing involved in the

4869
02:44:00,000 --> 02:44:02,000
characters. It's not just hey

4870
02:44:02,000 --> 02:44:04,000
it's this Haitian

4871
02:44:04,000 --> 02:44:06,000
guy. He's a gang member

4872
02:44:06,000 --> 02:44:08,000
now and stuff. There's a lot more

4873
02:44:08,000 --> 02:44:10,000
to it unfortunately

4874
02:44:10,000 --> 02:44:12,000
so I'm not

4875
02:44:12,000 --> 02:44:14,000
really going to go with it. Granted

4876
02:44:14,000 --> 02:44:16,000
some of the earlier games are probably more like that

4877
02:44:16,000 --> 02:44:18,000
where it's like hey we've got the triads

4878
02:44:18,000 --> 02:44:20,000
and they're going to act Chinese and oh hey we've got

4879
02:44:20,000 --> 02:44:22,000
this gang and

4880
02:44:22,000 --> 02:44:24,000
this nationality because

4881
02:44:24,000 --> 02:44:26,000
they were limited in what they could do as far as

4882
02:44:26,000 --> 02:44:28,000
looks and stuff. They couldn't

4883
02:44:28,000 --> 02:44:30,000
get that many characters that look

4884
02:44:30,000 --> 02:44:32,000
different. Memory. Also if I

4885
02:44:32,000 --> 02:44:34,000
may say something he made a point

4886
02:44:34,000 --> 02:44:36,000
though that is something that I have very

4887
02:44:36,000 --> 02:44:38,000
recently said to my mother

4888
02:44:38,000 --> 02:44:40,000
freedom of speech does not mean freedom from consequence

4889
02:44:40,000 --> 02:44:42,000
and so

4890
02:44:42,000 --> 02:44:44,000
I'm sure they had

4891
02:44:44,000 --> 02:44:46,000
to have anticipated some fallout from it.

4892
02:44:46,000 --> 02:44:48,000
Alrighty.

4893
02:44:48,000 --> 02:44:50,000
Now the big bulk of the email talks

4894
02:44:50,000 --> 02:44:52,000
about Steam Machines and

4895
02:44:52,000 --> 02:44:54,000
kind of a bit of counter points to

4896
02:44:54,000 --> 02:44:56,000
Steam Machines and he basically says

4897
02:44:56,000 --> 02:44:58,000
congratulations on being one of the

4898
02:44:58,000 --> 02:45:00,000
few podcasts that didn't declare the Steam

4899
02:45:00,000 --> 02:45:02,000
Machine the greatest thing ever and

4900
02:45:02,000 --> 02:45:04,000
I often find that Steam and Blizzard

4901
02:45:04,000 --> 02:45:06,000
and Nintendo have a tendency to get away with things

4902
02:45:06,000 --> 02:45:08,000
that other game companies would be eviscerated for

4903
02:45:08,000 --> 02:45:10,000
and there's a double

4904
02:45:10,000 --> 02:45:12,000
standard in gaming media and it sickens

4905
02:45:12,000 --> 02:45:14,000
me says the email.

4906
02:45:14,000 --> 02:45:16,000
And then he goes on a great deal to talk about Steam

4907
02:45:16,000 --> 02:45:18,000
Machine and I'm going to apologize because this is the part I've

4908
02:45:18,000 --> 02:45:20,000
really got to trim down for time.

4909
02:45:20,000 --> 02:45:22,000
But basically he says

4910
02:45:22,000 --> 02:45:24,000
A. People who don't already

4911
02:45:24,000 --> 02:45:26,000
have PCs are not going to buy a thousand

4912
02:45:26,000 --> 02:45:28,000
dollar hardware and two hundred dollar yearly upgrades

4913
02:45:28,000 --> 02:45:30,000
for the privilege of being locked to a single vendor

4914
02:45:30,000 --> 02:45:32,000
and losing all the portability and

4915
02:45:32,000 --> 02:45:34,000
control they enjoy on consoles. I think there's

4916
02:45:34,000 --> 02:45:36,000
a little bit of worry that

4917
02:45:36,000 --> 02:45:38,000
the Steam Machine is not going to give you the plug and play

4918
02:45:38,000 --> 02:45:40,000
that PCs essentially give you in the build

4919
02:45:40,000 --> 02:45:42,000
drone PC world. You don't have that

4920
02:45:42,000 --> 02:45:44,000
same freedom and I get that.

4921
02:45:44,000 --> 02:45:46,000
And he kind of draws comparisons

4922
02:45:46,000 --> 02:45:48,000
to 3DO with that as well.

4923
02:45:48,000 --> 02:45:50,000
And then he talks

4924
02:45:50,000 --> 02:45:52,000
about

4925
02:45:52,000 --> 02:45:54,000
how many games

4926
02:45:54,000 --> 02:45:56,000
sorry

4927
02:45:56,000 --> 02:45:58,000
I'm trying to paraphrase

4928
02:45:58,000 --> 02:46:00,000
this here. It's basically

4929
02:46:00,000 --> 02:46:02,000
if you're

4930
02:46:02,000 --> 02:46:04,000
invested in Steam you likely know how to

4931
02:46:04,000 --> 02:46:06,000
get your PC working on the television

4932
02:46:06,000 --> 02:46:08,000
which also has the bonus of allowing

4933
02:46:08,000 --> 02:46:10,000
you to play games from anywhere not just

4934
02:46:10,000 --> 02:46:12,000
Steam. How many games particularly

4935
02:46:12,000 --> 02:46:14,000
games that wouldn't be god awful on any

4936
02:46:14,000 --> 02:46:16,000
kind of controller don't come to consoles

4937
02:46:16,000 --> 02:46:18,000
anymore. To hear PC gamers

4938
02:46:18,000 --> 02:46:20,000
tell it much of what comes out on PC nowadays

4939
02:46:20,000 --> 02:46:22,000
is console ports outside of a few

4940
02:46:22,000 --> 02:46:24,000
indie outliers in Valve so

4941
02:46:24,000 --> 02:46:26,000
that's not going to be enough to push people who aren't already

4942
02:46:26,000 --> 02:46:28,000
in the PC space. Then he goes on

4943
02:46:28,000 --> 02:46:30,000
to talk about the controller and

4944
02:46:30,000 --> 02:46:32,000
you know is it really going to have

4945
02:46:32,000 --> 02:46:34,000
everybody on board to support it

4946
02:46:34,000 --> 02:46:36,000
and so on.

4947
02:46:36,000 --> 02:46:38,000
Ownership of the software is another huge

4948
02:46:38,000 --> 02:46:40,000
point. PC gamers

4949
02:46:40,000 --> 02:46:42,000
he says have

4950
02:46:42,000 --> 02:46:44,000
gone to Valve in force but

4951
02:46:44,000 --> 02:46:46,000
the mainstream market isn't going to spend

4952
02:46:46,000 --> 02:46:48,000
$60 on title they don't feel like

4953
02:46:48,000 --> 02:46:50,000
they own. Steam

4954
02:46:50,000 --> 02:46:52,000
has lots of sales to alleviate that but we're

4955
02:46:52,000 --> 02:46:54,000
never going to get the point where 99 cent or $5

4956
02:46:54,000 --> 02:46:56,000
or even $5 to $15 is the

4957
02:46:56,000 --> 02:46:58,000
norm for new released AAA

4958
02:46:58,000 --> 02:47:00,000
titles. Activision would laugh Valve

4959
02:47:00,000 --> 02:47:02,000
reps right out of the office in mere suggestion

4960
02:47:02,000 --> 02:47:04,000
of devaluing the massive call of duty money

4961
02:47:04,000 --> 02:47:06,000
machine to get that way. But Activision

4962
02:47:06,000 --> 02:47:08,000
I think Activision is kind of

4963
02:47:08,000 --> 02:47:10,000
in the minor well they're not in the minority

4964
02:47:10,000 --> 02:47:12,000
but they're them take

4965
02:47:12,000 --> 02:47:14,000
two and

4966
02:47:14,000 --> 02:47:16,000
EA the big three

4967
02:47:16,000 --> 02:47:18,000
guys you know they put out some massive

4968
02:47:18,000 --> 02:47:20,000
titles that are also on PC

4969
02:47:20,000 --> 02:47:22,000
yeah call of duty it's still

4970
02:47:22,000 --> 02:47:24,000
$60 on PC and

4971
02:47:24,000 --> 02:47:26,000
that didn't used to be the case it used to be

4972
02:47:26,000 --> 02:47:28,000
10 bucks cheaper but they for

4973
02:47:28,000 --> 02:47:30,000
our call of duty so we can get away with

4974
02:47:30,000 --> 02:47:32,000
that you know but that's

4975
02:47:32,000 --> 02:47:34,000
not true for everything like NBA 2K

4976
02:47:34,000 --> 02:47:36,000
14 is 30 bucks

4977
02:47:36,000 --> 02:47:38,000
on PC versus

4978
02:47:38,000 --> 02:47:40,000
60 on console and

4979
02:47:40,000 --> 02:47:42,000
so and I think

4980
02:47:42,000 --> 02:47:44,000
you know some of their bigger tiles yeah

4981
02:47:44,000 --> 02:47:46,000
the price point is the

4982
02:47:46,000 --> 02:47:48,000
same as console but

4983
02:47:48,000 --> 02:47:50,000
you know there's also modding support with

4984
02:47:50,000 --> 02:47:52,000
some of these games there's also

4985
02:47:52,000 --> 02:47:54,000
you know all the different features they can get on

4986
02:47:54,000 --> 02:47:56,000
you know PC and plus the

4987
02:47:56,000 --> 02:47:58,000
PC retail market there's not really a

4988
02:47:58,000 --> 02:48:00,000
big retail market anymore for PC good luck

4989
02:48:00,000 --> 02:48:02,000
finding you know

4990
02:48:02,000 --> 02:48:04,000
the one rack that they have a GameStop

4991
02:48:04,000 --> 02:48:06,000
or something that has your PC product that's the

4992
02:48:06,000 --> 02:48:08,000
biggest point I get from this

4993
02:48:08,000 --> 02:48:10,000
email that I really want to call out and this will be the

4994
02:48:10,000 --> 02:48:12,000
last thing I say about this email I want to read this one paragraph

4995
02:48:12,000 --> 02:48:14,000
all this of course ignores

4996
02:48:14,000 --> 02:48:16,000
the likely fact that these things will almost

4997
02:48:16,000 --> 02:48:18,000
certainly not be heavily promoted by

4998
02:48:18,000 --> 02:48:20,000
GameStop or Best Buy at least in

4999
02:48:20,000 --> 02:48:22,000
a manner other than trade in your steam machine here

5000
02:48:22,000 --> 02:48:24,000
both of who have very lucrative

5001
02:48:24,000 --> 02:48:26,000
pre-owned programs that won't that they won't

5002
02:48:26,000 --> 02:48:28,000
put in jeopardy good luck selling a box

5003
02:48:28,000 --> 02:48:30,000
with no mainstream appeal at Walmart

5004
02:48:30,000 --> 02:48:32,000
especially the most mostly disinterested

5005
02:48:32,000 --> 02:48:34,000
hardware partners who aren't going to make a massive

5006
02:48:34,000 --> 02:48:36,000
push without software compensation

5007
02:48:36,000 --> 02:48:38,000
I do get that point

5008
02:48:38,000 --> 02:48:40,000
and it is a good question to ask

5009
02:48:40,000 --> 02:48:42,000
who is this for?

5010
02:48:42,000 --> 02:48:44,000
I don't know that's the thing it's like I don't

5011
02:48:44,000 --> 02:48:46,000
understand because if they're trying to compete

5012
02:48:46,000 --> 02:48:48,000
like he does make a point sorry

5013
02:48:48,000 --> 02:48:50,000
he does make a point the hardcore

5014
02:48:50,000 --> 02:48:52,000
PC users already figured out how to

5015
02:48:52,000 --> 02:48:54,000
hook these things up to their TV the

5016
02:48:54,000 --> 02:48:56,000
casuals aren't going to buy something

5017
02:48:56,000 --> 02:48:58,000
like this when there's like the consoles

5018
02:48:58,000 --> 02:49:00,000
and other especially like at a Walmart

5019
02:49:00,000 --> 02:49:02,000
there's lots like cheaper stuff sitting on the shelves

5020
02:49:02,000 --> 02:49:04,000
who is this really for?

5021
02:49:04,000 --> 02:49:06,000
I don't know because you know

5022
02:49:06,000 --> 02:49:08,000
the thing is

5023
02:49:08,000 --> 02:49:10,000
if they're going to compete with consoles

5024
02:49:10,000 --> 02:49:12,000
if they compete with price I mean because this is

5025
02:49:12,000 --> 02:49:14,000
look at we give at least I

5026
02:49:14,000 --> 02:49:16,000
give shit to Xbox One for being $100

5027
02:49:16,000 --> 02:49:18,000
more than the Playstation 4 but

5028
02:49:18,000 --> 02:49:20,000
fuck a PC with a

5029
02:49:20,000 --> 02:49:22,000
Titan graphics card

5030
02:49:22,000 --> 02:49:24,000
it is not going to be anywhere near $500

5031
02:49:24,000 --> 02:49:26,000
that shit's going to be like $1500

5032
02:49:26,000 --> 02:49:28,000
alright so

5033
02:49:28,000 --> 02:49:30,000
to give a counterpoint to

5034
02:49:30,000 --> 02:49:32,000
Ross Deal's email let me go to our chat room at

5035
02:49:32,000 --> 02:49:34,000
live.vognetwork.com and I think this is a good way to

5036
02:49:34,000 --> 02:49:36,000
end it on Dungeon Buster says

5037
02:49:36,000 --> 02:49:38,000
who says that Valve might decide to

5038
02:49:38,000 --> 02:49:40,000
go the general retail route at all?

5039
02:49:40,000 --> 02:49:42,000
and I think that's a good point and

5040
02:49:42,000 --> 02:49:44,000
maybe something we need to consider that

5041
02:49:44,000 --> 02:49:46,000
maybe the media

5042
02:49:46,000 --> 02:49:48,000
gaming media or whatever you want to call it

5043
02:49:48,000 --> 02:49:50,000
maybe we're making a bigger deal out of this

5044
02:49:50,000 --> 02:49:52,000
than it really is

5045
02:49:52,000 --> 02:49:54,000
who knows?

5046
02:49:54,000 --> 02:49:56,000
alright let's move on

5047
02:49:56,000 --> 02:49:58,000
lots of email tonight

5048
02:49:58,000 --> 02:50:00,000
I fully look forward to the origins machine

5049
02:50:00,000 --> 02:50:02,000
no thanks

5050
02:50:02,000 --> 02:50:04,000
pass pass

5051
02:50:04,000 --> 02:50:06,000
alright let's get to the FUs of the week

5052
02:50:06,000 --> 02:50:08,000
where we get a little angsty on the show

5053
02:50:08,000 --> 02:50:10,000
because

5054
02:50:20,000 --> 02:50:22,000
um

5055
02:50:22,000 --> 02:50:24,000
my FU goes back to

5056
02:50:24,000 --> 02:50:26,000
the Wasp from last week

5057
02:50:26,000 --> 02:50:28,000
because the stinger finally came out

5058
02:50:28,000 --> 02:50:30,000
and my finger hurts a lot less now

5059
02:50:30,000 --> 02:50:32,000
thankfully

5060
02:50:32,000 --> 02:50:34,000
also FU to the blisters on the bottoms of my feet

5061
02:50:34,000 --> 02:50:36,000
that are right up at the top by the toes

5062
02:50:36,000 --> 02:50:38,000
because I was stupid

5063
02:50:38,000 --> 02:50:40,000
I take responsibility for this

5064
02:50:40,000 --> 02:50:42,000
I wore my Vibrams walking on concrete

5065
02:50:42,000 --> 02:50:44,000
and I hadn't worn them in a long time

5066
02:50:44,000 --> 02:50:46,000
so I rubbed my foot a little bit off

5067
02:50:46,000 --> 02:50:48,000
and then FU to

5068
02:50:48,000 --> 02:50:50,000
Wasabi the restaurant

5069
02:50:50,000 --> 02:50:52,000
their sushi is normally very very good

5070
02:50:52,000 --> 02:50:54,000
but they put sriracha damn near everything

5071
02:50:54,000 --> 02:50:56,000
like

5072
02:50:56,000 --> 02:50:58,000
thankfully it wasn't touching my food

5073
02:50:58,000 --> 02:51:00,000
except that I think that there was some in my food

5074
02:51:00,000 --> 02:51:02,000
I think there was some cross contamination

5075
02:51:02,000 --> 02:51:04,000
going on because I broke out in hives

5076
02:51:04,000 --> 02:51:06,000
and my throat swelled

5077
02:51:06,000 --> 02:51:08,000
and I had to take lots of Benadryl when I got home

5078
02:51:08,000 --> 02:51:10,000
so and for me

5079
02:51:10,000 --> 02:51:12,000
my food allergies yeah they're weird

5080
02:51:12,000 --> 02:51:14,000
but they're easily avoidable

5081
02:51:14,000 --> 02:51:16,000
so

5082
02:51:16,000 --> 02:51:18,000
fuck sriracha

5083
02:51:18,000 --> 02:51:20,000
uh

5084
02:51:20,000 --> 02:51:22,000
I guess you didn't buy into those sriracha

5085
02:51:22,000 --> 02:51:24,000
lace chips when they were out either

5086
02:51:24,000 --> 02:51:26,000
Dan told me that those just tasted like

5087
02:51:26,000 --> 02:51:28,000
hot ketchup

5088
02:51:28,000 --> 02:51:30,000
um FU to

5089
02:51:30,000 --> 02:51:32,000
my head hurting

5090
02:51:32,000 --> 02:51:34,000
cause I have a

5091
02:51:34,000 --> 02:51:36,000
I think allergies cause my eyes are burning too

5092
02:51:36,000 --> 02:51:38,000
I'll just

5093
02:51:38,000 --> 02:51:40,000
give a quick FU to the stress of putting on

5094
02:51:40,000 --> 02:51:42,000
a show and directing it

5095
02:51:42,000 --> 02:51:44,000
as much as I am very proud of the

5096
02:51:44,000 --> 02:51:46,000
people that are working very hard to do this show

5097
02:51:46,000 --> 02:51:48,000
and I know it's gonna be great

5098
02:51:48,000 --> 02:51:50,000
I want my free days back

5099
02:51:50,000 --> 02:51:52,000
less stress but

5100
02:51:52,000 --> 02:51:54,000
I've only got six more days to go it will be a kickass show

5101
02:51:54,000 --> 02:51:56,000
it really will alright um

5102
02:51:56,000 --> 02:51:58,000
last up Michelle

5103
02:51:58,000 --> 02:52:00,000
uh I'd like to give an FU to Gina Gershon

5104
02:52:00,000 --> 02:52:02,000
cause she don't know shit

5105
02:52:02,000 --> 02:52:04,000
but she does a great

5106
02:52:04,000 --> 02:52:06,000
Versace keep in mind

5107
02:52:06,000 --> 02:52:08,000
she is playing Versace in a Lifetime movie

5108
02:52:08,000 --> 02:52:10,000
just saying

5109
02:52:10,000 --> 02:52:12,000
alright

5110
02:52:13,000 --> 02:52:15,000
I can't believe you gave an FU to Gina Gershon

5111
02:52:15,000 --> 02:52:17,000
I love that woman alright

5112
02:52:17,000 --> 02:52:19,000
just a couple more stories and then we'll do some quick

5113
02:52:19,000 --> 02:52:21,000
calls we're running a little long tonight

5114
02:52:21,000 --> 02:52:23,000
the tech issues earlier put us back

5115
02:52:23,000 --> 02:52:25,000
so you're not gonna have a lot of

5116
02:52:25,000 --> 02:52:27,000
time to get through so I will

5117
02:52:27,000 --> 02:52:29,000
put the call out in just a couple minutes here for calls

5118
02:52:29,000 --> 02:52:31,000
but first Loki

5119
02:52:31,000 --> 02:52:33,000
so the OUYA

5120
02:52:33,000 --> 02:52:35,000
is coming out in European markets

5121
02:52:35,000 --> 02:52:37,000
is anyone excited

5122
02:52:37,000 --> 02:52:39,000
I know I'm excited

5123
02:52:39,000 --> 02:52:41,000
Europe's excited

5124
02:52:42,000 --> 02:52:44,000
are they who bought your OUYA

5125
02:52:44,000 --> 02:52:46,000
was it a listener or just some random

5126
02:52:46,000 --> 02:52:48,000
I think it's a random guy ok that's cool

5127
02:52:48,000 --> 02:52:50,000
I'm done with it so

5128
02:52:50,000 --> 02:52:52,000
wash my hands of that

5129
02:52:52,000 --> 02:52:54,000
so yeah it will be coming out

5130
02:52:54,000 --> 02:52:56,000
99 euro

5131
02:52:56,000 --> 02:52:58,000
Germany France Italy

5132
02:52:58,000 --> 02:53:00,000
Austria Switzerland

5133
02:53:00,000 --> 02:53:02,000
Spain

5134
02:53:02,000 --> 02:53:04,000
and it looks like Scandinavia

5135
02:53:04,000 --> 02:53:06,000
Norway Denmark and

5136
02:53:06,000 --> 02:53:08,000
oh I guess that's it

5137
02:53:08,000 --> 02:53:10,000
late October and the

5138
02:53:10,000 --> 02:53:12,000
distributors I guess Flashpoint and Digital Brothers

5139
02:53:12,000 --> 02:53:14,000
will be handling the distribution duties

5140
02:53:14,000 --> 02:53:16,000
in Western Europe while Action and PA

5141
02:53:16,000 --> 02:53:18,000
will

5142
02:53:18,000 --> 02:53:20,000
take Eastern Europe

5143
02:53:20,000 --> 02:53:22,000
so

5144
02:53:22,000 --> 02:53:24,000
hopefully

5145
02:53:24,000 --> 02:53:26,000
hopefully

5146
02:53:26,000 --> 02:53:28,000
the people in Europe will be luckier

5147
02:53:28,000 --> 02:53:30,000
than the people in the US because

5148
02:53:30,000 --> 02:53:32,000
OUYA themselves can't handle distribution for shit

5149
02:53:32,000 --> 02:53:34,000
so handing

5150
02:53:34,000 --> 02:53:36,000
off to somebody else might be a little bit better

5151
02:53:36,000 --> 02:53:38,000
and I still wanna know and

5152
02:53:38,000 --> 02:53:40,000
I'm probably gonna check this right now

5153
02:53:40,000 --> 02:53:42,000
I wanna know if people still actually

5154
02:53:42,000 --> 02:53:44,000
haven't gotten their Kickstarter OUYA

5155
02:53:44,000 --> 02:53:46,000
because I think there were still some people

5156
02:53:46,000 --> 02:53:48,000
out there that did not have their

5157
02:53:48,000 --> 02:53:50,000
Kickstarter OUYA

5158
02:53:50,000 --> 02:53:52,000
that's sad and such

5159
02:53:52,000 --> 02:53:54,000
alright speaking of sad

5160
02:53:54,000 --> 02:53:56,000
this guy has

5161
02:53:56,000 --> 02:53:58,000
definitely left his mark on the video game universe

5162
02:53:58,000 --> 02:54:00,000
which is funny because he wasn't necessarily

5163
02:54:00,000 --> 02:54:02,000
a game designer but Tom

5164
02:54:02,000 --> 02:54:04,000
Clancy passed away this week

5165
02:54:04,000 --> 02:54:06,000
in Baltimore at age 66

5166
02:54:06,000 --> 02:54:08,000
and if you didn't know Tom Clancy wrote

5167
02:54:08,000 --> 02:54:10,000
books he didn't just have his name

5168
02:54:10,000 --> 02:54:12,000
in video games

5169
02:54:12,000 --> 02:54:14,000
he was a hell of a writer

5170
02:54:14,000 --> 02:54:16,000
like Ghost Recon and Splinter Cell and all that

5171
02:54:16,000 --> 02:54:18,000
but he actually wrote books and obviously

5172
02:54:18,000 --> 02:54:20,000
these military themed novels

5173
02:54:20,000 --> 02:54:22,000
went on to be adapted into video games

5174
02:54:22,000 --> 02:54:24,000
and these games do very well

5175
02:54:24,000 --> 02:54:26,000
Ghost Recon, Splinter Cell and so forth

5176
02:54:26,000 --> 02:54:28,000
he ended up co-founding Red Storm

5177
02:54:28,000 --> 02:54:30,000
Entertainment as a part of this and then

5178
02:54:30,000 --> 02:54:32,000
Ubisoft bought that in August 2000

5179
02:54:32,000 --> 02:54:34,000
and that's just been doing the games ever since

5180
02:54:34,000 --> 02:54:36,000
the latest game Tom Clancy

5181
02:54:36,000 --> 02:54:38,000
The Division coming out

5182
02:54:38,000 --> 02:54:40,000
late 2014

5183
02:54:40,000 --> 02:54:42,000
I imagine these games will still

5184
02:54:42,000 --> 02:54:44,000
carry his name for a long time to come

5185
02:54:44,000 --> 02:54:46,000
so rest in peace

5186
02:54:46,000 --> 02:54:48,000
Tom Clancy that is

5187
02:54:48,000 --> 02:54:50,000
you know that's too bad but

5188
02:54:50,000 --> 02:54:52,000
unfortunately

5189
02:54:52,000 --> 02:54:54,000
as time goes on

5190
02:54:54,000 --> 02:54:56,000
people that provide

5191
02:54:56,000 --> 02:54:58,000
our beloved entertainment pass away

5192
02:54:58,000 --> 02:55:00,000
so take a moment to

5193
02:55:00,000 --> 02:55:02,000
66 is pretty young

5194
02:55:02,000 --> 02:55:04,000
that does make it

5195
02:55:04,000 --> 02:55:06,000
all the more tragic

5196
02:55:10,000 --> 02:55:12,000
yeah those games are very popular

5197
02:55:12,000 --> 02:55:14,000
I'm going to be completely honest

5198
02:55:14,000 --> 02:55:16,000
I'm not going to fake it

5199
02:55:16,000 --> 02:55:18,000
I don't really play these games myself

5200
02:55:18,000 --> 02:55:20,000
but I listen to other podcasters that really do

5201
02:55:20,000 --> 02:55:22,000
enjoy these games and I get why people

5202
02:55:22,000 --> 02:55:24,000
are really into them

5203
02:55:24,000 --> 02:55:26,000
I think if you're into that military stuff

5204
02:55:26,000 --> 02:55:28,000
they are a heck of a lot of fun

5205
02:55:28,000 --> 02:55:30,000
or at least they sure sound fun

5206
02:55:30,000 --> 02:55:32,000
that's the thing and hey

5207
02:55:32,000 --> 02:55:34,000
actually we may be past the opportunity for that

5208
02:55:34,000 --> 02:55:36,000
never mind that was

5209
02:55:36,000 --> 02:55:38,000
last month I think Rainbow Six Vegas

5210
02:55:38,000 --> 02:55:40,000
I remember was part of the free games

5211
02:55:40,000 --> 02:55:42,000
with live so

5212
02:55:42,000 --> 02:55:44,000
yeah

5213
02:55:44,000 --> 02:55:46,000
Halo 3 now

5214
02:55:46,000 --> 02:55:48,000
because you know I didn't buy

5215
02:55:48,000 --> 02:55:50,000
that game at launch or anything

5216
02:55:50,000 --> 02:55:52,000
I know right

5217
02:55:52,000 --> 02:55:54,000
oh I want to say real quick

5218
02:55:54,000 --> 02:55:56,000
as I mentioned that I think

5219
02:55:56,000 --> 02:55:58,000
there might have been some people

5220
02:55:58,000 --> 02:56:00,000
from the kickstart that still haven't fucking gotten

5221
02:56:00,000 --> 02:56:02,000
their system yet and they

5222
02:56:02,000 --> 02:56:04,000
are not too pleased by that

5223
02:56:04,000 --> 02:56:06,000
gee I wonder why

5224
02:56:06,000 --> 02:56:08,000
using such colorful language

5225
02:56:08,000 --> 02:56:10,000
yeah

5226
02:56:10,000 --> 02:56:12,000
alright

5227
02:56:12,000 --> 02:56:14,000
we are going to go ahead and open up the skype line

5228
02:56:14,000 --> 02:56:16,000

grand theft auto is the most played online game right now

5258
02:57:14,000 --> 02:57:16,000
I don't know if you saw me screaming

5259
02:57:16,000 --> 02:57:18,000
this out on my facebook and my twitter

5260
02:57:18,000 --> 02:57:20,000
but we had a friend of the show

5261
02:57:20,000 --> 02:57:22,000
I did see this and my stupid ass

5262
02:57:22,000 --> 02:57:24,000
forgot to retweet it because I got it while I was working

5263
02:57:24,000 --> 02:57:26,000
but please I think this is great so please

5264
02:57:26,000 --> 02:57:28,000
by all means pimp away

5265
02:57:28,000 --> 02:57:30,000
alright we have an Indiegogo going called

5266
02:57:30,000 --> 02:57:32,000
Love for Venus a charity for Kathleen

5267
02:57:32,000 --> 02:57:34,000
long story short her and her mom

5268
02:57:34,000 --> 02:57:36,000
and her friend were driving to

5269
02:57:36,000 --> 02:57:38,000
AWA and there was a car

5270
02:57:38,000 --> 02:57:40,000
accident she made it through but

5271
02:57:40,000 --> 02:57:42,000
unfortunately her mother didn't survive

5272
02:57:42,000 --> 02:57:44,000
the car accident so we

5273
02:57:44,000 --> 02:57:46,000
opened up this Indiegogo fundraiser for her to help

5274
02:57:46,000 --> 02:57:48,000
cover for medical and

5275
02:57:48,000 --> 02:57:50,000
bereavement cause because

5276
02:57:50,000 --> 02:57:52,000
there's various issues

5277
02:57:52,000 --> 02:57:54,000
within the first day alone of the

5278
02:57:54,000 --> 02:57:56,000
soft goal we hit our

5279
02:57:56,000 --> 02:57:58,000
goal which was $500

5280
02:57:58,000 --> 02:58:00,000
we're still going strong

5281
02:58:00,000 --> 02:58:02,000
it's still going for the next 39

5282
02:58:02,000 --> 02:58:04,000
days and we've raised

5283
02:58:04,000 --> 02:58:06,000
$4850

5284
02:58:06,000 --> 02:58:08,000
oh that is so good that is great

5285
02:58:08,000 --> 02:58:10,000
because you know what funerals ain't free

5286
02:58:10,000 --> 02:58:12,000
y'all and that's

5287
02:58:12,000 --> 02:58:14,000
I mean I can't imagine what this

5288
02:58:14,000 --> 02:58:16,000
poor girl who

5289
02:58:16,000 --> 02:58:18,000
just lost her mother in a horrific

5290
02:58:18,000 --> 02:58:20,000
you know accident has to be

5291
02:58:20,000 --> 02:58:22,000
going through you know and to even

5292
02:58:22,000 --> 02:58:24,000
like you know she's trying to pull through this thing herself

5293
02:58:24,000 --> 02:58:26,000
it's like this is awful

5294
02:58:26,000 --> 02:58:28,000
so I'm really glad to see the communities there and

5295
02:58:28,000 --> 02:58:30,000
supporting and putting money where their mouth is

5296
02:58:30,000 --> 02:58:32,000
so to speak

5297
02:58:32,000 --> 02:58:34,000
definitely but one good thing

5298
02:58:34,000 --> 02:58:36,000
is she is home from the hospital and

5299
02:58:36,000 --> 02:58:38,000
we do have a Facebook page for her

5300
02:58:38,000 --> 02:58:40,000

02:58:40,000 --> 02:58:42,000

5303
02:58:44,000 --> 02:58:46,000
for what we've done and she's truly

5304
02:58:46,000 --> 02:58:48,000
appreciative for it

5305
02:58:48,000 --> 02:58:50,000
that's really great

5306
02:58:50,000 --> 02:58:52,000
yeah you said there was one other

5307
02:58:52,000 --> 02:58:54,000
involved in the accident her brother

5308
02:58:54,000 --> 02:58:56,000
another friend of hers we don't

5309
02:58:56,000 --> 02:58:58,000
know the status about her though

5310
02:58:58,000 --> 02:59:00,000
that we don't know oh gosh okay

5311
02:59:00,000 --> 02:59:02,000
yeah wow

5312
02:59:02,000 --> 02:59:04,000
it's just I'm just happy

5313
02:59:04,000 --> 02:59:06,000
that even though

5314
02:59:06,000 --> 02:59:08,000
it just happened within the cosplay community

5315
02:59:08,000 --> 02:59:10,000
we have people who are connected to

5316
02:59:10,000 --> 02:59:12,000
the cosplay community anime furry

5317
02:59:12,000 --> 02:59:14,000
gaming tabletop

5318
02:59:14,000 --> 02:59:16,000
just running it around

5319
02:59:16,000 --> 02:59:18,000
like a telephone just spreading the word

5320
02:59:18,000 --> 02:59:20,000
coming together

5321
02:59:20,000 --> 02:59:22,000
as one giant family

5322
02:59:22,000 --> 02:59:24,000
to help one of our own

5323
02:59:24,000 --> 02:59:26,000
and Atlanta is the place for that to happen

5324
02:59:26,000 --> 02:59:28,000
too I saw that at Dragon Con

5325
02:59:28,000 --> 02:59:30,000
with everybody coming together and so

5326
02:59:30,000 --> 02:59:32,000
I'm sure anime weekend Atlanta

5327
02:59:32,000 --> 02:59:34,000
is probably just the cool down convention

5328
02:59:34,000 --> 02:59:36,000
from Dragon Con in some way I shouldn't say

5329
02:59:36,000 --> 02:59:38,000
that that might be offensive to some but

5330
02:59:38,000 --> 02:59:40,000
I don't mean it to be whatsoever

5331
02:59:40,000 --> 02:59:42,000
because I think I had such a blast

5332
02:59:42,000 --> 02:59:44,000
at Dragon Con I'm sure

5333
02:59:44,000 --> 02:59:46,000
Atlanta puts on some great stuff

5334
02:59:46,000 --> 02:59:48,000
I'll give you a hint this is how you know

5335
02:59:48,000 --> 02:59:50,000
this is your cool down con if you're at

5336
02:59:50,000 --> 02:59:52,000
the convention you find yourself drinking

5337
02:59:52,000 --> 02:59:54,000
more than anything else

5338
02:59:54,000 --> 02:59:56,000
that's your cool down con

5339
02:59:56,000 --> 02:59:58,000
I like that

5340
02:59:58,000 --> 03:00:00,000
we did a lot of that at Fonomy though

5341
03:00:00,000 --> 03:00:02,000
yup

5342
03:00:02,000 --> 03:00:04,000
I remember trying to find the one vending

5343
03:00:04,000 --> 03:00:06,000
machine that actually had soda

5344
03:00:06,000 --> 03:00:08,000
that wasn't horribly expensive

5345
03:00:08,000 --> 03:00:10,000
and you were ready to attack you were

5346
03:00:10,000 --> 03:00:12,000
ready to jump over that counter at that

5347
03:00:12,000 --> 03:00:14,000
woman who couldn't serve us alcohol

5348
03:00:14,000 --> 03:00:16,000
because it was clothes or something like that

5349
03:00:16,000 --> 03:00:18,000
thank god for Pineapple Malibu

it got bumped with the whole hiccup

5391
03:01:40,000 --> 03:01:42,000
we had during part A where

5392
03:01:42,000 --> 03:01:44,000
our radio provider just

5393
03:01:44,000 --> 03:01:46,000
took a crap

5394
03:01:46,000 --> 03:01:48,000
or something I don't know anyway

5395
03:01:48,000 --> 03:01:50,000

Zaku? I'm doing fine

5400
03:01:58,000 --> 03:02:00,000
yeah I've been at my girl's place for

5401
03:02:00,000 --> 03:02:02,000
a few weekends now but

5402
03:02:02,000 --> 03:02:04,000
other than that it's yeah

5403
03:02:04,000 --> 03:02:06,000
I've been missing out on O.L.R. so I'm

5404
03:02:06,000 --> 03:02:08,000
playing catch up while she's in Europe for

5405
03:02:08,000 --> 03:02:10,000
a few weeks alright well I suppose

5406
03:02:10,000 --> 03:02:12,000
we can forgive

5407
03:02:12,000 --> 03:02:14,000
this one time but what's on your mind?

5408
03:02:14,000 --> 03:02:16,000
nothing much just

5409
03:02:16,000 --> 03:02:18,000
trying to order on GTA V

5410
03:02:18,000 --> 03:02:20,000
as much as I can

5411
03:02:20,000 --> 03:02:22,000
it's been pretty much the center piece of my

5412
03:02:22,000 --> 03:02:24,000
gaming life for

5413
03:02:24,000 --> 03:02:26,000
the past few weeks now

5414
03:02:26,000 --> 03:02:28,000
so what is it about this game that just makes you

5415
03:02:28,000 --> 03:02:30,000
so crazy about it?

5416
03:02:30,000 --> 03:02:32,000
Trevor I'm not going to spoil it

5417
03:02:32,000 --> 03:02:34,000
but just that character alone

5418
03:02:34,000 --> 03:02:36,000
I see Loki smiling

5419
03:02:36,000 --> 03:02:38,000
over there so you get it

5420
03:02:38,000 --> 03:02:40,000
mmhmm

5421
03:02:40,000 --> 03:02:42,000
and I probably haven't

5422
03:02:42,000 --> 03:02:44,000
even gotten through half the game

5423
03:02:44,000 --> 03:02:46,000
and already he's already

5424
03:02:46,000 --> 03:02:48,000
he's already proven to be the

5425
03:02:48,000 --> 03:02:50,000
you know the

5426
03:02:50,000 --> 03:02:52,000
batshit insane one

5427
03:02:52,000 --> 03:02:54,000
otherwise the others are just as

5428
03:02:54,000 --> 03:02:56,000
fucked up you know like Michael

5429
03:02:56,000 --> 03:02:58,000
and Franklin but yeah

5430
03:02:58,000 --> 03:03:00,000
that's what I've

5431
03:03:00,000 --> 03:03:02,000
been doing so far and

5432
03:03:02,000 --> 03:03:04,000
you know trying to get myself

5433
03:03:04,000 --> 03:03:06,000
in that steam machine beta

5434
03:03:06,000 --> 03:03:08,000
I think a lot of people are with you there

5435
03:03:08,000 --> 03:03:10,000
good luck though I hope

5436
03:03:10,000 --> 03:03:12,000
somebody in the O.L.R. gets one

5437
03:03:12,000 --> 03:03:14,000
and please give us the exclusive

5438
03:03:14,000 --> 03:03:16,000
hearts

5439
03:03:16,000 --> 03:03:18,000
yeah I know I mean it took a while

5440
03:03:18,000 --> 03:03:20,000
all I had to do was just like the last thing I had to do

5441
03:03:20,000 --> 03:03:22,000
was play something with the controller

5442
03:03:22,000 --> 03:03:24,000
which I was able to do

5443
03:03:24,000 --> 03:03:26,000
a few days ago but other than that

5444
03:03:26,000 --> 03:03:28,000
I'm already in

5445
03:03:28,000 --> 03:03:30,000
what was I going to say

5446
03:03:30,000 --> 03:03:32,000
what

5447
03:03:32,000 --> 03:03:34,000
about Grand Theft Auto 5 online

5448
03:03:34,000 --> 03:03:36,000
have you been dipping into that at all?

5449
03:03:36,000 --> 03:03:38,000
haven't done that yet

5450
03:03:38,000 --> 03:03:40,000
I guess I've made it a personal

5451
03:03:40,000 --> 03:03:42,000
mission of mine to just

5452
03:03:42,000 --> 03:03:44,000
wait it out as much as possible

5453
03:03:44,000 --> 03:03:46,000
instead of having to deal with the disappointment

5454
03:03:46,000 --> 03:03:48,000
of not getting in and speaking

5455
03:03:48,000 --> 03:03:50,000
of which have you guys

5456
03:03:50,000 --> 03:03:52,000
thought about creating a crew for

5457
03:03:52,000 --> 03:03:54,000
O.L.R. in the social club?

5458
03:03:54,000 --> 03:03:56,000
that's already happened

5459
03:03:56,000 --> 03:03:58,000
you might have missed Loki giving it a shout out in part A

5460
03:03:58,000 --> 03:04:00,000
but one more time Loki how can they find the

5461
03:04:00,000 --> 03:04:02,000
VoG community club?

5462
03:04:02,000 --> 03:04:04,000
if you go to

5463
03:04:04,000 --> 03:04:06,000
the rockstar social club

5464
03:04:06,000 --> 03:04:08,000
which I believe is socialclub.rockstar.com

5465
03:04:08,000 --> 03:04:10,000
and then you can

5466
03:04:10,000 --> 03:04:12,000
go to I think it's slash cruise

5467
03:04:12,000 --> 03:04:14,000
slash VoG network

5468
03:04:14,000 --> 03:04:16,000
would be how you would

5469
03:04:16,000 --> 03:04:18,000
get to it

5470
03:04:18,000 --> 03:04:20,000
socialclub.rockstargames.com

5471
03:04:20,000 --> 03:04:22,000
slash cruise slash VoG network

5472
03:04:22,000 --> 03:04:24,000
and the other option

5473
03:04:24,000 --> 03:04:26,000
would be to also go into our forums

5474
03:04:26,000 --> 03:04:28,000
and we have a link there too

5475
03:04:28,000 --> 03:04:30,000
I see

5476
03:04:30,000 --> 03:04:32,000
I guess I'll

5477
03:04:32,000 --> 03:04:34,000
end up trying that and hopefully

5478
03:04:34,000 --> 03:04:36,000
it won't be as

5479
03:04:36,000 --> 03:04:38,000
try to shoot Loki a bunch for me

5480
03:04:38,000 --> 03:04:40,000
since I don't know when I'll get in there

5481
03:04:40,000 --> 03:04:42,000
I mean

5482
03:04:42,000 --> 03:04:44,000
you gotta give rockstar credit

5483
03:04:44,000 --> 03:04:46,000
given the fact that they're doing their best to try to

5484
03:04:46,000 --> 03:04:48,000
you know, lurch this thing forward

5485
03:04:48,000 --> 03:04:50,000
as much as possible without any false starts

5486
03:04:50,000 --> 03:04:52,000
but then again it's like a bad

5487
03:04:52,000 --> 03:04:54,000
week to be an IT

5488
03:04:54,000 --> 03:04:56,000
grunt

5489
03:04:56,000 --> 03:04:58,000
if it's not Grand Theft Auto online

5490
03:04:58,000 --> 03:05:00,000
it's the health exchanges basically

5491
03:05:00,000 --> 03:05:02,000
not being up

5492
03:05:02,000 --> 03:05:04,000
so it's basically

5493
03:05:04,000 --> 03:05:06,000
all around, there's demand for just about

5494
03:05:06,000 --> 03:05:08,000
everything. The woes of being

5495
03:05:08,000 --> 03:05:10,000
popular on the internet. That is

5496
03:05:10,000 --> 03:05:12,000
true. Alright Zaku

5497
03:05:12,000 --> 03:05:14,000
I gotta let you go, we gotta go wrap up

5498
03:05:14,000 --> 03:05:16,000
but thank you so much for the call buddy

5499
03:05:16,000 --> 03:05:18,000
take care, have fun shooting

5500
03:05:18,000 --> 03:05:20,000
people in Grand Theft Auto

5501
03:05:20,000 --> 03:05:22,000
yeah, will do

5502
03:05:22,000 --> 03:05:24,000
stay good

5503
03:05:24,000 --> 03:05:26,000
sadly guys I am going to close up the skyline

5504
03:05:26,000 --> 03:05:28,000
I am so sorry, I know there were more trying to get through

5505
03:05:28,000 --> 03:05:30,000
but we are almost to

5506
03:05:30,000 --> 03:05:32,000
9.30 our time which for us is really late

5507
03:05:32,000 --> 03:05:34,000
I do want to just encourage you

5508
03:05:34,000 --> 03:05:36,000
if you do have something to say

5509
03:05:36,000 --> 03:05:38,000
Twitter is a great place to do that

5510
03:05:38,000 --> 03:05:40,000
twitter.com slash o-l-r or you can also email us

5511
03:05:40,000 --> 03:05:42,000
mailbag at orange lounge radio

5512
03:05:42,000 --> 03:05:44,000
dot com and Dark Zakra

5513
03:05:44,000 --> 03:05:46,000
loves to read your emails

5514
03:05:46,000 --> 03:05:48,000
speaking of

5515
03:05:48,000 --> 03:05:50,000
tweets, I wanted to read a couple just

5516
03:05:50,000 --> 03:05:52,000
real quick here, Tiger Claw

5517
03:05:52,000 --> 03:05:54,000
sent us a couple, we talked about the offline

5518
03:05:54,000 --> 03:05:56,000
SimCity one earlier so let me do this one

5519
03:05:56,000 --> 03:05:58,000
which is Activision Blizzard

5520
03:05:58,000 --> 03:06:00,000
turning the patent battle up

5521
03:06:00,000 --> 03:06:02,000
a notch, I didn't even know there was

5522
03:06:02,000 --> 03:06:04,000
a thing going on there with that

5523
03:06:04,000 --> 03:06:06,000
trying to bring it up here

5524
03:06:06,000 --> 03:06:08,000
let's see, this is when they got

5525
03:06:08,000 --> 03:06:10,000
sued over worlds inc on an online

5526
03:06:10,000 --> 03:06:12,000
game patent, Activision Blizzard is

5527
03:06:12,000 --> 03:06:14,000
suing back over different online

5528
03:06:14,000 --> 03:06:16,000
game patents

5529
03:06:16,000 --> 03:06:18,000
so essentially

5530
03:06:18,000 --> 03:06:20,000
what is the worlds game that was

5531
03:06:20,000 --> 03:06:22,000
worlds player software was

5532
03:06:22,000 --> 03:06:24,000
a toolkit for creating 3D

5533
03:06:24,000 --> 03:06:26,000
multiplayer online worlds

5534
03:06:26,000 --> 03:06:28,000
this goes all the way back to

5535
03:06:28,000 --> 03:06:30,000
2008 when worlds did a lawsuit

5536
03:06:30,000 --> 03:06:32,000
against NCSoft claiming

5537
03:06:32,000 --> 03:06:34,000
City of Heroes violated its

5538
03:06:34,000 --> 03:06:36,000
virtual space patent, it was

5539
03:06:36,000 --> 03:06:38,000
dismissed after the two companies settled

5540
03:06:38,000 --> 03:06:40,000
but it looks like Activision Blizzard

5541
03:06:40,000 --> 03:06:42,000
not going to settle anytime

5542
03:06:42,000 --> 03:06:44,000
soon and they are taking these patent guys

5543
03:06:44,000 --> 03:06:46,000
to court

5544
03:06:46,000 --> 03:06:48,000
I hope they can get that all sorted out

5545
03:06:48,000 --> 03:06:50,000
I think patent laws need to be re-examined

5546
03:06:50,000 --> 03:06:52,000
in this country myself because we hear a lot

5547
03:06:52,000 --> 03:06:54,000
about these patent messes all the time

5548
03:06:54,000 --> 03:06:56,000
but that's just me and that's probably

5549
03:06:56,000 --> 03:06:58,000
for another week, there's a lot of shit in this country

5550
03:06:58,000 --> 03:07:00,000
that needs to be fixed

5551
03:07:00,000 --> 03:07:02,000
but unfortunately we're out of time

5552
03:07:02,000 --> 03:07:04,000
Chell, I want to thank you so much for being here

5553
03:07:04,000 --> 03:07:06,000
tonight, thank you, I know you didn't get to

5554
03:07:06,000 --> 03:07:08,000
say a lot a lot outside but the

5555
03:07:08,000 --> 03:07:10,000
stuff you did say, I had to fist bump you several

5556
03:07:10,000 --> 03:07:12,000
times tonight so thank you for

5557
03:07:12,000 --> 03:07:14,000
your viewpoint tonight and

5558
03:07:14,000 --> 03:07:16,000
please come back again sometime soon

5559
03:07:16,000 --> 03:07:18,000
Thank you so much for having me and as soon as I can

5560
03:07:18,000 --> 03:07:20,000
Alright, anything you want to plug

5561
03:07:20,000 --> 03:07:22,000
even if that's your friend's game again or

5562
03:07:22,000 --> 03:07:24,000
what have you? I kind of want to plug

5563
03:07:24,000 --> 03:07:26,000
another game too, it's

5564
03:07:26,000 --> 03:07:28,000
also an indie game, forgot to plug it earlier

5565
03:07:28,000 --> 03:07:30,000
it doesn't have a demo out

5566
03:07:30,000 --> 03:07:32,000
yet but once it does I am downloading

5567
03:07:32,000 --> 03:07:34,000
that shit, it's called Coral Cove

5568
03:07:34,000 --> 03:07:36,000
completely traditional art

5569
03:07:36,000 --> 03:07:38,000
illustrated and animated

5570
03:07:38,000 --> 03:07:40,000
so cool

5571
03:07:40,000 --> 03:07:42,000
very nice, and Gabe

5572
03:07:42,000 --> 03:07:44,000
if you're out there listening

5573
03:07:44,000 --> 03:07:46,000
prime candidate right here in studio

5574
03:07:46,000 --> 03:07:48,000
hire this woman when she finishes

5575
03:07:48,000 --> 03:07:50,000
up all her schooling, I think she'll be great

5576
03:07:50,000 --> 03:07:52,000
alright, last

5577
03:07:52,000 --> 03:07:54,000
but not least, we go around and we get the final thoughts

5578
03:07:54,000 --> 03:07:56,000
I do want to say real quick though

5579
03:07:56,000 --> 03:07:58,000
before we get the final thoughts, thank you guys

5580
03:07:58,000 --> 03:08:00,000
so much for listening to our program

5581
03:08:00,000 --> 03:08:02,000
supporting the show, supporting independent

5582
03:08:02,000 --> 03:08:04,000
broadcasting, thank you for taking the time out of your

5583
03:08:04,000 --> 03:08:06,000
day to listen to us, if you're staying up late

5584
03:08:06,000 --> 03:08:08,000
listening to us live, thank you

5585
03:08:08,000 --> 03:08:10,000
your support means the world

5586
03:08:10,000 --> 03:08:12,000
all we ask if you do enjoy what you hear here at

5587
03:08:12,000 --> 03:08:14,000
Orange Launch Radio, tell a friend or two or five

5588
03:08:14,000 --> 03:08:16,000
about the show, and yeah

5589
03:08:16,000 --> 03:08:18,000
help spread the word about Orange Launch Radio

5590
03:08:18,000 --> 03:08:20,000
and we will grow our family even more

5591
03:08:20,000 --> 03:08:22,000
don't forget about the Podcast Awards

5592
03:08:22,000 --> 03:08:24,000
thing too, just again for your consideration

5593
03:08:24,000 --> 03:08:26,000
we would love it if you'd take the

5594
03:08:26,000 --> 03:08:28,000
15 seconds to go to PodcastAwards.com

5595
03:08:28,000 --> 03:08:30,000
and nominate us for People's Choice

5596
03:08:30,000 --> 03:08:32,000
and Best Gaming, but even if you

5597
03:08:32,000 --> 03:08:34,000
don't choose to nominate us

5598
03:08:34,000 --> 03:08:36,000
be sure to keep it independent

5599
03:08:36,000 --> 03:08:38,000
because the commercial guys

5600
03:08:38,000 --> 03:08:40,000
don't need the additional exposure

5601
03:08:40,000 --> 03:08:42,000
they already have plenty of money

5602
03:08:42,000 --> 03:08:44,000
let's go around and get everybody's

5603
03:08:44,000 --> 03:08:46,000
final thought, I guess I should start with our guest

5604
03:08:46,000 --> 03:08:48,000
Chell, do you have any final thoughts tonight?

5605
03:08:48,000 --> 03:08:50,000
It is weird

5606
03:08:50,000 --> 03:08:52,000
not having anybody come on me

5607
03:08:52,000 --> 03:08:54,000
I had

5608
03:08:54,000 --> 03:08:56,000
to do the last Showgirls reference

5609
03:08:56,000 --> 03:08:58,000
you know I had to

5610
03:08:58,000 --> 03:09:00,000
I like you a lot

5611
03:09:00,000 --> 03:09:02,000
even if that quote's gonna get you into trouble

5612
03:09:02,000 --> 03:09:04,000
Alright, Dark Sakura

5613
03:09:04,000 --> 03:09:06,000
I don't know how you're gonna follow that, but good luck

5614
03:09:06,000 --> 03:09:08,000
what's your final thought?

5615
03:09:08,000 --> 03:09:10,000
I'm very irritated that

5616
03:09:10,000 --> 03:09:12,000
Homestuck just updated and everybody

5617
03:09:12,000 --> 03:09:14,000
is on the page and now it's 503-ing

5618
03:09:14,000 --> 03:09:16,000
because I wanna know what the fuck

5619
03:09:16,000 --> 03:09:18,000
happens because it was like a

5620
03:09:18,000 --> 03:09:20,000
20 page update. God dammit

5621
03:09:20,000 --> 03:09:22,000
hussy. Alright

5622
03:09:22,000 --> 03:09:24,000
and my final thought is

5623
03:09:24,000 --> 03:09:26,000
Chell, maybe you could do my

5624
03:09:26,000 --> 03:09:28,000
nails sometime

5625
03:09:28,000 --> 03:09:30,000
then again I'm getting a little too old

5626
03:09:30,000 --> 03:09:32,000
for that hoary look

5627
03:09:32,000 --> 03:09:34,000
Loki

5628
03:09:34,000 --> 03:09:36,000
your final thought

5629
03:09:36,000 --> 03:09:38,000
I'm disappointed that I missed the leaked

5630
03:09:38,000 --> 03:09:40,000
Godzilla trailer. What?

5631
03:09:40,000 --> 03:09:42,000
They're making a new Godzilla?

5632
03:09:42,000 --> 03:09:44,000
Didn't you know? It's been all over Tumblr

5633
03:09:44,000 --> 03:09:46,000
It's like a Matthew Broderick one, I remember that

5634
03:09:46,000 --> 03:09:48,000
No, this one's the French President

5635
03:09:48,000 --> 03:09:50,000
Oh, really?

5636
03:09:50,000 --> 03:09:52,000
Interesting, alright, well, have to check that out

5637
03:09:52,000 --> 03:09:54,000
Who thinks Matthew Broderick?

5638
03:09:56,000 --> 03:09:58,000
He's Godzilla

5639
03:09:58,000 --> 03:10:00,000
What happened to my career?

5640
03:10:02,000 --> 03:10:04,000
Good things apparently

5641
03:10:04,000 --> 03:10:06,000
Oh, Matthew Broderick, yeah

5642
03:10:06,000 --> 03:10:08,000
Oh, yeah, no, the other guy did Breaking Bad

5643
03:10:08,000 --> 03:10:10,000
and all that, yeah, but

5644
03:10:10,000 --> 03:10:12,000
What happened to my career? I'm making tons of money

5645
03:10:12,000 --> 03:10:14,000
Matthew Broderick, well, I think he went to stage

5646
03:10:14,000 --> 03:10:16,000
I think he's done a lot with stage

5647
03:10:16,000 --> 03:10:18,000
Election was one of my favorite movies ever

5648
03:10:18,000 --> 03:10:20,000
That was like 13 years ago

5649
03:10:20,000 --> 03:10:22,000
The Producers

5650
03:10:22,000 --> 03:10:24,000
Yeah, that's true, that's why I think he's done more like stage type of stuff

5651
03:10:24,000 --> 03:10:26,000
Alright, there we go

5652
03:10:26,000 --> 03:10:28,000
There we go, that's it

5653
03:10:28,000 --> 03:10:30,000
Thank you again for tuning into the show

5654
03:10:30,000 --> 03:10:32,000
Have fun with your games, people

5655
03:10:32,000 --> 03:10:34,000
And we will see you next time

5656
03:10:34,000 --> 03:10:36,000
Next week we'll do it all over again

5657
03:10:36,000 --> 03:10:38,000
Here at Orange Lounge Radio

5658
03:10:38,000 --> 03:10:40,000
Good night

5659
03:10:56,000 --> 03:10:58,000

5660
