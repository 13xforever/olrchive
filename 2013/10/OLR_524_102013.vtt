Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:12.000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:17.000
This week, Square Enix announced one old and one new Kingdom Hearts game

00:17.000 --> 00:20.000
A former would-be dancing game slips down and seeks a modern revival

00:20.000 --> 00:23.000
And the creators of Missing Riven announce their latest adventure game

00:23.000 --> 00:27.000
Everything old is new again on tonight's episode which begins right now

00:27.000 --> 00:30.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:35.000
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

00:35.000 --> 00:39.000
Where every gamer has a voice, it is Orange Lounge Radio

00:39.000 --> 00:45.000
For this, episode number 524, October the 20th of 2013

00:45.000 --> 00:50.000
My name is Rob Roberts, here to talk with you about the latest and greatest in the video gaming world

00:50.000 --> 00:54.000
With my co-hosts, first off, say hello to DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
I have the coffee jitters

00:56.000 --> 00:59.000
A coffee jitter? What is the coffee jitters?

00:59.000 --> 01:04.000
I had, granted it was decaf, but I still had a venti americano before I came over

01:04.000 --> 01:07.000
And then I had coffee just now, and I've had lamb

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
Now you want another?

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
No, I'm good

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
You don't want any more coffee?

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
I thought that's how you fix the coffee jitters, more coffee?

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
No, I'm actually quite good

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
Alright, are you sure you're not going to be driving home?

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
And then, Dan, coffee!

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
I've got coffee at home if it comes to that

01:22.000 --> 01:25.000
An old OLR in-joke for those that don't know

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
Rob!

01:27.000 --> 01:31.000
We have a few of those here, we have been doing this show for quite a long time

01:31.000 --> 01:35.000
Our longest running inside joke, say hello everybody to tech master Loki

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
Hi

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
How you doing, Loki?

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
I'm doing fine

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
I'm just kidding, I just didn't have any other good transition

01:40.000 --> 01:41.000
How have you been?

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
Um, okay

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
Yeah? Anything new and exciting going on?

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
What's your latest project you've been working on?

01:48.000 --> 01:51.000
You are, after all, the man of many projects

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
Um, well, let's see

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
I'm still trying to work on finishing up

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
Actually, that's what I'm doing right now

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
I'm looking for a 12 volt battery

01:59.000 --> 02:02.000
Um, just that separate screen thing

02:02.000 --> 02:06.000
The, uh, wireless second screen for, like, the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
Oh, right, you talked about that a couple weeks back

02:08.000 --> 02:09.000
How's that going?

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
Oh, it's going alright

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
I've just been running a little low on money

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
So I've been kind of holding off

02:14.000 --> 02:18.000
Just because, um, also I'm trying to find the right battery for it

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
Because I want to find something that's not too expensive

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
And I don't really want to ship anything from China

02:22.000 --> 02:25.000
Because it's going to take a long time to get here

02:25.000 --> 02:29.000
So I'm just trying to find something that's got somewhat decent battery life

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
And, I don't know

02:31.000 --> 02:36.000
I took apart my wireless HDMI receiver the other day

02:36.000 --> 02:41.000
And thankfully, it's actually, the board inside it's a lot smaller than I thought it would be

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
And they have, like, a daughter board on there as well

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
So it's going to be easy to take apart

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
And then, uh, I don't know

02:48.000 --> 02:51.000
Once you get this second screen project of yours finished

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
What's the first thing you're going to do with it?

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
Like, what's the first game you're going to play with it?

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
Grand Theft Auto 5, of course

02:57.000 --> 03:00.000
Because, you know, that tells me what's the whole point of this project

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
Grand Theft Auto 5

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
But here's the thing, though, is I don't really need it anymore

03:04.000 --> 03:08.000
Because I have a setup in my living room where I have my office chair there

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
And my computer monitor, since I don't really have a computer on

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
So I actually play Grand Theft Auto on that

03:13.000 --> 03:16.000
Um, so, technically I don't really need it anymore

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
Because I still have a screen to play it on

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
While my wife watches TV

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
But I'm still going to build it

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
That's fair, because it's a thing

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
It's become a thing

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
And now you have to see it through to completion

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
I had to prototype something this week

03:30.000 --> 03:35.000
Uh, that it's some thing that they're planning on trying to sell or something

03:35.000 --> 03:43.000
It's like, uh, some little figure with, like, a USB, like, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth adapters built into it

03:43.000 --> 03:47.000
And a thumb drive or something

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
So I got to play with that this week

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
But, yeah, I do want to make this the thing

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
Um, I got to do

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
After I figure, well, after I get all the parts

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
So really only parts I have left are the battery

03:58.000 --> 04:03.000
And probably a 12 volt step down to 5 volt

04:03.000 --> 04:08.000
Um, and then some miscellaneous ports and wires

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
And then once that's all done

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
And I figure out how I want to, uh, be laid out

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
I have to get the wood to build a mold

04:14.000 --> 04:19.000
Or, yeah, sort of, I guess, a mold for, um, vacuum for me

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
And then I have to build the vacuum for me rig

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
Which, that's easy, because that's just a box, so

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
Oh my gosh, alright

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
Uh, let's go to our chat room

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
We do tape live every Sunday night

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
At 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
Right after the Bobby Black Wolf show

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
At the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
And if you are listening live on this Sunday

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
You can join us in our live chat room

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
Live.vognetwork.com

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
And, uh, Ragenator

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
Wanting to know in chat

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
What baconified food product

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
Did Loki bring to the OLR studio tonight

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
If it's your first time ever listening to OLR

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
Uh, hi and welcome

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
And thanks for checking us out, first off

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
Second off, Loki's pretty notorious

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
For bringing a variety of different

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
Fast food, slow food, whatever food

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
I mean, Dark Soccer

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
Pretty reliably brings a salad

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
But Loki can bring a lot of different things

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
I don't bring a salad reliably

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
I used to when

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
I bring a lot more meat these days

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
Alright, meat salad

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
I didn't bring anything with bacon on it

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
Just because I wasn't that hungry

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
And so I just kinda got

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
It's a two cheeseburger meal from McDonald's

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
Cause it's cheap, I didn't really need to eat anything

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
But I know, cause last time

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
I skipped dinner, I was just like

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
Oh, I'm not hungry, I'm gonna skip dinner

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
And then like when I got home at like 10 o'clock I was hungry

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
So I just, I got something

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
Something kinda small

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
Cause I don't really like going to McDonald's

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
In the evening cause their fries are stale

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
And yeah, their fries were stale again

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
I ate them anyways, but they were stale

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
And I'm not, not enjoying that

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
And their burgers weren't even that good either

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
So it was just kinda eating just to be full

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
That's pretty much it

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
I'd love to see you bring some In-N-Out

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
But, I, okay, I would

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
But to reliably get here on time with

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
In-N-Out, it's just a crap shoot cause I can't tell

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
How busy they're gonna be and

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
Sometimes it's like 30 minutes to get out of there

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
So, um

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
Yeah, I just didn't do that

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
Although I did eat just bacon the other day

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
For lunch, that's all I had was bacon

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
So, I guess that counts

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
And so I ran out of bacon

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
Cause we had to eat the whole package before it was gone

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
My wife says, well you ate all the bacon

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
I'm like, dude, I only had like three pieces

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
So, you ate all the bacon

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
That's right

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
Um, you know, your weakness

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
For bacon is like my weakness for pumpkin

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
And this is the time of year, let me tell you

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
Uh, oh, you're shaking your head

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
That's right, you don't like the pumpkin stuff, huh?

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
Went to Trader Joe's the other day, Alan and I loaded up

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
On all this pumpkin stuff, like pumpkin butter

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
Pumpkin bread mix, pumpkin

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
And, um, pumpkin macaroons

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
I saw those in the, it's

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
What? Yeah, oh yeah, you wanna try one?

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
I need to read the label

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
Oh wait, yeah, you're on a diet, nevermind

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
I should be encouraging

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
Let me read the label to see if it's good

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
Okay, go check the freezer

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
Burger King is better than McDonald's

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
Yes, I 100% agree

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
Unfortunately there is like four McDonald's on the way here

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
And one Burger King

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
And I just don't feel like stopping off the freeway

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
To stop at the Burger King

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
If the McDonald's by me was a Burger King

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
I'd be stopping at Burger King

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
Because I like Burger King way better than McDonald's

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
Just FYI, I'd be able to have one

07:20.000 --> 07:24.000
If I wasn't so close already to my limit, so

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
Aw, next week

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
If they're not gone

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
Alright, you can do it

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
Alright, uh, let's see

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
I had a kickoff topic for tonight

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
I don't know how successful this will be

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
But I was thinking, you know, we're getting into the Halloween

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
Season like full swing now

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
And, uh, I don't know about you guys

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
I'm not seeing as many like

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
Costume stores this year

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
Last year seemed like there was one on every corner

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
This year I'm not seeing as many

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
No, I'm not seeing as many

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
Maybe it's just the normal locations I see them at

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
I've seen quite a few

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
Well, I thought I would ask

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
What good video game costumes

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
You might be seeing out there

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
Are you seeing anything gaming inspired

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
And what types of great

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
Gaming costumes have you seen in the past

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
But this is a tricky subject

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
Because my mind always goes to these great

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
Gaming cosplays I've seen before

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
Which technically is a little different than Halloween

08:17.000 --> 08:21.000
Yeah, it's just Halloween is the day that cosplay is

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
Cosplay is Halloween for grown ups every day

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
Or every other weekend, really

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
See, the difference between cosplay

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
And Halloween is

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
Halloween you get candy

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
Cosplay you get sexually assaulted

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
I shouldn't laugh at that

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
But sadly it's true

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
Alright, um

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
So what kind of like good costumes

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
Have you guys been seeing

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
I find it interesting how Mario and Luigi

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
Have really kind of, you know

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
Gone into the mainstream

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
Well, I mean it really shouldn't be a surprise

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
Those games are obviously like landmark games

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
Like common that costume is now these days

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
When I remember growing up

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
Like if you were to dress up like Mario

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
Like nobody knew who you were

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
But it's kind of interesting that like now it's like so commonplace

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
A lot of like people dress their kids up as that

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
Um, act deaf in our chatroom

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
At live.vognetwork.com

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
Remembering Loki's Sackboy costume

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
I still have the head, I don't know where the bottom is

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
Though, but I still have the head

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
Yeah, you wore that to one of the anniversary shows

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
Or something right, that was good times

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
Was it 300 or 400, one of them

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
Good times

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
You know what I realized I still have

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
My organization 13 coat

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
So, I don't know

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
It was me and

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
Kristen and Megzi

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
We all went as our OC's

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
Our organization 13 OC's

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
Which was pretty fun

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
I do remember at Disneyland seeing a child

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
Dressed up as Sora and I was like

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
You have the coolest parents ever because

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
Like you don't see any Kingdom Hearts related stuff

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
At Disneyland anymore, which is really sad

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
Except for the pins

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
I guess now, I think there's one or two now

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
But yeah, probably just because

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
You're starting to see more and more Kingdom Hearts

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
With the game, you know, really releases

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
And leading up to three and so forth

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
I know that there's the

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
Organization 13 Mickey

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
And then there's one other that I haven't been able to find

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
Yeah, I've seen the Organization 13 Mickey

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
But, be interesting

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
It's never gonna happen, Regent Air

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
What's Regent Air saying? Loki's Tingle costume?

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
No, I think that's a lost cause

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
We gave up on that

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
Now don't get me wrong, I have the build for that

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
But it's just not gonna happen

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
I just don't want to buy that much spandex

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
What's your kid going as this year?

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
Are you doing anything gaming?

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
He's a firework

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
Oh wait, that's right, you mentioned that on a previous episode

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
Yeah, my sister is building the costume for that

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
Although, I'm wondering though

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
If they're not gonna know what he is

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
Because the

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
Costume kind of looks like a black t-shirt

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
With garland wrapped around it

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
And then he's gonna have a hat with

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
Kind of

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
I don't know what you'd call it

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
Not garland

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
But kind of the stars and stuff

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
Popping off of it

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
Not really streamers, but they have the stiff

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
Wire

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
Not really garland, but decoration stuff

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
Where the stars and things

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
Like those things you get at the dollar store

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
Yeah, I've seen wrapped in gifts and stuff

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
Yeah, stuff you would kind of picture

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
4th of July

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
He's gonna have that

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
You should have stars and stripes

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
Forever playing wherever he walks

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
That's what he's gonna do

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
I'm not doing a costume this year

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
Just because

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
I'm just not feeling it

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
I don't have anyone to dress up with

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
It's because they had to go and lay off all my friends

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
That's my boss

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
Cool, I get to hang out with my boss

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
No, I'm just not gonna do anything

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
I just don't care

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
This Halloween, it's weird

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
It's the first Halloween I've had in a while

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
Where I don't have something with Rocky or a picture show going on

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
Because that all finished up weeks early this year

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
So I don't really have anything this year

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
I did get invited to a party

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
That's right after Halloween

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
That's still a dress up party

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
Something that Captain Spike

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
Is doing

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
The theme is around internet memes

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
That sounds awesome

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
I know what I'm doing

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
But I'm not gonna say because I know Captain Spike

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
Does this occasionally so I don't wanna spoil it

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
Because it's gotta be a surprise

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
I'll take you guys off air because I think you guys

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
Get a kick out of it

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
Let's see, go into our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
BobbyBlackWolf says

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
A vog starter

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
Buy the spandex for Loki

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
I'm not

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
You're gonna need a lot of money

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
No, don't buy spandex

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
For Loki

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
No offense

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
I think the world would be a better place

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
But then we can get the glamour shots

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
Come on

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
Let's see, codeband

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
In our chatroom says

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
Trying to convince my wife to let me dress our daughter up

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
As a white mage

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
Oh I saw the pictures of the concept stuff

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
That would be pretty awesome

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
That's adorable

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
A little baby white mage

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
Well not baby but toddler white mage

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
It's pretty cute

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
I'm sure this is something that they have

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
A white mage hoodie

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
You have a white

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
Plain hoodie thing and then you put the

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
Fringe on it

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
I don't know how

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
Convincing it would look but something like that

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
Alright

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
It really

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
Actually wouldn't be that hard because

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
To do one of the concepts of a white mage

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
Your basic robe would be

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
A pretty big circle skirt

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
With sleeves sewn on

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
And then just a hoodie top

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
It really would be that easy

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
I didn't have a pattern for one that I was going to do

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
As a cosplay eventually

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
But never did

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
It doesn't seem like it depends what kind of white mage

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
You're going for

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
It wouldn't be too difficult

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
If you're trying to go as Yuna that might be a little trickier

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
Because you have to get the right colors and all that

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
And you also have to be

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
Anorexic

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
She's also not a white mage

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
She's a summoner

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
She's summoner slash white mage

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
If you were going to be a white mage then you would have to be

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
Oh yeah yeah

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
Alright

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
Or that bitch face Aerith

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
Let's get into

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
How was your gaming week and the types of video games

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
That you've been playing this week

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
Dark Sakura what have you been up to?

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
I played more fractal

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
It's just my chill out kind of game

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
So I love it

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
I'm playing more Bejeweled

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
I actually broke a million points twice

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
On one of the modes

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
Which is actually kind of difficult

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
I played Final Fantasy 14

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
Which I am at

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
The Bukake Manor

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
Or was it Hauke

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
Hauke Manor yeah

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
And so I need help

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
Doing that one eventually

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
And what else did I play

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
I actually played

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
Mass Effect 2

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
Because Becky

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
Has this thing for me using the high res mod

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
Well not really doing the high res mod

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
But I do the high res mod anyway

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
To take screen caps for her

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
Of her shepherd

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
So that she can have pretty pictures

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
So that's what I did

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
And then I'm actually playing through

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
I'm trying to finish my game on three

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
Just because I'm like I should finish it

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
But that and I need more screen cap fodder

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
Because I'm really

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
Really really really running out of ideas

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
For my stupid caption

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
Bullshit

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
And yes

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
Bitch face Aerith

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
That was from our chat room

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
And I do not name Aerith bitch face

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
I name her Aerith with a T H

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
But she's still bitch face in my esteem

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
I played something

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
Animal Crossing

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
And I feel bad because I was going to open my village tonight

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
And I left it at home

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
So sorry

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
I have three characters in my village now

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
I have Sakura, I have Tsubasa

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
Who I made just for the sole purpose of redecoration

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
And making Ed move

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
Because Ed's fucking creepy

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
Did it work?

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
No, he's still fucking there, the shit

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
And I made a character for Julian

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
For Becky's son

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
Oh nice

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
I may have mentioned this before

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
He sits with me when I play the game over there

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
And he practices his reading

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
With Animal Crossing

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
So I have to, you know, skip past kitty fuck

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
And, you know, poot

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
Well, poot's okay

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
But I have to skip past the one that says pussy

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
The naughty language

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
Fuck and all that

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
So, um

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
He used to laugh his head off at

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
Pork Sword and he had no idea

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
Oh wow

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
And I can't

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
Take credit for that one, that actually came from

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
One of Queen Semiya's characters that moved into my village

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
That was hilarious

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
So yeah, lots of Animal Crossing

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
And, um

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
Dan

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
Busted out the Ness

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
And played Kickle Cubicle

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
Kickle Cubicle

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
It's just the way you say kickle that makes it

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
Sort of come out the other way

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
I remember that game

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
So now that we have the Ness hooked up

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
I'm actually gonna be playing

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
I'm thinking about trying to rebuild my skills in Guardian Legend

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
Nothing wrong with that

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
I am going to be in tears for the next month

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
Until I remember how to play that damn game

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
Because that game's fucking hard

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
It is hard, but it's such a good reward

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
I've beaten that game so many times when I was like

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
13

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
There you go

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
Alright, Loki, how was your gaming week?

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
I just played Grand Theft Auto 5

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
Of course, that's all I played

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
But we had our fog game nights

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
Yeah, I was hearing some good stuff about that on Twitter, how'd that go?

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
Well, the first night

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
When I was doing PS3

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
I was trying to do video capture

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
And I have the Elgato capture thing

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
But for some damn reason it would not

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
Pick up the Playstation 3

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
Even through the component cables

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
Which is weird though, because I thought I had another set of component cables

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
Maybe I'm just doing it wrong or something

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
I thought I had one that was

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
The Playstation, actually

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
The multi-AV input

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
It was just that to

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
The Elgato

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
I can't find that, so I used

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
The component thing

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
That did not work out at all

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
It just could not detect it for some reason

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
But it was being finicky

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
Even with my Xbox 360 is doing the same

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
Kind of bullshit

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
Kind of skipped capturing that stuff

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
It's okay though, because we only had about

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
Two people I think the first night

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
Then on

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
Friday we did the second

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
Game night, which was on the

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
Xbox 360 version of Grand Theft Auto Online

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
That was a great turn out, we had about four or five people

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
Including Bobby

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
And we basically

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
Bobby didn't want to do any death matches

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
So we just did races

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
And parachute drops

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
And then

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
The one I think I had the most fun with

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
Was Top Fun

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
And Top Fun is basically

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
It's a team game

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
One team is in jets

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
And the other team is in cars

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
Cars are motorcycles usually

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
And they have to get from one point

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
To another point on the map

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
Without getting killed by the people in the jets

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
And it was a pretty

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
Intense gameplay

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
There was one where we had some other people join in with us

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
And we had all died

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
And then we were just watching this guy

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
Just haul ass through

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
The entire

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
Los Santos area

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
And there was this one where he hit a jump

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
Somehow and dodged two missiles

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
And thankfully I had the foresight

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
To capture everything

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
So I have that all recorded and I'll be cutting

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
A highlight reel

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
The only thing that kind of sucks is I didn't manage to record

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
My voice when I'm talking over voice chat

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
So you hear a lot of one sided conversations

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
But

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
Next time we'll be prepared for that

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
4 hours of stuff I have to cut through

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
So are you going to do it again next week?

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
Or is this a one to one thing or what?

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
It may not be next week but maybe in a couple weeks

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
We'll do it again

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
I don't know

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
I had a lot of fun

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
I think we leveled up about 5 levels

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
Just playing that

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
It was great

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
It's hard though because I know

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
People on the east coast and stuff

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
It's really late and Bobby goes up to 3 in the morning

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
Because we played until almost midnight

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
He's always up that late though

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
He runs on west coast time

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
Even though he's over there in Atlanta

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
So I'm going to try to do it again

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
Because I'm really limited in my window

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
Of time

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
To actually play

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
Because I have to wait for my son to go to sleep

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
But yeah I'll definitely do it again

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
But yeah it was a lot of fun

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
Aside from playing Grand Theft Auto online

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
Those couple times

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
I also did play some of the single player

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
Almost 86% done

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
With my 100%

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
Storyline stuff

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
I did the rest of the missions I had left

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
And I did all of the

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
Well some more of the

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
What was it?

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
Off road races

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
And assassination missions

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
And then some of the

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
Tonya

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
Towing missions

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
But the last one she has isn't triggered yet

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
That's the only thing I'm waiting on

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
To get all my strangers and freaks stuff done

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
But yeah it's been a lot of fun

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
And I'm trying to get the 100%

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
So I can start doing that chili ad mystery stuff

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
And

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
I'll definitely be playing more online

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
Especially more on 360

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
Because my co-workers flaked on me

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
I had one of my co-workers up here

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
On the Thursday night game

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
So we played but

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
I was the only one that had a headset that day

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
So that was kind of difficult to get people together

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
And he didn't really know how to join games

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
So it was kind of

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
Unorganized

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
But maybe the next time it'll be a little bit better

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
When we have more people playing

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
But yeah the one

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
Major gripe I have with

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
Grand Theft Auto online is just that

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
You know if you're getting dumped

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
Back into the main world again

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
Unless you're doing what we did throughout most of it

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
Where we just went from job to job to job to job

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
You get all

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
Split up

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
You get to constantly re-invite people back into your game

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
Just to keep everyone in the same world

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
But we had a lot of fun

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
So definitely looking forward to doing that again soon

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
Alright

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
Well be sure to let us all know when the next

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
Game night is for Grand Theft Auto

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
And in the meantime you can join the VOG

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
Crew right? Yeah we've got like

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
46 people in there last I checked

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
Nice, very cool

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
My gaming week

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
Didn't play as much video games as I would have liked to

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
This week but I did play a little bit

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
Playing some Final Fantasy 14

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
My White Mage is

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
An end game I don't know how many of you are playing

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
Final Fantasy 14 out there are an end game

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
But if you are an end game then you'll understand when I say

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
I got my Ifrit weapon

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
From the Primal Fight and then

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
Two days later got my Garuda one after

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
So many tries on the Ifrit one

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
Like two days later I get the better one from Garuda but whatever

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
And I finally got enough

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
Tombstones to get my Dark Light gear

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
So again if you don't play Final Fantasy 14

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
That probably means nothing to you

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
But that's what I've been kind of clunking away at there

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
Is grinding away the end game there

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
As far as other games I've played

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
Was playing some more Audiosurf 2

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
They've been adding little bits and pieces to that every day

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
Since it is one of those Steam Early Access games

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
So that's pretty cool I want to do some live streaming

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
Of that pretty soon because I really

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
Really like what they're doing with that so

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
I want to kind of play that for you guys

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
And let's see what else did I play this week

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
I went back

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
And visited Pac-Man Championship Edition

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
Because I don't know if you guys know

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
But they just came out with the Pac-Man Championship Edition Plus

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
Like the Plus add-on

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
Which is pretty much just a free patch

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
For Pac-Man Championship Edition

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
But now they have a little bit of a

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
Store kind of built in there so you can buy some additional skins

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
You can buy a couple additional

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
Mazes and a couple additional songs

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
Not a lot of stuff

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
But you know it's fun to go back

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
And kind of have a reason to play that again

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
And I like what they did with the Dig Dug skin

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
And the Rally X skin

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
It doesn't change the game

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
It just makes it look like you're playing Rally X

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
But it's like Pac-Man style so

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
I don't know I kind of like that that was something a little different there

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
And some of the new songs are cool too

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
They also have the original Championship Edition 1

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
Song in there so it's kind of

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
Neat that you can go back and play that if you want

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
The other new game that I've been playing

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
This week

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
Oh thank you Act F to correct me in our chatroom

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
Live.vognetwork.com

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
It's DX Plus not Championship Edition

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
Championship Edition was the first

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
DX Plus

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
Excuse me if I'm getting confused with all these

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
freaking Pac-Man games

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
Then we had Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
And Junior Pac-Man and Baby Pac-Man

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
Yeah Pac-Mania anyway

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
Okay so

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
New game I played this week

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
Last week I told the hilarious

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
Story about how I loaned my 3DS

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
Out to Princess Irene who then

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
Went to Japan which came back from Japan

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
So today I was finally able to play

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
Pokemon Y

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
I will play a lot of it but I will say

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
It is

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
It's about time we finally get a next gen

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
Pokemon game because

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
This is the first time I've played a Pokemon game

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
In a while where I'm like

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
Oh wow this looks really good

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
This looks like it's running on the

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
Current hardware because let's face it

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
Black 2 and White 2 and Black and White

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
Were not up to par

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
With where the DS was at at that point

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
And that's probably part of the

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
Or probably the decision to

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
Make those games DS and not

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
3DS probably plays into that

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
A little bit but since X and Y

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
Are 3DS games you finally get a little

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
More kind of power in those games

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
And it's about time like

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
Kind of playing the game really made me

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
Realize like just how kind of

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
Behind the times

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
The other last

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
Couple series were

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
So yeah and I'm

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
I'm loving that

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
Within just a few minutes

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
Of being in the game and kind of getting

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
Going and going into the first area

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
There's already a diverse

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
Amount of Pokemon in the very first area

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
Like you're not just gonna get

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
A bunch of Bidoofs and Pidgeys

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
In the first area there's actually like

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
7 different Pokemon like enough where

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
You're already sending Pokemon to the box

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
Within the first little zone

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
Is the box like putting them to sleep?

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
No it's putting them in the computer is

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
What it is and there's a

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
Pikachu in the very first zone

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
And you know that's the type of

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
Pokemon that people really want

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
People don't go into a Pokemon game going

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
I really want a Pidgey

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
Or I really want a ZigZagZoon or I don't know

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
Maybe you do but most people don't

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
Most people want Pikachu

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
They want the cute stuff

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
Oh hell no I want that dark dog

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
Looking one I think it's awesome

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
So

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
Anyhow I like that there was already

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
That diversity and so forth

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
And again the combat looks great

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
The only downer is if you're playing

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
Combat in 3D mode

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
Very noticeable dip in quality

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
And I'm sure you've heard this a lot of places

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
But I'm telling you too

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
Very noticeable dip in quality

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
It's almost as if this game was made for the 2DS

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
Honestly

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
And I kind of think it was in some regards

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
And I think most people will be playing it with the 3D off

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
Because like when you're walking around the map

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
And everything it doesn't even really

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
Doesn't really use the 3D

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
It only uses the 3D in the battles and maybe

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
Like in the opening and things like that

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
That's really it but I mean that doesn't really affect the game

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
At the end of the day but it is a very

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
Interesting sign for

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
Maybe this 3DS

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
Or 3D thing is

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
Gonna be gone a little sooner than we think

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
They tricked you into buying another Gameboy didn't they

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
No I did not buy

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
I waited for Irene to bring my other 3DS back

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
No I'm just saying that

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
You know the whole thing remember

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
The thing that Nintendo is really good about is getting

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
People to buy the Gameboy over and over and over again

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
They'll have the Gameboy, the Gameboy Color, the Gameboy Pocket

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
You know the Gameboy Advance

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
SP and so on and so forth

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
Different colors

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
The DS, the DSi, the DSi XL

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
The 3DS which is

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
Basically a DS anyways

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
And now they're like oh hey

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
We don't really need the 3D anymore

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
So it's basically a fancy DS

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
They got you to buy another DS which in turn

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
Is basically a Gameboy Advance which is

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
A Gameboy

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
I will say this it's not coming up in tonight's news

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
Other stuff to talk about but

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
There is that 3DS XL with the

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
Legend of Zelda the two Triforces

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
In the top and bottom that 3DS XL

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
Is coming out

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
It was in the leaked GameStop Black Friday

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
Ad I'm really hoping

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
It is not a GameStop exclusive

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
I don't know at this point

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
Please don't please don't be

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
An exclusive because I really want one

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
But I won't buy it if it's a GameStop

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
Exclusive I won't buy it

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
But I probably will buy that

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
Because I'm a consumer whore

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
Or more like

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
I haven't been this excited for a Zelda game

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
In a very long time like the fact that they're making

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
A sequel to Link to the Past I'm like yes please

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
Admit one please

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
So I'm definitely looking forward to that

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
However this whole fact that

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
Some of the games are really just saying

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
Ah fuck 3D that are coming from Nintendo

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
Well I guess technically Pokemon

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
Is not a first party Nintendo game but it's like a second

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
Party it's like

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
It's first party they own the company that makes it

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
But Pokemon Company is in a really weird place

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
Because don't forget Pokemon Company makes iPhone

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
Apps too which is something Nintendo refuses to do

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
Oh no I guess they're going to make Miiverse though

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
I guess maybe that is changing

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
It's first party

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
Well whatever it is

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
It's still you know

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
It's still interesting

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
Anyway I'm very

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
Curious to see what's going to happen next

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
With the DS and I'm kind of wondering if we're

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
Going to see a new DS like I don't know if we

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
Would see like a new full DS next

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
Next year but I kind of I just feel like

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
It wouldn't be Nintendo if we didn't get some

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
Sort of handheld next year you know what I mean

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
We got the 2DS this year which you know whatever

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
I'm really curious what happens next year

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
Is it going to be the 2DS and the clam shell that

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
Everybody wants or is it going to be like

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
3DS XL Uber

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
Or something you know I'm so curious

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
Tablet

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
It's already one screen you just take the little

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
Middle the middle thing out of the

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
Out of the way and then there you go

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
You have one giant screen that you

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
Can play 2DS games on or

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
3DS games whatever you want to call them

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
So a Nintendo iPad

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
And then basically the whole thing is a touch screen

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
So you can run these you know games that are that big

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
Or I don't know they'll allow

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
You to run 3DS games on your

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
Wii U

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
Because that's going to happen

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
Eventually I will say it

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
Again and again it's going to happen

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
Maybe every single week but eventually it'll happen

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
I'll be like see I told you so

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
Or it won't ever happen

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
And you'll just forget you ever said anything

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
So alright so yeah Pokemon Y

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
I'm enjoying it I'm going to play a little more

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
Way more into it than I was

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
Black or Black 2 or any of the

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
Previous Pokemon games that I have been playing

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
So I'll let you know how that goes

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
I'll let you know if I actually am able to stick with it

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
To beat a few gym leaders

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
Or if I end up giving it up and going back to MMOs full time

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
We'll see

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
Alright over at live.vognetwork.com

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
Techness in our chatroom says

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
I remember playing yellow

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
It was pretty much yay I finally have a Pikachu

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
Then it became crap he's useless

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
When you hit the first gym and end up wasting time

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
Leveling up some mediocre grass type

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
Yeah kind of

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
Is the one bummer about Pokemon games sometimes

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
Is that you don't necessarily get to really

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
Play with that starter if

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
You know the gym you want to fight is

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
Strong to that type but there's

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
Such a diversity you usually find something else

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
You like like I think it's I started with

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
Fennekin obviously but then when I got that

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
Pikachu in the first zone I was like hell yeah

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
So now I have a Pikachu

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
And then I like to have a Pidgey too

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
Because they have the air attack and all that

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
Although he'll probably get replaced later

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
But for now you know so

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
Anyway

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
Let's see going to the chatroom

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
At live.vognetwork.com

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
Codeman suggests the Nintendo 4DS

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
You move with the game

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
Now if you were going to go fourth dimension

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
It'd have to be time travel

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
Which is already available in Animal Crossing

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
And technically the

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
3DS has a gyroscope in it so

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
It kind of does detect motion it counts your steps

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
Right remember that

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
Alright so there you go

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
Alright before we get into

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
Some housekeeping and our

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
Gaming news I'll take another question

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
Here from Jimbo in our chatroom

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
At live.vognetwork.com says

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
Are Sky, Loki, and Dark Sakura all getting

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
The new systems?

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
Good question are we getting the new

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
Systems? We're likely

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
Getting a PS4

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
But I need a job

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
I still have a

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
PlayStation 4 on pre-order

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
Although we're going to get into some news here

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
Very shortly that kind of makes me

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
Make a sad face when it comes to that

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
I mean I'll still get it but yeah

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
Loki? Not at launch

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
Not at launch? I'm not getting it

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
Launch accounts on my pre-order sorry

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
Or pre-order because I didn't pre-order

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
The Xbox one please

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
Alright

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
Going to our housekeeping

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
Just want to tease that we

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
Have our Facebook

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
And our Twitter

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
So please be our friend

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
On those sites

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
Also just letting you know and this may be news

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
To my co-host too sorry about it

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
But there may not be a show November

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
10th it's looking like I'm going to be out

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
Of town thanks to Blizzcon

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
Even though I'm not going

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
I'm not going to Blizzcon

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
I'm going to Blizzcon and I'm going to the Blizzcon

33:09.000 --> 33:10.000
Parties

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
So may not be a show

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
November 10th unless I'm able to rush home and be

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
Here in time we'll see

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
Just letting you know in advance but we still

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
Have a couple weeks of show before we get there

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
Alright let's get into gaming news

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
And Loki some of the sad

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
News for Playstation 4

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
Awaitors this week right?

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
It was bound to happen but games

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
Are being delayed I'm not too

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
Surprised by this Watchdogs has been

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
Delayed to Spring 2014

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
And the reason why I'm not surprised by this is

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
Because Ubisoft has a ton of fucking titles coming

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
Out in the fourth quarter including

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
Assassin's Creed 4 and South Park

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
Among them

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
So to have Watchdogs

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
Coming out at the same time I mean Watchdogs

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
Is almost kind of competing with Assassin's Creed

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
So why would they want to compete with themselves?

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
Might as well just put out your game

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
In a slower period of the year

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
And polish it up

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
Even more even though it does kind of suck

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
For people that were hoping to

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
Buy that as a next gen game

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
When I was actually thinking about getting a Playstation 4

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
That would have been one of the titles I would have probably picked up

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
For it but

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
Yeah I guess we just got the

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
Wait right now it's expected to be

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
Hitting in the next financial year

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
Which I believe they're estimating that

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
To be second quarter

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
Of 2014

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
Also to go along with

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
That the crew has been delayed

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
To mid 2014

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
And you know

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
Around the I guess

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
Summer period so that

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
Runs July 2014 to

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
September 2014

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
And

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
I'm not surprised I mean I don't even think they really had

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
A date for that other than I think it was supposed to be

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
Early 2014 so

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
Whatever one is kind of disappointing

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
Though Sony one of their

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
First party

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
Launch titles has been delayed Drive Club

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
Which was supposed to be one of those

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
Games they actually got at least a

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
Somewhat complete

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
Version of for

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
Playstation Plus now you're just gonna have to wait

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
To play it early 2014 for that

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
That one stings a little bit

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
That was the one I think a lot of people

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
Were looking forward to you know driving games

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
Are usually a great way to show off

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
The graphical oomph of a new system

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
So that one hurts a little bit

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
I mean I guess there's still Need for Speed

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
But

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
Yeah but this is more of I think it's more of

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
Simulation racing so

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
Need for Speed is definitely arcade

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
It's not necessarily like

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
4 is a 5 or something

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
Maybe Gran Turismo 6 but that's

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
Playstation 3

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
I think with all this stuff kind of

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
Being delayed once again it makes it also

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
A hard sell for a next gen system because

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
A lot of these games that are coming out

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
There's not a whole ton of exclusives

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
For these next gen systems at

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
Launch and there's still

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
Really good games coming out on current gen

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
I mean right now

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
Gran Turismo 5 is not on

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
Next gen, Gran Turismo 6 is not

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
On next gen

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
You know there's

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
Plenty of games out there that

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
They don't have next gen versions for and

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
Call of Duty let's be honest it's probably not going to be

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
That much better on Playstation 4

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
Or Xbox One aside from

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
Graphics it'll probably look nicer

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
You know it's also interesting that

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
Big controversy

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
A couple weeks ago when Sony delayed

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
The Playstation 4 in Japan

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
To next year because they said

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
You know what we're really not going to have games out

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
Available for it this holiday

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
And now it's kind of looking like

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
Yeah maybe that is

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
The case you know

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
I was curious what games

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
Are going to be out at launch

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
What is going to be out on the Playstation 4

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
I have a partial list here on wiki

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
This is wikipedia

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
I have mine full list up in my head

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
Okay so as far as

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
I can only really speak to North America because I have no idea

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
No that's fine that's what I want to know

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
So first party titles

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
Are going to be coming out you have of course Killzone

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
Shadow Fall

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
You have Knack

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
And that's

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
Pretty much it actually

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
That is it since Drive Club

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
Fell off that's it

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
Third party you've got Call of Duty

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
Assassin's Creed 4, Battlefield 4

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
Need for Speed

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
NBA Live

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
NBA 2K14

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
There's also

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
What was the other ones here

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
There was

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
Something no one's going to really pick up

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
Skylanders, Swap Force

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
Lego Marvel Super Heroes

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
Angry Birds Star Wars

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
The only ones

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
I'm not hearing is

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
Need for Speed Rivals

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
Did you Just Dance 2014

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
Yeah Just Dance 2014 is coming out

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
You said one of the NBA games

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
But there's two on the list

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
NBA Live which is next to

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
exclusive and NBA 2K14

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
Now there are some

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
Network games too

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
Which I know you wouldn't be as up on

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
But there's things like Contrast

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
Divekick

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
Minecraft and Pinball Arcade

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
Resogun is another one

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
Those are all things that are set to be

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
Available on Playstation Network

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
Injustice also

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
Injustice Ultimate Edition

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
That's right

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
And Injustice

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
Injustice, at least the next gen version

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
Is exclusive to the Playstation 4

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
So they do have that I guess

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
I was going to say also

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
Xbox One

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
They still have a decent lineup

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
They've got all three of their games

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
I was just going to say, Xbox One

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
As much as they've been getting the short end of the stick

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
With their popularity on the internet

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
Some things they do have

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
That they're going to have on the 22nd

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
They will have Crimson Dragon

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
Dead Rising 3

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
Forza Motorsport 5

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
Killer Instinct, although I kind of

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
I've got to be honest, I don't care about Killer Instinct anymore

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
Rise

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
And let's see, Power Star Golf

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
It says it's exclusive

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
The Xbox Fitness game as well

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
There's also the Zumba Fitness game

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
And yeah

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
And then a lot of those same third party games

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
We've already mentioned before

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
I mean, Xbox, it's funny

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
It really does have more exclusives

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
That comes out, but it's going to be interesting to see

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
Are people going to pay the other $100

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
To get in on that

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
And really

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
Are the exclusives good enough

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
I'm going to be honest, when I look at this list

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
I go, Rise

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
Eh, Killer Instinct

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
Maybe, but I don't like what I'm hearing about it

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
Crimson Dragon, okay yeah

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
I'd like to check that one out

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
But would that sell you a system? Probably not

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
I don't think so, no

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
Like, had it been a new Halo game

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
That might have tipped the scales

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
Had it been that Quantum Break, that definitely would have tipped the scales

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
So

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
You know

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
Honestly, it comes down to the third party games

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
For me, I think I would like to play Need for Speed

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
For sure

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
I'd like to check out the Lego game

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
Because usually those are pretty good

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
But the Lego game to me

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
If you really want to, it's coming out on the Wii U

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
About a month before it comes out on the other system

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
So it's not really a game that needs the next gen

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
Version of

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
Skylanders, please

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
That's not a game that needs the next gen version

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
I mean, seriously, that's going to be important

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
Angry Birds Star Wars

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
Really?

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
No one cared, no one cared

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
So

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
Yeah, that's kind of where it was

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
Even when they had their full lineups

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
Well, there's not really a lot that's selling me

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
On these next gen systems

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
The only first party game that looked really good

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
To me for Playstation 4 was Infamous

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
Second Son

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
Kind of cool

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
Killzone, I'm just not a fan of Killzone

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
If it was a new Resistance game that looked that nice

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
Okay, then

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
I would probably pick that up

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
I have to be honest

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
I almost feel like in a way I kind of have to get on board

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
With the next generation

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
Just because I have this show

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
And I want to be able to talk about games on the show

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
See, I felt that way before

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
The last generation

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
I bought all three systems

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
And that was a mistake because I just don't play all three systems

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
I don't play the Wii

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
And the Playstation 3 has just gotten a little bit more activity

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
Now that I'm playing Grand Theft Auto on both systems

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
But

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
It was pretty much collecting dust

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
And the Xbox 360 was the only thing I was playing on

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
And a lot of people now are upgrading to the Xbox One

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
Because they figure

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
Well, I've invested all this time in the Xbox 360

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
I might as well go along with that

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
To carry over my gamer score

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
Which really doesn't mean anything, folks

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
Just saying

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
Wouldn't your trophy information on Playstation carry over too?

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
Yeah, that's going to carry over too

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
I'm talking about the 360

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
So, I mean, that doesn't really count for anything

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
You know

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
I just, I can't do that anymore

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
And even when I do go to buy a system

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
I'm not going to buy

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
All of the different systems out there

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
Just because I don't have time to play all of them

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
And honestly, I don't want to waste money

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
On more than one system

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
So

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
I'll just wait and see

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
I'm sure the price drops will happen

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
Or at least there'll be more games out there

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
So might as well wait

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
For something that I really want to play

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
Like a next-gen version of Grand Theft Auto 5

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
Alright, we'll see

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
Anyhow

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
Yeah, I'm curious to see

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
How that all pans out this holiday season

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
Like what games end up being the big seller

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
This holiday

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
Because I gotta say

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
It's really funny, the games

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
I'm looking forward to the most

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
Are on Wii U

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
I would say the game I'm looking forward to

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
The most this holiday is

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
Mario 3D World 2

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
Or whatever they're calling it on Wii U

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
God, I can't even tell these games apart anymore

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
All I know is it's a new Mario game on Wii U

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
And I want

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
And that would be the game I'm probably looking forward to the most

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
So

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
Anyway

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
Speaking of Xbox One

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
Xbox One, not going to be doing any type of

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
Real name integration at launch

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
You're still going to be using your gamer tags

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
At launch, now don't

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
Miss-hear me here, I'm not saying that Xbox was going to

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
Plan to switch everybody to their real names

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
Although that would be hilarious for the trolls

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
But you know I'm not here for that either

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
I threw a fit

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
When Blizzard threatened to do it with real ID

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
And I threw a fit here too

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
Well, remember, Sony's planning on doing that

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
They are, but Sony's planning on doing it through your Facebook

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
And you can use a fake name on Facebook

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
You're not supposed to, but you can

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
They didn't steal it from your credit card

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
Which still rubs me the wrong way to this day

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
Anyway

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
The game tags

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
Are all you're going to have on Xbox One

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
They did say

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
Our teams are working hard to deliver a quality experience

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
For Xbox One, this means

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
Prioritizing some features and sometimes

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
Postponing others for a later

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
Update

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
Honestly, I don't miss the fact that they're not

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
Going to use my real name

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
Who cares? Not something I really want them to use

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
Did Xbox say it's coming off of

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
Facebook? Because if they get that from my credit card

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
I will not be happy

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
I would imagine it would have to come from Facebook

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
Because not everyone's

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
Going to be, they have alternate payment

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
Forms now, it's not all just through a credit card

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
I guess that's true

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
But just so you know, the real names are how

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
People are supposed to be able to search for you

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
Like if they want to be able to find you

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
Or whatever, but then I would think like, well what kind of privacy

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
Restrictions are they going to put in place? I kind of don't

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
Want people to search for my name and find me

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
Sorry, if I want you to find me

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
I'll give you my gamertag

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
Any listener of this show that's ever asked for it

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
Honestly, there's a lot of people that share my name

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
The upside of having real names

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
However, is that it removes that aspect

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
Of anonymity for trolls

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
But I don't think they're going to

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
See, that's where your mind goes

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
But I don't think they're going to show that

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
That would be a huge privacy thing

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
Or it's even worse and they are now

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
Able to track you down based on your real

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
Name and then they control you beyond

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
Xbox on

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
Facebook or

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
Having the

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
Maybe keeping the name secret

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
But having it for issues of just searching

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
If you know who you're looking for

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
That might be something different

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
However, I don't know

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
But yeah, I got to be honest

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
If I want you to find me, I'll give you my gamertag

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
Exactly, I don't need you to be able to

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
Just search for my name

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
Or whatever, I think what they're trying to do is

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
They're trying to integrate it with Facebook even tighter

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
So that way, you know, once you

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
Once it gets you to connect it one time

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
It's going to be like, look at all these people

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
You don't have on your Xbox friends list yet

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
But you're friends with them on Facebook

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
Add, add, add, add, don't you want to add them now

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
So you can send them cookies and

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
Fight with them on

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
Killer Instinct

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
And all this stuff

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
So

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
Going to our chatroom at

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
Live.vognetwork.com

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
Ragenator says, Sky, why associate

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
A credit card number with a system

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
Where there's those PSN, Wii, Xbox Live

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
Funds, cards that are everywhere

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
Cause it's an extra step

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
No, that's a good point

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
And I try not to give them that information anymore

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
But I think they have it on file cause my

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
Xbox Gold still comes from that

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
And historically, they would have had

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
That information anyway

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
So, there you go

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
S2100matt in chat says

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
I don't really want people to know my real name here

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
Sure, I want to play with people

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
But I don't really want people to know my real name

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
Yeah, I'm kind of with you and if these systems

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
Are going to review, either one of them

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
If it's unveiled that they're

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
Going to show the real names or whatever

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
I'm out, I'm not buying the system

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
If that crap is in there

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
Yes, I do want anonymity

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
But it's not to troll people, it's because

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
I play video games to escape the real world

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
Sometimes

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
So, just saying

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
Besides, we all know that the Xbox One is going to take

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
A picture of your junk and assign it to your real

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
And then it will have your real name on it

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
Just saying

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
Maybe Xbox should think about

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
Just not implementing that feature

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
Like, is it really that big a deal?

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
And even though I do have the PlayStation 4 on pre-order

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
I'm going to be very curious to see what happens

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
With those early units and what might come out about that

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
Anyhow

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
Wine, whine, complain, complain

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
DarkSakura

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
Well, for something that is not

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
Complain worthy, something that's actually good

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
Is that Squeenix said

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
That Kingdom Hearts 2.5 Remix

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
Is a compilation

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
HD compilation that has

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
The Kingdom Hearts 2 final mix, Birth by Sleep

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
Final mix

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
And the remastered cinematics from

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
Re-coded

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
And it's going to be on

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
PS3 and is

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
Going to be out in 2014

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
But no mention of PS4

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
So this will be

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
Coming after the 1.5 remix

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
So yay

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
More HD

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
More Kingdom Hearts

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
I

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
Saw that new trailer though

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
For Kingdom Hearts 3

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
Sexy

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
Sexy

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
What did I say on my friend's Facebook? I think I said

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
This is serving up some Big Thunder Mountain Electric Parade

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
Realness

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
Now I did watch it and I was just like

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
This looks like more Kingdom Hearts

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
I think it wasn't really Big Thunder Mountain at all

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
I think that train was part of the Electric Parade

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
Yeah, and it didn't

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
His name was in the corner and it didn't say Big Thunder Mountain

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
Granted they might call it something

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
Different in Japan, I don't know

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
But it was interesting that

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
Anything they did show did not incorporate

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
Any other Disney properties

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
Besides the Goofy and Donald

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
Sidekicks that you expect to see

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
Because you saw Traverse Town

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
And then you saw a big pirate ship

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
That was like flipping around in circles

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
And then you didn't really

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
Like you didn't see

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
Mulan World

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
You didn't see Tron

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
You didn't see 100 Acre Wood

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
You didn't see any of that stuff

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
So we still don't know exactly what's going to be represented in the game

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
But I figure they want to keep most of that a secret for a good long while

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
Well and also if I'm right

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
At the two Disney parks in Japan

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
I think that there's not a Big Thunder

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
I think that they've

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
Combined that concept with the Indiana Jones

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
Ride to have an outdoor roller coaster

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
That sometimes runs backwards

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
And wouldn't that be fascinating

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
If they had an Indiana Jones level

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
Something that incorporates the Lucas Arts

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
They technically can

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
They can but

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
Marvel? I wonder if they will

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
I mean that's a little bit more separate but Marvel

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
I think they're going to keep it Disney

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
To Squeenix and leave it there

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
I think they will too

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
But I could see like a very subtle

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
Like here comes Indiana Jones

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
Like I could see that like being a thing

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
Just like a little bit of a

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
Wink and a nod to some of their recent acquisitions

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
I think putting Marvel in there

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
Would be too much

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
That's like a completely different universe

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
What about Pixar stuff?

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
I really hope they do

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
I think some of the Pixar games would make for great levels

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
Especially with how they've been pushing

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
The Cars franchise

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
Cars Land and all that

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
Has been huge

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
For a very short ride

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
Oh my god

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
I would love to do something in the WALL-E universe

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
WALL-E is kind of set on Earth

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
So I don't know exactly what they would do with that

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
But we'll see

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
Incredibles?

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
I'd be cool

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
But yeah a lot of the Pixar stories are sort of like

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
They're not really about their worlds

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
So much as they are the characters I think

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
Star Wars would be cool though

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
Star Wars would be very cool

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
Dark Soccer did you see the other news about Kingdom Hearts 3?

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
Um

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
Let me uh

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
No

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
Because my iPad's being a shit again

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
Hold on

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
I believe there is a little bit more news

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
And of course it is something that we're pretty

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
Aware

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
Was going to happen regardless

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
Is that Utada Hikaru is

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
Well may return

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
For Kingdom Hearts 3

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
Which I think is probably going to happen

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
She really should I mean

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
But she's been on a musical hiatus or something right?

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
Didn't she take a break or something?

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
She did

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
But there was actually a post

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
That came from

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
Utada Teruzane

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
Who is his

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
Her dad

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
Who said that the two of them were

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
Undecided when it came to Kingdom Hearts 3

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
So she's

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
Not contributing a new theme song

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
But there's a chance she might help

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
I sure hope she does

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
Do something with it that would be great

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
Because the songs especially Simple and Clean

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
Was so important to Kingdom Hearts you know

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
Yeah

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
Says Wreck It Ralph World

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
That would be too meta

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
Although Sugar Rush would be pretty great

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
I could still see them doing that

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
Like a Sugar Rush level would be kind of

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
Like just even like instead of the gummy ship

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
Tangled

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
I could see Tangled

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
Oh I could totally see Tangled

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
I kind of hope they do that

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
That would be great

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
Have they done this yet because I liked it

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
I thought it was a good movie

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
Emperor's New Groove

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
I don't think they did

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
Let's see

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
SSG100Matt says

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
Indiana Jones in Kingdom Hearts would be better than the Crystal Skull

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
Well ain't that the truth

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
As long as

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
I have bars low

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
Shia LaBeouf is not allowed to be in Kingdom Hearts

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
Do not let that kid anywhere near

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
Kingdom Hearts

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
You keep Shia LaBeouf away

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
From Kingdom Hearts

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
Not gonna happen

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
Ooh Act Deaf is suggesting Brave

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
Great Pixar movie

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
I could totally see that as well

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
That would be great

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
We could fan wank Kingdom Hearts

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
Worlds all day long but the reality is

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
We are just not gonna know until they make

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
Some formal announcements so we'll see what happens

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
Loki

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
Alright so some other good news for the Xbox One

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
Platform

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
They are making available to all the developers

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
The Xbox Live Compute

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
I don't know if you would call it

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
I guess

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
SDK which is basically

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
The ability to use the cloud servers

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
For off platform

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
Computations

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
Including physics and

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
More importantly dedicated

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
Servers and so because

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
Of that dedicated servers

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
For all multiplayer games

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
Is possible

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
But it has to be enabled by

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
The developers

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
Because they can also choose to

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
Have control over that

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
Versus using the Xbox Live Compute

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
Stuff and

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
I guess they are saying that they have

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
Over 300,000

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
Virtual servers

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
Powered by cloud technology

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
So it sounds like

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
That they could get some

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
I mean that's definitely a plus for a lot of people

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
That play multiplayer especially like Call of Duty

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
And stuff that year and a half

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
Dedicated servers and also kind of

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
Curbs cheating a bit because there's

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
People that hack the platforms and stuff

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
And having a dedicated

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
Server would kind of eliminate that

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
Sounds ambitious

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
And entirely

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
A good idea

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
I'm just curious to see

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
Because they keep talking about these Azure cloud

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
Servers and stuff and

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
I'm just curious to see how

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
Stable that all is

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
Because every

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
Every company comes out and says

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
Hey yeah we've seen these

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
Problems with connectivity

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
And stuff like that

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
It's not going to happen to us

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
We're prepared this time

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
And every time it's fucked up

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
So you know I'm kind of

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
Curious to see how all these servers

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
Are going to play into that

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
Or if it's just going to be a big fucking mess

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
Because I wouldn't be surprised

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
If it was a big fucking mess

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
Just because all the other

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
Online games and stuff have just been

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
Messy

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
What will be the first Xbox game to get that

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
37 equivalent or the

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
SimCity connection error and all these

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
Hilarities in the past

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
The one that I could see would be the biggest

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
Pain in the ass would maybe be fours of

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
Five because remember you have to download

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
Part of the game

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
Or most of the game

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
Because it's not done yet on the disk

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
I can see that being a problem

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
If you can't connect to their cloud servers

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
Also the other thing

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
Remember just like

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
Rockstar just had the problem where it wasn't

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
Necessarily all of the cloud servers

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
But mainly the matchmaking stuff

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
Was down and so even if you have

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
A part of your

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
Service down that it could still affect

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
Everything so

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
I don't know

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
It'd be interesting to see

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
My thought is okay

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
If it's so easy for you

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
To do this as a company

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
Microsoft then why isn't anybody

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
Else doing it that way

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
If this is so easy

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
If it's such the right way to go

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
Then why don't we have

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
Rockstar hosting their stuff

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
And azure servers and all that stuff

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
It makes me think that there's a little bit

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
More hype to it than

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
It's actually gonna

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
Be reality so

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
I guess we'll have to see when it launches

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
I'm sure we'll be talking about stories

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
Of connectivity and

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
I'm not saying it's probably limited to

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
Microsoft at all

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
If the PlayStation 4 relies heavily on

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
Yeah it's probably gonna be everybody

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
Alright

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
Shifting gears here a little bit

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
If you are a PC gamer

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
By any means or even if you've just lightly played

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
PC games in the past I'm sure you're

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
Familiar with the game Myst

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
This is one of the top selling PC games

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
They ever made it's an adventure game

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
And they've remade this game a ton of times

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
There were a lot of games in the series

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
Riven was another big game

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
These were both games by Cyan

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
Inc. was the name of the studio that made these games

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
Well they have announced that they are

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
Making a new game it's called

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
Abduction not Abduction

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
It's O-B-D-U-C-T-I-O-N

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
Abduction is the new game

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
But here's the interesting thing

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
It is a Kickstarter game this is where they're

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
Taking their case to Kickstarter and they're trying to get

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
1.1 million dollars

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
To make this game work

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
They're talking about very similar

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
Exploration driven gameplay that help make

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
Myst a reality

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
They're gonna do Unreal Engine 4

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
Is what they want to be able to license

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
To make this game work

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
And they're targeting mid to late 2015

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
So they're giving themselves

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
Plenty of time to make Abduction

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
Happen

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
So if you want to check that out you can go to their Kickstarter

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
Now the thing that really got me about this

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
Though is I'm like dude this is the studio

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
That made Myst and Riven

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
Like why do they have to

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
Turn to Kickstarter? Like surely there's

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
A publisher or somebody out there that's willing

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
To back them a little bit

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
And I'm like well what the hell else have they done

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
Outside of Riven and Myst

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
Anybody know without cheating

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
What some of the other games Cyan Inc. did

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
In the down time

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
Cause once I went to go look at the list I was like

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
Oh yeah there was that game that really

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
Didn't do well

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
It was the one that was that Myst

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
Not Myst Online or whatever the hell they ended up calling it

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
That was part of, was it GameTap actually?

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
It was Myst Online Uru Live

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
And it didn't, you're right

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
That's it, it went over to GameTap

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
In the Uru games actually

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
Uru I think was the third Myst

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
And then they did all these different Uru games

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
That Ubisoft was doing for a while

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
Including Myst 5

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
Went all the way there and then Myst Online

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
Yeah I remember that game kind of flopped

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
And GameTap picked it up and ran it for a little while

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
I actually played Myst Online

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
The funny thing is back in 2007

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
This show was around and I think there's some

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
Old episodes where I was talking about my experiences

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
In Myst Online

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
It was just such an odd game

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
It was just like, it was so like

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
Just kind of creepy

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
Odd, like the ambience in that game

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
Was really, like

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
Chills, but I mean I enjoyed what I did

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
Play of it even though it wasn't

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
As obvious of a game

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
As World of Warcraft or even EverQuest

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
Where it's like, experience leads to

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
Levels, leads to abilities, leads to gold

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
Gold, gold, you know Uru Online

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
Was a very different type of game

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
Other than that, that was 2007

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
And since then it's been a lot of

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
iPhone, iPod, iPad

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
Type of stuff

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
They adapted Myst, they adapted Riven

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
They did some games called Bugchucker

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
And Stoneship

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
Abduction is a very

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
Kind of anxious

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
Return to form, shall we say

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
For this company

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
Best of luck to them, they just might do it

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
They got a 1.1 million dollar goal

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
They have raised just shy of

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
Half a million, they're at $460,000

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
With 26 days to go

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
So they've already made

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
Between a third and a half of the money

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
With only 4 days down

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
So that's pretty cool

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
$25 or more will get you the game

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
Via Kickstarter, by the way

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
$45 is a digital collection

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
Let's see some of the crazy

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
Rewards they're giving, let's see

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
$10,000 or more will give you

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
An experience design at

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
Cyan, you can actually go

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
To an early abduction design meeting

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
You can either go there

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
Or join via Skype

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
And I guess you get to have your say in the game

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
Kind of neat

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
So there you go

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
And they're already looking at stretch goals too

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
But they won't say what they are until they reach the base funding

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
Which I imagine would just be more

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
Expansions of the game and so on and so on

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
So

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
Going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
SSJ100Matt says, Myst was odd

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
I should go back to it

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
I still have the original CD-ROM copy laying around

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
Reginator says

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
Riven original soundtrack is great to play

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
If you're having trouble sleeping

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
DungeonBuster says, Cyan went the way

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
That a lot of adventure games did in the 90s

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
Which is probably why they're kickstarting

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
This project

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
Tim Schafer had to kickstart his own adventure game

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
Just to get it going

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
Well it's so interesting because a lot of these projects

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
End up being very successful

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
So it's surprising to me

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
And especially with how well The Walking Dead did

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
Last year and was so well received

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
And everything, I'm like, I'm really surprised

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
That the mainstream is not getting

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
Like, dude, people never

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
Really got over the 90s adventure game

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
Thing, there's still very much an audience

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
For that, you know

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
Anyhow

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
Reginator says

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
SSJ100Matt is that even playable

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
On modern PC's

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
Well they had it in GameTap

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
Even though GameTap is a few years old at this point

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
You definitely could play all those games

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
I'm sure

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
It's gotta be on good old games, right?

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
It has to be there

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
Alright, there you go

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
Good luck to the studio getting that going

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
It'll be exciting if they get it done

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
I hope it's as creepy as other games

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
Dark Soccer

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
Well, Rob, this actually may affect you

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
May or may not affect you

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
And 50,000 other people that I know

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
Fucking play this game

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
Do I have to go get a shot?

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
No, no, no, but there is a bug

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
However, it's not a sickness bug

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
It's a sickness within Pokemon X and Y

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
So the entire game

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
Yeah, the whole game, no

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
Basically, if you save your game in Lumiose City

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:50.000
There is a problem where if you save in and around the streets

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
Outside the city

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
The game will lock up and make you have to reset your game

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
And when you reboot

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
The game will load the save and freeze again

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
Basically it loops and loops and loops

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
Now, Nintendo is aware of this

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:06.000
And they're working on making a patch for it

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
That will be downloaded

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
When they have it done

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
So at least they know about it

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
At least something is going to happen

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
It just hasn't happened quite yet

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
And they're saying

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
They've put out a map

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
It's only a Japanese one

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
Which I will go ahead and also

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
Link to the chat room assuming it loads

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:30.000
But for those of you who are affected by this

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:34.000
Sorry, start over and don't save in the town

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
To register participation for this week's episode

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
Of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
Use the passphrase, rainbow

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
Yeah, I'm going to make a note of that

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
So I don't do that, but I do like how in the new

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
Pokemon games you can practically save anywhere

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
So that's pretty cool

01:02:58.000 --> 01:02:59.000
Useful

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
Much useful, but it's better than trying to find a save point

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
And do it that way, that's for sure

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
Alright, let's travel around the world

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
And check out some release dates of some games coming out soon

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
That hopefully aren't broken

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
That have hopefully been quality tested

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
Which is, by the way, not to get all tangent-y

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
Or whatever, but that's the good thing

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
About those other games you were talking about earlier

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
Getting delayed, like things like

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
Drive Club and Watch Dogs

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
And everything is that, you know what

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
If they have to do that to QA the games

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
And make sure that they're going to be right

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
Then fine, delay them

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
We'll never remember that they were delayed

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
Wasn't Grand Theft Auto 5 delayed a bunch?

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
We all forgave them, we forgive them, right?

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
And it was worth it

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
That's right, it was worth it

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
So, you know what, I would rather the games get delayed

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
To test the QA

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
Now in this Pokemon, I don't know

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
Because you can save anywhere

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
I don't know if they would have found that

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
During QA testing or whatever

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
That would be a very tricky thing to find

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
It would be

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
I forgive them, but Nintendo's

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
Got to be able to patch these things faster

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
And more efficiently too, I think in some ways

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
You know what I mean?

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
Like you kind of expect on Xbox and Playstation

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
It's always going to patch right away if they have them

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
Nintendo can kind of be a pain in the butt

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
They haven't quite figured out this whole internet thing yet

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
Yeah, that's

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
And I think that's part of what's their worst nightmare

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
Right now with Wii U

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
I'm still convinced that plays into it

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
I mean, my friends have made good arguments

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
About to the contrary and about how

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
You know, there is DLC for like a

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
Now, they just started that a year ago

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
See, there's something about

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
All of that

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
And the fact that nothing ever showed up for Mass Effect 3

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
Nothing showed up for Injustice

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
And all that just kind of

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
Nothing showing up for Assassin's Creed 4

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
There's something really weird about that

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
I mean, granted Nintendo's doing it themselves now with Super Luigi

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
And all this other stuff, but

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
Are they doing it differently than it was done on 360?

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
I don't know, so

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
You know

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
I won't know, actually I don't think that has anything

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
I thought it might have been Uplay

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
Or something like that

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
They didn't support those extra

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
You know, services and stuff

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
That maybe that was the problem or something

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
Actually, that could be

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
Now that I think of it

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
If Uplay isn't supported

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
Then that's why Assassin's Creed didn't get the DLC

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
And EA

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
Uplay has a channel on Wii U though

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
Then I don't know

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
Maybe they changed something

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
I don't know, or maybe it's just

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
Nintendo or something, I don't know

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
Tangentrain, ChuChu, let's go to release dates

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
So this week we actually have quite a few things

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
Coming out, starting off with Naruto

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
Ship It In, Ultimate Ninja Storm 3

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
Full Burst, which is just a re-release of the game

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
With DLC, PS3, and 360

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
For that, Deus Ex Human Revolution

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
The Director's Cut

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
Coming out on PlayStation 3

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
Xbox 360, and debuting on

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
The Wii U

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
And of course those are re-released for

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
The other two platforms

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
Plankton's Robotic Revenge

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
PlayStation 3, Xbox 360

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
Wii, Wii U, 3DS

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
And DS

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
Hometown Story

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
If you're a fan of the Harvest Moon games

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
Sort of a spin-off of that

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
That's on 3DS this week

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
Lego Marvel Super Heroes

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
PlayStation 3, Xbox 360

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
Wii U

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
3DS

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
Vita and PC

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
The Sims 3

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
Into the Future

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
Getting, that's a new expansion

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
That's on PC of course

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
Um

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
Let's see

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
Also

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
Disney Infinity, some more of the

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
Packs are coming out, Toy Story

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
As well as the

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
Woody figure, and I believe next

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
Not next week, but the week after next

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
Is Jack Skellington

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
Where the hell is Nightmare Before Christmas? It's that time of year

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
Well, it's been a GameStop exclusive

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
For right now

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
It's exclusive on the figurine, and Woody I think

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
Is exclusive to Walmart or Target or Toys R Us

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
One of those

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
I got an exclusive finger for GameStop right here

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
Sorry to the employees

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
My anger is not with you

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
The front-end associates

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
If you want to get some

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
2K games that have been

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
Out before, there's some collections

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
Coming out, including the 2K Essentials collection

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
Which is, I believe

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
Bioshock

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
Borderlands

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
And I want to say

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
Oh, what the hell is the last game there?

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
XCOM

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
The first XCOM game

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
That was on 360, Enemy

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
Not really the first XCOM game

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
On 360

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
No, I said the first XCOM game on 360

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
Okay, okay

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
That's on PlayStation 3 and

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
Xbox 360

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
They also have another collection

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
The strategy

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
Collection, which is Civ 5

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
And XCOM, that's on PC

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
And then there's

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
Another one with

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
I don't remember, I'll get to that in just a second

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
Let's see, Rocksmith 2014 edition

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
Coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
360 and PC

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
Of course, they also have a version without the

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
Little adapter in case you bought

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
The game before

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
And a version with a guitar

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
You need a guitar for that game

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
3DS Wii and Xbox 360

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
And that's based on the new

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
Cartoon series on Nickelodeon

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
Just Dance Kids 2014

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
On Wii and Wii U

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
And Xbox 360

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
Oh God, there's a kids game this year too?

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
There's been a kids game for the last few years

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
I knew there was the one, I didn't know

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
There was four kids games last year

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
God, does it have that horrible

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
God, that joke

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
What does the fox say?

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
I don't know

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
That would be pretty funny

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
Oh my God, that song gets on my nerves so bad

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
I've finally, by the way, seen that

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
And I was sorry I saw that

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
They play it on the radio now and I'm like, okay

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
That was funny for a day, stop

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
I'm so glad I don't listen to the radio

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
It made me laugh the first time

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
And after that I was like, yay

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000
My wife has told me, and I also saw this

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
But I actually haven't listened to this song yet

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
Well apparently it's a huge kids song

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
It's a kids thing, but what does the fox say?

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
I thought it was a stoner song

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
What does the bong say?

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
What about

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
What about that Chinese food song

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
Now that, I'm here for that

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
That song

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
Cracked my ass up, and the video

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
Is fantastic

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
I hated myself for finding it funny

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
I have not seen that song yet

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
The Chinese food, that's great

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
Just seeing that guy take the panda thing off

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
I'm like, is that dude

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
It's the little things too, the little

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
subtly, horribly racist things

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
In the video, like when they're talking

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
They're playing Monopoly, like he rhymes

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
Some freaking Chinese who have Monopoly

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
And then he moves the piece to Oriental Avenue

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
In the video

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
It's like they're going for every

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
It's like they're going for every fucking

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
Stereotype in the universe

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
I love its badness

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
But then again, Showgirls is my favorite movie

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
It's sort of like, I don't know if it's trying to be

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
Lisa Lampanelli style funny

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
You know, offensive on purpose

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
To make you think about it, or if

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
It's just really being stupid

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
Other things coming out this week

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
A little game called Batman Arkham Origins

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
That's coming out on Friday

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
That's this week? Yes, on Friday

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
For some reason

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
That's on Playstation 3, Xbox 360

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
Wii U, and PC

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
And of course they have the Blackgate version

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
Which is not quite Arkham Origins

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
But it's a little different

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
That's on 3DS and Vita

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
And then Wii Party U

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
For the Wii U

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
And, you know, this game was so

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
Great looking

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
That they also have to throw a remote in there

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
In a horizontal stand for your

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
What games are in Wii Party U? I know nothing about this game

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
It's crap

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
Okay, Wii Party was terrible, it's gonna be crap

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
In Soviet Russia, Wii Party U

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
Just what the name makes me think of

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
Some other random games coming out

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
Cradle of Egypt 2

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
Which is a puzzle game

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
And Girls Fashion Shoot

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
Which is a fashion simulator game

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
That's it

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
That would be everything

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
Although, I do have to say this week though

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
I believe it's also the DLC

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
For Saints Row 4

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
So there's some DLC coming out

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
For that, the Enter the Dominatrix

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
Stuff

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
Alright, now's the part of the show where you get to

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
Hear me horribly butcher Japanese

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
Release dates, yay

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
On the Playstation 3 in Japan on October 24th

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
BlazBlue, Chrono Fantasma

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
Comes out, as well as

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
GQ Powerful Pro

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
Yaku 2013

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
Which is that soccer? It's baseball

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
Baseball

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
I knew it was a sport of some sort

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
Also on the 24th on the Playstation 3

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
Sengoku Musou 2

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
With Moshuden and Empire's HD version

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
Tears to Tiara 2

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
Hau no Matsue

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
What is Tears to Tiara?

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
That sounds like somebody who cries a lot

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
And becomes queen

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
I don't know, but it looks like some type of

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
Roleplaying-esque game

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
I don't know what this is

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
This is like half the other things

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
I see come out

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
Let's see what else, there's Root Double Before Crime

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
After Days Extend Edition

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
Kazuko Kiyakutomugu Ito

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
In regular and limited edition

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
From Cyberfront this week

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
Which looks like

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
I'm looking at a screenshot from this game

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
And I'm sorry

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
But those breasts are too much

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
For that face

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
For that cute little chibi face

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
She's got these breasts

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
She would be tipping forward

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
However

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
I can say

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
I was quite young

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
And quite stacked

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
So it is possible

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
That's a bit much

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
I'm gonna put it this way

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
I've been a D since I was 13

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
You're blessed

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
Nothing wrong with that

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
Some girls too

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
So if they don't show the boy's face

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
Then it's a date rape game

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
I don't know about this

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
This is a little bit of an awkward picture

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
That's a

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
Fucking game

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
So the quotes South Park

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
Nice

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
Not okay

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
It's essentially a moe game

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
Which Alan just said in the chat

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
Yep

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
Going to the Xbox 360

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
This week in Japan

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
Zero, zilch

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
On the PlayStation 3 though

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
That same baseball game

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
GQO Powerful Pro Yakyuu 2013

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
That's a Konami one

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
An ongoing series too

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000
On the Wii U this week in Japan

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
Sonic Lost World

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
Which I think came out here this week

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
Sonic Lost Meh

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
On the Nintendo 3DS

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
A bunch of Sonic stuff

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
Including the Sonic Lost World port over there

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
But also some little

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
Headphones and cute little stickers

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
And all that shit on the 3DS

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
And lastly the

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
PSP still getting a lot of stuff

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
Right now including that same

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
Baseball game from Konami

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
Diablok Lovers More

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
Blood

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
Yes that is the name of the game

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
Diablok Lovers More

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
Blood

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
And it does kind of look like

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
Oh god it looks like Twilight

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
As an anime video game

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
A ton of visual novel games

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
Nope

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
Nope to that one

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
Nope N-O-P-E

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
Alright Dar Sakura how about the UK

On the 25th

God tons of stuff

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
Batman Arkham Origins

There's even an iOS and Android

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
Version

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
There's Batman Arkham Origins

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000

And We Party You

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
Alright

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
Dirty We Party You

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
Or maybe

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
It's a question We Party You

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
How about this

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
Nintendo maybe you put out

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
A game on your new platform

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
It doesn't have the fucking name of the system on it

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
Oh ok

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
I would be with you there but remember

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
Wii Sports biggest game ever

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
Ever

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
No no no I have no problem with Wii Sports

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
That's fine

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
I'm talking about

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
I mean the U at the end

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
Like do we really need new Super Mario Brothers U

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
Or you know

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
Anything

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
Kind of just what they do though

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
The only system that didn't really do that was the GameCube

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
I mean even with the Super Nintendo

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
It was super everything

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
Super Adventure Island and Super Star Wars

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
And Super you know

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
But they were so much better than their previous versions

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
I mean come on

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
There wasn't really anything that was super that wasn't awesome

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
That was a pretty super system

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
The 8 bit the 16 bit everything looked pretty super

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
Thank you actdeft in the chat room says

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
Blank 64 everything was blank 64

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
On the N64

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
Superman 64 Mario Kart 64

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
Mario 64

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
This is just what Nintendo does

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
They beat that name into you

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
Or remember when they used to do it subtly

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
And this is more third parties but

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
They would use it subtly on the DS

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
Where it would be like you know

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
Something dual souls or something

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
Dragon Spirit or

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
Even the third parties got into it like there was that Castlevania game

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
Right there was DS

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
That game made me cry

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
Cry because you didn't like it or?

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
It was just not good

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
Alright

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000
Let's get to a couple more news stories

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000
For you guys and then the classic game of the week

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000
Heck yeah

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
And also I'm looking at our chat room

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000
Live.vognetwork.com if you want to join us in our chat room

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000
And lots of talk

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000
actdeft says super all the things

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000
It's like it's pumpkin

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
Or something right now

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
So there you go

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
Live.vognetwork.com

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000
Let's get into some stories

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
Alright so let's talk a little bit about

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
Games with Gold

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000
And this was something that I was

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
Kind of meh I mean it's only two games a month

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
And stuff and I know a lot of direct comparisons with

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
PlayStation Plus

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
Which by the way folks

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
If you haven't jumped on this yet

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
Shadow of the Colossus is available on PlayStation Plus

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
I need to jump on that

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
This is Ico

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
Yes Ico was last month

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000
I think it's still available

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
They cycle them through every now and then

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
But Shadow of the Colossus is on there now

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
And also

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
The what was it

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
The poker game from Valve is on there now

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
Or no not Valve

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
Telltale Games

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
The poker at the inventory 2

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000
The second one was

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
Oh yeah I played that this week too for a little bit

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
I suck at poker that's what I learned

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000
Yeah so those are available

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000
Anyways this month

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000
Of course there was Halo 3

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000
And then I forgot the other game

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000
That was coming out but they say

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
Though they are going to continue on with the

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
Program originally it was only supposed to go

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000
Through the launch of the Xbox One

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000
But they figured out that hey

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000
You know what people like values so

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000
They are going to keep on doing two games a month

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
So far

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
A lot of the games I already had but

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
You know okay

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000
Yeah I mean it's cool that they are giving these away

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
It's hard to complain about free stuff

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000
I'm going to

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
It is a little hilarious that they are giving away Halo 3

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
For free I don't expect them to give away Halo 4

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
But I mean come on meet me halfway here

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000
Like maybe ODST

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000
Or yeah I mean

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000
Halo Reach

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
Yeah or Anniversary Edition

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
Because you know the games that are coming out

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000
Like the Shadow of the Colossus

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
I think that was about a year

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
Or two old

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
And I mean Saints Row the Third

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
About two years old and it was already on

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
On there or hell Hitman Absolution

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
To be fair that is a little bit fuzzy

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000
Math for Shadow of the Colossus because it is a remake

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000
Of a much older game

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
I understand but the release of the HD version was

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
I'm with you I'm with you fair enough

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000
I would be I would love to see

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000
Like some Playstation 1 games on there

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000
Or you know like Final Fantasy

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
Yeah they kind of stopped doing the PS1 games didn't they

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000
You know like Final Fantasy or something

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
They gave away Tactics at one point I think that was on PSP

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
Yeah I think they might have given away one of the older Final Fantasy games too

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000
Or they all went on sale or something

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000
So I don't know

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
Alright let's see Nvidia

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
Doing an update to what's called the Geforce

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
Experience this is that gameplay

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000
Optimization software and I've never used

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000
This because I have the AMD

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000
Or some ATI

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
Yeah I got a pop up this morning saying that I needed

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000
To update that and I'm like shit I didn't even

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
Know I had it so okay

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000
But I bring this up because one of the things

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000
They're going to be adding to this is that they're going to be able

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000
You're going to be able to capture gameplay

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000
If you have a 600 or a 700 series card

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000
So you can edit and you can upload

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000
And of course even more people now

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
Streaming their games on Twitch I mean this is becoming

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
A real huge thing which is

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000
You know as somebody who really loves independent broadcasting

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000
I mean I do kind of love it but at the same time

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000
I'm like wow

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
It's going to be even more like competition

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
For watching

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000
Like if everybody's streaming who's watching

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000
So it's going to be very interesting but I do love that it makes it

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000
Very easy at least

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
And let's see there's also what they call shadow mode

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
Which will follow your gameplay and it will

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000
Save the last 10 to 20 minutes of action

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000
In a temporary buffer on your hard drive

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
And if you hit a hotkey you can save

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000
The buffered footage and that way

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000
Your stuff doesn't pile up on the hard drive

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
There you go that's basically what we have on the next gen

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000
Yeah what the next gen consoles are doing they're starting to catch

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000
This up a little bit

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000
But it's 10 to 20 minutes and not you know

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000
I would imagine it's whatever you have available

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000
On your drive too

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000
So

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000
Most likely

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000
So there it is

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000
Some folks are going to be checking that out

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000
I'm pretty sure ATI is only a matter of time before they have a response

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
To this and their own thing

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
If they don't already

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000
Exactly

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000
I can't watch your channel because I'm streaming on my channel

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000
Yeah

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
It's going to be that

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000
Eventually there's not going to be anyone to view these channels

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000
Because everyone's going to be streaming their games

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000
And clogging the internet

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000
And it's all one site too

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000
Which is fascinating to me

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000
I mean I know there's like Ustream and a couple others

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000
But it's really fascinating to me that like one company

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000
Has such a huge share of this

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000
Clearly they must be using those

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
Microsoft cloud azure servers

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000
Or something

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000
Alright let's travel to a time

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000
When gaming was a little more simple

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000
If you wanted to see a hot new video game

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000
You had to go over to your rich friend's house and watch

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
That's what you had to do

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
You had to sit on the couch and watch them play

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000
Or if you wanted to see streaming

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000
You had to do it through a VHS tape

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
If you wanted to see streaming you went to the lake

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000
Alright

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
It is the classic game of the week

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000
Every week Dark Sakura steps into the gaming vault

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000
And finds a game that she thinks

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000
Hey brat

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000
Get off my lawn and play this game

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000
Get off my lawn, get off twitch

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000
Sit down, blow on this cartridge

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
And check this game out

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
Dark Sakura what is the classic game of the week

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
The classic game of the week is Adventures of Lolo

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
Which I think Dan suggested as a joke

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000
But it actually was kind of fun

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
This game was great

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000
It had good music

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000
Why would you suggest it as a joke

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000
I was just like pick something Dan

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000
He's like I don't know Adventure Lolo

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000
I'm like okay sure

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000
Here's the music

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000
Even Loki's head bobbing a little bit

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000
I play this game

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000
I know I used to love this game

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000
It is a great game

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000
Anyway in the Adventures of Lolo

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000
Basically his sweetie Lala

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000
Is captured by the villain

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000
King Egger

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000
So Lolo's like bitch you give me back my woman

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000
And he watches right up to the castle

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000
And kicks the door down

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000
And says I'm not taking your shit

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.000
You know I don't seem to remember it going that way

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000
That's my version so much

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000
The Dark Sakura version

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000
And then he sets the castle on fire

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000
Yeah

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000
And then he and Lolo

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.000
Make little round babies

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000
Lala

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.000
Somehow Lolo became

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000
Gay in your version

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000
Would that be

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000
Auto-gay

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000
And that's how

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000
Kirby was made

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000
God

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000
We're going to break

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000
I'm done

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000
So yeah you basically go through the stages

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000
You get harder and harder

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
Every four rooms you get to go upwards

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
Closer to his victory

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000
His sweet sweet victory

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000
And if you get stuck on a stage

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000
You have the option of dying

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
Which was great

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000
God dammit death

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000
So you commit suicide when you're done with life

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000
SSG100Matt in our chatroom at live.vognitework.com

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000
Says Lolo the game with its own suicide button

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
Exactly

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000
So you can destroy the enemies

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000
And shoot at them and you turn them into movable eggs

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000
And when you shoot the egg

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000
It disappears

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
Now the game was produced

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000
I'm sorry developed by HAL Laboratory

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000
And published by HAL America

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
For the NES

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000
And it came out on April 20th

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000
The day after my birthday

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000
Remember it everybody and get me stuff

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
420 it's not hard to remember

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000
In 1989

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000
And it came out in Europe in February 1991

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000
So they had to wait two whole years for Lolo

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000
It is now out

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000
On Wii's Virtual Console

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000
As of June 8th, 2007

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000
And August 6th, 2007 in the PAL regions

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000
It is the only game

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000
In the series not to have come out in Japan

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000
However Lolo 2 and Lolo 3 did

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000
It's just a fun little adventure game

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000
It's cute

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000
It gets kind of frustrating

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000
Later on

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000
But it's a fun game

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000
And it's one that's pretty much held up

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000
I played probably more of Lolo 2

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000
Than the first one

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000
Or the third one

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000
Because by the third one it came out I was like I don't care

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000
But I always had fun with it

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000
I've always loved little

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000
Spatial puzzle games like that

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000
You know the little enemies running around

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000
Well like your gaming week you've been playing Bejeweled and

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000
Fractal it's a bunch of the same type of

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000
Puzzle games

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000
I fucking love Fractal

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000
I wish it was 10 years later

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.000
So I could do Fractal

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000
As my classic game

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000
It's like instant fucking classic you have no idea

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000
Going back to Lolo and Lala

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000
It's a fun game

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.000
I mean basically

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000
Like I said Lolo 2 and Lolo 3

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000
Came out in 90 and 91 respectively

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000
There's a Game Boy version that came out in 1994

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000
That came out

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.000
With the same name Adventures of Lolo

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000
In Japan it came out as Lolo no

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000
No

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000
Lolo no Daibouken

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000
Lolo and Lala did appear

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000
In Kirby's Dreamland Rob

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.000
And in Kirby Superstar

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000
As Lolo and Lala

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000
And in Kirby's Avalanche

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.000
As Lolo and Lala where they are antagonists

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.000
I thought it was funny

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.000
That you were making the Kirby joke earlier

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.000
But act deaf yeah I was bringing up that same thing in our chat room

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000
And it was making me think as well

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000
I was like well yeah both these games were made

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000
Both Kirby and Lolo were HAL laboratories

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000
And if you think about it too

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000
I always thought that the little

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.000
Blue critter in

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000
Guardian Legend was Lolo

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000
Yes but it's

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000
It's not

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000
It's from that shooter game

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000
Not Xanax

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000
I keep thinking like Xanax

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000
Is it Xanax?

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000
Yeah I think it's Xanax

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000
The little lunar lander

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000
Yeah that's what I thought

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000
But before I was familiar with Xanax

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000
I often thought that it was

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000
Lolo

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000
I mean I guess having a blue puff ball

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000
With legs you know

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000
You can't get too uh

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:58.000
Too far away from that so

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000
So anyway that's uh

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000
According to act deaf they also appeared in the Kirby anime

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.000
So yay

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.000
So are you

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000
Oh you're looking it up?

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000
Well I'm trying to remember what that little thing was called

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.000
And somebody in the chat room

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.000
What is the name of the little blue fucker?

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000
I don't know how to spell Xanax that's why

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000
It's Z-A-M-A-C

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000
That was the game

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000
What was that little fucker called?

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000
Yeah his name was little fucker

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000
It was, that's Lolo and Lala's

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000
True uh, that's Lolo's love child

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.000
They're twins I swear to god

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000
But they're from different companies cause Xanax was an

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000
FCI game

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000
Or compile, it was compile

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000
But FCI published it

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000
Wasn't FCI like the publisher?

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000
Or was compile, compile was the developer

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000
Compile developed, FCI published

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000
In North America

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000
In Japan Xanax was published by

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000
Pony Canyon, but you know what the segment is about

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000
That's what Pony Canyon has done

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.000
PORN

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000
At least they're not pink pineapple

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000
You know

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000
You were talking about the classic game of the week

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000
Adventures of Lolo and now we're talking about

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000
PORN

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000
Only here at Orange Lones area

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000
Well I'm sure somewhere there's a Lolo shaped vibrator or something

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.000
I don't know

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.000
This is after you made Lolo gay and set the castle on fire

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.000
No! Auto gay

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000
Alright whatever

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.000
He is only, he's uh

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.000
Self sexual

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.000
Or would it be auto sexual?

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000
Are you done?

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000
I'm trying to think of what the politically correct term would be now

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000
I think it's auto sexual

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.000
I'm gonna be thinking about this all during the break

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.000
I just love that it's to this music

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.000
PORN

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000
PORN

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.000
PORN

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000
Hey this is a wonderful clip for the highlight show

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.000
I love you guys okay?

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.000
Alright

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.000
Cause I wouldn't have thought up all this fucked up shit if not for you

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.000
I love you too are you fucking done?

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000
I'm fucking done god damn it

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000
The classic game of the week

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.000
I think it was Adventures of Lolo

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000
But it might have been Xanac

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000
So

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000
It's always the guardian legend every episode

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000
Alright that's it

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000
We're gonna take a break

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000
Yes I agree with Queen Simia

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000
Just narcissistic

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000
Stay classy part A

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.000
Live.vognetwork.com

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000
Alright and what's this?

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000
Dark Tetsuya says wow it took an hour and a half

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.000
To get to the porn talk. Sit down be quiet

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000
Alright we're gonna take a quick break

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.000
Guys when we come back we have plenty more of

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.000
Orange Lounge Radio up next

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000
Rapid Fire News the Fugal Question of the Week

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.000
Emails and your phone calls

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.000
1-877-GAME-OLR

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.000
When we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000
Right after this

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:42.000
Music

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000
Welcome back everybody to Orange

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.000
Lounge Radio we are

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.000
live on this Sunday night October

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000
the 20th of 2013 with the

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.000
524th episode

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000
of our show you know next week

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.000
that means it's episode 525

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000
which might mean something

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.000
but cause it's a multiple of 25

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000
and it's a palindrome

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000
but I guess we don't really do anything to celebrate

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000
I don't know what else to do

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000
it would be the Halloween show

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000
I would say we could do like a specially themed Halloween show

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.000
but we never have so why start now

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.000
I don't know

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.000
what would we do

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:18.000
sit here and play Silent Hill during the show

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:20.000
I don't know if that would be as effective

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000
alright go to our channel

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.000
live.vognetwork.com some people

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.000
guessing the songs we were playing during the break

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.000
now for you folks listening on the podcast

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000
obviously you can't hear the copyrighted songs

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.000
we played during break but tonight for the

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000
live participants I promised some obscure

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.000
stuff cause I didn't want to just play like

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.000
Mega Man and Zelda and all the stuff

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.000
you guys know but I did some

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000
slightly obscure stuff tonight and for

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.000
those playing at home like if you're not in chat

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000
but you are listening live you had Terranigma

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000
started that off the middle

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.000
song nobody got that's because it was from

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.000
Cold Sept which was the

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.000
that was that card battle game meets Monopoly

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.000
I should have noticed that because you know I remember

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000
you playing that game yeah I'm like the one guy

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.000
that liked that game and then the

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:02.000
third song that we played tonight was from

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:04.000
Intelligent Cube or IQ

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.000
remember that on the Playstation 1

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.000
there you go those are the songs we had there

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.000
and I was looking at the chatroom

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000
props to Orange Wright I'll say your name on

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.000
air because you got he's the only one that

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.000
knew 2 of the 3 which is a pretty good score

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.000
I didn't see anybody else really shout things out there

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.000
let's see

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.000
also in the chatroom at live.vognetwork.com

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:24.000
before we get back into the news here

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:26.000
Akuma JP says I have a request

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:28.000
for Sky please do the

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:30.000
Cookie Monster voice and I'm like

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.000
I don't do a when did I do a Cookie

Monster voice I've done the Grover

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.000
I've done Grover I've done near

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000

say as Cookie Monster and Akuma JP says

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.000
I don't know porn porn porn

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000
and I'm thinking is he thinking of that

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000
song the internet is for

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.000
porn like is he thinking of that one that's

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000
not really Cookie Monster that's that's

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:56.000
the rip off Avenue Q style

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:58.000
thing I don't know I'm still mad I missed

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000
that when it was in town I know you know

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.000
it'll come back you know what they have at our local

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.000
theater down in Folsom right now

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.000
they have

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000
the stage production of

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000
Evil Dead the Musical oh nice

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.000
with the splash zone with all the blood

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.000
I'm like dude that's awesome

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.000
yeah I've seen the shadow cast

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000
troop here does that for Repo the genetic opera

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000
with the movie that's pretty awesome

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.000
and then I was looking actually another

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.000
big stage show this time of year the Rocky Horror

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.000
show and that was also brought

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.000
up during the break is that Rageinator said

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.000
he found this game that has my

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.000
name written all over it it's the actual

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.000
Rocky Horror video game that they

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000
made there was actually two I don't know if you guys know this

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:38.000
there were two Rocky Horror show games

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:40.000
neither were the picture show

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.000
I think they're both based on the play the first

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:44.000
one was like on the Commodore 64

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.000
and Apple 2e it was kind of like an adventure

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.000
game where you walk around and you're trying to find like the

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.000
transducer or something you can play as Brad or Janet

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:52.000
it's not good it's really not good

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.000
like there's a reason why most people

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:56.000
telltale games should do an adventure

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.000
game based on it wouldn't that be something

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000
well in the 90s the late 90s

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.000
there was a revival of Rocky

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.000
Horror show

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.000
in London yes and they did

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:08.000
a CD-ROM game

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.000
inspired by the 80s classic

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.000
that went with that and it also

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.000
wasn't very good because it was inspired

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.000
by the 80s classic which in turn

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.000
that was not good the one with the blonde Frank

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.000
yes yeah yeah because

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000
not everybody wants to look like Tim Curry necessarily

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.000
for the record before I

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:26.000
forget coming up in a couple of

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.000
weeks at my college

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.000
there's going to be another production of the Rocky Horror show

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.000
oh really it's a touring production

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000
I'll get the info for you I sent you the hairspray

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.000
one this is the time if you're going to

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000
time warp now's the time to do it I did also send you one

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.000
for hairspray I do remember seeing that

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:42.000
that's right I know how you love

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.000
John Waters things alright I do love John Waters

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000
things but like let's be real they're never

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.000
going to do Pink Flamingos live unless it involves

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.000
unless it involves drag queens

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:52.000
which then anything goes

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:54.000
right maybe we can write to

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:56.000
Peaches Christ alright maybe

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.000
I'm sure I'm sure

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.000
she's done some John Waters movie

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:02.000
but anyway this is not a show

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:04.000
about John Waters films as badly

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.000
as I wish it was sometimes this

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.000
is a show about video games and we have some

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.000
rapid fire news to get to

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.000
sadly no John Waters movies being made into

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.000
video games but I think there's some other stuff

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.000
um so yeah there's

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:18.000
been some news regarding the Oculus

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.000
Rift um the consumer version

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.000
of the Oculus Rift

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:24.000
still no firm date on that

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.000
yet but it's supposed to be out sometime

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.000
next year um

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.000
one of the other things they're looking at is maybe in the future

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.000
also switching those displays

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.000
that are inside of it to 4K displays

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:36.000
so that would probably look pretty realistic

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:38.000
especially for some PC games

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000
um so that's pretty exciting

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:42.000
um

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.000
anyways

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000
there's a brand new game from one of the

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.000
um designers that used to

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.000
work at Harmonix and it's

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.000
kind of silly it's actually uh this

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.000
indie studio called No Goblin

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.000
and they have a game called

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.000
Roundabout and Roundabout's basically

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:00.000
this limo driving game where

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.000
you're a chauffeur of a limo and you have to get through

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.000
busy streets but the limo is always

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.000
spinning and so you have to

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.000
dodge traffic you do

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.000
run over a lot of people to like do different

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.000
things like you know deliver kittens

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.000
to orphans or you know

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.000
uh run over the orphans on the way

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.000
why does that why am I

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:20.000
reminded of that the kittens are safe

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.000
why am I reminded of that no breaks

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.000
valet game it's sort of the only

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.000
thing to play on the Ouya it's sort of like an evolution

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.000
yeah of that

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.000
or revolution if you will

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000
uh it looks

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.000
it looks silly and um

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.000
I don't know I think that

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.000
yeah it's it's due out next

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.000
year um although they're taking

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.000
pre-orders for it right now at ten dollars

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.000
normally it's gonna be fifteen and that includes a digital

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.000
art book and soundtrack and

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:48.000
I guess it's like seventies themed as well it's set in

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.000
1977

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.000
um it looks funny

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:54.000
so yeah definitely check that

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.000
video if you haven't seen it yet and

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.000
uh last but not least there's a brand

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.000
new Minecraft mod and

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.000
it's involved or involving

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.000
quantum physics it's uh

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.000
called Qcraft

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.000
and allows I guess

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000
players to do different things including like um

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.000
they have different blocks with quantum

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.000
entanglements um

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000
I guess they're saying that uh

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:18.000
observer dependency characteristics

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000
see this is all stuff that's

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.000
over my head um

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.000
cool

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.000
I don't really know what exactly that means since

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000
I'm not really into quantum physics but uh

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000
I like Minecraft

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000
mods so let's let's dabble

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000
with that

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000
alright why not

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.000
Minecraft will be one of the

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:40.000
launch games on Playstation 4 right?

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:42.000
yeah that is kind of neat

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.000
so quantum physics in uh

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000
Playstation 4 maybe?

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000
alright let's go on to some other news stories

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000
uh Pokémon X and Y I talked about earlier

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:52.000
in the show my first uh couple

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000
couple hours in that world well some people

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.000
some people already beat the game

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.000
Shane if you're out there listening

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.000
and others I think ActDeft was saying he was on the

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.000
final four well there was a lot of

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.000
people there was a lot of people playing X and Y

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.000
over four million copies in

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:08.000
two days moved of Pokémon X and Y

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:10.000
Nintendo's going

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.000
bankrupt you guys the Wii U's gonna

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.000
bankrupt Nintendo everybody

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.000
they're gonna be making games

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.000
for the Playstation 99 cent iPhone

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.000

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.000
yeah four million copies

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.000
of Pokémon X and Y it's just these

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000
games print money there they go

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.000
and uh yeah uh they say

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.000
by the way that Pokémon X and Y tracking

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:32.000
ahead of Pokémon White 2

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.000
and Black 2 by more than 70%

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.000
well that's because White 2

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.000
and Black 2 were obvious cash-ins this

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.000
at least is a little more you know effort of a

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000
cash-in let's be real alright

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000
uh other stuff I love that

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.000
they are still making DLC

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:48.000

because it is that time of year and

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.000

for this Rob you don't even have to play LittleBigPlanet

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.000
you can play LittleBigPlanet Karting and still have

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:08.000
that stuff in there too nice you did

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:10.000
see what Victoria happened to mention

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:12.000
yes it's the 20th anniversary

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.000
I know you know how I want to

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.000
celebrate this I want to bust out my

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.000
laserdisc player and watch

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.000
my laserdisc version I want to go over there

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000
and smack her for reminding me of that fact

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000
you know what you know what you know what

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.000
that means that we were out when all the cool shit came out

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:28.000
that's true that's true well I just

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.000
want to say though that according to the LittleBigPlanet

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:32.000
website the character is actually

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:34.000
named you ready for it?

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.000
Sack Skellington

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:42.000
shit alright uh

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:44.000
one more so what is Sally called

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.000
Saki I close the

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000
tab because I stopped caring I'm gonna buy

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.000
I'm gonna buy it anyway

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:52.000
okay calm down

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:54.000
calm your tits calm

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:56.000
them alright soccer

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.000
is freaking out because we have

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000
another story this is two weeks in a row now we're

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:02.000
talking about ColecoVision

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:04.000
because last week we

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.000
talked about that whole Kickstarter thing

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000
and I kind of said my

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.000
honest piece that I don't think they're gonna make their funding

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.000
but you know I hope prove me

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.000
wrong please do I would not be sad

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.000
however we have something else this is different

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.000
this is a different retro device

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.000
that's gonna bring back the ColecoVision

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.000
it's a retro hardware company

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:24.000
called AtGames and they're

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.000
gonna be launching these devices that are based on the

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:28.000
ColecoVision they already make Atari

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.000
and Sega Genesis based handhelds so

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.000
I'm assuming these are those shitty

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.000
little plug and play things you

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.000
see just littering one of the aisles

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:38.000
at Target right so soon you're gonna have a

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.000
shitty little ColecoVision thing too

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.000
but you know it won't be shitty because it's ColecoVision

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.000
I love my ColecoVision Rob

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.000
uh so there's that

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.000
so that is coming I guess soon all we know

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:50.000
they've acquired the rights

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.000
that they've got the deal we just don't know

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.000
when we don't know how but you can

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.000
assume soon I

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:58.000
would think they're trying to get this on the shelves before the holiday

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.000
because you've got you know people in

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:02.000
their mid 30s like Darsakra and me

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.000
who remember this shit from when

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.000
we were kids and it would be a great

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.000
thing to find you know under

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:10.000
the Christmas tree or menorah or whatever

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.000
under the menorah yeah there's a

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.000
menorah on top of a ColecoVision isn't that where

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:16.000
you put the gifts

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.000
that's how it works right where else are

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:20.000
they supposed to go no no

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:22.000
you have the Hanukkah bush

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:24.000
the gelt goes in my belly

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000
you know what though

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.000
it is kind of funny that Hanukkah

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:30.000
is the same week that Thanksgiving is

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:32.000
so I'm gonna make sweet potato pumpkin

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.000
latkes oh my god Hanukkah is that early this year

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.000
I know it's because

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:38.000
see they don't believe in solar calendars and

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:40.000
Judaism back in ancient

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:42.000
Israel we had the moon

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.000
stop complicating everything

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.000
you know what I didn't invent

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.000
I didn't invent the lunar calendar

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:50.000
these guys are just high maintenance that's what it really is

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.000
high maintenance

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:54.000
and I say that with love put the

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.000
angry emails down I tease because I love

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:58.000
I tell you what was absolutely hilarious was

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:00.000
when Christmas and Hanukkah were the same week

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.000
it was a nightmare in my house

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.000
because we were also moving

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:06.000
we had

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:08.000
blue stars and Christmas

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:10.000
presents everywhere so once in a while there's video game

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:12.000
talk on this show

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.000
Darsakra

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:16.000
oh yeah I got stories

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:18.000
well how about

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:20.000
a petition that is out

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.000
for the Grand Theft Auto 5 PC

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:24.000
version and it's at

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:26.000
change.org so you know it's an annoying piece of shit

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.000
however

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:30.000
you know what my problem with

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:32.000
change.org is all the damn emails

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:34.000
so anyway

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:36.000
they are over

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.000
600,000 supporters

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:40.000
to have a PC version released

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:42.000
and they have generated

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:44.000
as far as

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:46.000
the sales of the game goes

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.000
over a billion what was it in three days

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:50.000
so yeah it's made quite a bit of money

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:52.000
so there are also

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:54.000
sources in the industry saying that there should be a PC

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:56.000
version out early 2014

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:58.000
I was going to say

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:00.000
they're already making a PC version

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:02.000
they just haven't announced it yet because why would they cannibalize

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:04.000
the sales of the current versions

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:06.000
because people like to jump on bandwagon

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:08.000
especially if they know it's

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:10.000
going to happen

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:12.000
who doesn't like to come back and say

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:14.000
I was right

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:16.000
I totally called that

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:18.000
you guys I totally called that

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:20.000
how about all of us who said we totally called it without

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:22.000
signing a fucking petition

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:24.000
they're going to make Grand Theft Auto 6 you guys

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:26.000
I fucking called it here on OLR

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:28.000
also if you happen

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:30.000
to pre-order

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.000
Zelda A Link Between Worlds

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:34.000
you get a musical chest

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:36.000
it comes in a nice big box

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.000
now granted

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:40.000
this is

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:42.000
just for the US

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:44.000
this is buying the bundle version

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:46.000
the 3DS XL that comes with the game

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:48.000
it has

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:50.000
a golden Triforce cover

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:52.000
and A Link Between Worlds loaded on the console

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:54.000
and this was

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:56.000
already linked

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:58.000
from a

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.000
Gamestop Black Friday ad

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:02.000
so as far as

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:04.000
any type of European release

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.000
Game actually did confirm

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:08.000
that they're getting the

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:10.000
musical treasure chest as a pre-order bonus

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:12.000
so all of our friends

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:14.000
in the UK you're not screwed

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:16.000
this time

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:18.000
and

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:20.000
well

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:22.000
I don't know if I'm happy or sad Rob

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:24.000
because

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:26.000
well you're always happy to be in my presence

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:28.000
I know that

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:30.000
you know what

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:32.000
we have a little bit more news about the Mass Effect franchise

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:34.000
that will have a brand new story

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:36.000
completely unrelated to

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:38.000
The Shepherd or The Crew

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:40.000
or

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:42.000
any of them

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:44.000
so basically Bioware wants to take it in a new

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:46.000
direction

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:48.000
and they have said again

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:50.000
doesn't necessarily relate to The Shepherd

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:52.000
events whatsoever

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.000
but it has to be

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.000
Mass Effect Universe it's not just a spin-off

01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:58.000
it has to be a part of the series

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.000
so

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:02.000
but they said something similar

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:04.000
6 months ago and we all

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:06.000
accept it then right?

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:08.000
yeah

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:10.000
I don't know how I feel because

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:12.000
you know I used to back in the day I used to want

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:14.000
a Mass Effect MMO I thought it would be

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:16.000
fantastic to play in that universe

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:18.000
to go around and hang out on the

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:20.000
different worlds and do stuff and maybe if it was something

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:22.000
kinda

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:24.000
kinda more like that

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:26.000
where it wasn't just all the human centric

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:28.000
bullshit that was you know Mass Effect 3

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.000
then I would be completely

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:32.000
okay with that but at this point

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:34.000
I don't necessarily trust what Bioware

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:36.000
is going to do so I'm probably

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:38.000
still gonna buy it because I'm a whore

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:40.000
sigh

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:42.000
I don't know

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:44.000
alright

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:46.000
I'm still looking forward to it

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:48.000
because you know it's Mass Effect and

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:50.000
it'll be great you know what I want

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:52.000
Turians the game

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:54.000
Queen Simeon is in our chatroom

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:56.000
at live.vognetwork.com and says still needs

01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:58.000
Turians and Krogan

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:00.000
Alan Alchemy says it can't

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:02.000
be a sequel that takes place in the

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:04.000
same universe unless it's literally thousands

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:06.000
of years later because otherwise they'll have to

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:08.000
pick a canon ending between the red blue

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:10.000
green horse shit and that would be bad

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:12.000
well they did pick a canon ending

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:14.000
for part 2 didn't they

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.000
you wouldn't have had a 3 if they went with a bad ending

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:18.000
and 2 everyone dies

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.000
oh my god have you watched that

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.000
oh yeah it's great it's hilarious I mean it's sad

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.000
but it's hilarious the YouTube of the

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:26.000
Mass Effect 2 bad ending or whatever which is

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:28.000
the everybody dies ending OMG spoilers

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:30.000
for a 4 year old game

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:32.000
they have the shepherd the thing that makes

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:34.000
that video funny is they have like the ugliest shepherd

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:36.000
possible at least the one I saw

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:38.000
have you seen the the ones that

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:40.000
that have hacked it to give shepherd

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.000
garris a skeleton

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:44.000
yes that was creepy

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:46.000
there's another one that did that to give Jacob

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.000
garris a skeleton and they just got this huge mouth

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:50.000
it's so fucking weird

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.000
um and

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:54.000
yeah raginator asks so no

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:56.000
more garris they

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:58.000
won't garris all the things I won't garris

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:00.000
all the things does this make dark sakura

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:02.000
a sad panda dark sakura is kind of getting

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:04.000
over some of her attachment in the

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:06.000
fandom so and also speaking

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:08.000
of herself in the third person

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:10.000
so at this point I would actually

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:12.000
like a new series that has

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:14.000
characters that I'm attached to but not like

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:16.000
singularly attached to I would like

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:18.000
to be able to explore more options

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:20.000
instead of having just the one freaking awesome option

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:22.000
so

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:24.000
alright I'm sorry I wasn't into

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:26.000

01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:58.000

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:00.000

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:12.000
clicker is a free to play web game that has been found

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:14.000
to be pretty addicting for some and it's

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:16.000
inspired parodies like I don't know if you saw but

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:18.000
there's a clicking bad

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:20.000
which is it replaces cookie clickers with

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:22.000
bad references so you're cooking meth

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:24.000
and you get like rvs

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:26.000
and abandoned trailers and all this

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:28.000

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:50.000

unfolded raptor says I've never been able to

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:00.000
get into facebook games but I spent many hours

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:02.000
on super mario brothers crossover and

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:04.000
happy wheels there used to be this really

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:06.000
fun flash game on disney.com based on

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:08.000
their version of tarzan many years ago

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:10.000
it was really fluid and fun to play I was a kid

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:12.000
but I'd still go back and play it now

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:14.000
uh our good buddy from koopa

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:16.000
club renee says there

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:18.000
are a few free to play games I've enjoyed over the years

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:20.000
but the best one being the kingdom

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:22.000
of loathing simple interface

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:24.000
much like clicking bad but totally

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:26.000
aloof and light hearted fantasy story

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:28.000
especially when you can be a

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:30.000
pasta mancer or a saucer roar

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:32.000
and it's been running for 10 years even I've

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:34.000
played the kingdom of loathing for a hot minute like I

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:36.000
think a lot of people check this game out and it's a

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:38.000
fun one I haven't oh you should check it out

facebook it's a game in which you play

slot games and table games in order to earn

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:50.000
points that can be spent on real

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:52.000
vegas rewards like a drink at the

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:54.000

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:24.000
did it just come out I wonder if they're doing a new tour

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:26.000
that's what I wanted to see I'm pissed

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:28.000
off cause I had to say no to a pet shop boys concert

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:30.000
for free cause I had

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:32.000
fucking homework to do

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:34.000
worst day ever it was in

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:36.000
oakland and everything alright

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:38.000
critical myth says at one point

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:40.000
there was a sardicus clicky game on

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:42.000
facebook I was fairly addicted to

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:44.000
and I was playing a game called equilibrium

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:46.000
on my vita for weeks earlier

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:48.000
this year

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:50.000
raginator says to be honest I never

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:52.000
got into the free to play web game scene

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:54.000
wah wah

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:56.000
now I know

01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:58.000
it's not exactly the same thing and this answer really

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:00.000
doesn't fit the question but the closest thing that sorts

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:02.000
of fits is pc gaming in general be it

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:04.000
on steam game for windows live or whatever

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:06.000
and the vod community already well knows

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:08.000
I've traditionally been a console gamer and a console

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:10.000
gaming fanboy since 1981

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:12.000
and for the longest time would have scoffed

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:14.000
the idea of pc gaming it wasn't

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:16.000
until the theft last year on my original laptop

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:18.000
my ps3 and tv that I

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:20.000
got into pc gaming albeit

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:22.000
begrudgingly if only because I couldn't afford to replace

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:24.000
my tv and ps3 now

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:26.000
I thoroughly enjoy pc gaming

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:28.000
well raginator go check out some of these links people

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:30.000
are leaving and you can fill up your pc with

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:32.000
crap

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:34.000
uh austin s says

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:36.000
oh and I'm sure we've all played this one being music game

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:38.000
fans we are ffr

01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:40.000
flash flash revolution it was a web

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:42.000
based step mania game I used

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:44.000
to play it a lot back in the day but it's dated now

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:46.000
fair enough

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:48.000
alright let's go on to google plus

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:50.000
we have a couple answers there

01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:52.000
actdeft says mostly facebook

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:54.000
games I used to play them a lot but I

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:56.000
eventually got tired of them like song pop or even

01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:58.000
you don't know jack I do play the occasional

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:00.000
bejeweled bullets and tenders friends

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:02.000
and lastly

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:04.000
rettertainment says yes the sims on facebook

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:06.000
I never spent a cent on it and got

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:08.000
really far in it until I got a girlfriend

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:10.000
and started having sex in the game

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:12.000
then I got oddly disinterested

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:14.000
weird I also started playing

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:16.000
the sims freeplay on my ipad until I found

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:18.000
that I couldn't play it at work because I wasn't connected to the internet

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:20.000
that's stupid the game

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:22.000
is downloaded on my ipad and the file size is

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:24.000
mighty large why can't my save be

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:26.000
on the ipad as well

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:28.000
I guess because it's harder to take your money

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:30.000
if you're not connected to the internet

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:32.000
alright bye erasure

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:34.000
I'll miss you

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:36.000
you totally should use this every time

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:38.000
for the segment now I kind of want to

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:40.000
alright there it is our frugal

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:42.000
question of the week I'll quickly

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:44.000
ask are there any free to play games

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:46.000
maybe that weren't brought up that you've been getting into

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:48.000
lately or even in the past

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:50.000
cookie clicker is definitely mine they have

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:52.000
an iphone it's not official though

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:54.000
it's a follow up to horde house

01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:56.000
the iphone one is cookie

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:58.000
clickers and it's a

01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:00.000
knock off game it's still pretty good

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:02.000
but it's not official there is an official one

01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:04.000
in the making just to say

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:06.000
I can't remember really

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:08.000
the last free one that I did

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:10.000
because remember

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:12.000
when I got my ikade

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:14.000
I kind of went on a purchasing spree

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:16.000
which I probably shouldn't have done

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:18.000
oops

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:20.000
yeah all the ones

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:22.000
that I actually still have on my phone

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:24.000
are

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:26.000
ones I paid for

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:28.000
I mean I'm actually looking at

01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:30.000
my folder now

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:32.000
I have a robot

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:34.000
unicorn and I played for that

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:36.000
droplets I paid for that

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:38.000
yeah everything

01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:40.000
on here I paid for

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:42.000
so no nothing free

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:44.000
Loki what about you

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:46.000
I don't think there's really been anything that I've played

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:48.000
for free aside from that time

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:50.000
when I was doing the whole ready

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:52.000
player one thing where I had to play that really shitty

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:54.000
garage sale

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:56.000
game on Facebook

01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:58.000
oh god but I didn't necessarily

01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:00.000
want to play that it was

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:02.000
did that guy really win that DeLorean or whatever

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:04.000
yeah he did there was a guy that won the DeLorean

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:06.000
because he got

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:08.000
the world record in Joust

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:10.000
I think of the 2600 wow

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:12.000
alright grats to him I guess

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:14.000
alright more

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:16.000
stories coming your way up now Loki

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:18.000
yeah no

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:20.000
no DeLorean for me that's right

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:22.000
it probably would have been more

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:24.000
you wouldn't have wanted to

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:26.000
pay the taxes on it

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:28.000
well the taxes and then on top of that

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:30.000
servicing the thing the only service center that

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:32.000
does DeLoreans

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:34.000
at least around here is in LA

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:36.000
so that wouldn't be very convenient

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:38.000
um okay

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:40.000
so let's talk a little bit about the PlayStation 4

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:42.000
hey you want to check out a PlayStation

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:44.000
4 well there's going to be some demo kiosks

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:46.000
coming soon to

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:48.000
Sony stores, GameStop, Target

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:50.000
Walmart and Best Buy

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:52.000
and uh

01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:54.000
they have a website that you can actually go to

01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:56.000
to see where they are at if

01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:58.000
you go to it's the experience

01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:00.000
playstation.com and

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:02.000
you put in your zip code and they'll show

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:04.000
you a map with all the different

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:06.000
stores that are

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:08.000
you know supplying it

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:10.000
and um

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:12.000
we have none there is absolutely

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:14.000
none in our area so I noticed

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:16.000
Best Buy is making a lot of room for both the

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:18.000
PlayStation 4 and the Xbox although on the whole

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:20.000
on the whole it seems like Best Buy

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:22.000
has really scaled back their gaming sections

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:24.000
I guess in

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:26.000
favor of other stuff and some of the things

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:28.000
we've been hearing about the company you know on

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:30.000
CNN or other new sites where the margins

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:32.000
are bigger cause gaming isn't it

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:34.000
that's for sure I guess so

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:36.000
so yeah and then

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:38.000
it's a little

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:40.000
I don't understand this

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:42.000
to be honest and this is basically

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:44.000
you can pre-order

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:46.000
digital downloads of

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:48.000
PlayStation 4 launch titles

01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:50.000
look if you're willing to give them your

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:52.000
credit card they'll take it on the

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:54.000
PlayStation 3 and

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:56.000
guess what you get for doing that

01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:58.000
no discount

01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:00.000
so why the

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:02.000
fuck would you do that because you want

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:04.000
to be able to play that shit day one

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:06.000
even though if you're gonna have to

01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:08.000
go and download it anyways so

01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:10.000
go and pick up your PlayStation 4 somewhere unless

01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:12.000
Amazon's bringing it to you let's put it this way

01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:14.000
ok yeah I know that you can partially download

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:16.000
the game and then you can start playing it

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:18.000
once you've downloaded the game but

01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:20.000
the thing is these

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:22.000
downloads are fucking huge remember we

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:24.000
mentioned on a couple shows back they had

01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:26.000
this NBA Ultimate

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:28.000
Fan Pack or Super Fan Pack

01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:30.000
or something like that it's basically digital versions of the

01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:32.000
current gen and next gen versions of the game

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:34.000
the next gen versions of the game

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:36.000
were like 60 gigabytes to download

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:38.000
and I'm

01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:40.000
sorry but there's

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:42.000
you want to do that just go to retail

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:44.000
and buy the game yeah you may have to pay taxes

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:46.000
on it but just go

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:48.000
buy it or hey here's a wonderful

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:50.000
idea maybe wait until Black Friday and see if they

01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:52.000
discount that shit

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:54.000
might be something you know

01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:56.000
I don't know there's just no reason

01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:58.000
I can see the pre-order

01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:00.000
a game unless you get something

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:02.000
I mean cause so far they haven't really said

01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:04.000
anything it says I guess the only

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:06.000
game that you can pre-order that seems like you get

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:08.000
something for is

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:10.000
Warframe which is free

01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:12.000
so I don't understand that at all

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:14.000
but it's free and I guess you get some

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:16.000
in-game money and exclusive weapon skin

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:18.000
so sure why not go pre-order that if you're

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:20.000
going to give it to PlayStation 4

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:22.000
in case you want to play it cause it's free so

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:24.000
but as far as

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:26.000
Nack you know

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:28.000
Killzone or something like that

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:30.000
unless there's charge I mean like

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:32.000
you know $53.99 or

01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:34.000
some sort of discount there I just don't see

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:36.000
a reason to pre-order

01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:38.000
anything for a

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:40.000
digital download I mean

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:42.000
fuck if you want to do a digital download

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:44.000
and you decide that you want to do that

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:46.000
do it at launch day make that decision on launch day

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:48.000
not necessarily

01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:50.000
Well it just goes back to that old thing we were talking about

01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:52.000
way back when the Xbox One was rumored to have

01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:54.000
all these restrictions it's like what's the benefit

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:56.000
of going digital? It's not like they're not going to have

01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:58.000
a digital copy for you it's not like

01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:00.000
they're going to sell out a digital copy

01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:02.000
of a game I mean

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:04.000
it just doesn't make any sense

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:06.000
Alright they just want

01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:08.000
a really easy way for you to hit the button

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:10.000
and they can charge the card and give you

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:12.000
make another sale really easy

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:14.000
that's what this is all about nothing more

01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:16.000
I think you're thinking too much about it

01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:18.000
Logie

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:20.000
Alright well this game fell off

01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:22.000
our radar years ago and

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:24.000
the last time we were talking about this video game

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:26.000
I think we were exclusively a show about

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:28.000
music based video games

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:30.000
this game was being developed for an arcade

01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:32.000
release in 2005

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:34.000
I don't know if you guys remember when we were talking about

01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:36.000
a game called Neon FM

01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:38.000
remember this? Because it had

01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:40.000
like freeze pop and it had some really other

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:42.000
like kind of questionably

01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:44.000
good songs in it well it's been a

01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:46.000
long time obviously and this game has kind of

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:48.000
reinvented itself a little bit because

01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:50.000
Unit E is the

01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:52.000
group now that's putting this arcade cabinet out

01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:54.000
I think I heard a rumor once that at one point

01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:56.000
Betson who ended up doing the DDR

01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:58.000
cabinets years later was going to do this

01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:00.000
game and they didn't so now Unit E

01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:02.000
is doing this and it's no longer

01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:04.000
a dance game that's the other big change

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:06.000
it is now a I guess

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:08.000
to me it would strike me more as like pop

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:10.000
music because it's got the big

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:12.000
circular pads that you hit

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:14.000
it was originally supposed to be played

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:16.000
the same way except the dance pad would look like

01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:18.000
what that pad looks like right there

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:20.000
it was like 3 on the bottom 2 on the top it wasn't

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:22.000
like your typical DDR dance pad

01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:24.000
it was like Beatmania with your feet

01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:26.000
right

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:28.000
so yeah so Neon FM

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:30.000
is apparently now like a thing

01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:32.000
there's a video out there you can

01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:34.000
see it on YouTube and so forth

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:36.000
but is girls

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:38.000
butts in it and it is because I can see

01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:40.000
that in the screenshot apparently it is

01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:42.000
the song is so

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:44.000
awful that song is horrible

01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:46.000
but I think by now it probably gets the joke

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:48.000
vote right no

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:50.000
it's still awful so apparently

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:52.000
it is still on target for release this

01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:54.000
year to show up in arcades

01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:56.000
that is if you still have an arcade near

01:59:56.000 --> 01:59:58.000
you that contains games that don't shoot

01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:00.000
out tickets I will say the cabinet

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:02.000
does look nice I hope this does show up in an arcade

02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:04.000
you know what the best ticket game ever is

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:06.000
Giant Tetris

02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:08.000
I would say either Spider Stomp or

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:10.000
Giant Tetris no the one where

02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:12.000
you have those little like the balls that

02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:14.000
you see in the McDonald's ball pit or whatever and you

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:16.000
throw them at the screen and break things on the monitor

02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:18.000
ok that is pretty cool that one is a lot of fun too

02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:20.000
because it involves breaking shit but I still love

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:22.000
Giant Tetris Giant Tetris is like a close

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:24.000
second yeah

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:26.000
but Neon FM no

02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:28.000
word if Neon FM will shoot out tickets I don't

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:30.000
believe it does but that's all

02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:32.000
they had to do if they wanted to make this game super popular

02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:34.000
just put a little ticket dispenser in it

02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:36.000
and the better you do on a song the more tickets you get

02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:38.000
yeah well being that

02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:40.000
based off step mania they could probably

02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:42.000
do that or if you play that horrible girls butt

02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:44.000
songs it will actually take your tickets

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:46.000
as like a penalty

02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:48.000
no if you play the girls

02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:50.000
butts then you get like

02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:52.000
kicked in the crotch I would laugh

02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:54.000
I would really laugh if they had

02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:56.000
like a game like that where the

02:00:56.000 --> 02:00:58.000
tickets would go in and out depending on how

02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:00.000
well you did I guess it would get all

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:02.000
fucked up though because you know if

02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:04.000
you tore it off

02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:06.000
then it goes back in well they should be in like a

02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:08.000
glass case that you can't get into

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:10.000
until the very end or it cuts it

02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:12.000
or something like it should be like

02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:14.000
look I'm going to give you all these no I'm not

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:16.000
I'm going to give you all these no I'm not have you ever

02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:18.000
worked at an arcade of course

02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:20.000
not I did

02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:22.000
why would I subject myself to that bullshit

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:24.000
one of my two of my first jobs involved

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:26.000
arcade games and I know for a damn fact

02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:28.000
someone would figure out how to get in there

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:30.000
my minimum wage job I already told you my minimum wage

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:32.000
job was I worked at a video store and we rented

02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:34.000
porn and that was awesome

02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:36.000
anyhow

02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:38.000
alright

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:40.000
whatever dark sorrow

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:42.000
what do you have for us for the news I have some shit

02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:44.000
no um

02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:46.000
blizzard has once again

02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:48.000
changed the name of

02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:50.000
what was blizzard all stars

02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:52.000
and is now heroes

02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:54.000
of the storm

02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:56.000
I don't know why the fuck they're calling it that

02:01:56.000 --> 02:01:58.000
but yeah they even are quoted saying yep we

02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:00.000
changed it again so

02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:02.000
um basically

02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:04.000
they've also said set aside whatever you

02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:06.000
think you knew about blizzard all stars

02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:08.000
and it's supposed to be um

02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:10.000
more about it will be revealed at

02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:12.000
Blizzcon November 8th and

02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:14.000
9th and uh

02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:16.000
there apparently is a trailer

02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:18.000
online so look for it

02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:20.000
I kind of

02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:22.000
am like whatever although I have to

02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:24.000
say that the picture on here of the

02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:26.000
um whoever the

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:28.000
uh orc is

02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:30.000
what am I saying orc uh

02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:32.000
whatever the fuck they're called

02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:34.000
god I played World of Warcraft for how long

02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:36.000
that looks like an orc yeah

02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:38.000
orc I'm just thinking ogre for some reason

02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:40.000
oh no it's an orc no the orc just

02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:42.000
looks absolutely hilarious so

02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:44.000
it's got a little cartoony vibe to it I will say

02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:46.000
though I actually think the new name is much better

02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:48.000
Blizzard all stars is a little dinky dinky

02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:50.000
yeah I mean I wonder if it's going to be

02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:52.000
cutesy like that though it opens it up to a

02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:54.000
bigger audience too because they're going to have to compete against

02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:56.000
all these other mobas that are already out there but

02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:58.000
you know I think um

02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:00.000
it's going to be interesting because I think

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:02.000
uh the heroes of the storm

02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:04.000
or whatever has the potential to draw

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:06.000
in a whole new audience to this

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:08.000
you know with their built in warcraft audience

02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:10.000
and the people that are running the hearthstone and all this

02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:12.000
I think it's going to be very interesting to see how

02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:14.000
that plays out I might check it out I've just been

02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:16.000
a little bit burned on all things

02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:18.000
blizzard I finally uninstalled curse

02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:20.000
did you? I did

02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:22.000
reminds me of playstation all stars

02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:24.000
well yeah but it's not going to play anything like that

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:26.000
it's going to be more like maybe that's why they changed the name

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:28.000
because it's going to be it's basically

02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:30.000
league of legends which is ironic because

02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:32.000
I would argue that it's not

02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:34.000
final fantasy 14 or any of those games

02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:36.000
that wow has lost its players

02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:38.000
to it's to league of legends

02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:40.000
I think wow's probably lost more players to league of legends

02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:42.000
than anything else so

02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:44.000
and sucking

02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:46.000
it's interesting that they're going to

02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:48.000
kind of have their own answer to league

02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:50.000
of legends now so we'll see how it works

02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:52.000
by the way can I ask you about something not to go on a horde house tangent

02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:54.000
but I'd love to know what you think

02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:56.000
what did you think about the uh

02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:58.000
siege of orgrimmar ending

02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:00.000
I like that it was different

02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:02.000
if you were alliance or horde

02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:04.000
but here's the thing

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:06.000
I hate to keep comparing it

02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:08.000
but I can't help myself like times

02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:10.000
have changed right like it's cool that you

02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:12.000
get a two and a half minute cinematic or whatever

02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:14.000
when you beat the game but over in final fantasy

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:16.000
14 like that ending was seriously like

02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:18.000
15 minutes long and it was very satisfying

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:20.000
and it was just

02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:22.000
I don't know like it kind of just made the warcraft

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:24.000
endings look a little bit like

02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:26.000
oh that's all you get for

02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:28.000
putting up with all the abuse you take in LFR

02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:30.000
but as far as like you know

02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:32.000
what went down story wise

02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:34.000
I don't know it's kind of obvious

02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:36.000
well I mean we knew he was going down but I was actually

02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:38.000
a little bit surprised at who took over

02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:40.000
I wasn't at all

02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:42.000
but I was actually

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:44.000
a little bit more surprised with

02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:46.000
Douchebag with Varian

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:48.000
so that was a little bit more what surprised me

02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:50.000
well I was also a little bit surprised that Jaina was so bloodthirsty

02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:52.000
in the ending too cause she's

02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:54.000
they're really trying to make her the alliance

02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:56.000
answer to Sylvanas

02:04:56.000 --> 02:04:58.000
they were really trying to do that

02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:00.000
it just doesn't suit the character I mean it didn't surprise me

02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:02.000
given you know having your whole town blown up

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:04.000
but at the same time

02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:06.000
it just seemed out of character for her

02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:08.000
anyway too much wow

02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:10.000
no no no I wanted to ask because

02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:12.000
that's fair it's a video game

02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:14.000
it is a video game we can talk about it

02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:16.000
you don't like it email us

02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:18.000
mailbag at orangesontrader.com stop talking about that stupid game

02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:20.000
alright Loki

02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:22.000
so Ubisoft

02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:24.000
has adjusted

02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:26.000
their financials and basically

02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:28.000
have deemed Splinter Cell

02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:30.000
Blacklist and Rayman Legends

02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:32.000
under performers

02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:34.000
and they said you know we've had games that were released

02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:36.000
for which we anticipate

02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:38.000
today lower sales than

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:40.000
we anticipated when we first gave our targets

02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:42.000
and already released games

02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:44.000
of course such as Splinter Cell

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:46.000
and Rayman and others

02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:48.000
you know also

02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:50.000
probably doesn't help too as we mentioned earlier

02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:52.000
they delayed Watch Dogs and the crew

02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:54.000
so

02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:56.000
I don't know what could they have done

02:05:56.000 --> 02:05:58.000
better

02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:00.000
I just don't think there was a lot of interest

02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:02.000
in Splinter Cell Blacklist like they thought

02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:04.000
like everyone was kind of hyped up about it

02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:06.000
I think at E3 and it was just kind of

02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:08.000
eh you know

02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:10.000
maybe because that's when the Grand Theft Auto

02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:12.000
train started or Saints Row 4

02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:14.000
coming out around the same time and stuff

02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:16.000
I don't know

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:18.000
maybe it's just I know the reviews

02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:20.000
weren't that fantastic for Blacklist

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:22.000
Rayman Legends looked good

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:24.000
but I guess a lot of people

02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:26.000
you know it would have been a better February

02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:28.000
title I think I think people saw right through

02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:30.000
what they did with Rayman Legends I think

02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:32.000
it's not that like pissing off the Nintendo

02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:34.000
fanboys had that big an impact but I think

02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:36.000
a lot of people saw right the people that would

02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:38.000
tend to buy games on day one see

02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:40.000
right through the fact that it was a Wii U

02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:42.000
game that was backed into the parking

02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:44.000
spot of a 360 place I understand that

02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:46.000
but what about the difference in

02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:48.000
you know had they released it just on Wii U

02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:50.000
what their potential sales are

02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:52.000
and even now like with the Wii U

02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:54.000
coming out you know version coming out in September

02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:56.000
versus February that's still a lot

02:06:56.000 --> 02:06:58.000
more you know months in between there

02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:00.000
and systems being sold that there's

02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:02.000
potential buyers I mean they kind

02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:04.000
of had to do that it was the logical way

02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:06.000
to do it they should have released the Wii U game

02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:08.000
the way they'd always planned and then they should have

02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:10.000
released the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3

02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:12.000
version later and called it

02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:14.000
a gold edition or an enhanced

02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:16.000
make it feel like an enhanced version

02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:18.000
not a scaled back version

02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:20.000
maybe or maybe just Nintendo

02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:22.000
wasn't giving them any money to make it exclusive

02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:24.000
and so you know there was no incentive

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:26.000
to do that maybe if they threw a little bit of

02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:28.000
money their way then they could have had another

02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:30.000
good exclusive title I don't think these games

02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:32.000
are necessarily damned though because you know

02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:34.000
it's gonna have staying power throughout the holidays

02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:36.000
I think again I said the people who will

02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:38.000
buy it on day one may be able to

02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:40.000
see right through it but you're still gonna have it's a very

02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:42.000
family accessible family friendly title

02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:44.000
you know I think Rayman does very well

02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:46.000
you know there's parents aren't

02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:48.000
afraid to buy that for their younger kids so I

02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:50.000
think that title can still tend to do well

02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:52.000
throughout the holidays I don't know I gotta be honest

02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:54.000
when I hear a story like this I think about

02:07:54.000 --> 02:07:56.000
just a few months ago we heard that

02:07:56.000 --> 02:07:58.000
Square Enix story about the guy getting up there

02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:00.000
saying Tomb Raider underperformed

02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:02.000
and we were all sitting here going are you high

02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:04.000
Tomb Raider was like the best

02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:06.000
that they've done in that series it's a very

02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:08.000
long time it's a little different you know because with

02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:10.000
like Splinter Cell that was the number four game

02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:12.000
of the month in uh you know

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:14.000
August they're Madden Saints World 4

02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:16.000
and Disney Infinity beating it out

02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:18.000
um I mean

02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:20.000
there's not a whole lot of other games

02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:22.000
besides those

02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:24.000
you know in the month

02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:26.000
uh versus Tomb Raider which is like

02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:28.000
one of the top selling games of the month

02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:30.000
I think it was like one or two

02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:32.000
you know cause Bioshock Infinite came out

02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:34.000
that same month so

02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:36.000
it's hard to tell I don't think

02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:38.000
it outsold Bioshock Infinite but it was

02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:40.000
definitely popular

02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:42.000
um so I could

02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:44.000
see the demand there for you know Tomb Raider

02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:46.000
and stuff but I'm not seeing a lot of like people

02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:48.000
saying oh I need copies of Splinter Cell because

02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:50.000
it sold out you know it's just Tomb Raider

02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:52.000
was like oh I need more Tomb Raider but

02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:54.000
I don't

02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:56.000
know we'll see maybe

02:08:56.000 --> 02:08:58.000
they still have Rainbow Six

02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:00.000
Patriots supposed to be coming

02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:02.000
out at some point you know and um

02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:04.000
I'm sure they'll

02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:06.000
do well in the fourth quarter Satsuns Creed

02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:08.000
is going to be a strong title for them and South Park

02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:10.000
looks awesome so

02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:12.000
they're not going to hurt too much oh

02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:14.000
and Just Dance I mean that's definitely going to help

02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:16.000
so they've got a pretty solid fourth

02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:18.000
quarter

02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:20.000
alright um moving on to

02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:22.000
a story about a game

02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:24.000
that is disappearing not because it underperformed

02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:26.000
but because of license issues

02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:28.000
Yoshi's Cookie I don't know if you

02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:30.000
guys remember this game it was a game that was on the NES

02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:32.000
it was actually what they don't

02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:34.000
say in a lot of these articles about this story is that it

02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:36.000
was also on the Super Nintendo because it's where I remember

02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:38.000
playing it was it was on the Super Nintendo

02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:40.000
but they released the Nintendo version of it

02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:42.000
for the Virtual Console some

02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:44.000
time ago Yoshi's Cookie

02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:46.000
it got delisted this week it's

02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:48.000
removed you will no longer be able to access it

02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:50.000
on the Virtual Console it was pulled on

02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:52.000
October 18th which bummer I

02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:54.000
should have got it but the Super Nintendo version was better anyway

02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:56.000
um

02:09:56.000 --> 02:09:58.000
here's the thing about the game Yoshi's Cookie wasn't developed

02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:00.000
by Nintendo it was developed by Bulletproof

02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:02.000
Software Bulletproof made the

02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:04.000
Tetris port for the Game Boy in 1989

02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:06.000
which was you know huge

02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:08.000
so that's why Nintendo you know trusted

02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:10.000
them with the Yoshi stuff but

02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:12.000
expired licenses being as

02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:14.000
they are the game is no longer available

02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:16.000
for sale

02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:18.000
this is not the first game to be delisted

02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:20.000
for similar reasons Konami's

02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:22.000
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles no longer available

02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:24.000
Irem did a version of R-Type that was on

02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:26.000
the Virtual Console no longer there the Donkey Kong

02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:28.000
Country trilogy also no

02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:30.000
longer there so

02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:32.000
if you didn't get this game I

02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:34.000
guess you'll have to go steal it from a ROM

02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:36.000
or go find it at

02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:38.000
Garage Sale good luck to you

02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:40.000
I guess I could lend it to somebody

02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:42.000
do you have the Super Nintendo version because I like the

02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:44.000
Super Nintendo version I don't believe I do actually

02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:46.000
I might have to check I mean at this

02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:48.000
point I don't know what I have

02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:50.000
after playing the Super Nintendo version the NES version

02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:52.000
felt kind of gimped you know

02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:54.000
as sometimes happens there were a few titles like

02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:56.000
that that were on both platforms

02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:58.000
but anyway

02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:00.000
it's not like it was that good of a puzzler

02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:02.000
it was just kind of fun it had a

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:04.000
good versus mode in it

02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:06.000
alright it is that time of the week

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:08.000

02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:26.000
DarkSakura mail

02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:28.000
well thanks

02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:30.000
Flaco Jones sent us an email

02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:32.000
that has a YouTube link in it

02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:34.000
oh that means I've

02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:36.000
got to pull up the mailbag too

02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:39.000
I'll just leave it to everybody to listen to

02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:41.000
um hey OLR since Mark Hamill has

02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:43.000
retired from doing the Joker voice I wanted to

02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:45.000
know what you thought of Troy Baker talking

02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:47.000
I'm sorry taking over the role for the new Batman

02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:49.000
Arkham game I had my doubts until

02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:51.000
I heard a sample reading from

02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:53.000
the killing joke that he gave

02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:55.000
during the Arkham Origins panel

02:11:55.000 --> 02:11:57.000
at New York Comic Con this guy is

02:11:57.000 --> 02:11:59.000
super talented for sure I linked the

02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:01.000
YouTube video if you have time to play it it's just

02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:03.000
over a minute long and starts 2

02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:05.000
minutes and 11 seconds in if

02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:07.000
the link doesn't jump there right away what

02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:09.000
do you all think? I've heard it's awesome

02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:11.000
uh actually I remember

02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:13.000
hearing about this but I didn't

02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:15.000
hear the actual voice so

02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:17.000
courtesy of Flaco Jones

02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:19.000
memories

02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:21.000
can be vile

02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:23.000
perfect

02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:25.000
repulsive little

02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:27.000
brutes like children

02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:29.000
I suppose

02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:31.000
but

02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:33.000
can we live without them

02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:35.000
memories are what our reason

02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:37.000
is based upon

02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:39.000
if we can't face them we

02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:41.000
deny reason itself

02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:43.000
okay he gets a pass

02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:45.000
that's good I like that

02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:47.000
I've heard him do something else

02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:49.000
and I'm trying to remember where I've heard that voice before

02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:51.000
4 for you Troy Baker you go Troy Baker oh god he's a

02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:53.000
hugely popular voice no I know but I'm trying

02:12:53.000 --> 02:12:55.000
to remember um what

02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:57.000
specifically I have recently

02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:01.000
um well he was in Bioshock Infinite

02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:03.000
which I haven't played

02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:05.000
either

02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:07.000
what would you have played that he

02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:09.000
was in I'm trying to think

02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:11.000
because he's done a ton of anime

02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:13.000
hold on which I don't

02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:15.000
really watch Fubbed Anime

02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:17.000
Snow he was Snow in 13

02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:19.000
Kid Icarus Uprising

02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:21.000
you mentioned you played uh he's in that

02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:23.000
um

02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:25.000
Metal Gear Solid he's

02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:27.000
Ocelot in 5

02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:29.000
okay so he was Hawkeye

02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:31.000
which I

02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:33.000
have watched because of Jennifer

02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:35.000
Hale oh and uh he's

02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:37.000
James in Silent Hill 2 oh but only in the HD

02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:39.000
version I think

02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:41.000
oh then yeah which I didn't play

02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:43.000
either oh well anyhow

02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:45.000
moving on yeah well

02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:47.000
oh no he was Robin

02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:49.000
in Arkham City and Two-Face

02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:51.000
so I knew he had been in another of

02:13:51.000 --> 02:13:53.000
the games before Game Guru

02:13:53.000 --> 02:13:55.000
in chat says wait that wasn't Mark Hamill

02:13:55.000 --> 02:13:57.000
nope nope that was that was Troy Baker

02:13:57.000 --> 02:13:59.000
good job yeah well I mean

02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:01.000
I'd have to say that's pretty good if you know you can actually

02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:03.000
get him confused with Mark Hamill

02:14:03.000 --> 02:14:05.000
so um anyway

02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:07.000
moving on um this

02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:09.000
comes from um

02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:11.000
Brian

02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:13.000
and I did see Shane

02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:15.000
say that he's sung with Akira Yamamoto's band

02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:17.000
um okay

02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:19.000
hi OLR I'm disappointed

02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:21.000
with current gen Star Trek games

02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:23.000
Star Trek Legacy was released on

02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:25.000
360 N06 it took the franchise

02:14:25.000 --> 02:14:27.000
seven more years to release a Star Trek game

02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:29.000
overall the franchise has released

02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:31.000
low quality games for current gen consoles

02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:33.000
do you see a future for Star Trek games in the

02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:35.000
next gen consoles thanks

02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:37.000
um well Brian I don't think so

02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:39.000
I mean

02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:41.000
if they do anything it's gonna definitely be like

02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:43.000
um a movie tie in I think

02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:45.000
well the last movie tie in was pretty

02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:47.000
terrible too that's the problem there's nothing

02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:49.000
to make the games really

02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:51.000
on right now unless

02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:53.000
you know they go back and

02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:55.000
do a new next generation game which would be

02:14:55.000 --> 02:14:57.000
awesome uh they do

02:14:57.000 --> 02:14:59.000
have the Star Trek next generation pinball table

02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:01.000
in pinball arcade just random tangent

02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:03.000
cause when I saw that I got giddy

02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:05.000
um I will say this though so one thing

02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:07.000
that email left out and I don't know if that's just because

02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:09.000
this person is very console focused but

02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:11.000
you neglected Star Trek online

02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:13.000
which I don't think I mean it's free to play

02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:15.000
it's worth a look I don't think it's bad

02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:17.000
especially if you're a Star Trek fan I think it's worth checking out

02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:19.000
and I have to say that they did actually retool

02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:21.000
um that the skill system

02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:23.000
that I kind of got pissed off when they changed it

02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:25.000
the first time it's a lot more

02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:27.000
manageable now um space battles

02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:29.000
are still kind of you know you have to

02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:31.000
ease into it from beginning to

02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:33.000
admiral for you to finally get and they

02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:35.000
got rid of rear admiral as a rank I'm just saying

02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:37.000
but um

02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:39.000
it was it was

02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:41.000
Star Trek online was really good

02:15:41.000 --> 02:15:43.000
I liked it I mean really all I did was ever

02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:45.000
play it hang out at deep space night and play

02:15:45.000 --> 02:15:47.000
Dabo Dabo with

02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:49.000
Lina so

02:15:49.000 --> 02:15:51.000
so there's that

02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:53.000
I mean but unfortunately the reality is

02:15:53.000 --> 02:15:55.000
without that stuff to tie into

02:15:55.000 --> 02:15:57.000
and the fact that the video games unfortunately

02:15:57.000 --> 02:15:59.000
have been tanking like it doesn't look

02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:01.000
good which pains me because

02:16:01.000 --> 02:16:03.000
I love me some Trek and I would love

02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:05.000
to see like a really good video game

02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:07.000
happen and it's kind of irritating that

02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:09.000
that last one was such a stinker

02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:11.000
actually going back to Star Trek online

02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:13.000
I do suggest if this person has not played

02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:15.000
it to do so because no matter which

02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:17.000
era of Star Trek you liked

02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:19.000
and yeah I really did not like Enterprise

02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:21.000
but there are enough nods to the

02:16:21.000 --> 02:16:23.000
even TOS characters show

02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:25.000
up like you actually do a time

02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:27.000
travel one and meet you know McCoy

02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:29.000
and actually the model looks pretty

02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:31.000
pretty much like he did

02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:33.000
so I mean it's really really

02:16:33.000 --> 02:16:35.000
fun I think

02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:37.000
if you like Star Trek it's got enough nods that I think

02:16:37.000 --> 02:16:39.000
it would keep you interested

02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:41.000
nice

02:16:41.000 --> 02:16:43.000
so um

02:16:43.000 --> 02:16:45.000
back to the email

02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:47.000
we have a kind of long one

02:16:47.000 --> 02:16:49.000
but not terribly long so I'll read it

02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:51.000
hello there OLR

02:16:51.000 --> 02:16:53.000
hi

02:16:53.000 --> 02:16:55.000
I always feel the need to say hi back I'm friendly

02:16:55.000 --> 02:16:57.000
yeah you're friendly you're so

02:16:57.000 --> 02:16:59.000
friendly um well last week

02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:01.000
I had a very very unfortunate thing happen

02:17:01.000 --> 02:17:03.000
to me when looking for alternative digital

02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:05.000
distribution network now you

02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:07.000
guys know I'm not big on DRM so I was really

02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:09.000
happy that gamersgate.com

02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:11.000
had a selection of DRM free titles

02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:13.000
I bought a couple only to find out that the games

02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:15.000
weren't all they seemed wait who is this

02:17:15.000 --> 02:17:17.000
because they say we have to make some assumptions

02:17:17.000 --> 02:17:19.000
about them in advance

02:17:19.000 --> 02:17:21.000
ah I see okay

02:17:21.000 --> 02:17:23.000
okay

02:17:23.000 --> 02:17:25.000
um instead of giving

02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:27.000
me a full installer I got very small files

02:17:27.000 --> 02:17:29.000
that pull temporary files from the internet for installation

02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:31.000
as I would find out after

02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:33.000
perusing the site you're not able to get full

02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:35.000
proper installers even if you keep the

02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:37.000
temp files you can't install your game

02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:39.000
without an internet connection needless to say

02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:41.000
I was angry I shot off an email

02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:43.000
to gamersgate asking for

02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:45.000
remedy for this issue only be told point

02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:47.000
blank there only called

02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:49.000
them DRM free because there were no serial

02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:51.000
numbers the person

02:17:51.000 --> 02:17:53.000
who emailed me back even had the gall to say

02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:55.000
that Steam and Origin weren't DRM

02:17:55.000 --> 02:17:57.000
and that theirs was an industry standard

02:17:57.000 --> 02:17:59.000
despite my never having seen something like

02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:01.000
this before for the record the Steam versions

02:18:01.000 --> 02:18:03.000
you do get the full games downloaded

02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:05.000
so that is a point um

02:18:05.000 --> 02:18:07.000
I demanded my money back but they

02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:09.000
refused to budge so now I'm left sending you

02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:11.000
an email and hoping to steer anyone else away

02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:13.000
from there you know you do have the better business bureau

02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:15.000
you can file an official complaint

02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:17.000
especially if you feel like what you got wasn't

02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:19.000
what was advertised I think you know you do

02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:21.000
have a legit basis for complaint there

02:18:21.000 --> 02:18:23.000
exactly especially since you

02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:25.000
messaged them first to remedy

02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:27.000
it cause you have to have taken that step

02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:29.000
and I'm gonna be real this

02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:31.000
is Orange Lounge Radio not

02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:33.000
you know a TV network or something I mean

02:18:33.000 --> 02:18:35.000
we're a small group

02:18:35.000 --> 02:18:37.000
here we love our audience we love the

02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:39.000
small following that we have but

02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:41.000
this wouldn't really make waves

02:18:41.000 --> 02:18:43.000
the way that I think you

02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:45.000
you really want this company to

02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:47.000
own up to what they're selling

02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:49.000
well just but I appreciate

02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:51.000
the heads up nonetheless seriously

02:18:51.000 --> 02:18:53.000
I don't care what your attitude is towards DRM

02:18:53.000 --> 02:18:55.000
it's unacceptable for a company to say that

02:18:55.000 --> 02:18:57.000
something is DRM free when it really isn't

02:18:57.000 --> 02:18:59.000
it's the most

02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:01.000
disgusting dishonest thing I have ever experienced

02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:03.000
and I wholeheartedly recommend people stay the hell away

02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:05.000
from gamersgate.com after all

02:19:05.000 --> 02:19:07.000
if they're lying about this what else are they lying about

02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:09.000
however this is not a tale

02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:11.000
of total loss I emailed Robert Boyd

02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:13.000
of Zeboid Games and told him what happened

02:19:13.000 --> 02:19:15.000
he immediately sent me

02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:17.000
a desperate copy of the game that I had

02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:19.000
bought and they were actually DRM free

02:19:19.000 --> 02:19:21.000
moral of the story avoid gamersgate

02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:23.000
and thumbs up to Zeboid

02:19:23.000 --> 02:19:25.000
still waiting on response from Valusoft though

02:19:25.000 --> 02:19:27.000
well that's my story hope I've steered a few people away from

02:19:27.000 --> 02:19:29.000
gamersgate if I've helped someone the money I lost

02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:31.000
was worth it sincerely we're all still UT

02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:33.000
kinda interesting way he went about

02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:35.000
the second half of that email where he says

02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:37.000
I emailed the people that made the game

02:19:37.000 --> 02:19:39.000
and said did you know this

02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:41.000
but what's interesting to me is that he kind of breezed

02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:43.000
by the fact that he got the Desura code

02:19:43.000 --> 02:19:45.000
so why not is Desura

02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:47.000
now your option of choice because

02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:49.000
I know a lot of people are using Desura as a Steam alternative

02:19:49.000 --> 02:19:51.000
and even I've used it because

02:19:51.000 --> 02:19:53.000
one of our listeners was kind enough to give me a game

02:19:53.000 --> 02:19:55.000
but it was on Desura so I've used it and it's fine

02:19:55.000 --> 02:19:57.000
so is that

02:19:57.000 --> 02:19:59.000
is Desura like your happy

02:19:59.000 --> 02:20:01.000
alternative now that you've found

02:20:01.000 --> 02:20:03.000
I don't know if I really heard that part of it

02:20:03.000 --> 02:20:05.000
but I will say this in the email

02:20:05.000 --> 02:20:07.000
in our chat room live.vognetware.com

02:20:07.000 --> 02:20:09.000
actdef says

02:20:09.000 --> 02:20:11.000
gamersgate is a mess of a site

02:20:11.000 --> 02:20:13.000
I try not to buy from them

02:20:13.000 --> 02:20:15.000
I've never heard of this site I have no opinion

02:20:15.000 --> 02:20:17.000
I can only go off what the listeners say

02:20:17.000 --> 02:20:19.000
and Rama says to file a

02:20:19.000 --> 02:20:21.000
chargeback on your credit card

02:20:21.000 --> 02:20:23.000
usually you want to do that as a last

02:20:23.000 --> 02:20:25.000
resort because that can come back to bite you

02:20:25.000 --> 02:20:27.000
I would say better business bureau first

02:20:27.000 --> 02:20:29.000
and I do believe if I've

02:20:29.000 --> 02:20:31.000
heard right if you've done a chargeback

02:20:31.000 --> 02:20:33.000
then the company themselves may actually file

02:20:33.000 --> 02:20:35.000
with a collection

02:20:35.000 --> 02:20:37.000
which shows up on your credit report

02:20:37.000 --> 02:20:39.000
you've got to be careful with that stuff

02:20:39.000 --> 02:20:41.000
but no I'd say

02:20:41.000 --> 02:20:43.000
you don't want to burn your chargebacks because obviously the bank

02:20:43.000 --> 02:20:45.000
is going to take issue if you keep doing it

02:20:45.000 --> 02:20:47.000
I wouldn't want to burn it on something like this

02:20:47.000 --> 02:20:49.000
like use a chargeback when you really want to

02:20:49.000 --> 02:20:51.000
fuck somebody over

02:20:51.000 --> 02:20:53.000
my suggestion is

02:20:53.000 --> 02:20:55.000
have copies of all of the emails you've sent

02:20:55.000 --> 02:20:57.000
plus the responses dated

02:20:57.000 --> 02:20:59.000
make sure they're date stamped

02:20:59.000 --> 02:21:01.000
and use those with your filing

02:21:01.000 --> 02:21:03.000
to the better business bureau you know I got a free hamburger doing that

02:21:03.000 --> 02:21:05.000
once

02:21:05.000 --> 02:21:07.000
I got a free meal

02:21:07.000 --> 02:21:09.000
from this place and they didn't give you fries the

02:21:09.000 --> 02:21:11.000
cheap bastards no no no I got a sweet potato

02:21:11.000 --> 02:21:13.000
fries I got a whole meal nice and

02:21:13.000 --> 02:21:15.000
they actually we actually

02:21:15.000 --> 02:21:17.000
got to see them make the meal

02:21:17.000 --> 02:21:19.000
a free voucher for a meal for two

02:21:19.000 --> 02:21:21.000
because I complained about

02:21:21.000 --> 02:21:23.000
the strata place that's on

02:21:23.000 --> 02:21:25.000
Watt Avenue I used to work

02:21:25.000 --> 02:21:27.000
next door to them so oh I don't even know

02:21:27.000 --> 02:21:29.000
it's attached to like a Days Inn or something

02:21:29.000 --> 02:21:31.000
but oh but it's a nice

02:21:31.000 --> 02:21:33.000
restaurant attached to a crappy hotel

02:21:33.000 --> 02:21:35.000
but anyway yeah I

02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:37.000
can say for a fact that I've actually gotten something

02:21:37.000 --> 02:21:39.000
out of filing better business bureau complaints so

02:21:39.000 --> 02:21:41.000
and it was a pretty damn good hamburger too

02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:43.000
that

02:21:43.000 --> 02:21:45.000
is a tasty burger maybe

02:21:45.000 --> 02:21:47.000
Gamers Gate will send you a hamburger

02:21:47.000 --> 02:21:49.000
well we'll

02:21:49.000 --> 02:21:51.000
cross our fingers and our toes

02:21:51.000 --> 02:21:53.000
and then share with us okay

02:21:53.000 --> 02:21:55.000
last email

02:21:55.000 --> 02:21:57.000
okay hi OLR it's

02:21:57.000 --> 02:21:59.000
Reginator again

02:21:59.000 --> 02:22:01.000
I just had a question about computer

02:22:01.000 --> 02:22:03.000
OS's currently I'm on my laptop

02:22:03.000 --> 02:22:05.000
I have no currently on my laptop

02:22:05.000 --> 02:22:07.000
I have Windows 7 home premium installed

02:22:07.000 --> 02:22:09.000
which overall I'm happy with now the

02:22:09.000 --> 02:22:11.000
trouble is I am a supporter of Zune

02:22:11.000 --> 02:22:13.000
Xbox video in order for me to continue

02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:15.000
buying content for it either I

02:22:15.000 --> 02:22:17.000
have to replace my 360 that I sold

02:22:17.000 --> 02:22:19.000
off two years ago or upgrade to

02:22:19.000 --> 02:22:21.000
Windows 8 now the question is

02:22:21.000 --> 02:22:23.000
is it possible to finagle things so I can keep

02:22:23.000 --> 02:22:25.000
Windows 7 and use Windows 8

02:22:25.000 --> 02:22:27.000
I don't know like put Windows 8 on a USB

02:22:27.000 --> 02:22:29.000
drive or something how would I do

02:22:29.000 --> 02:22:31.000
that I never once did anything on a

02:22:31.000 --> 02:22:33.000
computer regarding an OS and I hate to either

02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:35.000
brick my PC lose Windows 7 etc.

02:22:35.000 --> 02:22:37.000
thanks in advance

02:22:37.000 --> 02:22:39.000
I will tell you this that Windows OS

02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:41.000
in both cases are very

02:22:41.000 --> 02:22:43.000
well

02:22:43.000 --> 02:22:45.000
extraneous with the other stuff that they

02:22:45.000 --> 02:22:47.000
install with it so you'd probably

02:22:47.000 --> 02:22:49.000
depending on how big your hard drive is you could

02:22:49.000 --> 02:22:51.000
probably partition

02:22:51.000 --> 02:22:53.000
yeah that's probably going to have to be the way you do it

02:22:53.000 --> 02:22:55.000
because you can dual boot your system

02:22:55.000 --> 02:22:57.000
but I don't know why you'd really

02:22:57.000 --> 02:22:59.000
want to do that if you want to go to Windows 8 then just go

02:22:59.000 --> 02:23:01.000
to Windows 8 you know if you need to see

02:23:01.000 --> 02:23:03.000
the new movies which I think is kind of a dick move

02:23:03.000 --> 02:23:05.000
on Microsoft's part I don't want to go to Windows

02:23:05.000 --> 02:23:07.000
8 but I know that when I rebuild my computer

02:23:07.000 --> 02:23:09.000
I'm basically going to put Windows 7 on it no matter

02:23:09.000 --> 02:23:11.000
what it comes with

02:23:11.000 --> 02:23:13.000
well don't forget 8.1 is out now

02:23:13.000 --> 02:23:15.000
I haven't used that myself

02:23:15.000 --> 02:23:17.000
there's stuff that make it like a lot more usable

02:23:17.000 --> 02:23:19.000
like you know so it's more like 7

02:23:19.000 --> 02:23:21.000
and Windows 8 overall is

02:23:21.000 --> 02:23:23.000
more stable than Windows 7

02:23:23.000 --> 02:23:25.000
it's just all the crap that they throw in the

02:23:25.000 --> 02:23:27.000
front there that you have to dig through

02:23:27.000 --> 02:23:29.000
and stuff's kind of moved around

02:23:29.000 --> 02:23:31.000
see at this point I'm ready just to go back to

02:23:31.000 --> 02:23:33.000
Linux Mint and Runwine for

02:23:33.000 --> 02:23:35.000
my other programs

02:23:35.000 --> 02:23:37.000
I mean they've now got most

02:23:37.000 --> 02:23:39.000
of the game drivers and everything

02:23:39.000 --> 02:23:41.000
compatible with Linux

02:23:41.000 --> 02:23:43.000
comments from our chat room at live.vognetware.com

02:23:43.000 --> 02:23:45.000
Rama says you don't need to upgrade to 8

02:23:45.000 --> 02:23:47.000
SG100Matt says dual boot if you want

02:23:47.000 --> 02:23:49.000
but there's no need for 8

02:23:49.000 --> 02:23:51.000
Brad from Pod Culture says just go to 8

02:23:51.000 --> 02:23:53.000
it runs everything from 7 just fine

02:23:53.000 --> 02:23:55.000
and then Bobby Blackwolf says this is a

02:23:55.000 --> 02:23:57.000
tech support question not a podcast email

02:23:57.000 --> 02:23:59.000
question well I'm wondering because

02:23:59.000 --> 02:24:01.000
he said the USB boot thing I'm wondering if he didn't

02:24:01.000 --> 02:24:03.000
think of that because we were talking about it with

02:24:03.000 --> 02:24:05.000
Linux a couple weeks ago

02:24:05.000 --> 02:24:07.000
I don't know though that Windows 8 will

02:24:07.000 --> 02:24:09.000
live boot you can't do a Windows boot like that

02:24:09.000 --> 02:24:11.000
I'm pretty sure yeah

02:24:11.000 --> 02:24:13.000
although I have done a

02:24:13.000 --> 02:24:15.000
USB installer for

02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:17.000
Windows for

02:24:17.000 --> 02:24:19.000
fuck what that was

02:24:19.000 --> 02:24:21.000
a netbook

02:24:21.000 --> 02:24:23.000
I have made an installer

02:24:23.000 --> 02:24:25.000
so I don't know

02:24:25.000 --> 02:24:27.000
is that it for emails? yeah that's it

02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:29.000
alright give Dark Soccer more work next week

02:24:29.000 --> 02:24:31.000

02:24:43.000 --> 02:24:45.000
let's get to the FUs of the week

02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:47.000
FU to emails

02:24:47.000 --> 02:24:49.000
no

02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:05.000
here's the part of the show where we get angsty why?

02:25:05.000 --> 02:25:07.000
because we can't

02:25:07.000 --> 02:25:09.000
um FU to all the people who are

02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:11.000
driving 10 miles under the speed limit and I mean

02:25:11.000 --> 02:25:13.000
it was like five fucking people driving 30

02:25:13.000 --> 02:25:15.000
in a 40 and I was like

02:25:15.000 --> 02:25:17.000
really people don't you know what a speed

02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:19.000
limit is and how to you know use it

02:25:19.000 --> 02:25:21.000
flow of traffic hello

02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:23.000
and the um

02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:25.000
wasp sting that I got

02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:27.000
that still hasn't healed look at this

02:25:27.000 --> 02:25:29.000
it's still there

02:25:29.000 --> 02:25:31.000
and also not having a job

02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:33.000
if somebody is listening to the show and you love

02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:35.000
the sound of my voice just keep in mind that I can

02:25:35.000 --> 02:25:37.000
also transfer the

02:25:37.000 --> 02:25:39.000
sexyness to web design

02:25:39.000 --> 02:25:41.000
and print design and fantastic customer service

02:25:41.000 --> 02:25:43.000
and amazing customer service I love

02:25:43.000 --> 02:25:45.000
talking to pissed off people

02:25:45.000 --> 02:25:47.000
it's what you know how do you de-escalate a customer

02:25:47.000 --> 02:25:49.000
de-escalate a customer well if they're yelling

02:25:49.000 --> 02:25:51.000
and cursing at me I give them a time out

02:25:51.000 --> 02:25:53.000
it works seriously we weren't allowed to

02:25:53.000 --> 02:25:55.000
hang up on people right so

02:25:55.000 --> 02:25:57.000
if it was all I want my pay off

02:25:57.000 --> 02:25:59.000
I'd be like

02:25:59.000 --> 02:26:01.000
now I'm sorry we need to have this

02:26:01.000 --> 02:26:03.000
conversation like civil adults so

02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:05.000
I'm going to put you on hold for two minutes

02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:07.000
let you calm down a little bit

02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:09.000
so we can come back and discuss this like adults

02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:11.000
bing!

02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:13.000
you know what they'd either hang up on me or they would come back and be nice

02:26:17.000 --> 02:26:19.000
that'll get you a job alright

02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:21.000
you know what it works

02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:23.000
and they can't and the thing is they can't

02:26:23.000 --> 02:26:25.000
complain about it because I did nothing

02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:27.000
uncivil

02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:29.000
she's got great attendance she's shown up to

02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:31.000
most of these shows

02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:33.000
unless I was like dead sick

02:26:33.000 --> 02:26:35.000
I even came here sick a few times

02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:37.000
alright Loki

02:26:37.000 --> 02:26:39.000
F you to Wingstop because

02:26:39.000 --> 02:26:41.000
why does it take 30 minutes for you to

02:26:41.000 --> 02:26:43.000
make wings for us

02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:45.000
I mean 30 minutes

02:26:45.000 --> 02:26:47.000
seriously you fry the wings

02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:49.000
you dip them in sauce

02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:51.000
done! Wingstop is fucking good though

02:26:51.000 --> 02:26:53.000
they're not that great that's not an endorsement

02:26:53.000 --> 02:26:55.000
if I want to eat like if I want food

02:26:55.000 --> 02:26:57.000
that will make me fat that's what I want

02:26:57.000 --> 02:26:59.000
because if I can go to KFC and get the wings

02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:01.000
dipped in sauce

02:27:01.000 --> 02:27:03.000
within the time that I order

02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:05.000
in the drive through and pull up to the window

02:27:05.000 --> 02:27:07.000
it should not take 30 fucking minutes

02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:09.000
to cook wings

02:27:09.000 --> 02:27:11.000
I'm sorry I mean it's like

02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:13.000
you don't fry wings for 30 minutes

02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:15.000
oh

02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:17.000
and their fries fucking suck they're

02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:19.000
soggy stale

02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:21.000
unsalted it was just like some

02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:23.000
of a crap potato into

02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:25.000
a little

02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:27.000
cardboard tray and try to pass it off

02:27:27.000 --> 02:27:29.000
as french fries it was just not

02:27:29.000 --> 02:27:33.000
good

02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:35.000
here we go the food show again

02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:37.000
orange lounge foodie

02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:39.000
Nelly wanted to try Wingstop even though

02:27:39.000 --> 02:27:41.000
I've been there and said listen it sucks

02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:43.000
you know we shouldn't go back

02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:45.000
take her to Hooters next time although I did get to try

02:27:45.000 --> 02:27:47.000
for the first time actually going inside and doing one of those

02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:49.000
coke freestyle machines and that was pretty

02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:51.000
those are pretty awesome

02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:53.000
she says we should go in these for our home I'm like

02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:55.000
yes we should

02:27:55.000 --> 02:27:57.000
that's a project you should work on building your own

02:27:57.000 --> 02:27:59.000
oh yeah that'd be expensive

02:27:59.000 --> 02:28:01.000
you could dispense the taurani syrup

02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:03.000
think about it

02:28:03.000 --> 02:28:05.000
I'm gonna give an FU to iMessage

02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:07.000
because we all know

02:28:07.000 --> 02:28:09.000
they're already having some type of bug

02:28:09.000 --> 02:28:11.000
and I've been trying to text message during the show

02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:13.000
and I think iMessage just stopped working

02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:15.000
and I don't know what the hell is going on

02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:17.000
but then one of my other friends sent me a text and I got it fine

02:28:17.000 --> 02:28:19.000
so I'm afraid I can't let you

02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:21.000
iMessage is my FU of the week

02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:23.000
and yes I'm an

02:28:23.000 --> 02:28:25.000
apple sheep and I have an iPhone

02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:27.000
I just want to text message people okay

02:28:27.000 --> 02:28:29.000
you can't text message breakup

02:28:29.000 --> 02:28:31.000
during the show? what?

02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:33.000
did you just

02:28:33.000 --> 02:28:35.000
quote a Kelly song over there? I did

02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:37.000
alright

02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:39.000
just a couple more stories and then Twitter topics

02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:41.000
and the Skype line at 1877

02:28:41.000 --> 02:28:43.000
game OLR

02:28:43.000 --> 02:28:45.000
first Loki

02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:47.000
alright so there's a new

02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:49.000
Kickstarter for a new

02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:51.000
augmented reality glass

02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:53.000
thing it's done by some

02:28:53.000 --> 02:28:55.000
ex-Valve employees

02:28:55.000 --> 02:28:57.000
I guess they've reached

02:28:57.000 --> 02:28:59.000
their goal already but they're doing their stretch goals

02:28:59.000 --> 02:29:01.000
what's kind of unique about it is

02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:03.000
it's these shutter glasses

02:29:03.000 --> 02:29:05.000
and they actually have projectors

02:29:05.000 --> 02:29:07.000
so it projects 3D

02:29:07.000 --> 02:29:09.000
images onto

02:29:09.000 --> 02:29:11.000
the environment

02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:13.000
the other thing though that seemed kind of weird though

02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:15.000
is like

02:29:15.000 --> 02:29:17.000
in the video and stuff

02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:19.000
it just didn't seem like

02:29:19.000 --> 02:29:21.000
I mean if you're moving your head and stuff

02:29:21.000 --> 02:29:23.000
the projection kind of change where it's at

02:29:23.000 --> 02:29:25.000
unless it's updating really fast

02:29:25.000 --> 02:29:27.000
I don't know

02:29:27.000 --> 02:29:29.000
I don't know, interesting, don't know what the price point though

02:29:29.000 --> 02:29:31.000
of it is

02:29:31.000 --> 02:29:33.000
certainly I'm not going to back it because

02:29:33.000 --> 02:29:35.000
I don't need to spend money on this kind of crap

02:29:35.000 --> 02:29:37.000
but you kind of want to

02:29:37.000 --> 02:29:39.000
no because it's not expected

02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:41.000
to come out for like a year

02:29:41.000 --> 02:29:43.000
you know a starter package is

02:29:43.000 --> 02:29:45.000
$189

02:29:45.000 --> 02:29:47.000
and you get a cast AR

02:29:47.000 --> 02:29:49.000
oh that's the weird thing about it is you have to have this like

02:29:49.000 --> 02:29:51.000
actually cast onto it's like a

02:29:51.000 --> 02:29:53.000
looks like a fabric

02:29:53.000 --> 02:29:55.000
thing almost like a green screen but it's

02:29:55.000 --> 02:29:57.000
grey so

02:29:57.000 --> 02:29:59.000
it seems like a lot of

02:29:59.000 --> 02:30:01.000
hassle but hey

02:30:01.000 --> 02:30:03.000
maybe if it's cheaper then

02:30:03.000 --> 02:30:05.000
I don't know

02:30:05.000 --> 02:30:07.000
the Oculus Rift it might be

02:30:07.000 --> 02:30:09.000
I think the Rift sounds more interesting because

02:30:09.000 --> 02:30:11.000
it's VR whereas this is augmented reality

02:30:11.000 --> 02:30:13.000
stuff and just I don't really

02:30:13.000 --> 02:30:15.000
care about AR stuff I remember

02:30:15.000 --> 02:30:17.000
trying to pull that shit off with the Vita and

02:30:17.000 --> 02:30:19.000
it sucked remember the Vita what they

02:30:19.000 --> 02:30:21.000
are you know stuff it's like oh

02:30:21.000 --> 02:30:23.000
let me try this soccer game

02:30:23.000 --> 02:30:25.000
wow that's that's shit okay cool

02:30:25.000 --> 02:30:27.000
alright

02:30:27.000 --> 02:30:29.000
one more story for you guys I swear it's like

02:30:29.000 --> 02:30:31.000
it's like Blast from OLR's past

02:30:31.000 --> 02:30:33.000
tonight and I guess Jason kind of referenced that

02:30:33.000 --> 02:30:35.000
in the intro tonight it's kind of true

02:30:35.000 --> 02:30:37.000
because we have one more story here tonight and it's about

02:30:37.000 --> 02:30:39.000
one of our favorite

02:30:39.000 --> 02:30:41.000
DDR knockoffs they ever had

02:30:41.000 --> 02:30:43.000
it was a game called Dance Dance

02:30:43.000 --> 02:30:45.000
Immolation and if you didn't know about

02:30:45.000 --> 02:30:47.000
this game this was the DDR

02:30:47.000 --> 02:30:49.000
game where if you made a misstep it would

02:30:49.000 --> 02:30:51.000
literally set you on fire

02:30:51.000 --> 02:30:53.000
and you're probably wondering how in the hell is this legal

02:30:53.000 --> 02:30:55.000
well A you had

02:30:55.000 --> 02:30:57.000
to wear this hugely flame

02:30:57.000 --> 02:30:59.000
retardant suit and all this stuff to even

02:30:59.000 --> 02:31:01.000
play the game and I'm sure you had to sign waiver after

02:31:01.000 --> 02:31:03.000
waiver and B it was

02:31:03.000 --> 02:31:05.000
the kind of thing that they would just take to Burning Man

02:31:05.000 --> 02:31:07.000
and like that type of like artsy

02:31:07.000 --> 02:31:09.000
stuff that's what you expect to see at Burning Man like that weird

02:31:09.000 --> 02:31:11.000
stuff also

02:31:11.000 --> 02:31:13.000
there were some other festivals Dance Dance Immolation went

02:31:13.000 --> 02:31:15.000
to including the fine arts festival

02:31:15.000 --> 02:31:17.000
a Denmark

02:31:17.000 --> 02:31:19.000
thing called Smuck Fest

02:31:19.000 --> 02:31:21.000
DDR for hipsters

02:31:21.000 --> 02:31:23.000
but anyway

02:31:23.000 --> 02:31:25.000
the game was officially retired

02:31:25.000 --> 02:31:27.000
at Burning Man 2013

02:31:27.000 --> 02:31:29.000
and then the display was

02:31:29.000 --> 02:31:31.000
ripped apart and then in

02:31:31.000 --> 02:31:33.000
true Burning Man what the fuck are they even doing

02:31:33.000 --> 02:31:35.000
anymore fashion and look I have friends that

02:31:35.000 --> 02:31:37.000
go to Burning Man and love it and swear by it and

02:31:37.000 --> 02:31:39.000
I'm not knocking it but I'm just saying

02:31:39.000 --> 02:31:41.000
the randomness

02:31:41.000 --> 02:31:43.000
of some of this shit doesn't help the

02:31:43.000 --> 02:31:45.000
theories that everybody's on drugs there

02:31:45.000 --> 02:31:47.000
I'm just saying

02:31:47.000 --> 02:31:49.000
I'm just saying

02:31:49.000 --> 02:31:51.000
I'm just saying but anyhow

02:31:51.000 --> 02:31:53.000
the way they destroyed it

02:31:53.000 --> 02:31:55.000
what I meant to say is that

02:31:55.000 --> 02:31:57.000
they dropped a piano on it

02:31:57.000 --> 02:31:59.000
actually they dropped

02:31:59.000 --> 02:32:01.000
a piano on what was left and since I know

02:32:01.000 --> 02:32:03.000
Dark Soccer is dying to see

02:32:03.000 --> 02:32:05.000
here it is

02:32:05.000 --> 02:32:07.000
they dropped

02:32:07.000 --> 02:32:09.000
an old

02:32:09.000 --> 02:32:11.000
powder blue upright

02:32:11.000 --> 02:32:13.000
and then

02:32:13.000 --> 02:32:15.000
all the people I need to go to

02:32:15.000 --> 02:32:17.000
Burning Man Rob it's just so fucking hard

02:32:17.000 --> 02:32:19.000
no no

02:32:19.000 --> 02:32:21.000
but

02:32:21.000 --> 02:32:23.000
I love you

02:32:23.000 --> 02:32:25.000
if you want to take drugs and run naked through the desert

02:32:25.000 --> 02:32:27.000
I guess you can do that I love you

02:32:27.000 --> 02:32:29.000
but sometimes

02:32:29.000 --> 02:32:31.000
little things make you pretty

02:32:31.000 --> 02:32:33.000
irritable and going to

02:32:33.000 --> 02:32:35.000
the desert

02:32:35.000 --> 02:32:37.000
for seven days

02:32:37.000 --> 02:32:39.000
I'd probably want to murder everybody

02:32:39.000 --> 02:32:41.000
I don't know where these people

02:32:41.000 --> 02:32:43.000
poop

02:32:43.000 --> 02:32:45.000
they have an RV

02:32:45.000 --> 02:32:47.000
I guess it's RVs or whatever

02:32:47.000 --> 02:32:49.000
there's no such thing as money

02:32:49.000 --> 02:32:51.000
it's a barter system

02:32:51.000 --> 02:32:53.000
Dark Soccer

02:32:53.000 --> 02:32:55.000
I don't think you'd enjoy it

02:32:55.000 --> 02:32:57.000
I think you'd complain a little bit

02:32:57.000 --> 02:32:59.000
I probably wouldn't

02:32:59.000 --> 02:33:01.000
every so often I want to go see

02:33:01.000 --> 02:33:03.000
some of this stuff in person

02:33:03.000 --> 02:33:05.000
and then you just reminded me

02:33:05.000 --> 02:33:07.000
no air conditioning

02:33:07.000 --> 02:33:09.000
fuck that shit I can't stand hot

02:33:09.000 --> 02:33:11.000
and I live in Sacramento

02:33:11.000 --> 02:33:13.000
what am I thinking

02:33:13.000 --> 02:33:15.000
well you're on drugs

02:33:15.000 --> 02:33:17.000
I'm on the drugs that keep me from murdering people

02:33:17.000 --> 02:33:19.000
I just want to make it clear

02:33:19.000 --> 02:33:21.000
I'm just teasing

02:33:21.000 --> 02:33:23.000
I don't want to offend the people because I have friends that go to this

02:33:23.000 --> 02:33:25.000
and they have a great time and they always tell me I should go

02:33:25.000 --> 02:33:27.000
but I'm like my

02:33:27.000 --> 02:33:29.000
red headed ass cannot

02:33:29.000 --> 02:33:31.000
handle seven days

02:33:31.000 --> 02:33:33.000
in the desert

02:33:33.000 --> 02:33:35.000
it's not going to happen

02:33:35.000 --> 02:33:37.000
I will watch the YouTubes

02:33:37.000 --> 02:33:39.000
what if you went through the desert on a horse with no name

02:33:41.000 --> 02:33:43.000
I don't even want to do this show anymore

02:33:43.000 --> 02:33:45.000
alright

02:33:45.000 --> 02:33:47.000
I'm just kidding

02:33:47.000 --> 02:33:49.000
I do want to talk to you on Skype

02:33:49.000 --> 02:33:51.000
maybe you'll have a better topic to talk about

02:33:51.000 --> 02:33:53.000
1-877-GAME-OLR

02:33:53.000 --> 02:33:55.000
talk about Rob's red headed ass

02:33:55.000 --> 02:33:57.000
stop being weird

02:33:57.000 --> 02:33:59.000
our username on Skype

02:33:59.000 --> 02:34:01.000
Orange Lounge Radio

02:34:01.000 --> 02:34:03.000
all one word if you want to give us a call

02:34:03.000 --> 02:34:05.000
Bobby Black Wolf is in our chat room

02:34:05.000 --> 02:34:07.000
saying I go to Dragon Con

02:34:07.000 --> 02:34:09.000
instead of Burning Man

02:34:09.000 --> 02:34:11.000
they're at the same time

02:34:11.000 --> 02:34:13.000
and you know what

02:34:13.000 --> 02:34:15.000
that's my new drug of choice too

02:34:15.000 --> 02:34:17.000
I did really love Dragon Con this year

02:34:17.000 --> 02:34:19.000
I can't wait to go back

02:34:19.000 --> 02:34:21.000
I can poke fun at myself too

02:34:21.000 --> 02:34:23.000
because I said everyone's on drugs at Burning Man

02:34:23.000 --> 02:34:25.000
well at Dragon Con everybody's drunk

02:34:25.000 --> 02:34:27.000
and I say that as a proud Dragon Con attendee

02:34:27.000 --> 02:34:29.000
responsibly

02:34:29.000 --> 02:34:31.000
we're responsibly drunk

02:34:31.000 --> 02:34:33.000
but I'm just saying

02:34:33.000 --> 02:34:35.000
Rob, next year, Fauna Mae

02:34:35.000 --> 02:34:37.000
I really do want to go back to Fauna Mae

02:34:37.000 --> 02:34:39.000
you should cosplay Black Mage

02:34:39.000 --> 02:34:41.000
and I should cosplay White Mage

02:34:41.000 --> 02:34:43.000
which kind of Black Mage

02:34:43.000 --> 02:34:45.000
Classic Black Mage or Final Fantasy XIV

02:34:45.000 --> 02:34:47.000
maybe XIV

02:34:47.000 --> 02:34:49.000
Gamer X2

02:34:49.000 --> 02:34:51.000
Dark Sakura, I've got to take you to Gamer X2

02:34:51.000 --> 02:34:53.000
because I know

02:34:53.000 --> 02:34:55.000
that all my gay gaming

02:34:55.000 --> 02:34:57.000
podcast guys

02:34:57.000 --> 02:34:59.000
want to meet you

02:34:59.000 --> 02:35:01.000
they listen to this show

02:35:01.000 --> 02:35:03.000
they love you

02:35:03.000 --> 02:35:05.000
they like Loki too

02:35:05.000 --> 02:35:07.000
you are the one that tried to make Lolo gay

02:35:07.000 --> 02:35:09.000
let's be real

02:35:09.000 --> 02:35:11.000
look, I can't help it if Lala

02:35:11.000 --> 02:35:13.000
is really a cross dresser

02:35:13.000 --> 02:35:15.000
no I'm kidding

02:35:15.000 --> 02:35:17.000
I don't know if you are listening to these shows

02:35:17.000 --> 02:35:19.000
I don't shout them out enough here on the program

02:35:19.000 --> 02:35:21.000
unfortunately we don't really have a shout out segment

02:35:21.000 --> 02:35:23.000
but I do want to give a shout out to folks

02:35:23.000 --> 02:35:25.000
like Game Buoy, you know them

02:35:25.000 --> 02:35:27.000
very well, right?

02:35:27.000 --> 02:35:29.000
Koopa Club, I don't know if you're listening to them

02:35:29.000 --> 02:35:31.000
but they're a lot of fun, they're out of Chicago

02:35:31.000 --> 02:35:33.000
you would love them

02:35:33.000 --> 02:35:35.000
Video Game Realness, Canadian, hilarious

02:35:35.000 --> 02:35:37.000
they kind of do what we do here

02:35:37.000 --> 02:35:39.000
where they're all at one table in one room

02:35:39.000 --> 02:35:41.000
and they should send us some poutine

02:35:43.000 --> 02:35:45.000
he was bitching about soggy fries

02:35:45.000 --> 02:35:47.000
from Wingstop earlier

02:35:47.000 --> 02:35:49.000
I do not want FedExed poutine

02:35:49.000 --> 02:35:51.000
there's actually a place in town you can get poutine

02:35:51.000 --> 02:35:53.000
alright, Game Bar

02:35:53.000 --> 02:35:55.000
is another one

02:35:55.000 --> 02:35:57.000
no, it's an actual restaurant

02:35:57.000 --> 02:35:59.000
not a strip club

02:35:59.000 --> 02:36:01.000
no, Poon-teen

02:36:01.000 --> 02:36:03.000
I'm sorry

02:36:03.000 --> 02:36:05.000
you're thinking of Poon-teen

02:36:07.000 --> 02:36:09.000
shut up

02:36:09.000 --> 02:36:11.000
we did already have Kirby

02:36:11.000 --> 02:36:13.000
birth 1877

02:36:13.000 --> 02:36:15.000
Game O.L.R. or a username on Skype

02:36:15.000 --> 02:36:17.000
Orange Lounge Radio, you need to call us

02:36:17.000 --> 02:36:19.000
or it's going to be the Poutine Hour

02:36:19.000 --> 02:36:21.000
and Loki may not

02:36:21.000 --> 02:36:23.000
give you what you think that is

02:36:23.000 --> 02:36:25.000
with the Poutine Hour

02:36:25.000 --> 02:36:29.000
or we could go to Last Minute Stories

02:36:29.000 --> 02:36:31.000
while we wait for some calls

02:36:31.000 --> 02:36:33.000
sure, why not

02:36:33.000 --> 02:36:35.000
let's talk about Grand Theft Auto 5

02:36:35.000 --> 02:36:37.000
it's number 2 in Japan

02:36:37.000 --> 02:36:39.000
after debuting

02:36:39.000 --> 02:36:41.000
what was number 1 though, I'm kind of curious

02:36:41.000 --> 02:36:43.000
oh, Pokemon

02:36:43.000 --> 02:36:45.000
anyway, number 2 is not bad

02:36:45.000 --> 02:36:47.000
they're corrupt, y'all

02:36:47.000 --> 02:36:49.000
they are, they're going to have to do something about it

02:36:53.000 --> 02:36:55.000
yeah, that's it

02:36:55.000 --> 02:36:57.000
that's all I got

02:36:57.000 --> 02:36:59.000
there were some stories on

02:36:59.000 --> 02:37:01.000
the Xbox One also is not going to support

02:37:01.000 --> 02:37:03.000
third party headsets at launch

02:37:03.000 --> 02:37:05.000
not until 2014

02:37:05.000 --> 02:37:07.000
there were some

02:37:07.000 --> 02:37:09.000
stories on Zelda this week

02:37:09.000 --> 02:37:11.000
that we didn't get to, and I don't remember what they were

02:37:11.000 --> 02:37:13.000
does it involve Poutine?

02:37:13.000 --> 02:37:15.000
yes

02:37:15.000 --> 02:37:17.000
yes, because Poutine is

02:37:17.000 --> 02:37:19.000
the national food of Hyrule

02:37:19.000 --> 02:37:21.000
if you do the dungeons in a certain order

02:37:21.000 --> 02:37:23.000
you can actually collect the gravy and the

02:37:23.000 --> 02:37:25.000
cheese curd power up

02:37:25.000 --> 02:37:27.000
and go to town

02:37:27.000 --> 02:37:29.000
we have pianos

02:37:29.000 --> 02:37:31.000
dropping on DDR machines that set people on fire

02:37:31.000 --> 02:37:33.000
what

02:37:33.000 --> 02:37:35.000
what, I just haven't done that in a while

02:37:37.000 --> 02:37:39.000
I thought you were cutting sugar out

02:37:39.000 --> 02:37:41.000
of your diet, yet you sound like

02:37:41.000 --> 02:37:43.000
like a four year old that

02:37:43.000 --> 02:37:45.000
just ate a Snickers bar

02:37:45.000 --> 02:37:47.000
because I now have quite stable blood sugar and I'm hyper all the time

02:37:47.000 --> 02:37:49.000
alright, fair enough

02:37:49.000 --> 02:37:51.000
alright, yes, thank you actdeft, I'm going to Twitter topics

02:37:51.000 --> 02:37:53.000
I'm trying, I'm doing Twitter topics

02:37:53.000 --> 02:37:55.000
I want someone to call us

02:37:55.000 --> 02:37:57.000
who hasn't called before

02:37:57.000 --> 02:37:59.000
because I'm running out of things to say Poutine

02:37:59.000 --> 02:38:01.000
about

02:38:01.000 --> 02:38:03.000
that is actually

02:38:03.000 --> 02:38:05.000
true, ssh100map

02:38:05.000 --> 02:38:07.000
you misspelled

02:38:07.000 --> 02:38:09.000
p-o-u-t-i-n-e, Poutine

02:38:09.000 --> 02:38:11.000
and dongles

02:38:11.000 --> 02:38:13.000
those are like two, you know another word that makes me

02:38:13.000 --> 02:38:15.000
giggle like that, balls

02:38:17.000 --> 02:38:19.000
I'm turning dark side with my stuff

02:38:19.000 --> 02:38:21.000
oh thank god, we're getting a call

02:38:21.000 --> 02:38:23.000
thank the lord

02:38:23.000 --> 02:38:25.000
somebody's going to help us talk about something

02:38:25.000 --> 02:38:27.000
maybe Canadian, maybe not, I don't know

02:38:27.000 --> 02:38:29.000
hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio, who's this?

02:38:29.000 --> 02:38:31.000
hey, this is Zappi, and I officially endorse Poutine

02:38:31.000 --> 02:38:33.000
what's that?

02:38:33.000 --> 02:38:35.000
I officially endorse Poutine

02:38:35.000 --> 02:38:37.000
are you Canadian?

02:38:37.000 --> 02:38:39.000
I'm from French Canada, so it's really

02:38:39.000 --> 02:38:41.000
I love Poutine so much

02:38:41.000 --> 02:38:43.000
god dammit

02:38:43.000 --> 02:38:45.000
and I haven't had it since Louisiana

02:38:45.000 --> 02:38:47.000
alright Zappi, have a great night

02:38:47.000 --> 02:38:49.000
no, I'm just kidding

02:38:49.000 --> 02:38:51.000
what did you call in to talk to us about tonight, Zappi?

02:38:51.000 --> 02:38:53.000
well, besides Poutine, I was

02:38:53.000 --> 02:38:55.000
going to talk about me playing the Xbox One

02:38:55.000 --> 02:38:57.000
this week

02:38:57.000 --> 02:38:59.000
why, how'd that happen?

02:38:59.000 --> 02:39:01.000
well, I just went to my local Best Buy

02:39:01.000 --> 02:39:03.000
and lo and behold, they just had an Xbox One demo out

02:39:03.000 --> 02:39:05.000
I went into my local

02:39:05.000 --> 02:39:07.000
Best Buy, and like, I had to ask

02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:09.000
to get a copy of Pokemon, why

02:39:09.000 --> 02:39:11.000
like, may I buy a copy of Pokemon

02:39:11.000 --> 02:39:13.000
because I don't see it on the shelf

02:39:13.000 --> 02:39:15.000
I didn't see no Xbox Ones or PlayStations

02:39:15.000 --> 02:39:17.000
apparently they got their shit together in Canada

02:39:17.000 --> 02:39:19.000
you know why? Everyone's happy

02:39:19.000 --> 02:39:21.000
because they're eating french fries smothered in gravy

02:39:21.000 --> 02:39:23.000
and, cheese curds

02:39:23.000 --> 02:39:25.000
alright, well I hate to break it to you, but they had no Pokemon

02:39:25.000 --> 02:39:27.000
oh

02:39:27.000 --> 02:39:29.000
dicks, I'm just kidding, alright

02:39:29.000 --> 02:39:31.000
is that why you went there?

02:39:31.000 --> 02:39:33.000
we're moving to Canada tomorrow, by the way

02:39:33.000 --> 02:39:35.000
so you went there, Zappi, to get Pokemon

02:39:35.000 --> 02:39:37.000
and you ended up with Xbox One?

02:39:37.000 --> 02:39:39.000
well, I was going to get the Pokemon from my boyfriend

02:39:39.000 --> 02:39:41.000
and, no

02:39:41.000 --> 02:39:43.000
oh, ok, alright

02:39:43.000 --> 02:39:45.000
well, how was the Xbox One?

02:39:45.000 --> 02:39:47.000
what'd you play?

02:39:47.000 --> 02:39:49.000
they had fours of five

02:39:49.000 --> 02:39:51.000
oh, ok, cool

02:39:51.000 --> 02:39:53.000
I'll say this, it's very pretty

02:39:53.000 --> 02:39:55.000
but there's one thing that really has me concerned

02:39:55.000 --> 02:39:57.000
they had this demo unit

02:39:57.000 --> 02:39:59.000
that looked like a complete factory finished Xbox

02:39:59.000 --> 02:40:01.000
and the game was stuttering

02:40:01.000 --> 02:40:03.000
like no tomorrow

02:40:03.000 --> 02:40:05.000
really?

02:40:05.000 --> 02:40:07.000
it's because it's not actually, it's just

02:40:07.000 --> 02:40:09.000
the PC and the

02:40:09.000 --> 02:40:11.000
units, I don't think it's actually the

02:40:11.000 --> 02:40:13.000
well, actually it's the test units, I think

02:40:13.000 --> 02:40:15.000
they had like a clear

02:40:15.000 --> 02:40:17.000
container for it, it looked like

02:40:17.000 --> 02:40:19.000
a finished Xbox One

02:40:19.000 --> 02:40:21.000
but it's probably not a finished version of the game, remember

02:40:21.000 --> 02:40:23.000
fours of five isn't done yet, they need to

02:40:23.000 --> 02:40:25.000
patch in the rest of the game when it comes out

02:40:25.000 --> 02:40:27.000
we're only a month out, too, I mean

02:40:27.000 --> 02:40:29.000
I would think that the real deal is starting to show up

02:40:29.000 --> 02:40:31.000
but this is the copy

02:40:31.000 --> 02:40:33.000
that they were confident enough to bring to a retail

02:40:33.000 --> 02:40:35.000
store and have people try out

02:40:35.000 --> 02:40:37.000
and you know, and funny

02:40:37.000 --> 02:40:39.000
enough, I was teasing Bobby Blackwolf

02:40:39.000 --> 02:40:41.000
because he has the show before us here at VOG Network

02:40:41.000 --> 02:40:43.000
and I was teasing him earlier because he was talking

02:40:43.000 --> 02:40:45.000
about demos, and I said, well you know, Bobby

02:40:45.000 --> 02:40:47.000
he will make his

02:40:47.000 --> 02:40:49.000
impression off a video game based off the demo

02:40:49.000 --> 02:40:51.000
and that's that, because I think back to Nino Cooney

02:40:51.000 --> 02:40:53.000
and how he refuses to play that full game

02:40:53.000 --> 02:40:55.000
because the demo was so awful, which it was

02:40:55.000 --> 02:40:57.000
but the game's really good

02:40:57.000 --> 02:40:59.000
I bring that up because, you know, if you're gonna

02:40:59.000 --> 02:41:01.000
make your impressions off this in-store

02:41:01.000 --> 02:41:03.000
demo unit, then yeah, it should run

02:41:03.000 --> 02:41:05.000
a little better than being stuttery all over

02:41:05.000 --> 02:41:07.000
the place

02:41:07.000 --> 02:41:09.000
besides that, it was very pretty

02:41:09.000 --> 02:41:11.000
the controller is really awesome, I want one of those

02:41:11.000 --> 02:41:13.000
and it plays like

02:41:13.000 --> 02:41:15.000
Forza

02:41:15.000 --> 02:41:17.000
but more like the old Forzas

02:41:17.000 --> 02:41:19.000
and not like Forza Horizon Arcady, right?

02:41:19.000 --> 02:41:21.000
no, no, it's like the numbered

02:41:21.000 --> 02:41:23.000
Forza games

02:41:23.000 --> 02:41:25.000
fair enough, were they

02:41:25.000 --> 02:41:27.000
showing anything else, like Killer Instinct or any of that

02:41:27.000 --> 02:41:29.000
or just Forza?

02:41:29.000 --> 02:41:31.000
nope, it was the Forza show

02:41:31.000 --> 02:41:33.000
they had two reps they probably trained over the

02:41:33.000 --> 02:41:35.000
weekend showing it off

02:41:35.000 --> 02:41:37.000
fair enough

02:41:37.000 --> 02:41:39.000
I was gonna say though

02:41:39.000 --> 02:41:41.000
since we were talking about Pokemon a minute ago

02:41:41.000 --> 02:41:43.000
have you tried playing the Pokemon in 3D?

02:41:43.000 --> 02:41:45.000
it kind of stutters too

02:41:45.000 --> 02:41:47.000
yeah, that was a little bit disappointing

02:41:47.000 --> 02:41:49.000
as soon as you turn off the 3D, it's perfectly fine

02:41:49.000 --> 02:41:51.000
but

02:41:51.000 --> 02:41:53.000
I guess that's why the whole game

02:41:53.000 --> 02:41:55.000
isn't in 3D to begin with

02:41:55.000 --> 02:41:57.000
they want you to not notice

02:41:57.000 --> 02:41:59.000
I guess so

02:41:59.000 --> 02:42:01.000
it's kind of interesting

02:42:01.000 --> 02:42:03.000
at the end of the day though

02:42:03.000 --> 02:42:05.000
maybe we are hitting that point

02:42:05.000 --> 02:42:07.000
because it's no big deal

02:42:07.000 --> 02:42:09.000
I don't feel short handed

02:42:09.000 --> 02:42:11.000
or like I'm losing something by not having the 3D

02:42:11.000 --> 02:42:13.000
you know what I mean?

02:42:13.000 --> 02:42:15.000
Dark Sakura, what the hell are you doing in chat?

02:42:15.000 --> 02:42:17.000
I don't know, I tried to put like one stupid little link

02:42:17.000 --> 02:42:19.000
and the whole thing copied

02:42:19.000 --> 02:42:21.000
and Dark Sakura got kicked for flooding the chat

02:42:21.000 --> 02:42:23.000
you know what?

02:42:23.000 --> 02:42:25.000
she was speaking in tongues

02:42:25.000 --> 02:42:27.000
that was actually a complete and total accident

02:42:27.000 --> 02:42:29.000
whoops, alright

02:42:29.000 --> 02:42:31.000
good job Dark Sakura

02:42:31.000 --> 02:42:33.000
sorry Zappi

02:42:33.000 --> 02:42:35.000
well the thing is, sure, 3D isn't that useful

02:42:35.000 --> 02:42:37.000
but this is what they sold the system on

02:42:37.000 --> 02:42:39.000
you have 3D games

02:42:39.000 --> 02:42:41.000
and it looks like they're moving away from the thing

02:42:41.000 --> 02:42:43.000
they were selling their own system on

02:42:43.000 --> 02:42:45.000
well, what's the verdict for you?

02:42:45.000 --> 02:42:47.000
are you on board with next gen gaming?

02:42:47.000 --> 02:42:49.000
are you gonna get an Xbox One

02:42:49.000 --> 02:42:51.000
or a Playstation 4?

02:42:51.000 --> 02:42:53.000
well I'm considering it just because

02:42:53.000 --> 02:42:55.000
I was able to pre-order an Xbox One

02:42:55.000 --> 02:42:57.000
for $100 off

02:42:59.000 --> 02:43:01.000
because I just used the staples to

02:43:01.000 --> 02:43:03.000
stack a whole bunch of coupons

02:43:03.000 --> 02:43:05.000
so you're gonna go

02:43:05.000 --> 02:43:07.000
Xbox One with that money off then?

02:43:07.000 --> 02:43:09.000
I'm thinking about it, because $400

02:43:09.000 --> 02:43:11.000
it puts it at the same price as a PS4

02:43:11.000 --> 02:43:13.000
that's true, if you can lessen the price

02:43:13.000 --> 02:43:15.000
Xbox One does have

02:43:15.000 --> 02:43:17.000
some exclusives that are

02:43:17.000 --> 02:43:19.000
worth looking at

02:43:19.000 --> 02:43:21.000
yeah, but on the other hand

02:43:21.000 --> 02:43:23.000
the launch line up just isn't there

02:43:23.000 --> 02:43:25.000
yeah, I hear ya

02:43:25.000 --> 02:43:27.000
he's waiting six months, so there's nothing wrong with that

02:43:27.000 --> 02:43:29.000
alright, well Zappi, I'm gonna let you go

02:43:29.000 --> 02:43:31.000
to see if anybody else calls, but thanks for calling

02:43:31.000 --> 02:43:33.000
I don't think we've heard from you in forever

02:43:33.000 --> 02:43:35.000
and it's good to hear the impressions of the Xbox One

02:43:35.000 --> 02:43:37.000
alright, cool, later

02:43:37.000 --> 02:43:39.000
next time, Pre-Poutine

02:43:39.000 --> 02:43:41.000
alright, sounds good, bye

02:43:41.000 --> 02:43:43.000
bye

02:43:43.000 --> 02:43:45.000
1877 Game OLR, our username on Skype

02:43:45.000 --> 02:43:47.000
Orange Lounge Radio

02:43:47.000 --> 02:43:49.000
I figured out what it did

02:43:49.000 --> 02:43:51.000
it actually copied the image data and not the URL

02:43:51.000 --> 02:43:53.000
I have no idea how that happened

02:43:53.000 --> 02:43:55.000
because I highlighted the URL to copy it

02:43:55.000 --> 02:43:57.000
so

02:43:57.000 --> 02:43:59.000
my iPad is currently the devil

02:43:59.000 --> 02:44:01.000
1877 Game OLR

02:44:01.000 --> 02:44:03.000
our username on Skype

02:44:03.000 --> 02:44:05.000
Orange Lounge Radio

02:44:05.000 --> 02:44:07.000
we need more poutine

02:44:07.000 --> 02:44:09.000
I'm trying to go to tweets and see what else has been tweeted at us tonight

02:44:09.000 --> 02:44:11.000
someone new should call us, I want new

02:44:11.000 --> 02:44:13.000
I mean, I love all of you people

02:44:13.000 --> 02:44:15.000
seriously, and I love talking with you, but we need someone new calling

02:44:15.000 --> 02:44:17.000
new voices, new blood

02:44:17.000 --> 02:44:19.000
we must sacrifice you to my iPad

02:44:19.000 --> 02:44:21.000
so that

02:44:21.000 --> 02:44:23.000
it doesn't spout

02:44:23.000 --> 02:44:25.000
devil noise at us, again

02:44:25.000 --> 02:44:27.000
actdef sent us a tweet, but it's a tweet from Eurogamer

02:44:27.000 --> 02:44:29.000
about the extension of the games for gold

02:44:29.000 --> 02:44:31.000
on 360, which I think we had talked about earlier

02:44:31.000 --> 02:44:33.000
I was trying to see if there was more games

02:44:33.000 --> 02:44:35.000
announced on it, but I don't think so

02:44:35.000 --> 02:44:37.000
I didn't realize they got the exact same games in Europe

02:44:37.000 --> 02:44:39.000
but I guess that makes sense, that they do

02:44:39.000 --> 02:44:41.000
um, Sturlock

02:44:41.000 --> 02:44:43.000
tweeted us saying, what was the music from tonight

02:44:43.000 --> 02:44:45.000
very awesome, well clearly

02:44:45.000 --> 02:44:47.000
you're talking about the song Always by

02:44:47.000 --> 02:44:49.000
Erasure, it's what we play during the FUGL

02:44:49.000 --> 02:44:51.000
we need more Erasure on the show

02:44:51.000 --> 02:44:53.000
we do, I can make that happen

02:44:53.000 --> 02:44:55.000
don't, uh, don't think I won't

02:44:55.000 --> 02:44:57.000
I think that's it for Twitter topics, I didn't get a whole lot tonight

02:44:57.000 --> 02:44:59.000
so, twitter.com slash OLR

02:44:59.000 --> 02:45:01.000
we need a new ending song

02:45:01.000 --> 02:45:03.000
and it should be all through the years

02:45:03.000 --> 02:45:05.000
alright, I'm gonna put out one more

02:45:05.000 --> 02:45:07.000
call for phone calls, and then we're gonna

02:45:07.000 --> 02:45:09.000
wrap it up, no, you should call tonight

02:45:09.000 --> 02:45:11.000
Seattle, do it now

02:45:11.000 --> 02:45:13.000
1877 game OLR

02:45:13.000 --> 02:45:15.000
or username on skype

02:45:15.000 --> 02:45:17.000
orange lounge radio

02:45:17.000 --> 02:45:19.000
and we're out of last minute stories, right

02:45:19.000 --> 02:45:21.000
yeah, is there any more

02:45:21.000 --> 02:45:23.000
food stories somebody wants to tell

02:45:23.000 --> 02:45:25.000
poutine

02:45:25.000 --> 02:45:27.000
I think they have that actually over at sprouts

02:45:27.000 --> 02:45:29.000
they, or even like uh, Whole Foods

02:45:29.000 --> 02:45:31.000
or something like that, they have like their weird food over there

02:45:31.000 --> 02:45:33.000
I could just make it at home

02:45:33.000 --> 02:45:35.000
yeah, it's not that difficult

02:45:35.000 --> 02:45:37.000
let's just sacrifice your face first

02:45:37.000 --> 02:45:39.000
alright, degenerate Johnny

02:45:39.000 --> 02:45:41.000
alright, well I guess nobody wants to call

02:45:41.000 --> 02:45:43.000
that makes me sad, so I'm gonna close up the skype line

02:45:43.000 --> 02:45:45.000
and I will encourage you guys to email us in a future week

02:45:45.000 --> 02:45:47.000
mailbag at orange lounge radio dot com

02:45:47.000 --> 02:45:49.000
or you can also send us a tweet

02:45:49.000 --> 02:45:51.000
twitter dot com slash OLR

02:45:51.000 --> 02:45:53.000
and uh, those are all the ways you can interact with us as well

02:45:53.000 --> 02:45:55.000
uh, otherwise

02:45:55.000 --> 02:45:57.000
that does it for another week of orange lounge radio

02:45:57.000 --> 02:45:59.000
I just wanna say thank you guys

02:45:59.000 --> 02:46:01.000
very much for listening to the show

02:46:01.000 --> 02:46:03.000
um, the nominating stuff is over

02:46:03.000 --> 02:46:05.000
for the podcast awards, but I do wanna give a quick

02:46:05.000 --> 02:46:07.000
thank you, if you did take the time out of your day to nominate us

02:46:07.000 --> 02:46:09.000
or at least nominate another deserving

02:46:09.000 --> 02:46:11.000
independent podcast, even if it wasn't

02:46:11.000 --> 02:46:13.000
us, I wanna say thank you

02:46:13.000 --> 02:46:15.000
and uh, we'll know the results of that, I think

02:46:15.000 --> 02:46:17.000
I think it's the same time as the show next week

02:46:17.000 --> 02:46:19.000
so that could be interesting

02:46:19.000 --> 02:46:21.000
so we can have our disappointment

02:46:21.000 --> 02:46:23.000
drinks when we don't get nominated

02:46:23.000 --> 02:46:25.000
we'll have a pile of poutine that we'll drown our sorrows in

02:46:25.000 --> 02:46:27.000
yes, fist bump

02:46:27.000 --> 02:46:29.000
poutine

02:46:29.000 --> 02:46:31.000
do you want some poutine, Loki?

02:46:31.000 --> 02:46:33.000
is that part of your diet?

02:46:33.000 --> 02:46:35.000
budget for it

02:46:35.000 --> 02:46:37.000
I don't think there's a ketogenic version of poutine

02:46:37.000 --> 02:46:39.000
just budget for it, that's all you have to do

02:46:39.000 --> 02:46:41.000
alright, um, thank you very much

02:46:41.000 --> 02:46:43.000
for listening to our show

02:46:43.000 --> 02:46:45.000
if you like what you heard here at orange lounge radio

02:46:45.000 --> 02:46:47.000
we don't ask for your money, all we do

02:46:47.000 --> 02:46:49.000
just tell a friend or 5 or 25

02:46:49.000 --> 02:46:51.000
about the program, help us spread the word

02:46:51.000 --> 02:46:53.000
about OLR and grow our family

02:46:53.000 --> 02:46:55.000
cause you know what, we've got some pretty cool people

02:46:55.000 --> 02:46:57.000
that listen to this show, both live

02:46:57.000 --> 02:46:59.000
and in the podcast forum, thank you very much

02:46:59.000 --> 02:47:01.000
for participating and being a part of it

02:47:01.000 --> 02:47:03.000
thank you very much

02:47:03.000 --> 02:47:05.000
you could also leave us a nice review on itunes

02:47:05.000 --> 02:47:07.000
stitcher, thumbs up, you know, all the places where you found this podcast

02:47:07.000 --> 02:47:09.000
other people will find podcasts too

02:47:09.000 --> 02:47:11.000
um, it's time to go around and get everybody's final thought

02:47:11.000 --> 02:47:13.000
Loki, starting us off tonight, your final thought

02:47:13.000 --> 02:47:15.000
uh, well

02:47:15.000 --> 02:47:17.000
we'll be playing more grant the thought of this week

02:47:17.000 --> 02:47:19.000
and hopefully you should see an announcement

02:47:19.000 --> 02:47:21.000
about the next game night

02:47:21.000 --> 02:47:23.000
we'll maybe do another game night

02:47:23.000 --> 02:47:25.000
or maybe we'll do like one week

02:47:25.000 --> 02:47:27.000
cause friday seems to be a lot better

02:47:27.000 --> 02:47:29.000
for people, cause it's hard to

02:47:29.000 --> 02:47:31.000
play, so maybe

02:47:31.000 --> 02:47:33.000
maybe we'll do another game night friday

02:47:33.000 --> 02:47:35.000
and then we'll switch it up to the next platform

02:47:35.000 --> 02:47:37.000
the next friday or something like that

02:47:37.000 --> 02:47:39.000
switch off until

02:47:39.000 --> 02:47:41.000
you know, some other games come out

02:47:41.000 --> 02:47:43.000
um, my final thought tonight is

02:47:43.000 --> 02:47:45.000
um, I don't know

02:47:45.000 --> 02:47:47.000
uh, I

02:47:47.000 --> 02:47:49.000
uh, I need to get working on my halloween costume

02:47:49.000 --> 02:47:51.000
cause I haven't started yet and I really need to do that

02:47:51.000 --> 02:47:53.000
and I need to not slack off

02:47:53.000 --> 02:47:55.000
and also I need to do more live game streaming

02:47:55.000 --> 02:47:57.000
cause I've been slacking off on that too, so

02:47:57.000 --> 02:47:59.000
uh, even though I was joking earlier about

02:47:59.000 --> 02:48:01.000
how everybody's live streaming, oh well

02:48:01.000 --> 02:48:03.000
I'm gonna do it too, cause there's some other

02:48:03.000 --> 02:48:05.000
games out there I'm playing that I wanna show you guys

02:48:05.000 --> 02:48:07.000
that aren't just Final Fantasy XIV, believe it or not

02:48:07.000 --> 02:48:09.000
and last but not least, Dark Soccer, your final thought tonight

02:48:09.000 --> 02:48:11.000
the closest thing I have to cheese

02:48:11.000 --> 02:48:13.000
courage is cottage cheese

02:48:13.000 --> 02:48:15.000
that sucks

02:48:15.000 --> 02:48:17.000
could you put cottage cheese on french fries?

02:48:17.000 --> 02:48:19.000
I can't eat french fries

02:48:19.000 --> 02:48:21.000
oh, alright

02:48:21.000 --> 02:48:23.000
you know what?

02:48:23.000 --> 02:48:25.000
I feel healthier

02:48:25.000 --> 02:48:27.000
I feel healthier than I have in the last three weeks

02:48:27.000 --> 02:48:29.000
and I wanna start

02:48:29.000 --> 02:48:31.000
playing DDR again, that's my final thought

02:48:31.000 --> 02:48:33.000
alright, good luck

02:48:33.000 --> 02:48:35.000
I wanna make it a thing

02:48:35.000 --> 02:48:37.000
alright, well

02:48:37.000 --> 02:48:39.000
that's the end of this thing for tonight

02:48:39.000 --> 02:48:41.000
we'll be back next Sunday, seven days

02:48:41.000 --> 02:48:43.000
to do it all over again, yet another thing

02:48:43.000 --> 02:48:45.000
just in time for halloween with episode

02:48:45.000 --> 02:48:47.000
