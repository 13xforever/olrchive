00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:18.000
Tonight GTA Online opens for gamers to experience the latest load screen simulator

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
The Neo Geo X is ordered to be pulled from shells

00:20.000 --> 00:22.000
Nintendo announces another hit game delay

00:22.000 --> 00:25.000
And could SimCity finally become playable offline?

00:25.000 --> 00:27.000
All this and more begins right now

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet

00:33.000 --> 00:35.000
And welcome back to another week of the show

00:35.000 --> 00:37.000
Where every gamer has a voice

00:37.000 --> 00:39.000
It is Orange Lounge Radio

00:39.000 --> 00:43.000
Live with episode number 522

00:43.000 --> 00:47.000
For this October the 6th of 2013

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
It is officially October

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
Only how many more days to Halloween? 25

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
If I did my math right

00:53.000 --> 00:56.000
And she'll keep me in check for sure

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
Here she is everybody

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
DarkSakura or Jamie Summers?

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
Meh

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
No it's not on, now it's on meh

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
Did I do my math right?

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
I don't care

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
Math sucks

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
Why are you meh? Sunday is fun day

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
Because I'm waiting for Halloween to be over

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
So I can buy Purim costumes

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
Fair enough

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
And then get all the candy on sale

01:20.000 --> 01:24.000
And then make like candy corn muffins or something

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
Actually I am planning

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
Even though I'm not doing sugar very much

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
I'm planning on making candy corn vodka

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
Hooray

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
Vodka doesn't count

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
If you're gonna drink something

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
Vodka is the best for you anyway

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
Well it liquefies the candy corn

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
So it's like candy corn syrup mixed in vodka

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
Oh my gosh

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
I bet some people would find that absolutely disgusting though

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
It's amazeballs

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
I have to ask you though, what do you think about

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
Because we do talk about video games

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
The gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle, it is a video game show

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
But let's be real, it's also a foodie show

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
Because we always talk about food on this show

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
So I have to ask you DarkSaga

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
What do you think about this time of year

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
Where it's pumpkin all the things

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
And then candy corn

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
And it's like candy corn oreos

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
This is the time of year

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
That I actually make my

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
I kind of call it gourd soup

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
But I make

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
Butternut squash pumpkin and sweet potato soup

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
Yummy

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
And it's really creamy

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
But now the way that I make these is I make them all savory

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
So I put like garlic and rosemary

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
And all kinds of savory herbs in it

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
So that it's sweet and savory at the same time

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
And you guys, she's gonna bring some to the next show

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
Yay! Maybe I will

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
I've actually got the stuff to make my soup

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
And this time I have

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
Purple mountain yams

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
To add in it this time

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
This sounds delicious, I can't wait

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
All the listeners are hungry now

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
But everybody should be jealous of my amazing dinner

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
Because I had rabbit and beef liver

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
For dinner

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
You know what, Bugs was delicious

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
If my sister could hear you

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
She would hate you, she's a bunny enthusiast

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
And she loves bunnies

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
I love bunnies too, they're fun and I'm allergic to them

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
But they're soft and fun to pet and delicious

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
Alright look

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
Going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
We'll start off tonight with

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
Rama who says, too much fucking pumpkin

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
Yo

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
Well, even our chatters have wrong opinions sometimes

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
Here at Orange Lounge Radio

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
But after all it is the show where every gamer has a voice

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
I don't like pumpkin

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
And there he is, Techmaster Loki, what's wrong with you?

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
I don't like pumpkin

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
You don't like pumpkin? No

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
Well some people think I'm weird

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
Because I don't like mayonnaise

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
I don't think I introduced myself, I'm Rob Roberts by the way

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
If you don't know me, I'm Rob Roberts and I hate mayonnaise

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
I can understand eating straight up mayonnaise

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
But honest sandwich is fine

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
Or chicken salad

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
Or everything with mayonnaise

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
Okay, Alan and I went and got sushi

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
And we got this one roll and I was kind of like

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
Think that's a mayo based sauce

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
And I'm going to have to kind of like eat the edges

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
You know what, I got sushi the other day

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
And I had an allergic reaction to it

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
Because you know what was mixed in with the crab?

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
What? Sriracha

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
Oh no, sriracha crab?

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
That's weird It was how they made their spicy crab

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
They mixed sriracha in with the crab

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
And normally I'm fine with spicy crab

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
Because it's just like maybe a little

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
Something else hot, but they mixed sriracha in it

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
Which I'm like stupidly allergic to

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
So I actually still have a hive

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
And it hurts

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
Let's see, going to Raginator in our chat room

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
Says pumpkin flavored mayonnaise

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
I'm sorry, that won't work for me

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
Just like it probably won't work for Loki

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
That's not okay

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
Well here's the thing, I don't understand

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
Like putting mayonnaise on like

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
Hot things

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
You know like with a sandwich it's okay

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
But like people put it on burgers

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
Or they'll like get a sandwich at like a sandwich place

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
Yeah I like that toasted

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
It's like okay cool, now it's like this nasty

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
Hot mayonnaise

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
I am literally gagging right now

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
And I don't mean like fashion runway

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
I'm gagging at that, I mean like I am actually about to barf

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
When you're talking about that

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
I won't tell you about what my mom used to eat as a snack

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
No, ugh

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
Canned pears with mayonnaise and cheese

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
This is horrible I actually grew up on that

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
It's pretty good Alright look, we need to talk about video games

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
What about like a mayonnaise flavored

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
Flurry or something like that

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
What's wrong with you people? I like homemade mayonnaise

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
As a garnish on dishes

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
Look, be nice everybody and respectful

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
Cause we got a guest here in studio tonight

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
I bet she likes mayonnaise

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
She might, we're gonna say hello to our guest here

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
It's actually her second time on the show

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
But you know welcome back

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
As the case may be to Chell is here tonight

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
Well thank you very much for having me

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
Chell, I think you can like

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
Chow? Chell

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
Chell, it's Chell, I keep thinking Chell

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
You're a hero and a half Chell

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
Sorry Chell

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
You know the computer name

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
from Portal I can't even think about

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
pronouncing in real life so you're in good company

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
Alright fair enough

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
So you were on the show before

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
and you talked about what kinds of things

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
We did talk about your love of Portal on the last show

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
Oh yes and my deep deep love affair

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
with Earthbound slash Mother

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
Have you seen, I think this happened after

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
you were on the show, have you seen it's on Wii U virtual console now?

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
No I did not

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
I could get that puppy over here right

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
now for you to check out, it's awesome

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
That would be awesome

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
I need to play more of it to be honest

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
Have you checked out anything lately?

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
I know we're going to get into gaming weeks a little later

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
but what kind of stuff have you been into in general

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
as of late?

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
Since I've been busy, I've been getting my nostalgia on

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
with old Lucas Arts stuff and

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
a lot of free RPG stuff

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
You people light up my life

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
with your independent

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
RPGs that are fan made stuff

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
but at the same time guys

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
sometimes you need to work on your programming

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
because you know

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
I want to meet you half way but

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
when I no clip into a shelf

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
yeah

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
There's such good stuff out there though

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
There are a lot of great indie RPGs

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
and the great thing about RPGs is that

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
they take forever to beat usually

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
so they're a great time sink and I'm thinking of things like

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
Cthulhu Saves the World

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
Have you played any of that stuff?

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
Adorbs

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
Are you a Steam user?

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
My computer is broke as hell

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
It's also 4 years old

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
It's doing some interesting breakage right now in fact

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
Well if you're able to

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
put some band aids on it

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
check out Steam and some of these indie

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
RPGs are like $1.50

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
Nice

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
They'll be a winner sale as there always is

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
going into New Years and such this year

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
It'll be like

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
hand us a couple quarters and here's like 50 games

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
Sales all the things

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
Exactly

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
That's something we're bringing up in part B for people

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
who are not on Steam

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
Absolutely a little teaser

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
So Chell will have to pay attention

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
in part B there will be a quiz tonight

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
I don't know if they told you there will be a quiz

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
What other stuff do you do for fun Chell?

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
I haven't been doing much fun lately

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
I've mostly been working on just

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
getting stuff for my degree together

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
I'm working on a lot of

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
learning 3D stuff because one day I hope to

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
join the unwashed masses

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
and start churning out games like I want to play

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
Awesome

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
Have you thought about what would be your dream

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
company to work for?

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
Well Valve obviously

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
The minute the words left my mouth

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
that was the stupid

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
Rob doesn't usually ask stupid questions

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
haha at least I had to tell myself

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
but that one was pretty dumb

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
It's not just that

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
they make games that I want to play

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
it's that they seem like a really

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
chill workforce

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
Have you seen that leaked handbook

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
that's online that's like the Valve company

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
handbook like what the employees

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
get you know their corporate

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
culture is so interesting

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
Valve like I really

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
it's just so neat and like I kind of

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
think about like gosh if they try to do something

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
like that at my day job I just I don't know

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
something like that would fly like some industries

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
need structure but it's so interesting as

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
Valve has really pulled off this

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
everybody's equal we don't have

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
titles your desk is on

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
wheels and you roll it where you need to go

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
and we don't tell you what to do

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
you find projects

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
like you guys have to Google

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
this if you've never seen this before the Valve handbook

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
and technically I don't know if it's legit

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
or not but it seems like it

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
would be I have no reason to doubt it

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
Sounds pretty close yeah

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
and it's just like so interesting

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
that you know

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
a person might

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
start work at this company and they don't have any

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
assignments so they just have to go like find

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
something to do but that's the type

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
of people they're looking for

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
yeah work raising

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
alright well unfortunately as we're broadcasting

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
live here we're having a little bit of stream troubles

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
I'm going to keep going for the sake of the

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
podcast but for some reason

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
we're not actually able to reconnect

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
and what's going on

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
is actually on server room's

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
side because

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
we are not able to reconnect at all

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
so I'm going to try to

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
keep this show going while doing tech

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
at the same time

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
alright

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
I

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
well you know what we could go

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
and bring up our

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
next topic we could

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
or I have another idea too is that

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
since this is for the sake of the podcast

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
why don't we do a quick musical interlude

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
while we try to fix things

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
and then we'll be right back I could sing

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
alright you want to sing us out

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
fly me to the moon

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
no

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
To register participation for this week's episode

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
use the pass phrase dash

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
alright we're back that wasn't awkward

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
or anything but the joys

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
of doing live radio is

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
that sometimes the feed just

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
the internets go down there's a

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
server reboot or something happens

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
and the tubes get

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
untied or I don't know what happens

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
just being a butthole or a cat

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
just pulled out the plug let's be real

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
that's probably what happened but for

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
once that wasn't our fault at least I can say

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
so alright

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
where were we when we left off

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
I was talking to the lovely Chell

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
over there about the dream company

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
she wanted to work for we were talking about Valve

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
and just kind of

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
what a different type of company

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
Valve is so let me ask you this

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
knowing that the employees at Valve can work on

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
whatever project they want

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
if you were to get hired by Valve

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
hypothetically what would be your dream

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
project?

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
Barring Half Life Part 3

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
which may or may not be a thing

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
make sure that mics on by the way

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
siblings, siblings

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
so Barring Half Life Part 3

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
oh

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
that is a tough one

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
I really always wanted to

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
see a Portal sequel but I just wanted to

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
work on something new and fresh

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
coming down the pipe

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
they kind of hit me where I live

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
story wise everything

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
they put out is just

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
right along the lines of what I try to bring into my fiction

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
just you know the continuing themes

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
of kind of being alone

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
in a strange place and having to kind of survive

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
through strange circumstances

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
you are a little quiet by the way

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
just make sure you talk right in that mic

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
so

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
you would hope to work on Half Life 3

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
or something kind of new

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
because I'm a little fancy

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
speaking of new and fancy, Valve did make a bunch of announcements

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
last week about this Steam Box

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
have you been following this news at all?

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
I'm completely out of the loop

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
that's why we're here

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
to help you stay current

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
the Steam Box they announced is

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
it's going to have its own operating system

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
SteamOS which you can put on any computer

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
it's basically a version of Linux

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
and then they're going to be selling these computers

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
that are basically

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
it's kind of to rival consoles a little bit

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
to bring PC gaming closer to living room

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
but they'll be all these different types

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
there's no way they're going to be console prices

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
Loki's shaking us out over there, no way huh?

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
well did you see what the test specs are?

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
the test specs are going to have Titans in them

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
oh wow

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
like the super super super high end

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
Nvidia cards

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
I hope I'm one of the lucky 300 people that gets one of those

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
exactly, I'm like dude I

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
I could totally use a new PC and that would be awesome

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
just to get like

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
something like that

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
even the low end was like a

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
I think like a 680

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
that's still way better than I've got now

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
nice

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
and WhattupG says how about that new controller for the Steam Box

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
yes don't forget there is that little controller too

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
with the fancy little

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
it's really kind of weird, it's got like thumb sticks

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
but they're like touch pads

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
it's interesting, it's different

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
you know it's not the same old same old

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
anything with like a million joysticks

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
makes me want to hiss and run into a corner

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
I mean that's one of my main issues with

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
one of my continuing issues with Xbox

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
remember when Nintendo announced the Wii

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
and they came out with that Wiimote

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
and a lot of people were like it's really like simple

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
and Nintendo was like that's the point

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
so many people are intimidated

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
by all the buttons like on an Xbox

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
or a Playstation controller

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
the nice thing about the Wii controller is that

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
you know yes there's some smaller buttons

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
but for a lot of people there's just one big giant button

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
that says A and then the little trigger thing

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
and that's why so many senior citizens do the bowling

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
and all that you know

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
you think they learned from the clusterfuck that was the N64 controller

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
which was a good controller

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
but still

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
exactly

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
it gives me horrible horrible flashbacks to

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
Rebel Alliance N64

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
my brother having me help

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
hold down all the buttons so he can just

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
oh god

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
alright well Chell will be talking to you

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
about the news and such throughout the show

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
please feel free to chime in as you like

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
to have your say on whatever's going on

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
and those of you in chat rooms

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
same thing for you guys live.vognetwork.com

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
and Act F says

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
Loki that's only for the prototypes

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
Act F says the retail version

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
of the Steam Machine will probably offer

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
lower specs

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
for the prototypes it has the really kickass cards

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
of course you do

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
Daddy I want the golden

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
Steam Box Daddy

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
I want it

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
what do you mean I can't have it

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
I want the whole world

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
alright

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
I wanted to do a quick kick off topic here

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
and we are running a little behind because of the live stuff

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
so I'll just quickly talk about tonight

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
I know right

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
we're only ever here for like 4 hours

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
this is going to be a big week in gaming

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
I don't know if you want us to admit it or not

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
because Saturday October 12th

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
sees the release of

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
Pokemon X and Y

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
you're not a Pokemon fan

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
no

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
why not

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
because I have other things to like

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
like free time

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
I see

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
so you value your time

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
so much that you don't want to get sucked into Pokemon

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
because you see how Pokemon ruins lives

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
yeah thanks Shane

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
no no

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
the last one I played was Pearl

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
and I only ever played it at the gym

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
which was ironic because I was going to gyms

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
at the gym

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
ha ha ha

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
and I just

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
I don't know why that's so funny

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
but I'm laughing

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
so here's a Pokemon gym

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
so you can go to the gym at your gym

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
be funny

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
because if I were a dude

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
I could be gym

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
ha ha

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
oh my god stop

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
so

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
Rob's red

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
this is like one of those nights

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
where anything's funny

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
because there's probably people out there listening

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
going Rob it wasn't that funny

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
it's not that funny

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
alright hater

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
why are you hating

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
on the Pokemon

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
it's not serious I'm into

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
and don't get me wrong I understand that there are fans of it

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
I was just thinking

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
that's probably why they have Shane working at a certain company

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
because he is the crack dealer

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
for getting people into any game

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
and they have him behind

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
Pokemon

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
I've said this on Horde House

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
that Shane was born to do sales

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
that's where his ultimate calling

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
is going to end up being someday

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
stop making this the Shane show

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
I'm sure he's listening very happy

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
that we're talking Pokemon

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
I don't understand it

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
the way I look at a Madden release

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
it's like oh cool

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
instead of colors this time it's X and Y

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
cool

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
and that means nothing to me

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
other than I assume that there's just going to be a few more

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
Pokemon

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
and you have to collect those

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
to add to your ever large collection

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
of Pokemon that you battle each other

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
for whatever reason

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
I don't understand

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
if you are moving in that direction

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
I'm kind of disappointed that there is an opportunity

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
for a chromosome so you get Pokemon with some

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
autosomal disorders

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
you've got the down syndrome Pokemon

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
that you have to help a little out

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
but he's punched for it

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
yeah he's pulling for you

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
that would have taken gaming into a whole new area

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
what about aspie Pokemon

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
where they take everything really literal

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
and then

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
yeah

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
and I'm allowed to say that

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
so I'm looking at our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
and actdeft says

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
Jim at the gym

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
Jimception

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
alright

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
need to go down another level

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
let's see

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
blackwolf says Loki's not into Pokemon because

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
it's not Grand Theft Auto

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
well to be fair we had a

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
discussion last week where Jamie's like I'm not that

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
into Grand Theft Auto and now this week

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
I'm not that into Pokemon

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
and to be fair if they had some sort of mini game in Grand Theft Auto

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
where you had to raise dogs and fight them or something

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
like Michael Vick of Pokemon

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
I still probably wouldn't play that

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
because that sounds stupid

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
I don't know

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
I'm not into that type of game

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
especially if it has to do with

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
raising stuff

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
I blame the 10 dogs for that

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
because that made any sort of raising

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
of anything extremely boring

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
hey cute puppies what's wrong with that

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
oh everything because have you raised a dog before

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
it's not all

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
petting and playing

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
frisbee and stuff you have to fucking feed

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
that shit, wash it

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
you're going to be cleaning poop all day

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
they just want attention all goddamn hours of the day

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
come to think of it

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
right after I quit wow was after the whole

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
Pokemon mode came out

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
so maybe that has something to do with it too

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
to Loki's thing

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
they put Pokemon in wow

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
and I quit

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
huh

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
I thought we all quit because of LFR

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
that was the real reason anyway

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
I liked LFR to be honest

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
just because

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
I could just pew pew stuff

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
and as long as I didn't fuck up

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
which I never fucked up

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
I'd get pissed off at other people fucking up

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
but then it gave me an excuse to be mad at somebody else

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
my one issue with Pokemon

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
I like Pokemon as a franchise

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
I respect the games

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
I understand why people love them

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
and I really did love the old anime

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
judge me all you want but it was great

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
my one thing with Pokemon

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
that really got to me was that

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
it's kind of a grind fest

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
that you have to like and only the ones

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
you send into the fight actually get

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
XP and it's like oh my gosh

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
I gotta grind this and grind this

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
and it's like the OCD gamer in me and like

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
Shane has tried to tell me this like why are you

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
leveling up all your Pokemon you only need like

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
three of them to be really good to go somewhere

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
and I'm like you don't understand how I play

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
RPGs

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
yeah I totally get that it sets off my OCD

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
like woah it's like 100% completion

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
and it's in the lyrics

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
I want to be the very best

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
first sentence

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
yeah that re-release of the first

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
three games when you've got all the new

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
areas and you've got the three new islands

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
I thought it was never gonna crawl out of my room

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
I was gonna crawl out of it to die basically

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
and not for water or food or anything

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
so here's why I'm really excited

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
about X and Y is that apparently they're gonna

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
have this experience sharing so that now

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
you can actually level everything

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
that's in your party at once

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
new based Pokemon

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
I am so excited

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
so we'll see

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
no putting Magikarp into battle first

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
and hoping like hell

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
but you gotta admit

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
once you got Gyarados

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
everyone was fucked

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
it was worth it

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
so worth it

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
and I have to say that

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
Pokemon has offered me comfort over the years

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
my Charmander pillow

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
was my AX pillow

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
and my Togepi was my present

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
after I got held up at gunpoint

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
oh my gosh

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
you know that happened

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
I found $10 in the parking lot

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
and Dan gave me another $10

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
and I bought a Togepi

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
and I still have my Togepi

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
I love Togepi so cute

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
alright so

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
it sounds to me like there's

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
half gonna get it and half not gonna

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
get Pokemon

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
so we'll see

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
Pokemon is like STDs

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
you don't gotta catch them all

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
stop

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
alright and of course

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
there's the mandatory

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
actdeft in chat says how about them

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
mudkips? shut up

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
alright Matt Cube says

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
it is popular because it is a simple RPG

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
well you know I don't wanna spoil the

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
frugal question of the week cause we're gonna get into it

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
a little later but I just will say in general

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
I'm hearing a lot of people that are

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
really attached to Pokemon

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
and the reason behind it a lot of times

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
is that we're from that certain generation

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
where like we were like

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
13, 15 when these games

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
first came out

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
and so we've really kinda stuck to it the whole time

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
so for many people yeah it kinda was

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
the first RPG

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
they should totally go the route where

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
your Pokemon catch diseases

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
where you have to put them down with a shotgun

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
they do catch diseases

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
Pikachu has rabies

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
you have to decapitate them to figure it out

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
they get like burn and paralyzed

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
and all that

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
is it a sick burn?

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
right. Pikachu you're lame

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
burn oh no

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
it was very effective

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
little mini game where they have burn

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
outside of battle and you gotta

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
swath them in gauze and take them to the hospital

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
and they've got like 5 weeks of recovery

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
and then nurse joy won't let you

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
have them because you have to be evaluated

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
for being a Pokemon crudely

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
nurse joy is my favorite

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
she's my absolute

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
favorite character next to jigglypuff

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
and the whole thing is nurse joy

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
you know they had like

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
I think a new mini series of Pokemon that they're

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
putting out yeah they are somebody was just asking me

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
in chat about it too oh my god oh my god oh my god

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
ok I have to talk about this did you see that gif

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
that's going around on tumblr

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
of like a Squirtle beating the shit out of a

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
Charmander and Red's like there with his mouth

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
I'll be like holy shit

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
I mean beating the shit out

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
of him and he's like no come back

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
literally forcing his fist

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
into his ass and shit is popping out

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
god why are you being nasty

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
it's a gif I'll have to find it on tumblr

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
but it's like seriously just like

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
going full on ballistic

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
it's hilarious finding a gif on tumblr

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
man that is like a needle in a haystack right there

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
it's a particular one shut up

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
alpha kenanagram says are you gonna watch

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
we'll talk more pokemons later

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
but I

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
think I made my decision I will

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
say as far as pokemon goes I'm going to get

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
hold on shut

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
up I'm gonna get pokemon

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
why I've decided I'm gonna get pokemon

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
why and

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
I'll tell you my starter

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
pokemon

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
a little later in the show alright

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
let's talk about our gaming weeks

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
and the types of games that we have been playing

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
this week ladies first

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
dark sakura what have you been up to this week

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
I've been playing some stuff I actually did get on

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
final fantasy 14 but I was

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
kind of drunk at the time and

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
getting really motion sick so I stopped

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
and I finally

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
beat level 19 on fractal

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
I am so freaking happy because

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
it was pissing me off so now I'm on like

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
23 fractal is

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
pretty much video gaming crack

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
and thank you rob

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
for gifting

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
bejeweled 2 to me

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
because I

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
played the crap load of that but it's still more

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
fun on my phone that actually was

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
left over from some giveaways we did a long

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
time ago we just never

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
I mean it's bejeweled 2 it was a long time

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
ago so actually popcap gave that to you by

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
proxy but I like the the puzzle

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
mode in the computer version

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
it's actually pretty fun but for the most part

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
and act deft I cannot

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
look at videos on my ipad while

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
I'm doing the show sorry

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
he linked the video

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
luckily I can bring up videos

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
rick rolled so help me god I'm gonna get the

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
oh my heavens

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
that is the most gruesome

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
thing I've ever seen

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
those are that was

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
squirtle taking cream was

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
not okay

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
a bite out of charmander's neck

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
no the audio had to be

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
even worse because

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
that sounded like

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
I don't know that was that was not

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
okay that high pitched screaming

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
that was that was a little too

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
that was a little too visually vague for me

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
yeah act

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
deft I want you to apologize to the listeners

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
right now poor charmander

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
at live that is a rabid

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
squirtle that squirtle needs

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
to be put down oh my god that sound

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
was horrible although

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
it has settled the age old debate of

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
reptiles versus amphibians

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
because you know

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
turtles and salamanders natural enemies

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
so I played other games

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
that did involve squirtles biting

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
the crap out of charmander's

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
and the ahhhh

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
ahhhh

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
act deft says

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
sorry I'm so sorry

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
good good mean

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
it

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
next time loki goes on to one of his

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
rants I'm just going to have that queued up

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
oh I did buy something on sale

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
on steam oh what

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
I bought bioshock infinite last night

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
oh yeah they've been having six bucks

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
uber sales 13 is 13

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
and also half life 2

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
is like

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
3 dollars so I picked that up for

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
pc so that

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
you know I don't have to hurt my

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
hand playing it on xbox

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
so yeah I've

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
I just pretty much oh yeah and of course

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
my crack my animal crack

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
animal crossing animal cracking

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
which just

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
to say I'm actually considering busting out

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
the gamecube again and

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
playing my double

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
2 no mori why not because you can

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
unlock the nes cartridges

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
well yeah well the one that I have

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
there were two versions that came out on

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
gamecube there was

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
double 2 no mori plus which is the one

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
I have which was what

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
then we got a better one in america after

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
that and so that one was re-released in japan

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
as e plus well wasn't the original

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
original n64

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
I was n64 and we never got that

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
no however the

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
the whole reason I bought the import version

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
was to help me practice learning

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
reading japanese

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
because my

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
reading comprehension is not all that

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
great I read very

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
slowly so it was to help me

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
learn to

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
read better and so I'm gonna

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
be starting with that and I'm also trying to find

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
kids books to help me practice reading

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
so yeah

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
I've been I'm probably gonna be sort of

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
doubling up on my animal crossing

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
in the next few weeks

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
um and

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
then um dan is

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
all like starting to

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
get on fire emblem but then he's

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
back on gta 5 so

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
I'm like are you gonna be done

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
he's like well wait until blah blah

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
comes out and you're never gonna see the ds

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
again I'm like you watch and you're

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
not touching the game because I'm playing animal crossing

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
and I

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
am still trying to get the

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
stupid kitchen island but none of the

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
islands ever have it so fuck the

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
fucking fuckers but I have a tan now

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
so you have to go to the island

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
to get your island

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
to get a tan yeah to get

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
my island oh so

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
there's too much this and a that

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
I'll suction

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
but for anyone who wants to know

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
how to keep your tan in the winter

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
months go visit the island in the morning

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
and don't wear

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
a hat

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
some of the hats actually block you from getting tanned

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
is it real life is it animal crossing

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
I don't know anymore people

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
I don't know anymore hey my character is cute

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
alright act up

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
do you need to give me that

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
act up has a

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
kitchen island that needs to give it to me can't you like

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
visit his town and order it I'm

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
plugging in right now

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
nice

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
she took

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
my ds charger off my

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
ds charger off the table

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
and going I'm taking this

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
this is mine now because there's an island

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
for me to go steal from somebody else

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
she's stealing from two people

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
nine tenths of the law

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
don't encourage her alright

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
Chell while you're still on my good

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
side how was your gaming week

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
oh you know pretty chill you know

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
when I get a free minute

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
usually during school months

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
I'm kind of a casual gamer

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
mostly been getting my pc game on

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
can I plug something on there

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
so there's

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
this one indie game coming out

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
I've only played the demo so far

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
but oh man you know it's

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
I think it's made

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
an RPG maker something very similar

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
it's called Undertale

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
and the lead creator is Toby Fox

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
man you know give money

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
to this developer any way

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
you can if he's walking by throw money at his head

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
because this was like just the demo

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
just blew me away it has all the emotional

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
punches of earthbound which I'm pretty partial

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
too what'd you say this guy's name was

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
Toby Fox oh that poor guy

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
you know has got to be getting asked what does the

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
fox say she is encouraging bags of pennies

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
to be flung at his head

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
he will thank you through the tears

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
cause you know

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
he had a kickstarter and you know that

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
closed but you know this comes out

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
buy it you will thank yourself after you

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
stop crying which maybe never

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
wait so is like crying laughter

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
or crying like this game is really sad

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
or crying like they punch you in the emotions

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
and not even necessarily sad but it's

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
a really beautiful unique game experience

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
the whole thing is you're this kid

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
lost in this kind of underground place so

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
you know earthbound kind of

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
so the combat

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
is kind of unique the combat system is

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
you can choose to spare a monster

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
or fight them

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
and the whole you know this has been kind of

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
done before but it affects how

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
people interact with you and

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
yeah no it's saying

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
what I love about it will

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
spoil it that's how much you need to go

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
out and like play the demo and yeah

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
throw money at him hopefully paper

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
that's fair because there's

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
like in the beginning

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
when I first played Journey and since the game

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
has been out for like over a year now I think

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
it's fair for me to spoil it especially

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
cause I think everybody knows this twist

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
I said it was best to go on a journey to not

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
know that it's secretly a multiplayer game

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
because that so

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
enriches the experience cause the twist in Journey is that

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
you're not alone on the journey

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
and you can't communicate with the other person

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
though except through little hums

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
and like I can't even

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
explain like it's really just something you have to

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
experience like the bond you

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
start to feel with this little

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
thing that

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
you know is a real person

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
but is it like it's so hard

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
to explain I'm like but it was one of those things

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
because I didn't know when I played it for the first

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
time that that was like the twist in the game

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
I was like I want everybody to play Journey

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
like that where they find out that twist

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
on their own and I think that kind of keeps it

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
like all the more shocking

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
I'm sorry you just

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
the chat room made me think of another game

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
I'm playing Mass Effect 3 again

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
of course of course you know emotional manipulation

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
I'm all for that

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
I've also you know I really

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
need to pick up the first Darkness but I've also been playing

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
Darkness 2 cause I'm

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
so topical and you know I really

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
I'm enjoying the gameplay

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
but mostly I'm playing it for Mike Patton's juicy

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
juicy voice

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
fair enough

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
yeah you know I know it's been set up and down

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
but no post production the man

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
is demonically good

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
awesome

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
alright well I'm sure

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
the indie scene supports

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
or loves the fact that you're plugging that

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
stuff so yeah by all means

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
is there a website that you know off the top of your head?

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
well they've got a Tumblr and

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
it's just search Undertale

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
they should pop up I think they've got an official site

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
but so far it's just got the demo

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
on it the Tumblr is mostly posting

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
fan art right now and updates which are kinda

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
sparse and you know

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
I'm doing this completely unprompted

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
which you know I might appreciate

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
a game kicked my way someday

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
fair enough

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
not naming any names Toby Fox

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
alright

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
alright well let's move on then

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
if that's everything Chell has for now

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
over to Loki, Loki how was your gaming week?

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
I just played Grand Theft Auto

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
oh Mass Effect

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
there's a shock

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
to be fair I see Tim Tripp

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
in the chat room says oh man I missed

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
the Mass Effect tiers that's kinda what prompted

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
Jamie to go down that path she was

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
she was provoked by chat

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
but yeah Grand Theft Auto Online

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
and how's that going? well I heard

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
it had kind of a rough start

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
well yeah like any MMO this

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
they pretty much ironed it out after about three days

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
so it's working

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
so just quickly like I'm sure a lot

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
of people have experienced first hand and done it but

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
what do you do in Grand Theft Auto Online

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
what's the game? well there's an actual

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
storyline that goes along with it so basically

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
your character comes a little Santos after

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
Lamar which is Franklin's

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
friend in the single player game

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
he like follows you on Life Invader

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
which is their version of Facebook and

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
so he comes and you come into town and you're

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
doing jobs for different people they have

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
a guy Simeon that you're doing

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
repos for there's

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
some other guys that you're

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
doing like drug stuff for

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
getting you know stealing

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
meth from people and

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
that's just like the missions and then

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
on top of all that you can do the free

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
roaming stuff or you can rob liquor stores

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
you can steal cars

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
you can just

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
shoot people you know one on one do that stuff

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
or there's races, death

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
matches

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
you can do skydiving

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
stuff a whole bunch of

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
different activities in the game

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
and it's up to 16 players

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
and you get randomly thrown in

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
with some people usually

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
and then on top of that you can do these death

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
matches and stuff with other people so

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
a lot of times what I've found is I'm

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
getting dumped in a game I'll go do a mission or something

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
I'll come back and it's not the same people in the same

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
you know world anymore it's like

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
a whole different set of people

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
did you have something to add to that Chell?

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
I was just gonna say

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
kids don't take drugs

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
buy your own

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
don't

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
say that

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
but I've been enjoying it so far and you get to

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
create how your character looks based off of

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
like your ancestry and stuff

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
they have different people

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
that you pick as your grandparents

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
and your parents and then

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
or you pick the grandparents and that alters

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
what the parents look like and then

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
that alters what you look like

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
and I heard and I was reading an email

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
a little bit ahead of the game so I apologize

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
to the emailer I'm gonna spoil a little bit of their email

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
but I heard you can be a woman

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
in Grand Theft Auto Online

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
so that kind of helps the whole like you can never

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
be one but you can in Grand Theft Auto Online

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
yeah well you could

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
in 4 as well you could play a female

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
character in 4 for the online stuff

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
and of course your character is silent

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
so you know it's

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
whatever but yeah it's been a lot of fun

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
I've been enjoying it there's been a few people

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
that I've played with and stuff on there

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
but you know there's the

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
occasional kids

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
that are on there and stuff like I've had

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
a few people try to come kill me and it's great

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
cause you know that they're trying to kill you cause you see

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
them like I'm going to the store to go buy some

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
guns or something like that and I see this

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
guy just like posting up outside

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
and trying to hide and stuff and

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
it's funny cause they try to come in and shoot

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
me but you can't shoot in the store cause

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
when you walk in the store your gun disappears

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
so they have to wait outside the store

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
and so I know they're doing that so

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
immediately when I go out there I switch my gun and

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
I shoot them cause I'm like

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
so you shoot kids is what you're saying here on the show

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
I'm shooting kids playing the game

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
Loki is the

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
Loki is the enforcement to keep kids out of

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
Grand Theft Auto if he sees a child

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
playing Grand Theft Auto he will shoot them

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
but you can you can

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
you can do all sorts of things you can buy property

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
in the game and garages and

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
you can customize your cars and the way you look

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
and it just it's

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
kind of fun it's just this whole leveling up

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
system and stuff and you level up your stats

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
based on what you're doing in the game

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
so

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
I don't know I'm enjoying it I've been playing both on

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
PS3 and 360

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
the PS3 I'm on level 12 cause

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
I've been playing that mostly because my co-workers

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
say oh yeah I get the PS3 version we're gonna

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
be totally on there playing PS3 yeah

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
not a single one of them on PS3

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
so I may go back to 360 again

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
and level up my character there but

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
you know we have the

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
crew it's open we've got our

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
fun little logo there and stuff so

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
Rockstar Social Club look for crews look for

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
VoG Network and you can sign up

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
and come play with us I

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
guess there you go all right

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
well moving on to my gaming week I'll

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
go last and honestly there wasn't a lot to

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
it I have really just been playing Final Fantasy

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
14 this entire week just like

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
Logan's been playing Grand Theft Auto Online I've

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
pretty much only been playing Final Fantasy 14

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
I'm in the end game now I'm a level 50 white

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
mage and I'm kind of doing the stuff that you do at

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
end game which is running

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
you know CM and AK

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
and Praetorium and all that

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
to get my seal or my

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
I keep saying seals but they're tomes

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
actually and that's really mostly what I've

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
been doing I gotta say though I was really impressed

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
with the ending I'm using my

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
quotey fingers because you know it's an MMO it doesn't really

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
end but Final Fantasy 14 has

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
a pretty definitive

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
story from start to finish and when

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
you finish the actual story you get like

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
this 25 minute ending and I gotta

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
say I was happy with

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
it and it's simple

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
but it's effective like for somebody

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
that's really invested a lot of time in the game

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
I was like I really get the sense

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
that I accomplished something

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
and now I see what's next for my character

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
and that's such a great feeling playing an MMO

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
which usually doesn't

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
ever end

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
so yeah that's really all I can say

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
I can't really talk about a lot of other games I will

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
say I did pick

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
up a new toy the other day I did

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
pick up a new HD

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
game capture card or I should

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
say more like a box it's more a box it's like

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
a USB connected thing and I am really

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
excited because I purposely wanted to get

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
something that would do the new consoles through HDMI

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
and this does the old

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
consoles because the

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
component doubles as a composite

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
plugin so I am really excited

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
to stream a variety

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
of stuff as soon as I can get it working with my

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
laptop and all that so

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
that's something in the future

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
in the coming weeks so I

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
will be able to diversify things

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
a little more than just playing the same MMO all week

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
long I'm going to force myself to do that

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
I've been very busy with personal life

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
stuff Rocky Horror which I'm

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
directing is this coming

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
Saturday so as you can imagine I'm

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
super busy with that I wouldn't know anything about playing

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
all games to the exception

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
of all else

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
and how many hours have you spent on Mass Effect?

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
shut up 3 digits or 4 now

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
alright

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
alrighty that's enough

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
for our gaming weeks quickly some

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
housekeeping actually

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
I actually have things for housekeeping tonight

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
I want to plug another podcast I was on today

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
and thank them for having me check out

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
the Let's Wow podcast

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
that is World of Warcraft

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
so yes I still dabble in World of Warcraft even though

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
I've talked about a lot of Final Fantasy 14

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
lately but I did guest on their show tonight

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
that's episode number 31

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
and you can check that out that will be in their archive soon

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
available on iTunes and Stitcher

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
and all that again that's the Let's Wow podcast

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
thank you kids for having me on and we talked about

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
World of Warcraft and other MMOs

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
and I razzed my good buddy

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
Gemet for a good 500

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
minutes

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
let's see other things I want to plug

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
it is that time of year again

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
where a lot of podcasts

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
are going to be asking you to vote for them

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
in the podcast awards

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
which is right now kind of what we have

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
in the little podcast industry to recognize

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
the podcast media

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
sometimes

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
I'm a little iffy on how I feel

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
with it all being kind of a popularity

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
contest at the end of the day but

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
I will say being able to

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
be nominated for it and

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
collect the votes and stuff is

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
really good promotion for us

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
and it's always really

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
nice to be able to

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
kind of share in that with other

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
gaming podcasts that really

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
work hard for what they do so I hope we

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
will get that honor again this year

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
to be in the podcast awards but if we

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
aren't we're still going to do what we do

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
here every Sunday night regardless but I

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
would encourage you podcastawards.com

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
other categories as well and

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
if you feel that some other podcast is

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
more deserving of a nomination than us then that's cool

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
we're good just

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
you know support your favorite show

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
no matter who it may be

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
alright I

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
think that's it for housekeeping Twitter

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
twitter.com slash olr and Facebook

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
facebook.com slash orange lounge radio

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
alright now we can have

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
ourselves some gaming news

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
so Loki let's get on to

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
some gaming news

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
alright so let's talk a little bit about

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
the Xbox One

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
it was

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
I guess put out there this

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
last week that it's going to take

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
about 15 to 20 minutes to download

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
the Xbox One day one patch

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
so expect a short delay before

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
you get into your gaming

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
which if I remember

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
quickly I believe that is a lot

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
less of a wait than

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
you had to for the Wii U

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
wasn't that Wii U

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
day one patch like

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
an hour or something? well that's because

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
Nintendo's download servers are slow

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
as hell like I don't know

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
well I think they've gotten a lot better

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
but remember all the crazy Nintendo

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
fanboys were all hammering that thing at the same time

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
I mean not that it excuses it but

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
it's the reason why it was downloading slow

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
alright

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
and then I was going to talk real quick

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
because I actually had noticed this and I posted

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
it on Twitter earlier this week

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
about the

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
next gen digital file

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
sizes holy shit

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
so there's

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
some new SKUs that are coming out for a bunch of

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
different things and I don't know why

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
I guess they're just trying to get people to

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
buy in on this stuff but like NBA2K

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
14 they have a super

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
fan pack and also for

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
Call of Duty Ghost they have

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
an Xbox edition

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
and what these two

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
things are is they're digital

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
they're retail items that are digital

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
that you go to the store and buy

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
this packaging and it comes with codes for both the

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
Xbox 360 version and the

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
Xbox One version or in the case

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
of NBA2K the Xbox

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
360, Xbox One version or

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4 version

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
the fine print though tells you how big

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
those files are like how

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
much hard drive space you need so

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
it's not a big surprise that the current gen stuff

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
is anywhere from 8 to 10 gigs

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
the next gen stuff and this is

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
kind of like you know imagine if they

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
went that way where they were trying to really push digital

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
60 gigabytes

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
60

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
that's a long fucking time

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
to download that I mean that is a good

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
like even on my good internet connection

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
about 15 hours

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
that's a lot of HD stuff

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
and I mean

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
isn't it still out there these caps

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
on bandwidth that people get in a month

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
I think there might be some I think Comcast

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
suspended theirs for a little while and they were going to

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
up it to 300 gigs but still

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
imagine Comcast up their thing to 300 gigs

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
that's like six games in a month

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
which I guess that is a lot but

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
I mean and then nothing else on your internet

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
so let's be real it's still

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
I mean that's a long time to wait for something

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
digitally and yeah I understand that they do

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
have the technology where that they can start

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
streaming the game after a certain

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
amount of it's downloaded but shit

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
even if it's half of it that's still eight hours

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
that you have to wait before you can start playing

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
that game and

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
if that's something that you're planning on buying

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
at launch you know you

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
might as well just buy

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
the disc I mean cause really the

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
cost savings of it isn't very

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
significant cause basically this

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
pack is like 100 bucks if you get the two

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
games so you're really only saving like

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
20 bucks maybe you know

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
the fact that you're basically pre-ordering

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
this you know quite in advance and you have

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
to buy digital copies for both so you can't actually

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
trade them in whereas some of these places

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
I'm sure will allow you to trade in like say your

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
NBA 2K copy on

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
360 get you know maybe 40

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
bucks back or something like that you know

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
it's not that far out and

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
you know buy the next gen version for

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
20 bucks or something I still

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
think it'd be cheaper than having

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
the download all that shit I mean that's just

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
that's ridiculous and especially

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
since they're trying to push that it

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
one of the reasons

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
why the you know their big

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
ideas of making this all digital world is just

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
not feasible right now with

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
our internet infrastructure

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
it's just not gonna work

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
so that's it

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
well what do you think though if the console life cycle

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
is like 10 years or whatever do you

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
think that maybe in that amount of time

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
we will be at that point?

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
Possibly I mean it's gonna take some sort of

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
I think government funding

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
to kind of

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
put you know

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
I guess get these companies

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
to want to improve their infrastructure

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
cause right now a lot of these companies have

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
monopolies in the different areas and so

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
there's really no

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
no need for them to try to get their

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
internet speeds faster just like you know with

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
Comcast I was trying to get this one plan

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
that they had that was 70 bucks

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
cause I pay about 60, 70 dollars

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
right now for just internet it's in a

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
different area where it's double the internet speed that

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
I have now plus cable

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
for the same price and

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
of course

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
oh I'm sorry that plan's not in our area

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
of course

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
it's just that's the problem

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
there's monopolies everywhere so you're not gonna

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
they're not gonna be in a big hurry to

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
offer faster internet

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
without some sort of government funding because

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
why bother spending the money

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
to upgrade our service when we can just charge more

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
and you know keep the same level

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
of service or decline it

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
alright well one thing people

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
were using their bandwidth for this week was

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
to watch the latest Nintendo Direct

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
you know Nintendo likes to do these where

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
they just take the news they take their case straight to

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
their hardcore fan base and

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
it's been working for better or worse for them

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
they unveiled the latest

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
Nintendo Direct on October 1st which kind

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
of ran down here's where Nintendo's at for the

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
end of the year one big

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
shocker maybe not I don't know

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
depending on what you think of these things there was

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
a delay Donkey Kong Country Tropical

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
Freeze moving to

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
2014 it will not make the holiday

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
season this was one of their big holiday

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
things they were hyping but unfortunately

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
Donkey Kong Country did move

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
to February 2014 is

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
when this game is coming out

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
I'm gonna go out on a limb

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
and say that this is strategy

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
that I don't know if this was necessarily

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
because the game's not done

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
but this was maybe to buff up

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
2014

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
next or this coming winter

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
where things didn't work out

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
so well in 2013 I think you're right

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
because they had too much stuff coming out and

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
there's the fourth quarter there's too much stuff coming out

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
Nintendo themselves they have We Fit

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
You in the beginning of November

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
and then they have Super Mario 3D

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
World coming out at the end of November

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
and this was originally gonna be like

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
a couple weeks later in the early part

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
of December right and I think

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
this could also mean and I'm definitely

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
tinfoil hatting here a bit so don't you know

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
take what I say with a grain of salt here but

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
this could mean that Mario Kart 8 is

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
bumped back a little bit because what Mario Kart 8

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
they had said March before right?

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
I'm thinking

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
I'm thinking more like April at this

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
point and maybe there's something happening there

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
where they want to strategically spread

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
out the first party releases plus

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
I don't think there are a lot of releases

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
on the Wii U right now we're running

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
in the same situation we did last year

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
where there was nothing coming out for a few months

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
and I think that's what we're gonna see now

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
I definitely know there's nothing

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
coming out in December and there's nothing

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
coming out right now in

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
January. Well how does Xbox One and PlayStation

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
4 look for next year in the winter?

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
I mean aren't they gonna be the ones that are kinda

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
hurting for games in the winter? I think that

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
they're gonna run I think everyone's gonna run in the same

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
situation but right now we don't have a firm

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
lineup for what we have for you know

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
the first quarter of the year

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
so it's still

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
they haven't really announced that stuff you know probably

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
later on into

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
the fourth quarter we'll know that because

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
you know right now their focus is on the

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
fourth quarter so I don't think anything's gonna

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
get delayed to the you know

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
beginning part of the year but they still haven't made their announcements

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
of what titles they have coming like you know

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
EA hasn't announced what they really have coming aside

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
from you know

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
was it

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
yeah but EA's not a factor on Wii U either

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
true yeah very true

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
unfortunately

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
I know but even like other companies like there's

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
just no big titles have been announced

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
yeah at least not a lot of titles for

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
February well what up G says Titanfall

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
is next spring right I guess that's a big one

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
I think that's more summer I don't think that's

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
coming out in spring at all you think Destiny's gonna be that

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
same time frame too I know that's a big one I think Destiny's yeah

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
maybe fourth quarter that it's

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
second half of the or at least second quarter I think

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
fair enough going to our chat room at

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
live.vognetwork.com

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
SHJ100Matt says further proves that their whole

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
E3 conference video just showed

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
2014 games

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
CaptainSpike says absolutely gutted

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
about Donkey Kong one of my most anticipated

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
games of 2013

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
well at least you're

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
still getting a solid platformer in the form

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
of Super Mario 3D World which

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
some of the early previews are coming back very

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
positive which is no surprise at all

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
I mean you know a lot of the Mario

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
games are very strong performers I can't

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
think I what was the last one that people

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
didn't like Sunshine

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
that was a while ago Hotel Mario

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
what's that Hotel Mario

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
Hotel that's a long time ago hey Sunshine was fun

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
yeah Sunshine still has its

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
defenders I like Sunshine actually

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
myself so

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
I mean most Mario platformers aren't bad

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
they just aren't I mean there's been some

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
that are like that's okay but

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
some most of them are very very good

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
so

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
that's at least you got a solid

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
platformer in that to look forward to

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
in November now in Japan and Europe

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
Sonic will be

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
coming to Super Smash Brothers

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
whatever they call it which well

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
I was I see you rolling your eyes over there Loki

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
I was actually a little surprised because of the fact

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
it's a third party character I didn't think they'd

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
recycle those but I guess

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
cause Nintendo's not publishing

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
Mario and Sonic at the Olympics

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
I guess

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
this is not surprising at all

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
that's about surprising oh hey Luigi's in this

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
game oh alright

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
fair enough more surprising they said he wasn't in the game

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
next up character

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
Scarlet Witch

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
let's hope

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
let's see and

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
Pikmin 3 is getting DLC

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
Nintendo's kind of further going down

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
the DLC spiral with

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
Pikmin 3 DLC but a lot of people looking

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
forward to it and you know I gotta say the Super

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
Luigi U was

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
pretty good so I mean if Nintendo

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
can keep making robust DLC packages

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
like that this isn't a bad thing at all

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
also some folks very excited

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
I'm sure Act Deft was screaming

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
shaking crying and convulsing

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
over the fact that there is a new Kirby

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
game on its way to the 3DS

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
as if the 3DS

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
needed more powerhouse games but here's

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
another one Kirby's on its way

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
and Loki's going yup yup that's what I was

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
saying like you know all these announcements like wow

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
more great titles for the 3DS and then like

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
but when people are like Nintendo's

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
dying Nintendo's gonna go under

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
it's like the 3DS

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
is like

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
da bomb right now like you can't

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
I mean yes the 3DS in the

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
beginning little shaky but now

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
you've got it like if you play

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
handheld games at all the 3DS

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
we've already established on the 3DS

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
for 3D anymore and now we have two

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
screens one that's HD one that's a touch

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
screen just fucking put it on the Wii U

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
already god dammit it's gonna happen

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
eventually it's just

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
make that announcement and then done then you don't have to worry

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
about content because you have a ton of fucking

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
games already on the 3DS

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
that could be on the Wii U

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
alright I don't understand it a game I am

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
very excited about also on the 3DS

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
speaking of powerhouse games I can't think of

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
anything for me more a powerhouse than

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
Zelda A Link Between Worlds

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
which is coming out November 22nd

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
this is the spiritual successor of

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
sorts to Link to the Past from Super

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
Nintendo which holds a place near and dear

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
in my heart and I'm sure many of you out there

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
one thing they announced about the game that's

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
very interesting the dungeons can be played

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
in any order

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
which is not common

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
for the Zelda games usually without

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
certain items you can't get to places but like

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
in the early like the first Zelda

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
game you could run into level

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
you know some of the later levels

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
if you had a bomb you could probably go all the way

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
to level 9 right at the beginning right

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
you might need a ladder some of us have made the mistake

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
of doing that the first time we found it by accident

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
and went what the hell dead

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
so I would imagine there's

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
still gonna be an optimal order just like

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
in any Mega Man game or something but

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
the cool thing is it'll kinda open it up

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
for the speed runners and people

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
that like to bend the rules a little bit to

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
try different patterns so that'll be pretty cool

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
yeah I'm just looking forward to it

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
you know being just a smash hit and

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
quieting the people who will not

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
shut up about Ocarina

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
of Time slash Majora's Mask

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
look guys we all love those games

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
they're not the only Zelda games come on

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
thank you will you give me a

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
fist bump for that statement thank you very much

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
thank you like I you know

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
I understand those games Ocarina

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
and they have their place but

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
for me Link to the Past oh my gosh

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
I give a clump just thinking about how great that

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
game is I've got a gold cart

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
Ocarina of Time I agree with you

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
fair enough

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
alright I knew I liked having you on the show

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
alright so that is out of course

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
November 22nd and lastly I'll mention this

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
the 3DS StreetPass system

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
the relay points

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
that they instituted recently like at Starbucks

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
where you can actually street pass people

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
at Starbucks because what happens is that

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
when you go there

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
whoever was last there their data is

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
on the little machine waiting for you

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
to get it on your 3DS well they're gonna

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
upgrade these relay points six

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
people now will be on these

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
things so if you go to Starbucks you can get up to six

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
people on these things that's even better

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
because I mean I actually do go to the

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
like there's this one that Becky and I

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
go to like at least twice a week

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
yeah I know that's great that's awesome news

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
and some content distribution

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
events are planned for use

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
over the relay so

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
interesting

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
very cool stuff I guess it'll push demos

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
through to your 3DS if you opt in for it

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
so that'll be really cool

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
Dark Soccer I think you have more Nintendo

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
stuff for us right? But I'm putting my

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
island up yes I do have other news

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
thank you ActDeft because I've

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
really been wanting an island for a while

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
well how about

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
the new Wii U

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
firmware is also going to have a bunch

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
of other features now it's gonna be

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
700 megabytes so

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
it's gonna take a while to download

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
but it has internet browser

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
updates it has

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
more demos and trial

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
software USB keyboard support

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
Dolby Pro Logic 2

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
smartphones will be able

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
to connect to the

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
Nintendo network ID

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
you can view a friends list from the Wii U menu

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
you have your headset

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
that can hook to the gamepad and be used

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
for chat and you can read

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
PDF files on the Wii U

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
and you can also save your passwords

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
for websites so

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
lots of stuff

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
you also have to accept a new license agreement

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
I'm telling you this because I just updated

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
my Wii U not that long ago

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
I also want to put this PSA out there

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
those Wii U updates can take a little while

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
especially because it was what like 700 megabytes

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
that's what I was saying

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
so put on a movie

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
call your mom

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
my point is don't wait until

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
the day Mario 3D

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
comes out to do this

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
like if you're listening to my voice

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
and you haven't done this yet you probably just want to go turn

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
that guy on right now and just let the update be over

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
and done with and then be ready for

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
Zelda Wind Waker HD or whatever the next game

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
is you're going to get

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
or get up in the morning have an update and call your mom

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
or whichever relative

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
you have living right now

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
fair enough, fair enough

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
talk to them

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
and go outside and get some fresh air

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
get a job, wait I need to get a job

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
alright Loki

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
alright

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
so let's see here let's talk a little bit about

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
PlayStation 3 getting its own

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
firmware update as well

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
4.5 finally came out

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
and what it does is adds the

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
auto downloads

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
to people that are not in

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
PlayStation Plus so you'll be able to

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
also transfer data between your

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
PlayStation 3 and Vita versus

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
via Wi-Fi

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
and ethernet connections I guess

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
originally you could only do it through the transfer cable that they had

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
and

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
also lets you

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
set up I guess groups

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
of players that can

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
see your trophies so you can

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
either have that open to everybody I don't know why you wouldn't

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
why you would hide your trophies from

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
people unless there was like a trophy

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
for going to the strip club a lot of times

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
and Grand Theft Auto 5 or something you know I don't

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
know well

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
remember when I was getting

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
all those achievements in Dance Dance Revolution

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
Universe because I had it like the day it came out

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
and I started playing it right away and I got a

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
message from what was his name

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
that guy who had all the achievements

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
he ended up getting banned from Xbox

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
because it turns out they were a strip club DJ

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
that was his name he sent me a message like

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
how are getting the achievements in that game

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
what's the difficulty like

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
like I don't even know how he found me I think he used one of

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
those like websites that shows you like

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
who's doing well in achievements and I think

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
at that moment in time I had more

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
achievement points in that game than anyone else

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
I mean like on release day so

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
maybe if I'm in that situation

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
and again I want to hide trophies

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
oh it just occurred to me

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
if I'm reviewing games

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
people might ask me to turn that feature on

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
to not spoil because a lot of the trophy lists

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
leak from review copies

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
so maybe that's to encourage

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
critics and so forth to not leak it

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
I bet that would be one

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
anyways they have it

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
so

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
cool but yeah so basically

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
so the auto download is kind of cool

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
about time everybody gets that

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
here's the thing okay and this isn't really a playstation

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
but like you know speaking of

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
system updates and stuff fucking 360

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
man every time I log in live

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
now I'm still getting that fucking prompt

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
to add a second like

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
a second method to confirm my passwords

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
or stuff if I need to

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
you know like a second way they can contact

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
me basically and I've filled it out

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
a bunch of times

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
and I've even filled it out either via

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
you know texting via email

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
and it still fucking says oh

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
sorry you only have one form to

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
contact you are you okay with this

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
I'm like yes I'm okay with this nope sorry

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
you need to please add another

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
way to contact us that's weird and I even did it through

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
the website they have a special website you go

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
to to confirm that because obviously it says

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
oh yeah you can go ahead and

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
add it through this oh I'm sorry actually no you can't

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
add it through this you have to go onto this

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
website to do it and I did that and

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
it confirmed it and it still

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
fucking doesn't work and I get prompted every

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
fucking time I log in you need to call Microsoft or something

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
it's not like something's wrong fucking flip

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
them off is what I need to do aren't

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
you kind of doing that right now

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
because Microsoft executives

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
right now and their tech supporter

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
listening to the show and going oh

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
no one customer is having a problem

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
well I'm a

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
customer that has a podcast

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
fear me he's a loud

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
ass customer let's be real dark

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
sakura so are you

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
everyone has a voice that's right

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
and we use our voice to say fuck you

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
alright

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
speaking of like consoles

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
and things one console will be going

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
away rest in peace

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
bye it's

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
Nintendo's Wii believe it or not Nintendo's

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
Wii will be ending production

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
soon in Japan

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
so we don't have any

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
worry about you know the US or other

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
territories Canada Europe we don't know but

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
in Japan let's be

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
real the Wii isn't selling so hot anymore

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
985

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
Wii units were sold in a week which

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
really isn't a lot so the Wii is going

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
to be fading to black and

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
it kind of makes sense for Nintendo like

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
you know push the Wii U make people buy

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
that to play the games make

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
sense for them so yep they'll be

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
sunsetting the Wii and I

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
I wouldn't I would bet that maybe

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
trying to push the Wii U a little harder

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
especially in a year where

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
in Japan there's no competition

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
isn't exactly a bad

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
move so

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
nice knowing you Wii

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
good not to have yourself as competition

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
right because well in a way

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
that's what Nintendo would have right now in Japan

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
if you think about it in terms of production

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
cost making a machine that no one's buying

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
then yeah

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
there's no need to keep putting the production

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
money into it when you could be

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
using it for Wii U I mean what is going to be

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
on the shelves in Japan there's Wii U

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
now there's not a Wii there's 360

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
but in Japan that's not

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
a factor sorry and the PlayStation 3

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
you know so it's literally gonna be

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
do you want the new system or the old system

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
that's the way it is in Japan right now

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
it'll be interesting

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
so of course handhelds

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
it's a whole nother Oprah because they

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
are making a push with the Vita in Japan

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
big time we talked about that already last week

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
alright one more story and then we'll travel

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
around the world and check out release dates Stark Sakura

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
I was giving you back your

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
power supply rod thank you for bringing back what you

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
borrow yes because I'm always

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
good that way well here is

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
something that how long have you had some of my

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
games

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
what you mean

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
that I've actually played

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
I'm just gonna be

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
playing games okay

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
so well this should interest

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
you you like SimCity

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
don't you I like the old SimCity

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
I like the first SimCity game

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
I like SimCity action news on the

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
CD-ROM remember that do I have

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
to go get those YouTubes because I will

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
ah there's a big mine

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
no

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
they should make me a voice actor

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
well Maxis is

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
considering an offline mode for SimCity

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
the note

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
was put on the state of SimCity

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
blog where the Emeryville

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
manager Patrick Beutcher

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
I guess is saying

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
that they are considering

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
an offline mode apparently since a lot

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
of people yes

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
Alan I will check out your Saturn

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
um since

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
a lot of people have been complaining

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
that it is specifically on

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
the quote says right now we

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
have a team specifically focused on

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
exploring the possibility of an offline mode

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
I can't make any promises on when we

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
will have more information but we know this is

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
something that many of our players have been asking for

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
so

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
who knows maybe it'll be sooner rather than

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
later I'm interested

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
I don't have the game

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
yet but I'm interested in offline mode

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
here's my concern because

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
SimCity is starting to come down in price a little bit

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
I have a feeling that

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
they'll do it as part of an expansion

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
or something to get you to spend the full 60

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
bucks which

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
I mean whatever I would consider

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
still spending it on an offline SimCity

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
that doesn't require Origin

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
but we'll see

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
yeah

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
well I honestly

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
and just on the same note

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
I wish that there would be

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
updates across the board for all of them so you don't

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
have to use Origin but that's me

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
and everybody else that plays

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
Mass Effect 3

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
alright traveling around the world

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
and checking out some release dates things that

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
will be coming a little sooner than

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
it's new because

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
you can take the top part of the character

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
and put it on the bottom part of another character

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
woooo

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
innovation

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
and jumping you can jump now

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
woooo

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
sell me a thousand copies already

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
it will sell

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
much more than a thousand copies

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
uh yes so

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
hey you know my 5 year old nephew is nuts

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
about that game so

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
5 year old nephew checked out Disney Infinity

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
as well? I have permanently

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
disbarred him from anything Disney related online

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
so no

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
wow this sounds like a story

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
I also want to mention

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
that also on Saturday

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
they coincide with the Pokemon

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
X and Y on the 3DS

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
you can buy a 2DS

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
one less

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
DS in there

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
if 3D is too much for you

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
if the 3D will blow your mind

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
the 2D will just kind of simmer your mind

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
I am hearing, take it with a grain of salt

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
but I am hearing that the 2DS

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
a lot of people kind of like the way it feels

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
when they play it for what it's worth

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
I mean despite the fact that

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
a lot of people have been very critical about the design

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
how it doesn't fold the same way and so forth

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
hearing a lot of positive feedback about

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
how it feels when it's in your hands

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
I'd like to mention though

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
even though I do happen to peruse

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
the Evil G website for some release dates

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
sometimes I am kind of

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
confused at why they're selling

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
GoPro accessories for

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
Gamestop

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
I don't know

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
I don't know

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
Moving on to Japan and checking out

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
the releases over there on the Playstation 3

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
on October 10th

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
the Batman Arkham Twin Pack which came out here

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
just last week I think

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
comes out in Japan

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
it's called the best series

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
also coming out in Japan on the 10th

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
F1 2013

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
Grand Theft Auto 5's Japanese release

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
Mina no Golf 6

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
gets a best release

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
a price reduction

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
Sakatsuku Pro Soccer Club

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
comes out from Sega

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
and Tales of Symphonia

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
the Unisonant pack comes out

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
there's like a regular

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
there's a Famitsu Deluxe pack

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
and there's a Lalabit Market

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
limited edition pack

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
so there's all that if you're Tales of Symphonia

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
looking forward to that

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
also worth mentioning a game called Fairy Fencer F

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
comes out from Compile

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
in a regular and limited edition

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
Fairy Fencer

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
is that like fencing?

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
you put them on a spike

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
and then you fence

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
each other with dead fairies

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
that would be awesome

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
they're not Navi fairies

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
they're like

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
they're like carrying

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
pole arms

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
she's fighting a grizzly bear

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
and yes of course she's wearing a short skirt

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
and you can pretty much

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
see her hoo-ha hanging out

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
by fairies do you mean Vocaloids?

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
because that's what they look more like

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
I think it might be I'm not sure

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
but Fairy Fencing

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
they're fencing your face off

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
basically if you're that grizzly bear

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
I'm a fenced

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
alright

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
let's see what's coming out on other systems in Japan

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
this week

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
moving on over to the Xbox 360

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
ha ha I know but there are still things

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
coming out including Grand Theft Auto 5

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
F1 2013

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
the Batman Arkham pack

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
and there's an Xbox Live 12 month

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
2 gold membership card that comes with

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
Grand Theft Auto 5

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
I don't really know what that means but that is something that is happening in Japan

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
they probably had something similar here

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
I just missed it

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
on the Playstation Vita this week Dream Club Zero Portable

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
gets a price reduction

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
a new game called Getsuigakuen

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
cool comes out this week

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
wait wait what?

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
Getsuigakuen Co

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
comes out this week

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
can I see what that looks like?

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
you sure can

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
this is the one screenshot I have

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
unless this other

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
let me check out this other page

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
might have more

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
fantastic radio here we have

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
that just shows what it comes with

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
I want to see what the limited edition comes with

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
I thought I've heard of it before

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
but I don't remember off hand

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
aha it looks like they get the game

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
a book, maybe a school book

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
a music CD

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
and trading cards?

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
that's a drama CD

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
no

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
the CD is

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
basically like a play

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
like radio drama

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
so maybe this is based off some type of

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
drama series

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
alright also on the Playstation Vita

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
Metal Gear Solid HD edition

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
getting a price reduction

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
and I think some new Vita

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
equipment comes out this week

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
is this the week of the Vita Slim model?

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
it is, so this is the week where

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
your black, khaki black, light blue white

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
lime green white, pink black

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
white and black slim models

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
all come out, so no wonder

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
there's so much on the Vita this week

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
oh my gosh there's Slaughter Mania 5

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
like slaughter, like slot machines

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
not like I'm gonna go kill a bunch of zombies

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
Slaughter Mania

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
Uncharted Golden Abyss gets a re-release

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
in the best hits

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
Soul Sacrifice gets a re-release

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
and then Sakatsuku Pro Soccer Club

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
Osukuru

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
comes out this week also

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
so lots of stuff going on on the Vita this week

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
now that makes sense

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
now that I see that the

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
Vita Slim is out this week

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
so I'm sure there will be some people here for that

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
on the Wii U, sadly nothing to report this week

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
but Rayman Legends coming up next week

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
you got a little time

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
and on the Nintendo 3DS this week

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
Pokemon X and Y is also

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
on Japan, it's like a worldwide release

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
also a big release for them

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
on the 12th and

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
there's all sorts of accessories

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
you can get

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
Froki pens

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
you can get

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
Chesapeake pouches

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
and

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
Lord knows what else, there you go

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
all that coming out in Japan

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
this week on the 3DS

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
Dark Sakura?

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
Well we have a pretty

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
slender selection for the UK

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
on the 9th there's Montague's Mount

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
for PC

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
and

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
on the 11th we have

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
Beyond 2 Souls for PS3

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
that's about it

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
alright just a couple more news stories for you guys

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
and then the classic game of the week

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
and it will surprise no one

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
Loki?

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
alright

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
so let's see here

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
SNK

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
they are getting rid of

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
the Neo Geo X, you may remember

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
the Neo Geo X is kind of that

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
rebuild I guess of the

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
classic Neo Geo

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
they also had this

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
portable system that was

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
plugged into this dock

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
it was kind of emulating everything

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
but

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
now they have cease and desist

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
against the website that sells the Neo Geo X

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
I guess they were saying

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
that the notice which

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
appeared on October 2nd

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
demands an immediate cease and desist

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
of manufacturing, distribution, promotion

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
and selling of the Neo Geo X

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
gold limited edition mega pack

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
volume 1 and classic volumes 1 through 5

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
as well as the Neo Geo X

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
arcade stick in order to

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
protect our intellectual property rights

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
such as Neo Geo and SNK

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
see here I thought

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
me being naive I guess that

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
they had the go ahead to go ahead and make that stuff

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
since they had SNK on it

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
and it was a fucking Neo Geo

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
I mean at least it looked like one

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
come to find out they didn't

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
they just kind of put it out there anyways

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
wow, it's been out for a while too

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
I was going to say I forgot the thing even came out

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
how horrible is that

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
but I mean they've recycled those Neo Geo games

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
like a ton of them are available on

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
Virtual Console and Playstation 3

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
download I mean

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
if you want something a little more authentic

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
I guess you could get this but

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
keep in mind those licensed ones

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
SNK gets money for

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
true, they would get no money

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
if they didn't

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
provide their license

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
ok, here's what it is, I get it now

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
I guess it was licensed

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
because Tomo was the one that was putting it out

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
they do a lot of license, weird shit

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
but now they're ending

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
their license agreement so

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
it's no longer going to be sold after the 2nd

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
wow, the 2nd of October?

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
well then it's done

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
it's done, yes, so

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
kind of makes me wonder

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
it sounds very like

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
not like we've decided

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000
to, you know, end our

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
licensing agreement with Tomo, we're just not going to

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
produce anymore, it's like please be informed that

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
our company is

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
or the licensing agreement is

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
terminated as of October 2nd

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
so what happens to all these unsold consoles

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000
they go in a landfill in New Mexico?

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
no, they still get sold, they just can't produce anymore

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
oh, well that's good

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
go get them now

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
if they're sitting on some then yeah

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
I don't think they can sell them

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
they don't have an agreement to do so anymore

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
if there's some out there in a while

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
there's something they can do about that

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000
this will be a collector's item very soon

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
no company for ET down there

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
I'll still

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
stick with my Neo Geo

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
you got the real thing though, why even bother

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
with this stuff if you have the real thing

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
because it has the games loaded on the system

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
you know how much I paid for the last cartridge

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
I bought?

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
we paid $300 for

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
what was the last one we got?

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
King of Fighters 2000

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
when I had money

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
blows me away how much those cartridges cost

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
the 48 in 1's

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
there's a ton of them on one cartridge

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000
Bobby knows

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
alright

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
one more story about Terraria

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
which is a hardcore fan

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
I saw Terraria on

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
Playstation 3 this weekend

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
I was at Fry's randomly when I got the

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
capture box

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
and I didn't realize because it comes with

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
all that extra stuff, it has a neat little box

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
that it comes in with the drive and everything

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
so I was kind of looking at that going

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
oh neat

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
I personally way preferred Minecraft

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
to Terraria but I know Terraria

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
definitely has its fans, people love the

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
retroness and the 2D that Terraria has

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
and so the good news is Terraria 2

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
it's a thing that's happening

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
Andrew Spinks the creator of Terraria

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
talked about Terraria 2

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
saying it is definitely something

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
that will be happening but contrary

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
to several of the articles that went live today

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
I have not started development

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
I have a list of features and mechanics

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
I want the game to have but that is the

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
extent of the development at this point

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
so in other words, he's going to do it

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
it's announced in that regard

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
but that's it, we don't have anything else

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
so don't plan on this happening anytime

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
soon

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
let's see, also in the interview

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
mentioned that version 1.2

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000
will be the last

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
7 month update for the original game

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
but that he will change the end game

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
up for the update within the next month

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
or two because there was no final

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000
boss and there may be some other

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
smaller updates a few more months down the line

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
he might hire a team to

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
do some updates but he'll be

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
focusing on Terraria 2 soon

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000
so there you go

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
Darkstalker, you played a little bit of Terraria right?

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
Yeah, you gave me a copy

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
Yeah, I remember that, I bought like a 4 pack

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
It was interesting

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
I don't think I could quite get into it very well

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
but it was interesting, it amused

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
It amused me for an hour

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
Thank you for amusing me for an hour, Rob

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
You're welcome

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
Alright, well let's talk about a game that has amused Darkstalker

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
for a hell of a lot longer than an hour

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000
and it amused her earlier today

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000
when she picked it

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000
as the classic game of the week

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000
because every week Darkstalker dives into the gaming vault

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
and pulls out a game 10 years or older

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
and says

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000
Hey!

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000
Respect this game and play it now

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
Dust it off

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000
Darkstalker, you better play bitch

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000
You better play

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
Darkstalker

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000
What is the classic game of the week?

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000
The game is

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000
Animal Crossing

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
AKA Dobutsu no Mori

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000
Animal Forest

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000
It is a life sim game

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000
and I miss this music, Rob

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000
The old school music

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
Wasn't it good?

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000
It was good

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
I was actually running around the house

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
making up lyrics to this to Midna

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
because she was looking at me like I was insane

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
She probably does that a lot, I bet

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000
Shut up

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
So anyway

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
and of course the one that I linked on here

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
is actually the Nintendo 64 one

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
which was the very first Dobutsu no Mori

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
It came out in Japan on April 14, 2001

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000
and came out on the GameCube as

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
Animal Forest Plus

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
in

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
the next December

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
so that was in 2002

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000
and then came out in other countries

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
as Animal Crossing

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
and like I had mentioned earlier

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000
in the show, because we got

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
so much more stuff over here

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000
they released a new version that was called

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000
Animal Forest E Plus

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
which actually has characters in that one

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.000
that are in no other versions

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000
of the game

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000
If you want to read more about them, look on the wiki

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000
There's a really, really good

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000
Animal Crossing wiki

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000
So the game itself

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000
is

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000
No, Bobby, I'm not doing Halo

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000
So the game itself

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
has evolved over time

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000
but I'm going to focus on the

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000
GameCube one since that is

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000
probably the one

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000
the majority of us have started with

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000
So with the very first

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
game, and it was

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.000
like this on the Nintendo 64 as well

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000
you would

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.000
arrive in town

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000
homeless

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000
penniless and get forced into

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000
indentured servitude by the

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
evil Tom Nook

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000
who is the mobster

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000
boss of your town

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000
it's in all

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000
reality, you know, it's a very

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000
open-ended game, it keeps going, you have

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000
different holidays in town

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000
you have to, you know, earn money

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
and pay off your mortgage

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000
and you can expand your house

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000
people were there

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000
to collect NES games

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000
that's what they were there for

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
sorry, I can't contain myself

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
so anyway

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000
you have to

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000
you know

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000
you earn Bells, which is the in-game currency

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
you pay off your loan

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000
and in the

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000
and you hit villagers with bug nets

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000
you know, I keep hitting that fucker Ed

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000
with a bug net and he won't move

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000
I'm not the only one having to

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000
deal with Ed by the way

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000
so, he's a dumb horse

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000
so anyway, you also could

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000
collect Nintendo

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
Entertainment games

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000
and as far as I'm aware

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000
I think this just popped up

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000
in

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000
I want to say just in the

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000
GameCube ones

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
you basically

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
you could get, you know, Ice Climber

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000
and Mario Brothers

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000
those were available via

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000
eReader

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
there were all kinds of

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000
they also said that The Legend of Zelda

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
was in the game, but they had no means

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000
of obtaining it

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000
I think it was supposed to be like a prize or something

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000
so yeah

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000
there were different multiplayer modes as well

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000
where you could

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000
have up to four people living

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
in the village

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
you couldn't play at the

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
same time as anybody else, but you could take turns

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
like, Dan and I would see

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000
who could pay off our mortgage faster

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
and who got the gold statue and who got the silver statue

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000
and finally I'm like, bitch make your own town

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000
so he has Danville

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000
that was his town

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000
you also

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000
can

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000
ship items from one to another

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000
via codes

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000
and you can say, hey

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000
milk you asshole, send this to Rob

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000
and Fetch, which is your town now

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000
isn't it? What was your old town?

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000
Rob is...

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000
sorry I was eating

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000
my old town was

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000
I think it was like Robville or something silly

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000
yeah, well Dan had Danville because Danville

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000
exists

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000
you could also leave messages to each other

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.000
on the big board

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000
that's in the center of town

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000
and I still do that when I visit people's

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000
towns as I'll say, hey Jamie was here

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000
so and so sucks

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000
steal Ed from me, still trying to steal Kabuki from you

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.000
now this I wanted to play a little bit

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000
do you hear how the voice sounds?

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000
now

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000
in the Japanese version

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000
basically they are

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000
they say every syllable

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000
every kana

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000
so you can actually, I mean it's really

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000
sped up and fast, but you can actually kind of

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000
pick out what they're saying

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000
for the American, for the English versions

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000
basically they say each letter

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
so it really does sound like a bunch of gibberish

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000
and the voices of course

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000
went a little bit differently because they had to

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000
redo them to say each of the letters

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
you had another thing

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000
that was only in the earlier ones

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000
and that was

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000
Mr. Resetti or as he was

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000
called in Japan, I think he was Resetsan

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
so

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000
if you turned off your game without saving

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000
the next time you turned it on, he'd pop out of the ground

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000
and berate you for like an hour

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000
so basically he annoyed you into not doing it again

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
you um

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000
now the part that's showing on the video right now

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000
if you can kind of hear some of it

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
is where you talk to Rover

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000
who basically he asks you questions

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000
and depending on how you answer it determines what your looks are

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000
so

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
I always cheat and use an FAQ

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000
so that my character will look how I want her to look

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000
um

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000
now with the GameCube one you could also use

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000
the Game Boy Advance to do stuff on the island

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000
you were able to

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000
um

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000
uh

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000
basically get fruits from villagers

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000
you get bells, you would be able to

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000
use the islanders tools

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000
and bury things

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000
and pick them up later

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000
you also were able to um

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000
use uh

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000
the pattern design tool for the Able Sisters

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000
on your Game Boy Advance

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000
so you were able to use that to create

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000
different things

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000
another thing that you know

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000
is still one of my favorite parts of the game

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000
um is that uh

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000
you had a character who

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000
in the Japanese version his name was Toda Keke

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000
who if I remember right

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000
he was named after

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000
a music composer

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000
um over here he's Keke Spider

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000
and he would

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000
he would sing different uh

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.000
songs in the old ones he would

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000
sing in I believe it was the town square

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000
um in later versions

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000
he would also sing at the Roost Cafe

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000
now he actually has Club Lowell

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.000
where he sings on Saturday nights

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000
and you listen to the song and you can

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000
get a demo version and now the stores

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000
actually sell his music

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000
you can also use um the music

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.000
as the album art

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000
on your wall as a poster

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000
but going back to the um

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000
okay here it is it was actually um

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000
Totaka Kazumi

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000
um so that's where Toda Keke's name came from

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.000
so uh

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000
at any rate the game had

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000
absolutely

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.000
adorable music just really neat songs

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.000
you had all kinds of genre

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.000
represented in Toda Keke's music

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.000
um

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000
and then um just the background music

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000
was really iconic I mean

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000
to this day I still like I was

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000
saying I've gone around singing the stupid

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000
theme song to my cat

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.000
you know I'd like to play

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000
the game at certain times of the day because

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000
certain music will play I really

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000
love the midnight music I love to play

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000
at midnight just because of the music

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000
now the other thing that you had going on in this game was

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000
your collection

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000
you could collect um

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000
uh well I'm not gonna

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000
say these are officially a collectible item

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000
but you get the um haniwa

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000
which uh we got as gyroids

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000
which after it rained you could dig them up

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000
in the ground because back in the old school

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000
days haniwa were buried with the dead

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000
so that's why you dig them

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000
up out of the ground

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000
um and

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:58.000
Alpha Kinanagram also wants to point out that

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000
Totaka has um

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000
his uh song which actually

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.000
is in the game

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.000
as Keke's song

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000
the little hidden thing that was also in Mario

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000
Paint and all the different

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.000
you know things that he ever did sound designed

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.000
for so

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000
um

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000
at any rate um you could

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000
collect fish and there are certain fish

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000
that show up at different times of the year you have different

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000
bugs that show up at a different time of the year

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000
you also could collect um works of art

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000
different paintings and like

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.000
and you also had different special

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000
characters that would pop up I already mentioned

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000
Mr. Resetti you had the able sisters

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000
who made the clothes you had

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000
Tom Nook who was the

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000
evil mafia boss of the town

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000
um also there uh

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000
he was the one percent of

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000
my village you had

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000
uh

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000
the police dogs copper

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000
and what was the other one's name

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.000
I can't remember the other one's name

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000
um there were

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000
uh

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000
now we have Isabelle and Digby

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000
in the newer ones uh

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000
Isabelle is your uh apparently she never

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000
sleeps cause she is at the stupid

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000
uh town hall all

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000
the damn time you could change

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.000
your town theme you could change catch

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.000
phrases like we used to make people say some

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.000
really dirty ass things and Nintendo finally got

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000
smart and yeah

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.000
might have been an offender with that

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.000
well I've got um

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.000
Rowan going around wearing the Link

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000
outfit saying kitty fuck

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000
hahaha

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000
um you know

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.000
we used to have Dina remember Dina

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.000
and she apparently

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.000
um is no longer

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000
a gym teacher but a music

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.000
teacher she's a folk singer

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000
Rob staying with her ways

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.000
nice um

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.000
but you know all of your different villagers you've got

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.000
different um types of personalities

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.000
they actually brought back the

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000
uh sort of big sister personality

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000
the perky and the

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.000
uh sort of friendly older brother personality

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000
that were in earlier games

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000
um and different characters that go back and forth

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000
now the other thing with this is it is

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000
and I've mentioned this before

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000
Bobby, Bobby said he made

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000
all this town people say just ignore him

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000
Halo classic game of the year it's not gonna happen

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000
he's trolling you and it's working I know but I'm just

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.000
laughing at him because he's still trying

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000
and it's just not funny

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000
um

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.000
I've made

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000
Ed say I totally suck is his

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.000
greeting and then his catch phrase is

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.000
I really suck

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000
I fucking hate Ed

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.000
um now in the newer ones you've got

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.000
like you can have a campsite where people can

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.000
visit and they'll play stupid games and

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000
steal your money fuckers

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000
I mean just all kinds of stuff to do

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.000
and there's the island you know I mentioned the island

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.000
and

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000
I can't help it I had

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.000
I've had so much fun with

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.000
the first game now to bring up

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000
um what I was talking about about

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.000
the dialogue about it you know since

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000
Japanese is basically a syllabic

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.000
uh alphabet

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000
I picked up the GameCube

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.000
one in Japanese to practice my reading

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000
and lo and behold my

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000
reading actually improved I mean I'm way

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000
out of practice now but it was a

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000
very very good educational tool so

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000
I'm actually offering this out here

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.000
to anyone who happens to be

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.000
a beginner learner who's

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.000
wanting to practice your reading to

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:18.000
understand grammar and syntax

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:20.000
basically get Animal Crossing on GameCube

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000
I mean use it to import

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.000
other copies it will really

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.000
really really help your reading comprehension

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.000
in Japanese and it's not kanji

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000
heavy so

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.000
you don't have to really worry about it

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000
um so anyway

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.000
there's so much to do

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.000
the original was fun

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.000
the newer ones are fun I mean they kind of got

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000
stale with City Folk

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.000
and Wild World but I think

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000
that um the last one

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000
that um New Leaf

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.000
really has brought back a lot

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.000
of the fun that was in the game I mean of course you

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.000
don't have the uh NES games heading around

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.000
but it's still super fun I mean

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000
I think

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.000
anybody can appreciate it I still say though and I said this on

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:02.000
a previous show but I wish they'd just develop a

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:04.000
handful not a lot but a handful of very

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.000
simple like flash style games

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.000
that you could unlock that would be a lot of fun

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.000
or maybe old Game & Watch

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000
oh yeah that would be cool

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.000
things that they don't sell at all in Virtual Console

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.000
until then I will have to make myself

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.000
happy by being very very

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.000
this is the other thing I was going to mention

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.000
is that there was a full length movie

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:24.000
um based off it and it actually had

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:26.000
as your animal characters it had

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:28.000
they were all characters in the game

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:30.000
and one of them lives in my village now

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.000
in the US she's Margie

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:34.000
in uh in Japan she's Sally

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.000
the elephant who's like one of the main main characters

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000
lives in my village and I found out

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.000
that Act Duff has a bouquet

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000
or Rosie in the US one

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000
so I was sort of like oh that's

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.000
cool sort of like a way to be

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000
involved so anyway

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000
um Animal Crossing

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.000
lots of fun alright there it is

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000
your classic game of the week

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:56.000
Animal Forest

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:58.000
or Animal Crossing is the case

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000
maybe uh very awesome

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.000
game I do love that game

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.000
uh yep and I love the 3DS one too

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.000
so um even though I do miss the NES

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000
games but uh a good pick

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000
another great pick while we're going down

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.000
these games that are 10 plus years

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.000
old yet I remember them like they were

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.000
yesterday anyway

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000
you know if Bobby keeps trolling me about Halo it's never

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000
happening oh threatening

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.000
now alright not threatening that's a promise

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.000
alright

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.000
uh we're going to take a quick break guys

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.000
when we come back there is plenty more orange

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.000
songs ready to come including the Fugu question of the week

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.000
some more updates on Wii U and

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.000
Jamie I know is going to be excited

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000
about this release for Steam she will

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:38.000
probably buy this yet again on Steam

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:40.000
it's got to be that good we'll talk

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.000

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.000
episode is in progress

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:08.000
and uh looking at our

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.000
chat room we were playing a kind of a variety

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.000
of music during the break there some

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.000
uh mostly like Super Nintendo classics

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.000
in there uh although we did have Animal

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.000
Crossing music starting it off we did have uh

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.000
I played something from Chrono Trigger

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000
but then I played a Super Metroid song right after it

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.000
to try and troll Bobby back a little bit for you

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:26.000
Dark Sakura but then I followed it with a game

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.000
we can all agree is amazing A Link to the Past

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.000
so just a variety of music and uh

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.000
I like how our chatters who are

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000
with us live on Saturday night will try to shout

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.000
out like what song is that or try to guess the music

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000
while we're playing it so uh always a fun

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.000
time here live but we try to make it fun for the podcast

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:42.000
listeners too I was happy you played Animal

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.000
Crossing for me well you're welcome

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000
cause it makes me happy I miss the first

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.000
game song sooo

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.000
much

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:52.000
I have a really good story about Animal Crossing

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:54.000
and that would be the way like I actually got

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:56.000
Animal Crossing um actually

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.000
Loki actually bought Animal Crossing for

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.000
me um years ago we used to

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:02.000
all put well you know we were all playing DDR we all

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:04.000
used to post on these local forums for

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.000
uh Sacramento DDR players and

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.000
I remember we were all pretty close I mean there was only about

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.000
like maybe 20 of us that actually ever posted on these boards

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.000
regularly but we were all a pretty close group

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.000
you know this was before Facebook and any of

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.000
that shit maybe about the time Live Journal was starting

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:18.000
to boom and uh Loki was

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.000
like you know um

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.000
what would you do if you just got a big bonus at work

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:24.000
what would you spend the money on I said I'd get a

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.000
GameCube and Animal Crossing and I come home from work

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.000
and what did Loki do he bought me a GameCube and Animal

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.000
Crossing it was one of the nicest things

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.000
it was one of the nicest things anyone's ever done for me so

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.000
now we're all poor as much of an asshole

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:36.000
as you are on this show sometimes Loki

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000
deep down in he's a really nice guy so

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:42.000
there you go I told a nice story

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.000
about Loki on this show but no I

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000
really appreciated that to this day that was like one of

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.000
a really awesome thing so

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.000
uh so hearing the music I

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.000
came home and that was on loop because I guess they

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.000
left it powered on I don't even know how you got into the house

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.000
you must have contacted my roommate at the time or something

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.000
yeah and uh set that all

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:00.000
up so that when I got home from work it was already on the

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.000
TV it was really cool so

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.000
alright well let's get back into some

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.000
rapid fire wait I gotta ask before

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.000
we get into rapid fire news Chell

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.000

mom she's got a yarn shop but um

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:54.000
do you wanna what do you wanna do

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.000
very

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.000
excuse me I'm choking on a sunflower seed very nice

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.000
well good luck with uh all of those

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.000
projects and I like the belt you got going on

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.000
so far it looks very intricate with the way you kind of have to

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.000
tie that together so yeah it's it's my third

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000
so I've I've kind of it's been a steep learning

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.000
curve trust me well yeah

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.000
I can't even do this I can't even sew

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000
hey I hear the 70s are making a comeback

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000
it actually is looking really good

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.000
I like it it's cool all right you should post

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.000
a picture on the tumbler or something one of those places

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.000
all right uh let's

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000
get to some rapid fire news and

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000
uh quickly running down a few

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000
of the fast game stories this week

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000
Loki all right so the mighty number

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000
nine kickstarter finally finished

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.000
and they ended up with four million

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:40.000
dollars and

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:42.000
uh will be coming out on a lot of different platforms

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.000
like spring 2015

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000
let's say

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000
maybe summer of 2015

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000
because we all know how these kickstarters are

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:52.000
uh Xbox 360, Xbox one

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000
PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Vita, 3DS

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.000
pretty much every platform everything everything

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.000
got funded for everything I forgot to kickstart it

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.000
oh well that's fine did I

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.000
not say it

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.000
would get funded for everything I know you

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.000
did I predicted I just

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:08.000
I forgot they had the PayPal

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:10.000
and that the $150,000 in the

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.000
PayPal was going into the funds too

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.000
I forgot about that they still made

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.000
like other kickstarters they still may take money

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.000
via PayPal after

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.000
you know everything's said and done

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.000
it's fine I'll just wait

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.000
and buy it yeah it's spring 2015

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000
fuck why am I buying stuff that comes out in 2015

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.000
exactly I need the money

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.000
now yeah I'm not buying stuff that comes out in

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:32.000
2014 yet let alone but thanks

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.000
to everybody who funded it for me so I can buy it

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.000
later

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.000
all right and uh

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.000
I know this game was crack for us

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000
a little bit ago

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000
seems like a little bit ago probably a couple years ago

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.000
tiny tower

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:48.000
is back and now tiny tower

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.000
has a new licensed product

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.000
Star Wars tiny

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.000
death star

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.000
coming to a mobile platform near you

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:58.000
that sounds kind of awesome I've got to say

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:00.000
are you going to build a tiny death star dark

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.000
sakura maybe

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.000
she's already building one in her house no

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.000
because I have

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:08.000
I have a

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:10.000
I have a village to run I'm the mayor

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:12.000
I'm empress sakura of normandy and I don't have time

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.000
for a death star

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.000
this makes me think of when they did that whole like

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.000
what's that website where you can do the white house

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.000
petitions or whatever and somebody

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000
actually asks whitehouse.org

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000
maybe or .gov

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.000
I thought they had like a spinoff site or something where you can do the

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:28.000
petitions specifically

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.000
oh I thought it was like a separate website

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:32.000
I don't know if I'm looking forward to

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:34.000
the inevitable

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.000
version you know kill ball heights

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.000
you know where they

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.000
have where you know

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:42.000
design your own

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:44.000
yeah

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.000
and then finally

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000
you know because there's a lot of movie

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.000
or games

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:52.000
based on movies coming out but we have another

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:54.000
date for one warcraft

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:56.000
the movie coming to theaters

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.000
December 18th 2015

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000
and

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:02.000
yeah

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:04.000
hell I know need for speeds coming

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.000
out next spring

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000
I kind of want to see it just because it looks like

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.000
a generic racing action movie

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.000
we still don't know who's

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.000
in the cast for the warcraft movie though just a date

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.000
and I'm thinking like

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.000
ok that's a placeholder date that's one of those

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.000
hollywood games of chess

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.000
where they start to block out what movies

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:24.000
are coming out when and get away from my movie

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.000
and all that and you know

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:28.000
so don't hold fast that this

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.000
will actually go through

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.000
because it might get delayed to 2016

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.000
it might come out earlier sometimes movies come out

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.000
earlier although I doubt that because I haven't even started filming

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:38.000
yet so

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.000
yeah I mean I don't know

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.000
I guess it starts filming next year

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.000
in January but

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.000
I'm not really excited

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.000
for it because I don't know any of the

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:50.000
lore so it's just like hey

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.000
Lord of the Rings again or something

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.000
if the movie is going to be successful it's got to be accessible

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.000
to non warcraft players

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:58.000
it has to be all about thrall

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.000
I don't care I want thrall the movie

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:02.000
I think they're taking it way back well it was supposed to be alliance centered

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.000
but that was an early rumor

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.000
but Varian's a dick and no one cares

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.000
I think it's going back I don't think the game

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:10.000
is going to be based off of World of Warcraft

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.000
or the movie is going to be based off of

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.000
World of Warcraft I think the movie is going to be based off of

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:16.000
Warcraft or like Warcraft 3

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.000
maybe well that's cool

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:20.000
because then you get

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:22.000
a what's your face who I think is awesome

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:24.000
Sylvanas that'd be cool

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000
now Tigerclaw

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.000
points out that the Warcraft movie is going to

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:30.000
December 2015 because 2015 is

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:32.000
overcrowded with some huge blockbuster

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.000
movies during the summer already

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.000
yeah isn't that when the

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:38.000
Age of Ultros comes out is 2015

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:40.000
as well right Avengers 2

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:42.000
and then what else is in the summer

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.000
2015 is that when Independence Day 2 is

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.000
finally happening oh my god I'm so

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.000
excited I only care about

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:50.000
it see like it starts you know

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.000
just like you know last Independence Day I saw it

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:54.000
was a third fourth and fifth I

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.000
kind of want to do that again I hope it's terrible

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:58.000
I hope it's absolutely I hope it is absolutely

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:00.000
god awful and I will be there every day I hope

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.000
Elizabeth Berkley is on the cast because that would be

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.000
awesome but it still has to have Jeff

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:06.000
Goldblum it is supposedly having

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:08.000
Jeff Goldblum the only one that's not coming back is Will Smith

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:10.000
but it'll be like Will Smith's kid

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:12.000
because he's like I'm a real actor now bye

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.000
Will Smith's kid well it's not even Will Smith's kid

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:16.000
it's just going to be some other like

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:18.000
other dude that's going to be like some

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:20.000
some other black pilot you know that's

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.000
going to be in the role who cares

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:24.000
you know what it doesn't matter it's not all about

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:26.000
Will Smith you know what they need uh

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.000
Randy Quaid ghost only way

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:30.000
they can make this movie Randy Quaid ghost

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:32.000
slash zombie the chat room

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:34.000
is making fun of me because apparently I had

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:36.000
a Freudian slip and I said age of

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.000
Ultros instead of Ultron

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:40.000
you know you've been playing too much

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:42.000
Final Fantasy when dot dot

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:44.000
dot wow

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:46.000
it would make for a more interesting movie

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.000
to be honest yeah it's true

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:50.000
honestly let's be real it would be a better

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:52.000
movie okay I'm I'm

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:54.000
I'm pissed because no actually

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:56.000
in the Marvel comics right now they're

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:58.000
they're pushing an age of Ultron right now

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:00.000
and I think that's the only reason why the next

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:02.000
movie is going to be Ultron

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:04.000
because it was fully set up for

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:06.000
Thanos hello yeah I know right

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:08.000
they just want to make you wait till three

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:10.000
I just I just thought of a tagline since

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:12.000
we're bringing Elizabeth Berkeley

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:14.000
into the cast as she should be uh

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:16.000
independence Independence Day

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:18.000
everybody got independence and shit

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:20.000
that

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:22.000
that is so obscure

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:24.000
there's like maybe five percent of the

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:26.000
audience if that is going to get that reference

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:28.000
but I love you just a little bit

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:30.000
more for making it Rob what

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.000
darling you are independent

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:36.000
I don't know what you're doing

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.000
in that jet but it sure as hell

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:40.000
ain't fighting any

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:42.000
no

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:44.000
one understands no

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:46.000
one I think the people who do understand

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:48.000
will make up for the ones that don't other movies

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:50.000
coming out in 2015 star wars

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:52.000
uh star wars episode seven

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:54.000
star star what

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:56.000
yeah

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:58.000
some flop movie in space

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.000
no I'm kidding actually if the rumors are true that Daniel

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:02.000
Day-Lewis is going to be in it

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:04.000
like that guy can like he could

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.000
act the phone book and it would be amazing

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:08.000
did you see the mock-up poster that some

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:10.000
I think it was like a photoshopping job but it was

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:12.000
sure it was really cool yeah that

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:14.000
had like the original actors and everything

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:16.000
you know looking their age and all that

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:18.000
as the characters would have been later on

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:20.000
that's pretty cool oh I do want drunk

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:22.000
Carrie Fisher in the movie so that would be

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:24.000
awesome

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:26.000
uh yeah oh man

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:28.000
alright and also in 2015 sorry I know this is

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:30.000
rapid fire news I'm using my quoting fingers

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:32.000
also in 2015 let's not forget

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:34.000
Batfleck is in 2015

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:36.000
and

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:38.000
you know what here's the thing though

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:40.000
here's the thing I

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:42.000
love Batman

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:44.000
stuff and

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:46.000
my favorite Batman honestly

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:48.000
is the Adam West era Batman

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:50.000
um

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:52.000
can it really get any cheesier than that

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.000
I don't know yeah but did you see

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.000
Daredevil well that was bad

01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:58.000
can it really be worse than Batman and Robin

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.000
can it really get any worse

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:02.000
that's a good good question cause

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:04.000
that movie was bad you know the only reason

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:06.000
I saw it was because someone else paid for

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:08.000
it and drugged me along to see it

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:10.000
must be nice cause I wasn't gonna

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:12.000
spend any money on that and that's still two hours of my life

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:14.000
I can't get back I wanted to see it because

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:16.000
there is no such way there is no

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:18.000
way that Arnold

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:20.000
Schwarzenegger as Mr. Freeze is not gonna be

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:22.000
entertaining there is like no

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:24.000
way everybody chews

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:26.000
there is no way that's not gonna be entertaining

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:28.000
oh god as a lifelong Batman

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.000
fan I'm kinda resigned to the fact that he kinda

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:32.000
goes in cycles you got the goofy Adam

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:34.000
Westing kinda thing then you got the ultra

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:36.000
super serious reboot and then you

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:38.000
got you know it bleeds into the Adam Westing again

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:40.000
eh you know come back around

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:42.000
I'll give it a chance because everybody

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:44.000
hated the idea of Michael Keaton as well

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:46.000
and he turned out to be awesome but here's the

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:48.000
thing the original Batman was also

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:50.000
a Tim Burton movie and then

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:52.000
you know who was the guy that did the next trilogy

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:54.000
why am I his name is slipping my mind right now

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:56.000
no not Schumacher fuck him the next guy

01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:58.000
those movies were terrible the guy who just did

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:00.000
these recent three where did he get the goddamn name

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:02.000
oh my god

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:04.000
bad fan

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:06.000
well I'll put it

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:08.000
he proved himself and when he cast Heath Ledger

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:10.000
I know a lot of people were skeptical but I was like

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:12.000
no Batman Begins was the shit

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:14.000
Christopher Nolan thank you Christopher Nolan

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.000
Batman Begins was the shit

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:18.000
this guy knows what he's doing I will trust

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.000
his judgement but here's the thing Zach

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.000
Snyder I don't

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.000
know about you sir

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:26.000
for the record by the way I am not

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:28.000
going to see it because I am currently

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:30.000
on a DC boycott

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:32.000
no I'm serious

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:34.000
because of how they're

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:36.000
treating their writers for their portrayal

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:38.000
of women in their comics and

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:40.000
for the whole marriage bullshit

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.000
just so that they don't have to let Batwoman

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:44.000
get married yeah that was a little weird

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:46.000
also their audition for a new

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.000
artist here draw Harley Quinn trying to

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:50.000
kill herself in three panels sexy

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.000
underwear sexy yeah that was a little weird

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:54.000
DC needs

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:56.000
to be a publicist they've seriously

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:58.000
fallen off the taste truck

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:00.000
off of the progressive taste truck

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:02.000
because DC used to be pretty progressive

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:04.000
with their characters and hit every branch

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:06.000
on the idiot tree and they've fallen

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:08.000
into the stinky

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:10.000
republican onion truck alright

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:12.000
look moving on

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:14.000
to something happy much more

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:16.000
happier and gay and I mean it

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:18.000
I like gay gamerX

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:20.000

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:22.000
gamerX2 electric

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:24.000
boogaloo no that's just what I think it should be

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:26.000
called but it's gamerX2 it

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:28.000

the 13th of 2014

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:32.000
they have moved to a venue that is

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:34.000
three times as large thank god

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:36.000
it's the Intercontinental Hotel

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:38.000
in San Francisco which is right next to Moscone

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:40.000
Center if I'm not mistaking and they've

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:42.000
already announced some of the guests for it

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:44.000

signed up as a sponsor of the event

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:48.000
which cross your fingers

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:50.000
your toes hold your breath

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:52.000
this means an exclusive gamerX

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:54.000
set of cards because that would be

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:56.000

and so much more out there

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:46.000
I know there's plans to do something

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:48.000
podcast cross zone 2 but like

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:50.000
bigger better

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.000
and it's going to have to be

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:54.000
with all these extra people that now want to be a part

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:56.000
of it which is a great thing

01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:58.000
what a horrible situation to be in

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:00.000
it's too popular of an event

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:02.000
I want to go

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:04.000
you can get your tickets now

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:06.000
but if you can't get them right now because of financial whatever

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:08.000
they'll be on sale until they're not

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:10.000
we need to do a panel

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:12.000
it'll be fun I think we should

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:14.000
let's do a panel

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:16.000
alright we'll talk we'll get to talking

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:18.000
anyhow gamerX.com if you want more information

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:20.000
on that information on Rocksmith

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:22.000
2014 edition

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:24.000
adding some more songs to kind of round

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:26.000
out their song list

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:28.000
Rocksmith 2014 edition will include

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:30.000
Def Leppard's Pour Some Sugar On Me

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:32.000
Queen's

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:34.000
We Are The Champions

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:36.000
and Mary Jane's Last Dance from Tom Petty

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:38.000
and the Heartbreakers

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:40.000
and a song for Bobby Rush is going to be in the game

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:42.000
with the Spirit of Radio

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:44.000
I love Rush. Rush is Canada's best

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:46.000
export

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:48.000
I still love Alanis Morissette that's the 90's kid in me

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:50.000
but anyway some disagree with me

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:52.000
but deal with it

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:54.000
there's lots of great songs in the game I'm not going to read the entire song list

01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:56.000
but remember that Rocksmith is like

01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:58.000
the no really stop hitting plastic

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:00.000
buttons and learn how to play an actual

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:02.000
guitar so you know

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:04.000
if you want to go to guitar school Rocksmith 2014

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:06.000
is the way to do it. Also there's

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:08.000
what's called color blind mode which I think is

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:10.000
pretty cool

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:12.000
one of the producers is actually color blind

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:14.000
and you can actually adjust the hues

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:16.000
and the color saturation levels throughout

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:18.000
the entire game to be a little

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:20.000
better for the color blind because I guess

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:22.000
the first game got a little flack for

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:24.000
it so they are going to make it a little better

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:26.000
this time around so kudos for accessibility

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:28.000
and lastly

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:30.000
coming to an arcade

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:32.000
near you

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:34.000
yes an arcade near you

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:36.000
Plants vs. Zombies

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:38.000
The Last Stand

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:40.000
I'm assuming they turn Plants vs. Zombies

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:42.000
into a ticket spitter because that's

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:44.000
all arcade games are anymore

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:46.000
yeah it is a

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:48.000
video redemption product yes yes of course

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:50.000
there's already a

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:52.000
bejeweled one that surprised me I've never seen one

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:54.000
of those but I guess that is out there but yes

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:56.000
look for more information on Plants vs. Zombies coming

01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:58.000
to an arcade near you soon

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:00.000
Dark Sakura

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:02.000
we're actually having a small discussion

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:04.000
in chat by the way

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:06.000
there needs to be the Jessica Jones

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:08.000
TV show I'm going to cry

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:10.000
have you been watching Shield at all?

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:12.000
no and I need to

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:14.000
but

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:16.000
Jessica Jones is my favorite Marvel character

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:18.000
ever and if none of you have read

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:20.000
Alias which had nothing to do with the TV show

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:22.000
read it well if Shield goes anything

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:24.000
like another ABC show Once Upon a

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:26.000
Time they will roll out

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:28.000
those characters just to like

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:30.000
make you watch now they have their

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:32.000
spin-off yeah they have the spin-off they just released

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:34.000
a picture of Jafar apparently for some reason

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:36.000
is in Wonderland I'm not even going to try and figure that one

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:38.000
out but it's just like you know

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:40.000
who can we roll out next?

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:42.000
yeah Chell what'd you want to say

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:44.000
yeah the character thing

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:46.000
I was you know

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:48.000
I started watching

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:50.000
Once Upon a Time as kind of my trashy show

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:52.000
and then I got emotionally involved

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:54.000
and then it jumped the shark like

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:56.000
whoa and I'm just

01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:58.000
I'm basically watching it out of train wreck syndrome

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:00.000
so yeah I hadn't heard about Jafar

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:02.000
but now I need to check out the freaking

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:04.000
Alice in Wonderland well here's the thing

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:06.000
even I'm not really watching

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:08.000
Once Upon a Time but it is like next on my

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:10.000
list once I finish off Scandal

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:12.000
which is far more important but

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:14.000
even I've seen

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:16.000
the pictures of Captain Hook

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:18.000
and that is uh oh yeah

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:20.000
you know I said

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:22.000
you know not even Robert Carlyle can get me

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:24.000
back for the third series they got me back

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:28.000
for my

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:30.000
rapid fire news there's

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:32.000
I am getting so sick of these

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:34.000
websites that are not iPad

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:36.000
compatible uh oh

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:38.000
fuck them um this actually

01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:40.000
is uh called the not on

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:42.000
Steam still which I'm trying to give you guys

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:44.000
some advertising but your site's

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:46.000
not working on my iPad so why should

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:48.000
I um basically it's about

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:50.000
66 games that are not

01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:52.000
on Steam they're all by indie developers

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:54.000
that are for sale at

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:56.000
notonsteam.com

01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:58.000
Super Markdown there's some really cool

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:00.000
stuff like um girls like robots

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:02.000
Photonica uh Uzi

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:04.000
Earth Adventure One Finger Death Punch

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:06.000
which actually I think is now on

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:08.000
Steam. What's Pushcat?

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:10.000
That one I haven't checked out

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:12.000
there's one called Rose in Time

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:14.000
there's uh scanning a truck driving simulator

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:16.000
Six Sided Sanctuary

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:18.000
looked like a fun one I almost bought that one

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:20.000
The Sea Will Claim Everything

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:22.000
Tiny Barbarian DX

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:24.000
lots of really neat games on there and there's also

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:26.000
Alphas there's another game on here by the way

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:28.000
that's called We'll Fight for Food

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:30.000
Nice. Oh this one

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:32.000
called Spud's Quest looks cute

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:34.000
yeah there's just a lot of neat looking games on there

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:36.000
Nice. And in a not

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:38.000
so indie game um

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:40.000
we all like Borderlands don't we?

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:42.000
Well

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:44.000
2k and Gearbox

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:46.000
have a $100,000

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:48.000
worth of prizes for an

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:50.000
in-game loot hunt for Borderlands

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:52.000
2 so basically on

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:54.000
October 11th at 10

01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:56.000
Eastern Time

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:58.000
the game will be altered so

01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:00.000
that these weird guns are gonna start

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:02.000
dropping in odd places

01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:04.000
so like

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:06.000
the knuckle dragger will drop on

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:08.000
Gwen's head

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:10.000
no sorry the knuckle dragger will drop Gwen's head

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:12.000
my apologies

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:14.000
so basically you fulfill

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:16.000
their little requirements and

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:18.000
you could win a prize. I will not tell you

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:20.000
anymore about it cause you need to go check it out yourself

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:22.000
and then

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:24.000
last but not least there is a new Sonic

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:26.000
game in development for

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:28.000
Xbox One and PS4 and Wii U

01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:30.000
and

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:32.000
I believe it's just a working

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:34.000
title Sonic Thunderstorm or Sonic

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:36.000
Blue Thunder

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:38.000
there is

01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:40.000
a

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:42.000
looks like there's going to be

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:44.000
a new character named static

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:46.000
the hedgehog and

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:48.000
a teenage clone of Sonic Knuckles

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:50.000
Rogue Eggman will also have teenage clones

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:52.000
and

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:54.000
Knuckles clone will be called

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:56.000
Slash the Echidna. Hurray more shitty

01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:58.000
friends static the hedgehog

01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:00.000
he doesn't move very much

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:02.000
he's very placement

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:04.000
he's a pretty clingy friend

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:06.000
you can also play as Tails, Amy, Debra

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:08.000
all these other characters

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:10.000
and you also have team Chaotix

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:12.000
which is all that I care about

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:14.000
29 levels, different objects, return of old animals

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:16.000
and chaos drives and

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:18.000
the Chao Garden

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:20.000
game play will

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:22.000
change characters like in Sonic Heroes

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:24.000
there's just a bunch of stuff I don't know if it's gonna be any good

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:26.000
but there is the return of the chaos emeralds

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:28.000
yes but what mode

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:30.000
allows me to make them act out

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:32.000
my fan fictions

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:34.000
none, sit down

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:36.000
they're also saying that

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:38.000
wi-fi will transfer Chao data

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:40.000
and you have a Chao Garden

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:42.000
it will be

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:44.000
DLC and available in PS Vita and 3DS

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:46.000
so

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:48.000
yay

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:50.000
it better not suck

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:52.000
let's hope this is a good Sonic game

01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:54.000
don't they kind of alternate back and forth

01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:56.000
like Star Trek movies

01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:58.000
except that

01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:00.000
doesn't apply to the

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:02.000
Star Trek re-releases

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:04.000
the revamps

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:06.000
because both of them have been good

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:08.000
I think the first one was way better than the second one

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:10.000
but that's just me

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:12.000
womp womp

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:14.000
let's get to

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:16.000
the FUGL question

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:18.000
of the week

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:20.000
every week we ask our listeners

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:22.000
a question on Facebook

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:24.000
and Google Plus

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:26.000
you put that together and you get FUGL

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:28.000
the FUGL question of the week and this week

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:30.000
as I promised it's gonna be all about Pokemon

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:32.000
so we asked our listeners

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:34.000
the most important question possibly

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:36.000
of the millennium

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:38.000
are you team Fennekin

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:40.000
Chespin or Froakie

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:42.000
and for those that don't know

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:44.000
those are the starter Pokemon

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:46.000
in the new X and Y

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:48.000
they're like Bulbasaur

01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:50.000
what about option 14 don't give a fuck

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:52.000
well actually I did ask

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:54.000
as part of the question

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:56.000
Pokemon mania looks to be starting all over again

01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:58.000
in just a week what do you think of Pokemon

01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:00.000
are you picking up X and Y

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:02.000
or are you shocked at the number of grown adults

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:04.000
who obsess over Pokemon

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:06.000
so let's go to Google Plus first

01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:08.000
where actdef says team Fennekin

01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:10.000
and then he gives us a link to a

01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:12.000
community on livejournal

01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:14.000
called Pokemon collectors

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:16.000
talking about

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:18.000
his second question and I see that

01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:20.000
there's two 3DS's

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:22.000
stuffed animals

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:24.000
yeah actdef might have a problem

01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:26.000
but that's okay we still like you

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:28.000
he says seriously though

01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:30.000
I've been a Pokemon fan since the red

01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:32.000
blue yellow days and I don't see

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:34.000
leaving the Pokemon games and

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:36.000
fandom in his time soon I'm so hyped for X and Y

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:38.000
Jim or excuse me

01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:40.000
Flaco Jones says

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:42.000
despite my love of RPGs I never

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:44.000
got into Pokemon in the first place

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:46.000
now when they come out with a game it seems like

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:48.000
they just expand on old stuff to make the fans

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:50.000
happy a new Pokemon release has never

01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:52.000
said to me hey you've never played this

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:54.000
before but this version will really pull

01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:56.000
you into the series to be fair

01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:58.000
I think they're trying to do that with X and Y a little bit

01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:00.000
one thing I noticed about the 3 starter

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:02.000
Pokemon is that their final forms

01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:04.000
kind of fall into the fighter

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:06.000
mage thief

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:08.000
kind of generalisms

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:10.000
you expect in RPGs I found that interesting

01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:12.000
Evel

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:14.000
which

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:16.000
might be pronounced that way or E3VL

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:18.000
I'm not sure but Evel responds and says

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:20.000
I'm only purchasing one version of the game

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:22.000
this time around why

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:24.000
seeing the diverse age groups who enjoy the franchise

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:26.000
I hope the creators make the plot more complex

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:28.000
or adult oriented so that varying age

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:30.000
demographics may have a more meaningful

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:32.000
discussion while playing the game together

01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:34.000
well yeah but it's Pokemon I mean how

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:36.000
deep is it gonna get

01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:38.000
just saying just saying my personal opinion

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:40.000
alright going over to Facebook for some answers

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:42.000
Seattle says

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:44.000
I'm looking to

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:46.000
Team Froakie closely

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:48.000
followed by Team Fennekin and I'm picking up

01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:50.000
Y as soon as I can get into the Evel G

01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:52.000
to get it as for what I think of the Pokemon

01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:54.000
series Yellow was the first game that I

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:56.000
actually owned so they hold a place in

01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:58.000
my heart in gaming library which reminds me

01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:00.000
I need to make an attempt at figuring out what is wrong with my

01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:02.000
copy of Yellow

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:04.000
Shane replied and Shane is Team Chesspin

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:06.000
and I have been counting down the days since

01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:08.000
January which is when they announced the games

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:10.000
but had no release dates

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:12.000
this is the most important release this year

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:14.000
it is already my game of 2013

01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:16.000
you sound like Loki talking about a different

01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:18.000
game just a few weeks ago

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:20.000
JVMON replies

01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:22.000
and says Team Froakie I've never

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:24.000
chosen a non water starter

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:26.000
ever since I chose Squirtle and Pokemon Blue

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:28.000
now my only decision is between

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:30.000
X and Y lucky I have both reserved

01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:32.000
so I can decide on release day

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:34.000
Pokemon will always be a go to game for me

01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:36.000
sure the structure is predictable but that's part of the charm

01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:38.000
For the Fallen Dreams says

01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:40.000
Team Fennekin motherfuckers

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:42.000
I'm 22 and

01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:44.000
Pokemon will never get old to me

01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:46.000
it's hands down the best handheld RPG in my

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:48.000
opinion it's the sole reason I'm getting a 3DS

01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:50.000
minus a few other titles it's a breath

01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:52.000
of fresh air from the constant gore

01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:54.000
and violence from more adult oriented video games

01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:56.000
Clover N says

01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:58.000
my wife and I have pre-ordered an X and

01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:00.000
a Y I always choose water type

01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:02.000
and my wife always chooses grass type

01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:04.000
and let's see

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:06.000
going to the next answer

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:08.000
Burr says Fennekin all the way

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:10.000
I'll see if I can pick it up I haven't actually finished

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:12.000
a Pokemon game yet though I got the

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:14.000
furthest in blue when I first

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:16.000
flirted with it during my freshman year of college

01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:18.000
TimTrip

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:20.000
replied and said gonna have to go with Chespin

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:22.000
I don't obsess over Pokemon

01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:24.000
but there is a lot about it that is surprisingly

01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:26.000
compelling I don't play every generation

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:28.000
because the changes have always been a bit too

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:30.000
incremental from the looks of it

01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:32.000
XY has made some significant forward steps

01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:34.000
without changing the core of what makes Pokemon

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:36.000
fun so I'll be picking up a copy

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:38.000
Matt J says I've yet to decide

01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:40.000
on my starter so can't commit to a team

01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:42.000
yet I'm not surprised at all that so

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:44.000
many adults are into Pokemon I'm nearly 29

01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:46.000
and still love it however you think

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:48.000
folks around my age were kids when the first

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:50.000
Pokemon games came out I was only 13

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:52.000
when Red and Blue came out here many

01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:54.000
of us adults grew up on the series it made

01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:56.000
a mark on us a mark that sticks with us to this

01:59:56.000 --> 01:59:58.000
day GeoVidea says I

01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:00.000
don't even have a 3DS yet hoping for

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:02.000
it as a holiday gift hint hint

02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:04.000
and I always pick

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:06.000
fire types it's all about the burn

02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:08.000
Andy R says

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:10.000
I got pretty bored with the last few games I didn't even

02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:12.000
finish white I'm still considering

02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:14.000
buying X or Y but it will probably depend more on

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:16.000
how many of my friends pick it up am I shocked

02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:18.000
at grown adults obsessing over Pokemon

02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:20.000
no nostalgia is a powerful force

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:22.000
Fifth Dream says Froakie

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:24.000
all the way I always pick water type

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:26.000
starters unless I'm playing a second game

02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:28.000
in a generation then I pick a grass

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:30.000
I even bought a Team Froakie

02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:32.000
t-shirt to wear when I go pick up my

02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:34.000
copy of Pokemon X I'm 39

02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:36.000
years old so I am one of those

02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:38.000
grown adults who love Pokemon I've

02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:40.000
played it since Blue came out and have played

02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:42.000
every single generation some twice

02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:44.000
and the spinoffs so yeah Pokemon's great

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:46.000
Raginator says I'm on

02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:48.000
team who gives a fuck finally

02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:50.000
well I mean we haven't

02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:52.000
we haven't had anyone yet say

02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:54.000
I don't care but here's Raginator to

02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:56.000
break that trend saying I'm not getting

02:00:56.000 --> 02:00:58.000
Pokemon X and Y I've yet to buy any

02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:00.000
Pokemon game I'm not going to start now

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:02.000
Pokemon is about as interesting as being

02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:04.000
repeatedly anal probed by aliens

02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:06.000
non-stop for six months followed by swimming

02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:08.000
in raw sewage you're nasty

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:10.000
you nasty you know what but it's

02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:12.000
it's hard I don't think one can make

02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:14.000
a judgement until they've played one yeah what's the

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:16.000
why there though I'm not hearing the

02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:18.000
why do you feel so strongly

02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:20.000
against Pokemon I'm not hearing that some people

02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:22.000
just want to be ornery

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:24.000
yeah I don't know did you just post that

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:26.000
for shock value sir

02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:28.000
alright degenerate Johnny says I'm with team

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:30.000
frokey because it rhymes with Loki

02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:36.000
alright

02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:38.000
anyway I'm not at all surprised that so many

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:40.000
adults play these games because

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:42.000
they want to rub it in the faces of six year olds

02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:44.000
I mean to dominate six year I mean

02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:46.000
I really mean never mind I give it up

02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:48.000
our pal wicked from the

02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:50.000
nerdgasm network says I've been out of the Pokemon

02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:52.000
fold since emerald and given how

02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:54.000
X Y looks like a pseudo reboot

02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:56.000
it looks like it's time to get back in I'm glad

02:01:56.000 --> 02:01:58.000
that we're finally getting a game that looks like the

02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:00.000
anime and while the Pokemon count is

02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:02.000
count is utterly nutterly butterly

02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:04.000
I still think there's a lot

02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:06.000
to be had in collecting them all to collect

02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:08.000
them all I'm going for frokey

02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:10.000
because Greninja looks

02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:12.000
sick as hell plus I'll have a fire

02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:14.000
starter from the Torchic special

02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:16.000
event and I can never say no to having a Bulbasaur

02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:18.000
a well rounded team ahoy

02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:20.000
uh Hitstun says at the moment I think

02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:22.000
I'm getting Pokemon X and starting with Chespin

02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:24.000
once the game's been out for a week and we

02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:26.000
know more about the popular Pokemon and how to

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:28.000
counter pick them I'll be ready to delete

02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:30.000
my save, start again, and

02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:32.000
work towards my ideal team from the beginning

02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:34.000
I already preordered Pokemon

02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:36.000
Blue fifteen years ago but I skipped

02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:38.000
generations three and five completely

02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:40.000
building a good competitive team is a lot

02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:42.000
of work but it's worth it when the game is new

02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:44.000
and my friends are playing it too

02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:46.000
SSG100Matt says Pokemon came out in 1998

02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:48.000
and I've been playing it since then I'm

02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:50.000
almost thirty which means I have played

02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:52.000
Pokemon for half my life

02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:54.000
I will get Pokemon Y when I finish

02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:56.000
Black 2 sigh

02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:58.000
and lastly Codeman I'm

02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:00.000
not sure about Pokemon I love

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:02.000
the blue and red but I just can't add to

02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:04.000
it the huge amount of games I will have on the

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:06.000
table already I will be picking up

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:08.000
a 2DS so maybe then I'll try it

02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:10.000
for now probably not

02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:12.000
but I was a huge fan of the Pokemon anime

02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:14.000
it was fantastic so

02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:16.000
overwhelming Pokemon

02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:18.000
fans versus non

02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:20.000
Pokemon fans

02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:22.000
there

02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:24.000
and kind of even it sounded pretty even

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:26.000
on who's picking up what starter so

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:28.000
I will say this that for all the past

02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:30.000
ones that I have played I've

02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:32.000
always started with a fire type

02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:34.000
that's just been me Fennekin's super cute

02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:36.000
that's what team oh and

02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:38.000
to answer the question earlier in the show I am team

02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:40.000
Fennekin absolutely

02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:42.000
I have no idea what that is

02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:44.000
he's a little Firefox not to be confused

02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:46.000
with a popular web browser ok well if he's

02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:48.000
a fox and on fire maybe I have to get the game

02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:50.000
let me show you

02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:52.000
does it like fire

02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:54.000
oh my god that's fucking cute

02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:56.000
right

02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:58.000
that's Fennekin let me show you the others just to compare

02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:00.000
that's Fennekin do you remember when we went to that E3

02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:02.000
and I came back with all those damn Pokemon plushies

02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:04.000
like the plus and minus

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:06.000
that's Chespin

02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:08.000
the grass type oh he looks angry

02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:10.000
in that particular picture he does here's a

02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:12.000
happy Chespin just to be fair

02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:14.000
there you go and uh

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:16.000
here is

02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:18.000
fro-key

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:20.000
looking that up right now ew no one gives a shit

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:24.000
ok so we know it looks like an old

02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:26.000
like a frog with a beard on his back

02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:28.000
ok so Jamie is definitely

02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:30.000
not team fro-key

02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:34.000
Fennekin's cute I go with Fennekin

02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:36.000
even if I'm not getting the game I vote for

02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:38.000
Fennekin thank you

02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:40.000
thank you Dark Sakura who has a

02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:42.000
partially correct opinion

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:44.000
hey

02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:46.000
yeah Act Deaf I had Plessy

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:48.000
and Minun whoever

02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:50.000
but I gave them to my friend

02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:52.000
Julie because I don't care

02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:54.000
I was in a good mood this week so I read

02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:56.000

02:04:56.000 --> 02:04:58.000

02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:00.000

you guys for your answers and don't forget

02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:10.000
those of you out there listening don't forget to follow us

02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:12.000
on those communities

02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:14.000
alright more long form news Loki

02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:16.000
starting us off

02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:18.000
alright so

02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:20.000
layoffs

02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:22.000
god you don't like them

02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:24.000
but it happens so there's a

02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:26.000
couple companies laying off people first off

02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:28.000
Sega of America is confirming

02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:30.000
an unspecific number of layoffs I'm assuming

02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:32.000
this is tying in with the fact

02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:34.000
that you know they are taking on Atlas

02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:36.000
and perhaps there's just

02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:38.000
you know

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:40.000
some of those jobs kind of overlapping

02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:42.000
each other

02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:44.000
so basically

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:46.000
as the gaming industry continues to

02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:48.000
evolve companies must adapt

02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:50.000
and adjust in order to compete and succeed

02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:52.000
in an ever changing environment as the

02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:54.000
result Sega of America has recently undergone

02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:56.000
a restructure that will enable the

02:05:56.000 --> 02:05:58.000
company to focus efficiently on developing

02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:00.000
new and existing content across

02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:02.000
digital platforms as well as continuing to focus

02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:04.000
on key brands for packaged goods

02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:06.000
alright

02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:08.000
so yeah

02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:10.000
and then

02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:12.000
Capcom well that sucks what else can you

02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:14.000
say I mean I know layoffs are kind of

02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:16.000
inevitable in this industry but it

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:18.000
always makes you sad especially when it's like big companies

02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:20.000
like Sega you know yeah also

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:22.000
Capcom Europe apparently is going

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:24.000
to be laying off more than half of its staff

02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:26.000
and this

02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:28.000
is coming from I guess MCV

02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:30.000
who understands more than

02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:32.000
they're saying more than half of the

02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:34.000
firm faces redundancy with

02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:36.000
the number of jobs set to merge

02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:38.000
so

02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:40.000
that kind of sucks

02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:42.000
and I guess following a

02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:44.000
restructure in the US operation Capcom

02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:46.000
Europe organization is currently evaluating

02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:48.000
its structure to ensure it's

02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:50.000
in the best position to take advantage of the

02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:52.000
changing market condition the industry is facing

02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:54.000
in other words they're doing more digital stuff

02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:56.000
I believe because I think

02:06:56.000 --> 02:06:58.000
a lot of their

02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:00.000
you know a lot of franchises I mean they have franchises

02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:02.000
but there's not a ton of different franchises that they're

02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:04.000
kind of continually putting out games for

02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:06.000
well

02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:08.000
and just to say I want to address something too I see

02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:10.000
around the internet for those that are saying like

02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:12.000
you know good or that'll

02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:14.000
teach Capcom or you know

02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:16.000
Capcom deserved it or whatever

02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:18.000
like okay stop stop

02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:20.000
stop because the people being

02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:22.000
affected by these layoffs probably

02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:24.000
have nothing to do with the decisions that you don't like

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:26.000
you know that's the way

02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:28.000
these things go unfortunately is that the people that are

02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:30.000
actually getting laid off are probably pretty hard working

02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:32.000
people that are just trying to make a good game

02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:34.000
and usually these types of decisions

02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:36.000
come from high up

02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:38.000
then you can start

02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:40.000
saying that you know well maybe it's

02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:42.000
for the best or whatever so

02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:44.000
yeah I just kind of want to get that out there

02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:46.000
like don't be all like well should've

02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:48.000
made the new Mega Man game because

02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:50.000
that's

02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:52.000
I mean while that may be true

02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:54.000
that's like laughing at somebody's

02:07:54.000 --> 02:07:56.000
face when they're going through tragedy you know

02:07:56.000 --> 02:07:58.000
did you see what the new Mega Man game was going to look like

02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:00.000
remember the leaked footage that

02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:02.000
came out of the cancelled Mega Man game

02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:04.000
yeah well the 3DS

02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:06.000
one didn't look bad at all

02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:08.000
too bad not enough people

02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:10.000
downloaded the demo or wait they didn't

02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:12.000
release that no they didn't

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:14.000
so yeah but not enough people

02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:16.000
downloaded the demo because they never released it

02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:18.000
so yeah but

02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:20.000
are these layoff news about the people

02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:22.000
that made that decision probably not

02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:24.000
it's kind of the equivalent of not tipping

02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:26.000
your waitress because the food was shitty or

02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:28.000
you just didn't like it it's you know

02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:30.000
they're really they're just usually conveying

02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:32.000
it to you they have no say in it at all

02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:34.000
unless they spit in it oh yeah

02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:36.000
that would be yeah

02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:38.000
alright fair enough alright

02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:40.000
I have a story that's

02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:42.000
hopefully a little bit happier news this

02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:44.000
is something that you know

02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:46.000
ever since we saw Sony do this with

02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:48.000
the Playstation 3 and the Playstation Vita

02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:50.000
we've wondered if Nintendo

02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:52.000
might do something similar and that is cross by

02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:54.000
play which on Playstation 3

02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:56.000
is awesome because who doesn't like more

02:08:56.000 --> 02:08:58.000
games for more systems for free

02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:00.000
games like sound shapes and

02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:02.000
Zen Pinball 2 they have the

02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:04.000
cross play available or if you buy it on

02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:06.000
the Playstation 3 you get a copy for the Vita as well

02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:08.000
well it was questioned

02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:10.000
of Dan Adelman who is a manager of business

02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:12.000
development at Nintendo

02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:14.000
will there be something about cross

02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:16.000
buy and quote we don't

02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:18.000
have anything new to announce on that but

02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:20.000
I believe that the idea has been talked about

02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:22.000
so if it's something we're definitely up to

02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:24.000
considering so it's something we're

02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:26.000
definitely up to considering

02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:28.000
that's not a non-committal answer I don't know what it is

02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:30.000
if there's enough demand from developers

02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:32.000
but nothing to announce for right now

02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:34.000
so that's interesting this will work

02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:36.000
in nicely when we announce our

02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:38.000
you know the brand new technology

02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:40.000
that we're putting in place to play 3DS

02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:42.000
games on the Wii U because then you'll

02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:44.000
buy your 3DS game and play it on

02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:46.000
your Wii U or on your 3DS

02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:48.000
because that's totally gonna fucking

02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:50.000
happen someday it might

02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:52.000
it's not a might it's an inevitably

02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:54.000
it's just gonna happen

02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:56.000
and then cross buy all the things

02:09:56.000 --> 02:09:58.000
but I can see where they might make that decision

02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:00.000
leave it up to developers though

02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:02.000
a developer has a right

02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:04.000
to double dip if they want even if it

02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:06.000
you know we don't like it and don't want to

02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:08.000
support it well a lot of time also

02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:10.000
with like the 3DS and the

02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:12.000
Wii U version it's gonna be two

02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:14.000
different developers on it because you have

02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:16.000
you know developers that'll do the handheld ports

02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:18.000
of games and then you'll have the console

02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:20.000
developers doing that sometimes it's the same team

02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:22.000
but a lot of times it can be two separate teams

02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:24.000
so you know it's

02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:26.000
why would you want to give

02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:28.000
something away for free considering that they're probably

02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:30.000
selling plenty of 3DS

02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:32.000
games and they need to sell more Wii U games

02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:34.000
so I don't know

02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:36.000
uh tiger claw on chat

02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:38.000
says what if they take cross buy a step further

02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:40.000
speaking on the Sony side now

02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:42.000
buy the Playstation 4 version and you get

02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:44.000
not only the Vita version but the PS3

02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:46.000
version too well we

02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:48.000
don't know enough about the Gaikai thing it doesn't

02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:50.000
sound like it's gonna be there at launch and if it will

02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:52.000
do the Playstation 3 games

02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:54.000
so I don't think we can assume that yet but

02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:56.000
um I

02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:58.000
I don't know like why would you go

02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:00.000
back and play the Playstation 3 version if you have a

02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:02.000
Playstation 4 version maybe I'm missing something

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:04.000
but I would think the newer one would be

02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:06.000
a better experience but I mean I don't

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:08.000
know I guess I could be wrong there are people that like

02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:10.000
retro but I'm like if it's the exact same game

02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:12.000
I don't know oh well

02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:14.000
anyhow

02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:16.000
uh let's move on

02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:18.000
more gaming news Dark Sakura

02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:20.000
we do have some other gaming news

02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:22.000
we have

02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:26.000
a game that

02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:28.000
I'm not any good at

02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:30.000
my husband's pretty good at it

02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:32.000
a lot of people are bitching about this

02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:34.000
too and I'll tell you why in a second

02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:36.000
but uh Ikaruga

02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:38.000
has hit the green light so Treasure's

02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:40.000
uh wonderful

02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:42.000
shooter game is going to be

02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:44.000
out for Steam

02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:46.000
and apparently though

02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:48.000
um while it's based

02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:50.000
off the Xbox 360

02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:52.000
version it is

02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:54.000
um

02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:56.000
going to have I think some different patterns

02:11:56.000 --> 02:11:58.000
from what I understand so basically

02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:00.000
people who had the old patterns memorized will have

02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:02.000
to learn new patterns all over again

02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:04.000
um so

02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:06.000
there's also a

02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:08.000
statement that came from Treasure on Twitter

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:10.000
this is new challenge we are trying to distribute

02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:12.000
Treasure games on Steam

02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:14.000
so maybe we'll get Radiant Silver Gun next

02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:16.000
who knows

02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:20.000
it seems weird they have to go through

02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:22.000
Steam green light I mean it's Treasure

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:24.000
why can't they just put the game on Steam

02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:26.000
why did they have to go through the green light process

02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:28.000
let's I mean

02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:30.000
maybe I'm not being fair here or whatever

02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:32.000
but it just seems like you know Treasure would be

02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:34.000
a big enough name that they kind of get to

02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:36.000
cut ahead for a game like Ikaruga

02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:38.000
and maybe they're also thinking

02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:40.000
we might maybe get something like Silhouette

02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:42.000
Mirage or Troublemakers or

02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:44.000
maybe they want to see what kind of support they're getting too

02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:46.000
I think green light actually is a really

02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:48.000
good way to gauge support because you have that whole

02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:50.000
voting system so true

02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:52.000
maybe they don't want to put the effort if

02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:54.000
there's not going to be enough people clamoring

02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:56.000
for it but Ikaruga has been

02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:58.000
popular enough I would love to have

02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:00.000
an accessible home version

02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:02.000
of Radiant Silver Gun that would be

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:04.000
amazing

02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:06.000
alright let's move on

02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:08.000
so Microsoft is promising hey you know

02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:10.000
we got that brand new Kinect that's going to be

02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:12.000
coming out with the Xbox One and

02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:14.000
hey you know that they have that

02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:16.000
feature now that I guess it

02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:18.000
allows well the only thing

02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:20.000
this is really new because I think they have this for the

02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:22.000
Xbox 360 as well but it

02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:24.000
can be used in advertising

02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:26.000
like for example they're saying that

02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:28.000
Kinect actually recognizes

02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:30.000
expressions and engagement

02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:32.000
or can recognize people's faces

02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:34.000
that

02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:36.000
you know they could tell you know

02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:38.000
who's actually watching the ad or start

02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:40.000
you know targeting ads towards people and stuff

02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:42.000
and say hey listen you know

02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:44.000
just because it could be

02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:46.000
you know using that you know some of the new

02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:48.000
Xbox One Kinect fixtures

02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:50.000
could be used in advertising

02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:52.000
since we see expressions engagement

02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:54.000
etcetera and how that

02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:56.000
might be used to target advertising

02:13:56.000 --> 02:13:58.000
this is the point

02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:00.000
that seems to draw some controversy first

02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:02.000
nobody is working on that

02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:04.000
I'm not aware of any activity

02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:06.000
or any active work

02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:08.000
in this space second if something

02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:10.000
like that ever happened you can

02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:12.000
be sure that it wouldn't happen without

02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:14.000
the user having control over it period

02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:16.000
as they

02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:18.000
emphasize

02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:22.000
yeah but at the same time you know

02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:24.000
there's also all this controversy

02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:26.000
going on with the NSA and you know

02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:28.000
they're talking about people

02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:30.000
being spied on and

02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:32.000
Microsoft is the first to jump on board with

02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:34.000
supporting that kind of stuff

02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:36.000
when we first talked about the mandatory

02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:38.000
Kinect thing when all that E3

02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:40.000
shit blew up I said what a

02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:42.000
horrible time I think we all said

02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:44.000
what a horrible time for this to be happening with all the

02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:46.000
NSA stuff that's coming to light right now because that

02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:48.000
all also happened over the summer and it's like

02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:50.000
this is not going to help Microsoft's case

02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:52.000
to make the Kinect mandatory

02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:54.000
so I mean that thing needs

02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:56.000
to work and haven't they come out since

02:14:56.000 --> 02:14:58.000
it's been said it'll be fine if you unplug your Kinect

02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:00.000
they won 80 on that point didn't they

02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:02.000
yeah they did and honestly I don't see

02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:04.000
this as big a huge problem

02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:06.000
I mean because I mean I'm assuming

02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:08.000
I haven't really gotten a good peak

02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:10.000
at the interface and stuff but I'm assuming it's very

02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:12.000
similar like how the 360 is where

02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:14.000
you have those tiny little okay well there's

02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:16.000
let's be honest there's a lot of fucking ads

02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:18.000
on the 360 dashboard

02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:20.000
that really probably don't need to be there

02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:22.000
I mean come on Microsoft's been

02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:24.000
collecting money for these internet

02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:26.000
services and stuff and don't give me

02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:28.000
that oh sorry we need

02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:30.000
this extra ad revenue to you know

02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:32.000
cloud things or something I don't know

02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:34.000
whatever um

02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:36.000
but I just don't see the point that we need to

02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:38.000
have even ad people make

02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:40.000
like these interactive Kinect

02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:42.000
ads or something because who the fuck

02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:44.000
is really going to play that or actually

02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:46.000
you know half the people don't watch those ads

02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:48.000
anyways and who's going to really want

02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:50.000
to see an ad where like oh hey

02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:52.000
throw the mountain do it you know

02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:54.000
Jeff Gershman or whatever it is

02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:56.000
so I

02:15:56.000 --> 02:15:58.000
just

02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:00.000
Jason in chat says

02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:02.000
God get over the fucking NSA

02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:04.000
which you know

02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:06.000
despite all that political hub

02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:08.000
baloo it's not that

02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:10.000
honestly it's not really that that concerns me about the mandatory

02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:12.000
Kinect which is like you know the Kinect has the voice

02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:14.000
commands and everything right I just

02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:16.000
whether legit or

02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:18.000
not I am paranoid that that thing

02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:20.000
would capture a really

02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:22.000
unflattering picture in an inopportune

02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:24.000
or something or you know

02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:26.000
those things are going to be able to broadcast online and call

02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:28.000
people with voice commands and stuff so it's like

02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:30.000
hey I recognize Rob has the mountain do in front

02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:32.000
of him I'm going to take a picture look he's doing the do

02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:34.000
with underwear on

02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:38.000
the listeners thank you for that

02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:40.000
visual Loki but

02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:42.000
no for like for real like you know

02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:44.000
I'm I would my plan all along

02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:46.000
was just to turn the

02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:48.000
Kinect to face the wall when I'm not

02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:50.000
playing probably

02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:52.000
that's what I do with my current Kinect

02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:54.000
is just turn and face the TV or you know

02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:56.000
turn around the other way when I'm not playing and it's none

02:16:56.000 --> 02:16:58.000
the wiser throw a shirt on it like poltergeist

02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:00.000
right yes that's a great

02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:02.000
answer too and then the Kinect's like

02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:04.000
hello are you still there

02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:06.000
there you

02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:08.000
are

02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:10.000
advertisements

02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:12.000
you know what I think

02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:14.000
would be fun is like make one

02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:16.000
of those little room boxes out

02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:18.000
of a shoebox you know a little stick figure people

02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:20.000
and then put it in front of the box

02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:22.000
just so that that's all it sees

02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:24.000
is the stick figure

02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:26.000
room box these people are really

02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:28.000
skinny and made of popsicle

02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:30.000
sticks like put like um

02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:32.000
like Halloween full

02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:34.000
people sitting on my couch

02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:36.000
so the Kinect thinks somebody's sitting on my

02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:38.000
couch 24 hours a day 7 days a week

02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:40.000
that somebody literally died on my couch

02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:42.000
you know what you get

02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:44.000
put a blow up doll on your couch

02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:46.000
and then that's all it sees

02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:48.000
wow

02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:50.000
a hardcore pornography

02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:52.000
alright

02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:54.000
we should just put a continuous loop

02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:56.000
video of Elizabeth Berkley

02:17:56.000 --> 02:17:58.000
doing the pool scene

02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:00.000
you don't know shit

02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:02.000
of course why are there so many

02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:04.000
showgirls references tonight

02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:06.000
not that I'm complaining alright

02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:08.000
well I think a lot of people are complaining about this

02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:10.000
Half Life 3

02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:12.000
was trademarked in Europe this week

02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:14.000
that's right

02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:16.000
the office for harmonization in the internal

02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:18.000
market or whatever that is

02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:20.000
in the European Union forgive my

02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:22.000
ignorance that's just an overseas

02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:24.000
agency

02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:26.000
trademarked Half Life 3 this week being owned

02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:28.000
by Valve Corporation

02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:30.000
the trademark covers computer game software

02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:32.000
it was filed on September 29th blah

02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:34.000
blah blah blah but

02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:36.000
it was fake y'all

02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:38.000
as sometimes happens with

02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:40.000
the trademarks this

02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:42.000
was a fake it was therefore

02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:44.000
removed from the trademark

02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:46.000
it was actually a part of the actual website

02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:48.000
or whatever the

02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:50.000
entrant disappeared completely

02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:52.000
and yeah it's

02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:54.000
it's not there anymore

02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:56.000
is this what we've come down to?

02:18:56.000 --> 02:18:58.000
trolling with fake trademarks

02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:00.000
same thing happened in World of Warcraft

02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:02.000
same thing happens over there

02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:04.000
whatever

02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:06.000
you know what when Valve's ready

02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:08.000
they'll fucking say something

02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:10.000
to them

02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:12.000
it's happening soon

02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:14.000
so then you have a 1 in 300

02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:16.000
you have a

02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:18.000
300 opportunities to get a really nice PC

02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:20.000
in your house

02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:22.000
that's right that's the way I'm looking at it

02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:24.000
alright we'll see

02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:26.000
who plays Half Life 3 hey I guess that's a bonus

02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:28.000
hey Rob

02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:30.000
it's a fake

02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:32.000
yes it is

02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:34.000
alright let's get to the mailbag

02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:36.000
every week you kids email us

02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:38.000
and DarkSakura dives in the email

02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:40.000
bag head first and picks out a few of her

02:19:40.000 --> 02:19:42.000
favorite emails to read for you

02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:44.000
why do you have to tell everyone to send all those

02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:46.000
emails I know we got a lot this week

02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:48.000
thank you listeners

02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:50.000
I'm gonna be hilarious if Gabe Newell is just sitting over there

02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:52.000
he's like ah I'm gonna totally register that

02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:54.000
yep yep I just did it

02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:56.000
no I didn't hah

02:19:56.000 --> 02:19:58.000
I totally fooled all those guys

02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:00.000
it's hilarious

02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:02.000
luckily Gabe Newell is not a troll like you

02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:04.000
you don't know that

02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:06.000
so I am super excited about Beyond Two Souls

02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:08.000
I loved Heavy Rain despite its flaws

02:20:08.000 --> 02:20:10.000
and from what I've played in the demo so far

02:20:10.000 --> 02:20:12.000
this game seems to have corrected a lot of the issues

02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:14.000
people complained about in that first game

02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:16.000
I wanted to talk about playing

02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:18.000
excuse me

02:20:18.000 --> 02:20:20.000
I want to talk about playing the game via this app called Beyond Touch

02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:22.000
sounds kinky

02:20:22.000 --> 02:20:24.000
they designed the game to be fully playable

02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:26.000
without a controller at all

02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:28.000
but with an app you can download for iOS and Android

02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:30.000
if you'd like to

02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:32.000
it sounds like it's an easier way to play

02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:34.000
is it more accessible for people who aren't traditional gamers

02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:36.000
this along with marketing the game

02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:38.000
like a movie and even premiering footage

02:20:38.000 --> 02:20:40.000
of the Tribeca Film Festival

02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:42.000
make me feel like they're really trying to

02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:44.000
make the game appeal to a wider audience

02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:46.000
do you think this could backfire?

02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:48.000
I guess it depends on which experience

02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:50.000
is the better one

02:20:50.000 --> 02:20:52.000
because I can see gamers getting upset

02:20:52.000 --> 02:20:54.000
but don't they always?

02:20:54.000 --> 02:20:56.000
if the traditional controller play is inferior to the app play

02:20:56.000 --> 02:20:58.000
or is this just good business sense

02:20:58.000 --> 02:21:00.000
and would you like to see more games do this?

02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:02.000
I think it's a good idea

02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:04.000
I think gamers are going to be pissed off anyway

02:21:04.000 --> 02:21:06.000
so it doesn't matter

02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:08.000
I think the point is

02:21:08.000 --> 02:21:10.000
the bottom line, making the money

02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:12.000
making the money means selling the game

02:21:12.000 --> 02:21:14.000
selling the games makes it accessible to more people

02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:16.000
so there you go

02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:18.000
that's my thought

02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:20.000
and also making these sort of apps

02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:22.000
that work with games

02:21:22.000 --> 02:21:24.000
are basically just a way to get people

02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:26.000
to talk about said game

02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:28.000
as we just did

02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:30.000
there's a lot of MMOs too

02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:32.000
like having the Warcraft app

02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:34.000
is a great example

02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:36.000
you can actually chat to your guild mates

02:21:36.000 --> 02:21:38.000
from the Warcraft app on the phone

02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:40.000
you can actually still be in the game

02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:42.000
while you're not playing the game

02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:44.000
there's been calls to make that enrichment even stronger

02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:46.000
but even non-MMO games had it

02:21:46.000 --> 02:21:48.000
Mass Effect had that little companion app

02:21:48.000 --> 02:21:50.000
that meant you didn't have to do multiplayer

02:21:50.000 --> 02:21:52.000
which I still sometimes use

02:21:52.000 --> 02:21:54.000
it's off the store by the way

02:21:54.000 --> 02:21:56.000
it's officially gone

02:21:56.000 --> 02:21:58.000
that reminds me since

02:21:58.000 --> 02:22:00.000
Microsoft came out with this wonderful app

02:22:00.000 --> 02:22:02.000
called Smart Glass last year

02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:04.000
as part of the Xbox 360 thing

02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:06.000
it's something that's going to be included in the Xbox One

02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:08.000
have they even shown anything that

02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:10.000
uses that yet?

02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:12.000
have they shown anything that's going to

02:22:12.000 --> 02:22:14.000
I think they were talking about enhancements

02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:16.000
for Xbox One

02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:18.000
but as far as the 360 is concerned

02:22:18.000 --> 02:22:20.000
I think it's a lost cause

02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:22.000
I understand that, but I'm talking about the Xbox One

02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:24.000
have they even shown anything Smart Glass does?

02:22:24.000 --> 02:22:26.000
other than mention it, like, hey

02:22:26.000 --> 02:22:28.000
these games are going to use Smart Glass

02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:30.000
because I know we've seen stuff with Watch Dogs

02:22:30.000 --> 02:22:32.000
and stuff like that, but they have their own dedicated apps

02:22:32.000 --> 02:22:34.000
for that thing, it's not really Smart Glass

02:22:34.000 --> 02:22:36.000
it's kind of this other thing

02:22:36.000 --> 02:22:38.000
so

02:22:38.000 --> 02:22:40.000
yeah, I thought the Halo 4 Smart Glass thing

02:22:40.000 --> 02:22:42.000
was great until I was like, oh, it's just another app

02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:44.000
in the store, alright, whatever

02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:46.000
so they just kind of

02:22:46.000 --> 02:22:48.000
I think it's meant more

02:22:48.000 --> 02:22:50.000
for movies

02:22:50.000 --> 02:22:52.000
like being a second screen experience

02:22:52.000 --> 02:22:54.000
for movies and TV, but

02:22:54.000 --> 02:22:56.000
we'll see, I will admit

02:22:56.000 --> 02:22:58.000
TV on the Wii U

02:22:58.000 --> 02:23:00.000
is kind of neat, and it's a bummer

02:23:00.000 --> 02:23:02.000
more people don't use it, it's kind of a neat

02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:04.000
little second screen experience where you can kind of chat with people

02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:06.000
as big shows are happening and stuff, but

02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:08.000
it would be neat if there was something like that

02:23:08.000 --> 02:23:10.000
on Xbox, but I don't know, we'll see

02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:12.000
alright, next email

02:23:12.000 --> 02:23:14.000
yes

02:23:14.000 --> 02:23:16.000
Hey, OLR, it's your friendly neighborhood turtle

02:23:16.000 --> 02:23:18.000
I wanted to share a quick, funny story

02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:20.000
my wife was downstairs last night cooking dinner

02:23:20.000 --> 02:23:22.000
when she heard me let out a shriek

02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:24.000
as if my soul was being ripped out

02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:26.000
she ran upstairs, concerned that I had hurt myself

02:23:26.000 --> 02:23:28.000
and found me laughing at myself playing

02:23:28.000 --> 02:23:30.000
Alan Wake. I was pretty embarrassed

02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:32.000
she had a good chuckle at that

02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:34.000
sorry, I'm laughing because I'm like

02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:36.000
what does one's soul being ripped out

02:23:36.000 --> 02:23:38.000
sound like? But then I thought

02:23:38.000 --> 02:23:40.000
back earlier in the show to that Pokemon

02:23:40.000 --> 02:23:42.000
fighting video somebody linked us to

02:23:42.000 --> 02:23:44.000
and I'm like, oh, it probably sounded like that

02:23:44.000 --> 02:23:46.000
Loki, can't wait for GTA 5

02:23:46.000 --> 02:23:48.000
to come out on PC, I refused to buy it twice

02:23:48.000 --> 02:23:50.000
and then this one's to me

02:23:50.000 --> 02:23:52.000
I hope that this week you aren't sick

02:23:52.000 --> 02:23:54.000
you know what?

02:23:54.000 --> 02:23:56.000
I'm not sick all the time

02:23:56.000 --> 02:23:58.000
how are you feeling right now, you good?

02:23:58.000 --> 02:24:00.000
allergies

02:24:00.000 --> 02:24:02.000
having allergies is not the same as being sick

02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:04.000
and granted

02:24:04.000 --> 02:24:06.000
I also got stung by an asshole

02:24:06.000 --> 02:24:08.000
wasp

02:24:08.000 --> 02:24:10.000
which I'm sure Rachel will attest to

02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:12.000
I get pretty sick from

02:24:12.000 --> 02:24:14.000
waspies

02:24:14.000 --> 02:24:16.000
it was at her house

02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:18.000
keep on being fabulous

02:24:18.000 --> 02:24:20.000
will do

02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:22.000
I look forward to downloading the podcast

02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:24.000
every Monday morning so I can listen to it while working

02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:26.000
keep up the good times, your loyal turtle

02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:28.000
in Philadelphia, serious turtle

02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:30.000
next email

02:24:30.000 --> 02:24:32.000
it's nice to know I'm not the only one that screams

02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:34.000
like crazy playing scary video games

02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:36.000
but nobody's as bad as Gamet

02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:38.000
y'all, I don't know if he's still listening, I just had to

02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:40.000
rez him you know what?

02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:42.000
if a game scares me, I actually

02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:44.000
you've seen me on scary

02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:46.000
rides, I don't make a noise

02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:48.000
if I am truly freaked out

02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:50.000
or scared

02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:52.000
I freeze up, get the big eyes

02:24:52.000 --> 02:24:54.000
and I am completely unable

02:24:54.000 --> 02:24:56.000
to speak

02:24:56.000 --> 02:24:58.000
the only time I rode tower of terror

02:24:58.000 --> 02:25:00.000
I was literally mute

02:25:00.000 --> 02:25:02.000
for the next 30 minutes

02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:04.000
I could not speak

02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:06.000
note to self, get Jamie to ride

02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:08.000
tower of terror before OLR

02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:10.000
not even funny Rob

02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:12.000
oh come on, it's just a joke

02:25:12.000 --> 02:25:14.000
yeah but it's a real thing and it's horrible

02:25:14.000 --> 02:25:16.000
so I will sit through

02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:18.000
a scary movie and just like

02:25:18.000 --> 02:25:20.000
eyes wide open and won't say anything

02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:22.000
you know I'm scared if I haven't said shit

02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:26.000
next email

02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:28.000
hello OLR, although PS4 certainly has

02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:30.000
a very positive vibe about it, I was very

02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:32.000
compelled to buy a Playstation console for the first time

02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:34.000
I decided to get an Xbox One

02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:36.000
anyway, the reason might sound strange

02:25:36.000 --> 02:25:38.000
but it's Kinect that convinced me, I like

02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:40.000
the first Kinect a lot

02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:42.000
for several reasons

02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:44.000
for the first time I could play video games with everyone

02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:46.000
around me, my girlfriend likes it and she's very good at it

02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:48.000
kicking my virtual ass all the time

02:25:48.000 --> 02:25:50.000
even my dad and mom play from time to time

02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:52.000
and they never played video games before

02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:54.000
everyone likes it because it's so simple to use

02:25:54.000 --> 02:25:56.000
even more simple than

02:25:56.000 --> 02:25:58.000
Wii

02:25:58.000 --> 02:26:00.000
or PS

02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:02.000
there must be a typo, or PS Move

02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:04.000
since no buttons are used at all

02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:06.000
also Kinect is a fresh wind and gaming that is needed

02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:08.000
it's something completely different

02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:10.000
than just another

02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:12.000
standard first person shooter

02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:16.000
that's why I don't get why Kinect gets all the hate

02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:18.000
because it sucks

02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:20.000
mostly from so called hardcore gamers

02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:22.000
sure it's not perfect at all

02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:24.000
and it has to prove itself a lot more

02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:26.000
that's why Kinect 2 needs to get it right this time

02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:28.000
but I think that it's an important step forward

02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:30.000
in the general development of gaming

02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:32.000
a step of which we don't understand

02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:34.000
its importance yet

02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:36.000
a step as important as the joystick

02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:38.000
or am I giving it too much credit?

02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:40.000
yes

02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:42.000
what if Kinect becomes well used and mainstream?

02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:44.000
god I hope not

02:26:44.000 --> 02:26:46.000
what would be the next step in gaming beyond that?

02:26:46.000 --> 02:26:48.000
as always I'm very thankful for you guys making a podcast every week

02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:50.000
Fabrice from Belgium

02:26:50.000 --> 02:26:52.000
and I am super opinionated about it

02:26:52.000 --> 02:26:54.000
I don't like the Kinect

02:26:54.000 --> 02:26:56.000
I don't have fun with the Kinect

02:26:56.000 --> 02:26:58.000
I've never had fun with the Kinect

02:26:58.000 --> 02:27:00.000
if I want to play something that's going to involve

02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:02.000
me using motion

02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:04.000
I want a peripheral

02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:06.000
I want my dance pads for DDR

02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:08.000
or my maracas for samba

02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:10.000
I want something that's going to be

02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:12.000
specifically related to the game

02:27:12.000 --> 02:27:14.000
that I'm playing

02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:16.000
I hated

02:27:16.000 --> 02:27:18.000
I don't like watching myself

02:27:18.000 --> 02:27:20.000
maybe it's just a me thing

02:27:20.000 --> 02:27:22.000
but even though I had a lot of fun

02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:24.000
with Dance Masters

02:27:24.000 --> 02:27:26.000
to do Para Para

02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:28.000
I could not watch the screen

02:27:28.000 --> 02:27:30.000
if that made sense

02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:32.000
I did all the stupid Para Para dances with my eyes closed

02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:34.000
well you can also turn off your silhouettes in that game

02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:36.000
if you really want to

02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:38.000
well here's the thing about Kinect

02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:40.000
yeah I might razz on Kinect a little bit

02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:42.000
but I get that it's

02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:44.000
super accessible

02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:46.000
and that people who don't even play a lot of games

02:27:46.000 --> 02:27:48.000
will be like oh what's that dance game

02:27:48.000 --> 02:27:50.000
oh that looks kind of neat I can do that

02:27:50.000 --> 02:27:52.000
I can just move and play the game

02:27:52.000 --> 02:27:54.000
I get where it's highly accessible

02:27:54.000 --> 02:27:56.000
but for me the thing that really bothers me about Kinect

02:27:56.000 --> 02:27:58.000
is it's like the same three punchlines over and over

02:27:58.000 --> 02:28:00.000
it's dance and fitness

02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:02.000
it's

02:28:02.000 --> 02:28:04.000
or I should say it's dance games

02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:06.000
it's fitness games

02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:08.000
and once in a while other weird

02:28:08.000 --> 02:28:10.000
voice integrations and things

02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:12.000
I haven't really seen a lot of Kinect games that made me go

02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:14.000
wow this is the future of gaming

02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:16.000
a system is only as good as the games that are on it

02:28:16.000 --> 02:28:18.000
right?

02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:20.000
and I thought maybe like Child of Eden

02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:22.000
that was kind of neat but that was like one game

02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:24.000
there hasn't been a lot that I feel

02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:26.000
has really pushed gaming forward

02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:28.000
which is why it really surprised me when they said

02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:30.000
Xbox One is going to require it

02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:32.000
and I'm like oh my god

02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:34.000
but this joke is dying fast

02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:36.000
if they're going to use the Kinect

02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:38.000
they need to do Kinect plus Oculus Rift or something

02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:40.000
and maybe that would be real immersive

02:28:40.000 --> 02:28:42.000
that might be a little scary

02:28:42.000 --> 02:28:44.000
that would be lawn mower man

02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:46.000
but still

02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:48.000
I personally have very little interest in it

02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:50.000
I usually play a game

02:28:50.000 --> 02:28:52.000
because it's my relaxing thing to do

02:28:52.000 --> 02:28:54.000
I would rather go to the gym

02:28:54.000 --> 02:28:56.000
if I was going to exercise

02:28:56.000 --> 02:28:58.000
which I do anyway

02:28:58.000 --> 02:29:00.000
so what's the point?

02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:02.000
I saw a thing with the Kinect and the Oculus Rift

02:29:02.000 --> 02:29:04.000
and a stationary bike

02:29:04.000 --> 02:29:06.000
for the paperboy thing

02:29:06.000 --> 02:29:08.000
yeah I was going to say

02:29:08.000 --> 02:29:10.000
I'm pretty sure those mods are out there

02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:12.000
because if you think about it

02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:14.000
Oculus Rift, PC, Kinect

02:29:14.000 --> 02:29:16.000
they have PC devices and things

02:29:16.000 --> 02:29:18.000
or drivers and things for that too

02:29:18.000 --> 02:29:20.000
so it's out there

02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:22.000
I'm sure it's probably a pain in the butt to develop for

02:29:22.000 --> 02:29:24.000
Kinect always reminds me of

02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:26.000
it's in the book of Hitchhiker's Guide

02:29:26.000 --> 02:29:28.000
because you can't really translate this into a movie

02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:30.000
but it talks about how their society

02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:32.000
goes from push button to touch screen

02:29:32.000 --> 02:29:34.000
to Kinect like thing

02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:36.000
and it finally ends up where Zefod Beelbrox

02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:38.000
is sitting on the bridge of Heart of Gold

02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:40.000
trying to listen to music

02:29:40.000 --> 02:29:42.000
and you have to operate these systems

02:29:42.000 --> 02:29:44.000
you have to sit absolutely still

02:29:44.000 --> 02:29:46.000
because any motion towards the console

02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:48.000
whatsoever is going to trigger

02:29:48.000 --> 02:29:50.000
that to me seems like

02:29:50.000 --> 02:29:52.000
that's where we're going with this

02:29:52.000 --> 02:29:54.000
yeah I hear ya

02:29:54.000 --> 02:29:56.000
I hear ya

02:29:56.000 --> 02:29:58.000
alright so next email

02:29:58.000 --> 02:30:00.000
god we still have four emails

02:30:00.000 --> 02:30:02.000
oh my god really?

02:30:02.000 --> 02:30:04.000
Kiflom O.L.R. it's degenerate Johnny

02:30:04.000 --> 02:30:06.000
it's a GTA 5 reference ask Loki what that means

02:30:06.000 --> 02:30:08.000
okay

02:30:08.000 --> 02:30:10.000
is it wet now?

02:30:10.000 --> 02:30:12.000
Kiflom

02:30:12.000 --> 02:30:14.000
oh yeah it's the

02:30:14.000 --> 02:30:16.000
made up uh

02:30:16.000 --> 02:30:18.000
Scientology um

02:30:18.000 --> 02:30:20.000
it's what they say to each other

02:30:20.000 --> 02:30:22.000
I couldn't help but notice the argument

02:30:22.000 --> 02:30:24.000
that wasn't really an argument

02:30:24.000 --> 02:30:26.000
that Jamie Loki had last week over their taste

02:30:26.000 --> 02:30:28.000
in video games I'm often entertained

02:30:28.000 --> 02:30:30.000
by your arguments but they sometimes

02:30:30.000 --> 02:30:32.000
have a tense feel about them just an observation

02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:34.000
the beauty of interactive entertainment

02:30:34.000 --> 02:30:36.000
is that there's a variety of good games that will

02:30:36.000 --> 02:30:38.000
appeal to many but not to everyone

02:30:38.000 --> 02:30:40.000
it's for this reason why

02:30:40.000 --> 02:30:42.000
Alan doesn't play Dead Space

02:30:42.000 --> 02:30:44.000
why Bobby doesn't play shooters

02:30:44.000 --> 02:30:46.000
why Rob doesn't play Cookie Clicker

02:30:46.000 --> 02:30:48.000
that's not true

02:30:48.000 --> 02:30:50.000
personally I don't

02:30:50.000 --> 02:30:52.000
very much care for the Elder Scrolls series

02:30:52.000 --> 02:30:54.000
melee combat and the first person perspective

02:30:54.000 --> 02:30:56.000
doesn't work well for me

02:30:56.000 --> 02:30:58.000
as an individual who appreciates both game series

02:30:58.000 --> 02:31:00.000
I can see why one of the main problems between

02:31:00.000 --> 02:31:02.000
Mass Effect and GTA

02:31:02.000 --> 02:31:04.000
involves a relationship between stories and gameplay

02:31:04.000 --> 02:31:06.000
I may be generalizing here but

02:31:06.000 --> 02:31:08.000
Mass Effect's heavily involved story and dialogue

02:31:08.000 --> 02:31:10.000
often gets in the way of the stellar gameplay

02:31:10.000 --> 02:31:12.000
I know

02:31:12.000 --> 02:31:14.000
the dialogue can be skipped but

02:31:14.000 --> 02:31:16.000
some people just want to play the game

02:31:16.000 --> 02:31:18.000
the opposite can be said about GTA 5

02:31:18.000 --> 02:31:20.000
the variety of side missions and extra

02:31:20.000 --> 02:31:22.000
activities in the game

02:31:22.000 --> 02:31:24.000
can often

02:31:24.000 --> 02:31:26.000
derail a game's superbly written stories

02:31:26.000 --> 02:31:28.000
and that's what we call ooh a piece of candy

02:31:28.000 --> 02:31:30.000
factor in the end it's different

02:31:30.000 --> 02:31:32.000
strokes for different folks

02:31:32.000 --> 02:31:34.000
I didn't think it was an argument was it?

02:31:34.000 --> 02:31:36.000
there was definitely

02:31:36.000 --> 02:31:38.000
a heated discussion

02:31:38.000 --> 02:31:40.000
on last week's show but I don't

02:31:40.000 --> 02:31:42.000
think that was arguing so much as it was

02:31:42.000 --> 02:31:44.000
passionate viewpoints and

02:31:44.000 --> 02:31:46.000
don't mistake the two because

02:31:46.000 --> 02:31:48.000
hello we've been doing this show

02:31:48.000 --> 02:31:50.000
11 and a half years do you think

02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:52.000
yes we're going to get a little heated

02:31:52.000 --> 02:31:54.000
when we disagree on topics sometimes

02:31:54.000 --> 02:31:56.000
Rob I disagree with you all the time

02:31:56.000 --> 02:31:58.000
fuck off I'm just kidding

02:31:58.000 --> 02:32:00.000
you know I love you

02:32:00.000 --> 02:32:02.000
and we've been doing this a very long time

02:32:02.000 --> 02:32:04.000
so of course there's going to be opinions

02:32:04.000 --> 02:32:06.000
there's a little bit of stubbornness that comes

02:32:06.000 --> 02:32:08.000
with that passion but I think everybody here on the show

02:32:08.000 --> 02:32:10.000
is stubborn to a point

02:32:10.000 --> 02:32:12.000
yes we're very set in our ways

02:32:12.000 --> 02:32:14.000
but when there's a good

02:32:14.000 --> 02:32:16.000
viewpoint expressed

02:32:16.000 --> 02:32:18.000
I don't think any of us are beyond saying

02:32:18.000 --> 02:32:20.000
I disagree with you

02:32:20.000 --> 02:32:22.000
but I hear what you're saying

02:32:22.000 --> 02:32:24.000
yeah I got a little heated last week

02:32:24.000 --> 02:32:26.000
but there's definitely

02:32:26.000 --> 02:32:28.000
some deep rooted issues

02:32:28.000 --> 02:32:30.000
that Grand Theft Auto 5 makes us face

02:32:30.000 --> 02:32:32.000
that people are passionate about

02:32:32.000 --> 02:32:34.000
for a very good reason

02:32:34.000 --> 02:32:36.000
the next part of the email

02:32:36.000 --> 02:32:38.000
I also want to address the misconception of the

02:32:38.000 --> 02:32:40.000
GTA series having a misogynistic

02:32:40.000 --> 02:32:42.000
atmosphere even though GTA

02:32:42.000 --> 02:32:44.000
has often been littered with prostitutes and

02:32:44.000 --> 02:32:46.000
strippers the game series has had

02:32:46.000 --> 02:32:48.000
a variety of strong female characters

02:32:48.000 --> 02:32:50.000
dating back to GTA 3

02:32:50.000 --> 02:32:52.000
I'm going to go ahead and say this having a few

02:32:52.000 --> 02:32:54.000
strong female characters does not make up

02:32:54.000 --> 02:32:56.000
for misogyny just saying

02:32:56.000 --> 02:32:58.000
the one thing about the GTA

02:32:58.000 --> 02:33:00.000
series is that it plays the role

02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:02.000
of social commentator in the world we live

02:33:02.000 --> 02:33:04.000
in today i.e. life provider

02:33:04.000 --> 02:33:06.000
equals Facebook medical cocaine

02:33:06.000 --> 02:33:08.000
equals marijuana

02:33:08.000 --> 02:33:10.000
GTA 5 is no exception to this because it often

02:33:10.000 --> 02:33:12.000
has commented against our patriarchal

02:33:12.000 --> 02:33:14.000
society throughout the game

02:33:14.000 --> 02:33:16.000
even though there is yet to be

02:33:16.000 --> 02:33:18.000
a lead female character in the GTA

02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:20.000
series GTA 5 has strong female characters

02:33:20.000 --> 02:33:22.000
throughout the story one such example

02:33:22.000 --> 02:33:24.000
is

02:33:24.000 --> 02:33:26.000
I'm trying to get to this is female crew

02:33:26.000 --> 02:33:28.000
members that you can select for heists

02:33:28.000 --> 02:33:30.000
many of the

02:33:30.000 --> 02:33:32.000
most skilled crew recruits are women and they

02:33:32.000 --> 02:33:34.000
know it which is why they get a higher take from

02:33:34.000 --> 02:33:36.000
jobs than the male crew recruits

02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:38.000
not to mention GTA

02:33:38.000 --> 02:33:40.000
Online offers the option for you to be a

02:33:40.000 --> 02:33:42.000
woman with that being said maybe sometime

02:33:42.000 --> 02:33:44.000
in the future we could expect Jamie to join the

02:33:44.000 --> 02:33:46.000
VoG crew to take down the patriarchal douche bags

02:33:46.000 --> 02:33:48.000
and infest the online community I'm actually

02:33:48.000 --> 02:33:50.000
already working on something for that but more later

02:33:50.000 --> 02:33:52.000
anyways

02:33:52.000 --> 02:33:54.000
as an individual who has a significant appreciation

02:33:54.000 --> 02:33:56.000
for strong women in video games

02:33:56.000 --> 02:33:58.000
the KOTOR series Final Fantasy 12

02:33:58.000 --> 02:34:00.000
Mirrors Edge I just wanted to add in my

02:34:00.000 --> 02:34:02.000
two cents sincerely degenerate Johnny

02:34:02.000 --> 02:34:04.000
I think what my problem

02:34:04.000 --> 02:34:06.000
is more with the

02:34:06.000 --> 02:34:08.000
misogynistic presentation

02:34:08.000 --> 02:34:10.000
in the game is the fact that it

02:34:10.000 --> 02:34:12.000
is coming from

02:34:12.000 --> 02:34:14.000
real life

02:34:14.000 --> 02:34:16.000
that it's an aspect of

02:34:16.000 --> 02:34:18.000
real life that seems to be

02:34:20.000 --> 02:34:22.000
almost

02:34:22.000 --> 02:34:24.000
an ingrained part of culture

02:34:24.000 --> 02:34:26.000
that shouldn't be

02:34:26.000 --> 02:34:28.000
that we should strive to be better than

02:34:28.000 --> 02:34:30.000
I have to make a tough

02:34:30.000 --> 02:34:32.000
counterpoint though or at least I see it as one though

02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:34.000
that isn't the point of Grand Theft Auto

02:34:34.000 --> 02:34:36.000
and I kind of see it in this email too

02:34:36.000 --> 02:34:38.000
isn't the point of Grand Theft Auto to be

02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:40.000
over the top and silly

02:34:40.000 --> 02:34:42.000
and ridiculous so yes

02:34:42.000 --> 02:34:44.000
there's misogyny but it is presented

02:34:44.000 --> 02:34:46.000
very tongue in cheek that maybe

02:34:46.000 --> 02:34:48.000
people and I'm gonna

02:34:48.000 --> 02:34:50.000
use something you've said on the show before

02:34:50.000 --> 02:34:52.000
maybe people are looking to be offended

02:34:52.000 --> 02:34:54.000
is it possible?

02:34:54.000 --> 02:34:56.000
I

02:35:00.000 --> 02:35:02.000
I think

02:35:02.000 --> 02:35:04.000
it's not necessarily just a matter of looking

02:35:04.000 --> 02:35:06.000
to be offended people are going to

02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:08.000
be offended as a reaction

02:35:08.000 --> 02:35:10.000
and as I've often

02:35:10.000 --> 02:35:12.000
said not necessarily on the show

02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:14.000
but in real life

02:35:14.000 --> 02:35:16.000
you can't necessarily help

02:35:16.000 --> 02:35:18.000
a reaction you can help

02:35:18.000 --> 02:35:20.000
by acting instead of acting

02:35:20.000 --> 02:35:22.000
on your reaction so

02:35:22.000 --> 02:35:24.000
I think that the problem being

02:35:24.000 --> 02:35:26.000
is that illustrating that

02:35:26.000 --> 02:35:28.000
yeah this is a part of society

02:35:28.000 --> 02:35:30.000
the fact

02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:32.000
that it has to be something that's brought

02:35:32.000 --> 02:35:34.000
up in a game to be a realistic

02:35:34.000 --> 02:35:36.000
parody means that something that needs

02:35:36.000 --> 02:35:38.000
more attention to be combated if that

02:35:38.000 --> 02:35:40.000
makes sense. Yeah

02:35:40.000 --> 02:35:42.000
it's something to think about

02:35:42.000 --> 02:35:44.000
and I mean and you know

02:35:44.000 --> 02:35:46.000
honestly it was a big turn off for me

02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:48.000
in trying to play the game

02:35:48.000 --> 02:35:50.000
I've sat and watched a bunch

02:35:50.000 --> 02:35:52.000
of the missions in the game while Dan played because

02:35:52.000 --> 02:35:54.000
I could not touch

02:35:54.000 --> 02:35:56.000
the PS3 any time

02:35:56.000 --> 02:35:58.000
Dan was home because he was always

02:35:58.000 --> 02:36:00.000
playing that game and I watched

02:36:00.000 --> 02:36:02.000
a lot of it but after a while there's just like

02:36:02.000 --> 02:36:04.000
so much you can

02:36:04.000 --> 02:36:06.000
take before you're like

02:36:06.000 --> 02:36:08.000
wow I've hit my saturation point I

02:36:08.000 --> 02:36:10.000
feel really

02:36:10.000 --> 02:36:12.000
down

02:36:12.000 --> 02:36:14.000
you know

02:36:14.000 --> 02:36:16.000
it's a really

02:36:16.000 --> 02:36:18.000
hard thing to put a finger on because

02:36:18.000 --> 02:36:20.000
I think I'm hearing that maybe the problem

02:36:20.000 --> 02:36:22.000
is that like okay yeah the joke

02:36:22.000 --> 02:36:24.000
is funny the first 500 times

02:36:24.000 --> 02:36:26.000
yeah but there's only so much

02:36:26.000 --> 02:36:28.000
you want to hear

02:36:28.000 --> 02:36:30.000
derogatory terms being used toward women

02:36:30.000 --> 02:36:32.000
even if it's done in a parody

02:36:32.000 --> 02:36:34.000
since after a while it really does

02:36:34.000 --> 02:36:36.000
stop being funny. Chell wants to chime

02:36:36.000 --> 02:36:38.000
in here. I think this is

02:36:38.000 --> 02:36:40.000
you know if we are going along the lines of GTA

02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:42.000
as a big over the top parody is

02:36:42.000 --> 02:36:44.000
it sounds like it's kind of falling prey to

02:36:44.000 --> 02:36:46.000
Dave Chappelle syndrome where

02:36:46.000 --> 02:36:48.000
after a certain point he stopped doing the show

02:36:48.000 --> 02:36:50.000
because he realized the wrong people

02:36:50.000 --> 02:36:52.000
were laughing at his jokes because

02:36:52.000 --> 02:36:54.000
there's only so far you can go with ironic racism

02:36:54.000 --> 02:36:56.000
before it just loops around and becomes

02:36:56.000 --> 02:36:58.000
good old fashioned racism

02:36:58.000 --> 02:37:00.000
and that seems like what's

02:37:00.000 --> 02:37:02.000
happening a bit here you know the parody is getting

02:37:02.000 --> 02:37:04.000
too close to the truth and

02:37:04.000 --> 02:37:06.000
it's you know it stops

02:37:06.000 --> 02:37:08.000
being funny for some people like

02:37:08.000 --> 02:37:10.000
it's my two cents

02:37:10.000 --> 02:37:12.000
I actually fully agree with that

02:37:12.000 --> 02:37:14.000
that is

02:37:14.000 --> 02:37:16.000
on the money.

02:37:16.000 --> 02:37:18.000
Alright well in the interest of time I'm going to ask Jamie to go to the next

02:37:18.000 --> 02:37:20.000
email but keep those emails coming on

02:37:20.000 --> 02:37:22.000
this topic or tweets

02:37:22.000 --> 02:37:24.000
mailbag at orangelandradio.com or twitter.com

02:37:24.000 --> 02:37:26.000
slash o-l-r

02:37:26.000 --> 02:37:28.000
Well since Ragenator just told me to skip

02:37:28.000 --> 02:37:30.000
his email I'm skipping it

02:37:30.000 --> 02:37:32.000
sorry

02:37:32.000 --> 02:37:34.000
I don't know I might go back to it. Roll it over next week

02:37:34.000 --> 02:37:36.000
I guess. God this one's

02:37:36.000 --> 02:37:38.000
long too.

02:37:38.000 --> 02:37:40.000
No I mean it's fucking really fucking

02:37:40.000 --> 02:37:42.000
long. It's from Ralston UT

02:37:42.000 --> 02:37:44.000
oh

02:37:44.000 --> 02:37:46.000
no it's

02:37:46.000 --> 02:37:48.000
really okay I'm gonna

02:37:48.000 --> 02:37:50.000
go for it.

02:37:50.000 --> 02:37:52.000
Can we try to get a TLDR

02:37:52.000 --> 02:37:54.000
version of it?

02:37:54.000 --> 02:37:56.000
Just for time's sake. I'm gonna just read the first

02:37:56.000 --> 02:37:58.000
paragraph because it has to do with what we just

02:37:58.000 --> 02:38:00.000
talked about. Here's my suggestion you go to the next email

02:38:00.000 --> 02:38:02.000
I'll read I'll skim this email

02:38:02.000 --> 02:38:04.000
and try to pick out the key points.

02:38:04.000 --> 02:38:06.000
Hey o-l-r gang as I typically

02:38:06.000 --> 02:38:08.000
save this show for my commute 2 plus hours

02:38:08.000 --> 02:38:10.000
a day I don't have much opportunity to call

02:38:10.000 --> 02:38:12.000
into the show. I noticed that the mailbag

02:38:12.000 --> 02:38:14.000
has been fairly empty lately so

02:38:14.000 --> 02:38:16.000
I had a suggestion why not address comments

02:38:16.000 --> 02:38:18.000
from the podcast entries on the vog network page

02:38:18.000 --> 02:38:20.000
as well. By the way

02:38:20.000 --> 02:38:22.000
I'm well into my first playthrough of Mass Effect

02:38:22.000 --> 02:38:24.000
2 just in case there wasn't a requisite mention

02:38:24.000 --> 02:38:26.000
of Mass Effect elsewhere in the show.

02:38:26.000 --> 02:38:28.000
I've also been playing Dragon

02:38:28.000 --> 02:38:30.000
Fantasy Book 1 on my PS Vita which

02:38:30.000 --> 02:38:32.000
is hilariously old school 8 bit RPG

02:38:32.000 --> 02:38:34.000
in tradition of the early Dragon

02:38:34.000 --> 02:38:36.000
Quest games. Until next time

02:38:36.000 --> 02:38:38.000
John K. Critical Myth

02:38:38.000 --> 02:38:40.000
Great question from Critical Myth

02:38:40.000 --> 02:38:42.000
we do try to incorporate the

02:38:42.000 --> 02:38:44.000
vog network comics

02:38:44.000 --> 02:38:46.000
comments especially on a slower

02:38:46.000 --> 02:38:48.000
news week but we haven't done them

02:38:48.000 --> 02:38:50.000
in a while to be fair and I might actually

02:38:50.000 --> 02:38:52.000
be confusing with Horde House because I know we do

02:38:52.000 --> 02:38:54.000
vog comments more often over there but

02:38:54.000 --> 02:38:56.000
certainly I mean the thing

02:38:56.000 --> 02:38:58.000
about the vog comments I tend to

02:38:58.000 --> 02:39:00.000
just respond to them on the spot

02:39:00.000 --> 02:39:02.000
like when I see those comments I can't

02:39:02.000 --> 02:39:04.000
wait for Sunday I just have to respond

02:39:04.000 --> 02:39:06.000
on the spot so if you want to get something

02:39:06.000 --> 02:39:08.000
right away the vog comments are the

02:39:08.000 --> 02:39:10.000
place to go but if there's like a really good

02:39:10.000 --> 02:39:12.000
point or counterpoint or something

02:39:12.000 --> 02:39:14.000
brought up it's gonna come to the show

02:39:14.000 --> 02:39:16.000
one way or another. I'm gonna inevitably

02:39:16.000 --> 02:39:18.000
say yeah somebody was posting about this on vog

02:39:18.000 --> 02:39:20.000
you know. Well while you're back

02:39:20.000 --> 02:39:22.000
to scanning that one I'll read

02:39:22.000 --> 02:39:24.000
Raginator's

02:39:24.000 --> 02:39:26.000
email. Okay you got it. Since it's short

02:39:26.000 --> 02:39:28.000
Hi all this is everyone's favorite email

02:39:28.000 --> 02:39:30.000
or hero to many and a total amazing all

02:39:30.000 --> 02:39:32.000
around guy Raginator.

02:39:32.000 --> 02:39:34.000
Hey it was on the email

02:39:34.000 --> 02:39:36.000
so I said it. I just thought

02:39:36.000 --> 02:39:38.000
I'd pose a little food for thought this week

02:39:38.000 --> 02:39:40.000
it's fairly common knowledge that I've

02:39:40.000 --> 02:39:42.000
traditionally been a console gamer since 1981

02:39:42.000 --> 02:39:44.000
and it wasn't until after

02:39:44.000 --> 02:39:46.000
last year's break in my moving and the replacement

02:39:46.000 --> 02:39:48.000
of my computer where I actually started playing PC

02:39:48.000 --> 02:39:50.000
games albeit reluctantly at first

02:39:50.000 --> 02:39:52.000
as late as

02:39:52.000 --> 02:39:54.000
August 2012 I would have scoffed at the notion

02:39:54.000 --> 02:39:56.000
of PC gaming having been a console fan

02:39:56.000 --> 02:39:58.000
boy for the better part of my life.

02:39:58.000 --> 02:40:00.000
Now that I've been on Steam for a while now

02:40:00.000 --> 02:40:02.000
plus having played Diablo 2 as well

02:40:02.000 --> 02:40:04.000
I'm quite thoroughly enjoying PC gaming.

02:40:04.000 --> 02:40:06.000
I also as of late

02:40:06.000 --> 02:40:08.000
been questioning whether or not I

02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:10.000
really need to replace my PS3.

02:40:10.000 --> 02:40:12.000
That being said I'd like to pose

02:40:12.000 --> 02:40:14.000
this question. Have any of you been in a

02:40:14.000 --> 02:40:16.000
situation where you enjoyed X so much

02:40:16.000 --> 02:40:18.000
do you question whether or not to replace Y?

02:40:18.000 --> 02:40:20.000
This email has been brought to you by

02:40:20.000 --> 02:40:22.000
the clearly superior Japanese soundtrack

02:40:22.000 --> 02:40:24.000
Japanese version of the Sonic CD soundtrack

02:40:24.000 --> 02:40:26.000
the US version is just lame y'all better recognize

02:40:26.000 --> 02:40:28.000
for the record I don't think it's

02:40:28.000 --> 02:40:30.000
lame I just think the Japanese music

02:40:30.000 --> 02:40:32.000
is better. Thank you

02:40:32.000 --> 02:40:34.000
that's the same thing I say about Chrono Trigger and Super Metroid

02:40:34.000 --> 02:40:36.000
I'm like I'm not saying Chrono Trigger is bad

02:40:36.000 --> 02:40:38.000
I'm not.

02:40:38.000 --> 02:40:40.000
In fact it's better than good

02:40:40.000 --> 02:40:42.000
but it's just

02:40:42.000 --> 02:40:44.000
Super Metroid is like top tier. It's better than bad

02:40:44.000 --> 02:40:46.000
it's good? Sure.

02:40:46.000 --> 02:40:48.000
And I'm gonna say this I've never

02:40:48.000 --> 02:40:50.000
been in that situation because I

02:40:50.000 --> 02:40:52.000
mean shit I probably have

02:40:52.000 --> 02:40:54.000
just about every video game system

02:40:54.000 --> 02:40:56.000
that's worth owning.

02:40:56.000 --> 02:40:58.000
I've never been in that situation

02:40:58.000 --> 02:41:00.000
that I you know

02:41:00.000 --> 02:41:02.000
now I've had games that

02:41:02.000 --> 02:41:04.000
like for example Dragon Ball

02:41:04.000 --> 02:41:06.000
GT Final Battle when I owned that game

02:41:06.000 --> 02:41:08.000
it was worth a lot of money. I traded it for Blue Stinger

02:41:08.000 --> 02:41:10.000
I've never regretted it. Even though

02:41:10.000 --> 02:41:12.000
I can get that game any number of ways

02:41:12.000 --> 02:41:14.000
now I don't

02:41:14.000 --> 02:41:16.000
care. It's not that

02:41:16.000 --> 02:41:18.000
great of a game and I'm totally not into

02:41:18.000 --> 02:41:20.000
Dragon Ball that much anymore

02:41:20.000 --> 02:41:22.000
unless I'm like watching the old school stuff.

02:41:22.000 --> 02:41:24.000
Alright

02:41:24.000 --> 02:41:26.000
I am gonna try to tackle this email from

02:41:26.000 --> 02:41:28.000
RossDielUT and I'm gonna shorten it

02:41:28.000 --> 02:41:30.000
so I apologize to RossDielUT in that

02:41:30.000 --> 02:41:32.000
regard but it is a very long letter

02:41:32.000 --> 02:41:34.000
and we're already at 9 o'clock and we gotta wrap up

02:41:34.000 --> 02:41:36.000
we still have to get calls and wrap the show so

02:41:36.000 --> 02:41:38.000
Do you think it'd be possible we can allow it to be reposted on the forums?

02:41:38.000 --> 02:41:40.000
No I would want his permission for that so

02:41:40.000 --> 02:41:42.000
Why doesn't we ask him to post it on the forum?

02:41:42.000 --> 02:41:44.000
Yeah so but let me get

02:41:44.000 --> 02:41:46.000
some of the stuff because first it starts off with

02:41:46.000 --> 02:41:48.000
a couple paragraphs about the whole Grand Theft Auto 5

02:41:48.000 --> 02:41:50.000
thing so he says

02:41:50.000 --> 02:41:52.000
I thought it explained to Loki why the casual

02:41:52.000 --> 02:41:54.000
sexism, racism, and homo-transphobia in Grand Theft

02:41:54.000 --> 02:41:56.000
Auto 5 is offensive to people.

02:41:56.000 --> 02:41:58.000
I firmly agree that not every game needs a female

02:41:58.000 --> 02:42:00.000
lead. There's plenty of room

02:42:00.000 --> 02:42:02.000
in the space between lead character and joke

02:42:02.000 --> 02:42:04.000
character. When a group that you're in is

02:42:04.000 --> 02:42:06.000
exclusively depicted in an offensive manner

02:42:06.000 --> 02:42:08.000
that's not going to be fun. Vice City

02:42:08.000 --> 02:42:10.000
put that into focus for me as a Cuban American

02:42:10.000 --> 02:42:12.000
who went to school with more than a few Haitian

02:42:12.000 --> 02:42:14.000
American in his day. The gangs were simply identified

02:42:14.000 --> 02:42:16.000
by race and all the characters were racist

02:42:16.000 --> 02:42:18.000
cardboard cutouts. Compare that to games

02:42:18.000 --> 02:42:20.000
based around the Clancyverse. The main protagonist

02:42:20.000 --> 02:42:22.000
tends to be a white dude but women and other

02:42:22.000 --> 02:42:24.000
races are treated with respect and are never

02:42:24.000 --> 02:42:26.000
relegated to the sidelines.

02:42:26.000 --> 02:42:28.000
Both GTA and the

02:42:28.000 --> 02:42:30.000
Clancy games are plainly aimed at

02:42:30.000 --> 02:42:32.000
the male demographic but the latter does so

02:42:32.000 --> 02:42:34.000
in a manner that respects minorities and women

02:42:34.000 --> 02:42:36.000
while the former makes jokes out of them.

02:42:36.000 --> 02:42:38.000
This isn't to say Rockstar should be forbidden

02:42:38.000 --> 02:42:40.000
to do what they do. I'm a big proponent of

02:42:40.000 --> 02:42:42.000
free speech. However that free speech

02:42:42.000 --> 02:42:44.000
goes both ways and if Rockstar

02:42:44.000 --> 02:42:46.000
wants to continue to take the cardboard cutout approach

02:42:46.000 --> 02:42:48.000
to their characters and rely exclusively on

02:42:48.000 --> 02:42:50.000
negative stereotypes they should be ready to be

02:42:50.000 --> 02:42:52.000
called out on it. In fact I don't think Rockstar

02:42:52.000 --> 02:42:54.000
cares as they've been relying on cheap

02:42:54.000 --> 02:42:56.000
headline-grabbing garbage to sell Grand Theft Auto

02:42:56.000 --> 02:42:58.000
for years now. Solving the problem

02:42:58.000 --> 02:43:00.000
might lead to less sales so why stop

02:43:00.000 --> 02:43:02.000
degrading women and minorities?

02:43:02.000 --> 02:43:04.000
I think

02:43:04.000 --> 02:43:06.000
I'm a little

02:43:06.000 --> 02:43:08.000
bit with you Ross Deal UT until like your last

02:43:08.000 --> 02:43:10.000
two sentences and the reason for

02:43:10.000 --> 02:43:12.000
that is that I think you're also kind of dismissing

02:43:12.000 --> 02:43:14.000
why that quite

02:43:14.000 --> 02:43:16.000
possibly there are people that are drawn to Grand Theft Auto

02:43:16.000 --> 02:43:18.000
because it's a good game

02:43:18.000 --> 02:43:20.000
outside the story. Like I kind of think

02:43:20.000 --> 02:43:22.000
for Loki, I don't mean to put

02:43:22.000 --> 02:43:24.000
words in your mouth but I always got the sense

02:43:24.000 --> 02:43:26.000
you're an open world explorer do your

02:43:26.000 --> 02:43:28.000
own thing kind of guy. That's what you

02:43:28.000 --> 02:43:30.000
like out of Grand Theft Auto way more than

02:43:30.000 --> 02:43:32.000
the story. I would say that there's a lot more

02:43:32.000 --> 02:43:34.000
depth that's been put in place

02:43:34.000 --> 02:43:36.000
aside from Vice City

02:43:36.000 --> 02:43:38.000
what came out in 2002

02:43:38.000 --> 02:43:40.000
I mean that's

02:43:40.000 --> 02:43:42.000
you can't judge

02:43:42.000 --> 02:43:44.000
a game now like Grand Theft Auto

02:43:44.000 --> 02:43:46.000
5 based on Grand Theft Auto

02:43:46.000 --> 02:43:48.000
1 or even like

02:43:48.000 --> 02:43:50.000
some of the games that were in the early

02:43:50.000 --> 02:43:52.000
3D series

02:43:52.000 --> 02:43:54.000
3 through Vice City

02:43:54.000 --> 02:43:56.000
and that kind of stuff. It's just it's so

02:43:56.000 --> 02:43:58.000
different now that they have a lot more

02:43:58.000 --> 02:44:00.000
writing involved in the

02:44:00.000 --> 02:44:02.000
characters. It's not just hey

02:44:02.000 --> 02:44:04.000
it's this Haitian

02:44:04.000 --> 02:44:06.000
guy. He's a gang member

02:44:06.000 --> 02:44:08.000
now and stuff. There's a lot more

02:44:08.000 --> 02:44:10.000
to it unfortunately

02:44:10.000 --> 02:44:12.000
so I'm not

02:44:12.000 --> 02:44:14.000
really going to go with it. Granted

02:44:14.000 --> 02:44:16.000
some of the earlier games are probably more like that

02:44:16.000 --> 02:44:18.000
where it's like hey we've got the triads

02:44:18.000 --> 02:44:20.000
and they're going to act Chinese and oh hey we've got

02:44:20.000 --> 02:44:22.000
this gang and

02:44:22.000 --> 02:44:24.000
this nationality because

02:44:24.000 --> 02:44:26.000
they were limited in what they could do as far as

02:44:26.000 --> 02:44:28.000
looks and stuff. They couldn't

02:44:28.000 --> 02:44:30.000
get that many characters that look

02:44:30.000 --> 02:44:32.000
different. Memory. Also if I

02:44:32.000 --> 02:44:34.000
may say something he made a point

02:44:34.000 --> 02:44:36.000
though that is something that I have very

02:44:36.000 --> 02:44:38.000
recently said to my mother

02:44:38.000 --> 02:44:40.000
freedom of speech does not mean freedom from consequence

02:44:40.000 --> 02:44:42.000
and so

02:44:42.000 --> 02:44:44.000
I'm sure they had

02:44:44.000 --> 02:44:46.000
to have anticipated some fallout from it.

02:44:46.000 --> 02:44:48.000
Alrighty.

02:44:48.000 --> 02:44:50.000
Now the big bulk of the email talks

02:44:50.000 --> 02:44:52.000
about Steam Machines and

02:44:52.000 --> 02:44:54.000
kind of a bit of counter points to

02:44:54.000 --> 02:44:56.000
Steam Machines and he basically says

02:44:56.000 --> 02:44:58.000
congratulations on being one of the

02:44:58.000 --> 02:45:00.000
few podcasts that didn't declare the Steam

02:45:00.000 --> 02:45:02.000
Machine the greatest thing ever and

02:45:02.000 --> 02:45:04.000
I often find that Steam and Blizzard

02:45:04.000 --> 02:45:06.000
and Nintendo have a tendency to get away with things

02:45:06.000 --> 02:45:08.000
that other game companies would be eviscerated for

02:45:08.000 --> 02:45:10.000
and there's a double

02:45:10.000 --> 02:45:12.000
standard in gaming media and it sickens

02:45:12.000 --> 02:45:14.000
me says the email.

02:45:14.000 --> 02:45:16.000
And then he goes on a great deal to talk about Steam

02:45:16.000 --> 02:45:18.000
Machine and I'm going to apologize because this is the part I've

02:45:18.000 --> 02:45:20.000
really got to trim down for time.

02:45:20.000 --> 02:45:22.000
But basically he says

02:45:22.000 --> 02:45:24.000
A. People who don't already

02:45:24.000 --> 02:45:26.000
have PCs are not going to buy a thousand

02:45:26.000 --> 02:45:28.000
dollar hardware and two hundred dollar yearly upgrades

02:45:28.000 --> 02:45:30.000
for the privilege of being locked to a single vendor

02:45:30.000 --> 02:45:32.000
and losing all the portability and

02:45:32.000 --> 02:45:34.000
control they enjoy on consoles. I think there's

02:45:34.000 --> 02:45:36.000
a little bit of worry that

02:45:36.000 --> 02:45:38.000
the Steam Machine is not going to give you the plug and play

02:45:38.000 --> 02:45:40.000
that PCs essentially give you in the build

02:45:40.000 --> 02:45:42.000
drone PC world. You don't have that

02:45:42.000 --> 02:45:44.000
same freedom and I get that.

02:45:44.000 --> 02:45:46.000
And he kind of draws comparisons

02:45:46.000 --> 02:45:48.000
to 3DO with that as well.

02:45:48.000 --> 02:45:50.000
And then he talks

02:45:50.000 --> 02:45:52.000
about

02:45:52.000 --> 02:45:54.000
how many games

02:45:54.000 --> 02:45:56.000
sorry

02:45:56.000 --> 02:45:58.000
I'm trying to paraphrase

02:45:58.000 --> 02:46:00.000
this here. It's basically

02:46:00.000 --> 02:46:02.000
if you're

02:46:02.000 --> 02:46:04.000
invested in Steam you likely know how to

02:46:04.000 --> 02:46:06.000
get your PC working on the television

02:46:06.000 --> 02:46:08.000
which also has the bonus of allowing

02:46:08.000 --> 02:46:10.000
you to play games from anywhere not just

02:46:10.000 --> 02:46:12.000
Steam. How many games particularly

02:46:12.000 --> 02:46:14.000
games that wouldn't be god awful on any

02:46:14.000 --> 02:46:16.000
kind of controller don't come to consoles

02:46:16.000 --> 02:46:18.000
anymore. To hear PC gamers

02:46:18.000 --> 02:46:20.000
tell it much of what comes out on PC nowadays

02:46:20.000 --> 02:46:22.000
is console ports outside of a few

02:46:22.000 --> 02:46:24.000
indie outliers in Valve so

02:46:24.000 --> 02:46:26.000
that's not going to be enough to push people who aren't already

02:46:26.000 --> 02:46:28.000
in the PC space. Then he goes on

02:46:28.000 --> 02:46:30.000
to talk about the controller and

02:46:30.000 --> 02:46:32.000
you know is it really going to have

02:46:32.000 --> 02:46:34.000
everybody on board to support it

02:46:34.000 --> 02:46:36.000
and so on.

02:46:36.000 --> 02:46:38.000
Ownership of the software is another huge

02:46:38.000 --> 02:46:40.000
point. PC gamers

02:46:40.000 --> 02:46:42.000
he says have

02:46:42.000 --> 02:46:44.000
gone to Valve in force but

02:46:44.000 --> 02:46:46.000
the mainstream market isn't going to spend

02:46:46.000 --> 02:46:48.000
$60 on title they don't feel like

02:46:48.000 --> 02:46:50.000
they own. Steam

02:46:50.000 --> 02:46:52.000
has lots of sales to alleviate that but we're

02:46:52.000 --> 02:46:54.000
never going to get the point where 99 cent or $5

02:46:54.000 --> 02:46:56.000
or even $5 to $15 is the

02:46:56.000 --> 02:46:58.000
norm for new released AAA

02:46:58.000 --> 02:47:00.000
titles. Activision would laugh Valve

02:47:00.000 --> 02:47:02.000
reps right out of the office in mere suggestion

02:47:02.000 --> 02:47:04.000
of devaluing the massive call of duty money

02:47:04.000 --> 02:47:06.000
machine to get that way. But Activision

02:47:06.000 --> 02:47:08.000
I think Activision is kind of

02:47:08.000 --> 02:47:10.000
in the minor well they're not in the minority

02:47:10.000 --> 02:47:12.000
but they're them take

02:47:12.000 --> 02:47:14.000
two and

02:47:14.000 --> 02:47:16.000
EA the big three

02:47:16.000 --> 02:47:18.000
guys you know they put out some massive

02:47:18.000 --> 02:47:20.000
titles that are also on PC

02:47:20.000 --> 02:47:22.000
yeah call of duty it's still

02:47:22.000 --> 02:47:24.000
$60 on PC and

02:47:24.000 --> 02:47:26.000
that didn't used to be the case it used to be

02:47:26.000 --> 02:47:28.000
10 bucks cheaper but they for

02:47:28.000 --> 02:47:30.000
our call of duty so we can get away with

02:47:30.000 --> 02:47:32.000
that you know but that's

02:47:32.000 --> 02:47:34.000
not true for everything like NBA 2K

02:47:34.000 --> 02:47:36.000
14 is 30 bucks

02:47:36.000 --> 02:47:38.000
on PC versus

02:47:38.000 --> 02:47:40.000
60 on console and

02:47:40.000 --> 02:47:42.000
so and I think

02:47:42.000 --> 02:47:44.000
you know some of their bigger tiles yeah

02:47:44.000 --> 02:47:46.000
the price point is the

02:47:46.000 --> 02:47:48.000
same as console but

02:47:48.000 --> 02:47:50.000
you know there's also modding support with

02:47:50.000 --> 02:47:52.000
some of these games there's also

02:47:52.000 --> 02:47:54.000
you know all the different features they can get on

02:47:54.000 --> 02:47:56.000
you know PC and plus the

02:47:56.000 --> 02:47:58.000
PC retail market there's not really a

02:47:58.000 --> 02:48:00.000
big retail market anymore for PC good luck

02:48:00.000 --> 02:48:02.000
finding you know

02:48:02.000 --> 02:48:04.000
the one rack that they have a GameStop

02:48:04.000 --> 02:48:06.000
or something that has your PC product that's the

02:48:06.000 --> 02:48:08.000
biggest point I get from this

02:48:08.000 --> 02:48:10.000
email that I really want to call out and this will be the

02:48:10.000 --> 02:48:12.000
last thing I say about this email I want to read this one paragraph

02:48:12.000 --> 02:48:14.000
all this of course ignores

02:48:14.000 --> 02:48:16.000
the likely fact that these things will almost

02:48:16.000 --> 02:48:18.000
certainly not be heavily promoted by

02:48:18.000 --> 02:48:20.000
GameStop or Best Buy at least in

02:48:20.000 --> 02:48:22.000
a manner other than trade in your steam machine here

02:48:22.000 --> 02:48:24.000
both of who have very lucrative

02:48:24.000 --> 02:48:26.000
pre-owned programs that won't that they won't

02:48:26.000 --> 02:48:28.000
put in jeopardy good luck selling a box

02:48:28.000 --> 02:48:30.000
with no mainstream appeal at Walmart

02:48:30.000 --> 02:48:32.000
especially the most mostly disinterested

02:48:32.000 --> 02:48:34.000
hardware partners who aren't going to make a massive

02:48:34.000 --> 02:48:36.000
push without software compensation

02:48:36.000 --> 02:48:38.000
I do get that point

02:48:38.000 --> 02:48:40.000
and it is a good question to ask

02:48:40.000 --> 02:48:42.000
who is this for?

02:48:42.000 --> 02:48:44.000
I don't know that's the thing it's like I don't

02:48:44.000 --> 02:48:46.000
understand because if they're trying to compete

02:48:46.000 --> 02:48:48.000
like he does make a point sorry

02:48:48.000 --> 02:48:50.000
he does make a point the hardcore

02:48:50.000 --> 02:48:52.000
PC users already figured out how to

02:48:52.000 --> 02:48:54.000
hook these things up to their TV the

02:48:54.000 --> 02:48:56.000
casuals aren't going to buy something

02:48:56.000 --> 02:48:58.000
like this when there's like the consoles

02:48:58.000 --> 02:49:00.000
and other especially like at a Walmart

02:49:00.000 --> 02:49:02.000
there's lots like cheaper stuff sitting on the shelves

02:49:02.000 --> 02:49:04.000
who is this really for?

02:49:04.000 --> 02:49:06.000
I don't know because you know

02:49:06.000 --> 02:49:08.000
the thing is

02:49:08.000 --> 02:49:10.000
if they're going to compete with consoles

02:49:10.000 --> 02:49:12.000
if they compete with price I mean because this is

02:49:12.000 --> 02:49:14.000
look at we give at least I

02:49:14.000 --> 02:49:16.000
give shit to Xbox One for being $100

02:49:16.000 --> 02:49:18.000
more than the Playstation 4 but

02:49:18.000 --> 02:49:20.000
fuck a PC with a

02:49:20.000 --> 02:49:22.000
Titan graphics card

02:49:22.000 --> 02:49:24.000
it is not going to be anywhere near $500

02:49:24.000 --> 02:49:26.000
that shit's going to be like $1500

02:49:26.000 --> 02:49:28.000
alright so

02:49:28.000 --> 02:49:30.000
to give a counterpoint to

02:49:30.000 --> 02:49:32.000
Ross Deal's email let me go to our chat room at

02:49:32.000 --> 02:49:34.000
live.vognetwork.com and I think this is a good way to

02:49:34.000 --> 02:49:36.000
end it on Dungeon Buster says

02:49:36.000 --> 02:49:38.000
who says that Valve might decide to

02:49:38.000 --> 02:49:40.000
go the general retail route at all?

02:49:40.000 --> 02:49:42.000
and I think that's a good point and

02:49:42.000 --> 02:49:44.000
maybe something we need to consider that

02:49:44.000 --> 02:49:46.000
maybe the media

02:49:46.000 --> 02:49:48.000
gaming media or whatever you want to call it

02:49:48.000 --> 02:49:50.000
maybe we're making a bigger deal out of this

02:49:50.000 --> 02:49:52.000
than it really is

02:49:52.000 --> 02:49:54.000
who knows?

02:49:54.000 --> 02:49:56.000
alright let's move on

02:49:56.000 --> 02:49:58.000
lots of email tonight

02:49:58.000 --> 02:50:00.000
I fully look forward to the origins machine

02:50:00.000 --> 02:50:02.000
no thanks

02:50:02.000 --> 02:50:04.000
pass pass

02:50:04.000 --> 02:50:06.000
alright let's get to the FUs of the week

02:50:06.000 --> 02:50:08.000
where we get a little angsty on the show

02:50:08.000 --> 02:50:10.000
because

02:50:20.000 --> 02:50:22.000
um

02:50:22.000 --> 02:50:24.000
my FU goes back to

02:50:24.000 --> 02:50:26.000
the Wasp from last week

02:50:26.000 --> 02:50:28.000
because the stinger finally came out

02:50:28.000 --> 02:50:30.000
and my finger hurts a lot less now

02:50:30.000 --> 02:50:32.000
thankfully

02:50:32.000 --> 02:50:34.000
also FU to the blisters on the bottoms of my feet

02:50:34.000 --> 02:50:36.000
that are right up at the top by the toes

02:50:36.000 --> 02:50:38.000
because I was stupid

02:50:38.000 --> 02:50:40.000
I take responsibility for this

02:50:40.000 --> 02:50:42.000
I wore my Vibrams walking on concrete

02:50:42.000 --> 02:50:44.000
and I hadn't worn them in a long time

02:50:44.000 --> 02:50:46.000
so I rubbed my foot a little bit off

02:50:46.000 --> 02:50:48.000
and then FU to

02:50:48.000 --> 02:50:50.000
Wasabi the restaurant

02:50:50.000 --> 02:50:52.000
their sushi is normally very very good

02:50:52.000 --> 02:50:54.000
but they put sriracha damn near everything

02:50:54.000 --> 02:50:56.000
like

02:50:56.000 --> 02:50:58.000
thankfully it wasn't touching my food

02:50:58.000 --> 02:51:00.000
except that I think that there was some in my food

02:51:00.000 --> 02:51:02.000
I think there was some cross contamination

02:51:02.000 --> 02:51:04.000
going on because I broke out in hives

02:51:04.000 --> 02:51:06.000
and my throat swelled

02:51:06.000 --> 02:51:08.000
and I had to take lots of Benadryl when I got home

02:51:08.000 --> 02:51:10.000
so and for me

02:51:10.000 --> 02:51:12.000
my food allergies yeah they're weird

02:51:12.000 --> 02:51:14.000
but they're easily avoidable

02:51:14.000 --> 02:51:16.000
so

02:51:16.000 --> 02:51:18.000
fuck sriracha

02:51:18.000 --> 02:51:20.000
uh

02:51:20.000 --> 02:51:22.000
I guess you didn't buy into those sriracha

02:51:22.000 --> 02:51:24.000
lace chips when they were out either

02:51:24.000 --> 02:51:26.000
Dan told me that those just tasted like

02:51:26.000 --> 02:51:28.000
hot ketchup

02:51:28.000 --> 02:51:30.000
um FU to

02:51:30.000 --> 02:51:32.000
my head hurting

02:51:32.000 --> 02:51:34.000
cause I have a

02:51:34.000 --> 02:51:36.000
I think allergies cause my eyes are burning too

02:51:36.000 --> 02:51:38.000
I'll just

02:51:38.000 --> 02:51:40.000
give a quick FU to the stress of putting on

02:51:40.000 --> 02:51:42.000
a show and directing it

02:51:42.000 --> 02:51:44.000
as much as I am very proud of the

02:51:44.000 --> 02:51:46.000
people that are working very hard to do this show

02:51:46.000 --> 02:51:48.000
and I know it's gonna be great

02:51:48.000 --> 02:51:50.000
I want my free days back

02:51:50.000 --> 02:51:52.000
less stress but

02:51:52.000 --> 02:51:54.000
I've only got six more days to go it will be a kickass show

02:51:54.000 --> 02:51:56.000
it really will alright um

02:51:56.000 --> 02:51:58.000
last up Michelle

02:51:58.000 --> 02:52:00.000
uh I'd like to give an FU to Gina Gershon

02:52:00.000 --> 02:52:02.000
cause she don't know shit

02:52:02.000 --> 02:52:04.000
but she does a great

02:52:04.000 --> 02:52:06.000
Versace keep in mind

02:52:06.000 --> 02:52:08.000
she is playing Versace in a Lifetime movie

02:52:08.000 --> 02:52:10.000
just saying

02:52:10.000 --> 02:52:12.000
alright

02:52:13.000 --> 02:52:15.000
I can't believe you gave an FU to Gina Gershon

02:52:15.000 --> 02:52:17.000
I love that woman alright

02:52:17.000 --> 02:52:19.000
just a couple more stories and then we'll do some quick

02:52:19.000 --> 02:52:21.000
calls we're running a little long tonight

02:52:21.000 --> 02:52:23.000
the tech issues earlier put us back

02:52:23.000 --> 02:52:25.000
so you're not gonna have a lot of

02:52:25.000 --> 02:52:27.000
time to get through so I will

02:52:27.000 --> 02:52:29.000
put the call out in just a couple minutes here for calls

02:52:29.000 --> 02:52:31.000
but first Loki

02:52:31.000 --> 02:52:33.000
so the OUYA

02:52:33.000 --> 02:52:35.000
is coming out in European markets

02:52:35.000 --> 02:52:37.000
is anyone excited

02:52:37.000 --> 02:52:39.000
I know I'm excited

02:52:39.000 --> 02:52:41.000
Europe's excited

02:52:42.000 --> 02:52:44.000
are they who bought your OUYA

02:52:44.000 --> 02:52:46.000
was it a listener or just some random

02:52:46.000 --> 02:52:48.000
I think it's a random guy ok that's cool

02:52:48.000 --> 02:52:50.000
I'm done with it so

02:52:50.000 --> 02:52:52.000
wash my hands of that

02:52:52.000 --> 02:52:54.000
so yeah it will be coming out

02:52:54.000 --> 02:52:56.000
99 euro

02:52:56.000 --> 02:52:58.000
Germany France Italy

02:52:58.000 --> 02:53:00.000
Austria Switzerland

02:53:00.000 --> 02:53:02.000
Spain

02:53:02.000 --> 02:53:04.000
and it looks like Scandinavia

02:53:04.000 --> 02:53:06.000
Norway Denmark and

02:53:06.000 --> 02:53:08.000
oh I guess that's it

02:53:08.000 --> 02:53:10.000
late October and the

02:53:10.000 --> 02:53:12.000
distributors I guess Flashpoint and Digital Brothers

02:53:12.000 --> 02:53:14.000
will be handling the distribution duties

02:53:14.000 --> 02:53:16.000
in Western Europe while Action and PA

02:53:16.000 --> 02:53:18.000
will

02:53:18.000 --> 02:53:20.000
take Eastern Europe

02:53:20.000 --> 02:53:22.000
so

02:53:22.000 --> 02:53:24.000
hopefully

02:53:24.000 --> 02:53:26.000
hopefully

02:53:26.000 --> 02:53:28.000
the people in Europe will be luckier

02:53:28.000 --> 02:53:30.000
than the people in the US because

02:53:30.000 --> 02:53:32.000
OUYA themselves can't handle distribution for shit

02:53:32.000 --> 02:53:34.000
so handing

02:53:34.000 --> 02:53:36.000
off to somebody else might be a little bit better

02:53:36.000 --> 02:53:38.000
and I still wanna know and

02:53:38.000 --> 02:53:40.000
I'm probably gonna check this right now

02:53:40.000 --> 02:53:42.000
I wanna know if people still actually

02:53:42.000 --> 02:53:44.000
haven't gotten their Kickstarter OUYA

02:53:44.000 --> 02:53:46.000
because I think there were still some people

02:53:46.000 --> 02:53:48.000
out there that did not have their

02:53:48.000 --> 02:53:50.000
Kickstarter OUYA

02:53:50.000 --> 02:53:52.000
that's sad and such

02:53:52.000 --> 02:53:54.000
alright speaking of sad

02:53:54.000 --> 02:53:56.000
this guy has

02:53:56.000 --> 02:53:58.000
definitely left his mark on the video game universe

02:53:58.000 --> 02:54:00.000
which is funny because he wasn't necessarily

02:54:00.000 --> 02:54:02.000
a game designer but Tom

02:54:02.000 --> 02:54:04.000
Clancy passed away this week

02:54:04.000 --> 02:54:06.000
in Baltimore at age 66

02:54:06.000 --> 02:54:08.000
and if you didn't know Tom Clancy wrote

02:54:08.000 --> 02:54:10.000
books he didn't just have his name

02:54:10.000 --> 02:54:12.000
in video games

02:54:12.000 --> 02:54:14.000
he was a hell of a writer

02:54:14.000 --> 02:54:16.000
like Ghost Recon and Splinter Cell and all that

02:54:16.000 --> 02:54:18.000
but he actually wrote books and obviously

02:54:18.000 --> 02:54:20.000
these military themed novels

02:54:20.000 --> 02:54:22.000
went on to be adapted into video games

02:54:22.000 --> 02:54:24.000
and these games do very well

02:54:24.000 --> 02:54:26.000
Ghost Recon, Splinter Cell and so forth

02:54:26.000 --> 02:54:28.000
he ended up co-founding Red Storm

02:54:28.000 --> 02:54:30.000
Entertainment as a part of this and then

02:54:30.000 --> 02:54:32.000
Ubisoft bought that in August 2000

02:54:32.000 --> 02:54:34.000
and that's just been doing the games ever since

02:54:34.000 --> 02:54:36.000
the latest game Tom Clancy

02:54:36.000 --> 02:54:38.000
The Division coming out

02:54:38.000 --> 02:54:40.000
late 2014

02:54:40.000 --> 02:54:42.000
I imagine these games will still

02:54:42.000 --> 02:54:44.000
carry his name for a long time to come

02:54:44.000 --> 02:54:46.000
so rest in peace

02:54:46.000 --> 02:54:48.000
Tom Clancy that is

02:54:48.000 --> 02:54:50.000
you know that's too bad but

02:54:50.000 --> 02:54:52.000
unfortunately

02:54:52.000 --> 02:54:54.000
as time goes on

02:54:54.000 --> 02:54:56.000
people that provide

02:54:56.000 --> 02:54:58.000
our beloved entertainment pass away

02:54:58.000 --> 02:55:00.000
so take a moment to

02:55:00.000 --> 02:55:02.000
66 is pretty young

02:55:02.000 --> 02:55:04.000
that does make it

02:55:04.000 --> 02:55:06.000
all the more tragic

02:55:10.000 --> 02:55:12.000
yeah those games are very popular

02:55:12.000 --> 02:55:14.000
I'm going to be completely honest

02:55:14.000 --> 02:55:16.000
I'm not going to fake it

02:55:16.000 --> 02:55:18.000
I don't really play these games myself

02:55:18.000 --> 02:55:20.000
but I listen to other podcasters that really do

02:55:20.000 --> 02:55:22.000
enjoy these games and I get why people

02:55:22.000 --> 02:55:24.000
are really into them

02:55:24.000 --> 02:55:26.000
I think if you're into that military stuff

02:55:26.000 --> 02:55:28.000
they are a heck of a lot of fun

02:55:28.000 --> 02:55:30.000
or at least they sure sound fun

02:55:30.000 --> 02:55:32.000
that's the thing and hey

02:55:32.000 --> 02:55:34.000
actually we may be past the opportunity for that

02:55:34.000 --> 02:55:36.000
never mind that was

02:55:36.000 --> 02:55:38.000
last month I think Rainbow Six Vegas

02:55:38.000 --> 02:55:40.000
I remember was part of the free games

02:55:40.000 --> 02:55:42.000
with live so

02:55:42.000 --> 02:55:44.000
yeah

02:55:44.000 --> 02:55:46.000
Halo 3 now

02:55:46.000 --> 02:55:48.000
because you know I didn't buy

02:55:48.000 --> 02:55:50.000
that game at launch or anything

02:55:50.000 --> 02:55:52.000
I know right

02:55:52.000 --> 02:55:54.000
oh I want to say real quick

02:55:54.000 --> 02:55:56.000
as I mentioned that I think

02:55:56.000 --> 02:55:58.000
there might have been some people

02:55:58.000 --> 02:56:00.000
from the kickstart that still haven't fucking gotten

02:56:00.000 --> 02:56:02.000
their system yet and they

02:56:02.000 --> 02:56:04.000
are not too pleased by that

02:56:04.000 --> 02:56:06.000
gee I wonder why

02:56:06.000 --> 02:56:08.000
using such colorful language

02:56:08.000 --> 02:56:10.000
yeah

02:56:10.000 --> 02:56:12.000
alright

02:56:12.000 --> 02:56:14.000
we are going to go ahead and open up the skype line

but since we are cut for time I have

02:57:00.000 --> 02:57:02.000

02:57:04.000 --> 02:57:06.000
long story short

02:57:06.000 --> 02:57:08.000
we are working together with other

02:57:08.000 --> 02:57:10.000
anime gaming communities

02:57:10.000 --> 02:57:12.000
to work together we are having a fundraiser

02:57:12.000 --> 02:57:14.000
for a friend of the show

02:57:14.000 --> 02:57:16.000
I don't know if you saw me screaming

02:57:16.000 --> 02:57:18.000
this out on my facebook and my twitter

02:57:18.000 --> 02:57:20.000
but we had a friend of the show

02:57:20.000 --> 02:57:22.000
I did see this and my stupid ass

02:57:22.000 --> 02:57:24.000
forgot to retweet it because I got it while I was working

02:57:24.000 --> 02:57:26.000
but please I think this is great so please

02:57:26.000 --> 02:57:28.000

02:57:28.000 --> 02:57:30.000
alright we have an Indiegogo going called

02:57:30.000 --> 02:57:32.000
Love for Venus a charity for Kathleen

02:57:32.000 --> 02:57:34.000
long story short her and her mom

02:57:34.000 --> 02:57:36.000
and her friend were driving to

02:57:36.000 --> 02:57:38.000
AWA and there was a car

02:57:38.000 --> 02:57:40.000
accident she made it through but

02:57:40.000 --> 02:57:42.000
unfortunately her mother didn't survive

02:57:42.000 --> 02:57:44.000
the car accident so we

02:57:44.000 --> 02:57:46.000
opened up this Indiegogo fundraiser for her to help

02:57:46.000 --> 02:57:48.000
cover for medical and

02:57:48.000 --> 02:57:50.000
bereavement cause because

02:57:50.000 --> 02:57:52.000
there's various issues

02:57:52.000 --> 02:57:54.000
within the first day alone of the

02:57:54.000 --> 02:57:56.000
soft goal we hit our

02:57:56.000 --> 02:57:58.000
goal which was $500

02:57:58.000 --> 02:58:00.000
we're still going strong

02:58:00.000 --> 02:58:02.000
it's still going for the next 39

02:58:02.000 --> 02:58:04.000
days and we've raised

02:58:04.000 --> 02:58:06.000
$4850

02:58:06.000 --> 02:58:08.000
oh that is so good that is great

02:58:08.000 --> 02:58:10.000
because you know what funerals ain't free

02:58:10.000 --> 02:58:12.000
y'all and that's

02:58:12.000 --> 02:58:14.000
I mean I can't imagine what this

02:58:14.000 --> 02:58:16.000
poor girl who

02:58:16.000 --> 02:58:18.000
just lost her mother in a horrific

02:58:18.000 --> 02:58:20.000
you know accident has to be

02:58:20.000 --> 02:58:22.000
going through you know and to even

02:58:22.000 --> 02:58:24.000
like you know she's trying to pull through this thing herself

02:58:24.000 --> 02:58:26.000
it's like this is awful

02:58:26.000 --> 02:58:28.000
so I'm really glad to see the communities there and

02:58:28.000 --> 02:58:30.000
supporting and putting money where their mouth is

02:58:30.000 --> 02:58:32.000
so to speak

02:58:32.000 --> 02:58:34.000
definitely but one good thing

02:58:34.000 --> 02:58:36.000
is she is home from the hospital and

02:58:36.000 --> 02:58:38.000
we do have a Facebook page for her

02:58:38.000 --> 02:58:40.000
facebook.com slash project

02:58:40.000 --> 02:58:42.000
love Venus she we have a

02:58:42.000 --> 02:58:44.000
video up of her thanking everybody

02:58:44.000 --> 02:58:46.000
for what we've done and she's truly

02:58:46.000 --> 02:58:48.000
appreciative for it

02:58:48.000 --> 02:58:50.000
that's really great

02:58:50.000 --> 02:58:52.000
yeah you said there was one other

02:58:52.000 --> 02:58:54.000
involved in the accident her brother

02:58:54.000 --> 02:58:56.000
another friend of hers we don't

02:58:56.000 --> 02:58:58.000
know the status about her though

02:58:58.000 --> 02:59:00.000
that we don't know oh gosh okay

02:59:00.000 --> 02:59:02.000
yeah wow

02:59:02.000 --> 02:59:04.000
it's just I'm just happy

02:59:04.000 --> 02:59:06.000
that even though

02:59:06.000 --> 02:59:08.000
it just happened within the cosplay community

02:59:08.000 --> 02:59:10.000
we have people who are connected to

02:59:10.000 --> 02:59:12.000
the cosplay community anime furry

02:59:12.000 --> 02:59:14.000
gaming tabletop

02:59:14.000 --> 02:59:16.000
just running it around

02:59:16.000 --> 02:59:18.000
like a telephone just spreading the word

02:59:18.000 --> 02:59:20.000
coming together

02:59:20.000 --> 02:59:22.000
as one giant family

02:59:22.000 --> 02:59:24.000
to help one of our own

02:59:24.000 --> 02:59:26.000
and Atlanta is the place for that to happen

02:59:26.000 --> 02:59:28.000
too I saw that at Dragon Con

02:59:28.000 --> 02:59:30.000
with everybody coming together and so

02:59:30.000 --> 02:59:32.000
I'm sure anime weekend Atlanta

02:59:32.000 --> 02:59:34.000
is probably just the cool down convention

02:59:34.000 --> 02:59:36.000
from Dragon Con in some way I shouldn't say

02:59:36.000 --> 02:59:38.000
that that might be offensive to some but

02:59:38.000 --> 02:59:40.000
I don't mean it to be whatsoever

02:59:40.000 --> 02:59:42.000
because I think I had such a blast

02:59:42.000 --> 02:59:44.000
at Dragon Con I'm sure

02:59:44.000 --> 02:59:46.000
Atlanta puts on some great stuff

02:59:46.000 --> 02:59:48.000
I'll give you a hint this is how you know

02:59:48.000 --> 02:59:50.000
this is your cool down con if you're at

02:59:50.000 --> 02:59:52.000
the convention you find yourself drinking

02:59:52.000 --> 02:59:54.000
more than anything else

02:59:54.000 --> 02:59:56.000
that's your cool down con

02:59:56.000 --> 02:59:58.000
I like that

02:59:58.000 --> 03:00:00.000
we did a lot of that at Fonomy though

03:00:00.000 --> 03:00:02.000
yup

03:00:02.000 --> 03:00:04.000
I remember trying to find the one vending

03:00:04.000 --> 03:00:06.000
machine that actually had soda

03:00:06.000 --> 03:00:08.000
that wasn't horribly expensive

03:00:08.000 --> 03:00:10.000
and you were ready to attack you were

03:00:10.000 --> 03:00:12.000
ready to jump over that counter at that

03:00:12.000 --> 03:00:14.000
woman who couldn't serve us alcohol

03:00:14.000 --> 03:00:16.000
because it was clothes or something like that

03:00:16.000 --> 03:00:18.000
thank god for Pineapple Malibu

we had during part A where

our radio provider just

03:01:44.000 --> 03:01:46.000

03:01:46.000 --> 03:01:48.000
or something I don't know anyway

03:01:48.000 --> 03:01:50.000
weirdness but we do have another call coming

03:01:50.000 --> 03:01:52.000
in so let's go to it hello you're on OrangeLoungeRadio

03:01:52.000 --> 03:01:54.000
who's this? Legend Zaku here

03:01:54.000 --> 03:01:56.000
hey haven't heard from you in a while how you doing

03:01:56.000 --> 03:01:58.000
Zaku? I'm doing fine

03:01:58.000 --> 03:02:00.000
yeah I've been at my girl's place for

03:02:00.000 --> 03:02:02.000
a few weekends now but

03:02:02.000 --> 03:02:04.000
other than that it's yeah

03:02:04.000 --> 03:02:06.000
I've been missing out on O.L.R. so I'm

03:02:06.000 --> 03:02:08.000
playing catch up while she's in Europe for

03:02:08.000 --> 03:02:10.000
a few weeks alright well I suppose

03:02:10.000 --> 03:02:12.000
we can forgive

03:02:12.000 --> 03:02:14.000
this one time but what's on your mind?

03:02:14.000 --> 03:02:16.000
nothing much just

03:02:16.000 --> 03:02:18.000
trying to order on GTA V

03:02:18.000 --> 03:02:20.000
as much as I can

03:02:20.000 --> 03:02:22.000
it's been pretty much the center piece of my

03:02:22.000 --> 03:02:24.000
gaming life for

03:02:24.000 --> 03:02:26.000
the past few weeks now

03:02:26.000 --> 03:02:28.000
so what is it about this game that just makes you

03:02:28.000 --> 03:02:30.000
so crazy about it?

03:02:30.000 --> 03:02:32.000
Trevor I'm not going to spoil it

03:02:32.000 --> 03:02:34.000
but just that character alone

03:02:34.000 --> 03:02:36.000
I see Loki smiling

03:02:36.000 --> 03:02:38.000
over there so you get it

03:02:38.000 --> 03:02:40.000
mmhmm

03:02:40.000 --> 03:02:42.000
and I probably haven't

03:02:42.000 --> 03:02:44.000
even gotten through half the game

03:02:44.000 --> 03:02:46.000
and already he's already

03:02:46.000 --> 03:02:48.000
he's already proven to be the

03:02:48.000 --> 03:02:50.000
you know the

03:02:50.000 --> 03:02:52.000
batshit insane one

03:02:52.000 --> 03:02:54.000
otherwise the others are just as

03:02:54.000 --> 03:02:56.000
fucked up you know like Michael

03:02:56.000 --> 03:02:58.000
and Franklin but yeah

03:02:58.000 --> 03:03:00.000
that's what I've

03:03:00.000 --> 03:03:02.000
been doing so far and

03:03:02.000 --> 03:03:04.000
you know trying to get myself

03:03:04.000 --> 03:03:06.000
in that steam machine beta

03:03:06.000 --> 03:03:08.000
I think a lot of people are with you there

03:03:08.000 --> 03:03:10.000
good luck though I hope

03:03:10.000 --> 03:03:12.000
somebody in the O.L.R. gets one

03:03:12.000 --> 03:03:14.000
and please give us the exclusive

03:03:14.000 --> 03:03:16.000
hearts

03:03:16.000 --> 03:03:18.000
yeah I know I mean it took a while

03:03:18.000 --> 03:03:20.000
all I had to do was just like the last thing I had to do

03:03:20.000 --> 03:03:22.000
was play something with the controller

03:03:22.000 --> 03:03:24.000
which I was able to do

03:03:24.000 --> 03:03:26.000
a few days ago but other than that

03:03:26.000 --> 03:03:28.000
I'm already in

03:03:28.000 --> 03:03:30.000
what was I going to say

03:03:30.000 --> 03:03:32.000
what

03:03:32.000 --> 03:03:34.000
about Grand Theft Auto 5 online

03:03:34.000 --> 03:03:36.000
have you been dipping into that at all?

03:03:36.000 --> 03:03:38.000
haven't done that yet

03:03:38.000 --> 03:03:40.000
I guess I've made it a personal

03:03:40.000 --> 03:03:42.000
mission of mine to just

03:03:42.000 --> 03:03:44.000
wait it out as much as possible

03:03:44.000 --> 03:03:46.000
instead of having to deal with the disappointment

03:03:46.000 --> 03:03:48.000
of not getting in and speaking

03:03:48.000 --> 03:03:50.000
of which have you guys

03:03:50.000 --> 03:03:52.000
thought about creating a crew for

03:03:52.000 --> 03:03:54.000
O.L.R. in the social club?

03:03:54.000 --> 03:03:56.000
that's already happened

03:03:56.000 --> 03:03:58.000
you might have missed Loki giving it a shout out in part A

03:03:58.000 --> 03:04:00.000
but one more time Loki how can they find the

03:04:00.000 --> 03:04:02.000
VoG community club?

03:04:02.000 --> 03:04:04.000
if you go to

03:04:04.000 --> 03:04:06.000
the rockstar social club

03:04:06.000 --> 03:04:08.000
which I believe is socialclub.rockstar.com

03:04:08.000 --> 03:04:10.000
and then you can

03:04:10.000 --> 03:04:12.000
go to I think it's slash cruise

03:04:12.000 --> 03:04:14.000
slash VoG network

03:04:14.000 --> 03:04:16.000
would be how you would

03:04:16.000 --> 03:04:18.000
get to it

03:04:18.000 --> 03:04:20.000
socialclub.rockstargames.com

03:04:20.000 --> 03:04:22.000
slash cruise slash VoG network

03:04:22.000 --> 03:04:24.000
and the other option

03:04:24.000 --> 03:04:26.000
would be to also go into our forums

03:04:26.000 --> 03:04:28.000
and we have a link there too

03:04:28.000 --> 03:04:30.000
I see

03:04:30.000 --> 03:04:32.000
I guess I'll

03:04:32.000 --> 03:04:34.000
end up trying that and hopefully

03:04:34.000 --> 03:04:36.000
it won't be as

03:04:36.000 --> 03:04:38.000
try to shoot Loki a bunch for me

03:04:38.000 --> 03:04:40.000
since I don't know when I'll get in there

03:04:40.000 --> 03:04:42.000
I mean

03:04:42.000 --> 03:04:44.000
you gotta give rockstar credit

03:04:44.000 --> 03:04:46.000
given the fact that they're doing their best to try to

03:04:46.000 --> 03:04:48.000
you know, lurch this thing forward

03:04:48.000 --> 03:04:50.000
as much as possible without any false starts

03:04:50.000 --> 03:04:52.000
but then again it's like a bad

03:04:52.000 --> 03:04:54.000
week to be an IT

03:04:54.000 --> 03:04:56.000
grunt

03:04:56.000 --> 03:04:58.000
if it's not Grand Theft Auto online

03:04:58.000 --> 03:05:00.000
it's the health exchanges basically

03:05:00.000 --> 03:05:02.000
not being up

03:05:02.000 --> 03:05:04.000
so it's basically

03:05:04.000 --> 03:05:06.000
all around, there's demand for just about

03:05:06.000 --> 03:05:08.000
everything. The woes of being

03:05:08.000 --> 03:05:10.000
popular on the internet. That is

03:05:10.000 --> 03:05:12.000
true. Alright Zaku

03:05:12.000 --> 03:05:14.000
I gotta let you go, we gotta go wrap up

03:05:14.000 --> 03:05:16.000
but thank you so much for the call buddy

03:05:16.000 --> 03:05:18.000
take care, have fun shooting

03:05:18.000 --> 03:05:20.000
people in Grand Theft Auto

03:05:20.000 --> 03:05:22.000
yeah, will do

03:05:22.000 --> 03:05:24.000
stay good

03:05:24.000 --> 03:05:26.000
sadly guys I am going to close up the skyline

03:05:26.000 --> 03:05:28.000
I am so sorry, I know there were more trying to get through

03:05:28.000 --> 03:05:30.000
but we are almost to

03:05:30.000 --> 03:05:32.000
9.30 our time which for us is really late

03:05:32.000 --> 03:05:34.000
I do want to just encourage you

03:05:34.000 --> 03:05:36.000
if you do have something to say

03:05:36.000 --> 03:05:38.000
Twitter is a great place to do that

03:05:38.000 --> 03:05:40.000
twitter.com slash o-l-r or you can also email us

03:05:40.000 --> 03:05:42.000
mailbag at orange lounge radio

03:05:42.000 --> 03:05:44.000
dot com and Dark Zakra

03:05:44.000 --> 03:05:46.000
loves to read your emails

03:05:46.000 --> 03:05:48.000
speaking of

03:05:48.000 --> 03:05:50.000
tweets, I wanted to read a couple just

03:05:50.000 --> 03:05:52.000
real quick here, Tiger Claw

03:05:52.000 --> 03:05:54.000
sent us a couple, we talked about the offline

03:05:54.000 --> 03:05:56.000
SimCity one earlier so let me do this one

03:05:56.000 --> 03:05:58.000
which is Activision Blizzard

03:05:58.000 --> 03:06:00.000
turning the patent battle up

03:06:00.000 --> 03:06:02.000
a notch, I didn't even know there was

03:06:02.000 --> 03:06:04.000
a thing going on there with that

03:06:04.000 --> 03:06:06.000
trying to bring it up here

03:06:06.000 --> 03:06:08.000
let's see, this is when they got

03:06:08.000 --> 03:06:10.000
sued over worlds inc on an online

03:06:10.000 --> 03:06:12.000
game patent, Activision Blizzard is

03:06:12.000 --> 03:06:14.000
suing back over different online

03:06:14.000 --> 03:06:16.000
game patents

03:06:16.000 --> 03:06:18.000
so essentially

03:06:18.000 --> 03:06:20.000
what is the worlds game that was

03:06:20.000 --> 03:06:22.000
worlds player software was

03:06:22.000 --> 03:06:24.000
a toolkit for creating 3D

03:06:24.000 --> 03:06:26.000
multiplayer online worlds

03:06:26.000 --> 03:06:28.000
this goes all the way back to

03:06:28.000 --> 03:06:30.000
2008 when worlds did a lawsuit

03:06:30.000 --> 03:06:32.000
against NCSoft claiming

03:06:32.000 --> 03:06:34.000
City of Heroes violated its

03:06:34.000 --> 03:06:36.000
virtual space patent, it was

03:06:36.000 --> 03:06:38.000
dismissed after the two companies settled

03:06:38.000 --> 03:06:40.000
but it looks like Activision Blizzard

03:06:40.000 --> 03:06:42.000
not going to settle anytime

03:06:42.000 --> 03:06:44.000
soon and they are taking these patent guys

03:06:44.000 --> 03:06:46.000
to court

03:06:46.000 --> 03:06:48.000
I hope they can get that all sorted out

03:06:48.000 --> 03:06:50.000
I think patent laws need to be re-examined

03:06:50.000 --> 03:06:52.000
in this country myself because we hear a lot

03:06:52.000 --> 03:06:54.000
about these patent messes all the time

03:06:54.000 --> 03:06:56.000
but that's just me and that's probably

03:06:56.000 --> 03:06:58.000
for another week, there's a lot of shit in this country

03:06:58.000 --> 03:07:00.000
that needs to be fixed

03:07:00.000 --> 03:07:02.000
but unfortunately we're out of time

03:07:02.000 --> 03:07:04.000
Chell, I want to thank you so much for being here

03:07:04.000 --> 03:07:06.000
tonight, thank you, I know you didn't get to

03:07:06.000 --> 03:07:08.000
say a lot a lot outside but the

03:07:08.000 --> 03:07:10.000
stuff you did say, I had to fist bump you several

03:07:10.000 --> 03:07:12.000
times tonight so thank you for

03:07:12.000 --> 03:07:14.000
your viewpoint tonight and

03:07:14.000 --> 03:07:16.000
please come back again sometime soon

03:07:16.000 --> 03:07:18.000
Thank you so much for having me and as soon as I can

03:07:18.000 --> 03:07:20.000
Alright, anything you want to plug

03:07:20.000 --> 03:07:22.000
even if that's your friend's game again or

03:07:22.000 --> 03:07:24.000
what have you? I kind of want to plug

03:07:24.000 --> 03:07:26.000
another game too, it's

03:07:26.000 --> 03:07:28.000
also an indie game, forgot to plug it earlier

03:07:28.000 --> 03:07:30.000
it doesn't have a demo out

03:07:30.000 --> 03:07:32.000
yet but once it does I am downloading

03:07:32.000 --> 03:07:34.000
that shit, it's called Coral Cove

03:07:34.000 --> 03:07:36.000
completely traditional art

03:07:36.000 --> 03:07:38.000
illustrated and animated

03:07:38.000 --> 03:07:40.000
so cool

03:07:40.000 --> 03:07:42.000
very nice, and Gabe

03:07:42.000 --> 03:07:44.000
if you're out there listening

03:07:44.000 --> 03:07:46.000
prime candidate right here in studio

03:07:46.000 --> 03:07:48.000
hire this woman when she finishes

03:07:48.000 --> 03:07:50.000
up all her schooling, I think she'll be great

03:07:50.000 --> 03:07:52.000
alright, last

03:07:52.000 --> 03:07:54.000
but not least, we go around and we get the final thoughts

03:07:54.000 --> 03:07:56.000
I do want to say real quick though

03:07:56.000 --> 03:07:58.000
before we get the final thoughts, thank you guys

03:07:58.000 --> 03:08:00.000
so much for listening to our program

03:08:00.000 --> 03:08:02.000
supporting the show, supporting independent

03:08:02.000 --> 03:08:04.000
broadcasting, thank you for taking the time out of your

03:08:04.000 --> 03:08:06.000
day to listen to us, if you're staying up late

03:08:06.000 --> 03:08:08.000
listening to us live, thank you

03:08:08.000 --> 03:08:10.000
your support means the world

03:08:10.000 --> 03:08:12.000
all we ask if you do enjoy what you hear here at

03:08:12.000 --> 03:08:14.000
Orange Launch Radio, tell a friend or two or five

03:08:14.000 --> 03:08:16.000
about the show, and yeah

03:08:16.000 --> 03:08:18.000
help spread the word about Orange Launch Radio

03:08:18.000 --> 03:08:20.000
and we will grow our family even more

03:08:20.000 --> 03:08:22.000
don't forget about the Podcast Awards

03:08:22.000 --> 03:08:24.000
thing too, just again for your consideration

03:08:24.000 --> 03:08:26.000
we would love it if you'd take the

03:08:26.000 --> 03:08:28.000
15 seconds to go to PodcastAwards.com

03:08:28.000 --> 03:08:30.000
and nominate us for People's Choice

03:08:30.000 --> 03:08:32.000
and Best Gaming, but even if you

03:08:32.000 --> 03:08:34.000
don't choose to nominate us

03:08:34.000 --> 03:08:36.000
be sure to keep it independent

03:08:36.000 --> 03:08:38.000
because the commercial guys

03:08:38.000 --> 03:08:40.000
don't need the additional exposure

03:08:40.000 --> 03:08:42.000
they already have plenty of money

03:08:42.000 --> 03:08:44.000
let's go around and get everybody's

03:08:44.000 --> 03:08:46.000
final thought, I guess I should start with our guest

03:08:46.000 --> 03:08:48.000
Chell, do you have any final thoughts tonight?

03:08:48.000 --> 03:08:50.000
It is weird

03:08:50.000 --> 03:08:52.000
not having anybody come on me

03:08:52.000 --> 03:08:54.000
I had

03:08:54.000 --> 03:08:56.000
to do the last Showgirls reference

03:08:56.000 --> 03:08:58.000
you know I had to

03:08:58.000 --> 03:09:00.000
I like you a lot

03:09:00.000 --> 03:09:02.000
even if that quote's gonna get you into trouble

03:09:02.000 --> 03:09:04.000
Alright, Dark Sakura

03:09:04.000 --> 03:09:06.000
I don't know how you're gonna follow that, but good luck

03:09:06.000 --> 03:09:08.000
what's your final thought?

03:09:08.000 --> 03:09:10.000
I'm very irritated that

03:09:10.000 --> 03:09:12.000
Homestuck just updated and everybody

03:09:12.000 --> 03:09:14.000
is on the page and now it's 503-ing

03:09:14.000 --> 03:09:16.000
because I wanna know what the fuck

03:09:16.000 --> 03:09:18.000
happens because it was like a

03:09:18.000 --> 03:09:20.000
20 page update. God dammit

03:09:20.000 --> 03:09:22.000
hussy. Alright

03:09:22.000 --> 03:09:24.000
and my final thought is

03:09:24.000 --> 03:09:26.000
Chell, maybe you could do my

03:09:26.000 --> 03:09:28.000
nails sometime

03:09:28.000 --> 03:09:30.000
then again I'm getting a little too old

03:09:30.000 --> 03:09:32.000
for that hoary look

03:09:32.000 --> 03:09:34.000
Loki

03:09:34.000 --> 03:09:36.000
your final thought

03:09:36.000 --> 03:09:38.000
I'm disappointed that I missed the leaked

03:09:38.000 --> 03:09:40.000
Godzilla trailer. What?

03:09:40.000 --> 03:09:42.000
They're making a new Godzilla?

03:09:42.000 --> 03:09:44.000
Didn't you know? It's been all over Tumblr

03:09:44.000 --> 03:09:46.000
It's like a Matthew Broderick one, I remember that

03:09:46.000 --> 03:09:48.000
No, this one's the French President

03:09:48.000 --> 03:09:50.000
Oh, really?

03:09:50.000 --> 03:09:52.000
Interesting, alright, well, have to check that out

03:09:52.000 --> 03:09:54.000
Who thinks Matthew Broderick?

03:09:56.000 --> 03:09:58.000
He's Godzilla

03:09:58.000 --> 03:10:00.000
What happened to my career?

03:10:02.000 --> 03:10:04.000
Good things apparently

03:10:04.000 --> 03:10:06.000
Oh, Matthew Broderick, yeah

03:10:06.000 --> 03:10:08.000
Oh, yeah, no, the other guy did Breaking Bad

03:10:08.000 --> 03:10:10.000
and all that, yeah, but

03:10:10.000 --> 03:10:12.000
What happened to my career? I'm making tons of money

03:10:12.000 --> 03:10:14.000
Matthew Broderick, well, I think he went to stage

03:10:14.000 --> 03:10:16.000
I think he's done a lot with stage

03:10:16.000 --> 03:10:18.000
Election was one of my favorite movies ever

03:10:18.000 --> 03:10:20.000
That was like 13 years ago

03:10:20.000 --> 03:10:22.000
The Producers

03:10:22.000 --> 03:10:24.000
Yeah, that's true, that's why I think he's done more like stage type of stuff

03:10:24.000 --> 03:10:26.000
Alright, there we go

03:10:26.000 --> 03:10:28.000
There we go, that's it

03:10:28.000 --> 03:10:30.000
Thank you again for tuning into the show

03:10:30.000 --> 03:10:32.000
Have fun with your games, people

03:10:32.000 --> 03:10:34.000
And we will see you next time

03:10:34.000 --> 03:10:36.000
Next week we'll do it all over again

03:10:36.000 --> 03:10:38.000
Here at Orange Lounge Radio

03:10:38.000 --> 03:10:40.000
Good night

03:10:56.000 --> 03:10:58.000
See you next week

03:11:26.000 --> 03:11:28.000
