This week, Microsoft denies that Kinect gathers data for advertising.
A classic RPG series is headed to iOS and Android, and tonight we interview SoCal Mike Kennedy about Retro Magazine and its Kickstarter campaign.
All this and more begins right now.
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
This is Orange Lounge Radio here on October the 13th, 2013 with episode number 523 of our program.
My name is Rob Roberts, joining you over the next few hours to talk about video games, gaming culture, and so on and so on with my co-hosts.
Say hello first off to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
I just thought you were channeling Bea Arthur like you said earlier.
I am a little bit.
I have the raspy voice going on today.
Those of you that follow VOG Network know that Jessica from Understation Live and I were both involved with a production here in Sacramento at the Rocky Horror Picture Show.
Well, that occurred last night and I'm proud to say we sold out.
It was 500 plus seats and the cast did an amazing job.
But I was the host or MC hosting the whole thing and that involved a lot of screaming.
MC Rob, give me an R, give me an R, you know the whole thing at the top of my voice and you know trying to be funny improv and all that but it was great and I will say by missing the show you missed this really I can't even repeat it but it had to do with Pokemon that's all I'm gonna say let's just say I probably keep in mind that the shows that I've had the most fun at were the ones where I did crew stuff
Oh, yeah, yeah.
I remember you used to do tech-related things.
Didn't you play Dr. Scott one time?
I was Dr. Scott one time.
And I was the curtain and the rope, and I held the tank up.
Last night, I played Dr. Scott.
I actually played Eddie.
That was the first time I played Eddie for about... Oh, God, it's probably been like 12 years since I played Eddie.
But, yeah, good old meatloaf.
Yeah.
All right.
But I still think it's ironic that in the original production that he was Dr. Scott and not...
He was both.
Well, he was both at one point, and that's why a lot of movie shadow casts will do both, especially if they're stretched for people like we were.
But no, I have more fun when I'm not looking at the crowd when they're behind me, and I'm not looking at a sea of people.
See, the crowd thing doesn't bother me at all.
That's just, I guess that's just part of my, like, you know, how I'm wired.
Like, you know, I'm able to do, well, this is easy.
You are an attention whore.
This is easy because we don't, yeah, but you make it sound like I'm like self-centered or something like that too.
And I really like to think I'm not.
Some people are fine with the public speaking thing.
And it's not that I have a problem with public speaking, although I actually have a pathological fear of microphones and public speaking.
Yet here you are.
No, microphones and public speaking as in in front of a crowd with a microphone.
Okay.
I hate the way my voice sounds amplified.
Oh, hearing the echo and all that.
Exactly.
I don't even like listening to myself in recordings.
So I actually have to practice modulating my voice.
Well, my voice is definitely being modulated tonight.
Well, I'm running on four hours of sleep because apparently the insomnia creature decided to bitch slap me.
And I woke up at like...
TechmasterLoki
Yeah.
Hey, how you doing, Loki?
I'm doing alright.
Yeah?
Did you do any theater productions this weekend?
Have you ever been involved with theater?
You don't really strike me as the type, but maybe like in high school.
Aside from like a drama class in high school, no.
Not really.
I had to choose in high school.
I could take drama or I could take band.
And I'm gonna be honest, I felt kind of guilted by my parents into doing band because it was like, Oh, Rob, your dead grandpa left you this clarinet and, you know, he would be really proud of you if you would go into band.
Yeah.
Rob, butt, butt, band nerd represent I played clarinet
but I if I was left to the choice it's not what I would have picked but I don't regret it at all the only thing that's kind of sad about it is that since I graduated high school I have not touched the clarinet at all I have not played the clarinet since the day I was 18 and graduated high school
I told you what happened to my saxophone, didn't I?
Mm-mm.
It was in, when I moved out here, I had to leave it behind, so I loaned it to my friend who was a music major.
Really?
So she could take the saxophone class.
Mm-hmm.
And, because I played saxophone, I played contralto clarinet, I played alto clarinet, I played damn near everything that was saxophone or clarinet.
Mm-hmm.
And she left it, when she moved to Germany, she left it in her mother's attic in Diberville, Mississippi.
Mm-hmm.
And then this hurricane named Katrina came in and stole her roof.
Oh.
And my saxophone.
Oh, not good.
The end.
Not good.
Hey, how about that?
Loki was trying to talk about his life and we made it about us.
How representative of Orange Lounge Radio.
The only way I'd ever want to learn to play the saxophone is just, and really only just a small part would be just to learn how to play the chord for Epic Sax Man and just do that.
Because that's all you really need to know anyways.
So that's it.
I did, by the way, find a video clip on Tumblr of a guy going in shirtless on a skateboard playing Careless Whisper on a saxophone.
Nice.
All right, going to our chat room because, you know, we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.
at the voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.
We are live right after the Bobby Blackwolf show, and we love interacting with our listeners.
We do call it the show where every gamer has a voice, and Ragenator, using his voice to poke fun a little bit, saying, but Sky, did you go to Bandcamp and tell stories that began with this one time at Bandcamp?
Okay, so, I mean, that movie really just, like, worked that line to death.
But Bandcamp is a real thing, for those of you that didn't do Bandcamp.
But it's not like that.
No, well, okay.
No, no, no, no, no.
We didn't have a camp.
Yeah, we didn't like go off into the woods or anything.
It was go to school for eight hours a day so you can get a jump on learning your field show.
And memorize your music.
And for me in Alabama, it's march in the humid with mosquitoes and lose your shoes in the swamp that we had to practice in.
We would stay overnight one of the nights.
It would usually be a Friday, Saturday, Sunday and we would stay overnight at the school on a Saturday and sleep in the gymnasium because we were supposed to be learning about what it's like when the band goes out on tour.
Mind you, we did the overnight thing on tour once my junior year and we stayed in a Motel 6 or whatever the Canadian version of Motel 6 is.
Some, you know, Maple Room 6.
No, I'm kidding.
I don't know what it was called up there.
Some discount chain in Canada is where we stayed, right?
We never did that shit.
Well, okay, but here's the thing.
Like, at band camp, you put a bunch of, like, horny-ass teenagers in high school together in a group and have them staying overnight.
Yes, some dumb things, dumb, stupid teenager things are gonna happen, and yes, there were games of truth.
That goes for all camp, too.
I mean, seriously.
Yeah, I mean, exactly.
That's not unique to band.
That's any mixed-gender camp, or really, same-gender camp, too, so...
DarkSakura and I, big old band nerds.
What kind of kid were you in high school, Logie?
In high school?
Yeah.
I do pretty much the same stuff in high school I do now.
Seriously.
Except now you have a wife and kid.
Yeah.
I mean, let's see.
In high school, well, I took art all four years in high school, and then one year I took drama as well.
But let's see.
My art class, like, at one point I actually had a free period, so I ended up going into my art class and landing the PCs together and playing games on that.
Of course, it was Red Alert or Duke Nukem 3D.
and then um I used to bring my PlayStation 1 to uh that was actually I think I got my PlayStation 197 oh my god I feel old and so um yeah I used to bring that to school and you play during lunch and I still do that now I bring my systems to work and I play during lunch
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Tank Wars, VGA, Scorched Earth
Worms is kind of like taking a bite out of that same genre, like Scorched Earth and all that.
But for me, nothing will ever match the mega nuke in Scorched Earth.
That was always fun to watch one of your friends fire that thing off and swallow up seven tanks whole.
See, you're like... I think you and I would have been buds.
My senior year of high school, we had someone bring one of those generator-powered TVs and a Super Nintendo because that's what was new at the time.
It was Super Nintendo.
Yeah.
And... Okay, Grandma, tell us more stories.
But it was when I moved into the dorm, because I was the only one in our block that had a TV in the dorm room, that my roommate's boyfriend left his PlayStation over.
We played a lot of Toshinden, and my room was very popular.
Yeah, in college... We also watched a lot of Sailor Moon.
In college, I had a Super Nintendo with Super Mario Kart, and it's the only reason most of those kids wanted to talk to me.
So...
I also had like VHS copies of like the entire run of Ronin Warriors on VHS because I stayed up to tape them every day.
Nice.
So my room was like Anime Central and I had all of like I had Ranma Project fan subs.
That's awesome.
And I had an unsubbed copy of Rotsukidoji.
So we would make up our own dialogue to it.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Just names out there in the industry to kind of freelance for this.
So excited to talk to Mike about that project.
And that'll be in about 10 minutes here live.
If you do want to join us in our chat room, live.vognetwork.com is the place to be.
Before I get into gaming weeks, I had another kickoff topic I wanted to talk about quickly.
I wanted to talk about loaning games out and experiences that you guys have had with loaning out games and loaning out systems and maybe the good or the bad experience because I have a really funny story.
The listeners may not be aware of this, but somebody from Orange Lounge Radio has passed from the first few years of the show.
You might remember a gal who used to come on the show an awful lot named Rice Princess.
Back when Orange Lounge Radio was a station way back in the day on Life 365, I co-hosted a show with her called Outside the Box.
And now she just goes by Princess Irene, I believe, is like her new preferred handle.
Princess Irene got married on Thursday, and her and Silent Nathan, another name from the past, they got married finally this past week.
So congratulations and our well wishes to them, and I'm sure many of the listeners, especially the old school ones when they hear those names, will be excited to hear that they got hitched.
Well, guess what?
Princess Irene went on a honeymoon to Japan.
Perfect nerd honeymoon with her new husband, right?
Oh, man, I'm jealous.
I know, right?
I'm kind of jealous, too.
So they went to Japan, and she actually asked me.
She said, hey, Rob, remember a long time ago you said I could borrow your 3DS to play Animal Crossing at some point?
She's like, would it be possible to do that now?
Because I got a 12-hour flight to Japan, and that would be a great way to pass the time.
And I said, oh, sure.
So she came over Wednesday night.
We caught up a little bit.
I gave her my 3DS, and on she went.
Or 2DS.
Or 2DS.
He actually said, yeah, 2DS would be a good idea too.
And I'm like, Shane, that's money.
That's like $180.
We were talking like $20 maybe, but that's like a whole other system.
So I'm currently having to sit and wait, and I'm missing the Pokemon boat because I loaned out my 3DS.
Now look, I don't regret it because Irene obviously loved her to bits, and if I can bring a little more entertainment to her honeymoon, then so be it.
But it's just kind of one of those things where I was like, don't.
That's too bad, but you know what?
You can turn this upside, or turn this back around.
Because the Grand Theft Auto V ship has made port.
And guess what?
It's available right now for you to go get and play.
So Salesman Loki is going to counter Salesman Shane by saying, hey, do you know for a third of the price...
of the 3DS, you could be playing Grand Theft Auto 5 in the VOG Club right now.
Or Rob.
What?
You could go the free route and play Borderlands 2 with me.
Yeah, play the games I already have, right?
Yeah.
How about being frugal?
Let's hear it for fiscal responsibility.
Alright, going to our chat room for some comments at live.vognetwork.com Bobby Blackwolf says, Irene deserves your 3DS more than you deserve Pokemon.
Hey, shut up.
Alpha Cananogram says, Sky, maybe she'll get you some Japanese street passes.
I actually told her because if there weren't chargers on the plane, I told her to turn the Wi-Fi off so that way she would save battery power would probably be the smart thing to do.
Do they even have the same plugs in Japan that we have here?
No.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
if you haven't learned in the past 11 and a half years sometimes things come out of my mouth before I really think them through, DarkSakura the one who had to have the mod the little plug mod was Jessica because of her APS2 that had the different plug on it Bobby, I would totally have played Borderlands 2 with you I've had my character ready to go for the longest time and no one's been playing
DarkSakura, way to go
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
or you keep their stuff forever like my dance pad that you had for like a year it's fine if I really missed it I would ask for it back well it's like it's how I got my copy of Chrono Trigger my friend loaned it to me he moved to a Spanish fort and then I moved to California oops oops he hasn't asked for it back so it's fine didn't you get his save file is still on there
DarkSakura,
We went to Anime Expo.
She owed us $100 for her part of the room and the trip.
Oh, okay.
It was an exchange.
She went to Japan to go visit her family.
Came back with Dracula X for us.
She already had two copies.
Got it.
I thought that was like a loaning story.
Okay, but that was exchanged for convention space.
I got you.
That was trade for goods.
I don't know.
I loan out my games all the time and I forget I loan people stuff.
Right now, I don't think I have anything loaned out, but...
I could very well.
Okay, I have another hilarious loaning somebody a game story.
Okay, so Flaco Jones, I think it was, and I'm sorry if I'm calling you out and it wasn't really you.
I loaned him a copy of Silent Hill 4 The Room on Xbox.
At least I think it was him.
And it got passed back.
I know you had it for forever.
I had it for a while.
And then I loaned it to... I think it was Flog.
It might have been Extover, though.
It was one of them.
And they gave it back to Irene because they were like, well, Irene's going to see you next before I do.
And so, funny enough, when's the next time I see Irene?
When we're all at a party.
And then...
They give me the game back and I'm like, yay, here's my game back.
I can go take this home and not play it because like my original Xbox is like in storage at this point.
I don't even, I mean, I guess it's backwards compatible on 360, but let's be real.
I don't have like an anchoring to play Silent Hill 4 The Room anytime soon.
So what did I do, guys?
I left the game at the party.
I didn't even bring it home.
I'm pretty sure that game has been sold by this point.
So this is funny.
You can borrow mine if ever you want to play it.
Now that I actually have it.
I don't really like, like if I was going to go back and play a Silent Hill game, I think I'd go play 2 or 3.
I loaned actually my 3 to my friend Carly.
You remember, you've met Carly, haven't you?
The one who says the best rendition of the C-bomb ever.
Oh my.
She makes it sound like it's fucking poetry.
But at any rate, she had my Silent Hill 3 for a long time and I think I have it back.
I don't know.
Yeah, usually it's people that I will... Julie has borrowed stuff of mine and never given it back.
And then she'll say, oh, that was mine.
I bought that.
No, that was not yours.
Here's the fucking receipt.
I like that you're calling people out here on the show.
She's not listening though, right?
No, she's not listening.
DarkSakura
Okay, well, I played Mass Effect 3 because Tiara started playing Mass Effect.
And I was like, oh, Mass Effect.
So I started playing and spent more time screen capping than playing the game.
And then I played Animal Crossing.
I played a lot of Animal Crossing because I'm trying to get my tan back.
And...
I've played Fractal and I've played Final Fantasy XIV, which I still play at the same time so I can run dungeons.
And then a lot, a lot of Bejeweled on my phone.
On your phone?
On my phone.
Is that the Blitz version where you try to do it?
No, I don't play Blitz.
Oh, okay.
I play the stupid Butterfly mode and Diamond Mine mode.
What is Butterfly?
I'm so out of the loop.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
Alright, is that it for your gaming week?
Yes Alright, well before we get to Loki's gaming week We're going to cut in here because it's about that time We are going to go to the phones right now And talk to Mike Kennedy He is with Retro Which is a Kickstarter that's going on right now For a throwback video game magazine As in like a print magazine And let's see if we get him on the line Hi Mike, you there?
I'm here.
How's it going?
Good.
Welcome to Orange Lounge Radio.
How are you?
I'm doing great.
Thanks for having me on.
No problem whatsoever.
So tell us a little bit about your Kickstarter.
You're behind this Kickstarter for a new magazine, Retro, right?
Yeah, yeah.
This is something that has come about pretty quick.
I've actually had the idea of adding content to a gaming auction site that I've run called Game Gavel for about, I don't know, maybe two years now.
Mm-hmm.
and we originally were bringing on some writers and we were doing just online content, kind of an editorial side of the website.
And then one of my writers said, Mike, have you ever thought about doing a digital magazine?
And I thought, well, hell no, I've never really thought about doing a digital magazine.
Only because I've never, I mean, personally, I don't have digital magazines on my iPad and I don't know how many people really do.
But we're hoping, obviously, that it's something that people are doing more and more of.
But then I got the idea after hooking up with another guy, Mark Kaminski, who's our layout and design guy.
He said, let's go for it.
Let's do it both.
Let's do print and digital.
And this was maybe two and a half weeks ago, maybe three weeks ago, TOPS.
And since he's come on board, he works for just this really large media company, and he does magazine layout and design for tons of other magazines.
and he basically wanted to contribute to the project and just basically came on board and has just really, I just have to say kicked ass because he designed that video force that we're using on the Kickstarter page.
He designed kind of a preview layout of the magazine and he's just kind of done this all really, really fast.
So he was sort of the missing link in the idea of doing whether it was a digital or a print magazine.
So this...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Not only writers from maybe the past five to ten years, but going back and really digging deep into the history of video game journalism and going out and just kind of recruiting.
Right now we've got over three decades of video game journalists.
So no matter...
You know, when anybody kind of grew up gaming or what your decade of gaming was, whether it was the, you know, late 70s, early to mid 80s, the 90s or today, you're probably going to recognize some of the contributors that we're going to have on the magazine.
So I had to assemble this team really in about a week's time, you know.
I called Jeremy Parrish and I go, Jeremy, you know, gave me tons and tons of great information about, you know, compensation, you know, in this day and age and what you kind of need to pay.
Right.
And...
And I've got quite a few connections in the industry already, just running Game Gavel for the last six years and kind of living in Southern California, kind of the hotbed of developer and publisher activity.
I've got a lot of friends that are developers and publishing executives and stuff like that.
It just sort of, the plans just sort of aligned very quickly on this thing, and I was able to assemble pretty much kind of a who's who of gaming journalists to bring them in on this, and lo and behold, everybody thought it was a great idea.
In fact, a lot of them said that they've all had ideas for doing something like this, but just never done it yet.
So it's kind of one of those, it almost sounds like it's like, I don't know, like they bring in everything together, like the Voltron or something of these writers.
And that's why I expressed surprise a minute ago is that, wow, this thing's only three weeks old because, you know, you go over to the Kickstarter page and I'm scrolling and scrolling and scrolling and scrolling.
and it's, you know, this big list of people and I'm like, wow, you got your little Team America together, well, Team Worldwide, really, together in like three weeks.
That's pretty stunning.
I didn't really make it through the bottom of the page because I stopped to look at Sean Baby's hair and I was just like, what is going on there?
I don't understand this.
I don't either.
You know, I met him for the first time.
We were at the Portland Retro Gaming Expo last weekend, and he was up there, and we've been talking on the phone a lot.
But yeah, he's basically, that's pretty much it, you know, and I think he'll, sometimes that little mohawk's green and fluorescent green, sometimes it's orange.
I'm very jealous of him that it's not falling out because when you dye your hair that much, that's what's supposed to be happening.
But anyway, if you guys have a question for Mike with Retro Magazine Kickstarter, you can ask that live here in our chat room, live.vognetwork.com.
DarkSakura, I know you're dying to say something here because you've been studying print for a while.
This has to be tickling you, this whole idea, right?
Well, you had me at print.
I love the smell of CMYK fumes in the morning.
That's right.
I actually am a print designer.
How are you?
And I actually have just recently gone into contract writing.
Nice.
As in writing by contract.
Really?
Yes, I have.
So I find the whole thing just very fascinating.
I was wondering though where you happen to get other bits of inspiration from because I know that in the UK there's Retro Gamer.
Right.
Right now.
Yep.
Yeah, no, that's a great magazine.
I mean, if we can put together something half as good as that, I'd love it.
The thing that's so great about their magazine is they pack so much into it, and they throw it all together.
and like every spread every like you know two page spread will have like 10 different stories going on but yet they make it work you know what I mean and every time you read that magazine you see something new it doesn't matter how many times you pick it up or you know how old the magazine is I mean you're reading through it and you're like god I don't remember reading this you know the other 20 times I've flipped through the pages you know
Their design is so clever.
So I was thinking, I've thought for a while that we could use something like that geared toward a North American audience.
Because some of the machines they cover over there, we never got out over here.
But are you also planning on including some of the old import market?
Yeah, I tell you what, since we've launched the Kickstarter campaign, we have had...
Some great writers from around the world contact us and want to be a part of this.
Also in the US.
I mean, that's why this list keeps growing.
I mean, when I first started out with this, I had like Jeremy, Sean, Kat.
You know, we went after Bob Mackie.
Of course, the doors opened to him, but he had some other things that might get in the way, he thought.
And a few others.
So I had like maybe 10 to 12 people.
And I think now we've grown to like over 20 people.
because people just want to be a part of this.
It's almost like they're not doing it for the money, of course, because right now it's so segmented.
We have so many people.
It's not like any one of them is going to be submitting so many things.
A lot of these people are going to be submitting maybe one or two columns.
that are recurring, while we have others that might do a feature article, an interview if we want them to do that, or some assignment-type work.
But yeah, to answer the question, we've had a couple of folks in Japan send me some of their work, and they're journalists and podcasters over there.
We've had someone in the UK.
We had somebody in Germany.
And the deal is, I mean, I'm basically...
We'd love to have import information in here, whether it's current gen or retro and classic information, because those areas had huge influences, even on the gaming here in the United States.
And it's sort of like, I don't know what your first introduction was to Japanese gaming, but the TurboGrafx for me when I was little was sort of that strange, mystical console that played Japanese games.
And then I guess the Neo Geo kind of came in and
I guess maybe right after that or pretty damn near about the same time, I guess.
But, you know, it's always just weird.
And seeing these games, you know, was just totally, you know, mind-blowing to see what they were doing over there.
So there's some great history there.
And we really want to cover all the bases in retro.
I mean, you know, all the bases.
So that personally makes me happy.
I guess you could imagine my delight when I married someone who had a turbo duo and an EOGO.
Oh, yeah.
I always like to ask this question of Kickstarter folks when they come on the show.
You have this Kickstarter behind the campaign.
I think it's kind of obvious that the money is probably being raised because you actually have to print the magazine.
That doesn't come for free.
But what is it you're specifically raising the money to do in this process?
mainly actually paying the writers.
You know, these guys don't come cheap.
And, you know, my original budget was about $6,000 per issue.
You know, and if we got six issues, there's $36,000 right there, right?
Right.
And then, of course, we do have printing costs.
Now, Mark, being in the industry, you know, Mark commits to my layout and design guy, he's got some great contacts.
And we've really got our printing costs in check.
I mean, we've got them way low.
Even if we could even get up to, and this is sort of maybe a lofty goal right now,
A total of 10,000 print issues.
It drops down to about 90 cents an issue or a print.
Right now, it's going to be a minimum of 52 pages, a high-gloss page, and we're going to do a thick stock cover.
Do you guys remember Next Generation magazine?
I do.
Yeah.
I mean, one of the last greatest magazines, at least as far as I'm concerned, you know, and they always had that thick cover.
And I've still got, you know, I think the first two years, even their premier issue up in my closet because I just can't throw them away.
They're just too nice.
And they're a resource.
and so on.
Um, you know, and, uh, just, just something that's going to kind of be a resource.
And, uh, Mark, you know, being the great guy is, you know, we're, we're, we put an update in there about, you know, using environmentally conscious, you know, materials and everything, soy inks and, and recyclable paper.
But the thing is going to look beautiful.
Um,
Those are all things that we're thinking about.
Thanks to Mark for coming on and being in the industry and knowing where to go and putting this whole thing together.
The magazine is going to look as good as anything you've ever seen.
I can guarantee you that with him on board this thing.
Yeah.
Yeah, well, for sure.
I mean, every magazine is going to cover everything.
It's going to be heavily weighted with retro, of course.
Certainly any current generation games or gaming, you know, topics that have some sort of a historical background or relevance we want to talk about.
You know, we're kind of going back and forth.
That's not to say we won't, you know, review AAA titles.
But, I mean, what's the point of reviewing, you know, Call of Duty 12 if every other magazine and every other website is already doing it?
You know what I mean?
Right.
And so, you know, like I said...
You may or may not see those types of things reviewed.
Typically, we're going to hopefully look for stuff that kind of flies under the radar.
Certainly, the indie stuff is big right now, and there's tons of innovation there, even on the retro side and mobile.
So you can expect console, mobile, indie, PC gaming, arcade and pinball.
We got Kevin Steele in there from Game Room Magazine going to bring up that end of it.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
You know, we don't really know.
We know it's going to be a minimum of 52 pages and only four pages of ads.
So we want to keep it, you know, lots of in-depth features and stuff and minimal on the ad space.
But, you know, right now we've got so many people.
The trick for us is going to be, you know, how do we juggle everybody?
Is everybody in every issue?
Are some people staggered, you know, every other issue?
Or do we just simply add more pages?
And honestly, that's what we'd want to do.
and I think we get up, you know, if we can get up over, you know, to the 60s, you know, our goal is 50,000, which really is what we've budgeted as sort of a break-even point to produce six 52-page issues.
So if we can go, you know, if we can get up to 60,000, 70,000, we'd like to add, you know, another four pages, you know, four-page increments, of course, and get up to 60 pages and, you know, maybe get into the 80 to 90-page range, maybe before the year's over.
There will be no shortage of content, I'll tell you that.
These guys are already coming up with some great ideas, things they're going to be writing about.
I'm just as excited as everybody else to be reading what all these people have to say.
You're just putting this all together.
You can't wait to read it yourself, I think.
I can't.
I really can't.
I grew up gaming in the 70s.
Electronic Games, the first magazine dedicated to the hobby back in the early 80s.
I also remember, I was really fond of, my first gaming system, and I'm using my quotey fingers, was really a Commodore 64, so I remember...
I remember the magazines that were like the really nice glossy pages in the beginning and the back was more like newspaper because it was all the type these into your computer to get these games type of thing.
Yeah, I've got a Commodore 64 set up here in the home arcade.
Yeah, I mean, it's, you know, I collect, you know, that's part of the reason I started Game Gavel, the auction site back in 08, which is to give gamers a better place to buy and sell.
It's a lot cheaper than eBay, free listings, free seller stores.
We got tons of great sellers on there.
And the plan, and we're not going to bombard people with game gavel in the magazine, but on the digital side, well, first off, everybody that buys the print subscription is going to get digital for free, okay?
So you're going to be able to kind of get both.
The digital magazines, we will have maybe just a shopping cart icon.
So if you're reading about a game, you know, we'll put a shopping cart on there.
If you click the shopping cart, it'll pull up the listings in the auction site for all the other gamers that are selling that game.
Right.
and bringing people into the marketplace to buy and sell.
So that's kind of the plan, kind of integrating the commerce with the content, at least with the digital.
I was going to say a little bit of synergy between your different projects, but that's smart.
I mean, there's nothing wrong with that.
If you guys want to consider donating to Retro, the throwback video game magazine, you can find that on Kickstarter.
It's at kickstarter.com slash project slash SoCalMike, but it's probably easier to just go to kickstarter.com and search for Retro.
Retro, some of the different various award tiers.
You can actually get for $7 the premiere issue of Retro.
If you want to look at a six-issue one-year digital subscription, you can kick back $12 for that.
DarkSakura, you said the magic P word, pinball?
Yeah.
So, that actually really, my husband and I collect pinball tables.
Oh, right.
And we're down to three.
But we have a Twilight Zone, so that's what matters.
What else do you guys have?
We have World Cup Soccer 94, which was my favorite, and Jackbot.
Oh, right, yeah.
We actually got rid of No Fear for Jackbot.
We actually have hung out a few times with Steve Ritchie.
Yeah, we know Steve.
He's such a great guy.
Oh, yeah.
And he does the voices.
That's so amazing.
What I was wondering about the pinball is if you were going to be doing interviews with Stern and covering some of the newer...
Yeah, I mean, I know Stern real well.
We know Jersey Jack real well.
You know, they just came out with Wizard of Oz and they're working, I think, on their second table now.
So, yeah, I mean, anytime there's a new table out, we want to do, you know, an in-depth review of that thing and, you know, interview the designers behind it.
We've just, we've got great, you know, again, I've just got some great, great contacts going back, you know, through the years and everything.
And we do Retro Gaming Roundup podcast for about six years.
And every one of those shows, we do a one to two hour interview with somebody, you know, famous, some old gaming, you know, god.
We did Al Alcorn and Ted Dabney, all the Activision guys, Steve, I mean, some of the pinball folks.
I mean, it goes on and on and on.
DarkTetsuya in our chatroom says, out of all the names you got involved, who were you the most excited to get on board?
Um, boy, I would have to say, if I could answer to, well, I don't know.
I'd have to say Jeremy Parrish because, you know, Jeremy is, is such a consummate professional.
He's just, he's a great writer.
Um, and people love Jeremy.
You know, there's just something about him that everybody loves.
Um, uh,
I hate to single anybody out.
I mean, Sean Baby, Chris Kohler, Jeff Green, Andy Eddy, for God's sakes, Cat Bailey, Ryan Scott, Leonard Herman, a big historian in the industry that writes just these great books.
What I'm excited about having Lenny on board is he writes some of them.
Are you familiar with Lenny Herman?
The name doesn't ring a bell, but it's probably one of those things when you tell me what he did, I'll be like, yes.
But, you know, if you can write, you know, four or five, six pages on a particular topic, you know, I think kids will read it and really learn something about the industry.
And that's what we really want to do.
We want to sort of preserve the past and kind of look back and understand, you know, why the industry is what it is.
I mean, God, when it started, everybody thought it was going to be a fad, I remember, back in the 70s and the 80s, you know.
Nobody knew it was going to be around for another 30 years.
I really love reading the stories from the time when people were developing for the Atari 2600 when it just sounded like it was so much pressure and it was like one or two people and it's such a different type of culture than what we see now.
We had two days to make Pac-Man.
I'm always fascinated by that and really how it's grown into these.
Now you look at a game like Grand Theft Auto V and it's like shooting five movies all at the same time.
Yeah, it's really insane.
It's really insane.
But yeah, I'd have to say Jeremy.
I was really glad to get him on more, but not to just pick anybody.
I'm just loving everybody that we've assembled into this thing so far.
And a lot of them have asked to get involved with it after the fact.
Nice.
which is great, which just sort of, I think, just led some credibility to the idea of everybody wants to be a part of this thing.
And getting all of this wisdom and history packed into the pages of a single magazine has never been done before.
Even on a website, there's not been a writing team like this assembled.
So it's just a special thing.
And I think we've got a long way to go.
I mean, we're
You know, around 35% of goal right now.
But, you know, we've got 20 days to go.
That sounds like a long time, but the days kind of keep ticking away.
And I keep thinking to myself, you know, the trend has kind of been down.
But I've talked to people who run Kickstarters.
I don't know if you guys know anybody or run any yourself.
But it sounds like there's a little bit of a kind of a smile where it kind of dips and goes down.
And then, you know, people just wait because, you know, I wait a lot of times on Kickstarters.
I'll wait till the last few days or the last week, you know.
And then, you know, there's a big kind of surge of people kind of that last week.
and so we kind of hope it goes that way I think the internet is kind of a funky place too where you kind of have to just catch that wave at the right moment where it hits and it goes viral and then it's spreading everywhere and then that's where your Kickstarter is really going to take off so I hope I'm not going to profess to be a very large organization here at Orange Launch Radio or the Voice of Geeks Network but I hope we can do what we can here by having you on tonight to bring awareness to it and maybe cause a little bit of an uptick with that
Again, if you guys want to look at retro, you can check that out at kickstarter.com.
And I am also happy to spread the word around the pinball circles.
Yeah, please do.
I mean, we want to definitely have some pinball content in every issue.
I think there's plenty of things to talk about.
I like the special edition Tron.
Before I let Mike go, Mike, we always ask our guests this when they come on the show, and it may have nothing to do with the project that you're talking about, but we are a video game show.
We want to know what kind of games are you playing this week?
Oh, my gosh.
Well, I just picked up a Missile Command cocktail table here on the Craigslist here in L.A.
for a whopping $140.
Wow.
Really super cheap.
For a cocktail table, that's great.
Oh, my gosh.
I mean, everybody, I got friends all over the country, and you guys are in L.A., right, or Southern California?
We're in Sacramento, so we're about six hours north of you, yeah.
I drove up there.
I drove to Portland and spent a night on the way up in SAC.
I don't know what it is up north, but down here it's just sort of like a feeding frenzy.
My friends are going nuts because I find such great deals like on Craigslist.
They're like, Missile Command, $140?
That would have been $500 in Virginia.
So yeah, I just picked that up and I've been playing some... What was I playing today?
I think Gradius 5 on the PS2.
Great game.
I've got a little man cave down here, kind of home office, where I've got four arcade games.
I've got a Touchmaster hooked up.
I've got an Apple IIc, and my Commodore's hooked up.
I've got about 90 Commodore cartridges, and I play that all the time.
So you don't just talk the talk with this retro stuff.
You walk the walk as well.
Yeah, no, man.
I'm in deep.
Thank God my wife loves to play games as well.
That's how my husband and I got together.
Last thing here, DarkSakura, you had one more thing?
I actually was just thinking of... Imagine if our two vaults combined.
It would totally explode the world.
DarkSakura and her hubby have a huge gaming vault as well.
I want to go play all this stuff now.
But you were actually asking a little bit about what the market is up here.
For a lot of the retro games, they're actually quite expensive.
And...
DarkSakura.com
Right, yeah.
Well, that's one of the greats.
Yeah.
And we could get more if we wanted it.
Well, I've got to wrap up and let Mike go.
Mike, thanks so much for your time here tonight.
Thank you guys so much.
I really appreciate the opportunity to tell your listeners about this.
No worries.
And best of luck with the project.
You know, one thing I don't think I really got out there during the interview is that we love that you're taking an indie approach to it.
We've always been fiercely independent here at Orange Lawn Trader.
You know, we've been doing what we do here since 2002.
Yeah, amazing.
For, you know, 11 plus years.
Before a podcast even was a podcast.
Yes, actually, yeah, we were a live 365 show for a couple years before that.
We tell all the kids to get off our lawn.
But yeah, I mean, we love that you guys are keeping it independent with this.
Even if you are bringing in people who are kind of paid behind the big budget stuff, you're kind of at least getting them outside of that element for this indie production.
I think that's fantastic.
It's great.
I don't know what they're going to be writing about.
We'll obviously kind of nail some of that down as we move forward to building the first issue.
But I really think that they're going to talk about things and write maybe just a little bit differently in this environment than they would normally write working for Future US or IGN or one of these big companies.
So I'm just really excited to kind of give them the freedom to kind of write what they want to write about, how they want to write.
A new side of some of your favorite video game authors.
Hey, one last thing, too.
Speaking of Live365, I also do RetroArcadeRadio.com.
It's just 24 hours a day, live streaming retro gaming-related music and old vintage commercials.
I know you guys are interested in that.
It's been going on.
I've been running that for about five or six years as well.
So RetroArcadeRadio.com, but it's a Live365 station as well.
They served a great purpose for us for many years until we decided to branch out.
But yeah, that's awesome.
That sounds like a great thing to do when you're playing your Commodore 64 with 90 cartridges and all this other crazy stuff you have.
So that's awesome.
Well, best of luck with your various projects.
That's retroarcadegameradio.com?
Retro Arcade Radio.
RetroArcadeRadio.com.
Okay.
So you got RetroArcadeRadio.com, GameGavel.com, and soon Retro Game Magazine or whatever domain you get for this.com as well.
You're a busy guy, Mike.
Best of luck with all your projects.
Thank you so much.
Thank you for taking the time out to be with us here at OLR tonight.
Have a great night.
Bye, guys.
Bye-bye.
Wow, that was awesome.
He should be our new best friend.
You want to be his best friend.
No, I liked him.
He seemed well enough.
But you guys definitely have the retro pinball, that same-sames there.
Well, at the moment he said pinball.
I was like, bing!
Well, you don't get any of that in any of the current publications, really, unless it's specifically pinball.
and I mean especially now with you know for example that Wizard of Oz table has such a heavy video element with it that or all the pinball 2000 that had the screens you're dealing with a pinball and video game you know a digital game combined that isn't baby pac-man
But I still love Baby Pac-Man.
I still love Baby Pac-Man.
I love me some Baby Pac-Man.
Alright, best of luck to those guys.
One more time, you can search for that on Kickstarter.com.
It is retro and I'll probably contribute a little bit for that effort.
I think it's a fine idea they've got over there and I would not mind having some more magazines to put on the shelves here.
Maybe this will take my Kickstarter virginity.
Ooh, okay.
That's right, you've never donated to a Kickstarter.
Well, because my Amazon payments weren't working every time I freaking tried.
All right.
By the way, before we move on to the rest of our gaming weeks, I did want to point out over in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com, there was a lot of other chatter that weren't just questions for Mike, but there was talk going on there about some other gaming magazine memories, and we're going to get into that with our Fugo question of the week later, but I did want to point out for DarkSakra, Codeman was offering to go get high with you on some CMYK fumes.
Oh yeah, I think I actually started that.
There you go.
I'm sorry, if you are a print design person, there is no smell as wonderful as stepping into a print shop and smelling the toxic fumes.
I have to tell you that traditional ink smells a lot different than the soy ink, and I don't know what I like better.
Just saying.
Have you smelled a print shop on weed?
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
to my PS3 character so I managed to get up to level 10 on my 360 character and then I decided well one night I was trying to play with Bobby but he kept getting stuck in like full games and I couldn't join his game so I ended up just going back to single player and trying to finish my 100% stuff so that's what I've been doing since earlier this week and I'm now 80
2% complete, I think.
I'm pretty much almost done with the Epsilon program missions.
What else did I do?
Oh, I finished all the triathlons.
Seriously, Rockstars?
Seriously?
There's a 30-minute fucking long triathlon?
30 minutes in real time of Mashing A. Mashing A for 30 fucking minutes.
That sounds about as awesome as Desert Bus.
I mean, that is so fucking... Oh, it's almost as fun as the part in Epsilon Missions where you have to run for five miles.
So I was sitting there running in circles for about 20 minutes.
That was fun.
Also mashing A for like a while.
And then what else?
So all the races and... I think I'm pretty much... I'm buying property and...
I don't know, pretty much I just have to do a lot of the collectibles and stunt jumps and the planes under the bridges and stuff.
So I have to finish that, and I think that'll be about it.
Not much left to go, but I'm going to still work on that.
But later this week, though, we are going to be doing two VOG gaming nights for Grand Theft Auto Online.
One day on PlayStation 3, one day on Xbox 360.
So...
stay tuned in the forums, I'm thinking right now that it's going to be Friday, Saturday I just have to make sure it doesn't conflict with any shows that's about it as long as it's not Saturday night when USL is on, you should be good if you do it a little earlier in the night Saturday should be fine
Thanks for watching!
So I'm going to get caught up this week.
I did play a little bit of Final Fantasy XIV, not as much as you'd think based on what I said last week.
I was fortunate enough to get into Hearthstone Beta, which is Blizzard's free-to-play trading card game.
I talked a little bit about this at length on Horde House.
I'll kind of repeat some of that here.
I did enjoy the game well enough especially for something that's free to play I found the gameplay to be a little bit basic but some card game aficionados who know this stuff a little more than I do seem to really enjoy it and kind of find the depth in it that I'm currently I guess not seeing or whatever
I was really surprised that you draw so few cards and it's really like the mana's all just kind of built in.
You don't have cards on your own for that or whatever.
But I guess the easy to play thing is really to try to draw in as many people as possible.
And kind of my final verdict on Hearthstone from what I've played on it so far is that I think it's going to be a great tablet game.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Audio Surf 2 Audio Surf 1
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Remember that?
Where they come down the conveyor belt, the colored pieces will come down the conveyor belt and you try to match three, match five.
You kind of tried to do that really quick in AudioSurf.
But AudioSurf had a mode that I thought was way better called the mono mode where it was just pick up, you know, the pieces are black or white and it's just about navigating and being able to move through the field as fast as possible so you pick up only the pieces that are colorful and not the pieces that are, you know, the wrong color.
I like that mode the best.
because what you can do is that like let's say you know you're about to go down a big hill because when the tempo of the song picks up you start to go down a hill well what you do is you swing your character all the way to a side the side of the tunnel and click the mouse button and they'll like fly up in the air and then you're flying down the hill and you do tricks in the air
and then you kind of land like it's like like you're in like a jet ski type thing and you do these tricks I thought that was a really cool little innovation that's like I the way that plays and feels because you know that's when the crescendos of the music happens so to kind of do like this all like right when the crescendo of a big dance song hits like boom I'm gonna go flying in the air and do all these tricks like it's it's really rewarding in that sort of way so um
Yeah, I'm liking what I'm seeing of AudioSurf 2 so far.
I guess one of the other big things they're going to do with it is mods.
They want to have more and more mods and user-created stuff.
I imagine this is going to be a part of that Steam... What do they call it?
The Steam community marketplace or something like that where people can make their own stuff like they have with Skyrim and Civilization and stuff.
I can't imagine this game isn't going to incorporate that big time, so...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I was on another show, the Let's Wow podcast last week, episode 31.
That is now on the feed.
But when I was talking about that, I forgot to plug Gemet's stream that he's doing this Tuesday on into Wednesday.
He's going to be doing a 24-hour live stream for charity.
He's raising money for Breast Cancer Awareness Month.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Thanks for watching!
Twitter.com slash OLR.
We're also on Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
And I think that's it.
That's all I've got to plug right now.
So I guess we should get into some news.
Loki.
All right.
So let's talk a little bit about new devices coming out.
and you may remember we talked briefly about the Mojo which I think is pretty cool the Mad Catz micro console that's going to have Android games and stuff on it what's kind of unique about it is that it can actually play normal Android games it's not a separate marketplace you can actually map the controls and stuff
The only problem with it, though, is it's $250.
But, yeah, so they announced $250.
It's up for pre-order.
Ships in December, tentatively.
Some of the specs on it.
It's going to have 16 gigabytes of storage with microSD support.
Also, they have a 1.8GHz Tegra 4 processor, so it's definitely more powerful than, say, an Ouya.
And it comes with a special controller that's Bluetooth-enabled, which allows you to also use it on Android or as a PC controller, or even use mouse input and stuff.
Um, so that looks pretty cool.
And then one of the other cool things that you can do with this, and I guess it kind of helps warrant the $250 price point, is that you can actually stream PC games with it.
So that's going to be coming, I think, after it launches.
Um, and it's going to like... Wait a minute, Loki, isn't that supposed to be the Steam Machines thing?
Well, technically, yeah, I guess it could be.
But, um...
I think it's kind of cool.
Let's see, here's some more specs on the Mojo.
Two gigs of RAM and one USB 2.0 and one USB 3.0 port.
I mean, that's pretty cool that it supports that.
Bluetooth 4.0 and it's running Android 4.22.
I don't even have a headphone socket on there, so that's kind of cool.
You can listen to your audio through that.
I don't know.
I think for $250 and it can stream games to your TV, that's kind of cool.
If it was just strictly an Android box, that probably wouldn't be worth it for $250.
So, I don't know.
What do you think would make it worth the cost?
For $250, it's going to do a lot more than just play Android games, I think.
The controller looks nice, at least.
I guess a lot of people have their phones and stuff, and it would cost a lot less to probably just get an HDMI out on your phone or get some other type of streaming thing.
Since it does support Android, I suppose you could also use this as a box to watch Netflix or Hulu or anything like that on.
Oh yay, just my living room needs another Netflix device Because I don't have any of those Some people don't have a lot of stuff Or some people might want a second one Or a third or fourth or whatever And plus it looks kind of nice I mean it's shiny, it's got blue light on the front I don't normally purchase my consoles based on lights But it definitely looks better More lights Passed out 57 LEDs
I don't know.
I think the price point is a little expensive.
Maybe if it comes down in price later on, it might be worth it for me.
But I just don't need any more consoles right now.
But the controller looks nice.
I mean, if I could use it on 360 or PS3, I might be down with that.
All right, well, going to some stories about the Xbox One happening out there.
There was a lot of talk this week about, you know, there's been a lot of talk about the Kinect and privacy and all that.
You know, ever since they announced the whole always-on thing, there was the concerns about privacy.
Well, I don't think it's even necessarily that.
It's more ever since they announced all that stuff leaking out and, oh, Microsoft's in bed with the NSA type thing.
Well, yeah, yeah.
But, I mean, this isn't even really about that, but it's been on people's minds because of that ever since they announced the system, and this was kind of an interesting development on that this week.
I'm going to totally pronounce this name, so I apologize, but it's Yusuf Mehdi, who is the Corporate Vice President of Marketing and Strategy for Microsoft, was talking to the National Advertisers Masters of Marketing Conference.
This was happening in Phoenix last
Thanks for watching.
See you next time.
You know, it's making games out of advertising, like, you know, interactive flash type things.
The fact that, like, take a social app like Foursquare is gamifying social media by, you know, you check in, you get points, there's the mayorship, there's all that.
That's all gamification because games are fun.
Look at vognetwork.com.
Gamified a radio network of independent podcasts and kind of made a game out of that.
That's gamification.
or the catchpa ones where you have to park the car to get your catchpa.
Yes, which we actually use on vognetwork.com which is a fun one.
Or in reverse, the people who use their advertising as a catchpa.
Oh yeah, where you have to type in the name of the product or what product is blah blah blah.
Nike, just do it.
You have to type in the slogan or whatever.
But anyway, talking about also consolidating more attention that's diffused otherwise on multiple devices Xbox One will make it easier to port real-time fantasy football data into the TV screen as people watch their NFL games It does sound kind of interesting, I know some people that are really into fantasy football and I can sort of see that Wait, was a Kinect going to help do that?
Well, the Xbox One does that because it's that whole like... I was going to say, how is the Kinect supposed to do that?
But you can watch the TV in like the three quarters window and then around the edge kind of has your gamify or whatever.
Yeah, but I'm just trying to figure out how the Kinect is actually going to enhance something that basically I could feed into it normally.
I'm just saying, like, unless is it going to recognize that, you know, say I'm following, you know, my team of players because it knows my face and so that's going to display those stats and I don't know.
Well, anyway, some of this chat led people to believe that, oh, they're going to harvest ad data through the connect.
But Microsoft came out after all of this and said, hold on.
No, no, this is not what we're doing.
And yeah, it just said nobody is working on that.
That's not something that happened.
It is not going to happen without the user having control over it.
But
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
but there's some people out there that have that distrust and question that corporate stuff.
It probably comes from the fact that there's all these dirty rumors out there of all these horrible things that Microsoft could possibly be doing and then they came out and said, yep, we're going to do all that and then Sony said, nope, we're not going to do all that and then Microsoft said, no, we're actually not going to do that now and we're not going to do that now and we're not going to do that now because you people don't like it.
But we may implement those features in the future.
You know, it's the whole flip-flopping that makes people kind of unwary about that stuff.
I think... I mean, what... I don't know.
I guess concerning would have been the features that, okay, we can recognize individual people.
We can cater ads based on those people that happen to be sitting in front of the screen.
We can recognize whether they're looking at the ad because we can see where their eyes are looking or something like that.
You know, or...
How long they're engaged in watching that kind of stuff.
Some of this has to do with patents too.
It causes a lot of buzz going on through because I remember when, wasn't it Microsoft that has that patent for it can detect who is actually watching the film and lock...
Thanks for watching!
But I seem to recall that was an issue like a year ago on the show.
But didn't they try doing gamification of stuff with Kinect and like these stupid interactive ads and stuff through Kinect on the Microsoft?
Well, it's funny you say that because TigerClawedChat at live.vognetwork.com says, you think they'll have achievements just for watching an ad?
And DarkSakura, you're responding to him in chat talking about Gaia Online, which kind of does something like that.
Yeah, you like get Gaia Gold for doing surveys and watching their stupid little ads.
I used to do Gaia back in the day.
Well, I think, okay, well, maybe Microsoft doesn't necessarily have that yet, but you got achievements from playing those Burger King games.
There was achievements in Yaris, which was an Adver game.
Burger King games were just genius.
Actually, yeah, the Burger King games were really like the greatest.
And I'm very disappointed that there's no new Burger King games because they were creepy in their own way and it was just, it was fun.
But besides all of that, I also think though that Microsoft has said there's going to be an achievement for like day one Xbox purchasing, like a day one adopter achievement.
So, I mean, that might not be advertising per se, but they are definitely willing to put achievements in things that are not games.
Right.
Well, they are.
I think they were talking about TV watching and stuff like that as part of an achievement.
Plus, remember now, Xbox rewards and stuff.
They give you rewards for doing different things.
Who's to say they couldn't give you rewards for watching ads?
Codeman in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, it's not that we need less marketing, it's that we need more less annoying marketing.
Well, let me ask this tough question.
What is that?
Then what is marketing that is not annoying?
I think that's a tough question to answer.
Because I think whenever a lot of people feel like they're being kind of like pandered to or marketed to, they might feel a little bit annoyed.
So what's not annoying?
I actually don't mind product placement in a game or in a movie as long as it's not obtrusive like you know the billboards and crazy taxis what I think of or take me to KFC you know like I didn't I wasn't annoyed with that I actually found it funny it was kind of funny
or you know it's stuff that you see in real life you know you're driving through the town you may see an ad for you know like a racing game they have all the Valvoline and Forelli and all that you know that's what you see at an actual racing track that's realistic advertising in the game
or, you know, for example, character walks into, you know, a snack room and goes to a Pepsi machine and gets a Diet Pepsi.
That's unobtrusive marketing.
That's something that would happen in real life.
It all depends.
I mean, I've seen people complain about that kind of stuff in, you know, games where they'll have, you know, Mountain Dew or something and it's like, it's the year 2205 or something ridiculous, you know, in the future and there's all these Mountain Dew machines everywhere.
I think like if you want to do I think people need to feel because right now they feel okay we're being charged for online and now we're also being advertised to at the same time because look at the PlayStation Network they don't really have ads all over the place on the PlayStation you know cross media bar there's not ads just I mean there's a little advertisement ticker thing in the corner we're talking about sales and stuff of games
DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
You have Microsoft that's charging for online, Sony that's not charging for online, there's no ads there, and Microsoft, on top of charging you, they're also throwing ads in your face.
Whether it be in a corner of the screen, and you don't necessarily have to see it, but it's still there, and people are like, what the fuck?
Aren't you getting enough money from me already, and now you're making ad dollars on top of that?
And so that's kind of where the problem is.
Zinacor in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, Beer commercials are awesome marketing.
Most interesting man in the world is awesome marketing.
You know, that kind of had me thinking is that, well, you know, it is very interesting when we talk about marketing vices, especially things like beer.
You know, who has traditionally had, you know, Budweiser has had some of the, like, biggest commercials you can possibly think of out there in history.
And then I kind of think of, you know what's really fascinating, and this is kind of an unpopular opinion.
I'm not saying it's good.
I'm just saying it's fascinating, is that look at the history of cigarette advertising.
Blenstones!
Not like professionally, but I can think of what I saw when I was a kid back when there were vending machines in restaurants and what I see now, which is hardly anything.
Before that, they used to do Marlboro ads featuring the Flintstones.
It was like, Marlboro's tastes good, like a cigarette should.
And then they would have doctor endorsements in magazines prior to the 60s.
They would have actual written doctor endorsements for cigarettes being good for you.
Mm-hmm.
and of course now truth in advertising is a really, really big thing.
So of course we don't have that anymore nor do we have the television ads.
Although I have seen those little vending machines repurposed.
I have two.
Yeah, it's kind of funny how they'll put those old cigarette machines to use.
I think at the Crocker Museum, they actually do replicas of some of the art pieces in small scale.
Or the flip, because they don't really make cigarette vending machines anymore, at least not in California.
If you go to a bar where they do sell cigarettes in the outdoor area, which is the only place you can smoke, it's like the type of vending machine that sells chips and cookies in other places.
It's fascinating to me.
I miss the old cigarette machine aesthetic, even if I don't agree with the product.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
No, the old cigarette machine, I should say that.
They were just so neat.
They were kind of cool.
You pull the knob and out come your smokes.
But that's also marketing in a way.
It is.
And it's cigarettes that you're not supposed to be having.
But keep in mind this.
Remember what I mentioned about the Crocker?
Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Anyway, anyhow, we're getting a little off track here.
A little.
But yeah, advertising, who knows what's going to develop in the future as entertainment gets more and more and more interactive.
They'll come up with something.
Anyhow, DarkSakura, before we get to release dates.
Oh man, Reginator, I am not going to quote Dennis Leary.
Except for, what is it?
You have the...
How about life's gonna suck when you grow up?
What is it?
You have the orgasm, you smoke the butt, you eat a cookie, you go to bed, and that's the end of the story.
About what?
The meaning of happiness.
Anyway.
So, um, oh yeah, and the, uh, I only want to eat meat from cows that smoke.
Moo!
Okay.
Video games.
Silent Hill.
How about Silent Hill?
Ah!
I'm gonna have to smoke just to get through that game, my god.
Just kidding.
Don't you know that's what the fog is?
So anyway, WayForward did Silent Hill Book of Memories, and it turns out that before they did Contra 4, they had a prototype out for another Silent Hill game for the Nintendo DS.
And their little prototype starred the dude from Silent Hill 2.
and there was some video out about it about what it was supposed to look like but of course that got cancelled and they also had and this makes me think back to the whole Biohazard 1.5 where
They had a completely different version of Silent Hill Book of Memories and ended up, I suppose, scrapping it and doing it what we have now.
But the quote on there was saying is that they had two different perspectives for in the game.
This one would switch between an isometric and an over the shoulder.
And they were looking more at the combat and puzzle side.
Elements to zoom out, but they said that the technology just wasn't there to do it, so they switched how they did it.
But there is a video out there of what the, I'd say, original concept of Chain of Memories was, for anyone who's interested in it.
Which for me, I love...
I love looking at prototypes and the differences.
I would still love to find a playable Biohazard 1.5 just so that I could see for myself what the differences were.
But I love when they come out and say, well, this is what you almost got, unless what we almost got would have been better.
You know what I mean?
But I wouldn't have minded having a good solid Silent Hill game on my DS.
Yeah, Book of Memories got a lot of kind of hate, though.
It wasn't... See, the thing with Book of Memories, like, I didn't hate the game, but it wasn't Silent Hill to me.
It was very much not Silent Hill to me, which it was definitely, like, more of, like, a spin-off type of game.
I haven't wanted to play a Silent Hill game since Homecoming.
I honestly think that Homecoming is the last... I'm not even going to say great Silent Hill game.
It's one of the last good, faithful Silent Hill games to me.
So...
All right, well, let's travel around the world and check out release dates of games that will, you know, actually be coming out.
You know, it's pretty good that Silent Hill game didn't come out, because if you remember correctly, all the portable Silent Hill games haven't been very good.
Like, you remember the PSP ones and stuff?
It's just... I never really played the PSP one.
I remember it, though.
That was Origins, right?
I think, yeah.
I'm confusing.
There's that PSP one and the... They ported it to PS2.
Oh, yeah.
Okay.
Anyways, this week, not a whole ton of stuff coming out.
It's more of like a catch-up week, I guess.
So, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Wii.
I hope you like hunting because Cabela's African Adventures will be coming out this week.
Also on... What was it?
PlayStation 3 as well.
Let's see here.
We had...
Wipeout, Create, and Crash on Wii U, 3DS, Wii, Xbox 360, and of course the Xbox 360 one is a Kinect game.
Also, what else was there this week?
Seriously, not a lot of anything.
That can't be it.
You alright?
There's just not a lot of... There's a lot of garbage coming out.
Oh, here we go.
You're just weeding through the garbage right now?
I'm weeding through the garbage, yeah, because...
And last two things this week, Cradle of Egypt 2 for 3DS and Girls Fashion Shoot on 3DS.
That's literally it.
Alrighty.
Alright, going to Japan and checking out what is coming out in Japan this week.
Can we hang out with Irene?
Can we?
Can we?
Can we?
Yeah, I should have called her and been like, hey, I hate to interrupt your honeymoon and God knows what's going on right now.
But...
Are there lines for another Monster Hunter?
I know, I gotta ask you, what's on the shelves over there?
We do have to get her and Silent Nathan back on the show though, miss them.
Alright, coming out on October 17th on the PlayStation 3 over in Japan.
Beyond Two Souls is getting its release in Japan.
It's the first print limited edition as well as regular.
FIFA 14, World Class Soccer and some various editions.
Saint Seiya, Brave Soldiers in regular and limited editions.
No way.
Way.
They're doing a Saint Seiya game?
Brave Soldiers.
Good lord, that's an old series.
So that's coming out on the PlayStation 3.
Coming out on the Xbox 360 this week in Japan.
FIFA 14, because you know that game is huge.
And there's like Xbox Live card kind of pack-ins to go with that.
On the Vita this week, FIFA 14 is there as well.
I'm thinking the FIFA 14 is kind of a big release this week.
But on the Wii U, it's all about Rayman Legends, which sees its release in Japan this week on October the 17th.
Lastly, checking the 3DS here.
Actually, not a lot of stuff this week, probably just because they're coming off the Pokemon High.
There's still a lot of cases and...
Accessories and things.
But there is one game coming out from Namco Bandai this week.
And I'm going to butcher this name.
It is Sentotuchu Densetsu no Shinobi 2 Survival Battle.
And all I have is a screenshot and the little subtitle on it is Battle for Money.
So it looks like kind of like a ninja fighting type of game.
It also says Fuji Television.
So I wonder if this isn't based on some type of game show in Japan.
Or maybe it's like a ninja...
DarkSakura
Well, let's see.
There's not a whole big pile of stuff coming out.
We have on the 17th, we have Device 6 for iOS.
We have Pocket Titans also for iOS.
And on the 18th, we have Alien Rage.
We have Skylander Swap Force and Skylander... Actually, two different versions of Skylander Swap Force.
Looks like the handheld...
the 3DS, Xbox 360 Wii U, Wii, Playstation 3 and then they're separating their release for the Playstation 4 and the Xbox One so that's it like I said it was a little so small you know everybody's just too busy playing Pokemon except for all of us here at OLR
I'll get in on that craze soon.
I am not going to make poor Isabelle make meth in the basement of my town hall to keep my flowers pretty.
I just got Lobo and I just got Peck and I got Margie.
I'm playing in my village.
Fine, so you refuse to give up one addiction for another.
Bitch, please.
But as I told you, you can't visit my town this week to get petition signatures because my town went to Japan.
My entire town got up and flew to Japan this week.
That's okay.
Actdeft will help me.
Lord knows how Princess Irene is corrupting my villagers at this very moment.
It won't be the same town.
You want to know what's funny?
Huh?
Is that remember how Butch moved from my town to yours?
Mm-hmm.
Butch has been hanging out in my shopping center.
Oh, really?
So Butch didn't want to go to Japan.
Alright.
It's like they're real people.
Okay, a few more news stories for you guys in the Classic Game of the Week.
But first, a very new game, right, Loki?
And that's the best part about it, is they're not even people.
They're animals.
Yes, speaking of addictions, Grand Theft Auto V has officially broken a bunch of records, including the PlayStation Network record for the most downloaded title in history of the PlayStation Network.
And there's also some Guinness Book Records, which...
I don't know.
So anyways, let's see.
Best selling action adventure video game in 24 hours.
Best selling video game in 24 hours.
And they really narrow it down.
Fastest entertainment property to gross $1 billion.
Fastest video game to gross $1 billion.
Highest grossing video game in 24 hours.
Highest revenue generated by an entertainment product in 24 hours.
And the most viewed trailer for an action adventure video game.
I don't know if they really need trailer in there.
I mean, that's just like... Great advertisement.
Can they go too far with like, you know...
Breaking down these records, I mean, I don't know.
This is all press release fodder.
I mean, it is, although I shouldn't belittle some of these accomplishments, because obviously, Grand Theft Auto, whether you like it or not, or like it too much or not, it is a huge thing in the gaming industry.
Huge.
And, you know, these records do back that up.
Practically...
Actdeft.com
I actually remember way back the David Chappelle show where he did the Grand Theft Auto parody with the gun switching.
Like, if your life was Grand Theft Auto.
Yeah, that was funny.
That was pretty funny.
I remember that.
Good stuff.
Also, Grand Theft Auto Online, there's been some hiccups, but they almost have it all taken care of.
And to kind of...
Compensate players and maybe get people more interested in checking out online.
If you played any portion of the online in the month of October, you get a half a million dollars in in-game money.
That's in-game money, not an actual half a million dollars.
I wish.
That'd be awesome.
Some of the headlines I saw out there was GTA to give their players a half million dollars and then you click on the link and then the sub headline is in-game cash.
Of course.
You cheap bastard.
Click me, click me.
Of course, you have to play during the month of October.
You will have to also install the upcoming title update 1.04, which is going to fix some other problems and causing vehicle purchase losses and stuff like that.
And then there's going to be two deposits of $250,000.
I'm not sure when those are going to be coming.
I don't know if it's right after each other or if it's just...
Don't know how to do it, but that's cool.
More money.
Money's good.
Then, of course, you know, this is interesting.
This sort of happened with Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, except it wasn't necessarily that an artist was trying to sue the game because their music was being used without their permission, but it was because they thought the game was based off of their lifestyle, but
Anyways, there's an artist saying that he wants his music taken out of the game.
And that's Daz Dillinger.
And he has a couple tracks in there with, I guess, Corrupt under the group banner, The Dog Pound.
And so there's two tracks.
And he's saying that he was offered $4,271 for his songs.
But then, I guess...
And now he's pissed off that he feels because they made a billion dollars that he wants more money or something.
Right.
Unless there's something specifically in his contract about royalties.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Are they necessary to the plot?
No.
Like the Kanye song in Saints Row 3.
You can't do that scene without the song.
It's really awesome.
Exactly.
You have to have certain songs.
But are those songs necessary?
No, it's just on the radio.
The other thing, too, is that he broke with those groups.
Yeah.
So the guy's actually not... Unless it has to be some sort of bitterness association...
Oh, I fell out with them.
They owe me money.
But I mean, there's probably tons of independent rap artists to get featured in a Grand Theft Auto game that would like, they would pay rock star money to have that opportunity.
There's some good artists in there.
In fact, I started listening to some of the other stations because I was just listening to the classic rock station and actually I've been listening to the pop station now even though Britney's on there.
You have a Britney Spears song in Grand Theft Auto.
They have Gimme More.
Yeah.
That is one of my favorites, not gonna lie.
Dan was listening to the 70s station, that was hilarious.
I was hoping they'd have Work Bitch, because I just, you know, love that song.
Yeah, I saw that advertisement on YouTube the other day.
I'm like, what have you become, Brittany?
I mean, seriously, this whole reinvention of yourself.
Call the governor.
There's actually some good songs, like on Radio Mirror Park, they have, it's all these independent guys, I guess, and they have a...
A synth-pop track that I put in my car.
It was actually the one that was in the last trailer that they did for the game.
It was Sleepwalking by the Chain Gang of 1974.
Great, great artists that I discovered through the game.
And so...
See, that's what I like about this game.
and well and this show was founded on DDR and I know I found so many artists through DDR especially the the ultimate and if anything if you happen to not be familiar with the slight musical interlude that Eddie Murphy took part in you get the wonderful track of party all the time on there which is it's always fantastic pretty bad it's fantastic so that's worth it right there
And some very exciting news.
The guy that does the voice of Franklin, Sean Fontenot,
Sean Fontino, he is working on a project with the voice actor from San Andreas who did the voice of CJ Young Marley and basically this came up I guess at the New York Comic Con panel and they were asking him questions on it but he dodged the questions and changed the subject so
The thoughts may be, you know, the thought, at least I had from that is, ooh, CJ's coming back to San Andreas.
That's pretty exciting, even though they said that the whole universe that takes place before 4 doesn't really exist.
I just don't think it's really exciting.
You know, CJ may make a return, even though he would be like,
I hope that's some DLC coming because that would be pretty cool
By the way, Dan showed me something in Grand Theft Auto that actually completely had me in stitches.
And that's the war vet that hangs out in front of that house by the fence who talks all the conspiracy theory stuff.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
I sat and listened to that for like 30 minutes.
It was freaking funny.
And sad, and sad.
So going to our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com, there's some other chat about great celebrity crossover songs.
Dungeon Buster says Don Johnson's Heartbeat is also in there.
They totally ripped from the one-hit wonders countdown that they did on VH1 a while back.
And then Bobby Blackwolf brought up this truly, truly classic song.
The Ballad of Bilbo Baggins by Leonard Nimoy Did you watch that commercial with him and Zachary Quinto?
That sounds familiar.
They're each in their own car trying to get to play golf.
And while he's driving, he's singing the song in his car.
Let's not forget Shatner had at least two albums of him singing all of the hits.
Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.
Dragon Quest Series Dragon Quest Series
All eight games, or the first eight, because technically I think there's ten of them now with the online one.
The first eight games are going to be coming out for iOS and Android.
Dragon Quest 1 will be out this year, getting it all started.
There's a teaser site out there saying that it will be coming out for iOS and Android, in Japan at least, in the winter.
We don't know how much that will cost, but if it's Square Enix, you can count on a premium.
Don't know which versions of the game either.
So yeah, there you go.
A new Dragon Quest Monsters game called Super Light is also on the way to iOS and Android.
You know, a lot of people remember Dragon Quest here in America.
Of course, we got it as Dragon Warrior, but a lot of people remember...
Oh, speaking of magazines, which was kind of the theme of the show earlier, I remember the Nintendo Power, you got the Dragon Warrior Guide with it, right?
Or was that when you bought the game?
You got it with either the game or you got it with a magazine, probably both.
I think it's a magazine.
Yeah, you got that Dragon Warrior Guide, and so I know a lot of people really knew that game, so I think there'll be some people to kind of jump on it when it's re-released for iOS later this year, we'll see.
But, you know, all eight.
That's pretty crazy.
I mean, Dragon Quest VIII was a PlayStation 2 game.
It was really good, too.
It was one of my favorites in the whole series.
Speaking of big Square Enix properties, going to mobile.
I don't know if you guys heard this.
Final Fantasy VI, confirmed.
It will be coming to iOS and Android this year.
Yay!
and I seem to remember when Final Fantasy 5 came out earlier this year I remember thinking like well this is this is testing the waters for this Final Fantasy 6 will be the next big one and sure enough here it is so they've said in regards to Final Fantasy 6 the battle systems have been altered for the other mobile remakes and Final Fantasy and Final Fantasy 6 will be the same
Uh, so, yeah, I guess on the mobile devices, the battle systems have been adjusted.
You won't have to do as much grinding and fighting as much.
You can just enjoy the game straight up.
You won't be able to, you won't have to do one, two step, oh, random battle, one, two.
Some people, that's going to rub some people the wrong way.
I'm very curious to see how Sabin's moves transfer over.
Like, does that mean you're going to have to just kind of use your finger to draw the different patterns?
Because he was the one, like, you actually do quarter circle forward to have him do, like, a big fireball and stuff.
Remember that?
Yeah, I don't know.
I'm very curious to see how some of that translates over.
And also, you know, there was a big conversation on this going on on Twitter this week.
You know, I talk a lot with like, you know, Spike from Gameboy.org.
And he's kind of not happy to hear this news because Final Fantasy V, let's just say, cut a few corners when it came to art assets especially.
And in my opinion, the game looks very outsourced in some places.
The art assets aren't as good as they could be and so on.
So there's a little bit of concern out there that this translation is probably not going to be very good.
And it's definitely going to be just kind of a cash-in.
I know this is one of my very favorites in the entire series.
DarkSakura, what do you think about this Final Fantasy VI coming to iPhone and Android?
I know you like this game a lot.
Yeah, I love the game, but to be honest, I have the cartridge and I have the PlayStation version.
So it's sort of like, I don't need it.
Mm-hmm.
Sometimes it's still fun to see your old games get remade, though.
I mean, when they're good remakes, right?
Yeah.
Like a lot of people, I haven't played it yet, but I'm hearing Wind Waker, I'm hearing amazing things about that, you know.
I'm actually getting more to the point where the only thing that I play on my iPhone is freaking Bejeweled or puzzle games.
And if I'm wanting to play a, like, and this is Cody Fingers' legit game, I'm gonna play on my 3DS or I'm gonna play on my PC.
So...
Well, speaking of 3DS, Alan Alchemy in our chatroom says, I want a proper Final Fantasy 5 and Final Fantasy 6 DS or 3DS remake.
God damn it.
None of this iOS HD sprite crap.
You know, I think that's where a lot of people are at is because, you know, the 3D remake of Final Fantasy 4 and 3 was pretty good.
So we were hoping to get the same treatment for Final Fantasy 5.
I also...
Sorry.
Go ahead, Loki.
Sorry.
Fine, DarkSakura, go.
Okay, fine.
I use the power of my boobs to go first.
I agree with Actdeft, Einhander, but I want a full HD version of Einhander, and I want them to do a freaking sequel.
Well, keep on wishing.
I know, I know, but I love that game.
I would settle for a Final Fantasy IV version where they did the after years or whatever, or Final Fantasy VI.
That is also coming as Final Fantasy IV The After Years is also coming to iOS and Android.
That was in one of those news stories somewhere.
I'd like Final Fantasy VI The After Years or...
That would be really cool to see, like, a sequel to one of the older Final Fantasy games in that way.
After Years wasn't terrible, but, you know, I think the PSP was probably the best version of that, which so many people never even saw it.
Yeah.
All right.
Let's move on.
Are we to the Classic Game of the Week?
I think we are.
It's that time.
Ah, shit.
We've just been talking about some classics, like...
Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy 6 and so forth so DarkSakura's gonna dive into the gaming vault and I think it's a non-RPG she picked this week this one may as well be for Bobby like you were telling me offline earlier yeah I actually asked DarkSakura I was like were you picking this to troll certain chatters of ours and she's like no and I'm like but you do realize dot dot dot she's like oh yeah it's like oh oh alright well enough teasing what is the classic game of the week this week
The classic game of the week is Marathon.
Marathon was a first-person shooter done by Bungie, and it came out in 1994 for the Macintosh.
People who say that there's not games for the Mac, look, there's a game.
One game.
Congrats.
You've got that and Crystal Quest.
I know, I know.
Anyway, the game was Bungie's second FPS game.
The first was Pathways into Darkness.
And the game basically was sort of, I wouldn't say biting on Doom, but it was seen as the Mac counterpart to Doom.
So, um, and of course this game didn't get a PC version until 1995.
Samarathon was very action-oriented, very similar to Doom in how it played.
It had a multiplayer deathmatch mode.
You could have up to eight players on separate machines on the same LAN.
So it was basically like, we love you Mac players, here you go.
And of course it also had sequels.
It had Marathon 2 and Marathon Infinity.
And then in 1996 Bungie completed Super Marathon which was Marathon and Marathon 2 that was on the Bondi Pippin.
So, I'm not going to go into too much about the game itself because the story on it is really freaking in-depth.
I mean, we're talking a super, super rich plot.
And, you know, story twists and a lot of things that I think that sort of become a future nod to...
DarkSakura.com
The important thing that I think about this one is the fact that, number one, yeah, it was on the Mac.
I mean, you had very few games, I think, because this was right when the transition, it used to be that, you know, a lot of your, you know, you had Lode Runner and all of your old Apple IIe games, and you had, like, the early Mac games, like all your Carmen Sandiego stuff and different ones.
You didn't have like dedicated adult, I'd say adult themed games.
And this one I thought was supposed to be pretty, it was pretty big news at the time.
So it is in a semi-3D rendered world.
It's all, you know, texture mapped and dynamic lit and everything.
It has an option called a free look where you can actually look around the character and you can use your mouse to switch weapons and
It meant you could look down, you could move around, you could look around corners.
And the big thing, it was level oriented.
It's kill enemies, avoid obstacles, the usual type of FPS stuff.
And then to advance to your next level, you had to find a terminal that your AI could teleport you from.
So, it had different objectives that you had to participate in in the game, including your puzzles.
One level didn't have oxygen in it, so you had to complete it before asphyxiating.
And you had motion sensors that you'd have to use.
Different weapons.
Your weapons were, you had your fists, a pistol, assault rifle, rocket launcher, a flamethrower that wouldn't kill everything, a fusion gun, and then you had this weird alien weapon.
So that's another thing that came up in Halo, you know, where you could pick up the aliens' weapons.
Like I said, also you have a multiplayer version where it was a deathmatch, where you had up to eight people on a land game.
and does basically go around beat each other up until one's left.
Macworld gave this game the Game Hall of Fame award for Best Network Game of 1995 and Bungie wanted to add more scenarios to it but did not.
It looks like they were trying to incorporate them into Marathon 2.
Marathon is basically the big Mac enthusiast game.
It started, I think, the realm of serious gaming on Mac.
For everyone who says, yeah, Macs don't have games, this was, I think, the first attempt to really reach out to that market.
It ended up being so popular that they did end up putting it out on PC later on with a trilogy set.
And they even were supporting the Pippin, like I said earlier.
That YouTube ran out, so I'm going to switch to this from the Xbox 360 remake music here real quick.
This is from Durandal.
Well, at any rate, there were concepts of the AI working that were taken from Marathon that were, as I said, later incorporated into the Halo series.
And now there's also a version that came out in 2011 that is a port of Marathon for the iPad that was released for free.
So if you want this and you have an iPad, you can definitely go play it.
There's also, you can get the Aleph One engine.
It's at the Marathon Open Source Project.
And there is a site called The Trilogy Release that has downloadable copies of Marathon and the M1A1.
So you can go play it.
All right.
That's it then?
Your classic game of the week?
It is.
Or as Bobby keeps yelling in chat, Halo Zero.
Which I suppose is one way of looking at it.
I mean, in a way.
Without this, you wouldn't have Halo.
I think a lot of the inspiration for Halo came from this.
So, Bobby, it's not necessarily a troll on my part.
It's a...
Thank you for watching!
Dark Castle Dark Castle
was a great Macintosh game back in the day.
If you've never checked that out, just saying.
I know what you're talking about is you're talking about a different era of Macintosh, sort of, but just kind of saying.
This was right about when PC really, really was picking up.
You know, when the Windows format, because I think this was right around the Windows 95 era.
So we're looking at the big jump from Mac to PC as far as...
I'd say the everyday user.
Alright, Bobby Blackwolf in our chatroom says, I approve of this classic game of the week, Hearts, and he is eating his peas.
Good, good boy.
You can have a fudge pop when you're done.
DungeonBuster in chat says that, reminds us you can play the Marathon Trilogy on PCs for free thanks to Bungie.
It's at source.bungie.org So no excuse for you to not check out this game of the week.
And I'm going to see if it's actually still free on iPad.
Nice.
All right.
There you go.
All right.
We are definitely running long for this first half of the show, so let's take a break, guys.
When we come back, we will have more Orange Launch Radio, Rapid Fire News, Fugle Question of the Week, your emails, phone calls, and plenty more when we come back with more of Orange Launch Radio right after this.
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio episode number 523 already in progress here on October the 13th of 2013.
Wow, Halloween is sneaking up on us fast.
I don't know if you guys have any plans.
Loki, is Josh at about that age where you actually do stuff for Halloween or he's still got another year or two?
He goes trick-or-treating.
Yeah?
Usually just around the block.
That's a lot of candy you can get for yourself to eat, huh?
New Kirk or Old Kirk?
New Kirk.
He's going to be a little heartbreaker.
That is so funny.
That's going to be adorable.
Julian's what, six, seven?
Yeah, last year he was Iron Man.
Yeah, he's six.
Oh my gosh.
All right.
One of my friends is, I don't know how much about this I should say on air, but one of my friends is having a party and the whole theme about it is internet memes.
So I have to figure out which one I'm going to do.
And I'm pretty sure I know, but I don't want to say on air because I know this person listens to the show and I want them to be surprised.
But yeah, I'm so looking forward to seeing the costumes that come out of this.
That'd be fun.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
because I forgot for Mighty No.
9.
I never ended up contributing to that.
And I forgot for something else, too, I was going to contribute to recently.
I think it was the – well, I think it's coming up in Rapid Fire News.
Let me peek real quick.
Oh, yeah, it is coming up.
I'll tell you in a minute here.
But, yeah.
He's raw.
Way to tease everybody.
I wanted to remember, so I did the donation during the break here.
I hope it gets funded so I can get some magazines.
I want him to hire me.
You should write a letter.
You never know.
I saw another podcaster on the list.
And Actdeft, you know what?
I don't think Rob could be Courage Wolf.
Rob would make a good Moon Moon.
What?
I don't know what meme you're referencing there.
You haven't seen Moon Moon?
It's this derpy wolf picture.
No.
No, it's pretty funny.
Oh, God.
Just look up Moon Moon.
All right, I will, I will.
All right.
Dress up like scumbag Steve.
Funny you mentioned that, because I told Alan that's what he should be, and he really took offense to that.
But I'm like, but, like, you're tall and, like, you have to go T, like, you can do it.
See, because I don't know half the names of them out there, but maybe, like, was it that guy that's high or whatever that comes to the, you know, the...
and EpiphanyGuy.
I forget what the... Keanu Reeves?
No, not the Keanu Reeves guy.
There's one that's like a guy at a concert or like a rave or something like that.
And he's just kind of standing there like high looking.
I don't know.
You need to go to knowyourmem.com and find it on there.
There's a whole website about it.
That's the problem though is I don't know what it's called so it'd be kind of hard to look it up.
Whatever.
It's no big deal.
Alright, let's move on.
Rapid Fire News.
Talk about quickly what's going on in the gaming world.
Loki.
So the first piece of DLC for Saints Row 4 comes out on October 22nd in North America, October 23rd in the UK.
And it's the Enter the Dominatrix DLC.
Remember, Enter the Dominatrix was going to be what Saints Row 4 was.
Originally, they were planning on doing this standalone expansion for Saints Row 3.
It's basically an alternate storyline to what Saints Row 4 is.
It includes an alternate Zin invasion storyline with the Saints trapped in a virtual world run by an alien.
AI program known as the Dominatrix.
And they have to survive, I guess, against a bunch of sex workers and gimps and stuff in the game.
So... Only a game like Saints Row can you be describing like this.
And I guess it's gonna have new weapons, enemies, allies, and they said missions, and a behind-the-scenes commentary.
Taking what I learned from Saints Row III and to all those that have Saints Row IV, I caution you, wait until the reviews come out before you decide to buy this DLC, especially if you decide to buy a season pass because a season pass is for two pieces of DLC.
because if it's anything that stays for the third those pieces of DLC were 30 minutes long and they were crap you played them once there's like four missions and you're done with them and you're just like why the fuck did I just spend money on that so take the time to read the reviews on the DLC before you purchase it because that's what I'm gonna do because
I've gotten screwed multiple times by Saints Row the Third, so just a fair warning.
And yes, it will be, I think, $7 for the DLC.
Yeah, $7.
So, cool.
If you want to get an Xbox 360 and haven't done so yet, there are going to be some holiday bundles, and they are launching, I believe, today.
And those holiday bundles are going to net you not only game systems, but two free games with each one.
So, for example, they have a...
for $299, a 250GB system with Halo 4 and Tomb Raider, a 4GB system with Kinect with Kinect Sports Season 2 and Kinect Adventures.
Well, that's technically one free game because Kinect Adventures comes with Kinect.
Just saying.
And then, of course, also a $399 bundle for a 250GB system with Kinect and Forza Horizon as well as Kinect Sports Season 2 and...
I don't even know if that's season 2 looking at the picture now I think that might be the Kinect Sports season I think it's both season 1 and season 2
Let me see here real quick.
I need to get a better picture of this.
That's a season two.
At least that's what it says on Major Nelson's site.
But it doesn't look like the boxer does not look right.
I think he's full of shit.
That's just me.
Anyways, so yeah, that's going to be coming out.
And so look forward to those.
Also, I guess that is season two.
Now that I look at the picture.
Whatever.
Also, Ubisoft has revealed the Assassin's Creed 4 Season Pass content.
And unlike this time around, we don't get an evil Washington.
Instead, we get Freedom Cry, a nine-mission single-player campaign starring a new protagonist, Edward Kenway's first mate, let's say, Aidwhale.
And he is an escaped slave.
So that's going to be coming, I guess, 1999 for the season pass.
Cool.
And they have an exclusive Kraken ship pack.
Do you get to yell, release the Kraken?
Yes, you do.
You get to yell that.
That's what it's all about.
What about the whole fact that the Assassin's Creed DLC is not coming to Wii U?
The only thing...
The only thing I can think of is that there must be some sort of funky infrastructure that they have to put in there.
Maybe they have to tweak some stuff.
Yes, this is the tinfoil hat guy in me.
And, you know, judge me all you want, but I am convinced that there is something in Nintendo's online infrastructure that is not conducive to the DLC thing like Sony and Microsoft.
I don't know what it is.
Maybe it's the cut that they take or something.
Or maybe it's like, you know...
well I would think even if the cut wasn't that good I still think it would want to do that maybe it's some sort of exclusive I don't know I don't know what it is but yeah I know a lot of games come out for the Wii U and they don't have DLC packed in there I don't think it's the cut or anything or it wouldn't be so appealing to indie developers though like I almost wonder if it's something about the process but indie developers don't do DLC for their games usually true true
Alright, anyhow, so the tinfoil speculation continues all around the internet.
Meanwhile, a game that's coming out for the Xbox One that some people are looking forward to, Killer Instinct.
Killer Instinct will be doing their balance updates on the fly.
In other words, they're talking about doing the cloud.
They're talking about they're updating immediately through the cloud.
And all the variables that talk about how a character behaves are going to exist in the cloud.
And this is according to producer Torin Rettig, talking to Game Informer.
So what I'm hearing is that it is patching.
They're just really small files.
They're patches, but they're not like PlayStation patches that take an hour.
That's fine if they're doing that.
They did that even with some Xbox games got around that where they could tweak stuff.
I remember one of the games we actually talked to people or talked to a developer at E3 about was that Madballs Babbo Invasion game.
Remember that?
They were talking about how they could tweak everything via...
just basically having the game be online they can tweak all the variables I get the idea about tweaking things like in the cloud so to speak like a lot of MMOs do this all the time we call them hot fixes and World of Warcraft and so forth but when I hear like well it's tweaked in the cloud but then there actually are small patches but it's done in the cloud I'm like you use that word cloud and I don't think it means what you think it means you know what it means I don't think it means what you think it means anyway just
Thanks for watching!
Alright, here's the other Kickstarter I teased earlier that I forgot to back and the deadline has passed.
It's River City Ransom Underground.
River City Ransom Underground did make its funding this week.
They raised $180,000 Canadian dollars and that will ensure that they will be able to get the game onto the PC.
So yeah, there it goes.
So congratulations to them.
Look forward to being able to play the game.
And lastly, here's a game I am very excited about on the 3DS.
I am more excited about this game than Pokemon.
Sorry about it, but this is far more important than Pokemon X and Y. I don't care if you're going to judge me for that, because this is Zelda A Link Between Worlds.
I am very excited about this.
There was a new trailer shown this week that actually shows that some of the ways that you have that link between worlds, because obviously in the teaser logo you have the light Triforce and the dark Triforce.
Well, in this new teaser, you see Link literally slipping through cracks.
Because, you know, it's that whole thing where he can kind of press himself up against a wall like paper.
And he goes from Hyrule to Lorule is the name of the other world, it seems like.
Get it?
High?
Low?
Ah, her.
Anyhow, whatever.
As long as the game's good, I don't care what they call the world.
So there it is.
And I guess there is a new villain in the game, too.
But I kind of go, sure, there's a new villain.
Sure, it's a new villain.
It'll fucking be Ganon.
Somehow.
Or something controlled by Ganon or whatever.
But anyhow, the release date of the game, November 22nd.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Stryder, yo
and some other indie developers and let them check out some of the Kickstarter games like Broken Age and another untitled game.
And so it's basically just hang out with us, play some games.
We're cool people.
You like us.
So hurry for Double Vine.
and then Ed Boon who developed Injustice and he was our Mortal Kombat dude.
He basically said on Twitter that he wanted to create a Mortal Kombat vs. Street Fighter and that he's reached out to Capcom to see if they would be interested but they have not replied yet.
I don't know that that would be something that...
Capcom would go for do it because I mean if they do it they're the same route as they did like with Injustice well not Injustice but like Mortal Kombat versus DC where it's kind of pussified where they just you know make it teen rated and not so violent then they could probably get away with it because I think the whole thing was well we don't want to have you know these guys doing fatalities on you know Street Fighter characters or even I think DC does the same thing we don't want we don't want Scorpion ripping the head off of Superman because that's just not realistic
I still thought it was funny that they put in the original Joker fatality later on.
The full thing.
That was pretty cool.
And then something that a lot of people are excited for is that the Final Fantasy X and X-2 HD remasters are going to be out in Japan in December.
They will be out for Vita and PS3 and the date for release is December 26th.
So I'm hoping that we're going to get it soon after over here in the U.S.,
Yay!
There was much rejoicing.
That's the only upcoming game that I had tentative for this year that I still don't know what the date is.
I keep asking, too.
I would assume it'd have to be... Assuming they're localizing it around the same time as the current development, then I would assume sometime in January, February.
Alrighty.
I'm really looking forward to those games, but I'm okay if it takes until after the holidays to finish it.
I still didn't even play through Kingdom Hearts.
Final Fantasy XIV derailed all my gaming stuff.
I gotta get back on board with the other stuff.
Rob, you still have to play XIV with me.
Make me... No, I'm just kidding.
Alan can run dungeons now too, so I'm trying to get him up to speed and then maybe we can all do stuff.
I'll make you a sandwich if you play.
Cool, I love sandwiches.
But not right now.
Alright, let's get to the Fugle Question of the Week, you guys.
Every week we ask a question of our Facebook and our Google Plus communities.
You take those words and throw them together and you get Foogle.
So it's time for the Foogle question of the week.
And that question is, knowing the interview we had earlier tonight, we kind of stuck with the theme here.
The question is, do you currently or have you in the past subscribed to any video game magazines?
Which ones?
Do you have a particularly favorite issue?
And, uh, yeah, so we got a lot of responses to this.
I don't have time to read all these answers, I'm very sorry.
So I'm going to really encourage you to go to our Facebook community at facebook.com slash orange launch radio and our Google Plus community to check out the answers.
I'm going to try to read some of these, and I'm going to try to pick names I don't see very often, just to cycle through some different voices I don't always see in chat or other places.
So starting with Gaming Nerd on Facebook says...
Let's see.
Let's see.
Unfolded Raptor says, I subscribed to Nintendo Power and Electronic Gaming Monthly and have kept every issue, but the story behind my favorite issue is interesting.
In October 2004, issue 183 of EGM, they interviewed a girl by the name of Rachel Moore who was talking about horror games and wearing a Tony Hawk's Underground shirt.
About 2006, I discovered Orange Lounge Radio randomly and started listening to you on my PSP.
This got my interest started in gaming podcasts and eventually I wound up on AllGames.com, which is where we were previously.
and listen to both OLR and All Games Interactive.
Then move to Dead Pixel and Spooky Hour Horror Hour where Rachel Moore was a host.
I didn't think much of it at the time and I didn't put it all together until I was looking back at my old gaming magazines and had a holy shit moment because this girl I was listening to was way bigger than I thought and I knew her before even if I didn't realize it.
Now it's kept in a safe place.
Then imagine my shock when I heard OLR was moving to AllGames.com.
It was amazing.
And now we have VOG.
DarkSakura.com
Elliot B says I had a subscription to Edge Magazine for over a decade now and it's still very much worth reading always has interesting features and stunning design especially the gorgeous glossy covers though I sometimes miss the days when it was pretentious enough to refer to itself in third person
Amanda R replies and says,
Game Informer and Nintendo Power
My favorite issue would have to be Nintendo Power 172 because they featured some envelope art that I submitted.
It was the happiest moment of my young life.
And lastly, we'll read an answer here from Veronica S, who says, I used to subscribe to Nintendo Power back in the GameCube days, but I got tired of reading it, so I unsubscribed.
Now I subscribe to Nintendo Force, the all-new spiritual successor to Nintendo Power.
Thank you guys for the answers.
A lot of love for Nintendo Power across the board, I noticed, which doesn't surprise me one bit.
That's certainly one that's near and dear to my heart.
You know, I got in trouble when I was in fourth grade over an issue of Nintendo Power.
Really?
Yeah, because I had it out in class and I was showing friends.
It was the controversial issue with Simon's Quest on the cover.
It was only like issue four or something, but parents were very upset that there was skulls and imagery on the cover of a magazine like this.
I had one of the big guides for Mario Paint.
Oh yeah, I remember that one.
It had the songs in it you could put in the game.
The songs, it had a bunch of bitmap stuff for all the different characters.
It was pretty cool.
For the record, there was a magazine that I was super into that had a short run, but it was gorgeous in its production value and their designers were freaking brilliant.
Do you remember Play?
Play?
I think I still see that magazine in places.
Yeah, I know that magazine.
I don't know if it's still in print.
Well, not like new, but like collectors, things.
But they had gorgeous spreads.
I mean, the design in that magazine was so top-notch.
That's really one of... I've actually used examples from that magazine in some of my own layouts.
Borrowed ideas from it because it was such a... And it was very well-written on top of that.
Mm-hmm.
Alrighty, well let's move on with some more news stories.
Loki.
Alright.
So let's talk a little bit about a follow-up kind of what we talked about last week with the whole Neo Geo X plug-and-play thing.
Remember we were talking that they were basically ending their contract with Tomo and Tomo wouldn't be able to create these Neo Geo X portable systems and the dock and stuff that actually looks like the Neo Geo system and the controller and all that.
Well, Tomo denies that there was any sort of breach of contract at all, and actually, they're just going to continue selling the Neo Geo X anyways.
Apparently, there's been some comments, I guess, from people that had other agreements with SNK previously, saying that they've retracted, I guess...
they've tried to pull this kind of thing with other companies with licensing but it says they recently extended their licensing agreement through 2016 and that they're going to basically keep publishing that stuff or making those things until their contract runs up despite what SNK is saying because I guess there would be a breach of contract this is kind of interesting and so they're saying that you know
Basically, they're still taking care of, I guess, all the warranties of those systems.
It says, we're continuing to sell Neo Geo X products, including Neo Geo X Gold System, Arcade Stick, Mega Pack, Classic Volumes 1 through 5.
It says, a license agreement which allows Tomo to sell and market these products remains in effect.
So, that's kind of interesting.
Yeah, but I like that they're not going out without a fight.
This is pretty cool.
Well, I mean, if they've got a contract that they signed and then all of a sudden, you know, SNK is saying, well, no, we don't want to do that anymore.
Unless they have, like, a legal out in that contract, I don't see how they can just say, no, we're not going to follow through with that contract.
Right, right.
I mean, come on.
I don't know why they would do that in the first place.
They don't want the new GOB out there?
I don't know what their plan is.
All right.
I guess we'll see how this plays out.
Yeah, and maybe your chance isn't up to get one of these systems after all.
All right.
Well, anyhow, DarkSakura, I know you like the ColecoVision.
Yes.
So I'm sure this news has you either very excited or very scared.
There's going to be an iOS app.
That is going to invoke the ColecoVision through emulation and all that It was on Kickstarter, I guess, at one point Oh no, it is right now, actually Trying to seek... I thought that this was already funded, but I guess not They were doing this whole little countdown thing And I thought, oh, they're going to unveil the app Well, I guess they unveiled the Kickstarter But it's Rant Media Games who did the original Vetrex Regeneration Which is a pretty good little app if you played it
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Check out the box art, check out the cartridge.
The Vetrex one is pretty cool, if you haven't already played it.
They do have the rights to 19 different games.
And sorry, Casey Munchkin is not one of them.
Well, Casey Munchkin wasn't on the Clicovision.
Wasn't?
I thought that was the Clicovision.
That was the Magnavox Odyssey, too.
I don't know, man.
Son of a bitch.
All the games that they have lists on here, I'm quite excited for, actually, now that I look at the list.
Space Fury.
I had an Atari 2600, so all those other systems kind of blurred together for me.
Space Fury is one of my favorite ClicoVision games.
Well, there are some pretty good ones that I even noticed here, like Bump and Jump.
I remember that.
Jumpman and Jumpman Jr.
I certainly remember from the 64.
Montezuma's Revenge.
Oh, my God.
That was a huge game.
Zaxxon.
What's the one you're looking at, Loki?
Well, I used to play a ton of Bump and Jump and actually a ton of Jumpman Jr., Frenzy, Space Fury, and Zaxxon.
I think I've played, and Pepper too, I think I've actually played most of these games.
Except for Antarctic Adventure, I don't recognize that or Destructor.
There are two games that I would want to be on that list.
And one of them would be Venture.
And the other one would be Gorf.
I would put money into it if they had Gorf.
And I love the little, like, the boxing.
They have a bunch of different animated banners and stuff.
And for platforms, they have the Rocky IV game on there, which is awesome.
They have the special controller for it and everything.
All right.
so um they're looking for a quarter million dollars on kickstarter they've got five thousand after the first five days which is supposed to be like kind of like the biggest push i don't know i'm gonna be just completely honest i think a quarter million is too much money for a project like this and i understand they justify it and i
you know it's not that I'm thinking like oh you know they're not like they're asking for too much money and we don't really know where it's going I get it they got to get the licensing and all this stuff and that's where a bunch of it is going so that the whole thing is legal and all that but I just think at the end of the day you're going to ask for a quarter million dollars for an iOS app of a system that is so old and I just I don't think there's going to be enough people that are interested I'm sorry like I know that sounds really cruel but especially when we were talking about a lot of retro love earlier but
That's, yeah, I don't think they're going to hit it.
If they do, great, more power to them, and I would love to check out the game when it comes out, but I don't know.
It's a lot of money to try and get off Kickstarter.
What do you guys think?
Do you think I'm right?
Do you think I'm being cruel?
I don't think that they're going to hit it, but I wish it was.
They'd hit it if they had Gorfin Venture.
My thing though is seriously is how these games, I mean because they have a numpad on that thing and then the joystick is really weird so it'd be interesting to see how this is going to translate over to the actual to playing it.
Every time I get excited about a retro game collection on iPad I walk away really disappointed because the touch controls just suck.
Now ever since I got the iCade that's improved things significantly.
Yeah the Vectrex
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
All right, anyhow, sorry to be Debbie Downer.
DarkSakura, what do you got?
Some stuff.
Well, the goddamn stupid iPad.
You get frustrated by the touch controls, too.
You know what?
I think this thing is touched in the head.
So, THQ is suing EA and Zufa.
And what they are suing about this time is... Everybody's fucking suing everybody.
They're suing about the UFC game.
Basically, EA was going to be releasing the EA Sports UFC in 2014.
and because they gained the license for that in June 2012 which was six months before THQ did and so since basically THQ was bankrupt Zufa paid looks like 10 million for breaking the contract
and THQ says that no, we were supposed to receive double that.
So yeah, it's money.
We're bankrupt, we need the money, we need to pay back our attorney fees, that type of thing.
I think for what it was is I think that basically EA had insider information regarding THQ's financial standing and they let the company...
They let the other company know about that and were able to negotiate a better deal because of that.
And so they're pissed off that insider information was leaked out about THQ.
It is kind of funny to see THQ suing
I am THQ It's more like their lawyer I am Spartacus Get off my lawn and give me another 10 million dollars Yeah, seriously, it's whatever lawyer now represents him Seriously, so yeah
Alright, let's move on, Loki.
Alright, so since we've been talking a little bit about crowdfunding, this is kind of interesting.
Square Enix has this new partnership with Indiegogo.
It's called The Collective.
And what it is, is basically this Indiegogo curated page that's going to allow people to vote over the course of 28 days on different project pitches, including rebooting an old franchise from Eidos.
So...
I don't know.
That sounds interesting, I guess.
But it's kind of weird, though, that we have to go to crowdfunding to do that sort of thing.
But whatever.
So basically, you know, you can pitch your ideas to developers.
And if people like those ideas, they may run with it.
You know, whenever I see something like this, it's kind of like, yeah, we've run out of ideas.
Why don't you guys give us ideas and we'll make money off of them.
You know.
Thanks for watching!
I'm assuming since it's partnered with Indiegogo, does that mean we have to fund it too?
Are we going to have to fund this game that you're going to make money off of?
It's a little weird, isn't it?
You're a big company, and you can't... You don't really have a say in it, you just pre-order it.
You're at the point where you're like, yeah, it's a big company, we're just not going to take any risks anymore.
We're going to let you take the risks for us.
That's kind of what it sounds like to me.
So many pitches free.
If you're actually interested in this whole thing, collective.square-enix.com Check it out.
There might be some cool ideas there.
As long as they're not asking us to crowdfund all the bravest too, we'll be fine.
Thanks for watching!
He was talking about, in an interview with, I guess, I'm not sure where it was.
Was it a Japanese magazine or what?
Sorry, I can't properly credit this here.
He was talking about the Kickstarter success and that if Capcom were to make an offer about publishing the game, he would go with Capcom.
And saying, quote, there is no reason not to publish with Capcom.
he also talked about possibly turning this into a Mega Man title if Capcom possibly wanted to go that way now he is more hesitant about this idea but he didn't come out and exactly say no to it which the gaming media is like kind of leeching onto a bit too much I think but whatever it says he and his crew really want this to be their thing
so I kind of think we're grabbing on a little too much about the quote that you know if Capcom want to make it a Mega Man game I just I really think that was a poor decision to even let that thought go out there because like seriously like I crowdfunded all this stuff just for this to come out and be another Mega Man game don't get me wrong I like Mega Man but it's like it's weird I just don't think that they could do this at this point because how would they go about making this be a Mega Man I guess other than calling it Mega Man I mean
Thanks for watching!
Um, but, I don't know, I mean, maybe the joke is that it's so close to Mega Man, you might as well just call it Mega Man, you know, and if Capcom paid them some money, they'll just call it Mega Man, and it'll be a Mega Man game, because it's essentially Mega Man.
I think they're drawing straws.
All right.
I'm going to pause recording here real quick because unfortunately our stream is down at server room.
Oh, thank you, server room.
I know, right?
So we'll be right back here after a quick... For the podcast listeners, we'll be right back after a quick little music note here.
And we'll talk a little more about this and some other news.
All right, and we're back here at Orange Lounge Radio.
Unfortunately, some technical difficulties that were a little bit out of our control.
We'll be following up with our hosting provider this week and figuring out why on two Sundays in a row they have decided to reset the server or whatever they're doing that is causing the show to drop out.
And if they can't give us a good answer, we will look into a different provider for a future broadcast.
In the meantime...
Let's get back where we left off.
We've been talking about Mighty No.
9 and the whole Mega Man thing and the fact that it was Kickstarted.
And the only other thing I wanted to get out with this is that I get why he says if Capcom makes the best publishing deal, then that's the company they're going to go with.
That's just business, right?
I don't think they're going to be.
I think that was kind of like interview bait I think somebody baited him to say that for a headline like oh Mighty No.
9 is going to go through Capcom and it's going to be ironic it probably won't it could but I mean the way Capcom's been going lately and the fact that they you know kind of denied this guy the Mega Man game he wants to make do you think they're really going to come back and make the best deal to publish it probably not I think somebody else will and that'll be that so all right
Anyhow, let's move on to our mailbag.
Every week you guys send us emails.
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com And we go through the mailbag and try to read some of our favorite emails here live.
DarkSakura, dive into that mailbag.
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com And tell us what emails we have tonight.
We have a few.
I will start with the first one from the Nasty Canasta.
Hi, OLR.
I'd like to give my impressions on a game that's soon to be re-released, Deus Ex Human Revolution.
I was sitting in my big-ass PC backlog for nearly two years when I finally got around to playing it.
I sunk a solid hundred hours into it within the span of a month.
This is going into the story.
I'm going to skip forward because I don't want to spoil for anyone who might play it.
So a game with an engaging plot needs some kickass gameplay to back it up, and Deus Ex delivers for the most part.
In this first-person RPG, you can be gung-ho by making use of the guns to blast the shit out of people, take a more merciful route by knocking out enemies, sneaking, and hacking your way through areas, or a combination of all three.
It is up to you to play however you want, though you'll be making progressively harder choices as you get closer to the end.
For the record, I watched Becky's husband play through a little bit of this.
It was really good.
Now, I say the game delivers for the most part, because there are some significant flaws.
First, the games occasionally bug you with handling ragdolls, especially when they clip and get stuck in floors.
Icky.
Second, while the game rewards XP for various actions you do, you are awarded the most points for playing pacifist with stealth.
Although you can play however you want, the XP rewards are pretty much big neon signs saying, "'Want this augmentation?
Do melee takedowns, bro!'
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Despite these problems, I highly encourage everyone to try it out, especially if you have a PC or got the game through PlayStation Plus.
The re-release fixes boss fights for pacifist players.
has touchscreen players for all platforms, Wii U, Game Pass, Smart Glass, PS3, Vita, Cross Control, and TBA for PC, and bundles in all the DLC content.
And before I forget, the game looks absolutely gorgeous and the soundtrack is fantastic.
And that comes from the nasty Canasta.
So, next email?
Yes.
Yes.
and my bigger hands.
It's minimalist design features and price are all I'm looking for in a system to play on the couch at home or throw my laptop bag on the go.
I think anyone wanting to get access to the 3DS library and doesn't care about 3D should at least consider a 2DS as I personally think it is the best feeling portable in some time.
Also, the $70 cheaper price more than makes up for the smaller screen than the XL.
On a side note, I'm already six hours into Pokemon and I'm not the type of gamer that typically plays that much at a time.
I haven't played a Pokemon game since the GBA, so I'm not exactly the typical Pokemon fanatic either.
So while lots of people are talking next gen, I'm going to be perfectly happy with my new Wii U and 2DS combo for the foreseeable future.
I can't wait for Super Mario 3D World and the new Legend of Zelda for 3DS.
Love the show.
Take care.
Monty Boggs.
I'm glad that you're enjoying it.
It sounds like he is quite in joy.
Quite in joy.
Quite in joy.
Alright, we have two emails left.
One of them is long.
Kinda long.
Hello, OLR gang.
This is my first time giving my voice to the show, being on the East Coast and having to be up Monday at 5.30am.
I'm not able to listen to your show live.
I do, however, listen to every episode while I'm at work every Monday morning.
Well, I'm glad you do.
Thank you.
I am a 34-year-old gamer who started gaming fairly late compared to you guys.
My first console was the original Oness.
My parents were not a fan of me spending time on gaming and not interacting with people, so I never got another console until I was older and able to purchase my own.
Good choices.
Dark Ages of Camelot
I've played WoW, Star Wars Galaxy, Star Wars The Old Republic, Champions Online, Guild Wars 2, Neverwinter, just to name a few.
I'm sure there are more that I'm forgetting about.
Currently I decided to see what all the hype about Mass Effect was all about so I purchased the trilogy during the summer months when it was on sale.
I've played through all of Mass Effect 1 and 2 and I'm currently working on 3.
I do have to say I've enjoyed the storyline but there are some things that annoy me about the games like in Mass Effect 2 and Mass Effect 3.
Not being able to open the journal without hitting escape and then clicking the journal menu item.
Why couldn't they make a keybind for stuff like that?
By the way, I think some of the menu differences in that were just with the differences of the Unreal Engine.
I do believe.
Because you'll notice also their texture rendering was different.
A lot of the menu systems are different.
um also I think if you are playing on PC you can create a bind to load your journal but you have to mod your um uh your coalesced INI to put that in there and if you go to my tumblr massaffecting.tumblr.com I will see if I can find the answer to that and show you how to make the key bind might even share my own coalesced INI with you um
Just saying, because I totally end up modding my games.
Anyways, enough about me.
I thought I was about to say Mass Effect, but it's actually me.
My question for you guys to ponder, with Valve's latest announcements about the Steam Machine and SteamOS, do you think this could have game makers start considering PC gaming as a viable competitor in the console war?
With a five-year-old daughter, I have had to focus my gaming on PC.
With a second child on the way in June, I've had to put my plans to purchase the next gen in the new year on the back burner.
By the way, congratulations.
I do however have a fairly powerful i5 dual core with 60 gigabytes of RAM PC that I thought could handle most of the games that will be coming out I'm hoping my thoughts on the Steam machines and Steam OS bringing PC gaming into direct competition with consoles is true so more games will come out for PC and the ones that do come out will come out around the same times as console unlike GTA 5 um
Don't you think?
If you think that the oncoming Steam Box and Steam OS will cause PC gaming to be more of a competitor to the console market
I don't think so.
It's so early to say because the price is a huge motivator in that regard.
I don't know.
The Steam Machine is trying to take things closer to a dedicated game processor and device, but it's not really one.
It's more dedicated than maybe a Windows machine is, but it's not solely dedicated like a PlayStation or an Xbox is.
So I'm not sure that certain things that you do on a gaming console will necessarily be possible on one of these devices.
I don't know.
I sort of just think there's still room for the consoles.
I think there's some potential there, but what my point was is that a lot of times when you're dealing with the consumer market, people are slow to switch up what works.
They don't want to make the big risk unless they're completely desperate.
Anyway, thanks for the great shows.
I love listening to the many shows on VOG including Bobby Show, OLR, and Horde House.
The shows help to make my work week a lot more interesting and have a great one, Cyber Judge.
Thank you for emailing us.
Thank you.
I like hearing from the veterans and the people that talk to us frequently but I like hearing from new people too.
I really like hearing from new people.
Although I love all of you guys.
Hey guys!
Hey!
So I've been trying to get into gaming, but even though I have a dual box MacBook Pro, I still wonder what game I should play since I am broke as a joke.
I mean, I know Final Fantasy XIV is out, but I cannot afford it.
I enjoyed it during the open beta, but a connection, etc.
issue kept me from really enjoying it.
I wish I could afford it while I'm looking for a job, but it's going to be a little hard for me too.
What do you guys think that it's...
Do you guys think that it's one of those games that will last for a while like Eleven did?
Is there any Mac or PC games you think I should try in your opinion?
That's free.
Thank you for answering me.
If so, you're a listener of many years.
Uni.
Well, if your computer is solid enough to run Final Fantasy XIV at all during the beta, then there's a lot of free-to-play stuff out there that you can check out.
And some of those are, you know, MMO-type things.
I mean, you've got Star Wars, The Old Republic.
I don't know how many of these are on Mac.
That's the problem.
Ragnarok Online, I think, might.
Ragnarok 2, anyway.
But I used to play the old-school Ragnarok Online through free servers on a Mac using an emulator.
Star Wars The Old Republic, Rift
more MMOs even things like Star Trek Online Marvel Heroes is a pretty fun to play one if you like Diablo at all and you like your comic book people that's free to play as well even things that are like up a totally different alley like Spiral Knights for Sega is there you know there's there's more and more free to play stuff on Steam that's worth checking out and Steam's gonna make it very clear what's on Mac and what's not and you can also if it's still going on the not on Steam sale because I do believe there were some Mac titles included in that
Right.
They weren't free, but they were pretty cheap.
Low, low cost, yeah.
They were pretty cheap.
Yeah.
Don't be afraid to play stuff that's maybe under the radar, because there's some great indie games and things that, you know, maybe not everybody's necessarily into right at this moment that are still worth you checking out.
I also do suggest installing, what is it called, for, not Flash, but it's a game engine that runs through browsers that the Disney games, like the Wreck-It-Ralph games used.
Oh.
Uni's actually in our chat right now saying that she has dual boxed Windows 7 and Mac Mountain Lion.
Oh, well then you're good for a lot of these games we're talking.
If you want MMOs, I would say check out The Old Republic if you even remotely like Bioware games or Star Wars.
I don't think you necessarily even have to like Star Wars to enjoy The Old Republic.
I still think it's a pretty good game on its own.
And Rift for sure.
If you liked Warcraft, you'd probably like Rift.
And someone might gift you Mass Effect when it goes for sale again.
Somebody super nice.
Yeah, there's a really nice person sitting at this table right now.
DungeonBuster in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says Neverwinter is a pretty decent free-to-play Dungeons & Dragons MMO.
Yes, I've heard of that one too.
It's Unity.
That's what I thought it was, but I didn't quite want to call it.
Maybe you're wrong.
So is that it for emails?
Yarp.
There you go.
Mailbag at orangeloundtrader.com if you have a question for a future week.
All right, let's do the FUs of the week, folks.
Because we're mad.
F you to my stepdad.
And to put this in the most general of terms, just because somebody else doesn't believe something that you do or doesn't agree with you does not mean that they're closed-minded.
For all you know, they could have done their research and found that it's not for them.
Using inflammatory statements to try to guilt trip somebody into changing their opinion or into evoking an emotional response that makes you look like you're staying calm is no way to have a discussion.
It's immature and it is beneath you and I am done.
What you showed me was pretty tacky.
That's really the best word I can think of for it.
Tacky.
Loki.
Uh... I don't know.
F you to...
It's become your life.
F you to the fact that I don't have a voice today.
F you to stress making me sick when I eat.
And F you to the fact that our show cut out while we're trying to do it.
I hate that.
Especially when it's out of our control.
Rawr.
Definitely a suitable FU of the week Alright, a couple more stories for you guys Then we'll open up the skyline for a little bit And try to do some Twitter topics as well too I'm going to warn you guys with this If you want to get in on the skyline tonight You need to call as soon as we open it up Because we're not going to be able to sit around tonight And wait for seven minutes going Is somebody going to call?
So either you want to participate or you don't tonight You have a ten second window You better be on it But after two stories So Loki, you first
So despite some sort of delay in the whole purchasing process thanks to the Delaware Supreme Court, the ruling has been made in favor of Activision.
And yes, they will be allowed to buy the, I guess, $8.2 billion of their own shares from Vivendi in just a few days here on October 15th.
So...
They will become their own company again, I guess.
Or more of their own company.
So I remember hearing about this before a little bit.
So the news here is that it's been approved, basically.
Because there was concern.
It was a shareholder.
It was one of the shareholders that was saying that they were doing this to somehow...
I don't know, somehow screw them out of money or something.
I don't know how it was.
But yeah, it basically got overturned so they can do it.
Alright.
Uh, well, you know what, all the changes I've seen in World of Warcraft ever since this split have been for the better, so, and Diablo 3, hello, Auction House going away, that's great news, that's gonna bring a whole group of new people into the game, so, we'll see.
Meanwhile, hey, Wii U owners, I know you have been waiting for that killer game that will finally just make this thing fuckin' fly off of shelves, and, uh, you know, it might be, it might be, you know, Mario 3D World 2 or whatever, it could be, it could be, uh, Mario Kart 8,
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Well, you can totally get a jacked version of Rainbow Road from the Mario Kart games with little Hello Kitty space planets.
I don't know what else to call these things.
From the back room.
I wonder if you can play as little twin stars.
Who knows?
Anything's possible.
So there are some screenshots available and yeah, you can check that out coming later this year.
I don't know how much and I don't know exactly what day, but it's Hello Kitty.
Oh, it's November 5th?
And how much?
I think it's $40 if I remember correctly.
The countdown is on and it's a slight budget title.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I don't know.
Yes.
Remember when Sony went down for an entire day and everybody said, I'll never buy another Sony product again, and then they unveiled the PlayStation 4, and everybody was like, oh, never mind.
I'm just kidding.
Yeah, Sony went down for a long time.
Remember when they had a problem with their clocks?
Yep.
All right, anyhow, let's do it.
Let's get to some phone calls.
1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio, but we already have a call coming in, so let's get to it.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
Yo guys, it's Xenacore from OKC.
How you doing?
Hey, Xenacore.
Good to hear from you as always.
How are you?
We're good.
It's good to know I know about the right time for the delay in the radio to pick up.
You've got this down to a science.
You beat Ranma tonight.
That's something.
Oh, cool.
I'll put that on my list.
All right, give yourself a gold star.
All right, what's on your mind, buddy?
The web game for the fan-made attack on Titan game.
That thing is actually pretty damn polished.
I was surprised.
Hmm.
Have you guys not seen it yet?
No, I haven't.
Tell us a little more about this.
I haven't been into the anime at all, so I've been pretty much ignoring it on Tumblr.
Some guy used the Unity engine to make a fan-inspired version of Defending Humanity against the Titans, and it's pretty damn good.
It plays really well.
It almost feels like Spider-Man as far as the swinging mechanic is down.
It's really intuitive after a couple matches, and it's just as deadly as the real game is.
Yeah, I highly encourage everybody to play it.
How much is that?
Is that a free one?
Oh yeah, it's free.
This guy just made it and threw it up on the interwebs just because he loves the game.
I just threw the link up there in chat if anyone wants to check it out.
It's fangly.com slash game slash AOG.
Well, there's something for the emailer a little bit ago who was looking for some free games to play.
There you go.
Yeah, there you go.
What else have you been playing lately?
That and some War Thunder Online just to get my air-to-air combat genes taken care of.
Mm-hmm.
That's done pretty well.
They're getting ready to release the tanks too.
Apparently they're trying to do both land, sea, and air battles all in one massive arena game all of World War II.
So it's quite extensive.
It's really good.
Are you a fan pretty regularly of these air fighting games?
Like Ace Combat stuff?
Every once in a while.
I mean, they just now started popping up.
I guess since League of Legends took over, everybody's doing their own version of a massive online battle arena.
Oh, I didn't even realize they kind of did that in airplane form.
Yeah, I mean, you just spawn in everybody, depending on what army you're with, you pick a side, you fight it out, and sooner or later somebody wins the battle, and that's it.
That's kind of cool.
Gosh, I don't remember the last time I seriously played an airplane combat game like that.
It was probably Top Gun on the NES, and you go into that intense rage when you can't refuel your damn plane.
Oh yeah, most definitely.
And since this one's free on Steam, it's bound to be picking up tons of people, especially with this next expansion when they add tanks.
They just teased it over in one of the Russian cons, so it looks quite good.
I'm all about free.
Steam is really developing a nice little free library on there.
It's pretty cool.
So that's going to be the neat thing when they get that Steam machine out there.
It's going to be a huge marketing thing for them is that, hey, all you have to do is buy the system and you can get all these games for free because they're all free.
So it's a great way to market stuff.
So that's what I've been up to, man.
Y'all take it easy.
Excellent show.
All right.
It's awesome to hear from you as always.
Take care.
All right.
Bye.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Nevermind, but I will get to tweets and last minute stories here in a minute First, let me go to the phones Hi, you're on Orange Silence Radio, who's this?
Hey, it's Ranma Hey buddy, you got beat tonight Well, that's because I'm still dealing with stuff from New York Comic Con, so... Excuses, excuses Alright, well tell us about the con already, how was it?
It was pretty good, I have to admit for a Saturday It wasn't as crowded as I thought it was Really?
Yeah Is that because everybody was so pissed off that their Twitters were tweeting things that they weren't intending on saying about the show?
I just, I heard about this I want you to know, when you register your badge, you can opt out of that And we all know, not everybody reads the fine print You fill out the form, you spin down to the end that you accept and you acknowledge Add this, add that, done
Did you guys hear about this?
What happened?
The people that were registering for New York Comic Con, I don't know why, but they were tying their Twitter accounts or something to the registration.
And when the smartphones picked up that these guys were at the convention, it would automatically tweet, I'm having a great time in New York Comic Con.
And people were pissed.
that this thing was tweeting for well it's stupid they shut it down in like 12 hours that's that intrusive advertising we were talking about earlier not smart so anyway sorry now that we got the little dark cloud around Comic Con out of the way tell us more about the good stuff not to mention the other dark cloud around Comic Con
DarkSakura.com
Alright, but for real, tell us some good news out of New York Comic Con, for heaven's sake.
The re-release of Ranma 1F on Blu-ray.
Oh, that sounds nice.
Yes.
I was asked to be a part of a retrospective that Viz is putting out, and we got a chance to see some screenshots between a DVD and a Blu-ray.
It looks beautiful.
And for Ook-chan's sake...
They're re-subbing the episodes.
Ooh, happy.
Yes.
Yes.
I hope they're more accurate.
Yes, you're going to shed a tear when you watch this.
Yay, I need this then.
This has to be a part of my life.
So were they actually showing this at Comic-Con, the new Blu-ray?
Yeah, they actually showed it on, I think, Thursday or Friday, because I only had a one-day badge, and everyone was talking about how much they saw it, and I'm like, I hate you guys.
Nice, and you know, your name is DJ Ranma S, so you have a slight passing interest in things related to this series, right?
Yeah, pretty much.
I think one of the reasons why it wasn't as crowded Saturday is because in order for you to get into the con, you had to check in.
The check-in areas were outside in the parking lot areas in front of the convention center.
Because when I walked in, they finally incorporated the queue room type setup for everybody to go into.
And from that, it just kind of flowed like water.
What is the secret to not getting a backed up as hell line at your convention?
You've been to enough conventions.
I think that would be it, the queue line, because when it comes to cons, people will say, they will say on the site, pre-regs at this time, people will show up at one to two hours prior to
Just to get their badge.
Especially for Otakon.
Because during the summer in Baltimore, the temperature tends to hit triple digits.
And I have seen people out there for three and four hours at a time.
And pretty much in full costume.
It's the same way at AX.
That's why this sort of thing started for a little bit of your registration line costume.
No, for real.
It's a variation of a costume or a character that you're doing that is more comfortable to wear in line but still is, you know, acceptable to wear out in the triple digits.
Yeah, pretty much.
Between you and me, I'd rather get to the hotel, relax for a few hours, then head on over, pick up my badge, and then go meet up with friends to eat.
I'd rather do that.
I like when AX started doing day before pre-reg.
Where you could pick up your badges the day before the convention for everyone who pre-registered so that the lines were left for regular registration.
Yeah, well, but what things what's happening now is even if you pre-reg and you pick up the day before, you think that would help?
No, you still have people who show up the day of and are usually out there at 5 o'clock in the morning just to get a badge.
Meanwhile, doors aren't open until 9.
Word of advice, don't wear combat boots that are not adjusted to your feet in line for registration or masquerade.
There is a meme I wrote about that I have to post on your wall.
You'll appreciate it.
Just remind me to tell you sometime about the days of my Jill Valentine costume.
Will do.
Playing DDR in combat boots is not fun.
Sorry.
I beat that dress as Ranma.
Those sandals, I will never do it again.
Sorry I got really quiet there, but I took a moment to go visit the news source that I should have been watching this whole time, Jamie's Tumblr, to read about what happened in New York Comic Con.
My eyes just rolled so far in the back of my head I can see my brain.
Like...
I'm infuriated by it.
It's just like, I can't.
I can't.
That's all I can say.
I'm just like, I can't believe.
I still see how people can think that doing something like that is okay.
Here's the thing is that somebody in a room somewhere said, and just if you guys don't know this cosplayer, again, I'm like totally reeling.
We're going to leave the bulk of the story for Ranma.
Yes, we will.
This cosplayer that was at the convention was basically sexually harassed by this television crew that was trying to film her boobs and things like this.
Just really stupid shit.
But the thing that gets me is that I'm like, somebody sat in a room and said, this is a good idea.
And for the record, this is why we still need feminism.
Just saying.
This is why we need common sense.
And Rob, multiple reports came about that group right after this popped up.
And now they're playing chicken saying, well, we're not ever going to go back again.
They shouldn't exist.
That's a little...
Alright, I will keep my mouth shut and let you have the say Tuesdays on Out of My Jam Session.
I would love to rant if I didn't have school on Tuesday.
I would love to call in and rant.
You might need to do a pre-taped segment or something.
You are more than welcome to write up an article for my site if you'd like.
We'll see.
Alright.
But let's get back on track here and I'll make this part brief and I'll get out of here because one thing I have noticed on Saturday is
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
That's, I, again, I'm just, I mean, that doesn't make me sad in the same way the other thing made me sad, but it's just like, I just, I weep that Strider, no one cares.
I really hope the sales don't reflect that.
I doubt it.
But also, everybody was going nuts at the Ubisoft display because they had Just Dance 2014 out.
Oh boy.
And I just noticed while I was recording footage of people dancing, they had some, I think a pinball, PC pinball gaming contest going on.
This girl won and walked away with a high-end NVIDIA PC and I thought that was pretty cool.
Nice.
I think it's pretty cool, there's an ABBA song in Just Dance 2014, just saying alright, Ranma, we gotta we gotta let you go so we can wrap up the show, but tune in to Anime Jam Session Tuesday at 6.30 Pacific 9.30 Eastern, right after Electric Sisterhood here on VOG alright, take care buddy you too
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Alright then, let's get to the Twitters as soon as I can bring it up Alright, so Bobby linked us to this article that says Because we all love lists And it was literally a list of Game of Thrones characters as video game consoles Now, I don't watch Game of Thrones, so I kind of looked at the list going, doesn't make sense to me But it just seems like the type of thing that they're intentionally baiting people to share on Facebook
Which is kind of what some of the internet's turned into And some of what Facebook's turned into And I don't know I want to talk about this tweet from Actdeft Because I heard about this too Actdeft tweets us saying I just learned about the existence of a 3DS version of Chocobo Racing And sadly it got canned I did forget they did announce this Like when the 3DS first came out They were like yeah we're going to make a Chocobo Racing game for it Well it came out this week that that game got cancelled
and I'm like, aww I really like the PlayStation game I know it kind of got mixed reviews and some people didn't feel so hot on the game, but I thought the game was really cool so I'm sad they didn't do Chocobo Racing on 3DS, I would have enjoyed it but I guess I'll never get to play it sniff sniff
Let's see, Tigerclaw sends us a link here and I will read this here Russian government to fund patriotic games Interesting, I'm trying to look at this article because I haven't heard about this
He links us to an article at GameSpot.com that says Russia's culture minister says video games have to be conducive to patriotic education and if you distort history you could be banned.
It will help fund the production of patriotic games.
and it's comments from the aid to Russia's culture minister Vladimir Mandinsky said in an interview with a Russian daily newspaper and there are several developers that they're in talks with for games to be released through 2014 you know
This is interesting because you might think, oh, government-funded video games.
What a crazy idea.
Not really because weren't we just hearing on Bobby Blackwolf's show a couple weeks ago?
He was out there at the CDC Game Jam.
I mean, CDC is a government arm.
So obviously it wasn't necessarily funding patriotic games.
It was funding awareness of – but I just thought it was interesting that there's patriotic games of a different sense being made here.
Let's see if there's any other tweets here.
I'll read this very kind tweet from Sutur who says, Oh, thank you.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and I think that'll do it for tweets.
We should have something.
I'm going to start this on the Orange Lounge Tumblr called Show Us Your Pussy.
I want pictures of cats.
There's already a shit ton of those on Tumblr.
My favorite is Get Out of There Cat.
All right.
That's it for Twitter topics.
So that's going to do it for our show tonight.
We're going to wrap on up here.
I want to thank you guys for staying up with us late and listening to the show.
And remember, if you like what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio, we don't make any money off this show.
We don't ask for your money really to do this at all.
Maybe once in a while a charity drive or something.
We don't pocket any money from the show.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
If you did make it this far in the show, then hopefully you did really like what you hear.
The nominations are about to close.
I think we've got like two more days left for the 7th Annual Podcast Awards.
So if you're listening live right now and you haven't done it yet, please consider going to PodcastAwards.com and nominating Orange Lens Radio for People's Choice and Best Gaming.
And if you don't know what to put for the URL, just put OrangeLensRadio.com.
They'll figure it out.
We've been nominated before.
They know who we are.
And yeah, it really helps us spread awareness.
That whole thing I just talked about before, you know, getting the word of mouth out there.
So yeah, would really appreciate it.
But if you decide to nominate somebody else, that's cool too.
Just keep it independent.
That's all we ask.
Keep it independent.
Independents are the ones that need the exposure.
So good luck to everybody.
That's it.
I guess we'll go around and get everybody's final thought for the night and then wrap up and get out of here.
I will give my final thought first tonight.
And my final thought is I'm going to try very hard the rest of this evening to not talk.
But doing this show makes me happy and I'm glad I could push through these past few hours to be here with you tonight.
Loki, your final thought tonight.
I'm going to play lots of Grand Theft Auto 5 this week.
And stay tuned to the forums because we'll have an exact time and day for those VOG gaming nights for Grand Theft Auto Online.
It might be in the middle of the week now.
But we'll see.
Alright.
You've got to figure that out.
And last but not least, DarkSakura, your final thought.
I'm very grumpy.
Sorry to hear it.
Alright, that's it guys.
We're done here at Orange Lounge Radio.
We will be back next week to do it all again.
Have a wonderful week in the meantime and keep on gaming and have fun.
Bye.
You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio
