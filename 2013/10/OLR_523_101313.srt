00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,360
This week, Microsoft denies that Kinect gathers data for advertising. A classic RPG series

2
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:22,520
is headed to iOS and Android, and tonight we interview SoCal Mike Kennedy about Retro

3
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:29,760
Magazine and its Kickstarter campaign. All this and more begins right now.

4
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,840
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

5
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:41,960
where every gamer has a voice. This is Orange Lounge Radio here on October the 13th, 2013

6
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:48,840
with episode number 523 of our program. My name is Rob Roberts joining you over the next

7
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:53,700
few hours to talk about video games, gaming culture, and so on and so on with my co-host,

8
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:57,480
say hello first off to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers. I just thought you were channeling

9
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:01,040
Bea Arthur like you said earlier. I am a little bit. I have the raspy voice

10
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:08,640
going on today. Those of you that follow VOG Network know that Jessica from Understation

11
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,760
Live and I were both involved with a production here in Sacramento at the Rocky Horror Picture

12
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:17,960
Show. Well, that occurred last night and I'm proud to say we sold out. It was 500 plus

13
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:24,280
seats and the cast did an amazing job, but I was the host or MC hosting the whole thing

14
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:29,880
and that involved a lot of screaming. You know the whole thing at the top of my voice

15
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:35,720
and trying to be funny, improv and all that, but it was great and I will say by missing

16
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:40,720
the show you missed this really, I can't even repeat it, but I had to do a Pokemon. That's

17
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:47,000
all I'm going to say. Let's just say. I probably, keep in mind that the shows that I've had

18
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,240
the most fun at were the ones where I did crew stuff. Oh yeah, yeah. I remember you

19
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:57,360
used to do tech related things. Do you play Dr. Scott one time? I was Dr. Scott one time

20
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:03,160
and I was the curtain and the rope and I held the tank up. Last night I played Dr. Scott.

21
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:06,440
I actually played Eddie. It was the first time I played Eddie for about, oh God, the

22
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:10,880
past like, it's probably been like 12 years since I played Eddie, but uh, yeah, good old

23
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:17,080
meatloaf. Yeah. All right. But um, I still think it's ironic that in the original production

24
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:22,840
that he was Dr. Scott and not, he was both. Well, he was, he was both at one point and

25
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:26,720
uh, that's why a lot of movie shadow casts will do both, especially if they're stretched

26
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:32,960
for people like we were. So, but um, but no, I, I have more fun when I'm not looking at

27
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:37,360
the crowd when they're behind me and I'm not looking at a sea of people. See the crowd

28
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,520
thing doesn't bother me at all. That's just, I guess that's just part of my, like, you

29
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:44,480
know, how I'm wired. Like, you know, I'm able to do, well this, this is easy. You are an

30
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,560
attention whore. This is easy. Yeah, but you make it sound like I'm like self centered

31
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,080
or something like that too. And I really like to think I'm not. Some people are fine with

32
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,140
the public speaking thing and it's not that I have a problem with public speaking, although

33
00:02:56,140 --> 00:03:01,140
I actually have a pathological fear of microphones and public speaking. Yet here you are. No

34
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:04,980
microphones and public speaking as in front of a crowd with a microphone. I hate the way

35
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:10,080
my voice sounds amplified. Oh, here in the echo and all that. Exactly. I don't even like

36
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,960
listening to myself in recordings. Yeah. So I actually have to practice modulating

37
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:21,180
my voice. Um, well my voice is definitely be modulated tonight. Well I'm running on

38
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:26,800
four hours of sleep because apparently the insomnia creature decided to bitch slap me

39
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:34,000
and I woke up at like two in the morning, four in the morning, five in the morning.

40
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,720
Then the cat woke me up. So I was like, I don't play mass effect. I spent more time

41
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:43,600
doing screen captures. All right. Let's also, let's also introduce, cause we could talk

42
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:48,400
about coffee and everything else all night long, but we do want to get to video games.

43
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,980
Say hello to tech master Loki. Yeah. Hey, how you doing Loki? I'm doing all right. Yeah.

44
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:57,560
Did you do any theater productions this weekend? Have you ever been involved with theater?

45
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:00,440
You don't really strike me as the type, but maybe like in high school from like a drama

46
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:05,840
class in high school. No, not really. I had to choose in high school. I could take drama

47
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:11,380
or I could take band and I'm going to be honest, I felt kind of guilted by my parents

48
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:16,480
into doing band because it was like, Oh Rob, your dead grandpa left you this clarinet.

49
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,680
And you know, he would be really proud of you if you would go into band. Oh, you want

50
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,060
to go into drama, but, but you know, your dead grandpa played the clarinet and you know,

51
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:27,300
he died before you were born and you know, you're named after him and this is the one

52
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:34,440
thing he left you and you want to go to drama. Really? So, but, but band nerd represent.

53
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,960
Well I don't, I, and I don't regret my time in band at all. It was a great, like, I'm

54
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:45,400
not like, I'm not like shady, but I, if I was left to the choice, it's not what I would

55
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:49,340
have picked, but I don't regret it at all. The only thing that's kind of sad about it

56
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:55,080
is that since I graduated high school, I have not touched the clarinet at all. I have not

57
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:58,800
played the clarinet since the day I was 18 and graduated high school. I told you what

58
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,820
happened to my saxophone, didn't I? It was in, I, when I moved out here, I had to leave

59
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:06,900
it behind. So I loaned it to my friend who is a music major, so she could take the saxophone

60
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:11,060
class and cause I played saxophone, I played contour alto clarinet, I played alto clarinet,

61
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:18,140
I played damn near everything that was saxophone or clarinet. And, um, she, uh, left it when

62
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:21,900
she moved to Germany, she left it in her mother's attic in D'Iberville, Mississippi. And then

63
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:27,220
this hurricane named Katrina came in and stole her roof and my saxophone. Oh, not good. The

64
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:31,100
end. Not good. Hey, how about that? Loki was trying to talk about his life when we made

65
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:37,540
it about us. How representative of Orange Laundry. The only way I'd ever want to learn

66
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:42,180
or, you know, learn to play the saxophone is just, and really only just a small part

67
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:47,820
would be just to learn how to play the chord for Epic Sax Man and just do that. Cause that's

68
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:54,180
all you really need to know anyways. So that's it. I did, by the way, find a video clip on

69
00:05:54,180 --> 00:06:00,860
Tumblr of a guy going in shirtless on a skateboard playing careless whisper on a saxophone.

70
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:05,540
Nice. All right. Going to our chat room because you know, we do tape live every Sunday night

71
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:10,740
at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern at the voice of geeks network of vog network.com.

72
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:15,180
We are live right after the Bobby black Wolf show and we love interacting with our listeners.

73
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:20,460
We do call it the show where every gamer has a voice and a reginator using his voice to

74
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:25,200
poke fun a little bit saying, but sky, did you go to band camp and tell stories that

75
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:34,320
began with this one time at band camp? Okay. So I mean, that movie really just like worked

76
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:38,800
that line to death, but band camp is a real thing for those of you that didn't do like

77
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:44,320
we, I don't know if you're not like that, but no. Well, okay. No, no, no, no, no. Okay.

78
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:48,480
We didn't have a camp. Yeah. We didn't like go off into the woods or anything. It was

79
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:53,680
go to school for eight hours a day. So you can get a jump on learning your field show

80
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:59,040
music and, and, and for me in Alabama, it's March in the humid with mosquitoes and lose

81
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:02,880
your shoes in the swamp that we had to practice in. Okay. But I will say this, we would stay

82
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,080
overnight. One of the nights, like it would usually be like a Friday, Saturday, Sunday,

83
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:10,080
and we would stay overnight at the school on a Saturday and sleep in the gymnasium because we

84
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,640
were supposed to be learning about what it's like when the band goes out on tour. Mind you,

85
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:19,920
we did the overnight thing on tour once my junior year and we stayed in a motel six or whatever the

86
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:24,720
Canadian version of motel six is some, you know, maple room six. No, I'm kidding. I don't know

87
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,520
what it was called up. There was some discount chain in Canada is where we stayed. Right.

88
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:34,080
Well, okay. But here's the thing, like a band camp, you put a bunch of like horny ass teenagers

89
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:39,440
in high school together in a group and have them staying overnight. Yes. Some dumb things,

90
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,120
dumb stupid teenager things are going to happen. And yes, there were games for all camp.

91
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:50,560
Yeah. I mean, exactly. That's not unique to band. It's any mixed gender camp or really same gender

92
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:56,720
camp too. So I have to tell you now, this is my, my funny band camp story that I told Becky the

93
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:02,240
other day is that there's this one girl who was a clarinet player. I played saxophone and our

94
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,480
sections would meet up at certain points in the show where I would hear bits and pieces of her

95
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:12,320
wanting to come up with a chicken restaurant geared toward women called peckers. Okay. So

96
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:16,080
clearly here we go stealing the show again, dark soccer and I big old band nerds. What kind of kid

97
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:21,680
were you in high school? Logie in high school. Yeah. I do pretty much the same stuff in high

98
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:28,000
school. I do now. I seriously like have a wife and kid. Yeah. I mean, let's see in high school.

99
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,440
I, well, I took art all four years in high school and then one year I took drama as well. Um,

100
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:39,600
but let's see my art class. Like at one point I actually had a free period. So I ended up going

101
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:44,080
into my art class and landing the PCs together and playing games on that. Of course it was red

102
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:52,560
alert or Duke Nukem 3D. And then, um, I used to bring my PlayStation one to, uh, that was actually,

103
00:08:52,560 --> 00:09:00,400
I think I got my PlayStation one 97. Oh my God. I feel old. And so, um, yeah, I'd used to bring

104
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:07,280
that to school and you play during lunch and I still do that now. I bring my systems to work and

105
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:11,920
I play during the night. I was a big nerd in high school, high school too. Actually, this is junior

106
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:17,760
high. I distinctly remember going into, I think it was Mr. Abe was his name. He was the science

107
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:22,960
teacher. I don't know if he's out there in the world still, but he was a, um, a science teacher

108
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:28,080
at, um, Ike junior high school where I went to junior high and we used to go into the classroom

109
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:34,400
and play tank wars. V was a tank wars. VGA was the full name of it. I think there was scorched

110
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:40,720
earth. It was after that, but tank wars, I mean, and it was me and some buddies that I'm still in

111
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,960
touch with his day. We used to play those tank shooting games to death, but you know what's funny?

112
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:49,280
I don't really care for worms now, which is kind of like, like worms is kind of like taking a bite

113
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:54,000
out of that same genre, like scorched earth and all that. But like for me, nothing will ever match

114
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,560
like the mega nuke in scorched earth. Like that was always fun to watch when your friends fire

115
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:03,360
that thing off and swallow up like seven tanks hole. See, you're like, you know, I think you

116
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,840
and I would have been buds. My senior year of high school, we had someone bring one of those,

117
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:14,800
um, generator powered TVs and a super Nintendo because that's what was new at the time was super

118
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:22,720
Nintendo. And okay, grandma, tell us more. But it was when I moved into the dorm, cause I was the

119
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:28,240
only one in our block that had a TV in the, in the dorm room that, uh, uh, my roommate's boyfriend

120
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:33,600
left his PlayStation over. We played a lot of to Shinden and my room was very popular. Yeah.

121
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:38,480
And um, we also watched a lot of sailor moon in college. I had a super Nintendo with super Mario

122
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:44,160
cart and it's the only reason most of those kids wanted to talk to me. So I also had like

123
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:50,160
VHS copies of like the entire run of Ronan warriors on VHS because I stayed up to tape

124
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:56,240
them every day. Nice. So my, my room was like anime central and I had all of a, like I had

125
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:01,120
Ron the project fan subs. That's awesome. And I had an unsubbed copy of the Rotsky doji.

126
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:07,680
So we would make up our own, um, no, we would make up our own dialogue to it.

127
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:11,200
I love hearing about what a colossal nerd you were and still are

128
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,880
dark saga, but we have to keep the show moving because we do have an interview coming up in

129
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:19,040
like 10 minutes. Uh, I do want to teach tonight. We do have an interview live here on orange launch

130
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:24,640
radio. Uh, the interview is with Mike Kennedy. He is a, he's with the website game gavel.com,

131
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,400
which is kind of like an eBay for video games. Pretty cool little thing. Uh, but what he's

132
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:33,520
really here to talk about tonight is the Kickstarter for retro, which is a throwback

133
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:37,840
video game magazine. That's going to be independently published and they're getting a lot of

134
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:42,480
just names out there in the industry to kind of freelance for this. So, uh, excited to type to

135
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,880
talk to Mike about that project. And that'll be in about 10 minutes here live. If you do want to join

136
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:52,000
us in our chat room, live at dot vog network.com is the place to be, uh, before I get into gaming

137
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,360
weeks, I had another kickoff topic I wanted to talk about quickly. Um, I wanted to talk about

138
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:02,480
loaning games out and experiences that you guys have had with loaning out games and loaning out

139
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,960
systems and maybe the good or the bad experience, because I have a really funny story. Uh, the

140
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:11,440
listeners may not be aware of this, but, uh, somebody from orange launch radios past for the

141
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,760
first few years of the show, you might remember a gal who used to come on the show an awful lot

142
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:21,280
named rice princess. And I even back when orange laundry was a station way back in the day on life

143
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:26,640
365, uh, I co-hosted a show with her called outside the box. And, uh, now she just goes by

144
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:32,320
princess Irene, I believe is like her new preferred handle. Uh, princess Irene got married on Thursday

145
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:38,480
and her and silent Nathan, another name from the past, they got married. Uh, finally this past,

146
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:43,200
I say finally, but yeah, uh, this past week. So congratulations and our well wishes to them. And

147
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,480
I'm sure many of the listeners, uh, especially the old school ones. And they hear those names

148
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,800
will be excited to hear that the guy hitched. Well, guess what? Princess Irene went on a

149
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:56,080
honeymoon to Japan. Perfect nerd honeymoon with her new husband, right? Man. I'm jealous. I know,

150
00:12:56,080 --> 00:13:00,800
right. I'm kind of jealous too. So they went to Japan and, uh, she actually asked me, she said,

151
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:05,600
Hey Rob, remember a long time ago, you said I could borrow your 3DS to play animal crossing

152
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,680
at some point. She's like, would it be possible to do that now? Because I got a 12 hour flight

153
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:14,640
to Japan and that would be a great way to pass the time. And I said, Oh, sure. So, uh, she came

154
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:18,800
over Wednesday night. We caught up a little bit. I gave her my 3DS and on she went well,

155
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:25,200
by the time she got married and was on her way out the door, I realized, Oh crap, Pokemon X and Y is

156
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:31,520
on Saturday. And I just loaned my 3DS to my friend. Is this your excuse to get an XL? Well,

157
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:35,200
if your name was Shane and I don't know if he's out there listening,

158
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,520
Shane, the salesman is currently trying to convince me that the best life choice for me

159
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:46,800
would be to buy a Pokemon branded 3DS XL or 2DS. He actually said, yeah, 2DS would be a good idea

160
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:52,880
too. And I'm like, Shane, that's money. That's like 180 bucks. If we were talking like 20 bucks,

161
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:58,160
maybe, but that's like a whole nother system. So I'm currently having to sit and wait and I'm

162
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:03,600
missing the Pokemon boat because I loaned out my 3DS. Now, look, I don't regret it because Irene,

163
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,680
obviously love her to bits. And I, if I can bring a little more entertainment,

164
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,200
tame it to her honeymoon, then, then so be it. But it's just kind of one of those things where

165
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:17,280
I was like, don't that's too bad, but you know what? You can turn this upside or turn this back

166
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:24,800
around because the grand theft auto five ship has made port and guess what? It's available right now

167
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:31,440
for you to go get and play. So, so salesman Loki is going to counter salesman Shane by saying, Hey,

168
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:36,800
do you know for a third of the price of the 3DS, you could be playing grand theft auto five in the

169
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:43,120
vog club right now, right? What you could go the free route and play borderlands two with me play

170
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:49,840
the games I already have, right? Yeah. How about being frugal? Let's hear it for fiscal responsibility.

171
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,440
All right. Go into our chat room for some comments at live.vognetwork.com.

172
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:01,040
Bobby Black Wolf says Irene deserves your 3DS more than you deserve Pokemon. Hey, shut up.

173
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:06,080
Alpha Kinanagram says sky. Maybe she'll get you some Japanese street passes.

174
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:09,840
I actually told her because if there weren't chargers on the plane, I told her to turn the

175
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:15,440
wifi off. So that way, uh, she would save battery power would probably be the smart thing to do.

176
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:20,320
Do they even have the same plugs in Japan that we have here? So she's going to be in for a rude

177
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:26,640
awakening when she gets off the plane. Um, two prong. Yes. Oh really? Okay. Yeah. Two prongs

178
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:32,320
will work. They just don't have the grounded. Oh yeah. Well, okay. We have Japanese PlayStation

179
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:36,240
twos, Rob. Oh, that's true. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I don't have a Japanese dreamcast.

180
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:42,240
If you haven't learned in the past 11 and a half years, sometimes things come out of my mouth

181
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:47,760
before I really think them through dark soccer. The one who had to have the, uh, the, uh, mod,

182
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:54,400
the little, uh, um, plug mod was Jessica because of her APS too.

183
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:58,720
Oh, okay. I had the different plug on it. Gotcha. Bobby, I would totally have played

184
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:03,760
Borderlands two with you. I have had my character ready to go for the longest time and no one's been

185
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:07,920
playing. Well, I was going to say, uh, in the chat room at live.vog network.com, there's several

186
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:11,760
people. Black Wolf is saying, play Borderlands two with me, play Borderlands two with me,

187
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:17,680
dark soccer and Loki. Uh, game grew says, meanwhile, Irene is playing Pokemon in Japan.

188
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:21,440
Uh, no, she's playing animal crossing. I know that, uh, dungeon buster says I'll play Borderlands

189
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:26,640
two with you. So, uh, it looks like you might've started, uh, a Borderlands two game night in our

190
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:31,600
chat room, dark soccer, a way to go. So I'm curious, do you guys have any nightmare stories

191
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:36,000
or maybe good stories about loaning things out? Uh, dark soccer, you guys have the game vault.

192
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,920
Surely you guys loan stuff out all the time. Well, I, for some reason I can't find my first

193
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:43,360
bus to move soundtrack and I hope I didn't lend that out. Cause I don't think I would have loaned

194
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:48,160
that out. Um, I don't know. Usually it works the other way around. People loan me stuff and then

195
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:53,680
they move or I move. Or you keep their stuff forever. Like my dance pad that you had for

196
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:58,240
like a year. It's fine. If I really missed it, I would ask for it back. Well, it's like,

197
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:03,920
it's how I got my copy of Corona trigger. My friend loaned it to me. He moved to a Spanish

198
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:09,040
Fort and then I moved to California. Oops. He hasn't asked for it back. So it's fine.

199
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:13,840
Didn't you save file is still on there. Didn't you get your Saturn copy of symphony of the night

200
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:18,240
through some type of game trade? No, I thought that we bought that shit. I thought it was

201
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,280
something with like a friend of yours owed you money. And that was what she gave you.

202
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:28,160
That was Dracula X. Oh, that was close. Close. My friend Krista who lives in Nagoya.

203
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:33,280
She loves her now, but she used to live in Berkeley. We went to anime expo. She

204
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:37,280
owed us a hundred bucks for her part of the room in the trip. Oh, okay. It was an exchange. She

205
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:43,440
went to Japan to go visit her family. Came back with Dracula X for us. She already had two copies.

206
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:47,920
Got it. Okay. I thought that was like a loaning story. Okay. But that was the exchange for

207
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:52,480
convention space. I gotcha. Trade for goods. Oh, I loan out my games all the time and I forget

208
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:57,040
people forget. I loan people stuff. So right now I don't think I have anything loaned out, but

209
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:02,000
I could very well. Oh, what? Okay. Oh, I have another hilarious loaning, somebody,

210
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,640
a game story. Okay. So, uh, Flaco Jones, I think it was, and I'm sorry if I'm calling you out and

211
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:11,680
it wasn't really you. I loaned him a copy of silent Hill for the room on X-Box. At least I

212
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:17,680
think it was him. And it got passed back to what I knew you had it for forever. I had it for a while.

213
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:21,680
And then I loaned it to, I think it was flog. It might've been extra for though. It was one

214
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:26,880
of them. And they gave it back to Irene because they were like, well, Irene's going to see you

215
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:32,560
next before I do. And so funny enough, when's the next time I see Irene when we're all at a party

216
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:37,840
and then. They give me the game back and I'm like, yay, here's my game back. I can go take

217
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:42,160
this home and not play it. Cause like my original X-Box is like in storage at this point. I don't

218
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:46,160
even, I mean, I guess it's backwards compatible on three 60, but let's be real. I don't have

219
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:50,480
like an anchoring to play silent Hill for the room anytime soon. So what did I do guys?

220
00:18:51,360 --> 00:19:00,160
I left the game at the party. I didn't even bring it home. I'm pretty sure that game has been sold

221
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:04,320
by this point. So it's just funny. You can borrow mine. If everyone play it

222
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,960
now that I actually have it. I don't really like, like if I was going to go back and play

223
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:14,240
a silent Hill game, I think I'd go play two or three. I loaned actually my three to my friend

224
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:20,480
Carly. You remember you met Carly, haven't you? The one who says the best rendition of the sea

225
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:27,760
bomb ever. Oh my, she makes it sound like it's poetry, but, um, at any rate, she had my silent

226
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:34,000
Hill three for a long time. And I think I have it back. I don't know. Yeah. Usually it's people

227
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,520
that I will, Julie has borrowed stuff of mine and never given it back. And then she'll say,

228
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,720
Oh, that was mine. I bought that. No, that was not yours. Here's the receipt.

229
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,400
I like that. You're calling people out here on the show. She's not listening though. Right?

230
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,560
No, she's not listening. She's too busy playing fantasy star universe,

231
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:54,240
which I think she's like the one person who's probably playing PSO too now. Oh yeah. Oh,

232
00:19:54,240 --> 00:20:00,240
everybody's moved on. That's right. I need to start playing again. Sounds good. All right.

233
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:04,240
Let's go ahead and move into our gaming weeks, at least here for just a little bit. We'll talk

234
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,920
about our gaming weeks. So we are going to get interrupted though, by the live interview here

235
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:12,400
with Mike from the retro magazine Kickstarter here in just a minute, but we'll start with our

236
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,640
gaming week. So at least get dark soccer. Okay. Well, um, I played mass effect three

237
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:21,360
because Tara started playing mass effect and I was like, Oh, mass effect. So I started playing

238
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:27,920
and spent more time screen capping than playing the game. And then, um, I, uh, I played animal

239
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:32,240
crossing. I played a lot of animal crossing cause I'm trying to get my tan back and, um,

240
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:37,520
I played fractal and I played final fantasy 14, which I want us to play at the same time.

241
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:45,520
Second run dungeons. And then, um, uh, a lot, a lot of, um, be jeweled on my phone,

242
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:51,600
on your phone, the blitz version where you try to do it. I play the stupid butterfly mode and

243
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:56,320
diamond mine mode because I don't, I'm so out of the loop. It's actually really cool. Cause it

244
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:01,120
requires a real strategy. When you play, it's basically your, your butterflies have different

245
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:05,280
colors and you have to line them up. But every time you line up something else, the butterflies

246
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:09,200
move up a level and there's a spider at the top waiting to pick them up. So you have to keep all

247
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,280
these butterflies from reaching the top and at the same time making your lines and doing them.

248
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:18,720
So you have no time limit, but you have to think carefully. Okay. All right. Uh, is that it for

249
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:23,120
your gaming week? Yes. All right. Well, before we get to Loki's gaming week, we're going to cut in

250
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:28,960
here cause it's about that time. Uh, we are going to go to the phones right now and talk to Mike

251
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:36,720
Kennedy. He is with retro, which is a Kickstarter that's going on right now for a throwback video

252
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:42,160
game magazine as in like a print magazine. And uh, let's see if we get him on the line. Hi Mike,

253
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:46,480
you there? I'm here. How's it going? Good. Welcome to orange launch radio. How are you?

254
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:51,120
I'm doing great. Thanks for having me on. No problem whatsoever. So tell us a little bit

255
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:54,880
about your Kickstarter. You're behind this Kickstarter for a new magazine retro, right?

256
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:59,520
Yeah. Yeah. This is something that, uh, has come about pretty quick. Um, I've actually had

257
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:04,640
the idea of adding content to a gaming auction site that I've run called game gavel for about,

258
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:09,600
I don't know, maybe two years now. And, uh, we originally, uh, we're bringing on some writers

259
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:14,400
and we were doing, you know, just online content, uh, kind of, uh, kind of an editorial side of the

260
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:18,000
website. And then one of my writers said, Mike, have you ever thought about doing a,

261
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,520
a digital magazine? And I thought, well, hell no, I've never really thought about doing a

262
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:26,960
digital magazine. Um, only because I'm, I've never, I mean, personally, I don't have digital

263
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:32,080
magazines on my iPad. Um, and I don't know how many people really do. Um, but we're hoping

264
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:36,080
obviously that, that, you know, it's something that people are doing more and more of. Um,

265
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:40,160
but then I got the idea after hooking up with another guy, uh, Mark Kaminsky,

266
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:44,160
who's our layout and design guy. Uh, he said, let's go for it. Let's just, you know, let's just,

267
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:49,760
let's do a boat. Let's do a print and digital. And, uh, this was maybe two and a half weeks ago,

268
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:55,920
maybe three, three weeks ago, tops. And since he's come on board, um, you know, he works for

269
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:59,840
just this really large media company and, and, uh, he does, uh, you know, magazine layout and

270
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:05,440
design for tons of other magazines. And he basically, uh, wanted to, um, contribute to

271
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:11,360
the project and, uh, you know, just basically came on board and has just really, um, uh, I just have

272
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:15,200
to say kicked ass because I mean, he does, he designed that video for us that we're using on

273
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:20,880
the Kickstarter page. Uh, you know, he designed a kind of a preview layout of the magazine and

274
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:26,000
he's just kind of done this all really, really fast. So he was sort of the missing link in,

275
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,800
in the idea of doing, uh, whether it was a digital or print magazine. So, um, so sorry,

276
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:35,600
this whole idea is only about three weeks old with the magazine only about three weeks. Yeah.

277
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:40,080
So in a really short amount of time, uh, I guess I can tell everybody a little bit about, uh,

278
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:46,080
the magazine first is, is, um, I've always had this idea of kind of going out and recruiting

279
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:52,640
some of the best writers in the industry and, you know, not only, uh, writers from, you know,

280
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:57,840
maybe the past maybe five to 10 years, but going back and really digging deep into the history of

281
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:02,000
video game journalism and going out and just kind of recruiting, uh, right now we've got over three

282
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:07,600
decades of video game journalists. So no matter, you know, when anybody kind of grew up gaming or

283
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:11,920
what your decade of gaming was, whether it was the late seventies, early to mid eighties,

284
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:16,240
the nineties, or today, you're probably going to recognize some of the contributors that we're

285
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:20,720
going to have on the magazine. So I had to assemble this team really in about a week's time.

286
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:25,200
You know, um, I called Jeremy parish and I get Jeremy, you know, gave me tons and tons of great

287
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:30,160
information about, uh, you know, uh, compensation, you know, in this day and age and, and what you

288
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:35,360
kind of need to pay. Right. And, um, you know, kind of, uh, and I've got quite a few connections

289
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:40,960
in the industry already, uh, just running game gavel for the last six years and kind of living

290
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:45,200
in Southern California, kind of the hotbed of, of developer and publisher activity. I got a lot

291
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:49,520
of friends in the develop, you know, that are developers and, and, uh, publishing executives

292
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:55,200
and stuff like that. So, um, it just sort of, the, the plans just sort of aligned very quickly

293
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:59,680
on this thing. And I wasn't able to assemble, uh, pretty much kind of a who's who of gaming

294
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:03,920
journalists to bring them in on this and, and lo and behold, everybody thought it was a great idea.

295
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:08,560
Um, in fact, a lot of them said that they've all had ideas for doing something like this,

296
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,720
um, but just never, but never done it yet. So it's kind of one of those, like, it almost

297
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:17,520
sounds like it's like a, um, I don't know, like, uh, uh, uh, they bring in everything together,

298
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:23,840
like the Voltron or something of, of this, this, uh, people, uh, these writers. And, um, I, I,

299
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:27,040
that's why I expressed surprise a minute ago is that, wow, this thing's only three weeks old

300
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:30,960
because, you know, you go over to the Kickstarter page and I'm scrolling and scrolling and scrolling

301
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:35,280
and it's, you know, this big list of people. And I'm like, wow, you got, you got your little team

302
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:39,840
America together at well team worldwide really together in like three weeks. That's, that's

303
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:43,520
pretty, I didn't really make it through the bottom of the page because I stopped to look at Sean

304
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:48,640
baby's hair. I was just like, what is going on there? I don't understand this. I don't either.

305
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:52,320
You know, I met him for the first time. We were at the Portland retro gaming expo last weekend

306
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:57,760
and, um, he was up there and we've been talking on the phone a lot and, uh, but yeah, he's basically,

307
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:01,760
that's pretty much it, you know, and I think he'll, uh, sometimes it's that little Mohawk's

308
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:06,560
green and fluorescent green. Sometimes it's orange, pink or red. I'm very jealous of him

309
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:09,840
that it's not falling out because when you dye your hair that much, that's what's supposed to

310
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:13,200
be happening. But anyway, if you guys have a question for Mike, uh, with retro magazine,

311
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:18,880
Kickstarter, you can ask that live here in our chat room, live.vog network.com dark soccer.

312
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:22,480
I know you're dying to say something here because you've been studying print for awhile. This has to

313
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:27,360
be tickling you this whole idea, right? Well, you had me at print. I love the smell of CMYK fumes in

314
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:34,320
the morning. That's right. Um, I actually am a print designer and I, and I actually have just

315
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:42,400
recently gone into contract writing as in writing by contract. Yes I have. So, um, I, I find the

316
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:48,320
whole thing just very fascinating. I was wondering though, um, where you happen to get other, uh,

317
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:52,720
bits of inspiration from, cause I know that in the UK there's retro gamer right now and

318
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:58,160
yep. Yeah, no, that's a great magazine. I mean if, if, you know, if we can put together,

319
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:02,320
you know, something half as good as that, I'd be, you know, I love it. I mean that,

320
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:08,480
the thing that's so great about their magazine is they pack so much into it and they, they throw it

321
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:13,680
all together. Um, and like every spread, every like, you know, two page spread will have like

322
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:18,000
10 different stories going on, but yet they make it work. You know what I mean? And every time you

323
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,680
read that magazine, you see something new. It doesn't matter how many times you pick it up

324
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:24,400
or you know how old the magazine is. I mean you're reading through it and you're like,

325
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:28,640
God, I don't remember reading this, you know, the other 20 times I've flipped through the pages,

326
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:32,960
you know, their design is so clever. So I've, I was thinking, you know, I've thought for a

327
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:37,440
while that we could use something like that, you know, geared toward a North American audience

328
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:41,680
because some of the machines they cover over there, we never got out over here, but are you

329
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:46,400
also planning on including like some of the old import market, you know? Yeah, I tell you what,

330
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:52,560
it's since we've launched the Kickstarter campaign, we have had, uh, some great writers

331
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:57,840
from around the world contact us and want to be a part of this. Um, also in the U S I mean,

332
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:03,200
that's why this list keeps growing. I mean, when I first started out with this, I had,

333
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:10,320
uh, like Jeremy, uh, Sean, uh, cat. Um, you know, we went after Bob Mackie. Uh, of course he, he,

334
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,920
uh, the doors open to him, but he had some other things that, that, that might get in the way you

335
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:18,400
thought. Um, and a few others. So I had like maybe, maybe 10 to 12 people. And I think now

336
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:23,600
we've grown to like over 20 because people just want to be a part of this. And it's almost like,

337
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:28,000
you know, uh, they're not doing it for the money of course, because right now it's so segment,

338
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,840
we have so many people, it's not like in each, any one of them is going to be, you know, submitting

339
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:35,840
so many things. A lot of these people are going to be submitting, you know, maybe one or two columns,

340
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:40,480
um, that are recurring. Um, while we have others that might do, you know, a feature article,

341
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:44,160
an interview if we want them to do that, you know, or some assignment type, some assignment

342
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:48,960
type work. But, but yeah, the, to, to answer the question, we've had, uh, a couple of folks in

343
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:54,240
Japan, uh, send me some of their work and their journalists and podcasters over there. Uh, we've

344
00:28:54,240 --> 00:29:00,000
had, uh, someone in the UK, we had somebody in Germany and, um, the deal is, I mean, I'm,

345
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:05,200
I'm basically, um, we'd love to have import information in here, whether it's current gen or,

346
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:09,120
you know, retro and classic information, because I mean, those areas had huge, you know, huge

347
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:14,320
influences, uh, even on the gaming here in the United States. Um, and it's sort of like,

348
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:17,920
you know, I mean, uh, I don't know what your first introduction was kind of to Japanese gaming,

349
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:22,480
but like the turbo graphics for me when I was little was sort of that strange, you know,

350
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:28,240
kind of mystical game, you know, console that, you know, played Japanese games. And, um, you know,

351
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:32,640
and then I guess the Neo Geo kind of came in and, you know, uh, I guess maybe right after that,

352
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:36,160
or pretty cool, pretty damn near about the same time, I guess. But, you know, it was always just

353
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:40,560
weird and seeing these games, um, you know, it was, it was just totally, you know, mind blowing

354
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:43,680
to see what they were doing over there. So there's some great history there and we really want to

355
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:47,600
cover all of the bases in retro. I mean, uh, you know, all the bases. So that personally makes me

356
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:51,600
happy. I guess you could, uh, could, uh, imagine my, uh, delight when I married someone who had

357
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:58,000
a turbo duo and a Neo Geo. Oh yeah. Um, I always like to ask this question of, uh, Kickstarter folks

358
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,800
when they come on the show, uh, you have this Kickstarter behind the campaign. I think it's

359
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:06,080
kind of obvious that, you know, the money is probably being raised because you actually have

360
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:10,400
to print the magazine that doesn't come for free, but what is it you're specifically raising the

361
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:14,960
money to do in this process? Well, mainly actually paying the writers, you know, these guys don't

362
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:22,160
come cheap and, uh, you know, my original budget was, uh, about six grand per issue, you know,

363
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:27,040
and if we got six issues, there's 36 grand right there. Right. Right. Um, and then of course we do

364
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:31,120
have printing costs now, Mark being in the industry, you know, uh, Mark commits my layout

365
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:35,440
and design guy, he's got some great contacts and we've really got our printing costs, uh,

366
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:39,920
in check. I mean, we've got them way low, even if we could even get up to, and this is sort of

367
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:45,200
maybe a lofty goal right now, but over 10,000, a total of 10,000 per issues, it drops down to

368
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:51,520
about, uh, about 90 cents an issue or a print. And that's, uh, you know, 50 right now we're,

369
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:55,680
we're, we're going to, it's going to be a minimum of 52 pages, a high gloss page, and we're gonna

370
00:30:55,680 --> 00:31:00,240
do a thick stock cover. Do you guys remember like a next generation magazine? Yeah. Yeah. I mean,

371
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:04,720
one of the last greatest magazines, uh, at least as far as I'm concerned, you know, and they always

372
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:08,800
had that thick cover and I've still got, you know, I think the first two years, uh, even at their

373
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:13,520
premiere issue, uh, up, up in my closet because I just can't throw them away. They're just too nice

374
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:17,200
and they're a resource. You know, they had lots of, uh, you know, it was kind of that first

375
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:21,200
magazine that was kind of geared more towards, uh, I'm not gonna say adults, but I mean,

376
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:25,920
older gamers kind of at the time. And it's just full of great information. The covers were so

377
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:29,840
high quality is like, it wasn't a magazine you just read and throw in the trash. I don't think.

378
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:34,160
And that's what we want to do. We want to do, you know, uh, kind of a thick stock cover. Um,

379
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:39,360
you know, and, uh, just, just something that's going to kind of be a resource and, uh, Mark,

380
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:42,560
you know, being the great guy is, you know, we're, we're, we put an update in there about,

381
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:46,480
you know, using environmentally conscious, you know, materials and everything, soy inks and,

382
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:50,560
and recyclable paper. But the thing is going to look beautiful. Um, but I mean,

383
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:55,360
those are all things that we're thinking about. Um, and, you know, thanks to Mark, you know,

384
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:59,760
for kind of coming on and being in the industry and kind of knowing where to go, uh, and, and

385
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:03,200
putting this whole thing together. He, the magazine is going to look as good as anything

386
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:06,160
you've ever seen. I can guarantee you that with him on board this thing. Well, I think there's

387
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:09,680
a lot of people out there that definitely kind of collected these sort of game magazines and

388
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:14,640
are probably really looking for something like this. Um, I know that, uh, part of the approach,

389
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:18,160
at least that I was getting from the Kickstarter page is that you don't necessarily want these

390
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:22,560
issues to feel dated. I know the Kickstarter page says, you're not really looking at covering the

391
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:27,440
current in gaming. Just because you call it retro doesn't mean it's retro only, but I'm getting the

392
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:32,800
sense that you want these magazines to have to not be dated or, or stuck to a certain month and year,

393
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:36,560
right? Yeah. Well, for sure. I mean, every magazine is going to cover everything. It's

394
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:41,520
going to be heavily weighted with retro, of course. Um, certainly any current generation games or, or,

395
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:46,160
or gaming, you know, topics that have some sort of a historical background or relevance, uh, we want

396
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:50,000
to talk about, um, you know, we're kind of going back and forth. That's not to say we won't, you

397
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:55,440
know, uh, review AAA titles, but I mean, what's the point of reviewing, you know, Call of Duty 12

398
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:59,040
of if every other magazine and every other website's already doing it, you know what I mean?

399
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:04,480
And so, you know, like I said, you may or may not see those types of, those types of things, you

400
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:08,000
know, uh, reviewed, you know, typically we're going to hopefully look for stuff that kind of

401
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,240
flies under the radar. Certainly the indie stuff is big right now and there's tons of innovation

402
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:17,680
there, even, you know, on the retro side and mobile, you know? Um, so you can expect console,

403
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:22,400
mobile, indie, uh, PC gaming, arcade and pinball. We got Kevin Steele in there from

404
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:27,120
Game Room Magazine going to bring up that end of it. Um, you know, we're going to cover it all,

405
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:31,200
you know, we're going to try to fit it into 52 pages. I'm thinking there's probably a

406
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:35,360
relatively good chance that this thing's going to increase to 60 pages, uh, when we start.

407
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:38,240
Well, that's one of your stretch goals, right? Is to try and thicken the magazine?

408
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:41,520
Yeah, yeah. We didn't really, that's one of the things we've been a little bit criticized over

409
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:45,680
kind of the, kind of the ambiguity behind the stretch goals. And right now, um, you know,

410
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:49,920
we don't really know, we know it's going to be a minimum of 52 pages and only four pages of ads.

411
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:54,240
So we want to keep it, you know, uh, lots of, you know, lots of in-depth features and stuff and

412
00:33:54,240 --> 00:34:00,160
minimal on the ad space. Um, but you know, right now we've got so many people, uh, the, the trick

413
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:04,400
for us is going to be, you know, how do we juggle everybody? Is everybody in every issue? Uh, are

414
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:08,880
some people staggered, you know, every other issue, um, or do we just simply add more pages? And

415
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:13,120
honestly, that's what we'd want to do. Um, and I think we get up, you know, if we can get up over,

416
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:17,600
you know, to the sixties, you know, uh, our goal is 50,000, which really is what we've budgeted

417
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:23,840
as sort of a breakeven point to produce six 52 page issues. So if we can go, um, you know,

418
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:27,520
if we can get up to 60, 70,000, we'd like to add, you know, another four pages, you know,

419
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:32,000
four page increments, of course. Um, we get up to 60 pages and, and, uh, you know, maybe you get

420
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:37,440
into the 80 to 90 page range maybe before the year is over. Um, we've, we've got, I mean, we're,

421
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:42,240
there will be no shortage of content. I'll tell you that, um, these guys are already, you know,

422
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:46,080
coming up with some great ideas, uh, things they're going to be writing about. And I'm just

423
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:50,240
as excited as everybody else, uh, to be reading what all these people have to say. You're just

424
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:54,560
putting this all together. You can't wait to read it yourself. I can't. Yeah, I really can't. I've

425
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:58,400
been reading, you know, I mean, I grew up gaming in the seventies and, and, you know, electronic

426
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:03,440
games, the first kind of magazine dedicated to the hobby, um, you know, back in the early eighties,

427
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:10,480
um, and, um, you know, graduated into, you know, game fan and EGM and, and, uh, game pro like

428
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:14,240
everybody else did. You remember when game magazines used to be like 200 pages thick.

429
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:17,760
I do. You know, I mean, those, those were the days. I mean, those were just great days.

430
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:23,120
I also, I was really fond of, um, my first gaming system and I'm using my quotey fingers was really

431
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:27,440
a Commodore 64. So I remember, I remember the magazines that were like the really nice glossy

432
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:31,520
pages at the beginning and the back was more like newspaper. Cause it was all the type these into

433
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:35,440
your computer. Yeah. Right. Get these games type of thing. Yeah. I've got a Commodore 64 set up

434
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:40,560
here in the home arcade. Yeah. I mean, it's, you know, I collect, you know, that's part of the

435
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:44,560
reason I started game gavel, the auction site back in away, which is to give gamers a better place to

436
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:48,240
buy and sell. It's a lot cheaper than eBay, free listings, free seller stores. We've got tons of

437
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:53,040
great sellers on there. Um, and, uh, the plan. Um, and, and we're not going to bombard people

438
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:56,800
with game gavel in the magazine, but on the digital side, uh, well, first of all, if everybody

439
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:00,160
that buys the print subscription is going to get digital for free. Okay. So you're going to be able

440
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:05,920
to kind of get both. Um, the digital magazines, we will have, uh, maybe just a shopping cart icon.

441
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:09,120
So if you're reading about a game, you know, we'll put a shopping cart on there. If you click

442
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:12,960
the shopping cart, it'll pull up the listings and the auction site for all of the other gamers that

443
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:17,360
are, that are, that are selling that game, you know, and bringing people into the marketplace

444
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:22,080
to buy and sell. So that's kind of the plan, kind of integrating the commerce with the content,

445
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:25,440
at least with the digital. I was gonna say a little bit of synergy between your, your different

446
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:29,120
projects, but that's smart. I mean, there's nothing wrong with that. Uh, if you guys want

447
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:33,520
to consider donating to a retro, the throwback video game magazine, you can find that on

448
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:38,480
Kickstarter. It's a kickstarter.com slash projects slash. So Cal Mike, but it's probably easier to

449
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:43,760
just go to kickstarter.com and search for retro. Uh, some of the different various award tiers,

450
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:48,880
you can actually get, uh, for $7, the premiere issue of retro. If you want to look at a six

451
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:55,920
years, uh, one or six issue, excuse me, one year digital subscription, uh, you can kick back $12

452
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,520
for that, uh, dark soccer, very reasonable. Yeah. You had something dark soccer. Well,

453
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:06,480
you said you said the magic P word pinball. Yeah. So, um, that actually really, uh,

454
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:10,400
my husband and I collect pinball tables. Oh, right. And, um, we're down to three,

455
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:15,200
but we have a twilight zone. So that's what matters. What else do you guys have? Um,

456
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:20,800
we have world cup soccer 94, which was my favorite and, uh, jackpot. Oh, right. Yeah.

457
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:26,560
We actually got rid of no fear for jackpot, but, um, it was like, I know we actually have

458
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:31,280
hung out a few times with, uh, Steve Ritchie. Um, yeah, we know Steve. He's such a great guy.

459
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:36,800
Oh yeah. Uh, and he does the voices. That's so amazing. But, um, I was asking what I was

460
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:40,640
wondering about the pinball is if you were going to be, um, like doing interviews with stern and,

461
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:45,440
and covering some of the newer, uh, yeah. I mean, I, I mean, I know the stern, I noticed,

462
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:49,520
um, you know, we know stern real well. We know Jersey Jack real well. Um, you know,

463
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:52,960
they just came out with wizard of Oz and they're working, I think on their second table now.

464
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:56,640
Um, so yeah, I mean, anytime there's a new table out, we want to do, you know,

465
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:00,400
an in-depth review of that thing and, and, uh, you know, interview the designers behind it.

466
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:04,080
Uh, we just, uh, we've got great, you know, again, I've just got some great, uh,

467
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:09,200
great contacts going back, uh, um, you know, through, through the years and everything. And,

468
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:14,240
and, uh, we do, um, retro gaming round up podcast for about six years and every one of those shows,

469
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:19,200
we do a one to two hour interview with somebody, um, you know, famous, some old gaming, you know,

470
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:24,560
we did Al Alcorn and Ted Dabney, all the Activision guys, uh, Steve, I mean, uh,

471
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:28,880
some of the pinball folks. I mean, it, it goes on and on and on. We get all of our interviews

472
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:32,720
at classic gaming expo and Portland and the Portland show. We just went to, we got some

473
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:36,960
great interviews up there. Um, and a lot of those interviews can be transcribed into the

474
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:41,280
magazine as well. Just kind of preserved in print. Nice. Let me go to, let me go to chat

475
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:45,680
room with a couple of questions, uh, from live.vognetwork.com. Uh, I'll ask a couple

476
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:49,920
of these questions and then we'll wrap up here. Um, dark Tetsuya in our chat room says, uh,

477
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:54,800
out of all the names you got involved, who were you the most excited to get on board?

478
00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:00,400
Um, boy, I would have to say, if I could answer too, well, I don't know. I'd have to say Jeremy

479
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:05,840
parish because, you know, Jeremy is, is such a consummate professional. He's just, he's a great

480
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:10,160
writer. Um, and people love Jeremy, you know, there's just something about him that, that

481
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:16,240
everybody loves. Um, uh, I hate to, you know, single anybody out. I mean, Sean baby, Chris

482
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:22,000
Kohler, Jeff green, uh, Andy Eddie, for God's sakes. Um, cat Bailey, Ryan Scott, Leonard Herman,

483
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:26,880
a big historian in, in the, uh, in the, um, you know, in the industry that writes just these great

484
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:30,560
books, you know, and, uh, what I'm excited about having Lenny on board is, is, you know, he, he

485
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:35,840
writes some of them. Are you familiar with, with Lenny Herman? Uh, the name doesn't ring a bell,

486
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:38,240
but it's probably one of those things when you tell me what he did. I'll be like, yes,

487
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:41,840
Leonard Herman and look at the books. I mean, he writes just some of the best books on the history

488
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:46,080
of gaming. And, uh, these are like, you know, five, 600 pages is a lot of times they're,

489
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:49,280
they're insane. And so what I'm excited about is, is there's a lot of young general, you know,

490
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:53,360
kind of the younger generation gamer who may not pick up, you know, a 500 page book on the industry

491
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:58,000
and the history of it. Um, but you know, if he can write, you know, four or five, six pages on a,

492
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,640
on a particular topic, um, you know, I think, I think kids will read it and, and really learn

493
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:06,000
something about the industry. And that's what we really want to do. We want to sort of preserve the

494
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,920
past and kind of look back and understand, you know, why the industry is what it is. I mean,

495
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:13,200
God, when it started, everybody thought it was gonna be a fad. I remember back in the

496
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:17,200
seventies and the eighties, you know, nobody knew it was going to be around for another 30 years.

497
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:20,640
I really love reading the stories from like the time when people were developing for the

498
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:24,400
Atari 2600, when it just sounded like, you know, it was so much pressure and it was like one or

499
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:28,480
two people. And it's such a different type of culture than what we see now. We had two days

500
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:33,520
to make Pac-Man. You know, I've, I'm always fascinated by that. And like really how it's

501
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:37,120
grown into these. Now you look at a game like Grand Theft Auto five and it's like, you know,

502
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:41,440
it's like shooting five movies all at the same time. It's so much. Yeah. I mean, it's,

503
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:45,280
it's really insane. It's really insane. But yeah, I'd have to say Jeremy, I was really glad

504
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:49,760
to get him on more, but, but not to just pick anybody. I'm, I'm just loving everybody that

505
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:54,080
we've assembled into this thing so far. And, and a lot of them, you know, have asked to get involved

506
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:58,160
with it after the fact. Nice. You know, which is great, which is sort of, uh, I think just

507
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:02,320
led some credibility to the idea of, of, uh, you know, everybody wants to be a part of this thing

508
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:07,920
and, uh, you know, getting the, getting all of this wisdom and, and history, uh, you know,

509
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:12,800
it packed into the pages of a single magazine, uh, has never been done before. Even on a website,

510
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:16,720
you know, there's not, there's not been a writing team like this assembled. So it's,

511
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:21,680
it's just a special thing. And, um, you know, we, uh, I think we got a long way to go. I mean, we're

512
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:28,800
you know, around 35% of goal right now. Uh, but you know, we got 20 days to go. That sounds like

513
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:32,080
it long time, but the days kind of keep ticking away. And I keep thinking to myself, you know,

514
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:35,200
the trend has kind of been down, but I've talked to people who run kickstarters. I don't know if

515
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:38,880
you guys know anybody or run into yourself, but it sounds like there's a little bit of a kind of

516
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:43,360
a smile or it kind of dips and goes down. And then, you know, people just wait. Cause you know,

517
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:47,040
I wait a lot of times on kickstarters. I'll wait till the last few days or the last week,

518
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:51,440
you know, and then, you know, there's a big kind of a surge of people kind of that last week.

519
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:55,600
And so, uh, yeah, we kind of hope it goes that way. I think the internet is kind of a funky

520
00:41:55,600 --> 00:42:00,080
place too, where you kind of have to just catch that wave at the right moment where it hits and

521
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:03,840
it goes viral and then it's spreading everywhere. And then that's where your kickstarter is really

522
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:09,360
going to take off. So, um, I hope I, I, I'm not going to profess to be a very large organization

523
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:13,840
here at orange launch radio, other voice geeks network, but I hope we can do what we can here

524
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:17,200
by having you on tonight to bring awareness to it. Maybe, maybe cause a little bit of an uptick

525
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:22,800
with that. Um, again, if you guys want to look at a retro, you can check that out at kickstarter.com

526
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:27,200
and I'm also happy to spread the word around the pinball circles. Yeah, please do. I mean,

527
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:31,120
we, we want to definitely have, uh, you know, some pinball, uh, uh, content in every issue,

528
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:34,160
you know? Um, I think there's plenty of plenty of things to talk about.

529
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:39,120
Especially with the craziness of some of the tables that have just come out and are coming

530
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:44,240
out. Metallica was crazy. Have you seen Wizard of Oz? Yes, I did. I played it. Holy crap. That

531
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:48,560
thing was insane. It's crazy. And there's just so much going on. I was like, I'm about to go

532
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:53,760
into overload. I think I need to take a break. Yeah. It's a very impressive table. I like the

533
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:58,240
Tron table. I thought that was cool, but I'm a big nerd. I like the special edition Tron.

534
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:02,480
All right. Before I let Mike go, Mike, we always ask our guests this when they come on the show

535
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:05,760
and it may have nothing to do with the project that you're talking about, but we are a video

536
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:11,120
game show. We want to know what kind of games are you playing this week? Oh my gosh. Well,

537
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:16,640
I just picked up a missile command cocktail table here on the Craigslist here in LA

538
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:23,040
for a whopping $140. Super cheap for a cocktail table. That's great. Oh my gosh. I mean,

539
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:26,640
everybody, I got friends all over the country and you guys are in LA, right? Or Southern

540
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:31,840
California. We're in Sacramento. So we're about six hours north of you. Yeah. I drove up there.

541
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:37,360
I drove to Portland and spent a night on the way up in Sac. But I don't know what it is up north,

542
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:43,040
but down here, it's just sort of like a feeding friends. I mean, my friends are going nuts because

543
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:47,360
I find such great deals like on Craigslist, you know, they're like missile command, 140 bucks.

544
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:52,480
That would have been $500 in Virginia, you know? And so, yeah, I just picked that up

545
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:57,680
and I've been playing some, what was I playing today? I think Gradius 5 on the PS2. Nice.

546
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:03,600
Great game. I've got a little man cave down here, kind of home office where I've got,

547
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:08,560
you know, four arcade games. I got a Touchmaster hooked up. I got an Apple IIc and my Commodore's

548
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:13,920
hooked up. I got about 90 Commodore cartridges and I play that all the time. So you don't just

549
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:19,840
talk the talk with this retro stuff. You walk the walk as well. Yeah, no, man. I'm in deep. Thank

550
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:24,320
God my wife loves to play games as well. So that's how my husband and I got together.

551
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:26,320
A last thing here, Dark Soccer, you had one more thing.

552
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:34,400
I actually was just thinking of imagined if our two vaults combined, it would totally

553
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:39,600
explode the world. Dark Soccer and Her Abbey have a huge gaming vault as well that just like all

554
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:44,240
this stuff. So I want to go play all this stuff now, but you were actually asking about a little

555
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:48,960
bit about what the market is up here. For a lot of the retro games, they're actually quite expensive

556
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:53,680
and it's easy for us to go to the Bay Area too. It's not unreasonable. But especially in the

557
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:58,720
pinball market, for example, our Twilight Zone about maybe five years ago, we could have gotten

558
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:03,920
about three grand for it. We could easily get six. Right. Yeah. Well, that's one of the greats.

559
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:09,120
Yeah. All right. Well, I got to wrap up and let Mike go. Mike, thanks so much for your time here.

560
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:13,120
Thank you guys so much. I really appreciate the opportunity to tell your listeners about this.

561
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:16,960
No worries. And best of luck with the project. You know, one thing I don't think I really got

562
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:20,160
out there during the interview is that we love that you're taking an indie approach to it.

563
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:23,280
We've always been fiercely independent here at Orange Lawn Trader. You know,

564
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:26,880
we've been doing what we do here since 2002. Yeah. Amazing.

565
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:30,400
Yeah. For 11 plus years. Before a podcast even was a podcast.

566
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:35,360
Yes, actually. Yeah. We were a live 365 show for a couple of years before that.

567
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:36,960
Oh, right. We tell all the kids to get off our lawn.

568
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:41,840
But yeah, I mean, we love that you guys are keeping it independent with this. Even if

569
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:46,480
you are bringing in people who are kind of paid behind the big budget stuff,

570
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:50,000
you're kind of at least getting them outside of that element for this indie production.

571
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,680
I think that's fantastic. It's great because they're going to, I think that, I mean,

572
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:57,360
these guys aren't used to writing and kind of this type of environment. I think I mentioned

573
00:45:57,360 --> 00:46:00,640
that one of the updates that, you know, they're used to working for these big media companies

574
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:05,280
all the time. And so, I'm hoping that, you know, they're on a long leash. I'll tell you that. I

575
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:07,760
mean, really, they're not on any kind of a leash. I mean, I don't know what they're going to be

576
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:11,840
writing about. You know, we'll obviously kind of nail some of that down as we move forward

577
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:16,400
to building the first issue. But I really think that they're going to talk about things and write

578
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:19,440
maybe just a little bit differently in this environment than they would normally write,

579
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:23,520
you know, working for Future US or WriteGN or, you know, one of these big companies.

580
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:28,640
So, I'm just really excited to kind of give them the freedom to kind of write what they want to

581
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:34,560
write about, how they want to write. A new side of some of your favorite video game authors.

582
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:40,320
Yeah. Hey, one last thing too. Speaking of Live 365, I also do a retroarcaderadio.com. It's just

583
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:46,320
24 hours a day, live streaming, retro gaming related music and old vintage commercials.

584
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:50,400
You guys are interested in that. It's been going on. I've been running that for about

585
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:56,160
five or six years as well. So, retroarcaderadio.com, but it's a Live 365 station as well.

586
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:01,680
Hey, they served a great purpose for us for many years until we decided to branch out. So,

587
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:05,680
but yeah, that's awesome. That sounds like a great thing to do when you're playing your

588
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:10,560
Commodore 64 with 90 cartridges and all this other crazy stuff you have. So, that's awesome.

589
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:15,280
Well, best of luck with your various projects. That's retroarcaderadio.com?

590
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:16,480
Retroarcaderadio.com.

591
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:20,080
Retroarcaderadio.com. Okay. So, you got retroarcaderadio.com,

592
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:25,600
gamegavel.com and soon retro game magazine or whatever domain you get for this.

593
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:26,000
Yep.

594
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,960
Dot com as well. You're a busy guy, Mike. Best of luck with all your projects.

595
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:29,600
Thank you so much.

596
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:32,240
Thank you for taking the time out to be with us here at OLR tonight. Have a great night.

597
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:33,360
All right. Bye guys.

598
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:36,640
All right. Bye-bye. Wow. That was awesome.

599
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:37,840
You should be our new best friend.

600
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:43,440
You want to be his best friend. No, I liked him. He seemed well enough,

601
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:46,800
but you guys definitely have the retro pinball. That same same's there.

602
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:48,800
Well, just a moment he said pinball is like, bing.

603
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:53,680
Well, you don't get any of that in any of the current publications really,

604
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:58,640
unless it's specifically pinball. And I mean, especially now with, you know,

605
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:03,040
for example, that wizard of Oz table has such a heavy video element with it

606
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:07,760
that, or all the pinball 2000 that had the screens.

607
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:14,640
You're dealing with a pinball and video game, you know, a digital game combined

608
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:17,680
that isn't baby Pac-Man. But I still love baby Pac-Man.

609
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:19,840
I still love baby Pac-Man. I love me some baby Pac-Man.

610
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:23,200
All right. Best of luck to those guys. One more time. You can search for that on kickstarter.com.

611
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:26,720
It is retro and I'll probably contribute a little bit for that effort. I think,

612
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:30,720
I think it's a fine, uh, idea they've got over there. And I would,

613
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:33,440
I would not mind having some more magazines to put on the shelves.

614
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:35,520
Maybe this will take my Kickstarter virginity.

615
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:39,120
Ooh. Okay. That's right. You've never donated to a Kickstarter.

616
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:42,400
Because my Amazon payments weren't working every time I freaking try.

617
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:45,360
All right. So by the way, before we move on to the rest of our gaming weeks,

618
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:48,400
I did want to point out over in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com,

619
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:52,560
uh, there wasn't, uh, there was a lot of other chatter that weren't just question for

620
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:57,440
questions for Mike. Uh, but there was chalk going on there about like some other gaming magazine,

621
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:00,160
you know, memories. And we're going to get into that with our Fugu question of the week later,

622
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:04,160
but I did want to point out for dark soccer, a code man was offering to go get high with

623
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:09,200
you on some CMYK fumes. Oh yeah. I, I think I actually started that.

624
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:15,600
There you go. I'm sorry. If you, if you are a print design person, there is no smell as

625
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:22,640
wonderful as stepping into a print shop and smelling the toxic fumes. I have to tell you

626
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:27,200
that traditional ink smells a lot different than the soy ink. And I don't know what I like better.

627
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:32,480
Just saying. Have you smelled a print shop on weed?

628
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:38,640
All right, Loki. Uh, it's time to get over to your gaming week. When we left off, we'd heard

629
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:41,600
it from dark soccer. Let's get into your gaming week and the types of games you've been playing

630
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:45,120
this week. Well, it's really only one type of game. I've been playing Grand Theft Auto five.

631
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:50,720
I did play a little bit of online cause I was trying to catch up my Xbox, uh, 360 character

632
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:58,560
to my PS3 character. So I managed to get up to level 10 on my 360 character. And then I decided,

633
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:03,760
um, uh, well, one night I was trying to play with Bobby, but he kept getting stuck in like

634
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:08,800
full games and I couldn't join his game. So I ended up just going back to single player

635
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:12,000
and trying to finish my a hundred percent stuff. So that's what I've been doing since,

636
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:21,920
uh, earlier this week. And I'm now 82% complete. I think I started, I'm pretty much almost done

637
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:29,600
with the Epsilon program missions and, um, what else did I do? Oh, I finished all the, uh,

638
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:36,640
triathlons, which seriously, rock stars, seriously. There's a 30 minute fucking long triathlon,

639
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:44,080
30 minutes in real time of mashing a mashing a for 30 fucking that sounds about as awesome as

640
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:50,080
desert bus. I, that is so fucking, oh, it's almost as, almost as fun as the part in Epsilon,

641
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:55,520
uh, missions where you have to run for five miles. So I was sitting there running in circles for

642
00:50:55,520 --> 00:51:03,920
about 20 minutes that that was fun. Also mashing a for like a while. Um, and then what else? So,

643
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:12,160
all the races and, um, I think I'm pretty much, I have a buying property and I don't know pretty

644
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:17,600
much. I just have to do a lot of the collectibles and stunt jumps and the planes under the bridges

645
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:23,440
and stuff. Um, so I have to finish that and I think that'll be about it. Um, now much left to

646
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:27,040
go, but I'm going to still work on that. But later this week though, we are going to be doing a vog

647
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:33,200
or two vog gaming nights for grant the thought online one day on PlayStation three, one day on

648
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:38,240
X-Box three 60. So stay tuned the forums. I'm thinking right now that it's going to be Friday,

649
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:44,400
Saturday. I just have to make sure it doesn't conflict with any shows. That's about it.

650
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:48,560
Uh, as long as it's not Saturday night when us L is on, you should be good.

651
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:52,640
If you do it a little earlier in the night, Saturday, Saturday should be fine.

652
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:57,360
Maybe in the middle of week then. Yeah, we'll see. All right. Just stay tuned to the, uh,

653
00:51:57,360 --> 00:52:01,200
forums. We have a thread in the forums and I'll put times there. So sounds good.

654
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:07,520
All right. Uh, my gaming week, uh, I told you all about the, uh, show, uh, that I did on yesterday.

655
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:11,760
So, um, that took a big bite out of most of my gaming time this week, just like last week,

656
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:16,000
unfortunately. Uh, so I'm going to get caught up this week. I did play a little bit of final

657
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:20,960
fantasy 14. Um, not as much as you'd think based on what I said last week. Um, I was fortunate

658
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:25,520
enough to get into hearthstone beta, which is a blizzards, a free to play trading card game.

659
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:29,200
Uh, I talked a little bit about this at length on the hoard house. I'll kind of repeat some of

660
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:34,080
that here. Um, I did enjoy the game well enough, especially for something that's free to play.

661
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:39,440
I found the gameplay to be a little bit basic, but some card game affectionados who know this stuff

662
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:44,000
a little more than I do, uh, seem to really enjoy it and kind of find the depth in it that I'm

663
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:48,800
currently, I guess not seeing or whatever. I was really surprised kind of like that you draw so

664
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:53,920
few cards and it's really like, you know, the man is all just kind of built in. You don't have cards

665
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:57,920
on your own for that or whatever. So, um, but I guess the easy to play thing is really to try to

666
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:02,400
draw in as many people as possible. And kind of my final verdict on hearthstone from what I've

667
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:06,560
played on it so far is that I think it's going to be a great tablet game. And I really look forward

668
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:10,240
to it on tablets because I like the idea of just kind of being able to like, you know, lie in bed

669
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:14,720
before I go to sleep and, you know, play around with just the touch controls. But if I'm sitting

670
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:20,240
down at my PC, I kind of think there's other games I might want to play that, that really aren't

671
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:26,080
hearthstone. Um, one of those games I would want to play is a game I did get a chance to check out

672
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:30,960
quickly this week, which is audio surf 2. Now this game is still in development. It's something

673
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:35,360
that's on steam early access. So I don't want to review the game per se. I just kind of want to

674
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:40,560
say, Hey, it's out there. You can check it out. Uh, one of the big differences I'm noticing between

675
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:45,040
audio surf 2 and audio surf 1, which is a game I really enjoyed too. And if you haven't played

676
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:52,000
audio surf 1, um, it's a game that uses your own music too. And then the first game you had these

677
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:56,640
different modes, but like the main mode was sort of like, you would pick up these colored blocks

678
00:53:56,640 --> 00:54:02,800
as you would speed down a tunnel, uh, that is set to whatever your song is. And it kind of, kind of

679
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:06,960
was like clacks. I don't know if any of you remember that nineties puzzler clacks, remember

680
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:10,000
that where they come down the conveyor belt, the colored pieces would come down the conveyor belt

681
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:15,040
and you try to match three match five. You kind of tried to do that really quick and audio surf,

682
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:20,560
but audio surf had a mode that I thought was way better called the mono mode where it was just

683
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:24,880
pick up, you know, the pieces are black or white and it's just about navigating and being able to

684
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:30,480
move through the field as fast as possible. So you pick up only the pieces that are colorful and not

685
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:35,680
the pieces that are, you know, the wrong color. Um, so I like that mode the best. And it seems

686
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:39,760
like they're trying to kind of capitalize on that a little bit in audio surf 2, at least the modes

687
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:44,000
that are in there right now is kind of the mono mode, but the mode I really like, one of the

688
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:48,000
things they have in there right now is, is like a, um, it's like, Oh, I remember the name of it.

689
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:52,640
It was like a wave race type of mode, because what you can do is that like, let's say, you know,

690
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:57,120
you're about to go down a big hill because when the tempo of the song picks up, you start to go

691
00:54:57,120 --> 00:55:01,360
down a hill. Well, what you do is you swing your character all the way to a side of the side of

692
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:05,760
the tunnel and click the mouse button and they'll like fly up in the air. And then you're flying

693
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:10,000
down the hill and you do tricks in the air. And then you kind of land like, it's like,

694
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:13,360
like you're in like a jet ski type thing and you do these tricks. And I thought that was a really

695
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:18,960
cool little innovation. And that's like, I, the way that plays and feels because, you know,

696
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:23,120
that's when the crescendos of the music happens. So to kind of do like this whole, like,

697
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:26,960
right when the crescendo of a big dance song hits, like boom, I'm going to go flying in the

698
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:31,440
air and do all these tricks. Like it's, it's really rewarding in that sort of way. So, um,

699
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:36,480
yeah, I'm, I'm liking what I'm seeing of audio surf 2 so far, I guess one of the other big

700
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:40,480
things they're going to do with it is mods. They want to have more and more mods and user created

701
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:46,240
stuff. I imagine this is going to be a part of that steam, uh, what do they call this steam

702
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:50,000
community marketplace or something like that, where people can make their own stuff like they

703
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:54,160
have with Skyrim and civilization and stuff. I can't imagine this game isn't going to incorporate

704
00:55:54,160 --> 00:56:00,080
that big time. So, uh, yeah, I am looking forward to seeing what further develops audio surf too,

705
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:03,840
but that's pretty much been my gaming week is just those games. Otherwise I've been pretty busy

706
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:08,880
with other stuff. So let's get into some housekeeping and then we'll get into the news

707
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:12,720
tonight. Uh, for tonight's housekeeping, I did want to mention quickly because I forgot to

708
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:19,520
mention last week. Um, I, uh, was on a, another show, uh, the let's wow podcast last week,

709
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:24,080
episode 31 that is now on the feed. But when I was talking about that, I forgot to plug,

710
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:29,600
uh, gamut's stream that he's doing this Tuesday on into Wednesday, he's going to be doing a 24

711
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:35,120
hour live stream for charity. He's raising money for breast cancer awareness month. He's trying to,

712
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:38,800
you know, kind of bring attention to that, especially because, uh, world of Warcraft

713
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:43,120
has such a huge community behind it and the online gaming stuff in general. I think, uh, you know,

714
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:47,760
it's a great way to kind of say, Oh, Hey, while you're playing these games, don't forget that

715
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:53,120
there's this type of awareness going on in the real world. And, you know, uh, cancer really sucks

716
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:57,760
and we have to keep fighting it and raising money through research. So, um, I think that's really

717
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:01,600
cool that he's doing this video game, uh, live stream to support that. Uh, so I want to give

718
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:06,640
that a plug. You can check out more information on his website, gamuthunts.com. Uh, and he'll be

719
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:12,720
streaming that on his Twitch channel on Tuesday. Uh, otherwise the only other thing I can think of

720
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:19,040
to plug here is that of course we are on Twitter, twitter.com slash O L R. We're also on Facebook,

721
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:26,240
facebook.com slash orange lounge radio. And, uh, I think that's it. That's all I've got to plug

722
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:31,440
right now. So I guess we should get into some news. Loki. All right. So, um, let's talk a

723
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:39,520
little bit about, um, new devices coming out and you may remember we talked briefly about the Mojo,

724
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:44,320
which I think is pretty cool. The Mad Catz micro console that's going to have Android games and

725
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:49,760
stuff on it. What's kind of unique about it is that it can actually play normal Android games.

726
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:56,160
It's not a separate marketplace. You can actually map the controls and stuff. The only problem with

727
00:57:57,120 --> 00:58:03,120
it though is it's $250. Um, but yeah, so they announced $250. It's up for pre-order. Ships in

728
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:10,640
December, tentatively. Um, some of the specs on it. It's going to be, uh, it's going to have 16

729
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:21,040
gigabytes of storage with a micro SD, uh, support. Also they have, um, I guess, uh, a 1.8 gigahertz

730
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:26,160
Tegra 4 processor. So it's definitely more powerful than like say an Ouya and it comes

731
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:32,000
with a special, um, uh, controller that's Bluetooth enabled, which allows you to also,

732
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:38,560
uh, I guess use it on like Android or as a PC controller or even use like mouse input and stuff.

733
00:58:39,360 --> 00:58:43,840
Um, so that's pretty cool. And then one of the other cool things that you can do with this,

734
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:49,760
and I guess it kind of helps warrant the $250 price point is that you can actually stream PC

735
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:55,520
games with it. So that's going to be coming, I think after it launches. Um, and it's going to

736
00:58:55,520 --> 00:59:00,800
wait a minute. Loki, isn't that supposed to be the steam machines thing? Well, technically, yeah,

737
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:06,720
I guess it could be, but, um, I think it's kind of cool. Uh, they've got, let's see,

738
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:16,000
here's some more specs on the Mojo, uh, two gigs of Ram and, um, one USB 2.0 and one USB 3.0 port.

739
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:23,080
I mean, that's pretty cool that it supports that Bluetooth 4.0 and it's running Android 4.22. Um,

740
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:28,880
and they even have a headphone socket on there. So that's kind of cool. You can listen to your

741
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:35,760
audio through that. Um, I don't know. I think for the, for 250 bucks and it can stream games

742
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:41,920
to your TV. That's kind of cool. If it was just strictly an Android box, um, that probably

743
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:48,560
wouldn't be worth it for 250 bucks. So I don't know. What would you think would make, make it

744
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:54,880
worth the cost for 250 bucks? It's going to do a lot more than just, you know, play Android games.

745
00:59:54,880 --> 01:00:01,040
I think, um, the controller looks nice at least. It's just, you mean you can, I guess a lot of

746
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:06,240
people have their phones and stuff and it would cost a lot less to probably just get an HDMI out

747
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:11,280
on your phone or get some other type of streaming thing. Uh, since it does support Android, I

748
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:17,200
suppose you could also use this as like a box to watch Netflix or Hulu or anything like that on.

749
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:22,880
Um, so there's just my living room needs another Netflix device. I don't have any of those. Some

750
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:27,840
people don't have a lot of stuff or some people might want a second one or third or fourth or

751
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:33,760
whatever. Um, and plus it looks kind of nice. I mean, it's shiny. It's got blue light on front.

752
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:38,080
I don't normally purchase my consoles based on lights, but it definitely looks better.

753
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:46,240
Um, 57 LEDs. I think the price was a little expensive. Maybe if it comes down to price

754
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:51,040
later on, it might be worth it for me. But, um, I just don't need any more consoles right now,

755
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:59,200
but the controller looks nice. I mean, if I could use on 360 or a PS3, I might be down with that.

756
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:05,200
All right. Well, uh, going to some stories about the Xbox one happening out there, uh, there was,

757
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:11,040
so a lot of talk this week about, uh, you know, there's been a lot of talk about the connect

758
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:14,960
and privacy and all that, you know, ever since they announced the whole always on thing, there

759
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:19,120
was the concerns about privacy. Well, I don't think it's even necessarily that it's more ever

760
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:23,120
since they announced, you know, all that, all that stuff leaking out and no Microsoft's in bed with

761
01:01:23,120 --> 01:01:27,680
the NSA type thing. Well, yeah, yeah. But I mean, this is even really about that, but it's been on

762
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:31,760
people's minds because of that ever since they announced the system. And, uh, this was kind of

763
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:35,200
an interesting, uh, development on that this week. Uh, I'm going to totally pronounce this

764
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:40,240
name, so I apologize, but it's Yusuf Mehdi, who is the corporate vice president of marketing and

765
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:44,400
strategy for Microsoft was talking to the national advertisers, masters of marketing conference.

766
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:48,960
This is happening in Phoenix, uh, earlier this week, he was talking about some of the, uh,

767
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:53,600
things that the Xbox one could do that could actually affect marketing and how it's going to be,

768
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:59,440
um, even bigger than the PlayStation four in terms of the marketing. And this would have to do with,

769
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:05,040
Xbox's imaging technology, uh, talking about moving the gamification movement along and

770
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:09,680
advertise me. And if you haven't heard that term gamification before, uh, you know, it's

771
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:14,800
making games out of advertising, like, you know, interactive flash type things. Uh, the fact that

772
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:19,760
like, like, uh, take a social app, like four square is gamifying social media by, you know,

773
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:23,920
you check in, you get points, there's the mayor ship, there's all that. That's all gamification

774
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:30,400
because games are fun. Look at vog network.com gamified, uh, a radio network of independent

775
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:34,000
podcasts and kind of made a game out of that. That's, that's gamification. The catch pull ones.

776
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:38,720
We have to park the car to get your catch. Yes. Which we actually use on vog network.com,

777
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:43,520
which is a fun one. Yeah. Or reverse the people who use their advertising as a catch.

778
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:49,120
Oh yeah. Where you have to type in like, you know, the product, what product is blah, blah, blah.

779
01:02:49,120 --> 01:02:53,360
Just do it. You know, you have to type in the slogan or whatever, but anyway, uh, talking about

780
01:02:53,360 --> 01:02:59,360
also consolidating, uh, more attention that's diffused otherwise on multiple devices. Uh,

781
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:05,200
X-Box one will make it easier to port real time fantasy football data into the TV screen as people

782
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:09,920
watch their NFL games. It does sound kind of interesting. I know some people that are really

783
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:15,120
into fantasy football and I could sort of see that with a connects going to help do that. Well,

784
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:19,920
the X-Box one does that because it's that whole like connect supposed to do that. You can watch

785
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:24,240
the TV and like the three quarters window and then around the edge kind of has your game,

786
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:28,320
gamify or whatever. Yeah. But I'm just trying to figure out how the connect is actually

787
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:33,520
going to enhance something that basically I could feed into it. Normally I'm just saying like,

788
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:39,600
unless is it going to recognize that, you know, say I'm following me on my team of players because

789
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:45,920
it knows my face. And so that's going to display that stat, those stats. And I don't know. Well,

790
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:52,640
anyway, some of this chat led people to believe that, uh, Oh, they're going to harvest ad data

791
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:58,400
through the connect. But, uh, Microsoft came out after all of this and said, hold on, no, no,

792
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:04,560
this is not what we're doing. Uh, and, uh, yeah, this just said, nobody is working on that. That's

793
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:08,880
not something that happened. It is not going to happen without the user having control over it.

794
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:13,200
But see, here's my opinion. They can say this until they're blue in the face,

795
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:19,440
but this ultimately becomes an issue of, do you trust Microsoft? And that can be very frustrating

796
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:23,120
for a company like Microsoft. Like we're not doing it. Why won't people believe us?

797
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:28,720
But there's some people out there that have that distrust question. That corporate stuff

798
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:33,600
probably comes from the fact that there's all these dirty rumors out there of all these

799
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:37,120
horrible things that Microsoft could possibly be doing. And then they came out and said,

800
01:04:37,120 --> 01:04:41,760
yep, we're going to do all that. And then Sony said, Nope, we're not going to do all that.

801
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:46,000
And then Microsoft said, no, we're actually not going to do that now. And we're not going to do

802
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,960
that now. And we're not going to do that now because, because you people don't like it,

803
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:53,840
but we may implement those features in the future. You know, it's just,

804
01:04:55,760 --> 01:05:00,320
you know, it's a whole flip-flopping that makes people kind of unwary about that stuff.

805
01:05:00,320 --> 01:05:09,040
Um, I think, I mean, what was kind of, I don't know, I guess concerning would have been the

806
01:05:09,040 --> 01:05:13,600
features that, okay, we can recognize individual people. We can cater ads based on those people

807
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:18,080
that are, happen to be sitting in front of, you know, the screen. We can recognize, you know,

808
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:22,080
whether they're looking at the ad because we can see where their eyes are looking or something

809
01:05:22,080 --> 01:05:26,560
like that, you know, or, you know, they're how long they're engaged in watching that.

810
01:05:26,560 --> 01:05:31,360
Some of this has to do with patents too. Like, you know, and, and it causes a lot of buzz going

811
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:36,240
on through. Cause I remember when was it wasn't Microsoft that has that patent for, it can detect

812
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:41,280
like who is actually watching the film and lock the person who's not the owner out of watching

813
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:45,680
the movie or see like if there's more than 10 people watching the movie that, you know,

814
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:49,440
it could charge a different rate or something like that. And people really ran with that patent,

815
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:53,360
even though it's just a patent. It's not something that they're actually necessarily thinking about

816
01:05:53,360 --> 01:05:56,880
doing. I don't remember. I apologize if I'm misrepresenting the facts. I don't remember

817
01:05:56,880 --> 01:06:00,960
if that was Microsoft or Sony. I'm pretty sure it was Microsoft, but we have a live chat. I'm

818
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:04,960
sure I'll get corrected here in a minute if I was wrong, but I seem to recall that was an issue like

819
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:10,560
a year ago on the show gamification of stuff with connect and like these stupid interactive ads and

820
01:06:10,560 --> 01:06:15,280
stuff through connect on the Microsoft. Well, it's funny, funny you say that. Cause Tiger

821
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:19,680
Claude chat at live.hognetwork.com says you think they'll have achievements just for watching an ad

822
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:23,760
and a dark soccer. You're responding to him in chat, talking about Gaia online,

823
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:28,480
which kind of does something like that. Yeah. You like get Gaia gold for doing surveys and

824
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:32,400
watching their stupid little ads. I used to do Gaia back in the day. Well, I think, okay,

825
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:37,760
well maybe Microsoft doesn't necessarily have that yet, but you got achievements from playing

826
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:43,040
those Burger King games. There was achievements in Yaris, which was an adver game, but Burger King

827
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:47,520
games were just genius. I actually get the Burger King games were really like, and I'm very

828
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:52,320
disappointed that there's no new Burger King games because they were, they were creepy in their own

829
01:06:52,320 --> 01:06:58,400
way and it was just, it was fun. But besides, besides all of that, uh, I also think though

830
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:02,240
that, you know, Microsoft has said there's going to be an achievement for like day one

831
01:07:02,240 --> 01:07:07,520
Xbox purchasing, like a day one adopter. So, I mean, that might not be advertising per se,

832
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:11,440
but they are definitely willing to put achievements in things that are not games.

833
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:17,280
Well, they are there. I think they were talking about like TV watching and stuff like that is

834
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:22,160
part of an achievement. Plus remember now Xbox rewards and stuff, they give you rewards for

835
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:25,840
doing different things. Who's to say they couldn't give you rewards for watching ads.

836
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:31,520
Code man in our chat room at live.thognetwork.com says it's not that we need less marketing. It's

837
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:37,920
that we need more less annoying marketing. Well, let me ask this tough question. What is that?

838
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:43,120
Then what, what is marketing that is not annoying? I think that's a tough question to answer because

839
01:07:43,120 --> 01:07:48,320
I think whenever a lot of people feel like they're being kind of like pandered to or marketed to,

840
01:07:48,320 --> 01:07:52,800
they might feel a little bit annoyed. So what's not annoying? I actually don't mind product

841
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:58,080
placement in a game or in a movie as long as it's not obtrusive.

842
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:04,240
Like, you know, the billboards and crazy taxis, what I think of, or take me to KFC, you know,

843
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:08,480
like I didn't, I wasn't annoyed with that. I actually found it funny. It was kind of funny

844
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:12,720
or, you know, it's stuff that you see in real life. You know, you're driving through the town,

845
01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:18,000
you may see an ad for, you know, like a racing game. They have all the Valvoline and

846
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:21,600
Ferrelli and all that, you know, that's what you see at an actual racing track.

847
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:28,080
That's realistic advertising in the game. Or, you know, for example, character walks into,

848
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:35,600
you know, a snack room and goes to a Pepsi machine and gets a Diet Pepsi. That's unobtrusive

849
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:39,200
marketing. That's something that would happen in real life. It all depends. I mean, I've seen

850
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:42,640
people complain about that kind of stuff in, you know, games where they'll have, you know,

851
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:48,240
Mountain Dew or something. And it's like, so you're 22 or five or something ridiculous,

852
01:08:48,240 --> 01:08:51,760
you know, in the future. And there's all these Mountain Dew machines everywhere.

853
01:08:51,760 --> 01:08:57,120
I think like, if you want to do, I think people need to feel, because right now they feel, okay,

854
01:08:57,120 --> 01:09:03,040
we're being charged for online. And now we're also being advertised to at the same time, because

855
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:08,000
look at the PlayStation network. They don't really have ads all over the place on the PlayStation,

856
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:11,920
you know, cross media bar. There's not ads. I mean, there's a little advertisement ticker

857
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:15,920
thing in the corner. We're talking about sales and stuff and games coming up, but it's not like

858
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:20,320
a Doritos commercial or something like that. Your system defaults to what's new and it might show,

859
01:09:20,320 --> 01:09:23,680
like it'll show things that you own, but it'll also show things that are in the marketplace

860
01:09:23,680 --> 01:09:27,200
in there, but that's not terrible. But that's, that's not really that bad.

861
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:32,880
But Microsoft though, they have fucking little tiles with, you know, ads in them. And a lot of

862
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:36,960
people think, well, wait a second. And especially, you know, just comparing stuff in the current gen

863
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:44,560
marketplace, you have Microsoft that's charging for online, Sony that's not charging for online.

864
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:49,680
There's no ads there. And Microsoft on top of charging you, they're also throwing ads in your

865
01:09:49,680 --> 01:09:55,200
face, whether it be in the corner of the screen and you don't necessarily have to see it, you

866
01:09:55,200 --> 01:10:00,880
know, but it's still there. And people are like, what the fuck? You know, aren't you getting enough

867
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:05,680
money from me already? And now you're making ad dollars on top of that. And so that's kind of

868
01:10:05,680 --> 01:10:10,560
where the problem is. Xenocore in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says beer commercials are

869
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:14,640
awesome marketing. Most interesting man in the world is awesome marketing. You know, that kind

870
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:18,320
of had me thinking is that, well, you know, it is very interesting when we talk about marketing

871
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:22,800
vices, especially things like beer, you know, who has traditionally had, you know, Budweiser has

872
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:27,120
had some of the like biggest commercials you can possibly think of out there in history.

873
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:30,800
And then I kind of think of, you know, what's really fascinating. And this is kind of an

874
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:34,800
unpopular opinion. I'm not saying it's good. I'm just saying it's fascinating is that look at the

875
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:38,880
history of cigarette advertising, because those people are having stones. Well, those people

876
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:45,440
are having to advertise something that they know kills people. So it's, it's, it's really amazing

877
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:50,880
to see how they market that. Well, have you looked into the history of cigarette marketing?

878
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:55,440
Not like professionally, but I just, I can think of what I saw when I was a kid, back when there

879
01:10:55,440 --> 01:11:00,880
were vending machines and restaurants and what I see now, they used to do Marlboro ads featuring

880
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:05,200
the Flintstones. It was like Marlboro tastes good, like a cigarette should. And then they

881
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:12,880
would have doctor endorsements in magazines prior to the sixties. They would have actual written

882
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:18,480
doctor endorsements for cigarettes being good for you. You know, and of course, you know, now

883
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:23,280
truth in advertising is a really, really big thing. So of course we don't have that anymore,

884
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:30,320
nor do we have the television ads. Or the old, although I have seen those little vending machines

885
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:35,120
repurposed. I have too. Yeah. That's kind of funny how they'll put those old cigarette

886
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:40,560
machines to use. There's a, I think at the Crocker museum, they actually do, um, replicas of some of

887
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:45,840
the art pieces or, or it's small scale or the flip because they don't really make cigarette vending

888
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:49,760
machines anymore. At least not in California. Like if you go to a bar where they do sell cigarettes

889
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:53,120
in the outdoor area, which is the only place you can smoke. It's like the type of vending machine

890
01:11:53,120 --> 01:11:58,560
that sells chips and cookies in other places with a little, it's, it's fascinating to me.

891
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:02,960
I miss the old cigarette machine aesthetic, even if I don't agree with the product. Yeah, yeah,

892
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:09,200
yeah. No, the old cigarette machine, I should say that kind of cool, but like the knob and outcome,

893
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:15,440
your smoke, but that's also marketing in a way. And it's, it's cigarettes that are,

894
01:12:15,440 --> 01:12:20,080
you're not supposed to be having, but keep in mind this happened. Remember what I mentioned

895
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:28,160
about the Crocker. They're using an almost a cultural artifact that we once associated with

896
01:12:28,160 --> 01:12:32,960
cigarettes. We know it's a, its purpose is to sell you something. Instead of selling you

897
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:39,360
something harmful is selling you something beautiful. Although art is relative. Anyway,

898
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:44,000
anyhow, we're getting a little off track here a little, but, uh, yeah, advertising, um,

899
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:48,800
who knows what's going to develop in the future as, as entertainment gets more and more and more

900
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:53,280
interactive, uh, they'll come up with something. Anyhow, Dark Sakura, before we get to release

901
01:12:53,280 --> 01:12:59,040
dates. Oh man, rage nator. I am not going to quote Dennis Larry except for, uh, what is it?

902
01:12:59,040 --> 01:13:05,200
You, you have the, you, how about life's going to suck when you grow up, when you have the orgasm,

903
01:13:05,200 --> 01:13:08,080
you smoke the, but you eat a cookie, you go to bed and that's the end of the story

904
01:13:09,280 --> 01:13:16,000
about what the meaning of happiness anyway. So, um, oh yeah. And the, uh, I only want to eat

905
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:22,160
meat from cows that smoke. Oh, okay. Video games, Silent Hill. How about Silent Hill?

906
01:13:24,240 --> 01:13:28,000
I'm going to have to smoke just to get through that game. My God. Just kidding.

907
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:35,120
Don't you know that's what the fog is. So anyway, um, way forward, um, did Silent Hill

908
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:40,720
book of memories. And, uh, it turns out though that before they did Contra four that they were,

909
01:13:40,720 --> 01:13:48,240
um, they had a prototype out for, um, a, uh, another Silent Hill game for the Nintendo DS

910
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:54,400
and their little prototype starred, um, the dude from Silent Hill two. And it had, uh,

911
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:58,560
there was some video out about it, about, you know, what it was supposed to, to look like.

912
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:04,000
But of course that got canceled and they also had, and this makes me think back to the whole,

913
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:12,800
um, biohazard, uh, 1.5 where, um, they had a completely different version of Silent Hill book

914
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:19,840
of memories and ended up, I suppose, scrapping it and doing it what we have now. But, uh,

915
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:24,880
the, um, quote on there was saying is that they had, uh, two different perspectives for in the

916
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:32,000
game. This one would switch between an isometric and an over the shoulder. And they were looking

917
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:39,280
more at the combat and puzzle, uh, elements, um, to zoom out, but they said that the technology

918
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:45,520
just wasn't there to do it. So they switched how they did it. Um, but there is a video out

919
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:51,520
there of what the, uh, I'd say original concept of chain of memories was for anyone who's interested

920
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:58,560
in it, which for me, I love, um, I love looking at prototypes and the differences. I would still

921
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:04,560
love to find a playable, um, biohazard 1.5 just so that I could see for myself what the differences

922
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:10,480
were. But I love when they come out and say, well, this is what you almost got unless what

923
01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:15,280
we almost got would have been better. You know what I mean? But I wouldn't have minded having a

924
01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:22,800
good, um, solid Silent Hill game on my DS. Yeah. Book of memories got a lot of kind of hate though.

925
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:26,960
It wasn't it. See the thing with book of memories, like I didn't hate the game, but it wasn't

926
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:31,600
Silent Hill to me. It was very much not Silent Hill to me, which it was definitely like more of

927
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:36,080
like a spinoff type of game. I haven't wanted to play a Silent Hill game since homecoming.

928
01:15:36,720 --> 01:15:41,360
I think honestly think that homecoming is the last, I'm not even going to say great Silent

929
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:47,680
Hill game. It's one of the last good faithful Silent Hill games to me. So. All right. Well,

930
01:15:47,680 --> 01:15:51,120
let's travel around the world and check out release dates of games that will, you know,

931
01:15:51,120 --> 01:15:56,080
actually be coming out. You know, it's pretty good that that Silent Hill game didn't come out because

932
01:15:56,080 --> 01:16:00,160
if you remember correctly, uh, all the portable Silent Hill games haven't been very good. Like

933
01:16:00,160 --> 01:16:05,680
you remember the PSP ones and stuff. It's just. I never really played the PSP one. I remember it

934
01:16:05,680 --> 01:16:12,320
though. That was origins, right? Uh, I think, yeah, cause I'm confusing. There's that PSP one.

935
01:16:12,320 --> 01:16:19,360
They ported it to PS2. Oh yeah. Okay. Um, anyways, this week, not a whole ton of stuff coming out.

936
01:16:19,360 --> 01:16:26,640
It's more of like a, uh, catch up week, I guess. Um, so PlayStation three, Xbox 360, and Wii.

937
01:16:27,200 --> 01:16:32,800
You've, I hope you like hunting because, uh, Cabela's African adventures, uh, will be coming

938
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:46,240
out this week. Also on, um, was it a PlayStation three as well? Uh, see here we had, I want to say

939
01:16:46,240 --> 01:16:50,320
was it this guy? Yeah, this guy did too. No, actually that was last week. I'm sorry. Uh,

940
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:58,400
Cabela's are not Cabela's. So wipe out, create and crash on Wii U, 3DS, Wii, um, Xbox 360.

941
01:16:59,360 --> 01:17:05,600
And of course the Xbox 360 one's a connect game. Also, what else was there this week?

942
01:17:06,320 --> 01:17:09,120
Seriously? Not a lot of anything. Um,

943
01:17:12,080 --> 01:17:17,680
it's not it. That can't be it. You all right. There's just not a lot of,

944
01:17:17,680 --> 01:17:21,360
there's a lot of garbage coming out. Oh, here we go. You're just weeding through the garbage

945
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:26,720
right now through the garbage. Yeah. Cause, um, and last year, last few things this week,

946
01:17:26,720 --> 01:17:35,120
a cradle of Egypt to, uh, for 3DS and girls fashioned shoot on 3DS. That's literally it.

947
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:41,520
Alrighty. All right. Uh, going to Japan and checking out what is coming out in Japan.

948
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:47,120
Yeah, I should, I should have called her and been like, Hey, I hate to interrupt your honeymoon and

949
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:52,000
God knows what's going on right now, but are there lines for another monster hunter? I know

950
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:55,920
I got to ask you what's on the shelves over there. We do have to get her and silent Nathan back on

951
01:17:55,920 --> 01:18:01,280
the show though. Miss them. All right. Uh, coming out on October 17th, uh, on the PlayStation three

952
01:18:01,280 --> 01:18:05,680
over in Japan beyond two souls is getting its release in Japan is the first print limited

953
01:18:05,680 --> 01:18:10,800
edition, uh, as well as regular, uh, FIFA 14 world-class soccer and some various, uh,

954
01:18:10,880 --> 01:18:15,680
additions, St. Seiya, brave soldiers and regular limited edition.

955
01:18:15,680 --> 01:18:20,800
No way. They're doing a St. Seiya game? Brave soldiers. That's an old series.

956
01:18:21,680 --> 01:18:26,560
So that's, uh, yeah, that's coming out on the PlayStation three, uh, coming out on the

957
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:32,880
Xbox 360 this week in Japan. Um, FIFA 14, cause you know, that game is huge and there's a like

958
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:39,920
Xbox live card kind of pack-ins to go with that. Uh, on the Vita this week, FIFA 14 is there as

959
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:45,200
well. I'm thinking the FIFA 14 is kind of a big release this week. Uh, but on the Wii U it's all

960
01:18:45,200 --> 01:18:50,560
about Rayman legends, which sees this release in Japan this week on October the 17th. Uh,

961
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:56,720
lastly checking the 3DS here. Uh, actually not a lot of stuff this week, probably just cause

962
01:18:56,720 --> 01:19:01,920
they're coming off the Pokemon high. There's still a lot of cases and accessories and things,

963
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:08,240
but there is one game coming out from Namco Bandai this week. And, uh, I'm going to butcher this name.

964
01:19:08,240 --> 01:19:17,440
It is Sentotuchu Densetsu no Shinobi 2 Survival Battle. And all I have is a screenshot and the

965
01:19:17,440 --> 01:19:22,720
little subtitle on it is battle for money. So it looks like kind of like a ninja fighting type of

966
01:19:22,720 --> 01:19:26,720
game. It also says Fuji television. So what if this isn't based on some type of game show

967
01:19:26,720 --> 01:19:32,480
in Japan, or maybe it's like a ninja, you know, like a ninja warrior type of,

968
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:37,280
they get all the cool shows, a ninja fighting game or a fighting show. Yeah. I just noticed

969
01:19:37,280 --> 01:19:41,200
that there's a little copyright Fuji television. So it's gotta be based on some type of TV show.

970
01:19:41,200 --> 01:19:46,800
So it looks kind of fun, but that's it for Japanese release dates. Uh, how about the UK

971
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:54,960
Darusaka? Uh, well, let's see, there's not a whole big pile of stuff coming out. We have on the 17th,

972
01:19:54,960 --> 01:20:01,440
we have device six for, uh, IOS. We have pocket Titans also for IOS. And on the 18th,

973
01:20:01,520 --> 01:20:07,760
we have alien rage. We have Skylanders swap force and Skyla, uh, actually two different

974
01:20:07,760 --> 01:20:13,680
versions of a Skylanders swap force. Looks like the handheld, um, the 3DS,

975
01:20:13,680 --> 01:20:18,720
Xbox three 60 Wii U Wii PlayStation three. And then they're separating their release for the

976
01:20:18,720 --> 01:20:27,440
PlayStation four and the Xbox one. So that's it. Like I said, it was a little, yep. Not so small.

977
01:20:27,440 --> 01:20:31,440
You know, everybody's just too busy playing Pokemon except for all of us here at OLR.

978
01:20:33,040 --> 01:20:39,520
I I'll get in on that craze. I am not going to make poor Isabel make meth in the basement of

979
01:20:39,520 --> 01:20:46,400
my town hall to keep my flowers pretty. I just got Lobo and I just got Peck and I got Margie.

980
01:20:46,400 --> 01:20:50,560
I'm playing in my village. So you're not, you refuse to give up one addiction for another

981
01:20:51,680 --> 01:20:55,600
bitch, please. But as I told you, you can't visit my town this week to get petition signatures

982
01:20:55,600 --> 01:21:00,720
because my town went to Japan. My entire town got up and flew to Japan this week.

983
01:21:00,720 --> 01:21:07,920
That's okay. And Lord knows how princess Irene is corrupting my villagers at this very moment.

984
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:11,360
It won't be the same. You want to know what's funny is that remember how butch

985
01:21:11,360 --> 01:21:14,640
moved from my town to yours, but she's been hanging out in my shopping center.

986
01:21:15,200 --> 01:21:16,480
So butch didn't want to go to Japan.

987
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:25,200
All right. It's like they're real people. Okay. A few more news stories for you guys.

988
01:21:25,200 --> 01:21:28,320
Then the classic game of the week. But first, a very new game, right,

989
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:30,960
Loki? And that's the best part about it is they're not even people.

990
01:21:34,320 --> 01:21:40,080
Yeah. Speaking of addictions, Grand Theft Auto five is officially broken. A bunch of records,

991
01:21:40,720 --> 01:21:47,600
including the PlayStation Network record for the most downloaded title in history of the

992
01:21:47,600 --> 01:21:54,800
PlayStation Network. And there's also some Guinness Book Records, which I don't know. So anyways,

993
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:59,040
let's see. Best selling action adventure video game in twenty four hours. Best selling video

994
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:05,200
game in twenty four hours. And they really narrow it down. Fastest entertainment property to gross

995
01:22:05,200 --> 01:22:09,840
one billion dollars. Fastest video game to gross one billion dollars. Highest

996
01:22:09,840 --> 01:22:14,160
grossing video game in twenty four hours. Highest revenue generated by an entertainment product in

997
01:22:14,160 --> 01:22:20,160
twenty four hours. And the most viewed trailer for an action adventure video game. I don't know

998
01:22:20,160 --> 01:22:22,960
if they really need trailer in there. I mean, that's just like.

999
01:22:25,200 --> 01:22:28,560
Can they go to advertisement? Can they go too far with like, you know,

1000
01:22:30,240 --> 01:22:35,600
breaking down these records? I mean, this is all press release fodder. I mean, it is,

1001
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:39,840
although I shouldn't belittle some of these accomplishments, because obviously Grand Theft

1002
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:45,360
Auto, whether you like it or not or like it too much or not, it is a huge thing in the gaming

1003
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:51,040
industry, huge. And, you know, these records do back that up that that what a practically

1004
01:22:51,040 --> 01:22:55,920
practically a cultural event these things are. I mean, when your video game gets parodied on

1005
01:22:55,920 --> 01:23:00,800
Saturday Night Live, whether that show is funny or not anymore, I mean, that is saying something.

1006
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:04,080
And I don't know if you saw like the whole like angry mom sketch where she was talking

1007
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:07,440
about Grand Theft Auto five on Weekend Update. But the twist was that, like,

1008
01:23:07,440 --> 01:23:10,160
she's not angry at the game. She's angry because she can't stop playing it.

1009
01:23:10,160 --> 01:23:17,840
So, you know, I actually remember way back the David Chappelle show where he did the Grand Theft

1010
01:23:17,840 --> 01:23:22,560
Auto parody. I do remember that switching like if your life was Grand Theft Auto.

1011
01:23:22,560 --> 01:23:25,280
Yeah, that was funny. That was pretty funny. I remember that. Good stuff.

1012
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:31,520
Also, Grand Theft Auto Online, there's been some hiccups, but they almost have it all taken care

1013
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:36,960
of and to kind of compensate players and maybe get people more interested in checking out online.

1014
01:23:37,040 --> 01:23:43,120
If you played any portion of the online in the month of October,

1015
01:23:43,120 --> 01:23:48,720
you get a half a million dollars in in-game money. Yeah, that's in-game money,

1016
01:23:48,720 --> 01:23:52,400
not an actual half million dollars. I wish that'd be awesome.

1017
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:59,520
So some of the headlines I saw out there was GTA to give their players a half million dollars.

1018
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:03,040
And then you click on the link and then the sub headline is in in-game cash.

1019
01:24:03,440 --> 01:24:09,440
Of course, you bastard. Click me, click me. Of course, you know, you have to play during the

1020
01:24:09,440 --> 01:24:16,720
month of October. You will have to also install the upcoming title update 1.04, which is going

1021
01:24:16,720 --> 01:24:22,720
to fix some other problems and causing vehicle purchase losses and stuff like that. And then

1022
01:24:22,720 --> 01:24:28,240
they're going to there's going to be two deposits of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars.

1023
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:34,080
I'm not sure when those are going to be coming up. It's like right after each other or if it's

1024
01:24:34,080 --> 01:24:39,840
just, you know. Don't know how to do it, but that's cool. More money. Money's good.

1025
01:24:42,640 --> 01:24:48,800
Then, of course, you know, it's interesting. This sort of happened with Grand Theft Auto

1026
01:24:48,800 --> 01:24:54,080
San Andreas, except it wasn't necessarily that, you know, an artist was trying to sue the game

1027
01:24:54,080 --> 01:25:00,480
because their music was being used without their permission, but it's because they thought the

1028
01:25:00,480 --> 01:25:07,280
game was based off of their lifestyle. But anyways, there's an artist saying that he

1029
01:25:07,280 --> 01:25:16,080
wants his music taken out of the game, and that's Daz Dillinger. And he has a couple tracks in there

1030
01:25:16,080 --> 01:25:22,080
with, I guess, Corrupt under the group banner The Dog Pound. And so there's two tracks and

1031
01:25:22,080 --> 01:25:27,040
he's saying that he was offered four thousand or four thousand two hundred seventy one dollars for

1032
01:25:27,040 --> 01:25:36,960
his songs. But then I guess. Pass that offer up and I guess they use the music in in game,

1033
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:41,840
and now he thinks that he's do more money. I think what happened is, is they tried to go to

1034
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:46,000
the artist to license the track and end up going to the record label instead and licensing the

1035
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:50,320
track. And now he's pissed off that he feels because they made a billion dollars that he

1036
01:25:50,320 --> 01:25:53,760
wants more money or something. Right. Right. Which it sounds like he needs to take up the

1037
01:25:53,760 --> 01:25:57,600
issue with his label, because the label's probably the one that sold the song out.

1038
01:25:57,600 --> 01:26:01,920
And if they paid for the studio and they paid him to make the song, they own it, whether,

1039
01:26:02,640 --> 01:26:07,440
you know. Unless there's something specifically in his contract about royalties. Which there could

1040
01:26:07,440 --> 01:26:12,400
be. Yeah. We don't know. But it's weird to me. Like, I realize that that's kind of like the

1041
01:26:12,400 --> 01:26:17,200
generally accepted like rationale of what Rockstar did and so forth. But what I don't get about it is

1042
01:26:17,200 --> 01:26:22,320
that like, why were those songs so damn important? Like, you know, when we're talking about how huge

1043
01:26:22,320 --> 01:26:27,600
this game is, I would think most artists would want to be in a game like this. Are those songs

1044
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:35,840
like, are they necessary to the plot? No. Like the Kanye song in Saints Row 3, kind of like,

1045
01:26:35,840 --> 01:26:39,840
you can't do that scene without the song. It's really awesome. Exactly. You'd have to have

1046
01:26:39,840 --> 01:26:44,320
certain songs. But like, are those songs necessary? No, it's just on the radio. They don't really.

1047
01:26:44,880 --> 01:26:49,200
On the other thing too, is that he broke with those groups. Yeah. So the guy's actually not,

1048
01:26:49,200 --> 01:26:54,480
unless it has to be some sort of bitterness association, you know, oh, I fell out with them.

1049
01:26:54,480 --> 01:27:00,080
They owe me money. So there's, but I mean, there's probably tons of independent rap artists to get

1050
01:27:00,080 --> 01:27:04,560
featured in a Grand Theft Auto game that would like, they would pay Rockstar money to have that

1051
01:27:04,560 --> 01:27:07,920
opportunity. There's some good artists in there. In fact, like I started listening to some of the

1052
01:27:07,920 --> 01:27:11,520
other stations because I was just listening to the classic rock station and actually have been

1053
01:27:11,520 --> 01:27:16,560
listening to the pop station now, even though Britney's on there. And, uh, Britney Spears song

1054
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:23,120
Grand Theft Auto. They have, uh, Gimme More. That is one of my favorites. I was listening to the

1055
01:27:23,120 --> 01:27:28,720
seventies station. That was hilarious. Um, but I was hoping they'd have Work Bitch. Cause I just,

1056
01:27:28,720 --> 01:27:33,520
you know, no, I saw, yeah, I saw that advertisement on YouTube the other day. I'm like,

1057
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:38,560
what have you become Brittany? I mean, seriously, it's this whole reinvention of yourself. Call the

1058
01:27:38,560 --> 01:27:45,280
governor. Um, there is actually, there's some good songs like on Radio Mirror Park. They have,

1059
01:27:45,280 --> 01:27:53,600
um, it's all these independent guys, I guess. And they have a, um, a, uh, synth pop track that

1060
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:57,440
actually I put in my car. And it was actually the one that was in the trailer, the latest,

1061
01:27:57,440 --> 01:28:05,520
the last trailer that they did for, um, yeah, for the game they had, uh, on there. And it was, uh,

1062
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:12,960
sleepwalking by the chain gang of 1974. Great, great artists that I discovered through the game,

1063
01:28:12,960 --> 01:28:19,760
you know? And so, I don't know, that's what I like about this game. A perfect example of why

1064
01:28:19,760 --> 01:28:24,000
artists should be, you know, excited to be in a Grand Theft Auto game. And look, I'm not saying

1065
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:28,080
that like, you know, like Rockstar has the right to just use whatever they want and artists should

1066
01:28:28,080 --> 01:28:32,880
just bend over and take it. But I'm just saying like, that's a good sign of like what the benefit

1067
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:37,840
could be, especially for maybe an artist who isn't like AAA or what have you. Um,

1068
01:28:37,840 --> 01:28:42,880
and well, and this show was founded on DDR and I know I found so many artists through DDR,

1069
01:28:42,880 --> 01:28:48,320
especially the Ultra X Games. And if anything, if you happen to not be familiar with the slight

1070
01:28:48,960 --> 01:28:54,160
musical interlude that Eddie Murphy took part in, you get the wonderful track of Party All

1071
01:28:54,160 --> 01:29:00,320
the Time on there, which is fantastic. It's fantastic. So that's worth it right there.

1072
01:29:00,320 --> 01:29:05,280
I used Tim Curry's I Do The Rock last night at Rocky Horror and that was a pretty,

1073
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:10,560
pretty cheesy fucking song too. But yeah, it's pretty awesome when movie celebrities

1074
01:29:10,560 --> 01:29:16,240
have singing careers. And some very exciting news. The guy that does the voice of Franklin,

1075
01:29:16,240 --> 01:29:27,680
Sean Fontenot, he is working on a project with the voice actor from San Andreas who did the voice of

1076
01:29:27,680 --> 01:29:39,760
CJ Young Marley. And basically this came up, I guess, at the New York Comic Con panel. And

1077
01:29:40,640 --> 01:29:44,480
they're asking him questions on it, but he dodged the questions and changed the subject. So

1078
01:29:45,680 --> 01:29:49,520
the thoughts maybe, you know, the thought at least I had from that is,

1079
01:29:50,400 --> 01:29:55,200
ooh, CJ's coming back to San Andreas. That's pretty exciting. Even though they said that

1080
01:29:55,280 --> 01:29:59,440
the whole universe that takes place before 4 doesn't really exist, I still think it's

1081
01:29:59,440 --> 01:30:06,400
really exciting that, you know, CJ may make a return even though he would be like, you know,

1082
01:30:06,400 --> 01:30:12,400
10 years older than actually, I don't know, since I think the game took place in the 90s in San

1083
01:30:12,400 --> 01:30:17,120
Andreas. I haven't really sat down to think about a Grand Theft Auto timeline. But yeah,

1084
01:30:17,120 --> 01:30:23,360
so very exciting. I hope that's some DLC coming because that would be pretty cool.

1085
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:28,320
By the way, Dan showed me something in Grand Theft Auto that actually completely had me in

1086
01:30:28,320 --> 01:30:32,720
stitches. And that's the war vet that hangs out in front of that house by the fence,

1087
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:40,000
who talks all the conspiracy theory stuff. I sat and listened to that for like 30 minutes.

1088
01:30:40,720 --> 01:30:46,960
It was freaking funny and sad and sad. So going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com,

1089
01:30:46,960 --> 01:30:51,120
there's some other chat about great celebrity crossover songs. Dungeon Buster says,

1090
01:30:51,120 --> 01:30:55,840
Don Johnson's heartbeat. Yes. Yeah, they totally like ripped from was it like the

1091
01:30:55,840 --> 01:31:00,400
one hit wonders countdown that they did on like VH1 a while back.

1092
01:31:01,360 --> 01:31:05,760
And then Bobby Black Wolf brought up this truly, truly classic song.

1093
01:31:10,560 --> 01:31:13,360
The Ballad of Bilbo Baggins by Leonard Nimoy.

1094
01:31:14,640 --> 01:31:19,360
This song is so fucking sad. Did you watch that commercial with him and Zachary Quinto?

1095
01:31:20,240 --> 01:31:25,760
Uh, I, I, that sounds familiar. I think they're in each in their own car trying to get to the,

1096
01:31:25,760 --> 01:31:30,960
the play golf. And while he's driving, he's singing the song.

1097
01:31:32,160 --> 01:31:34,800
Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Let's not forget. Shatner had a whole,

1098
01:31:35,680 --> 01:31:39,120
like at least two albums of him singing all of the hits.

1099
01:31:43,040 --> 01:31:48,320
All right. Um, I don't know how to transition from that to this, but I'm going to try anyway.

1100
01:31:49,280 --> 01:31:55,600
Some classic Square Enix properties, uh, going to smartphones and we start off with the news. I

1101
01:31:55,600 --> 01:32:01,760
mean, this is huge news. The Dragon Quest series, uh, all eight games or the first eight,

1102
01:32:01,760 --> 01:32:05,680
cause technically I think there's 10 of them now with the online one. Uh, there are the first

1103
01:32:05,680 --> 01:32:11,680
eight games going to be coming out for iOS and Android. Dragon Quest one will be out this year,

1104
01:32:11,680 --> 01:32:15,440
getting it all started. There's a teaser site out there saying that it will be coming out for iOS

1105
01:32:15,520 --> 01:32:19,680
and Android in Japan, at least in the winter. We don't know how much that will cost,

1106
01:32:19,680 --> 01:32:25,120
but if it's a Square Enix, you can count on a premium. Um, don't know which versions of the

1107
01:32:25,120 --> 01:32:30,960
game either. So, uh, yeah, there you go. Uh, a new Dragon Quest monsters game called Super Light is

1108
01:32:30,960 --> 01:32:36,000
also on the way to iOS and Android. Um, you know, a lot of people remember Dragon Quest here in

1109
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:41,360
America. Of course we got it as Dragon Warrior, but a lot of people remember, uh, speaking of

1110
01:32:41,360 --> 01:32:46,160
magazines, which was kind of the theme of the show earlier. Uh, I remember the Nintendo power,

1111
01:32:46,160 --> 01:32:49,680
you got the Dragon Warrior guide with it, right? Or was that when you bought the game,

1112
01:32:49,680 --> 01:32:53,200
you got it with either the game or you got it with a magazine, probably both. I think it's

1113
01:32:53,200 --> 01:32:56,720
a magazine. Yeah. You got that Dragon Warrior guide. And so I know a lot of people like really

1114
01:32:56,720 --> 01:33:00,320
knew that game. So I think there'll be some people to kind of jump on it when it's re-released

1115
01:33:00,320 --> 01:33:06,240
for, um, iOS later this year. We'll see. But you know, all eight, that's pretty,

1116
01:33:06,240 --> 01:33:09,760
that's pretty crazy. I mean, Dragon Quest eight was a PlayStation two game.

1117
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:13,200
It was really good too. It was one of my favorites in the whole series. Uh,

1118
01:33:13,200 --> 01:33:17,360
speaking of big Square Enix properties going to mobile, I don't know if you guys heard this,

1119
01:33:17,360 --> 01:33:22,640
um, Final Fantasy six confirmed it will be coming to iOS and Android this year.

1120
01:33:22,640 --> 01:33:26,400
And, uh, I seem to remember when Final Fantasy five came out earlier this year,

1121
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:30,880
I remember thinking like, well, this is, this is testing the waters for this, uh,

1122
01:33:30,880 --> 01:33:36,400
Final Fantasy six will be the next big one. And sure enough here it is. So, um, they've said in

1123
01:33:36,400 --> 01:33:40,240
regards to Final Fantasy six, the battle systems have been altered for the other

1124
01:33:40,240 --> 01:33:46,560
mobile remakes and Final Fantasy and Final Fantasy six will be the same. Uh, so yeah,

1125
01:33:46,560 --> 01:33:50,160
I guess on the mobile devices, the battle systems have been adjusted. You won't have to do as much

1126
01:33:50,160 --> 01:33:54,480
grinding and fighting as much. You can just enjoy the game straight up. You won't be able to,

1127
01:33:54,480 --> 01:33:58,880
you won't have to do one, two step, Oh, random battle. Some, some people that's going to rub

1128
01:33:58,880 --> 01:34:04,320
some people the wrong way. I'm very curious to see how Sabin's moves transfer over. Like,

1129
01:34:04,320 --> 01:34:08,320
does that mean you're going to have to just kind of use your finger to draw the different patterns?

1130
01:34:08,320 --> 01:34:11,680
Cause he was the one, like you actually do quarter circle forward to have him do like

1131
01:34:11,680 --> 01:34:15,520
a big fireball and stuff. Remember that Final Fantasy six, like you actually did controller

1132
01:34:15,520 --> 01:34:19,840
movements to get him to do things where you select what it is. Yeah. I don't know. As I'm

1133
01:34:19,840 --> 01:34:25,360
very curious to see how some of that translates over. Um, and also, you know, there was a big

1134
01:34:25,360 --> 01:34:29,920
conversation on this going on on Twitter this week. You know, I talk a lot with like, you know,

1135
01:34:29,920 --> 01:34:34,800
spike from gamebuoy.org on Twitter throughout the week. And he's kind of not happy to hear

1136
01:34:34,800 --> 01:34:40,960
this news because Final Fantasy five, let's just say cut a few corners when it came to like art

1137
01:34:40,960 --> 01:34:46,160
assets, especially. And in my opinion, the game looks very outsourced in some places, you know,

1138
01:34:46,160 --> 01:34:50,880
the art assets aren't, you know, as good as they could be and so on. So there's a little bit of

1139
01:34:50,880 --> 01:34:56,640
concern out there that like, you know, this translation is probably not going to be very good

1140
01:34:56,640 --> 01:35:00,640
and it's definitely going to be just kind of a cash in. Um, I know this is one of my very

1141
01:35:00,640 --> 01:35:05,040
favorites in the entire series. Uh, dark soccer, what do you think about this Final Fantasy six

1142
01:35:05,040 --> 01:35:12,240
coming to iPhone and, uh, Android? I know you, uh, you like this game a lot. Yeah. I love the game,

1143
01:35:12,240 --> 01:35:19,040
but to be honest, I have the cartridge and I have the PlayStation version. So it's sort of like,

1144
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:24,640
I don't need it. It's sometimes it's still fun to see your old games get remade though. I mean,

1145
01:35:24,640 --> 01:35:28,640
when they're good remakes, right? Like a lot of people, I haven't played it yet, but I'm hearing

1146
01:35:28,640 --> 01:35:33,200
Wind Waker. I'm hearing amazing things about that. You know, I'm actually getting more to the point

1147
01:35:33,200 --> 01:35:39,040
where the only thing that I play on my iPhone is freaking bejeweled or puzzle games. And if I'm

1148
01:35:39,040 --> 01:35:44,560
wanting to play a like, and this is quoting fingers, legit game, I'm going to play on my

1149
01:35:44,560 --> 01:35:49,280
three DS or I'm gonna play on my PC. So, well, speaking of three DS, uh, Alan alchemy in our

1150
01:35:49,280 --> 01:35:54,880
chat room says, I want a proper Final Fantasy five and Final Fantasy six DS or three DS remake.

1151
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:59,440
God damn it. None of this iOS HD sprite crap. You know, I think that's where a lot of people

1152
01:35:59,440 --> 01:36:04,480
are at is because you know, the 3d remake of Final Fantasy four and three was, was pretty good. So

1153
01:36:04,480 --> 01:36:13,040
they, we were hoping to get the same treatment. I also, sorry, go ahead. Sorry. Okay, fine. I

1154
01:36:13,040 --> 01:36:20,080
use the power of my boobs to go first. Um, I agree with Agdeft, I and Honda, but I want like a full

1155
01:36:20,080 --> 01:36:24,720
HD version of I Honda and I want them to do a frequent sequel. Well, keep on wishing. I know,

1156
01:36:24,720 --> 01:36:29,680
I know, but I love that game. I would settle for like a Final Fantasy four version where they did

1157
01:36:29,680 --> 01:36:34,480
the after years or whatever, or Final Fantasy six. Oh, that is also coming as Final Fantasy

1158
01:36:34,480 --> 01:36:38,480
four. The after years is also coming to iOS and Android. That was, that was in one of those news

1159
01:36:38,480 --> 01:36:44,240
stories somewhere I would re I'd like Final Fantasy 60 after years or that would be really

1160
01:36:44,240 --> 01:36:49,280
cool to see like a, a sequel to one of the older Final Fantasy games in that way after years wasn't

1161
01:36:49,280 --> 01:36:53,680
terrible, but you know, I think the PSP was probably the best version of that, which so many

1162
01:36:53,680 --> 01:37:00,240
people never even saw it. Yeah. So, all right. Uh, let's move on. Uh, we did the classic game

1163
01:37:00,240 --> 01:37:06,320
of the week. I think we are. It's that time. We've just been talking about some classics like

1164
01:37:07,120 --> 01:37:12,400
dragon quest and final fantasy six and so forth. So dark soccer is going to dive into the gaming

1165
01:37:12,400 --> 01:37:16,640
vault and I think it's a non RPG she picked this week. This one may as well be for Bobby. Like you

1166
01:37:16,640 --> 01:37:21,840
were telling me offline earlier. Yeah. I actually asked dark soccer. I was like, were you picking

1167
01:37:21,840 --> 01:37:26,400
this to troll certain chatters of ours? And she's like, no. And I'm like, but you do realize dot,

1168
01:37:26,400 --> 01:37:31,600
dot, dot. And she's like, Oh yeah. It's like, Oh, Oh, all right. Well enough teasing. What is

1169
01:37:31,600 --> 01:37:37,600
the classic game of the week this week? The classic game of the week is marathon marathon

1170
01:37:37,600 --> 01:37:43,120
was the first person shooter done by bungee and it came out in 1994 for the Macintosh.

1171
01:37:43,120 --> 01:37:46,640
People who say that there's not games for the Mac. Look, there was a game,

1172
01:37:47,200 --> 01:37:56,160
one game. Congrats. You've got that crystal quest. I know. I know. Um, anyway, the, um,

1173
01:37:56,160 --> 01:38:02,640
the game was, um, bungee's second FPS game. The first was pathways into darkness. Um,

1174
01:38:02,640 --> 01:38:09,280
and the game basically was sort of, I wouldn't say biting on doom, but it was seen as, um,

1175
01:38:09,280 --> 01:38:18,800
the Mac counterpart to doom. So, um, and of course this game didn't get a, a PC version until 1995.

1176
01:38:18,800 --> 01:38:24,240
So marathon was very, uh, action oriented, uh, very similar to doom and how it played.

1177
01:38:24,240 --> 01:38:28,480
It had a multiplayer deathmatch mode. You could have up to eight players on separate machines,

1178
01:38:29,440 --> 01:38:36,400
um, on the same land. So it was basically like, we love you Mac players. Here you go.

1179
01:38:37,440 --> 01:38:43,760
And of course it also had sequels. It had marathon two and marathon infinity. Um, and then, um, in

1180
01:38:43,760 --> 01:38:51,040
1996 bungee completed super marathon, which was a marathon marathon two that was on the Bondi Pippin.

1181
01:38:51,360 --> 01:38:55,360
Um, so I'm not going to go into too much about the game itself because

1182
01:38:56,400 --> 01:39:03,520
the story on it is really freaking in depth. I mean, we're talking a super, super rich plot

1183
01:39:04,480 --> 01:39:10,880
and, you know, story twists and a lot of things that I think that sort of become a future nod to,

1184
01:39:10,880 --> 01:39:17,600
um, franchises like Halo, you know, where it's that sci-fi element. You're dealing with outer space.

1185
01:39:18,160 --> 01:39:25,680
You have, uh, AIs going on new issues with AIs and I'm not going to, uh, go too much into that.

1186
01:39:26,720 --> 01:39:34,000
But, um, the important thing that I think about, uh, this one is that the fact that number one,

1187
01:39:34,560 --> 01:39:41,040
yeah, it was on the Mac. I mean, you had very few games, I think, cause this was right when

1188
01:39:41,040 --> 01:39:46,000
the transition, it used to be that, you know, a lot of your, you need to have load runner and

1189
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:50,560
all of your old, uh, Apple IIe games. And you had like the early Mac games, like all your Carmen

1190
01:39:50,560 --> 01:39:56,880
San Diego stuff and different ones. You didn't have like dedicated adult, I'd say adult themed

1191
01:39:56,880 --> 01:40:02,320
games. And this one I thought was supposed to be, uh, pretty, it was pretty big news at the time.

1192
01:40:03,440 --> 01:40:11,200
So it is in a semi 3d rendered world. Um, it's all, you know, texture mapped and dynamic lit

1193
01:40:11,200 --> 01:40:16,400
and everything. Um, it has an option called a free look where you can actually look around the

1194
01:40:16,400 --> 01:40:22,480
character and you can use your mouse to switch weapons. And, uh, it meant that you could look

1195
01:40:22,480 --> 01:40:29,040
down, you could, you know, move around, you could look around corners. Um, and the big thing that

1196
01:40:29,040 --> 01:40:34,720
it was, you know, it was level oriented. Let's kill enemies, avoid obstacles, the usual type of

1197
01:40:34,720 --> 01:40:41,280
FPS stuff. And then, um, to advance to your next level, you had to, uh, find a terminal that your

1198
01:40:41,280 --> 01:40:48,640
AI could teleport you from. So it had different objectives that you had to, um, participate in,

1199
01:40:48,640 --> 01:40:54,320
in the game, including your puzzles. Um, one level didn't have oxygen in it, so you had to complete

1200
01:40:54,320 --> 01:41:00,160
it before asphyxiating. And you had like motion sensors that you'd have to use different weapons.

1201
01:41:00,160 --> 01:41:05,200
Your weapons were, uh, you had to fist a pistol, assault rifle, rocket launcher, a flamethrower

1202
01:41:05,200 --> 01:41:11,600
that wouldn't kill everything, um, a fusion gun, and then you had, uh, this weird alien weapon.

1203
01:41:11,600 --> 01:41:16,000
So that's another thing that came up in Halo, you know, where you could pick up the alien's weapons.

1204
01:41:17,440 --> 01:41:24,240
Um, like I said, also you have a multiplayer version where it was a death match. We had up to

1205
01:41:24,240 --> 01:41:31,120
eight people, um, on a land game. And, uh, it was basically go around, beat each other up until one's

1206
01:41:31,120 --> 01:41:37,760
left. Um, Macworld gave, gave this, uh, game, um, the Game Hall of Fame award for best network game

1207
01:41:37,760 --> 01:41:46,480
of 1995. And, um, Bungie wanted to add more scenarios to it, but did not. They, um, were, uh,

1208
01:41:46,480 --> 01:41:51,920
it looks like they were trying to incorporate them into Marathon too. So, I mean, Marathon is

1209
01:41:51,920 --> 01:41:59,760
basically the big Mac enthusiast game. It started, I think, the realm of serious gaming on Mac.

1210
01:42:00,640 --> 01:42:07,040
You know, for everyone who says, yeah, Macs don't have games, this was, I think, the first attempt to

1211
01:42:07,040 --> 01:42:15,360
really reach out to that market. You know, it ended up being so popular that they did end up

1212
01:42:15,360 --> 01:42:22,480
putting it out on PC later on with a trilogy set. And they even, um, were supporting the Pippin,

1213
01:42:22,480 --> 01:42:28,320
like I said earlier. So, um, that, that YouTube ran out. So I'm going to switch to this, uh, from

1214
01:42:28,320 --> 01:42:37,280
the Xbox 360 remake here real quick. This is from Durin Dow. Well, at any rate, um, there were

1215
01:42:37,280 --> 01:42:44,880
concepts of the, um, AI working that were taken from Marathon that were, as I said, later incorporated

1216
01:42:44,960 --> 01:42:50,720
into the Halo series. And now there is also a version that came out in 2011 that is a port of

1217
01:42:50,720 --> 01:42:57,520
Marathon for the iPad that is, uh, it was released for free. So if you want this and you have an iPad,

1218
01:42:57,520 --> 01:43:04,640
you can definitely go play it. There's also, um, you can get the Aleph 1, um, engine. Um, it's at the

1219
01:43:04,640 --> 01:43:12,480
Marathon open source project. And, uh, there is a, a site called the Trilogy release that has, uh,

1220
01:43:12,480 --> 01:43:21,840
downloadable copies of Marathon and the M1A1. So you can go play it. All right. That's it then,

1221
01:43:21,840 --> 01:43:27,360
your classic end of the week Marathon. Whereas Bobby keeps yelling in chat, Halo Zero,

1222
01:43:27,360 --> 01:43:31,200
which I suppose is one way of looking at it. I mean, in a way without this, you wouldn't have

1223
01:43:31,200 --> 01:43:35,920
Halo. As I think a lot of the inspiration for Halo came to this. So, so Bobby, it's not necessarily

1224
01:43:35,920 --> 01:43:45,920
a troll on my part. It's, it's a, uh, I'd have to say a legitimate, uh, homage to your idea.

1225
01:43:45,920 --> 01:43:49,920
There you go. In other words, that that's, that's the, that's as much as you're gonna get.

1226
01:43:49,920 --> 01:43:51,680
That's as much bungee as you're getting from me.

1227
01:43:52,640 --> 01:43:55,280
There you go. You take what you get and you like it. All right.

1228
01:43:55,280 --> 01:43:56,160
You eat your peas.

1229
01:43:58,080 --> 01:43:59,440
All right. There it is. Your classic end of the week.

1230
01:43:59,440 --> 01:44:01,040
I better not catch you feeding it to the dog.

1231
01:44:01,040 --> 01:44:03,920
I just wanted to say though, when you were talking about like Macintosh games,

1232
01:44:03,920 --> 01:44:08,160
my mind does go to some stuff I was playing like way back in the black and white Macintosh days.

1233
01:44:08,160 --> 01:44:13,520
And, uh, I, I remember crystal quest was a huge one, which they, they did on three 60 later on

1234
01:44:13,520 --> 01:44:16,640
that we should do that as classic game of the week one week. Cause I love that game.

1235
01:44:16,640 --> 01:44:21,680
Uh, and then the other one that my good friend growing up, I had to search for this one. I

1236
01:44:21,680 --> 01:44:27,440
remember it. Dark castle was a great Macintosh game back in the day. If you've never checked

1237
01:44:27,440 --> 01:44:31,040
that out, just, just saying like, I know, I know what you're talking about is you're talking about

1238
01:44:31,040 --> 01:44:36,640
like, you know, a different era of Macintosh sorta, but you know, just right about when

1239
01:44:36,640 --> 01:44:42,240
PC really, really was picking up, you know, when the windows format, cause I think this was right

1240
01:44:42,240 --> 01:44:50,800
around the windows 95 era. So we're looking at the, the big jump from Mac to PC as far as, uh,

1241
01:44:53,280 --> 01:44:59,360
I'd say the everyday user. So Bobby black Wolf in our chat room says I approve of this classic game

1242
01:44:59,360 --> 01:45:04,640
of the week hearts and he is eating his piece. Good, good boy. All right. And you can have a

1243
01:45:04,640 --> 01:45:10,320
fudge pop when you're done. Dungeon Buster in chat, uh, says that, uh, reminds us you can play

1244
01:45:10,320 --> 01:45:16,080
the marathon trilogy on PCs for free. Thanks to bungee. It's at source dot bungee.org. So no

1245
01:45:16,080 --> 01:45:19,680
excuse for you to not check out this game of the week. And I'm going to see if it's actually still

1246
01:45:19,680 --> 01:45:24,640
free on iPad. Nice. All right. There you go. All right. We are definitely running long for this

1247
01:45:24,640 --> 01:45:29,200
first out of the show. So let's take a break guys. When we come back, we will have more orange

1248
01:45:29,200 --> 01:45:33,840
launch radio, rapid fire news, Google question of the week, your emails, phone calls, and plenty

1249
01:45:33,840 --> 01:45:45,120
more. When we come back with more of orange launch radio right after this. Welcome back everybody to

1250
01:45:45,120 --> 01:45:55,520
orange lounge radio episode number 523 already in progress here on October the 13th of 2013. Wow.

1251
01:45:55,520 --> 01:46:00,320
Halloween is sneaking up on us fast. I don't know if you guys have any plans. Uh, Loki is,

1252
01:46:00,320 --> 01:46:04,400
is Josh at about that age where you actually do stuff for Halloween or he still got another year

1253
01:46:04,400 --> 01:46:09,040
or two. Yeah. Usually just around the block. That's a lot of candy you can get for yourself

1254
01:46:09,040 --> 01:46:13,120
to eat, huh? Uh, you know, we give them a little bit of it, but yeah, even last year we ended up

1255
01:46:13,120 --> 01:46:19,520
throwing away most of it. Oh no. Well, it's just like garbage. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, anyway,

1256
01:46:19,520 --> 01:46:24,480
uh, so during the break here, uh, he's going to be a firework. He's going to be a firework for

1257
01:46:24,480 --> 01:46:29,360
Halloween. So what do you want it to be? You want it to be a fireworks. So we're like, okay.

1258
01:46:30,320 --> 01:46:35,920
Becky convinced Julian to dress up as captain Kirk. Oh, that's amazing. He's going to be

1259
01:46:35,920 --> 01:46:39,440
new Kirk or old Kirk. New Kirk. Okay. He's going to be a little heartbreaker.

1260
01:46:40,080 --> 01:46:44,160
That is so funny. That's going to be adorable. Julian's what? Six, seven. Yeah. Last year he

1261
01:46:44,160 --> 01:46:52,080
was iron man. Oh my gosh. All right. Um, one of my friends is, uh, I don't know how much about this.

1262
01:46:52,080 --> 01:46:55,840
I should say on air, but one of my friends is having a party and the whole theme about it is,

1263
01:46:55,840 --> 01:47:01,600
uh, internet memes. So I have to figure out which one I'm going to do. And I'm pretty sure I know,

1264
01:47:01,600 --> 01:47:05,040
but I don't want to say on air cause I know this person listens to the show and I want them to be

1265
01:47:05,040 --> 01:47:08,560
surprised, but uh, yeah, I'm looking, I'm so looking forward to seeing the costumes that come

1266
01:47:08,560 --> 01:47:12,560
out of this. It'll be fun. It's going to be a lot of fun. And the, the, the people that this,

1267
01:47:12,560 --> 01:47:17,680
this party will attract are all very like people that will like be really into it. Like, you know,

1268
01:47:17,680 --> 01:47:23,840
so I'm excited about it. All right. Um, let's see. Uh, I wanted to say during the break there,

1269
01:47:23,840 --> 01:47:28,800
I actually went on to Kickstarter and put my money down for that a retro magazine. So, uh,

1270
01:47:28,800 --> 01:47:33,440
cause if I don't do it now, I'll forget. Cause I forgot for Mighty number nine. I never ended up

1271
01:47:33,440 --> 01:47:37,280
contributing to that. And I forgot for something else too. I was going to download or I was going

1272
01:47:37,280 --> 01:47:40,720
to contribute to recently. I think it was the, I think it was the, um, well, I think it's coming

1273
01:47:40,720 --> 01:47:44,400
up in rapid fire news. Is it, let me, let me peek real quick. Oh yeah. It is coming up. I'll tell

1274
01:47:44,400 --> 01:47:50,240
you in a minute here. Uh, but yeah, uh, so I wanted to tease everybody. I wanted to remember.

1275
01:47:50,240 --> 01:47:54,800
So I did the donation during the break here. So, uh, I hope it gets funded so I can get some

1276
01:47:54,800 --> 01:48:01,840
magazines. We get times. All right. Uh, let's just, I, I, I, I want him to hire me. You should

1277
01:48:01,840 --> 01:48:07,520
write a letter. You never know. So, all right. Um, I saw another podcaster on the list. Act

1278
01:48:07,520 --> 01:48:13,760
deaf. Do you know what? I don't think Rob could be courage wolf. Rob would make a good moon moon.

1279
01:48:14,640 --> 01:48:20,000
What? I don't know what mem you're referencing there. You haven't seen moon moon. It's this

1280
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:26,880
derpy wolf picture. No, no, it's pretty funny. Just look up moon moon. All right. I will. I will.

1281
01:48:26,880 --> 01:48:33,040
All right. Uh, like scumbag Steve. Funny you mentioned that because I told, I told Alan,

1282
01:48:33,040 --> 01:48:36,480
that's what he should be. And he really took offense to that. And I'm, but I'm like, but,

1283
01:48:36,480 --> 01:48:42,240
but like you're tall and like, cause I don't know half of them, half the name,

1284
01:48:42,240 --> 01:48:48,480
name, the names of them out there. Um, but maybe like, was it that guy that's high or whatever

1285
01:48:48,480 --> 01:48:55,200
that comes to the real, you know, the. Epiphany guy. I forget what the Kiana Reeves, not the

1286
01:48:55,200 --> 01:48:59,600
Kiana Reeves guy. There's, there's one. It's like a guy at a concert or like a rave or something

1287
01:48:59,600 --> 01:49:03,520
like that. And he's just kind of standing there like high looking and I don't know.

1288
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:08,720
You need to go to know your mem.com and find it on there. Well, the whole website about it.

1289
01:49:08,720 --> 01:49:12,080
That's the problem is I don't know what it's called. So it'd be kind of hard to look it up.

1290
01:49:13,040 --> 01:49:17,760
Whatever. It's, it's no big deal. All right. Uh, let's move on. Uh, rapid fire news. Uh,

1291
01:49:17,760 --> 01:49:21,840
talk about quickly what's going on in the gaming world. Loki. So the first piece of DLC for saints

1292
01:49:21,840 --> 01:49:31,040
row four comes out on October 22nd, North America, October 23rd in the UK. Um, and it's the answer

1293
01:49:31,040 --> 01:49:37,120
to the dominatrix DLC member eight dominatrix was going to be what saints row four was originally

1294
01:49:37,120 --> 01:49:42,000
their plan on doing this standalone expansion for saints for the third is going to have this,

1295
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:47,440
um, it's basically an alternate storyline to what saints row four is. So includes an alternate

1296
01:49:47,440 --> 01:49:53,440
zen invasion storyline with the saints trapped in a virtual world run by an AI program known as the

1297
01:49:53,440 --> 01:49:59,920
dominatrix. And they have to survive, I guess, against a bunch of sex workers and gimps and stuff

1298
01:49:59,920 --> 01:50:06,400
in the game. So, um, only a game like saints row. Can you be, I guess it's going to have new

1299
01:50:06,400 --> 01:50:12,960
weapons, enemies, allies, and they said missions and a behind the scenes commentary, taking what

1300
01:50:12,960 --> 01:50:19,120
I learned from saints row, the third, and to all those that have saints row four, I caution you

1301
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:24,640
wait until the reviews come out before you decide to buy this DLC, especially if you decide to buy

1302
01:50:24,640 --> 01:50:30,000
a season pass because the season passes for two pieces of DLC. Cause if it's anything that saints

1303
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:35,680
row the third, those pieces of DLC were 30 minutes long and they were crap. You played them once

1304
01:50:35,680 --> 01:50:39,200
there's like four missions and you're done with them and you're just like, why the fuck did I

1305
01:50:39,200 --> 01:50:46,160
just spend money on that? So take the time to read the reviews on the DLC before you purchase it,

1306
01:50:46,160 --> 01:50:51,520
because that's what I'm going to do because I've gotten screwed multiple times by saints row the

1307
01:50:51,520 --> 01:51:00,560
third. So just a fair warning. And yes, it will be, I think $7 for the DLC. Yeah, $7. So cool.

1308
01:51:02,560 --> 01:51:06,720
If you want to get an Xbox 360 and haven't done so yet, there are going to be some

1309
01:51:06,720 --> 01:51:12,000
holiday bundles and then they are launching to believe today. And those holiday bundles are

1310
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:16,800
going to net you not only game systems, but two free games with each one. So for example,

1311
01:51:16,880 --> 01:51:24,800
they have a 200 for $299, a 250 gigabyte system with halo four and tomb Raider,

1312
01:51:24,800 --> 01:51:28,480
a four gigabyte system with connect with connect sports season two and connect vendors. Well,

1313
01:51:28,480 --> 01:51:32,800
that's technically one free game because connect ventures comes with connect, just saying. And

1314
01:51:32,800 --> 01:51:40,720
then of course also a three 99 bundle for 250 gigabyte system with connect and forza horizon,

1315
01:51:40,720 --> 01:51:48,960
as well as connect sports season two. And actually, you know what? I don't even know

1316
01:51:48,960 --> 01:51:55,120
if that's season two and looking at the picture now. I think that might be the connect sports

1317
01:51:55,120 --> 01:52:04,080
season. I think it's both season one and season two. Let me see here real quick. I need to get

1318
01:52:04,080 --> 01:52:08,720
better picture of this. That's not season two. At least that's what it says on a major Nelson site,

1319
01:52:08,720 --> 01:52:13,040
but it doesn't look like the boxer does not look right. I think he's full of shit.

1320
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:19,280
That's just me. Anyways, so yeah, that's going to be coming out. And so look forward to those.

1321
01:52:20,240 --> 01:52:28,160
Also, I guess that is season two. Now that I look at the picture. All right, whatever. Also,

1322
01:52:29,600 --> 01:52:35,200
Ubisoft has revealed the Assassin's Creed four season pass content. And unlike this time around,

1323
01:52:35,200 --> 01:52:42,320
we don't get an evil Washington. Instead, we get freedom cry, a nine mission single player

1324
01:52:42,320 --> 01:52:49,920
campaign starting or starting a new protagonist, Edward Kenway's first mate, let's say aid whale.

1325
01:52:50,560 --> 01:53:01,840
And he is an escaped slave. So that's going to be coming, I guess, 1999 for the season pass.

1326
01:53:01,840 --> 01:53:10,800
Cool. And they have a, an exclusive crack and ship pack. So you can, do you get to

1327
01:53:10,800 --> 01:53:14,560
yell release the cracker? Yes, you do. You get the ring. Yes. You get the yell that, you know,

1328
01:53:15,680 --> 01:53:19,840
that's what it's all about. That's what it's all about. What about the whole fact that the

1329
01:53:19,840 --> 01:53:24,640
Assassin's Creed DLC is not coming to Wii U. What do you think about that? That was like,

1330
01:53:24,640 --> 01:53:28,880
I don't really think anything about it because it doesn't seem like a lot of DLC comes to

1331
01:53:28,880 --> 01:53:34,560
Wii U. What is up with that? Because it's like, okay, because the third money to make it three

1332
01:53:34,560 --> 01:53:38,560
Assassin's Creed three had DLC for it. So I don't understand why it's not coming to

1333
01:53:38,560 --> 01:53:42,240
and like Mass Effect didn't have it and all these other games aren't doing it. And I'm just kind of

1334
01:53:42,240 --> 01:53:46,320
like, the only thing I can think of is that there's some must be some sort of funky

1335
01:53:46,320 --> 01:53:50,800
infrastructure that they have to put in there. Maybe they have to tweak some stuff. It's just

1336
01:53:50,800 --> 01:53:57,040
my, the tinfoil hat guy in me. And, you know, judge me all you want, but I am convinced that

1337
01:53:57,040 --> 01:54:02,400
there is something in Nintendo's online infrastructure that is not conducive to the

1338
01:54:02,400 --> 01:54:08,400
DLC thing like Sony and Microsoft. I don't know what it is. Maybe it's the cut that they take

1339
01:54:08,400 --> 01:54:14,560
or something, or maybe it's like, you know, well, I would think even if the cut wasn't that good,

1340
01:54:14,560 --> 01:54:18,640
it's still thinking you would want to do that. Maybe it's some sort of exclusive, I don't know,

1341
01:54:18,640 --> 01:54:22,560
I don't know what it is, but yeah, I know a lot of games come out for the Wii U and they don't

1342
01:54:22,560 --> 01:54:26,320
have DLC packed in there. I don't think it's the cut or anything, or it wouldn't be so appealing

1343
01:54:26,320 --> 01:54:28,960
to indie developers, though. Like, I almost wonder if it's something about the process.

1344
01:54:28,960 --> 01:54:31,920
But indie developers don't do DLC for their games, usually.

1345
01:54:31,920 --> 01:54:37,520
True, true. Alright, anyhow, so the tinfoil speculation continues all around the internet.

1346
01:54:37,520 --> 01:54:42,320
Meanwhile, a game that's coming out for the Xbox One that some people are looking forward to,

1347
01:54:42,320 --> 01:54:47,920
Killer Instinct. Killer Instinct will be doing their balance updates on the fly. In other words,

1348
01:54:47,920 --> 01:54:51,200
they're talking about, they're talking about doing the cloud. They're talking about their updating

1349
01:54:51,200 --> 01:54:54,720
immediately through the cloud, and all the variables that talk about how a character

1350
01:54:54,720 --> 01:54:58,720
behaves are going to exist in the cloud, and this is according to producer Torin Rettig,

1351
01:54:58,720 --> 01:55:03,360
talking to Game Informer. Without having to content update or patch the game at all,

1352
01:55:03,360 --> 01:55:07,440
we can just go in on the cloud and tweak these variables without the player having to know.

1353
01:55:07,440 --> 01:55:11,520
Our vision is for it all to be behind the scenes, so it won't require any official title update

1354
01:55:11,520 --> 01:55:15,040
download. Basically, the game checks for the latest version of the gameplay's parameters

1355
01:55:15,040 --> 01:55:19,600
and automatically updates if it's a new version. No download or confirmation dialogue necessary,

1356
01:55:19,600 --> 01:55:24,080
and the files themselves are so small, you'll never notice the difference. So what I'm hearing

1357
01:55:24,080 --> 01:55:29,760
is that it is patching. They're just really small files, so like they're patches, but they're not

1358
01:55:29,760 --> 01:55:34,480
like PlayStation patches that take like an hour, you know? That's fine if they're doing that,

1359
01:55:34,480 --> 01:55:38,960
and they did that even with like some Xbox games got around that where they could tweak stuff.

1360
01:55:38,960 --> 01:55:44,720
I remember one of the games we actually talked to people or talked to a developer at E3 about was

1361
01:55:44,720 --> 01:55:51,040
that Madballs Babbo Invasion game, remember that? And they were talking about how they could tweak

1362
01:55:51,040 --> 01:55:56,480
everything via, you know, just basically having the game be online, they can tweak all the

1363
01:55:56,480 --> 01:56:01,840
variables. I get the idea about tweaking things like in the cloud, so to speak, like a lot of MMOs

1364
01:56:01,840 --> 01:56:05,680
do this all the time. We call them hot fixes in World of Warcraft and so forth, but when I hear

1365
01:56:05,680 --> 01:56:10,080
like, well, it's tweaked in the cloud, but then there actually are small patches, but it's done

1366
01:56:10,080 --> 01:56:14,960
in the cloud. I'm like, you use that word cloud, and I don't think it means what you think it means.

1367
01:56:14,960 --> 01:56:18,720
You don't think you know what it means. I don't think it means what you think it means. Anyway.

1368
01:56:18,720 --> 01:56:23,120
Just call it the internet. It's the fucking internet. It's not a cloud. It's the internet.

1369
01:56:23,120 --> 01:56:33,120
The internet is infrastructure. It's not the cloud because then you get people making ridiculous

1370
01:56:33,120 --> 01:56:36,880
like comparisons to clouds. Like, oh, it's raining. It's stormy in the cloud.

1371
01:56:37,520 --> 01:56:42,000
All right. Here's the other Kickstarter I teased earlier that I forgot to back and the deadline

1372
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:47,920
has passed. It's River City Ransom Underground. River City Ransom Underground did make its funding

1373
01:56:47,920 --> 01:56:53,920
this week. They raised 180,000 Canadian dollars and that will ensure that they will be able to

1374
01:56:53,920 --> 01:57:00,400
get the game onto the PC. So yeah, there it goes. So congratulations to them. Look forward to being

1375
01:57:00,400 --> 01:57:06,320
able to play the game. And lastly, here's the game I am very excited about on the 3DS. I am

1376
01:57:06,320 --> 01:57:10,560
more excited about this game than Pokemon. Sorry about it, but this is far more important than

1377
01:57:10,560 --> 01:57:16,080
Pokemon X and Y. I don't care if you're going to judge me for that because this is Zelda,

1378
01:57:16,080 --> 01:57:21,040
A Link Between Worlds. I am very excited about this. There was a new trailer shown this week

1379
01:57:21,040 --> 01:57:26,800
that actually shows that some of the ways that you have, or you have that link between worlds,

1380
01:57:26,800 --> 01:57:31,440
because obviously in the teaser logo, you have like the light Triforce and the dark Triforce.

1381
01:57:31,440 --> 01:57:35,520
Well, in this new teaser, you see Link literally slipping through cracks. Cause you know,

1382
01:57:35,520 --> 01:57:39,760
it's that whole thing where he can kind of put, press himself up against a wall like paper.

1383
01:57:39,760 --> 01:57:45,680
And he goes from high rule to low rule is the name of the other world. It seems like, get it

1384
01:57:45,680 --> 01:57:52,320
high, low, ah, her anyhow, whatever, uh, as long as the game's good, I don't care what they call

1385
01:57:52,320 --> 01:57:57,600
the world. Uh, so there it is. And uh, I guess there is a new villain in the game too, but I

1386
01:57:57,600 --> 01:58:02,320
kind of go, sure. There's a new villain. Sure. It's a new villain. It'll fucking be Ganon

1387
01:58:03,840 --> 01:58:08,000
somehow or something controlled by Ganon or whatever. But anyhow, the release date of the

1388
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:14,000
game, November 22nd, man, that makes me want to bust out my link to the past cartridge, right?

1389
01:58:14,720 --> 01:58:19,280
I know just because I love, I love the last battle in that game. Yeah. I just love that

1390
01:58:19,280 --> 01:58:22,720
ending. That's like, I haven't played through that game in a very long time.

1391
01:58:25,120 --> 01:58:30,720
A little bit. So anyway, uh, dark soccer, what do you have? I don't know. And we're not even

1392
01:58:30,720 --> 01:58:37,520
talking about that in the chat room. We're talking about, uh, Strider, whatever Strider.

1393
01:58:37,520 --> 01:58:42,720
Yo, it's always about other topics than what we're actually talking about on here. Strider.

1394
01:58:42,720 --> 01:58:48,720
Okay. So, um, the Double Fine is going to be hosting the day of the devs on November 2nd.

1395
01:58:49,360 --> 01:58:55,440
Um, it is with the help of I am 8-bit. It is free to the public and it's an event that will let

1396
01:58:55,440 --> 01:59:01,360
the public basically meet the folks at Double Fine and, um, some other indie developers and

1397
01:59:01,360 --> 01:59:07,120
let them check out some of the Kickstarter, uh, games like, uh, Broken Age and another

1398
01:59:07,200 --> 01:59:13,440
untitled, uh, game. And so it's basically just hang out with us, play some games. We're cool

1399
01:59:13,440 --> 01:59:21,760
people. You like us. So hurry for Double Fine. And then, um, Ed Boon, who, um, developed Injustice

1400
01:59:21,760 --> 01:59:27,360
and he was our Mortal Kombat dude, he basically said on Twitter that he wanted to create a Mortal

1401
01:59:27,360 --> 01:59:32,080
Kombat versus Street Fighter, um, and that he's reached out to Capcom to see if they would be

1402
01:59:32,080 --> 01:59:36,480
interested, but they have not replied yet. I don't know that that would be something that

1403
01:59:37,600 --> 01:59:40,800
Capcom would go for. They would do it because, I mean, if they do it, they're the same route as

1404
01:59:40,800 --> 01:59:45,280
they did like with Injustice, well not Injustice, but like, Mortal Kombat versus DC where it's kind

1405
01:59:45,280 --> 01:59:49,760
of pussified where they just, you know, make it teen rated and not so violent, then they could

1406
01:59:49,760 --> 01:59:53,840
probably get away with it because I think the whole thing was, well, we don't want to have,

1407
01:59:53,840 --> 01:59:58,480
you know, these guys doing fatalities on, you know, Street Fighter characters or even I think

1408
01:59:58,480 --> 02:00:02,240
DC does the same thing. We don't want, we don't want Scorpion ripping the head off of Superman

1409
02:00:03,120 --> 02:00:10,560
because that's just not realistic. I still thought it was funny that they put in the original Joker

1410
02:00:10,560 --> 02:00:16,080
fatality later on, the full thing. Yeah. That was pretty cool. So, um, and then something that a

1411
02:00:16,080 --> 02:00:21,840
lot of people are excited for is that the Final Fantasy X and X-2 HD remasters are going to be

1412
02:00:21,840 --> 02:00:30,640
out in Japan in December. They will be out for a Vita and PS3 and the date for release is December

1413
02:00:30,640 --> 02:00:35,520
26th. So I'm hoping that we're going to get it soon after over here in the US.

1414
02:00:37,120 --> 02:00:42,640
Yay. Yay. There was much rejoicing. That's the only upcoming game that I had tentative for this year

1415
02:00:42,640 --> 02:00:48,560
that I still don't know what the date is. I keep asking too. Yeah. I would assume it'd have to be,

1416
02:00:48,560 --> 02:00:54,400
assuming they're localizing it around the same time as the current development,

1417
02:00:54,400 --> 02:01:02,960
then I would assume sometime in January, February. Alrighty. I, yeah, I really want,

1418
02:01:02,960 --> 02:01:06,720
I'm really looking forward to those games, but I'm okay if it takes until after the holidays to

1419
02:01:06,720 --> 02:01:11,120
finish it. Cause I still didn't even play through Kingdom Hearts. Final Fantasy XIV derailed all

1420
02:01:11,120 --> 02:01:16,080
my gaming stuff. Like I got to get back on board with the other stuff. Rob, you still have to play

1421
02:01:16,080 --> 02:01:22,400
XIV with me. Make me. No, I'm just kidding. Alan can run dungeons now too. So I'm trying to get

1422
02:01:22,400 --> 02:01:25,360
him up to speed and then maybe we can all do stuff. I'll make you a sandwich if you play.

1423
02:01:25,360 --> 02:01:29,440
Cool. I love sandwiches. But not right now. Alright. Let's get to the FUGL question of the

1424
02:01:29,440 --> 02:01:41,600
week you guys. Every week we ask a question of our Facebook and our Google Plus communities.

1425
02:01:41,600 --> 02:01:45,920
You take those words and throw them together and you get FUGL. So it's time for the FUGL

1426
02:01:45,920 --> 02:01:50,800
question of the week. And that question is knowing the interview we had earlier tonight,

1427
02:01:50,800 --> 02:01:54,960
we kind of stuck with the theme here. And the question is, do you currently, or have you in

1428
02:01:54,960 --> 02:02:00,240
the past subscribed to any video game magazines? Which ones? Do you have a particularly favorite

1429
02:02:00,240 --> 02:02:05,440
issue? And, uh, yeah, so we got a lot of responses to this. I don't have time to read all these

1430
02:02:05,440 --> 02:02:09,120
answers. I'm very sorry. So I'm going to really encourage you to go to our Facebook community

1431
02:02:09,120 --> 02:02:13,600
at facebook.com slash orange launch radio and our Google Plus community to check out the answers.

1432
02:02:13,600 --> 02:02:17,280
I'm going to try to read some of these and I'm going to try to pick names I don't see

1433
02:02:17,280 --> 02:02:21,440
very often. Just, just to cycle through some different voices. I don't always see in chat

1434
02:02:21,440 --> 02:02:26,720
or other places. Um, so starting with gaming nerd on Facebook says I used to be a subscriber

1435
02:02:26,720 --> 02:02:32,400
to a number of magazines, including game pro EGM, Sega visions, game players, and game informer.

1436
02:02:32,400 --> 02:02:36,560
I forgot about Sega visions, but yeah, that was a cool magazine. Um, I still have all of the

1437
02:02:36,560 --> 02:02:42,720
issues collected in bins to take out and flip through whenever I feel a nostalgic rush. Um,

1438
02:02:42,720 --> 02:02:48,480
let's see. Unfolded Raptor says I subscribed to Nintendo power and electronic gaming monthly

1439
02:02:48,480 --> 02:02:53,360
and have kept every issue, but the story behind behind my favorite issue is interesting.

1440
02:02:53,360 --> 02:02:59,360
In October, 2004 issue 183 of EGM, they interviewed a girl by the name of Rachel Moore,

1441
02:02:59,360 --> 02:03:03,920
who is talking about horror games and wearing a Tony Hawk's underground shirt. About 2006,

1442
02:03:03,920 --> 02:03:09,120
I discovered orange on radio randomly and started listening to you on my PSP. This got my interest

1443
02:03:09,200 --> 02:03:13,200
started in gaming podcast. And eventually I wound up on all games.com, which is, you know,

1444
02:03:13,200 --> 02:03:18,080
where we were previously, uh, and listen to both OLR and all games interactive then moved to dead

1445
02:03:18,080 --> 02:03:22,320
pixel and spooky hour horror hour where Rachel Moore was a host. I didn't think much of it at

1446
02:03:22,320 --> 02:03:25,920
the time, and I didn't put it all together until I was looking back at my old gaming magazines and

1447
02:03:25,920 --> 02:03:30,080
had a holy shit moment because this girl I was listening to was way bigger than I thought. And

1448
02:03:30,080 --> 02:03:35,440
I knew her before, even if I didn't realize it now it's kept in a safe place. Then imagine my shock

1449
02:03:35,440 --> 02:03:39,920
when I heard OLR was moving to all games.com. It was amazing. And now we have VOG, but I love

1450
02:03:39,920 --> 02:03:43,840
how everything worked together and everything was so connected. Life can be funny sometimes.

1451
02:03:43,840 --> 02:03:47,920
That's very true. It's you never know where the people you might've seen in one place are going

1452
02:03:47,920 --> 02:03:53,280
to end up. That's just, that's just true anywhere, you know, in, in anything, any industry, not just

1453
02:03:53,280 --> 02:04:00,800
gaming. Um, Elliot B says I had a subscription to edge magazine for over a decade now, and it's

1454
02:04:00,800 --> 02:04:04,880
still very much worth reading. Always has interesting features and stunning design,

1455
02:04:04,880 --> 02:04:09,440
especially the gorgeous glossy covers. Though I sometimes miss the days when it was pretentious

1456
02:04:09,440 --> 02:04:15,040
enough to refer to itself in third person. Uh, Amanda R replies and says, I subscribed to

1457
02:04:15,040 --> 02:04:19,920
Nintendo power back in the day. It was really a great magazine. When Pokemon red and blue came

1458
02:04:19,920 --> 02:04:25,280
out in the States, they had little tear out comic book size guides in every issue, uh, were

1459
02:04:25,280 --> 02:04:29,520
incredibly helpful. And even before the game came out, they got us really hyped to play it. Yeah,

1460
02:04:29,520 --> 02:04:34,080
we brought up the dragon warrior one too. And that, you know, that final fantasy,

1461
02:04:34,080 --> 02:04:37,920
what else did they have? Those big strategy guides earthbound had a big one. You know,

1462
02:04:37,920 --> 02:04:42,720
those all really got people hyped for those games. Uh, this was before the internet was really a

1463
02:04:42,720 --> 02:04:46,800
thing and I'm not sure if there was a strategy guide out there. So the little guides were

1464
02:04:46,800 --> 02:04:52,400
gold. Uh, James A replies and says, I have subscribed to game informer and Nintendo power.

1465
02:04:52,400 --> 02:04:57,920
My favorite issue would have to be Nintendo power one 72 because they featured some envelope art

1466
02:04:57,920 --> 02:05:04,000
that I submitted. It was the happiest moment of my young life. And lastly, we'll read an answer

1467
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:09,280
here from Veronica S who says, I used to subscribe to Nintendo power back in the game cube days,

1468
02:05:09,280 --> 02:05:15,360
but I got tired of reading it. So I unsubscribed. Now I subscribe to Nintendo force, the all new

1469
02:05:15,360 --> 02:05:21,440
spiritual successor to Nintendo power. Thank you guys for the answers. There were so many answers,

1470
02:05:21,440 --> 02:05:25,920
um, that I just, you know, we were running a little long tonight because of, uh, we had a

1471
02:05:25,920 --> 02:05:30,640
longer part eight and I than usual. So I don't have time to read all 20 plus responses on

1472
02:05:30,640 --> 02:05:35,600
Facebook and then Google. So, uh, please check out what our listeners had to say. A lot of love

1473
02:05:35,600 --> 02:05:39,680
for Nintendo power across the board. I noticed, which, um, you know, doesn't, doesn't surprise me

1474
02:05:39,680 --> 02:05:44,160
one bit. That's certainly one that's near and dear to my heart. You know, I got, I got in trouble

1475
02:05:44,160 --> 02:05:47,920
when I was in fourth grade over an issue of Nintendo power. Yeah. Cause I had it out in

1476
02:05:47,920 --> 02:05:52,560
class and I was showing friends. It was, it was the controversial issue, uh, with Simon's quest

1477
02:05:52,560 --> 02:05:55,920
on the cover. It was only like issue four or something, but you know, like parents were very

1478
02:05:55,920 --> 02:06:01,680
upset that there was like skulls and, and, and imagery on the cover of the magazine like this.

1479
02:06:01,680 --> 02:06:07,680
And I had one of the big guides for, um, Mario paint. Oh yeah. I remember that one. You had the,

1480
02:06:07,680 --> 02:06:12,960
it had the songs in it. You could put in the songs. They had a bunch of, uh, bitmap or,

1481
02:06:12,960 --> 02:06:18,480
you know, bitmap stuff for like all the different characters. And it was pretty cool for the record.

1482
02:06:18,480 --> 02:06:24,000
There was a magazine that I was super into that had a short run, but it was gorgeous in its

1483
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:29,200
production value and their designers were freaking brilliant. Um, do you remember play?

1484
02:06:30,160 --> 02:06:34,640
Uh, I think I still see that magazine in places. Yeah. I know that. I don't know if it's,

1485
02:06:34,640 --> 02:06:38,800
I don't know if it's still in, well, not like new, but like collectors things, but, um,

1486
02:06:39,520 --> 02:06:45,920
they had gorgeous spreads. I mean, the design in that magazine was so top notch. That's really,

1487
02:06:45,920 --> 02:06:51,760
um, one of, uh, I've actually used examples from that magazine in some of my own layouts,

1488
02:06:52,560 --> 02:06:57,520
borrowed ideas from it because it was such a group and it was very well written on top of that.

1489
02:06:59,040 --> 02:07:01,760
Alrighty. Well, let's move on with some more news stories. Loki.

1490
02:07:02,480 --> 02:07:08,560
All right. Um, so let's talk a little bit about, um, a follow-up kind of what we talked about last

1491
02:07:08,560 --> 02:07:14,000
week with the whole Neo Geo X plug and play thing. Um, you remember we were talking that they were

1492
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:22,080
basically ending their contract with Tomo and Tomo wouldn't be able to create these, um, Neo Geo X

1493
02:07:22,080 --> 02:07:26,640
portable systems and the dock and stuff that actually looks like the Neo Geo system and the

1494
02:07:26,640 --> 02:07:31,360
controller and all that. Well, Tomo denies that there was any sort of breach of contract at all.

1495
02:07:31,360 --> 02:07:37,440
And actually they're just going to continue selling the Neo Geo X anyways. And apparently there's

1496
02:07:37,440 --> 02:07:44,240
been some comments, I guess, from people that had other agreements with SNK previously saying that,

1497
02:07:44,240 --> 02:07:50,400
you know, they've retracted, I guess, um, or they they've tried to pull this kind of thing with

1498
02:07:50,400 --> 02:07:55,120
other companies with licensing, but it says they're licensed. They recently extended their

1499
02:07:55,120 --> 02:08:01,040
licensing agreement through, uh, 2016 and that they're going to basically keep, you know,

1500
02:08:01,040 --> 02:08:07,600
publishing that stuff or making those things until their contract runs up, despite what,

1501
02:08:07,600 --> 02:08:13,680
you know, SNK is saying, because I guess there would be a breach of contract. Um,

1502
02:08:14,960 --> 02:08:17,520
this is kind of interesting. And so they're saying that, you know,

1503
02:08:19,040 --> 02:08:24,480
basically they're still taking care of, I guess, all the warranties of, um, those systems as we're

1504
02:08:24,480 --> 02:08:30,000
continuing to sell Neo Geo X products, including Neo Geo X gold system, arcade sick, mega pack,

1505
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:34,480
classic volumes, one through five, it says the license agreement, which allows Tomo to sell

1506
02:08:34,480 --> 02:08:42,640
and market these products remains in effect. So that's kind of interesting. So yeah, I like that.

1507
02:08:42,640 --> 02:08:46,720
They're not going out without a fight. This is pretty cool. Well, I mean, if they've got a

1508
02:08:46,720 --> 02:08:50,080
contract that they signed and then all of a sudden, you know, SNK saying, well, no,

1509
02:08:50,080 --> 02:08:54,800
we don't want to do that anymore. And unless they have like a legal out in that contract,

1510
02:08:55,360 --> 02:09:00,880
I don't see how they can just say, no, we're not going to off, you know, we're not going to,

1511
02:09:00,880 --> 02:09:05,760
you know, follow through that contract. Right. Right. I mean, come on. I don't know why they

1512
02:09:05,760 --> 02:09:10,160
would do that in the first place where they don't want the Neo Geo being out there. I don't know

1513
02:09:10,160 --> 02:09:16,480
what their plan is. All right. Guess we'll see how this plays out. Yeah. And maybe your chance

1514
02:09:16,480 --> 02:09:21,840
isn't up to get one of these systems after all. All right. Well, uh, anyhow, uh, dark soccer,

1515
02:09:21,840 --> 02:09:26,320
I know you like the Coleco vision. So I'm sure this news has you either very excited or very

1516
02:09:26,320 --> 02:09:32,080
scared. Um, there's going to be an iOS app that is going to, uh, invoke the Coleco vision through,

1517
02:09:32,080 --> 02:09:37,360
uh, you know, emulation and all that. Um, it, uh, was on Kickstarter, I guess at one point,

1518
02:09:37,360 --> 02:09:42,400
uh, Oh no, it is, is right now actually, uh, trying to seek. I thought that this was already

1519
02:09:42,400 --> 02:09:46,480
funded, but I guess not. They, they were doing this whole little countdown thing and I thought,

1520
02:09:46,480 --> 02:09:50,240
Oh, they're going to unveil the app. Well, I guess they unveiled the, um, Kickstarter, but,

1521
02:09:50,240 --> 02:09:56,080
uh, it's rant media games who did the original vet treks regeneration, which was, it's a pretty

1522
02:09:56,080 --> 02:09:59,360
good little app. If you played it, they're trying to get a quarter million dollars through

1523
02:09:59,360 --> 02:10:04,640
Kickstarter by November 8th to fund this iOS app. Uh, they're also targeting Android, PC,

1524
02:10:04,640 --> 02:10:09,280
Mac, and even possibly things like the Vita. I imagine that's like stretch goals or whatever.

1525
02:10:09,280 --> 02:10:14,160
Um, they're hoping to have a living room menu in the app and allow you to kind of swipe across the

1526
02:10:14,160 --> 02:10:18,720
stream to get games, check out the box art, check out the cartridge. The vet treks one is pretty

1527
02:10:18,720 --> 02:10:24,560
cool. If you haven't already played it, they do have the rights to 19 different games and sorry,

1528
02:10:24,560 --> 02:10:28,960
Casey Munchkin is not Munchkin is not one of them. Well, Casey Munchkin wasn't on the Cliccovision.

1529
02:10:28,960 --> 02:10:33,040
Wasn't, I thought that was the Cliccovision. That was the Magnavox Odyssey too. I don't know.

1530
02:10:33,040 --> 02:10:38,000
Son of a bitch. Like all the different, uh, all the games that they have lists on here.

1531
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:43,520
I'm quite excited for actually now that I look at the list. Space Fury. I had an Atari 2600,

1532
02:10:43,520 --> 02:10:47,280
so all those other systems kind of blurred together for me. Space Fury is one of my favorite

1533
02:10:47,280 --> 02:10:51,520
Cliccovision games. Well, there are some pretty good ones that I even noticed here like Bump and

1534
02:10:51,520 --> 02:10:56,240
Jump. I remember that Jumpman and Jumpman Jr. certainly remember from the 64 Montezuma's Revenge.

1535
02:10:56,240 --> 02:11:02,320
Oh my God. That was a huge game. Uh, Zaxxon. What's the one you're looking at, Logie? Well,

1536
02:11:02,320 --> 02:11:07,920
I used to play a ton of Bump and Jump and actually a ton of Jumpman Jr. Frenzy, Space Fury and Zaxxon.

1537
02:11:07,920 --> 02:11:11,760
I think I've planned Pepper too. I think I've actually played most of these games except for

1538
02:11:11,760 --> 02:11:15,120
Antarctic adventure. I don't recognize that or destructive. There are two games that I would

1539
02:11:15,120 --> 02:11:22,000
want to be on that list and one of them would be Venture and the other one, um, would be, uh, Gorf.

1540
02:11:23,280 --> 02:11:27,760
I would, I would put money into it if they had Gorf. And I love, I love the little, like,

1541
02:11:27,760 --> 02:11:31,840
the boxing. They have a, you know, a bunch of different animated banners and stuff. And for

1542
02:11:31,840 --> 02:11:37,840
platforms, they have the, uh, Rocky IV game on there, which is awesome. They have a special

1543
02:11:37,840 --> 02:11:43,440
controller for it and everything. All right. So, um, they're looking for a quarter million

1544
02:11:43,440 --> 02:11:48,720
dollars on Kickstarter. They've got 5,000 after the first five days, which is supposed to be,

1545
02:11:48,720 --> 02:11:52,960
like, kind of like the biggest push. I don't know. I'm going to be just completely honest.

1546
02:11:52,960 --> 02:11:57,520
I think a quarter million is too much money for a project like this. And I understand they justify

1547
02:11:57,520 --> 02:12:03,280
it. And I, you know, I, it's not that I'm thinking like, oh, you know, they're not like, they're

1548
02:12:03,280 --> 02:12:06,880
asking for too much money and we don't really know where it's going. I get it. They got to get

1549
02:12:06,880 --> 02:12:10,800
the licensing and all this stuff. And that's where a bunch of it is, is going so that the whole

1550
02:12:10,800 --> 02:12:15,680
thing's legal and all that. But I just think at the end of the day, you're going to ask for a

1551
02:12:15,680 --> 02:12:21,600
quarter million dollars for an iOS app of a system that is so old. And I just, I don't think there's

1552
02:12:21,600 --> 02:12:25,520
going to be enough people that are interested. I'm sorry. Like, I know that sounds really cruel, but

1553
02:12:25,520 --> 02:12:30,320
especially when we were talking about a lot of retro love earlier, but that's, yeah, I don't

1554
02:12:30,320 --> 02:12:33,760
think they're going to hit it. If they do great, more power to them. And I would love to check out

1555
02:12:33,760 --> 02:12:39,680
the game when it comes out. Uh, but I don't know. It's a lot of money to try and get off Kickstarter.

1556
02:12:40,960 --> 02:12:44,240
What do you guys think? Do you think I'm right? Do you think I'm being cruel? I don't think that

1557
02:12:44,240 --> 02:12:50,720
they're going to hit it, but I wish they'd hit it if they had Gorf adventure. The, my thing though,

1558
02:12:50,720 --> 02:12:56,480
is seriously is how these games can, I mean, cause they have a num pad on that thing. And then

1559
02:12:56,480 --> 02:13:01,440
the joystick was really weird. So it'd be interesting to see how this is going to translate

1560
02:13:01,440 --> 02:13:08,400
over to the actual way to plane. And that's why every time I get excited about a retro game

1561
02:13:08,400 --> 02:13:13,520
collection on iPad, I walk away really disappointed because the touch controls just

1562
02:13:13,520 --> 02:13:18,960
suck. Now, ever since I got the, I cayed, that's improved things significantly. The vector X game

1563
02:13:18,960 --> 02:13:23,760
thing I think works pretty good. The I K right. And I K it's great with some of the other apps,

1564
02:13:23,760 --> 02:13:29,280
like the, uh, uh, ARCA got midway arcade or whatever it's called that's on there. Uh,

1565
02:13:29,280 --> 02:13:34,000
it works great, but the reality is I can't haul that thing like into bed when I'm about ready to

1566
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:37,280
go to, you know, I lie down there for, you know, a few minutes before I go to bed and play something

1567
02:13:37,280 --> 02:13:40,800
on my iPad or something. Can't really do that with the I K and the touch controls just kind of

1568
02:13:40,800 --> 02:13:45,760
blow. So every time I get excited about one of these retro remakes, I actually play it. And then

1569
02:13:45,760 --> 02:13:51,440
I'm like, eh, I missed the real thing. So, all right. Anyhow, sorry to be Debbie downer, dark

1570
02:13:51,440 --> 02:14:01,040
soccer. What do you got? Uh, some stuff. Well, um, the God damn stupid iPad. I will get frustrated

1571
02:14:01,040 --> 02:14:06,000
by the touch controls too. You know what? I think this thing is touched in the head. So

1572
02:14:07,680 --> 02:14:16,320
THQ is suing EA and Zufa. Um, and what they are suing about this time is, um, is everybody's

1573
02:14:16,320 --> 02:14:24,000
fucking suing everybody. Um, they're suing about the, um, UFC game. Uh, basically EA was going to

1574
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:31,280
be releasing the, um, EA sports UFC in 2014. And, um, because they gained the license for that in

1575
02:14:31,280 --> 02:14:40,240
June, 2012, which was six months before THQ did. And so, um, since basically THQ was bankrupt,

1576
02:14:40,880 --> 02:14:47,280
um, Zufa paid, uh, looks like, uh, 10 million for breaking the contract. Um,

1577
02:14:49,120 --> 02:14:56,160
and THQ says that, no, we were supposed to receive double that. So yeah, it's money. We want,

1578
02:14:56,160 --> 02:14:59,600
we're bankrupt. We need the money. We need to pay back our attorney fees, that type of thing. So

1579
02:14:59,600 --> 02:15:06,240
I think for what it was is I think that basically EA, uh, had insider information regarding THQ's

1580
02:15:06,240 --> 02:15:15,040
financial standing and they let the company, they let the, uh, other company know about that and

1581
02:15:15,040 --> 02:15:23,200
were able to negotiate a better deal because of that. And so they're off that insider information

1582
02:15:23,200 --> 02:15:30,320
was leaked out about, you know, THQ. It is kind of funny to see, you know, THQ suing

1583
02:15:31,840 --> 02:15:38,160
anybody because they've kind of dissolved anyways. Who is THQ anymore? It's kind of interesting.

1584
02:15:38,160 --> 02:15:43,920
One dude at a desk. I am THQ. It's more like their lawyer. I am Spartacus.

1585
02:15:44,640 --> 02:15:49,280
Get off my lawn and give me another $10 million. Yeah, seriously. It's whatever

1586
02:15:49,360 --> 02:15:57,200
lawyer now represents him. Seriously. So yeah. All right, let's move on. Loki. All right. Um,

1587
02:15:58,320 --> 02:16:02,480
so since we've been talking a little bit about crowdfunding, this is kind of interesting.

1588
02:16:03,040 --> 02:16:10,560
Square Enix has this new partnership with Indiegogo. It's called the collective.

1589
02:16:10,560 --> 02:16:19,680
And what it is is basically this Indiegogo curated page, um, that's going to allow people

1590
02:16:19,680 --> 02:16:27,680
to vote over the course of 28 days. And, um, they're on different like product, uh, project

1591
02:16:27,680 --> 02:16:36,880
pitches, including, um, rebooting an old franchise from Eidos. So, uh, I don't know. That sounds

1592
02:16:36,880 --> 02:16:41,200
interesting, I guess, but it's kind of weird though that we have to go to crowdfunding to

1593
02:16:41,200 --> 02:16:48,400
do that sort of thing, but whatever. Um, so basically, you know, you can pitch your ideas

1594
02:16:48,400 --> 02:16:53,600
to developers and if people like those ideas, they may run with it. You know, whenever I see

1595
02:16:53,600 --> 02:16:58,880
something like this, it's kind of like, yeah, we've run out of ideas. Why don't you guys give

1596
02:16:58,880 --> 02:17:04,800
us ideas and we'll make money off of them. Um, you know, and the way they pitch it, oh, well,

1597
02:17:04,800 --> 02:17:10,080
you can shape the development of the game and, and, you know, get these ideas out there and

1598
02:17:10,080 --> 02:17:16,880
we'll run with them and blah, blah, blah. And I'm assuming since it's, you know, partnered with

1599
02:17:16,880 --> 02:17:22,080
Indiegogo, does that mean we have to fund it too? You know, we're going to have to fund this game

1600
02:17:22,080 --> 02:17:28,000
that you're going to make money off of. It's a little weird. You're a big company and you, you,

1601
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:32,800
you can't like, you just, you don't really have a say in it. You just, you're at the point where

1602
02:17:32,800 --> 02:17:37,200
like, yeah, as a big company, we're just not going to take any risks anymore. We're going to

1603
02:17:37,200 --> 02:17:42,640
let you take the risks for us. You know, um, that's kind of what it sounds like to me. Oh,

1604
02:17:42,640 --> 02:17:46,320
but so many pitches free. If you're actually interested in this whole thing,

1605
02:17:46,320 --> 02:17:52,160
collective.square-enix.com. So check it out. There might be some cool ideas there.

1606
02:17:53,600 --> 02:17:58,640
As long as they're not asking us to crowdfund all the bravest too, we'll be fine. Well, I think,

1607
02:17:58,640 --> 02:18:01,920
well, originally it was supposed to be Eidos games. I think, I don't think they mentioned

1608
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:06,240
Square Enix stuff. Cause you know, one's like, Oh, Hey remake file. It's just a little, it's,

1609
02:18:06,240 --> 02:18:11,280
it's a little joke. Look, he little joke. That's all. All right. Uh, this, this has to be a joke

1610
02:18:11,280 --> 02:18:15,360
too, but I don't think it is. It was an interview that, uh, KJ and Afune, who we've been talking a

1611
02:18:15,360 --> 02:18:20,960
lot about on the show lately because of mighty number nine. Uh, he was, uh, talking about,

1612
02:18:20,960 --> 02:18:26,720
uh, in an interview with, uh, I guess I'm not sure where it was. Was it, was it Japanese magazine

1613
02:18:26,720 --> 02:18:32,000
or what? But, um, sorry, I can't properly credit this here, but, um, he was talking about, uh,

1614
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:38,720
the Kickstarter success and that, uh, if, uh, Capcom were to make an offer about publishing

1615
02:18:38,720 --> 02:18:43,840
the game, he would go with Capcom and saying, quote, there is no reason not to publish with

1616
02:18:43,840 --> 02:18:50,880
Capcom. Uh, he also talked about possibly turning this into a mega man title. If Capcom possibly

1617
02:18:50,880 --> 02:18:55,200
wanted to go that way. Now he is more hesitant about this idea, but he didn't come out and

1618
02:18:55,200 --> 02:19:00,960
exactly say no to it, which the gaming media is like kind of leeching onto a bit too much, I

1619
02:19:00,960 --> 02:19:06,720
think. Uh, but whatever, uh, it says he and his crew really want this to be their thing. Um,

1620
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:12,000
so I kind of think we're grabbing on a little too much about the quote that, you know, if,

1621
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:17,520
if I want to make it a mega man game, I just, I really think that was a poor decision to even

1622
02:19:17,520 --> 02:19:23,040
let that thought go out there because like, seriously, like I crowdfunded all this stuff

1623
02:19:23,120 --> 02:19:26,960
just for this to come out and be another mega man game. I don't get me wrong. I like mega man,

1624
02:19:26,960 --> 02:19:30,240
but it's like, it's, it's weird. I just don't think that they could do this at this point

1625
02:19:30,240 --> 02:19:35,200
because how would they go about making this be a mega? I guess other than calling it mega man,

1626
02:19:35,200 --> 02:19:39,920
I mean, because they have to fill all these backer things as mighty number nine. It's going to be a

1627
02:19:39,920 --> 02:19:43,520
little weird if all of a sudden it's like, it's mega man. Like, you know, imagine if you had

1628
02:19:43,520 --> 02:19:48,080
crowdfunded like a racing game and all of a sudden, Hey, yeah, we're going to go ahead and

1629
02:19:48,080 --> 02:19:53,120
we got funding from somebody. Now it's a casino game. It's like, what? Oh, that doesn't make any

1630
02:19:53,120 --> 02:20:00,960
sense. Um, but I don't know. I mean, essentially maybe the joke is that it's so close to mega man,

1631
02:20:00,960 --> 02:20:05,360
you might as well just call it mega man, you know, and if Capcom paid them some money,

1632
02:20:05,360 --> 02:20:08,560
they'll just call it mega man. It'll be a mega game. Cause it's essentially mega man.

1633
02:20:10,960 --> 02:20:15,600
I think they're drawing straws. All right. Um, I'm going to pause recording here real

1634
02:20:15,600 --> 02:20:21,760
quick because unfortunately our stream is down at server room. Uh, so thank you, sir. I know.

1635
02:20:21,760 --> 02:20:25,840
Right. So, uh, we'll be right back here after a quick look for the podcast listeners. We'll be

1636
02:20:25,840 --> 02:20:29,760
right back after a quick little, uh, music note here. And, uh, we'll talk a little more

1637
02:20:29,760 --> 02:20:35,040
about this and some other news to register participation for this week's episode of orange

1638
02:20:35,040 --> 02:20:39,760
lounge radio at vog network.com. Use the passphrase expert. All right. And we're back

1639
02:20:39,760 --> 02:20:43,760
here at orange lounge radio. Unfortunately, some technical difficulties that were a little bit out

1640
02:20:43,760 --> 02:20:48,080
of our control. Uh, we'll, we'll be following up with our hosting provider this week and

1641
02:20:48,080 --> 02:20:52,480
figuring out why on two Sundays in a row, they have decided to reset the server or whatever

1642
02:20:52,480 --> 02:20:57,120
they're doing that is causing the show to drop out. And, uh, if they can't give us a good answer,

1643
02:20:57,120 --> 02:21:01,920
we will look into a different provider for a future broadcast. In the meantime,

1644
02:21:02,560 --> 02:21:05,920
let's get back where we left off. We've been talking about mighty number nine and the whole

1645
02:21:05,920 --> 02:21:11,600
mega man thing. And the, um, you know, the, the, the fact that it was kick-started and the only

1646
02:21:11,600 --> 02:21:16,080
other thing I want to get out with this is that, you know, I, I get why he says if Capcom makes

1647
02:21:16,080 --> 02:21:20,080
the best publishing deal, then that's the company they're going to go with. Like, that's just

1648
02:21:20,080 --> 02:21:25,040
business, right? I don't think they're going to be, but he would, I think, I think that was kind

1649
02:21:25,040 --> 02:21:29,840
of like interview bait. I think somebody baited him to say that for a headline, like, Oh,

1650
02:21:29,840 --> 02:21:35,280
mighty number nine is going to go through Capcom and it's going to be ironic. It probably won't.

1651
02:21:35,280 --> 02:21:40,080
It could, but I mean, the way Capcom has been going lately and the fact that they, you know,

1652
02:21:40,080 --> 02:21:43,200
kind of denied this guy, the mega man game he wants to make, do you think they're really

1653
02:21:43,200 --> 02:21:47,840
going to come back and make the best deal to publish it? Probably not. I think somebody else

1654
02:21:47,840 --> 02:21:57,200
will. And that'll be that. So, all right. Uh, anyhow, uh, let's move on to our mailbag every

1655
02:21:57,200 --> 02:22:02,880
week. You guys send us emails, mailbag at orange launch, radio.com. And we go through the mailbag

1656
02:22:02,880 --> 02:22:09,600
and try to read some of our favorite emails here. Live dark Sakura dive into that mailbag,

1657
02:22:09,600 --> 02:22:13,440
mailbag at orange launch, radio.com. And, uh, tell us what emails we have tonight.

1658
02:22:13,440 --> 02:22:18,880
We have a few. Um, I will start with the first one from the Nasty Canasta.

1659
02:22:20,400 --> 02:22:24,400
Hi, OLR. I'd like to give my impressions on a game that's soon to be re-released, um,

1660
02:22:24,400 --> 02:22:29,600
Deus Ex Human Revolution. I was sitting in my big ass PC backlog for nearly, no,

1661
02:22:29,600 --> 02:22:33,760
this was sitting in my big ass PC backlog for nearly two years when I finally got around to

1662
02:22:33,760 --> 02:22:39,280
playing it. I snuck a solid hundred hours into it within the span of a month. Um, this is going

1663
02:22:39,280 --> 02:22:44,160
into the story. I'm gonna skip forward because I don't want to spoil it for anyone who might play

1664
02:22:44,160 --> 02:22:49,440
it. So, a game with an engaging plot needs some kickass gameplay to back it up and Deus Ex delivers

1665
02:22:49,440 --> 02:22:54,960
for the most part. This, um, in this first person RPG you can be gung-ho by making use of the guns

1666
02:22:54,960 --> 02:22:59,600
to blast the shit out of people. Take a more merciful route by knocking out enemies, sneaking

1667
02:22:59,600 --> 02:23:05,040
and hacking your way through areas or a combination of all three. It is up to you to play however you

1668
02:23:05,040 --> 02:23:08,960
want, though you'll be making progressively harder choices as you get closer to the end.

1669
02:23:08,960 --> 02:23:12,560
For the record, I watched, um, Becky's husband play through a little bit of this. It was really

1670
02:23:12,560 --> 02:23:19,040
good. Now, I say the game delivers for the most part because there are some significant flaws.

1671
02:23:19,040 --> 02:23:23,040
First, the game's occasionally buggy with handling ragdolls, especially when they clip and get stuck

1672
02:23:23,040 --> 02:23:28,400
in floors. Icky. Second, while the game rewards XP for various actions you do, you are awarded the

1673
02:23:28,400 --> 02:23:33,680
most points for playing pacifist with stealth. Although you can play however you want, the XP

1674
02:23:33,760 --> 02:23:39,040
rewards are pretty much big neon signs saying, want this augmentation? Do melee takedowns, bro!

1675
02:23:39,840 --> 02:23:43,840
Even though one of the game's achievements requires to not kill anyone in your entire

1676
02:23:43,840 --> 02:23:49,040
playthrough. Finally, the boss fights stand out like a sore thumb. They force the player into

1677
02:23:49,040 --> 02:23:54,480
lethal combat, which puts pacifist players at a major disadvantage given their play style and the

1678
02:23:54,480 --> 02:23:59,440
items they'll be carrying in their inventory. Despite these problems, I highly encourage

1679
02:23:59,440 --> 02:24:03,600
everyone to try it out, especially if you have a PC or got the game through PlayStation Plus.

1680
02:24:04,400 --> 02:24:08,960
The re-release fixes boss fights for pacifist players. I need to get back to the screen.

1681
02:24:13,680 --> 02:24:18,960
Has touchscreen players for all platforms, Wii U, GamePad, Smart Glass, PS3, Vita, CrossControl,

1682
02:24:18,960 --> 02:24:24,960
and TBA for PC, and bundles of DLC content. And before I forget, the game looks absolutely

1683
02:24:24,960 --> 02:24:28,480
gorgeous and the soundtrack is fantastic. And that comes from the Nasty Canasta.

1684
02:24:29,840 --> 02:24:34,400
I've heard many, many good things about that game. Speaking of which, it will be coming out again.

1685
02:24:34,400 --> 02:24:40,160
They're doing a director's cut that's coming out in the 22nd North America and for the first time

1686
02:24:40,160 --> 02:24:45,920
on the Wii U as well. So that'll be on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 for about 30 bucks. And Wii U,

1687
02:24:46,720 --> 02:24:50,080
which this is a great selling point, the Wii U version is actually $20 more.

1688
02:24:50,640 --> 02:25:00,320
So next email. Yes.

1689
02:25:01,040 --> 02:25:06,240
Hey guys, Monty Boggs here. Just thought I would email in and share my thoughts on the 2DS.

1690
02:25:06,240 --> 02:25:11,120
I bought one last afternoon along with Pokemon Y naturally, and I am completely surprised by

1691
02:25:11,120 --> 02:25:15,120
how much I enjoyed this handheld system. I was negative on the system at the original

1692
02:25:15,120 --> 02:25:19,280
announcement, but with the low price, I thought I would give it a shot. It fits pretty good in

1693
02:25:19,280 --> 02:25:23,680
my bigger, it should be pretty well in my bigger hands. It's a minimalist design.

1694
02:25:24,560 --> 02:25:28,320
It's minimalist design features and price are all I'm looking for in a system to play on the

1695
02:25:28,320 --> 02:25:34,960
couch at home or throw my laptop back on the go. I think anyone wanting to get access to the 3DS

1696
02:25:34,960 --> 02:25:39,920
library and doesn't care about 3D should at least consider a 2DS as I personally think it is the

1697
02:25:39,920 --> 02:25:46,640
best feeling portable in some time. Also the $70 cheaper price more than makes up for the smaller

1698
02:25:46,640 --> 02:25:52,640
screen than the XL. On a side note, I'm already six hours into Pokemon and I'm not the type of

1699
02:25:52,640 --> 02:25:56,960
gamer that typically plays that much at a time. I haven't played a Pokemon game since the GBA,

1700
02:25:56,960 --> 02:26:02,080
so I'm not exactly the typical Pokemon fanatic either. So while lots of people are talking

1701
02:26:02,080 --> 02:26:08,640
next gen, I'm going to be perfectly happy with my new Wii U and 2DS combo for the foreseeable future.

1702
02:26:08,640 --> 02:26:12,480
I can't wait for Super Mario 3D World and the new Legend of Zelda for 3DS.

1703
02:26:12,480 --> 02:26:14,320
Love the show. Take care. Monty Boggs.

1704
02:26:16,560 --> 02:26:19,840
I'm glad that you're enjoying it. It sounds like he is quite enjoy.

1705
02:26:20,640 --> 02:26:21,840
Quite enjoy. Quite enjoy.

1706
02:26:22,560 --> 02:26:25,680
All right, we have two emails left. One of them is long. Kinda long.

1707
02:26:27,280 --> 02:26:32,000
Hello, OLR gang. This is my first time giving my voice to the show,

1708
02:26:32,000 --> 02:26:36,720
being on the East Coast and having to be up Monday at 5 30 AM. I'm not able to listen to

1709
02:26:36,720 --> 02:26:41,440
your show live. I do, however, listen to every episode while I'm at work every Monday morning.

1710
02:26:41,440 --> 02:26:42,800
Well, I'm glad you do. Thank you.

1711
02:26:44,160 --> 02:26:49,120
I am a 34 year old gamer who started gaming fairly late compared to you guys. My first

1712
02:26:49,120 --> 02:26:54,080
console was the original NES. And let me go back to the stupid chat room before it logs out.

1713
02:26:54,720 --> 02:26:59,440
Okay. My parents were not a fan of me spending time on gaming and not interacting with people,

1714
02:26:59,440 --> 02:27:03,760
so I never got another console until I was older and able to purchase my own.

1715
02:27:03,760 --> 02:27:10,240
So to make a life story short, I've only played NES, PS2, original Wii and Xbox 360.

1716
02:27:10,240 --> 02:27:14,880
I do, however, find that I'm mostly a PC gamer. I started in PC gaming, I guess you could say,

1717
02:27:15,920 --> 02:27:24,800
on my appearance of 486 DX 66 and Commander Keen, although I didn't really get into gaming until my

1718
02:27:24,800 --> 02:27:30,400
first MMO, Dark Ages of Camelot. I was so addicted to that game, I would play until 2 or 3 AM and

1719
02:27:30,400 --> 02:27:34,880
then wake up at 6 30 the next morning for school. Those were the days when I would do that and not

1720
02:27:34,880 --> 02:27:41,920
feel like crap the next morning. Since DAOC, I have jumped around from MMO to MMO. I've played

1721
02:27:41,920 --> 02:27:45,680
WoW, Star Wars Galaxy, Star Wars The Old Republic, Champions Online, Guild Wars 2, Neverwinter,

1722
02:27:45,680 --> 02:27:50,320
just to name a few. I'm sure there are more that I'm forgetting about. Currently I decided to see

1723
02:27:50,320 --> 02:27:54,640
what all the hype about Mass Effect was all about, so I purchased the trilogy during the summer

1724
02:27:54,640 --> 02:27:58,640
months when it was on sale. I've played through all of Mass Effect 1 and 2 and I'm currently

1725
02:27:58,640 --> 02:28:02,640
working on 3. I do have to say I've enjoyed the storyline, but there are some things that annoy

1726
02:28:02,640 --> 02:28:06,960
me about the games like in Mass Effect 2 and Mass Effect 3, not being able to open the journal

1727
02:28:06,960 --> 02:28:11,520
without hitting escape and then clicking the journal menu item. Why couldn't they make a key

1728
02:28:11,520 --> 02:28:14,880
bind for the stuff like that? By the way, I think that some of the menu differences in that were

1729
02:28:14,880 --> 02:28:19,760
just with the differences of the Unreal Engine. I do believe, because you'll notice also their

1730
02:28:19,760 --> 02:28:22,400
texture rendering was different. A lot of the menu systems are different.

1731
02:28:24,800 --> 02:28:31,600
Also, I think if you are playing on PC, you can create a bind to load your journal, but you have

1732
02:28:31,600 --> 02:28:41,360
to mod your coalesced INI to put that in there. If you go to my tumblr, masseffecting.tumblr.com,

1733
02:28:41,360 --> 02:28:46,880
I will see if I can find the answer to that and show you how to make the key bind. I even share

1734
02:28:46,880 --> 02:28:53,040
my own coalesced INI with you. Just saying, because I am totally into modding my games.

1735
02:28:55,120 --> 02:28:59,120
Anyways, enough about Mass Effect, enough about me. I thought I was about to say Mass Effect,

1736
02:28:59,120 --> 02:29:03,600
but it's actually me. My question for you guys to ponder, with Valve's latest announcements about

1737
02:29:03,600 --> 02:29:08,880
the Steam Machine and SteamOS, do you think this could have game makers to start considering PC

1738
02:29:08,880 --> 02:29:15,440
gaming as a viable competitor in the console war? With a 5 year old daughter, I have had to focus

1739
02:29:15,440 --> 02:29:20,400
my gaming on PC. With a second child on the way in June, I've had to put my plans to purchase the

1740
02:29:20,400 --> 02:29:28,400
next gen in the new year on the back burner. By the way, congratulations. Indeed. I do, however,

1741
02:29:28,400 --> 02:29:35,360
have a fairly powerful i5 dual core with 60GB of RAM PC that I thought could handle most of the

1742
02:29:35,360 --> 02:29:39,760
games that will be coming out. I'm hoping my thoughts on the Steam Machines and SteamOS

1743
02:29:39,760 --> 02:29:44,560
bringing PC gaming into direct competition with consoles is true, so more games will come out for

1744
02:29:44,560 --> 02:29:50,960
PC, and the ones that do come out will come out around the same times as console, unlike GTA 5.

1745
02:29:54,480 --> 02:30:01,120
I think it's still too early to call that. I think that right now PC is going to continue to be

1746
02:30:01,120 --> 02:30:08,240
treated the same way, but if whatever the Steam Box ends up being does give more accessibility

1747
02:30:08,960 --> 02:30:13,440
to those PC games, then they might think about it. But right now, I can tell you just about

1748
02:30:13,440 --> 02:30:17,760
anything, when you have a business market, people are slow to try something new. Unless they are

1749
02:30:17,760 --> 02:30:24,800
desperate. Just saying. Sorry, can you summarize for me, because I was firing off an angry email

1750
02:30:24,800 --> 02:30:31,280
to our service provider about what's going on. If you think the oncoming Steam Box and SteamOS

1751
02:30:31,280 --> 02:30:39,120
will cause PC gaming to be more of a competitor to the console market. Nah. I don't think so.

1752
02:30:39,280 --> 02:30:45,360
I think it's so early to say, because the price is a huge motivator in that regard.

1753
02:30:48,400 --> 02:30:54,240
I don't know. The Steam Machine is trying to take things closer to a dedicated game processor

1754
02:30:54,240 --> 02:31:00,320
and device, but it's not really one. It's more dedicated than maybe a Windows machine is, but

1755
02:31:00,320 --> 02:31:07,120
it's not solely dedicated like a Playstation or an Xbox is. So I'm not sure that certain things that

1756
02:31:07,120 --> 02:31:10,960
you do on a gaming console will necessarily be possible on one of these devices. I don't know.

1757
02:31:10,960 --> 02:31:15,920
I sort of just think there's still room for the consoles. I think there's some potential there,

1758
02:31:15,920 --> 02:31:20,000
but what my point was is that a lot of times when you're dealing with the consumer market,

1759
02:31:20,560 --> 02:31:26,880
people are slow to switch up what works. They don't want to make the big risk unless they're

1760
02:31:26,880 --> 02:31:33,120
completely desperate. Anyway, thanks for the great shows. I love listening to the many shows on VOG,

1761
02:31:33,120 --> 02:31:38,880
including Bobby Show, OLR, and Hoard House. The shows help to make my work week a lot more

1762
02:31:38,880 --> 02:31:43,760
interesting. And have a great one, Cyber Judge. Thank you for emailing us. Thank you. It's always,

1763
02:31:43,760 --> 02:31:46,880
um, I like hearing from the veterans and the people that talk to us frequently,

1764
02:31:46,880 --> 02:31:50,640
but I like hearing from new people too. I really like hearing from new people.

1765
02:31:51,920 --> 02:31:58,960
Although I love all of you guys. Hey guys! Hey! So I've been trying to get into gaming,

1766
02:31:58,960 --> 02:32:04,640
but even though I have a dual box Mac Pro, Macbook Pro, I still wonder what game I should

1767
02:32:04,640 --> 02:32:10,400
play since I am, like, broke as a joke. I mean, I know Final Fantasy XIV is out, but I cannot afford

1768
02:32:10,400 --> 02:32:15,440
it. I enjoyed it during the open beta, but a connection etc issue kept me from really enjoying

1769
02:32:15,440 --> 02:32:19,840
it. I wish I could afford it while I'm looking for a job, but it's going to be a little hard for me

1770
02:32:19,840 --> 02:32:26,720
too. What do you guys think that it's, do you guys think that it's one of those games that will last

1771
02:32:26,720 --> 02:32:31,360
for a while, like Eleven did? Is there any Mac or PC games you think I should try in your opinion?

1772
02:32:31,360 --> 02:32:36,000
That's free. Thank you for answering me. If so, you're a listener of many years uni.

1773
02:32:37,680 --> 02:32:42,400
Um, well, if your computer is solid enough to run Final Fantasy XIV at all during the beta,

1774
02:32:42,400 --> 02:32:46,160
then there's a lot of free to play stuff out there that you can check out. And some of those are,

1775
02:32:46,160 --> 02:32:50,080
you know, MMO type things. I mean, you've got Star Wars, the older, well, I don't know how many of

1776
02:32:50,080 --> 02:32:55,440
these are on Mac. That's the problem. Ragnarok Online, I think, might, or Ragnarok 2 anyway.

1777
02:32:56,080 --> 02:33:04,240
But I used to play the old school Ragnarok Online through free servers on a Mac using an emulator.

1778
02:33:05,440 --> 02:33:09,120
I have to admit, I don't know which of these are playable on Mac, but I will tell you Star Wars,

1779
02:33:09,120 --> 02:33:16,160
The Old Republic, Rift, both free, both very solid MMOs to check out. I would highly recommend

1780
02:33:16,160 --> 02:33:20,320
getting Steam and checking out the free to play game section on there because there's an awful

1781
02:33:20,320 --> 02:33:26,160
lot in there. Uh, more MMOs, even things like Star Trek Online, uh, Marvel Heroes is a pretty

1782
02:33:26,160 --> 02:33:30,160
fun to play one. If you like Diablo at all, and you like your comic book people, that's free to

1783
02:33:30,160 --> 02:33:34,720
play as well. Um, even things that are like up a totally different alley, like Spiral Knights,

1784
02:33:34,720 --> 02:33:39,920
Sega is there, you know, there's, there's more and more free to play stuff on Steam that's worth

1785
02:33:39,920 --> 02:33:44,880
checking out and Steam's gonna make it very clear what's on Mac and what's not. And you can also,

1786
02:33:44,880 --> 02:33:48,640
if it's still going on the Not On Steam sale, because I do believe there were some Mac titles

1787
02:33:48,640 --> 02:33:54,000
included in that. Right. They weren't free, but they're low, low, low cost. Yeah. Pretty cheap.

1788
02:33:54,000 --> 02:33:58,720
Yeah. Don't be afraid to play stuff that's maybe under the radar because there's some great indie

1789
02:33:58,720 --> 02:34:02,480
games and things that, you know, not, maybe not everybody's necessarily into right at this moment

1790
02:34:02,480 --> 02:34:07,840
that are still worth checking out. I also do suggest installing, what is it called for, um,

1791
02:34:08,640 --> 02:34:14,240
not Flash, but it's a game engine that runs through, um, browsers that, uh, the Disney games,

1792
02:34:14,240 --> 02:34:18,800
like the Wreck-It Ralph games used. Yuni's actually in our chat right now saying that

1793
02:34:18,800 --> 02:34:22,960
she has dual boxed Windows 7 and Mac Mountain Lion. Oh, well then you're good for a lot of

1794
02:34:22,960 --> 02:34:26,960
these games you're talking. If you want MMOs, I would say check out the Old Republic if you

1795
02:34:26,960 --> 02:34:31,600
even remotely like BioWare games or Star Wars. And I don't think you necessarily even have to

1796
02:34:31,600 --> 02:34:35,120
like Star Wars to enjoy the Old Republic. I still think it's pretty good game on its own.

1797
02:34:35,120 --> 02:34:40,240
And Rift for sure. If you liked Warcraft and that you'd probably like Rift. And someone might gift

1798
02:34:40,240 --> 02:34:47,120
you Mass Effect when it goes for sale again. Someone. Somebody super nice. Yeah. There's

1799
02:34:47,120 --> 02:34:50,320
some really nice persons sitting at this table right now. Uh, Dungeon Buster in our chat room

1800
02:34:50,320 --> 02:34:54,800
at live.fognetwork.com says Neverwinter is a pretty decent free to play Dungeons & Dragons MMO.

1801
02:34:54,800 --> 02:34:58,480
Yes, I've heard of that one too. It's Unity. That's, that's what I thought it was, but I

1802
02:34:58,480 --> 02:35:04,480
didn't quite want to call it. I'd be wrong. So is that it for emails? Yup. There you go.

1803
02:35:04,480 --> 02:35:08,240
Mailbag at orangelauntrader.com if you have a question for a future week.

1804
02:35:08,960 --> 02:35:13,360
All right. Uh, let's do the FUs of the week folks. Cause we're mad.

1805
02:35:30,720 --> 02:35:35,040
FU to my stepdad. And to put this in the most general of terms.

1806
02:35:35,040 --> 02:35:42,000
Just because somebody else doesn't believe something that you, that you do, or doesn't

1807
02:35:42,000 --> 02:35:46,960
agree with you does not mean that they're closed minded. For all you know, they could have done

1808
02:35:46,960 --> 02:35:53,680
their research and found that it's not for them. Using inflammatory statements to try to guilt

1809
02:35:53,680 --> 02:35:59,120
trip somebody into changing their opinion or into evoking an emotional response that makes

1810
02:35:59,120 --> 02:36:04,320
you look like you're staying calm is no way to have a discussion. It's immature and it is beneath

1811
02:36:04,320 --> 02:36:09,920
you and I am done. What you showed me was pretty tacky. That's really the best word I can think

1812
02:36:09,920 --> 02:36:17,760
of for it. Tacky. Loki. Uh, FU to

1813
02:36:20,240 --> 02:36:25,680
Grand Theft Auto 5. Cause that's all I'm playing. I don't know. It's become your life. FU to the

1814
02:36:25,680 --> 02:36:32,080
fact that I don't have a voice today. FU to stress, making me sick when I eat and FU to

1815
02:36:32,080 --> 02:36:36,400
the fact that our show cut out while we're trying to do it. I hate that. Especially when

1816
02:36:36,400 --> 02:36:42,400
it's out of our control. Rawr. Definitely a suitable FU of the week. All right. A couple

1817
02:36:42,400 --> 02:36:45,680
more stories for you guys. Then we'll open up the Skypline for a little bit and try to do some

1818
02:36:45,680 --> 02:36:49,280
Twitter topics as well too. I'm going to, I'm going to warn you guys with this. If you want

1819
02:36:49,280 --> 02:36:53,280
to get in on the Skypline tonight, you need to call like as soon as we open it up. Cause I can't,

1820
02:36:53,280 --> 02:36:56,240
we're not going to be able to sit around tonight and wait for seven minutes going,

1821
02:36:56,240 --> 02:37:00,480
is somebody going to call? Somebody going to call? So either you want to participate or you

1822
02:37:00,480 --> 02:37:05,280
don't tonight. Rawr. You have a 10 second window. All right. You better be on it. But after two

1823
02:37:05,280 --> 02:37:11,840
stories. So Loki, you first. So despite some sort of a delay in the whole purchasing process,

1824
02:37:11,840 --> 02:37:18,240
thanks to the Delaware Supreme Court, um, the ruling has, um, made, made in favor of

1825
02:37:18,240 --> 02:37:24,640
Activision and yes, they will be allowed to buy the, um, I guess $8.2 billion of their own shares

1826
02:37:24,640 --> 02:37:34,000
from Vivendi. Um, and just a few days here on October 15th. So they will once they will become

1827
02:37:34,000 --> 02:37:39,200
their own company again, I guess, or more of their own company. So I remember hearing about this

1828
02:37:39,200 --> 02:37:44,720
before a little bit. So the news here is that it's been approved basically. So, because there was

1829
02:37:44,720 --> 02:37:49,280
concern, was it wasn't, it was a shareholder. It was one of the shareholders that was

1830
02:37:49,280 --> 02:37:55,120
seeing that they were doing this to somehow, I don't know, somehow screw them out of money

1831
02:37:55,120 --> 02:38:00,880
or something. I don't know how it was. Um, but yeah, it basically got over overturned, so

1832
02:38:02,080 --> 02:38:07,520
they can do it. All right. Uh, well, you know what? All the changes I've seen in World of

1833
02:38:07,520 --> 02:38:12,160
Warcraft ever since this split have been for the better. So, and Diablo three, hello,

1834
02:38:12,160 --> 02:38:15,600
auction house going away. That's great news. That's going to bring a whole group of new people into

1835
02:38:15,600 --> 02:38:21,760
the game. So we'll see. Meanwhile, Hey, we, you owners, I know you have been waiting for

1836
02:38:21,760 --> 02:38:27,040
that killer game that will finally just make this thing fucking fly off of shelves. And, uh, you

1837
02:38:27,040 --> 02:38:31,600
know, it might be, it might be, you know, Mario 3d world two or whatever it could be. It could be

1838
02:38:31,600 --> 02:38:36,560
a Mario Kart eight or what have you, but you know what I think it's going to be. I think that killer

1839
02:38:36,560 --> 02:38:43,680
must have app for the Wii U is going to be Hello Kitty cruisers, which is coming to the Wii U this

1840
02:38:43,680 --> 02:38:48,800
year beating Mario Kart eight to the party. And, uh, that's Hello Kitty cruisers by the way,

1841
02:38:48,800 --> 02:38:54,400
with a K and all I know is from this screenshot, you can play as bad bats Maru. I mean,

1842
02:38:54,400 --> 02:38:59,760
do you, do you fucking need anything else in a Hello Kitty game? Well, you can totally get a

1843
02:38:59,760 --> 02:39:05,040
jacked version of rainbow road from the Mario Kart games with little Hello Kitty space planets.

1844
02:39:05,040 --> 02:39:08,720
I don't know what else to call these things from the back room. I wonder if you can play

1845
02:39:08,720 --> 02:39:13,920
as little twin stars. Who knows anything's possible. Um, so there are some screenshots

1846
02:39:13,920 --> 02:39:17,760
available and, uh, yeah, you can check that out, uh, coming later this year. I don't know how much

1847
02:39:17,760 --> 02:39:23,200
and I don't know exactly what day, but, uh, it's Hello Kitty. Oh, it's November 5th. And how much?

1848
02:39:23,200 --> 02:39:28,400
I think it's $40. If I remember correctly, the countdown is on and it's a slight budget title.

1849
02:39:28,960 --> 02:39:35,120
It's not a $60 game. It's $40. It's, uh, yeah, it's this company in Burgos or Burgosala lightweight

1850
02:39:35,200 --> 02:39:40,880
or something like that. And they, uh, mainly just do Hello Kitty games. They just released

1851
02:39:40,880 --> 02:39:48,320
one actually on the 3DS last week or week before last. I am excited as hell. What can I say?

1852
02:39:48,960 --> 02:39:55,040
So yeah, it's, um, I don't know. And I did mention it back in June, by the way,

1853
02:39:55,040 --> 02:40:01,280
remember on, on Twitter, I'd mentioned there was a game of show and I forgot. I forgot. You know

1854
02:40:01,280 --> 02:40:06,000
what, if I'm not seeing news on it every five seconds, it tends to, uh, go away from my memory,

1855
02:40:06,000 --> 02:40:10,560
you know, as, as, as a lot of people and as a lot of folks in gaming culture, we tend to forget

1856
02:40:10,560 --> 02:40:15,440
these things, right? Yes. Remember, remember when, uh, Sony went down for an entire day and,

1857
02:40:15,440 --> 02:40:18,560
and everybody said, I'll never buy another Sony product again. And then they unveiled

1858
02:40:18,560 --> 02:40:24,160
the PlayStation four and everybody was like, Oh, nevermind. I'm just kidding. Yeah. Yeah.

1859
02:40:24,160 --> 02:40:27,440
Sony went down for a long time. Remember that. Remember when they had a problem with their clocks

1860
02:40:27,440 --> 02:40:33,280
and it comes? All right. Anyhow, uh, let's do it. Let's get to some phone calls. One eight seven

1861
02:40:33,280 --> 02:40:37,600
seven game OLR or a username on Skype is orange lounge radio, but we already have a call coming

1862
02:40:37,600 --> 02:40:41,920
in. So let's get to it. Hi, you're on orange launch radio. Who's this? Yo guys, it's Zina

1863
02:40:41,920 --> 02:40:46,080
core from OKC. How you doing? Hey Zina core. Good to hear from you as always. How are you? We're

1864
02:40:46,080 --> 02:40:51,200
good. It's good to know. I know about the right time for the delay in the radio to pick up. So

1865
02:40:51,200 --> 02:40:55,680
you've got this down to a science. You beat Rama tonight. That's something. Oh, cool. I'll put,

1866
02:40:55,680 --> 02:40:59,280
I'll put that on my list. All right. Give yourself a gold star. All right. What's up?

1867
02:40:59,280 --> 02:41:05,440
What's in your mind, buddy? Uh, the, uh, the web game for the fan made attack on Titan game. That

1868
02:41:05,440 --> 02:41:11,200
thing is actually pretty damn polished. I was surprised. Hmm. What is it? Have you guys not

1869
02:41:11,200 --> 02:41:14,960
seen it yet? No, I haven't. Tell us a little more about this. I haven't been into the anime at all.

1870
02:41:14,960 --> 02:41:21,120
So I've been pretty much ignoring it on Tumblr. Now that some guy used the unity engine to make

1871
02:41:21,200 --> 02:41:28,800
a fan, uh, inspired version of defending humanity against the Titans and it's pretty damn good. It

1872
02:41:28,800 --> 02:41:33,920
plays really well. It almost feels like Spiderman as far as the swinging mechanic is down. It's

1873
02:41:33,920 --> 02:41:37,760
really intuitive after a couple of matches and it's just as deadly as the real game is. So

1874
02:41:38,560 --> 02:41:44,080
yeah, I highly encourage everybody to play it. There you go. How much is that? Is that a free

1875
02:41:44,080 --> 02:41:48,320
one? Oh yeah, it's free. It's got just making it and threw it up on the interwebs just because

1876
02:41:48,320 --> 02:41:52,640
he loves the, uh, loves the game. I just threw the link up there in chat if anybody wants to

1877
02:41:52,640 --> 02:41:57,440
check it out. Nice. It's fangly.com slash game slash AOG. So, well, there's something for the

1878
02:41:57,440 --> 02:42:00,560
email or a little bit ago who is looking for some free games to play. There you go.

1879
02:42:01,120 --> 02:42:05,680
Yeah, there you go. What else have you been playing lately? Uh, that and some war thunder

1880
02:42:05,680 --> 02:42:13,280
online just to get my, uh, air to air combat jeans taken care of. Yeah, that's done, that's

1881
02:42:13,280 --> 02:42:16,560
done pretty well. They're getting ready to release the tanks too. Apparently they're trying to do

1882
02:42:16,560 --> 02:42:23,200
both land, sea and air battles all in one, a massive arena game, uh, all of world war two.

1883
02:42:23,200 --> 02:42:28,320
So it's quite extensive. It's really good. Uh, you fan pretty regularly these, uh, air fighting

1884
02:42:28,320 --> 02:42:32,480
games, like Ace Combat stuff? Every once in a while. I mean, they just now started popping up

1885
02:42:32,480 --> 02:42:36,560
in the, I guess since League of Legends took over, everybody's doing their own version of

1886
02:42:36,560 --> 02:42:41,920
massive online battle arena. Oh, I didn't even realize they kind of did that in, uh,

1887
02:42:41,920 --> 02:42:48,320
like airplane form. Yeah. I mean, you just spawn in everybody, depending on what army you're with,

1888
02:42:48,320 --> 02:42:51,760
you pick a side, you fight it out and sooner or later somebody wins the battle and that's it.

1889
02:42:51,760 --> 02:42:55,280
That's kind of cool. Gosh, I don't remember the last time I like seriously played like a

1890
02:42:55,280 --> 02:43:00,720
airplane combat game like that. It was probably top gun on the NES. And, uh, you go into that

1891
02:43:00,720 --> 02:43:07,200
intense rage when you can't refuel your damn plane. Oh yeah, most definitely. And, uh, since

1892
02:43:07,200 --> 02:43:10,960
this one's free on steam, it's bound to be picking up tons of people, especially with this next

1893
02:43:10,960 --> 02:43:15,360
experience when they add tanks, they just teased it over in, uh, in one of the Russian cons. So

1894
02:43:15,360 --> 02:43:21,120
it looked quite good. I'm all about free steam is really developing a nice little free library on

1895
02:43:21,120 --> 02:43:25,440
there. It's pretty cool. So that's going to be the neat thing when they get that steam machine

1896
02:43:25,440 --> 02:43:28,880
out there, it's going to be huge marketing thing for them is that, Hey, all you have to do is buy

1897
02:43:28,880 --> 02:43:34,160
the system and you can get all these games for free because they're all free. So it's a great

1898
02:43:34,160 --> 02:43:39,040
way to market stuff. So, yeah. So that's what I've been up to, man. Y'all take it easy. Excellent

1899
02:43:39,360 --> 02:43:44,800
All right. It's awesome to hear from you as always take care. All right. Bye. I like hearing

1900
02:43:44,800 --> 02:43:48,880
fans of games, especially when they're free, come on the show and then plug them like, Hey,

1901
02:43:48,880 --> 02:43:52,240
is this off your radar? Cause maybe it should like be on your radar if it's something you're

1902
02:43:52,240 --> 02:43:56,480
interested in. So appreciate that. Let's open up the phone one more time. You can call us at

1903
02:43:56,480 --> 02:44:02,640
1 8 7 7 game O L R or you can contact us on Skype, orange lounge radio, all one word. Uh,

1904
02:44:02,640 --> 02:44:06,320
while we wait for another call to come in, I've got a couple tweets to read about. Oh no,

1905
02:44:06,320 --> 02:44:10,720
they're there. Phone lines already lighten up near mine, but I will get to tweets and last

1906
02:44:10,720 --> 02:44:15,200
minute stories here in a minute. First, let me go to the phones. Hi on orange on radio. Who's this?

1907
02:44:15,200 --> 02:44:20,720
Hey, it's Ron. Hey buddy. You got beat tonight. Well, that's because I'm still dealing with stuff

1908
02:44:20,720 --> 02:44:26,560
from New York comic con. So excuses, excuses. All right. Well, tell us about the con already. How

1909
02:44:26,560 --> 02:44:33,520
was it? It was pretty good. I have to admit for a Saturday, it wasn't as crowded as I thought it

1910
02:44:33,520 --> 02:44:40,160
was really. Yeah. Is that because everybody was so pissed off that their Twitters were tweeting

1911
02:44:40,160 --> 02:44:45,200
things that they weren't intending on saying about the show. I just, I heard about this. No,

1912
02:44:45,200 --> 02:44:51,840
I want you to know that when you register your badge, you can opt out of that. And we all know

1913
02:44:51,840 --> 02:44:57,600
not everybody reads the fine print. You fill out the form, you spin down to the end that you

1914
02:44:57,600 --> 02:45:02,240
accept and you acknowledge, add this, add that done. Did you guys hear about this? What happened?

1915
02:45:02,320 --> 02:45:06,240
Like, yeah, the people that were registering and, and for whatever, for New York comic con,

1916
02:45:06,240 --> 02:45:09,840
I don't know why, but they were tying their Twitter accounts or something to the registration.

1917
02:45:09,840 --> 02:45:14,480
And like when they, when the smartphones picked up that these guys were at the convention,

1918
02:45:14,480 --> 02:45:18,800
it would automatically tweet, I'm having a great time in New York comic con. And people were like,

1919
02:45:18,800 --> 02:45:23,600
pissed that this thing was tweeting for stupid. They shut it down and like,

1920
02:45:23,600 --> 02:45:30,160
they shut it down in like 12 hours. That's that intrusive advertising we were talking about

1921
02:45:30,160 --> 02:45:37,440
earlier. Not smart. So anyway, sorry. Now that we got the little dark cloud around comic con out

1922
02:45:37,440 --> 02:45:40,800
of the way, tell us more about the good stuff. Not to mention the other dark cloud around comic con.

1923
02:45:41,440 --> 02:45:44,320
Oh, I didn't hear about other stuff. Was there more shenanigans I didn't hear about?

1924
02:45:47,280 --> 02:45:52,400
Listen, listen to my podcast. We're going to talk about that in depth because I have a personal

1925
02:45:52,400 --> 02:45:57,680
interest in that. Oh my. All right. I guess I've missed the news. Being busy with my show

1926
02:45:57,680 --> 02:46:00,640
yesterday probably made me miss that. If you read my Tumblr, you would have seen it.

1927
02:46:00,640 --> 02:46:06,880
Well, I have not read your Tumblr, Jamie, because I've been busy. But anyway, sorry if your Tumblr

1928
02:46:06,880 --> 02:46:13,200
isn't the first place I go on the internet for all the news, DarkSakura. All right. But for real,

1929
02:46:13,200 --> 02:46:16,080
tell us, tell us some good news out of New York comic con for heaven's sake.

1930
02:46:18,320 --> 02:46:24,000
Um, the re-release of Ron Mo and F on Blu-ray. Oh, that sounds nice. Yes.

1931
02:46:24,160 --> 02:46:31,120
Um, I was asked to be a part of, um, a retrospective that Viz is putting out and

1932
02:46:31,120 --> 02:46:36,960
we got to see some screenshots between a DVD and a Blu-ray. It looks beautiful. And,

1933
02:46:37,920 --> 02:46:48,240
and for Ookchan's sake, they're re-subbing the episodes. Ooh, happy. Yes. Yes. I hope they're

1934
02:46:48,240 --> 02:46:53,520
more accurate. Yes. You're going to shed a tear when you watch this. Yay. I need this then. This

1935
02:46:53,600 --> 02:46:57,760
has to be a part of my life. So were they actually showing this at comic con, the new Blu-ray?

1936
02:46:58,560 --> 02:47:03,680
They, yeah, they actually showed it on, I think Thursday or Friday, because I only had a one day

1937
02:47:03,680 --> 02:47:08,480
badge and I was talking about how much they saw it and I'm like, I hate you guys. Nice. And you

1938
02:47:08,480 --> 02:47:13,600
know, your name is DJ Rama S. So you, you have a slight passing interest in, in things related to

1939
02:47:13,600 --> 02:47:21,200
this series, right? Yeah, pretty much. I was, I think one of the reasons why it wasn't as crowded

1940
02:47:21,200 --> 02:47:26,240
Saturday is because in order for you to get into the con, you had to cut through the, you had to

1941
02:47:26,240 --> 02:47:31,520
check in. The check-in areas were outside in the parking lot areas in front of the convention

1942
02:47:31,520 --> 02:47:37,120
center. Cause when I walked in, when I walked in, they had, they finally incorporated the

1943
02:47:37,120 --> 02:47:43,920
Q room type setup for everybody to go into. And from that, it just kind of flowed like water.

1944
02:47:43,920 --> 02:47:52,720
What is the secret to not getting a backed up as hell line at your convention? You've

1945
02:47:52,720 --> 02:47:58,720
been to enough conventions. I think that would be it, the Q line, because when it comes to cons,

1946
02:47:58,720 --> 02:48:05,200
people will say, they will stay on the site, pre-regs at this time, people will show up

1947
02:48:05,840 --> 02:48:13,360
one to two hours prior just to get their badge, especially for Otakon. Because during the summer

1948
02:48:13,360 --> 02:48:19,360
in Baltimore, the temperature tends to hit triple digits. And I have seen people out there for three

1949
02:48:19,360 --> 02:48:24,800
and four hours at a time and pretty much in full costumes. It's the same way at AX.

1950
02:48:26,080 --> 02:48:30,080
That's why there's actually this, why this sort of thing started for a little bit of

1951
02:48:30,080 --> 02:48:37,600
your registration line costume. No, for real, it's a variation of a costume or a character

1952
02:48:37,600 --> 02:48:41,840
that you're doing that is more comfortable to wear in line, but still is, you know,

1953
02:48:42,480 --> 02:48:48,720
acceptable to wear out in the triple digits. Yeah, pretty much. Between you and me, I'd rather

1954
02:48:48,720 --> 02:48:54,320
get to the hotel, relax for a few hours, then head on over, pick up my badge and then go meet

1955
02:48:54,320 --> 02:48:58,800
up with friends to eat. I'd rather do that. I like when AX started doing day before pre-reg

1956
02:48:59,760 --> 02:49:03,200
to pick, where you could pick up your badges the day before the convention

1957
02:49:04,400 --> 02:49:08,640
for everyone who pre-registered, registered so that the lines were left for regular registration.

1958
02:49:08,640 --> 02:49:14,480
Yeah, well, but what things was happening now is even if you pre-reg and you pick up the day

1959
02:49:14,480 --> 02:49:19,760
before, you think that would help? No, you still have people who show up the day of and usually

1960
02:49:19,760 --> 02:49:24,640
out there at five o'clock in the morning just to get a badge. Meanwhile, doors don't open till

1961
02:49:24,640 --> 02:49:29,280
nine. Word of advice, don't wear combat boots that are not adjusted to your feet

1962
02:49:31,040 --> 02:49:33,840
in line for registration or masquerade. Just saying.

1963
02:49:34,640 --> 02:49:38,720
There is a meme I wrote about that I have to post on your wall. You'll appreciate it.

1964
02:49:39,360 --> 02:49:44,480
Just remind me to tell you sometime about the days of my Jill Valentine costume.

1965
02:49:45,520 --> 02:49:48,080
Will do. Playing DDR in combat boots is not fun.

1966
02:49:48,640 --> 02:49:53,120
Sorry. I beat that dress as Ranma. Those sandals, I will never do it again.

1967
02:49:54,080 --> 02:49:58,960
Sorry, I got really quiet there, but I took a moment to go visit the news source that I should

1968
02:49:58,960 --> 02:50:03,120
have been watching this whole time, Jamie's Tumblr, to read about what happened in New York

1969
02:50:03,120 --> 02:50:11,360
Comic-Con. My eyes just rolled so far in the back of my head, I can see my brain. I'm infuriated by

1970
02:50:11,360 --> 02:50:19,040
it. It's just like, I can't. I can't. That's all I can say. I can't believe. I still see how people

1971
02:50:19,040 --> 02:50:23,520
can think that doing something like that is okay. Here's the thing is that somebody in a room

1972
02:50:24,240 --> 02:50:29,520
said, and just if you guys don't know, this cosplayer, again, I'm totally reeling.

1973
02:50:29,520 --> 02:50:31,280
We're gonna leave the bulk of the story for Ranma.

1974
02:50:31,280 --> 02:50:38,880
Yes, we will. This cosplayer that was at the convention was basically sexually harassed

1975
02:50:38,880 --> 02:50:44,080
by this television crew that was trying to film her boobs and things like this. Just really stupid

1976
02:50:44,080 --> 02:50:49,600
shit. But the thing that gets me is that I'm like, somebody sat in a room and said, this is a good

1977
02:50:49,600 --> 02:50:53,360
idea. And for the record, this is why we still need feminism.

1978
02:50:53,520 --> 02:50:56,880
This is why we need common sense.

1979
02:50:58,080 --> 02:51:02,880
And Rob, multiple reports came up about that group right after this popped up.

1980
02:51:04,560 --> 02:51:07,760
And now they're playing chicken saying, well, we're not ever going to go back again.

1981
02:51:07,760 --> 02:51:08,960
They shouldn't exist.

1982
02:51:10,480 --> 02:51:16,800
That's a little, all right. I will keep my mouth shut and let you have the say,

1983
02:51:16,800 --> 02:51:18,240
Tuesday's on my jam session.

1984
02:51:18,240 --> 02:51:22,960
I would love to rant if I didn't have school on Tuesday. I would love to call in and rant.

1985
02:51:23,040 --> 02:51:24,960
You might need to do a pre-taped segment or something.

1986
02:51:25,520 --> 02:51:28,640
You are more than welcome to write up an article for my site if you'd like.

1987
02:51:29,600 --> 02:51:30,000
We'll see.

1988
02:51:30,560 --> 02:51:31,060
All right.

1989
02:51:32,320 --> 02:51:36,560
But let's get back on track here and I'll make this part brief and I'll get out of here.

1990
02:51:36,560 --> 02:51:41,840
Because one thing I have noticed on Saturday, outside of Nintendo,

1991
02:51:42,640 --> 02:51:45,120
no one really cared about gaming at Comic-Con.

1992
02:51:46,880 --> 02:51:51,680
How so? Like people just weren't lining up for it or news wasn't really coming out about it or?

1993
02:51:51,680 --> 02:51:53,360
Nobody was really lining up.

1994
02:51:53,360 --> 02:51:59,040
Capcom had a booth where they had six Strider, uh, displays, uh, DuckTales remastered,

1995
02:51:59,040 --> 02:52:00,960
Monster Hunter, Phoenix Wright.

1996
02:52:00,960 --> 02:52:04,960
Evidently there was still more people lining up to play, uh, DuckTales than it was for Strider.

1997
02:52:05,520 --> 02:52:09,040
Oh, that's, that's, oh my gosh.

1998
02:52:11,040 --> 02:52:17,360
That's, I, I, uh, again, I'm just, uh, I mean, that doesn't make me sad in the same way.

1999
02:52:17,360 --> 02:52:21,680
The other thing made me sad, but it's just like, I just, I, I weep that, uh, Strider,

2000
02:52:21,680 --> 02:52:24,880
no one cares. I, I really hope the sales don't reflect that.

2001
02:52:25,680 --> 02:52:30,960
I, I doubt it, but also everybody was going nuts at the Ubisoft, uh, display because,

2002
02:52:30,960 --> 02:52:33,600
um, they had Just Dance 2014 out.

2003
02:52:36,240 --> 02:52:36,880
Oh boy.

2004
02:52:37,680 --> 02:52:41,680
And I just noticed like while I was recording footage of people dancing, they had some,

2005
02:52:41,680 --> 02:52:45,040
I think a pinball, PC pinball gaming contest going on.

2006
02:52:45,040 --> 02:52:49,040
This girl won and walked away with a high-end Nvidia PC, and I thought that was pretty cool.

2007
02:52:49,040 --> 02:52:54,080
Nice. I think it's pretty cool. There's an ABBA song in Just Dance 2014, just saying.

2008
02:52:54,080 --> 02:53:00,080
All right, Rama, we got to let you go as we can wrap up the show, but, uh, tune into anime jam

2009
02:53:00,080 --> 02:53:04,800
session Tuesday at 6 30 Pacific, 9 30 Eastern right after Electric Sisterhood here in VOG.

2010
02:53:05,440 --> 02:53:06,160
Got that right.

2011
02:53:06,160 --> 02:53:07,360
All right. Take care, buddy.

2012
02:53:07,360 --> 02:53:07,920
All right. You too.

2013
02:53:07,920 --> 02:53:08,400
All right. Bye.

2014
02:53:08,960 --> 02:53:09,520
Bye.

2015
02:53:09,520 --> 02:53:15,280
Sadly, I am going to close up the Skype line so, uh, we can, uh, finish up the show.

2016
02:53:15,280 --> 02:53:17,280
I'm so sorry to those that didn't get through.

2017
02:53:17,280 --> 02:53:20,960
Uh, you can always email us mailbag at orange lounge, radio.com,

2018
02:53:20,960 --> 02:53:22,960
but I still have a few tweets to get through.

2019
02:53:22,960 --> 02:53:26,080
And I don't know if Loki has any last minute stories, but we'll give him a chance to.

2020
02:53:26,720 --> 02:53:29,760
All right, then let's get to the Twitters as soon as I can bring it up.

2021
02:53:29,760 --> 02:53:30,080
All right.

2022
02:53:30,080 --> 02:53:36,160
So Bobby linked us to this article that, uh, says because we all love lists and it was

2023
02:53:36,160 --> 02:53:43,280
literally a list of Game of Thrones characters as video game consoles.

2024
02:53:43,280 --> 02:53:46,080
Now I don't watch Game of Thrones, so I kind of looked at the list going.

2025
02:53:46,080 --> 02:53:47,360
It doesn't make sense to me.

2026
02:53:47,360 --> 02:53:50,880
Um, but it just seems like the type of thing that they're intentionally baiting people

2027
02:53:50,880 --> 02:53:51,920
to share on Facebook.

2028
02:53:52,480 --> 02:53:57,600
Um, which is kind of what some of the internet's turned into and some of what Facebook's turned

2029
02:53:57,600 --> 02:53:58,000
into.

2030
02:53:58,000 --> 02:53:58,640
And I don't know.

2031
02:54:00,000 --> 02:54:03,040
I want to talk about this tweet from ActDeft because I heard about this too.

2032
02:54:03,040 --> 02:54:07,520
ActDeft tweets us saying, I just learned about the existence of a 3DS version of Chocobo

2033
02:54:07,520 --> 02:54:09,760
Racing and sadly it got canned.

2034
02:54:09,760 --> 02:54:12,480
I, I did forget they did announce this.

2035
02:54:12,480 --> 02:54:16,240
Like when the 3DS first came out, they were like, yeah, we're going to make a Chocobo

2036
02:54:16,240 --> 02:54:17,280
Racing game for it.

2037
02:54:17,280 --> 02:54:19,440
Well, it came out this week that that game got canceled.

2038
02:54:20,400 --> 02:54:24,320
And I'm like, oh, I really liked the PlayStation game.

2039
02:54:24,320 --> 02:54:30,080
I know it kind of got mixed reviews and some people didn't feel so hot on the game, but

2040
02:54:30,080 --> 02:54:32,160
I thought the game was really cool.

2041
02:54:32,160 --> 02:54:35,360
So I'm sad they didn't do Chocobo Racing on 3DS.

2042
02:54:35,360 --> 02:54:38,640
I would have enjoyed it, but I guess I'll never get to play it.

2043
02:54:38,640 --> 02:54:39,280
Sniff, sniff.

2044
02:54:40,320 --> 02:54:46,720
Uh, let's see, uh, Tiger Claw sends us a link here and I will read this here.

2045
02:54:46,720 --> 02:54:49,760
Russian government to fund patriotic games.

2046
02:54:51,120 --> 02:54:51,600
Interesting.

2047
02:54:51,600 --> 02:54:57,360
I'm trying to look at this article cause I haven't heard about this, but, uh, let's see.

2048
02:54:57,440 --> 02:55:03,840
He links us to an article at GameSpot.com that says, uh, Russians, Russia's culture

2049
02:55:03,840 --> 02:55:07,920
minister says video games have to be conducive to patriotic education.

2050
02:55:07,920 --> 02:55:10,480
And if you distort history, you could be banned.

2051
02:55:11,360 --> 02:55:14,160
It will help fund the production of patriotic games.

2052
02:55:15,520 --> 02:55:20,480
And it's, uh, comments from, uh, the aid to Russia's culture minister, Vladimir

2053
02:55:20,480 --> 02:55:24,480
Mandinsky said in an interview with a Russian daily newspaper.

2054
02:55:25,280 --> 02:55:30,080
And, um, there are several developers that they're in talks with for games to be released

2055
02:55:30,080 --> 02:55:31,440
through 2014.

2056
02:55:31,440 --> 02:55:36,400
You know, this is interesting because you might think, Oh, government funded video

2057
02:55:36,400 --> 02:55:36,800
games.

2058
02:55:36,800 --> 02:55:38,480
What a crazy idea.

2059
02:55:38,480 --> 02:55:39,040
Not really.

2060
02:55:39,040 --> 02:55:42,480
Cause weren't we just hearing on Bobby Blackwell show a couple of weeks ago, he was

2061
02:55:42,480 --> 02:55:44,480
out there at the CDC game jam.

2062
02:55:44,480 --> 02:55:48,560
I mean, the CDC is a government arm, so, you know, obviously it wasn't necessarily

2063
02:55:48,560 --> 02:55:49,840
funding patriotic games.

2064
02:55:49,840 --> 02:55:55,520
It was funding, you know, awareness of, uh, you know, but I just, I thought it was

2065
02:55:55,520 --> 02:56:00,880
interesting that, uh, there's patriotic games of a different sense, uh, being made

2066
02:56:00,880 --> 02:56:01,120
here.

2067
02:56:02,240 --> 02:56:04,560
Um, let's see if there's any other tweets here.

2068
02:56:04,560 --> 02:56:09,040
I'll read this very kind tweet from a Soutour who says, uh, OLR helps me face the

2069
02:56:09,040 --> 02:56:10,080
week each Sunday.

2070
02:56:10,640 --> 02:56:11,920
Oh, thank you.

2071
02:56:13,520 --> 02:56:14,240
So there you go.

2072
02:56:15,120 --> 02:56:17,360
Uh, and then we also got tweeted this picture.

2073
02:56:17,360 --> 02:56:19,200
I just want to show this dark Sakura.

2074
02:56:19,280 --> 02:56:20,640
It's a from what?

2075
02:56:20,640 --> 02:56:21,040
Sorry.

2076
02:56:21,040 --> 02:56:24,800
Morning Wolf is the name of this tweeter who sent us a picture saying gamer cat

2077
02:56:24,800 --> 02:56:26,960
approves of the classic game of the week.

2078
02:56:26,960 --> 02:56:31,600
And there's gamer cat, uh, curled up next to a copy of the animal crossing strategy

2079
02:56:31,600 --> 02:56:31,840
guide.

2080
02:56:31,840 --> 02:56:34,320
Cause that was last week's classic game of the week.

2081
02:56:35,280 --> 02:56:41,920
We like it when you tweet us your cats and, uh, I think that'll do it for, we

2082
02:56:41,920 --> 02:56:43,840
should have, we should have something.

2083
02:56:43,840 --> 02:56:48,160
I'm going to start this on the orange lounge tumbler called show us your pussy.

2084
02:56:50,000 --> 02:56:51,200
I want pictures of cats.

2085
02:56:52,080 --> 02:56:54,560
Well, those are, there's already a shit ton of those on tumbler.

2086
02:56:54,560 --> 02:56:55,200
What do you have?

2087
02:56:55,200 --> 02:56:56,880
My favorite is get out of there cat.

2088
02:56:57,920 --> 02:56:58,320
All right.

2089
02:56:58,960 --> 02:57:00,240
That's it for Twitter topics.

2090
02:57:00,240 --> 02:57:02,560
So that's going to do it for our show tonight.

2091
02:57:02,560 --> 02:57:03,920

Thank you.

2109
02:57:41,360 --> 02:57:43,200
I knew there was something I was forgetting in housekeeping.

2110
02:57:43,920 --> 02:57:47,200
If you did make it this far in the show, then hopefully you did really like what

2111
02:57:47,200 --> 02:57:47,840
you hear.

2112
02:57:47,840 --> 02:57:50,000
Uh, the nominations are about to close.

2113
02:57:50,000 --> 02:57:54,800

2114
02:57:54,800 --> 02:57:57,440
So if you're listening live right now and you haven't done it yet, please

2115
02:57:57,440 --> 02:58:01,360
considering going, please consider going to podcast words.com and nominating

2116
02:58:01,360 --> 02:58:04,640
orange launch radio for people's choice and best gaming.

2117
02:58:04,640 --> 02:58:07,600
And if you don't know what to put for the URL, just put orange launch radio.com.

2118
02:58:07,600 --> 02:58:08,880
They'll, they'll, they'll figure it out.

2119
02:58:08,880 --> 02:58:09,920
We've been nominated before.

2120
02:58:09,920 --> 02:58:14,080
They know we know they know who we are and, uh, yeah, we just, it really helps

2121
02:58:14,080 --> 02:58:15,120
us spread awareness.

2122
02:58:15,120 --> 02:58:17,360
That whole thing I just talked about before, you know, getting the word of

2123
02:58:17,360 --> 02:58:18,320
mouth out there.

2124
02:58:18,320 --> 02:58:20,080
So, uh, yeah, would really appreciate it.

2125
02:58:20,080 --> 02:58:22,720
But if you decide to nominate somebody else, that's cool too.

2126
02:58:22,720 --> 02:58:23,680
Just keep it independent.

2127
02:58:23,680 --> 02:58:24,240
That's all we ask.

2128
02:58:24,240 --> 02:58:25,200
Keep it independent.

2129
02:58:25,200 --> 02:58:27,280
Independence are the ones that need the exposure.

2130
02:58:27,280 --> 02:58:28,960
So, uh, good luck to everybody.

2131
02:58:29,600 --> 02:58:31,120
Um, that's it.

2132
02:58:31,120 --> 02:58:33,760
I guess we'll go around and get everybody's final thought for the night

2133
02:58:33,760 --> 02:58:34,960
and then wrap up and get out of here.

2134
02:58:35,520 --> 02:58:38,080
I will give my final thought thought first tonight.

2135
02:58:38,080 --> 02:58:41,760
And my final thought is I'm going to try very hard the rest of this evening

2136
02:58:41,760 --> 02:58:44,880
to not talk, but doing this show makes me happy.

2137
02:58:44,880 --> 02:58:48,080
And I'm glad I could push through these past few hours to be here with you

2138
02:58:48,080 --> 02:58:48,880
tonight.

2139
02:58:48,880 --> 02:58:51,040
Uh, Loki, your final thought tonight?

2140
02:58:51,040 --> 02:58:53,120
I have plenty of lots of Grand Theft Auto 5 this week.

2141
02:58:53,120 --> 02:58:58,480
And stay tuned to the forums, uh, cause we'll have an exact time and day for

2142
02:58:58,480 --> 02:59:01,520
those VOG gaming nights for Grand Theft Auto online.

2143
02:59:01,520 --> 02:59:05,120
It's might be in the middle of the week now, but we'll see.

2144
02:59:05,760 --> 02:59:06,560
All right.

2145
02:59:06,560 --> 02:59:07,680
You gotta figure that out.

2146
02:59:07,680 --> 02:59:10,080
And last but not least, Dark Soccer, your final thought.

2147
02:59:10,720 --> 02:59:11,680
I'm very grumpy.

2148
02:59:13,120 --> 02:59:13,840
Sorry to hear it.

2149
02:59:14,400 --> 02:59:14,960
All right.

2150
02:59:14,960 --> 02:59:16,320
Uh, that's it guys.

2151
02:59:16,320 --> 02:59:18,000
We're done here at Orange Lounge Radio.

2152
02:59:18,000 --> 02:59:20,800
We will be back next week to do it all again.

2153
02:59:20,800 --> 02:59:25,680
I have a wonderful week in the meantime and, um, keep on gaming and have fun.

2154
02:59:25,680 --> 02:59:25,920
