1
00:00:14,043 --> 00:00:17,048
[SPEAKER_06]: This week, Microsoft denies that Kinect gathers data for advertising.

2
00:00:17,328 --> 00:00:24,438
[SPEAKER_06]: A classic RPG series is headed to iOS and Android, and tonight we interview SoCal Mike Kennedy about Retro Magazine and its Kickstarter campaign.

3
00:00:24,758 --> 00:00:26,421
[SPEAKER_06]: All this and more begins right now.

4
00:00:31,806 --> 00:00:36,669
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

5
00:00:36,749 --> 00:00:46,734
[SPEAKER_05]: This is Orange Lounge Radio here on October the 13th, 2013 with episode number 523 of our program.

6
00:00:47,154 --> 00:00:53,237
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Rob Roberts, joining you over the next few hours to talk about video games, gaming culture, and so on and so on with my co-hosts.

7
00:00:53,658 --> 00:00:56,419
[SPEAKER_05]: Say hello first off to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

8
00:00:56,479 --> 00:00:58,880
[SPEAKER_03]: I just thought you were channeling Bea Arthur like you said earlier.

9
00:00:59,020 --> 00:00:59,960
[SPEAKER_05]: I am a little bit.

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,081
[SPEAKER_05]: I have the raspy voice going on today.

11
00:01:04,061 --> 00:01:13,084
[SPEAKER_05]: Those of you that follow VOG Network know that Jessica from Understation Live and I were both involved with a production here in Sacramento at the Rocky Horror Picture Show.

12
00:01:13,584 --> 00:01:16,865
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that occurred last night and I'm proud to say we sold out.

13
00:01:17,045 --> 00:01:20,466
[SPEAKER_05]: It was 500 plus seats and the cast did an amazing job.

14
00:01:20,846 --> 00:01:25,667
[SPEAKER_05]: But I was the host or MC hosting the whole thing and that involved a lot of screaming.

15
00:01:26,167 --> 00:01:50,010
[SPEAKER_05]: MC Rob, give me an R, give me an R, you know the whole thing at the top of my voice and you know trying to be funny improv and all that but it was great and I will say by missing the show you missed this really I can't even repeat it but it had to do with Pokemon that's all I'm gonna say let's just say I probably keep in mind that the shows that I've had the most fun at were the ones where I did crew stuff

16
00:01:50,774 --> 00:01:51,474
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah, yeah.

17
00:01:51,494 --> 00:01:53,435
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember you used to do tech-related things.

18
00:01:53,455 --> 00:01:54,975
[SPEAKER_05]: Didn't you play Dr. Scott one time?

19
00:01:55,136 --> 00:01:56,316
[SPEAKER_01]: I was Dr. Scott one time.

20
00:01:57,276 --> 00:02:00,817
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was the curtain and the rope, and I held the tank up.

21
00:02:01,918 --> 00:02:03,158
[SPEAKER_05]: Last night, I played Dr. Scott.

22
00:02:03,178 --> 00:02:03,839
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually played Eddie.

23
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:08,840
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the first time I played Eddie for about... Oh, God, it's probably been like 12 years since I played Eddie.

24
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:11,361
[SPEAKER_05]: But, yeah, good old meatloaf.

25
00:02:11,941 --> 00:02:12,241
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

26
00:02:12,562 --> 00:02:12,842
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

27
00:02:13,022 --> 00:02:19,104
[SPEAKER_01]: But I still think it's ironic that in the original production that he was Dr. Scott and not...

28
00:02:20,044 --> 00:02:20,585
[SPEAKER_05]: He was both.

29
00:02:20,846 --> 00:02:27,835
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, he was both at one point, and that's why a lot of movie shadow casts will do both, especially if they're stretched for people like we were.

30
00:02:28,836 --> 00:02:36,387
[SPEAKER_01]: But no, I have more fun when I'm not looking at the crowd when they're behind me, and I'm not looking at a sea of people.

31
00:02:36,867 --> 00:02:38,408
[SPEAKER_05]: See, the crowd thing doesn't bother me at all.

32
00:02:38,428 --> 00:02:42,269
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just, I guess that's just part of my, like, you know, how I'm wired.

33
00:02:42,349 --> 00:02:44,190
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, you know, I'm able to do, well, this is easy.

34
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:45,130
[SPEAKER_01]: You are an attention whore.

35
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:49,292
[SPEAKER_05]: This is easy because we don't, yeah, but you make it sound like I'm like self-centered or something like that too.

36
00:02:49,332 --> 00:02:50,373
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really like to think I'm not.

37
00:02:50,413 --> 00:02:53,454
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people are fine with the public speaking thing.

38
00:02:53,894 --> 00:02:59,596
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not that I have a problem with public speaking, although I actually have a pathological fear of microphones and public speaking.

39
00:02:59,796 --> 00:03:00,437
[SPEAKER_05]: Yet here you are.

40
00:03:00,937 --> 00:03:04,058
[SPEAKER_01]: No, microphones and public speaking as in in front of a crowd with a microphone.

41
00:03:04,118 --> 00:03:04,458
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

42
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:06,339
[SPEAKER_01]: I hate the way my voice sounds amplified.

43
00:03:07,432 --> 00:03:08,713
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, hearing the echo and all that.

44
00:03:08,913 --> 00:03:09,333
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

45
00:03:09,653 --> 00:03:11,934
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even like listening to myself in recordings.

46
00:03:13,114 --> 00:03:15,495
[SPEAKER_01]: So I actually have to practice modulating my voice.

47
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:19,416
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, my voice is definitely being modulated tonight.

48
00:03:19,876 --> 00:03:26,238
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm running on four hours of sleep because apparently the insomnia creature decided to bitch slap me.

49
00:03:27,118 --> 00:03:28,399
[SPEAKER_01]: And I woke up at like...

50
00:03:29,778 --> 00:03:30,258
[SPEAKER_01]: TechmasterLoki

51
00:03:50,223 --> 00:03:50,503
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

52
00:03:50,703 --> 00:03:51,564
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, how you doing, Loki?

53
00:03:51,764 --> 00:03:52,364
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm doing alright.

54
00:03:52,464 --> 00:03:52,785
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah?

55
00:03:52,925 --> 00:03:55,026
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you do any theater productions this weekend?

56
00:03:55,727 --> 00:03:57,067
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you ever been involved with theater?

57
00:03:57,508 --> 00:03:59,629
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't really strike me as the type, but maybe like in high school.

58
00:03:59,649 --> 00:04:02,771
[SPEAKER_02]: Aside from like a drama class in high school, no.

59
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:03,371
[SPEAKER_02]: Not really.

60
00:04:03,651 --> 00:04:04,892
[SPEAKER_05]: I had to choose in high school.

61
00:04:04,952 --> 00:04:07,033
[SPEAKER_05]: I could take drama or I could take band.

62
00:04:07,814 --> 00:04:19,001
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm gonna be honest, I felt kind of guilted by my parents into doing band because it was like, Oh, Rob, your dead grandpa left you this clarinet and, you know, he would be really proud of you if you would go into band.

63
00:04:19,021 --> 00:04:19,101
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

64
00:04:19,321 --> 00:04:20,662
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob, butt, butt, band nerd represent I played clarinet

65
00:04:41,096 --> 00:04:58,256
[SPEAKER_05]: but I if I was left to the choice it's not what I would have picked but I don't regret it at all the only thing that's kind of sad about it is that since I graduated high school I have not touched the clarinet at all I have not played the clarinet since the day I was 18 and graduated high school

66
00:04:58,376 --> 00:04:59,817
[SPEAKER_01]: I told you what happened to my saxophone, didn't I?

67
00:05:00,037 --> 00:05:00,237
[SPEAKER_05]: Mm-mm.

68
00:05:00,698 --> 00:05:05,141
[SPEAKER_01]: It was in, when I moved out here, I had to leave it behind, so I loaned it to my friend who was a music major.

69
00:05:05,301 --> 00:05:05,541
[SPEAKER_01]: Really?

70
00:05:05,661 --> 00:05:07,242
[SPEAKER_01]: So she could take the saxophone class.

71
00:05:07,362 --> 00:05:07,562
[SPEAKER_01]: Mm-hmm.

72
00:05:08,062 --> 00:05:13,826
[SPEAKER_01]: And, because I played saxophone, I played contralto clarinet, I played alto clarinet, I played damn near everything that was saxophone or clarinet.

73
00:05:13,986 --> 00:05:14,187
[SPEAKER_01]: Mm-hmm.

74
00:05:14,747 --> 00:05:21,091
[SPEAKER_01]: And she left it, when she moved to Germany, she left it in her mother's attic in Diberville, Mississippi.

75
00:05:21,111 --> 00:05:21,672
[SPEAKER_01]: Mm-hmm.

76
00:05:21,692 --> 00:05:24,113
[SPEAKER_01]: And then this hurricane named Katrina came in and stole her roof.

77
00:05:24,353 --> 00:05:24,654
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh.

78
00:05:24,914 --> 00:05:25,834
[SPEAKER_01]: And my saxophone.

79
00:05:26,095 --> 00:05:27,135
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, not good.

80
00:05:27,215 --> 00:05:27,596
[SPEAKER_01]: The end.

81
00:05:27,936 --> 00:05:28,216
[SPEAKER_05]: Not good.

82
00:05:28,636 --> 00:05:29,457
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, how about that?

83
00:05:29,517 --> 00:05:31,699
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki was trying to talk about his life and we made it about us.

84
00:05:32,119 --> 00:05:35,142
[SPEAKER_05]: How representative of Orange Lounge Radio.

85
00:05:35,803 --> 00:05:47,473
[SPEAKER_02]: The only way I'd ever want to learn to play the saxophone is just, and really only just a small part would be just to learn how to play the chord for Epic Sax Man and just do that.

86
00:05:47,493 --> 00:05:49,295
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that's all you really need to know anyways.

87
00:05:49,395 --> 00:05:50,756
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's it.

88
00:05:51,550 --> 00:06:00,502
[SPEAKER_01]: I did, by the way, find a video clip on Tumblr of a guy going in shirtless on a skateboard playing Careless Whisper on a saxophone.

89
00:06:01,223 --> 00:06:01,543
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.

90
00:06:02,404 --> 00:06:07,451
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, going to our chat room because, you know, we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.

91
00:06:07,811 --> 00:06:10,433
[SPEAKER_05]: at the voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.

92
00:06:10,713 --> 00:06:15,095
[SPEAKER_05]: We are live right after the Bobby Blackwolf show, and we love interacting with our listeners.

93
00:06:15,155 --> 00:06:27,822
[SPEAKER_05]: We do call it the show where every gamer has a voice, and Ragenator, using his voice to poke fun a little bit, saying, but Sky, did you go to Bandcamp and tell stories that began with this one time at Bandcamp?

94
00:06:29,202 --> 00:06:35,465
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so, I mean, that movie really just, like, worked that line to death.

95
00:06:35,565 --> 00:06:39,407
[SPEAKER_05]: But Bandcamp is a real thing, for those of you that didn't do Bandcamp.

96
00:06:39,427 --> 00:06:40,788
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not like that.

97
00:06:40,908 --> 00:06:42,829
[SPEAKER_05]: No, well, okay.

98
00:06:42,849 --> 00:06:44,149
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no, no, no.

99
00:06:44,269 --> 00:06:45,470
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't have a camp.

100
00:06:46,263 --> 00:06:48,026
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we didn't like go off into the woods or anything.

101
00:06:48,066 --> 00:06:52,913
[SPEAKER_05]: It was go to school for eight hours a day so you can get a jump on learning your field show.

102
00:06:52,933 --> 00:06:54,175
[SPEAKER_01]: And memorize your music.

103
00:06:54,836 --> 00:07:01,145
[SPEAKER_01]: And for me in Alabama, it's march in the humid with mosquitoes and lose your shoes in the swamp that we had to practice in.

104
00:07:02,306 --> 00:07:04,228
[SPEAKER_05]: We would stay overnight one of the nights.

105
00:07:04,328 --> 00:07:13,356
[SPEAKER_05]: It would usually be a Friday, Saturday, Sunday and we would stay overnight at the school on a Saturday and sleep in the gymnasium because we were supposed to be learning about what it's like when the band goes out on tour.

106
00:07:13,856 --> 00:07:21,603
[SPEAKER_05]: Mind you, we did the overnight thing on tour once my junior year and we stayed in a Motel 6 or whatever the Canadian version of Motel 6 is.

107
00:07:21,683 --> 00:07:23,745
[SPEAKER_05]: Some, you know, Maple Room 6.

108
00:07:24,065 --> 00:07:24,585
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm kidding.

109
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:25,726
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what it was called up there.

110
00:07:25,746 --> 00:07:27,608
[SPEAKER_05]: Some discount chain in Canada is where we stayed, right?

111
00:07:27,628 --> 00:07:28,429
[SPEAKER_03]: We never did that shit.

112
00:07:28,769 --> 00:07:30,530
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, okay, but here's the thing.

113
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:37,353
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, at band camp, you put a bunch of, like, horny-ass teenagers in high school together in a group and have them staying overnight.

114
00:07:38,054 --> 00:07:42,536
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, some dumb things, dumb, stupid teenager things are gonna happen, and yes, there were games of truth.

115
00:07:42,556 --> 00:07:43,437
[SPEAKER_05]: That goes for all camp, too.

116
00:07:43,457 --> 00:07:43,937
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, seriously.

117
00:07:43,957 --> 00:07:45,277
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I mean, exactly.

118
00:07:45,317 --> 00:07:46,798
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not unique to band.

119
00:07:46,818 --> 00:07:51,741
[SPEAKER_05]: That's any mixed-gender camp, or really, same-gender camp, too, so...

120
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:53,930
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura and I, big old band nerds.

121
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:55,991
[SPEAKER_01]: What kind of kid were you in high school, Logie?

122
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:19,090
[SPEAKER_02]: In high school?

123
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:19,730
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

124
00:08:20,151 --> 00:08:22,491
[SPEAKER_02]: I do pretty much the same stuff in high school I do now.

125
00:08:23,111 --> 00:08:23,571
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously.

126
00:08:23,792 --> 00:08:24,892
[SPEAKER_02]: Except now you have a wife and kid.

127
00:08:25,452 --> 00:08:25,932
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

128
00:08:26,012 --> 00:08:27,073
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, let's see.

129
00:08:27,153 --> 00:08:33,594
[SPEAKER_02]: In high school, well, I took art all four years in high school, and then one year I took drama as well.

130
00:08:34,435 --> 00:08:35,875
[SPEAKER_02]: But let's see.

131
00:08:35,935 --> 00:08:43,337
[SPEAKER_02]: My art class, like, at one point I actually had a free period, so I ended up going into my art class and landing the PCs together and playing games on that.

132
00:08:43,537 --> 00:08:45,578
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, it was Red Alert or Duke Nukem 3D.

133
00:08:46,518 --> 00:09:08,431
[SPEAKER_02]: and then um I used to bring my PlayStation 1 to uh that was actually I think I got my PlayStation 197 oh my god I feel old and so um yeah I used to bring that to school and you play during lunch and I still do that now I bring my systems to work and I play during lunch

134
00:09:09,251 --> 00:09:10,512
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

135
00:09:30,311 --> 00:09:31,272
[SPEAKER_05]: Tank Wars, VGA, Scorched Earth

136
00:09:48,108 --> 00:09:51,390
[SPEAKER_05]: Worms is kind of like taking a bite out of that same genre, like Scorched Earth and all that.

137
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:56,574
[SPEAKER_05]: But for me, nothing will ever match the mega nuke in Scorched Earth.

138
00:09:56,774 --> 00:10:01,137
[SPEAKER_05]: That was always fun to watch one of your friends fire that thing off and swallow up seven tanks whole.

139
00:10:01,897 --> 00:10:04,259
[SPEAKER_05]: See, you're like... I think you and I would have been buds.

140
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:13,866
[SPEAKER_01]: My senior year of high school, we had someone bring one of those generator-powered TVs and a Super Nintendo because that's what was new at the time.

141
00:10:14,366 --> 00:10:15,547
[SPEAKER_01]: It was Super Nintendo.

142
00:10:15,567 --> 00:10:15,647
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

143
00:10:17,442 --> 00:10:19,724
[SPEAKER_05]: And... Okay, Grandma, tell us more stories.

144
00:10:20,324 --> 00:10:29,471
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was when I moved into the dorm, because I was the only one in our block that had a TV in the dorm room, that my roommate's boyfriend left his PlayStation over.

145
00:10:30,092 --> 00:10:32,894
[SPEAKER_01]: We played a lot of Toshinden, and my room was very popular.

146
00:10:33,334 --> 00:10:36,176
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, in college... We also watched a lot of Sailor Moon.

147
00:10:36,356 --> 00:10:41,380
[SPEAKER_05]: In college, I had a Super Nintendo with Super Mario Kart, and it's the only reason most of those kids wanted to talk to me.

148
00:10:42,301 --> 00:10:42,461
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

149
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:50,762
[SPEAKER_01]: I also had like VHS copies of like the entire run of Ronin Warriors on VHS because I stayed up to tape them every day.

150
00:10:50,963 --> 00:10:51,223
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.

151
00:10:51,563 --> 00:10:57,585
[SPEAKER_01]: So my room was like Anime Central and I had all of like I had Ranma Project fan subs.

152
00:10:57,665 --> 00:10:58,165
[SPEAKER_05]: That's awesome.

153
00:10:58,785 --> 00:11:01,206
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had an unsubbed copy of Rotsukidoji.

154
00:11:03,727 --> 00:11:05,807
[SPEAKER_01]: So we would make up our own dialogue to it.

155
00:11:07,788 --> 00:11:08,489
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

156
00:11:37,948 --> 00:11:40,632
[SPEAKER_05]: Just names out there in the industry to kind of freelance for this.

157
00:11:40,712 --> 00:11:44,157
[SPEAKER_05]: So excited to talk to Mike about that project.

158
00:11:44,177 --> 00:11:45,959
[SPEAKER_05]: And that'll be in about 10 minutes here live.

159
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:50,365
[SPEAKER_05]: If you do want to join us in our chat room, live.vognetwork.com is the place to be.

160
00:11:51,026 --> 00:11:54,651
[SPEAKER_05]: Before I get into gaming weeks, I had another kickoff topic I wanted to talk about quickly.

161
00:11:55,792 --> 00:12:06,275
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanted to talk about loaning games out and experiences that you guys have had with loaning out games and loaning out systems and maybe the good or the bad experience because I have a really funny story.

162
00:12:06,955 --> 00:12:13,016
[SPEAKER_05]: The listeners may not be aware of this, but somebody from Orange Lounge Radio has passed from the first few years of the show.

163
00:12:13,376 --> 00:12:17,677
[SPEAKER_05]: You might remember a gal who used to come on the show an awful lot named Rice Princess.

164
00:12:18,417 --> 00:12:24,839
[SPEAKER_05]: Back when Orange Lounge Radio was a station way back in the day on Life 365, I co-hosted a show with her called Outside the Box.

165
00:12:25,479 --> 00:12:29,382
[SPEAKER_05]: And now she just goes by Princess Irene, I believe, is like her new preferred handle.

166
00:12:29,902 --> 00:12:41,069
[SPEAKER_05]: Princess Irene got married on Thursday, and her and Silent Nathan, another name from the past, they got married finally this past week.

167
00:12:41,129 --> 00:12:48,113
[SPEAKER_05]: So congratulations and our well wishes to them, and I'm sure many of the listeners, especially the old school ones when they hear those names, will be excited to hear that they got hitched.

168
00:12:48,533 --> 00:12:49,093
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, guess what?

169
00:12:49,453 --> 00:12:52,374
[SPEAKER_05]: Princess Irene went on a honeymoon to Japan.

170
00:12:52,814 --> 00:12:54,895
[SPEAKER_05]: Perfect nerd honeymoon with her new husband, right?

171
00:12:55,015 --> 00:12:55,875
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, man, I'm jealous.

172
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:56,415
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, right?

173
00:12:56,475 --> 00:12:57,275
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm kind of jealous, too.

174
00:12:57,635 --> 00:13:00,636
[SPEAKER_05]: So they went to Japan, and she actually asked me.

175
00:13:00,676 --> 00:13:06,217
[SPEAKER_05]: She said, hey, Rob, remember a long time ago you said I could borrow your 3DS to play Animal Crossing at some point?

176
00:13:06,277 --> 00:13:08,358
[SPEAKER_05]: She's like, would it be possible to do that now?

177
00:13:08,418 --> 00:13:12,159
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I got a 12-hour flight to Japan, and that would be a great way to pass the time.

178
00:13:12,179 --> 00:13:13,059
[SPEAKER_05]: And I said, oh, sure.

179
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:15,579
[SPEAKER_05]: So she came over Wednesday night.

180
00:13:15,619 --> 00:13:16,400
[SPEAKER_05]: We caught up a little bit.

181
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,000
[SPEAKER_05]: I gave her my 3DS, and on she went.

182
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:18,560
[SPEAKER_05]: Or 2DS.

183
00:13:43,935 --> 00:13:44,816
[SPEAKER_05]: Or 2DS.

184
00:13:44,856 --> 00:13:47,038
[SPEAKER_05]: He actually said, yeah, 2DS would be a good idea too.

185
00:13:47,358 --> 00:13:49,399
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like, Shane, that's money.

186
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:50,680
[SPEAKER_05]: That's like $180.

187
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:55,184
[SPEAKER_05]: We were talking like $20 maybe, but that's like a whole other system.

188
00:13:55,604 --> 00:14:01,348
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm currently having to sit and wait, and I'm missing the Pokemon boat because I loaned out my 3DS.

189
00:14:01,408 --> 00:14:09,694
[SPEAKER_05]: Now look, I don't regret it because Irene obviously loved her to bits, and if I can bring a little more entertainment to her honeymoon, then so be it.

190
00:14:10,115 --> 00:14:12,316
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's just kind of one of those things where I was like, don't.

191
00:14:13,217 --> 00:14:14,478
[SPEAKER_02]: That's too bad, but you know what?

192
00:14:15,299 --> 00:14:17,621
[SPEAKER_02]: You can turn this upside, or turn this back around.

193
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:21,285
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the Grand Theft Auto V ship has made port.

194
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:22,266
[SPEAKER_02]: And guess what?

195
00:14:22,887 --> 00:14:26,350
[SPEAKER_02]: It's available right now for you to go get and play.

196
00:14:27,611 --> 00:14:33,297
[SPEAKER_05]: So Salesman Loki is going to counter Salesman Shane by saying, hey, do you know for a third of the price...

197
00:14:33,829 --> 00:14:37,871
[SPEAKER_05]: of the 3DS, you could be playing Grand Theft Auto 5 in the VOG Club right now.

198
00:14:37,911 --> 00:14:38,291
[SPEAKER_01]: Or Rob.

199
00:14:38,671 --> 00:14:38,871
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

200
00:14:39,371 --> 00:14:42,232
[SPEAKER_01]: You could go the free route and play Borderlands 2 with me.

201
00:14:42,813 --> 00:14:44,694
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, play the games I already have, right?

202
00:14:44,754 --> 00:14:45,194
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

203
00:14:45,494 --> 00:14:46,754
[SPEAKER_01]: How about being frugal?

204
00:14:47,735 --> 00:14:49,876
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's hear it for fiscal responsibility.

205
00:14:51,553 --> 00:14:59,960
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, going to our chat room for some comments at live.vognetwork.com Bobby Blackwolf says, Irene deserves your 3DS more than you deserve Pokemon.

206
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:01,081
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, shut up.

207
00:15:01,861 --> 00:15:05,644
[SPEAKER_05]: Alpha Cananogram says, Sky, maybe she'll get you some Japanese street passes.

208
00:15:06,325 --> 00:15:15,332
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually told her because if there weren't chargers on the plane, I told her to turn the Wi-Fi off so that way she would save battery power would probably be the smart thing to do.

209
00:15:15,632 --> 00:15:18,314
[SPEAKER_05]: Do they even have the same plugs in Japan that we have here?

210
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:18,955
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

211
00:15:19,215 --> 00:15:19,996
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

212
00:15:38,554 --> 00:16:04,197
[SPEAKER_01]: if you haven't learned in the past 11 and a half years sometimes things come out of my mouth before I really think them through, DarkSakura the one who had to have the mod the little plug mod was Jessica because of her APS2 that had the different plug on it Bobby, I would totally have played Borderlands 2 with you I've had my character ready to go for the longest time and no one's been playing

213
00:16:04,662 --> 00:16:05,182
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, way to go

214
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,040
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

215
00:16:50,840 --> 00:17:10,852
[SPEAKER_01]: or you keep their stuff forever like my dance pad that you had for like a year it's fine if I really missed it I would ask for it back well it's like it's how I got my copy of Chrono Trigger my friend loaned it to me he moved to a Spanish fort and then I moved to California oops oops he hasn't asked for it back so it's fine didn't you get his save file is still on there

216
00:17:11,092 --> 00:17:11,332
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura,

217
00:17:32,287 --> 00:17:33,288
[SPEAKER_01]: We went to Anime Expo.

218
00:17:33,328 --> 00:17:35,689
[SPEAKER_01]: She owed us $100 for her part of the room and the trip.

219
00:17:36,449 --> 00:17:36,810
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay.

220
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:37,210
[SPEAKER_05]: It was an exchange.

221
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:38,991
[SPEAKER_01]: She went to Japan to go visit her family.

222
00:17:39,671 --> 00:17:41,092
[SPEAKER_01]: Came back with Dracula X for us.

223
00:17:42,072 --> 00:17:43,193
[SPEAKER_01]: She already had two copies.

224
00:17:43,493 --> 00:17:44,054
[SPEAKER_05]: Got it.

225
00:17:45,554 --> 00:17:46,755
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought that was like a loaning story.

226
00:17:46,795 --> 00:17:48,816
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, but that was exchanged for convention space.

227
00:17:48,876 --> 00:17:49,216
[SPEAKER_05]: I got you.

228
00:17:49,256 --> 00:17:50,337
[SPEAKER_03]: That was trade for goods.

229
00:17:50,817 --> 00:17:51,158
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

230
00:17:51,178 --> 00:17:54,679
[SPEAKER_02]: I loan out my games all the time and I forget I loan people stuff.

231
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,101
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now, I don't think I have anything loaned out, but...

232
00:17:58,533 --> 00:17:59,774
[SPEAKER_02]: I could very well.

233
00:17:59,894 --> 00:18:02,675
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I have another hilarious loaning somebody a game story.

234
00:18:02,735 --> 00:18:07,337
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so Flaco Jones, I think it was, and I'm sorry if I'm calling you out and it wasn't really you.

235
00:18:07,918 --> 00:18:11,319
[SPEAKER_05]: I loaned him a copy of Silent Hill 4 The Room on Xbox.

236
00:18:11,479 --> 00:18:12,380
[SPEAKER_05]: At least I think it was him.

237
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,641
[SPEAKER_05]: And it got passed back.

238
00:18:15,681 --> 00:18:16,842
[SPEAKER_05]: I know you had it for forever.

239
00:18:17,042 --> 00:18:17,762
[SPEAKER_01]: I had it for a while.

240
00:18:17,842 --> 00:18:20,164
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I loaned it to... I think it was Flog.

241
00:18:20,204 --> 00:18:21,324
[SPEAKER_05]: It might have been Extover, though.

242
00:18:21,345 --> 00:18:22,045
[SPEAKER_05]: It was one of them.

243
00:18:22,825 --> 00:18:27,768
[SPEAKER_05]: And they gave it back to Irene because they were like, well, Irene's going to see you next before I do.

244
00:18:28,329 --> 00:18:30,970
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, funny enough, when's the next time I see Irene?

245
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:32,631
[SPEAKER_05]: When we're all at a party.

246
00:18:33,472 --> 00:18:33,832
[SPEAKER_05]: And then...

247
00:18:34,532 --> 00:18:37,414
[SPEAKER_05]: They give me the game back and I'm like, yay, here's my game back.

248
00:18:37,454 --> 00:18:42,058
[SPEAKER_05]: I can go take this home and not play it because like my original Xbox is like in storage at this point.

249
00:18:42,098 --> 00:18:45,500
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't even, I mean, I guess it's backwards compatible on 360, but let's be real.

250
00:18:45,901 --> 00:18:49,243
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have like an anchoring to play Silent Hill 4 The Room anytime soon.

251
00:18:49,603 --> 00:18:50,544
[SPEAKER_05]: So what did I do, guys?

252
00:18:51,565 --> 00:18:53,386
[SPEAKER_05]: I left the game at the party.

253
00:18:53,586 --> 00:18:56,368
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't even bring it home.

254
00:18:57,089 --> 00:19:00,932
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm pretty sure that game has been sold by this point.

255
00:19:01,452 --> 00:19:02,613
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is funny.

256
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:04,374
[SPEAKER_03]: You can borrow mine if ever you want to play it.

257
00:19:05,115 --> 00:19:06,275
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that I actually have it.

258
00:19:07,096 --> 00:19:11,218
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't really like, like if I was going to go back and play a Silent Hill game, I think I'd go play 2 or 3.

259
00:19:11,899 --> 00:19:14,721
[SPEAKER_01]: I loaned actually my 3 to my friend Carly.

260
00:19:15,141 --> 00:19:16,902
[SPEAKER_01]: You remember, you've met Carly, haven't you?

261
00:19:17,523 --> 00:19:21,185
[SPEAKER_01]: The one who says the best rendition of the C-bomb ever.

262
00:19:21,805 --> 00:19:22,186
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my.

263
00:19:22,446 --> 00:19:24,567
[SPEAKER_01]: She makes it sound like it's fucking poetry.

264
00:19:25,608 --> 00:19:30,031
[SPEAKER_01]: But at any rate, she had my Silent Hill 3 for a long time and I think I have it back.

265
00:19:30,051 --> 00:19:30,551
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

266
00:19:32,734 --> 00:19:39,121
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, usually it's people that I will... Julie has borrowed stuff of mine and never given it back.

267
00:19:39,161 --> 00:19:40,322
[SPEAKER_01]: And then she'll say, oh, that was mine.

268
00:19:40,362 --> 00:19:40,682
[SPEAKER_01]: I bought that.

269
00:19:40,982 --> 00:19:41,883
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that was not yours.

270
00:19:41,983 --> 00:19:42,804
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the fucking receipt.

271
00:19:42,884 --> 00:19:45,247
[SPEAKER_05]: I like that you're calling people out here on the show.

272
00:19:45,647 --> 00:19:46,528
[SPEAKER_05]: She's not listening though, right?

273
00:19:46,568 --> 00:19:47,229
[SPEAKER_05]: No, she's not listening.

274
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:48,970
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura

275
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:18,464
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, well, I played Mass Effect 3 because Tiara started playing Mass Effect.

276
00:20:19,265 --> 00:20:20,806
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, oh, Mass Effect.

277
00:20:20,846 --> 00:20:24,229
[SPEAKER_01]: So I started playing and spent more time screen capping than playing the game.

278
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:28,393
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I played Animal Crossing.

279
00:20:28,413 --> 00:20:30,735
[SPEAKER_01]: I played a lot of Animal Crossing because I'm trying to get my tan back.

280
00:20:31,836 --> 00:20:31,976
[SPEAKER_01]: And...

281
00:20:33,933 --> 00:20:38,455
[SPEAKER_01]: I've played Fractal and I've played Final Fantasy XIV, which I still play at the same time so I can run dungeons.

282
00:20:39,236 --> 00:20:45,659
[SPEAKER_01]: And then a lot, a lot of Bejeweled on my phone.

283
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:46,880
[SPEAKER_05]: On your phone?

284
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:47,300
[SPEAKER_01]: On my phone.

285
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,721
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that the Blitz version where you try to do it?

286
00:20:48,741 --> 00:20:49,481
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I don't play Blitz.

287
00:20:49,761 --> 00:20:49,982
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay.

288
00:20:50,022 --> 00:20:52,483
[SPEAKER_01]: I play the stupid Butterfly mode and Diamond Mine mode.

289
00:20:52,523 --> 00:20:53,303
[SPEAKER_05]: What is Butterfly?

290
00:20:53,703 --> 00:20:54,524
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm so out of the loop.

291
00:20:54,764 --> 00:20:55,325
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

292
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:19,310
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, is that it for your gaming week?

293
00:21:19,851 --> 00:21:42,510
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes Alright, well before we get to Loki's gaming week We're going to cut in here because it's about that time We are going to go to the phones right now And talk to Mike Kennedy He is with Retro Which is a Kickstarter that's going on right now For a throwback video game magazine As in like a print magazine And let's see if we get him on the line Hi Mike, you there?

294
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:43,450
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm here.

295
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:44,010
[SPEAKER_05]: How's it going?

296
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:44,570
[SPEAKER_05]: Good.

297
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:45,791
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome to Orange Lounge Radio.

298
00:21:45,831 --> 00:21:46,311
[SPEAKER_05]: How are you?

299
00:21:46,671 --> 00:21:47,231
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm doing great.

300
00:21:47,251 --> 00:21:47,991
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for having me on.

301
00:21:48,251 --> 00:21:49,751
[SPEAKER_05]: No problem whatsoever.

302
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:52,132
[SPEAKER_05]: So tell us a little bit about your Kickstarter.

303
00:21:52,152 --> 00:21:54,933
[SPEAKER_05]: You're behind this Kickstarter for a new magazine, Retro, right?

304
00:21:55,633 --> 00:21:56,053
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.

305
00:21:56,073 --> 00:21:58,233
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something that has come about pretty quick.

306
00:21:58,713 --> 00:22:06,035
[SPEAKER_00]: I've actually had the idea of adding content to a gaming auction site that I've run called Game Gavel for about, I don't know, maybe two years now.

307
00:22:06,195 --> 00:22:06,375
[SPEAKER_10]: Mm-hmm.

308
00:22:06,975 --> 00:22:14,922
[SPEAKER_00]: and we originally were bringing on some writers and we were doing just online content, kind of an editorial side of the website.

309
00:22:15,382 --> 00:22:19,506
[SPEAKER_00]: And then one of my writers said, Mike, have you ever thought about doing a digital magazine?

310
00:22:19,546 --> 00:22:22,368
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought, well, hell no, I've never really thought about doing a digital magazine.

311
00:22:23,649 --> 00:22:30,175
[SPEAKER_00]: Only because I've never, I mean, personally, I don't have digital magazines on my iPad and I don't know how many people really do.

312
00:22:31,656 --> 00:22:34,999
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're hoping, obviously, that it's something that people are doing more and more of.

313
00:22:36,339 --> 00:22:41,661
[SPEAKER_00]: But then I got the idea after hooking up with another guy, Mark Kaminski, who's our layout and design guy.

314
00:22:42,162 --> 00:22:43,202
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, let's go for it.

315
00:22:43,242 --> 00:22:44,923
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do it both.

316
00:22:44,943 --> 00:22:46,423
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do print and digital.

317
00:22:47,163 --> 00:22:51,705
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was maybe two and a half weeks ago, maybe three weeks ago, TOPS.

318
00:22:52,706 --> 00:23:01,589
[SPEAKER_00]: And since he's come on board, he works for just this really large media company, and he does magazine layout and design for tons of other magazines.

319
00:23:02,309 --> 00:23:16,116
[SPEAKER_00]: and he basically wanted to contribute to the project and just basically came on board and has just really, I just have to say kicked ass because he designed that video force that we're using on the Kickstarter page.

320
00:23:17,377 --> 00:23:23,400
[SPEAKER_00]: He designed kind of a preview layout of the magazine and he's just kind of done this all really, really fast.

321
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:28,962
[SPEAKER_00]: So he was sort of the missing link in the idea of doing whether it was a digital or a print magazine.

322
00:23:28,982 --> 00:23:29,723
[SPEAKER_00]: So this...

323
00:23:30,283 --> 00:23:30,924
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

324
00:23:50,369 --> 00:24:00,743
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only writers from maybe the past five to ten years, but going back and really digging deep into the history of video game journalism and going out and just kind of recruiting.

325
00:24:01,203 --> 00:24:04,588
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now we've got over three decades of video game journalists.

326
00:24:04,628 --> 00:24:05,289
[SPEAKER_00]: So no matter...

327
00:24:05,689 --> 00:24:17,373
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when anybody kind of grew up gaming or what your decade of gaming was, whether it was the, you know, late 70s, early to mid 80s, the 90s or today, you're probably going to recognize some of the contributors that we're going to have on the magazine.

328
00:24:17,393 --> 00:24:21,314
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had to assemble this team really in about a week's time, you know.

329
00:24:22,154 --> 00:24:31,077
[SPEAKER_00]: I called Jeremy Parrish and I go, Jeremy, you know, gave me tons and tons of great information about, you know, compensation, you know, in this day and age and what you kind of need to pay.

330
00:24:31,097 --> 00:24:31,738
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

331
00:24:31,798 --> 00:24:31,918
[SPEAKER_00]: And...

332
00:24:33,318 --> 00:24:44,929
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've got quite a few connections in the industry already, just running Game Gavel for the last six years and kind of living in Southern California, kind of the hotbed of developer and publisher activity.

333
00:24:44,949 --> 00:24:50,254
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lot of friends that are developers and publishing executives and stuff like that.

334
00:24:51,794 --> 00:25:03,697
[SPEAKER_00]: It just sort of, the plans just sort of aligned very quickly on this thing, and I was able to assemble pretty much kind of a who's who of gaming journalists to bring them in on this, and lo and behold, everybody thought it was a great idea.

335
00:25:04,717 --> 00:25:11,359
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, a lot of them said that they've all had ideas for doing something like this, but just never done it yet.

336
00:25:11,579 --> 00:25:22,106
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's kind of one of those, it almost sounds like it's like, I don't know, like they bring in everything together, like the Voltron or something of these writers.

337
00:25:22,566 --> 00:25:31,552
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's why I expressed surprise a minute ago is that, wow, this thing's only three weeks old because, you know, you go over to the Kickstarter page and I'm scrolling and scrolling and scrolling and scrolling.

338
00:25:31,992 --> 00:25:39,456
[SPEAKER_05]: and it's, you know, this big list of people and I'm like, wow, you got your little Team America together, well, Team Worldwide, really, together in like three weeks.

339
00:25:39,516 --> 00:25:40,257
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty stunning.

340
00:25:40,337 --> 00:25:46,220
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't really make it through the bottom of the page because I stopped to look at Sean Baby's hair and I was just like, what is going on there?

341
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:47,921
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't understand this.

342
00:25:48,302 --> 00:25:48,762
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't either.

343
00:25:48,782 --> 00:25:50,044
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I met him for the first time.

344
00:25:50,064 --> 00:25:55,771
[SPEAKER_00]: We were at the Portland Retro Gaming Expo last weekend, and he was up there, and we've been talking on the phone a lot.

345
00:25:56,772 --> 00:26:04,182
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, he's basically, that's pretty much it, you know, and I think he'll, sometimes that little mohawk's green and fluorescent green, sometimes it's orange.

346
00:26:05,022 --> 00:26:10,266
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm very jealous of him that it's not falling out because when you dye your hair that much, that's what's supposed to be happening.

347
00:26:10,286 --> 00:26:18,032
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway, if you guys have a question for Mike with Retro Magazine Kickstarter, you can ask that live here in our chat room, live.vognetwork.com.

348
00:26:18,372 --> 00:26:22,035
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, I know you're dying to say something here because you've been studying print for a while.

349
00:26:22,195 --> 00:26:24,056
[SPEAKER_05]: This has to be tickling you, this whole idea, right?

350
00:26:24,196 --> 00:26:25,457
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you had me at print.

351
00:26:25,517 --> 00:26:27,859
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the smell of CMYK fumes in the morning.

352
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:29,280
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.

353
00:26:29,785 --> 00:26:31,586
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually am a print designer.

354
00:26:31,606 --> 00:26:32,487
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you?

355
00:26:33,127 --> 00:26:35,909
[SPEAKER_01]: And I actually have just recently gone into contract writing.

356
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:37,070
[SPEAKER_10]: Nice.

357
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:39,012
[SPEAKER_01]: As in writing by contract.

358
00:26:39,512 --> 00:26:39,872
[SPEAKER_01]: Really?

359
00:26:40,132 --> 00:26:40,813
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I have.

360
00:26:40,933 --> 00:26:44,836
[SPEAKER_01]: So I find the whole thing just very fascinating.

361
00:26:45,236 --> 00:26:51,240
[SPEAKER_01]: I was wondering though where you happen to get other bits of inspiration from because I know that in the UK there's Retro Gamer.

362
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:51,941
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

363
00:26:52,041 --> 00:26:52,541
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now.

364
00:26:52,561 --> 00:26:52,861
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.

365
00:26:54,122 --> 00:26:55,904
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, that's a great magazine.

366
00:26:56,044 --> 00:27:02,009
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if we can put together something half as good as that, I'd love it.

367
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:09,076
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing that's so great about their magazine is they pack so much into it, and they throw it all together.

368
00:27:10,036 --> 00:27:28,950
[SPEAKER_00]: and like every spread every like you know two page spread will have like 10 different stories going on but yet they make it work you know what I mean and every time you read that magazine you see something new it doesn't matter how many times you pick it up or you know how old the magazine is I mean you're reading through it and you're like god I don't remember reading this you know the other 20 times I've flipped through the pages you know

369
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:30,611
[SPEAKER_01]: Their design is so clever.

370
00:27:30,691 --> 00:27:37,535
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was thinking, I've thought for a while that we could use something like that geared toward a North American audience.

371
00:27:37,575 --> 00:27:40,736
[SPEAKER_01]: Because some of the machines they cover over there, we never got out over here.

372
00:27:41,417 --> 00:27:45,019
[SPEAKER_01]: But are you also planning on including some of the old import market?

373
00:27:45,179 --> 00:27:50,022
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I tell you what, since we've launched the Kickstarter campaign, we have had...

374
00:27:51,082 --> 00:27:56,163
[SPEAKER_00]: Some great writers from around the world contact us and want to be a part of this.

375
00:27:56,843 --> 00:27:57,663
[SPEAKER_00]: Also in the US.

376
00:27:57,763 --> 00:27:59,864
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's why this list keeps growing.

377
00:27:59,924 --> 00:28:07,205
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, when I first started out with this, I had like Jeremy, Sean, Kat.

378
00:28:07,945 --> 00:28:09,385
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we went after Bob Mackie.

379
00:28:09,505 --> 00:28:14,246
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, the doors opened to him, but he had some other things that might get in the way, he thought.

380
00:28:14,866 --> 00:28:15,426
[SPEAKER_00]: And a few others.

381
00:28:15,466 --> 00:28:17,627
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had like maybe 10 to 12 people.

382
00:28:17,987 --> 00:28:19,907
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think now we've grown to like over 20 people.

383
00:28:20,627 --> 00:28:22,508
[SPEAKER_00]: because people just want to be a part of this.

384
00:28:22,648 --> 00:28:28,152
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost like they're not doing it for the money, of course, because right now it's so segmented.

385
00:28:28,172 --> 00:28:28,832
[SPEAKER_00]: We have so many people.

386
00:28:28,852 --> 00:28:32,674
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like any one of them is going to be submitting so many things.

387
00:28:32,714 --> 00:28:35,396
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of these people are going to be submitting maybe one or two columns.

388
00:28:36,316 --> 00:28:44,680
[SPEAKER_00]: that are recurring, while we have others that might do a feature article, an interview if we want them to do that, or some assignment-type work.

389
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:53,604
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, to answer the question, we've had a couple of folks in Japan send me some of their work, and they're journalists and podcasters over there.

390
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:56,105
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had someone in the UK.

391
00:28:56,145 --> 00:28:57,306
[SPEAKER_00]: We had somebody in Germany.

392
00:28:57,946 --> 00:29:00,747
[SPEAKER_00]: And the deal is, I mean, I'm basically...

393
00:29:02,408 --> 00:29:12,192
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd love to have import information in here, whether it's current gen or retro and classic information, because those areas had huge influences, even on the gaming here in the United States.

394
00:29:13,133 --> 00:29:26,438
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's sort of like, I don't know what your first introduction was to Japanese gaming, but the TurboGrafx for me when I was little was sort of that strange, mystical console that played Japanese games.

395
00:29:27,018 --> 00:29:30,180
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I guess the Neo Geo kind of came in and

396
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:34,662
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess maybe right after that or pretty damn near about the same time, I guess.

397
00:29:34,702 --> 00:29:36,523
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, it's always just weird.

398
00:29:36,583 --> 00:29:41,706
[SPEAKER_00]: And seeing these games, you know, was just totally, you know, mind-blowing to see what they were doing over there.

399
00:29:41,746 --> 00:29:42,867
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's some great history there.

400
00:29:43,267 --> 00:29:45,168
[SPEAKER_00]: And we really want to cover all the bases in retro.

401
00:29:45,248 --> 00:29:46,489
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, all the bases.

402
00:29:46,849 --> 00:29:47,990
[SPEAKER_01]: So that personally makes me happy.

403
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:53,134
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess you could imagine my delight when I married someone who had a turbo duo and an EOGO.

404
00:29:53,514 --> 00:29:55,255
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.

405
00:29:55,696 --> 00:29:59,118
[SPEAKER_05]: I always like to ask this question of Kickstarter folks when they come on the show.

406
00:30:00,439 --> 00:30:02,201
[SPEAKER_05]: You have this Kickstarter behind the campaign.

407
00:30:02,561 --> 00:30:07,144
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's kind of obvious that the money is probably being raised because you actually have to print the magazine.

408
00:30:07,164 --> 00:30:08,105
[SPEAKER_05]: That doesn't come for free.

409
00:30:08,145 --> 00:30:11,928
[SPEAKER_05]: But what is it you're specifically raising the money to do in this process?

410
00:30:12,108 --> 00:30:13,849
[SPEAKER_00]: mainly actually paying the writers.

411
00:30:14,329 --> 00:30:15,590
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, these guys don't come cheap.

412
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:21,434
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, my original budget was about $6,000 per issue.

413
00:30:22,075 --> 00:30:24,616
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and if we got six issues, there's $36,000 right there, right?

414
00:30:24,736 --> 00:30:25,037
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

415
00:30:26,217 --> 00:30:27,919
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, we do have printing costs.

416
00:30:27,979 --> 00:30:33,262
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, Mark, being in the industry, you know, Mark commits to my layout and design guy, he's got some great contacts.

417
00:30:33,282 --> 00:30:36,104
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've really got our printing costs in check.

418
00:30:36,304 --> 00:30:38,005
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we've got them way low.

419
00:30:38,145 --> 00:30:41,007
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if we could even get up to, and this is sort of maybe a lofty goal right now,

420
00:30:43,229 --> 00:30:44,610
[SPEAKER_00]: A total of 10,000 print issues.

421
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:50,494
[SPEAKER_00]: It drops down to about 90 cents an issue or a print.

422
00:30:51,035 --> 00:30:56,739
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, it's going to be a minimum of 52 pages, a high-gloss page, and we're going to do a thick stock cover.

423
00:30:56,759 --> 00:30:58,961
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you guys remember Next Generation magazine?

424
00:30:59,241 --> 00:30:59,562
[SPEAKER_00]: I do.

425
00:30:59,942 --> 00:31:00,142
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

426
00:31:00,162 --> 00:31:05,810
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, one of the last greatest magazines, at least as far as I'm concerned, you know, and they always had that thick cover.

427
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:12,680
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've still got, you know, I think the first two years, even their premier issue up in my closet because I just can't throw them away.

428
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:13,601
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just too nice.

429
00:31:13,701 --> 00:31:14,482
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're a resource.

430
00:31:14,963 --> 00:31:15,163
[SPEAKER_00]: and so on.

431
00:31:34,394 --> 00:31:38,236
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, and, uh, just, just something that's going to kind of be a resource.

432
00:31:38,877 --> 00:31:47,542
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, Mark, you know, being the great guy is, you know, we're, we're, we put an update in there about, you know, using environmentally conscious, you know, materials and everything, soy inks and, and recyclable paper.

433
00:31:47,582 --> 00:31:49,042
[SPEAKER_00]: But the thing is going to look beautiful.

434
00:31:49,783 --> 00:31:49,863
[SPEAKER_00]: Um,

435
00:31:50,464 --> 00:31:53,508
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are all things that we're thinking about.

436
00:31:53,989 --> 00:32:01,039
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to Mark for coming on and being in the industry and knowing where to go and putting this whole thing together.

437
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:03,783
[SPEAKER_00]: The magazine is going to look as good as anything you've ever seen.

438
00:32:03,803 --> 00:32:05,506
[SPEAKER_00]: I can guarantee you that with him on board this thing.

439
00:32:05,686 --> 00:32:05,806
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

440
00:32:33,689 --> 00:32:34,470
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well, for sure.

441
00:32:34,530 --> 00:32:36,531
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, every magazine is going to cover everything.

442
00:32:36,571 --> 00:32:38,273
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be heavily weighted with retro, of course.

443
00:32:38,933 --> 00:32:46,940
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly any current generation games or gaming, you know, topics that have some sort of a historical background or relevance we want to talk about.

444
00:32:47,981 --> 00:32:49,082
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we're kind of going back and forth.

445
00:32:49,102 --> 00:32:52,464
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not to say we won't, you know, review AAA titles.

446
00:32:52,865 --> 00:32:58,209
[SPEAKER_00]: But, I mean, what's the point of reviewing, you know, Call of Duty 12 if every other magazine and every other website is already doing it?

447
00:32:58,229 --> 00:32:58,710
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?

448
00:32:58,730 --> 00:32:59,070
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

449
00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:01,252
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, like I said...

450
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:06,233
[SPEAKER_00]: You may or may not see those types of things reviewed.

451
00:33:06,293 --> 00:33:09,014
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, we're going to hopefully look for stuff that kind of flies under the radar.

452
00:33:09,034 --> 00:33:15,275
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly, the indie stuff is big right now, and there's tons of innovation there, even on the retro side and mobile.

453
00:33:16,155 --> 00:33:21,396
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can expect console, mobile, indie, PC gaming, arcade and pinball.

454
00:33:21,436 --> 00:33:24,337
[SPEAKER_00]: We got Kevin Steele in there from Game Room Magazine going to bring up that end of it.

455
00:33:26,007 --> 00:33:26,507
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

456
00:33:45,637 --> 00:33:46,578
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we don't really know.

457
00:33:46,638 --> 00:33:50,039
[SPEAKER_00]: We know it's going to be a minimum of 52 pages and only four pages of ads.

458
00:33:50,059 --> 00:33:55,502
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to keep it, you know, lots of in-depth features and stuff and minimal on the ad space.

459
00:33:56,702 --> 00:33:59,024
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, right now we've got so many people.

460
00:33:59,984 --> 00:34:02,345
[SPEAKER_00]: The trick for us is going to be, you know, how do we juggle everybody?

461
00:34:02,385 --> 00:34:03,546
[SPEAKER_00]: Is everybody in every issue?

462
00:34:04,386 --> 00:34:06,547
[SPEAKER_00]: Are some people staggered, you know, every other issue?

463
00:34:07,388 --> 00:34:08,888
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do we just simply add more pages?

464
00:34:08,928 --> 00:34:10,309
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, that's what we'd want to do.

465
00:34:11,189 --> 00:34:20,911
[SPEAKER_00]: and I think we get up, you know, if we can get up over, you know, to the 60s, you know, our goal is 50,000, which really is what we've budgeted as sort of a break-even point to produce six 52-page issues.

466
00:34:21,331 --> 00:34:34,754
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we can go, you know, if we can get up to 60,000, 70,000, we'd like to add, you know, another four pages, you know, four-page increments, of course, and get up to 60 pages and, you know, maybe get into the 80 to 90-page range, maybe before the year's over.

467
00:34:36,475 --> 00:34:39,677
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be no shortage of content, I'll tell you that.

468
00:34:41,238 --> 00:34:45,581
[SPEAKER_00]: These guys are already coming up with some great ideas, things they're going to be writing about.

469
00:34:45,961 --> 00:34:50,024
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just as excited as everybody else to be reading what all these people have to say.

470
00:34:50,044 --> 00:34:51,185
[SPEAKER_05]: You're just putting this all together.

471
00:34:51,245 --> 00:34:53,126
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't wait to read it yourself, I think.

472
00:34:54,127 --> 00:34:54,527
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't.

473
00:34:54,567 --> 00:34:55,548
[SPEAKER_00]: I really can't.

474
00:34:55,588 --> 00:34:58,069
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew up gaming in the 70s.

475
00:34:58,109 --> 00:35:02,672
[SPEAKER_00]: Electronic Games, the first magazine dedicated to the hobby back in the early 80s.

476
00:35:05,274 --> 00:35:11,858
[SPEAKER_00]: I also remember, I was really fond of, my first gaming system, and I'm using my quotey fingers, was really a Commodore 64, so I remember...

477
00:35:25,385 --> 00:35:33,991
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember the magazines that were like the really nice glossy pages in the beginning and the back was more like newspaper because it was all the type these into your computer to get these games type of thing.

478
00:35:34,011 --> 00:35:37,353
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I've got a Commodore 64 set up here in the home arcade.

479
00:35:37,373 --> 00:35:45,238
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, it's, you know, I collect, you know, that's part of the reason I started Game Gavel, the auction site back in 08, which is to give gamers a better place to buy and sell.

480
00:35:45,318 --> 00:35:47,840
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot cheaper than eBay, free listings, free seller stores.

481
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,301
[SPEAKER_00]: We got tons of great sellers on there.

482
00:35:50,421 --> 00:35:59,586
[SPEAKER_00]: And the plan, and we're not going to bombard people with game gavel in the magazine, but on the digital side, well, first off, everybody that buys the print subscription is going to get digital for free, okay?

483
00:35:59,606 --> 00:36:01,227
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to be able to kind of get both.

484
00:36:02,448 --> 00:36:06,069
[SPEAKER_00]: The digital magazines, we will have maybe just a shopping cart icon.

485
00:36:06,089 --> 00:36:08,891
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're reading about a game, you know, we'll put a shopping cart on there.

486
00:36:08,911 --> 00:36:14,774
[SPEAKER_00]: If you click the shopping cart, it'll pull up the listings in the auction site for all the other gamers that are selling that game.

487
00:36:14,794 --> 00:36:15,094
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

488
00:36:15,895 --> 00:36:18,197
[SPEAKER_00]: and bringing people into the marketplace to buy and sell.

489
00:36:18,397 --> 00:36:23,141
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of the plan, kind of integrating the commerce with the content, at least with the digital.

490
00:36:23,161 --> 00:36:26,545
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to say a little bit of synergy between your different projects, but that's smart.

491
00:36:26,705 --> 00:36:28,106
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there's nothing wrong with that.

492
00:36:28,546 --> 00:36:34,232
[SPEAKER_05]: If you guys want to consider donating to Retro, the throwback video game magazine, you can find that on Kickstarter.

493
00:36:34,472 --> 00:36:40,818
[SPEAKER_05]: It's at kickstarter.com slash project slash SoCalMike, but it's probably easier to just go to kickstarter.com and search for Retro.

494
00:36:41,238 --> 00:36:43,881
[SPEAKER_05]: Retro, some of the different various award tiers.

495
00:36:43,921 --> 00:36:47,986
[SPEAKER_05]: You can actually get for $7 the premiere issue of Retro.

496
00:36:48,086 --> 00:36:55,574
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to look at a six-issue one-year digital subscription, you can kick back $12 for that.

497
00:36:55,594 --> 00:36:57,636
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, you said the magic P word, pinball?

498
00:36:57,657 --> 00:36:57,757
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

499
00:37:02,882 --> 00:37:08,026
[SPEAKER_01]: So, that actually really, my husband and I collect pinball tables.

500
00:37:08,426 --> 00:37:08,747
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, right.

501
00:37:09,027 --> 00:37:10,468
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're down to three.

502
00:37:11,809 --> 00:37:13,510
[SPEAKER_01]: But we have a Twilight Zone, so that's what matters.

503
00:37:14,151 --> 00:37:15,291
[SPEAKER_00]: What else do you guys have?

504
00:37:15,351 --> 00:37:19,615
[SPEAKER_01]: We have World Cup Soccer 94, which was my favorite, and Jackbot.

505
00:37:20,315 --> 00:37:20,936
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, right, yeah.

506
00:37:20,956 --> 00:37:23,537
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually got rid of No Fear for Jackbot.

507
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,543
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually have hung out a few times with Steve Ritchie.

508
00:37:29,384 --> 00:37:30,145
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we know Steve.

509
00:37:30,305 --> 00:37:31,306
[SPEAKER_00]: He's such a great guy.

510
00:37:31,526 --> 00:37:32,247
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.

511
00:37:32,547 --> 00:37:33,328
[SPEAKER_01]: And he does the voices.

512
00:37:33,368 --> 00:37:36,031
[SPEAKER_01]: That's so amazing.

513
00:37:36,592 --> 00:37:41,998
[SPEAKER_01]: What I was wondering about the pinball is if you were going to be doing interviews with Stern and covering some of the newer...

514
00:37:42,819 --> 00:37:47,020
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, I know Stern real well.

515
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,381
[SPEAKER_00]: We know Jersey Jack real well.

516
00:37:49,501 --> 00:37:52,642
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they just came out with Wizard of Oz and they're working, I think, on their second table now.

517
00:37:53,942 --> 00:38:00,124
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I mean, anytime there's a new table out, we want to do, you know, an in-depth review of that thing and, you know, interview the designers behind it.

518
00:38:01,105 --> 00:38:09,090
[SPEAKER_00]: We've just, we've got great, you know, again, I've just got some great, great contacts going back, you know, through the years and everything.

519
00:38:09,371 --> 00:38:13,273
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do Retro Gaming Roundup podcast for about six years.

520
00:38:13,333 --> 00:38:19,678
[SPEAKER_00]: And every one of those shows, we do a one to two hour interview with somebody, you know, famous, some old gaming, you know, god.

521
00:38:20,258 --> 00:38:25,722
[SPEAKER_00]: We did Al Alcorn and Ted Dabney, all the Activision guys, Steve, I mean, some of the pinball folks.

522
00:38:25,782 --> 00:38:27,784
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it goes on and on and on.

523
00:38:28,024 --> 00:38:31,347
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkTetsuya in our chatroom says, out of all the names you got involved, who were you the most excited to get on board?

524
00:38:56,127 --> 00:38:59,710
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, boy, I would have to say, if I could answer to, well, I don't know.

525
00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:04,515
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd have to say Jeremy Parrish because, you know, Jeremy is, is such a consummate professional.

526
00:39:04,695 --> 00:39:06,377
[SPEAKER_00]: He's just, he's a great writer.

527
00:39:06,918 --> 00:39:08,620
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and people love Jeremy.

528
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,922
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's just something about him that everybody loves.

529
00:39:11,703 --> 00:39:12,884
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, uh,

530
00:39:13,124 --> 00:39:15,267
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate to single anybody out.

531
00:39:15,347 --> 00:39:27,301
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, Sean Baby, Chris Kohler, Jeff Green, Andy Eddy, for God's sakes, Cat Bailey, Ryan Scott, Leonard Herman, a big historian in the industry that writes just these great books.

532
00:39:27,682 --> 00:39:31,226
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm excited about having Lenny on board is he writes some of them.

533
00:39:31,586 --> 00:39:33,028
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you familiar with Lenny Herman?

534
00:39:35,043 --> 00:39:38,245
[SPEAKER_05]: The name doesn't ring a bell, but it's probably one of those things when you tell me what he did, I'll be like, yes.

535
00:39:55,173 --> 00:40:03,641
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, if you can write, you know, four or five, six pages on a particular topic, you know, I think kids will read it and really learn something about the industry.

536
00:40:03,661 --> 00:40:04,661
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we really want to do.

537
00:40:04,701 --> 00:40:09,826
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to sort of preserve the past and kind of look back and understand, you know, why the industry is what it is.

538
00:40:09,866 --> 00:40:14,330
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, God, when it started, everybody thought it was going to be a fad, I remember, back in the 70s and the 80s, you know.

539
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:16,631
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody knew it was going to be around for another 30 years.

540
00:40:17,432 --> 00:40:28,862
[SPEAKER_05]: I really love reading the stories from the time when people were developing for the Atari 2600 when it just sounded like it was so much pressure and it was like one or two people and it's such a different type of culture than what we see now.

541
00:40:28,902 --> 00:40:31,264
[SPEAKER_05]: We had two days to make Pac-Man.

542
00:40:31,404 --> 00:40:34,446
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm always fascinated by that and really how it's grown into these.

543
00:40:34,526 --> 00:40:39,631
[SPEAKER_05]: Now you look at a game like Grand Theft Auto V and it's like shooting five movies all at the same time.

544
00:40:40,451 --> 00:40:42,514
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's really insane.

545
00:40:42,594 --> 00:40:43,295
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really insane.

546
00:40:43,375 --> 00:40:44,557
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I'd have to say Jeremy.

547
00:40:44,577 --> 00:40:47,941
[SPEAKER_00]: I was really glad to get him on more, but not to just pick anybody.

548
00:40:48,162 --> 00:40:51,646
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just loving everybody that we've assembled into this thing so far.

549
00:40:52,087 --> 00:40:55,211
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of them have asked to get involved with it after the fact.

550
00:40:55,651 --> 00:40:55,852
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.

551
00:40:56,272 --> 00:41:02,254
[SPEAKER_00]: which is great, which just sort of, I think, just led some credibility to the idea of everybody wants to be a part of this thing.

552
00:41:02,534 --> 00:41:11,837
[SPEAKER_00]: And getting all of this wisdom and history packed into the pages of a single magazine has never been done before.

553
00:41:12,078 --> 00:41:15,779
[SPEAKER_00]: Even on a website, there's not been a writing team like this assembled.

554
00:41:16,379 --> 00:41:18,040
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just a special thing.

555
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:21,221
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we've got a long way to go.

556
00:41:21,281 --> 00:41:21,861
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we're

557
00:41:22,361 --> 00:41:24,683
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, around 35% of goal right now.

558
00:41:25,903 --> 00:41:28,345
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, we've got 20 days to go.

559
00:41:28,365 --> 00:41:30,827
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds like a long time, but the days kind of keep ticking away.

560
00:41:30,847 --> 00:41:33,608
[SPEAKER_00]: And I keep thinking to myself, you know, the trend has kind of been down.

561
00:41:33,628 --> 00:41:34,989
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've talked to people who run Kickstarters.

562
00:41:35,009 --> 00:41:37,031
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you guys know anybody or run any yourself.

563
00:41:37,051 --> 00:41:41,013
[SPEAKER_00]: But it sounds like there's a little bit of a kind of a smile where it kind of dips and goes down.

564
00:41:41,033 --> 00:41:45,176
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, people just wait because, you know, I wait a lot of times on Kickstarters.

565
00:41:45,196 --> 00:41:47,397
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll wait till the last few days or the last week, you know.

566
00:41:47,418 --> 00:41:50,980
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, there's a big kind of surge of people kind of that last week.

567
00:41:51,660 --> 00:42:17,592
[SPEAKER_05]: and so we kind of hope it goes that way I think the internet is kind of a funky place too where you kind of have to just catch that wave at the right moment where it hits and it goes viral and then it's spreading everywhere and then that's where your Kickstarter is really going to take off so I hope I'm not going to profess to be a very large organization here at Orange Launch Radio or the Voice of Geeks Network but I hope we can do what we can here by having you on tonight to bring awareness to it and maybe cause a little bit of an uptick with that

568
00:42:18,352 --> 00:42:22,873
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, if you guys want to look at retro, you can check that out at kickstarter.com.

569
00:42:22,914 --> 00:42:25,514
[SPEAKER_03]: And I am also happy to spread the word around the pinball circles.

570
00:42:26,134 --> 00:42:27,095
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, please do.

571
00:42:27,115 --> 00:42:31,056
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we want to definitely have some pinball content in every issue.

572
00:42:32,356 --> 00:42:34,217
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's plenty of things to talk about.

573
00:42:34,915 --> 00:42:35,916
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the special edition Tron.

574
00:42:58,999 --> 00:43:06,336
[SPEAKER_05]: Before I let Mike go, Mike, we always ask our guests this when they come on the show, and it may have nothing to do with the project that you're talking about, but we are a video game show.

575
00:43:06,376 --> 00:43:08,781
[SPEAKER_05]: We want to know what kind of games are you playing this week?

576
00:43:10,581 --> 00:43:11,121
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my gosh.

577
00:43:11,141 --> 00:43:16,764
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I just picked up a Missile Command cocktail table here on the Craigslist here in L.A.

578
00:43:17,644 --> 00:43:18,445
[SPEAKER_00]: for a whopping $140.

579
00:43:18,665 --> 00:43:18,725
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.

580
00:43:18,845 --> 00:43:20,145
[SPEAKER_00]: Really super cheap.

581
00:43:20,466 --> 00:43:21,886
[SPEAKER_05]: For a cocktail table, that's great.

582
00:43:22,326 --> 00:43:22,907
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my gosh.

583
00:43:22,927 --> 00:43:27,209
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, everybody, I got friends all over the country, and you guys are in L.A., right, or Southern California?

584
00:43:27,289 --> 00:43:29,590
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in Sacramento, so we're about six hours north of you, yeah.

585
00:43:30,630 --> 00:43:31,931
[SPEAKER_00]: I drove up there.

586
00:43:31,971 --> 00:43:35,513
[SPEAKER_00]: I drove to Portland and spent a night on the way up in SAC.

587
00:43:36,393 --> 00:43:40,896
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what it is up north, but down here it's just sort of like a feeding frenzy.

588
00:43:41,937 --> 00:43:45,879
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends are going nuts because I find such great deals like on Craigslist.

589
00:43:45,899 --> 00:43:46,860
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, Missile Command, $140?

590
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:49,241
[SPEAKER_00]: That would have been $500 in Virginia.

591
00:43:50,642 --> 00:43:55,084
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I just picked that up and I've been playing some... What was I playing today?

592
00:43:55,104 --> 00:43:58,406
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Gradius 5 on the PS2.

593
00:43:58,526 --> 00:43:59,127
[SPEAKER_00]: Great game.

594
00:43:59,927 --> 00:44:04,952
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a little man cave down here, kind of home office, where I've got four arcade games.

595
00:44:04,992 --> 00:44:06,814
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a Touchmaster hooked up.

596
00:44:06,834 --> 00:44:08,996
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got an Apple IIc, and my Commodore's hooked up.

597
00:44:09,056 --> 00:44:12,539
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got about 90 Commodore cartridges, and I play that all the time.

598
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:15,823
[SPEAKER_05]: So you don't just talk the talk with this retro stuff.

599
00:44:15,863 --> 00:44:17,184
[SPEAKER_05]: You walk the walk as well.

600
00:44:17,745 --> 00:44:19,426
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, man.

601
00:44:19,486 --> 00:44:19,867
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in deep.

602
00:44:19,887 --> 00:44:21,688
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank God my wife loves to play games as well.

603
00:44:22,369 --> 00:44:24,270
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how my husband and I got together.

604
00:44:24,630 --> 00:44:26,471
[SPEAKER_05]: Last thing here, DarkSakura, you had one more thing?

605
00:44:27,992 --> 00:44:33,275
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually was just thinking of... Imagine if our two vaults combined.

606
00:44:33,776 --> 00:44:35,297
[SPEAKER_01]: It would totally explode the world.

607
00:44:35,697 --> 00:44:38,318
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura and her hubby have a huge gaming vault as well.

608
00:44:41,260 --> 00:44:42,321
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to go play all this stuff now.

609
00:44:42,361 --> 00:44:45,823
[SPEAKER_01]: But you were actually asking a little bit about what the market is up here.

610
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:48,604
[SPEAKER_01]: For a lot of the retro games, they're actually quite expensive.

611
00:44:49,265 --> 00:44:49,365
[SPEAKER_01]: And...

612
00:44:49,605 --> 00:44:49,985
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura.com

613
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:02,660
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, yeah.

614
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:03,681
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's one of the greats.

615
00:45:04,041 --> 00:45:04,601
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

616
00:45:04,641 --> 00:45:06,081
[SPEAKER_01]: And we could get more if we wanted it.

617
00:45:06,321 --> 00:45:07,801
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I've got to wrap up and let Mike go.

618
00:45:07,861 --> 00:45:09,422
[SPEAKER_05]: Mike, thanks so much for your time here tonight.

619
00:45:09,442 --> 00:45:10,062
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you guys so much.

620
00:45:10,102 --> 00:45:13,082
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate the opportunity to tell your listeners about this.

621
00:45:13,242 --> 00:45:13,783
[SPEAKER_05]: No worries.

622
00:45:13,883 --> 00:45:14,963
[SPEAKER_05]: And best of luck with the project.

623
00:45:14,983 --> 00:45:20,224
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, one thing I don't think I really got out there during the interview is that we love that you're taking an indie approach to it.

624
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:23,144
[SPEAKER_05]: We've always been fiercely independent here at Orange Lawn Trader.

625
00:45:23,164 --> 00:45:24,845
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we've been doing what we do here since 2002.

626
00:45:24,945 --> 00:45:26,885
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, amazing.

627
00:45:27,605 --> 00:45:28,746
[SPEAKER_05]: For, you know, 11 plus years.

628
00:45:28,766 --> 00:45:30,506
[SPEAKER_05]: Before a podcast even was a podcast.

629
00:45:31,687 --> 00:45:35,489
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, actually, yeah, we were a live 365 show for a couple years before that.

630
00:45:35,509 --> 00:45:36,970
[SPEAKER_01]: We tell all the kids to get off our lawn.

631
00:45:37,110 --> 00:45:41,512
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, I mean, we love that you guys are keeping it independent with this.

632
00:45:41,592 --> 00:45:50,117
[SPEAKER_05]: Even if you are bringing in people who are kind of paid behind the big budget stuff, you're kind of at least getting them outside of that element for this indie production.

633
00:45:50,157 --> 00:45:51,198
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's fantastic.

634
00:45:51,298 --> 00:45:51,558
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great.

635
00:45:51,738 --> 00:45:53,279
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what they're going to be writing about.

636
00:46:09,470 --> 00:46:12,933
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll obviously kind of nail some of that down as we move forward to building the first issue.

637
00:46:12,973 --> 00:46:23,222
[SPEAKER_00]: But I really think that they're going to talk about things and write maybe just a little bit differently in this environment than they would normally write working for Future US or IGN or one of these big companies.

638
00:46:23,702 --> 00:46:29,948
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just really excited to kind of give them the freedom to kind of write what they want to write about, how they want to write.

639
00:46:30,468 --> 00:46:34,452
[SPEAKER_05]: A new side of some of your favorite video game authors.

640
00:46:35,873 --> 00:46:36,774
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, one last thing, too.

641
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:40,157
[SPEAKER_00]: Speaking of Live365, I also do RetroArcadeRadio.com.

642
00:46:40,197 --> 00:46:46,402
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just 24 hours a day, live streaming retro gaming-related music and old vintage commercials.

643
00:46:46,903 --> 00:46:48,424
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you guys are interested in that.

644
00:46:48,464 --> 00:46:49,105
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been going on.

645
00:46:49,485 --> 00:46:51,567
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been running that for about five or six years as well.

646
00:46:51,947 --> 00:46:56,271
[SPEAKER_00]: So RetroArcadeRadio.com, but it's a Live365 station as well.

647
00:46:57,873 --> 00:47:01,516
[SPEAKER_05]: They served a great purpose for us for many years until we decided to branch out.

648
00:47:01,857 --> 00:47:03,138
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, that's awesome.

649
00:47:03,358 --> 00:47:09,545
[SPEAKER_05]: That sounds like a great thing to do when you're playing your Commodore 64 with 90 cartridges and all this other crazy stuff you have.

650
00:47:09,625 --> 00:47:10,686
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's awesome.

651
00:47:10,706 --> 00:47:12,308
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, best of luck with your various projects.

652
00:47:12,849 --> 00:47:14,911
[SPEAKER_05]: That's retroarcadegameradio.com?

653
00:47:15,450 --> 00:47:16,471
[SPEAKER_05]: Retro Arcade Radio.

654
00:47:16,631 --> 00:47:17,892
[SPEAKER_05]: RetroArcadeRadio.com.

655
00:47:17,913 --> 00:47:18,133
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

656
00:47:18,333 --> 00:47:26,581
[SPEAKER_05]: So you got RetroArcadeRadio.com, GameGavel.com, and soon Retro Game Magazine or whatever domain you get for this.com as well.

657
00:47:26,601 --> 00:47:27,481
[SPEAKER_05]: You're a busy guy, Mike.

658
00:47:27,622 --> 00:47:28,823
[SPEAKER_05]: Best of luck with all your projects.

659
00:47:29,163 --> 00:47:29,724
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much.

660
00:47:29,764 --> 00:47:31,826
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for taking the time out to be with us here at OLR tonight.

661
00:47:31,886 --> 00:47:32,646
[SPEAKER_05]: Have a great night.

662
00:47:33,107 --> 00:47:33,447
[SPEAKER_05]: Bye, guys.

663
00:47:33,467 --> 00:47:34,028
[SPEAKER_05]: Bye-bye.

664
00:47:35,325 --> 00:47:36,466
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow, that was awesome.

665
00:47:36,847 --> 00:47:37,948
[SPEAKER_01]: He should be our new best friend.

666
00:47:40,551 --> 00:47:42,073
[SPEAKER_05]: You want to be his best friend.

667
00:47:42,193 --> 00:47:42,694
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I liked him.

668
00:47:42,734 --> 00:47:43,515
[SPEAKER_05]: He seemed well enough.

669
00:47:43,575 --> 00:47:46,918
[SPEAKER_05]: But you guys definitely have the retro pinball, that same-sames there.

670
00:47:46,938 --> 00:47:48,260
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, at the moment he said pinball.

671
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:49,762
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, bing!

672
00:47:49,882 --> 00:47:55,528
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you don't get any of that in any of the current publications, really, unless it's specifically pinball.

673
00:47:56,389 --> 00:48:15,796
[SPEAKER_01]: and I mean especially now with you know for example that Wizard of Oz table has such a heavy video element with it that or all the pinball 2000 that had the screens you're dealing with a pinball and video game you know a digital game combined that isn't baby pac-man

674
00:48:16,797 --> 00:48:17,818
[SPEAKER_05]: But I still love Baby Pac-Man.

675
00:48:17,838 --> 00:48:18,759
[SPEAKER_01]: I still love Baby Pac-Man.

676
00:48:18,839 --> 00:48:19,880
[SPEAKER_01]: I love me some Baby Pac-Man.

677
00:48:19,940 --> 00:48:21,101
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, best of luck to those guys.

678
00:48:21,201 --> 00:48:23,283
[SPEAKER_05]: One more time, you can search for that on Kickstarter.com.

679
00:48:23,323 --> 00:48:26,426
[SPEAKER_05]: It is retro and I'll probably contribute a little bit for that effort.

680
00:48:26,706 --> 00:48:33,712
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's a fine idea they've got over there and I would not mind having some more magazines to put on the shelves here.

681
00:48:33,732 --> 00:48:35,574
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe this will take my Kickstarter virginity.

682
00:48:36,275 --> 00:48:36,915
[SPEAKER_05]: Ooh, okay.

683
00:48:37,756 --> 00:48:39,076
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right, you've never donated to a Kickstarter.

684
00:48:39,096 --> 00:48:42,077
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, because my Amazon payments weren't working every time I freaking tried.

685
00:48:42,537 --> 00:48:43,337
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

686
00:48:43,537 --> 00:49:05,645
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, before we move on to the rest of our gaming weeks, I did want to point out over in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com, there was a lot of other chatter that weren't just questions for Mike, but there was talk going on there about some other gaming magazine memories, and we're going to get into that with our Fugo question of the week later, but I did want to point out for DarkSakra, Codeman was offering to go get high with you on some CMYK fumes.

687
00:49:06,047 --> 00:49:08,868
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, I think I actually started that.

688
00:49:09,309 --> 00:49:09,909
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

689
00:49:11,269 --> 00:49:21,514
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, if you are a print design person, there is no smell as wonderful as stepping into a print shop and smelling the toxic fumes.

690
00:49:21,994 --> 00:49:27,237
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to tell you that traditional ink smells a lot different than the soy ink, and I don't know what I like better.

691
00:49:28,578 --> 00:49:29,038
[SPEAKER_01]: Just saying.

692
00:49:29,358 --> 00:49:32,539
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you smelled a print shop on weed?

693
00:49:34,119 --> 00:49:37,983
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

694
00:49:51,678 --> 00:50:15,141
[SPEAKER_02]: to my PS3 character so I managed to get up to level 10 on my 360 character and then I decided well one night I was trying to play with Bobby but he kept getting stuck in like full games and I couldn't join his game so I ended up just going back to single player and trying to finish my 100% stuff so that's what I've been doing since earlier this week and I'm now 80

695
00:50:18,620 --> 00:50:19,701
[SPEAKER_02]: 2% complete, I think.

696
00:50:20,021 --> 00:50:24,604
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pretty much almost done with the Epsilon program missions.

697
00:50:26,785 --> 00:50:27,626
[SPEAKER_02]: What else did I do?

698
00:50:27,786 --> 00:50:30,628
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I finished all the triathlons.

699
00:50:32,109 --> 00:50:33,249
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously, Rockstars?

700
00:50:33,430 --> 00:50:33,970
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously?

701
00:50:34,010 --> 00:50:37,072
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a 30-minute fucking long triathlon?

702
00:50:37,112 --> 00:50:43,036
[SPEAKER_02]: 30 minutes in real time of Mashing A. Mashing A for 30 fucking minutes.

703
00:50:43,056 --> 00:50:44,777
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds about as awesome as Desert Bus.

704
00:50:45,609 --> 00:50:52,852
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that is so fucking... Oh, it's almost as fun as the part in Epsilon Missions where you have to run for five miles.

705
00:50:53,492 --> 00:50:56,573
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was sitting there running in circles for about 20 minutes.

706
00:50:57,454 --> 00:50:58,074
[SPEAKER_02]: That was fun.

707
00:50:59,014 --> 00:51:01,515
[SPEAKER_02]: Also mashing A for like a while.

708
00:51:02,696 --> 00:51:03,256
[SPEAKER_02]: And then what else?

709
00:51:03,776 --> 00:51:10,579
[SPEAKER_02]: So all the races and... I think I'm pretty much... I'm buying property and...

710
00:51:11,639 --> 00:51:18,165
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, pretty much I just have to do a lot of the collectibles and stunt jumps and the planes under the bridges and stuff.

711
00:51:18,585 --> 00:51:21,948
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have to finish that, and I think that'll be about it.

712
00:51:22,809 --> 00:51:24,810
[SPEAKER_02]: Not much left to go, but I'm going to still work on that.

713
00:51:25,090 --> 00:51:30,055
[SPEAKER_02]: But later this week, though, we are going to be doing two VOG gaming nights for Grand Theft Auto Online.

714
00:51:30,655 --> 00:51:33,678
[SPEAKER_02]: One day on PlayStation 3, one day on Xbox 360.

715
00:51:33,718 --> 00:51:33,758
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

716
00:51:35,299 --> 00:51:52,226
[SPEAKER_02]: stay tuned in the forums, I'm thinking right now that it's going to be Friday, Saturday I just have to make sure it doesn't conflict with any shows that's about it as long as it's not Saturday night when USL is on, you should be good if you do it a little earlier in the night Saturday should be fine

717
00:51:52,714 --> 00:51:53,315
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

718
00:52:13,317 --> 00:52:14,538
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm going to get caught up this week.

719
00:52:14,918 --> 00:52:19,619
[SPEAKER_05]: I did play a little bit of Final Fantasy XIV, not as much as you'd think based on what I said last week.

720
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:25,201
[SPEAKER_05]: I was fortunate enough to get into Hearthstone Beta, which is Blizzard's free-to-play trading card game.

721
00:52:26,002 --> 00:52:28,162
[SPEAKER_05]: I talked a little bit about this at length on Horde House.

722
00:52:28,342 --> 00:52:29,663
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll kind of repeat some of that here.

723
00:52:30,523 --> 00:52:45,889
[SPEAKER_05]: I did enjoy the game well enough especially for something that's free to play I found the gameplay to be a little bit basic but some card game aficionados who know this stuff a little more than I do seem to really enjoy it and kind of find the depth in it that I'm currently I guess not seeing or whatever

724
00:52:46,489 --> 00:52:53,134
[SPEAKER_05]: I was really surprised that you draw so few cards and it's really like the mana's all just kind of built in.

725
00:52:53,154 --> 00:52:55,155
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't have cards on your own for that or whatever.

726
00:52:55,996 --> 00:52:59,619
[SPEAKER_05]: But I guess the easy to play thing is really to try to draw in as many people as possible.

727
00:53:00,199 --> 00:53:05,423
[SPEAKER_05]: And kind of my final verdict on Hearthstone from what I've played on it so far is that I think it's going to be a great tablet game.

728
00:53:05,743 --> 00:53:06,844
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

729
00:53:24,494 --> 00:53:25,215
[SPEAKER_05]: Audio Surf 2 Audio Surf 1

730
00:53:46,870 --> 00:53:48,131
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

731
00:54:06,826 --> 00:54:07,166
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember that?

732
00:54:07,206 --> 00:54:11,628
[SPEAKER_05]: Where they come down the conveyor belt, the colored pieces will come down the conveyor belt and you try to match three, match five.

733
00:54:11,928 --> 00:54:14,789
[SPEAKER_05]: You kind of tried to do that really quick in AudioSurf.

734
00:54:15,249 --> 00:54:33,235
[SPEAKER_05]: But AudioSurf had a mode that I thought was way better called the mono mode where it was just pick up, you know, the pieces are black or white and it's just about navigating and being able to move through the field as fast as possible so you pick up only the pieces that are colorful and not the pieces that are, you know, the wrong color.

735
00:54:34,276 --> 00:54:35,297
[SPEAKER_05]: I like that mode the best.

736
00:54:50,271 --> 00:55:07,635
[SPEAKER_05]: because what you can do is that like let's say you know you're about to go down a big hill because when the tempo of the song picks up you start to go down a hill well what you do is you swing your character all the way to a side the side of the tunnel and click the mouse button and they'll like fly up in the air and then you're flying down the hill and you do tricks in the air

737
00:55:08,555 --> 00:55:31,554
[SPEAKER_05]: and then you kind of land like it's like like you're in like a jet ski type thing and you do these tricks I thought that was a really cool little innovation that's like I the way that plays and feels because you know that's when the crescendos of the music happens so to kind of do like this all like right when the crescendo of a big dance song hits like boom I'm gonna go flying in the air and do all these tricks like it's it's really rewarding in that sort of way so um

738
00:55:32,475 --> 00:55:35,378
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm liking what I'm seeing of AudioSurf 2 so far.

739
00:55:35,698 --> 00:55:37,980
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess one of the other big things they're going to do with it is mods.

740
00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:40,863
[SPEAKER_05]: They want to have more and more mods and user-created stuff.

741
00:55:40,923 --> 00:55:45,667
[SPEAKER_05]: I imagine this is going to be a part of that Steam... What do they call it?

742
00:55:45,687 --> 00:55:52,113
[SPEAKER_05]: The Steam community marketplace or something like that where people can make their own stuff like they have with Skyrim and Civilization and stuff.

743
00:55:52,493 --> 00:55:55,536
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't imagine this game isn't going to incorporate that big time, so...

744
00:55:56,056 --> 00:55:57,878
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

745
00:56:15,211 --> 00:56:19,975
[SPEAKER_05]: I was on another show, the Let's Wow podcast last week, episode 31.

746
00:56:20,875 --> 00:56:21,936
[SPEAKER_05]: That is now on the feed.

747
00:56:21,976 --> 00:56:28,321
[SPEAKER_05]: But when I was talking about that, I forgot to plug Gemet's stream that he's doing this Tuesday on into Wednesday.

748
00:56:28,341 --> 00:56:32,183
[SPEAKER_05]: He's going to be doing a 24-hour live stream for charity.

749
00:56:32,223 --> 00:56:34,325
[SPEAKER_05]: He's raising money for Breast Cancer Awareness Month.

750
00:56:34,685 --> 00:56:35,426
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

751
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:52,601
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

752
00:57:16,343 --> 00:57:17,864
[SPEAKER_05]: Twitter.com slash OLR.

753
00:57:17,944 --> 00:57:21,828
[SPEAKER_05]: We're also on Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

754
00:57:23,229 --> 00:57:24,830
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that's it.

755
00:57:25,451 --> 00:57:26,651
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all I've got to plug right now.

756
00:57:26,712 --> 00:57:28,153
[SPEAKER_05]: So I guess we should get into some news.

757
00:57:28,313 --> 00:57:28,573
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki.

758
00:57:29,354 --> 00:57:29,674
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

759
00:57:30,234 --> 00:57:35,519
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's talk a little bit about new devices coming out.

760
00:57:36,239 --> 00:57:53,353
[SPEAKER_02]: and you may remember we talked briefly about the Mojo which I think is pretty cool the Mad Catz micro console that's going to have Android games and stuff on it what's kind of unique about it is that it can actually play normal Android games it's not a separate marketplace you can actually map the controls and stuff

761
00:57:54,594 --> 00:57:58,699
[SPEAKER_02]: The only problem with it, though, is it's $250.

762
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:00,801
[SPEAKER_02]: But, yeah, so they announced $250.

763
00:58:01,201 --> 00:58:02,563
[SPEAKER_02]: It's up for pre-order.

764
00:58:02,583 --> 00:58:05,146
[SPEAKER_02]: Ships in December, tentatively.

765
00:58:06,487 --> 00:58:08,309
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the specs on it.

766
00:58:09,591 --> 00:58:14,176
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to have 16 gigabytes of storage with microSD support.

767
00:58:15,036 --> 00:58:24,818
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, they have a 1.8GHz Tegra 4 processor, so it's definitely more powerful than, say, an Ouya.

768
00:58:25,618 --> 00:58:38,621
[SPEAKER_02]: And it comes with a special controller that's Bluetooth-enabled, which allows you to also use it on Android or as a PC controller, or even use mouse input and stuff.

769
00:58:39,741 --> 00:58:41,863
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so that looks pretty cool.

770
00:58:41,983 --> 00:58:50,548
[SPEAKER_02]: And then one of the other cool things that you can do with this, and I guess it kind of helps warrant the $250 price point, is that you can actually stream PC games with it.

771
00:58:51,168 --> 00:58:53,690
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's going to be coming, I think, after it launches.

772
00:58:54,570 --> 00:58:58,753
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and it's going to like... Wait a minute, Loki, isn't that supposed to be the Steam Machines thing?

773
00:58:59,894 --> 00:59:01,955
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, technically, yeah, I guess it could be.

774
00:59:02,475 --> 00:59:03,256
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um...

775
00:59:04,964 --> 00:59:06,486
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's kind of cool.

776
00:59:06,506 --> 00:59:08,188
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see, here's some more specs on the Mojo.

777
00:59:08,748 --> 00:59:15,876
[SPEAKER_02]: Two gigs of RAM and one USB 2.0 and one USB 3.0 port.

778
00:59:16,256 --> 00:59:17,758
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's pretty cool that it supports that.

779
00:59:17,878 --> 00:59:20,381
[SPEAKER_02]: Bluetooth 4.0 and it's running Android 4.22.

780
00:59:25,134 --> 00:59:27,615
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even have a headphone socket on there, so that's kind of cool.

781
00:59:27,635 --> 00:59:29,655
[SPEAKER_02]: You can listen to your audio through that.

782
00:59:30,915 --> 00:59:32,595
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

783
00:59:32,615 --> 00:59:37,156
[SPEAKER_02]: I think for $250 and it can stream games to your TV, that's kind of cool.

784
00:59:37,616 --> 00:59:43,238
[SPEAKER_02]: If it was just strictly an Android box, that probably wouldn't be worth it for $250.

785
00:59:43,278 --> 00:59:46,558
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I don't know.

786
00:59:46,998 --> 00:59:49,999
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think would make it worth the cost?

787
00:59:50,475 --> 00:59:55,359
[SPEAKER_02]: For $250, it's going to do a lot more than just play Android games, I think.

788
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:57,641
[SPEAKER_02]: The controller looks nice, at least.

789
00:59:58,262 --> 01:00:09,131
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess a lot of people have their phones and stuff, and it would cost a lot less to probably just get an HDMI out on your phone or get some other type of streaming thing.

790
01:00:09,912 --> 01:00:17,158
[SPEAKER_02]: Since it does support Android, I suppose you could also use this as a box to watch Netflix or Hulu or anything like that on.

791
01:00:17,778 --> 01:00:42,286
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yay, just my living room needs another Netflix device Because I don't have any of those Some people don't have a lot of stuff Or some people might want a second one Or a third or fourth or whatever And plus it looks kind of nice I mean it's shiny, it's got blue light on the front I don't normally purchase my consoles based on lights But it definitely looks better More lights Passed out 57 LEDs

792
01:00:43,885 --> 01:00:44,125
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

793
01:00:44,145 --> 01:00:45,246
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the price point is a little expensive.

794
01:00:45,286 --> 01:00:47,807
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe if it comes down in price later on, it might be worth it for me.

795
01:00:48,127 --> 01:00:51,068
[SPEAKER_02]: But I just don't need any more consoles right now.

796
01:00:52,109 --> 01:00:54,050
[SPEAKER_02]: But the controller looks nice.

797
01:00:55,710 --> 01:00:59,212
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if I could use it on 360 or PS3, I might be down with that.

798
01:01:00,512 --> 01:01:04,453
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, well, going to some stories about the Xbox One happening out there.

799
01:01:04,914 --> 01:01:12,436
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a lot of talk this week about, you know, there's been a lot of talk about the Kinect and privacy and all that.

800
01:01:12,476 --> 01:01:16,418
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, ever since they announced the whole always-on thing, there was the concerns about privacy.

801
01:01:16,718 --> 01:01:18,379
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I don't think it's even necessarily that.

802
01:01:18,399 --> 01:01:24,301
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more ever since they announced all that stuff leaking out and, oh, Microsoft's in bed with the NSA type thing.

803
01:01:24,341 --> 01:01:24,981
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yeah, yeah.

804
01:01:25,081 --> 01:01:33,625
[SPEAKER_05]: But, I mean, this isn't even really about that, but it's been on people's minds because of that ever since they announced the system, and this was kind of an interesting development on that this week.

805
01:01:34,305 --> 01:01:44,489
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to totally pronounce this name, so I apologize, but it's Yusuf Mehdi, who is the Corporate Vice President of Marketing and Strategy for Microsoft, was talking to the National Advertisers Masters of Marketing Conference.

806
01:01:44,509 --> 01:01:45,750
[SPEAKER_05]: This was happening in Phoenix last

807
01:01:46,130 --> 01:01:46,830
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching.

808
01:01:46,890 --> 01:01:47,451
[SPEAKER_05]: See you next time.

809
01:02:08,938 --> 01:02:13,799
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's making games out of advertising, like, you know, interactive flash type things.

810
01:02:14,519 --> 01:02:22,181
[SPEAKER_05]: The fact that, like, take a social app like Foursquare is gamifying social media by, you know, you check in, you get points, there's the mayorship, there's all that.

811
01:02:22,661 --> 01:02:25,061
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all gamification because games are fun.

812
01:02:25,601 --> 01:02:27,242
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at vognetwork.com.

813
01:02:27,742 --> 01:02:32,163
[SPEAKER_05]: Gamified a radio network of independent podcasts and kind of made a game out of that.

814
01:02:32,523 --> 01:02:33,063
[SPEAKER_05]: That's gamification.

815
01:02:33,103 --> 01:02:36,987
[SPEAKER_03]: or the catchpa ones where you have to park the car to get your catchpa.

816
01:02:37,087 --> 01:02:39,690
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, which we actually use on vognetwork.com which is a fun one.

817
01:02:40,430 --> 01:02:43,814
[SPEAKER_01]: Or in reverse, the people who use their advertising as a catchpa.

818
01:02:43,934 --> 01:02:48,939
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, where you have to type in the name of the product or what product is blah blah blah.

819
01:02:48,959 --> 01:02:49,760
[SPEAKER_05]: Nike, just do it.

820
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:51,862
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to type in the slogan or whatever.

821
01:02:52,302 --> 01:03:14,121
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway, talking about also consolidating more attention that's diffused otherwise on multiple devices Xbox One will make it easier to port real-time fantasy football data into the TV screen as people watch their NFL games It does sound kind of interesting, I know some people that are really into fantasy football and I can sort of see that Wait, was a Kinect going to help do that?

822
01:03:14,966 --> 01:03:19,149
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the Xbox One does that because it's that whole like... I was going to say, how is the Kinect supposed to do that?

823
01:03:19,309 --> 01:03:25,153
[SPEAKER_05]: But you can watch the TV in like the three quarters window and then around the edge kind of has your gamify or whatever.

824
01:03:25,173 --> 01:03:32,598
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but I'm just trying to figure out how the Kinect is actually going to enhance something that basically I could feed into it normally.

825
01:03:32,658 --> 01:03:44,806
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just saying, like, unless is it going to recognize that, you know, say I'm following, you know, my team of players because it knows my face and so that's going to display those stats and I don't know.

826
01:03:45,747 --> 01:03:53,753
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, anyway, some of this chat led people to believe that, oh, they're going to harvest ad data through the connect.

827
01:03:54,254 --> 01:03:57,777
[SPEAKER_05]: But Microsoft came out after all of this and said, hold on.

828
01:03:57,997 --> 01:04:00,158
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, this is not what we're doing.

829
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:04,462
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, it just said nobody is working on that.

830
01:04:04,482 --> 01:04:05,783
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not something that happened.

831
01:04:05,823 --> 01:04:08,505
[SPEAKER_05]: It is not going to happen without the user having control over it.

832
01:04:09,086 --> 01:04:09,246
[SPEAKER_05]: But

833
01:04:09,787 --> 01:04:10,888
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

834
01:04:24,144 --> 01:04:28,687
[SPEAKER_05]: but there's some people out there that have that distrust and question that corporate stuff.

835
01:04:28,707 --> 01:04:49,021
[SPEAKER_02]: It probably comes from the fact that there's all these dirty rumors out there of all these horrible things that Microsoft could possibly be doing and then they came out and said, yep, we're going to do all that and then Sony said, nope, we're not going to do all that and then Microsoft said, no, we're actually not going to do that now and we're not going to do that now and we're not going to do that now because you people don't like it.

836
01:04:50,061 --> 01:04:52,683
[SPEAKER_02]: But we may implement those features in the future.

837
01:04:55,885 --> 01:05:00,008
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's the whole flip-flopping that makes people kind of unwary about that stuff.

838
01:05:01,409 --> 01:05:05,172
[SPEAKER_02]: I think... I mean, what... I don't know.

839
01:05:06,173 --> 01:05:11,777
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess concerning would have been the features that, okay, we can recognize individual people.

840
01:05:11,817 --> 01:05:16,781
[SPEAKER_02]: We can cater ads based on those people that happen to be sitting in front of the screen.

841
01:05:16,801 --> 01:05:22,645
[SPEAKER_02]: We can recognize whether they're looking at the ad because we can see where their eyes are looking or something like that.

842
01:05:22,745 --> 01:05:23,206
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, or...

843
01:05:24,427 --> 01:05:26,869
[SPEAKER_02]: How long they're engaged in watching that kind of stuff.

844
01:05:26,889 --> 01:05:28,471
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of this has to do with patents too.

845
01:05:28,891 --> 01:05:39,122
[SPEAKER_05]: It causes a lot of buzz going on through because I remember when, wasn't it Microsoft that has that patent for it can detect who is actually watching the film and lock...

846
01:05:39,662 --> 01:05:40,322
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

847
01:06:03,587 --> 01:06:05,868
[SPEAKER_05]: But I seem to recall that was an issue like a year ago on the show.

848
01:06:05,888 --> 01:06:12,691
[SPEAKER_02]: But didn't they try doing gamification of stuff with Kinect and like these stupid interactive ads and stuff through Kinect on the Microsoft?

849
01:06:13,191 --> 01:06:19,775
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's funny you say that because TigerClawedChat at live.vognetwork.com says, you think they'll have achievements just for watching an ad?

850
01:06:20,875 --> 01:06:24,937
[SPEAKER_05]: And DarkSakura, you're responding to him in chat talking about Gaia Online, which kind of does something like that.

851
01:06:25,515 --> 01:06:29,839
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you like get Gaia Gold for doing surveys and watching their stupid little ads.

852
01:06:30,279 --> 01:06:31,680
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to do Gaia back in the day.

853
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:39,186
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I think, okay, well, maybe Microsoft doesn't necessarily have that yet, but you got achievements from playing those Burger King games.

854
01:06:39,587 --> 01:06:42,209
[SPEAKER_05]: There was achievements in Yaris, which was an Adver game.

855
01:06:42,549 --> 01:06:44,711
[SPEAKER_02]: Burger King games were just genius.

856
01:06:45,211 --> 01:06:47,152
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, yeah, the Burger King games were really like the greatest.

857
01:06:47,172 --> 01:06:54,557
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm very disappointed that there's no new Burger King games because they were creepy in their own way and it was just, it was fun.

858
01:06:55,278 --> 01:07:04,964
[SPEAKER_05]: But besides all of that, I also think though that Microsoft has said there's going to be an achievement for like day one Xbox purchasing, like a day one adopter achievement.

859
01:07:05,205 --> 01:07:11,529
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I mean, that might not be advertising per se, but they are definitely willing to put achievements in things that are not games.

860
01:07:11,549 --> 01:07:11,729
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

861
01:07:13,376 --> 01:07:13,817
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they are.

862
01:07:14,337 --> 01:07:18,383
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they were talking about TV watching and stuff like that as part of an achievement.

863
01:07:18,423 --> 01:07:21,067
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus, remember now, Xbox rewards and stuff.

864
01:07:21,087 --> 01:07:23,130
[SPEAKER_02]: They give you rewards for doing different things.

865
01:07:23,491 --> 01:07:25,914
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's to say they couldn't give you rewards for watching ads?

866
01:07:27,253 --> 01:07:34,936
[SPEAKER_05]: Codeman in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, it's not that we need less marketing, it's that we need more less annoying marketing.

867
01:07:35,456 --> 01:07:37,077
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, let me ask this tough question.

868
01:07:37,617 --> 01:07:38,317
[SPEAKER_05]: What is that?

869
01:07:38,697 --> 01:07:41,478
[SPEAKER_05]: Then what is marketing that is not annoying?

870
01:07:41,998 --> 01:07:43,319
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's a tough question to answer.

871
01:07:43,619 --> 01:07:50,802
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I think whenever a lot of people feel like they're being kind of like pandered to or marketed to, they might feel a little bit annoyed.

872
01:07:50,862 --> 01:07:51,922
[SPEAKER_05]: So what's not annoying?

873
01:07:52,583 --> 01:08:08,219
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually don't mind product placement in a game or in a movie as long as it's not obtrusive like you know the billboards and crazy taxis what I think of or take me to KFC you know like I didn't I wasn't annoyed with that I actually found it funny it was kind of funny

874
01:08:08,679 --> 01:08:24,262
[SPEAKER_01]: or you know it's stuff that you see in real life you know you're driving through the town you may see an ad for you know like a racing game they have all the Valvoline and Forelli and all that you know that's what you see at an actual racing track that's realistic advertising in the game

875
01:08:25,163 --> 01:08:33,805
[SPEAKER_01]: or, you know, for example, character walks into, you know, a snack room and goes to a Pepsi machine and gets a Diet Pepsi.

876
01:08:34,545 --> 01:08:36,166
[SPEAKER_01]: That's unobtrusive marketing.

877
01:08:36,366 --> 01:08:38,086
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something that would happen in real life.

878
01:08:38,146 --> 01:08:38,666
[SPEAKER_02]: It all depends.

879
01:08:38,726 --> 01:08:51,449
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I've seen people complain about that kind of stuff in, you know, games where they'll have, you know, Mountain Dew or something and it's like, it's the year 2205 or something ridiculous, you know, in the future and there's all these Mountain Dew machines everywhere.

880
01:08:51,969 --> 01:09:14,257
[SPEAKER_02]: I think like if you want to do I think people need to feel because right now they feel okay we're being charged for online and now we're also being advertised to at the same time because look at the PlayStation Network they don't really have ads all over the place on the PlayStation you know cross media bar there's not ads just I mean there's a little advertisement ticker thing in the corner we're talking about sales and stuff of games

881
01:09:14,577 --> 01:09:15,337
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

882
01:09:38,823 --> 01:09:50,051
[SPEAKER_02]: You have Microsoft that's charging for online, Sony that's not charging for online, there's no ads there, and Microsoft, on top of charging you, they're also throwing ads in your face.

883
01:09:50,612 --> 01:09:59,278
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether it be in a corner of the screen, and you don't necessarily have to see it, but it's still there, and people are like, what the fuck?

884
01:09:59,778 --> 01:10:04,181
[SPEAKER_02]: Aren't you getting enough money from me already, and now you're making ad dollars on top of that?

885
01:10:04,922 --> 01:10:06,463
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's kind of where the problem is.

886
01:10:07,123 --> 01:10:11,365
[SPEAKER_05]: Zinacor in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, Beer commercials are awesome marketing.

887
01:10:11,745 --> 01:10:14,005
[SPEAKER_05]: Most interesting man in the world is awesome marketing.

888
01:10:14,306 --> 01:10:20,027
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, that kind of had me thinking is that, well, you know, it is very interesting when we talk about marketing vices, especially things like beer.

889
01:10:20,328 --> 01:10:26,990
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, who has traditionally had, you know, Budweiser has had some of the, like, biggest commercials you can possibly think of out there in history.

890
01:10:27,310 --> 01:10:31,791
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I kind of think of, you know what's really fascinating, and this is kind of an unpopular opinion.

891
01:10:31,811 --> 01:10:32,652
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not saying it's good.

892
01:10:32,672 --> 01:10:36,413
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just saying it's fascinating, is that look at the history of cigarette advertising.

893
01:10:36,753 --> 01:10:36,973
[SPEAKER_05]: Blenstones!

894
01:10:51,002 --> 01:10:58,665
[SPEAKER_05]: Not like professionally, but I can think of what I saw when I was a kid back when there were vending machines in restaurants and what I see now, which is hardly anything.

895
01:10:58,685 --> 01:11:01,607
[SPEAKER_01]: Before that, they used to do Marlboro ads featuring the Flintstones.

896
01:11:01,627 --> 01:11:04,428
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like, Marlboro's tastes good, like a cigarette should.

897
01:11:04,948 --> 01:11:09,990
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they would have doctor endorsements in magazines prior to the 60s.

898
01:11:10,811 --> 01:11:15,553
[SPEAKER_01]: They would have actual written doctor endorsements for cigarettes being good for you.

899
01:11:15,813 --> 01:11:16,033
[SPEAKER_01]: Mm-hmm.

900
01:11:17,154 --> 01:11:21,280
[SPEAKER_01]: and of course now truth in advertising is a really, really big thing.

901
01:11:21,881 --> 01:11:27,870
[SPEAKER_01]: So of course we don't have that anymore nor do we have the television ads.

902
01:11:28,351 --> 01:11:31,015
[SPEAKER_01]: Although I have seen those little vending machines repurposed.

903
01:11:31,937 --> 01:11:32,617
[SPEAKER_05]: I have two.

904
01:11:32,978 --> 01:11:36,279
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's kind of funny how they'll put those old cigarette machines to use.

905
01:11:36,579 --> 01:11:43,182
[SPEAKER_01]: I think at the Crocker Museum, they actually do replicas of some of the art pieces in small scale.

906
01:11:43,282 --> 01:11:47,964
[SPEAKER_05]: Or the flip, because they don't really make cigarette vending machines anymore, at least not in California.

907
01:11:48,024 --> 01:11:56,608
[SPEAKER_05]: If you go to a bar where they do sell cigarettes in the outdoor area, which is the only place you can smoke, it's like the type of vending machine that sells chips and cookies in other places.

908
01:11:57,048 --> 01:11:58,549
[SPEAKER_05]: It's fascinating to me.

909
01:11:58,729 --> 01:12:02,370
[SPEAKER_01]: I miss the old cigarette machine aesthetic, even if I don't agree with the product.

910
01:12:02,510 --> 01:12:03,311
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

911
01:12:03,451 --> 01:12:05,571
[SPEAKER_05]: No, the old cigarette machine, I should say that.

912
01:12:05,611 --> 01:12:06,172
[SPEAKER_01]: They were just so neat.

913
01:12:06,192 --> 01:12:07,132
[SPEAKER_01]: They were kind of cool.

914
01:12:07,152 --> 01:12:09,873
[SPEAKER_05]: You pull the knob and out come your smokes.

915
01:12:09,893 --> 01:12:12,534
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's also marketing in a way.

916
01:12:12,554 --> 01:12:12,954
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.

917
01:12:13,514 --> 01:12:16,795
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's cigarettes that you're not supposed to be having.

918
01:12:16,975 --> 01:12:18,856
[SPEAKER_01]: But keep in mind this.

919
01:12:19,496 --> 01:12:20,777
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember what I mentioned about the Crocker?

920
01:12:21,417 --> 01:12:22,297
[SPEAKER_01]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

921
01:12:38,809 --> 01:12:41,331
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, anyhow, we're getting a little off track here.

922
01:12:41,391 --> 01:12:41,691
[SPEAKER_05]: A little.

923
01:12:42,071 --> 01:12:49,415
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, advertising, who knows what's going to develop in the future as entertainment gets more and more and more interactive.

924
01:12:50,096 --> 01:12:50,996
[SPEAKER_05]: They'll come up with something.

925
01:12:51,597 --> 01:12:53,558
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, DarkSakura, before we get to release dates.

926
01:12:54,258 --> 01:12:56,419
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man, Reginator, I am not going to quote Dennis Leary.

927
01:12:56,700 --> 01:12:59,001
[SPEAKER_01]: Except for, what is it?

928
01:12:59,661 --> 01:13:00,122
[SPEAKER_01]: You have the...

929
01:13:00,970 --> 01:13:02,891
[SPEAKER_05]: How about life's gonna suck when you grow up?

930
01:13:03,011 --> 01:13:03,771
[SPEAKER_05]: What is it?

931
01:13:04,471 --> 01:13:08,192
[SPEAKER_01]: You have the orgasm, you smoke the butt, you eat a cookie, you go to bed, and that's the end of the story.

932
01:13:09,453 --> 01:13:09,773
[SPEAKER_01]: About what?

933
01:13:09,893 --> 01:13:10,613
[SPEAKER_01]: The meaning of happiness.

934
01:13:10,813 --> 01:13:11,033
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway.

935
01:13:13,174 --> 01:13:17,135
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, oh yeah, and the, uh, I only want to eat meat from cows that smoke.

936
01:13:17,936 --> 01:13:18,456
[SPEAKER_01]: Moo!

937
01:13:18,756 --> 01:13:18,956
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

938
01:13:19,336 --> 01:13:20,277
[SPEAKER_05]: Video games.

939
01:13:20,517 --> 01:13:21,197
[SPEAKER_01]: Silent Hill.

940
01:13:21,457 --> 01:13:22,297
[SPEAKER_01]: How about Silent Hill?

941
01:13:22,657 --> 01:13:22,797
[SPEAKER_05]: Ah!

942
01:13:24,678 --> 01:13:27,519
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm gonna have to smoke just to get through that game, my god.

943
01:13:27,779 --> 01:13:28,159
[SPEAKER_01]: Just kidding.

944
01:13:28,759 --> 01:13:29,800
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't you know that's what the fog is?

945
01:13:30,820 --> 01:13:48,394
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, WayForward did Silent Hill Book of Memories, and it turns out that before they did Contra 4, they had a prototype out for another Silent Hill game for the Nintendo DS.

946
01:13:49,215 --> 01:13:52,258
[SPEAKER_01]: And their little prototype starred the dude from Silent Hill 2.

947
01:13:53,478 --> 01:14:06,424
[SPEAKER_01]: and there was some video out about it about what it was supposed to look like but of course that got cancelled and they also had and this makes me think back to the whole Biohazard 1.5 where

948
01:14:10,186 --> 01:14:18,049
[SPEAKER_01]: They had a completely different version of Silent Hill Book of Memories and ended up, I suppose, scrapping it and doing it what we have now.

949
01:14:19,089 --> 01:14:25,252
[SPEAKER_01]: But the quote on there was saying is that they had two different perspectives for in the game.

950
01:14:25,852 --> 01:14:29,213
[SPEAKER_01]: This one would switch between an isometric and an over the shoulder.

951
01:14:30,514 --> 01:14:33,615
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were looking more at the combat and puzzle side.

952
01:14:35,426 --> 01:14:43,174
[SPEAKER_01]: Elements to zoom out, but they said that the technology just wasn't there to do it, so they switched how they did it.

953
01:14:44,375 --> 01:14:51,802
[SPEAKER_01]: But there is a video out there of what the, I'd say, original concept of Chain of Memories was, for anyone who's interested in it.

954
01:14:52,143 --> 01:14:53,624
[SPEAKER_01]: Which for me, I love...

955
01:14:55,826 --> 01:14:58,009
[SPEAKER_01]: I love looking at prototypes and the differences.

956
01:14:58,249 --> 01:15:04,836
[SPEAKER_01]: I would still love to find a playable Biohazard 1.5 just so that I could see for myself what the differences were.

957
01:15:05,736 --> 01:15:11,943
[SPEAKER_01]: But I love when they come out and say, well, this is what you almost got, unless what we almost got would have been better.

958
01:15:12,363 --> 01:15:12,884
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?

959
01:15:13,624 --> 01:15:17,829
[SPEAKER_01]: But I wouldn't have minded having a good solid Silent Hill game on my DS.

960
01:15:20,447 --> 01:15:22,829
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Book of Memories got a lot of kind of hate, though.

961
01:15:22,949 --> 01:15:27,973
[SPEAKER_05]: It wasn't... See, the thing with Book of Memories, like, I didn't hate the game, but it wasn't Silent Hill to me.

962
01:15:28,233 --> 01:15:32,937
[SPEAKER_05]: It was very much not Silent Hill to me, which it was definitely, like, more of, like, a spin-off type of game.

963
01:15:33,098 --> 01:15:37,181
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't wanted to play a Silent Hill game since Homecoming.

964
01:15:37,201 --> 01:15:41,885
[SPEAKER_01]: I honestly think that Homecoming is the last... I'm not even going to say great Silent Hill game.

965
01:15:41,945 --> 01:15:44,607
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of the last good, faithful Silent Hill games to me.

966
01:15:45,488 --> 01:15:45,668
[SPEAKER_01]: So...

967
01:15:47,415 --> 01:15:52,317
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, well, let's travel around the world and check out release dates of games that will, you know, actually be coming out.

968
01:15:53,197 --> 01:15:59,800
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's pretty good that Silent Hill game didn't come out, because if you remember correctly, all the portable Silent Hill games haven't been very good.

969
01:16:00,160 --> 01:16:01,820
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you remember the PSP ones and stuff?

970
01:16:02,581 --> 01:16:05,402
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just... I never really played the PSP one.

971
01:16:05,422 --> 01:16:05,982
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember it, though.

972
01:16:06,022 --> 01:16:07,423
[SPEAKER_05]: That was Origins, right?

973
01:16:08,803 --> 01:16:10,384
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, yeah.

974
01:16:10,404 --> 01:16:10,944
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm confusing.

975
01:16:10,984 --> 01:16:13,545
[SPEAKER_02]: There's that PSP one and the... They ported it to PS2.

976
01:16:14,688 --> 01:16:15,288
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.

977
01:16:15,468 --> 01:16:16,429
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

978
01:16:16,729 --> 01:16:19,470
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, this week, not a whole ton of stuff coming out.

979
01:16:19,490 --> 01:16:22,312
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more of like a catch-up week, I guess.

980
01:16:23,092 --> 01:16:26,794
[SPEAKER_02]: So, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Wii.

981
01:16:27,474 --> 01:16:33,397
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you like hunting because Cabela's African Adventures will be coming out this week.

982
01:16:33,977 --> 01:16:37,118
[SPEAKER_02]: Also on... What was it?

983
01:16:37,439 --> 01:16:40,500
[SPEAKER_02]: PlayStation 3 as well.

984
01:16:40,520 --> 01:16:41,881
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see here.

985
01:16:41,941 --> 01:16:42,601
[SPEAKER_02]: We had...

986
01:16:45,660 --> 01:16:49,283
[SPEAKER_02]: Wipeout, Create, and Crash on Wii U, 3DS, Wii, Xbox 360, and of course the Xbox 360 one is a Kinect game.

987
01:16:49,703 --> 01:16:52,125
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, what else was there this week?

988
01:16:52,145 --> 01:16:53,165
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously, not a lot of anything.

989
01:16:53,205 --> 01:16:54,226
[SPEAKER_02]: That can't be it.

990
01:17:15,475 --> 01:17:15,936
[SPEAKER_02]: You alright?

991
01:17:16,919 --> 01:17:19,024
[SPEAKER_02]: There's just not a lot of... There's a lot of garbage coming out.

992
01:17:19,064 --> 01:17:19,565
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, here we go.

993
01:17:20,387 --> 01:17:21,570
[SPEAKER_02]: You're just weeding through the garbage right now?

994
01:17:21,590 --> 01:17:23,073
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm weeding through the garbage, yeah, because...

995
01:17:25,229 --> 01:17:32,294
[SPEAKER_02]: And last two things this week, Cradle of Egypt 2 for 3DS and Girls Fashion Shoot on 3DS.

996
01:17:33,815 --> 01:17:35,236
[SPEAKER_02]: That's literally it.

997
01:17:36,657 --> 01:17:37,077
[SPEAKER_05]: Alrighty.

998
01:17:38,078 --> 01:17:41,600
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, going to Japan and checking out what is coming out in Japan this week.

999
01:17:41,620 --> 01:17:42,581
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we hang out with Irene?

1000
01:17:42,621 --> 01:17:42,861
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we?

1001
01:17:42,901 --> 01:17:43,101
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we?

1002
01:17:43,141 --> 01:17:43,361
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we?

1003
01:17:43,662 --> 01:17:48,505
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I should have called her and been like, hey, I hate to interrupt your honeymoon and God knows what's going on right now.

1004
01:17:48,965 --> 01:17:49,125
[SPEAKER_05]: But...

1005
01:17:50,266 --> 01:17:51,907
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there lines for another Monster Hunter?

1006
01:17:51,927 --> 01:17:53,809
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, I gotta ask you, what's on the shelves over there?

1007
01:17:54,550 --> 01:17:56,891
[SPEAKER_05]: We do have to get her and Silent Nathan back on the show though, miss them.

1008
01:17:57,452 --> 01:18:02,196
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, coming out on October 17th on the PlayStation 3 over in Japan.

1009
01:18:02,536 --> 01:18:04,778
[SPEAKER_05]: Beyond Two Souls is getting its release in Japan.

1010
01:18:04,818 --> 01:18:07,360
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the first print limited edition as well as regular.

1011
01:18:08,180 --> 01:18:11,423
[SPEAKER_05]: FIFA 14, World Class Soccer and some various editions.

1012
01:18:12,504 --> 01:18:15,806
[SPEAKER_05]: Saint Seiya, Brave Soldiers in regular and limited editions.

1013
01:18:15,826 --> 01:18:16,226
[SPEAKER_01]: No way.

1014
01:18:16,687 --> 01:18:16,967
[SPEAKER_05]: Way.

1015
01:18:17,067 --> 01:18:18,108
[SPEAKER_01]: They're doing a Saint Seiya game?

1016
01:18:18,688 --> 01:18:19,249
[SPEAKER_05]: Brave Soldiers.

1017
01:18:19,609 --> 01:18:20,949
[SPEAKER_01]: Good lord, that's an old series.

1018
01:18:21,890 --> 01:18:24,831
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's coming out on the PlayStation 3.

1019
01:18:26,152 --> 01:18:28,533
[SPEAKER_05]: Coming out on the Xbox 360 this week in Japan.

1020
01:18:29,914 --> 01:18:31,975
[SPEAKER_05]: FIFA 14, because you know that game is huge.

1021
01:18:32,275 --> 01:18:36,257
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's like Xbox Live card kind of pack-ins to go with that.

1022
01:18:37,217 --> 01:18:40,299
[SPEAKER_05]: On the Vita this week, FIFA 14 is there as well.

1023
01:18:41,059 --> 01:18:43,520
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm thinking the FIFA 14 is kind of a big release this week.

1024
01:18:44,080 --> 01:18:49,582
[SPEAKER_05]: But on the Wii U, it's all about Rayman Legends, which sees its release in Japan this week on October the 17th.

1025
01:18:50,742 --> 01:18:52,382
[SPEAKER_05]: Lastly, checking the 3DS here.

1026
01:18:53,663 --> 01:18:58,324
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, not a lot of stuff this week, probably just because they're coming off the Pokemon High.

1027
01:18:58,364 --> 01:19:00,525
[SPEAKER_05]: There's still a lot of cases and...

1028
01:19:00,885 --> 01:19:01,825
[SPEAKER_05]: Accessories and things.

1029
01:19:02,146 --> 01:19:06,007
[SPEAKER_05]: But there is one game coming out from Namco Bandai this week.

1030
01:19:06,267 --> 01:19:07,988
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm going to butcher this name.

1031
01:19:08,488 --> 01:19:14,050
[SPEAKER_05]: It is Sentotuchu Densetsu no Shinobi 2 Survival Battle.

1032
01:19:15,731 --> 01:19:19,732
[SPEAKER_05]: And all I have is a screenshot and the little subtitle on it is Battle for Money.

1033
01:19:20,092 --> 01:19:23,073
[SPEAKER_05]: So it looks like kind of like a ninja fighting type of game.

1034
01:19:23,373 --> 01:19:24,834
[SPEAKER_05]: It also says Fuji Television.

1035
01:19:24,854 --> 01:19:27,355
[SPEAKER_05]: So I wonder if this isn't based on some type of game show in Japan.

1036
01:19:28,095 --> 01:19:29,316
[SPEAKER_05]: Or maybe it's like a ninja...

1037
01:19:30,990 --> 01:19:31,250
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura

1038
01:19:49,892 --> 01:19:50,592
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let's see.

1039
01:19:50,672 --> 01:19:53,375
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not a whole big pile of stuff coming out.

1040
01:19:53,895 --> 01:19:57,598
[SPEAKER_01]: We have on the 17th, we have Device 6 for iOS.

1041
01:19:58,099 --> 01:20:00,181
[SPEAKER_01]: We have Pocket Titans also for iOS.

1042
01:20:00,761 --> 01:20:02,923
[SPEAKER_01]: And on the 18th, we have Alien Rage.

1043
01:20:03,563 --> 01:20:09,629
[SPEAKER_01]: We have Skylander Swap Force and Skylander... Actually, two different versions of Skylander Swap Force.

1044
01:20:10,149 --> 01:20:11,450
[SPEAKER_01]: Looks like the handheld...

1045
01:20:13,312 --> 01:20:31,186
[SPEAKER_01]: the 3DS, Xbox 360 Wii U, Wii, Playstation 3 and then they're separating their release for the Playstation 4 and the Xbox One so that's it like I said it was a little so small you know everybody's just too busy playing Pokemon except for all of us here at OLR

1046
01:20:33,431 --> 01:20:34,632
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll get in on that craze soon.

1047
01:20:34,692 --> 01:20:42,296
[SPEAKER_01]: I am not going to make poor Isabelle make meth in the basement of my town hall to keep my flowers pretty.

1048
01:20:43,357 --> 01:20:46,058
[SPEAKER_01]: I just got Lobo and I just got Peck and I got Margie.

1049
01:20:46,638 --> 01:20:47,479
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm playing in my village.

1050
01:20:47,619 --> 01:20:50,601
[SPEAKER_05]: Fine, so you refuse to give up one addiction for another.

1051
01:20:51,861 --> 01:20:52,301
[SPEAKER_05]: Bitch, please.

1052
01:20:52,442 --> 01:20:57,024
[SPEAKER_05]: But as I told you, you can't visit my town this week to get petition signatures because my town went to Japan.

1053
01:20:57,804 --> 01:21:00,506
[SPEAKER_05]: My entire town got up and flew to Japan this week.

1054
01:21:00,899 --> 01:21:01,400
[SPEAKER_01]: That's okay.

1055
01:21:01,580 --> 01:21:03,121
[SPEAKER_01]: Actdeft will help me.

1056
01:21:03,221 --> 01:21:08,045
[SPEAKER_05]: Lord knows how Princess Irene is corrupting my villagers at this very moment.

1057
01:21:08,125 --> 01:21:08,825
[SPEAKER_05]: It won't be the same town.

1058
01:21:08,845 --> 01:21:09,746
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to know what's funny?

1059
01:21:09,966 --> 01:21:10,166
[SPEAKER_01]: Huh?

1060
01:21:10,427 --> 01:21:12,468
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that remember how Butch moved from my town to yours?

1061
01:21:12,628 --> 01:21:12,849
[SPEAKER_01]: Mm-hmm.

1062
01:21:13,069 --> 01:21:14,690
[SPEAKER_01]: Butch has been hanging out in my shopping center.

1063
01:21:14,990 --> 01:21:15,331
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, really?

1064
01:21:15,351 --> 01:21:16,551
[SPEAKER_01]: So Butch didn't want to go to Japan.

1065
01:21:20,015 --> 01:21:20,416
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

1066
01:21:21,597 --> 01:21:22,898
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like they're real people.

1067
01:21:23,399 --> 01:21:26,443
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, a few more news stories for you guys in the Classic Game of the Week.

1068
01:21:26,803 --> 01:21:28,745
[SPEAKER_05]: But first, a very new game, right, Loki?

1069
01:21:28,845 --> 01:21:31,068
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the best part about it, is they're not even people.

1070
01:21:31,949 --> 01:21:32,730
[SPEAKER_02]: They're animals.

1071
01:21:34,537 --> 01:21:48,482
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, speaking of addictions, Grand Theft Auto V has officially broken a bunch of records, including the PlayStation Network record for the most downloaded title in history of the PlayStation Network.

1072
01:21:49,643 --> 01:21:52,284
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's also some Guinness Book Records, which...

1073
01:21:53,784 --> 01:21:54,344
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1074
01:21:54,384 --> 01:21:55,245
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyways, let's see.

1075
01:21:55,345 --> 01:21:58,286
[SPEAKER_02]: Best selling action adventure video game in 24 hours.

1076
01:21:58,386 --> 01:22:00,186
[SPEAKER_02]: Best selling video game in 24 hours.

1077
01:22:00,666 --> 01:22:02,007
[SPEAKER_02]: And they really narrow it down.

1078
01:22:03,047 --> 01:22:06,448
[SPEAKER_02]: Fastest entertainment property to gross $1 billion.

1079
01:22:06,828 --> 01:22:09,289
[SPEAKER_02]: Fastest video game to gross $1 billion.

1080
01:22:09,669 --> 01:22:11,670
[SPEAKER_02]: Highest grossing video game in 24 hours.

1081
01:22:11,790 --> 01:22:14,851
[SPEAKER_02]: Highest revenue generated by an entertainment product in 24 hours.

1082
01:22:15,291 --> 01:22:17,932
[SPEAKER_02]: And the most viewed trailer for an action adventure video game.

1083
01:22:20,162 --> 01:22:22,166
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if they really need trailer in there.

1084
01:22:22,206 --> 01:22:26,915
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's just like... Great advertisement.

1085
01:22:26,935 --> 01:22:28,719
[SPEAKER_02]: Can they go too far with like, you know...

1086
01:22:30,339 --> 01:22:33,200
[SPEAKER_02]: Breaking down these records, I mean, I don't know.

1087
01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:35,180
[SPEAKER_02]: This is all press release fodder.

1088
01:22:35,280 --> 01:22:45,803
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it is, although I shouldn't belittle some of these accomplishments, because obviously, Grand Theft Auto, whether you like it or not, or like it too much or not, it is a huge thing in the gaming industry.

1089
01:22:45,963 --> 01:22:46,303
[SPEAKER_05]: Huge.

1090
01:22:46,523 --> 01:22:48,883
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, these records do back that up.

1091
01:22:50,444 --> 01:22:50,904
[SPEAKER_05]: Practically...

1092
01:22:51,124 --> 01:22:51,544
[SPEAKER_05]: Actdeft.com

1093
01:23:13,895 --> 01:23:20,824
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually remember way back the David Chappelle show where he did the Grand Theft Auto parody with the gun switching.

1094
01:23:20,884 --> 01:23:22,506
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, if your life was Grand Theft Auto.

1095
01:23:22,746 --> 01:23:23,467
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that was funny.

1096
01:23:23,587 --> 01:23:24,107
[SPEAKER_02]: That was pretty funny.

1097
01:23:24,208 --> 01:23:24,708
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember that.

1098
01:23:25,049 --> 01:23:25,389
[SPEAKER_02]: Good stuff.

1099
01:23:26,310 --> 01:23:31,757
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, Grand Theft Auto Online, there's been some hiccups, but they almost have it all taken care of.

1100
01:23:32,017 --> 01:23:32,698
[SPEAKER_02]: And to kind of...

1101
01:23:33,078 --> 01:23:36,723
[SPEAKER_02]: Compensate players and maybe get people more interested in checking out online.

1102
01:23:37,183 --> 01:23:46,715
[SPEAKER_02]: If you played any portion of the online in the month of October, you get a half a million dollars in in-game money.

1103
01:23:47,056 --> 01:23:50,901
[SPEAKER_02]: That's in-game money, not an actual half a million dollars.

1104
01:23:51,241 --> 01:23:51,662
[SPEAKER_05]: I wish.

1105
01:23:51,822 --> 01:23:54,326
[SPEAKER_05]: That'd be awesome.

1106
01:23:54,606 --> 01:24:03,440
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of the headlines I saw out there was GTA to give their players a half million dollars and then you click on the link and then the sub headline is in-game cash.

1107
01:24:03,580 --> 01:24:04,041
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course.

1108
01:24:04,101 --> 01:24:05,282
[SPEAKER_05]: You cheap bastard.

1109
01:24:05,643 --> 01:24:06,584
[SPEAKER_05]: Click me, click me.

1110
01:24:07,845 --> 01:24:10,387
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, you have to play during the month of October.

1111
01:24:11,547 --> 01:24:21,511
[SPEAKER_02]: You will have to also install the upcoming title update 1.04, which is going to fix some other problems and causing vehicle purchase losses and stuff like that.

1112
01:24:22,592 --> 01:24:26,234
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's going to be two deposits of $250,000.

1113
01:24:27,334 --> 01:24:31,836
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure when those are going to be coming.

1114
01:24:31,856 --> 01:24:34,377
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if it's right after each other or if it's just...

1115
01:24:36,378 --> 01:24:37,958
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't know how to do it, but that's cool.

1116
01:24:38,038 --> 01:24:38,378
[SPEAKER_02]: More money.

1117
01:24:39,459 --> 01:24:39,899
[SPEAKER_02]: Money's good.

1118
01:24:42,779 --> 01:24:45,320
[SPEAKER_02]: Then, of course, you know, this is interesting.

1119
01:24:46,280 --> 01:25:03,184
[SPEAKER_02]: This sort of happened with Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, except it wasn't necessarily that an artist was trying to sue the game because their music was being used without their permission, but it was because they thought the game was based off of their lifestyle, but

1120
01:25:03,704 --> 01:25:08,706
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, there's an artist saying that he wants his music taken out of the game.

1121
01:25:08,746 --> 01:25:11,487
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's Daz Dillinger.

1122
01:25:12,067 --> 01:25:20,130
[SPEAKER_02]: And he has a couple tracks in there with, I guess, Corrupt under the group banner, The Dog Pound.

1123
01:25:20,911 --> 01:25:22,051
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there's two tracks.

1124
01:25:22,091 --> 01:25:25,152
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's saying that he was offered $4,271 for his songs.

1125
01:25:25,192 --> 01:25:25,773
[SPEAKER_02]: But then, I guess...

1126
01:25:32,936 --> 01:25:37,719
[SPEAKER_02]: And now he's pissed off that he feels because they made a billion dollars that he wants more money or something.

1127
01:25:37,739 --> 01:25:37,899
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

1128
01:25:51,849 --> 01:25:53,690
[SPEAKER_05]: Unless there's something specifically in his contract about royalties.

1129
01:26:07,096 --> 01:26:08,477
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1130
01:26:28,650 --> 01:26:30,691
[SPEAKER_05]: Are they necessary to the plot?

1131
01:26:30,831 --> 01:26:31,052
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

1132
01:26:31,232 --> 01:26:35,514
[SPEAKER_05]: Like the Kanye song in Saints Row 3.

1133
01:26:35,955 --> 01:26:37,596
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't do that scene without the song.

1134
01:26:37,636 --> 01:26:38,956
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really awesome.

1135
01:26:38,997 --> 01:26:39,597
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

1136
01:26:39,617 --> 01:26:40,337
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to have certain songs.

1137
01:26:40,577 --> 01:26:42,479
[SPEAKER_05]: But are those songs necessary?

1138
01:26:42,539 --> 01:26:43,599
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's just on the radio.

1139
01:26:43,639 --> 01:26:47,282
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing, too, is that he broke with those groups.

1140
01:26:47,802 --> 01:26:48,022
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1141
01:26:48,362 --> 01:26:52,105
[SPEAKER_01]: So the guy's actually not... Unless it has to be some sort of bitterness association...

1142
01:26:52,965 --> 01:26:54,606
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I fell out with them.

1143
01:26:54,626 --> 01:26:55,207
[SPEAKER_01]: They owe me money.

1144
01:26:55,767 --> 01:27:05,274
[SPEAKER_05]: But I mean, there's probably tons of independent rap artists to get featured in a Grand Theft Auto game that would like, they would pay rock star money to have that opportunity.

1145
01:27:05,314 --> 01:27:06,475
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some good artists in there.

1146
01:27:06,495 --> 01:27:14,400
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, I started listening to some of the other stations because I was just listening to the classic rock station and actually I've been listening to the pop station now even though Britney's on there.

1147
01:27:14,420 --> 01:27:17,302
[SPEAKER_02]: You have a Britney Spears song in Grand Theft Auto.

1148
01:27:17,483 --> 01:27:19,284
[SPEAKER_02]: They have Gimme More.

1149
01:27:19,304 --> 01:27:20,645
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1150
01:27:21,025 --> 01:27:22,406
[SPEAKER_05]: That is one of my favorites, not gonna lie.

1151
01:27:22,426 --> 01:27:24,988
[SPEAKER_01]: Dan was listening to the 70s station, that was hilarious.

1152
01:27:26,069 --> 01:27:30,352
[SPEAKER_05]: I was hoping they'd have Work Bitch, because I just, you know, love that song.

1153
01:27:30,392 --> 01:27:33,174
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I saw that advertisement on YouTube the other day.

1154
01:27:33,194 --> 01:27:35,635
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, what have you become, Brittany?

1155
01:27:35,695 --> 01:27:38,317
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, seriously, this whole reinvention of yourself.

1156
01:27:38,357 --> 01:27:40,519
[SPEAKER_02]: Call the governor.

1157
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:49,105
[SPEAKER_02]: There's actually some good songs, like on Radio Mirror Park, they have, it's all these independent guys, I guess, and they have a...

1158
01:27:51,922 --> 01:27:54,725
[SPEAKER_02]: A synth-pop track that I put in my car.

1159
01:27:54,745 --> 01:28:03,012
[SPEAKER_02]: It was actually the one that was in the last trailer that they did for the game.

1160
01:28:04,834 --> 01:28:08,517
[SPEAKER_02]: It was Sleepwalking by the Chain Gang of 1974.

1161
01:28:10,198 --> 01:28:13,101
[SPEAKER_02]: Great, great artists that I discovered through the game.

1162
01:28:14,042 --> 01:28:14,502
[SPEAKER_02]: And so...

1163
01:28:16,758 --> 01:28:18,439
[SPEAKER_02]: See, that's what I like about this game.

1164
01:28:38,106 --> 01:29:00,167
[SPEAKER_02]: and well and this show was founded on DDR and I know I found so many artists through DDR especially the the ultimate and if anything if you happen to not be familiar with the slight musical interlude that Eddie Murphy took part in you get the wonderful track of party all the time on there which is it's always fantastic pretty bad it's fantastic so that's worth it right there

1165
01:29:00,487 --> 01:29:01,928
[SPEAKER_05]: And some very exciting news.

1166
01:29:01,948 --> 01:29:03,950
[SPEAKER_05]: The guy that does the voice of Franklin, Sean Fontenot,

1167
01:29:20,983 --> 01:29:44,856
[SPEAKER_02]: Sean Fontino, he is working on a project with the voice actor from San Andreas who did the voice of CJ Young Marley and basically this came up I guess at the New York Comic Con panel and they were asking him questions on it but he dodged the questions and changed the subject so

1168
01:29:45,876 --> 01:29:52,924
[SPEAKER_02]: The thoughts may be, you know, the thought, at least I had from that is, ooh, CJ's coming back to San Andreas.

1169
01:29:53,145 --> 01:29:58,631
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty exciting, even though they said that the whole universe that takes place before 4 doesn't really exist.

1170
01:29:58,971 --> 01:30:00,193
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't think it's really exciting.

1171
01:30:00,813 --> 01:30:04,758
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, CJ may make a return, even though he would be like,

1172
01:30:06,343 --> 01:30:10,527
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope that's some DLC coming because that would be pretty cool

1173
01:30:23,496 --> 01:30:28,839
[SPEAKER_01]: By the way, Dan showed me something in Grand Theft Auto that actually completely had me in stitches.

1174
01:30:29,539 --> 01:30:35,842
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the war vet that hangs out in front of that house by the fence who talks all the conspiracy theory stuff.

1175
01:30:36,082 --> 01:30:36,582
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, yeah.

1176
01:30:37,583 --> 01:30:40,084
[SPEAKER_01]: I sat and listened to that for like 30 minutes.

1177
01:30:40,965 --> 01:30:41,725
[SPEAKER_01]: It was freaking funny.

1178
01:30:42,685 --> 01:30:43,566
[SPEAKER_01]: And sad, and sad.

1179
01:30:44,602 --> 01:30:49,925
[SPEAKER_05]: So going to our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com, there's some other chat about great celebrity crossover songs.

1180
01:30:50,305 --> 01:30:53,507
[SPEAKER_05]: Dungeon Buster says Don Johnson's Heartbeat is also in there.

1181
01:30:53,647 --> 01:31:00,511
[SPEAKER_02]: They totally ripped from the one-hit wonders countdown that they did on VH1 a while back.

1182
01:31:01,551 --> 01:31:05,874
[SPEAKER_05]: And then Bobby Blackwolf brought up this truly, truly classic song.

1183
01:31:10,723 --> 01:31:16,014
[SPEAKER_05]: The Ballad of Bilbo Baggins by Leonard Nimoy Did you watch that commercial with him and Zachary Quinto?

1184
01:31:21,402 --> 01:31:22,183
[SPEAKER_05]: That sounds familiar.

1185
01:31:22,263 --> 01:31:27,325
[SPEAKER_01]: They're each in their own car trying to get to play golf.

1186
01:31:28,085 --> 01:31:33,388
[SPEAKER_01]: And while he's driving, he's singing the song in his car.

1187
01:31:33,588 --> 01:31:39,190
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's not forget Shatner had at least two albums of him singing all of the hits.

1188
01:31:39,931 --> 01:31:41,211
[SPEAKER_01]: Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.

1189
01:31:43,192 --> 01:31:45,876
[SPEAKER_05]: Dragon Quest Series Dragon Quest Series

1190
01:31:59,913 --> 01:32:05,195
[SPEAKER_05]: All eight games, or the first eight, because technically I think there's ten of them now with the online one.

1191
01:32:05,215 --> 01:32:09,237
[SPEAKER_05]: The first eight games are going to be coming out for iOS and Android.

1192
01:32:09,637 --> 01:32:12,658
[SPEAKER_05]: Dragon Quest 1 will be out this year, getting it all started.

1193
01:32:12,678 --> 01:32:17,961
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a teaser site out there saying that it will be coming out for iOS and Android, in Japan at least, in the winter.

1194
01:32:18,281 --> 01:32:22,022
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't know how much that will cost, but if it's Square Enix, you can count on a premium.

1195
01:32:23,983 --> 01:32:25,826
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't know which versions of the game either.

1196
01:32:26,246 --> 01:32:27,468
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, there you go.

1197
01:32:28,009 --> 01:32:33,015
[SPEAKER_05]: A new Dragon Quest Monsters game called Super Light is also on the way to iOS and Android.

1198
01:32:33,916 --> 01:32:36,420
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, a lot of people remember Dragon Quest here in America.

1199
01:32:36,440 --> 01:32:39,223
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, we got it as Dragon Warrior, but a lot of people remember...

1200
01:32:40,284 --> 01:32:48,691
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, speaking of magazines, which was kind of the theme of the show earlier, I remember the Nintendo Power, you got the Dragon Warrior Guide with it, right?

1201
01:32:48,731 --> 01:32:49,752
[SPEAKER_05]: Or was that when you bought the game?

1202
01:32:49,932 --> 01:32:52,975
[SPEAKER_05]: You got it with either the game or you got it with a magazine, probably both.

1203
01:32:53,055 --> 01:32:53,775
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's a magazine.

1204
01:32:53,936 --> 01:33:02,883
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you got that Dragon Warrior Guide, and so I know a lot of people really knew that game, so I think there'll be some people to kind of jump on it when it's re-released for iOS later this year, we'll see.

1205
01:33:03,880 --> 01:33:05,581
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, all eight.

1206
01:33:05,721 --> 01:33:07,182
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty crazy.

1207
01:33:07,222 --> 01:33:09,363
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, Dragon Quest VIII was a PlayStation 2 game.

1208
01:33:09,984 --> 01:33:10,884
[SPEAKER_05]: It was really good, too.

1209
01:33:10,904 --> 01:33:12,585
[SPEAKER_05]: It was one of my favorites in the whole series.

1210
01:33:13,346 --> 01:33:16,047
[SPEAKER_05]: Speaking of big Square Enix properties, going to mobile.

1211
01:33:16,067 --> 01:33:17,848
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if you guys heard this.

1212
01:33:18,148 --> 01:33:20,090
[SPEAKER_05]: Final Fantasy VI, confirmed.

1213
01:33:20,250 --> 01:33:22,271
[SPEAKER_05]: It will be coming to iOS and Android this year.

1214
01:33:22,291 --> 01:33:22,351
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay!

1215
01:33:22,931 --> 01:33:44,526
[SPEAKER_05]: and I seem to remember when Final Fantasy 5 came out earlier this year I remember thinking like well this is this is testing the waters for this Final Fantasy 6 will be the next big one and sure enough here it is so they've said in regards to Final Fantasy 6 the battle systems have been altered for the other mobile remakes and Final Fantasy and Final Fantasy 6 will be the same

1216
01:33:45,406 --> 01:33:49,329
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, so, yeah, I guess on the mobile devices, the battle systems have been adjusted.

1217
01:33:49,349 --> 01:33:51,750
[SPEAKER_05]: You won't have to do as much grinding and fighting as much.

1218
01:33:51,790 --> 01:33:53,611
[SPEAKER_05]: You can just enjoy the game straight up.

1219
01:33:53,831 --> 01:33:57,914
[SPEAKER_05]: You won't be able to, you won't have to do one, two step, oh, random battle, one, two.

1220
01:33:57,974 --> 01:33:59,795
[SPEAKER_05]: Some people, that's going to rub some people the wrong way.

1221
01:34:00,015 --> 01:34:03,837
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm very curious to see how Sabin's moves transfer over.

1222
01:34:04,337 --> 01:34:08,160
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, does that mean you're going to have to just kind of use your finger to draw the different patterns?

1223
01:34:08,500 --> 01:34:12,902
[SPEAKER_05]: Because he was the one, like, you actually do quarter circle forward to have him do, like, a big fireball and stuff.

1224
01:34:13,143 --> 01:34:13,563
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember that?

1225
01:34:14,324 --> 01:34:19,608
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I don't know.

1226
01:34:19,849 --> 01:34:21,950
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm very curious to see how some of that translates over.

1227
01:34:23,832 --> 01:34:28,236
[SPEAKER_05]: And also, you know, there was a big conversation on this going on on Twitter this week.

1228
01:34:28,276 --> 01:34:30,878
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I talk a lot with like, you know, Spike from Gameboy.org.

1229
01:34:32,719 --> 01:34:41,942
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's kind of not happy to hear this news because Final Fantasy V, let's just say, cut a few corners when it came to art assets especially.

1230
01:34:41,962 --> 01:34:45,864
[SPEAKER_05]: And in my opinion, the game looks very outsourced in some places.

1231
01:34:46,284 --> 01:34:50,025
[SPEAKER_05]: The art assets aren't as good as they could be and so on.

1232
01:34:50,105 --> 01:34:56,387
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a little bit of concern out there that this translation is probably not going to be very good.

1233
01:34:56,887 --> 01:34:58,648
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's definitely going to be just kind of a cash-in.

1234
01:34:59,568 --> 01:35:02,049
[SPEAKER_05]: I know this is one of my very favorites in the entire series.

1235
01:35:02,809 --> 01:35:07,291
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, what do you think about this Final Fantasy VI coming to iPhone and Android?

1236
01:35:07,311 --> 01:35:10,472
[SPEAKER_05]: I know you like this game a lot.

1237
01:35:10,732 --> 01:35:17,754
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I love the game, but to be honest, I have the cartridge and I have the PlayStation version.

1238
01:35:18,294 --> 01:35:19,895
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's sort of like, I don't need it.

1239
01:35:20,255 --> 01:35:21,576
[SPEAKER_05]: Mm-hmm.

1240
01:35:21,596 --> 01:35:24,538
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes it's still fun to see your old games get remade, though.

1241
01:35:24,578 --> 01:35:26,479
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, when they're good remakes, right?

1242
01:35:26,499 --> 01:35:26,719
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1243
01:35:26,759 --> 01:35:31,562
[SPEAKER_05]: Like a lot of people, I haven't played it yet, but I'm hearing Wind Waker, I'm hearing amazing things about that, you know.

1244
01:35:31,703 --> 01:35:37,646
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm actually getting more to the point where the only thing that I play on my iPhone is freaking Bejeweled or puzzle games.

1245
01:35:38,447 --> 01:35:46,272
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I'm wanting to play a, like, and this is Cody Fingers' legit game, I'm gonna play on my 3DS or I'm gonna play on my PC.

1246
01:35:46,492 --> 01:35:46,652
[SPEAKER_01]: So...

1247
01:35:47,130 --> 01:35:54,956
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, speaking of 3DS, Alan Alchemy in our chatroom says, I want a proper Final Fantasy 5 and Final Fantasy 6 DS or 3DS remake.

1248
01:35:55,056 --> 01:35:55,637
[SPEAKER_05]: God damn it.

1249
01:35:56,017 --> 01:35:58,119
[SPEAKER_05]: None of this iOS HD sprite crap.

1250
01:35:58,439 --> 01:36:03,903
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I think that's where a lot of people are at is because, you know, the 3D remake of Final Fantasy 4 and 3 was pretty good.

1251
01:36:04,023 --> 01:36:06,685
[SPEAKER_05]: So we were hoping to get the same treatment for Final Fantasy 5.

1252
01:36:06,725 --> 01:36:07,066
[SPEAKER_10]: I also...

1253
01:36:07,986 --> 01:36:08,427
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry.

1254
01:36:08,447 --> 01:36:08,947
[SPEAKER_05]: Go ahead, Loki.

1255
01:36:10,208 --> 01:36:10,589
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

1256
01:36:11,149 --> 01:36:12,010
[SPEAKER_05]: Fine, DarkSakura, go.

1257
01:36:12,030 --> 01:36:12,831
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, fine.

1258
01:36:13,071 --> 01:36:14,552
[SPEAKER_01]: I use the power of my boobs to go first.

1259
01:36:15,893 --> 01:36:22,819
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree with Actdeft, Einhander, but I want a full HD version of Einhander, and I want them to do a freaking sequel.

1260
01:36:23,220 --> 01:36:24,161
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, keep on wishing.

1261
01:36:24,481 --> 01:36:25,782
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, I know, but I love that game.

1262
01:36:26,082 --> 01:36:32,188
[SPEAKER_02]: I would settle for a Final Fantasy IV version where they did the after years or whatever, or Final Fantasy VI.

1263
01:36:33,106 --> 01:36:37,295
[SPEAKER_05]: That is also coming as Final Fantasy IV The After Years is also coming to iOS and Android.

1264
01:36:37,315 --> 01:36:39,139
[SPEAKER_05]: That was in one of those news stories somewhere.

1265
01:36:39,399 --> 01:36:41,945
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like Final Fantasy VI The After Years or...

1266
01:36:43,720 --> 01:36:48,523
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be really cool to see, like, a sequel to one of the older Final Fantasy games in that way.

1267
01:36:48,683 --> 01:36:54,868
[SPEAKER_05]: After Years wasn't terrible, but, you know, I think the PSP was probably the best version of that, which so many people never even saw it.

1268
01:36:55,328 --> 01:36:56,008
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1269
01:36:56,949 --> 01:36:57,229
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1270
01:36:58,270 --> 01:36:59,010
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's move on.

1271
01:36:59,431 --> 01:37:00,712
[SPEAKER_05]: Are we to the Classic Game of the Week?

1272
01:37:00,772 --> 01:37:01,372
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we are.

1273
01:37:01,492 --> 01:37:02,113
[SPEAKER_05]: It's that time.

1274
01:37:02,293 --> 01:37:03,293
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, shit.

1275
01:37:04,274 --> 01:37:06,415
[SPEAKER_05]: We've just been talking about some classics, like...

1276
01:37:07,296 --> 01:37:32,730
[SPEAKER_05]: Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy 6 and so forth so DarkSakura's gonna dive into the gaming vault and I think it's a non-RPG she picked this week this one may as well be for Bobby like you were telling me offline earlier yeah I actually asked DarkSakura I was like were you picking this to troll certain chatters of ours and she's like no and I'm like but you do realize dot dot dot she's like oh yeah it's like oh oh alright well enough teasing what is the classic game of the week this week

1277
01:37:33,527 --> 01:37:35,849
[SPEAKER_01]: The classic game of the week is Marathon.

1278
01:37:37,250 --> 01:37:42,694
[SPEAKER_01]: Marathon was a first-person shooter done by Bungie, and it came out in 1994 for the Macintosh.

1279
01:37:43,254 --> 01:37:46,817
[SPEAKER_01]: People who say that there's not games for the Mac, look, there's a game.

1280
01:37:47,478 --> 01:37:47,958
[SPEAKER_05]: One game.

1281
01:37:48,278 --> 01:37:49,259
[SPEAKER_05]: Congrats.

1282
01:37:49,279 --> 01:37:50,600
[SPEAKER_05]: You've got that and Crystal Quest.

1283
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:51,701
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, I know.

1284
01:37:54,445 --> 01:38:00,208
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, the game was Bungie's second FPS game.

1285
01:38:00,228 --> 01:38:01,568
[SPEAKER_01]: The first was Pathways into Darkness.

1286
01:38:02,809 --> 01:38:11,133
[SPEAKER_01]: And the game basically was sort of, I wouldn't say biting on Doom, but it was seen as the Mac counterpart to Doom.

1287
01:38:12,868 --> 01:38:18,313
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, and of course this game didn't get a PC version until 1995.

1288
01:38:18,973 --> 01:38:24,338
[SPEAKER_01]: Samarathon was very action-oriented, very similar to Doom in how it played.

1289
01:38:24,358 --> 01:38:26,079
[SPEAKER_01]: It had a multiplayer deathmatch mode.

1290
01:38:26,519 --> 01:38:31,023
[SPEAKER_01]: You could have up to eight players on separate machines on the same LAN.

1291
01:38:32,104 --> 01:38:36,427
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was basically like, we love you Mac players, here you go.

1292
01:38:37,669 --> 01:38:38,850
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course it also had sequels.

1293
01:38:38,910 --> 01:38:41,012
[SPEAKER_01]: It had Marathon 2 and Marathon Infinity.

1294
01:38:42,734 --> 01:38:51,023
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in 1996 Bungie completed Super Marathon which was Marathon and Marathon 2 that was on the Bondi Pippin.

1295
01:38:52,404 --> 01:38:59,447
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I'm not going to go into too much about the game itself because the story on it is really freaking in-depth.

1296
01:38:59,567 --> 01:39:03,669
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we're talking a super, super rich plot.

1297
01:39:04,810 --> 01:39:10,833
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, story twists and a lot of things that I think that sort of become a future nod to...

1298
01:39:11,752 --> 01:39:12,092
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura.com

1299
01:39:28,741 --> 01:39:35,726
[SPEAKER_01]: The important thing that I think about this one is the fact that, number one, yeah, it was on the Mac.

1300
01:39:36,146 --> 01:39:52,277
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you had very few games, I think, because this was right when the transition, it used to be that, you know, a lot of your, you know, you had Lode Runner and all of your old Apple IIe games, and you had, like, the early Mac games, like all your Carmen Sandiego stuff and different ones.

1301
01:39:52,737 --> 01:39:57,279
[SPEAKER_01]: You didn't have like dedicated adult, I'd say adult themed games.

1302
01:39:57,439 --> 01:40:02,421
[SPEAKER_01]: And this one I thought was supposed to be pretty, it was pretty big news at the time.

1303
01:40:03,642 --> 01:40:06,603
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is in a semi-3D rendered world.

1304
01:40:08,524 --> 01:40:11,806
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all, you know, texture mapped and dynamic lit and everything.

1305
01:40:12,906 --> 01:40:20,289
[SPEAKER_01]: It has an option called a free look where you can actually look around the character and you can use your mouse to switch weapons and

1306
01:40:21,890 --> 01:40:25,212
[SPEAKER_01]: It meant you could look down, you could move around, you could look around corners.

1307
01:40:27,214 --> 01:40:31,337
[SPEAKER_01]: And the big thing, it was level oriented.

1308
01:40:31,677 --> 01:40:35,739
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kill enemies, avoid obstacles, the usual type of FPS stuff.

1309
01:40:36,680 --> 01:40:42,944
[SPEAKER_01]: And then to advance to your next level, you had to find a terminal that your AI could teleport you from.

1310
01:40:44,205 --> 01:40:50,130
[SPEAKER_01]: So, it had different objectives that you had to participate in in the game, including your puzzles.

1311
01:40:51,251 --> 01:40:55,375
[SPEAKER_01]: One level didn't have oxygen in it, so you had to complete it before asphyxiating.

1312
01:40:56,776 --> 01:40:59,558
[SPEAKER_01]: And you had motion sensors that you'd have to use.

1313
01:40:59,618 --> 01:41:00,139
[SPEAKER_01]: Different weapons.

1314
01:41:00,299 --> 01:41:11,208
[SPEAKER_01]: Your weapons were, you had your fists, a pistol, assault rifle, rocket launcher, a flamethrower that wouldn't kill everything, a fusion gun, and then you had this weird alien weapon.

1315
01:41:11,787 --> 01:41:16,009
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's another thing that came up in Halo, you know, where you could pick up the aliens' weapons.

1316
01:41:19,631 --> 01:41:26,054
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, also you have a multiplayer version where it was a deathmatch, where you had up to eight people on a land game.

1317
01:41:27,706 --> 01:41:31,588
[SPEAKER_01]: and does basically go around beat each other up until one's left.

1318
01:41:32,728 --> 01:41:44,073
[SPEAKER_01]: Macworld gave this game the Game Hall of Fame award for Best Network Game of 1995 and Bungie wanted to add more scenarios to it but did not.

1319
01:41:44,273 --> 01:41:48,775
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like they were trying to incorporate them into Marathon 2.

1320
01:41:50,383 --> 01:41:55,688
[SPEAKER_01]: Marathon is basically the big Mac enthusiast game.

1321
01:41:55,828 --> 01:42:01,132
[SPEAKER_01]: It started, I think, the realm of serious gaming on Mac.

1322
01:42:01,993 --> 01:42:09,860
[SPEAKER_01]: For everyone who says, yeah, Macs don't have games, this was, I think, the first attempt to really reach out to that market.

1323
01:42:12,895 --> 01:42:18,900
[SPEAKER_01]: It ended up being so popular that they did end up putting it out on PC later on with a trilogy set.

1324
01:42:20,020 --> 01:42:23,443
[SPEAKER_01]: And they even were supporting the Pippin, like I said earlier.

1325
01:42:26,185 --> 01:42:31,269
[SPEAKER_05]: That YouTube ran out, so I'm going to switch to this from the Xbox 360 remake music here real quick.

1326
01:42:31,289 --> 01:42:32,730
[SPEAKER_05]: This is from Durandal.

1327
01:42:34,778 --> 01:42:45,962
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, at any rate, there were concepts of the AI working that were taken from Marathon that were, as I said, later incorporated into the Halo series.

1328
01:42:46,702 --> 01:42:54,285
[SPEAKER_01]: And now there's also a version that came out in 2011 that is a port of Marathon for the iPad that was released for free.

1329
01:42:55,808 --> 01:42:58,730
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you want this and you have an iPad, you can definitely go play it.

1330
01:42:59,451 --> 01:43:03,273
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also, you can get the Aleph One engine.

1331
01:43:04,254 --> 01:43:06,435
[SPEAKER_01]: It's at the Marathon Open Source Project.

1332
01:43:07,516 --> 01:43:15,882
[SPEAKER_01]: And there is a site called The Trilogy Release that has downloadable copies of Marathon and the M1A1.

1333
01:43:17,123 --> 01:43:18,324
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can go play it.

1334
01:43:19,765 --> 01:43:20,065
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1335
01:43:21,246 --> 01:43:21,886
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it then?

1336
01:43:21,926 --> 01:43:22,947
[SPEAKER_05]: Your classic game of the week?

1337
01:43:23,407 --> 01:43:23,667
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.

1338
01:43:23,827 --> 01:43:26,889
[SPEAKER_05]: Or as Bobby keeps yelling in chat, Halo Zero.

1339
01:43:27,529 --> 01:43:29,210
[SPEAKER_05]: Which I suppose is one way of looking at it.

1340
01:43:29,330 --> 01:43:29,930
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, in a way.

1341
01:43:30,171 --> 01:43:31,611
[SPEAKER_05]: Without this, you wouldn't have Halo.

1342
01:43:32,412 --> 01:43:34,193
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a lot of the inspiration for Halo came from this.

1343
01:43:34,473 --> 01:43:37,074
[SPEAKER_01]: So, Bobby, it's not necessarily a troll on my part.

1344
01:43:37,814 --> 01:43:38,235
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a...

1345
01:43:40,939 --> 01:43:41,999
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for watching!

1346
01:43:59,765 --> 01:44:00,486
[SPEAKER_01]: Dark Castle Dark Castle

1347
01:44:24,386 --> 01:44:26,707
[SPEAKER_05]: was a great Macintosh game back in the day.

1348
01:44:26,767 --> 01:44:29,168
[SPEAKER_05]: If you've never checked that out, just saying.

1349
01:44:29,528 --> 01:44:35,190
[SPEAKER_05]: I know what you're talking about is you're talking about a different era of Macintosh, sort of, but just kind of saying.

1350
01:44:35,210 --> 01:44:38,912
[SPEAKER_01]: This was right about when PC really, really was picking up.

1351
01:44:39,632 --> 01:44:43,734
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, when the Windows format, because I think this was right around the Windows 95 era.

1352
01:44:44,634 --> 01:44:50,536
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're looking at the big jump from Mac to PC as far as...

1353
01:44:53,502 --> 01:44:54,883
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd say the everyday user.

1354
01:44:56,644 --> 01:45:01,407
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, Bobby Blackwolf in our chatroom says, I approve of this classic game of the week, Hearts, and he is eating his peas.

1355
01:45:01,687 --> 01:45:02,527
[SPEAKER_01]: Good, good boy.

1356
01:45:04,208 --> 01:45:05,589
[SPEAKER_01]: You can have a fudge pop when you're done.

1357
01:45:06,189 --> 01:45:13,894
[SPEAKER_05]: DungeonBuster in chat says that, reminds us you can play the Marathon Trilogy on PCs for free thanks to Bungie.

1358
01:45:13,934 --> 01:45:18,037
[SPEAKER_05]: It's at source.bungie.org So no excuse for you to not check out this game of the week.

1359
01:45:18,497 --> 01:45:20,338
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to see if it's actually still free on iPad.

1360
01:45:20,871 --> 01:45:21,071
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.

1361
01:45:21,952 --> 01:45:22,212
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1362
01:45:22,632 --> 01:45:23,092
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

1363
01:45:23,192 --> 01:45:23,432
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1364
01:45:23,472 --> 01:45:27,274
[SPEAKER_05]: We are definitely running long for this first half of the show, so let's take a break, guys.

1365
01:45:27,554 --> 01:45:37,359
[SPEAKER_05]: When we come back, we will have more Orange Launch Radio, Rapid Fire News, Fugle Question of the Week, your emails, phone calls, and plenty more when we come back with more of Orange Launch Radio right after this.

1366
01:45:44,068 --> 01:45:55,312
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio episode number 523 already in progress here on October the 13th of 2013.

1367
01:45:55,412 --> 01:45:57,373
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow, Halloween is sneaking up on us fast.

1368
01:45:57,493 --> 01:45:59,173
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if you guys have any plans.

1369
01:45:59,914 --> 01:46:04,615
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, is Josh at about that age where you actually do stuff for Halloween or he's still got another year or two?

1370
01:46:04,635 --> 01:46:05,375
[SPEAKER_05]: He goes trick-or-treating.

1371
01:46:05,535 --> 01:46:05,776
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah?

1372
01:46:05,996 --> 01:46:07,096
[SPEAKER_05]: Usually just around the block.

1373
01:46:07,396 --> 01:46:09,657
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a lot of candy you can get for yourself to eat, huh?

1374
01:46:10,457 --> 01:46:11,358
[SPEAKER_02]: New Kirk or Old Kirk?

1375
01:46:11,378 --> 01:46:11,718
[SPEAKER_02]: New Kirk.

1376
01:46:11,758 --> 01:46:12,919
[SPEAKER_02]: He's going to be a little heartbreaker.

1377
01:46:40,208 --> 01:46:41,229
[SPEAKER_05]: That is so funny.

1378
01:46:41,329 --> 01:46:42,269
[SPEAKER_05]: That's going to be adorable.

1379
01:46:42,330 --> 01:46:43,410
[SPEAKER_05]: Julian's what, six, seven?

1380
01:46:43,690 --> 01:46:44,811
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, last year he was Iron Man.

1381
01:46:45,612 --> 01:46:46,292
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he's six.

1382
01:46:46,933 --> 01:46:47,433
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my gosh.

1383
01:46:47,953 --> 01:46:48,254
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1384
01:46:49,534 --> 01:46:57,040
[SPEAKER_05]: One of my friends is, I don't know how much about this I should say on air, but one of my friends is having a party and the whole theme about it is internet memes.

1385
01:46:57,560 --> 01:47:00,282
[SPEAKER_05]: So I have to figure out which one I'm going to do.

1386
01:47:00,542 --> 01:47:05,705
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm pretty sure I know, but I don't want to say on air because I know this person listens to the show and I want them to be surprised.

1387
01:47:05,765 --> 01:47:09,048
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, I'm so looking forward to seeing the costumes that come out of this.

1388
01:47:09,068 --> 01:47:09,408
[SPEAKER_05]: That'd be fun.

1389
01:47:09,448 --> 01:47:10,489
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1390
01:47:30,709 --> 01:47:32,190
[SPEAKER_05]: because I forgot for Mighty No.

1391
01:47:32,210 --> 01:47:32,190
9.

1392
01:47:32,370 --> 01:47:34,411
[SPEAKER_05]: I never ended up contributing to that.

1393
01:47:34,852 --> 01:47:38,334
[SPEAKER_05]: And I forgot for something else, too, I was going to contribute to recently.

1394
01:47:38,454 --> 01:47:41,716
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was the – well, I think it's coming up in Rapid Fire News.

1395
01:47:42,717 --> 01:47:43,617
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me peek real quick.

1396
01:47:43,657 --> 01:47:44,318
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah, it is coming up.

1397
01:47:44,338 --> 01:47:45,038
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll tell you in a minute here.

1398
01:47:45,939 --> 01:47:46,239
[SPEAKER_05]: But, yeah.

1399
01:47:46,259 --> 01:47:48,080
[SPEAKER_05]: He's raw.

1400
01:47:48,200 --> 01:47:49,501
[SPEAKER_01]: Way to tease everybody.

1401
01:47:49,541 --> 01:47:52,282
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanted to remember, so I did the donation during the break here.

1402
01:47:53,483 --> 01:47:55,565
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope it gets funded so I can get some magazines.

1403
01:47:56,745 --> 01:48:00,646
[SPEAKER_01]: I want him to hire me.

1404
01:48:01,747 --> 01:48:02,427
[SPEAKER_05]: You should write a letter.

1405
01:48:02,647 --> 01:48:03,107
[SPEAKER_05]: You never know.

1406
01:48:05,028 --> 01:48:07,049
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw another podcaster on the list.

1407
01:48:07,109 --> 01:48:08,509
[SPEAKER_01]: And Actdeft, you know what?

1408
01:48:09,049 --> 01:48:11,410
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think Rob could be Courage Wolf.

1409
01:48:12,591 --> 01:48:13,831
[SPEAKER_01]: Rob would make a good Moon Moon.

1410
01:48:14,751 --> 01:48:15,011
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

1411
01:48:16,292 --> 01:48:17,692
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what meme you're referencing there.

1412
01:48:17,932 --> 01:48:18,993
[SPEAKER_01]: You haven't seen Moon Moon?

1413
01:48:19,693 --> 01:48:21,254
[SPEAKER_01]: It's this derpy wolf picture.

1414
01:48:21,934 --> 01:48:22,214
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

1415
01:48:22,811 --> 01:48:24,192
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's pretty funny.

1416
01:48:24,492 --> 01:48:24,712
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, God.

1417
01:48:24,732 --> 01:48:25,632
[SPEAKER_01]: Just look up Moon Moon.

1418
01:48:25,832 --> 01:48:26,652
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, I will, I will.

1419
01:48:27,013 --> 01:48:27,313
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1420
01:48:27,733 --> 01:48:29,133
[SPEAKER_05]: Dress up like scumbag Steve.

1421
01:48:30,434 --> 01:48:35,235
[SPEAKER_05]: Funny you mentioned that, because I told Alan that's what he should be, and he really took offense to that.

1422
01:48:35,696 --> 01:48:39,757
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm like, but, like, you're tall and, like, you have to go T, like, you can do it.

1423
01:48:39,777 --> 01:48:50,661
[SPEAKER_02]: See, because I don't know half the names of them out there, but maybe, like, was it that guy that's high or whatever that comes to the, you know, the...

1424
01:48:51,301 --> 01:48:52,242
[SPEAKER_02]: and EpiphanyGuy.

1425
01:48:52,302 --> 01:48:54,024
[SPEAKER_02]: I forget what the... Keanu Reeves?

1426
01:48:54,604 --> 01:48:56,146
[SPEAKER_02]: No, not the Keanu Reeves guy.

1427
01:48:56,186 --> 01:49:00,049
[SPEAKER_02]: There's one that's like a guy at a concert or like a rave or something like that.

1428
01:49:00,389 --> 01:49:02,611
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's just kind of standing there like high looking.

1429
01:49:03,092 --> 01:49:04,093
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1430
01:49:04,193 --> 01:49:07,696
[SPEAKER_05]: You need to go to knowyourmem.com and find it on there.

1431
01:49:07,716 --> 01:49:08,737
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a whole website about it.

1432
01:49:08,957 --> 01:49:12,220
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the problem though is I don't know what it's called so it'd be kind of hard to look it up.

1433
01:49:13,221 --> 01:49:13,561
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.

1434
01:49:13,861 --> 01:49:14,322
[SPEAKER_02]: It's no big deal.

1435
01:49:14,742 --> 01:49:16,363
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's move on.

1436
01:49:16,644 --> 01:49:17,364
[SPEAKER_05]: Rapid Fire News.

1437
01:49:17,925 --> 01:49:19,826
[SPEAKER_05]: Talk about quickly what's going on in the gaming world.

1438
01:49:19,866 --> 01:49:20,146
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki.

1439
01:49:20,286 --> 01:49:26,371
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first piece of DLC for Saints Row 4 comes out on October 22nd in North America, October 23rd in the UK.

1440
01:49:30,294 --> 01:49:32,856
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's the Enter the Dominatrix DLC.

1441
01:49:32,876 --> 01:49:36,458
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember, Enter the Dominatrix was going to be what Saints Row 4 was.

1442
01:49:36,858 --> 01:49:41,581
[SPEAKER_02]: Originally, they were planning on doing this standalone expansion for Saints Row 3.

1443
01:49:41,861 --> 01:49:46,043
[SPEAKER_02]: It's basically an alternate storyline to what Saints Row 4 is.

1444
01:49:46,504 --> 01:49:52,067
[SPEAKER_02]: It includes an alternate Zin invasion storyline with the Saints trapped in a virtual world run by an alien.

1445
01:49:52,407 --> 01:49:54,369
[SPEAKER_02]: AI program known as the Dominatrix.

1446
01:49:55,170 --> 01:50:00,356
[SPEAKER_02]: And they have to survive, I guess, against a bunch of sex workers and gimps and stuff in the game.

1447
01:50:00,897 --> 01:50:05,642
[SPEAKER_05]: So... Only a game like Saints Row can you be describing like this.

1448
01:50:05,662 --> 01:50:11,128
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess it's gonna have new weapons, enemies, allies, and they said missions, and a behind-the-scenes commentary.

1449
01:50:12,287 --> 01:50:27,581
[SPEAKER_02]: Taking what I learned from Saints Row III and to all those that have Saints Row IV, I caution you, wait until the reviews come out before you decide to buy this DLC, especially if you decide to buy a season pass because a season pass is for two pieces of DLC.

1450
01:50:28,462 --> 01:50:47,673
[SPEAKER_02]: because if it's anything that stays for the third those pieces of DLC were 30 minutes long and they were crap you played them once there's like four missions and you're done with them and you're just like why the fuck did I just spend money on that so take the time to read the reviews on the DLC before you purchase it because that's what I'm gonna do because

1451
01:50:49,233 --> 01:50:53,656
[SPEAKER_02]: I've gotten screwed multiple times by Saints Row the Third, so just a fair warning.

1452
01:50:54,036 --> 01:50:57,178
[SPEAKER_02]: And yes, it will be, I think, $7 for the DLC.

1453
01:50:57,638 --> 01:50:58,539
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, $7.

1454
01:50:59,539 --> 01:51:02,341
[SPEAKER_02]: So, cool.

1455
01:51:02,781 --> 01:51:09,585
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to get an Xbox 360 and haven't done so yet, there are going to be some holiday bundles, and they are launching, I believe, today.

1456
01:51:10,546 --> 01:51:15,389
[SPEAKER_02]: And those holiday bundles are going to net you not only game systems, but two free games with each one.

1457
01:51:16,009 --> 01:51:17,530
[SPEAKER_02]: So, for example, they have a...

1458
01:51:19,931 --> 01:51:28,414
[SPEAKER_02]: for $299, a 250GB system with Halo 4 and Tomb Raider, a 4GB system with Kinect with Kinect Sports Season 2 and Kinect Adventures.

1459
01:51:28,474 --> 01:51:31,234
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's technically one free game because Kinect Adventures comes with Kinect.

1460
01:51:31,675 --> 01:51:32,115
[SPEAKER_02]: Just saying.

1461
01:51:32,795 --> 01:51:45,459
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, of course, also a $399 bundle for a 250GB system with Kinect and Forza Horizon as well as Kinect Sports Season 2 and...

1462
01:51:48,052 --> 01:51:58,939
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even know if that's season 2 looking at the picture now I think that might be the Kinect Sports season I think it's both season 1 and season 2

1463
01:52:02,731 --> 01:52:03,691
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me see here real quick.

1464
01:52:03,711 --> 01:52:04,892
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to get a better picture of this.

1465
01:52:05,292 --> 01:52:06,192
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a season two.

1466
01:52:06,813 --> 01:52:08,814
[SPEAKER_02]: At least that's what it says on Major Nelson's site.

1467
01:52:08,834 --> 01:52:10,934
[SPEAKER_02]: But it doesn't look like the boxer does not look right.

1468
01:52:11,915 --> 01:52:13,195
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he's full of shit.

1469
01:52:14,196 --> 01:52:14,656
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just me.

1470
01:52:14,776 --> 01:52:16,977
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, so yeah, that's going to be coming out.

1471
01:52:17,437 --> 01:52:19,378
[SPEAKER_02]: And so look forward to those.

1472
01:52:20,458 --> 01:52:23,039
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, I guess that is season two.

1473
01:52:23,240 --> 01:52:24,220
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that I look at the picture.

1474
01:52:26,156 --> 01:52:26,416
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.

1475
01:52:27,937 --> 01:52:33,420
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, Ubisoft has revealed the Assassin's Creed 4 Season Pass content.

1476
01:52:34,300 --> 01:52:37,101
[SPEAKER_02]: And unlike this time around, we don't get an evil Washington.

1477
01:52:38,242 --> 01:52:49,987
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead, we get Freedom Cry, a nine-mission single-player campaign starring a new protagonist, Edward Kenway's first mate, let's say, Aidwhale.

1478
01:52:51,028 --> 01:52:54,249
[SPEAKER_02]: And he is an escaped slave.

1479
01:52:55,830 --> 01:53:01,974
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's going to be coming, I guess, 1999 for the season pass.

1480
01:53:04,636 --> 01:53:04,896
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.

1481
01:53:06,237 --> 01:53:10,220
[SPEAKER_02]: And they have an exclusive Kraken ship pack.

1482
01:53:10,600 --> 01:53:11,961
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you get to yell, release the Kraken?

1483
01:53:12,001 --> 01:53:12,461
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, you do.

1484
01:53:12,481 --> 01:53:14,322
[SPEAKER_05]: You get to yell that.

1485
01:53:15,903 --> 01:53:16,804
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what it's all about.

1486
01:53:17,865 --> 01:53:22,347
[SPEAKER_05]: What about the whole fact that the Assassin's Creed DLC is not coming to Wii U?

1487
01:53:23,148 --> 01:53:23,428
[SPEAKER_05]: The only thing...

1488
01:53:43,047 --> 01:53:48,631
[SPEAKER_02]: The only thing I can think of is that there must be some sort of funky infrastructure that they have to put in there.

1489
01:53:48,691 --> 01:53:50,312
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe they have to tweak some stuff.

1490
01:53:50,352 --> 01:53:52,994
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, this is the tinfoil hat guy in me.

1491
01:53:53,234 --> 01:54:06,282
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, judge me all you want, but I am convinced that there is something in Nintendo's online infrastructure that is not conducive to the DLC thing like Sony and Microsoft.

1492
01:54:06,322 --> 01:54:07,063
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what it is.

1493
01:54:07,083 --> 01:54:09,144
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it's the cut that they take or something.

1494
01:54:09,164 --> 01:54:10,645
[SPEAKER_02]: Or maybe it's like, you know...

1495
01:54:12,366 --> 01:54:32,877
[SPEAKER_02]: well I would think even if the cut wasn't that good I still think it would want to do that maybe it's some sort of exclusive I don't know I don't know what it is but yeah I know a lot of games come out for the Wii U and they don't have DLC packed in there I don't think it's the cut or anything or it wouldn't be so appealing to indie developers though like I almost wonder if it's something about the process but indie developers don't do DLC for their games usually true true

1496
01:54:33,577 --> 01:54:37,259
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, anyhow, so the tinfoil speculation continues all around the internet.

1497
01:54:37,659 --> 01:54:43,342
[SPEAKER_05]: Meanwhile, a game that's coming out for the Xbox One that some people are looking forward to, Killer Instinct.

1498
01:54:43,702 --> 01:54:46,764
[SPEAKER_05]: Killer Instinct will be doing their balance updates on the fly.

1499
01:54:47,184 --> 01:54:50,246
[SPEAKER_05]: In other words, they're talking about doing the cloud.

1500
01:54:50,266 --> 01:54:52,487
[SPEAKER_05]: They're talking about they're updating immediately through the cloud.

1501
01:54:52,607 --> 01:54:56,689
[SPEAKER_05]: And all the variables that talk about how a character behaves are going to exist in the cloud.

1502
01:54:56,709 --> 01:54:59,851
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is according to producer Torin Rettig, talking to Game Informer.

1503
01:55:00,711 --> 01:55:02,211
[SPEAKER_05]: So what I'm hearing is that it is patching.

1504
01:55:26,198 --> 01:55:28,579
[SPEAKER_05]: They're just really small files.

1505
01:55:28,619 --> 01:55:32,139
[SPEAKER_05]: They're patches, but they're not like PlayStation patches that take an hour.

1506
01:55:33,040 --> 01:55:34,860
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fine if they're doing that.

1507
01:55:34,920 --> 01:55:38,941
[SPEAKER_02]: They did that even with some Xbox games got around that where they could tweak stuff.

1508
01:55:39,161 --> 01:55:47,383
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember one of the games we actually talked to people or talked to a developer at E3 about was that Madballs Babbo Invasion game.

1509
01:55:47,403 --> 01:55:49,523
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember that?

1510
01:55:49,843 --> 01:55:52,164
[SPEAKER_02]: They were talking about how they could tweak everything via...

1511
01:55:53,565 --> 01:56:18,965
[SPEAKER_05]: just basically having the game be online they can tweak all the variables I get the idea about tweaking things like in the cloud so to speak like a lot of MMOs do this all the time we call them hot fixes and World of Warcraft and so forth but when I hear like well it's tweaked in the cloud but then there actually are small patches but it's done in the cloud I'm like you use that word cloud and I don't think it means what you think it means you know what it means I don't think it means what you think it means anyway just

1512
01:56:19,005 --> 01:56:19,626
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

1513
01:56:37,720 --> 01:56:42,623
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, here's the other Kickstarter I teased earlier that I forgot to back and the deadline has passed.

1514
01:56:42,723 --> 01:56:44,684
[SPEAKER_05]: It's River City Ransom Underground.

1515
01:56:45,044 --> 01:56:48,525
[SPEAKER_05]: River City Ransom Underground did make its funding this week.

1516
01:56:49,166 --> 01:56:55,689
[SPEAKER_05]: They raised $180,000 Canadian dollars and that will ensure that they will be able to get the game onto the PC.

1517
01:56:56,850 --> 01:56:57,910
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, there it goes.

1518
01:56:58,490 --> 01:56:59,851
[SPEAKER_05]: So congratulations to them.

1519
01:56:59,911 --> 01:57:01,252
[SPEAKER_05]: Look forward to being able to play the game.

1520
01:57:02,292 --> 01:57:06,114
[SPEAKER_05]: And lastly, here's a game I am very excited about on the 3DS.

1521
01:57:06,314 --> 01:57:08,355
[SPEAKER_05]: I am more excited about this game than Pokemon.

1522
01:57:08,455 --> 01:57:17,618
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry about it, but this is far more important than Pokemon X and Y. I don't care if you're going to judge me for that, because this is Zelda A Link Between Worlds.

1523
01:57:17,818 --> 01:57:19,059
[SPEAKER_05]: I am very excited about this.

1524
01:57:19,379 --> 01:57:31,324
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a new trailer shown this week that actually shows that some of the ways that you have that link between worlds, because obviously in the teaser logo you have the light Triforce and the dark Triforce.

1525
01:57:31,624 --> 01:57:34,847
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, in this new teaser, you see Link literally slipping through cracks.

1526
01:57:35,107 --> 01:57:39,630
[SPEAKER_05]: Because, you know, it's that whole thing where he can kind of press himself up against a wall like paper.

1527
01:57:39,950 --> 01:57:44,954
[SPEAKER_05]: And he goes from Hyrule to Lorule is the name of the other world, it seems like.

1528
01:57:45,114 --> 01:57:45,515
[SPEAKER_05]: Get it?

1529
01:57:45,775 --> 01:57:46,175
[SPEAKER_05]: High?

1530
01:57:46,475 --> 01:57:46,796
[SPEAKER_05]: Low?

1531
01:57:47,476 --> 01:57:48,257
[SPEAKER_05]: Ah, her.

1532
01:57:48,557 --> 01:57:49,458
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, whatever.

1533
01:57:50,079 --> 01:57:52,861
[SPEAKER_05]: As long as the game's good, I don't care what they call the world.

1534
01:57:53,782 --> 01:57:54,363
[SPEAKER_05]: So there it is.

1535
01:57:54,783 --> 01:57:57,125
[SPEAKER_05]: And I guess there is a new villain in the game, too.

1536
01:57:57,225 --> 01:57:59,868
[SPEAKER_05]: But I kind of go, sure, there's a new villain.

1537
01:58:00,148 --> 01:58:01,169
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure, it's a new villain.

1538
01:58:01,249 --> 01:58:02,450
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll fucking be Ganon.

1539
01:58:04,051 --> 01:58:04,352
[SPEAKER_05]: Somehow.

1540
01:58:04,392 --> 01:58:06,193
[SPEAKER_05]: Or something controlled by Ganon or whatever.

1541
01:58:06,694 --> 01:58:09,416
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyhow, the release date of the game, November 22nd.

1542
01:58:10,632 --> 01:58:11,152
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1543
01:58:37,009 --> 01:58:37,850
[SPEAKER_01]: Stryder, yo

1544
01:58:59,271 --> 01:59:08,482
[SPEAKER_01]: and some other indie developers and let them check out some of the Kickstarter games like Broken Age and another untitled game.

1545
01:59:09,803 --> 01:59:12,826
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's basically just hang out with us, play some games.

1546
01:59:13,187 --> 01:59:13,828
[SPEAKER_01]: We're cool people.

1547
01:59:14,248 --> 01:59:14,809
[SPEAKER_01]: You like us.

1548
01:59:15,449 --> 01:59:16,510
[SPEAKER_01]: So hurry for Double Vine.

1549
01:59:17,791 --> 01:59:23,273
[SPEAKER_01]: and then Ed Boon who developed Injustice and he was our Mortal Kombat dude.

1550
01:59:24,294 --> 01:59:33,878
[SPEAKER_01]: He basically said on Twitter that he wanted to create a Mortal Kombat vs. Street Fighter and that he's reached out to Capcom to see if they would be interested but they have not replied yet.

1551
01:59:34,638 --> 01:59:36,599
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know that that would be something that...

1552
01:59:37,739 --> 02:00:04,724
[SPEAKER_02]: Capcom would go for do it because I mean if they do it they're the same route as they did like with Injustice well not Injustice but like Mortal Kombat versus DC where it's kind of pussified where they just you know make it teen rated and not so violent then they could probably get away with it because I think the whole thing was well we don't want to have you know these guys doing fatalities on you know Street Fighter characters or even I think DC does the same thing we don't want we don't want Scorpion ripping the head off of Superman because that's just not realistic

1553
02:00:07,282 --> 02:00:11,645
[SPEAKER_01]: I still thought it was funny that they put in the original Joker fatality later on.

1554
02:00:11,785 --> 02:00:12,325
[SPEAKER_01]: The full thing.

1555
02:00:12,925 --> 02:00:14,787
[SPEAKER_01]: That was pretty cool.

1556
02:00:15,247 --> 02:00:24,072
[SPEAKER_01]: And then something that a lot of people are excited for is that the Final Fantasy X and X-2 HD remasters are going to be out in Japan in December.

1557
02:00:24,712 --> 02:00:31,637
[SPEAKER_01]: They will be out for Vita and PS3 and the date for release is December 26th.

1558
02:00:32,497 --> 02:00:35,539
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm hoping that we're going to get it soon after over here in the U.S.,

1559
02:00:37,236 --> 02:00:38,537
[SPEAKER_01]: Yay!

1560
02:00:38,857 --> 02:00:39,837
[SPEAKER_01]: There was much rejoicing.

1561
02:00:39,957 --> 02:00:43,979
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the only upcoming game that I had tentative for this year that I still don't know what the date is.

1562
02:00:44,799 --> 02:00:45,720
[SPEAKER_02]: I keep asking, too.

1563
02:00:47,441 --> 02:00:57,625
[SPEAKER_01]: I would assume it'd have to be... Assuming they're localizing it around the same time as the current development, then I would assume sometime in January, February.

1564
02:01:00,530 --> 02:01:02,751
[SPEAKER_05]: Alrighty.

1565
02:01:03,151 --> 02:01:07,632
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm really looking forward to those games, but I'm okay if it takes until after the holidays to finish it.

1566
02:01:07,752 --> 02:01:09,193
[SPEAKER_05]: I still didn't even play through Kingdom Hearts.

1567
02:01:09,553 --> 02:01:12,033
[SPEAKER_05]: Final Fantasy XIV derailed all my gaming stuff.

1568
02:01:12,694 --> 02:01:14,694
[SPEAKER_05]: I gotta get back on board with the other stuff.

1569
02:01:14,734 --> 02:01:16,895
[SPEAKER_01]: Rob, you still have to play XIV with me.

1570
02:01:17,865 --> 02:01:19,047
[SPEAKER_05]: Make me... No, I'm just kidding.

1571
02:01:20,008 --> 02:01:24,014
[SPEAKER_05]: Alan can run dungeons now too, so I'm trying to get him up to speed and then maybe we can all do stuff.

1572
02:01:24,034 --> 02:01:25,256
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll make you a sandwich if you play.

1573
02:01:25,416 --> 02:01:26,297
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool, I love sandwiches.

1574
02:01:26,317 --> 02:01:26,858
[SPEAKER_01]: But not right now.

1575
02:01:27,278 --> 02:01:30,102
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's get to the Fugle Question of the Week, you guys.

1576
02:01:38,436 --> 02:01:41,718
[SPEAKER_05]: Every week we ask a question of our Facebook and our Google Plus communities.

1577
02:01:41,758 --> 02:01:44,480
[SPEAKER_05]: You take those words and throw them together and you get Foogle.

1578
02:01:44,980 --> 02:01:47,502
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's time for the Foogle question of the week.

1579
02:01:47,802 --> 02:01:52,485
[SPEAKER_05]: And that question is, knowing the interview we had earlier tonight, we kind of stuck with the theme here.

1580
02:01:53,065 --> 02:01:57,888
[SPEAKER_05]: The question is, do you currently or have you in the past subscribed to any video game magazines?

1581
02:01:58,028 --> 02:01:58,569
[SPEAKER_05]: Which ones?

1582
02:01:58,909 --> 02:02:00,590
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you have a particularly favorite issue?

1583
02:02:01,290 --> 02:02:03,871
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, yeah, so we got a lot of responses to this.

1584
02:02:04,111 --> 02:02:06,492
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have time to read all these answers, I'm very sorry.

1585
02:02:06,812 --> 02:02:13,714
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm going to really encourage you to go to our Facebook community at facebook.com slash orange launch radio and our Google Plus community to check out the answers.

1586
02:02:13,754 --> 02:02:22,237
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to try to read some of these, and I'm going to try to pick names I don't see very often, just to cycle through some different voices I don't always see in chat or other places.

1587
02:02:22,977 --> 02:02:25,278
[SPEAKER_05]: So starting with Gaming Nerd on Facebook says...

1588
02:02:25,698 --> 02:02:26,058
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

1589
02:02:26,078 --> 02:02:26,278
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

1590
02:02:44,651 --> 02:02:52,937
[SPEAKER_05]: Unfolded Raptor says, I subscribed to Nintendo Power and Electronic Gaming Monthly and have kept every issue, but the story behind my favorite issue is interesting.

1591
02:02:53,617 --> 02:03:02,723
[SPEAKER_05]: In October 2004, issue 183 of EGM, they interviewed a girl by the name of Rachel Moore who was talking about horror games and wearing a Tony Hawk's Underground shirt.

1592
02:03:03,143 --> 02:03:07,967
[SPEAKER_05]: About 2006, I discovered Orange Lounge Radio randomly and started listening to you on my PSP.

1593
02:03:08,467 --> 02:03:14,251
[SPEAKER_05]: This got my interest started in gaming podcasts and eventually I wound up on AllGames.com, which is where we were previously.

1594
02:03:15,051 --> 02:03:17,192
[SPEAKER_05]: and listen to both OLR and All Games Interactive.

1595
02:03:17,492 --> 02:03:21,153
[SPEAKER_05]: Then move to Dead Pixel and Spooky Hour Horror Hour where Rachel Moore was a host.

1596
02:03:21,533 --> 02:03:32,595
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't think much of it at the time and I didn't put it all together until I was looking back at my old gaming magazines and had a holy shit moment because this girl I was listening to was way bigger than I thought and I knew her before even if I didn't realize it.

1597
02:03:32,915 --> 02:03:34,176
[SPEAKER_05]: Now it's kept in a safe place.

1598
02:03:34,616 --> 02:03:37,837
[SPEAKER_05]: Then imagine my shock when I heard OLR was moving to AllGames.com.

1599
02:03:37,877 --> 02:03:38,457
[SPEAKER_05]: It was amazing.

1600
02:03:38,477 --> 02:03:39,177
[SPEAKER_05]: And now we have VOG.

1601
02:03:39,597 --> 02:03:39,977
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

1602
02:03:55,804 --> 02:04:11,520
[SPEAKER_05]: Elliot B says I had a subscription to Edge Magazine for over a decade now and it's still very much worth reading always has interesting features and stunning design especially the gorgeous glossy covers though I sometimes miss the days when it was pretentious enough to refer to itself in third person

1603
02:04:12,749 --> 02:04:14,330
[SPEAKER_05]: Amanda R replies and says,

1604
02:04:29,241 --> 02:04:30,641
[SPEAKER_05]: Game Informer and Nintendo Power

1605
02:04:52,526 --> 02:04:58,890
[SPEAKER_05]: My favorite issue would have to be Nintendo Power 172 because they featured some envelope art that I submitted.

1606
02:04:59,170 --> 02:05:01,251
[SPEAKER_05]: It was the happiest moment of my young life.

1607
02:05:02,652 --> 02:05:11,918
[SPEAKER_05]: And lastly, we'll read an answer here from Veronica S, who says, I used to subscribe to Nintendo Power back in the GameCube days, but I got tired of reading it, so I unsubscribed.

1608
02:05:12,418 --> 02:05:18,602
[SPEAKER_05]: Now I subscribe to Nintendo Force, the all-new spiritual successor to Nintendo Power.

1609
02:05:19,162 --> 02:05:20,204
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you guys for the answers.

1610
02:05:35,106 --> 02:05:40,148
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of love for Nintendo Power across the board, I noticed, which doesn't surprise me one bit.

1611
02:05:40,448 --> 02:05:42,189
[SPEAKER_05]: That's certainly one that's near and dear to my heart.

1612
02:05:42,469 --> 02:05:46,471
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I got in trouble when I was in fourth grade over an issue of Nintendo Power.

1613
02:05:46,751 --> 02:05:47,011
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

1614
02:05:47,151 --> 02:05:48,832
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, because I had it out in class and I was showing friends.

1615
02:05:48,872 --> 02:05:53,014
[SPEAKER_05]: It was the controversial issue with Simon's Quest on the cover.

1616
02:05:53,034 --> 02:06:01,698
[SPEAKER_05]: It was only like issue four or something, but parents were very upset that there was skulls and imagery on the cover of a magazine like this.

1617
02:06:02,578 --> 02:06:05,741
[SPEAKER_02]: I had one of the big guides for Mario Paint.

1618
02:06:06,421 --> 02:06:07,442
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, I remember that one.

1619
02:06:07,502 --> 02:06:09,484
[SPEAKER_05]: It had the songs in it you could put in the game.

1620
02:06:09,504 --> 02:06:15,969
[SPEAKER_02]: The songs, it had a bunch of bitmap stuff for all the different characters.

1621
02:06:16,049 --> 02:06:17,570
[SPEAKER_02]: It was pretty cool.

1622
02:06:17,891 --> 02:06:27,959
[SPEAKER_01]: For the record, there was a magazine that I was super into that had a short run, but it was gorgeous in its production value and their designers were freaking brilliant.

1623
02:06:28,539 --> 02:06:28,980
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you remember Play?

1624
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:29,240
[SPEAKER_01]: Play?

1625
02:06:30,605 --> 02:06:33,206
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I still see that magazine in places.

1626
02:06:33,246 --> 02:06:34,386
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I know that magazine.

1627
02:06:34,426 --> 02:06:35,766
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if it's still in print.

1628
02:06:35,806 --> 02:06:38,226
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, not like new, but like collectors, things.

1629
02:06:38,326 --> 02:06:41,807
[SPEAKER_01]: But they had gorgeous spreads.

1630
02:06:42,007 --> 02:06:45,188
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the design in that magazine was so top-notch.

1631
02:06:45,208 --> 02:06:51,769
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really one of... I've actually used examples from that magazine in some of my own layouts.

1632
02:06:52,729 --> 02:06:57,590
[SPEAKER_01]: Borrowed ideas from it because it was such a... And it was very well-written on top of that.

1633
02:06:57,950 --> 02:06:58,150
[SPEAKER_05]: Mm-hmm.

1634
02:06:59,201 --> 02:07:01,441
[SPEAKER_05]: Alrighty, well let's move on with some more news stories.

1635
02:07:01,501 --> 02:07:01,762
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki.

1636
02:07:02,622 --> 02:07:02,882
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

1637
02:07:04,042 --> 02:07:10,843
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's talk a little bit about a follow-up kind of what we talked about last week with the whole Neo Geo X plug-and-play thing.

1638
02:07:11,704 --> 02:07:27,547
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember we were talking that they were basically ending their contract with Tomo and Tomo wouldn't be able to create these Neo Geo X portable systems and the dock and stuff that actually looks like the Neo Geo system and the controller and all that.

1639
02:07:28,067 --> 02:07:34,370
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Tomo denies that there was any sort of breach of contract at all, and actually, they're just going to continue selling the Neo Geo X anyways.

1640
02:07:35,070 --> 02:07:46,675
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently, there's been some comments, I guess, from people that had other agreements with SNK previously, saying that they've retracted, I guess...

1641
02:07:48,856 --> 02:08:17,585
[SPEAKER_02]: they've tried to pull this kind of thing with other companies with licensing but it says they recently extended their licensing agreement through 2016 and that they're going to basically keep publishing that stuff or making those things until their contract runs up despite what SNK is saying because I guess there would be a breach of contract this is kind of interesting and so they're saying that you know

1642
02:08:19,221 --> 02:08:24,263
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, they're still taking care of, I guess, all the warranties of those systems.

1643
02:08:24,283 --> 02:08:31,466
[SPEAKER_02]: It says, we're continuing to sell Neo Geo X products, including Neo Geo X Gold System, Arcade Stick, Mega Pack, Classic Volumes 1 through 5.

1644
02:08:31,626 --> 02:08:37,188
[SPEAKER_02]: It says, a license agreement which allows Tomo to sell and market these products remains in effect.

1645
02:08:38,588 --> 02:08:40,209
[SPEAKER_02]: So, that's kind of interesting.

1646
02:08:41,429 --> 02:08:44,370
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but I like that they're not going out without a fight.

1647
02:08:44,590 --> 02:08:45,390
[SPEAKER_05]: This is pretty cool.

1648
02:08:45,430 --> 02:08:51,452
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, if they've got a contract that they signed and then all of a sudden, you know, SNK is saying, well, no, we don't want to do that anymore.

1649
02:08:52,132 --> 02:09:00,475
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless they have, like, a legal out in that contract, I don't see how they can just say, no, we're not going to follow through with that contract.

1650
02:09:00,495 --> 02:09:01,295
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, right.

1651
02:09:03,956 --> 02:09:04,516
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, come on.

1652
02:09:04,576 --> 02:09:06,937
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know why they would do that in the first place.

1653
02:09:07,577 --> 02:09:09,658
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't want the new GOB out there?

1654
02:09:09,738 --> 02:09:11,118
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what their plan is.

1655
02:09:12,999 --> 02:09:13,419
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1656
02:09:13,719 --> 02:09:14,980
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess we'll see how this plays out.

1657
02:09:15,100 --> 02:09:18,361
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and maybe your chance isn't up to get one of these systems after all.

1658
02:09:18,481 --> 02:09:18,781
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1659
02:09:19,161 --> 02:09:23,162
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, anyhow, DarkSakura, I know you like the ColecoVision.

1660
02:09:23,582 --> 02:09:24,002
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1661
02:09:24,122 --> 02:09:26,843
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm sure this news has you either very excited or very scared.

1662
02:09:27,824 --> 02:09:29,004
[SPEAKER_05]: There's going to be an iOS app.

1663
02:09:29,184 --> 02:09:57,582
[SPEAKER_05]: That is going to invoke the ColecoVision through emulation and all that It was on Kickstarter, I guess, at one point Oh no, it is right now, actually Trying to seek... I thought that this was already funded, but I guess not They were doing this whole little countdown thing And I thought, oh, they're going to unveil the app Well, I guess they unveiled the Kickstarter But it's Rant Media Games who did the original Vetrex Regeneration Which is a pretty good little app if you played it

1664
02:09:57,822 --> 02:09:58,283
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1665
02:10:15,359 --> 02:10:17,442
[SPEAKER_05]: Check out the box art, check out the cartridge.

1666
02:10:17,722 --> 02:10:20,426
[SPEAKER_05]: The Vetrex one is pretty cool, if you haven't already played it.

1667
02:10:20,726 --> 02:10:23,450
[SPEAKER_05]: They do have the rights to 19 different games.

1668
02:10:23,931 --> 02:10:27,035
[SPEAKER_05]: And sorry, Casey Munchkin is not one of them.

1669
02:10:27,115 --> 02:10:28,897
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Casey Munchkin wasn't on the Clicovision.

1670
02:10:29,137 --> 02:10:29,358
[SPEAKER_05]: Wasn't?

1671
02:10:29,378 --> 02:10:30,800
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought that was the Clicovision.

1672
02:10:30,820 --> 02:10:32,362
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the Magnavox Odyssey, too.

1673
02:10:32,782 --> 02:10:33,202
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, man.

1674
02:10:33,222 --> 02:10:35,164
[SPEAKER_02]: Son of a bitch.

1675
02:10:36,185 --> 02:10:41,049
[SPEAKER_02]: All the games that they have lists on here, I'm quite excited for, actually, now that I look at the list.

1676
02:10:41,069 --> 02:10:41,449
[SPEAKER_05]: Space Fury.

1677
02:10:42,169 --> 02:10:45,732
[SPEAKER_05]: I had an Atari 2600, so all those other systems kind of blurred together for me.

1678
02:10:45,752 --> 02:10:48,194
[SPEAKER_03]: Space Fury is one of my favorite ClicoVision games.

1679
02:10:48,294 --> 02:10:51,977
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, there are some pretty good ones that I even noticed here, like Bump and Jump.

1680
02:10:52,037 --> 02:10:52,618
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember that.

1681
02:10:52,678 --> 02:10:53,939
[SPEAKER_05]: Jumpman and Jumpman Jr.

1682
02:10:53,959 --> 02:10:55,240
[SPEAKER_05]: I certainly remember from the 64.

1683
02:10:55,300 --> 02:10:56,341
[SPEAKER_05]: Montezuma's Revenge.

1684
02:10:56,381 --> 02:10:56,881
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, my God.

1685
02:10:57,201 --> 02:10:58,082
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a huge game.

1686
02:10:59,223 --> 02:10:59,803
[SPEAKER_05]: Zaxxon.

1687
02:11:00,104 --> 02:11:01,725
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the one you're looking at, Loki?

1688
02:11:02,205 --> 02:11:07,709
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I used to play a ton of Bump and Jump and actually a ton of Jumpman Jr., Frenzy, Space Fury, and Zaxxon.

1689
02:11:08,089 --> 02:11:11,271
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I've played, and Pepper too, I think I've actually played most of these games.

1690
02:11:11,512 --> 02:11:14,113
[SPEAKER_02]: Except for Antarctic Adventure, I don't recognize that or Destructor.

1691
02:11:14,133 --> 02:11:16,095
[SPEAKER_01]: There are two games that I would want to be on that list.

1692
02:11:16,755 --> 02:11:17,856
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of them would be Venture.

1693
02:11:19,497 --> 02:11:22,079
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other one would be Gorf.

1694
02:11:23,520 --> 02:11:25,261
[SPEAKER_01]: I would put money into it if they had Gorf.

1695
02:11:26,027 --> 02:11:28,550
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love the little, like, the boxing.

1696
02:11:28,730 --> 02:11:31,473
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a bunch of different animated banners and stuff.

1697
02:11:31,573 --> 02:11:36,698
[SPEAKER_02]: And for platforms, they have the Rocky IV game on there, which is awesome.

1698
02:11:37,259 --> 02:11:39,321
[SPEAKER_02]: They have the special controller for it and everything.

1699
02:11:40,843 --> 02:11:41,203
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1700
02:11:41,523 --> 02:11:58,171
[SPEAKER_05]: so um they're looking for a quarter million dollars on kickstarter they've got five thousand after the first five days which is supposed to be like kind of like the biggest push i don't know i'm gonna be just completely honest i think a quarter million is too much money for a project like this and i understand they justify it and i

1701
02:11:59,412 --> 02:12:28,120
[SPEAKER_05]: you know it's not that I'm thinking like oh you know they're not like they're asking for too much money and we don't really know where it's going I get it they got to get the licensing and all this stuff and that's where a bunch of it is going so that the whole thing is legal and all that but I just think at the end of the day you're going to ask for a quarter million dollars for an iOS app of a system that is so old and I just I don't think there's going to be enough people that are interested I'm sorry like I know that sounds really cruel but especially when we were talking about a lot of retro love earlier but

1702
02:12:28,920 --> 02:12:31,101
[SPEAKER_05]: That's, yeah, I don't think they're going to hit it.

1703
02:12:31,441 --> 02:12:37,564
[SPEAKER_05]: If they do, great, more power to them, and I would love to check out the game when it comes out, but I don't know.

1704
02:12:37,864 --> 02:12:39,725
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a lot of money to try and get off Kickstarter.

1705
02:12:41,146 --> 02:12:41,826
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you guys think?

1706
02:12:41,846 --> 02:12:42,406
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think I'm right?

1707
02:12:42,426 --> 02:12:43,287
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think I'm being cruel?

1708
02:12:43,807 --> 02:12:46,488
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think that they're going to hit it, but I wish it was.

1709
02:12:46,728 --> 02:12:48,189
[SPEAKER_03]: They'd hit it if they had Gorfin Venture.

1710
02:12:50,103 --> 02:13:05,611
[SPEAKER_02]: My thing though is seriously is how these games, I mean because they have a numpad on that thing and then the joystick is really weird so it'd be interesting to see how this is going to translate over to the actual to playing it.

1711
02:13:06,011 --> 02:13:13,956
[SPEAKER_05]: Every time I get excited about a retro game collection on iPad I walk away really disappointed because the touch controls just suck.

1712
02:13:14,416 --> 02:13:18,018
[SPEAKER_05]: Now ever since I got the iCade that's improved things significantly.

1713
02:13:18,038 --> 02:13:18,458
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah the Vectrex

1714
02:13:18,558 --> 02:13:19,258
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1715
02:13:49,459 --> 02:13:51,160
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, anyhow, sorry to be Debbie Downer.

1716
02:13:51,360 --> 02:13:53,101
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, what do you got?

1717
02:13:53,141 --> 02:13:53,622
[SPEAKER_01]: Some stuff.

1718
02:13:55,503 --> 02:13:58,165
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the goddamn stupid iPad.

1719
02:14:00,186 --> 02:14:02,268
[SPEAKER_05]: You get frustrated by the touch controls, too.

1720
02:14:03,269 --> 02:14:03,769
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?

1721
02:14:03,809 --> 02:14:05,250
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this thing is touched in the head.

1722
02:14:05,931 --> 02:14:10,394
[SPEAKER_01]: So, THQ is suing EA and Zufa.

1723
02:14:12,269 --> 02:14:17,376
[SPEAKER_01]: And what they are suing about this time is... Everybody's fucking suing everybody.

1724
02:14:18,617 --> 02:14:21,981
[SPEAKER_01]: They're suing about the UFC game.

1725
02:14:22,822 --> 02:14:27,147
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, EA was going to be releasing the EA Sports UFC in 2014.

1726
02:14:29,029 --> 02:14:46,196
[SPEAKER_01]: and because they gained the license for that in June 2012 which was six months before THQ did and so since basically THQ was bankrupt Zufa paid looks like 10 million for breaking the contract

1727
02:14:49,361 --> 02:14:52,543
[SPEAKER_01]: and THQ says that no, we were supposed to receive double that.

1728
02:14:53,264 --> 02:14:55,245
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it's money.

1729
02:14:55,606 --> 02:14:59,408
[SPEAKER_01]: We're bankrupt, we need the money, we need to pay back our attorney fees, that type of thing.

1730
02:14:59,789 --> 02:15:09,375
[SPEAKER_02]: I think for what it was is I think that basically EA had insider information regarding THQ's financial standing and they let the company...

1731
02:15:10,776 --> 02:15:18,384
[SPEAKER_02]: They let the other company know about that and were able to negotiate a better deal because of that.

1732
02:15:19,305 --> 02:15:27,012
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they're pissed off that insider information was leaked out about THQ.

1733
02:15:28,173 --> 02:15:30,416
[SPEAKER_02]: It is kind of funny to see THQ suing

1734
02:15:32,140 --> 02:15:52,265
[SPEAKER_05]: I am THQ It's more like their lawyer I am Spartacus Get off my lawn and give me another 10 million dollars Yeah, seriously, it's whatever lawyer now represents him Seriously, so yeah

1735
02:15:53,750 --> 02:15:55,471
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's move on, Loki.

1736
02:15:56,211 --> 02:16:02,553
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so since we've been talking a little bit about crowdfunding, this is kind of interesting.

1737
02:16:03,193 --> 02:16:07,994
[SPEAKER_02]: Square Enix has this new partnership with Indiegogo.

1738
02:16:08,794 --> 02:16:10,255
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called The Collective.

1739
02:16:10,955 --> 02:16:32,465
[SPEAKER_02]: And what it is, is basically this Indiegogo curated page that's going to allow people to vote over the course of 28 days on different project pitches, including rebooting an old franchise from Eidos.

1740
02:16:33,466 --> 02:16:33,786
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

1741
02:16:36,169 --> 02:16:36,489
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1742
02:16:36,529 --> 02:16:37,970
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds interesting, I guess.

1743
02:16:38,250 --> 02:16:42,572
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's kind of weird, though, that we have to go to crowdfunding to do that sort of thing.

1744
02:16:43,252 --> 02:16:43,853
[SPEAKER_02]: But whatever.

1745
02:16:45,674 --> 02:16:49,435
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically, you know, you can pitch your ideas to developers.

1746
02:16:50,156 --> 02:16:52,457
[SPEAKER_02]: And if people like those ideas, they may run with it.

1747
02:16:53,017 --> 02:16:57,559
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, whenever I see something like this, it's kind of like, yeah, we've run out of ideas.

1748
02:16:57,579 --> 02:17:01,681
[SPEAKER_02]: Why don't you guys give us ideas and we'll make money off of them.

1749
02:17:02,001 --> 02:17:02,221
[SPEAKER_02]: You know.

1750
02:17:03,561 --> 02:17:04,082
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

1751
02:17:15,379 --> 02:17:19,042
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm assuming since it's partnered with Indiegogo, does that mean we have to fund it too?

1752
02:17:20,683 --> 02:17:24,306
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we going to have to fund this game that you're going to make money off of?

1753
02:17:25,026 --> 02:17:26,027
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little weird, isn't it?

1754
02:17:26,047 --> 02:17:32,112
[SPEAKER_02]: You're a big company, and you can't... You don't really have a say in it, you just pre-order it.

1755
02:17:32,132 --> 02:17:36,775
[SPEAKER_02]: You're at the point where you're like, yeah, it's a big company, we're just not going to take any risks anymore.

1756
02:17:36,935 --> 02:17:38,857
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to let you take the risks for us.

1757
02:17:39,177 --> 02:17:41,479
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of what it sounds like to me.

1758
02:17:43,100 --> 02:17:44,102
[SPEAKER_02]: So many pitches free.

1759
02:17:44,482 --> 02:17:50,611
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're actually interested in this whole thing, collective.square-enix.com Check it out.

1760
02:17:50,971 --> 02:17:52,213
[SPEAKER_05]: There might be some cool ideas there.

1761
02:17:52,233 --> 02:17:57,541
[SPEAKER_05]: As long as they're not asking us to crowdfund all the bravest too, we'll be fine.

1762
02:17:58,264 --> 02:17:58,905
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

1763
02:18:19,039 --> 02:18:25,382
[SPEAKER_05]: He was talking about, in an interview with, I guess, I'm not sure where it was.

1764
02:18:25,642 --> 02:18:27,183
[SPEAKER_05]: Was it a Japanese magazine or what?

1765
02:18:28,404 --> 02:18:29,844
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, I can't properly credit this here.

1766
02:18:30,785 --> 02:18:40,989
[SPEAKER_05]: He was talking about the Kickstarter success and that if Capcom were to make an offer about publishing the game, he would go with Capcom.

1767
02:18:41,409 --> 02:18:44,411
[SPEAKER_05]: And saying, quote, there is no reason not to publish with Capcom.

1768
02:18:45,431 --> 02:19:06,057
[SPEAKER_05]: he also talked about possibly turning this into a Mega Man title if Capcom possibly wanted to go that way now he is more hesitant about this idea but he didn't come out and exactly say no to it which the gaming media is like kind of leeching onto a bit too much I think but whatever it says he and his crew really want this to be their thing

1769
02:19:08,158 --> 02:19:35,468
[SPEAKER_05]: so I kind of think we're grabbing on a little too much about the quote that you know if Capcom want to make it a Mega Man game I just I really think that was a poor decision to even let that thought go out there because like seriously like I crowdfunded all this stuff just for this to come out and be another Mega Man game don't get me wrong I like Mega Man but it's like it's weird I just don't think that they could do this at this point because how would they go about making this be a Mega Man I guess other than calling it Mega Man I mean

1770
02:19:35,988 --> 02:19:36,588
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

1771
02:19:54,314 --> 02:20:08,612
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but, I don't know, I mean, maybe the joke is that it's so close to Mega Man, you might as well just call it Mega Man, you know, and if Capcom paid them some money, they'll just call it Mega Man, and it'll be a Mega Man game, because it's essentially Mega Man.

1772
02:20:11,144 --> 02:20:12,185
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they're drawing straws.

1773
02:20:13,206 --> 02:20:13,566
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1774
02:20:14,247 --> 02:20:19,271
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to pause recording here real quick because unfortunately our stream is down at server room.

1775
02:20:20,511 --> 02:20:21,592
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, thank you, server room.

1776
02:20:21,612 --> 02:20:22,113
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, right?

1777
02:20:22,173 --> 02:20:28,178
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll be right back here after a quick... For the podcast listeners, we'll be right back after a quick little music note here.

1778
02:20:28,778 --> 02:20:30,820
[SPEAKER_05]: And we'll talk a little more about this and some other news.

1779
02:20:38,999 --> 02:20:41,400
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, and we're back here at Orange Lounge Radio.

1780
02:20:41,440 --> 02:20:44,780
[SPEAKER_05]: Unfortunately, some technical difficulties that were a little bit out of our control.

1781
02:20:45,921 --> 02:20:55,283
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll be following up with our hosting provider this week and figuring out why on two Sundays in a row they have decided to reset the server or whatever they're doing that is causing the show to drop out.

1782
02:20:55,583 --> 02:21:01,245
[SPEAKER_05]: And if they can't give us a good answer, we will look into a different provider for a future broadcast.

1783
02:21:01,345 --> 02:21:01,945
[SPEAKER_05]: In the meantime...

1784
02:21:02,765 --> 02:21:04,007
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's get back where we left off.

1785
02:21:04,027 --> 02:21:05,589
[SPEAKER_05]: We've been talking about Mighty No.

1786
02:21:05,609 --> 02:21:10,554
[SPEAKER_05]: 9 and the whole Mega Man thing and the fact that it was Kickstarted.

1787
02:21:11,115 --> 02:21:19,765
[SPEAKER_05]: And the only other thing I wanted to get out with this is that I get why he says if Capcom makes the best publishing deal, then that's the company they're going to go with.

1788
02:21:19,805 --> 02:21:21,387
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just business, right?

1789
02:21:21,487 --> 02:21:22,769
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think they're going to be.

1790
02:21:23,930 --> 02:21:30,414
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that was kind of like interview bait I think somebody baited him to say that for a headline like oh Mighty No.

1791
02:21:30,434 --> 02:21:52,147
[SPEAKER_05]: 9 is going to go through Capcom and it's going to be ironic it probably won't it could but I mean the way Capcom's been going lately and the fact that they you know kind of denied this guy the Mega Man game he wants to make do you think they're really going to come back and make the best deal to publish it probably not I think somebody else will and that'll be that so all right

1792
02:21:53,887 --> 02:21:56,988
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, let's move on to our mailbag.

1793
02:21:57,108 --> 02:21:59,149
[SPEAKER_05]: Every week you guys send us emails.

1794
02:21:59,249 --> 02:22:05,551
[SPEAKER_05]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com And we go through the mailbag and try to read some of our favorite emails here live.

1795
02:22:07,571 --> 02:22:09,652
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, dive into that mailbag.

1796
02:22:09,712 --> 02:22:13,353
[SPEAKER_05]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com And tell us what emails we have tonight.

1797
02:22:13,593 --> 02:22:14,113
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a few.

1798
02:22:15,714 --> 02:22:18,875
[SPEAKER_01]: I will start with the first one from the Nasty Canasta.

1799
02:22:20,600 --> 02:22:21,281
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, OLR.

1800
02:22:21,321 --> 02:22:26,205
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to give my impressions on a game that's soon to be re-released, Deus Ex Human Revolution.

1801
02:22:26,706 --> 02:22:34,312
[SPEAKER_01]: I was sitting in my big-ass PC backlog for nearly two years when I finally got around to playing it.

1802
02:22:34,472 --> 02:22:37,295
[SPEAKER_01]: I sunk a solid hundred hours into it within the span of a month.

1803
02:22:38,896 --> 02:22:40,057
[SPEAKER_01]: This is going into the story.

1804
02:22:40,218 --> 02:22:44,341
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to skip forward because I don't want to spoil for anyone who might play it.

1805
02:22:45,342 --> 02:22:50,164
[SPEAKER_01]: So a game with an engaging plot needs some kickass gameplay to back it up, and Deus Ex delivers for the most part.

1806
02:22:50,664 --> 02:23:02,488
[SPEAKER_01]: In this first-person RPG, you can be gung-ho by making use of the guns to blast the shit out of people, take a more merciful route by knocking out enemies, sneaking, and hacking your way through areas, or a combination of all three.

1807
02:23:03,408 --> 02:23:08,810
[SPEAKER_01]: It is up to you to play however you want, though you'll be making progressively harder choices as you get closer to the end.

1808
02:23:09,130 --> 02:23:11,951
[SPEAKER_01]: For the record, I watched Becky's husband play through a little bit of this.

1809
02:23:12,111 --> 02:23:12,831
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really good.

1810
02:23:14,443 --> 02:23:18,665
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I say the game delivers for the most part, because there are some significant flaws.

1811
02:23:19,225 --> 02:23:23,666
[SPEAKER_01]: First, the games occasionally bug you with handling ragdolls, especially when they clip and get stuck in floors.

1812
02:23:24,066 --> 02:23:24,347
[SPEAKER_01]: Icky.

1813
02:23:25,187 --> 02:23:30,789
[SPEAKER_01]: Second, while the game rewards XP for various actions you do, you are awarded the most points for playing pacifist with stealth.

1814
02:23:31,669 --> 02:23:37,871
[SPEAKER_01]: Although you can play however you want, the XP rewards are pretty much big neon signs saying, "'Want this augmentation?

1815
02:23:37,931 --> 02:23:39,072
[SPEAKER_01]: Do melee takedowns, bro!'

1816
02:23:40,072 --> 02:23:40,633
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1817
02:23:57,708 --> 02:24:03,633
[SPEAKER_01]: Despite these problems, I highly encourage everyone to try it out, especially if you have a PC or got the game through PlayStation Plus.

1818
02:24:04,574 --> 02:24:07,416
[SPEAKER_01]: The re-release fixes boss fights for pacifist players.

1819
02:24:13,829 --> 02:24:22,933
[SPEAKER_01]: has touchscreen players for all platforms, Wii U, Game Pass, Smart Glass, PS3, Vita, Cross Control, and TBA for PC, and bundles in all the DLC content.

1820
02:24:23,393 --> 02:24:26,894
[SPEAKER_01]: And before I forget, the game looks absolutely gorgeous and the soundtrack is fantastic.

1821
02:24:27,054 --> 02:24:28,455
[SPEAKER_01]: And that comes from the nasty Canasta.

1822
02:24:30,009 --> 02:24:30,309
[SPEAKER_01]: So, next email?

1823
02:25:00,186 --> 02:25:00,386
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1824
02:25:01,207 --> 02:25:01,327
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

1825
02:25:21,702 --> 02:25:22,563
[SPEAKER_01]: and my bigger hands.

1826
02:25:22,703 --> 02:25:30,929
[SPEAKER_01]: It's minimalist design features and price are all I'm looking for in a system to play on the couch at home or throw my laptop bag on the go.

1827
02:25:31,569 --> 02:25:41,977
[SPEAKER_01]: I think anyone wanting to get access to the 3DS library and doesn't care about 3D should at least consider a 2DS as I personally think it is the best feeling portable in some time.

1828
02:25:42,637 --> 02:25:47,901
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, the $70 cheaper price more than makes up for the smaller screen than the XL.

1829
02:25:49,322 --> 02:25:54,566
[SPEAKER_01]: On a side note, I'm already six hours into Pokemon and I'm not the type of gamer that typically plays that much at a time.

1830
02:25:55,006 --> 02:25:59,650
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't played a Pokemon game since the GBA, so I'm not exactly the typical Pokemon fanatic either.

1831
02:26:00,290 --> 02:26:08,316
[SPEAKER_01]: So while lots of people are talking next gen, I'm going to be perfectly happy with my new Wii U and 2DS combo for the foreseeable future.

1832
02:26:08,856 --> 02:26:12,419
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't wait for Super Mario 3D World and the new Legend of Zelda for 3DS.

1833
02:26:12,659 --> 02:26:13,179
[SPEAKER_01]: Love the show.

1834
02:26:13,259 --> 02:26:13,679
[SPEAKER_01]: Take care.

1835
02:26:13,800 --> 02:26:14,320
[SPEAKER_01]: Monty Boggs.

1836
02:26:16,795 --> 02:26:17,855
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad that you're enjoying it.

1837
02:26:18,875 --> 02:26:19,896
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like he is quite in joy.

1838
02:26:20,776 --> 02:26:21,336
[SPEAKER_05]: Quite in joy.

1839
02:26:21,496 --> 02:26:21,876
[SPEAKER_01]: Quite in joy.

1840
02:26:21,896 --> 02:26:23,897
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, we have two emails left.

1841
02:26:24,217 --> 02:26:24,917
[SPEAKER_01]: One of them is long.

1842
02:26:25,257 --> 02:26:25,737
[SPEAKER_01]: Kinda long.

1843
02:26:27,437 --> 02:26:28,558
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello, OLR gang.

1844
02:26:28,958 --> 02:26:35,399
[SPEAKER_01]: This is my first time giving my voice to the show, being on the East Coast and having to be up Monday at 5.30am.

1845
02:26:35,719 --> 02:26:37,620
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not able to listen to your show live.

1846
02:26:37,840 --> 02:26:41,001
[SPEAKER_01]: I do, however, listen to every episode while I'm at work every Monday morning.

1847
02:26:41,581 --> 02:26:42,421
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm glad you do.

1848
02:26:42,461 --> 02:26:42,801
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1849
02:26:44,389 --> 02:26:48,554
[SPEAKER_01]: I am a 34-year-old gamer who started gaming fairly late compared to you guys.

1850
02:26:48,914 --> 02:26:53,540
[SPEAKER_01]: My first console was the original Oness.

1851
02:26:56,063 --> 02:27:03,332
[SPEAKER_01]: My parents were not a fan of me spending time on gaming and not interacting with people, so I never got another console until I was older and able to purchase my own.

1852
02:27:03,912 --> 02:27:04,253
[SPEAKER_01]: Good choices.

1853
02:27:23,368 --> 02:27:23,809
[SPEAKER_01]: Dark Ages of Camelot

1854
02:27:41,124 --> 02:27:46,506
[SPEAKER_01]: I've played WoW, Star Wars Galaxy, Star Wars The Old Republic, Champions Online, Guild Wars 2, Neverwinter, just to name a few.

1855
02:27:47,066 --> 02:27:48,767
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure there are more that I'm forgetting about.

1856
02:27:49,287 --> 02:27:55,749
[SPEAKER_01]: Currently I decided to see what all the hype about Mass Effect was all about so I purchased the trilogy during the summer months when it was on sale.

1857
02:27:56,289 --> 02:27:59,070
[SPEAKER_01]: I've played through all of Mass Effect 1 and 2 and I'm currently working on 3.

1858
02:27:59,830 --> 02:28:05,472
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have to say I've enjoyed the storyline but there are some things that annoy me about the games like in Mass Effect 2 and Mass Effect 3.

1859
02:28:05,952 --> 02:28:09,893
[SPEAKER_01]: Not being able to open the journal without hitting escape and then clicking the journal menu item.

1860
02:28:10,733 --> 02:28:12,495
[SPEAKER_01]: Why couldn't they make a keybind for stuff like that?

1861
02:28:12,916 --> 02:28:16,879
[SPEAKER_01]: By the way, I think some of the menu differences in that were just with the differences of the Unreal Engine.

1862
02:28:17,760 --> 02:28:18,421
[SPEAKER_01]: I do believe.

1863
02:28:18,941 --> 02:28:21,244
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you'll notice also their texture rendering was different.

1864
02:28:21,264 --> 02:28:22,505
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the menu systems are different.

1865
02:28:24,492 --> 02:28:48,589
[SPEAKER_01]: um also I think if you are playing on PC you can create a bind to load your journal but you have to mod your um uh your coalesced INI to put that in there and if you go to my tumblr massaffecting.tumblr.com I will see if I can find the answer to that and show you how to make the key bind might even share my own coalesced INI with you um

1866
02:28:50,014 --> 02:28:53,055
[SPEAKER_01]: Just saying, because I totally end up modding my games.

1867
02:28:55,316 --> 02:28:57,437
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways, enough about me.

1868
02:28:58,178 --> 02:29:00,039
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought I was about to say Mass Effect, but it's actually me.

1869
02:29:00,579 --> 02:29:11,384
[SPEAKER_01]: My question for you guys to ponder, with Valve's latest announcements about the Steam Machine and SteamOS, do you think this could have game makers start considering PC gaming as a viable competitor in the console war?

1870
02:29:12,697 --> 02:29:16,684
[SPEAKER_01]: With a five-year-old daughter, I have had to focus my gaming on PC.

1871
02:29:17,085 --> 02:29:23,897
[SPEAKER_01]: With a second child on the way in June, I've had to put my plans to purchase the next gen in the new year on the back burner.

1872
02:29:24,438 --> 02:29:25,300
[SPEAKER_01]: By the way, congratulations.

1873
02:29:27,744 --> 02:29:50,709
[SPEAKER_01]: I do however have a fairly powerful i5 dual core with 60 gigabytes of RAM PC that I thought could handle most of the games that will be coming out I'm hoping my thoughts on the Steam machines and Steam OS bringing PC gaming into direct competition with consoles is true so more games will come out for PC and the ones that do come out will come out around the same times as console unlike GTA 5 um

1874
02:29:54,642 --> 02:29:55,122
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't you think?

1875
02:30:22,290 --> 02:30:26,236
[SPEAKER_05]: If you think that the oncoming Steam Box and Steam OS will cause PC gaming to be more of a competitor to the console market

1876
02:30:38,453 --> 02:30:39,273
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think so.

1877
02:30:39,893 --> 02:30:45,476
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so early to say because the price is a huge motivator in that regard.

1878
02:30:48,137 --> 02:30:49,798
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1879
02:30:49,898 --> 02:30:56,482
[SPEAKER_05]: The Steam Machine is trying to take things closer to a dedicated game processor and device, but it's not really one.

1880
02:30:57,202 --> 02:31:03,924
[SPEAKER_05]: It's more dedicated than maybe a Windows machine is, but it's not solely dedicated like a PlayStation or an Xbox is.

1881
02:31:04,364 --> 02:31:10,386
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm not sure that certain things that you do on a gaming console will necessarily be possible on one of these devices.

1882
02:31:10,546 --> 02:31:10,966
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1883
02:31:11,146 --> 02:31:14,147
[SPEAKER_05]: I sort of just think there's still room for the consoles.

1884
02:31:14,407 --> 02:31:22,809
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's some potential there, but what my point was is that a lot of times when you're dealing with the consumer market, people are slow to switch up what works.

1885
02:31:24,815 --> 02:31:27,838
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't want to make the big risk unless they're completely desperate.

1886
02:31:30,200 --> 02:31:31,381
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, thanks for the great shows.

1887
02:31:31,501 --> 02:31:35,264
[SPEAKER_01]: I love listening to the many shows on VOG including Bobby Show, OLR, and Horde House.

1888
02:31:36,165 --> 02:31:41,149
[SPEAKER_01]: The shows help to make my work week a lot more interesting and have a great one, Cyber Judge.

1889
02:31:41,429 --> 02:31:42,450
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for emailing us.

1890
02:31:42,750 --> 02:31:43,050
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1891
02:31:43,390 --> 02:31:48,254
[SPEAKER_05]: I like hearing from the veterans and the people that talk to us frequently but I like hearing from new people too.

1892
02:31:49,175 --> 02:31:50,736
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like hearing from new people.

1893
02:31:52,118 --> 02:31:53,299
[SPEAKER_01]: Although I love all of you guys.

1894
02:31:54,952 --> 02:31:55,632
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey guys!

1895
02:31:56,292 --> 02:31:56,633
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey!

1896
02:31:57,593 --> 02:32:07,356
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've been trying to get into gaming, but even though I have a dual box MacBook Pro, I still wonder what game I should play since I am broke as a joke.

1897
02:32:07,976 --> 02:32:10,597
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I know Final Fantasy XIV is out, but I cannot afford it.

1898
02:32:10,697 --> 02:32:13,518
[SPEAKER_01]: I enjoyed it during the open beta, but a connection, etc.

1899
02:32:13,598 --> 02:32:15,578
[SPEAKER_01]: issue kept me from really enjoying it.

1900
02:32:16,119 --> 02:32:20,080
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish I could afford it while I'm looking for a job, but it's going to be a little hard for me too.

1901
02:32:20,740 --> 02:32:23,061
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you guys think that it's...

1902
02:32:24,582 --> 02:32:28,006
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you guys think that it's one of those games that will last for a while like Eleven did?

1903
02:32:28,626 --> 02:32:31,470
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there any Mac or PC games you think I should try in your opinion?

1904
02:32:31,530 --> 02:32:31,950
[SPEAKER_01]: That's free.

1905
02:32:32,871 --> 02:32:33,993
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for answering me.

1906
02:32:34,093 --> 02:32:35,715
[SPEAKER_01]: If so, you're a listener of many years.

1907
02:32:35,875 --> 02:32:36,015
[SPEAKER_01]: Uni.

1908
02:32:38,757 --> 02:32:45,043
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, if your computer is solid enough to run Final Fantasy XIV at all during the beta, then there's a lot of free-to-play stuff out there that you can check out.

1909
02:32:45,083 --> 02:32:47,905
[SPEAKER_05]: And some of those are, you know, MMO-type things.

1910
02:32:47,965 --> 02:32:49,607
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you've got Star Wars, The Old Republic.

1911
02:32:49,627 --> 02:32:50,828
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know how many of these are on Mac.

1912
02:32:50,848 --> 02:32:51,669
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the problem.

1913
02:32:51,709 --> 02:32:54,251
[SPEAKER_01]: Ragnarok Online, I think, might.

1914
02:32:54,671 --> 02:32:55,592
[SPEAKER_01]: Ragnarok 2, anyway.

1915
02:32:56,313 --> 02:33:04,260
[SPEAKER_01]: But I used to play the old-school Ragnarok Online through free servers on a Mac using an emulator.

1916
02:33:05,578 --> 02:33:06,518
[SPEAKER_05]: Star Wars The Old Republic, Rift

1917
02:33:21,983 --> 02:33:49,397
[SPEAKER_05]: more MMOs even things like Star Trek Online Marvel Heroes is a pretty fun to play one if you like Diablo at all and you like your comic book people that's free to play as well even things that are like up a totally different alley like Spiral Knights for Sega is there you know there's there's more and more free to play stuff on Steam that's worth checking out and Steam's gonna make it very clear what's on Mac and what's not and you can also if it's still going on the not on Steam sale because I do believe there were some Mac titles included in that

1918
02:33:50,217 --> 02:33:50,477
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

1919
02:33:50,497 --> 02:33:52,478
[SPEAKER_01]: They weren't free, but they were pretty cheap.

1920
02:33:52,518 --> 02:33:53,139
[SPEAKER_01]: Low, low cost, yeah.

1921
02:33:53,159 --> 02:33:53,839
[SPEAKER_01]: They were pretty cheap.

1922
02:33:54,119 --> 02:33:54,319
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1923
02:33:54,720 --> 02:34:04,265
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't be afraid to play stuff that's maybe under the radar, because there's some great indie games and things that, you know, maybe not everybody's necessarily into right at this moment that are still worth you checking out.

1924
02:34:04,325 --> 02:34:16,492
[SPEAKER_01]: I also do suggest installing, what is it called, for, not Flash, but it's a game engine that runs through browsers that the Disney games, like the Wreck-It-Ralph games used.

1925
02:34:16,512 --> 02:34:16,572
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh.

1926
02:34:17,052 --> 02:34:21,736
[SPEAKER_05]: Uni's actually in our chat right now saying that she has dual boxed Windows 7 and Mac Mountain Lion.

1927
02:34:21,856 --> 02:34:23,758
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, well then you're good for a lot of these games we're talking.

1928
02:34:24,038 --> 02:34:29,923
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want MMOs, I would say check out The Old Republic if you even remotely like Bioware games or Star Wars.

1929
02:34:30,564 --> 02:34:33,346
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think you necessarily even have to like Star Wars to enjoy The Old Republic.

1930
02:34:33,406 --> 02:34:34,827
[SPEAKER_05]: I still think it's a pretty good game on its own.

1931
02:34:35,408 --> 02:34:36,589
[SPEAKER_05]: And Rift for sure.

1932
02:34:36,829 --> 02:34:39,311
[SPEAKER_05]: If you liked Warcraft, you'd probably like Rift.

1933
02:34:39,351 --> 02:34:44,135
[SPEAKER_01]: And someone might gift you Mass Effect when it goes for sale again.

1934
02:34:44,275 --> 02:34:45,036
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody super nice.

1935
02:34:45,703 --> 02:34:48,964
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's a really nice person sitting at this table right now.

1936
02:34:49,364 --> 02:34:54,945
[SPEAKER_05]: DungeonBuster in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says Neverwinter is a pretty decent free-to-play Dungeons & Dragons MMO.

1937
02:34:54,985 --> 02:34:55,885
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I've heard of that one too.

1938
02:34:55,905 --> 02:34:56,345
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Unity.

1939
02:34:57,065 --> 02:35:00,166
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I thought it was, but I didn't quite want to call it.

1940
02:35:00,566 --> 02:35:01,106
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you're wrong.

1941
02:35:02,327 --> 02:35:03,247
[SPEAKER_05]: So is that it for emails?

1942
02:35:03,787 --> 02:35:04,027
[SPEAKER_01]: Yarp.

1943
02:35:04,247 --> 02:35:04,627
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

1944
02:35:04,687 --> 02:35:08,308
[SPEAKER_05]: Mailbag at orangeloundtrader.com if you have a question for a future week.

1945
02:35:09,148 --> 02:35:11,188
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, let's do the FUs of the week, folks.

1946
02:35:12,729 --> 02:35:13,429
[SPEAKER_05]: Because we're mad.

1947
02:35:31,090 --> 02:35:31,930
[SPEAKER_01]: F you to my stepdad.

1948
02:35:33,111 --> 02:35:45,037
[SPEAKER_01]: And to put this in the most general of terms, just because somebody else doesn't believe something that you do or doesn't agree with you does not mean that they're closed-minded.

1949
02:35:45,577 --> 02:35:49,419
[SPEAKER_01]: For all you know, they could have done their research and found that it's not for them.

1950
02:35:50,639 --> 02:36:02,867
[SPEAKER_01]: Using inflammatory statements to try to guilt trip somebody into changing their opinion or into evoking an emotional response that makes you look like you're staying calm is no way to have a discussion.

1951
02:36:02,947 --> 02:36:05,328
[SPEAKER_01]: It's immature and it is beneath you and I am done.

1952
02:36:06,369 --> 02:36:07,830
[SPEAKER_05]: What you showed me was pretty tacky.

1953
02:36:08,690 --> 02:36:10,491
[SPEAKER_05]: That's really the best word I can think of for it.

1954
02:36:10,771 --> 02:36:11,132
[SPEAKER_05]: Tacky.

1955
02:36:12,352 --> 02:36:12,673
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki.

1956
02:36:14,854 --> 02:36:17,375
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh... I don't know.

1957
02:36:17,395 --> 02:36:17,916
[SPEAKER_02]: F you to...

1958
02:36:23,639 --> 02:36:24,480
[SPEAKER_05]: It's become your life.

1959
02:36:25,421 --> 02:36:27,222
[SPEAKER_05]: F you to the fact that I don't have a voice today.

1960
02:36:28,043 --> 02:36:29,965
[SPEAKER_05]: F you to stress making me sick when I eat.

1961
02:36:30,645 --> 02:36:34,469
[SPEAKER_05]: And F you to the fact that our show cut out while we're trying to do it.

1962
02:36:35,390 --> 02:36:36,030
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate that.

1963
02:36:36,150 --> 02:36:37,632
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially when it's out of our control.

1964
02:36:38,352 --> 02:36:38,793
[SPEAKER_05]: Rawr.

1965
02:36:40,549 --> 02:36:57,677
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely a suitable FU of the week Alright, a couple more stories for you guys Then we'll open up the skyline for a little bit And try to do some Twitter topics as well too I'm going to warn you guys with this If you want to get in on the skyline tonight You need to call as soon as we open it up Because we're not going to be able to sit around tonight And wait for seven minutes going Is somebody going to call?

1966
02:36:58,057 --> 02:37:06,601
[SPEAKER_05]: So either you want to participate or you don't tonight You have a ten second window You better be on it But after two stories So Loki, you first

1967
02:37:06,741 --> 02:37:18,945
[SPEAKER_02]: So despite some sort of delay in the whole purchasing process thanks to the Delaware Supreme Court, the ruling has been made in favor of Activision.

1968
02:37:19,125 --> 02:37:28,308
[SPEAKER_02]: And yes, they will be allowed to buy the, I guess, $8.2 billion of their own shares from Vivendi in just a few days here on October 15th.

1969
02:37:28,368 --> 02:37:28,468
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

1970
02:37:31,890 --> 02:37:35,692
[SPEAKER_02]: They will become their own company again, I guess.

1971
02:37:36,052 --> 02:37:37,794
[SPEAKER_02]: Or more of their own company.

1972
02:37:37,994 --> 02:37:40,195
[SPEAKER_05]: So I remember hearing about this before a little bit.

1973
02:37:40,235 --> 02:37:43,497
[SPEAKER_05]: So the news here is that it's been approved, basically.

1974
02:37:43,837 --> 02:37:45,438
[SPEAKER_05]: Because there was concern.

1975
02:37:45,719 --> 02:37:47,160
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a shareholder.

1976
02:37:47,340 --> 02:37:51,162
[SPEAKER_02]: It was one of the shareholders that was saying that they were doing this to somehow...

1977
02:37:53,003 --> 02:37:55,566
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, somehow screw them out of money or something.

1978
02:37:55,586 --> 02:37:56,386
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how it was.

1979
02:37:58,188 --> 02:38:02,672
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, it basically got overturned so they can do it.

1980
02:38:03,252 --> 02:38:03,573
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

1981
02:38:05,172 --> 02:38:17,481
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, well, you know what, all the changes I've seen in World of Warcraft ever since this split have been for the better, so, and Diablo 3, hello, Auction House going away, that's great news, that's gonna bring a whole group of new people into the game, so, we'll see.

1982
02:38:18,041 --> 02:38:32,452
[SPEAKER_05]: Meanwhile, hey, Wii U owners, I know you have been waiting for that killer game that will finally just make this thing fuckin' fly off of shelves, and, uh, you know, it might be, it might be, you know, Mario 3D World 2 or whatever, it could be, it could be, uh, Mario Kart 8,

1983
02:38:33,132 --> 02:38:34,032
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1984
02:38:57,859 --> 02:39:05,127
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you can totally get a jacked version of Rainbow Road from the Mario Kart games with little Hello Kitty space planets.

1985
02:39:05,227 --> 02:39:06,609
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what else to call these things.

1986
02:39:06,969 --> 02:39:07,710
[SPEAKER_05]: From the back room.

1987
02:39:08,130 --> 02:39:09,632
[SPEAKER_01]: I wonder if you can play as little twin stars.

1988
02:39:10,256 --> 02:39:10,656
[SPEAKER_05]: Who knows?

1989
02:39:10,836 --> 02:39:12,337
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything's possible.

1990
02:39:12,957 --> 02:39:17,239
[SPEAKER_05]: So there are some screenshots available and yeah, you can check that out coming later this year.

1991
02:39:17,279 --> 02:39:21,281
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know how much and I don't know exactly what day, but it's Hello Kitty.

1992
02:39:21,401 --> 02:39:22,141
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's November 5th?

1993
02:39:22,761 --> 02:39:23,342
[SPEAKER_02]: And how much?

1994
02:39:23,402 --> 02:39:25,482
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's $40 if I remember correctly.

1995
02:39:25,783 --> 02:39:28,524
[SPEAKER_05]: The countdown is on and it's a slight budget title.

1996
02:39:29,164 --> 02:39:29,725
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1997
02:39:51,846 --> 02:39:52,807
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1998
02:40:11,894 --> 02:40:13,015
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1999
02:40:13,095 --> 02:40:21,179
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember when Sony went down for an entire day and everybody said, I'll never buy another Sony product again, and then they unveiled the PlayStation 4, and everybody was like, oh, never mind.

2000
02:40:21,199 --> 02:40:22,300
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just kidding.

2001
02:40:24,101 --> 02:40:25,342
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Sony went down for a long time.

2002
02:40:25,582 --> 02:40:27,703
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember when they had a problem with their clocks?

2003
02:40:27,723 --> 02:40:28,044
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

2004
02:40:29,745 --> 02:40:31,726
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, anyhow, let's do it.

2005
02:40:31,766 --> 02:40:32,866
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's get to some phone calls.

2006
02:40:32,886 --> 02:40:38,510
[SPEAKER_05]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio, but we already have a call coming in, so let's get to it.

2007
02:40:38,930 --> 02:40:39,950
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2008
02:40:39,971 --> 02:40:40,351
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's this?

2009
02:40:41,124 --> 02:40:43,025
[SPEAKER_09]: Yo guys, it's Xenacore from OKC.

2010
02:40:43,045 --> 02:40:43,525
[SPEAKER_09]: How you doing?

2011
02:40:43,625 --> 02:40:44,385
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, Xenacore.

2012
02:40:44,405 --> 02:40:45,505
[SPEAKER_05]: Good to hear from you as always.

2013
02:40:45,545 --> 02:40:45,965
[SPEAKER_05]: How are you?

2014
02:40:46,045 --> 02:40:46,426
[SPEAKER_05]: We're good.

2015
02:40:47,286 --> 02:40:50,947
[SPEAKER_09]: It's good to know I know about the right time for the delay in the radio to pick up.

2016
02:40:51,367 --> 02:40:52,607
[SPEAKER_05]: You've got this down to a science.

2017
02:40:52,627 --> 02:40:53,728
[SPEAKER_05]: You beat Ranma tonight.

2018
02:40:53,788 --> 02:40:54,368
[SPEAKER_05]: That's something.

2019
02:40:55,208 --> 02:40:55,528
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, cool.

2020
02:40:55,548 --> 02:40:56,688
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll put that on my list.

2021
02:40:57,389 --> 02:40:58,529
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, give yourself a gold star.

2022
02:40:58,909 --> 02:41:01,890
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, what's on your mind, buddy?

2023
02:41:02,010 --> 02:41:05,391
[SPEAKER_09]: The web game for the fan-made attack on Titan game.

2024
02:41:05,431 --> 02:41:07,712
[SPEAKER_09]: That thing is actually pretty damn polished.

2025
02:41:07,772 --> 02:41:08,472
[SPEAKER_09]: I was surprised.

2026
02:41:08,752 --> 02:41:08,972
[SPEAKER_09]: Hmm.

2027
02:41:10,310 --> 02:41:11,854
[SPEAKER_09]: Have you guys not seen it yet?

2028
02:41:12,015 --> 02:41:12,516
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I haven't.

2029
02:41:12,536 --> 02:41:13,719
[SPEAKER_09]: Tell us a little more about this.

2030
02:41:13,739 --> 02:41:17,208
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't been into the anime at all, so I've been pretty much ignoring it on Tumblr.

2031
02:41:18,974 --> 02:41:28,658
[SPEAKER_09]: Some guy used the Unity engine to make a fan-inspired version of Defending Humanity against the Titans, and it's pretty damn good.

2032
02:41:28,758 --> 02:41:29,718
[SPEAKER_09]: It plays really well.

2033
02:41:29,778 --> 02:41:33,240
[SPEAKER_09]: It almost feels like Spider-Man as far as the swinging mechanic is down.

2034
02:41:33,900 --> 02:41:37,621
[SPEAKER_09]: It's really intuitive after a couple matches, and it's just as deadly as the real game is.

2035
02:41:38,642 --> 02:41:41,543
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I highly encourage everybody to play it.

2036
02:41:43,143 --> 02:41:43,664
[SPEAKER_09]: How much is that?

2037
02:41:43,704 --> 02:41:44,324
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that a free one?

2038
02:41:44,975 --> 02:41:45,615
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah, it's free.

2039
02:41:45,635 --> 02:41:50,737
[SPEAKER_09]: This guy just made it and threw it up on the interwebs just because he loves the game.

2040
02:41:50,777 --> 02:41:53,157
[SPEAKER_09]: I just threw the link up there in chat if anyone wants to check it out.

2041
02:41:53,417 --> 02:41:55,898
[SPEAKER_09]: It's fangly.com slash game slash AOG.

2042
02:41:56,398 --> 02:42:00,099
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, there's something for the emailer a little bit ago who was looking for some free games to play.

2043
02:42:00,199 --> 02:42:00,639
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

2044
02:42:00,659 --> 02:42:01,939
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, there you go.

2045
02:42:02,420 --> 02:42:03,420
[SPEAKER_05]: What else have you been playing lately?

2046
02:42:04,500 --> 02:42:11,242
[SPEAKER_09]: That and some War Thunder Online just to get my air-to-air combat genes taken care of.

2047
02:42:11,262 --> 02:42:11,742
[SPEAKER_10]: Mm-hmm.

2048
02:42:12,744 --> 02:42:14,086
[SPEAKER_09]: That's done pretty well.

2049
02:42:14,126 --> 02:42:15,568
[SPEAKER_09]: They're getting ready to release the tanks too.

2050
02:42:15,608 --> 02:42:23,179
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently they're trying to do both land, sea, and air battles all in one massive arena game all of World War II.

2051
02:42:23,379 --> 02:42:24,521
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's quite extensive.

2052
02:42:24,561 --> 02:42:25,082
[SPEAKER_09]: It's really good.

2053
02:42:25,795 --> 02:42:28,717
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you a fan pretty regularly of these air fighting games?

2054
02:42:29,177 --> 02:42:29,837
[SPEAKER_05]: Like Ace Combat stuff?

2055
02:42:29,857 --> 02:42:30,418
[SPEAKER_05]: Every once in a while.

2056
02:42:30,598 --> 02:42:32,599
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, they just now started popping up.

2057
02:42:32,639 --> 02:42:38,462
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess since League of Legends took over, everybody's doing their own version of a massive online battle arena.

2058
02:42:39,503 --> 02:42:43,465
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I didn't even realize they kind of did that in airplane form.

2059
02:42:44,525 --> 02:42:51,669
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I mean, you just spawn in everybody, depending on what army you're with, you pick a side, you fight it out, and sooner or later somebody wins the battle, and that's it.

2060
02:42:51,949 --> 02:42:52,649
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of cool.

2061
02:42:52,809 --> 02:42:56,851
[SPEAKER_05]: Gosh, I don't remember the last time I seriously played an airplane combat game like that.

2062
02:42:57,111 --> 02:43:03,634
[SPEAKER_05]: It was probably Top Gun on the NES, and you go into that intense rage when you can't refuel your damn plane.

2063
02:43:05,335 --> 02:43:06,576
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah, most definitely.

2064
02:43:06,817 --> 02:43:12,201
[SPEAKER_09]: And since this one's free on Steam, it's bound to be picking up tons of people, especially with this next expansion when they add tanks.

2065
02:43:12,221 --> 02:43:16,284
[SPEAKER_09]: They just teased it over in one of the Russian cons, so it looks quite good.

2066
02:43:17,325 --> 02:43:18,486
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm all about free.

2067
02:43:18,626 --> 02:43:21,488
[SPEAKER_05]: Steam is really developing a nice little free library on there.

2068
02:43:21,528 --> 02:43:22,168
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pretty cool.

2069
02:43:23,189 --> 02:43:25,830
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's going to be the neat thing when they get that Steam machine out there.

2070
02:43:25,850 --> 02:43:32,813
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be a huge marketing thing for them is that, hey, all you have to do is buy the system and you can get all these games for free because they're all free.

2071
02:43:33,253 --> 02:43:35,154
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's a great way to market stuff.

2072
02:43:35,915 --> 02:43:37,976
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's what I've been up to, man.

2073
02:43:37,996 --> 02:43:38,736
[SPEAKER_09]: Y'all take it easy.

2074
02:43:38,816 --> 02:43:39,336
[SPEAKER_09]: Excellent show.

2075
02:43:39,496 --> 02:43:39,776
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2076
02:43:39,856 --> 02:43:41,237
[SPEAKER_05]: It's awesome to hear from you as always.

2077
02:43:41,277 --> 02:43:41,617
[SPEAKER_05]: Take care.

2078
02:43:41,637 --> 02:43:42,578
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2079
02:43:42,598 --> 02:43:42,678
[SPEAKER_05]: Bye.

2080
02:43:44,159 --> 02:43:46,161
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2081
02:44:08,863 --> 02:44:14,745
[SPEAKER_05]: Nevermind, but I will get to tweets and last minute stories here in a minute First, let me go to the phones Hi, you're on Orange Silence Radio, who's this?

2082
02:44:15,426 --> 02:44:27,010
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, it's Ranma Hey buddy, you got beat tonight Well, that's because I'm still dealing with stuff from New York Comic Con, so... Excuses, excuses Alright, well tell us about the con already, how was it?

2083
02:44:28,210 --> 02:44:34,733
[SPEAKER_04]: It was pretty good, I have to admit for a Saturday It wasn't as crowded as I thought it was Really?

2084
02:44:35,600 --> 02:44:42,866
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah Is that because everybody was so pissed off that their Twitters were tweeting things that they weren't intending on saying about the show?

2085
02:44:43,566 --> 02:45:00,619
[SPEAKER_04]: I just, I heard about this I want you to know, when you register your badge, you can opt out of that And we all know, not everybody reads the fine print You fill out the form, you spin down to the end that you accept and you acknowledge Add this, add that, done

2086
02:45:01,019 --> 02:45:01,860
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you guys hear about this?

2087
02:45:01,940 --> 02:45:02,561
[SPEAKER_05]: What happened?

2088
02:45:03,001 --> 02:45:09,648
[SPEAKER_05]: The people that were registering for New York Comic Con, I don't know why, but they were tying their Twitter accounts or something to the registration.

2089
02:45:10,048 --> 02:45:18,136
[SPEAKER_05]: And when the smartphones picked up that these guys were at the convention, it would automatically tweet, I'm having a great time in New York Comic Con.

2090
02:45:18,176 --> 02:45:18,777
[SPEAKER_05]: And people were pissed.

2091
02:45:19,998 --> 02:45:40,881
[SPEAKER_05]: that this thing was tweeting for well it's stupid they shut it down in like 12 hours that's that intrusive advertising we were talking about earlier not smart so anyway sorry now that we got the little dark cloud around Comic Con out of the way tell us more about the good stuff not to mention the other dark cloud around Comic Con

2092
02:45:41,656 --> 02:45:42,036
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

2093
02:46:11,295 --> 02:46:16,118
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, but for real, tell us some good news out of New York Comic Con, for heaven's sake.

2094
02:46:19,300 --> 02:46:21,421
[SPEAKER_04]: The re-release of Ranma 1F on Blu-ray.

2095
02:46:22,381 --> 02:46:23,122
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that sounds nice.

2096
02:46:23,902 --> 02:46:24,643
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

2097
02:46:26,404 --> 02:46:34,648
[SPEAKER_04]: I was asked to be a part of a retrospective that Viz is putting out, and we got a chance to see some screenshots between a DVD and a Blu-ray.

2098
02:46:35,048 --> 02:46:36,089
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks beautiful.

2099
02:46:37,050 --> 02:46:39,411
[SPEAKER_04]: And for Ook-chan's sake...

2100
02:46:40,421 --> 02:46:42,924
[SPEAKER_04]: They're re-subbing the episodes.

2101
02:46:43,305 --> 02:46:45,368
[SPEAKER_01]: Ooh, happy.

2102
02:46:46,269 --> 02:46:46,489
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

2103
02:46:47,410 --> 02:46:47,591
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

2104
02:46:47,811 --> 02:46:49,013
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope they're more accurate.

2105
02:46:49,834 --> 02:46:51,496
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, you're going to shed a tear when you watch this.

2106
02:46:52,077 --> 02:46:53,499
[SPEAKER_01]: Yay, I need this then.

2107
02:46:53,539 --> 02:46:54,660
[SPEAKER_01]: This has to be a part of my life.

2108
02:46:54,820 --> 02:46:57,784
[SPEAKER_05]: So were they actually showing this at Comic-Con, the new Blu-ray?

2109
02:46:59,332 --> 02:47:07,118
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they actually showed it on, I think, Thursday or Friday, because I only had a one-day badge, and everyone was talking about how much they saw it, and I'm like, I hate you guys.

2110
02:47:07,758 --> 02:47:14,563
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice, and you know, your name is DJ Ranma S, so you have a slight passing interest in things related to this series, right?

2111
02:47:15,023 --> 02:47:15,904
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, pretty much.

2112
02:47:18,449 --> 02:47:26,753
[SPEAKER_04]: I think one of the reasons why it wasn't as crowded Saturday is because in order for you to get into the con, you had to check in.

2113
02:47:27,013 --> 02:47:31,856
[SPEAKER_04]: The check-in areas were outside in the parking lot areas in front of the convention center.

2114
02:47:32,016 --> 02:47:40,000
[SPEAKER_04]: Because when I walked in, they finally incorporated the queue room type setup for everybody to go into.

2115
02:47:40,720 --> 02:47:43,922
[SPEAKER_04]: And from that, it just kind of flowed like water.

2116
02:47:48,550 --> 02:47:52,655
[SPEAKER_05]: What is the secret to not getting a backed up as hell line at your convention?

2117
02:47:52,695 --> 02:47:53,876
[SPEAKER_05]: You've been to enough conventions.

2118
02:47:54,937 --> 02:48:07,831
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that would be it, the queue line, because when it comes to cons, people will say, they will say on the site, pre-regs at this time, people will show up at one to two hours prior to

2119
02:48:08,683 --> 02:48:09,623
[SPEAKER_04]: Just to get their badge.

2120
02:48:10,024 --> 02:48:11,424
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially for Otakon.

2121
02:48:12,125 --> 02:48:17,027
[SPEAKER_04]: Because during the summer in Baltimore, the temperature tends to hit triple digits.

2122
02:48:17,367 --> 02:48:21,369
[SPEAKER_04]: And I have seen people out there for three and four hours at a time.

2123
02:48:22,250 --> 02:48:23,551
[SPEAKER_04]: And pretty much in full costume.

2124
02:48:23,631 --> 02:48:24,891
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same way at AX.

2125
02:48:26,312 --> 02:48:32,135
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why this sort of thing started for a little bit of your registration line costume.

2126
02:48:34,470 --> 02:48:34,910
[SPEAKER_01]: No, for real.

2127
02:48:35,170 --> 02:48:44,894
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a variation of a costume or a character that you're doing that is more comfortable to wear in line but still is, you know, acceptable to wear out in the triple digits.

2128
02:48:45,902 --> 02:48:46,783
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, pretty much.

2129
02:48:47,463 --> 02:48:55,228
[SPEAKER_04]: Between you and me, I'd rather get to the hotel, relax for a few hours, then head on over, pick up my badge, and then go meet up with friends to eat.

2130
02:48:55,608 --> 02:48:56,308
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd rather do that.

2131
02:48:56,448 --> 02:49:00,111
[SPEAKER_01]: I like when AX started doing day before pre-reg.

2132
02:49:00,431 --> 02:49:08,676
[SPEAKER_01]: Where you could pick up your badges the day before the convention for everyone who pre-registered so that the lines were left for regular registration.

2133
02:49:10,137 --> 02:49:16,818
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, well, but what things what's happening now is even if you pre-reg and you pick up the day before, you think that would help?

2134
02:49:17,238 --> 02:49:22,699
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you still have people who show up the day of and are usually out there at 5 o'clock in the morning just to get a badge.

2135
02:49:23,059 --> 02:49:24,459
[SPEAKER_04]: Meanwhile, doors aren't open until 9.

2136
02:49:25,260 --> 02:49:33,201
[SPEAKER_01]: Word of advice, don't wear combat boots that are not adjusted to your feet in line for registration or masquerade.

2137
02:49:34,801 --> 02:49:37,902
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a meme I wrote about that I have to post on your wall.

2138
02:49:37,962 --> 02:49:38,802
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll appreciate it.

2139
02:49:39,463 --> 02:49:44,506
[SPEAKER_01]: Just remind me to tell you sometime about the days of my Jill Valentine costume.

2140
02:49:45,646 --> 02:49:46,047
[SPEAKER_04]: Will do.

2141
02:49:46,247 --> 02:49:48,208
[SPEAKER_01]: Playing DDR in combat boots is not fun.

2142
02:49:48,828 --> 02:49:49,108
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

2143
02:49:49,168 --> 02:49:50,569
[SPEAKER_04]: I beat that dress as Ranma.

2144
02:49:50,869 --> 02:49:53,171
[SPEAKER_04]: Those sandals, I will never do it again.

2145
02:49:54,171 --> 02:50:03,756
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry I got really quiet there, but I took a moment to go visit the news source that I should have been watching this whole time, Jamie's Tumblr, to read about what happened in New York Comic Con.

2146
02:50:04,397 --> 02:50:07,278
[SPEAKER_05]: My eyes just rolled so far in the back of my head I can see my brain.

2147
02:50:07,679 --> 02:50:07,919
[SPEAKER_05]: Like...

2148
02:50:10,366 --> 02:50:12,867
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm infuriated by it.

2149
02:50:13,028 --> 02:50:14,188
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just like, I can't.

2150
02:50:14,828 --> 02:50:15,269
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't.

2151
02:50:16,249 --> 02:50:17,050
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all I can say.

2152
02:50:17,110 --> 02:50:18,150
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just like, I can't believe.

2153
02:50:18,170 --> 02:50:21,032
[SPEAKER_01]: I still see how people can think that doing something like that is okay.

2154
02:50:21,132 --> 02:50:29,436
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's the thing is that somebody in a room somewhere said, and just if you guys don't know this cosplayer, again, I'm like totally reeling.

2155
02:50:29,696 --> 02:50:31,338
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to leave the bulk of the story for Ranma.

2156
02:50:31,378 --> 02:50:31,858
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, we will.

2157
02:50:32,239 --> 02:50:43,090
[SPEAKER_05]: This cosplayer that was at the convention was basically sexually harassed by this television crew that was trying to film her boobs and things like this.

2158
02:50:43,350 --> 02:50:44,492
[SPEAKER_05]: Just really stupid shit.

2159
02:50:44,872 --> 02:50:50,178
[SPEAKER_05]: But the thing that gets me is that I'm like, somebody sat in a room and said, this is a good idea.

2160
02:50:51,385 --> 02:50:53,446
[SPEAKER_01]: And for the record, this is why we still need feminism.

2161
02:50:53,506 --> 02:50:53,907
[SPEAKER_01]: Just saying.

2162
02:50:55,127 --> 02:50:57,028
[SPEAKER_05]: This is why we need common sense.

2163
02:50:58,309 --> 02:51:02,952
[SPEAKER_04]: And Rob, multiple reports came about that group right after this popped up.

2164
02:51:04,753 --> 02:51:07,495
[SPEAKER_01]: And now they're playing chicken saying, well, we're not ever going to go back again.

2165
02:51:07,955 --> 02:51:09,116
[SPEAKER_01]: They shouldn't exist.

2166
02:51:10,637 --> 02:51:11,157
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a little...

2167
02:51:12,630 --> 02:51:18,355
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, I will keep my mouth shut and let you have the say Tuesdays on Out of My Jam Session.

2168
02:51:18,415 --> 02:51:21,318
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to rant if I didn't have school on Tuesday.

2169
02:51:21,778 --> 02:51:23,119
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to call in and rant.

2170
02:51:23,139 --> 02:51:25,001
[SPEAKER_05]: You might need to do a pre-taped segment or something.

2171
02:51:25,642 --> 02:51:28,724
[SPEAKER_04]: You are more than welcome to write up an article for my site if you'd like.

2172
02:51:29,685 --> 02:51:30,105
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

2173
02:51:30,646 --> 02:51:31,046
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

2174
02:51:32,447 --> 02:51:39,514
[SPEAKER_04]: But let's get back on track here and I'll make this part brief and I'll get out of here because one thing I have noticed on Saturday is

2175
02:51:40,549 --> 02:51:41,390
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

2176
02:52:11,184 --> 02:52:22,756
[SPEAKER_05]: That's, I, again, I'm just, I mean, that doesn't make me sad in the same way the other thing made me sad, but it's just like, I just, I weep that Strider, no one cares.

2177
02:52:23,157 --> 02:52:24,959
[SPEAKER_05]: I really hope the sales don't reflect that.

2178
02:52:26,375 --> 02:52:26,915
[SPEAKER_04]: I doubt it.

2179
02:52:26,975 --> 02:52:33,421
[SPEAKER_04]: But also, everybody was going nuts at the Ubisoft display because they had Just Dance 2014 out.

2180
02:52:33,561 --> 02:52:37,044
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh boy.

2181
02:52:37,845 --> 02:52:44,771
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just noticed while I was recording footage of people dancing, they had some, I think a pinball, PC pinball gaming contest going on.

2182
02:52:45,211 --> 02:52:49,035
[SPEAKER_04]: This girl won and walked away with a high-end NVIDIA PC and I thought that was pretty cool.

2183
02:52:49,195 --> 02:52:49,515
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.

2184
02:52:50,516 --> 02:53:07,955
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's pretty cool, there's an ABBA song in Just Dance 2014, just saying alright, Ranma, we gotta we gotta let you go so we can wrap up the show, but tune in to Anime Jam Session Tuesday at 6.30 Pacific 9.30 Eastern, right after Electric Sisterhood here on VOG alright, take care buddy you too

2185
02:53:09,637 --> 02:53:10,739
[SPEAKER_05]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

2186
02:53:26,896 --> 02:53:51,921
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright then, let's get to the Twitters as soon as I can bring it up Alright, so Bobby linked us to this article that says Because we all love lists And it was literally a list of Game of Thrones characters as video game consoles Now, I don't watch Game of Thrones, so I kind of looked at the list going, doesn't make sense to me But it just seems like the type of thing that they're intentionally baiting people to share on Facebook

2187
02:53:53,061 --> 02:54:19,449
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is kind of what some of the internet's turned into And some of what Facebook's turned into And I don't know I want to talk about this tweet from Actdeft Because I heard about this too Actdeft tweets us saying I just learned about the existence of a 3DS version of Chocobo Racing And sadly it got canned I did forget they did announce this Like when the 3DS first came out They were like yeah we're going to make a Chocobo Racing game for it Well it came out this week that that game got cancelled

2188
02:54:20,626 --> 02:54:39,273
[SPEAKER_05]: and I'm like, aww I really like the PlayStation game I know it kind of got mixed reviews and some people didn't feel so hot on the game, but I thought the game was really cool so I'm sad they didn't do Chocobo Racing on 3DS, I would have enjoyed it but I guess I'll never get to play it sniff sniff

2189
02:54:40,831 --> 02:54:54,245
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see, Tigerclaw sends us a link here and I will read this here Russian government to fund patriotic games Interesting, I'm trying to look at this article because I haven't heard about this

2190
02:54:57,584 --> 02:55:10,613
[SPEAKER_05]: He links us to an article at GameSpot.com that says Russia's culture minister says video games have to be conducive to patriotic education and if you distort history you could be banned.

2191
02:55:11,534 --> 02:55:14,236
[SPEAKER_05]: It will help fund the production of patriotic games.

2192
02:55:15,957 --> 02:55:30,591
[SPEAKER_05]: and it's comments from the aid to Russia's culture minister Vladimir Mandinsky said in an interview with a Russian daily newspaper and there are several developers that they're in talks with for games to be released through 2014 you know

2193
02:55:32,953 --> 02:55:36,875
[SPEAKER_05]: This is interesting because you might think, oh, government-funded video games.

2194
02:55:36,995 --> 02:55:38,216
[SPEAKER_05]: What a crazy idea.

2195
02:55:38,676 --> 02:55:42,319
[SPEAKER_05]: Not really because weren't we just hearing on Bobby Blackwolf's show a couple weeks ago?

2196
02:55:42,379 --> 02:55:44,640
[SPEAKER_05]: He was out there at the CDC Game Jam.

2197
02:55:44,680 --> 02:55:46,161
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, CDC is a government arm.

2198
02:55:46,681 --> 02:55:49,943
[SPEAKER_05]: So obviously it wasn't necessarily funding patriotic games.

2199
02:55:50,003 --> 02:56:01,189
[SPEAKER_05]: It was funding awareness of – but I just thought it was interesting that there's patriotic games of a different sense being made here.

2200
02:56:03,331 --> 02:56:04,693
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see if there's any other tweets here.

2201
02:56:04,753 --> 02:56:07,956
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll read this very kind tweet from Sutur who says, Oh, thank you.

2202
02:56:13,737 --> 02:56:15,699
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2203
02:56:39,085 --> 02:56:42,510
[SPEAKER_05]: and I think that'll do it for tweets.

2204
02:56:42,590 --> 02:56:43,691
[SPEAKER_01]: We should have something.

2205
02:56:43,731 --> 02:56:48,137
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to start this on the Orange Lounge Tumblr called Show Us Your Pussy.

2206
02:56:50,280 --> 02:56:51,241
[SPEAKER_01]: I want pictures of cats.

2207
02:56:52,923 --> 02:56:54,665
[SPEAKER_05]: There's already a shit ton of those on Tumblr.

2208
02:56:55,406 --> 02:56:56,928
[SPEAKER_01]: My favorite is Get Out of There Cat.

2209
02:56:58,123 --> 02:56:58,403
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2210
02:56:59,184 --> 02:57:00,105
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it for Twitter topics.

2211
02:57:00,385 --> 02:57:02,627
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's going to do it for our show tonight.

2212
02:57:02,647 --> 02:57:03,988
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to wrap on up here.

2213
02:57:04,769 --> 02:57:07,611
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to thank you guys for staying up with us late and listening to the show.

2214
02:57:08,252 --> 02:57:13,116
[SPEAKER_05]: And remember, if you like what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio, we don't make any money off this show.

2215
02:57:13,236 --> 02:57:15,938
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't ask for your money really to do this at all.

2216
02:57:16,939 --> 02:57:18,761
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe once in a while a charity drive or something.

2217
02:57:18,781 --> 02:57:20,102
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't pocket any money from the show.

2218
02:57:20,342 --> 02:57:20,922
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2219
02:57:44,102 --> 02:57:47,664
[SPEAKER_05]: If you did make it this far in the show, then hopefully you did really like what you hear.

2220
02:57:48,425 --> 02:57:50,086
[SPEAKER_05]: The nominations are about to close.

2221
02:57:50,146 --> 02:57:54,749
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we've got like two more days left for the 7th Annual Podcast Awards.

2222
02:57:55,049 --> 02:58:04,795
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you're listening live right now and you haven't done it yet, please consider going to PodcastAwards.com and nominating Orange Lens Radio for People's Choice and Best Gaming.

2223
02:58:04,855 --> 02:58:07,337
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you don't know what to put for the URL, just put OrangeLensRadio.com.

2224
02:58:08,137 --> 02:58:09,038
[SPEAKER_05]: They'll figure it out.

2225
02:58:09,058 --> 02:58:09,998
[SPEAKER_05]: We've been nominated before.

2226
02:58:10,038 --> 02:58:11,559
[SPEAKER_05]: They know who we are.

2227
02:58:12,159 --> 02:58:15,221
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, it really helps us spread awareness.

2228
02:58:15,261 --> 02:58:17,942
[SPEAKER_05]: That whole thing I just talked about before, you know, getting the word of mouth out there.

2229
02:58:18,422 --> 02:58:20,063
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, would really appreciate it.

2230
02:58:20,263 --> 02:58:22,564
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you decide to nominate somebody else, that's cool too.

2231
02:58:22,865 --> 02:58:23,705
[SPEAKER_05]: Just keep it independent.

2232
02:58:23,865 --> 02:58:24,405
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all we ask.

2233
02:58:24,445 --> 02:58:25,106
[SPEAKER_05]: Keep it independent.

2234
02:58:25,366 --> 02:58:26,927
[SPEAKER_05]: Independents are the ones that need the exposure.

2235
02:58:27,407 --> 02:58:28,968
[SPEAKER_05]: So good luck to everybody.

2236
02:58:30,789 --> 02:58:31,129
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

2237
02:58:31,270 --> 02:58:35,013
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess we'll go around and get everybody's final thought for the night and then wrap up and get out of here.

2238
02:58:35,694 --> 02:58:38,116
[SPEAKER_05]: I will give my final thought first tonight.

2239
02:58:38,176 --> 02:58:42,781
[SPEAKER_05]: And my final thought is I'm going to try very hard the rest of this evening to not talk.

2240
02:58:43,521 --> 02:58:48,466
[SPEAKER_05]: But doing this show makes me happy and I'm glad I could push through these past few hours to be here with you tonight.

2241
02:58:49,587 --> 02:58:50,648
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, your final thought tonight.

2242
02:58:51,254 --> 02:58:53,075
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to play lots of Grand Theft Auto 5 this week.

2243
02:58:53,336 --> 02:59:01,421
[SPEAKER_02]: And stay tuned to the forums because we'll have an exact time and day for those VOG gaming nights for Grand Theft Auto Online.

2244
02:59:01,702 --> 02:59:04,023
[SPEAKER_02]: It might be in the middle of the week now.

2245
02:59:04,684 --> 02:59:05,184
[SPEAKER_02]: But we'll see.

2246
02:59:05,945 --> 02:59:06,245
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

2247
02:59:06,825 --> 02:59:07,626
[SPEAKER_05]: You've got to figure that out.

2248
02:59:07,886 --> 02:59:10,128
[SPEAKER_05]: And last but not least, DarkSakura, your final thought.

2249
02:59:10,948 --> 02:59:11,709
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm very grumpy.

2250
02:59:13,246 --> 02:59:13,867
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry to hear it.

2251
02:59:14,587 --> 02:59:16,389
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, that's it guys.

2252
02:59:16,449 --> 02:59:18,130
[SPEAKER_05]: We're done here at Orange Lounge Radio.

2253
02:59:18,190 --> 02:59:20,612
[SPEAKER_05]: We will be back next week to do it all again.

2254
02:59:21,173 --> 02:59:25,456
[SPEAKER_05]: Have a wonderful week in the meantime and keep on gaming and have fun.

2255
