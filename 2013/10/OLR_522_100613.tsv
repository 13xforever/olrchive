14164	15646	All this and more begins right now.
31331	32211	DarkSakura or Jamie Summers
61740	62301	No, it's not on.
62381	62841	Now it's on.
62881	64042	Did I do my math right?
64983	65884	I don't care.
68026	68867	Math sucks.
69247	70248	Why are you meh?
70328	71309	Sunday is fun day.
71789	75632	Because I'm waiting for Halloween to be over so I can buy Purim costumes.
76933	77414	Fair enough.
78792	83674	and then get all the candy on sale and then make candy corn muffins or something.
84514	90976	Actually, I am planning, even though I'm not doing sugar very much, I'm planning on making candy corn vodka.
91116	91676	Hooray!
92497	93437	Vodka doesn't count.
95373	95833	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
124867	128149	and then Candy Corn and it's like Candy Corn Oreos and like all this.
128549	134252	This is the time of year that I actually make my I kind of call it gourd soup.
135072	138634	But I make a butternut squash, pumpkin and sweet potato soup.
139635	140095	Yummy.
140595	141956	And it's really creamy.
142036	144397	But now the way that I make these is I make them all savory.
144497	150400	So I put like garlic and rosemary and all kinds of savory herbs in it so that it's sweet and savory at the same time.
150580	152601	And you guys, she's going to bring some to the next show.
152701	153041	Yay!
153081	154101	Maybe I will.
154261	156222	I've actually got the stuff to make my soup.
156842	162023	And this time I have purple mountain yams to add in it this time.
162603	163504	This sounds delicious.
163604	164164	I can't wait.
164364	165484	All the listeners are hungry now.
165644	170966	But everybody should be jealous of my amazing dinner because I had rabbit and beef liver for dinner.
170986	172066	Poor Bugs Bunny.
172586	173506	Too Much Fucking Pumpkin, Yo
193573	197315	Well, even our chatters have wrong opinions sometimes here at Orange Lounge Radio.
197575	200156	But after all, it is the show where every gamer has a voice.
200256	200976	I don't like pumpkin.
201076	202677	And there he is, Tech Master Loki.
202777	203698	What's wrong with you?
204098	204818	I don't like pumpkin.
204858	205939	You don't like pumpkin?
206079	206239	No.
206559	206819	All right.
206859	209680	Well, some people think I'm weird because I don't like mayonnaise.
209760	210921	I don't think I introduced myself.
211001	212001	I'm Rob Roberts, by the way.
212081	213942	If you don't know me, I'm Rob Roberts, and I hate mayonnaise.
213962	217764	I can understand eating straight up mayonnaise, but on a sandwich is fine.
218184	218984	As long as it's not cooked.
219004	219505	Or tuna salad.
219785	220045	Mm-mm.
220505	223289	or Chicken Salad or everything with mayonnaise.
223430	231882	Last night, Alan and I went and got sushi and we got this one roll and I was kind of like, I think that's a mayo-based sauce and I'm going to have to kind of like eat the edges.
232685	233025	You know what?
233085	238531	I got sushi the other day and I had an allergic reaction to it because you know what was mixed in with the crab?
238691	238951	What?
238991	239492	Sriracha.
240473	240913	Oh no.
241093	242215	Sriracha crab?
242275	242635	That's weird.
242715	244297	It was how they made their spicy crab.
245137	253946	They mixed sriracha in with the crab and normally I'm fine with spicy crab because it's just like maybe a little, you know, something else hot but they mixed sriracha in it which I'm like stupidly allergic to.
254767	256569	So I actually still have a hive and it hurts.
257969	258310	Let's see.
258350	261471	Going to Ragenator in our chatroom says pumpkin flavored mayonnaise.
261911	262351	I'm sorry.
262391	263212	That won't work for me.
263412	265012	Just like it probably won't work for Loki.
266593	267433	That's not okay.
268434	268994	Well, here's the thing.
269034	273816	I don't understand putting mayonnaise on hot things.
273876	274876	With a sandwich, it's okay.
275096	281619	But people put it on burgers or they'll get a sandwich at a sandwich place and they're like, yeah, I'd like that toasted.
282019	283280	It's like, okay, cool.
283360	284360	Now it's like this nasty.
285121	304337	I am literally gagging right now and I don't mean like fashion runway I'm gagging at that I mean like I am actually about to barf when you're talking about that I won't tell you about what my mom used to eat as a snack no canned pears with mayonnaise and cheese I actually grew up on that it's pretty good all right look we need to talk about video games
304602	307543	What about a mayonnaise-flavored flurry or something like that?
308124	308704	What's wrong with you people?
308724	311465	I like homemade mayonnaise as a garnish on dishes.
311585	316127	Look, be nice to everybody and respectful, because we've got a guest here in studio tonight.
316547	318108	I bet she likes mayonnaise.
318148	318548	She might.
318948	320289	We're going to say hello to our guest here.
320509	326612	It's actually her second time on the show, but welcome back, as the case may be, to Shell is here tonight.
327112	328133	Thank you very much for having me
356949	358529	I think this happened after you were on the show.
358549	358930	Have you seen it?
358950	360430	It's on Wii U Virtual Console now.
360950	361911	No, I did not.
362111	365293	I could get that puppy over here right now for you to check out.
365353	366333	It's awesome.
366573	367294	That would be awesome.
367474	369515	I need to play more of it, to be honest.
369835	371415	Have you checked out anything lately?
371456	376498	I know we're going to get into gaming weeks a little later, but what kind of stuff have you been into in general as of late?
377169	383193	You know, since I've been busy, I've been getting my nostalgia on with old LucasArts stuff and a lot of free RPG stuff.
383313	383653	Fair enough.
383853	394119	Yeah, you know, you people light up my life with your independent RPGs that are fan-made stuff, but at the same time, guys, sometimes you need to work on your programming.
394320	400944	Because, you know, I want to meet you halfway, but when I noclip into a shelf, yeah...
401644	403185	There's such good stuff out there, though.
403246	410512	Like, there are a lot of great indie RPGs, and the great thing about RPGs is that they're a great time, they take forever to beat, usually, so they're a great time scene.
410772	413074	And I'm thinking of things like, you know, Cthulhu Saves the World.
413335	414415	Have you played any of that stuff?
414676	414936	No.
414956	415296	Adorbs.
416257	416758	Adorbs.
416938	418499	Do you have, are you a Steam user?
419160	420361	Not really so much, no.
420421	423083	My computer's broke as hell, and it's also four years old.
423544	426146	It's doing some interesting breakage right now, in fact.
427678	430340	If you're able to put some band-aids on it, check out Steam.
430540	432501	Some of these indie RPGs are like $1.50.
433021	436042	They go on sale.
436182	440344	There'll be a winter sale, as there always is, going into New Year's and such this year.
440364	444106	It'll be like, hand us a couple quarters and here's like 50 games.
444306	445508	Sales all the things.
445608	446329	Exactly.
446770	447290	Exactly.
447370	451857	Don't forget there's something we're bringing up in Part B for people who are not on Steam.
451977	452437	Absolutely.
452457	453118	A little teaser.
453138	454040	A little teaser.
454701	457625	So Chell will have to pay attention in Part B. There will be a quiz tonight.
457665	458506	I don't know if they told you.
458966	459748	There will be a quiz.
460008	461330	What other stuff do you do for fun, Chell?
462288	463549	I haven't been doing much fun lately.
464149	476114	I've mostly been working on just getting stuff for my degree together and working on a lot of learning 3D stuff because one day I hope to join the unwashed masses and start churning out games like I want to play.
476494	476954	Awesome.
477535	480536	Have you thought about what would be your dream company to work for?
481431	484233	Rob doesn't usually ask stupid questions, haha, or at least I had to tell myself, but that one was pretty dumb.
484253	488437	It's not just that they make games that I want to play, it's that they seem like a really chill workforce.
501047	504790	Have you seen that leaked handbook that's online?
504810	508433	That's like the Valve company handbook, like what the employees get.
508853	513297	You know, their corporate culture is so interesting at Valve.
513997	514878	It's just so neat.
515018	521363	And I kind of think about, gosh, if they try to do something like that at my day job, I don't know if something like that would fly.
521443	525387	Some industries need structure, but it's so interesting as Valve has really pulled off this
526147	527228	Everybody's equal.
527589	528630	We don't have titles.
529010	534276	Your desk is on wheels, and you roll it where you need to go, and we don't tell you what to do.
534396	535978	You find projects.
537380	540043	You guys have to Google this if you've never seen this before, the Valve handbook.
540503	544407	Technically, I don't know if it's legit or not, but it seems like it would be.
544848	545909	I have no reason to doubt it.
546069	547130	Sounds pretty close, yeah.
547911	556599	And it's just like so interesting that, you know, a person might start work at this company and they don't have any assignments.
556619	558761	So they just have to go like find something to do.
559322	561063	But that's the type of people they're looking for.
561284	562145	Yeah, work raising.
562425	563085	Yeah, so...
563926	564306	All right.
564406	568209	Well, unfortunately, as we're broadcasting live here, we're having a little bit of stream troubles.
568589	574232	I'm going to keep going for the sake of the podcast, but for some reason, we're not actually able to reconnect.
574493	582237	And what's going on is actually on server room side because we are not able to reconnect at all.
582778	587500	So I'm going to try to keep this show going while doing tech at the same time.
589442	589882	All right.
590922	592543	I... Well, you know what?
593163	596724	We could go and bring up our next topic.
597144	597584	We could.
598005	607148	Or I have another idea, too, is that since this is for the sake of the podcast, why don't we do a quick musical interlude while we try to fix things, and then we'll be right back.
607208	607748	I could sing.
608088	608428	All right.
608688	609428	You want to sing us out?
609909	611709	Fly me to the moon.
611869	612009	No.
614150	619572	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase dash.
620194	621194	Alright, we're back.
621274	631619	That wasn't awkward or anything, but the joys of doing live radio is that sometimes the feed just, the internets go down, there's a server reboot or something happens.
632359	633320	The tubes untube.
633760	635801	The tubes get untied or I don't know what happens.
635821	636961	Or it's just being a butthole.
637201	639062	Or a cat just pulled out the plug.
639142	641323	Let's be real, that's probably what happened.
641363	644024	But for once, that wasn't our fault, at least I can say.
644484	645425	So, alright.
646585	647826	Where were we when we left off?
648047	652931	I was talking to the lovely Chelle over there about the dream company she wanted to work for.
653031	658436	We were talking about Valve and just kind of what a different type of company Valve is.
658857	659938	So let me ask you this.
660038	668426	Knowing that the employees at Valve can work on whatever project they want, if you were to get hired by Valve, hypothetically, what would be your dream project?
669677	671159	Uh, Barring Half-Life Part 3.
673201	674262	Which may or may not be a thing.
674322	675263	Make sure that mic's on, by the way.
675363	676304	Oh, yeah.
676545	676945	Sibilance.
677145	677506	Sibilance.
677526	677926	That's right.
678707	679988	So, Barring Half-Life Part 3.
681370	683292	Ooh, ooh, ooh, that is a tough one.
683933	691141	Yeah, you know, I really always wanted to, you know, obviously see a Portal sequel, but I just want to work on something just really new and fresh coming down the pipe that...
692021	694784	They kind of hit me where I live, story-wise.
694844	700729	Everything they put out is just right along the lines of what I try to bring into my fiction.
701109	707715	The continuing themes of being alone in a strange place and having to survive through strange circumstances.
708844	711125	You are a little quiet, by the way, so just make sure you tap right in that mic.
711165	712285	No, that's okay.
712425	718746	So you would hope to work on Half-Life 3 or something kind of new, because I'm a little fancy.
719127	723648	Speaking of new and fancy, Valve did make a bunch of announcements last week about this Steam box.
723988	725168	Have you been following this news at all?
725248	728389	No, I'm completely out of the loop during the school year.
729449	731171	That's why we're here, to help you stay current.
731752	737257	The Steam Box, they announced, is it's going to have its own operating system, SteamOS, which you can put on any computer.
737538	738859	It's basically a version of Linux.
739540	748389	And then they're going to be selling these computers that are basically... It's kind of to rival consoles a little bit, to bring PC gaming closer to the living room, but there'll be all these different types.
748409	749871	There's no way there are going to be console prices.
750191	751332	Loki's shaking his head over there.
751372	752033	No way, huh?
752261	752781	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
771653	772053	Like that.
772073	772574	Seriously.
772654	776036	Even the low end was like a, I think like a 680, you know.
776136	778998	I was like, that's still way better than I've got now.
779198	779498	Nice.
780258	783060	And WhatUpG says, how about that new controller for the Steam box?
783100	787783	Yes, don't forget there is that little controller too with the fancy little, it's really kind of weird.
787843	789644	It's got like thumbsticks, but they're like touchpads.
789944	790745	And it's neat.
791325	792085	It's interesting.
792145	792646	It's different.
793006	794547	You know, it's not the same old, same old, so.
795287	798609	Anything with a million joysticks makes me want to hiss and run into a corner.
798830	802732	That's one of my main issues with... One of my continuing issues with Xbox.
802932	809396	Remember when Nintendo announced the Wii and they came out with that Wiimote and a lot of people were like, it's really simple.
809576	811257	And Nintendo was like, that's the point.
811618	815840	So many people are intimidated by all the buttons, like on an Xbox or a PlayStation controller.
816441	822565	The nice thing about the Wii controller is that, yes, there's some smaller buttons, but for a lot of people, there's just one big giant button
823545	825246	That says A, and then the little trigger thing.
825266	827848	And that's why so many senior citizens do the bowling and all that, you know?
827888	831690	You think they learned from the clusterfuck that was the N64 controller?
832110	834291	Which was a good controller, but still.
834331	835552	Yes, exactly.
835952	840815	It gives me horrible, horrible flashbacks to Rebel Alliance N64.
840975	846058	My brother having me help hold down all the buttons so he can just... Oh, God.
846998	847378	All right.
847418	850820	Well, Chow, we'll be talking to you about the news and such throughout the show.
850880	854861	Please feel free to chime in as you like to have your say on whatever's going on.
855282	859383	And those of you in chat room, same thing for you guys, live.vognetwork.com.
859804	862765	And Actdeft says, Loki, that's only for the prototypes.
863825	867727	Actdeft says, the retail version of the Steam Machine will probably offer lower specs.
868058	869139	I want the world, I want the whole world
883559	883779	All right.
884861	891309	I want to do a quick kickoff topic here, and we are running a little behind because of the live stuff, so I'll just quickly talk about tonight's... I know, right?
891690	893112	We're only ever here for like four hours.
894513	901162	This is going to be a big week in gaming, whether Loki wants to admit it or not, because Saturday, October 12th, sees the release of...
901943	904765	Pokemon X and Y!
905886	907347	You're not a Pokemon fan.
907547	907788	No.
907968	908668	Why not?
909209	913832	Because I have other things to like, like free time.
914853	916654	I see, I see, I see.
916694	922599	So you value your time so much that you don't want to get sucked into Pokemon because you see how Pokemon ruins lives.
923041	924002	Yeah, thanks, Shane.
926203	932586	No, the last one I played was Pearl, and I only ever played it at the gym, which was ironic because I was going to gyms.
933046	933687	At the gym!
937620	940844	I don't know why that's so funny, but I'm laughing.
940904	942085	You're a dog I hear like Jim.
943587	946671	So here's a Pokemon, Jim, so you can go to the gym at your gym.
948033	952859	It would be funny because if I were a dude, I could be Jim because I'm Jamie.
953900	954280	Ha ha.
955021	955943	Oh my god, stop.
958106	960088	So... Rob's red.
960149	960389	It's awesome.
960409	961130	So you just skipped?
961470	964034	This is like one of those nights where just anything's funny.
964134	964595	I'm sorry.
964955	968100	Because there's probably people out there listening going, Rob, it wasn't that funny.
968400	969862	Rob, it's not that funny.
970643	971024	Loki's
971945	972665	All right, hater.
973426	975787	Why are you hating on the Pokemon?
976188	977248	It's not a series I'm into.
977508	982012	And don't get me wrong, I understand that there are fans of it, and I'm not saying there's anything wrong with those fans.
982352	989677	I was just thinking, you know, that's probably why they have Shane working at a certain company, because he is the crack dealer for getting people into any game.
990398	1007417	and you know they have him behind you know Pokemon well I've said this on Horde House is that Shane was born to do sales and I'd like that's that's where his ultimate calling is going to end up being someday but this is stop making this the Shane show I'm sure he's listening very happy that we're talking Pokemon and all this but
1007785	1008945	No, I don't understand it.
1008985	1012826	And honestly, to me, this looks like the way I look at a Madden release.
1012886	1014267	It's like, oh, cool.
1014607	1018528	Instead of colors this time, it's X and Y. Cool.
1019148	1023609	And that means nothing to me other than I assume that there's just going to be a few more Pokemon.
1025209	1032451	And you have to collect those to add to your ever-large collection of Pokemon that you battle each other for whatever reason.
1032531	1033131	I don't understand.
1034538	1042385	If you are moving in that direction, I'm kind of disappointed that there is an opportunity to go in the other chromosomes so you get Pokemons with some autosomal disorders.
1043046	1047970	You've got the Down Syndrome Pokemon that you have to help a little out, but he's punching for you.
1048030	1049171	Yeah, he's pulling for you.
1049511	1051893	That would have taken gaming into a whole new area.
1053074	1054436	What about Aspie Pokemon?
1054636	1054896	Yeah.
1055657	1059260	Where they take everything really literal and then, yeah.
1061207	1082132	and I'm allowed to say that so I'm looking at our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com and Actdeft says Jim at the gym Jimception alright need to go down another level let's see Blackwolf says Loki's not into Pokemon because it's not Grand Theft Auto
1083400	1089963	Well, to be fair, we had a discussion last week where Jamie's like, I'm not that into Grand Theft Auto, and now this week it's, I'm not that into Pokemon.
1089983	1101789	And to be fair, like, if they had some sort of mini-game in Grand Theft Auto where you had to, like, raise dogs and fight them or something, you know, the Michael Vick of, you know, the Pokemon, you know, world, I still probably wouldn't play that because that sounds stupid.
1101849	1111353	It's just, I don't know, I just don't, I'm not into that type of game where you, especially if it has to do with raising stuff, I mean, and I blame Nintendogs for that because fuck that, that made...
1111873	1114934	Any sort of raising of anything is extremely boring.
1114974	1116534	Hey, cute puppies, what's wrong with that?
1116914	1119455	Oh, everything, because have you raised a dog before?
1120235	1124236	It's not all petting and playing Frisbee and stuff.
1124256	1126256	You have to fucking feed that shit, wash it.
1126316	1128316	You're going to be cleaning poop all day.
1128356	1130797	They just want attention all goddamn hours of the day.
1130857	1135678	Come to think of it, right after I quit WoW was after the whole Pokemon mode came out.
1136318	1138739	So maybe that has something to do with it, too.
1139960	1142360	To Loki's thing, they put Pokemon in WoW.
1142501	1142841	That did happen.
1142881	1143621	And I quit.
1146042	1147903	I thought we all quit because of LFR.
1148003	1149283	That was the real reason, anyway.
1150764	1152565	I liked LFR, to be honest.
1153285	1163449	Just because I could just pew-pew stuff, and as long as I didn't fuck up, which I never fucked up, I'd get pissed off at other people fucking up, but then it gave me an excuse to be mad at somebody else.
1164642	1165743	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1182683	1201347	that you have to like and like only the ones you send into the fight actually get XP and it's like oh my gosh I gotta grind this and grind this and it's like the OCD gamer in me and like Shane has tried to tell me this like why are you leveling up all your Pokemon you only need like three of them to be really good to go somewhere and I'm like you don't understand how I play RPGs
1202293	1203834	No, yeah, I totally get that.
1203894	1207316	It sets off my OCD like, whoa, it's like 100% completion, bitches.
1207496	1208517	And it's in the lyrics.
1208757	1210938	I want to be the very best.
1211778	1212559	First sentence.
1213139	1218802	Yeah, that re-release of the first three games when you've got all the new areas and you've got the three new islands.
1218882	1221184	I thought it was never going to crawl out of my room.
1221664	1224966	I was going to crawl out of it to die, basically, and not for water or food or anything.
1225845	1234028	So here's why I'm really excited about X and Y is that apparently they're going to have this experience sharing so that now you can actually level everything that's in your party at once.
1234148	1237048	Thank you, based Pokemon.
1237409	1238349	I am so excited.
1239009	1241010	So we'll see.
1241330	1243870	No putting Magikarp into battle first and hoping like hell.
1246351	1250452	But you got to admit, once you got Gyarados, everyone was fucked.
1252614	1253175	It was worth it.
1253775	1254456	So worth it.
1254796	1259400	And I have to say that Pokemon has offered me comfort over the years.
1260060	1262182	My Charmander pillow was my AX pillow.
1262962	1266205	And my Togepi was my present after I got held up at gunpoint.
1266545	1267106	Oh my gosh.
1268359	1268819	That's scary.
1268839	1269579	You know that happened.
1269639	1270119	Yeah, no, I know.
1270139	1275580	When you were working at the... I found $10 in the parking lot and Dan gave me another $10 and I bought a Togepi.
1276281	1277861	And I still have my Togepi.
1278981	1279661	I love Togepi.
1279701	1280301	So cute.
1280942	1281262	All right.
1281322	1282302	So, yeah.
1282882	1283382	Okay.
1283502	1288063	So it sounds to me like there's half going to get it and half not going to get Pokemon.
1288743	1289223	So we'll see.
1289263	1289563	All right.
1290143	1291624	We will be checking with listeners later.
1292024	1293924	Pokemon is like STDs.
1293964	1295084	You don't got to catch them all.
1296485	1297005	Stop.
1297645	1298005	Stop.
1298565	1298865	All right.
1299606	1304568	And of course, there's the mandatory Actdeft in chat says, how about them mudkips?
1305268	1305608	Shut up.
1306089	1306629	All right.
1307049	1310171	Matt Cube says, it is popular because it is a simple RPG.
1310531	1314673	Well, you know, I don't want to spoil the Fugle question of the week because we're going to get into it a little later.
1314753	1319595	But I just will say in general, I'm hearing a lot of people that are really attached to Pokemon.
1319895	1325318	The reason behind it a lot of times is that we're from that certain generation where like we were like,
1325578	1325999	and DarkSakura.
1342779	1343639	They do catch diseases.
1343660	1344900	Pikachu has rabies.
1345721	1347822	You have to decapitate him to figure it out.
1348002	1351544	They get like burn and paralyze and all that.
1351944	1354786	Is it a sick burn?
1354866	1356306	Pikachu, you're lame.
1356426	1357087	Burn.
1357487	1358007	Oh no.
1358948	1359948	It was very effective.
1360809	1367913	Little minigame where they have burn outside of battle and you've got to swath them in gauze and take them to the hospital and they've got like five weeks of recovery.
1368633	1374235	And then like Nurse Joy won't let you have them because you have to be evaluated for Pokemon crudely.
1374535	1376136	Nurse Joy is my favorite.
1376776	1381538	She's my absolute favorite character next to Jigglypuff in the whole thing is Nurse Joy.
1381558	1381598	Ew.
1381618	1386500	You know, they had like I think a new mini series of Pokemon that they're putting out.
1386700	1387220	Yeah, they are.
1387240	1388661	Somebody was just asking me in chat about it too.
1388681	1388981	Oh my God.
1390069	1390770	I have to talk about this.
1391070	1400076	Did you see that gif that's going around on Tumblr of like a squirtle beating the shit out of a Charmander and Red's like there with his mouth open like, holy shit!
1400476	1402517	I mean beating the shit out of him.
1402858	1404118	He's like, no, come back.
1404639	1408461	Literally forcing his fist into his ass and shit is popping out.
1408481	1409742	God, why are you being nasty?
1409822	1410883	No, it's a gif.
1411183	1416206	I'll have to find it on Tumblr but it's like seriously just like going full on ballistic.
1416287	1416867	It's hilarious.
1416887	1419969	Finding a gif on Tumblr, man, that's like a needle in a haystack right there.
1420137	1420265	HAHA
1422265	1425006	Alpha Cananogram says, are you going to watch Pokemon Origins?
1425106	1425646	I want to.
1425746	1427307	It's supposedly really short.
1427347	1429088	Yeah, that gif is from Pokemon Origins.
1429888	1430148	All right.
1430908	1432169	Okay, we've got to move on with the show.
1432789	1434210	We've got to get into gaming week still.
1434670	1436290	We'll talk more Pokemons later.
1437011	1441192	But I think I made my decision, I will say, as far as Pokemon goes.
1441292	1443773	I'm going to get... Hold on.
1444013	1444313	Shut up.
1444714	1449896	I'm going to get Pokemon Y. I've decided I'm going to get Pokemon Y. And...
1450996	1452697	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1481094	1495688	um Fractal is pretty much video gaming crack I've and thank you Rob for uh giving uh for gifting Bejeweled 2 to me because um you're welcome because I played the crap load of that but it's still more fun on my phone
1496384	1498627	Actdeft, I cannot look at videos on my iPad while I'm doing the show.
1498647	1498867	Sorry.
1517148	1518709	Take a picture of the sun, Steven.
1545825	1546566	All my heavens.
1548970	1551073	That is the most gruesome thing I've ever seen.
1554078	1555580	Those are... That was...
1556827	1559568	That scream was not okay.
1559788	1562108	A bite out of Charmander's neck.
1562788	1572370	The audio had to be even worse because that sounded like, I don't know, that was not okay, that high-pitched screaming.
1572630	1575951	That was a little too visually vague for me.
1577911	1580592	Actdeft, I want you to apologize to the listeners right now.
1581360	1583041	Poor Charmander.
1583081	1584401	That is a rabid Squirtle.
1585521	1586742	That Squirtle needs to be put down.
1586762	1589503	Oh my god, that sound was horrible.
1589723	1594344	Although it has settled the age-old debate of reptiles versus amphibians.
1594604	1597785	Because, you know, turtles and salamanders, natural enemies.
1600346	1605828	So, I played other games that didn't involve Squirtles biting the crap out of Charmanders.
1605868	1606208	And the, ah!
1611437	1613257	Actdeft says, sorry, I'm so sorry.
1614718	1615498	Good, good.
1615718	1616118	Mean it.
1618599	1621640	Next time Loki goes on to one of his rants, I'm just going to have that queued up.
1622440	1624600	Oh, I did buy something on sale on Steam.
1625301	1625721	Oh, what?
1626061	1627961	I bought Bioshock Infinite last night.
1628181	1631802	Oh, yeah, they've been having Uber sales this weekend.
1632222	1636083	And also, Half-Life 2 is like $3.
1636763	1638504	So I picked that up for PC.
1639404	1644868	so that, you know, I don't have to hurt my hand playing it on Xbox.
1646049	1653635	So, yeah, I've, I just, it's pretty much, oh, yeah, and of course, my crack, my animal crack, Animal Crossing.
1653675	1654236	Animal cracking.
1654816	1662262	Which, just to say, I'm actually considering busting out the GameCube again and playing my Dobutunomori.
1662982	1663342	Why not?
1663362	1665064	Because you can unlock the NES cartridges.
1665084	1665344	Yeah.
1665748	1666469	Well, yeah.
1666849	1670512	The one that I have, there were two versions that came out on GameCube.
1670992	1674174	There was Doubutsu no Mori Plus, which is the one I have.
1674334	1678077	Then we got a better one in America after that.
1678337	1680079	And so that one was re-released in Japan as E+.
1680839	1681800	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1698962	1699963	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1720177	1729681	and then Dan is all like starting to get on Fire Emblem but then he was back on GTA 5 so I'm like, are you gonna be done?
1730001	1734463	He's like, well wait until Blah Blah comes out and you're never gonna see the DS again.
1734503	1738084	I'm like, you watch and you're not touching the game because I'm playing Animal Crossing.
1739345	1746588	And I am still trying to get the stupid kitchen island but none of the islands ever have it so fuck the fucking fuckers.
1746628	1747388	But I have a tan now.
1747950	1751253	So, you have to go to the island to get your island.
1752634	1753334	To get a tan?
1753374	1755696	Yeah, to get my island.
1756137	1758639	There's too much this and a that in tonight's show.
1760400	1766085	But for anyone who wants to know how to keep your tan in the winter months, go visit the island in the morning.
1767266	1768286	And don't wear a hat.
1769988	1771569	Some of the hats actually block you from getting tans.
1771669	1772550	Is it real life?
1772650	1773711	Is it Animal Crossing?
1773931	1775372	I don't know anymore, people.
1775893	1777574	Hey, my character's cute.
1778024	1780405	Actdeft, you need to give me that.
1781425	1782586	You can get another one now.
1782646	1783526	Just give it to me.
1785107	1787048	Actdeft has a kitchen island and needs to give it to me.
1787068	1789669	Can't you visit his town and order it?
1789709	1790609	I'm plugging in right now.
1792410	1794571	Nice.
1794931	1797692	She took my DS charger off the table.
1800214	1801616	and going, I'm taking this.
1801836	1805640	This is mine now because there's an island for me to go steal from somebody else.
1805940	1807282	She's stealing from two people.
1807822	1808623	Nine tenths of the law.
1810025	1810726	Don't encourage her.
1811206	1811567	All right.
1812708	1815491	Chell, while you're still on my good side, how was your gaming week?
1816152	1819133	Oh, you know, pretty chill, you know, when I get a free minute.
1819773	1823114	Usually, you know, during school months, I'm kind of a casual gamer.
1823755	1825815	I've mostly been getting my PC game on.
1826376	1827316	Can I plug something?
1828716	1829077	Absolutely.
1829417	1831758	Yeah, so there's this one indie game coming out.
1831798	1839900	I've only played the demo so far, but oh man, you know, I think it's made in RPG Maker or something very similar.
1840160	1841021	It's called Undertale.
1841681	1843702	And the lead creator is Toby Foxx.
1844602	1848344	Man, you know, give money to this developer any way you can.
1848384	1850044	If he's walking by, throw money at his head.
1850065	1852766	Because this was like, just the demo just blew me away.
1852846	1856347	It has all the emotional punches of, you know, Earthbound, which I'm pretty partial to.
1857008	1858048	What'd you say this guy's name was?
1858348	1858948	Toby Fox.
1859169	1862330	Oh, that poor guy you know has got to be getting asked, what does the fox say?
1862350	1865431	She is encouraging bags of pennies to be flung at his head.
1865772	1866052	Yes.
1866192	1866632	Just saying.
1866772	1868233	He will thank you through the tears.
1869133	1872496	Because, you know, he had a Kickstarter and, you know, that closed.
1872536	1874277	But, you know, this comes out, buy it.
1874337	1877359	You will thank yourself after you stop crying, which maybe never.
1878380	1881662	Wait, so is that like crying laughter or crying like this game is really sad?
1881762	1883904	Oh, crying, like they punch you in the emotions.
1883944	1888147	It's not even necessarily sad, but it's a really beautiful, unique game experience.
1888167	1891510	The whole thing is you're this kid lost in this kind of underground place.
1891550	1893011	So, you know, Earthbound.
1893031	1893251	Oh, my God.
1894031	1917824	and so the the combat is kind of unique the combat system is you can choose to spare a monster or fight them and the whole you know this has been kind of done before but it affects how people interact with you and yeah no it's saying what I love about it we'll spoil it that's how much you need to go out and like play the demo and yeah throw money at him hopefully paper
1918699	1929510	That's fair, because in the beginning when I first played Journey, and since the game's been out for over a year now, it's fair for me to spoil it, especially because I think everybody knows this twist.
1929991	1933975	I said it was best to go into Journey to not know that it's secretly a multiplayer game.
1934295	1934775	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1953487	1958508	that you know is a real person, but it's so hard to explain.
1958888	1963989	But it was one of those things because I didn't know when I played it for the first time that that was the twist in the game.
1964049	1972111	I was like, I want everybody to play Journey like that where they find out that twist on their own, and I think that kind of keeps it all the more shocking.
1973311	1975352	Sorry, the chat room made me think of another game.
1975772	1976732	I'm playing Mass Effect 3 again.
1977723	1978783	Of course, of course.
1979003	1981224	You know, emotional manipulation, I'm all for that.
1982204	1988666	I've also, you know, I really need to pick up the first Darkness, but I've also been playing Darkness 2 because I'm so topical.
1989106	1994568	And, you know, I really am enjoying the gameplay, but mostly I'm playing it for Mike Patton's juicy, juicy voice.
1997749	1998249	Fair enough.
1998369	2001090	Yeah, you know, I know it's been set up and down, but no post-production.
2001370	2003631	The man is demonically good.
2004691	2005111	Awesome.
2005952	2006352	All right.
2006692	2012475	Well, I'm sure the indie scene loves the fact that you're plugging that stuff.
2012535	2013956	So, yeah, by all means.
2014296	2015697	Is there a website that you know off the top of your head?
2016137	2019939	Well, they've got a Tumblr, and it's just search Undertale.
2020059	2020799	They should pop up.
2020859	2024421	I think they've got an official site, but so far it's just got the demo on it.
2024441	2028243	The Tumblr is mostly posting fan art right now and updates, which are kind of sparse.
2028463	2028623	Mm-hmm.
2029003	2035306	and, you know, I'm doing this completely unprompted, which, you know, I might appreciate a game kicked my way someday.
2036987	2038067	Fair enough, fair enough.
2038548	2040008	Not naming any names, Toby Fox.
2041329	2041629	All right.
2042530	2045471	All right, well, let's move on then, if that's everything Chell has for now.
2045651	2046852	We'll go over to Loki.
2047052	2047952	Loki, how was your gaming week?
2048292	2049413	I just played Grand Theft Auto.
2050971	2052072	Oh, Mass Effect.
2052312	2053212	There's a shock.
2054213	2059075	To be fair, I see Tim Tripp in the chat room says, oh man, I missed the Mass Effect tears.
2059335	2061336	That's kind of what prompted Jamie to go down that path.
2061416	2063437	She was provoked by chat.
2065081	2066863	Grand Theft Auto Online What's the game?
2083320	2085601	There's an actual storyline that goes along with it.
2085721	2091704	Basically, your character comes to Los Santos after Lamar, which is Franklin's friend in the single-player game.
2092104	2095446	He follows you on Life Invader, which is their version of Facebook.
2096926	2099367	You come into town and you're doing jobs for different people.
2099447	2103109	They have a guy, Simeon, that you're doing repos for.
2103229	2111233	There's some other guys that you're doing drug stuff for, stealing meth from people and
2111893	2139297	and that's just like the missions and then on top of all that you can do the free roaming stuff where you can rob liquor stores you can steal cars you can just shoot people you know one on one do that stuff or there's races death matches you can do skydiving stuff a whole bunch of different activities in the game and it's up to 16 players and you get randomly thrown in with some people usually and
2139837	2143520	and then on top of that you can do these death matches and stuff with other people.
2143600	2151607	So a lot of times what I've found is I'm getting dumped in a game, I'll go do a mission or something, I'll come back and it's not the same people in the same world anymore.
2151687	2153308	It's like a whole different set of people.
2154109	2156211	Did you have something to add to that, Chell?
2156531	2159754	I was just going to say kids, don't take drugs.
2160154	2160755	Buy your own.
2163757	2164578	Don't say that!
2166212	2167374	I've been enjoying it so far.
2167394	2171919	You get to create how your character looks based off of your ancestry and stuff.
2171939	2177325	They have different people that you pick as your grandparents and your parents.
2178426	2181189	Or you pick the grandparents and that alters what the parents look like and then
2181850	2183050	that alters what you look like.
2183671	2193094	And I heard, and I was reading an email a little bit ahead of the game, so I apologize for the email, or I'm going to spoil a little bit of their email, but I heard you can be a woman in Grand Theft Auto Online.
2193354	2198716	So that kind of helps the whole, like, you can never be one, but you can in Grand Theft Auto Online.
2199016	2199776	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2219562	2220003	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2238021	2239742	So they have to wait outside the store.
2240363	2241343	And so I know they're doing that.
2241403	2244446	So immediately when I go out there, I switch my gun and I shoot them.
2244746	2248568	Because I'm like... So you shoot kids is what you're saying here on the show.
2248648	2249989	I'm shooting kids playing the game.
2251290	2254793	Loki is the enforcement to keep kids out of Grand Theft Auto.
2255533	2257915	If he sees a child playing Grand Theft Auto, he will shoot them.
2258195	2261057	But you can do all sorts of things.
2261157	2263799	You can buy property in the game and garages.
2263979	2266681	And you can customize your cars and the way you look and everything.
2267481	2268381	It's just, it's kind of fun.
2268561	2273723	It's just this whole leveling up system and stuff and you level up your stats based on what you're doing in the game.
2273743	2277163	So, I don't know, I'm enjoying it.
2277183	2278384	I've been playing both on PS3 and 360.
2278844	2287425	The PS3, I'm on level 12 because I've been playing that mostly because my coworkers say, oh yeah, get the PS3 version, we're going to be totally on there playing PS3.
2287606	2289486	Yeah, not a single one of them on PS3.
2290146	2293329	So I may go back to 360 again and level up my character there.
2293389	2296231	But we have the crew.
2297031	2297632	It's open.
2297652	2299493	We've got our fun little logo there and stuff.
2299533	2306278	So Rockstar Social Club, look for crews, look for VOG Network, and you can sign up and come play with us, I guess.
2306478	2306918	There you go.
2307679	2310542	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2329181	2342300	and all that to get my seal or my I keep saying seals but there are tomes actually and that's really mostly what I've been doing I gotta say though I was really impressed with the ending I'm using my quotey fingers because you know it's an MMO it doesn't really end
2342640	2370259	but Final Fantasy XIV has a pretty definitive story from start to finish and when you finish the actual story you get like this 25 minute ending and I gotta say I was happy with it and it's simple but it's effective like for somebody that's really invested a lot of time in the game I was like I really get the sense that I accomplished something and now I see what's next for my character and that's such a great feeling playing an MMO which usually doesn't
2370999	2371619	Ever End.
2372039	2374080	So yeah, that's really all I can say.
2374120	2375440	I can't really talk about a lot of other games.
2375820	2379581	I will say I did pick up a new toy the other day.
2379801	2384962	I did pick up a new HD game capture card or I should say more like a box.
2385002	2385622	It's more a box.
2385722	2386962	It's like a USB connected thing.
2387242	2398344	And I am really excited because I purposely wanted to get something that would do the new consoles through HDMI and this does the old consoles because the component doubles as a composite plug-in.
2398664	2424826	So I am really excited to stream a variety of stuff as soon as I can get it working with my laptop and all that So that's something in the future, in the coming weeks So I will be able to diversify things a little more than just playing the same MMO all week long I'm going to force myself to do that I've been very busy with personal life stuff Rocky Horror, which I'm directing, is this coming Saturday So as you can imagine, I'm super busy with that
2425037	2428842	I wouldn't know anything about playing all games to the exception of all else.
2430084	2431626	And how many hours have you spent on Mass Effect?
2432066	2432387	Shut up.
2432867	2434089	Three digits or four now?
2434770	2435411	Shut up!
2436632	2436973	Alrighty.
2437774	2439015	That's enough for our gaming weeks.
2439536	2440657	Quickly, some housekeeping.
2441781	2443723	Actually, I actually have things for housekeeping tonight.
2444023	2447265	I want to plug another podcast I was on today and thank them for having me.
2447566	2450027	Check out the Let's Wow podcast.
2450348	2451629	That is World of Warcraft.
2452029	2457853	So yes, I still dabble in World of Warcraft even though I've talked about a lot of Final Fantasy XIV lately, but I did guest on their show tonight.
2458114	2460816	That's episode number 31 and you can check that out.
2460876	2464338	That'll be in their archive soon, available on iTunes and Stitcher and all that.
2464599	2466180	Again, that's the Let's Wow podcast.
2466480	2467601	Thank you kids for having me on.
2467621	2470163	And we talked about World of Warcraft and other MMOs.
2470884	2475348	And I razzed my good buddy Gemet for a good 500 minutes.
2476949	2477329	Let's see.
2477489	2478330	Other things I want to plug.
2478870	2485496	It is that time of year again where a lot of podcasts are going to be asking you to vote for them in the Podcast Awards.
2486056	2492662	Which is right now kind of what we have in the little podcast industry to recognize the podcast media world.
2493663	2499286	Sometimes I'm a little iffy on how I feel with it all being kind of a popularity contest at the end of the day.
2499807	2507912	But I will say being able to be nominated for it and collect the votes and stuff is really good promotion for us.
2508352	2517278	And it's always really nice to be able to kind of share in that with other gaming podcasts that really work hard for what they do.
2517378	2521701	So I hope we will get that honor again this year to be in the podcast awards.
2521761	2522382	But if we aren't,
2523082	2552406	we're still going to do what we do here every Sunday night regardless but I would encourage you podcastawards.com if you like what you hear here at Orange Lounge Radio please consider nominating us for best gaming podcast and because you can actually do you can do the one of the top two categories and a subcategory gaming is a subcategory we're also going to urge you to vote for people's choice for Orange Lounge Radio which kind of makes sense because we're a show about people and community and you guys all having a voice so people's choice and gaming
2552586	2553387	and We're Choice.
2554888	2556229	So there you go.
2556269	2557930	Check that out, podcastawards.com.
2558191	2565296	We really appreciate your consideration and consider supporting other independent podcasts that you listen to throughout other categories as well.
2565477	2570160	And if you feel that some other podcast is more deserving of a nomination than us, then that's cool.
2570501	2570901	We're good.
2571902	2575425	Just support your favorite show no matter who it may be.
2576451	2579714	Alright, I think that's it for housekeeping.
2579774	2584197	Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR, and Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
2584957	2587900	Alright, now we can have ourselves some gaming news.
2588120	2588780	So, Loki?
2589321	2591182	Let's get on to some gaming news.
2592303	2595826	Alright, so let's talk a little bit about the Xbox One.
2596286	2601270	It was, I guess, put out there this last week that...
2601630	2605451	It's going to take about 15 to 20 minutes to download the Xbox One Day One patch.
2606131	2610092	So expect a short delay before you get into your gaming.
2611192	2621035	Which, if I remember correctly, I believe that is a lot less of a wait than you had to for the Wii U. Wasn't that Wii U Day One patch like...
2623324	2626746	Well, that's because Nintendo's download servers are slow as hell.
2627366	2628126	Like, I don't know.
2628367	2629767	Well, I think they've gotten a lot better.
2630008	2634250	But remember, all the crazy Nintendo fanboys were all hammering that thing at the same time.
2634270	2638233	I mean, not that it excuses it, but it's the reason why it was downloading slow.
2639053	2639413	All right.
2640094	2646377	And then I was going to talk real quick because I actually had noticed this and I posted it on Twitter earlier this week about...
2647959	2650661	The next gen digital file sizes.
2650741	2651602	Holy shit.
2653163	2656366	So there's some new SKUs that are coming out for a bunch of different things.
2656667	2657367	And I don't know why.
2658208	2661011	I guess they're just trying to get people to buy in on this stuff.
2661031	2664654	But like NBA 2K14, they have a super fan pack.
2665154	2670299	And also for Call of Duty Ghosts, they have an Xbox edition.
2671380	2689749	and what these two things are is they're retail items that are digital that you go to the store and buy this packaging and it comes with codes for both the Xbox 360 version and the Xbox One version or in the case of NBA 2K, the Xbox 360, Xbox One version or PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4 version.
2692116	2697338	The fine print, though, tells you how big those files are, like how much hard drive space you need.
2697878	2701700	So it's not a big surprise that the current gen stuff is anywhere from 8 to 10 gigs.
2702240	2710223	The next gen stuff, and this is kind of like, you know, imagine if they went that way where they were trying to really push digital, 60 gigabytes.
2710703	2711403	Wow.
2711744	2711403	60.
2712184	2714845	That's a long fucking time to download that.
2714945	2719708	I mean, that is a good, like even on my good internet connection, about 15 hours.
2719788	2721709	Yeah, that's a lot of HD stuff.
2722249	2727932	And I mean, isn't it still out there, these caps on bandwidth that people get in a month?
2728092	2729313	I think there might be some.
2729333	2733235	I think Comcast suspended theirs for a little while and they were going to up it to 300 gigs.
2733295	2736156	But still, imagine Comcast up their thing to 300 gigs.
2736196	2739018	That's like six games in a month, which I guess that is a lot.
2739458	2742319	But, I mean, and then nothing else on your internet.
2742459	2743439	So, let's be real.
2743459	2746339	It's still, I mean, that's a long time to wait for something digitally.
2746419	2753301	And, yeah, I understand that they do have the technology where they can start streaming the game after a certain amount of it's downloaded.
2753341	2758342	But, shit, even if it's half of it, that's still eight hours that you have to wait before you can start playing that game.
2759502	2764863	And if that's something that you're planning on buying at launch, you know, you might as well just...
2765743	2767085	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2781107	2781307	and so on.
2809804	2817889	One of the reasons why their big ideas of making this all digital world is just not feasible right now with our internet infrastructure.
2817910	2818730	It's just not going to work.
2820051	2820591	So, that's it.
2821712	2822592	Well, what do you think though?
2822633	2828816	If the console life cycle is like 10 years or whatever, do you think that maybe in that amount of time we will be at that point?
2829477	2830077	Possibly.
2830377	2837342	I mean, it's going to take some sort of, I think, government funding to kind of put, you know,
2839215	2850922	I guess get these companies to want to improve their infrastructure because right now a lot of these companies have monopolies in the different areas and so there's really no need for them to try to get their internet speeds faster.
2850982	2859266	Just like with Comcast, I was trying to get this one plan that they had that was $70 because I pay about $60, $70 right now for just internet.
2859747	2864910	It's in a different area where it's double the internet speed that I have now plus cable for the same price.
2865950	2866630	And of course...
2867711	2869812	Oh, I'm sorry, that plan's not in our area.
2869993	2872234	Of course.
2873095	2873715	That's the problem.
2873735	2889645	There's monopolies everywhere, so they're not going to be in a big hurry to offer faster internet without some sort of government funding, because why bother spending the money on the upgrade or service when we can just charge more and keep the same level of service or decline it?
2890826	2895888	Alright, well, one thing people were using their bandwidth for this week was to watch the latest Nintendo Direct.
2896108	2903731	You know, Nintendo likes to do these where they just take the news, they take their case straight to their hardcore fanbase, and it's been working for better or worse for them.
2904632	2910514	They unveiled the latest Nintendo Direct on October 1st, which kind of ran down, here's where Nintendo's at for the end of the year.
2911475	2911955	One big...
2912495	2913275	I'm gonna go out on a limb.
2934585	2935966	and say that this is strategy.
2936847	2948817	I don't know if this was necessarily because the game's not done, but this was maybe to buff up 2014, this coming winter, where things didn't work out so well in 2013.
2948997	2951499	I think you're right because they had too much stuff coming out.
2951699	2954161	In the fourth quarter, there's too much stuff coming out.
2954181	2957624	Nintendo themselves, they have Wii Fit U in the beginning of November.
2957984	2958645	Super Mario 3D World
2981412	2984294	I'm thinking more like April at this point.
2984655	2989339	Maybe there's something happening there where they want to strategically spread out the first party releases.
2989439	2993183	Plus, I don't think there are a lot of releases on the Wii U right now.
2993503	2998248	We're running into the same situation we did last year where there was nothing coming out for a few months.
2998788	3000070	I think that's what we're going to see now.
3000610	3006317	I definitely know there's nothing coming out in December and there's nothing coming out right now in January.
3006337	3009942	Well how does Xbox One and PlayStation 4 look for next year in the winter?
3010022	3013026	I mean aren't they going to be the ones that are kind of hurting for games in the winter?
3013354	3022176	I think everyone's going to run in the same situation, but right now we don't have a firm lineup for what we have for the first quarter of the year.
3022656	3025397	They haven't really announced that stuff yet.
3025417	3032779	Probably later on into the fourth quarter we'll know that because right now their focus is on the fourth quarter.
3033259	3039521	I don't think anything's going to get delayed to the beginning part of the year, but they still haven't made their announcements of what titles they have coming up.
3040201	3048286	EA hasn't announced what they really have coming aside from... Yeah, but EA's not a factor on Wii U either.
3048706	3049106	True.
3049506	3050087	Yeah, very true.
3050107	3051327	Unfortunately.
3052488	3056270	But even like other companies, there's just no big titles that have been announced yet.
3056330	3058411	At least not a lot of titles for February.
3058471	3060873	Well, WhatUpG says Titanfall is next spring, right?
3060953	3061753	I guess that's a big one.
3061813	3063454	I think that's more summer.
3063594	3064955	I don't think that's coming out in spring at all.
3064975	3065435	Do you think Destiny?
3065435	3066716	I think Destiny's going to be that same time frame too.
3066756	3067297	I know that's a big one.
3067337	3068018	I think Destiny's, yeah.
3068218	3069179	Maybe fourth quarter.
3069599	3072081	It's second half of the, or at least second quarter, I think.
3072222	3072622	Fair enough.
3072902	3075485	Going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.
3075605	3080890	SSJ100Matt says, further proves that their whole E3 conference video just showed 2014 games.
3082131	3084854	Captain Spike says, absolutely gutted about Donkey Kong.
3085174	3086796	One of my most anticipated games of 2013.
3088550	3097874	Well, at least you're still getting a solid platformer in the form of Super Mario 3D World, which some of the early previews are coming back very positive, which is no surprise at all.
3098354	3101535	I mean, you know, a lot of the Mario games are very strong performers.
3101675	3102255	I can't think.
3102876	3104876	What was the last one that people didn't like?
3105297	3105817	Sunshine?
3105977	3106677	That was a while ago.
3106957	3107657	Hotel Mario?
3108138	3108498	What's that?
3109298	3110398	Hotel Mario.
3110438	3111159	That's a long time ago.
3111179	3112139	Hey, Sunshine was fun.
3112319	3114559	Yeah, Sunshine still has its defenders.
3114720	3117260	I liked Sunshine, actually, myself.
3117400	3120261	So, I mean, most Mario platformers aren't bad.
3120581	3121161	They just aren't.
3121321	3123282	I mean, there's been some that are like, that's okay.
3123802	3126123	But most of them are very, very good.
3127783	3133865	So at least you got a solid platformer in that to look forward to in November now in Japan and Europe.
3135085	3139108	Sonic will be coming to Super Smash Brothers, whatever they call it.
3139609	3141950	Well, I see you rolling your eyes over there, Loki.
3142110	3145032	I was actually a little surprised because of the fact it's a third-party character.
3145072	3147554	I didn't think they'd recycle those, but I guess... Really?
3147654	3153158	Yeah, because Nintendo's not publishing Mario and Sonic at the Olympics, a game that was a Sega game.
3153398	3154039	I guess.
3154519	3155760	This is not surprising at all.
3155960	3156681	It's about surprising.
3156921	3158462	Oh, hey, Luigi's in this game.
3158862	3159042	Oh.
3159142	3159543	Yeah.
3159703	3160103	All right.
3160163	3160563	Fair enough.
3160583	3162185	More surprising they said he wasn't in the game.
3162405	3162565	Mm-hmm.
3162825	3164486	Next step character, Scarlet Witch.
3166326	3166767	Let's hope.
3168127	3168547	Let's see.
3168827	3171568	And Pikmin 3 is getting DLC.
3171968	3177070	Nintendo's kind of further going down the DLC spiral with Pikmin 3 DLC.
3177310	3178551	But a lot of people looking forward to it.
3178571	3182833	And, you know, I got to say the Super Luigi U was pretty good.
3183213	3186574	So, I mean, if Nintendo can keep making robust DLC packages like that,
3186894	3188014	This isn't a bad thing at all.
3188775	3190175	Also, some folks very excited.
3190275	3197778	I'm sure Actdeft was screaming, shaking, crying, and convulsing over the fact that there is a new Kirby game on its way to the 3DS.
3199318	3202439	As if the 3DS needed more powerhouse games, but here's another one.
3202819	3204960	Kirby's on its way, and Loki's going, yep, yep.
3205280	3206301	That's what I was saying.
3206341	3210042	Like, you know, all these announcements like, wow, more great titles for the 3DS, and then like,
3210262	3210922	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3234389	3234830	Outro Music
3256352	3259233	Zelda A Link Between Worlds Dungeons can be played in any order
3273579	3273899	DarkSakura
3296718	3301386	So I would imagine there's still going to be an optimal order, just like in any Mega Man game or something.
3301426	3309300	But the cool thing is it'll kind of open it up for those speed runners and people that like to bend the rules a little bit to try different patterns.
3309340	3310062	So that'll be pretty cool.
3310427	3320090	Yeah, I'm just looking forward to it being just a smash hit and quieting the people who will not shut up about Ocarina of Time slash Majora's Mask.
3320450	3321811	Guys, we all love those games.
3322211	3323652	They're not the only Zelda games.
3323712	3324252	Come on.
3324332	3324972	Thank you.
3325492	3327253	Will you give me a fist bump for that statement?
3327313	3328293	Thank you very much.
3328573	3330134	Thank you.
3331074	3333295	Those games, Ocarina, they have their place, but...
3334656	3335536	Link to the Past
3360794	3367055	When you go there, whoever was last there, their data is on the little machine waiting for you to get it on your 3DS.
3367075	3369256	Well, they're going to upgrade these relay points.
3369816	3372356	Six people now will be on these things.
3372396	3375217	So if you go to Starbucks, you can get up to six people on these things.
3375357	3382198	That's even better because I actually do go to... There's this one that Becky and I go to at least twice a week.
3382419	3382759	Yeah, I know.
3382779	3383199	That's great.
3383279	3383859	That's awesome news.
3384319	3388840	And some content distribution events are planned for use over the relay.
3388900	3389080	So...
3390881	3391301	Interesting.
3392422	3392962	Very cool stuff.
3393002	3396705	I guess it'll push demos through to your 3DS if you opt in for it, so that'll be really cool.
3398346	3401068	DarkSakura, I think you have more Nintendo stuff for us, right?
3401228	3402689	But I'm putting my island up.
3403189	3404150	Yes, I do have other news.
3404690	3407472	Thank you, Actdeft, because I've really been wanting an island for a while.
3408553	3412697	Well, how about the new Wii U firmware?
3412777	3415019	It's also going to have a bunch of other features now.
3415459	3420084	It's going to be 700 megabytes, so it's going to take a while to download.
3420924	3429512	But it has internet browser updates, it has more demos and trial software, USB keyboard support, Dolby ProLogic 2...
3430933	3451103	Smartphones will be able to connect to the Nintendo Network ID You can view a friends list from the Wii U menu You have your headset that can hook to the gamepad and be used for chat And you can read PDF files on the Wii U And you can also save your passwords for websites So, lots of stuff
3451223	3451984	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3466483	3469465	Well, no, I mean, it'll get done in 30 minutes.
3469505	3474869	But my point is, don't wait until the day Mario 3D comes out to do this.
3475469	3486496	Like, if you're listening to my voice and you own a Wii U and you haven't done this yet, you probably just want to go turn that guy on right now and just let the update be over and done with and then be ready for, you know, Zelda Wind Waker HD or whatever the next game is you're going to get.
3486516	3489719	Or get up in the morning, have it update, and call your mom.
3490999	3493141	Or whichever relative you have living right now.
3493721	3494922	Fair enough, fair enough.
3495242	3496063	Talk to them!
3496323	3496527	Thanks for watching!
3497273	3499214	and go outside and get some fresh air.
3500115	3500655	Get a job.
3500815	3501796	Wait, I need to get a job.
3502817	3503277	All right, Loki.
3504558	3504938	All right.
3506159	3506879	So let's see here.
3506919	3513224	Let's talk a little bit about PlayStation 3 getting its own firmware update as well.
3513244	3520789	4.5 finally came out and what it does is adds the auto downloads to people that are not in PlayStation Plus.
3521209	3526853	So you'll be able to also transfer data between your PlayStation 3 and Vita via Wi-Fi.
3527693	3532257	Um, and Ethernet connections, I guess originally you can only do it through the transfer cable that they had.
3533738	3540943	And also, um, lets you, uh, set up, I guess, um, groups of players, um, that can see your trophies.
3541644	3543325	So you can either have that open to everybody.
3543505	3552292	I don't know why you wouldn't want to, why you would hide your trophies from people unless, unless there was like a trophy for going to the strip club a lot of times and Grand Theft Auto 5 or something, you know, I, I don't know.
3553447	3558713	Well, remember when I was getting all those achievements in Dance Dance Revolution Universe?
3558733	3561215	Because I had it like the day it came out and I started playing it right away.
3561596	3563998	And I got a message from... What was his name?
3564098	3566301	That guy who had all the achievements.
3566321	3570065	He ended up getting banned from Xbox because it turns out they were... Oh, Strip Club DJ.
3570085	3570565	That was his name.
3570946	3574109	He sent me a message like, how are getting the achievements in that game?
3574149	3574870	What's the difficulty?
3575250	3575471	Like...
3576111	3577373	I don't even know how he found me.
3577413	3581339	I think he used one of those websites that shows you who's doing well in achievements.
3581619	3587127	And I think at that moment in time, I had more achievement points in that game than anyone else on release day.
3587608	3591373	So maybe if I'm in that situation again, I want to hide trophies.
3591694	3591774	Oh!
3592515	3606854	it just occurred to me if I'm reviewing games people might ask me to turn that feature on to not spoil because a lot of the trophy lists leak from review copies so maybe that's to encourage critics and so forth to not leak it I bet that would be one
3608548	3609389	Anyways, they have it.
3610309	3612150	So, cool.
3612910	3615931	But yeah, so basically, so the auto-download's kind of cool.
3616311	3617991	About time everybody gets that.
3618011	3624453	Here's the thing, okay, and this isn't really PlayStation, but like, you know, speaking of system updates and stuff, fucking 360, man.
3624953	3633776	Every time I log in live now, I'm still getting that fucking prompt to add a second, like, a second method to confirm my passwords or stuff if I need to.
3634636	3636837	You know, like a second way they can contact me, basically.
3637017	3639738	And I've filled it out a bunch of times.
3640018	3644259	And I've even filled it out via texting, via email.
3644819	3648879	And it still fucking says, oh, sorry, you only have one form to contact you.
3649220	3649960	Are you okay with this?
3649980	3650980	I'm like, yes, I'm okay with this.
3651280	3654801	Nope, sorry, you need to please add another way to contact us.
3654821	3655401	That's weird.
3655441	3656961	And I even did it through the website.
3656981	3658902	They have a special website you go to to confirm that.
3659082	3660442	Because obviously it says, oh, yeah.
3661282	3662583	You can go ahead and add it through this.
3662703	3663163	Oh, I'm sorry.
3663203	3664644	Actually, no, you can't add it through this.
3664944	3666604	You have to go onto this website to do it.
3666684	3670826	And I did that, and it confirmed it, and it still fucking doesn't work.
3670926	3672787	And I get prompted every fucking time I log in.
3672807	3674087	You need to call Microsoft or something.
3674147	3674948	It's not like something's wrong.
3674968	3677829	You need to fucking flip them off is what I need to do.
3677869	3679129	Aren't you kind of doing that right now?
3682431	3689894	Because Microsoft executives right now and their tech support are listening to the show and going, oh, no, one customer is having a problem.
3691209	3693710	Well, I'm a customer that has a podcast.
3693950	3694691	Fear me.
3695271	3696612	He's a loud-ass customer.
3696672	3698533	Let's be real, DarkSakura.
3699093	3699634	So are you.
3699734	3701174	Where everyone has a voice.
3701354	3701995	That's right.
3702175	3704096	And we use our voice to say, fuck you!
3705036	3705297	All right.
3706777	3710479	Speaking of consoles and things, one console will be going away.
3710820	3711700	Rest in peace.
3712260	3712741	Bye.
3713781	3715662	It's Nintendo's Wii, believe it or not.
3715702	3720185	Nintendo's Wii will be ending production soon in Japan.
3721385	3723327	We don't have any word about the U.S.
3723447	3725149	or other territories, Canada, Europe.
3725169	3725569	We don't know.
3725929	3729973	But in Japan, let's be real, the Wii isn't selling so hot anymore.
3731334	3734817	985 Wii units were sold in a week, which really isn't a lot.
3735197	3737219	So the Wii is going to be fading to black.
3737679	3740081	And it kind of makes sense for Nintendo.
3740642	3743404	Push the Wii U. Make people buy that to play the games.
3743424	3744605	It makes sense for them.
3744986	3746807	So, yep, they'll be sunsetting the Wii.
3748749	3758537	I would bet that maybe trying to push the Wii U a little harder, especially in a year where in Japan there's no competition, isn't exactly a bad move.
3759258	3761700	So, nice knowing you, Wii.
3761880	3763902	Good not to have yourself as competition.
3764543	3764823	Right?
3765483	3768504	Well, in a way, that's what Nintendo would have right now in Japan.
3768624	3780949	If you think about it in terms of production costs, making a machine that no one's buying, then, yeah, there's no need to keep putting the production money into it when you could be using it for Wii U. I mean, what is going to be on the shelves in Japan?
3780989	3783210	There's Wii U. Now there's not a Wii.
3783570	3786671	There's 360, but in Japan, that's not a factor.
3786691	3786911	Sorry.
3787151	3787811	And the PlayStation 3.
3789032	3792393	So it's literally going to be, do you want the new system or the old system?
3792813	3794134	That's the way it is in Japan right now.
3794554	3794854	DarkSakura.com
3812722	3814723	Yes, because I'm always good that way.
3815223	3818685	Well, here is something that- How long have you had some of my games?
3821827	3825208	What, you mean that I've actually played?
3825288	3826849	I'm just giving you credit.
3826869	3827369	Playing games.
3827850	3828050	Okay.
3828550	3830511	So, well, this should interest you.
3831371	3832352	You like SimCity, don't you?
3833092	3834373	I like the old SimCity.
3834513	3835894	I like the first SimCity game.
3836274	3838816	I like SimCity Action News on the CD-ROM.
3838856	3839396	Remember that?
3839796	3841077	Do I have to go get those YouTubes?
3841097	3841637	Because I will.
3842878	3843038	Ah!
3843138	3845379	There's a big... No.
3846280	3847401	They should make me a voice actor.
3848922	3852404	Well, Maxis is considering an offline mode for SimCity.
3853564	3860569	The note was put on the State of SimCity blog where the Emeryville manager, Patrick Butcher, I guess...
3861229	3875553	is saying that they are considering an offline mode, apparently since a lot of people, yes, Alan, I will check out your Saturn, since a lot of people have been complaining that it is specifically on.
3876193	3882034	The quote says, right now we have a team specifically focused on exploring the possibility of an offline mode.
3882435	3884155	I can't make any promises on when we will have
3884215	3892192	have more information but we know this is something that many of our players have been asking for so who knows maybe it'll be sooner rather than later
3892572	3893233	I'm interested.
3894814	3897696	I don't have the game yet, but I'm interested in offline mode.
3898236	3901819	Here's my concern, because SimCity is starting to come down in price a little bit.
3903080	3910806	I have a feeling that they'll do it as part of an expansion or something to get you to spend the full $60, which, I mean, whatever.
3911106	3917571	I would consider still spending it on an offline SimCity that doesn't require Origin, but we'll see.
3918581	3929903	Yeah, well, I honestly, and just on the same note, I wish that there would be updates across the board for all of them so you don't have to use Origin, but that's me.
3931344	3932804	And everybody else that plays Mass Effect 3.
3934304	3941166	Alright, traveling around the world and checking out some release dates, things that will be coming a little sooner than SimCity Offline Mode.
3941246	3941446	Loki.
3942183	3946127	This week on PlayStation 3, we have Beyond Two Souls coming out.
3947188	3953255	Also, Borderlands 2 Game of the Year Edition making its way out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.
3954055	3956718	Disgaea D2, A Brighter Darkness on PlayStation 3.
3956778	3962604	The Capcom Essentials Collection on Xbox 360 and PS3.
3963826	3964967	That's a bunch of old games, by the way.
3966307	3991914	Just Dance 2014 on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, and Wii U Dishonored Game of the Year Edition on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC and then let's see here also on Saturday it's a small portable game called Pokemon X and Y those will be coming out in 3DS
3992904	3993884	Might sell a couple copies.
3993925	3995845	Yeah, they may make a couple.
3996846	4002528	And then on Sunday, they have Skylanders Swap Force.
4003349	4008431	It's new because you can take the top part of the character and put it on the bottom part of another character.
4008831	4009992	Woo!
4010172	4011152	Innovation!
4011172	4011633	Swapping!
4011793	4012553	And jumping!
4012593	4013834	You can jump now!
4013914	4014014	Woo!
4016166	4017968	Sell me a thousand copies already.
4018229	4021754	It will sell much more than a thousand copies.
4022816	4030227	Yes, so... Hey, you know, my five-year-old nephew is nuts about that game, so... Has your five-year-old nephew checked out Disney Infinity as well?
4031042	4051086	I have permanently disbarred him from anything Disney related online so no wow this sounds like a story I'd like to see I also want to mention that also on Saturday that coincide with the Pokemon X and Y on the 3DS you can buy a 2DS one less DS in there
4051664	4058106	If 3D is too much for you... If the 3D will blow your mind, the 2D will just kind of simmer your mind.
4058246	4065948	I am hearing, take it with a grain of salt, but I am hearing that the 2DS, a lot of people kind of like the way it feels when they play it, for what it's worth.
4066248	4071710	I mean, despite the fact that a lot of people have been very critical about the design and how it doesn't fold the same way and so forth.
4072070	4075411	Hearing a lot of positive feedback about kind of how it feels when it's in your hands, so...
4076431	4089506	I like to mention though, even though I do happen to peruse the Evil G website for some release dates sometimes, I am kind of confused at why they're selling GoPro accessories for GameStop
4091368	4092409	I don't know, I don't know
4107943	4134594	Also coming out in Japan on the 10th, F1 2013, Grand Theft Auto V's Japanese release, Mineno Golf 6 gets a best release, a price reduction, Sakatsuku Pro Soccer Club Osukoru comes out from Sega, and Tales of Symphonia, the Unisonant Pack comes out in, there's like a regular, there's a Famitsu Deluxe Pack, and there's a Lala Bit Market Limited Edition Pack.
4135214	4136095	So there's all that.
4136275	4138236	If you're Tales of Symphonia, looking forward to that.
4138777	4145521	Also worth mentioning, a game called Fairy Fencer F comes out from Compile in a regular and limited edition.
4146822	4148544	Fairy Fencer, is that like fencing?
4148844	4150645	Like what you see in the Olympics?
4150685	4152727	You put them on a spike.
4153467	4153847	DarkSakura.com
4174432	4176233	Now, by fairies, do you mean vocaloids?
4176253	4177433	Because that's what they look more like.
4177854	4178754	I think it might be.
4179234	4179854	I'm not sure.
4179954	4181975	But fairy fencing.
4182296	4185257	They're fencing your face off, basically, if you're that grizzly bear.
4185337	4186097	I'm a fenced.
4186457	4186837	Wait.
4189048	4193312	Alright, let's see what's coming out on other systems in Japan this week.
4193852	4196314	Moving on over to the Xbox 360.
4196555	4212189	Haha, I know, but there are still things coming out, including Grand Theft Auto V, F1 2013, the Batman Arkham Pack, and there's an Xbox Live 12-month, 2-gold membership card that comes with Grand Theft Auto V. I don't really know what that means, but that is something that is happening in Japan.
4212789	4214511	They probably had something similar here, I just missed it.
4215191	4216451	on the PlayStation Vita this week.
4216511	4218972	Dream Club Zero Portable gets a price reduction.
4219932	4224193	A new game called Getsui Gakuen Kou comes out this week.
4224213	4224653	Wait, wait, wait, what?
4225293	4229234	Getsui Gakuen Kou comes out this week.
4229254	4229974	Gakuen is cool.
4230494	4231494	Can I see what that looks like?
4231734	4232474	You sure can.
4232875	4233255	Thank you.
4233335	4236035	This is the one screenshot I have.
4237315	4239536	Unless this other, let me check out this other page.
4239576	4240096	Might have more.
4240643	4241504	Some school thing.
4241524	4243025	Fantastic radio here we have.
4243045	4244226	Well, that has an extra screenshot.
4244886	4246147	Or that just shows what it comes with.
4246427	4246527	Oh.
4246827	4248449	Oh, I want to see what the limited edition comes with.
4248469	4251131	Because I thought I've heard of it before, but I don't remember offhand.
4251351	4251631	Aha.
4251811	4258516	It looks like they get the game, a book, maybe a school book, a music CD, and trading cards?
4259116	4259416	Stickers?
4259436	4260457	That's a drama CD.
4263279	4268663	No, the CD is basically like a play, like radio drama.
4269545	4293417	so maybe this is like based off some type of drama series maybe all right uh also on the PlayStation Vita Metal Gear Solid HD edition getting a price reduction uh and I think some new Vita equipment comes out this week is this the week of the Vita Slim model it is so this is the week where you're black khaki black light blue white light lime green white pink black white and black
4293797	4295178	Slim Models all come out.
4295498	4297338	So no wonder there's so much on the Vita this week.
4298699	4300079	Oh my gosh, there's Slaughter Mania 5.
4300899	4302420	Like slaughter, like slot machines.
4302480	4304661	Not like I'm going to go kill a bunch of zombies, Slaughter Mania.
4305841	4308522	Uncharted Golden Abyss gets a re-release in the best hits.
4309262	4311083	Soul Sacrifice gets a re-release.
4312103	4318125	And then Sakatsuku Pro Soccer Club Oh Sukru comes out this week also.
4318205	4320286	So lots of stuff going on on the Vita this week.
4321974	4325617	Now that makes sense, now that I see that the Vita Slim is out this week.
4325777	4327218	So I'm sure there'll be some people here for that.
4327618	4331841	On the Wii U, sadly nothing to report this week, but Rayman Legends coming up next week.
4332241	4333242	You got a little time.
4334043	4338966	And on the Nintendo 3DS this week, Pokemon X and Y is also on Japan.
4339026	4340207	It's like a worldwide release.
4341008	4343409	Also a big release for them on the 12th.
4343670	4346371	And there's all sorts of accessories.
4346792	4349133	You can get Froakie pens.
4350114	4356955	You can get Chesapeed pouch, Chespin, excuse me, pouches and Lord knows what else.
4357035	4357496	There you go.
4357976	4360656	All that coming out in Japan this week on the 3DS.
4361436	4362096	DarkSakura?
4363097	4367618	Well, we have a pretty slender selection for the UK.
4368198	4378320	On the 9th there's Montague's Mount for PC and stupid thing reloaded and on the 11th we have Beyond Two Souls for PS3.
4378580	4379140	That's about it.
4380538	4382279	All right, just a couple more news stories for you guys.
4382299	4384441	And then the classic game of the week.
4384761	4386022	And it will surprise no one.
4386782	4387122	Loki.
4388323	4388643	All right.
4390745	4391505	So let's see here.
4392806	4403713	SNK, they are getting rid of the Neo Geo X. You may remember the Neo Geo X is kind of that rebuild, I guess, of the classic Neo Geo.
4404693	4409395	They also had this portable system that was plugged into this dock.
4410736	4412176	It was kind of emulating everything.
4414197	4425142	But now they have cease and desist against the website that sells the Neo Geo X. I guess they were saying that the notice, which appeared on October 2nd,
4425982	4443816	Demands an immediate cease and desist of manufacturing, distribution, promotion, and selling of the Neo Geo X Gold Limited Edition Mega Pack Volume 1 and Classic Volumes 1 through 5, as well as the Neo Geo X Arcade Stick, in order to protect our intellectual property rights, such as Neo Geo and SNK.
4444657	4453520	See, here I thought, me being naive, I guess, that they had the go-ahead to go ahead and make that stuff since it had SNK on it and it was a fucking Neo Geo.
4454120	4455300	I mean, at least it looked like one.
4456061	4457661	Come to find out, they didn't.
4457941	4459642	They just kind of put it out there anyways.
4459822	4460302	Wow.
4461022	4462023	It's been out for a while, too.
4462043	4464425	I was going to say, I forgot the thing even came out.
4464485	4465426	How horrible is that?
4465926	4467768	But, I mean, they've recycled those Neo Geo games.
4467788	4472832	Like, a ton of them are available on Virtual Console and PlayStation 3 download.
4472872	4477275	I mean, you know, if you want something a little more authentic, I guess you could get this.
4477375	4481518	But, I mean... Keep in mind, those licensed ones, SNK gets money for.
4481839	4482139	True.
4483000	4487183	They would get no money if they didn't provide their license.
4488194	4489235	Okay, here's what it is.
4489395	4489955	I get it now.
4490595	4494097	I guess it was licensed because Tomo was the one that was putting it out.
4494117	4495998	They do a lot of license weird shit.
4497039	4501922	But now they're ending their license agreement, so it's no longer going to be sold after the 2nd.
4502262	4502542	Wow.
4503903	4504743	The 2nd of October?
4505104	4505404	Yeah.
4505484	4506264	Well, then it's done.
4506464	4507105	It's done, yes.
4509266	4509827	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4529878	4530379	No company for E.T.
4530419	4530819	down there.
4530879	4531940	I'll stick with my Neo Geo.
4553971	4554972	You got the real thing, though.
4555012	4557275	I mean, why even bother with this stuff if you have the real thing?
4557315	4559177	Because it has the games loaded on the system.
4559457	4560478	I guess that's true.
4560538	4562921	And you know how much I paid for the last cartridge I bought?
4563841	4566785	We paid $300 for, what was the last one we got?
4567125	4567605	King of Fighters 2000.
4568496	4570917	Wow.
4570957	4571797	When I had money.
4571817	4573318	It blows me away how much those cartridges cost.
4573358	4578759	I like the bootleg ones, the 48-in-1s, the 107, where there's a ton of them on one cartridge.
4579019	4579520	Bobby knows.
4581120	4581400	All right.
4582380	4586782	One more story about Terraria, which has its hardcore fans.
4587082	4590343	I saw Terraria on PlayStation 3 this weekend.
4590383	4593144	I was at Fry's randomly when I got the capture box.
4593444	4595645	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4614791	4616032	It's a thing that's happening.
4616713	4627540	Andrew Spinks, the creator of Terraria, talked about Terraria 2, saying, It is definitely something that will be happening, but contrary to several of the articles that went live today, I have not started development.
4628020	4633123	I have a list of features and mechanics I want the game to have, but that is the extent of the development at this point.
4633504	4636266	So, in other words, he's going to do it.
4636726	4638847	It's announced in that regard, but that's it.
4639107	4642730	We don't have anything else, so don't plan on this happening anytime soon.
4644891	4645351	Let's see.
4645592	4658477	Also in the interview, mentioned that version 1.2 will be the last seven-month update for the original game, but that he will change the endgame up for the update within the next month or two because there was no final boss.
4659077	4662239	And there may be some other smaller updates a few more months down the line.
4662999	4668501	He might hire a team to do some updates, but he'll be focusing on Terraria 2 soon.
4669282	4669782	So there you go.
4670422	4672163	DarkSakura, you played a little bit of Terraria, right?
4672183	4672263	Yeah.
4672580	4672940	DarkSakura
4696075	4696756	DarkSakura.com
4726437	4728019	It is a life sim game.
4728600	4730623	And I miss this music, Rob.
4731324	4732105	The old school music.
4733587	4734148	Wasn't it good?
4734168	4735409	It was good.
4741061	4743743	I was actually running around the house making up lyrics to this to Midna.
4744083	4745403	She was looking at me like I was insane.
4746304	4748205	She probably does that a lot, I bet.
4748405	4748825	Shut up.
4749466	4758070	So anyway, and of course the one that I linked on here is actually the Nintendo 64 one, which was the very first Dobutsu no Mori.
4760171	4765814	It came out in Japan on April 14th, 2001, and came out on the GameCube as Animal Force Plus.
4766994	4767094	In
4770410	4771951	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4798262	4802745	So the game itself is... No, Bobby, I'm not doing Halo.
4803705	4807668	So the game itself has evolved over time.
4808588	4816053	But I'm going to focus on the GameCube one since that is probably the one the majority of us have started with.
4816634	4826580	So with the very first game, and it was like this on the Nintendo 64 as well, you would arrive in town homeless.
4828523	4837135	and get forced into indentured servitude by the evil Tom Nook, who is the mobster boss of your town.
4837999	4842582	It's, in all reality, you know, it's a very open-ended game.
4842642	4843242	It keeps going.
4843282	4845483	You have different holidays in town.
4845963	4849065	You have to, you know, earn money and pay off your mortgage.
4849725	4851406	And you can expand your house.
4852667	4853607	No, no, no, no.
4853687	4855988	People were there to collect NES games.
4856089	4857089	That's what they were there for.
4857209	4858430	I was getting to that.
4858530	4860171	Sorry, I can't contain myself.
4861211	4861632	Rab.
4862832	4874160	So anyway, you have to, you know, you earn bells, which is the in-game currency, pay off your loan, and in the... And you hit villagers with bug nets.
4874594	4877315	You know, I keep hitting that fucker Ed with a bug net and he won't move.
4878535	4881236	I'm not the only one having to deal with Ed, by the way.
4882456	4883336	He's a dumb horse.
4883617	4889278	So anyway, you also could collect Nintendo Entertainment games.
4890198	4900881	And as far as I'm aware, I think this just popped up in... I want to say just in the GameCube ones.
4902042	4902122	Um...
4903760	4904941	Ice Climber, Mario Bros.
4905061	4905322	e-reader
4922519	4946709	um so yeah there were different multiplayer modes as well where you could have up to four people living in the village um you couldn't play at the same time as anybody else but you could take turns like Dan and I would see who could pay off our mortgage faster and who got the gold statue and who got the silver statue and finally I'm like bitch make your own town so he has Danville that was his town
4948673	4951916	Robville or something silly.
4972596	4974558	Dan had Danville because Danville exists.
4975498	4981163	You could also leave messages to each other on the big board that's in the center of town.
4982824	4984465	I still do that when I visit people's towns.
4984605	4985986	I'll say, hey, Jamie was here.
4986246	4987708	So-and-so sucks.
4987808	4988548	Steal Ed from me.
4988828	4990069	Still trying to steal Kabuki from you.
4992291	4993532	Now this I wanted to play a little bit. ...
4998121	5000163	Do you hear how the voice sounds?
5001904	5008989	Now, in the Japanese version, basically, they say every syllable, every kana.
5009890	5015054	So you can actually, I mean, it's really sped up and fast, but you can actually kind of pick out what they're saying.
5015755	5022420	For the American, for the English versions, basically, they say each letter, so it really does sound like a bunch of gibberish.
5023601	5023681	Um...
5025222	5030265	And the voices, of course, went a little bit differently because I had to redo them to say each of the letters.
5031446	5040051	You had another thing that was only in the earlier ones, and that was Mr. Resetti, or as he was called in Japan, I think he was Resetsan.
5040992	5047876	So if you turned off your game without saving, the next time you turned it on, he'd pop out of the ground and berate you for like an hour.
5047916	5050038	So basically he annoyed you into not doing it again.
5051759	5062502	Now, the part that's showing on the video right now, if you can kind of hear some of it, is where you talk to Rover, who basically, he asks you questions, and depending on how you answer it, determines what your looks are.
5063202	5067603	So, I always cheat and use an FAQ so that my character will look how I want her to look.
5069483	5074404	Now, with the GameCube One, you could also use the Game Boy Advance to do stuff on the island.
5075084	5076425	You were able to...
5078726	5079986	Thank you for watching.
5080006	5080447	See you next time.
5101258	5117203	Now, there's another thing that is still one of my favorite parts of the game, is that you had a character who, in the Japanese version, his name was Todakeke, who, if I remember right, he was named after a music composer.
5118364	5119184	Over here, he's K.K.
5119204	5119484	Slider.
5120838	5124539	and he would sing different songs.
5124619	5128119	In the old ones he would sing in, I believe it was the Town Square.
5129000	5131940	In later versions he'd also sing at the Roost Cafe.
5132440	5141122	Now he actually has Club Lowell where he sings on Saturday nights and you listen to the song and you can get a demo version and now the stores actually sell his music.
5141582	5146783	You can also use the music as the album art on your wall as a poster.
5147603	5150004	But going back to the... Okay, here it is.
5150104	5153065	It was actually Totaka Kazumi.
5153725	5155506	So that's where Todakeke's name came from.
5157206	5162948	At any rate, the game had absolutely adorable music.
5163008	5164228	Just really neat songs.
5164268	5168430	You had all kinds of genre represented in Todakeke's music.
5170230	5173651	And then just the background music was really iconic.
5173711	5175132	I mean, to this day, I still...
5175672	5176213	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5197373	5209861	Well, I'm not going to say these are officially a collectible item, but you get the Honeywa, which we got as gyroids, which after it rained, you could dig them up in the ground because back in the old school days, Honeywa were buried with the dead.
5210521	5212882	So that's why you dig them up out of the ground.
5214303	5225009	Um, and AlphaKineticGram also wants to point out that, um, Totaka has, um, his, uh, song, which actually is in the game as K.K.
5225029	5225349	Song.
5226030	5232433	The little hidden thing that was also in Mario Paint and all the different, you know, things that he ever did sound design for.
5233654	5234294	So, um...
5235965	5237666	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5265683	5269830	You had the police dog's copper.
5270451	5271533	And what was the other one's name?
5271713	5272715	I can't remember the other one's name.
5275078	5275619	There were...
5277768	5280829	Now we have Isabelle and Digby in the newer ones.
5281669	5288771	Isabelle is your... Apparently she never sleeps because she is at the stupid town hall all the damn time.
5289492	5290932	You could change your town theme.
5291252	5292393	You could change catchphrases.
5293013	5296454	We used to make people say some really dirty ass things and Nintendo finally got smart.
5296974	5299335	Yeah, I might have been an offender with that.
5300623	5309250	Well, I've got Rowan going around wearing the Link outfit saying kitty fuck.
5309691	5313233	You know, we used to have Dina, remember Dina?
5313334	5318458	She apparently is no longer a gym teacher, but a music teacher.
5319459	5320419	She's a folk singer, Rob.
5321180	5321841	Staying with her ways.
5324443	5328028	All of your different villagers, you've got different types of personalities.
5328048	5337138	They actually brought back the big sister personality, the perky, and the friendly older brother personality that were in earlier games.
5338399	5356350	and different characters that go back and forth now the other thing with this is it is and I've mentioned this before Bobby Bobby said he made all this town people say just ignore him Halo classic game of the year it's not gonna happen he's trolling you and it's working I know but I'm just laughing at him because he's still trying and it's just not funny um
5359961	5364886	I've made Ed say I totally suck is his greeting, and then his catchphrase is I really suck.
5366408	5367249	I fucking hate Ed.
5369111	5375237	In the newer ones you've got, like, you can have a campsite where people can visit and they'll play stupid games and steal your money, fuckers.
5376158	5378079	I mean, just all kinds of stuff to do.
5379399	5383900	I mentioned the island, and I can't help it.
5384580	5386881	I've had so much fun with the first game.
5386961	5399744	Now, to bring up what I was talking about, about the dialogue, since Japanese is basically a syllabic alphabet, I picked up the GameCube one in Japanese to practice my reading.
5400624	5403386	And lo and behold, my reading actually improved.
5403426	5407910	I mean, I'm way out of practice now, but it was a very, very good educational tool.
5407930	5417257	So I'm actually offering this out here to anyone who happens to be a beginner learner who's wanting to practice your reading to understand grammar and syntax.
5417978	5420200	Basically, get Animal Crossing on GameCube.
5420360	5422521	I mean, use it to import other copies.
5423102	5426705	It will really, really, really help your reading comprehension in Japanese.
5427365	5431446	And it's not kanji heavy, so you don't have to really worry about it.
5432526	5436027	So, anyway, there's so much to do.
5436147	5437528	The original was fun.
5438268	5439208	The newer ones are fun.
5439248	5451332	I mean, they kind of got stale with City Folk and Wild World, but I think that the last one, New Leaf, really has brought back a lot of the fun that was in the game.
5451352	5455833	I mean, of course, you don't have the NES games hidden around, but it's still super fun.
5455973	5456213	I mean...
5457976	5466982	I still say though, and I said this on a previous show, but I wish they'd just develop a handful, not a lot, but a handful of very simple Flash-style games that you could unlock.
5467002	5467883	That would be a lot of fun.
5468003	5469043	Or maybe old Game & Watch.
5469764	5471945	Oh yeah, that would be cool.
5472066	5474407	Things that they don't sell at all in virtual consoles.
5474507	5478330	Until then, I will have to make myself happy by being very, very pleased.
5478390	5481112	Okay, this is the other thing I was going to mention, is that there was a full-length movie.
5482132	5487634	Um, based off it, and it actually had, as your animal characters, it had, they were all characters in the game.
5488134	5489474	And one of them lives in my village now.
5489934	5491355	In the U.S., she's Margie.
5492075	5495976	In, uh, in Japan, she's Sally, the elephant, who's like one of the main, main characters.
5496496	5501077	Lives in my village, and I found out that Actdeft has a bouquet, or Rosie in the U.S.
5501177	5501257	one.
5501898	5504518	So, it's sort of like, oh, that's cool.
5504738	5506319	It's sort of like a way to be involved.
5507019	5509320	So, anyway, um, Animal Crossing.
5509800	5510200	Lots of fun.
5510845	5512426	Animal Crossing Animal Crossing Animal Crossing
5535662	5535922	Anyway.
5536102	5538423	You know, if Bobby keeps trolling me about Halo, it's never happening.
5539643	5540543	Oh, threatening now.
5540603	5540863	All right.
5541163	5541623	Not threatening.
5541643	5542203	That's a promise.
5543724	5544004	All right.
5544864	5546124	We're going to take a quick break, guys.
5546164	5549845	When we come back, there is plenty more Orange Lounge Radio to come, including the Fugu question of the week.
5550245	5555346	Some more updates on Wii U. And Jamie, I know, is going to be excited about this release for Steam.
5555706	5558086	She will probably buy this yet again on Steam.
5558346	5559146	It's got to be that good.
5559666	5563067	We'll talk more about it when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.
5569798	5577463	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio, live on this Sunday evening, October the... What day is it today?
5577483	5578504	The somethingth.
5578524	5579204	The somethingth.
5579344	5586349	October the 6th, how about, of 2013, where our 522nd episode is in progress.
5586990	5594394	And looking at our chat room, we were playing kind of a variety of music during the break there, some mostly like Super Nintendo classics in there.
5595035	5599318	Although we did have Animal Crossing music starting it off, we did have... I played something from Chrono Trigger.
5599778	5600359	Animal Crossing for me
5623328	5623949	Well, you're welcome.
5624109	5625049	Because it makes me happy.
5625170	5629473	I miss the first game song so much.
5630214	5634898	I have a really good story about Animal Crossing, and that would be the way I actually got Animal Crossing.
5635838	5638280	Actually, Loki actually bought Animal Crossing for me.
5639461	5641703	Years ago, we were all playing DDR.
5641743	5645686	We all used to post on these local forums for Sacramento DDR players.
5646007	5647488	And I remember we were all pretty close.
5647508	5650691	I mean, there was only about maybe 20 of us that actually ever posted on these boards regularly.
5650991	5652132	But we were all a pretty close group.
5652732	5654473	This is before Facebook and any of that shit.
5654513	5656353	Maybe about the time LiveJournal was starting to boom.
5656974	5662195	And Loki was like, what would you do if you just got a big bonus at work?
5662235	5663236	What would you spend the money on?
5663276	5665197	I said, I'd get a GameCube and Animal Crossing.
5665217	5666917	And I come home from work, and what did Loki do?
5666957	5668538	He bought me a GameCube and Animal Crossing.
5668958	5669378	That was awesome.
5669438	5672139	It was one of the nicest things anyone's ever done for me.
5672279	5672999	Now we're all poor.
5673359	5676200	As much of an asshole as you are on this show sometimes, Loki.
5678141	5680843	Deep down in, he's a really nice guy, so there you go.
5681264	5685407	I told a nice story about Loki on this show, but no, I really appreciated that to this day.
5685447	5687328	That was a really awesome thing.
5687789	5692852	So hearing the music, I came home, and that was on loop, because I guess they left it powered on.
5692872	5694153	I don't even know how you got into the house.
5694173	5695875	You must have contacted my roommate at the time or something.
5696035	5696235	Yeah.
5696635	5700318	And set that all up so that when I got home from work, it was already on the TV.
5700358	5700879	It was really cool.
5701199	5701359	Yeah.
5702153	5711998	Alright, well let's get back into some rapid fire Wait, I gotta ask before we get into rapid fire news Chell, you're quite the artist over there I see you, is that crocheting over there?
5712018	5712498	What are you doing?
5712878	5715399	I am macrame-ing a frickin' belt Nice!
5715719	5730326	I'm working my way up to creepy owl I have got an entire box of old hemp and jute from this customer of my mom's She's got a yarn shop, but people tend to just drop off fibers with her So I'm like, score!
5730506	5732167	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5756380	5759443	Very... Excuse me, I'm choking on a sunflower seed.
5759503	5759964	Very nice.
5760644	5762747	Well, good luck with all of those projects.
5762787	5764408	And I like the belt you got going on so far.
5764468	5766711	It looks very intricate with the way you kind of have to tie that together.
5767471	5770334	It's my third, so it's been a steep learning curve.
5770475	5771035	Trust me.
5771095	5773197	Well, yeah, I can't even do this.
5773277	5774158	I can't even sew.
5774178	5776561	Hey, I hear the 70s are making a comeback.
5778343	5779564	It actually is looking really good.
5780191	5780792	I like it, it's cool.
5781412	5784155	Alright, you should post a picture on the Tumblr or something, one of those places.
5784695	5791801	Alright, let's get to some rapid fire news, and quickly running down a few of the fast game stories this week.
5791962	5792202	Loki.
5792782	5794624	Alright, so the Mighty No.
5794644	5798688	9 Kickstarter finally finished, and they ended up with $4 million.
5799729	5801931	And it'll be coming out on a lot of different platforms.
5802031	5802291	Spring 2015...
5804752	5809533	Let's say maybe summer 2015 because we all know how these Kickstarters are.
5810393	5815034	Xbox 360, Xbox One, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Vita, 3DS, pretty much every platform.
5815134	5815634	Everything.
5815935	5816695	Got funded for everything.
5817115	5818075	I forgot to Kickstart it.
5818675	5819415	Oh well, that's fine.
5819695	5823096	Did I not say it would get funded for everything?
5823776	5824156	No, you did.
5824256	5824836	I predicted.
5826397	5831438	I forgot they had the PayPal and that the $150,000 from the PayPal was going into the funds too.
5831858	5832558	I forgot about that.
5833098	5839764	They still may, like other Kickstarters, they still may take money via PayPal after everything's said and done.
5841145	5841465	It's fine.
5841485	5843247	I'll just wait and buy it when it comes out.
5843267	5844148	Yeah, it's spring 2015.
5844228	5846229	Fuck, why am I buying stuff that comes out in 2015?
5847430	5848271	I need the money now.
5848671	5854356	Yeah, I'm not buying stuff that comes out in 2014 yet, let alone... But thanks to everybody who funded it for me so I can buy it later.
5856297	5857938	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5881385	5881706	Maybe.
5881826	5883128	She's already building one in her house.
5883328	5889177	No, because I have a village to run.
5889297	5889798	I'm the mayor.
5890158	5892542	I'm Empress Sakura of Normandy and I don't have time for a Death Star.
5893959	5902361	This makes me think of when they did that whole, like, what's that website where you can do the White House petitions or whatever, and somebody actually asked... Whitehouse.org, maybe?
5902521	5903341	Or .gov?
5903361	5907482	I thought they had, like, a spin-off site or something where you can do the petitions specifically.
5907562	5908502	It's the .gov website.
5908662	5910162	Oh, I thought it was, like, a separate website.
5910362	5921705	I don't know if I'm looking forward to the inevitable Zynga version, you know, Killball Heights, you know, where they have, where you, you know, design your own...
5924328	5932650	Um, and then finally, you know, because there's a lot of movie, or games based on movies coming out, but we have another date for one.
5932990	5936191	Warcraft, the movie, coming to theaters December 18th, 2015.
5936231	5936531	And, yeah.
5942762	5945123	Hell, I know Need for Speed's coming out next spring.
5945923	5950145	I kind of want to see it just because it looks like a generic racing action movie.
5950365	5954107	We still don't know who's in the cast for the Warcraft movie though, just a date.
5954867	5957288	And I'm thinking like, okay, that's a placeholder date.
5957368	5964631	That's one of those Hollywood games of chess where they start to block out what movies are coming out when and get away from my movie and all that.
5966171	5969413	So don't hold fast that this will actually go through.
5970433	5971814	because it might get delayed to 2016.
5972054	5973315	It might come out earlier.
5973355	5976357	Sometimes movies come out earlier, although I doubt that because I haven't even started filming yet.
5978318	5979579	Yeah, I mean, I don't know.
5980060	5983302	I guess it starts filming next year in January, but...
5985040	5991664	I'm not really excited for it because I don't know any of the lore, so it's just like, hey, Lord of the Rings again or something.
5991804	5995546	If the movie's going to be successful, it's got to be accessible to non-Warcraft players.
5995586	5996927	It has to be all about thrall.
5998007	5998368	I don't care.
5998388	5999188	I want thrall the movie.
5999368	6003611	I think they're taking it way, well, it was supposed to be Alliance-centered, but that was an early rumor.
6003631	6005612	But Varian's a dick and no one cares.
6006252	6007253	I think it's going back.
6007353	6009634	I don't think the game is going to be based off World of Warcraft.
6009674	6012476	I think the movie is going to be based off of World of Warcraft.
6012496	6016238	I think the movie is going to be based off of Warcraft or like Warcraft 3 maybe.
6016919	6021682	Well, that's cool because then you get What's-Her-Face who I think is awesome.
6021742	6022222	Sylvanas.
6023123	6023543	That'd be cool.
6025441	6026522	Age of Ultros 2015 Independence Day 2
6045018	6046499	Oh my god, I'm so excited.
6046959	6048940	I only care about Avengers.
6049260	6054942	If it starts just like last Independence Day, I saw it was the 3rd, 4th, and 5th, I kind of want to do that again.
6055442	6056242	I hope it's terrible.
6056363	6057303	I hope it's absolutely terrible.
6057323	6059724	I hope it is absolutely god-awful and I will be there every day.
6059744	6062545	I hope Elizabeth Berkley is on the cast because that would be awesome.
6062785	6063846	Randy Quaid Ghost, Slash Zombie
6091563	6097691	The chatroom's making fun of me because apparently I had a Freudian slip and I said Age of Ultros instead of Ultron.
6098552	6106723	You know you've been playing too much Final Fantasy when... It would make for a more interesting movie, to be honest.
6107223	6107884	Yeah, it's true.
6108245	6109326	Honestly, let's be real.
6109386	6110407	It would be a better movie.
6110807	6117735	Okay, I'm pissed because, no, actually, in the Marvel comics right now, they're pushing an Age of Ultron right now.
6118316	6121540	And I think that's the only reason why the next movie is going to be Ultron.
6122501	6124283	Because it was fully set up for Thanos.
6124303	6124643	Hello.
6124924	6125544	Yeah, I know, right?
6126445	6127346	They just want to make you wait until 3.
6128348	6149686	I just thought of a tagline since we're bringing Elizabeth Berkley into the cast as she should be Independence Independence Day Everybody got independence and shit That is so obscure There's like maybe 5% of the audience if that is going to get that reference But I love you just a little bit more for making it Rob What?
6149987	6151468	Darling, you are independent
6155396	6159260	I don't know what you're doing in that jet, but it sure as hell ain't fighting aliens.
6161882	6163183	No one understands.
6163864	6164524	No one understands.
6164584	6167447	I think the people who do understand will make up for the ones that don't.
6167547	6169409	Other movies coming out in 2015.
6169509	6170149	Star Wars.
6170970	6171651	Star Wars Episode 7.
6171711	6172692	Star Wars.
6172792	6173132	Yeah.
6173172	6173232	Who?
6176868	6198617	flop movie in space no I'm kidding actually if the rumors are true that Daniel Day-Lewis is gonna be in it like that guy can like he could act the phone book and it would be amazing did you see the mock-up poster that some I think it was like a photoshopping job but it was really cool that had like the original actors and everything you know looking their age and all that as the characters would have been later on that's pretty cool
6199197	6201479	I do want drunk Carrie Fisher in the movie so bad.
6201499	6204861	That would be awesome.
6205101	6205682	Oh, man.
6205842	6206102	All right.
6206302	6207163	And also in 2015.
6207563	6209104	Sorry, I know this is rapid fire news.
6209124	6209925	I'm using my quotey fingers.
6210345	6214428	Also in 2015, let's not forget, Batfleck is in 2015.
6215769	6217130	And you know what?
6217150	6217950	Here's the thing, though.
6217990	6218491	Here's the thing.
6218511	6218531	I...
6220612	6223273	I love Batman stuff.
6223733	6228154	And my favorite Batman, honestly, is the Adam West era Batman.
6230455	6232135	Can it really get any cheesier than that?
6232315	6232895	I don't know.
6233255	6234496	Yeah, but did you see Daredevil?
6234956	6235856	That was bad.
6236216	6238277	Can it really be worse than Batman and Robin?
6238677	6240117	Can it really get any worse?
6240137	6242978	That's a good, good question because that movie was bad.
6243458	6247479	You know the only reason I saw it was because someone else paid for it and drug me along to see it.
6247853	6248473	Must be nice.
6249154	6252855	Because I wasn't going to spend any money on that and that's still two hours of my life I can't get back.
6252935	6260479	I wanted to see it because there is no way that Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr. Freeze is not going to be entertaining.
6262339	6263620	Everybody choose!
6263660	6265861	There is no way that's not going to be entertaining.
6266922	6278133	as a lifelong Batman fan I'm kind of resigned to the fact that he kind of goes in cycles you've got the goofy Adam Westing kind of thing then you got the ultra super serious reboot and then you got you know it bleeds into the Adam Westing again
6280120	6302767	I'll give it a chance because everybody hated the idea of Michael Keaton as well and he turned out to be awesome but here's the thing the original Batman was also a Tim Burton movie and then you know who was the guy that did the next trilogy why am I his name is slipping my mind right now fuck him the next guy those those movies were terrible the guy who just did these recent three oh my god bad fan
6304217	6311822	Well, I'll put it... But he proved himself, and when he cast Heath Ledger, I know a lot of people were skeptical, but I was like, no, Batman Begins was the shit.
6312022	6312803	Christopher Nolan.
6312823	6313864	Thank you, Christopher Nolan.
6314164	6315765	Batman Begins was the shit.
6316005	6317286	This guy knows what he's doing.
6317646	6318627	I will trust his judgment.
6318647	6319347	But here's the thing.
6319647	6320368	Zack Snyder?
6321729	6323350	I don't know about you, sir.
6324130	6329634	For the record, by the way, I am not going to see it because I am currently on a DC boycott.
6331247	6342397	No, I'm serious, because of how they're treating their writers for their portrayal of women in their comics, and for the whole marriage bullshit, just so that they don't have to let Batwoman get married.
6342718	6343579	Yeah, that's a little weird.
6344540	6346301	Also, their audition for a new artist.
6346341	6349524	Here, draw Harley Quinn trying to kill herself in three panels.
6349544	6351126	Sexy, underwear, sexy, you know?
6351311	6352432	DC needs some new publicists
6369542	6370222	Alright, look.
6370923	6373104	Moving on to something happy.
6373464	6375164	Much more happier and gay.
6375304	6375885	And I mean it.
6376125	6376805	I like gay.
6376945	6379846	Gamer X is returning to San Francisco.
6379946	6380607	Gamer X2.
6381447	6382527	Electric Boogaloo.
6382687	6384268	No, that's just what I think it should be called.
6384508	6385489	But it's Gamer X2.
6385929	6389670	It is going to be happening July 11th through the 13th of 2014.
6390050	6393232	They have moved to a venue that is three times as large.
6393332	6393712	Thank God.
6393812	6398834	God, Intercontinental Hotel in San Francisco, which is right next to Moscone Center, if I'm not mistaking.
6399334	6401475	And they've already announced some of the guests for it.
6401775	6414759	And also, Cards Against Humanity already signed up as a sponsor of the event, which, cross your fingers, your toes, hold your breath, that this means an exclusive GamerX set of cards, because that would be amazing.
6416400	6417901	There's also some guests they've announced.
6418021	6420443	I know that Ella McClain is coming back.
6421925	6422805	What's Sniper's name?
6423466	6425327	John Mowry, is that his name?
6425387	6425587	Sorry.
6426348	6428109	He'll be back this year.
6428170	6428850	They're coming back.
6429070	6438698	And apparently, the couple that got engaged at GamerX1, and the video's huge, viral all over the internet, they're going to get married at GamerX2.
6438798	6442161	And they're actually sent, like, everybody's getting little wedding invitations.
6442261	6443662	I want to go and throw flowers.
6444162	6444482	Right?
6444583	6445103	Who doesn't?
6445443	6446304	So this is going to be fun.
6446344	6452869	And all I have to say, and I want to give a shout out right now to my folks in the gay podcasting circle.
6452969	6454590	We got Game Bar.
6454670	6457332	We got GameBooey.org.
6457372	6458713	We got Koopa Club.
6459094	6463417	We got Video Game Realness and so much more out there.
6464197	6492281	I know there's plans to do something podcast cross zone 2 but like bigger, better and it's going to have to be with all these extra people that now want to be a part of it which is a great thing I mean what a horrible situation to be in it's too popular of an event I want to go you can get your tickets now but if you can't get them right now because of financial whatever they'll be on sale until they're not we need to do a panel it'll be fun, I think we should let's do a panel
6492762	6493202	It'll be fun.
6493963	6494663	Alright, we'll talk.
6494803	6495504	We'll get to talking.
6496144	6498626	Anyhow, GamerX.com if you want more information on that.
6499026	6501908	Information on Rocksmith 2014 edition.
6502048	6505110	Adding some more songs to kind of round out their song list.
6505770	6517017	Rocksmith 2014 edition will include Deaf Leopards, Pour Some Sugar On Me, Queen's We Are The Champions, and Mary Jane's Last Dance from Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers.
6517357	6518498	Ooh, and a song for Bobby.
6518638	6521400	Rush is going to be in the game with The Spirit of Radio.
6521980	6548523	I love Rush Rush is Canada's best export I still love Alanis Morissette that's the 90s kid in me but anyway some disagree with me but deal with it there's lots of great songs in the game I'm not going to read the entire song list but remember that Rocksmith is like the no really stop hitting plastic buttons and learn how to play an actual guitar so you know if you want to go to guitar school Rocksmith 2014 is the way to do it also there's what's called colorblind mode which I think is pretty cool
6549743	6551624	One of the producers is actually colorblind.
6552144	6559027	And you can actually adjust the hues and the color saturation levels throughout the entire game to be a little better for the colorblind.
6559347	6562088	Because I guess the first game got a little flack for it.
6562228	6564589	So they are going to make it a little better this time around.
6564629	6566049	So kudos for accessibility.
6566710	6571411	And lastly, coming to an arcade near you.
6571891	6573392	Yes, an arcade near you.
6573968	6583471	Plants vs. Zombies The Last Stand I'm assuming they turned Plants vs. Zombies into a ticket spitter because that's all arcade games are anymore.
6584132	6587153	Yeah, it is a video redemption product.
6587193	6588133	Yes, yes, of course.
6589213	6590594	There's already a bejeweled one.
6590894	6591454	That surprised me.
6591474	6593115	I've never seen one of those, but I guess that is out there.
6593135	6598137	But yes, look for more information on Plants vs. Zombies coming to an arcade near you soon.
6598857	6599277	DarkSakura.
6600382	6603943	We're actually having a small discussion in chat, by the way.
6604623	6606824	There needs to be the Jessica Jones TV show.
6607164	6607844	I'm going to cry.
6608964	6610025	Have you been watching S.H.I.E.L.D.
6610065	6610305	at all?
6610565	6611785	No, and I need to.
6612425	6613286	I need to, too.
6613306	6616446	But Jessica Jones is my favorite Marvel character ever.
6617047	6620568	And if none of you have read Alias, which had nothing to do with the TV show, read it.
6620828	6621648	Well, if S.H.I.E.L.D.
6621688	6628770	goes anything like another ABC show once upon a time, they will roll out those characters just to make you watch.
6629246	6630468	Now they have their spin-off series.
6630488	6631289	Yeah, they have the spin-off.
6631309	6632931	They just released a picture of Jafar.
6633031	6634854	Apparently, for some reason, he's in Wonderland.
6634894	6639340	I'm not even going to try and figure that one out, but it's just like, you know, who can we roll out next?
6640121	6641163	Yeah, Chell, what did you want to say?
6642631	6643912	Yeah, the character thing.
6644032	6654158	I was, you know, I started watching Once Upon a Time as kind of my trashy show and then I got emotionally involved and then it jumped the shark like, whoa.
6654378	6658201	And I'm just, I'm basically watching it out of train wreck syndrome.
6658241	6662544	So yeah, I hadn't heard about Jafar, but now I need to check out the freaking Alice in Wonderland.
6662664	6664205	Well, here's the thing.
6664685	6670889	Even, I'm not really watching Once Upon a Time, but it is like next on my list once I finish off Scandal, which is far more important.
6671349	6675411	But even I've seen the pictures of Captain Hook.
6676052	6677533	And that is... Oh, yeah.
6677633	6678513	That's, yeah.
6678553	6683096	You know, I said, you know, not even Robert Carlyle can get me back for the third series.
6683156	6683816	They got me back.
6686638	6687499	All right, moving on.
6687519	6694503	For my rapid fire news, there's... I am getting so sick of these websites that are not iPad compatible.
6694723	6695183	Uh-ohs.
6696044	6696444	Fuck them.
6697548	6706410	This actually is called the Not On Steam Sale, which I'm trying to give you guys some advertising, but your site's not working on my iPad, so why should I?
6707330	6710850	Basically, it's about 66 games that are not on Steam.
6710950	6726313	They're all by indie developers that are for sale at notonsteam.com Supermarkdown, there's some really cool stuff like Girls Like Robots, Photonica, Uzi Earth Adventure, One Finger Death Punch, which actually I think is now on Steam.
6726573	6727474	What's Pushcat?
6729335	6730316	That one I haven't checked out.
6730796	6732077	There's one called Rose in Time.
6732097	6734359	There's scanning a truck driving simulator.
6734840	6736881	Six Sided Sanctuary looked like a fun one.
6736921	6737982	I almost bought that one.
6738422	6741585	The Sea Will Claim Everything, Tiny Barbarian DX.
6742145	6743446	Lots of really neat games on there.
6743527	6744808	And there's also Alphas.
6744908	6746209	There's another game on here, by the way.
6746669	6747950	It's called We'll Fight for Food.
6748991	6749331	Nice.
6749812	6751453	Oh, this one called Spud's Quest looks cute.
6752062	6754085	Yeah, there's just a lot of neat looking games on there.
6754245	6754466	Nice.
6755447	6756950	And in a not so indie game.
6758552	6759754	We all like Borderlands, don't we?
6761053	6770140	Well, 2K and Gearbox have $100,000 worth of prizes for an in-game loot hunt for Borderlands 2.
6770240	6781789	So basically on October 11th at 10 Eastern Time, the game will be altered so that these weird guns are going to start dropping in odd places.
6782450	6786433	So the Knuckle Dragger will drop on Gwen's head.
6787974	6788495	Oh, no, sorry.
6788515	6790116	The Knucklejagger will drop Gwen's head.
6790176	6790857	My apologies.
6791857	6796681	So, basically, you fulfill their little requirements and you could win a prize.
6797582	6799884	I will not tell you any more about it because you need to go check it out yourself.
6800964	6815015	And then, last but not least, there is a new Sonic game in development for Xbox One and PS4 and Wii U. And I believe it's just a working title, Sonic Thunderstorm or Sonic Blue Thunder.
6816118	6819239	uh... there is uh... a uh...
6821016	6834823	Looks like there's going to be a new character named Static the Hedgehog and a teenage clone of Sonic, Knuckles, Rogue, Eggman will also have teenage clones and Knuckles' clone will be called Slash the Echidna.
6835103	6836564	Hooray, more shitty friends.
6836744	6839105	Static the Hedgehog, he doesn't move very much.
6839385	6841126	He's very placement.
6841406	6842627	He's a pretty clingy friend.
6842647	6846949	You can also play as Tails, Amy, Debra, all these other characters.
6847709	6850491	And you also have Team Chaotix, which is all that I care about.
6851531	6856554	29 levels, different objects, return of old animals and chaos drives, and the Chao Garden.
6857534	6861576	Gameplay will change characters like in Sonic Heroes.
6861916	6862896	It's just a bunch of stuff.
6862936	6863917	I don't know if it's going to be any good.
6864317	6866178	But there is the return of the Chaos Emeralds.
6867338	6870940	Yes, but what mode allows me to make them act out my fan fictions?
6872839	6873179	None.
6873539	6874080	Sit down.
6874600	6883945	They're also saying that Wi-Fi will transfer Chao data and you have a Chao garden for it will be DLC and available on PS Vita and 3DS.
6886343	6887684	So, yay.
6887844	6889224	It better not suck.
6889264	6889944	Yeah, let's be real.
6889984	6891725	Let's hope this is a good Sonic game.
6891925	6892265	I know, right?
6892285	6894946	Don't they kind of alternate back and forth like Star Trek movies?
6895126	6895586	Yeah.
6896027	6900868	Except that doesn't apply to the Star Trek re-releases.
6901689	6903309	The revamps.
6904029	6905030	Because both of them have been good.
6905950	6908491	I think the first one was way better than the second one, but that's just me.
6908771	6909211	That's just me.
6909231	6909571	All right.
6910292	6910932	Womp womp.
6911437	6916761	All right, let's get to the Fugle Question of the Week.
6917341	6922785	And every week we ask our listeners a question on Facebook and Google+.
6923926	6926648	You put that together and you get Fugle, the Fugle Question of the Week.
6926728	6930211	And this week, as I promised, it's going to be all about Pokemon.
6930271	6934694	So we asked our listeners the most important question possibly of the millennium.
6936059	6939601	Are you Team Fennekin, Chespin, or Froakie?
6940121	6947284	And for those that don't know, Loki, those are the starter Pokemon in the new X and Y. They're like Bulbasaur.
6947304	6948584	What about option 14?
6948624	6949345	Don't give a fuck.
6949705	6950125	Sit down.
6950145	6950465	Shut up.
6950805	6953306	Well, actually, I did ask as part of the question.
6953667	6956508	Pokemon Mania looks to be starting all over again in just a week.
6956648	6957948	What do you think of Pokemon?
6958048	6959389	Are you picking up X and Y?
6959889	6963631	Or are you shocked at the number of grown adults who obsess over Pokemon?
6964171	6984726	So let's go to Google Plus first, where Actdeft says Team Fennekin, and then he gives us a link to a community on LiveJournal called Pokemon Collectors, talking about his second question, and I see that there's two 3DSs, stuffed animals, yeah, Actdeft might have a problem, but that's okay.
6985444	6986184	We still like you.
6986685	6994848	He says, seriously though, I've been a Pokemon fan since the red, blue, yellow days, and I don't see leaving the Pokemon games and fan amenities time soon.
6994888	7003832	I'm so hyped for X and Y. Jim, or excuse me, Flaco Jones says, despite my love of RPGs, I never got into Pokemon in the first place.
7004332	7008394	Now when they come out with a game, it seems like they just expand on old stuff to make the fans happy.
7008774	7014937	A new Pokemon release has never said to me, hey, you've never played this before, but this version will really pull you into the series.
7015497	7030188	to be fair I think they're trying to do that with X and Y a little bit one thing I noticed about the three starter Pokemon is that their final forms kind of fall into the fighter, mage, thief kind of generalisms you expect in RPGs I found that interesting
7031168	7060565	uh Evel uh which might be pronounced that way or E3VL I'm not sure but uh Evel responds and says I'm only purchasing one version of the game this time around why seeing the diverse age groups who enjoy the franchise I hope the creators make the plot more complex or adult oriented so that varying age demographics may have a more meaningful discussion while playing the game together well yeah but it's Pokemon I mean how deep is it gonna get just saying just saying my my personal opinion all right going over to Facebook for some answers um
7062506	7080651	Sial says I'm looking to team Froakie closely followed by team Fennekin and I'm picking up Y as soon as I can get into the evil G to get it as for what I think of the Pokemon series Yellow was the first game that I actually owned so they hold a place in my heart and gaming library which reminds me I need to make an attempt at figuring out what is wrong with my copy of Yellow
7081551	7089300	Shane replied, and Shane is Team Chespin, and I've been counting down the days since January, which is when they announced the games, but had no release dates.
7089941	7091743	This is the most important release this year.
7092083	7093084	It is already my game of 2013.
7094566	7097369	You sound like Loki talking about a different game just a few weeks ago.
7098390	7106033	Um, JV Mon replies and says, Team Froakie, I've never chosen a non-water starter ever since I chose Squirtle and Pokemon Blue.
7106473	7111414	Now my only decision is between X and Y. Lucky I have both reserved so I can decide on release day.
7111814	7113875	Pokemon will always be a go-to game for me.
7113955	7116096	Sure, the structure's predictable, but that's part of the charm.
7116936	7134377	for the Fallen Dreams says Team Fennekin motherfuckers I'm 22 and Pokemon will never get old to me it's hands down the best handheld RPG in my opinion it's the sole reason I'm getting a 3DS minus a few other titles it's a breath of fresh air from the constant gore and violence from more adult oriented video games
7134958	7155824	Clover N says my wife and I have pre-ordered an X and a Y I always choose water type and my wife always chooses grass type and uh let's see uh going to the next answer Burr says Fennekin all the way I'll see if I can pick it up I haven't actually finished a Pokemon game yet though I got the furthest in blue when I when I first flirted with it during my freshman year of college
7157672	7159955	Tim Tripp replied and said, gonna have to go with Chespin.
7160396	7164361	I don't obsess over Pokemon, but there is a lot about it that is surprisingly compelling.
7164721	7168526	I don't play every generation because the changes have always been a bit too incremental.
7168886	7174614	From the looks of it, XY has made some significant forward steps without changing the core of what makes Pokemon fun.
7174774	7175855	So I'll be picking up a copy.
7176636	7180259	Matt J says, I've yet to decide on my starter, so can't commit to a team yet.
7180819	7183281	I'm not surprised at all that so many adults are into Pokemon.
7183301	7184922	I'm nearly 29 and still love it.
7185242	7188964	However, you think folks around my age were kids when the first Pokemon games came out.
7189345	7191486	I was only 13 when Red and Blue came out here.
7191826	7193467	Many of us adults grew up on the series.
7193848	7196289	It made a mark on us, a mark that sticks with us to this day.
7197010	7199231	Geovidea says, I don't even have a 3DS yet.
7199531	7201052	Hoping for it as a holiday gift.
7201473	7201973	Hint, hint.
7203334	7204695	And I always pick fire types.
7204755	7206116	It's all about the burn.
7207076	7209598	Andy R says, I got pretty bored with the last few games.
7209638	7210739	I didn't even finish White.
7211180	7215143	I'm still considering buying X or Y, but it'll probably depend more on how many of my friends pick it up.
7215443	7217905	Am I shocked at grown adults obsessing over Pokemon?
7218105	7218305	No.
7218425	7219806	Nostalgia is a powerful force.
7220607	7222669	Fifth Dream says, Froakie all the way.
7222769	7227552	I always pick water type starters, unless I'm playing a second game in a generation, then I pick a grass.
7228013	7234638	I even bought a Team Froakie t-shirt to wear when I go pick up my copy of Pokemon X. I'm 39 years old.
7234938	7237481	So I am one of those grown adults who love Pokemon.
7237821	7242767	I've played it since Blue came out and have played every single generation, some twice, and the spinoffs.
7242887	7243928	So yeah, Pokemon's great.
7244709	7247372	Ragenator says, I'm on team who gives a fuck.
7247773	7248493	Finally an answer.
7248513	7249234	Well, I mean, we haven't...
7249975	7258760	We haven't had anyone yet say, I don't care, but here's Ragenator to break that trend saying, I'm not getting Pokemon X and Y. I've yet to buy any Pokemon game.
7258780	7259701	I'm not going to start now.
7260061	7266985	Pokemon is about as interesting as being repeatedly anal probed by aliens nonstop for six months, followed by swimming in raw sewage.
7267065	7267845	You're nasty.
7267926	7268606	You're nasty.
7268806	7270928	I'm with Team Froakie because it rhymes with Loki.
7270948	7271128	Alright.
7271148	7271288	Alright.
7295994	7302057	Anyway, I'm not at all surprised that so many adults play these games because they want to rub it in the faces of six-year-olds.
7302177	7305459	I mean, to dominate six-year... I mean, I really mean... Never mind, I give it up.
7306859	7315263	Our pal Wicked from the Nerdgasm Network says, I've been out of the Pokemon Fold since Emerald, and given how XY looks like a pseudo-reboot, it looks like it's time to get back in.
7315704	7322167	I'm glad that we're finally getting a game that looks like the anime, and while the Pokemon count is utterly, nutterly, butterly...
7323227	7325409	I still think there's a lot to be had in collecting them all.
7325729	7330553	To collect them all, I'm going for Froakie because Greninja looks sick as hell.
7330873	7336338	Plus, I'll have a Firestarter from the Torchic special event and I can never say no to having a Bulbasaur.
7336358	7337759	A well-rounded team, ahoy.
7338600	7342103	Hitstun says, at the moment, I think I'm getting Pokemon X and starting with Chespin.
7342623	7351930	Once the game's been out for a week and we know more about the popular Pokemon and how to counterpick them, I'll be ready to delete my save, start again, and work towards my ideal team from the beginning.
7352751	7357612	I already pre-ordered Pokemon Blue 15 years ago, but I skipped Generations 3 and 5 completely.
7357972	7363173	Building a good competitive team is a lot of work, but it's worth it when the game is new and my friends are playing it too.
7363793	7367674	SSJ100Matt says, Pokemon came out in 1998 and I've been playing it since then.
7367754	7371715	I'm almost 30, which means I have played Pokemon for half my life.
7372235	7374276	I will get Pokemon Y when I finish Black 2.
7374956	7375236	Sigh.
7375996	7377197	and lastly, Codeman.
7377858	7379339	I'm not sure about Pokemon.
7379720	7384745	I loved Blue and Red, but I just can't add to it the huge amount of games I will have on the table already.
7385185	7388448	I will be picking up a 2DS, so maybe then I'll try it for now.
7388708	7389349	Probably not.
7389970	7392072	But I was a huge fan of the Pokemon anime.
7392232	7393153	It was fantastic.
7393653	7400741	So, overwhelming Pokemon fans versus non-Pokemon fans there.
7402343	7403144	And kind of even.
7403184	7405867	It sounded pretty even on who's picking up what starter.
7406327	7411273	I will say this, that for all the past ones that I have played, I've always started with a Fire-type.
7411613	7411893	Okay.
7412434	7413035	That's just been me.
7413095	7414577	Fennekin's super cute.
7414617	7418561	Oh, and to answer the question earlier in the show, I am Team Fennekin.
7418781	7419342	Absolutely.
7419823	7421404	I have no idea what that is.
7422105	7425389	He's a little Firefox, not to be confused with a popular web browser.
7425449	7427892	Okay, well, if he's a fox and on fire, maybe I have to get the game.
7428970	7429711	Let me show you.
7429731	7430931	Does it like fire?
7432272	7434173	Oh my god, that's fucking cute.
7434733	7435013	Right?
7436234	7436774	That's Fennekin.
7436794	7438155	Let me show you the others just to compare.
7438175	7442377	Do you remember when we went to that E3 and I came back with all those damn Pokemon plushies?
7443097	7444358	Like the plus and minus.
7444938	7446499	That's Chespin, the grass type.
7447039	7447900	Oh, he looks angry.
7448818	7449779	and that particular picture he does.
7449819	7450920	Here's a happy chess pin.
7451140	7452381	Oh, here's a happy chess pin.
7452401	7452761	There you go.
7453361	7457544	And here is Froakie.
7457704	7458765	Looking that up right now.
7459285	7460106	Ew, no one gives a shit.
7462087	7462908	Okay, so we know.
7462928	7466330	It looks like an old, like a frog with a beard on his back.
7466710	7469152	Okay, so Jamie is definitely not Team Froakie.
7472180	7474601	I gave them to my friend, Julie, because I don't care.
7492327	7492547	All right.
7492567	7492607	So...
7518812	7519312	Layoffs.
7520173	7523454	God, you don't like them, but it happens.
7523534	7525635	So there's a couple companies laying off people.
7525715	7529717	First off, Sega of America is confirming an unspecific number of layoffs.
7529797	7535780	I'm assuming this is tying in with the fact that they are taking on Atlus, and perhaps there's just...
7538262	7540443	Some of those jobs kind of overlapping each other.
7542124	7551649	So basically, as the gaming industry continues to evolve, companies must adapt and adjust in order to compete and succeed in an ever-changing environment.
7551869	7563756	As a result, Sega of America has recently undergone a restructure that will enable the company to focus efficiently on developing new and existing content across digital platforms as well as continuing to focus on key brands for packaged goods.
7566192	7571417	Capcom Europe will be laying off more than half of its staff.
7585228	7599218	and this is coming from I guess MCV who understands more than they're saying more than half of the arm faces redundancy with the number of jobs set to merge so that kind of sucks
7600238	7602801	and I guess following a restructure in the U.S.
7602881	7612189	operation, Capcom Europe Organization is currently evaluating its structure to ensure it's in the best position to take advantage of the changing market condition the industry is facing.
7612209	7624000	In other words, they're doing more digital stuff, I believe, because I think a lot of their... I mean, they have franchises, but there's not a ton of different franchises that they're kind of continually putting out games for.
7625882	7628785	Well, and just to say, I want to address something, too, I see around the internet.
7628805	7635612	For those that are saying, like, you know, good, or that'll teach Capcom, or, you know, Capcom deserved it, or whatever.
7636032	7637394	Like, okay, stop.
7637774	7638155	Stop.
7638475	7638815	Stop.
7638955	7641198	Because the people being affected by these layoffs...
7641738	7644219	probably have nothing to do with the decisions that you don't like.
7644819	7652241	You know, that's the way these things go, unfortunately, is that the people that are actually getting laid off are probably pretty hardworking people that are just trying to make a good game.
7652662	7654642	And usually these types of decisions come from high up.
7654662	7656303	It's when you see the CEOs being laid off.
7656323	7657443	Exactly.
7657463	7660944	Then you can start saying that, you know, well, maybe it's for the best or whatever.
7661044	7664025	So, yeah, I just kind of wanted to get that out there.
7664085	7668187	Like, don't be all like, well, should have made the new Mega Man game because that's...
7670008	7675175	I mean, while that may be true, that's like laughing at somebody's face when they're going through tragedy.
7675336	7678300	Did you see what the new Mega Man game was going to look like?
7678560	7681905	Remember the leaked footage that came out of the cancelled Mega Man game?
7682345	7683267	Yeah.
7683347	7684889	Well, the 3DS one didn't look bad at all.
7685109	7689313	Yeah, well, too bad not enough people downloaded the demo.
7689413	7690555	Or wait, they didn't release that.
7690655	7691215	No, they didn't.
7692737	7696100	But not enough people downloaded the demo because they never released it.
7696401	7700985	Yeah, but are these layoff news about the people that made that decision?
7701065	7701666	Probably not.
7702176	7702716	Thanks for watching!
7717464	7722329	I have a story that's hopefully a little bit happier news.
7723810	7732217	Ever since we saw Sony do this with the PlayStation 3 and the PlayStation Vita, we've wondered if Nintendo might do something similar, and that is cross-buy play.
7733158	7737301	Which on PlayStation 3 is awesome, because who doesn't like more games for more systems for free?
7737922	7746168	Games like Sound Shapes and Zen Pinball 2, they have the cross-play available, or if you buy it on the PlayStation 3, you get a copy for the Vita as well.
7746588	7754374	Well, it was questioned of Dan Adleman, who is a manager of business development at Nintendo, will there be something about cross-buy?
7754774	7760178	And quote, we don't have anything new to announce on that, but I believe that the idea has been talked about.
7760578	7789572	so if it's something we're definitely up to considering so it's something we're definitely up to considering that's not a non-committal answer I don't know what it is if there's enough demand from developers but nothing to announce for right now so that's interesting this will work in nicely when we announce our you know the brand new technology that we're putting in place to play 3DS games on the Wii U because then you'll buy your 3DS game and play it on your Wii U or on your 3DS because that's totally gonna fucking happen someday it might
7790894	7799052	it's not a might it's an inevitability it's just gonna happen and then cross by all the things but I can see where they might make that decision leave it up to developers though
7801235	7806419	A developer has a right to double dip what they want, even if we don't like it and don't want to support it.
7807019	7813063	Well, a lot of time also with the 3DS and the Wii U version, it's going to be two different developers on it.
7813083	7818847	Because you have developers that do the handheld ports of games, and then you'll have the console developers doing that.
7818927	7822109	Sometimes it's the same team, but a lot of times it can be two separate teams.
7822169	7823290	So, you know, it's...
7824864	7834144	why would you want to give something away for free considering that they're probably selling plenty of 3DS games and they need to sell more Wii U games so I don't know
7835152	7845096	Tiger Claw in chat says, what if they take cross by a step further, speaking on the Sony side now, buy the PlayStation 4 version and you get not only the Vita version, but the PS3 version too.
7845816	7847677	Well, we don't know enough about the Gaikai thing.
7847757	7851318	It doesn't sound like it's going to be there at launch and if it will do the PlayStation 3 games.
7852239	7854319	So I don't think we can assume that yet, but I...
7856440	7856660	DarkSakura
7878368	7887627	We do have some other gaming news We have a game that I'm not any good at
7888584	7889745	My husband's pretty good at it.
7890526	7893748	A lot of people are bitching about this, too, and I'll tell you why in a second.
7894489	7903656	But Ikaruga has hit the green light, so Treasure's wonderful shooter game is going to be out for Steam.
7904496	7911441	And apparently, though, while it's based off the Xbox 360 version, it is...
7914036	7917117	Going to have, I think, some different patterns from what I understand.
7917637	7921418	So basically people who had the old patterns memorized will have to learn new patterns all over again.
7923419	7927640	So there's also a statement that came from Treasure on Twitter.
7928000	7929060	This is new challenge.
7929120	7931561	We are trying to distribute Treasure games on Steam.
7931981	7933902	So maybe we'll get Radiant Silvergun next.
7934922	7935262	Who knows?
7937763	7938103	All right.
7938487	7940669	It seems weird they have to go through Steam Greenlight.
7940729	7941729	I mean, it's Treasure.
7941849	7943991	Why can't they just put the game on Steam?
7944251	7946092	Why did they have to go through the Greenlight process?
7947013	7955638	Maybe I'm not being fair here or whatever, but it just seems like Treasure would be a big enough name that they kind of get to cut ahead for a game like Ikaruga.
7956359	7961922	Maybe they're also thinking we might get something like Silhouette Mirage or Troublemakers.
7962143	7963944	Maybe they want to see what kind of support they're getting, too.
7964623	7968607	I think Greenlight actually is a really good way to gauge support because you have that whole voting system.
7969568	7969888	True.
7970148	7974572	Maybe they don't want to put the effort if there's not going to be enough people clamoring for it.
7974852	7976554	But Ikaruga has been popular enough.
7976694	7981118	I would love to have an accessible home version of Radiant Silvergun.
7981378	7982439	That would be amazing.
7984215	7984896	All right, let's move on.
7985416	7985696	All right.
8001671	8003853	It can be used in advertising.
8004293	8012359	For example, they're saying that SenseConnect actually recognizes expressions and engagement or can recognize people's faces.
8014421	8020025	That they can tell who's actually watching the ad or start targeting ads towards people and stuff.
8020745	8036093	Hey, listen, just because it could be used in that, some of the new Xbox One Connect fixtures could be used in advertising since we see expressions, engagement, etc., and how that might be used to target advertising.
8036814	8039915	This is the point that seems to draw some controversy.
8039975	8041756	First, nobody is working on that.
8042156	8046859	I'm not aware of any activity or any active work in this space.
8047199	8053164	Second, if something like that ever happened, you can be sure that it wouldn't happen without the user having control over it.
8053585	8054145	Period.
8054806	8057048	As he emphasized.
8060296	8074145	Yeah, but at the same time, there's also all this controversy going on with the NSA and how they're talking about people being spied on and Microsoft is the first to jump on board with supporting that kind of stuff or complying with that.
8074165	8089896	When we first talked about the mandatory Kinect thing, when all that E3 shit blew up, I said, what a horrible time, I think we all said, what a horrible time for this to be happening with all the NSA stuff that's coming to light right now because that all also happened over the summer and it's like, this is not going to help Microsoft's case.
8090736	8092057	to make the Kinect mandatory.
8092497	8094718	So, I mean, that thing needs to work.
8094758	8098079	And haven't they come out since and said, it'll be fine if you unplug your Kinect?
8098260	8099920	They won 80 on that point, didn't they?
8100260	8100741	Yeah, they did.
8101101	8103862	And honestly, I don't see this as a huge problem.
8103942	8112666	I mean, I haven't really gotten a good peek at the interface and stuff, but I'm assuming it's very similar to how the 360 is, where you have those tiny little...
8113986	8119869	Let's be honest, there's a lot of fucking ads on the 360 dashboard that really probably don't need to be there.
8120149	8120870	I mean, come on.
8121290	8131615	Microsoft's been collecting money for these internet services and stuff, and don't give me that, oh, sorry, we need this extra ad revenue to cloud things or something.
8131695	8132356	I don't know, whatever.
8133936	8140980	But I just don't see the point that we need to have even ad people make these interactive connect ads or something, because...
8141540	8143021	Who the fuck is really going to play that?
8143542	8146644	Or actually, you know, half the people don't watch those ads anyways.
8146884	8151507	And who's going to really want to see an ad where like, oh, hey, throw the mountain, do it.
8151667	8153128	You know, Jeff Gershman or whatever.
8155090	8162155	So I just... Jason in chat, VXJSXV in chat says, God, get over the fucking NSA.
8162635	8166478	Which, you know, despite all that political hubbaloo stuff,
8167098	8172819	It's not that, honestly, it's not really that that concerns me about the mandatory Kinect, but just like, you know, the Kinect has the voice commands and everything, right?
8172899	8182581	I just, whether legit or not, I am paranoid that that thing would capture a really unflattering picture in an inopportune moment or something.
8182961	8187482	Or, you know, those things are going to be able to broadcast online and call people with voice commands and stuff.
8187502	8190303	So it's like, hey, I recognize Rob has the Mountain Dew in front of him.
8190323	8190943	I'm going to take a picture.
8191043	8194204	Look, he's doing the Dew with underwear on.
8196544	8198906	The listeners, thank you for that visual, Loki.
8199847	8208372	But no, for real, my plan all along was just to turn the Kinect to face the wall when I'm not playing.
8210194	8216358	That's what I do with my current Kinect, is just turn and face the TV, or turn around the other way when I'm not playing, and it's none the wiser.
8216658	8218179	Throw a shirt on it like Poltergeist.
8218359	8219020	Right, yes!
8219460	8220561	That's a great answer, too.
8220741	8223503	And then the Kinect's like, hello, are you still there?
8225424	8226225	There you are.
8227726	8228566	Advertisements!
8243399	8244680	is the stick figure room box.
8245281	8248404	These people are really skinny and made of popsicle sticks.
8248624	8253849	Like put like Halloween full people sitting on my couch.
8254630	8257713	So the Connect thing, somebody sitting on my couch 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
8258314	8259976	That somebody literally died on my couch.
8260216	8260716	You know what?
8261657	8265421	You gotta put a blow up doll on your couch so that that's all it sees.
8265881	8266102	Wow.
8267839	8268239	DarkSakura.com
8289332	8291873	Half-Life 3 was trademarked in Europe this week.
8292373	8293273	That's right.
8293593	8298955	The Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market or whatever that is in the European Union.
8299315	8300135	Forgive my ignorance.
8300155	8302656	That's just an overseas agency.
8303496	8307497	Trademarked Half-Life 3 this week being owned by Valve Corporation.
8307797	8309958	The trademark covers computer game software.
8309978	8311518	It was filed on September 29th.
8311598	8313079	Blah, blah, blah, blah.
8313239	8313459	But...
8314119	8315560	It was fake, y'all.
8316181	8318783	As sometimes happens with the trademarks.
8319543	8320824	This was a fake.
8321224	8323746	It was therefore removed from the trademark.
8323846	8326348	It was actually a part of the actual website or whatever.
8327549	8329530	The entrant disappeared completely.
8330131	8332613	And, yeah, it's not there anymore.
8332633	8333714	Is this what we've come down to?
8333734	8336315	I mean, has the hype train gone this far off the rails?
8336335	8337536	Trolling with fake trademarks.
8337576	8339097	Oh, same thing happened to World of Warcraft.
8339158	8340839	Just, you know, same thing happens over there.
8341319	8341459	So...
8342640	8343101	Whatever.
8343821	8344362	You know what?
8344782	8347204	When Valve's ready, they'll fucking say something.
8347625	8350968	Tell them it's happening soon.
8355194	8358295	300 opportunities to get a really nice PC in your house.
8359216	8359796	That's right.
8359856	8360977	That's the way I'm looking at it.
8361737	8362397	All right, we'll see.
8362417	8364278	If it plays Half-Life 3, hey, I guess that's a bonus.
8364318	8364638	Hey, Rob.
8364998	8365218	Hey.
8365499	8366939	It's a thing.
8367660	8368100	Yes, it is.
8368640	8370061	All right, let's get to the mailbag.
8370141	8375143	Every week, you kids email us mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.
8375903	8381386	And DarkSakura dives in the email bag head first and picks out a few of her favorite emails to read for you.
8381406	8384507	Why do you have to tell everyone to send all those emails?
8384867	8385427	We'll see you next time.
8403857	8406139	So I am super excited about Beyond Two Souls.
8406239	8413726	I loved Heavy Rain despite its flaws, and from what I've played in the demos so far, this game seems to have corrected a lot of the issues people complained about in that first game.
8414387	8420012	I wanted to talk about playing the game via this app called Beyond Touch.
8420713	8421333	Sounds kinky.
8422882	8423463	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8444861	8446023	Do you think this could backfire?
8446904	8449648	I guess it depends on which experience is the better one.
8450028	8452772	Because I can see gamers getting upset, but don't they always?
8453032	8455896	If the traditional controller play is inferior to the app play.
8456477	8459300	Or is this just good business sense and would you like to see more games do this?
8459441	8461023	Thanks for all the great shows, Flacco Jones.
8462055	8462936	I think it's a good idea.
8463016	8465239	I think gamers are going to be pissed off anyway, so it doesn't matter.
8466801	8470165	I think the point is the bottom line, making the money.
8470865	8472267	Making the money means selling the game.
8472307	8474109	Selling the games make it accessible to more people.
8475010	8475591	So there you go.
8476111	8476652	That's my thought.
8476977	8486520	And also making these sort of apps and stuff that work with games and things are basically just a way to get people to talk about said game as we just did.
8486800	8489321	It works very well for MMOs too.
8489521	8493262	You know, like having the Warcraft app is a great example.
8493302	8496323	You can actually chat to your guildmates from the Warcraft app on the phone.
8496363	8497824	It's like you can actually still be in the game.
8499064	8500265	while you're not playing the game.
8501345	8503906	And there's been calls to make that enrichment even stronger.
8504486	8506226	But even non-MMO games had it.
8506266	8510447	Mass Effect had that little companion app that meant you didn't have to do multiplayer if you didn't want to.
8510467	8512008	Which I still sometimes use.
8512268	8513848	That reminds me... It's off the store, by the way.
8514049	8514709	It's officially gone.
8514969	8515549	Yeah, I heard that.
8515749	8525912	That reminds me, since Microsoft came out with this wonderful app called Smart Glass last year as part of the Xbox 360 thing, and it's something that's going to be included in the Xbox One...
8526112	8528873	Have they even shown anything that uses that yet?
8529213	8539037	Have they shown anything that's gonna, you know... I think they were talking about enhancements for Xbox One, but as far as the 360's concerned, I think it's a lost cause.
8539057	8540978	I understand that, but I'm talking about the Xbox One.
8541018	8543119	Have they even shown anything Smart Glass does?
8543479	8547241	I mean, other than mention it, like, hey, these games are gonna use Smart Glass.
8547981	8552582	I know we've seen stuff with Watch Dogs and stuff like that, but they have their own dedicated apps for that thing.
8553042	8556984	It's not really Smart Glass, it's kind of this other thing.
8558384	8562945	Yeah, I thought the Halo 4 Smart Glass thing was great until I was like, oh, it's just another app in the store?
8562965	8564265	Alright, whatever.
8564305	8573008	I think it's meant more for movies, like being a second screen experience in movies and TV, but
8574168	8574669	Oh, we'll see.
8574969	8580856	I will admit, TV on the Wii U is kind of neat, and it's a bummer more people don't use it.
8581277	8589367	It's kind of a neat little second screen experience where you can kind of chat with people as big shows are happening and stuff, but it would be neat if there was something like that on Xbox, but I don't know.
8589467	8589787	We'll see.
8589807	8592070	All right, next email?
8592811	8592951	Yes.
8593908	8595749	Hey OLR, it's your friendly neighborhood turtle.
8596350	8597951	I wanted to share a quick funny story.
8598431	8603875	My wife was downstairs last night cooking dinner when she heard me let out a shriek as if my soul was being ripped out.
8604435	8608718	She ran upstairs concerned that I'd hurt myself and found me laughing at myself playing Alan Wake.
8609239	8610400	I was pretty embarrassed.
8610500	8611881	She had a good chuckle at that.
8613062	8617084	Sorry, I'm laughing because I'm like, what does one's soul being ripped out sound like?
8617385	8623529	But then I thought back earlier in the show to that Pokemon fighting video somebody linked us to and I'm like, oh, it probably sounded like that.
8624884	8627166	Loki, can't wait for GTA 5 to come out on PC.
8627206	8628206	I refuse to buy it twice.
8629187	8630048	And then this one's to me.
8630188	8631709	I hope that this week you aren't sick.
8632690	8633290	You know what?
8633931	8634971	I'm not sick all the time.
8635552	8636352	How are you feeling right now?
8636393	8636653	You good?
8637759	8639220	Allergies.
8640381	8642182	Having allergies is not the same as being sick.
8643403	8646485	And granted, I also got stung by an asshole wasp.
8647426	8649928	Which I'm sure Rachel will attest to.
8650628	8652450	I get pretty sick from waspies.
8653530	8654311	It was at her house.
8655592	8656873	And Rob, keep on being fabulous.
8658774	8659255	Will do.
8660532	8667971	I look forward to downloading the podcast every Monday morning so I can listen to it while working keep up the good times, your loyal turtle in Philadelphia, Serious Turtle
8669800	8670561	Next email.
8691027	8696009	I freeze up, get the big guys, and I am completely unable to speak.
8696650	8701432	The only time I rode Tower of Terror, I was literally mute for the next 30 minutes.
8701612	8702973	I could not speak.
8704273	8707155	Note to self, get Jamie to ride Tower of Terror before OLR.
8707195	8709256	It's not even funny, Rob.
8710176	8710817	Oh, come on.
8710897	8711677	It's just a joke.
8712020	8714063	Yeah, but it's a real thing and it's horrible.
8715085	8719973	So I will sit through a scary movie and just like eyes wide open and won't say anything.
8720534	8722377	You know I'm scared if I haven't said shit.
8725949	8726769	Hello, OLR.
8726849	8732451	Although PS4 certainly has a very positive vibe about it, I was very compelled to buy a PlayStation console for the first time.
8732851	8734512	I decided to get an Xbox One anyway.
8735092	8737613	The reason might sound strange, but it's Kinect that convinced me.
8737693	8740915	I like the first Kinect a lot for several reasons.
8741495	8744436	For the first time, I could play video games with everyone around me.
8744496	8747877	My girlfriend likes it, and she's very good at it, kicking my virtual ass all the time.
8748478	8751799	Even my dad and mom play from time to time, and they never played video games before.
8752459	8754440	Everyone likes it because it's so simple to use.
8754660	8763422	Even more simple than Wii or PS Move since no buttons are used at all.
8764102	8766343	Also, Kinect is a fresh wind in gaming that is needed.
8766663	8770864	It's something completely different than just another standard first-person shooter.
8773865	8793376	and that's why I don't get why Kinect gets all the hate because it sucks mostly from so-called hardcore gamers sure it's not perfect at all and it has to prove itself a lot more that's why Kinect 2 needs to get it right this time but I think that it's an important step forward in the general development of gaming a step of which we don't understand its importance yet
8794256	8797480	A step as important as the joystick or am I giving it too much credit?
8797660	8798021	Yes.
8798922	8801886	What if Kinect becomes well used and mainstream?
8802026	8802847	God, I hope not.
8803347	8805310	What would be the next step in gaming beyond that?
8805390	8808233	As always, I'm very thankful for you guys making a podcast every week.
8808333	8809134	Fabrice from Belgium.
8810218	8812460	Okay, and I am super opinionated about it.
8812620	8813481	I don't like the Kinect.
8813561	8814742	I don't have fun with the Kinect.
8814822	8816284	I've never had fun with the Kinect.
8816984	8828214	If I want to play something that's going to involve me using motion, I want a peripheral like my dance pads for DDR or my maracas for Samba.
8828334	8833359	I want something that's going to be specifically related to the game that I'm playing.
8834199	8837602	I, I hated, I don't like watching myself.
8838063	8839544	And I mean, maybe it's just a me thing.
8840085	8848332	But even though I had a lot of fun with Dance Masters, the, to do Parapara, I could not watch the screen, if that made sense.
8848873	8850955	I did all the stupid Parapara dances with my eyes closed.
8852076	8881153	well you can also turn off your silhouettes in that game if you really want to but you know well here's the thing about Kinect it's like you know yeah I might razz on Kinect a little bit but like I get that it's super accessible and that like you know people who don't even play a lot of games will be like oh what's that dance game oh that looks kind of neat I can do that I can just move and play the game I can do that you know I get where like it's highly accessible but for me the thing that really bothers me about Kinect is it's like the same three punchlines over and over it's dance and fitness games it's
8881633	8896434	or I should say it's dance games it's fitness games and you know once in a while other weird like voice integrations and things like I haven't really seen a lot of Kinect games that made me go wow this is the future of gaming a system is only as good as the games that are on it right?
8897775	8919371	and I thought maybe like Child of Eden that was kind of neat but that was like one game you know there haven't hasn't been a lot that I feel is really pushed gaming forward which is why it really surprised me when they said and the Xbox One's gonna require it and I'm like oh my god but this joke is dying fast they need to if they're gonna use the Kinect they need to like do like Kinect plus Oculus Rift or something and maybe that would be real immersive I
8920069	8920990	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8943106	8949511	I saw a thing with the Kinect and the Oculus Rift and a stationary bike for the Paperboy thing.
8949531	8957737	Yeah, I was going to say, I'm pretty sure those mods are out there because if you think about it, Oculus Rift, PC, Kinect, they have PC devices and things or drivers and things for that too.
8957817	8959518	So, you know, it's out there.
8959558	8961740	I'm sure it's just probably a pain in the butt to develop for.
8962780	8988457	Connect always reminds me of, it's in the book of Hitchhiker's Guide, because you can't really translate this into a movie, but it talks about how their society goes from push button to touch screen to connect-like thing, and it finally ends up where Zaphod Beelbrox is sitting on the bridge of Heart of Gold trying to listen to music, and you have to operate these systems, you have to sit absolutely still, because any motion towards the console whatsoever is going to trigger it.
8989118	8991679	That, to me, seems like that's where we're going with this.
8993778	8999802	I hear ya, I hear ya Alright, so next email God, we still have four emails Oh my god, really?
9000862	9008107	Kiflom, O-L-R, it's Degenerate Johnny It's a GTA 5 reference, ask Loki what that means Okay Say what now?
9008567	9019934	Kiflom Oh yeah, it's the made up Scientology Oh god It's what they say to each other Kiflom
9020600	9047932	I couldn't help but notice the argument that that wasn't really an argument that Jamie and Loki had last week over their tastes in video games I'm often entertained by your arguments but they sometimes have a tense feel about them just an observation the beauty of interactive entertainment is that there's a variety of good games that will appeal to many but not to everyone it's for this reason why Alan doesn't play Dead Space why Bobby doesn't play Shooters why Rob doesn't play Cookie Clicker that's not true
9048752	9052273	Personally, I don't very much care for the Elder Scrolls series.
9052313	9054774	Melee combat in the first-person perspective doesn't work well for me.
9055294	9063877	As an individual who appreciates both game series, I can see why one of the main problems between Mass Effect and GTA involves the relationship between stories and gameplay.
9064697	9070219	I may be generalizing here, but Mass Effect's heavily involved story and dialogue often gets in the way of the stellar gameplay.
9071019	9075261	I know the dialogue can be skipped, but some people just want to play the game.
9076221	9077783	I didn't think it was an argument, was it?
9094895	9095876	Rob, I disagree with you all the time.
9114594	9116476	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9130348	9131690	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9156093	9169021	I also want to address the misconception of the GTA series having a misogynistic atmosphere Even though GTA has often been littered with prostitutes and strippers the game series has had a variety of strong female characters dating back to GTA 3
9170282	9171143	I'm going to go ahead and say this.
9171343	9174727	Having a few strong female characters does not make up for misogyny.
9174907	9175348	Just saying.
9176770	9183297	The one thing about the GTA series is that it plays the role of social commentator in the world we live in today, i.e.
9183377	9186641	life provider equals Facebook, medical cocaine equals marijuana.
9187882	9193487	GTA 5 is no exception to this because it often has commented against our patriarchal society throughout the game.
9194147	9200632	Even though there is yet to be a lead female character in the GTA series, GTA 5 has strong female characters throughout the story.
9201113	9207518	One such example is female crew members that you can select for heists.
9207998	9216125	Many of the most skilled crew recruits are women and they know it, which is why they get a higher take from jobs than the male crew recruits.
9216645	9220347	Not to mention GTA Online offers the option for you to be a woman.
9220687	9227569	With that being said, maybe sometime in the future we could expect Jamie to join the VOG crew to take down the patriarchal douchebags that infest the online community.
9227629	9229970	I'm actually already working on something for that, but more later.
9231231	9241875	Anyways, as an individual who has a significant appreciation for strong women in video games, the KOTOR series, Final Fantasy XII, Mirror's Edge, I just wanted to add in my two cents, Sincerely, Degenerate Johnny.
9242455	9267275	I think what my problem more with the misogynistic presentation in the game is the fact that it is coming from real life that it's an aspect of real life that seems to be almost an ingrained part of culture that shouldn't be that we should strive to be better than
9268439	9268659	I think
9301754	9320924	I think it's not necessarily just a matter of looking to be offended people are going to be offended as a reaction and as I've often said not necessarily on the show but in real life you can't necessarily help a reaction you can help by acting instead of acting on your reaction
9321804	9342103	so I think that the problem being is that illustrating that yeah, this is a part of society the fact that it has to be something that's brought up in a game to be a realistic parody means that it's something that needs more attention to be combated if that makes sense yeah, it's something to think about
9342856	9372195	and I mean and you know honestly it was a big turn off for me in trying to play the game I'll sit and watch I've sat and watched a bunch of the missions in the game while Dan played because he I could not touch the PS3 anytime Dan was home because he was always playing that game and I watched a lot of it but after a while there's just like so much you can take before you're like wow I've hit my saturation point I feel really down you know
9375127	9396412	it's a really hard thing to put a finger on because I think I'm hearing that maybe the problem is that like okay yeah the joke is funny the first 500 times yeah but there's only so much you want to hear derogatory terms being used toward women even if it's done in a parody sense after a while it really does stop being funny Chell wants to chime in here
9397136	9411419	I think this is, you know, if we are going along the lines of GTA as a big over-the-top parody, is it sounds like it's kind of falling prey to Dave Chappelle syndrome, where after a certain point he stopped doing the show because he realized the wrong people were laughing at his jokes.
9411719	9417600	Because, you know, there's only so far you can go with ironic racism before it just loops around and becomes good old-fashioned racism.
9417940	9421041	And that seems like what's happening a bit here.
9421181	9422141	You know, the parody is getting...
9422681	9427642	Too close to the truth and it stops being funny for some people.
9427902	9429703	It's my two cents.
9430703	9432063	I actually fully agree with that.
9432103	9434824	That is on the money.
9435684	9435904	All right.
9435964	9444787	Well, in the interest of time, I'm going to ask Jamie to go to the next email, but keep those emails coming on this topic or tweets, mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com or twitter.com slash OLR.
9445467	9449928	Well, since Reginator just told me to skip his email, I'm skipping it.
9450428	9450668	Sorry.
9452193	9453134	I don't know, I might go back to it.
9453174	9454354	Roll it over for next week, I guess.
9455555	9456636	God, this one's long, too.
9456656	9460379	No, I mean, it's fucking really fucking long.
9460839	9462100	It's from Raw Still UT.
9465022	9469505	No, it's really... Okay, I'm gonna go for it.
9469525	9470786	We need a TLDR.
9470806	9472547	Can we try to get a TLDR version of it?
9474008	9474848	Just for time's sake.
9475229	9476489	I'm going to just read the first paragraph.
9476509	9478370	Because it has to do with what we just talked about.
9478390	9479130	Here's my suggestion.
9479190	9480671	You go to the next email.
9480791	9483312	I'll skim this email and try to pick out the key points.
9483832	9484792	Hey, OLR gang.
9485333	9490715	As I typically save the show for my commute two plus hours a day, I don't have much opportunity to call into the show.
9491155	9494956	I noticed that the mailbag has been fairly empty lately, so I had a suggestion.
9494996	9498558	Why not address comments from the podcast entries on the VOG Network page as well?
9499438	9505705	By the way, I'm well into my first playthrough of Mass Effect 2, just in case there wasn't a requisite mention of Mass Effect elsewhere in the show.
9506446	9514595	I've also been playing Dragon Fantasy Book 1 on my PS Vita, which is a hilariously old-school 8-bit RPG in tradition of the early Dragon Quest games.
9514715	9517258	Until next time, John K. Critical Myth.
9518870	9520292	Great question from Critical Myth.
9520372	9529265	We do try to incorporate the VOG Network comments, especially on a slower news week, but we haven't done them in a while, to be fair.
9529445	9533270	And I might actually be confusing with Horde House, because I know we do VOG comments more often over there.
9533691	9534692	But certainly, I mean...
9535673	9540178	The thing about the VOG comments, I tend to just respond to them on the spot.
9540558	9542720	Like when I see those comments, I can't wait for Sunday.
9543161	9544802	I just have to respond on the spot.
9545163	9548586	So if you want to get something right away, the VOG comments are the place to go.
9548626	9554892	But if there's like a really good point or counterpoint or something brought up, it's going to come to the show one way or another.
9555173	9558036	I'm going to inevitably say, yeah, somebody was posting about this on VOG.
9558815	9564102	Well, while you're back to scanning that one, I'll read Reginator's email.
9564122	9564803	Okay, you got it.
9565223	9565844	Since it's short.
9566324	9570810	Hi all, this is everyone's favorite emailer, Hero2Many, and a total amazing all-around guy, Reginator.
9572572	9573794	Hey, it was on the email.
9574735	9575275	So I said it.
9575896	9576497	Thank you for watching!
9591333	9597455	As late as August 2012, I would have scoffed at the notion of PC gaming having been a console fanboy for the better part of my life.
9598076	9604278	Now that I've been on Steam for a while now, plus having played Diablo 2 as well, I'm quite thoroughly enjoying PC gaming.
9604938	9610220	I also, as of late, have been questioning whether or not I really need to replace my PS3.
9610780	9612641	That being said, I'd like to pose this question.
9612741	9618303	Have any of you been in a situation where you enjoyed X so much that you questioned whether or not to replace Y?
9618863	9630436	This email has been brought to you by the clearly superior Japanese soundtrack Japanese version of the Sonic CD soundtrack The US version is just lame, y'all better recognize For the record, I don't think it's lame I just think the Japanese music is better
9631690	9631990	Thank you.
9632030	9634132	That's the same thing I say about Chrono Trigger and Super Metroid.
9634152	9636073	I'm like, I'm not saying Chrono Trigger is bad.
9636853	9637254	I'm not.
9637994	9640076	In fact, it's better than good.
9640656	9643478	But it's just, Super Metroid is like top tier.
9643498	9644399	It's better than bad, it's good?
9645419	9645659	Sure.
9646760	9650543	And I'm going to say this, I've never been in that situation because, I mean, shit.
9651343	9655106	I probably have just about every video game system that's worth owning.
9656587	9659228	I've never been in that situation that I, you know.
9659909	9661390	Now, I've had games that
9662924	9681541	like for example Dragon Ball GT Final Bout when I owned that game it was worth a lot of money I traded it for Blue Stinger I've never regretted it even though I can get that game any number of ways now I don't care it's not that great of a game and I'm totally not into Dragon Ball that much anymore unless I'm like watching the old school stuff
9683772	9688196	All right, I am going to try to tackle this email from Ross Steel UT, and I'm going to shorten it.
9688216	9695522	So I apologize to Ross Steel UT in that regard, but it is a very long letter, and we're already at 9 o'clock, and we still have to get calls and wrap the show.
9695542	9698044	Do you think it would be possible we can allow it to be reposted on the forums?
9698284	9699545	I would want his permission for that.
9700706	9703149	We asked him to post it on the forum.
9703249	9704911	But let me get some of the stuff.
9704951	9708316	Because first it starts off with a couple paragraphs about the whole Grand Theft Auto V thing.
9708776	9715565	So he says, I thought I'd explain to Loki why the casual sexism, racism, and homotransphobia in Grand Theft Auto V is offensive to people.
9716365	9718687	I firmly agree that not every game needs a female lead.
9719287	9722429	There's plenty of room in the space between lead character and joke character.
9722850	9727333	When a group that you're in is exclusively depicted in an offensive manner, that's not going to be fun.
9727713	9732876	Vice City put that into focus for me as a Cuban-American who went to school with more than a few Haitian-American in his day.
9732936	9736739	The gangs were simply identified by race, and all the characters were racist cardboard cutouts.
9737219	9739501	Compare that to games based around the Clancyverse.
9739541	9745625	The main protagonist tends to be a white dude, but women in other races are treated with respect and are never relegated to the sidelines.
9747106	9770835	both GTA and the Clancy games are plainly aimed at the male demographic but the latter does so in a manner that respects minorities and women while the former makes jokes out of them this isn't to say Rockstar should be forbidden to do what they do I'm a big proponent of free speech however that free speech goes both ways and if Rockstar wants to continue to take the cardboard cutout approach to their characters and rely exclusively on negative stereotypes they should be ready to be called out on it
9771195	9776860	In fact, I don't think Rockstar cares as they've been relying on cheap headline grabbing garbage to sell Grand Theft Auto for years now.
9777280	9781544	Solving the problem might lead to less sales, so why stop degrading women and minorities?
9783446	9788911	I think the... I'm a little bit with you, Rosteel UT, until like your last two sentences.
9789471	9797798	And the reason for that is that I think you're also kind of dismissing why... that quite possibly there are people that are drawn to Grand Theft Auto because it's a good game.
9798599	9799259	Outside the story.
9799299	9806903	Like, I kind of think for Loki, I don't mean to put words in your mouth, but I always got the sense you're an open world explorer, do your own thing kind of guy.
9807543	9810565	That's what you like out of Grand Theft Auto way more than the story.
9810945	9817068	I would say that there's a lot more depth that's been put in place aside from Vice City, what came out in 2002.
9817108	9817408	I mean, that's...
9820770	9834925	You can't judge a game now like Grand Theft Auto 5 based on Grand Theft Auto 1 or even some of the games that were in the early 3D series, 3 through Vice City and that kind of stuff.
9835445	9840367	It's just, it's so different now that they have a lot more writing involved in the characters.
9840447	9846729	It's not just, hey, it's this Haitian guy, he's a gang member now and stuff.
9846989	9849549	There's a lot more to it, unfortunately.
9851750	9852851	I'm not really going to go there.
9853271	9867863	Granted, yeah, some of the earlier games are probably more like that where it's like, hey, we've got the triads and they're going to act Chinese and oh, hey, we've got this gang and this nationality because they were limited what they could do as far as looks and stuff.
9867883	9870385	They couldn't get that many characters that look different.
9870405	9870826	Memory.
9870846	9871106	Memory.
9871724	9885824	also if I may say something he made a point though that is something that I have very recently said to my mother freedom of speech does not mean freedom from consequence and so they if I'm sure they had to have anticipated some fallout from it so
9887230	9889732	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
9909191	9933593	and there's a double standard in gaming media and it sickens me says the email and then he goes on a great deal to talk about Steam Machine and I'm going to apologize because this is the part I've really got to trim down for time but basically he says A. People who don't already have PCs are not going to buy $1,000 hardware and $200 yearly upgrades for the privilege of being locked to a single vendor and losing all the portability and control they enjoy on consoles.
9933633	9934034	I think there's a
9934654	9941240	There's a little bit of worry that the Steam machine is not going to give you the plug-and-play that PCs essentially give you in the build-your-own-PC world.
9941260	9943882	You don't have that same freedom, and I get that.
9944923	9947726	And he kind of draws comparisons to 3DO with that as well.
9949527	9958815	And then he talks about how many games... Sorry, I'm trying to paraphrase this here.
9959476	9960377	It's basically...
9961801	9976521	if you're invested in Steam you likely know how to get your PC working on the television which also has the bonus of allowing you to play games from anywhere not just Steam how many games particularly games that wouldn't be god awful on any kind of controller don't come to consoles anymore
9976741	9976961	PCGamers.com
9994239	9994900	and so on.
9996481	9998523	Ownership of the software is another huge point.
9999283	10008631	PC gamers, he says, have gone to Valve in force, but the mainstream market isn't going to spend $60 on title they don't feel like they own.
10009772	10018560	Steam has lots of sales to alleviate that, but we're never going to get the point where 99 cent or $5 or even $5 to $15 is the norm for new released AAA titles.
10018980	10025085	Activision would laugh Valve reps right out of the office in mere suggestion of devaluing the massive Call of Duty money machine to get that way.
10025626	10028649	Activision is kind of in the minority.
10028669	10039621	Well, they're not in the minority, but them, Take-Two, and EA, the big three guys that put out some massive titles that are also on PC.
10040322	10043385	Yeah, Call of Duty, it's still $60 on PC.
10043865	10045447	And that didn't used to be the case.
10045487	10050191	It used to be $10 cheaper, but they were like, we're Call of Duty, so we can get away with that.
10051712	10052993	But that's not true for everything.
10053013	10054414	NBA 2K14 is $30 on PC versus $60 on console.
10054494	10055055	And so I think...
10062681	10070827	Some of their bigger titles, yeah, the price point is the same as console, but there's also modding support with some of these games.
10070927	10074969	There's also all the different features it can get on PC.
10075109	10079713	Plus, the PC retail market, there's not really a big retail market anymore for PC.
10079773	10085456	Good luck finding the one rack that they have at GameStop or something that has your PC product.
10085476	10091020	That's the biggest point I get from this email that I really want to call out, and this will be the last thing I say about this email.
10091040	10092081	I want to read this one paragraph.
10092881	10120752	all this of course ignores the likely fact that these things will almost certainly not be heavily promoted by GameStop or Best Buy at least in a manner other than trade in your steam machine here both of who have very lucrative pre-owned programs that they won't put in jeopardy good luck selling a box with no mainstream appeal at Walmart especially the mostly disinterested hardware partners who aren't going to make a massive push without software compensation I do get that point and it is a good question to ask who is this for?
10122242	10122883	I don't know.
10122963	10123443	That's the thing.
10123903	10127386	I don't understand.
10128227	10129007	He does make a point.
10129268	10133531	The hardcore PC users already figured out how to hook these things up to their TV.
10133831	10142138	The casuals aren't going to buy something like this when there's the consoles and other, especially at a Walmart, there's lots of cheaper stuff sitting on the shelves.
10142458	10143539	Who is this really for?
10144781	10149744	I don't know, because, you know, the thing is that they're going to compete with consoles.
10149764	10151265	They have to compete with price.
10151285	10157029	I mean, because this is, look at, we give, at least I give shit to Xbox One for being $100 more than the PlayStation 4.
10157730	10163494	But, fuck, a PC with a Titan graphics card is not going to be anywhere near $500.
10164814	10165695	That shit's going to be like $1,500.
10167196	10174219	Alright, so to give a counterpoint to Ross Steele's email, let me go to our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com and I think this is a good way to end it on.
10174659	10179662	Dungeon Buster says, who says that Valve might decide to go the general retail route at all?
10180382	10190867	And I think that's a good point and maybe something we need to consider that maybe the media, gaming media or whatever you want to call it, maybe we're making a bigger deal out of this than it really is.
10192881	10193201	Who knows?
10193522	10194402	All right, let's move on.
10195763	10196464	Lots of email tonight.
10196484	10200688	I fully look forward to the Origins machine, you know.
10200828	10201628	No thanks.
10201708	10202189	Pass.
10202789	10203029	Pass.
10203310	10209475	All right, let's get to the FUs of the week where we get a little angsty on the show because... Because...
10224700	10229884	Um, my FU goes back to the wasp from last week because the stinger finally came out.
10231064	10233346	And my finger hurts a lot less now, thankfully.
10233826	10239250	Also, FU to the blisters on the bottoms of my feet that are right up at the top by the toes because I was stupid.
10239830	10241071	I take responsibility for this.
10241451	10246515	I wore my Vibrams walking on concrete and I hadn't worn them in a long time, so I rubbed my foot a little bit raw.
10247415	10250357	And then an FU to Wasabi, the restaurant.
10251258	10255679	Their sushi is normally very, very good, but they put sriracha damn near everything.
10256319	10261580	Like, thankfully it wasn't touching my food, except that I think that there was some in my food.
10261620	10269122	I think there was some cross-contamination going on because I broke out in hives and my throat swelled and I had to take lots of Benadryl when I got home.
10269282	10274763	So, and for me, my food allergies, yeah, they're weird, but they're easily avoidable.
10275583	10278264	So, fuck sriracha.
10280273	10283375	I guess you didn't buy into those Sriracha Lays chips when they were out either.
10284535	10286556	Dan told me that those just tasted like hot ketchup.
10287416	10287776	Loki.
10289537	10292678	F you to my head hurting.
10294079	10295780	I think allergies because my eyes are burning too.
10297940	10301602	I'll just give a quick F you to the stress of putting on a show and directing it.
10302442	10306964	As much as I am very proud of the people that are working very hard to do this show and I know it's going to be great.
10307904	10309405	I want my free days back.
10309805	10310545	Less stress.
10311225	10312746	But I've only got six more days to go.
10312886	10313826	It will be a kickass show.
10313846	10314246	It really will.
10314706	10314986	All right.
10316107	10316587	Last up.
10317087	10317367	Michelle.
10318088	10321509	I'd like to give an F you to Gina Gershon because she don't know shit.
10322749	10324090	But she does a great Versace.
10325310	10327651	Keep in mind, she is playing Versace in a Lifetime movie.
10328451	10328891	Just saying.
10329591	10329912	All right.
10329932	10331032	All right.
10333109	10335172	I can't believe you gave an FU to Gina Gershon.
10335192	10335833	I love that woman.
10336494	10336874	All right.
10337255	10339758	Just a couple more stories and then we'll do some quick calls.
10339818	10341000	We're running a little long tonight.
10341100	10343243	The tech issues earlier put us back.
10343684	10345967	So you're not going to have a lot of time to get through.
10346107	10348951	So I will put the call out in just a couple minutes here for calls.
10349272	10349972	But first, Loki.
10351707	10354508	So, the Ouya's coming out in European markets.
10355808	10356589	Is anyone excited?
10357929	10359390	I know I'm excited.
10360310	10361050	Europe's excited.
10362111	10362471	Are they?
10363011	10363991	Who bought your Ouya?
10364291	10365792	Was it a listener or just some random?
10365932	10366692	I think some random guy.
10366872	10367212	Oh, okay.
10367432	10367812	That's cool.
10368093	10368733	I'm done with it.
10369353	10372534	So, wash my hands of that.
10373154	10374695	So, yeah, it'll be coming out.
10374715	10378096	99 euro in Germany, France, Italy, Australia.
10378476	10388564	Andrea, Switzerland, Spain, Scandinavia, Norway, Denmark, and late October.
10389825	10399172	Distributors Flashpoint and Digital Brothers will be handling the distribution duties in Western Europe, while Action and PA will take Eastern Europe.
10401098	10419344	so hopefully hopefully the people in Europe will be luckier than the people in the US because OUYA themselves can't handle distribution for shit so handing off to somebody else might be a little bit better and I still want to know and I'm probably going to check this right now
10420024	10429731	I want to know if people still actually haven't gotten their Kickstarter Ooyas because I think there were still some people out there that did not have their Kickstarter Ooyas.
10429971	10431432	That's sad and such.
10432813	10441239	Alright, speaking of sad, this guy has definitely left his mark on the video game universe, which is funny because he wasn't necessarily a game designer, but...
10441659	10445601	Tom Clancy passed away this week in Baltimore at age 66.
10466631	10468813	RedStorm Entertainment RedStorm Entertainment
10485783	10487124	So rest in peace, Tom Clancy.
10488906	10489487	That's too bad.
10491428	10497954	Unfortunately, as time goes on, people that provide our beloved entertainment pass away.
10498975	10501297	66 is pretty young.
10501317	10502178	66 is still pretty young.
10502218	10504701	That does make it all the more tragic.
10504961	10506082	Yeah.
10508484	10509424	You had some pretty good games.
10509444	10510424	Well, I haven't read those books.
10510444	10511525	Yeah, those games are very popular.
10511545	10513365	I mean, I'm going to be completely honest.
10513405	10514745	I'm not going to fake it, okay?
10515246	10523127	I don't really play these games myself, but I listen to other podcasters that really do enjoy these games, and I get why people are really into them.
10523187	10527608	I think if you're into that military stuff, they are a heck of a lot of fun, or at least they sure sound fun.
10527648	10529789	But for me, I'm so challenged with the shooting games.
10529849	10534090	Here's the thing, and hey, actually, we may be past the opportunity for that.
10535410	10535791	Nevermind.
10535851	10536914	That was last month, I think.
10536974	10540922	Rainbow Six Vegas, I remember, was part of the free games with live.
10541022	10542806	So, yeah.
10542826	10545011	It's Halo 3 now.
10546645	10549707	because, you know, I didn't buy that game at launch or anything.
10550227	10550648	I know, right?
10550848	10552229	Yeah.
10552689	10557392	Oh, I want to say real quick, as I mentioned, that I think that there might have been some people.
10557472	10560534	Yep, there are some people from the Kickstarter that still haven't fucking gotten their system yet.
10560554	10561275	Oh, that's horrible.
10561615	10563136	And they are not too pleased by that.
10563556	10565237	Oh, gee, I wonder why.
10565718	10567219	Using such colorful language.
10567239	10567799	Yeah.
10569140	10569360	Yeah.
10571830	10577732	Alright, we are going to go ahead and open up the Skype line, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
10577772	10581353	Again, that's 1-877-GAME-OLR or Orange Lounge Radio.
10582213	10584594	I will go to Twitter as well, but Loki, any last minute stories?
10586815	10595477	Um... Grand Theft Auto Online, or I should have said Grand Theft Auto is the most played online game right now for, you know, the Xbox 360.
10596698	10596918	Cool.
10598118	10598618	I can see that.
10600479	10600559	Um...
10602598	10604420	That's it.
10604981	10605922	Nope, the phone's lighting up.
10605982	10606863	I'll go to Twitter in a minute.
10607003	10608365	First, we will take a phone call.
10608485	10609607	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
10609647	10609987	Who's this?
10610728	10612830	It's the only one with the fastest internet in the chat room.
10612870	10613371	It's Ranma.
10613491	10614432	You got it, Ranma.
10614452	10615433	What's on your mind tonight, buddy?
10616154	10621761	I had a lot of things I wanted to bring to the table, but since we're cut for time, I have one thing I do want to bring to the table.
10621941	10622402	Go for it.
10623183	10630767	Alright, long story short, we're working together with other anime gaming communities to work together.
10630807	10633588	We're having a fundraiser for a friend of the show.
10634048	10639471	I don't know if you saw me screaming this out on my Facebook and my Twitter, but we had a friend of the show.
10639751	10647115	I did see this and my stupid ass forgot to retweet it because I got it while I was working, but please, I think this is great, so please, by all means, pimp away.
10647717	10651603	Alright, we have an Indiegogo going called Love for Venus, A Charity for Kathleen.
10651963	10658493	Long story short, her and her mom and her friend were driving to AWA and there was a car accident.
10658673	10662819	She made it through, but unfortunately her mother didn't survive the car accident.
10663741	10671749	We opened up this Indiegogo fundraiser to help cover for medical and bereavement costs because of various issues.
10672589	10676673	Within the first day alone of the soft goal, we hit our goal, which was $500.
10678716	10680317	We're still going strong.
10680357	10683360	It's still going for the next 39 days, and we've raised $4,850.
10686343	10687244	Oh, that is so good.
10687544	10688264	That is great.
10688404	10689024	Because you know what?
10689064	10690345	Funerals ain't free, y'all.
10691366	10704172	And that's, I mean, I can't imagine what this poor girl who just lost her mother in a horrific, you know, accident has to be going through, you know, and to even like, you know, she's trying to pull through this thing herself.
10704252	10705452	It's like, this is awful.
10705973	10710295	So I'm really glad to see the communities there and supporting and putting money where their mouth is, so to speak.
10711854	10713115	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
10740560	10742261	Thank you for watching!
10760347	10763268	as one giant family to help one of our own.
10763928	10766109	And Atlanta is the place for that to happen, too.
10766189	10768910	I saw that at DragonCon with everybody coming together.
10769491	10775453	And so I'm sure Anime Weekend Atlanta is probably just the cool-down convention from DragonCon in some way.
10775493	10776113	I shouldn't say that.
10776133	10782536	That might be offensive to some, but I don't mean it to be whatsoever because I think I had such a blast at DragonCon.
10783136	10785577	I'm sure Atlanta puts on some great stuff.
10786383	10787143	I'll give you a hint.
10787204	10789265	This is how you know this is your cool-down con.
10789565	10795168	If you're at the convention and you find yourself drinking more than anything else, that's your cool-down con.
10797570	10798130	I like that.
10798150	10799411	We did a lot of that at Fonami, though.
10800131	10800671	Yep.
10802312	10807295	I remember trying to find the one vending machine that actually had soda that wasn't horribly expensive.
10808296	10815480	And you were ready to jump over that counter at that woman who couldn't serve us alcohol because it was closed or something like that.
10817162	10818463	Thank God for Pineapple Malibu.
10819544	10825809	Ranma, one more time, what is the link for the Indiegogo you said?
10826509	10844022	Alright, the short version is igg.me slash at slash loveforvenus The main Facebook page is facebook.com slash projectlovevenus and there is a little button that takes you to this information on our website at animejamsession.com
10845171	10846231	That sounds awesome.
10847211	10848392	Thanks for all you're doing for that.
10848452	10850432	It's such gamer good news this week.
10850452	10855733	I talked about the Gemet breast cancer stream earlier and now you've got this going on.
10856714	10859634	I'm sure there's lots of other great charitable events going on at the gaming community.
10859654	10864356	We're starting to get into that season with the holiday season where there's going to be a lot of child's play fundraiser events.
10864576	10866076	So very excited to see that.
10866576	10867057	Definitely.
10867677	10867938	Alright.
10868378	10876447	Well, Ranma, I will let you go so we can get some more calls, but take care and everybody should listen to Anime Jam Session Tuesdays at 6.30 Pacific, 9.30 Eastern Time.
10876908	10877388	That's right.
10877528	10878690	Right after Electric Sisterhood.
10879270	10879671	Sure enough.
10879951	10880552	Alright, take care.
10880572	10881533	Alright, thank you.
10881553	10881893	Bye.
10881913	10882073	Bye.
10882794	10884114	1-877-GAME-OLR 1-877-GAME-OLR 1-877-GAME-OLR
10908400	10908981	Weirdness.
10909041	10910883	But we do have another call coming in, so let's go to it.
10911223	10912244	Hello, you're on Orange Sons Radio.
10912264	10912584	Who's this?
10913425	10914286	Legend of Zaku here.
10914346	10915567	Hey, haven't heard from you in a while.
10915587	10916448	How you doing, Zaku?
10917008	10917809	I'm doing fine.
10917969	10925396	Yeah, I've been at my girl's place for a few weekends now, but other than that, I've been missing out on all hours.
10925476	10928499	I'm playing catch-up while she's in Europe for a few weeks.
10928960	10932883	All right, well, I suppose we can forgive this one time.
10932903	10933424	But what's on your mind?
10934976	10938880	Nothing much, just trying to whore out GTA V as much as I can.
10939741	10945326	It's been pretty much the centerpiece of my gaming life for the past few weeks now.
10945987	10948929	So what is it about this game that just makes you so crazy about it?
10949910	10950291	Trevor.
10951092	10953574	I'm not going to spoil it, but just that character alone.
10954995	10957357	I see Loki smiling over there, so you get it?
10960740	10971003	and I probably haven't even gotten through half the game and already he's already proven to be the batshit insane one.
10972584	10974344	Otherwise the others are just as fucked up.
10975045	10976725	You know, like Michael and Franklin.
10976785	10985568	But yeah, that's what I've been doing so far and trying to get myself in that Steam Machine beta.
10986524	10988085	I think a lot of people are with you there.
10988586	10989446	Good luck, though.
10989927	10992008	I hope somebody in the Oil Army gets one.
10992248	10994610	And please give us the exclusive hearts.
10995950	10996731	Yeah, I know.
10996771	10997792	I mean, it took a while.
10997832	11004856	All I had to do was just, like... The last thing I had to do was play something with a controller, which I was able to do a few days ago.
11004956	11006477	But other than that, I'm already in.
11006497	11009679	What was I going to say?
11010040	11010160	Uh...
11012142	11013924	What about Grand Theft Auto 5 Online?
11013964	11015124	Have you been dipping into that at all?
11015144	11017106	I haven't done that yet.
11017606	11026432	I guess I've made it a personal mission of mine to just wait it out as much as possible instead of having to deal with the disappointment of not getting in.
11027292	11028993	And speaking of which, have you guys...
11030214	11033378	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
11043059	11056649	If you go to the Rockstar Social Club, which I believe is socialclub.rockstar.com, and then you can go to, I think it's slash crews and then slash VOG Network would be how you would get to it.
11057469	11062133	Yeah, so socialclub.rockstargames.com slash crews slash VOG Network.
11063133	11067216	And the other option would be to also go into our forums, and we have a link there, too.
11068517	11068818	I see.
11069598	11079147	Alright, I guess I'll end up trying that and hopefully it won't be as... Try to shoot Loki a bunch for me since I don't know when I'll get in there.
11080188	11090117	I mean, you gotta give Rockstar credit given the fact that they're doing their best to try to lurch this thing forward as much as possible without any false starts.
11090817	11093560	But then again, it's like a bad week to be an IT grunt.
11095831	11109036	if it's not Grand Theft Auto Online it's the health exchanges basically not being up so it's basically all around there's demand for just about everything the woes of being popular on the internet
11109778	11110479	That is true.
11111239	11113021	All right, Zaku, I got to let you go.
11113321	11114122	We got to go wrap up.
11114142	11115203	But thank you so much for the call, buddy.
11115924	11116124	Yep.
11116344	11116604	Take care.
11116624	11117045	Have a good one.
11117205	11119006	Have fun shooting people in Grand Theft Auto.
11119947	11120708	Yeah, will do.
11120868	11121148	All right.
11121429	11121989	Stay good.
11122590	11122910	All right.
11123611	11125813	And sadly, guys, I am going to close up the Skyblind.
11125873	11126593	I am so sorry.
11126673	11128395	I know there were more trying to get through, but...
11128735	11129996	DarkSakura loves to read your emails.
11130036	11130417	Speaking of...
11148493	11148853	tweets.
11148893	11150834	I wanted to read a couple just real quick here.
11151414	11152654	TigerClaw sent us a couple.
11152994	11160476	We talked about the offline SimCity one earlier, so let me do this one, which is Activision Blizzard turning the patent battle up a notch.
11161156	11163377	I didn't even know there was a thing going on there with that.
11164337	11165138	Trying to bring it up here.
11166838	11167318	Let's see.
11167398	11169339	This is when they got sued over Worlds Inc.
11169459	11170739	on an online game patent.
11171179	11174820	Activision Blizzard is suing back over different online game patents.
11176021	11177061	So, essentially...
11178277	11179638	What is the Worlds game?
11179878	11185340	Worlds Player Software was a toolkit for creating 3D multiplayer online worlds.
11185760	11194983	This goes all the way back to 2008 when Worlds did a lawsuit against NCSoft claiming City of Heroes violated its virtual space patent.
11195483	11198184	It was dismissed after the two companies settled.
11198624	11205047	But it looks like Activision Blizzard is not going to settle anytime soon and they are taking these patent guys to court.
11206007	11207768	I hope they can get that all sorted out.
11207888	11213910	I think patent laws need to be reexamined in this country myself because we hear a lot about these patent messes all the time.
11214490	11216511	But that's just me and that's probably for another week.
11216531	11218772	There's a lot of shit in this country that needs to be fixed.
11220332	11221373	But unfortunately, we're out of time.
11222513	11224294	Chell, I want to thank you so much for being here tonight.
11224534	11224974	Thank you.
11225394	11230756	I know you didn't get to say a lot, a lot outside, but the stuff you did say, I had to fist bump you several times tonight.
11230816	11233277	So thank you for your viewpoint tonight.
11233777	11235358	And please come back again sometime soon.
11235778	11259084	and thank you so much for having me as soon as I can anything you want to plug even if that's your friend's game again or what have you I kind of want to plug another game too it's also an indie game forgot to plug it earlier it doesn't have a demo out yet but once it does I am downloading that shit it's called Coral Cove completely traditional art illustrated and animated so cool
11259696	11260217	Very nice.
11260737	11265762	And Gabe, if you're out there listening, prime candidate right here in studio.
11265943	11269146	Hire this woman when she finishes up all her schooling.
11269186	11269847	I think she'd be great.
11270527	11270868	All right.
11271909	11274211	Last but not least, we go around and we get the final thoughts.
11274732	11280818	I do want to say real quick though before we get the final thoughts, thank you guys so much for listening to our program, supporting the show.
11281158	11282880	Supporting independent broadcasting.
11282920	11284983	Thank you for taking the time out of your day to listen to us.
11285404	11287446	If you're staying up late listening to us live, thank you.
11288027	11289248	Your support means the world.
11289769	11294815	All we ask, if you do enjoy what you hear here at Orange Lounge Radio, tell a friend or two or five about the show.
11295296	11299882	And yeah, help spread the word about Orange Lounge Radio and we will grow our family even more.
11301163	11327897	don't forget about the podcast awards thing too just again for your consideration we would love it if you'd take the 15 seconds to go to podcastawards.com and nominate us for people's choice and best gaming but even if you don't choose to nominate us be sure to keep it independent because the commercial guys don't need the additional exposure they already have plenty of money let's go around and get everybody's final thought I guess I should start with our guest Chell do you have any final thoughts tonight?
11329597	11331598	It is weird not having anybody come on me.
11333678	11335939	I had to do the last showgirls reference.
11335959	11336800	You know I had to.
11338700	11341541	I like you a lot, even if that quote's gonna get you into trouble.
11341901	11342261	Alright.
11343382	11344382	DarkSakura.
11344482	11345923	I don't know how you're gonna follow that, but good luck.
11345963	11346643	What's your final thought?
11347964	11349665	Loki, your final thought?
11375896	11378559	I'm disappointed that I missed the leaked Godzilla trailer.
11379340	11379621	What?
11380202	11381363	They're making a new Godzilla?
11381503	11382244	Yeah, didn't you know?
11382424	11383245	No, I remember that.
11383265	11383966	It's been all over Tumblr.
11383986	11385789	It's like a Matthew Broderick one, I remember that.
11386049	11386610	No, this one.
11386850	11388051	It's like a legit one.
11388512	11389233	Oh, really?
11389413	11389593	Yeah.
11389814	11390214	Interesting.
11390294	11392197	All right, well, have to check that out.
11392777	11393058	All right.
11393078	11393698	It's Matthew Broderick.
11396457	11397338	He's Godzilla.
11399299	11401061	What happened to my career?
11402502	11403643	Good things, apparently.
11404023	11405684	Oh, Matthew Broderick, yeah.
11406325	11410188	Oh, yeah, no, no, the other guy, Breaking Bad and all that, yeah, but... What happened to my career?
11410388	11411509	I'm making tons of money!
11411789	11413911	Matthew Broderick, well, I think he went to stage.
11414031	11415032	I think he's done a lot with stage.
11415332	11419915	Election was one of my favorite movies ever, and that was like 13 years ago.
11419955	11420536	The producers...
11421411	11421991	Yeah, that's true.
11422011	11423853	That's why I think he's done more stage type of stuff.
11424974	11426195	Alright, there we go.
11426475	11426975	That's it.
11427155	11428777	Thank you again for tuning into the show.
11429457	11432299	Have fun with your games, people, and we will see you next time.
11432400	11436022	Next week, we'll do it all over again here at Orange Lounge Radio.
11436483	11436763	Good night.
11437597	11440158	You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
11467074	11468315	See you next week. .
