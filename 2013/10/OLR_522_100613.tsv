27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	33000	Hello my friends out there on the internet
33000	35000	And welcome back to another week of the show
35000	37000	Where every gamer has a voice
37000	39000	It is Orange Lounge Radio
39000	43000	Live with episode number 522
43000	47000	For this October the 6th of 2013
47000	49000	It is officially October
49000	51000	Only how many more days to Halloween? 25
51000	53000	If I did my math right
53000	56000	And she'll keep me in check for sure
56000	58000	Here she is everybody
58000	60000	DarkSakura or Jamie Summers?
60000	62000	Meh
62000	64000	No it's not on, now it's on meh
64000	66000	Did I do my math right?
66000	68000	I don't care
68000	70000	Math sucks
70000	72000	Why are you meh? Sunday is fun day
72000	74000	Because I'm waiting for Halloween to be over
74000	76000	So I can buy Purim costumes
76000	78000	Fair enough
78000	80000	And then get all the candy on sale
80000	84000	And then make like candy corn muffins or something
84000	86000	Actually I am planning
86000	88000	Even though I'm not doing sugar very much
88000	90000	I'm planning on making candy corn vodka
90000	92000	Hooray
92000	94000	Vodka doesn't count
94000	96000	If you're gonna drink something
96000	98000	Vodka is the best for you anyway
98000	100000	Well it liquefies the candy corn
100000	102000	So it's like candy corn syrup mixed in vodka
102000	104000	Oh my gosh
104000	106000	I bet some people would find that absolutely disgusting though
106000	108000	It's amazeballs
108000	110000	I have to ask you though, what do you think about
110000	112000	Because we do talk about video games
112000	114000	The gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle, it is a video game show
114000	116000	But let's be real, it's also a foodie show
116000	118000	Because we always talk about food on this show
118000	120000	So I have to ask you DarkSaga
120000	122000	What do you think about this time of year
122000	124000	Where it's pumpkin all the things
124000	126000	And then candy corn
126000	128000	And it's like candy corn oreos
128000	130000	This is the time of year
130000	132000	That I actually make my
132000	134000	I kind of call it gourd soup
134000	136000	But I make
136000	138000	Butternut squash pumpkin and sweet potato soup
138000	140000	Yummy
140000	142000	And it's really creamy
142000	144000	But now the way that I make these is I make them all savory
144000	146000	So I put like garlic and rosemary
146000	148000	And all kinds of savory herbs in it
148000	150000	So that it's sweet and savory at the same time
150000	152000	And you guys, she's gonna bring some to the next show
152000	154000	Yay! Maybe I will
154000	156000	I've actually got the stuff to make my soup
156000	158000	And this time I have
158000	160000	Purple mountain yams
160000	162000	To add in it this time
162000	164000	This sounds delicious, I can't wait
164000	166000	All the listeners are hungry now
166000	168000	But everybody should be jealous of my amazing dinner
168000	170000	Because I had rabbit and beef liver
170000	172000	For dinner
172000	174000	You know what, Bugs was delicious
174000	176000	If my sister could hear you
176000	178000	She would hate you, she's a bunny enthusiast
178000	180000	And she loves bunnies
180000	182000	I love bunnies too, they're fun and I'm allergic to them
182000	184000	But they're soft and fun to pet and delicious
184000	186000	Alright look
186000	188000	Going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com
188000	190000	We'll start off tonight with
190000	192000	Rama who says, too much fucking pumpkin
192000	194000	Yo
194000	196000	Well, even our chatters have wrong opinions sometimes
196000	198000	Here at Orange Lounge Radio
198000	200000	But after all it is the show where every gamer has a voice
200000	202000	I don't like pumpkin
202000	204000	And there he is, Techmaster Loki, what's wrong with you?
204000	206000	I don't like pumpkin
206000	208000	You don't like pumpkin? No
208000	210000	Well some people think I'm weird
210000	212000	Because I don't like mayonnaise
212000	214000	I don't think I introduced myself, I'm Rob Roberts by the way
214000	216000	If you don't know me, I'm Rob Roberts and I hate mayonnaise
216000	218000	I can understand eating straight up mayonnaise
218000	220000	But honest sandwich is fine
220000	222000	Or chicken salad
222000	224000	Or everything with mayonnaise
224000	226000	Okay, Alan and I went and got sushi
226000	228000	And we got this one roll and I was kind of like
228000	230000	Think that's a mayo based sauce
230000	232000	And I'm going to have to kind of like eat the edges
232000	234000	You know what, I got sushi the other day
234000	236000	And I had an allergic reaction to it
236000	238000	Because you know what was mixed in with the crab?
238000	240000	What? Sriracha
240000	242000	Oh no, sriracha crab?
242000	244000	That's weird It was how they made their spicy crab
244000	246000	They mixed sriracha in with the crab
246000	248000	And normally I'm fine with spicy crab
248000	250000	Because it's just like maybe a little
250000	252000	Something else hot, but they mixed sriracha in it
252000	254000	Which I'm like stupidly allergic to
254000	256000	So I actually still have a hive
256000	258000	And it hurts
258000	260000	Let's see, going to Raginator in our chat room
260000	262000	Says pumpkin flavored mayonnaise
262000	264000	I'm sorry, that won't work for me
264000	266000	Just like it probably won't work for Loki
266000	268000	That's not okay
268000	270000	Well here's the thing, I don't understand
270000	272000	Like putting mayonnaise on like
272000	274000	Hot things
274000	276000	You know like with a sandwich it's okay
276000	278000	But like people put it on burgers
278000	280000	Or they'll like get a sandwich at like a sandwich place
280000	282000	Yeah I like that toasted
282000	284000	It's like okay cool, now it's like this nasty
284000	286000	Hot mayonnaise
286000	288000	I am literally gagging right now
288000	290000	And I don't mean like fashion runway
290000	292000	I'm gagging at that, I mean like I am actually about to barf
292000	294000	When you're talking about that
294000	296000	I won't tell you about what my mom used to eat as a snack
296000	298000	No, ugh
298000	300000	Canned pears with mayonnaise and cheese
300000	302000	This is horrible I actually grew up on that
302000	304000	It's pretty good Alright look, we need to talk about video games
304000	306000	What about like a mayonnaise flavored
306000	308000	Flurry or something like that
308000	310000	What's wrong with you people? I like homemade mayonnaise
310000	312000	As a garnish on dishes
312000	314000	Look, be nice everybody and respectful
314000	316000	Cause we got a guest here in studio tonight
316000	318000	I bet she likes mayonnaise
318000	320000	She might, we're gonna say hello to our guest here
320000	322000	It's actually her second time on the show
322000	324000	But you know welcome back
324000	326000	As the case may be to Chell is here tonight
326000	328000	Well thank you very much for having me
328000	330000	Chell, I think you can like
330000	332000	Chow? Chell
332000	334000	Chell, it's Chell, I keep thinking Chell
334000	336000	You're a hero and a half Chell
336000	338000	Sorry Chell
338000	340000	You know the computer name
340000	342000	from Portal I can't even think about
342000	344000	pronouncing in real life so you're in good company
344000	346000	Alright fair enough
346000	348000	So you were on the show before
348000	350000	and you talked about what kinds of things
350000	352000	We did talk about your love of Portal on the last show
352000	354000	Oh yes and my deep deep love affair
354000	356000	with Earthbound slash Mother
356000	358000	Have you seen, I think this happened after
358000	360000	you were on the show, have you seen it's on Wii U virtual console now?
360000	362000	No I did not
362000	364000	I could get that puppy over here right
364000	366000	now for you to check out, it's awesome
366000	368000	That would be awesome
368000	370000	I need to play more of it to be honest
370000	372000	Have you checked out anything lately?
372000	374000	I know we're going to get into gaming weeks a little later
374000	376000	but what kind of stuff have you been into in general
376000	378000	as of late?
378000	380000	Since I've been busy, I've been getting my nostalgia on
380000	382000	with old Lucas Arts stuff and
382000	384000	a lot of free RPG stuff
384000	386000	You people light up my life
386000	388000	with your independent
388000	390000	RPGs that are fan made stuff
390000	392000	but at the same time guys
392000	394000	sometimes you need to work on your programming
394000	396000	because you know
396000	398000	I want to meet you half way but
398000	400000	when I no clip into a shelf
400000	402000	yeah
402000	404000	There's such good stuff out there though
404000	406000	There are a lot of great indie RPGs
406000	408000	and the great thing about RPGs is that
408000	410000	they take forever to beat usually
410000	412000	so they're a great time sink and I'm thinking of things like
412000	414000	Cthulhu Saves the World
414000	416000	Have you played any of that stuff?
416000	418000	Adorbs
418000	420000	Are you a Steam user?
420000	422000	My computer is broke as hell
422000	424000	It's also 4 years old
424000	426000	It's doing some interesting breakage right now in fact
426000	428000	Well if you're able to
428000	430000	put some band aids on it
430000	432000	check out Steam and some of these indie
432000	434000	RPGs are like $1.50
434000	436000	Nice
436000	438000	They'll be a winner sale as there always is
438000	440000	going into New Years and such this year
440000	442000	It'll be like
442000	444000	hand us a couple quarters and here's like 50 games
444000	446000	Sales all the things
446000	448000	Exactly
448000	450000	That's something we're bringing up in part B for people
450000	452000	who are not on Steam
452000	454000	Absolutely a little teaser
454000	456000	So Chell will have to pay attention
456000	458000	in part B there will be a quiz tonight
458000	460000	I don't know if they told you there will be a quiz
460000	462000	What other stuff do you do for fun Chell?
462000	464000	I haven't been doing much fun lately
464000	466000	I've mostly been working on just
466000	468000	getting stuff for my degree together
468000	470000	I'm working on a lot of
470000	472000	learning 3D stuff because one day I hope to
472000	474000	join the unwashed masses
474000	476000	and start churning out games like I want to play
476000	478000	Awesome
478000	480000	Have you thought about what would be your dream
480000	482000	company to work for?
482000	484000	Well Valve obviously
484000	486000	The minute the words left my mouth
486000	488000	that was the stupid
488000	490000	Rob doesn't usually ask stupid questions
490000	492000	haha at least I had to tell myself
492000	494000	but that one was pretty dumb
494000	496000	It's not just that
496000	498000	they make games that I want to play
498000	500000	it's that they seem like a really
500000	502000	chill workforce
502000	504000	Have you seen that leaked handbook
504000	506000	that's online that's like the Valve company
506000	508000	handbook like what the employees
508000	510000	get you know their corporate
510000	512000	culture is so interesting
512000	514000	Valve like I really
514000	516000	it's just so neat and like I kind of
516000	518000	think about like gosh if they try to do something
518000	520000	like that at my day job I just I don't know
520000	522000	something like that would fly like some industries
522000	524000	need structure but it's so interesting as
524000	526000	Valve has really pulled off this
526000	528000	everybody's equal we don't have
528000	530000	titles your desk is on
530000	532000	wheels and you roll it where you need to go
532000	534000	and we don't tell you what to do
534000	536000	you find projects
536000	538000	like you guys have to Google
538000	540000	this if you've never seen this before the Valve handbook
540000	542000	and technically I don't know if it's legit
542000	544000	or not but it seems like it
544000	546000	would be I have no reason to doubt it
546000	548000	Sounds pretty close yeah
548000	550000	and it's just like so interesting
550000	552000	that you know
552000	554000	a person might
554000	556000	start work at this company and they don't have any
556000	558000	assignments so they just have to go like find
558000	560000	something to do but that's the type
560000	562000	of people they're looking for
562000	564000	yeah work raising
564000	566000	alright well unfortunately as we're broadcasting
566000	568000	live here we're having a little bit of stream troubles
568000	570000	I'm going to keep going for the sake of the
570000	572000	podcast but for some reason
572000	574000	we're not actually able to reconnect
574000	576000	and what's going on
576000	578000	is actually on server room's
578000	580000	side because
580000	582000	we are not able to reconnect at all
582000	584000	so I'm going to try to
584000	586000	keep this show going while doing tech
586000	588000	at the same time
588000	590000	alright
590000	592000	I
592000	594000	well you know what we could go
594000	596000	and bring up our
596000	598000	next topic we could
598000	600000	or I have another idea too is that
600000	602000	since this is for the sake of the podcast
602000	604000	why don't we do a quick musical interlude
604000	606000	while we try to fix things
606000	608000	and then we'll be right back I could sing
608000	610000	alright you want to sing us out
610000	612000	fly me to the moon
612000	614000	no
614000	616000	To register participation for this week's episode
616000	618000	of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com
618000	620000	use the pass phrase dash
620000	622000	alright we're back that wasn't awkward
622000	624000	or anything but the joys
624000	626000	of doing live radio is
626000	628000	that sometimes the feed just
628000	630000	the internets go down there's a
630000	632000	server reboot or something happens
632000	634000	and the tubes get
634000	636000	untied or I don't know what happens
636000	638000	just being a butthole or a cat
638000	640000	just pulled out the plug let's be real
640000	642000	that's probably what happened but for
642000	644000	once that wasn't our fault at least I can say
644000	646000	so alright
646000	648000	where were we when we left off
648000	650000	I was talking to the lovely Chell
650000	652000	over there about the dream company
652000	654000	she wanted to work for we were talking about Valve
654000	656000	and just kind of
656000	658000	what a different type of company
658000	660000	Valve is so let me ask you this
660000	662000	knowing that the employees at Valve can work on
662000	664000	whatever project they want
664000	666000	if you were to get hired by Valve
666000	668000	hypothetically what would be your dream
668000	670000	project?
670000	672000	Barring Half Life Part 3
672000	674000	which may or may not be a thing
674000	676000	make sure that mics on by the way
676000	678000	siblings, siblings
678000	680000	so Barring Half Life Part 3
680000	682000	oh
682000	684000	that is a tough one
684000	686000	I really always wanted to
686000	688000	see a Portal sequel but I just wanted to
688000	690000	work on something new and fresh
690000	692000	coming down the pipe
692000	694000	they kind of hit me where I live
694000	696000	story wise everything
696000	698000	they put out is just
698000	700000	right along the lines of what I try to bring into my fiction
700000	702000	just you know the continuing themes
702000	704000	of kind of being alone
704000	706000	in a strange place and having to kind of survive
706000	708000	through strange circumstances
708000	710000	you are a little quiet by the way
710000	712000	just make sure you talk right in that mic
712000	714000	so
714000	716000	you would hope to work on Half Life 3
716000	718000	or something kind of new
718000	720000	because I'm a little fancy
720000	722000	speaking of new and fancy, Valve did make a bunch of announcements
722000	724000	last week about this Steam Box
724000	726000	have you been following this news at all?
726000	728000	I'm completely out of the loop
728000	730000	that's why we're here
730000	732000	to help you stay current
732000	734000	the Steam Box they announced is
734000	736000	it's going to have its own operating system
736000	738000	SteamOS which you can put on any computer
738000	740000	it's basically a version of Linux
740000	742000	and then they're going to be selling these computers
742000	744000	that are basically
744000	746000	it's kind of to rival consoles a little bit
746000	748000	to bring PC gaming closer to living room
748000	750000	but they'll be all these different types
750000	752000	there's no way they're going to be console prices
752000	754000	Loki's shaking us out over there, no way huh?
754000	756000	well did you see what the test specs are?
756000	758000	the test specs are going to have Titans in them
758000	760000	oh wow
760000	762000	like the super super super high end
762000	764000	Nvidia cards
764000	765000	I hope I'm one of the lucky 300 people that gets one of those
765000	767000	exactly, I'm like dude I
767000	769000	I could totally use a new PC and that would be awesome
769000	771000	just to get like
771000	773000	something like that
773000	775000	even the low end was like a
775000	777000	I think like a 680
777000	779000	that's still way better than I've got now
779000	781000	nice
781000	783000	and WhattupG says how about that new controller for the Steam Box
783000	785000	yes don't forget there is that little controller too
785000	787000	with the fancy little
787000	789000	it's really kind of weird, it's got like thumb sticks
789000	791000	but they're like touch pads
791000	793000	it's interesting, it's different
793000	795000	you know it's not the same old same old
795000	797000	anything with like a million joysticks
797000	799000	makes me want to hiss and run into a corner
799000	801000	I mean that's one of my main issues with
801000	803000	one of my continuing issues with Xbox
803000	805000	remember when Nintendo announced the Wii
805000	807000	and they came out with that Wiimote
807000	809000	and a lot of people were like it's really like simple
809000	811000	and Nintendo was like that's the point
811000	813000	so many people are intimidated
813000	815000	by all the buttons like on an Xbox
815000	817000	or a Playstation controller
817000	819000	the nice thing about the Wii controller is that
819000	821000	you know yes there's some smaller buttons
821000	823000	but for a lot of people there's just one big giant button
823000	825000	that says A and then the little trigger thing
825000	827000	and that's why so many senior citizens do the bowling
827000	829000	and all that you know
829000	831000	you think they learned from the clusterfuck that was the N64 controller
831000	833000	which was a good controller
833000	835000	but still
835000	837000	exactly
837000	839000	it gives me horrible horrible flashbacks to
839000	841000	Rebel Alliance N64
841000	843000	my brother having me help
843000	845000	hold down all the buttons so he can just
845000	847000	oh god
847000	849000	alright well Chell will be talking to you
849000	851000	about the news and such throughout the show
851000	853000	please feel free to chime in as you like
853000	855000	to have your say on whatever's going on
855000	857000	and those of you in chat rooms
857000	859000	same thing for you guys live.vognetwork.com
859000	861000	and Act F says
861000	863000	Loki that's only for the prototypes
863000	865000	Act F says the retail version
865000	867000	of the Steam Machine will probably offer
867000	869000	lower specs
869000	871000	for the prototypes it has the really kickass cards
871000	873000	of course you do
873000	875000	Daddy I want the golden
875000	877000	Steam Box Daddy
877000	879000	I want it
879000	881000	what do you mean I can't have it
881000	883000	I want the whole world
883000	885000	alright
885000	887000	I wanted to do a quick kick off topic here
887000	889000	and we are running a little behind because of the live stuff
889000	891000	so I'll just quickly talk about tonight
891000	893000	I know right
893000	895000	we're only ever here for like 4 hours
895000	897000	this is going to be a big week in gaming
897000	899000	I don't know if you want us to admit it or not
899000	901000	because Saturday October 12th
901000	903000	sees the release of
903000	905000	Pokemon X and Y
905000	907000	you're not a Pokemon fan
907000	909000	no
909000	911000	why not
911000	913000	because I have other things to like
913000	915000	like free time
915000	917000	I see
917000	919000	so you value your time
919000	921000	so much that you don't want to get sucked into Pokemon
921000	923000	because you see how Pokemon ruins lives
923000	925000	yeah thanks Shane
925000	927000	no no
927000	929000	the last one I played was Pearl
929000	931000	and I only ever played it at the gym
931000	933000	which was ironic because I was going to gyms
933000	935000	at the gym
935000	937000	ha ha ha
937000	939000	and I just
939000	941000	I don't know why that's so funny
941000	943000	but I'm laughing
943000	945000	so here's a Pokemon gym
945000	947000	so you can go to the gym at your gym
947000	949000	be funny
949000	951000	because if I were a dude
951000	953000	I could be gym
953000	955000	ha ha
955000	957000	oh my god stop
957000	959000	so
959000	961000	Rob's red
961000	963000	this is like one of those nights
963000	965000	where anything's funny
965000	967000	because there's probably people out there listening
967000	969000	going Rob it wasn't that funny
969000	971000	it's not that funny
971000	973000	alright hater
973000	975000	why are you hating
975000	977000	on the Pokemon
977000	979000	it's not serious I'm into
979000	981000	and don't get me wrong I understand that there are fans of it
982000	984000	I was just thinking
984000	986000	that's probably why they have Shane working at a certain company
986000	988000	because he is the crack dealer
988000	990000	for getting people into any game
990000	992000	and they have him behind
992000	994000	Pokemon
994000	996000	I've said this on Horde House
996000	998000	that Shane was born to do sales
998000	1000000	that's where his ultimate calling
1000000	1002000	is going to end up being someday
1002000	1004000	stop making this the Shane show
1004000	1006000	I'm sure he's listening very happy
1006000	1008000	that we're talking Pokemon
1008000	1010000	I don't understand it
1011000	1013000	the way I look at a Madden release
1013000	1015000	it's like oh cool
1015000	1017000	instead of colors this time it's X and Y
1017000	1019000	cool
1019000	1021000	and that means nothing to me
1021000	1023000	other than I assume that there's just going to be a few more
1023000	1025000	Pokemon
1025000	1027000	and you have to collect those
1027000	1029000	to add to your ever large collection
1029000	1031000	of Pokemon that you battle each other
1031000	1033000	for whatever reason
1033000	1035000	I don't understand
1035000	1037000	if you are moving in that direction
1037000	1039000	I'm kind of disappointed that there is an opportunity
1039000	1041000	for a chromosome so you get Pokemon with some
1041000	1043000	autosomal disorders
1043000	1045000	you've got the down syndrome Pokemon
1045000	1047000	that you have to help a little out
1047000	1049000	but he's punched for it
1049000	1051000	yeah he's pulling for you
1051000	1053000	that would have taken gaming into a whole new area
1053000	1055000	what about aspie Pokemon
1055000	1057000	where they take everything really literal
1057000	1059000	and then
1059000	1061000	yeah
1061000	1063000	and I'm allowed to say that
1063000	1065000	so I'm looking at our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com
1065000	1067000	and actdeft says
1067000	1069000	Jim at the gym
1069000	1071000	Jimception
1073000	1075000	alright
1075000	1077000	need to go down another level
1077000	1079000	let's see
1079000	1081000	blackwolf says Loki's not into Pokemon because
1081000	1083000	it's not Grand Theft Auto
1083000	1085000	well to be fair we had a
1085000	1087000	discussion last week where Jamie's like I'm not that
1087000	1089000	into Grand Theft Auto and now this week
1089000	1091000	I'm not that into Pokemon
1091000	1093000	and to be fair if they had some sort of mini game in Grand Theft Auto
1093000	1095000	where you had to raise dogs and fight them or something
1095000	1097000	like Michael Vick of Pokemon
1097000	1099000	I still probably wouldn't play that
1099000	1101000	because that sounds stupid
1101000	1103000	I don't know
1103000	1105000	I'm not into that type of game
1105000	1107000	especially if it has to do with
1107000	1109000	raising stuff
1109000	1111000	I blame the 10 dogs for that
1111000	1113000	because that made any sort of raising
1113000	1115000	of anything extremely boring
1115000	1117000	hey cute puppies what's wrong with that
1117000	1119000	oh everything because have you raised a dog before
1119000	1121000	it's not all
1121000	1123000	petting and playing
1123000	1125000	frisbee and stuff you have to fucking feed
1125000	1127000	that shit, wash it
1127000	1129000	you're going to be cleaning poop all day
1129000	1131000	they just want attention all goddamn hours of the day
1131000	1133000	come to think of it
1133000	1135000	right after I quit wow was after the whole
1135000	1137000	Pokemon mode came out
1137000	1139000	so maybe that has something to do with it too
1139000	1141000	to Loki's thing
1141000	1143000	they put Pokemon in wow
1143000	1145000	and I quit
1145000	1147000	huh
1147000	1149000	I thought we all quit because of LFR
1149000	1151000	that was the real reason anyway
1151000	1153000	I liked LFR to be honest
1153000	1155000	just because
1155000	1157000	I could just pew pew stuff
1157000	1159000	and as long as I didn't fuck up
1159000	1161000	which I never fucked up
1161000	1163000	I'd get pissed off at other people fucking up
1163000	1165000	but then it gave me an excuse to be mad at somebody else
1165000	1167000	my one issue with Pokemon
1167000	1169000	I like Pokemon as a franchise
1169000	1171000	I respect the games
1171000	1173000	I understand why people love them
1173000	1175000	and I really did love the old anime
1175000	1177000	judge me all you want but it was great
1177000	1179000	my one thing with Pokemon
1179000	1181000	that really got to me was that
1181000	1183000	it's kind of a grind fest
1183000	1185000	that you have to like and only the ones
1185000	1187000	you send into the fight actually get
1187000	1189000	XP and it's like oh my gosh
1189000	1191000	I gotta grind this and grind this
1191000	1193000	and it's like the OCD gamer in me and like
1193000	1195000	Shane has tried to tell me this like why are you
1195000	1197000	leveling up all your Pokemon you only need like
1197000	1199000	three of them to be really good to go somewhere
1199000	1201000	and I'm like you don't understand how I play
1201000	1203000	RPGs
1203000	1205000	yeah I totally get that it sets off my OCD
1205000	1207000	like woah it's like 100% completion
1207000	1209000	and it's in the lyrics
1209000	1211000	I want to be the very best
1211000	1213000	first sentence
1213000	1215000	yeah that re-release of the first
1215000	1217000	three games when you've got all the new
1217000	1219000	areas and you've got the three new islands
1219000	1221000	I thought it was never gonna crawl out of my room
1221000	1223000	I was gonna crawl out of it to die basically
1223000	1225000	and not for water or food or anything
1225000	1227000	so here's why I'm really excited
1227000	1229000	about X and Y is that apparently they're gonna
1229000	1231000	have this experience sharing so that now
1231000	1233000	you can actually level everything
1233000	1235000	that's in your party at once
1235000	1237000	new based Pokemon
1237000	1239000	I am so excited
1239000	1241000	so we'll see
1241000	1243000	no putting Magikarp into battle first
1243000	1245000	and hoping like hell
1245000	1247000	but you gotta admit
1247000	1249000	once you got Gyarados
1249000	1251000	everyone was fucked
1251000	1253000	it was worth it
1253000	1255000	so worth it
1255000	1257000	and I have to say that
1257000	1259000	Pokemon has offered me comfort over the years
1259000	1261000	my Charmander pillow
1261000	1263000	was my AX pillow
1263000	1265000	and my Togepi was my present
1265000	1267000	after I got held up at gunpoint
1267000	1269000	oh my gosh
1269000	1271000	you know that happened
1271000	1273000	I found $10 in the parking lot
1273000	1275000	and Dan gave me another $10
1275000	1277000	and I bought a Togepi
1277000	1279000	and I still have my Togepi
1279000	1281000	I love Togepi so cute
1281000	1283000	alright so
1283000	1285000	it sounds to me like there's
1285000	1287000	half gonna get it and half not gonna
1287000	1289000	get Pokemon
1289000	1291000	so we'll see
1292000	1294000	Pokemon is like STDs
1294000	1296000	you don't gotta catch them all
1296000	1298000	stop
1298000	1300000	alright and of course
1300000	1302000	there's the mandatory
1302000	1304000	actdeft in chat says how about them
1304000	1306000	mudkips? shut up
1306000	1308000	alright Matt Cube says
1308000	1310000	it is popular because it is a simple RPG
1310000	1312000	well you know I don't wanna spoil the
1312000	1314000	frugal question of the week cause we're gonna get into it
1314000	1316000	a little later but I just will say in general
1316000	1318000	I'm hearing a lot of people that are
1318000	1320000	really attached to Pokemon
1320000	1322000	and the reason behind it a lot of times
1322000	1324000	is that we're from that certain generation
1324000	1326000	where like we were like
1326000	1328000	13, 15 when these games
1328000	1330000	first came out
1330000	1332000	and so we've really kinda stuck to it the whole time
1332000	1334000	so for many people yeah it kinda was
1334000	1336000	the first RPG
1336000	1338000	they should totally go the route where
1338000	1340000	your Pokemon catch diseases
1340000	1342000	where you have to put them down with a shotgun
1342000	1344000	they do catch diseases
1344000	1346000	Pikachu has rabies
1346000	1348000	you have to decapitate them to figure it out

1368000	1370000	and then nurse joy won't let you
1370000	1372000	have them because you have to be evaluated

1466000	1468000	final fantasy 14 but I was
1468000	1470000	kind of drunk at the time and
1470000	1472000	getting really motion sick so I stopped
1472000	1474000	and I finally
1474000	1476000	beat level 19 on fractal
1476000	1478000	I am so freaking happy because
1478000	1480000	it was pissing me off so now I'm on like
1480000	1482000	23 fractal is
1482000	1484000	pretty much video gaming crack
1484000	1486000	and thank you rob
1486000	1488000	for gifting
1488000	1490000	bejeweled 2 to me
1490000	1492000	because I
1492000	1494000	played the crap load of that but it's still more
1494000	1496000	fun on my phone that actually was
1496000	1498000	left over from some giveaways we did a long
1498000	1500000	time ago we just never
1500000	1502000	I mean it's bejeweled 2 it was a long time
1502000	1504000	ago so actually popcap gave that to you by
1504000	1506000	proxy but I like the the puzzle
1506000	1508000	mode in the computer version
1508000	1510000	it's actually pretty fun but for the most part
1510000	1512000	and act deft I cannot
1512000	1514000	look at videos on my ipad while
1514000	1516000	I'm doing the show sorry
1516000	1518000	he linked the video
1518000	1520000	the actual video oh well the smackdown
1520000	1522000	luckily I can bring up videos
1522000	1524000	so I'm hoping if I get
1524000	1526000	rick rolled so help me god I'm gonna get the
1526000	1528000	ban hammer and you're gonna die
1528000	1530000	blame act deft that's it
1530000	1532000	that's it okay this is only 18 seconds
1532000	1534000	and I'm sorry that this is radio
1534000	1536000	and we're about to watch a video but
1536000	1538000	enjoy this audio presentation
1546000	1548000	oh my heavens
1548000	1550000	that is the most gruesome
1550000	1552000	thing I've ever seen
1554000	1556000	those are that was
1556000	1558000	squirtle taking cream was
1558000	1560000	not okay
1560000	1562000	a bite out of charmander's neck
1562000	1564000	no the audio had to be
1564000	1566000	even worse because
1566000	1568000	that sounded like
1568000	1570000	I don't know that was that was not
1570000	1572000	okay that high pitched screaming
1572000	1574000	that was that was a little too
1574000	1576000	that was a little too visually vague for me
1576000	1578000	yeah act
1578000	1580000	deft I want you to apologize to the listeners
1580000	1582000	right now poor charmander
1582000	1584000	at live that is a rabid
1584000	1586000	squirtle that squirtle needs
1586000	1588000	to be put down oh my god that sound
1588000	1590000	was horrible although
1590000	1592000	it has settled the age old debate of
1592000	1594000	reptiles versus amphibians
1594000	1596000	because you know
1596000	1598000	turtles and salamanders natural enemies
1600000	1602000	so I played other games
1602000	1604000	that did involve squirtles biting
1604000	1606000	the crap out of charmander's
1606000	1608000	and the ahhhh
1608000	1610000	ahhhh
1610000	1612000	act deft says
1612000	1614000	sorry I'm so sorry
1614000	1616000	good good mean
1616000	1618000	it
1618000	1620000	next time loki goes on to one of his
1620000	1622000	rants I'm just going to have that queued up
1622000	1624000	oh I did buy something on sale
1624000	1626000	on steam oh what
1626000	1628000	I bought bioshock infinite last night
1628000	1630000	oh yeah they've been having six bucks
1630000	1632000	uber sales 13 is 13
1632000	1634000	and also half life 2
1634000	1636000	is like
1636000	1638000	3 dollars so I picked that up for
1638000	1640000	pc so that
1640000	1642000	you know I don't have to hurt my
1642000	1644000	hand playing it on xbox
1646000	1648000	so yeah I've
1648000	1650000	I just pretty much oh yeah and of course
1650000	1652000	my crack my animal crack
1652000	1654000	animal crossing animal cracking
1654000	1656000	which just
1656000	1658000	to say I'm actually considering busting out
1658000	1660000	the gamecube again and
1660000	1662000	playing my double
1662000	1664000	2 no mori why not because you can
1664000	1666000	unlock the nes cartridges
1666000	1668000	well yeah well the one that I have
1668000	1670000	there were two versions that came out on
1670000	1672000	gamecube there was
1672000	1674000	double 2 no mori plus which is the one
1674000	1676000	I have which was what
1676000	1678000	then we got a better one in america after
1678000	1680000	that and so that one was re-released in japan
1680000	1682000	as e plus well wasn't the original
1682000	1684000	original n64
1684000	1686000	I was n64 and we never got that
1686000	1688000	no however the
1688000	1690000	the whole reason I bought the import version
1690000	1692000	was to help me practice learning
1692000	1694000	reading japanese
1694000	1696000	because my
1696000	1698000	reading comprehension is not all that
1698000	1700000	great I read very
1700000	1702000	slowly so it was to help me
1702000	1704000	learn to
1704000	1706000	read better and so I'm gonna
1706000	1708000	be starting with that and I'm also trying to find
1708000	1710000	kids books to help me practice reading
1710000	1712000	so yeah
1712000	1714000	I've been I'm probably gonna be sort of
1714000	1716000	doubling up on my animal crossing
1716000	1718000	in the next few weeks
1718000	1720000	um and
1720000	1722000	then um dan is

1734000	1736000	again I'm like you watch and you're
1736000	1738000	not touching the game because I'm playing animal crossing
1738000	1740000	and I
1740000	1742000	am still trying to get the
1742000	1744000	stupid kitchen island but none of the

1812000	1814000	Chell while you're still on my good
1814000	1816000	side how was your gaming week
1816000	1818000	oh you know pretty chill you know
1818000	1820000	when I get a free minute
1820000	1822000	usually during school months
1822000	1824000	I'm kind of a casual gamer
1824000	1826000	mostly been getting my pc game on
1826000	1828000	can I plug something on there
1828000	1830000	so there's
1830000	1832000	this one indie game coming out
1832000	1834000	I've only played the demo so far
1834000	1836000	but oh man you know it's
1836000	1838000	I think it's made
1838000	1840000	an RPG maker something very similar
1840000	1842000	it's called Undertale
1842000	1844000	and the lead creator is Toby Fox
1844000	1846000	man you know give money
1846000	1848000	to this developer any way
1848000	1850000	you can if he's walking by throw money at his head
1850000	1852000	because this was like just the demo
1852000	1854000	just blew me away it has all the emotional
1854000	1856000	punches of earthbound which I'm pretty partial
1856000	1858000	too what'd you say this guy's name was
1858000	1860000	Toby Fox oh that poor guy
1860000	1862000	you know has got to be getting asked what does the
1862000	1864000	fox say she is encouraging bags of pennies
1864000	1866000	to be flung at his head
1866000	1868000	he will thank you through the tears
1868000	1870000	cause you know
1870000	1872000	he had a kickstarter and you know that
1872000	1874000	closed but you know this comes out
1874000	1876000	buy it you will thank yourself after you
1876000	1878000	stop crying which maybe never
1878000	1880000	wait so is like crying laughter
1880000	1882000	or crying like this game is really sad
1882000	1884000	or crying like they punch you in the emotions
1884000	1886000	and not even necessarily sad but it's
1886000	1888000	a really beautiful unique game experience
1888000	1890000	the whole thing is you're this kid
1890000	1892000	lost in this kind of underground place so
1892000	1894000	you know earthbound kind of
1894000	1896000	so the combat
1896000	1898000	is kind of unique the combat system is
1898000	1900000	you can choose to spare a monster
1900000	1902000	or fight them
1902000	1904000	and the whole you know this has been kind of
1904000	1906000	done before but it affects how
1906000	1908000	people interact with you and
1908000	1910000	yeah no it's saying
1910000	1912000	what I love about it will
1912000	1914000	spoil it that's how much you need to go
1914000	1916000	out and like play the demo and yeah
1916000	1918000	throw money at him hopefully paper
1918000	1920000	that's fair because there's
1920000	1922000	like in the beginning
1922000	1924000	when I first played Journey and since the game
1924000	1926000	has been out for like over a year now I think
1926000	1928000	it's fair for me to spoil it especially
1928000	1930000	cause I think everybody knows this twist
1930000	1932000	I said it was best to go on a journey to not
1932000	1934000	know that it's secretly a multiplayer game
1934000	1936000	because that so
1936000	1938000	enriches the experience cause the twist in Journey is that
1938000	1940000	you're not alone on the journey
1940000	1942000	and you can't communicate with the other person
1942000	1944000	though except through little hums
1944000	1946000	and like I can't even
1946000	1948000	explain like it's really just something you have to
1948000	1950000	experience like the bond you
1950000	1952000	start to feel with this little
1952000	1954000	thing that
1954000	1956000	you know is a real person
1956000	1958000	but is it like it's so hard
1958000	1960000	to explain I'm like but it was one of those things
1960000	1962000	because I didn't know when I played it for the first
1962000	1964000	time that that was like the twist in the game
1964000	1966000	I was like I want everybody to play Journey
1966000	1968000	like that where they find out that twist
1968000	1970000	on their own and I think that kind of keeps it
1970000	1972000	like all the more shocking
1972000	1974000	I'm sorry you just
1974000	1976000	the chat room made me think of another game
1976000	1978000	I'm playing Mass Effect 3 again
1978000	1980000	of course of course you know emotional manipulation
1980000	1982000	I'm all for that
1982000	1984000	I've also you know I really
1984000	1986000	need to pick up the first Darkness but I've also been playing
1986000	1988000	Darkness 2 cause I'm
1988000	1990000	so topical and you know I really
1990000	1992000	I'm enjoying the gameplay
1992000	1994000	but mostly I'm playing it for Mike Patton's juicy
1994000	1996000	juicy voice
1996000	1998000	fair enough
1998000	2000000	yeah you know I know it's been set up and down
2000000	2002000	but no post production the man
2002000	2004000	is demonically good
2004000	2006000	awesome
2006000	2008000	alright well I'm sure
2008000	2010000	the indie scene supports
2010000	2012000	or loves the fact that you're plugging that
2012000	2014000	stuff so yeah by all means
2014000	2016000	is there a website that you know off the top of your head?
2016000	2018000	well they've got a Tumblr and
2018000	2020000	it's just search Undertale
2020000	2022000	they should pop up I think they've got an official site
2022000	2024000	but so far it's just got the demo
2024000	2026000	on it the Tumblr is mostly posting
2026000	2028000	fan art right now and updates which are kinda
2028000	2030000	sparse and you know
2030000	2032000	I'm doing this completely unprompted
2032000	2034000	which you know I might appreciate
2034000	2036000	a game kicked my way someday
2036000	2038000	fair enough
2038000	2040000	not naming any names Toby Fox
2040000	2042000	alright
2042000	2044000	alright well let's move on then
2044000	2046000	if that's everything Chell has for now
2046000	2048000	over to Loki, Loki how was your gaming week?
2048000	2050000	I just played Grand Theft Auto
2050000	2052000	oh Mass Effect
2052000	2054000	there's a shock
2054000	2056000	to be fair I see Tim Tripp
2056000	2058000	in the chat room says oh man I missed
2058000	2060000	the Mass Effect tiers that's kinda what prompted
2060000	2062000	Jamie to go down that path she was
2062000	2064000	she was provoked by chat
2064000	2066000	but yeah Grand Theft Auto Online
2066000	2068000	and how's that going? well I heard
2068000	2070000	it had kind of a rough start
2070000	2072000	well yeah like any MMO this
2072000	2074000	they pretty much ironed it out after about three days
2074000	2076000	so it's working
2076000	2078000	so just quickly like I'm sure a lot
2078000	2080000	of people have experienced first hand and done it but
2080000	2082000	what do you do in Grand Theft Auto Online
2082000	2084000	what's the game? well there's an actual
2084000	2086000	storyline that goes along with it so basically
2086000	2088000	your character comes a little Santos after
2088000	2090000	Lamar which is Franklin's
2090000	2092000	friend in the single player game
2092000	2094000	he like follows you on Life Invader
2094000	2096000	which is their version of Facebook and
2096000	2098000	so he comes and you come into town and you're
2098000	2100000	doing jobs for different people they have
2100000	2102000	a guy Simeon that you're doing
2102000	2104000	repos for there's
2104000	2106000	some other guys that you're
2106000	2108000	doing like drug stuff for
2108000	2110000	getting you know stealing
2110000	2112000	meth from people and
2112000	2114000	that's just like the missions and then
2114000	2116000	on top of all that you can do the free
2116000	2118000	roaming stuff or you can rob liquor stores
2118000	2120000	you can steal cars
2120000	2122000	you can just
2122000	2124000	shoot people you know one on one do that stuff
2124000	2126000	or there's races, death
2126000	2128000	matches
2128000	2130000	you can do skydiving
2130000	2132000	stuff a whole bunch of
2132000	2134000	different activities in the game
2134000	2136000	and it's up to 16 players
2136000	2138000	and you get randomly thrown in
2138000	2140000	with some people usually
2140000	2142000	and then on top of that you can do these death
2142000	2144000	matches and stuff with other people so
2144000	2146000	a lot of times what I've found is I'm
2146000	2148000	getting dumped in a game I'll go do a mission or something
2148000	2150000	I'll come back and it's not the same people in the same
2150000	2152000	you know world anymore it's like
2152000	2154000	a whole different set of people
2154000	2156000	did you have something to add to that Chell?
2156000	2158000	I was just gonna say
2158000	2160000	kids don't take drugs
2160000	2162000	buy your own
2162000	2164000	don't
2164000	2166000	say that
2166000	2168000	but I've been enjoying it so far and you get to
2168000	2170000	create how your character looks based off of
2170000	2172000	like your ancestry and stuff
2172000	2174000	they have different people
2174000	2176000	that you pick as your grandparents
2176000	2178000	and your parents and then
2178000	2180000	or you pick the grandparents and that alters
2180000	2182000	what the parents look like and then
2182000	2184000	that alters what you look like
2184000	2186000	and I heard and I was reading an email
2186000	2188000	a little bit ahead of the game so I apologize
2188000	2190000	to the emailer I'm gonna spoil a little bit of their email
2190000	2192000	but I heard you can be a woman
2192000	2194000	in Grand Theft Auto Online
2194000	2196000	so that kind of helps the whole like you can never
2196000	2198000	be one but you can in Grand Theft Auto Online
2198000	2200000	yeah well you could
2200000	2202000	in 4 as well you could play a female
2202000	2204000	character in 4 for the online stuff
2204000	2206000	and of course your character is silent
2206000	2208000	so you know it's
2208000	2210000	whatever but yeah it's been a lot of fun
2210000	2212000	I've been enjoying it there's been a few people
2212000	2214000	that I've played with and stuff on there
2214000	2216000	but you know there's the
2216000	2218000	occasional kids
2218000	2220000	that are on there and stuff like I've had
2220000	2222000	a few people try to come kill me and it's great
2222000	2224000	cause you know that they're trying to kill you cause you see
2224000	2226000	them like I'm going to the store to go buy some
2226000	2228000	guns or something like that and I see this
2228000	2230000	guy just like posting up outside
2230000	2232000	and trying to hide and stuff and
2232000	2234000	it's funny cause they try to come in and shoot
2234000	2236000	me but you can't shoot in the store cause
2236000	2238000	when you walk in the store your gun disappears
2238000	2240000	so they have to wait outside the store
2240000	2242000	and so I know they're doing that so
2242000	2244000	immediately when I go out there I switch my gun and
2244000	2246000	I shoot them cause I'm like
2246000	2248000	so you shoot kids is what you're saying here on the show
2248000	2250000	I'm shooting kids playing the game
2250000	2252000	Loki is the
2252000	2254000	Loki is the enforcement to keep kids out of
2254000	2256000	Grand Theft Auto if he sees a child
2256000	2258000	playing Grand Theft Auto he will shoot them
2258000	2260000	but you can you can
2260000	2262000	you can do all sorts of things you can buy property
2262000	2264000	in the game and garages and
2264000	2266000	you can customize your cars and the way you look
2266000	2268000	and it just it's
2268000	2270000	kind of fun it's just this whole leveling up
2270000	2272000	system and stuff and you level up your stats
2272000	2274000	based on what you're doing in the game
2274000	2276000	so
2276000	2278000	I don't know I'm enjoying it I've been playing both on
2278000	2280000	PS3 and 360
2280000	2282000	the PS3 I'm on level 12 cause
2282000	2284000	I've been playing that mostly because my co-workers
2284000	2286000	say oh yeah I get the PS3 version we're gonna
2286000	2288000	be totally on there playing PS3 yeah
2288000	2290000	not a single one of them on PS3
2290000	2292000	so I may go back to 360 again
2292000	2294000	and level up my character there but
2294000	2296000	you know we have the
2296000	2298000	crew it's open we've got our
2298000	2300000	fun little logo there and stuff so
2300000	2302000	Rockstar Social Club look for crews look for
2302000	2304000	VoG Network and you can sign up
2304000	2306000	and come play with us I
2306000	2308000	guess there you go all right
2308000	2310000	well moving on to my gaming week I'll
2310000	2312000	go last and honestly there wasn't a lot to
2312000	2314000	it I have really just been playing Final Fantasy
2314000	2316000	14 this entire week just like
2316000	2318000	Logan's been playing Grand Theft Auto Online I've
2318000	2320000	pretty much only been playing Final Fantasy 14
2320000	2322000	I'm in the end game now I'm a level 50 white
2322000	2324000	mage and I'm kind of doing the stuff that you do at
2324000	2326000	end game which is running
2326000	2328000	you know CM and AK
2328000	2330000	and Praetorium and all that
2330000	2332000	to get my seal or my
2332000	2334000	I keep saying seals but they're tomes
2334000	2336000	actually and that's really mostly what I've
2336000	2338000	been doing I gotta say though I was really impressed
2338000	2340000	with the ending I'm using my
2340000	2342000	quotey fingers because you know it's an MMO it doesn't really
2342000	2344000	end but Final Fantasy 14 has
2344000	2346000	a pretty definitive
2346000	2348000	story from start to finish and when
2348000	2350000	you finish the actual story you get like
2350000	2352000	this 25 minute ending and I gotta
2352000	2354000	say I was happy with
2354000	2356000	it and it's simple
2356000	2358000	but it's effective like for somebody
2358000	2360000	that's really invested a lot of time in the game
2360000	2362000	I was like I really get the sense
2362000	2364000	that I accomplished something
2364000	2366000	and now I see what's next for my character
2366000	2368000	and that's such a great feeling playing an MMO
2368000	2370000	which usually doesn't
2370000	2372000	ever end
2372000	2374000	so yeah that's really all I can say
2374000	2376000	I can't really talk about a lot of other games I will
2376000	2378000	say I did pick
2378000	2380000	up a new toy the other day I did
2380000	2382000	pick up a new HD
2382000	2384000	game capture card or I should
2384000	2386000	say more like a box it's more a box it's like
2386000	2388000	a USB connected thing and I am really
2388000	2390000	excited because I purposely wanted to get
2390000	2392000	something that would do the new consoles through HDMI
2392000	2394000	and this does the old
2394000	2396000	consoles because the
2396000	2398000	component doubles as a composite
2398000	2400000	plugin so I am really excited
2400000	2402000	to stream a variety
2402000	2404000	of stuff as soon as I can get it working with my
2404000	2406000	laptop and all that so
2406000	2408000	that's something in the future
2408000	2410000	in the coming weeks so I
2410000	2412000	will be able to diversify things
2412000	2414000	a little more than just playing the same MMO all week
2414000	2416000	long I'm going to force myself to do that
2416000	2418000	I've been very busy with personal life
2418000	2420000	stuff Rocky Horror which I'm
2420000	2422000	directing is this coming
2422000	2424000	Saturday so as you can imagine I'm
2424000	2426000	super busy with that I wouldn't know anything about playing
2426000	2428000	all games to the exception
2428000	2430000	of all else
2430000	2432000	and how many hours have you spent on Mass Effect?
2432000	2434000	shut up 3 digits or 4 now
2434000	2436000	alright
2436000	2438000	alrighty that's enough
2438000	2440000	for our gaming weeks quickly some
2440000	2442000	housekeeping actually
2442000	2444000	I actually have things for housekeeping tonight
2444000	2446000	I want to plug another podcast I was on today
2446000	2448000	and thank them for having me check out
2448000	2450000	the Let's Wow podcast
2450000	2452000	that is World of Warcraft
2452000	2454000	so yes I still dabble in World of Warcraft even though
2454000	2456000	I've talked about a lot of Final Fantasy 14
2456000	2458000	lately but I did guest on their show tonight
2458000	2460000	that's episode number 31
2460000	2462000	and you can check that out that will be in their archive soon
2462000	2464000	available on iTunes and Stitcher
2464000	2466000	and all that again that's the Let's Wow podcast
2466000	2468000	thank you kids for having me on and we talked about
2468000	2470000	World of Warcraft and other MMOs
2470000	2472000	and I razzed my good buddy
2472000	2474000	Gemet for a good 500
2474000	2476000	minutes
2476000	2478000	let's see other things I want to plug
2478000	2480000	it is that time of year again
2480000	2482000	where a lot of podcasts
2482000	2484000	are going to be asking you to vote for them
2484000	2486000	in the podcast awards
2486000	2488000	which is right now kind of what we have
2488000	2490000	in the little podcast industry to recognize
2490000	2492000	the podcast media
2492000	2494000	sometimes
2494000	2496000	I'm a little iffy on how I feel
2496000	2498000	with it all being kind of a popularity
2498000	2500000	contest at the end of the day but
2500000	2502000	I will say being able to
2502000	2504000	be nominated for it and
2504000	2506000	collect the votes and stuff is
2506000	2508000	really good promotion for us
2508000	2510000	and it's always really
2510000	2512000	nice to be able to
2512000	2514000	kind of share in that with other
2514000	2516000	gaming podcasts that really
2516000	2518000	work hard for what they do so I hope we
2518000	2520000	will get that honor again this year
2520000	2522000	to be in the podcast awards but if we
2522000	2524000	aren't we're still going to do what we do

2526000	2528000	would encourage you podcastawards.com

2594000	2596000	the Xbox One
2596000	2598000	it was
2598000	2600000	I guess put out there this
2600000	2602000	last week that it's going to take
2602000	2604000	about 15 to 20 minutes to download
2604000	2606000	the Xbox One day one patch
2606000	2608000	so expect a short delay before
2608000	2610000	you get into your gaming
2610000	2612000	which if I remember
2612000	2614000	quickly I believe that is a lot
2614000	2616000	less of a wait than
2616000	2618000	you had to for the Wii U
2618000	2620000	wasn't that Wii U
2620000	2622000	day one patch like
2622000	2624000	an hour or something? well that's because
2624000	2626000	Nintendo's download servers are slow
2626000	2628000	as hell like I don't know
2628000	2630000	well I think they've gotten a lot better
2630000	2632000	but remember all the crazy Nintendo
2632000	2634000	fanboys were all hammering that thing at the same time
2634000	2636000	I mean not that it excuses it but
2636000	2638000	it's the reason why it was downloading slow
2638000	2640000	alright
2640000	2642000	and then I was going to talk real quick
2642000	2644000	because I actually had noticed this and I posted
2644000	2646000	it on Twitter earlier this week
2646000	2648000	about the
2648000	2650000	next gen digital file
2650000	2652000	sizes holy shit
2652000	2654000	so there's
2654000	2656000	some new SKUs that are coming out for a bunch of
2656000	2658000	different things and I don't know why
2658000	2660000	I guess they're just trying to get people to
2660000	2662000	buy in on this stuff but like NBA2K
2662000	2664000	14 they have a super
2664000	2666000	fan pack and also for
2666000	2668000	Call of Duty Ghost they have
2668000	2670000	an Xbox edition
2670000	2672000	and what these two
2672000	2674000	things are is they're digital
2674000	2676000	they're retail items that are digital
2676000	2678000	that you go to the store and buy
2678000	2680000	this packaging and it comes with codes for both the
2680000	2682000	Xbox 360 version and the
2682000	2684000	Xbox One version or in the case
2684000	2686000	of NBA2K the Xbox
2686000	2688000	360, Xbox One version or
2688000	2690000	PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4 version
2692000	2694000	the fine print though tells you how big
2694000	2696000	those files are like how
2696000	2698000	much hard drive space you need so
2698000	2700000	it's not a big surprise that the current gen stuff
2700000	2702000	is anywhere from 8 to 10 gigs
2702000	2704000	the next gen stuff and this is
2704000	2706000	kind of like you know imagine if they
2706000	2708000	went that way where they were trying to really push digital
2708000	2710000	60 gigabytes
2710000	2712000	60
2712000	2714000	that's a long fucking time
2714000	2716000	to download that I mean that is a good
2716000	2718000	like even on my good internet connection
2718000	2720000	about 15 hours
2720000	2722000	that's a lot of HD stuff
2722000	2724000	and I mean
2724000	2726000	isn't it still out there these caps
2726000	2728000	on bandwidth that people get in a month
2728000	2730000	I think there might be some I think Comcast
2730000	2732000	suspended theirs for a little while and they were going to
2732000	2734000	up it to 300 gigs but still
2734000	2736000	imagine Comcast up their thing to 300 gigs
2736000	2738000	that's like six games in a month
2738000	2740000	which I guess that is a lot but
2740000	2742000	I mean and then nothing else on your internet
2742000	2744000	so let's be real it's still
2744000	2746000	I mean that's a long time to wait for something
2746000	2748000	digitally and yeah I understand that they do
2748000	2750000	have the technology where that they can start
2750000	2752000	streaming the game after a certain
2752000	2754000	amount of it's downloaded but shit
2754000	2756000	even if it's half of it that's still eight hours
2756000	2758000	that you have to wait before you can start playing
2758000	2760000	that game and
2760000	2762000	if that's something that you're planning on buying
2762000	2764000	at launch you know you
2764000	2766000	might as well just buy
2766000	2768000	the disc I mean cause really the
2768000	2770000	cost savings of it isn't very
2770000	2772000	significant cause basically this
2772000	2774000	pack is like 100 bucks if you get the two
2774000	2776000	games so you're really only saving like
2776000	2778000	20 bucks maybe you know
2778000	2780000	the fact that you're basically pre-ordering
2780000	2782000	this you know quite in advance and you have
2782000	2784000	to buy digital copies for both so you can't actually
2784000	2786000	trade them in whereas some of these places
2786000	2788000	I'm sure will allow you to trade in like say your
2788000	2790000	NBA 2K copy on
2790000	2792000	360 get you know maybe 40
2792000	2794000	bucks back or something like that you know
2794000	2796000	it's not that far out and
2796000	2798000	you know buy the next gen version for
2798000	2800000	20 bucks or something I still
2800000	2802000	think it'd be cheaper than having
2802000	2804000	the download all that shit I mean that's just
2804000	2806000	that's ridiculous and especially
2806000	2808000	since they're trying to push that it
2808000	2810000	one of the reasons
2810000	2812000	why the you know their big
2812000	2814000	ideas of making this all digital world is just
2814000	2816000	not feasible right now with
2816000	2818000	our internet infrastructure
2818000	2820000	it's just not gonna work
2820000	2822000	so that's it
2822000	2824000	well what do you think though if the console life cycle
2824000	2826000	is like 10 years or whatever do you
2826000	2828000	think that maybe in that amount of time
2828000	2830000	we will be at that point?
2830000	2832000	Possibly I mean it's gonna take some sort of
2832000	2834000	I think government funding
2834000	2836000	to kind of
2836000	2838000	put you know
2838000	2840000	I guess get these companies
2840000	2842000	to want to improve their infrastructure
2842000	2844000	cause right now a lot of these companies have
2844000	2846000	monopolies in the different areas and so
2846000	2848000	there's really no
2848000	2850000	no need for them to try to get their
2850000	2852000	internet speeds faster just like you know with
2852000	2854000	Comcast I was trying to get this one plan
2854000	2856000	that they had that was 70 bucks
2856000	2858000	cause I pay about 60, 70 dollars
2858000	2860000	right now for just internet it's in a
2860000	2862000	different area where it's double the internet speed that
2862000	2864000	I have now plus cable
2864000	2866000	for the same price and
2866000	2868000	of course
2868000	2870000	oh I'm sorry that plan's not in our area
2870000	2872000	of course
2872000	2874000	it's just that's the problem
2874000	2876000	there's monopolies everywhere so you're not gonna
2876000	2878000	they're not gonna be in a big hurry to
2878000	2880000	offer faster internet
2880000	2882000	without some sort of government funding because
2882000	2884000	why bother spending the money
2884000	2886000	to upgrade our service when we can just charge more
2886000	2888000	and you know keep the same level
2888000	2890000	of service or decline it
2890000	2892000	alright well one thing people
2892000	2894000	were using their bandwidth for this week was
2894000	2896000	to watch the latest Nintendo Direct
2896000	2898000	you know Nintendo likes to do these where
2898000	2900000	they just take the news they take their case straight to
2900000	2902000	their hardcore fan base and
2902000	2904000	it's been working for better or worse for them
2904000	2906000	they unveiled the latest
2906000	2908000	Nintendo Direct on October 1st which kind
2908000	2910000	of ran down here's where Nintendo's at for the
2910000	2912000	end of the year one big
2912000	2914000	shocker maybe not I don't know
2914000	2916000	depending on what you think of these things there was
2916000	2918000	a delay Donkey Kong Country Tropical
2918000	2920000	Freeze moving to
2920000	2922000	2014 it will not make the holiday
2922000	2924000	season this was one of their big holiday
2924000	2926000	things they were hyping but unfortunately
2926000	2928000	Donkey Kong Country did move
2928000	2930000	to February 2014 is
2930000	2932000	when this game is coming out
2932000	2934000	I'm gonna go out on a limb
2934000	2936000	and say that this is strategy
2936000	2938000	that I don't know if this was necessarily
2938000	2940000	because the game's not done
2940000	2942000	but this was maybe to buff up
2942000	2944000	2014
2944000	2946000	next or this coming winter
2946000	2948000	where things didn't work out
2948000	2950000	so well in 2013 I think you're right
2950000	2952000	because they had too much stuff coming out and
2952000	2954000	there's the fourth quarter there's too much stuff coming out
2954000	2956000	Nintendo themselves they have We Fit
2956000	2958000	You in the beginning of November
2958000	2960000	and then they have Super Mario 3D
2960000	2962000	World coming out at the end of November
2962000	2964000	and this was originally gonna be like
2964000	2966000	a couple weeks later in the early part
2966000	2968000	of December right and I think
2968000	2970000	this could also mean and I'm definitely
2970000	2972000	tinfoil hatting here a bit so don't you know
2972000	2974000	take what I say with a grain of salt here but
2974000	2976000	this could mean that Mario Kart 8 is
2976000	2978000	bumped back a little bit because what Mario Kart 8
2978000	2980000	they had said March before right?
2980000	2982000	I'm thinking
2982000	2984000	I'm thinking more like April at this
2984000	2986000	point and maybe there's something happening there
2986000	2988000	where they want to strategically spread
2988000	2990000	out the first party releases plus
2990000	2992000	I don't think there are a lot of releases
2992000	2994000	on the Wii U right now we're running
2994000	2996000	in the same situation we did last year
2996000	2998000	where there was nothing coming out for a few months
2998000	3000000	and I think that's what we're gonna see now
3000000	3002000	I definitely know there's nothing
3002000	3004000	coming out in December and there's nothing
3004000	3006000	coming out right now in
3006000	3008000	January. Well how does Xbox One and PlayStation
3008000	3010000	4 look for next year in the winter?
3010000	3012000	I mean aren't they gonna be the ones that are kinda
3012000	3014000	hurting for games in the winter? I think that
3014000	3016000	they're gonna run I think everyone's gonna run in the same
3016000	3018000	situation but right now we don't have a firm
3018000	3020000	lineup for what we have for you know
3020000	3022000	the first quarter of the year
3022000	3024000	so it's still
3024000	3026000	they haven't really announced that stuff you know probably
3026000	3028000	later on into
3028000	3030000	the fourth quarter we'll know that because
3030000	3032000	you know right now their focus is on the
3032000	3034000	fourth quarter so I don't think anything's gonna
3034000	3036000	get delayed to the you know
3036000	3038000	beginning part of the year but they still haven't made their announcements
3038000	3040000	of what titles they have coming like you know
3040000	3042000	EA hasn't announced what they really have coming aside
3042000	3044000	from you know
3044000	3046000	was it
3046000	3048000	yeah but EA's not a factor on Wii U either
3048000	3050000	true yeah very true
3050000	3052000	unfortunately
3052000	3054000	I know but even like other companies like there's
3054000	3056000	just no big titles have been announced
3056000	3058000	yeah at least not a lot of titles for
3058000	3060000	February well what up G says Titanfall
3060000	3062000	is next spring right I guess that's a big one
3062000	3064000	I think that's more summer I don't think that's
3064000	3066000	coming out in spring at all you think Destiny's gonna be that
3066000	3068000	same time frame too I know that's a big one I think Destiny's yeah
3068000	3070000	maybe fourth quarter that it's
3070000	3072000	second half of the or at least second quarter I think
3072000	3074000	fair enough going to our chat room at
3074000	3076000	live.vognetwork.com
3076000	3078000	SHJ100Matt says further proves that their whole
3078000	3080000	E3 conference video just showed
3080000	3082000	2014 games
3082000	3084000	CaptainSpike says absolutely gutted
3084000	3086000	about Donkey Kong one of my most anticipated
3086000	3088000	games of 2013
3088000	3090000	well at least you're
3090000	3092000	still getting a solid platformer in the form
3092000	3094000	of Super Mario 3D World which
3094000	3096000	some of the early previews are coming back very
3096000	3098000	positive which is no surprise at all
3098000	3100000	I mean you know a lot of the Mario
3100000	3102000	games are very strong performers I can't
3102000	3104000	think I what was the last one that people
3104000	3106000	didn't like Sunshine
3106000	3108000	that was a while ago Hotel Mario
3108000	3110000	what's that Hotel Mario
3110000	3112000	Hotel that's a long time ago hey Sunshine was fun
3112000	3114000	yeah Sunshine still has its
3114000	3116000	defenders I like Sunshine actually
3116000	3118000	myself so
3118000	3120000	I mean most Mario platformers aren't bad
3120000	3122000	they just aren't I mean there's been some
3122000	3124000	that are like that's okay but
3124000	3126000	some most of them are very very good
3126000	3128000	so
3128000	3130000	that's at least you got a solid
3130000	3132000	platformer in that to look forward to
3132000	3134000	in November now in Japan and Europe
3134000	3136000	Sonic will be
3136000	3138000	coming to Super Smash Brothers
3138000	3140000	whatever they call it which well
3140000	3142000	I was I see you rolling your eyes over there Loki
3142000	3144000	I was actually a little surprised because of the fact
3144000	3146000	it's a third party character I didn't think they'd
3146000	3148000	recycle those but I guess
3148000	3150000	cause Nintendo's not publishing
3150000	3152000	Mario and Sonic at the Olympics
3152000	3154000	I guess
3154000	3156000	this is not surprising at all
3156000	3158000	that's about surprising oh hey Luigi's in this
3158000	3160000	game oh alright
3160000	3162000	fair enough more surprising they said he wasn't in the game
3162000	3164000	next up character
3164000	3166000	Scarlet Witch
3166000	3168000	let's hope
3168000	3170000	let's see and
3170000	3172000	Pikmin 3 is getting DLC
3172000	3174000	Nintendo's kind of further going down
3174000	3176000	the DLC spiral with
3176000	3178000	Pikmin 3 DLC but a lot of people looking
3178000	3180000	forward to it and you know I gotta say the Super
3180000	3182000	Luigi U was
3182000	3184000	pretty good so I mean if Nintendo
3184000	3186000	can keep making robust DLC packages
3186000	3188000	like that this isn't a bad thing at all
3188000	3190000	also some folks very excited
3190000	3192000	I'm sure Act Deft was screaming
3192000	3194000	shaking crying and convulsing
3194000	3196000	over the fact that there is a new Kirby
3196000	3198000	game on its way to the 3DS
3198000	3200000	as if the 3DS
3200000	3202000	needed more powerhouse games but here's
3202000	3204000	another one Kirby's on its way
3204000	3206000	and Loki's going yup yup that's what I was
3206000	3208000	saying like you know all these announcements like wow
3208000	3210000	more great titles for the 3DS and then like
3210000	3212000	but when people are like Nintendo's
3212000	3214000	dying Nintendo's gonna go under
3214000	3216000	it's like the 3DS
3216000	3218000	is like
3218000	3220000	da bomb right now like you can't
3220000	3222000	I mean yes the 3DS in the
3222000	3224000	beginning little shaky but now
3224000	3226000	you've got it like if you play
3226000	3228000	handheld games at all the 3DS
3228000	3230000	we've already established on the 3DS
3230000	3232000	for 3D anymore and now we have two
3232000	3234000	screens one that's HD one that's a touch
3234000	3236000	screen just fucking put it on the Wii U
3236000	3238000	already god dammit it's gonna happen
3238000	3240000	eventually it's just
3240000	3242000	make that announcement and then done then you don't have to worry
3242000	3244000	about content because you have a ton of fucking
3244000	3246000	games already on the 3DS
3246000	3248000	that could be on the Wii U
3248000	3250000	alright I don't understand it a game I am
3250000	3252000	very excited about also on the 3DS
3252000	3254000	speaking of powerhouse games I can't think of
3254000	3256000	anything for me more a powerhouse than
3256000	3258000	Zelda A Link Between Worlds
3258000	3260000	which is coming out November 22nd
3260000	3262000	this is the spiritual successor of
3262000	3264000	sorts to Link to the Past from Super
3264000	3266000	Nintendo which holds a place near and dear
3266000	3268000	in my heart and I'm sure many of you out there
3268000	3270000	one thing they announced about the game that's
3270000	3272000	very interesting the dungeons can be played
3272000	3274000	in any order
3274000	3276000	which is not common
3276000	3278000	for the Zelda games usually without
3278000	3280000	certain items you can't get to places but like
3280000	3282000	in the early like the first Zelda
3282000	3284000	game you could run into level
3284000	3286000	you know some of the later levels
3286000	3288000	if you had a bomb you could probably go all the way
3288000	3290000	to level 9 right at the beginning right
3290000	3292000	you might need a ladder some of us have made the mistake
3292000	3294000	of doing that the first time we found it by accident
3294000	3296000	and went what the hell dead
3296000	3298000	so I would imagine there's
3298000	3300000	still gonna be an optimal order just like
3300000	3302000	in any Mega Man game or something but
3302000	3304000	the cool thing is it'll kinda open it up
3304000	3306000	for the speed runners and people
3306000	3308000	that like to bend the rules a little bit to
3308000	3310000	try different patterns so that'll be pretty cool
3310000	3312000	yeah I'm just looking forward to it
3312000	3314000	you know being just a smash hit and
3314000	3316000	quieting the people who will not
3316000	3318000	shut up about Ocarina
3318000	3320000	of Time slash Majora's Mask
3320000	3322000	look guys we all love those games
3322000	3324000	they're not the only Zelda games come on
3324000	3326000	thank you will you give me a
3326000	3328000	fist bump for that statement thank you very much
3328000	3330000	thank you like I you know
3330000	3332000	I understand those games Ocarina
3332000	3334000	and they have their place but
3334000	3336000	for me Link to the Past oh my gosh
3336000	3338000	I give a clump just thinking about how great that
3338000	3340000	game is I've got a gold cart
3340000	3342000	Ocarina of Time I agree with you
3342000	3344000	fair enough
3344000	3346000	alright I knew I liked having you on the show
3346000	3348000	alright so that is out of course
3348000	3350000	November 22nd and lastly I'll mention this
3350000	3352000	the 3DS StreetPass system
3352000	3354000	the relay points
3354000	3356000	that they instituted recently like at Starbucks
3356000	3358000	where you can actually street pass people
3358000	3360000	at Starbucks because what happens is that
3360000	3362000	when you go there
3362000	3364000	whoever was last there their data is
3364000	3366000	on the little machine waiting for you
3366000	3368000	to get it on your 3DS well they're gonna
3368000	3370000	upgrade these relay points six
3370000	3372000	people now will be on these
3372000	3374000	things so if you go to Starbucks you can get up to six
3374000	3376000	people on these things that's even better
3376000	3378000	because I mean I actually do go to the
3378000	3380000	like there's this one that Becky and I
3380000	3382000	go to like at least twice a week
3382000	3384000	yeah I know that's great that's awesome news
3384000	3386000	and some content distribution
3386000	3388000	events are planned for use
3388000	3390000	over the relay so
3390000	3392000	interesting
3392000	3394000	very cool stuff I guess it'll push demos
3394000	3396000	through to your 3DS if you opt in for it
3396000	3398000	so that'll be really cool
3398000	3400000	Dark Soccer I think you have more Nintendo
3400000	3402000	stuff for us right? But I'm putting my
3402000	3404000	island up yes I do have other news
3404000	3406000	thank you ActDeft because I've
3406000	3408000	really been wanting an island for a while
3408000	3410000	well how about
3410000	3412000	the new Wii U
3412000	3414000	firmware is also going to have a bunch
3414000	3416000	of other features now it's gonna be
3416000	3418000	700 megabytes so
3418000	3420000	it's gonna take a while to download
3420000	3422000	but it has internet browser
3422000	3424000	updates it has
3424000	3426000	more demos and trial
3426000	3428000	software USB keyboard support
3428000	3430000	Dolby Pro Logic 2
3430000	3432000	smartphones will be able
3432000	3434000	to connect to the
3434000	3436000	Nintendo network ID
3436000	3438000	you can view a friends list from the Wii U menu
3438000	3440000	you have your headset
3440000	3442000	that can hook to the gamepad and be used
3442000	3444000	for chat and you can read
3444000	3446000	PDF files on the Wii U
3446000	3448000	and you can also save your passwords
3448000	3450000	for websites so
3450000	3452000	lots of stuff
3452000	3454000	you also have to accept a new license agreement
3454000	3456000	I'm telling you this because I just updated
3456000	3458000	my Wii U not that long ago
3458000	3460000	I also want to put this PSA out there
3460000	3462000	those Wii U updates can take a little while
3462000	3464000	especially because it was what like 700 megabytes
3464000	3466000	that's what I was saying
3466000	3468000	so put on a movie
3468000	3470000	call your mom
3470000	3472000	my point is don't wait until
3472000	3474000	the day Mario 3D
3474000	3476000	comes out to do this
3476000	3478000	like if you're listening to my voice
3478000	3480000	and you haven't done this yet you probably just want to go turn
3480000	3482000	that guy on right now and just let the update be over
3482000	3484000	and done with and then be ready for
3484000	3486000	Zelda Wind Waker HD or whatever the next game
3486000	3488000	is you're going to get
3488000	3490000	or get up in the morning have an update and call your mom
3490000	3492000	or whichever relative
3492000	3494000	you have living right now
3494000	3496000	fair enough, fair enough
3496000	3498000	talk to them
3498000	3500000	and go outside and get some fresh air
3500000	3502000	get a job, wait I need to get a job
3502000	3504000	alright Loki
3504000	3506000	alright
3506000	3508000	so let's see here let's talk a little bit about
3508000	3510000	PlayStation 3 getting its own
3510000	3512000	firmware update as well
3512000	3514000	4.5 finally came out
3514000	3516000	and what it does is adds the
3516000	3518000	auto downloads
3518000	3520000	to people that are not in
3520000	3522000	PlayStation Plus so you'll be able to
3522000	3524000	also transfer data between your
3524000	3526000	PlayStation 3 and Vita versus
3526000	3528000	via Wi-Fi
3528000	3530000	and ethernet connections I guess
3530000	3532000	originally you could only do it through the transfer cable that they had
3532000	3534000	and
3534000	3536000	also lets you
3536000	3538000	set up I guess groups
3538000	3540000	of players that can
3540000	3542000	see your trophies so you can
3542000	3544000	either have that open to everybody I don't know why you wouldn't
3544000	3546000	why you would hide your trophies from
3546000	3548000	people unless there was like a trophy
3548000	3550000	for going to the strip club a lot of times
3550000	3552000	and Grand Theft Auto 5 or something you know I don't
3552000	3554000	know well
3554000	3556000	remember when I was getting
3556000	3558000	all those achievements in Dance Dance Revolution
3558000	3560000	Universe because I had it like the day it came out
3560000	3562000	and I started playing it right away and I got a
3562000	3564000	message from what was his name
3564000	3566000	that guy who had all the achievements
3566000	3568000	he ended up getting banned from Xbox
3568000	3570000	because it turns out they were a strip club DJ
3570000	3572000	that was his name he sent me a message like
3572000	3574000	how are getting the achievements in that game
3574000	3576000	what's the difficulty like
3576000	3578000	like I don't even know how he found me I think he used one of
3578000	3580000	those like websites that shows you like
3580000	3582000	who's doing well in achievements and I think
3582000	3584000	at that moment in time I had more
3584000	3586000	achievement points in that game than anyone else
3586000	3588000	I mean like on release day so
3588000	3590000	maybe if I'm in that situation
3590000	3592000	and again I want to hide trophies
3592000	3594000	oh it just occurred to me
3594000	3596000	if I'm reviewing games
3596000	3598000	people might ask me to turn that feature on
3598000	3600000	to not spoil because a lot of the trophy lists
3600000	3602000	leak from review copies
3602000	3604000	so maybe that's to encourage
3604000	3606000	critics and so forth to not leak it
3606000	3608000	I bet that would be one
3608000	3610000	anyways they have it
3610000	3612000	so
3612000	3614000	cool but yeah so basically
3614000	3616000	so the auto download is kind of cool
3616000	3618000	about time everybody gets that
3618000	3620000	here's the thing okay and this isn't really a playstation
3620000	3622000	but like you know speaking of
3622000	3624000	system updates and stuff fucking 360
3624000	3626000	man every time I log in live
3626000	3628000	now I'm still getting that fucking prompt
3628000	3630000	to add a second like
3630000	3632000	a second method to confirm my passwords
3632000	3634000	or stuff if I need to
3634000	3636000	you know like a second way they can contact
3636000	3638000	me basically and I've filled it out
3638000	3640000	a bunch of times
3640000	3642000	and I've even filled it out either via
3642000	3644000	you know texting via email
3644000	3646000	and it still fucking says oh
3646000	3648000	sorry you only have one form to
3648000	3650000	contact you are you okay with this
3650000	3652000	I'm like yes I'm okay with this nope sorry
3652000	3654000	you need to please add another
3654000	3656000	way to contact us that's weird and I even did it through
3656000	3658000	the website they have a special website you go
3658000	3660000	to to confirm that because obviously it says
3660000	3662000	oh yeah you can go ahead and
3662000	3664000	add it through this oh I'm sorry actually no you can't
3664000	3666000	add it through this you have to go onto this
3666000	3668000	website to do it and I did that and
3668000	3670000	it confirmed it and it still
3670000	3672000	fucking doesn't work and I get prompted every
3672000	3674000	fucking time I log in you need to call Microsoft or something
3674000	3676000	it's not like something's wrong fucking flip
3676000	3678000	them off is what I need to do aren't
3678000	3680000	you kind of doing that right now
3682000	3684000	because Microsoft executives
3684000	3686000	right now and their tech supporter
3686000	3688000	listening to the show and going oh
3688000	3690000	no one customer is having a problem
3690000	3692000	well I'm a
3692000	3694000	customer that has a podcast
3694000	3696000	fear me he's a loud
3696000	3698000	ass customer let's be real dark
3698000	3700000	sakura so are you
3700000	3702000	everyone has a voice that's right
3702000	3704000	and we use our voice to say fuck you
3704000	3706000	alright
3706000	3708000	speaking of like consoles
3708000	3710000	and things one console will be going
3710000	3712000	away rest in peace
3712000	3714000	bye it's
3714000	3716000	Nintendo's Wii believe it or not Nintendo's
3716000	3718000	Wii will be ending production
3718000	3720000	soon in Japan
3720000	3722000	so we don't have any
3722000	3724000	worry about you know the US or other
3724000	3726000	territories Canada Europe we don't know but
3726000	3728000	in Japan let's be
3728000	3730000	real the Wii isn't selling so hot anymore
3730000	3732000	985
3732000	3734000	Wii units were sold in a week which
3734000	3736000	really isn't a lot so the Wii is going
3736000	3738000	to be fading to black and
3738000	3740000	it kind of makes sense for Nintendo like
3740000	3742000	you know push the Wii U make people buy
3742000	3744000	that to play the games make
3744000	3746000	sense for them so yep they'll be
3746000	3748000	sunsetting the Wii and I
3748000	3750000	I wouldn't I would bet that maybe
3750000	3752000	trying to push the Wii U a little harder
3752000	3754000	especially in a year where
3754000	3756000	in Japan there's no competition
3756000	3758000	isn't exactly a bad
3758000	3760000	move so
3760000	3762000	nice knowing you Wii
3762000	3764000	good not to have yourself as competition
3764000	3766000	right because well in a way
3766000	3768000	that's what Nintendo would have right now in Japan
3768000	3770000	if you think about it in terms of production
3770000	3772000	cost making a machine that no one's buying
3772000	3774000	then yeah
3774000	3776000	there's no need to keep putting the production
3776000	3778000	money into it when you could be
3778000	3780000	using it for Wii U I mean what is going to be
3780000	3782000	on the shelves in Japan there's Wii U
3782000	3784000	now there's not a Wii there's 360
3784000	3786000	but in Japan that's not
3786000	3788000	a factor sorry and the PlayStation 3
3788000	3790000	you know so it's literally gonna be
3790000	3792000	do you want the new system or the old system
3792000	3794000	that's the way it is in Japan right now
3794000	3796000	it'll be interesting
3796000	3798000	so of course handhelds
3798000	3800000	it's a whole nother Oprah because they
3800000	3802000	are making a push with the Vita in Japan
3802000	3804000	big time we talked about that already last week
3804000	3806000	alright one more story and then we'll travel
3806000	3808000	around the world and check out release dates Stark Sakura
3808000	3810000	I was giving you back your
3810000	3812000	power supply rod thank you for bringing back what you
3812000	3814000	borrow yes because I'm always
3814000	3816000	good that way well here is
3816000	3818000	something that how long have you had some of my
3818000	3820000	games
3820000	3822000	what you mean
3822000	3824000	that I've actually played
3824000	3826000	I'm just gonna be
3826000	3828000	playing games okay
3828000	3830000	so well this should interest
3830000	3832000	you you like SimCity
3832000	3834000	don't you I like the old SimCity
3834000	3836000	I like the first SimCity game
3836000	3838000	I like SimCity action news on the
3838000	3840000	CD-ROM remember that do I have
3840000	3842000	to go get those YouTubes because I will
3842000	3844000	ah there's a big mine
3844000	3846000	no
3846000	3848000	they should make me a voice actor
3848000	3850000	well Maxis is
3850000	3852000	considering an offline mode for SimCity
3852000	3854000	the note
3854000	3856000	was put on the state of SimCity
3856000	3858000	blog where the Emeryville
3858000	3860000	manager Patrick Beutcher
3860000	3862000	I guess is saying
3862000	3864000	that they are considering
3864000	3866000	an offline mode apparently since a lot
3866000	3868000	of people yes
3868000	3870000	Alan I will check out your Saturn
3870000	3872000	um since
3872000	3874000	a lot of people have been complaining
3874000	3876000	that it is specifically on
3876000	3878000	the quote says right now we
3878000	3880000	have a team specifically focused on
3880000	3882000	exploring the possibility of an offline mode
3882000	3884000	I can't make any promises on when we
3884000	3886000	will have more information but we know this is
3886000	3888000	something that many of our players have been asking for
3888000	3890000	so
3890000	3892000	who knows maybe it'll be sooner rather than
3892000	3894000	later I'm interested
3894000	3896000	I don't have the game
3896000	3898000	yet but I'm interested in offline mode
3898000	3900000	here's my concern because
3900000	3902000	SimCity is starting to come down in price a little bit
3902000	3904000	I have a feeling that
3904000	3906000	they'll do it as part of an expansion
3906000	3908000	or something to get you to spend the full 60
3908000	3910000	bucks which
3910000	3912000	I mean whatever I would consider
3912000	3914000	still spending it on an offline SimCity
3914000	3916000	that doesn't require Origin
3916000	3918000	but we'll see
3918000	3920000	yeah
3920000	3922000	well I honestly
3922000	3924000	and just on the same note
3924000	3926000	I wish that there would be
3926000	3928000	updates across the board for all of them so you don't
3928000	3930000	have to use Origin but that's me
3930000	3932000	and everybody else that plays
3932000	3934000	Mass Effect 3
3934000	3936000	alright traveling around the world
3936000	3938000	and checking out some release dates things that
3938000	3940000	will be coming a little sooner than

3984000	3986000	on Saturday
3986000	3988000	just a small
3988000	3990000	portable game called Pokemon

3992000	3994000	might sell a couple copies

4000000	4002000	they have Skylanders Swap Force

4004000	4006000	you can take the top part of the character
4006000	4008000	and put it on the bottom part of another character
4008000	4010000	woooo
4010000	4012000	innovation
4012000	4014000	and jumping you can jump now
4014000	4016000	woooo
4016000	4018000	sell me a thousand copies already
4018000	4020000	it will sell
4020000	4022000	much more than a thousand copies
4022000	4024000	uh yes so
4024000	4026000	hey you know my 5 year old nephew is nuts
4026000	4028000	about that game so
4028000	4030000	5 year old nephew checked out Disney Infinity
4030000	4032000	as well? I have permanently
4032000	4034000	disbarred him from anything Disney related online
4034000	4036000	so no
4036000	4038000	wow this sounds like a story
4038000	4040000	I also want to mention
4040000	4042000	that also on Saturday
4042000	4044000	they coincide with the Pokemon
4044000	4046000	X and Y on the 3DS
4046000	4048000	you can buy a 2DS
4048000	4050000	one less
4050000	4052000	DS in there
4052000	4054000	if 3D is too much for you
4054000	4056000	if the 3D will blow your mind
4056000	4058000	the 2D will just kind of simmer your mind
4058000	4060000	I am hearing, take it with a grain of salt
4060000	4062000	but I am hearing that the 2DS
4062000	4064000	a lot of people kind of like the way it feels
4064000	4066000	when they play it for what it's worth
4066000	4068000	I mean despite the fact that
4068000	4070000	a lot of people have been very critical about the design
4070000	4072000	how it doesn't fold the same way and so forth
4072000	4074000	hearing a lot of positive feedback about
4074000	4076000	how it feels when it's in your hands
4076000	4078000	I'd like to mention though
4078000	4080000	even though I do happen to peruse
4080000	4082000	the Evil G website for some release dates
4082000	4084000	sometimes I am kind of
4084000	4086000	confused at why they're selling
4086000	4088000	GoPro accessories for
4088000	4090000	Gamestop
4090000	4092000	I don't know
4092000	4094000	I don't know
4094000	4096000	Moving on to Japan and checking out
4096000	4098000	the releases over there on the Playstation 3
4098000	4100000	on October 10th
4100000	4102000	the Batman Arkham Twin Pack which came out here
4102000	4104000	just last week I think
4104000	4106000	comes out in Japan
4106000	4108000	it's called the best series
4108000	4110000	also coming out in Japan on the 10th
4110000	4112000	F1 2013
4112000	4114000	Grand Theft Auto 5's Japanese release
4114000	4116000	Mina no Golf 6
4116000	4118000	gets a best release
4118000	4120000	a price reduction
4120000	4122000	Sakatsuku Pro Soccer Club
4122000	4124000	comes out from Sega
4124000	4126000	and Tales of Symphonia
4126000	4128000	the Unisonant pack comes out
4128000	4130000	there's like a regular
4130000	4132000	there's a Famitsu Deluxe pack
4132000	4134000	and there's a Lalabit Market
4134000	4136000	limited edition pack
4136000	4138000	so there's all that if you're Tales of Symphonia
4138000	4140000	looking forward to that
4140000	4142000	also worth mentioning a game called Fairy Fencer F
4142000	4144000	comes out from Compile
4144000	4146000	in a regular and limited edition
4146000	4148000	Fairy Fencer
4148000	4150000	is that like fencing?
4150000	4152000	you put them on a spike
4152000	4154000	and then you fence
4154000	4156000	each other with dead fairies
4156000	4158000	that would be awesome
4158000	4160000	they're not Navi fairies
4160000	4162000	they're like
4162000	4164000	they're like carrying
4164000	4166000	pole arms
4166000	4168000	she's fighting a grizzly bear
4168000	4170000	and yes of course she's wearing a short skirt
4170000	4172000	and you can pretty much
4172000	4174000	see her hoo-ha hanging out
4174000	4176000	by fairies do you mean Vocaloids?
4176000	4178000	because that's what they look more like
4178000	4180000	I think it might be I'm not sure
4180000	4182000	but Fairy Fencing
4182000	4184000	they're fencing your face off
4184000	4186000	basically if you're that grizzly bear
4186000	4188000	I'm a fenced
4188000	4190000	alright
4190000	4192000	let's see what's coming out on other systems in Japan
4192000	4194000	this week
4194000	4196000	moving on over to the Xbox 360
4196000	4198000	ha ha I know but there are still things
4198000	4200000	coming out including Grand Theft Auto 5
4200000	4202000	F1 2013
4202000	4204000	the Batman Arkham pack
4204000	4206000	and there's an Xbox Live 12 month
4206000	4208000	2 gold membership card that comes with
4208000	4210000	Grand Theft Auto 5
4210000	4212000	I don't really know what that means but that is something that is happening in Japan
4212000	4214000	they probably had something similar here
4214000	4216000	I just missed it
4216000	4218000	on the Playstation Vita this week Dream Club Zero Portable
4218000	4220000	gets a price reduction
4220000	4222000	a new game called Getsuigakuen
4222000	4224000	cool comes out this week
4224000	4226000	wait wait what?
4226000	4228000	Getsuigakuen Co
4228000	4230000	comes out this week
4230000	4232000	can I see what that looks like?
4232000	4234000	you sure can
4234000	4236000	this is the one screenshot I have
4236000	4238000	unless this other
4238000	4240000	let me check out this other page
4240000	4242000	might have more
4242000	4244000	fantastic radio here we have
4244000	4246000	that just shows what it comes with
4246000	4248000	I want to see what the limited edition comes with
4248000	4250000	I thought I've heard of it before
4250000	4252000	but I don't remember off hand
4252000	4254000	aha it looks like they get the game
4254000	4256000	a book, maybe a school book
4256000	4258000	a music CD
4258000	4260000	and trading cards?
4260000	4262000	that's a drama CD
4262000	4264000	no
4264000	4266000	the CD is
4266000	4268000	basically like a play
4268000	4270000	like radio drama
4270000	4272000	so maybe this is based off some type of
4272000	4274000	drama series
4274000	4276000	alright also on the Playstation Vita
4276000	4278000	Metal Gear Solid HD edition
4278000	4280000	getting a price reduction
4280000	4282000	and I think some new Vita
4282000	4284000	equipment comes out this week
4284000	4286000	is this the week of the Vita Slim model?
4286000	4288000	it is, so this is the week where
4288000	4290000	your black, khaki black, light blue white
4290000	4292000	lime green white, pink black
4292000	4294000	white and black slim models
4294000	4296000	all come out, so no wonder
4296000	4298000	there's so much on the Vita this week
4298000	4300000	oh my gosh there's Slaughter Mania 5
4300000	4302000	like slaughter, like slot machines
4302000	4304000	not like I'm gonna go kill a bunch of zombies
4304000	4306000	Slaughter Mania
4306000	4308000	Uncharted Golden Abyss gets a re-release
4308000	4310000	in the best hits
4310000	4312000	Soul Sacrifice gets a re-release
4312000	4314000	and then Sakatsuku Pro Soccer Club
4314000	4316000	Osukuru
4316000	4318000	comes out this week also
4318000	4320000	so lots of stuff going on on the Vita this week
4320000	4322000	now that makes sense
4322000	4324000	now that I see that the
4324000	4326000	Vita Slim is out this week
4326000	4328000	so I'm sure there will be some people here for that
4328000	4330000	on the Wii U, sadly nothing to report this week
4330000	4332000	but Rayman Legends coming up next week
4332000	4334000	you got a little time
4334000	4336000	and on the Nintendo 3DS this week
4336000	4338000	Pokemon X and Y is also
4338000	4340000	on Japan, it's like a worldwide release
4340000	4342000	also a big release for them
4342000	4344000	on the 12th and
4344000	4346000	there's all sorts of accessories
4346000	4348000	you can get
4348000	4350000	Froki pens
4350000	4352000	you can get
4352000	4354000	Chesapeake pouches
4354000	4356000	and
4356000	4358000	Lord knows what else, there you go
4358000	4360000	all that coming out in Japan
4360000	4362000	this week on the 3DS
4362000	4364000	Dark Sakura?
4364000	4366000	Well we have a pretty
4366000	4368000	slender selection for the UK
4368000	4370000	on the 9th there's Montague's Mount
4370000	4372000	for PC
4372000	4374000	and
4374000	4376000	on the 11th we have
4376000	4378000	Beyond 2 Souls for PS3
4378000	4380000	that's about it
4380000	4382000	alright just a couple more news stories for you guys
4382000	4384000	and then the classic game of the week
4384000	4386000	and it will surprise no one
4386000	4388000	Loki?
4388000	4390000	alright
4390000	4392000	so let's see here
4392000	4394000	SNK
4394000	4396000	they are getting rid of
4396000	4398000	the Neo Geo X, you may remember
4398000	4400000	the Neo Geo X is kind of that
4400000	4402000	rebuild I guess of the
4402000	4404000	classic Neo Geo
4404000	4406000	they also had this
4406000	4408000	portable system that was
4408000	4410000	plugged into this dock
4410000	4412000	it was kind of emulating everything
4412000	4414000	but
4414000	4416000	now they have cease and desist
4416000	4418000	against the website that sells the Neo Geo X
4420000	4422000	I guess they were saying
4422000	4424000	that the notice which
4424000	4426000	appeared on October 2nd
4426000	4428000	demands an immediate cease and desist
4428000	4430000	of manufacturing, distribution, promotion
4430000	4432000	and selling of the Neo Geo X
4432000	4434000	gold limited edition mega pack
4434000	4436000	volume 1 and classic volumes 1 through 5
4436000	4438000	as well as the Neo Geo X
4438000	4440000	arcade stick in order to
4440000	4442000	protect our intellectual property rights
4442000	4444000	such as Neo Geo and SNK
4444000	4446000	see here I thought
4446000	4448000	me being naive I guess that
4448000	4450000	they had the go ahead to go ahead and make that stuff
4450000	4452000	since they had SNK on it
4452000	4454000	and it was a fucking Neo Geo
4454000	4456000	I mean at least it looked like one
4456000	4458000	come to find out they didn't
4458000	4460000	they just kind of put it out there anyways
4460000	4462000	wow, it's been out for a while too
4462000	4464000	I was going to say I forgot the thing even came out
4464000	4466000	how horrible is that
4466000	4468000	but I mean they've recycled those Neo Geo games
4468000	4470000	like a ton of them are available on
4470000	4472000	Virtual Console and Playstation 3
4472000	4474000	download I mean
4474000	4476000	if you want something a little more authentic
4476000	4478000	I guess you could get this but
4478000	4480000	keep in mind those licensed ones
4480000	4482000	SNK gets money for
4482000	4484000	true, they would get no money
4484000	4486000	if they didn't
4486000	4488000	provide their license
4488000	4490000	ok, here's what it is, I get it now
4490000	4492000	I guess it was licensed
4492000	4494000	because Tomo was the one that was putting it out
4494000	4496000	they do a lot of license, weird shit
4496000	4498000	but now they're ending
4498000	4500000	their license agreement so
4500000	4502000	it's no longer going to be sold after the 2nd
4502000	4504000	wow, the 2nd of October?
4504000	4506000	well then it's done
4506000	4508000	it's done, yes, so
4508000	4510000	kind of makes me wonder
4510000	4512000	it sounds very like
4512000	4514000	not like we've decided
4514000	4516000	to, you know, end our
4516000	4518000	licensing agreement with Tomo, we're just not going to
4518000	4520000	produce anymore, it's like please be informed that
4520000	4522000	our company is
4522000	4524000	or the licensing agreement is
4524000	4526000	terminated as of October 2nd
4526000	4528000	so what happens to all these unsold consoles
4528000	4530000	they go in a landfill in New Mexico?
4530000	4532000	no, they still get sold, they just can't produce anymore
4532000	4534000	oh, well that's good
4534000	4536000	go get them now
4536000	4538000	if they're sitting on some then yeah
4538000	4540000	I don't think they can sell them
4540000	4542000	they don't have an agreement to do so anymore
4542000	4544000	if there's some out there in a while
4544000	4546000	there's something they can do about that
4546000	4548000	this will be a collector's item very soon
4548000	4550000	no company for ET down there
4550000	4552000	I'll still
4552000	4554000	stick with my Neo Geo
4554000	4556000	you got the real thing though, why even bother
4556000	4558000	with this stuff if you have the real thing
4558000	4560000	because it has the games loaded on the system
4560000	4562000	you know how much I paid for the last cartridge
4562000	4564000	I bought?
4564000	4566000	we paid $300 for
4566000	4568000	what was the last one we got?
4568000	4570000	King of Fighters 2000
4570000	4572000	when I had money
4572000	4574000	blows me away how much those cartridges cost
4574000	4576000	the 48 in 1's
4576000	4578000	there's a ton of them on one cartridge
4578000	4580000	Bobby knows
4580000	4582000	alright
4582000	4584000	one more story about Terraria
4584000	4586000	which is a hardcore fan
4586000	4588000	I saw Terraria on
4588000	4590000	Playstation 3 this weekend
4590000	4592000	I was at Fry's randomly when I got the
4592000	4594000	capture box
4594000	4596000	and I didn't realize because it comes with
4596000	4598000	all that extra stuff, it has a neat little box
4598000	4600000	that it comes in with the drive and everything
4600000	4602000	so I was kind of looking at that going
4602000	4604000	oh neat
4604000	4606000	I personally way preferred Minecraft
4606000	4608000	to Terraria but I know Terraria
4608000	4610000	definitely has its fans, people love the
4610000	4612000	retroness and the 2D that Terraria has
4612000	4614000	and so the good news is Terraria 2
4614000	4616000	it's a thing that's happening
4616000	4618000	Andrew Spinks the creator of Terraria
4618000	4620000	talked about Terraria 2
4620000	4622000	saying it is definitely something
4622000	4624000	that will be happening but contrary
4624000	4626000	to several of the articles that went live today
4626000	4628000	I have not started development
4628000	4630000	I have a list of features and mechanics
4630000	4632000	I want the game to have but that is the
4632000	4634000	extent of the development at this point
4634000	4636000	so in other words, he's going to do it
4636000	4638000	it's announced in that regard
4638000	4640000	but that's it, we don't have anything else
4640000	4642000	so don't plan on this happening anytime
4642000	4644000	soon
4644000	4646000	let's see, also in the interview
4646000	4648000	mentioned that version 1.2
4648000	4650000	will be the last
4650000	4652000	7 month update for the original game
4652000	4654000	but that he will change the end game
4654000	4656000	up for the update within the next month
4656000	4658000	or two because there was no final
4658000	4660000	boss and there may be some other
4660000	4662000	smaller updates a few more months down the line
4662000	4664000	he might hire a team to
4664000	4666000	do some updates but he'll be
4666000	4668000	focusing on Terraria 2 soon
4668000	4670000	so there you go
4670000	4672000	Darkstalker, you played a little bit of Terraria right?
4672000	4674000	Yeah, you gave me a copy
4674000	4676000	Yeah, I remember that, I bought like a 4 pack
4676000	4678000	It was interesting
4678000	4680000	I don't think I could quite get into it very well
4680000	4682000	but it was interesting, it amused
4682000	4684000	It amused me for an hour
4684000	4686000	Thank you for amusing me for an hour, Rob
4686000	4688000	You're welcome
4688000	4690000	Alright, well let's talk about a game that has amused Darkstalker
4690000	4692000	for a hell of a lot longer than an hour
4692000	4694000	and it amused her earlier today
4694000	4696000	when she picked it
4696000	4698000	as the classic game of the week
4698000	4700000	because every week Darkstalker dives into the gaming vault
4700000	4702000	and pulls out a game 10 years or older
4702000	4704000	and says
4704000	4706000	Hey!
4706000	4708000	Respect this game and play it now
4708000	4710000	Dust it off
4710000	4712000	Darkstalker, you better play bitch
4712000	4714000	You better play
4714000	4716000	Darkstalker
4716000	4718000	What is the classic game of the week?
4718000	4720000	The game is
4720000	4722000	Animal Crossing
4722000	4724000	AKA Dobutsu no Mori
4724000	4726000	Animal Forest
4726000	4728000	It is a life sim game
4728000	4730000	and I miss this music, Rob
4730000	4732000	The old school music
4732000	4734000	Wasn't it good?
4734000	4736000	It was good
4740000	4742000	I was actually running around the house
4742000	4744000	making up lyrics to this to Midna
4744000	4746000	because she was looking at me like I was insane
4746000	4748000	She probably does that a lot, I bet
4748000	4750000	Shut up
4750000	4752000	So anyway
4752000	4754000	and of course the one that I linked on here
4754000	4756000	is actually the Nintendo 64 one
4756000	4758000	which was the very first Dobutsu no Mori
4760000	4762000	It came out in Japan on April 14, 2001
4762000	4764000	and came out on the GameCube as
4764000	4766000	Animal Forest Plus
4766000	4768000	in
4768000	4770000	the next December
4770000	4772000	so that was in 2002
4772000	4774000	and then came out in other countries
4774000	4776000	as Animal Crossing
4776000	4778000	and like I had mentioned earlier
4778000	4780000	in the show, because we got
4780000	4782000	so much more stuff over here
4782000	4784000	they released a new version that was called
4784000	4786000	Animal Forest E Plus
4786000	4788000	which actually has characters in that one
4788000	4790000	that are in no other versions
4790000	4792000	of the game
4792000	4794000	If you want to read more about them, look on the wiki
4794000	4796000	There's a really, really good
4796000	4798000	Animal Crossing wiki
4798000	4800000	So the game itself
4800000	4802000	is
4802000	4804000	No, Bobby, I'm not doing Halo
4804000	4806000	So the game itself
4806000	4808000	has evolved over time
4808000	4810000	but I'm going to focus on the
4810000	4812000	GameCube one since that is
4812000	4814000	probably the one
4814000	4816000	the majority of us have started with
4816000	4818000	So with the very first
4818000	4820000	game, and it was
4820000	4822000	like this on the Nintendo 64 as well
4822000	4824000	you would
4824000	4826000	arrive in town
4826000	4828000	homeless
4828000	4830000	penniless and get forced into
4830000	4832000	indentured servitude by the
4832000	4834000	evil Tom Nook
4834000	4836000	who is the mobster
4836000	4838000	boss of your town
4838000	4840000	it's in all
4840000	4842000	reality, you know, it's a very
4842000	4844000	open-ended game, it keeps going, you have
4844000	4846000	different holidays in town
4846000	4848000	you have to, you know, earn money
4848000	4850000	and pay off your mortgage
4850000	4852000	and you can expand your house
4852000	4854000	people were there
4854000	4856000	to collect NES games
4856000	4858000	that's what they were there for
4858000	4860000	sorry, I can't contain myself
4860000	4862000	so anyway
4862000	4864000	you have to
4864000	4866000	you know
4866000	4868000	you earn Bells, which is the in-game currency
4868000	4870000	you pay off your loan
4870000	4872000	and in the
4872000	4874000	and you hit villagers with bug nets
4874000	4876000	you know, I keep hitting that fucker Ed
4876000	4878000	with a bug net and he won't move
4878000	4880000	I'm not the only one having to
4880000	4882000	deal with Ed by the way
4882000	4884000	so, he's a dumb horse
4884000	4886000	so anyway, you also could
4886000	4888000	collect Nintendo
4888000	4890000	Entertainment games
4890000	4892000	and as far as I'm aware
4892000	4894000	I think this just popped up
4894000	4896000	in
4896000	4898000	I want to say just in the
4900000	4902000	GameCube ones
4902000	4904000	you basically
4904000	4906000	you could get, you know, Ice Climber
4906000	4908000	and Mario Brothers
4908000	4910000	those were available via
4910000	4912000	eReader
4912000	4914000	there were all kinds of
4914000	4916000	they also said that The Legend of Zelda
4916000	4918000	was in the game, but they had no means
4918000	4920000	of obtaining it
4920000	4922000	I think it was supposed to be like a prize or something
4922000	4924000	so yeah
4924000	4926000	there were different multiplayer modes as well
4926000	4928000	where you could
4928000	4930000	have up to four people living
4930000	4932000	in the village
4932000	4934000	you couldn't play at the
4934000	4936000	same time as anybody else, but you could take turns
4936000	4938000	like, Dan and I would see
4938000	4940000	who could pay off our mortgage faster
4940000	4942000	and who got the gold statue and who got the silver statue
4942000	4944000	and finally I'm like, bitch make your own town
4944000	4946000	so he has Danville
4946000	4948000	that was his town
4948000	4950000	you also
4950000	4952000	can
4952000	4954000	ship items from one to another
4954000	4956000	via codes
4956000	4958000	and you can say, hey
4958000	4960000	milk you asshole, send this to Rob
4960000	4962000	and Fetch, which is your town now
4962000	4964000	isn't it? What was your old town?
4964000	4966000	Rob is...
4966000	4968000	sorry I was eating
4968000	4970000	my old town was
4970000	4972000	I think it was like Robville or something silly
4972000	4974000	yeah, well Dan had Danville because Danville
4974000	4976000	exists
4976000	4978000	you could also leave messages to each other
4978000	4980000	on the big board
4980000	4982000	that's in the center of town
4982000	4984000	and I still do that when I visit people's
4984000	4986000	towns as I'll say, hey Jamie was here
4986000	4988000	so and so sucks
4988000	4990000	steal Ed from me, still trying to steal Kabuki from you
4990000	4992000	now this I wanted to play a little bit
4998000	5000000	do you hear how the voice sounds?
5000000	5002000	now
5002000	5004000	in the Japanese version
5004000	5006000	basically they are
5006000	5008000	they say every syllable
5008000	5010000	every kana
5010000	5012000	so you can actually, I mean it's really
5012000	5014000	sped up and fast, but you can actually kind of
5014000	5016000	pick out what they're saying
5016000	5018000	for the American, for the English versions
5018000	5020000	basically they say each letter
5020000	5022000	so it really does sound like a bunch of gibberish
5024000	5026000	and the voices of course
5026000	5028000	went a little bit differently because they had to
5028000	5030000	redo them to say each of the letters
5030000	5032000	you had another thing
5032000	5034000	that was only in the earlier ones
5034000	5036000	and that was
5036000	5038000	Mr. Resetti or as he was
5038000	5040000	called in Japan, I think he was Resetsan
5040000	5042000	so
5042000	5044000	if you turned off your game without saving
5044000	5046000	the next time you turned it on, he'd pop out of the ground
5046000	5048000	and berate you for like an hour
5048000	5050000	so basically he annoyed you into not doing it again
5050000	5052000	you um
5052000	5054000	now the part that's showing on the video right now
5054000	5056000	if you can kind of hear some of it
5056000	5058000	is where you talk to Rover
5058000	5060000	who basically he asks you questions
5060000	5062000	and depending on how you answer it determines what your looks are
5062000	5064000	so
5064000	5066000	I always cheat and use an FAQ
5066000	5068000	so that my character will look how I want her to look
5068000	5070000	um
5070000	5072000	now with the GameCube one you could also use
5072000	5074000	the Game Boy Advance to do stuff on the island
5074000	5076000	you were able to
5076000	5078000	um
5078000	5080000	uh
5080000	5082000	basically get fruits from villagers
5082000	5084000	you get bells, you would be able to
5084000	5086000	use the islanders tools
5086000	5088000	and bury things
5088000	5090000	and pick them up later
5090000	5092000	you also were able to um
5092000	5094000	use uh
5094000	5096000	the pattern design tool for the Able Sisters
5096000	5098000	on your Game Boy Advance
5098000	5100000	so you were able to use that to create
5100000	5102000	different things
5102000	5104000	another thing that you know
5104000	5106000	is still one of my favorite parts of the game
5106000	5108000	um is that uh
5108000	5110000	you had a character who
5110000	5112000	in the Japanese version his name was Toda Keke
5112000	5114000	who if I remember right
5114000	5116000	he was named after
5116000	5118000	a music composer
5118000	5120000	um over here he's Keke Spider
5120000	5122000	and he would
5122000	5124000	he would sing different uh
5124000	5126000	songs in the old ones he would
5126000	5128000	sing in I believe it was the town square
5128000	5130000	um in later versions
5130000	5132000	he would also sing at the Roost Cafe
5132000	5134000	now he actually has Club Lowell
5134000	5136000	where he sings on Saturday nights
5136000	5138000	and you listen to the song and you can
5138000	5140000	get a demo version and now the stores
5140000	5142000	actually sell his music
5142000	5144000	you can also use um the music
5144000	5146000	as the album art
5146000	5148000	on your wall as a poster
5148000	5150000	but going back to the um
5150000	5152000	okay here it is it was actually um
5152000	5154000	Totaka Kazumi
5154000	5156000	um so that's where Toda Keke's name came from
5156000	5158000	so uh
5158000	5160000	at any rate the game had
5160000	5162000	absolutely
5162000	5164000	adorable music just really neat songs
5164000	5166000	you had all kinds of genre
5166000	5168000	represented in Toda Keke's music
5168000	5170000	um
5170000	5172000	and then um just the background music
5172000	5174000	was really iconic I mean
5174000	5176000	to this day I still like I was
5176000	5178000	saying I've gone around singing the stupid
5178000	5180000	theme song to my cat
5180000	5182000	you know I'd like to play
5182000	5184000	the game at certain times of the day because
5184000	5186000	certain music will play I really
5186000	5188000	love the midnight music I love to play
5188000	5190000	at midnight just because of the music
5190000	5192000	now the other thing that you had going on in this game was
5192000	5194000	your collection
5194000	5196000	you could collect um
5196000	5198000	uh well I'm not gonna
5198000	5200000	say these are officially a collectible item
5200000	5202000	but you get the um haniwa
5202000	5204000	which uh we got as gyroids
5204000	5206000	which after it rained you could dig them up
5206000	5208000	in the ground because back in the old school
5208000	5210000	days haniwa were buried with the dead
5210000	5212000	so that's why you dig them
5212000	5214000	up out of the ground
5214000	5216000	um and
5216000	5218000	Alpha Kinanagram also wants to point out that
5218000	5220000	Totaka has um
5220000	5222000	his uh song which actually
5222000	5224000	is in the game
5224000	5226000	as Keke's song
5226000	5228000	the little hidden thing that was also in Mario
5228000	5230000	Paint and all the different
5230000	5232000	you know things that he ever did sound designed
5232000	5234000	for so
5234000	5236000	um
5236000	5238000	at any rate um you could
5238000	5240000	collect fish and there are certain fish
5240000	5242000	that show up at different times of the year you have different
5242000	5244000	bugs that show up at a different time of the year
5244000	5246000	you also could collect um works of art
5246000	5248000	different paintings and like
5248000	5250000	and you also had different special
5250000	5252000	characters that would pop up I already mentioned
5252000	5254000	Mr. Resetti you had the able sisters
5254000	5256000	who made the clothes you had
5256000	5258000	Tom Nook who was the
5258000	5260000	evil mafia boss of the town
5260000	5262000	um also there uh
5262000	5264000	he was the one percent of
5264000	5266000	my village you had
5266000	5268000	uh
5268000	5270000	the police dogs copper
5270000	5272000	and what was the other one's name
5272000	5274000	I can't remember the other one's name
5274000	5276000	um there were
5276000	5278000	uh
5278000	5280000	now we have Isabelle and Digby
5280000	5282000	in the newer ones uh
5282000	5284000	Isabelle is your uh apparently she never
5284000	5286000	sleeps cause she is at the stupid
5286000	5288000	uh town hall all
5288000	5290000	the damn time you could change
5290000	5292000	your town theme you could change catch
5292000	5294000	phrases like we used to make people say some
5294000	5296000	really dirty ass things and Nintendo finally got
5296000	5298000	smart and yeah
5298000	5300000	might have been an offender with that
5300000	5302000	well I've got um
5302000	5304000	Rowan going around wearing the Link
5304000	5306000	outfit saying kitty fuck
5306000	5308000	hahaha
5308000	5310000	um you know
5310000	5312000	we used to have Dina remember Dina
5312000	5314000	and she apparently
5314000	5316000	um is no longer
5316000	5318000	a gym teacher but a music
5318000	5320000	teacher she's a folk singer
5320000	5322000	Rob staying with her ways
5322000	5324000	nice um
5324000	5326000	but you know all of your different villagers you've got
5326000	5328000	different um types of personalities
5328000	5330000	they actually brought back the
5330000	5332000	uh sort of big sister personality
5332000	5334000	the perky and the
5334000	5336000	uh sort of friendly older brother personality
5336000	5338000	that were in earlier games
5338000	5340000	um and different characters that go back and forth
5340000	5342000	now the other thing with this is it is
5342000	5344000	and I've mentioned this before
5344000	5346000	Bobby, Bobby said he made
5346000	5348000	all this town people say just ignore him
5348000	5350000	Halo classic game of the year it's not gonna happen
5350000	5352000	he's trolling you and it's working I know but I'm just
5352000	5354000	laughing at him because he's still trying
5354000	5356000	and it's just not funny
5356000	5358000	um
5358000	5360000	I've made
5360000	5362000	Ed say I totally suck is his
5362000	5364000	greeting and then his catch phrase is
5364000	5366000	I really suck
5366000	5368000	I fucking hate Ed
5368000	5370000	um now in the newer ones you've got
5370000	5372000	like you can have a campsite where people can
5372000	5374000	visit and they'll play stupid games and
5374000	5376000	steal your money fuckers
5376000	5378000	I mean just all kinds of stuff to do
5378000	5380000	and there's the island you know I mentioned the island
5380000	5382000	and
5382000	5384000	I can't help it I had
5384000	5386000	I've had so much fun with
5386000	5388000	the first game now to bring up
5388000	5390000	um what I was talking about about
5390000	5392000	the dialogue about it you know since
5392000	5394000	Japanese is basically a syllabic
5394000	5396000	uh alphabet
5396000	5398000	I picked up the GameCube
5398000	5400000	one in Japanese to practice my reading
5400000	5402000	and lo and behold my
5402000	5404000	reading actually improved I mean I'm way
5404000	5406000	out of practice now but it was a
5406000	5408000	very very good educational tool so
5408000	5410000	I'm actually offering this out here
5410000	5412000	to anyone who happens to be
5412000	5414000	a beginner learner who's
5414000	5416000	wanting to practice your reading to
5416000	5418000	understand grammar and syntax
5418000	5420000	basically get Animal Crossing on GameCube
5420000	5422000	I mean use it to import
5422000	5424000	other copies it will really
5424000	5426000	really really help your reading comprehension
5426000	5428000	in Japanese and it's not kanji
5428000	5430000	heavy so
5430000	5432000	you don't have to really worry about it
5432000	5434000	um so anyway
5434000	5436000	there's so much to do
5436000	5438000	the original was fun
5438000	5440000	the newer ones are fun I mean they kind of got
5440000	5442000	stale with City Folk
5442000	5444000	and Wild World but I think
5444000	5446000	that um the last one
5446000	5448000	that um New Leaf
5448000	5450000	really has brought back a lot
5450000	5452000	of the fun that was in the game I mean of course you
5452000	5454000	don't have the uh NES games heading around
5454000	5456000	but it's still super fun I mean
5456000	5458000	I think
5458000	5460000	anybody can appreciate it I still say though and I said this on
5460000	5462000	a previous show but I wish they'd just develop a
5462000	5464000	handful not a lot but a handful of very
5464000	5466000	simple like flash style games
5466000	5468000	that you could unlock that would be a lot of fun
5468000	5470000	or maybe old Game & Watch
5470000	5472000	oh yeah that would be cool
5472000	5474000	things that they don't sell at all in Virtual Console
5474000	5476000	until then I will have to make myself
5476000	5478000	happy by being very very
5478000	5480000	this is the other thing I was going to mention
5480000	5482000	is that there was a full length movie
5482000	5484000	um based off it and it actually had
5484000	5486000	as your animal characters it had
5486000	5488000	they were all characters in the game
5488000	5490000	and one of them lives in my village now
5490000	5492000	in the US she's Margie
5492000	5494000	in uh in Japan she's Sally
5494000	5496000	the elephant who's like one of the main main characters
5496000	5498000	lives in my village and I found out
5498000	5500000	that Act Duff has a bouquet
5500000	5502000	or Rosie in the US one
5502000	5504000	so I was sort of like oh that's
5504000	5506000	cool sort of like a way to be
5506000	5508000	involved so anyway
5508000	5510000	um Animal Crossing
5510000	5512000	lots of fun alright there it is
5512000	5514000	your classic game of the week
5514000	5516000	Animal Forest
5516000	5518000	or Animal Crossing is the case
5518000	5520000	maybe uh very awesome
5520000	5522000	game I do love that game
5522000	5524000	uh yep and I love the 3DS one too
5524000	5526000	so um even though I do miss the NES
5526000	5528000	games but uh a good pick
5528000	5530000	another great pick while we're going down
5530000	5532000	these games that are 10 plus years
5532000	5534000	old yet I remember them like they were
5534000	5536000	yesterday anyway
5536000	5538000	you know if Bobby keeps trolling me about Halo it's never
5538000	5540000	happening oh threatening
5540000	5542000	now alright not threatening that's a promise
5542000	5544000	alright
5544000	5546000	uh we're going to take a quick break guys
5546000	5548000	when we come back there is plenty more orange

5554000	5556000	about this release for Steam she will
5556000	5558000	probably buy this yet again on Steam
5558000	5560000	it's got to be that good we'll talk

5588000	5590000	chat room we were playing a kind of a variety
5590000	5592000	of music during the break there some
5592000	5594000	uh mostly like Super Nintendo classics
5594000	5596000	in there uh although we did have Animal
5596000	5598000	Crossing music starting it off we did have uh
5598000	5600000	I played something from Chrono Trigger
5600000	5602000	but then I played a Super Metroid song right after it
5602000	5604000	to try and troll Bobby back a little bit for you
5604000	5606000	Dark Sakura but then I followed it with a game
5606000	5608000	we can all agree is amazing A Link to the Past
5608000	5610000	so just a variety of music and uh
5610000	5612000	I like how our chatters who are
5612000	5614000	with us live on Saturday night will try to shout
5614000	5616000	out like what song is that or try to guess the music
5616000	5618000	while we're playing it so uh always a fun
5618000	5620000	time here live but we try to make it fun for the podcast
5620000	5622000	listeners too I was happy you played Animal
5622000	5624000	Crossing for me well you're welcome
5624000	5626000	cause it makes me happy I miss the first
5626000	5628000	game song sooo
5628000	5630000	much
5630000	5632000	I have a really good story about Animal Crossing
5632000	5634000	and that would be the way like I actually got
5634000	5636000	Animal Crossing um actually
5636000	5638000	Loki actually bought Animal Crossing for
5638000	5640000	me um years ago we used to
5640000	5642000	all put well you know we were all playing DDR we all
5642000	5644000	used to post on these local forums for
5644000	5646000	uh Sacramento DDR players and
5646000	5648000	I remember we were all pretty close I mean there was only about
5648000	5650000	like maybe 20 of us that actually ever posted on these boards
5650000	5652000	regularly but we were all a pretty close group
5652000	5654000	you know this was before Facebook and any of
5654000	5656000	that shit maybe about the time Live Journal was starting
5656000	5658000	to boom and uh Loki was
5658000	5660000	like you know um
5660000	5662000	what would you do if you just got a big bonus at work
5662000	5664000	what would you spend the money on I said I'd get a
5664000	5666000	GameCube and Animal Crossing and I come home from work
5666000	5668000	and what did Loki do he bought me a GameCube and Animal
5668000	5670000	Crossing it was one of the nicest things
5670000	5672000	it was one of the nicest things anyone's ever done for me so
5672000	5674000	now we're all poor as much of an asshole
5674000	5676000	as you are on this show sometimes Loki
5678000	5680000	deep down in he's a really nice guy so
5680000	5682000	there you go I told a nice story
5682000	5684000	about Loki on this show but no I
5684000	5686000	really appreciated that to this day that was like one of
5686000	5688000	a really awesome thing so
5688000	5690000	uh so hearing the music I
5690000	5692000	came home and that was on loop because I guess they
5692000	5694000	left it powered on I don't even know how you got into the house
5694000	5696000	you must have contacted my roommate at the time or something
5696000	5698000	yeah and uh set that all
5698000	5700000	up so that when I got home from work it was already on the
5700000	5702000	TV it was really cool so
5702000	5704000	alright well let's get back into some

5826000	5828000	I forgot they had the PayPal
5828000	5830000	and that the $150,000 in the
5830000	5832000	PayPal was going into the funds too
5832000	5834000	I forgot about that they still made
5834000	5836000	like other kickstarters they still may take money
5836000	5838000	via PayPal after
5838000	5840000	you know everything's said and done
5840000	5842000	it's fine I'll just wait
5842000	5844000	and buy it yeah it's spring 2015
5844000	5846000	fuck why am I buying stuff that comes out in 2015
5846000	5848000	exactly I need the money
5848000	5850000	now yeah I'm not buying stuff that comes out in
5850000	5852000	2014 yet let alone but thanks
5852000	5854000	to everybody who funded it for me so I can buy it
5854000	5856000	later
5856000	5858000	all right and uh
5858000	5860000	I know this game was crack for us
5860000	5862000	a little bit ago
5862000	5864000	seems like a little bit ago probably a couple years ago
5864000	5866000	tiny tower
5866000	5868000	is back and now tiny tower
5868000	5870000	has a new licensed product
5870000	5872000	Star Wars tiny
5872000	5874000	death star
5874000	5876000	coming to a mobile platform near you
5876000	5878000	that sounds kind of awesome I've got to say
5878000	5880000	are you going to build a tiny death star dark
5880000	5882000	sakura maybe
5882000	5884000	she's already building one in her house no
5884000	5886000	because I have
5886000	5888000	I have a
5888000	5890000	I have a village to run I'm the mayor
5890000	5892000	I'm empress sakura of normandy and I don't have time
5892000	5894000	for a death star
5894000	5896000	this makes me think of when they did that whole like
5896000	5898000	what's that website where you can do the white house
5898000	5900000	petitions or whatever and somebody
5900000	5902000	actually asks whitehouse.org
5902000	5904000	maybe or .gov
5904000	5906000	I thought they had like a spinoff site or something where you can do the
5906000	5908000	petitions specifically
5908000	5910000	oh I thought it was like a separate website
5910000	5912000	I don't know if I'm looking forward to
5912000	5914000	the inevitable
5914000	5916000	version you know kill ball heights
5916000	5918000	you know where they
5918000	5920000	have where you know
5920000	5922000	design your own
5922000	5924000	yeah
5924000	5926000	and then finally
5926000	5928000	you know because there's a lot of movie
5928000	5930000	or games
5930000	5932000	based on movies coming out but we have another
5932000	5934000	date for one warcraft
5934000	5936000	the movie coming to theaters
5936000	5938000	December 18th 2015
5938000	5940000	and
5940000	5942000	yeah
5942000	5944000	hell I know need for speeds coming
5944000	5946000	out next spring
5946000	5948000	I kind of want to see it just because it looks like
5948000	5950000	a generic racing action movie
5950000	5952000	we still don't know who's
5952000	5954000	in the cast for the warcraft movie though just a date
5954000	5956000	and I'm thinking like
5956000	5958000	ok that's a placeholder date that's one of those
5958000	5960000	hollywood games of chess
5960000	5962000	where they start to block out what movies
5962000	5964000	are coming out when and get away from my movie
5964000	5966000	and all that and you know
5966000	5968000	so don't hold fast that this
5968000	5970000	will actually go through
5970000	5972000	because it might get delayed to 2016
5972000	5974000	it might come out earlier sometimes movies come out
5974000	5976000	earlier although I doubt that because I haven't even started filming
5976000	5978000	yet so
5978000	5980000	yeah I mean I don't know
5980000	5982000	I guess it starts filming next year
5982000	5984000	in January but
5984000	5986000	I'm not really excited
5986000	5988000	for it because I don't know any of the
5988000	5990000	lore so it's just like hey
5990000	5992000	Lord of the Rings again or something
5992000	5994000	if the movie is going to be successful it's got to be accessible
5994000	5996000	to non warcraft players
5996000	5998000	it has to be all about thrall
5998000	6000000	I don't care I want thrall the movie
6000000	6002000	I think they're taking it way back well it was supposed to be alliance centered
6002000	6004000	but that was an early rumor
6004000	6006000	but Varian's a dick and no one cares
6006000	6008000	I think it's going back I don't think the game
6008000	6010000	is going to be based off of World of Warcraft
6010000	6012000	or the movie is going to be based off of
6012000	6014000	World of Warcraft I think the movie is going to be based off of
6014000	6016000	Warcraft or like Warcraft 3
6016000	6018000	maybe well that's cool
6018000	6020000	because then you get
6020000	6022000	a what's your face who I think is awesome
6022000	6024000	Sylvanas that'd be cool
6024000	6026000	now Tigerclaw
6026000	6028000	points out that the Warcraft movie is going to
6028000	6030000	December 2015 because 2015 is
6030000	6032000	overcrowded with some huge blockbuster
6032000	6034000	movies during the summer already
6034000	6036000	yeah isn't that when the
6036000	6038000	Age of Ultros comes out is 2015
6038000	6040000	as well right Avengers 2
6040000	6042000	and then what else is in the summer
6042000	6044000	2015 is that when Independence Day 2 is
6044000	6046000	finally happening oh my god I'm so
6046000	6048000	excited I only care about
6048000	6050000	it see like it starts you know
6050000	6052000	just like you know last Independence Day I saw it
6052000	6054000	was a third fourth and fifth I
6054000	6056000	kind of want to do that again I hope it's terrible
6056000	6058000	I hope it's absolutely I hope it is absolutely
6058000	6060000	god awful and I will be there every day I hope
6060000	6062000	Elizabeth Berkley is on the cast because that would be
6062000	6064000	awesome but it still has to have Jeff
6064000	6066000	Goldblum it is supposedly having
6066000	6068000	Jeff Goldblum the only one that's not coming back is Will Smith
6068000	6070000	but it'll be like Will Smith's kid
6070000	6072000	because he's like I'm a real actor now bye
6072000	6074000	Will Smith's kid well it's not even Will Smith's kid
6074000	6076000	it's just going to be some other like
6076000	6078000	other dude that's going to be like some
6078000	6080000	some other black pilot you know that's
6080000	6082000	going to be in the role who cares
6082000	6084000	you know what it doesn't matter it's not all about
6084000	6086000	Will Smith you know what they need uh
6086000	6088000	Randy Quaid ghost only way
6088000	6090000	they can make this movie Randy Quaid ghost
6090000	6092000	slash zombie the chat room
6092000	6094000	is making fun of me because apparently I had
6094000	6096000	a Freudian slip and I said age of
6096000	6098000	Ultros instead of Ultron
6098000	6100000	you know you've been playing too much
6100000	6102000	Final Fantasy when dot dot
6102000	6104000	dot wow
6104000	6106000	it would make for a more interesting movie
6106000	6108000	to be honest yeah it's true
6108000	6110000	honestly let's be real it would be a better
6110000	6112000	movie okay I'm I'm
6112000	6114000	I'm pissed because no actually
6114000	6116000	in the Marvel comics right now they're
6116000	6118000	they're pushing an age of Ultron right now
6118000	6120000	and I think that's the only reason why the next
6120000	6122000	movie is going to be Ultron
6122000	6124000	because it was fully set up for
6124000	6126000	Thanos hello yeah I know right
6126000	6128000	they just want to make you wait till three
6128000	6130000	I just I just thought of a tagline since
6130000	6132000	we're bringing Elizabeth Berkeley
6132000	6134000	into the cast as she should be uh
6134000	6136000	independence Independence Day
6136000	6138000	everybody got independence and shit
6138000	6140000	that
6140000	6142000	that is so obscure
6142000	6144000	there's like maybe five percent of the
6144000	6146000	audience if that is going to get that reference
6146000	6148000	but I love you just a little bit
6148000	6150000	more for making it Rob what
6150000	6152000	darling you are independent
6154000	6156000	I don't know what you're doing
6156000	6158000	in that jet but it sure as hell
6158000	6160000	ain't fighting any
6160000	6162000	no
6162000	6164000	one understands no
6164000	6166000	one I think the people who do understand
6166000	6168000	will make up for the ones that don't other movies
6168000	6170000	coming out in 2015 star wars
6170000	6172000	uh star wars episode seven
6172000	6174000	star star what
6174000	6176000	yeah
6176000	6178000	some flop movie in space
6178000	6180000	no I'm kidding actually if the rumors are true that Daniel
6180000	6182000	Day-Lewis is going to be in it
6182000	6184000	like that guy can like he could
6184000	6186000	act the phone book and it would be amazing
6186000	6188000	did you see the mock-up poster that some
6188000	6190000	I think it was like a photoshopping job but it was
6190000	6192000	sure it was really cool yeah that
6192000	6194000	had like the original actors and everything
6194000	6196000	you know looking their age and all that
6196000	6198000	as the characters would have been later on
6198000	6200000	that's pretty cool oh I do want drunk
6200000	6202000	Carrie Fisher in the movie so that would be
6202000	6204000	awesome
6204000	6206000	uh yeah oh man
6206000	6208000	alright and also in 2015 sorry I know this is
6208000	6210000	rapid fire news I'm using my quoting fingers
6210000	6212000	also in 2015 let's not forget
6212000	6214000	Batfleck is in 2015
6214000	6216000	and
6216000	6218000	you know what here's the thing though
6218000	6220000	here's the thing I
6220000	6222000	love Batman
6222000	6224000	stuff and
6224000	6226000	my favorite Batman honestly
6226000	6228000	is the Adam West era Batman
6228000	6230000	um
6230000	6232000	can it really get any cheesier than that
6232000	6234000	I don't know yeah but did you see
6234000	6236000	Daredevil well that was bad
6236000	6238000	can it really be worse than Batman and Robin
6238000	6240000	can it really get any worse
6240000	6242000	that's a good good question cause
6242000	6244000	that movie was bad you know the only reason
6244000	6246000	I saw it was because someone else paid for
6246000	6248000	it and drugged me along to see it
6248000	6250000	must be nice cause I wasn't gonna
6250000	6252000	spend any money on that and that's still two hours of my life
6252000	6254000	I can't get back I wanted to see it because
6254000	6256000	there is no such way there is no
6256000	6258000	way that Arnold
6258000	6260000	Schwarzenegger as Mr. Freeze is not gonna be
6260000	6262000	entertaining there is like no
6262000	6264000	way everybody chews
6264000	6266000	there is no way that's not gonna be entertaining
6266000	6268000	oh god as a lifelong Batman
6268000	6270000	fan I'm kinda resigned to the fact that he kinda
6270000	6272000	goes in cycles you got the goofy Adam
6272000	6274000	Westing kinda thing then you got the ultra
6274000	6276000	super serious reboot and then you
6276000	6278000	got you know it bleeds into the Adam Westing again
6278000	6280000	eh you know come back around
6280000	6282000	I'll give it a chance because everybody
6282000	6284000	hated the idea of Michael Keaton as well
6284000	6286000	and he turned out to be awesome but here's the
6286000	6288000	thing the original Batman was also
6288000	6290000	a Tim Burton movie and then
6290000	6292000	you know who was the guy that did the next trilogy
6292000	6294000	why am I his name is slipping my mind right now
6294000	6296000	no not Schumacher fuck him the next guy
6296000	6298000	those movies were terrible the guy who just did
6298000	6300000	these recent three where did he get the goddamn name
6300000	6302000	oh my god
6302000	6304000	bad fan
6304000	6306000	well I'll put it
6306000	6308000	he proved himself and when he cast Heath Ledger
6308000	6310000	I know a lot of people were skeptical but I was like
6310000	6312000	no Batman Begins was the shit
6312000	6314000	Christopher Nolan thank you Christopher Nolan
6314000	6316000	Batman Begins was the shit
6316000	6318000	this guy knows what he's doing I will trust
6318000	6320000	his judgement but here's the thing Zach
6320000	6322000	Snyder I don't
6322000	6324000	know about you sir
6324000	6326000	for the record by the way I am not
6326000	6328000	going to see it because I am currently
6328000	6330000	on a DC boycott
6330000	6332000	no I'm serious
6332000	6334000	because of how they're
6334000	6336000	treating their writers for their portrayal
6336000	6338000	of women in their comics and
6338000	6340000	for the whole marriage bullshit
6340000	6342000	just so that they don't have to let Batwoman
6342000	6344000	get married yeah that was a little weird
6344000	6346000	also their audition for a new
6346000	6348000	artist here draw Harley Quinn trying to
6348000	6350000	kill herself in three panels sexy
6350000	6352000	underwear sexy yeah that was a little weird
6352000	6354000	DC needs
6354000	6356000	to be a publicist they've seriously
6356000	6358000	fallen off the taste truck
6358000	6360000	off of the progressive taste truck
6360000	6362000	because DC used to be pretty progressive
6362000	6364000	with their characters and hit every branch
6364000	6366000	on the idiot tree and they've fallen
6366000	6368000	into the stinky
6368000	6370000	republican onion truck alright
6370000	6372000	look moving on

6470000	6472000	and it's going to have to be
6472000	6474000	with all these extra people that now want to be a part
6474000	6476000	of it which is a great thing
6476000	6478000	what a horrible situation to be in
6478000	6480000	it's too popular of an event
6480000	6482000	I want to go
6482000	6484000	you can get your tickets now
6484000	6486000	but if you can't get them right now because of financial whatever
6486000	6488000	they'll be on sale until they're not
6488000	6490000	we need to do a panel
6490000	6492000	it'll be fun I think we should
6492000	6494000	let's do a panel
6494000	6496000	alright we'll talk we'll get to talking
6496000	6498000	anyhow gamerX.com if you want more information
6498000	6500000	on that information on Rocksmith
6500000	6502000	2014 edition
6502000	6504000	adding some more songs to kind of round
6504000	6506000	out their song list
6506000	6508000	Rocksmith 2014 edition will include
6508000	6510000	Def Leppard's Pour Some Sugar On Me
6510000	6512000	Queen's
6512000	6514000	We Are The Champions
6514000	6516000	and Mary Jane's Last Dance from Tom Petty
6516000	6518000	and the Heartbreakers
6518000	6520000	and a song for Bobby Rush is going to be in the game
6520000	6522000	with the Spirit of Radio
6522000	6524000	I love Rush. Rush is Canada's best
6524000	6526000	export
6526000	6528000	I still love Alanis Morissette that's the 90's kid in me
6528000	6530000	but anyway some disagree with me
6530000	6532000	but deal with it
6532000	6534000	there's lots of great songs in the game I'm not going to read the entire song list
6534000	6536000	but remember that Rocksmith is like
6536000	6538000	the no really stop hitting plastic
6538000	6540000	buttons and learn how to play an actual
6540000	6542000	guitar so you know
6542000	6544000	if you want to go to guitar school Rocksmith 2014
6544000	6546000	is the way to do it. Also there's
6546000	6548000	what's called color blind mode which I think is
6548000	6550000	pretty cool
6550000	6552000	one of the producers is actually color blind
6552000	6554000	and you can actually adjust the hues
6554000	6556000	and the color saturation levels throughout
6556000	6558000	the entire game to be a little
6558000	6560000	better for the color blind because I guess
6560000	6562000	the first game got a little flack for
6562000	6564000	it so they are going to make it a little better
6564000	6566000	this time around so kudos for accessibility
6566000	6568000	and lastly
6568000	6570000	coming to an arcade
6570000	6572000	near you
6572000	6574000	yes an arcade near you
6574000	6576000	Plants vs. Zombies
6576000	6578000	The Last Stand
6578000	6580000	I'm assuming they turn Plants vs. Zombies
6580000	6582000	into a ticket spitter because that's
6582000	6584000	all arcade games are anymore
6584000	6586000	yeah it is a
6586000	6588000	video redemption product yes yes of course
6588000	6590000	there's already a
6590000	6592000	bejeweled one that surprised me I've never seen one
6592000	6594000	of those but I guess that is out there but yes
6594000	6596000	look for more information on Plants vs. Zombies coming
6596000	6598000	to an arcade near you soon
6598000	6600000	Dark Sakura
6600000	6602000	we're actually having a small discussion
6602000	6604000	in chat by the way
6604000	6606000	there needs to be the Jessica Jones
6606000	6608000	TV show I'm going to cry
6608000	6610000	have you been watching Shield at all?
6610000	6612000	no and I need to
6612000	6614000	but
6614000	6616000	Jessica Jones is my favorite Marvel character
6616000	6618000	ever and if none of you have read
6618000	6620000	Alias which had nothing to do with the TV show
6620000	6622000	read it well if Shield goes anything
6622000	6624000	like another ABC show Once Upon a
6624000	6626000	Time they will roll out
6626000	6628000	those characters just to like
6628000	6630000	make you watch now they have their
6630000	6632000	spin-off yeah they have the spin-off they just released
6632000	6634000	a picture of Jafar apparently for some reason
6634000	6636000	is in Wonderland I'm not even going to try and figure that one
6636000	6638000	out but it's just like you know
6638000	6640000	who can we roll out next?
6640000	6642000	yeah Chell what'd you want to say
6642000	6644000	yeah the character thing
6644000	6646000	I was you know
6646000	6648000	I started watching
6648000	6650000	Once Upon a Time as kind of my trashy show
6650000	6652000	and then I got emotionally involved
6652000	6654000	and then it jumped the shark like
6654000	6656000	whoa and I'm just
6656000	6658000	I'm basically watching it out of train wreck syndrome
6658000	6660000	so yeah I hadn't heard about Jafar
6660000	6662000	but now I need to check out the freaking
6662000	6664000	Alice in Wonderland well here's the thing
6664000	6666000	even I'm not really watching
6666000	6668000	Once Upon a Time but it is like next on my
6668000	6670000	list once I finish off Scandal
6670000	6672000	which is far more important but
6672000	6674000	even I've seen
6674000	6676000	the pictures of Captain Hook
6676000	6678000	and that is uh oh yeah
6678000	6680000	you know I said
6680000	6682000	you know not even Robert Carlyle can get me
6682000	6684000	back for the third series they got me back
6686000	6688000	for my
6688000	6690000	rapid fire news there's
6690000	6692000	I am getting so sick of these
6692000	6694000	websites that are not iPad

6734000	6736000	Six Sided Sanctuary

6738000	6740000	The Sea Will Claim Everything
6740000	6742000	Tiny Barbarian DX
6742000	6744000	lots of really neat games on there and there's also
6744000	6746000	Alphas there's another game on here by the way
6746000	6748000	that's called We'll Fight for Food
6748000	6750000	Nice. Oh this one
6750000	6752000	called Spud's Quest looks cute
6752000	6754000	yeah there's just a lot of neat looking games on there
6754000	6756000	Nice. And in a not
6756000	6758000	so indie game um
6758000	6760000	we all like Borderlands don't we?
6760000	6762000	Well
6762000	6764000	2k and Gearbox
6764000	6766000	have a $100,000
6766000	6768000	worth of prizes for an
6768000	6770000	in-game loot hunt for Borderlands
6770000	6772000	2 so basically on
6772000	6774000	October 11th at 10
6774000	6776000	Eastern Time
6776000	6778000	the game will be altered so
6778000	6780000	that these weird guns are gonna start
6780000	6782000	dropping in odd places
6782000	6784000	so like
6784000	6786000	the knuckle dragger will drop on
6786000	6788000	Gwen's head
6788000	6790000	no sorry the knuckle dragger will drop Gwen's head
6790000	6792000	my apologies
6792000	6794000	so basically you fulfill
6794000	6796000	their little requirements and
6796000	6798000	you could win a prize. I will not tell you
6798000	6800000	anymore about it cause you need to go check it out yourself
6800000	6802000	and then
6802000	6804000	last but not least there is a new Sonic
6804000	6806000	game in development for
6806000	6808000	Xbox One and PS4 and Wii U
6808000	6810000	and
6810000	6812000	I believe it's just a working
6812000	6814000	title Sonic Thunderstorm or Sonic
6814000	6816000	Blue Thunder
6816000	6818000	there is
6818000	6820000	a
6820000	6822000	looks like there's going to be
6822000	6824000	a new character named static
6824000	6826000	the hedgehog and
6826000	6828000	a teenage clone of Sonic Knuckles
6828000	6830000	Rogue Eggman will also have teenage clones
6830000	6832000	and
6832000	6834000	Knuckles clone will be called
6834000	6836000	Slash the Echidna. Hurray more shitty
6836000	6838000	friends static the hedgehog
6838000	6840000	he doesn't move very much
6840000	6842000	he's very placement
6842000	6844000	he's a pretty clingy friend
6844000	6846000	you can also play as Tails, Amy, Debra
6846000	6848000	all these other characters
6848000	6850000	and you also have team Chaotix
6850000	6852000	which is all that I care about
6852000	6854000	29 levels, different objects, return of old animals
6854000	6856000	and chaos drives and
6856000	6858000	the Chao Garden
6858000	6860000	game play will
6860000	6862000	change characters like in Sonic Heroes
6862000	6864000	there's just a bunch of stuff I don't know if it's gonna be any good
6864000	6866000	but there is the return of the chaos emeralds
6866000	6868000	yes but what mode
6868000	6870000	allows me to make them act out
6870000	6872000	my fan fictions
6872000	6874000	none, sit down
6874000	6876000	they're also saying that
6876000	6878000	wi-fi will transfer Chao data
6878000	6880000	and you have a Chao Garden
6880000	6882000	it will be
6882000	6884000	DLC and available in PS Vita and 3DS
6884000	6886000	so
6886000	6888000	yay
6888000	6890000	it better not suck
6890000	6892000	let's hope this is a good Sonic game
6892000	6894000	don't they kind of alternate back and forth
6894000	6896000	like Star Trek movies
6896000	6898000	except that
6898000	6900000	doesn't apply to the
6900000	6902000	Star Trek re-releases
6902000	6904000	the revamps
6904000	6906000	because both of them have been good
6906000	6908000	I think the first one was way better than the second one
6908000	6910000	but that's just me
6910000	6912000	womp womp
6912000	6914000	let's get to
6914000	6916000	the FUGL question
6916000	6918000	of the week
6918000	6920000	every week we ask our listeners
6920000	6922000	a question on Facebook
6922000	6924000	and Google Plus
6924000	6926000	you put that together and you get FUGL
6926000	6928000	the FUGL question of the week and this week
6928000	6930000	as I promised it's gonna be all about Pokemon
6930000	6932000	so we asked our listeners
6932000	6934000	the most important question possibly
6934000	6936000	of the millennium
6936000	6938000	are you team Fennekin
6938000	6940000	Chespin or Froakie
6940000	6942000	and for those that don't know
6942000	6944000	those are the starter Pokemon
6944000	6946000	in the new X and Y
6946000	6948000	they're like Bulbasaur
6948000	6950000	what about option 14 don't give a fuck
6950000	6952000	well actually I did ask
6952000	6954000	as part of the question
6954000	6956000	Pokemon mania looks to be starting all over again
6956000	6958000	in just a week what do you think of Pokemon
6958000	6960000	are you picking up X and Y
6960000	6962000	or are you shocked at the number of grown adults
6962000	6964000	who obsess over Pokemon
6964000	6966000	so let's go to Google Plus first
6966000	6968000	where actdef says team Fennekin
6968000	6970000	and then he gives us a link to a
6970000	6972000	community on livejournal
6972000	6974000	called Pokemon collectors
6974000	6976000	talking about
6976000	6978000	his second question and I see that
6978000	6980000	there's two 3DS's
6980000	6982000	stuffed animals
6982000	6984000	yeah actdef might have a problem
6984000	6986000	but that's okay we still like you
6986000	6988000	he says seriously though
6988000	6990000	I've been a Pokemon fan since the red
6990000	6992000	blue yellow days and I don't see
6992000	6994000	leaving the Pokemon games and
6994000	6996000	fandom in his time soon I'm so hyped for X and Y
6996000	6998000	Jim or excuse me
6998000	7000000	Flaco Jones says
7000000	7002000	despite my love of RPGs I never
7002000	7004000	got into Pokemon in the first place
7004000	7006000	now when they come out with a game it seems like
7006000	7008000	they just expand on old stuff to make the fans
7008000	7010000	happy a new Pokemon release has never
7010000	7012000	said to me hey you've never played this
7012000	7014000	before but this version will really pull
7014000	7016000	you into the series to be fair
7016000	7018000	I think they're trying to do that with X and Y a little bit
7018000	7020000	one thing I noticed about the 3 starter
7020000	7022000	Pokemon is that their final forms
7022000	7024000	kind of fall into the fighter
7024000	7026000	mage thief
7026000	7028000	kind of generalisms
7028000	7030000	you expect in RPGs I found that interesting
7030000	7032000	Evel
7032000	7034000	which
7034000	7036000	might be pronounced that way or E3VL
7036000	7038000	I'm not sure but Evel responds and says
7038000	7040000	I'm only purchasing one version of the game
7040000	7042000	this time around why
7042000	7044000	seeing the diverse age groups who enjoy the franchise
7044000	7046000	I hope the creators make the plot more complex
7046000	7048000	or adult oriented so that varying age
7048000	7050000	demographics may have a more meaningful
7050000	7052000	discussion while playing the game together
7052000	7054000	well yeah but it's Pokemon I mean how
7054000	7056000	deep is it gonna get
7056000	7058000	just saying just saying my personal opinion
7058000	7060000	alright going over to Facebook for some answers
7060000	7062000	Seattle says
7062000	7064000	I'm looking to
7064000	7066000	Team Froakie closely
7066000	7068000	followed by Team Fennekin and I'm picking up
7068000	7070000	Y as soon as I can get into the Evel G
7070000	7072000	to get it as for what I think of the Pokemon
7072000	7074000	series Yellow was the first game that I
7074000	7076000	actually owned so they hold a place in
7076000	7078000	my heart in gaming library which reminds me
7078000	7080000	I need to make an attempt at figuring out what is wrong with my
7080000	7082000	copy of Yellow
7082000	7084000	Shane replied and Shane is Team Chesspin
7084000	7086000	and I have been counting down the days since
7086000	7088000	January which is when they announced the games
7088000	7090000	but had no release dates
7090000	7092000	this is the most important release this year
7092000	7094000	it is already my game of 2013
7094000	7096000	you sound like Loki talking about a different
7096000	7098000	game just a few weeks ago
7098000	7100000	JVMON replies
7100000	7102000	and says Team Froakie I've never
7102000	7104000	chosen a non water starter
7104000	7106000	ever since I chose Squirtle and Pokemon Blue
7106000	7108000	now my only decision is between
7108000	7110000	X and Y lucky I have both reserved
7110000	7112000	so I can decide on release day
7112000	7114000	Pokemon will always be a go to game for me
7114000	7116000	sure the structure is predictable but that's part of the charm
7116000	7118000	For the Fallen Dreams says
7118000	7120000	Team Fennekin motherfuckers
7120000	7122000	I'm 22 and
7122000	7124000	Pokemon will never get old to me
7124000	7126000	it's hands down the best handheld RPG in my
7126000	7128000	opinion it's the sole reason I'm getting a 3DS
7128000	7130000	minus a few other titles it's a breath
7130000	7132000	of fresh air from the constant gore
7132000	7134000	and violence from more adult oriented video games
7134000	7136000	Clover N says
7136000	7138000	my wife and I have pre-ordered an X and
7138000	7140000	a Y I always choose water type
7140000	7142000	and my wife always chooses grass type
7142000	7144000	and let's see
7144000	7146000	going to the next answer
7146000	7148000	Burr says Fennekin all the way
7148000	7150000	I'll see if I can pick it up I haven't actually finished
7150000	7152000	a Pokemon game yet though I got the
7152000	7154000	furthest in blue when I first
7154000	7156000	flirted with it during my freshman year of college
7156000	7158000	TimTrip
7158000	7160000	replied and said gonna have to go with Chespin
7160000	7162000	I don't obsess over Pokemon
7162000	7164000	but there is a lot about it that is surprisingly
7164000	7166000	compelling I don't play every generation
7166000	7168000	because the changes have always been a bit too
7168000	7170000	incremental from the looks of it
7170000	7172000	XY has made some significant forward steps
7172000	7174000	without changing the core of what makes Pokemon
7174000	7176000	fun so I'll be picking up a copy
7176000	7178000	Matt J says I've yet to decide
7178000	7180000	on my starter so can't commit to a team
7180000	7182000	yet I'm not surprised at all that so
7182000	7184000	many adults are into Pokemon I'm nearly 29
7184000	7186000	and still love it however you think
7186000	7188000	folks around my age were kids when the first
7188000	7190000	Pokemon games came out I was only 13
7190000	7192000	when Red and Blue came out here many
7192000	7194000	of us adults grew up on the series it made
7194000	7196000	a mark on us a mark that sticks with us to this
7196000	7198000	day GeoVidea says I
7198000	7200000	don't even have a 3DS yet hoping for
7200000	7202000	it as a holiday gift hint hint
7202000	7204000	and I always pick
7204000	7206000	fire types it's all about the burn
7206000	7208000	Andy R says
7208000	7210000	I got pretty bored with the last few games I didn't even
7210000	7212000	finish white I'm still considering
7212000	7214000	buying X or Y but it will probably depend more on
7214000	7216000	how many of my friends pick it up am I shocked
7216000	7218000	at grown adults obsessing over Pokemon
7218000	7220000	no nostalgia is a powerful force
7220000	7222000	Fifth Dream says Froakie
7222000	7224000	all the way I always pick water type
7224000	7226000	starters unless I'm playing a second game
7226000	7228000	in a generation then I pick a grass
7228000	7230000	I even bought a Team Froakie
7230000	7232000	t-shirt to wear when I go pick up my
7232000	7234000	copy of Pokemon X I'm 39
7234000	7236000	years old so I am one of those
7236000	7238000	grown adults who love Pokemon I've
7238000	7240000	played it since Blue came out and have played
7240000	7242000	every single generation some twice
7242000	7244000	and the spinoffs so yeah Pokemon's great
7244000	7246000	Raginator says I'm on
7246000	7248000	team who gives a fuck finally
7248000	7250000	well I mean we haven't
7250000	7252000	we haven't had anyone yet say
7252000	7254000	I don't care but here's Raginator to
7254000	7256000	break that trend saying I'm not getting
7256000	7258000	Pokemon X and Y I've yet to buy any
7258000	7260000	Pokemon game I'm not going to start now
7260000	7262000	Pokemon is about as interesting as being
7262000	7264000	repeatedly anal probed by aliens
7264000	7266000	non-stop for six months followed by swimming
7266000	7268000	in raw sewage you're nasty
7268000	7270000	you nasty you know what but it's
7270000	7272000	it's hard I don't think one can make
7272000	7274000	a judgement until they've played one yeah what's the
7274000	7276000	why there though I'm not hearing the
7276000	7278000	why do you feel so strongly
7278000	7280000	against Pokemon I'm not hearing that some people
7280000	7282000	just want to be ornery
7282000	7284000	yeah I don't know did you just post that
7284000	7286000	for shock value sir
7286000	7288000	alright degenerate Johnny says I'm with team
7288000	7290000	frokey because it rhymes with Loki
7294000	7296000	alright
7296000	7298000	anyway I'm not at all surprised that so many
7298000	7300000	adults play these games because
7300000	7302000	they want to rub it in the faces of six year olds
7302000	7304000	I mean to dominate six year I mean
7304000	7306000	I really mean never mind I give it up
7306000	7308000	our pal wicked from the
7308000	7310000	nerdgasm network says I've been out of the Pokemon
7310000	7312000	fold since emerald and given how
7312000	7314000	X Y looks like a pseudo reboot
7314000	7316000	it looks like it's time to get back in I'm glad
7316000	7318000	that we're finally getting a game that looks like the
7318000	7320000	anime and while the Pokemon count is
7320000	7322000	count is utterly nutterly butterly
7322000	7324000	I still think there's a lot
7324000	7326000	to be had in collecting them all to collect
7326000	7328000	them all I'm going for frokey
7328000	7330000	because Greninja looks
7330000	7332000	sick as hell plus I'll have a fire
7332000	7334000	starter from the Torchic special
7334000	7336000	event and I can never say no to having a Bulbasaur
7336000	7338000	a well rounded team ahoy
7338000	7340000	uh Hitstun says at the moment I think
7340000	7342000	I'm getting Pokemon X and starting with Chespin
7342000	7344000	once the game's been out for a week and we
7344000	7346000	know more about the popular Pokemon and how to
7346000	7348000	counter pick them I'll be ready to delete
7348000	7350000	my save, start again, and
7350000	7352000	work towards my ideal team from the beginning
7352000	7354000	I already preordered Pokemon
7354000	7356000	Blue fifteen years ago but I skipped
7356000	7358000	generations three and five completely
7358000	7360000	building a good competitive team is a lot
7360000	7362000	of work but it's worth it when the game is new
7362000	7364000	and my friends are playing it too
7364000	7366000	SSG100Matt says Pokemon came out in 1998
7366000	7368000	and I've been playing it since then I'm
7368000	7370000	almost thirty which means I have played
7370000	7372000	Pokemon for half my life
7372000	7374000	I will get Pokemon Y when I finish
7374000	7376000	Black 2 sigh
7376000	7378000	and lastly Codeman I'm
7378000	7380000	not sure about Pokemon I love
7380000	7382000	the blue and red but I just can't add to
7382000	7384000	it the huge amount of games I will have on the
7384000	7386000	table already I will be picking up
7386000	7388000	a 2DS so maybe then I'll try it
7388000	7390000	for now probably not
7390000	7392000	but I was a huge fan of the Pokemon anime
7392000	7394000	it was fantastic so
7394000	7396000	overwhelming Pokemon
7396000	7398000	fans versus non
7398000	7400000	Pokemon fans
7400000	7402000	there
7402000	7404000	and kind of even it sounded pretty even
7404000	7406000	on who's picking up what starter so
7406000	7408000	I will say this that for all the past
7408000	7410000	ones that I have played I've
7410000	7412000	always started with a fire type
7412000	7414000	that's just been me Fennekin's super cute
7414000	7416000	that's what team oh and
7416000	7418000	to answer the question earlier in the show I am team
7418000	7420000	Fennekin absolutely
7420000	7422000	I have no idea what that is
7422000	7424000	he's a little Firefox not to be confused
7424000	7426000	with a popular web browser ok well if he's
7426000	7428000	a fox and on fire maybe I have to get the game
7428000	7430000	let me show you
7430000	7432000	does it like fire
7432000	7434000	oh my god that's fucking cute
7434000	7436000	right
7436000	7438000	that's Fennekin let me show you the others just to compare
7438000	7440000	that's Fennekin do you remember when we went to that E3
7440000	7442000	and I came back with all those damn Pokemon plushies
7442000	7444000	like the plus and minus
7444000	7446000	that's Chespin
7446000	7448000	the grass type oh he looks angry
7448000	7450000	in that particular picture he does here's a
7450000	7452000	happy Chespin just to be fair
7452000	7454000	there you go and uh
7454000	7456000	here is
7456000	7458000	fro-key
7458000	7460000	looking that up right now ew no one gives a shit
7462000	7464000	ok so we know it looks like an old
7464000	7466000	like a frog with a beard on his back
7466000	7468000	ok so Jamie is definitely
7468000	7470000	not team fro-key
7472000	7474000	Fennekin's cute I go with Fennekin
7474000	7476000	even if I'm not getting the game I vote for
7476000	7478000	Fennekin thank you
7478000	7480000	thank you Dark Sakura who has a
7480000	7482000	partially correct opinion
7482000	7484000	hey
7484000	7486000	yeah Act Deaf I had Plessy
7486000	7488000	and Minun whoever
7488000	7490000	but I gave them to my friend
7490000	7492000	Julie because I don't care
7492000	7494000	I was in a good mood this week so I read
7494000	7496000	every single answer I may have
7496000	7498000	cut some of them a little short but check out
7498000	7500000	the full responses at facebook.com
7500000	7502000	slash Orange Lounge Radio and our Google Plus
7502000	7504000	community just search for Orange Lounge Radio
7504000	7506000	on Google and you'll find it and thank
7506000	7508000	you guys for your answers and don't forget
7508000	7510000	those of you out there listening don't forget to follow us
7510000	7512000	on those communities
7512000	7514000	alright more long form news Loki
7514000	7516000	starting us off
7516000	7518000	alright so
7518000	7520000	layoffs
7520000	7522000	god you don't like them
7522000	7524000	but it happens so there's a
7524000	7526000	couple companies laying off people first off
7526000	7528000	Sega of America is confirming
7528000	7530000	an unspecific number of layoffs I'm assuming
7530000	7532000	this is tying in with the fact
7532000	7534000	that you know they are taking on Atlas
7534000	7536000	and perhaps there's just
7536000	7538000	you know
7538000	7540000	some of those jobs kind of overlapping
7540000	7542000	each other
7542000	7544000	so basically
7544000	7546000	as the gaming industry continues to
7546000	7548000	evolve companies must adapt
7548000	7550000	and adjust in order to compete and succeed
7550000	7552000	in an ever changing environment as the
7552000	7554000	result Sega of America has recently undergone
7554000	7556000	a restructure that will enable the
7556000	7558000	company to focus efficiently on developing
7558000	7560000	new and existing content across
7560000	7562000	digital platforms as well as continuing to focus
7562000	7564000	on key brands for packaged goods
7564000	7566000	alright
7566000	7568000	so yeah
7568000	7570000	and then
7570000	7572000	Capcom well that sucks what else can you
7572000	7574000	say I mean I know layoffs are kind of
7574000	7576000	inevitable in this industry but it
7576000	7578000	always makes you sad especially when it's like big companies
7578000	7580000	like Sega you know yeah also
7580000	7582000	Capcom Europe apparently is going
7582000	7584000	to be laying off more than half of its staff
7584000	7586000	and this
7586000	7588000	is coming from I guess MCV
7588000	7590000	who understands more than
7590000	7592000	they're saying more than half of the
7592000	7594000	firm faces redundancy with
7594000	7596000	the number of jobs set to merge
7596000	7598000	so
7598000	7600000	that kind of sucks
7600000	7602000	and I guess following a
7602000	7604000	restructure in the US operation Capcom
7604000	7606000	Europe organization is currently evaluating
7606000	7608000	its structure to ensure it's
7608000	7610000	in the best position to take advantage of the
7610000	7612000	changing market condition the industry is facing
7612000	7614000	in other words they're doing more digital stuff
7614000	7616000	I believe because I think
7616000	7618000	a lot of their
7618000	7620000	you know a lot of franchises I mean they have franchises
7620000	7622000	but there's not a ton of different franchises that they're
7622000	7624000	kind of continually putting out games for
7624000	7626000	well
7626000	7628000	and just to say I want to address something too I see
7628000	7630000	around the internet for those that are saying like
7630000	7632000	you know good or that'll
7632000	7634000	teach Capcom or you know
7634000	7636000	Capcom deserved it or whatever
7636000	7638000	like okay stop stop
7638000	7640000	stop because the people being
7640000	7642000	affected by these layoffs probably
7642000	7644000	have nothing to do with the decisions that you don't like
7644000	7646000	you know that's the way
7646000	7648000	these things go unfortunately is that the people that are
7648000	7650000	actually getting laid off are probably pretty hard working
7650000	7652000	people that are just trying to make a good game
7652000	7654000	and usually these types of decisions
7654000	7656000	come from high up
7656000	7658000	then you can start
7658000	7660000	saying that you know well maybe it's
7660000	7662000	for the best or whatever so
7662000	7664000	yeah I just kind of want to get that out there
7664000	7666000	like don't be all like well should've
7666000	7668000	made the new Mega Man game because
7668000	7670000	that's
7670000	7672000	I mean while that may be true
7672000	7674000	that's like laughing at somebody's
7674000	7676000	face when they're going through tragedy you know
7676000	7678000	did you see what the new Mega Man game was going to look like
7678000	7680000	remember the leaked footage that
7680000	7682000	came out of the cancelled Mega Man game
7682000	7684000	yeah well the 3DS
7684000	7686000	one didn't look bad at all
7686000	7688000	too bad not enough people
7688000	7690000	downloaded the demo or wait they didn't
7690000	7692000	release that no they didn't
7692000	7694000	so yeah but not enough people
7694000	7696000	downloaded the demo because they never released it
7696000	7698000	so yeah but
7698000	7700000	are these layoff news about the people
7700000	7702000	that made that decision probably not
7702000	7704000	it's kind of the equivalent of not tipping
7704000	7706000	your waitress because the food was shitty or
7706000	7708000	you just didn't like it it's you know
7708000	7710000	they're really they're just usually conveying
7710000	7712000	it to you they have no say in it at all
7712000	7714000	unless they spit in it oh yeah
7714000	7716000	that would be yeah
7716000	7718000	alright fair enough alright
7718000	7720000	I have a story that's
7720000	7722000	hopefully a little bit happier news this
7722000	7724000	is something that you know
7724000	7726000	ever since we saw Sony do this with
7726000	7728000	the Playstation 3 and the Playstation Vita
7728000	7730000	we've wondered if Nintendo
7730000	7732000	might do something similar and that is cross by
7732000	7734000	play which on Playstation 3
7734000	7736000	is awesome because who doesn't like more
7736000	7738000	games for more systems for free
7738000	7740000	games like sound shapes and
7740000	7742000	Zen Pinball 2 they have the
7742000	7744000	cross play available or if you buy it on
7744000	7746000	the Playstation 3 you get a copy for the Vita as well
7746000	7748000	well it was questioned
7748000	7750000	of Dan Adelman who is a manager of business
7750000	7752000	development at Nintendo
7752000	7754000	will there be something about cross
7754000	7756000	buy and quote we don't
7756000	7758000	have anything new to announce on that but
7758000	7760000	I believe that the idea has been talked about
7760000	7762000	so if it's something we're definitely up to
7762000	7764000	considering so it's something we're
7764000	7766000	definitely up to considering
7766000	7768000	that's not a non-committal answer I don't know what it is
7768000	7770000	if there's enough demand from developers
7770000	7772000	but nothing to announce for right now
7772000	7774000	so that's interesting this will work
7774000	7776000	in nicely when we announce our
7776000	7778000	you know the brand new technology
7778000	7780000	that we're putting in place to play 3DS
7780000	7782000	games on the Wii U because then you'll
7782000	7784000	buy your 3DS game and play it on
7784000	7786000	your Wii U or on your 3DS
7786000	7788000	because that's totally gonna fucking
7788000	7790000	happen someday it might
7790000	7792000	it's not a might it's an inevitably
7792000	7794000	it's just gonna happen
7794000	7796000	and then cross buy all the things
7796000	7798000	but I can see where they might make that decision
7798000	7800000	leave it up to developers though
7800000	7802000	a developer has a right
7802000	7804000	to double dip if they want even if it
7804000	7806000	you know we don't like it and don't want to
7806000	7808000	support it well a lot of time also
7808000	7810000	with like the 3DS and the
7810000	7812000	Wii U version it's gonna be two
7812000	7814000	different developers on it because you have
7814000	7816000	you know developers that'll do the handheld ports
7816000	7818000	of games and then you'll have the console
7818000	7820000	developers doing that sometimes it's the same team
7820000	7822000	but a lot of times it can be two separate teams
7822000	7824000	so you know it's
7824000	7826000	why would you want to give
7826000	7828000	something away for free considering that they're probably
7828000	7830000	selling plenty of 3DS
7830000	7832000	games and they need to sell more Wii U games
7832000	7834000	so I don't know
7834000	7836000	uh tiger claw on chat
7836000	7838000	says what if they take cross buy a step further
7838000	7840000	speaking on the Sony side now
7840000	7842000	buy the Playstation 4 version and you get
7842000	7844000	not only the Vita version but the PS3
7844000	7846000	version too well we
7846000	7848000	don't know enough about the Gaikai thing it doesn't
7848000	7850000	sound like it's gonna be there at launch and if it will
7850000	7852000	do the Playstation 3 games
7852000	7854000	so I don't think we can assume that yet but
7854000	7856000	um I
7856000	7858000	I don't know like why would you go
7858000	7860000	back and play the Playstation 3 version if you have a
7860000	7862000	Playstation 4 version maybe I'm missing something
7862000	7864000	but I would think the newer one would be
7864000	7866000	a better experience but I mean I don't
7866000	7868000	know I guess I could be wrong there are people that like
7868000	7870000	retro but I'm like if it's the exact same game
7870000	7872000	I don't know oh well
7872000	7874000	anyhow
7874000	7876000	uh let's move on
7876000	7878000	more gaming news Dark Sakura
7878000	7880000	we do have some other gaming news
7880000	7882000	we have
7884000	7886000	a game that
7886000	7888000	I'm not any good at
7888000	7890000	my husband's pretty good at it
7890000	7892000	a lot of people are bitching about this
7892000	7894000	too and I'll tell you why in a second
7894000	7896000	but uh Ikaruga
7896000	7898000	has hit the green light so Treasure's
7898000	7900000	uh wonderful
7900000	7902000	shooter game is going to be
7902000	7904000	out for Steam
7904000	7906000	and apparently though
7906000	7908000	um while it's based
7908000	7910000	off the Xbox 360
7910000	7912000	version it is
7912000	7914000	um
7914000	7916000	going to have I think some different patterns
7916000	7918000	from what I understand so basically
7918000	7920000	people who had the old patterns memorized will have
7920000	7922000	to learn new patterns all over again
7922000	7924000	um so
7924000	7926000	there's also a
7926000	7928000	statement that came from Treasure on Twitter
7928000	7930000	this is new challenge we are trying to distribute
7930000	7932000	Treasure games on Steam
7932000	7934000	so maybe we'll get Radiant Silver Gun next
7934000	7936000	who knows
7938000	7940000	it seems weird they have to go through
7940000	7942000	Steam green light I mean it's Treasure
7942000	7944000	why can't they just put the game on Steam
7944000	7946000	why did they have to go through the green light process
7946000	7948000	let's I mean
7948000	7950000	maybe I'm not being fair here or whatever
7950000	7952000	but it just seems like you know Treasure would be
7952000	7954000	a big enough name that they kind of get to
7954000	7956000	cut ahead for a game like Ikaruga
7956000	7958000	and maybe they're also thinking
7958000	7960000	we might maybe get something like Silhouette
7960000	7962000	Mirage or Troublemakers or
7962000	7964000	maybe they want to see what kind of support they're getting too
7964000	7966000	I think green light actually is a really
7966000	7968000	good way to gauge support because you have that whole
7968000	7970000	voting system so true
7970000	7972000	maybe they don't want to put the effort if
7972000	7974000	there's not going to be enough people clamoring
7974000	7976000	for it but Ikaruga has been
7976000	7978000	popular enough I would love to have
7978000	7980000	an accessible home version
7980000	7982000	of Radiant Silver Gun that would be
7982000	7984000	amazing
7984000	7986000	alright let's move on
7986000	7988000	so Microsoft is promising hey you know
7988000	7990000	we got that brand new Kinect that's going to be
7990000	7992000	coming out with the Xbox One and
7992000	7994000	hey you know that they have that
7994000	7996000	feature now that I guess it
7996000	7998000	allows well the only thing
7998000	8000000	this is really new because I think they have this for the
8000000	8002000	Xbox 360 as well but it
8002000	8004000	can be used in advertising
8004000	8006000	like for example they're saying that
8006000	8008000	Kinect actually recognizes
8008000	8010000	expressions and engagement
8010000	8012000	or can recognize people's faces
8012000	8014000	that
8014000	8016000	you know they could tell you know
8016000	8018000	who's actually watching the ad or start
8018000	8020000	you know targeting ads towards people and stuff
8020000	8022000	and say hey listen you know
8022000	8024000	just because it could be
8024000	8026000	you know using that you know some of the new
8026000	8028000	Xbox One Kinect fixtures
8028000	8030000	could be used in advertising
8030000	8032000	since we see expressions engagement
8032000	8034000	etcetera and how that
8034000	8036000	might be used to target advertising
8036000	8038000	this is the point
8038000	8040000	that seems to draw some controversy first
8040000	8042000	nobody is working on that
8042000	8044000	I'm not aware of any activity
8044000	8046000	or any active work
8046000	8048000	in this space second if something
8048000	8050000	like that ever happened you can
8050000	8052000	be sure that it wouldn't happen without
8052000	8054000	the user having control over it period
8054000	8056000	as they
8056000	8058000	emphasize
8060000	8062000	yeah but at the same time you know
8062000	8064000	there's also all this controversy
8064000	8066000	going on with the NSA and you know
8066000	8068000	they're talking about people
8068000	8070000	being spied on and
8070000	8072000	Microsoft is the first to jump on board with
8072000	8074000	supporting that kind of stuff
8074000	8076000	when we first talked about the mandatory
8076000	8078000	Kinect thing when all that E3
8078000	8080000	shit blew up I said what a
8080000	8082000	horrible time I think we all said
8082000	8084000	what a horrible time for this to be happening with all the
8084000	8086000	NSA stuff that's coming to light right now because that
8086000	8088000	all also happened over the summer and it's like
8088000	8090000	this is not going to help Microsoft's case
8090000	8092000	to make the Kinect mandatory
8092000	8094000	so I mean that thing needs
8094000	8096000	to work and haven't they come out since
8096000	8098000	it's been said it'll be fine if you unplug your Kinect
8098000	8100000	they won 80 on that point didn't they
8100000	8102000	yeah they did and honestly I don't see
8102000	8104000	this as big a huge problem
8104000	8106000	I mean because I mean I'm assuming
8106000	8108000	I haven't really gotten a good peak
8108000	8110000	at the interface and stuff but I'm assuming it's very
8110000	8112000	similar like how the 360 is where
8112000	8114000	you have those tiny little okay well there's
8114000	8116000	let's be honest there's a lot of fucking ads
8116000	8118000	on the 360 dashboard
8118000	8120000	that really probably don't need to be there
8120000	8122000	I mean come on Microsoft's been
8122000	8124000	collecting money for these internet
8124000	8126000	services and stuff and don't give me
8126000	8128000	that oh sorry we need
8128000	8130000	this extra ad revenue to you know
8130000	8132000	cloud things or something I don't know
8132000	8134000	whatever um
8134000	8136000	but I just don't see the point that we need to
8136000	8138000	have even ad people make
8138000	8140000	like these interactive Kinect
8140000	8142000	ads or something because who the fuck
8142000	8144000	is really going to play that or actually
8144000	8146000	you know half the people don't watch those ads
8146000	8148000	anyways and who's going to really want
8148000	8150000	to see an ad where like oh hey
8150000	8152000	throw the mountain do it you know
8152000	8154000	Jeff Gershman or whatever it is
8154000	8156000	so I
8156000	8158000	just
8158000	8160000	Jason in chat says
8160000	8162000	God get over the fucking NSA
8162000	8164000	which you know
8164000	8166000	despite all that political hub
8166000	8168000	baloo it's not that
8168000	8170000	honestly it's not really that that concerns me about the mandatory
8170000	8172000	Kinect which is like you know the Kinect has the voice
8172000	8174000	commands and everything right I just
8174000	8176000	whether legit or
8176000	8178000	not I am paranoid that that thing
8178000	8180000	would capture a really
8180000	8182000	unflattering picture in an inopportune
8182000	8184000	or something or you know
8184000	8186000	those things are going to be able to broadcast online and call
8186000	8188000	people with voice commands and stuff so it's like
8188000	8190000	hey I recognize Rob has the mountain do in front
8190000	8192000	of him I'm going to take a picture look he's doing the do
8192000	8194000	with underwear on
8196000	8198000	the listeners thank you for that
8198000	8200000	visual Loki but
8200000	8202000	no for like for real like you know
8202000	8204000	I'm I would my plan all along
8204000	8206000	was just to turn the
8206000	8208000	Kinect to face the wall when I'm not
8208000	8210000	playing probably
8210000	8212000	that's what I do with my current Kinect
8212000	8214000	is just turn and face the TV or you know
8214000	8216000	turn around the other way when I'm not playing and it's none
8216000	8218000	the wiser throw a shirt on it like poltergeist
8218000	8220000	right yes that's a great
8220000	8222000	answer too and then the Kinect's like
8222000	8224000	hello are you still there
8224000	8226000	there you
8226000	8228000	are
8228000	8230000	advertisements
8230000	8232000	you know what I think
8232000	8234000	would be fun is like make one
8234000	8236000	of those little room boxes out
8236000	8238000	of a shoebox you know a little stick figure people
8238000	8240000	and then put it in front of the box
8240000	8242000	just so that that's all it sees
8242000	8244000	is the stick figure
8244000	8246000	room box these people are really
8246000	8248000	skinny and made of popsicle
8248000	8250000	sticks like put like um
8250000	8252000	like Halloween full
8252000	8254000	people sitting on my couch
8254000	8256000	so the Kinect thinks somebody's sitting on my
8256000	8258000	couch 24 hours a day 7 days a week
8258000	8260000	that somebody literally died on my couch
8260000	8262000	you know what you get
8262000	8264000	put a blow up doll on your couch
8264000	8266000	and then that's all it sees
8266000	8268000	wow
8268000	8270000	a hardcore pornography
8270000	8272000	alright
8272000	8274000	we should just put a continuous loop
8274000	8276000	video of Elizabeth Berkley
8276000	8278000	doing the pool scene
8278000	8280000	you don't know shit
8280000	8282000	of course why are there so many
8282000	8284000	showgirls references tonight
8284000	8286000	not that I'm complaining alright
8286000	8288000	well I think a lot of people are complaining about this
8288000	8290000	Half Life 3
8290000	8292000	was trademarked in Europe this week
8292000	8294000	that's right
8294000	8296000	the office for harmonization in the internal
8296000	8298000	market or whatever that is
8298000	8300000	in the European Union forgive my
8300000	8302000	ignorance that's just an overseas
8302000	8304000	agency
8304000	8306000	trademarked Half Life 3 this week being owned
8306000	8308000	by Valve Corporation
8308000	8310000	the trademark covers computer game software
8310000	8312000	it was filed on September 29th blah
8312000	8314000	blah blah blah but
8314000	8316000	it was fake y'all
8316000	8318000	as sometimes happens with
8318000	8320000	the trademarks this
8320000	8322000	was a fake it was therefore
8322000	8324000	removed from the trademark
8324000	8326000	it was actually a part of the actual website
8326000	8328000	or whatever the
8328000	8330000	entrant disappeared completely
8330000	8332000	and yeah it's
8332000	8334000	it's not there anymore
8334000	8336000	is this what we've come down to?
8336000	8338000	trolling with fake trademarks
8338000	8340000	same thing happened in World of Warcraft
8340000	8342000	same thing happens over there
8342000	8344000	whatever
8344000	8346000	you know what when Valve's ready
8346000	8348000	they'll fucking say something
8348000	8350000	to them
8350000	8352000	it's happening soon
8352000	8354000	so then you have a 1 in 300
8354000	8356000	you have a
8356000	8358000	300 opportunities to get a really nice PC
8358000	8360000	in your house
8360000	8362000	that's right that's the way I'm looking at it
8362000	8364000	alright we'll see
8364000	8366000	who plays Half Life 3 hey I guess that's a bonus
8366000	8368000	hey Rob
8368000	8370000	it's a fake
8370000	8372000	yes it is
8372000	8374000	alright let's get to the mailbag
8374000	8376000	every week you kids email us
8376000	8378000	and DarkSakura dives in the email
8378000	8380000	bag head first and picks out a few of her
8380000	8382000	favorite emails to read for you
8382000	8384000	why do you have to tell everyone to send all those
8384000	8386000	emails I know we got a lot this week
8386000	8388000	thank you listeners
8388000	8390000	I'm gonna be hilarious if Gabe Newell is just sitting over there
8390000	8392000	he's like ah I'm gonna totally register that
8392000	8394000	yep yep I just did it
8394000	8396000	no I didn't hah
8396000	8398000	I totally fooled all those guys
8398000	8400000	it's hilarious
8400000	8402000	luckily Gabe Newell is not a troll like you
8402000	8404000	you don't know that
8404000	8406000	so I am super excited about Beyond Two Souls
8406000	8408000	I loved Heavy Rain despite its flaws
8408000	8410000	and from what I've played in the demo so far
8410000	8412000	this game seems to have corrected a lot of the issues
8412000	8414000	people complained about in that first game
8414000	8416000	I wanted to talk about playing
8416000	8418000	excuse me
8418000	8420000	I want to talk about playing the game via this app called Beyond Touch
8420000	8422000	sounds kinky
8422000	8424000	they designed the game to be fully playable
8424000	8426000	without a controller at all
8426000	8428000	but with an app you can download for iOS and Android
8428000	8430000	if you'd like to
8430000	8432000	it sounds like it's an easier way to play
8432000	8434000	is it more accessible for people who aren't traditional gamers
8434000	8436000	this along with marketing the game
8436000	8438000	like a movie and even premiering footage
8438000	8440000	of the Tribeca Film Festival
8440000	8442000	make me feel like they're really trying to
8442000	8444000	make the game appeal to a wider audience
8444000	8446000	do you think this could backfire?
8446000	8448000	I guess it depends on which experience
8448000	8450000	is the better one
8450000	8452000	because I can see gamers getting upset
8452000	8454000	but don't they always?
8454000	8456000	if the traditional controller play is inferior to the app play
8456000	8458000	or is this just good business sense
8458000	8460000	and would you like to see more games do this?
8460000	8462000	I think it's a good idea
8462000	8464000	I think gamers are going to be pissed off anyway
8464000	8466000	so it doesn't matter
8466000	8468000	I think the point is
8468000	8470000	the bottom line, making the money
8470000	8472000	making the money means selling the game
8472000	8474000	selling the games makes it accessible to more people
8474000	8476000	so there you go
8476000	8478000	that's my thought
8478000	8480000	and also making these sort of apps
8480000	8482000	that work with games
8482000	8484000	are basically just a way to get people
8484000	8486000	to talk about said game
8486000	8488000	as we just did
8488000	8490000	there's a lot of MMOs too
8490000	8492000	like having the Warcraft app
8492000	8494000	is a great example
8494000	8496000	you can actually chat to your guild mates
8496000	8498000	from the Warcraft app on the phone
8498000	8500000	you can actually still be in the game
8500000	8502000	while you're not playing the game
8502000	8504000	there's been calls to make that enrichment even stronger
8504000	8506000	but even non-MMO games had it
8506000	8508000	Mass Effect had that little companion app
8508000	8510000	that meant you didn't have to do multiplayer
8510000	8512000	which I still sometimes use
8512000	8514000	it's off the store by the way
8514000	8516000	it's officially gone
8516000	8518000	that reminds me since
8518000	8520000	Microsoft came out with this wonderful app
8520000	8522000	called Smart Glass last year
8522000	8524000	as part of the Xbox 360 thing
8524000	8526000	it's something that's going to be included in the Xbox One
8526000	8528000	have they even shown anything that
8528000	8530000	uses that yet?
8530000	8532000	have they shown anything that's going to
8532000	8534000	I think they were talking about enhancements
8534000	8536000	for Xbox One
8536000	8538000	but as far as the 360 is concerned
8538000	8540000	I think it's a lost cause
8540000	8542000	I understand that, but I'm talking about the Xbox One
8542000	8544000	have they even shown anything Smart Glass does?
8544000	8546000	other than mention it, like, hey
8546000	8548000	these games are going to use Smart Glass
8548000	8550000	because I know we've seen stuff with Watch Dogs
8550000	8552000	and stuff like that, but they have their own dedicated apps
8552000	8554000	for that thing, it's not really Smart Glass
8554000	8556000	it's kind of this other thing
8556000	8558000	so
8558000	8560000	yeah, I thought the Halo 4 Smart Glass thing
8560000	8562000	was great until I was like, oh, it's just another app
8562000	8564000	in the store, alright, whatever
8564000	8566000	so they just kind of
8566000	8568000	I think it's meant more
8568000	8570000	for movies
8570000	8572000	like being a second screen experience
8572000	8574000	for movies and TV, but
8574000	8576000	we'll see, I will admit
8576000	8578000	TV on the Wii U
8578000	8580000	is kind of neat, and it's a bummer
8580000	8582000	more people don't use it, it's kind of a neat
8582000	8584000	little second screen experience where you can kind of chat with people
8584000	8586000	as big shows are happening and stuff, but
8586000	8588000	it would be neat if there was something like that
8588000	8590000	on Xbox, but I don't know, we'll see
8590000	8592000	alright, next email
8592000	8594000	yes
8594000	8596000	Hey, OLR, it's your friendly neighborhood turtle
8596000	8598000	I wanted to share a quick, funny story
8598000	8600000	my wife was downstairs last night cooking dinner
8600000	8602000	when she heard me let out a shriek
8602000	8604000	as if my soul was being ripped out
8604000	8606000	she ran upstairs, concerned that I had hurt myself
8606000	8608000	and found me laughing at myself playing
8608000	8610000	Alan Wake. I was pretty embarrassed
8610000	8612000	she had a good chuckle at that
8612000	8614000	sorry, I'm laughing because I'm like
8614000	8616000	what does one's soul being ripped out
8616000	8618000	sound like? But then I thought
8618000	8620000	back earlier in the show to that Pokemon
8620000	8622000	fighting video somebody linked us to
8622000	8624000	and I'm like, oh, it probably sounded like that
8624000	8626000	Loki, can't wait for GTA 5
8626000	8628000	to come out on PC, I refused to buy it twice
8628000	8630000	and then this one's to me
8630000	8632000	I hope that this week you aren't sick
8632000	8634000	you know what?
8634000	8636000	I'm not sick all the time
8636000	8638000	how are you feeling right now, you good?
8638000	8640000	allergies
8640000	8642000	having allergies is not the same as being sick
8642000	8644000	and granted
8644000	8646000	I also got stung by an asshole
8646000	8648000	wasp
8648000	8650000	which I'm sure Rachel will attest to
8650000	8652000	I get pretty sick from
8652000	8654000	waspies
8654000	8656000	it was at her house
8656000	8658000	keep on being fabulous
8658000	8660000	will do
8660000	8662000	I look forward to downloading the podcast
8662000	8664000	every Monday morning so I can listen to it while working
8664000	8666000	keep up the good times, your loyal turtle
8666000	8668000	in Philadelphia, serious turtle
8668000	8670000	next email
8670000	8672000	it's nice to know I'm not the only one that screams
8672000	8674000	like crazy playing scary video games
8674000	8676000	but nobody's as bad as Gamet
8676000	8678000	y'all, I don't know if he's still listening, I just had to
8678000	8680000	rez him you know what?
8680000	8682000	if a game scares me, I actually
8682000	8684000	you've seen me on scary
8684000	8686000	rides, I don't make a noise
8686000	8688000	if I am truly freaked out
8688000	8690000	or scared
8690000	8692000	I freeze up, get the big eyes
8692000	8694000	and I am completely unable
8694000	8696000	to speak
8696000	8698000	the only time I rode tower of terror
8698000	8700000	I was literally mute
8700000	8702000	for the next 30 minutes
8702000	8704000	I could not speak
8704000	8706000	note to self, get Jamie to ride
8706000	8708000	tower of terror before OLR
8708000	8710000	not even funny Rob
8710000	8712000	oh come on, it's just a joke
8712000	8714000	yeah but it's a real thing and it's horrible
8714000	8716000	so I will sit through
8716000	8718000	a scary movie and just like
8718000	8720000	eyes wide open and won't say anything
8720000	8722000	you know I'm scared if I haven't said shit
8724000	8726000	next email
8726000	8728000	hello OLR, although PS4 certainly has
8728000	8730000	a very positive vibe about it, I was very
8730000	8732000	compelled to buy a Playstation console for the first time
8732000	8734000	I decided to get an Xbox One
8734000	8736000	anyway, the reason might sound strange
8736000	8738000	but it's Kinect that convinced me, I like
8738000	8740000	the first Kinect a lot
8740000	8742000	for several reasons
8742000	8744000	for the first time I could play video games with everyone
8744000	8746000	around me, my girlfriend likes it and she's very good at it
8746000	8748000	kicking my virtual ass all the time
8748000	8750000	even my dad and mom play from time to time
8750000	8752000	and they never played video games before
8752000	8754000	everyone likes it because it's so simple to use
8754000	8756000	even more simple than
8756000	8758000	Wii
8758000	8760000	or PS
8760000	8762000	there must be a typo, or PS Move
8762000	8764000	since no buttons are used at all
8764000	8766000	also Kinect is a fresh wind and gaming that is needed
8766000	8768000	it's something completely different
8768000	8770000	than just another
8770000	8772000	standard first person shooter
8774000	8776000	that's why I don't get why Kinect gets all the hate
8776000	8778000	because it sucks
8778000	8780000	mostly from so called hardcore gamers
8780000	8782000	sure it's not perfect at all
8782000	8784000	and it has to prove itself a lot more
8784000	8786000	that's why Kinect 2 needs to get it right this time
8786000	8788000	but I think that it's an important step forward
8788000	8790000	in the general development of gaming
8790000	8792000	a step of which we don't understand
8792000	8794000	its importance yet
8794000	8796000	a step as important as the joystick
8796000	8798000	or am I giving it too much credit?
8798000	8800000	yes
8800000	8802000	what if Kinect becomes well used and mainstream?
8802000	8804000	god I hope not
8804000	8806000	what would be the next step in gaming beyond that?
8806000	8808000	as always I'm very thankful for you guys making a podcast every week
8808000	8810000	Fabrice from Belgium
8810000	8812000	and I am super opinionated about it
8812000	8814000	I don't like the Kinect
8814000	8816000	I don't have fun with the Kinect
8816000	8818000	I've never had fun with the Kinect
8818000	8820000	if I want to play something that's going to involve
8820000	8822000	me using motion
8822000	8824000	I want a peripheral
8824000	8826000	I want my dance pads for DDR
8826000	8828000	or my maracas for samba
8828000	8830000	I want something that's going to be
8830000	8832000	specifically related to the game
8832000	8834000	that I'm playing
8834000	8836000	I hated
8836000	8838000	I don't like watching myself
8838000	8840000	maybe it's just a me thing
8840000	8842000	but even though I had a lot of fun
8842000	8844000	with Dance Masters
8844000	8846000	to do Para Para
8846000	8848000	I could not watch the screen
8848000	8850000	if that made sense
8850000	8852000	I did all the stupid Para Para dances with my eyes closed
8852000	8854000	well you can also turn off your silhouettes in that game
8854000	8856000	if you really want to
8856000	8858000	well here's the thing about Kinect
8858000	8860000	yeah I might razz on Kinect a little bit
8860000	8862000	but I get that it's
8862000	8864000	super accessible
8864000	8866000	and that people who don't even play a lot of games
8866000	8868000	will be like oh what's that dance game
8868000	8870000	oh that looks kind of neat I can do that
8870000	8872000	I can just move and play the game
8872000	8874000	I get where it's highly accessible
8874000	8876000	but for me the thing that really bothers me about Kinect
8876000	8878000	is it's like the same three punchlines over and over
8878000	8880000	it's dance and fitness
8880000	8882000	it's
8882000	8884000	or I should say it's dance games
8884000	8886000	it's fitness games
8886000	8888000	and once in a while other weird
8888000	8890000	voice integrations and things
8890000	8892000	I haven't really seen a lot of Kinect games that made me go
8892000	8894000	wow this is the future of gaming
8894000	8896000	a system is only as good as the games that are on it
8896000	8898000	right?
8898000	8900000	and I thought maybe like Child of Eden
8900000	8902000	that was kind of neat but that was like one game
8902000	8904000	there hasn't been a lot that I feel
8904000	8906000	has really pushed gaming forward
8906000	8908000	which is why it really surprised me when they said
8908000	8910000	Xbox One is going to require it
8910000	8912000	and I'm like oh my god
8912000	8914000	but this joke is dying fast
8914000	8916000	if they're going to use the Kinect
8916000	8918000	they need to do Kinect plus Oculus Rift or something
8918000	8920000	and maybe that would be real immersive
8920000	8922000	that might be a little scary
8922000	8924000	that would be lawn mower man
8924000	8926000	but still
8926000	8928000	I personally have very little interest in it
8928000	8930000	I usually play a game
8930000	8932000	because it's my relaxing thing to do
8932000	8934000	I would rather go to the gym
8934000	8936000	if I was going to exercise
8936000	8938000	which I do anyway
8938000	8940000	so what's the point?
8940000	8942000	I saw a thing with the Kinect and the Oculus Rift
8942000	8944000	and a stationary bike
8944000	8946000	for the paperboy thing
8946000	8948000	yeah I was going to say
8948000	8950000	I'm pretty sure those mods are out there
8950000	8952000	because if you think about it
8952000	8954000	Oculus Rift, PC, Kinect
8954000	8956000	they have PC devices and things
8956000	8958000	or drivers and things for that too
8958000	8960000	so it's out there
8960000	8962000	I'm sure it's probably a pain in the butt to develop for
8962000	8964000	Kinect always reminds me of
8964000	8966000	it's in the book of Hitchhiker's Guide
8966000	8968000	because you can't really translate this into a movie
8968000	8970000	but it talks about how their society
8970000	8972000	goes from push button to touch screen
8972000	8974000	to Kinect like thing
8974000	8976000	and it finally ends up where Zefod Beelbrox
8976000	8978000	is sitting on the bridge of Heart of Gold
8978000	8980000	trying to listen to music
8980000	8982000	and you have to operate these systems
8982000	8984000	you have to sit absolutely still
8984000	8986000	because any motion towards the console
8986000	8988000	whatsoever is going to trigger
8988000	8990000	that to me seems like
8990000	8992000	that's where we're going with this
8992000	8994000	yeah I hear ya
8994000	8996000	I hear ya
8996000	8998000	alright so next email
8998000	9000000	god we still have four emails
9000000	9002000	oh my god really?
9002000	9004000	Kiflom O.L.R. it's degenerate Johnny
9004000	9006000	it's a GTA 5 reference ask Loki what that means
9006000	9008000	okay
9008000	9010000	is it wet now?
9010000	9012000	Kiflom
9012000	9014000	oh yeah it's the
9014000	9016000	made up uh
9016000	9018000	Scientology um
9018000	9020000	it's what they say to each other
9020000	9022000	I couldn't help but notice the argument
9022000	9024000	that wasn't really an argument
9024000	9026000	that Jamie Loki had last week over their taste
9026000	9028000	in video games I'm often entertained
9028000	9030000	by your arguments but they sometimes
9030000	9032000	have a tense feel about them just an observation
9032000	9034000	the beauty of interactive entertainment
9034000	9036000	is that there's a variety of good games that will
9036000	9038000	appeal to many but not to everyone
9038000	9040000	it's for this reason why
9040000	9042000	Alan doesn't play Dead Space
9042000	9044000	why Bobby doesn't play shooters
9044000	9046000	why Rob doesn't play Cookie Clicker
9046000	9048000	that's not true
9048000	9050000	personally I don't
9050000	9052000	very much care for the Elder Scrolls series
9052000	9054000	melee combat and the first person perspective
9054000	9056000	doesn't work well for me
9056000	9058000	as an individual who appreciates both game series
9058000	9060000	I can see why one of the main problems between
9060000	9062000	Mass Effect and GTA
9062000	9064000	involves a relationship between stories and gameplay
9064000	9066000	I may be generalizing here but
9066000	9068000	Mass Effect's heavily involved story and dialogue
9068000	9070000	often gets in the way of the stellar gameplay
9070000	9072000	I know
9072000	9074000	the dialogue can be skipped but
9074000	9076000	some people just want to play the game
9076000	9078000	the opposite can be said about GTA 5
9078000	9080000	the variety of side missions and extra
9080000	9082000	activities in the game
9082000	9084000	can often
9084000	9086000	derail a game's superbly written stories
9086000	9088000	and that's what we call ooh a piece of candy
9088000	9090000	factor in the end it's different
9090000	9092000	strokes for different folks
9092000	9094000	I didn't think it was an argument was it?
9094000	9096000	there was definitely
9096000	9098000	a heated discussion
9098000	9100000	on last week's show but I don't
9100000	9102000	think that was arguing so much as it was
9102000	9104000	passionate viewpoints and
9104000	9106000	don't mistake the two because
9106000	9108000	hello we've been doing this show
9108000	9110000	11 and a half years do you think
9110000	9112000	yes we're going to get a little heated
9112000	9114000	when we disagree on topics sometimes
9114000	9116000	Rob I disagree with you all the time
9116000	9118000	fuck off I'm just kidding
9118000	9120000	you know I love you
9120000	9122000	and we've been doing this a very long time
9122000	9124000	so of course there's going to be opinions
9124000	9126000	there's a little bit of stubbornness that comes
9126000	9128000	with that passion but I think everybody here on the show
9128000	9130000	is stubborn to a point
9130000	9132000	yes we're very set in our ways
9132000	9134000	but when there's a good
9134000	9136000	viewpoint expressed
9136000	9138000	I don't think any of us are beyond saying
9138000	9140000	I disagree with you
9140000	9142000	but I hear what you're saying
9142000	9144000	yeah I got a little heated last week
9144000	9146000	but there's definitely
9146000	9148000	some deep rooted issues
9148000	9150000	that Grand Theft Auto 5 makes us face
9150000	9152000	that people are passionate about
9152000	9154000	for a very good reason
9154000	9156000	the next part of the email
9156000	9158000	I also want to address the misconception of the
9158000	9160000	GTA series having a misogynistic
9160000	9162000	atmosphere even though GTA
9162000	9164000	has often been littered with prostitutes and
9164000	9166000	strippers the game series has had
9166000	9168000	a variety of strong female characters
9168000	9170000	dating back to GTA 3
9170000	9172000	I'm going to go ahead and say this having a few
9172000	9174000	strong female characters does not make up
9174000	9176000	for misogyny just saying
9176000	9178000	the one thing about the GTA
9178000	9180000	series is that it plays the role
9180000	9182000	of social commentator in the world we live
9182000	9184000	in today i.e. life provider
9184000	9186000	equals Facebook medical cocaine
9186000	9188000	equals marijuana
9188000	9190000	GTA 5 is no exception to this because it often
9190000	9192000	has commented against our patriarchal
9192000	9194000	society throughout the game
9194000	9196000	even though there is yet to be
9196000	9198000	a lead female character in the GTA
9198000	9200000	series GTA 5 has strong female characters
9200000	9202000	throughout the story one such example
9202000	9204000	is
9204000	9206000	I'm trying to get to this is female crew
9206000	9208000	members that you can select for heists
9208000	9210000	many of the
9210000	9212000	most skilled crew recruits are women and they
9212000	9214000	know it which is why they get a higher take from
9214000	9216000	jobs than the male crew recruits
9216000	9218000	not to mention GTA
9218000	9220000	Online offers the option for you to be a
9220000	9222000	woman with that being said maybe sometime
9222000	9224000	in the future we could expect Jamie to join the
9224000	9226000	VoG crew to take down the patriarchal douche bags
9226000	9228000	and infest the online community I'm actually
9228000	9230000	already working on something for that but more later
9230000	9232000	anyways
9232000	9234000	as an individual who has a significant appreciation
9234000	9236000	for strong women in video games
9236000	9238000	the KOTOR series Final Fantasy 12
9238000	9240000	Mirrors Edge I just wanted to add in my
9240000	9242000	two cents sincerely degenerate Johnny
9242000	9244000	I think what my problem
9244000	9246000	is more with the
9246000	9248000	misogynistic presentation
9248000	9250000	in the game is the fact that it
9250000	9252000	is coming from
9252000	9254000	real life
9254000	9256000	that it's an aspect of
9256000	9258000	real life that seems to be
9260000	9262000	almost
9262000	9264000	an ingrained part of culture
9264000	9266000	that shouldn't be
9266000	9268000	that we should strive to be better than
9268000	9270000	I have to make a tough
9270000	9272000	counterpoint though or at least I see it as one though
9272000	9274000	that isn't the point of Grand Theft Auto
9274000	9276000	and I kind of see it in this email too
9276000	9278000	isn't the point of Grand Theft Auto to be
9278000	9280000	over the top and silly
9280000	9282000	and ridiculous so yes
9282000	9284000	there's misogyny but it is presented
9284000	9286000	very tongue in cheek that maybe
9286000	9288000	people and I'm gonna
9288000	9290000	use something you've said on the show before
9290000	9292000	maybe people are looking to be offended
9292000	9294000	is it possible?
9294000	9296000	I
9300000	9302000	I think
9302000	9304000	it's not necessarily just a matter of looking
9304000	9306000	to be offended people are going to
9306000	9308000	be offended as a reaction
9308000	9310000	and as I've often
9310000	9312000	said not necessarily on the show
9312000	9314000	but in real life
9314000	9316000	you can't necessarily help
9316000	9318000	a reaction you can help
9318000	9320000	by acting instead of acting
9320000	9322000	on your reaction so
9322000	9324000	I think that the problem being
9324000	9326000	is that illustrating that
9326000	9328000	yeah this is a part of society
9328000	9330000	the fact
9330000	9332000	that it has to be something that's brought
9332000	9334000	up in a game to be a realistic
9334000	9336000	parody means that something that needs
9336000	9338000	more attention to be combated if that
9338000	9340000	makes sense. Yeah
9340000	9342000	it's something to think about
9342000	9344000	and I mean and you know
9344000	9346000	honestly it was a big turn off for me
9346000	9348000	in trying to play the game
9348000	9350000	I've sat and watched a bunch
9350000	9352000	of the missions in the game while Dan played because
9352000	9354000	I could not touch
9354000	9356000	the PS3 any time
9356000	9358000	Dan was home because he was always
9358000	9360000	playing that game and I watched
9360000	9362000	a lot of it but after a while there's just like
9362000	9364000	so much you can
9364000	9366000	take before you're like
9366000	9368000	wow I've hit my saturation point I
9368000	9370000	feel really
9370000	9372000	down
9372000	9374000	you know
9374000	9376000	it's a really
9376000	9378000	hard thing to put a finger on because
9378000	9380000	I think I'm hearing that maybe the problem
9380000	9382000	is that like okay yeah the joke
9382000	9384000	is funny the first 500 times
9384000	9386000	yeah but there's only so much
9386000	9388000	you want to hear
9388000	9390000	derogatory terms being used toward women
9390000	9392000	even if it's done in a parody
9392000	9394000	since after a while it really does
9394000	9396000	stop being funny. Chell wants to chime
9396000	9398000	in here. I think this is
9398000	9400000	you know if we are going along the lines of GTA
9400000	9402000	as a big over the top parody is
9402000	9404000	it sounds like it's kind of falling prey to
9404000	9406000	Dave Chappelle syndrome where
9406000	9408000	after a certain point he stopped doing the show
9408000	9410000	because he realized the wrong people
9410000	9412000	were laughing at his jokes because
9412000	9414000	there's only so far you can go with ironic racism
9414000	9416000	before it just loops around and becomes
9416000	9418000	good old fashioned racism
9418000	9420000	and that seems like what's
9420000	9422000	happening a bit here you know the parody is getting
9422000	9424000	too close to the truth and
9424000	9426000	it's you know it stops
9426000	9428000	being funny for some people like
9428000	9430000	it's my two cents
9430000	9432000	I actually fully agree with that
9432000	9434000	that is
9434000	9436000	on the money.
9436000	9438000	Alright well in the interest of time I'm going to ask Jamie to go to the next
9438000	9440000	email but keep those emails coming on
9440000	9442000	this topic or tweets
9442000	9444000	mailbag at orangelandradio.com or twitter.com
9444000	9446000	slash o-l-r
9446000	9448000	Well since Ragenator just told me to skip
9448000	9450000	his email I'm skipping it
9450000	9452000	sorry
9452000	9454000	I don't know I might go back to it. Roll it over next week
9454000	9456000	I guess. God this one's
9456000	9458000	long too.
9458000	9460000	No I mean it's fucking really fucking
9460000	9462000	long. It's from Ralston UT
9462000	9464000	oh
9464000	9466000	no it's
9466000	9468000	really okay I'm gonna
9468000	9470000	go for it.
9470000	9472000	Can we try to get a TLDR
9472000	9474000	version of it?
9474000	9476000	Just for time's sake. I'm gonna just read the first
9476000	9478000	paragraph because it has to do with what we just
9478000	9480000	talked about. Here's my suggestion you go to the next email
9480000	9482000	I'll read I'll skim this email
9482000	9484000	and try to pick out the key points.
9484000	9486000	Hey o-l-r gang as I typically
9486000	9488000	save this show for my commute 2 plus hours
9488000	9490000	a day I don't have much opportunity to call
9490000	9492000	into the show. I noticed that the mailbag
9492000	9494000	has been fairly empty lately so
9494000	9496000	I had a suggestion why not address comments
9496000	9498000	from the podcast entries on the vog network page
9498000	9500000	as well. By the way
9500000	9502000	I'm well into my first playthrough of Mass Effect
9502000	9504000	2 just in case there wasn't a requisite mention
9504000	9506000	of Mass Effect elsewhere in the show.
9506000	9508000	I've also been playing Dragon
9508000	9510000	Fantasy Book 1 on my PS Vita which
9510000	9512000	is hilariously old school 8 bit RPG
9512000	9514000	in tradition of the early Dragon
9514000	9516000	Quest games. Until next time
9516000	9518000	John K. Critical Myth
9518000	9520000	Great question from Critical Myth
9520000	9522000	we do try to incorporate the
9522000	9524000	vog network comics
9524000	9526000	comments especially on a slower
9526000	9528000	news week but we haven't done them
9528000	9530000	in a while to be fair and I might actually
9530000	9532000	be confusing with Horde House because I know we do
9532000	9534000	vog comments more often over there but
9534000	9536000	certainly I mean the thing
9536000	9538000	about the vog comments I tend to
9538000	9540000	just respond to them on the spot
9540000	9542000	like when I see those comments I can't
9542000	9544000	wait for Sunday I just have to respond
9544000	9546000	on the spot so if you want to get something
9546000	9548000	right away the vog comments are the
9548000	9550000	place to go but if there's like a really good
9550000	9552000	point or counterpoint or something
9552000	9554000	brought up it's gonna come to the show
9554000	9556000	one way or another. I'm gonna inevitably
9556000	9558000	say yeah somebody was posting about this on vog
9558000	9560000	you know. Well while you're back
9560000	9562000	to scanning that one I'll read
9562000	9564000	Raginator's
9564000	9566000	email. Okay you got it. Since it's short
9566000	9568000	Hi all this is everyone's favorite email
9568000	9570000	or hero to many and a total amazing all
9570000	9572000	around guy Raginator.
9572000	9574000	Hey it was on the email
9574000	9576000	so I said it. I just thought
9576000	9578000	I'd pose a little food for thought this week
9578000	9580000	it's fairly common knowledge that I've
9580000	9582000	traditionally been a console gamer since 1981
9582000	9584000	and it wasn't until after
9584000	9586000	last year's break in my moving and the replacement
9586000	9588000	of my computer where I actually started playing PC
9588000	9590000	games albeit reluctantly at first
9590000	9592000	as late as
9592000	9594000	August 2012 I would have scoffed at the notion
9594000	9596000	of PC gaming having been a console fan
9596000	9598000	boy for the better part of my life.
9598000	9600000	Now that I've been on Steam for a while now
9600000	9602000	plus having played Diablo 2 as well
9602000	9604000	I'm quite thoroughly enjoying PC gaming.
9604000	9606000	I also as of late
9606000	9608000	been questioning whether or not I
9608000	9610000	really need to replace my PS3.
9610000	9612000	That being said I'd like to pose
9612000	9614000	this question. Have any of you been in a
9614000	9616000	situation where you enjoyed X so much
9616000	9618000	do you question whether or not to replace Y?
9618000	9620000	This email has been brought to you by
9620000	9622000	the clearly superior Japanese soundtrack
9622000	9624000	Japanese version of the Sonic CD soundtrack
9624000	9626000	the US version is just lame y'all better recognize
9626000	9628000	for the record I don't think it's
9628000	9630000	lame I just think the Japanese music
9630000	9632000	is better. Thank you
9632000	9634000	that's the same thing I say about Chrono Trigger and Super Metroid
9634000	9636000	I'm like I'm not saying Chrono Trigger is bad
9636000	9638000	I'm not.
9638000	9640000	In fact it's better than good
9640000	9642000	but it's just
9642000	9644000	Super Metroid is like top tier. It's better than bad
9644000	9646000	it's good? Sure.
9646000	9648000	And I'm gonna say this I've never
9648000	9650000	been in that situation because I
9650000	9652000	mean shit I probably have
9652000	9654000	just about every video game system
9654000	9656000	that's worth owning.
9656000	9658000	I've never been in that situation
9658000	9660000	that I you know
9660000	9662000	now I've had games that
9662000	9664000	like for example Dragon Ball
9664000	9666000	GT Final Battle when I owned that game
9666000	9668000	it was worth a lot of money. I traded it for Blue Stinger
9668000	9670000	I've never regretted it. Even though
9670000	9672000	I can get that game any number of ways
9672000	9674000	now I don't
9674000	9676000	care. It's not that
9676000	9678000	great of a game and I'm totally not into
9678000	9680000	Dragon Ball that much anymore
9680000	9682000	unless I'm like watching the old school stuff.
9682000	9684000	Alright
9684000	9686000	I am gonna try to tackle this email from
9686000	9688000	RossDielUT and I'm gonna shorten it
9688000	9690000	so I apologize to RossDielUT in that
9690000	9692000	regard but it is a very long letter
9692000	9694000	and we're already at 9 o'clock and we gotta wrap up
9694000	9696000	we still have to get calls and wrap the show so
9696000	9698000	Do you think it'd be possible we can allow it to be reposted on the forums?
9698000	9700000	No I would want his permission for that so
9700000	9702000	Why doesn't we ask him to post it on the forum?
9702000	9704000	Yeah so but let me get
9704000	9706000	some of the stuff because first it starts off with
9706000	9708000	a couple paragraphs about the whole Grand Theft Auto 5
9708000	9710000	thing so he says
9710000	9712000	I thought it explained to Loki why the casual
9712000	9714000	sexism, racism, and homo-transphobia in Grand Theft
9714000	9716000	Auto 5 is offensive to people.
9716000	9718000	I firmly agree that not every game needs a female
9718000	9720000	lead. There's plenty of room
9720000	9722000	in the space between lead character and joke
9722000	9724000	character. When a group that you're in is
9724000	9726000	exclusively depicted in an offensive manner
9726000	9728000	that's not going to be fun. Vice City
9728000	9730000	put that into focus for me as a Cuban American
9730000	9732000	who went to school with more than a few Haitian
9732000	9734000	American in his day. The gangs were simply identified
9734000	9736000	by race and all the characters were racist
9736000	9738000	cardboard cutouts. Compare that to games
9738000	9740000	based around the Clancyverse. The main protagonist
9740000	9742000	tends to be a white dude but women and other
9742000	9744000	races are treated with respect and are never
9744000	9746000	relegated to the sidelines.
9746000	9748000	Both GTA and the
9748000	9750000	Clancy games are plainly aimed at
9750000	9752000	the male demographic but the latter does so
9752000	9754000	in a manner that respects minorities and women
9754000	9756000	while the former makes jokes out of them.
9756000	9758000	This isn't to say Rockstar should be forbidden
9758000	9760000	to do what they do. I'm a big proponent of
9760000	9762000	free speech. However that free speech
9762000	9764000	goes both ways and if Rockstar
9764000	9766000	wants to continue to take the cardboard cutout approach
9766000	9768000	to their characters and rely exclusively on
9768000	9770000	negative stereotypes they should be ready to be
9770000	9772000	called out on it. In fact I don't think Rockstar
9772000	9774000	cares as they've been relying on cheap
9774000	9776000	headline-grabbing garbage to sell Grand Theft Auto
9776000	9778000	for years now. Solving the problem
9778000	9780000	might lead to less sales so why stop
9780000	9782000	degrading women and minorities?
9782000	9784000	I think
9784000	9786000	I'm a little
9786000	9788000	bit with you Ross Deal UT until like your last
9788000	9790000	two sentences and the reason for
9790000	9792000	that is that I think you're also kind of dismissing
9792000	9794000	why that quite
9794000	9796000	possibly there are people that are drawn to Grand Theft Auto
9796000	9798000	because it's a good game
9798000	9800000	outside the story. Like I kind of think
9800000	9802000	for Loki, I don't mean to put
9802000	9804000	words in your mouth but I always got the sense
9804000	9806000	you're an open world explorer do your
9806000	9808000	own thing kind of guy. That's what you
9808000	9810000	like out of Grand Theft Auto way more than
9810000	9812000	the story. I would say that there's a lot more
9812000	9814000	depth that's been put in place
9814000	9816000	aside from Vice City
9816000	9818000	what came out in 2002
9818000	9820000	I mean that's
9820000	9822000	you can't judge
9822000	9824000	a game now like Grand Theft Auto
9824000	9826000	5 based on Grand Theft Auto
9826000	9828000	1 or even like
9828000	9830000	some of the games that were in the early
9830000	9832000	3D series
9832000	9834000	3 through Vice City
9834000	9836000	and that kind of stuff. It's just it's so
9836000	9838000	different now that they have a lot more
9838000	9840000	writing involved in the
9840000	9842000	characters. It's not just hey
9842000	9844000	it's this Haitian
9844000	9846000	guy. He's a gang member
9846000	9848000	now and stuff. There's a lot more
9848000	9850000	to it unfortunately
9850000	9852000	so I'm not
9852000	9854000	really going to go with it. Granted
9854000	9856000	some of the earlier games are probably more like that
9856000	9858000	where it's like hey we've got the triads
9858000	9860000	and they're going to act Chinese and oh hey we've got
9860000	9862000	this gang and
9862000	9864000	this nationality because
9864000	9866000	they were limited in what they could do as far as
9866000	9868000	looks and stuff. They couldn't
9868000	9870000	get that many characters that look
9870000	9872000	different. Memory. Also if I
9872000	9874000	may say something he made a point
9874000	9876000	though that is something that I have very
9876000	9878000	recently said to my mother
9878000	9880000	freedom of speech does not mean freedom from consequence
9880000	9882000	and so
9882000	9884000	I'm sure they had
9884000	9886000	to have anticipated some fallout from it.
9886000	9888000	Alrighty.
9888000	9890000	Now the big bulk of the email talks
9890000	9892000	about Steam Machines and
9892000	9894000	kind of a bit of counter points to
9894000	9896000	Steam Machines and he basically says
9896000	9898000	congratulations on being one of the
9898000	9900000	few podcasts that didn't declare the Steam
9900000	9902000	Machine the greatest thing ever and
9902000	9904000	I often find that Steam and Blizzard
9904000	9906000	and Nintendo have a tendency to get away with things
9906000	9908000	that other game companies would be eviscerated for
9908000	9910000	and there's a double
9910000	9912000	standard in gaming media and it sickens
9912000	9914000	me says the email.
9914000	9916000	And then he goes on a great deal to talk about Steam
9916000	9918000	Machine and I'm going to apologize because this is the part I've
9918000	9920000	really got to trim down for time.
9920000	9922000	But basically he says
9922000	9924000	A. People who don't already
9924000	9926000	have PCs are not going to buy a thousand
9926000	9928000	dollar hardware and two hundred dollar yearly upgrades
9928000	9930000	for the privilege of being locked to a single vendor
9930000	9932000	and losing all the portability and
9932000	9934000	control they enjoy on consoles. I think there's
9934000	9936000	a little bit of worry that
9936000	9938000	the Steam Machine is not going to give you the plug and play
9938000	9940000	that PCs essentially give you in the build
9940000	9942000	drone PC world. You don't have that
9942000	9944000	same freedom and I get that.
9944000	9946000	And he kind of draws comparisons
9946000	9948000	to 3DO with that as well.
9948000	9950000	And then he talks
9950000	9952000	about
9952000	9954000	how many games
9954000	9956000	sorry
9956000	9958000	I'm trying to paraphrase
9958000	9960000	this here. It's basically
9960000	9962000	if you're
9962000	9964000	invested in Steam you likely know how to
9964000	9966000	get your PC working on the television
9966000	9968000	which also has the bonus of allowing
9968000	9970000	you to play games from anywhere not just
9970000	9972000	Steam. How many games particularly
9972000	9974000	games that wouldn't be god awful on any
9974000	9976000	kind of controller don't come to consoles
9976000	9978000	anymore. To hear PC gamers
9978000	9980000	tell it much of what comes out on PC nowadays
9980000	9982000	is console ports outside of a few
9982000	9984000	indie outliers in Valve so
9984000	9986000	that's not going to be enough to push people who aren't already
9986000	9988000	in the PC space. Then he goes on
9988000	9990000	to talk about the controller and
9990000	9992000	you know is it really going to have
9992000	9994000	everybody on board to support it
9994000	9996000	and so on.
9996000	9998000	Ownership of the software is another huge
9998000	10000000	point. PC gamers
10000000	10002000	he says have
10002000	10004000	gone to Valve in force but
10004000	10006000	the mainstream market isn't going to spend
10006000	10008000	$60 on title they don't feel like
10008000	10010000	they own. Steam
10010000	10012000	has lots of sales to alleviate that but we're
10012000	10014000	never going to get the point where 99 cent or $5
10014000	10016000	or even $5 to $15 is the
10016000	10018000	norm for new released AAA
10018000	10020000	titles. Activision would laugh Valve
10020000	10022000	reps right out of the office in mere suggestion
10022000	10024000	of devaluing the massive call of duty money
10024000	10026000	machine to get that way. But Activision
10026000	10028000	I think Activision is kind of
10028000	10030000	in the minor well they're not in the minority
10030000	10032000	but they're them take
10032000	10034000	two and
10034000	10036000	EA the big three
10036000	10038000	guys you know they put out some massive
10038000	10040000	titles that are also on PC
10040000	10042000	yeah call of duty it's still
10042000	10044000	$60 on PC and
10044000	10046000	that didn't used to be the case it used to be
10046000	10048000	10 bucks cheaper but they for
10048000	10050000	our call of duty so we can get away with
10050000	10052000	that you know but that's
10052000	10054000	not true for everything like NBA 2K
10054000	10056000	14 is 30 bucks
10056000	10058000	on PC versus
10058000	10060000	60 on console and
10060000	10062000	so and I think
10062000	10064000	you know some of their bigger tiles yeah
10064000	10066000	the price point is the
10066000	10068000	same as console but
10068000	10070000	you know there's also modding support with
10070000	10072000	some of these games there's also
10072000	10074000	you know all the different features they can get on
10074000	10076000	you know PC and plus the
10076000	10078000	PC retail market there's not really a
10078000	10080000	big retail market anymore for PC good luck
10080000	10082000	finding you know
10082000	10084000	the one rack that they have a GameStop
10084000	10086000	or something that has your PC product that's the
10086000	10088000	biggest point I get from this
10088000	10090000	email that I really want to call out and this will be the
10090000	10092000	last thing I say about this email I want to read this one paragraph
10092000	10094000	all this of course ignores
10094000	10096000	the likely fact that these things will almost
10096000	10098000	certainly not be heavily promoted by
10098000	10100000	GameStop or Best Buy at least in
10100000	10102000	a manner other than trade in your steam machine here
10102000	10104000	both of who have very lucrative
10104000	10106000	pre-owned programs that won't that they won't
10106000	10108000	put in jeopardy good luck selling a box
10108000	10110000	with no mainstream appeal at Walmart
10110000	10112000	especially the most mostly disinterested
10112000	10114000	hardware partners who aren't going to make a massive
10114000	10116000	push without software compensation
10116000	10118000	I do get that point
10118000	10120000	and it is a good question to ask
10120000	10122000	who is this for?
10122000	10124000	I don't know that's the thing it's like I don't
10124000	10126000	understand because if they're trying to compete
10126000	10128000	like he does make a point sorry
10128000	10130000	he does make a point the hardcore
10130000	10132000	PC users already figured out how to
10132000	10134000	hook these things up to their TV the
10134000	10136000	casuals aren't going to buy something
10136000	10138000	like this when there's like the consoles
10138000	10140000	and other especially like at a Walmart
10140000	10142000	there's lots like cheaper stuff sitting on the shelves
10142000	10144000	who is this really for?
10144000	10146000	I don't know because you know
10146000	10148000	the thing is
10148000	10150000	if they're going to compete with consoles
10150000	10152000	if they compete with price I mean because this is
10152000	10154000	look at we give at least I
10154000	10156000	give shit to Xbox One for being $100
10156000	10158000	more than the Playstation 4 but
10158000	10160000	fuck a PC with a
10160000	10162000	Titan graphics card
10162000	10164000	it is not going to be anywhere near $500
10164000	10166000	that shit's going to be like $1500
10166000	10168000	alright so
10168000	10170000	to give a counterpoint to
10170000	10172000	Ross Deal's email let me go to our chat room at
10172000	10174000	live.vognetwork.com and I think this is a good way to
10174000	10176000	end it on Dungeon Buster says
10176000	10178000	who says that Valve might decide to
10178000	10180000	go the general retail route at all?
10180000	10182000	and I think that's a good point and
10182000	10184000	maybe something we need to consider that
10184000	10186000	maybe the media
10186000	10188000	gaming media or whatever you want to call it
10188000	10190000	maybe we're making a bigger deal out of this
10190000	10192000	than it really is
10192000	10194000	who knows?
10194000	10196000	alright let's move on
10196000	10198000	lots of email tonight
10198000	10200000	I fully look forward to the origins machine
10200000	10202000	no thanks
10202000	10204000	pass pass
10204000	10206000	alright let's get to the FUs of the week
10206000	10208000	where we get a little angsty on the show
10208000	10210000	because
10220000	10222000	um
10222000	10224000	my FU goes back to
10224000	10226000	the Wasp from last week
10226000	10228000	because the stinger finally came out
10228000	10230000	and my finger hurts a lot less now
10230000	10232000	thankfully
10232000	10234000	also FU to the blisters on the bottoms of my feet
10234000	10236000	that are right up at the top by the toes
10236000	10238000	because I was stupid
10238000	10240000	I take responsibility for this
10240000	10242000	I wore my Vibrams walking on concrete
10242000	10244000	and I hadn't worn them in a long time
10244000	10246000	so I rubbed my foot a little bit off
10246000	10248000	and then FU to
10248000	10250000	Wasabi the restaurant
10250000	10252000	their sushi is normally very very good
10252000	10254000	but they put sriracha damn near everything
10254000	10256000	like
10256000	10258000	thankfully it wasn't touching my food
10258000	10260000	except that I think that there was some in my food
10260000	10262000	I think there was some cross contamination
10262000	10264000	going on because I broke out in hives
10264000	10266000	and my throat swelled
10266000	10268000	and I had to take lots of Benadryl when I got home
10268000	10270000	so and for me
10270000	10272000	my food allergies yeah they're weird
10272000	10274000	but they're easily avoidable
10274000	10276000	so
10276000	10278000	fuck sriracha
10278000	10280000	uh
10280000	10282000	I guess you didn't buy into those sriracha
10282000	10284000	lace chips when they were out either
10284000	10286000	Dan told me that those just tasted like
10286000	10288000	hot ketchup
10288000	10290000	um FU to
10290000	10292000	my head hurting
10292000	10294000	cause I have a
10294000	10296000	I think allergies cause my eyes are burning too
10296000	10298000	I'll just
10298000	10300000	give a quick FU to the stress of putting on
10300000	10302000	a show and directing it
10302000	10304000	as much as I am very proud of the
10304000	10306000	people that are working very hard to do this show
10306000	10308000	and I know it's gonna be great
10308000	10310000	I want my free days back
10310000	10312000	less stress but
10312000	10314000	I've only got six more days to go it will be a kickass show
10314000	10316000	it really will alright um
10316000	10318000	last up Michelle
10318000	10320000	uh I'd like to give an FU to Gina Gershon
10320000	10322000	cause she don't know shit
10322000	10324000	but she does a great
10324000	10326000	Versace keep in mind
10326000	10328000	she is playing Versace in a Lifetime movie
10328000	10330000	just saying
10330000	10332000	alright
10333000	10335000	I can't believe you gave an FU to Gina Gershon
10335000	10337000	I love that woman alright
10337000	10339000	just a couple more stories and then we'll do some quick
10339000	10341000	calls we're running a little long tonight
10341000	10343000	the tech issues earlier put us back
10343000	10345000	so you're not gonna have a lot of
10345000	10347000	time to get through so I will
10347000	10349000	put the call out in just a couple minutes here for calls
10349000	10351000	but first Loki
10351000	10353000	so the OUYA
10353000	10355000	is coming out in European markets
10355000	10357000	is anyone excited
10357000	10359000	I know I'm excited
10359000	10361000	Europe's excited
10362000	10364000	are they who bought your OUYA
10364000	10366000	was it a listener or just some random
10366000	10368000	I think it's a random guy ok that's cool
10368000	10370000	I'm done with it so
10370000	10372000	wash my hands of that
10372000	10374000	so yeah it will be coming out
10374000	10376000	99 euro
10376000	10378000	Germany France Italy
10378000	10380000	Austria Switzerland
10380000	10382000	Spain
10382000	10384000	and it looks like Scandinavia
10384000	10386000	Norway Denmark and
10386000	10388000	oh I guess that's it
10388000	10390000	late October and the
10390000	10392000	distributors I guess Flashpoint and Digital Brothers
10392000	10394000	will be handling the distribution duties
10394000	10396000	in Western Europe while Action and PA
10396000	10398000	will
10398000	10400000	take Eastern Europe
10400000	10402000	so
10402000	10404000	hopefully
10404000	10406000	hopefully
10406000	10408000	the people in Europe will be luckier
10408000	10410000	than the people in the US because
10410000	10412000	OUYA themselves can't handle distribution for shit
10412000	10414000	so handing
10414000	10416000	off to somebody else might be a little bit better
10416000	10418000	and I still wanna know and
10418000	10420000	I'm probably gonna check this right now
10420000	10422000	I wanna know if people still actually
10422000	10424000	haven't gotten their Kickstarter OUYA
10424000	10426000	because I think there were still some people
10426000	10428000	out there that did not have their
10428000	10430000	Kickstarter OUYA
10430000	10432000	that's sad and such
10432000	10434000	alright speaking of sad
10434000	10436000	this guy has
10436000	10438000	definitely left his mark on the video game universe
10438000	10440000	which is funny because he wasn't necessarily
10440000	10442000	a game designer but Tom
10442000	10444000	Clancy passed away this week
10444000	10446000	in Baltimore at age 66
10446000	10448000	and if you didn't know Tom Clancy wrote
10448000	10450000	books he didn't just have his name
10450000	10452000	in video games
10452000	10454000	he was a hell of a writer
10454000	10456000	like Ghost Recon and Splinter Cell and all that
10456000	10458000	but he actually wrote books and obviously
10458000	10460000	these military themed novels
10460000	10462000	went on to be adapted into video games
10462000	10464000	and these games do very well
10464000	10466000	Ghost Recon, Splinter Cell and so forth
10466000	10468000	he ended up co-founding Red Storm
10468000	10470000	Entertainment as a part of this and then
10470000	10472000	Ubisoft bought that in August 2000
10472000	10474000	and that's just been doing the games ever since
10474000	10476000	the latest game Tom Clancy
10476000	10478000	The Division coming out
10478000	10480000	late 2014
10480000	10482000	I imagine these games will still
10482000	10484000	carry his name for a long time to come
10484000	10486000	so rest in peace
10486000	10488000	Tom Clancy that is
10488000	10490000	you know that's too bad but
10490000	10492000	unfortunately
10492000	10494000	as time goes on
10494000	10496000	people that provide
10496000	10498000	our beloved entertainment pass away
10498000	10500000	so take a moment to
10500000	10502000	66 is pretty young
10502000	10504000	that does make it
10504000	10506000	all the more tragic
10510000	10512000	yeah those games are very popular
10512000	10514000	I'm going to be completely honest
10514000	10516000	I'm not going to fake it
10516000	10518000	I don't really play these games myself
10518000	10520000	but I listen to other podcasters that really do
10520000	10522000	enjoy these games and I get why people
10522000	10524000	are really into them
10524000	10526000	I think if you're into that military stuff
10526000	10528000	they are a heck of a lot of fun
10528000	10530000	or at least they sure sound fun
10530000	10532000	that's the thing and hey
10532000	10534000	actually we may be past the opportunity for that
10534000	10536000	never mind that was
10536000	10538000	last month I think Rainbow Six Vegas
10538000	10540000	I remember was part of the free games
10540000	10542000	with live so
10542000	10544000	yeah
10544000	10546000	Halo 3 now
10546000	10548000	because you know I didn't buy
10548000	10550000	that game at launch or anything
10550000	10552000	I know right
10552000	10554000	oh I want to say real quick
10554000	10556000	as I mentioned that I think
10556000	10558000	there might have been some people
10558000	10560000	from the kickstart that still haven't fucking gotten
10560000	10562000	their system yet and they
10562000	10564000	are not too pleased by that
10564000	10566000	gee I wonder why
10566000	10568000	using such colorful language
10568000	10570000	yeah
10570000	10572000	alright

10680000	10682000	it's still going for the next 39
10682000	10684000	days and we've raised
10684000	10686000	$4850
10686000	10688000	oh that is so good that is great
10688000	10690000	because you know what funerals ain't free
10690000	10692000	y'all and that's
10692000	10694000	I mean I can't imagine what this
10694000	10696000	poor girl who
10696000	10698000	just lost her mother in a horrific
10698000	10700000	you know accident has to be
10700000	10702000	going through you know and to even
10702000	10704000	like you know she's trying to pull through this thing herself
10704000	10706000	it's like this is awful
10706000	10708000	so I'm really glad to see the communities there and
10708000	10710000	supporting and putting money where their mouth is
10710000	10712000	so to speak
10712000	10714000	definitely but one good thing
10714000	10716000	is she is home from the hospital and
10716000	10718000	we do have a Facebook page for her
10718000	10720000	facebook.com slash project
10720000	10722000	love Venus she we have a
10722000	10724000	video up of her thanking everybody
10724000	10726000	for what we've done and she's truly
10726000	10728000	appreciative for it
10728000	10730000	that's really great
10730000	10732000	yeah you said there was one other
10732000	10734000	involved in the accident her brother
10734000	10736000	another friend of hers we don't
10736000	10738000	know the status about her though
10738000	10740000	that we don't know oh gosh okay
10740000	10742000	yeah wow
10742000	10744000	it's just I'm just happy
10744000	10746000	that even though
10746000	10748000	it just happened within the cosplay community
10748000	10750000	we have people who are connected to
10750000	10752000	the cosplay community anime furry
10752000	10754000	gaming tabletop
10754000	10756000	just running it around
10756000	10758000	like a telephone just spreading the word
10758000	10760000	coming together
10760000	10762000	as one giant family
10762000	10764000	to help one of our own
10764000	10766000	and Atlanta is the place for that to happen
10766000	10768000	too I saw that at Dragon Con
10768000	10770000	with everybody coming together and so
10770000	10772000	I'm sure anime weekend Atlanta
10772000	10774000	is probably just the cool down convention
10774000	10776000	from Dragon Con in some way I shouldn't say
10776000	10778000	that that might be offensive to some but
10778000	10780000	I don't mean it to be whatsoever
10780000	10782000	because I think I had such a blast
10782000	10784000	at Dragon Con I'm sure
10784000	10786000	Atlanta puts on some great stuff
10786000	10788000	I'll give you a hint this is how you know
10788000	10790000	this is your cool down con if you're at
10790000	10792000	the convention you find yourself drinking
10792000	10794000	more than anything else
10794000	10796000	that's your cool down con
10796000	10798000	I like that
10798000	10800000	we did a lot of that at Fonomy though
10800000	10802000	yup
10802000	10804000	I remember trying to find the one vending
10804000	10806000	machine that actually had soda
10806000	10808000	that wasn't horribly expensive
10808000	10810000	and you were ready to attack you were
10810000	10812000	ready to jump over that counter at that
10812000	10814000	woman who couldn't serve us alcohol
10814000	10816000	because it was clothes or something like that
10816000	10818000	thank god for Pineapple Malibu

10898000	10900000	it got bumped with the whole hiccup
10900000	10902000	we had during part A where
10902000	10904000	our radio provider just
10904000	10906000	took a crap
10906000	10908000	or something I don't know anyway
10908000	10910000	weirdness but we do have another call coming
10910000	10912000	in so let's go to it hello you're on OrangeLoungeRadio
10912000	10914000	who's this? Legend Zaku here
10914000	10916000	hey haven't heard from you in a while how you doing
10916000	10918000	Zaku? I'm doing fine
10918000	10920000	yeah I've been at my girl's place for
10920000	10922000	a few weekends now but
10922000	10924000	other than that it's yeah
10924000	10926000	I've been missing out on O.L.R. so I'm
10926000	10928000	playing catch up while she's in Europe for
10928000	10930000	a few weeks alright well I suppose
10930000	10932000	we can forgive
10932000	10934000	this one time but what's on your mind?
10934000	10936000	nothing much just
10936000	10938000	trying to order on GTA V
10938000	10940000	as much as I can
10940000	10942000	it's been pretty much the center piece of my
10942000	10944000	gaming life for
10944000	10946000	the past few weeks now
10946000	10948000	so what is it about this game that just makes you
10948000	10950000	so crazy about it?
10950000	10952000	Trevor I'm not going to spoil it
10952000	10954000	but just that character alone
10954000	10956000	I see Loki smiling
10956000	10958000	over there so you get it
10958000	10960000	mmhmm
10960000	10962000	and I probably haven't
10962000	10964000	even gotten through half the game
10964000	10966000	and already he's already
10966000	10968000	he's already proven to be the
10968000	10970000	you know the
10970000	10972000	batshit insane one
10972000	10974000	otherwise the others are just as
10974000	10976000	fucked up you know like Michael
10976000	10978000	and Franklin but yeah
10978000	10980000	that's what I've
10980000	10982000	been doing so far and
10982000	10984000	you know trying to get myself
10984000	10986000	in that steam machine beta
10986000	10988000	I think a lot of people are with you there
10988000	10990000	good luck though I hope
10990000	10992000	somebody in the O.L.R. gets one
10992000	10994000	and please give us the exclusive
10994000	10996000	hearts
10996000	10998000	yeah I know I mean it took a while
10998000	11000000	all I had to do was just like the last thing I had to do
11000000	11002000	was play something with the controller
11002000	11004000	which I was able to do
11004000	11006000	a few days ago but other than that
11006000	11008000	I'm already in
11008000	11010000	what was I going to say
11010000	11012000	what
11012000	11014000	about Grand Theft Auto 5 online
11014000	11016000	have you been dipping into that at all?
11016000	11018000	haven't done that yet
11018000	11020000	I guess I've made it a personal
11020000	11022000	mission of mine to just
11022000	11024000	wait it out as much as possible
11024000	11026000	instead of having to deal with the disappointment
11026000	11028000	of not getting in and speaking
11028000	11030000	of which have you guys
11030000	11032000	thought about creating a crew for
11032000	11034000	O.L.R. in the social club?
11034000	11036000	that's already happened
11036000	11038000	you might have missed Loki giving it a shout out in part A
11038000	11040000	but one more time Loki how can they find the
11040000	11042000	VoG community club?
11042000	11044000	if you go to
11044000	11046000	the rockstar social club
11046000	11048000	which I believe is socialclub.rockstar.com
11048000	11050000	and then you can
11050000	11052000	go to I think it's slash cruise
11052000	11054000	slash VoG network
11054000	11056000	would be how you would
11056000	11058000	get to it
11058000	11060000	socialclub.rockstargames.com
11060000	11062000	slash cruise slash VoG network
11062000	11064000	and the other option
11064000	11066000	would be to also go into our forums
11066000	11068000	and we have a link there too
11068000	11070000	I see
11070000	11072000	I guess I'll
11072000	11074000	end up trying that and hopefully
11074000	11076000	it won't be as
11076000	11078000	try to shoot Loki a bunch for me
11078000	11080000	since I don't know when I'll get in there
11080000	11082000	I mean
11082000	11084000	you gotta give rockstar credit
11084000	11086000	given the fact that they're doing their best to try to
11086000	11088000	you know, lurch this thing forward
11088000	11090000	as much as possible without any false starts
11090000	11092000	but then again it's like a bad
11092000	11094000	week to be an IT
11094000	11096000	grunt
11096000	11098000	if it's not Grand Theft Auto online
11098000	11100000	it's the health exchanges basically
11100000	11102000	not being up
11102000	11104000	so it's basically
11104000	11106000	all around, there's demand for just about
11106000	11108000	everything. The woes of being
11108000	11110000	popular on the internet. That is
11110000	11112000	true. Alright Zaku
11112000	11114000	I gotta let you go, we gotta go wrap up
11114000	11116000	but thank you so much for the call buddy
11116000	11118000	take care, have fun shooting
11118000	11120000	people in Grand Theft Auto
11120000	11122000	yeah, will do
11122000	11124000	stay good
11124000	11126000	sadly guys I am going to close up the skyline
11126000	11128000	I am so sorry, I know there were more trying to get through
11128000	11130000	but we are almost to
11130000	11132000	9.30 our time which for us is really late
11132000	11134000	I do want to just encourage you
11134000	11136000	if you do have something to say
11136000	11138000	Twitter is a great place to do that
11138000	11140000	twitter.com slash o-l-r or you can also email us
11140000	11142000	mailbag at orange lounge radio
11142000	11144000	dot com and Dark Zakra
11144000	11146000	loves to read your emails
11146000	11148000	speaking of
11148000	11150000	tweets, I wanted to read a couple just
11150000	11152000	real quick here, Tiger Claw
11152000	11154000	sent us a couple, we talked about the offline
11154000	11156000	SimCity one earlier so let me do this one
11156000	11158000	which is Activision Blizzard
11158000	11160000	turning the patent battle up
11160000	11162000	a notch, I didn't even know there was
11162000	11164000	a thing going on there with that
11164000	11166000	trying to bring it up here
11166000	11168000	let's see, this is when they got
11168000	11170000	sued over worlds inc on an online
11170000	11172000	game patent, Activision Blizzard is
11172000	11174000	suing back over different online
11174000	11176000	game patents
11176000	11178000	so essentially
11178000	11180000	what is the worlds game that was
11180000	11182000	worlds player software was
11182000	11184000	a toolkit for creating 3D
11184000	11186000	multiplayer online worlds
11186000	11188000	this goes all the way back to
11188000	11190000	2008 when worlds did a lawsuit
11190000	11192000	against NCSoft claiming
11192000	11194000	City of Heroes violated its
11194000	11196000	virtual space patent, it was
11196000	11198000	dismissed after the two companies settled
11198000	11200000	but it looks like Activision Blizzard
11200000	11202000	not going to settle anytime
11202000	11204000	soon and they are taking these patent guys
11204000	11206000	to court
11206000	11208000	I hope they can get that all sorted out
11208000	11210000	I think patent laws need to be re-examined
11210000	11212000	in this country myself because we hear a lot
11212000	11214000	about these patent messes all the time
11214000	11216000	but that's just me and that's probably
11216000	11218000	for another week, there's a lot of shit in this country
11218000	11220000	that needs to be fixed
11220000	11222000	but unfortunately we're out of time
11222000	11224000	Chell, I want to thank you so much for being here
11224000	11226000	tonight, thank you, I know you didn't get to
11226000	11228000	say a lot a lot outside but the
11228000	11230000	stuff you did say, I had to fist bump you several
11230000	11232000	times tonight so thank you for
11232000	11234000	your viewpoint tonight and
11234000	11236000	please come back again sometime soon
11236000	11238000	Thank you so much for having me and as soon as I can
11238000	11240000	Alright, anything you want to plug
11240000	11242000	even if that's your friend's game again or
11242000	11244000	what have you? I kind of want to plug
11244000	11246000	another game too, it's
11246000	11248000	also an indie game, forgot to plug it earlier
11248000	11250000	it doesn't have a demo out
11250000	11252000	yet but once it does I am downloading
11252000	11254000	that shit, it's called Coral Cove
11254000	11256000	completely traditional art

11270000	11272000	alright, last
11272000	11274000	but not least, we go around and we get the final thoughts
11274000	11276000	I do want to say real quick though
11276000	11278000	before we get the final thoughts, thank you guys
11278000	11280000	so much for listening to our program

11288000	11290000	your support means the world
11290000	11292000	all we ask if you do enjoy what you hear here at
11292000	11294000	Orange Launch Radio, tell a friend or two or five
11294000	11296000	about the show, and yeah
11296000	11298000	help spread the word about Orange Launch Radio
11298000	11300000	and we will grow our family even more
11300000	11302000	don't forget about the Podcast Awards
11302000	11304000	thing too, just again for your consideration
11304000	11306000	we would love it if you'd take the
11306000	11308000	15 seconds to go to PodcastAwards.com
11308000	11310000	and nominate us for People's Choice
11310000	11312000	and Best Gaming, but even if you
11312000	11314000	don't choose to nominate us
11314000	11316000	be sure to keep it independent
11316000	11318000	because the commercial guys
11318000	11320000	don't need the additional exposure
11320000	11322000	they already have plenty of money
11322000	11324000	let's go around and get everybody's
11324000	11326000	final thought, I guess I should start with our guest
11326000	11328000	Chell, do you have any final thoughts tonight?
11328000	11330000	It is weird
11330000	11332000	not having anybody come on me
11332000	11334000	I had
11334000	11336000	to do the last Showgirls reference
11336000	11338000	you know I had to
11338000	11340000	I like you a lot
11340000	11342000	even if that quote's gonna get you into trouble
11342000	11344000	Alright, Dark Sakura
11344000	11346000	I don't know how you're gonna follow that, but good luck
11346000	11348000	what's your final thought?
11348000	11350000	I'm very irritated that
11350000	11352000	Homestuck just updated and everybody
11352000	11354000	is on the page and now it's 503-ing
11354000	11356000	because I wanna know what the fuck
11356000	11358000	happens because it was like a
11358000	11360000	20 page update. God dammit
11360000	11362000	hussy. Alright
11362000	11364000	and my final thought is
11364000	11366000	Chell, maybe you could do my
11366000	11368000	nails sometime
11368000	11370000	then again I'm getting a little too old
11370000	11372000	for that hoary look
11372000	11374000	Loki
11374000	11376000	your final thought
11376000	11378000	I'm disappointed that I missed the leaked
11378000	11380000	Godzilla trailer. What?
11380000	11382000	They're making a new Godzilla?
11382000	11384000	Didn't you know? It's been all over Tumblr
11384000	11386000	It's like a Matthew Broderick one, I remember that
11386000	11388000	No, this one's the French President
11388000	11390000	Oh, really?
11390000	11392000	Interesting, alright, well, have to check that out
11392000	11394000	Who thinks Matthew Broderick?
11396000	11398000	He's Godzilla
11398000	11400000	What happened to my career?
11402000	11404000	Good things apparently
11404000	11406000	Oh, Matthew Broderick, yeah
11406000	11408000	Oh, yeah, no, the other guy did Breaking Bad
11408000	11410000	and all that, yeah, but
11410000	11412000	What happened to my career? I'm making tons of money
11412000	11414000	Matthew Broderick, well, I think he went to stage
11414000	11416000	I think he's done a lot with stage
11416000	11418000	Election was one of my favorite movies ever
11418000	11420000	That was like 13 years ago
11420000	11422000	The Producers
11422000	11424000	Yeah, that's true, that's why I think he's done more like stage type of stuff
11424000	11426000	Alright, there we go
11426000	11428000	There we go, that's it
11428000	11430000	Thank you again for tuning into the show
11430000	11432000	Have fun with your games, people
11432000	11434000	And we will see you next time
