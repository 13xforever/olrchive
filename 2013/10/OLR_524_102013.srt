Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
This week, Square Enix announced one old and one new Kingdom Hearts game

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
A former would-be dancing game slips down and seeks a modern revival

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
And the creators of Missing Riven announce their latest adventure game

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Everything old is new again on tonight's episode which begins right now

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Orange Lounge Radio

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Where every gamer has a voice, it is Orange Lounge Radio

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
For this, episode number 524, October the 20th of 2013

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
My name is Rob Roberts, here to talk with you about the latest and greatest in the video gaming world

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
With my co-hosts, first off, say hello to DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I have the coffee jitters

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
A coffee jitter? What is the coffee jitters?

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I had, granted it was decaf, but I still had a venti americano before I came over

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
And then I had coffee just now, and I've had lamb

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Now you want another?

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
No, I'm good

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
You don't want any more coffee?

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I thought that's how you fix the coffee jitters, more coffee?

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
No, I'm actually quite good

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Alright, are you sure you're not going to be driving home?

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
And then, Dan, coffee!

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I've got coffee at home if it comes to that

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
An old OLR in-joke for those that don't know

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Rob!

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
We have a few of those here, we have been doing this show for quite a long time

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Our longest running inside joke, say hello everybody to tech master Loki

29
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Hi

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
How you doing, Loki?

31
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I'm doing fine

32
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm just kidding, I just didn't have any other good transition

33
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
How have you been?

34
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Um, okay

35
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Yeah? Anything new and exciting going on?

36
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
What's your latest project you've been working on?

37
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
You are, after all, the man of many projects

38
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Um, well, let's see

39
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I'm still trying to work on finishing up

40
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Actually, that's what I'm doing right now

41
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I'm looking for a 12 volt battery

42
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Um, just that separate screen thing

43
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
The, uh, wireless second screen for, like, the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360

44
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Oh, right, you talked about that a couple weeks back

45
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
How's that going?

46
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Oh, it's going alright

47
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I've just been running a little low on money

48
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
So I've been kind of holding off

49
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Just because, um, also I'm trying to find the right battery for it

50
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Because I want to find something that's not too expensive

51
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
And I don't really want to ship anything from China

52
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Because it's going to take a long time to get here

53
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
So I'm just trying to find something that's got somewhat decent battery life

54
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
And, I don't know

55
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I took apart my wireless HDMI receiver the other day

56
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
And thankfully, it's actually, the board inside it's a lot smaller than I thought it would be

57
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
And they have, like, a daughter board on there as well

58
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
So it's going to be easy to take apart

59
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
And then, uh, I don't know

60
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Once you get this second screen project of yours finished

61
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
What's the first thing you're going to do with it?

62
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Like, what's the first game you're going to play with it?

63
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Grand Theft Auto 5, of course

64
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Because, you know, that tells me what's the whole point of this project

65
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Grand Theft Auto 5

66
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
But here's the thing, though, is I don't really need it anymore

67
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Because I have a setup in my living room where I have my office chair there

68
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
And my computer monitor, since I don't really have a computer on

69
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
So I actually play Grand Theft Auto on that

70
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Um, so, technically I don't really need it anymore

71
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Because I still have a screen to play it on

72
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
While my wife watches TV

73
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
But I'm still going to build it

74
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
That's fair, because it's a thing

75
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
It's become a thing

76
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
And now you have to see it through to completion

77
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I had to prototype something this week

78
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Uh, that it's some thing that they're planning on trying to sell or something

79
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:43,000
It's like, uh, some little figure with, like, a USB, like, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth adapters built into it

80
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
And a thumb drive or something

81
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
So I got to play with that this week

82
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
But, yeah, I do want to make this the thing

83
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Um, I got to do

84
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
After I figure, well, after I get all the parts

85
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
So really only parts I have left are the battery

86
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
And probably a 12 volt step down to 5 volt

87
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Um, and then some miscellaneous ports and wires

88
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
And then once that's all done

89
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
And I figure out how I want to, uh, be laid out

90
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I have to get the wood to build a mold

91
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Or, yeah, sort of, I guess, a mold for, um, vacuum for me

92
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
And then I have to build the vacuum for me rig

93
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Which, that's easy, because that's just a box, so

94
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Oh my gosh, alright

95
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Uh, let's go to our chat room

96
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000

104
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Wanting to know in chat

105
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
What baconified food product

106
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Did Loki bring to the OLR studio tonight

107
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
If it's your first time ever listening to OLR

108
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Uh, hi and welcome

109
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
And thanks for checking us out, first off

110
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Second off, Loki's pretty notorious

111
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
For bringing a variety of different

112
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Fast food, slow food, whatever food

113
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I mean, Dark Soccer

114
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Pretty reliably brings a salad

115
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
But Loki can bring a lot of different things

116
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I don't bring a salad reliably

117
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I used to when

118
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I bring a lot more meat these days

119
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Alright, meat salad

120
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I didn't bring anything with bacon on it

121
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Just because I wasn't that hungry

122
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
And so I just kinda got

123
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
It's a two cheeseburger meal from McDonald's

124
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Cause it's cheap, I didn't really need to eat anything

125
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
But I know, cause last time

126
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I skipped dinner, I was just like

127
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Oh, I'm not hungry, I'm gonna skip dinner

128
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
And then like when I got home at like 10 o'clock I was hungry

129
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
So I just, I got something

130
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Something kinda small

131
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Cause I don't really like going to McDonald's

132
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
In the evening cause their fries are stale

133
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
And yeah, their fries were stale again

134
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I ate them anyways, but they were stale

135
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
And I'm not, not enjoying that

136
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
And their burgers weren't even that good either

137
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
So it was just kinda eating just to be full

138
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
That's pretty much it

139
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I'd love to see you bring some In-N-Out

140
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
But, I, okay, I would

141
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
But to reliably get here on time with

142
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
In-N-Out, it's just a crap shoot cause I can't tell

143
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
How busy they're gonna be and

144
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Sometimes it's like 30 minutes to get out of there

145
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
So, um

146
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Yeah, I just didn't do that

147
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Although I did eat just bacon the other day

148
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
For lunch, that's all I had was bacon

149
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
So, I guess that counts

150
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
And so I ran out of bacon

151
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Cause we had to eat the whole package before it was gone

152
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
My wife says, well you ate all the bacon

153
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I'm like, dude, I only had like three pieces

154
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
So, you ate all the bacon

155
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
That's right

156
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Um, you know, your weakness

157
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
For bacon is like my weakness for pumpkin

158
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
And this is the time of year, let me tell you

159
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Uh, oh, you're shaking your head

160
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
That's right, you don't like the pumpkin stuff, huh?

161
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Went to Trader Joe's the other day, Alan and I loaded up

162
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
On all this pumpkin stuff, like pumpkin butter

163
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Pumpkin bread mix, pumpkin

164
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
And, um, pumpkin macaroons

165
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I saw those in the, it's

166
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
What? Yeah, oh yeah, you wanna try one?

167
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I need to read the label

168
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Oh wait, yeah, you're on a diet, nevermind

169
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I should be encouraging

170
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Let me read the label to see if it's good

171
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Okay, go check the freezer

172
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Burger King is better than McDonald's

173
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Yes, I 100% agree

174
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Unfortunately there is like four McDonald's on the way here

175
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
And one Burger King

176
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
And I just don't feel like stopping off the freeway

177
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
To stop at the Burger King

178
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
If the McDonald's by me was a Burger King

179
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I'd be stopping at Burger King

180
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Because I like Burger King way better than McDonald's

181
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Just FYI, I'd be able to have one

182
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
If I wasn't so close already to my limit, so

183
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Aw, next week

184
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
If they're not gone

185
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Alright, you can do it

186
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Alright, uh, let's see

187
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I had a kickoff topic for tonight

188
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I don't know how successful this will be

189
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
But I was thinking, you know, we're getting into the Halloween

190
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Season like full swing now

191
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
And, uh, I don't know about you guys

192
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I'm not seeing as many like

193
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Costume stores this year

194
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Last year seemed like there was one on every corner

195
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
This year I'm not seeing as many

196
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
No, I'm not seeing as many

197
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Maybe it's just the normal locations I see them at

198
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I've seen quite a few

199
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Well, I thought I would ask

200
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
What good video game costumes

201
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
You might be seeing out there

202
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Are you seeing anything gaming inspired

203
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
And what types of great

204
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Gaming costumes have you seen in the past

205
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
But this is a tricky subject

206
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Because my mind always goes to these great

207
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Gaming cosplays I've seen before

208
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Which technically is a little different than Halloween

209
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Yeah, it's just Halloween is the day that cosplay is

210
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Cosplay is Halloween for grown ups every day

211
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Or every other weekend, really

212
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
See, the difference between cosplay

213
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
And Halloween is

214
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Halloween you get candy

215
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Cosplay you get sexually assaulted

216
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I shouldn't laugh at that

217
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
But sadly it's true

218
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Alright, um

219
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
So what kind of like good costumes

220
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Have you guys been seeing

221
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I find it interesting how Mario and Luigi

222
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Have really kind of, you know

223
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Gone into the mainstream

224
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Well, I mean it really shouldn't be a surprise

225
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Those games are obviously like landmark games

226
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Like common that costume is now these days

227
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
When I remember growing up

228
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Like if you were to dress up like Mario

229
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Like nobody knew who you were

230
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
But it's kind of interesting that like now it's like so commonplace

231
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
A lot of like people dress their kids up as that

232
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Um, act deaf in our chatroom

233
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
At live.vognetwork.com

234
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Remembering Loki's Sackboy costume

235
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I still have the head, I don't know where the bottom is

236
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Though, but I still have the head

237
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Yeah, you wore that to one of the anniversary shows

238
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Or something right, that was good times

239
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Was it 300 or 400, one of them

240
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Good times

241
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
You know what I realized I still have

242
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
My organization 13 coat

243
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
So, I don't know

244
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
It was me and

245
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Kristen and Megzi

246
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
We all went as our OC's

247
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Our organization 13 OC's

248
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Which was pretty fun

249
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I do remember at Disneyland seeing a child

250
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Dressed up as Sora and I was like

251
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
You have the coolest parents ever because

252
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Like you don't see any Kingdom Hearts related stuff

253
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
At Disneyland anymore, which is really sad

254
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Except for the pins

255
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I guess now, I think there's one or two now

256
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
But yeah, probably just because

257
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
You're starting to see more and more Kingdom Hearts

258
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
With the game, you know, really releases

259
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
And leading up to three and so forth

260
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I know that there's the

261
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Organization 13 Mickey

262
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
And then there's one other that I haven't been able to find

263
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Yeah, I've seen the Organization 13 Mickey

264
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
But, be interesting

265
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
It's never gonna happen, Regent Air

266
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
What's Regent Air saying? Loki's Tingle costume?

267
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
No, I think that's a lost cause

268
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
We gave up on that

269
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Now don't get me wrong, I have the build for that

270
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
But it's just not gonna happen

271
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I just don't want to buy that much spandex

272
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
What's your kid going as this year?

273
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Are you doing anything gaming?

274
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
He's a firework

275
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Oh wait, that's right, you mentioned that on a previous episode

276
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Yeah, my sister is building the costume for that

277
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Although, I'm wondering though

278
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
If they're not gonna know what he is

279
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Because the

280
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Costume kind of looks like a black t-shirt

281
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
With garland wrapped around it

282
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
And then he's gonna have a hat with

283
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Kind of

284
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I don't know what you'd call it

285
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Not garland

286
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
But kind of the stars and stuff

287
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Popping off of it

288
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Not really streamers, but they have the stiff

289
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Wire

290
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Not really garland, but decoration stuff

291
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Where the stars and things

292
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Like those things you get at the dollar store

293
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Yeah, I've seen wrapped in gifts and stuff

294
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Yeah, stuff you would kind of picture

295
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
4th of July

296
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
He's gonna have that

297
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
You should have stars and stripes

298
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Forever playing wherever he walks

299
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
That's what he's gonna do

300
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I'm not doing a costume this year

301
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Just because

302
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I'm just not feeling it

303
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I don't have anyone to dress up with

304
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
It's because they had to go and lay off all my friends

305
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
That's my boss

306
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Cool, I get to hang out with my boss

307
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
No, I'm just not gonna do anything

308
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I just don't care

309
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
This Halloween, it's weird

310
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
It's the first Halloween I've had in a while

311
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Where I don't have something with Rocky or a picture show going on

312
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Because that all finished up weeks early this year

313
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
So I don't really have anything this year

314
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I did get invited to a party

315
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
That's right after Halloween

316
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
That's still a dress up party

317
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Something that Captain Spike

318
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Is doing

319
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
The theme is around internet memes

320
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
That sounds awesome

321
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I know what I'm doing

322
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
But I'm not gonna say because I know Captain Spike

323
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Does this occasionally so I don't wanna spoil it

324
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Because it's gotta be a surprise

325
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I'll take you guys off air because I think you guys

326
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Get a kick out of it

327
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Let's see, go into our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com

328
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
BobbyBlackWolf says

329
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
A vog starter

330
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Buy the spandex for Loki

331
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I'm not

332
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
You're gonna need a lot of money

333
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
No, don't buy spandex

334
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
For Loki

335
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
No offense

336
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I think the world would be a better place

337
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
But then we can get the glamour shots

338
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Come on

339
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Let's see, codeband

340
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
In our chatroom says

341
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Trying to convince my wife to let me dress our daughter up

342
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
As a white mage

343
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Oh I saw the pictures of the concept stuff

344
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
That would be pretty awesome

345
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
That's adorable

346
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
A little baby white mage

347
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Well not baby but toddler white mage

348
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
It's pretty cute

349
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I'm sure this is something that they have

350
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
A white mage hoodie

351
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
You have a white

352
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Plain hoodie thing and then you put the

353
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Fringe on it

354
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I don't know how

355
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Convincing it would look but something like that

356
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Alright

357
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
It really

358
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Actually wouldn't be that hard because

359
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
To do one of the concepts of a white mage

360
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Your basic robe would be

361
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
A pretty big circle skirt

362
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
With sleeves sewn on

363
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
And then just a hoodie top

364
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
It really would be that easy

365
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I didn't have a pattern for one that I was going to do

366
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
As a cosplay eventually

367
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
But never did

368
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
It doesn't seem like it depends what kind of white mage

369
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
You're going for

370
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
It wouldn't be too difficult

371
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
If you're trying to go as Yuna that might be a little trickier

372
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Because you have to get the right colors and all that

373
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
And you also have to be

374
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Anorexic

375
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
She's also not a white mage

376
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
She's a summoner

377
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
She's summoner slash white mage

378
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
If you were going to be a white mage then you would have to be

379
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Oh yeah yeah

380
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Alright

381
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Or that bitch face Aerith

382
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Let's get into

383
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
How was your gaming week and the types of video games

384
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
That you've been playing this week

385
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Dark Sakura what have you been up to?

386
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I played more fractal

387
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
It's just my chill out kind of game

388
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
So I love it

389
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I'm playing more Bejeweled

390
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I actually broke a million points twice

391
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
On one of the modes

392
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Which is actually kind of difficult

393
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I played Final Fantasy 14

394
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Which I am at

395
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
The Bukake Manor

396
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Or was it Hauke

397
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Hauke Manor yeah

398
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
And so I need help

399
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Doing that one eventually

400
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
And what else did I play

401
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I actually played

402
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Mass Effect 2

403
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Because Becky

404
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Has this thing for me using the high res mod

405
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Well not really doing the high res mod

406
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
But I do the high res mod anyway

407
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
To take screen caps for her

408
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Of her shepherd

409
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
So that she can have pretty pictures

410
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
So that's what I did

411
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
And then I'm actually playing through

412
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I'm trying to finish my game on three

413
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Just because I'm like I should finish it

414
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
But that and I need more screen cap fodder

415
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Because I'm really

416
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Really really really running out of ideas

417
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
For my stupid caption

418
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Bullshit

419
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
And yes

420
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Bitch face Aerith

421
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
That was from our chat room

422
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
And I do not name Aerith bitch face

423
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I name her Aerith with a T H

424
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
But she's still bitch face in my esteem

425
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I played something

426
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Animal Crossing

427
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
And I feel bad because I was going to open my village tonight

428
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
And I left it at home

429
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
So sorry

430
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I have three characters in my village now

431
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I have Sakura, I have Tsubasa

432
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Who I made just for the sole purpose of redecoration

433
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
And making Ed move

434
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Because Ed's fucking creepy

435
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Did it work?

436
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
No, he's still fucking there, the shit

437
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
And I made a character for Julian

438
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
For Becky's son

439
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Oh nice

440
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I may have mentioned this before

441
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
He sits with me when I play the game over there

442
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
And he practices his reading

443
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
With Animal Crossing

444
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
So I have to, you know, skip past kitty fuck

445
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
And, you know, poot

446
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Well, poot's okay

447
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
But I have to skip past the one that says pussy

448
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
The naughty language

449
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Fuck and all that

450
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
So, um

451
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
He used to laugh his head off at

452
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Pork Sword and he had no idea

453
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Oh wow

454
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
And I can't

455
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Take credit for that one, that actually came from

456
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
One of Queen Semiya's characters that moved into my village

457
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
That was hilarious

458
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
So yeah, lots of Animal Crossing

459
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
And, um

460
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Dan

461
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Busted out the Ness

462
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
And played Kickle Cubicle

463
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Kickle Cubicle

464
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
It's just the way you say kickle that makes it

465
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Sort of come out the other way

466
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I remember that game

467
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
So now that we have the Ness hooked up

468
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I'm actually gonna be playing

469
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I'm thinking about trying to rebuild my skills in Guardian Legend

470
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Nothing wrong with that

471
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I am going to be in tears for the next month

472
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Until I remember how to play that damn game

473
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Because that game's fucking hard

474
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
It is hard, but it's such a good reward

475
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I've beaten that game so many times when I was like

476
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
13

477
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
There you go

478
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Alright, Loki, how was your gaming week?

479
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I just played Grand Theft Auto 5

480
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Of course, that's all I played

481
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
But we had our fog game nights

482
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Yeah, I was hearing some good stuff about that on Twitter, how'd that go?

483
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Well, the first night

484
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
When I was doing PS3

485
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I was trying to do video capture

486
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
And I have the Elgato capture thing

487
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
But for some damn reason it would not

488
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Pick up the Playstation 3

489
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Even through the component cables

490
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Which is weird though, because I thought I had another set of component cables

491
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Maybe I'm just doing it wrong or something

492
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I thought I had one that was

493
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
The Playstation, actually

494
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
The multi-AV input

495
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
It was just that to

496
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
The Elgato

497
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I can't find that, so I used

498
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
The component thing

499
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
That did not work out at all

500
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
It just could not detect it for some reason

501
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
But it was being finicky

502
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Even with my Xbox 360 is doing the same

503
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Kind of bullshit

504
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Kind of skipped capturing that stuff

505
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
It's okay though, because we only had about

506
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Two people I think the first night

507
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Then on

508
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Friday we did the second

509
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Game night, which was on the

510
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Xbox 360 version of Grand Theft Auto Online

511
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
That was a great turn out, we had about four or five people

512
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Including Bobby

513
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
And we basically

514
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Bobby didn't want to do any death matches

515
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
So we just did races

516
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
And parachute drops

517
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
And then

518
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
The one I think I had the most fun with

519
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Was Top Fun

520
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
And Top Fun is basically

521
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
It's a team game

522
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
One team is in jets

523
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
And the other team is in cars

524
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Cars are motorcycles usually

525
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
And they have to get from one point

526
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
To another point on the map

527
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Without getting killed by the people in the jets

528
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
And it was a pretty

529
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Intense gameplay

530
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
There was one where we had some other people join in with us

531
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
And we had all died

532
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
And then we were just watching this guy

533
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Just haul ass through

534
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
The entire

535
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Los Santos area

536
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
And there was this one where he hit a jump

537
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Somehow and dodged two missiles

538
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
And thankfully I had the foresight

539
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
To capture everything

540
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
So I have that all recorded and I'll be cutting

541
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
A highlight reel

542
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
The only thing that kind of sucks is I didn't manage to record

543
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
My voice when I'm talking over voice chat

544
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
So you hear a lot of one sided conversations

545
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
But

546
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Next time we'll be prepared for that

547
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
4 hours of stuff I have to cut through

548
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
So are you going to do it again next week?

549
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Or is this a one to one thing or what?

550
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
It may not be next week but maybe in a couple weeks

551
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
We'll do it again

552
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I don't know

553
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I had a lot of fun

554
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I think we leveled up about 5 levels

555
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Just playing that

556
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
It was great

557
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
It's hard though because I know

558
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
People on the east coast and stuff

559
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
It's really late and Bobby goes up to 3 in the morning

560
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Because we played until almost midnight

561
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
He's always up that late though

562
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
He runs on west coast time

563
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Even though he's over there in Atlanta

564
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
So I'm going to try to do it again

565
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Because I'm really limited in my window

566
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Of time

567
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
To actually play

568
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Because I have to wait for my son to go to sleep

569
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
But yeah I'll definitely do it again

570
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
But yeah it was a lot of fun

571
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Aside from playing Grand Theft Auto online

572
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Those couple times

573
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I also did play some of the single player

574
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Almost 86% done

575
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
With my 100%

576
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Storyline stuff

577
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
I did the rest of the missions I had left

578
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
And I did all of the

579
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Well some more of the

580
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
What was it?

581
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Off road races

582
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
And assassination missions

583
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
And then some of the

584
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Tonya

585
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Towing missions

586
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
But the last one she has isn't triggered yet

587
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
That's the only thing I'm waiting on

588
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
To get all my strangers and freaks stuff done

589
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
But yeah it's been a lot of fun

590
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
And I'm trying to get the 100%

591
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
So I can start doing that chili ad mystery stuff

592
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
And

593
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I'll definitely be playing more online

594
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Especially more on 360

595
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Because my co-workers flaked on me

596
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I had one of my co-workers up here

597
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
On the Thursday night game

598
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
So we played but

599
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I was the only one that had a headset that day

600
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
So that was kind of difficult to get people together

601
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
And he didn't really know how to join games

602
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
So it was kind of

603
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Unorganized

604
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
But maybe the next time it'll be a little bit better

605
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
When we have more people playing

606
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
But yeah the one

607
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Major gripe I have with

608
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Grand Theft Auto online is just that

609
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
You know if you're getting dumped

610
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Back into the main world again

611
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Unless you're doing what we did throughout most of it

612
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Where we just went from job to job to job to job

613
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
You get all

614
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Split up

615
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
You get to constantly re-invite people back into your game

616
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Just to keep everyone in the same world

617
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
But we had a lot of fun

618
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
So definitely looking forward to doing that again soon

619
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Alright

620
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Well be sure to let us all know when the next

621
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Game night is for Grand Theft Auto

622
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
And in the meantime you can join the VOG

623
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Crew right? Yeah we've got like

624
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
46 people in there last I checked

625
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Nice, very cool

626
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
My gaming week

627
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Didn't play as much video games as I would have liked to

628
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
This week but I did play a little bit

629
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Playing some Final Fantasy 14

630
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
My White Mage is

631
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
An end game I don't know how many of you are playing

632
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Final Fantasy 14 out there are an end game

633
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
But if you are an end game then you'll understand when I say

634
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
I got my Ifrit weapon

635
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
From the Primal Fight and then

636
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Two days later got my Garuda one after

637
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
So many tries on the Ifrit one

638
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Like two days later I get the better one from Garuda but whatever

639
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
And I finally got enough

640
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Tombstones to get my Dark Light gear

641
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
So again if you don't play Final Fantasy 14

642
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
That probably means nothing to you

643
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
But that's what I've been kind of clunking away at there

644
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Is grinding away the end game there

645
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
As far as other games I've played

646
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Was playing some more Audiosurf 2

647
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
They've been adding little bits and pieces to that every day

648
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Since it is one of those Steam Early Access games

649
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
So that's pretty cool I want to do some live streaming

650
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Of that pretty soon because I really

651
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Really like what they're doing with that so

652
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
I want to kind of play that for you guys

653
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
And let's see what else did I play this week

654
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I went back

655
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
And visited Pac-Man Championship Edition

656
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Because I don't know if you guys know

657
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
But they just came out with the Pac-Man Championship Edition Plus

658
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Like the Plus add-on

659
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Which is pretty much just a free patch

660
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
For Pac-Man Championship Edition

661
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
But now they have a little bit of a

662
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Store kind of built in there so you can buy some additional skins

663
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
You can buy a couple additional

664
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Mazes and a couple additional songs

665
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Not a lot of stuff

666
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
But you know it's fun to go back

667
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
And kind of have a reason to play that again

668
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
And I like what they did with the Dig Dug skin

669
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
And the Rally X skin

670
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
It doesn't change the game

671
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
It just makes it look like you're playing Rally X

672
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
But it's like Pac-Man style so

673
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
I don't know I kind of like that that was something a little different there

674
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
And some of the new songs are cool too

675
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
They also have the original Championship Edition 1

676
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Song in there so it's kind of

677
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Neat that you can go back and play that if you want

678
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
The other new game that I've been playing

679
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
This week

680
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Oh thank you Act F to correct me in our chatroom

681
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Live.vognetwork.com

682
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
It's DX Plus not Championship Edition

683
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Championship Edition was the first

684
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
DX Plus

685
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Excuse me if I'm getting confused with all these

686
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
freaking Pac-Man games

687
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Then we had Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man

688
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
And Junior Pac-Man and Baby Pac-Man

689
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Yeah Pac-Mania anyway

690
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Okay so

691
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
New game I played this week

692
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Last week I told the hilarious

693
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Story about how I loaned my 3DS

694
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Out to Princess Irene who then

695
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Went to Japan which came back from Japan

696
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
So today I was finally able to play

697
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Pokemon Y

698
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
I will play a lot of it but I will say

699
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
It is

700
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
It's about time we finally get a next gen

701
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Pokemon game because

702
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
This is the first time I've played a Pokemon game

703
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
In a while where I'm like

704
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Oh wow this looks really good

705
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
This looks like it's running on the

706
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Current hardware because let's face it

707
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Black 2 and White 2 and Black and White

708
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Were not up to par

709
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
With where the DS was at at that point

710
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
And that's probably part of the

711
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Or probably the decision to

712
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Make those games DS and not

713
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
3DS probably plays into that

714
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
A little bit but since X and Y

715
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Are 3DS games you finally get a little

716
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
More kind of power in those games

717
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
And it's about time like

718
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Kind of playing the game really made me

719
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Realize like just how kind of

720
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Behind the times

721
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
The other last

722
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Couple series were

723
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
So yeah and I'm

724
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
I'm loving that

725
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Within just a few minutes

726
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Of being in the game and kind of getting

727
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Going and going into the first area

728
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
There's already a diverse

729
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Amount of Pokemon in the very first area

730
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Like you're not just gonna get

731
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
A bunch of Bidoofs and Pidgeys

732
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
In the first area there's actually like

733
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
7 different Pokemon like enough where

734
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
You're already sending Pokemon to the box

735
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Within the first little zone

736
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Is the box like putting them to sleep?

737
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
No it's putting them in the computer is

738
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
What it is and there's a

739
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Pikachu in the very first zone

740
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
And you know that's the type of

741
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Pokemon that people really want

742
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
People don't go into a Pokemon game going

743
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
I really want a Pidgey

744
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Or I really want a ZigZagZoon or I don't know

745
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Maybe you do but most people don't

746
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Most people want Pikachu

747
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
They want the cute stuff

748
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Oh hell no I want that dark dog

749
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Looking one I think it's awesome

750
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
So

751
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Anyhow I like that there was already

752
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
That diversity and so forth

753
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
And again the combat looks great

754
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
The only downer is if you're playing

755
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Combat in 3D mode

756
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Very noticeable dip in quality

757
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
And I'm sure you've heard this a lot of places

758
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
But I'm telling you too

759
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Very noticeable dip in quality

760
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
It's almost as if this game was made for the 2DS

761
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Honestly

762
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
And I kind of think it was in some regards

763
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
And I think most people will be playing it with the 3D off

764
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Because like when you're walking around the map

765
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
And everything it doesn't even really

766
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Doesn't really use the 3D

767
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
It only uses the 3D in the battles and maybe

768
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Like in the opening and things like that

769
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
That's really it but I mean that doesn't really affect the game

770
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
At the end of the day but it is a very

771
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Interesting sign for

772
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Maybe this 3DS

773
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Or 3D thing is

774
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Gonna be gone a little sooner than we think

775
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
They tricked you into buying another Gameboy didn't they

776
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
No I did not buy

777
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
I waited for Irene to bring my other 3DS back

778
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
No I'm just saying that

779
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
You know the whole thing remember

780
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
The thing that Nintendo is really good about is getting

781
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
People to buy the Gameboy over and over and over again

782
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
They'll have the Gameboy, the Gameboy Color, the Gameboy Pocket

783
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
You know the Gameboy Advance

784
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
SP and so on and so forth

785
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Different colors

786
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
The DS, the DSi, the DSi XL

787
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
The 3DS which is

788
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Basically a DS anyways

789
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
And now they're like oh hey

790
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
We don't really need the 3D anymore

791
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
So it's basically a fancy DS

792
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
They got you to buy another DS which in turn

793
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Is basically a Gameboy Advance which is

794
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
A Gameboy

795
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
I will say this it's not coming up in tonight's news

796
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Other stuff to talk about but

797
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
There is that 3DS XL with the

798
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Legend of Zelda the two Triforces

799
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
In the top and bottom that 3DS XL

800
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Is coming out

801
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
It was in the leaked GameStop Black Friday

802
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Ad I'm really hoping

803
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
It is not a GameStop exclusive

804
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
I don't know at this point

805
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Please don't please don't be

806
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
An exclusive because I really want one

807
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
But I won't buy it if it's a GameStop

808
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Exclusive I won't buy it

809
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
But I probably will buy that

810
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Because I'm a consumer whore

811
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Or more like

812
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
I haven't been this excited for a Zelda game

813
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
In a very long time like the fact that they're making

814
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
A sequel to Link to the Past I'm like yes please

815
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Admit one please

816
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
So I'm definitely looking forward to that

817
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
However this whole fact that

818
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Some of the games are really just saying

819
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Ah fuck 3D that are coming from Nintendo

820
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Well I guess technically Pokemon

821
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Is not a first party Nintendo game but it's like a second

822
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Party it's like

823
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
It's first party they own the company that makes it

824
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
But Pokemon Company is in a really weird place

825
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Because don't forget Pokemon Company makes iPhone

826
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Apps too which is something Nintendo refuses to do

827
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Oh no I guess they're going to make Miiverse though

828
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
I guess maybe that is changing

829
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
It's first party

830
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Well whatever it is

831
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
It's still you know

832
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
It's still interesting

833
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Anyway I'm very

834
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Curious to see what's going to happen next

835
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
With the DS and I'm kind of wondering if we're

836
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Going to see a new DS like I don't know if we

837
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Would see like a new full DS next

838
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Next year but I kind of I just feel like

839
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
It wouldn't be Nintendo if we didn't get some

840
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Sort of handheld next year you know what I mean

841
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
We got the 2DS this year which you know whatever

842
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
I'm really curious what happens next year

843
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Is it going to be the 2DS and the clam shell that

844
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Everybody wants or is it going to be like

845
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
3DS XL Uber

846
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Or something you know I'm so curious

847
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Tablet

848
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
It's already one screen you just take the little

849
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Middle the middle thing out of the

850
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Out of the way and then there you go

851
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
You have one giant screen that you

852
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Can play 2DS games on or

853
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
3DS games whatever you want to call them

854
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
So a Nintendo iPad

855
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
And then basically the whole thing is a touch screen

856
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
So you can run these you know games that are that big

857
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Or I don't know they'll allow

858
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
You to run 3DS games on your

859
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Wii U

860
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Because that's going to happen

861
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Eventually I will say it

862
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Again and again it's going to happen

863
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Maybe every single week but eventually it'll happen

864
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
I'll be like see I told you so

865
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Or it won't ever happen

866
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
And you'll just forget you ever said anything

867
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
So alright so yeah Pokemon Y

868
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
I'm enjoying it I'm going to play a little more

869
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Way more into it than I was

870
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Black or Black 2 or any of the

871
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Previous Pokemon games that I have been playing

872
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
So I'll let you know how that goes

873
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
I'll let you know if I actually am able to stick with it

874
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
To beat a few gym leaders

875
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Or if I end up giving it up and going back to MMOs full time

876
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
We'll see

877
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Alright over at live.vognetwork.com

878
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Techness in our chatroom says

879
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
I remember playing yellow

880
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
It was pretty much yay I finally have a Pikachu

881
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Then it became crap he's useless

882
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
When you hit the first gym and end up wasting time

883
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Leveling up some mediocre grass type

884
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Yeah kind of

885
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Is the one bummer about Pokemon games sometimes

886
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Is that you don't necessarily get to really

887
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Play with that starter if

888
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
You know the gym you want to fight is

889
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Strong to that type but there's

890
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Such a diversity you usually find something else

891
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
You like like I think it's I started with

892
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Fennekin obviously but then when I got that

893
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Pikachu in the first zone I was like hell yeah

894
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
So now I have a Pikachu

895
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
And then I like to have a Pidgey too

896
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Because they have the air attack and all that

897
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Although he'll probably get replaced later

898
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
But for now you know so

899
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Anyway

900
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Let's see going to the chatroom

901
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
At live.vognetwork.com

902
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Codeman suggests the Nintendo 4DS

903
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
You move with the game

904
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Now if you were going to go fourth dimension

905
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
It'd have to be time travel

906
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Which is already available in Animal Crossing

907
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
And technically the

908
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
3DS has a gyroscope in it so

909
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
It kind of does detect motion it counts your steps

910
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Right remember that

911
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Alright so there you go

912
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Alright before we get into

913
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Some housekeeping and our

914
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Gaming news I'll take another question

915
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Here from Jimbo in our chatroom

916
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
At live.vognetwork.com says

917
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Are Sky, Loki, and Dark Sakura all getting

918
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
The new systems?

919
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Good question are we getting the new

920
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Systems? We're likely

921
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Getting a PS4

922
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
But I need a job

923
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
I still have a

924
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
PlayStation 4 on pre-order

925
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Although we're going to get into some news here

926
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Very shortly that kind of makes me

927
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Make a sad face when it comes to that

928
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
I mean I'll still get it but yeah

929
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Loki? Not at launch

930
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Not at launch? I'm not getting it

931
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Launch accounts on my pre-order sorry

932
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Or pre-order because I didn't pre-order

933
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
The Xbox one please

934
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Alright

935
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Going to our housekeeping

936
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Just want to tease that we

937
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Have our Facebook

938
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
And our Twitter

939
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
So please be our friend

940
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
On those sites

941
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Also just letting you know and this may be news

942
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
To my co-host too sorry about it

943
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
But there may not be a show November

944
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
10th it's looking like I'm going to be out

945
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Of town thanks to Blizzcon

946
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Even though I'm not going

947
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
I'm not going to Blizzcon

948
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
I'm going to Blizzcon and I'm going to the Blizzcon

949
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Parties

950
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
So may not be a show

951
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
November 10th unless I'm able to rush home and be

952
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Here in time we'll see

953
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Just letting you know in advance but we still

954
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Have a couple weeks of show before we get there

955
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Alright let's get into gaming news

956
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
And Loki some of the sad

957
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
News for Playstation 4

958
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Awaitors this week right?

959
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
It was bound to happen but games

960
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Are being delayed I'm not too

961
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Surprised by this Watchdogs has been

962
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Delayed to Spring 2014

963
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
And the reason why I'm not surprised by this is

964
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Because Ubisoft has a ton of fucking titles coming

965
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Out in the fourth quarter including

966
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Assassin's Creed 4 and South Park

967
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Among them

968
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
So to have Watchdogs

969
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Coming out at the same time I mean Watchdogs

970
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Is almost kind of competing with Assassin's Creed

971
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
So why would they want to compete with themselves?

972
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Might as well just put out your game

973
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
In a slower period of the year

974
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
And polish it up

975
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Even more even though it does kind of suck

976
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
For people that were hoping to

977
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Buy that as a next gen game

978
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
When I was actually thinking about getting a Playstation 4

979
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
That would have been one of the titles I would have probably picked up

980
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
For it but

981
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Yeah I guess we just got the

982
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Wait right now it's expected to be

983
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Hitting in the next financial year

984
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Which I believe they're estimating that

985
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
To be second quarter

986
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Of 2014

987
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Also to go along with

988
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
That the crew has been delayed

989
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
To mid 2014

990
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
And you know

991
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Around the I guess

992
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Summer period so that

993
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Runs July 2014 to

994
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
September 2014

995
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
And

996
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
I'm not surprised I mean I don't even think they really had

997
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
A date for that other than I think it was supposed to be

998
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Early 2014 so

999
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Whatever one is kind of disappointing

1000
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Though Sony one of their

1001
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
First party

1002
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Launch titles has been delayed Drive Club

1003
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Which was supposed to be one of those

1004
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Games they actually got at least a

1005
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Somewhat complete

1006
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Version of for

1007
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Playstation Plus now you're just gonna have to wait

1008
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
To play it early 2014 for that

1009
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
That one stings a little bit

1010
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
That was the one I think a lot of people

1011
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Were looking forward to you know driving games

1012
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Are usually a great way to show off

1013
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
The graphical oomph of a new system

1014
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
So that one hurts a little bit

1015
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
I mean I guess there's still Need for Speed

1016
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
But

1017
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Yeah but this is more of I think it's more of

1018
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Simulation racing so

1019
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Need for Speed is definitely arcade

1020
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
It's not necessarily like

1021
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
4 is a 5 or something

1022
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Maybe Gran Turismo 6 but that's

1023
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Playstation 3

1024
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
I think with all this stuff kind of

1025
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Being delayed once again it makes it also

1026
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
A hard sell for a next gen system because

1027
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
A lot of these games that are coming out

1028
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
There's not a whole ton of exclusives

1029
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
For these next gen systems at

1030
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Launch and there's still

1031
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Really good games coming out on current gen

1032
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
I mean right now

1033
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Gran Turismo 5 is not on

1034
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Next gen, Gran Turismo 6 is not

1035
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
On next gen

1036
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
You know there's

1037
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Plenty of games out there that

1038
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
They don't have next gen versions for and

1039
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Call of Duty let's be honest it's probably not going to be

1040
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
That much better on Playstation 4

1041
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Or Xbox One aside from

1042
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Graphics it'll probably look nicer

1043
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
You know it's also interesting that

1044
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Big controversy

1045
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
A couple weeks ago when Sony delayed

1046
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
The Playstation 4 in Japan

1047
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
To next year because they said

1048
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
You know what we're really not going to have games out

1049
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Available for it this holiday

1050
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
And now it's kind of looking like

1051
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Yeah maybe that is

1052
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
The case you know

1053
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
I was curious what games

1054
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Are going to be out at launch

1055
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
What is going to be out on the Playstation 4

1056
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
I have a partial list here on wiki

1057
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
This is wikipedia

1058
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
I have mine full list up in my head

1059
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Okay so as far as

1060
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
I can only really speak to North America because I have no idea

1061
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
No that's fine that's what I want to know

1062
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
So first party titles

1063
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Are going to be coming out you have of course Killzone

1064
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Shadow Fall

1065
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
You have Knack

1066
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
And that's

1067
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Pretty much it actually

1068
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
That is it since Drive Club

1069
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Fell off that's it

1070
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Third party you've got Call of Duty

1071
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Assassin's Creed 4, Battlefield 4

1072
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Need for Speed

1073
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
NBA Live

1074
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
NBA 2K14

1075
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
There's also

1076
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
What was the other ones here

1077
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
There was

1078
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Something no one's going to really pick up

1079
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Skylanders, Swap Force

1080
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Lego Marvel Super Heroes

1081
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Angry Birds Star Wars

1082
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
The only ones

1083
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
I'm not hearing is

1084
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Need for Speed Rivals

1085
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Did you Just Dance 2014

1086
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Yeah Just Dance 2014 is coming out

1087
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
You said one of the NBA games

1088
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
But there's two on the list

1089
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
NBA Live which is next to

1090
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
exclusive and NBA 2K14

1091
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Now there are some

1092
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Network games too

1093
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Which I know you wouldn't be as up on

1094
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
But there's things like Contrast

1095
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Divekick

1096
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Minecraft and Pinball Arcade

1097
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Resogun is another one

1098
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Those are all things that are set to be

1099
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Available on Playstation Network

1100
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Injustice also

1101
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Injustice Ultimate Edition

1102
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
That's right

1103
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
And Injustice

1104
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Injustice, at least the next gen version

1105
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Is exclusive to the Playstation 4

1106
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
So they do have that I guess

1107
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
I was going to say also

1108
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Xbox One

1109
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
They still have a decent lineup

1110
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
They've got all three of their games

1111
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
I was just going to say, Xbox One

1112
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
As much as they've been getting the short end of the stick

1113
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
With their popularity on the internet

1114
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Some things they do have

1115
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
That they're going to have on the 22nd

1116
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
They will have Crimson Dragon

1117
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Dead Rising 3

1118
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Forza Motorsport 5

1119
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Killer Instinct, although I kind of

1120
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
I've got to be honest, I don't care about Killer Instinct anymore

1121
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Rise

1122
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
And let's see, Power Star Golf

1123
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
It says it's exclusive

1124
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
The Xbox Fitness game as well

1125
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
There's also the Zumba Fitness game

1126
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
And yeah

1127
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
And then a lot of those same third party games

1128
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
We've already mentioned before

1129
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
I mean, Xbox, it's funny

1130
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
It really does have more exclusives

1131
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
That comes out, but it's going to be interesting to see

1132
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Are people going to pay the other $100

1133
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
To get in on that

1134
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
And really

1135
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Are the exclusives good enough

1136
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
I'm going to be honest, when I look at this list

1137
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
I go, Rise

1138
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Eh, Killer Instinct

1139
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Maybe, but I don't like what I'm hearing about it

1140
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Crimson Dragon, okay yeah

1141
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
I'd like to check that one out

1142
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
But would that sell you a system? Probably not

1143
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
I don't think so, no

1144
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Like, had it been a new Halo game

1145
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
That might have tipped the scales

1146
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Had it been that Quantum Break, that definitely would have tipped the scales

1147
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
So

1148
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
You know

1149
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Honestly, it comes down to the third party games

1150
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
For me, I think I would like to play Need for Speed

1151
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
For sure

1152
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
I'd like to check out the Lego game

1153
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Because usually those are pretty good

1154
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
But the Lego game to me

1155
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
If you really want to, it's coming out on the Wii U

1156
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
About a month before it comes out on the other system

1157
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
So it's not really a game that needs the next gen

1158
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Version of

1159
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Skylanders, please

1160
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
That's not a game that needs the next gen version

1161
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
I mean, seriously, that's going to be important

1162
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Angry Birds Star Wars

1163
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Really?

1164
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
No one cared, no one cared

1165
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
So

1166
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Yeah, that's kind of where it was

1167
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Even when they had their full lineups

1168
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Well, there's not really a lot that's selling me

1169
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
On these next gen systems

1170
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
The only first party game that looked really good

1171
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
To me for Playstation 4 was Infamous

1172
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Second Son

1173
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Kind of cool

1174
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Killzone, I'm just not a fan of Killzone

1175
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
If it was a new Resistance game that looked that nice

1176
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Okay, then

1177
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
I would probably pick that up

1178
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
I have to be honest

1179
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
I almost feel like in a way I kind of have to get on board

1180
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
With the next generation

1181
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Just because I have this show

1182
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
And I want to be able to talk about games on the show

1183
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
See, I felt that way before

1184
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
The last generation

1185
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
I bought all three systems

1186
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
And that was a mistake because I just don't play all three systems

1187
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
I don't play the Wii

1188
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
And the Playstation 3 has just gotten a little bit more activity

1189
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Now that I'm playing Grand Theft Auto on both systems

1190
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
But

1191
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
It was pretty much collecting dust

1192
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
And the Xbox 360 was the only thing I was playing on

1193
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
And a lot of people now are upgrading to the Xbox One

1194
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Because they figure

1195
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Well, I've invested all this time in the Xbox 360

1196
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
I might as well go along with that

1197
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
To carry over my gamer score

1198
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Which really doesn't mean anything, folks

1199
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Just saying

1200
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Wouldn't your trophy information on Playstation carry over too?

1201
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Yeah, that's going to carry over too

1202
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
I'm talking about the 360

1203
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
So, I mean, that doesn't really count for anything

1204
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
You know

1205
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
I just, I can't do that anymore

1206
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
And even when I do go to buy a system

1207
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
I'm not going to buy

1208
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
All of the different systems out there

1209
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Just because I don't have time to play all of them

1210
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
And honestly, I don't want to waste money

1211
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
On more than one system

1212
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
So

1213
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
I'll just wait and see

1214
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
I'm sure the price drops will happen

1215
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Or at least there'll be more games out there

1216
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
So might as well wait

1217
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
For something that I really want to play

1218
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Like a next-gen version of Grand Theft Auto 5

1219
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Alright, we'll see

1220
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Anyhow

1221
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Yeah, I'm curious to see

1222
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
How that all pans out this holiday season

1223
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Like what games end up being the big seller

1224
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
This holiday

1225
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Because I gotta say

1226
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
It's really funny, the games

1227
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
I'm looking forward to the most

1228
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Are on Wii U

1229
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
I would say the game I'm looking forward to

1230
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
The most this holiday is

1231
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Mario 3D World 2

1232
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Or whatever they're calling it on Wii U

1233
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
God, I can't even tell these games apart anymore

1234
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
All I know is it's a new Mario game on Wii U

1235
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
And I want

1236
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
And that would be the game I'm probably looking forward to the most

1237
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
So

1238
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Anyway

1239
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Speaking of Xbox One

1240
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Xbox One, not going to be doing any type of

1241
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Real name integration at launch

1242
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
You're still going to be using your gamer tags

1243
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
At launch, now don't

1244
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Miss-hear me here, I'm not saying that Xbox was going to

1245
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Plan to switch everybody to their real names

1246
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Although that would be hilarious for the trolls

1247
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
But you know I'm not here for that either

1248
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
I threw a fit

1249
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
When Blizzard threatened to do it with real ID

1250
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
And I threw a fit here too

1251
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Well, remember, Sony's planning on doing that

1252
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
They are, but Sony's planning on doing it through your Facebook

1253
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
And you can use a fake name on Facebook

1254
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
You're not supposed to, but you can

1255
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
They didn't steal it from your credit card

1256
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Which still rubs me the wrong way to this day

1257
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Anyway

1258
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
The game tags

1259
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Are all you're going to have on Xbox One

1260
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
They did say

1261
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Our teams are working hard to deliver a quality experience

1262
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
For Xbox One, this means

1263
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Prioritizing some features and sometimes

1264
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Postponing others for a later

1265
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Update

1266
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Honestly, I don't miss the fact that they're not

1267
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Going to use my real name

1268
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Who cares? Not something I really want them to use

1269
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Did Xbox say it's coming off of

1270
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Facebook? Because if they get that from my credit card

1271
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
I will not be happy

1272
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
I would imagine it would have to come from Facebook

1273
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Because not everyone's

1274
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Going to be, they have alternate payment

1275
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Forms now, it's not all just through a credit card

1276
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
I guess that's true

1277
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
But just so you know, the real names are how

1278
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
People are supposed to be able to search for you

1279
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Like if they want to be able to find you

1280
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Or whatever, but then I would think like, well what kind of privacy

1281
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Restrictions are they going to put in place? I kind of don't

1282
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Want people to search for my name and find me

1283
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Sorry, if I want you to find me

1284
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
I'll give you my gamertag

1285
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Any listener of this show that's ever asked for it

1286
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Honestly, there's a lot of people that share my name

1287
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
The upside of having real names

1288
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
However, is that it removes that aspect

1289
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Of anonymity for trolls

1290
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
But I don't think they're going to

1291
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
See, that's where your mind goes

1292
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
But I don't think they're going to show that

1293
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
That would be a huge privacy thing

1294
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Or it's even worse and they are now

1295
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Able to track you down based on your real

1296
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
Name and then they control you beyond

1297
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Xbox on

1298
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Facebook or

1299
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Having the

1300
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Maybe keeping the name secret

1301
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
But having it for issues of just searching

1302
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
If you know who you're looking for

1303
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
That might be something different

1304
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
However, I don't know

1305
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
But yeah, I got to be honest

1306
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
If I want you to find me, I'll give you my gamertag

1307
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Exactly, I don't need you to be able to

1308
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Just search for my name

1309
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Or whatever, I think what they're trying to do is

1310
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
They're trying to integrate it with Facebook even tighter

1311
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
So that way, you know, once you

1312
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Once it gets you to connect it one time

1313
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
It's going to be like, look at all these people

1314
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
You don't have on your Xbox friends list yet

1315
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
But you're friends with them on Facebook

1316
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Add, add, add, add, don't you want to add them now

1317
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
So you can send them cookies and

1318
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Fight with them on

1319
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Killer Instinct

1320
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
And all this stuff

1321
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
So

1322
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Going to our chatroom at

1323
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Live.vognetwork.com

1324
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Ragenator says, Sky, why associate

1325
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
A credit card number with a system

1326
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Where there's those PSN, Wii, Xbox Live

1327
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Funds, cards that are everywhere

1328
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Cause it's an extra step

1329
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
No, that's a good point

1330
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
And I try not to give them that information anymore

1331
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
But I think they have it on file cause my

1332
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Xbox Gold still comes from that

1333
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
And historically, they would have had

1334
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
That information anyway

1335
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
So, there you go

1336
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
S2100matt in chat says

1337
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
I don't really want people to know my real name here

1338
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
Sure, I want to play with people

1339
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
But I don't really want people to know my real name

1340
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
Yeah, I'm kind of with you and if these systems

1341
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
Are going to review, either one of them

1342
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
If it's unveiled that they're

1343
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Going to show the real names or whatever

1344
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
I'm out, I'm not buying the system

1345
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
If that crap is in there

1346
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Yes, I do want anonymity

1347
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
But it's not to troll people, it's because

1348
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
I play video games to escape the real world

1349
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
Sometimes

1350
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
So, just saying

1351
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Besides, we all know that the Xbox One is going to take

1352
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
A picture of your junk and assign it to your real

1353
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
And then it will have your real name on it

1354
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Just saying

1355
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Maybe Xbox should think about

1356
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Just not implementing that feature

1357
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Like, is it really that big a deal?

1358
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
And even though I do have the PlayStation 4 on pre-order

1359
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
I'm going to be very curious to see what happens

1360
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
With those early units and what might come out about that

1361
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Anyhow

1362
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Wine, whine, complain, complain

1363
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
DarkSakura

1364
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Well, for something that is not

1365
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Complain worthy, something that's actually good

1366
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Is that Squeenix said

1367
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
That Kingdom Hearts 2.5 Remix

1368
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Is a compilation

1369
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
HD compilation that has

1370
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
The Kingdom Hearts 2 final mix, Birth by Sleep

1371
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
Final mix

1372
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
And the remastered cinematics from

1373
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Re-coded

1374
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
And it's going to be on

1375
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
PS3 and is

1376
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Going to be out in 2014

1377
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
But no mention of PS4

1378
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
So this will be

1379
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Coming after the 1.5 remix

1380
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
So yay

1381
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
More HD

1382
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
More Kingdom Hearts

1383
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
I

1384
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Saw that new trailer though

1385
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
For Kingdom Hearts 3

1386
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Sexy

1387
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Sexy

1388
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
What did I say on my friend's Facebook? I think I said

1389
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
This is serving up some Big Thunder Mountain Electric Parade

1390
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Realness

1391
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Now I did watch it and I was just like

1392
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
This looks like more Kingdom Hearts

1393
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
I think it wasn't really Big Thunder Mountain at all

1394
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
I think that train was part of the Electric Parade

1395
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Yeah, and it didn't

1396
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
His name was in the corner and it didn't say Big Thunder Mountain

1397
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Granted they might call it something

1398
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Different in Japan, I don't know

1399
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
But it was interesting that

1400
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Anything they did show did not incorporate

1401
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Any other Disney properties

1402
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Besides the Goofy and Donald

1403
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Sidekicks that you expect to see

1404
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Because you saw Traverse Town

1405
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
And then you saw a big pirate ship

1406
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
That was like flipping around in circles

1407
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
And then you didn't really

1408
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Like you didn't see

1409
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
Mulan World

1410
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
You didn't see Tron

1411
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
You didn't see 100 Acre Wood

1412
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
You didn't see any of that stuff

1413
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
So we still don't know exactly what's going to be represented in the game

1414
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
But I figure they want to keep most of that a secret for a good long while

1415
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
Well and also if I'm right

1416
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
At the two Disney parks in Japan

1417
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
I think that there's not a Big Thunder

1418
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
I think that they've

1419
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
Combined that concept with the Indiana Jones

1420
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Ride to have an outdoor roller coaster

1421
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
That sometimes runs backwards

1422
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
And wouldn't that be fascinating

1423
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
If they had an Indiana Jones level

1424
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
Something that incorporates the Lucas Arts

1425
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
They technically can

1426
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
They can but

1427
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Marvel? I wonder if they will

1428
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
I mean that's a little bit more separate but Marvel

1429
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
I think they're going to keep it Disney

1430
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
To Squeenix and leave it there

1431
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
I think they will too

1432
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
But I could see like a very subtle

1433
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
Like here comes Indiana Jones

1434
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Like I could see that like being a thing

1435
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Just like a little bit of a

1436
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Wink and a nod to some of their recent acquisitions

1437
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
I think putting Marvel in there

1438
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Would be too much

1439
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
That's like a completely different universe

1440
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
What about Pixar stuff?

1441
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
I really hope they do

1442
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
I think some of the Pixar games would make for great levels

1443
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
Especially with how they've been pushing

1444
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
The Cars franchise

1445
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Cars Land and all that

1446
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
Has been huge

1447
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
For a very short ride

1448
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Oh my god

1449
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
I would love to do something in the WALL-E universe

1450
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
WALL-E is kind of set on Earth

1451
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
So I don't know exactly what they would do with that

1452
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
But we'll see

1453
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Incredibles?

1454
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
I'd be cool

1455
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
But yeah a lot of the Pixar stories are sort of like

1456
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
They're not really about their worlds

1457
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
So much as they are the characters I think

1458
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Star Wars would be cool though

1459
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Star Wars would be very cool

1460
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
Dark Soccer did you see the other news about Kingdom Hearts 3?

1461
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
Um

1462
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Let me uh

1463
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
No

1464
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
Because my iPad's being a shit again

1465
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
Hold on

1466
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
I believe there is a little bit more news

1467
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
And of course it is something that we're pretty

1468
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
Aware

1469
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
Was going to happen regardless

1470
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
Is that Utada Hikaru is

1471
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Well may return

1472
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
For Kingdom Hearts 3

1473
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
Which I think is probably going to happen

1474
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
She really should I mean

1475
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
But she's been on a musical hiatus or something right?

1476
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Didn't she take a break or something?

1477
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
She did

1478
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
But there was actually a post

1479
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
That came from

1480
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Utada Teruzane

1481
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Who is his

1482
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
Her dad

1483
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
Who said that the two of them were

1484
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
Undecided when it came to Kingdom Hearts 3

1485
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
So she's

1486
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
Not contributing a new theme song

1487
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
But there's a chance she might help

1488
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
I sure hope she does

1489
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
Do something with it that would be great

1490
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
Because the songs especially Simple and Clean

1491
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
Was so important to Kingdom Hearts you know

1492
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Yeah

1493
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
Codeman in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com

1494
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
Says Wreck It Ralph World

1495
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
That would be too meta

1496
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Although Sugar Rush would be pretty great

1497
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
I could still see them doing that

1498
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
Like a Sugar Rush level would be kind of

1499
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
Like just even like instead of the gummy ship

1500
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Tangled

1501
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
I could see Tangled

1502
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Oh I could totally see Tangled

1503
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
I kind of hope they do that

1504
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
That would be great

1505
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
Have they done this yet because I liked it

1506
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
I thought it was a good movie

1507
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
Emperor's New Groove

1508
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
I don't think they did

1509
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
Let's see

1510
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
SSG100Matt says

1511
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
Indiana Jones in Kingdom Hearts would be better than the Crystal Skull

1512
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
Well ain't that the truth

1513
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
As long as

1514
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
I have bars low

1515
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Shia LaBeouf is not allowed to be in Kingdom Hearts

1516
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
Do not let that kid anywhere near

1517
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
Kingdom Hearts

1518
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
You keep Shia LaBeouf away

1519
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
From Kingdom Hearts

1520
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
Not gonna happen

1521
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
Ooh Act Deaf is suggesting Brave

1522
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
Great Pixar movie

1523
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
I could totally see that as well

1524
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
That would be great

1525
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
We could fan wank Kingdom Hearts

1526
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
Worlds all day long but the reality is

1527
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
We are just not gonna know until they make

1528
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Some formal announcements so we'll see what happens

1529
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
Loki

1530
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
Alright so some other good news for the Xbox One

1531
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
Platform

1532
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
They are making available to all the developers

1533
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
The Xbox Live Compute

1534
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
I don't know if you would call it

1535
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
I guess

1536
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
SDK which is basically

1537
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
The ability to use the cloud servers

1538
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
For off platform

1539
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
Computations

1540
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
Including physics and

1541
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
More importantly dedicated

1542
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
Servers and so because

1543
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
Of that dedicated servers

1544
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
For all multiplayer games

1545
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
Is possible

1546
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
But it has to be enabled by

1547
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
The developers

1548
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
Because they can also choose to

1549
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
Have control over that

1550
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
Versus using the Xbox Live Compute

1551
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
Stuff and

1552
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
I guess they are saying that they have

1553
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
Over 300,000

1554
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
Virtual servers

1555
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Powered by cloud technology

1556
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
So it sounds like

1557
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
That they could get some

1558
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
I mean that's definitely a plus for a lot of people

1559
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
That play multiplayer especially like Call of Duty

1560
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
And stuff that year and a half

1561
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Dedicated servers and also kind of

1562
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
Curbs cheating a bit because there's

1563
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
People that hack the platforms and stuff

1564
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
And having a dedicated

1565
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Server would kind of eliminate that

1566
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Sounds ambitious

1567
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
And entirely

1568
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
A good idea

1569
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
I'm just curious to see

1570
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
Because they keep talking about these Azure cloud

1571
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Servers and stuff and

1572
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
I'm just curious to see how

1573
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Stable that all is

1574
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Because every

1575
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
Every company comes out and says

1576
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
Hey yeah we've seen these

1577
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Problems with connectivity

1578
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
And stuff like that

1579
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
It's not going to happen to us

1580
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
We're prepared this time

1581
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
And every time it's fucked up

1582
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
So you know I'm kind of

1583
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
Curious to see how all these servers

1584
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
Are going to play into that

1585
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
Or if it's just going to be a big fucking mess

1586
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Because I wouldn't be surprised

1587
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
If it was a big fucking mess

1588
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Just because all the other

1589
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
Online games and stuff have just been

1590
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
Messy

1591
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
What will be the first Xbox game to get that

1592
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
37 equivalent or the

1593
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
SimCity connection error and all these

1594
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
Hilarities in the past

1595
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
The one that I could see would be the biggest

1596
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Pain in the ass would maybe be fours of

1597
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
Five because remember you have to download

1598
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
Part of the game

1599
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Or most of the game

1600
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
Because it's not done yet on the disk

1601
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
I can see that being a problem

1602
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
If you can't connect to their cloud servers

1603
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
Also the other thing

1604
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
Remember just like

1605
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
Rockstar just had the problem where it wasn't

1606
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
Necessarily all of the cloud servers

1607
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
But mainly the matchmaking stuff

1608
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
Was down and so even if you have

1609
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
A part of your

1610
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Service down that it could still affect

1611
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
Everything so

1612
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
I don't know

1613
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
It'd be interesting to see

1614
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
My thought is okay

1615
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
If it's so easy for you

1616
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
To do this as a company

1617
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
Microsoft then why isn't anybody

1618
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
Else doing it that way

1619
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
If this is so easy

1620
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
If it's such the right way to go

1621
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
Then why don't we have

1622
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
Rockstar hosting their stuff

1623
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
And azure servers and all that stuff

1624
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
It makes me think that there's a little bit

1625
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
More hype to it than

1626
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
It's actually gonna

1627
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
Be reality so

1628
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
I guess we'll have to see when it launches

1629
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
I'm sure we'll be talking about stories

1630
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
Of connectivity and

1631
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
I'm not saying it's probably limited to

1632
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
Microsoft at all

1633
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
If the PlayStation 4 relies heavily on

1634
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
Yeah it's probably gonna be everybody

1635
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
Alright

1636
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
Shifting gears here a little bit

1637
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
If you are a PC gamer

1638
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
By any means or even if you've just lightly played

1639
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
PC games in the past I'm sure you're

1640
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
Familiar with the game Myst

1641
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
This is one of the top selling PC games

1642
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
They ever made it's an adventure game

1643
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
And they've remade this game a ton of times

1644
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
There were a lot of games in the series

1645
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
Riven was another big game

1646
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
These were both games by Cyan

1647
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
Inc. was the name of the studio that made these games

1648
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
Well they have announced that they are

1649
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
Making a new game it's called

1650
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
Abduction not Abduction

1651
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
It's O-B-D-U-C-T-I-O-N

1652
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
Abduction is the new game

1653
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
But here's the interesting thing

1654
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
It is a Kickstarter game this is where they're

1655
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
Taking their case to Kickstarter and they're trying to get

1656
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
1.1 million dollars

1657
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
To make this game work

1658
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
They're talking about very similar

1659
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
Exploration driven gameplay that help make

1660
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
Myst a reality

1661
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
They're gonna do Unreal Engine 4

1662
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
Is what they want to be able to license

1663
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
To make this game work

1664
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
And they're targeting mid to late 2015

1665
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
So they're giving themselves

1666
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
Plenty of time to make Abduction

1667
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
Happen

1668
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
So if you want to check that out you can go to their Kickstarter

1669
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
Now the thing that really got me about this

1670
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
Though is I'm like dude this is the studio

1671
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
That made Myst and Riven

1672
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
Like why do they have to

1673
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
Turn to Kickstarter? Like surely there's

1674
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
A publisher or somebody out there that's willing

1675
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
To back them a little bit

1676
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
And I'm like well what the hell else have they done

1677
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
Outside of Riven and Myst

1678
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
Anybody know without cheating

1679
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
What some of the other games Cyan Inc. did

1680
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
In the down time

1681
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
Cause once I went to go look at the list I was like

1682
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
Oh yeah there was that game that really

1683
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
Didn't do well

1684
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
It was the one that was that Myst

1685
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
Not Myst Online or whatever the hell they ended up calling it

1686
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
That was part of, was it GameTap actually?

1687
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
It was Myst Online Uru Live

1688
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
And it didn't, you're right

1689
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
That's it, it went over to GameTap

1690
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
In the Uru games actually

1691
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
Uru I think was the third Myst

1692
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
And then they did all these different Uru games

1693
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
That Ubisoft was doing for a while

1694
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
Including Myst 5

1695
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
Went all the way there and then Myst Online

1696
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
Yeah I remember that game kind of flopped

1697
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
And GameTap picked it up and ran it for a little while

1698
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
I actually played Myst Online

1699
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
The funny thing is back in 2007

1700
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
This show was around and I think there's some

1701
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
Old episodes where I was talking about my experiences

1702
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
In Myst Online

1703
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
It was just such an odd game

1704
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
It was just like, it was so like

1705
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
Just kind of creepy

1706
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
Odd, like the ambience in that game

1707
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
Was really, like

1708
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
Chills, but I mean I enjoyed what I did

1709
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
Play of it even though it wasn't

1710
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
As obvious of a game

1711
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
As World of Warcraft or even EverQuest

1712
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
Where it's like, experience leads to

1713
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
Levels, leads to abilities, leads to gold

1714
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
Gold, gold, you know Uru Online

1715
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
Was a very different type of game

1716
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
Other than that, that was 2007

1717
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
And since then it's been a lot of

1718
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
iPhone, iPod, iPad

1719
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
Type of stuff

1720
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
They adapted Myst, they adapted Riven

1721
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
They did some games called Bugchucker

1722
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
And Stoneship

1723
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
Abduction is a very

1724
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
Kind of anxious

1725
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
Return to form, shall we say

1726
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
For this company

1727
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Best of luck to them, they just might do it

1728
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
They got a 1.1 million dollar goal

1729
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
They have raised just shy of

1730
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
Half a million, they're at $460,000

1731
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
With 26 days to go

1732
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
So they've already made

1733
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
Between a third and a half of the money

1734
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
With only 4 days down

1735
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
So that's pretty cool

1736
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
$25 or more will get you the game

1737
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
Via Kickstarter, by the way

1738
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
$45 is a digital collection

1739
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
Let's see some of the crazy

1740
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
Rewards they're giving, let's see

1741
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
$10,000 or more will give you

1742
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
An experience design at

1743
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
Cyan, you can actually go

1744
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
To an early abduction design meeting

1745
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
You can either go there

1746
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
Or join via Skype

1747
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
And I guess you get to have your say in the game

1748
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
Kind of neat

1749
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
So there you go

1750
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
And they're already looking at stretch goals too

1751
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
But they won't say what they are until they reach the base funding

1752
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Which I imagine would just be more

1753
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
Expansions of the game and so on and so on

1754
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
So

1755
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
Going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com

1756
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
SSJ100Matt says, Myst was odd

1757
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
I should go back to it

1758
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
I still have the original CD-ROM copy laying around

1759
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
Reginator says

1760
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
Riven original soundtrack is great to play

1761
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
If you're having trouble sleeping

1762
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
DungeonBuster says, Cyan went the way

1763
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
That a lot of adventure games did in the 90s

1764
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
Which is probably why they're kickstarting

1765
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
This project

1766
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
Tim Schafer had to kickstart his own adventure game

1767
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
Just to get it going

1768
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
Well it's so interesting because a lot of these projects

1769
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
End up being very successful

1770
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
So it's surprising to me

1771
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
And especially with how well The Walking Dead did

1772
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
Last year and was so well received

1773
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
And everything, I'm like, I'm really surprised

1774
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
That the mainstream is not getting

1775
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
Like, dude, people never

1776
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
Really got over the 90s adventure game

1777
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Thing, there's still very much an audience

1778
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
For that, you know

1779
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
Anyhow

1780
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
Reginator says

1781
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
SSJ100Matt is that even playable

1782
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
On modern PC's

1783
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
Well they had it in GameTap

1784
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
Even though GameTap is a few years old at this point

1785
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
You definitely could play all those games

1786
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
I'm sure

1787
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
It's gotta be on good old games, right?

1788
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
It has to be there

1789
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
Alright, there you go

1790
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
Good luck to the studio getting that going

1791
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
It'll be exciting if they get it done

1792
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
I hope it's as creepy as other games

1793
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
Dark Soccer

1794
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
Well, Rob, this actually may affect you

1795
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
May or may not affect you

1796
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
And 50,000 other people that I know

1797
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
Fucking play this game

1798
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
Do I have to go get a shot?

1799
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
No, no, no, but there is a bug

1800
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
However, it's not a sickness bug

1801
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
It's a sickness within Pokemon X and Y

1802
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
So the entire game

1803
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
Yeah, the whole game, no

1804
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
Basically, if you save your game in Lumiose City

1805
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:50,000
There is a problem where if you save in and around the streets

1806
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
Outside the city

1807
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
The game will lock up and make you have to reset your game

1808
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
And when you reboot

1809
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
The game will load the save and freeze again

1810
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
Basically it loops and loops and loops

1811
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
Now, Nintendo is aware of this

1812
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:06,000
And they're working on making a patch for it

1813
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
That will be downloaded

1814
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
When they have it done

1815
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
So at least they know about it

1816
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
At least something is going to happen

1817
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
It just hasn't happened quite yet

1818
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
And they're saying

1819
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
They've put out a map

1820
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
It's only a Japanese one

1821
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
Which I will go ahead and also

1822
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
Link to the chat room assuming it loads

1823
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:30,000
But for those of you who are affected by this

1824
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:34,000
Sorry, start over and don't save in the town

1825
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
To register participation for this week's episode

1826
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
Of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com

1827
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
Use the passphrase, rainbow

1828
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
Yeah, I'm going to make a note of that

1829
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
So I don't do that, but I do like how in the new

1830
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
Pokemon games you can practically save anywhere

1831
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
So that's pretty cool

1832
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,000
Useful

1833
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
Much useful, but it's better than trying to find a save point

1834
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
And do it that way, that's for sure

1835
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
Alright, let's travel around the world

1836
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
And check out some release dates of some games coming out soon

1837
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
That hopefully aren't broken

1838
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
That have hopefully been quality tested

1839
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
Which is, by the way, not to get all tangent-y

1840
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
Or whatever, but that's the good thing

1841
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
About those other games you were talking about earlier

1842
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
Getting delayed, like things like

1843
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
Drive Club and Watch Dogs

1844
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
And everything is that, you know what

1845
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
If they have to do that to QA the games

1846
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
And make sure that they're going to be right

1847
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
Then fine, delay them

1848
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
We'll never remember that they were delayed

1849
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
Wasn't Grand Theft Auto 5 delayed a bunch?

1850
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
We all forgave them, we forgive them, right?

1851
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
And it was worth it

1852
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
That's right, it was worth it

1853
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
So, you know what, I would rather the games get delayed

1854
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
To test the QA

1855
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
Now in this Pokemon, I don't know

1856
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
Because you can save anywhere

1857
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
I don't know if they would have found that

1858
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
During QA testing or whatever

1859
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
That would be a very tricky thing to find

1860
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
It would be

1861
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
I forgive them, but Nintendo's

1862
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
Got to be able to patch these things faster

1863
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
And more efficiently too, I think in some ways

1864
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
You know what I mean?

1865
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
Like you kind of expect on Xbox and Playstation

1866
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
It's always going to patch right away if they have them

1867
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
Nintendo can kind of be a pain in the butt

1868
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
They haven't quite figured out this whole internet thing yet

1869
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
Yeah, that's

1870
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
And I think that's part of what's their worst nightmare

1871
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
Right now with Wii U

1872
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
I'm still convinced that plays into it

1873
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
I mean, my friends have made good arguments

1874
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
About to the contrary and about how

1875
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
You know, there is DLC for like a

1876
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
Now, they just started that a year ago

1877
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
See, there's something about

1878
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
All of that

1879
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
And the fact that nothing ever showed up for Mass Effect 3

1880
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
Nothing showed up for Injustice

1881
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
And all that just kind of

1882
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
Nothing showing up for Assassin's Creed 4

1883
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
There's something really weird about that

1884
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
I mean, granted Nintendo's doing it themselves now with Super Luigi

1885
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
And all this other stuff, but

1886
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
Are they doing it differently than it was done on 360?

1887
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
I don't know, so

1888
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
You know

1889
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
I won't know, actually I don't think that has anything

1890
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
I thought it might have been Uplay

1891
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
Or something like that

1892
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
They didn't support those extra

1893
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
You know, services and stuff

1894
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
That maybe that was the problem or something

1895
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
Actually, that could be

1896
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
Now that I think of it

1897
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
If Uplay isn't supported

1898
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
Then that's why Assassin's Creed didn't get the DLC

1899
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
And EA

1900
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
Uplay has a channel on Wii U though

1901
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
Then I don't know

1902
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
Maybe they changed something

1903
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
I don't know, or maybe it's just

1904
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
Nintendo or something, I don't know

1905
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
Tangentrain, ChuChu, let's go to release dates

1906
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
So this week we actually have quite a few things

1907
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
Coming out, starting off with Naruto

1908
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000

01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
Full Burst, which is just a re-release of the game

1910
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
With DLC, PS3, and 360

1911
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
For that, Deus Ex Human Revolution

1912
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
The Director's Cut

1913
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
Coming out on PlayStation 3

1915
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
The Wii U

1916
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
And of course those are re-released for

1917
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
The other two platforms

1918
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000

01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
Wii, Wii U, 3DS

1921

And DS

1922
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
Hometown Story

1923
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
If you're a fan of the Harvest Moon games

1924
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
Sort of a spin-off of that

1925
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
That's on 3DS this week

1926
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
Lego Marvel Super Heroes

1927
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
PlayStation 3, Xbox 360

1928
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
Wii U

1929
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
3DS

1930
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
Vita and PC

1931
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
The Sims 3

1932
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
Into the Future

1933
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
Getting, that's a new expansion

1934
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
That's on PC of course

1935
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
Um

1936
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
Let's see

1937
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
Also

1938
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
Disney Infinity, some more of the

1939
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
Packs are coming out, Toy Story

1940
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
As well as the

1941
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
Woody figure, and I believe next

1942
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
Not next week, but the week after next

1943
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
Is Jack Skellington

1944
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
Where the hell is Nightmare Before Christmas? It's that time of year

1945
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
Well, it's been a GameStop exclusive

1946
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
For right now

1947
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
It's exclusive on the figurine, and Woody I think

1948
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
Is exclusive to Walmart or Target or Toys R Us

1949
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
One of those

1950
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
I got an exclusive finger for GameStop right here

1951
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
Sorry to the employees

1952
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
My anger is not with you

1953
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
The front-end associates

1954
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
If you want to get some

1955
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
2K games that have been

1956
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
Out before, there's some collections

1957
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
Coming out, including the 2K Essentials collection

1958
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
Which is, I believe

1959
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
Bioshock

1960
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
Borderlands

1961
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
And I want to say

1962
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
Oh, what the hell is the last game there?

1963
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
XCOM

1964
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
The first XCOM game

1965
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
That was on 360, Enemy

1966
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
Not really the first XCOM game

1967
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
On 360

1968
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
No, I said the first XCOM game on 360

1969
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
Okay, okay

1970
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
That's on PlayStation 3 and

1971
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
Xbox 360

1972
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
They also have another collection

1973
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
The strategy

1974
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
Collection, which is Civ 5

1975
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
And XCOM, that's on PC

1976
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
And then there's

1977
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
Another one with

1978
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
I don't remember, I'll get to that in just a second

1979
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
Let's see, Rocksmith 2014 edition

1980
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
Coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox

1981
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
360 and PC

1982
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
Of course, they also have a version without the

1983
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
Little adapter in case you bought

1984
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
The game before

1985
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
And a version with a guitar

1986
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
You need a guitar for that game

1987
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

1988
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
3DS Wii and Xbox 360

1989
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
And that's based on the new

1990
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
Cartoon series on Nickelodeon

1991
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
Just Dance Kids 2014

1992
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
On Wii and Wii U

1993
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
And Xbox 360

1994
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
Oh God, there's a kids game this year too?

1995
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
There's been a kids game for the last few years

1996
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
I knew there was the one, I didn't know

1997
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
There was four kids games last year

1998
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
God, does it have that horrible

1999
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
God, that joke

2000
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
What does the fox say?

2001
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
I don't know

2002
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
That would be pretty funny

2003
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
Oh my God, that song gets on my nerves so bad

2004
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
I've finally, by the way, seen that

2005
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
And I was sorry I saw that

2006
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
They play it on the radio now and I'm like, okay

2007
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
That was funny for a day, stop

2008
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
I'm so glad I don't listen to the radio

2009
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
It made me laugh the first time

2010
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
And after that I was like, yay

2011
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
My wife has told me, and I also saw this

2012
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
But I actually haven't listened to this song yet

2013
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
Well apparently it's a huge kids song

2014
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
It's a kids thing, but what does the fox say?

2015
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
I thought it was a stoner song

2016
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
What does the bong say?

2017
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
What about

2018
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
What about that Chinese food song

2019
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
Now that, I'm here for that

2020
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
That song

2021
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
Cracked my ass up, and the video

2022
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
Is fantastic

2023
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
I hated myself for finding it funny

2024
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
I have not seen that song yet

2025
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
The Chinese food, that's great

2026
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
Just seeing that guy take the panda thing off

2027
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
I'm like, is that dude

2028
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
It's the little things too, the little

2029
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
subtly, horribly racist things

2030
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
In the video, like when they're talking

2031
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
They're playing Monopoly, like he rhymes

2032
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
Some freaking Chinese who have Monopoly

2033
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
And then he moves the piece to Oriental Avenue

2034
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
In the video

2035
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
It's like they're going for every

2036
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
It's like they're going for every fucking

2037
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
Stereotype in the universe

2038
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
I love its badness

2039
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
But then again, Showgirls is my favorite movie

2040
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
It's sort of like, I don't know if it's trying to be

2041
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
Lisa Lampanelli style funny

2042
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
You know, offensive on purpose

2043
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
To make you think about it, or if

2044
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
It's just really being stupid

2045
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
Other things coming out this week

2046
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
A little game called Batman Arkham Origins

2047
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
That's coming out on Friday

2048
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
That's this week? Yes, on Friday

2049
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
For some reason

2050
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
That's on Playstation 3, Xbox 360

2051
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
Wii U, and PC

2052
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
And of course they have the Blackgate version

2053
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
Which is not quite Arkham Origins

2054
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
But it's a little different

2055
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
That's on 3DS and Vita

2056
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
And then Wii Party U

2057
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
For the Wii U

2058
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
And, you know, this game was so

2059
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
Great looking

2060
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
That they also have to throw a remote in there

2061
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
In a horizontal stand for your

2062
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
What games are in Wii Party U? I know nothing about this game

2063
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
It's crap

2064
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
Okay, Wii Party was terrible, it's gonna be crap

2065
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
In Soviet Russia, Wii Party U

2066
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
Just what the name makes me think of

2067
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
Some other random games coming out

2068
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
Cradle of Egypt 2

2069
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
Which is a puzzle game

2070
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
And Girls Fashion Shoot

2071
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
Which is a fashion simulator game

2072
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
That's it

2073
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
That would be everything

2074
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
Although, I do have to say this week though

2075
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
I believe it's also the DLC

2076
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
For Saints Row 4

2077
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
So there's some DLC coming out

2078
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
For that, the Enter the Dominatrix

2079
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
Stuff

2080
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
Alright, now's the part of the show where you get to

2081
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
Hear me horribly butcher Japanese

2082
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
Release dates, yay

2083
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
On the Playstation 3 in Japan on October 24th

2084
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
BlazBlue, Chrono Fantasma

2085
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
Comes out, as well as

2086
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
GQ Powerful Pro

2087
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
Yaku 2013

2088
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
Which is that soccer? It's baseball

2089
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
Baseball

2090
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
I knew it was a sport of some sort

2091
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
Also on the 24th on the Playstation 3

2092
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
Sengoku Musou 2

2093
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
With Moshuden and Empire's HD version

2094
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
Tears to Tiara 2

2095
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
Hau no Matsue

2096
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
What is Tears to Tiara?

2097
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
That sounds like somebody who cries a lot

2098
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
And becomes queen

2099
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
I don't know, but it looks like some type of

2100
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
Roleplaying-esque game

2101
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
I don't know what this is

2102
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
This is like half the other things

2103
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
I see come out

2104
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
Let's see what else, there's Root Double Before Crime

2105
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
After Days Extend Edition

2106
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
Kazuko Kiyakutomugu Ito

2107
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
In regular and limited edition

2108
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
From Cyberfront this week

2109
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
Which looks like

2110
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
I'm looking at a screenshot from this game

2111
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
And I'm sorry

2112
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
But those breasts are too much

2113
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
For that face

2114
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
For that cute little chibi face

2115
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
She's got these breasts

2116
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
She would be tipping forward

2117
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
However

2118
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
I can say

2119
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
I was quite young

2120
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
And quite stacked

2121
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
So it is possible

2122
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
That's a bit much

2123
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
I'm gonna put it this way

2124
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
I've been a D since I was 13

2125
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
You're blessed

2126
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
Nothing wrong with that

2127
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
Some girls too

2128
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
So if they don't show the boy's face

2129
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
Then it's a date rape game

2130
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
I don't know about this

2131
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
This is a little bit of an awkward picture

2132
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
That's a

2133
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
Fucking game

2134
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
So the quotes South Park

2135
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
Nice

2136
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
Not okay

2137
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
It's essentially a moe game

2138
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
Which Alan just said in the chat

2139
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
Yep

2140
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
Going to the Xbox 360

2141
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
This week in Japan

2142
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
Zero, zilch

2143
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
On the PlayStation 3 though

2144
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
That same baseball game

2145
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
GQO Powerful Pro Yakyuu 2013

2146
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
That's a Konami one

2147
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
An ongoing series too

2148
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
On the Wii U this week in Japan

2149
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
Sonic Lost World

2150
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
Which I think came out here this week

2151
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
Sonic Lost Meh

2152
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
On the Nintendo 3DS

2153
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
A bunch of Sonic stuff

2154
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
Including the Sonic Lost World port over there

2155
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
But also some little

2156
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
Headphones and cute little stickers

2157
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
And all that shit on the 3DS

2158
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
And lastly the

2159
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
PSP still getting a lot of stuff

2160
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
Right now including that same

2161
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
Baseball game from Konami

2162
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
Diablok Lovers More

2163
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
Blood

2164
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
Yes that is the name of the game

2165
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
Diablok Lovers More

2166
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
Blood

2167
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
And it does kind of look like

2168
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
Oh god it looks like Twilight

2169
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
As an anime video game

2170
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
A ton of visual novel games

2171
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
Nope

2172
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
Nope to that one

2173
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
Nope N-O-P-E

2174

2200
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
It's a question We Party You

2201
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
How about this

2202
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
Nintendo maybe you put out

2203
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
A game on your new platform

2204
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000
It doesn't have the fucking name of the system on it

2205
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
Oh ok

2206
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
I would be with you there but remember

2207
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
Wii Sports biggest game ever

2208
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
Ever

2209
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
No no no I have no problem with Wii Sports

2210
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
That's fine

2211
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
I'm talking about

2212
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
I mean the U at the end

2213
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
Like do we really need new Super Mario Brothers U

2214
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,000
Or you know

2215
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
Anything

2216
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
Kind of just what they do though

2217
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
The only system that didn't really do that was the GameCube

2218
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
I mean even with the Super Nintendo

2219
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
It was super everything

2220
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
Super Adventure Island and Super Star Wars

2221
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
And Super you know

2222
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
But they were so much better than their previous versions

2223
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
I mean come on

2224
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
There wasn't really anything that was super that wasn't awesome

2225
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
That was a pretty super system

2226
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
The 8 bit the 16 bit everything looked pretty super

2227
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
Thank you actdeft in the chat room says

2228
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
Blank 64 everything was blank 64

2229
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
On the N64

2230
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
Superman 64 Mario Kart 64

2231
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
Mario 64

2232
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
This is just what Nintendo does

2233
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,000
They beat that name into you

2234
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
Or remember when they used to do it subtly

2235
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
And this is more third parties but

2236
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
They would use it subtly on the DS

2237
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
Where it would be like you know

2238
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
Something dual souls or something

2239
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
Dragon Spirit or

2240
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,000
Even the third parties got into it like there was that Castlevania game

2241
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,000
Right there was DS

2242
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
That game made me cry

2243
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
Cry because you didn't like it or?

2244
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
It was just not good

2245
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
Alright

2246
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,000
Let's get to a couple more news stories

2247
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000

2248
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
Heck yeah

2249
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000

actdeft says super all the things

2253
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,000
It's like it's pumpkin

2254
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
Or something right now

2255
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,000
So there you go

2256
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
Live.vognetwork.com

2257
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
Let's get into some stories

2258
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
Alright so let's talk a little bit about

2259
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
Games with Gold

2260
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,000
And this was something that I was

2261
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
Kind of meh I mean it's only two games a month

2262
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
And stuff and I know a lot of direct comparisons with

2263
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,000
PlayStation Plus

2264
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
Which by the way folks

2265
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
If you haven't jumped on this yet

2266
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
Shadow of the Colossus is available on PlayStation Plus

2267
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,000
I need to jump on that

2268
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
This is Ico

2269
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
Yes Ico was last month

2270
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,000
I think it's still available

2271
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
They cycle them through every now and then

2272
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
But Shadow of the Colossus is on there now

2273
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
And also

2274
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,000
The what was it

2275
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,000
The poker game from Valve is on there now

2276
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,000
Or no not Valve

2277
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
Telltale Games

2278
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
The poker at the inventory 2

2279
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
The second one was

2280
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
Oh yeah I played that this week too for a little bit

2281
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
I suck at poker that's what I learned

2282
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,000
Yeah so those are available

2283
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
Anyways this month

2284
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,000
Of course there was Halo 3

2285
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
And then I forgot the other game

2286
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
That was coming out but they say

2287
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
Though they are going to continue on with the

2288
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
Program originally it was only supposed to go

2289
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,000
Through the launch of the Xbox One

2290
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
But they figured out that hey

2291
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
You know what people like values so

2292
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
They are going to keep on doing two games a month

2293
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
So far

2294
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
A lot of the games I already had but

2295
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
You know okay

2296
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
Yeah I mean it's cool that they are giving these away

2297
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
It's hard to complain about free stuff

2298
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
I'm going to

2299
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
It is a little hilarious that they are giving away Halo 3

2300
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
For free I don't expect them to give away Halo 4

2301
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
But I mean come on meet me halfway here

2302
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
Like maybe ODST

2303
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
Or yeah I mean

2304
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
Halo Reach

2305
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
Yeah or Anniversary Edition

2306
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
Because you know the games that are coming out

2307
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,000
Like the Shadow of the Colossus

2308
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
I think that was about a year

2309
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
Or two old

2310
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
And I mean Saints Row the Third

2311
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
About two years old and it was already on

2312
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
On there or hell Hitman Absolution

2313
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
To be fair that is a little bit fuzzy

2314
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,000
Math for Shadow of the Colossus because it is a remake

2315
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
Of a much older game

2316
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
I understand but the release of the HD version was

2317
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
I'm with you I'm with you fair enough

2318
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,000
I would be I would love to see

2319
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,000
Like some Playstation 1 games on there

2320
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,000
Or you know like Final Fantasy

2321
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,000
Yeah they kind of stopped doing the PS1 games didn't they

2322
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,000
You know like Final Fantasy or something

2323
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,000
They gave away Tactics at one point I think that was on PSP

2324
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
Yeah I think they might have given away one of the older Final Fantasy games too

2325
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,000
Or they all went on sale or something

2326
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,000
So I don't know

2327
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,000
Alright let's see Nvidia

2328
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,000
Doing an update to what's called the Geforce

2329
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
Experience this is that gameplay

2330
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
Optimization software and I've never used

2331
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
This because I have the AMD

2332
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
Or some ATI

2333
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,000
Yeah I got a pop up this morning saying that I needed

2334
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
To update that and I'm like shit I didn't even

2335
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
Know I had it so okay

2336
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
But I bring this up because one of the things

2337
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
They're going to be adding to this is that they're going to be able

2338
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,000
You're going to be able to capture gameplay

2339
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
If you have a 600 or a 700 series card

2340
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
So you can edit and you can upload

2341
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
And of course even more people now

2342
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
Streaming their games on Twitch I mean this is becoming

2343
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
A real huge thing which is

2344
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,000
You know as somebody who really loves independent broadcasting

2345
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,000
I mean I do kind of love it but at the same time

2346
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
I'm like wow

2347
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
It's going to be even more like competition

2348
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
For watching

2349
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
Like if everybody's streaming who's watching

2350
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
So it's going to be very interesting but I do love that it makes it

2351
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,000
Very easy at least

2352
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,000
And let's see there's also what they call shadow mode

2353
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,000
Which will follow your gameplay and it will

2354
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
Save the last 10 to 20 minutes of action

2355
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
In a temporary buffer on your hard drive

2356
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,000
And if you hit a hotkey you can save

2357
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
The buffered footage and that way

2358
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,000
Your stuff doesn't pile up on the hard drive

2359
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
There you go that's basically what we have on the next gen

2360
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
Yeah what the next gen consoles are doing they're starting to catch

2361
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000
This up a little bit

2362
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
But it's 10 to 20 minutes and not you know

2363
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,000
I would imagine it's whatever you have available

2364
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,000
On your drive too

2365
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,000
So

2366
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
Most likely

2367
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
So there it is

2368
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
Some folks are going to be checking that out

2369
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
I'm pretty sure ATI is only a matter of time before they have a response

2370
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
To this and their own thing

2371
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
If they don't already

2372
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
Exactly

2373
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
I can't watch your channel because I'm streaming on my channel

2374
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
Yeah

2375
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
It's going to be that

2376
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
Eventually there's not going to be anyone to view these channels

2377
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
Because everyone's going to be streaming their games

2378
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
And clogging the internet

2379
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
And it's all one site too

2380
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
Which is fascinating to me

2381
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
I mean I know there's like Ustream and a couple others

2382
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
But it's really fascinating to me that like one company

2383
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
Has such a huge share of this

2384
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
Clearly they must be using those

2385
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
Microsoft cloud azure servers

2386
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
Or something

2387
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
Alright let's travel to a time

2388
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
When gaming was a little more simple

2389
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
If you wanted to see a hot new video game

2390
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
You had to go over to your rich friend's house and watch

2391
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
That's what you had to do

2392
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
You had to sit on the couch and watch them play

2393
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
Or if you wanted to see streaming

2394
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
You had to do it through a VHS tape

2395
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
If you wanted to see streaming you went to the lake

2396
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
Alright

2397
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
It is the classic game of the week

2398
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
Every week Dark Sakura steps into the gaming vault

2399
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
And finds a game that she thinks

2400
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
Hey brat

2401
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
Get off my lawn and play this game

2402
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
Get off my lawn, get off twitch

2403
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
Sit down, blow on this cartridge

2404
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
And check this game out

2405
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
Dark Sakura what is the classic game of the week

2406
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
The classic game of the week is Adventures of Lolo

2407
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
Which I think Dan suggested as a joke

2408
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
But it actually was kind of fun

2409
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
This game was great

2410
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
It had good music

2411
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
Why would you suggest it as a joke

2412
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
I was just like pick something Dan

2413
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
He's like I don't know Adventure Lolo

2414
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
I'm like okay sure

2415
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
Here's the music

2416
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
Even Loki's head bobbing a little bit

2417
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
I play this game

2418
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
I know I used to love this game

2419
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
It is a great game

2420
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
Anyway in the Adventures of Lolo

2421
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
Basically his sweetie Lala

2422
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
Is captured by the villain

2423
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
King Egger

2424
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
So Lolo's like bitch you give me back my woman

2425
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
And he watches right up to the castle

2426
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
And kicks the door down

2427
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
And says I'm not taking your shit

2428
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
You know I don't seem to remember it going that way

2429
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
That's my version so much

2430
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
The Dark Sakura version

2431
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
And then he sets the castle on fire

2432
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
Yeah

2433
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
And then he and Lolo

2434
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
Make little round babies

2435
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
Lala

2436
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
Somehow Lolo became

2437
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
Gay in your version

2438
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
Would that be

2439
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
Auto-gay

2440
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
And that's how

2441
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
Kirby was made

2442
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
God

2443
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
We're going to break

2444
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
I'm done

2445
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
So yeah you basically go through the stages

2446
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
You get harder and harder

2447
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
Every four rooms you get to go upwards

2448
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
Closer to his victory

2449
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
His sweet sweet victory

2450
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
And if you get stuck on a stage

2451
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
You have the option of dying

2452
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
Which was great

2453
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
God dammit death

2454
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
So you commit suicide when you're done with life

2455
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
SSG100Matt in our chatroom at live.vognitework.com

2456
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
Says Lolo the game with its own suicide button

2457
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
Exactly

2458
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
So you can destroy the enemies

2459
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
And shoot at them and you turn them into movable eggs

2460
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
And when you shoot the egg

2461
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
It disappears

2462
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
Now the game was produced

2463
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
I'm sorry developed by HAL Laboratory

2464
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
And published by HAL America

2465
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
For the NES

2466
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
And it came out on April 20th

2467
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
The day after my birthday

2468
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
Remember it everybody and get me stuff

2469
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
420 it's not hard to remember

2470
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
In 1989

2471
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
And it came out in Europe in February 1991

2472
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
So they had to wait two whole years for Lolo

2473
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
It is now out

2474
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
On Wii's Virtual Console

2475
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
As of June 8th, 2007

2476
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
And August 6th, 2007 in the PAL regions

2477
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
It is the only game

2478
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
In the series not to have come out in Japan

2479
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
However Lolo 2 and Lolo 3 did

2480
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
It's just a fun little adventure game

2481
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
It's cute

2482
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
It gets kind of frustrating

2483
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
Later on

2484
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
But it's a fun game

2485
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
And it's one that's pretty much held up

2486
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
I played probably more of Lolo 2

2487
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
Than the first one

2488
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
Or the third one

2489
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
Because by the third one it came out I was like I don't care

2490
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
But I always had fun with it

2491
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
I've always loved little

2492
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
Spatial puzzle games like that

2493
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
You know the little enemies running around

2494
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
Well like your gaming week you've been playing Bejeweled and

2495
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
Fractal it's a bunch of the same type of

2496
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
Puzzle games

2497
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
I fucking love Fractal

2498
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
I wish it was 10 years later

2499
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
So I could do Fractal

2500
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
As my classic game

2501
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
It's like instant fucking classic you have no idea

2502
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
Going back to Lolo and Lala

2503
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
It's a fun game

2504
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
I mean basically

2505
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
Like I said Lolo 2 and Lolo 3

2506
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
Came out in 90 and 91 respectively

2507
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
There's a Game Boy version that came out in 1994

2508
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
That came out

2509
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
With the same name Adventures of Lolo

2510
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
In Japan it came out as Lolo no

2511
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
No

2512
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
Lolo no Daibouken

2513
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
Lolo and Lala did appear

2514
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
In Kirby's Dreamland Rob

2515
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
And in Kirby Superstar

2516
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
As Lolo and Lala

2517
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
And in Kirby's Avalanche

2518
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
As Lolo and Lala where they are antagonists

2519
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
I thought it was funny

2520
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
That you were making the Kirby joke earlier

2521
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
But act deaf yeah I was bringing up that same thing in our chat room

2522
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
And it was making me think as well

2523
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
I was like well yeah both these games were made

2524
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
Both Kirby and Lolo were HAL laboratories

2525
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
And if you think about it too

2526
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
I always thought that the little

2527
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
Blue critter in

2528
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
Guardian Legend was Lolo

2529
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
Yes but it's

2530
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
It's not

2531
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
It's from that shooter game

2532
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
Not Xanax

2533
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
I keep thinking like Xanax

2534
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
Is it Xanax?

2535
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
Yeah I think it's Xanax

2536
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
The little lunar lander

2537
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
Yeah that's what I thought

2538
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
But before I was familiar with Xanax

2539
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
I often thought that it was

2540
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
Lolo

2541
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
I mean I guess having a blue puff ball

2542
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
With legs you know

2543
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
You can't get too uh

2544
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
Too far away from that so

2545
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
So anyway that's uh

2546
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
According to act deaf they also appeared in the Kirby anime

2547
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
So yay

2548
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
So are you

2549
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
Oh you're looking it up?

2550
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
Well I'm trying to remember what that little thing was called

2551
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
And somebody in the chat room

2552
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
What is the name of the little blue fucker?

2553
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
I don't know how to spell Xanax that's why

2554
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
It's Z-A-M-A-C

2555
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
That was the game

2556
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
What was that little fucker called?

2557
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
Yeah his name was little fucker

2558
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
It was, that's Lolo and Lala's

2559
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
True uh, that's Lolo's love child

2560
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
They're twins I swear to god

2561
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
But they're from different companies cause Xanax was an

2562
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
FCI game

2563
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
Or compile, it was compile

2564
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
But FCI published it

2565
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
Wasn't FCI like the publisher?

2566
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
Or was compile, compile was the developer

2567
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
Compile developed, FCI published

2568
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
In North America

2569
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
In Japan Xanax was published by

2570
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
Pony Canyon, but you know what the segment is about

2571
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
That's what Pony Canyon has done

2572
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
PORN

2573
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
At least they're not pink pineapple

2574
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
You know

2575
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
You were talking about the classic game of the week

2576
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
Adventures of Lolo and now we're talking about

2577
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
PORN

2578
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
Only here at Orange Lones area

2579
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
Well I'm sure somewhere there's a Lolo shaped vibrator or something

2580
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
I don't know

2581
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
This is after you made Lolo gay and set the castle on fire

2582
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
No! Auto gay

2583
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
Alright whatever

2584
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
He is only, he's uh

2585
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
Self sexual

2586
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
Or would it be auto sexual?

2587
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
Are you done?

2588
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
I'm trying to think of what the politically correct term would be now

2589
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
I think it's auto sexual

2590
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
I'm gonna be thinking about this all during the break

2591
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
I just love that it's to this music

2592
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
PORN

2593
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
PORN

2594
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
PORN

2595
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
Hey this is a wonderful clip for the highlight show

2596
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000

2597
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
Alright

2598
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
Cause I wouldn't have thought up all this fucked up shit if not for you

2599
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
I love you too are you fucking done?

2600
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
I'm fucking done god damn it

2601
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
The classic game of the week

2602
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
I think it was Adventures of Lolo

2603
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
But it might have been Xanac

2604
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
So

2605
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
It's always the guardian legend every episode

2606
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
Alright that's it

2607
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
We're gonna take a break

2608
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
Yes I agree with Queen Simia

2609
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
Just narcissistic

2610
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
Stay classy part A

2611
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
Live.vognetwork.com

2612
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
Alright and what's this?

2613
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
Dark Tetsuya says wow it took an hour and a half

2614
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
To get to the porn talk. Sit down be quiet

2615
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
Alright we're gonna take a quick break

2616
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
Guys when we come back we have plenty more of

2617
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000

2618
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000

2621
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
When we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio

2622
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
Right after this

2623
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:42,000
Music

2624
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
Welcome back everybody to Orange

2625
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
Lounge Radio we are

2626
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
live on this Sunday night October

2627
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
the 20th of 2013 with the

2628
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
524th episode

2629
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
of our show you know next week

2630
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
that means it's episode 525

2631
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
which might mean something

2632
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
but cause it's a multiple of 25

2633
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
and it's a palindrome

2634
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
but I guess we don't really do anything to celebrate

2635
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
I don't know what else to do

2636
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
it would be the Halloween show

2637
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
I would say we could do like a specially themed Halloween show

2638
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
but we never have so why start now

2639
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
I don't know

2640
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
what would we do

2641
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
sit here and play Silent Hill during the show

2642
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
I don't know if that would be as effective

2643
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
alright go to our channel

2644
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,000
live.vognetwork.com some people

2645
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
guessing the songs we were playing during the break

2646
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
now for you folks listening on the podcast

2647
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000

2648
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
we played during break but tonight for the

2649
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
live participants I promised some obscure

2650
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
stuff cause I didn't want to just play like

2651
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
Mega Man and Zelda and all the stuff

2652
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
you guys know but I did some

2653
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
slightly obscure stuff tonight and for

2654
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
those playing at home like if you're not in chat

2655
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
but you are listening live you had Terranigma

2656
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
started that off the middle

2657
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
song nobody got that's because it was from

2658
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
Cold Sept which was the

2659
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
that was that card battle game meets Monopoly

2660
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
I should have noticed that because you know I remember

2661
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
you playing that game yeah I'm like the one guy

2662
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
that liked that game and then the

2663
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
third song that we played tonight was from

2664
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
Intelligent Cube or IQ

2665
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
remember that on the Playstation 1

2666
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
there you go those are the songs we had there

2667
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000

2671
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
I didn't see anybody else really shout things out there

2672
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
let's see

2673
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000

2674
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
before we get back into the news here

2675
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000

2701
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
troop here does that for Repo the genetic opera

2702
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
with the movie that's pretty awesome

2703
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
and then I was looking actually another

2704
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
big stage show this time of year the Rocky Horror

2705
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
show and that was also brought

2706
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
up during the break is that Rageinator said

2707
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
he found this game that has my

2708
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
name written all over it it's the actual

2709
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
Rocky Horror video game that they

2710
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
made there was actually two I don't know if you guys know this

2711
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
there were two Rocky Horror show games

2712
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
neither were the picture show

2713
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
I think they're both based on the play the first

2714
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
one was like on the Commodore 64

2715
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
and Apple 2e it was kind of like an adventure

2716
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
game where you walk around and you're trying to find like the

2717
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
transducer or something you can play as Brad or Janet

2718
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
it's not good it's really not good

2719
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
like there's a reason why most people

2720
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
telltale games should do an adventure

2721
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
game based on it wouldn't that be something

2722
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
well in the 90s the late 90s

2723
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
there was a revival of Rocky

2724
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
Horror show

2725
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
in London yes and they did

2726
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
a CD-ROM game

2727
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
inspired by the 80s classic

2728
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
that went with that and it also

2729
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
wasn't very good because it was inspired

2730
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
by the 80s classic which in turn

2731
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
that was not good the one with the blonde Frank

2732
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
yes yeah yeah because

2733
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
not everybody wants to look like Tim Curry necessarily

2734
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
for the record before I

2735
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
forget coming up in a couple of

2736
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
weeks at my college

2737
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
there's going to be another production of the Rocky Horror show

2738
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
oh really it's a touring production

2739
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
I'll get the info for you I sent you the hairspray

2740
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
one this is the time if you're going to

2741
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
time warp now's the time to do it I did also send you one

2742
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
for hairspray I do remember seeing that

2743
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
that's right I know how you love

2744
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
John Waters things alright I do love John Waters

2745
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
things but like let's be real they're never

2746
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
going to do Pink Flamingos live unless it involves

2747
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
unless it involves drag queens

2748
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
which then anything goes

2749
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
right maybe we can write to

2750
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
Peaches Christ alright maybe

2751
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
I'm sure I'm sure

2752
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
she's done some John Waters movie

2753
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
but anyway this is not a show

2754
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
about John Waters films as badly

2755
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
as I wish it was sometimes this

2756
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
is a show about video games and we have some

2757
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
rapid fire news to get to

2758
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
sadly no John Waters movies being made into

2759
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
video games but I think there's some other stuff

2760
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
um so yeah there's

2761
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
been some news regarding the Oculus

2762
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
Rift um the consumer version

2763
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
of the Oculus Rift

2764
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
still no firm date on that

2765
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
yet but it's supposed to be out sometime

2766
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
next year um

2767
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
one of the other things they're looking at is maybe in the future

2768
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
also switching those displays

2769
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
that are inside of it to 4K displays

2770
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
so that would probably look pretty realistic

2771
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
especially for some PC games

2772
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
um so that's pretty exciting

2773
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
um

2774
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
anyways

2775
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
there's a brand new game from one of the

2776
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
um designers that used to

2777
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
work at Harmonix and it's

2778
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
kind of silly it's actually uh this

2779
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
indie studio called No Goblin

2780
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
and they have a game called

2781
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
Roundabout and Roundabout's basically

2782
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
this limo driving game where

2783
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
you're a chauffeur of a limo and you have to get through

2784
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
busy streets but the limo is always

2785
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
spinning and so you have to

2786
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
dodge traffic you do

2787
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
run over a lot of people to like do different

2788
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
things like you know deliver kittens

2789
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
to orphans or you know

2790
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
uh run over the orphans on the way

2791
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
why does that why am I

2792
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
reminded of that the kittens are safe

2793
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
why am I reminded of that no breaks

2794
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
valet game it's sort of the only

2795
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
thing to play on the Ouya it's sort of like an evolution

2796
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
yeah of that

2797
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
or revolution if you will

2798
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
uh it looks

2799
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
it looks silly and um

2800
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
I don't know I think that

2801
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
yeah it's it's due out next

2802
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
year um although they're taking

2803
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
pre-orders for it right now at ten dollars

2804
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
normally it's gonna be fifteen and that includes a digital

2805
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
art book and soundtrack and

2806
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
I guess it's like seventies themed as well it's set in

2807
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
1977

2808
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
um it looks funny

2809
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
so yeah definitely check that

2810
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
video if you haven't seen it yet and

2811
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
uh last but not least there's a brand

2812
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
new Minecraft mod and

2813
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
it's involved or involving

2814
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
quantum physics it's uh

2815
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
called Qcraft

2816
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,000
and allows I guess

2817
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
players to do different things including like um

2818
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
they have different blocks with quantum

2819
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
entanglements um

2820
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
I guess they're saying that uh

2821
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
observer dependency characteristics

2822
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
see this is all stuff that's

2823
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
over my head um

2824
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
cool

2825
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
I don't really know what exactly that means since

2826
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
I'm not really into quantum physics but uh

2827
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
I like Minecraft

2828
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
mods so let's let's dabble

2829
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
with that

2830
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
alright why not

2831
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
Minecraft will be one of the

2832
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
launch games on Playstation 4 right?

2833
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
yeah that is kind of neat

2834
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
so quantum physics in uh

2835
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
Playstation 4 maybe?

2836
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
alright let's go on to some other news stories

2837
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
uh Pokémon X and Y I talked about earlier

2838
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
in the show my first uh couple

2839
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
couple hours in that world well some people

2840
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
some people already beat the game

2841
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
Shane if you're out there listening

2842
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
and others I think ActDeft was saying he was on the

2843
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
final four well there was a lot of

2844
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
people there was a lot of people playing X and Y

2845
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
over four million copies in

2846
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,000
two days moved of Pokémon X and Y

2847
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
Nintendo's going

2848
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
bankrupt you guys the Wii U's gonna

2849
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
bankrupt Nintendo everybody

2850
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
they're gonna be making games

2851
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
for the Playstation 99 cent iPhone

2852
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
games y'all

2853
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
yeah four million copies

2854
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
of Pokémon X and Y it's just these

2855
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
games print money there they go

2856
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
and uh yeah uh they say

2857
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
by the way that Pokémon X and Y tracking

2858
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
ahead of Pokémon White 2

2859
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
and Black 2 by more than 70%

2860
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
well that's because White 2

2861
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
and Black 2 were obvious cash-ins this

2862
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
at least is a little more you know effort of a

2863
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
cash-in let's be real alright

2864
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
uh other stuff I love that

2865
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000

01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
tab because I stopped caring I'm gonna buy

2895
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
I'm gonna buy it anyway

2896
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
okay calm down

2897
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
calm your tits calm

2898
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
them alright soccer

2899
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
is freaking out because we have

2900
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
another story this is two weeks in a row now we're

2901
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
talking about ColecoVision

2902
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,000
because last week we

2903
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,000
talked about that whole Kickstarter thing

2904
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
and I kind of said my

2905
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,000
honest piece that I don't think they're gonna make their funding

2906
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,000
but you know I hope prove me

2907
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
wrong please do I would not be sad

2908
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,000
however we have something else this is different

2909
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
this is a different retro device

2910
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
that's gonna bring back the ColecoVision

2911
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
it's a retro hardware company

2912
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
called AtGames and they're

2913
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
gonna be launching these devices that are based on the

2914
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
ColecoVision they already make Atari

2915
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
and Sega Genesis based handhelds so

2916
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
I'm assuming these are those shitty

2917
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
little plug and play things you

2918
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
see just littering one of the aisles

2919
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
at Target right so soon you're gonna have a

2920
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,000
shitty little ColecoVision thing too

2921
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,000
but you know it won't be shitty because it's ColecoVision

2922
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
I love my ColecoVision Rob

2923
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
uh so there's that

2924
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
so that is coming I guess soon all we know

2925
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,000
they've acquired the rights

2926
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,000
that they've got the deal we just don't know

2927
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,000
when we don't know how but you can

2928
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
assume soon I

2929
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
would think they're trying to get this on the shelves before the holiday

2930
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,000
because you've got you know people in

2931
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
their mid 30s like Darsakra and me

2932
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
who remember this shit from when

2933
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
we were kids and it would be a great

2934
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,000
thing to find you know under

2935
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
the Christmas tree or menorah or whatever

2936
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,000
under the menorah yeah there's a

2937
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
menorah on top of a ColecoVision isn't that where

2938
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,000
you put the gifts

2939
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
that's how it works right where else are

2940
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,000
they supposed to go no no

2941
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
you have the Hanukkah bush

2942
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
the gelt goes in my belly

2943
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
you know what though

2944
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,000
it is kind of funny that Hanukkah

2945
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,000
is the same week that Thanksgiving is

2946
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
so I'm gonna make sweet potato pumpkin

2947
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,000
latkes oh my god Hanukkah is that early this year

2948
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,000
I know it's because

2949
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
see they don't believe in solar calendars and

2950
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
Judaism back in ancient

2951
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,000
Israel we had the moon

2952
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,000
stop complicating everything

2953
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,000
you know what I didn't invent

2954
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
I didn't invent the lunar calendar

2955
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,000
these guys are just high maintenance that's what it really is

2956
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
high maintenance

2957
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,000
and I say that with love put the

2958
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
angry emails down I tease because I love

2959
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,000
I tell you what was absolutely hilarious was

2960
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
when Christmas and Hanukkah were the same week

2961
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
it was a nightmare in my house

2962
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,000
because we were also moving

2963
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,000
we had

2964
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,000
blue stars and Christmas

2965
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
presents everywhere so once in a while there's video game

2966
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
talk on this show

2967
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
Darsakra

2968
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
oh yeah I got stories

2969
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000
well how about

2970
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,000
a petition that is out

2971
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,000
for the Grand Theft Auto 5 PC

2972
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,000
version and it's at

2973
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,000
change.org so you know it's an annoying piece of shit

2974
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,000
however

2975
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,000
you know what my problem with

2976
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,000
change.org is all the damn emails

2977
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,000
so anyway

2978
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,000
they are over

2979
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
600,000 supporters

2980
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,000
to have a PC version released

2981
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000
and they have generated

2982
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
as far as

2983
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,000
the sales of the game goes

2984
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,000
over a billion what was it in three days

2985
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,000
so yeah it's made quite a bit of money

2986
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,000
so there are also

2987
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,000
sources in the industry saying that there should be a PC

2988
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
version out early 2014

2989
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,000
I was going to say

2990
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,000
they're already making a PC version

2991
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
they just haven't announced it yet because why would they cannibalize

2992
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,000
the sales of the current versions

2993
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,000
because people like to jump on bandwagon

2994
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,000
especially if they know it's

2995
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,000
going to happen

2996
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,000
who doesn't like to come back and say

2997
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,000
I was right

2998
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,000
I totally called that

2999
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
you guys I totally called that

3000
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,000
how about all of us who said we totally called it without

3001
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,000
signing a fucking petition

3002
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,000
they're going to make Grand Theft Auto 6 you guys

3003
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,000
I fucking called it here on OLR

3004
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,000
also if you happen

3005
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,000
to pre-order

3006
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,000
Zelda A Link Between Worlds

3007
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,000
you get a musical chest

3008
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,000
it comes in a nice big box

3009
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
now granted

3010
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,000
this is

3011
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,000
just for the US

3012
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,000
this is buying the bundle version

3013
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,000
the 3DS XL that comes with the game

3014
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,000
it has

3015
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,000
a golden Triforce cover

3016
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,000
and A Link Between Worlds loaded on the console

3017
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:54,000
and this was

3018
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,000
already linked

3019
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,000
from a

3020
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
Gamestop Black Friday ad

3021
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
so as far as

3022
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,000
any type of European release

3023
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
Game actually did confirm

3024
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,000
that they're getting the

3025
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,000
musical treasure chest as a pre-order bonus

3026
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,000
so all of our friends

3027
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:14,000
in the UK you're not screwed

3028
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,000
this time

3029
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,000
and

3030
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,000
well

3031
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,000
I don't know if I'm happy or sad Rob

3032
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:24,000
because

3033
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,000
well you're always happy to be in my presence

3034
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,000
I know that

3035
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,000
you know what

3036
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,000
we have a little bit more news about the Mass Effect franchise

3037
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,000
that will have a brand new story

3038
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,000
completely unrelated to

3039
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,000
The Shepherd or The Crew

3040
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,000
or

3041
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,000
any of them

3042
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,000
so basically Bioware wants to take it in a new

3043
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:46,000
direction

3044
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:48,000
and they have said again

3045
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,000
doesn't necessarily relate to The Shepherd

3046
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
events whatsoever

3047
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
but it has to be

3048
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,000
Mass Effect Universe it's not just a spin-off

3049
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:58,000
it has to be a part of the series

3050
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,000
so

3051
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,000
but they said something similar

3052
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,000
6 months ago and we all

3053
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,000
accept it then right?

3054
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,000
yeah

3055
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,000
I don't know how I feel because

3056
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,000
you know I used to back in the day I used to want

3057
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,000
a Mass Effect MMO I thought it would be

3058
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,000
fantastic to play in that universe

3059
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,000
to go around and hang out on the

3060
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,000
different worlds and do stuff and maybe if it was something

3061
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,000
kinda

3062
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,000
kinda more like that

3063
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,000
where it wasn't just all the human centric

3064
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
bullshit that was you know Mass Effect 3

3065
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,000
then I would be completely

3066
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,000
okay with that but at this point

3067
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,000
I don't necessarily trust what Bioware

3068
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:36,000
is going to do so I'm probably

3069
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,000
still gonna buy it because I'm a whore

3070
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,000
sigh

3071
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,000
I don't know

3072
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,000
alright

3073
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:46,000
I'm still looking forward to it

3074
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:48,000
because you know it's Mass Effect and

3075
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,000
it'll be great you know what I want

3076
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,000
Turians the game

3077
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,000
Queen Simeon is in our chatroom

3078
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,000
at live.vognetwork.com and says still needs

3079
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:58,000
Turians and Krogan

3080
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,000
Alan Alchemy says it can't

3081
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,000
be a sequel that takes place in the

3082
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,000
same universe unless it's literally thousands

3083
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,000
of years later because otherwise they'll have to

3084
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,000
pick a canon ending between the red blue

3085
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:10,000
green horse shit and that would be bad

3086
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,000
well they did pick a canon ending

3087
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,000
for part 2 didn't they

3088
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:16,000
you wouldn't have had a 3 if they went with a bad ending

3089
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,000
and 2 everyone dies

3090
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,000
oh my god have you watched that

3091
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,000
oh yeah it's great it's hilarious I mean it's sad

3092
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,000
but it's hilarious the YouTube of the

3093
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,000
Mass Effect 2 bad ending or whatever which is

3094
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:28,000
the everybody dies ending OMG spoilers

3095
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,000
for a 4 year old game

3096
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,000
they have the shepherd the thing that makes

3097
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,000
that video funny is they have like the ugliest shepherd

3098
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:36,000
possible at least the one I saw

3099
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,000
have you seen the the ones that

3100
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,000
that have hacked it to give shepherd

3101
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,000
garris a skeleton

3102
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,000
yes that was creepy

3103
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:46,000
there's another one that did that to give Jacob

3104
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:48,000
garris a skeleton and they just got this huge mouth

3105
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:50,000
it's so fucking weird

3106
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,000
um and

3107
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:54,000
yeah raginator asks so no

3108
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,000
more garris they

3109
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,000
won't garris all the things I won't garris

3110
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,000
all the things does this make dark sakura

3111
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,000
a sad panda dark sakura is kind of getting

3112
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,000
over some of her attachment in the

3113
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:06,000
fandom so and also speaking

3114
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,000
of herself in the third person

3115
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,000
so at this point I would actually

3116
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,000
like a new series that has

3117
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,000
characters that I'm attached to but not like

3118
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,000
singularly attached to I would like

3119
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,000
to be able to explore more options

3120
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,000
instead of having just the one freaking awesome option

3121
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,000
so

3122
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,000
alright I'm sorry I wasn't into

3123
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,000

clicker is a free to play web game that has been found

3147
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:14,000
to be pretty addicting for some and it's

3148
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,000
inspired parodies like I don't know if you saw but

3149
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,000
there's a clicking bad

3150
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:20,000
which is it replaces cookie clickers with

3151
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,000
bad references so you're cooking meth

3152
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,000

fun flash game on disney.com based on

3174
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,000
their version of tarzan many years ago

3175
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,000
it was really fluid and fun to play I was a kid

3176
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,000
but I'd still go back and play it now

3177
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,000

are a few free to play games I've enjoyed over the years

3180
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,000
but the best one being the kingdom

01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,000
of loathing simple interface

3182
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:24,000
much like clicking bad but totally

3183
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:26,000
aloof and light hearted fantasy story

3184
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:28,000
especially when you can be a

3185
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:30,000
pasta mancer or a saucer roar

3186
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:32,000

played the kingdom of loathing for a hot minute like I

3188

01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,000
facebook I was fairly addicted to

3249
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,000

3250
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:46,000

01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:58,000
it's not exactly the same thing and this answer really

3257
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:00,000
doesn't fit the question but the closest thing that sorts

3258
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,000
of fits is pc gaming in general be it

3259
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:04,000
on steam game for windows live or whatever

3260
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:06,000
and the vod community already well knows

3261
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:08,000
I've traditionally been a console gamer and a console

3262
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:10,000
gaming fanboy since 1981

3263
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:12,000
and for the longest time would have scoffed

3264
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:14,000
the idea of pc gaming it wasn't

3265
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:16,000
until the theft last year on my original laptop

3266
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:18,000
my ps3 and tv that I

3267
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:20,000
got into pc gaming albeit

3268
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:22,000
begrudgingly if only because I couldn't afford to replace

3269
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,000
my tv and ps3 now

3270
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:26,000
I thoroughly enjoy pc gaming

3271
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:28,000
well raginator go check out some of these links people

3272
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:30,000
are leaving and you can fill up your pc with

3273
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,000
crap

3274
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:34,000
uh austin s says

3275
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,000
oh and I'm sure we've all played this one being music game

3276
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:38,000
fans we are ffr

3277
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:40,000
flash flash revolution it was a web

3278
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:42,000
based step mania game I used

3279
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:44,000
to play it a lot back in the day but it's dated now

3280
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:46,000
fair enough

3281
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,000
alright let's go on to google plus

3282
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,000
we have a couple answers there

3283
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:52,000
actdeft says mostly facebook

3284
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:54,000
games I used to play them a lot but I

3285
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:56,000
eventually got tired of them like song pop or even

3286
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:58,000
you don't know jack I do play the occasional

3287
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:00,000
bejeweled bullets and tenders friends

3288
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,000
and lastly

3289
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:04,000
rettertainment says yes the sims on facebook

3290
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,000
I never spent a cent on it and got

3291
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:08,000
really far in it until I got a girlfriend

3292
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:10,000
and started having sex in the game

3293
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,000
then I got oddly disinterested

3294
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:14,000
weird I also started playing

3295
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:16,000
the sims freeplay on my ipad until I found

3296
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:18,000
that I couldn't play it at work because I wasn't connected to the internet

3297
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:20,000
that's stupid the game

3298
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:22,000
is downloaded on my ipad and the file size is

3299
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:24,000
mighty large why can't my save be

3300
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:26,000
on the ipad as well

3301
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,000
I guess because it's harder to take your money

3302
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:30,000
if you're not connected to the internet

3303
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,000
alright bye erasure

3304
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,000
I'll miss you

3305
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:36,000
you totally should use this every time

3306
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,000
for the segment now I kind of want to

3307
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,000
alright there it is our frugal

3308
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,000
question of the week I'll quickly

3309
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:44,000
ask are there any free to play games

3310
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:46,000
maybe that weren't brought up that you've been getting into

3311
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:48,000
lately or even in the past

3312
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,000
cookie clicker is definitely mine they have

3313
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,000
an iphone it's not official though

3314
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:54,000
it's a follow up to horde house

3315
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,000
the iphone one is cookie

3316
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,000
clickers and it's a

3317
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:00,000
knock off game it's still pretty good

3318
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,000
but it's not official there is an official one

3319
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:04,000
in the making just to say

3320
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,000
I can't remember really

3321
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,000
the last free one that I did

3322
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:10,000
because remember

3323
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:12,000
when I got my ikade

3324
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,000
I kind of went on a purchasing spree

3325
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,000
which I probably shouldn't have done

3326
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:18,000
oops

3327
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:20,000
yeah all the ones

3328
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:22,000
that I actually still have on my phone

3329
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:24,000
are

3330
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,000
ones I paid for

3331
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:28,000
I mean I'm actually looking at

3332
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:30,000
my folder now

3333
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:32,000
I have a robot

3334
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:34,000
unicorn and I played for that

3335
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:36,000
droplets I paid for that

3336
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:38,000
yeah everything

3337
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:40,000
on here I paid for

3338
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:42,000
so no nothing free

3339
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:44,000
Loki what about you

3340
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:46,000
I don't think there's really been anything that I've played

3341
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:48,000
for free aside from that time

3342
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:50,000
when I was doing the whole ready

3343
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,000
player one thing where I had to play that really shitty

3344
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,000
garage sale

3345
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:56,000
game on Facebook

3346
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:58,000
oh god but I didn't necessarily

3347
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:00,000
want to play that it was

3348
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,000
did that guy really win that DeLorean or whatever

3349
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:04,000
yeah he did there was a guy that won the DeLorean

3350
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:06,000
because he got

3351
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,000
the world record in Joust

3352
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,000
I think of the 2600 wow

3353
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,000
alright grats to him I guess

3354
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:14,000
alright more

3355
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,000
stories coming your way up now Loki

3356
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:18,000
yeah no

3357
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:20,000
no DeLorean for me that's right

3358
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,000
it probably would have been more

3359
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:24,000
you wouldn't have wanted to

3360
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:26,000
pay the taxes on it

3361
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:28,000
well the taxes and then on top of that

3362
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:30,000
servicing the thing the only service center that

3363
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:32,000
does DeLoreans

3364
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:34,000
at least around here is in LA

3365
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:36,000
so that wouldn't be very convenient

3366
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:38,000
um okay

3367
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:40,000
so let's talk a little bit about the PlayStation 4

3368
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,000
hey you want to check out a PlayStation

3369
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,000
4 well there's going to be some demo kiosks

3370
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:46,000
coming soon to

3371
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:48,000
Sony stores, GameStop, Target

3372
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:50,000
Walmart and Best Buy

3373
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,000
and uh

3374
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:54,000
they have a website that you can actually go to

3375
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:56,000
to see where they are at if

3376
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,000
you go to it's the experience

3377
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:00,000
playstation.com and

3378
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,000
you put in your zip code and they'll show

3379
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:04,000
you a map with all the different

3380
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:06,000
stores that are

3381
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:08,000
you know supplying it

3382
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:10,000
and um

3383
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:12,000
we have none there is absolutely

3384
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:14,000
none in our area so I noticed

3385
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:16,000
Best Buy is making a lot of room for both the

3386
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:18,000
PlayStation 4 and the Xbox although on the whole

3387
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:20,000
on the whole it seems like Best Buy

3388
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:22,000
has really scaled back their gaming sections

3389
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:24,000
I guess in

3390
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:26,000
favor of other stuff and some of the things

3391
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:28,000
we've been hearing about the company you know on

3392
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:30,000
CNN or other new sites where the margins

3393
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:32,000
are bigger cause gaming isn't it

3394
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:34,000
that's for sure I guess so

3395
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:36,000
so yeah and then

3396
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:38,000
it's a little

3397
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:40,000
I don't understand this

3398
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:42,000
to be honest and this is basically

3399
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:44,000
you can pre-order

3400
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:46,000
digital downloads of

3401
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:48,000
PlayStation 4 launch titles

3402
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:50,000
look if you're willing to give them your

3403
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:52,000
credit card they'll take it on the

3404
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:54,000
PlayStation 3 and

3405
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:56,000
guess what you get for doing that

3406
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:58,000
no discount

3407
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:00,000
so why the

3408
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:02,000
fuck would you do that because you want

3409
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:04,000
to be able to play that shit day one

3410
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:06,000
even though if you're gonna have to

3411
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:08,000
go and download it anyways so

3412
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:10,000
go and pick up your PlayStation 4 somewhere unless

3413
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:12,000
Amazon's bringing it to you let's put it this way

3414
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:14,000
ok yeah I know that you can partially download

3415
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:16,000
the game and then you can start playing it

3416
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:18,000
once you've downloaded the game but

3417
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:20,000
the thing is these

3418
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:22,000
downloads are fucking huge remember we

3419
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:24,000
mentioned on a couple shows back they had

3420
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:26,000
this NBA Ultimate

3421
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:28,000
Fan Pack or Super Fan Pack

3422
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:30,000
or something like that it's basically digital versions of the

3423
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:32,000
current gen and next gen versions of the game

3424
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:34,000
the next gen versions of the game

3425
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:36,000
were like 60 gigabytes to download

3426
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:38,000
and I'm

3427
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:40,000
sorry but there's

3428
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:42,000
you want to do that just go to retail

3429
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,000
and buy the game yeah you may have to pay taxes

3430
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:46,000
on it but just go

3431
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:48,000
buy it or hey here's a wonderful

3432
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:50,000
idea maybe wait until Black Friday and see if they

3433
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:52,000
discount that shit

3434
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:54,000
might be something you know

3435
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:56,000
I don't know there's just no reason

3436
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:58,000
I can see the pre-order

3437
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,000
a game unless you get something

3438
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:02,000
I mean cause so far they haven't really said

3439
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:04,000
anything it says I guess the only

3440
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:06,000
game that you can pre-order that seems like you get

3441
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:08,000
something for is

3442
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:10,000
Warframe which is free

3443
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:12,000
so I don't understand that at all

3444
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:14,000
but it's free and I guess you get some

3445
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:16,000
in-game money and exclusive weapon skin

3446
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:18,000
so sure why not go pre-order that if you're

3447
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:20,000
going to give it to PlayStation 4

3448
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:22,000
in case you want to play it cause it's free so

3449
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:24,000
but as far as

3450
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:26,000
Nack you know

3451
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:28,000
Killzone or something like that

3452
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:30,000
unless there's charge I mean like

3453
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:32,000
you know $53.99 or

3454
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:34,000
some sort of discount there I just don't see

3455
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:36,000
a reason to pre-order

3456
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:38,000
anything for a

3457
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:40,000
digital download I mean

3458
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:42,000
fuck if you want to do a digital download

3459
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:44,000
and you decide that you want to do that

3460
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:46,000
do it at launch day make that decision on launch day

3461
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:48,000
not necessarily

3462
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:50,000
Well it just goes back to that old thing we were talking about

3463
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:52,000
way back when the Xbox One was rumored to have

3464
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:54,000
all these restrictions it's like what's the benefit

3465
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:56,000
of going digital? It's not like they're not going to have

3466
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:58,000
a digital copy for you it's not like

3467
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:00,000
they're going to sell out a digital copy

3468
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:02,000
of a game I mean

3469
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:04,000
it just doesn't make any sense

3470
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:06,000
Alright they just want

3471
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:08,000
a really easy way for you to hit the button

3472
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:10,000
and they can charge the card and give you

3473
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:12,000
make another sale really easy

3474
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:14,000
that's what this is all about nothing more

3475
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:16,000
I think you're thinking too much about it

3476
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:18,000
Logie

3477
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:20,000
Alright well this game fell off

3478
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:22,000
our radar years ago and

3479
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:24,000
the last time we were talking about this video game

3480
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:26,000
I think we were exclusively a show about

3481
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:28,000
music based video games

3482
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:30,000
this game was being developed for an arcade

3483
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:32,000
release in 2005

3484
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:34,000
I don't know if you guys remember when we were talking about

3485
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:36,000
a game called Neon FM

3486
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:38,000
remember this? Because it had

3487
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:40,000
like freeze pop and it had some really other

3488
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:42,000
like kind of questionably

3489
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:44,000
good songs in it well it's been a

3490
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:46,000
long time obviously and this game has kind of

3491
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:48,000
reinvented itself a little bit because

3492
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:50,000
Unit E is the

3493
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:52,000
group now that's putting this arcade cabinet out

3494
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:54,000
I think I heard a rumor once that at one point

3495
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:56,000
Betson who ended up doing the DDR

3496
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:58,000
cabinets years later was going to do this

3497
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:00,000
game and they didn't so now Unit E

3498
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:02,000
is doing this and it's no longer

3499
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:04,000
a dance game that's the other big change

3500
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:06,000
it is now a I guess

3501
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:08,000
to me it would strike me more as like pop

3502
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:10,000
music because it's got the big

3503
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:12,000
circular pads that you hit

3504
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:14,000
it was originally supposed to be played

3505
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:16,000
the same way except the dance pad would look like

3506
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:18,000
what that pad looks like right there

3507
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:20,000
it was like 3 on the bottom 2 on the top it wasn't

3508
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:22,000
like your typical DDR dance pad

3509
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:24,000
it was like Beatmania with your feet

3510
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:26,000
right

3511
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:28,000
so yeah so Neon FM

3512
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:30,000
is apparently now like a thing

3513
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:32,000
there's a video out there you can

3514
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:34,000
see it on YouTube and so forth

3515
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:36,000
but is girls

3516
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:38,000
butts in it and it is because I can see

3517
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:40,000
that in the screenshot apparently it is

3518
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:42,000
the song is so

3519
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:44,000
awful that song is horrible

3520
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:46,000
but I think by now it probably gets the joke

3521
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:48,000
vote right no

3522
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:50,000
it's still awful so apparently

3523
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:52,000
it is still on target for release this

3524
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:54,000
year to show up in arcades

3525
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:56,000
that is if you still have an arcade near

3526
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:58,000
you that contains games that don't shoot

3527
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:00,000
out tickets I will say the cabinet

3528
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:02,000
does look nice I hope this does show up in an arcade

3529
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:04,000
you know what the best ticket game ever is

3530
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:06,000
Giant Tetris

3531
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:08,000
I would say either Spider Stomp or

3532
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:10,000
Giant Tetris no the one where

3533
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:12,000
you have those little like the balls that

3534
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:14,000
you see in the McDonald's ball pit or whatever and you

3535
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:16,000
throw them at the screen and break things on the monitor

3536
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:18,000
ok that is pretty cool that one is a lot of fun too

3537
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:20,000
because it involves breaking shit but I still love

3538
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:22,000
Giant Tetris Giant Tetris is like a close

3539
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:24,000
second yeah

3540
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:26,000
but Neon FM no

3541
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:28,000
word if Neon FM will shoot out tickets I don't

3542
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:30,000
believe it does but that's all

3543
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:32,000
they had to do if they wanted to make this game super popular

3544
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:34,000
just put a little ticket dispenser in it

3545
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:36,000
and the better you do on a song the more tickets you get

3546
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:38,000
yeah well being that

3547
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:40,000
based off step mania they could probably

3548
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:42,000
do that or if you play that horrible girls butt

3549
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:44,000
songs it will actually take your tickets

3550
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:46,000
as like a penalty

3551
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:48,000
no if you play the girls

3552
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:50,000
butts then you get like

3553
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:52,000
kicked in the crotch I would laugh

3554
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:54,000
I would really laugh if they had

3555
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:56,000
like a game like that where the

3556
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:58,000
tickets would go in and out depending on how

3557
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:00,000
well you did I guess it would get all

3558
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:02,000
fucked up though because you know if

3559
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:04,000
you tore it off

3560
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:06,000
then it goes back in well they should be in like a

3561
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:08,000
glass case that you can't get into

3562
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:10,000
until the very end or it cuts it

3563
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:12,000
or something like it should be like

3564
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:14,000
look I'm going to give you all these no I'm not

3565
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:16,000
I'm going to give you all these no I'm not have you ever

3566
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:18,000
worked at an arcade of course

3567
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:20,000
not I did

3568
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:22,000
why would I subject myself to that bullshit

3569
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:24,000
one of my two of my first jobs involved

3570
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:26,000
arcade games and I know for a damn fact

3571
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:28,000
someone would figure out how to get in there

3572
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:30,000
my minimum wage job I already told you my minimum wage

3573
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:32,000
job was I worked at a video store and we rented

3574
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:34,000
porn and that was awesome

3575
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:36,000
anyhow

3576
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:38,000
alright

3577
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:40,000
whatever dark sorrow

3578
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:42,000
what do you have for us for the news I have some shit

3579
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:44,000
no um

3580
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:46,000
blizzard has once again

3581
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:48,000
changed the name of

3582
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:50,000
what was blizzard all stars

3583
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:52,000
and is now heroes

3584
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:54,000
of the storm

3585
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:56,000
I don't know why the fuck they're calling it that

3586
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:58,000
but yeah they even are quoted saying yep we

3587
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:00,000
changed it again so

3588
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,000
um basically

3589
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:04,000
they've also said set aside whatever you

3590
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:06,000
think you knew about blizzard all stars

3591
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:08,000
and it's supposed to be um

3592
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:10,000
more about it will be revealed at

3593
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:12,000
Blizzcon November 8th and

3594
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:14,000
9th and uh

3595
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:16,000
there apparently is a trailer

3596
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:18,000
online so look for it

3597
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:20,000
I kind of

3598
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:22,000
am like whatever although I have to

3599
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:24,000
say that the picture on here of the

3600
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:26,000
um whoever the

3601
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:28,000
uh orc is

3602
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:30,000
what am I saying orc uh

3603
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:32,000
whatever the fuck they're called

3604
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:34,000
god I played World of Warcraft for how long

3605
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:36,000
that looks like an orc yeah

3606
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:38,000
orc I'm just thinking ogre for some reason

3607
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:40,000
oh no it's an orc no the orc just

3608
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:42,000
looks absolutely hilarious so

3609
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:44,000
it's got a little cartoony vibe to it I will say

3610
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:46,000
though I actually think the new name is much better

3611
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:48,000
Blizzard all stars is a little dinky dinky

3612
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:50,000
yeah I mean I wonder if it's going to be

3613
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:52,000
cutesy like that though it opens it up to a

3614
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:54,000
bigger audience too because they're going to have to compete against

3615
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:56,000
all these other mobas that are already out there but

3616
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:58,000
you know I think um

3617
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:00,000
it's going to be interesting because I think

3618
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:02,000
uh the heroes of the storm

3619
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:04,000
or whatever has the potential to draw

3620
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:06,000
in a whole new audience to this

3621
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:08,000
you know with their built in warcraft audience

3622
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:10,000
and the people that are running the hearthstone and all this

3623
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:12,000
I think it's going to be very interesting to see how

3624
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:14,000
that plays out I might check it out I've just been

3625
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:16,000
a little bit burned on all things

3626
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:18,000
blizzard I finally uninstalled curse

3627
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:20,000
did you? I did

3628
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:22,000
reminds me of playstation all stars

3629
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:24,000
well yeah but it's not going to play anything like that

3630
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:26,000
it's going to be more like maybe that's why they changed the name

3631
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:28,000
because it's going to be it's basically

3632
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:30,000
league of legends which is ironic because

3633
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:32,000
I would argue that it's not

3634
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:34,000
final fantasy 14 or any of those games

3635
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:36,000
that wow has lost its players

3636
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:38,000
to it's to league of legends

3637
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:40,000
I think wow's probably lost more players to league of legends

3638
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:42,000
than anything else so

3639
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:44,000
and sucking

3640
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:46,000
it's interesting that they're going to

3641
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:48,000
kind of have their own answer to league

3642
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:50,000
of legends now so we'll see how it works

3643
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:52,000
by the way can I ask you about something not to go on a horde house tangent

3644
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:54,000
but I'd love to know what you think

3645
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:56,000
what did you think about the uh

3646
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:58,000
siege of orgrimmar ending

3647
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:00,000
I like that it was different

3648
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:02,000
if you were alliance or horde

3649
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:04,000
but here's the thing

3650
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:06,000
I hate to keep comparing it

3651
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:08,000
but I can't help myself like times

3652
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:10,000
have changed right like it's cool that you

3653
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:12,000
get a two and a half minute cinematic or whatever

3654
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:14,000
when you beat the game but over in final fantasy

3655
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:16,000
14 like that ending was seriously like

3656
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:18,000
15 minutes long and it was very satisfying

3657
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:20,000
and it was just

3658
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:22,000
I don't know like it kind of just made the warcraft

3659
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:24,000
endings look a little bit like

3660
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:26,000
oh that's all you get for

3661
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:28,000
putting up with all the abuse you take in LFR

3662
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:30,000
but as far as like you know

3663
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:32,000
what went down story wise

3664
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:34,000
I don't know it's kind of obvious

3665
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:36,000
well I mean we knew he was going down but I was actually

3666
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:38,000
a little bit surprised at who took over

3667
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:40,000
I wasn't at all

3668
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:42,000
but I was actually

3669
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:44,000
a little bit more surprised with

3670
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:46,000
Douchebag with Varian

3671
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:48,000
so that was a little bit more what surprised me

3672
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:50,000
well I was also a little bit surprised that Jaina was so bloodthirsty

3673
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:52,000
in the ending too cause she's

3674
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:54,000
they're really trying to make her the alliance

3675
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:56,000
answer to Sylvanas

3676
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:58,000
they were really trying to do that

3677
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:00,000
it just doesn't suit the character I mean it didn't surprise me

3678
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:02,000
given you know having your whole town blown up

3679
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:04,000
but at the same time

3680
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:06,000
it just seemed out of character for her

3681
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:08,000
anyway too much wow

3682
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:10,000
no no no I wanted to ask because

3683
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:12,000
that's fair it's a video game

3684
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:14,000
it is a video game we can talk about it

3685
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:16,000
you don't like it email us

3686
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:18,000
mailbag at orangesontrader.com stop talking about that stupid game

3687
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:20,000
alright Loki

3688
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:22,000
so Ubisoft

3689
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:24,000
has adjusted

3690
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:26,000
their financials and basically

3691
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:28,000
have deemed Splinter Cell

3692
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:30,000
Blacklist and Rayman Legends

3693
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:32,000
under performers

3694
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:34,000
and they said you know we've had games that were released

3695
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:36,000
for which we anticipate

3696
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:38,000
today lower sales than

3697
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:40,000
we anticipated when we first gave our targets

3698
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:42,000
and already released games

3699
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:44,000
of course such as Splinter Cell

3700
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:46,000
and Rayman and others

3701
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:48,000
you know also

3702
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:50,000
probably doesn't help too as we mentioned earlier

3703
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:52,000
they delayed Watch Dogs and the crew

3704
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:54,000
so

3705
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:56,000
I don't know what could they have done

3706
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:58,000
better

3707
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:00,000
I just don't think there was a lot of interest

3708
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:02,000
in Splinter Cell Blacklist like they thought

3709
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:04,000
like everyone was kind of hyped up about it

3710
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:06,000
I think at E3 and it was just kind of

3711
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:08,000
eh you know

3712
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:10,000
maybe because that's when the Grand Theft Auto

3713
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:12,000
train started or Saints Row 4

3714
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:14,000
coming out around the same time and stuff

3715
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:16,000
I don't know

3716
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:18,000
maybe it's just I know the reviews

3717
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:20,000
weren't that fantastic for Blacklist

3718
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:22,000
Rayman Legends looked good

3719
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:24,000
but I guess a lot of people

3720
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:26,000
you know it would have been a better February

3721
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:28,000
title I think I think people saw right through

3722
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:30,000
what they did with Rayman Legends I think

3723
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:32,000
it's not that like pissing off the Nintendo

3724
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:34,000
fanboys had that big an impact but I think

3725
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:36,000
a lot of people saw right the people that would

3726
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:38,000
tend to buy games on day one see

3727
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:40,000
right through the fact that it was a Wii U

3728
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:42,000
game that was backed into the parking

3729
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:44,000
spot of a 360 place I understand that

3730
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:46,000
but what about the difference in

3731
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:48,000
you know had they released it just on Wii U

3732
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:50,000
what their potential sales are

3733
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:52,000
and even now like with the Wii U

3734
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:54,000
coming out you know version coming out in September

3735
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:56,000
versus February that's still a lot

3736
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:58,000
more you know months in between there

3737
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:00,000
and systems being sold that there's

3738
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:02,000
potential buyers I mean they kind

3739
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:04,000
of had to do that it was the logical way

3740
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:06,000
to do it they should have released the Wii U game

3741
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:08,000
the way they'd always planned and then they should have

3742
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:10,000
released the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3

3743
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:12,000
version later and called it

3744
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:14,000
a gold edition or an enhanced

3745
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:16,000
make it feel like an enhanced version

3746
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:18,000
not a scaled back version

3747
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:20,000
maybe or maybe just Nintendo

3748
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:22,000
wasn't giving them any money to make it exclusive

3749
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:24,000
and so you know there was no incentive

3750
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:26,000
to do that maybe if they threw a little bit of

3751
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:28,000
money their way then they could have had another

3752
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:30,000
good exclusive title I don't think these games

3753
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:32,000
are necessarily damned though because you know

3754
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:34,000
it's gonna have staying power throughout the holidays

3755
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:36,000
I think again I said the people who will

3756
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:38,000
buy it on day one may be able to

3757
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:40,000
see right through it but you're still gonna have it's a very

3758
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:42,000
family accessible family friendly title

3759
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:44,000
you know I think Rayman does very well

3760
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:46,000
you know there's parents aren't

3761
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:48,000
afraid to buy that for their younger kids so I

3762
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:50,000
think that title can still tend to do well

3763
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:52,000
throughout the holidays I don't know I gotta be honest

3764
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:54,000
when I hear a story like this I think about

3765
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:56,000
just a few months ago we heard that

3766
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:58,000
Square Enix story about the guy getting up there

3767
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:00,000
saying Tomb Raider underperformed

3768
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:02,000
and we were all sitting here going are you high

3769
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:04,000
Tomb Raider was like the best

3770
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:06,000
that they've done in that series it's a very

3771
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:08,000
long time it's a little different you know because with

3772
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:10,000
like Splinter Cell that was the number four game

3773
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:12,000
of the month in uh you know

3774
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:14,000
August they're Madden Saints World 4

3775
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:16,000
and Disney Infinity beating it out

3776
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:18,000
um I mean

3777
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:20,000
there's not a whole lot of other games

3778
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:22,000
besides those

3779
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:24,000
you know in the month

3780
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:26,000
uh versus Tomb Raider which is like

3781
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:28,000
one of the top selling games of the month

3782
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:30,000
I think it was like one or two

3783
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:32,000
you know cause Bioshock Infinite came out

3784
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:34,000
that same month so

3785
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:36,000
it's hard to tell I don't think

3786
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:38,000
it outsold Bioshock Infinite but it was

3787
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:40,000
definitely popular

3788
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:42,000
um so I could

3789
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:44,000
see the demand there for you know Tomb Raider

3790
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:46,000
and stuff but I'm not seeing a lot of like people

3791
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:48,000
saying oh I need copies of Splinter Cell because

3792
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:50,000
it sold out you know it's just Tomb Raider

3793
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:52,000
was like oh I need more Tomb Raider but

3794
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:54,000
I don't

3795
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:56,000
know we'll see maybe

3796
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:58,000
they still have Rainbow Six

3797
02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:00,000
Patriots supposed to be coming

3798
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:02,000
out at some point you know and um

3799
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:04,000
I'm sure they'll

3800
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:06,000
do well in the fourth quarter Satsuns Creed

3801
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:08,000
is going to be a strong title for them and South Park

3802
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:10,000
looks awesome so

3803
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:12,000
they're not going to hurt too much oh

3804
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:14,000
and Just Dance I mean that's definitely going to help

3805
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:16,000
so they've got a pretty solid fourth

3806
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:18,000
quarter

3807
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:20,000
alright um moving on to

3808
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:22,000
a story about a game

3809
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:24,000
that is disappearing not because it underperformed

3810
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:26,000
but because of license issues

3811
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:28,000
Yoshi's Cookie I don't know if you

3812
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:30,000
guys remember this game it was a game that was on the NES

3813
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:32,000
it was actually what they don't

3814
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:34,000
say in a lot of these articles about this story is that it

3815
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:36,000
was also on the Super Nintendo because it's where I remember

3816
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:38,000
playing it was it was on the Super Nintendo

3817
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:40,000
but they released the Nintendo version of it

3818
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:42,000
for the Virtual Console some

3819
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:44,000
time ago Yoshi's Cookie

3820
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:46,000
it got delisted this week it's

3821
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:48,000
removed you will no longer be able to access it

3822
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:50,000
on the Virtual Console it was pulled on

3823
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:52,000
October 18th which bummer I

3824
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:54,000
should have got it but the Super Nintendo version was better anyway

3825
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:56,000
um

3826
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:58,000
here's the thing about the game Yoshi's Cookie wasn't developed

3827
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:00,000
by Nintendo it was developed by Bulletproof

3828
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:02,000
Software Bulletproof made the

3829
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:04,000
Tetris port for the Game Boy in 1989

3830
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:06,000
which was you know huge

3831
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:08,000
so that's why Nintendo you know trusted

3832
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:10,000
them with the Yoshi stuff but

3833
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:12,000
expired licenses being as

3834
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:14,000
they are the game is no longer available

3835
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:16,000
for sale

3836
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:18,000
this is not the first game to be delisted

3837
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:20,000
for similar reasons Konami's

3838
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:22,000
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles no longer available

3839
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:24,000
Irem did a version of R-Type that was on

3840
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:26,000
the Virtual Console no longer there the Donkey Kong

3841
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:28,000
Country trilogy also no

3842
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:30,000
longer there so

3843
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:32,000
if you didn't get this game I

3844
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:34,000
guess you'll have to go steal it from a ROM

3845
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:36,000
or go find it at

3846
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:38,000
Garage Sale good luck to you

3847
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:40,000
I guess I could lend it to somebody

3848
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:42,000
do you have the Super Nintendo version because I like the

3849
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:44,000
Super Nintendo version I don't believe I do actually

3850
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:46,000
I might have to check I mean at this

3851
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:48,000
point I don't know what I have

3852
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:50,000
after playing the Super Nintendo version the NES version

3853
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:52,000
felt kind of gimped you know

3854
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:54,000
as sometimes happens there were a few titles like

3855
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:56,000
that that were on both platforms

3856
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:58,000
but anyway

3857
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:00,000
it's not like it was that good of a puzzler

3858
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:02,000
it was just kind of fun it had a

3859
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:04,000
good versus mode in it

3860
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:06,000

02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:34,000

I'll just leave it to everybody to listen to

3877
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:41,000
um hey OLR since Mark Hamill has

3878
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:43,000
retired from doing the Joker voice I wanted to

3879
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:45,000
know what you thought of Troy Baker talking

3880
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:47,000
I'm sorry taking over the role for the new Batman

3881
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:49,000
Arkham game I had my doubts until

3882
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:51,000
I heard a sample reading from

3883
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:53,000
the killing joke that he gave

3884
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:55,000
during the Arkham Origins panel

3885
02:11:55,000 --> 02:11:57,000
at New York Comic Con this guy is

3886
02:11:57,000 --> 02:11:59,000
super talented for sure I linked the

3887
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:01,000
YouTube video if you have time to play it it's just

3888
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:03,000
over a minute long and starts 2

3889
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:05,000
minutes and 11 seconds in if

3890
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:07,000
the link doesn't jump there right away what

3891
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:09,000
do you all think? I've heard it's awesome

3892
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:11,000
uh actually I remember

3893
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:13,000
hearing about this but I didn't

3894
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:15,000
hear the actual voice so

3895
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:17,000
courtesy of Flaco Jones

3896
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:19,000
memories

3897
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:21,000
can be vile

3898
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:23,000
perfect

3899
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:25,000
repulsive little

3900
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:27,000
brutes like children

3901
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:29,000
I suppose

3902
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:31,000
but

3903
02:12:31,000 --> 02:12:33,000
can we live without them

3904
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:35,000
memories are what our reason

3905
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:37,000
is based upon

3906
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:39,000
if we can't face them we

3907
02:12:39,000 --> 02:12:41,000
deny reason itself

3908
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:43,000
okay he gets a pass

3909
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:45,000
that's good I like that

3910
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:47,000
I've heard him do something else

3911
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:49,000
and I'm trying to remember where I've heard that voice before

3912
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:51,000
4 for you Troy Baker you go Troy Baker oh god he's a

3913
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:53,000
hugely popular voice no I know but I'm trying

3914
02:12:53,000 --> 02:12:55,000
to remember um what

3915
02:12:55,000 --> 02:12:57,000
specifically I have recently

3916
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:01,000
um well he was in Bioshock Infinite

3917
02:13:01,000 --> 02:13:03,000
which I haven't played

3918
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:05,000
either

3919
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:07,000
what would you have played that he

3920
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:09,000
was in I'm trying to think

3921
02:13:09,000 --> 02:13:11,000
because he's done a ton of anime

3922
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:13,000
hold on which I don't

3923
02:13:13,000 --> 02:13:15,000
really watch Fubbed Anime

3924
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:17,000
Snow he was Snow in 13

3925
02:13:17,000 --> 02:13:19,000
Kid Icarus Uprising

3926
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:21,000
you mentioned you played uh he's in that

3927
02:13:21,000 --> 02:13:23,000
um

3928
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:25,000
Metal Gear Solid he's

3929
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:27,000
Ocelot in 5

3930
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:29,000
okay so he was Hawkeye

3931
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:31,000
which I

3932
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:33,000
have watched because of Jennifer

3933
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:35,000
Hale oh and uh he's

3934
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:37,000
James in Silent Hill 2 oh but only in the HD

3935
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:39,000
version I think

3936
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:41,000
oh then yeah which I didn't play

3937
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:43,000
either oh well anyhow

3938
02:13:43,000 --> 02:13:45,000
moving on yeah well

3939
02:13:45,000 --> 02:13:47,000
oh no he was Robin

3940
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:49,000
in Arkham City and Two-Face

3941
02:13:49,000 --> 02:13:51,000
so I knew he had been in another of

3942
02:13:51,000 --> 02:13:53,000
the games before Game Guru

3943
02:13:53,000 --> 02:13:55,000
in chat says wait that wasn't Mark Hamill

3944
02:13:55,000 --> 02:13:57,000
nope nope that was that was Troy Baker

3945
02:13:57,000 --> 02:13:59,000
good job yeah well I mean

3946
02:13:59,000 --> 02:14:01,000
I'd have to say that's pretty good if you know you can actually

3947
02:14:01,000 --> 02:14:03,000
get him confused with Mark Hamill

3948
02:14:03,000 --> 02:14:05,000
so um anyway

3949
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:07,000
moving on um this

3950
02:14:07,000 --> 02:14:09,000
comes from um

3951
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:11,000
Brian

3952
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:13,000
and I did see Shane

3953
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:15,000
say that he's sung with Akira Yamamoto's band

3954
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:17,000
um okay

3955
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:19,000
hi OLR I'm disappointed

3956
02:14:19,000 --> 02:14:21,000
with current gen Star Trek games

3957
02:14:21,000 --> 02:14:23,000
Star Trek Legacy was released on

3958
02:14:23,000 --> 02:14:25,000
360 N06 it took the franchise

3959
02:14:25,000 --> 02:14:27,000
seven more years to release a Star Trek game

3960
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:29,000
overall the franchise has released

3961
02:14:29,000 --> 02:14:31,000
low quality games for current gen consoles

3962
02:14:31,000 --> 02:14:33,000
do you see a future for Star Trek games in the

3963
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:35,000
next gen consoles thanks

3964
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:37,000
um well Brian I don't think so

3965
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:39,000
I mean

3966
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:41,000
if they do anything it's gonna definitely be like

3967
02:14:41,000 --> 02:14:43,000
um a movie tie in I think

3968
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:45,000
well the last movie tie in was pretty

3969
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:47,000
terrible too that's the problem there's nothing

3970
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:49,000
to make the games really

3971
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:51,000
on right now unless

3972
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:53,000
you know they go back and

3973
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:55,000
do a new next generation game which would be

3974
02:14:55,000 --> 02:14:57,000
awesome uh they do

3975
02:14:57,000 --> 02:14:59,000
have the Star Trek next generation pinball table

3976
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:01,000
in pinball arcade just random tangent

3977
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:03,000
cause when I saw that I got giddy

3978
02:15:03,000 --> 02:15:05,000
um I will say this though so one thing

3979
02:15:05,000 --> 02:15:07,000
that email left out and I don't know if that's just because

3980
02:15:07,000 --> 02:15:09,000
this person is very console focused but

3981
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:11,000
you neglected Star Trek online

3982
02:15:11,000 --> 02:15:13,000
which I don't think I mean it's free to play

3983
02:15:13,000 --> 02:15:15,000
it's worth a look I don't think it's bad

3984
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:17,000
especially if you're a Star Trek fan I think it's worth checking out

3985
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:19,000
and I have to say that they did actually retool

3986
02:15:19,000 --> 02:15:21,000
um that the skill system

3987
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:23,000
that I kind of got pissed off when they changed it

3988
02:15:23,000 --> 02:15:25,000
the first time it's a lot more

3989
02:15:25,000 --> 02:15:27,000
manageable now um space battles

3990
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:29,000
are still kind of you know you have to

3991
02:15:29,000 --> 02:15:31,000
ease into it from beginning to

3992
02:15:31,000 --> 02:15:33,000
admiral for you to finally get and they

3993
02:15:33,000 --> 02:15:35,000
got rid of rear admiral as a rank I'm just saying

3994
02:15:35,000 --> 02:15:37,000
but um

3995
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:39,000
it was it was

3996
02:15:39,000 --> 02:15:41,000
Star Trek online was really good

3997
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:43,000
I liked it I mean really all I did was ever

3998
02:15:43,000 --> 02:15:45,000
play it hang out at deep space night and play

3999
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:47,000
Dabo Dabo with

4000
02:15:47,000 --> 02:15:49,000
Lina so

4001
02:15:49,000 --> 02:15:51,000
so there's that

4002
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:53,000
I mean but unfortunately the reality is

4003
02:15:53,000 --> 02:15:55,000
without that stuff to tie into

4004
02:15:55,000 --> 02:15:57,000
and the fact that the video games unfortunately

4005
02:15:57,000 --> 02:15:59,000
have been tanking like it doesn't look

4006
02:15:59,000 --> 02:16:01,000
good which pains me because

4007
02:16:01,000 --> 02:16:03,000
I love me some Trek and I would love

4008
02:16:03,000 --> 02:16:05,000
to see like a really good video game

4009
02:16:05,000 --> 02:16:07,000
happen and it's kind of irritating that

4010
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:09,000
that last one was such a stinker

4011
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:11,000
actually going back to Star Trek online

4012
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:13,000
I do suggest if this person has not played

4013
02:16:13,000 --> 02:16:15,000
it to do so because no matter which

4014
02:16:15,000 --> 02:16:17,000
era of Star Trek you liked

4015
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:19,000
and yeah I really did not like Enterprise

4016
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:21,000
but there are enough nods to the

4017
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:23,000
even TOS characters show

4018
02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:25,000
up like you actually do a time

4019
02:16:25,000 --> 02:16:27,000
travel one and meet you know McCoy

4020
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:29,000
and actually the model looks pretty

4021
02:16:29,000 --> 02:16:31,000
pretty much like he did

4022
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:33,000
so I mean it's really really

4023
02:16:33,000 --> 02:16:35,000
fun I think

4024
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:37,000
if you like Star Trek it's got enough nods that I think

4025
02:16:37,000 --> 02:16:39,000
it would keep you interested

4026
02:16:39,000 --> 02:16:41,000
nice

4027
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:43,000
so um

4028
02:16:43,000 --> 02:16:45,000
back to the email

4029
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:47,000
we have a kind of long one

4030
02:16:47,000 --> 02:16:49,000
but not terribly long so I'll read it

4031
02:16:49,000 --> 02:16:51,000
hello there OLR

4032
02:16:51,000 --> 02:16:53,000
hi

4033
02:16:53,000 --> 02:16:55,000
I always feel the need to say hi back I'm friendly

4034
02:16:55,000 --> 02:16:57,000
yeah you're friendly you're so

4035
02:16:57,000 --> 02:16:59,000
friendly um well last week

4036
02:16:59,000 --> 02:17:01,000
I had a very very unfortunate thing happen

4037
02:17:01,000 --> 02:17:03,000
to me when looking for alternative digital

4038
02:17:03,000 --> 02:17:05,000
distribution network now you

4039
02:17:05,000 --> 02:17:07,000
guys know I'm not big on DRM so I was really

4040
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:09,000
happy that gamersgate.com

4041
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:11,000
had a selection of DRM free titles

4042
02:17:11,000 --> 02:17:13,000
I bought a couple only to find out that the games

4043
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:15,000
weren't all they seemed wait who is this

4044
02:17:15,000 --> 02:17:17,000
because they say we have to make some assumptions

4045
02:17:17,000 --> 02:17:19,000
about them in advance

4046
02:17:19,000 --> 02:17:21,000
ah I see okay

4047
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:23,000
okay

4048
02:17:23,000 --> 02:17:25,000
um instead of giving

4049
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:27,000
me a full installer I got very small files

4050
02:17:27,000 --> 02:17:29,000
that pull temporary files from the internet for installation

4051
02:17:29,000 --> 02:17:31,000
as I would find out after

4052
02:17:31,000 --> 02:17:33,000
perusing the site you're not able to get full

4053
02:17:33,000 --> 02:17:35,000
proper installers even if you keep the

4054
02:17:35,000 --> 02:17:37,000
temp files you can't install your game

4055
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:39,000
without an internet connection needless to say

4056
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:41,000
I was angry I shot off an email

4057
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:43,000
to gamersgate asking for

4058
02:17:43,000 --> 02:17:45,000
remedy for this issue only be told point

4059
02:17:45,000 --> 02:17:47,000
blank there only called

4060
02:17:47,000 --> 02:17:49,000
them DRM free because there were no serial

4061
02:17:49,000 --> 02:17:51,000
numbers the person

4062
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:53,000
who emailed me back even had the gall to say

4063
02:17:53,000 --> 02:17:55,000
that Steam and Origin weren't DRM

4064
02:17:55,000 --> 02:17:57,000
and that theirs was an industry standard

4065
02:17:57,000 --> 02:17:59,000
despite my never having seen something like

4066
02:17:59,000 --> 02:18:01,000
this before for the record the Steam versions

4067
02:18:01,000 --> 02:18:03,000
you do get the full games downloaded

4068
02:18:03,000 --> 02:18:05,000
so that is a point um

4069
02:18:05,000 --> 02:18:07,000
I demanded my money back but they

4070
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:09,000
refused to budge so now I'm left sending you

4071
02:18:09,000 --> 02:18:11,000
an email and hoping to steer anyone else away

4072
02:18:11,000 --> 02:18:13,000
from there you know you do have the better business bureau

4073
02:18:13,000 --> 02:18:15,000
you can file an official complaint

4074
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:17,000
especially if you feel like what you got wasn't

4075
02:18:17,000 --> 02:18:19,000
what was advertised I think you know you do

4076
02:18:19,000 --> 02:18:21,000
have a legit basis for complaint there

4077
02:18:21,000 --> 02:18:23,000
exactly especially since you

4078
02:18:23,000 --> 02:18:25,000
messaged them first to remedy

4079
02:18:25,000 --> 02:18:27,000
it cause you have to have taken that step

4080
02:18:27,000 --> 02:18:29,000
and I'm gonna be real this

4081
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:31,000
is Orange Lounge Radio not

4082
02:18:31,000 --> 02:18:33,000
you know a TV network or something I mean

4083
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:35,000
we're a small group

4084
02:18:35,000 --> 02:18:37,000
here we love our audience we love the

4085
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:39,000
small following that we have but

4086
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:41,000
this wouldn't really make waves

4087
02:18:41,000 --> 02:18:43,000
the way that I think you

4088
02:18:43,000 --> 02:18:45,000
you really want this company to

4089
02:18:45,000 --> 02:18:47,000
own up to what they're selling

4090
02:18:47,000 --> 02:18:49,000
well just but I appreciate

4091
02:18:49,000 --> 02:18:51,000
the heads up nonetheless seriously

4092
02:18:51,000 --> 02:18:53,000
I don't care what your attitude is towards DRM

4093
02:18:53,000 --> 02:18:55,000
it's unacceptable for a company to say that

4094
02:18:55,000 --> 02:18:57,000
something is DRM free when it really isn't

4095
02:18:57,000 --> 02:18:59,000
it's the most

4096
02:18:59,000 --> 02:19:01,000
disgusting dishonest thing I have ever experienced

4097
02:19:01,000 --> 02:19:03,000
and I wholeheartedly recommend people stay the hell away

4098
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:05,000
from gamersgate.com after all

4099
02:19:05,000 --> 02:19:07,000
if they're lying about this what else are they lying about

4100
02:19:07,000 --> 02:19:09,000
however this is not a tale

4101
02:19:09,000 --> 02:19:11,000
of total loss I emailed Robert Boyd

4102
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:13,000
of Zeboid Games and told him what happened

4103
02:19:13,000 --> 02:19:15,000
he immediately sent me

4104
02:19:15,000 --> 02:19:17,000
a desperate copy of the game that I had

4105
02:19:17,000 --> 02:19:19,000
bought and they were actually DRM free

4106
02:19:19,000 --> 02:19:21,000
moral of the story avoid gamersgate

4107
02:19:21,000 --> 02:19:23,000
and thumbs up to Zeboid

4108
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:25,000
still waiting on response from Valusoft though

4109
02:19:25,000 --> 02:19:27,000
well that's my story hope I've steered a few people away from

4110
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:29,000
gamersgate if I've helped someone the money I lost

4111
02:19:29,000 --> 02:19:31,000
was worth it sincerely we're all still UT

4112
02:19:31,000 --> 02:19:33,000
kinda interesting way he went about

4113
02:19:33,000 --> 02:19:35,000
the second half of that email where he says

4114
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:37,000
I emailed the people that made the game

4115
02:19:37,000 --> 02:19:39,000
and said did you know this

4116
02:19:39,000 --> 02:19:41,000
but what's interesting to me is that he kind of breezed

4117
02:19:41,000 --> 02:19:43,000
by the fact that he got the Desura code

4118
02:19:43,000 --> 02:19:45,000
so why not is Desura

4119
02:19:45,000 --> 02:19:47,000
now your option of choice because

4120
02:19:47,000 --> 02:19:49,000
I know a lot of people are using Desura as a Steam alternative

4121
02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:51,000
and even I've used it because

4122
02:19:51,000 --> 02:19:53,000
one of our listeners was kind enough to give me a game

4123
02:19:53,000 --> 02:19:55,000
but it was on Desura so I've used it and it's fine

4124
02:19:55,000 --> 02:19:57,000
so is that

4125
02:19:57,000 --> 02:19:59,000
is Desura like your happy

4126
02:19:59,000 --> 02:20:01,000
alternative now that you've found

4127
02:20:01,000 --> 02:20:03,000
I don't know if I really heard that part of it

4128
02:20:03,000 --> 02:20:05,000
but I will say this in the email

4129
02:20:05,000 --> 02:20:07,000
in our chat room live.vognetware.com

4130
02:20:07,000 --> 02:20:09,000
actdef says

4131
02:20:09,000 --> 02:20:11,000
gamersgate is a mess of a site

4132
02:20:11,000 --> 02:20:13,000
I try not to buy from them

4133
02:20:13,000 --> 02:20:15,000
I've never heard of this site I have no opinion

4134
02:20:15,000 --> 02:20:17,000
I can only go off what the listeners say

4135
02:20:17,000 --> 02:20:19,000
and Rama says to file a

4136
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:21,000
chargeback on your credit card

4137
02:20:21,000 --> 02:20:23,000
usually you want to do that as a last

4138
02:20:23,000 --> 02:20:25,000
resort because that can come back to bite you

4139
02:20:25,000 --> 02:20:27,000
I would say better business bureau first

4140
02:20:27,000 --> 02:20:29,000
and I do believe if I've

4141
02:20:29,000 --> 02:20:31,000
heard right if you've done a chargeback

4142
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:33,000
then the company themselves may actually file

4143
02:20:33,000 --> 02:20:35,000
with a collection

4144
02:20:35,000 --> 02:20:37,000
which shows up on your credit report

4145
02:20:37,000 --> 02:20:39,000
you've got to be careful with that stuff

4146
02:20:39,000 --> 02:20:41,000
but no I'd say

4147
02:20:41,000 --> 02:20:43,000
you don't want to burn your chargebacks because obviously the bank

4148
02:20:43,000 --> 02:20:45,000
is going to take issue if you keep doing it

4149
02:20:45,000 --> 02:20:47,000
I wouldn't want to burn it on something like this

4150
02:20:47,000 --> 02:20:49,000
like use a chargeback when you really want to

4151
02:20:49,000 --> 02:20:51,000
fuck somebody over

4152
02:20:51,000 --> 02:20:53,000
my suggestion is

4153
02:20:53,000 --> 02:20:55,000
have copies of all of the emails you've sent

4154
02:20:55,000 --> 02:20:57,000
plus the responses dated

4155
02:20:57,000 --> 02:20:59,000
make sure they're date stamped

4156
02:20:59,000 --> 02:21:01,000
and use those with your filing

4157
02:21:01,000 --> 02:21:03,000
to the better business bureau you know I got a free hamburger doing that

4158
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:05,000
once

4159
02:21:05,000 --> 02:21:07,000
I got a free meal

4160
02:21:07,000 --> 02:21:09,000
from this place and they didn't give you fries the

4161
02:21:09,000 --> 02:21:11,000
cheap bastards no no no I got a sweet potato

4162
02:21:11,000 --> 02:21:13,000
fries I got a whole meal nice and

4163
02:21:13,000 --> 02:21:15,000
they actually we actually

4164
02:21:15,000 --> 02:21:17,000
got to see them make the meal

4165
02:21:17,000 --> 02:21:19,000
a free voucher for a meal for two

4166
02:21:19,000 --> 02:21:21,000
because I complained about

4167
02:21:21,000 --> 02:21:23,000
the strata place that's on

4168
02:21:23,000 --> 02:21:25,000
Watt Avenue I used to work

4169
02:21:25,000 --> 02:21:27,000
next door to them so oh I don't even know

4170
02:21:27,000 --> 02:21:29,000
it's attached to like a Days Inn or something

4171
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:31,000
but oh but it's a nice

4172
02:21:31,000 --> 02:21:33,000
restaurant attached to a crappy hotel

4173
02:21:33,000 --> 02:21:35,000
but anyway yeah I

4174
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:37,000
can say for a fact that I've actually gotten something

4175
02:21:37,000 --> 02:21:39,000
out of filing better business bureau complaints so

4176
02:21:39,000 --> 02:21:41,000
and it was a pretty damn good hamburger too

4177
02:21:41,000 --> 02:21:43,000
that

4178
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:45,000
is a tasty burger maybe

4179
02:21:45,000 --> 02:21:47,000
Gamers Gate will send you a hamburger

4180
02:21:47,000 --> 02:21:49,000
well we'll

4181
02:21:49,000 --> 02:21:51,000
cross our fingers and our toes

4182
02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:53,000
and then share with us okay

4183
02:21:53,000 --> 02:21:55,000
last email

4184
02:21:55,000 --> 02:21:57,000
okay hi OLR it's

4185
02:21:57,000 --> 02:21:59,000
Reginator again

4186
02:21:59,000 --> 02:22:01,000
I just had a question about computer

4187
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:03,000
OS's currently I'm on my laptop

4188
02:22:03,000 --> 02:22:05,000
I have no currently on my laptop

4189
02:22:05,000 --> 02:22:07,000
I have Windows 7 home premium installed

4190
02:22:07,000 --> 02:22:09,000
which overall I'm happy with now the

4191
02:22:09,000 --> 02:22:11,000
trouble is I am a supporter of Zune

4192
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:13,000
Xbox video in order for me to continue

4193
02:22:13,000 --> 02:22:15,000
buying content for it either I

4194
02:22:15,000 --> 02:22:17,000
have to replace my 360 that I sold

4195
02:22:17,000 --> 02:22:19,000
off two years ago or upgrade to

4196
02:22:19,000 --> 02:22:21,000
Windows 8 now the question is

4197
02:22:21,000 --> 02:22:23,000
is it possible to finagle things so I can keep

4198
02:22:23,000 --> 02:22:25,000
Windows 7 and use Windows 8

4199
02:22:25,000 --> 02:22:27,000
I don't know like put Windows 8 on a USB

4200
02:22:27,000 --> 02:22:29,000
drive or something how would I do

4201
02:22:29,000 --> 02:22:31,000
that I never once did anything on a

4202
02:22:31,000 --> 02:22:33,000
computer regarding an OS and I hate to either

4203
02:22:33,000 --> 02:22:35,000
brick my PC lose Windows 7 etc.

4204
02:22:35,000 --> 02:22:37,000
thanks in advance

4205
02:22:37,000 --> 02:22:39,000
I will tell you this that Windows OS

4206
02:22:39,000 --> 02:22:41,000
in both cases are very

4207
02:22:41,000 --> 02:22:43,000
well

4208
02:22:43,000 --> 02:22:45,000
extraneous with the other stuff that they

4209
02:22:45,000 --> 02:22:47,000
install with it so you'd probably

4210
02:22:47,000 --> 02:22:49,000
depending on how big your hard drive is you could

4211
02:22:49,000 --> 02:22:51,000
probably partition

4212
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:53,000
yeah that's probably going to have to be the way you do it

4213
02:22:53,000 --> 02:22:55,000
because you can dual boot your system

4214
02:22:55,000 --> 02:22:57,000
but I don't know why you'd really

4215
02:22:57,000 --> 02:22:59,000
want to do that if you want to go to Windows 8 then just go

4216
02:22:59,000 --> 02:23:01,000
to Windows 8 you know if you need to see

4217
02:23:01,000 --> 02:23:03,000
the new movies which I think is kind of a dick move

4218
02:23:03,000 --> 02:23:05,000
on Microsoft's part I don't want to go to Windows

4219
02:23:05,000 --> 02:23:07,000
8 but I know that when I rebuild my computer

4220
02:23:07,000 --> 02:23:09,000
I'm basically going to put Windows 7 on it no matter

4221
02:23:09,000 --> 02:23:11,000
what it comes with

4222
02:23:11,000 --> 02:23:13,000
well don't forget 8.1 is out now

4223
02:23:13,000 --> 02:23:15,000
I haven't used that myself

4224
02:23:15,000 --> 02:23:17,000
there's stuff that make it like a lot more usable

4225
02:23:17,000 --> 02:23:19,000
like you know so it's more like 7

4226
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:21,000
and Windows 8 overall is

4227
02:23:21,000 --> 02:23:23,000
more stable than Windows 7

4228
02:23:23,000 --> 02:23:25,000
it's just all the crap that they throw in the

4229
02:23:25,000 --> 02:23:27,000
front there that you have to dig through

4230
02:23:27,000 --> 02:23:29,000
and stuff's kind of moved around

4231
02:23:29,000 --> 02:23:31,000
see at this point I'm ready just to go back to

4232
02:23:31,000 --> 02:23:33,000
Linux Mint and Runwine for

4233
02:23:33,000 --> 02:23:35,000
my other programs

4234
02:23:35,000 --> 02:23:37,000
I mean they've now got most

4235
02:23:37,000 --> 02:23:39,000
of the game drivers and everything

4236
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:41,000
compatible with Linux

4237
02:23:41,000 --> 02:23:43,000
comments from our chat room at live.vognetware.com

4238
02:23:43,000 --> 02:23:45,000
Rama says you don't need to upgrade to 8

4239
02:23:45,000 --> 02:23:47,000
SG100Matt says dual boot if you want

4240
02:23:47,000 --> 02:23:49,000
but there's no need for 8

4241
02:23:49,000 --> 02:23:51,000
Brad from Pod Culture says just go to 8

4242
02:23:51,000 --> 02:23:53,000
it runs everything from 7 just fine

4243
02:23:53,000 --> 02:23:55,000
and then Bobby Blackwolf says this is a

4244
02:23:55,000 --> 02:23:57,000
tech support question not a podcast email

4245
02:23:57,000 --> 02:23:59,000
question well I'm wondering because

4246
02:23:59,000 --> 02:24:01,000
he said the USB boot thing I'm wondering if he didn't

4247
02:24:01,000 --> 02:24:03,000
think of that because we were talking about it with

4248
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:05,000
Linux a couple weeks ago

4249
02:24:05,000 --> 02:24:07,000
I don't know though that Windows 8 will

4250
02:24:07,000 --> 02:24:09,000
live boot you can't do a Windows boot like that

4251
02:24:09,000 --> 02:24:11,000
I'm pretty sure yeah

4252
02:24:11,000 --> 02:24:13,000
although I have done a

4253
02:24:13,000 --> 02:24:15,000
USB installer for

4254
02:24:15,000 --> 02:24:17,000
Windows for

4255
02:24:17,000 --> 02:24:19,000
fuck what that was

4256
02:24:19,000 --> 02:24:21,000
a netbook

4257
02:24:21,000 --> 02:24:23,000
I have made an installer

4258
02:24:23,000 --> 02:24:25,000
so I don't know

4259
02:24:25,000 --> 02:24:27,000
is that it for emails? yeah that's it

4260
02:24:27,000 --> 02:24:29,000

4271
02:25:03,000 --> 02:25:05,000
here's the part of the show where we get angsty why?

4272
02:25:05,000 --> 02:25:07,000
because we can't

4273
02:25:07,000 --> 02:25:09,000
um FU to all the people who are

4274
02:25:09,000 --> 02:25:11,000
driving 10 miles under the speed limit and I mean

4275
02:25:11,000 --> 02:25:13,000
it was like five fucking people driving 30

4276
02:25:13,000 --> 02:25:15,000
in a 40 and I was like

4277
02:25:15,000 --> 02:25:17,000
really people don't you know what a speed

4278
02:25:17,000 --> 02:25:19,000
limit is and how to you know use it

4279
02:25:19,000 --> 02:25:21,000
flow of traffic hello

4280
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:23,000
and the um

4281
02:25:23,000 --> 02:25:25,000
wasp sting that I got

4282
02:25:25,000 --> 02:25:27,000
that still hasn't healed look at this

4283
02:25:27,000 --> 02:25:29,000
it's still there

4284
02:25:29,000 --> 02:25:31,000
and also not having a job

4285
02:25:31,000 --> 02:25:33,000
if somebody is listening to the show and you love

4286
02:25:33,000 --> 02:25:35,000
the sound of my voice just keep in mind that I can

4287
02:25:35,000 --> 02:25:37,000
also transfer the

4288
02:25:37,000 --> 02:25:39,000
sexyness to web design

4289
02:25:39,000 --> 02:25:41,000
and print design and fantastic customer service

4290
02:25:41,000 --> 02:25:43,000
and amazing customer service I love

4291
02:25:43,000 --> 02:25:45,000
talking to pissed off people

4292
02:25:45,000 --> 02:25:47,000
it's what you know how do you de-escalate a customer

4293
02:25:47,000 --> 02:25:49,000
de-escalate a customer well if they're yelling

4294
02:25:49,000 --> 02:25:51,000
and cursing at me I give them a time out

4295
02:25:51,000 --> 02:25:53,000
it works seriously we weren't allowed to

4296
02:25:53,000 --> 02:25:55,000
hang up on people right so

4297
02:25:55,000 --> 02:25:57,000
if it was all I want my pay off

4298
02:25:57,000 --> 02:25:59,000
I'd be like

4299
02:25:59,000 --> 02:26:01,000
now I'm sorry we need to have this

4300
02:26:01,000 --> 02:26:03,000
conversation like civil adults so

4301
02:26:03,000 --> 02:26:05,000
I'm going to put you on hold for two minutes

4302
02:26:05,000 --> 02:26:07,000
let you calm down a little bit

4303
02:26:07,000 --> 02:26:09,000
so we can come back and discuss this like adults

4304
02:26:09,000 --> 02:26:11,000
bing!

4305
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:13,000
you know what they'd either hang up on me or they would come back and be nice

4306
02:26:17,000 --> 02:26:19,000
that'll get you a job alright

4307
02:26:19,000 --> 02:26:21,000
you know what it works

4308
02:26:21,000 --> 02:26:23,000
and they can't and the thing is they can't

4309
02:26:23,000 --> 02:26:25,000
complain about it because I did nothing

4310
02:26:25,000 --> 02:26:27,000
uncivil

4311
02:26:27,000 --> 02:26:29,000
she's got great attendance she's shown up to

4312
02:26:29,000 --> 02:26:31,000
most of these shows

4313
02:26:31,000 --> 02:26:33,000
unless I was like dead sick

4314
02:26:33,000 --> 02:26:35,000
I even came here sick a few times

4315
02:26:35,000 --> 02:26:37,000
alright Loki

4316
02:26:37,000 --> 02:26:39,000
F you to Wingstop because

4317
02:26:39,000 --> 02:26:41,000
why does it take 30 minutes for you to

4318
02:26:41,000 --> 02:26:43,000
make wings for us

4319
02:26:43,000 --> 02:26:45,000
I mean 30 minutes

4320
02:26:45,000 --> 02:26:47,000
seriously you fry the wings

4321
02:26:47,000 --> 02:26:49,000
you dip them in sauce

4322
02:26:49,000 --> 02:26:51,000
done! Wingstop is fucking good though

4323
02:26:51,000 --> 02:26:53,000
they're not that great that's not an endorsement

4324
02:26:53,000 --> 02:26:55,000
if I want to eat like if I want food

4325
02:26:55,000 --> 02:26:57,000
that will make me fat that's what I want

4326
02:26:57,000 --> 02:26:59,000
because if I can go to KFC and get the wings

4327
02:26:59,000 --> 02:27:01,000
dipped in sauce

4328
02:27:01,000 --> 02:27:03,000
within the time that I order

4329
02:27:03,000 --> 02:27:05,000
in the drive through and pull up to the window

4330
02:27:05,000 --> 02:27:07,000
it should not take 30 fucking minutes

4331
02:27:07,000 --> 02:27:09,000
to cook wings

4332
02:27:09,000 --> 02:27:11,000
I'm sorry I mean it's like

4333
02:27:11,000 --> 02:27:13,000
you don't fry wings for 30 minutes

4334
02:27:13,000 --> 02:27:15,000
oh

4335
02:27:15,000 --> 02:27:17,000
and their fries fucking suck they're

4336
02:27:17,000 --> 02:27:19,000
soggy stale

4337
02:27:19,000 --> 02:27:21,000
unsalted it was just like some

4338
02:27:21,000 --> 02:27:23,000
of a crap potato into

4339
02:27:23,000 --> 02:27:25,000
a little

4340
02:27:25,000 --> 02:27:27,000
cardboard tray and try to pass it off

4341
02:27:27,000 --> 02:27:29,000
as french fries it was just not

4342
02:27:29,000 --> 02:27:33,000
good

4343
02:27:33,000 --> 02:27:35,000
here we go the food show again

4344
02:27:35,000 --> 02:27:37,000
orange lounge foodie

4345
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:39,000
Nelly wanted to try Wingstop even though

4346
02:27:39,000 --> 02:27:41,000
I've been there and said listen it sucks

4347
02:27:41,000 --> 02:27:43,000
you know we shouldn't go back

4348
02:27:43,000 --> 02:27:45,000
take her to Hooters next time although I did get to try

4349
02:27:45,000 --> 02:27:47,000
for the first time actually going inside and doing one of those

4350
02:27:47,000 --> 02:27:49,000
coke freestyle machines and that was pretty

4351
02:27:49,000 --> 02:27:51,000
those are pretty awesome

4352
02:27:51,000 --> 02:27:53,000
she says we should go in these for our home I'm like

4353
02:27:53,000 --> 02:27:55,000
yes we should

4354
02:27:55,000 --> 02:27:57,000
that's a project you should work on building your own

4355
02:27:57,000 --> 02:27:59,000
oh yeah that'd be expensive

4356
02:27:59,000 --> 02:28:01,000
you could dispense the taurani syrup

4357
02:28:01,000 --> 02:28:03,000
think about it

4358
02:28:03,000 --> 02:28:05,000
I'm gonna give an FU to iMessage

4359
02:28:05,000 --> 02:28:07,000
because we all know

4360
02:28:07,000 --> 02:28:09,000
they're already having some type of bug

4361
02:28:09,000 --> 02:28:11,000
and I've been trying to text message during the show

4362
02:28:11,000 --> 02:28:13,000
and I think iMessage just stopped working

4363
02:28:13,000 --> 02:28:15,000
and I don't know what the hell is going on

4364
02:28:15,000 --> 02:28:17,000
but then one of my other friends sent me a text and I got it fine

4365
02:28:17,000 --> 02:28:19,000
so I'm afraid I can't let you

4366
02:28:19,000 --> 02:28:21,000
iMessage is my FU of the week

4367
02:28:21,000 --> 02:28:23,000
and yes I'm an

4368
02:28:23,000 --> 02:28:25,000
apple sheep and I have an iPhone

4369
02:28:25,000 --> 02:28:27,000
I just want to text message people okay

4370
02:28:27,000 --> 02:28:29,000
you can't text message breakup

4371
02:28:29,000 --> 02:28:31,000
during the show? what?

4372
02:28:31,000 --> 02:28:33,000
did you just

4373
02:28:33,000 --> 02:28:35,000
quote a Kelly song over there? I did

4374
02:28:35,000 --> 02:28:37,000
alright

4375
02:28:37,000 --> 02:28:39,000
just a couple more stories and then Twitter topics

4376
02:28:39,000 --> 02:28:41,000
and the Skype line at 1877

4377
02:28:41,000 --> 02:28:43,000
game OLR

4378
02:28:43,000 --> 02:28:45,000
first Loki

4379
02:28:45,000 --> 02:28:47,000
alright so there's a new

4380
02:28:47,000 --> 02:28:49,000
Kickstarter for a new

4381
02:28:49,000 --> 02:28:51,000
augmented reality glass

4382
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:53,000
thing it's done by some

4383
02:28:53,000 --> 02:28:55,000
ex-Valve employees

4384
02:28:55,000 --> 02:28:57,000
I guess they've reached

4385
02:28:57,000 --> 02:28:59,000
their goal already but they're doing their stretch goals

4386
02:28:59,000 --> 02:29:01,000
what's kind of unique about it is

4387
02:29:01,000 --> 02:29:03,000
it's these shutter glasses

4388
02:29:03,000 --> 02:29:05,000
and they actually have projectors

4389
02:29:05,000 --> 02:29:07,000
so it projects 3D

4390
02:29:07,000 --> 02:29:09,000
images onto

4391
02:29:09,000 --> 02:29:11,000
the environment

4392
02:29:11,000 --> 02:29:13,000
the other thing though that seemed kind of weird though

4393
02:29:13,000 --> 02:29:15,000
is like

4394
02:29:15,000 --> 02:29:17,000
in the video and stuff

4395
02:29:17,000 --> 02:29:19,000
it just didn't seem like

4396
02:29:19,000 --> 02:29:21,000
I mean if you're moving your head and stuff

4397
02:29:21,000 --> 02:29:23,000
the projection kind of change where it's at

4398
02:29:23,000 --> 02:29:25,000
unless it's updating really fast

4399
02:29:25,000 --> 02:29:27,000
I don't know

4400
02:29:27,000 --> 02:29:29,000
I don't know, interesting, don't know what the price point though

4401
02:29:29,000 --> 02:29:31,000
of it is

4402
02:29:31,000 --> 02:29:33,000
certainly I'm not going to back it because

4403
02:29:33,000 --> 02:29:35,000
I don't need to spend money on this kind of crap

4404
02:29:35,000 --> 02:29:37,000
but you kind of want to

4405
02:29:37,000 --> 02:29:39,000
no because it's not expected

4406
02:29:39,000 --> 02:29:41,000
to come out for like a year

4407
02:29:41,000 --> 02:29:43,000
you know a starter package is

4408
02:29:43,000 --> 02:29:45,000
$189

4409
02:29:45,000 --> 02:29:47,000
and you get a cast AR

4410
02:29:47,000 --> 02:29:49,000
oh that's the weird thing about it is you have to have this like

4411
02:29:49,000 --> 02:29:51,000
actually cast onto it's like a

4412
02:29:51,000 --> 02:29:53,000
looks like a fabric

4413
02:29:53,000 --> 02:29:55,000
thing almost like a green screen but it's

4414
02:29:55,000 --> 02:29:57,000
grey so

4415
02:29:57,000 --> 02:29:59,000
it seems like a lot of

4416
02:29:59,000 --> 02:30:01,000
hassle but hey

4417
02:30:01,000 --> 02:30:03,000
maybe if it's cheaper then

4418
02:30:03,000 --> 02:30:05,000
I don't know

4419
02:30:05,000 --> 02:30:07,000
the Oculus Rift it might be

4420
02:30:07,000 --> 02:30:09,000
I think the Rift sounds more interesting because

4421
02:30:09,000 --> 02:30:11,000
it's VR whereas this is augmented reality

4422
02:30:11,000 --> 02:30:13,000
stuff and just I don't really

4423
02:30:13,000 --> 02:30:15,000
care about AR stuff I remember

4424
02:30:15,000 --> 02:30:17,000
trying to pull that shit off with the Vita and

4425
02:30:17,000 --> 02:30:19,000
it sucked remember the Vita what they

4426
02:30:19,000 --> 02:30:21,000
are you know stuff it's like oh

4427
02:30:21,000 --> 02:30:23,000
let me try this soccer game

4428
02:30:23,000 --> 02:30:25,000
wow that's that's shit okay cool

4429
02:30:25,000 --> 02:30:27,000
alright

4430
02:30:27,000 --> 02:30:29,000
one more story for you guys I swear it's like

4431
02:30:29,000 --> 02:30:31,000
it's like Blast from OLR's past

4432
02:30:31,000 --> 02:30:33,000
tonight and I guess Jason kind of referenced that

4433
02:30:33,000 --> 02:30:35,000
in the intro tonight it's kind of true

4434
02:30:35,000 --> 02:30:37,000
because we have one more story here tonight and it's about

4435
02:30:37,000 --> 02:30:39,000
one of our favorite

4436
02:30:39,000 --> 02:30:41,000
DDR knockoffs they ever had

4437
02:30:41,000 --> 02:30:43,000
it was a game called Dance Dance

4438
02:30:43,000 --> 02:30:45,000
Immolation and if you didn't know about

4439
02:30:45,000 --> 02:30:47,000
this game this was the DDR

4440
02:30:47,000 --> 02:30:49,000
game where if you made a misstep it would

4441
02:30:49,000 --> 02:30:51,000
literally set you on fire

4442
02:30:51,000 --> 02:30:53,000
and you're probably wondering how in the hell is this legal

4443
02:30:53,000 --> 02:30:55,000
well A you had

4444
02:30:55,000 --> 02:30:57,000
to wear this hugely flame

4445
02:30:57,000 --> 02:30:59,000
retardant suit and all this stuff to even

4446
02:30:59,000 --> 02:31:01,000
play the game and I'm sure you had to sign waiver after

4447
02:31:01,000 --> 02:31:03,000
waiver and B it was

4448
02:31:03,000 --> 02:31:05,000
the kind of thing that they would just take to Burning Man

4449
02:31:05,000 --> 02:31:07,000
and like that type of like artsy

4450
02:31:07,000 --> 02:31:09,000
stuff that's what you expect to see at Burning Man like that weird

4451
02:31:09,000 --> 02:31:11,000
stuff also

4452
02:31:11,000 --> 02:31:13,000
there were some other festivals Dance Dance Immolation went

4453
02:31:13,000 --> 02:31:15,000
to including the fine arts festival

4454
02:31:15,000 --> 02:31:17,000
a Denmark

4455
02:31:17,000 --> 02:31:19,000
thing called Smuck Fest

4456
02:31:19,000 --> 02:31:21,000
DDR for hipsters

4457
02:31:21,000 --> 02:31:23,000
but anyway

4458
02:31:23,000 --> 02:31:25,000
the game was officially retired

4459
02:31:25,000 --> 02:31:27,000
at Burning Man 2013

4460
02:31:27,000 --> 02:31:29,000
and then the display was

4461
02:31:29,000 --> 02:31:31,000
ripped apart and then in

4462
02:31:31,000 --> 02:31:33,000
true Burning Man what the fuck are they even doing

4463
02:31:33,000 --> 02:31:35,000
anymore fashion and look I have friends that

4464
02:31:35,000 --> 02:31:37,000
go to Burning Man and love it and swear by it and

4465
02:31:37,000 --> 02:31:39,000
I'm not knocking it but I'm just saying

4466
02:31:39,000 --> 02:31:41,000
the randomness

4467
02:31:41,000 --> 02:31:43,000
of some of this shit doesn't help the

4468
02:31:43,000 --> 02:31:45,000
theories that everybody's on drugs there

4469
02:31:45,000 --> 02:31:47,000
I'm just saying

4470
02:31:47,000 --> 02:31:49,000
I'm just saying

4471
02:31:49,000 --> 02:31:51,000
I'm just saying but anyhow

4472
02:31:51,000 --> 02:31:53,000
the way they destroyed it

4473
02:31:53,000 --> 02:31:55,000
what I meant to say is that

4474
02:31:55,000 --> 02:31:57,000
they dropped a piano on it

4475
02:31:57,000 --> 02:31:59,000
actually they dropped

4476
02:31:59,000 --> 02:32:01,000
a piano on what was left and since I know

4477
02:32:01,000 --> 02:32:03,000
Dark Soccer is dying to see

4478
02:32:03,000 --> 02:32:05,000
here it is

4479
02:32:05,000 --> 02:32:07,000
they dropped

4480
02:32:07,000 --> 02:32:09,000
an old

4481
02:32:09,000 --> 02:32:11,000
powder blue upright

4482
02:32:11,000 --> 02:32:13,000
and then

4483
02:32:13,000 --> 02:32:15,000
all the people I need to go to

4484
02:32:15,000 --> 02:32:17,000
Burning Man Rob it's just so fucking hard

4485
02:32:17,000 --> 02:32:19,000
no no

4486
02:32:19,000 --> 02:32:21,000
but

4487
02:32:21,000 --> 02:32:23,000
I love you

4488
02:32:23,000 --> 02:32:25,000
if you want to take drugs and run naked through the desert

4489
02:32:25,000 --> 02:32:27,000
I guess you can do that I love you

4490
02:32:27,000 --> 02:32:29,000
but sometimes

4491
02:32:29,000 --> 02:32:31,000
little things make you pretty

4492
02:32:31,000 --> 02:32:33,000
irritable and going to

4493
02:32:33,000 --> 02:32:35,000
the desert

4494
02:32:35,000 --> 02:32:37,000
for seven days

4495
02:32:37,000 --> 02:32:39,000
I'd probably want to murder everybody

4496
02:32:39,000 --> 02:32:41,000
I don't know where these people

4497
02:32:41,000 --> 02:32:43,000
poop

4498
02:32:43,000 --> 02:32:45,000
they have an RV

4499
02:32:45,000 --> 02:32:47,000
I guess it's RVs or whatever

4500
02:32:47,000 --> 02:32:49,000
there's no such thing as money

4501
02:32:49,000 --> 02:32:51,000
it's a barter system

4502
02:32:51,000 --> 02:32:53,000
Dark Soccer

4503
02:32:53,000 --> 02:32:55,000
I don't think you'd enjoy it

4504
02:32:55,000 --> 02:32:57,000
I think you'd complain a little bit

4505
02:32:57,000 --> 02:32:59,000
I probably wouldn't

4506
02:32:59,000 --> 02:33:01,000
every so often I want to go see

4507
02:33:01,000 --> 02:33:03,000
some of this stuff in person

4508
02:33:03,000 --> 02:33:05,000
and then you just reminded me

4509
02:33:05,000 --> 02:33:07,000
no air conditioning

4510
02:33:07,000 --> 02:33:09,000
fuck that shit I can't stand hot

4511
02:33:09,000 --> 02:33:11,000
and I live in Sacramento

4512
02:33:11,000 --> 02:33:13,000
what am I thinking

4513
02:33:13,000 --> 02:33:15,000
well you're on drugs

4514
02:33:15,000 --> 02:33:17,000
I'm on the drugs that keep me from murdering people

4515
02:33:17,000 --> 02:33:19,000
I just want to make it clear

4516
02:33:19,000 --> 02:33:21,000
I'm just teasing

4517
02:33:21,000 --> 02:33:23,000
I don't want to offend the people because I have friends that go to this

4518
02:33:23,000 --> 02:33:25,000
and they have a great time and they always tell me I should go

4519
02:33:25,000 --> 02:33:27,000
but I'm like my

4520
02:33:27,000 --> 02:33:29,000
red headed ass cannot

4521
02:33:29,000 --> 02:33:31,000
handle seven days

4522
02:33:31,000 --> 02:33:33,000
in the desert

4523
02:33:33,000 --> 02:33:35,000
it's not going to happen

4524
02:33:35,000 --> 02:33:37,000
I will watch the YouTubes

4525
02:33:37,000 --> 02:33:39,000
what if you went through the desert on a horse with no name

4526
02:33:41,000 --> 02:33:43,000
I don't even want to do this show anymore

4527
02:33:43,000 --> 02:33:45,000
alright

4528
02:33:45,000 --> 02:33:47,000
I'm just kidding

4529
02:33:47,000 --> 02:33:49,000
I do want to talk to you on Skype

4530
02:33:49,000 --> 02:33:51,000
maybe you'll have a better topic to talk about

4531
02:33:51,000 --> 02:33:53,000
1-877-GAME-OLR

4532
02:33:53,000 --> 02:33:55,000
talk about Rob's red headed ass

4533
02:33:55,000 --> 02:33:57,000
stop being weird

4534
02:33:57,000 --> 02:33:59,000
our username on Skype

4535
02:33:59,000 --> 02:34:01,000
Orange Lounge Radio

4536
02:34:01,000 --> 02:34:03,000
all one word if you want to give us a call

4537
02:34:03,000 --> 02:34:05,000
Bobby Black Wolf is in our chat room

4538
02:34:05,000 --> 02:34:07,000
saying I go to Dragon Con

4539
02:34:07,000 --> 02:34:09,000
instead of Burning Man

4540
02:34:09,000 --> 02:34:11,000
they're at the same time

4541
02:34:11,000 --> 02:34:13,000
and you know what

4542
02:34:13,000 --> 02:34:15,000
that's my new drug of choice too

4543
02:34:15,000 --> 02:34:17,000
I did really love Dragon Con this year

4544
02:34:17,000 --> 02:34:19,000
I can't wait to go back

4545
02:34:19,000 --> 02:34:21,000
I can poke fun at myself too

4546
02:34:21,000 --> 02:34:23,000
because I said everyone's on drugs at Burning Man

4547
02:34:23,000 --> 02:34:25,000
well at Dragon Con everybody's drunk

4548
02:34:25,000 --> 02:34:27,000
and I say that as a proud Dragon Con attendee

4549
02:34:27,000 --> 02:34:29,000
responsibly

4550
02:34:29,000 --> 02:34:31,000
we're responsibly drunk

4551
02:34:31,000 --> 02:34:33,000
but I'm just saying

4552
02:34:33,000 --> 02:34:35,000
Rob, next year, Fauna Mae

4553
02:34:35,000 --> 02:34:37,000
I really do want to go back to Fauna Mae

4554
02:34:37,000 --> 02:34:39,000
you should cosplay Black Mage

4555
02:34:39,000 --> 02:34:41,000
and I should cosplay White Mage

4556
02:34:41,000 --> 02:34:43,000
which kind of Black Mage

4557
02:34:43,000 --> 02:34:45,000
Classic Black Mage or Final Fantasy XIV

4558
02:34:45,000 --> 02:34:47,000
maybe XIV

4559
02:34:47,000 --> 02:34:49,000
Gamer X2

4560
02:34:49,000 --> 02:34:51,000
Dark Sakura, I've got to take you to Gamer X2

4561
02:34:51,000 --> 02:34:53,000
because I know

4562
02:34:53,000 --> 02:34:55,000
that all my gay gaming

4563
02:34:55,000 --> 02:34:57,000
podcast guys

4564
02:34:57,000 --> 02:34:59,000
want to meet you

4565
02:34:59,000 --> 02:35:01,000
they listen to this show

4566
02:35:01,000 --> 02:35:03,000
they love you

4567
02:35:03,000 --> 02:35:05,000
they like Loki too

4568
02:35:05,000 --> 02:35:07,000
you are the one that tried to make Lolo gay

4569
02:35:07,000 --> 02:35:09,000
let's be real

4570
02:35:09,000 --> 02:35:11,000
look, I can't help it if Lala

4571
02:35:11,000 --> 02:35:13,000
is really a cross dresser

4572
02:35:13,000 --> 02:35:15,000
no I'm kidding

4573
02:35:15,000 --> 02:35:17,000
I don't know if you are listening to these shows

4574
02:35:17,000 --> 02:35:19,000
I don't shout them out enough here on the program

4575
02:35:19,000 --> 02:35:21,000
unfortunately we don't really have a shout out segment

4576
02:35:21,000 --> 02:35:23,000
but I do want to give a shout out to folks

4577
02:35:23,000 --> 02:35:25,000
like Game Buoy, you know them

4578
02:35:25,000 --> 02:35:27,000
very well, right?

4579
02:35:27,000 --> 02:35:29,000
Koopa Club, I don't know if you're listening to them

4580
02:35:29,000 --> 02:35:31,000
but they're a lot of fun, they're out of Chicago

4581
02:35:31,000 --> 02:35:33,000
you would love them

4582
02:35:33,000 --> 02:35:35,000
Video Game Realness, Canadian, hilarious

4583
02:35:35,000 --> 02:35:37,000
they kind of do what we do here

4584
02:35:37,000 --> 02:35:39,000
where they're all at one table in one room

4585
02:35:39,000 --> 02:35:41,000
and they should send us some poutine

4586
02:35:43,000 --> 02:35:45,000
he was bitching about soggy fries

4587
02:35:45,000 --> 02:35:47,000
from Wingstop earlier

4588
02:35:47,000 --> 02:35:49,000
I do not want FedExed poutine

4589
02:35:49,000 --> 02:35:51,000
there's actually a place in town you can get poutine

4590
02:35:51,000 --> 02:35:53,000
alright, Game Bar

4591
02:35:53,000 --> 02:35:55,000
is another one

4592
02:35:55,000 --> 02:35:57,000
no, it's an actual restaurant

4593
02:35:57,000 --> 02:35:59,000
not a strip club

4594
02:35:59,000 --> 02:36:01,000
no, Poon-teen

4595
02:36:01,000 --> 02:36:03,000
I'm sorry

4596
02:36:03,000 --> 02:36:05,000
you're thinking of Poon-teen

4597
02:36:07,000 --> 02:36:09,000
shut up

4598
02:36:09,000 --> 02:36:11,000
we did already have Kirby

4599
02:36:11,000 --> 02:36:13,000
birth 1877

4600
02:36:13,000 --> 02:36:15,000
Game O.L.R. or a username on Skype

4601
02:36:15,000 --> 02:36:17,000
Orange Lounge Radio, you need to call us

4602
02:36:17,000 --> 02:36:19,000
or it's going to be the Poutine Hour

4603
02:36:19,000 --> 02:36:21,000
and Loki may not

4604
02:36:21,000 --> 02:36:23,000
give you what you think that is

4605
02:36:23,000 --> 02:36:25,000
with the Poutine Hour

4606
02:36:25,000 --> 02:36:29,000
or we could go to Last Minute Stories

4607
02:36:29,000 --> 02:36:31,000
while we wait for some calls

4608
02:36:31,000 --> 02:36:33,000
sure, why not

4609
02:36:33,000 --> 02:36:35,000
let's talk about Grand Theft Auto 5

4610
02:36:35,000 --> 02:36:37,000
it's number 2 in Japan

4611
02:36:37,000 --> 02:36:39,000
after debuting

4612
02:36:39,000 --> 02:36:41,000
what was number 1 though, I'm kind of curious

4613
02:36:41,000 --> 02:36:43,000
oh, Pokemon

4614
02:36:43,000 --> 02:36:45,000
anyway, number 2 is not bad

4615
02:36:45,000 --> 02:36:47,000
they're corrupt, y'all

4616
02:36:47,000 --> 02:36:49,000
they are, they're going to have to do something about it

4617
02:36:53,000 --> 02:36:55,000
yeah, that's it

4618
02:36:55,000 --> 02:36:57,000
that's all I got

4619
02:36:57,000 --> 02:36:59,000
there were some stories on

4620
02:36:59,000 --> 02:37:01,000
the Xbox One also is not going to support

4621
02:37:01,000 --> 02:37:03,000
third party headsets at launch

4622
02:37:03,000 --> 02:37:05,000
not until 2014

4623
02:37:05,000 --> 02:37:07,000
there were some

4624
02:37:07,000 --> 02:37:09,000
stories on Zelda this week

4625
02:37:09,000 --> 02:37:11,000
that we didn't get to, and I don't remember what they were

4626
02:37:11,000 --> 02:37:13,000
does it involve Poutine?

4627
02:37:13,000 --> 02:37:15,000
yes

4628
02:37:15,000 --> 02:37:17,000
yes, because Poutine is

4629
02:37:17,000 --> 02:37:19,000
the national food of Hyrule

4630
02:37:19,000 --> 02:37:21,000
if you do the dungeons in a certain order

4631
02:37:21,000 --> 02:37:23,000
you can actually collect the gravy and the

4632
02:37:23,000 --> 02:37:25,000
cheese curd power up

4633
02:37:25,000 --> 02:37:27,000
and go to town

4634
02:37:27,000 --> 02:37:29,000
we have pianos

4635
02:37:29,000 --> 02:37:31,000
dropping on DDR machines that set people on fire

4636
02:37:31,000 --> 02:37:33,000
what

4637
02:37:33,000 --> 02:37:35,000
what, I just haven't done that in a while

4638
02:37:37,000 --> 02:37:39,000
I thought you were cutting sugar out

4639
02:37:39,000 --> 02:37:41,000
of your diet, yet you sound like

4640
02:37:41,000 --> 02:37:43,000
like a four year old that

4641
02:37:43,000 --> 02:37:45,000
just ate a Snickers bar

4642
02:37:45,000 --> 02:37:47,000
because I now have quite stable blood sugar and I'm hyper all the time

4643
02:37:47,000 --> 02:37:49,000
alright, fair enough

4644
02:37:49,000 --> 02:37:51,000
alright, yes, thank you actdeft, I'm going to Twitter topics

4645
02:37:51,000 --> 02:37:53,000
I'm trying, I'm doing Twitter topics

4646
02:37:53,000 --> 02:37:55,000
I want someone to call us

4647
02:37:55,000 --> 02:37:57,000
who hasn't called before

4648
02:37:57,000 --> 02:37:59,000
because I'm running out of things to say Poutine

4649
02:37:59,000 --> 02:38:01,000
about

4650
02:38:01,000 --> 02:38:03,000
that is actually

4651
02:38:03,000 --> 02:38:05,000
true, ssh100map

4652
02:38:05,000 --> 02:38:07,000
you misspelled

4653
02:38:07,000 --> 02:38:09,000
p-o-u-t-i-n-e, Poutine

4654
02:38:09,000 --> 02:38:11,000
and dongles

4655
02:38:11,000 --> 02:38:13,000
those are like two, you know another word that makes me

4656
02:38:13,000 --> 02:38:15,000
giggle like that, balls

4657
02:38:17,000 --> 02:38:19,000
I'm turning dark side with my stuff

4658
02:38:19,000 --> 02:38:21,000
oh thank god, we're getting a call

4659
02:38:21,000 --> 02:38:23,000
thank the lord

4660
02:38:23,000 --> 02:38:25,000
somebody's going to help us talk about something

4661
02:38:25,000 --> 02:38:27,000
maybe Canadian, maybe not, I don't know

4662
02:38:27,000 --> 02:38:29,000
hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio, who's this?

4663
02:38:29,000 --> 02:38:31,000
hey, this is Zappi, and I officially endorse Poutine

4664
02:38:31,000 --> 02:38:33,000
what's that?

4665
02:38:33,000 --> 02:38:35,000
I officially endorse Poutine

4666
02:38:35,000 --> 02:38:37,000
are you Canadian?

4667
02:38:37,000 --> 02:38:39,000
I'm from French Canada, so it's really

4668
02:38:39,000 --> 02:38:41,000
I love Poutine so much

4669
02:38:41,000 --> 02:38:43,000
god dammit

4670
02:38:43,000 --> 02:38:45,000
and I haven't had it since Louisiana

4671
02:38:45,000 --> 02:38:47,000
alright Zappi, have a great night

4672
02:38:47,000 --> 02:38:49,000
no, I'm just kidding

4673
02:38:49,000 --> 02:38:51,000
what did you call in to talk to us about tonight, Zappi?

4674
02:38:51,000 --> 02:38:53,000
well, besides Poutine, I was

4675
02:38:53,000 --> 02:38:55,000
going to talk about me playing the Xbox One

4676
02:38:55,000 --> 02:38:57,000
this week

4677
02:38:57,000 --> 02:38:59,000
why, how'd that happen?

4678
02:38:59,000 --> 02:39:01,000
well, I just went to my local Best Buy

4679
02:39:01,000 --> 02:39:03,000
and lo and behold, they just had an Xbox One demo out

4680
02:39:03,000 --> 02:39:05,000
I went into my local

4681
02:39:05,000 --> 02:39:07,000
Best Buy, and like, I had to ask

4682
02:39:07,000 --> 02:39:09,000
to get a copy of Pokemon, why

4683
02:39:09,000 --> 02:39:11,000
like, may I buy a copy of Pokemon

4684
02:39:11,000 --> 02:39:13,000
because I don't see it on the shelf

4685
02:39:13,000 --> 02:39:15,000
I didn't see no Xbox Ones or PlayStations

4686
02:39:15,000 --> 02:39:17,000
apparently they got their shit together in Canada

4687
02:39:17,000 --> 02:39:19,000
you know why? Everyone's happy

4688
02:39:19,000 --> 02:39:21,000
because they're eating french fries smothered in gravy

4689
02:39:21,000 --> 02:39:23,000
and, cheese curds

4690
02:39:23,000 --> 02:39:25,000
alright, well I hate to break it to you, but they had no Pokemon

4691
02:39:25,000 --> 02:39:27,000
oh

4692
02:39:27,000 --> 02:39:29,000
dicks, I'm just kidding, alright

4693
02:39:29,000 --> 02:39:31,000
is that why you went there?

4694
02:39:31,000 --> 02:39:33,000
we're moving to Canada tomorrow, by the way

4695
02:39:33,000 --> 02:39:35,000
so you went there, Zappi, to get Pokemon

4696
02:39:35,000 --> 02:39:37,000
and you ended up with Xbox One?

4697
02:39:37,000 --> 02:39:39,000
well, I was going to get the Pokemon from my boyfriend

4698
02:39:39,000 --> 02:39:41,000
and, no

4699
02:39:41,000 --> 02:39:43,000
oh, ok, alright

4700
02:39:43,000 --> 02:39:45,000
well, how was the Xbox One?

4701
02:39:45,000 --> 02:39:47,000
what'd you play?

4702
02:39:47,000 --> 02:39:49,000
they had fours of five

4703
02:39:49,000 --> 02:39:51,000
oh, ok, cool

4704
02:39:51,000 --> 02:39:53,000
I'll say this, it's very pretty

4705
02:39:53,000 --> 02:39:55,000
but there's one thing that really has me concerned

4706
02:39:55,000 --> 02:39:57,000
they had this demo unit

4707
02:39:57,000 --> 02:39:59,000
that looked like a complete factory finished Xbox

4708
02:39:59,000 --> 02:40:01,000
and the game was stuttering

4709
02:40:01,000 --> 02:40:03,000
like no tomorrow

4710
02:40:03,000 --> 02:40:05,000
really?

4711
02:40:05,000 --> 02:40:07,000
it's because it's not actually, it's just

4712
02:40:07,000 --> 02:40:09,000
the PC and the

4713
02:40:09,000 --> 02:40:11,000
units, I don't think it's actually the

4714
02:40:11,000 --> 02:40:13,000
well, actually it's the test units, I think

4715
02:40:13,000 --> 02:40:15,000
they had like a clear

4716
02:40:15,000 --> 02:40:17,000
container for it, it looked like

4717
02:40:17,000 --> 02:40:19,000
a finished Xbox One

4718
02:40:19,000 --> 02:40:21,000
but it's probably not a finished version of the game, remember

4719
02:40:21,000 --> 02:40:23,000
fours of five isn't done yet, they need to

4720
02:40:23,000 --> 02:40:25,000
patch in the rest of the game when it comes out

4721
02:40:25,000 --> 02:40:27,000
we're only a month out, too, I mean

4722
02:40:27,000 --> 02:40:29,000
I would think that the real deal is starting to show up

4723
02:40:29,000 --> 02:40:31,000
but this is the copy

4724
02:40:31,000 --> 02:40:33,000
that they were confident enough to bring to a retail

4725
02:40:33,000 --> 02:40:35,000
store and have people try out

4726
02:40:35,000 --> 02:40:37,000
and you know, and funny

4727
02:40:37,000 --> 02:40:39,000
enough, I was teasing Bobby Blackwolf

4728
02:40:39,000 --> 02:40:41,000
because he has the show before us here at VOG Network

4729
02:40:41,000 --> 02:40:43,000
and I was teasing him earlier because he was talking

4730
02:40:43,000 --> 02:40:45,000
about demos, and I said, well you know, Bobby

4731
02:40:45,000 --> 02:40:47,000
he will make his

4732
02:40:47,000 --> 02:40:49,000
impression off a video game based off the demo

4733
02:40:49,000 --> 02:40:51,000
and that's that, because I think back to Nino Cooney

4734
02:40:51,000 --> 02:40:53,000
and how he refuses to play that full game

4735
02:40:53,000 --> 02:40:55,000
because the demo was so awful, which it was

4736
02:40:55,000 --> 02:40:57,000
but the game's really good

4737
02:40:57,000 --> 02:40:59,000
I bring that up because, you know, if you're gonna

4738
02:40:59,000 --> 02:41:01,000
make your impressions off this in-store

4739
02:41:01,000 --> 02:41:03,000
demo unit, then yeah, it should run

4740
02:41:03,000 --> 02:41:05,000
a little better than being stuttery all over

4741
02:41:05,000 --> 02:41:07,000
the place

4742
02:41:07,000 --> 02:41:09,000
besides that, it was very pretty

4743
02:41:09,000 --> 02:41:11,000
the controller is really awesome, I want one of those

4744
02:41:11,000 --> 02:41:13,000
and it plays like

4745
02:41:13,000 --> 02:41:15,000
Forza

4746
02:41:15,000 --> 02:41:17,000
but more like the old Forzas

4747
02:41:17,000 --> 02:41:19,000
and not like Forza Horizon Arcady, right?

4748
02:41:19,000 --> 02:41:21,000
no, no, it's like the numbered

4749
02:41:21,000 --> 02:41:23,000
Forza games

4750
02:41:23,000 --> 02:41:25,000
fair enough, were they

4751
02:41:25,000 --> 02:41:27,000
showing anything else, like Killer Instinct or any of that

4752
02:41:27,000 --> 02:41:29,000
or just Forza?

4753
02:41:29,000 --> 02:41:31,000
nope, it was the Forza show

4754
02:41:31,000 --> 02:41:33,000
they had two reps they probably trained over the

4755
02:41:33,000 --> 02:41:35,000
weekend showing it off

4756
02:41:35,000 --> 02:41:37,000
fair enough

4757
02:41:37,000 --> 02:41:39,000
I was gonna say though

4758
02:41:39,000 --> 02:41:41,000
since we were talking about Pokemon a minute ago

4759
02:41:41,000 --> 02:41:43,000
have you tried playing the Pokemon in 3D?

4760
02:41:43,000 --> 02:41:45,000
it kind of stutters too

4761
02:41:45,000 --> 02:41:47,000
yeah, that was a little bit disappointing

4762
02:41:47,000 --> 02:41:49,000
as soon as you turn off the 3D, it's perfectly fine

4763
02:41:49,000 --> 02:41:51,000
but

4764
02:41:51,000 --> 02:41:53,000
I guess that's why the whole game

4765
02:41:53,000 --> 02:41:55,000
isn't in 3D to begin with

4766
02:41:55,000 --> 02:41:57,000
they want you to not notice

4767
02:41:57,000 --> 02:41:59,000
I guess so

4768
02:41:59,000 --> 02:42:01,000
it's kind of interesting

4769
02:42:01,000 --> 02:42:03,000
at the end of the day though

4770
02:42:03,000 --> 02:42:05,000
maybe we are hitting that point

4771
02:42:05,000 --> 02:42:07,000
because it's no big deal

4772
02:42:07,000 --> 02:42:09,000
I don't feel short handed

4773
02:42:09,000 --> 02:42:11,000
or like I'm losing something by not having the 3D

4774
02:42:11,000 --> 02:42:13,000
you know what I mean?

4775
02:42:13,000 --> 02:42:15,000
Dark Sakura, what the hell are you doing in chat?

4776
02:42:15,000 --> 02:42:17,000
I don't know, I tried to put like one stupid little link

4777
02:42:17,000 --> 02:42:19,000
and the whole thing copied

4778
02:42:19,000 --> 02:42:21,000
and Dark Sakura got kicked for flooding the chat

4779
02:42:21,000 --> 02:42:23,000
you know what?

4780
02:42:23,000 --> 02:42:25,000
she was speaking in tongues

4781
02:42:25,000 --> 02:42:27,000
that was actually a complete and total accident

4782
02:42:27,000 --> 02:42:29,000
whoops, alright

4783
02:42:29,000 --> 02:42:31,000
good job Dark Sakura

4784
02:42:31,000 --> 02:42:33,000
sorry Zappi

4785
02:42:33,000 --> 02:42:35,000
well the thing is, sure, 3D isn't that useful

4786
02:42:35,000 --> 02:42:37,000
but this is what they sold the system on

4787
02:42:37,000 --> 02:42:39,000
you have 3D games

4788
02:42:39,000 --> 02:42:41,000
and it looks like they're moving away from the thing

4789
02:42:41,000 --> 02:42:43,000
they were selling their own system on

4790
02:42:43,000 --> 02:42:45,000
well, what's the verdict for you?

4791
02:42:45,000 --> 02:42:47,000
are you on board with next gen gaming?

4792
02:42:47,000 --> 02:42:49,000
are you gonna get an Xbox One

4793
02:42:49,000 --> 02:42:51,000
or a Playstation 4?

4794
02:42:51,000 --> 02:42:53,000
well I'm considering it just because

4795
02:42:53,000 --> 02:42:55,000
I was able to pre-order an Xbox One

4796
02:42:55,000 --> 02:42:57,000
for $100 off

4797
02:42:59,000 --> 02:43:01,000
because I just used the staples to

4798
02:43:01,000 --> 02:43:03,000
stack a whole bunch of coupons

4799
02:43:03,000 --> 02:43:05,000
so you're gonna go

4800
02:43:05,000 --> 02:43:07,000
Xbox One with that money off then?

4801
02:43:07,000 --> 02:43:09,000
I'm thinking about it, because $400

4802
02:43:09,000 --> 02:43:11,000
it puts it at the same price as a PS4

4803
02:43:11,000 --> 02:43:13,000
that's true, if you can lessen the price

4804
02:43:13,000 --> 02:43:15,000
Xbox One does have

4805
02:43:15,000 --> 02:43:17,000
some exclusives that are

4806
02:43:17,000 --> 02:43:19,000
worth looking at

4807
02:43:19,000 --> 02:43:21,000
yeah, but on the other hand

4808
02:43:21,000 --> 02:43:23,000
the launch line up just isn't there

4809
02:43:23,000 --> 02:43:25,000
yeah, I hear ya

4810
02:43:25,000 --> 02:43:27,000
he's waiting six months, so there's nothing wrong with that

4811
02:43:27,000 --> 02:43:29,000
alright, well Zappi, I'm gonna let you go

4812
02:43:29,000 --> 02:43:31,000
to see if anybody else calls, but thanks for calling

4813
02:43:31,000 --> 02:43:33,000
I don't think we've heard from you in forever

4814
02:43:33,000 --> 02:43:35,000
and it's good to hear the impressions of the Xbox One

4815
02:43:35,000 --> 02:43:37,000
alright, cool, later

4816
02:43:37,000 --> 02:43:39,000
next time, Pre-Poutine

4817
02:43:39,000 --> 02:43:41,000
alright, sounds good, bye

4818
02:43:41,000 --> 02:43:43,000
bye

4821
02:43:47,000 --> 02:43:49,000
I figured out what it did

4822
02:43:49,000 --> 02:43:51,000
it actually copied the image data and not the URL

4823
02:43:51,000 --> 02:43:53,000
I have no idea how that happened

4824
02:43:53,000 --> 02:43:55,000
because I highlighted the URL to copy it

4825
02:43:55,000 --> 02:43:57,000
so

4826
02:43:57,000 --> 02:43:59,000

we need more poutine

4831
02:44:07,000 --> 02:44:09,000
I'm trying to go to tweets and see what else has been tweeted at us tonight

4832
02:44:09,000 --> 02:44:11,000
someone new should call us, I want new

4833
02:44:11,000 --> 02:44:13,000
I mean, I love all of you people

4834
02:44:13,000 --> 02:44:15,000
seriously, and I love talking with you, but we need someone new calling

4835
02:44:15,000 --> 02:44:17,000
new voices, new blood

4836
02:44:17,000 --> 02:44:19,000
we must sacrifice you to my iPad

4837
02:44:19,000 --> 02:44:21,000
so that

4838
02:44:21,000 --> 02:44:23,000
it doesn't spout

4839
02:44:23,000 --> 02:44:25,000
devil noise at us, again

4840
02:44:25,000 --> 02:44:27,000
actdef sent us a tweet, but it's a tweet from Eurogamer

4841
02:44:27,000 --> 02:44:29,000
about the extension of the games for gold

4842
02:44:29,000 --> 02:44:31,000
on 360, which I think we had talked about earlier

4843
02:44:31,000 --> 02:44:33,000
I was trying to see if there was more games

4844
02:44:33,000 --> 02:44:35,000
announced on it, but I don't think so

4845
02:44:35,000 --> 02:44:37,000
I didn't realize they got the exact same games in Europe

4846
02:44:37,000 --> 02:44:39,000
but I guess that makes sense, that they do

4847
02:44:39,000 --> 02:44:41,000
um, Sturlock

4848
02:44:41,000 --> 02:44:43,000
tweeted us saying, what was the music from tonight

4849
02:44:43,000 --> 02:44:45,000
very awesome, well clearly

4850
02:44:45,000 --> 02:44:47,000
you're talking about the song Always by

4851
02:44:47,000 --> 02:44:49,000
Erasure, it's what we play during the FUGL

4852
02:44:49,000 --> 02:44:51,000
we need more Erasure on the show

4853
02:44:51,000 --> 02:44:53,000
we do, I can make that happen

4854
02:44:53,000 --> 02:44:55,000
don't, uh, don't think I won't

4855
02:44:55,000 --> 02:44:57,000
I think that's it for Twitter topics, I didn't get a whole lot tonight

4856
02:44:57,000 --> 02:44:59,000
so, twitter.com slash OLR

4857
02:44:59,000 --> 02:45:01,000
we need a new ending song

4858

and it should be all through the years

4859
02:45:03,000 --> 02:45:05,000
alright, I'm gonna put out one more

4860
02:45:05,000 --> 02:45:07,000
call for phone calls, and then we're gonna

4861
02:45:07,000 --> 02:45:09,000
wrap it up, no, you should call tonight

4862
02:45:09,000 --> 02:45:11,000

02:45:21,000 --> 02:45:23,000
food stories somebody wants to tell

4869
02:45:23,000 --> 02:45:25,000
poutine

4870
02:45:25,000 --> 02:45:27,000
I think they have that actually over at sprouts

4871
02:45:27,000 --> 02:45:29,000
they, or even like uh, Whole Foods

4872
02:45:29,000 --> 02:45:31,000
or something like that, they have like their weird food over there

4873
02:45:31,000 --> 02:45:33,000
I could just make it at home

4874
02:45:33,000 --> 02:45:35,000
yeah, it's not that difficult

4875
02:45:35,000 --> 02:45:37,000
let's just sacrifice your face first

4876
02:45:37,000 --> 02:45:39,000
alright, degenerate Johnny

4877
02:45:39,000 --> 02:45:41,000
alright, well I guess nobody wants to call

4878
02:45:41,000 --> 02:45:43,000
that makes me sad, so I'm gonna close up the skype line

4879
02:45:43,000 --> 02:45:45,000
and I will encourage you guys to email us in a future week

4880
02:45:45,000 --> 02:45:47,000
mailbag at orange lounge radio dot com

4881
02:45:47,000 --> 02:45:49,000
or you can also send us a tweet

4882
02:45:49,000 --> 02:45:51,000
twitter dot com slash OLR

4883
02:45:51,000 --> 02:45:53,000
and uh, those are all the ways you can interact with us as well

4884
02:45:53,000 --> 02:45:55,000
uh, otherwise

4885
02:45:55,000 --> 02:45:57,000
that does it for another week of orange lounge radio

4886
02:45:57,000 --> 02:45:59,000
I just wanna say thank you guys

4887
02:45:59,000 --> 02:46:01,000
very much for listening to the show

4888
02:46:01,000 --> 02:46:03,000
um, the nominating stuff is over

4889
02:46:03,000 --> 02:46:05,000
for the podcast awards, but I do wanna give a quick

4890
02:46:05,000 --> 02:46:07,000
thank you, if you did take the time out of your day to nominate us

4891
02:46:07,000 --> 02:46:09,000
or at least nominate another deserving

4892
02:46:09,000 --> 02:46:11,000
independent podcast, even if it wasn't

4893
02:46:11,000 --> 02:46:13,000
us, I wanna say thank you

4894
02:46:13,000 --> 02:46:15,000
and uh, we'll know the results of that, I think

4895
02:46:15,000 --> 02:46:17,000
I think it's the same time as the show next week

4896
02:46:17,000 --> 02:46:19,000
so that could be interesting

4897
02:46:19,000 --> 02:46:21,000
so we can have our disappointment

4898
02:46:21,000 --> 02:46:23,000
drinks when we don't get nominated

4899
02:46:23,000 --> 02:46:25,000
we'll have a pile of poutine that we'll drown our sorrows in

4900
02:46:25,000 --> 02:46:27,000
yes, fist bump

4901
02:46:27,000 --> 02:46:29,000
poutine

4902
02:46:29,000 --> 02:46:31,000
do you want some poutine, Loki?

4903
02:46:31,000 --> 02:46:33,000
is that part of your diet?

4904
02:46:33,000 --> 02:46:35,000
budget for it

4905
02:46:35,000 --> 02:46:37,000
I don't think there's a ketogenic version of poutine

4906
02:46:37,000 --> 02:46:39,000
just budget for it, that's all you have to do

4907
02:46:39,000 --> 02:46:41,000
alright, um, thank you very much

4908
02:46:41,000 --> 02:46:43,000
for listening to our show

4909
02:46:43,000 --> 02:46:45,000
if you like what you heard here at orange lounge radio

4910
02:46:45,000 --> 02:46:47,000
we don't ask for your money, all we do

4911
02:46:47,000 --> 02:46:49,000
just tell a friend or 5 or 25

4912
02:46:49,000 --> 02:46:51,000
about the program, help us spread the word

4913
02:46:51,000 --> 02:46:53,000
about OLR and grow our family

4914
02:46:53,000 --> 02:46:55,000
cause you know what, we've got some pretty cool people

4915
02:46:55,000 --> 02:46:57,000
that listen to this show, both live

4916
02:46:57,000 --> 02:46:59,000
and in the podcast forum, thank you very much

4917
02:46:59,000 --> 02:47:01,000
for participating and being a part of it

4918
02:47:01,000 --> 02:47:03,000
thank you very much

4919
02:47:03,000 --> 02:47:05,000
you could also leave us a nice review on itunes

4920
02:47:05,000 --> 02:47:07,000
stitcher, thumbs up, you know, all the places where you found this podcast

4921
02:47:07,000 --> 02:47:09,000
other people will find podcasts too

4922
02:47:09,000 --> 02:47:11,000
um, it's time to go around and get everybody's final thought

4923
02:47:11,000 --> 02:47:13,000
Loki, starting us off tonight, your final thought

4924
02:47:13,000 --> 02:47:15,000
uh, well

4925
02:47:15,000 --> 02:47:17,000
we'll be playing more grant the thought of this week

4926
02:47:17,000 --> 02:47:19,000
and hopefully you should see an announcement

4927
02:47:19,000 --> 02:47:21,000
about the next game night

4928
02:47:21,000 --> 02:47:23,000
we'll maybe do another game night

4929
02:47:23,000 --> 02:47:25,000
or maybe we'll do like one week

4930
02:47:25,000 --> 02:47:27,000
cause friday seems to be a lot better

4931
02:47:27,000 --> 02:47:29,000
for people, cause it's hard to

4932
02:47:29,000 --> 02:47:31,000
play, so maybe

4933
02:47:31,000 --> 02:47:33,000
maybe we'll do another game night friday

4934
02:47:33,000 --> 02:47:35,000
and then we'll switch it up to the next platform

4935
02:47:35,000 --> 02:47:37,000
the next friday or something like that

4936
02:47:37,000 --> 02:47:39,000
switch off until

4937
02:47:39,000 --> 02:47:41,000
you know, some other games come out

4938
02:47:41,000 --> 02:47:43,000
um, my final thought tonight is

4939
02:47:43,000 --> 02:47:45,000
um, I don't know

4940
02:47:45,000 --> 02:47:47,000
uh, I

4941
02:47:47,000 --> 02:47:49,000
uh, I need to get working on my halloween costume

4942
02:47:49,000 --> 02:47:51,000
cause I haven't started yet and I really need to do that

4943
02:47:51,000 --> 02:47:53,000
and I need to not slack off

4944
02:47:53,000 --> 02:47:55,000
and also I need to do more live game streaming

4945
02:47:55,000 --> 02:47:57,000
cause I've been slacking off on that too, so

4946
02:47:57,000 --> 02:47:59,000
uh, even though I was joking earlier about

4947
02:47:59,000 --> 02:48:01,000
how everybody's live streaming, oh well

4948
02:48:01,000 --> 02:48:03,000
I'm gonna do it too, cause there's some other

4949
02:48:03,000 --> 02:48:05,000
games out there I'm playing that I wanna show you guys

4950
02:48:05,000 --> 02:48:07,000
that aren't just Final Fantasy XIV, believe it or not

4951
02:48:07,000 --> 02:48:09,000
and last but not least, Dark Soccer, your final thought tonight

4952
02:48:09,000 --> 02:48:11,000
the closest thing I have to cheese

4953
02:48:11,000 --> 02:48:13,000
courage is cottage cheese

4954
02:48:13,000 --> 02:48:15,000
that sucks

4955
02:48:15,000 --> 02:48:17,000
could you put cottage cheese on french fries?

4956
02:48:17,000 --> 02:48:19,000
I can't eat french fries

4957
02:48:19,000 --> 02:48:21,000
oh, alright

4958
02:48:21,000 --> 02:48:23,000
you know what?

4959
02:48:23,000 --> 02:48:25,000
I feel healthier

4960
02:48:25,000 --> 02:48:27,000
I feel healthier than I have in the last three weeks

4961
02:48:27,000 --> 02:48:29,000
and I wanna start

4962
02:48:29,000 --> 02:48:31,000
playing DDR again, that's my final thought

4963
02:48:31,000 --> 02:48:33,000
alright, good luck

4964
02:48:33,000 --> 02:48:35,000
I wanna make it a thing

4965
02:48:35,000 --> 02:48:37,000
alright, well

4966
02:48:37,000 --> 02:48:39,000
that's the end of this thing for tonight

4967
02:48:39,000 --> 02:48:41,000
we'll be back next Sunday, seven days

4968
02:48:41,000 --> 02:48:43,000
to do it all over again, yet another thing
