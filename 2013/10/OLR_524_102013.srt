1
00:00:15,663 --> 00:00:22,735
[SPEAKER_05]: A former would-be dancing game slips down and seeks a modern revival, and the creators of Missing Ribbon announce their latest adventure game.

2
00:00:23,055 --> 00:00:26,301
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything old is new again on tonight's episode, which begins right now.

3
00:00:31,809 --> 00:00:37,010
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

4
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:45,132
[SPEAKER_06]: It is Orange Lounge Radio for this episode number 524, October the 20th of 2013.

5
00:00:45,772 --> 00:00:51,173
[SPEAKER_06]: My name is Rob Roberts, here to talk with you about the latest and greatest in the video gaming world with my co-hosts.

6
00:00:51,353 --> 00:00:54,254
[SPEAKER_06]: First off, say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

7
00:00:54,884 --> 00:00:55,905
[SPEAKER_02]: I have the coffee jitters.

8
00:00:56,145 --> 00:00:56,985
[SPEAKER_06]: A coffee jitter?

9
00:00:57,046 --> 00:00:57,446
[SPEAKER_06]: What is that?

10
00:00:57,526 --> 00:00:58,507
[SPEAKER_06]: What is the coffee jitters?

11
00:00:58,727 --> 00:01:03,370
[SPEAKER_02]: I had, granted it was decaf, but I still had a venti americano before I came over.

12
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:03,830
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

13
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:07,212
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I had coffee just now, and I've had lamb.

14
00:01:07,453 --> 00:01:08,153
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you want another.

15
00:01:08,673 --> 00:01:08,854
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

16
00:01:09,454 --> 00:01:09,814
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm good.

17
00:01:09,934 --> 00:01:10,795
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't want any more coffee?

18
00:01:11,435 --> 00:01:13,677
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought that's how you fix the coffee jitters, was with more coffee.

19
00:01:14,218 --> 00:01:15,700
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm actually quite good.

20
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:16,301
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

21
00:01:16,762 --> 00:01:20,026
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you sure you're not going to be driving home and then, Dan, coffee.

22
00:01:20,106 --> 00:01:22,269
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got coffee at home if it comes to that.

23
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:24,913
[SPEAKER_06]: Old OLR in-joke for those that don't know.

24
00:01:25,333 --> 00:01:26,475
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob!

25
00:01:27,202 --> 00:01:28,503
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a few of those here.

26
00:01:28,543 --> 00:01:30,685
[SPEAKER_06]: We have been doing this show for quite a long time.

27
00:01:31,806 --> 00:01:33,228
[SPEAKER_06]: Our longest running inside joke.

28
00:01:33,248 --> 00:01:35,289
[SPEAKER_06]: Say hello everybody to Tech Master Loki.

29
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:35,710
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi.

30
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:36,871
[SPEAKER_06]: How you doing, Loki?

31
00:01:37,271 --> 00:01:37,912
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm doing fine.

32
00:01:38,012 --> 00:01:38,593
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just kidding.

33
00:01:38,653 --> 00:01:40,274
[SPEAKER_06]: I just didn't have any other good transition.

34
00:01:40,574 --> 00:01:41,195
[SPEAKER_06]: How have you been?

35
00:01:42,676 --> 00:01:43,457
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

36
00:01:44,118 --> 00:01:44,558
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah?

37
00:01:44,798 --> 00:01:46,200
[SPEAKER_06]: Anything new and exciting going on?

38
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:48,502
[SPEAKER_06]: What's your latest projects you've been working on?

39
00:01:48,862 --> 00:01:50,804
[SPEAKER_06]: You are, after all, the man of many projects.

40
00:01:52,004 --> 00:01:52,885
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, let's see.

41
00:01:53,005 --> 00:01:55,726
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm still trying to work on finishing up.

42
00:01:55,886 --> 00:01:56,947
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, that's what I'm doing right now.

43
00:01:56,967 --> 00:01:58,387
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm looking for a 12-volt battery.

44
00:01:59,528 --> 00:02:06,631
[SPEAKER_07]: Just that separate screen thing, the wireless second screen for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

45
00:02:06,771 --> 00:02:07,111
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, right.

46
00:02:07,131 --> 00:02:08,472
[SPEAKER_06]: You talked about that a couple weeks back.

47
00:02:08,492 --> 00:02:09,032
[SPEAKER_06]: How's that going?

48
00:02:09,372 --> 00:02:10,213
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

49
00:02:26,508 --> 00:02:48,256
[SPEAKER_07]: so I'm just trying to find something that's got somewhat decent battery life and I don't know I took apart my wireless HDMI receiver the other day and thankfully it's actually the board inside it's a lot smaller than I thought it would be and they have like a daughter board on there as well so it's going to be easy to take apart and then I don't know

50
00:02:48,789 --> 00:02:53,310
[SPEAKER_06]: Once you get this second screen project of yours finished, what's the first thing you're going to do with it?

51
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:55,250
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, what's the first game you're going to play with it?

52
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:56,911
[SPEAKER_06]: Grand Theft Auto V, of course.

53
00:02:57,371 --> 00:03:00,571
[SPEAKER_06]: Because, you know, that tells me what's the whole point of this project.

54
00:03:01,892 --> 00:03:11,374
[SPEAKER_07]: But here's the thing, though, is I don't really need it anymore because I have a setup in my living room where I have my office chair there and my computer monitor since I don't really have a computer on.

55
00:03:11,414 --> 00:03:12,934
[SPEAKER_07]: So I actually play Grand Theft Auto on that.

56
00:03:13,754 --> 00:03:20,000
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, so technically I don't really need it anymore because I still have a screen to play it on while my wife watches TV.

57
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,881
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm still going to build it.

58
00:03:21,901 --> 00:03:23,402
[SPEAKER_06]: That's fair.

59
00:03:23,442 --> 00:03:24,463
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it's a thing.

60
00:03:24,944 --> 00:03:28,847
[SPEAKER_06]: It's become a thing and now you have to see it through to completion.

61
00:03:28,927 --> 00:03:35,772
[SPEAKER_07]: I had to prototype something this week that it's some thing that they're planning on or trying to sell or something.

62
00:03:36,313 --> 00:03:36,633
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like a...

63
00:03:37,754 --> 00:03:46,516
[SPEAKER_07]: Some will figure with like a USB, like Wi-Fi and Bluetooth adapters built into it and a thumb drive or something.

64
00:03:47,597 --> 00:03:49,057
[SPEAKER_07]: So I got to play with that this week.

65
00:03:49,097 --> 00:03:50,438
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, I do want to make this.

66
00:03:50,478 --> 00:03:55,039
[SPEAKER_07]: The thing I got to do after I get all the parts.

67
00:03:55,079 --> 00:04:02,101
[SPEAKER_07]: So really only parts I have left are the battery and probably a 12 volt step down to 5 volt.

68
00:04:04,122 --> 00:04:23,156
[SPEAKER_07]: and then some miscellaneous ports and wires and then once that's all done and I figure out how I want to be laid out I have to get the wood to build a mold or yeah sort of I guess a mold for vacuum forming I have to build the vacuum forming rig which that's easy because that's just a box so

69
00:04:25,117 --> 00:04:25,637
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my gosh.

70
00:04:25,718 --> 00:04:26,018
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

71
00:04:26,178 --> 00:04:26,918
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

72
00:04:27,119 --> 00:04:28,239
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go to our chat room.

73
00:04:28,259 --> 00:04:36,705
[SPEAKER_06]: We do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.

74
00:04:36,805 --> 00:04:42,930
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you are listening live on this Sunday, you can join us in our live chat room, live.vognetwork.com.

75
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:50,635
[SPEAKER_06]: And Ragenator wanting to know in chat, what baconified food product did Loki bring to the OLR studio tonight?

76
00:04:50,996 --> 00:04:52,897
[SPEAKER_06]: If it's your first time ever listening to OLR...

77
00:04:53,277 --> 00:04:55,079
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

78
00:05:15,421 --> 00:05:16,322
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, meat salad.

79
00:05:17,283 --> 00:05:20,626
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't bring anything with bacon on it just because I wasn't that hungry.

80
00:05:20,947 --> 00:05:25,251
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I just kind of got – it's a two-cheeseburger meal from McDonald's because it's cheap.

81
00:05:25,512 --> 00:05:31,398
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't really need to eat anything, but I know because the last time I skipped dinner, I was just like, oh, I'm not hungry.

82
00:05:31,418 --> 00:05:32,018
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to skip dinner.

83
00:05:32,038 --> 00:05:34,061
[SPEAKER_07]: And then when I got home at 10 o'clock, I was hungry.

84
00:05:34,761 --> 00:05:37,284
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just – I got something kind of small.

85
00:05:38,846 --> 00:05:42,129
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I don't really like going to McDonald's in the evening because their fries are stale.

86
00:05:42,449 --> 00:05:44,031
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, their fries were stale again.

87
00:05:44,391 --> 00:05:47,754
[SPEAKER_07]: I ate them anyways, but they were stale and I'm not enjoying that.

88
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:49,616
[SPEAKER_07]: And their burgers weren't even that good either.

89
00:05:49,656 --> 00:05:52,519
[SPEAKER_07]: So it was just kind of eating just to be full.

90
00:05:52,939 --> 00:05:53,700
[SPEAKER_07]: That's pretty much it.

91
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,180
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love to see you bring some In-N-Out.

92
00:05:56,741 --> 00:06:05,823
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I would, but to reliably get here on time with In-N-Out, it's just a crapshoot because I can't tell how busy they're going to be, and sometimes it's like 30 minutes to get out of there.

93
00:06:06,023 --> 00:06:09,504
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I just didn't do that.

94
00:06:09,704 --> 00:06:12,325
[SPEAKER_07]: Although I did eat just bacon the other day for lunch.

95
00:06:12,405 --> 00:06:15,686
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all I had was bacon, so I guess that counts.

96
00:06:16,466 --> 00:06:19,907
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I ran out of bacon because we had to eat the whole package before it was gone.

97
00:06:20,427 --> 00:06:22,008
[SPEAKER_07]: My wife says, well, you ate all the bacon.

98
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:23,669
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, dude, I only had like three pieces.

99
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:26,852
[SPEAKER_06]: So you ate all the bacon.

100
00:06:27,252 --> 00:06:27,892
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

101
00:06:29,113 --> 00:06:32,095
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, your weakness for bacon is like my weakness for pumpkin.

102
00:06:32,135 --> 00:06:33,917
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is the time of year, let me tell you.

103
00:06:34,917 --> 00:06:35,658
[SPEAKER_06]: You're shaking your head.

104
00:06:35,678 --> 00:06:35,938
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

105
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:36,899
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't like the pumpkin stuff.

106
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:38,720
[SPEAKER_06]: Went to Trader Joe's the other day.

107
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:46,405
[SPEAKER_06]: Alan and I loaded up on all this pumpkin stuff, like pumpkin butter, pumpkin bread mix, pumpkin macaroons.

108
00:06:47,006 --> 00:06:47,526
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw those.

109
00:06:47,886 --> 00:06:48,147
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

110
00:06:48,567 --> 00:06:48,787
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

111
00:06:48,867 --> 00:06:49,067
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.

112
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:49,608
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to try one?

113
00:06:50,348 --> 00:06:51,330
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to read the label.

114
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:52,432
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh wait, yeah, you're on a diet.

115
00:06:52,472 --> 00:06:53,313
[SPEAKER_06]: Never mind.

116
00:06:53,353 --> 00:06:53,954
[SPEAKER_03]: I should be encouraging.

117
00:06:53,974 --> 00:06:55,878
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me read the label to see if it's good.

118
00:06:56,158 --> 00:06:57,120
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

119
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:57,741
[SPEAKER_06]: Go check the freezer.

120
00:06:59,164 --> 00:07:01,705
[SPEAKER_07]: Reginator says Burger King is better than McDonald's.

121
00:07:01,845 --> 00:07:03,785
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I 100% agree.

122
00:07:04,105 --> 00:07:07,786
[SPEAKER_07]: Unfortunately, there is like four McDonald's on the way here and one Burger King.

123
00:07:08,206 --> 00:07:11,147
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just don't feel like stopping off the freeway to stop at the Burger King.

124
00:07:11,467 --> 00:07:17,768
[SPEAKER_07]: If the McDonald's by me was a Burger King, I'd be stopping at Burger King because I like Burger King way better than McDonald's.

125
00:07:17,828 --> 00:07:23,609
[SPEAKER_03]: Just FYI, I'd be able to have one if I wasn't so close already to my limit.

126
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:26,510
[SPEAKER_06]: Next week, if they're not gone.

127
00:07:27,119 --> 00:07:28,840
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to stay honest with myself.

128
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:29,381
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

129
00:07:29,641 --> 00:07:30,121
[SPEAKER_06]: You can do it.

130
00:07:30,782 --> 00:07:31,102
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

131
00:07:33,223 --> 00:07:33,543
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

132
00:07:33,884 --> 00:07:35,265
[SPEAKER_06]: I had a kickoff topic for tonight.

133
00:07:35,305 --> 00:07:41,048
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know how successful this will be, but I was thinking, you know, we're getting into the Halloween season like full swing now.

134
00:07:41,629 --> 00:07:43,390
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't know about you guys.

135
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:46,512
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not seeing as many like costume stores this year.

136
00:07:46,612 --> 00:07:48,493
[SPEAKER_06]: Like last year, it seemed like there was one on every corner.

137
00:07:48,934 --> 00:07:50,495
[SPEAKER_06]: This year, I'm not seeing as many.

138
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:51,415
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm not seeing as many.

139
00:07:51,836 --> 00:07:53,937
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe it's just the normal locations I see them at.

140
00:07:53,957 --> 00:07:55,038
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

141
00:07:55,538 --> 00:07:56,778
[SPEAKER_06]: I've seen quite a few.

142
00:07:56,859 --> 00:07:57,119
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you?

143
00:07:57,559 --> 00:08:02,521
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I thought I would ask what good video game costumes you might be seeing out there.

144
00:08:02,581 --> 00:08:05,001
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, are you seeing anything gaming inspired?

145
00:08:05,462 --> 00:08:08,743
[SPEAKER_06]: And what types of great gaming costumes have you seen in the past?

146
00:08:09,623 --> 00:08:16,986
[SPEAKER_06]: But this is a tricky subject because my mind always goes to these great gaming cosplays I've seen before, which technically is a little different than Halloween.

147
00:08:17,828 --> 00:08:21,113
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's just Halloween is the day that cosplay is like.

148
00:08:21,153 --> 00:08:23,035
[SPEAKER_06]: Cosplay is Halloween for grown-ups every day.

149
00:08:25,058 --> 00:08:26,299
[SPEAKER_06]: Or every other weekend, really.

150
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,885
[SPEAKER_07]: See, the difference between cosplay and Halloween is Halloween you get candy.

151
00:08:31,907 --> 00:08:33,990
[SPEAKER_07]: Cosplay you get sexually assaulted.

152
00:08:35,471 --> 00:08:38,072
[SPEAKER_06]: I shouldn't laugh at that, but sadly, it's true.

153
00:08:38,772 --> 00:08:39,432
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

154
00:08:40,032 --> 00:08:42,953
[SPEAKER_06]: So what kind of good costumes have you guys been seeing?

155
00:08:42,973 --> 00:08:49,855
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I find it interesting how Mario and Luigi have really kind of gone into the mainstream.

156
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:51,495
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I mean, it really shouldn't be a surprise.

157
00:08:51,535 --> 00:08:53,096
[SPEAKER_06]: Those games are obviously like landmark games.

158
00:08:53,136 --> 00:08:56,597
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's just funny how common that costume is now these days.

159
00:08:56,697 --> 00:09:00,878
[SPEAKER_06]: When I remember growing up, if you were to dress up like Mario, nobody knew who you were.

160
00:09:01,218 --> 00:09:02,838
[SPEAKER_06]: Actdeft in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com

161
00:09:22,084 --> 00:09:22,564
[SPEAKER_03]: Good times.

162
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:23,866
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I realize I still have?

163
00:09:24,467 --> 00:09:26,189
[SPEAKER_03]: My Organization 13 coat.

164
00:09:26,549 --> 00:09:26,809
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

165
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:29,352
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I don't know.

166
00:09:30,834 --> 00:09:33,657
[SPEAKER_03]: It was me and Kristen and Megzi.

167
00:09:34,578 --> 00:09:39,564
[SPEAKER_03]: We all went as our OCs, our Organization 13 OCs, which was pretty fun.

168
00:09:40,399 --> 00:10:01,697
[SPEAKER_06]: I do remember at Disneyland seeing a child dressed up as Sora And I was like, you have the coolest parents ever Because you don't see any Kingdom Hearts related stuff at Disneyland anymore Which is really sad Except for the pins I guess now, I think there's one or two now But yeah, probably just because you're starting to see more and more Kingdom Hearts With the game releases and leading up to 3 and so forth

169
00:10:02,589 --> 00:10:07,695
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that there's the Organization XIII Mickey, and then there's one other that I haven't been able to find.

170
00:10:08,657 --> 00:10:11,941
[SPEAKER_06]: I've seen the Organization XIII Mickey, but it'd be interesting.

171
00:10:12,602 --> 00:10:14,564
[SPEAKER_07]: It's never going to happen, Regenerator.

172
00:10:14,725 --> 00:10:15,606
[SPEAKER_06]: What's Regenerator saying?

173
00:10:15,706 --> 00:10:16,827
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki's tingle costume?

174
00:10:16,968 --> 00:10:18,550
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I think that's a lost cause.

175
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:19,271
[SPEAKER_06]: We gave up on that.

176
00:10:19,891 --> 00:10:23,092
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't get me wrong, I have the build for that, but it's just not going to happen.

177
00:10:24,193 --> 00:10:29,255
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to buy that much spandex.

178
00:10:29,315 --> 00:10:30,916
[SPEAKER_06]: What's your kid going as this year?

179
00:10:31,236 --> 00:10:32,596
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you doing anything gaming?

180
00:10:32,616 --> 00:10:33,397
[SPEAKER_06]: He's a firework.

181
00:10:33,757 --> 00:10:35,818
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh wait, that's right, you mentioned that on a previous episode.

182
00:10:36,258 --> 00:10:38,499
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, my sister is building the costume for that.

183
00:10:39,179 --> 00:10:47,903
[SPEAKER_07]: Although, I'm wondering though if they're not going to know what he is, because the costume kind of looks like a black t-shirt with garland wrapped around it.

184
00:10:48,423 --> 00:10:49,944
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

185
00:11:07,859 --> 00:11:09,300
[SPEAKER_02]: Like those things you get at the dollar store.

186
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,481
[SPEAKER_02]: Stuff you would think that you would see.

187
00:11:10,501 --> 00:11:12,042
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I've seen like wrapped in gifts and stuff.

188
00:11:12,183 --> 00:11:15,045
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, stuff you would kind of picture at like 4th of July.

189
00:11:15,165 --> 00:11:17,066
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, he's going to have that.

190
00:11:17,227 --> 00:11:18,087
[SPEAKER_07]: Because that's what he wanted to be.

191
00:11:18,107 --> 00:11:21,690
[SPEAKER_02]: He wanted to be, you know... He should have Stars and Stripes forever playing wherever he walks.

192
00:11:22,591 --> 00:11:24,793
[SPEAKER_07]: But, uh... So, yeah, that's what he's going to do.

193
00:11:25,033 --> 00:11:27,074
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not doing a costume this year just because...

194
00:11:28,456 --> 00:11:29,357
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't feel it

195
00:11:43,575 --> 00:11:43,996
[SPEAKER_06]: It's weird.

196
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:49,799
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the first Halloween I've had in a while where I don't have something with Rocky Horror Picture Show going on because that all finished up weeks early this year.

197
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:51,360
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't really have anything this year.

198
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:58,343
[SPEAKER_06]: So I did get invited to a party that's right after Halloween that's still a dress-up party.

199
00:11:58,464 --> 00:12:04,267
[SPEAKER_06]: It's something that Captain Spike is doing, which is the theme is around internet memes.

200
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:04,667
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

201
00:12:04,887 --> 00:12:05,647
[SPEAKER_07]: That sounds awesome.

202
00:12:05,707 --> 00:12:10,728
[SPEAKER_06]: So I know what I'm doing, but I'm not going to say because I know Captain Spike listens to this occasionally.

203
00:12:10,828 --> 00:12:12,869
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't want to spoil it because it's got to be a surprise.

204
00:12:13,289 --> 00:12:16,430
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'll tell you guys off air because I think you guys will get a kick out of it.

205
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:18,750
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

206
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:20,750
[SPEAKER_06]: Go into our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com.

207
00:12:21,051 --> 00:12:23,231
[SPEAKER_06]: Bobby Blackwolf says, a VOG starter.

208
00:12:23,751 --> 00:12:25,131
[SPEAKER_06]: Buy the spandex for Loki.

209
00:12:25,832 --> 00:12:27,592
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not – it's –

210
00:12:28,412 --> 00:12:30,734
[SPEAKER_06]: You're never going to let it die.

211
00:12:30,774 --> 00:12:33,016
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't buy spandex for Loki.

212
00:12:33,516 --> 00:12:34,037
[SPEAKER_03]: No offense.

213
00:12:35,418 --> 00:12:36,839
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the world would be a better place.

214
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,121
[SPEAKER_07]: But then we can get the glamour shots and everything.

215
00:12:40,141 --> 00:12:41,943
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, come on.

216
00:12:43,184 --> 00:12:43,504
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

217
00:12:43,544 --> 00:12:48,648
[SPEAKER_06]: Code Man in our chatroom says, trying to convince my wife to let me dress our daughter up as a white mage.

218
00:12:48,748 --> 00:12:51,350
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I saw the pictures of the concept stuff on Facebook.

219
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:52,251
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be pretty awesome.

220
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:52,731
[SPEAKER_06]: That is cute.

221
00:12:52,751 --> 00:12:53,331
[SPEAKER_06]: That's adorable.

222
00:12:53,832 --> 00:12:55,553
[SPEAKER_06]: So a little baby white mage.

223
00:12:55,573 --> 00:12:57,074
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, not baby, but toddler white mage.

224
00:12:57,214 --> 00:12:57,755
[SPEAKER_06]: It's pretty cute.

225
00:12:58,355 --> 00:13:16,757
[SPEAKER_06]: now I'm sure this is something that they have like a white mage hoodie like that has like the you know I'm sure it's not horrifically difficult to make you have like just like a white plain hoodie thing and then you kind of put the fringe on it like I mean I don't know how well uh convincing it would look but something like that so

226
00:13:18,076 --> 00:13:31,219
[SPEAKER_03]: It really actually wouldn't be that hard because to do one of the concepts of a white mage, your basic robe would be a pretty big circle skirt with sleeves sewn on and then just a hoodie top.

227
00:13:31,339 --> 00:13:32,840
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean it really would be that easy.

228
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:38,541
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a pattern for one that I was going to do as a cosplay eventually, but never did.

229
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:42,885
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it doesn't seem like, it depends what kind of white mage you're going for.

230
00:13:43,485 --> 00:13:44,406
[SPEAKER_06]: It wouldn't be too difficult.

231
00:13:44,426 --> 00:13:48,631
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're trying to go as Yuna, that might be a little trickier, because you've got to get the right colors and all that.

232
00:13:48,691 --> 00:13:51,474
[SPEAKER_03]: And you also have to be, you know, anorexic.

233
00:13:52,815 --> 00:13:54,196
[SPEAKER_06]: She's also not a white mage, I mean.

234
00:13:54,737 --> 00:13:55,638
[SPEAKER_06]: She's a summoner.

235
00:13:55,658 --> 00:13:57,860
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, she's a summoner slash white mage.

236
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,723
[SPEAKER_03]: If you were going to be a white mage, then you would have to be What's-Her-Face from 9.

237
00:14:02,526 --> 00:14:04,048
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.com

238
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:17,461
[SPEAKER_03]: I played more Fractal.

239
00:14:18,081 --> 00:14:20,602
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just my chill-out kind of game, so I love it.

240
00:14:20,922 --> 00:14:22,523
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm playing more Bejeweled.

241
00:14:23,123 --> 00:14:30,005
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually broke a million points twice on one of the modes, which is actually kind of difficult.

242
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:36,828
[SPEAKER_03]: I played Final Fantasy XIV, which I am at the Bukake Manor.

243
00:14:38,445 --> 00:14:39,325
[SPEAKER_03]: or was it Hauke?

244
00:14:39,425 --> 00:14:40,266
[SPEAKER_06]: Hawk Manor, yeah.

245
00:14:40,326 --> 00:14:40,606
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

246
00:14:41,706 --> 00:14:45,007
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I need help doing that one eventually.

247
00:14:45,967 --> 00:14:48,448
[SPEAKER_03]: And what else did I play?

248
00:14:49,068 --> 00:14:55,209
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually played Mass Effect 2 because Becky has this thing for me using the high-res mod.

249
00:14:55,529 --> 00:15:03,652
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, not really doing the high-res mod but I do the high-res mod anyway to take screen caps for her of her shepherd so that she can have pretty pictures.

250
00:15:04,172 --> 00:15:04,892
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's what I did.

251
00:15:05,752 --> 00:15:21,082
[SPEAKER_03]: and then I'm actually playing through I'm trying to finish my game on three just because I should finish it but that and I need more screencap fodder because I'm really really really really running out of ideas for my stupid caption bullshit

252
00:15:23,781 --> 00:15:25,843
[SPEAKER_03]: and, yes, Bitchface Aerith.

253
00:15:27,684 --> 00:15:29,505
[SPEAKER_03]: And I do not name Aerith Bitchface.

254
00:15:29,545 --> 00:15:33,107
[SPEAKER_03]: I name her Aerith with a T-H, but she's still Bitchface in my esteem.

255
00:15:35,049 --> 00:15:37,210
[SPEAKER_03]: I played something... Animal Crossing.

256
00:15:38,171 --> 00:15:41,473
[SPEAKER_03]: And I feel bad because I was going to open my village tonight and I left it at home.

257
00:15:41,993 --> 00:15:42,173
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

258
00:15:43,294 --> 00:15:45,216
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, I have three characters in my village now.

259
00:15:45,336 --> 00:15:52,822
[SPEAKER_03]: I have Sakura, I have Tsubasa, who I made just for the sole purpose of redecoration and making Ed move, because Ed's fucking creepy.

260
00:15:52,842 --> 00:15:54,524
[SPEAKER_03]: Did it work?

261
00:15:54,824 --> 00:15:57,606
[SPEAKER_03]: No, he's still fucking there, the shit.

262
00:15:58,427 --> 00:16:01,870
[SPEAKER_03]: And I made a character for Julian, for Becky's son.

263
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:02,530
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, nice.

264
00:16:02,691 --> 00:16:05,153
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I don't know if I... I may have mentioned this before.

265
00:16:05,273 --> 00:16:10,459
[SPEAKER_03]: He sits with me when I play the game over there, and he practices his reading with Animal Crossing.

266
00:16:10,479 --> 00:16:16,104
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have to, you know, skip past kitty fuck and, you know, poot.

267
00:16:16,204 --> 00:16:17,005
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, poot's okay.

268
00:16:17,406 --> 00:16:20,249
[SPEAKER_03]: But I have to skip past the one that says pussy.

269
00:16:20,909 --> 00:16:21,710
[SPEAKER_03]: The naughty language.

270
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:22,851
[SPEAKER_03]: Kitty fuck and all that.

271
00:16:23,772 --> 00:16:23,952
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

272
00:16:26,923 --> 00:16:27,344
[SPEAKER_03]: and DarkSakura.com

273
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:50,563
[SPEAKER_03]: Dan busted out the NES and played Kickle Cubicle.

274
00:16:50,803 --> 00:16:54,324
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just the way you say Kickle that makes it sort of come out the other way.

275
00:16:54,564 --> 00:16:55,305
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember that game.

276
00:16:55,625 --> 00:17:02,428
[SPEAKER_03]: So now that we have the NES hooked up, I'm actually going to be playing... I'm thinking about trying to rebuild my skills on Guardian Legend.

277
00:17:03,989 --> 00:17:04,689
[SPEAKER_06]: Nothing wrong with that.

278
00:17:04,849 --> 00:17:10,232
[SPEAKER_03]: I am going to be in tears for the next month until I remember how to play that damn game because that game's fucking hard.

279
00:17:10,877 --> 00:17:11,698
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

280
00:17:26,052 --> 00:17:26,932
[SPEAKER_07]: GameNights.

281
00:17:27,012 --> 00:17:28,593
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I was hearing some good stuff about that on Twitter.

282
00:17:28,613 --> 00:17:29,033
[SPEAKER_06]: How'd that go?

283
00:17:29,653 --> 00:17:48,020
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, the first night when I was doing PS3, I was trying to do video capture, and I have the Elgato capture thing, but for some damn reason, it would not pick up the PlayStation 3, even through the component cables, which is weird, though, because I thought I had another set of component cables, so maybe I'm just doing it wrong or something.

284
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,161
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought I had one that was...

285
00:17:49,861 --> 00:18:03,691
[SPEAKER_07]: The PlayStation, actually, the multi-AV input thing, it was just that to the Elgato, and I can't find that, so I used the component thing, and that did not work out at all.

286
00:18:03,771 --> 00:18:05,613
[SPEAKER_07]: It just could not detect it for some reason.

287
00:18:06,413 --> 00:18:11,597
[SPEAKER_07]: But it was being finicky, even with my Xbox 360 is doing the same kind of bullshit.

288
00:18:11,797 --> 00:18:14,739
[SPEAKER_07]: So, kind of skipped capturing that stuff.

289
00:18:14,859 --> 00:18:17,762
[SPEAKER_07]: It's okay, though, because we only had about two people, I think, the first night.

290
00:18:18,402 --> 00:18:25,924
[SPEAKER_07]: Then on Friday, we did the second game night, which was on the Xbox 360 version of Grand Theft Auto Online.

291
00:18:25,944 --> 00:18:26,684
[SPEAKER_07]: That was a great turnout.

292
00:18:26,724 --> 00:18:30,025
[SPEAKER_07]: We had about four or five people, including Bobby.

293
00:18:30,565 --> 00:18:38,787
[SPEAKER_07]: And we basically... Bobby didn't want to do any death matches, so we just did races and parachute drops.

294
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:42,828
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the one I think I had the most fun with was Top Fun.

295
00:18:43,628 --> 00:18:46,271
[SPEAKER_07]: Top Fun is a team game.

296
00:18:46,812 --> 00:18:50,916
[SPEAKER_07]: One team is in jets and the other team is in cars.

297
00:18:52,197 --> 00:18:53,438
[SPEAKER_07]: Cars are motorcycles usually.

298
00:18:54,259 --> 00:18:59,984
[SPEAKER_07]: They have to get from one point to another point on the map without getting killed by the people in the jets.

299
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:02,727
[SPEAKER_07]: It was some pretty intense gameplay.

300
00:19:02,747 --> 00:19:08,012
[SPEAKER_07]: There was one where we had some other people join in with us, and we had all died.

301
00:19:08,472 --> 00:19:16,720
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we were just watching this guy just haul ass through the entire Los Santos area and stuff.

302
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:20,123
[SPEAKER_07]: And there was this one where he hit a jump somehow and dodged two missiles.

303
00:19:20,363 --> 00:19:22,485
[SPEAKER_07]: And thankfully, I had the foresight to...

304
00:19:23,106 --> 00:19:23,986
[SPEAKER_07]: Capture everything.

305
00:19:24,046 --> 00:19:26,927
[SPEAKER_07]: So I have that all recorded and I'll be cutting a highlight reel.

306
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:32,169
[SPEAKER_07]: The only thing that kind of sucks is I didn't manage to record my voice when I'm talking over voice chat.

307
00:19:32,189 --> 00:19:34,429
[SPEAKER_07]: So you hear a lot of one-sided conversations.

308
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:37,530
[SPEAKER_07]: But next time we'll be prepared for that.

309
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:39,711
[SPEAKER_07]: But still, four hours of stuff I've got to cut through.

310
00:19:39,771 --> 00:19:41,171
[SPEAKER_06]: So are you going to do it again next week?

311
00:19:41,211 --> 00:19:42,831
[SPEAKER_06]: Or is this like a one-to-one thing or what?

312
00:19:43,012 --> 00:19:46,793
[SPEAKER_07]: It may not be next week, but maybe in a couple weeks we'll do it again.

313
00:19:48,433 --> 00:19:57,437
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, I had a lot of fun, and we just, you know, we actually, I think we leveled up about five levels just playing that, you know, and it was great, so.

314
00:19:57,597 --> 00:19:57,777
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.

315
00:19:58,157 --> 00:20:06,401
[SPEAKER_07]: It's hard, though, because I know people on the, you know, the East Coast and stuff, it's like really late, and Bobby goes up until like three in the morning, because we played until almost midnight, so.

316
00:20:06,461 --> 00:20:07,361
[SPEAKER_06]: He's always up that late, though.

317
00:20:07,681 --> 00:20:11,503
[SPEAKER_07]: He runs on West Coast time, even though he's over there in Atlanta.

318
00:20:12,203 --> 00:20:21,451
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, but yeah, so I'm gonna try to do it again, cause I'm really limited in my window of time, um, to actually play, cause, you know, I have to wait for my son to go to sleep, so.

319
00:20:21,471 --> 00:20:23,672
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, but yeah, I'll definitely do it again.

320
00:20:24,213 --> 00:20:24,273
[SPEAKER_07]: Um.

321
00:20:26,349 --> 00:20:27,550
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, it was a lot of fun.

322
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:39,396
[SPEAKER_07]: And then aside from playing Grand Theft Auto Online those couple times, I also did play some of the single player and now I'm almost 86% done with my 100% storyline stuff.

323
00:20:39,436 --> 00:20:47,380
[SPEAKER_07]: I did the rest of the missions I had left and I did all of the, well, some more of the, what was it, the...

324
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:57,085
[SPEAKER_07]: Offroad Races, Assassination Missions, and then some of the Tonya towing missions.

325
00:20:57,165 --> 00:21:03,749
[SPEAKER_07]: But the last one she has isn't triggered yet, so that's the only thing I'm waiting on to get all my Strangers and Freaks stuff done.

326
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:32,895
[SPEAKER_07]: but yeah it's been a lot of fun and I'm trying to get the 100% so I can start doing that like Chiliad mystery stuff and I'll definitely be playing more online especially more on 360 because my co-workers flaked on me I had one of my co-workers up here on the Thursday night game so we played but I was the only one that had a headset that day so that was kind of difficult to get people together and he didn't really know how to join games so it was kind of

327
00:21:34,035 --> 00:21:34,556
[SPEAKER_07]: and DarkSakura.

328
00:21:57,596 --> 00:22:02,498
[SPEAKER_07]: I can see how they constantly re-invite people back into your game just to keep everyone in the same world.

329
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:06,400
[SPEAKER_07]: We had a lot of fun, so definitely looking forward to doing that again soon.

330
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:07,721
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

331
00:22:08,541 --> 00:22:11,983
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, be sure to let us all know when the next game night is for Grand Theft Auto.

332
00:22:12,183 --> 00:22:14,844
[SPEAKER_06]: And in the meantime, you can join the VOG crew, right?

333
00:22:14,984 --> 00:22:16,905
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we've got like 46 people in there.

334
00:22:16,945 --> 00:22:17,605
[SPEAKER_06]: Holy moly.

335
00:22:17,865 --> 00:22:18,125
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.

336
00:22:18,846 --> 00:22:19,166
[SPEAKER_06]: Very cool.

337
00:22:20,346 --> 00:22:21,047
[SPEAKER_06]: My gaming week.

338
00:22:21,707 --> 00:22:25,930
[SPEAKER_06]: Didn't play as much video games as I would have liked to this week, but I did play a little bit.

339
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:28,091
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been playing some Final Fantasy XIV.

340
00:22:29,212 --> 00:22:30,713
[SPEAKER_06]: My White Mage is an endgame.

341
00:22:30,993 --> 00:22:36,216
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know how many of you are playing Final Fantasy XIV out there or are an endgame, but if you are an endgame, then you'll understand what I say.

342
00:22:36,957 --> 00:22:41,700
[SPEAKER_06]: I got my Ifrit weapon from the Primal Fight, and then two days later got my Garuda one.

343
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:46,143
[SPEAKER_06]: After so many tries on the Ifrit one, like two days later I get the better one from Garuda, but whatever.

344
00:22:46,443 --> 00:22:46,923
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkLightGear.com

345
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,462
[SPEAKER_06]: and, let's see, what else did I play this week?

346
00:23:17,662 --> 00:23:29,709
[SPEAKER_06]: I went back and visited Pac-Man Championship Edition, because I don't know if you guys know, but they just came out with the Pac-Man Championship Edition Plus, like the Plus add-on, which is, it's pretty much just a free patch for Pac-Man Championship Edition.

347
00:23:30,069 --> 00:23:54,026
[SPEAKER_06]: but now they have a little bit of a store kind of built in there so you can buy some additional skins you can buy a couple additional mazes and a couple additional songs not a lot of stuff but uh you know just it's fun to go back and and kind of have a reason to play that again and I like what they did with like the Dig Dug skin and the uh Rally-X skin it doesn't change the game it just makes it look like you're playing Rally-X but it's like Pac-Man style so that's kind of

348
00:23:54,246 --> 00:23:56,268
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, I kind of like that that was something a little different there.

349
00:23:56,589 --> 00:23:57,990
[SPEAKER_06]: And some of the new songs are cool too.

350
00:23:58,030 --> 00:24:01,274
[SPEAKER_06]: They also have the original Championship Edition 1 song in there.

351
00:24:01,314 --> 00:24:04,037
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's kind of neat that you can go back and play that if you want.

352
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:08,983
[SPEAKER_06]: The other new game that I've been playing this week...

353
00:24:09,804 --> 00:24:10,165
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, thank you.

354
00:24:10,225 --> 00:24:11,486
[SPEAKER_06]: Actdeft is correcting me in our chatroom.

355
00:24:11,526 --> 00:24:12,547
[SPEAKER_06]: Live.vognetwork.com.

356
00:24:12,607 --> 00:24:14,710
[SPEAKER_06]: It's DX+, not Championship Edition.

357
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:16,312
[SPEAKER_06]: Championship Edition was the first.

358
00:24:16,692 --> 00:24:17,693
[SPEAKER_06]: DX was the second.

359
00:24:17,793 --> 00:24:18,774
[SPEAKER_06]: Now there's DX+.

360
00:24:19,896 --> 00:24:23,219
[SPEAKER_06]: Excuse me if I'm getting confused with all these frickin' Pac-Man games.

361
00:24:24,141 --> 00:24:25,382
[SPEAKER_06]: Then we had Pac-Man and Ms.

362
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:29,046
[SPEAKER_06]: Pac-Man and Junior Pac-Man and Baby Pac-Man and, yeah, Pac-Mania.

363
00:24:29,186 --> 00:24:29,407
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway.

364
00:24:31,789 --> 00:24:33,651
[SPEAKER_06]: So, new game I played this week.

365
00:24:34,612 --> 00:24:40,617
[SPEAKER_06]: Last week I told the hilarious story about how I loaned my 3DS out to Princess Irene who then went to Japan.

366
00:24:40,897 --> 00:24:48,224
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, she came back from Japan, so today I was finally able to play Pokemon Y. So I haven't been able to play a lot of it, but I will say...

367
00:24:49,985 --> 00:24:59,388
[SPEAKER_06]: It's about time we finally get a next-gen Pokemon game, because this is the first time I've played a Pokemon game in a while where I'm like, oh wow, this looks really good.

368
00:24:59,668 --> 00:25:10,171
[SPEAKER_06]: This looks like it's running on the current hardware, because let's face it, Black 2 and White 2 and Black and White were not up to par with where the DS was at at that point.

369
00:25:10,211 --> 00:25:18,653
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's probably the decision to make those games DS and not 3DS probably plays into that a little bit.

370
00:25:19,053 --> 00:25:19,894
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

371
00:25:37,248 --> 00:25:50,173
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and I'm loving that within just a few minutes of being in the game and kind of going into the first area, there's already a diverse amount of Pokemon in the very first area.

372
00:25:50,713 --> 00:25:54,655
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, you're not just going to get a bunch of Bidoofs and Pidgeys in the first area.

373
00:25:55,015 --> 00:26:01,357
[SPEAKER_06]: There's actually like seven different Pokemon, like enough where you're already sending Pokemon to the box within the first little zone.

374
00:26:01,757 --> 00:26:03,358
[SPEAKER_06]: Is the box like putting them to sleep?

375
00:26:03,778 --> 00:26:06,439
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's putting them in the computer is what it is.

376
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,781
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's a Pikachu in the very first zone.

377
00:26:10,241 --> 00:26:13,542
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, that's the type of Pokemon that people really want.

378
00:26:13,842 --> 00:26:21,526
[SPEAKER_06]: People don't go into a Pokemon game going, I really want a Pidgey, or I really want a Zigzag Zoon, or I don't know, maybe you do, but most people don't.

379
00:26:21,906 --> 00:26:24,407
[SPEAKER_06]: Most people want Pikachu.

380
00:26:24,727 --> 00:26:26,288
[SPEAKER_06]: They want the cute stuff, you know?

381
00:26:26,428 --> 00:26:28,369
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, hell no, I want that dark dog-looking one.

382
00:26:28,389 --> 00:26:30,149
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's awesome.

383
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:30,930
[SPEAKER_06]: So...

384
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:35,794
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, I like that there was already that diversity and so forth.

385
00:26:35,814 --> 00:26:37,756
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, the combat looks great.

386
00:26:38,657 --> 00:26:43,502
[SPEAKER_06]: The only downer is if you're playing combat in 3D mode, very noticeable dip in quality.

387
00:26:43,902 --> 00:26:49,127
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm sure you've heard this a lot of places, but I'm telling you too, very noticeable dip in quality.

388
00:26:49,468 --> 00:26:51,550
[SPEAKER_06]: It's almost as if this game was made for the 2DS.

389
00:26:52,851 --> 00:27:22,042
[SPEAKER_06]: honestly and I kind of think it was in some regards and I think most people will be playing it with the 3D off because like when you're walking around the map and everything it doesn't even really doesn't really use the 3D it only uses the 3D in the battles and maybe here and there like in the opening and things like that that's really it but I mean that doesn't really affect the game at the end of the day but it is a very interesting sign for maybe this 3DS or 3D thing is is gonna be gone a little sooner than we think they tricked you into buying another Game Boy didn't they

390
00:27:23,047 --> 00:27:26,048
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I did not buy... I waited for Irene to bring my other 3DS back.

391
00:27:26,148 --> 00:27:33,991
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm just saying that the whole thing... Remember, the thing that Nintendo is really good about is getting people to buy the Game Boy over and over and over again.

392
00:27:34,352 --> 00:27:40,634
[SPEAKER_07]: They'll have the Game Boy, the Game Boy Color, the Game Boy Pocket, the Game Boy Advance, SP, and so on and so forth, different colors.

393
00:27:41,174 --> 00:27:47,377
[SPEAKER_07]: The DS, the DSi, the DSi XL, the 3DS, which is basically a DS anyways...

394
00:27:48,077 --> 00:27:51,539
[SPEAKER_07]: And now they're like, oh, hey, we don't really need the 3D anymore.

395
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:53,641
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's basically a fancy DS.

396
00:27:53,901 --> 00:27:58,764
[SPEAKER_07]: Ah, they got you to buy another DS, which in turn is basically Game Boy Advance, which is a Game Boy.

397
00:27:59,144 --> 00:27:59,784
[SPEAKER_06]: I will say this.

398
00:27:59,904 --> 00:28:03,046
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not coming up in tonight's news because we had other stuff to talk about.

399
00:28:03,106 --> 00:28:08,970
[SPEAKER_06]: But there is that 3DS XL with the Legend of Zelda, the two Triforces in the top and bottom.

400
00:28:09,010 --> 00:28:10,511
[SPEAKER_06]: That 3DS XL is coming out.

401
00:28:11,851 --> 00:28:14,413
[SPEAKER_06]: It was in the leaked GameStop Black Friday ad.

402
00:28:14,933 --> 00:28:43,412
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm really hoping it is not a GameStop exclusive I don't know at this point Please don't, please don't be an exclusive Because I really want one But I won't buy it If it's a GameStop exclusive, I won't buy it But I probably will buy that Just because I'm a consumer whore Or more like I haven't been this excited for a Zelda game in a very long time Like the fact that they're making a sequel to Link to the Past I'm like, yes please, admit one please So I definitely look forward to that

403
00:28:43,723 --> 00:29:13,193
[SPEAKER_06]: however this whole fact that some of the games are really just saying ah fuck 3D that are coming from Nintendo well I guess technically Pokemon is not a first party Nintendo game but it's like a second party it's like it's first party they own the company that makes it but Pokemon company is in a really weird place because don't forget Pokemon company makes iPhone apps too which is something Nintendo refuses to do oh no I guess they're going to make Miiverse though I guess maybe that is changing their it's first party but well whatever it is it's still you know

404
00:29:14,847 --> 00:29:16,188
[SPEAKER_06]: It's still interesting.

405
00:29:16,568 --> 00:29:23,573
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, I'm very curious to see what's going to happen next with the DS, and I'm kind of wondering if we're going to see a new DS.

406
00:29:23,613 --> 00:29:31,318
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if we would see a new full DS next year, but I just feel like it wouldn't be Nintendo if we didn't get some sort of handheld next year.

407
00:29:31,338 --> 00:29:31,958
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?

408
00:29:31,978 --> 00:29:33,900
[SPEAKER_06]: We got the 2DS this year, which, you know, whatever.

409
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:35,841
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm really curious what happens next year.

410
00:29:36,281 --> 00:29:42,766
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it going to be the 2DS and the clamshell that everybody wants, or is it going to be like 3DS XL Uber or something, you know?

411
00:29:42,926 --> 00:29:43,906
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm so curious.

412
00:29:43,926 --> 00:29:44,327
[SPEAKER_06]: Tablet.

413
00:29:45,528 --> 00:29:46,648
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

414
00:30:04,541 --> 00:30:12,586
[SPEAKER_07]: Or, I don't know, they'll allow you to run 3DS games on your Wii U. Because that's going to happen, eventually.

415
00:30:13,067 --> 00:30:15,648
[SPEAKER_07]: I will say it again and again, it's going to happen.

416
00:30:15,829 --> 00:30:17,990
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe every single week, but eventually it'll happen.

417
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:19,311
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll be like, see, I told you so!

418
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:23,273
[SPEAKER_06]: Or it won't ever happen, and you'll just forget you ever said anything.

419
00:30:24,634 --> 00:30:26,656
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, so yeah, Pokemon Y, I'm enjoying it.

420
00:30:26,796 --> 00:30:29,718
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to play a little more, way more into it than I was...

421
00:30:30,518 --> 00:30:34,084
[SPEAKER_06]: Black or Black 2 or any of the previous Pokemon games I have been playing.

422
00:30:34,104 --> 00:30:35,146
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'll let you know how that goes.

423
00:30:35,586 --> 00:30:41,977
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll let you know if I actually am able to stick with it to beat a few gym leaders or if I end up giving it up and going back to MMOs full time.

424
00:30:42,337 --> 00:30:42,718
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

425
00:30:43,584 --> 00:30:49,747
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, over at live.vognetwork.com Techness in our chatroom says, I remember playing Yellow.

426
00:30:50,207 --> 00:30:52,269
[SPEAKER_06]: It was pretty much, yay, I finally have a Pikachu.

427
00:30:52,449 --> 00:30:53,349
[SPEAKER_06]: Then it became crap.

428
00:30:53,389 --> 00:30:58,212
[SPEAKER_06]: He's useless when you hit the first gym and end up wasting time leveling up some mediocre grass type.

429
00:30:58,932 --> 00:31:09,557
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, kind of is the one bummer about Pokemon games sometimes is that you don't necessarily get to really play with that starter if, you know, the gym you want to fight is strong to that type.

430
00:31:09,577 --> 00:31:11,038
[SPEAKER_06]: But there's such a diversity.

431
00:31:11,058 --> 00:31:12,399
[SPEAKER_06]: You usually find something else you like.

432
00:31:12,919 --> 00:31:28,349
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I think it's, I started with Fennekin, obviously, but then when I got that Pikachu in the first zone, I was like, hell yeah, so now I have a Pikachu, and then I like to have a Pidgey, too, because they have the air attack and all that, although he'll probably get replaced later, but for now, you know, so, anyway.

433
00:31:31,071 --> 00:31:37,655
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see, going to the chatroom at live.vognetwork.com, Codeman suggests the Nintendo 4DS, you move with the game.

434
00:31:38,669 --> 00:31:40,150
[SPEAKER_03]: Sky, Loki, and Dark Sakura all getting the new systems.

435
00:32:08,772 --> 00:32:09,392
[SPEAKER_06]: Good question.

436
00:32:09,432 --> 00:32:10,493
[SPEAKER_06]: Are we getting the new systems?

437
00:32:11,673 --> 00:32:16,115
[SPEAKER_02]: We're likely getting a PS4, but I need a job.

438
00:32:17,615 --> 00:32:25,818
[SPEAKER_06]: I still have a PlayStation 4 on pre-order, although we're going to get into some news here very shortly that kind of makes me make a sad face when it comes to that.

439
00:32:25,878 --> 00:32:28,619
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I'll still get it, but yeah.

440
00:32:28,679 --> 00:32:28,940
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki?

441
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:29,780
[SPEAKER_07]: Not at launch.

442
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:30,920
[SPEAKER_06]: Not at launch.

443
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:31,441
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not getting it.

444
00:32:31,541 --> 00:32:32,981
[SPEAKER_07]: Launch, I canceled my pre-orders already.

445
00:32:33,801 --> 00:32:36,843
[SPEAKER_07]: Or pre-order, because I didn't pre-order the Xbox One.

446
00:32:36,923 --> 00:32:37,183
[SPEAKER_07]: Please.

447
00:32:38,652 --> 00:32:38,992
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

448
00:32:40,073 --> 00:32:50,137
[SPEAKER_06]: Going to our housekeeping segment, we just want to tease that we have our Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio, and our Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR.

449
00:32:50,177 --> 00:32:52,077
[SPEAKER_06]: So please be our friend on those sites.

450
00:32:52,778 --> 00:32:59,780
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, just letting you know, and this may be news to my co-hosts too, sorry about it, but there may not be a show November 10th.

451
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:04,362
[SPEAKER_06]: It's looking like I'm going to be out of town thanks to BlizzCon, even though I'm not going.

452
00:33:04,822 --> 00:33:05,623
[SPEAKER_06]: I am not going to BlizzCon.

453
00:33:05,643 --> 00:33:06,543
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to DisCon?

454
00:33:06,883 --> 00:33:09,304
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to DizCon and I'm going to the BlizzCon parties.

455
00:33:09,724 --> 00:33:09,984
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.

456
00:33:10,724 --> 00:33:14,565
[SPEAKER_06]: So, may not be a show November 10th unless I'm able to rush home and be here in time.

457
00:33:14,886 --> 00:33:15,206
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

458
00:33:16,586 --> 00:33:19,567
[SPEAKER_06]: Just letting you know in advance, but we still have a couple weeks of show before we get there.

459
00:33:20,007 --> 00:33:25,109
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, let's get into gaming news and Loki, some of the sad news for PlayStation 4.

460
00:33:25,829 --> 00:33:26,049
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

461
00:33:26,109 --> 00:33:27,010
[SPEAKER_06]: Awaiters this week, right?

462
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:30,733
[SPEAKER_07]: Sadly, it was bound to happen, but games are being delayed.

463
00:33:31,654 --> 00:33:32,935
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not too surprised by this.

464
00:33:33,115 --> 00:33:34,857
[SPEAKER_07]: Watch Dogs has been delayed to spring 2014.

465
00:33:35,958 --> 00:33:46,146
[SPEAKER_07]: And the reason why I'm not surprised by this is because Ubisoft has a ton of fucking titles coming out in the fourth quarter, including Assassin's Creed 4 and South Park among them.

466
00:33:46,567 --> 00:33:52,652
[SPEAKER_07]: So to have Watch Dogs coming out at the same time, I mean, Watch Dogs is almost kind of competing with Assassin's Creed 4.

467
00:33:53,092 --> 00:33:54,913
[SPEAKER_07]: So why would they want to compete with themselves?

468
00:33:54,973 --> 00:34:00,818
[SPEAKER_07]: Might as well just put out your game in a slower period of the year and polish it up even more.

469
00:34:01,018 --> 00:34:05,401
[SPEAKER_07]: Even though that does kind of suck for people that were hoping to buy that as a next-gen game.

470
00:34:05,881 --> 00:34:10,324
[SPEAKER_07]: I know when I was actually thinking about getting a PlayStation 4, that would have been one of the titles I would have probably picked up for it.

471
00:34:11,465 --> 00:34:14,366
[SPEAKER_07]: But, yeah, I guess we just got to wait.

472
00:34:14,746 --> 00:34:23,810
[SPEAKER_07]: Right now it's expected to be hitting the next financial year, which I believe they're estimating that to be second quarter of 2014.

473
00:34:24,971 --> 00:34:28,392
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, to go along with that, The Crew has been delayed to mid-2014.

474
00:34:29,013 --> 00:34:37,376
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, it's around the, I guess, summer period, so that runs July 2014 to September 2014.

475
00:34:39,917 --> 00:34:42,618
[SPEAKER_07]: and I'm not surprised.

476
00:34:42,678 --> 00:34:48,300
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I don't even think they really had a date for that other than I think it was supposed to be early 2014, so whatever.

477
00:34:48,320 --> 00:35:00,264
[SPEAKER_07]: The one that is kind of disappointing though, Sony, one of their first party launch titles has been delayed, Drive Club, which was supposed to be one of those games they actually got at least a somewhat...

478
00:35:01,601 --> 00:35:02,381
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

479
00:35:23,614 --> 00:35:33,646
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but this is more of, I think it's more of simulation racing, so Need for Speed is definitely arcade, so they might not, it's not necessarily like Forza 5 or something.

480
00:35:33,746 --> 00:35:33,946
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.

481
00:35:33,966 --> 00:35:36,509
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, they had Gran Turismo 6, but that's PlayStation 3.

482
00:35:36,549 --> 00:35:36,669
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

483
00:35:44,938 --> 00:35:50,380
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of these games that are coming out, there's not a whole ton of exclusives for these next-gen systems at launch.

484
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,962
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's still really good games coming out on current-gen.

485
00:35:54,002 --> 00:35:58,623
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, right now, Grand Theft Auto V is not on next-gen.

486
00:35:58,783 --> 00:36:00,904
[SPEAKER_07]: Gran Turismo 6 is not on next-gen.

487
00:36:00,924 --> 00:36:07,627
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, there's plenty of games out there that they don't have next-gen versions for.

488
00:36:07,787 --> 00:36:12,729
[SPEAKER_07]: And Call of Duty, let's be honest, it's probably not going to be that much better on PlayStation 4 or Xbox One.

489
00:36:13,569 --> 00:36:15,431
[SPEAKER_07]: Aside from graphics, it'll probably look nicer.

490
00:36:16,051 --> 00:36:29,942
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it's also interesting that big controversy a couple weeks ago when Sony delayed the PlayStation 4 in Japan to next year because they said, you know what, we're really not going to have games out available for it this holiday.

491
00:36:30,322 --> 00:36:34,605
[SPEAKER_06]: And now it's kind of looking like, yeah, maybe that is the case.

492
00:36:35,986 --> 00:36:39,589
[SPEAKER_06]: I was curious, what games are going to be out at launch?

493
00:36:40,229 --> 00:36:41,810
[SPEAKER_06]: What is going to be out on the PlayStation 4?

494
00:36:42,411 --> 00:36:43,892
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a partial list here on Wiki.

495
00:36:43,932 --> 00:36:45,293
[SPEAKER_06]: This is Wikipedia.

496
00:36:45,353 --> 00:36:46,974
[SPEAKER_06]: I have mine full list up in my head.

497
00:36:46,994 --> 00:36:47,635
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, go for it.

498
00:36:47,835 --> 00:36:52,098
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so as far as, and I can only really speak to North America because I have no idea.

499
00:36:52,119 --> 00:36:52,559
[SPEAKER_06]: No, that's fine.

500
00:36:52,579 --> 00:36:53,359
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I want to know.

501
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:56,942
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so first party titles are going to be coming out.

502
00:36:56,962 --> 00:36:59,544
[SPEAKER_07]: You have, of course, Killzone, Shadowfall.

503
00:36:59,965 --> 00:37:05,249
[SPEAKER_07]: You have Knack, and that's pretty much it, actually.

504
00:37:05,289 --> 00:37:06,310
[SPEAKER_07]: That is it.

505
00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:09,032
[SPEAKER_07]: Since Drive Club fell off, that's it.

506
00:37:09,832 --> 00:37:24,261
[SPEAKER_07]: Third party, you've got Call of Duty, Assassin's Creed 4, Battlefield 4, Need for Speed, NBA Live, NBA 2K14, there's also... What was the other ones here?

507
00:37:24,501 --> 00:37:27,763
[SPEAKER_07]: There was... This is something no one's going to really pick up.

508
00:37:27,823 --> 00:37:33,686
[SPEAKER_07]: Skylanders, Swap Force, LEGO Marvel Super Heroes, Angry Birds Star Wars...

509
00:37:35,677 --> 00:37:39,060
[SPEAKER_06]: The only ones I'm not hearing is Need for Speed Rivals.

510
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,881
[SPEAKER_06]: I said Need for Speed Rivals.

511
00:37:40,981 --> 00:37:41,441
[SPEAKER_06]: Just Dance 2014.

512
00:37:41,642 --> 00:37:43,543
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Just Dance 2014 is coming out.

513
00:37:43,703 --> 00:37:47,186
[SPEAKER_06]: And you said one of the NBA games, but there's two on the list.

514
00:37:47,206 --> 00:37:49,187
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I said both.

515
00:37:49,468 --> 00:38:03,799
[SPEAKER_06]: NBA Live, which is next-gen exclusive, and NBA 2K14, which is... Now, there are some network games, too, which I know you wouldn't be as up on, but there's things like Contrast, Divekick, Minecraft, and Pinball Arcade.

516
00:38:04,139 --> 00:38:25,039
[SPEAKER_07]: Rezogun is another one those are all things that are set to be available on PlayStation Network Injustice also oh yeah that's right the Injustice Ultimate Edition yeah that's right they're getting a PlayStation 4 version but that's that's that and Injustice to be honest Injustice at least the next gen version is exclusive to the PlayStation 4 so they do have that I guess um

517
00:38:26,139 --> 00:38:31,302
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to say also, Xbox One, they still have a decent lineup.

518
00:38:31,342 --> 00:38:32,782
[SPEAKER_07]: They've got all three of their games.

519
00:38:32,862 --> 00:38:45,248
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just going to say, Xbox One, as much as they've been getting the short end of the stick with their popularity on the internet, some things they do have that they're going to have on the 22nd, they will have Crimson Dragon.

520
00:38:45,928 --> 00:39:13,326
[SPEAKER_06]: Dead Rising 3, Forza Motorsport 5, Killer Instinct Although I gotta be honest, I don't care about Killer Instinct anymore Rise, and let's see, Power Star Golf It says it's exclusive, so the Xbox Fitness game as well There's also the Zumba Fitness game And yeah, and then a lot of those same third-party games we'd already mentioned before So, I mean, Xbox, it's funny, it really does have more exclusives

521
00:39:14,506 --> 00:39:18,948
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's going to be interesting to see, are people going to pay the other $100 to get in on that?

522
00:39:20,609 --> 00:39:23,230
[SPEAKER_06]: And are the exclusives good enough?

523
00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:32,033
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to be honest, when I look at this list, I go Rise, eh, Killer Instinct, maybe, but I don't like what I'm hearing about it.

524
00:39:32,413 --> 00:39:34,814
[SPEAKER_06]: Crimson Dragon, okay, yeah, I'd like to check that one out.

525
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:36,761
[SPEAKER_07]: But would that sell you a system?

526
00:39:37,182 --> 00:39:37,602
[SPEAKER_07]: Probably not.

527
00:39:37,622 --> 00:39:38,463
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think so, no.

528
00:39:39,404 --> 00:39:43,447
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, had it been a new Halo game, that might have tipped the scales.

529
00:39:43,968 --> 00:39:46,510
[SPEAKER_06]: Had it been that Quantum Break, that definitely would have tipped the scales.

530
00:39:47,411 --> 00:39:52,556
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, honestly, it comes down to the third-party games for me.

531
00:39:53,036 --> 00:39:55,479
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I would like to play Need for Speed, for sure.

532
00:39:56,119 --> 00:39:59,242
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd like to check out the LEGO game, because usually those are pretty good.

533
00:39:59,863 --> 00:39:59,983
[SPEAKER_06]: And...

534
00:40:01,164 --> 00:40:06,107
[SPEAKER_07]: But the LEGO game, I mean, if you really want to, it's coming out on the Wii U about a month before that it comes out on the other systems.

535
00:40:06,147 --> 00:40:09,489
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's not really a game that needs an X-Gen version of.

536
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:13,532
[SPEAKER_07]: And Skylanders, please, that's not a game that needs an X-Gen version of.

537
00:40:13,692 --> 00:40:15,854
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, seriously, that's going to be a port...

538
00:40:16,514 --> 00:40:18,555
[SPEAKER_07]: and Angry Birds Star Wars.

539
00:40:18,815 --> 00:40:19,155
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

540
00:40:19,515 --> 00:40:19,855
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

541
00:40:19,996 --> 00:40:20,556
[SPEAKER_06]: No one cared.

542
00:40:21,176 --> 00:40:21,556
[SPEAKER_07]: Seriously.

543
00:40:22,937 --> 00:40:27,259
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah, that's kind of where I was even when they had their full lineups.

544
00:40:27,279 --> 00:40:30,980
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, well, there's not really a lot that's selling me on these next gen systems.

545
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:36,703
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, the only first party game that looked really good to me for PlayStation 4 was Infamous Second Son.

546
00:40:36,743 --> 00:40:38,423
[SPEAKER_07]: That was like, oh, hey, that looks kind of cool.

547
00:40:38,463 --> 00:40:42,085
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, Killzone, I'm just not a fan of Killzone.

548
00:40:42,305 --> 00:40:44,406
[SPEAKER_07]: If it was a new Resistance game that looked that nice...

549
00:40:45,126 --> 00:40:46,627
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

550
00:41:07,402 --> 00:41:29,937
[SPEAKER_07]: and the PlayStation 3 has just gotten a little bit more activity now that I'm playing Grand Theft Auto on both systems but it was pretty much collecting dust and the Xbox 360 was the only thing I was playing on and a lot of people now are upgrading to the Xbox One because they figure well I've invested all this time in the Xbox 360 I might as well go along with that you know to carry over my gamer score which really doesn't mean anything folks just saying and

551
00:41:30,517 --> 00:41:31,457
[SPEAKER_07]: I got over that.

552
00:41:31,538 --> 00:41:33,958
[SPEAKER_06]: Wouldn't your trophy information on PlayStation carry over too?

553
00:41:33,998 --> 00:41:35,279
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's going to carry over too.

554
00:41:35,319 --> 00:41:36,499
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm talking about 360.

555
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:40,181
[SPEAKER_07]: That doesn't really count for anything.

556
00:41:41,921 --> 00:41:44,362
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't do that anymore.

557
00:41:44,762 --> 00:41:52,405
[SPEAKER_07]: Even when I do go to buy a system, I'm not going to buy all of the different systems out there just because I don't have time to play all of them.

558
00:41:52,805 --> 00:41:56,646
[SPEAKER_07]: Honestly, I don't want to waste money on more than one system.

559
00:41:57,487 --> 00:41:57,607
[SPEAKER_07]: So...

560
00:41:58,627 --> 00:42:09,626
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll just wait and see and I'm sure price drops will happen or at least there'll be more games out there in some time so might as well wait for something that I really want to play like an action version of Grand Theft Auto 5.

561
00:42:12,293 --> 00:42:13,053
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, we'll see.

562
00:42:14,134 --> 00:42:23,899
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, yeah, I'm curious to see how that all pans out this holiday season, like what games end up being the big seller this holiday.

563
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:31,103
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I gotta say, it's really funny, the games I'm looking forward to the most are on Wii U.

564
00:42:32,552 --> 00:42:33,413
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

565
00:42:48,636 --> 00:42:49,937
[SPEAKER_06]: So, anyway.

566
00:42:50,537 --> 00:42:51,278
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, let's move on.

567
00:42:51,558 --> 00:42:58,022
[SPEAKER_06]: Speaking of Xbox One, Xbox One not going to be doing any type of real name integration at launch.

568
00:42:58,322 --> 00:43:00,543
[SPEAKER_06]: You're still going to be using your gamer tags at launch.

569
00:43:00,843 --> 00:43:02,664
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, don't mishear me here.

570
00:43:02,684 --> 00:43:08,328
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not saying that Xbox was going to plan to switch everybody to their real names, although that would be hilarious for the trolls.

571
00:43:08,728 --> 00:43:10,369
[SPEAKER_06]: But you know I'm not here for that either.

572
00:43:10,909 --> 00:43:13,711
[SPEAKER_06]: I threw a fit when Blizzard threatened to do it with real ID.

573
00:43:13,891 --> 00:43:15,173
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

574
00:43:30,331 --> 00:43:33,332
[SPEAKER_06]: The game tags are all you're going to have on Xbox One.

575
00:43:33,992 --> 00:43:38,973
[SPEAKER_06]: They did say, quote, Our teams are working hard to deliver a quality experience for Xbox One.

576
00:43:39,373 --> 00:43:44,834
[SPEAKER_06]: This means prioritizing some features and sometimes postponing others for a later update.

577
00:43:45,674 --> 00:43:49,095
[SPEAKER_07]: Honestly, I don't miss the fact that they're not going to use my real name.

578
00:43:49,675 --> 00:43:50,215
[SPEAKER_06]: Who cares?

579
00:43:50,235 --> 00:43:51,995
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not something I really want them to use.

580
00:43:52,295 --> 00:43:54,376
[SPEAKER_06]: Did Xbox say it's coming off of Facebook?

581
00:43:54,436 --> 00:43:56,936
[SPEAKER_06]: Because if they get that from my credit card, I will not be happy.

582
00:43:58,519 --> 00:44:04,683
[SPEAKER_07]: I would imagine it would have to come from Facebook because they have alternate payment forms now.

583
00:44:04,743 --> 00:44:06,124
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not all just through a credit card.

584
00:44:06,504 --> 00:44:07,025
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess that's true.

585
00:44:08,526 --> 00:44:14,250
[SPEAKER_06]: But just so you know, the real names are how people are supposed to be able to search for you, like if they want to be able to find you or whatever.

586
00:44:14,270 --> 00:44:17,071
[SPEAKER_06]: But then I would think, well, what kind of privacy restrictions are they going to put in place?

587
00:44:17,492 --> 00:44:19,773
[SPEAKER_06]: I kind of don't want people to search for my name and find me.

588
00:44:20,474 --> 00:44:26,177
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, if I want you to find me, I'll give you my gamer tag, which any listener of this show that's ever asked for it, I've given it to them.

589
00:44:26,338 --> 00:44:28,419
[SPEAKER_07]: Honestly, there's a lot of people that share my name, so it doesn't matter.

590
00:44:28,639 --> 00:44:28,859
[SPEAKER_03]: Or... Or...

591
00:44:51,716 --> 00:45:07,544
[SPEAKER_03]: or having the maybe keeping the name secret but having it for issues of just searching if you know who you're looking for yeah that might be something different however I I don't know but yeah I gotta be honest if I want you to find me I'll give you my gamer tag

592
00:45:08,004 --> 00:45:08,564
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

593
00:45:09,204 --> 00:45:12,345
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't need you to be able to just search for my name or whatever.

594
00:45:12,385 --> 00:45:25,288
[SPEAKER_06]: I think what they're trying to do is they're trying to integrate it with Facebook even tighter so that way, you know, once it gets you to connect it one time, it's going to be like, look at all these people you don't have on your Xbox friends list yet, but you're friends with them on Facebook.

595
00:45:25,428 --> 00:45:26,128
[SPEAKER_06]: Add, add, add, add.

596
00:45:26,148 --> 00:45:34,670
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't you want to add them now so you can send them cookies and fight with them on Killer Instinct and all this stuff?

597
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:35,730
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

598
00:45:37,170 --> 00:46:05,396
[SPEAKER_06]: so going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com Ragenator says Sky why associate a credit card number with a system when there's those PSN Wii Xbox Live funds cards that are everywhere because it's an extra step no that's a good point and I try not to give them that information anymore but I think they have it on file because my Xbox Gold still comes from that and historically they would have had that information anyway so there you go

599
00:46:06,596 --> 00:46:34,813
[SPEAKER_06]: STJ100 Matt in chat says I don't really want people to know my real name here sure I want to play with people but I don't really want people to know my real name yeah I'm kind of with you and if these systems are going to reveal either one of them if it's unveiled that they're going to show the real names or whatever I'm out I'm not buying the system if that crap is in there yes I do want anonymity but it's not to troll people it's because I play video games to escape the real world sometimes so just saying

600
00:46:36,127 --> 00:46:36,407
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura

601
00:47:02,170 --> 00:47:21,505
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, for something that is not complain-worthy, something that's actually good, is that Squeenix said that Kingdom Hearts 2.5 Remix is a HD compilation that has the Kingdom Hearts 2 final mix, Birth by Sleep final mix, and the remastered cinematics from ReCoded.

602
00:47:22,526 --> 00:47:29,614
[SPEAKER_03]: and it's going to be on PS3 and is going to be out in 2014 but no mention of PS4.

603
00:47:30,816 --> 00:47:34,100
[SPEAKER_03]: So this will be coming after the 1.5 remix.

604
00:47:35,241 --> 00:47:35,661
[SPEAKER_03]: So yay.

605
00:47:36,502 --> 00:47:38,785
[SPEAKER_03]: More HD Kingdom farts.

606
00:47:41,928 --> 00:47:45,570
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw that new trailer though for Kingdom Hearts 3.

607
00:47:46,791 --> 00:47:47,532
[SPEAKER_06]: Sexy.

608
00:47:48,212 --> 00:47:48,732
[SPEAKER_06]: Sexy.

609
00:47:49,233 --> 00:47:50,494
[SPEAKER_06]: What did I say on my friend's Facebook?

610
00:47:50,514 --> 00:47:54,376
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I said this is serving up some big Thunder Mountain electric parade realness.

611
00:47:55,697 --> 00:47:58,699
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I did watch it and I was just like this looks like more Kingdom Hearts.

612
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:01,161
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it wasn't really big Thunder Mountain at all.

613
00:48:01,201 --> 00:48:03,623
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that train was part of the electric parade.

614
00:48:04,153 --> 00:48:08,217
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and the stage name was in the corner, and it didn't say Big Thunder Mountain.

615
00:48:08,918 --> 00:48:10,840
[SPEAKER_06]: Granted, they might call it something different in Japan.

616
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:11,280
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

617
00:48:11,881 --> 00:48:22,391
[SPEAKER_06]: But it was interesting that anything they did show did not incorporate any other Disney properties besides the goofy and Donald sidekicks that you expect to see.

618
00:48:22,411 --> 00:48:28,517
[SPEAKER_06]: Because you saw Traverse Town, and then you saw a big pirate ship that was flipping around in circles.

619
00:48:29,037 --> 00:48:57,730
[SPEAKER_06]: and then you didn't really like you didn't see you know Mulan World and you didn't see Tron and you didn't see you know 100 Acre Wood you didn't see any of that stuff so we still don't know exactly what's going to be represented in the game but I figure they want to keep most of that a secret for a good long while well and it also if I'm right at the two Disney parks in Japan I think that there's not a big Thunder I think that they've combined that concept with the Indiana Jones ride to have an outdoor roller coaster oh okay that sometimes runs backwards yeah

620
00:48:58,769 --> 00:49:04,832
[SPEAKER_06]: And wouldn't that be fascinating if they had an Indiana Jones level or something that incorporates the LucasArts?

621
00:49:05,052 --> 00:49:05,973
[SPEAKER_03]: They technically can.

622
00:49:06,053 --> 00:49:07,794
[SPEAKER_06]: They can, but... Marvel?

623
00:49:08,054 --> 00:49:08,814
[SPEAKER_06]: I wonder if they will.

624
00:49:09,415 --> 00:49:11,616
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that's a little bit more separate, but Marvel.

625
00:49:11,656 --> 00:49:15,938
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they're going to keep it Disney to Squeenix and leave it there.

626
00:49:16,118 --> 00:49:22,562
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they will too, but I could see a very subtle, like, here comes Indiana Jones.

627
00:49:22,622 --> 00:49:24,203
[SPEAKER_06]: I could see that being a thing.

628
00:49:24,443 --> 00:49:28,085
[SPEAKER_06]: Just a little bit of a wink and a nod to some of their recent acquisitions.

629
00:49:28,485 --> 00:49:30,507
[SPEAKER_06]: I think putting Marvel in there would be too much.

630
00:49:30,887 --> 00:49:32,788
[SPEAKER_06]: That's like a completely different universe.

631
00:49:32,808 --> 00:49:33,789
[SPEAKER_06]: What about Pixar stuff?

632
00:49:34,790 --> 00:49:35,650
[SPEAKER_06]: I really hope they do.

633
00:49:36,631 --> 00:49:38,873
[SPEAKER_06]: I think some of the Pixar games would make for great levels.

634
00:49:40,434 --> 00:49:43,636
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially with how they've been pushing the Cars franchise.

635
00:49:43,816 --> 00:49:45,938
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Cars Land and all that has been huge.

636
00:49:45,958 --> 00:49:48,860
[SPEAKER_06]: For a very short ride.

637
00:49:49,801 --> 00:49:50,241
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god.

638
00:49:51,595 --> 00:49:54,497
[SPEAKER_06]: I would love to do something in the Wall-E universe.

639
00:49:54,777 --> 00:49:59,739
[SPEAKER_06]: Wall-E is kind of set on Earth, so I don't know exactly what they would do with that, but we'll see.

640
00:49:59,939 --> 00:50:00,479
[SPEAKER_06]: Incredibles?

641
00:50:00,499 --> 00:50:01,900
[SPEAKER_06]: That'd be cool.

642
00:50:02,260 --> 00:50:08,242
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, a lot of the Pixar stories are sort of like, they're not really about their worlds so much as they are the characters, I think.

643
00:50:08,422 --> 00:50:11,243
[SPEAKER_06]: Star Wars would be cool, though.

644
00:50:11,283 --> 00:50:12,404
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Star Wars would be very cool.

645
00:50:13,744 --> 00:50:15,905
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, did you see the other news about Kingdom Hearts 3?

646
00:50:17,286 --> 00:50:19,687
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I let me, uh, no.

647
00:50:20,047 --> 00:50:20,187
Sorry.

648
00:50:21,433 --> 00:50:23,615
[SPEAKER_03]: Because my iPad's being a shit again.

649
00:50:24,196 --> 00:50:24,516
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on.

650
00:50:25,197 --> 00:50:25,537
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

651
00:50:25,657 --> 00:50:41,151
[SPEAKER_03]: I do believe that there is a little bit more news and of course it is something that we're pretty aware was going to happen regardless is that Utada Hikaru may return for Kingdom Hearts 3 which I think is probably going to happen.

652
00:50:41,593 --> 00:50:42,693
[SPEAKER_06]: She really should, I mean.

653
00:50:43,113 --> 00:50:45,254
[SPEAKER_06]: But she's been on a musical hiatus or something, right?

654
00:50:45,474 --> 00:50:47,154
[SPEAKER_06]: Didn't she take a break or something?

655
00:50:47,494 --> 00:51:03,737
[SPEAKER_03]: She did, but there was actually a post that came from Utada Teruzane, who is her dad, who said that the two of them were undecided when it came to Kingdom Hearts 3.

656
00:51:05,417 --> 00:51:08,978
[SPEAKER_03]: So she's not contributing a new theme song, but there's a chance she might help.

657
00:51:10,137 --> 00:51:12,438
[SPEAKER_06]: I sure hope she does do something with it.

658
00:51:12,518 --> 00:51:13,038
[SPEAKER_06]: It'd be great.

659
00:51:13,058 --> 00:51:18,080
[SPEAKER_06]: Because the songs, especially Simple and Clean, was so important to Kingdom Hearts, you know?

660
00:51:18,420 --> 00:51:19,701
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

661
00:51:19,761 --> 00:51:23,202
[SPEAKER_06]: Codeman in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, Wreck-It Ralph World?

662
00:51:23,602 --> 00:51:24,403
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be too meta.

663
00:51:24,583 --> 00:51:25,223
[SPEAKER_06]: That's too meta.

664
00:51:25,563 --> 00:51:27,824
[SPEAKER_06]: Although, Sugar Rush would be pretty great.

665
00:51:28,325 --> 00:51:29,586
[SPEAKER_06]: I could still see them doing that.

666
00:51:29,626 --> 00:51:30,186
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be pretty cool.

667
00:51:30,206 --> 00:51:33,648
[SPEAKER_06]: Like a Sugar Rush level would be kind of, like just even like instead of the gummy ship.

668
00:51:35,490 --> 00:51:36,991
[SPEAKER_06]: Tangled, I could see Tangled.

669
00:51:37,351 --> 00:51:38,852
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I could totally see Tangled.

670
00:51:38,992 --> 00:51:39,953
[SPEAKER_06]: I kind of hope they do that.

671
00:51:39,973 --> 00:51:41,073
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be great.

672
00:51:41,093 --> 00:51:42,054
[SPEAKER_07]: You know which one?

673
00:51:42,094 --> 00:51:42,854
[SPEAKER_06]: The festival lights.

674
00:51:42,874 --> 00:51:43,735
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, have they done this yet?

675
00:51:43,775 --> 00:51:44,936
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I liked it.

676
00:51:44,996 --> 00:51:45,816
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought it was a good movie.

677
00:51:45,896 --> 00:51:46,757
[SPEAKER_07]: Emperor's New Groove.

678
00:51:47,546 --> 00:51:48,526
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if they ever did.

679
00:51:48,646 --> 00:51:50,147
[SPEAKER_06]: Unless they did it in one of the handheld games.

680
00:51:50,187 --> 00:51:50,827
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think they did.

681
00:51:53,288 --> 00:51:53,669
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

682
00:51:54,149 --> 00:51:58,671
[SPEAKER_06]: SSJ100Matt says, Indiana Jones in Kingdom Hearts would be better than the Crystal Skull.

683
00:51:59,191 --> 00:52:00,011
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, ain't that the truth.

684
00:52:01,032 --> 00:52:02,332
[SPEAKER_06]: I have bars low.

685
00:52:02,852 --> 00:52:05,093
[SPEAKER_06]: Shia LaBeouf is not allowed to be in Kingdom Hearts.

686
00:52:05,814 --> 00:52:08,695
[SPEAKER_06]: Do not let that kid anywhere near Kingdom Hearts.

687
00:52:09,876 --> 00:52:13,238
[SPEAKER_06]: You keep Shia LaBeouf away from Kingdom Hearts.

688
00:52:14,019 --> 00:52:14,800
[SPEAKER_06]: Not gonna happen.

689
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:17,182
[SPEAKER_06]: Ooh, Actdeft is suggesting Brave.

690
00:52:17,382 --> 00:52:18,943
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be a great Pixar movie.

691
00:52:19,424 --> 00:52:20,204
[SPEAKER_06]: I can see that, yeah.

692
00:52:20,244 --> 00:52:21,866
[SPEAKER_06]: I can totally see that as well.

693
00:52:21,886 --> 00:52:22,766
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be great.

694
00:52:23,127 --> 00:52:31,974
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, anyhow, we could fan-wank Kingdom Hearts worlds all day long, but the reality is we are just not gonna know until they make some formal announcements, so we'll see what happens.

695
00:52:32,334 --> 00:52:32,575
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki!

696
00:52:33,275 --> 00:52:36,878
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, so some other good news for the Xbox One platform.

697
00:52:37,519 --> 00:52:58,697
[SPEAKER_07]: They are making available to all the developers the Xbox Live Compute, I don't know if you would call it, I guess, SDK, which is basically the ability to use the cloud servers for off-platform computations, including physics, and more importantly, dedicated servers.

698
00:52:59,298 --> 00:53:00,479
[SPEAKER_07]: And so because of that,

699
00:53:01,279 --> 00:53:16,405
[SPEAKER_07]: Dedicated servers for all multiplayer games is possible, but it has to be enabled by the developers because they can also choose to have control over that versus using the Xbox Live Compute stuff.

700
00:53:17,306 --> 00:53:26,110
[SPEAKER_07]: And I guess they're saying that they have over 300,000 virtual servers powered by cloud technology.

701
00:53:26,190 --> 00:53:26,370
[SPEAKER_07]: So...

702
00:53:27,410 --> 00:53:36,394
[SPEAKER_07]: Sounds like they could get some... I mean, that's definitely a plus for a lot of people that play multiplayer, especially like Call of Duty and stuff, that you're going to have dedicated servers.

703
00:53:36,594 --> 00:53:45,678
[SPEAKER_07]: And also kind of curbs cheating a bit, because there's people that hack the platforms and stuff, and having a dedicated server would kind of eliminate that.

704
00:53:47,219 --> 00:53:47,959
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds ambitious.

705
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:51,381
[SPEAKER_02]: And entirely a good idea.

706
00:53:51,401 --> 00:53:51,481
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

707
00:53:52,361 --> 00:53:53,923
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just curious to see how stable that all is.

708
00:54:04,697 --> 00:54:11,081
[SPEAKER_07]: Every company comes out and says, Hey, yeah, we've seen these problems with connectivity and stuff like that.

709
00:54:11,221 --> 00:54:13,323
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not going to happen to us.

710
00:54:13,363 --> 00:54:14,463
[SPEAKER_07]: We're prepared this time.

711
00:54:15,104 --> 00:54:18,106
[SPEAKER_07]: And every time, it's fucked up.

712
00:54:19,466 --> 00:54:25,550
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm kind of curious to see how all these servers are going to play into that, or if it's just going to be a big fucking mess.

713
00:54:25,630 --> 00:54:25,970
[SPEAKER_07]: Because...

714
00:54:27,431 --> 00:54:33,893
[SPEAKER_07]: I wouldn't be surprised if it was a big fucking mess just because all the other, you know, online games and stuff have just been mess.

715
00:54:34,533 --> 00:54:43,636
[SPEAKER_06]: What will be the first Xbox game to get that error 37 equivalent or the SimCity connection error and all these hilarities in the past?

716
00:54:43,676 --> 00:54:45,457
[SPEAKER_07]: The one that I could see would be the biggest...

717
00:54:46,317 --> 00:54:55,881
[SPEAKER_07]: Paying the ass would maybe be fours of five, because remember you have to download part of the game, or most of the game, because it's not done yet on the disc.

718
00:54:57,162 --> 00:55:00,283
[SPEAKER_07]: I can see that being a problem if you can't connect to their cloud servers.

719
00:55:02,024 --> 00:55:06,366
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, the other thing, remember, just like Rockstar just had the problem where it wasn't necessarily...

720
00:55:06,946 --> 00:55:10,708
[SPEAKER_07]: All of the cloud service, but mainly the matchmaking stuff was down.

721
00:55:11,128 --> 00:55:16,471
[SPEAKER_07]: And so even if you have a part of your service down, that could still affect everything.

722
00:55:17,131 --> 00:55:18,472
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't know.

723
00:55:20,433 --> 00:55:21,273
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

724
00:55:42,384 --> 00:55:48,887
[SPEAKER_07]: It makes me think that there's a little bit more hype to it than is actually going to be reality.

725
00:55:48,947 --> 00:55:51,568
[SPEAKER_07]: So I guess we'll have to see when it launches.

726
00:55:51,628 --> 00:55:54,309
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure we'll be talking about stories of connectivity.

727
00:55:54,429 --> 00:55:58,631
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not saying it's probably limited to Microsoft at all.

728
00:55:59,451 --> 00:56:03,333
[SPEAKER_07]: If the PlayStation 4 relies heavily on cloud servers, then yeah, it's probably going to be everybody.

729
00:56:03,922 --> 00:56:04,222
[SPEAKER_06]: Cyan Inc.

730
00:56:04,242 --> 00:56:05,023
[SPEAKER_06]: Cyan Inc.

731
00:56:30,621 --> 00:56:33,003
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, they have announced that they are making a new game.

732
00:56:33,323 --> 00:56:34,605
[SPEAKER_06]: It's called Abduction.

733
00:56:35,025 --> 00:56:35,986
[SPEAKER_06]: Not Abduction.

734
00:56:36,246 --> 00:56:38,408
[SPEAKER_06]: It's O-B-D-U-C-T-I-O-N.

735
00:56:38,708 --> 00:56:40,409
[SPEAKER_06]: Abduction is the new game.

736
00:56:40,690 --> 00:56:41,650
[SPEAKER_06]: But here's the interesting thing.

737
00:56:41,991 --> 00:56:43,132
[SPEAKER_06]: It is a Kickstarter game.

738
00:56:43,192 --> 00:56:45,193
[SPEAKER_06]: This is where they're taking their case to Kickstarter.

739
00:56:45,454 --> 00:56:50,017
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're trying to get $1.1 million to make this game work.

740
00:56:50,478 --> 00:56:55,202
[SPEAKER_06]: They're talking about very similar exploration-driven gameplay that helped make Myst a reality.

741
00:56:56,723 --> 00:56:58,364
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to do Unreal Engine 4.

742
00:56:59,205 --> 00:57:01,406
[SPEAKER_06]: is what they want to be able to license to make this game work.

743
00:57:01,927 --> 00:57:04,108
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're targeting mid to late 2015.

744
00:57:04,789 --> 00:57:09,071
[SPEAKER_06]: So they're giving themselves plenty of time to make abduction happen.

745
00:57:09,732 --> 00:57:11,853
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you want to check that out, you can go to their Kickstarter.

746
00:57:12,253 --> 00:57:18,497
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, the thing that really got me about this though is I'm like, dude, this is the studio that made Myst and Riven.

747
00:57:18,677 --> 00:57:21,039
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, why do they have to turn to Kickstarter?

748
00:57:21,219 --> 00:57:25,301
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, surely there's a publisher or somebody out there that's willing to back them a little bit.

749
00:57:25,601 --> 00:57:27,683
[SPEAKER_06]: So I was kind of like, well, what the hell else have they done?

750
00:57:28,323 --> 00:57:30,064
[SPEAKER_06]: Outside of Riven and Myst.

751
00:57:30,104 --> 00:57:33,266
[SPEAKER_06]: Anybody know, without cheating, what some of the other games Cyan Inc.

752
00:57:33,326 --> 00:57:34,847
[SPEAKER_06]: did in the downtime?

753
00:57:35,328 --> 00:57:41,011
[SPEAKER_06]: Because once I went to go look at the list, I was like, oh yeah, there was that game that really didn't do well.

754
00:57:41,271 --> 00:57:48,336
[SPEAKER_07]: It was the one that was that Myst, not Myst Online or whatever the hell they ended up calling it, that was part of, wasn't GameTap actually?

755
00:57:48,396 --> 00:57:50,537
[SPEAKER_06]: It was Myst Online, Uru Live.

756
00:57:50,697 --> 00:57:52,238
[SPEAKER_06]: You're right, that's it.

757
00:57:52,338 --> 00:57:53,199
[SPEAKER_06]: It went over to GameTap.

758
00:57:53,219 --> 00:57:54,900
[SPEAKER_06]: There were a lot of Uru games actually.

759
00:57:54,980 --> 00:57:56,501
[SPEAKER_06]: Uru, I think, was the third Myst game.

760
00:57:56,721 --> 00:58:24,141
[SPEAKER_06]: and then they did all these different Uru games that Ubisoft was doing for a while including Myst 5, went all the way there and then Myst Online, yeah I remember that game kind of flopped and GameTap picked it up and ran it for a little while I actually played Myst Online, the funny thing is back in 2007 this show was around and I think there's some old episodes where I was talking about my experiences in Myst Online it was just such an odd game, like I don't mean that in a bad way, it was just like, it was so like just

761
00:58:24,501 --> 00:58:30,425
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of creepy, odd, like the ambience in that game was really like chills.

762
00:58:30,505 --> 00:58:42,593
[SPEAKER_06]: But I mean, I enjoyed what I did play of it, even though it wasn't as obvious of a game as World of Warcraft or even EverQuest where it's like experience leads to levels, leads to abilities, leads to gold, gold, gold.

763
00:58:42,853 --> 00:58:45,715
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, Uru Online was a very different type of game.

764
00:58:46,435 --> 00:58:47,656
[SPEAKER_06]: Other than that, that was 2007.

765
00:58:48,017 --> 00:58:52,640
[SPEAKER_06]: And since then, it's been a lot of iPhone, iPod, iPad type of stuff.

766
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:54,481
[SPEAKER_06]: They adapted Myst.

767
00:58:54,841 --> 00:58:55,922
[SPEAKER_06]: They adapted Riven.

768
00:58:56,222 --> 00:58:59,184
[SPEAKER_06]: They did some games called Bug Chucker and Stone Ship.

769
00:58:59,504 --> 00:59:03,067
[SPEAKER_06]: So Abduction is a very kind of anxious...

770
00:59:04,047 --> 00:59:06,569
[SPEAKER_06]: Return to form, shall we say, for this company.

771
00:59:07,049 --> 00:59:08,310
[SPEAKER_06]: And best of luck to them.

772
00:59:08,610 --> 00:59:09,851
[SPEAKER_06]: They just might do it.

773
00:59:09,871 --> 00:59:11,812
[SPEAKER_06]: They got a $1.1 million goal.

774
00:59:12,132 --> 00:59:14,574
[SPEAKER_06]: They have raised just shy of half a million.

775
00:59:14,594 --> 00:59:17,816
[SPEAKER_06]: They're at $460,000 with 26 days to go.

776
00:59:18,516 --> 00:59:23,740
[SPEAKER_06]: So they've already made between a third and a half of the money with only four days down.

777
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:26,561
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's pretty cool.

778
00:59:26,581 --> 00:59:30,864
[SPEAKER_06]: $25 or more will get you the game via Kickstarter, by the way.

779
00:59:31,185 --> 00:59:32,405
[SPEAKER_06]: $45 is a digital collection.

780
00:59:32,706 --> 00:59:35,047
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see some of the crazy rewards they're giving.

781
00:59:35,207 --> 00:59:40,631
[SPEAKER_06]: $10,000 or more will give you an experience design at Cyan.

782
00:59:40,651 --> 00:59:44,313
[SPEAKER_06]: You can actually go to an early abduction design meeting.

783
00:59:44,894 --> 00:59:47,476
[SPEAKER_06]: You can either go there or join via Skype.

784
00:59:48,056 --> 00:59:50,077
[SPEAKER_06]: And I guess you get to have your say in the game.

785
00:59:50,678 --> 00:59:51,058
[SPEAKER_06]: Kind of neat.

786
00:59:52,697 --> 00:59:53,197
[SPEAKER_06]: So there you go.

787
00:59:53,578 --> 01:00:01,842
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're already looking at stretch goals too, but they won't say what they are until they reach the base funding, which I imagine would just be more expansions of the game and so on and so on.

788
01:00:02,423 --> 01:00:08,226
[SPEAKER_06]: So going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com, SSJ100Matt says, Mist was odd.

789
01:00:08,326 --> 01:00:09,167
[SPEAKER_06]: I should go back to it.

790
01:00:09,467 --> 01:00:11,708
[SPEAKER_06]: I still have the original CD-ROM copy laying around.

791
01:00:13,069 --> 01:00:17,272
[SPEAKER_06]: Ragenator says, The Riven original soundtrack is great to play if you're having trouble sleeping.

792
01:00:18,012 --> 01:00:25,108
[SPEAKER_06]: Dungeon Buster says Cyan went the way that a lot of adventure games did in the 90s, which is probably why they're kickstarting this project.

793
01:00:25,448 --> 01:00:28,655
[SPEAKER_06]: Tim Schafer had to kickstart his own adventure game just to get it going.

794
01:00:29,164 --> 01:00:51,054
[SPEAKER_06]: well it's so interesting because a lot of these projects end up being very successful so it's surprising to me and especially with how well The Walking Dead did last year and was so well received and everything I'm like I'm really surprised that the mainstream is not getting like dude people never really got over the 90s adventure game thing like there's still very much an audience for that you know

795
01:00:53,681 --> 01:00:59,586
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, Ragenator says, SSJ100, Matt, is that even playable on modern PCs?

796
01:00:59,846 --> 01:01:06,612
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, they had it in GameTap, and even though GameTap is a few years old at this point, you definitely could play all those games.

797
01:01:07,353 --> 01:01:09,655
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure it's got to be on good old games, right?

798
01:01:09,695 --> 01:01:10,856
[SPEAKER_06]: Myst has to be there.

799
01:01:10,956 --> 01:01:12,197
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got to be.

800
01:01:12,858 --> 01:01:13,498
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, there you go.

801
01:01:13,538 --> 01:01:16,000
[SPEAKER_06]: So good luck to the studio getting that going.

802
01:01:16,141 --> 01:01:17,502
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll be exciting if they get it done.

803
01:01:18,423 --> 01:01:20,264
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope it's as creepy as other games.

804
01:01:20,845 --> 01:01:21,205
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.

805
01:01:22,034 --> 01:01:24,497
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Rob, this actually may affect you.

806
01:01:24,838 --> 01:01:25,759
[SPEAKER_03]: May or may not affect you.

807
01:01:26,941 --> 01:01:29,084
[SPEAKER_03]: And 50,000 other people that I know fucking play this game.

808
01:01:29,124 --> 01:01:30,025
[SPEAKER_06]: Do I have to go get a shot?

809
01:01:30,313 --> 01:01:31,234
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no.

810
01:01:31,394 --> 01:01:32,214
[SPEAKER_03]: But there is a bug.

811
01:01:33,015 --> 01:01:35,517
[SPEAKER_03]: However, it's not a sickness bug.

812
01:01:35,577 --> 01:01:39,700
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a sickness within Pokemon X and Y. Also the entire game.

813
01:01:40,360 --> 01:01:41,021
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the whole game.

814
01:01:41,181 --> 01:01:41,341
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

815
01:01:42,041 --> 01:01:54,770
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, if you save your game in Lumio City, there is a problem where if you save in and around the streets outside the city, the game will lock up and make you have to reset your game.

816
01:01:55,151 --> 01:01:58,493
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you reboot, the game will load the save and freeze again.

817
01:01:58,513 --> 01:01:59,814
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, it loops and loops and loops.

818
01:02:00,415 --> 01:02:09,277
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, Nintendo is aware of this and they're working on making a patch for it that will be downloaded when they have it done.

819
01:02:10,882 --> 01:02:12,703
[SPEAKER_03]: So at least they know about it.

820
01:02:12,803 --> 01:02:14,163
[SPEAKER_03]: At least something's going to happen.

821
01:02:14,763 --> 01:02:16,824
[SPEAKER_03]: It just hasn't happened quite yet.

822
01:02:17,064 --> 01:02:19,185
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, they're saying they've put out a map.

823
01:02:19,265 --> 01:02:26,347
[SPEAKER_03]: It's only a Japanese one, which I will go ahead and also link to the chat room, assuming it loads.

824
01:02:27,027 --> 01:02:33,989
[SPEAKER_03]: But for those of you who are affected by this, sorry, start over and don't save in the town.

825
01:02:36,536 --> 01:02:41,743
[SPEAKER_05]: To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase rainbow.

826
01:02:50,201 --> 01:02:52,542
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm going to make a note of that, so I don't do that.

827
01:02:52,622 --> 01:02:56,003
[SPEAKER_06]: But I do like how in the new Pokemon games you can practically save anywhere.

828
01:02:56,783 --> 01:02:57,464
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's pretty cool.

829
01:02:57,784 --> 01:02:58,104
[SPEAKER_06]: Useful.

830
01:02:58,824 --> 01:02:59,424
[SPEAKER_06]: Much useful.

831
01:02:59,764 --> 01:03:01,805
[SPEAKER_06]: Better than trying to find a save point and do it that way.

832
01:03:02,085 --> 01:03:02,545
[SPEAKER_06]: That's for sure.

833
01:03:02,985 --> 01:03:03,225
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

834
01:03:03,966 --> 01:03:10,228
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates of some games coming out soon that hopefully aren't broken, that have hopefully been quality tested.

835
01:03:10,908 --> 01:03:17,450
[SPEAKER_06]: Which is, by the way, not to get all like tangenty or whatever, but that's the good thing about those other games you were talking about earlier getting delayed.

836
01:03:17,830 --> 01:03:21,531
[SPEAKER_06]: Like things like, you know, Drive Club and Watch Dogs and everything.

837
01:03:22,011 --> 01:03:22,431
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

838
01:03:22,971 --> 01:03:28,233
[SPEAKER_06]: If they have to do that to QA the games and make sure that they're going to be right, then fine.

839
01:03:28,413 --> 01:03:28,913
[SPEAKER_06]: Delay them.

840
01:03:29,013 --> 01:03:30,513
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll never remember that they were delayed.

841
01:03:30,673 --> 01:03:32,274
[SPEAKER_06]: Wasn't Grand Theft Auto V delayed a bunch?

842
01:03:32,394 --> 01:03:32,654
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

843
01:03:32,774 --> 01:03:33,574
[SPEAKER_06]: We all forgave them.

844
01:03:34,114 --> 01:03:34,934
[SPEAKER_06]: We forgive them, right?

845
01:03:35,334 --> 01:03:36,155
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was worth it.

846
01:03:36,215 --> 01:03:36,555
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

847
01:03:36,595 --> 01:03:37,115
[SPEAKER_06]: It was worth it.

848
01:03:37,615 --> 01:03:39,196
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know what?

849
01:03:39,316 --> 01:03:42,758
[SPEAKER_06]: I would rather the games get delayed to test the QA.

850
01:03:43,039 --> 01:03:44,940
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, in this Pokemon, I don't know.

851
01:03:44,980 --> 01:03:50,523
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, like, because you can save anywhere, like, I don't know if they would have found that during QA testing or whatever.

852
01:03:50,884 --> 01:03:52,765
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be a very tricky thing to find.

853
01:03:52,965 --> 01:03:53,385
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be.

854
01:03:53,445 --> 01:04:00,650
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I mean, I forgive them, but Nintendo's got to be able to patch these things faster and more efficiently, too, I think in some ways.

855
01:04:01,010 --> 01:04:29,596
[SPEAKER_06]: you know what I mean like you kind of expect on Xbox and Playstation it's always going to patch right away if they have them Nintendo can kind of be a pain in the butt they haven't quite figured out this whole internet thing yet yeah that's and I think that's part of what's their worst nightmare right now with Wii U I'm still convinced that plays into it I mean my friends have made good arguments about to the contrary and about how you know there is DLC for like Assassin's Creed now they just started that a year ago but see there's something about all of that

856
01:04:30,596 --> 01:04:46,295
[SPEAKER_06]: and the fact that nothing ever showed up for Mass Effect 3 nothing showed up for Injustice and all that just kind of nothing showing up for Assassin's Creed 4 there's something really weird about that I mean granted Nintendo's doing it themselves now with Super Luigi and all this other stuff but are they doing it differently than it was done on 360?

857
01:04:46,575 --> 01:04:47,937
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know so

858
01:04:49,764 --> 01:04:52,125
[SPEAKER_07]: and EA Uplay has a channel on Wii U though

859
01:05:18,619 --> 01:05:20,440
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, well then I don't know.

860
01:05:21,040 --> 01:05:21,860
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe they changed something.

861
01:05:22,760 --> 01:05:23,140
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

862
01:05:23,240 --> 01:05:25,721
[SPEAKER_06]: Or maybe it's trickier on Nintendo or something.

863
01:05:25,741 --> 01:05:25,981
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

864
01:05:26,001 --> 01:05:28,962
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, Tangent Train, Choo Choo, let's go to release dates.

865
01:05:29,302 --> 01:05:31,402
[SPEAKER_07]: So this week we actually have quite a few things coming out.

866
01:05:31,803 --> 01:05:38,844
[SPEAKER_07]: Starting off with Naruto Shippuden, Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 Full Burst, which is a re-release of the game with DLC, PS3, and 360.

867
01:05:39,405 --> 01:05:47,627
[SPEAKER_07]: For that, Deus Ex Human Revolution The Director's Cut coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and debuting on the Wii U.

868
01:05:48,968 --> 01:05:51,651
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and of course those are re-released for, you know, the other two platforms.

869
01:05:52,212 --> 01:06:00,962
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, Spongebob, Plankton's Robotic Revenge on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, Wii U, 3DS, and DS.

870
01:06:01,603 --> 01:06:05,067
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, Hometown Story, if you're a fan of the Harvest Moon games, it is

871
01:06:05,847 --> 01:06:06,928
[SPEAKER_07]: Sort of a spin-off of that.

872
01:06:07,729 --> 01:06:08,970
[SPEAKER_07]: That's on 3DS this week.

873
01:06:09,250 --> 01:06:19,378
[SPEAKER_07]: LEGO Marvel Super Heroes on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii U, 3DS, and Vita and PC.

874
01:06:20,479 --> 01:06:22,321
[SPEAKER_07]: The Sims 3 Into the Future.

875
01:06:23,322 --> 01:06:25,163
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a new expansion.

876
01:06:25,403 --> 01:06:26,484
[SPEAKER_07]: That's on PC, of course.

877
01:06:28,146 --> 01:06:28,286
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

878
01:06:29,967 --> 01:06:30,707
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.

879
01:06:30,988 --> 01:06:36,390
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, Disney Infinity, some more of the packs are coming out.

880
01:06:36,450 --> 01:06:40,032
[SPEAKER_07]: Toy Story, as well as the Woody figure.

881
01:06:40,312 --> 01:06:44,174
[SPEAKER_07]: And I believe next, not next week, but the week after next is Jack Skellington.

882
01:06:44,194 --> 01:06:46,135
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to say, where the hell is Nightmare Before Christmas?

883
01:06:46,195 --> 01:06:47,015
[SPEAKER_07]: It's that time of year, right?

884
01:06:47,035 --> 01:06:50,056
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it's been a GameStop exclusive for right now.

885
01:06:51,277 --> 01:06:52,157
[SPEAKER_07]: Exclusive on the figurine.

886
01:06:52,177 --> 01:06:55,759
[SPEAKER_07]: And Woody, I think, is exclusive to Walmart or Target or Toys R Us, one of those stores.

887
01:06:55,899 --> 01:06:58,320
[SPEAKER_06]: I got an exclusive finger for GameStop right here.

888
01:06:59,721 --> 01:07:01,342
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry to the employees.

889
01:07:01,482 --> 01:07:03,843
[SPEAKER_06]: My anger is not with you, the front-end associates.

890
01:07:04,964 --> 01:07:23,033
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want to get some 2K games that have been out before, there are some collections coming out, including the 2K Essentials collection, which is, I believe, Bioshock, Borderlands, and I want to say... Oh, what the hell was the last game there?

891
01:07:23,053 --> 01:07:23,313
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't...

892
01:07:23,533 --> 01:07:27,256
[SPEAKER_07]: XCOM, the first XCOM game that was on 360.

893
01:07:28,117 --> 01:07:30,879
[SPEAKER_07]: Not really the first XCOM game.

894
01:07:30,959 --> 01:07:31,260
[SPEAKER_07]: On 360.

895
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:32,841
[SPEAKER_06]: You'd be going back to the 90s.

896
01:07:32,861 --> 01:07:34,462
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I said the first XCOM game on 360.

897
01:07:34,963 --> 01:07:35,783
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, okay.

898
01:07:35,803 --> 01:07:36,444
[SPEAKER_07]: In PS3.

899
01:07:36,464 --> 01:07:39,727
[SPEAKER_07]: That's on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

900
01:07:39,767 --> 01:07:48,134
[SPEAKER_07]: They also have another collection, the Strategy Collection, which is Civ V and XCOM.

901
01:07:48,294 --> 01:07:48,894
[SPEAKER_07]: That's on PC.

902
01:07:50,576 --> 01:07:55,281
[SPEAKER_07]: and then there's another one with, I don't remember, I'll get to that in just a second here.

903
01:07:55,501 --> 01:08:00,366
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see, Rocksmith 2014 edition coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and PC.

904
01:08:00,726 --> 01:08:09,856
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, they also have a version without the little adapter in case you bought the game before and a version with a guitar because, you know, you need a guitar for that game.

905
01:08:11,056 --> 01:08:14,777
[SPEAKER_07]: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles on 3DS, Wii, and Xbox 360.

906
01:08:15,237 --> 01:08:19,179
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's based on the new cartoon series on Nickelodeon.

907
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:24,040
[SPEAKER_07]: Just Dance Kids 2014 on Wii and Wii U and Xbox 360.

908
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:25,700
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, God, there's a kids game this year, too?

909
01:08:26,101 --> 01:08:27,781
[SPEAKER_07]: There's been a kids game for the last few years.

910
01:08:28,221 --> 01:08:29,541
[SPEAKER_06]: I knew there was the one.

911
01:08:29,782 --> 01:08:32,002
[SPEAKER_06]: There's four kids games last year.

912
01:08:32,322 --> 01:08:35,583
[SPEAKER_06]: God, does it have that horrible... God, that joke.

913
01:08:35,743 --> 01:08:38,404
[SPEAKER_06]: No, the... What does the fox say about...

914
01:08:40,525 --> 01:08:41,686
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, but that would be pretty funny.

915
01:08:41,826 --> 01:08:43,928
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my god, that song gets on my nerves so bad.

916
01:08:43,988 --> 01:08:47,550
[SPEAKER_02]: I've finally, by the way, seen that, and I was sorry I saw that.

917
01:08:47,570 --> 01:08:51,312
[SPEAKER_06]: They play it on the radio now, and I'm like, okay, that was funny for a day.

918
01:08:51,512 --> 01:08:51,933
[SPEAKER_06]: Stop.

919
01:08:52,653 --> 01:08:54,114
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so glad I don't listen to the radio.

920
01:08:54,915 --> 01:08:57,096
[SPEAKER_03]: It made me laugh the first time, and after that I was like, yeah.

921
01:08:57,276 --> 01:09:00,719
[SPEAKER_07]: And my wife has told me, and I also saw this, but I actually haven't listened to this song yet.

922
01:09:00,739 --> 01:09:02,240
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, apparently it's a huge kids song.

923
01:09:02,780 --> 01:09:03,441
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a kids thing.

924
01:09:03,641 --> 01:09:04,602
[SPEAKER_06]: The What Does the Fox Say.

925
01:09:05,562 --> 01:09:08,725
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought it was a stoner song because it was a bunch of stoners jumping around.

926
01:09:09,586 --> 01:09:10,947
[SPEAKER_06]: What does the bong say?

927
01:09:12,731 --> 01:09:15,292
[SPEAKER_07]: What about that Chinese food song?

928
01:09:16,072 --> 01:09:17,713
[SPEAKER_06]: Now that, I'm here for that.

929
01:09:18,213 --> 01:09:22,555
[SPEAKER_06]: That song cracked my ass up and the video is fantastic.

930
01:09:22,615 --> 01:09:24,355
[SPEAKER_03]: I hated myself for finding it funny.

931
01:09:24,595 --> 01:09:25,916
[SPEAKER_06]: I have not seen that song yet.

932
01:09:26,036 --> 01:09:28,557
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh no, the Chinese food, that's great.

933
01:09:28,577 --> 01:09:32,138
[SPEAKER_03]: Just seeing that guy take the panda thing off, I'm like, it's that dude!

934
01:09:32,398 --> 01:10:00,720
[SPEAKER_06]: it's the little things too the like little subtly horribly racist things in the video like when they're talking like they're playing Monopoly like he rhymes some freaking Chinese who a Monopoly and then he moves the piece to Oriental Avenue in the video it's like they're going for every it's like they're going for every fucking stereotype in the universe oh but I I love its badness but then again like Showgirls is my favorite movie so it's sort of like I don't know if it's trying to be Lisa Lampanelli style funny but

935
01:10:01,741 --> 01:10:02,221
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

936
01:10:29,001 --> 01:10:42,110
[SPEAKER_07]: and then Wii Party U for the Wii U. This game was so great looking that they also had to throw a remote in there and a horizontal stand for your... What games are in Wii Party U?

937
01:10:42,490 --> 01:10:43,651
[SPEAKER_06]: I know nothing about this game.

938
01:10:43,991 --> 01:10:44,591
[SPEAKER_07]: It's crap.

939
01:10:44,752 --> 01:10:46,092
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, We Party was terrible.

940
01:10:46,252 --> 01:10:47,053
[SPEAKER_07]: It's gonna be crap.

941
01:10:47,093 --> 01:10:49,494
[SPEAKER_06]: In Soviet Russia, We Party You!

942
01:10:50,495 --> 01:10:52,156
[SPEAKER_06]: Just what the name makes me think.

943
01:10:52,536 --> 01:10:52,716
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

944
01:10:53,096 --> 01:10:54,297
[SPEAKER_07]: Some other random games coming out.

945
01:10:54,357 --> 01:11:00,721
[SPEAKER_07]: Cradle of Egypt 2, which is a puzzle game, and Girls Fashion Shoot, which is a fashion simulator game.

946
01:11:00,921 --> 01:11:01,481
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.

947
01:11:02,021 --> 01:11:02,662
[SPEAKER_07]: That is it.

948
01:11:02,822 --> 01:11:03,782
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be everything.

949
01:11:04,263 --> 01:11:04,743
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yay.

950
01:11:05,063 --> 01:11:10,026
[SPEAKER_07]: Although, I do have to say this week, though, I believe is also the DLC for Saints Row 4.

951
01:11:10,567 --> 01:11:13,549
[SPEAKER_07]: So, there's some DLC coming out for that.

952
01:11:13,949 --> 01:11:16,531
[SPEAKER_07]: The Enter the Dominatrix stuff.

953
01:11:16,991 --> 01:11:17,311
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

954
01:11:17,852 --> 01:11:21,874
[SPEAKER_06]: Now's the part of the show where you get to hear me horribly butcher Japanese release dates.

955
01:11:21,954 --> 01:11:22,395
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay!

956
01:11:22,835 --> 01:11:33,542
[SPEAKER_06]: On the PlayStation 3 in Japan on October 24th, BlazBlue Chrono Phantasma comes out, as well as GQ Powerful Pro Yaku 2013, which is that soccer?

957
01:11:33,602 --> 01:11:34,082
[SPEAKER_06]: It's baseball.

958
01:11:34,283 --> 01:11:34,763
[SPEAKER_06]: Baseball.

959
01:11:35,904 --> 01:11:36,845
[SPEAKER_06]: Tears to Tiara 2, Hau no Matsue

960
01:11:54,783 --> 01:11:59,087
[SPEAKER_06]: That's, I don't know, but it looks like some type of role-playing-esque game.

961
01:12:00,388 --> 01:12:01,289
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what this is.

962
01:12:01,809 --> 01:12:03,831
[SPEAKER_06]: This is like half the other things I see come out.

963
01:12:04,752 --> 01:12:05,392
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see what else there is.

964
01:12:05,472 --> 01:12:19,063
[SPEAKER_06]: Root Double Before Crime, After Days Extended Edition, and Kazuko Kyaku Tomogu Ito in Regular and Limited Edition from Cyberfront this week, which looks like... Okay, I'm looking at a screenshot from this game.

965
01:12:19,083 --> 01:12:19,163
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

966
01:12:20,279 --> 01:12:23,422
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm sorry, but those breasts are like too much.

967
01:12:23,803 --> 01:12:25,004
[SPEAKER_06]: For that face.

968
01:12:25,324 --> 01:12:32,011
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, for that cute little chibi face, she's got these breasts like she would be tipping forward.

969
01:12:32,031 --> 01:12:32,812
[SPEAKER_06]: She is tipping forward.

970
01:12:32,832 --> 01:12:38,598
[SPEAKER_03]: However, I can say I was quite young and quite stacked.

971
01:12:39,059 --> 01:12:39,379
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah?

972
01:12:39,639 --> 01:12:40,360
[SPEAKER_03]: So it is possible.

973
01:12:40,380 --> 01:12:41,421
[SPEAKER_06]: Were you that stacked?

974
01:12:41,441 --> 01:12:42,622
[SPEAKER_06]: Because that's a bit much.

975
01:12:43,362 --> 01:12:44,182
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna put it this way.

976
01:12:44,443 --> 01:12:45,703
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been a D since I was 13.

977
01:12:46,184 --> 01:12:46,744
[SPEAKER_06]: You're blessed.

978
01:12:47,044 --> 01:12:47,544
[SPEAKER_06]: It's fine.

979
01:12:47,564 --> 01:12:48,065
[SPEAKER_03]: You're blessed.

980
01:12:48,985 --> 01:12:49,725
[SPEAKER_06]: Nothing wrong with that.

981
01:12:51,746 --> 01:12:52,167
[SPEAKER_06]: Boys like that.

982
01:12:52,187 --> 01:12:52,767
[SPEAKER_06]: Some girls too.

983
01:12:53,047 --> 01:12:55,508
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, if they don't show the boy's face, then it's a date rape game.

984
01:12:57,089 --> 01:13:01,452
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know about this, because the guy is... This is a little bit of an awkward picture.

985
01:13:01,552 --> 01:13:04,293
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a fucking game.

986
01:13:04,393 --> 01:13:05,814
[SPEAKER_03]: That may not look consensual.

987
01:13:05,834 --> 01:13:06,894
[SPEAKER_07]: So, the quote South Park.

988
01:13:07,375 --> 01:13:07,695
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.

989
01:13:08,455 --> 01:13:09,536
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not okay.

990
01:13:10,277 --> 01:13:12,538
[SPEAKER_03]: It's essentially a Moi game.

991
01:13:14,100 --> 01:13:15,541
[SPEAKER_03]: Which Alan just said in chat.

992
01:13:15,561 --> 01:13:16,201
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

993
01:13:16,622 --> 01:13:19,604
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, going to the Xbox 360 this week in Japan.

994
01:13:20,124 --> 01:13:20,464
[SPEAKER_06]: Nada.

995
01:13:20,705 --> 01:13:20,965
[SPEAKER_06]: Nuttin.

996
01:13:21,225 --> 01:13:21,525
[SPEAKER_06]: Zero.

997
01:13:21,705 --> 01:13:22,006
[SPEAKER_06]: Zilch.

998
01:13:22,646 --> 01:13:28,871
[SPEAKER_06]: On the PlayStation 3, though, that same baseball game, GQL Powerful Pro Yaku 2013 from Konami.

999
01:13:28,991 --> 01:13:31,273
[SPEAKER_03]: That's an ongoing series, too.

1000
01:13:31,613 --> 01:13:36,897
[SPEAKER_06]: On the Wii U this week in Japan, Sonic Lost World, which I think came out here this week, right?

1001
01:13:37,307 --> 01:13:38,087
[SPEAKER_06]: Sonic Lost?

1002
01:13:38,248 --> 01:13:40,969
[SPEAKER_06]: Meh.

1003
01:13:42,150 --> 01:13:52,955
[SPEAKER_06]: On the Nintendo 3DS, a bunch of Sonic stuff, including the Sonic Lost World port over there, but also some little headphones and cute little stickers and all that shit on the 3DS.

1004
01:13:54,076 --> 01:13:55,817
[SPEAKER_06]: And lastly, the PSP.

1005
01:13:55,897 --> 01:14:00,219
[SPEAKER_06]: Still getting a lot of stuff right now, including that same baseball game from Konami.

1006
01:14:00,859 --> 01:14:03,561
[SPEAKER_06]: Diabolik Lovers More Blood.

1007
01:14:04,361 --> 01:14:05,541
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, that is the name of the game.

1008
01:14:05,861 --> 01:14:09,762
[SPEAKER_06]: Diablo Lick, Lovers, More, Blood.

1009
01:14:11,863 --> 01:14:16,324
[SPEAKER_06]: And it does kind of look like, oh God, it looks like Twilight as an anime video game.

1010
01:14:16,444 --> 01:14:17,585
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a visual novel.

1011
01:14:17,625 --> 01:14:17,725
[SPEAKER_06]: Nope.

1012
01:14:17,745 --> 01:14:19,485
[SPEAKER_07]: They're getting a ton of visual novel games.

1013
01:14:19,545 --> 01:14:19,925
[SPEAKER_07]: Nope.

1014
01:14:22,446 --> 01:14:23,466
[SPEAKER_06]: Nope to that one.

1015
01:14:23,626 --> 01:14:24,626
[SPEAKER_06]: Nope, N-O-P-E.

1016
01:14:24,766 --> 01:14:26,327
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, DarkSakura, how about the UK?

1017
01:14:27,475 --> 01:14:28,335
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a few things.

1018
01:14:28,915 --> 01:14:46,060
[SPEAKER_03]: On the 21st, which is already the 21st there as of right now, Eldritch on PC and Warfare on PC, on the 23rd, Alien Rage for PS3, the 24th, Dream Chamber, Just Dance Kids 2014, and Ace Attorney 5 for the 3DS.

1019
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:49,241
[SPEAKER_03]: On the 25th, God, tons of stuff.

1020
01:14:50,402 --> 01:14:58,189
[SPEAKER_03]: Batman Arkham Origins, Blackgate, Naruto Shippuden, Ultimate Ninja Storm 3, Full Burst, Rise of Venice, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and We Party U.

1021
01:15:10,788 --> 01:15:11,028
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura,

1022
01:15:28,099 --> 01:15:33,205
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, like, I would be with you there, but remember, Wii Sports, biggest game ever.

1023
01:15:34,167 --> 01:15:34,427
[SPEAKER_06]: Ever.

1024
01:15:34,827 --> 01:15:35,248
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, no.

1025
01:15:35,608 --> 01:15:37,531
[SPEAKER_07]: I have no problem with the Wii Sports.

1026
01:15:37,651 --> 01:15:38,251
[SPEAKER_07]: That's fine.

1027
01:15:38,832 --> 01:15:42,056
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm talking about having the U at the end.

1028
01:15:42,096 --> 01:15:44,319
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, do we really need new Super Mario Bros.

1029
01:15:44,579 --> 01:15:44,679
[SPEAKER_07]: U?

1030
01:15:45,280 --> 01:15:46,181
[SPEAKER_07]: Or, you know...

1031
01:15:47,382 --> 01:16:07,744
[SPEAKER_06]: anything anything kind of just what they do though the only system that didn't really do that was the GameCube I mean even with the Super Nintendo it was super everything Super Adventure Island and Super Star Wars and super you know it was super they were so much better than their previous versions I mean come on there wasn't really anything that was super that wasn't that was a pretty awesome that was a pretty super system

1032
01:16:08,284 --> 01:16:10,006
[SPEAKER_07]: You're going from 8-bit to 16-bit.

1033
01:16:10,087 --> 01:16:11,228
[SPEAKER_07]: Everything looked pretty super.

1034
01:16:11,328 --> 01:16:12,169
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Actdeft.

1035
01:16:12,189 --> 01:16:13,351
[SPEAKER_06]: And the chatroom says blank 64.

1036
01:16:14,292 --> 01:16:16,414
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything was blank 64 on the N64.

1037
01:16:16,454 --> 01:16:16,935
[SPEAKER_06]: Superman 64.

1038
01:16:18,136 --> 01:16:18,977
[SPEAKER_06]: Mario Kart 64.

1039
01:16:19,598 --> 01:16:20,459
[SPEAKER_06]: Mario 64.

1040
01:16:21,320 --> 01:16:22,341
[SPEAKER_06]: This is just what Nintendo does.

1041
01:16:22,482 --> 01:16:23,543
[SPEAKER_06]: They beat that name into you.

1042
01:16:24,366 --> 01:16:25,307
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1043
01:16:46,139 --> 01:16:49,023
[SPEAKER_06]: Actdeft says super all the things

1044
01:17:04,583 --> 01:17:06,943
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like it's pumpkin or something right now.

1045
01:17:07,023 --> 01:17:07,624
[SPEAKER_06]: So there you go.

1046
01:17:08,264 --> 01:17:09,384
[SPEAKER_06]: Live.VogNetwork.com.

1047
01:17:10,384 --> 01:17:11,364
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's get into some stories.

1048
01:17:11,664 --> 01:17:11,924
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki.

1049
01:17:12,724 --> 01:17:13,064
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1050
01:17:13,525 --> 01:17:16,865
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's talk a little bit about games with gold.

1051
01:17:16,885 --> 01:17:19,566
[SPEAKER_07]: And this was something that I was kind of meh.

1052
01:17:19,746 --> 01:17:21,366
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's only two games a month and stuff.

1053
01:17:21,386 --> 01:17:30,928
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know a lot of direct comparisons with PlayStation Plus, which, by the way, folks, if you haven't jumped on this yet, Shadow of the Colossus is available on PlayStation Plus.

1054
01:17:32,008 --> 01:17:32,748
[SPEAKER_07]: I need to jump on that.

1055
01:17:32,808 --> 01:17:33,348
[SPEAKER_07]: As is Ico.

1056
01:17:33,988 --> 01:17:35,909
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I echo as last month.

1057
01:17:36,530 --> 01:17:38,851
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's still available though.

1058
01:17:38,871 --> 01:17:40,712
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, they cycle them through every now and then.

1059
01:17:40,993 --> 01:17:42,654
[SPEAKER_07]: But Shadow of Colossus is on there now.

1060
01:17:43,094 --> 01:17:49,098
[SPEAKER_07]: And also the, what was it, the poker game from Valve is on there now.

1061
01:17:49,378 --> 01:17:51,499
[SPEAKER_07]: Or no, not Valve, Telltale Games.

1062
01:17:52,020 --> 01:17:55,282
[SPEAKER_07]: The Poker at the Inventory 2 or whatever the second one was.

1063
01:17:55,762 --> 01:17:58,064
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, I played that this week too for a little bit.

1064
01:17:58,564 --> 01:17:59,985
[SPEAKER_06]: I suck at poker, that's what I learned.

1065
01:18:01,021 --> 01:18:03,022
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so those are available.

1066
01:18:03,042 --> 01:18:06,483
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyways, this month, of course, there was Halo 3.

1067
01:18:07,623 --> 01:18:09,884
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I forget the other game that was coming out.

1068
01:18:09,964 --> 01:18:13,585
[SPEAKER_07]: But they say, though, they are going to continue on with the program.

1069
01:18:13,805 --> 01:18:16,946
[SPEAKER_07]: Originally, it was only supposed to go through the launch of the Xbox One.

1070
01:18:17,426 --> 01:18:19,307
[SPEAKER_07]: But they figured out, hey, you know what?

1071
01:18:19,327 --> 01:18:20,107
[SPEAKER_07]: People like values.

1072
01:18:20,167 --> 01:18:23,168
[SPEAKER_07]: So they are going to keep on doing two games a month.

1073
01:18:24,881 --> 01:18:28,342
[SPEAKER_07]: So far, a lot of the games I already had, but you know, okay.

1074
01:18:28,662 --> 01:18:30,863
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I mean, it's cool that they're giving these away.

1075
01:18:31,043 --> 01:18:33,143
[SPEAKER_06]: It's hard to complain about free stuff.

1076
01:18:33,223 --> 01:18:33,783
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to.

1077
01:18:34,103 --> 01:18:37,524
[SPEAKER_06]: It is a little hilarious that they're giving away Halo 3 for free.

1078
01:18:37,864 --> 01:18:41,465
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't expect them to give away Halo 4, but I mean, come on, meet me halfway here.

1079
01:18:41,545 --> 01:18:43,246
[SPEAKER_06]: Like maybe ODST or...

1080
01:18:43,926 --> 01:19:11,936
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I mean Halo Reach Yeah, or Anniversary Edition Because, you know, the games that are coming out on PlayStation, like the Shadow of the Colossus and I think that was about a year or two old and, I mean, Saints Row the Third about two years old and it was already on there, or Hell, Hitman Absolution To be fair, that is a little bit fuzzy math with Shadow of the Colossus because it is a remake of a much older game I understand, but the release of the HD version was about one or two years I'm with you, I'm with you, fair enough

1081
01:19:13,076 --> 01:19:18,058
[SPEAKER_07]: I would love to see some PlayStation 1 games on there, or Final Fantasy.

1082
01:19:18,078 --> 01:19:20,099
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they kind of stopped doing the PS1 games, didn't they?

1083
01:19:20,559 --> 01:19:21,919
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, like Final Fantasy or something.

1084
01:19:21,939 --> 01:19:29,342
[SPEAKER_06]: They gave away Tactics at one point, I think that was on PSP, but I think they might have given away one of the older Final Fantasy games too, or they all went on sale or something.

1085
01:19:30,482 --> 01:19:35,684
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, let's see, NVIDIA doing an update to what's called the GeForce Experience.

1086
01:19:35,744 --> 01:19:42,947
[SPEAKER_06]: This is that gameplay optimization software and I've never used this because I have the AMD or ATI, excuse me.

1087
01:19:42,967 --> 01:19:48,129
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I got a pop-up this morning saying that I needed to update that and I'm like, shit, I didn't even know I had it, so okay.

1088
01:19:48,849 --> 01:19:59,140
[SPEAKER_06]: But I bring this up because one of the things they're going to be adding to this is that you're going to be able to capture gameplay if you have a 600 or a 700 series card so you can edit and you can upload.

1089
01:19:59,180 --> 01:20:02,423
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, even more people now streaming their games on Twitch.

1090
01:20:02,443 --> 01:20:08,049
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, this is becoming a real huge thing, which is, you know, as somebody who really loves independent broadcasting, I mean, I do kind of love it.

1091
01:20:08,089 --> 01:20:09,631
[SPEAKER_06]: But at the same time, I'm like, wow.

1092
01:20:10,331 --> 01:20:11,791
[SPEAKER_06]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1093
01:20:35,037 --> 01:20:35,538
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

1094
01:20:35,558 --> 01:20:37,059
[SPEAKER_07]: That's basically what we have on the next-gen consoles.

1095
01:20:37,079 --> 01:20:38,380
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, what the next-gen consoles are doing.

1096
01:20:38,420 --> 01:20:39,802
[SPEAKER_06]: They're starting to catch this up a little bit.

1097
01:20:39,822 --> 01:20:42,524
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's 10 to 20 minutes and not just 10.

1098
01:20:42,824 --> 01:20:46,948
[SPEAKER_06]: I would imagine it's whatever you have available on your drive, too.

1099
01:20:47,088 --> 01:20:50,612
[SPEAKER_06]: So it varies on the card and how fast it is.

1100
01:20:51,472 --> 01:20:51,892
[SPEAKER_06]: Most likely.

1101
01:20:52,613 --> 01:20:53,113
[SPEAKER_06]: So there it is.

1102
01:20:53,233 --> 01:20:54,873
[SPEAKER_06]: Some folks are going to be checking that out.

1103
01:20:54,913 --> 01:20:59,235
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm pretty sure ATI is only a matter of time before they have a response to this in their own thing.

1104
01:20:59,775 --> 01:21:00,595
[SPEAKER_06]: If they don't already.

1105
01:21:00,875 --> 01:21:02,176
[SPEAKER_06]: And then everybody will be on Twitch.

1106
01:21:02,336 --> 01:21:02,916
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

1107
01:21:02,996 --> 01:21:03,516
[SPEAKER_07]: Watch my channel.

1108
01:21:03,576 --> 01:21:04,136
[SPEAKER_07]: No, you can't.

1109
01:21:04,456 --> 01:21:06,417
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't watch your channel because I'm streaming on my channel.

1110
01:21:06,497 --> 01:21:07,197
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1111
01:21:07,878 --> 01:21:08,578
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be that.

1112
01:21:09,578 --> 01:21:14,860
[SPEAKER_07]: Eventually there's not going to be anyone to view these channels because everyone's going to be streaming their games and clogging the internet.

1113
01:21:15,660 --> 01:21:19,142
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's all one site too, which is fascinating to me.

1114
01:21:19,182 --> 01:21:25,787
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I know there's like Ustream and a couple others, but it's really fascinating to me that like one company has such a huge share of this.

1115
01:21:25,827 --> 01:21:31,151
[SPEAKER_07]: Clearly they must be using those Microsoft Cloud Azure servers or something.

1116
01:21:32,752 --> 01:21:35,874
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, let's travel to a time when gaming was a little more simple.

1117
01:21:37,904 --> 01:21:39,005
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1118
01:22:03,826 --> 01:22:05,348
[SPEAKER_03]: Get off my lawn and play this game!

1119
01:22:21,038 --> 01:22:21,959
[SPEAKER_06]: This game was great.

1120
01:22:22,079 --> 01:22:22,800
[SPEAKER_03]: It had good music.

1121
01:22:22,820 --> 01:22:24,041
[SPEAKER_06]: Why would you suggest it as a joke?

1122
01:22:24,061 --> 01:22:24,922
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, it did have good music.

1123
01:22:25,102 --> 01:22:27,665
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just like, pick something, Dan.

1124
01:22:27,745 --> 01:22:29,547
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, I don't know Adventure Lolo.

1125
01:22:29,627 --> 01:22:30,668
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, okay.

1126
01:22:31,348 --> 01:22:31,749
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

1127
01:22:31,769 --> 01:22:32,229
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's the music.

1128
01:22:35,312 --> 01:22:36,874
[SPEAKER_06]: Even Loki's head-bobbing a little bit.

1129
01:22:36,954 --> 01:22:37,715
[SPEAKER_06]: I used to play this game.

1130
01:22:38,075 --> 01:22:39,056
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, I used to love this game.

1131
01:22:39,076 --> 01:22:40,077
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a great game.

1132
01:22:40,097 --> 01:22:40,658
[SPEAKER_06]: It is a great game.

1133
01:22:41,578 --> 01:22:49,002
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyway, in the Adventures of Lolo, basically his sweetie Lala is captured by the villain King Egger.

1134
01:22:49,442 --> 01:22:52,464
[SPEAKER_03]: So Lolo's like, bitch, you give me back my woman.

1135
01:22:52,584 --> 01:22:55,505
[SPEAKER_03]: And he marches right up to the castle and kicks the door down.

1136
01:22:56,106 --> 01:22:57,606
[SPEAKER_03]: And says, I'm not taking your shit.

1137
01:22:57,987 --> 01:23:01,308
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I don't seem to remember it going that way, but... That's my version.

1138
01:23:01,368 --> 01:23:03,730
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you read the DarkSakura version.

1139
01:23:05,169 --> 01:23:06,850
[SPEAKER_06]: And then he sets the castle on fire.

1140
01:23:07,191 --> 01:23:08,331
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1141
01:23:08,792 --> 01:23:10,973
[SPEAKER_03]: And then he and Lolo make little round babies.

1142
01:23:11,654 --> 01:23:17,578
[SPEAKER_06]: He and Lala make little... Somehow Lolo became gay in your version.

1143
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:20,861
[SPEAKER_03]: Would that be auto-gay?

1144
01:23:23,423 --> 01:23:24,684
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's how Kirby was made.

1145
01:23:24,704 --> 01:23:24,844
[SPEAKER_07]: God...

1146
01:23:31,167 --> 01:23:31,827
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to break.

1147
01:23:32,928 --> 01:23:33,448
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm done.

1148
01:23:35,470 --> 01:23:35,850
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm done.

1149
01:23:36,070 --> 01:23:38,671
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, you basically go through the stages and they get harder and harder.

1150
01:23:38,732 --> 01:23:40,733
[SPEAKER_03]: Every four rooms you get to go upwards.

1151
01:23:41,213 --> 01:23:42,954
[SPEAKER_03]: Closer to his victory.

1152
01:23:43,074 --> 01:23:44,615
[SPEAKER_03]: His sweet, sweet victory.

1153
01:23:45,716 --> 01:23:48,998
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you get stuck in a stage, you have the option of dying.

1154
01:23:49,958 --> 01:23:50,538
[SPEAKER_03]: Which was great.

1155
01:23:51,419 --> 01:23:52,460
[SPEAKER_03]: Goddammit, death.

1156
01:23:52,900 --> 01:23:54,701
[SPEAKER_03]: So you commit suicide when you're done with life.

1157
01:23:55,189 --> 01:23:59,772
[SPEAKER_06]: SSJ100 Matt in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says Lolo, the game with its own suicide button.

1158
01:24:00,112 --> 01:24:00,673
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

1159
01:24:01,413 --> 01:24:08,178
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can destroy the enemies and shoot at them and you turn them into movable eggs but if you shoot the egg it disappears.

1160
01:24:09,879 --> 01:24:20,066
[SPEAKER_03]: Now the game was produced I'm sorry, developed by HAL Laboratory and published by HAL America for the NES and it came out on April 20th the day after my birthday.

1161
01:24:21,006 --> 01:24:22,828
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember it everybody and get me stuff.

1162
01:24:23,168 --> 01:24:24,329
[SPEAKER_06]: 420, it's not hard to remember.

1163
01:24:25,209 --> 01:24:25,670
[SPEAKER_03]: Lolo 2 and Lolo 3

1164
01:24:46,918 --> 01:24:49,101
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it's just a fun little adventure game.

1165
01:24:49,161 --> 01:24:50,302
[SPEAKER_03]: It's cute, you know.

1166
01:24:50,483 --> 01:24:55,108
[SPEAKER_03]: It, it, yeah, it gets kind of frustrating, uh, uh, later on, you know.

1167
01:24:55,749 --> 01:24:58,673
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's a fun game, and it's one that's pretty much held up.

1168
01:24:59,534 --> 01:25:05,841
[SPEAKER_03]: I played probably more of Lolo 2 than the first one, or the third one, because by the third one came I was like, I don't care.

1169
01:25:06,682 --> 01:25:08,443
[SPEAKER_03]: But, uh, I always had fun with it.

1170
01:25:08,603 --> 01:25:11,645
[SPEAKER_03]: I've always loved little spatial puzzle games like that.

1171
01:25:12,145 --> 01:25:13,706
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, with little enemies running around.

1172
01:25:13,726 --> 01:25:16,408
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, like your gaming week, you've been playing like Bejeweled and Fractal.

1173
01:25:16,448 --> 01:25:18,649
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a bunch of the same type of like puzzle games.

1174
01:25:19,009 --> 01:25:20,770
[SPEAKER_03]: I fucking love Fractal, okay?

1175
01:25:21,471 --> 01:25:22,251
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no, you don't.

1176
01:25:23,192 --> 01:25:26,914
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish it was ten years later so I could do Fractal as my classic game.

1177
01:25:26,934 --> 01:25:28,875
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's like instant fucking classic.

1178
01:25:28,895 --> 01:25:29,456
[SPEAKER_03]: You have no idea.

1179
01:25:29,736 --> 01:25:31,637
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway, back to Lolo and Lala.

1180
01:25:33,922 --> 01:25:34,622
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a fun game.

1181
01:25:35,022 --> 01:25:39,825
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, like I said, Lolo 2 and Lolo 3 came out in 90 and 91 respectively.

1182
01:25:40,165 --> 01:25:46,088
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a Game Boy version that came out in 1994 that came out with the same name, Adventures of Lolo.

1183
01:25:46,169 --> 01:25:51,271
[SPEAKER_03]: In Japan, it came out as Lolo no Daibouken.

1184
01:25:52,652 --> 01:25:55,334
[SPEAKER_03]: Lolo and Lala did appear in Kirby's Dream Land, Rob.

1185
01:25:56,114 --> 01:26:04,240
[SPEAKER_03]: and in Kirby Superstar as Lololo and Lalala and in Kirby's Avalanche as Lololo and Lalala where they are antagonists.

1186
01:26:05,061 --> 01:26:11,665
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought it was funny that you were making the Kirby joke earlier but Actdeft, yeah, was bringing up that same thing in our chat room and it was making me think as well.

1187
01:26:11,705 --> 01:26:15,928
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, oh yeah, both these games were made by, both Kirby and Lolo were HAL laboratories.

1188
01:26:16,509 --> 01:26:23,594
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you think about it too, I always thought that the little blue critter in Guardian Legend was Lolo.

1189
01:26:25,077 --> 01:26:26,658
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, but it's... It's not.

1190
01:26:26,898 --> 01:26:28,399
[SPEAKER_06]: It's from that shooter game.

1191
01:26:28,459 --> 01:26:31,801
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Zan... Zan... Not Zanac.

1192
01:26:31,881 --> 01:26:33,782
[SPEAKER_06]: I keep thinking, like, Zanax.

1193
01:26:34,042 --> 01:26:34,462
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it Zanac?

1194
01:26:34,502 --> 01:26:35,023
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a drug.

1195
01:26:35,383 --> 01:26:36,243
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I think it's Zanac.

1196
01:26:36,363 --> 01:26:37,784
[SPEAKER_06]: The little lunar lander or whatever.

1197
01:26:37,844 --> 01:26:38,845
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's what I thought.

1198
01:26:39,345 --> 01:26:45,208
[SPEAKER_03]: But when I... You know, before I was familiar with Zanac, I, you know, I often thought that it was...

1199
01:26:48,482 --> 01:26:48,883
[SPEAKER_03]: Lolo.

1200
01:26:50,564 --> 01:26:56,710
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I guess having a blue puff ball with legs, you know, you can't get too far away from that.

1201
01:26:56,770 --> 01:27:02,175
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyway, according to Actdeft, they also appeared in the Kirby anime.

1202
01:27:02,416 --> 01:27:04,057
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yay.

1203
01:27:05,319 --> 01:27:06,620
[SPEAKER_03]: So are you looking it up?

1204
01:27:07,020 --> 01:27:09,643
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'm trying to remember what that little thing was called.

1205
01:27:10,370 --> 01:27:11,572
[SPEAKER_06]: and somebody in the chat room.

1206
01:27:11,612 --> 01:27:12,973
[SPEAKER_03]: What is the name of the little blue fucker?

1207
01:27:12,993 --> 01:27:14,275
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know how to spell Zanac.

1208
01:27:14,355 --> 01:27:14,776
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why.

1209
01:27:14,836 --> 01:27:17,219
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Z-A-N-A-C.

1210
01:27:18,100 --> 01:27:18,761
[SPEAKER_06]: That was the game.

1211
01:27:18,901 --> 01:27:20,102
[SPEAKER_06]: What was that little fucker called?

1212
01:27:20,950 --> 01:27:21,290
[SPEAKER_03]: Outro Outro Outro

1213
01:27:45,062 --> 01:27:45,743
[SPEAKER_06]: in North America.

1214
01:27:46,043 --> 01:27:48,505
[SPEAKER_06]: In Japan, Zanuck was published by Pony Canyon.

1215
01:27:48,705 --> 01:27:49,846
[SPEAKER_06]: But you know what this segment isn't about, Zanuck?

1216
01:27:49,866 --> 01:27:51,608
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what else Pony Canyon has done?

1217
01:27:51,888 --> 01:27:52,128
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

1218
01:27:52,469 --> 01:27:53,209
[SPEAKER_03]: Porn!

1219
01:27:57,092 --> 01:27:58,393
[SPEAKER_06]: At least they're not pink pineapple.

1220
01:27:59,194 --> 01:28:04,759
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, we're talking about the classic game of the week, Adventures of Lolo, and now we're talking about porn.

1221
01:28:05,794 --> 01:28:23,105
[SPEAKER_03]: Only here at Orange Laundry Well, I'm sure somewhere there's a Lolo-shaped vibrator or something, I don't know This is after you made Lolo gay and set the castle on fire No, auto-gay Alright, whatever He is only, no, he's self-sexual Or would it be auto-sexual?

1222
01:28:23,145 --> 01:28:23,766
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you done?

1223
01:28:25,167 --> 01:28:33,752
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to think of what the politically correct term would be now I think it's auto-sexual I'm gonna be thinking about this all during the break I just love that it's to this music

1224
01:28:36,452 --> 01:28:42,375

[SPEAKER_06]: The classic game of the week.

1233
01:28:56,882 --> 01:28:58,562
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it was Adventures of Lolo.

1234
01:28:58,822 --> 01:29:00,003
[SPEAKER_06]: But it might have been Zanac.

1235
01:29:00,763 --> 01:29:03,665
[SPEAKER_03]: So... It's always the Guardian legend every episode.

1236
01:29:06,164 --> 01:29:06,945
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, that's it.

1247
01:29:53,305 --> 01:30:04,090
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, next week that means is episode 525, which might mean something because it's a multiple of 25 and it's a palindrome, but I guess we don't really do anything to celebrate.

1248
01:30:04,110 --> 01:30:05,030
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what else to do.

1249
01:30:06,131 --> 01:30:19,846
[SPEAKER_06]: it would be the Halloween show I would say we could do like a specially themed Halloween show but we never have so why start now what would we do sit here and play Silent Hill during the show I don't know if that would be as effective so

1250
01:30:20,367 --> 01:30:47,371
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, going to our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com Some people guessing the songs we were playing during the break Now for you folks listening on the podcast Obviously you can't hear the copyrighted songs we played during break But tonight for the live participants I promised some obscure stuff Because I didn't want to just play like Mega Man and Zelda And all the stuff you guys know But I did some slightly obscure stuff tonight And for those playing at home Like if you're not in chat but you are listening live You had Terranigma, started that off

1251
01:30:47,751 --> 01:30:51,333
[SPEAKER_06]: The middle song nobody got, that's because it was from Cold Sept.

1252
01:30:51,894 --> 01:30:53,675
[SPEAKER_06]: That was that card battle game meets Monopoly.

1253
01:30:53,695 --> 01:30:57,177
[SPEAKER_07]: I should have noticed that because I remember you playing that game.

1254
01:30:57,197 --> 01:30:58,638
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm like the one guy that liked that game.

1255
01:30:59,078 --> 01:31:03,801
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the third song that we played tonight was from Intelligent Cube or IQ.

1256
01:31:03,901 --> 01:31:05,322
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember that on the PlayStation 1?

1257
01:31:05,523 --> 01:31:06,503
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.

1258
01:31:06,523 --> 01:31:07,624
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are the songs we had there.

1259
01:31:08,344 --> 01:31:09,285
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was looking at the chatroom.

1260
01:31:09,985 --> 01:31:11,205
[SPEAKER_06]: Props to Orange Wright.

1261
01:31:11,345 --> 01:31:16,127
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll say your name on air because he's the only one that knew two of the three, which is a pretty good score.

1262
01:31:16,407 --> 01:31:18,088
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't see anybody else really shout things out there.

1263
01:31:19,349 --> 01:31:19,669
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

1264
01:31:19,949 --> 01:31:26,592
[SPEAKER_06]: Also in the chatroom at live.vognetwork.com, before we get back into the news here, Akuma JP says, I have a request for Sky.

1265
01:31:27,232 --> 01:31:28,912
[SPEAKER_06]: Please do the Cookie Monster voice.

1266
01:31:29,593 --> 01:31:32,534
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm like, when did I do a Cookie Monster voice?

1267
01:31:33,014 --> 01:31:33,894
[SPEAKER_03]: You've done the Grover voice.

1268
01:31:33,934 --> 01:31:34,835
[SPEAKER_06]: I've done Grover.

1269
01:31:35,655 --> 01:31:36,115
[SPEAKER_06]: Near, far.

1270
01:31:38,036 --> 01:31:38,456
[SPEAKER_06]: Near?

1271
01:31:38,736 --> 01:31:39,337
[SPEAKER_06]: Like that whole thing.

1272
01:31:39,657 --> 01:31:42,898
[SPEAKER_06]: I've done the Grover voice, but then I'm like, what do I say is Cookie Monster?

1273
01:31:42,938 --> 01:31:44,438
[SPEAKER_06]: And Akuma JP says, I don't know.

1274
01:31:44,538 --> 01:31:45,839
[SPEAKER_06]: Porn, porn, porn.

1275
01:31:46,299 --> 01:31:48,280
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm thinking, is he thinking of that song?

1276
01:31:48,540 --> 01:31:50,261
[SPEAKER_06]: The internet is for porn.

1277
01:31:50,441 --> 01:31:51,341
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, is he thinking of that one?

1278
01:31:51,821 --> 01:31:53,042
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not really Cookie Monster.

1279
01:31:53,102 --> 01:31:56,303
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the ripoff Avenue Q style thing.

1280
01:31:56,343 --> 01:31:56,643
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1281
01:31:57,168 --> 01:31:59,050
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm still mad I missed that when it was in town.

1282
01:31:59,210 --> 01:31:59,890
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.

1283
01:31:59,910 --> 01:32:00,711
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll come back.

1284
01:32:00,751 --> 01:32:04,033
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what they have at our local theater down in Folsom right now?

1285
01:32:05,595 --> 01:32:09,478
[SPEAKER_07]: They have the stage production of Evil Dead the musical.

1286
01:32:09,678 --> 01:32:10,178
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, nice.

1287
01:32:10,198 --> 01:32:11,059
[SPEAKER_06]: With the splash zone.

1288
01:32:11,079 --> 01:32:11,279
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like,

1289
01:32:12,520 --> 01:32:14,281
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, that's awesome!

1290
01:32:39,001 --> 01:32:40,022
[SPEAKER_06]: Neither were the picture show.

1291
01:32:40,042 --> 01:32:41,263
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they're both based on the play.

1292
01:32:41,623 --> 01:32:44,786
[SPEAKER_06]: The first one was like on the Commodore 64 and Apple IIe.

1293
01:32:45,086 --> 01:32:47,047
[SPEAKER_06]: It was kind of like an adventure game where you walk around.

1294
01:32:47,067 --> 01:32:49,829
[SPEAKER_06]: I think you're trying to find like the transducer or something you can play as Brad or Janet.

1295
01:32:50,110 --> 01:32:50,810
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not good.

1296
01:32:51,291 --> 01:32:52,251
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really not good.

1297
01:32:52,351 --> 01:32:53,692
[SPEAKER_06]: Like there's a reason why most people don't remember.

1298
01:32:53,712 --> 01:32:54,133
[SPEAKER_06]: They should have...

1299
01:32:54,733 --> 01:32:57,075
[SPEAKER_06]: Telltale Games should do an adventure game based on that.

1300
01:32:57,095 --> 01:32:57,935
[SPEAKER_06]: Wouldn't that be something?

1301
01:32:57,955 --> 01:33:04,980
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, in the 90s, the late 90s, there was a revival of Rocky Horror Show in London.

1302
01:33:05,361 --> 01:33:05,541
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1303
01:33:05,621 --> 01:33:11,665
[SPEAKER_06]: And they did a CD-ROM game inspired by the 80s classic that went with that.

1304
01:33:11,785 --> 01:33:17,049
[SPEAKER_06]: And it also wasn't very good because it was inspired by the 80s classic, which in turn, not good.

1305
01:33:17,129 --> 01:33:18,130
[SPEAKER_02]: The one with the blonde Frank.

1306
01:33:18,650 --> 01:33:18,890
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1307
01:33:19,151 --> 01:33:19,391
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1308
01:33:19,631 --> 01:33:19,831
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1309
01:33:19,891 --> 01:33:22,234
[SPEAKER_06]: Because not everybody wants to look like Tim Curry necessarily.

1310
01:33:22,354 --> 01:33:30,202
[SPEAKER_03]: For the record, before I forget, coming up in a couple of weeks at my college, there's going to be another production of the Rocky Horror Show.

1311
01:33:30,442 --> 01:33:30,803
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, really?

1312
01:33:30,863 --> 01:33:31,624
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a touring production.

1313
01:33:31,704 --> 01:33:32,044
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, nice.

1314
01:33:32,204 --> 01:33:33,205
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll get the info for you.

1315
01:33:33,506 --> 01:33:34,567
[SPEAKER_03]: I sent you the hairspray one.

1316
01:33:34,587 --> 01:33:35,448
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the time.

1317
01:33:35,468 --> 01:33:37,129
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're going to time warp, now's the time to do it.

1318
01:33:37,249 --> 01:33:38,571
[SPEAKER_03]: I did also send you one for hairspray.

1319
01:33:39,011 --> 01:33:39,692
[SPEAKER_06]: I do remember seeing that.

1320
01:33:39,712 --> 01:33:40,232
[SPEAKER_03]: They're putting it on.

1321
01:33:40,412 --> 01:33:40,852
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

1322
01:33:41,253 --> 01:33:42,773
[SPEAKER_03]: I know how you love John Waters things.

1323
01:33:43,034 --> 01:33:49,158
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, I do love John Waters things, but let's be real, they're never going to do Pink Flamingos live unless it involves... That would be great!

1324
01:33:49,438 --> 01:33:52,940
[SPEAKER_06]: Unless it involves drag queens, which then anything goes, right?

1325
01:33:53,040 --> 01:33:55,061
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe we can write to Peaches Christ.

1326
01:33:55,261 --> 01:33:56,102
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, maybe.

1327
01:33:57,183 --> 01:34:00,084
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure she's done some John Waters movies.

1328
01:34:00,104 --> 01:34:05,368
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyway, this is not a show about John Waters films as badly as I wish it was sometimes.

1329
01:34:05,948 --> 01:34:07,309
[SPEAKER_06]: The Consumer Version of the Oculus Rift

1330
01:34:22,680 --> 01:34:26,802
[SPEAKER_07]: Still no firm date on that yet, but it's supposed to be out sometime next year.

1331
01:34:27,883 --> 01:34:34,287
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the other things they're looking at is maybe in the future also switching those displays that are inside of it to 4K displays.

1332
01:34:34,767 --> 01:34:37,749
[SPEAKER_07]: So that would probably look pretty realistic, especially for some PC games.

1333
01:34:39,349 --> 01:34:40,290
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's pretty exciting.

1334
01:34:43,052 --> 01:34:49,055
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, there's a brand new game from one of the designers that used to work at Harmonix.

1335
01:34:49,685 --> 01:35:16,090
[SPEAKER_07]: and it's kind of silly it's actually this indie studio called No Goblin and they have a game called Roundabout and Roundabout is basically this limo driving game where you're a chauffeur of a limo and you have to get through busy streets but the limo is always spinning and so you have to dodge traffic you do run over a lot of people to do different things like deliver kittens to orphans or you know run over the orphans on the way

1336
01:35:17,991 --> 01:35:19,091
[SPEAKER_06]: Why am I reminded of that?

1337
01:35:19,131 --> 01:35:20,112
[SPEAKER_06]: The kittens are safe.

1338
01:35:20,492 --> 01:35:22,914
[SPEAKER_06]: Why am I reminded of that No Breaks Valet game?

1339
01:35:22,974 --> 01:35:25,115
[SPEAKER_06]: It's sort of... The only thing to play on the Ouya.

1340
01:35:25,215 --> 01:35:26,616
[SPEAKER_07]: It's sort of like an evolution.

1341
01:35:27,096 --> 01:35:28,136
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, of that.

1342
01:35:28,197 --> 01:35:29,537
[SPEAKER_07]: Or a revolution, if you will.

1343
01:35:32,259 --> 01:35:32,839
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks silly.

1344
01:35:34,941 --> 01:35:54,839
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, I think that, yeah, it's due out next year Although they're taking pre-orders for it right now At $10 normally it's going to be $15 And that includes a digital art book and soundtrack And I guess it's like 70s themed as well It was set in 1977 It looks funny, so yeah Definitely check out that video if you haven't seen it yet

1345
01:35:55,659 --> 01:36:22,249
[SPEAKER_07]: and uh last but not least there's a brand new Minecraft mod and it's involved or involving quantum physics it's uh called Qcraft and allows I guess players to do different things including like um they have different blocks with quantum entanglements um I guess they're saying that uh observer dependency characteristics see this is all stuff that's over my head um

1346
01:36:23,905 --> 01:36:24,166
[SPEAKER_07]: Cool.

1347
01:36:24,446 --> 01:36:32,401
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't really know what exactly that means since I'm not really into quantum physics, but I like Minecraft mods, so let's dabble with that.

1348
01:36:33,924 --> 01:36:34,305
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

1349
01:36:35,207 --> 01:36:35,668
[SPEAKER_06]: Why not?

1350
01:36:36,755 --> 01:36:39,416
[SPEAKER_06]: Minecraft will be one of the launch games on PlayStation 4, right?

1351
01:36:39,896 --> 01:36:41,257
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that is kind of neat.

1352
01:36:41,757 --> 01:36:44,538
[SPEAKER_06]: So quantum physics in PlayStation 4, maybe?

1353
01:36:45,558 --> 01:36:45,799
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1354
01:36:46,319 --> 01:36:47,719
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go on to some other news stories.

1355
01:36:48,239 --> 01:36:53,081
[SPEAKER_06]: Pokemon X and Y I talked about earlier in the show, my first couple hours in that world.

1356
01:36:53,161 --> 01:36:58,443
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, some people already beat the game, Shane, if you're out there listening, and others.

1357
01:36:58,463 --> 01:37:00,164
[SPEAKER_06]: I think Actdeft was saying he was on the Final Four.

1358
01:37:00,184 --> 01:37:00,884
[SPEAKER_06]: Before it came out, though.

1359
01:37:01,024 --> 01:37:01,324
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.com

1360
01:37:21,494 --> 01:37:40,860
[SPEAKER_06]: 4 million copies of Pokemon X and Y it's just these games print money there they go and yeah they say by the way that Pokemon X and Y tracking ahead of Pokemon White 2 and Black 2 by more than 70% well that's because White 2 and Black 2 were obvious cash-ins this at least is a little more you know effort of a cash-in let's be real

1361
01:37:41,500 --> 01:37:42,521
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, other stuff.

1362
01:37:43,481 --> 01:37:56,208
[SPEAKER_06]: I love that they are still making DLC for LittleBigPlanet and LittleBigPlanet is getting DLC in the form of Nightmare Before Christmas because it is that time of year and lots of people love this game and it's adorable.

1363
01:37:56,288 --> 01:37:59,430
[SPEAKER_06]: The little sack boy and the Jack Skellington and the Sally outfit.

1364
01:37:59,490 --> 01:38:02,431
[SPEAKER_06]: I single-handedly want to go back and play this game for this.

1365
01:38:02,651 --> 01:38:04,192
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't even have to play LittleBigPlanet.

1366
01:38:04,212 --> 01:38:06,994
[SPEAKER_07]: You can play LittleBigPlanet Cardian and still have that stuff in there too.

1367
01:38:07,034 --> 01:38:07,474
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.

1368
01:38:07,734 --> 01:38:08,094
[SPEAKER_02]: Sack Skellington

1369
01:38:39,281 --> 01:38:40,941
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, shit.

1370
01:38:41,421 --> 01:38:41,761
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1371
01:38:42,562 --> 01:38:42,822
[SPEAKER_06]: One more.

1372
01:38:42,842 --> 01:38:43,882
[SPEAKER_03]: So what is Sally called?

1373
01:38:43,902 --> 01:38:44,322
[SPEAKER_03]: Saki?

1374
01:38:45,323 --> 01:38:47,143
[SPEAKER_06]: I closed the tab because I stopped caring.

1375
01:38:47,243 --> 01:38:48,063
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to buy it.

1376
01:38:48,524 --> 01:38:49,564
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to buy it anyway.

1377
01:38:50,104 --> 01:38:50,384
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1378
01:38:51,365 --> 01:38:51,885
[SPEAKER_06]: Calm down.

1379
01:38:52,465 --> 01:38:53,185
[SPEAKER_06]: Calm your tits.

1380
01:38:53,765 --> 01:38:54,245
[SPEAKER_06]: Calm them.

1381
01:38:55,106 --> 01:38:55,406
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1382
01:38:55,586 --> 01:38:58,747
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura is freaking out because we have another story.

1383
01:38:58,787 --> 01:39:00,988
[SPEAKER_06]: This is two weeks in a row now we're talking about ColecoVision.

1384
01:39:02,262 --> 01:39:12,206
[SPEAKER_06]: because last week we talked about that whole Kickstarter thing, and I kind of said my honest piece that I don't think they're going to make their funding, but prove me wrong.

1385
01:39:12,266 --> 01:39:12,646
[SPEAKER_06]: Please do.

1386
01:39:12,686 --> 01:39:13,346
[SPEAKER_06]: I would not be sad.

1387
01:39:13,966 --> 01:39:15,187
[SPEAKER_06]: However, we have something else.

1388
01:39:15,267 --> 01:39:15,807
[SPEAKER_06]: This is different.

1389
01:39:16,147 --> 01:39:20,429
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a different retro device that's going to bring back the ColecoVision.

1390
01:39:20,489 --> 01:39:26,631
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a retro hardware company called AtGames, and they're going to be launching these devices that are based on the ColecoVision.

1391
01:39:26,931 --> 01:39:31,033
[SPEAKER_06]: They already make Atari and Sega Genesis-based handhelds, so I'm assuming these are those –

1392
01:39:31,793 --> 01:39:36,916
[SPEAKER_06]: Shitty little plug-and-play things you see just littering one of the aisles at Target, right?

1393
01:39:37,196 --> 01:39:41,919
[SPEAKER_06]: So soon you're going to have a shitty little ColecoVision thing too, but it won't be shitty because it's ColecoVision.

1394
01:39:42,429 --> 01:39:43,690
[SPEAKER_03]: I love my Clicovision, Rob.

1395
01:39:44,671 --> 01:39:45,171
[SPEAKER_03]: Both of them.

1396
01:40:10,430 --> 01:40:11,150
[SPEAKER_06]: Under the menorah.

1397
01:40:11,530 --> 01:40:13,551
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there's a menorah on top of a Klikovision.

1398
01:40:13,571 --> 01:40:14,792
[SPEAKER_06]: Isn't that where you put the gifts?

1399
01:40:15,452 --> 01:40:17,513
[SPEAKER_06]: That's how it works, right?

1400
01:40:17,593 --> 01:40:19,353
[SPEAKER_06]: Where else are they supposed to go?

1401
01:40:19,493 --> 01:40:20,214
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no.

1402
01:40:20,514 --> 01:40:21,754
[SPEAKER_03]: You have the Hanukkah bush.

1403
01:40:21,774 --> 01:40:23,115
[SPEAKER_06]: The guilt goes in my belly.

1404
01:40:25,280 --> 01:40:25,940
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what though?

1405
01:40:26,160 --> 01:40:29,761
[SPEAKER_03]: It is kind of funny that Hanukkah is the same week that Thanksgiving is.

1406
01:40:30,682 --> 01:40:32,402
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to make sweet potato pumpkin latkes.

1407
01:40:32,562 --> 01:40:34,163
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my god, Hanukkah is that early this year?

1408
01:40:34,403 --> 01:40:34,703
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

1409
01:40:35,143 --> 01:40:38,505
[SPEAKER_03]: It's because, see they don't believe in solar calendars in Judaism.

1410
01:40:38,865 --> 01:40:41,906
[SPEAKER_03]: Back in ancient Israel, we had the moon.

1411
01:40:42,246 --> 01:40:43,667
[SPEAKER_06]: Stop complicating everything.

1412
01:40:44,027 --> 01:40:44,527
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

1413
01:40:44,627 --> 01:40:47,228
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't invent the lunar calendar.

1414
01:40:47,869 --> 01:40:49,049
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys are just high maintenance.

1415
01:40:49,209 --> 01:40:49,969
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what it really is.

1416
01:40:49,989 --> 01:40:51,010
[SPEAKER_06]: You're just high maintenance.

1417
01:40:51,937 --> 01:40:52,477
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.com

1418
01:41:16,764 --> 01:41:18,146
[SPEAKER_03]: All the damn e-mails

1419
01:41:32,743 --> 01:41:40,086
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyway, they are over 600,000 supporters to have a PC version released.

1420
01:41:40,467 --> 01:41:47,870
[SPEAKER_03]: And they have generated, as far as the sales of the game goes, like over a billion, what was it, in three days?

1421
01:41:48,090 --> 01:41:49,490
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, it's made quite a bit of money.

1422
01:41:50,871 --> 01:41:55,333
[SPEAKER_03]: So there are also sources in the industry saying that there should be a PC version out early 2014.

1423
01:41:55,393 --> 01:41:55,733
[SPEAKER_03]: There are.

1424
01:41:57,734 --> 01:41:59,755
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to say, they're already making a PC version.

1425
01:41:59,775 --> 01:42:03,175
[SPEAKER_07]: They just haven't announced it yet because why would they cannibalize the sales of the current versions?

1426
01:42:03,436 --> 01:42:08,597
[SPEAKER_03]: Because people like to jump on bandwagons, especially if they know it's going to happen.

1427
01:42:10,337 --> 01:42:13,198
[SPEAKER_06]: Who doesn't like to come back and say, I was right.

1428
01:42:13,598 --> 01:42:15,099
[SPEAKER_06]: I totally called that.

1429
01:42:15,519 --> 01:42:17,279
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys, I totally called that.

1430
01:42:17,339 --> 01:42:20,580
[SPEAKER_03]: How about all of us who said we totally called it without signing a fucking petition?

1431
01:42:20,620 --> 01:42:22,460
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to make Grand Theft Auto 6, you guys.

1432
01:42:22,520 --> 01:42:24,421
[SPEAKER_06]: I fucking called it here on OLR.

1433
01:42:26,824 --> 01:42:52,925
[SPEAKER_03]: also if you happen to pre-order Zelda A Link Between Worlds you get a musical chest it comes in a nice big box now granted this is just for the US this is buying the bundle version the 3DS XL that comes with the game it has a golden Triforce cover and A Link Between Worlds loaded on the console and

1434
01:42:53,545 --> 01:42:59,827
[SPEAKER_03]: and this was already linked from a GameStop Black Friday ad.

1435
01:43:00,667 --> 01:43:10,730
[SPEAKER_03]: So as far as any type of European release, Game actually did confirm that they're getting the musical treasure chest as a pre-order bonus.

1436
01:43:10,910 --> 01:43:14,651
[SPEAKER_03]: So all of our friends in the UK, you're not screwed this time.

1437
01:43:17,072 --> 01:43:21,313
[SPEAKER_03]: And, well, I don't know if I'm happy or sad, Rob.

1438
01:43:24,449 --> 01:43:26,430
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you're always happy to be in my presence.

1439
01:43:26,531 --> 01:43:26,971
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that.

1440
01:43:27,011 --> 01:43:27,691
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

1441
01:43:30,393 --> 01:43:40,341
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a little bit more news about the Mass Effect franchise that will have a brand new story completely unrelated to Shepard or the crew or any of them.

1442
01:43:40,981 --> 01:43:44,504
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically, Bioware wants to take it in a new direction.

1443
01:43:45,345 --> 01:43:50,629
[SPEAKER_03]: And they have said, again, doesn't necessarily relate to the Shepard events whatsoever.

1444
01:43:51,549 --> 01:43:54,731
[SPEAKER_03]: But it has to be Mass Effect Universe.

1445
01:43:54,751 --> 01:43:55,591
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not just a spin-off.

1446
01:43:55,611 --> 01:43:57,312
[SPEAKER_03]: It has to be a part of the series.

1447
01:43:58,273 --> 01:44:04,936
[SPEAKER_06]: So... But they said something similar six months ago, and we all grew to accept it then, right?

1448
01:44:05,116 --> 01:44:05,576
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1449
01:44:05,877 --> 01:44:06,137
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1450
01:44:07,217 --> 01:44:13,042
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how I feel because, you know, I used to, back in the day, I used to want a Mass Effect MMO.

1451
01:44:13,122 --> 01:44:18,926
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it would be fantastic to play in that universe, to go around and hang out on the different worlds and do stuff.

1452
01:44:18,966 --> 01:44:21,248
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe if it was something kind of...

1453
01:44:22,809 --> 01:44:27,752
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of more like that where it wasn't just all the human-centric bullshit that was, you know, Mass Effect 3.

1454
01:44:28,412 --> 01:44:30,733
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I would be completely okay with that.

1455
01:44:30,793 --> 01:44:34,655
[SPEAKER_03]: But at this point, I don't necessarily trust what Bioware is going to do.

1456
01:44:35,235 --> 01:44:37,356
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm probably still going to buy it because I'm a whore.

1457
01:44:40,758 --> 01:44:41,198
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1458
01:44:43,839 --> 01:44:44,239
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1459
01:44:44,840 --> 01:44:48,962
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm still looking forward to it because, you know, it's Mass Effect and it'll be great.

1460
01:44:49,102 --> 01:44:49,762
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I want?

1461
01:44:50,642 --> 01:44:51,543
[SPEAKER_03]: Turian's the game.

1462
01:44:52,356 --> 01:44:57,639
[SPEAKER_06]: Queen Simia is in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com and says still needs Turians and Krogan.

1463
01:44:58,579 --> 01:45:10,285
[SPEAKER_06]: Alan Alchemy says it can't be a sequel that takes place in the same universe unless it's literally thousands of years later because otherwise they'll have to pick a canon ending between the red, blue, green horse shit and that would be bad.

1464
01:45:10,685 --> 01:45:13,686
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, they did pick a canon ending for part two, didn't they?

1465
01:45:14,226 --> 01:45:16,487
[SPEAKER_06]: You wouldn't have had a three if they went with a bad ending in two.

1466
01:45:17,168 --> 01:45:18,328
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone dies!

1467
01:45:18,428 --> 01:45:19,569
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god, have you watched that?

1468
01:45:20,069 --> 01:45:20,770
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, it's great.

1469
01:45:20,790 --> 01:45:21,370
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hilarious.

1470
01:45:21,590 --> 01:45:23,212
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's sad, but it's hilarious.

1471
01:45:23,232 --> 01:45:27,155
[SPEAKER_06]: The YouTube of the Mass Effect 2 bad ending or whatever, which is the everybody dies ending.

1472
01:45:27,235 --> 01:45:28,917
[SPEAKER_06]: OMG spoilers for a four-year-old game.

1473
01:45:29,397 --> 01:45:29,878
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever.

1474
01:45:30,018 --> 01:45:31,419
[SPEAKER_06]: They have the Shepard.

1475
01:45:31,659 --> 01:45:34,361
[SPEAKER_06]: The thing that makes that video funny is they have like the ugliest Shepard possible.

1476
01:45:34,862 --> 01:45:35,682
[SPEAKER_06]: At least the one I saw.

1477
01:45:36,223 --> 01:45:40,827
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you seen the ones that have hacked it to give Shepard Garrus' skeleton?

1478
01:45:42,765 --> 01:45:43,946
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, that was creepy.

1479
01:45:43,966 --> 01:45:48,147
[SPEAKER_03]: There's another one that did that to give Jacob Garrus' skeleton and he's just got this huge mouth.

1480
01:45:48,427 --> 01:45:49,948
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so fucking weird.

1481
01:45:51,909 --> 01:45:54,470
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, Reginator asks, so no more Garrus.

1482
01:45:54,510 --> 01:45:57,191
[SPEAKER_03]: They won't Garrus all the things?

1483
01:45:57,271 --> 01:45:58,431
[SPEAKER_03]: I won't Garrus all the things.

1484
01:45:58,812 --> 01:46:00,592
[SPEAKER_03]: Does this make DarkSakura a sad panda?

1485
01:46:00,852 --> 01:46:04,774
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura's kind of getting over some of her attachment in the fandom, so...

1486
01:46:05,214 --> 01:46:15,644
[SPEAKER_03]: and also speaking of herself in the third person so at this point I would actually like a new series that has characters that I'm attached to but not like singularly attached to.

1487
01:46:15,724 --> 01:46:20,169
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like to be able to explore more options instead of having just the one freaking awesome option.

1488
01:46:22,671 --> 01:46:24,453
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry I wasn't into Lizardman.

1489
01:46:25,354 --> 01:46:27,756
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, are we ready to get to the foogle question of the week?

1490
01:46:27,936 --> 01:46:29,618
[SPEAKER_06]: I sure hope so because it's about that time.

1491
01:46:37,639 --> 01:46:41,541
[SPEAKER_06]: You take Facebook, you take Google+, you slam those words together, you get Fugle.

1492
01:46:41,641 --> 01:46:45,443
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the Fugle Question of the Week, where we ask a question of our Facebook and Google Plus communities.

1493
01:46:46,203 --> 01:46:50,105
[SPEAKER_06]: And starting on Facebook tonight with some of these answers to this question.

1494
01:46:50,866 --> 01:46:51,706
[SPEAKER_06]: Two words.

1495
01:46:52,246 --> 01:46:53,167
[SPEAKER_06]: Cookie clicker.

1496
01:46:54,047 --> 01:46:54,808
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you heard of it?

1497
01:46:55,248 --> 01:46:57,089
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you know the cookie clicker, DarkSakura?

1498
01:46:57,249 --> 01:46:57,489
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

1499
01:46:57,749 --> 01:46:59,390
[SPEAKER_06]: You click, and it gives you cookies.

1500
01:46:59,991 --> 01:47:01,334
[SPEAKER_03]: I want cookies for real.

1501
01:47:01,375 --> 01:47:03,862
[SPEAKER_06]: You hire Grandma to make cookies for you.

1502
01:47:04,163 --> 01:47:04,423
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1503
01:47:04,544 --> 01:47:05,968
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you get cookie cloners.

1504
01:47:05,988 --> 01:47:07,753
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't... La, la, la, la, don't wanna...

1505
01:47:08,379 --> 01:47:08,619
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1506
01:47:08,920 --> 01:47:14,865
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, anyhow, Cookie Clicker is a free-to-play web game that has been found to be pretty addicting for some, and it's inspired parodies.

1507
01:47:14,905 --> 01:47:20,710
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I don't know if you saw, but there's a Clicking Bad, which is it replaces Cookie Clickers with Breaking Bad references.

1508
01:47:21,010 --> 01:47:26,956
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're cooking meth, and you get, like, RVs and abandoned trailers and all this, and bathtubs.

1509
01:47:27,897 --> 01:47:31,500
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, so there's all these parodies of Cookie Clicker.

1510
01:47:32,480 --> 01:47:38,184
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you've been listening to Horde House at all, we've talked extensively about Cookie Clicker, and I'll just leave it at that.

1511
01:47:39,885 --> 01:47:48,170
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, do you have a free-to-play web game that maybe you're embarrassed or proud to admit you've spent way too much time?

1512
01:47:48,330 --> 01:47:49,150
[SPEAKER_06]: What is the game?

1513
01:47:49,290 --> 01:47:51,151
[SPEAKER_06]: And share the link with the rest of our listeners.

1514
01:47:51,211 --> 01:47:54,713
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want links to these games, check out our Facebook and our Google Plus page.

1515
01:47:55,054 --> 01:47:55,594
[SPEAKER_06]: So here we go.

1516
01:47:55,754 --> 01:47:56,915
[SPEAKER_06]: Unfolded Raptor says...

1517
01:47:57,395 --> 01:47:57,876
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

1518
01:48:13,072 --> 01:48:20,837
[SPEAKER_06]: Our good buddy from Koopa Club, Renee, says, There are a few free-to-play games I've enjoyed over the years, but the best one being The Kingdom of Loathing.

1519
01:48:21,297 --> 01:48:31,162
[SPEAKER_06]: Simple interface, much like Clicking Bad, but totally aloof and lighthearted fantasy story, especially when you can be a pasta-mancer or a saucer-roar, and it's been running for 10 years.

1520
01:48:31,503 --> 01:48:33,584
[SPEAKER_06]: Even I played The Kingdom of Loathing for a hot minute.

1521
01:48:33,924 --> 01:48:36,285
[SPEAKER_06]: I think a lot of people have checked this game out, and it's a fun one.

1522
01:48:36,325 --> 01:48:36,685
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't.

1523
01:48:37,306 --> 01:48:37,986
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you should check it out.

1524
01:48:38,006 --> 01:48:38,566
[SPEAKER_06]: I think you'd have fun.

1525
01:48:38,726 --> 01:48:38,967
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe.

1526
01:48:39,267 --> 01:48:39,487
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1527
01:48:40,187 --> 01:48:44,570
[SPEAKER_06]: Degenerate Johnny says, I'm actually proud to say that I play My Vegas Slots on Facebook.

1528
01:48:44,971 --> 01:48:54,837
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a game in which you play slot games and table games in order to earn points that can be spent on real Vegas rewards, like a drink at the Mirage or complimentary rooms at the MGM Grand.

1529
01:48:55,197 --> 01:48:55,678
[SPEAKER_06]: P.S.

1530
01:48:55,798 --> 01:48:58,680
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm at 10 million cookies on the Cookie Clicker mobile app.

1531
01:48:58,960 --> 01:48:59,760
[SPEAKER_06]: You're welcome, Rob.

1532
01:49:00,401 --> 01:49:01,522
[SPEAKER_06]: I got to 15 million.

1533
01:49:02,002 --> 01:49:02,502
[SPEAKER_06]: Suck it!

1534
01:49:03,423 --> 01:49:08,546
[SPEAKER_06]: Codeman says, well, it's a web-based and mobile game, Robot Unicorn Attack.

1535
01:49:08,726 --> 01:49:09,207
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, God.

1536
01:49:10,328 --> 01:49:10,789
[SPEAKER_06]: Love it!

1537
01:49:10,949 --> 01:49:11,289
[SPEAKER_06]: Love it!

1538
01:49:11,850 --> 01:49:19,641
[SPEAKER_06]: This game is beyond addicting, and after Robot Unicorn Attack 2 was released, they added a feature where you gain levels, unlock new abilities, and you can customize your unicorn.

1539
01:49:19,961 --> 01:49:21,964
[SPEAKER_06]: Plus online PvP matches.

1540
01:49:23,005 --> 01:49:24,748
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't know they put PvP in the game.

1541
01:49:24,968 --> 01:49:25,489
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god.

1542
01:49:25,529 --> 01:49:26,270
[SPEAKER_06]: That's awesome.

1543
01:49:26,630 --> 01:49:28,011
[SPEAKER_03]: And now that song is stuck in my head.

1544
01:49:28,232 --> 01:49:28,832
[SPEAKER_03]: Freaking erasure.

1545
01:49:29,473 --> 01:49:33,977
[SPEAKER_06]: Always I wanna be Well, in Robot Unicorn Attack 2, you can play the never-ending story.

1546
01:49:34,217 --> 01:49:36,279
[SPEAKER_06]: They have like DLC and you can do the never-ending story.

1547
01:49:36,299 --> 01:49:36,620
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

1548
01:49:36,740 --> 01:49:39,823
[SPEAKER_03]: As awesome as that sounds, it has to always be erasure every time.

1549
01:49:40,143 --> 01:49:40,584
[SPEAKER_06]: It does.

1550
01:49:41,464 --> 01:49:42,105
[SPEAKER_06]: It really does.

1551
01:49:43,827 --> 01:49:45,088
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you played Robot Unicorn Attack?

1552
01:49:47,162 --> 01:49:47,523
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

1553
01:49:48,644 --> 01:49:49,245
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course I have.

1554
01:49:49,265 --> 01:49:50,347
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1555
01:49:50,567 --> 01:49:51,348
[SPEAKER_06]: How good are you at it?

1556
01:49:52,249 --> 01:49:52,810
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty good.

1557
01:49:52,830 --> 01:49:53,191
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1558
01:49:53,211 --> 01:49:57,216
[SPEAKER_06]: I need to read the rest of the Fugle answers here to this song here.

1559
01:49:57,457 --> 01:49:57,737
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1560
01:50:04,298 --> 01:50:04,998
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

1561
01:50:19,116 --> 01:50:22,240
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1562
01:50:36,157 --> 01:50:46,671
[SPEAKER_06]: Critical Myth says, At one point there was a Spartacus clicky game on Facebook I was fairly addicted to, and I was playing a game called Equilibrium on my Vita for weeks earlier this year.

1563
01:50:48,273 --> 01:50:52,018
[SPEAKER_06]: Ragenator says, To be honest, I never got into the free-to-play web game scene.

1564
01:50:52,979 --> 01:50:55,722
[SPEAKER_06]: WONK WONK WONK WONK

1565
01:51:10,678 --> 01:51:13,500
[SPEAKER_06]: and for the longest time would have scoffed at the idea of PC gaming.

1566
01:51:13,800 --> 01:51:23,405
[SPEAKER_06]: It wasn't until the theft last year of my original laptop, my PS3 and TV that I got into PC gaming, albeit begrudgingly if only because I couldn't afford to replace my TV and PS3.

1567
01:51:23,805 --> 01:51:25,886
[SPEAKER_06]: Now I thoroughly enjoy PC gaming.

1568
01:51:26,066 --> 01:51:30,268
[SPEAKER_06]: Well Ragenator, go check out some of these links people are leaving and you can fill up your PC with crap.

1569
01:51:32,550 --> 01:51:39,223
[SPEAKER_06]: Austin S says, oh, and I'm sure we've all played this one, being music game fans we are, FFR, Flash Flash Revolution.

1570
01:51:39,623 --> 01:51:41,327
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a web-based step mania game.

1571
01:51:41,807 --> 01:51:43,851
[SPEAKER_06]: I used to play it a lot back in the day, but it's dated now.

1572
01:51:45,174 --> 01:51:45,594
[SPEAKER_06]: Fair enough.

1573
01:51:46,034 --> 01:51:48,115
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, let's go on to Google+.

1574
01:51:48,155 --> 01:51:49,376
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a couple answers there.

1575
01:51:50,176 --> 01:51:52,277
[SPEAKER_06]: Actdeft says, mostly Facebook games.

1576
01:51:52,857 --> 01:51:56,819
[SPEAKER_06]: I used to play them a lot, but I eventually got tired of them, like Songpop or even You Don't Know Jack.

1577
01:51:57,239 --> 01:52:00,461
[SPEAKER_06]: I do play the occasional Bejeweled Bluets and Tetris Friends there, though.

1578
01:52:01,321 --> 01:52:04,242
[SPEAKER_06]: And lastly, Redertainment says, yes, The Sims on Facebook.

1579
01:52:04,563 --> 01:52:09,305
[SPEAKER_06]: I never spent a cent on it and got really far in it until I got a girlfriend and started having sex in the game.

1580
01:52:10,285 --> 01:52:11,885
[SPEAKER_06]: Then I got oddly disinterested.

1581
01:52:12,145 --> 01:52:12,486
[SPEAKER_06]: Weird.

1582
01:52:13,166 --> 01:52:18,367
[SPEAKER_06]: I also started playing The Sims FreePlay on my iPad until I found out I couldn't play it at work because I wasn't connected to the internet.

1583
01:52:18,627 --> 01:52:19,427
[SPEAKER_06]: That's stupid.

1584
01:52:19,747 --> 01:52:22,748
[SPEAKER_06]: The game is downloaded on my iPad and the file size is mighty large.

1585
01:52:23,108 --> 01:52:25,208
[SPEAKER_06]: Why can't my save be on the iPad as well?

1586
01:52:26,009 --> 01:52:29,229
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess because it's harder to take your money if you're not connected to the internet.

1587
01:52:30,430 --> 01:52:30,670
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

1588
01:52:31,370 --> 01:52:32,330
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye Erasure.

1589
01:52:32,670 --> 01:52:33,210
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll miss you.

1590
01:52:34,730 --> 01:52:36,851
[SPEAKER_03]: You totally should use this every time for the segment now.

1591
01:52:37,521 --> 01:52:49,565
[SPEAKER_06]: Cookie Clicker is definitely mine.

1592
01:52:49,785 --> 01:52:50,505
[SPEAKER_06]: They have an iPhone.

1593
01:52:50,885 --> 01:52:51,945
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not official, though.

1594
01:52:52,486 --> 01:52:54,086
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a follow-up to Horde House.

1595
01:52:54,666 --> 01:52:59,148
[SPEAKER_06]: The iPhone one is Cookie Clickers, and it's a knockoff game.

1596
01:52:59,188 --> 01:53:01,008
[SPEAKER_06]: It's still pretty good, but it's not official.

1597
01:53:01,048 --> 01:53:03,509
[SPEAKER_06]: There is an official one in the making, just to say.

1598
01:53:04,665 --> 01:53:08,246
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't remember really the last free one that I did.

1599
01:53:09,307 --> 01:53:11,267
[SPEAKER_03]: Because remember when I got my iCade?

1600
01:53:12,268 --> 01:53:15,869
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of went on a purchasing spree, which I probably shouldn't have done.

1601
01:53:16,129 --> 01:53:16,910
[SPEAKER_03]: Oops.

1602
01:53:19,310 --> 01:53:22,692
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, all the ones that I actually still have on my phone are...

1603
01:53:24,833 --> 01:53:26,214
[SPEAKER_03]: are ones I paid for.

1604
01:53:26,534 --> 01:53:28,895
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I'm actually looking at my folder now.

1605
01:53:29,695 --> 01:53:29,915
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1606
01:53:31,676 --> 01:53:32,517
[SPEAKER_03]: I have Robot Unicorn.

1607
01:53:32,697 --> 01:53:33,237
[SPEAKER_03]: I played for that.

1608
01:53:33,637 --> 01:53:34,618
[SPEAKER_03]: Duke Big, I paid for that.

1609
01:53:34,718 --> 01:53:35,678
[SPEAKER_03]: Droplets, I paid for that.

1610
01:53:37,579 --> 01:53:39,020
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, everything on here I paid for.

1611
01:53:40,040 --> 01:53:41,441
[SPEAKER_03]: So, no, nothing free.

1612
01:53:41,917 --> 01:53:42,797
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, what about you?

1613
01:53:44,138 --> 01:53:56,084
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think there's really been anything that I've played for free aside from that time when I was doing the whole Ready Player One thing where I had to play that really shitty garage sale game on Facebook.

1614
01:53:56,204 --> 01:53:56,864
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, God.

1615
01:53:57,104 --> 01:53:59,185
[SPEAKER_07]: But I didn't necessarily want to play that.

1616
01:53:59,325 --> 01:53:59,885
[SPEAKER_07]: What ever happened?

1617
01:53:59,925 --> 01:54:01,766
[SPEAKER_07]: Did that guy really win that DeLorean or whatever?

1618
01:54:01,946 --> 01:54:02,487
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, he did.

1619
01:54:02,827 --> 01:54:08,629
[SPEAKER_07]: There was a guy that won the DeLorean because he got the world record in Joust, I think, on the 2600.

1620
01:54:08,669 --> 01:54:08,730
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

1621
01:54:10,632 --> 01:54:10,952
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1622
01:54:10,992 --> 01:54:11,813
[SPEAKER_06]: Grats to him, I guess.

1623
01:54:12,473 --> 01:54:12,854
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1624
01:54:13,814 --> 01:54:15,816
[SPEAKER_06]: More stories coming your way up now.

1625
01:54:15,936 --> 01:54:16,236
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki.

1626
01:54:16,876 --> 01:54:18,397
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1627
01:54:18,778 --> 01:54:19,758
[SPEAKER_07]: No DeLorean for me.

1628
01:54:19,778 --> 01:54:20,099
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

1629
01:54:20,139 --> 01:54:23,301
[SPEAKER_07]: It probably would have been more.

1630
01:54:23,401 --> 01:54:25,522
[SPEAKER_06]: You wouldn't have wanted to pay the taxes on it.

1631
01:54:25,562 --> 01:54:28,725
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, the taxes and then on top of that, servicing the thing.

1632
01:54:28,765 --> 01:54:34,068
[SPEAKER_07]: The only service center that does DeLoreans, at least around here, is in L.A.

1633
01:54:34,148 --> 01:54:36,130
[SPEAKER_07]: So that wouldn't be very convenient.

1634
01:54:36,150 --> 01:54:36,630
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1635
01:54:37,191 --> 01:54:40,234
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, okay, so let's talk a little bit about the PlayStation 4.

1636
01:54:40,654 --> 01:54:42,396
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, you want to check out a PlayStation 4?

1637
01:54:42,496 --> 01:54:49,643
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, there's going to be some demo kiosks coming soon to, uh, Sony stores, GameStop, Target, Walmart, and Best Buy.

1638
01:54:50,544 --> 01:54:55,568
[SPEAKER_07]: And, uh, they have a website that you can actually go to to see where they are at.

1639
01:54:55,769 --> 01:54:58,411
[SPEAKER_07]: If you go to, it's the experienceplaystation.com.

1640
01:54:59,752 --> 01:55:18,201
[SPEAKER_07]: and you put in your zip code and they'll show you a map with all the different stores that are you know supplying it and we have none there is absolutely none in our area so I noticed Best Buy is making a lot of room for both the PlayStation 4 and the Xbox although on the whole

1641
01:55:18,841 --> 01:55:29,306
[SPEAKER_06]: on the whole it seems like Best Buy has really scaled back their gaming sections I guess in favor of other stuff and some of the things we've been hearing about the company you know on CNN or other news sites.

1642
01:55:29,326 --> 01:55:47,534
[SPEAKER_07]: Go where the margins are bigger because gaming isn't it that's for sure I guess so so yeah and then it's a little I don't understand this to be honest and this is basically you can pre-order digital downloads of PlayStation 4 launch titles

1643
01:55:48,394 --> 01:56:10,964
[SPEAKER_07]: look if you're willing to give them your credit card they'll take it on the PlayStation 3 and guess what you get for doing that no discount so why the fuck would you do that because you want to be able to play that shit day one even though if you're gonna have to go and download it anyways or go and pick up your PlayStation 4 somewhere unless Amazon's bringing it to you

1644
01:56:11,244 --> 01:56:11,825
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's put it this way.

1645
01:56:12,185 --> 01:56:21,232
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I know you can partially download the game and then you can start playing it once you've downloaded the game, but the thing is, these downloads are fucking huge.

1646
01:56:21,252 --> 01:56:28,317
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember, we mentioned on a couple shows back they had this NBA Ultimate Fan Pack or Super Fan Pack or something like that.

1647
01:56:28,357 --> 01:56:31,560
[SPEAKER_07]: It's basically digital versions of the current gen and next gen versions of the game.

1648
01:56:31,920 --> 01:56:36,544
[SPEAKER_07]: The next gen versions of the game were like 60 gigabytes to download.

1649
01:56:37,705 --> 01:56:38,425
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, but there's...

1650
01:56:39,546 --> 01:56:40,547
[SPEAKER_07]: Why would you want to do that?

1651
01:56:40,587 --> 01:56:42,889
[SPEAKER_07]: Just go to retail and buy the game.

1652
01:56:42,929 --> 01:56:46,492
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you may have to pay taxes on it, but just go buy it.

1653
01:56:46,612 --> 01:56:48,454
[SPEAKER_07]: Or, hey, here's a wonderful idea.

1654
01:56:48,494 --> 01:56:50,996
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe wait until Black Friday and see if they discount that shit.

1655
01:56:52,217 --> 01:56:52,918
[SPEAKER_07]: Might be something.

1656
01:56:54,759 --> 01:56:59,762
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, there's just no reason I can see to pre-order a game unless you get something.

1657
01:56:59,962 --> 01:57:02,344
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, because so far they haven't really said anything.

1658
01:57:02,364 --> 01:57:15,892
[SPEAKER_07]: It says, I guess, the only game that you can pre-order that seems like you get something for is Warframe, which is free, so I don't understand that at all, but it's free and I guess you get some in-game money and exclusive weapon skins.

1659
01:57:16,152 --> 01:57:16,973
[SPEAKER_07]: So sure, why not?

1660
01:57:17,033 --> 01:57:21,395
[SPEAKER_07]: Go pre-order that if you're going to get a PlayStation 4 in case you want to play it because it's free.

1661
01:57:22,996 --> 01:57:39,166
[SPEAKER_07]: But as far as Knack and Killzone or something like that, unless they're charging me like $53.99 or some sort of discount there, I just don't see a reason to pre-order anything for a digital download.

1662
01:57:39,186 --> 01:57:39,447
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean...

1663
01:57:40,387 --> 01:57:44,889
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck, if you want to do a digital download and you decide that you want to do that, do it at launch day.

1664
01:57:44,909 --> 01:57:52,693
[SPEAKER_06]: Make that decision on launch day, not necessarily... Well, it just goes back to that old thing we were talking about way back when the Xbox One was rumored to have all these restrictions.

1665
01:57:52,713 --> 01:57:54,634
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, what's the benefit of going digital?

1666
01:57:54,754 --> 01:57:57,535
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not like they're not going to have a digital copy for you.

1667
01:57:57,595 --> 01:58:00,897
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not like they're going to sell out digital copies of a game.

1668
01:58:00,957 --> 01:58:03,338
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it just doesn't make any sense.

1669
01:58:05,306 --> 01:58:10,769
[SPEAKER_06]: They just want a really easy way for you to hit the button and they can charge the card and make another sale.

1670
01:58:10,889 --> 01:58:11,509
[SPEAKER_06]: Really easy.

1671
01:58:11,769 --> 01:58:12,790
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what this is all about.

1672
01:58:13,210 --> 01:58:13,651
[SPEAKER_06]: Nothing more.

1673
01:58:14,731 --> 01:58:16,272
[SPEAKER_06]: I think you're thinking too much about it, Loki.

1674
01:58:17,493 --> 01:58:27,319
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well, this game fell off our radar years ago and the last time we were talking about this video game, I think we were exclusively a show about music-based video games.

1675
01:58:27,759 --> 01:58:30,641
[SPEAKER_06]: This game was being developed for an arcade release in 2005.

1676
01:58:32,322 --> 01:58:35,744
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if you guys remember when we were talking about a game called Neon FM.

1677
01:58:36,144 --> 01:58:36,584
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember this?

1678
01:58:37,105 --> 01:58:43,048
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it had like freeze pop and it had some really other like kind of questionably good songs in it.

1679
01:58:43,408 --> 01:58:51,913
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's been a long time, obviously, and this game has kind of reinvented itself a little bit because Unit E is the group now that's putting this arcade cabinet out.

1680
01:58:51,973 --> 01:58:58,837
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I heard a rumor once that at one point Betson, who ended up doing the DDR cabinets years later, was going to do this game and they didn't.

1681
01:58:59,257 --> 01:59:00,798
[SPEAKER_06]: So now Unity is doing this.

1682
01:59:01,318 --> 01:59:24,218
[SPEAKER_06]: and it's no longer a dance game that's the other big change it is now a I guess to me it would strike me more as like poppin music because it's got the big circular pads that you hit yeah it was originally supposed to be played the same way except the dance pad would look like what that pad looks like right there it was like three on the bottom two on the top it wasn't like your typical DDR dance it was like beatmania with your feet yeah feetmania right

1683
01:59:25,791 --> 01:59:29,574
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, so Neon FM is apparently now like a thing.

1684
01:59:30,214 --> 01:59:31,835
[SPEAKER_06]: There's video out there.

1685
01:59:31,875 --> 01:59:33,216
[SPEAKER_06]: You can see it on YouTube and so forth.

1686
01:59:34,477 --> 01:59:36,638
[SPEAKER_06]: But is Girls Butts in it?

1687
01:59:36,998 --> 01:59:39,080
[SPEAKER_07]: And it is, because I can see that in the screenshot.

1688
01:59:39,180 --> 01:59:39,900
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently it is.

1689
01:59:40,020 --> 01:59:40,961
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently it is.

1690
01:59:41,021 --> 01:59:42,622
[SPEAKER_06]: This song is so awful.

1691
01:59:42,842 --> 01:59:46,825
[SPEAKER_03]: That song is horrible, but I think by now it probably gets the joke vote, right?

1692
01:59:47,794 --> 01:59:48,675
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's still awful.

1693
01:59:49,336 --> 01:59:53,461
[SPEAKER_06]: So apparently it is still on target for release this year to show up in arcades.

1694
01:59:54,382 --> 01:59:58,567
[SPEAKER_06]: That is if you still have an arcade near you that contains games that don't shoot out tickets.

1695
01:59:59,549 --> 02:00:00,870
[SPEAKER_06]: I will say the cabinet does look nice.

1696
02:00:00,950 --> 02:00:02,172
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope this does show up in an arcade.

1697
02:00:02,526 --> 02:00:03,187
[SPEAKER_03]: Giant Tetris Giant Tetris

1698
02:00:24,824 --> 02:00:27,765
[SPEAKER_06]: But Neon FM, no word if Neon FM will shoot out tickets.

1699
02:00:27,865 --> 02:00:28,586
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't believe it does.

1700
02:00:28,926 --> 02:00:30,506
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's all they had to do.

1701
02:00:30,646 --> 02:00:33,708
[SPEAKER_06]: If they wanted to make this game super popular, just put a little ticket dispenser in it.

1702
02:00:34,388 --> 02:00:35,969
[SPEAKER_06]: And the better you do on a song, the more tickets you get.

1703
02:00:36,589 --> 02:00:36,789
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1704
02:00:37,109 --> 02:00:40,450
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, being that it's based off Step Mania, they could probably do that.

1705
02:00:40,510 --> 02:00:43,992
[SPEAKER_06]: Or if you play that horrible girl's butt songs, it'll actually take your tickets.

1706
02:00:44,972 --> 02:00:46,192
[SPEAKER_06]: as like a penalty.

1707
02:00:47,273 --> 02:00:50,913
[SPEAKER_03]: If you play the girl's butts, then you get like kicked in the crotch.

1708
02:00:51,134 --> 02:00:51,814
[SPEAKER_03]: I would laugh.

1709
02:00:51,894 --> 02:00:52,634
[SPEAKER_03]: A boot comes out.

1710
02:00:52,994 --> 02:00:58,535
[SPEAKER_07]: I would really laugh if they had like a game like that where the tickets would go in and out depending on how well you did.

1711
02:00:58,955 --> 02:01:05,077
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess it would get all fucked up though because, you know, if you tore it off and then it goes back in.

1712
02:01:05,097 --> 02:01:10,578
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, they should be in like a glass case that you can't get into until the very end where it cuts it or something.

1713
02:01:11,258 --> 02:01:12,900
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, it should be like, look, I'm going to give you all these.

1714
02:01:13,040 --> 02:01:13,520
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm not.

1715
02:01:13,540 --> 02:01:14,341
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to give you all these.

1716
02:01:14,401 --> 02:01:14,781
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm not.

1717
02:01:14,881 --> 02:01:15,282
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

1718
02:01:15,362 --> 02:01:16,523
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you ever worked at an arcade?

1719
02:01:17,744 --> 02:01:18,625
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course not.

1720
02:01:19,266 --> 02:01:19,646
[SPEAKER_03]: I did.

1721
02:01:19,846 --> 02:01:22,148
[SPEAKER_06]: Why would I subject myself to that bullshit?

1722
02:01:22,468 --> 02:01:27,553
[SPEAKER_03]: Two of my first jobs involved arcade games, and I know for a damn fact someone would figure out how to get in there.

1723
02:01:27,873 --> 02:01:33,319
[SPEAKER_06]: My minimum wage job, I already told you, my minimum wage job was I worked at a video store and we rented porn, and that was awesome.

1724
02:01:34,920 --> 02:01:35,240
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow.

1725
02:01:35,481 --> 02:01:35,681
[SPEAKER_03]: Well...

1726
02:01:37,743 --> 02:01:38,123
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.

1727
02:01:38,624 --> 02:01:39,044
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever.

1728
02:01:39,404 --> 02:01:40,684
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, what do you have for us for the news?

1729
02:01:41,005 --> 02:01:41,865
[SPEAKER_03]: I have some shit.

1730
02:01:42,125 --> 02:01:42,305
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1731
02:01:44,366 --> 02:01:52,969
[SPEAKER_03]: Blizzard has once again changed the name of what was Blizzard All-Stars and is now Heroes of the Storm.

1732
02:01:54,109 --> 02:01:55,690
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know why the fuck they're calling it that.

1733
02:01:56,050 --> 02:01:58,511
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, they even are quoted saying, yep, we changed it again.

1734
02:01:59,391 --> 02:02:05,892
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically, they've also said, set aside whatever you think you knew about Blizzard All-Stars.

1735
02:02:06,512 --> 02:02:12,634
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's supposed to be, more about it will be revealed at BlizzCon November 8th and 9th.

1736
02:02:13,554 --> 02:02:17,295
[SPEAKER_03]: And there apparently is a trailer online, so look for it.

1737
02:02:19,250 --> 02:02:20,831
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of am like, whatever.

1738
02:02:21,091 --> 02:02:32,134
[SPEAKER_03]: Although, I have to say that the picture on here of the, um, whoever the, uh, orc is, why am I saying orc, uh, whatever the fuck they're called.

1739
02:02:32,174 --> 02:02:33,955
[SPEAKER_03]: God, I played World of Warcraft for how long?

1740
02:02:34,707 --> 02:02:36,750
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1741
02:02:50,931 --> 02:02:55,595
[SPEAKER_06]: It opens it up to a bigger audience too because they're going to have to compete against all these other MOBAs that are already out there.

1742
02:02:55,716 --> 02:03:09,909
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think it's going to be interesting because I think the Heroes of the Storm or whatever has the potential to draw in a whole new audience to this with their built-in Warcraft audience and the people that are running the Hearthstone and all this.

1743
02:03:10,289 --> 02:03:12,231
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's going to be very interesting to see how that –

1744
02:03:12,631 --> 02:03:12,731
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

1745
02:03:43,379 --> 02:03:43,880
[SPEAKER_02]: and Sucking.

1746
02:03:44,200 --> 02:03:48,682
[SPEAKER_06]: It's interesting that they're going to kind of have their own answer to League of Legends now.

1747
02:03:49,222 --> 02:03:50,703
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, can I ask you about something?

1748
02:03:50,743 --> 02:03:52,804
[SPEAKER_03]: Not to go on a Horde House tangent, but I'd love to know what you think.

1749
02:03:53,084 --> 02:03:53,344
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1750
02:03:53,604 --> 02:03:57,326
[SPEAKER_03]: What did you think about the Siege of Orgrimmar ending?

1751
02:03:59,099 --> 02:04:27,912
[SPEAKER_06]: I like that it was different if you were Alliance or Horde but here's the thing I hate to keep comparing it but I can't help myself like times have changed right like it's cool that you get a two and a half minute cinematic or whatever than when you beat the game but over in Final Fantasy 14 like that ending was seriously like 15 minutes long and it was very satisfying and it was just I don't know like it kind of just made the Warcraft endings look a little bit like oh that's all you get for putting up with all the abuse you take in LFR

1752
02:04:28,752 --> 02:04:33,093
[SPEAKER_06]: But as far as what went down story-wise, that was kind of obvious.

1753
02:04:33,913 --> 02:04:37,614
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I mean, we knew who was going down, but I was actually a little bit surprised at who took over.

1754
02:04:38,474 --> 02:04:39,115
[SPEAKER_06]: I wasn't at all.

1755
02:04:39,635 --> 02:04:45,496
[SPEAKER_03]: But I was actually a little bit more surprised with Douchebag, with Varian.

1756
02:04:46,196 --> 02:04:47,877
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was a little bit more what surprised me.

1757
02:04:47,897 --> 02:04:51,358
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I was also a little bit surprised that Jaina was so bloodthirsty in the ending, too.

1758
02:04:51,378 --> 02:04:55,099
[SPEAKER_06]: Because they're really trying to make her the Alliance answer to Sylvanas.

1759
02:04:55,519 --> 02:04:56,939
[SPEAKER_06]: They're really trying to do that.

1760
02:04:57,583 --> 02:04:58,725
[SPEAKER_03]: It just doesn't suit the character.

1761
02:04:58,765 --> 02:05:01,890
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it didn't surprise me given, you know, having your whole town blown up.

1762
02:05:02,470 --> 02:05:05,916
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the same time, it just seemed out of character for her.

1763
02:05:06,276 --> 02:05:06,517
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway.

1764
02:05:06,797 --> 02:05:07,278
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1765
02:05:07,298 --> 02:05:07,999
[SPEAKER_03]: Too much wow.

1766
02:05:08,039 --> 02:05:08,439
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no.

1767
02:05:08,499 --> 02:05:10,402
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to ask because... That's fair.

1768
02:05:10,943 --> 02:05:11,524
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a video game.

1769
02:05:11,845 --> 02:05:12,505
[SPEAKER_06]: It is a video game.

1770
02:05:12,526 --> 02:05:13,126
[SPEAKER_06]: We can talk about it.

1771
02:05:14,096 --> 02:05:18,378
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't like it, email us, mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com Stop talking about that stupid game.

1772
02:05:18,918 --> 02:05:19,718
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, Loki.

1773
02:05:21,519 --> 02:05:30,802
[SPEAKER_07]: So Ubisoft has adjusted their financials and basically have deemed Splinter Cell Blacklist and Rayman Legends underperformers.

1774
02:05:31,943 --> 02:05:40,226
[SPEAKER_07]: They said, you know, we've had games that were released for which we anticipate today lower sales than we anticipated when we first gave our targets.

1775
02:05:41,046 --> 02:05:45,271
[SPEAKER_07]: and already released games, of course, such as Splinter Cell and Rayman and others.

1776
02:05:47,433 --> 02:05:51,917
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it also probably doesn't help, too, that, as we mentioned earlier, they delayed Watch Dogs and The Crew.

1777
02:05:53,519 --> 02:05:55,100
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I don't know.

1778
02:05:55,140 --> 02:05:56,421
[SPEAKER_07]: What could they have done better?

1779
02:05:57,122 --> 02:05:57,202
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

1780
02:05:58,263 --> 02:05:59,044
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1781
02:06:15,488 --> 02:06:30,070
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know maybe it's just I know the reviews weren't that fantastic for Blacklist Rayman Legends look good but I guess a lot of people you know it would have been a better February title I think I think people saw right through what they did with Rayman Legends I think

1782
02:06:30,450 --> 02:06:43,157
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not that, like, pissing off the Nintendo fanboys had that big an impact, but I think a lot of people saw, right, the people that would tend to buy games on day one see right through the fact that it was a Wii U game that was backed into the parking spot of a 360 PlayStation 3.

1783
02:06:50,160 --> 02:07:01,049
[SPEAKER_07]: And even now, with the Wii U version coming out in September versus February, that's still a lot more months in between there and systems being sold that there's potential buyers.

1784
02:07:01,509 --> 02:07:03,110
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, they kind of had to do that.

1785
02:07:03,130 --> 02:07:04,592
[SPEAKER_07]: That was the logical way to do it.

1786
02:07:04,772 --> 02:07:13,939
[SPEAKER_06]: They should have released the Wii U game the way they'd always planned, and then they should have released the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 version later and called it a Gold Edition or an Enhanced.

1787
02:07:14,239 --> 02:07:17,602
[SPEAKER_06]: Make it feel like an Enhanced version, not a scaled-back version.

1788
02:07:18,233 --> 02:07:24,656
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe, or maybe just Nintendo wasn't giving them any money to make it exclusive, and so there was no incentive to do that.

1789
02:07:24,877 --> 02:07:28,919
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe if they threw a little bit of money their way, then they could have had another good exclusive title.

1790
02:07:29,159 --> 02:07:34,161
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think these games are necessarily damned, though, because it's going to have staying power throughout the holidays.

1791
02:07:34,621 --> 02:07:42,485
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, I said the people who will buy it on day one may be able to see right through it, but you're still going to have... It's a very family-accessible, family-friendly title.

1792
02:07:42,545 --> 02:07:44,446
[SPEAKER_06]: I think Rayman does very well.

1793
02:07:45,587 --> 02:07:47,368
[SPEAKER_06]: Parents aren't afraid to buy that for their younger kids.

1794
02:07:47,768 --> 02:07:50,609
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think that title can still tend to do well throughout the holidays.

1795
02:07:51,129 --> 02:07:51,469
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1796
02:07:51,549 --> 02:07:52,089
[SPEAKER_06]: I got to be honest.

1797
02:07:52,109 --> 02:07:59,771
[SPEAKER_06]: When I hear a story like this, I think about just a few months ago, we heard that Square Enix story about the guy getting up there saying Tomb Raider underperformed.

1798
02:08:00,131 --> 02:08:01,951
[SPEAKER_06]: And we were all sitting here going, are you high?

1799
02:08:02,371 --> 02:08:06,492
[SPEAKER_06]: Tomb Raider was like the best that they've done in that series in a very long time.

1800
02:08:06,572 --> 02:08:12,333
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a little different, you know, because with like Splinter Cell, that was the number four game of the month in August.

1801
02:08:12,373 --> 02:08:15,374
[SPEAKER_07]: They're Madden, Saints Row 4, and Disney Infinity beating it out.

1802
02:08:16,214 --> 02:08:28,105
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I mean, there's not a whole lot of other games besides those, you know, in the month, uh, versus Tomb Raider, which is like one of the top selling games of the month.

1803
02:08:28,566 --> 02:08:32,609
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it was like one or two, you know, cause Bioshock Infinite came out that same month.

1804
02:08:32,649 --> 02:08:35,251
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's hard to tell.

1805
02:08:35,271 --> 02:08:39,155
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think it outsold Bioshock Infinite, but it was definitely popular.

1806
02:08:40,016 --> 02:08:40,116
[SPEAKER_07]: Um,

1807
02:08:41,613 --> 02:09:01,636
[SPEAKER_07]: so I could see the demand there for Tomb Raider and stuff but I'm not seeing a lot of people saying oh I need copies of Splinter Cell because it's sold out Tomb Raider was like oh I need more Tomb Raider but I don't know we'll see maybe they still have Rainbow Six Patriots supposed to be coming out at some point you know and um

1808
02:09:03,590 --> 02:09:03,971
[SPEAKER_07]: Sasson's Creed

1809
02:09:18,151 --> 02:09:19,613
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for watching!

1810
02:09:37,993 --> 02:09:38,774
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1811
02:09:56,093 --> 02:09:56,933
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's the thing about the game.

1812
02:09:56,973 --> 02:09:58,794
[SPEAKER_06]: Yoshi's Cookie wasn't developed by Nintendo.

1813
02:09:58,814 --> 02:10:00,594
[SPEAKER_06]: It was developed by Bulletproof Software.

1814
02:10:00,955 --> 02:10:05,896
[SPEAKER_06]: Bulletproof made the Tetris port for the Game Boy in 1989, which was huge.

1815
02:10:06,336 --> 02:10:09,537
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's why Nintendo trusted them with the Yoshi stuff.

1816
02:10:09,957 --> 02:10:15,499
[SPEAKER_06]: But expired licenses being as they are, the game is no longer available for sale.

1817
02:10:16,219 --> 02:10:18,921
[SPEAKER_06]: This is not the first game to be delisted for similar reasons.

1818
02:10:19,481 --> 02:10:21,803
[SPEAKER_06]: Konami's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, no longer available.

1819
02:10:22,243 --> 02:10:25,625
[SPEAKER_06]: Irem did a version of R-Type that was on the Virtual Console, no longer there.

1820
02:10:25,685 --> 02:10:28,948
[SPEAKER_06]: The Donkey Kong Country Trilogy, also no longer there.

1821
02:10:29,708 --> 02:10:33,571
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you didn't get this game, I guess you'll have to go steal it from a ROM.

1822
02:10:34,471 --> 02:10:36,572
[SPEAKER_06]: Or go find it at a garage sale.

1823
02:10:36,613 --> 02:10:37,153
[SPEAKER_06]: Good luck to you.

1824
02:10:39,034 --> 02:10:40,275
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I could lend it to somebody.

1825
02:10:40,643 --> 02:10:41,683
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have the Super Nintendo version?

1826
02:10:41,703 --> 02:10:42,824
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I like the Super Nintendo version.

1827
02:10:43,044 --> 02:10:44,204
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't believe I do actually.

1828
02:10:44,324 --> 02:10:45,125
[SPEAKER_03]: I might have to check.

1829
02:10:45,225 --> 02:10:47,746
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, at this point, I don't know what I have.

1830
02:10:48,046 --> 02:10:51,307
[SPEAKER_06]: After playing the Super Nintendo version, the NES version felt kind of gimped.

1831
02:10:51,527 --> 02:10:52,988
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, as sometimes happens.

1832
02:10:53,008 --> 02:10:55,949
[SPEAKER_06]: There were a few titles like that that were on both platforms.

1833
02:10:56,589 --> 02:11:00,051
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyway, it's not like it was that good of a puzzler.

1834
02:11:00,091 --> 02:11:00,971
[SPEAKER_06]: It was just kind of fun.

1835
02:11:01,671 --> 02:11:03,332
[SPEAKER_06]: It had a good versus mode in it.

1836
02:11:04,232 --> 02:11:10,555
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, it is that time of the week where we go to the mailbag where you guys email us because every week you do email us.

1837
02:11:11,016 --> 02:11:23,483
[SPEAKER_06]: Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com Again, our email is Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com DarkSakura's going to dive into the email bag head first and pull out, oh, an email or two or seven that she feels like reading tonight.

1838
02:11:23,983 --> 02:11:24,643
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura!

1839
02:11:25,384 --> 02:11:25,704
[SPEAKER_06]: Mail!

1840
02:11:26,004 --> 02:11:27,245
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thanks.

1841
02:11:27,665 --> 02:11:31,287
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, FlaccoJones sent us an email that has a YouTube link in it.

1842
02:11:34,387 --> 02:11:47,779
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey OLR, since Mark Hamill has retired from doing the Joker voice, I wanted to know what you thought of Troy Baker taking over the role for the new Batman Arkham game.

1843
02:11:48,199 --> 02:11:51,882
[SPEAKER_03]: I had my doubts until I heard a sample reading from The Killing Joke.

1844
02:11:52,563 --> 02:11:54,184
[SPEAKER_03]: I've heard it, it's awesome.

1845
02:11:54,204 --> 02:11:57,025
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I remember hearing about this, but I didn't hear the actual voice.

1846
02:11:57,065 --> 02:11:59,327
[SPEAKER_03]: So, courtesy of Flaco Jones... Memories can be vile.

1847
02:11:59,367 --> 02:11:59,647
[SPEAKER_03]: Perfect.

1848
02:12:24,147 --> 02:12:27,751
[SPEAKER_01]: Repulsive little brutes like children, I suppose.

1849
02:12:31,476 --> 02:12:32,837
[SPEAKER_01]: But can we live without them?

1850
02:12:33,378 --> 02:12:36,582
[SPEAKER_01]: Memories are what our reason is based upon.

1851
02:12:37,343 --> 02:12:40,727
[SPEAKER_01]: If we can't face them, we deny reason itself.

1852
02:12:41,327 --> 02:12:41,648
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1853
02:12:42,629 --> 02:12:43,270
[SPEAKER_06]: He gets a pass.

1854
02:12:43,370 --> 02:12:43,730
[SPEAKER_06]: That's good.

1855
02:12:44,090 --> 02:12:44,471
[SPEAKER_06]: I like that.

1856
02:12:45,762 --> 02:12:46,523
[SPEAKER_03]: Bioshock Infinite, Saints Row

1857
02:13:04,332 --> 02:13:04,632
[SPEAKER_03]: either.

1858
02:13:05,894 --> 02:13:08,036
[SPEAKER_06]: What would you have played that he was in?

1859
02:13:08,096 --> 02:13:10,578
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm trying to think because he's done a ton of anime.

1860
02:13:11,299 --> 02:13:11,699
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on.

1861
02:13:12,480 --> 02:13:14,682
[SPEAKER_03]: Which I don't really watch dubbed anime.

1862
02:13:14,722 --> 02:13:15,522
[SPEAKER_06]: Is he 13?

1863
02:13:15,643 --> 02:13:16,043
[SPEAKER_06]: Snow?

1864
02:13:16,103 --> 02:13:17,164
[SPEAKER_06]: He was Snow in 13?

1865
02:13:17,905 --> 02:13:18,065
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh.

1866
02:13:18,405 --> 02:13:20,187
[SPEAKER_06]: Kid Icarus Uprising you mentioned you played?

1867
02:13:20,207 --> 02:13:20,667
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1868
02:13:20,727 --> 02:13:21,308
[SPEAKER_06]: He's in that.

1869
02:13:23,089 --> 02:13:23,910
[SPEAKER_06]: Metal Gear Solid.

1870
02:13:23,930 --> 02:13:25,572
[SPEAKER_06]: He was in Yu Yu Hakusho.

1871
02:13:25,612 --> 02:13:27,554
[SPEAKER_06]: He's Ocelot in 5.

1872
02:13:27,614 --> 02:13:28,615
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so he was Hawkeye.

1873
02:13:29,776 --> 02:13:30,016
[SPEAKER_06]: Hmm.

1874
02:13:30,901 --> 02:13:33,262
[SPEAKER_03]: which I have watched because of Jennifer Hale.

1875
02:13:33,582 --> 02:13:35,903
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, and he's James in Silent Hill 2.

1876
02:13:36,243 --> 02:13:37,744
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, but only in the HD version, I think.

1877
02:13:39,324 --> 02:13:41,305
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, then yeah, which I didn't play either.

1878
02:13:41,805 --> 02:13:42,405
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, well, anyhow.

1879
02:13:43,526 --> 02:13:43,926
[SPEAKER_06]: Moving on.

1880
02:13:44,426 --> 02:13:48,748
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well, no, he was Robin in Arkham City and Two-Face.

1881
02:13:49,308 --> 02:13:51,849
[SPEAKER_03]: So I knew he had been in another of the games before.

1882
02:13:52,569 --> 02:13:54,750
[SPEAKER_06]: GameGuru in chat says, wait, that wasn't Mark Hamill?

1883
02:13:54,990 --> 02:13:56,451
[SPEAKER_06]: Nope, nope, that was Troy Baker.

1884
02:13:57,171 --> 02:13:57,491
[SPEAKER_06]: Good job.

1885
02:13:58,342 --> 02:14:07,711
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, I'd have to say that's pretty good if, you know, you can actually get him confused with Mark Hamill, so... Anyway, moving on, this comes from...

1886
02:14:09,574 --> 02:14:09,954
[SPEAKER_03]: Brian.

1887
02:14:11,895 --> 02:14:14,735
[SPEAKER_03]: And I did see Shane say that he's sung with Akira Yamaoka's band.

1888
02:14:15,856 --> 02:14:16,056
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1889
02:14:16,876 --> 02:14:17,756
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, OLR.

1890
02:14:18,256 --> 02:14:21,177
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm disappointed with current gen Star Trek games.

1891
02:14:21,557 --> 02:14:23,818
[SPEAKER_03]: Star Trek Legacy was released on 360 in 06.

1892
02:14:24,218 --> 02:14:26,799
[SPEAKER_03]: It took the franchise seven more years to release a Star Trek game.

1893
02:14:27,439 --> 02:14:30,960
[SPEAKER_03]: Overall, the franchise has released low quality games for current gen consoles.

1894
02:14:31,280 --> 02:14:34,001
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you see a future for Star Trek games in the next gen consoles?

1895
02:14:34,181 --> 02:14:34,501
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks.

1896
02:14:35,641 --> 02:14:37,022
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Brian, I don't think so.

1897
02:14:37,742 --> 02:14:38,022
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean...

1898
02:14:39,062 --> 02:14:42,865
[SPEAKER_03]: If they do anything, it's going to definitely be like a movie tie-in, I think.

1899
02:14:43,465 --> 02:14:45,506
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the last movie tie-in was pretty terrible, too.

1900
02:14:45,546 --> 02:14:46,207
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the problem.

1901
02:14:46,487 --> 02:14:55,593
[SPEAKER_06]: There's nothing to make the games really on right now unless they go back and do a new Next Generation game, which would be awesome.

1902
02:14:56,773 --> 02:15:02,277
[SPEAKER_06]: They do have the Star Trek Next Generation pinball table in Pinball Arcade, just random tangent, because when I saw that, I got giddy.

1903
02:15:03,757 --> 02:15:04,417
[SPEAKER_06]: I will say this, though.

1904
02:15:04,717 --> 02:15:10,579
[SPEAKER_06]: One thing that email left out, and I don't know if that's just because this person is very console-focused, but you neglected Star Trek Online.

1905
02:15:11,359 --> 02:15:12,899
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's free to play.

1906
02:15:12,999 --> 02:15:13,720
[SPEAKER_06]: It's worth a look.

1907
02:15:13,800 --> 02:15:16,000
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think it's bad, especially if you're a Star Trek fan.

1908
02:15:16,020 --> 02:15:16,880
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's worth checking out.

1909
02:15:16,900 --> 02:15:23,402
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have to say that they did actually retool the skill system that I kind of got pissed off when they changed it the first time.

1910
02:15:24,322 --> 02:15:25,643
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a lot more manageable now.

1911
02:15:26,424 --> 02:15:35,030
[SPEAKER_03]: Space battles are still kind of, you know, you have to ease into it from beginning to Admiral for you to finally get... And they got rid of Rear Admiral as a rank, I'm just saying.

1912
02:15:36,551 --> 02:15:40,994
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was... Star Trek Online was really good.

1913
02:15:41,154 --> 02:15:41,655
[SPEAKER_03]: I liked it.

1914
02:15:41,715 --> 02:15:45,778
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, really all I did was hang out at Deep Space Nine and play Dabo.

1915
02:15:46,478 --> 02:15:47,239
[SPEAKER_03]: Dabo with Lita.

1916
02:15:48,340 --> 02:15:48,560
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

1917
02:15:50,276 --> 02:15:51,017
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's that.

1918
02:15:51,177 --> 02:16:05,573
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, but unfortunately the reality is without that stuff to tie into and the fact that the video games unfortunately have been tanking, like it doesn't look good, which pains me because I love me some Trek and I would love to see like a really good video game happen.

1919
02:16:05,614 --> 02:16:08,497
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's kind of irritating that that last one was such a stinker.

1920
02:16:09,401 --> 02:16:23,289
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, going back to Star Trek Online, I do suggest if this person has not played it to do so, because no matter which era of Star Trek you liked, and yeah, I really did not like Enterprise, but there are enough nods to the, even TOS characters show up.

1921
02:16:23,810 --> 02:16:30,534
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you actually do a time travel one and meet, you know, McCoy, and actually the model looks pretty much like he did.

1922
02:16:31,074 --> 02:16:34,196
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, it's really, really fun, I think.

1923
02:16:34,216 --> 02:16:34,456
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1924
02:16:35,077 --> 02:16:38,020
[SPEAKER_03]: If you like Star Trek, it's got enough nods that I think it would keep you interested.

1925
02:16:38,861 --> 02:16:39,061
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

1926
02:16:41,424 --> 02:16:45,148
[SPEAKER_03]: So, back to the email.

1927
02:16:45,749 --> 02:16:48,152
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a kind of long one, but not terribly long, so I'll read it.

1928
02:16:48,993 --> 02:16:50,134
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello there, OLR.

1929
02:16:50,315 --> 02:16:50,615
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.

1930
02:16:52,497 --> 02:16:54,139
[SPEAKER_06]: I always feel the need to say hi back.

1931
02:16:54,179 --> 02:16:54,740
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm friendly.

1932
02:16:55,285 --> 02:16:56,305
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you're friendly.

1933
02:16:56,386 --> 02:16:57,286
[SPEAKER_03]: You're so friendly.

1934
02:16:58,226 --> 02:17:03,809
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, last week I had a very, very unfortunate thing happen to me when looking for alternative digital distribution network.

1935
02:17:04,529 --> 02:17:10,531
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, you guys know I'm not big on DRM, so I was really happy that GamersGate.com had a selection of DRM-free titles.

1936
02:17:11,032 --> 02:17:14,093
[SPEAKER_03]: I bought a couple only to find out that the games weren't all they seemed.

1937
02:17:14,373 --> 02:17:15,153
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, who is this?

1938
02:17:15,193 --> 02:17:17,834
[SPEAKER_06]: Because they say we make some assumptions about them in advance.

1939
02:17:17,854 --> 02:17:19,295
[SPEAKER_03]: We're all still UT.

1940
02:17:19,575 --> 02:17:20,015
[SPEAKER_06]: Ah, I see.

1941
02:17:20,075 --> 02:17:20,316
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1942
02:17:21,056 --> 02:17:21,236
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1943
02:17:21,256 --> 02:17:21,396
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1944
02:17:23,613 --> 02:17:29,218
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, instead of giving me a full installer, I got very small files that pulled temporary files from the internet for installation.

1945
02:17:30,059 --> 02:17:35,644
[SPEAKER_03]: As I would find out after perusing the site, you're not able to get full proper installers, even if you keep the temp files.

1946
02:17:35,984 --> 02:17:38,507
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't install your game without an internet connection.

1947
02:17:38,567 --> 02:17:39,788
[SPEAKER_03]: Needless to say, I was angry.

1948
02:17:40,348 --> 02:17:43,891
[SPEAKER_03]: I shot off an email to GamersGate asking for a remedy for this issue.

1949
02:17:43,951 --> 02:17:49,555
[SPEAKER_03]: Only be told, point blank, they only called them DRM-free because there were no serial numbers.

1950
02:17:50,715 --> 02:17:59,602
[SPEAKER_03]: The person who emailed me back even had the gall to say that Steam and Origin weren't DRM and that theirs was an industry standard, despite my never having seen something like this before.

1951
02:18:00,062 --> 02:18:04,185
[SPEAKER_03]: For the record, the Steam versions, you do get the full games downloaded, so that is a point.

1952
02:18:05,986 --> 02:18:07,806
[SPEAKER_03]: I demanded my money back, but they refused to budge.

1953
02:18:07,826 --> 02:18:11,288
[SPEAKER_03]: So now I'm left sending you an email and hoping to steer anyone else away from there.

1954
02:18:11,348 --> 02:18:12,789
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you do have the Better Business Bureau.

1955
02:18:13,609 --> 02:18:15,030
[SPEAKER_03]: You can file an official complaint.

1956
02:18:15,210 --> 02:18:17,891
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially if you feel like what you got wasn't what was advertised.

1957
02:18:18,011 --> 02:18:21,152
[SPEAKER_06]: I think, you know, you do have a legit basis for a complaint there.

1958
02:18:21,372 --> 02:18:21,733
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

1959
02:18:21,773 --> 02:18:25,374
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially since you messaged them first to remedy it.

1960
02:18:25,794 --> 02:18:27,075
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you have to have taken that step.

1961
02:18:27,443 --> 02:18:28,344
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm going to be real.

1962
02:18:28,844 --> 02:18:32,886
[SPEAKER_06]: This is Orange Lounge Radio, not a TV network or something.

1963
02:18:34,087 --> 02:18:35,427
[SPEAKER_06]: We're a small group here.

1964
02:18:35,547 --> 02:18:36,568
[SPEAKER_06]: We love our audience.

1965
02:18:36,588 --> 02:18:38,169
[SPEAKER_06]: We love the small following that we have.

1966
02:18:38,269 --> 02:18:47,074
[SPEAKER_06]: But this wouldn't really make waves the way that I think you really want this company to own up to what they're selling.

1967
02:18:48,074 --> 02:18:49,895
[SPEAKER_06]: But I appreciate the heads up, nonetheless.

1968
02:18:50,495 --> 02:18:52,875
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously, I don't care what your attitude is towards DRM.

1969
02:18:53,275 --> 02:18:57,296
[SPEAKER_03]: It's unacceptable for a company to say that something is DRM-free when it really isn't.

1970
02:18:58,317 --> 02:19:04,138
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the most disgusting, dishonest thing I have ever experienced, and I wholeheartedly recommend people stay the hell away from gamersgate.com.

1971
02:19:04,598 --> 02:19:07,099
[SPEAKER_03]: After all, if they're lying about this, what else are they lying about?

1972
02:19:07,879 --> 02:19:09,659
[SPEAKER_03]: However, this is not a tale of total loss.

1973
02:19:09,719 --> 02:19:13,340
[SPEAKER_03]: I emailed Robert Boyd of Zboyd Games and told him what happened.

1974
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:18,841
[SPEAKER_03]: He immediately sent me a desk or a copy of the game that I had bought, and they were actually DRM-free.

1975
02:19:19,181 --> 02:19:22,242
[SPEAKER_03]: Moral of the story, avoid Gamersgate and thumbs up to Zboyd.

1976
02:19:22,882 --> 02:19:24,703
[SPEAKER_03]: Still waiting on a response from Valusoft, though.

1977
02:19:24,943 --> 02:19:25,723
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's my story.

1978
02:19:25,803 --> 02:19:27,523
[SPEAKER_03]: Hope I've steered a few people away from Gamersgate.

1979
02:19:27,563 --> 02:19:29,644
[SPEAKER_03]: If I've helped someone, the money I lost was worth it.

1980
02:19:29,924 --> 02:19:30,824
[SPEAKER_03]: Sincerely, Ross Till, UT.

1981
02:19:31,124 --> 02:19:33,185
[SPEAKER_06]: Kind of interesting way he went about doing it.

1982
02:19:33,225 --> 02:19:37,787
[SPEAKER_06]: The second half of that email where he says, I emailed the people that made the game and said, did you know this?

1983
02:19:38,807 --> 02:19:42,748
[SPEAKER_06]: But what's interesting to me is that he kind of breezed by the fact that he got the Desura code.

1984
02:19:42,868 --> 02:19:44,089
[SPEAKER_06]: So why not?

1985
02:19:44,249 --> 02:19:46,010
[SPEAKER_06]: Is Desura now your option of choice?

1986
02:19:46,030 --> 02:19:48,911
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I know a lot of people are using Desura as a Steam alternative.

1987
02:19:48,931 --> 02:19:53,252
[SPEAKER_06]: And even I've used it because one of our listeners was kind enough to gift me a game, but it was on Desura.

1988
02:19:53,552 --> 02:19:55,013
[SPEAKER_06]: So I've used it and it's fine.

1989
02:19:55,513 --> 02:20:00,095
[SPEAKER_06]: So is Desura like your happy alternative now that you found?

1990
02:20:00,155 --> 02:20:00,355
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't...

1991
02:20:00,775 --> 02:20:02,337
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if I really heard that part of it.

1992
02:20:02,657 --> 02:20:11,165
[SPEAKER_06]: But I will say this in the email, in our chat room, live.vognetwork.com, Actdeft says, Gamersgate is a mess of a site.

1993
02:20:11,465 --> 02:20:12,506
[SPEAKER_06]: I try not to buy from them.

1994
02:20:12,586 --> 02:20:14,188
[SPEAKER_06]: So apparently, I've never heard of this site.

1995
02:20:14,308 --> 02:20:15,089
[SPEAKER_06]: I have no opinion.

1996
02:20:15,549 --> 02:20:16,890
[SPEAKER_06]: I can only go off what the listeners say.

1997
02:20:17,151 --> 02:20:20,574
[SPEAKER_03]: And Ranma says to file a chargeback on your credit card.

1998
02:20:21,445 --> 02:20:24,847
[SPEAKER_06]: Usually you want to do that as a last resort because that can come back to bite you.

1999
02:20:25,007 --> 02:20:26,568
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say Better Business Bureau first.

2000
02:20:26,608 --> 02:20:27,168
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

2001
02:20:28,109 --> 02:20:34,313
[SPEAKER_03]: I do believe if I heard right, if you've done a chargeback, then the company themselves may actually file with a collection.

2002
02:20:34,633 --> 02:20:34,913
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

2003
02:20:35,033 --> 02:20:36,354
[SPEAKER_03]: Which shows up on your credit report.

2004
02:20:36,474 --> 02:20:36,674
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

2005
02:20:36,694 --> 02:20:37,875
[SPEAKER_06]: You've got to be careful with that stuff.

2006
02:20:38,035 --> 02:20:38,255
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

2007
02:20:39,216 --> 02:20:44,459
[SPEAKER_06]: But no, I'd say... You don't want to burn your chargebacks because obviously the bank is going to take issue if you keep doing it.

2008
02:20:44,839 --> 02:20:47,320
[SPEAKER_06]: I wouldn't want to burn it on something like this.

2009
02:20:47,560 --> 02:20:49,782
[SPEAKER_06]: Use a chargeback when you really want to fuck somebody over.

2010
02:20:50,760 --> 02:20:57,127
[SPEAKER_03]: My suggestion is have copies of all of the emails you've sent plus the responses dated.

2011
02:20:57,528 --> 02:21:01,912
[SPEAKER_03]: Make sure they're date stamped and use those with your filing to the Better Business Bureau.

2012
02:21:01,932 --> 02:21:03,354
[SPEAKER_03]: You know I got a free hamburger doing that once?

2013
02:21:06,311 --> 02:21:07,712
[SPEAKER_06]: I got a free meal from this place.

2014
02:21:07,732 --> 02:21:09,653
[SPEAKER_06]: And they didn't give you fries, the cheap bastards?

2015
02:21:09,753 --> 02:21:10,054
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no.

2016
02:21:10,094 --> 02:21:11,315
[SPEAKER_03]: I got sweet potato fries.

2017
02:21:11,335 --> 02:21:11,895
[SPEAKER_03]: I got a whole meal.

2018
02:21:12,175 --> 02:21:12,415
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.

2019
02:21:12,916 --> 02:21:16,798
[SPEAKER_03]: And they actually... We actually got to see them make the meal.

2020
02:21:17,479 --> 02:21:19,080
[SPEAKER_03]: A free voucher for a meal for two.

2021
02:21:19,780 --> 02:21:23,603
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I complained about the Strata place that's on Watt Avenue.

2022
02:21:24,664 --> 02:21:27,206
[SPEAKER_03]: I used to work next door to them, so... Oh, I don't even know that place at all.

2023
02:21:27,226 --> 02:21:29,527
[SPEAKER_03]: It's attached to like a Days Inn or something, but... Oh.

2024
02:21:30,468 --> 02:21:32,669
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's a nice restaurant attached to a crappy hotel.

2025
02:21:32,870 --> 02:21:33,070
[SPEAKER_06]: Huh.

2026
02:21:33,590 --> 02:21:38,973
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway, yeah, I can say for a fact that I've actually gotten something out of filing Better Business Bureau complaints, so.

2027
02:21:39,633 --> 02:21:40,974
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was a pretty damn good hamburger, too.

2028
02:21:43,054 --> 02:21:44,515
[SPEAKER_06]: That is a tasty burger.

2029
02:21:44,555 --> 02:21:46,296
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe Gamersgate will send you a hamburger.

2030
02:21:48,777 --> 02:21:50,358
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll cross our fingers and our toes.

2031
02:21:51,038 --> 02:21:52,358
[SPEAKER_03]: and then share with us.

2032
02:21:52,578 --> 02:21:52,798
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

2033
02:21:54,599 --> 02:21:55,419
[SPEAKER_03]: Last email, okay.

2034
02:21:55,819 --> 02:21:56,459
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, OLR.

2035
02:21:56,519 --> 02:21:57,400
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Reginator.

2036
02:21:58,000 --> 02:21:58,240
[SPEAKER_03]: Again.

2037
02:21:59,220 --> 02:22:01,400
[SPEAKER_03]: I just had a question about computer OSs.

2038
02:22:01,781 --> 02:22:03,281
[SPEAKER_03]: Currently, I'm on my laptop.

2039
02:22:03,881 --> 02:22:08,122
[SPEAKER_03]: No, currently on my laptop, I have Windows 7 Home Premium installed, which overall I'm happy with.

2040
02:22:08,662 --> 02:22:11,743
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, the trouble is I am a supporter of Zune Xbox Video.

2041
02:22:11,803 --> 02:22:19,345
[SPEAKER_03]: In order for me to continue buying content for it, either I have to replace my 360 that I sold off two years ago or upgrade to Windows 8.

2042
02:22:20,305 --> 02:22:24,446
[SPEAKER_03]: Now the question is, is it possible to finagle things so I can keep Windows 7 and use Windows 8?

2043
02:22:24,606 --> 02:22:28,107
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, like put Windows 8 on a USB drive or something?

2044
02:22:28,487 --> 02:22:29,327
[SPEAKER_03]: How would I do that?

2045
02:22:29,687 --> 02:22:35,168
[SPEAKER_03]: I never once did anything on a computer regarding an OS and I hate to either brick my PC, lose Windows 7, etc.

2046
02:22:35,288 --> 02:22:36,048
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks in advance.

2047
02:22:37,188 --> 02:22:46,450
[SPEAKER_03]: I will tell you this, that Windows OS in both cases are very extraneous with the other stuff that they install with it.

2048
02:22:47,671 --> 02:22:49,851
[SPEAKER_03]: Depending on how big your hard drive is, you could probably partition

2049
02:22:51,075 --> 02:22:57,678
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's probably going to have to be the way you do it because you can dual boot your system, but I don't know why you'd really want to do that.

2050
02:22:57,738 --> 02:22:59,358
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to go to Windows 8, then just go to Windows 8.

2051
02:23:00,139 --> 02:23:03,940
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, if you need to see the new movies, which I think is kind of a dick move on Microsoft's part.

2052
02:23:04,040 --> 02:23:10,583
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to go to Windows 8, but I know that when I rebuild my computer, I'm basically going to put Windows 7 on it no matter what it comes with.

2053
02:23:11,743 --> 02:23:40,673
[SPEAKER_07]: well don't forget 8.1 is out now I haven't used that myself there's stuff that make it like a lot more usable like you know so it's more like 7 and Windows 8 overall is more stable than Windows 7 it's just all the crap that they throw in the front there that you have to dig through and stuff's kind of moved around see at this point I'm ready just to go back to Linux Mint and Runwine for my other programs I mean they've now got most of the game drivers and everything compatible with Linux

2054
02:23:41,013 --> 02:23:44,835
[SPEAKER_06]: Comments from our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com Ranma says, you don't need to upgrade to 8.

2055
02:23:45,536 --> 02:23:48,117
[SPEAKER_06]: SGO100Matt says, dual boot if you want, but there's no need for 8.

2056
02:23:48,978 --> 02:23:50,699
[SPEAKER_06]: Brad from PodCulture says, just go to 8.

2057
02:23:51,099 --> 02:23:52,700
[SPEAKER_06]: It runs everything from 7 just fine.

2058
02:23:53,060 --> 02:23:57,723
[SPEAKER_06]: And then Bobby Blackwolf says, this is a tech support question, not a podcast email question.

2059
02:23:58,123 --> 02:24:00,425
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'm wondering, because he said the USB boot thing.

2060
02:24:00,445 --> 02:24:04,207
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm wondering if he didn't think of that, because we were talking about it with Linux a couple weeks ago.

2061
02:24:05,408 --> 02:24:07,969
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know that Windows 8 will live boot.

2062
02:24:08,049 --> 02:24:10,071
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't do a Windows boot like that, I'm pretty sure, yeah.

2063
02:24:10,991 --> 02:24:19,899
[SPEAKER_03]: Although I have done a USB installer for Windows for... Fuck, what was it called?

2064
02:24:19,919 --> 02:24:20,220
[SPEAKER_03]: Netbook.

2065
02:24:21,201 --> 02:24:23,643
[SPEAKER_03]: I have made an installer, so I don't know.

2066
02:24:24,534 --> 02:24:25,255
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that it for emails?

2067
02:24:25,475 --> 02:24:26,175
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's it.

2068
02:24:26,195 --> 02:24:26,455
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

2069
02:24:26,495 --> 02:24:27,976
[SPEAKER_06]: Give DarkSakura more work next week.

2070
02:24:28,096 --> 02:24:31,278
[SPEAKER_06]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com Send me a Ricola.

2071
02:24:31,398 --> 02:24:32,339
[SPEAKER_06]: We need like essays.

2072
02:24:32,979 --> 02:24:33,600
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

2073
02:24:34,060 --> 02:24:34,780
[SPEAKER_06]: Ross, steal you tea.

2074
02:24:34,800 --> 02:24:35,661
[SPEAKER_06]: I want five emails.

2075
02:24:35,721 --> 02:24:36,542
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

2076
02:24:36,562 --> 02:24:36,942
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm kidding.

2077
02:24:36,962 --> 02:24:37,302
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm kidding.

2078
02:24:37,942 --> 02:24:38,283
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

2079
02:24:38,443 --> 02:24:39,463
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I want one.

2080
02:24:39,744 --> 02:24:40,024
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

2081
02:24:40,184 --> 02:24:40,544
[SPEAKER_03]: One.

2082
02:24:40,704 --> 02:24:41,565
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's get to the FUs.

2083
02:24:41,665 --> 02:24:42,205
[SPEAKER_03]: Short one.

2084
02:24:42,745 --> 02:24:44,667
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's get to the FUs of the week.

2085
02:24:45,087 --> 02:24:45,867
[SPEAKER_03]: FU to emails.

2086
02:24:46,988 --> 02:24:47,168
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

2087
02:25:02,301 --> 02:25:04,022
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's the part of the show where we get angsty.

2088
02:25:04,143 --> 02:25:04,503
[SPEAKER_06]: Why?

2089
02:25:04,743 --> 02:25:05,444
[SPEAKER_06]: Because we can.

2090
02:25:07,205 --> 02:25:10,488
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, F you to all the people who are driving 10 miles under the speed limit.

2091
02:25:10,528 --> 02:25:12,990
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, it was like 5 fucking people driving 30 in a 40.

2092
02:25:13,030 --> 02:25:15,992
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, really people?

2093
02:25:16,212 --> 02:25:18,854
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't you know what a speed limit is and how to, you know, use it?

2094
02:25:18,995 --> 02:25:20,196
[SPEAKER_03]: Flow of traffic, hello.

2095
02:25:20,856 --> 02:25:21,677
[SPEAKER_03]: And the, um...

2096
02:25:23,325 --> 02:25:24,166
[SPEAKER_03]: and DarkSakura.com

2097
02:25:45,237 --> 02:25:46,938
[SPEAKER_06]: How do you de-escalate a customer?

2098
02:25:47,238 --> 02:25:48,078
[SPEAKER_03]: De-escalate a customer?

2099
02:25:48,318 --> 02:25:50,299
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if they're yelling and cursing at me, I give them a timeout.

2100
02:25:51,319 --> 02:25:51,719
[SPEAKER_03]: It works.

2101
02:25:51,899 --> 02:25:52,279
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously.

2102
02:25:52,519 --> 02:25:53,700
[SPEAKER_03]: We weren't allowed to hang up on people.

2103
02:25:54,680 --> 02:25:58,221
[SPEAKER_03]: So if it was like, I want my payoff!

2104
02:25:58,261 --> 02:26:00,201
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd be like, no, I'm sorry.

2105
02:26:00,401 --> 02:26:08,784
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to have this conversation like civil adults, so I'm going to put you on hold for two minutes, let you calm down a little bit so we can come back and discuss this like adults.

2106
02:26:10,834 --> 02:26:11,174
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

2107
02:26:11,194 --> 02:26:13,316
[SPEAKER_03]: They'd either hang up on me or they would come back and be nice.

2108
02:26:16,538 --> 02:26:17,499
[SPEAKER_06]: That'll get you a job.

2109
02:26:18,580 --> 02:26:19,020
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

2110
02:26:19,160 --> 02:26:19,701
[SPEAKER_03]: It works.

2111
02:26:20,922 --> 02:26:25,485
[SPEAKER_03]: And the thing is, they can't complain about it because I did nothing uncivil.

2112
02:26:26,746 --> 02:26:27,827
[SPEAKER_06]: She's got great attendance.

2113
02:26:27,867 --> 02:26:29,608
[SPEAKER_06]: She's shown up to most of these shows.

2114
02:26:30,269 --> 02:26:31,630
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless I was, like, dead sick.

2115
02:26:31,650 --> 02:26:32,130
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I know it.

2116
02:26:32,768 --> 02:26:34,290
[SPEAKER_03]: I even came here sick a few times.

2117
02:26:34,510 --> 02:26:35,031
[SPEAKER_03]: Watch it.

2118
02:26:35,331 --> 02:26:36,012
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, Loki.

2119
02:26:37,354 --> 02:26:42,219
[SPEAKER_07]: F you to Wingstop because why does it take 30 minutes for you to make wings for us?

2120
02:26:42,900 --> 02:26:44,722
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, 30 minutes?

2121
02:26:45,423 --> 02:26:45,824
[SPEAKER_07]: Seriously?

2122
02:26:46,144 --> 02:26:48,467
[SPEAKER_07]: You fry the wings, you dip them in sauce.

2123
02:26:48,927 --> 02:26:49,288
[SPEAKER_07]: Done.

2124
02:26:49,568 --> 02:26:50,749
[SPEAKER_07]: Wastop is fucking good though.

2125
02:26:51,210 --> 02:26:51,870
[SPEAKER_07]: They're not that great.

2126
02:26:51,890 --> 02:26:54,112
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not an endorsement.

2127
02:26:54,473 --> 02:26:56,915
[SPEAKER_06]: If I want food that will make me fat, that's what I want.

2128
02:26:56,935 --> 02:27:08,205
[SPEAKER_07]: Because if I can go to KFC and get the wings dipped in sauce within the time that I order in the drive-thru and pull up to the window, it should not take 30 fucking minutes to cook wings.

2129
02:27:09,586 --> 02:27:10,167
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.

2130
02:27:11,808 --> 02:27:13,210
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't fry wings for 30 minutes.

2131
02:27:15,126 --> 02:27:16,607
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, and their fries fucking sucked.

2132
02:27:16,687 --> 02:27:19,669
[SPEAKER_07]: They were soggy, stale, unsalted.

2133
02:27:20,029 --> 02:27:27,813
[SPEAKER_07]: It was just like some crapped potato into a little cardboard tray and tried to pass it off as french fries.

2134
02:27:27,893 --> 02:27:29,234
[SPEAKER_06]: It was just not good.

2135
02:27:29,594 --> 02:27:33,156
[SPEAKER_06]: Ranma in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com suggesting buffalo wild wings.

2136
02:27:33,556 --> 02:27:35,377
[SPEAKER_06]: Here we go, the food show again.

2137
02:27:35,437 --> 02:27:36,797
[SPEAKER_07]: Orange Lounge Foodio.

2138
02:27:37,177 --> 02:27:38,497
[SPEAKER_07]: Nelly wanted to try Wingstop.

2139
02:27:38,658 --> 02:27:40,638
[SPEAKER_07]: Even though I've been there and said, listen, it sucks.

2140
02:27:40,938 --> 02:27:42,299
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, we shouldn't go back.

2141
02:27:42,319 --> 02:27:43,499
[SPEAKER_07]: Take her to Hooters next time.

2142
02:27:43,539 --> 02:27:48,200
[SPEAKER_07]: Although I did get to try for the first time actually going inside and doing one of those Coke freestyle machines.

2143
02:27:48,300 --> 02:27:50,721
[SPEAKER_07]: Those are pretty awesome.

2144
02:27:50,961 --> 02:27:52,402
[SPEAKER_07]: She says, we should go in these for our home.

2145
02:27:52,422 --> 02:27:53,302
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, yes, we should.

2146
02:27:54,663 --> 02:27:55,903
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a project you should work on.

2147
02:27:56,144 --> 02:27:56,764
[SPEAKER_06]: Building your own.

2148
02:27:57,384 --> 02:27:58,805
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, that's expensive.

2149
02:27:59,286 --> 02:28:00,627
[SPEAKER_06]: Dispense the Tehrani syrup.

2150
02:28:00,687 --> 02:28:01,127
[SPEAKER_06]: Think about it.

2151
02:28:02,248 --> 02:28:03,028
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's your turn in Loki.

2152
02:28:03,048 --> 02:28:08,532
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to give an FU to iMessage because we all know they're already having some type of bug.

2153
02:28:08,992 --> 02:28:12,334
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've been trying to text message during the show and I think iMessage has stopped working.

2154
02:28:12,875 --> 02:28:14,036
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't know what the hell is going on.

2155
02:28:14,056 --> 02:28:16,177
[SPEAKER_06]: But then one of my other friends sent me a text and I got it fine.

2156
02:28:17,297 --> 02:28:18,817
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm afraid I can't let you do that.

2157
02:28:18,837 --> 02:28:21,118
[SPEAKER_06]: iMessage is my FU of the week.

2158
02:28:21,998 --> 02:28:27,039
[SPEAKER_06]: And yes, I'm an Apple sheep and I have an iPhone, but I just want to text message people, okay?

2159
02:28:28,199 --> 02:28:29,719
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't text message break up.

2160
02:28:30,099 --> 02:28:30,319
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

2161
02:28:32,840 --> 02:28:34,620
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you just quote a Kelly song over there?

2162
02:28:34,640 --> 02:28:34,920
[SPEAKER_06]: I did.

2163
02:28:35,420 --> 02:28:35,800
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

2164
02:28:37,041 --> 02:28:41,041
[SPEAKER_06]: Just a couple more stories and then Twitter topics and the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

2165
02:28:41,061 --> 02:28:41,441
[SPEAKER_06]: First, Loki.

2166
02:28:44,762 --> 02:28:51,347
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, so there's a new Kickstarter for a new augmented reality glass thing.

2167
02:28:51,888 --> 02:28:54,070
[SPEAKER_07]: It's done by some ex-Valve employees.

2168
02:28:56,352 --> 02:28:58,854
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess they've reached their goal already, but they're doing their stretch goals.

2169
02:28:59,314 --> 02:29:10,143
[SPEAKER_07]: What's kind of unique about it is it's these shutter glasses, and they actually have projectors, so it projects 3D images onto the environment.

2170
02:29:10,583 --> 02:29:24,042
[SPEAKER_07]: The only thing, though, that seemed kind of weird, though, is, like, in the video and stuff, it just didn't seem like, I mean, if you're moving your head and stuff, wouldn't that projector, you know, the projection kind of change where it's at, unless it's updating really fast?

2171
02:29:24,683 --> 02:29:24,963
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

2172
02:29:26,403 --> 02:29:26,663
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

2173
02:29:26,823 --> 02:29:27,264
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting.

2174
02:29:27,464 --> 02:29:29,046
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't know what the price point of it is.

2175
02:29:30,387 --> 02:29:34,210
[SPEAKER_07]: Certainly I'm not going to back it because I don't need to spend money on this kind of crap.

2176
02:29:35,251 --> 02:29:36,272
[SPEAKER_07]: But you kind of want to.

2177
02:29:37,513 --> 02:29:40,316
[SPEAKER_07]: No, because it's not expected to come out for like a year.

2178
02:29:41,157 --> 02:29:42,198
[SPEAKER_07]: A starter package is $189.

2179
02:29:42,618 --> 02:29:46,021
[SPEAKER_07]: And you get a cast AR.

2180
02:29:46,301 --> 02:29:47,403
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that's the weird thing about it.

2181
02:29:47,523 --> 02:29:49,905
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to have this thing that it actually casts onto.

2182
02:29:49,925 --> 02:29:50,165
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like a...

2183
02:29:52,267 --> 02:29:55,291
[SPEAKER_07]: Looks like a fabric thing, almost like a green screen, but it's gray.

2184
02:29:56,072 --> 02:29:59,455
[SPEAKER_07]: So it seems like a lot of hassle.

2185
02:30:00,316 --> 02:30:02,319
[SPEAKER_07]: But hey, maybe if it's cheaper, then...

2186
02:30:04,184 --> 02:30:19,297
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, the Oculus Rift it might be I think the Rift sounds more interesting because it's VR whereas this is augmented reality stuff and just I don't really care about AR stuff I remember trying to pull that shit off with the Vita and it sucked Remember the Vita with the AR?

2187
02:30:19,998 --> 02:30:24,962
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, oh, let me try this soccer game Wow, that's shit Okay, cool

2188
02:30:25,618 --> 02:30:25,918
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

2189
02:30:27,419 --> 02:30:28,280
[SPEAKER_06]: One more story for you guys.

2190
02:30:28,320 --> 02:30:33,824
[SPEAKER_06]: I swear, it's like blast from OLR's past tonight, and I guess Jason kind of referenced that in the intro tonight.

2191
02:30:33,924 --> 02:30:40,509
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of true, because we have one more story here tonight, and it's about one of our favorite DDR knockoffs they ever had.

2192
02:30:41,713 --> 02:30:42,233
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

2193
02:31:01,898 --> 02:31:04,900
[SPEAKER_06]: and B, it was the kind of thing that they would just take to Burning Man.

2194
02:31:05,201 --> 02:31:09,444
[SPEAKER_06]: And that type of artsy stuff, that's what you expect to see at Burning Man, that weird stuff.

2195
02:31:10,645 --> 02:31:19,251
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, there were some other festivals Dance Dance Himalayan went to, including the Fine Arts Festival, a Denmark thing called Smuckfest, which...

2196
02:31:19,531 --> 02:31:20,392
[SPEAKER_06]: DDR for hipsters.

2197
02:31:20,592 --> 02:31:21,112
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I guess.

2198
02:31:21,132 --> 02:31:21,372
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

2199
02:31:21,672 --> 02:31:34,100
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyway, the game was officially retired at Burning Man 2013, and then the display was ripped apart, and then in true Burning Man, what the fuck are they even doing anymore fashion?

2200
02:31:34,140 --> 02:31:44,786
[SPEAKER_06]: And look, I have friends that go to Burning Man and love it and swear by it, and I'm not knocking it, but I'm just saying the randomness of some of this shit doesn't help the theories that everybody's on drugs there.

2201
02:31:44,906 --> 02:31:45,706
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just saying...

2202
02:31:46,807 --> 02:31:47,508
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just saying.

2203
02:31:47,868 --> 02:31:49,069
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen the hula hoop cams.

2204
02:31:49,209 --> 02:31:49,949
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just saying.

2205
02:31:50,189 --> 02:31:56,633
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyhow, the way they destroyed it, what I meant to say is that they dropped a piano on it.

2206
02:31:57,854 --> 02:32:00,116
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, they dropped a piano on what was left.

2207
02:32:00,156 --> 02:32:03,898
[SPEAKER_06]: And since I know DarkSakura is dying to see, here it is.

2208
02:32:08,721 --> 02:32:10,462
[SPEAKER_03]: An old powder blue upright.

2209
02:32:10,502 --> 02:32:11,143
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep, and then...

2210
02:32:13,679 --> 02:32:15,681
[SPEAKER_03]: and all the people... I need to go to Burning Man, Rob.

2211
02:32:15,781 --> 02:32:16,923
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just so fucking hard.

2212
02:32:17,463 --> 02:32:17,904
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

2213
02:32:18,404 --> 02:32:18,824
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

2214
02:32:20,086 --> 02:32:20,286
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

2215
02:32:22,148 --> 02:32:22,708
[SPEAKER_07]: I love you.

2216
02:32:22,728 --> 02:32:26,072
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want to take drugs and run naked through the desert, I guess you can do that.

2217
02:32:26,412 --> 02:32:33,940
[SPEAKER_06]: I love you, but sometimes little things make you pretty irritable and going to the desert...

2218
02:32:35,120 --> 02:32:36,701
[SPEAKER_06]: for seven days.

2219
02:32:36,941 --> 02:32:38,262
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd probably want to murder everybody.

2220
02:32:38,462 --> 02:32:41,604
[SPEAKER_06]: Where you, like, I don't know where these people poop.

2221
02:32:43,105 --> 02:32:43,745
[SPEAKER_06]: They have port-a-pots.

2222
02:32:43,765 --> 02:32:44,526
[SPEAKER_03]: They have an RV.

2223
02:32:44,606 --> 02:32:45,866
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess it's RVs or whatever.

2224
02:32:46,206 --> 02:32:47,127
[SPEAKER_03]: They do have sanitation.

2225
02:32:47,147 --> 02:32:48,228
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no such thing as money.

2226
02:32:48,608 --> 02:32:49,588
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a barter system.

2227
02:32:50,589 --> 02:32:54,171
[SPEAKER_06]: And just DarkSakura, I don't think you'd enjoy it.

2228
02:32:54,671 --> 02:32:56,552
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, I think you'd complain a little bit.

2229
02:32:56,592 --> 02:32:57,453
[SPEAKER_03]: I probably wouldn't.

2230
02:32:58,713 --> 02:33:13,585
[SPEAKER_03]: it's just every so often I want to go see some of this stuff in person and then you just reminded me no air conditioning fuck that shit I can't stand hot and I live in Sacramento what am I thinking well you're on drugs

2231
02:33:14,105 --> 02:33:38,114
[SPEAKER_06]: and that's why I'm on the drugs that keep me from murdering people I'm on I just want to make it clear I'm just teasing I don't want to offend the people because I have friends that go to this and they have a great time and they always tell me I should go but I'm like my red-headed ass cannot handle seven days in the desert it's not gonna happen so I'll just what if you I will watch the YouTubes what if you went through the desert on a horse with no name

2232
02:33:42,270 --> 02:33:43,890
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't even want to do this show anymore.

2233
02:33:44,310 --> 02:33:44,591
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

2234
02:33:45,071 --> 02:33:45,491
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just kidding.

2235
02:33:45,551 --> 02:33:45,771
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

2236
02:33:46,791 --> 02:33:48,431
[SPEAKER_06]: I do want to talk to you on Skype.

2237
02:33:48,531 --> 02:33:50,412
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe you'll have a better topic to talk about.

2238
02:33:50,432 --> 02:33:53,572
[SPEAKER_06]: 1-877-GAME-OLR Talk about Rob's redheaded ass.

2239
02:33:55,613 --> 02:33:56,573
[SPEAKER_06]: Stop being weird.

2240
02:33:56,933 --> 02:34:02,294
[SPEAKER_06]: Our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word if you want to give us a call.

2241
02:34:03,355 --> 02:34:07,816
[SPEAKER_06]: Bobby Blackwolf is in our chat room saying, I go to Dragon Con instead of Burning Man.

2242
02:34:08,116 --> 02:34:09,316
[SPEAKER_06]: They're at the same time.

2243
02:34:09,696 --> 02:34:10,997
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know what?

2244
02:34:11,357 --> 02:34:13,818
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's, I think, my new drug of choice, too.

2245
02:34:13,958 --> 02:34:15,419
[SPEAKER_06]: I did really love DragonCon this year.

2246
02:34:15,539 --> 02:34:16,360
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't wait to go back.

2247
02:34:16,700 --> 02:34:21,703
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know how I can poke fun at myself, too, because I said, you know, everyone's on drugs at Burning Man.

2248
02:34:21,943 --> 02:34:23,344
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, at DragonCon, everybody's drunk.

2249
02:34:23,964 --> 02:34:25,265
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody's drunk at DragonCon.

2250
02:34:25,485 --> 02:34:28,047
[SPEAKER_06]: And I say that as a proud DragonCon attendee.

2251
02:34:28,867 --> 02:34:32,169
[SPEAKER_06]: Responsibly, we're responsibly drunk, but I'm just saying.

2252
02:34:32,209 --> 02:34:33,950
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob, next year, fun of me.

2253
02:34:35,060 --> 02:34:36,481
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2254
02:35:00,228 --> 02:35:00,768
[SPEAKER_06]: They love you.

2255
02:35:00,789 --> 02:35:02,149
[SPEAKER_06]: They like Loki, too.

2256
02:35:02,209 --> 02:35:05,570
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, at this point, it'd have to be under some kind of media thing for me.

2257
02:35:05,671 --> 02:35:07,491
[SPEAKER_06]: You are the one that tried to make Lolo gay.

2258
02:35:07,851 --> 02:35:08,792
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's be real.

2259
02:35:09,712 --> 02:35:13,054
[SPEAKER_03]: Look, I can't help it if Lala is really a cross-dresser.

2260
02:35:13,754 --> 02:35:14,814
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm kidding.

2261
02:35:15,074 --> 02:35:16,155
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if you are listening to these shows.

2262
02:35:16,375 --> 02:35:21,277
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't shout them out enough here on the program because, unfortunately, we don't really have a shout-out segment.

2263
02:35:21,297 --> 02:35:24,318
[SPEAKER_06]: But I do want to give a shout-out to folks like GameBooey.

2264
02:35:24,378 --> 02:35:25,819
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know them very well, right?

2265
02:35:25,859 --> 02:35:25,959
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

2266
02:35:26,519 --> 02:35:27,219
[SPEAKER_06]: Koopa Club.

2267
02:35:27,239 --> 02:35:28,960
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if you're listening to them, but they're a lot of fun.

2268
02:35:29,280 --> 02:35:30,041
[SPEAKER_06]: They're out of Chicago.

2269
02:35:30,281 --> 02:35:30,881
[SPEAKER_06]: You would love them.

2270
02:35:31,341 --> 02:35:31,802
[SPEAKER_03]: Chicago.

2271
02:35:32,002 --> 02:35:33,062
[SPEAKER_06]: Video game realness.

2272
02:35:33,462 --> 02:35:33,983
[SPEAKER_06]: Canadian.

2273
02:35:34,543 --> 02:35:35,223
[SPEAKER_06]: Hilarious.

2274
02:35:35,624 --> 02:35:38,365
[SPEAKER_06]: They kind of do what we do here, where they're all at one table in one room.

2275
02:35:38,385 --> 02:35:39,626
[SPEAKER_03]: And they should send us some poutine.

2276
02:35:43,207 --> 02:35:46,189
[SPEAKER_06]: He was bitching about soggy fries from Wingstop earlier.

2277
02:35:46,289 --> 02:35:49,250
[SPEAKER_06]: I do not want FedExed poutine to show up in here.

2278
02:35:49,270 --> 02:35:51,091
[SPEAKER_03]: There's actually a place in town you can get poutine.

2279
02:35:52,332 --> 02:35:53,412
[SPEAKER_06]: Game Bar is another one.

2280
02:35:53,432 --> 02:35:53,813
[SPEAKER_06]: District Club.

2281
02:35:55,171 --> 02:35:58,154
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's an actual restaurant, not a strip club.

2282
02:35:58,694 --> 02:35:58,974
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

2283
02:35:59,255 --> 02:36:00,796
[SPEAKER_07]: I do not need... Oh, Poutine.

2284
02:36:00,816 --> 02:36:01,316
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I'm sorry.

2285
02:36:03,638 --> 02:36:05,380
[SPEAKER_03]: You're thinking of Poutine.

2286
02:36:07,081 --> 02:36:07,561
[SPEAKER_06]: Shut up!

2287
02:36:09,241 --> 02:36:13,243
[SPEAKER_03]: We did already have Kirby birth.

2288
02:36:13,263 --> 02:36:16,244
[SPEAKER_06]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2289
02:36:16,284 --> 02:36:18,365
[SPEAKER_06]: You need to call us or it's going to be the poutine hour.

2290
02:36:19,786 --> 02:36:23,528
[SPEAKER_06]: And Loki may not give you what you think that is with the poutine hour.

2291
02:36:23,928 --> 02:36:24,108
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

2292
02:36:28,330 --> 02:36:31,091
[SPEAKER_06]: Or we could go to Last Minute Stories, Loki, while we wait for some calls.

2293
02:36:32,215 --> 02:36:32,736
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure, why not?

2294
02:36:32,796 --> 02:36:38,160
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's talk about Grand Theft Auto V. It's number two in Japan after debuting.

2295
02:36:38,481 --> 02:36:39,541
[SPEAKER_07]: What was number one, though?

2296
02:36:39,621 --> 02:36:40,342
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm kind of curious.

2297
02:36:40,562 --> 02:36:41,083
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Pokemon.

2298
02:36:41,883 --> 02:36:44,105
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, wait, number two's not bad.

2299
02:36:44,125 --> 02:36:45,406
[SPEAKER_06]: But Nintendo's going bankrupt, y'all.

2300
02:36:46,227 --> 02:36:46,607
[SPEAKER_07]: They are.

2301
02:36:47,248 --> 02:36:48,869
[SPEAKER_07]: They're going to have to do something about it.

2302
02:36:53,213 --> 02:36:53,433
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

2303
02:36:54,253 --> 02:36:54,634
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it?

2304
02:36:54,914 --> 02:36:55,995
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all I got.

2305
02:36:57,878 --> 02:37:03,242
[SPEAKER_07]: There were some stories on... The Xbox One also is not going to support third-party headsets at launch.

2306
02:37:03,703 --> 02:37:04,003
[SPEAKER_07]: Not until 2014.

2307
02:37:04,043 --> 02:37:11,588
[SPEAKER_06]: There were some stories on Zelda this week that we didn't get to, and I don't remember what they were off the top of my head.

2308
02:37:11,608 --> 02:37:12,228
[SPEAKER_03]: Does it involve poutine?

2309
02:37:13,710 --> 02:37:14,050
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

2310
02:37:15,211 --> 02:37:15,491
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

2311
02:37:16,158 --> 02:37:33,794
[SPEAKER_06]: because poutine is the national food of Hyrule if you do the dungeons in a certain order you can actually collect the gravy and the cheese curd power up and go to town we have pianos dropping on DDR machines to set people on fire what?

2312
02:37:33,894 --> 02:37:34,935
[SPEAKER_03]: I just haven't done that in a while

2313
02:37:37,503 --> 02:37:37,723
[SPEAKER_06]: Actdeft.com.

2314
02:38:02,455 --> 02:38:03,496
[SPEAKER_03]: That is actually true.

2315
02:38:04,116 --> 02:38:10,420
[SPEAKER_03]: SSJ100, Matt, you misspelled P-O-U-T-I-N-E, poutine and dongles.

2316
02:38:11,141 --> 02:38:11,721
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are like two.

2317
02:38:11,881 --> 02:38:13,582
[SPEAKER_03]: You know another word that makes me giggle like that?

2318
02:38:14,263 --> 02:38:14,643
[SPEAKER_03]: Balls.

2319
02:38:17,405 --> 02:38:19,066
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm turning DarkSakura's mic off.

2320
02:38:19,546 --> 02:38:20,146
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, thank God.

2321
02:38:20,166 --> 02:38:20,907
[SPEAKER_06]: We're getting a call.

2322
02:38:21,087 --> 02:38:22,728
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank the Lord.

2323
02:38:22,808 --> 02:38:24,569
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody's going to help us talk about something.

2324
02:38:25,190 --> 02:38:26,290
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe Canadian, maybe not.

2325
02:38:26,350 --> 02:38:26,671
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

2326
02:38:26,931 --> 02:38:27,811
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio.

2327
02:38:27,831 --> 02:38:28,132
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's this?

2328
02:38:28,812 --> 02:38:29,713
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, this is Zappy.

2329
02:38:29,833 --> 02:38:30,694
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, Zappy, how you doing?

2330
02:38:30,714 --> 02:38:31,574
[SPEAKER_00]: I officially endorse poutine.

2331
02:38:31,935 --> 02:38:32,395
[SPEAKER_00]: What's that?

2332
02:38:33,155 --> 02:38:34,517
[SPEAKER_00]: I officially endorse poutine.

2333
02:38:34,977 --> 02:38:35,677
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you Canadian?

2334
02:38:36,538 --> 02:38:40,962
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, even though I come from French Canada, so it's really... I love poutine so much.

2335
02:38:41,002 --> 02:38:41,902
[SPEAKER_06]: God damn it!

2336
02:38:42,763 --> 02:38:45,205
[SPEAKER_03]: And I haven't had it since Louisiana.

2337
02:38:45,345 --> 02:38:46,586
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, Zappy, have a great night.

2338
02:38:46,626 --> 02:38:47,647
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm just kidding.

2339
02:38:48,247 --> 02:38:50,409
[SPEAKER_06]: What did you call in to talk to us about tonight, Zappy?

2340
02:38:51,190 --> 02:38:55,613
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, besides poutine, I was going to talk about me playing the Xbox One this week.

2341
02:38:56,654 --> 02:38:56,974
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?

2342
02:38:57,034 --> 02:38:57,655
[SPEAKER_06]: How did that happen?

2343
02:38:58,376 --> 02:39:03,039
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I just went to my local Best Buy and lo and behold, they just had like an Xbox One demo out.

2344
02:39:03,519 --> 02:39:12,725
[SPEAKER_06]: I went into my local Best Buy and like I had to ask to get a copy of Pokemon Y. Like, may I buy a copy of Pokemon because I don't see it on the shelf.

2345
02:39:13,165 --> 02:39:15,226
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't see no Xbox Ones or PlayStations.

2346
02:39:15,487 --> 02:39:17,448
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently, they got their shit together in Canada.

2347
02:39:17,748 --> 02:39:18,348
[SPEAKER_06]: You know why?

2348
02:39:18,649 --> 02:39:21,350
[SPEAKER_06]: Everyone's happy because they're eating french fries smothered in gravy.

2349
02:39:21,590 --> 02:39:23,011
[SPEAKER_06]: And cheese curds.

2350
02:39:23,431 --> 02:39:25,553
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I hate to break it to you, but they had no Pokemon.

2351
02:39:26,233 --> 02:39:26,353
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh.

2352
02:39:27,253 --> 02:39:27,674
[SPEAKER_00]: Sold out.

2353
02:39:27,834 --> 02:39:28,234
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just kidding.

2354
02:39:28,254 --> 02:39:28,474
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

2355
02:39:29,234 --> 02:39:32,215
[SPEAKER_06]: We're moving to Canada tomorrow, by the way.

2356
02:39:32,335 --> 02:39:35,696
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, is that why you went there, Zappy, to get Pokemon and you ended up with Xbox One?

2357
02:39:36,336 --> 02:39:39,437
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I was going to go get the Pokemon from my boyfriend and no.

2358
02:39:39,777 --> 02:39:40,217
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay.

2359
02:39:40,317 --> 02:39:40,557
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

2360
02:39:40,857 --> 02:39:44,979
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, how was Xbox One?

2361
02:39:44,999 --> 02:39:45,479
[SPEAKER_00]: What did you play?

2362
02:39:46,497 --> 02:39:47,257
[SPEAKER_00]: They had Forza 5.

2363
02:39:47,597 --> 02:39:49,418
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, okay, cool.

2364
02:39:49,978 --> 02:39:54,379
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll say this, it's very pretty, but there's one thing that really has me concerned.

2365
02:39:55,280 --> 02:40:01,821
[SPEAKER_00]: They had this demo unit that looked like a complete factory-finished Xbox, and the game was stuttering like no tomorrow.

2366
02:40:03,122 --> 02:40:03,662
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?

2367
02:40:04,426 --> 02:40:09,229
[SPEAKER_07]: It's because it's not actually, it's just the PC and the units.

2368
02:40:09,389 --> 02:40:13,092
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think it's actually, well actually it's the test units I think.

2369
02:40:13,412 --> 02:40:16,093
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they had like a clear container for it.

2370
02:40:16,194 --> 02:40:18,115
[SPEAKER_00]: It looked like a finished Xbox One.

2371
02:40:18,315 --> 02:40:20,136
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's probably not a finished version of the game.

2372
02:40:20,196 --> 02:40:22,377
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember, Forza 5 isn't done yet.

2373
02:40:22,458 --> 02:40:24,799
[SPEAKER_07]: They need to patch in the rest of the game when it comes out.

2374
02:40:24,839 --> 02:40:26,280
[SPEAKER_06]: We're only a month out too.

2375
02:40:26,340 --> 02:40:29,182
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I would think that the real deal is starting to show up.

2376
02:40:29,562 --> 02:40:36,045
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is the copy that they were confident enough to bring to a retail store and have people try out.

2377
02:40:36,725 --> 02:40:56,133
[SPEAKER_06]: And funny enough, I was teasing Bobby Blackwolf because he has the show before us here at VOG Network and I was teasing him earlier because he was talking about demos and I said, well, you know, Bobby, he will make his impression off a video game based off the demo and that's that because I think back to Ni No Kuni and how he refuses to play that full game because the demo was so awful, which it was, but the game's really good.

2378
02:40:56,573 --> 02:40:56,673
[SPEAKER_06]: And

2379
02:40:57,213 --> 02:41:05,498
[SPEAKER_06]: I bring that up because if you're going to make your impressions off this in-store demo unit, then yeah, it should run a little better than being stuttery all over the place.

2380
02:41:07,079 --> 02:41:09,120
[SPEAKER_00]: Besides that, it was very pretty.

2381
02:41:09,320 --> 02:41:10,581
[SPEAKER_00]: The controller is really awesome.

2382
02:41:10,621 --> 02:41:11,361
[SPEAKER_00]: I want one of those.

2383
02:41:12,202 --> 02:41:13,843
[SPEAKER_00]: And it plays like Forza.

2384
02:41:14,583 --> 02:41:19,106
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but more like the old Forzas and not like Forza Horizon Arcade-y, right?

2385
02:41:19,497 --> 02:41:27,823
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, it's like the numbered Forza games There you go, okay, fair enough Were they showing anything else, like Killer Instinct or any of that, or just Forza?

2386
02:41:28,403 --> 02:41:42,853
[SPEAKER_06]: Nope, it was a Forza show I see They had two reps, they probably trained over the weekend showing it off Fair enough, fair enough I was going to say though, since we were talking about Pokemon a minute ago Have you tried playing the Pokemon in 3D?

2387
02:41:42,993 --> 02:41:46,956
[SPEAKER_06]: It kind of stutters too Oh yeah Yeah, that was a little bit disappointing

2388
02:41:47,199 --> 02:41:48,620
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2389
02:42:12,079 --> 02:42:13,619
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, what the hell are you doing in chat?

2390
02:42:13,659 --> 02:42:14,180
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

2391
02:42:14,220 --> 02:42:17,420
[SPEAKER_03]: I tried to put one stupid little link and the whole thing copied.

2392
02:42:18,040 --> 02:42:20,641
[SPEAKER_06]: And DarkSakura got kicked for flooding the chat.

2393
02:42:20,701 --> 02:42:21,441
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

2394
02:42:22,161 --> 02:42:23,562
[SPEAKER_06]: She was speaking in tongues.

2395
02:42:25,822 --> 02:42:27,803
[SPEAKER_03]: That was actually a complete and total accident.

2396
02:42:28,243 --> 02:42:28,603
[SPEAKER_06]: Whoops.

2397
02:42:28,803 --> 02:42:29,143
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

2398
02:42:29,383 --> 02:42:30,303
[SPEAKER_06]: Good job, DarkSakura.

2399
02:42:30,363 --> 02:42:30,583
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

2400
02:42:30,923 --> 02:42:31,604
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, Zappy.

2401
02:42:32,204 --> 02:42:37,045
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the thing is, sure, 3D isn't that useful, but this is what they sold the system on.

2402
02:42:37,425 --> 02:42:41,586
[SPEAKER_00]: You have 3D games and it looks like they're moving away from the things they were selling their own system on.

2403
02:42:43,316 --> 02:42:45,697
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, what's the verdict for you?

2404
02:42:45,837 --> 02:42:48,237
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you on board with next-gen gaming?

2405
02:42:48,277 --> 02:42:50,498
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you going to get an Xbox One or a PlayStation 4?

2406
02:42:51,458 --> 02:43:02,700
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm considering it just because I was able to pre-order an Xbox One for $100 off because I just used the staples to stack a whole bunch of coupons.

2407
02:43:04,280 --> 02:43:07,161
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're going to go Xbox One with that money off then?

2408
02:43:07,802 --> 02:43:11,004
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm thinking about it because $400 puts it at the same price as a PS4.

2409
02:43:11,244 --> 02:43:11,845
[SPEAKER_06]: That's true.

2410
02:43:11,905 --> 02:43:17,829
[SPEAKER_06]: If you can lessen the price, Xbox One does have some exclusives that are worth looking at.

2411
02:43:19,510 --> 02:43:22,011
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but on the other hand, the launch lineup just isn't there.

2412
02:43:22,352 --> 02:43:23,252
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I hear you.

2413
02:43:23,713 --> 02:43:26,655
[SPEAKER_06]: And like Loki, he's waiting six months, so there's nothing wrong with that.

2414
02:43:27,816 --> 02:43:29,778
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well Zappy, I'm going to let you go to see if anybody else calls.

2415
02:43:29,798 --> 02:43:30,419
[SPEAKER_06]: But thanks for calling.

2416
02:43:30,439 --> 02:43:33,743
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think we've heard from you in forever and it's good to hear the impressions of the Xbox One.

2417
02:43:34,404 --> 02:43:35,165
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, cool.

2418
02:43:35,405 --> 02:43:36,426
[SPEAKER_06]: Next time, pretty poutine.

2419
02:43:37,327 --> 02:43:38,048
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep, with Smokey.

2420
02:43:38,228 --> 02:43:38,829
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, sounds good.

2421
02:43:38,849 --> 02:43:40,030
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye.

2422
02:43:42,244 --> 02:43:46,166
[SPEAKER_06]: 1877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2423
02:43:46,186 --> 02:43:47,046
[SPEAKER_03]: I figured out what it did.

2424
02:43:47,867 --> 02:43:51,028
[SPEAKER_03]: It actually copied the image data and not the URL.

2425
02:43:51,809 --> 02:43:55,450
[SPEAKER_03]: I have no idea how that happened because I highlighted the URL to copy it.

2426
02:43:56,411 --> 02:43:58,592
[SPEAKER_03]: So my iPad is currently the devil.

2427
02:44:00,083 --> 02:44:04,348
[SPEAKER_06]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or use your name on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2428
02:44:04,408 --> 02:44:05,770
[SPEAKER_03]: We need more poutine.

2429
02:44:06,110 --> 02:44:08,974
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm trying to go to tweets and see what else has been tweeted at us tonight.

2430
02:44:08,994 --> 02:44:10,256
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone new should call us.

2431
02:44:10,336 --> 02:44:11,217
[SPEAKER_03]: I want new.

2432
02:44:11,978 --> 02:44:15,582
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I love all of you people seriously and I love talking with you, but we need someone new calling.

2433
02:44:16,123 --> 02:44:17,184
[SPEAKER_03]: New voices, new blood.

2434
02:44:18,286 --> 02:44:31,258
[SPEAKER_06]: Actdeft sent us a tweet, but it's a tweet from Eurogamer about the extension of the games for gold on 360, which I think we had talked about earlier.

2435
02:44:31,598 --> 02:44:34,781
[SPEAKER_06]: I was trying to see if there was more games announced on it, but I don't think so.

2436
02:44:34,841 --> 02:44:38,324
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't realize they got the exact same games in Europe, but I guess that makes sense that they do.

2437
02:44:39,585 --> 02:44:43,367
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, Sterlok tweeted us saying, what was the music from tonight?

2438
02:44:43,487 --> 02:44:44,247
[SPEAKER_06]: Very awesome.

2439
02:44:44,547 --> 02:44:47,608
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, clearly you're talking about the song Always by Erasure.

2440
02:44:47,928 --> 02:44:49,329
[SPEAKER_06]: It's what we played during the Fugle.

2441
02:44:49,489 --> 02:44:51,049
[SPEAKER_03]: We need more Erasure on the show.

2442
02:44:51,149 --> 02:44:51,550
[SPEAKER_06]: We do.

2443
02:44:51,790 --> 02:44:52,030
[SPEAKER_06]: We did.

2444
02:44:52,150 --> 02:44:52,990
[SPEAKER_06]: I can make that happen.

2445
02:44:53,110 --> 02:44:54,891
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't, uh, don't think I won't.

2446
02:44:55,411 --> 02:44:56,631
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's it for Twitter topics.

2447
02:44:56,672 --> 02:44:57,692
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't get a whole lot tonight.

2448
02:44:57,752 --> 02:44:59,753
[SPEAKER_06]: So twitter.com slash OLR.

2449
02:44:59,933 --> 02:45:02,354
[SPEAKER_03]: We need a new ending song and it should be all through the years.

2450
02:45:03,654 --> 02:45:03,854
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

2451
02:45:03,894 --> 02:45:07,535
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to put out one more call for phone calls and then we're going to wrap it up.

2452
02:45:07,596 --> 02:45:08,756
[SPEAKER_03]: No, you should call tonight.

2453
02:45:09,335 --> 02:45:09,815
[SPEAKER_03]: See y'all?

2454
02:45:10,876 --> 02:45:11,637
[SPEAKER_03]: Do it now!

2455
02:45:11,657 --> 02:45:16,040
[SPEAKER_06]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2456
02:45:17,100 --> 02:45:18,962
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're out of last minute stories, right?

2457
02:45:19,582 --> 02:45:19,882
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

2458
02:45:20,222 --> 02:45:22,444
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there any more food stories somebody wants to tell?

2459
02:45:22,564 --> 02:45:23,385
[SPEAKER_06]: Pool tea!

2460
02:45:24,474 --> 02:45:29,437
[SPEAKER_07]: I think they have that actually over at Sprouts or even like Whole Foods or something like that.

2461
02:45:29,457 --> 02:45:31,137
[SPEAKER_07]: They have like their weird food over there.

2462
02:45:31,338 --> 02:45:32,278
[SPEAKER_03]: I could just make it at home.

2463
02:45:32,938 --> 02:45:33,038
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

2464
02:45:33,078 --> 02:45:33,979
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe I'm just thinking of the cheese first.

2465
02:45:33,999 --> 02:45:35,400
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not that difficult if you think about it.

2466
02:45:35,420 --> 02:45:37,080
[SPEAKER_03]: I say sacrifice your face first.

2467
02:45:37,361 --> 02:45:37,701
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

2468
02:45:37,781 --> 02:45:38,541
[SPEAKER_03]: Degenerate Johnny.

2469
02:45:39,021 --> 02:45:39,362
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

2470
02:45:39,382 --> 02:45:40,702
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I guess nobody wants to call.

2471
02:45:40,742 --> 02:45:41,443
[SPEAKER_06]: That makes me sad.

2472
02:45:41,463 --> 02:45:44,864
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm going to close up the Skype line and I will encourage you guys to email us in a future week.

2473
02:45:44,904 --> 02:45:48,927
[SPEAKER_06]: Mailbag at OrangeLongTrader.com or you can also send us a tweet.

2474
02:45:48,987 --> 02:45:53,389
[SPEAKER_06]: Twitter.com slash OLR and those are all the ways you can interact with us as well.

2475
02:45:54,310 --> 02:45:57,552
[SPEAKER_06]: Otherwise, that does it for another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

2476
02:45:57,893 --> 02:46:00,275
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to say thank you guys very much for listening to the show.

2477
02:46:01,416 --> 02:46:05,339
[SPEAKER_06]: The nominating stuff is over for the podcast awards, but I do want to give a quick thank you.

2478
02:46:05,359 --> 02:46:12,606
[SPEAKER_06]: If you did take the time out of your day to nominate us, or at least nominate another deserving independent podcast, even if it wasn't us, I want to say thank you.

2479
02:46:13,607 --> 02:46:17,971
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll know the results of that, I think it's the same time as this show next week, so that could be interesting.

2480
02:46:18,311 --> 02:46:22,313
[SPEAKER_06]: So we can have our disappointment drinks when we don't get nominated.

2481
02:46:22,333 --> 02:46:24,893
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll have a pile of poutine that will drown our sorrows in.

2482
02:46:25,033 --> 02:46:26,554
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, fist bump.

2483
02:46:26,614 --> 02:46:27,174
[SPEAKER_03]: Poutine.

2484
02:46:28,615 --> 02:46:29,995
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want some poutine, Loki?

2485
02:46:30,175 --> 02:46:30,335
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

2486
02:46:30,595 --> 02:46:31,456
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that part of your diet?

2487
02:46:32,116 --> 02:46:32,636
[SPEAKER_06]: Poutine.

2488
02:46:32,796 --> 02:46:33,276
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

2489
02:46:33,417 --> 02:46:33,957
[SPEAKER_03]: Budget for it.

2490
02:46:34,037 --> 02:46:36,638
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think that there's a ketogenic version of poutine.

2491
02:46:36,658 --> 02:46:37,398
[SPEAKER_03]: Just budget for it.

2492
02:46:37,418 --> 02:46:38,038
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all you have to do.

2493
02:46:38,058 --> 02:46:38,658
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

2494
02:46:40,379 --> 02:46:41,040
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.

2495
02:47:02,103 --> 02:47:07,551
[SPEAKER_06]: You can also leave us a nice review on iTunes, Stitcher, Thumbs Up, you know, all the places where you found this podcast.

2496
02:47:07,872 --> 02:47:09,274
[SPEAKER_06]: Other people will find podcasts too.

2497
02:47:10,155 --> 02:47:12,098
[SPEAKER_06]: It's time to go around and get everybody's final thought.

2498
02:47:12,438 --> 02:47:14,181
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, starting us off tonight, your final thought.

2499
02:47:15,167 --> 02:47:39,849
[SPEAKER_07]: well we'll be playing more Grand Theft Auto this week and hopefully you should see an announcement about the next game night we'll maybe do another game night or maybe we'll do like one week because Friday seems to be a lot better for people because it's hard to play so maybe we'll do another game night Friday and then we'll switch it up to the next platform the next Friday or something like that switch off until some other games come out

2500
02:47:41,028 --> 02:48:09,561
[SPEAKER_06]: um my final thought tonight is um I don't know uh I uh I need to get working on my Halloween costume because I haven't started yet and I really need to do that and I need to not slack off and also I need to do more live game streaming because I've been slacking off on that too so uh even though I was joking earlier about how everybody's live streaming oh well I'm gonna do it too uh because there's some other games out there I'm playing that I want to show you guys that aren't just Final Fantasy 14 believe it or not and last but not least DarkSakura your final thought tonight

2501
02:48:09,761 --> 02:48:12,322
[SPEAKER_03]: The closest thing I have to cheese curds is cottage cheese.

2502
02:48:14,003 --> 02:48:14,623
[SPEAKER_03]: That sucks.

2503
02:48:16,023 --> 02:48:17,564
[SPEAKER_06]: Could you put cottage cheese on french fries?

2504
02:48:17,984 --> 02:48:19,605
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't eat french fries.

2505
02:48:20,845 --> 02:48:21,906
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

2506
02:48:23,986 --> 02:48:27,127
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel healthier than I have in the last three weeks.

2507
02:48:28,388 --> 02:48:29,989
[SPEAKER_03]: And I want to start playing DDR again.

2508
02:48:30,189 --> 02:48:30,969
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my final thought.

2509
02:48:31,559 --> 02:48:31,919
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

2510
02:48:32,119 --> 02:48:32,460
[SPEAKER_06]: Good luck.

2511
02:48:32,480 --> 02:48:33,420
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to make it a thing.

2512
02:48:33,760 --> 02:48:34,261
[SPEAKER_06]: A thing.

2513
02:48:34,441 --> 02:48:34,941
[SPEAKER_06]: A thing.

2514
02:48:35,061 --> 02:48:35,541
