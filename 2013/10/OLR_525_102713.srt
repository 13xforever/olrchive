1
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,101
[SPEAKER_06]: All this and more begins right now.

2
00:00:31,377 --> 00:00:36,559
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

3
00:00:36,659 --> 00:00:43,941
[SPEAKER_07]: It is Orange Lounge Radio episode number 525, October the 27th, 2013.

4
00:00:44,081 --> 00:00:51,303
[SPEAKER_07]: My name is Rob Roberts here with all you guys to talk about video games and gaming culture and so on and so forth with my co-hosts.

5
00:00:51,743 --> 00:00:54,764
[SPEAKER_07]: First up, the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

6
00:00:54,944 --> 00:00:55,744
[SPEAKER_03]: Can't tell it pruning.

7
00:00:57,125 --> 00:00:58,265
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't be gardening.

8
00:00:58,645 --> 00:01:00,946
[SPEAKER_07]: You're in the kitchen slash studio right now.

9
00:01:01,426 --> 00:01:02,347
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Animal Crossing.

10
00:01:02,367 --> 00:01:03,167
[SPEAKER_03]: She's just like a witch.

11
00:01:03,447 --> 00:01:05,509
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow, you actually have a little witch's hat for your character.

12
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:07,250
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I paid money for Gracie items.

13
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:07,810
[SPEAKER_03]: Adorable.

14
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:08,811
[SPEAKER_03]: I have the full store now.

15
00:01:09,071 --> 00:01:09,371
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

16
00:01:09,791 --> 00:01:12,313
[SPEAKER_07]: You are like really hardcore into this Animal Crossing stuff.

17
00:01:12,353 --> 00:01:13,313
[SPEAKER_03]: It's no joke.

18
00:01:13,614 --> 00:01:16,976
[SPEAKER_03]: I have two characters that are mine and I made one for Julian because I'm bribing him.

19
00:01:17,776 --> 00:01:19,257
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'll talk about that during my gaming week.

20
00:01:19,457 --> 00:01:20,477
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm at the gym, let's play Pokemon game

21
00:01:41,798 --> 00:01:57,616
[SPEAKER_07]: I will say the new one is like way there's just more excitement and it's just a better coat of paint or just something it really energizes that whole brand in a way I haven't felt in a very long time well Hanukkah is coming up so whatever ask Hanukkah Harry for one no alright

22
00:01:58,446 --> 00:01:59,126
[SPEAKER_03]: I like how you think.

23
00:02:18,731 --> 00:02:26,339
[SPEAKER_03]: And then telling me that the eight people, however many people before me, you know, I'm just, I don't want to go much too into the interview.

24
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:27,120
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure, sure, sure.

25
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,903
[SPEAKER_07]: Cross your fingers, cross your toes, light some candles, say a prayer, whatever.

26
00:02:30,063 --> 00:02:32,826
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying not to be excited, but I need a prayer circle, Rob.

27
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,582
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, let's join hands.

28
00:02:35,342 --> 00:02:39,206
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, joining us in our prayer circle this evening, say hello to Tech Master Loki.

29
00:02:39,787 --> 00:02:39,987
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi.

30
00:02:40,147 --> 00:02:40,788
[SPEAKER_07]: How you doing, Loki?

31
00:02:41,649 --> 00:02:42,109
[SPEAKER_08]: Doing all right.

32
00:02:42,229 --> 00:02:42,510
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah?

33
00:02:43,331 --> 00:02:50,758
[SPEAKER_08]: I wanted to get better food for dinner other than McDonald's, but I was too busy looking for UFO parts in Grand Theft Auto.

34
00:02:50,778 --> 00:02:50,858
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh.

35
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:54,001
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, wait a minute, is that like a toy for Josh?

36
00:02:54,401 --> 00:02:55,422
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, it's a Grand Theft Auto thing.

37
00:02:56,683 --> 00:03:00,787
[SPEAKER_07]: I will tell you this, Loki, I came so close to finally jumping on that Grand Theft Auto 5 bandwagon this week.

38
00:03:00,827 --> 00:03:08,653
[SPEAKER_07]: We were at Fry's or Best Buy or one of those stores, and I almost did it, but then I was like, wait, Rob, you have an unopened copy of Grand Theft Auto 4 sitting on your shelf.

39
00:03:09,093 --> 00:03:09,954
[SPEAKER_07]: This is not okay.

40
00:03:10,034 --> 00:03:13,277
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't get on the 5 bandwagon until you at least play some 4.

41
00:03:14,337 --> 00:03:33,526
[SPEAKER_07]: you can get on the five bandwagon just fine and then Alan is like although I mean it will look that much better but you know I still think you can get on the bandwagon without playing it for but Alan is like Alan is like why don't you just wait in like a year there'll be the steam sale it'll be six bucks on PC what do you I mean granted we don't really have a PC version confirmed but

42
00:03:34,457 --> 00:03:36,480
[SPEAKER_07]: We all know it'll probably happen at some point.

43
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,344
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, he's encouraging me to wait.

44
00:03:39,364 --> 00:03:41,126
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm like, everybody's playing it now.

45
00:03:41,847 --> 00:03:44,050
[SPEAKER_07]: They're having the VOG nights now.

46
00:03:44,951 --> 00:03:45,512
[SPEAKER_07]: It's fun.

47
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:46,533
[SPEAKER_07]: You're missing out.

48
00:03:46,753 --> 00:03:50,258
[SPEAKER_07]: But I need to save my money for the PlayStation 4 and all the games that aren't coming out.

49
00:03:51,219 --> 00:03:52,120
[SPEAKER_03]: Happy Birthday to Actdeft

50
00:04:12,577 --> 00:04:17,319
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not his birthday, but we always are happy to have him here in studio joining us with the show.

51
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:18,340
[SPEAKER_07]: Say hello, everybody.

52
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,200
[SPEAKER_07]: It's his unbirthday.

53
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:23,222
[SPEAKER_07]: So a merry unbirthday to VXJasonXV, or just Jason.

54
00:04:23,382 --> 00:04:24,923
[SPEAKER_06]: The other Mexican across the table, no less.

55
00:04:25,003 --> 00:04:25,763
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

56
00:04:26,204 --> 00:04:26,924
[SPEAKER_06]: How you doing?

57
00:04:26,984 --> 00:04:28,265
[SPEAKER_06]: Just not living in Mexico.

58
00:04:28,325 --> 00:04:28,765
[SPEAKER_07]: Quienes.

59
00:04:40,148 --> 00:04:44,349
[SPEAKER_07]: Jason is the new VO guy for basically VOG Network.

60
00:04:44,589 --> 00:04:51,711
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, Bobby does some of the VOs, but you're slowly kind of taking over because since you don't have a show right now, you did have one for a while, right?

61
00:04:51,831 --> 00:04:55,992
[SPEAKER_06]: Not on a network, not affiliated, but I was doing a podcast with some friends for a while.

62
00:04:56,232 --> 00:04:57,752
[SPEAKER_07]: That was before VOG and all that, right?

63
00:04:57,972 --> 00:04:59,714
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

64
00:05:20,456 --> 00:05:31,099
[SPEAKER_06]: I have my microphone set up sitting nice and ready I love my studio studio slash office set up and I thought hey Rob can always use an extra hour on Sunday so this is probably a good idea

65
00:05:31,556 --> 00:05:58,396
[SPEAKER_07]: I like to think if the worst ever happened and OLR and Horde House were like both suddenly done which I don't even like to think about that but you know all things come to an end eventually nothing's on the radar yet folks I don't want to scare anybody but I like to think if these projects were to ever come to an end that's kind of like what I would want to do is it's like oh but that's like I've been doing this radio amateur stuff so long like I would have to do something for someone somewhere you know

66
00:05:59,176 --> 00:06:08,221
[SPEAKER_07]: But I like to think I could just start up another show somewhere, but maybe, I don't know, maybe in 10 years I would not really want to do that anymore and I'd just do VOs for somebody else.

67
00:06:08,281 --> 00:06:12,283
[SPEAKER_06]: And you have a ton of expertise that you can provide to someone else for the actual aspects of running a show.

68
00:06:12,344 --> 00:06:13,424
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, inflate my ego more.

69
00:06:13,444 --> 00:06:16,986
[SPEAKER_06]: Producer, you know, producer, engineering, set up for streaming, recording.

70
00:06:17,206 --> 00:06:18,327
[SPEAKER_06]: Keep talking, you're my friend.

71
00:06:18,967 --> 00:06:22,189
[SPEAKER_06]: There's many, many ways to put together a show, live podcast or otherwise.

72
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:26,492
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody could be better and somebody with expertise could provide that.

73
00:06:26,512 --> 00:06:27,092
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

74
00:06:27,652 --> 00:06:34,976
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I couldn't do this every week and I don't think DarkSakura or Loki or even Jason could do this every week either if it weren't for the chatters.

75
00:06:35,116 --> 00:06:40,378
[SPEAKER_07]: And so hello to our chatroom, live.vognetwork.com and hello to the podcast listeners as well.

76
00:06:40,438 --> 00:06:42,179
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want you guys to feel neglected.

77
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:45,120
[SPEAKER_07]: We love everybody who participates with our show in one way or another.

78
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:48,302
[SPEAKER_07]: But we do have the live chatters over at live.vognetwork.com.

79
00:06:48,342 --> 00:06:52,204
[SPEAKER_07]: Tiger Claw says, I wish Rob did the intro with the auto-tune.

80
00:06:53,144 --> 00:06:54,046
[SPEAKER_07]: I will say this.

81
00:06:54,186 --> 00:07:02,018
[SPEAKER_07]: We once were looking at doing a segment on the show that was Extifer sings the virtual console release dates.

82
00:07:02,218 --> 00:07:05,223
[SPEAKER_07]: Back when the Wii was newer and there was a virtual console every week.

83
00:07:05,263 --> 00:07:08,507
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that was right when that app came out on iPhone that was like IMT Paint or whatever.

84
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:08,648
[SPEAKER_04]: Mm-hmm.

85
00:07:08,848 --> 00:07:09,808
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

86
00:07:33,533 --> 00:07:33,914
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.

87
00:07:34,034 --> 00:07:37,557
[SPEAKER_08]: Which, spoiler alert, sucks ass.

88
00:07:37,598 --> 00:07:41,822
[SPEAKER_08]: But you can if you sort of try to sing, I guess, over it.

89
00:07:42,242 --> 00:07:44,084
[SPEAKER_08]: It sort of sounds auto-tuned.

90
00:07:45,606 --> 00:07:46,287
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

91
00:07:46,667 --> 00:07:47,248
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

92
00:07:48,529 --> 00:07:49,811
[SPEAKER_03]: We both have Audition.

93
00:07:50,792 --> 00:07:51,012
[SPEAKER_08]: Mm-hmm.

94
00:07:51,832 --> 00:07:54,894
[SPEAKER_03]: All I need to do is sit down for an hour and I can probably figure out how to do it.

95
00:07:55,034 --> 00:07:55,594
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, yeah, no, no.

96
00:07:55,634 --> 00:07:58,395
[SPEAKER_07]: Now it's... I mean, keep in mind, this was five years ago.

97
00:07:58,515 --> 00:08:00,616
[SPEAKER_07]: We have new toys now that we didn't have five years ago.

98
00:08:01,197 --> 00:08:04,158
[SPEAKER_07]: But we also don't have Extifer as my roommate anymore.

99
00:08:04,258 --> 00:08:06,519
[SPEAKER_07]: So that idea is kind of long gone.

100
00:08:06,539 --> 00:08:07,540
[SPEAKER_03]: We have the internet.

101
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:08,260
[SPEAKER_07]: We do.

102
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:08,820
[SPEAKER_07]: We do.

103
00:08:09,481 --> 00:08:10,641
[SPEAKER_07]: But there's no virtual console.

104
00:08:10,661 --> 00:08:18,085
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I guess Wii U virtual console games, but it's not... I remember when the Wii was first out, we were seeing virtual console games all the time.

105
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:19,045
[SPEAKER_07]: It was like three a week.

106
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:19,646
[SPEAKER_07]: And on Wii U...

107
00:08:20,936 --> 00:08:22,117
[SPEAKER_07]: They've been trickling through.

108
00:08:22,177 --> 00:08:24,778
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like every week we're getting something, but let's be real.

109
00:08:24,918 --> 00:08:27,779
[SPEAKER_07]: It hasn't been a very strong lineup the past week or so.

110
00:08:28,059 --> 00:08:31,581
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I think one week we got tennis and baseball.

111
00:08:32,501 --> 00:08:37,144
[SPEAKER_07]: And those were like the Nintendo versions, like very basic versions of those games.

112
00:08:37,164 --> 00:08:37,764
[SPEAKER_06]: The launch titles.

113
00:08:37,784 --> 00:08:38,764
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, part of the launch lineup.

114
00:08:38,784 --> 00:08:40,425
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, they're basically named for crying out loud.

115
00:08:40,445 --> 00:08:41,586
[SPEAKER_06]: That tells you when they came out.

116
00:08:41,726 --> 00:08:42,446
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, exactly.

117
00:08:42,466 --> 00:08:46,128
[SPEAKER_06]: We could do the regular PlayStation Plus member awards thing.

118
00:08:46,488 --> 00:08:47,709
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

119
00:09:11,438 --> 00:09:17,325
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, if you would dive into the email bag and pull out the email that I licked.

120
00:09:18,386 --> 00:09:19,368
[SPEAKER_03]: The email that you licked?

121
00:09:19,568 --> 00:09:19,848
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

122
00:09:20,289 --> 00:09:21,991
[SPEAKER_07]: It has the saliva all over it.

123
00:09:22,071 --> 00:09:25,895
[SPEAKER_03]: While I multitask opening my village for everybody who wanted me to do it.

124
00:09:26,676 --> 00:09:27,437
[SPEAKER_03]: Animals can wait.

125
00:09:27,818 --> 00:09:28,438
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they can.

126
00:09:28,498 --> 00:09:29,540
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just being nice to people.

127
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:32,042
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, OLR crew, AZHP here.

128
00:09:32,422 --> 00:09:35,505
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to get something off my chest that's been bugging me for a few weeks now.

129
00:09:35,905 --> 00:09:42,010
[SPEAKER_03]: I had some friends over to play scary games a few weeks ago, and a lot of them were giving advice on how to play Amnesia.

130
00:09:42,651 --> 00:09:46,474
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I asked them if any wanted to play since they had played it before, and they said, Oh, I haven't played it before.

131
00:09:46,514 --> 00:09:47,735
[SPEAKER_03]: I watched a playthrough on YouTube.

132
00:09:48,236 --> 00:09:54,861
[SPEAKER_03]: This got me kind of bummed out because I feel some of the magic of experiencing the game together with friends was gone because they knew what was going to happen.

133
00:09:56,082 --> 00:10:07,678
[SPEAKER_03]: When I discovered that watching scary game playthroughs is actually way more common than I thought, some of the most popular videos of the game Outlast have millions of views.

134
00:10:08,239 --> 00:10:13,466
[SPEAKER_03]: Outlast is an indie game and certainly hasn't sold millions of copies, so prospects for a sequel are slim at this time.

135
00:10:13,846 --> 00:10:17,587
[SPEAKER_03]: So my question to you guys is, do you think streaming is hurting certain genres of games?

136
00:10:18,187 --> 00:10:23,029
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a slightly different discussion than Nintendo streaming kerfluffle that happened a few months ago.

137
00:10:23,369 --> 00:10:30,011
[SPEAKER_03]: Because Nintendo games are often games with excellent gameplay mechanics that makes you want to play, want to have your own experience with the game.

138
00:10:30,532 --> 00:10:33,092
[SPEAKER_03]: Even after, I'm about to get logged out, sorry.

139
00:10:35,113 --> 00:10:37,775
[SPEAKER_03]: Even after watching someone play it.

140
00:10:38,756 --> 00:10:41,518
[SPEAKER_03]: But is that necessarily the same for horror games?

141
00:10:41,598 --> 00:10:45,080
[SPEAKER_03]: After seeing the twists and scares, does that make you want to go out and play the game?

142
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:51,604
[SPEAKER_03]: And to play Devil's Advocate, were these people just never going to play these games because they were too scared to play it by themselves?

143
00:10:52,085 --> 00:11:04,153
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like with the easy answer being, let's watch a playthrough on YouTube, these people who watch the stream could have mustered up enough courage to get a friend or two over and play the game as they are huddled up with blankets over their heads, gripping each other in fear.

144
00:11:05,053 --> 00:11:07,275
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this something we may lose forever due to streaming?

145
00:11:08,016 --> 00:11:10,319
[SPEAKER_03]: I've rambled enough, but I'd love to hear your thoughts on the issue.

146
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:11,159
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep up the great work.

147
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,461
[SPEAKER_03]: Love always, AZHP.

148
00:11:12,932 --> 00:11:20,297
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a really good question, and that's why I wanted to pull it at the top of the show as a kickoff topic, because it's also timely with Halloween being this next week.

149
00:11:20,337 --> 00:11:28,142
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of people are thinking about scary games, and I'm sure some of you, I don't know if you guys do this, or maybe people listening, but... We have to watch Showgirls.

150
00:11:29,323 --> 00:11:33,066
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody has their tradition, and mine is watching Showgirls every Halloween, because it's a scary movie.

151
00:11:33,486 --> 00:11:38,890
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm sure some of you bring people over, and y'all play Silent Hill, or y'all play Amnesia.

152
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:40,371
[SPEAKER_03]: We've done that at your old place with Exifer.

153
00:11:40,391 --> 00:11:40,531
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

154
00:11:40,771 --> 00:11:41,331
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, certainly.

155
00:11:41,631 --> 00:11:42,932
[SPEAKER_07]: But this is a really good question.

156
00:11:43,132 --> 00:11:59,878
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, just in general, and it doesn't even necessarily have to be about streaming or about scary games, but is this new technology in this world that we live in as gamers where Twitch TV is getting more and more popular and all its knockoffs, is this hurting gaming more than we want to admit?

157
00:12:00,538 --> 00:12:02,319
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no one really watches it for the twists.

158
00:12:02,339 --> 00:12:04,660
[SPEAKER_08]: They watch it for the people reacting to playing the games.

159
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:05,300
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really what it is.

160
00:12:06,241 --> 00:12:06,741
[SPEAKER_03]: Not me.

161
00:12:07,302 --> 00:12:21,633
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't really... I'm with you, because of course my mind is going to go to, if you listen to Horde House, you know our buddy Gemet over there is infamous for doing these playthroughs where he screams at the top of his lungs while playing Slenderman, and people love it.

162
00:12:21,653 --> 00:12:22,213
[SPEAKER_07]: They heat it up.

163
00:12:22,714 --> 00:12:24,075
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why it's so popular.

164
00:12:24,495 --> 00:12:31,220
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not really about the game itself, which, I mean, the game's good, but it's watching these over-the-top reactions, which is why people do it, right?

165
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:31,340
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

166
00:12:31,761 --> 00:12:37,466
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I mean, I saw some footage of Amnesia before, I just don't remember it.

167
00:12:39,687 --> 00:12:54,459
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I remember, and even though I've beaten the game a bajillion times, I watch playthroughs of Silent Hill 3, because that's my favorite game, and sometimes I don't feel like putting it in and playing through everything, I just want to watch all the cinematics.

168
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:55,720
[SPEAKER_03]: You know?

169
00:12:56,781 --> 00:13:10,972
[SPEAKER_03]: for me it's more or less that I go back and re-watch scenes of games that I've already played like especially scenes that I really like the only game I think as far as scary games that I've done that with are pretty much games I don't intend to ever play

170
00:13:12,093 --> 00:13:15,295
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to see exactly how bad this is type of game.

171
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:23,119
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not as much into Resident Evil anymore, so I'll watch a playthrough of one of the Resident Evil games just to keep up on the story.

172
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:25,460
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't really want to play it.

173
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:26,980
[SPEAKER_03]: For me, I don't care.

174
00:13:27,521 --> 00:13:32,623
[SPEAKER_03]: If someone was like, oh yeah, let's come over and have a bunch of people while we play through this and make fun of it.

175
00:13:33,023 --> 00:13:34,204
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where you get the fun.

176
00:13:35,245 --> 00:13:40,027
[SPEAKER_03]: Even if you've already seen it, as long as you're not spoiling it for people like your friends were spoiling it for you.

177
00:13:41,067 --> 00:13:43,188
[SPEAKER_03]: Then that's the difference.

178
00:13:43,749 --> 00:13:45,530
[SPEAKER_03]: People just need to have a little bit of respect.

179
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:48,911
[SPEAKER_03]: If they know you haven't played through it before, they need to keep their big mouth shut.

180
00:13:49,351 --> 00:13:59,717
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the emailer brings up a good point, though, is that there are probably people out there where they're not sure if they want to buy a scary $10, $15 video game that's out there right now.

181
00:13:59,917 --> 00:14:02,158
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's say Outlast, I think was the example used in the email.

182
00:14:02,418 --> 00:14:03,099
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

183
00:14:18,754 --> 00:14:43,381
[SPEAKER_07]: I kind of think it's a it's a decent argument now I sort of think though it's twofold I kind of think for every person you convince not to buy the game I think there's people you also convince to buy the game that may not have done so before so I think there is a little bit of both there's the bad news and there's good news that we might be neglecting here a little bit Jason you have any thoughts on this and I invite our chat room to respond to at live.vognetwork.com

184
00:14:43,681 --> 00:14:58,992
[SPEAKER_06]: I was basically going to say that I agree with what Loki said and that there's going to be a lot of people that are going to use this as an excuse to see a game without playing it, whether it's for saving money, whether it's for something that they just didn't get a chance to play.

185
00:14:59,712 --> 00:15:13,664
[SPEAKER_06]: but there's nothing wrong with that for the same exact point that you made in that somebody else can get turned on to this a game they didn't hear of a game they were on the fence for they see a tiny little bit of it it interests them they want to see the rest of the story around it and so forth

186
00:15:15,198 --> 00:15:41,677
[SPEAKER_06]: you know there's a lot of games that come out right now and nobody plays every single one of them so having something that kind of fills the void of being able to see what a game was get a story in a universe that you're interested in it's not a bad thing everybody does not play all of the same games question for you guys at the table have any of you been convinced to buy a video game because of a live stream I want to say I did I can't remember what it is

187
00:15:43,033 --> 00:15:49,338
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well not because of a stream, but it showed a lot of the gameplay in a YouTube video.

188
00:15:49,878 --> 00:15:51,640
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how I bought Drunken Robot Pornography.

189
00:15:52,401 --> 00:15:58,486
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, yeah, it was more of a review, but he played through like a good bit of what had been out, and I was like, heck yeah, I want this.

190
00:15:59,407 --> 00:16:01,348
[SPEAKER_03]: Just listening to the music made me want that game.

191
00:16:01,869 --> 00:16:07,313
[SPEAKER_03]: I've also picked up indie titles based on, you know, happened to going through Twitch and seeing people play, so.

192
00:16:08,074 --> 00:16:09,035
[SPEAKER_08]: Surgeon Simulator.

193
00:16:11,267 --> 00:16:14,970
[SPEAKER_08]: 2013.

194
00:16:12,308 --> 00:16:14,970
[SPEAKER_08]: That video, I had to buy it after watching that.

195
00:16:16,071 --> 00:16:33,047
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't think of one off the top of my head that I bought, but I will say that seeing streams convinced me to give Dota 2 a try and League of Legends, and I was kind of ignoring those, but because of all the streaming that goes on with that, I was kind of convinced like, oh, maybe I can try this too.

196
00:16:33,925 --> 00:16:35,627
[SPEAKER_06]: That's actually exactly the same point.

197
00:16:35,827 --> 00:16:48,219
[SPEAKER_06]: The last time I was out here, I watched The International 3 with some coworkers, and once Dota 2 was finally available for Steam on Mac, I jumped on that and had a couple friends teach me how to play the game.

198
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:58,849
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to say I'm good at it by any stretch of the imagination, but I'm to the point where I can actually learn on my own and sometimes hold up in multiplayer matches.

199
00:16:59,867 --> 00:17:07,734
[SPEAKER_07]: Going to our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com, SSJ100Matt says, I really just like watching my friends play games and occasionally do hilarious commentary.

200
00:17:08,435 --> 00:17:12,719
[SPEAKER_07]: AlanAlchemy with a comment that's teasing Gemet, which I'm always here for those.

201
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:20,005
[SPEAKER_07]: AlanAlchemy says, and how Gemet takes his hands off the mouse and keyboard and slaps him over his face and stops playing the game when he hasn't even died yet.

202
00:17:20,305 --> 00:17:22,087
[SPEAKER_07]: It's hilarious and infuriating.

203
00:17:23,914 --> 00:17:25,875
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to get a nasty call on Skype this week.

204
00:17:25,995 --> 00:17:27,375
[SPEAKER_01]: God damn it, Rob Roberts.

205
00:17:27,696 --> 00:17:30,697
[SPEAKER_01]: I heard OLR this week, Rob Roberts, and you were talking shit about me again.

206
00:17:30,977 --> 00:17:35,539
[SPEAKER_06]: The other side of the coin from this email is party games because party games don't have something that you can spoil.

207
00:17:35,699 --> 00:17:39,140
[SPEAKER_06]: You see something live stream that's really fun and you pick it up immediately.

208
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:39,660
[SPEAKER_06]: Good point.

209
00:17:40,181 --> 00:17:40,421
[SPEAKER_07]: Good point.

210
00:17:40,441 --> 00:17:43,602
[SPEAKER_07]: The first time I saw Mario U was on a live stream.

211
00:17:44,162 --> 00:17:47,964
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I didn't buy all that right when it first came out.

212
00:17:48,104 --> 00:17:50,225
[SPEAKER_07]: So I kind of saw it all like that morning.

213
00:17:52,365 --> 00:17:52,826
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.

214
00:17:53,046 --> 00:17:54,746
[SPEAKER_07]: Looking for more comments in our chat room.

215
00:17:54,926 --> 00:18:00,608
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkTetsuya at live.vognetwork.com says, To me it seems like the horror movie trailers or any trailer in general.

216
00:18:00,928 --> 00:18:04,449
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure, maybe you've seen some of the game, but there's still a good chunk that would surprise you.

217
00:18:05,489 --> 00:18:14,311
[SPEAKER_07]: BlackWolf, our good pal Bobby BlackWolf, who always does the show before us here at VOG Network, says, Well, I almost bought Final Fantasy XIV because of Sky's livestream.

218
00:18:14,691 --> 00:18:17,412
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm interested in Hearthstone because of his livestream.

219
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:20,013
[SPEAKER_06]: Interested and almost.

220
00:18:20,553 --> 00:18:30,077
[SPEAKER_06]: Actdeft actually said exactly the same thing that I wasn't even thinking about, is that you played Rogue Legacy, and I'll say this again once we hit our gaming weeks, but I've been playing a good chunk of that.

221
00:18:30,217 --> 00:18:32,398
[SPEAKER_06]: Every time I've seen that game, I've very much enjoyed it.

222
00:18:32,518 --> 00:18:33,419
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a good use of your time.

223
00:18:33,439 --> 00:18:34,059
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a great game.

224
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,500
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me read another comment here, just a couple more.

225
00:18:37,141 --> 00:18:45,924
[SPEAKER_07]: Duran in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, I usually use demos or betas to decide if I want to play a game, but this is a nice way if those options aren't available.

226
00:18:46,185 --> 00:18:46,905
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a very good point.

227
00:18:47,485 --> 00:19:13,819
[SPEAKER_07]: and lastly I'll say from Dungeon Buster here I was on the fence with Amnesia a while back until I watched a few streams of it and picked it up so I mean a lot of positive like yes the streaming might be doing more good than bad not to dismiss the points of the original email though but I think there is a little bit of both I think there's some of what the emailer was saying and I think there's the other side of yeah but there's also another audience that may not have bought the game that is going to buy the game now

228
00:19:14,179 --> 00:19:14,320
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

229
00:19:25,339 --> 00:19:28,080
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, anyhow, that'll do it for that topic.

230
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:29,241
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's get into our gaming weeks.

231
00:19:29,841 --> 00:19:36,925
[SPEAKER_03]: For the record, I actually do totally want to have people in person for a good Silent Hill 3 playthrough.

232
00:19:36,945 --> 00:19:37,725
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll be fun.

233
00:19:38,066 --> 00:19:38,546
[SPEAKER_07]: Good times.

234
00:19:39,927 --> 00:19:41,988
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, one comment I do need to respond to in chat.

235
00:19:42,008 --> 00:19:44,709
[SPEAKER_07]: Codeman says, Rob, have you played Outlast yet?

236
00:19:45,029 --> 00:19:45,870
[SPEAKER_07]: I have not.

237
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:48,051
[SPEAKER_07]: Codeman was kind enough to gift me a copy.

238
00:19:48,731 --> 00:19:51,873
[SPEAKER_07]: I will say time is running out for me to do that, though, because Halloween is this week.

239
00:19:52,233 --> 00:19:53,034
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura

240
00:20:09,484 --> 00:20:10,564
[SPEAKER_07]: You're not playing it right now.

241
00:20:10,684 --> 00:20:11,265
[SPEAKER_03]: No, not right now.

242
00:20:13,425 --> 00:20:14,306
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, Normandy's open.

243
00:20:15,826 --> 00:20:21,888
[SPEAKER_03]: I played Final Fantasy XIV, and I got on a quest that was really pissing me off, so I just said screw it and got my second job.

244
00:20:22,268 --> 00:20:32,071
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm at level 10 Thaumaturge, and when I hit 15, maybe tonight, I'll go back to spamming whatever I have to do as a sorcerer, maybe.

245
00:20:32,091 --> 00:20:33,712
[SPEAKER_03]: Not sorcerer, summoner, I guess.

246
00:20:33,852 --> 00:20:34,492
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how that works.

247
00:20:35,012 --> 00:20:38,840
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, so I'm playing that.

248
00:20:40,123 --> 00:20:43,029
[SPEAKER_03]: I got Gone Home, but I haven't started it yet.

249
00:20:43,169 --> 00:20:45,795
[SPEAKER_03]: Did I play some Super Mario 3D World Land?

250
00:20:45,975 --> 00:20:46,135
[SPEAKER_07]: Mm-hmm.

251
00:20:46,997 --> 00:20:47,517
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever it is.

252
00:20:47,537 --> 00:20:49,058
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, that's right, because you borrowed that from me last year.

253
00:20:49,118 --> 00:20:49,578
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I did.

254
00:20:49,779 --> 00:20:50,799
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever, 3D stuff.

255
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:52,580
[SPEAKER_03]: Without the 3D.

256
00:20:54,741 --> 00:21:05,887
[SPEAKER_03]: I also played some Fractal, and I've played Mass Effect 3, I've played the first Mass Effect, because I bought Chadi the first two games on PC, and she hasn't been able to get hers to work.

257
00:21:06,147 --> 00:21:06,688
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know why.

258
00:21:07,348 --> 00:21:11,951
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've been playing mine to walk her through getting all of her stuff set up.

259
00:21:12,911 --> 00:21:15,953
[SPEAKER_07]: And now that I'm in the game, I just can't resist rolling another Shepard.

260
00:21:15,973 --> 00:21:17,434
[SPEAKER_03]: I totally forgot where I was.

261
00:21:17,594 --> 00:21:27,179
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I have another Shepard that I'm playing as kind of the, let's see if we can get Garrus to go the specter path, which we know that doesn't really happen anyway, so whatever.

262
00:21:27,639 --> 00:21:28,180
[SPEAKER_03]: Spoilers!

263
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:33,963
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm playing that one, and I completely forgot where I was.

264
00:21:34,023 --> 00:21:35,063
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't even done, like...

265
00:21:36,284 --> 00:21:39,106
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I just finished Novaria and that's it.

266
00:21:40,047 --> 00:21:45,510
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was playing those and I was playing something else.

267
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:51,393
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Dan has broken out the GameCube and is playing the Mimish Cap.

268
00:21:52,574 --> 00:21:52,914
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, nice.

269
00:21:53,535 --> 00:21:55,596
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, we've had this game for how long?

270
00:21:55,956 --> 00:21:57,597
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've played it for not how long?

271
00:21:58,138 --> 00:21:58,878
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to play it.

272
00:21:58,938 --> 00:22:02,560
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's what all I've been hearing all morning is a mix of Animal Crossing music and the Mimish Cap.

273
00:22:04,121 --> 00:22:04,421
[SPEAKER_07]: Alrighty.

274
00:22:04,441 --> 00:22:04,982
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

275
00:22:05,475 --> 00:22:06,436
[SPEAKER_08]: There it is, your gaming week.

276
00:22:06,916 --> 00:22:07,176
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki!

277
00:22:08,297 --> 00:22:11,219
[SPEAKER_08]: I only play Grand Theft Auto V. What a shock!

278
00:22:11,519 --> 00:22:12,320
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, shocking.

279
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:19,405
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I've been still trying to go through single player and get 100%, so that's what I've been working on.

280
00:22:20,126 --> 00:22:27,111
[SPEAKER_08]: I finished the flight school stuff, even though I wanted to throw a controller when it came to some of the...

281
00:22:27,831 --> 00:22:29,012
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

282
00:22:48,288 --> 00:22:57,752
[SPEAKER_08]: I can go in and it actually updates as I get stuff so I know, okay, I have to go here, I have to do this, because no one really wants to just wander the map looking for that shit.

283
00:22:57,912 --> 00:23:02,193
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want it done immediately so I can get on to the next thing.

284
00:23:03,194 --> 00:23:10,537
[SPEAKER_08]: And then playing a little bit of online at work, mostly the PlayStation 3 version, so I'm level 17 in that now.

285
00:23:11,217 --> 00:23:13,758
[SPEAKER_08]: And another VOG Gaming Night, I think we're going to

286
00:23:14,258 --> 00:23:20,321
[SPEAKER_08]: Take turns on the Fridays, so we'll probably have one next Friday around 8 o'clock.

287
00:23:20,641 --> 00:23:22,942
[SPEAKER_08]: Haven't decided if it's going to be PS3 or 360 yet.

288
00:23:23,262 --> 00:23:26,584
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably 360, so stay tuned for that.

289
00:23:26,704 --> 00:23:28,665
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, of course, the following week we'll probably do PS3.

290
00:23:31,303 --> 00:23:31,643
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

291
00:23:32,064 --> 00:23:34,065
[SPEAKER_07]: So lots and lots of Grand Theft Auto 5.

292
00:23:34,586 --> 00:23:40,950
[SPEAKER_07]: And once again, if you want to join the VOG Club on Grand Theft Auto 5, all the information is in our forums at vognetwork.com.

293
00:23:40,971 --> 00:23:42,312
[SPEAKER_07]: Just click on forums at the top of the screen.

294
00:23:42,332 --> 00:23:44,813
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, socialclub.rockstargames.com.

295
00:23:45,714 --> 00:23:50,958
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think it's just slash crew slash vognetwork.

296
00:23:51,318 --> 00:23:53,760
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think last I checked, we had 46 people.

297
00:23:54,021 --> 00:23:54,221
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.

298
00:23:56,242 --> 00:23:57,703
[SPEAKER_08]: And we now have...

299
00:23:59,365 --> 00:23:59,785
[SPEAKER_08]: 50!

300
00:23:59,505 --> 00:23:59,785
[SPEAKER_08]: We hit 50.

301
00:24:00,526 --> 00:24:01,627
[SPEAKER_08]: Climbing.

302
00:24:02,087 --> 00:24:02,367
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.

303
00:24:03,028 --> 00:24:07,652
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, Jason, our guest here and voiceover guy, what have you been up to?

304
00:24:07,832 --> 00:24:09,614
[SPEAKER_06]: This map is really freaking amazing.

305
00:24:09,874 --> 00:24:18,301
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember when I learned that it was impossible to 100% Just Cause 2, that it would have been really nice to have something that just shows us where all the items are.

306
00:24:18,622 --> 00:24:24,487
[SPEAKER_06]: When you get to like a 90-90% completion rate where running all over the continent is just ridiculous...

307
00:24:24,955 --> 00:24:29,499
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah, I still have a few orbs I have to get in Crackdown, the first one.

308
00:24:29,559 --> 00:24:31,880
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, same problem.

309
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:35,923
[SPEAKER_06]: Crackdown is even smaller than Just Cause 2 is, but still, yeah.

310
00:24:35,943 --> 00:24:41,668
[SPEAKER_06]: Something like that that helps you to the most monotonous grinding possible would be incredibly beneficial.

311
00:24:42,948 --> 00:25:10,758
[SPEAKER_06]: as I said earlier I've been playing a ton of Rogue Legacy and ripping my hair out with that collectively as well as FTL Faster Than Light which has been frustrating because even on easy I can't make it all the way across the galaxy and I've been very disappointed of this constantly I mentioned on Twitter last night that I went out to a friend's house down in San Francisco and I played Artemis the Starship Bridge Simulator for the first time we played for something like

312
00:25:11,438 --> 00:25:12,980
[SPEAKER_06]: Four hours, you gave me a glance.

313
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,141
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you not heard of this before?

314
00:25:14,502 --> 00:25:15,863
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I have not, but it sounds interesting.

315
00:25:16,043 --> 00:25:23,852
[SPEAKER_06]: Artemis, I don't know what's new, what's old, but basically what it amounts to is that you have a starship, up to six of them, as a matter of fact.

316
00:25:25,093 --> 00:25:30,599
[SPEAKER_06]: You run either a server, or I think it's one server per ship, and you can have up to...

317
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:48,352
[SPEAKER_06]: 8 or 9 positions that encompass a starship bridge comms, helm, weapons, engineering, science that actually does like shield scanning and what not sector scanning and then obviously the captain is required I think you basically have to have at least 2 players but the more you have the better it is

318
00:25:49,232 --> 00:25:53,336
[SPEAKER_06]: and you start the game with a given scenario.

319
00:25:53,696 --> 00:26:07,547
[SPEAKER_06]: You have deep space stations, in our case DS1-4 to protect wormholes, space whales, minefields that you can use to your advantage or stop paying attention and destroy yourself very quickly.

320
00:26:08,007 --> 00:26:09,328
[SPEAKER_06]: It's an incredible amount of fun.

321
00:26:09,668 --> 00:26:13,373
[SPEAKER_07]: By the way, this game's getting a big response in our chatroom here at live.vognetwork.com.

322
00:26:13,393 --> 00:26:14,794
[SPEAKER_07]: BlackWolf says, I love Artemis.

323
00:26:15,435 --> 00:26:17,838
[SPEAKER_07]: Tim trips in chat and says, Artemis is so fun.

324
00:26:18,399 --> 00:26:20,761
[SPEAKER_07]: And SSJ100Matt says, Artemis is at PAX East, right?

325
00:26:21,562 --> 00:26:22,764
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it was.

326
00:26:22,884 --> 00:26:23,505
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't remember.

327
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:25,607
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't go, but I think it was one of those games.

328
00:26:25,767 --> 00:26:28,290
[SPEAKER_06]: I've seen a ton of footage and, you know, the places they can...

329
00:26:29,131 --> 00:26:35,994
[SPEAKER_06]: Take the main screen, the bridge screen and make it gigantic and have all of the stations situated strategically.

330
00:26:36,414 --> 00:26:43,458
[SPEAKER_06]: There's an immense amount of potential to take that game, make the experience as fun as possible and as good as you want it to be.

331
00:26:44,258 --> 00:26:47,660
[SPEAKER_07]: I am looking at footage of this game on YouTube that Bobby sent me.

332
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:48,200
[SPEAKER_07]: How about that?

333
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:50,201
[SPEAKER_07]: A Let's Play I'm using to look at the game.

334
00:26:50,681 --> 00:26:52,942
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah, this looks like they're having fun.

335
00:26:52,962 --> 00:26:56,143
[SPEAKER_07]: They're all kind of sitting around the table on all their little laptops yelling at each other.

336
00:26:56,724 --> 00:26:57,124
[SPEAKER_07]: That's cool.

337
00:26:58,030 --> 00:26:58,530
[SPEAKER_06]: and DarkSakura.

338
00:27:27,170 --> 00:27:28,370
[SPEAKER_07]: That sounds like a lot of fun.

339
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:29,691
[SPEAKER_07]: It is so fun.

340
00:27:29,751 --> 00:27:30,811
[SPEAKER_07]: I gotta be honest, though.

341
00:27:31,031 --> 00:27:42,074
[SPEAKER_07]: If they were to slap Star Trek onto this, I know I shouldn't say that because this is an indie game and let it grow and be its own thing, but I have to say, can you imagine if they could slap Star Trek onto this?

342
00:27:42,194 --> 00:27:44,574
[SPEAKER_07]: It would basically be a Star Trek LARP.

343
00:27:45,075 --> 00:27:46,635
[SPEAKER_07]: People would so be there.

344
00:27:46,655 --> 00:27:50,516
[SPEAKER_03]: They've tried doing console Star Trek games that just did not take off.

345
00:27:52,296 --> 00:27:53,817
[SPEAKER_03]: With the intent of being a simulator.

346
00:27:53,837 --> 00:27:54,037
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

347
00:27:54,957 --> 00:28:01,362
[SPEAKER_07]: well even Ragenator wants to know in our chat room does it help to say engage or make it so or speak like Shatner when playing Artemis?

348
00:28:02,642 --> 00:28:24,317
[SPEAKER_06]: the captain did not did not take the role of a particular character from any universe like that but I would use those words because I was doing Helm and so we would have the rotation of the ship and you can also have a warp or a jump ship jump being you instantly go to a certain place of course and warp that progressively

349
00:28:24,717 --> 00:28:25,638
[SPEAKER_06]: HighRateTraveling.

350
00:28:26,598 --> 00:28:34,621
[SPEAKER_06]: He'll give me coordinates, and I will say locked in or coordinates engaged or jump engaged, 10 seconds to jump, all that kind of stuff.

351
00:28:35,722 --> 00:28:40,604
[SPEAKER_06]: We had fun with it, and it kind of comes with the territory of us all being the geeks that we are.

352
00:28:40,744 --> 00:28:41,124
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course.

353
00:28:41,424 --> 00:28:44,626
[SPEAKER_06]: We didn't take specific characters, but we had a hell of a lot of fun with it.

354
00:28:45,346 --> 00:28:48,587
[SPEAKER_07]: Tim Tripp in our chatroom says, I basically pretend it's Star Trek anyways.

355
00:28:48,687 --> 00:28:49,448
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, it's not just me.

356
00:28:51,248 --> 00:29:01,212
[SPEAKER_06]: Revision 3 has a short little video of this game and they are all dressed up in Star Trek appropriate attire, uniforms and everything, color appropriate and the whole thing.

357
00:29:01,912 --> 00:29:09,295
[SPEAKER_06]: And I will say that our weapons individual was the space cowboy and he was playing that character very, very well.

358
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:19,032
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, I'm just cracking up at chat because Tim Drip follows up with saying, Practice is my best Janeway voice, which Extifer over at Horde House does this so much better than I do.

359
00:29:19,092 --> 00:29:23,673
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, that's all Tom Paris, Harry Kim, Harry Kim, Tom Paris, Tom Paris.

360
00:29:24,073 --> 00:29:26,353
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all he does is yell those two names over and over, but it's funny.

361
00:29:26,373 --> 00:29:27,493
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been watching through Voyager.

362
00:29:27,753 --> 00:29:28,754
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it was a good show.

363
00:29:28,794 --> 00:29:29,454
[SPEAKER_07]: It was underrated.

364
00:29:30,634 --> 00:29:31,274
[SPEAKER_07]: So, anyhow.

365
00:29:31,414 --> 00:29:31,674
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

366
00:29:31,874 --> 00:29:32,414
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

367
00:29:32,554 --> 00:29:32,774
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

368
00:29:33,615 --> 00:29:34,075
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it wasn't.

369
00:29:37,813 --> 00:30:07,003
[SPEAKER_03]: Voyager was full of bad decision after bad decision and Janeway going fuck it I'm Janeway we're in the middle of Delta space I don't have to follow shit and that's the tale of Voyager I'm not asking for directions I am the direction it's a real trip though to see Janeway on Orange is the New Black I'm just saying it's a different role for her okay anyhow oh shit that was her I didn't even realize it after watching no it didn't even click

370
00:30:09,213 --> 00:30:29,206
[SPEAKER_06]: and there's also McCoy on some cops SWAT something I saw a commercial for obviously Avonverse McCoy is on some new TV show and that's quite a jump I love you GameGuru because you know SF Debris if you ever want to see the funniest mockery of the Janeway voice ever go to SF Debris

371
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:33,626
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to say, you know, Voyager had some pretty epic guest stars.

372
00:30:33,666 --> 00:30:36,390
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, Sarah Silverman was a guest star on an episode of Voyager.

373
00:30:36,731 --> 00:30:40,617
[SPEAKER_07]: And, like, she wasn't being her typical, like, you know, over-the-top hilarity.

374
00:30:40,677 --> 00:30:41,859
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, she was playing it serious.

375
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:43,701
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's so funny to see her on the show.

376
00:30:44,142 --> 00:30:44,683
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, like...

377
00:30:45,945 --> 00:30:47,806
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going on the Voyager, huh?

378
00:30:48,087 --> 00:31:02,281
[SPEAKER_03]: I just can't help but think always though of Maria Bamford doing her I used to work at the Star Trek experience as a Bajoran her Bajoran refugee voice I can never get that out of my head whenever I think of Star Trek

379
00:31:02,881 --> 00:31:07,646
[SPEAKER_07]: Bobby Blackwolf says, I hear Orange is the new Black is better if you pretend it's just Janeway in the holodeck.

380
00:31:07,966 --> 00:31:09,107
[SPEAKER_07]: It could be your fantasy.

381
00:31:09,247 --> 00:31:09,768
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, look.

382
00:31:09,788 --> 00:31:12,670
[SPEAKER_07]: This is getting way too far away from video games.

383
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:13,531
[SPEAKER_07]: Way too far.

384
00:31:13,951 --> 00:31:16,293
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just the expanse of the Star Trek universe.

385
00:31:16,373 --> 00:31:18,175
[SPEAKER_07]: Look what this Artemis game does to people.

386
00:31:18,355 --> 00:31:19,957
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, I'm kidding.

387
00:31:20,117 --> 00:31:25,261
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we've also just admitted that we know way too much about Voyager than we should say in public.

388
00:31:26,682 --> 00:31:29,385
[SPEAKER_08]: I know nothing about Voyager other than you know

389
00:31:30,953 --> 00:31:34,877
[SPEAKER_03]: I will, however, watch an entire season of Voyager before I watch any more Enterprise.

390
00:31:34,997 --> 00:31:35,517
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

391
00:31:36,178 --> 00:31:39,762
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, true story, the first time I ever got drunk was at the Star Trek experience.

392
00:31:39,962 --> 00:31:42,985
[SPEAKER_07]: First time in my life I ever got drunk was at Warped Core Breach.

393
00:31:43,165 --> 00:31:43,946
[SPEAKER_07]: I love those things.

394
00:31:44,046 --> 00:31:48,731
[SPEAKER_07]: Fucking Travis over at Under Sedation Live here at VOG Network has the voicemail thing.

395
00:31:48,931 --> 00:31:51,134
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, long story that I'm not going to recap.

396
00:31:51,554 --> 00:31:54,895
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, I did find in Las Vegas a replacement for the Warp Core Breach.

397
00:31:55,135 --> 00:31:55,535
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, what's that?

398
00:31:55,815 --> 00:31:58,936
[SPEAKER_03]: It's at this place at the Paris Casino.

399
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:06,339
[SPEAKER_03]: Their little dessert bar, whatever place, has fuzzy drinks with foam coming up out of it like the Warp Core Breach.

400
00:32:06,879 --> 00:32:09,280
[SPEAKER_03]: And whatever their red one is tastes like a Warp Core Breach.

401
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:09,880
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

402
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,320
[SPEAKER_03]: I just don't remember what it was called.

403
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,601
[SPEAKER_03]: It was red and I was drunk.

404
00:32:13,141 --> 00:32:13,561
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.

405
00:32:13,821 --> 00:32:15,162
[SPEAKER_07]: I gotta go to Vegas one of these times.

406
00:32:15,562 --> 00:32:20,104
[SPEAKER_07]: A friend of mine is trying to talk me into going to New Media Expo, which I think is right around the time of CES.

407
00:32:20,304 --> 00:32:24,126
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's like, oh, if I could do a double and do both those cons, it'd be a lot of fun.

408
00:32:24,146 --> 00:32:28,307
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyway, let's talk about my gaming week and the type of stuff that I've been playing this week.

409
00:32:28,327 --> 00:32:32,729
[SPEAKER_07]: Which, you know, much like Loki, I still have been playing plenty of Final Fantasy XIV.

410
00:32:33,169 --> 00:32:39,132
[SPEAKER_07]: We perfected earlier today speedruns of Wanderer's Palace, which if you know the endgame, that's one of the instances that you can do in the endgame.

411
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:40,012
[SPEAKER_07]: Hotline Miami

412
00:32:57,057 --> 00:32:57,558
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

413
00:33:16,175 --> 00:33:16,636
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, Luke,

414
00:33:31,172 --> 00:33:35,413
[SPEAKER_07]: Very fast-paced game, and in the retro sense, I find a lot of it is about memorization.

415
00:33:35,773 --> 00:33:47,497
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, okay, here, you're going to go onto this floor in this house that you're invading for whatever reason, and I'm going to go kill that guy, and I'm going to take his weapon, and then go kill that guy, and that guy, and then I've got to run over here and lure that guy out.

416
00:33:48,177 --> 00:33:53,459
[SPEAKER_07]: You start to think of the memorization like it's a Mega Man level or something, like in retro.

417
00:33:53,599 --> 00:33:58,501
[SPEAKER_07]: I know it's a lot of trial and error, but unfortunately for me, I tend to error a lot more

418
00:33:59,861 --> 00:34:00,622
[SPEAKER_07]: Then I do succeed.

419
00:34:00,662 --> 00:34:04,884
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's something about the soundtrack of that game kind of like gets you going.

420
00:34:05,144 --> 00:34:06,225
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I want to play more of that.

421
00:34:06,245 --> 00:34:08,486
[SPEAKER_07]: So I was having a lot of fun with that on PlayStation 3.

422
00:34:09,027 --> 00:34:12,329
[SPEAKER_07]: So again, if you have PlayStation Plus, check it out.

423
00:34:12,449 --> 00:34:12,869
[SPEAKER_07]: It's free.

424
00:34:13,029 --> 00:34:14,470
[SPEAKER_07]: You really have no reason at this point.

425
00:34:15,330 --> 00:34:15,750
[SPEAKER_07]: Not two.

426
00:34:16,891 --> 00:34:36,638
[SPEAKER_07]: And even, I'm sure it'll be discounted on Steam, and I don't think it's a very expensive game to begin with on any of the platforms it's on, so it's worth the money if you like old retro puzzle memorization games, and if you like an abundance of violence with your retro games, because I will tell you, there's an abundance of violence in this game.

427
00:34:38,478 --> 00:35:05,010
[SPEAKER_07]: and Shooting Dogs Alan Alchemy in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com backing us up, it absolutely needs memorization to get through it alright, let's see other games that I've been playing this week I did play a game it's not a new game, but it's new to me it's called Midway Arcade Origins which is a retro game collection that's available, I think it's on 360 and PS3, don't know about Wii or Wii U, I don't think it's there, I think it's only on the others

428
00:35:07,012 --> 00:35:07,733
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's the thing.

429
00:35:07,793 --> 00:35:10,916
[SPEAKER_07]: The Midway game collection's kind of been done before.

430
00:35:11,376 --> 00:35:12,518
[SPEAKER_07]: And I actually rented this.

431
00:35:12,558 --> 00:35:13,138
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't buy it.

432
00:35:13,519 --> 00:35:18,944
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I was a little hesitant to buy it because, well, I already have Midway Arcade Treasures on PlayStation 2.

433
00:35:20,046 --> 00:35:21,647
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, there's three different volumes of it, right?

434
00:35:21,667 --> 00:35:22,548
[SPEAKER_07]: I have all three volumes.

435
00:35:22,849 --> 00:35:25,852
[SPEAKER_07]: So most of the games in this I already have in one way or another.

436
00:35:27,033 --> 00:35:45,946
[SPEAKER_07]: and I think they even had on the PlayStation 1 some of these games were available and it's kind of funny because some of these games we've seen before this generation Joust was an early $5 Xbox Live Arcade game and that's in the collection now for you know what you can probably find this for $19.99 on Amazon at this point or Gaming Stories buy this new

437
00:35:46,426 --> 00:35:48,087
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura.com

438
00:36:16,025 --> 00:36:16,226
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe.

439
00:36:16,246 --> 00:36:16,346
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe.

440
00:36:17,307 --> 00:36:17,727
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.

441
00:36:36,708 --> 00:36:38,789
[SPEAKER_03]: Just like Punch-Out isn't Mike Tyson anymore.

442
00:36:38,849 --> 00:36:39,209
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.

443
00:36:39,249 --> 00:36:43,191
[SPEAKER_07]: They gave him a mustache and just photoshopped his name out so now it's just super off-road or whatever.

444
00:36:43,672 --> 00:36:45,973
[SPEAKER_07]: But I had a lot of fun playing that game.

445
00:36:46,133 --> 00:36:51,876
[SPEAKER_07]: Although I will say it loses a little something when you don't have the steering wheel that you can just spin around uncontrollably.

446
00:36:52,256 --> 00:37:01,644
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember, like, they were totally fake steering wheels, and they had no stop on the left or the right side, so when you were a kid, you would just spin that thing like crazy when you're trying to turn around, and it was a lot of fun.

447
00:37:01,684 --> 00:37:11,112
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't translate the same way to the, you know, thumbsticks, but it's an awful lot of fun to kind of have that whole experience, because I don't remember an arcade-perfect version of that.

448
00:37:11,612 --> 00:37:15,296
[SPEAKER_07]: I know on the NES they had a version of that, but it was a little...

449
00:37:17,037 --> 00:37:17,557
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

450
00:37:37,671 --> 00:37:41,372
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkTetsuya and GameGuru both in our chatroom telling me that Midway Treasures 3 actually did have Super Off-Road in it.

451
00:37:57,837 --> 00:38:04,164
[SPEAKER_07]: I just don't remember that, and to be honest, I'm looking over at my collection, I actually have Midway Arcade Treasures 1 and 2, so I guess I never picked up 3.

452
00:38:04,704 --> 00:38:07,187
[SPEAKER_07]: 3 had Hydro Thunder, and it was all racing games, right?

453
00:38:07,527 --> 00:38:09,209
[SPEAKER_07]: I wonder why I skipped that one.

454
00:38:09,389 --> 00:38:16,617
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember having to seek out 3 on the PS2 for a very specific purpose, and I don't think it was off-road, but I know there was some other game that I wanted in it.

455
00:38:16,983 --> 00:38:20,224
[SPEAKER_07]: So anyway, as far as retro classic game collections go, it's fine.

456
00:38:20,884 --> 00:38:23,725
[SPEAKER_07]: Especially if you don't have these games already in one way or the other.

457
00:38:24,065 --> 00:38:25,346
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of neat to have them again.

458
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:28,347
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, they've got the leaderboard and the trophies.

459
00:38:28,467 --> 00:38:29,407
[SPEAKER_07]: That's that.

460
00:38:29,767 --> 00:38:31,688
[SPEAKER_07]: Otherwise, not a lot to scream about.

461
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:37,390
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you're a retro gaming fan, it's really nice to see them in the crisp HD.

462
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:39,711
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can put different filters on the graphics too.

463
00:38:39,751 --> 00:38:41,671
[SPEAKER_07]: You can have it super sharp or smooth.

464
00:38:42,332 --> 00:38:43,432
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can do those little things.

465
00:38:44,492 --> 00:39:06,443
[SPEAKER_07]: and you know especially now that the title is a budget title it's it would be worth your time if you like retro games anyhow that does it for my gaming week so let's quickly do some housekeeping don't forget you can add us on twitter twitter.com slash olr and we're also on facebook facebook.com slash orange lounge radio we appreciate all our friends on those sites we're also on google plus as we'll get to later in the show

466
00:39:08,184 --> 00:39:26,660
[SPEAKER_07]: and I do want to remind you guys I mentioned this last week and just want to remind you guys there will be no new show in two weeks we will have the night off so we'll be here next week on November 3rd if I'm thinking right with the dates but we will not be here on November 10th because I will be coming back from Los Angeles and my not BlizzCon trip

467
00:39:27,193 --> 00:39:28,994
[SPEAKER_03]: and I get to trash your house.

468
00:39:29,354 --> 00:39:31,614
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura will be house sitting and kitty sitting.

469
00:39:31,995 --> 00:39:32,935
[SPEAKER_03]: I got paid in Duffy.

470
00:39:33,375 --> 00:39:35,015
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, as she kindly offered to do.

471
00:39:36,276 --> 00:39:37,156
[SPEAKER_07]: I would have done it for free.

472
00:39:37,336 --> 00:39:37,636
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.

473
00:39:37,816 --> 00:39:38,417
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for the Duffy.

474
00:39:38,577 --> 00:39:38,977
[SPEAKER_07]: You're welcome.

475
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:40,817
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been sitting on that for like three months.

476
00:39:41,578 --> 00:39:41,638
[SPEAKER_07]: Ow!

477
00:39:43,158 --> 00:39:44,960
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

478
00:40:01,918 --> 00:40:06,863
[SPEAKER_07]: So I said, fine, I'll go to BlizzCon, except there's no way I can get a ticket now.

479
00:40:07,664 --> 00:40:09,946
[SPEAKER_07]: BlizzCon is a fortress to get in as media.

480
00:40:09,966 --> 00:40:11,327
[SPEAKER_07]: You're either on their list or you're not.

481
00:40:11,728 --> 00:40:16,492
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm just going to go to the parties and then go to Disneyland, which is BlizzCon enough, right?

482
00:40:16,512 --> 00:40:16,593
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

483
00:40:17,253 --> 00:40:17,713
[SPEAKER_03]: Discon.

484
00:40:34,662 --> 00:40:36,124
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

485
00:40:50,922 --> 00:41:06,189
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm gonna be at an event called World of Podcasts which is Thursday night I'll be there I'm not featured because again I wasn't planning on going so I missed the boat on all that stuff but Grandpa from our show is on one of the panels over there so yeah I'll be at World of Podcasts so if you're gonna be there come say hi

486
00:41:07,009 --> 00:41:33,596
[SPEAKER_07]: and say hi to Grandpa as well and then I don't know whatever else I get invited to Friday or Saturday we'll go to that too although Alan and I are going to try to do a Carthay Circle dinner one of those nights so probably Saturday night because I think that's when the closing ceremonies are so there's usually not a lot going around because they usually have a big old concert although they didn't announce any like big there's no like Ozzy Osbourne or anything this year so I don't know what they're doing for the closing ceremonies it's got to be a secret so all right it's a secret to everybody it is a secret to everybody

487
00:41:34,349 --> 00:41:38,672
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, let's move on with some gaming news.

488
00:41:38,993 --> 00:41:40,594
[SPEAKER_07]: And Loki, gonna start us off tonight.

489
00:41:40,953 --> 00:41:52,397
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, there's a rumor that's, I guess, going on saying that there's going to be a brand new... Sorry, you know it's a slow gaming week when we have to start off, or a slow news week in gaming when we have to start off with a rumor.

490
00:41:52,637 --> 00:41:56,558
[SPEAKER_07]: So I apologize in advance, but it's not the best week in news.

491
00:41:56,698 --> 00:41:58,119
[SPEAKER_08]: There's nothing to talk about.

492
00:41:58,579 --> 00:41:59,519
[SPEAKER_07]: We're stretching tonight.

493
00:41:59,539 --> 00:42:00,520
[SPEAKER_07]: Fully admitting.

494
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:01,580
[SPEAKER_08]: Fully admitting.

495
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:09,583
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, listen, I'm not covering that story about, you know, NASCAR being, you know, the rights for NASCAR going to Deep Silver because no one fucking cares.

496
00:42:12,665 --> 00:42:18,389
[SPEAKER_03]: I know there's Ragnar out there who still has his gaming console that he stole.

497
00:42:18,809 --> 00:42:25,294
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's this series that I guess they're calling Reimagined because that's dumb.

498
00:42:26,055 --> 00:42:32,344
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, it's supposed to be, I guess, seven Nintendo 64 games that are being redone in HD.

499
00:42:33,486 --> 00:42:40,677
[SPEAKER_08]: And, God, I hope they're really actually redoing everything if they're actually going to do this and not just up-resing them because it's going to look like shit.

500
00:42:41,158 --> 00:42:44,261
[SPEAKER_08]: It's also going to look weird too because they're not going to be all fuzzy and cloudy anymore.

501
00:42:45,542 --> 00:42:51,107
[SPEAKER_08]: They're also saying that all seven games would feature new content and retail at $30.

502
00:42:52,248 --> 00:42:59,254
[SPEAKER_08]: The idea is Nintendo would be filling the gaps in their Wii U lineup by re-releasing older Nintendo 64 games.

503
00:43:00,655 --> 00:43:27,611
[SPEAKER_08]: here's kind of funny part though about that is they are already filling well I should say their lineup is already including older games that are being remade like Wind Waker HD for example or you know even before the Wii U they had their new play control games which they literally did nothing to except for change the control on it you know oh hey now it uses a Wii remote instead of you know GameCube controller because that's so much better it's not

504
00:43:30,874 --> 00:43:34,478
[SPEAKER_08]: And yeah, one of the rumors, of course, is that Mario 64 is going to be the first game.

505
00:43:34,518 --> 00:43:36,240
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, it's going to be Mario 64.

506
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:38,522
[SPEAKER_08]: They're not going to do Superman 64.

507
00:43:38,822 --> 00:43:40,864
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, let's leave with that.

508
00:43:41,445 --> 00:43:44,588
[SPEAKER_07]: Mario Kart 64 would cannibalize a little bit of Mario Kart 8.

509
00:43:44,708 --> 00:43:49,413
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think... I mean, I could see them doing something like this, but I would think of anything...

510
00:43:50,674 --> 00:44:19,035
[SPEAKER_08]: I just don't know how much of a draw there's really going to be for people to get HD versions of these games I'm sure some people will be interested in but I don't know I would think they'd be better off just doing like I could see this maybe for the 3DS because remember they did this with Ocarina and Star Fox and that kind of stuff I could see that happening but

511
00:44:21,317 --> 00:44:21,717
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

512
00:44:21,777 --> 00:44:22,898
[SPEAKER_08]: It just sounds like a rumor to me.

513
00:44:23,098 --> 00:44:23,458
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever.

514
00:44:25,879 --> 00:44:33,422
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I realize it's a big old rumor, and Nintendo remaking their games wouldn't exactly be out of character for them or whatever, right?

515
00:44:33,442 --> 00:44:34,022
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, yeah.

516
00:44:34,143 --> 00:44:42,026
[SPEAKER_07]: But it seems like it's not a very long process for them, and the games turn out pretty well received.

517
00:44:42,206 --> 00:44:43,847
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm thinking of the Zelda or Wind Waker HD 30s.

518
00:44:44,687 --> 00:44:51,909
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but the problem with Wind Waker HD, though, is that it had way better graphics than, you know, the GameCube... Well, because it was a GameCube game.

519
00:44:51,950 --> 00:44:56,711
[SPEAKER_08]: It wasn't that different than, you know, a regular Wii game or something like that.

520
00:44:56,731 --> 00:44:59,972
[SPEAKER_08]: So it wasn't... They weren't doing a whole lot.

521
00:45:00,252 --> 00:45:08,015
[SPEAKER_08]: Whereas if you were doing Mario or like any of the Nintendo 64 stuff, you're going to have to do quite a bit to that to make it look nice.

522
00:45:08,395 --> 00:45:13,477
[SPEAKER_08]: Because just up-resing it and making the polys look nicer and stuff...

523
00:45:13,877 --> 00:45:23,023
[SPEAKER_08]: It's gonna look like, I mean, fuck, you can just pull it up on YouTube and look at any of the emulators out there that do any sort of upscaling on that stuff, and it just, it doesn't look that good.

524
00:45:23,303 --> 00:45:41,314
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, even when I ran stuff in, like, an emulator on, like, the Ouya and stuff, and that sort of did some uprising and stuff, it just doesn't look good on your TV, because, yeah, everything's smoother looking, but it's just so empty, because those games, you know, couldn't, they couldn't do very far draw distances, or, you know, they didn't have a lot of detail in there, because...

525
00:45:42,114 --> 00:45:43,155
[SPEAKER_08]: It couldn't handle it.

526
00:45:43,735 --> 00:45:45,416
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just, I don't know.

527
00:45:46,696 --> 00:45:49,938
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a neat idea, but I just don't know how well it's going to look.

528
00:45:50,918 --> 00:45:51,679
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see, I guess.

529
00:45:52,359 --> 00:45:59,943
[SPEAKER_07]: SSJ100Matt with a comment in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com The recent Mario Kart games have had the older tracks remade into the new games.

530
00:45:59,983 --> 00:46:02,804
[SPEAKER_07]: That's another good reason why Mario Kart 64 would be a little redundant.

531
00:46:02,844 --> 00:46:11,051
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, you know, as much as I like playing the older tracks, I think that's such a cop-out of like, hey, look, we can double the content now without having to do anything.

532
00:46:11,071 --> 00:46:15,134
[SPEAKER_07]: I do think they could release a bunch of old tracks as DLC.

533
00:46:15,375 --> 00:46:16,376
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that would be really cool.

534
00:46:17,577 --> 00:46:18,017
[SPEAKER_08]: Why not?

535
00:46:18,217 --> 00:46:20,939
[SPEAKER_08]: Why not have the balls and put a fucking track editor in there?

536
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:25,043
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, you afraid that people are going to come up with better track designs than your own?

537
00:46:25,203 --> 00:46:28,446
[SPEAKER_07]: But Loki, somebody might draw a penis as a track.

538
00:46:29,167 --> 00:46:29,527
[SPEAKER_03]: Not me.

539
00:46:29,987 --> 00:46:31,928
[SPEAKER_03]: I've decided I know what track I would design.

540
00:46:32,029 --> 00:46:32,409
[SPEAKER_07]: Boobs.

541
00:46:32,829 --> 00:46:33,749
[SPEAKER_03]: No, even better.

542
00:46:33,909 --> 00:46:34,110
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

543
00:46:34,570 --> 00:46:36,551
[SPEAKER_03]: I would have the full-on vag track.

544
00:46:36,971 --> 00:46:38,952
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, with a little loop.

545
00:46:38,972 --> 00:46:41,133
[SPEAKER_07]: See, I knew you were dirtying it up somewhere.

546
00:46:41,633 --> 00:46:42,114
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, come on.

547
00:46:42,994 --> 00:46:48,437
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's totally unfair to automatically assume that people are going to put a penis in when it is much better to put a vag in.

548
00:46:48,477 --> 00:46:49,337
[SPEAKER_03]: My next guess was boobs.

549
00:46:49,377 --> 00:46:50,098
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll tell you why.

550
00:46:50,198 --> 00:46:52,919
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll tell you why it's easy for people to put a penis in there.

551
00:46:52,939 --> 00:46:55,360
[SPEAKER_08]: Because who is the demographic for these games?

552
00:46:55,621 --> 00:46:57,842
[SPEAKER_08]: Teenage boys and pre-pubescent boys.

553
00:46:58,582 --> 00:46:59,482
[SPEAKER_08]: What have they seen?

554
00:46:59,743 --> 00:47:00,743
[SPEAKER_08]: They've seen their penis.

555
00:47:00,943 --> 00:47:01,803
[SPEAKER_08]: What have they not seen?

556
00:47:02,024 --> 00:47:03,384
[SPEAKER_08]: They have not seen a vagina.

557
00:47:03,504 --> 00:47:05,625
[SPEAKER_02]: And this would be the only way they ever would.

558
00:47:07,826 --> 00:47:10,147
[SPEAKER_08]: I would be doing them a favor.

559
00:47:10,767 --> 00:47:11,928
[SPEAKER_08]: It's familiar territory.

560
00:47:12,068 --> 00:47:15,189
[SPEAKER_08]: You didn't see fucking Bob Ross painting buildings and cars.

561
00:47:15,369 --> 00:47:17,811
[SPEAKER_08]: You saw him painting trees because that's what he knew.

562
00:47:17,991 --> 00:47:18,771
[SPEAKER_08]: He knew trees.

563
00:47:19,151 --> 00:47:21,492
[SPEAKER_08]: Just like kids, they know penises.

564
00:47:22,252 --> 00:47:25,474
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to be technical, it had to do with his painting style, but that's a different thing.

565
00:47:26,618 --> 00:47:28,659
[SPEAKER_08]: Goddammit, I want to see a fuzzy fucking building.

566
00:47:29,039 --> 00:47:31,460
[SPEAKER_07]: He can do it.

567
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:32,200
[SPEAKER_07]: From the grave.

568
00:47:32,220 --> 00:47:33,321
[SPEAKER_07]: I approve of this.

569
00:47:33,341 --> 00:47:34,701
[SPEAKER_07]: It will officially be called the Vulva Vroom.

570
00:47:42,598 --> 00:47:43,058
[SPEAKER_07]: Coach Buzzcut.

571
00:47:43,079 --> 00:47:43,299
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

572
00:47:43,319 --> 00:47:43,399
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

573
00:48:11,179 --> 00:48:18,545
[SPEAKER_08]: Kick me in the jibby So is that like, you know, like Mario teaches typing, it's Birdo teaches sex ed or something like that?

574
00:48:20,967 --> 00:48:38,042
[SPEAKER_07]: Teaching, this is all the stuff that I didn't want and I had it changed So you could even have it on the Wii U You could be like, now touch where you're gonna find the G spot And then the person touches, no, this is why you'll never get laid

575
00:48:39,031 --> 00:48:48,923
[SPEAKER_03]: show me on the touchpad where they touched you you get the orgasm trophy they don't have trophies on Wii U, DarkSakura well I don't have a Wii U so I don't care and

576
00:48:55,225 --> 00:48:56,666
[SPEAKER_07]: Was there more with that, Loki?

577
00:48:56,706 --> 00:48:57,066
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.

578
00:48:57,286 --> 00:49:00,228
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I cut you off and suddenly we went into... No, we were done talking.

579
00:49:00,348 --> 00:49:02,510
[SPEAKER_07]: We were in playground chat at that point.

580
00:49:02,530 --> 00:49:03,310
[SPEAKER_08]: We were done talking.

581
00:49:03,350 --> 00:49:04,471
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a rumor.

582
00:49:04,551 --> 00:49:05,392
[SPEAKER_08]: Rumor, rumor, rumor.

583
00:49:05,412 --> 00:49:06,372
[SPEAKER_08]: Rumor, rumor, rumor.

584
00:49:06,492 --> 00:49:11,335
[SPEAKER_06]: There's another joke there about the name of the game and for some strange reason I just can't put the words together.

585
00:49:11,936 --> 00:49:13,377
[SPEAKER_06]: Something, something, and we use...

586
00:49:14,757 --> 00:49:15,698
[SPEAKER_07]: What was the name of this?

587
00:49:15,958 --> 00:49:16,998
[SPEAKER_07]: Re-U-Magined?

588
00:49:17,078 --> 00:49:18,079
[SPEAKER_06]: Re-U-Magined, yes.

589
00:49:18,099 --> 00:49:18,819
[SPEAKER_07]: Re-U-Magined.

590
00:49:19,279 --> 00:49:22,600
[SPEAKER_07]: It honestly sounds like a special episode of RuPaul's Drag Race.

591
00:49:23,221 --> 00:49:24,781
[SPEAKER_07]: Like Ru-U-Magined or something.

592
00:49:24,821 --> 00:49:27,563
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that what the Lost episodes, what they're calling that on TV right now?

593
00:49:28,183 --> 00:49:29,583
[SPEAKER_03]: You know I've never watched an episode of that.

594
00:49:30,504 --> 00:49:31,204
[SPEAKER_06]: The Ru-vibed episode.

595
00:49:31,224 --> 00:49:32,485
[SPEAKER_03]: How are we friends?

596
00:49:33,245 --> 00:49:34,085
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean to.

597
00:49:34,466 --> 00:49:35,406
[SPEAKER_03]: I used to watch Drag U.

598
00:49:36,195 --> 00:49:37,215
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, okay, well, similar.

599
00:49:37,636 --> 00:49:38,236
[SPEAKER_07]: Then you know enough.

600
00:49:38,436 --> 00:49:43,238
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I like seeing, as much as Rue makes a gorgeous woman, I loved the suits.

601
00:49:44,018 --> 00:49:44,939
[SPEAKER_03]: It was all about the suits.

602
00:49:45,339 --> 00:49:46,079
[SPEAKER_03]: That red suit.

603
00:49:46,619 --> 00:49:56,203
[SPEAKER_07]: Tim Tripp in our chat says, I just had a moment where I thought I was listening to Horde House, but we didn't have Grandpa say something racially insensitive, so it's not truly an episode of Horde House at this point.

604
00:49:56,323 --> 00:49:58,524
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's move on quickly before we go there.

605
00:49:58,544 --> 00:50:01,625
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I'm just channeling exta for an entirely feminine manner.

606
00:50:03,226 --> 00:50:05,128
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't brought up bleaching the parts.

607
00:50:05,788 --> 00:50:09,531
[SPEAKER_07]: Next story is about Nintendo as well.

608
00:50:09,911 --> 00:50:12,053
[SPEAKER_07]: Talking about cross-play titles.

609
00:50:12,533 --> 00:50:17,877
[SPEAKER_07]: Right now, most cross-play we think of on PlayStation with PS3 or 4 and the PlayStation Vita.

610
00:50:18,157 --> 00:50:20,819
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, Hotline Miami, I was talking about earlier in the show.

611
00:50:21,079 --> 00:50:24,482
[SPEAKER_07]: When you download that, you get a Vita version and a PlayStation 3 version.

612
00:50:25,342 --> 00:50:27,684
[SPEAKER_07]: All your saves transfer through the cloud.

613
00:50:27,724 --> 00:50:28,705
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all through the cloud.

614
00:50:29,105 --> 00:50:29,726
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

615
00:50:50,164 --> 00:50:57,607
[SPEAKER_08]: Virtual Console on the Wii U because it has two screens and the same damn controls and you can fucking do any 3DS game on there.

616
00:50:58,147 --> 00:50:59,267
[SPEAKER_08]: They're just not doing it yet.

617
00:50:59,948 --> 00:51:03,569
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, well Nintendo has come out and said, quote, I almost said Vita.

618
00:51:11,952 --> 00:51:15,095
[SPEAKER_07]: as well as other video game systems not made by Nintendo.

619
00:51:15,696 --> 00:51:25,206
[SPEAKER_07]: And the reasoning behind that, just so you know, this is because of pure chess, which you can actually play on the Wii U, but you can also cross-play with PlayStation 3 and Vita.

620
00:51:25,606 --> 00:51:33,314
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, the reason why this is news is because this is a huge reason why you do not see Final Fantasy XIV on the Xbox 360.

621
00:51:34,355 --> 00:51:41,483
[SPEAKER_07]: Square wanted to put it on the 360, but Microsoft said, no, we will not support the cross-play element.

622
00:51:41,783 --> 00:51:45,547
[SPEAKER_07]: You will not be able to... Xbox has to be its own server, its own world and everything.

623
00:51:45,667 --> 00:51:53,175
[SPEAKER_07]: Xbox will not cross-play, which is funny because Final Fantasy XI was totally not like that and had play-online...

624
00:51:54,016 --> 00:52:09,388
[SPEAKER_07]: but you have to go back a few years Microsoft was desperate to have a Final Fantasy game on the 360 so they broke their own rule in that case only and that's why you got 13 later on on the 360 which was controversial but I digress back to Nintendo

625
00:52:10,169 --> 00:52:10,709
[SPEAKER_07]: Smash Brothers.

626
00:52:10,729 --> 00:52:11,310
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, not cross systems.

627
00:52:34,941 --> 00:52:38,444
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't think that the Wii U had an online portion for Disney Infinity.

628
00:52:39,444 --> 00:52:42,887
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I know they were... I think it maybe was limited to two players only.

629
00:52:44,348 --> 00:52:49,571
[SPEAKER_07]: But I thought that that was something that was taken out of... I can't speak firsthand because I haven't played Disney Infinity.

630
00:52:49,591 --> 00:52:50,632
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe I'm thinking the Wii version.

631
00:52:50,672 --> 00:52:51,573
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not aware of that.

632
00:52:51,613 --> 00:52:56,096
[SPEAKER_07]: I think you're thinking of either the regular Wii version, but I think the Wii U is comparable to the other systems.

633
00:52:56,716 --> 00:52:59,138
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't think that's... Maybe somebody in chat knows.

634
00:52:59,158 --> 00:53:01,039
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it's nice that different consoles play together.

635
00:53:01,059 --> 00:53:01,340
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean...

636
00:53:02,060 --> 00:53:02,460
[SPEAKER_08]: TV, TV, TV, TV

637
00:53:19,726 --> 00:53:21,428
[SPEAKER_07]: What can you do by moving your hand?

638
00:53:21,488 --> 00:53:22,809
[SPEAKER_07]: You can... Anyone?

639
00:53:22,869 --> 00:53:23,090
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyone?

640
00:53:23,150 --> 00:53:23,390
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyone?

641
00:53:23,430 --> 00:53:24,631
[SPEAKER_07]: You can Skype?

642
00:53:24,651 --> 00:53:25,452
[SPEAKER_07]: Flip off the characters?

643
00:53:26,012 --> 00:53:26,373
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.

644
00:53:26,493 --> 00:53:26,813
[SPEAKER_07]: Skype.

645
00:53:27,354 --> 00:53:29,836
[SPEAKER_07]: But isn't Skype cross-platform by default?

646
00:53:30,436 --> 00:53:31,858
[SPEAKER_07]: I can Skype on my iPhone.

647
00:53:32,238 --> 00:53:33,780
[SPEAKER_07]: I can Skype on my computer.

648
00:53:34,020 --> 00:53:36,903
[SPEAKER_07]: And what's... So why is Skype okay?

649
00:53:37,023 --> 00:53:38,344
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it because it's a Microsoft product?

650
00:53:38,364 --> 00:53:38,684
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

651
00:53:39,125 --> 00:53:41,006
[SPEAKER_07]: Why is Skype okay when all this other stuff isn't?

652
00:53:41,046 --> 00:53:41,767
[SPEAKER_07]: It is Microsoft.

653
00:53:41,907 --> 00:53:42,588
[SPEAKER_07]: Microsoft bought Skype.

654
00:53:42,928 --> 00:53:44,669
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it is now.

655
00:53:44,769 --> 00:53:46,529
[SPEAKER_06]: Obviously, it didn't start as one for a long time.

656
00:53:47,209 --> 00:53:49,470
[SPEAKER_06]: It's touting Skype.

657
00:53:49,870 --> 00:53:54,031
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you can Skype your other Xbox One plane-owning individuals.

658
00:53:54,151 --> 00:53:56,972
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's just the same voice and video chat they've already had on their network.

659
00:53:57,092 --> 00:54:00,013
[SPEAKER_07]: If you go to Skype.com, you have that whole Metro look.

660
00:54:01,374 --> 00:54:10,406
[SPEAKER_07]: And to go on yet another tangent away from what the story was supposed to be about, but I can't help myself, Skype, very controversial patch coming soon to Skype.

661
00:54:10,586 --> 00:54:16,694
[SPEAKER_07]: And the 6.1 patch that's due out in December, they are going to block third-party apps.

662
00:54:17,535 --> 00:54:24,180
[SPEAKER_07]: and this is very controversial because many people record their podcasts over Skype using a program like CallGraph.

663
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:28,082
[SPEAKER_07]: We actually did Horde House with that for a while or Pamela, I think one is called.

664
00:54:28,422 --> 00:54:31,825
[SPEAKER_07]: There's all these different programs people use in Skype to do their podcasts.

665
00:54:32,165 --> 00:54:35,207
[SPEAKER_07]: They're going to be screwed because Skype is disabling access to this.

666
00:54:35,407 --> 00:54:45,434
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I've kind of figured you would have meant things like there's a lot of instant messaging apps that can use Skype for text messaging but not voice and video calls.

667
00:54:45,822 --> 00:54:49,144
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so it's a very controversial thing going into effect.

668
00:54:49,444 --> 00:54:50,504
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Xbox One.

669
00:55:04,611 --> 00:55:06,032
[SPEAKER_07]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

670
00:55:33,105 --> 00:55:34,547
[SPEAKER_03]: My old laptop had all that too.

671
00:55:34,627 --> 00:55:38,372
[SPEAKER_03]: That's actually how I used to record BBC Radio 1.

672
00:55:38,492 --> 00:55:39,033
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

673
00:55:39,313 --> 00:55:40,434
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd record interviews off of that.

674
00:55:40,615 --> 00:55:40,815
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

675
00:55:41,195 --> 00:55:41,536
[SPEAKER_07]: Very nice.

676
00:55:41,916 --> 00:55:43,578
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah, Nintendo Crossplay.

677
00:55:47,603 --> 00:55:48,945
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's a good thing.

678
00:55:48,985 --> 00:55:49,125
[SPEAKER_07]: And I...

679
00:55:50,747 --> 00:55:52,468
[SPEAKER_07]: You know who does Nintendo best?

680
00:55:53,188 --> 00:55:53,729
[SPEAKER_07]: Nintendo.

681
00:55:54,089 --> 00:55:57,572
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm looking forward to seeing what they do with this.

682
00:55:57,672 --> 00:56:00,554
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think Smash Brothers seems like the obvious candidate.

683
00:56:01,014 --> 00:56:04,957
[SPEAKER_07]: What's going to be that synergy between the 3DS and the Wii U version that we don't know about yet?

684
00:56:04,997 --> 00:56:06,518
[SPEAKER_07]: There's definitely going to be something there.

685
00:56:06,979 --> 00:56:07,499
[SPEAKER_07]: What is it?

686
00:56:08,279 --> 00:56:08,740
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't know yet.

687
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:10,941
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll find out.

688
00:56:11,322 --> 00:56:12,222
[SPEAKER_07]: There's that part of me...

689
00:56:13,183 --> 00:56:32,734
[SPEAKER_07]: tinfoil hat mode going a very similar direction to what Loki's saying is that oh well you know soon you're gonna be able to play 3DS games on the Wii U I kind of think because you know we got the 2DS this year which you know it's a thing it's a new system did I tell you I played one of those this week I don't think I did one of my friends has a 2DS and I played the 2DS this week

690
00:56:33,938 --> 00:56:41,248
[SPEAKER_07]: Next year, we ought to be due for some type of new handheld out of Nintendo, right?

691
00:56:41,569 --> 00:56:45,634
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, even though we don't need one per se, that isn't going to stop them from making one.

692
00:56:46,235 --> 00:56:50,761
[SPEAKER_07]: What if they make some type of 3DS that can double as, wait for it, a Wii U touchpad?

693
00:56:52,025 --> 00:56:55,931
[SPEAKER_07]: because there's all the outcry out there for how can I buy a second touchpad?

694
00:56:55,972 --> 00:56:56,432
[SPEAKER_07]: How can I do it?

695
00:56:56,512 --> 00:56:58,456
[SPEAKER_07]: What if the second touchpad is a 3DS?

696
00:56:58,656 --> 00:57:01,721
[SPEAKER_06]: We also need something in the portable consoles that supports the Nintendo Network.

697
00:57:02,042 --> 00:57:02,342
[SPEAKER_06]: Why not?

698
00:57:02,403 --> 00:57:03,725
[SPEAKER_06]: Because the 3DS still does front codes.

699
00:57:06,182 --> 00:57:07,942
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, but at least it's a universal friend code.

700
00:57:08,002 --> 00:57:08,182
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.

701
00:57:08,582 --> 00:57:11,964
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I mean, the system's a hell of a lot better than the original DS.

702
00:57:12,004 --> 00:57:15,465
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just the fact that we haven't seen an firmware update yet.

703
00:57:15,685 --> 00:57:19,446
[SPEAKER_06]: Obviously, we still can in the next year, but especially for Smash Bros.

704
00:57:19,926 --> 00:57:27,249
[SPEAKER_06]: and what they want to continue to do down the road, their portable system needs to come in line and start supporting these same things that the Wii U does.

705
00:57:28,056 --> 00:57:32,100
[SPEAKER_07]: Codeman in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, Rob, is the screen too small?

706
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:33,341
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't have to be.

707
00:57:33,481 --> 00:57:36,864
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm not saying they're going to make this giant 3DS as big as one of those touchpads.

708
00:57:37,244 --> 00:57:38,305
[SPEAKER_07]: What has to be the same?

709
00:57:38,505 --> 00:57:41,168
[SPEAKER_07]: The resolution has to be the same, not the size.

710
00:57:42,566 --> 00:57:44,828
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's very possible that could happen.

711
00:57:45,969 --> 00:57:48,130
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm tinfoil hatting and making shit up, admittedly.

712
00:57:48,471 --> 00:57:48,791
[SPEAKER_07]: Why not?

713
00:57:48,831 --> 00:57:51,973
[SPEAKER_07]: It's rumor week on OLR because it's that week in gaming news.

714
00:57:52,053 --> 00:57:52,674
[SPEAKER_07]: So there you go.

715
00:57:53,515 --> 00:57:54,876
[SPEAKER_07]: It's rumor week.

716
00:57:55,016 --> 00:57:56,057
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right, rumors.

717
00:57:56,757 --> 00:58:02,302
[SPEAKER_07]: Some other podcasters in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com with some advice for people that are going to get screwed with the Skype changes.

718
00:58:03,302 --> 00:58:06,805
[SPEAKER_07]: Ranma says, use a USB mixer and audition for podcasting.

719
00:58:07,385 --> 00:58:09,087
[SPEAKER_07]: Blackwolf says, I use two sound cards.

720
00:58:09,627 --> 00:58:11,269
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's other ways to do it.

721
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:14,322
[SPEAKER_07]: Alrighty, let's move on with some more news.

722
00:58:14,362 --> 00:58:14,842
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura.

723
00:58:16,083 --> 00:58:23,589
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, in other news, there is a day one patch for the PS4 that's 300 megabytes and it's adding some interesting things.

724
00:58:25,211 --> 00:58:37,941
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to add in the remote play, which means that the titles will be displayed on the TV and you can use the Vita to connect to them.

725
00:58:38,742 --> 00:58:40,863
[SPEAKER_03]: The second screen, basically, the Vita.

726
00:58:42,024 --> 00:58:47,550
[SPEAKER_03]: You can record, take screenshots, upload different videos that you've taken.

727
00:58:49,051 --> 00:58:51,353
[SPEAKER_03]: You can watch other people play games.

728
00:58:51,394 --> 00:58:52,234
[SPEAKER_03]: You need Twitch mode.

729
00:58:53,996 --> 00:58:55,618
[SPEAKER_03]: You can play as you download.

730
00:58:55,658 --> 00:58:57,600
[SPEAKER_03]: You have multiple logins up to four people.

731
00:58:58,380 --> 00:59:01,804
[SPEAKER_03]: Voice chat, you have facial recognition and voice commands.

732
00:59:01,844 --> 00:59:02,885
[SPEAKER_03]: This is if you have the camera.

733
00:59:03,825 --> 00:59:08,087
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, background music player, online multiplayer, and the Blu-ray and DVD player.

734
00:59:08,827 --> 00:59:11,649
[SPEAKER_03]: So, they're basically going, oops, all this stuff, here you go.

735
00:59:12,889 --> 00:59:19,752
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, I see no reason to be upset about that, except that, you know, I mean, 300 meg isn't really that big.

736
00:59:20,193 --> 00:59:23,374
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just basically saying, oh, we have this functionality, now we're unlocking it.

737
00:59:23,574 --> 00:59:23,914
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

738
00:59:24,434 --> 00:59:24,835
[SPEAKER_03]: Have fun.

739
00:59:25,295 --> 00:59:25,575
[SPEAKER_03]: Party.

740
00:59:26,135 --> 00:59:26,475
[SPEAKER_03]: Literally.

741
00:59:27,436 --> 00:59:28,656
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we have party mode.

742
00:59:29,497 --> 00:59:30,997
[SPEAKER_03]: You can talk to your friends and call them assholes.

743
00:59:31,798 --> 00:59:32,138
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't.

744
00:59:32,378 --> 00:59:33,079
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching!

745
00:59:49,836 --> 00:59:52,440
[SPEAKER_08]: Who cares if I can download a title and play partway?

746
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:54,102
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't have internet, so it doesn't matter to me.

747
00:59:55,664 --> 00:59:58,307
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's the only thing that's kind of lame about that.

748
00:59:58,527 --> 01:00:04,515
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, a lot of people nowadays have internet, so they could probably download it one way or another.

749
01:00:04,856 --> 01:00:05,857
[SPEAKER_08]: As long as I think is...

750
01:00:06,798 --> 01:00:32,690
[SPEAKER_08]: as long as they support being able to download that off of a storage device or something like that so you can go to your friend's house, download it onto a USB stick and pop it into your PS4 or something like that like you can right now with the PlayStation 3 then that might not be so bad if someone doesn't actually have internet then they could just go somewhere else and get it but if it's like the Xbox 360 or something usually you can't do that, you have to burn a disc or something

751
01:00:33,050 --> 01:00:34,412
[SPEAKER_07]: There is a part of me – sorry, Jamie.

752
01:00:34,452 --> 01:00:42,880
[SPEAKER_07]: There is a part of me that wonders like, well, those poor people that are going to buy this system mostly for the Blu-ray playback are going to get screwed because they can't connect to the internet.

753
01:00:42,900 --> 01:00:43,981
[SPEAKER_07]: But then I go, well, wait a minute.

754
01:00:44,261 --> 01:00:52,288
[SPEAKER_07]: When those people just get a PlayStation 3 because they're still on the market and they're going to be cheaper, like these early adopters have got to be techie people in the first place, right?

755
01:00:53,089 --> 01:00:53,369
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

756
01:00:53,490 --> 01:00:56,072
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think this news is super bad or – it's –

757
01:00:57,474 --> 01:00:59,156
[SPEAKER_07]: It's an inconvenience.

758
01:00:59,316 --> 01:01:03,763
[SPEAKER_08]: And to be fair, at least the update's a lot smaller than the Wii U one.

759
01:01:03,783 --> 01:01:10,833
[SPEAKER_08]: 300 megs, I mean, fuck, that's half the size of the DLC for Saints Row 4, and you're getting way more replay value out of that.

760
01:01:11,846 --> 01:01:12,367
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

761
01:01:31,147 --> 01:01:32,668
[SPEAKER_06]: Jason, I'm sure they already do that.

762
01:01:32,768 --> 01:01:42,012
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, if you were to ask them those types of questions at Best Buy, like, you know, how could I switch between my Xbox and my PlayStation or whatever, I'm sure Geek Squad would be happy to come out there and hook it all up for you.

763
01:01:42,272 --> 01:01:47,294
[SPEAKER_06]: I always have to wave off that stupid $3 disc insurance thing whenever I buy a game.

764
01:01:47,395 --> 01:01:56,279
[SPEAKER_07]: Or Grandma, you know, I want to set up Netflix on the Wii for my kid and they literally don't know how to do it because, you know, I could see where there's a small market for that.

765
01:01:56,299 --> 01:01:58,039
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Ranma says they do that now.

766
01:01:58,800 --> 01:01:59,140
Yeah.

767
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:21,640
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a feeling but there's a few other things with this one thing that will not be available at launch is the suspend resume mode that's supposed to basically use the low power state and take you back into your game but they said there's more to come on that in the future there's also a PlayStation app that's going to be out on November 13th in North America and the 22nd of November in Europe

768
01:02:22,403 --> 01:02:22,703
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura

769
01:02:48,783 --> 01:03:01,805
[SPEAKER_08]: that's it I mean it's just like hey I bought this car I heard all these great things about the wheels it has oh fuck it doesn't have wheels damn no we can't have that and we will continue to not have that for the foreseeable decades

770
01:03:04,359 --> 01:03:15,588
[SPEAKER_06]: Without devolving on yet another tangent, this is one of those things that there's very much an argument to the success of Valve in the sense that they don't tout everything until it's there.

771
01:03:15,989 --> 01:03:18,070
[SPEAKER_06]: Valve has not said a word about Half-Life 3.

772
01:03:18,631 --> 01:03:20,492
[SPEAKER_06]: We know nothing of what Half-Life 3 will be.

773
01:03:21,213 --> 01:03:29,179
[SPEAKER_06]: If and when it finally gets here, there's no expectations other than it's got to be better than the second game, and there's a good chance that that's going to happen.

774
01:03:29,339 --> 01:03:30,981
[SPEAKER_07]: Is Valve a publicly traded company?

775
01:03:31,701 --> 01:03:32,061
[SPEAKER_06]: and DarkSakura.com

776
01:03:52,560 --> 01:04:15,952
[SPEAKER_06]: it's a really really tangled web because at the same time more often than not company stocks sink during news announcements or at least maybe the most popular ones like Amazon, Apple and possibly also Microsoft but that's not an uncommon trend which seems to say why do we even bother going through this media hype only to have bad news once we get to the end of it

777
01:04:18,775 --> 01:04:20,936
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, well, is that it, DarkSakura?

778
01:04:20,956 --> 01:04:21,376
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you have more?

779
01:04:21,436 --> 01:04:26,759
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I actually had more to say about the app, but I didn't get it out.

780
01:04:26,879 --> 01:04:28,059
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Tangent-y tonight.

781
01:04:28,079 --> 01:04:28,620
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I know.

782
01:04:29,380 --> 01:04:38,685
[SPEAKER_03]: The app itself, what it's supposed to do is it lets you access the PlayStation Network, your friends list, your trophies, but it also is to act as a second screen for games that support it.

783
01:04:39,285 --> 01:04:41,686
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I wanted to get that out.

784
01:04:43,044 --> 01:04:43,284
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.

785
01:04:43,324 --> 01:04:44,444
[SPEAKER_03]: For people who don't know.

786
01:04:44,664 --> 01:04:50,826
[SPEAKER_07]: I just hope the servers don't all get hammered the first day and the damn thing takes forever to download like what happened on Wii U. Are you being prophetic?

787
01:04:51,146 --> 01:04:51,986
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, just saying.

788
01:04:52,106 --> 01:04:52,406
[SPEAKER_07]: They will.

789
01:04:52,706 --> 01:04:53,246
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure they will.

790
01:04:53,266 --> 01:04:54,266
[SPEAKER_03]: You just jinxed them, Rob.

791
01:04:54,286 --> 01:04:54,607
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

792
01:04:54,947 --> 01:04:55,847
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, Rob.

793
01:04:56,307 --> 01:04:56,467
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

794
01:04:56,647 --> 01:04:59,288
[SPEAKER_07]: This is like one of the first rules of the internet.

795
01:04:59,428 --> 01:05:00,628
[SPEAKER_08]: This stuff always happens.

796
01:05:00,668 --> 01:05:01,188
[SPEAKER_08]: Here we go.

797
01:05:01,508 --> 01:05:02,228
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's how they can do this.

798
01:05:02,308 --> 01:05:02,608
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

799
01:05:03,348 --> 01:05:04,929
[SPEAKER_08]: Put up the patch now on their website.

800
01:05:04,989 --> 01:05:06,209
[SPEAKER_08]: Download it to the fucking thumb drive.

801
01:05:06,389 --> 01:05:06,629
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

802
01:05:06,649 --> 01:05:07,329
[SPEAKER_07]: Why don't they just do that?

803
01:05:07,389 --> 01:05:07,889
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

804
01:05:08,110 --> 01:05:09,970
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be a great idea, actually.

805
01:05:10,877 --> 01:05:12,977
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, we know our servers are probably going to get hammered at launch.

806
01:05:13,298 --> 01:05:15,738
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, you want to be a little bit imprimptive about it?

807
01:05:15,758 --> 01:05:16,718
[SPEAKER_07]: Put it on fucking BitTorrent.

808
01:05:16,818 --> 01:05:17,979
[SPEAKER_07]: Put a BitTorrent out there.

809
01:05:18,039 --> 01:05:20,079
[SPEAKER_07]: Then it won't even be on their servers.

810
01:05:21,779 --> 01:05:22,780
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know about that.

811
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:25,400
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'm just saying.

812
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:26,660
[SPEAKER_07]: You could.

813
01:05:29,841 --> 01:05:31,981
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a little too controversial for them.

814
01:05:32,061 --> 01:05:33,682
[SPEAKER_08]: But then hackers would tear that shit apart.

815
01:05:33,702 --> 01:05:35,242
[SPEAKER_07]: They're going to tear it apart anyway.

816
01:05:35,582 --> 01:05:36,922
[SPEAKER_07]: What are they going to do with it?

817
01:05:37,543 --> 01:05:39,183
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just going to take them five minutes longer.

818
01:05:39,980 --> 01:05:43,145
[SPEAKER_07]: Figure out that much faster how to install Linux on it, I guess.

819
01:05:43,366 --> 01:05:45,289
[SPEAKER_03]: They've already done it to the toaster, so don't get me started.

820
01:05:58,314 --> 01:06:00,716
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so a little bit more about the PlayStation 4.

821
01:06:01,456 --> 01:06:06,659
[SPEAKER_08]: There were some details coming out about the digital games and some of the benefits you get with PlayStation Plus.

822
01:06:06,699 --> 01:06:12,443
[SPEAKER_08]: For example, digital games, you can actually share your account with two consoles.

823
01:06:12,743 --> 01:06:17,466
[SPEAKER_08]: So you have one console that you deem your primary console that kind of operates the way I see it.

824
01:06:17,486 --> 01:06:18,526
[SPEAKER_08]: It's similar to like...

825
01:06:19,867 --> 01:06:21,308
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

826
01:06:42,145 --> 01:06:45,748
[SPEAKER_08]: You can also use two systems concurrently.

827
01:06:46,208 --> 01:06:51,292
[SPEAKER_08]: So the system activated is your primary PS4 and one other system that you're logged into.

828
01:06:52,313 --> 01:07:08,305
[SPEAKER_08]: So that, to me, sounds like if I get Grand Theft Auto V for the PlayStation 4 or something like that, or whatever, and I have the digital download for, like... I download it to my system, and then I...

829
01:07:09,266 --> 01:07:09,806
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

830
01:07:28,258 --> 01:07:34,262
[SPEAKER_06]: If everybody's in the same household, you can have those guest accounts, which are the same gamertag with the 1, 2, 3 appended to it.

831
01:07:34,602 --> 01:07:38,065
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's what you're thinking of, but certainly not across two consoles in different locations.

832
01:07:38,185 --> 01:07:49,612
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it sounds like... Well, I mean, it sounds similar to what... I think, didn't you guys have to do something like that with Mass Effect or something, where you'd play on one console and log in with the other person's thing?

833
01:07:49,712 --> 01:07:50,673
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

834
01:07:50,973 --> 01:07:53,394
[SPEAKER_08]: They've kind of done this right now, I want to say, with...

835
01:07:55,538 --> 01:07:56,058
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

836
01:08:22,686 --> 01:08:26,728
[SPEAKER_08]: So, they started limiting that down to, I think now it's down to two.

837
01:08:27,468 --> 01:08:28,688
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that's what they have here.

838
01:08:28,888 --> 01:08:32,110
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you could exploit that, but I don't think it's meant for that.

839
01:08:32,130 --> 01:08:35,151
[SPEAKER_08]: It's more of like, you know, I'm going to my friend's house or something.

840
01:08:35,171 --> 01:08:40,153
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's more like you are going to go to your friends and play one game, but your little brother is still at home playing your PlayStation 4.

841
01:08:40,793 --> 01:08:42,994
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, it's more like that kind of situation, right?

842
01:08:43,214 --> 01:08:43,734
[SPEAKER_08]: I think so.

843
01:08:44,174 --> 01:08:45,595
[SPEAKER_07]: Two is pretty reasonable.

844
01:08:46,055 --> 01:08:47,535
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I think that's how it's supposed to be.

845
01:08:48,956 --> 01:08:49,636
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, here we go.

846
01:08:49,696 --> 01:08:51,697
[SPEAKER_08]: It says, let's see.

847
01:08:53,756 --> 01:08:54,998
[SPEAKER_08]: That graphic is clear as mud.

848
01:09:11,064 --> 01:09:13,465
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that is... I don't understand what the fuck they're talking about.

849
01:09:14,425 --> 01:09:16,425
[SPEAKER_08]: A system that is activated as a primary.

850
01:09:17,825 --> 01:09:19,066
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you had it right.

851
01:09:19,246 --> 01:09:19,826
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't get it.

852
01:09:20,066 --> 01:09:21,646
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's... Yeah, I think I had it right.

853
01:09:22,106 --> 01:09:22,686
[SPEAKER_06]: You had it right.

854
01:09:22,846 --> 01:09:27,987
[SPEAKER_06]: You can... You, with your account, with your PlayStation Network account, can download things to the console.

855
01:09:28,368 --> 01:09:32,108
[SPEAKER_06]: As soon as it's on the console, anybody else can take advantage of that locally.

856
01:09:32,588 --> 01:09:34,969
[SPEAKER_06]: Nobody else can start a download using your account.

857
01:09:35,989 --> 01:09:38,130
[SPEAKER_06]: It's pretty expected.

858
01:09:38,751 --> 01:09:48,236
[SPEAKER_08]: Some other random details that were released, I guess, that the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One both support up to eight people in party chat.

859
01:09:48,356 --> 01:09:49,157
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, here's my question.

860
01:09:49,197 --> 01:09:51,938
[SPEAKER_08]: How many does the Xbox 360 support now in party chat?

861
01:09:51,958 --> 01:09:53,879
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I think it's quite a few people.

862
01:09:54,160 --> 01:09:54,620
[SPEAKER_06]: I think eight.

863
01:09:54,980 --> 01:09:55,440
[SPEAKER_06]: You think six?

864
01:09:55,460 --> 01:09:56,321
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought it was only six.

865
01:09:56,761 --> 01:10:00,883
[SPEAKER_06]: I seem to remember it's a full game limited to four plus just two more.

866
01:10:01,744 --> 01:10:02,184
[SPEAKER_06]: Could be wrong.

867
01:10:02,284 --> 01:10:03,785
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been forever since I've used that.

868
01:10:05,200 --> 01:10:32,383
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know because I know I've had a lot of people in party chat before but I don't remember I haven't really counted there's no it worked so it'd be interesting hopefully it's the same or more you know yeah and he said party voice chat will support eight players like on PlayStation 4 like from support.xbox.com a party can contain up to eight people once the maximum attendance is reached someone must leave the party before another person can join

869
01:10:33,991 --> 01:10:36,453
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the GTFO our party right now.

870
01:10:36,513 --> 01:10:37,714
[SPEAKER_03]: We want someone cool.

871
01:10:39,256 --> 01:10:39,816
[SPEAKER_07]: Get out.

872
01:10:40,497 --> 01:10:41,778
[SPEAKER_08]: We have no cake for you.

873
01:10:42,339 --> 01:10:50,906
[SPEAKER_07]: I was gonna say, like, eight seems right because, like, isn't, like, a Forza Horizon match, like, eight people and, like, a lot of Xbox Live stuff is, like, eight people, I think.

874
01:10:51,127 --> 01:10:51,667
[SPEAKER_07]: So, anyway.

875
01:10:52,068 --> 01:10:52,388
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

876
01:10:53,949 --> 01:10:54,290
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.

877
01:10:55,663 --> 01:10:57,744
[SPEAKER_07]: Bravely Default for the Sequel Bravely Default for the Sequel

878
01:11:18,818 --> 01:11:24,362
[SPEAKER_07]: Bravely Second will have time-stopping antics, which were in the original game.

879
01:11:24,922 --> 01:11:28,505
[SPEAKER_07]: But it relies on what's called SP, special power.

880
01:11:29,405 --> 01:11:31,507
[SPEAKER_07]: Once you use this power, your SP decreases.

881
01:11:31,927 --> 01:11:36,731
[SPEAKER_07]: You can gain SP when you put your 3DS in sleep mode, but it's a little bit slow.

882
01:11:36,771 --> 01:11:38,352
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like regening mana in EverQuest.

883
01:11:38,392 --> 01:11:39,272
[SPEAKER_07]: It's very, very slow.

884
01:11:39,773 --> 01:11:42,755
[SPEAKER_07]: One SP point is added for every eight hours of idle time.

885
01:11:43,535 --> 01:11:44,136
[SPEAKER_07]: But guess what?

886
01:11:44,176 --> 01:11:44,936
[SPEAKER_07]: If you don't want to wait...

887
01:11:45,817 --> 01:11:50,041
[SPEAKER_07]: You can buy potions on the 3DS eShop that refill your SP.

888
01:11:50,742 --> 01:11:53,605
[SPEAKER_07]: I've seen that model before on a Facebook game.

889
01:11:56,207 --> 01:11:56,527
[SPEAKER_06]: Yuck.

890
01:11:56,808 --> 01:12:00,631
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we keep telling Nintendo they need to learn the internet, so where better to turn to?

891
01:12:00,651 --> 01:12:02,193
[SPEAKER_07]: This is not the place to do it.

892
01:12:02,273 --> 01:12:04,415
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think this is actually a Nintendo game, however.

893
01:12:05,256 --> 01:12:05,336
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

894
01:12:06,863 --> 01:12:07,403
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't know.

895
01:12:07,844 --> 01:12:12,926
[SPEAKER_07]: Producer Tomoya Asano assures fans that this will be a good thing.

896
01:12:13,186 --> 01:12:13,547
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course.

897
01:12:13,927 --> 01:12:18,589
[SPEAKER_07]: Quote, Bravely Second isn't a demerit, but a system that gives players an advantage.

898
01:12:19,009 --> 01:12:20,970
[SPEAKER_07]: It's convenient and it's very powerful.

899
01:12:21,291 --> 01:12:24,332
[SPEAKER_07]: So in other words, it's for people that want to cheat, I guess is what I'm reading in that.

900
01:12:24,452 --> 01:12:27,574
[SPEAKER_07]: And so if you want to like, you can buy cheats, essentially.

901
01:12:27,874 --> 01:12:30,275
[SPEAKER_07]: This game is out in Japan in December.

902
01:12:31,516 --> 01:12:33,437
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if it's coming out here.

903
01:12:33,957 --> 01:12:35,178
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't heard anything about it.

904
01:12:38,328 --> 01:12:39,128
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm trying to see.

905
01:12:39,729 --> 01:12:42,810
[SPEAKER_06]: Bravely Default Western release includes updated for the sequel.

906
01:12:42,890 --> 01:12:44,911
[SPEAKER_07]: We had the first one.

907
01:12:46,271 --> 01:12:52,113
[SPEAKER_08]: So, Bravely Default, I'm switching my internal clock to make it look like it's a day later.

908
01:12:52,213 --> 01:12:53,834
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, look, there's all my energy back.

909
01:12:53,874 --> 01:12:57,575
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I wonder if people would be able to time travel and trick the thing that way.

910
01:12:57,875 --> 01:13:00,657
[SPEAKER_06]: Another article on the site says that it's going to be out in North America in 2014.

911
01:13:00,697 --> 01:13:00,997
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, thank you.

912
01:13:04,853 --> 01:13:06,393
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't play the first one, I gotta be honest.

913
01:13:06,413 --> 01:13:08,934
[SPEAKER_07]: But I did hear about it, and some people seem to enjoy it.

914
01:13:11,775 --> 01:13:21,298
[SPEAKER_07]: I really hope that this is something that truly, not just because the dude says it is, truly has no impact on the game if I were to not use it.

915
01:13:21,398 --> 01:13:27,399
[SPEAKER_07]: In other words, I could still beat the game start to finish without too much hassle, without even touching this stuff.

916
01:13:27,419 --> 01:13:28,400
[SPEAKER_07]: Because that would just be shitty.

917
01:13:30,080 --> 01:13:31,482
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't really have another word for it.

918
01:13:31,602 --> 01:13:33,405
[SPEAKER_06]: One point for every eight hours, though.

919
01:13:33,505 --> 01:13:38,232
[SPEAKER_06]: On any scale of any RPG I've ever played, that's ludicrously small.

920
01:13:38,933 --> 01:13:42,077
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's assume something's 15 points.

921
01:13:42,117 --> 01:13:44,661
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what, four days of idle before you recharge that?

922
01:13:45,883 --> 01:13:46,464
[SPEAKER_03]: It's ridiculous.

923
01:13:46,949 --> 01:13:50,771
[SPEAKER_07]: Shane's telling me we haven't had the first one, but I'm looking at it right here on Amazon for sale.

924
01:13:50,811 --> 01:13:51,591
[SPEAKER_07]: Or is this an import?

925
01:13:52,571 --> 01:13:53,632
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just Japanese.

926
01:13:54,232 --> 01:13:54,892
[SPEAKER_07]: I got fooled.

927
01:13:55,192 --> 01:13:55,953
[SPEAKER_03]: It has a really pretty art.

928
01:13:57,433 --> 01:13:58,774
[SPEAKER_06]: So you know somebody that imported it?

929
01:13:59,074 --> 01:13:59,674
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess so.

930
01:14:01,235 --> 01:14:06,497
[SPEAKER_06]: As if there's not plenty of people around this table that's ever done something like that for a game before.

931
01:14:07,658 --> 01:14:10,619
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, let's move on before we get to release dates, DarkSakura.

932
01:14:11,908 --> 01:14:18,532
[SPEAKER_03]: We have, remember last week we talked about, was it last week I think, that Nintendo wasn't going to be making Wii for Japan anymore?

933
01:14:19,732 --> 01:14:23,554
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Wii, not the Wii U. Well, it's already been confirmed as well for Europe.

934
01:14:25,015 --> 01:14:35,300
[SPEAKER_03]: They are going to be producing no more for the European markets, and Nintendo of the UK said that the consumers who don't own a Wii can still buy a Wii Mini instead.

935
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:56,970
[SPEAKER_03]: that's the lower price point that has a bunch of the stuff missing it's all using DLC sorry it's only disc based games and no deals no download titles and no backwards compatibility but no word for the US yet there was a second body type for the Wii

936
01:14:57,697 --> 01:14:59,158
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if the Mini ever did.

937
01:14:59,178 --> 01:14:59,458
[SPEAKER_08]: Canada.

938
01:14:59,478 --> 01:15:01,520
[SPEAKER_08]: Canada got the red one, of course.

939
01:15:01,540 --> 01:15:02,580
[SPEAKER_08]: But I don't think it ever came out in the U.S.,

940
01:15:27,637 --> 01:15:28,879
[SPEAKER_06]: I missed all of this news.

941
01:15:29,460 --> 01:15:30,421
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just crap.

942
01:15:30,461 --> 01:15:34,547
[SPEAKER_08]: Seriously, if you're gonna save money on a Wii, buy a used Wii.

943
01:15:35,548 --> 01:15:39,394
[SPEAKER_08]: Why bother wasting money on a brand new piece of shit that doesn't do anything?

944
01:15:41,495 --> 01:15:46,941
[SPEAKER_07]: The Wii does have a huge game library though for people that might want to get one for a younger person.

945
01:15:48,203 --> 01:15:49,604
[SPEAKER_07]: Entry level gaming console or whatever.

946
01:15:50,305 --> 01:15:58,515
[SPEAKER_08]: And really the Wii was only good for me for one thing and that was weather and Wii News and I can't do that anymore because the news channel doesn't work.

947
01:16:00,497 --> 01:16:05,621
[SPEAKER_06]: I checked that every... It's funny that you mentioned that because I kind of liked those channels for a very long time.

948
01:16:05,981 --> 01:16:10,485
[SPEAKER_06]: There's always something wrong with the news channel and yeah, I don't know.

949
01:16:10,625 --> 01:16:13,727
[SPEAKER_06]: I found easier... Oh, no, I know what happened.

950
01:16:13,887 --> 01:16:20,592
[SPEAKER_06]: I found an iPhone and then having to go back to a console on my TV was not exactly as important or convenient anymore.

951
01:16:20,833 --> 01:16:26,657
[SPEAKER_03]: I just can't believe that I waited in line for that except that I hung out with Kristen the whole time and it was pretty fun and we got donuts.

952
01:16:27,085 --> 01:16:29,649
[SPEAKER_08]: It was alright in the beginning.

953
01:16:29,990 --> 01:16:31,692
[SPEAKER_08]: Excite Truck was awesome.

954
01:16:32,333 --> 01:16:33,595
[SPEAKER_08]: You're still mad about Excitebots.

955
01:16:33,615 --> 01:16:36,840
[SPEAKER_08]: I am still fucking... I am furious about Excitebots.

956
01:16:37,942 --> 01:16:38,323
[SPEAKER_08]: Seriously.

957
01:16:39,249 --> 01:16:45,770
[SPEAKER_08]: Who on the face of the earth thought, hey, let's put a minigame in the middle of a fucking race, and that's a great idea?

958
01:16:46,170 --> 01:16:46,551
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

959
01:16:46,571 --> 01:16:48,191
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to punch them in the goddamn face.

960
01:16:48,291 --> 01:16:53,972
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, for some reason, it's become like a trend on Twitter lately to really hate on the Twilight Princess as part of the Zelda series.

961
01:16:54,032 --> 01:16:58,953
[SPEAKER_07]: But, I mean, that game was like the shit when it first came out on the Nintendo Wii.

962
01:16:59,013 --> 01:17:00,673
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, just kind of what it did.

963
01:17:00,753 --> 01:17:02,534
[SPEAKER_03]: And I named my cat after her.

964
01:17:04,054 --> 01:17:06,856
[SPEAKER_07]: and kind of like, you know, what that brought to the table for gaming in general.

965
01:17:08,136 --> 01:17:12,819
[SPEAKER_07]: So I guess, you know, now if you go back and play it now, it's a little bit like, oh, this is very linear.

966
01:17:13,159 --> 01:17:15,540
[SPEAKER_07]: But I mean, it was great at the time.

967
01:17:16,641 --> 01:17:18,462
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, the Wii brought a lot of great games.

968
01:17:18,542 --> 01:17:18,802
[SPEAKER_07]: Come on.

969
01:17:19,582 --> 01:17:20,342
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, let's move on.

970
01:17:20,402 --> 01:17:26,144
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got to travel around the world and check out some release dates and what's coming out near you soon.

971
01:17:26,584 --> 01:17:26,804
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

972
01:17:27,444 --> 01:17:31,646
[SPEAKER_08]: So this week, actually a lot of games, but no particular order here.

973
01:17:31,726 --> 01:17:38,047
[SPEAKER_08]: Monster High 13 Wishes for Girls on the Wii and Wii U, 3DS and DS.

974

975
01:17:47,750 --> 01:18:05,777
[SPEAKER_08]: Sonic Lost World on 3DS and Wii U, Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures, the game that sort of resembles some of the 3D Sonic games and based on some new animated TV series, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii and Wii U and 3DS I believe.

976
01:18:07,217 --> 01:18:08,798
[SPEAKER_08]: The Game Stick is finally coming out.

977
01:18:10,771 --> 01:18:11,272

980
01:18:19,880 --> 01:18:24,284
[SPEAKER_08]: The Darkness Mafia 2 and Bioshock.

981
01:18:25,565 --> 01:18:26,466
[SPEAKER_08]: I have to make sure here.

982
01:18:26,486 --> 01:18:27,687
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't read this.

983
01:18:28,568 --> 01:18:30,309
[SPEAKER_08]: Bioshock 2, Darkness 2 and Mafia 2.

01:18:54,577 --> 01:19:01,143
[SPEAKER_08]: Assassin's Creed 4 Black Flag on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii U, and no PC.

987
01:19:01,623 --> 01:19:07,529
[SPEAKER_08]: That's coming out later because we can't get their release dates coordinated for the PC versions.

988
01:19:09,150 --> 01:19:12,553
[SPEAKER_08]: WWE 2K14 on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

989
01:19:12,613 --> 01:19:12,934
[SPEAKER_08]: What else here?

990
01:19:19,656 --> 01:19:22,098
[SPEAKER_08]: Transformers Ultimate Battle Edition re-released there.

991
01:19:22,218 --> 01:19:24,220
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, Ultimate Autobots Edition.

01:19:25,321 --> 01:19:28,064
[SPEAKER_08]: And... There's one last one here.

993
01:19:30,025 --> 01:19:31,827

[SPEAKER_08]: Doodle Jump.

998
01:19:41,295 --> 01:19:42,056
[SPEAKER_08]: And then...

999
01:19:45,651 --> 01:19:54,015
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, I think on Friday, I think that's the first, they're going to have a Wii Remote Plus for Luigi and Mario.

1000
01:19:55,355 --> 01:19:57,596
[SPEAKER_08]: Alrighty, because that's cool and all.

1001
01:19:58,656 --> 01:20:11,542
[SPEAKER_08]: I wanted to add, this is kind of funny, because I don't know if they even talked next-gen release dates yet, but Call of Duty Ghosts on all formats will be coming out on the 5th.

1002
01:20:11,842 --> 01:20:12,382
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right.

1003
01:20:12,862 --> 01:20:14,323
[SPEAKER_08]: You can get Call of Duty Ghosts

1004
01:20:15,283 --> 01:20:19,307
[SPEAKER_08]: 2 weeks before the system that comes out to play it on the Xbox One.

1005
01:20:39,847 --> 01:20:42,448
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, let's take a look at Japan and what's coming out in Japan.

1006
01:20:42,488 --> 01:20:45,049
[SPEAKER_07]: They're getting their releases on Halloween the 31st.

1007
01:20:45,789 --> 01:20:48,110
[SPEAKER_07]: The FPS Pad 3 Strike Gear.

1008
01:20:48,130 --> 01:20:49,410
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's actually an accessory.

1009
01:20:49,450 --> 01:20:50,131
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, that's not a game.

1010
01:20:51,051 --> 01:20:54,192
[SPEAKER_07]: But you can get a Mahjong game called Dankyu Battle 3.

1011
01:20:54,232 --> 01:20:56,013
[SPEAKER_07]: It comes out this week on the PlayStation 3.

1012
01:20:56,673 --> 01:21:03,258
[SPEAKER_07]: Tears to Tiara 2, How No Matsue comes out in a first print limited edition, if you're so inclined.

1013
01:21:03,598 --> 01:21:07,902
[SPEAKER_07]: And then Vampire Resurrection, just in time for Halloween, gets a price reduction.

1014
01:21:08,402 --> 01:21:09,803
[SPEAKER_07]: So there you go on the PlayStation 3.

1015
01:21:10,063 --> 01:21:13,005
[SPEAKER_07]: On the Xbox 360, there is really nothing this week.

1016
01:21:13,045 --> 01:21:17,369
[SPEAKER_07]: You can get that same little FPS pad thing I talked about before.

1017
01:21:17,689 --> 01:21:18,289
[SPEAKER_07]: That's really it.

1018
01:21:19,650 --> 01:21:43,909
[SPEAKER_07]: on the PlayStation Vita this week Gundam Breaker and there is also a new slim model because I believe those Vita slims those just came out in Japan like last couple weeks ago or one of them right there's a Gundam Breaker Vita pack if you're so inclined so that's out also Chu Jijijen Gemu Neptune Rebirth 1 in regular and limited edition is out on the Vita as well

1019
01:21:44,969 --> 01:21:46,430
[SPEAKER_07]: on the Wii U this week.

1020
01:21:46,530 --> 01:21:49,071
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, there is some Wii U stuff in Japan this week.

1021
01:21:49,491 --> 01:21:52,493
[SPEAKER_07]: Wii Party U is one of the big games coming out.

1022
01:21:52,873 --> 01:22:01,977
[SPEAKER_07]: And then there's some stuff that's centered around, it looks like Wii Fit U, but is that available for download on the 31st?

1023
01:22:02,137 --> 01:22:03,778
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't remember how that whole thing was going down.

1024
01:22:03,798 --> 01:22:05,619
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember you could download it a month early or something?

1025
01:22:05,699 --> 01:22:12,222
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, you're supposed to be able to download it a month early, and I know that next, not next week, but the week after next, those stupid Wii Fit

1026
01:22:12,802 --> 01:22:14,884
[SPEAKER_08]: and DarkSakura.com.

1027
01:22:34,338 --> 01:22:39,786
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, looks like there's a new bundle in Japan that's 32 gigs, Black Wii U, with Mario Bros.

1028
01:22:39,967 --> 01:22:46,035
[SPEAKER_07]: U, Wii Party U, Wii Fit U, a Wiimote, and the whole little sensor bar thing.

1029
01:22:46,055 --> 01:22:49,701
[SPEAKER_07]: And it comes with one of the little portable walk...

1030
01:22:50,201 --> 01:22:51,522
[SPEAKER_07]: What are those called?

1031
01:22:52,382 --> 01:22:54,323
[SPEAKER_07]: They look like Tamagotchis, for God's sake.

1032
01:22:54,343 --> 01:22:55,844
[SPEAKER_07]: They're little Wii U Tamagotchis.

1033
01:22:56,984 --> 01:22:57,605
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's you.

1034
01:22:57,725 --> 01:22:59,746
[SPEAKER_07]: That's straight up the pocket station right there.

1035
01:23:00,066 --> 01:23:00,346
[SPEAKER_07]: Right?

1036
01:23:01,506 --> 01:23:03,967
[SPEAKER_07]: They've got a hefty little bundle there in Japan out this week.

1037
01:23:06,108 --> 01:23:06,388
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1038
01:23:07,489 --> 01:23:07,969
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.

1039
01:23:08,369 --> 01:23:15,190
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, moving on to the Nintendo 3DS, Danball Senki Wars is out this week.

1040
01:23:16,091 --> 01:23:22,372
[SPEAKER_07]: And Chara Petsukute Sodatete, character Shogaku, comes out this week.

1041
01:23:22,912 --> 01:23:28,774
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's just cute little animals, including a pink panda who has hearts for ears.

1042
01:23:29,614 --> 01:23:30,354
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that's adorable.

1043
01:23:31,034 --> 01:23:32,195
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it for Japanese releases.

1044
01:23:32,215 --> 01:23:33,295
[SPEAKER_07]: How about the UK, DarkSakura?

1045
01:23:33,863 --> 01:23:44,206
[SPEAKER_03]: In the UK, we have on the 29th of October, WWE K-14, on the 31st, Football Manager 2014 for PC and Mac, and Toki Tori.

1046
01:23:46,306 --> 01:23:46,806
[SPEAKER_03]: Excuse me.

1047
01:23:47,446 --> 01:23:53,028
[SPEAKER_03]: On November 1st, there's Angry Birds Star Wars for damn near everything, and Angry Birds Star Wars 2 for damn near every console.

1048
01:23:53,788 --> 01:24:02,370
[SPEAKER_03]: Assassin's Creed 4, Black Flag, Battlefield 4, Blur Overdrive for iPad and iPhone, and Wii Fit U.

1049
01:24:03,905 --> 01:24:07,267
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1050
01:24:24,558 --> 01:24:29,704
[SPEAKER_08]: Instead of Nintendo Land being in there, they're kind of updating the whole SKU with now new Super Mario Bros.

1051
01:24:29,904 --> 01:24:40,797
[SPEAKER_08]: U and the DLC new Super Luigi U. So you'll be able to get that for $2.99 this holiday starting, I believe, the end of next week.

1052
01:24:43,560 --> 01:24:44,240
[SPEAKER_08]: Be pretty fast.

1053
01:24:44,320 --> 01:24:55,170
[SPEAKER_08]: And then also, even though it is leaving shelves in a couple other regions, the Wii will still be around in the US.

1054
01:24:55,650 --> 01:25:03,036
[SPEAKER_08]: And basically the announcement of the Wii console being discontinued is specific to Japan, well now Europe.

1055
01:25:03,196 --> 01:25:08,421
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no change of status in the Wii in the United States and is available for purchase this holiday season.

1056
01:25:11,294 --> 01:25:13,255
[SPEAKER_08]: Metal Gear Rising will be getting a PlayStation 3 special edition.

1057
01:25:29,543 --> 01:25:58,719
[SPEAKER_07]: it's a DLC bundled PlayStation 3 re-release that's going to come out later this year for Metal Gear Rising and it's the Revengeance Special Edition it will have Blade Wolf and Jetstream DLC packs 30 VR missions 5 alternate costumes and a custom PlayStation 3 theme you can check all that out on December 5th and it's also going to be available as a download on PlayStation Network as most of the game releases are don't know yet if this is coming out stateside

1058
01:25:59,199 --> 01:26:01,260
[SPEAKER_07]: This is only confirmed for Japan as of right now.

1059
01:26:02,241 --> 01:26:04,142
[SPEAKER_07]: Speaking of PlayStation, I have another quick story.

1060
01:26:04,202 --> 01:26:08,023
[SPEAKER_07]: This is about a whole little PlayStation bundle.

1061
01:26:09,384 --> 01:26:10,305
[SPEAKER_07]: This is interesting.

1062
01:26:10,525 --> 01:26:14,807
[SPEAKER_07]: A Gran Turismo 6 bundle that's going to come out in Brazil.

1063
01:26:15,827 --> 01:26:22,371
[SPEAKER_07]: It's an... I'm going to mispronounce this name, and I apologize because he passed away in 1994, but he was a very famous racer.

1064
01:26:22,951 --> 01:26:24,632
[SPEAKER_07]: Ayrton Senna.

1065
01:26:25,152 --> 01:26:26,233
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope I didn't mispronounce that.

1066
01:26:26,273 --> 01:26:26,973
[SPEAKER_07]: I apologize if I did.

1067
01:26:27,713 --> 01:26:32,734
[SPEAKER_07]: But he's going to be featured as part of this Gran Turismo 6 bundle that's coming out.

1068
01:26:33,114 --> 01:26:36,835
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's supposed to actually kind of like help charity, which is pretty cool.

1069
01:26:36,995 --> 01:26:44,557
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm assuming that part of the proceeds of the bundle actually go to the institute set up in this guy's name that helps to educate.

1070
01:26:44,577 --> 01:26:45,157
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's pretty cool.

1071
01:26:45,918 --> 01:26:48,338
[SPEAKER_07]: This is on December 6th that this is coming out in Brazil.

1072
01:26:48,358 --> 01:26:51,099
[SPEAKER_07]: It comes out with Gran Turismo 6, a 250 gigabyte PlayStation 3, and one controller.

1073
01:26:51,119 --> 01:26:51,199
[SPEAKER_07]: So...

1074
01:26:56,281 --> 01:26:57,424
[SPEAKER_07]: That's very cool.

1075
01:26:58,326 --> 01:27:04,399
[SPEAKER_07]: One other reason I bring this up is that I don't know if you guys saw, but apparently the PlayStation 4 is going to cost oodles and oodles of money in Brazil.

1076
01:27:05,196 --> 01:27:05,857
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you hear about that?

1077
01:27:06,017 --> 01:27:08,159
[SPEAKER_03]: It kind of doesn't surprise me, though.

1078
01:27:08,219 --> 01:27:09,680
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, everything costs more over there.

1079
01:27:09,800 --> 01:27:13,323
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I know, but it's like on the scale of $1,500 or something.

1080
01:27:13,483 --> 01:27:18,508
[SPEAKER_07]: When you convert the money, it's a really high price.

1081
01:27:19,729 --> 01:27:23,072
[SPEAKER_07]: I bet there will be people that just somehow get one from the U.S.

1082
01:27:23,152 --> 01:27:25,514
[SPEAKER_07]: or another place and import them for way less.

1083
01:27:25,734 --> 01:27:26,595
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's taxes.

1084
01:27:26,795 --> 01:27:29,778
[SPEAKER_08]: The thing is, taxes really affect the price.

1085
01:27:29,798 --> 01:27:31,239
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not that they're marking it up.

1086
01:27:31,319 --> 01:27:32,380
[SPEAKER_07]: People get them illegally.

1087
01:27:34,136 --> 01:27:34,416
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1088
01:27:35,277 --> 01:27:39,920
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's travel back to a time when Gran Turismo 5 wasn't even out.

1089
01:27:40,020 --> 01:27:42,341
[SPEAKER_07]: Heck, I don't even think the original Gran Turismo was out.

1090
01:27:42,842 --> 01:27:46,464
[SPEAKER_08]: In fact, some people would still agree that Gran Turismo 5 is not out yet.

1091
01:27:46,624 --> 01:27:48,585
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the joke I was trying to make unsuccessfully.

1092
01:27:49,566 --> 01:27:57,131
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's time for DarkSakura to step into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, hey, you should, like, play this now and stuff.

1093
01:27:57,211 --> 01:27:58,231
[SPEAKER_07]: You're going to roll your eyes.

1094
01:27:58,512 --> 01:28:01,053
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm totally going to roll my eyes at this week's...

1095
01:28:04,025 --> 01:28:05,246
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't do anything for Shane.

1096
01:28:05,266 --> 01:28:06,026
[SPEAKER_07]: That was the first mistake.

1097
01:28:06,046 --> 01:28:08,387
[SPEAKER_03]: I am doing something for Shane so that he will help me level.

1098
01:28:08,627 --> 01:28:09,928
[SPEAKER_07]: You're only making him stronger.

1099
01:28:09,948 --> 01:28:10,368
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

1100
01:28:10,388 --> 01:28:13,170
[SPEAKER_07]: You're only making his horrible powers stronger.

1101
01:28:13,710 --> 01:28:14,751
[SPEAKER_03]: Shane, don't listen to them.

1102
01:28:14,931 --> 01:28:16,051
[SPEAKER_03]: You have good taste in music.

1103
01:28:16,632 --> 01:28:20,314
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week?

1104
01:28:20,614 --> 01:28:21,694
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Pokemon Red and Blue.

1105
01:28:23,495 --> 01:28:24,336
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't laugh.

1106
01:28:24,376 --> 01:28:25,156
[SPEAKER_03]: These aren't classics.

1107
01:28:25,176 --> 01:28:25,957
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't judge me.

1108
01:28:26,837 --> 01:28:28,018
[SPEAKER_03]: You're totally judging me right now.

1109
01:28:29,338 --> 01:28:30,059
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe a little bit.

1110
01:28:31,980 --> 01:28:32,320
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

1111
01:28:34,588 --> 01:28:40,891
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyway, this was developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo for the Game Boy.

1112
01:28:41,291 --> 01:28:43,332
[SPEAKER_03]: And this came out in 1996.

1113
01:28:44,773 --> 01:28:47,074
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, in Japan, they came out as Red and Green.

1114
01:28:47,714 --> 01:28:50,075
[SPEAKER_03]: And Blue was released as a special edition.

1115
01:28:50,575 --> 01:28:55,077
[SPEAKER_03]: Then they were released as Red and Blue in North America, Europe, and Australia over the next three years.

1116
01:28:55,177 --> 01:29:00,620
[SPEAKER_03]: Pokemon Yellow is a special version that was basically like, hi, here's Pikachu.

1117
01:29:01,340 --> 01:29:07,302
[SPEAKER_03]: Both have been remade, by the way, as Pokemon FireRed and LeafGreen that came out in 2004.

1118
01:29:08,022 --> 01:29:17,004
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically, overhead perspective, you go through the fictional area of Kanto, and you basically abuse your poor little animals and make Peeta cry.

1119
01:29:17,024 --> 01:29:19,725
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm kidding, because that was a fake.

1120
01:29:20,225 --> 01:29:26,006
[SPEAKER_03]: But you basically pit your animals against each other and see who is the greatest.

1121
01:29:26,727 --> 01:29:27,547
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, you know...

1122
01:29:29,028 --> 01:29:33,793
[SPEAKER_03]: I love how in Japan the game was more marketed as with the adventure and everything.

1123
01:29:33,853 --> 01:29:37,717
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, the collection thing was a part of it, but it's like blatant commercialism out here.

1124
01:29:38,057 --> 01:29:39,018
[SPEAKER_03]: Gotta catch them all!

1125
01:29:39,498 --> 01:29:40,980
[SPEAKER_03]: Like rabies or something, I don't know.

1126
01:29:41,901 --> 01:29:47,847
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyway, you have to fight the different gym leaders and you collect badges and you beat the game like that.

1127
01:29:48,868 --> 01:29:49,208
[SPEAKER_03]: So, uh...

1128
01:29:51,370 --> 01:29:55,853
[SPEAKER_03]: Other things about this game is that you have a little thing in there called the Pokédex.

1129
01:29:56,514 --> 01:30:07,181
[SPEAKER_03]: And basically for the first game you had 150 available Pokémon and you could keep track of all of them that you catch in your Pokédex and you still had to deal with Team Rocket.

1130
01:30:07,981 --> 01:30:15,726
[SPEAKER_03]: You could also use your GameLink cable to connect your games together and let you trade and battle between games, which my husband and I did quite a bit.

1131
01:30:16,927 --> 01:30:19,128
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe Dan played Red and I played Blue.

1132
01:30:19,729 --> 01:30:28,935
[SPEAKER_03]: Then there was the 151st Pokemon Mew that you could only get through official distribution by Nintendo.

1133
01:30:29,555 --> 01:30:34,378
[SPEAKER_03]: or buy a glitch and I won't say anything about getting it that way because I got it.

1134
01:30:36,140 --> 01:30:38,341
[SPEAKER_08]: Honestly though I used... The Nintendo police are coming to your house right now.

1135
01:30:39,382 --> 01:30:42,184
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever, they're a little late.

1136
01:30:42,444 --> 01:30:53,931
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, I mean basically IGN ranked it as one of the top 100 games of all time and in 2009 it was in the Guinness Book of World Records as best-selling RPG on Game Boy and best-selling RPG on time.

1137
01:30:55,553 --> 01:31:07,107
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically you have the third person overhead view but when you're in your battles it switches to a behind the back of your whatever Pokemon that you're playing and you can change them out.

1138
01:31:07,127 --> 01:31:07,988
[SPEAKER_03]: You have up to six.

1139
01:31:08,609 --> 01:31:09,470
[SPEAKER_03]: You cannot teach...

1140
01:31:11,232 --> 01:31:14,933
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, Pokemon who have wings, you have to teach them how to fly.

1141
01:31:15,253 --> 01:31:16,594
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, really, what's up with that?

1142
01:31:17,394 --> 01:31:19,434
[SPEAKER_03]: You get experience, you level them up.

1143
01:31:20,555 --> 01:31:27,177
[SPEAKER_03]: You also can get some of the most useless piece of crap Pokemon ever, like Magikarp.

1144
01:31:27,677 --> 01:31:35,139
[SPEAKER_03]: But, Magikarp turns into Gyarados, and I have gone through the entire game with Gyarados, and I haven't even anything else.

1145
01:31:35,399 --> 01:31:41,991
[SPEAKER_07]: The first time I did that whole wonder trade on Pokemon X and Y, somebody sent me a fucking Magikarp.

1146
01:31:42,552 --> 01:31:45,016
[SPEAKER_07]: But of course it was Japanese Magikarps, that made it a little cooler.

1147
01:31:47,120 --> 01:31:47,520
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Rob.

1148
01:31:48,664 --> 01:32:05,178
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, as far as other elements in the game, you do also have the capturing aspect where you can find Pokemon in the wild and you can put them into a life of eternal servitude living in little balls for the rest of their existence.

1149
01:32:05,959 --> 01:32:10,624
[SPEAKER_08]: Like little animal genies that come out and do cage fighting for you.

1150
01:32:11,184 --> 01:32:12,866
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1151
01:32:14,247 --> 01:32:20,753
[SPEAKER_03]: And to also say something about something that was mentioned in the last game, Pikachu is the breed, not its name.

1152
01:32:20,813 --> 01:32:22,495
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like calling your dog, Dog.

1153
01:32:23,095 --> 01:32:24,997
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like calling your cat, Cat.

1154
01:32:25,558 --> 01:32:26,919
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a cat named Mr. Cat.

1155
01:32:27,239 --> 01:32:28,340
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a little bit more respectful.

1156
01:32:28,681 --> 01:32:29,822
[SPEAKER_03]: It'd be like saying Pikachu-san.

1157
01:32:30,802 --> 01:32:33,864
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyway, there have been other versions, of course.

1158
01:32:34,524 --> 01:32:36,966
[SPEAKER_03]: There were gold, silver, and crystal.

1159
01:32:37,006 --> 01:32:38,366
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a second generation.

1160
01:32:39,387 --> 01:32:46,591
[SPEAKER_03]: And using the transfer pack on Nintendo 64, you could actually use items from your red and blue in Pokemon Stadium and Pokemon Stadium 2.

1161
01:32:48,052 --> 01:32:50,673
[SPEAKER_03]: However, they were not compatible with the advanced generation.

1162
01:32:51,773 --> 01:32:55,716
[SPEAKER_03]: Which, I actually had Pokemon Stadium, but I kind of didn't play it much.

1163
01:32:56,756 --> 01:33:02,459
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, really the best part about Pokemon Stadium was like, just watching your Pokemon come out and do their little poses and then it got boring.

1164
01:33:03,479 --> 01:33:05,660
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I love seeing Shrew.

1165
01:33:06,441 --> 01:33:08,822
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, I'm looking over the shoulder.

1166
01:33:09,272 --> 01:33:11,373
[SPEAKER_03]: So the setting of the game takes place in Kanto.

1167
01:33:13,173 --> 01:33:21,336
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's got different habitats for the different Pokemon, different towns and cities, and routes that connect them all to each other.

1168
01:33:22,096 --> 01:33:26,458
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can get some of them only by fishing.

1169
01:33:26,518 --> 01:33:29,019
[SPEAKER_03]: You can get stuff like a Zubat only in the cave.

1170
01:33:29,699 --> 01:33:32,240
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're sent out by Professor Oak.

1171
01:33:33,500 --> 01:33:39,443
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, who, uh, lets you pick one, and then, um, you are in a rivalry with Oak's grandson.

1172
01:33:40,504 --> 01:33:43,465
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, who, what was his name, Gary?

1173
01:33:44,866 --> 01:33:49,928
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, cause I remember, cause the character in Japan was actually named after Miyamoto, his name was Shigeru.

1174
01:33:51,089 --> 01:33:51,689
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um...

1175
01:33:53,896 --> 01:34:02,940
[SPEAKER_03]: There's also a rumor that we were supposed to get a version of, that there had been an intention to do a version of Green that had a female trainer.

1176
01:34:03,721 --> 01:34:06,722
[SPEAKER_03]: But that, you know, that's still on the rumor mill.

1177
01:34:07,162 --> 01:34:10,363
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, you can start off with Bulbasaur, Squirtle, or Charmander.

1178
01:34:10,884 --> 01:34:13,425
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, my first game playthrough is Bulbasaur.

1179
01:34:13,565 --> 01:34:17,987
[SPEAKER_03]: Every other time I've ever, you know, I switched to Red and was like Charmander all the way because I didn't care.

1180
01:34:18,847 --> 01:34:21,008
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but uh, my first playthrough was with Bulbasaur.

1181
01:34:22,028 --> 01:34:31,372
[SPEAKER_03]: And uh, basically you uh, eventually have to fight the Elite Four, and the new champion who is, boom, your rival, so you have to kick their ass.

1182
01:34:32,032 --> 01:34:43,077
[SPEAKER_03]: So the whole concept of Pokemon started, and I don't know how many people um, know about this, that um, the designer Satoshi Tajiri was an insect collector.

1183
01:34:44,117 --> 01:35:00,729
[SPEAKER_03]: and uh so basically he wanted to give that same feeling of discovery of capture of you know collection like that of live specimens into a game that wouldn't people could play anytime you wouldn't necessarily have to live out in the country for it

1184
01:35:01,589 --> 01:35:14,513
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, he was noticing that kids played more in their homes instead of outside, so he wanted to sort of give people the feeling of being able to grow up in the outside environment, and like I said, that sense of discovery.

1185
01:35:15,614 --> 01:35:22,976
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, he also did not want to make games that had more, as he said, pointless violence, even though he's having animals fight each other.

1186
01:35:22,996 --> 01:35:23,276
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1187
01:35:23,946 --> 01:35:32,929
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, I mean, basically, uh, that was the other one I was trying to remember, is that the character that you play as is named Satoshi, after, you know, himself.

1188
01:35:33,289 --> 01:35:35,490
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course his rival is Shikaru, after Miyamoto.

1189
01:35:36,450 --> 01:35:49,314
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, it's really, you know, there's so much more about this, you know, a lot of history that went into the, um, production of the game, like, um,

1190
01:35:52,424 --> 01:36:05,912
[SPEAKER_03]: They even made some different audio advancements by using different sounds in the processor to create a snare sound using basically a white noise filter in the Game Boy.

1191
01:36:07,073 --> 01:36:14,878
[SPEAKER_03]: Creating the animal sounds by using the Pokemon sounds by basically making it a very short chiptune.

1192
01:36:16,259 --> 01:36:22,223
[SPEAKER_03]: It was supposed to be originally called Capsule Monster, but there was a trademark issue.

1193
01:36:22,283 --> 01:36:26,305
[SPEAKER_03]: They were going to call it Capomon, and basically they went to Pocket Monster, so it's Pokemon.

1194
01:36:27,266 --> 01:36:35,892
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was basically rejected over and over by Nintendo until Miyamoto came out with the golden way of making it work.

1195
01:36:36,372 --> 01:36:37,973
[SPEAKER_03]: So, that's why we have it.

1196
01:36:38,994 --> 01:36:39,074
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

1197
01:36:41,596 --> 01:36:48,153
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's... I'm not going to go into a lot more of the detail because really there is a whole hell of a lot about this game.

1198
01:36:48,513 --> 01:36:49,055
[SPEAKER_03]: But, um...

1199
01:36:51,596 --> 01:36:54,417
[SPEAKER_03]: If you haven't played the original, I think you're kind of missing out.

1200
01:36:54,517 --> 01:37:05,079
[SPEAKER_03]: Even if you're not a big fan of Pokemon at all today, if you don't care about the new ones, I think that if anyone wants a good, rounded-off, classic gaming background, Pokemon should be in it.

1201
01:37:05,499 --> 01:37:06,920
[SPEAKER_03]: So, that's my final word.

1202
01:37:07,540 --> 01:37:11,981
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, there it is, your Classic Game of the Week, or Games of the Week, Pokemon Red and Pokemon Blue.

1203
01:37:12,441 --> 01:37:14,162
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can add yellow into it because it was the same gen.

1204
01:37:14,182 --> 01:37:16,003
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to say, my first Pokemon game was yellow.

1205
01:37:16,324 --> 01:37:17,985
[SPEAKER_07]: So it was the same gen.

1206
01:37:18,545 --> 01:37:24,489
[SPEAKER_06]: I got the see-through, off-purple Game Boy Color and Pokemon Yellow.

1207
01:37:24,589 --> 01:37:28,812
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it was because of the damn anime that I loved Pokemon.

1208
01:37:28,832 --> 01:37:31,814
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I had the Japanese theme song memorized for years.

1209
01:37:31,854 --> 01:37:36,977
[SPEAKER_03]: And I actually have... You know how you used to buy singles in those square cases with the little tiny disc inside?

1210
01:37:37,378 --> 01:37:39,719
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually have the Niasu Sings.

1211
01:37:40,079 --> 01:37:40,360
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

1212
01:37:40,720 --> 01:37:41,440
[SPEAKER_03]: Niasu is Meowth.

1213
01:37:42,721 --> 01:37:45,323
[SPEAKER_03]: So it also has the full Team Rocket song on it.

1214
01:37:46,083 --> 01:37:51,686
[SPEAKER_07]: I squeed in the new Pokemon X and Y when wild Pikachus were showing up in the second zone you're in.

1215
01:37:51,726 --> 01:37:53,727
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, yes, that's the Pokemon I want to capture.

1216
01:37:54,087 --> 01:37:55,248
[SPEAKER_07]: The right call.

1217
01:37:55,508 --> 01:37:58,690
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, just to say, one of Shermie's nicknames was Caterpie.

1218
01:38:00,050 --> 01:38:00,531
[SPEAKER_03]: Just saying.

1219
01:38:00,731 --> 01:38:01,211
[SPEAKER_07]: Just saying.

1220
01:38:01,351 --> 01:38:04,032
[SPEAKER_06]: It is pretty crazy to think that the games Red and Blue predated the anime.

1221
01:38:05,072 --> 01:38:07,233
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I know, right?

1222
01:38:07,653 --> 01:38:12,695
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that the games, I think that it was more of a simultaneous thing over here.

1223
01:38:12,715 --> 01:38:14,696
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the anime had already been out forever.

1224
01:38:15,116 --> 01:38:18,597
[SPEAKER_03]: And for the record, the Porygon episode totally did not make me have a seizure.

1225
01:38:20,558 --> 01:38:20,838
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1226
01:38:21,298 --> 01:38:22,839
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to take a quick break, guys.

1227
01:38:22,859 --> 01:38:26,920
[SPEAKER_07]: When we come back, there's plenty more OLR to come, including rapid-fire news, more emails.

1228
01:38:26,980 --> 01:38:28,321
[SPEAKER_07]: I know we already had one at the top of the show.

1229
01:38:28,341 --> 01:38:28,981
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got more to come.

1230
01:38:29,381 --> 01:38:31,102
[SPEAKER_07]: Fugle Question of the Week and plenty, plenty more.

1231
01:38:31,162 --> 01:38:33,342
[SPEAKER_07]: Your calls as well, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1232
01:38:33,643 --> 01:38:36,804
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll be back, though, after a quick break with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1233
01:38:37,064 --> 01:38:37,624
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't go anywhere.

1234
01:38:43,638 --> 01:38:50,965
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio, live on this Sunday night with episode number 525 of our show.

1235
01:38:51,265 --> 01:38:55,990
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a palindrome, and it's a multiple of 25, so therefore it's an event episode tonight.

1236
01:38:58,072 --> 01:39:08,782
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it's always an event when the awesome Jason is here with us, as he can't join us all the time, but once in a while he's in San Francisco for work and drives up the road to come say hi.

1237
01:39:09,102 --> 01:39:11,904
[SPEAKER_06]: Because 22 hours to San Francisco in the first place wasn't enough.

1238
01:39:12,265 --> 01:39:14,186
[SPEAKER_06]: Had to do the extra two hours up to Sacramento.

1239
01:39:14,226 --> 01:39:15,648
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you wave the first time through?

1240
01:39:17,209 --> 01:39:29,339
[SPEAKER_06]: I was thinking of making a surprise stop in here because I was... I don't remember if I was in Sacramento city limits or at least around the downtown area when the show started or if it was just after.

1241
01:39:29,860 --> 01:39:34,043
[SPEAKER_06]: And I probably should have considering that I proceeded to take about four hours because of the traffic.

1242
01:39:35,084 --> 01:39:39,867
[SPEAKER_06]: in just South Sacramento, plus the traffic in Berkeley, plus the traffic in downtown.

1243
01:39:39,927 --> 01:39:41,408
[SPEAKER_07]: You drove in during the BART strike.

1244
01:39:44,530 --> 01:39:45,210
[SPEAKER_06]: Congrats.

1245
01:39:45,230 --> 01:39:47,611
[SPEAKER_07]: That was not a very nice end to two days worth of driving.

1246
01:39:47,751 --> 01:39:48,112
[SPEAKER_07]: I bet.

1247
01:39:48,232 --> 01:39:48,712
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my gosh.

1248
01:39:49,032 --> 01:39:51,433
[SPEAKER_07]: So you drove here all the way from Colorado where you live.

1249
01:39:51,854 --> 01:39:54,875
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you drive nonstop and pull over and sleep?

1250
01:39:54,895 --> 01:39:55,736
[SPEAKER_06]: Where do you stop?

1251
01:39:56,116 --> 01:39:59,139
[SPEAKER_06]: I could do it because it's about 20-21 hours.

1252
01:39:59,579 --> 01:40:03,343
[SPEAKER_06]: In this case, I left just before noon on Saturday.

1253
01:40:04,364 --> 01:40:06,045
[SPEAKER_06]: Drove out to Nevada.

1254
01:40:06,205 --> 01:40:07,246
[SPEAKER_06]: Stayed in Elko, Nevada.

1255
01:40:08,047 --> 01:40:09,268
[SPEAKER_06]: Very small town.

1256
01:40:09,749 --> 01:40:10,910
[SPEAKER_06]: About central Nevada.

1257
01:40:11,871 --> 01:40:13,492
[SPEAKER_06]: And then continued the rest of the way.

1258
01:40:13,532 --> 01:40:15,394
[SPEAKER_06]: The next day, I pulled into the parking lot.

1259
01:40:17,242 --> 01:40:18,202
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1260
01:40:38,451 --> 01:40:57,486
[SPEAKER_07]: and you guys can share your opinions as well you can either do that live with us tonight live.vognetwork.com if you're listening to us on this Sunday night or of course if you're listening to us on the podcast you can always tweet at us at OLR or you can email us mailbag at orangelaunceradio.com let's check out some rapid fire news and quickly talk about a few things here Loki

1261
01:40:58,566 --> 01:41:16,255
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, so since there really hasn't been too much going on with Minecraft on the Xbox 360 as far as updates go, they have been putting out some skin packs to re-skin the whole look of Minecraft and sometimes include free levels and stuff.

1262
01:41:16,635 --> 01:41:19,057
[SPEAKER_08]: They have another one coming out though for Halloween.

1263
01:41:19,137 --> 01:41:25,220
[SPEAKER_08]: It kind of re-skins everything, makes another nice and green and everything very Halloween-y.

1264
01:41:26,080 --> 01:41:27,181
[SPEAKER_08]: And the price of that...

1265
01:41:27,981 --> 01:41:28,301
[SPEAKER_08]: Free!

1266
01:41:28,962 --> 01:41:30,543
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I think you can afford that.

1267
01:41:31,303 --> 01:41:32,664
[SPEAKER_08]: So go check it out if you haven't yet.

1268
01:41:33,104 --> 01:41:37,667
[SPEAKER_08]: And also, creepers are nice and ghostly white now.

1269
01:41:37,927 --> 01:41:38,587
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's kind of fun.

1270
01:41:39,628 --> 01:41:41,709
[SPEAKER_06]: And the Slenderman's about.

1271
01:41:42,850 --> 01:41:47,552
[SPEAKER_08]: Ah, yes, I'm assuming that they've redone the Enderman then to make him look like a Slenderman.

1272
01:41:48,593 --> 01:41:50,054
[SPEAKER_08]: Very clever, I guess.

1273
01:41:50,794 --> 01:41:57,018
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, and then on top of that, Grand Theft Auto, since I love talking about Grand Theft Auto,

1274
01:41:58,527 --> 01:41:59,028
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1275
01:42:17,549 --> 01:42:20,470
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to be next week, I think, or maybe even beyond that.

1276
01:42:21,530 --> 01:42:23,710
[SPEAKER_08]: The Beach Bum Pack is something that they're going to put out.

1277
01:42:23,730 --> 01:42:26,151
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the first piece of DLC that's going to be free.

1278
01:42:26,791 --> 01:42:30,792
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's going to add some weapons and vehicles to the game, as well as clothing items.

1279
01:42:30,932 --> 01:42:33,552
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's both online and single player.

1280
01:42:34,533 --> 01:42:42,334
[SPEAKER_08]: And then also, of course, the content creator for Deathmatch and Races is going to be available as well in November.

1281
01:42:42,774 --> 01:42:46,455
[SPEAKER_08]: And so you'll be able to create your own Deathmatches and Deathmatch arenas.

1282
01:42:47,095 --> 01:43:10,475
[SPEAKER_08]: and races in the game which I think is going to be pretty awesome when we get to do that and last but not least it's been leaked out that there is a new kind of zombie mode in the game of Call of Duty Ghosts except now instead of zombies it's extinction and extinction has to do with aliens so you're fighting off aliens instead of zombies and

1283
01:43:11,035 --> 01:43:14,897
[SPEAKER_08]: and they're going to have the different type of stuff to go along with that as well.

1284
01:43:15,477 --> 01:43:18,199
[SPEAKER_08]: So, interesting.

1285
01:43:19,099 --> 01:43:22,661
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess we'll learn more about that pretty soon since the game comes out in two weeks.

1286
01:43:26,062 --> 01:43:32,408
[SPEAKER_07]: or you can always get your PlayStation 4 one early and just look at the box and think about that alien mode, right?

1287
01:43:32,488 --> 01:43:33,609
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, or the Xbox One.

1288
01:43:33,949 --> 01:43:36,231
[SPEAKER_08]: You have extra time to contemplate the alien mode.

1289
01:43:36,271 --> 01:43:36,871
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

1290
01:43:36,992 --> 01:43:39,314
[SPEAKER_07]: Just sit there and think about it.

1291
01:43:39,694 --> 01:43:42,496
[SPEAKER_07]: Killer Instinct, some more news coming out about that.

1292
01:43:42,556 --> 01:43:46,620
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, I've seen some footage coming out of those Xbox One preview events of Killer Instinct.

1293
01:43:46,960 --> 01:43:48,841
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1294
01:44:15,487 --> 01:44:37,856
[SPEAKER_07]: apparently the highest difficulty level in the game when you're in training mode you can do very easy of course and hard and so forth but the most difficult level is something called Kyle it's apparently named on one of the development team's AI designers who is insanely good at the game so you can fight Kyle who I guess works there and is really really good at I hate you Kyle I hate you Kyle

1295
01:44:40,349 --> 01:44:41,690
[SPEAKER_07]: SuperCastlevania4

1296
01:45:06,144 --> 01:45:10,707
[SPEAKER_07]: is the Wii U release on Virtual Console this week on Halloween.

1297
01:45:11,608 --> 01:45:13,810
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, I already had that when it was on the Wii.

1298
01:45:13,830 --> 01:45:15,511
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of games, I have in the box.

1299
01:45:15,571 --> 01:45:16,031
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

1300
01:45:16,292 --> 01:45:20,094
[SPEAKER_07]: So I can get this for a dollar if I want to get the Wii U Virtual Console version, which I probably will.

1301
01:45:20,235 --> 01:45:21,295
[SPEAKER_03]: You can come to my house and play it.

1302
01:45:21,636 --> 01:45:23,477
[SPEAKER_03]: I can, but... Dude, that would be awesome.

1303
01:45:23,657 --> 01:45:24,958
[SPEAKER_03]: Castlevania Fest on Halloween.

1304
01:45:25,238 --> 01:45:31,423
[SPEAKER_07]: But I can't... See, what I can do in my house that I can't do at your house is play Castlevania 4 on the toilet.

1305
01:45:31,923 --> 01:45:32,824
[SPEAKER_07]: I almost said in the toilet.

1306
01:45:33,704 --> 01:45:34,285
[SPEAKER_07]: On the toilet.

1307
01:45:34,696 --> 01:45:36,467
[SPEAKER_03]: technically, I have a way to do this

1308
01:45:38,430 --> 01:45:40,331
[SPEAKER_03]: I have extension cords and very small TVs.

1309
01:45:40,551 --> 01:45:42,392
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess I really shouldn't challenge you, should I?

1310
01:45:43,273 --> 01:45:43,673
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1311
01:45:44,193 --> 01:45:45,034
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll think of a way.

1312
01:45:46,174 --> 01:45:49,256
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember, 90% of what I have done, motivated by spite.

1313
01:45:49,456 --> 01:45:50,156
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, and porn.

1314
01:45:53,818 --> 01:45:58,561
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow, that was one of, obviously, the best Super Nintendo games and best games in the Castlevania series.

1315
01:45:59,341 --> 01:46:02,663
[SPEAKER_07]: Not my absolute favorite in the Castlevania series, but for some people it is their favorite.

1316
01:46:03,164 --> 01:46:04,624
[SPEAKER_07]: And I will say this, killer soundtrack.

1317
01:46:05,165 --> 01:46:05,665
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of the best.

1318
01:46:06,025 --> 01:46:06,425
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.

1319
01:46:06,605 --> 01:46:10,807
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, in my esteem, nothing beats Dracula X. Symphony of the Night.

1320
01:46:11,227 --> 01:46:12,708
[SPEAKER_07]: I know it's cliche, but damn it.

1321
01:46:13,388 --> 01:46:14,208
[SPEAKER_07]: So freaking good.

1322
01:46:14,749 --> 01:46:23,152
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say of the traditional Castlevania games, Dracula X. Dracula X is more like a bridge between those styles.

1323
01:46:23,252 --> 01:46:29,275
[SPEAKER_07]: I still have a soft spot for Simon's Quest, which I think is the earliest kind of Metroidvania style game.

1324
01:46:29,295 --> 01:46:30,635
[SPEAKER_03]: What a terrible night for a curse.

1325
01:46:30,695 --> 01:46:30,996
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway.

1326
01:46:32,396 --> 01:46:33,698
[SPEAKER_07]: But we're digressing again.

1327
01:46:34,378 --> 01:46:44,628
[SPEAKER_07]: How about some rumors about other Mario Universe characters that could possibly be playable in Super Mario 3D World?

1328
01:46:44,989 --> 01:46:50,414
[SPEAKER_07]: There's some speculation out there because of stamp collecting that occurs in Super Mario 3D World.

1329
01:46:50,754 --> 01:46:56,060
[SPEAKER_07]: There's some icons that have been spotted where, hmm, this kind of looks like Rosalina.

1330
01:46:56,420 --> 01:46:57,060
[SPEAKER_07]: Super Mario 3D World

1331
01:47:20,674 --> 01:47:31,182
[SPEAKER_07]: is going to already have Luigi, Mario, Princess, and Toad in the style of their appearance in Super Mario 2, where Princess floats, Luigi does flappy legs, and all that stuff.

1332
01:47:31,242 --> 01:47:32,843
[SPEAKER_03]: You mean Doki Doki Panic, the ROM hack?

1333
01:47:32,923 --> 01:47:33,944
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, same thing.

1334
01:47:34,764 --> 01:47:36,406
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a little more than a ROM hack, though.

1335
01:47:36,546 --> 01:47:40,649
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, I stole that from Game Sack, but it was probably the best name for it I've ever heard.

1336
01:47:41,823 --> 01:47:42,644
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, what do you have for us?

1337
01:47:42,664 --> 01:47:44,326
[SPEAKER_07]: I have stuff I have a site that won't load so I'm skipping it

1338
01:48:00,340 --> 01:48:04,682
[SPEAKER_03]: and this is the very important news that everyone's been waiting for.

1339
01:48:05,102 --> 01:48:08,604
[SPEAKER_03]: How to avoid Pokemon X and Y's game breaking bug.

1340
01:48:09,744 --> 01:48:12,225
[SPEAKER_03]: First of all, you can download the patch, which is out.

1341
01:48:13,646 --> 01:48:20,549
[SPEAKER_03]: The patch is out there on the 3DS eShop and you just go there, update, blah, blah, blah, you're done.

1342
01:48:20,669 --> 01:48:24,211
[SPEAKER_03]: However, other ways around...

1343
01:48:24,691 --> 01:48:25,552
[SPEAKER_03]: Did we finally breed?

1344
01:48:25,652 --> 01:48:27,674
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm literally opening up the eShop right now.

1345
01:48:27,694 --> 01:48:28,695
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, oh shit, she's got a point.

1346
01:48:28,715 --> 01:48:34,059
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought you were checking to see if our machines... No, our DSs do not want to mate today for some reason.

1347
01:48:34,279 --> 01:48:35,721
[SPEAKER_03]: Here, I'll move you over there.

1348
01:48:36,321 --> 01:48:36,902
[SPEAKER_07]: Very rude.

1349
01:48:37,222 --> 01:48:38,723
[SPEAKER_03]: I even had mine hump yours, okay?

1350
01:48:39,364 --> 01:48:39,484
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1351
01:48:40,925 --> 01:48:41,566
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my!

1352
01:48:43,328 --> 01:48:43,748
[SPEAKER_03]: Scandal.

1353
01:48:43,988 --> 01:48:58,224
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, so the other way that you could do that is that, like I said, Nintendo had put out a map that showed where the bug could occur, and so it gave you areas that you could save your game in and avoid the bug.

1354
01:48:58,724 --> 01:49:05,932
[SPEAKER_03]: But now with the fix that's come out, it also should correct any broken game saves.

1355
01:49:06,453 --> 01:49:15,522
[SPEAKER_03]: So wherever you saved, if you happen to have experienced this bug, if you haven't deleted your save file, then you should be fine.

1356
01:49:15,563 --> 01:49:16,283
[SPEAKER_03]: It will be restored.

1357
01:49:16,303 --> 01:49:18,025
[SPEAKER_03]: Just go to your eShop and download it.

1358
01:49:19,286 --> 01:49:46,769
[SPEAKER_03]: in other news oh god I was just talking about Rival Schools a moment ago too there is some talk from Hideaki Itsuno who wants to create a Rival Schools 3 and Rival Schools is probably like my all time favorite number one fighting game series ever in the world universe I love it I mean I even like it better than all the Tekkens combined and I really like me some Tekken

1359
01:49:47,609 --> 01:49:52,954
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, he was the past director of the Rival School series, and he did, um, recently did Dragon's Dogma.

1360
01:49:53,715 --> 01:50:02,183
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, he basically, you know, what was, uh, said about it is that it was, it captured authentic fighting.

1361
01:50:02,963 --> 01:50:07,968
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, as you say, basically, uh, Street Fighter II was his, um, inspiration.

1362
01:50:08,468 --> 01:50:12,472
[SPEAKER_03]: So during an interview, he said, and this is with the Anime News Network, um...

1363
01:50:13,553 --> 01:50:17,975
[SPEAKER_03]: He said that he would really like to make a new Rival Schools title.

1364
01:50:18,375 --> 01:50:19,735
[SPEAKER_03]: Which, honestly, do it.

1365
01:50:21,456 --> 01:50:22,396
[SPEAKER_03]: No hesitation, do it.

1366
01:50:22,536 --> 01:50:24,237
[SPEAKER_03]: Bring back all the characters, put in some more.

1367
01:50:25,697 --> 01:50:28,358
[SPEAKER_03]: We haven't had all the sports done.

1368
01:50:28,398 --> 01:50:30,679
[SPEAKER_03]: We could have more hooligans.

1369
01:50:30,759 --> 01:50:31,339
[SPEAKER_03]: We could have more.

1370
01:50:31,900 --> 01:50:36,021
[SPEAKER_06]: I was talking about this before the show with Rob, and I was saying that I really, really miss Rival Schools Disc 2.

1371
01:50:36,861 --> 01:50:38,762
[SPEAKER_06]: All of those minigames were incredibly fun.

1372
01:50:39,554 --> 01:50:43,436
[SPEAKER_03]: Or, you know, you've had Sakura in the game now for two versions of it.

1373
01:50:43,516 --> 01:50:45,116
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, she's a hidden character in the first one.

1374
01:50:45,656 --> 01:50:49,278
[SPEAKER_03]: And officially in... Well, you know, I have the Evolution disc.

1375
01:50:50,358 --> 01:50:53,059
[SPEAKER_03]: That had, like, the dancing game and the dating sim and all that in it.

1376
01:50:53,820 --> 01:50:56,000
[SPEAKER_03]: I paid a hundred bucks for that sucker when I had money.

1377
01:50:56,881 --> 01:50:58,361
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's freaking awesome.

1378
01:50:58,461 --> 01:51:00,522
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll have to show you some stuff on it.

1379
01:51:00,562 --> 01:51:03,323
[SPEAKER_03]: But, like, I got, like, Batsu asked my character out.

1380
01:51:03,383 --> 01:51:04,524
[SPEAKER_03]: It was all cool and cute.

1381
01:51:05,724 --> 01:51:07,105
[SPEAKER_03]: But there were...

1382
01:51:09,736 --> 01:51:18,359
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the game that introduced the Taicho, the class president, and the photographer, and dude who swims.

1383
01:51:19,419 --> 01:51:20,359
[SPEAKER_03]: Why can't I remember his name?

1384
01:51:20,979 --> 01:51:26,701
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's the game that introduced a lot of those characters that were in Rival Schools 2, and then Rival Schools 2 brought out my favorite of all time, Zaki.

1385
01:51:28,522 --> 01:51:29,342
[SPEAKER_03]: But I mean, just think about it.

1386
01:51:29,542 --> 01:51:30,162
[SPEAKER_03]: It's about time.

1387
01:51:32,043 --> 01:51:32,363
[SPEAKER_07]: Why not?

1388
01:51:32,643 --> 01:51:32,843
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1389
01:51:33,163 --> 01:51:35,824
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm actually, now I'm done filling time for the story that wouldn't load.

1390
01:51:38,537 --> 01:51:50,303
[SPEAKER_06]: I can finish one off on that note my conventional popular still going fighting games I love but either Rival Schools or Bloody Roar are probably my two favorites from that era

1391
01:51:51,158 --> 01:51:52,919
[SPEAKER_06]: Bloody Roar was an interesting game.

1392
01:51:53,800 --> 01:51:57,041
[SPEAKER_06]: Didn't they actually remake that in like the last couple years?

1393
01:51:57,201 --> 01:51:57,662
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

1394
01:51:57,682 --> 01:51:58,782
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't recall.

1395
01:51:59,063 --> 01:51:59,643
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just crazy.

1396
01:51:59,863 --> 01:52:02,104
[SPEAKER_08]: You may be thinking of Beast Riser.

1397
01:52:02,184 --> 01:52:04,786
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know why they call it Beast Riser.

1398
01:52:04,826 --> 01:52:07,107
[SPEAKER_08]: That's just such a dumb name for it.

1399
01:52:08,848 --> 01:52:10,229
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that was the Japanese name for it.

1400
01:52:10,509 --> 01:52:12,490
[SPEAKER_08]: Because it had an arcade version of it.

1401
01:52:12,510 --> 01:52:14,551
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a rip off of Bloody Roar.

1402
01:52:15,812 --> 01:52:18,113
[SPEAKER_03]: At least it wasn't Brutal Paws of Fury.

1403
01:52:19,974 --> 01:52:20,855
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that was kind of crap.

1404
01:52:21,937 --> 01:52:27,283
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, before we get to the Fugo question of the week We skipped a story Yeah, I was like, did you need me to do that?

1405
01:52:27,303 --> 01:52:28,565
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it wouldn't load on her iPad, right?

1406
01:52:28,725 --> 01:52:38,936
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it wouldn't load at all Which, basically anything that I ever get from that site won't load Tsk, tsk, well, here we go This is important because it was in the intro, so we have to cover it

1407
01:52:40,578 --> 01:52:41,538
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, sorry.

1408
01:52:41,718 --> 01:52:42,178
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's fine.

1409
01:52:42,238 --> 01:52:42,959
[SPEAKER_07]: It has been found.

1410
01:52:43,039 --> 01:52:45,819
[SPEAKER_07]: The ToeJam & Earl 3, Mission to Earth.

1411
01:52:46,340 --> 01:52:46,900
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

1412
01:52:47,540 --> 01:52:55,902
[SPEAKER_07]: Sega apparently made that for the Xbox, of course, but did you know that there was another ToeJam & Earl 3 at one point that was being made for the Dreamcast?

1413
01:52:56,642 --> 01:53:03,124
[SPEAKER_07]: Some footage is now online, and apparently the owner of the disc wants to have a fundraiser to get the code online.

1414
01:53:03,844 --> 01:53:05,485
[SPEAKER_07]: ToeJam & Earl 3 Back from the Dead ToeJam & Earl 3

1415
01:53:33,407 --> 01:53:34,268
[SPEAKER_03]: Star Gladiator was awesome.

1416
01:54:01,730 --> 01:54:03,673
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, now we can do the Fugle Question of the Week, yes?

1417
01:54:04,093 --> 01:54:04,714
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess.

1418
01:54:05,075 --> 01:54:05,635
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess.

1419
01:54:05,776 --> 01:54:08,780
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, DarkSakura is going to permiss it at some point here.

1420
01:54:08,800 --> 01:54:09,220
[SPEAKER_07]: So here we go.

1421
01:54:09,260 --> 01:54:13,446
[SPEAKER_07]: You take Facebook, you take Google+, slam those words to give permission.

1422
01:54:13,687 --> 01:54:14,027
[SPEAKER_03]: Permit.

1423
01:54:14,568 --> 01:54:14,868
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever.

1424
01:54:23,707 --> 01:54:27,530
[SPEAKER_07]: Facebook and Google Plus slam them together and you get Fugle Plus.

1425
01:54:27,950 --> 01:54:28,810
[SPEAKER_07]: Or we just call it Fugle.

1426
01:54:29,411 --> 01:54:31,312
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's read some of the answers here.

1427
01:54:31,432 --> 01:54:34,534
[SPEAKER_07]: And we had a lot of answers, you guys, over on Facebook and Google Plus.

1428
01:54:34,754 --> 01:54:35,535
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't read them all.

1429
01:54:35,575 --> 01:54:36,455
[SPEAKER_07]: There is not enough time.

1430
01:54:36,876 --> 01:54:38,056
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to read some of these, though.

1431
01:54:38,497 --> 01:54:44,981
[SPEAKER_07]: And the question we asked this week, what is the scariest moment you've ever experienced in a video game?

1432
01:54:45,041 --> 01:54:46,362
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, Halloween's next week, right?

1433
01:54:46,402 --> 01:54:48,183
[SPEAKER_07]: So why not ask a question about scary games?

1434
01:54:49,044 --> 01:54:49,424
[SPEAKER_07]: In spirit.

1435
01:54:49,944 --> 01:54:51,985
[SPEAKER_03]: How about when I thought Aerith was going to come back to life?

1436
01:54:52,886 --> 01:54:53,827
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a good answer.

1437
01:54:53,867 --> 01:54:54,227
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

1438
01:54:54,247 --> 01:54:55,528
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1439
01:54:55,988 --> 01:55:06,475
[SPEAKER_07]: Or mine would be probably when I was playing Silent Hill 4 The Room and I literally screamed out loud and one of those baby face monsters came running at me and Loki was like, what the hell are you doing?

1440
01:55:06,555 --> 01:55:09,397
[SPEAKER_03]: You know the only thing that creeped me out in that game was the giant head.

1441
01:55:09,877 --> 01:55:10,738
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah.

1442
01:55:10,758 --> 01:55:11,719
[SPEAKER_03]: Just watch you.

1443
01:55:11,739 --> 01:55:11,819
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

1444
01:55:12,219 --> 01:55:13,740
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1445
01:55:42,138 --> 01:55:43,559
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see, going to some other answers.

1446
01:55:43,940 --> 01:55:51,165
[SPEAKER_07]: Dead Rising says, after gathering like 30,000 PP and then trying to run to a save point while killing zombies on my last health bar.

1447
01:55:51,265 --> 01:55:51,746
[SPEAKER_07]: Scary.

1448
01:55:52,366 --> 01:55:58,851
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that was Mike saying the game Dead Rising because the 30,000 percentage points.

1449
01:55:58,911 --> 01:56:04,835
[SPEAKER_07]: See, when somebody writes their name like that, I'm like, is that what you want us to call you?

1450
01:56:05,195 --> 01:56:07,637
[SPEAKER_06]: He's definitely talking about Dead Rising the game.

1451
01:56:07,697 --> 01:56:09,459
[SPEAKER_06]: I can say that with 100% certainty.

1452
01:56:09,479 --> 01:56:09,919
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

1453
01:56:09,939 --> 01:56:10,780
[SPEAKER_07]: It does involve zombies.

1454
01:56:12,340 --> 01:56:13,680
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see, some more answers here.

1455
01:56:13,740 --> 01:56:18,041
[SPEAKER_07]: Scott W. says, it always comes back to the dog crashing through the window in Resident Evil.

1456
01:56:18,061 --> 01:56:19,042
[SPEAKER_07]: Shit gets me every time.

1457
01:56:19,362 --> 01:56:20,302
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my god, I remember that.

1458
01:56:20,822 --> 01:56:21,622
[SPEAKER_07]: It was so scary.

1459
01:56:22,122 --> 01:56:25,363
[SPEAKER_07]: Strudels89 says, playing The Last of Us in the Dark with my husband.

1460
01:56:25,663 --> 01:56:30,664
[SPEAKER_07]: Walking around a corner thinking we're safe, then having two clickers jump out and rip Joel's throat out.

1461
01:56:31,024 --> 01:56:33,085
[SPEAKER_07]: I screamed so loud and threw my controller on the bed.

1462
01:56:34,305 --> 01:56:37,987
[SPEAKER_07]: CatFury05 says the first time I saw Pyramid Head in Silent Hill 2.

1463
01:56:38,648 --> 01:56:40,009
[SPEAKER_07]: Still scares me to this day.

1464
01:56:40,549 --> 01:56:41,370
[SPEAKER_07]: That was pretty creepy.

1465
01:56:43,291 --> 01:56:45,072
[SPEAKER_07]: Mary B says Fatal Frame.

1466
01:56:45,512 --> 01:56:48,554
[SPEAKER_07]: We were in our apartment in the dark having played for a couple hours.

1467
01:56:48,934 --> 01:56:51,436
[SPEAKER_07]: As Pat said, they never attack on the stairs.

1468
01:56:51,516 --> 01:56:56,419
[SPEAKER_07]: He was promptly attacked from above by one of those ghastly creatures and I let out a blood-curdling scream.

1469
01:56:56,799 --> 01:57:00,301
[SPEAKER_07]: Game controller was thrown, lights turned on, and we were done for the night.

1470
01:57:00,821 --> 01:57:03,003
[SPEAKER_07]: That and all of Fatal Frame's freaking

1471
01:57:03,783 --> 01:57:05,885
[SPEAKER_07]: Celerity Ghosts Is that Mary Moo?

1472
01:57:06,286 --> 01:57:26,726
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes it is That is your friend Mary Let's see, Curdy K responds and says, still being a kid and playing Friday the 13th on the NES That game was so bad That game was underrated It was good It was good for what it was There were better games, yes The Friday the 13th game was worse

1473
01:57:27,632 --> 01:57:29,693
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean that Nightmare on Elm Street game.

1474
01:57:30,553 --> 01:57:31,774
[SPEAKER_03]: The blah blah.

1475
01:57:31,854 --> 01:57:32,174
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.

1476
01:57:32,294 --> 01:57:38,796
[SPEAKER_07]: Eric D. says Resident Evil 2 when you get to the jail cells in the basement and the dogs break out and start chasing you down some dark hallways.

1477
01:57:39,136 --> 01:57:40,397
[SPEAKER_07]: Man, that scared the crap out of me.

1478
01:57:40,457 --> 01:57:42,197
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's another one for dogs in Resident Evil.

1479
01:57:43,458 --> 01:57:43,818
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.

1480
01:57:43,898 --> 01:57:49,640
[SPEAKER_07]: Justin M. says the opening of Half-Life 2 was pretty unnerving as was the in-browser boogeyman movie tie-in game.

1481
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:52,361
[SPEAKER_07]: Scared the bejesus out of me freshman year of college.

1482
01:57:56,423 --> 01:58:03,546
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't play a lot of scary games really, but the first one that ever creeped me out was the first adventure game that I ever played, Sanitarium.

1483
01:58:04,087 --> 01:58:08,989
[SPEAKER_07]: There was a level where you were exploring an abandoned mental hospital with remnants of bodies laying around.

1484
01:58:09,309 --> 01:58:16,313
[SPEAKER_07]: The combination of this gross, empty hospital, the creepy music, and the main character's inner monologue definitely left me creeped out.

1485
01:58:16,813 --> 01:58:24,336
[SPEAKER_07]: So those are only some of the answers, and I'm sorry I didn't read them all, but those are some of the answers from our Facebook page over at facebook.com slash orange launch radio.

[SPEAKER_07]: Going to Google Plus and reading some answers there.

1488
01:58:32,579 --> 01:58:36,120
[SPEAKER_07]: The birthday boy, Actdeft, says, playing a version on PC.

1489
01:58:36,720 --> 01:58:41,082
[SPEAKER_07]: It starts out sweet and nice, and then the game starts messing with you in really freaked out ways.

1490
01:58:41,502 --> 01:58:43,443
[SPEAKER_07]: I played and finished the game in one sitting.

1491
01:58:43,703 --> 01:59:12,065
[SPEAKER_07]: but I was alone in my house and it was getting dark too so I really got scared as I progressed through it and lastly Colin M says the PC version of Slender freaked me out sometime between finding the 5th and 6th pages my flashlight had burned out and I was basically running around in the dark before the Slenderman caught me yeah Slenderman super scary game I don't know until you've played it so many times you kind of start to figure out the patterns and it's numbed a little bit but still a really good experience

1492
01:59:12,293 --> 01:59:13,954
[SPEAKER_03]: Akuma JP just made my heart leap.

1493
01:59:14,514 --> 01:59:15,955
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a Ju-on game for Wii.

1494
01:59:16,395 --> 01:59:16,975
[SPEAKER_07]: Was there really?

1495
01:59:16,995 --> 01:59:19,456
[SPEAKER_03]: And I need this in my life.

1496
01:59:19,856 --> 01:59:20,657
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah, I remember that.

1497
01:59:21,097 --> 01:59:21,797
[SPEAKER_08]: It was terrible.

1498
01:59:22,338 --> 01:59:23,058
[SPEAKER_03]: You said it was good.

1499
01:59:23,078 --> 01:59:24,419
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't you say that?

1500
01:59:24,439 --> 01:59:26,139
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I remember that came out a few years ago.

1501
01:59:26,159 --> 01:59:27,040
[SPEAKER_03]: No, you just said it was scary.

1502
01:59:27,300 --> 01:59:30,061
[SPEAKER_08]: And I remember telling everybody about that multiple times, especially you.

1503
01:59:30,081 --> 01:59:32,922
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well I don't remember that because I don't pay attention to the Wii.

1504
01:59:33,062 --> 01:59:33,543
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been a while.

1505
01:59:33,563 --> 01:59:35,303
[SPEAKER_03]: I need this in my life and I don't care how bad it is.

1506
01:59:36,784 --> 01:59:39,345
[SPEAKER_07]: I played the Project Runway game on Wii, which was pretty bad.

1507
01:59:39,385 --> 01:59:40,626
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's just a thing.

1508
01:59:40,646 --> 01:59:41,266
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to try it.

1509
01:59:41,346 --> 01:59:44,027
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember a scary moment when I thought my save file got corrupted.

1510
01:59:46,008 --> 01:59:48,189
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember another scary moment in games.

1511
01:59:48,269 --> 01:59:49,029
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, I thought of one.

1512
01:59:49,069 --> 01:59:52,751
[SPEAKER_07]: What was the Silent Hill on 360 called, the first one?

1513
01:59:52,811 --> 01:59:53,331
[SPEAKER_07]: Silent Hill...

1514
01:59:54,557 --> 01:59:54,997
[SPEAKER_07]: Homecoming?

1515
01:59:55,517 --> 01:59:56,118
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, Homecoming.

1516
01:59:56,258 --> 01:59:56,938
[SPEAKER_03]: Homecoming was good.

1517
01:59:56,958 --> 01:59:58,978
[SPEAKER_03]: With that kid.

1518
01:59:59,579 --> 02:00:03,760
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was home by myself in the dark, and it was raining outside.

1519
02:00:04,600 --> 02:00:10,702
[SPEAKER_07]: And you know how when you're in the hospital in the very beginning, a body falls just from the air duct or something?

1520
02:00:10,722 --> 02:00:11,762
[SPEAKER_07]: It just falls down in front of you?

1521
02:00:11,782 --> 02:00:13,483
[SPEAKER_07]: You go, let the bodies hit the...

1522
02:00:15,043 --> 02:00:17,304
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I screamed and jumped out of my chair.

1523
02:00:17,724 --> 02:00:20,946
[SPEAKER_07]: And because it was storming outside, the front door blew open.

1524
02:00:22,506 --> 02:00:26,708
[SPEAKER_07]: And I promptly, like you can even see, step one, ran, slammed the door.

1525
02:00:26,788 --> 02:00:29,610
[SPEAKER_07]: Step two, closed off the Xbox without even saving.

1526
02:00:29,650 --> 02:00:32,111
[SPEAKER_07]: Step three, ran into the bedroom and got under the covers and cried.

1527
02:00:32,811 --> 02:00:45,778
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't really cry, but... Lisa said it was the Xbox, because if it was, you know, the Wii or the GameCube or something, there is a potential that Rosetti may have come back and, you know, given you a nice long lecture afterwards, which is equally scary.

1528
02:00:46,038 --> 02:00:49,440
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, there is a game that I mentioned in chat that I haven't heard anyone say anything about.

1529
02:00:49,660 --> 02:00:50,020
[SPEAKER_08]: What's that?

1530
02:00:50,160 --> 02:00:50,980
[SPEAKER_03]: Phantasmagoria.

1531
02:00:51,341 --> 02:00:55,243
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, the old PC... Which I have covered as a classic game.

1532
02:00:55,263 --> 02:00:58,124
[SPEAKER_07]: Wasn't that Roberta Williams' last game or, like, one of her last games?

1533
02:00:58,144 --> 02:00:59,005
[SPEAKER_03]: I think so.

1534
02:00:59,065 --> 02:01:01,426
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, before she... But, I mean, that game was pretty...

1535
02:01:02,606 --> 02:01:04,127
[SPEAKER_07]: It was way ahead of its time.

1536
02:01:04,167 --> 02:01:05,308
[SPEAKER_07]: It was way ahead of its time.

1537
02:01:05,969 --> 02:01:08,770
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was literally on seven or eight CDs.

1538
02:01:09,351 --> 02:01:09,851
[SPEAKER_03]: It was seven.

1539
02:01:10,311 --> 02:01:11,472
[SPEAKER_07]: It was all that.

1540
02:01:12,052 --> 02:01:13,133
[SPEAKER_07]: That was during that phase.

1541
02:01:13,173 --> 02:01:14,974
[SPEAKER_07]: We had a really quick phase in gaming.

1542
02:01:14,994 --> 02:01:16,135
[SPEAKER_07]: It was right around the same time as the Sega CD.

1543
02:01:16,155 --> 02:01:16,755
[SPEAKER_03]: The full motion.

1544
02:01:17,116 --> 02:01:18,616
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, the full motion acting.

1545
02:01:19,137 --> 02:01:20,898
[SPEAKER_03]: Dan and I were actually just talking about that earlier today.

1546
02:01:21,178 --> 02:01:22,120
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1547
02:01:34,844 --> 02:01:38,746
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember on the PC you had Phantasmagoria, Seventh Guest was a huge one.

1548
02:01:38,786 --> 02:01:39,667
[SPEAKER_07]: And you're seeing that.

1549
02:01:39,707 --> 02:01:40,748
[SPEAKER_07]: They just re-released that on Steam.

1550
02:01:40,768 --> 02:01:41,968
[SPEAKER_03]: And what was the sequel, Eleventh Hour?

1551
02:01:42,108 --> 02:01:42,789
[SPEAKER_00]: Eleventh Hour.

1552
02:01:43,949 --> 02:01:47,311
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, of course, SimCity with SimCity Action News.

1553
02:01:48,072 --> 02:01:50,833
[SPEAKER_06]: Wing Commander, The X-Files was on like eight or nine days.

1554
02:01:50,853 --> 02:01:52,514
[SPEAKER_07]: Wasn't Wing Commander 3 that one?

1555
02:01:52,895 --> 02:01:53,895
[SPEAKER_07]: I only remember four.

1556
02:01:54,095 --> 02:01:55,716
[SPEAKER_03]: Wing Commander 3 was the one with Mark Hamill in it.

1557
02:01:55,736 --> 02:01:56,317
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I think so.

1558
02:01:57,157 --> 02:01:57,597
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe so.

1559
02:01:57,898 --> 02:01:58,398
[SPEAKER_03]: Gabriel Knight.

1560
02:02:00,049 --> 02:02:01,290
[SPEAKER_07]: Gabriel Knight.

1561
02:02:02,390 --> 02:02:03,571
[SPEAKER_07]: Didn't Gabriel Knight have Tim Curry?

1562
02:02:03,671 --> 02:02:04,571
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it was just Acted.

1563
02:02:04,631 --> 02:02:05,451
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe it was in the sequel.

1564
02:02:06,051 --> 02:02:13,094
[SPEAKER_03]: But I mean, there were tons of different horror games out that I'm sure scared people.

1565
02:02:13,794 --> 02:02:16,895
[SPEAKER_03]: But going back to the day, even old text games.

1566
02:02:17,315 --> 02:02:19,436
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, being eaten by a group is pretty scary.

1567
02:02:19,456 --> 02:02:20,236
[SPEAKER_07]: It is pretty scary.

1568
02:02:21,756 --> 02:02:25,838
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, let's do a few more stories in the mailbag and phone calls and all that.

1569
02:02:25,898 --> 02:02:26,398
[SPEAKER_07]: So, Loki.

1570
02:02:27,697 --> 02:02:33,341
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, so the Ouya, they changed a few things.

1571
02:02:33,641 --> 02:02:36,443
[SPEAKER_08]: One, they're redesigning the controller for the Ouya 2.

1572
02:02:36,803 --> 02:02:38,604
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, the Ouya 2 will be out next year.

1573
02:02:38,664 --> 02:02:40,205
[SPEAKER_08]: At least that's what's planned right now.

1574
02:02:41,226 --> 02:02:43,828
[SPEAKER_08]: And they're going back and redesigning the controller.

1575
02:02:43,908 --> 02:02:46,209
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, I think they've already redesigned the controller now.

1576
02:02:46,590 --> 02:02:51,833
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm kind of confused about it because I know that they redesigned the controller from when they kickstarted to when they released.

1577
02:02:52,774 --> 02:02:54,935
[SPEAKER_08]: But now they're talking about redesigning it again.

1578
02:02:55,796 --> 02:02:57,237
[SPEAKER_08]: And one of the questions was,

1579
02:02:58,058 --> 02:03:06,368
[SPEAKER_08]: So, how am I going to know if I buy an Ouya if it's going to be the one that has a redesigned controller that's supposed to be better or the older one that the controller is not so good?

1580
02:03:07,068 --> 02:03:12,315
[SPEAKER_08]: And Julie Erman said, uh, you don't know.

1581
02:03:13,536 --> 02:03:42,926
[SPEAKER_08]: so that's a great answer there's no way to distinguish that and of course they're right now planning on shipping the Ouya 2 I guess sometime in 2014 and they haven't finalized a date on it yet but they're kind of investigating right now what kind of graphics chip they want to put inside there to be able to support the older games as well as push a little bit better performance out of newer games and titles

1582
02:03:43,263 --> 02:03:52,771
[SPEAKER_06]: I understand them bringing out another console so that they can find their happy medium and find what's going to work and be relatively future-proof, but two consoles in two years?

1583
02:03:54,152 --> 02:03:56,674
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't... Oops, here's the apology.

1584
02:03:57,475 --> 02:04:02,539
[SPEAKER_06]: If they make that a trend, it just seems really stupid for something that's supposed to be an internet console.

1585
02:04:02,679 --> 02:04:03,740
[SPEAKER_06]: Aren't you an iPhone user?

1586
02:04:04,701 --> 02:04:11,166
[SPEAKER_06]: I... I'm just saying... Point, point, but I am still using my 4S.

1587
02:04:13,144 --> 02:04:18,588
[SPEAKER_03]: And keep in mind, they're all quality products as opposed to the OUYA.

1588
02:04:18,888 --> 02:04:20,970
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you don't have to buy every revision.

1589
02:04:20,990 --> 02:04:24,352
[SPEAKER_06]: They bring it forward because they have new things.

1590
02:04:24,713 --> 02:04:30,777
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm still rocking my iPad third generation, aka the one that Apple would rather you just forget about.

1591
02:04:31,098 --> 02:04:31,698
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what this is?

1592
02:04:32,358 --> 02:04:33,980
[SPEAKER_07]: The only other iPad they still sell.

1593
02:04:34,180 --> 02:04:35,621
[SPEAKER_07]: The iPad 2, right?

1594
02:04:35,661 --> 02:04:35,901
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1595
02:04:36,742 --> 02:04:37,643
[SPEAKER_07]: And all I have to say...

1596
02:04:38,283 --> 02:04:39,685
[SPEAKER_07]: To hell with the iPad Air.

1597
02:04:40,085 --> 02:04:41,967
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm still going to rock that iPad third generation.

1598
02:04:42,147 --> 02:04:42,367
[SPEAKER_07]: Do it.

1599
02:04:42,688 --> 02:04:43,128
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

1600
02:04:43,529 --> 02:04:45,551
[SPEAKER_07]: My retina display and my old school charger.

1601
02:04:45,611 --> 02:04:46,231
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all I need.

1602
02:04:46,291 --> 02:04:46,532
[SPEAKER_07]: Do it.

1603
02:04:48,581 --> 02:04:49,502
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki's like, can I finish?

1604
02:04:49,702 --> 02:04:52,823
[SPEAKER_07]: We're also talking about a $600 difference, but continue, please.

1605
02:04:52,963 --> 02:04:53,864
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, here's the thing, too.

1606
02:04:54,084 --> 02:05:00,466
[SPEAKER_08]: The problem, though, with coming out with an OUYA 2.0 or whatever is you're not coming out now first anymore.

1607
02:05:00,526 --> 02:05:07,569
[SPEAKER_08]: Now you're coming out in potentially a field where there are going to be multiple consoles out there that do the same type of thing.

1608
02:05:07,749 --> 02:05:10,210
[SPEAKER_06]: Whose features will blow yours away.

1609
02:05:10,290 --> 02:05:10,910
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.

1610
02:05:10,970 --> 02:05:15,092
[SPEAKER_08]: Who can do your thing better and for probably cheaper and...

1611
02:05:15,672 --> 02:05:18,954
[SPEAKER_08]: One of the things, you know, she's basically said, oh, hey, you know what?

1612
02:05:18,994 --> 02:05:20,736
[SPEAKER_08]: We're open to cloud gaming.

1613
02:05:20,796 --> 02:05:24,178
[SPEAKER_08]: And, hey, we're even open to our storefront being on third-party hardware.

1614
02:05:24,558 --> 02:05:25,899
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll do anything.

1615
02:05:26,179 --> 02:05:27,040
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll blow anyone.

1616
02:05:27,060 --> 02:05:30,002
[SPEAKER_07]: Why the fuck would I want to buy into you?

1617
02:05:30,042 --> 02:05:32,583
[SPEAKER_07]: We're open to putting a flashlight in the side of the console.

1618
02:05:33,564 --> 02:05:37,787
[SPEAKER_03]: And besides that, if they really wanted to be clever, they are passing up a fantastic marketing idea.

1619
02:05:38,487 --> 02:05:38,948
[SPEAKER_03]: The Tuya.

1620
02:05:39,608 --> 02:05:50,291
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just saying, I'm just saying, if they put a flashlight in the side of that console, it's going to have to be for really small dick people because that is a really small console.

1621
02:05:50,931 --> 02:05:52,732
[SPEAKER_03]: No, the flashlight will be bigger than the console.

1622
02:05:55,313 --> 02:06:01,215
[SPEAKER_08]: So what you're saying is it'll look like a giant cylinder, aka the new Mac that they have out there.

1623
02:06:01,255 --> 02:06:02,755
[SPEAKER_08]: It looks like a fucking trash can.

1624
02:06:03,593 --> 02:06:11,162
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fucking expensive.

1625
02:06:11,482 --> 02:06:13,605
[SPEAKER_08]: It does slightly better things than the last one.

1626
02:06:13,805 --> 02:06:23,777
[SPEAKER_08]: You'll release yet another computer in a year or two that will look stupid and will do something slightly better than the other one will be fucking expensive and everyone will go

1627
02:06:24,497 --> 02:06:37,660
[SPEAKER_07]: The other problem with the Ouya is that because they didn't discontinue the Wii in North America, you can get a dirt fucking cheap console here that plays a heck of a lot more games than what's really available on Ouya.

1628
02:06:37,920 --> 02:06:43,482
[SPEAKER_08]: I gotta be honest, if you're out there in the market and you're like, hell, I need a system to...

1629
02:06:44,242 --> 02:06:46,463
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for watching!

1630
02:07:06,028 --> 02:07:09,669
[SPEAKER_08]: and stuff that's in the Google Play Marketplace that's free.

1631
02:07:10,269 --> 02:07:16,590
[SPEAKER_08]: So why would you spend money on this stuff that has a locked out marketplace?

1632
02:07:17,650 --> 02:07:18,850
[SPEAKER_08]: Put it this way.

1633
02:07:18,910 --> 02:07:20,091
[SPEAKER_08]: I had the console for a while.

1634
02:07:20,511 --> 02:07:21,991
[SPEAKER_08]: There are some okay games on there.

1635
02:07:22,191 --> 02:07:24,711
[SPEAKER_08]: They're promising there's going to be more games on there that'll be good.

1636
02:07:24,971 --> 02:07:25,451
[SPEAKER_08]: But you know what?

1637
02:07:25,491 --> 02:07:28,892
[SPEAKER_08]: All those people, they're fucking not just making their games exclusive to the Wii.

1638
02:07:28,952 --> 02:07:31,413
[SPEAKER_08]: It's coming out on PC and Android and all that stuff.

1639
02:07:31,993 --> 02:07:33,833
[SPEAKER_08]: So you might as well just

1640
02:07:35,353 --> 02:07:36,014
[SPEAKER_08]: We could use a new mic.

1641
02:07:51,048 --> 02:07:54,789
[SPEAKER_08]: or buy a used OUYA, I mean, if you really want to.

1642
02:07:54,930 --> 02:07:55,350
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1643
02:07:55,450 --> 02:07:56,950
[SPEAKER_08]: I just don't see there's not a lot.

1644
02:07:57,691 --> 02:08:06,974
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no real reason why you want to get an OUYA because they were saying before, oh, you're going to be able to run XBMC on it and stuff.

1645
02:08:08,495 --> 02:08:11,556
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, except it doesn't run it very well, so why would you do that?

1646
02:08:12,156 --> 02:08:17,158
[SPEAKER_08]: You can get really cheap tablets nowadays, and a lot of them already have HDMI out.

1647
02:08:18,760 --> 02:08:20,141
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I don't know.

1648
02:08:20,702 --> 02:08:27,828
[SPEAKER_08]: Especially with the Google thing that they have now where you can plug it into your TV and more support for apps for that.

1649
02:08:28,068 --> 02:08:28,689
[SPEAKER_06]: Chromecast.

1650
02:08:28,769 --> 02:08:29,549
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, Chromecast.

1651
02:08:30,290 --> 02:08:34,934
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't really need a microconsole because a lot of other shit is doing this stuff already.

1652
02:08:35,753 --> 02:08:44,681
[SPEAKER_03]: Dan and I were talking this morning about taking, because we're probably going to eventually gut our front room computer and put it in a new frame.

1653
02:08:44,721 --> 02:08:48,705
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, well, you know people who build the Nintendo computers with the small bits?

1654
02:08:49,165 --> 02:08:51,587
[SPEAKER_03]: I've wanted to do one out of a 1950s radio.

1655
02:08:52,988 --> 02:08:58,193
[SPEAKER_03]: But I mean, you can build these things for yourself at home and they'll run whatever you need them to run within reason.

1656
02:08:58,973 --> 02:09:02,977
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, coming by parts is just a matter of smart shopping.

1657
02:09:03,374 --> 02:09:10,557
[SPEAKER_08]: Especially if you're going to make a system, if all you're interested in is emulators, you don't need that powerful of a system to run emulators.

1658
02:09:10,857 --> 02:09:12,018
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, seriously.

1659
02:09:12,518 --> 02:09:13,478
[SPEAKER_08]: Get a Dreamcast.

1660
02:09:13,699 --> 02:09:15,659
[SPEAKER_08]: Just buy a fucking old-ass PC.

1661
02:09:15,759 --> 02:09:16,940
[SPEAKER_08]: You can probably do that.

1662
02:09:17,040 --> 02:09:20,241
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, Dreamcast, but Dreamcast even, that doesn't run everything very smoothly.

1663
02:09:20,261 --> 02:09:23,583
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll run Nintendo and... You still have to go through some hoops for that, but...

1664
02:09:23,843 --> 02:09:24,984
[SPEAKER_08]: Just get an old PC.

1665
02:09:26,505 --> 02:09:30,987
[SPEAKER_03]: The front room computer that we have was pretty much given to us when someone was done with it.

1666
02:09:31,007 --> 02:09:32,648
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was Dan's mom or somebody.

1667
02:09:34,149 --> 02:09:38,452
[SPEAKER_03]: All we use it for is emulator games when we don't feel like busting out the Super Nintendo.

1668
02:09:39,352 --> 02:09:39,513
[SPEAKER_03]: And...

1669
02:09:41,687 --> 02:09:43,169
[SPEAKER_03]: Watching Netflix and Hulu.

1670
02:09:44,110 --> 02:09:44,370
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

1671
02:09:44,410 --> 02:09:53,239
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, if you're interested in buying a Ouya and, God forbid, they kickstart something else again, just remember how wonderful the Kickstarter went the first time around.

1672
02:09:53,639 --> 02:09:55,000
[SPEAKER_07]: Ask up front who's shipping.

1673
02:09:55,201 --> 02:10:02,067
[SPEAKER_08]: As in, as in right now, some people that backed that Kickstarter still don't have their fucking console yet.

1674
02:10:02,788 --> 02:10:03,329
[SPEAKER_08]: Just saying.

1675
02:10:03,409 --> 02:10:04,370
[SPEAKER_03]: And for the record...

1676
02:10:05,572 --> 02:10:07,877
[SPEAKER_03]: at Radio Shack where my husband manages.

1677
02:10:08,479 --> 02:10:14,252
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw laptops there that were fully equipped to do everything that we can do for 250 bucks.

1678
02:10:16,821 --> 02:10:20,303
[SPEAKER_03]: You can get a laptop instead of getting that piece of garbage.

1679
02:10:20,323 --> 02:10:20,823
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still not 99.

1680
02:10:20,963 --> 02:10:21,524
[SPEAKER_04]: It's still not 99.

1681
02:10:21,824 --> 02:10:22,104
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1682
02:10:22,184 --> 02:10:23,905
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but you get a lot more value.

1683
02:10:23,925 --> 02:10:25,326
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to say that the next one's going to be $99.

1684
02:10:25,366 --> 02:10:26,366
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the other thing, too.

1685
02:10:26,386 --> 02:10:27,407
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1686
02:10:27,447 --> 02:10:27,847
[SPEAKER_07]: Moving on.

1687
02:10:27,887 --> 02:10:28,347
[SPEAKER_07]: Moving on, guys.

1688
02:10:30,188 --> 02:10:38,413
[SPEAKER_07]: It's another week, so there must be another story coming out of EA somewhere that's hating on the Wii U. And here we go.

1689
02:10:38,753 --> 02:10:42,555
[SPEAKER_07]: Creative Director Craig Sullivan from Ghost Games.

1690
02:10:42,595 --> 02:10:44,316
[SPEAKER_07]: So technically it's not EA, but you know.

1691
02:10:45,377 --> 02:11:09,156
[SPEAKER_07]: So Craig Sullivan with Ghost Games is making Need for Speed Rivals and in an interview with the Six Axis talks about why it's not coming to the Wii U Rivals is going on new hardware and you have to work out where you focus your efforts The 200 people working on this game are only capable of so much and doing so many different versions of the game so we had to go with where we think the biggest audience will be for the game and that's where we are

1692
02:11:10,556 --> 02:11:33,343
[SPEAKER_07]: As you may or may not know, Need for Speed Rivals is running on the Frostbite 3 engine Earlier this year we had news that they're not going to bother with putting Frostbite 3 engine on the Wii U Back when EA kind of first was talking about how they're distancing themselves from the Wii U Because the Wii U can't handle it or whatever Which means it's not going to get Dragon Age or Mass Effect It's not going to get any of that because those are all going to be on the Frostbite 3 engine as well

1693
02:11:34,783 --> 02:11:35,404
[SPEAKER_07]: So there you go.

1694
02:11:36,784 --> 02:11:40,286
[SPEAKER_07]: Need for Speed Rivals not coming on the Wii U anytime soon.

1695
02:11:40,586 --> 02:11:45,608
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, stories like this are never really a great sign for that system.

1696
02:11:45,688 --> 02:11:51,851
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, Nintendo's going to keep pumping out their games that will carry that system well enough.

1697
02:11:52,371 --> 02:11:58,614
[SPEAKER_07]: And I also kind of think, I got to be really honest here when it kind of comes to the whole journalism element of this story.

1698
02:11:59,472 --> 02:12:28,545
[SPEAKER_07]: I kind of think in this interview you were baiting this guy to hate on the Wii U because I think when you look at a game like Need for Speed Rivals or a lot of the stuff that goes to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One you know the Wii U can't handle that stuff like you know the Wii U is based a little more off the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 granted what's in there is a little more powerful but we all kind of know that what's inside a Wii U is not the same thing that's inside these other systems

1699
02:12:29,887 --> 02:12:51,939
[SPEAKER_08]: so weren't we kind of baiting this guy a little bit isn't the answer obvious why this game is not on wii u well it's it it's like you said that they're making it for multiple consoles and so you know they only have enough okay we can only put it on x number of different consoles and so we're going to pick the ones that have you know what we think are going to be the largest market share i mean that just makes sense but yes they are masturbators

1700
02:12:53,127 --> 02:13:02,640
[SPEAKER_07]: Dark Tetsuya in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, This story frustrates me because I love Need for Speed and I want a Wii U and that customization stuff would be perfect for the touchpad.

1701
02:13:03,321 --> 02:13:07,366
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's kind of a bummer more people don't think to do it, but...

1702
02:13:08,365 --> 02:13:16,489
[SPEAKER_08]: If only the Xbox 360 had a second screen app or something that you could use the touchpad to do customization.

1703
02:13:16,910 --> 02:13:18,270
[SPEAKER_08]: If only they had that.

1704
02:13:18,370 --> 02:13:29,936
[SPEAKER_07]: Didn't you listen to Bobby's show earlier tonight when our good pal Bobby Blackwolf, who always tapes before us here at VOG Network, he was talking about he went to the Xbox One preview event in Atlanta and was asking questions about...

1705
02:13:31,477 --> 02:13:32,679
[SPEAKER_07]: Now I don't even remember the name of it.

1706
02:13:32,699 --> 02:13:33,300
[SPEAKER_07]: Smart Glass!

1707
02:13:34,161 --> 02:13:35,162
[SPEAKER_07]: I just think Smartass.

1708
02:13:35,402 --> 02:13:37,205
[SPEAKER_07]: Like Smartass, like Loki, but it's Smart Glass.

1709
02:13:37,225 --> 02:13:39,207
[SPEAKER_07]: You mean that app I downloaded that I've never used?

1710
02:13:39,287 --> 02:13:40,329
[SPEAKER_07]: They didn't even know what it was.

1711
02:13:43,001 --> 02:13:43,161
[SPEAKER_07]: Girl

1712
02:14:05,742 --> 02:14:10,650
[SPEAKER_06]: It's funny because there's a lot of opportunity in theory with the surface for stuff like that.

1713
02:14:10,770 --> 02:14:11,571
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

1714
02:14:12,613 --> 02:14:13,074
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, anyway.

1715
02:14:14,378 --> 02:14:20,983
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like you've got all this second screen technology like slapping you in the face and still nobody wants to jump on boards.

1716
02:14:21,363 --> 02:14:22,984
[SPEAKER_07]: Except Nintendo, sorta.

1717
02:14:24,105 --> 02:14:30,610
[SPEAKER_07]: Although certainly there's those wank rumors that they're thinking about releasing a new Wii that doesn't have the touchpad so they can rule the bug.

1718
02:14:30,630 --> 02:14:31,790
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's what I meant.

1719
02:14:31,810 --> 02:14:32,971
[SPEAKER_07]: The Wii U without the touchpad.

1720
02:14:32,991 --> 02:14:33,652
[SPEAKER_07]: But I don't know.

1721
02:14:34,652 --> 02:14:35,993
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, wank, wank, wank, wank, wank.

1722
02:14:37,134 --> 02:14:39,035
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know how much stock I put in there.

1723
02:14:39,055 --> 02:14:39,515
[SPEAKER_08]: Why?

1724
02:14:39,655 --> 02:14:43,617
[SPEAKER_08]: At that point, it's like, you're taking the gimmick out, so now there's no reason.

1725
02:14:46,078 --> 02:14:48,439
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, because that worked so well with the Wii Mini.

1726
02:14:48,459 --> 02:14:51,880
[SPEAKER_07]: They took out all the extra features that you didn't really need, like internet.

1727
02:14:52,401 --> 02:14:54,962
[SPEAKER_07]: Go back and focus on what made the Wii so popular.

1728
02:14:55,182 --> 02:14:57,403
[SPEAKER_07]: All the flailing with the controller.

1729
02:14:57,603 --> 02:14:57,963
[SPEAKER_07]: Why not?

1730
02:14:58,343 --> 02:14:59,524
[SPEAKER_07]: Wii Sports HD, buddy.

1731
02:14:59,864 --> 02:15:00,284
[SPEAKER_07]: It's coming.

1732
02:15:03,439 --> 02:15:09,047
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow, let's see what the listeners think in a segment we call the Mailbag.

1733
02:15:09,207 --> 02:15:10,749
[SPEAKER_07]: Every week, you guys send us emails.

1734
02:15:10,789 --> 02:15:12,792
[SPEAKER_07]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

1735
02:15:13,152 --> 02:15:19,421
[SPEAKER_07]: And DarkSakura will dive into the Mailbag headfirst and find some emails that she deems worthy.

1736
02:15:19,901 --> 02:15:21,082
[SPEAKER_07]: of being read here on the show.

1737
02:15:21,142 --> 02:15:29,327
[SPEAKER_07]: I know we... Do I gotta... We spoiled this a little bit earlier in the show with one email, but there's still plenty more unlicked, unspoiled emails to go.

1738
02:15:29,347 --> 02:15:29,667
[SPEAKER_03]: We got a bunch.

1739
02:15:29,687 --> 02:15:30,668
[SPEAKER_07]: We did get a lot tonight, didn't we?

1740
02:15:30,708 --> 02:15:33,209
[SPEAKER_03]: We got a couple more, actually, after checking the mail.

1741
02:15:33,229 --> 02:15:34,430
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, you don't have to read them all, you know.

1742
02:15:34,450 --> 02:15:35,911
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm gonna, because Gemma emailed.

1743
02:15:36,551 --> 02:15:36,831
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

1744
02:15:37,191 --> 02:15:38,092
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you can skip his.

1745
02:15:38,272 --> 02:15:38,452
[SPEAKER_07]: Shit.

1746
02:15:38,472 --> 02:15:38,953
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

1747
02:15:40,990 --> 02:15:43,151
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, Jamie, Loki, and I guess Rob.

1748
02:15:43,171 --> 02:15:43,911
[SPEAKER_07]: You see what I mean?

1749
02:15:44,131 --> 02:15:44,472
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1750
02:15:45,332 --> 02:15:52,495
[SPEAKER_03]: I heard Rob talking about Pokemon not really utilizing the 3D, and I was curious if you guys think it's even worth it to buy the 3DS or just go with the 2DS.

1751
02:15:53,095 --> 02:15:56,837
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm still trying to decide between the two, and I would love to hear what you all think.

1752
02:15:57,217 --> 02:16:00,278
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for making my unbearable weekend commutes less horrible gimmick.

1753
02:16:00,559 --> 02:16:02,259
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you wear pants with large pockets?

1754
02:16:04,440 --> 02:16:04,700
[SPEAKER_08]: No?

1755
02:16:05,201 --> 02:16:05,541
[SPEAKER_08]: 3DS.

1756
02:16:05,581 --> 02:16:06,041
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes?

1757
02:16:06,801 --> 02:16:07,141
[SPEAKER_08]: 2DS.

1758
02:16:07,522 --> 02:16:08,302
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have a man bag.

1759
02:16:08,991 --> 02:16:09,431
[SPEAKER_07]: That's true.

1760
02:16:10,311 --> 02:16:12,052
[SPEAKER_07]: Gemet probably does accessorize with a man purse.

1761
02:16:12,072 --> 02:16:15,373
[SPEAKER_08]: They do have cases for the 2DS.

1762
02:16:15,553 --> 02:16:22,714
[SPEAKER_07]: In all honesty, I still think the 3DS XL is the best system because the screens are still larger on an XL.

1763
02:16:23,315 --> 02:16:28,656
[SPEAKER_07]: And I might also be a little biased because I really want that freaking Zelda 3DS XL that's coming out.

1764
02:16:30,037 --> 02:16:32,720
[SPEAKER_07]: So I still think the XL is the best one of any of them.

1765
02:16:33,080 --> 02:16:36,784
[SPEAKER_07]: But the 2DS is not a bad alternative, and it is a much lower price.

1766
02:16:37,165 --> 02:16:43,031
[SPEAKER_07]: So you kind of have to just ask yourself, how much is A, a bigger screen, and B, 3D worth?

1767
02:16:43,392 --> 02:16:45,734
[SPEAKER_07]: Because otherwise, functionally, they're really the same system.

1768
02:16:46,855 --> 02:16:50,679
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, if all you want to do is play Pokemon...

1769
02:16:51,670 --> 02:17:14,437
[SPEAKER_03]: Then shit, get the 2DS, it doesn't really matter But if you're thinking about the future You know, the 3D does really come in handy in some games Like Super Mario 3D Land you were talking about 3D is really useful in that game I use it actually on occasion in Animal Crossing Even though I can't keep the 3D on for very long But I use it to catch flying bugs Just because sometimes it's really hard to tell Where they are in relation to where you are Without the 3D Um

1770
02:17:18,092 --> 02:17:30,060
[SPEAKER_03]: It also depends, I mean, even though I don't use the 3D, if I had a choice between the two, if someone was like, here, pick one, I'd still probably stick with the 3DS because I also like having it collapse.

1771
02:17:30,540 --> 02:17:32,161
[SPEAKER_03]: I like having it close.

1772
02:17:32,522 --> 02:17:43,569
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's always been something that I like because I actually adjust my screen level depending on if I'm sitting down and playing, if I happen to be in the car, which I don't really play that much in the car, but

1773
02:17:44,509 --> 02:17:47,870
[SPEAKER_07]: You really do have to question some of the design choices around the 2DS.

1774
02:17:47,910 --> 02:17:49,791
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it feels... It's intended for kids.

1775
02:17:50,111 --> 02:17:51,692
[SPEAKER_07]: When it's in your hands, it feels nice.

1776
02:17:51,732 --> 02:17:54,293
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, just the whole fact it doesn't close is... I don't know.

1777
02:17:54,633 --> 02:17:55,774
[SPEAKER_07]: But I get the hinges break.

1778
02:17:55,814 --> 02:17:56,834
[SPEAKER_07]: Fewer moving parts.

1779
02:17:57,194 --> 02:17:57,654
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1780
02:17:58,175 --> 02:18:01,756
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, on top of that, you have wires running in the hinges too.

1781
02:18:01,776 --> 02:18:03,036
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just like with a regular laptop.

1782
02:18:03,056 --> 02:18:03,477
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure, sure.

1783
02:18:03,577 --> 02:18:11,620
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have a lot more room to make it completely unplayable as opposed to, you know, one full put together hard plastic piece.

1784
02:18:12,296 --> 02:18:41,464
[SPEAKER_07]: so honestly Gemma you kind of just have to ask yourself like what how much is it worth like am I willing to pay that extra money to have the larger screens and have it close up and if that's really not a big deal to you and there's really only the one game you want to play on it then fuck it get a 2DS why not by the way Gemma says it's a messenger bag wait for a bundle with a design that you really really like and then buy that whatever it is 2D or 3D there is a Pokemon 3DS XL for what it's worth red and blue one or have wonderful wonderful friends like Slidekick

1785
02:18:42,270 --> 02:18:42,710
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

1786
02:18:43,431 --> 02:18:44,152
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much.

1787
02:18:44,172 --> 02:18:45,553
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the only reason I have a 3DS.

1788
02:18:46,394 --> 02:18:47,575
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for feeding my addiction.

1789
02:18:47,615 --> 02:18:47,975
[SPEAKER_03]: I love you.

1790
02:18:48,135 --> 02:18:48,856
[SPEAKER_07]: What a nice boy.

1791
02:18:49,136 --> 02:18:49,396
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1792
02:18:49,916 --> 02:18:51,198
[SPEAKER_03]: You get cookies.

1793
02:18:51,918 --> 02:18:52,539
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, Olar.

1794
02:18:52,599 --> 02:18:56,202
[SPEAKER_03]: Before I go into the meat of my email, I thought I'd update my situation with Gamerscape.

1795
02:18:56,242 --> 02:18:57,203
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Rostel UT.

1796
02:18:58,264 --> 02:19:10,334
[SPEAKER_03]: I tried to file a complaint against them with the BBB, but they didn't seem to have a site listed in their business, and I couldn't find the address or the like, which seems to be required when submitting a complaint about a business the BBB is unaware of.

1797
02:19:10,934 --> 02:19:13,275
[SPEAKER_03]: All I could get is that they're in Stockholm, Sweden.

1798
02:19:13,655 --> 02:19:16,656
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm not going to burn a chargeback over $10.

1799
02:19:16,736 --> 02:19:18,837
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure what, if anything, I can do about this.

1800
02:19:19,257 --> 02:19:24,098
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm probably just out of luck and left telling anyone who will listen to avoid that pisshole of a site.

1801
02:19:26,079 --> 02:19:28,880
[SPEAKER_07]: Views and opinions expressed by the emailer.

1802
02:19:28,940 --> 02:19:30,140
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know this site at all.

1803
02:19:30,180 --> 02:19:34,921
[SPEAKER_03]: But there are businesses that do keep foreign addresses to precisely not have to answer.

1804
02:19:37,522 --> 02:19:42,103
[SPEAKER_07]: Good on him for following up and putting his angry pen where his mouth is, so to speak.

1805
02:19:42,143 --> 02:19:49,445
[SPEAKER_03]: What was the thing that I used to quote from some study that I did in customer service, actually?

1806
02:19:50,005 --> 02:19:54,866
[SPEAKER_03]: That out of every eight people with a complaint, only one will be an advocate.

1807
02:19:56,207 --> 02:19:57,828
[SPEAKER_03]: That means only one person will do something about it.

1808
02:19:57,988 --> 02:20:00,109
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you for being an advocate.

1809
02:20:01,330 --> 02:20:04,192
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, enough of those cancers on gaming.

1810
02:20:04,292 --> 02:20:04,512
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

1811
02:20:05,253 --> 02:20:08,135
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob asked me if I consider Desura my happy alternative.

1812
02:20:08,595 --> 02:20:13,639
[SPEAKER_03]: Unlike many, I don't have a real preference when it comes to services other than they offer DRM-free games.

1813
02:20:14,059 --> 02:20:20,906
[SPEAKER_03]: Dessert is DRM agnostic, meaning they'll put games that publishers are absolutely adamant about DRM.

1814
02:20:21,286 --> 02:20:26,291
[SPEAKER_03]: However, they do make sure to let you know that if you're getting a game that needs DRM, so I know what to avoid.

1815
02:20:26,431 --> 02:20:28,813
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wish I could filter out DRM titles in search.

1816
02:20:30,395 --> 02:20:34,540
[SPEAKER_03]: Other sites I use are Indie Game Stand, GOG, and Humble Bundle.

1817
02:20:35,261 --> 02:20:43,471
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, I've just recently discovered that if a site is selling their game with the Humble widget, it can be linked to your Humble Bundle account, which greatly expands my options.

1818
02:20:43,591 --> 02:20:45,253
[SPEAKER_03]: I found a place called Bundle in a Box.

1819
02:20:45,894 --> 02:21:07,203
[SPEAKER_03]: and I haven't known of them long enough to see a bundle I want from them but I'll get back to you on that I've also looked at .emu which seems to be a GOG like service so I'll be giving them a try when I can basically I'll go wherever to get my PC games DRM free so that's my answer to Rob's question anyway I hope you guys don't mind my whining I like that he had an answer to the question so thank you

1820
02:21:07,672 --> 02:21:20,781
[SPEAKER_08]: To go back to the whole GamersGate thing, if you do a Whois search on them, just type Whois in Google, type in their URL when it pops up on the GoDaddy site, it'll give you their address right there.

1821
02:21:21,922 --> 02:21:28,166
[SPEAKER_06]: But as he said, Stockholm, Sweden, the actual company's name is apparently Paradox Interactive AB.

1822
02:21:28,967 --> 02:21:32,429
[SPEAKER_06]: There's also Lupia AB and various other things.

1823
02:21:32,869 --> 02:21:34,831
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, definitely registered overseas.

1824
02:21:35,591 --> 02:21:36,732
[SPEAKER_06]: Somewhat out of BBB reach.

1825
02:21:38,342 --> 02:21:43,344
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, P.S., when are you going to include the forums in your Fugle Question of the Week?

1826
02:21:43,524 --> 02:21:45,085
[SPEAKER_03]: I, for one, don't like social media networks.

1827
02:21:46,506 --> 02:21:56,971
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a fair question, but honestly our forums have not been very active at vognetwork.com and I just kind of think, I don't know, I wonder if maybe forums in general just aren't really a thing these days.

1828
02:21:57,091 --> 02:21:59,633
[SPEAKER_07]: What in general would get people to participate more in the forums?

1829
02:21:59,653 --> 02:22:00,553
[SPEAKER_03]: Change it to a BBS.

1830
02:22:01,234 --> 02:22:01,514
[SPEAKER_03]: Like a...

1831
02:22:02,114 --> 02:22:30,039
[SPEAKER_07]: Like a, you know, or do it Reddit style I am all for setting up a VOG Network BBS Where we could play games like Legend of the Red Dragon Actually, I would so be down for that That would be awesome But that has nothing to do with a freaking PHP BB So I don't know I mean, I guess, you know, the obvious answer is Well, Rob, try posting that on the forums and see what happens Or I'm also going to be honest Most of the questions I think of the day of the show And a large part of that is that we don't always know all the news Until the day of the show

1832
02:22:31,120 --> 02:22:33,702
[SPEAKER_07]: So you wouldn't have a lot of time, and that's one concern I have.

1833
02:22:34,042 --> 02:22:39,907
[SPEAKER_07]: And Facebook and Google, whether you love them or hate them, are always very immediate.

1834
02:22:40,547 --> 02:22:44,831
[SPEAKER_07]: People check their news feed all the time and so forth, so that's what makes it attractive.

1835
02:22:45,316 --> 02:22:58,183
[SPEAKER_03]: However, as a suggestion, and I myself am doing something similar, if you happen to see something from a Fugle question of the week and you feel would make a good personal editorial, why not try to submit some content?

1836
02:22:58,503 --> 02:22:59,763
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.

1837
02:22:59,803 --> 02:23:03,425
[SPEAKER_03]: Send us an article if you have something to say about something that's been a Fugle question.

1838
02:23:04,026 --> 02:23:11,569
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, assuming it's not full of accusing too many people or companies of being cancers on gaming, we might publish it.

1839
02:23:11,649 --> 02:23:11,810
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1840
02:23:13,130 --> 02:23:18,691
[SPEAKER_03]: We do want a little bit more diplomacy in things on our site.

1841
02:23:18,771 --> 02:23:20,131
[SPEAKER_07]: And BlackWolf does have a good point.

1842
02:23:20,171 --> 02:23:21,732
[SPEAKER_07]: You get more than enough answers anyway.

1843
02:23:21,972 --> 02:23:23,972
[SPEAKER_07]: Tonight, we just had too many answers to read.

1844
02:23:24,052 --> 02:23:34,975
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd still be reading them right now, which, don't get me wrong, love you guys for participating, but part of it is, too, that I want everybody to be able to go read all the answers themselves and just hear me rattle them off.

1845
02:23:35,755 --> 02:23:37,035
[SPEAKER_06]: And three-hour show.

1846
02:23:37,695 --> 02:23:39,256
[SPEAKER_07]: A three-hour show with news and not.

1847
02:24:01,650 --> 02:24:02,491
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, Loki,

1848
02:24:17,509 --> 02:24:25,156
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a new MMO space sim coming out from Chris Roberts and as of this email, it has raised over $24 million through pure crowdfunding.

1849
02:24:25,697 --> 02:24:28,379
[SPEAKER_03]: The game looks like it's going to be amazing and has a ton of backers.

1850
02:24:28,719 --> 02:24:33,244
[SPEAKER_03]: Chris Roberts is looking to make a PC game to push the PC to its limit.

1851
02:24:34,104 --> 02:24:41,131
[SPEAKER_03]: Check it out at RobertsSpaceIndustries.com So that's RobertsSpaceIndustries.com

1852
02:24:42,652 --> 02:24:46,755
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, thanks for the podcast and I hope to be able to join the live stream at some point soon.

1853
02:24:46,955 --> 02:24:47,395
[SPEAKER_03]: Duran.

1854
02:24:47,876 --> 02:24:49,096
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I saw that name in chat tonight.

1855
02:24:49,497 --> 02:24:50,057
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, Duran.

1856
02:24:50,097 --> 02:24:50,777
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm glad you're here.

1857
02:24:51,178 --> 02:24:52,879
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm sorry for being disgusting in part A.

1858
02:25:00,545 --> 02:25:04,969
[SPEAKER_07]: I did not recognize the game that was being discussed there, but Jason, you raised your hand.

1859
02:25:04,989 --> 02:25:05,630
[SPEAKER_07]: You were like, yes, yes.

1860
02:25:05,930 --> 02:25:06,511
[SPEAKER_06]: I did.

1861
02:25:06,951 --> 02:25:17,761
[SPEAKER_06]: I adore this game because Wing Commander is one of the few dogfights in space or air that's been one of my absolute favorite series for the most part.

1862
02:25:18,601 --> 02:25:27,968
[SPEAKER_06]: But Chris Roberts is, you know, everybody has one specific individual that a game or a company or somebody is known for in large part.

1863
02:25:28,108 --> 02:25:31,170
[SPEAKER_06]: And Chris Roberts is the guy for Wing Commander.

1864
02:25:31,590 --> 02:25:34,992
[SPEAKER_06]: And so he's creating a space dogfight MMO.

1865
02:25:35,793 --> 02:25:37,274
[SPEAKER_06]: No MMO has grabbed me so far.

1866
02:25:37,394 --> 02:25:44,679
[SPEAKER_06]: I played both Final Fantasy XI and WoW to like level 8 or 9 on my characters.

1867
02:25:45,179 --> 02:25:47,501
[SPEAKER_06]: A couple days worth of playing never really went beyond that.

1868
02:25:48,241 --> 02:25:50,123
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for watching!

1869
02:26:06,736 --> 02:26:07,276
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1870
02:26:36,876 --> 02:26:37,938
[SPEAKER_06]: Do things for your faction.

1871
02:26:45,970 --> 02:27:13,292
[SPEAKER_06]: it's unbelievable in a 3D universe of a game when you have all your controls in front of you in the form of a joystick and however much rudder or throttle or anything else that you have it has sounded amazing, I am a backer the shirt that I got is actually one of the most comfortable shirts I own right now which is very interesting but I have my badge, my ID tag it's looked absolutely phenomenal

1872
02:27:14,573 --> 02:27:34,215
[SPEAKER_03]: or release sometime 2014 sorry Dungeon Buster said in a chat Roberts also did Freelancer when he had digital anvil and players essentially turned into a mini MMO with a number of mods added to it over the years and Duran just said Oculus support is confirmed nice Tim Tripp it sounds like Eve without the spreadsheets yes that is 100% correct

1873
02:27:36,214 --> 02:27:39,116
[SPEAKER_07]: Looking at some other comments in chat real quick on Star Citizen.

1874
02:27:39,156 --> 02:27:42,738
[SPEAKER_07]: Tim Tripp says, Star Citizen is the only game I've ever crowdsourced.

1875
02:27:43,199 --> 02:27:45,900
[SPEAKER_07]: And Dungeon Buster says, Star Citizen is still on the fence with that one.

1876
02:27:45,940 --> 02:27:47,361
[SPEAKER_07]: Not too keen on the MMO elements.

1877
02:27:49,142 --> 02:27:49,623
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

1878
02:27:49,643 --> 02:27:51,344
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, moving back into the email land.

1879
02:27:51,384 --> 02:27:52,044
[SPEAKER_03]: We have three.

1880
02:27:53,632 --> 02:27:54,292
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, OLR.

1881
02:27:55,373 --> 02:28:02,915
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a fleeting thought the other day about how video games are constantly compared to movies as they seem to be aligning more and more in terms of narrative and visual fidelity.

1882
02:28:03,195 --> 02:28:05,316
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for using fidelity in an email.

1883
02:28:05,376 --> 02:28:07,257
[SPEAKER_03]: That makes me feel, have a little hope.

1884
02:28:08,097 --> 02:28:11,138
[SPEAKER_03]: And there is a point of differentiation that I found interesting.

1885
02:28:11,678 --> 02:28:16,360
[SPEAKER_03]: If a movie is considered a critical and commercial success, it's typically given many sequels.

1886
02:28:16,800 --> 02:28:22,882
[SPEAKER_03]: With this, the original film seems more often than not become viewed as superior and pure version of the franchise as a whole.

1887
02:28:23,582 --> 02:28:26,884
[SPEAKER_03]: Why is this not the same with video games that they are so closely connected to films?

1888
02:28:27,464 --> 02:28:35,927
[SPEAKER_03]: When a video game enjoys mass success, it is given a sequel and almost instantly the original game is rendered obsolete due to the improved build of the game, engine, better graphics control, etc.

1889
02:28:36,488 --> 02:28:37,768
[SPEAKER_03]: Curious to know your thoughts on this.

1890
02:28:37,908 --> 02:28:41,030
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to put in right now and I'm going to use Mass Effect as my thing, so don't judge me.

1891
02:28:41,970 --> 02:28:42,250
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1892
02:28:43,451 --> 02:28:46,132
[SPEAKER_03]: First Mass Effect, better story-wise than the later two.

1893
02:28:46,292 --> 02:28:46,612
[SPEAKER_07]: Really?

1894
02:28:47,272 --> 02:28:48,373
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't agree with that, but okay.

1895
02:28:48,393 --> 02:28:48,473
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1896
02:28:50,596 --> 02:29:13,319
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that it was when you're introducing different writing teams and the story changes dramatically from the direction it was going in that's when I have some concerns but as far as playing the game Mass Effect 3 is lots of fun I have way much more fun actually just playing the game than I do the first Mass Effect especially since the Mako makes me want to puke

1897
02:29:13,539 --> 02:29:18,642
[SPEAKER_07]: So if I'm understanding the question right, they want to know when the original is better than the sequel.

1898
02:29:18,982 --> 02:29:23,145
[SPEAKER_07]: Because in movies, it tends to be that the original is better than the sequel, right?

1899
02:29:23,325 --> 02:29:23,906
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1900
02:29:24,106 --> 02:29:29,989
[SPEAKER_07]: Very rarely are sequels as good as the original unless you're talking about, I don't know, like The Godfather or Star Wars.

1901
02:29:30,330 --> 02:29:32,231
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, well, Star Wars and so on.

1902
02:29:33,071 --> 02:29:39,357
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of times, too, that when you have a movie come out, typically sequels are done... I mean, except for when they're planned as trilogies.

1903
02:29:39,417 --> 02:29:40,798
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, Star Wars.

1904
02:29:41,499 --> 02:29:46,023
[SPEAKER_03]: The only three in existence in my brain, in my universe, headcanon.

1905
02:29:47,424 --> 02:29:51,588
[SPEAKER_03]: Those tell a good story, and they're a cohesive unit.

1906
02:29:52,089 --> 02:29:54,491
[SPEAKER_03]: Kill Bill was intended to be a full movie.

1907
02:29:55,812 --> 02:29:57,513
[SPEAKER_03]: And the two parts are different enough.

1908
02:29:57,854 --> 02:29:57,974
[SPEAKER_04]: Mm-hmm.

1909
02:29:58,331 --> 02:30:00,192
[SPEAKER_03]: but they are a cohesive story.

1910
02:30:00,232 --> 02:30:04,616
[SPEAKER_03]: When you have sequels that are made as cash cows, you know, oh, well, this movie did good.

1911
02:30:04,656 --> 02:30:06,037
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see if we can make some more money.

1912
02:30:06,057 --> 02:30:07,098
[SPEAKER_07]: The Hangover Part 2 and 3.

1913
02:30:07,758 --> 02:30:08,018
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck.

1914
02:30:08,038 --> 02:30:08,879
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, right.

1915
02:30:09,259 --> 02:30:15,504
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, I think like one of the few movies that have actually done that successfully is like the American Pie series.

1916
02:30:15,524 --> 02:30:19,967
[SPEAKER_03]: Those have all been kind of funny in their own bizarrely... The Scream movies.

1917
02:30:20,087 --> 02:30:22,249
[SPEAKER_07]: Not everybody likes the sequels as much as I do, but...

1918
02:30:22,389 --> 02:30:24,330
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you actually seen all of the American Pies?

1919
02:30:24,850 --> 02:30:27,311
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen two and part of three.

1920
02:30:27,331 --> 02:30:28,212
[SPEAKER_06]: There are seven.

1921
02:30:28,552 --> 02:30:28,772
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

1922
02:30:29,212 --> 02:30:30,913
[SPEAKER_07]: Direct-to-video ones are awful, though.

1923
02:30:30,973 --> 02:30:31,513
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's be real.

1924
02:30:31,973 --> 02:30:32,534
[SPEAKER_07]: Just saying.

1925
02:30:32,574 --> 02:30:33,134
[SPEAKER_07]: They exist.

1926
02:30:33,734 --> 02:30:35,015
[SPEAKER_03]: I did want to watch the band count thing.

1927
02:30:35,035 --> 02:30:39,577
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's go back to Dude's question because it could be female.

1928
02:30:39,937 --> 02:30:44,039
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, but I don't know based on names if y'all are male or female.

1929
02:30:44,179 --> 02:30:46,860
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a traditionally masculine name, but it could go the other way.

1930
02:30:46,960 --> 02:30:47,360
[SPEAKER_07]: You never know.

1931
02:30:48,480 --> 02:30:58,043
[SPEAKER_07]: So what the emailer said there, I think the question really was, have you played a video game where the sequel was not as good as the original?

1932
02:30:59,144 --> 02:31:01,204
[SPEAKER_07]: I almost used this as the kickoff topic tonight.

1933
02:31:01,224 --> 02:31:05,626
[SPEAKER_07]: The other one was a little more themed for Halloween, but I thought this was a great question too.

1934
02:31:05,666 --> 02:31:12,328
[SPEAKER_03]: I was hoping I could hear from the three of you if there are any game series you can think of where you consider the first game to be a superior version despite multiple sequels.

1935
02:31:13,172 --> 02:31:18,135
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I have a... I had to really think about this, but I have a great answer, I think, for this.

1936
02:31:18,795 --> 02:31:21,676
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to go retro, really retro, but Blaster Master.

1937
02:31:22,257 --> 02:31:23,617
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah.

1938
02:31:23,637 --> 02:31:28,360
[SPEAKER_07]: The original was superior to anything that came out after it, like that horrible Genesis one.

1939
02:31:28,460 --> 02:31:29,580
[SPEAKER_03]: But it had a better Japanese game.

1940
02:31:30,041 --> 02:31:31,601
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it Space Fight Hyperion?

1941
02:31:31,641 --> 02:31:35,163
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but Blaster Master was the answer that came to my mind.

1942
02:31:35,183 --> 02:31:38,745
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if you guys... I had more time to think about it, but you guys... Excite Truck.

1943
02:31:39,986 --> 02:31:40,426
[SPEAKER_07]: Ha ha ha!

1944
02:31:40,766 --> 02:31:41,967
[SPEAKER_07]: You're on that kick again.

1945
02:31:42,307 --> 02:31:45,388
[SPEAKER_03]: Tim Tripp actually makes a good point and this is something I was going to bring up as well.

1946
02:31:45,948 --> 02:31:49,930
[SPEAKER_03]: Typically the first game in a new IP doesn't receive the budget that an established IP.

1947
02:31:50,450 --> 02:31:54,932
[SPEAKER_03]: So the big difference that comes in the amount of risk inherent in creating a new IP versus a new movie IP.

1948
02:31:56,392 --> 02:32:23,762
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that is a great point and I think it's very true with games but to be fair it's also true to some extent with movies and I would point out those movies that they've made a million of like Saw as much as I hate those movies there's that right and then there's American Pie sorry Paranormal Activity you know the first one was made for like what a quarter like they smashed some kids piggy bank and made a movie with the money that was in it but then the others got like more and more budgets later on

1949
02:32:24,042 --> 02:32:26,624
[SPEAKER_07]: Dragon Age 2 better than the first one so far so far

1950
02:32:52,501 --> 02:32:54,762
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that's a good answer, though, to the question, Dragon Age.

1951
02:32:57,364 --> 02:32:59,845
[SPEAKER_07]: I did see Saw 1 for whoever asked in chat.

1952
02:32:59,885 --> 02:33:00,345
[SPEAKER_07]: I saw Saw 1.

1953
02:33:00,425 --> 02:33:01,426
[SPEAKER_07]: I refused to watch any of the others.

1954
02:33:01,966 --> 02:33:04,407
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a feeling that they always knew how it was going to end.

1955
02:33:05,268 --> 02:33:07,549
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think they tied it together that way.

1956
02:33:07,609 --> 02:33:08,929
[SPEAKER_07]: They always knew how it was going to end.

1957
02:33:09,650 --> 02:33:14,012
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there's a... And actually, I thought about it, but someone in chat mentioned it, too.

1958
02:33:14,792 --> 02:33:16,133
[SPEAKER_03]: Android... Is that Alan?

1959
02:33:16,173 --> 02:33:17,254
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Alan on his phone.

1960
02:33:17,434 --> 02:33:18,474
[SPEAKER_07]: He's on light rail right now.

1961
02:33:18,574 --> 02:33:19,075
[SPEAKER_03]: Devil May Cry.

1962
02:33:20,995 --> 02:33:21,655
[SPEAKER_03]: The first one was better.

1963
02:33:22,456 --> 02:33:23,896
[SPEAKER_03]: In my opinion, I liked it a lot better.

1964
02:33:26,376 --> 02:33:28,577
[SPEAKER_07]: I am also tempted to say Silent Hill.

1965
02:33:29,197 --> 02:33:33,238
[SPEAKER_07]: I think in some ways the first game is superior to anything that came after it.

1966
02:33:33,338 --> 02:33:34,958
[SPEAKER_03]: Its limitations actually made it creepier.

1967
02:33:35,218 --> 02:33:40,419
[SPEAKER_07]: However, Silent Hill 2 is kind of the climax of that whole series.

1968
02:33:41,439 --> 02:33:44,200
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, that's a sequel, but how many Silent Hills have there been after that?

1969
02:33:44,910 --> 02:33:45,330
[SPEAKER_03]: Too many.

1970
02:33:45,430 --> 02:33:46,051
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no, no.

1971
02:33:46,291 --> 02:33:48,012
[SPEAKER_03]: There have only been a few Silent Hill games.

1972
02:33:48,052 --> 02:33:49,533
[SPEAKER_03]: The others are fakes.

1973
02:33:49,853 --> 02:33:50,033
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1974
02:33:50,473 --> 02:33:52,234
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, they don't exist in my in my universe.

1975
02:33:52,434 --> 02:33:53,655
[SPEAKER_07]: That was a fantastic question.

1976
02:33:54,035 --> 02:33:59,538
[SPEAKER_07]: I would actually invite if you know, we do comments on this show every week at VOG Network dot com.

1977
02:33:59,858 --> 02:34:02,859
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'd really invite you if you want to leave a comment.

1978
02:34:03,280 --> 02:34:05,581
[SPEAKER_07]: And if your answer is good, I will get or like, you know,

1979
02:34:06,861 --> 02:34:23,370
[SPEAKER_07]: of course Shane Pipeson I'll be very easy on you with this but I'll give you a thumbs up guaranteed so you get a little point on vognetwork.com if you have an answer to this question leave it on the episode posting at vognetwork.com for you podcast listeners because I want to know what games do you believe had better initial games than the sequels

1980
02:34:23,590 --> 02:34:41,544
[SPEAKER_03]: See, Shane ranks the Silent Hill games as 2-4-1-3 I beg to differ 3-2-4-1 Now take that back, 3-2-1-4 Shane, admittedly, you value the room way more than a lot of people do The room wasn't supposed to be a Silent Hill game Remember?

1981
02:34:42,605 --> 02:34:48,270
[SPEAKER_03]: I loved the E3 booth that they had for that game Yeah, that was my first Like the kitchen and everything?

1982
02:34:48,450 --> 02:34:52,093
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god, that was awesome So, yeah, we still have more email

1983
02:34:52,867 --> 02:34:53,188
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay!

1984
02:34:54,431 --> 02:34:55,935
[SPEAKER_07]: We didn't need three extra stories.

1985
02:34:55,975 --> 02:34:57,819
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got three extra emails tonight and that's fine.

1986
02:34:57,879 --> 02:34:58,721
[SPEAKER_07]: Every gamer gets a voice.

1987
02:35:00,024 --> 02:35:01,045
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey guys, Sterlok here.

1988
02:35:01,345 --> 02:35:01,826
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi Sterlok.

1989
02:35:02,566 --> 02:35:08,151
[SPEAKER_03]: With Halloween mere days away, I had a question to pose to both the hosts and listeners.

1990
02:35:08,792 --> 02:35:13,696
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to know what game you can't finish due to one scene that spoils the rest of the game for you.

1991
02:35:14,177 --> 02:35:15,418
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll give you my example.

1992
02:35:15,578 --> 02:35:21,923
[SPEAKER_03]: Near the beginning of Homefront, there's a scene in which the child's parents are killed right in front of him and the child is seen crying for several seconds.

1993
02:35:22,484 --> 02:35:25,587
[SPEAKER_03]: Even though I'm fairly certain no other such scenes exist in the game...

1994
02:35:26,047 --> 02:35:31,252
[SPEAKER_03]: It completely kills the desire for me to see the rest of the game because that scene is just too disturbing for me to watch.

1995
02:35:31,793 --> 02:35:35,036
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to know if anyone else had similar experiences with any games out there.

1996
02:35:35,176 --> 02:35:36,437
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep being awesome, Starlock.

1997
02:35:36,457 --> 02:35:37,539
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a movie that does that for me.

1998
02:35:38,520 --> 02:35:39,300
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't watch Face Off.

1999
02:35:41,322 --> 02:35:49,230
[SPEAKER_06]: I never played more than the start of Silent Hill 4 because the opening cinematic and the ambience just kind of completely creeped me out.

2000
02:35:50,191 --> 02:36:19,331
[SPEAKER_06]: I think my head was just kind of in a weird place that afternoon and I think I literally just finished Silent Hill 3, moved on to Silent Hill 4 but I saw the opening cinematic which did the whole world shifting I did start the game, I did get control, I went to the window and I looked outside and saw the other apartment across the way, whatever but I never touched the game beyond that because for whatever reason the ambience just seemed too much for my brain and I put it down and never picked it back up again

2001
02:36:21,565 --> 02:36:28,449
[SPEAKER_07]: If my name was Bobby Blackwolf, I might say, well, I played the demo to Ni No Kuni and then that scared me off for the rest of the game.

2002
02:36:28,890 --> 02:36:34,193
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I can only think of a funny answer because I can't think of a serious one because I didn't see this email in advance.

2003
02:36:34,213 --> 02:36:34,853
[SPEAKER_07]: It must have come in late.

2004
02:36:36,794 --> 02:36:37,335
[SPEAKER_07]: I really don't know.

2005
02:36:37,355 --> 02:36:41,037
[SPEAKER_07]: A game where a scene... Does it have to be disturbing or just it was bad?

2006
02:36:41,177 --> 02:36:42,918
[SPEAKER_07]: Like there was something so bad happened.

2007
02:36:42,938 --> 02:36:47,741
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the question, well, disturbing, bad, something that affected you in a way that made you not want to finish it.

2008
02:36:50,843 --> 02:36:54,848
[SPEAKER_03]: Like me in the scene in Legend that I can't get past and have never finished the movie.

2009
02:36:55,148 --> 02:36:55,588
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah.

2010
02:36:56,249 --> 02:36:57,050
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I'm talking about?

2011
02:36:57,090 --> 02:36:57,491
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I do.

2012
02:36:57,591 --> 02:37:00,974
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm trying to think if I have anything that's kind of like trigger-ish like that.

2013
02:37:03,075 --> 02:37:08,680
[SPEAKER_03]: And for the record, I don't think I could play the game for exactly the same reason because it's kind of a very horrible thing for me.

2014
02:37:08,981 --> 02:37:09,861
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't think of something.

2015
02:37:09,902 --> 02:37:14,486
[SPEAKER_07]: If I think of something, I'll have to answer it on VOG Network or something because I really can't think of anything.

2016
02:37:14,546 --> 02:37:15,947
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, can you think of anything?

2017
02:37:17,188 --> 02:37:19,310
[SPEAKER_03]: When you put in Excitebots and found it wasn't Psych Truck?

2018
02:37:20,491 --> 02:37:30,598
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, yeah, it was the first Mexico track, and you're playing it, and then the game asks you to throw a pie at a clown, and I was like, what the fuck is this?

2019
02:37:32,279 --> 02:37:36,382
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't think of anything that really had a scene in the game that kind of ruined it for me.

2020
02:37:37,443 --> 02:37:42,206
[SPEAKER_08]: I can think of a lot of games where you play through it, and the end is kind of lame.

2021
02:37:43,755 --> 02:37:45,016
[SPEAKER_08]: And that kind of ruined it for me.

2022
02:37:45,156 --> 02:37:46,937
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like, shit, why did I play this game?

2023
02:37:46,957 --> 02:37:48,898
[SPEAKER_08]: This ending is fucking terrible.

2024
02:37:49,659 --> 02:37:56,443
[SPEAKER_08]: But no, I can't think of anything that's like there's been something in the middle of the game, like a story thing where I just kind of went, what?

2025
02:37:56,663 --> 02:37:57,643
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't like this.

2026
02:37:57,823 --> 02:37:59,704
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to quit this game.

2027
02:38:01,125 --> 02:38:03,707
[SPEAKER_07]: Tim Tripp in chat says, I watched The Descent once.

2028
02:38:03,947 --> 02:38:06,308
[SPEAKER_07]: It was amazing, but I can never watch it again.

2029
02:38:06,949 --> 02:38:12,232
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I've definitely seen a lot of movies like that where it's like, I'm glad I saw it once and I will never watch that again.

2030
02:38:12,512 --> 02:38:15,974
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a movie I can say I wasn't glad that I saw it, even though I didn't have to pay for it.

2031
02:38:16,555 --> 02:38:17,575
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was Drag Me to Hell.

2032
02:38:17,956 --> 02:38:18,956
[SPEAKER_03]: I went with Tiara to see it.

2033
02:38:19,417 --> 02:38:19,937
[SPEAKER_03]: She loved it.

2034
02:38:20,517 --> 02:38:22,699
[SPEAKER_03]: I just thought it was gross and not very good.

2035
02:38:22,719 --> 02:38:24,460
[SPEAKER_08]: I watched Movie 43 the other day.

2036
02:38:24,800 --> 02:38:26,882
[SPEAKER_08]: Very disappointed that that movie was not funny.

2037
02:38:29,183 --> 02:38:31,785
[SPEAKER_08]: They showed you all the funny stuff in the trailer.

2038
02:38:31,985 --> 02:38:38,589
[SPEAKER_08]: It did have a cameo, though, of Band Fuse, a game that will unfortunately sorely fail when it comes out in November.

2039
02:38:38,690 --> 02:38:42,272
[SPEAKER_08]: But it had a cameo, so there's a bullet point for that.

2040
02:38:42,452 --> 02:39:09,137
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm trying to see if the chatters have any they're still doing the Silent Hill debate in chat so there's not a lot of comments on it but Dungeon Buster does say I couldn't get past the bad full motion video acting in a PC game once well the gameplay was also pretty terrible too but he didn't say what game it was so I don't know but chatters if you have any answers to it let us know there was a game that I remember playing for a while that had something that made me super nauseous and I couldn't touch the game for a little while but then I went back I mean

2041
02:39:10,856 --> 02:39:14,980
[SPEAKER_03]: I've had things that just shake me up right away and I'd have trouble finishing the scene.

2042
02:39:16,121 --> 02:39:20,545
[SPEAKER_03]: And then once I digested it for a few days, I could go back and play it and be fine.

2043
02:39:20,585 --> 02:39:21,826
[SPEAKER_03]: But I can't remember the last one.

2044
02:39:21,846 --> 02:39:27,751
[SPEAKER_08]: I kind of didn't like the beginning of Alone in the Dark, the original Alone in the Dark, because it was hard.

2045
02:39:28,752 --> 02:39:29,753
[SPEAKER_08]: That's about it.

2046
02:39:30,453 --> 02:39:32,255
[SPEAKER_08]: Once again, nothing content related.

2047
02:39:32,615 --> 02:39:32,855
[SPEAKER_04]: Mm hmm.

2048
02:39:33,576 --> 02:39:38,786
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, fuck, there was the torture scene in Grand Theft Auto V, and I was just like, how do I gold this thing?

2049
02:39:38,806 --> 02:39:42,794
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I don't want to have to play this boring minigame again.

2050
02:39:44,537 --> 02:39:46,120
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, that's kind of brutal too, I guess.

2051
02:39:47,535 --> 02:39:47,915
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2052
02:39:48,075 --> 02:39:50,597
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, if I think of something later, I'll let you know.

2053
02:39:50,637 --> 02:39:51,538
[SPEAKER_07]: That was a good question, though.

2054
02:39:51,698 --> 02:39:51,938
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

2055
02:39:52,458 --> 02:39:53,199
[SPEAKER_03]: Last email.

2056
02:39:53,519 --> 02:39:54,279
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe it's last.

2057
02:39:54,439 --> 02:39:55,660
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the last as far as I'm concerned.

2058
02:39:55,860 --> 02:39:56,481
[SPEAKER_07]: Last for tonight.

2059
02:39:56,801 --> 02:39:57,261
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, folks.

2060
02:39:57,301 --> 02:39:57,921
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Ragenator.

2061
02:39:58,402 --> 02:40:02,744
[SPEAKER_03]: Seeing as tonight's episode is the last one before Halloween is spelled with an A, dude.

2062
02:40:03,125 --> 02:40:03,505
[SPEAKER_03]: Halloween.

2063
02:40:05,066 --> 02:40:06,927
[SPEAKER_03]: God, he misspelled it twice.

2064
02:40:07,147 --> 02:40:08,368
[SPEAKER_03]: He spelled it Halloween.

2065
02:40:08,908 --> 02:40:15,172
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, Hollow Man is a very good... Okay, it's a movie that came... I thought I'd send a Halloween theme to you.

2066
02:40:15,272 --> 02:40:16,393
[SPEAKER_08]: It is all Hallows' Eve.

2067
02:40:18,052 --> 02:40:18,612
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello.

2068
02:40:19,193 --> 02:40:19,553
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello.

2069
02:40:19,753 --> 02:40:28,498
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that since we're all pretty much in the same age group, around 35 plus or minus six years, we don't... We are age-inator.

2070
02:40:28,518 --> 02:40:30,019
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know about the listeners, but okay.

2071
02:40:30,299 --> 02:40:31,940
[SPEAKER_03]: We all don't go trick-or-treating anymore.

2072
02:40:32,040 --> 02:40:32,380
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, we do.

2073
02:40:32,800 --> 02:40:33,781
[SPEAKER_03]: And haven't done so in years.

2074
02:40:33,921 --> 02:40:34,301
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, we have.

2075
02:40:34,361 --> 02:40:35,302
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck that shit.

2076
02:40:35,922 --> 02:40:37,983
[SPEAKER_07]: The Disneyland party is off the hook.

2077
02:40:38,383 --> 02:40:40,344
[SPEAKER_03]: And for the record, some of us might have kids.

2078
02:40:41,305 --> 02:40:43,226
[SPEAKER_03]: So they go trick-or-treating with their kids.

2079
02:40:43,286 --> 02:40:45,027
[SPEAKER_07]: Who do you think eats all the candy in the middle of the night?

2080
02:40:45,247 --> 02:40:45,607
[SPEAKER_03]: Mom!

2081
02:40:45,627 --> 02:40:46,027
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean...

2082
02:40:47,328 --> 02:41:10,326
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't eat all the candy I just go to Becky's house and take Julian's I mean, Becky, if you're listening, I'm not going to steal Julian's candy If you're listening, I'm not going to take Julian's candy Science, they keep giving them those stupid peanut butter cups Those things fucking suck My opinion, of course, everyone else likes peanut butter cups I know, whatever, everyone else likes that shit, but not me Tick and ten, you keep misspelling Halloween God, this is fucking irritating

2083
02:41:11,949 --> 02:41:13,830
[SPEAKER_03]: But we may have certain Halloween traditions.

2084
02:41:13,930 --> 02:41:16,312
[SPEAKER_03]: For me, it's watching movies that would be Halloween appropriate.

2085
02:41:16,792 --> 02:41:18,193
[SPEAKER_03]: Alien, Aliens, Monster Squad.

2086
02:41:18,213 --> 02:41:19,553
[SPEAKER_03]: God, I fucking love the Monster Squad.

2087
02:41:19,794 --> 02:41:20,234
[SPEAKER_07]: Showgirls.

2088
02:41:21,294 --> 02:41:21,555
[SPEAKER_03]: Girl.

2089
02:41:21,815 --> 02:41:22,175
[SPEAKER_07]: Fist bump.

2090
02:41:22,435 --> 02:41:24,016
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

2091
02:41:24,036 --> 02:41:24,516
[SPEAKER_03]: Ghostbusters, etc.

2092
02:41:24,536 --> 02:41:25,237
[SPEAKER_03]: You are a whore, darling.

2093
02:41:25,977 --> 02:41:26,698
[SPEAKER_03]: Y'all know shit.

2094
02:41:30,440 --> 02:41:31,881
[SPEAKER_03]: I could do the hand thing, but I'm holding a mic.

2095
02:41:32,601 --> 02:41:33,842
[SPEAKER_03]: And the same goes with games.

2096
02:41:34,442 --> 02:41:36,443
[SPEAKER_03]: Nightmare Creatures, Resident Evil 1 through 3, blah.

2097
02:41:36,723 --> 02:41:37,304
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, etc.

2098
02:41:37,824 --> 02:41:40,346
[SPEAKER_03]: Now my question for you is, do you do anything at all similar?

2099
02:41:40,366 --> 02:41:40,406
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

2100
02:41:44,105 --> 02:42:06,685
[SPEAKER_07]: I sit at home and throw candy at kids I don't know about this year, we're going to something I know a lot of people did their Halloween party this weekend, like last night But we got invited to one that's after Halloween, so we're doing that And my costume that we bought the other day is for that But I don't know about on Halloween itself this year

2101
02:42:07,105 --> 02:42:09,066
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe I'll try to invite some people over to watch Showgirls.

2102
02:42:09,226 --> 02:42:09,706
[SPEAKER_07]: That'll be fun.

2103
02:42:10,467 --> 02:42:11,147
[SPEAKER_07]: Or I'll go to Jamie's.

2104
02:42:11,687 --> 02:42:12,127
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

2105
02:42:12,327 --> 02:42:13,328
[SPEAKER_03]: I seriously want to do that.

2106
02:42:13,548 --> 02:42:14,949
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not doing anything on Halloween, right?

2107
02:42:15,909 --> 02:42:16,850
[SPEAKER_07]: Is your thing on Halloween?

2108
02:42:16,950 --> 02:42:18,010
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's on like the 2nd.

2109
02:42:18,130 --> 02:42:18,470
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

2110
02:42:18,550 --> 02:42:19,591
[SPEAKER_03]: Showgirls party at my house.

2111
02:42:19,731 --> 02:42:20,331
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck yes.

2112
02:42:21,352 --> 02:42:23,473
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll just push everything out of the room.

2113
02:42:23,633 --> 02:42:26,674
[SPEAKER_07]: Can I bring over a kiddie pool and we'll reenact the pool scene with the cats?

2114
02:42:26,794 --> 02:42:27,094
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes!

2115
02:42:28,415 --> 02:42:28,775
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

2116
02:42:28,855 --> 02:42:30,036
[SPEAKER_03]: Midna might bite me.

2117
02:42:30,296 --> 02:42:30,916
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

2118
02:42:34,454 --> 02:42:38,177
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but seriously, I'm totally down for showgirls at my house on Halloween.

2119
02:42:38,217 --> 02:42:40,138
[SPEAKER_03]: You really shouldn't throttle cats like that.

2120
02:42:40,518 --> 02:42:41,518
[SPEAKER_03]: With mimosas.

2121
02:42:42,279 --> 02:42:43,920
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob.

2122
02:42:43,940 --> 02:42:47,502
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I have to drive home, but... I have a couch.

2123
02:42:47,562 --> 02:42:48,963
[SPEAKER_07]: I gotta work on Friday, girl.

2124
02:42:49,123 --> 02:42:49,303
Girl.

2125
02:42:49,679 --> 02:42:49,839
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

2126
02:42:50,260 --> 02:42:54,645
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, we have Mimosas early and then you can, you know, work it off doing the hand wave.

2127
02:42:54,685 --> 02:42:55,146
[SPEAKER_07]: Two things.

2128
02:42:55,506 --> 02:42:57,989
[SPEAKER_08]: Two random thoughts I just had here.

2129
02:42:58,550 --> 02:43:03,916
[SPEAKER_08]: One, I would totally back any sort of Kickstarter related game that has to do with Showgirls.

2130
02:43:04,196 --> 02:43:09,903
[SPEAKER_08]: Perhaps like, you know, a WarioWare type situation where you have all these different mini games that have to do with Showgirls.

2131
02:43:10,423 --> 02:43:16,048
[SPEAKER_08]: And two, I just thought, remember they have that really retarded JibJab site or whatever where you can put your face on stuff?

2132
02:43:16,188 --> 02:43:20,732
[SPEAKER_08]: They really need to put scenes from Sure Girls in there where you can just put your face on those characters because that'd be hilarious.

2133
02:43:20,772 --> 02:43:22,033
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god, you know what I just remembered?

2134
02:43:22,233 --> 02:43:24,174
[SPEAKER_07]: It would be Leo-tarded, Loki.

2135
02:43:24,675 --> 02:43:30,219
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I just remembered, you know all I know about JibJab is that This Land thing that they made with Romney and Bush.

2136
02:43:30,299 --> 02:43:33,642
[SPEAKER_07]: I see those god-awful Christmas card singing elves things on Facebook.

2137
02:43:33,662 --> 02:43:34,803
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't look at that shit.

2138
02:43:35,023 --> 02:43:39,948
[SPEAKER_08]: The management at my work think those are so clever every fucking year.

2139
02:43:39,988 --> 02:43:44,392
[SPEAKER_03]: All I know of JibJab is the year that they did This Land featuring, not Romney, what am I saying?

2140
02:43:45,012 --> 02:43:47,535
[SPEAKER_03]: Who was the guy that ran against Bush that we all knew would lose?

2141
02:43:48,255 --> 02:43:48,876
[SPEAKER_07]: Gore?

2142
02:43:49,376 --> 02:43:49,857
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

2143
02:43:50,357 --> 02:43:50,818
[SPEAKER_07]: John Kerry.

2144
02:43:50,978 --> 02:43:51,478
[SPEAKER_03]: John Kerry.

2145
02:43:51,778 --> 02:43:52,759
[SPEAKER_03]: The guy who looked like an ent.

2146
02:43:53,900 --> 02:43:54,101
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

2147
02:43:54,421 --> 02:43:54,601
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

2148
02:43:55,702 --> 02:43:56,623
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that was pretty funny.

2149
02:43:57,506 --> 02:43:57,746
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2150
02:43:58,487 --> 02:43:58,867
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.

2151
02:43:59,107 --> 02:44:01,048
[SPEAKER_07]: Going to chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

2152
02:44:01,568 --> 02:44:03,770
[SPEAKER_07]: Tim Tripp suggests a Kinect-based Showgirls dance game.

2153
02:44:04,810 --> 02:44:07,392
[SPEAKER_07]: Darte Suya said, do they do shadow casts of Showgirls?

2154
02:44:07,432 --> 02:44:07,952
[SPEAKER_07]: Just wondering.

2155
02:44:08,312 --> 02:44:08,432
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

2156
02:44:08,672 --> 02:44:14,395
[SPEAKER_07]: And by the way, this is like the third time this year Showgirls has come up on the show, which has nothing to do with video games.

2157
02:44:14,796 --> 02:44:17,617
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess that's what makes our show unique, if you can tolerate this chat.

2158
02:44:17,897 --> 02:44:25,762
[SPEAKER_07]: But I will entertain this question because the one thing I look forward to every year in August is at the Castro Theater in San Francisco, California.

2159
02:44:25,782 --> 02:44:25,842
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

2160
02:44:26,562 --> 02:44:39,424
[SPEAKER_07]: the drag queen Peaches Christ and her yes that's her name Peaches Christ and her crew put on a midnight showing or no I guess it's more it's the Peaches Christ midnight mass I guess they bumped it up a little bit because we're all getting older it's more like this 8 p.m.

2161
02:44:39,464 --> 02:44:52,567
[SPEAKER_07]: showing of showgirls and the bitch comes out of a volcano and they all do the dance to goddess and the whole thing and then they do free lap dances with a large popcorn and for like the past four or five years Alan and I have been going religiously to this thing

2162
02:44:52,987 --> 02:44:54,068
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to go with you guys next year.

2163
02:44:54,448 --> 02:44:55,169
[SPEAKER_07]: You came one time.

2164
02:44:55,229 --> 02:44:57,370
[SPEAKER_03]: I came once, but I didn't get to go this last year.

2165
02:44:57,390 --> 02:44:57,971
[SPEAKER_03]: I went the year before.

2166
02:44:58,711 --> 02:45:00,112
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we went to Sausage Factory.

2167
02:45:01,673 --> 02:45:03,294
[SPEAKER_07]: Which is a restaurant in the Castro.

2168
02:45:03,875 --> 02:45:08,618
[SPEAKER_07]: But yes, I pretty much live for that day of the year because I love showgirls.

2169
02:45:08,718 --> 02:45:10,920
[SPEAKER_07]: And by the way, Elizabeth Berkley on Dancing with the Stars.

2170
02:45:11,480 --> 02:45:12,260
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been watching.

2171
02:45:12,280 --> 02:45:13,221
[SPEAKER_02]: Gives me life.

2172
02:45:13,501 --> 02:45:15,381
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you see the I'm So Excited dance?

2173
02:45:15,401 --> 02:45:15,921
[SPEAKER_02]: Who didn't?

2174
02:45:16,422 --> 02:45:16,982
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, right?

2175
02:45:17,022 --> 02:45:18,642
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even watch that show when I watch that.

2176
02:45:18,722 --> 02:45:19,643
[SPEAKER_07]: Even Loki.

2177
02:45:19,663 --> 02:45:21,203
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I was like, even Loki saw it.

2178
02:45:21,323 --> 02:45:21,903
[SPEAKER_07]: You didn't see it?

2179
02:45:21,923 --> 02:45:21,963
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

2180
02:45:22,223 --> 02:45:22,724
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, she did.

2181
02:45:23,284 --> 02:45:24,624
[SPEAKER_07]: You remember Saved by the Bell, right?

2182
02:45:24,724 --> 02:45:25,224
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I remember.

2183
02:45:25,284 --> 02:45:27,125
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't even watch Saved by the Bell and I know that scene.

2184
02:45:27,145 --> 02:45:29,566
[SPEAKER_07]: She did a dance related to that and they actually like.

2185
02:45:29,586 --> 02:45:30,386
[SPEAKER_03]: They even had scenery.

2186
02:45:30,506 --> 02:45:32,467
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, she was taking, she was ODing on jive pills.

2187
02:45:33,227 --> 02:45:33,867
[SPEAKER_07]: It was great.

2188
02:45:34,378 --> 02:45:36,219
[SPEAKER_03]: And the answer was, of course, The Jive.

2189
02:45:36,360 --> 02:45:43,665
[SPEAKER_03]: Although, I will say this, the best person to ever do The Jive on that show was Stacey Keebler.

2190
02:45:44,206 --> 02:45:44,586
[SPEAKER_03]: Just saying.

2191
02:45:46,708 --> 02:45:48,069
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll have to look it up, I guess.

2192
02:45:49,249 --> 02:45:51,011
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, is that it for Mailbag?

2193
02:45:51,631 --> 02:45:52,232
[SPEAKER_07]: It is for now.

2194
02:45:52,552 --> 02:45:53,953
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, then there you go.

2195
02:45:54,093 --> 02:45:56,795
[SPEAKER_07]: Now we get to the part of the show with the FUs of the week.

2196
02:45:56,995 --> 02:45:58,697
[SPEAKER_07]: We get a little angst out of our system.

2197
02:45:58,777 --> 02:45:59,157
[SPEAKER_07]: Why?

2198
02:45:59,597 --> 02:46:00,178
[SPEAKER_07]: Because...

2199
02:46:16,961 --> 02:46:18,652
[SPEAKER_03]: F you to my state of unemployment.

2200
02:46:19,175 --> 02:46:19,558
[SPEAKER_03]: Again.

2201
02:46:21,540 --> 02:46:24,142
[SPEAKER_03]: I really want this job that I interviewed for.

2202
02:46:24,542 --> 02:46:26,984
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems like such a great match.

2203
02:46:28,605 --> 02:46:34,370
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate getting my hopes up too, so F you to getting my hopes up because the last few times I've been pretty dashed.

2204
02:46:35,091 --> 02:46:37,633
[SPEAKER_03]: But I feel really positively.

2205
02:46:37,673 --> 02:46:41,376
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't heard anything back yet, so F you to the anticipation.

2206
02:46:41,516 --> 02:46:42,396
[SPEAKER_03]: F you to the waiting room.

2207
02:46:43,137 --> 02:46:47,561
[SPEAKER_03]: And I really, really want this to be successful.

2208
02:46:47,661 --> 02:46:48,641
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd really like this job.

2209
02:46:49,482 --> 02:46:50,103
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be perfect.

2210
02:46:51,383 --> 02:46:53,765
[SPEAKER_03]: So, F you to oil paint as well.

2211
02:47:18,550 --> 02:47:20,170
[SPEAKER_06]: and Rob just came up with an FU.

2212
02:47:20,370 --> 02:47:30,273
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'm going next because I well, FU to the headache that I just went to the bathroom to get Advil for my headache and then FU to the fact that I stubbed my toe on the way back.

2213
02:47:30,413 --> 02:47:31,233
[SPEAKER_07]: It fucking hurts.

2214
02:47:31,273 --> 02:47:32,053
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you want ice?

2215
02:47:32,533 --> 02:47:33,113
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

2216
02:47:33,633 --> 02:47:34,373
[SPEAKER_07]: Kiss it, make it better.

2217
02:47:34,713 --> 02:47:34,854
[SPEAKER_03]: Eh.

2218
02:47:36,314 --> 02:47:37,474
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, what's your FU?

2219
02:47:37,494 --> 02:47:38,534
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll get a kitty to kiss it.

2220
02:47:38,614 --> 02:47:39,815
[SPEAKER_03]: Kitty kisses make it all better.

2221
02:47:39,935 --> 02:47:41,575
[SPEAKER_07]: She's hiding under the bed because she hates people.

2222
02:47:42,186 --> 02:47:49,290
[SPEAKER_08]: My FU goes to the city of Folsom and their wonderful event that they had on Friday, their Night of a Thousand Pumpkins.

2223
02:47:49,770 --> 02:47:57,775
[SPEAKER_08]: See, I don't go down to Old Folsom because it's like this hipster, historic area that they do events in, stuff like that.

2224
02:47:57,795 --> 02:48:00,036
[SPEAKER_08]: What a bunch of douchebags.

2225
02:48:00,717 --> 02:48:06,500
[SPEAKER_08]: But seriously though, they had their thing and see, I don't do that, but free trick-or-treating and stuff like that.

2226
02:48:06,940 --> 02:48:08,221
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2227
02:48:29,679 --> 02:48:30,260
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching!

2228
02:48:53,567 --> 02:48:56,708
[SPEAKER_06]: F you to myself for not being able to just get on a freaking plane.

2229
02:48:57,128 --> 02:49:03,091
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not hard to get around places and save a hell of a lot of time and grief.

2230
02:49:03,851 --> 02:49:09,813
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't mind driving, but some days, whatever.

2231
02:49:10,093 --> 02:49:10,954
[SPEAKER_06]: And there was a second one.

2232
02:49:12,995 --> 02:49:14,015
[SPEAKER_06]: F you to money in general.

2233
02:49:15,313 --> 02:49:15,953
[SPEAKER_02]: I hear that.

2234
02:49:16,454 --> 02:49:16,914
[SPEAKER_07]: I hear that.

2235
02:49:17,855 --> 02:49:18,235
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2236
02:49:18,275 --> 02:49:18,615
[SPEAKER_07]: There it is.

2237
02:49:18,675 --> 02:49:19,696
[SPEAKER_07]: The FUs of the week.

2238
02:49:19,796 --> 02:49:20,496
[SPEAKER_07]: So angsty.

2239
02:49:20,837 --> 02:49:21,337
[SPEAKER_07]: So fresh.

2240
02:49:21,537 --> 02:49:21,857
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2241
02:49:22,458 --> 02:49:23,679
[SPEAKER_07]: Just a few more stories for you guys.

2242
02:49:23,779 --> 02:49:26,040
[SPEAKER_02]: An FU to misspell Halloween.

2243
02:49:28,021 --> 02:49:28,882
[SPEAKER_07]: Poor Ragenator.

2244
02:49:28,922 --> 02:49:30,363
[SPEAKER_07]: But then again, we've been picking on that guy forever.

2245
02:49:30,383 --> 02:49:31,223
[SPEAKER_03]: We still love you, Ragenator.

2246
02:49:31,243 --> 02:49:31,664
[SPEAKER_03]: He's used to it.

2247
02:49:31,844 --> 02:49:35,426
[SPEAKER_03]: Bones did it too, but I'm just being, I just use it as a lunch.

2248
02:49:35,586 --> 02:49:36,727
[SPEAKER_07]: Blame autocorrect.

2249
02:49:36,827 --> 02:49:37,568
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what people do.

2250
02:49:37,748 --> 02:49:37,988
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2251
02:49:38,849 --> 02:49:40,949
[SPEAKER_02]: How is that even an autocorrect thing?

2252
02:49:40,989 --> 02:49:42,210
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's misspelled.

2253
02:49:42,770 --> 02:49:44,130
[SPEAKER_02]: Shouldn't autocorrect catch that?

2254
02:49:44,150 --> 02:49:44,730
[SPEAKER_02]: Calm down, Lee.

2255
02:49:44,770 --> 02:49:49,091
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be hilarious to change someone's autocorrect to wrong stuff.

2256
02:49:49,751 --> 02:49:50,371
[SPEAKER_07]: It learns.

2257
02:49:50,871 --> 02:49:56,892
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, my phone knows when I start to type L-U-V, it goes, love you mean it.

2258
02:49:57,132 --> 02:49:58,533
[SPEAKER_07]: It knows that that's a word.

2259
02:49:58,873 --> 02:50:01,073
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to know how my iPad gets all these things wrong.

2260
02:50:01,153 --> 02:50:03,154
[SPEAKER_07]: It knows fuckery as a word now.

2261
02:50:03,174 --> 02:50:04,654
[SPEAKER_03]: My phone knows asshattery.

2262
02:50:06,377 --> 02:50:09,202
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, I have to go with Queen Simia down with capitalism.

2263
02:50:10,704 --> 02:50:16,174
[SPEAKER_06]: I will say my phone always picks either we're or were wrong and it's actually kind of really annoying.

2264
02:50:17,095 --> 02:50:19,940
[SPEAKER_03]: I do have OMW turned automatically into on my way.

2265
02:50:20,535 --> 02:50:21,456
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody does by default.

2266
02:50:21,716 --> 02:50:27,199
[SPEAKER_07]: Jason, some flight advice from Shane Alinko in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

2267
02:50:27,539 --> 02:50:30,780
[SPEAKER_07]: Jason, if you're afraid to fly, ask for vodka on the plane.

2268
02:50:31,161 --> 02:50:35,783
[SPEAKER_07]: I told a flight attendant I was scared and she gave me vodka and orange juice and it made the flight super fun.

2269
02:50:38,499 --> 02:50:38,959
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

2270
02:50:55,493 --> 02:50:58,014
[SPEAKER_07]: and you don't live that far from Denver, right?

2271
02:50:58,094 --> 02:50:58,294
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

2272
02:50:58,354 --> 02:51:02,195
[SPEAKER_07]: That's where Frontiers Hub is and they're one of those companies that I would imagine would have something like that.

2273
02:51:02,855 --> 02:51:03,195
[SPEAKER_07]: Check it out.

2274
02:51:03,335 --> 02:51:04,956
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what the best flight I've ever had was?

2275
02:51:04,976 --> 02:51:08,277
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a Southwest flight where it was me and Julie.

2276
02:51:09,577 --> 02:51:18,060
[SPEAKER_03]: We were going to Las Vegas and we got on there and they totally didn't give a fuck when they were doing the flight safety.

2277
02:51:18,160 --> 02:51:18,960
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds like Southwest.

2278
02:51:20,700 --> 02:51:22,981
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you have any questions, please hesitate to answer.

2279
02:51:23,361 --> 02:51:26,882
[SPEAKER_03]: If you find the plane going down, you better hold on to your ass because we're going to die.

2280
02:51:29,323 --> 02:51:38,106
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see people like, and then everyone else is laughing so hard that the people that got scared were embarrassed into laughing with them.

2281
02:51:38,846 --> 02:51:40,787
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the guy says, just kidding.

2282
02:51:40,807 --> 02:51:41,107
[SPEAKER_03]: That's like 98%.

2283
02:51:43,868 --> 02:51:44,728
[SPEAKER_03]: What's our statistics?

2284
02:51:46,208 --> 02:51:46,749
[SPEAKER_03]: It was great.

2285
02:51:46,769 --> 02:51:47,889
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the best flight I've ever been on.

2286
02:51:50,239 --> 02:51:51,599
[SPEAKER_07]: You just need liquor and pills, Jason.

2287
02:51:51,619 --> 02:51:52,259
[SPEAKER_07]: It makes it easier.

2288
02:51:52,740 --> 02:51:53,040
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2289
02:51:54,300 --> 02:51:54,940
[SPEAKER_07]: Moving on.

2290
02:51:54,980 --> 02:51:55,620
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what, though?

2291
02:51:56,860 --> 02:52:00,461
[SPEAKER_07]: Some people don't have the patience to do the drive or the train or anything like that.

2292
02:52:00,541 --> 02:52:05,022
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, at least you get to see such beautiful parts of the country as Elko, Nevada.

2293
02:52:06,422 --> 02:52:08,763
[SPEAKER_06]: And all of southern Wyoming across I-80.

2294
02:52:08,923 --> 02:52:10,223
[SPEAKER_07]: And the no-tell motels.

2295
02:52:10,963 --> 02:52:17,825
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the whole thing about flight is, you know, trying to say, is going to the bathroom on the plane worthwhile?

2296
02:52:17,845 --> 02:52:17,925
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

2297
02:52:18,525 --> 02:52:21,526
[SPEAKER_03]: Do I need to get out of my window seat to go pee or can I hold it?

2298
02:52:23,587 --> 02:52:24,927
[SPEAKER_07]: Always go to the bathroom on the plane.

2299
02:52:24,947 --> 02:52:26,948
[SPEAKER_07]: You're never going to see those people again in your entire life.

2300
02:52:27,208 --> 02:52:30,329
[SPEAKER_03]: And, Gamit, there's a way for a plane to have fireball on it.

2301
02:52:30,649 --> 02:52:35,391
[SPEAKER_03]: You get the little... You mean the liquor, not the... The liquor.

2302
02:52:35,731 --> 02:52:36,651
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, thank you.

2303
02:52:36,691 --> 02:52:41,133
[SPEAKER_03]: They do have these little flasks that are disguised as tampons.

2304
02:52:43,655 --> 02:52:52,382
[SPEAKER_06]: I kid you not, they're actually for yachts Speaking of things you do because you'll never see the other people on the plane ever again This is a video game show, right?

2305
02:52:52,422 --> 02:53:02,431
[SPEAKER_03]: We will talk about that at some point Yeah, we're just talking about hijacking We just said this was a slow news week Fuck it, we're filling space True, true This is our new version of the fuck it show

2306
02:53:03,140 --> 02:53:05,582
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, we gotta get to phone calls too.

2307
02:53:06,303 --> 02:53:09,006
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki's got one more story for us, then we're gonna get to the phone calls.

2308
02:53:09,026 --> 02:53:12,469
[SPEAKER_07]: 1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2309
02:53:13,229 --> 02:53:13,950
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, what do you have for us?

2310
02:53:14,250 --> 02:53:15,952
[SPEAKER_08]: So I guess Second Life is happening soon.

2311
02:53:16,673 --> 02:53:17,353
[SPEAKER_08]: November 2nd.

2312
02:53:17,994 --> 02:53:18,775
[SPEAKER_08]: You mean Extra Life?

2313
02:53:19,255 --> 02:53:20,156
[SPEAKER_08]: Extra Life, whatever.

2314
02:53:21,860 --> 02:53:22,300
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, okay.

2315
02:53:23,881 --> 02:53:24,721
[SPEAKER_08]: So yes, Extra Life.

2316
02:53:26,242 --> 02:53:28,142
[SPEAKER_08]: And November 2nd.

2317
02:53:29,022 --> 02:53:33,404
[SPEAKER_08]: So donate, sponsor people, do all that fun stuff.

2318
02:53:34,784 --> 02:53:35,645
[SPEAKER_07]: Ah, it's this weekend.

2319
02:53:36,565 --> 02:53:38,186
[SPEAKER_07]: For the Children's Miracle Network.

2320
02:53:40,266 --> 02:53:59,113
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's great that this charity kind of has really embraced this whole thing and kind of really made it one of their highlight fundraisers of the year I don't know if you've seen this but on PlayStation 3 they actually have an ad for Extra Life right now and if you raise certain amounts of money you get like PlayStation rewards with that so I thought that was really cool that it all kind of like integrates together so awesome

2321
02:54:00,453 --> 02:54:00,753
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2322
02:54:01,073 --> 02:54:02,994
[SPEAKER_07]: Good luck to those of you doing Extra Life, by the way.

2323
02:54:03,474 --> 02:54:08,255
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd love to do it, but my wife wouldn't let me have 25 hours of pure gaming.

2324
02:54:09,155 --> 02:54:11,216
[SPEAKER_07]: We need to do something charity-related.

2325
02:54:12,436 --> 02:54:15,277
[SPEAKER_03]: I have things to tell you offline.

2326
02:54:15,477 --> 02:54:21,878
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to suggest we'll probably do the MS Walk again with Horde House next year, and I'd really like OLR to get involved with that, too.

2327
02:54:21,918 --> 02:54:23,699
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe we can raise a ton of money for a great cause.

2328
02:54:24,039 --> 02:54:25,059
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll look at that.

2329
02:54:25,379 --> 02:54:27,120
[SPEAKER_07]: But for now, extra life.

2330
02:54:27,160 --> 02:54:28,201
[SPEAKER_07]: Good luck to those of you doing it.

2331
02:54:28,401 --> 02:54:31,023
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll have to watch some of those streams myself.

2332
02:54:31,983 --> 02:54:35,526
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, we're going to go right into phone calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

2333
02:54:35,746 --> 02:54:41,430
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to skip what I had on the show roll because it was a Twitter news story and it ain't even worth it.

2334
02:54:41,450 --> 02:54:46,293
[SPEAKER_07]: The more I think about it, my eyes roll so far back in the back of my head I can see my brain.

2335
02:54:46,693 --> 02:54:50,376
[SPEAKER_07]: If you are dying to know what I was going to report on, that whole Sessler Gate thing.

2336
02:54:50,496 --> 02:54:51,276
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all I'm going to say.

2337
02:54:52,037 --> 02:54:53,658
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't even know what you're talking about.

2338
02:54:53,678 --> 02:54:54,759
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no idea what that is.

2339
02:54:55,779 --> 02:54:56,500
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, here I go.

2340
02:54:56,600 --> 02:54:57,920
[SPEAKER_07]: No, that's perfect.

2341
02:54:57,940 --> 02:54:58,761
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's talk about it.

2342
02:54:58,801 --> 02:54:59,421
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's talk about it.

2343
02:54:59,441 --> 02:54:59,761
[SPEAKER_07]: Come on.

2344
02:55:00,102 --> 02:55:00,622
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

2345
02:55:00,642 --> 02:55:02,123
[SPEAKER_07]: And we'll talk about how ridiculous it is.

2346
02:55:02,343 --> 02:55:03,203
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, quickly.

2347
02:55:03,663 --> 02:55:10,967
[SPEAKER_07]: He's whining on Twitter because supposedly there is some thing about the new console that's going to make it hard to do his job.

2348
02:55:11,027 --> 02:55:13,528
[SPEAKER_07]: Like some big thing that isn't announced yet.

2349
02:55:14,149 --> 02:55:16,370
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's not Xbox One, it's PlayStation 4.

2350
02:55:16,750 --> 02:55:17,551
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all been deduced.

2351
02:55:17,811 --> 02:55:20,432
[SPEAKER_07]: This is Reddit, Twitter, all these, you know, folks...

2352
02:55:22,373 --> 02:55:25,516
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if that would be it necessarily because I think when Nintendo announced that nobody got warning about that.

2353
02:55:25,536 --> 02:55:26,196
[SPEAKER_07]: That just happened.

2354
02:55:50,795 --> 02:55:53,957
[SPEAKER_07]: and that isn't supposed to impact review videos in fair use.

2355
02:55:54,998 --> 02:56:04,705
[SPEAKER_07]: My thought is, genuinely, is that it's the PlayStation 4 preview review events because it doesn't sound like they're sending out copies of PlayStation 4 games to people.

2356
02:56:04,765 --> 02:56:05,746
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to come in and play them.

2357
02:56:06,446 --> 02:56:09,428
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's what they do for audio CDs and a lot of those critics have to do.

2358
02:56:09,609 --> 02:56:09,909
[SPEAKER_07]: Why?

2359
02:56:10,269 --> 02:56:10,769
[SPEAKER_07]: Piracy.

2360
02:56:12,170 --> 02:56:13,471
[SPEAKER_07]: So... Because people ruined it.

2361
02:56:13,851 --> 02:56:18,332
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you have to go somewhere else to play the game, you can't get video in advance.

2362
02:56:18,712 --> 02:56:21,913
[SPEAKER_07]: That might ruin your day if you are somebody who does a lot of YouTube video reviews.

2363
02:56:22,513 --> 02:56:24,274
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I don't know.

2364
02:56:25,734 --> 02:56:31,416
[SPEAKER_07]: It's hard for me to feel sorry, but it certainly is an interesting challenge about the new generation.

2365
02:56:31,916 --> 02:56:32,076
[SPEAKER_07]: But...

2366
02:56:33,737 --> 02:56:34,057
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever.

2367
02:56:34,237 --> 02:56:34,777
[SPEAKER_07]: So there you go.

2368
02:56:34,877 --> 02:56:36,018
[SPEAKER_07]: In a nutshell, there's your story.

2369
02:56:36,218 --> 02:56:37,178
[SPEAKER_07]: Now we can go to the calls.

2370
02:56:37,718 --> 02:56:38,058
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

2371
02:56:38,078 --> 02:56:41,019
[SPEAKER_07]: 1-877-GAME-OLR I saw a Doctor Who icon.

2372
02:56:41,039 --> 02:56:41,599
[SPEAKER_03]: You better answer it.

2373
02:56:41,619 --> 02:56:42,359
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, I will.

2374
02:56:42,479 --> 02:56:46,260
[SPEAKER_07]: Please call 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2375
02:56:46,620 --> 02:56:48,321
[SPEAKER_07]: You can call in now and I will take the call.

2376
02:56:50,541 --> 02:56:52,082
[SPEAKER_07]: In the meantime, do we have last minute stories?

2377
02:56:52,122 --> 02:56:52,782
[SPEAKER_07]: Probably not tonight.

2378
02:56:54,142 --> 02:56:54,502
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

2379
02:56:54,522 --> 02:56:55,803
[SPEAKER_06]: We had hardly any stories tonight.

2380
02:56:55,883 --> 02:56:57,223
[SPEAKER_06]: I think you just took the last minute story.

2381
02:56:57,728 --> 02:56:58,468
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, there you go.

2382
02:56:59,369 --> 02:57:02,690
[SPEAKER_07]: I did see a couple tweets, and they were things worth mentioning, so I want to get to that.

2383
02:57:03,350 --> 02:57:08,051
[SPEAKER_07]: But again, if you want to call, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or use the name on Skype, Orange Launch Radio.

2384
02:57:08,131 --> 02:57:08,972
[SPEAKER_07]: I want Bobby to call.

2385
02:57:10,132 --> 02:57:11,512
[SPEAKER_06]: But you excluded him in chat.

2386
02:57:11,632 --> 02:57:12,633
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't exclude him.

2387
02:57:12,693 --> 02:57:13,453
[SPEAKER_03]: I said other people.

2388
02:57:13,473 --> 02:57:15,193
[SPEAKER_03]: I just said we also want some new people, too.

2389
02:57:15,594 --> 02:57:15,914
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2390
02:57:16,494 --> 02:57:19,695
[SPEAKER_07]: I encourage... Let's get to the phones and see who's there.

2391
02:57:19,935 --> 02:57:20,895
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2392
02:57:20,915 --> 02:57:21,255
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's this?

2393
02:57:22,456 --> 02:57:23,016
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, what's up, guys?

2394
02:57:23,036 --> 02:57:23,676
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Kaijudo.

2395
02:57:23,976 --> 02:57:24,816
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, Kaijudo.

2396
02:57:24,876 --> 02:57:25,217
[SPEAKER_07]: What's up?

2397
02:57:25,297 --> 02:57:25,717
[SPEAKER_07]: Long time no talk.

2398
02:57:25,737 --> 02:57:26,597
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, Dr. Who icon.

2399
02:57:28,857 --> 02:57:29,497
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, nothing much.

2400
02:57:29,537 --> 02:57:34,320
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to answer the question that one of your listeners proposed to you earlier today.

2401
02:57:36,401 --> 02:57:37,082
[SPEAKER_00]: How was it worded?

2402
02:57:37,122 --> 02:57:40,444
[SPEAKER_00]: Where you played a game and it was so disturbing that it made you stop?

2403
02:57:40,804 --> 02:57:43,906
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I had a scene that made you just completely not want to play the rest of it.

2404
02:57:44,066 --> 02:57:48,128
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, my game is Grand Theft Auto Vice City.

2405
02:57:48,228 --> 02:57:52,351
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a mission in that game where I think there's like a mob boss or something.

2406
02:57:52,951 --> 02:57:54,532
[SPEAKER_00]: And they want you to kill his wife.

2407
02:57:54,572 --> 02:57:55,853
[SPEAKER_00]: They want you to run her off the road.

2408
02:57:56,986 --> 02:58:09,702
[SPEAKER_00]: and I couldn't do that for the life of me like you you hear her like literally asking you like why are you doing this to me why are you trying to kill me it was so disturbing that I turned the game off never finished it never played it and that was back in 2002

2409
02:58:12,233 --> 02:58:17,955
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it's hard for me to sit here and go, wow, you're so crazy for that answer.

2410
02:58:17,975 --> 02:58:20,035
[SPEAKER_07]: That's pretty admirable.

2411
02:58:20,595 --> 02:58:22,736
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you just sound like a nice guy to me.

2412
02:58:22,976 --> 02:58:27,957
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, if it was the mob guy, I would have shot him in the face, no problem.

2413
02:58:28,117 --> 02:58:29,297
[SPEAKER_00]: Lock him in the trunk, do whatever.

2414
02:58:29,357 --> 02:58:30,858
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't know.

2415
02:58:30,898 --> 02:58:33,238
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just the fact that I felt she was an innocent.

2416
02:58:33,319 --> 02:58:34,679
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like when you play Grand Theft Auto.

2417
02:58:35,399 --> 02:58:41,123
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, anyone that you kill in that game, they're usually just criminals and they're either going to kill you before you kill them.

2418
02:58:41,644 --> 02:58:45,887
[SPEAKER_00]: So you kind of work that out in your mind that, okay, this is justifiable.

2419
02:58:45,987 --> 02:58:48,669
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't know, just killing that woman wasn't justifiable.

2420
02:58:48,709 --> 02:58:52,171
[SPEAKER_03]: I could research and see if she had a meth lab or a child smuggling ring.

2421
02:58:52,472 --> 02:58:56,815
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this was in the 80s, so there weren't any meth labs.

2422
02:58:56,975 --> 02:58:59,897
[SPEAKER_00]: If anything, she was a cocaine queen or whatever the fuck.

2423
02:59:00,177 --> 02:59:00,417
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah.

2424
02:59:29,638 --> 02:59:30,659
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't get that real.

2425
02:59:31,039 --> 02:59:31,699
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just funny.

2426
02:59:32,820 --> 02:59:34,641
[SPEAKER_07]: So my brain can easily differentiate.

2427
02:59:34,661 --> 02:59:39,664
[SPEAKER_07]: But I can see where if this poor innocent woman is screaming her head off, like, please don't kill her.

2428
02:59:39,904 --> 02:59:43,726
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's kind of like, maybe I don't want to do this.

2429
02:59:44,506 --> 02:59:45,527
[SPEAKER_00]: Makes sense.

2430
02:59:46,407 --> 02:59:47,268
[SPEAKER_00]: It was exactly that.

2431
02:59:47,288 --> 02:59:51,550
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the fact that she was screaming and literally talking to me and asking me why.

2432
02:59:51,630 --> 02:59:53,992
[SPEAKER_00]: And grant the photo, you don't talk.

2433
02:59:54,352 --> 02:59:56,193
[SPEAKER_00]: So I couldn't really explain to her.

2434
02:59:56,753 --> 02:59:57,054
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?

2435
02:59:57,474 --> 03:00:00,619
[SPEAKER_07]: Or you're trying to explain from the couch and it's not working.

2436
03:00:02,723 --> 03:00:04,505
[SPEAKER_07]: So, well, that is a great answer.

2437
03:00:04,726 --> 03:00:08,592
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm curious to know if Loki remembers that part because he's the big Grand Theft Auto guy.

2438
03:00:09,652 --> 03:00:11,835
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, no, I don't remember that.

2439
03:00:12,015 --> 03:00:14,598
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't remember if I ever finished.

2440
03:00:14,838 --> 03:00:17,301
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't ever remember finishing Vice City.

2441
03:00:17,381 --> 03:00:18,302
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if I ever did.

2442
03:00:20,044 --> 03:00:23,808
[SPEAKER_08]: Because you didn't really, really get crazy about Grand Theft Auto until just the last one, right?

2443
03:00:23,828 --> 03:00:26,631
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think I ever finished 3 or Vice City.

2444
03:00:27,773 --> 03:00:28,333
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe I did.

2445
03:00:28,393 --> 03:00:29,074
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't remember.

2446
03:00:29,114 --> 03:00:30,155
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a long time ago.

2447
03:00:32,118 --> 03:00:34,440
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki was rocking out to the music so hard he didn't even hear it.

2448
03:00:34,460 --> 03:00:35,301
[SPEAKER_07]: He didn't even hear the woman.

2449
03:00:35,321 --> 03:00:36,142
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like, ooh, cheat codes.

2450
03:00:36,182 --> 03:00:37,223
[SPEAKER_08]: Ooh, I'm gonna go blow stuff up.

2451
03:00:37,263 --> 03:00:38,485
[SPEAKER_08]: And that was pretty much it, you know?

2452
03:00:38,765 --> 03:00:39,486
[SPEAKER_00]: Same with San Andreas.

2453
03:00:39,526 --> 03:00:40,887
[SPEAKER_08]: I know I didn't finish San Andreas.

2454
03:00:41,888 --> 03:00:44,091
[SPEAKER_00]: And I always wanted to finish it because, I mean, I love Vice City.

2455
03:00:44,131 --> 03:00:44,852
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the 80s.

2456
03:00:44,912 --> 03:00:46,273
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it had, like, a nice vibe to it.

2457
03:00:46,313 --> 03:00:47,875
[SPEAKER_00]: But just that part, man.

2458
03:00:47,975 --> 03:00:48,576
[SPEAKER_00]: Couldn't get by it.

2459
03:00:48,916 --> 03:00:49,337
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um...

2460
03:00:50,267 --> 03:01:04,256

2461

[SPEAKER_07]: I think you did at the beginning I did He did have a Doctor Who icon And then the whole time during his phone call I was playing the old theme since he had the 80s icon Yeah, it was classic Who, not new Who Are you gonna go to that whole 3D screening of Doctor Who or whatever I heard about this?

2462
03:01:18,364 --> 03:01:19,185
[SPEAKER_03]: No, because I hate people

2463
03:01:19,825 --> 03:01:21,086
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that's a fair answer.

2464
03:01:22,086 --> 03:01:23,547
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate going to the movies.

2465
03:01:23,647 --> 03:01:25,408
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I don't like going to opening night anything.

2466
03:01:25,608 --> 03:01:26,188
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't either.

2467
03:01:26,308 --> 03:01:28,449
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless it's like something I'm super excited about.

2468
03:01:28,489 --> 03:01:30,230
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's like I have to see The Hunger Games.

2469
03:01:30,490 --> 03:01:31,451
[SPEAKER_07]: God, catching fire.

2470
03:01:31,471 --> 03:01:33,051
[SPEAKER_03]: I just don't like people that much.

2471
03:01:33,912 --> 03:01:34,452
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't blame you.

[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we like this person that's calling in right now.

03:01:38,494 --> 03:01:40,335
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm right here and I'm glad you like this person.

2475
03:01:40,655 --> 03:01:41,695
[SPEAKER_07]: I do like this person.

2476
03:01:41,736 --> 03:01:42,596
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, Rama, how you doing?

2477
03:01:43,533 --> 03:01:44,614
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm doing pretty good.

2478
03:01:44,634 --> 03:01:45,775
[SPEAKER_05]: A little tired, but I'm good.

2479
03:01:46,015 --> 03:01:47,776
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, was there a con this weekend?

2480
03:01:48,737 --> 03:01:57,023
[SPEAKER_05]: No, but I work, and now my commute, instead of being from Brooklyn to Midtown Manhattan, is from Brooklyn to Jersey, so three-hour commute every single day.

2481
03:01:57,223 --> 03:01:58,064
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my gosh.

2482
03:01:58,424 --> 03:02:07,111
[SPEAKER_07]: But I was going to say, as far as the anime cons go, too, Halloween is the one time of the year where you're supposed to dress up, so it's like, it's cosplayers' vacation.

2483
03:02:07,131 --> 03:02:07,211
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

2484
03:02:08,197 --> 03:02:10,619
[SPEAKER_05]: or as I like to call it, National Cosplayer Zen.

2485
03:02:11,680 --> 03:02:12,220
[SPEAKER_07]: Fair enough.

2486
03:02:12,601 --> 03:02:14,122
[SPEAKER_07]: You know I'm just teasing you.

2487
03:02:14,162 --> 03:02:15,183
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm all for it.

2488
03:02:15,363 --> 03:02:16,284
[SPEAKER_07]: What else is on your mind, buddy?

2489
03:02:17,164 --> 03:02:18,826
[SPEAKER_05]: Three things, and I'll make it quick.

2490
03:02:19,866 --> 03:02:22,869
[SPEAKER_05]: Number one, and this is a frugal question of the week.

2491
03:02:23,169 --> 03:02:24,250
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll make this part brief.

2492
03:02:24,530 --> 03:02:27,613
[SPEAKER_05]: I was playing Bioshock, going through the level.

2493
03:02:28,273 --> 03:02:32,256
[SPEAKER_05]: My old roommate was standing there with his D&D crew, and they watched me play the game.

2494
03:02:32,477 --> 03:02:36,580
[SPEAKER_05]: I come to this one section where there is a casket sitting on a shelf.

2495
03:02:37,040 --> 03:02:37,541
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, okay.

2496
03:02:38,499 --> 03:02:46,582
[SPEAKER_05]: I walk over to it, the casket explodes, there are creatures coming at me, I'm killing them, and I'm like, what the fuck is this?

2497
03:02:46,783 --> 03:02:48,343
[SPEAKER_05]: Holy shit, what the fuck?

2498
03:02:48,763 --> 03:02:54,466
[SPEAKER_05]: I kill them all, and I'm just staring at the screen, I pause it, and I drop the controller, and it's like, fuck this, I'm done.

2499
03:02:54,986 --> 03:02:56,967
[SPEAKER_05]: Well played, Bioshock, well played.

2500
03:02:57,047 --> 03:02:57,887
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, there you go.

2501
03:02:58,968 --> 03:03:02,249
[SPEAKER_07]: That is a scary game that nobody brought up earlier, so, good answer.

2502
03:03:02,869 --> 03:03:04,830
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but mind you, I was playing with the lights on.

2503
03:03:08,663 --> 03:03:09,503
[SPEAKER_05]: What else is on your mind, buddy?

2504
03:03:11,164 --> 03:03:11,384
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyone?

2505
03:03:11,404 --> 03:03:11,644
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyone?

2506
03:03:12,785 --> 03:03:14,106
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I was just saying, what else is on your mind, buddy?

2507
03:03:14,586 --> 03:03:15,186
[SPEAKER_05]: My bad, my bad.

2508
03:03:15,686 --> 03:03:24,771
[SPEAKER_05]: Second thing, this was passed to me by someone on my fan page, and they're spreading the words of their Extra Life campaign out of Ohio.

2509
03:03:29,119 --> 03:03:30,541
[SPEAKER_05]: Happy Family and Friends

2510
03:03:49,669 --> 03:03:56,131
[SPEAKER_05]: They have not mentioned, but they did say there's going to be a lot of video games, anime, Kevin Smith, crude humor.

2511
03:03:56,151 --> 03:03:57,131
[SPEAKER_05]: Did I mention Kevin Smith?

2512
03:03:57,931 --> 03:04:00,912
[SPEAKER_07]: Is Kevin Smith going to be there or are they just watching Chasing Amy?

2513
03:04:02,312 --> 03:04:03,933
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody watches Chasing Amy.

2514
03:04:03,973 --> 03:04:04,753
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought you knew this.

2515
03:04:04,793 --> 03:04:05,233
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck you.

2516
03:04:05,313 --> 03:04:06,213
[SPEAKER_07]: I love that movie.

2517
03:04:06,793 --> 03:04:07,153
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey!

2518
03:04:08,754 --> 03:04:11,034
[SPEAKER_07]: See, you're a traitor.

2519
03:04:11,774 --> 03:04:13,935
[SPEAKER_05]: I will let you slide on it because you didn't say Jersey Girl.

2520
03:04:15,077 --> 03:04:16,757
[SPEAKER_07]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

2521
03:04:34,612 --> 03:04:37,374
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I already told him this.

2522
03:04:37,534 --> 03:04:38,715
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, I'm going to let you guys know.

2523
03:04:39,015 --> 03:04:48,881
[SPEAKER_05]: As you know, I have this issue with Shamestop and how I refuse to give them my money for the way they treat some of their customers and their products and this and that.

2524
03:04:48,981 --> 03:04:49,761
[SPEAKER_05]: Or their employees.

2525
03:04:50,522 --> 03:04:51,122
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep, them too.

2526
03:04:52,883 --> 03:04:57,306
[SPEAKER_05]: Long story short, old roommate reimbursed me money for a game that he can't find.

2527
03:04:57,386 --> 03:04:59,547
[SPEAKER_05]: So I go buy a used copy.

2528
03:04:59,927 --> 03:05:01,789
[SPEAKER_05]: I go in, they have like this special

2529
03:05:02,813 --> 03:05:06,854
[SPEAKER_05]: So what made you decide that ethically you're going to decide, okay, I'll boycott GameStop most of the time?

2530
03:05:29,594 --> 03:05:36,961
[SPEAKER_05]: I figure I might as well get a good deal on a used game as long as I have the game, the manual, and the original box art.

2531
03:05:37,141 --> 03:05:39,524
[SPEAKER_05]: If not, I'll go to Amazon and spend an extra ten bucks.

2532
03:05:42,807 --> 03:05:47,111
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, eventually you just can't boycott fully forever.

2533
03:05:47,151 --> 03:05:48,673
[SPEAKER_05]: Eventually you get to that point where you know what?

2534
03:05:50,994 --> 03:05:51,455
[SPEAKER_05]: Might as well.

2535
03:05:51,475 --> 03:05:54,175
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just going to go in, get what I want, and leave.

2536
03:05:54,796 --> 03:06:01,558
[SPEAKER_05]: As long as they don't ask me for power rewards, as long as they don't ask me to reserve this or that, I just want the game, and I want to go.

2537
03:06:02,578 --> 03:06:06,819
[SPEAKER_07]: That's part of the reason I like Amazon, because like Jamie, I don't like people sometimes.

2538
03:06:06,879 --> 03:06:10,180
[SPEAKER_07]: And Amazon, you just click your thing, or any online site, really.

2539
03:06:10,220 --> 03:06:15,102
[SPEAKER_07]: I know I keep pimping that one, but you just go on, you order what you want, and then it magically shows up at your door.

2540
03:06:15,122 --> 03:06:15,622
[SPEAKER_07]: It's great.

2541
03:06:16,689 --> 03:06:17,870
[SPEAKER_05]: At least you don't have to deal with this.

2542
03:06:18,050 --> 03:06:24,833
[SPEAKER_05]: You go into the store to buy something, headphones are on, and they're talking to you like you can hear them.

2543
03:06:25,173 --> 03:06:25,413
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

2544
03:06:26,034 --> 03:06:35,558
[SPEAKER_05]: You can kind of hear them, but you know the transaction, what you're doing, so you just want them to just pull up the screen, you can punch in your rewards card, pay for your item, and leave.

2545
03:06:37,359 --> 03:06:40,640
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, well Ranma, I'm going to let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thank you as always for the call.

2546
03:06:41,121 --> 03:06:41,681
[SPEAKER_05]: Ain't no problem, broski.

2547
03:06:41,701 --> 03:06:43,362
[SPEAKER_07]: And everybody listen to Anime Jam Session.

2548
03:06:44,002 --> 03:06:44,983
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2549
03:07:04,622 --> 03:07:05,002
[SPEAKER_05]: Never.

2550
03:07:05,022 --> 03:07:07,904
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, Ranma, what the fuck is going on?

2551
03:07:07,964 --> 03:07:08,685
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, for the year.

2552
03:07:08,725 --> 03:07:09,465
[SPEAKER_07]: That makes sense.

2553
03:07:10,226 --> 03:07:12,548
[SPEAKER_05]: I think my funeral services might be at a con.

2554
03:07:12,568 --> 03:07:14,369
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how much of a con whore I am.

2555
03:07:14,929 --> 03:07:25,937
[SPEAKER_07]: Ranma, not that I want to talk about that day anytime soon, but if I happen to still be here when that happens, I will see to it that the fucking kids pay their respects to the great Black Luigi.

2556
03:07:27,058 --> 03:07:30,120
[SPEAKER_03]: Will we be putting up the death note with your name in it?

2557
03:07:31,742 --> 03:07:33,263
[SPEAKER_03]: This time, I will allow it.

2558
03:07:33,723 --> 03:07:34,004
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2559
03:07:34,604 --> 03:07:35,145
[SPEAKER_07]: Take care, buddy.

2560
03:07:35,425 --> 03:07:36,366
[SPEAKER_03]: For the record, one last thing.

2561
03:07:36,886 --> 03:07:41,330
[SPEAKER_03]: Every time I see someone refer to SNK, I don't think of the anime.

2562
03:07:41,430 --> 03:07:45,634
[SPEAKER_03]: I think of my and all the King of Fighters games.

2563
03:07:45,654 --> 03:07:47,815
[SPEAKER_07]: I always think of Capcom versus SNK, too, which is me.

2564
03:07:47,936 --> 03:07:50,718
[SPEAKER_05]: I keep thinking of Shingeki no Kyojin.

2565
03:07:50,978 --> 03:07:52,019
[SPEAKER_05]: I just start reading the manga.

2566
03:07:52,319 --> 03:07:52,920
[SPEAKER_05]: It's phenomenal.

2567
03:07:53,180 --> 03:07:54,101
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I don't think I'm gonna.

2568
03:08:19,877 --> 03:08:48,926
[SPEAKER_07]: SSJ100 Matt sent us a few tweets this one you sent us about Neon FM was in last week's show just a heads up but the other one is about the Conan O'Brien thing where he played the scary games I've seen the tweets about this I haven't watched this yet but I'll have to check this out I don't want to play it over the air because you know it's Conan's thing but check that out I'm sure it's hilarious because Conan is hilarious and I paid a lot of money to see him live after he got kicked off of NBC and it was worth every penny so good times

2569
03:08:49,686 --> 03:08:50,227
[SPEAKER_07]: So check that out.

2570
03:08:50,267 --> 03:08:53,208
[SPEAKER_07]: He plays Slender the Eight Pages and Amnesia, and I'm sure it's great.

2571
03:08:54,449 --> 03:08:55,850
[SPEAKER_07]: TigerClaw sends us a few tweets.

2572
03:08:56,751 --> 03:09:01,353
[SPEAKER_07]: Classic games are now preserved and accessible on Archive.org.

2573
03:09:01,774 --> 03:09:02,554
[SPEAKER_07]: How does this work?

2574
03:09:02,694 --> 03:09:04,956
[SPEAKER_07]: Because isn't emulation kind of a gray area?

2575
03:09:04,976 --> 03:09:05,856
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm trying to read about this.

2576
03:09:06,437 --> 03:09:14,882
[SPEAKER_07]: The Internet Archive has created the Historical Software Archive, which is significantly older software runnable in a browser, which includes many games.

2577
03:09:15,342 --> 03:09:16,503
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks to J.S.

2578
03:09:16,663 --> 03:09:36,318
[SPEAKER_07]: Mess, the multi-emulator super system available in Java Jason Scott from the Internet Archives site says We have the ability to watch video, listen to music, and read documents right in our browsers Not so with classic software until now Included in the collection are games such as Mystery House by Roberto Williams

2579
03:09:37,318 --> 03:09:39,259
[SPEAKER_07]: Karataka by Jordan Mechner.

2580
03:09:39,279 --> 03:09:39,959
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember that game.

2581
03:09:40,299 --> 03:09:43,960
[SPEAKER_07]: And Atari's infamous E.T., the extraterrestrial.

2582
03:09:44,380 --> 03:09:45,161
[SPEAKER_07]: I had no idea.

2583
03:09:45,661 --> 03:09:49,022
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, does the copyright lift on this after so many years?

2584
03:09:49,162 --> 03:09:51,002
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought it was like 75 years and then some.

2585
03:09:51,502 --> 03:09:54,543
[SPEAKER_07]: Because the Disney laws keep getting passed to keep Mickey Mouse out of public domain.

2586
03:09:54,563 --> 03:09:56,524
[SPEAKER_08]: They might not have renewed that one.

2587
03:09:57,257 --> 03:09:57,978
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess that's true.

2588
03:09:59,379 --> 03:09:59,699
[SPEAKER_07]: Who cares?

2589
03:10:00,120 --> 03:10:06,245
[SPEAKER_07]: Or maybe because emulation is such a gray area, because these games are so old, like maybe it's just not a big deal.

2590
03:10:06,385 --> 03:10:06,685
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

2591
03:10:07,906 --> 03:10:08,727
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's still pretty cool.

2592
03:10:09,307 --> 03:10:10,388
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll check that out after the show.

2593
03:10:11,129 --> 03:10:12,750
[SPEAKER_07]: One other quick tweet here from Tigerclaw.

2594
03:10:12,810 --> 03:10:15,812
[SPEAKER_07]: It's about the Mortal Kombat film director who

2595
03:10:16,693 --> 03:10:45,524
[SPEAKER_07]: Kevin Tancho-Rowan I'm totally mispronouncing that name, sorry He's the director of Mortal Kombat Legacy and he has walked away from it He talked about it on Twitter He did the Mortal Kombat Legacy web series and that was after Mortal Kombat Rebirth New Line Cinema actually asked him to direct a future film in the Mortal Kombat universe but he said, quote After three years of combat, I've decided to move on to other creative opportunities I wish everyone involved in the movie a big success Thanks

2596
03:10:46,104 --> 03:10:46,684
[SPEAKER_07]: I can see that.

2597
03:10:46,985 --> 03:10:48,906
[SPEAKER_07]: Three years is a long time to spend on one project.

2598
03:10:48,926 --> 03:10:51,548
[SPEAKER_07]: You might not want your life and your career defined by the one thing.

2599
03:10:51,928 --> 03:10:53,149
[SPEAKER_07]: So I can see that.

2600
03:10:53,929 --> 03:11:00,714
[SPEAKER_07]: Speaking of video games becoming movies, you know, BlizzCon is in two weeks, and there's going to be lots of Warcraft movie news that comes out of that, I'm sure.

2601
03:11:01,054 --> 03:11:02,455
[SPEAKER_07]: I think they cast their first person, too.

2602
03:11:02,475 --> 03:11:05,837
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I remember seeing a story on that, too, that their first official person is cast in that.

2603
03:11:07,919 --> 03:11:14,543
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I know TigerClaw tweeted that at some point, but I don't have it up on the screen right now, and it is live radio.

2604
03:11:17,305 --> 03:11:19,166
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's probably on the Horde House page.

2605
03:11:20,367 --> 03:11:21,668
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure it got posted there.

2606
03:11:21,769 --> 03:11:22,789
[SPEAKER_07]: Trying to find it right now.

2607
03:11:24,511 --> 03:11:25,471
[SPEAKER_07]: Ah, I can't bring it up.

2608
03:11:25,511 --> 03:11:26,512
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't remember the guy's name.

2609
03:11:26,532 --> 03:11:27,853
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe somebody will yell it out in chat.

2610
03:11:27,893 --> 03:11:32,317
[SPEAKER_07]: But it was from some Viking thing on TV.

2611
03:11:32,997 --> 03:11:34,258
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't recognize the name of the guy.

2661
03:15:22,997 --> 03:15:23,537
[SPEAKER_07]: Your final thought.

2662
03:15:23,803 --> 03:15:29,264

2663
03:15:30,345 --> 03:15:38,627
[SPEAKER_08]: I've actually been using that screen quite a bit at work, because that's what I play on my PlayStation 3, so it's working out really good.

2664
03:15:40,307 --> 03:15:51,851
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm now trying to find an audio amp, which I'm going to go with an old USB speaker, and the battery, which I have one picked out already, and now a DC converter.

2665
03:15:51,991 --> 03:15:52,091
[SPEAKER_08]: So...

2666
03:15:53,411 --> 03:15:57,455
[SPEAKER_08]: and then I just need to design a case and vacuum form that bitch.

2667
03:15:58,637 --> 03:15:59,337
[SPEAKER_08]: Which will be hard.

2668
03:15:59,578 --> 03:15:59,978
[SPEAKER_08]: Good luck.

2669
03:15:59,998 --> 03:16:01,299
[SPEAKER_03]: The virtual boy looks so weird.

2670
03:16:02,040 --> 03:16:03,341
[SPEAKER_07]: I love my virtual boy hat.

2671
03:16:03,682 --> 03:16:04,002
[SPEAKER_07]: I love it.
