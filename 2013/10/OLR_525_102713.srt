Orange Lounge Radio

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
There's a host, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
This week, a fundraiser could lead to the release of an incomplete Sojam and Earl 3 for the Dreamcast.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Nintendo is re-imagining N64 titles for a release on the Wii U, and they may not be the only company reimagining their past titles.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
All this and more begins right now.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Orange Lounge Radio

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:44,000
It is Orange Lounge Radio episode number 525, October the 27th, 2013.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:51,000
My name is Rob Roberts, here with all you guys to talk about video games and gaming culture and so on and so forth with my co-hosts.

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
First up, the one and only DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I can't tell it pruning.

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
You can't be gardening, you're in the kitchen slash studio right now.

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Oh, Animal Crossing.

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
She's just like a witch.

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Wow, you actually have a little witches hat for your character.

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Because I paid money for Gracie items.

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Adorable.

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I have the full store now.

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Wow, you are like really hardcore into this Animal Crossing stuff, it's no joke.

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I have two characters that are mine, and I made one for Julian because I'm bribing him.

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
But I'll talk about that during my gaming week.

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm really surprised you haven't jumped on the Pokemon bandwagon yet.

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Although I understand, you know, you've got the finance issues going on right now and everything.

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
That is literally the reason.

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Oh, okay.

26
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I have no job.

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Which would make the Pokemon addiction worse should you somehow come across a copy.

28
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Except, you know, every time I've ever played a Pokemon game, I've gone about halfway through it and just completely lost interest.

29
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
It was like, I'm at the gym, let's play a Pokemon game.

30
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I will say the new one is like way, there's just more excitement and a better coat of paint or just something.

31
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
It really energizes that whole brand in a way I haven't felt in a very long time.

32
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Well, Hanukkah is coming up, so whatever.

33
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Ask Hanukkah Harry for one.

34
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
No.

35
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Alright.

36
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Actually, what I want for Hanukkah is a job.

37
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
And then I can buy my own damn Pokemans.

38
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Well, good luck.

39
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Yeah.

40
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Didn't you have an interview last week?

41
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I did, but I haven't heard back.

42
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Alright, fingers in, fingers in.

43
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Okay, do you think it's an encouraging sign when he just says, you have any more questions for me?

44
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
And I go, yeah, when do I start?

45
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
And he said, I like how you think.

46
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:26,000
And then telling me that the eight people, however many people before me, you know, I'm just, I don't want to go much too into the interview.

47
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Sure, sure, sure.

48
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Cross your fingers, cross your toes, light some candles, say a prayer, whatever.

49
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I'm trying not to be excited, but I need a prayer circle, Rob.

50
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Alright, let's join hands.

51
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Okay.

52
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Joining us in our prayer circle this evening, say hello to Techmaster Loki.

53
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Hi.

54
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
How you doing, Loki?

55
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Doing alright.

56
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Yeah?

57
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I wanted to get better food for dinner other than McDonald's, but I was too busy looking for UFO parts in Grand Theft Auto.

58
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I was like, wait a minute, is that like a toy for Josh?

59
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Oh, it's a Grand Theft Auto thing.

60
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Yeah.

61
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I will tell you this, Loki, I came so close to finally jumping on that Grand Theft Auto 5 bandwagon this week.

62
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
We were like, we were at Fry's or Best Buy or one of those stores, and I almost did it.

63
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
But then I was like, wait, Rob, you have an unopened copy of Grand Theft Auto 4 sitting on your shelf.

64
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
This is not okay.

65
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
You can't get on the 5 bandwagon until you at least play some 4.

66
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
No, you can get on the 5 bandwagon just fine.

67
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
And then Alan is like-

68
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Although, I mean, it will look that much better, but, you know, I still think you can get on the bandwagon without playing 4.

69
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
But Alan is like, Alan is like, why don't you just wait?

70
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
In like a year there'll be the Steam sale, it'll be 6 bucks on PC.

71
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I mean, granted, we don't really have a PC version confirmed, but we all know it'll probably happen at some point.

72
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
So, you know, he's encouraging me to wait, but I'm like, everybody's playing it now.

73
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
They're having the VoG night now.

74
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
It's fun. You're missing out.

75
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
But I need to save my money for the PlayStation 4 and all the games that aren't coming out.

76
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
May I interject one thing real quick?

77
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Of course.

78
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Happy birthday to Act Deft.

79
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Yes, happy birthday, or Feliz Cublianos, because he is one of our favorite Mexican listeners after all.

80
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I know we have a couple folks in Mexico that listen, so I don't want to play favorites too much,

81
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
but Act Deft has always been a loyal listener of the show and participator,

82
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
so I don't mind taking the time out at the top of the show to say happy birthday to Act Deft.

83
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It's not his birthday, but we always are happy to have him here in studio joining us with the show.

84
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Say hello, everybody. It's his un-birthday, so a merry un-birthday to VX JasonXV, or just Jason.

85
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
The other Mexican across the table, no less.

86
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
How you doing?

87
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Just not living in Mexico.

88
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Quienes.

89
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Doing good.

90
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I had something to say.

91
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Oh, you don't have to wait a whole other week to hear my voice again.

92
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Or three hours in this case, two and a half.

93
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Jason, if you didn't know, Jason is the new VO guy for basically VoG network.

94
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I mean, Bobby does some of the VOs, but you're slowly kind of taking over,

95
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
because since you don't have a show right now, you did have one for a while, right?

96
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Not on a network, not affiliated, but I was doing a podcast with some friends for a while.

97
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
That was before VoG and all that, right? You were doing that for you?

98
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Probably. It was quite a while ago at this point.

99
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
It was all a blur. It was all a blur.

100
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
But you do have a great voice, so you've been willing to do some voiceovers,

101
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
and I think people finally got sick of Rob with the echoes and all that stuff.

102
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Well, actually, you volunteered. You just said,

103
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Rob, I'm really sick of hearing that damn filter every week, and I'll do it if you need to know.

104
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
So I was like, sure, of course, and you've been doing a great job.

105
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I have my microphone set up, sitting nice and ready. I love my studio slash office set up,

106
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
and I thought, hey, Rob can always use an extra hour on Sunday, so this is probably a good idea.

107
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I like to think if the worst ever happened, and OLR and Horde House were both suddenly done,

108
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:43,000
which I don't even like to think about that, but all things come to an end eventually.

109
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Nothing's on the radar yet, folks. I don't want to scare anybody.

110
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
But I like to think if these projects were to ever come to an end,

111
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:55,000
that's kind of what I would want to do. I've been doing this radio amateur stuff so long,

112
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I would have to do something for someone, somewhere.

113
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
But I like to think I could just start up another show somewhere, but maybe, I don't know,

114
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,000
maybe in ten years I would not really want to do that anymore, and I'd just do VOs for somebody else.

115
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
And you have a ton of expertise that you can provide to someone else for the actual aspects of running a show.

116
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Oh, inflate my ego more.

117
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Producer engineering set up for streaming, recording.

118
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Keep talking, you're my friend.

119
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
There's many, many ways to put together a show, live podcast or otherwise.

120
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Everybody could be better, and somebody with expertise could provide that.

121
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Well, I couldn't do this every week, and I don't think Dark Soccer or Loki or even Jason could do this every week either,

122
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
if it weren't for the chatters.

123
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
So hello to our chat room, live.vognetwork.com, and hello to the podcast listeners as well.

124
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I don't want you guys to feel neglected.

125
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
We love everybody who participates with our show in one way or another.

126
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
But we do have the live chatters over at live.vognetwork.com.

127
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Tigerclaw says, I wish Rob did the intro with the auto-tune.

128
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I will say this.

129
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:02,000
We once were looking at doing a segment on the show that was extra for seeing the virtual console release dates.

130
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Back when the Wii was newer and there was a virtual console every week.

131
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Well, that was right when that app came out on iPhone that was like IMT Paint or whatever.

132
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:14,000
So we were actually looking at having him do that, but there wasn't any easy way for us to get that MP3 rip.

133
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Because we could rip it through the computer, but it didn't really save MP3, so it just didn't work out.

134
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
But I would have loved to do that segment with auto-tune.

135
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
So it's funny that you bring it to auto-tune.

136
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I can bring in my headset, because I was dumb enough to buy the headset, or I should say,

137
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
the collector's edition of Saints Row the Third that had the auto-tune headset.

138
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Wow.

139
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Which, spoiler alert, sucks ass.

140
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,000
But, you can if you sort of try to sing, I guess, over it.

141
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
It sort of sounds auto-tuned.

142
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I don't know.

143
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
You know what?

144
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
We both have Audition.

145
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,000
All I need to do is sit down for an hour and I can probably figure out how to do it.

146
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Well, yeah, no, no.

147
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Keep in mind, this was five years ago.

148
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
We have new toys now that we didn't have five years ago.

149
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
But we also don't have extra for as my roommate anymore.

150
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
So that idea is kind of long gone.

151
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
We have the internet.

152
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
We do. We do.

153
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
But there's no virtual console.

154
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I guess Wii U virtual console games, but it's not...

155
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I remember when the Wii was first out, we were seeing virtual console games all the time.

156
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
It was like three a week.

157
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
And on Wii U, they've been trickling through.

158
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I feel like every week we're getting something, but let's be real.

159
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
It hasn't been a very strong lineup the past week or so.

160
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I think one week we got tennis and baseball.

161
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
And those were like the Nintendo versions, like very basic versions of those games.

162
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
The launch time.

163
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Yeah, part of the launch lineup.

164
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I mean, they're basically named, for crying out loud.

165
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
That tells you when they came out.

166
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Yeah, exactly.

167
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
We could do the regular PlayStation Plus member awards.

168
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
We'll think of something.

169
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
We'll think of something.

170
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
This auto-tune thing is...

171
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
We're talking about this way too much.

172
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
All right.

173
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Let's do a kickoff topic before we get into our gaming weeks.

174
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
And we're going to break form a little bit here.

175
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
We usually do mailbag later in the show.

176
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
But what I'm going to ask Dark Sakura to do, could you open up the email bag for us,

177
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Dark Sakura?

178
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Because there was an email in there that I thought was really good and worth talking

179
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
about here at the top of the show.

180
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:18,000
So Dark Sakura, if you would dive into the email bag and pull out the email that I licked.

181
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
The email that you licked?

182
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Yes, it has the saliva all over it.

183
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
While I multitask opening my village for everybody who wanted me to do it.

184
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Animals can wait.

185
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Yeah, they can.

186
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I'm just being nice to people.

187
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Hey, OLR crew.

188
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
AZHP here.

189
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I wanted to get something off my chest that's been bugging me for a few weeks now.

190
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I had some friends over to play scary games a few weeks ago.

191
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
And a lot of them were giving advice on how to play Amnesia.

192
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Then I asked them if anyone wanted to play since they had played it before.

193
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
And they said, oh, I haven't played it before.

194
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I watched a playthrough on YouTube.

195
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
This got me kind of bummed out because I feel some of the magic of experiencing the game

196
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
together with friends was gone because they knew what was going to happen.

197
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
When I discovered that watching scary game playthroughs is actually way more common than

198
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I thought.

199
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Then I discovered.

200
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Way more common than I thought.

201
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Some of the most popular videos of the game Outlast have millions of views.

202
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Outlast is an indie game and certainly hasn't sold millions of copies.

203
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
So prospects for a sequel are slim at this time.

204
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
So my question to you guys is, do you think streaming is hurting certain genres of games?

205
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
This is a slightly different discussion than Nintendo streaming kerfluffle that happened

206
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
a few months ago.

207
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Because Nintendo games are often games with excellent gameplay and mechanics that makes

208
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
you want to play and want to have your own experience with the game.

209
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Even after.

210
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I'm about to get logged out.

211
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Sorry.

212
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Even after watching someone play it.

213
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
But is that necessarily the same for horror games?

214
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
After seeing the twists and scares, does that make you want to go out and play the game?

215
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,000
And to play Devil's Advocate, were these people just never going to play these games because

216
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
they were too scared to play it by themselves?

217
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I feel like with the easy answer being, let's watch a playthrough on YouTube.

218
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
These people who watch the stream could have mustered up enough courage to get a friend

219
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
or two over and play the game as they are huddled up with blankets over their heads,

220
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
gripping each other in fear.

221
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Is this something we may lose forever due to streaming?

222
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I've rambled enough, but I'd love to hear your thoughts on the issue.

223
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Keep up the great work.

224
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Love always.

225
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
AZHP.

226
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
This is a really good question, and that's why I wanted to pull it at the top of the

227
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
show as a kickoff topic, because it's also timely with Halloween being this next week.

228
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
A lot of people are thinking about scary games, and I'm sure some of you, I don't know

229
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
if you guys do this or maybe people listening, but...

230
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
We have to watch Showgirls.

231
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Everybody has their tradition, and mine is watching Showgirls every Halloween because

232
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,000
it's a scary movie, but I'm sure some of you bring people over and you all play Silent

233
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Hill, or you all play Amnesia.

234
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
We've done that at your old place with Exeter.

235
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Yeah, certainly.

236
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
But this is a really good question.

237
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Just in general, and it doesn't even necessarily have to be about scary games, but is this

238
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,000
new technology in this world that we live in as gamers where Twitch TV is getting more

239
00:11:53,000 --> 00:12:00,000
and more popular and all its knockoffs, is this hurting gaming more than we want to admit?

240
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
No, no one really watches it for the twist.

241
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
They watch it for the people reacting to playing the games is really what it is.

242
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Not me.

243
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I don't really...

244
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I'm with you, because of course my mind is going to go to, if you listen to Hoard House,

245
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,000
you know our buddy Gemet over there is infamous for doing these playthroughs where he screams

246
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
at the top of his lungs while playing Slender Man, and people love it.

247
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
They heat it up.

248
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
That's why it's so popular.

249
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,000
It's not really about the game itself, which I mean, the game's good, but it's watching

250
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
these over the top reactions, which is why people do it, right?

251
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Yeah.

252
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I mean, I saw some footage of Amnesia before.

253
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I just don't remember it.

254
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Well, I remember, and even though I've beaten the game a bajillion times,

255
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I watch playthroughs of Silent Hill 3, because that's my favorite game,

256
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
and sometimes I don't feel like putting it in and playing through everything.

257
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I just want to watch all the cinematics.

258
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,000
For me, it's more or less that I go back and rewatch scenes of games that I've already played,

259
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
especially scenes that I really like.

260
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
The only game, I think, as far as scary games that I've done that with,

261
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
are pretty much games I don't intend to ever play.

262
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I want to see exactly how bad this is type of game.

263
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I'm not as much into Resident Evil anymore, so I watch a playthrough of one of the Resident Evil games

264
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
just to keep up on the story, but I don't really want to play it.

265
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
For me, I don't care.

266
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
If someone was like, oh yeah, let's come over and have a bunch of people

267
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
while we play through this and make fun of it, that's where you get the fun.

268
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Even if you've already seen it, as long as you're not spoiling it for people,

269
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,000
like your friends were spoiling it for you, then that's the difference.

270
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
People just need to have a little bit of respect.

271
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
If they know you haven't played through it before, they need to keep their big mouth shut.

272
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I think the emailer brings up a good point, though,

273
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,000
is that there are probably people out there where they're not sure if they want to buy

274
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
a scary $10, $15 video game that's out there right now.

275
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Let's say Outlast, I think, was the example used in the email.

276
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Somebody might not be sure if they want to get that game yet,

277
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
so they're sampling a little bit on Twitch TV or whatever,

278
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
and so they watch somebody play the game, and then they're like,

279
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
oh, well, I saw all this scary stuff, so I don't really need to buy it now.

280
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Is that a valid concern for the game makers?

281
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I kind of think it's a decent argument.

282
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Now, I sort of think, though, it's twofold.

283
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I kind of think for every person you convince not to buy the game,

284
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I think there's people you also convince to buy the game that may not have done so before.

285
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
So I think there is a little bit of both.

286
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
There's the bad news and there's good news that we might be neglecting here a little bit.

287
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Jason, do you have any thoughts on this?

288
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
And I invite our chat room to respond, too, at luke.com.

289
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I was basically going to say that I agree with what Loki said

290
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,000
in that there's going to be a lot of people that are going to use this as an excuse

291
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
to see a game without playing it, whether it's for saving money,

292
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
whether it's for something that they just didn't get a chance to play.

293
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
But there's nothing wrong with that for the same exact point that you made,

294
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
in that somebody else can get turned on to this.

295
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
A game they didn't hear of, a game they were on the fence for,

296
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
they see a tiny little bit of it, it interests them,

297
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
they want to see the rest of the story around it, and so forth.

298
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
There's a lot of games that come out right now,

299
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
and nobody plays every single one of them.

300
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,000
So having something that kind of fills the void of being able to see what a game was,

301
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
get a story in a universe that you're interested in,

302
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
it's not a bad thing. Everybody does not play all of the same games.

303
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Question for you guys at the table.

304
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Have any of you been convinced to buy a video game because of a live stream?

305
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I want to say I did. I can't remember what it is.

306
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Yeah, well not because of a stream, but it showed a lot of the gameplay in a YouTube video.

307
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
That's how I bought Drunken Robot Pornography.

308
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I mean, yeah, it was more of a review, but he played through a good bit of what had been out,

309
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
and I was like, heck yeah, I want this.

310
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Just listening to the music made me want that game.

311
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I've also picked up indie titles based on going through Twitch and seeing people play.

312
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Surgeon Simulator. 2013.

313
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
That video, I had to buy it after watching that.

314
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I can't think of one off the top of my head that I bought,

315
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:24,000
but I will say that seeing streams convinced me to give Dota 2 a try,

316
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
and League of Legends, and I was kind of ignoring those,

317
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
but because of all the streaming that goes on with that,

318
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I was kind of convinced like, oh, maybe I can try this too.

319
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
That's actually exactly the same point.

320
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:40,000
The last time I was out here, I watched The International 3 with some co-workers,

321
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
and once Dota 2 was finally available for Steam on Mac,

322
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I jumped on that and had a couple friends teach me how to play the game.

323
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I don't want to say I'm good at it by any stretch of the imagination,

324
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
but I'm to the point where I can actually learn on my own

325
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
and sometimes hold up in multiplayer matches.

326
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Going to our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com,

327
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
SSG100Matt says, I really just like watching my friends play games

328
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
and occasionally do hilarious commentary.

329
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
AlanAlchemy with a comment that's teasing Gemet,

330
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
which I'm always here for those.

331
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
AlanAlchemy says, and how Gemet takes his hands off the mouse and keyboard

332
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
and slaps him over his face and stops playing the game when he hasn't even died yet.

333
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
It's hilarious and infuriating.

334
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I'm going to get a nasty call on Skype this week.

335
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
God damn it, Rob Roberts. I heard OLR this week, Rob Roberts,

336
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
and you were talking shit about me again.

337
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
The other side of the coin from this email is party games,

338
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
because party games don't have something that you can spoil.

339
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
You see something livestream that's really fun and you pick it up immediately.

340
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Good point. The first time I saw Mario U was on a livestream.

341
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I didn't buy all that right when it first came out,

342
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
so I kind of saw it all that morning.

343
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Let's see. Looking for more comments in our chat room.

344
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
DarkTetsuya at live.vognetwork.com says,

345
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,000
to me it seems like the horror movie trailers or any trailer in general.

346
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Sure, maybe you've seen some of the game,

347
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
but there's still a good chunk that would surprise you.

348
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:10,000
BlackWolf, our good pal Bobby BlackWolf, who always does the show before us here at VOG Network,

349
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,000
says, well, I almost bought Final Fantasy XIV because of Sky's livestream,

350
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
but I was interested in Hearthstone because of his livestream.

351
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Interested and almost.

352
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
ActDeft actually said exactly the same thing that I wasn't even thinking about,

353
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
is that you played Rogue Legacy,

354
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
and I'll say this again once we hit our gaming weeks,

355
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
but I've been playing a good chunk of that.

356
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Every time I've seen that game, I very much enjoyed it.

357
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
It's a good use of your time.

358
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
It's a great game.

359
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Let me read another comment here, just a couple more.

360
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Duron in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says,

361
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I usually use demos or betas to decide if I want to play a game,

362
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
but this is a nice way if those options aren't available.

363
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
That's a very good point.

364
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
And lastly, I'll say from DungeonBuster here,

365
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I was on the fence with Amnesia a while back

366
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
until I watched a few streams of it and picked it up.

367
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:01,000
So, I mean, a lot of positive, like, yes, the streaming might be doing more good than bad.

368
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Not to dismiss the points of the original email, though,

369
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
but I think there is a little bit of both.

370
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I think there's some of what the emailer was saying,

371
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
and I think there's the other side of,

372
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
yeah, but there's also another audience that may not have bought the game

373
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
that is going to buy the game now,

374
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,000
because it's their friend or somebody they feel a connection to online,

375
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
in the case of, like, the more popular live streamers,

376
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
that, you know, play the game and make it look like a good time.

377
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
So, all right, anyhow, that'll do it for that topic.

378
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Let's get into our gaming weeks.

379
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:34,000
For the record, I actually do totally want to have people in person

380
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
for a good Silent Hill 3 playthrough.

381
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
It'll be fun. Good times.

382
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Actually, one comment I do need to respond to in chat.

383
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Codeman says, Rob, have you played Outlast yet?

384
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I have not. Codeman was kind enough to gift me a copy.

385
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I will say time is running out for me to do that, though,

386
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
because Halloween is this week, so stay tuned.

387
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
And you can't see it, but I'm wiggling my eyebrows.

388
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
So stay tuned. That'll probably happen this week.

389
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,000
All right, let us get to the types of video games that we've been playing this week,

390
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
and how was your gaming week?

391
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
DarkSakura, what have you been up to? What have you been playing?

392
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I haven't been playing Animal Crossing at all.

393
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
You're not playing it right now.

394
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,000
No, not right now. By the way, Normandy's open.

395
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I played Final Fantasy XIV, and I got on a quest that was really pissing me off,

396
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
so I just said, screw it, and got my second job.

397
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:27,000
So I'm at level 10 Thaumaturge, and when I hit 15, maybe tonight,

398
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I'll go back to spamming whatever I have to do as a sorcerer or summoner.

399
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I guess. I don't know how that works.

400
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Anyway, so I'm playing that. I got Gone Home, but I haven't started it yet.

401
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I did play some Super Mario 3D World Land, whatever it is.

402
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Oh yeah, that's right, because you borrowed that from me last year.

403
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Yes, I did. Whatever 3D stuff. Without the 3D, haha.

404
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I also played some Fractal, and I've played Mass Effect 3.

405
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I've played the first Mass Effect because I bought Choddy the first two games on PC,

406
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
and she hasn't been able to get hers to work. I don't know why.

407
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:12,000
So I've been playing mine to walk her through getting all of her stuff set up.

408
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
And now that I'm in the game, I just can't resist rolling another shepherd.

409
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I totally forgot where I was. I have another shepherd that I'm playing as kind of the

410
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
let's see if we can get Garrus to go with the specter path,

411
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,000
which we know that doesn't really happen anyway, so whatever. Spoilers!

412
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:34,000
But I'm playing that one, and I completely forgot where I was.

413
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I haven't even done, like, I think I just finished Novaria, and that's it.

414
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:46,000
So I was playing those, and I was playing something else.

415
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Oh, Dan has broken out the GameCube and is playing the Mimish Cap.

416
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Oh nice.

417
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:58,000
He's like, we've had this game for how long? And I've played it for not how long?

418
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
I'm gonna play it. So that's what all I've been hearing all morning

419
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
is a mix of Animal Crossing music and the Mimish Cap.

420
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Alrighty. There it is, your gaming week. Loki.

421
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
I only played Grand Theft Auto 5.

422
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
What a shock!

423
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I know, shocking. So I've been still trying to go through single player and get 100%,

424
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
so that's what I've been working on.

425
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I finished the flight school stuff, even though I wanted to throw a controller

426
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
when it came to some of the plane stuff.

427
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,000
And then I've been doing my collectibles right now.

428
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:37,000
So I'm going through and finding all the letter scraps and all the spaceship parts.

429
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:42,000
And I've got about, what, seven letter scraps left and three spaceship parts.

430
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:49,000
So thankfully, Rockstar has a wonderful map on their social club that I can go in,

431
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,000
and it actually updates as I get stuff so I know, okay, I have to go here,

432
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,000
have to do this, because no one really wants to just wander the map looking for that shit.

433
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I just want it done immediately so I can get on to the next thing.

434
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,000
And then I'm playing a little bit of online at work,

435
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,000
mostly the PlayStation 3 version, so I'm level 17 in that now.

436
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:15,000
And another VOG gaming night. I think we're gonna take turns on the Fridays,

437
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:20,000
so we'll probably have one next Friday around 8 o'clock.

438
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Haven't decided if it's gonna be PS3 or 360 yet. Probably 360, so stay tuned for that.

439
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
And then, of course, the following week we'll probably do PS3.

440
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Alright, so lots and lots of Grand Theft Auto 5.

441
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,000
And once again, if you want to join the VOG Club on Grand Theft Auto 5,

442
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
all the information is in our forums at vognetwork.com.

443
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Just click on forums at the top of the screen.

444
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Rockstargames.com. I think it's just slash, yeah, slashcrew slash vognetwork.

445
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
And I think last I checked we had 46 people.

446
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Nice.

447
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:00,000
And we now have 50. We hit 50.

448
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
It's climbing. Awesome.

449
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Alright, Jason, our guest here and voiceover guy, what have you been up to?

450
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
This map is really freaking amazing.

451
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,000
I remember when I learned that it was impossible to 100% Just Cause 2,

452
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,000
that it would have been really nice to have something that just shows us where all the items are

453
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:25,000
when you get to like a 90-90% completion rate where running all over the continent is just ridiculous.

454
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Oh yeah, I still have a few orbs I have to get in Crackdown, the first one.

455
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Yeah, same problem. Crackdown is even smaller than Just Cause 2 is, but still...

456
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Yeah, something like that that helps you to the most monotonous grinding possible

457
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
would be incredibly beneficial.

458
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,000
As I said earlier, I've been playing a ton of Rogue Legacy

459
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:51,000
and ripping my hair out with that collectively as well as FTL, Faster Than Light,

460
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:56,000
which has been frustrating because even on easy I can't make it all the way across the galaxy

461
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,000
and I've been very disappointed of this constantly.

462
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,000
I mentioned on Twitter last night that I went out to a friend's house down in San Francisco

463
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,000
and I played Artemis, the Starship bridge simulator for the first time.

464
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,000
We played for something like four hours.

465
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
You gave me glance, have you not heard of this before?

466
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
No I have not, but it sounds interesting.

467
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Artemis, I don't know what's new, what's old, but basically what it amounts to

468
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,000
is that you have a Starship, up to six of them as a matter of fact.

469
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:29,000
You run either a server, or I think it's one server per ship,

470
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:36,000
and you can have up to eight or nine positions that encompass a Starship bridge.

471
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Calms, helm, weapons, engineering, science that actually does shield scanning and whatnot, sector scanning,

472
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
and then obviously the captain is required.

473
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:49,000
I think you basically have to have at least two players, but the more you have the better it is.

474
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:55,000
And you start the game with a given scenario, you have deep space stations,

475
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:03,000
in our case DS 1-4 to protect wormholes, space whales, minefields that you can use to your advantage

476
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,000
or stop paying attention and destroy yourself very quickly.

477
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
It's an incredible amount of fun.

478
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,000
By the way, this game is getting a big response in our chat room here at live.vognetwork.com.

479
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
BlackWolf says, I love Artemis.

480
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Tim trips in chat and says, Artemis is so fun.

481
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
And SHG100Matt says, Artemis is at PAX East, right?

482
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:26,000
I think it was. I don't remember. I didn't go, but I think it was one of those games.

483
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:31,000
I've seen a ton of footage and the places they can take the main screen, the bridge screen,

484
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:36,000
and make it gigantic and have all of the stations situated strategically.

485
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:42,000
There's an immense amount of potential to take that game, make the experience as fun as possible

486
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
and as good as you want it to be.

487
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,000
I am looking at footage of this game on YouTube that Bobby sent me.

488
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Look at that, a Let's Play I'm using to look at the game.

489
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
So yeah, this looks like they're having fun.

490
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
They're all kind of sitting around the table on all their little laptops yelling at each other.

491
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
That's cool.

492
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
There is an Artemis II version now, which we didn't play.

493
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
My voice is a little scratchier than usual.

494
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,000
And that's because between the five of us at my buddy's place,

495
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
we were shouting back and forth at each other.

496
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Just in the sheer hectic nature, our engineer was balancing power levels for systems

497
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:23,000
and didn't always react to the captain or just in advance I would say,

498
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,000
hey engineering, do I have power to maneuverability?

499
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
That sounds like a lot of fun.

500
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
It is so fun.

501
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:35,000
I got to be honest though, if they were to slap Star Trek onto this,

502
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,000
I know I shouldn't say that because it's an indie game and let it grow and be its own thing,

503
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
but I have to say, can you imagine if they could slap Star Trek onto this?

504
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
It would basically be a Star Trek LARP.

505
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
People would so be there.

506
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,000
They tried doing console Star Trek games that just did not take off.

507
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,000
With the intent of being a simulator.

508
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Well even Raginator wants to know in our chat room,

509
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:02,000
does it help to say engage or make it so or speak like Shatner when playing Artemis?

510
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:10,000
The captain did not take the role of a particular character from any universe like that,

511
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,000
but I would use those words because I was doing helm

512
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:20,000
and so we would have the rotation of the ship and you can also have a warp or a jump ship.

513
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Jump being you instantly go to a certain place of course and warp the progressively high rate traveling.

514
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:32,000
He'll give me coordinates and I will say locked in or coordinates engaged or jump engaged,

515
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
10 seconds to jump, all that kind of stuff.

516
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:41,000
We had fun with it and it kind of comes with the territory of us all being the geeks that we are.

517
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Of course.

518
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
We didn't take specific characters, but we had a hell of a lot of fun with it.

519
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Tim Trip in our chat room says, I basically pretend it's Star Trek anyways.

520
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Okay, it's not just me.

521
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Revision3 has a short little video of this game

522
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:00,000
and they are all dressed up in Star Trek appropriate attire, uniforms and everything,

523
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
color appropriate and the whole thing.

524
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:07,000
I will say that our weapons individual was the space cowboy

525
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
and he was playing that character very, very well.

526
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,000
I'm sorry, I'm just cracking up at chat because Tim Trip follows up with saying,

527
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:19,000
practice is my best Janeway voice, which Xdefer over at Horde House does this so much better than I do.

528
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:24,000
But you know, that's all Tom Paris, Tom, Harry Kim, Harry Kim, Tom Paris, Tom Paris.

529
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,000
That's all he does is yell those two names over and over, but it's funny.

530
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
I've been watching through Voyager.

531
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Yeah, it was a good show. It was underrated.

532
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
So, anyway, all right.

533
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
You know what?

534
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
What?

535
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
No, it wasn't.

536
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Voyager was full of bad decision after bad decision and Janeway going, fuck it, I'm Janeway,

537
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
we're in the middle of Delta Space, I don't have to follow shit.

538
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
And that's the tale of Voyager.

539
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
I'm not asking for directions.

540
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
I am the direction.

541
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
It's a real trip though to see Janeway on Orange is the New Black.

542
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
I'm just saying it's a different role for her.

543
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Okay, anyhow.

544
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Oh shit, that was her.

545
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
I didn't even realize it after watching.

546
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
No, it didn't even click.

547
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Wow.

548
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:14,000
And there's also McCoy on some cops SWAT something I saw a commercial for.

549
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Obviously, Abram vs. McCoy is on some new TV show and that's quite a jump.

550
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Oh my God.

551
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,000
I love you Game Guru because you know SF Debris.

552
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:29,000
If you ever want to see the funniest mockery of the Janeway voice ever, go to SF Debris.

553
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,000
I was going to say, you know, Voyager had some pretty epic guest stars.

554
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Like Sarah Silverman was a guest star on an episode of Voyager.

555
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,000
And she wasn't being her typical over the top hilarity.

556
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
She was playing it serious, so it's so funny to see her on the show.

557
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,000
You know, like, I'm going on the Voyager.

558
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:52,000
I just can't help but think always though of Maria Bamford doing her,

559
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,000
I used to work at the Star Trek experience as a Bajoran.

560
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Her Bajoran refugee voice.

561
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,000
I can never get that out of my head whenever I think of Star Trek.

562
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Bobby Black Wolf says, I hear Orange is the New Black is better if you pretend it's just Janeway in the holodeck.

563
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
It could be her fantasy.

564
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
This is getting way too far away from video games. Way too far.

565
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Just the expanse of the Star Trek universe.

566
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Look what this Artemis game does to people.

567
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Alright, I'm kidding.

568
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:25,000
I think we've also just admitted that we know way too much about Voyager than we should say in public.

569
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
I know nothing about Voyager other than, you know...

570
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:35,000
I will however watch an entire season of Voyager before I watch any more Enterprise.

571
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
There you go.

572
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,000
You know, true story, the first time I ever got drunk was at the Star Trek experience.

573
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,000
First time in my life I ever got drunk was at the Warp Core Breach.

574
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
I love those things.

575
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Fucking Travis over at Understation Live here at VOG Network has the voicemail thing.

576
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Anyway, long story that I'm not going to recap.

577
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,000
By the way, I did find in Las Vegas a replacement for the Warp Core Breach.

578
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Oh, what's that?

579
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,000
It's at this place at the Paris casino.

580
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Their little dessert bar, whatever place, has fuzzy drinks with foam coming up out of it like the Warp Core Breach.

581
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
And whatever their red one is tastes like Warp Core Breach.

582
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Nice.

583
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,000
I just don't remember what it was called. It was red and I was drunk.

584
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Nice. I gotta go to Vegas one of these times.

585
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:20,000
A friend of mine is trying to talk me into going to New Media Expo, which I think is right around the time as CES.

586
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,000
So it's like, oh, if I could do a double and do both those cons it would be a lot of fun.

587
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,000
But anyway, let's talk about my gaming week and the type of stuff that I've been playing this week.

588
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Which, you know, much like Loki, I still have been playing plenty of Final Fantasy XIV.

589
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
We perfected earlier today speedruns of Wanderer's Palace.

590
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Which, if you know the endgame, that's one of the instances that you can do in the endgame.

591
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
And we're able to knock that place out in about 15 minutes.

592
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Which doesn't beat the record of 8 minutes, but it's still pretty good considering we don't have the optimal group.

593
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
But anyway, other games I've been playing this week.

594
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Not a whole lot of new stuff, but I did play a new port of a game I already played.

595
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
And that's Hotline Miami.

596
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Because Hotline Miami is free on PlayStation Plus right now on PlayStation 3 and PS Vita.

597
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,000
And if you are a PlayStation Plus subscriber, you really do need to check out this game.

598
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,000
I can't confess to having played a lot of it.

599
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Just because it's really difficult and kind of, like, it takes a bit of getting used to the game.

600
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
But I really like the style.

601
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:23,000
It's got, you know, a very retro style to it, but the soundtrack is so good.

602
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
And I'm sure a lot of people are...

603
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Isn't it?

604
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Oh yeah, it's great.

605
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
I love the soundtrack.

606
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
I just sit there and listen to that on loop as I'm dying over and over.

607
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:35,000
But it's a very fast-paced game, and in the retro sense, I find a lot of it is about memorization.

608
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Like, okay, here, you're going to go onto this floor in this house that you're invading for whatever reason.

609
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:45,000
And I'm going to go kill that guy, and then I'm going to take his weapon, and then go kill that guy, and that guy.

610
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,000
And then I've got to run over here and lure that guy out so I can kill him.

611
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Like, you start to think of the memorization.

612
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Like, it's a Mega Man level or something, like in retro.

613
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,000
So, you know, I know that it's a lot of trial and error.

614
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:00,000
But unfortunately for me, I tend to error a lot more than I do succeed.

615
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,000
But it's something about the soundtrack of that game kind of, like, gets you going.

616
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
And yeah, I want to play more of that.

617
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
So I was having a lot of fun with that on PlayStation 3.

618
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,000
So again, if you have PlayStation Plus, check it out.

619
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
It's free.

620
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,000
You really have no reason at this point not to.

621
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,000
And even, I'm sure it'll be discounted on Steam.

622
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,000
And I don't think it's a very expensive game to begin with on any of the platforms it's on.

623
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:28,000
So it's worth the money if you like old retro puzzle memorization games.

624
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:33,000
And if you like an abundance of violence with your retro games.

625
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Because I will tell you, there's an abundance of violence in this game.

626
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
And shooting dogs.

627
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Alan Alchemy in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com backing us up.

628
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,000
It absolutely needs memorization to get through it.

629
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
So, all right.

630
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Let's see.

631
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Other games that I've been playing this week.

632
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
I did play a game.

633
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
It's not a new game, but it's new to me.

634
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
It's called Midway Arcade Origins.

635
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Which is a retro game collection that's available.

636
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
I think it's on 360 and PS3.

637
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Don't know about Wii or Wii U.

638
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
I don't think it's there.

639
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
I think it's only on the others.

640
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Here's the thing.

641
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,000
The Midway game collection's kind of been done before.

642
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
And I actually rented this.

643
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Because I was a little hesitant to buy it.

644
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Because, well, I already have Midway Arcade Treasures on PlayStation 2.

645
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Like, there's three different volumes of it, right?

646
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
I have all three volumes.

647
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:27,000
So most of the games in this I already have in one way or another.

648
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:31,000
And I think they even had on the PlayStation 1 some of these games were available.

649
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:35,000
And it's kind of funny because some of these games we've seen before this generation.

650
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Joust was an early $5 Xbox Live arcade game.

651
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,000
And that's in the collection now for, you know, what?

652
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,000
I find this for $19.99 on Amazon at this point or gaming stores to buy this new.

653
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,000
And I'm trying to think of some of the other games.

654
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
I think Defender. Wasn't Defender an Xbox Live game at some point too?

655
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
I think they redid that.

656
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Well, anyway, those are some of the games that are in the collection.

657
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Some of the other highlights for me.

658
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Marble Madness. Love that game, right?

659
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
That's in the collection.

660
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Rampart is a personal favorite of mine.

661
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:08,000
That's the game that's like Tetris meets you roll the trackball around and shoot things.

662
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
The ships.

663
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
I don't know if you guys know this game.

664
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Rampart was really cool. Google it if you haven't heard of it yet.

665
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Or maybe Dark Soccer will do it as a classic game later.

666
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Maybe.

667
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Don't you like Rampart?

668
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Not really.

669
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:27,000
But I will tell you, this was the game that I don't think was in any of the older collections that I was really giddy.

670
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,000
And it's Super Offroad.

671
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Which originally used to be Iron Man Stewart's Super Offroad.

672
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,000
But I guess since, you know, they don't have the license with him anymore.

673
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Just like Punch Out isn't Mike Tyson anymore.

674
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Exactly. They gave him a mustache and just photoshopped his name out.

675
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
So now it's just Super Offroad or whatever.

676
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
But I had a lot of fun playing that game.

677
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Although I will say, it loses a little something when you don't have the steering wheel that you can just spin around uncontrollably.

678
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Remember, like, they were totally fake steering wheels.

679
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
And they had no stop on the left or the right side.

680
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:01,000
So when you were a kid, you would just spin that thing like crazy when you're trying to turn around.

681
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
And it was a lot of fun.

682
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,000
It doesn't translate the same way to the thumb sticks.

683
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,000
But it's an awful lot of fun to kind of have that whole experience.

684
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Because I don't remember an arcade perfect version of that.

685
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,000
I know on the NES they had a version of that.

686
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:19,000
But it was a little, you know, scaled down in the graphics and so forth.

687
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Although it was one of the few, if I remember, it was one of the few four player multi-tap games on the NES.

688
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
If I'm not mistaken.

689
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:29,000
They redid it on the SNES too that dramatically improved on the NES version.

690
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
I don't think it was arcade perfect.

691
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
And, you know, probably intentionally so.

692
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:37,000
The lack of credits and coins and the need to re-up and that kind of thing.

693
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Yeah, I remember when I was a kid, if ever there was a Super Off-Road strategically positioned in a walkable area.

694
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:50,000
I would walk by and just throw all the steering wheels so they're all spinning uncontrollably in the same direction.

695
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:57,000
DarkTetsuya and GameGuru, both in our chatroom, telling me that Midway Treasures 3 actually did have Super Off-Road in it.

696
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
I just don't remember that.

697
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
And to be honest, I'm looking over at my collection.

698
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,000
I actually have Midway Arcade Treasures 1 and 2, so I guess I never picked up 3.

699
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,000
3 had Hydro Thunder and it was all racing games, right?

700
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
I wonder why I skipped that one.

701
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,000
I remember having to seek out 3 on the PS2 for a very specific purpose.

702
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,000
And I don't think it was Off-Road, but I know there was some other game that I wanted in it.

703
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,000
So anyway, as far as retro classic game collections go, it's fine.

704
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Especially if you don't have these games already in one way or the other.

705
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
It's kind of neat to have them again.

706
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:29,000
And yeah, they've got the leaderboard and the trophies and, you know, that's that.

707
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Otherwise, you know, not a lot to scream about.

708
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:37,000
But if you're a retro gaming fan, it's really nice to see them in the crisp HD.

709
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
And you can put different filters on the graphics too.

710
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
You can have it super sharp or smooth, you know.

711
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
So you can do those little things.

712
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:50,000
And, you know, especially now that the title is a budget title, it would be worth your time if you like retro games.

713
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Anyhow, that does it for my gaming week.

714
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
So let's quickly do some housekeeping.

715
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Don't forget you can add us on Twitter, twitter.com slash o-l-r.

716
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,000
And we're also on Facebook, facebook.com slash orange lounge radio.

717
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
We appreciate all our friends on those sites.

718
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,000
We're also on Google Plus, as we'll get to later in the show.

719
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:14,000
And I do want to remind you guys, I mentioned this last week and just want to remind you guys, there will be no new show in two weeks.

720
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
We will have the night off.

721
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:20,000
So we'll be here next week on November 3rd, if I'm thinking right with the dates.

722
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:26,000
But we will not be here on November 10th, because I will be coming back from Los Angeles and my not BlizzCon trip.

723
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
And I get to trash your house.

724
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Dark Sakura will be house sitting and Kitty sitting.

725
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
I got paid in Duffy.

726
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Yes, as she kindly offered to do.

727
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
I would have done it for free.

728
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
I know.

729
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
But thanks for the Duffy.

730
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
You're welcome. I've been sitting on that for like three months.

731
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Now?

732
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Not literally.

733
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
But anyway, yeah, we won't be here November 10th.

734
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
I'm going on my not BlizzCon trip.

735
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
You'll probably hear more about this on Horde House.

736
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:55,000
But I missed out on getting BlizzCon tickets because I thought I would be doing something else that weekend.

737
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
And it unfortunately fell through.

738
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,000
It's kind of a sad situation, but it is what it is.

739
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
And I'm no longer going to Phoenix.

740
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:06,000
So I said, fine, I'll go to BlizzCon, except there's no way I can get a ticket now.

741
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,000
And, you know, BlizzCon is a fortress to get in its media.

742
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
You're either on their list or you're not.

743
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:17,000
So I'm just going to go to the parties and then go to Disneyland, which is BlizzCon enough, right?

744
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
BlizzCon.

745
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Yeah, exactly. I'm making a BlizzCon out of it. Why not?

746
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Well, seriously, you run into people in the park because I did that a couple years ago when they...

747
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Not when they... They didn't have it last year, but the year before.

748
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Right, yeah.

749
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
I actually would run into people who are wearing like WoW t-shirts and say,

750
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,000
BlizzCon! And they go, hell yeah!

751
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
So yeah, that'll be on Sunday.

752
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,000
That was when I was really into WoW and Dan would just roll his eyes and go wander in the other direction.

753
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Yeah, BlizzCon is on the Sunday, the official BlizzCon, but we're making a run of it.

754
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
I'm going to be going to an event. I should plug this.

755
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,000
If you're going to be at BlizzCon and for whatever reason you're not listening to Horde House, my other show,

756
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:55,000
I'm going to be at an event called World of Podcasts, which is Thursday night. I'll be there.

757
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:00,000
I'm not featured because, again, I wasn't planning on going, so I missed the boat on all that stuff.

758
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,000
But Grandpa from our show is on one of the panels over there.

759
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,000
So yeah, I'll be at World of Podcasts, so if you're going to be there, come say hi.

760
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
And say hi to Grandpa as well.

761
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:12,000
And then I don't know, whatever else I get invited to Friday or Saturday, we'll go to that too.

762
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Although Alan and I are going to try to do a Carthay Circle dinner one of those nights.

763
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Probably Saturday night, because I think that's when the closing ceremonies are,

764
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,000
so there's usually not a lot going around because they usually have a big old concert.

765
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Although they didn't announce any big, there's no Ozzy Osbourne or anything this year.

766
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,000
So I don't know what they're doing for the closing ceremonies. It's got to be a secret.

767
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
It's a secret to everybody.

768
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
It is a secret to everybody.

769
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Alright, let's move on with some gaming news.

770
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
And Loki, going to start us off tonight.

771
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Alright, there's a rumor that's, I guess, going on, saying that there's going to be a brand new...

772
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Sorry, you know it's a slow gaming week when we have to start off, or a slow news week in gaming,

773
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
when we have to start off with a rumor.

774
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:57,000
So I apologize in advance, but it's not the best week in news.

775
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
There's nothing to talk about.

776
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Yeah, we're stretching tonight. Fully admitting. Fully admitting.

777
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Like, Lisa, I'm not covering that story about NASCAR being, you know, the rights for NASCAR going to Deep Silver,

778
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
because no one fucking cares.

779
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Anyways, I know there's Regnut out there who still has his gaming console that he stole.

780
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:25,000
So there's this series that, I guess, they're calling Reimagined, because that's dumb.

781
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:32,000
It's supposed to be, I guess, seven Nintendo 64 games that are being redone in HD.

782
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:39,000
And, God, I hope they're really actually redoing everything if they're actually going to do this and not just upresing them,

783
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
because it's going to look like shit.

784
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,000
It's also going to look weird, too, because they're not going to be all fuzzy and cloudy anymore.

785
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:51,000
They're also saying that, I guess, all seven games would feature new content and retail at $30.

786
00:42:51,000 --> 00:43:00,000
And the idea is, I guess, Nintendo would be filling in the gaps in their Wii U lineup by re-releasing older Nintendo 64 games.

787
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Here's kind of a funny part, though, about that, is they are already filling...

788
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Well, I should say their lineup is already including older games that are being remade, like Wind Waker HD, for example.

789
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Or even before the Wii U, they had their new play control games, which they literally did nothing to except for change the control on it.

790
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Oh, hey, now it uses a Wii remote instead of a GameCube controller, because that's so much better.

791
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
It's not, though.

792
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:34,000
And, yeah, one of the rumors, of course, is that Mario 64 is going to be the first game.

793
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Yeah, of course it's going to be Mario 64.

794
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
They're not going to do Superman 64.

795
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Hey, let's leave with that.

796
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Mario Kart 64 would cannibalize a little bit on Mario Kart 8.

797
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:50,000
I don't think... I mean, I could see them doing something like this, but I would think, if anything,

798
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:56,000
I just don't know how much of a draw there's really going to be for people to get HD versions of these games.

799
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:02,000
I mean, I'm sure some people will be interested in it, but I don't know.

800
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:06,000
I would think they'd be better off just doing, like, you know...

801
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:12,000
I could see this maybe for, you know, the 3DS, because remember they did this with, like, you know,

802
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Alcarina and Star Fox and that kind of stuff. I could see that happening, but...

803
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,000
I don't know. It just sounds like a rumor to me. Whatever.

804
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Well, you know, I realize it's a big old rumor, and Nintendo remaking their games wouldn't exactly be out of character for them or whatever, right?

805
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
No, yeah.

806
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:42,000
But, you know, it seems like it's not a very long process for them, and the games turn out pretty well received.

807
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Like, I'm thinking of the Zelda Wind Waker HD thing.

808
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Yeah, but the problem with Wind Waker HD, though, is that it had way better graphics than, you know, the GameCube...

809
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Well, because it was a GameCube game. It wasn't that different than, you know, a regular Wii game or something like that.

810
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,000
So it wasn't... They weren't doing a whole lot.

811
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Whereas if you were doing Mario or, like, any of the Nintendo 64 stuff, you're going to have to do quite a bit to that to make it look nice.

812
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Because just up-resing it and making the polys look nicer and stuff, it's going to look like...

813
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:21,000
I mean, fuck, you can just pull it up on YouTube and look at any of the emulators out there that do any sort of up-scaling on that stuff, and it just...

814
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
It doesn't look that good.

815
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Like, even when I ran stuff in, like, an emulator on, like, the Ouya and stuff, and that sort of did some up-resing and stuff,

816
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:36,000
it just doesn't look good on your TV because, yeah, everything's smoother looking, but it's just so empty because those games, you know, couldn't...

817
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:43,000
They couldn't do very far draw distances or, you know, they didn't have a lot of detail in there because it couldn't handle it.

818
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:46,000
It's just... I don't know.

819
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:50,000
It's a neat idea, but I just don't know how well it's going to look.

820
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
We'll see, I guess.

821
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
SSJ100Matt with a comment in our chat room.

822
00:45:54,000 --> 00:46:00,000
At live.vognetwork.com, the recent Mario Kart games have had the older tracks remade into the new games.

823
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,000
That's another good reason why a Mario Kart 64 would be a little redundant.

824
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Yeah, you know, as much as I like playing the older tracks, I think that's such a cop-out of, like,

825
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:11,000
hey, look, we get double the content now without having to do anything.

826
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Well, it would be really... I do think they could release a bunch of old tracks as DLC.

827
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
I think that would be really cool.

828
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,000
So why not?

829
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Why not have the balls and put a fucking track editor in there?

830
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:25,000
Oh, you afraid that people are going to come up with better track designs than your own?

831
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:29,000
But, Loki, somebody might draw a penis as a track.

832
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:32,000
Not me. I've decided I know what track I would design.

833
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Boobs.

834
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
No, even better.

835
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,000
What?

836
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
I would have the full-on vag track.

837
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
You know, with the little lube.

838
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
I knew you were dirtying it up somewhere.

839
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Oh, come on.

840
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:46,000
I think it's, like, totally unfair to automatically assume that people are going to put a penis in

841
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
when it is much better to put a vag in.

842
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Well, my next guess was boobs.

843
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Oh, okay. I'll tell you why.

844
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,000
I'll tell you why it's easy for people to put a penis in there, because

845
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
who is the demographic for these games?

846
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Teenage boys and prepubescent boys.

847
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,000
What have they seen?

848
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
They've seen their penis.

849
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,000
What have they not seen?

850
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,000
They have not seen a vagina.

851
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,000
And this would be the only way they ever would.

852
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
So, of course, it's gonna-

853
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
I would be doing them a favor.

854
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
It's familiar territory.

855
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,000
You didn't see fucking Bob Ross painting buildings and cars.

856
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,000
You saw him painting trees, because that's the way he knew.

857
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,000
He knew trees.

858
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
Just like kids, they know penises.

859
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,000
And bushes.

860
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:26,000
If you want to be technical, it had to do with his painting style, but that's a different thing.

861
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,000
God dammit, I want to see a fuzzy fucking building.

862
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,000
He can do it.

863
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
Alan Alchemy.

864
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,000
From the grave.

865
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Alan Alchemy in our chatroom at live.voguenetwork.com suggesting a name for your track, Dark Soccer,

866
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
of Vulva Vroom.

867
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
I approve of this.

868
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
It will officially be called the Vulva Vroom.

869
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:47,000
I think Dark Soccer should have, like, a sex education game on the Wii U.

870
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:51,000
Like, you know, instead of Dr. Joyce Brothers or whatever, or Dr. Ruth-

871
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Foost, do you lose-

872
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
I can't do the Dr. Joyce.

873
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:58,000
No, it'll be more like the sex education teacher in Beavis and Butthead.

874
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Dark Soccer would just walk out.

875
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
Today we're gonna talk about the penis.

876
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
We're gonna talk about the vagina.

877
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,000
That's the coach.

878
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,000
Oh yeah, I'm sorry.

879
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Whatever he was.

880
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Isn't he the same guy?

881
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Yeah.

882
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,000
He'd feel like all the alternative-

883
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Coach Buzzcut.

884
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Yeah.

885
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Kick me in the jibby.

886
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:20,000
So is that like, you know, Mario teaches typing, it's Birdo teaches sex ed or something like that?

887
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:25,000
Teaching- this is all the stuff that I didn't want and I had it changed.

888
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:29,000
So, you could even have it on the Wii U.

889
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:34,000
You could be like, now touch where you're gonna find the G spot.

890
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:39,000
And then the person touches, no, this is why you'll never get laid.

891
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Show me on the touchpad where they touched you.

892
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,000
You get the orgasm trophy.

893
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
They don't have trophies on Wii U, Dark Soccer.

894
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Well, I don't have a Wii U, so I don't care.

895
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:55,000
And-

896
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Was there more with that, Loki?

897
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,000
I'm sorry.

898
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
I think I cut you off and suddenly we-

899
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,000
No, we were done talking.

900
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
We were in playground chat at that point.

901
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,000
We were done talking.

902
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,000
It's a rumor.

903
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,000
Rumor, rumor, rumor.

904
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Rumor, rumor, rumor.

905
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:10,000
There's another joke there about the name of the game and for some strange reason I

906
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
just can't put the words together.

907
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
Something something and we use-

908
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
What was the name of this game?

909
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,000
Reumagined?

910
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Reumagined, yes.

911
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Reumagined.

912
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:23,000
It honestly sounds like a special episode of RuPaul's Drag Race.

913
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Like, Ru-U-magined or something.

914
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Is that what they're calling it?

915
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Is that what the Lost episodes that they're calling it on TV right now?

916
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
You know I've never watched an episode of that.

917
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,000
The Ruvives episodes.

918
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
How are we friends?

919
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,000
I mean to.

920
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
I used to watch Drag U.

921
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,000
Oh, okay.

922
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,000
Well, similar.

923
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,000
Then you know enough.

924
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:44,000
Because I like seeing, as much as Ru makes a gorgeous woman, I loved the suits.

925
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,000
It was all about the suits.

926
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,000
That red suit.

927
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,000
Ah.

928
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,000
Tim Tripp in our chat says,

929
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,000
I just had a moment where I thought I was listening to Hoard House, but we didn't have

930
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Grandpa say something racially insensitive.

931
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:56,000
So it's not truly an episode of Hoard House at this point.

932
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
Let's move on quickly before we go there.

933
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Maybe I'm just channeling X to fur in an entirely feminine manner.

934
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,000
I haven't brought up, you know, bleaching the part.

935
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Next story is about Nintendo as well.

936
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Talking about cross-play titles.

937
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:18,000
You know right now most cross-play we think of on PlayStation with PS3 or 4 and the PlayStation Vita.

938
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,000
In fact Hotline Miami, I was talking about earlier in the show.

939
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:24,000
When you download that you get a Vita version and a PlayStation 3 version.

940
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,000
And all your saves transfer through the cloud.

941
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
It's all through the cloud.

942
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
So you can pick up your bloody murder right where you left off.

943
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:35,000
And so a lot of people are asking, well when the hell is the 3DS and the Wii U gonna get on board?

944
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:39,000
And of course the answer is when Nintendo understands online.

945
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Or it's when they decide, because I have to remind everybody every single week.

946
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
It's when they decide to, hey guess what?

947
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:52,000
We're gonna do the 3DS virtual console on the Wii U.

948
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:55,000
Because it has two screens and the same damn controls.

949
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
And you can fucking do any 3DS game on there.

950
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
They're just not doing it yet.

951
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:02,000
Alright well Nintendo has come out and said quote.

952
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:10,000
We can confirm that cross-platform functionality is possible in certain titles that play on Nintendo 3DS and Wii U.

953
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
As well as, I almost said Vita.

954
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:15,000
As well as other video game systems not made by Nintendo.

955
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
And the reasoning behind that, just so you know.

956
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
This is because of pure chess.

957
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:22,000
Which you can actually play on the Wii U.

958
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:25,000
But you can also cross-play with Playstation 3 and Vita.

959
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Now the reason why this is news.

960
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:34,000
Is because this is a huge reason why you do not see Final Fantasy XIV on the Xbox 360.

961
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Square wanted to put it on the 360.

962
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:41,000
But Microsoft said, no we will not support the cross-play element.

963
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:45,000
You will not be able to, Xbox has to be its own server, its own world and everything.

964
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Xbox will not cross-play.

965
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:53,000
Which is funny because Final Fantasy XI was totally not like that and had play online.

966
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:56,000
But you have to go back a few years.

967
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:00,000
Microsoft was desperate to have a Final Fantasy game on the 360.

968
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,000
So they broke their own rule in that case only.

969
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:07,000
And that's why you got 13 later on on the 360 which was controversial.

970
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
But I digress, back to Nintendo.

971
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:15,000
We are committed to helping developers realize the full potential of their software on Nintendo systems.

972
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:18,000
We can confirm that Disney Infinity from Disney Interactive Studios.

973
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Cubeman 2 from 3 Sprockets and Pure Chess from Ripstone.

974
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:25,000
All have the ability to play on Nintendo systems.

975
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:29,000
While at the same time communicating with consumers using those same games on other systems.

976
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Additional games using this functionality are in development.

977
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,000
Smash Brothers.

978
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
I thought that, well not cross system.

979
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:39,000
I didn't think that the Wii U had an online portion for Disney Infinity.

980
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:43,000
Because I know they were, I think maybe it was limited to two players only.

981
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:47,000
But I thought that that was something that was taken out of.

982
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:50,000
I can't speak first hand because I haven't played Disney Infinity.

983
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,000
Maybe I'm thinking the Wii version.

984
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,000
I'm not aware of that.

985
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
I think you're thinking of either the regular Wii version.

986
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,000
But I think the Wii U is comparable to the other systems.

987
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
So I don't think that's, maybe somebody in chat knows.

988
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Well it's nice that different consoles play together.

989
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
I wish it was kind of like that for everything.

990
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:07,000
Instead of this nonsense that we have going on now.

991
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
It's a little weird to me that Microsoft won't allow it.

992
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:14,000
Because what is one of the big features that they're touting on the Xbox One that has nothing to do with video games?

993
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,000
Anybody?

994
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,000
TV, TV, TV, TV.

995
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
What do you do when you watch TV?

996
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,000
You can.

997
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,000
TV.

998
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,000
What can you do by moving your hand?

999
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,000
You can.

1000
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,000
Anyone?

1001
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,000
Anyone?

1002
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,000
You can Skype.

1003
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Flip off the characters.

1004
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,000
That's it.

1005
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Skype.

1006
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
But isn't Skype cross platform by default?

1007
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
I can Skype on my iPhone.

1008
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
I can Skype on my computer.

1009
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:37,000
So why is Skype okay?

1010
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Is it because it's a Microsoft product?

1011
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,000
I don't know.

1012
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
Why is Skype okay when all this other stuff isn't?

1013
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
Microsoft bought Skype.

1014
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
It is now.

1015
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
Obviously it didn't start as one for a long time.

1016
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
It's touting Skype.

1017
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:54,000
Oh you can Skype your other Xbox One playing, owning individuals.

1018
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,000
Well that's just the same voice and video chat they've already had on their network.

1019
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:00,000
If you go to Skype.com you have that whole Metro look.

1020
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:05,000
And to go on yet another tangent away from what the story was supposed to be about, but

1021
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:10,000
I can't help myself, Skype, very controversial patch coming soon to Skype.

1022
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:17,000
And the 6.1 patch that's due out in December, they are going to block third party apps.

1023
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:22,000
And this is very controversial because many people record their podcasts over Skype using

1024
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
a program like Call Graph.

1025
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
We actually did Hoard House with that for a while.

1026
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Or Pamela I think one is called.

1027
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:32,000
There's all these different programs people use in Skype to do their podcasts.

1028
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:35,000
They're going to be screwed because Skype is disabling access to this.

1029
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:40,000
Oh I kind of figured you would have meant things like there's a lot of instant messaging

1030
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:45,000
apps that can use Skype for text messaging but not voice and video calls.

1031
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Yeah so it's a very controversial thing going into effect.

1032
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
Thank you Xbox One.

1033
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:54,000
It won't affect this show or Hoard House because we don't do it that way.

1034
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
Even though Hoard House is done over Skype, everything.

1035
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:00,000
I have a sound card that supports a native recording of what you hear.

1036
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:04,000
And so if you are a podcaster out there wondering like shit, shit, what am I going to do?

1037
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,000
Shit.

1038
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:09,000
I really urge you to look for a Sound Blaster brand card that has a feature in it called

1039
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
What You, the letter you, hear.

1040
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:14,000
And it's made recording for this show so much easier.

1041
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:17,000
And I think if you're willing to drop the 40 bucks on like an external sound card it'll

1042
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
save you a lot of trouble too.

1043
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,000
If it's in your budget.

1044
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,000
I know it's not in everybody's budget but yeah.

1045
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:26,000
We've been using the same, just to put it in perspective, we've been using the same

1046
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:29,000
sound card for OLR since 2002.

1047
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:33,000
We moved the sound card from computer to computer.

1048
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,000
My old laptop had all that too.

1049
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:39,000
That's actually how I used to record BBC Radio 1.

1050
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,000
I'd record interviews off of that.

1051
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,000
Nice.

1052
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,000
Very nice.

1053
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:47,000
So yeah Nintendo cross play.

1054
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:50,000
No, it's a good thing.

1055
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:53,000
And you know who does Nintendo best?

1056
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,000
Nintendo.

1057
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:57,000
So I'm looking forward to seeing what they do with this.

1058
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:01,000
And I think Smash Brothers seems like the obvious candidate.

1059
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:04,000
What's going to be that synergy between the 3DS and the Wii U version that we don't know

1060
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,000
about yet.

1061
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
There's definitely going to be something there.

1062
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,000
What is it?

1063
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,000
Don't know yet.

1064
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,000
We'll find out.

1065
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:16,000
I still, there's that part of me, tin foil hat mode, going a very similar direction to

1066
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:20,000
what Loki's saying is that, oh well, soon you're going to be able to play 3DS games

1067
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,000
on the Wii U.

1068
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:26,000
I kind of think, because we got the 2DS this year, which you know, it's a thing.

1069
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,000
It's a new system.

1070
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
Did I tell you I played one of those this week?

1071
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,000
I don't think I did.

1072
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:33,000
One of my friends has a 2DS and I played the 2DS this week.

1073
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,000
It feels nice.

1074
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
It has a good ergo to it.

1075
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,000
Anyway.

1076
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:41,000
Next year we ought to be due for some type of new handheld out of Nintendo, right?

1077
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:45,000
I mean, even though we don't need one per se, that isn't going to stop them from making

1078
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,000
one.

1079
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:52,000
What if they make some type of 3DS that can double as, wait for it, a Wii U touchpad?

1080
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:56,000
Because there's all the outcry out there for, how can I buy a second touchpad?

1081
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,000
How can I do it?

1082
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,000
What if the second touchpad is a 3DS?

1083
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:02,000
We also need something in the portable consoles that supports the Nintendo network.

1084
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,000
Why not?

1085
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,000
Because the 3DS still does friend codes.

1086
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,000
Ooh.

1087
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:08,000
Uh, yes, but at least it's a universal friend code.

1088
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,000
True.

1089
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,000
Yeah.

1090
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
I mean, the system's a hell of a lot better than the original DS.

1091
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:16,000
It's just the fact that we haven't seen it in a firmware update yet.

1092
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Obviously we still can in the next year.

1093
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:23,000
But especially for Smash Brothers and what they want to continue to do down the road,

1094
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:27,000
their portable system needs to come in line and start supporting these same things that

1095
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,000
the Wii U does.

1096
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:32,000
Code Man in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, Rob, is the screens too small?

1097
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,000
It doesn't have to be.

1098
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:37,000
And I'm not saying they're going to make this giant 3DS that's as big as one of those touchpads.

1099
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,000
What has to be the same?

1100
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,000
The resolution has to be the same, not the size.

1101
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:45,000
So it's very possible that that could happen.

1102
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:48,000
I'm tinfoil-hatting and making shit up, admittedly.

1103
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,000
Why not?

1104
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:53,000
It's rumor week on OLR because it's that week in gaming news, so there you go.

1105
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
It's rumor week.

1106
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,000
That's right, rumors.

1107
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:00,000
Some other podcasters in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com with some advice for people

1108
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
that are going to get screwed with the Skype changes.

1109
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:07,000
Rama says, use a USB mixer and audition for podcasting.

1110
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
Black Wolf says, I use two sound cards.

1111
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
So there's other ways to do it.

1112
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:14,000
Alrighty, let's move on with some more news.

1113
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,000
DarkSakura.

1114
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:22,000
Well, in other news, there is a day one patch for the PS4 that's 300 megabytes and it's

1115
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
adding some interesting things.

1116
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:35,000
It's going to add in the remote play, which means that the titles will be displayed on

1117
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:38,000
the TV and you can use the Vita to connect to them.

1118
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:41,000
The second screen, basically, the Vita.

1119
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:47,000
You can record, take screenshots, upload different videos that you've taken.

1120
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:51,000
You can watch other people play games.

1121
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,000
You need Twitch mode.

1122
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:55,000
You can play as you download.

1123
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
You have multiple logins up to four people.

1124
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:01,000
Voice chat, you have facial recognition and voice commands.

1125
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
This is if you have the camera.

1126
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:08,000
Background music player, online multiplayer and the Blu Ray and DVD player.

1127
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:11,000
So they're basically going, oops, all this stuff.

1128
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,000
Here you go.

1129
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:18,000
So, I mean, I see no reason to be upset about that, except that, you know, I mean, 300 megabytes

1130
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
isn't really that big.

1131
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
It's just basically saying, oh, we have this functionality.

1132
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,000
Now we're unlocking it.

1133
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,000
There you go.

1134
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,000
Have fun.

1135
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,000
Party.

1136
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,000
Literally.

1137
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
Because we have party mode.

1138
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
You can talk to your friends and call them assholes.

1139
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:35,000
The only thing I see a problem with it is just the whole Blu Ray DVD playback thing

1140
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,000
in there.

1141
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,000
That's my only thing.

1142
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:41,000
Because if you don't have any internet and you weren't ever planning on playing on the

1143
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:46,000
internet, all the other features like, you know, streaming video and doing all that stuff,

1144
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:51,000
you probably don't give a shit about because who cares if I can download a title and play

1145
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,000
part of the way.

1146
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:55,000
I don't have internet, so it doesn't matter to me.

1147
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:58,000
So that's the only thing that's kind of lame about that.

1148
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:04,000
But yeah, a lot of people nowadays have internet, so they could probably download it one way

1149
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,000
or another.

1150
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:11,000
As long as I think, as long as they support, like, being able to download that off of a

1151
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:14,000
storage device or something like that, so you can go to your friend's house, download

1152
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:18,000
it onto a USB stick and pop it into your PS4 or something like that, like you can right

1153
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:23,000
now with the PlayStation 3, then that might not be so bad if someone doesn't actually

1154
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:26,000
have internet, then they could just go somewhere else and get it.

1155
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:31,000
But, you know, if it's like the Xbox 360 or something, you know, usually you can't do that.

1156
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
You have to burn a disc or something.

1157
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:37,000
There is a part of me, sorry, Jamie, there is a part of me that wonders like, well, those

1158
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:40,000
poor people that are going to buy this system mostly for the Blu-ray playback are going

1159
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:43,000
to get screwed because, you know, they can't connect to the internet.

1160
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:46,000
But then I go, well, wait a minute, when those people just get a PlayStation 3 because they're

1161
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:50,000
still on the market and they're going to be cheaper, like these early adopters, I've got

1162
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
to be techie people in the first place, right?

1163
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,000
Yeah.

1164
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:58,000
I mean, I don't think this news is super bad or, you know, it's, unfortunately, it's not

1165
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:59,000
out of character at this day and age.

1166
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:03,000
And let's, you know, to be fair, at least the update's a lot smaller than the Wii U

1167
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,000
one, 300 megs.

1168
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:09,000
I mean, fuck, that's half the size of the DLC for, you know, Saints Row IV and you're

1169
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
getting way more replay value out of that.

1170
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:14,000
Not to even mention that there are cheaper Blu-ray players on a PS3 nowadays.

1171
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
That's very true.

1172
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:20,000
It's kind of funny, the direction that we're going soon, Geek Squad is going to start having

1173
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:27,000
console, console, console installation, professional services for, oh, your system doesn't turn

1174
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
on and plug in and press play.

1175
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
Now we have to get all this stuff set up upfront.

1176
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:32,000
Jason, I'm sure they already do that.

1177
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:36,000
Like if you were to ask them those types of questions at Best Buy, like, you know, how

1178
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:40,000
could I switch between my Xbox and my PlayStation or whatever, I'm sure Geek Squad will be happy

1179
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
to come out there and hook it all up for you.

1180
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:47,000
I always have to wave off that stupid $3 disc insurance thing whenever I buy a game.

1181
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:52,000
Or grandma, you know, I want to set up Netflix on the Wii for my kid and they literally don't

1182
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:56,000
know how to do it because, you know, I could see where there's a small market for that.

1183
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:59,000
Yeah, Ranma says they do that now.

1184
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:00,000
I had a feeling.

1185
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:03,000
But there's a few other things with this.

1186
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:08,000
One thing that will not be available at launch is the suspend resume mode that's supposed to

1187
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:12,000
basically use the low power state and take you back into your game, but they said there's

1188
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
more to come on that in the future.

1189
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:19,000
There's also a PlayStation app that's going to be out on November 13th in North America

1190
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:22,000
and the 22nd of November in Europe.

1191
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:27,000
Can we at least have it where when people are talking, especially companies are talking

1192
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:30,000
about features that they're going to have in their system, that they fucking come out with

1193
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:35,000
the goddamn system and say, yeah, we're going to have this really cool low power mode that's

1194
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:36,000
really awesome.

1195
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,000
Oh, fuck it.

1196
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,000
It's not coming out at launch.

1197
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:41,000
Oh, hey, we're going to have this Internet browser with this brand new up.

1198
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,000
No, fuck it.

1199
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,000
It's not going to be ready.

1200
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:49,000
You know, seriously, don't advertise features you're not going to fucking have day one.

1201
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:50,000
That's it.

1202
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,000
I mean, it's just like, hey, I bought this car.

1203
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:54,000
I heard all these great things about the wheels it has.

1204
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,000
Oh, fuck.

1205
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:56,000
It doesn't have wheels.

1206
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,000
Damn.

1207
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
No, we can't have that.

1208
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:03,000
And we will continue to not have that for the foreseeable decades.

1209
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:08,000
I, you know, without evolving on yet another tangent, this is one of those things that

1210
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:13,680
there's very much an argument to, um, the success of valve in the sense that they don't

1211
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:16,320
tout everything until it's there.

1212
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:18,680
Valve has not said a word about half-life three.

1213
01:03:18,680 --> 01:03:21,260
We know nothing of what half-life three will be.

1214
01:03:21,260 --> 01:03:25,680
If and when it finally gets here, it's, you know, there's no, there's no expectations

1215
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:28,680
other than it's gotta be better than the second game and there's a good chance that that's

1216
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:29,680
going to happen.

1217
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:31,760
Is valve a publicly traded company?

1218
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:35,340
That was going to be my second argument is that no valve is valve is not publicly held.

1219
01:03:35,340 --> 01:03:37,160
That's why valve can do what they're doing.

1220
01:03:37,160 --> 01:03:38,160
Yeah.

1221
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:39,160
That's, that's absolutely true.

1222
01:03:39,160 --> 01:03:43,200
If you don't, if you don't meet your investors' earnings, if you don't, you know, pump up

1223
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:47,680
your pump, uh, pump your ego in your product for investors, your stock goes down and takes

1224
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:49,680
everything else of your value with it.

1225
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:55,040
Um, it's all, it's, it's a really, really tangled web because at the same time, more

1226
01:03:55,040 --> 01:03:59,440
often than not company stocks sync during news announcements, or at least maybe the

1227
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:04,400
most popular ones like Amazon, Apple, and possibly also Microsoft.

1228
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:11,120
Um, but that's not an uncommon trend, which seems to say, why do we even bother going

1229
01:04:11,120 --> 01:04:16,400
through this media hype only to have bad news once we get to the end of it?

1230
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:19,400
All right.

1231
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:21,400
Well, is that it, Darsana, or do you have more?

1232
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:26,960
No, I actually had more to say about the app, but, um, yeah, I didn't get it out.

1233
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:27,960
It's tangenty tonight.

1234
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:28,960
Yeah, I know.

1235
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:33,800
Um, the app itself, what it's supposed to do is it lets you access the PlayStation network,

1236
01:04:34,320 --> 01:04:38,160
your friends list, your trophies, but it also has to act as a second screen for games that

1237
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:39,320
support it.

1238
01:04:39,320 --> 01:04:42,280
So I wanted to get that out.

1239
01:04:42,280 --> 01:04:43,280
Awesome.

1240
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:44,560
For people who don't know.

1241
01:04:44,560 --> 01:04:48,060
I just hope the servers don't all get hammered the first day and the damn thing takes forever

1242
01:04:48,060 --> 01:04:49,060
to download.

1243
01:04:49,060 --> 01:04:50,060
Like what happened on Wii U.

1244
01:04:50,060 --> 01:04:51,060
Are you being prophetic?

1245
01:04:51,060 --> 01:04:52,640
Well, just saying they will.

1246
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:53,640
I'm sure they will.

1247
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:54,640
You just jinxed them, Rob.

1248
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:55,640
Thank you.

1249
01:04:55,640 --> 01:04:56,640
Thanks, Rob.

1250
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:59,700
This is no, this is, this is like one of the first rules of the internet is this stuff

1251
01:04:59,700 --> 01:05:00,700
always happens.

1252
01:05:00,700 --> 01:05:01,700
Here you go.

1253
01:05:01,700 --> 01:05:02,700
Here you go.

1254
01:05:02,700 --> 01:05:03,700
Here's here.

1255
01:05:03,700 --> 01:05:06,260
If you catch now on their website, download it to the fucking thumb drive.

1256
01:05:06,260 --> 01:05:07,260
Thank you.

1257
01:05:07,260 --> 01:05:08,260
Thank you.

1258
01:05:08,260 --> 01:05:09,260
That would be a great idea.

1259
01:05:09,260 --> 01:05:10,260
Actually.

1260
01:05:10,260 --> 01:05:13,220
It's like, Hey, we know our servers are probably gonna get hammered at launch.

1261
01:05:13,220 --> 01:05:17,860
Hey, you want to take, you want to be a little bit, a bit torrent, put a bit torrent out

1262
01:05:17,860 --> 01:05:18,860
there.

1263
01:05:18,860 --> 01:05:25,020
Then they, then it won't even be on their servers, but I guess that's, yeah, I'm just

1264
01:05:25,020 --> 01:05:32,220
saying, I'm just, you, you could, that's a little too controversial for them, but then

1265
01:05:32,220 --> 01:05:36,180
hackers would tear that shit apart if they're going to tear it apart anyways, what are they

1266
01:05:36,180 --> 01:05:37,180
going to do with it?

1267
01:05:37,180 --> 01:05:41,180
It's just going to take them five minutes longer, figure out that much faster, how to

1268
01:05:41,180 --> 01:05:42,700
install Linux on it.

1269
01:05:42,700 --> 01:05:49,500
I guess they've already done it to the toaster, so don't get me started to register participation

1270
01:05:49,500 --> 01:05:52,580
for this week's episode of orange launch radio at vog network.com.

1271
01:05:52,580 --> 01:05:58,780
Use the passphrase saw, um, okay.

1272
01:05:58,780 --> 01:06:02,660
So a little bit more about the PlayStation for, um, there was some details coming out

1273
01:06:02,660 --> 01:06:07,580
about the digital games and some of the benefits you get with PlayStation plus, for example,

1274
01:06:07,580 --> 01:06:12,740
digital games, you can actually share your account with a couple, two consoles.

1275
01:06:12,740 --> 01:06:16,820
So you have one console that you deem your primary console that kind of operates the

1276
01:06:16,820 --> 01:06:21,620
way I see is similar to like, um, I think how your PlayStation three works right now,

1277
01:06:21,620 --> 01:06:26,760
where you download stuff to it and it will play with, you know, pretty much anybody that's

1278
01:06:26,760 --> 01:06:30,800
logged in will have access to that DLC or the game or whatever.

1279
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:37,040
Um, also, um, remote play will be available through the Vita and you'll be able to, I

1280
01:06:37,040 --> 01:06:41,240
guess, purchase and preorder content via the PlayStation app for that console and that

1281
01:06:41,240 --> 01:06:42,240
type of stuff.

1282
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:46,240
You can also, um, use two systems concurrently.

1283
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:52,360
So the system activated is your primary PS4 and one other system that you're logged into.

1284
01:06:52,360 --> 01:06:59,200
So that to me sounds like if I get grand theft out of five for the PlayStation four

1285
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:06,440
or something like that or whatever, and I have the digital download for like, you know,

1286
01:07:06,440 --> 01:07:11,680
I downloaded to my system and then I have a second PS4, my friend has a PS4 and I log

1287
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:18,080
into their system that I can play two players with the same game or is they only gonna allow

1288
01:07:18,080 --> 01:07:19,480
one person to play at a time?

1289
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:20,480
It doesn't really specify.

1290
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:25,400
I think it's very, that what the Xbox 360 does right now is almost the exact same rules,

1291
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:28,320
sort of locally, not across systems.

1292
01:07:28,320 --> 01:07:31,280
If everybody's in the same household, you can have those, those guests accounts, which

1293
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:34,580
are the same gamer tag with the one, two, three appended to it.

1294
01:07:34,580 --> 01:07:37,680
I think that's what you're thinking of, but certainly not across two consoles in different

1295
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:38,680
locations.

1296
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:42,040
No, it sounds like, well, I mean, it sounds similar to what I think.

1297
01:07:42,040 --> 01:07:44,880
Didn't you guys have to do something like that with Mass Effect or something where you'd

1298
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:49,600
play on one console and log in, you know, with the other person's thing.

1299
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:51,000
I don't know.

1300
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:56,720
They've kind of done this right now, I wanna say with, cause remember they used to have

1301
01:07:56,720 --> 01:08:02,640
it where you could authorize like a few accounts and the whole thing, or a few different systems

1302
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:09,640
to use your data, your DLC or whatever with, just because, you know, oh well, what if,

1303
01:08:09,640 --> 01:08:12,860
you know, my system crashes and I need a new system and I need to authorize it so they

1304
01:08:12,860 --> 01:08:13,860
have the file.

1305
01:08:13,860 --> 01:08:20,860
And you would have actually, um, people exploiting that to, okay, I buy a copy of a game and

1306
01:08:20,860 --> 01:08:22,740
I'm gonna share it with four of my friends.

1307
01:08:22,740 --> 01:08:28,140
So they started limiting that down to, I think now it's down to two and I think that's what

1308
01:08:28,140 --> 01:08:29,140
they have here.

1309
01:08:29,140 --> 01:08:32,180
So you could exploit that, but I don't think it's meant for that.

1310
01:08:32,180 --> 01:08:35,140
It's more of like, you know, I'm going to my friend's house or something.

1311
01:08:35,140 --> 01:08:36,140
Yeah.

1312
01:08:36,140 --> 01:08:38,280
It's more like you are going to go to your friends and play one game, but your little

1313
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:40,860
brother is still at home playing your PlayStation four.

1314
01:08:40,860 --> 01:08:43,140
Like it's more like that kind of situation, right?

1315
01:08:43,140 --> 01:08:44,140
I think so.

1316
01:08:44,140 --> 01:08:45,140
Two is pretty reasonable.

1317
01:08:45,140 --> 01:08:46,140
Yeah.

1318
01:08:46,140 --> 01:08:48,140
I think that's how it's supposed to be.

1319
01:08:48,140 --> 01:08:49,660
Uh, oh, here we go.

1320
01:08:49,660 --> 01:08:58,040
It says, uh, let's see, cause they have like an infographic for it and it says only, only

1321
01:08:58,040 --> 01:09:00,300
you can start games you download.

1322
01:09:00,300 --> 01:09:05,740
Only you can enjoy benefits from PlayStation plus and then, uh, systems that are not activated

1323
01:09:05,740 --> 01:09:06,860
as your primary.

1324
01:09:06,860 --> 01:09:10,620
And then, uh, that graphic is clear as bud.

1325
01:09:10,620 --> 01:09:11,620
Yeah.

1326
01:09:11,820 --> 01:09:14,140
I don't understand what the fuck they're talking about.

1327
01:09:14,140 --> 01:09:16,660
A system that is activated is primary.

1328
01:09:16,660 --> 01:09:19,980
Uh, yeah, you, you have, don't get it.

1329
01:09:19,980 --> 01:09:22,180
I think that's, yeah, I think I had it right.

1330
01:09:22,180 --> 01:09:23,180
You had it right.

1331
01:09:23,180 --> 01:09:27,260
You can, you with your account, with your PlayStation network account can download things

1332
01:09:27,260 --> 01:09:28,400
to the console.

1333
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:32,900
As soon as it's on the console, anybody else can take advantage of that locally.

1334
01:09:32,900 --> 01:09:36,100
Nobody else can start a download using your account.

1335
01:09:36,100 --> 01:09:38,300
It's it's, it's pretty expected.

1336
01:09:38,300 --> 01:09:44,660
Uh, some other random details that were, um, released, I guess that the PlayStation four

1337
01:09:44,660 --> 01:09:48,380
and Xbox one both support up to eight people in party chat.

1338
01:09:48,380 --> 01:09:49,380
Now here's my questions.

1339
01:09:49,380 --> 01:09:52,140
How many does the Xbox three 60 support now in party chat?

1340
01:09:52,140 --> 01:09:54,100
Because I think it's quite a few people.

1341
01:09:54,100 --> 01:09:55,100
I think eight.

1342
01:09:55,100 --> 01:09:56,100
You think six?

1343
01:09:56,100 --> 01:09:57,100
I thought it was only six.

1344
01:09:57,100 --> 01:10:02,320
I seem to remember it's a full game limited to four plus just two more could be wrong.

1345
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:06,940
It's been forever since I've used that because I don't know, because I know I've had a lot

1346
01:10:06,940 --> 01:10:10,640
of people in party chat before, but I don't remember.

1347
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:11,640
I haven't really counted.

1348
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:14,640
There's no, it worked.

1349
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:16,860
So it'd be interesting.

1350
01:10:16,860 --> 01:10:19,060
Hopefully it's the same or more, you know?

1351
01:10:19,060 --> 01:10:20,060
Um, yeah.

1352
01:10:20,060 --> 01:10:24,680
And he said, party voice chat will support eight players like on places where like from

1353
01:10:24,680 --> 01:10:28,620
support that xbox.com a party can contain up to eight people.

1354
01:10:28,620 --> 01:10:31,940
Once the maximum attendance is reached, someone must leave the party before another person

1355
01:10:31,940 --> 01:10:34,160
can join.

1356
01:10:34,160 --> 01:10:36,500
That's the GTFO our party right now.

1357
01:10:36,500 --> 01:10:39,380
We want someone cool.

1358
01:10:39,380 --> 01:10:40,540
Get out.

1359
01:10:40,540 --> 01:10:41,860
We have no cake for you.

1360
01:10:41,860 --> 01:10:47,020
I was gonna say like eight seems right because like, isn't like a Forza horizon match, like

1361
01:10:47,020 --> 01:10:51,140
eight people and like a lot of xbox live stuff is like eight people I think.

1362
01:10:51,140 --> 01:10:52,140
So anyway.

1363
01:10:52,140 --> 01:10:54,100
All right.

1364
01:10:54,100 --> 01:10:55,100
That's it.

1365
01:10:55,100 --> 01:10:56,100
All right.

1366
01:10:56,100 --> 01:11:01,860
Well, moving on to some more news, uh, news about a game called bravely default for the

1367
01:11:01,860 --> 01:11:02,860
sequel.

1368
01:11:02,860 --> 01:11:08,820
Uh, bravely default for the sequel is going to be coming out on the three D S and uh,

1369
01:11:08,820 --> 01:11:13,820
it's going to have a new system in it known as bravely second, uh, bravely default for

1370
01:11:13,820 --> 01:11:18,300
the sequel is kind of like a cutesy little like role playing ish type of game.

1371
01:11:18,300 --> 01:11:23,500
Um, bravely second will, uh, have, you know, time stopping antics, which, you know, we're

1372
01:11:23,500 --> 01:11:28,660
in the original game, uh, but it relies on what's called SP your special power.

1373
01:11:28,660 --> 01:11:31,940
Uh, once you use this power, your SP decreases.

1374
01:11:31,940 --> 01:11:36,780
You can gain SP when you put your three D S and sleep mode, but it's a little bit slow.

1375
01:11:36,780 --> 01:11:38,420
It's like regening Nana and ever quest.

1376
01:11:38,420 --> 01:11:39,780
It's very, very slow.

1377
01:11:39,780 --> 01:11:43,580
One SP point is added for every eight hours of idle time.

1378
01:11:43,580 --> 01:11:44,580
But guess what?

1379
01:11:44,580 --> 01:11:50,640
If you don't want to wait, you can buy potions on the three D S E shop that refill your SP.

1380
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:53,940
I've seen that model before on a Facebook game.

1381
01:11:53,940 --> 01:11:54,940
Yuck.

1382
01:11:54,940 --> 01:12:01,300
Well, we keep telling them they need to learn the internet, so we're better to turn to not

1383
01:12:01,300 --> 01:12:02,300
the place to do.

1384
01:12:02,300 --> 01:12:04,980
I don't think this is actually a Nintendo game.

1385
01:12:04,980 --> 01:12:12,020
However, um, we don't know, uh, producer Tomoya as Sano, uh, assures fans that this will be

1386
01:12:12,020 --> 01:12:13,020
a good thing.

1387
01:12:13,020 --> 01:12:14,020
Oh, of course.

1388
01:12:14,020 --> 01:12:19,060
Quote, bravely second, isn't a demerit, but a system that gives players an advantage.

1389
01:12:19,060 --> 01:12:21,340
It's convenient and it's very powerful.

1390
01:12:21,340 --> 01:12:24,480
So in other words, it's for people that want to cheat, I guess is what I'm reading in that.

1391
01:12:24,520 --> 01:12:27,960
And so if you want to like, you can buy cheats essentially.

1392
01:12:27,960 --> 01:12:30,400
This game is out in Japan in December.

1393
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:33,840
Um, I don't know if it's coming out here.

1394
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:38,280
I haven't heard anything about it.

1395
01:12:38,280 --> 01:12:42,920
I'm trying to see bravely default Western release includes updated for the sequel.

1396
01:12:42,920 --> 01:12:46,320
We had the, we had the first one.

1397
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:48,520
So bravery default.

1398
01:12:48,520 --> 01:12:52,160
I'm switching my internal clock to make it look like it's a day later.

1399
01:12:52,160 --> 01:12:53,840
Oh, look, there's all my energy back.

1400
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:54,840
Yeah.

1401
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:58,040
I wonder if people would be able to time travel and trick the trick, the thing that way.

1402
01:12:58,040 --> 01:13:01,280
Another article on the site says that it's going to be out in North America in 2014.

1403
01:13:01,280 --> 01:13:04,760
Oh, thank you.

1404
01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:05,760
I didn't play the first one.

1405
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:09,040
I gotta be honest, but I did hear about it and you know, some people seem to enjoy it.

1406
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:16,700
So I really hope that this is something that truly, not just cause the dude says it is

1407
01:13:16,700 --> 01:13:20,200
truly is not like has no impact on the game.

1408
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:24,340
If I were to not use it, like in other words, I could still beat the game start to finish

1409
01:13:24,340 --> 01:13:27,520
without too much hassle without even touching this stuff.

1410
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:30,000
Cause that would just be, that would just be shitty.

1411
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:31,620
I don't really have another word for it.

1412
01:13:31,620 --> 01:13:36,820
One point for every eight hours though, on any scale of any RPG I've ever played, that's,

1413
01:13:36,820 --> 01:13:38,800
that's ludicrously small.

1414
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:42,220
And like you would, you know, let, let's assume something's 15 points.

1415
01:13:42,220 --> 01:13:44,920
That's what, four days of idle before you recharge that.

1416
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:45,920
It's ridiculous.

1417
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:50,180
Shane's telling me we haven't had the first one, but I'm looking at it right here on Amazon

1418
01:13:50,180 --> 01:13:54,120
for sale or is this an import Japanese?

1419
01:13:54,120 --> 01:13:57,440
I got fooled has a really pretty art.

1420
01:13:57,440 --> 01:14:02,360
So you know, somebody that imported it and I guess so as if there's not plenty of people

1421
01:14:02,360 --> 01:14:07,400
around this table, that's ever done something like that for a game before 2d X.

1422
01:14:07,400 --> 01:14:08,400
All right.

1423
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:10,200
Uh, let's move on before we get to release date.

1424
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:11,200
Start Sakura.

1425
01:14:11,200 --> 01:14:15,280
Um, we have, uh, remember last week we talked about, was it last week?

1426
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:19,000
I think that, um, Nintendo wasn't going to be making Wii for Japan anymore.

1427
01:14:19,780 --> 01:14:20,780
This is Wii, not the Wii U.

1428
01:14:20,780 --> 01:14:24,100
Well, it's already been confirmed as well for Europe.

1429
01:14:24,100 --> 01:14:29,980
Um, they are going to be producing no more for the European markets and, um, Nintendo

1430
01:14:29,980 --> 01:14:36,220
of UK said that the consumers who don't own a Wii can still buy a Wii mini.

1431
01:14:36,220 --> 01:14:39,540
That's the lower price point that has a bunch of the stuff missing.

1432
01:14:39,540 --> 01:14:48,980
Um, it's all using a DLC, sorry, it's only disc based games and no deals, uh, no download

1433
01:14:48,980 --> 01:14:51,760
titles and no backwards compatibility.

1434
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:55,480
Um, but, uh, no word for the U S yet.

1435
01:14:55,480 --> 01:14:57,200
There was a second body type for the Wii.

1436
01:14:57,200 --> 01:14:59,160
Yeah, it was the Wii mini.

1437
01:14:59,160 --> 01:15:00,160
It was crap.

1438
01:15:00,160 --> 01:15:04,960
It, there is no internet connection cause it doesn't have a wifi, anything in it.

1439
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:07,480
There was no HD out on it.

1440
01:15:07,480 --> 01:15:12,360
Um, and it's funny cause it has all these channels and stuff on there, but you can't

1441
01:15:12,360 --> 01:15:14,600
really do anything with it because there's no internet.

1442
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:15,600
You can't download the virtual console stuff.

1443
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:18,320
Yeah, they shut off all the, a lot of the channels now.

1444
01:15:18,320 --> 01:15:19,320
Yeah.

1445
01:15:19,320 --> 01:15:20,320
Did that actually come out stateside?

1446
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:22,320
No GameCube backwards compatibility in Canada.

1447
01:15:22,320 --> 01:15:23,900
I don't know if the mini ever did, Canada.

1448
01:15:23,900 --> 01:15:27,420
Canada got the red one, of course, but, uh, I don't think it ever came out in the U S.

1449
01:15:27,420 --> 01:15:29,100
I missed all of this news.

1450
01:15:29,100 --> 01:15:30,100
It's just crap.

1451
01:15:30,100 --> 01:15:34,460
Just, I mean, seriously, if you're going to save money on a Wii, buy a used Wii.

1452
01:15:34,460 --> 01:15:39,020
It's you know, why bother wasting money on a brand new piece of shit that doesn't do

1453
01:15:39,020 --> 01:15:40,020
anything?

1454
01:15:40,020 --> 01:15:41,460
I don't know.

1455
01:15:41,460 --> 01:15:45,580
The Wii does have a huge game library though for people that, you know, might want to get

1456
01:15:45,580 --> 01:15:47,300
one for a younger person.

1457
01:15:47,300 --> 01:15:50,360
You know, entry level gaming console or whatever.

1458
01:15:50,360 --> 01:15:54,320
And really the Wii was only a good for me for one thing and that was, you know, weather

1459
01:15:54,320 --> 01:16:00,400
and we news and I can't do that anymore because the news channel doesn't work.

1460
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:04,280
I checked that every, no it's funny that you mentioned that because I kind of liked those

1461
01:16:04,280 --> 01:16:06,120
channels for a very long time.

1462
01:16:06,120 --> 01:16:10,480
There's always something wrong with the news channel and uh, yeah, I don't know.

1463
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:13,760
I found easier source, Oh no, I know what happened.

1464
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:19,740
I found an iPhone and then having to go back to a console on my TV was not exactly as important

1465
01:16:19,740 --> 01:16:20,740
or convenient anymore.

1466
01:16:20,740 --> 01:16:24,900
I just can't believe that I waited in line for that, except that I hung out with Kristen

1467
01:16:24,900 --> 01:16:27,100
the whole time and it was pretty fun and we got donuts.

1468
01:16:27,100 --> 01:16:32,460
It was alright in the beginning, I don't know, Excite Truck was awesome.

1469
01:16:32,460 --> 01:16:35,020
You're still mad about Excite Bots.

1470
01:16:35,020 --> 01:16:37,980
I am furious about Excite Bots.

1471
01:16:37,980 --> 01:16:43,260
Seriously, who in the, who on the face of the earth thought, hey let's put a mini game

1472
01:16:43,260 --> 01:16:46,080
in the middle of a fucking race and that's a great idea.

1473
01:16:46,080 --> 01:16:48,360
I don't want to punch them in the goddamn face.

1474
01:16:48,360 --> 01:16:52,020
Like for some reason it's become like a trend on Twitter lately to really hate on the Twilight

1475
01:16:52,020 --> 01:16:56,760
Princess as part of the Zelda series, but I mean that game was like the shit when it

1476
01:16:56,760 --> 01:16:58,960
first came out on the Nintendo Wii.

1477
01:16:58,960 --> 01:17:04,580
I mean just kind of what it, what it did and then I named my cat after and kind of like,

1478
01:17:04,580 --> 01:17:07,360
you know what that brought to the table for gaming in general.

1479
01:17:07,360 --> 01:17:12,020
Um, so I guess, you know, now if you go back and play it now, it's a little bit like, Oh,

1480
01:17:12,020 --> 01:17:16,040
this is very linear, but I mean it was great at the time.

1481
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:18,600
Yeah, the Wii, the Wii brought a lot of great games.

1482
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:19,600
Come on.

1483
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:20,600
All right, let's move on.

1484
01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:24,040
We've got to travel around the world and check out some release dates and what's coming out

1485
01:17:24,040 --> 01:17:25,960
near you soon.

1486
01:17:25,960 --> 01:17:27,500
Yes.

1487
01:17:27,500 --> 01:17:32,140
So this week, uh, actually a lot of games, but in no particular order here, Monster High

1488
01:17:32,140 --> 01:17:38,600
13 Wishes for girls on the Wii, Wii U, 3DS and DS.

1489
01:17:39,400 --> 01:17:45,620
They're also doing some collections of games, X-Com and Civ 5, the 2K definitive strategy

1490
01:17:45,620 --> 01:17:53,140
collection on PC, Sonic Lost World on 3DS and Wii U, Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures,

1491
01:17:53,140 --> 01:17:59,240
the game that sort of resembles some of the 3D Sonic games and based on some new animated

1492
01:17:59,240 --> 01:18:07,220
TV series, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii and Wii U and 3DS I believe.

1493
01:18:07,220 --> 01:18:12,340
The game stick is finally coming out and no one cared.

1494
01:18:12,340 --> 01:18:18,280
The 2K power pack collection with Darkness 2, I think it, actually that might be the

1495
01:18:18,280 --> 01:18:28,020
first Darkness, the Darkness Mafia 2 and Bioshock, I have to make sure here, I can't read this.

1496
01:18:28,020 --> 01:18:36,140
Oh, Bioshock 2 Darkness 2 and Mafia 2, those are coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

1497
01:18:36,140 --> 01:18:43,540
Battlefield 4 on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and PC this week.

1498
01:18:43,540 --> 01:18:51,580
Angry Birds Star Wars on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, Wii U, 3DS and Vita.

1499
01:18:51,580 --> 01:18:58,540
Beyblade Evolution on 3DS, Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360,

1500
01:18:58,540 --> 01:19:05,900
Wii U and actually no PC, that's coming out later because we can't get their release dates

1501
01:19:05,900 --> 01:19:08,220
coordinated for the PC versions.

1502
01:19:08,220 --> 01:19:13,940
WWE 2K14 on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

1503
01:19:13,940 --> 01:19:19,660
What else here?

1504
01:19:19,660 --> 01:19:25,540
Transformers Ultimate Battle Edition re-release there, also Ultimate Autobots Edition and

1505
01:19:25,540 --> 01:19:35,380
there's one last one here, more Angry Birds, Doodle Jump for 3DS.

1506
01:19:35,900 --> 01:19:41,340
Yeah, 3DS and DS, Doodle Jump.

1507
01:19:41,340 --> 01:19:51,620
And then, oh, also I think on Friday, I think that's the first, Wii Remote, they're gonna

1508
01:19:51,620 --> 01:19:58,540
have a Wii Remote Plus for Luigi and Mario, you know, cause that's cool and all.

1509
01:19:58,540 --> 01:20:05,000
I wanted to add, this is kind of funny, cause I don't know if they even talk next gen release

1510
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:12,000
dates yet, but Call of Duty Ghosts on all formats will be coming out on the 5th.

1511
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:17,320
That's right, you can get Call of Duty Ghosts two weeks before the system that comes out

1512
01:20:17,320 --> 01:20:20,040
to play it on the Xbox One.

1513
01:20:20,040 --> 01:20:21,240
Doesn't this happen all the time?

1514
01:20:21,240 --> 01:20:25,960
No, it happens a few days, like, you know, it comes out on Friday and it releases on...

1515
01:20:25,960 --> 01:20:28,720
So when the Wii U came out, all the games were on shelves earlier, I remember that.

1516
01:20:28,720 --> 01:20:34,120
Yeah, they were out like, you know, maybe a few days before the system came out, maybe

1517
01:20:34,120 --> 01:20:35,400
a week.

1518
01:20:35,400 --> 01:20:38,200
But this is like two weeks, this is fucking stupid.

1519
01:20:38,200 --> 01:20:39,200
I gotcha.

1520
01:20:39,200 --> 01:20:42,520
Alright, let's take a look at Japan and what's coming out in Japan.

1521
01:20:42,520 --> 01:20:45,760
They're getting their releases on Halloween the 31st.

1522
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:50,560
The FPS Pad 3 Strike Gear, I think that's actually an accessory, sorry that's not a

1523
01:20:50,560 --> 01:20:51,560
game.

1524
01:20:51,560 --> 01:20:56,040
But you can get a Mahjong game called Dankyu Battle 3, comes out this week on the Playstation

1525
01:20:56,040 --> 01:20:57,040
3.

1526
01:20:57,040 --> 01:21:02,520
Next to Tiara 2, Hau no Matsue comes out in a first print limited edition, if you're

1527
01:21:02,520 --> 01:21:03,620
so inclined.

1528
01:21:03,620 --> 01:21:08,400
And then Vampire Resurrection, just in time for Halloween, gets a price reduction.

1529
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:10,040
So there you go on the Playstation 3.

1530
01:21:10,040 --> 01:21:13,040
On the Xbox 360, there is really nothing this week.

1531
01:21:13,040 --> 01:21:19,640
You can get that same little FPS Pad thing I talked about before, that's really it.

1532
01:21:19,640 --> 01:21:23,120
On the Playstation Vita this week, Gundam Breaker!

1533
01:21:23,160 --> 01:21:27,640
And there is also a new Slim model, because I believe those Vita Slims, those just came

1534
01:21:27,640 --> 01:21:31,520
out in Japan like a couple weeks ago, or one of them, right?

1535
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:35,380
There's a Gundam Breaker Vita pack, if you're so inclined, so that's out.

1536
01:21:35,380 --> 01:21:42,720
Also Chuu Jiji-Gen GEMU Neptune Rebirth 1, in regular and limited edition, is out on

1537
01:21:42,720 --> 01:21:44,960
the Vita as well.

1538
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:50,360
On the Wii U this week, yes there is some Wii U stuff in Japan this week, Wii Party

1539
01:21:50,360 --> 01:21:52,960
U is one of the big games coming out.

1540
01:21:52,960 --> 01:22:00,280
And then there's some stuff that's centered around, it looks like Wii Fit U, but is that

1541
01:22:00,280 --> 01:22:02,080
available for download on the 31st?

1542
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:04,680
I don't remember how that whole thing was going down, like remember you could like download

1543
01:22:04,680 --> 01:22:05,680
it a month early or something?

1544
01:22:05,680 --> 01:22:09,520
Yeah, you're supposed to be able to download it a month early, and I know that next, not

1545
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:16,000
next week, but the week after next, those stupid Wii Fit sensor things are supposed

1546
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:17,000
to go on sale.

1547
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:21,200
Because in Japan, you've got the Fit Meter is out this week, and the Balance Board covers

1548
01:22:21,200 --> 01:22:26,640
are out this week, so I'm like, there's a lot of activity around Wii Fit coming out

1549
01:22:26,640 --> 01:22:27,640
this week.

1550
01:22:27,640 --> 01:22:32,200
In fact, it looks like there's actually a Wii U set that comes with Wii Fit U that they're

1551
01:22:32,200 --> 01:22:33,200
releasing in Japan.

1552
01:22:33,200 --> 01:22:34,200
I'm trying to bring this up right now.

1553
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:39,380
Oh yeah, looks like there's a new bundle in Japan that's 32 gigs, black Wii U, with Mario

1554
01:22:39,380 --> 01:22:45,920
Brothers U, Wii Party U, Wii Fit U, a Wii Mote, and the whole little like sensor bar

1555
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:52,400
thing, and it comes with one of the little portable, what are those called, the sensors?

1556
01:22:52,400 --> 01:22:57,220
They look like Tamagotchis, for God's sake, they're little Wii U Tamagotchis, but it's

1557
01:22:57,220 --> 01:22:58,220
you.

1558
01:22:58,220 --> 01:23:00,440
That's straight up the pocket station right there.

1559
01:23:00,440 --> 01:23:01,440
Right?

1560
01:23:01,440 --> 01:23:04,680
So they've got a hefty little bundle there in Japan out this week.

1561
01:23:04,680 --> 01:23:14,800
So alright, let's see, also moving on to the Nintendo 3DS, Dan Ball Senki Wars is out this

1562
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:23,000
week, and Chara Petsukute Sonatete, character Shogaku, comes out this week.

1563
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:28,960
And that's just cute little animals including a pink panda who has hearts for ears.

1564
01:23:28,960 --> 01:23:31,160
Aw, that's adorable.

1565
01:23:31,160 --> 01:23:32,160
That's it for Japanese releases.

1566
01:23:32,160 --> 01:23:33,920
How about the UK darts, Sakura?

1567
01:23:33,920 --> 01:23:42,080
In the UK, we have on the 29th of October, WWE K14, on the 31st, Football Manager 2014

1568
01:23:42,080 --> 01:23:49,080
for PC and Mac, and Tokitori, excuse me, on November 1st, there's Angry Birds Star

1569
01:23:49,080 --> 01:23:54,160
Wars for damn near everything, and Angry Birds Star Wars 2 for damn near every console, Assassin's

1570
01:23:54,160 --> 01:24:04,000
Creed 4 Black Flag, Battlefield 4, Blur Overdrive for iPad and iPhone, and Wii Fit U.

1571
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:07,160
That sounds kind of dirty.

1572
01:24:07,160 --> 01:24:09,000
I don't want to know about that anymore.

1573
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:10,000
I'm done.

1574
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:14,000
Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys, and then the classic game of the week,

1575
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:15,400
but first, Loki.

1576
01:24:15,400 --> 01:24:22,480
Alright, so there's going to be a brand new Mario themed, I guess, deluxe bundle that's

1577
01:24:22,480 --> 01:24:24,400
going to be coming out for the Wii U.

1578
01:24:24,400 --> 01:24:28,840
Instead of Nintendo landing in there, they're kind of updating the whole skew with now New

1579
01:24:28,840 --> 01:24:34,560
Super Mario Brothers U and the DLC New Luigi, or New Super Luigi U, so you'll be able to

1580
01:24:34,560 --> 01:24:43,600
get that for $2.99 this holiday, starting, I believe, at the end of next week, so it'll

1581
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:44,600
be pretty fast.

1582
01:24:44,600 --> 01:24:52,920
And then also, even though it is leaving shelves in a couple other regions, the Wii will still

1583
01:24:52,920 --> 01:25:00,720
be around in the US, and basically the announcement of the Wii console being discontinued is specific

1584
01:25:00,720 --> 01:25:03,320
to Japan, and well, now Europe.

1585
01:25:03,320 --> 01:25:07,300
There's no change of status in the Wii in the United States, and is available for purchase

1586
01:25:07,300 --> 01:25:08,920
this holiday season.

1587
01:25:08,920 --> 01:25:14,840
Of course, you know, gotta clear out those shelves, because they probably still stock

1588
01:25:14,840 --> 01:25:15,840
over here.

1589
01:25:15,840 --> 01:25:17,840
Yeah, that's right.

1590
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:23,680
Alright, in some other bundle related news, this is something that's happening in Japan,

1591
01:25:23,680 --> 01:25:28,800
but Metal Gear Rising will be getting like a Playstation 3 special edition.

1592
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:34,280
It's a DLC bundled Playstation 3 re-release that's going to come out later this year for

1593
01:25:34,280 --> 01:25:38,560
Metal Gear Rising, and it's the Re-Vengeance special edition.

1594
01:25:38,560 --> 01:25:45,340
It will have Blade Wolf and Jetstream DLC packs, 30 VR missions, 5 alternate costumes,

1595
01:25:45,340 --> 01:25:48,480
and a custom Playstation 3 theme.

1596
01:25:48,480 --> 01:25:53,680
You can check all that out on December 5th, and it's also going to be available as a download

1597
01:25:53,680 --> 01:25:57,220
on Playstation Network, as most of the game releases are.

1598
01:25:57,220 --> 01:25:59,280
Don't know yet if this is coming out stateside.

1599
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:02,240
This is only confirmed for Japan as of right now.

1600
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:04,260
Speaking of Playstation, I have another quick story.

1601
01:26:04,260 --> 01:26:09,460
This is about a whole little Playstation bundle.

1602
01:26:09,460 --> 01:26:10,460
This is interesting.

1603
01:26:10,460 --> 01:26:15,900
A Gran Turismo 6 bundle that's going to come out in Brazil.

1604
01:26:15,900 --> 01:26:20,340
It's an, I'm going to mispronounce this name, and I apologize because he passed away in

1605
01:26:20,340 --> 01:26:23,460
1994, but he was a very famous racer.

1606
01:26:23,460 --> 01:26:28,380
Ayrton Senna, I hope I didn't mispronounce that, I apologize if I did, but he's going

1607
01:26:28,380 --> 01:26:33,700
to be featured as part of this Gran Turismo 6 bundle that's coming out, and it's supposed

1608
01:26:33,700 --> 01:26:36,900
to actually kind of like help charity, which is pretty cool.

1609
01:26:36,900 --> 01:26:41,900
I'm assuming that part of the proceeds of the bundle actually go to the institute set

1610
01:26:41,900 --> 01:26:45,980
up in this guy's name that helps to educate, so that's pretty cool.

1611
01:26:45,980 --> 01:26:46,980
This is on December 6th.

1612
01:26:46,980 --> 01:26:48,940
This is coming out in Brazil.

1613
01:26:48,940 --> 01:26:55,180
Comes out with Gran Turismo 6, a 250 gigabyte Playstation 3, and one controller.

1614
01:26:55,180 --> 01:26:58,340
So that's very cool.

1615
01:26:58,340 --> 01:27:01,180
One other reason I bring this up is that, I don't know if you guys saw, but apparently

1616
01:27:01,180 --> 01:27:04,340
the Playstation 4 is going to cost oodles and oodles of money in Brazil.

1617
01:27:04,340 --> 01:27:05,980
Did you hear about that?

1618
01:27:05,980 --> 01:27:06,980
It's something like...

1619
01:27:06,980 --> 01:27:08,220
It kind of doesn't surprise me though.

1620
01:27:08,220 --> 01:27:09,700
Yeah, everything costs more over there.

1621
01:27:09,700 --> 01:27:14,940
Yeah, I know, but it's like on the scale of like $1500 or something like that when you

1622
01:27:14,940 --> 01:27:16,500
convert the money.

1623
01:27:16,500 --> 01:27:22,660
It's a really high price, so I bet there will be people that just somehow get one from the

1624
01:27:22,660 --> 01:27:25,780
US or another place and import them for way less.

1625
01:27:25,780 --> 01:27:28,540
But it's taxes is what the thing is.

1626
01:27:28,540 --> 01:27:31,500
Taxes that really affect the prices, not that they're marketing it up.

1627
01:27:31,500 --> 01:27:33,500
People will get them illegally.

1628
01:27:33,500 --> 01:27:39,900
Alright, let's travel back to a time when Gran Turismo 5 wasn't even out.

1629
01:27:39,900 --> 01:27:42,580
Heck, I don't even think the original Gran Turismo was out.

1630
01:27:42,940 --> 01:27:46,780
In fact, some people would still agree that Gran Turismo 5 is not out yet.

1631
01:27:46,780 --> 01:27:48,660
That's the joke I was trying to make unsuccessfully.

1632
01:27:48,660 --> 01:27:52,820
But it's time for Dark Sakura to step into the gaming vault and find a game that she

1633
01:27:52,820 --> 01:27:57,300
thinks, hey, you should like play this now and stuff.

1634
01:27:57,300 --> 01:27:58,420
You're going to roll your eyes.

1635
01:27:58,420 --> 01:28:00,780
I'm totally going to roll my eyes at this week's...

1636
01:28:00,780 --> 01:28:04,220
But I did it for you and I did it for Shane.

1637
01:28:04,220 --> 01:28:05,220
Don't do anything for Shane.

1638
01:28:05,220 --> 01:28:06,220
That was the first mistake.

1639
01:28:06,220 --> 01:28:08,740
I am doing something for Shane so that he will help me level.

1640
01:28:08,740 --> 01:28:10,140
You're only making him stronger.

1641
01:28:10,140 --> 01:28:11,140
That's right.

1642
01:28:11,140 --> 01:28:13,060
Shane is horrible power stronger.

1643
01:28:13,060 --> 01:28:14,940
Shane, don't listen to them.

1644
01:28:14,940 --> 01:28:16,940
You have good taste in music.

1645
01:28:16,940 --> 01:28:20,500
Alright, Dark Sakura, what is the classic game of the week?

1646
01:28:20,500 --> 01:28:23,700
It's Pokemon Red and Blue.

1647
01:28:23,700 --> 01:28:24,700
Don't laugh.

1648
01:28:24,700 --> 01:28:25,700
These aren't classic.

1649
01:28:25,700 --> 01:28:26,700
Don't judge me.

1650
01:28:26,700 --> 01:28:29,340
You're totally judging me right now.

1651
01:28:29,340 --> 01:28:31,460
Maybe a little bit.

1652
01:28:31,460 --> 01:28:40,440
Anyway, so anyway, this was developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo for the Game

1653
01:28:40,440 --> 01:28:44,960
Boy and this came out in 1996.

1654
01:28:44,960 --> 01:28:50,680
Actually in Japan they came out as Red and Green and Blue was released as a special edition.

1655
01:28:50,680 --> 01:28:54,400
Then they were released as Red and Blue in North America, Europe and Australia over the

1656
01:28:54,400 --> 01:28:55,400
next three years.

1657
01:28:55,400 --> 01:29:01,400
Pokemon Yellow is a special version that was basically like, hi, here's Pikachu.

1658
01:29:01,400 --> 01:29:08,040
Both have been remade, by the way, as Pokemon FireRed and LeafGreen that came out in 2004.

1659
01:29:08,040 --> 01:29:13,280
So basically, overhead perspective, you go through the fictional area of Kanto and you

1660
01:29:13,280 --> 01:29:17,080
basically abuse your poor little animals and make Pita cry.

1661
01:29:17,080 --> 01:29:20,200
I'm kidding because that was a fake.

1662
01:29:20,200 --> 01:29:26,680
But you basically pit your animals against each other and see who is the greatest.

1663
01:29:26,680 --> 01:29:32,980
Of course, you know, I love how in Japan the game was more marketed as with the adventure

1664
01:29:32,980 --> 01:29:33,980
and everything.

1665
01:29:33,980 --> 01:29:37,320
And yeah, the collection thing was a part of it, but it's like blatant commercialism

1666
01:29:37,320 --> 01:29:38,320
out here.

1667
01:29:38,320 --> 01:29:39,320
Gotta catch them all!

1668
01:29:39,320 --> 01:29:40,320
Like rabies or something.

1669
01:29:40,320 --> 01:29:41,320
I don't know.

1670
01:29:41,320 --> 01:29:46,000
So anyway, you have to fight the different gym leaders and you collect badges and you

1671
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:50,320
beat the game like a bat.

1672
01:29:50,320 --> 01:29:56,560
So, other things about this game is that you have a little thing in there called the Pokedex.

1673
01:29:56,560 --> 01:30:02,560
And basically for the first game you had 150 available Pokemon and you could keep track

1674
01:30:02,560 --> 01:30:07,960
of all of them that you catch in your Pokedex and you still had to deal with Team Rocket.

1675
01:30:07,960 --> 01:30:12,600
You could also use your game link cable to connect your games together and let you trade

1676
01:30:12,600 --> 01:30:16,040
and battle between games, which my husband and I did quite a bit.

1677
01:30:16,040 --> 01:30:19,840
I believe Dan played Red and I played Blue.

1678
01:30:19,840 --> 01:30:28,200
Then there was the 151st Pokemon Mew that you could only get through official distribution

1679
01:30:28,200 --> 01:30:35,400
by Nintendo or by a glitch and I won't say anything about getting it that way cause I

1680
01:30:35,400 --> 01:30:36,400
got it.

1681
01:30:36,400 --> 01:30:38,680
And Nintendo please come to your house right now.

1682
01:30:38,680 --> 01:30:42,440
Whatever, they're a little late.

1683
01:30:42,440 --> 01:30:48,240
So yeah, basically IGN ranked it as one of the top 100 games of all time.

1684
01:30:48,240 --> 01:30:52,300
And in 2009 it was in the Guinness Book of World Records as best selling RPG on Game

1685
01:30:52,300 --> 01:30:55,520
Boy and best selling RPG on Time.

1686
01:30:55,600 --> 01:31:01,080
So basically you have the third person overhead view but when you're in your battles it switches

1687
01:31:01,080 --> 01:31:07,040
to a behind the back of your whatever Pokemon that you're playing and you can train them

1688
01:31:07,040 --> 01:31:08,040
out.

1689
01:31:08,040 --> 01:31:09,040
You have up to six.

1690
01:31:09,040 --> 01:31:14,380
You cannot teach, you know, Pokemon who would, who have wings, you have to teach them how

1691
01:31:14,380 --> 01:31:15,380
to fly.

1692
01:31:15,380 --> 01:31:17,420
I mean, really, what's up with that?

1693
01:31:17,420 --> 01:31:20,600
You get experience, you level them up.

1694
01:31:20,600 --> 01:31:27,840
You also can get some of the most useless piece of crap Pokemon ever like Magikarp.

1695
01:31:27,840 --> 01:31:34,000
But Magikarp turns into Gyarados and I have gone through the entire game with Gyarados

1696
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:35,400
and I haven't eaten anything else.

1697
01:31:35,400 --> 01:31:40,840
The first time I got, did that whole wonder trade on Pokemon X and Y, somebody sent me

1698
01:31:40,840 --> 01:31:41,840
a fucking Magikarp.

1699
01:31:41,840 --> 01:31:46,040
But of course it was Japanese Magikarp so that made it a little cooler.

1700
01:31:46,040 --> 01:31:47,040
Mmhmm.

1701
01:31:47,040 --> 01:31:48,040
Oh Rob.

1702
01:31:48,480 --> 01:31:55,320
Anyway, as far as other elements in the game, you do also have the capturing aspect, gotta

1703
01:31:55,320 --> 01:32:01,560
catch them all, where you can find Pokemon in the wild and you can put them into a life

1704
01:32:01,560 --> 01:32:05,320
of eternal servitude living in little balls for the rest of their existence.

1705
01:32:05,320 --> 01:32:07,560
They're like little animal genies.

1706
01:32:07,560 --> 01:32:08,560
Little animal genies.

1707
01:32:08,560 --> 01:32:11,240
They come out and do cage fighting for you.

1708
01:32:11,240 --> 01:32:12,240
Yeah.

1709
01:32:12,640 --> 01:32:19,120
And to also say something about something that was mentioned in the last game, Pikachu

1710
01:32:19,120 --> 01:32:20,860
is the breed, not it's name.

1711
01:32:20,860 --> 01:32:23,560
It's like calling your dog, dog.

1712
01:32:23,560 --> 01:32:25,440
Calling your cat, cat.

1713
01:32:25,440 --> 01:32:28,360
I had a cat named Mr. Cat, that was a little bit more respectful.

1714
01:32:28,360 --> 01:32:30,840
It'd be like saying Pikachu son.

1715
01:32:30,840 --> 01:32:34,640
So anyway, there have been other versions, of course.

1716
01:32:34,640 --> 01:32:39,440
There were Gold, Silver, and Crystal, that was a second generation.

1717
01:32:39,440 --> 01:32:43,800
And using the transfer pack on Nintendo 64, you could actually use items from your Red

1718
01:32:43,800 --> 01:32:47,640
and Blue in Pokemon Stadium and Pokemon Stadium 2.

1719
01:32:47,640 --> 01:32:51,840
However, they were not compatible with the advanced generation.

1720
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:57,240
Which I actually had Pokemon Stadium, but I kind of didn't play it much.

1721
01:32:57,240 --> 01:33:00,240
Really the best part about Pokemon Stadium was like, just watching your Pokemon come

1722
01:33:00,240 --> 01:33:03,240
out and do their little poses and then it got boring.

1723
01:33:03,240 --> 01:33:06,280
I love seeing through.

1724
01:33:06,280 --> 01:33:09,320
Anyway, I'm looking over the shoulder.

1725
01:33:09,320 --> 01:33:13,360
So the setting of the game takes place in Kanto.

1726
01:33:13,360 --> 01:33:19,880
And it's got different habitats for the different Pokemon, different towns and cities, and roots

1727
01:33:19,880 --> 01:33:22,280
that connect them all to each other.

1728
01:33:22,280 --> 01:33:26,560
And you can get some of them only by fishing.

1729
01:33:26,560 --> 01:33:29,760
You can get stuff like the Zubat only in the cave.

1730
01:33:29,760 --> 01:33:38,160
So you're sent out by Professor Oak, who lets you pick one and then you are in a rivalry

1731
01:33:38,160 --> 01:33:40,640
with Oak's grandson.

1732
01:33:40,640 --> 01:33:45,080
And what was his name, Gary?

1733
01:33:45,080 --> 01:33:49,080
Because I remember the character in Japan was actually named after Miyamoto, his name

1734
01:33:49,080 --> 01:33:51,120
was Shigeru.

1735
01:33:51,120 --> 01:33:58,280
So there's also a rumor that we were supposed to get a version of, that there had been an

1736
01:33:58,280 --> 01:34:03,880
intention to do a version of Green that had a female trainer.

1737
01:34:03,880 --> 01:34:06,720
But that's still on the rumor mill.

1738
01:34:06,720 --> 01:34:10,960
Anyway, you can start off with Bulbasaur, Squirtle, or Charmander.

1739
01:34:10,960 --> 01:34:13,680
And yeah, my first game playthrough is Bulbasaur.

1740
01:34:13,680 --> 01:34:17,320
Every other time I've ever, you know, I switched to red and was like Charmander all the way

1741
01:34:17,320 --> 01:34:19,440
because I didn't care.

1742
01:34:19,440 --> 01:34:22,200
But my first playthrough was with Bulbasaur.

1743
01:34:22,200 --> 01:34:29,000
And basically you eventually have to fight the Elite Four and the new champion who is

1744
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:30,480
boom, your rival.

1745
01:34:30,480 --> 01:34:32,080
So you have to kick their ass.

1746
01:34:32,080 --> 01:34:37,600
So the whole concept of Pokemon started, and I don't know how many people know about this,

1747
01:34:37,600 --> 01:34:44,280
that the designer Satoshi Tajiri was an insect collector.

1748
01:34:44,280 --> 01:34:52,040
And so basically he wanted to give that same feeling of discovery, of capture, of collection

1749
01:34:52,040 --> 01:34:58,400
like that, of live specimens into a game that people could play at any time.

1750
01:34:58,400 --> 01:35:02,160
You wouldn't necessarily have to live out in the country for it.

1751
01:35:02,160 --> 01:35:06,520
He was noticing that kids played more in their homes instead of outside.

1752
01:35:06,520 --> 01:35:11,920
So he wanted to sort of give people the feeling of being able to grow up in the outside environment.

1753
01:35:11,920 --> 01:35:16,320
And like I said, that sense of discovery.

1754
01:35:16,320 --> 01:35:21,360
He also did not want to make games that had more, as he said, pointless violence, even

1755
01:35:21,360 --> 01:35:24,000
though he's having animals fight each other.

1756
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:29,760
So basically, that was the other one I was trying to remember, is that the character

1757
01:35:29,760 --> 01:35:33,360
that you play at is named Satoshi after himself.

1758
01:35:33,360 --> 01:35:36,480
And of course his rival is Shikaru after Miyamoto.

1759
01:35:36,480 --> 01:35:47,960
So there's so much more about this, a lot of history that went into the production of

1760
01:35:47,960 --> 01:35:52,440
the game.

1761
01:35:52,440 --> 01:36:00,680
They even made some different audio advancements by using different sounds in the processor

1762
01:36:00,680 --> 01:36:07,520
to create a snare sound using basically a white noise filter in the Game Boy, creating

1763
01:36:07,520 --> 01:36:15,400
the animal sounds by using, the Pokemon sounds by using the, basically making it a very short

1764
01:36:15,400 --> 01:36:16,400
chiptune.

1765
01:36:16,400 --> 01:36:22,000
It was supposed to be originally called Capsule Monster, but there was a trademark issue,

1766
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:27,360
they were going to call it Capamon, and basically they went to Pocket Monster, so it's Pokemon.

1767
01:36:27,360 --> 01:36:34,760
And it was basically rejected over and over by Nintendo until Miyamoto came out with the

1768
01:36:34,760 --> 01:36:36,400
golden way of making it work.

1769
01:36:36,400 --> 01:36:38,320
So that's why we have it.

1770
01:36:38,320 --> 01:36:44,800
So that's, I'm not going to go into a lot more of the detail, because really there is

1771
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:53,440
a whole hell of a lot about this game, but if you haven't played the original, I think

1772
01:36:53,440 --> 01:36:54,440
you're kind of missing out.

1773
01:36:54,440 --> 01:36:58,760
Even if you're not a big fan of Pokemon at all today, if you don't care about the new

1774
01:36:58,760 --> 01:37:04,400
ones, I think that if anyone wants a good rounded off classic gaming background, Pokemon

1775
01:37:04,400 --> 01:37:05,520
should be in it.

1776
01:37:05,520 --> 01:37:07,560
So that's my final word.

1777
01:37:07,560 --> 01:37:10,920
Alright there it is, your classic game of the week, or games of the week, Pokemon Red

1778
01:37:10,920 --> 01:37:11,920
and Pokemon Blue.

1779
01:37:11,920 --> 01:37:14,200
And you can add yellow into it because it was the same gen.

1780
01:37:14,200 --> 01:37:18,440
I was going to say, my first Pokemon game was yellow, so it was the same gen.

1781
01:37:18,440 --> 01:37:24,520
I got the see-through off-purple Game Boy color and Pokemon Yellow.

1782
01:37:24,520 --> 01:37:28,840
Yeah, it was because of the damn anime that I loved Pokemon.

1783
01:37:28,840 --> 01:37:33,240
You know, I had the Japanese theme song memorized for years, and I actually have, you know how

1784
01:37:33,240 --> 01:37:37,200
you used to buy singles in those square cases with the little tiny disc inside?

1785
01:37:37,200 --> 01:37:39,960
I actually have the Nyasu sings.

1786
01:37:39,960 --> 01:37:40,960
Nice.

1787
01:37:40,960 --> 01:37:42,760
Nyasu is Meowth.

1788
01:37:42,760 --> 01:37:45,720
So it also has the full Team Rocket song on it.

1789
01:37:45,720 --> 01:37:51,280
I squeed in the new Pokemon X and Y when wild Pikachus were showing up in the second zone

1790
01:37:51,280 --> 01:37:52,280
you're in.

1791
01:37:52,280 --> 01:37:55,540
I was like, yes, that's the Pokemon I want to capture, you know, that's the right call.

1792
01:37:55,540 --> 01:38:00,120
And also, just to say, one of Shermie's nicknames was Caterpie.

1793
01:38:00,120 --> 01:38:01,120
Just saying.

1794
01:38:01,120 --> 01:38:04,200
It is pretty crazy to think that the games Red and Blue predated the anime.

1795
01:38:04,200 --> 01:38:05,200
Yeah, I know, right?

1796
01:38:05,200 --> 01:38:06,200
At least in Japan.

1797
01:38:06,200 --> 01:38:07,520
I don't remember about America.

1798
01:38:07,520 --> 01:38:12,720
I think that the games, I think that it was more of a simultaneous thing over here.

1799
01:38:12,720 --> 01:38:13,720
Yeah, it was more of a simultaneous thing.

1800
01:38:13,720 --> 01:38:15,160
Because the anime had already been out forever.

1801
01:38:15,160 --> 01:38:18,840
And for the record, the Porygon episode totally did not make me have a seizure.

1802
01:38:18,840 --> 01:38:19,840
Just saying.

1803
01:38:19,840 --> 01:38:22,760
All right, we're going to take a quick break, guys.

1804
01:38:22,760 --> 01:38:26,680
When we come back, there's plenty more OLR to come, including rapid fire news, more emails.

1805
01:38:26,680 --> 01:38:28,360
I know we had one at the top of the show.

1806
01:38:28,360 --> 01:38:29,360
We got more to come.

1807
01:38:29,360 --> 01:38:31,240
Fugu question of the week and plenty, plenty more.

1808
01:38:31,240 --> 01:38:32,240
Your calls as well.

1809
01:38:32,240 --> 01:38:33,240
1-877-GAME-OLR.

1810
01:38:33,240 --> 01:38:37,180
We'll be back, though, after a quick break with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1811
01:38:37,180 --> 01:38:43,720
Don't go anywhere.

1812
01:38:43,720 --> 01:38:47,120
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

1813
01:38:47,120 --> 01:38:51,380
Live on this Sunday night with episode number 525 of our show.

1814
01:38:51,380 --> 01:38:52,380
That's a palindrome.

1815
01:38:52,380 --> 01:38:53,900
And it's a multiple of 25.

1816
01:38:53,900 --> 01:38:56,500
So therefore, it's an event episode tonight.

1817
01:38:56,500 --> 01:38:57,500
Woohoo!

1818
01:38:57,500 --> 01:39:02,820
Well, it's always an event when the awesome Jason is here with us, as he can't join us

1819
01:39:02,820 --> 01:39:03,820
all the time.

1820
01:39:03,820 --> 01:39:09,260
Just in a while, he's in San Francisco for work and drives up the road to come say hi.

1821
01:39:09,260 --> 01:39:11,940
Because 22 hours to San Francisco in the first place wasn't enough.

1822
01:39:11,940 --> 01:39:14,260
Had to do the extra two hours up to Sacramento.

1823
01:39:14,260 --> 01:39:16,980
Do you wave the first time through?

1824
01:39:16,980 --> 01:39:24,180
I was thinking of making a surprise stop in here because I was ... I don't remember if

1825
01:39:24,180 --> 01:39:28,300
I was in Sacramento city limits or at least around the downtown area when the show started

1826
01:39:28,300 --> 01:39:29,900
or if it was just after.

1827
01:39:29,900 --> 01:39:33,400
And I probably should have, considering that I proceeded to take about four hours because

1828
01:39:33,400 --> 01:39:39,040
of the traffic in just South Sacramento, plus the traffic in Berkeley, plus the traffic

1829
01:39:39,040 --> 01:39:40,040
in downtown.

1830
01:39:40,040 --> 01:39:41,920
You drove in during the BART strike.

1831
01:39:41,920 --> 01:39:42,920
Congrats.

1832
01:39:42,920 --> 01:39:43,920
Yeah.

1833
01:39:43,920 --> 01:39:47,640
Yeah, that was not a very nice end to two days' worth of driving.

1834
01:39:47,640 --> 01:39:48,640
I bet.

1835
01:39:48,640 --> 01:39:49,640
Oh my gosh.

1836
01:39:49,640 --> 01:39:51,880
So you drove here all the way from Colorado where you live.

1837
01:39:51,880 --> 01:39:55,880
So do you drive nonstop and go over and sleep or where do you stop?

1838
01:39:55,880 --> 01:39:59,580
I could do it because it's about 20, 21 hours.

1839
01:39:59,580 --> 01:40:04,500
In this case, I left just before noon on Saturday.

1840
01:40:04,500 --> 01:40:08,140
Drove out to Nevada, stayed in Elko, Nevada.

1841
01:40:08,140 --> 01:40:10,140
Very tall, very small town.

1842
01:40:10,140 --> 01:40:11,940
About central Nevada.

1843
01:40:11,940 --> 01:40:13,540
And then continued the rest of the way.

1844
01:40:13,540 --> 01:40:18,660
The next day I pulled into the parking lot, nine o'clock local, I think.

1845
01:40:18,660 --> 01:40:19,660
Yeah.

1846
01:40:19,660 --> 01:40:21,940
I was going to say, you have to account for all that traffic.

1847
01:40:21,940 --> 01:40:24,120
So much of it too.

1848
01:40:24,120 --> 01:40:28,160
It would have been much more, much funner and more glorious to at least spend part A

1849
01:40:28,160 --> 01:40:29,160
down here.

1850
01:40:29,160 --> 01:40:30,160
But, oh well.

1851
01:40:30,160 --> 01:40:31,160
Whatever.

1852
01:40:31,160 --> 01:40:32,160
All right.

1853
01:40:32,160 --> 01:40:34,680
Well, let's get back into some gaming news, you guys.

1854
01:40:34,680 --> 01:40:38,480
Jason's with us to talk about whatever he wants with the gaming news and say his opinion.

1855
01:40:38,480 --> 01:40:40,520
Then you guys can share your opinions as well.

1856
01:40:40,520 --> 01:40:44,440
You can either do that live with us tonight, live.vognetwork.com if you're listening to

1857
01:40:44,440 --> 01:40:45,440
us on this Sunday night.

1858
01:40:45,440 --> 01:40:48,960
Or, of course, if you're listening to us on the podcast, you can always tweet at us at

1859
01:40:48,960 --> 01:40:49,960
OLR.

1860
01:40:49,960 --> 01:40:53,840
Or you can email us, mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com.

1861
01:40:53,840 --> 01:40:57,320
Let's check out some rapid fire news and quickly talk about a few things here.

1862
01:40:57,320 --> 01:40:58,320
Okay.

1863
01:40:58,320 --> 01:40:59,320
Yes.

1864
01:40:59,320 --> 01:41:04,480
So, since there really hasn't been too much going on with Minecraft on the Xbox 360 as

1865
01:41:04,480 --> 01:41:12,100
far as updates go, they have been putting out some skin packs to reskin the whole look

1866
01:41:12,100 --> 01:41:16,600
of Minecraft and sometimes include free levels and stuff.

1867
01:41:16,600 --> 01:41:19,120
They have another one coming out though for Halloween.

1868
01:41:19,120 --> 01:41:26,160
It kind of reskins everything, makes another nice and green and everything very Halloween-y.

1869
01:41:26,160 --> 01:41:28,000
And the price of that?

1870
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:29,000
Free.

1871
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:30,880
So, I think you can afford that.

1872
01:41:30,880 --> 01:41:33,240
So, go check it out if you haven't yet.

1873
01:41:33,240 --> 01:41:37,760
And also, creepers are nice and ghostly white now.

1874
01:41:37,760 --> 01:41:39,680
So, that's kind of fun.

1875
01:41:39,680 --> 01:41:41,800
And the Slenderman's about.

1876
01:41:41,800 --> 01:41:43,200
Ah, yes.

1877
01:41:43,200 --> 01:41:48,840
I'm assuming that they've redone the Enderman then to make him look like the Slenderman.

1878
01:41:48,840 --> 01:41:51,040
Very clever, I guess.

1879
01:41:51,040 --> 01:41:52,840
All right.

1880
01:41:52,840 --> 01:41:58,640
And then, on top of that, Grand Theft Auto, since I love talking about Grand Theft Auto.

1881
01:41:58,640 --> 01:41:59,920
Few things going on there.

1882
01:41:59,920 --> 01:42:01,680
There's some updates in November.

1883
01:42:01,680 --> 01:42:06,400
Some of the stuff that they were originally going to put out at launch for online, it's

1884
01:42:06,400 --> 01:42:10,560
been kind of delayed a little bit, including the stimulus package that's not coming out

1885
01:42:10,560 --> 01:42:17,600
now, which was supposed to have been last week, the first quarter million dollar payment.

1886
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:21,480
It's going to be next week, I think, or maybe even beyond that.

1887
01:42:21,520 --> 01:42:23,720
The Beach Bum pack is something that they're going to put out.

1888
01:42:23,720 --> 01:42:27,760
It's the first piece of DLC that's going to be free, and it's going to add some weapons

1889
01:42:27,760 --> 01:42:34,680
and vehicles to the game, as well as clothing items, and that's both online and single player.

1890
01:42:34,680 --> 01:42:40,080
And then also, of course, the content creator for a deathmatch and races is going to be

1891
01:42:40,080 --> 01:42:42,760
available as well in November.

1892
01:42:42,760 --> 01:42:47,800
And so, you'll be able to create your own deathmatches and deathmatch arenas and races

1893
01:42:47,840 --> 01:42:54,040
in the game, which I think is going to be pretty awesome when we get to do that.

1894
01:42:54,040 --> 01:42:59,760
And last but not least, it's been leaked out that there is a new kind of zombie mode in

1895
01:42:59,760 --> 01:43:05,920
the game of Call of Duty Ghosts, except now, instead of zombies, it's extinction, and extinction

1896
01:43:05,920 --> 01:43:11,120
has to do with aliens, so you're fighting off aliens instead of zombies.

1897
01:43:11,120 --> 01:43:15,520
And they're going to have the different type of stuff to go along with that as well.

1898
01:43:15,520 --> 01:43:18,760
So, interesting.

1899
01:43:18,760 --> 01:43:26,040
I guess we'll learn more about that pretty soon, since the game comes out in two weeks.

1900
01:43:26,040 --> 01:43:31,280
Or you can always get your PlayStation 4 one early and just look at the box and think about

1901
01:43:31,280 --> 01:43:32,280
that alien mode, right?

1902
01:43:32,280 --> 01:43:34,000
Yeah, or the Xbox One.

1903
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,160
You have extra time to contemplate that alien mode.

1904
01:43:36,160 --> 01:43:37,160
That's right.

1905
01:43:37,160 --> 01:43:39,720
You just sit there and think about it.

1906
01:43:39,720 --> 01:43:42,480
Killer Instinct, some more news coming out about that.

1907
01:43:42,480 --> 01:43:46,080
In fact, I've seen some footage coming out of those Xbox One preview events of Killer

1908
01:43:46,080 --> 01:43:47,080
Instinct.

1909
01:43:47,080 --> 01:43:52,960
It looks nice, but I got to admit, I'm not super duper excited about it.

1910
01:43:52,960 --> 01:43:57,440
I was hoping I'd be more excited about a new Killer Instinct, but whatever.

1911
01:43:57,440 --> 01:44:02,640
Don't let little old me get you in a bad mood about Killer Instinct, because there are some

1912
01:44:02,640 --> 01:44:07,440
neat things with this, including a training mode that is going to be available in the

1913
01:44:07,440 --> 01:44:08,440
game.

1914
01:44:08,440 --> 01:44:12,200
Killer Instinct does have a training mode, and there's some detailed information, again,

1915
01:44:12,200 --> 01:44:14,720
coming out of the preview events there.

1916
01:44:14,720 --> 01:44:19,960
Apparently, the highest difficulty level in the game, when you're in training mode, you

1917
01:44:19,960 --> 01:44:24,000
can do very easy, of course, and hard and so forth, but the most difficult level is

1918
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,640
something called Kyle.

1919
01:44:26,640 --> 01:44:31,000
It's apparently named on one of the development team's AI designers, who is insanely good

1920
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:32,000
at the game.

1921
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:36,160
So you can fight Kyle, who I guess works there and is really, really good at Killer Instinct.

1922
01:44:36,160 --> 01:44:37,160
I hate you, Kyle.

1923
01:44:37,160 --> 01:44:39,160
I hate you, Kyle.

1924
01:44:39,160 --> 01:44:42,040
I like that one.

1925
01:44:42,080 --> 01:44:45,840
The training dummy can also do combo breakers against you, and so forth.

1926
01:44:45,840 --> 01:44:49,360
So just different ways to kind of learn and play the game.

1927
01:44:49,360 --> 01:44:52,480
More detailed information floating around out there on the internet.

1928
01:44:52,480 --> 01:44:54,720
We talked earlier about Wii U Virtual Console.

1929
01:44:54,720 --> 01:44:57,840
We were kind of joking about Virtual Console releases, and I mentioned that the past few

1930
01:44:57,840 --> 01:45:02,400
haven't been very good, but the good news is you got a great one this week.

1931
01:45:02,400 --> 01:45:09,600
On Halloween, nonetheless, Super Castlevania IV is the Wii U release on Virtual Console

1932
01:45:09,600 --> 01:45:11,600
this week on Halloween.

1933
01:45:11,640 --> 01:45:13,760
Now, I already had that when it was on the Wii.

1934
01:45:13,760 --> 01:45:15,600
Speaking of games, I have in the box.

1935
01:45:15,600 --> 01:45:16,600
That's right.

1936
01:45:16,600 --> 01:45:19,480
So I can get this for a dollar if I want to get the Wii U Virtual Console version, which

1937
01:45:19,480 --> 01:45:20,480
I probably will.

1938
01:45:20,480 --> 01:45:21,480
You can come to my house and play it.

1939
01:45:21,480 --> 01:45:22,480
I can, but...

1940
01:45:22,480 --> 01:45:23,480
Dude, that would be awesome.

1941
01:45:23,480 --> 01:45:25,400
A Castlevania festival on Halloween.

1942
01:45:25,400 --> 01:45:26,400
But I can't...

1943
01:45:26,400 --> 01:45:30,960
See, what I can do in my house that I can't do at your house is play Castlevania IV on

1944
01:45:30,960 --> 01:45:31,960
the toilet.

1945
01:45:31,960 --> 01:45:33,680
I almost said it in the toilet.

1946
01:45:33,680 --> 01:45:34,680
On the toilet.

1947
01:45:34,680 --> 01:45:38,360
Technically, I have a way to do this.

1948
01:45:38,360 --> 01:45:40,400
I have extension cords and very small TVs.

1949
01:45:40,440 --> 01:45:43,200
I guess I really shouldn't challenge you, should I?

1950
01:45:43,200 --> 01:45:44,200
Alright.

1951
01:45:44,200 --> 01:45:46,200
I'll think of a way.

1952
01:45:46,200 --> 01:45:48,400
Remember, 90% of what I have done?

1953
01:45:48,400 --> 01:45:49,400
Motivated by spite.

1954
01:45:49,400 --> 01:45:50,400
Yes.

1955
01:45:50,400 --> 01:45:51,400
And porn.

1956
01:45:51,400 --> 01:45:57,640
Anyhow, that was one of, obviously, the best Super Nintendo games and best games in the

1957
01:45:57,640 --> 01:45:59,400
Castlevania series.

1958
01:45:59,400 --> 01:46:03,240
Not my absolute favorite in the Castlevania series, but for some people, it is their favorite.

1959
01:46:03,240 --> 01:46:05,240
And I will say this, killer soundtrack.

1960
01:46:05,240 --> 01:46:06,240
Some of the best.

1961
01:46:06,240 --> 01:46:07,240
Oh, yeah.

1962
01:46:07,240 --> 01:46:09,760
But, you know, in my esteem, nothing beats Dracula X.

1963
01:46:10,120 --> 01:46:11,120
Symphony of the Night.

1964
01:46:11,120 --> 01:46:13,440
I know it's cliche, but damn it.

1965
01:46:13,440 --> 01:46:14,600
So freaking good.

1966
01:46:14,600 --> 01:46:20,800
I would say of the traditional Castlevania games, Dracula X.

1967
01:46:20,800 --> 01:46:23,160
Dracula X is more like a bridge between those styles.

1968
01:46:23,160 --> 01:46:29,040
I still have a soft spot for Simon's Quest, which I think is the earliest kind of Metroidvania

1969
01:46:29,040 --> 01:46:30,040
style game.

1970
01:46:30,040 --> 01:46:31,040
What a terrible night for a curse.

1971
01:46:31,040 --> 01:46:32,040
Anyway.

1972
01:46:32,040 --> 01:46:34,420
But we're digressing again.

1973
01:46:34,420 --> 01:46:42,700
How about some rumors about other Mario universe characters that could possibly be playable

1974
01:46:42,700 --> 01:46:45,100
in Super Mario 3D World?

1975
01:46:45,100 --> 01:46:49,700
There's some speculation out there because of stamp collecting that occurs in Super Mario

1976
01:46:49,700 --> 01:46:50,880
3D World.

1977
01:46:50,880 --> 01:46:56,440
There's some icons that have been spotted where, hmm, this kind of looks like Rosalina,

1978
01:46:56,440 --> 01:47:00,380
who you might remember from Super Mario Galaxy.

1979
01:47:00,380 --> 01:47:05,420
So anyhow, there's some other stamps in the game that apparently feature her there, so

1980
01:47:05,420 --> 01:47:11,220
it's a little interesting that she's so featured in a game she's not supposed to be in.

1981
01:47:11,220 --> 01:47:14,500
So there could be some other characters actually playable in the game.

1982
01:47:14,500 --> 01:47:15,500
We don't know yet.

1983
01:47:15,500 --> 01:47:18,980
This is all totally off speculation, but of course, if you didn't already know, Super

1984
01:47:18,980 --> 01:47:25,740
Mario 3D World is going to already have Luigi, Mario, Princess, and Toad in the style of

1985
01:47:25,740 --> 01:47:28,980
their appearance in Super Mario 2, where Princess floats.

1986
01:47:28,980 --> 01:47:31,260
Luigi has flappy legs, and all that stuff.

1987
01:47:31,260 --> 01:47:33,060
You mean Doki Doki Panic the ROM hack?

1988
01:47:33,060 --> 01:47:34,060
Well, same thing.

1989
01:47:34,060 --> 01:47:36,420
It was a little more than a ROM hack, though.

1990
01:47:36,420 --> 01:47:40,340
I know, I stole that from Game Sack, but it was probably the best name for it I've ever

1991
01:47:40,340 --> 01:47:41,340
heard.

1992
01:47:41,340 --> 01:47:44,900
So that'd be pretty cool if there were some additional little hidden characters that they

1993
01:47:44,900 --> 01:47:45,900
add into it.

1994
01:47:45,900 --> 01:47:48,180
It'd be very interesting what they could do with that.

1995
01:47:48,180 --> 01:47:50,300
I'm just looking forward to Cat Mario myself.

1996
01:47:50,300 --> 01:47:52,700
Dark Soccer, what do you have for us?

1997
01:47:52,700 --> 01:47:53,700
As stuff.

1998
01:47:53,700 --> 01:47:54,700
And things?

1999
01:47:54,700 --> 01:47:55,700
No, just stuff.

2000
01:47:56,260 --> 01:48:00,460
I have a site that won't load, so I'm skipping it.

2001
01:48:00,460 --> 01:48:05,140
And this is the very important news that everyone's been waiting for.

2002
01:48:05,140 --> 01:48:08,660
How to avoid Pokemon X and Y's game breaking bug.

2003
01:48:08,660 --> 01:48:13,620
First of all, you can download the patch, which is out.

2004
01:48:13,620 --> 01:48:20,180
The patch is out there on the 3BS eShop, and you just go there, update, blah blah blah,

2005
01:48:20,180 --> 01:48:21,180
you're done.

2006
01:48:21,180 --> 01:48:24,780
However, other ways around...

2007
01:48:24,780 --> 01:48:25,780
Did we finally breed?

2008
01:48:25,780 --> 01:48:27,660
I'm literally opening up the eShop right now.

2009
01:48:27,660 --> 01:48:28,660
I was like, oh shit, she's got a point.

2010
01:48:28,660 --> 01:48:31,340
I thought you were checking to see if we, um, if our machines...

2011
01:48:31,340 --> 01:48:34,260
No, our DS's do not want to mate today for some reason.

2012
01:48:34,260 --> 01:48:36,460
Here, I'll move you over there.

2013
01:48:36,460 --> 01:48:37,460
Very rude.

2014
01:48:37,460 --> 01:48:39,260
I even had mine hump yours, okay?

2015
01:48:39,260 --> 01:48:40,260
No.

2016
01:48:40,260 --> 01:48:41,260
Um...

2017
01:48:41,260 --> 01:48:42,260
Oh my.

2018
01:48:42,260 --> 01:48:43,260
Scandal.

2019
01:48:43,260 --> 01:48:50,660
Anyway, um, so the, um, other way that you could do that is that, like I said, Nintendo

2020
01:48:50,660 --> 01:48:55,660
had put out a map that showed where the bug could occur, and so it gave you areas that

2021
01:48:55,660 --> 01:48:58,860
you could save your game in and avoid the bug.

2022
01:48:58,860 --> 01:49:05,220
But now, um, with the, um, the fix that's come out, it also should correct any broken

2023
01:49:05,220 --> 01:49:06,500
game saves.

2024
01:49:06,500 --> 01:49:11,760
So wherever you saved, if you happen to have experienced this bug, if you haven't deleted

2025
01:49:11,760 --> 01:49:15,540
your save file, then, um, you should be fine.

2026
01:49:15,540 --> 01:49:16,540
It will be restored.

2027
01:49:16,540 --> 01:49:19,300
Just go to your eShop and download it.

2028
01:49:19,300 --> 01:49:26,580
In other news, um, oh god, I was just talking about Rival Schools a moment ago, too, um,

2029
01:49:26,580 --> 01:49:33,900
there is a, uh, some talk from, um, Hideaki Tsuno, um, who, uh, wants to create a Rival

2030
01:49:33,900 --> 01:49:39,300
Schools 3, and Rival Schools is probably, like, my all-time favorite number one fighting

2031
01:49:39,300 --> 01:49:41,500
game series ever in the world universe.

2032
01:49:41,500 --> 01:49:42,500
I love it.

2033
01:49:42,500 --> 01:49:46,700
I mean, I even like it better than all the Tekkens combined, and I really like me some

2034
01:49:46,700 --> 01:49:47,700
Tekken.

2035
01:49:47,700 --> 01:49:52,180
So, um, he was the past director of the Rival Schools series, and he did, um, recently did

2036
01:49:52,180 --> 01:49:59,540
Dragon's Dogma, and, um, he basically, you know, what was, uh, said about it is that

2037
01:49:59,540 --> 01:50:05,860
it was, it captured authentic fighting, um, as he said, basically, uh, Street Fighter

2038
01:50:05,860 --> 01:50:08,540
2 was his, um, inspiration.

2039
01:50:08,540 --> 01:50:13,940
So during an interview, he said, and this is with the Anime News Network, um, he said

2040
01:50:13,940 --> 01:50:19,460
that he was real, he would really like to make, um, any Rival Schools title, which honestly,

2041
01:50:19,460 --> 01:50:21,460
do it.

2042
01:50:21,460 --> 01:50:22,460
No hesitation.

2043
01:50:22,460 --> 01:50:23,460
Do it.

2044
01:50:23,460 --> 01:50:24,460
Bring back all the characters.

2045
01:50:24,460 --> 01:50:25,460
Put in some more.

2046
01:50:25,460 --> 01:50:28,140
You know, we haven't had all the sports, you know, done.

2047
01:50:28,140 --> 01:50:30,140
We need, we could have more hooligans.

2048
01:50:30,140 --> 01:50:31,140
Yeah.

2049
01:50:31,140 --> 01:50:32,140
We could, we could have more.

2050
01:50:32,140 --> 01:50:34,980
I was talking about this before the show with Rob, and I was saying that I really, really

2051
01:50:34,980 --> 01:50:36,860
miss Rival Schools Disc 2.

2052
01:50:36,860 --> 01:50:39,220
All of those minigames were incredibly fun.

2053
01:50:39,220 --> 01:50:43,420
Or, you know, you've had Sakura in the game now for two versions of it.

2054
01:50:43,420 --> 01:50:48,060
I mean, she was a hidden character in the first one, and officially in, um, well, you

2055
01:50:48,060 --> 01:50:52,420
know, I have the Evolution Disc that had, like, the dancing game and the dating sim

2056
01:50:52,420 --> 01:50:53,720
and all that in it.

2057
01:50:53,720 --> 01:50:58,380
I paid a hundred bucks for that sucker when I had money, and it's freaking awesome.

2058
01:50:58,380 --> 01:51:02,620
I'll have to, I'll have to show you some stuff on it, but, like, I got, like, Batsu asked

2059
01:51:02,620 --> 01:51:09,920
my character out, and it was all cool and cute, um, but, uh, there were, um, that's

2060
01:51:09,920 --> 01:51:16,640
the game that introduced the Taicho, the, the class president, and, uh, the photographer,

2061
01:51:16,640 --> 01:51:22,800
and, uh, dude who swims, why can't I remember his name, but, um, that's the game that introduced

2062
01:51:22,800 --> 01:51:25,320
a lot of those characters that were in Rival Schools 2, and then Rival Schools 2 brought

2063
01:51:25,320 --> 01:51:29,600
out my favorite of all time, Zaki, um, but, I mean, just think about it.

2064
01:51:29,600 --> 01:51:32,120
It's about time.

2065
01:51:32,120 --> 01:51:33,120
Why not?

2066
01:51:33,120 --> 01:51:36,560
Yeah, and I'm actually, now I'm done filling time for the story that wouldn't load.

2067
01:51:36,560 --> 01:51:37,560
Alright.

2068
01:51:38,200 --> 01:51:40,280
I can finish one off on that note.

2069
01:51:40,280 --> 01:51:45,600
My, you know, convinced, conventional popular still going fighting games I love, but either

2070
01:51:45,600 --> 01:51:50,760
Rival, Rival Schools or Bloody Roar are probably my two favorites from that era.

2071
01:51:50,760 --> 01:51:52,800
Bloody Roar was an interesting game.

2072
01:51:52,800 --> 01:51:53,800
It's very interesting.

2073
01:51:53,800 --> 01:51:57,080
Didn't they actually remake that in, like, the last couple years?

2074
01:51:57,080 --> 01:51:58,080
No.

2075
01:51:58,080 --> 01:51:59,080
I don't recall.

2076
01:51:59,080 --> 01:52:00,080
I'm just crazy.

2077
01:52:00,080 --> 01:52:04,920
You may be thinking of, uh, Beast Riser with the, I don't know why they call it Beast Riser.

2078
01:52:04,920 --> 01:52:09,080
That's just such a dumb name for it, but I think that's what they came out, I think

2079
01:52:09,080 --> 01:52:12,360
that was the Japanese name for it, because it had an arcade version of it.

2080
01:52:12,360 --> 01:52:15,800
My ad's a rip-off of Bloody Roar, and it's the same damn name.

2081
01:52:15,800 --> 01:52:21,960
At least it wasn't brutal Paul's a Fury, because that was kind of crap.

2082
01:52:21,960 --> 01:52:25,560
Alright, uh, before we get to the face, or the Fugu question of the week, we skipped

2083
01:52:25,560 --> 01:52:26,560
the story.

2084
01:52:26,560 --> 01:52:27,560
Yeah, I was like, did you need me to do that?

2085
01:52:27,560 --> 01:52:28,560
Because it wouldn't load on her iPad, right?

2086
01:52:28,560 --> 01:52:33,480
Yeah, it wouldn't load at all, which, basically anything that I ever get from that site won't

2087
01:52:33,480 --> 01:52:34,480
load.

2088
01:52:35,040 --> 01:52:36,040
Well, here we go.

2089
01:52:36,040 --> 01:52:39,440
Uh, this is important because it was in the intro, so we have to cover it.

2090
01:52:39,440 --> 01:52:40,440
Sorry, sorry.

2091
01:52:40,440 --> 01:52:41,440
No, that's fine.

2092
01:52:41,440 --> 01:52:46,520
It has been found, the ToeJam and Earl 3, Mission to Earth.

2093
01:52:46,520 --> 01:52:47,520
That's right.

2094
01:52:47,520 --> 01:52:51,700
Sega apparently made that for the Xbox, of course, but did you know that there was another

2095
01:52:51,700 --> 01:52:56,720
ToeJam and Earl 3 at one point that was being made for the Dreamcast?

2096
01:52:56,720 --> 01:53:01,760
Some footage is now online, and apparently the owner of the disc wants to have a fundraiser

2097
01:53:01,760 --> 01:53:03,120
to get the code online.

2098
01:53:03,760 --> 01:53:07,760
Now, it is unfinished, it was not a finished game, so the project was never completed,

2099
01:53:07,760 --> 01:53:09,840
but this would be the missing ToeJam and Earl game.

2100
01:53:09,840 --> 01:53:13,680
So it is not ToeJam and Earl Xbox, but it's ToeJam and Earl 3 Dreamcast.

2101
01:53:13,680 --> 01:53:18,080
Why not just do a Kickstarter to finish the game?

2102
01:53:18,080 --> 01:53:21,320
That would be pretty cool, but I imagine all these developers are in different, I mean,

2103
01:53:21,320 --> 01:53:22,320
this is coded what?

2104
01:53:22,320 --> 01:53:23,320
This would have been like 15 years ago.

2105
01:53:23,320 --> 01:53:24,920
Yeah, but how much of the code was done?

2106
01:53:24,920 --> 01:53:29,360
Well, I mean, we can see some gameplay here if I kind of start it up here and fast forward

2107
01:53:29,360 --> 01:53:30,520
just a little bit in the video.

2108
01:53:30,560 --> 01:53:33,240
ToeJam and Earl 3 back from the dead.

2109
01:53:33,240 --> 01:53:35,440
Yeah, they're pretty good.

2110
01:53:35,440 --> 01:53:38,360
I mean, definitely the usual Dreamcast pop-in, but...

2111
01:53:38,360 --> 01:53:39,360
Yeah.

2112
01:53:39,360 --> 01:53:41,360
Ahh, crazy cheerleader.

2113
01:53:41,360 --> 01:53:50,400
Um, so, uh, but I mean, depending on how much of it is done, if the assets are there, then

2114
01:53:50,400 --> 01:53:55,040
I would think it used to be a matter of finishing the maybe level layouts and that type of thing.

2115
01:53:55,040 --> 01:53:56,400
This sounds like a call for an actor.

2116
01:53:56,400 --> 01:53:57,400
Star gladiator!

2117
01:53:57,400 --> 01:54:00,480
Oh my god, IkumaJP, I love you forever, because Star Gladiator was awesome.

2118
01:54:01,440 --> 01:54:03,840
All right, now we can do the FUGL question of the week, yes?

2119
01:54:03,840 --> 01:54:04,840
I guess.

2120
01:54:04,840 --> 01:54:05,840
I guess.

2121
01:54:05,840 --> 01:54:09,240
All right, Dark Soccer is going to per-miss it at some point here, so here we go.

2122
01:54:09,240 --> 01:54:10,880
You take Facebook, you take Google Plus.

2123
01:54:10,880 --> 01:54:11,880
Per-miss.

2124
01:54:11,880 --> 01:54:13,800
Slam those words to give permission.

2125
01:54:13,800 --> 01:54:14,800
Per-mit.

2126
01:54:14,800 --> 01:54:15,800
Per-whatever.

2127
01:54:15,800 --> 01:54:19,800
It's ready to go home.

2128
01:54:23,800 --> 01:54:28,840
Facebook and Google Plus, slam them together and you get FUGL Plus, or we just call it

2129
01:54:28,840 --> 01:54:29,840
FUGL.

2130
01:54:30,200 --> 01:54:33,280
I'm going to read some of the answers here, and we had a lot of answers, you guys, over

2131
01:54:33,280 --> 01:54:34,600
on Facebook and Google Plus.

2132
01:54:34,600 --> 01:54:35,600
I can't read them all.

2133
01:54:35,600 --> 01:54:36,600
There is not enough time.

2134
01:54:36,600 --> 01:54:38,600
I'm going to read some of these, though.

2135
01:54:38,600 --> 01:54:44,200
And the question we asked this week, what is the scariest moment you've ever experienced

2136
01:54:44,200 --> 01:54:45,200
in a video game?

2137
01:54:45,200 --> 01:54:46,400
I mean, Halloween's next week, right?

2138
01:54:46,400 --> 01:54:49,000
So why not ask a question about scary games?

2139
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:50,000
In spirit.

2140
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:53,040
How about when I thought Aerith was going to come back to life?

2141
01:54:53,040 --> 01:54:54,040
That's a good answer.

2142
01:54:54,040 --> 01:54:55,040
There you go.

2143
01:54:55,040 --> 01:54:56,040
Okay.

2144
01:54:56,040 --> 01:55:01,120
Or mine would be in probably when I was playing Silent Hill 4, The Room, and I literally screamed

2145
01:55:01,120 --> 01:55:04,600
out loud and one of those baby face monsters came running at me and Loki was like, what

2146
01:55:04,600 --> 01:55:05,600
the hell are you doing?

2147
01:55:05,600 --> 01:55:06,600
It's back when we lived together.

2148
01:55:06,600 --> 01:55:09,480
You know, the only thing that creeped me out in that game was the giant head.

2149
01:55:09,480 --> 01:55:10,480
Oh, yeah.

2150
01:55:10,480 --> 01:55:11,480
And not me.

2151
01:55:11,480 --> 01:55:12,480
To just watch you.

2152
01:55:12,480 --> 01:55:13,480
All right.

2153
01:55:13,480 --> 01:55:14,480
Anyhow.

2154
01:55:14,480 --> 01:55:15,480
Well, let's see what the listeners have to say, Darzara.

2155
01:55:15,480 --> 01:55:19,520
Starting us off on Facebook, Gemit says, anything Slender Man or Outlast?

2156
01:55:19,520 --> 01:55:22,280
I can't believe I'm opening myself for Rob to razz.

2157
01:55:22,280 --> 01:55:26,920
Luckily, I already did that earlier in the show, and Gemit just joined chat, so he probably

2158
01:55:26,920 --> 01:55:27,920
missed it.

2159
01:55:27,920 --> 01:55:31,520
For the record, I officially look at it the same.

2160
01:55:31,520 --> 01:55:32,520
Did he?

2161
01:55:32,520 --> 01:55:33,520
What did he do?

2162
01:55:33,520 --> 01:55:35,200
Did he help you with something on Final Fantasy?

2163
01:55:35,200 --> 01:55:37,120
No, for admitting that you would razz.

2164
01:55:37,120 --> 01:55:38,400
Oh, this is true.

2165
01:55:38,400 --> 01:55:40,400
And being better than that.

2166
01:55:40,400 --> 01:55:41,400
Very true.

2167
01:55:41,400 --> 01:55:42,400
Let's see.

2168
01:55:42,400 --> 01:55:43,960
Going to some other answers.

2169
01:55:43,960 --> 01:55:49,040
Dead Rising says, after gathering like 30,000 pp and then trying to run to a save point

2170
01:55:49,040 --> 01:55:51,480
while killing zombies on my last health bar.

2171
01:55:51,480 --> 01:55:52,480
Scary.

2172
01:55:52,480 --> 01:55:56,920
I think that was Mike saying the game Dead Rising, because the 30,000 points.

2173
01:55:56,920 --> 01:55:57,920
Oh.

2174
01:55:57,920 --> 01:56:00,800
See, when somebody writes...

2175
01:56:00,800 --> 01:56:01,800
Thank you.

2176
01:56:01,800 --> 01:56:05,080
When they write their name like that, I'm like, is that what you want us to call you?

2177
01:56:05,080 --> 01:56:06,080
Okay.

2178
01:56:06,080 --> 01:56:07,640
He's definitely talking about Dead Rising the game.

2179
01:56:07,640 --> 01:56:09,520
I can say that with 100% certainty.

2180
01:56:09,520 --> 01:56:10,520
There you go.

2181
01:56:10,520 --> 01:56:11,520
It does involve zombies.

2182
01:56:11,520 --> 01:56:12,960
Let's see.

2183
01:56:12,960 --> 01:56:13,960
Some more answers here.

2184
01:56:13,960 --> 01:56:17,560
Scott W says, it always comes back to the dog crashing through the window in Resident

2185
01:56:17,560 --> 01:56:18,560
Evil.

2186
01:56:19,080 --> 01:56:20,080
Oh, my God.

2187
01:56:20,080 --> 01:56:21,080
I remember that.

2188
01:56:21,080 --> 01:56:22,080
It was so scary.

2189
01:56:22,080 --> 01:56:25,760
Strudels89 says, playing The Last of Us in the Dark with my husband.

2190
01:56:25,760 --> 01:56:29,860
Walking around a corner, thinking we're safe, then having two clickers jump out and rip

2191
01:56:29,860 --> 01:56:30,920
Joel's throat out.

2192
01:56:30,920 --> 01:56:34,400
I screamed so loud and threw my controller on the bed.

2193
01:56:34,400 --> 01:56:38,840
Catfury05 says, the first time I saw Pyramid Head in Silent Hill 2.

2194
01:56:38,840 --> 01:56:40,200
Still scares me to this day.

2195
01:56:40,200 --> 01:56:43,360
That was pretty creepy.

2196
01:56:43,360 --> 01:56:45,560
Mary B says, Fatal Frame.

2197
01:56:45,560 --> 01:56:48,960
We were in our apartment in the dark, having played for a couple hours.

2198
01:56:48,960 --> 01:56:51,520
As Pat said, they never attack on the stairs.

2199
01:56:51,520 --> 01:56:55,120
He was promptly attacked from above by one of those ghastly creatures, and I let out

2200
01:56:55,120 --> 01:56:56,920
a blood curdling scream.

2201
01:56:56,920 --> 01:57:00,980
Game controller was thrown, lights turned on, and we were done for the night.

2202
01:57:00,980 --> 01:57:05,200
That and all of Fatal Frame's freaking celerity ghosts.

2203
01:57:05,200 --> 01:57:06,200
Is that Mary Moo?

2204
01:57:06,200 --> 01:57:07,200
Yes, it is.

2205
01:57:07,200 --> 01:57:08,280
Oh, I love Mary.

2206
01:57:08,280 --> 01:57:10,320
That is your friend, Mary.

2207
01:57:10,320 --> 01:57:11,320
Let's see.

2208
01:57:11,320 --> 01:57:15,800
Ray responds and says, still being a kid and playing Friday the 13th on the NES.

2209
01:57:15,800 --> 01:57:17,800
That game was so bad.

2210
01:57:17,800 --> 01:57:19,280
No, that game was underrated.

2211
01:57:19,280 --> 01:57:20,280
It was good.

2212
01:57:20,280 --> 01:57:21,280
It was awful.

2213
01:57:21,280 --> 01:57:23,820
It was good for what it was.

2214
01:57:23,820 --> 01:57:25,360
There were better games, yes.

2215
01:57:25,360 --> 01:57:27,200
The Friday the 13th game was worse.

2216
01:57:27,200 --> 01:57:28,200
Alright.

2217
01:57:28,200 --> 01:57:30,600
Not Friday the 13th, the Nightmare on the Street game.

2218
01:57:30,600 --> 01:57:31,600
The blah blah.

2219
01:57:31,600 --> 01:57:32,600
Uh, let's see.

2220
01:57:32,600 --> 01:57:34,320
Eric D says, Resident Evil 2.

2221
01:57:34,320 --> 01:57:37,700
When you get to the jail cells in the basement and the dogs break out and start chasing you

2222
01:57:37,700 --> 01:57:38,920
down some dark hallways.

2223
01:57:38,920 --> 01:57:40,520
Man, that scared the crap out of me.

2224
01:57:40,520 --> 01:57:43,600
So there's another one for dogs in Resident Evil.

2225
01:57:43,600 --> 01:57:44,600
Let's see.

2226
01:57:44,600 --> 01:57:47,280
Justin M says, the opening of Half Life 2 was pretty unnerving.

2227
01:57:47,280 --> 01:57:50,220
As was the in-browser boogeyman movie tie-in game.

2228
01:57:50,220 --> 01:57:54,520
Scared the bejesus out of me freshman year of college.

2229
01:57:54,520 --> 01:57:59,360
K. Sera Sera says, I don't play a lot of scary games really, but the first one that

2230
01:57:59,360 --> 01:58:04,200
ever creeped me out was the first adventure game that I ever played, Sanitarium.

2231
01:58:04,200 --> 01:58:07,920
There was a level where you were exploring an abandoned mental hospital with remnants

2232
01:58:07,920 --> 01:58:09,360
of bodies laying around.

2233
01:58:09,360 --> 01:58:13,400
The combination of this gross empty hospital, the creepy music, and the main character's

2234
01:58:13,400 --> 01:58:16,880
inner monologue definitely left me creeped out.

2235
01:58:16,880 --> 01:58:19,600
So those are only some of the answers, and I'm sorry I didn't read them all, but those

2236
01:58:19,600 --> 01:58:24,080
are some of the answers from our Facebook page over at Facebook.com slash Orange Launch

2237
01:58:24,080 --> 01:58:25,080
Radio.

2238
01:58:25,080 --> 01:58:27,440
Please go read the rest, because there's some great answers involving, like, Oculus Rift

2239
01:58:27,440 --> 01:58:30,040
and some other stuff too, so check it out.

2240
01:58:30,040 --> 01:58:32,600
Going to Google Plus and reading some answers there.

2241
01:58:32,600 --> 01:58:36,760
The birthday boy, ActDeft, says, playing a version on PC.

2242
01:58:36,760 --> 01:58:40,600
It starts out sweet and nice, and then the game starts messing with you in really freaked

2243
01:58:40,600 --> 01:58:41,600
out ways.

2244
01:58:41,600 --> 01:58:45,240
I played and finished the game in one sitting, but I was alone in my house and it was getting

2245
01:58:45,240 --> 01:58:48,960
dark too, so I really got scared as I progressed through it.

2246
01:58:48,960 --> 01:58:54,120
And lastly, Colin M. says, the PC version of Slender freaked me out sometime between

2247
01:58:54,120 --> 01:58:56,200
finding the fifth and sixth pages.

2248
01:58:56,200 --> 01:58:59,860
My flashlight had burned out and I was basically running around in the dark before the Slender

2249
01:58:59,860 --> 01:59:00,860
Man caught me.

2250
01:59:00,860 --> 01:59:03,280
Yeah, Slender Man, super scary game.

2251
01:59:03,280 --> 01:59:07,920
I don't know, until you've played it so many times, you kind of start to figure out the

2252
01:59:07,920 --> 01:59:12,200
patterns and it's numbed a little bit, but still a really good experience.

2253
01:59:12,200 --> 01:59:14,040
IKUMA JP just made my heart leap.

2254
01:59:14,040 --> 01:59:16,440
There was a Ju-On game for Wii.

2255
01:59:16,440 --> 01:59:17,440
Was it really?

2256
01:59:17,440 --> 01:59:18,440
Are you serious?

2257
01:59:18,440 --> 01:59:19,440
And I need this in my life.

2258
01:59:19,440 --> 01:59:20,440
I didn't know.

2259
01:59:20,440 --> 01:59:21,440
Oh yeah, I remember that.

2260
01:59:21,440 --> 01:59:22,440
It was terrible.

2261
01:59:22,440 --> 01:59:23,440
What?

2262
01:59:23,440 --> 01:59:24,440
You said it was good.

2263
01:59:24,440 --> 01:59:25,440
Didn't you say that?

2264
01:59:25,440 --> 01:59:26,440
No, I remember that came out a few years ago.

2265
01:59:26,440 --> 01:59:27,440
No, you just said it was scary.

2266
01:59:27,440 --> 01:59:30,200
And I remember telling everybody about that multiple times, especially you.

2267
01:59:30,200 --> 01:59:33,120
Yeah, well, I don't remember that because I don't pay attention to the Wii.

2268
01:59:33,120 --> 01:59:34,120
It's been a while.

2269
01:59:34,120 --> 01:59:36,640
I need this in my life and I don't care how bad it is.

2270
01:59:36,640 --> 01:59:40,640
I played the Project Runway game on Wii, which was pretty bad, but it's just a thing.

2271
01:59:40,640 --> 01:59:41,640
You have to try it.

2272
01:59:41,640 --> 01:59:45,600
I remember a scary moment when I thought my save file got corrupted.

2273
01:59:45,600 --> 01:59:48,400
I remember another scary moment in games.

2274
01:59:48,400 --> 01:59:49,400
Actually I thought of one.

2275
01:59:49,400 --> 01:59:52,120
What was the Silent Hill on 360 called?

2276
01:59:52,120 --> 01:59:53,120
The first one.

2277
01:59:53,120 --> 01:59:54,120
Silent Hill Homecoming?

2278
01:59:54,120 --> 01:59:55,120
Yes, Homecoming.

2279
01:59:55,120 --> 01:59:56,120
Homecoming was good.

2280
01:59:56,120 --> 01:59:57,120
I played that.

2281
01:59:57,120 --> 01:59:59,620
With that kid.

2282
01:59:59,620 --> 02:00:04,700
And I was home by myself in the dark and it was raining outside.

2283
02:00:04,700 --> 02:00:08,620
And you know how like when you're in the hospital in the very beginning, like a body falls just

2284
02:00:08,620 --> 02:00:12,140
from the air duct or something, like it just falls down in front of you?

2285
02:00:12,140 --> 02:00:15,140
You go, let the bodies hit the...

2286
02:00:15,140 --> 02:00:17,860
Well, I screamed and jumped out of my chair.

2287
02:00:17,860 --> 02:00:22,520
And because it was storming outside, the front door blew open.

2288
02:00:22,520 --> 02:00:26,900
And I promptly, like you can even see, step one, ran, slammed the door.

2289
02:00:26,900 --> 02:00:29,740
Step two, closed off the Xbox without even saving.

2290
02:00:29,740 --> 02:00:32,660
Step three, ran into the bedroom and got into the covers and cried.

2291
02:00:32,660 --> 02:00:33,660
I didn't really cry.

2292
02:00:33,660 --> 02:00:39,220
At least you said it was the Xbox, because if it was the Wii or the GameCube or something,

2293
02:00:39,220 --> 02:00:44,140
there is a potential that Rosetti may have come back and given you a nice long lecture

2294
02:00:44,140 --> 02:00:46,020
afterwards, which is equally scary.

2295
02:00:46,020 --> 02:00:49,700
Now there is a game that I mentioned in chat that I haven't heard anyone say anything about.

2296
02:00:49,700 --> 02:00:50,700
What's that?

2297
02:00:50,700 --> 02:00:51,700
Phantasmagoria.

2298
02:00:51,700 --> 02:00:52,700
Oh yeah, the old PC.

2299
02:00:52,700 --> 02:00:55,260
Which I have covered as a classic game.

2300
02:00:55,300 --> 02:00:57,980
Wasn't that Roberta Williams' last game or like one of her last games?

2301
02:00:57,980 --> 02:00:58,980
I think so.

2302
02:00:58,980 --> 02:00:59,980
Yeah, before she...

2303
02:00:59,980 --> 02:01:04,180
But I mean, that game was pretty hardcore for its time.

2304
02:01:04,180 --> 02:01:06,100
It was way ahead of its time.

2305
02:01:06,100 --> 02:01:09,340
And it was literally on seven or eight CDs.

2306
02:01:09,340 --> 02:01:10,340
It was seven.

2307
02:01:10,340 --> 02:01:12,100
It was all that...

2308
02:01:12,100 --> 02:01:15,340
That was during that phase, we had a really quick phase in gaming, it was right around

2309
02:01:15,340 --> 02:01:16,340
the same time as the Sega CD.

2310
02:01:16,340 --> 02:01:17,340
The full motion.

2311
02:01:17,340 --> 02:01:19,140
Yeah, the full motion acting.

2312
02:01:19,140 --> 02:01:20,900
Dan and I were actually just talking about that earlier today.

2313
02:01:20,900 --> 02:01:24,380
Because you had what, like Sewer Shark and Night Trap are some infamous Sega CD games

2314
02:01:24,380 --> 02:01:25,380
that had that.

2315
02:01:25,380 --> 02:01:29,660
Was it Super Soldier or some other game like that, that was a 32X CD game?

2316
02:01:29,660 --> 02:01:30,660
Well, I remember...

2317
02:01:30,660 --> 02:01:34,500
That only came out in some country, I don't remember.

2318
02:01:34,500 --> 02:01:39,620
Well, I remember on the PC you had Phantasmagoria, Seventh Guest was a huge one, and you're seeing

2319
02:01:39,620 --> 02:01:40,620
that.

2320
02:01:40,620 --> 02:01:41,620
They just re-released that on Steam.

2321
02:01:41,620 --> 02:01:42,620
And what was the sequel, Eleventh Hour?

2322
02:01:42,620 --> 02:01:43,620
Eleventh Hour.

2323
02:01:43,620 --> 02:01:48,140
And then, of course, SimCity with SimCity Action News.

2324
02:01:48,140 --> 02:01:49,140
Wing Commander.

2325
02:01:49,140 --> 02:01:50,980
The X-Files was on like eight or nine disc.

2326
02:01:50,980 --> 02:01:52,580
Wasn't Wing Commander 3 that one?

2327
02:01:52,580 --> 02:01:53,580
I only remember four.

2328
02:01:53,780 --> 02:01:54,780
I don't remember the first couple.

2329
02:01:54,780 --> 02:01:55,780
Wing Commander 3 was the one with Mark Hamill in it.

2330
02:01:55,780 --> 02:01:56,780
Yeah, I think so.

2331
02:01:56,780 --> 02:01:57,780
I believe so.

2332
02:01:57,780 --> 02:01:58,780
Gabriel Knight.

2333
02:01:58,780 --> 02:01:59,780
Yeah.

2334
02:01:59,780 --> 02:02:00,780
Gabriel Knight.

2335
02:02:00,780 --> 02:02:01,780
Tim Tripp just said.

2336
02:02:01,780 --> 02:02:02,780
Tim Tripp.

2337
02:02:02,780 --> 02:02:03,780
Yeah.

2338
02:02:03,780 --> 02:02:04,780
Didn't Gabriel Knight have Tim Curry?

2339
02:02:04,780 --> 02:02:05,780
I think it was just acted.

2340
02:02:05,780 --> 02:02:06,780
Maybe it was in the sequel.

2341
02:02:06,780 --> 02:02:07,780
Yeah.

2342
02:02:07,780 --> 02:02:12,420
But, I mean, there were tons of different horror games out that, you know, I'm sure

2343
02:02:12,420 --> 02:02:13,420
scared people.

2344
02:02:13,420 --> 02:02:18,620
But going back to the day, even old, you know, text games, I mean, being eaten by a grue

2345
02:02:18,620 --> 02:02:19,620
is pretty scary.

2346
02:02:19,620 --> 02:02:20,620
It is pretty scary.

2347
02:02:20,620 --> 02:02:21,620
Very scary.

2348
02:02:21,660 --> 02:02:22,660
All right.

2349
02:02:22,660 --> 02:02:25,940
Let's do a few more stories and then the mailbag and phone calls and all that.

2350
02:02:25,940 --> 02:02:26,940
So, Loki.

2351
02:02:26,940 --> 02:02:27,940
All right.

2352
02:02:27,940 --> 02:02:31,940
So, the Ouya.

2353
02:02:31,940 --> 02:02:33,660
They changed a few things.

2354
02:02:33,660 --> 02:02:36,700
One, they're redesigning the controller for the Ouya 2.

2355
02:02:36,700 --> 02:02:38,580
Yes, the Ouya 2 will be out next year.

2356
02:02:38,580 --> 02:02:41,380
At least that's what's planned right now.

2357
02:02:41,380 --> 02:02:43,860
And they're going back and redesigning the controller.

2358
02:02:43,860 --> 02:02:47,460
Actually, I think they've already redesigned the controller now and I'm kind of like confused

2359
02:02:47,460 --> 02:02:50,340
by it because I know that they redesigned the controller from when they kickstarted

2360
02:02:50,340 --> 02:02:52,820
to when they released.

2361
02:02:52,820 --> 02:02:55,940
But now they're talking about redesigning it again.

2362
02:02:55,940 --> 02:03:01,180
And one of the questions was, so, how am I going to know if I buy an Ouya if it's going

2363
02:03:01,180 --> 02:03:04,380
to be the one that has the redesigned controller that's supposed to be better or the older

2364
02:03:04,380 --> 02:03:07,240
one that the controller is not so good?

2365
02:03:07,240 --> 02:03:13,580
And Julie, Julie Ehrman said, you don't know.

2366
02:03:13,580 --> 02:03:16,100
So that's a great answer.

2367
02:03:16,100 --> 02:03:17,780
There is no way to distinguish that.

2368
02:03:17,780 --> 02:03:25,620
And of course, they're right now planning on shipping the Ouya 2, I guess, sometime

2369
02:03:25,620 --> 02:03:28,820
in 2014.

2370
02:03:28,820 --> 02:03:33,020
And they haven't finalized the date on it yet, but they're kind of investigating right

2371
02:03:33,020 --> 02:03:36,800
now what kind of graphics chip they want to put inside there to be able to support the

2372
02:03:36,800 --> 02:03:43,220
older games as well as push a little bit better performance out of newer games and titles.

2373
02:03:43,220 --> 02:03:47,240
I understand them bringing out another console so that they can find their happy medium and

2374
02:03:47,240 --> 02:03:50,680
find what's going to work and be relatively future proof.

2375
02:03:50,680 --> 02:03:54,080
But two consoles in two years.

2376
02:03:54,080 --> 02:04:00,040
I don't if the apology if they make that if they make that a trend, it just seems really

2377
02:04:00,040 --> 02:04:02,440
stupid for something that's supposed to be an Internet console.

2378
02:04:02,440 --> 02:04:04,560
Aren't you an iPhone user?

2379
02:04:04,560 --> 02:04:14,880
I just say point point, but I'm just saying I'm still using my 4S and and keep in mind

2380
02:04:14,880 --> 02:04:18,760
all of their all quality products as opposed to the Ouya.

2381
02:04:18,760 --> 02:04:23,920
Yeah, you don't have to buy every revision they they bring it forward because they have

2382
02:04:23,920 --> 02:04:24,920
new things.

2383
02:04:24,920 --> 02:04:29,800
I'm still I'm still rocking my iPad third generation, aka the one that Apple would rather

2384
02:04:29,800 --> 02:04:31,160
you just forget about.

2385
02:04:31,160 --> 02:04:35,520
You know, this is the only other iPad they still sell the iPad 2.

2386
02:04:35,520 --> 02:04:36,520
Right?

2387
02:04:36,520 --> 02:04:37,520
Yes.

2388
02:04:37,520 --> 02:04:40,000
And all I have to say to hell with the iPad Air.

2389
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:42,840
I'm still going to rock that iPad third generation do it.

2390
02:04:42,840 --> 02:04:43,840
That's right.

2391
02:04:43,840 --> 02:04:45,680
I got a display in my old school charger.

2392
02:04:45,680 --> 02:04:48,720
It's all I need to do it.

2393
02:04:48,720 --> 02:04:49,720
Loki's like, can I finish?

2394
02:04:49,720 --> 02:04:51,720
We're also talking about like a six hundred dollar difference.

2395
02:04:51,720 --> 02:04:52,720
But please.

2396
02:04:52,720 --> 02:04:54,040
Well, here's the thing, too.

2397
02:04:54,040 --> 02:04:58,920
The problem, though, with coming out with an Ouya 2.0 or whatever is you're not coming

2398
02:04:58,920 --> 02:05:00,500
out now first anymore.

2399
02:05:00,500 --> 02:05:05,720
Now you're coming out in potentially a field where there are going to be multiple consoles

2400
02:05:05,720 --> 02:05:10,120
out there that do the same type of thing, whose amateurs will blow yours away.

2401
02:05:10,120 --> 02:05:11,120
Exactly.

2402
02:05:11,120 --> 02:05:15,120
You can do your thing better and for probably cheaper.

2403
02:05:15,120 --> 02:05:19,160
And one of the things that, you know, she's basically said, oh, hey, you know what?

2404
02:05:19,160 --> 02:05:23,360
We're open to cloud gaming and hey, we're even open to our storefront being on third

2405
02:05:23,360 --> 02:05:24,360
party hardware.

2406
02:05:24,360 --> 02:05:25,780
We'll do anything.

2407
02:05:25,780 --> 02:05:27,120
So we'll blow anyone.

2408
02:05:27,120 --> 02:05:30,200
Why the fuck would I want to buy an Ouya 2?

2409
02:05:30,200 --> 02:05:33,680
We're open to putting a flashlight in the side of the console.

2410
02:05:33,680 --> 02:05:37,120
And it says that if they really wanted to be clever, they are passing up a fantastic

2411
02:05:37,120 --> 02:05:38,560
marketing idea.

2412
02:05:38,560 --> 02:05:39,560
The 2.0.

2413
02:05:39,560 --> 02:05:40,560
I'm just saying.

2414
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:44,320
I'm just saying if they put a flashlight in a porn edition, that's what people really

2415
02:05:44,320 --> 02:05:45,320
want.

2416
02:05:45,320 --> 02:05:47,360
If they put a flashlight in the side of that console, it's going to have to be for really

2417
02:05:47,360 --> 02:05:50,240
small dick people because that is a really small console.

2418
02:05:50,240 --> 02:05:55,360
I just know the flashlight will be bigger than the console.

2419
02:05:55,360 --> 02:06:00,400
So what you're saying is it will look like a giant cylinder, a.k.a. the new Mac that

2420
02:06:00,400 --> 02:06:01,400
they have out there.

2421
02:06:01,400 --> 02:06:03,640
It looks like a fucking trash can.

2422
02:06:03,640 --> 02:06:05,400
It actually does.

2423
02:06:05,400 --> 02:06:06,400
I can't argue it.

2424
02:06:06,400 --> 02:06:10,280
I can like say it's way sage and give this shit.

2425
02:06:10,280 --> 02:06:11,520
It's expensive.

2426
02:06:11,520 --> 02:06:13,880
It does slightly better things than the last one.

2427
02:06:13,880 --> 02:06:20,960
You'll release yet another computer in a year or two that will look stupid and will do something

2428
02:06:20,960 --> 02:06:23,840
slightly better than the other one will be fucking expensive and everyone will go buy

2429
02:06:23,840 --> 02:06:24,840
it.

2430
02:06:24,840 --> 02:06:30,800
The other problem with the Ouya is that because they didn't discontinue the Wii in North America,

2431
02:06:30,800 --> 02:06:36,240
you can get a dirt fucking cheap console here that plays a heck of a lot more games than

2432
02:06:36,240 --> 02:06:37,880
what's really available on Ouya.

2433
02:06:37,880 --> 02:06:38,880
I gotta be honest.

2434
02:06:39,600 --> 02:06:46,280
If you're out there in the market and you're like, hell, I need a system to play Android

2435
02:06:46,280 --> 02:06:53,380
games on my TV and that's what I wanna do, go with the fucking Mojo console because at

2436
02:06:53,380 --> 02:07:00,160
least that one uses Google Play for one and two, you can use your controller and map it

2437
02:07:00,160 --> 02:07:02,380
to pretty much any game you want.

2438
02:07:02,380 --> 02:07:08,200
So that includes stuff that's probably on the Ouya already and stuff that's in the Google

2439
02:07:08,200 --> 02:07:10,280
Play marketplace that's free.

2440
02:07:10,280 --> 02:07:17,960
So why would you spend money on this stuff that has a locked out marketplace, which let

2441
02:07:17,960 --> 02:07:18,960
me put it this way.

2442
02:07:18,960 --> 02:07:20,560
I had the console for a while.

2443
02:07:20,560 --> 02:07:22,240
There are some okay games on there.

2444
02:07:22,240 --> 02:07:25,480
They're promising there's gonna be more games on there that'll be good, but you know what?

2445
02:07:25,480 --> 02:07:28,960
All those people, they're fucking not just making their games exclusively to the Ouya.

2446
02:07:28,960 --> 02:07:32,000
It's coming out in PC and Android and all that stuff.

2447
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:38,200
So you might as well just put the money into a Steam box or a computer that runs Steam

2448
02:07:38,200 --> 02:07:43,200
or something or put it into another micro console or just fucking just...

2449
02:07:43,200 --> 02:07:47,400
Or give it to me and we'll buy a new mic for the show or something.

2450
02:07:47,400 --> 02:07:49,400
Just don't waste your money on this stuff.

2451
02:07:49,400 --> 02:07:51,000
We could use a new mic.

2452
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:54,760
Or buy a used Ouya, I mean, if you really want to.

2453
02:07:54,760 --> 02:07:55,760
I don't know.

2454
02:07:55,760 --> 02:07:57,780
I just don't see, there's not a lot.

2455
02:07:57,780 --> 02:08:00,660
There's no real reason why you want to get a new Ouya.

2456
02:08:00,660 --> 02:08:08,580
Because they were saying before, oh, you're gonna be able to run XBMC on it and stuff.

2457
02:08:08,580 --> 02:08:12,160
Well except it doesn't run it very well, so why would you do that?

2458
02:08:12,160 --> 02:08:18,760
You can get really cheap tablets nowadays and a lot of them already have HDMI out.

2459
02:08:18,760 --> 02:08:23,580
So I don't know, especially with what?

2460
02:08:23,580 --> 02:08:26,920
The Google thing that they have now where you can plug it into your TV and more support

2461
02:08:26,960 --> 02:08:27,960
for apps for that.

2462
02:08:27,960 --> 02:08:28,960
Chromecast.

2463
02:08:28,960 --> 02:08:34,040
Yeah Chromecast, you don't really need a micro console because a lot of other shit is doing

2464
02:08:34,040 --> 02:08:35,040
this stuff already.

2465
02:08:35,040 --> 02:08:39,920
It's like Dan and I were talking this morning about taking, because we're probably gonna

2466
02:08:39,920 --> 02:08:45,360
eventually gut our front room computer and put it in a new frame and I was like, well

2467
02:08:45,360 --> 02:08:48,880
you have people who build like the Nintendo computers with the small bits.

2468
02:08:48,880 --> 02:08:55,120
I've wanted to do one out of a 1950s radio, but I mean you can build these things for

2469
02:08:55,120 --> 02:08:59,000
yourself at home and they'll run whatever you need them to run within reason.

2470
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:03,700
You know, coming by parts is just a matter of smart shopping.

2471
02:09:03,700 --> 02:09:07,400
Especially if you're gonna make a system, if all you're interested in is emulators,

2472
02:09:07,400 --> 02:09:10,760
you don't need that powerful of a system to run emulators.

2473
02:09:10,760 --> 02:09:11,760
I mean seriously.

2474
02:09:11,760 --> 02:09:13,800
Get a Dreamcast.

2475
02:09:13,800 --> 02:09:17,120
Just buy a fucking old ass PC, you can probably do that.

2476
02:09:17,120 --> 02:09:20,240
Yeah Dreamcast, but Dreamcast even that doesn't run everything very smoothly.

2477
02:09:20,240 --> 02:09:21,240
It'll run Nintendo.

2478
02:09:21,240 --> 02:09:25,720
You still have to go through some hoops for that, but just get an old PC.

2479
02:09:25,720 --> 02:09:30,360
That's what our front room computer that we have was pretty much given to us when someone

2480
02:09:30,360 --> 02:09:31,360
was done with it.

2481
02:09:31,360 --> 02:09:33,360
I think it was Dan's mom or somebody.

2482
02:09:33,360 --> 02:09:37,960
But I mean all we use it for is emulator games so we don't feel like busting out the Super

2483
02:09:37,960 --> 02:09:43,240
Nintendo and watching Netflix and Hulu.

2484
02:09:43,240 --> 02:09:44,240
That's it.

2485
02:09:44,240 --> 02:09:49,120
And also if you're interested in buying a Ouya and god forbid they kickstart something

2486
02:09:49,120 --> 02:09:53,740
else again, just remember how wonderful the Kickstarter went the first time around.

2487
02:09:53,740 --> 02:09:55,200
Ask up front who's shipping.

2488
02:09:55,200 --> 02:10:01,200
As in, as in right now, some people that backed that Kickstarter still don't have their fucking

2489
02:10:01,200 --> 02:10:02,880
console yet.

2490
02:10:02,880 --> 02:10:03,880
Just saying.

2491
02:10:03,880 --> 02:10:10,080
And for the record, at Radio Shack where my husband manages, I saw laptops there that

2492
02:10:10,080 --> 02:10:15,520
were fully equipped to do everything that the Ouya can do for 250 bucks.

2493
02:10:15,520 --> 02:10:20,600
So you can get a laptop instead of getting that piece of garbage.

2494
02:10:20,600 --> 02:10:21,600
It's still not 99.

2495
02:10:21,600 --> 02:10:22,600
It's still not 99.

2496
02:10:22,600 --> 02:10:23,600
All right.

2497
02:10:23,600 --> 02:10:24,600
Yeah, but you get a lot more value.

2498
02:10:24,600 --> 02:10:26,240
It was to say that the next one's going to be $99.

2499
02:10:26,240 --> 02:10:27,240
That's the other thing too.

2500
02:10:27,240 --> 02:10:28,240
All right.

2501
02:10:28,240 --> 02:10:29,240
Moving on.

2502
02:10:29,240 --> 02:10:30,240
Moving on, guys.

2503
02:10:30,240 --> 02:10:35,120
I it's a another week, so there must be another story coming out of EA somewhere that's hating

2504
02:10:35,120 --> 02:10:36,680
on the Wii U.

2505
02:10:36,680 --> 02:10:39,120
And here we go.

2506
02:10:39,120 --> 02:10:42,620
Creative director Craig Sullivan from Ghost Games.

2507
02:10:42,620 --> 02:10:45,400
So technically it's not EA, but you know.

2508
02:10:45,400 --> 02:10:49,040
So Craig Sullivan with Ghost Games is making Need for Speed Rivals.

2509
02:10:49,040 --> 02:10:54,120
And in an interview with the Sixaxis talks about why it's not coming to the Wii U.

2510
02:10:54,120 --> 02:10:59,160
Rivals is going on new hardware and you have to work out where you focus your efforts.

2511
02:10:59,160 --> 02:11:03,760
The 200 people working on this game are only capable of so much and doing so many different

2512
02:11:03,760 --> 02:11:04,800
versions of the game.

2513
02:11:04,800 --> 02:11:08,320
So we had to go with where we think the biggest audience will be for the game.

2514
02:11:08,320 --> 02:11:10,520
And that's where we are.

2515
02:11:10,520 --> 02:11:15,160
As you may or may not know, Need for Speed Rivals is running on the Frostbite 3 engine.

2516
02:11:15,160 --> 02:11:18,660
This year we had news that they're not going to bother with putting Frostbite 3 engine

2517
02:11:18,660 --> 02:11:23,240
on the Wii U, back when EA kind of first was talking about how they're distancing themselves

2518
02:11:23,240 --> 02:11:27,400
from the Wii U, because the Wii U can't handle it or whatever, which means it's not going

2519
02:11:27,400 --> 02:11:29,200
to get Dragon Age or Mass Effect.

2520
02:11:29,200 --> 02:11:32,040
It's not going to get any of that, because those are all going to be on the Frostbite

2521
02:11:32,040 --> 02:11:34,800
3 engine as well.

2522
02:11:34,800 --> 02:11:36,680
So there you go.

2523
02:11:36,680 --> 02:11:40,640
Need for Speed Rivals not coming on the Wii U anytime soon.

2524
02:11:40,640 --> 02:11:47,280
And stories like this are never really a great sign for that system, but Nintendo is going

2525
02:11:47,280 --> 02:11:52,400
to keep pumping out their games that will carry that system well enough.

2526
02:11:52,400 --> 02:11:57,600
And I also kind of think, I've got to be really honest here when it comes to the whole journalism

2527
02:11:57,600 --> 02:12:03,760
element of this story, I kind of think in this interview you're baiting this guy to

2528
02:12:03,760 --> 02:12:05,460
hate on the Wii U.

2529
02:12:05,460 --> 02:12:09,740
Because I think when you look at a game like Need for Speed Rivals, or a lot of the stuff

2530
02:12:09,860 --> 02:12:15,860
that goes to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, you know the Wii U can't handle that stuff.

2531
02:12:15,860 --> 02:12:21,620
Like, you know, the Wii U is based a little more off the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, granted

2532
02:12:21,620 --> 02:12:25,460
what's in there is a little more powerful, but we all kind of know that what's inside

2533
02:12:25,460 --> 02:12:29,940
a Wii U is not the same thing that's inside these other systems.

2534
02:12:29,940 --> 02:12:32,580
So weren't we kind of baiting this guy a little bit?

2535
02:12:32,580 --> 02:12:36,140
Isn't the answer obvious why this game is not on Wii U?

2536
02:12:36,140 --> 02:12:41,220
Well, it's like you said, that they're making it for multiple consoles, and so they only

2537
02:12:41,220 --> 02:12:45,660
have enough, okay we can only put it on X number of different consoles, and so we're

2538
02:12:45,660 --> 02:12:48,900
going to pick the ones that have what we think are going to be the largest market share.

2539
02:12:48,900 --> 02:12:50,420
I mean, that just makes sense.

2540
02:12:50,420 --> 02:12:53,220
But yes, they are masturbators.

2541
02:12:53,220 --> 02:12:57,460
Dark Tetsuya in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, this story frustrates me, because I

2542
02:12:57,460 --> 02:13:01,740
love Need for Speed and I want a Wii U, and that customization stuff would be perfect

2543
02:13:01,740 --> 02:13:02,740
for the touchpad.

2544
02:13:03,340 --> 02:13:08,340
Yeah, it's kind of a bummer, more people don't think to do it, but...

2545
02:13:08,340 --> 02:13:13,820
If only, you know, the Xbox 360 had a second screen app or something that you could, you

2546
02:13:13,820 --> 02:13:16,900
know, use the touchpad to do customization.

2547
02:13:16,900 --> 02:13:18,820
If only they had that!

2548
02:13:18,820 --> 02:13:22,620
Didn't you listen to Bobby's show earlier tonight, when our good pal Bobby Blackwolf

2549
02:13:22,620 --> 02:13:24,780
always tapes before us here at VOG Network.

2550
02:13:24,780 --> 02:13:28,660
He was talking about, he went to the Xbox One preview event in Atlanta, and was like

2551
02:13:28,700 --> 02:13:34,100
asking questions about, now I don't even remember the name of it, Smart Glass.

2552
02:13:34,100 --> 02:13:37,100
I just think Smart Ass, like Smart Ass, like Loki, but it's Smart Glass.

2553
02:13:37,100 --> 02:13:39,300
You mean that app I downloaded that I've never used?

2554
02:13:39,300 --> 02:13:43,060
They didn't even know what it was.

2555
02:13:43,060 --> 02:13:45,700
The people that were demoing, like, because he asked one of the games he was playing,

2556
02:13:45,700 --> 02:13:47,620
he was like, oh, how does this integrate Smart Glass?

2557
02:13:47,620 --> 02:13:51,700
Because it had a really kind of, it was like drawing, and they were like, what's Smart

2558
02:13:51,700 --> 02:13:52,700
Glass?

2559
02:13:52,700 --> 02:13:53,700
I...

2560
02:13:53,700 --> 02:13:54,700
What?

2561
02:13:54,700 --> 02:13:55,700
What?

2562
02:13:55,700 --> 02:13:57,220
That definitely is deserved.

2563
02:13:57,220 --> 02:13:58,820
Mark Zuckerberg will know what I'm talking about with this.

2564
02:13:58,820 --> 02:14:04,580
That's definitely a moment where you just kind of look at that person and go, girl.

2565
02:14:04,580 --> 02:14:09,340
It's kind of funny, because there's a lot of opportunity in theory with the surface

2566
02:14:09,340 --> 02:14:11,340
for stuff like that.

2567
02:14:11,340 --> 02:14:12,340
Right?

2568
02:14:12,340 --> 02:14:14,460
Well, anyway.

2569
02:14:14,460 --> 02:14:18,960
It's like, you've got all this second screen technology, like slapping you in the face,

2570
02:14:18,960 --> 02:14:21,620
and still nobody wants to jump on boards.

2571
02:14:21,620 --> 02:14:24,100
Except Nintendo, sorta.

2572
02:14:24,100 --> 02:14:27,860
Although certainly there's those wank rumors that they're thinking about releasing a new

2573
02:14:27,860 --> 02:14:30,740
Wii that doesn't have the touchpad, so they can rule the button.

2574
02:14:30,740 --> 02:14:31,740
A Wii U?

2575
02:14:31,740 --> 02:14:32,740
Yeah, that's what I meant.

2576
02:14:32,740 --> 02:14:33,740
The Wii U without the touchpad.

2577
02:14:33,740 --> 02:14:34,740
But I don't know.

2578
02:14:34,740 --> 02:14:37,060
And again, wank, wank, wank, wank, wank.

2579
02:14:37,060 --> 02:14:38,980
I don't know how much stock I put in there.

2580
02:14:38,980 --> 02:14:39,980
Why?

2581
02:14:39,980 --> 02:14:44,460
At that point, it's like, you're taking the gimmick out, so now there's no reason.

2582
02:14:44,460 --> 02:14:45,780
It is...

2583
02:14:45,780 --> 02:14:48,220
Yeah, because that worked so well with the Wii Mini.

2584
02:14:48,220 --> 02:14:51,660
They took out all the extra features that you didn't really need, like internet, you

2585
02:14:51,660 --> 02:14:52,660
know, and...

2586
02:14:52,660 --> 02:14:55,220
Back and focus on what made the Wii so popular.

2587
02:14:55,220 --> 02:14:57,620
All that, the flailing with the controller.

2588
02:14:57,620 --> 02:14:58,620
Why not?

2589
02:14:58,620 --> 02:15:00,620
Wii Sports HD, buddy.

2590
02:15:00,620 --> 02:15:03,140
It's coming.

2591
02:15:03,140 --> 02:15:09,320
Anyhow, let's see what the listeners think in a segment we call the Mailbag.

2592
02:15:09,320 --> 02:15:13,740
Every week, you guys send us emails, mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com, and Dark Soccer

2593
02:15:13,740 --> 02:15:20,140
will dive into the mailbag headfirst and find some emails that she deems worthy of being

2594
02:15:20,140 --> 02:15:21,140
read here on the show.

2595
02:15:21,140 --> 02:15:22,140
I know we...

2596
02:15:22,140 --> 02:15:23,140
I gotta...

2597
02:15:23,140 --> 02:15:26,540
We spoiled this a little bit earlier in the show with one email, but there's still plenty

2598
02:15:26,540 --> 02:15:29,140
more unlicked, unspoiled emails to go.

2599
02:15:29,140 --> 02:15:30,140
We got a bunch.

2600
02:15:30,140 --> 02:15:31,140
We did get a lot tonight, didn't we?

2601
02:15:31,140 --> 02:15:33,140
We got a couple more, actually, after checking the mailbag.

2602
02:15:33,140 --> 02:15:34,620
Oh, you don't have to read them all, you know?

2603
02:15:34,620 --> 02:15:36,140
Well, I'm gonna, because Gonna emailed.

2604
02:15:36,140 --> 02:15:37,140
All right.

2605
02:15:37,140 --> 02:15:38,140
Well, you can skip his.

2606
02:15:38,140 --> 02:15:39,140
Shit.

2607
02:15:39,140 --> 02:15:40,140
You know what?

2608
02:15:40,140 --> 02:15:41,140
I'm just kidding.

2609
02:15:41,140 --> 02:15:43,140
Hi, Jamie, Loki, and I guess Rob.

2610
02:15:43,140 --> 02:15:44,900
You see what I mean?

2611
02:15:44,900 --> 02:15:45,900
Yeah.

2612
02:15:45,900 --> 02:15:49,460
I heard Rob talking about Pokemon not really utilizing the 3D, and I was curious if you

2613
02:15:49,460 --> 02:15:52,900
guys think it's even worth it to buy the 3DS or just go with the 2DS.

2614
02:15:52,900 --> 02:15:57,340
I'm still trying to decide between the two, and I would love to hear what you all think.

2615
02:15:57,340 --> 02:16:00,660
Thanks for making my unbearable weekend commutes less horrible, Gemet.

2616
02:16:00,660 --> 02:16:03,020
Wear pants with large pockets.

2617
02:16:03,020 --> 02:16:05,420
No, 3DS.

2618
02:16:05,420 --> 02:16:07,520
Yes, 2DS.

2619
02:16:07,520 --> 02:16:09,100
If you have a man bag.

2620
02:16:09,100 --> 02:16:10,100
That's true.

2621
02:16:10,100 --> 02:16:11,100
If you have...

2622
02:16:11,100 --> 02:16:12,100
Gemet probably does accessorize with a man purse.

2623
02:16:12,100 --> 02:16:15,560
They do have cases for the 2DS.

2624
02:16:15,560 --> 02:16:21,380
In all honesty, I still think the 3DS XL is the best system because the screens are still

2625
02:16:21,380 --> 02:16:26,440
larger on an XL, and I might also be a little biased because I really want that freaking

2626
02:16:26,440 --> 02:16:30,080
Zelda 3DS XL that's coming out.

2627
02:16:30,080 --> 02:16:35,560
So I still think the XL is the best one of any of them, but the 2DS is not a bad alternative,

2628
02:16:35,560 --> 02:16:37,200
and it is a much lower price.

2629
02:16:37,200 --> 02:16:42,800
So you kind of have to just ask yourself, how much is A, a bigger screen, and B, 3D

2630
02:16:42,800 --> 02:16:43,800
worth?

2631
02:16:43,800 --> 02:16:47,040
Otherwise, functionally, they're really the same system.

2632
02:16:47,040 --> 02:16:52,720
But if all you want to do is play Pokemon, then shit, get the 2DS.

2633
02:16:52,720 --> 02:16:53,720
It doesn't really matter.

2634
02:16:53,720 --> 02:16:58,400
But if you're thinking about the future, the 3D does really come in handy in some games

2635
02:16:58,400 --> 02:17:00,480
like Super Mario 3D Land you're talking about.

2636
02:17:00,480 --> 02:17:01,760
3D is really useful in that game.

2637
02:17:01,760 --> 02:17:06,120
I use it actually on occasion in Animal Crossing, even though I can't keep the 3D on for very

2638
02:17:06,120 --> 02:17:12,280
long, but I use it to catch flying bugs just because sometimes it's really hard to tell

2639
02:17:12,280 --> 02:17:18,120
where they are in relation to where you are without the 3D.

2640
02:17:18,120 --> 02:17:23,440
It also depends, I mean, even though I don't use the 3D, if I had a choice between the

2641
02:17:23,440 --> 02:17:27,840
two, if someone was like, here, pick one, I'd still probably stick with the 3DS because

2642
02:17:27,840 --> 02:17:30,460
I also like having it collapse.

2643
02:17:30,460 --> 02:17:32,760
I like having it close.

2644
02:17:32,760 --> 02:17:36,940
And that's always been something to like, because I actually adjust my screen level

2645
02:17:36,940 --> 02:17:42,240
depending on if I'm sitting down and playing, if I happen to be in the car, which I don't

2646
02:17:42,240 --> 02:17:44,580
really play that much in the car, but...

2647
02:17:44,580 --> 02:17:47,880
You really do have to question some of the design choices around the 2DS.

2648
02:17:47,880 --> 02:17:48,880
I mean, it feels...

2649
02:17:48,880 --> 02:17:49,880
It's intended for kids.

2650
02:17:49,880 --> 02:17:53,480
When it's in your hands, it feels nice, but yeah, just the whole fact it doesn't close

2651
02:17:53,480 --> 02:17:54,480
is, I don't know.

2652
02:17:54,480 --> 02:17:55,720
But I get the hinges right.

2653
02:17:55,720 --> 02:17:57,120
You were moving parts.

2654
02:17:57,120 --> 02:17:58,120
Yeah.

2655
02:17:58,120 --> 02:18:01,720
Well, on top of that, you have wires running in the hinges too.

2656
02:18:01,720 --> 02:18:03,040
It's just like with a regular laptop.

2657
02:18:03,040 --> 02:18:04,040
Sure, sure.

2658
02:18:04,040 --> 02:18:09,480
So you have a lot more room to make it completely unplayable as opposed to, you know, one full

2659
02:18:09,480 --> 02:18:12,320
put together hard plastic piece.

2660
02:18:12,320 --> 02:18:16,720
So honestly, Gemit, you kind of just have to ask yourself, like, how much is it worth?

2661
02:18:16,720 --> 02:18:21,240
Like, am I willing to pay that extra money to have the larger screens and have it close

2662
02:18:21,240 --> 02:18:22,240
up?

2663
02:18:22,240 --> 02:18:24,320
And if that's really not a big deal to you and there's really only the one game you want

2664
02:18:24,320 --> 02:18:26,160
to play on it, then fuck it, get a 2DS.

2665
02:18:26,160 --> 02:18:27,160
Why not?

2666
02:18:27,160 --> 02:18:30,640
By the way, Gemit says it's a messenger bag.

2667
02:18:30,640 --> 02:18:34,440
Wait for a bundle with a design that you really, really like and then buy that whatever it

2668
02:18:34,440 --> 02:18:35,680
is, 2D or 3D.

2669
02:18:35,680 --> 02:18:39,040
There is a Pokemon 3DS XL for what it's worth, red and blue one.

2670
02:18:39,040 --> 02:18:41,560
Or have wonderful, wonderful friends like Slidekick.

2671
02:18:41,560 --> 02:18:43,560
There you go.

2672
02:18:43,560 --> 02:18:44,560
Thank you so much.

2673
02:18:44,560 --> 02:18:46,520
That's the only reason I have a 3DS.

2674
02:18:46,520 --> 02:18:47,520
Thank you for feeding my addiction.

2675
02:18:47,520 --> 02:18:48,520
I love you.

2676
02:18:48,520 --> 02:18:49,520
What a nice boy.

2677
02:18:49,520 --> 02:18:50,520
Yes.

2678
02:18:50,520 --> 02:18:51,520
You get cookies.

2679
02:18:51,520 --> 02:18:52,520
Hey, OLR.

2680
02:18:52,520 --> 02:18:56,280
Before I go into the meat of my email, I thought I'd update my situation with Gamerscape.

2681
02:18:56,280 --> 02:18:58,160
This is Rossdale, UT.

2682
02:18:58,160 --> 02:19:02,040
I tried to file a complaint against them with the BBB, but they didn't seem to have a site

2683
02:19:02,040 --> 02:19:06,760
listed in their business and I couldn't find the address or the like, which seems to be

2684
02:19:06,760 --> 02:19:10,960
required when submitting a complaint about a business the BBB is unaware of.

2685
02:19:10,960 --> 02:19:15,600
All I could get is that they're in Stockholm, Sweden, and I'm not going to burn a charge

2686
02:19:15,600 --> 02:19:16,680
back over $10.

2687
02:19:16,680 --> 02:19:19,160
I'm not sure what, if anything, I can do about this.

2688
02:19:19,160 --> 02:19:23,360
I'm probably just out of luck and left telling anyone who will listen to avoid that piss

2689
02:19:23,360 --> 02:19:25,360
hole of a site.

2690
02:19:25,360 --> 02:19:27,800
You're using opinions expressed by the emailer.

2691
02:19:27,800 --> 02:19:28,800
You're not necessarily...

2692
02:19:28,800 --> 02:19:29,800
Well...

2693
02:19:29,800 --> 02:19:30,800
I don't know this site at all.

2694
02:19:30,800 --> 02:19:36,280
But there are businesses that do keep foreign addresses to precisely not have to answer.

2695
02:19:36,800 --> 02:19:42,200
Good on him for following up and putting his angry pen where his mouth is, so to speak.

2696
02:19:42,200 --> 02:19:43,200
Well, no.

2697
02:19:43,200 --> 02:19:48,680
You know, what was the thing that I used to quote from some study that I did in customer

2698
02:19:48,680 --> 02:19:50,120
service actually?

2699
02:19:50,120 --> 02:19:56,280
That out of every eight people with a complaint, only one will be an advocate.

2700
02:19:56,280 --> 02:19:58,040
That means only one person will do something about it.

2701
02:19:58,040 --> 02:20:00,760
So thank you for being an advocate.

2702
02:20:00,760 --> 02:20:04,520
Anyway, enough of those cancers on gaming.

2703
02:20:04,520 --> 02:20:05,520
Wow.

2704
02:20:05,760 --> 02:20:08,600
Someone asked me if I considered Desura my happy alternative.

2705
02:20:08,600 --> 02:20:12,400
Unlike many, I don't have a real preference when it comes to services other than they

2706
02:20:12,400 --> 02:20:14,160
offer DRM free games.

2707
02:20:14,160 --> 02:20:20,040
Desura is DRM agnostic, meaning they'll put games that publishers are absolutely adamant

2708
02:20:20,040 --> 02:20:21,040
about DRM.

2709
02:20:21,040 --> 02:20:25,180
However, they do make sure to let you know that if you're getting a game that needs DRM,

2710
02:20:25,180 --> 02:20:26,340
so I know what to avoid.

2711
02:20:26,340 --> 02:20:30,500
I just wish I could filter out DRM titles in search.

2712
02:20:30,500 --> 02:20:35,460
Other sites I use are Indie Game Stand, GOG, and Humble Bundle.

2713
02:20:35,460 --> 02:20:38,740
Also I've just recently discovered that if a site is selling their game with the Humble

2714
02:20:38,740 --> 02:20:43,520
widget, it can be linked to your Humble Bundle account, which greatly expands my options.

2715
02:20:43,520 --> 02:20:47,900
I found a place called Bundle in a Box, and I haven't known of them long enough to see

2716
02:20:47,900 --> 02:20:50,700
a bundle I want from them, but I'll get back to you on that.

2717
02:20:50,700 --> 02:20:56,340
I've also looked at Dotemu, which seems to be a GOG-like service, so I'll be giving them

2718
02:20:56,340 --> 02:20:57,340
a try when I can.

2719
02:20:57,340 --> 02:21:00,380
Basically, I'll go wherever to get my PC games DRM free.

2720
02:21:00,380 --> 02:21:01,940
So that's my answer to Rob's question.

2721
02:21:01,940 --> 02:21:04,660
Anyway, I hope you guys don't mind my whining.

2722
02:21:04,860 --> 02:21:07,340
I like that he had an answer to the question, so thank you.

2723
02:21:07,340 --> 02:21:14,340
To go back to the whole Gamersgate thing, if you do a Whois search on them, just type

2724
02:21:14,340 --> 02:21:19,940
Whois in Google, type in their URL when it pops up on the GoDaddy site, it'll give you

2725
02:21:19,940 --> 02:21:22,060
their address right there.

2726
02:21:22,060 --> 02:21:27,740
But as he said, Stockholm, Sweden, the actual company's name is apparently Paradox Interactive

2727
02:21:27,740 --> 02:21:29,060
AB.

2728
02:21:29,060 --> 02:21:32,900
There's also Lupia AB, and various other things.

2729
02:21:32,900 --> 02:21:35,620
But yeah, definitely registered overseas.

2730
02:21:35,620 --> 02:21:37,740
Someone out of BBB reach.

2731
02:21:37,740 --> 02:21:43,380
Also, PS, when are you going to include the forums in your Frugal Question of the Week?

2732
02:21:43,380 --> 02:21:46,620
I, for one, don't like social media networks.

2733
02:21:46,620 --> 02:21:51,060
That's a fair question, but honestly, our forums have not been very active at vognetwork.com,

2734
02:21:51,060 --> 02:21:54,820
and I just kind of think, I don't know, I wonder if maybe forums in general just aren't

2735
02:21:54,820 --> 02:21:57,220
really a thing these days.

2736
02:21:57,220 --> 02:21:59,780
What in general would get people to participate more in the forums?

2737
02:21:59,780 --> 02:22:02,180
Change it to a BBS.

2738
02:22:03,180 --> 02:22:08,060
I am all for setting up a vognetwork BBS, where we could play games like Legend of the

2739
02:22:08,060 --> 02:22:09,060
Red Dragon.

2740
02:22:09,060 --> 02:22:12,420
Actually, I would so be down for that, that would be awesome, but that has nothing to

2741
02:22:12,420 --> 02:22:16,940
do with a frickin' PHP BB, so I don't know.

2742
02:22:16,940 --> 02:22:21,020
I mean, I guess the obvious answer is, well, Rob, try posting that on the forums and see

2743
02:22:21,020 --> 02:22:22,020
what happens.

2744
02:22:22,020 --> 02:22:23,020
Or...

2745
02:22:23,020 --> 02:22:27,180
I'm also going to be honest, most of the questions I think of the day of the show, and a large

2746
02:22:27,180 --> 02:22:31,160
part of that is that we don't always know all the news until the day of the show.

2747
02:22:31,160 --> 02:22:34,120
So you wouldn't have a lot of time, and that's one concern I have.

2748
02:22:34,120 --> 02:22:39,640
And Facebook and Google, whether you love them or hate them, are always very immediate.

2749
02:22:39,640 --> 02:22:43,640
You see, you know, people check their news feed all the time and so forth, so that's

2750
02:22:43,640 --> 02:22:45,200
what makes it attractive.

2751
02:22:45,200 --> 02:22:49,760
However, as a suggestion, and I myself am doing something similar, if you happen to

2752
02:22:49,760 --> 02:22:55,760
see something from a Frugal Question of the Week, and you feel would make a good personal

2753
02:22:55,760 --> 02:22:58,400
editorial, why not try to submit some content?

2754
02:22:58,400 --> 02:22:59,400
Oh yeah.

2755
02:22:59,640 --> 02:23:02,920
You know, send us an article if you have something to say about something that's been a Frugal

2756
02:23:02,920 --> 02:23:03,920
Question.

2757
02:23:03,920 --> 02:23:08,800
And, you know, assuming it's not full of, you know, accusing too many people or companies

2758
02:23:08,800 --> 02:23:13,000
of being cancers on gaming, we might publish it.

2759
02:23:13,000 --> 02:23:18,840
You know, we do want a little bit more diplomacy in things on our site.

2760
02:23:18,840 --> 02:23:20,200
And Black Wolf does have a good point.

2761
02:23:20,200 --> 02:23:21,840
You get more than enough answers anyway.

2762
02:23:21,840 --> 02:23:24,000
Like tonight, we just had too many answers to read.

2763
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:28,840
I'd still be reading them right now, which, don't get me wrong, love you guys for participating,

2764
02:23:28,840 --> 02:23:32,800
but you know, part of it is too that I want everybody to be able to go read all the answers

2765
02:23:32,800 --> 02:23:35,840
themselves and just hear me rattle them off.

2766
02:23:35,840 --> 02:23:37,400
And three hour show.

2767
02:23:37,400 --> 02:23:38,400
Yes.

2768
02:23:38,400 --> 02:23:39,400
A three hour show.

2769
02:23:39,400 --> 02:23:40,400
Sometimes four.

2770
02:23:40,400 --> 02:23:41,800
A three hour show with news and not.

2771
02:23:41,800 --> 02:23:42,800
I don't know, Jason.

2772
02:23:42,800 --> 02:23:43,800
8.30, 8.35.

2773
02:23:43,800 --> 02:23:48,560
Tonight was, I don't know if you guys, we cut out, there's three less stories tonight

2774
02:23:48,560 --> 02:23:51,800
because it's such a slow news week, but we filled it other ways.

2775
02:23:51,800 --> 02:23:52,800
We're chatty.

2776
02:23:52,800 --> 02:23:53,800
We're chatty people.

2777
02:23:53,800 --> 02:23:54,800
Well, we do have more email.

2778
02:23:54,800 --> 02:23:55,800
Yay.

2779
02:23:55,800 --> 02:23:56,800
Speaking of chatting.

2780
02:23:56,800 --> 02:23:57,800
Hey guys.

2781
02:23:57,800 --> 02:23:58,800
Hey.

2782
02:23:58,800 --> 02:24:00,800
I don't look like a guy.

2783
02:24:00,800 --> 02:24:01,800
Anyway.

2784
02:24:01,800 --> 02:24:05,700
I've been listening to Hohler for the past few months every Monday morning at my new

2785
02:24:05,700 --> 02:24:06,700
grad job.

2786
02:24:06,700 --> 02:24:07,700
Congrats.

2787
02:24:07,700 --> 02:24:11,720
I unfortunately cannot join in the live stream often due to being on the east coast.

2788
02:24:11,720 --> 02:24:15,400
After listening to this week's podcast with the section on crowdfunded games, I was wondering

2789
02:24:15,400 --> 02:24:17,560
if you guys have looked at Star Citizen.

2790
02:24:17,560 --> 02:24:22,720
It's a new MMO space sim coming out from Chris Roberts and as of this email, it has raised

2791
02:24:22,720 --> 02:24:25,720
over 24 million through pure crowdfunding.

2792
02:24:25,720 --> 02:24:28,760
The game looks like it's going to be amazing and has a ton of backers.

2793
02:24:28,760 --> 02:24:34,280
Chris Roberts is looking to make a PC game to push the PC to its limit.

2794
02:24:34,280 --> 02:24:37,860
Check it out at robertspaceindustries.com.

2795
02:24:37,860 --> 02:24:40,860
So that's robertspaceindustries.com.

2796
02:24:40,860 --> 02:24:46,000
Anyway, thanks for the podcast and I hope to be able to join the live stream at some

2797
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:47,000
point soon.

2798
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:48,000
Duron.

2799
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:49,000
Oh, I saw that name in chat tonight.

2800
02:24:49,000 --> 02:24:50,000
So.

2801
02:24:50,000 --> 02:24:51,000
Hi Duron.

2802
02:24:51,000 --> 02:24:52,000
I'm glad you're here.

2803
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:53,000
And I'm sorry for being disgusting in part A.

2804
02:24:53,000 --> 02:24:56,720
Like I said, I was channeling extrovert.

2805
02:24:56,720 --> 02:24:57,720
You're apologizing.

2806
02:24:57,720 --> 02:25:00,920
Uh, now, uh, I, I, I'm not apologizing.

2807
02:25:00,920 --> 02:25:01,920
Am I kidding?

2808
02:25:01,920 --> 02:25:04,760
I did not recognize the game that was being discussed there, but Jason, you raised your

2809
02:25:04,760 --> 02:25:05,760
hand.

2810
02:25:05,760 --> 02:25:06,760
You were like, yes, yes.

2811
02:25:06,760 --> 02:25:07,760
I did.

2812
02:25:07,760 --> 02:25:13,940
I adore this game because wing commander is one of the few dogfights in space or air.

2813
02:25:13,940 --> 02:25:16,120
That's been absolute one of my absolute favorite series.

2814
02:25:16,120 --> 02:25:18,120
Um, for the most part.

2815
02:25:18,120 --> 02:25:24,280
Um, but Chris Roberts is, you know, every, everybody has, everybody has a one specific

2816
02:25:24,280 --> 02:25:28,200
individual that a game or a company or somebody is known for in large part.

2817
02:25:28,200 --> 02:25:31,640
And Chris Roberts is the guy for, uh, wing commander.

2818
02:25:31,640 --> 02:25:35,800
And so he's creating a space dogfight MMO.

2819
02:25:35,800 --> 02:25:37,280
No MMO has grabbed me so far.

2820
02:25:37,280 --> 02:25:45,080
I played, um, both Final Fantasy 11 and WoW to like level eight or nine on my characters.

2821
02:25:45,080 --> 02:25:48,120
A couple of days worth of playing never really went beyond that.

2822
02:25:48,120 --> 02:25:54,000
Um, but you know, MMOs have involved, have evolved in insane amount since even, since

2823
02:25:54,000 --> 02:26:00,340
even WoW came out, um, it's supposed to be full real time space dog fighting with the

2824
02:26:00,340 --> 02:26:03,120
addition of ships that you can dock on planets.

2825
02:26:03,120 --> 02:26:06,840
You can land on jump gates to go between galaxies.

2826
02:26:06,840 --> 02:26:12,520
One of the concepts that was the most interesting to me is that you won't just, it not only

2827
02:26:12,520 --> 02:26:15,780
is that they're going to make a universe, but the universe is going to continue to grow.

2828
02:26:15,780 --> 02:26:17,320
It's not going to be this finite thing.

2829
02:26:17,320 --> 02:26:22,680
There will be additional land, um, universes that you can discover planets that you can

2830
02:26:22,680 --> 02:26:23,740
travel to.

2831
02:26:23,740 --> 02:26:29,160
You can play the game passively and be a merchant commander still has a military intent, but

2832
02:26:29,160 --> 02:26:31,800
you can be like a merchant and do passive things.

2833
02:26:31,800 --> 02:26:38,640
Or you can be, uh, you know, a pirate or Confederate Raider to go in and do things for your faction.

2834
02:26:38,640 --> 02:26:40,560
It sounds expansive.

2835
02:26:40,560 --> 02:26:41,840
It sounds gripping.

2836
02:26:41,840 --> 02:26:48,880
Um, there were murmurs about Oculus support, which would be unbelievable in a 3d, you know,

2837
02:26:48,880 --> 02:26:52,640
3d universe of a game when you have, you know, all your controls in front of you in a form

2838
02:26:52,640 --> 02:26:56,880
of a joystick and however much rudder or anything, throttle, anything else that you have.

2839
02:26:56,880 --> 02:26:58,720
Um, it has sounded amazing.

2840
02:26:58,720 --> 02:27:00,680
I am a backer.

2841
02:27:00,680 --> 02:27:04,040
It's what the, the, the shirt that I got is actually one of the most comfortable shirts

2842
02:27:04,040 --> 02:27:06,080
I own right now, which is very interesting.

2843
02:27:06,080 --> 02:27:10,480
Um, but I have my, I have my badge, my ID tag.

2844
02:27:10,480 --> 02:27:13,480
Um, yeah, it's, it's looked absolutely phenomenal.

2845
02:27:13,480 --> 02:27:14,480
Hmm.

2846
02:27:14,480 --> 02:27:16,600
Or at least sometime 2014, sorry.

2847
02:27:16,600 --> 02:27:22,160
Dungeon buster said in a chat Roberts also did freelancer when he had digital anvil and

2848
02:27:22,160 --> 02:27:26,400
players essentially turned into a mini MMO with a number of mods added to it over the

2849
02:27:26,400 --> 02:27:30,920
years and Duran just said Oculus support is confirmed.

2850
02:27:30,920 --> 02:27:31,920
Nice.

2851
02:27:31,920 --> 02:27:32,920
Tim Tripp.

2852
02:27:32,920 --> 02:27:33,920
It sounds like Eve without the spreadsheets.

2853
02:27:33,920 --> 02:27:34,920
Yes.

2854
02:27:34,920 --> 02:27:35,920
That is 100% correct.

2855
02:27:36,760 --> 02:27:39,520
Uh, looking at some other comments in chat real quick, uh, on star citizen, Tim Tripp

2856
02:27:39,520 --> 02:27:44,040
says a star citizen is the only game I've ever crowdsourced and dungeon buster says

2857
02:27:44,040 --> 02:27:46,020
star citizen still on the fence with that one.

2858
02:27:46,020 --> 02:27:48,040
Not too keen on the MMO elements.

2859
02:27:48,040 --> 02:27:49,400
There you go.

2860
02:27:49,400 --> 02:27:51,400
I am moving for back into the email land.

2861
02:27:51,400 --> 02:27:53,400
We have three.

2862
02:27:53,400 --> 02:27:58,720
Hi, OLR had a fleeting thought the other day about how video games are constantly compared

2863
02:27:58,720 --> 02:28:02,440
to movies as they seem to be aligning more and more in terms of narrative and visual

2864
02:28:02,440 --> 02:28:03,440
fidelity.

2865
02:28:03,440 --> 02:28:05,440
Thank you for using fidelity in an email.

2866
02:28:05,960 --> 02:28:08,160
That makes me feel, have a little hope.

2867
02:28:08,160 --> 02:28:11,680
And there is a point of differentiation that I found interesting.

2868
02:28:11,680 --> 02:28:16,860
If a movie is considered a critical and commercial success, it's typically given many sequels.

2869
02:28:16,860 --> 02:28:21,480
With this, the original film seems more often than not become viewed as superior and pure

2870
02:28:21,480 --> 02:28:23,620
version of the franchise as a whole.

2871
02:28:23,620 --> 02:28:27,520
Why is this not the same with video games that they're so closely connected to films?

2872
02:28:27,520 --> 02:28:31,160
When a video game enjoys mass success, it is given a sequel and almost instantly original

2873
02:28:31,160 --> 02:28:35,240
game is rendered obsolete due to the improved build of the game engine, better graphics

2874
02:28:35,240 --> 02:28:36,440
control, et cetera.

2875
02:28:36,440 --> 02:28:37,840
Curious to know your thoughts on this.

2876
02:28:37,840 --> 02:28:40,880
I'm going to put in right now, I'm going to use Mass Effect as my thing, so don't judge

2877
02:28:40,880 --> 02:28:41,880
me.

2878
02:28:41,880 --> 02:28:42,880
Okay.

2879
02:28:42,880 --> 02:28:46,480
First, Mass Effect, better story wise than the later two.

2880
02:28:46,480 --> 02:28:47,480
Really?

2881
02:28:47,480 --> 02:28:50,200
I don't agree with that, but okay.

2882
02:28:50,200 --> 02:28:54,500
I think that it was when you're introducing different writing teams and the story changes

2883
02:28:54,500 --> 02:28:57,560
dramatically from the direction it was going in.

2884
02:28:57,560 --> 02:29:01,360
That's when I have some concerns.

2885
02:29:01,360 --> 02:29:06,160
But as far as playing the game, Mass Effect 3 is lots of fun.

2886
02:29:06,160 --> 02:29:11,840
I have way much more fun actually just playing the game than I do the first Mass Effect,

2887
02:29:11,840 --> 02:29:13,600
especially since the Mako makes me want to puke.

2888
02:29:13,600 --> 02:29:17,760
So if I'm understanding the question right, they want to know when the original is better

2889
02:29:17,760 --> 02:29:19,200
than the sequel.

2890
02:29:19,200 --> 02:29:24,280
Because in movies, it tends to be that the original is better than the sequel, right?

2891
02:29:24,280 --> 02:29:27,520
Very rarely are sequels as good as the original, unless you're talking about like, you know,

2892
02:29:27,520 --> 02:29:32,960
I don't know, like the Godfather, you know, Star Wars, yeah, well, Star Wars and so on.

2893
02:29:32,960 --> 02:29:37,840
A lot of times too, that when you have a movie come out, typically sequels are done, I mean,

2894
02:29:37,840 --> 02:29:42,580
except for when they're planned as trilogies, for example, Star Wars, the only three in

2895
02:29:42,580 --> 02:29:47,660
existence in my brain, in my universe, head canon.

2896
02:29:47,660 --> 02:29:52,220
Those tell a good story and they're a cohesive unit.

2897
02:29:52,340 --> 02:29:55,860
The real bill was intended to be a full movie, right?

2898
02:29:55,860 --> 02:30:00,300
And the two parts are different enough, but they are a cohesive story.

2899
02:30:00,300 --> 02:30:04,740
When you have sequels that are made as cash cows, you know, Oh, well, this movie did good.

2900
02:30:04,740 --> 02:30:07,700
Let's see if we can make some more money, hangover part two and three.

2901
02:30:07,700 --> 02:30:08,700
Yeah.

2902
02:30:08,700 --> 02:30:09,700
Right.

2903
02:30:09,700 --> 02:30:13,420
But, you know, I think like one of the few movies that have actually done that successfully

2904
02:30:13,420 --> 02:30:18,980
is like the American Pie series, those have all been kind of funny in their own bizarre

2905
02:30:18,980 --> 02:30:20,180
scream movies.

2906
02:30:20,180 --> 02:30:23,620
Not everybody likes the sequels as much as I do, but have you actually seen all of the

2907
02:30:23,620 --> 02:30:24,620
American Pies?

2908
02:30:24,620 --> 02:30:27,180
I've seen two and part of three.

2909
02:30:27,180 --> 02:30:31,100
Some of the direct to video ones are awful though.

2910
02:30:31,100 --> 02:30:32,100
Let's be real.

2911
02:30:32,100 --> 02:30:33,100
Just saying they exist.

2912
02:30:33,100 --> 02:30:35,140
Anyway, I did want to watch the band camp.

2913
02:30:35,140 --> 02:30:39,580
Let's go back to dude's question because, um, it's, or it could be female.

2914
02:30:39,580 --> 02:30:44,140
I didn't, sorry, but I don't know who, I don't know based on names, if y'all are male or

2915
02:30:44,140 --> 02:30:47,020
female, it's, it's a traditionally masculine name, but it could go the other way.

2916
02:30:47,020 --> 02:30:48,020
You never know.

2917
02:30:48,060 --> 02:30:53,740
Um, so what the emailer, um, said there, I think the question really was, have you played

2918
02:30:53,740 --> 02:30:59,740
a video game where the sequel was not as good as the original and this is, I almost used

2919
02:30:59,740 --> 02:31:01,240
this as the kickoff topic tonight.

2920
02:31:01,240 --> 02:31:04,620
The other one was a little more themed for Halloween, which, you know, but I thought

2921
02:31:04,620 --> 02:31:05,620
this is a great question too.

2922
02:31:05,620 --> 02:31:08,540
I was hoping I could hear from the three of you if there are any game series you can think

2923
02:31:08,540 --> 02:31:12,860
of where you consider the first game to be superior version despite multiple sequels.

2924
02:31:12,860 --> 02:31:17,940
Yes, I have a, uh, I had to really think about this, but I have a great answer I think for

2925
02:31:17,940 --> 02:31:18,940
this.

2926
02:31:18,940 --> 02:31:24,100
Uh, I have to go retro, really retro, but Blaster Master, the original, well, the original

2927
02:31:24,100 --> 02:31:26,860
was superior to anything that came out after it.

2928
02:31:26,860 --> 02:31:28,340
Like that horrible Genesis one.

2929
02:31:28,340 --> 02:31:30,100
But it had a better Japanese game.

2930
02:31:30,100 --> 02:31:31,660
Was it Space Fight Hyperion?

2931
02:31:31,660 --> 02:31:35,180
Yeah, but I, I, but Blaster Master was the answer that came to my mind.

2932
02:31:35,180 --> 02:31:38,300
I don't know if you guys, I had more time to think about it, but you guys.

2933
02:31:38,300 --> 02:31:39,300
Excite Truck.

2934
02:31:39,300 --> 02:31:42,100
You're on that kick again.

2935
02:31:42,100 --> 02:31:44,940
Tim Tripp actually makes a good point and this is something I was going to bring up

2936
02:31:44,940 --> 02:31:45,940
as well.

2937
02:31:45,980 --> 02:31:50,500
Typically the first game in a new IP doesn't receive the budget that an established IP.

2938
02:31:50,500 --> 02:31:54,180
So the big difference that comes in the amount of risk inherent in creating a new IP versus

2939
02:31:54,180 --> 02:31:55,780
a new movie IP.

2940
02:31:55,780 --> 02:32:01,140
Uh, I think that is a great point and I think it's very true with games, but to be fair,

2941
02:32:01,140 --> 02:32:05,420
it's also true to some extent with movies and I would point out those movies that they've

2942
02:32:05,420 --> 02:32:10,260
made a million of like, um, Saw, as much as I hate those movies, there's that, right?

2943
02:32:10,260 --> 02:32:15,540
And then there's, um, but, but, but, or sorry, Paranormal Activity.

2944
02:32:15,540 --> 02:32:17,940
You know, the first one was made for like what, a quarter?

2945
02:32:17,940 --> 02:32:21,000
Like they smashed some kid's piggy bank and made a movie with the money that was in it.

2946
02:32:21,000 --> 02:32:24,180
But then the others got like more and more budgets later on.

2947
02:32:24,180 --> 02:32:27,900
But I, but just, you know, the saw, I get a saw though, they actually do have a story

2948
02:32:27,900 --> 02:32:30,900
that goes through the whole thing, apparently, although I haven't seen the last movie, but

2949
02:32:30,900 --> 02:32:31,900
I read the Wiki.

2950
02:32:31,900 --> 02:32:34,700
I saw them all, but they actually do have a story.

2951
02:32:34,700 --> 02:32:38,100
Like once you watch them like, Oh, Hey, there actually is something that kind of ties in

2952
02:32:38,100 --> 02:32:39,100
with all this stuff.

2953
02:32:39,100 --> 02:32:40,260
I think it's one of those things.

2954
02:32:40,260 --> 02:32:42,580
Again, I only read it off the Wiki afterwards.

2955
02:32:42,580 --> 02:32:43,580
Yeah.

2956
02:32:43,620 --> 02:32:47,140
I only read the Wiki cause I refuse to watch the movies after I saw the first one and that

2957
02:32:47,140 --> 02:32:48,140
was enough.

2958
02:32:48,140 --> 02:32:50,700
Just to tell you, Shayne, I actually like Dragon Age 2 better than the first one.

2959
02:32:50,700 --> 02:32:51,940
So far, so far.

2960
02:32:51,940 --> 02:32:58,660
Oh, that's a good answer though, to the question, Dragon Age, um, the, the, I did see Saw 1

2961
02:32:58,660 --> 02:32:59,660
for whoever asked in chat.

2962
02:32:59,660 --> 02:33:01,860
I saw Saw 1, I refuse to watch any of the others.

2963
02:33:01,860 --> 02:33:05,320
I have a feeling that they always knew how it was going to end.

2964
02:33:05,320 --> 02:33:07,620
And I think they, they tied it together that way.

2965
02:33:07,620 --> 02:33:09,300
They always knew how it was going to end.

2966
02:33:09,660 --> 02:33:13,620
You know, there's a, and actually I thought about it, but someone in chat mentioned it

2967
02:33:13,620 --> 02:33:14,620
too.

2968
02:33:14,620 --> 02:33:16,220
Um, Android, is that Alan?

2969
02:33:16,220 --> 02:33:17,460
It's Alan on his phone.

2970
02:33:17,460 --> 02:33:18,460
He's on light rail right now.

2971
02:33:18,460 --> 02:33:20,980
Devil May Cry.

2972
02:33:20,980 --> 02:33:22,460
The first one was better.

2973
02:33:22,460 --> 02:33:24,540
In my opinion, I liked it a lot better.

2974
02:33:24,540 --> 02:33:29,060
Um, I can, I am also tempted to say Silent Hill.

2975
02:33:29,060 --> 02:33:33,380
I think in some ways the first game is superior to anything that came after it.

2976
02:33:33,380 --> 02:33:35,420
It's limitations actually made it creepier.

2977
02:33:35,460 --> 02:33:40,580
However, Silent Hill 2 is kind of the, the climax of that whole series.

2978
02:33:40,580 --> 02:33:43,660
And that was, I mean, yes, that's a sequel, but how many Silent Hills have there been

2979
02:33:43,660 --> 02:33:44,660
after that?

2980
02:33:44,660 --> 02:33:45,660
Too many.

2981
02:33:45,660 --> 02:33:46,660
Oh, no, no.

2982
02:33:46,660 --> 02:33:48,100
There've only been a few Silent Hill games.

2983
02:33:48,100 --> 02:33:49,100
The others are fakes.

2984
02:33:49,100 --> 02:33:50,100
Yeah.

2985
02:33:50,100 --> 02:33:51,100
Anyway.

2986
02:33:51,100 --> 02:33:52,500
They don't exist in my, in my universe.

2987
02:33:52,500 --> 02:33:53,740
That was a fantastic question.

2988
02:33:53,740 --> 02:33:58,380
I would actually invite, um, if, uh, you know, we do comments on this show every week at

2989
02:33:58,380 --> 02:34:04,060
vognetwork.com and I'd really invite you if you want to leave a comment and if your answer's

2990
02:34:04,060 --> 02:34:07,780
good, I will get, or like, you know, of course, Shane pipes in.

2991
02:34:07,780 --> 02:34:11,380
I'll be very easy on you with this, but, um, I'll give you a thumbs up guaranteed.

2992
02:34:11,380 --> 02:34:14,500
So you get a little point on vognetwork.com.

2993
02:34:14,500 --> 02:34:17,940
If you have an answer to this question, leave it on the episode posting at vognetwork.com

2994
02:34:17,940 --> 02:34:18,940
for you podcast listeners.

2995
02:34:18,940 --> 02:34:23,660
Cause I want to know what games do you believe had better initial games than the sequels?

2996
02:34:23,660 --> 02:34:27,500
See Shane ranks the Silent Hill games as two, four, one, three.

2997
02:34:27,500 --> 02:34:28,500
I beg to differ.

2998
02:34:28,500 --> 02:34:29,500
Hmm.

2999
02:34:29,500 --> 02:34:30,500
Three, two, four, one.

3000
02:34:30,500 --> 02:34:31,500
Now take that.

3001
02:34:31,500 --> 02:34:32,500
Three, two, one, four.

3002
02:34:32,900 --> 02:34:38,900
Shane, Shane, admittedly, you value the room way more than a lot of people do.

3003
02:34:38,900 --> 02:34:40,740
The room wasn't supposed to be a Silent Hill game.

3004
02:34:40,740 --> 02:34:41,740
Oh, remember?

3005
02:34:41,740 --> 02:34:42,740
Anyway.

3006
02:34:42,740 --> 02:34:46,020
I loved the, I liked the room, the three booths that they had for that game.

3007
02:34:46,020 --> 02:34:47,020
Yeah.

3008
02:34:47,020 --> 02:34:48,340
That was my first, like the kitchen and everything.

3009
02:34:48,340 --> 02:34:49,340
Oh my God.

3010
02:34:49,340 --> 02:34:50,340
That was awesome.

3011
02:34:50,340 --> 02:34:52,940
So, um, yeah, we still have more email.

3012
02:34:52,940 --> 02:34:53,940
Yay.

3013
02:34:53,940 --> 02:34:56,020
This is, we didn't need three extra stories.

3014
02:34:56,020 --> 02:34:57,980
We've got three extra emails tonight and that's fine.

3015
02:34:57,980 --> 02:34:58,980
Every gamer gets a voice.

3016
02:34:58,980 --> 02:34:59,980
Hey guys.

3017
02:34:59,980 --> 02:35:00,980
Hey guys.

3018
02:35:00,980 --> 02:35:01,980
Starlock here.

3019
02:35:01,980 --> 02:35:02,980
Hi Starlock.

3020
02:35:02,980 --> 02:35:08,740
With Halloween mere days away, I had a question to pose to both the host and listeners.

3021
02:35:08,740 --> 02:35:13,180
I wanted to know what game you can't finish due to one scene that spoils the rest of the

3022
02:35:13,180 --> 02:35:14,180
game for you.

3023
02:35:14,180 --> 02:35:17,500
I'll give you my example near the beginning of Homefront.

3024
02:35:17,500 --> 02:35:20,500
There's a scene in which the child's parents are killed right in front of him and the child

3025
02:35:20,500 --> 02:35:22,620
is seen crying for several seconds.

3026
02:35:22,620 --> 02:35:26,700
Even though I'm fairly certain no other such scenes exist in the game, it completely kills

3027
02:35:26,700 --> 02:35:30,540
the desire for me to see the rest of the game because that scene is just too disturbing

3028
02:35:30,540 --> 02:35:31,620
for me to watch.

3029
02:35:31,620 --> 02:35:35,380
I wanted to know if anyone else had similar experiences with any games out there.

3030
02:35:35,380 --> 02:35:36,380
Keep being awesome, Starlock.

3031
02:35:36,380 --> 02:35:38,460
There's a movie that does that for me.

3032
02:35:38,460 --> 02:35:41,260
I can't watch Face Off.

3033
02:35:41,260 --> 02:35:45,620
I never played more than Silent, than the start of Silent Hill 4 because the opening

3034
02:35:45,620 --> 02:35:50,140
cinematic and the ambience just kind of completely creeped me out.

3035
02:35:50,140 --> 02:35:54,140
I think my head was just kind of in a weird place that afternoon and I think I literally

3036
02:35:54,140 --> 02:35:58,540
just finished Silent Hill 3 and moved on to Silent Hill 4, but I saw the opening cinematic

3037
02:35:58,540 --> 02:36:01,340
which did the whole world shifting.

3038
02:36:01,340 --> 02:36:05,580
I did start the game, I did get control, I went to the window and I looked outside and

3039
02:36:05,580 --> 02:36:11,140
saw the other apartment across the way, whatever, but I never touched the game beyond that because

3040
02:36:11,140 --> 02:36:17,900
for whatever reason the ambience just seemed too much for my brain and I put it down and

3041
02:36:17,900 --> 02:36:21,540
never picked it back up again.

3042
02:36:21,540 --> 02:36:25,300
If my name was Bobby Blackwell, I might say, well, I played the demo to Ni No Kuni and

3043
02:36:25,300 --> 02:36:29,740
then that scared me off for the rest of the game.

3044
02:36:29,740 --> 02:36:33,100
I can only think of a funny answer because I can't think of a serious one because I didn't

3045
02:36:33,100 --> 02:36:34,100
see this email in advance.

3046
02:36:34,100 --> 02:36:36,660
It must have come in late.

3047
02:36:36,660 --> 02:36:37,660
I really don't know.

3048
02:36:37,660 --> 02:36:38,660
A game where a scene...

3049
02:36:38,660 --> 02:36:41,180
Does it have to be disturbing or just it was bad?

3050
02:36:41,180 --> 02:36:43,540
Like there was something so bad happen?

3051
02:36:43,540 --> 02:36:44,540
Question.

3052
02:36:44,540 --> 02:36:47,460
Well, disturbing, bad, something that affected you in a way that made you not want to finish

3053
02:36:47,460 --> 02:36:50,900
it.

3054
02:36:50,900 --> 02:36:54,540
It's like me in the scene in legend that I can't get past and have never finished the

3055
02:36:54,540 --> 02:36:55,540
movie.

3056
02:36:55,540 --> 02:36:56,540
Oh yeah.

3057
02:36:56,540 --> 02:36:57,540
You know what I'm talking about?

3058
02:36:57,540 --> 02:36:58,540
Yeah, I know I do.

3059
02:36:58,540 --> 02:37:03,120
And I'm trying to think if I have anything that's kind of like trigger-ish like that.

3060
02:37:03,120 --> 02:37:05,580
And for the record, I don't think I could play the game for exactly the same reason

3061
02:37:05,580 --> 02:37:08,820
because it's kind of a very horrible thing for me.

3062
02:37:08,820 --> 02:37:09,900
I can't think of something.

3063
02:37:09,900 --> 02:37:13,780
If I think of something, I'll have to answer it on VOG Network or something because I really

3064
02:37:13,780 --> 02:37:14,780
can't think of anything.

3065
02:37:14,780 --> 02:37:17,240
Loki, can you think of anything that...

3066
02:37:17,240 --> 02:37:19,960
When you put in the Excitebots and found it wasn't it's like track?

3067
02:37:19,960 --> 02:37:27,480
Yeah, it was the first Mexico track and you're playing it and then the game asks you to throw

3068
02:37:27,480 --> 02:37:28,640
a pie at a clown.

3069
02:37:28,640 --> 02:37:32,680
I was like, what the fuck is this?

3070
02:37:32,680 --> 02:37:35,960
I can't think of anything that's really had a scene in the game that kind of ruined it

3071
02:37:35,960 --> 02:37:36,960
for me.

3072
02:37:36,960 --> 02:37:43,800
I can think of a lot of games where you play through it and the end is like kind of lame.

3073
02:37:43,800 --> 02:37:45,200
And that kind of ruined it for me.

3074
02:37:45,200 --> 02:37:47,040
It's like, shit, why did I play this game?

3075
02:37:47,040 --> 02:37:49,800
This ending is fucking terrible.

3076
02:37:49,800 --> 02:37:53,000
But no, I can't think of anything that's like there's been something in the middle of the

3077
02:37:53,000 --> 02:37:56,520
game, like a story thing where it just kind of went, what?

3078
02:37:56,520 --> 02:37:57,720
I don't like this.

3079
02:37:57,720 --> 02:38:01,160
I'm going to quit this game.

3080
02:38:01,160 --> 02:38:03,940
Tim Tripp in chat says, I watched The Descent once.

3081
02:38:03,940 --> 02:38:07,040
It was amazing, but I can never watch it again.

3082
02:38:07,040 --> 02:38:10,800
I've definitely seen a lot of movies like that where it's like, I'm glad I saw it once

3083
02:38:10,800 --> 02:38:12,440
and I will never watch that again.

3084
02:38:12,440 --> 02:38:15,580
I have a movie I can say I wasn't glad that I saw it even though I didn't have to pay

3085
02:38:15,580 --> 02:38:16,580
for it.

3086
02:38:16,620 --> 02:38:17,620
And that was Drag Me to Hell.

3087
02:38:17,620 --> 02:38:19,420
I went with Tiara to see it.

3088
02:38:19,420 --> 02:38:20,420
She loved it.

3089
02:38:20,420 --> 02:38:23,020
I just thought it was gross and not very good.

3090
02:38:23,020 --> 02:38:24,900
Watched movie 43 the other day.

3091
02:38:24,900 --> 02:38:29,180
Very disappointed that that movie was not funny or it wasn't as.

3092
02:38:29,180 --> 02:38:31,980
They showed you all the funny stuff in the trailer.

3093
02:38:31,980 --> 02:38:36,980
It did have a cameo, though, of Band Fuse, a game that will unfortunately sorely fail

3094
02:38:36,980 --> 02:38:40,380
when it comes out in November, but it had a cameo.

3095
02:38:40,380 --> 02:38:42,380
So there's a bullet point for that.

3096
02:38:42,380 --> 02:38:44,660
I'm trying to see if the chatters have any.

3097
02:38:44,660 --> 02:38:46,420
They're still doing the Silent Hill debate in chat.

3098
02:38:46,420 --> 02:38:49,940
There's not a lot of comments on it, but Dungeon Buster does say I couldn't get past

3099
02:38:49,940 --> 02:38:52,940
the bad full motion video acting in a PC game once.

3100
02:38:52,940 --> 02:38:55,940
Well, the gameplay was also pretty terrible, too, but he didn't say what game it was.

3101
02:38:55,940 --> 02:38:57,980
So I don't know.

3102
02:38:57,980 --> 02:39:01,460
But chatters, if you have any answers to it, let us know.

3103
02:39:01,460 --> 02:39:04,860
There was a game that I remember playing for a while that had something that made me super

3104
02:39:04,860 --> 02:39:07,900
nauseous and I couldn't touch the game for a little while.

3105
02:39:07,900 --> 02:39:08,900
But then I went back.

3106
02:39:08,900 --> 02:39:14,380
I mean, I've had things that they just shake me up right away and I'd have trouble finishing

3107
02:39:14,380 --> 02:39:16,220
the scene.

3108
02:39:16,220 --> 02:39:20,660
And then once I'd digested it for a few days, I could go back and play it and be fine.

3109
02:39:20,660 --> 02:39:21,860
But I can't remember the last one.

3110
02:39:21,860 --> 02:39:27,140
I kind of didn't like the beginning of Alone in the Dark, the original Alone in the Dark,

3111
02:39:27,140 --> 02:39:28,860
because it was hard.

3112
02:39:28,860 --> 02:39:29,860
That's about it.

3113
02:39:29,860 --> 02:39:30,860
I don't know.

3114
02:39:30,860 --> 02:39:31,860
Once again, nothing content-related.

3115
02:39:31,860 --> 02:39:37,500
I mean, fuck, there was the torture scene Grand Theft Auto 5 and I was just like, how

3116
02:39:37,500 --> 02:39:43,140
do I gold this thing because I don't want to have to play this boring minigame again.

3117
02:39:44,140 --> 02:39:47,260
Oh yeah, that's kind of brutal too, I guess.

3118
02:39:47,260 --> 02:39:48,260
All right.

3119
02:39:48,260 --> 02:39:50,700
Well, if I think of something later, I'll let you know.

3120
02:39:50,700 --> 02:39:51,700
That was a good question, though.

3121
02:39:51,700 --> 02:39:52,700
Okay.

3122
02:39:52,700 --> 02:39:53,700
Last email.

3123
02:39:53,700 --> 02:39:54,700
I believe it's last.

3124
02:39:54,700 --> 02:39:56,060
It's the last, as far as I'm concerned.

3125
02:39:56,060 --> 02:39:57,060
Last for tonight.

3126
02:39:57,060 --> 02:39:58,460
Hi folks, it's Raginator.

3127
02:39:58,460 --> 02:40:03,100
Seeing as tonight's episode is the last one before Halloween is spelled with an A, dude.

3128
02:40:03,100 --> 02:40:04,100
Halloween.

3129
02:40:04,100 --> 02:40:05,100
Halloween.

3130
02:40:05,100 --> 02:40:07,180
You spelled it twice.

3131
02:40:07,180 --> 02:40:09,620
You spelled it Halloween.

3132
02:40:09,620 --> 02:40:12,620
Hollow Man is a very good, okay.

3133
02:40:13,100 --> 02:40:14,100
It's a movie that came to me.

3134
02:40:14,100 --> 02:40:15,100
I thought I'd send out Halloween.

3135
02:40:15,100 --> 02:40:17,100
It is All Hallows Eve.

3136
02:40:17,100 --> 02:40:18,100
Hallo.

3137
02:40:18,100 --> 02:40:19,100
Hallo.

3138
02:40:19,100 --> 02:40:24,340
I know that since we're all pretty much in the same age group, around 35 plus or minus

3139
02:40:24,340 --> 02:40:27,420
six years, we don't...

3140
02:40:27,420 --> 02:40:28,420
We are, Raginator.

3141
02:40:28,420 --> 02:40:30,300
I don't know about the listeners, but okay.

3142
02:40:30,300 --> 02:40:32,020
We all don't go trick or treating anymore.

3143
02:40:32,020 --> 02:40:33,020
Yes, we do.

3144
02:40:33,020 --> 02:40:34,020
And haven't done so in years.

3145
02:40:34,020 --> 02:40:35,020
Yes, we have.

3146
02:40:35,020 --> 02:40:36,020
Fuck that shit.

3147
02:40:36,020 --> 02:40:38,440
The Disneyland party is off the hook.

3148
02:40:38,440 --> 02:40:42,580
And for the record, some of us might have kids, so they go trick or treating.

3149
02:40:42,580 --> 02:40:43,580
With their kids.

3150
02:40:43,580 --> 02:40:45,580
Who do you think eats all the candy in the middle of the night?

3151
02:40:45,580 --> 02:40:46,580
Mom!

3152
02:40:46,580 --> 02:40:47,580
Loki.

3153
02:40:47,580 --> 02:40:48,580
I don't eat all the candy.

3154
02:40:48,580 --> 02:40:49,580
I just go to Becky's house and take Julian's.

3155
02:40:49,580 --> 02:40:50,580
My wife would be in there.

3156
02:40:50,580 --> 02:40:54,120
I mean, Becky, if you're listening, I'm not going to steal Julian's candy.

3157
02:40:54,120 --> 02:40:56,220
If you're listening, I'm not going to take Julian's candy.

3158
02:40:56,220 --> 02:40:57,220
Yes.

3159
02:40:57,220 --> 02:40:58,220
No.

3160
02:40:58,220 --> 02:40:59,660
Besides, they keep giving him those stupid peanut butter cups.

3161
02:40:59,660 --> 02:41:02,280
Those things fucking suck.

3162
02:41:02,280 --> 02:41:03,280
My opinion, of course.

3163
02:41:03,280 --> 02:41:04,280
Everyone else likes peanut butter cups.

3164
02:41:04,280 --> 02:41:05,280
I know.

3165
02:41:05,280 --> 02:41:06,280
I know whatever.

3166
02:41:06,280 --> 02:41:07,280
Everyone else likes that shit, but not me.

3167
02:41:07,280 --> 02:41:09,100
And to continue, God, you keep misspelling Halloween.

3168
02:41:09,100 --> 02:41:10,740
God, this is fucking irritating.

3169
02:41:10,740 --> 02:41:13,940
But we may have certain Halloween traditions.

3170
02:41:13,940 --> 02:41:16,420
For me, it's watching movies that would be Halloween appropriate.

3171
02:41:16,420 --> 02:41:18,100
Alien, Aliens, Monster Squad.

3172
02:41:18,100 --> 02:41:19,820
God, I fucking love the Monster Squad.

3173
02:41:19,820 --> 02:41:20,820
Showgirls.

3174
02:41:20,820 --> 02:41:21,820
Girl.

3175
02:41:21,820 --> 02:41:22,820
Fist bump.

3176
02:41:22,820 --> 02:41:23,820
Ghostbusters, etc.

3177
02:41:23,820 --> 02:41:25,820
You are a whore, darlin'.

3178
02:41:25,820 --> 02:41:27,420
Y'all know shit.

3179
02:41:27,420 --> 02:41:32,620
I could do the hand thing, but I'm holding a mic.

3180
02:41:32,620 --> 02:41:34,500
And the same goes with games.

3181
02:41:34,500 --> 02:41:36,620
Nightmare Creatures, Resident Evil 1-3-3, blah.

3182
02:41:36,620 --> 02:41:37,620
I mean, etc.

3183
02:41:37,620 --> 02:41:43,860
Now my question for you is, do you do anything at all similar?

3184
02:41:43,860 --> 02:41:48,100
I sit at home and throw candy at kids.

3185
02:41:48,100 --> 02:41:49,580
I don't know about this year.

3186
02:41:49,580 --> 02:41:51,260
We're going to something.

3187
02:41:51,260 --> 02:41:55,140
I know a lot of people did their Halloween party this weekend, like last night, but we

3188
02:41:55,140 --> 02:41:59,500
got invited to one that's after Halloween, so we're doing that, and my costume that we

3189
02:41:59,500 --> 02:42:02,440
bought the other day is for that.

3190
02:42:02,440 --> 02:42:06,780
But I don't know about on Halloween itself this year.

3191
02:42:06,940 --> 02:42:08,940
Maybe I'll try to invite some people over to watch Showgirls.

3192
02:42:08,940 --> 02:42:09,940
It'll be fun.

3193
02:42:09,940 --> 02:42:11,700
Or I'll go to Jamie's.

3194
02:42:11,700 --> 02:42:12,700
You know what?

3195
02:42:12,700 --> 02:42:13,700
I seriously want to do that.

3196
02:42:13,700 --> 02:42:15,340
You're not doing anything on Halloween, right?

3197
02:42:15,340 --> 02:42:16,700
Is your thing on Halloween?

3198
02:42:16,700 --> 02:42:17,700
Not yet.

3199
02:42:17,700 --> 02:42:18,700
No, it's on, like, the second.

3200
02:42:18,700 --> 02:42:19,700
That's at Showgirls' party at my house.

3201
02:42:19,700 --> 02:42:20,700
Fuck yes.

3202
02:42:20,700 --> 02:42:23,700
We'll just push everything out of the room.

3203
02:42:23,700 --> 02:42:27,100
Can I bring over a kiddie pool and we'll reenact the pool scene with the cats?

3204
02:42:27,100 --> 02:42:28,100
Yes!

3205
02:42:28,100 --> 02:42:29,100
I don't know.

3206
02:42:29,100 --> 02:42:30,100
Midna might bite me.

3207
02:42:30,100 --> 02:42:31,100
I don't.

3208
02:42:31,100 --> 02:42:32,100
Alright.

3209
02:42:32,100 --> 02:42:38,220
No, but, actually, I'm totally down for Showgirls at my house on Halloween.

3210
02:42:38,220 --> 02:42:40,620
You really shouldn't throttle cats like that.

3211
02:42:40,620 --> 02:42:41,620
With mimosas.

3212
02:42:41,620 --> 02:42:42,620
Rob.

3213
02:42:42,620 --> 02:42:45,620
Well, I have to drive home, but.

3214
02:42:45,620 --> 02:42:47,420
I have a couch.

3215
02:42:47,420 --> 02:42:49,100
I gotta work on Friday, girl.

3216
02:42:49,100 --> 02:42:50,100
Girl.

3217
02:42:50,100 --> 02:42:51,100
No.

3218
02:42:51,100 --> 02:42:54,060
Okay, we have mimosas early and then you can, you know, work it off doing the hand wave.

3219
02:42:54,060 --> 02:42:55,060
Alright, alright, read the email.

3220
02:42:55,060 --> 02:42:56,060
Two things.

3221
02:42:56,060 --> 02:42:57,060
That was the email.

3222
02:42:57,060 --> 02:42:58,060
Two random thoughts I just had here.

3223
02:42:58,060 --> 02:42:59,060
Sure.

3224
02:42:59,060 --> 02:43:00,060
Why not?

3225
02:43:00,060 --> 02:43:01,060
Both Showgirls, really.

3226
02:43:01,100 --> 02:43:04,180
Any sort of Kickstarter related game that has to do with Showgirls.

3227
02:43:04,180 --> 02:43:08,820
Perhaps like, you know, a WarioWare type situation where you have all these different mini games

3228
02:43:08,820 --> 02:43:10,500
that have to do with Showgirls.

3229
02:43:10,500 --> 02:43:14,820
And two, I just thought, remember they have that really retarded jib-jab type or whatever

3230
02:43:14,820 --> 02:43:16,220
where you can put your face on stuff?

3231
02:43:16,220 --> 02:43:19,460
They really need to put scenes from Showgirls in there where you can just put your face

3232
02:43:19,460 --> 02:43:20,460
on those characters.

3233
02:43:20,460 --> 02:43:21,460
That'd be hilarious.

3234
02:43:21,460 --> 02:43:22,460
Oh my god.

3235
02:43:22,460 --> 02:43:23,460
You know what I just remembered?

3236
02:43:23,460 --> 02:43:24,460
It would be leotardid.

3237
02:43:24,460 --> 02:43:25,460
Lowkey.

3238
02:43:25,460 --> 02:43:26,460
You know what I just remembered?

3239
02:43:26,460 --> 02:43:27,460
Totally leotardid.

3240
02:43:27,460 --> 02:43:28,460
You know all I know about jib-jab?

3241
02:43:28,460 --> 02:43:29,460
Uh huh.

3242
02:43:29,460 --> 02:43:30,460
Is that this land thing that was made with Romney and Bush?

3243
02:43:30,860 --> 02:43:33,460
I don't see those god-awful Christmas cards singing elf things on Facebook.

3244
02:43:33,460 --> 02:43:35,020
I don't look at that shit.

3245
02:43:35,020 --> 02:43:39,360
The management at my work think those are so clever.

3246
02:43:39,360 --> 02:43:40,360
Every fucking year.

3247
02:43:40,360 --> 02:43:44,020
All I know of jib-jab is the year that they did this land featuring, um, not Romney, what

3248
02:43:44,020 --> 02:43:45,020
I'm saying.

3249
02:43:45,020 --> 02:43:48,180
Um, who was the guy that ran against Bush that we all knew would lose?

3250
02:43:48,180 --> 02:43:49,180
Gore?

3251
02:43:49,180 --> 02:43:50,180
No.

3252
02:43:50,180 --> 02:43:51,180
Um, John Kerry.

3253
02:43:51,180 --> 02:43:52,180
John Kerry.

3254
02:43:52,180 --> 02:43:54,180
You're the guy who, like, an int.

3255
02:43:54,180 --> 02:43:55,180
Yes.

3256
02:43:55,180 --> 02:43:56,180
Yeah.

3257
02:43:56,180 --> 02:43:57,180
Um, yeah.

3258
02:43:57,180 --> 02:43:58,180
That was pretty funny.

3259
02:43:58,180 --> 02:43:59,180
Alright.

3260
02:43:59,220 --> 02:44:03,220
I'm going to chatroom at live.vognetware.com, uh, Tim Tripp suggests a Kinect-based showgirls

3261
02:44:03,220 --> 02:44:04,220
dance game.

3262
02:44:04,220 --> 02:44:07,540
Uh, D'Artezia said, do they do shadowcasts of showgirls?

3263
02:44:07,540 --> 02:44:08,540
Just wondering.

3264
02:44:08,540 --> 02:44:09,540
No.

3265
02:44:09,540 --> 02:44:12,980
And by the way, this is like the third time this year showgirls has come up on the show,

3266
02:44:12,980 --> 02:44:14,420
which has nothing to do with video games.

3267
02:44:14,420 --> 02:44:17,920
I guess that's what makes our show unique, if you can tolerate this chat.

3268
02:44:17,920 --> 02:44:21,540
But I will entertain this question because the one thing I look forward to every year

3269
02:44:21,540 --> 02:44:27,600
in August is at the Castro Theater in San Francisco, California, the drag queen peaches

3270
02:44:27,640 --> 02:44:33,440
Christ and her, yes, that's her name, peaches Christ and her crew put on a midnight showing

3271
02:44:33,440 --> 02:44:35,720
or no, I guess it's the peaches Christ midnight mass.

3272
02:44:35,720 --> 02:44:38,220
I guess they bumped it up a little bit cause we're all getting older.

3273
02:44:38,220 --> 02:44:43,660
It's more like this 8 p.m. showing of showgirls and the bitch comes out of a volcano and they

3274
02:44:43,660 --> 02:44:46,180
all do the dance to goddess and the whole thing.

3275
02:44:46,180 --> 02:44:48,600
And then they do free lap dances with large popcorn.

3276
02:44:48,600 --> 02:44:52,080
And for like the past four or five years, um, Alan and I have been going religiously

3277
02:44:52,080 --> 02:44:53,080
this thing.

3278
02:44:53,080 --> 02:44:54,480
I want to go with you guys next year.

3279
02:44:54,480 --> 02:44:55,480
You came one time.

3280
02:44:55,480 --> 02:44:57,360
I came once, but I didn't get to go this last year.

3281
02:44:57,360 --> 02:45:02,520
I went the year before because we went to a sausage factory, which is a restaurant in

3282
02:45:02,520 --> 02:45:03,520
the Castro.

3283
02:45:03,520 --> 02:45:04,520
Go figure.

3284
02:45:04,520 --> 02:45:08,840
But yes, uh, I pretty much live for that day of the year because I love showgirls and by

3285
02:45:08,840 --> 02:45:13,600
the way, Elizabeth Berkeley on dancing with the stars watching me live.

3286
02:45:13,600 --> 02:45:16,280
Did you see the I'm so excited dance?

3287
02:45:16,280 --> 02:45:17,280
I know, right?

3288
02:45:17,280 --> 02:45:18,280
I don't even watch that show.

3289
02:45:18,280 --> 02:45:19,280
And I watched that.

3290
02:45:19,280 --> 02:45:21,360
Oh, I was like, even Loki saw it.

3291
02:45:21,360 --> 02:45:22,360
You didn't see it.

3292
02:45:22,360 --> 02:45:23,360
Oh, she did.

3293
02:45:23,360 --> 02:45:25,240
You remember saved by the bell, right?

3294
02:45:25,240 --> 02:45:28,880
I didn't even watch saved by the bell and I know that she did a dance related to that

3295
02:45:28,880 --> 02:45:30,400
and they actually like had scenery.

3296
02:45:30,400 --> 02:45:31,400
Yeah.

3297
02:45:31,400 --> 02:45:32,880
She was taking, she was ODing on jive pills.

3298
02:45:32,880 --> 02:45:34,520
It was great.

3299
02:45:34,520 --> 02:45:36,360
And the dance was of course the jive.

3300
02:45:36,360 --> 02:45:43,080
Although I will say this, the best person to ever do the jive on that show was, um,

3301
02:45:43,080 --> 02:45:44,080
Stacy Keebler.

3302
02:45:44,080 --> 02:45:48,760
Just saying, I'll have to look it up, I guess.

3303
02:45:48,760 --> 02:45:49,760
All right.

3304
02:45:49,760 --> 02:45:51,640
Uh, is that it for mailbag?

3305
02:45:51,640 --> 02:45:52,640
It is for now.

3306
02:45:52,640 --> 02:45:53,640
All right.

3307
02:45:53,640 --> 02:45:54,640
Then there you go.

3308
02:45:55,040 --> 02:45:58,320
The next part of the show with the FUs of the week, we get a little angst out of our

3309
02:45:58,320 --> 02:45:59,320
system.

3310
02:45:59,320 --> 02:46:00,320
Why?

3311
02:46:00,320 --> 02:46:01,320
Because

3312
02:46:01,320 --> 02:46:23,880
FU to my state of unemployment again, I'm, I really want this job that I interviewed

3313
02:46:23,880 --> 02:46:28,560
for, it seems like such a great match.

3314
02:46:28,560 --> 02:46:29,840
I hate getting my hopes up too.

3315
02:46:29,840 --> 02:46:36,160
So FU to getting my hopes up because the last few times I've been pretty dashed, but I,

3316
02:46:36,160 --> 02:46:39,120
I feel really positively, I haven't heard anything back yet.

3317
02:46:39,120 --> 02:46:46,840
So FU to the anticipation, FU to the waiting room, and I really, really want this to be

3318
02:46:46,840 --> 02:46:47,840
successful.

3319
02:46:47,840 --> 02:46:49,480
I'd really like this job.

3320
02:46:49,480 --> 02:46:51,480
It would be perfect.

3321
02:46:51,480 --> 02:46:52,520
Perfect.

3322
02:46:52,520 --> 02:46:58,400
And also FU to getting oil paint all over my arm and looking like I've punched a wall.

3323
02:46:58,400 --> 02:47:06,280
I'm painting, um, a portrait in purple and blue or violet and blue and blue violet.

3324
02:47:06,280 --> 02:47:11,120
And I got blue and blue violet all over my right arm going down the bone and it looked

3325
02:47:11,120 --> 02:47:14,520
like I had just hit a wall with the side of my arm.

3326
02:47:14,520 --> 02:47:18,600
So FU to oil paint as well.

3327
02:47:18,600 --> 02:47:20,280
And Rob just came up with a nephew.

3328
02:47:20,280 --> 02:47:25,620
Yeah, I'm going next because I, I will FU to the headache that I just went to the bathroom

3329
02:47:25,620 --> 02:47:29,600
to get Advil for my headache and then FU to the fact that I stubbed my toe on the way

3330
02:47:29,600 --> 02:47:30,600
back.

3331
02:47:30,600 --> 02:47:31,600
It fucking hurts.

3332
02:47:31,600 --> 02:47:32,600
Do you want ice?

3333
02:47:32,600 --> 02:47:33,600
No.

3334
02:47:33,600 --> 02:47:34,600
Kiss it, make it better.

3335
02:47:34,600 --> 02:47:35,600
Eh.

3336
02:47:35,600 --> 02:47:36,600
Loki, what's your FU?

3337
02:47:36,600 --> 02:47:38,680
We'll get the kitty to kiss it.

3338
02:47:38,680 --> 02:47:39,960
Kitty kisses make it all better.

3339
02:47:39,960 --> 02:47:42,160
She's hiding under the bed cause she hates people.

3340
02:47:42,160 --> 02:47:47,940
My FU goes to the city of Folsom and their wonderful event that they had on Friday, their

3341
02:47:47,940 --> 02:47:51,800
Night of a Thousand Pumpkins, which I, see I don't go down the old Folsom because it's

3342
02:47:51,800 --> 02:47:57,820
like this hipster, you know, historic area that they do events in and stuff like that.

3343
02:47:57,820 --> 02:48:00,300
What a bunch of douche bags coming out of there.

3344
02:48:00,300 --> 02:48:05,100
Anyways, but seriously though, they had their thing and see I, I don't do that, but free

3345
02:48:05,100 --> 02:48:07,000
trick or treating and stuff like that.

3346
02:48:07,000 --> 02:48:09,420
They charge parking down there.

3347
02:48:09,420 --> 02:48:14,160
Normally the parking garage is free, but they charge $2 parking for charity.

3348
02:48:14,160 --> 02:48:18,860
The charity happens to be the Folsom Historic Society, basically they run this really shitty

3349
02:48:18,860 --> 02:48:22,440
museum that they have down there that no one fucking goes to and is closed every time I

3350
02:48:22,440 --> 02:48:23,440
go down there.

3351
02:48:23,440 --> 02:48:28,360
So fuck them for that because then I had to go, I had to first off look for parking that

3352
02:48:28,360 --> 02:48:29,740
didn't cost any money.

3353
02:48:29,740 --> 02:48:34,880
Then I had to drive across the bridge to a gas station to use an ATM to get fucking money

3354
02:48:34,880 --> 02:48:40,960
to pay their stupid fee to then park on the roof of this stupid, it was just terrible.

3355
02:48:41,000 --> 02:48:43,800
And the event sucked on top of all of that.

3356
02:48:43,800 --> 02:48:48,000
So you did just give an F you to a $2 charity donation you had to make?

3357
02:48:48,000 --> 02:48:49,000
Yes.

3358
02:48:49,000 --> 02:48:51,000
Just making sure.

3359
02:48:51,000 --> 02:48:52,000
Jason!

3360
02:48:52,000 --> 02:48:57,200
F you to myself for not just, for not being able to just get on a fricking plane.

3361
02:48:57,200 --> 02:49:03,720
It's not hard to get around places and save me a hell of a lot of time in grief.

3362
02:49:03,720 --> 02:49:07,960
I don't mind driving, but some days, whatever.

3363
02:49:08,960 --> 02:49:11,960
Um, and there was a second one.

3364
02:49:11,960 --> 02:49:14,960
F you to money in general.

3365
02:49:14,960 --> 02:49:15,960
I hear that.

3366
02:49:15,960 --> 02:49:16,960
I hear that.

3367
02:49:16,960 --> 02:49:19,960
All right, there it is, the F yous of the week.

3368
02:49:19,960 --> 02:49:20,960
So angsty, so fresh.

3369
02:49:20,960 --> 02:49:21,960
All right.

3370
02:49:21,960 --> 02:49:23,960
Uh, just a few more stories for you guys.

3371
02:49:23,960 --> 02:49:27,960
An F you to misspelling Halloween.

3372
02:49:27,960 --> 02:49:29,960
Poor Ragenator, but then again, we've been picking on that guy forever.

3373
02:49:29,960 --> 02:49:30,960
We still love you, Ragenator.

3374
02:49:30,960 --> 02:49:34,960
Bones did it too, but I'm just being, I just use it as a launch.

3375
02:49:34,960 --> 02:49:36,960
Blame autocorrect.

3376
02:49:36,960 --> 02:49:37,960
That's what people do.

3377
02:49:37,960 --> 02:49:38,960
All right.

3378
02:49:38,960 --> 02:49:40,960
How is that even an autocorrect thing?

3379
02:49:40,960 --> 02:49:42,960
Because it's misspelled.

3380
02:49:42,960 --> 02:49:43,960
Shouldn't autocorrect catch that?

3381
02:49:43,960 --> 02:49:44,960
Calm down, Lee.

3382
02:49:44,960 --> 02:49:49,760
That would be hilarious to like change someone's autocorrect to like wrong stuff.

3383
02:49:49,760 --> 02:49:50,760
It learns.

3384
02:49:50,760 --> 02:49:51,760
Dude.

3385
02:49:51,760 --> 02:49:52,760
Yeah.

3386
02:49:52,760 --> 02:49:57,140
My phone knows like when I start to type L-U-V, it goes, love you, mean it.

3387
02:49:57,140 --> 02:49:58,760
Like it knows that that's a word.

3388
02:49:58,760 --> 02:50:01,160
I want to know how my iPad gets all these things wrong.

3389
02:50:01,160 --> 02:50:03,160
It knows fuckery as a word now.

3390
02:50:03,160 --> 02:50:05,160
My phone knows and ass hattery.

3391
02:50:06,160 --> 02:50:10,160
By the way, I have to go with Quincemia down with capitalism.

3392
02:50:10,160 --> 02:50:15,160
I will say my phone always picks either we're or were wrong and it's actually kind of really

3393
02:50:15,160 --> 02:50:16,160
annoying.

3394
02:50:16,160 --> 02:50:20,160
I do have OMW turn automatically into on my way.

3395
02:50:20,160 --> 02:50:21,160
Everybody does by default.

3396
02:50:21,160 --> 02:50:23,160
Jason, some flight advice from Shane.

3397
02:50:23,160 --> 02:50:24,160
I changed the punctuation.

3398
02:50:24,160 --> 02:50:27,160
From Shane Olinko in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

3399
02:50:27,160 --> 02:50:30,160
Jason, if you're afraid to fly, ask for vodka on the plane.

3400
02:50:30,160 --> 02:50:34,160
I told a flight attendant I was scared and she gave me vodka and orange juice and it

3401
02:50:34,160 --> 02:50:36,160
made the flight super fun.

3402
02:50:38,160 --> 02:50:43,160
I've gotten a lot of similar remedy ideas that and well, I'm sure we can fill in the

3403
02:50:43,160 --> 02:50:44,160
blank.

3404
02:50:44,160 --> 02:50:49,160
Doesn't one of those airlines like Virgin Air or one of them does like a fear of flying

3405
02:50:49,160 --> 02:50:53,160
school or something where you can actually take these classes where they will help cure

3406
02:50:53,160 --> 02:50:54,160
you of your fear of flying.

3407
02:50:54,160 --> 02:50:55,160
Interesting.

3408
02:50:55,160 --> 02:50:57,160
And you live, you don't live that far from Denver, right?

3409
02:50:57,160 --> 02:50:58,160
Right.

3410
02:50:58,160 --> 02:50:59,160
That's where Frontiers Hub is.

3411
02:50:59,160 --> 02:51:02,160
And they're one of those companies that I would imagine would have something like that.

3412
02:51:02,160 --> 02:51:03,160
Check it out.

3413
02:51:03,160 --> 02:51:05,160
You know what the best flight I've ever had was?

3414
02:51:05,160 --> 02:51:09,160
Was a Southwest flight where it was me and Julie.

3415
02:51:09,160 --> 02:51:16,160
We were going to Las Vegas and we got on there and they like totally didn't give a fuck when

3416
02:51:16,160 --> 02:51:18,160
they were doing the flight safety.

3417
02:51:18,160 --> 02:51:19,160
Sounds like Southwest.

3418
02:51:19,160 --> 02:51:23,160
It's like, and if you have any questions, please hesitate to answer.

3419
02:51:23,160 --> 02:51:26,160
If you find the plane going down, you better hold on to your ass because we're going to

3420
02:51:26,160 --> 02:51:27,160
die.

3421
02:51:28,160 --> 02:51:35,160
You can see people like, Oh, and like, and then everyone else is like laughing so hard.

3422
02:51:35,160 --> 02:51:38,160
The people that got scared were embarrassed into laughing with them.

3423
02:51:38,160 --> 02:51:40,160
And then the guy says, just kidding.

3424
02:51:40,160 --> 02:51:43,160
That's like 98 percent.

3425
02:51:43,160 --> 02:51:45,160
What's our statistics?

3426
02:51:45,160 --> 02:51:46,160
It was great.

3427
02:51:46,160 --> 02:51:49,160
That's the best flight I've ever been on.

3428
02:51:49,160 --> 02:51:51,160
You just need liquor and pills, Jason.

3429
02:51:51,160 --> 02:51:52,160
It makes it easier.

3430
02:51:52,160 --> 02:51:53,160
All right.

3431
02:51:53,160 --> 02:51:54,160
Moving on.

3432
02:51:54,160 --> 02:51:56,160
You know what, though?

3433
02:51:56,160 --> 02:52:00,160
I, some people don't have the patience to do the drive or the train or anything like

3434
02:52:00,160 --> 02:52:01,160
that.

3435
02:52:01,160 --> 02:52:06,160
So, you know, at least you get to see such beautiful parts of the country as Elko, Nevada,

3436
02:52:06,160 --> 02:52:10,160
and all of Southern Wyoming across and the no tell motels.

3437
02:52:10,160 --> 02:52:16,160
Did we know the whole thing about flight is, you know, trying to say is going to the bathroom

3438
02:52:16,160 --> 02:52:18,160
on the plane worthwhile.

3439
02:52:18,160 --> 02:52:23,160
Do I need to get out of my window seat to go pee or can I hold it?

3440
02:52:23,160 --> 02:52:25,160
Always go to the bathroom on the plane.

3441
02:52:25,160 --> 02:52:27,160
You're never going to see those people again in your entire life.

3442
02:52:27,160 --> 02:52:30,160
And, Gamet, there's a way for a plane to have Fireball on it.

3443
02:52:30,160 --> 02:52:32,160
You get the little, um...

3444
02:52:32,160 --> 02:52:34,160
You mean the liquor, not the...

3445
02:52:34,160 --> 02:52:35,160
The liquor.

3446
02:52:35,160 --> 02:52:36,160
Yes.

3447
02:52:36,160 --> 02:52:37,160
Thank you.

3448
02:52:37,160 --> 02:52:43,160
They do have these little flasks that are disguised as tampons.

3449
02:52:43,160 --> 02:52:44,160
I kid you not.

3450
02:52:44,160 --> 02:52:46,160
They're actually for yachts, but...

3451
02:52:46,160 --> 02:52:49,160
Speaking of things you do because you'll never see the other people on the plane ever again.

3452
02:52:49,160 --> 02:52:52,160
This is a video game show, right?

3453
02:52:52,160 --> 02:52:54,160
We will talk about that at some point.

3454
02:52:54,160 --> 02:52:57,160
We just said this was a slow news week.

3455
02:52:57,160 --> 02:52:58,160
Fuck it.

3456
02:52:58,160 --> 02:52:59,160
We're filling space.

3457
02:52:59,160 --> 02:53:00,160
True.

3458
02:53:00,160 --> 02:53:01,160
True.

3459
02:53:01,160 --> 02:53:03,160
This is our new version of the fuck it show.

3460
02:53:03,160 --> 02:53:04,160
All right.

3461
02:53:04,160 --> 02:53:06,160
We got to get to phone calls too.

3462
02:53:06,160 --> 02:53:09,160
Loki's got one more story for us and then we're going to get to the phone calls.

3463
02:53:09,160 --> 02:53:13,160
1-877-GAMO-LR, username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

3464
02:53:13,160 --> 02:53:14,160
Loki, what do you have for us?

3465
02:53:14,160 --> 02:53:16,160
So I guess Second Life is happening soon.

3466
02:53:16,160 --> 02:53:17,160
November 2nd.

3467
02:53:17,160 --> 02:53:19,160
You mean Extra Life?

3468
02:53:19,160 --> 02:53:21,160
Extra Life, whatever.

3469
02:53:21,160 --> 02:53:23,160
Yeah, okay.

3470
02:53:23,160 --> 02:53:25,160
So yes, Extra Life.

3471
02:53:25,160 --> 02:53:28,160
And November 2nd.

3472
02:53:28,160 --> 02:53:33,160
So donate, sponsor people, do all that fun stuff.

3473
02:53:33,160 --> 02:53:38,160
Ah, it's this weekend for the Children's Miracle Network.

3474
02:53:38,160 --> 02:53:46,160
I think it's great that this charity kind of has really embraced this whole thing and kind of really made it one of their highlight fundraisers of the year.

3475
02:53:46,160 --> 02:53:51,160
I don't know if you've seen this, but on PlayStation 3 they actually have an ad for Extra Life right now.

3476
02:53:51,160 --> 02:53:54,160
And if you raise certain amounts of money you get PlayStation rewards with that.

3477
02:53:54,160 --> 02:53:57,160
So I thought that was really cool that it all kind of integrates together.

3478
02:53:57,160 --> 02:54:00,160
So, awesome.

3479
02:54:00,160 --> 02:54:01,160
All right.

3480
02:54:01,160 --> 02:54:03,160
Good luck to those of you doing Extra Life, by the way.

3481
02:54:03,160 --> 02:54:08,160
I'd love to do it, but my wife wouldn't let me have 25 hours of pure gaming.

3482
02:54:08,160 --> 02:54:13,160
We need to do something charity related, but I would really love to.

3483
02:54:13,160 --> 02:54:16,160
I have things to tell you offline regarding.

3484
02:54:16,160 --> 02:54:20,160
I would suggest, you know, we'll probably do the MS Walk again with Horde House next year.

3485
02:54:20,160 --> 02:54:22,160
And I'd really like OLR to get involved with that too.

3486
02:54:22,160 --> 02:54:24,160
Maybe we can raise a ton of money for a great cause.

3487
02:54:24,160 --> 02:54:25,160
So we'll look at that.

3488
02:54:25,160 --> 02:54:28,160
But for now, Extra Life, good luck to those of you doing it.

3489
02:54:28,160 --> 02:54:31,160
And yeah, I'll have to watch some of those streams myself.

3490
02:54:31,160 --> 02:54:35,160
All right, we're going to go right into phone calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

3491
02:54:35,160 --> 02:54:38,160
We're going to skip what I had on the show roll because I had this.

3492
02:54:38,160 --> 02:54:41,160
It was a Twitter news story and it ain't even worth it.

3493
02:54:41,160 --> 02:54:46,160
And the more I think about it, my eyes roll so far back in the back of my head, I can see my brain.

3494
02:54:46,160 --> 02:54:50,160
If you are dying to know what I was going to report on, that whole Sessler Gate thing.

3495
02:54:50,160 --> 02:54:51,160
That's all I'm going to say.

3496
02:54:51,160 --> 02:54:53,160
I don't even know what you're talking about.

3497
02:54:53,160 --> 02:54:55,160
I have no idea what that is.

3498
02:54:55,160 --> 02:54:56,160
Well, here I go.

3499
02:54:56,160 --> 02:54:58,160
No, it's perfect. Call it done.

3500
02:54:58,160 --> 02:55:00,160
Let's talk about it. Come on.

3501
02:55:00,160 --> 02:55:01,160
We do have a call.

3502
02:55:01,160 --> 02:55:02,160
And we'll talk about how ridiculous it is.

3503
02:55:02,160 --> 02:55:03,160
Okay, quickly.

3504
02:55:03,160 --> 02:55:10,160
He's whining on Twitter because supposedly there is something about the new console that's going to make it hard to do his job.

3505
02:55:10,160 --> 02:55:13,160
Like some big thing that isn't announced yet.

3506
02:55:13,160 --> 02:55:16,160
And it's not Xbox One, it's PlayStation 4.

3507
02:55:16,160 --> 02:55:17,160
That's all been deduced.

3508
02:55:17,160 --> 02:55:25,160
This is Reddit, Twitter, all these folks running NeoGaf and they've all got threads on it today.

3509
02:55:25,160 --> 02:55:27,160
And nobody really knows what it is.

3510
02:55:27,160 --> 02:55:34,160
And some of the popular thoughts are that perhaps Sony has invoked what Nintendo did earlier this year on YouTube.

3511
02:55:34,160 --> 02:55:38,160
Where there's going to be that restriction where they're not going to be able to monetize their YouTube videos.

3512
02:55:38,160 --> 02:55:41,160
Again, thoughts, rumors, speculation.

3513
02:55:41,160 --> 02:55:45,160
But I don't know if that would be it necessarily.

3514
02:55:45,160 --> 02:55:49,160
Because I think when Nintendo announced that, nobody got warning about that.

3515
02:55:49,160 --> 02:55:50,160
That just happened.

3516
02:55:50,160 --> 02:55:54,160
And that isn't supposed to impact review videos in fair use.

3517
02:55:54,160 --> 02:56:01,160
My thought is, genuinely, is that it's the PlayStation 4 preview review events.

3518
02:56:01,160 --> 02:56:04,160
Because it doesn't sound like they're sending out copies of PlayStation 4 games to people.

3519
02:56:04,160 --> 02:56:06,160
You have to come in and play them.

3520
02:56:06,160 --> 02:56:08,160
And that's what they do for audio CDs.

3521
02:56:08,160 --> 02:56:09,160
And a lot of those critics have to do.

3522
02:56:09,160 --> 02:56:11,160
Why? Piracy.

3523
02:56:11,160 --> 02:56:13,160
Because people ruined it.

3524
02:56:13,160 --> 02:56:18,160
And if you have to go somewhere else to play the game, you can't get video in advance.

3525
02:56:18,160 --> 02:56:22,160
That might ruin your day if you are somebody who does a lot of YouTube video reviews.

3526
02:56:22,160 --> 02:56:24,160
So, I don't know.

3527
02:56:24,160 --> 02:56:27,160
It's hard for me to feel sorry.

3528
02:56:27,160 --> 02:56:31,160
But it certainly is an interesting challenge about the new generation.

3529
02:56:32,160 --> 02:56:35,160
Whatever. So, there you go. In a nutshell, there's your story.

3530
02:56:35,160 --> 02:56:37,160
Now we can go to the calls.

3531
02:56:37,160 --> 02:56:38,160
Yes.

3532
02:56:38,160 --> 02:56:39,160
1877 Game O.L.R.

3533
02:56:39,160 --> 02:56:41,160
I saw a Doctor Who icon. You better answer it.

3534
02:56:41,160 --> 02:56:43,160
I will. Please call. 1877 Game O.L.R.

3535
02:56:43,160 --> 02:56:46,160
Our username on Skype. Orange Lounge Radio.

3536
02:56:46,160 --> 02:56:48,160
You can call in now and I will take the call.

3537
02:56:48,160 --> 02:56:52,160
In the meantime, do we have last minute stories? Probably not tonight.

3538
02:56:52,160 --> 02:56:54,160
No.

3539
02:56:54,160 --> 02:56:55,160
We had hardly any stories tonight.

3540
02:56:55,160 --> 02:56:57,160
I think you just took the last minute story.

3541
02:56:57,160 --> 02:56:58,160
Yeah. There you go.

3542
02:56:58,160 --> 02:57:01,160
I did see a couple tweets and they were things worth mentioning.

3543
02:57:01,160 --> 02:57:02,160
So, I want to get to that.

3544
02:57:02,160 --> 02:57:06,160
But again, if you want to call 1877 Game O.L.R.

3545
02:57:06,160 --> 02:57:08,160
Our username on Skype. Orange Lounge Radio.

3546
02:57:08,160 --> 02:57:09,160
I want Bobby to call.

3547
02:57:09,160 --> 02:57:11,160
But you excluded him in chat.

3548
02:57:11,160 --> 02:57:13,160
I didn't exclude him. I said other people.

3549
02:57:13,160 --> 02:57:15,160
I just said we also want some new people too.

3550
02:57:15,160 --> 02:57:16,160
Alright.

3551
02:57:16,160 --> 02:57:17,160
I encourage.

3552
02:57:17,160 --> 02:57:19,160
Let's get to the phones and see who's there.

3553
02:57:19,160 --> 02:57:21,160
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

3554
02:57:21,160 --> 02:57:23,160
Hey, what's up guys? This is Kaijuto.

3555
02:57:23,160 --> 02:57:25,160
Hey, Kaijuto. What's up? Long time no talk.

3556
02:57:25,160 --> 02:57:26,160
Hey, Doctor Who icon.

3557
02:57:27,160 --> 02:57:33,160
Yeah, nothing much. I just wanted to answer the question that one of your listeners proposed to you earlier today.

3558
02:57:33,160 --> 02:57:36,160
About the. Well, how was it worded?

3559
02:57:36,160 --> 02:57:39,160
Where you played a game and it was so disturbing that it made you stop.

3560
02:57:39,160 --> 02:57:40,160
Yes.

3561
02:57:40,160 --> 02:57:43,160
Yeah, I had a scene that made you just completely not want to play the rest of it.

3562
02:57:43,160 --> 02:57:44,160
Yes.

3563
02:57:44,160 --> 02:57:47,160
Yeah, my game is Grand Theft Auto Vice City.

3564
02:57:47,160 --> 02:57:52,160
There's a mission in that game where I think there's like a mob boss or something.

3565
02:57:52,160 --> 02:57:55,160
And they want you to kill his wife. They want you to run her off the road.

3566
02:57:56,160 --> 02:57:58,160
And I couldn't do that for the life of me.

3567
02:57:58,160 --> 02:58:02,160
Like you, you hear her like literally asking you like, why are you doing this to me?

3568
02:58:02,160 --> 02:58:03,160
Why are you trying to kill me?

3569
02:58:03,160 --> 02:58:08,160
It was so disturbing that I turned the game off, never finished it, never played it.

3570
02:58:08,160 --> 02:58:10,160
And that was back in 2002.

3571
02:58:12,160 --> 02:58:18,160
You know, it's hard for me to sit here and go, wow, you're so crazy for that answer or something like that.

3572
02:58:18,160 --> 02:58:19,160
Because I kind of sit here and go.

3573
02:58:19,160 --> 02:58:20,160
That's pretty admirable.

3574
02:58:20,160 --> 02:58:23,160
That's. Yeah, you just sound like a nice guy to me.

3575
02:58:23,160 --> 02:58:26,160
Yeah, I mean, if it was the mob guy would have shot him in the face, no problem.

3576
02:58:26,160 --> 02:58:29,160
You know, lock him in the, lock him in the trunk, do whatever.

3577
02:58:29,160 --> 02:58:33,160
But I don't know, it was just the fact that I felt she was an innocent.

3578
02:58:33,160 --> 02:58:38,160
You know, like when you play Grand Theft Auto, I mean, anyone that you kill in that game, you know, they're usually just criminals.

3579
02:58:38,160 --> 02:58:41,160
And, you know, they're they're either going to kill you before you kill them.

3580
02:58:41,160 --> 02:58:45,160
So you kind of you know, you kind of like work that out in your mind that, OK, you know, this is justifiable.

3581
02:58:45,160 --> 02:58:48,160
But I don't know, just killing that woman wasn't justifiable.

3582
02:58:48,160 --> 02:58:52,160
I could research and see if she had a meth lab or, you know, a child smuggling ring.

3583
02:58:52,160 --> 02:58:56,160
Well, well, this was in the 80s, so you were in any meth labs.

3584
02:58:56,160 --> 02:59:00,160
If anything, she was a cocaine queen or whatever the fuck.

3585
02:59:00,160 --> 02:59:13,160
You also kind of bring up an interesting point that it's like it's maybe kind of partially the realism of that that really kind of pushed it over the edge for you is that it was a little too realistic because I think like, OK, well, when I play Saints Row four or Saints Row three, excuse me.

3586
02:59:13,160 --> 02:59:15,160
And I try to run over as many people on the road as I can.

3587
02:59:15,160 --> 02:59:18,160
That's funny, but it's not realistic.

3588
02:59:18,160 --> 02:59:21,160
Like, it's totally not realistic or like Armageddon or any of those things.

3589
02:59:21,160 --> 02:59:24,160
Like it's just it's just cartoon characters. I'm running over my car and it's funny.

3590
02:59:24,160 --> 02:59:27,160
But like they are not screaming like, please. Oh, God.

3591
02:59:27,160 --> 02:59:30,160
You know, like they're not like it doesn't get that real.

3592
02:59:30,160 --> 02:59:34,160
Like it's just funny and like so my brain can easily differentiate.

3593
02:59:34,160 --> 02:59:39,160
But I can see where like, you know, if this poor innocent woman is screaming her head off, like, please don't kill her.

3594
02:59:39,160 --> 02:59:44,160
Like, yeah, it's kind of like maybe I maybe I don't want to do this.

3595
02:59:44,160 --> 02:59:47,160
Yeah, it was exactly that.

3596
02:59:47,160 --> 02:59:51,160
It was the fact that she was she was screaming and like literally talking to me and asking me why.

3597
02:59:51,160 --> 02:59:57,160
And, you know, in Grand Theft Auto, you don't you don't talk. So it's like I couldn't really explain to her why.

3598
02:59:57,160 --> 03:00:02,160
Are you trying to explain from the couch and it's not working.

3599
03:00:02,160 --> 03:00:09,160
So, well, that is I'm curious enough. Loki remembers that part because he's the big Grand Theft Auto guy.

3600
03:00:09,160 --> 03:00:12,160
No, I don't remember that.

3601
03:00:12,160 --> 03:00:17,160
I don't remember if I am that cold blooded man. I don't remember finishing Vice City.

3602
03:00:17,160 --> 03:00:23,160
I don't know if I ever did. Hmm. Because you didn't really, really get crazy about Grand Theft Auto until just the last one.

3603
03:00:23,160 --> 03:00:28,160
I think I ever finished three or Vice City. Maybe I did.

3604
03:00:28,160 --> 03:00:33,160
I don't remember. It was a long time ago. But look, he was looking was rocking out to the music so hard.

3605
03:00:33,160 --> 03:00:38,160
He didn't even hear the cheat codes. I'm going to blow stuff up. And that's pretty much it.

3606
03:00:38,160 --> 03:00:43,160
You know, I know I didn't finish Sandra's and I just want to finish it because I mean,

3607
03:00:43,160 --> 03:00:47,160
I love Vice City. I love the 80s. I mean, I have like a nice vibe to it, but just that part.

3608
03:00:47,160 --> 03:00:52,160
But I'm going to hang up now. Let some more calls get in.

3609
03:00:52,160 --> 03:00:57,160
All right. I was talking to you guys again. I'll be calling in more. Sounds good. Good to hear from you.

3610
03:00:57,160 --> 03:01:02,160
All right. Take care, buddy. Bye. One eight seven seven game oil are his name on Skype, Orange Laundry.

3611
03:01:02,160 --> 03:01:06,160
Did you get to compliment the doctor who icon? I think you did at the beginning. I did. He did have a doctor who icon.

3612
03:01:06,160 --> 03:01:11,160
And then the whole time during his phone call, I was playing the old theme since he had the 80s icon.

3613
03:01:11,160 --> 03:01:16,160
It was classic who not not a new who. Are you going to go to that whole 3D screening of

3614
03:01:16,160 --> 03:01:21,160
Doctor Who or whatever? I heard about this because I hate people. Oh, that's a fair answer.

3615
03:01:21,160 --> 03:01:26,160
I hate going to the movies like I don't like going to opening night anything. I don't either.

3616
03:01:26,160 --> 03:01:31,160
Unless it's like something I'm super excited about. But it's like I have to see the Hunger Games catching fire.

3617
03:01:31,160 --> 03:01:36,160
I just don't like people that much. I don't blame you. Well, we like this person that's calling in right now.

3618
03:01:36,160 --> 03:01:41,160
Hi. Are you there? I'm right here and I'm glad you like this person. I do like this person.

3619
03:01:41,160 --> 03:01:46,160
Hey, Rama. How you doing? I'm doing pretty good. A little tired, but I'm good. Yeah.

3620
03:01:46,160 --> 03:01:51,160
Was there a con this weekend? No, but I work and now my commute, instead of being

3621
03:01:51,160 --> 03:01:56,160
from Brooklyn to Midtown Manhattan, is from Brooklyn to Jersey. So three hour commute every single day.

3622
03:01:57,160 --> 03:02:02,160
Oh my gosh. But I was going to say, as far as the anime cons go too, Halloween is the one time

3623
03:02:02,160 --> 03:02:07,160
of the year where you're supposed to dress up. So it's like, it's cosplayers vacation.

3624
03:02:07,160 --> 03:02:13,160
Or as I like to call it, National Cosplayers Day. Fair enough. And you know I'm just teasing you.

3625
03:02:13,160 --> 03:02:18,160
I'm all for it. What else is on your mind, buddy? Three things and I'll make it quick.

3626
03:02:18,160 --> 03:02:24,160
Number one, and whereas this is a frugal question of the week, I'll make this part brief.

3627
03:02:24,160 --> 03:02:30,160
I was playing Bioshock. Going through the level. My old roommate was standing there with his D&D crew.

3628
03:02:30,160 --> 03:02:36,160
And they watched me play the game. I come to this one section where there is a casket sitting on a shelf.

3629
03:02:36,160 --> 03:02:43,160
I'm like, okay. I walk over to it. The casket explodes. There are demon, creatures coming at me.

3630
03:02:43,160 --> 03:02:48,160
I'm killing them and I'm like, what the fuck is this? Holy shit, what the fuck?

3631
03:02:48,160 --> 03:02:53,160
I kill them all and I'm just staring at the screen. I pause it and I drop the controller and it's like, fuck this.

3632
03:02:53,160 --> 03:02:57,160
I'm done. Well played, Bioshock. Well played.

3633
03:02:57,160 --> 03:03:02,160
Well, there you go. That is a scary game that nobody brought up earlier. So, good answer.

3634
03:03:02,160 --> 03:03:05,160
Yeah, but mind you, I was playing with the lights on.

3635
03:03:08,160 --> 03:03:10,160
What else is on your mind, buddy?

3636
03:03:10,160 --> 03:03:12,160
Anyone? Anyone?

3637
03:03:12,160 --> 03:03:14,160
No, I was just saying, what else is on your mind, buddy?

3638
03:03:14,160 --> 03:03:20,160
My bad. My bad. Second thing, this was passed to me, someone on my fan page.

3639
03:03:20,160 --> 03:03:25,160
And they are spreading the words of their Extra Life campaign out of Ohio.

3640
03:03:27,160 --> 03:03:37,160
The group is called Happy Family and Friends. They're trying to raise $1200 for a local hospital out of Children's Miracle Network Hospital in Ohio.

3641
03:03:37,160 --> 03:03:39,160
So, I'm just trying to spread the word of that.

3642
03:03:39,160 --> 03:03:42,160
So, this is a part of the Extra Life, like one of the groups doing it.

3643
03:03:42,160 --> 03:03:45,160
Okay, awesome. Well, we're all for that, all for charity events.

3644
03:03:45,160 --> 03:03:48,160
How can we find more information on this? What games are they playing? Do we know?

3645
03:03:48,160 --> 03:03:57,160
They have not mentioned, but they did say there's going to be a lot of video games, anime, Kevin Smith, crude humor. Did I mention Kevin Smith?

3646
03:03:57,160 --> 03:04:01,160
Is Kevin Smith going to be there or are they just watching Chasing Amy?

3647
03:04:01,160 --> 03:04:04,160
Nobody watches Chasing Amy. I thought you knew this.

3648
03:04:04,160 --> 03:04:06,160
Fuck you, I love that movie.

3649
03:04:06,160 --> 03:04:08,160
Hey!

3650
03:04:08,160 --> 03:04:10,160
So, you're a Tracer.

3651
03:04:10,160 --> 03:04:14,160
I will let you slide on it because you didn't say Jersey Girl.

3652
03:04:14,160 --> 03:04:16,160
No, God no. Who would say Jersey Girl?

3653
03:04:16,160 --> 03:04:18,160
At least he didn't raise his hand and ask, what's a Nubian?

3654
03:04:18,160 --> 03:04:20,160
Oh, what's a Nubian?

3655
03:04:20,160 --> 03:04:22,160
Shut the fuck up!

3656
03:04:22,160 --> 03:04:25,160
That's how I incur the wrath of a black man, Rama.

3657
03:04:25,160 --> 03:04:27,160
Alright.

3658
03:04:27,160 --> 03:04:30,160
I just like that that whole exchange was staged in the movie. That was great.

3659
03:04:30,160 --> 03:04:34,160
In all seriousness, what else is on your mind, buddy? You said three things.

3660
03:04:34,160 --> 03:04:38,160
Yeah, I already told him this. Now, I'm going to let you guys know.

3661
03:04:38,160 --> 03:04:48,160
As you know, I have this issue with Chain Stop and I refuse to give them my money for the way they treat some of their customers and their products and this and that.

3662
03:04:48,160 --> 03:04:50,160
Or their employees.

3663
03:04:50,160 --> 03:04:52,160
Yep, them too.

3664
03:04:52,160 --> 03:04:59,160
Long story short, old roommate reimbursed me money for a game that he can't find, so I go buy a used copy.

3665
03:04:59,160 --> 03:05:09,160
I go in, they have their special, two games for $10. I happen to notice at least a good quarter of the games on it are games I need for my PS3.

3666
03:05:09,160 --> 03:05:18,160
So, I've come to the conclusion that as long as it's not a new game, games I will see a little portion of my money.

3667
03:05:18,160 --> 03:05:26,160
So, what made you decide that ethically you're going to decide, okay, I'll boycott GameStop most of the time?

3668
03:05:26,160 --> 03:05:36,160
I figure, you know, I might as well get a good deal on a used game as long as I have the game, the manual, and the original box art.

3669
03:05:36,160 --> 03:05:39,160
If not, I'll go to Amazon and spend an extra $10.

3670
03:05:39,160 --> 03:05:48,160
I mean, eventually you just can't boycott fully forever. Eventually you get to that point where you know what?

3671
03:05:48,160 --> 03:05:54,160
Eff it. Might as well. I'm just going to go in, get what I want, and leave.

3672
03:05:54,160 --> 03:06:01,160
As long as they don't ask me for power up rewards, as long as they don't ask me to reserve this or that, I just want the game and I want to go.

3673
03:06:01,160 --> 03:06:06,160
That's part of the reason I like Amazon, because like Jamie, I don't like people sometimes.

3674
03:06:06,160 --> 03:06:15,160
And Amazon, you just click your thing, or any online site really, I know I keep hitting that one, but you just go on, you order what you want, and then it magically shows up at your door. It's great.

3675
03:06:15,160 --> 03:06:24,160
Yeah, at least you don't have to deal with this. You go into the store to buy something, headphones are on, and they're talking to you like you can hear them.

3676
03:06:24,160 --> 03:06:25,160
Right.

3677
03:06:25,160 --> 03:06:35,160
You can kind of hear them, but you know the transaction, what you're doing, so you just want them to just pull up the screen, you can punch in your rewards card, pay for your item, and leave.

3678
03:06:35,160 --> 03:06:40,160
Alright, well Ram, I'm going to let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thank you as always for the call.

3679
03:06:40,160 --> 03:06:41,160
Ain't no problem broski.

3680
03:06:41,160 --> 03:06:43,160
And everybody listen to Anime Jam Session.

3681
03:06:43,160 --> 03:06:51,160
Yes, because we will be covering what may be our very last con that we're going to, but we have another con review coming up in a couple weeks after that.

3682
03:06:51,160 --> 03:06:53,160
Well then it's not really your last con, is it?

3683
03:06:53,160 --> 03:06:55,160
For the staff, yes.

3684
03:06:55,160 --> 03:06:57,160
Wait, so you guys are quitting cons?

3685
03:06:57,160 --> 03:06:59,160
No, we're done for the year.

3686
03:06:59,160 --> 03:07:01,160
Oh, for the year. Oh god, I was like, oh my god, wait a minute.

3687
03:07:01,160 --> 03:07:04,160
Oh, no, no, no, never. Never.

3688
03:07:04,160 --> 03:07:09,160
I was like, Ram, what the fuck is going on? Okay, for the year, that makes sense.

3689
03:07:09,160 --> 03:07:14,160
No, I think my funeral services might be at a con. That's how much of a con for I am.

3690
03:07:14,160 --> 03:07:26,160
Rama, not that I want to talk about that day anytime soon, but if I happen to still be here when that happens, I will see to it that the fucking kids pay their respects to the great black Luigi.

3691
03:07:26,160 --> 03:07:30,160
Will we be putting up the death note with your name in it?

3692
03:07:30,160 --> 03:07:33,160
This time I will allow it.

3693
03:07:33,160 --> 03:07:35,160
Alright, take care buddy.

3694
03:07:35,160 --> 03:07:46,160
For the record, one last thing. Every time I see someone refer to SNK, I don't think of the anime, I think of my... and all the King of Fighters games.

3695
03:07:46,160 --> 03:07:48,160
I always think of Capcom vs SNK 2, which is me.

3696
03:07:48,160 --> 03:07:53,160
I keep thinking of Shingeki no Kyojin. You start reading the manga, it's phenomenal.

3697
03:07:53,160 --> 03:07:55,160
Yeah, I don't think I'm gonna.

3698
03:07:55,160 --> 03:07:57,160
You have to, it's so good.

3699
03:07:57,160 --> 03:07:58,160
I gotta wrap up, take care buddy.

3700
03:07:58,160 --> 03:07:59,160
Later.

3701
03:08:00,160 --> 03:08:06,160
That's gonna do it for the Skypline tonight. I'm really sorry to those that didn't get through, but if you want to call in in a future week, you can do that.

3702
03:08:06,160 --> 03:08:16,160
Call in, or you can always leave an email at mailbagatorangelaungeradio.com, a Facebook comment at facebook.com slash orangelaungeradio, or a tweet at twitter.com slash o-l-r.

3703
03:08:16,160 --> 03:08:19,160
Speaking of tweets, I have a few of these to do tonight.

3704
03:08:19,160 --> 03:08:22,160
sj100matt sent us a few tweets.

3705
03:08:22,160 --> 03:08:26,160
This one you sent us about Neon FM was in last week's show, just a heads up.

3706
03:08:26,160 --> 03:08:31,160
But the other one is about the Conan O'Brien thing where he played the scary games.

3707
03:08:31,160 --> 03:08:34,160
I've seen the tweets about this, I haven't watched this yet.

3708
03:08:34,160 --> 03:08:38,160
But I'll have to check this out, I don't want to play it over the air because it's Conan's thing.

3709
03:08:38,160 --> 03:08:43,160
But check that out, I'm sure it's hilarious because Conan is hilarious.

3710
03:08:43,160 --> 03:08:48,160
I paid a lot of money to see him live after he got kicked off of NBC and it was worth every penny.

3711
03:08:48,160 --> 03:08:49,160
So good times.

3712
03:08:49,160 --> 03:08:53,160
So check that out, he plays Slender the Eight pages and Amnesia and I'm sure it's great.

3713
03:08:54,160 --> 03:08:56,160
Tigerclaw sent us a few tweets.

3714
03:08:56,160 --> 03:09:01,160
Classic games are now preserved and accessible on archive.org.

3715
03:09:01,160 --> 03:09:06,160
How does this work? Because isn't emulation kind of a gray area? I'm trying to read about this.

3716
03:09:06,160 --> 03:09:10,160
The Internet Archive has created the Historical Software Archive,

3717
03:09:10,160 --> 03:09:15,160
which is significantly older software runnable in a browser, which includes many games.

3718
03:09:15,160 --> 03:09:20,160
Thanks to JSMess, the multi-emulator supersystem available in Java.

3719
03:09:21,160 --> 03:09:25,160
Jason Scott from the Internet Archive's site says,

3720
03:09:25,160 --> 03:09:29,160
We have the ability to watch video, listen to music, and read documents right in our browsers.

3721
03:09:29,160 --> 03:09:32,160
Not so with classic software until now.

3722
03:09:32,160 --> 03:09:37,160
Included in the collection are games such as Mystery House by Roberta Williams,

3723
03:09:37,160 --> 03:09:40,160
Karateka by Jordan Mechner, I remember that game,

3724
03:09:40,160 --> 03:09:44,160
and Atari's infamous E.T., the extraterrestrial.

3725
03:09:44,160 --> 03:09:49,160
I had no idea, like does the copyright lift on this after so many years?

3726
03:09:49,160 --> 03:09:51,160
I thought it was like 75 years and then some.

3727
03:09:51,160 --> 03:09:54,160
Because the Disney laws keep getting passed to keep Mickey Mouse out of public domain.

3728
03:09:54,160 --> 03:09:57,160
He might not have renewed that one.

3729
03:09:57,160 --> 03:09:59,160
I guess that's true.

3730
03:09:59,160 --> 03:10:04,160
Or maybe because emulation is such a gray area because these games are so old,

3731
03:10:04,160 --> 03:10:07,160
like maybe it's just not a big deal. I don't know.

3732
03:10:07,160 --> 03:10:10,160
But that's still pretty cool. I'll check that out after the show.

3733
03:10:10,160 --> 03:10:15,160
One other quick tweet here from Tigerclaw. It's about the Mortal Kombat film director,

3734
03:10:16,160 --> 03:10:20,160
Kevin Tancho Rowan. I'm totally mispronouncing that name, sorry.

3735
03:10:20,160 --> 03:10:24,160
He's the director of Mortal Kombat Legacy and he has walked away from it.

3736
03:10:24,160 --> 03:10:26,160
He talked about it on Twitter.

3737
03:10:26,160 --> 03:10:31,160
He did the Mortal Kombat Legacy web series and that was after Mortal Kombat Rebirth.

3738
03:10:31,160 --> 03:10:36,160
New Line Cinema actually asked him to direct a future film in the Mortal Kombat universe,

3739
03:10:36,160 --> 03:10:38,160
but he said,

3740
03:10:38,160 --> 03:10:42,160
After three years of combat, I've decided to move on to other creative opportunities.

3741
03:10:42,160 --> 03:10:46,160
I wish everyone involved in the movie a big success. Thanks.

3742
03:10:46,160 --> 03:10:49,160
I can see that. Three years is a long time to spend on one project.

3743
03:10:49,160 --> 03:10:52,160
You might not want your life and your career defined by the one thing.

3744
03:10:52,160 --> 03:10:54,160
So, I can see that.

3745
03:10:54,160 --> 03:10:58,160
Speaking of video games becoming movies, you know, BlizzCon is in two weeks

3746
03:10:58,160 --> 03:11:01,160
and there's going to be lots of Warcraft movie news that comes out of that, I'm sure.

3747
03:11:01,160 --> 03:11:04,160
I think they cast their first person too. I think I remember seeing a story on that too,

3748
03:11:04,160 --> 03:11:07,160
that their first official person is cast in that.

3749
03:11:07,160 --> 03:11:11,160
Oh, I know Tigerclaw tweeted that at some point,

3750
03:11:11,160 --> 03:11:15,160
but I don't have it up on the screen right now and it is live radio.

3751
03:11:17,160 --> 03:11:20,160
I think it's probably on the Horde House page.

3752
03:11:20,160 --> 03:11:24,160
I'm sure it got posted there. I'm trying to find it right now.

3753
03:11:24,160 --> 03:11:26,160
Nah, I can't bring it up. I don't remember the guy's name.

3754
03:11:26,160 --> 03:11:32,160
Maybe somebody will yell it out in chat, but it was from some Viking thing on TV.

3755
03:11:32,160 --> 03:11:35,160
I didn't recognize the name of the guy.

3756
03:11:35,160 --> 03:11:37,160
There was stuff about Colin Farrell in the past.

3757
03:11:37,160 --> 03:11:39,160
Yeah, those are rumors.

3758
03:11:39,160 --> 03:11:46,160
Him and Paula Patton, who is Robin Thicke's wife, is rumored for that movie too.

3759
03:11:46,160 --> 03:11:49,160
We don't know who they're playing though. They haven't said anything about that.

3760
03:11:49,160 --> 03:11:53,160
Alright, we'll get into more of that on Horde House.

3761
03:11:53,160 --> 03:11:56,160
But for now, this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio...

3762
03:11:56,160 --> 03:11:57,160
Travis Fimmel.

3763
03:11:57,160 --> 03:11:58,160
Thank you, thank you.

3764
03:11:58,160 --> 03:12:01,160
This week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio is about to an end.

3765
03:12:01,160 --> 03:12:04,160
Hey, I want to thank you guys for tuning in and listening to the show.

3766
03:12:04,160 --> 03:12:08,160
Thank you for supporting our little podcast that we do here every week.

3767
03:12:08,160 --> 03:12:10,160
We do this for you guys. You're great.

3768
03:12:10,160 --> 03:12:14,160
And if you like what you hear here at Orange Lounge Radio, please just help us spread the word.

3769
03:12:14,160 --> 03:12:17,160
Leave us a nice review on iTunes or a thumbs up on Stitcher.

3770
03:12:17,160 --> 03:12:19,160
Actually, Stitcher does reviews now. I don't know if you guys know that.

3771
03:12:19,160 --> 03:12:23,160
Stitcher has reviews, so you can review us there. That would be fantastic.

3772
03:12:23,160 --> 03:12:28,160
Or wherever you found out about this podcast, somebody else will probably find out about this podcast too.

3773
03:12:28,160 --> 03:12:30,160
So please help us spread the word.

3774
03:12:30,160 --> 03:12:33,160
In the meantime, we're going to go around and get everybody's final thought.

3775
03:12:33,160 --> 03:12:36,160
Jason, thank you very much for taking the drive up here to be with us tonight.

3776
03:12:36,160 --> 03:12:37,160
Always.

3777
03:12:37,160 --> 03:12:38,160
A little voiceover work you do on the show.

3778
03:12:38,160 --> 03:12:39,160
Always.

3779
03:12:39,160 --> 03:12:41,160
And thank you for being you.

3780
03:12:41,160 --> 03:12:43,160
Thank you for the washer and dryer.

3781
03:12:43,160 --> 03:12:49,160
It's the least I can do for the guy that helped keep our website up and running for the past so many years.

3782
03:12:49,160 --> 03:12:50,160
Decade?

3783
03:12:50,160 --> 03:12:51,160
Yeah, for the past decade.

3784
03:12:51,160 --> 03:12:53,160
It feels like a little bit under that. I think, what, 2004?

3785
03:12:53,160 --> 03:12:56,160
I think I was graduated by the time everything really happened. Maybe not.

3786
03:12:56,160 --> 03:13:01,160
Between you and Dekeman. Although it probably is about time we look at doing a new OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

3787
03:13:01,160 --> 03:13:05,160
Because there's so much. Now that we have VOG Network, there's so much on the old site we don't really use.

3788
03:13:05,160 --> 03:13:10,160
So we need to trim it back a little bit and get those Chinese spammers out of there. Bastards.

3789
03:13:10,160 --> 03:13:12,160
Anyway, your final thought, sir.

3790
03:13:12,160 --> 03:13:15,160
Wow, what is my final thought?

3791
03:13:15,160 --> 03:13:24,160
Hurry to driving. Another 14 hours next Saturday, plus the two hours tonight to get back to San Francisco.

3792
03:13:24,160 --> 03:13:26,160
It's nice. It's a wonderful drive.

3793
03:13:26,160 --> 03:13:28,160
Are you driving to Phoenix next Saturday?

3794
03:13:28,160 --> 03:13:30,160
Yeah, I'm out of here. I'm driving to Phoenix.

3795
03:13:30,160 --> 03:13:33,160
I almost was going to be doing that same drive.

3796
03:13:33,160 --> 03:13:35,160
Yeah, you mentioned it earlier. I was like, ooh, hello.

3797
03:13:35,160 --> 03:13:39,160
Yeah, I'm going to Arizona for at least a week next Saturday.

3798
03:13:39,160 --> 03:13:43,160
And the funny thing is I might even be back in San Francisco the following week.

3799
03:13:43,160 --> 03:13:46,160
And then I have to figure out what my Thanksgiving plans are going to be.

3800
03:13:46,160 --> 03:13:52,160
But if I do come back to San Francisco, that means I'm going to do the 22 hour drive I-80 back home.

3801
03:13:52,160 --> 03:13:54,160
Because that's the only one that makes sense.

3802
03:13:54,160 --> 03:13:56,160
Well, maybe we'll see you right back here on OLR next month.

3803
03:13:56,160 --> 03:13:57,160
Quite possibly.

3804
03:13:57,160 --> 03:14:00,160
You're always welcome at the house anytime, Jason.

3805
03:14:00,160 --> 03:14:04,160
All right. Let's see. How about Dark Sakura? Your final thought.

3806
03:14:04,160 --> 03:14:05,160
Animal Crossing.

3807
03:14:05,160 --> 03:14:06,160
Man, there's... no.

3808
03:14:06,160 --> 03:14:07,160
Ed, move out.

3809
03:14:07,160 --> 03:14:08,160
Fuck Ed.

3810
03:14:08,160 --> 03:14:09,160
That's the final thought.

3811
03:14:09,160 --> 03:14:16,160
I'm absolutely irritated and I'm just having now all three characters in my village ignore Ed.

3812
03:14:16,160 --> 03:14:18,160
Because fuck him.

3813
03:14:18,160 --> 03:14:21,160
Not really, because he's disgusting.

3814
03:14:21,160 --> 03:14:24,160
I'm sorry, you don't wear purple eyeshadow when you're blue.

3815
03:14:24,160 --> 03:14:26,160
It just doesn't work.

3816
03:14:26,160 --> 03:14:27,160
And you don't give people jackhammers.

3817
03:14:27,160 --> 03:14:29,160
I'll tell all the Smurfs I know your fashion tips.

3818
03:14:29,160 --> 03:14:31,160
You know what? Okay.

3819
03:14:31,160 --> 03:14:36,160
No, mine is... this has been the night for nostalgia.

3820
03:14:36,160 --> 03:14:39,160
Because, you know, Pokemon and rival schools.

3821
03:14:39,160 --> 03:14:41,160
But then, Ikuma.

3822
03:14:41,160 --> 03:14:45,160
You are wonderful, Ikuma-san, but you had to mention Last Blade.

3823
03:14:45,160 --> 03:14:48,160
And I love that series.

3824
03:14:48,160 --> 03:14:51,160
So, I want a new Last Blade game, too.

3825
03:14:51,160 --> 03:14:54,160
My final thought tonight is fuck this headache.

3826
03:14:54,160 --> 03:14:59,160
And bless that bottle of wine that I'm going to get to open because Alan was able to get home.

3827
03:14:59,160 --> 03:15:01,160
Because you want a bigger headache.

3828
03:15:01,160 --> 03:15:02,160
That's right.

3829
03:15:02,160 --> 03:15:05,160
Thank you, Alan, for running and making light rail.

3830
03:15:05,160 --> 03:15:07,160
He can't hear me. He has headphones on.

3831
03:15:07,160 --> 03:15:08,160
Alright.

3832
03:15:08,160 --> 03:15:10,160
Oh no, here he is.

3833
03:15:10,160 --> 03:15:12,160
He came out and said you're welcome. Thank you, Alan.

3834
03:15:12,160 --> 03:15:14,160
Rob, we bread.

3835
03:15:14,160 --> 03:15:16,160
Finally. Yay, Jamie, we mated.

3836
03:15:16,160 --> 03:15:18,160
Wait. Scratch that.

3837
03:15:18,160 --> 03:15:19,160
Loki, last but not least.

3838
03:15:19,160 --> 03:15:21,160
No, we breed puzzle pieces, remember?

3839
03:15:21,160 --> 03:15:23,160
Loki, last but not least. Your final thought.

3840
03:15:23,160 --> 03:15:29,160
My final thought is I'm still acquiring pieces for my portable screen thing.

3841
03:15:29,160 --> 03:15:33,160
I've actually been using that screen quite a bit at work because that's what we play.

3842
03:15:33,160 --> 03:15:38,160
It's what I play on my PlayStation 3, so it's working out really good.

3843
03:15:38,160 --> 03:15:45,160
And I'm now trying to find an audio amp, which I'm going to go with an old USB speaker.

3844
03:15:45,160 --> 03:15:48,160
And the battery, which I have one picked out already.

3845
03:15:48,160 --> 03:15:52,160
And now a DC-DC converter.

3846
03:15:53,160 --> 03:15:58,160
And then I just need to design a case and vacuum form that bitch.

3847
03:15:58,160 --> 03:15:59,160
Which will be hard.

3848
03:15:59,160 --> 03:16:00,160
Good luck.

3849
03:16:00,160 --> 03:16:02,160
The Virtual Boy looks so weird.

3850
03:16:02,160 --> 03:16:04,160
I love my Virtual Boy hat. I love it.

3851
03:16:04,160 --> 03:16:06,160
Alright, that's really it. We're done. We're out of here.

3852
03:16:06,160 --> 03:16:08,160
Thank you guys very much for listening to our show.

3853
03:16:08,160 --> 03:16:10,160
We'll be back next week to do it all again.

3854
03:16:10,160 --> 03:16:12,160
Episode 526.

3855
03:16:12,160 --> 03:16:14,160
Until then, Jason, take us out.

3856
03:16:14,160 --> 03:16:18,160
You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
