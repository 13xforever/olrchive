7000	12000	Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	17000	This week, Square Enix announced one old and one new Kingdom Hearts game
17000	20000	A former would-be dancing game slips down and seeks a modern revival
20000	23000	And the creators of Missing Riven announce their latest adventure game
23000	27000	Everything old is new again on tonight's episode which begins right now
27000	30000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	35000	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show
35000	39000	Where every gamer has a voice, it is Orange Lounge Radio
39000	45000	For this, episode number 524, October the 20th of 2013
45000	50000	My name is Rob Roberts, here to talk with you about the latest and greatest in the video gaming world
50000	54000	With my co-hosts, first off, say hello to DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers
54000	56000	I have the coffee jitters
56000	59000	A coffee jitter? What is the coffee jitters?
59000	64000	I had, granted it was decaf, but I still had a venti americano before I came over
64000	67000	And then I had coffee just now, and I've had lamb
67000	68000	Now you want another?
68000	70000	No, I'm good
70000	71000	You don't want any more coffee?
71000	74000	I thought that's how you fix the coffee jitters, more coffee?
74000	76000	No, I'm actually quite good
76000	78000	Alright, are you sure you're not going to be driving home?
78000	80000	And then, Dan, coffee!
80000	82000	I've got coffee at home if it comes to that
82000	85000	An old OLR in-joke for those that don't know
85000	87000	Rob!
87000	91000	We have a few of those here, we have been doing this show for quite a long time
91000	95000	Our longest running inside joke, say hello everybody to tech master Loki
95000	96000	Hi
96000	97000	How you doing, Loki?
97000	98000	I'm doing fine
98000	100000	I'm just kidding, I just didn't have any other good transition
100000	101000	How have you been?
101000	103000	Um, okay
103000	106000	Yeah? Anything new and exciting going on?
106000	108000	What's your latest project you've been working on?
108000	111000	You are, after all, the man of many projects
111000	113000	Um, well, let's see
113000	115000	I'm still trying to work on finishing up
115000	117000	Actually, that's what I'm doing right now
117000	119000	I'm looking for a 12 volt battery
119000	122000	Um, just that separate screen thing
122000	126000	The, uh, wireless second screen for, like, the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360
126000	128000	Oh, right, you talked about that a couple weeks back
128000	129000	How's that going?
129000	130000	Oh, it's going alright
130000	132000	I've just been running a little low on money
132000	134000	So I've been kind of holding off
134000	138000	Just because, um, also I'm trying to find the right battery for it
138000	140000	Because I want to find something that's not too expensive
140000	142000	And I don't really want to ship anything from China
142000	145000	Because it's going to take a long time to get here
145000	149000	So I'm just trying to find something that's got somewhat decent battery life
149000	151000	And, I don't know
151000	156000	I took apart my wireless HDMI receiver the other day
156000	161000	And thankfully, it's actually, the board inside it's a lot smaller than I thought it would be
161000	164000	And they have, like, a daughter board on there as well
164000	166000	So it's going to be easy to take apart
166000	168000	And then, uh, I don't know
168000	171000	Once you get this second screen project of yours finished
171000	173000	What's the first thing you're going to do with it?
173000	175000	Like, what's the first game you're going to play with it?
175000	177000	Grand Theft Auto 5, of course
177000	180000	Because, you know, that tells me what's the whole point of this project
180000	182000	Grand Theft Auto 5
182000	184000	But here's the thing, though, is I don't really need it anymore
184000	188000	Because I have a setup in my living room where I have my office chair there
188000	191000	And my computer monitor, since I don't really have a computer on
191000	193000	So I actually play Grand Theft Auto on that
193000	196000	Um, so, technically I don't really need it anymore
196000	198000	Because I still have a screen to play it on
198000	200000	While my wife watches TV
200000	202000	But I'm still going to build it
202000	204000	That's fair, because it's a thing
204000	206000	It's become a thing
206000	208000	And now you have to see it through to completion
208000	210000	I had to prototype something this week
210000	215000	Uh, that it's some thing that they're planning on trying to sell or something
215000	223000	It's like, uh, some little figure with, like, a USB, like, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth adapters built into it
223000	227000	And a thumb drive or something
227000	229000	So I got to play with that this week
229000	231000	But, yeah, I do want to make this the thing
231000	233000	Um, I got to do
233000	235000	After I figure, well, after I get all the parts
235000	238000	So really only parts I have left are the battery
238000	243000	And probably a 12 volt step down to 5 volt
243000	248000	Um, and then some miscellaneous ports and wires
248000	250000	And then once that's all done
250000	252000	And I figure out how I want to, uh, be laid out
252000	254000	I have to get the wood to build a mold
254000	259000	Or, yeah, sort of, I guess, a mold for, um, vacuum for me
259000	261000	And then I have to build the vacuum for me rig
261000	263000	Which, that's easy, because that's just a box, so
263000	266000	Oh my gosh, alright
266000	268000	Uh, let's go to our chat room
268000	270000	We do tape live every Sunday night
270000	272000	At 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern
272000	274000	Right after the Bobby Black Wolf show
274000	276000	At the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com
276000	278000	And if you are listening live on this Sunday
278000	280000	You can join us in our live chat room
280000	282000	Live.vognetwork.com
282000	284000	And, uh, Ragenator
284000	286000	Wanting to know in chat
286000	288000	What baconified food product
288000	290000	Did Loki bring to the OLR studio tonight
290000	292000	If it's your first time ever listening to OLR
292000	294000	Uh, hi and welcome
294000	296000	And thanks for checking us out, first off
296000	298000	Second off, Loki's pretty notorious
298000	300000	For bringing a variety of different
300000	302000	Fast food, slow food, whatever food
302000	304000	I mean, Dark Soccer
304000	306000	Pretty reliably brings a salad
306000	308000	But Loki can bring a lot of different things
308000	310000	I don't bring a salad reliably
310000	312000	I used to when
312000	314000	I bring a lot more meat these days
314000	316000	Alright, meat salad
316000	318000	I didn't bring anything with bacon on it
318000	320000	Just because I wasn't that hungry
320000	322000	And so I just kinda got
322000	324000	It's a two cheeseburger meal from McDonald's
324000	326000	Cause it's cheap, I didn't really need to eat anything
326000	328000	But I know, cause last time
328000	330000	I skipped dinner, I was just like
330000	332000	Oh, I'm not hungry, I'm gonna skip dinner
332000	334000	And then like when I got home at like 10 o'clock I was hungry
334000	336000	So I just, I got something
336000	338000	Something kinda small
338000	340000	Cause I don't really like going to McDonald's
340000	342000	In the evening cause their fries are stale
342000	344000	And yeah, their fries were stale again
344000	346000	I ate them anyways, but they were stale
346000	348000	And I'm not, not enjoying that
348000	350000	And their burgers weren't even that good either
350000	352000	So it was just kinda eating just to be full
352000	354000	That's pretty much it
354000	356000	I'd love to see you bring some In-N-Out
356000	358000	But, I, okay, I would
358000	360000	But to reliably get here on time with
360000	362000	In-N-Out, it's just a crap shoot cause I can't tell
362000	364000	How busy they're gonna be and
364000	366000	Sometimes it's like 30 minutes to get out of there
366000	368000	So, um
368000	370000	Yeah, I just didn't do that
370000	372000	Although I did eat just bacon the other day
372000	374000	For lunch, that's all I had was bacon
374000	376000	So, I guess that counts
376000	378000	And so I ran out of bacon
378000	380000	Cause we had to eat the whole package before it was gone
380000	382000	My wife says, well you ate all the bacon
382000	384000	I'm like, dude, I only had like three pieces
384000	386000	So, you ate all the bacon
386000	388000	That's right
388000	390000	Um, you know, your weakness
390000	392000	For bacon is like my weakness for pumpkin
392000	394000	And this is the time of year, let me tell you
394000	396000	Uh, oh, you're shaking your head
396000	398000	That's right, you don't like the pumpkin stuff, huh?
398000	400000	Went to Trader Joe's the other day, Alan and I loaded up
400000	402000	On all this pumpkin stuff, like pumpkin butter
402000	404000	Pumpkin bread mix, pumpkin
404000	406000	And, um, pumpkin macaroons
406000	408000	I saw those in the, it's
408000	410000	What? Yeah, oh yeah, you wanna try one?
410000	412000	I need to read the label
412000	414000	Oh wait, yeah, you're on a diet, nevermind
414000	416000	I should be encouraging
416000	418000	Let me read the label to see if it's good
418000	420000	Okay, go check the freezer
420000	422000	Burger King is better than McDonald's
422000	424000	Yes, I 100% agree
424000	426000	Unfortunately there is like four McDonald's on the way here
426000	428000	And one Burger King
428000	430000	And I just don't feel like stopping off the freeway
430000	432000	To stop at the Burger King
432000	434000	If the McDonald's by me was a Burger King
434000	436000	I'd be stopping at Burger King
436000	438000	Because I like Burger King way better than McDonald's
438000	440000	Just FYI, I'd be able to have one
440000	444000	If I wasn't so close already to my limit, so
444000	446000	Aw, next week
446000	448000	If they're not gone
449000	451000	Alright, you can do it
451000	453000	Alright, uh, let's see
453000	455000	I had a kickoff topic for tonight
455000	457000	I don't know how successful this will be
457000	459000	But I was thinking, you know, we're getting into the Halloween
459000	461000	Season like full swing now
461000	463000	And, uh, I don't know about you guys
463000	465000	I'm not seeing as many like
465000	467000	Costume stores this year
467000	469000	Last year seemed like there was one on every corner
469000	471000	This year I'm not seeing as many
471000	473000	No, I'm not seeing as many
473000	475000	Maybe it's just the normal locations I see them at
475000	477000	I've seen quite a few
477000	479000	Well, I thought I would ask
479000	481000	What good video game costumes
481000	483000	You might be seeing out there
483000	485000	Are you seeing anything gaming inspired
485000	487000	And what types of great
487000	489000	Gaming costumes have you seen in the past
489000	491000	But this is a tricky subject
491000	493000	Because my mind always goes to these great
493000	495000	Gaming cosplays I've seen before
495000	497000	Which technically is a little different than Halloween
497000	501000	Yeah, it's just Halloween is the day that cosplay is
501000	503000	Cosplay is Halloween for grown ups every day
503000	506000	Or every other weekend, really
506000	508000	See, the difference between cosplay
508000	510000	And Halloween is
510000	512000	Halloween you get candy
512000	514000	Cosplay you get sexually assaulted
514000	516000	I shouldn't laugh at that
516000	518000	But sadly it's true
518000	520000	Alright, um
520000	522000	So what kind of like good costumes
522000	524000	Have you guys been seeing
524000	526000	I find it interesting how Mario and Luigi
526000	528000	Have really kind of, you know
528000	530000	Gone into the mainstream
530000	532000	Well, I mean it really shouldn't be a surprise
532000	534000	Those games are obviously like landmark games
534000	536000	Like common that costume is now these days
536000	538000	When I remember growing up
538000	540000	Like if you were to dress up like Mario
540000	542000	Like nobody knew who you were
542000	544000	But it's kind of interesting that like now it's like so commonplace
544000	546000	A lot of like people dress their kids up as that
546000	548000	Um, act deaf in our chatroom
548000	550000	At live.vognetwork.com
550000	552000	Remembering Loki's Sackboy costume
552000	554000	I still have the head, I don't know where the bottom is
554000	556000	Though, but I still have the head
556000	558000	Yeah, you wore that to one of the anniversary shows
558000	560000	Or something right, that was good times
560000	562000	Was it 300 or 400, one of them
562000	564000	Good times
564000	566000	You know what I realized I still have
566000	568000	My organization 13 coat
568000	570000	So, I don't know
570000	572000	It was me and
572000	574000	Kristen and Megzi
574000	576000	We all went as our OC's
576000	578000	Our organization 13 OC's
578000	580000	Which was pretty fun
580000	582000	I do remember at Disneyland seeing a child
582000	584000	Dressed up as Sora and I was like
584000	586000	You have the coolest parents ever because
586000	588000	Like you don't see any Kingdom Hearts related stuff
588000	590000	At Disneyland anymore, which is really sad
590000	592000	Except for the pins
592000	594000	I guess now, I think there's one or two now
594000	596000	But yeah, probably just because
596000	598000	You're starting to see more and more Kingdom Hearts
598000	600000	With the game, you know, really releases
600000	602000	And leading up to three and so forth
602000	604000	I know that there's the
604000	606000	Organization 13 Mickey
606000	608000	And then there's one other that I haven't been able to find
608000	610000	Yeah, I've seen the Organization 13 Mickey
610000	612000	But, be interesting
612000	614000	It's never gonna happen, Regent Air
614000	616000	What's Regent Air saying? Loki's Tingle costume?
616000	618000	No, I think that's a lost cause
618000	620000	We gave up on that
620000	622000	Now don't get me wrong, I have the build for that
622000	624000	But it's just not gonna happen
624000	626000	I just don't want to buy that much spandex
628000	630000	What's your kid going as this year?
630000	632000	Are you doing anything gaming?
632000	634000	He's a firework
634000	636000	Oh wait, that's right, you mentioned that on a previous episode
636000	638000	Yeah, my sister is building the costume for that
638000	640000	Although, I'm wondering though
640000	642000	If they're not gonna know what he is
642000	644000	Because the
644000	646000	Costume kind of looks like a black t-shirt
646000	648000	With garland wrapped around it
648000	650000	And then he's gonna have a hat with
650000	652000	Kind of
652000	654000	I don't know what you'd call it
654000	656000	Not garland
656000	658000	But kind of the stars and stuff
658000	660000	Popping off of it
660000	662000	Not really streamers, but they have the stiff
662000	664000	Wire
664000	666000	Not really garland, but decoration stuff
666000	668000	Where the stars and things
668000	670000	Like those things you get at the dollar store
670000	672000	Yeah, I've seen wrapped in gifts and stuff
672000	674000	Yeah, stuff you would kind of picture
674000	676000	4th of July
676000	678000	He's gonna have that
678000	680000	You should have stars and stripes
680000	682000	Forever playing wherever he walks
682000	684000	That's what he's gonna do
684000	686000	I'm not doing a costume this year
686000	688000	Just because
688000	690000	I'm just not feeling it
690000	692000	I don't have anyone to dress up with
692000	694000	It's because they had to go and lay off all my friends
694000	696000	That's my boss
696000	698000	Cool, I get to hang out with my boss
698000	700000	No, I'm just not gonna do anything
700000	702000	I just don't care
702000	704000	This Halloween, it's weird
704000	706000	It's the first Halloween I've had in a while
706000	708000	Where I don't have something with Rocky or a picture show going on
708000	710000	Because that all finished up weeks early this year
710000	712000	So I don't really have anything this year
712000	714000	I did get invited to a party
714000	716000	That's right after Halloween
716000	718000	That's still a dress up party
718000	720000	Something that Captain Spike
720000	722000	Is doing
722000	724000	The theme is around internet memes
724000	726000	That sounds awesome
726000	728000	I know what I'm doing
728000	730000	But I'm not gonna say because I know Captain Spike
730000	732000	Does this occasionally so I don't wanna spoil it
732000	734000	Because it's gotta be a surprise
734000	736000	I'll take you guys off air because I think you guys
736000	738000	Get a kick out of it
738000	740000	Let's see, go into our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com
740000	742000	BobbyBlackWolf says
742000	744000	A vog starter
744000	746000	Buy the spandex for Loki
746000	748000	I'm not
748000	750000	You're gonna need a lot of money
750000	752000	No, don't buy spandex
752000	754000	For Loki
754000	756000	No offense
756000	758000	I think the world would be a better place
758000	760000	But then we can get the glamour shots
760000	762000	Come on
762000	764000	Let's see, codeband
764000	766000	In our chatroom says
766000	768000	Trying to convince my wife to let me dress our daughter up
768000	770000	As a white mage
770000	772000	Oh I saw the pictures of the concept stuff
772000	774000	That would be pretty awesome
774000	776000	That's adorable
776000	778000	A little baby white mage
778000	780000	Well not baby but toddler white mage
780000	782000	It's pretty cute
782000	784000	I'm sure this is something that they have
784000	786000	A white mage hoodie
786000	788000	You have a white
788000	790000	Plain hoodie thing and then you put the
790000	792000	Fringe on it
792000	794000	I don't know how
794000	796000	Convincing it would look but something like that
796000	798000	Alright
798000	800000	It really
800000	802000	Actually wouldn't be that hard because
802000	804000	To do one of the concepts of a white mage
804000	806000	Your basic robe would be
806000	808000	A pretty big circle skirt
808000	810000	With sleeves sewn on
810000	812000	And then just a hoodie top
812000	814000	It really would be that easy
814000	816000	I didn't have a pattern for one that I was going to do
816000	818000	As a cosplay eventually
818000	820000	But never did
820000	822000	It doesn't seem like it depends what kind of white mage
822000	824000	You're going for
824000	826000	It wouldn't be too difficult
826000	828000	If you're trying to go as Yuna that might be a little trickier
828000	830000	Because you have to get the right colors and all that
830000	832000	And you also have to be
832000	834000	Anorexic
834000	836000	She's also not a white mage
836000	838000	She's a summoner
838000	840000	She's summoner slash white mage
840000	842000	If you were going to be a white mage then you would have to be
842000	844000	Oh yeah yeah
844000	846000	Alright
846000	848000	Or that bitch face Aerith
848000	850000	Let's get into
850000	852000	How was your gaming week and the types of video games
852000	854000	That you've been playing this week
854000	856000	Dark Sakura what have you been up to?
856000	858000	I played more fractal
858000	860000	It's just my chill out kind of game
860000	862000	So I love it
862000	864000	I'm playing more Bejeweled
864000	866000	I actually broke a million points twice
866000	868000	On one of the modes
868000	870000	Which is actually kind of difficult
870000	872000	I played Final Fantasy 14
872000	874000	Which I am at
874000	876000	The Bukake Manor
876000	878000	Or was it Hauke
878000	880000	Hauke Manor yeah
880000	882000	And so I need help
882000	884000	Doing that one eventually
884000	886000	And what else did I play
886000	888000	I actually played
888000	890000	Mass Effect 2
890000	892000	Because Becky
892000	894000	Has this thing for me using the high res mod
894000	896000	Well not really doing the high res mod
896000	898000	But I do the high res mod anyway
898000	900000	To take screen caps for her
900000	902000	Of her shepherd
902000	904000	So that she can have pretty pictures
904000	906000	So that's what I did
906000	908000	And then I'm actually playing through
908000	910000	I'm trying to finish my game on three
910000	912000	Just because I'm like I should finish it
912000	914000	But that and I need more screen cap fodder
914000	916000	Because I'm really
916000	918000	Really really really running out of ideas
918000	920000	For my stupid caption
920000	922000	Bullshit
922000	924000	And yes
924000	926000	Bitch face Aerith
926000	928000	That was from our chat room
928000	930000	And I do not name Aerith bitch face
930000	932000	I name her Aerith with a T H
932000	934000	But she's still bitch face in my esteem
934000	936000	I played something
936000	938000	Animal Crossing
938000	940000	And I feel bad because I was going to open my village tonight
940000	942000	And I left it at home
942000	944000	So sorry
944000	946000	I have three characters in my village now
946000	948000	I have Sakura, I have Tsubasa
948000	950000	Who I made just for the sole purpose of redecoration
950000	952000	And making Ed move
952000	954000	Because Ed's fucking creepy
954000	956000	Did it work?
956000	958000	No, he's still fucking there, the shit
958000	960000	And I made a character for Julian
960000	962000	For Becky's son
962000	964000	Oh nice
964000	966000	I may have mentioned this before
966000	968000	He sits with me when I play the game over there
968000	970000	And he practices his reading
970000	972000	With Animal Crossing
972000	974000	So I have to, you know, skip past kitty fuck
974000	976000	And, you know, poot
976000	978000	Well, poot's okay
978000	980000	But I have to skip past the one that says pussy
980000	982000	The naughty language
982000	984000	Fuck and all that
984000	986000	So, um
986000	988000	He used to laugh his head off at
988000	990000	Pork Sword and he had no idea
990000	992000	Oh wow
992000	994000	And I can't
994000	996000	Take credit for that one, that actually came from
996000	998000	One of Queen Semiya's characters that moved into my village
998000	1000000	That was hilarious
1000000	1002000	So yeah, lots of Animal Crossing
1002000	1004000	And, um
1004000	1006000	Dan
1006000	1008000	Busted out the Ness
1008000	1010000	And played Kickle Cubicle
1010000	1012000	Kickle Cubicle
1012000	1014000	It's just the way you say kickle that makes it
1014000	1016000	Sort of come out the other way
1016000	1018000	I remember that game
1018000	1020000	So now that we have the Ness hooked up
1020000	1022000	I'm actually gonna be playing
1022000	1024000	I'm thinking about trying to rebuild my skills in Guardian Legend
1024000	1026000	Nothing wrong with that
1026000	1028000	I am going to be in tears for the next month
1028000	1030000	Until I remember how to play that damn game
1030000	1032000	Because that game's fucking hard
1032000	1034000	It is hard, but it's such a good reward
1034000	1036000	I've beaten that game so many times when I was like
1036000	1038000	13
1038000	1040000	There you go
1040000	1042000	Alright, Loki, how was your gaming week?
1042000	1044000	I just played Grand Theft Auto 5
1044000	1046000	Of course, that's all I played
1046000	1048000	But we had our fog game nights
1048000	1050000	Yeah, I was hearing some good stuff about that on Twitter, how'd that go?
1050000	1052000	Well, the first night
1052000	1054000	When I was doing PS3
1054000	1056000	I was trying to do video capture
1056000	1058000	And I have the Elgato capture thing
1058000	1060000	But for some damn reason it would not
1060000	1062000	Pick up the Playstation 3
1062000	1064000	Even through the component cables
1064000	1066000	Which is weird though, because I thought I had another set of component cables
1066000	1068000	Maybe I'm just doing it wrong or something
1068000	1070000	I thought I had one that was
1070000	1072000	The Playstation, actually
1072000	1074000	The multi-AV input
1074000	1076000	It was just that to
1076000	1078000	The Elgato
1078000	1080000	I can't find that, so I used
1080000	1082000	The component thing
1082000	1084000	That did not work out at all
1084000	1086000	It just could not detect it for some reason
1086000	1088000	But it was being finicky
1088000	1090000	Even with my Xbox 360 is doing the same
1090000	1092000	Kind of bullshit
1092000	1094000	Kind of skipped capturing that stuff
1094000	1096000	It's okay though, because we only had about
1096000	1098000	Two people I think the first night
1098000	1100000	Then on
1100000	1102000	Friday we did the second
1102000	1104000	Game night, which was on the
1104000	1106000	Xbox 360 version of Grand Theft Auto Online
1106000	1108000	That was a great turn out, we had about four or five people
1108000	1110000	Including Bobby
1110000	1112000	And we basically
1112000	1114000	Bobby didn't want to do any death matches
1114000	1116000	So we just did races
1116000	1118000	And parachute drops
1118000	1120000	And then
1120000	1122000	The one I think I had the most fun with
1122000	1124000	Was Top Fun
1124000	1126000	And Top Fun is basically
1126000	1128000	It's a team game
1128000	1130000	One team is in jets
1130000	1132000	And the other team is in cars
1132000	1134000	Cars are motorcycles usually
1134000	1136000	And they have to get from one point
1136000	1138000	To another point on the map
1138000	1140000	Without getting killed by the people in the jets
1140000	1142000	And it was a pretty
1142000	1144000	Intense gameplay
1144000	1146000	There was one where we had some other people join in with us
1146000	1148000	And we had all died
1148000	1150000	And then we were just watching this guy
1150000	1152000	Just haul ass through
1152000	1154000	The entire
1154000	1156000	Los Santos area
1156000	1158000	And there was this one where he hit a jump
1158000	1160000	Somehow and dodged two missiles
1160000	1162000	And thankfully I had the foresight
1162000	1164000	To capture everything
1164000	1166000	So I have that all recorded and I'll be cutting
1166000	1168000	A highlight reel
1168000	1170000	The only thing that kind of sucks is I didn't manage to record
1170000	1172000	My voice when I'm talking over voice chat
1172000	1174000	So you hear a lot of one sided conversations
1174000	1176000	But
1176000	1178000	Next time we'll be prepared for that
1178000	1180000	4 hours of stuff I have to cut through
1180000	1182000	So are you going to do it again next week?
1182000	1184000	Or is this a one to one thing or what?
1184000	1186000	It may not be next week but maybe in a couple weeks
1186000	1188000	We'll do it again
1188000	1190000	I don't know
1190000	1192000	I had a lot of fun
1192000	1194000	I think we leveled up about 5 levels
1194000	1196000	Just playing that
1196000	1198000	It was great
1198000	1200000	It's hard though because I know
1200000	1202000	People on the east coast and stuff
1202000	1204000	It's really late and Bobby goes up to 3 in the morning
1204000	1206000	Because we played until almost midnight
1206000	1208000	He's always up that late though
1208000	1210000	He runs on west coast time
1210000	1212000	Even though he's over there in Atlanta
1212000	1214000	So I'm going to try to do it again
1214000	1216000	Because I'm really limited in my window
1216000	1218000	Of time
1218000	1220000	To actually play
1220000	1222000	Because I have to wait for my son to go to sleep
1222000	1224000	But yeah I'll definitely do it again
1226000	1228000	But yeah it was a lot of fun
1228000	1230000	Aside from playing Grand Theft Auto online
1230000	1232000	Those couple times
1232000	1234000	I also did play some of the single player
1234000	1236000	Almost 86% done
1236000	1238000	With my 100%
1238000	1240000	Storyline stuff
1240000	1242000	I did the rest of the missions I had left
1242000	1244000	And I did all of the
1244000	1246000	Well some more of the
1246000	1248000	What was it?
1248000	1250000	Off road races
1250000	1252000	And assassination missions
1252000	1254000	And then some of the
1254000	1256000	Tonya
1256000	1258000	Towing missions
1258000	1260000	But the last one she has isn't triggered yet
1260000	1262000	That's the only thing I'm waiting on
1262000	1264000	To get all my strangers and freaks stuff done
1266000	1268000	But yeah it's been a lot of fun
1268000	1270000	And I'm trying to get the 100%
1270000	1272000	So I can start doing that chili ad mystery stuff
1272000	1274000	And
1274000	1276000	I'll definitely be playing more online
1276000	1278000	Especially more on 360
1278000	1280000	Because my co-workers flaked on me
1280000	1282000	I had one of my co-workers up here
1282000	1284000	On the Thursday night game
1284000	1286000	So we played but
1286000	1288000	I was the only one that had a headset that day
1288000	1290000	So that was kind of difficult to get people together
1290000	1292000	And he didn't really know how to join games
1292000	1294000	So it was kind of
1294000	1296000	Unorganized
1296000	1298000	But maybe the next time it'll be a little bit better
1298000	1300000	When we have more people playing
1300000	1302000	But yeah the one
1302000	1304000	Major gripe I have with
1304000	1306000	Grand Theft Auto online is just that
1306000	1308000	You know if you're getting dumped
1308000	1310000	Back into the main world again
1310000	1312000	Unless you're doing what we did throughout most of it
1312000	1314000	Where we just went from job to job to job to job
1314000	1316000	You get all
1316000	1318000	Split up
1318000	1320000	You get to constantly re-invite people back into your game
1320000	1322000	Just to keep everyone in the same world
1322000	1324000	But we had a lot of fun
1324000	1326000	So definitely looking forward to doing that again soon
1326000	1328000	Alright
1328000	1330000	Well be sure to let us all know when the next
1330000	1332000	Game night is for Grand Theft Auto
1332000	1334000	And in the meantime you can join the VOG
1334000	1336000	Crew right? Yeah we've got like
1336000	1338000	46 people in there last I checked
1338000	1340000	Nice, very cool
1340000	1342000	My gaming week
1342000	1344000	Didn't play as much video games as I would have liked to
1344000	1346000	This week but I did play a little bit
1346000	1348000	Playing some Final Fantasy 14
1348000	1350000	My White Mage is
1350000	1352000	An end game I don't know how many of you are playing
1352000	1354000	Final Fantasy 14 out there are an end game
1354000	1356000	But if you are an end game then you'll understand when I say
1356000	1358000	I got my Ifrit weapon
1358000	1360000	From the Primal Fight and then
1360000	1362000	Two days later got my Garuda one after
1362000	1364000	So many tries on the Ifrit one
1364000	1366000	Like two days later I get the better one from Garuda but whatever
1366000	1368000	And I finally got enough
1368000	1370000	Tombstones to get my Dark Light gear
1370000	1372000	So again if you don't play Final Fantasy 14
1372000	1374000	That probably means nothing to you
1374000	1376000	But that's what I've been kind of clunking away at there
1376000	1378000	Is grinding away the end game there
1378000	1380000	As far as other games I've played
1380000	1382000	Was playing some more Audiosurf 2
1382000	1384000	They've been adding little bits and pieces to that every day
1384000	1386000	Since it is one of those Steam Early Access games
1386000	1388000	So that's pretty cool I want to do some live streaming
1388000	1390000	Of that pretty soon because I really
1390000	1392000	Really like what they're doing with that so
1392000	1394000	I want to kind of play that for you guys
1394000	1396000	And let's see what else did I play this week
1396000	1398000	I went back
1398000	1400000	And visited Pac-Man Championship Edition
1400000	1402000	Because I don't know if you guys know
1402000	1404000	But they just came out with the Pac-Man Championship Edition Plus
1404000	1406000	Like the Plus add-on
1406000	1408000	Which is pretty much just a free patch
1408000	1410000	For Pac-Man Championship Edition
1410000	1412000	But now they have a little bit of a
1412000	1414000	Store kind of built in there so you can buy some additional skins
1414000	1416000	You can buy a couple additional
1416000	1418000	Mazes and a couple additional songs
1418000	1420000	Not a lot of stuff
1420000	1422000	But you know it's fun to go back
1422000	1424000	And kind of have a reason to play that again
1424000	1426000	And I like what they did with the Dig Dug skin
1426000	1428000	And the Rally X skin
1428000	1430000	It doesn't change the game
1430000	1432000	It just makes it look like you're playing Rally X
1432000	1434000	But it's like Pac-Man style so
1434000	1436000	I don't know I kind of like that that was something a little different there
1436000	1438000	And some of the new songs are cool too
1438000	1440000	They also have the original Championship Edition 1
1440000	1442000	Song in there so it's kind of
1442000	1444000	Neat that you can go back and play that if you want
1446000	1448000	The other new game that I've been playing
1448000	1450000	This week
1450000	1452000	Oh thank you Act F to correct me in our chatroom
1452000	1454000	Live.vognetwork.com
1454000	1456000	It's DX Plus not Championship Edition
1456000	1458000	Championship Edition was the first
1458000	1460000	DX Plus
1460000	1462000	Excuse me if I'm getting confused with all these
1462000	1464000	freaking Pac-Man games
1464000	1466000	Then we had Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man
1466000	1468000	And Junior Pac-Man and Baby Pac-Man
1468000	1470000	Yeah Pac-Mania anyway
1470000	1472000	Okay so
1472000	1474000	New game I played this week
1474000	1476000	Last week I told the hilarious
1476000	1478000	Story about how I loaned my 3DS
1478000	1480000	Out to Princess Irene who then
1480000	1482000	Went to Japan which came back from Japan
1482000	1484000	So today I was finally able to play
1484000	1486000	Pokemon Y
1486000	1488000	I will play a lot of it but I will say
1488000	1490000	It is
1490000	1492000	It's about time we finally get a next gen
1492000	1494000	Pokemon game because
1494000	1496000	This is the first time I've played a Pokemon game
1496000	1498000	In a while where I'm like
1498000	1500000	Oh wow this looks really good
1500000	1502000	This looks like it's running on the
1502000	1504000	Current hardware because let's face it
1504000	1506000	Black 2 and White 2 and Black and White
1506000	1508000	Were not up to par
1508000	1510000	With where the DS was at at that point
1510000	1512000	And that's probably part of the
1512000	1514000	Or probably the decision to
1514000	1516000	Make those games DS and not
1516000	1518000	3DS probably plays into that
1518000	1520000	A little bit but since X and Y
1520000	1522000	Are 3DS games you finally get a little
1522000	1524000	More kind of power in those games
1524000	1526000	And it's about time like
1526000	1528000	Kind of playing the game really made me
1528000	1530000	Realize like just how kind of
1530000	1532000	Behind the times
1532000	1534000	The other last
1534000	1536000	Couple series were
1536000	1538000	So yeah and I'm
1538000	1540000	I'm loving that
1540000	1542000	Within just a few minutes
1542000	1544000	Of being in the game and kind of getting
1544000	1546000	Going and going into the first area
1546000	1548000	There's already a diverse
1548000	1550000	Amount of Pokemon in the very first area
1550000	1552000	Like you're not just gonna get
1552000	1554000	A bunch of Bidoofs and Pidgeys
1554000	1556000	In the first area there's actually like
1556000	1558000	7 different Pokemon like enough where
1558000	1560000	You're already sending Pokemon to the box
1560000	1562000	Within the first little zone
1562000	1564000	Is the box like putting them to sleep?
1564000	1566000	No it's putting them in the computer is
1566000	1568000	What it is and there's a
1568000	1570000	Pikachu in the very first zone
1570000	1572000	And you know that's the type of
1572000	1574000	Pokemon that people really want
1574000	1576000	People don't go into a Pokemon game going
1576000	1578000	I really want a Pidgey
1578000	1580000	Or I really want a ZigZagZoon or I don't know
1580000	1582000	Maybe you do but most people don't
1582000	1584000	Most people want Pikachu
1584000	1586000	They want the cute stuff
1586000	1588000	Oh hell no I want that dark dog
1588000	1590000	Looking one I think it's awesome
1590000	1592000	So
1592000	1594000	Anyhow I like that there was already
1594000	1596000	That diversity and so forth
1596000	1598000	And again the combat looks great
1598000	1600000	The only downer is if you're playing
1600000	1602000	Combat in 3D mode
1602000	1604000	Very noticeable dip in quality
1604000	1606000	And I'm sure you've heard this a lot of places
1606000	1608000	But I'm telling you too
1608000	1610000	Very noticeable dip in quality
1610000	1612000	It's almost as if this game was made for the 2DS
1612000	1614000	Honestly
1614000	1616000	And I kind of think it was in some regards
1616000	1618000	And I think most people will be playing it with the 3D off
1618000	1620000	Because like when you're walking around the map
1620000	1622000	And everything it doesn't even really
1622000	1624000	Doesn't really use the 3D
1624000	1626000	It only uses the 3D in the battles and maybe
1626000	1628000	Like in the opening and things like that
1628000	1630000	That's really it but I mean that doesn't really affect the game
1630000	1632000	At the end of the day but it is a very
1632000	1634000	Interesting sign for
1634000	1636000	Maybe this 3DS
1636000	1638000	Or 3D thing is
1638000	1640000	Gonna be gone a little sooner than we think
1640000	1642000	They tricked you into buying another Gameboy didn't they
1642000	1644000	No I did not buy
1644000	1646000	I waited for Irene to bring my other 3DS back
1646000	1648000	No I'm just saying that
1648000	1650000	You know the whole thing remember
1650000	1652000	The thing that Nintendo is really good about is getting
1652000	1654000	People to buy the Gameboy over and over and over again
1654000	1656000	They'll have the Gameboy, the Gameboy Color, the Gameboy Pocket
1656000	1658000	You know the Gameboy Advance
1658000	1660000	SP and so on and so forth
1660000	1662000	Different colors
1662000	1664000	The DS, the DSi, the DSi XL
1664000	1666000	The 3DS which is
1666000	1668000	Basically a DS anyways
1668000	1670000	And now they're like oh hey
1670000	1672000	We don't really need the 3D anymore
1672000	1674000	So it's basically a fancy DS
1674000	1676000	They got you to buy another DS which in turn
1676000	1678000	Is basically a Gameboy Advance which is
1678000	1680000	A Gameboy
1680000	1682000	I will say this it's not coming up in tonight's news
1682000	1684000	Other stuff to talk about but
1684000	1686000	There is that 3DS XL with the
1686000	1688000	Legend of Zelda the two Triforces
1688000	1690000	In the top and bottom that 3DS XL
1690000	1692000	Is coming out
1692000	1694000	It was in the leaked GameStop Black Friday
1694000	1696000	Ad I'm really hoping
1696000	1698000	It is not a GameStop exclusive
1698000	1700000	I don't know at this point
1700000	1702000	Please don't please don't be
1702000	1704000	An exclusive because I really want one
1704000	1706000	But I won't buy it if it's a GameStop
1706000	1708000	Exclusive I won't buy it
1708000	1710000	But I probably will buy that
1710000	1712000	Because I'm a consumer whore
1712000	1714000	Or more like
1714000	1716000	I haven't been this excited for a Zelda game
1716000	1718000	In a very long time like the fact that they're making
1718000	1720000	A sequel to Link to the Past I'm like yes please
1720000	1722000	Admit one please
1722000	1724000	So I'm definitely looking forward to that
1724000	1726000	However this whole fact that
1726000	1728000	Some of the games are really just saying
1728000	1730000	Ah fuck 3D that are coming from Nintendo
1730000	1732000	Well I guess technically Pokemon
1732000	1734000	Is not a first party Nintendo game but it's like a second
1734000	1736000	Party it's like
1736000	1738000	It's first party they own the company that makes it
1738000	1740000	But Pokemon Company is in a really weird place
1740000	1742000	Because don't forget Pokemon Company makes iPhone
1742000	1744000	Apps too which is something Nintendo refuses to do
1744000	1746000	Oh no I guess they're going to make Miiverse though
1746000	1748000	I guess maybe that is changing
1748000	1750000	It's first party
1750000	1752000	Well whatever it is
1752000	1754000	It's still you know
1754000	1756000	It's still interesting
1756000	1758000	Anyway I'm very
1758000	1760000	Curious to see what's going to happen next
1760000	1762000	With the DS and I'm kind of wondering if we're
1762000	1764000	Going to see a new DS like I don't know if we
1764000	1766000	Would see like a new full DS next
1766000	1768000	Next year but I kind of I just feel like
1768000	1770000	It wouldn't be Nintendo if we didn't get some
1770000	1772000	Sort of handheld next year you know what I mean
1772000	1774000	We got the 2DS this year which you know whatever
1774000	1776000	I'm really curious what happens next year
1776000	1778000	Is it going to be the 2DS and the clam shell that
1778000	1780000	Everybody wants or is it going to be like
1780000	1782000	3DS XL Uber
1782000	1784000	Or something you know I'm so curious
1784000	1786000	Tablet
1786000	1788000	It's already one screen you just take the little
1788000	1790000	Middle the middle thing out of the
1790000	1792000	Out of the way and then there you go
1792000	1794000	You have one giant screen that you
1794000	1796000	Can play 2DS games on or
1796000	1798000	3DS games whatever you want to call them
1798000	1800000	So a Nintendo iPad
1800000	1802000	And then basically the whole thing is a touch screen
1802000	1804000	So you can run these you know games that are that big
1804000	1806000	Or I don't know they'll allow
1806000	1808000	You to run 3DS games on your
1808000	1810000	Wii U
1810000	1812000	Because that's going to happen
1812000	1814000	Eventually I will say it
1814000	1816000	Again and again it's going to happen
1816000	1818000	Maybe every single week but eventually it'll happen
1818000	1820000	I'll be like see I told you so
1820000	1822000	Or it won't ever happen
1822000	1824000	And you'll just forget you ever said anything
1824000	1826000	So alright so yeah Pokemon Y
1826000	1828000	I'm enjoying it I'm going to play a little more
1828000	1830000	Way more into it than I was
1830000	1832000	Black or Black 2 or any of the
1832000	1834000	Previous Pokemon games that I have been playing
1834000	1836000	So I'll let you know how that goes
1836000	1838000	I'll let you know if I actually am able to stick with it
1838000	1840000	To beat a few gym leaders
1840000	1842000	Or if I end up giving it up and going back to MMOs full time
1842000	1844000	We'll see
1844000	1846000	Alright over at live.vognetwork.com
1846000	1848000	Techness in our chatroom says
1848000	1850000	I remember playing yellow
1850000	1852000	It was pretty much yay I finally have a Pikachu
1852000	1854000	Then it became crap he's useless
1854000	1856000	When you hit the first gym and end up wasting time
1856000	1858000	Leveling up some mediocre grass type
1858000	1860000	Yeah kind of
1860000	1862000	Is the one bummer about Pokemon games sometimes
1862000	1864000	Is that you don't necessarily get to really
1864000	1866000	Play with that starter if
1866000	1868000	You know the gym you want to fight is
1868000	1870000	Strong to that type but there's
1870000	1872000	Such a diversity you usually find something else
1872000	1874000	You like like I think it's I started with
1874000	1876000	Fennekin obviously but then when I got that
1876000	1878000	Pikachu in the first zone I was like hell yeah
1878000	1880000	So now I have a Pikachu
1880000	1882000	And then I like to have a Pidgey too
1882000	1884000	Because they have the air attack and all that
1884000	1886000	Although he'll probably get replaced later
1886000	1888000	But for now you know so
1888000	1890000	Anyway
1890000	1892000	Let's see going to the chatroom
1892000	1894000	At live.vognetwork.com
1894000	1896000	Codeman suggests the Nintendo 4DS
1896000	1898000	You move with the game
1898000	1900000	Now if you were going to go fourth dimension
1900000	1902000	It'd have to be time travel
1902000	1904000	Which is already available in Animal Crossing
1904000	1906000	And technically the
1906000	1908000	3DS has a gyroscope in it so
1908000	1910000	It kind of does detect motion it counts your steps
1910000	1912000	Right remember that
1912000	1914000	Alright so there you go
1914000	1916000	Alright before we get into
1916000	1918000	Some housekeeping and our
1918000	1920000	Gaming news I'll take another question
1920000	1922000	Here from Jimbo in our chatroom
1922000	1924000	At live.vognetwork.com says
1924000	1926000	Are Sky, Loki, and Dark Sakura all getting
1926000	1928000	The new systems?
1928000	1930000	Good question are we getting the new
1930000	1932000	Systems? We're likely
1932000	1934000	Getting a PS4
1934000	1936000	But I need a job
1936000	1938000	I still have a
1938000	1940000	PlayStation 4 on pre-order
1940000	1942000	Although we're going to get into some news here
1942000	1944000	Very shortly that kind of makes me
1944000	1946000	Make a sad face when it comes to that
1946000	1948000	I mean I'll still get it but yeah
1948000	1950000	Loki? Not at launch
1950000	1952000	Not at launch? I'm not getting it
1952000	1954000	Launch accounts on my pre-order sorry
1954000	1956000	Or pre-order because I didn't pre-order
1956000	1958000	The Xbox one please
1958000	1960000	Alright
1960000	1962000	Going to our housekeeping
1963000	1965000	Just want to tease that we

1967000	1969000	And our Twitter
1969000	1971000	So please be our friend
1971000	1973000	On those sites
1973000	1975000	Also just letting you know and this may be news
1975000	1977000	To my co-host too sorry about it
1977000	1979000	But there may not be a show November
1979000	1981000	10th it's looking like I'm going to be out
1981000	1983000	Of town thanks to Blizzcon
1983000	1985000	Even though I'm not going
1985000	1987000	I'm not going to Blizzcon
1987000	1989000	I'm going to Blizzcon and I'm going to the Blizzcon
1989000	1990000	Parties
1990000	1992000	So may not be a show
1992000	1994000	November 10th unless I'm able to rush home and be
1994000	1996000	Here in time we'll see
1996000	1998000	Just letting you know in advance but we still
1998000	2000000	Have a couple weeks of show before we get there
2000000	2002000	Alright let's get into gaming news
2002000	2004000	And Loki some of the sad
2004000	2006000	News for Playstation 4
2006000	2008000	Awaitors this week right?
2008000	2010000	It was bound to happen but games
2010000	2012000	Are being delayed I'm not too
2012000	2014000	Surprised by this Watchdogs has been
2014000	2016000	Delayed to Spring 2014
2016000	2018000	And the reason why I'm not surprised by this is
2018000	2020000	Because Ubisoft has a ton of fucking titles coming
2020000	2022000	Out in the fourth quarter including
2022000	2024000	Assassin's Creed 4 and South Park
2024000	2026000	Among them
2026000	2028000	So to have Watchdogs
2028000	2030000	Coming out at the same time I mean Watchdogs
2030000	2032000	Is almost kind of competing with Assassin's Creed
2032000	2034000	So why would they want to compete with themselves?
2034000	2036000	Might as well just put out your game
2036000	2038000	In a slower period of the year
2038000	2040000	And polish it up
2040000	2042000	Even more even though it does kind of suck
2042000	2044000	For people that were hoping to
2044000	2046000	Buy that as a next gen game
2046000	2048000	When I was actually thinking about getting a Playstation 4
2048000	2050000	That would have been one of the titles I would have probably picked up
2050000	2052000	For it but
2052000	2054000	Yeah I guess we just got the
2054000	2056000	Wait right now it's expected to be
2056000	2058000	Hitting in the next financial year
2058000	2060000	Which I believe they're estimating that
2060000	2062000	To be second quarter
2062000	2064000	Of 2014
2064000	2066000	Also to go along with
2066000	2068000	That the crew has been delayed
2068000	2070000	To mid 2014
2070000	2072000	And you know
2072000	2074000	Around the I guess
2074000	2076000	Summer period so that
2076000	2078000	Runs July 2014 to
2078000	2080000	September 2014
2080000	2082000	And
2082000	2084000	I'm not surprised I mean I don't even think they really had
2084000	2086000	A date for that other than I think it was supposed to be
2086000	2088000	Early 2014 so
2088000	2090000	Whatever one is kind of disappointing
2090000	2092000	Though Sony one of their
2092000	2094000	First party
2094000	2096000	Launch titles has been delayed Drive Club
2096000	2098000	Which was supposed to be one of those
2098000	2100000	Games they actually got at least a
2100000	2102000	Somewhat complete
2102000	2104000	Version of for
2104000	2106000	Playstation Plus now you're just gonna have to wait
2106000	2108000	To play it early 2014 for that
2108000	2110000	That one stings a little bit
2110000	2112000	That was the one I think a lot of people
2112000	2114000	Were looking forward to you know driving games
2114000	2116000	Are usually a great way to show off
2116000	2118000	The graphical oomph of a new system
2118000	2120000	So that one hurts a little bit
2120000	2122000	I mean I guess there's still Need for Speed
2122000	2124000	But
2124000	2126000	Yeah but this is more of I think it's more of
2126000	2128000	Simulation racing so
2128000	2130000	Need for Speed is definitely arcade
2130000	2132000	It's not necessarily like
2132000	2134000	4 is a 5 or something
2134000	2136000	Maybe Gran Turismo 6 but that's
2136000	2138000	Playstation 3
2138000	2140000	I think with all this stuff kind of
2140000	2142000	Being delayed once again it makes it also
2142000	2144000	A hard sell for a next gen system because
2144000	2146000	A lot of these games that are coming out
2146000	2148000	There's not a whole ton of exclusives
2148000	2150000	For these next gen systems at
2150000	2152000	Launch and there's still
2152000	2154000	Really good games coming out on current gen
2154000	2156000	I mean right now
2156000	2158000	Gran Turismo 5 is not on
2158000	2160000	Next gen, Gran Turismo 6 is not
2160000	2162000	On next gen
2162000	2164000	You know there's
2164000	2166000	Plenty of games out there that
2166000	2168000	They don't have next gen versions for and
2168000	2170000	Call of Duty let's be honest it's probably not going to be
2170000	2172000	That much better on Playstation 4
2172000	2174000	Or Xbox One aside from
2174000	2176000	Graphics it'll probably look nicer
2176000	2178000	You know it's also interesting that
2178000	2180000	Big controversy
2180000	2182000	A couple weeks ago when Sony delayed
2182000	2184000	The Playstation 4 in Japan
2184000	2186000	To next year because they said
2186000	2188000	You know what we're really not going to have games out
2188000	2190000	Available for it this holiday
2190000	2192000	And now it's kind of looking like
2192000	2194000	Yeah maybe that is
2194000	2196000	The case you know
2196000	2198000	I was curious what games
2198000	2200000	Are going to be out at launch
2200000	2202000	What is going to be out on the Playstation 4
2202000	2204000	I have a partial list here on wiki
2204000	2206000	This is wikipedia
2206000	2208000	I have mine full list up in my head
2208000	2210000	Okay so as far as
2210000	2212000	I can only really speak to North America because I have no idea
2212000	2214000	No that's fine that's what I want to know
2214000	2216000	So first party titles
2216000	2218000	Are going to be coming out you have of course Killzone
2218000	2220000	Shadow Fall
2220000	2222000	You have Knack
2222000	2224000	And that's
2224000	2226000	Pretty much it actually
2226000	2228000	That is it since Drive Club
2228000	2230000	Fell off that's it
2230000	2232000	Third party you've got Call of Duty
2232000	2234000	Assassin's Creed 4, Battlefield 4
2234000	2236000	Need for Speed
2236000	2238000	NBA Live
2238000	2240000	NBA 2K14
2240000	2242000	There's also
2242000	2244000	What was the other ones here
2244000	2246000	There was
2246000	2248000	Something no one's going to really pick up
2248000	2250000	Skylanders, Swap Force
2250000	2252000	Lego Marvel Super Heroes
2252000	2254000	Angry Birds Star Wars
2254000	2256000	The only ones
2256000	2258000	I'm not hearing is
2258000	2260000	Need for Speed Rivals
2260000	2262000	Did you Just Dance 2014
2262000	2264000	Yeah Just Dance 2014 is coming out
2264000	2266000	You said one of the NBA games
2266000	2268000	But there's two on the list
2268000	2270000	NBA Live which is next to
2270000	2272000	exclusive and NBA 2K14
2272000	2274000	Now there are some
2274000	2276000	Network games too
2276000	2278000	Which I know you wouldn't be as up on
2278000	2280000	But there's things like Contrast
2280000	2282000	Divekick
2282000	2284000	Minecraft and Pinball Arcade
2284000	2286000	Resogun is another one
2286000	2288000	Those are all things that are set to be
2288000	2290000	Available on Playstation Network
2290000	2292000	Injustice also
2292000	2294000	Injustice Ultimate Edition
2294000	2296000	That's right
2296000	2298000	And Injustice
2298000	2300000	Injustice, at least the next gen version
2300000	2302000	Is exclusive to the Playstation 4
2302000	2304000	So they do have that I guess
2306000	2308000	I was going to say also
2308000	2310000	Xbox One
2310000	2312000	They still have a decent lineup
2312000	2314000	They've got all three of their games
2314000	2316000	I was just going to say, Xbox One
2316000	2318000	As much as they've been getting the short end of the stick
2318000	2320000	With their popularity on the internet
2320000	2322000	Some things they do have
2322000	2324000	That they're going to have on the 22nd
2324000	2326000	They will have Crimson Dragon
2326000	2328000	Dead Rising 3
2328000	2330000	Forza Motorsport 5
2330000	2332000	Killer Instinct, although I kind of
2332000	2334000	I've got to be honest, I don't care about Killer Instinct anymore
2334000	2336000	Rise
2336000	2338000	And let's see, Power Star Golf
2338000	2340000	It says it's exclusive
2340000	2342000	The Xbox Fitness game as well
2342000	2344000	There's also the Zumba Fitness game
2344000	2346000	And yeah
2346000	2348000	And then a lot of those same third party games
2348000	2350000	We've already mentioned before
2350000	2352000	I mean, Xbox, it's funny
2352000	2354000	It really does have more exclusives
2354000	2356000	That comes out, but it's going to be interesting to see
2356000	2358000	Are people going to pay the other $100
2358000	2360000	To get in on that
2360000	2362000	And really
2362000	2364000	Are the exclusives good enough
2364000	2366000	I'm going to be honest, when I look at this list
2366000	2368000	I go, Rise
2368000	2370000	Eh, Killer Instinct
2370000	2372000	Maybe, but I don't like what I'm hearing about it
2372000	2374000	Crimson Dragon, okay yeah
2374000	2376000	I'd like to check that one out
2376000	2378000	But would that sell you a system? Probably not
2378000	2380000	I don't think so, no
2380000	2382000	Like, had it been a new Halo game
2382000	2384000	That might have tipped the scales
2384000	2386000	Had it been that Quantum Break, that definitely would have tipped the scales
2386000	2388000	So
2388000	2390000	You know
2390000	2392000	Honestly, it comes down to the third party games
2392000	2394000	For me, I think I would like to play Need for Speed
2394000	2396000	For sure
2396000	2398000	I'd like to check out the Lego game
2398000	2400000	Because usually those are pretty good
2400000	2402000	But the Lego game to me
2402000	2404000	If you really want to, it's coming out on the Wii U
2404000	2406000	About a month before it comes out on the other system
2406000	2408000	So it's not really a game that needs the next gen
2408000	2410000	Version of
2410000	2412000	Skylanders, please
2412000	2414000	That's not a game that needs the next gen version
2414000	2416000	I mean, seriously, that's going to be important
2416000	2418000	Angry Birds Star Wars
2418000	2420000	Really?
2420000	2422000	No one cared, no one cared
2422000	2424000	So
2424000	2426000	Yeah, that's kind of where it was
2426000	2428000	Even when they had their full lineups
2428000	2430000	Well, there's not really a lot that's selling me
2430000	2432000	On these next gen systems
2432000	2434000	The only first party game that looked really good
2434000	2436000	To me for Playstation 4 was Infamous
2436000	2438000	Second Son
2438000	2440000	Kind of cool
2440000	2442000	Killzone, I'm just not a fan of Killzone
2442000	2444000	If it was a new Resistance game that looked that nice
2444000	2446000	Okay, then
2446000	2448000	I would probably pick that up
2448000	2450000	I have to be honest
2450000	2452000	I almost feel like in a way I kind of have to get on board
2452000	2454000	With the next generation
2454000	2456000	Just because I have this show
2456000	2458000	And I want to be able to talk about games on the show
2458000	2460000	See, I felt that way before
2460000	2462000	The last generation
2462000	2464000	I bought all three systems
2464000	2466000	And that was a mistake because I just don't play all three systems
2466000	2468000	I don't play the Wii
2468000	2470000	And the Playstation 3 has just gotten a little bit more activity
2470000	2472000	Now that I'm playing Grand Theft Auto on both systems
2472000	2474000	But
2474000	2476000	It was pretty much collecting dust
2476000	2478000	And the Xbox 360 was the only thing I was playing on
2478000	2480000	And a lot of people now are upgrading to the Xbox One
2480000	2482000	Because they figure
2482000	2484000	Well, I've invested all this time in the Xbox 360
2484000	2486000	I might as well go along with that
2486000	2488000	To carry over my gamer score
2488000	2490000	Which really doesn't mean anything, folks
2490000	2492000	Just saying
2492000	2494000	Wouldn't your trophy information on Playstation carry over too?
2494000	2496000	Yeah, that's going to carry over too
2496000	2498000	I'm talking about the 360
2498000	2500000	So, I mean, that doesn't really count for anything
2500000	2502000	You know
2502000	2504000	I just, I can't do that anymore
2504000	2506000	And even when I do go to buy a system
2506000	2508000	I'm not going to buy
2508000	2510000	All of the different systems out there
2510000	2512000	Just because I don't have time to play all of them
2512000	2514000	And honestly, I don't want to waste money
2514000	2516000	On more than one system
2516000	2518000	So
2518000	2520000	I'll just wait and see
2520000	2522000	I'm sure the price drops will happen
2522000	2524000	Or at least there'll be more games out there
2524000	2526000	So might as well wait
2526000	2528000	For something that I really want to play
2528000	2530000	Like a next-gen version of Grand Theft Auto 5
2532000	2534000	Alright, we'll see
2534000	2536000	Anyhow
2536000	2538000	Yeah, I'm curious to see
2538000	2540000	How that all pans out this holiday season
2540000	2542000	Like what games end up being the big seller
2542000	2544000	This holiday
2544000	2546000	Because I gotta say
2546000	2548000	It's really funny, the games
2548000	2550000	I'm looking forward to the most
2550000	2552000	Are on Wii U
2552000	2554000	I would say the game I'm looking forward to
2554000	2556000	The most this holiday is
2556000	2558000	Mario 3D World 2
2558000	2560000	Or whatever they're calling it on Wii U
2560000	2562000	God, I can't even tell these games apart anymore
2562000	2564000	All I know is it's a new Mario game on Wii U
2564000	2566000	And I want
2566000	2568000	And that would be the game I'm probably looking forward to the most
2568000	2570000	So
2570000	2572000	Anyway
2572000	2574000	Speaking of Xbox One
2574000	2576000	Xbox One, not going to be doing any type of
2576000	2578000	Real name integration at launch
2578000	2580000	You're still going to be using your gamer tags
2580000	2582000	At launch, now don't
2582000	2584000	Miss-hear me here, I'm not saying that Xbox was going to
2584000	2586000	Plan to switch everybody to their real names
2586000	2588000	Although that would be hilarious for the trolls
2588000	2590000	But you know I'm not here for that either
2590000	2592000	I threw a fit
2592000	2594000	When Blizzard threatened to do it with real ID
2594000	2596000	And I threw a fit here too
2596000	2598000	Well, remember, Sony's planning on doing that
2598000	2600000	They are, but Sony's planning on doing it through your Facebook
2600000	2602000	And you can use a fake name on Facebook
2602000	2604000	You're not supposed to, but you can
2604000	2606000	They didn't steal it from your credit card
2606000	2608000	Which still rubs me the wrong way to this day
2608000	2610000	Anyway
2610000	2612000	The game tags
2612000	2614000	Are all you're going to have on Xbox One
2614000	2616000	They did say
2616000	2618000	Our teams are working hard to deliver a quality experience
2618000	2620000	For Xbox One, this means
2620000	2622000	Prioritizing some features and sometimes
2622000	2624000	Postponing others for a later
2624000	2626000	Update
2626000	2628000	Honestly, I don't miss the fact that they're not
2628000	2630000	Going to use my real name
2630000	2632000	Who cares? Not something I really want them to use
2632000	2634000	Did Xbox say it's coming off of
2634000	2636000	Facebook? Because if they get that from my credit card
2636000	2638000	I will not be happy
2638000	2640000	I would imagine it would have to come from Facebook
2640000	2642000	Because not everyone's
2642000	2644000	Going to be, they have alternate payment
2644000	2646000	Forms now, it's not all just through a credit card
2646000	2648000	I guess that's true
2648000	2650000	But just so you know, the real names are how
2650000	2652000	People are supposed to be able to search for you
2652000	2654000	Like if they want to be able to find you
2654000	2656000	Or whatever, but then I would think like, well what kind of privacy
2656000	2658000	Restrictions are they going to put in place? I kind of don't
2658000	2660000	Want people to search for my name and find me
2660000	2662000	Sorry, if I want you to find me
2662000	2664000	I'll give you my gamertag
2664000	2666000	Any listener of this show that's ever asked for it
2666000	2668000	Honestly, there's a lot of people that share my name
2668000	2670000	The upside of having real names
2670000	2672000	However, is that it removes that aspect
2672000	2674000	Of anonymity for trolls
2674000	2676000	But I don't think they're going to
2676000	2678000	See, that's where your mind goes
2678000	2680000	But I don't think they're going to show that
2680000	2682000	That would be a huge privacy thing
2682000	2684000	Or it's even worse and they are now
2684000	2686000	Able to track you down based on your real
2686000	2688000	Name and then they control you beyond
2688000	2690000	Xbox on
2690000	2692000	Facebook or
2692000	2694000	Having the
2694000	2696000	Maybe keeping the name secret
2696000	2698000	But having it for issues of just searching
2698000	2700000	If you know who you're looking for
2700000	2702000	That might be something different
2702000	2704000	However, I don't know
2704000	2706000	But yeah, I got to be honest
2706000	2708000	If I want you to find me, I'll give you my gamertag
2708000	2710000	Exactly, I don't need you to be able to
2710000	2712000	Just search for my name
2712000	2714000	Or whatever, I think what they're trying to do is
2714000	2716000	They're trying to integrate it with Facebook even tighter
2716000	2718000	So that way, you know, once you
2718000	2720000	Once it gets you to connect it one time
2720000	2722000	It's going to be like, look at all these people
2722000	2724000	You don't have on your Xbox friends list yet
2724000	2726000	But you're friends with them on Facebook
2726000	2728000	Add, add, add, add, don't you want to add them now
2728000	2730000	So you can send them cookies and
2730000	2732000	Fight with them on
2732000	2734000	Killer Instinct
2734000	2736000	And all this stuff
2736000	2738000	So
2738000	2740000	Going to our chatroom at
2740000	2742000	Live.vognetwork.com
2742000	2744000	Ragenator says, Sky, why associate
2744000	2746000	A credit card number with a system
2746000	2748000	Where there's those PSN, Wii, Xbox Live
2748000	2750000	Funds, cards that are everywhere
2750000	2752000	Cause it's an extra step
2752000	2754000	No, that's a good point
2754000	2756000	And I try not to give them that information anymore
2756000	2758000	But I think they have it on file cause my
2758000	2760000	Xbox Gold still comes from that
2760000	2762000	And historically, they would have had
2762000	2764000	That information anyway
2764000	2766000	So, there you go
2766000	2768000	S2100matt in chat says
2768000	2770000	I don't really want people to know my real name here
2770000	2772000	Sure, I want to play with people
2772000	2774000	But I don't really want people to know my real name
2774000	2776000	Yeah, I'm kind of with you and if these systems
2776000	2778000	Are going to review, either one of them
2778000	2780000	If it's unveiled that they're
2780000	2782000	Going to show the real names or whatever
2782000	2784000	I'm out, I'm not buying the system
2784000	2786000	If that crap is in there
2786000	2788000	Yes, I do want anonymity
2788000	2790000	But it's not to troll people, it's because
2790000	2792000	I play video games to escape the real world
2792000	2794000	Sometimes
2794000	2796000	So, just saying
2796000	2798000	Besides, we all know that the Xbox One is going to take
2798000	2800000	A picture of your junk and assign it to your real
2800000	2802000	And then it will have your real name on it
2802000	2804000	Just saying
2804000	2806000	Maybe Xbox should think about
2806000	2808000	Just not implementing that feature
2808000	2810000	Like, is it really that big a deal?
2810000	2812000	And even though I do have the PlayStation 4 on pre-order
2812000	2814000	I'm going to be very curious to see what happens
2814000	2816000	With those early units and what might come out about that
2816000	2818000	Anyhow
2818000	2820000	Wine, whine, complain, complain
2820000	2822000	DarkSakura
2822000	2824000	Well, for something that is not
2824000	2826000	Complain worthy, something that's actually good
2826000	2828000	Is that Squeenix said
2828000	2830000	That Kingdom Hearts 2.5 Remix
2830000	2832000	Is a compilation
2832000	2834000	HD compilation that has
2834000	2836000	The Kingdom Hearts 2 final mix, Birth by Sleep
2836000	2838000	Final mix
2838000	2840000	And the remastered cinematics from
2840000	2842000	Re-coded
2842000	2844000	And it's going to be on
2844000	2846000	PS3 and is
2846000	2848000	Going to be out in 2014
2848000	2850000	But no mention of PS4
2850000	2852000	So this will be
2852000	2854000	Coming after the 1.5 remix
2854000	2856000	So yay
2856000	2858000	More HD
2858000	2860000	More Kingdom Hearts
2860000	2862000	I
2862000	2864000	Saw that new trailer though
2864000	2866000	For Kingdom Hearts 3
2866000	2868000	Sexy
2868000	2870000	Sexy
2870000	2872000	What did I say on my friend's Facebook? I think I said
2872000	2874000	This is serving up some Big Thunder Mountain Electric Parade
2874000	2876000	Realness
2876000	2878000	Now I did watch it and I was just like
2878000	2880000	This looks like more Kingdom Hearts
2880000	2882000	I think it wasn't really Big Thunder Mountain at all
2882000	2884000	I think that train was part of the Electric Parade
2884000	2886000	Yeah, and it didn't
2886000	2888000	His name was in the corner and it didn't say Big Thunder Mountain
2888000	2890000	Granted they might call it something
2890000	2892000	Different in Japan, I don't know
2892000	2894000	But it was interesting that
2894000	2896000	Anything they did show did not incorporate
2896000	2898000	Any other Disney properties
2898000	2900000	Besides the Goofy and Donald
2900000	2902000	Sidekicks that you expect to see
2902000	2904000	Because you saw Traverse Town
2904000	2906000	And then you saw a big pirate ship
2906000	2908000	That was like flipping around in circles
2908000	2910000	And then you didn't really
2910000	2912000	Like you didn't see
2912000	2914000	Mulan World
2914000	2916000	You didn't see Tron
2916000	2918000	You didn't see 100 Acre Wood
2918000	2920000	You didn't see any of that stuff
2920000	2922000	So we still don't know exactly what's going to be represented in the game
2922000	2924000	But I figure they want to keep most of that a secret for a good long while
2924000	2926000	Well and also if I'm right
2926000	2928000	At the two Disney parks in Japan
2928000	2930000	I think that there's not a Big Thunder
2930000	2932000	I think that they've
2932000	2934000	Combined that concept with the Indiana Jones
2934000	2936000	Ride to have an outdoor roller coaster
2936000	2938000	That sometimes runs backwards
2938000	2940000	And wouldn't that be fascinating
2940000	2942000	If they had an Indiana Jones level
2942000	2944000	Something that incorporates the Lucas Arts
2944000	2946000	They technically can
2946000	2948000	They can but
2948000	2950000	Marvel? I wonder if they will
2950000	2952000	I mean that's a little bit more separate but Marvel
2952000	2954000	I think they're going to keep it Disney
2954000	2956000	To Squeenix and leave it there
2956000	2958000	I think they will too
2958000	2960000	But I could see like a very subtle
2960000	2962000	Like here comes Indiana Jones
2962000	2964000	Like I could see that like being a thing
2964000	2966000	Just like a little bit of a
2966000	2968000	Wink and a nod to some of their recent acquisitions
2968000	2970000	I think putting Marvel in there
2970000	2972000	Would be too much
2972000	2974000	That's like a completely different universe
2974000	2976000	What about Pixar stuff?
2976000	2978000	I really hope they do
2978000	2980000	I think some of the Pixar games would make for great levels
2980000	2982000	Especially with how they've been pushing
2982000	2984000	The Cars franchise
2984000	2986000	Cars Land and all that
2986000	2988000	Has been huge
2988000	2990000	For a very short ride
2990000	2992000	Oh my god
2992000	2994000	I would love to do something in the WALL-E universe
2994000	2996000	WALL-E is kind of set on Earth
2996000	2998000	So I don't know exactly what they would do with that
2998000	3000000	But we'll see
3000000	3002000	Incredibles?
3002000	3004000	I'd be cool
3004000	3006000	But yeah a lot of the Pixar stories are sort of like
3006000	3008000	They're not really about their worlds
3008000	3010000	So much as they are the characters I think
3010000	3012000	Star Wars would be cool though
3012000	3014000	Star Wars would be very cool
3014000	3016000	Dark Soccer did you see the other news about Kingdom Hearts 3?
3016000	3018000	Um
3018000	3020000	Let me uh
3020000	3022000	No
3022000	3024000	Because my iPad's being a shit again
3024000	3026000	Hold on
3026000	3028000	I believe there is a little bit more news
3028000	3030000	And of course it is something that we're pretty
3030000	3032000	Aware
3032000	3034000	Was going to happen regardless
3034000	3036000	Is that Utada Hikaru is
3036000	3038000	Well may return
3038000	3040000	For Kingdom Hearts 3
3040000	3042000	Which I think is probably going to happen
3042000	3044000	She really should I mean
3044000	3046000	But she's been on a musical hiatus or something right?
3046000	3048000	Didn't she take a break or something?
3048000	3050000	She did
3050000	3052000	But there was actually a post
3052000	3054000	That came from
3054000	3056000	Utada Teruzane
3056000	3058000	Who is his
3058000	3060000	Her dad
3060000	3062000	Who said that the two of them were
3062000	3064000	Undecided when it came to Kingdom Hearts 3
3064000	3066000	So she's
3066000	3068000	Not contributing a new theme song
3068000	3070000	But there's a chance she might help
3070000	3072000	I sure hope she does
3072000	3074000	Do something with it that would be great
3074000	3076000	Because the songs especially Simple and Clean
3076000	3078000	Was so important to Kingdom Hearts you know
3078000	3080000	Yeah
3080000	3082000	Codeman in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com
3082000	3084000	Says Wreck It Ralph World
3084000	3086000	That would be too meta
3086000	3088000	Although Sugar Rush would be pretty great
3088000	3090000	I could still see them doing that
3090000	3092000	Like a Sugar Rush level would be kind of
3092000	3094000	Like just even like instead of the gummy ship
3094000	3096000	Tangled
3096000	3098000	I could see Tangled
3098000	3100000	Oh I could totally see Tangled
3100000	3102000	I kind of hope they do that
3102000	3104000	That would be great
3104000	3106000	Have they done this yet because I liked it
3106000	3108000	I thought it was a good movie
3108000	3110000	Emperor's New Groove
3110000	3112000	I don't think they did
3112000	3114000	Let's see
3114000	3116000	SSG100Matt says
3116000	3118000	Indiana Jones in Kingdom Hearts would be better than the Crystal Skull
3118000	3120000	Well ain't that the truth
3120000	3122000	As long as
3122000	3124000	I have bars low
3124000	3126000	Shia LaBeouf is not allowed to be in Kingdom Hearts
3126000	3128000	Do not let that kid anywhere near
3128000	3130000	Kingdom Hearts
3130000	3132000	You keep Shia LaBeouf away
3132000	3134000	From Kingdom Hearts
3134000	3136000	Not gonna happen
3136000	3138000	Ooh Act Deaf is suggesting Brave
3138000	3140000	Great Pixar movie
3140000	3142000	I could totally see that as well
3142000	3144000	That would be great
3144000	3146000	We could fan wank Kingdom Hearts
3146000	3148000	Worlds all day long but the reality is
3148000	3150000	We are just not gonna know until they make
3150000	3152000	Some formal announcements so we'll see what happens
3152000	3154000	Loki
3154000	3156000	Alright so some other good news for the Xbox One
3156000	3158000	Platform
3158000	3160000	They are making available to all the developers
3160000	3162000	The Xbox Live Compute
3162000	3164000	I don't know if you would call it
3164000	3166000	I guess
3166000	3168000	SDK which is basically
3168000	3170000	The ability to use the cloud servers
3170000	3172000	For off platform
3172000	3174000	Computations
3174000	3176000	Including physics and
3176000	3178000	More importantly dedicated
3178000	3180000	Servers and so because
3180000	3182000	Of that dedicated servers
3182000	3184000	For all multiplayer games
3184000	3186000	Is possible
3186000	3188000	But it has to be enabled by
3188000	3190000	The developers
3190000	3192000	Because they can also choose to
3192000	3194000	Have control over that
3194000	3196000	Versus using the Xbox Live Compute
3196000	3198000	Stuff and
3198000	3200000	I guess they are saying that they have
3200000	3202000	Over 300,000
3202000	3204000	Virtual servers
3204000	3206000	Powered by cloud technology
3206000	3208000	So it sounds like
3208000	3210000	That they could get some
3210000	3212000	I mean that's definitely a plus for a lot of people
3212000	3214000	That play multiplayer especially like Call of Duty
3214000	3216000	And stuff that year and a half
3216000	3218000	Dedicated servers and also kind of
3218000	3220000	Curbs cheating a bit because there's
3220000	3222000	People that hack the platforms and stuff
3222000	3224000	And having a dedicated
3224000	3226000	Server would kind of eliminate that
3226000	3228000	Sounds ambitious
3228000	3230000	And entirely
3230000	3232000	A good idea
3232000	3234000	I'm just curious to see
3234000	3236000	Because they keep talking about these Azure cloud
3236000	3238000	Servers and stuff and
3238000	3240000	I'm just curious to see how
3240000	3242000	Stable that all is
3242000	3244000	Because every
3244000	3246000	Every company comes out and says
3246000	3248000	Hey yeah we've seen these
3248000	3250000	Problems with connectivity
3250000	3252000	And stuff like that
3252000	3254000	It's not going to happen to us
3254000	3256000	We're prepared this time
3256000	3258000	And every time it's fucked up
3258000	3260000	So you know I'm kind of
3260000	3262000	Curious to see how all these servers
3262000	3264000	Are going to play into that
3264000	3266000	Or if it's just going to be a big fucking mess
3266000	3268000	Because I wouldn't be surprised
3268000	3270000	If it was a big fucking mess
3270000	3272000	Just because all the other
3272000	3274000	Online games and stuff have just been
3274000	3276000	Messy
3276000	3278000	What will be the first Xbox game to get that
3278000	3280000	37 equivalent or the
3280000	3282000	SimCity connection error and all these
3282000	3284000	Hilarities in the past
3284000	3286000	The one that I could see would be the biggest
3286000	3288000	Pain in the ass would maybe be fours of
3288000	3290000	Five because remember you have to download
3290000	3292000	Part of the game
3292000	3294000	Or most of the game
3294000	3296000	Because it's not done yet on the disk
3296000	3298000	I can see that being a problem
3298000	3300000	If you can't connect to their cloud servers
3300000	3302000	Also the other thing
3302000	3304000	Remember just like
3304000	3306000	Rockstar just had the problem where it wasn't
3306000	3308000	Necessarily all of the cloud servers
3308000	3310000	But mainly the matchmaking stuff
3310000	3312000	Was down and so even if you have
3312000	3314000	A part of your
3314000	3316000	Service down that it could still affect
3316000	3318000	Everything so
3318000	3320000	I don't know
3320000	3322000	It'd be interesting to see
3322000	3324000	My thought is okay
3324000	3326000	If it's so easy for you
3326000	3328000	To do this as a company
3328000	3330000	Microsoft then why isn't anybody
3330000	3332000	Else doing it that way
3332000	3334000	If this is so easy
3334000	3336000	If it's such the right way to go
3336000	3338000	Then why don't we have
3338000	3340000	Rockstar hosting their stuff
3340000	3342000	And azure servers and all that stuff
3342000	3344000	It makes me think that there's a little bit
3344000	3346000	More hype to it than
3346000	3348000	It's actually gonna
3348000	3350000	Be reality so
3350000	3352000	I guess we'll have to see when it launches
3352000	3354000	I'm sure we'll be talking about stories
3354000	3356000	Of connectivity and
3356000	3358000	I'm not saying it's probably limited to
3358000	3360000	Microsoft at all
3360000	3362000	If the PlayStation 4 relies heavily on
3362000	3364000	Yeah it's probably gonna be everybody
3364000	3366000	Alright
3366000	3368000	Shifting gears here a little bit
3368000	3370000	If you are a PC gamer
3370000	3372000	By any means or even if you've just lightly played
3372000	3374000	PC games in the past I'm sure you're
3374000	3376000	Familiar with the game Myst
3376000	3378000	This is one of the top selling PC games
3378000	3380000	They ever made it's an adventure game
3380000	3382000	And they've remade this game a ton of times
3382000	3384000	There were a lot of games in the series
3384000	3386000	Riven was another big game
3386000	3388000	These were both games by Cyan
3388000	3390000	Inc. was the name of the studio that made these games
3390000	3392000	Well they have announced that they are
3392000	3394000	Making a new game it's called
3394000	3396000	Abduction not Abduction
3396000	3398000	It's O-B-D-U-C-T-I-O-N
3398000	3400000	Abduction is the new game
3400000	3402000	But here's the interesting thing
3402000	3404000	It is a Kickstarter game this is where they're
3404000	3406000	Taking their case to Kickstarter and they're trying to get
3406000	3408000	1.1 million dollars
3408000	3410000	To make this game work
3410000	3412000	They're talking about very similar
3412000	3414000	Exploration driven gameplay that help make
3414000	3416000	Myst a reality
3416000	3418000	They're gonna do Unreal Engine 4
3418000	3420000	Is what they want to be able to license
3420000	3422000	To make this game work
3422000	3424000	And they're targeting mid to late 2015
3424000	3426000	So they're giving themselves
3426000	3428000	Plenty of time to make Abduction
3428000	3430000	Happen
3430000	3432000	So if you want to check that out you can go to their Kickstarter
3432000	3434000	Now the thing that really got me about this
3434000	3436000	Though is I'm like dude this is the studio
3436000	3438000	That made Myst and Riven
3438000	3440000	Like why do they have to
3440000	3442000	Turn to Kickstarter? Like surely there's
3442000	3444000	A publisher or somebody out there that's willing
3444000	3446000	To back them a little bit
3446000	3448000	And I'm like well what the hell else have they done
3448000	3450000	Outside of Riven and Myst
3450000	3452000	Anybody know without cheating
3452000	3454000	What some of the other games Cyan Inc. did
3454000	3456000	In the down time
3456000	3458000	Cause once I went to go look at the list I was like
3458000	3460000	Oh yeah there was that game that really
3460000	3462000	Didn't do well
3462000	3464000	It was the one that was that Myst
3464000	3466000	Not Myst Online or whatever the hell they ended up calling it
3466000	3468000	That was part of, was it GameTap actually?
3468000	3470000	It was Myst Online Uru Live
3470000	3472000	And it didn't, you're right
3472000	3474000	That's it, it went over to GameTap
3474000	3476000	In the Uru games actually
3476000	3478000	Uru I think was the third Myst
3478000	3480000	And then they did all these different Uru games
3480000	3482000	That Ubisoft was doing for a while
3482000	3484000	Including Myst 5
3484000	3486000	Went all the way there and then Myst Online
3486000	3488000	Yeah I remember that game kind of flopped
3488000	3490000	And GameTap picked it up and ran it for a little while
3490000	3492000	I actually played Myst Online
3492000	3494000	The funny thing is back in 2007
3494000	3496000	This show was around and I think there's some
3496000	3498000	Old episodes where I was talking about my experiences
3498000	3500000	In Myst Online
3500000	3502000	It was just such an odd game
3502000	3504000	It was just like, it was so like
3504000	3506000	Just kind of creepy
3506000	3508000	Odd, like the ambience in that game
3508000	3510000	Was really, like
3510000	3512000	Chills, but I mean I enjoyed what I did
3512000	3514000	Play of it even though it wasn't
3514000	3516000	As obvious of a game
3516000	3518000	As World of Warcraft or even EverQuest
3518000	3520000	Where it's like, experience leads to
3520000	3522000	Levels, leads to abilities, leads to gold
3522000	3524000	Gold, gold, you know Uru Online
3524000	3526000	Was a very different type of game
3526000	3528000	Other than that, that was 2007
3528000	3530000	And since then it's been a lot of
3530000	3532000	iPhone, iPod, iPad
3532000	3534000	Type of stuff
3534000	3536000	They adapted Myst, they adapted Riven
3536000	3538000	They did some games called Bugchucker
3538000	3540000	And Stoneship
3540000	3542000	Abduction is a very
3542000	3544000	Kind of anxious
3544000	3546000	Return to form, shall we say
3546000	3548000	For this company
3548000	3550000	Best of luck to them, they just might do it
3550000	3552000	They got a 1.1 million dollar goal
3552000	3554000	They have raised just shy of
3554000	3556000	Half a million, they're at $460,000
3556000	3558000	With 26 days to go
3558000	3560000	So they've already made
3560000	3562000	Between a third and a half of the money
3562000	3564000	With only 4 days down
3564000	3566000	So that's pretty cool
3566000	3568000	$25 or more will get you the game
3568000	3570000	Via Kickstarter, by the way
3570000	3572000	$45 is a digital collection
3572000	3574000	Let's see some of the crazy
3574000	3576000	Rewards they're giving, let's see
3576000	3578000	$10,000 or more will give you
3578000	3580000	An experience design at
3580000	3582000	Cyan, you can actually go
3582000	3584000	To an early abduction design meeting
3584000	3586000	You can either go there
3586000	3588000	Or join via Skype
3588000	3590000	And I guess you get to have your say in the game
3590000	3592000	Kind of neat
3592000	3594000	So there you go
3594000	3596000	And they're already looking at stretch goals too
3596000	3598000	But they won't say what they are until they reach the base funding
3598000	3600000	Which I imagine would just be more
3600000	3602000	Expansions of the game and so on and so on
3602000	3604000	So
3604000	3606000	Going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com
3606000	3608000	SSJ100Matt says, Myst was odd
3608000	3610000	I should go back to it
3610000	3612000	I still have the original CD-ROM copy laying around
3612000	3614000	Reginator says
3614000	3616000	Riven original soundtrack is great to play
3616000	3618000	If you're having trouble sleeping
3618000	3620000	DungeonBuster says, Cyan went the way
3620000	3622000	That a lot of adventure games did in the 90s
3622000	3624000	Which is probably why they're kickstarting
3624000	3626000	This project
3626000	3628000	Tim Schafer had to kickstart his own adventure game
3628000	3630000	Just to get it going
3630000	3632000	Well it's so interesting because a lot of these projects
3632000	3634000	End up being very successful
3634000	3636000	So it's surprising to me
3636000	3638000	And especially with how well The Walking Dead did
3638000	3640000	Last year and was so well received
3640000	3642000	And everything, I'm like, I'm really surprised
3642000	3644000	That the mainstream is not getting
3644000	3646000	Like, dude, people never
3646000	3648000	Really got over the 90s adventure game
3648000	3650000	Thing, there's still very much an audience
3650000	3652000	For that, you know
3652000	3654000	Anyhow
3654000	3656000	Reginator says
3656000	3658000	SSJ100Matt is that even playable
3658000	3660000	On modern PC's
3660000	3662000	Well they had it in GameTap
3662000	3664000	Even though GameTap is a few years old at this point
3664000	3666000	You definitely could play all those games
3666000	3668000	I'm sure
3668000	3670000	It's gotta be on good old games, right?
3670000	3672000	It has to be there
3672000	3674000	Alright, there you go
3674000	3676000	Good luck to the studio getting that going
3676000	3678000	It'll be exciting if they get it done
3678000	3680000	I hope it's as creepy as other games
3680000	3682000	Dark Soccer
3682000	3684000	Well, Rob, this actually may affect you
3684000	3686000	May or may not affect you
3686000	3688000	And 50,000 other people that I know
3688000	3690000	Fucking play this game
3690000	3692000	Do I have to go get a shot?
3692000	3694000	No, no, no, but there is a bug
3694000	3696000	However, it's not a sickness bug
3696000	3698000	It's a sickness within Pokemon X and Y
3698000	3700000	So the entire game
3700000	3702000	Yeah, the whole game, no
3702000	3704000	Basically, if you save your game in Lumiose City
3704000	3710000	There is a problem where if you save in and around the streets
3710000	3712000	Outside the city
3712000	3714000	The game will lock up and make you have to reset your game
3714000	3716000	And when you reboot
3716000	3718000	The game will load the save and freeze again
3718000	3720000	Basically it loops and loops and loops
3720000	3722000	Now, Nintendo is aware of this
3722000	3726000	And they're working on making a patch for it
3726000	3728000	That will be downloaded
3728000	3730000	When they have it done
3730000	3732000	So at least they know about it
3732000	3734000	At least something is going to happen
3734000	3736000	It just hasn't happened quite yet
3736000	3738000	And they're saying
3738000	3740000	They've put out a map
3740000	3742000	It's only a Japanese one
3742000	3744000	Which I will go ahead and also
3744000	3746000	Link to the chat room assuming it loads
3746000	3750000	But for those of you who are affected by this
3750000	3754000	Sorry, start over and don't save in the town
3756000	3758000	To register participation for this week's episode
3758000	3760000	Of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com
3760000	3762000	Use the passphrase, rainbow
3770000	3772000	Yeah, I'm going to make a note of that
3772000	3774000	So I don't do that, but I do like how in the new
3774000	3776000	Pokemon games you can practically save anywhere
3776000	3778000	So that's pretty cool
3778000	3779000	Useful
3779000	3781000	Much useful, but it's better than trying to find a save point
3781000	3783000	And do it that way, that's for sure
3783000	3785000	Alright, let's travel around the world
3785000	3787000	And check out some release dates of some games coming out soon
3787000	3789000	That hopefully aren't broken
3789000	3791000	That have hopefully been quality tested
3791000	3793000	Which is, by the way, not to get all tangent-y
3793000	3795000	Or whatever, but that's the good thing
3795000	3797000	About those other games you were talking about earlier
3797000	3799000	Getting delayed, like things like
3799000	3801000	Drive Club and Watch Dogs
3801000	3803000	And everything is that, you know what
3803000	3805000	If they have to do that to QA the games
3805000	3807000	And make sure that they're going to be right
3807000	3809000	Then fine, delay them
3809000	3811000	We'll never remember that they were delayed
3811000	3813000	Wasn't Grand Theft Auto 5 delayed a bunch?
3813000	3815000	We all forgave them, we forgive them, right?
3815000	3817000	And it was worth it
3817000	3819000	That's right, it was worth it
3819000	3821000	So, you know what, I would rather the games get delayed
3821000	3823000	To test the QA
3823000	3825000	Now in this Pokemon, I don't know
3825000	3827000	Because you can save anywhere
3827000	3829000	I don't know if they would have found that
3829000	3831000	During QA testing or whatever
3831000	3833000	That would be a very tricky thing to find
3833000	3835000	It would be
3835000	3837000	I forgive them, but Nintendo's
3837000	3839000	Got to be able to patch these things faster
3839000	3841000	And more efficiently too, I think in some ways
3841000	3843000	You know what I mean?
3843000	3845000	Like you kind of expect on Xbox and Playstation
3845000	3847000	It's always going to patch right away if they have them
3847000	3849000	Nintendo can kind of be a pain in the butt
3849000	3851000	They haven't quite figured out this whole internet thing yet
3851000	3853000	Yeah, that's
3853000	3855000	And I think that's part of what's their worst nightmare
3855000	3857000	Right now with Wii U
3857000	3859000	I'm still convinced that plays into it
3859000	3861000	I mean, my friends have made good arguments
3861000	3863000	About to the contrary and about how
3863000	3865000	You know, there is DLC for like a
3865000	3867000	Now, they just started that a year ago
3867000	3869000	See, there's something about
3869000	3871000	All of that
3871000	3873000	And the fact that nothing ever showed up for Mass Effect 3
3873000	3875000	Nothing showed up for Injustice
3875000	3877000	And all that just kind of
3877000	3879000	Nothing showing up for Assassin's Creed 4
3879000	3881000	There's something really weird about that
3881000	3883000	I mean, granted Nintendo's doing it themselves now with Super Luigi
3883000	3885000	And all this other stuff, but
3885000	3887000	Are they doing it differently than it was done on 360?
3887000	3889000	I don't know, so
3889000	3891000	You know
3891000	3893000	I won't know, actually I don't think that has anything
3893000	3895000	I thought it might have been Uplay
3895000	3897000	Or something like that
3897000	3899000	They didn't support those extra
3899000	3901000	You know, services and stuff
3901000	3903000	That maybe that was the problem or something
3907000	3909000	Actually, that could be
3909000	3911000	Now that I think of it
3911000	3913000	If Uplay isn't supported
3913000	3915000	Then that's why Assassin's Creed didn't get the DLC
3915000	3917000	And EA
3917000	3919000	Uplay has a channel on Wii U though
3919000	3921000	Then I don't know
3921000	3923000	Maybe they changed something
3923000	3925000	I don't know, or maybe it's just
3925000	3927000	Nintendo or something, I don't know
3927000	3929000	Tangentrain, ChuChu, let's go to release dates
3929000	3931000	So this week we actually have quite a few things
3931000	3933000	Coming out, starting off with Naruto
3933000	3935000	Ship It In, Ultimate Ninja Storm 3
3935000	3937000	Full Burst, which is just a re-release of the game
3937000	3939000	With DLC, PS3, and 360
3939000	3941000	For that, Deus Ex Human Revolution
3941000	3943000	The Director's Cut
3943000	3945000	Coming out on PlayStation 3
3945000	3947000	Xbox 360, and debuting on
3947000	3949000	The Wii U
3949000	3951000	And of course those are re-released for
3951000	3953000	The other two platforms
3953000	3955000	Plankton's Robotic Revenge
3955000	3957000	PlayStation 3, Xbox 360

3959000	3961000	And DS
3961000	3963000	Hometown Story
3963000	3965000	If you're a fan of the Harvest Moon games
3965000	3967000	Sort of a spin-off of that
3967000	3969000	That's on 3DS this week
3969000	3971000	Lego Marvel Super Heroes
3971000	3973000	PlayStation 3, Xbox 360
3973000	3975000	Wii U
3975000	3977000	3DS
3977000	3979000	Vita and PC
3979000	3981000	The Sims 3
3981000	3983000	Into the Future
3983000	3985000	Getting, that's a new expansion
3985000	3987000	That's on PC of course
3987000	3989000	Um
3989000	3991000	Let's see
3991000	3993000	Also
3993000	3995000	Disney Infinity, some more of the
3995000	3997000	Packs are coming out, Toy Story
3997000	3999000	As well as the
3999000	4001000	Woody figure, and I believe next
4001000	4003000	Not next week, but the week after next
4003000	4005000	Is Jack Skellington
4005000	4007000	Where the hell is Nightmare Before Christmas? It's that time of year
4007000	4009000	Well, it's been a GameStop exclusive
4009000	4011000	For right now
4011000	4013000	It's exclusive on the figurine, and Woody I think
4013000	4015000	Is exclusive to Walmart or Target or Toys R Us
4015000	4017000	One of those
4017000	4019000	I got an exclusive finger for GameStop right here
4019000	4021000	Sorry to the employees
4021000	4023000	My anger is not with you
4023000	4025000	The front-end associates
4025000	4027000	If you want to get some
4027000	4029000	2K games that have been
4029000	4031000	Out before, there's some collections
4031000	4033000	Coming out, including the 2K Essentials collection
4033000	4035000	Which is, I believe
4035000	4037000	Bioshock
4037000	4039000	Borderlands
4039000	4041000	And I want to say
4041000	4043000	Oh, what the hell is the last game there?
4043000	4045000	XCOM
4045000	4047000	The first XCOM game
4047000	4049000	That was on 360, Enemy
4049000	4051000	Not really the first XCOM game
4051000	4053000	On 360
4053000	4055000	No, I said the first XCOM game on 360
4055000	4057000	Okay, okay
4057000	4059000	That's on PlayStation 3 and
4059000	4061000	Xbox 360
4061000	4063000	They also have another collection
4063000	4065000	The strategy
4065000	4067000	Collection, which is Civ 5
4067000	4069000	And XCOM, that's on PC
4069000	4071000	And then there's
4071000	4073000	Another one with
4073000	4075000	I don't remember, I'll get to that in just a second
4075000	4077000	Let's see, Rocksmith 2014 edition
4077000	4079000	Coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox
4079000	4081000	360 and PC
4081000	4083000	Of course, they also have a version without the
4083000	4085000	Little adapter in case you bought
4085000	4087000	The game before
4087000	4089000	And a version with a guitar
4089000	4091000	You need a guitar for that game
4091000	4093000	Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
4093000	4095000	3DS Wii and Xbox 360
4095000	4097000	And that's based on the new
4097000	4099000	Cartoon series on Nickelodeon
4099000	4101000	Just Dance Kids 2014
4101000	4103000	On Wii and Wii U
4103000	4105000	And Xbox 360
4105000	4107000	Oh God, there's a kids game this year too?
4107000	4109000	There's been a kids game for the last few years
4109000	4111000	I knew there was the one, I didn't know
4111000	4113000	There was four kids games last year
4113000	4115000	God, does it have that horrible
4115000	4117000	God, that joke
4117000	4119000	What does the fox say?
4119000	4121000	I don't know
4121000	4123000	That would be pretty funny
4123000	4125000	Oh my God, that song gets on my nerves so bad
4125000	4127000	I've finally, by the way, seen that
4127000	4129000	And I was sorry I saw that
4129000	4131000	They play it on the radio now and I'm like, okay
4131000	4133000	That was funny for a day, stop
4133000	4135000	I'm so glad I don't listen to the radio
4135000	4137000	It made me laugh the first time
4137000	4139000	And after that I was like, yay
4139000	4141000	My wife has told me, and I also saw this
4141000	4143000	But I actually haven't listened to this song yet
4143000	4145000	Well apparently it's a huge kids song
4145000	4147000	It's a kids thing, but what does the fox say?
4147000	4149000	I thought it was a stoner song
4149000	4151000	What does the bong say?
4151000	4153000	What about
4153000	4155000	What about that Chinese food song
4155000	4157000	Now that, I'm here for that
4157000	4159000	That song
4159000	4161000	Cracked my ass up, and the video
4161000	4163000	Is fantastic
4163000	4165000	I hated myself for finding it funny
4165000	4167000	I have not seen that song yet
4167000	4169000	The Chinese food, that's great
4169000	4171000	Just seeing that guy take the panda thing off
4171000	4173000	I'm like, is that dude
4173000	4175000	It's the little things too, the little
4175000	4177000	subtly, horribly racist things
4177000	4179000	In the video, like when they're talking
4179000	4181000	They're playing Monopoly, like he rhymes
4181000	4183000	Some freaking Chinese who have Monopoly
4183000	4185000	And then he moves the piece to Oriental Avenue
4185000	4187000	In the video
4187000	4189000	It's like they're going for every
4189000	4191000	It's like they're going for every fucking
4191000	4193000	Stereotype in the universe
4193000	4195000	I love its badness
4195000	4197000	But then again, Showgirls is my favorite movie
4197000	4199000	It's sort of like, I don't know if it's trying to be
4199000	4201000	Lisa Lampanelli style funny
4201000	4203000	You know, offensive on purpose
4203000	4205000	To make you think about it, or if
4205000	4207000	It's just really being stupid
4207000	4209000	Other things coming out this week
4209000	4211000	A little game called Batman Arkham Origins
4211000	4213000	That's coming out on Friday
4213000	4215000	That's this week? Yes, on Friday
4215000	4217000	For some reason
4217000	4219000	That's on Playstation 3, Xbox 360
4219000	4221000	Wii U, and PC
4221000	4223000	And of course they have the Blackgate version
4223000	4225000	Which is not quite Arkham Origins
4225000	4227000	But it's a little different
4227000	4229000	That's on 3DS and Vita
4229000	4231000	And then Wii Party U
4231000	4233000	For the Wii U
4233000	4235000	And, you know, this game was so
4235000	4237000	Great looking
4237000	4239000	That they also have to throw a remote in there
4239000	4241000	In a horizontal stand for your
4241000	4243000	What games are in Wii Party U? I know nothing about this game
4243000	4245000	It's crap
4245000	4247000	Okay, Wii Party was terrible, it's gonna be crap
4247000	4249000	In Soviet Russia, Wii Party U
4249000	4251000	Just what the name makes me think of
4251000	4253000	Some other random games coming out
4253000	4255000	Cradle of Egypt 2
4255000	4257000	Which is a puzzle game
4257000	4259000	And Girls Fashion Shoot
4259000	4261000	Which is a fashion simulator game
4261000	4263000	That's it
4263000	4265000	That would be everything
4265000	4267000	Although, I do have to say this week though
4267000	4269000	I believe it's also the DLC
4269000	4271000	For Saints Row 4
4271000	4273000	So there's some DLC coming out
4273000	4275000	For that, the Enter the Dominatrix
4275000	4277000	Stuff
4277000	4279000	Alright, now's the part of the show where you get to
4279000	4281000	Hear me horribly butcher Japanese
4281000	4283000	Release dates, yay
4283000	4285000	On the Playstation 3 in Japan on October 24th
4285000	4287000	BlazBlue, Chrono Fantasma
4287000	4289000	Comes out, as well as
4289000	4291000	GQ Powerful Pro
4291000	4293000	Yaku 2013
4293000	4295000	Which is that soccer? It's baseball
4295000	4297000	Baseball
4297000	4299000	I knew it was a sport of some sort
4299000	4301000	Also on the 24th on the Playstation 3
4301000	4303000	Sengoku Musou 2
4303000	4305000	With Moshuden and Empire's HD version
4305000	4307000	Tears to Tiara 2
4307000	4309000	Hau no Matsue
4309000	4311000	What is Tears to Tiara?
4311000	4313000	That sounds like somebody who cries a lot
4313000	4315000	And becomes queen
4315000	4317000	I don't know, but it looks like some type of
4317000	4319000	Roleplaying-esque game
4319000	4321000	I don't know what this is
4321000	4323000	This is like half the other things
4323000	4325000	I see come out
4325000	4327000	Let's see what else, there's Root Double Before Crime
4327000	4329000	After Days Extend Edition
4329000	4331000	Kazuko Kiyakutomugu Ito
4331000	4333000	In regular and limited edition
4333000	4335000	From Cyberfront this week
4335000	4337000	Which looks like
4337000	4339000	I'm looking at a screenshot from this game
4339000	4341000	And I'm sorry
4341000	4343000	But those breasts are too much
4343000	4345000	For that face
4345000	4347000	For that cute little chibi face
4347000	4349000	She's got these breasts
4349000	4351000	She would be tipping forward
4351000	4353000	However
4353000	4355000	I can say
4355000	4357000	I was quite young
4357000	4359000	And quite stacked
4359000	4361000	So it is possible
4361000	4363000	That's a bit much
4363000	4365000	I'm gonna put it this way
4365000	4367000	I've been a D since I was 13
4367000	4369000	You're blessed
4369000	4371000	Nothing wrong with that
4371000	4373000	Some girls too
4373000	4375000	So if they don't show the boy's face
4375000	4377000	Then it's a date rape game
4377000	4379000	I don't know about this
4379000	4381000	This is a little bit of an awkward picture
4381000	4383000	That's a
4383000	4385000	Fucking game
4385000	4387000	So the quotes South Park
4387000	4389000	Nice
4389000	4391000	Not okay
4391000	4393000	It's essentially a moe game
4393000	4395000	Which Alan just said in the chat
4395000	4397000	Yep
4397000	4399000	Going to the Xbox 360
4399000	4401000	This week in Japan
4401000	4403000	Zero, zilch
4403000	4405000	On the PlayStation 3 though
4405000	4407000	That same baseball game
4407000	4409000	GQO Powerful Pro Yakyuu 2013
4409000	4411000	That's a Konami one
4411000	4413000	An ongoing series too
4413000	4415000	On the Wii U this week in Japan
4415000	4417000	Sonic Lost World
4417000	4419000	Which I think came out here this week
4419000	4421000	Sonic Lost Meh
4421000	4423000	On the Nintendo 3DS
4423000	4425000	A bunch of Sonic stuff
4425000	4427000	Including the Sonic Lost World port over there
4427000	4429000	But also some little
4429000	4431000	Headphones and cute little stickers
4431000	4433000	And all that shit on the 3DS
4433000	4435000	And lastly the
4435000	4437000	PSP still getting a lot of stuff
4437000	4439000	Right now including that same
4439000	4441000	Baseball game from Konami
4441000	4443000	Diablok Lovers More
4443000	4445000	Blood
4445000	4447000	Yes that is the name of the game
4447000	4449000	Diablok Lovers More
4449000	4451000	Blood
4451000	4453000	And it does kind of look like
4453000	4455000	Oh god it looks like Twilight
4455000	4457000	As an anime video game
4457000	4459000	A ton of visual novel games
4459000	4461000	Nope
4461000	4463000	Nope to that one
4463000	4465000	Nope N-O-P-E
4465000	4467000	Alright Dar Sakura how about the UK
4467000	4469000	There's a few things
4469000	4471000	On the 21st which is already

4517000	4519000	It's a question We Party You
4519000	4521000	How about this
4521000	4523000	Nintendo maybe you put out
4523000	4525000	A game on your new platform
4525000	4527000	It doesn't have the fucking name of the system on it
4527000	4529000	Oh ok
4529000	4531000	I would be with you there but remember
4531000	4533000	Wii Sports biggest game ever
4533000	4535000	Ever
4535000	4537000	No no no I have no problem with Wii Sports
4537000	4539000	That's fine
4539000	4541000	I'm talking about
4541000	4543000	I mean the U at the end
4543000	4545000	Like do we really need new Super Mario Brothers U
4545000	4547000	Or you know
4547000	4549000	Anything
4549000	4551000	Kind of just what they do though
4551000	4553000	The only system that didn't really do that was the GameCube
4553000	4555000	I mean even with the Super Nintendo
4555000	4557000	It was super everything
4557000	4559000	Super Adventure Island and Super Star Wars
4559000	4561000	And Super you know
4561000	4563000	But they were so much better than their previous versions
4563000	4565000	I mean come on
4565000	4567000	There wasn't really anything that was super that wasn't awesome
4567000	4569000	That was a pretty super system
4569000	4571000	The 8 bit the 16 bit everything looked pretty super
4571000	4573000	Thank you actdeft in the chat room says
4573000	4575000	Blank 64 everything was blank 64
4575000	4577000	On the N64
4577000	4579000	Superman 64 Mario Kart 64
4579000	4581000	Mario 64
4581000	4583000	This is just what Nintendo does
4583000	4585000	They beat that name into you
4585000	4587000	Or remember when they used to do it subtly
4587000	4589000	And this is more third parties but
4589000	4591000	They would use it subtly on the DS
4591000	4593000	Where it would be like you know
4593000	4595000	Something dual souls or something
4595000	4597000	Dragon Spirit or
4597000	4599000	Even the third parties got into it like there was that Castlevania game
4599000	4601000	Right there was DS
4601000	4603000	That game made me cry
4603000	4605000	Cry because you didn't like it or?
4605000	4607000	It was just not good
4607000	4609000	Alright
4609000	4611000	Let's get to a couple more news stories
4611000	4613000	For you guys and then the classic game of the week
4613000	4615000	Heck yeah
4615000	4617000	And also I'm looking at our chat room
4617000	4619000	Live.vognetwork.com if you want to join us in our chat room
4619000	4621000	And lots of talk
4621000	4623000	actdeft says super all the things
4623000	4625000	It's like it's pumpkin
4625000	4627000	Or something right now
4627000	4629000	So there you go
4629000	4631000	Live.vognetwork.com
4631000	4633000	Let's get into some stories
4633000	4635000	Alright so let's talk a little bit about
4635000	4637000	Games with Gold
4637000	4639000	And this was something that I was
4639000	4641000	Kind of meh I mean it's only two games a month
4641000	4643000	And stuff and I know a lot of direct comparisons with
4643000	4645000	PlayStation Plus
4645000	4647000	Which by the way folks
4647000	4649000	If you haven't jumped on this yet
4649000	4651000	Shadow of the Colossus is available on PlayStation Plus
4651000	4653000	I need to jump on that
4653000	4655000	This is Ico
4655000	4657000	Yes Ico was last month
4657000	4659000	I think it's still available
4659000	4661000	They cycle them through every now and then
4661000	4663000	But Shadow of the Colossus is on there now
4663000	4665000	And also
4665000	4667000	The what was it
4667000	4669000	The poker game from Valve is on there now
4669000	4671000	Or no not Valve
4671000	4673000	Telltale Games
4673000	4675000	The poker at the inventory 2
4675000	4677000	The second one was
4677000	4679000	Oh yeah I played that this week too for a little bit
4679000	4681000	I suck at poker that's what I learned
4681000	4683000	Yeah so those are available
4683000	4685000	Anyways this month
4685000	4687000	Of course there was Halo 3
4687000	4689000	And then I forgot the other game
4689000	4691000	That was coming out but they say
4691000	4693000	Though they are going to continue on with the
4693000	4695000	Program originally it was only supposed to go
4695000	4697000	Through the launch of the Xbox One
4697000	4699000	But they figured out that hey
4699000	4701000	You know what people like values so
4701000	4703000	They are going to keep on doing two games a month
4703000	4705000	So far
4705000	4707000	A lot of the games I already had but
4707000	4709000	You know okay
4709000	4711000	Yeah I mean it's cool that they are giving these away
4711000	4713000	It's hard to complain about free stuff
4713000	4715000	I'm going to
4715000	4717000	It is a little hilarious that they are giving away Halo 3
4717000	4719000	For free I don't expect them to give away Halo 4
4719000	4721000	But I mean come on meet me halfway here
4721000	4723000	Like maybe ODST
4723000	4725000	Or yeah I mean
4725000	4727000	Halo Reach
4727000	4729000	Yeah or Anniversary Edition
4729000	4731000	Because you know the games that are coming out
4731000	4733000	Like the Shadow of the Colossus
4733000	4735000	I think that was about a year
4735000	4737000	Or two old
4737000	4739000	And I mean Saints Row the Third
4739000	4741000	About two years old and it was already on
4741000	4743000	On there or hell Hitman Absolution
4743000	4745000	To be fair that is a little bit fuzzy
4745000	4747000	Math for Shadow of the Colossus because it is a remake
4747000	4749000	Of a much older game
4749000	4751000	I understand but the release of the HD version was
4751000	4753000	I'm with you I'm with you fair enough
4753000	4755000	I would be I would love to see
4755000	4757000	Like some Playstation 1 games on there
4757000	4759000	Or you know like Final Fantasy
4759000	4761000	Yeah they kind of stopped doing the PS1 games didn't they
4761000	4763000	You know like Final Fantasy or something
4763000	4765000	They gave away Tactics at one point I think that was on PSP
4765000	4767000	Yeah I think they might have given away one of the older Final Fantasy games too
4767000	4769000	Or they all went on sale or something
4769000	4771000	So I don't know
4771000	4773000	Alright let's see Nvidia
4773000	4775000	Doing an update to what's called the Geforce
4775000	4777000	Experience this is that gameplay
4777000	4779000	Optimization software and I've never used
4779000	4781000	This because I have the AMD
4781000	4783000	Or some ATI
4783000	4785000	Yeah I got a pop up this morning saying that I needed
4785000	4787000	To update that and I'm like shit I didn't even
4787000	4789000	Know I had it so okay
4789000	4791000	But I bring this up because one of the things
4791000	4793000	They're going to be adding to this is that they're going to be able
4793000	4795000	You're going to be able to capture gameplay
4795000	4797000	If you have a 600 or a 700 series card
4797000	4799000	So you can edit and you can upload
4799000	4801000	And of course even more people now
4801000	4803000	Streaming their games on Twitch I mean this is becoming
4803000	4805000	A real huge thing which is
4805000	4807000	You know as somebody who really loves independent broadcasting
4807000	4809000	I mean I do kind of love it but at the same time
4809000	4811000	I'm like wow
4811000	4813000	It's going to be even more like competition
4813000	4815000	For watching
4815000	4817000	Like if everybody's streaming who's watching
4817000	4819000	So it's going to be very interesting but I do love that it makes it
4819000	4821000	Very easy at least
4821000	4823000	And let's see there's also what they call shadow mode
4823000	4825000	Which will follow your gameplay and it will
4825000	4827000	Save the last 10 to 20 minutes of action
4827000	4829000	In a temporary buffer on your hard drive
4829000	4831000	And if you hit a hotkey you can save
4831000	4833000	The buffered footage and that way
4833000	4835000	Your stuff doesn't pile up on the hard drive
4835000	4837000	There you go that's basically what we have on the next gen
4837000	4839000	Yeah what the next gen consoles are doing they're starting to catch
4839000	4841000	This up a little bit
4841000	4843000	But it's 10 to 20 minutes and not you know
4843000	4845000	I would imagine it's whatever you have available
4845000	4847000	On your drive too
4847000	4849000	So
4850000	4852000	Most likely
4852000	4854000	So there it is
4854000	4856000	Some folks are going to be checking that out
4856000	4858000	I'm pretty sure ATI is only a matter of time before they have a response
4858000	4860000	To this and their own thing
4860000	4862000	If they don't already
4862000	4864000	Exactly
4864000	4866000	I can't watch your channel because I'm streaming on my channel
4866000	4868000	Yeah
4868000	4870000	It's going to be that
4870000	4872000	Eventually there's not going to be anyone to view these channels
4872000	4874000	Because everyone's going to be streaming their games
4874000	4876000	And clogging the internet
4876000	4878000	And it's all one site too
4878000	4880000	Which is fascinating to me
4880000	4882000	I mean I know there's like Ustream and a couple others
4882000	4884000	But it's really fascinating to me that like one company
4884000	4886000	Has such a huge share of this
4886000	4888000	Clearly they must be using those
4888000	4890000	Microsoft cloud azure servers
4890000	4892000	Or something
4892000	4894000	Alright let's travel to a time
4894000	4896000	When gaming was a little more simple
4898000	4900000	If you wanted to see a hot new video game
4900000	4902000	You had to go over to your rich friend's house and watch
4902000	4904000	That's what you had to do
4904000	4906000	You had to sit on the couch and watch them play
4906000	4908000	Or if you wanted to see streaming
4908000	4910000	You had to do it through a VHS tape
4912000	4914000	If you wanted to see streaming you went to the lake
4914000	4916000	Alright
4916000	4918000	It is the classic game of the week
4918000	4920000	Every week Dark Sakura steps into the gaming vault
4920000	4922000	And finds a game that she thinks
4922000	4924000	Hey brat
4924000	4926000	Get off my lawn and play this game
4926000	4928000	Get off my lawn, get off twitch
4928000	4930000	Sit down, blow on this cartridge
4930000	4932000	And check this game out
4932000	4934000	Dark Sakura what is the classic game of the week
4934000	4936000	The classic game of the week is Adventures of Lolo
4936000	4938000	Which I think Dan suggested as a joke
4938000	4940000	But it actually was kind of fun
4940000	4942000	This game was great
4942000	4944000	It had good music
4944000	4946000	Why would you suggest it as a joke
4946000	4948000	I was just like pick something Dan
4948000	4950000	He's like I don't know Adventure Lolo
4950000	4952000	I'm like okay sure
4952000	4954000	Here's the music
4954000	4956000	Even Loki's head bobbing a little bit
4956000	4958000	I play this game
4958000	4960000	I know I used to love this game
4960000	4962000	It is a great game
4962000	4964000	Anyway in the Adventures of Lolo
4964000	4966000	Basically his sweetie Lala
4966000	4968000	Is captured by the villain
4968000	4970000	King Egger
4970000	4972000	So Lolo's like bitch you give me back my woman
4972000	4974000	And he watches right up to the castle
4974000	4976000	And kicks the door down
4976000	4978000	And says I'm not taking your shit
4978000	4980000	You know I don't seem to remember it going that way
4980000	4982000	That's my version so much
4982000	4984000	The Dark Sakura version
4984000	4986000	And then he sets the castle on fire
4986000	4988000	Yeah
4988000	4990000	And then he and Lolo
4990000	4992000	Make little round babies
4992000	4994000	Lala
4994000	4996000	Somehow Lolo became
4996000	4998000	Gay in your version
4998000	5000000	Would that be
5000000	5002000	Auto-gay
5002000	5004000	And that's how
5004000	5006000	Kirby was made
5010000	5012000	God
5012000	5014000	We're going to break
5014000	5016000	I'm done
5016000	5018000	So yeah you basically go through the stages
5018000	5020000	You get harder and harder
5020000	5022000	Every four rooms you get to go upwards
5022000	5024000	Closer to his victory
5024000	5026000	His sweet sweet victory
5026000	5028000	And if you get stuck on a stage
5028000	5030000	You have the option of dying
5030000	5032000	Which was great
5032000	5034000	God dammit death
5034000	5036000	So you commit suicide when you're done with life
5036000	5038000	SSG100Matt in our chatroom at live.vognitework.com
5038000	5040000	Says Lolo the game with its own suicide button
5040000	5042000	Exactly
5042000	5044000	So you can destroy the enemies
5044000	5046000	And shoot at them and you turn them into movable eggs
5046000	5048000	And when you shoot the egg
5048000	5050000	It disappears
5050000	5052000	Now the game was produced
5052000	5054000	I'm sorry developed by HAL Laboratory
5054000	5056000	And published by HAL America
5056000	5058000	For the NES
5058000	5060000	And it came out on April 20th
5060000	5062000	The day after my birthday
5062000	5064000	Remember it everybody and get me stuff
5064000	5066000	420 it's not hard to remember
5066000	5068000	In 1989
5068000	5070000	And it came out in Europe in February 1991
5070000	5072000	So they had to wait two whole years for Lolo
5072000	5074000	It is now out
5074000	5076000	On Wii's Virtual Console
5076000	5078000	As of June 8th, 2007
5078000	5080000	And August 6th, 2007 in the PAL regions
5080000	5082000	It is the only game
5082000	5084000	In the series not to have come out in Japan
5084000	5086000	However Lolo 2 and Lolo 3 did
5086000	5088000	It's just a fun little adventure game
5088000	5090000	It's cute
5090000	5092000	It gets kind of frustrating
5092000	5094000	Later on
5094000	5096000	But it's a fun game
5096000	5098000	And it's one that's pretty much held up
5098000	5100000	I played probably more of Lolo 2
5100000	5102000	Than the first one
5102000	5104000	Or the third one
5104000	5106000	Because by the third one it came out I was like I don't care
5106000	5108000	But I always had fun with it
5108000	5110000	I've always loved little
5110000	5112000	Spatial puzzle games like that
5112000	5114000	You know the little enemies running around
5114000	5116000	Well like your gaming week you've been playing Bejeweled and
5116000	5118000	Fractal it's a bunch of the same type of
5118000	5120000	Puzzle games
5120000	5122000	I fucking love Fractal
5122000	5124000	I wish it was 10 years later
5124000	5126000	So I could do Fractal
5126000	5128000	As my classic game
5128000	5130000	It's like instant fucking classic you have no idea
5130000	5132000	Going back to Lolo and Lala
5132000	5134000	It's a fun game
5134000	5136000	I mean basically
5136000	5138000	Like I said Lolo 2 and Lolo 3
5138000	5140000	Came out in 90 and 91 respectively
5140000	5142000	There's a Game Boy version that came out in 1994
5142000	5144000	That came out
5144000	5146000	With the same name Adventures of Lolo
5146000	5148000	In Japan it came out as Lolo no
5148000	5150000	No
5150000	5152000	Lolo no Daibouken
5152000	5154000	Lolo and Lala did appear
5154000	5156000	In Kirby's Dreamland Rob
5156000	5158000	And in Kirby Superstar
5158000	5160000	As Lolo and Lala
5160000	5162000	And in Kirby's Avalanche
5162000	5164000	As Lolo and Lala where they are antagonists
5164000	5166000	I thought it was funny
5166000	5168000	That you were making the Kirby joke earlier
5168000	5170000	But act deaf yeah I was bringing up that same thing in our chat room
5170000	5172000	And it was making me think as well
5172000	5174000	I was like well yeah both these games were made
5174000	5176000	Both Kirby and Lolo were HAL laboratories
5176000	5178000	And if you think about it too
5178000	5180000	I always thought that the little
5180000	5182000	Blue critter in
5182000	5184000	Guardian Legend was Lolo
5184000	5186000	Yes but it's
5186000	5188000	It's not
5188000	5190000	It's from that shooter game
5190000	5192000	Not Xanax
5192000	5194000	I keep thinking like Xanax
5194000	5196000	Is it Xanax?
5196000	5198000	Yeah I think it's Xanax
5198000	5200000	The little lunar lander
5200000	5202000	Yeah that's what I thought
5202000	5204000	But before I was familiar with Xanax
5204000	5206000	I often thought that it was
5208000	5210000	Lolo
5210000	5212000	I mean I guess having a blue puff ball
5212000	5214000	With legs you know
5214000	5216000	You can't get too uh
5216000	5218000	Too far away from that so
5218000	5220000	So anyway that's uh
5220000	5222000	According to act deaf they also appeared in the Kirby anime
5222000	5224000	So yay
5224000	5226000	So are you
5226000	5228000	Oh you're looking it up?
5228000	5230000	Well I'm trying to remember what that little thing was called
5230000	5232000	And somebody in the chat room
5232000	5234000	What is the name of the little blue fucker?
5234000	5236000	I don't know how to spell Xanax that's why
5236000	5238000	It's Z-A-M-A-C
5238000	5240000	That was the game
5240000	5242000	What was that little fucker called?
5242000	5244000	Yeah his name was little fucker
5244000	5246000	It was, that's Lolo and Lala's
5246000	5248000	True uh, that's Lolo's love child
5248000	5250000	They're twins I swear to god
5250000	5252000	But they're from different companies cause Xanax was an
5252000	5254000	FCI game
5254000	5256000	Or compile, it was compile
5256000	5258000	But FCI published it
5258000	5260000	Wasn't FCI like the publisher?
5260000	5262000	Or was compile, compile was the developer
5262000	5264000	Compile developed, FCI published
5264000	5266000	In North America
5266000	5268000	In Japan Xanax was published by
5268000	5270000	Pony Canyon, but you know what the segment is about
5270000	5272000	That's what Pony Canyon has done
5272000	5274000	PORN
5276000	5278000	At least they're not pink pineapple
5278000	5280000	You know
5280000	5282000	You were talking about the classic game of the week
5282000	5284000	Adventures of Lolo and now we're talking about
5284000	5286000	PORN
5286000	5288000	Only here at Orange Lones area
5288000	5290000	Well I'm sure somewhere there's a Lolo shaped vibrator or something
5290000	5292000	I don't know
5292000	5294000	This is after you made Lolo gay and set the castle on fire
5294000	5296000	No! Auto gay
5296000	5298000	Alright whatever
5298000	5300000	He is only, he's uh
5300000	5302000	Self sexual
5302000	5304000	Or would it be auto sexual?
5304000	5306000	Are you done?
5306000	5308000	I'm trying to think of what the politically correct term would be now
5308000	5310000	I think it's auto sexual
5310000	5312000	I'm gonna be thinking about this all during the break
5312000	5314000	I just love that it's to this music
5314000	5316000	PORN
5316000	5318000	PORN

5332000	5334000	The classic game of the week
5334000	5336000	I think it was Adventures of Lolo
5336000	5338000	But it might have been Xanac
5338000	5340000	So
5340000	5342000	It's always the guardian legend every episode
5342000	5344000	Alright that's it

5392000	5394000	of our show you know next week
5394000	5396000	that means it's episode 525
5396000	5398000	which might mean something
5398000	5400000	but cause it's a multiple of 25
5400000	5402000	and it's a palindrome
5402000	5404000	but I guess we don't really do anything to celebrate
5404000	5406000	I don't know what else to do
5406000	5408000	it would be the Halloween show
5408000	5410000	I would say we could do like a specially themed Halloween show
5410000	5412000	but we never have so why start now
5412000	5414000	I don't know
5414000	5416000	what would we do
5416000	5418000	sit here and play Silent Hill during the show
5418000	5420000	I don't know if that would be as effective
5420000	5422000	alright go to our channel
5422000	5424000	live.vognetwork.com some people
5424000	5426000	guessing the songs we were playing during the break

5430000	5432000	we played during break but tonight for the
5432000	5434000	live participants I promised some obscure
5434000	5436000	stuff cause I didn't want to just play like

5438000	5440000	you guys know but I did some
5440000	5442000	slightly obscure stuff tonight and for
5442000	5444000	those playing at home like if you're not in chat
5444000	5446000	but you are listening live you had Terranigma
5446000	5448000	started that off the middle
5448000	5450000	song nobody got that's because it was from
5450000	5452000	Cold Sept which was the
5452000	5454000	that was that card battle game meets Monopoly
5454000	5456000	I should have noticed that because you know I remember
5456000	5458000	you playing that game yeah I'm like the one guy
5458000	5460000	that liked that game and then the
5460000	5462000	third song that we played tonight was from
5462000	5464000	Intelligent Cube or IQ
5464000	5466000	remember that on the Playstation 1
5466000	5468000	there you go those are the songs we had there
5468000	5470000	and I was looking at the chatroom

5472000	5474000	air because you got he's the only one that
5474000	5476000	knew 2 of the 3 which is a pretty good score
5476000	5478000	I didn't see anybody else really shout things out there
5478000	5480000	let's see
5480000	5482000	also in the chatroom at live.vognetwork.com
5482000	5484000	before we get back into the news here
5484000	5486000	Akuma JP says I have a request
5486000	5488000	for Sky please do the
5488000	5490000	Cookie Monster voice and I'm like

5504000	5506000	I don't know porn porn porn

5508000	5510000	song the internet is for
5510000	5512000	porn like is he thinking of that one that's
5512000	5514000	not really Cookie Monster that's that's
5514000	5516000	the rip off Avenue Q style
5516000	5518000	thing I don't know I'm still mad I missed
5518000	5520000	that when it was in town I know you know
5520000	5522000	it'll come back you know what they have at our local
5522000	5524000	theater down in Folsom right now
5524000	5526000	they have
5526000	5528000	the stage production of
5528000	5530000	Evil Dead the Musical oh nice
5530000	5532000	with the splash zone with all the blood
5532000	5534000	I'm like dude that's awesome
5534000	5536000	yeah I've seen the shadow cast
5536000	5538000	troop here does that for Repo the genetic opera
5538000	5540000	with the movie that's pretty awesome
5540000	5542000	and then I was looking actually another
5542000	5544000	big stage show this time of year the Rocky Horror
5544000	5546000	show and that was also brought
5546000	5548000	up during the break is that Rageinator said
5548000	5550000	he found this game that has my
5550000	5552000	name written all over it it's the actual
5552000	5554000	Rocky Horror video game that they
5554000	5556000	made there was actually two I don't know if you guys know this
5556000	5558000	there were two Rocky Horror show games
5558000	5560000	neither were the picture show
5560000	5562000	I think they're both based on the play the first
5562000	5564000	one was like on the Commodore 64
5564000	5566000	and Apple 2e it was kind of like an adventure
5566000	5568000	game where you walk around and you're trying to find like the
5568000	5570000	transducer or something you can play as Brad or Janet
5570000	5572000	it's not good it's really not good
5572000	5574000	like there's a reason why most people
5574000	5576000	telltale games should do an adventure
5576000	5578000	game based on it wouldn't that be something
5578000	5580000	well in the 90s the late 90s
5580000	5582000	there was a revival of Rocky
5582000	5584000	Horror show
5584000	5586000	in London yes and they did
5586000	5588000	a CD-ROM game
5588000	5590000	inspired by the 80s classic
5590000	5592000	that went with that and it also
5592000	5594000	wasn't very good because it was inspired
5594000	5596000	by the 80s classic which in turn
5596000	5598000	that was not good the one with the blonde Frank
5598000	5600000	yes yeah yeah because
5600000	5602000	not everybody wants to look like Tim Curry necessarily
5602000	5604000	for the record before I
5604000	5606000	forget coming up in a couple of
5606000	5608000	weeks at my college
5608000	5610000	there's going to be another production of the Rocky Horror show
5610000	5612000	oh really it's a touring production
5612000	5614000	I'll get the info for you I sent you the hairspray
5614000	5616000	one this is the time if you're going to
5616000	5618000	time warp now's the time to do it I did also send you one
5618000	5620000	for hairspray I do remember seeing that
5620000	5622000	that's right I know how you love
5622000	5624000	John Waters things alright I do love John Waters
5624000	5626000	things but like let's be real they're never
5626000	5628000	going to do Pink Flamingos live unless it involves
5628000	5630000	unless it involves drag queens
5630000	5632000	which then anything goes
5632000	5634000	right maybe we can write to
5634000	5636000	Peaches Christ alright maybe
5636000	5638000	I'm sure I'm sure
5638000	5640000	she's done some John Waters movie
5640000	5642000	but anyway this is not a show
5642000	5644000	about John Waters films as badly
5644000	5646000	as I wish it was sometimes this
5646000	5648000	is a show about video games and we have some
5648000	5650000	rapid fire news to get to
5650000	5652000	sadly no John Waters movies being made into
5652000	5654000	video games but I think there's some other stuff
5654000	5656000	um so yeah there's
5656000	5658000	been some news regarding the Oculus
5658000	5660000	Rift um the consumer version
5660000	5662000	of the Oculus Rift
5662000	5664000	still no firm date on that
5664000	5666000	yet but it's supposed to be out sometime
5666000	5668000	next year um
5668000	5670000	one of the other things they're looking at is maybe in the future
5670000	5672000	also switching those displays
5672000	5674000	that are inside of it to 4K displays
5674000	5676000	so that would probably look pretty realistic
5676000	5678000	especially for some PC games
5678000	5680000	um so that's pretty exciting
5680000	5682000	um
5682000	5684000	anyways
5684000	5686000	there's a brand new game from one of the
5686000	5688000	um designers that used to
5688000	5690000	work at Harmonix and it's
5690000	5692000	kind of silly it's actually uh this
5692000	5694000	indie studio called No Goblin
5694000	5696000	and they have a game called
5696000	5698000	Roundabout and Roundabout's basically
5698000	5700000	this limo driving game where
5700000	5702000	you're a chauffeur of a limo and you have to get through
5702000	5704000	busy streets but the limo is always
5704000	5706000	spinning and so you have to
5706000	5708000	dodge traffic you do
5708000	5710000	run over a lot of people to like do different
5710000	5712000	things like you know deliver kittens
5712000	5714000	to orphans or you know
5714000	5716000	uh run over the orphans on the way
5716000	5718000	why does that why am I
5718000	5720000	reminded of that the kittens are safe
5720000	5722000	why am I reminded of that no breaks
5722000	5724000	valet game it's sort of the only
5724000	5726000	thing to play on the Ouya it's sort of like an evolution
5726000	5728000	yeah of that
5728000	5730000	or revolution if you will
5730000	5732000	uh it looks
5732000	5734000	it looks silly and um
5734000	5736000	I don't know I think that
5736000	5738000	yeah it's it's due out next
5738000	5740000	year um although they're taking
5740000	5742000	pre-orders for it right now at ten dollars
5742000	5744000	normally it's gonna be fifteen and that includes a digital
5744000	5746000	art book and soundtrack and
5746000	5748000	I guess it's like seventies themed as well it's set in
5748000	5750000	1977
5750000	5752000	um it looks funny
5752000	5754000	so yeah definitely check that
5754000	5756000	video if you haven't seen it yet and
5756000	5758000	uh last but not least there's a brand
5758000	5760000	new Minecraft mod and
5760000	5762000	it's involved or involving
5762000	5764000	quantum physics it's uh
5764000	5766000	called Qcraft
5766000	5768000	and allows I guess
5768000	5770000	players to do different things including like um
5770000	5772000	they have different blocks with quantum
5772000	5774000	entanglements um
5774000	5776000	I guess they're saying that uh
5776000	5778000	observer dependency characteristics
5778000	5780000	see this is all stuff that's
5780000	5782000	over my head um
5782000	5784000	cool
5784000	5786000	I don't really know what exactly that means since
5786000	5788000	I'm not really into quantum physics but uh
5788000	5790000	I like Minecraft
5790000	5792000	mods so let's let's dabble
5792000	5794000	with that
5794000	5796000	alright why not
5796000	5798000	Minecraft will be one of the
5798000	5800000	launch games on Playstation 4 right?
5800000	5802000	yeah that is kind of neat
5802000	5804000	so quantum physics in uh
5804000	5806000	Playstation 4 maybe?
5806000	5808000	alright let's go on to some other news stories
5808000	5810000	uh Pokémon X and Y I talked about earlier
5810000	5812000	in the show my first uh couple
5812000	5814000	couple hours in that world well some people
5814000	5816000	some people already beat the game
5816000	5818000	Shane if you're out there listening
5818000	5820000	and others I think ActDeft was saying he was on the
5820000	5822000	final four well there was a lot of
5822000	5824000	people there was a lot of people playing X and Y
5824000	5826000	over four million copies in
5826000	5828000	two days moved of Pokémon X and Y
5828000	5830000	Nintendo's going
5830000	5832000	bankrupt you guys the Wii U's gonna

5854000	5856000	well that's because White 2
5856000	5858000	and Black 2 were obvious cash-ins this

5930000	5932000	okay calm down
5932000	5934000	calm your tits calm
5934000	5936000	them alright soccer
5936000	5938000	is freaking out because we have
5938000	5940000	another story this is two weeks in a row now we're
5940000	5942000	talking about ColecoVision
5942000	5944000	because last week we
5944000	5946000	talked about that whole Kickstarter thing
5946000	5948000	and I kind of said my
5948000	5950000	honest piece that I don't think they're gonna make their funding
5950000	5952000	but you know I hope prove me
5952000	5954000	wrong please do I would not be sad
5954000	5956000	however we have something else this is different
5956000	5958000	this is a different retro device
5958000	5960000	that's gonna bring back the ColecoVision
5960000	5962000	it's a retro hardware company
5962000	5964000	called AtGames and they're
5964000	5966000	gonna be launching these devices that are based on the
5966000	5968000	ColecoVision they already make Atari
5968000	5970000	and Sega Genesis based handhelds so
5970000	5972000	I'm assuming these are those shitty
5972000	5974000	little plug and play things you
5974000	5976000	see just littering one of the aisles
5976000	5978000	at Target right so soon you're gonna have a
5978000	5980000	shitty little ColecoVision thing too
5980000	5982000	but you know it won't be shitty because it's ColecoVision
5982000	5984000	I love my ColecoVision Rob
5984000	5986000	uh so there's that
5986000	5988000	so that is coming I guess soon all we know
5988000	5990000	they've acquired the rights
5990000	5992000	that they've got the deal we just don't know
5992000	5994000	when we don't know how but you can
5994000	5996000	assume soon I
5996000	5998000	would think they're trying to get this on the shelves before the holiday
5998000	6000000	because you've got you know people in
6000000	6002000	their mid 30s like Darsakra and me
6002000	6004000	who remember this shit from when
6004000	6006000	we were kids and it would be a great
6006000	6008000	thing to find you know under
6008000	6010000	the Christmas tree or menorah or whatever
6010000	6012000	under the menorah yeah there's a
6012000	6014000	menorah on top of a ColecoVision isn't that where
6014000	6016000	you put the gifts
6016000	6018000	that's how it works right where else are
6018000	6020000	they supposed to go no no
6020000	6022000	you have the Hanukkah bush
6022000	6024000	the gelt goes in my belly
6024000	6026000	you know what though
6026000	6028000	it is kind of funny that Hanukkah
6028000	6030000	is the same week that Thanksgiving is
6030000	6032000	so I'm gonna make sweet potato pumpkin
6032000	6034000	latkes oh my god Hanukkah is that early this year
6034000	6036000	I know it's because
6036000	6038000	see they don't believe in solar calendars and
6038000	6040000	Judaism back in ancient
6040000	6042000	Israel we had the moon
6042000	6044000	stop complicating everything
6044000	6046000	you know what I didn't invent
6046000	6048000	I didn't invent the lunar calendar
6048000	6050000	these guys are just high maintenance that's what it really is
6050000	6052000	high maintenance
6052000	6054000	and I say that with love put the
6054000	6056000	angry emails down I tease because I love
6056000	6058000	I tell you what was absolutely hilarious was
6058000	6060000	when Christmas and Hanukkah were the same week
6060000	6062000	it was a nightmare in my house
6062000	6064000	because we were also moving
6064000	6066000	we had
6066000	6068000	blue stars and Christmas
6068000	6070000	presents everywhere so once in a while there's video game
6070000	6072000	talk on this show
6072000	6074000	Darsakra
6074000	6076000	oh yeah I got stories
6076000	6078000	well how about
6078000	6080000	a petition that is out
6080000	6082000	for the Grand Theft Auto 5 PC
6082000	6084000	version and it's at
6084000	6086000	change.org so you know it's an annoying piece of shit
6086000	6088000	however
6088000	6090000	you know what my problem with
6090000	6092000	change.org is all the damn emails
6092000	6094000	so anyway
6094000	6096000	they are over
6096000	6098000	600,000 supporters
6098000	6100000	to have a PC version released
6100000	6102000	and they have generated
6102000	6104000	as far as
6104000	6106000	the sales of the game goes
6106000	6108000	over a billion what was it in three days
6108000	6110000	so yeah it's made quite a bit of money
6110000	6112000	so there are also
6112000	6114000	sources in the industry saying that there should be a PC
6114000	6116000	version out early 2014
6116000	6118000	I was going to say
6118000	6120000	they're already making a PC version
6120000	6122000	they just haven't announced it yet because why would they cannibalize
6122000	6124000	the sales of the current versions
6124000	6126000	because people like to jump on bandwagon
6126000	6128000	especially if they know it's
6128000	6130000	going to happen
6130000	6132000	who doesn't like to come back and say
6132000	6134000	I was right
6134000	6136000	I totally called that
6136000	6138000	you guys I totally called that
6138000	6140000	how about all of us who said we totally called it without
6140000	6142000	signing a fucking petition
6142000	6144000	they're going to make Grand Theft Auto 6 you guys
6144000	6146000	I fucking called it here on OLR
6146000	6148000	also if you happen
6148000	6150000	to pre-order
6150000	6152000	Zelda A Link Between Worlds
6152000	6154000	you get a musical chest
6154000	6156000	it comes in a nice big box
6156000	6158000	now granted
6158000	6160000	this is
6160000	6162000	just for the US
6162000	6164000	this is buying the bundle version
6164000	6166000	the 3DS XL that comes with the game
6166000	6168000	it has
6168000	6170000	a golden Triforce cover
6170000	6172000	and A Link Between Worlds loaded on the console
6172000	6174000	and this was
6174000	6176000	already linked
6176000	6178000	from a
6178000	6180000	Gamestop Black Friday ad
6180000	6182000	so as far as
6182000	6184000	any type of European release
6184000	6186000	Game actually did confirm
6186000	6188000	that they're getting the
6188000	6190000	musical treasure chest as a pre-order bonus
6190000	6192000	so all of our friends
6192000	6194000	in the UK you're not screwed
6194000	6196000	this time
6196000	6198000	and
6198000	6200000	well
6200000	6202000	I don't know if I'm happy or sad Rob
6202000	6204000	because
6204000	6206000	well you're always happy to be in my presence
6206000	6208000	I know that
6208000	6210000	you know what
6210000	6212000	we have a little bit more news about the Mass Effect franchise
6212000	6214000	that will have a brand new story
6214000	6216000	completely unrelated to
6216000	6218000	The Shepherd or The Crew
6218000	6220000	or
6220000	6222000	any of them
6222000	6224000	so basically Bioware wants to take it in a new
6224000	6226000	direction
6226000	6228000	and they have said again
6228000	6230000	doesn't necessarily relate to The Shepherd
6230000	6232000	events whatsoever
6232000	6234000	but it has to be
6234000	6236000	Mass Effect Universe it's not just a spin-off
6236000	6238000	it has to be a part of the series
6238000	6240000	so
6240000	6242000	but they said something similar
6242000	6244000	6 months ago and we all
6244000	6246000	accept it then right?
6246000	6248000	yeah
6248000	6250000	I don't know how I feel because
6250000	6252000	you know I used to back in the day I used to want
6252000	6254000	a Mass Effect MMO I thought it would be
6254000	6256000	fantastic to play in that universe
6256000	6258000	to go around and hang out on the
6258000	6260000	different worlds and do stuff and maybe if it was something
6260000	6262000	kinda
6262000	6264000	kinda more like that
6264000	6266000	where it wasn't just all the human centric
6266000	6268000	bullshit that was you know Mass Effect 3
6268000	6270000	then I would be completely
6270000	6272000	okay with that but at this point
6272000	6274000	I don't necessarily trust what Bioware
6274000	6276000	is going to do so I'm probably
6276000	6278000	still gonna buy it because I'm a whore
6278000	6280000	sigh
6280000	6282000	I don't know
6282000	6284000	alright
6284000	6286000	I'm still looking forward to it
6286000	6288000	because you know it's Mass Effect and
6288000	6290000	it'll be great you know what I want
6290000	6292000	Turians the game
6292000	6294000	Queen Simeon is in our chatroom
6294000	6296000	at live.vognetwork.com and says still needs
6296000	6298000	Turians and Krogan
6298000	6300000	Alan Alchemy says it can't
6300000	6302000	be a sequel that takes place in the
6302000	6304000	same universe unless it's literally thousands
6304000	6306000	of years later because otherwise they'll have to
6306000	6308000	pick a canon ending between the red blue
6308000	6310000	green horse shit and that would be bad
6310000	6312000	well they did pick a canon ending
6312000	6314000	for part 2 didn't they
6314000	6316000	you wouldn't have had a 3 if they went with a bad ending
6316000	6318000	and 2 everyone dies
6318000	6320000	oh my god have you watched that
6320000	6322000	oh yeah it's great it's hilarious I mean it's sad
6322000	6324000	but it's hilarious the YouTube of the
6324000	6326000	Mass Effect 2 bad ending or whatever which is
6326000	6328000	the everybody dies ending OMG spoilers
6328000	6330000	for a 4 year old game
6330000	6332000	they have the shepherd the thing that makes
6332000	6334000	that video funny is they have like the ugliest shepherd
6334000	6336000	possible at least the one I saw
6336000	6338000	have you seen the the ones that
6338000	6340000	that have hacked it to give shepherd
6340000	6342000	garris a skeleton
6342000	6344000	yes that was creepy
6344000	6346000	there's another one that did that to give Jacob
6346000	6348000	garris a skeleton and they just got this huge mouth
6348000	6350000	it's so fucking weird

6376000	6378000	to be able to explore more options

6434000	6436000	inspired parodies like I don't know if you saw but
6436000	6438000	there's a clicking bad

6480000	6482000	on super mario brothers crossover and
6482000	6484000	happy wheels there used to be this really
6484000	6486000	fun flash game on disney.com based on
6486000	6488000	their version of tarzan many years ago
6488000	6490000	it was really fluid and fun to play I was a kid
6490000	6492000	but I'd still go back and play it now
6492000	6494000	uh our good buddy from koopa

6496000	6498000	are a few free to play games I've enjoyed over the years
6498000	6500000	but the best one being the kingdom
6500000	6502000	of loathing simple interface
6502000	6504000	much like clicking bad but totally
6504000	6506000	aloof and light hearted fantasy story
6506000	6508000	especially when you can be a
6508000	6510000	pasta mancer or a saucer roar
6510000	6512000	and it's been running for 10 years even I've
6512000	6514000	played the kingdom of loathing for a hot minute like I

6526000	6528000	slot games and table games in order to earn
6528000	6530000	points that can be spent on real
6530000	6532000	vegas rewards like a drink at the

6606000	6608000	I just wanna say this is gonna be so
6608000	6610000	hipster of me but I don't give a fuck

6612000	6614000	that game well yeah but you
6614000	6616000	like erasure for the record

6620000	6622000	album they just had one out
6622000	6624000	did it just come out I wonder if they're doing a new tour
6624000	6626000	that's what I wanted to see I'm pissed
6626000	6628000	off cause I had to say no to a pet shop boys concert
6628000	6630000	for free cause I had
6630000	6632000	fucking homework to do
6632000	6634000	worst day ever it was in
6634000	6636000	oakland and everything alright
6636000	6638000	critical myth says at one point
6638000	6640000	there was a sardicus clicky game on
6640000	6642000	facebook I was fairly addicted to
6642000	6644000	and I was playing a game called equilibrium
6644000	6646000	on my vita for weeks earlier
6646000	6648000	this year
6648000	6650000	raginator says to be honest I never
6650000	6652000	got into the free to play web game scene
6652000	6654000	wah wah
6654000	6656000	now I know
6656000	6658000	it's not exactly the same thing and this answer really
6658000	6660000	doesn't fit the question but the closest thing that sorts
6660000	6662000	of fits is pc gaming in general be it
6662000	6664000	on steam game for windows live or whatever
6664000	6666000	and the vod community already well knows
6666000	6668000	I've traditionally been a console gamer and a console
6668000	6670000	gaming fanboy since 1981
6670000	6672000	and for the longest time would have scoffed
6672000	6674000	the idea of pc gaming it wasn't
6674000	6676000	until the theft last year on my original laptop
6676000	6678000	my ps3 and tv that I
6678000	6680000	got into pc gaming albeit
6680000	6682000	begrudgingly if only because I couldn't afford to replace
6682000	6684000	my tv and ps3 now
6684000	6686000	I thoroughly enjoy pc gaming
6686000	6688000	well raginator go check out some of these links people
6688000	6690000	are leaving and you can fill up your pc with
6690000	6692000	crap
6692000	6694000	uh austin s says
6694000	6696000	oh and I'm sure we've all played this one being music game
6696000	6698000	fans we are ffr
6698000	6700000	flash flash revolution it was a web
6700000	6702000	based step mania game I used
6702000	6704000	to play it a lot back in the day but it's dated now
6704000	6706000	fair enough
6706000	6708000	alright let's go on to google plus
6708000	6710000	we have a couple answers there
6710000	6712000	actdeft says mostly facebook
6712000	6714000	games I used to play them a lot but I
6714000	6716000	eventually got tired of them like song pop or even
6716000	6718000	you don't know jack I do play the occasional
6718000	6720000	bejeweled bullets and tenders friends
6720000	6722000	and lastly
6722000	6724000	rettertainment says yes the sims on facebook
6724000	6726000	I never spent a cent on it and got
6726000	6728000	really far in it until I got a girlfriend
6728000	6730000	and started having sex in the game
6730000	6732000	then I got oddly disinterested
6732000	6734000	weird I also started playing
6734000	6736000	the sims freeplay on my ipad until I found
6736000	6738000	that I couldn't play it at work because I wasn't connected to the internet
6738000	6740000	that's stupid the game
6740000	6742000	is downloaded on my ipad and the file size is
6742000	6744000	mighty large why can't my save be
6744000	6746000	on the ipad as well
6746000	6748000	I guess because it's harder to take your money
6748000	6750000	if you're not connected to the internet
6750000	6752000	alright bye erasure
6752000	6754000	I'll miss you
6754000	6756000	you totally should use this every time
6756000	6758000	for the segment now I kind of want to
6758000	6760000	alright there it is our frugal
6760000	6762000	question of the week I'll quickly
6762000	6764000	ask are there any free to play games
6764000	6766000	maybe that weren't brought up that you've been getting into
6766000	6768000	lately or even in the past
6768000	6770000	cookie clicker is definitely mine they have
6770000	6772000	an iphone it's not official though
6772000	6774000	it's a follow up to horde house
6774000	6776000	the iphone one is cookie
6776000	6778000	clickers and it's a
6778000	6780000	knock off game it's still pretty good
6780000	6782000	but it's not official there is an official one
6782000	6784000	in the making just to say
6784000	6786000	I can't remember really
6786000	6788000	the last free one that I did
6788000	6790000	because remember
6790000	6792000	when I got my ikade
6792000	6794000	I kind of went on a purchasing spree
6794000	6796000	which I probably shouldn't have done
6796000	6798000	oops
6798000	6800000	yeah all the ones
6800000	6802000	that I actually still have on my phone
6802000	6804000	are
6804000	6806000	ones I paid for
6806000	6808000	I mean I'm actually looking at
6808000	6810000	my folder now
6810000	6812000	I have a robot
6812000	6814000	unicorn and I played for that
6814000	6816000	droplets I paid for that
6816000	6818000	yeah everything
6818000	6820000	on here I paid for
6820000	6822000	so no nothing free
6822000	6824000	Loki what about you
6824000	6826000	I don't think there's really been anything that I've played
6826000	6828000	for free aside from that time
6828000	6830000	when I was doing the whole ready
6830000	6832000	player one thing where I had to play that really shitty
6832000	6834000	garage sale
6834000	6836000	game on Facebook
6836000	6838000	oh god but I didn't necessarily
6838000	6840000	want to play that it was
6840000	6842000	did that guy really win that DeLorean or whatever
6842000	6844000	yeah he did there was a guy that won the DeLorean
6844000	6846000	because he got
6846000	6848000	the world record in Joust
6848000	6850000	I think of the 2600 wow
6850000	6852000	alright grats to him I guess
6852000	6854000	alright more
6854000	6856000	stories coming your way up now Loki
6856000	6858000	yeah no
6858000	6860000	no DeLorean for me that's right
6860000	6862000	it probably would have been more
6862000	6864000	you wouldn't have wanted to
6864000	6866000	pay the taxes on it
6866000	6868000	well the taxes and then on top of that
6868000	6870000	servicing the thing the only service center that
6870000	6872000	does DeLoreans
6872000	6874000	at least around here is in LA
6874000	6876000	so that wouldn't be very convenient
6876000	6878000	um okay
6878000	6880000	so let's talk a little bit about the PlayStation 4
6880000	6882000	hey you want to check out a PlayStation
6882000	6884000	4 well there's going to be some demo kiosks
6884000	6886000	coming soon to
6886000	6888000	Sony stores, GameStop, Target
6888000	6890000	Walmart and Best Buy
6890000	6892000	and uh
6892000	6894000	they have a website that you can actually go to
6894000	6896000	to see where they are at if
6896000	6898000	you go to it's the experience
6898000	6900000	playstation.com and
6900000	6902000	you put in your zip code and they'll show
6902000	6904000	you a map with all the different
6904000	6906000	stores that are
6906000	6908000	you know supplying it
6908000	6910000	and um
6910000	6912000	we have none there is absolutely
6912000	6914000	none in our area so I noticed
6914000	6916000	Best Buy is making a lot of room for both the
6916000	6918000	PlayStation 4 and the Xbox although on the whole
6918000	6920000	on the whole it seems like Best Buy
6920000	6922000	has really scaled back their gaming sections
6922000	6924000	I guess in
6924000	6926000	favor of other stuff and some of the things
6926000	6928000	we've been hearing about the company you know on
6928000	6930000	CNN or other new sites where the margins
6930000	6932000	are bigger cause gaming isn't it
6932000	6934000	that's for sure I guess so
6934000	6936000	so yeah and then
6936000	6938000	it's a little
6938000	6940000	I don't understand this
6940000	6942000	to be honest and this is basically
6942000	6944000	you can pre-order
6944000	6946000	digital downloads of
6946000	6948000	PlayStation 4 launch titles
6948000	6950000	look if you're willing to give them your
6950000	6952000	credit card they'll take it on the
6952000	6954000	PlayStation 3 and
6954000	6956000	guess what you get for doing that
6956000	6958000	no discount
6958000	6960000	so why the
6960000	6962000	fuck would you do that because you want
6962000	6964000	to be able to play that shit day one
6964000	6966000	even though if you're gonna have to
6966000	6968000	go and download it anyways so
6968000	6970000	go and pick up your PlayStation 4 somewhere unless
6970000	6972000	Amazon's bringing it to you let's put it this way
6972000	6974000	ok yeah I know that you can partially download
6974000	6976000	the game and then you can start playing it
6976000	6978000	once you've downloaded the game but
6978000	6980000	the thing is these
6980000	6982000	downloads are fucking huge remember we
6982000	6984000	mentioned on a couple shows back they had
6984000	6986000	this NBA Ultimate
6986000	6988000	Fan Pack or Super Fan Pack
6988000	6990000	or something like that it's basically digital versions of the
6990000	6992000	current gen and next gen versions of the game
6992000	6994000	the next gen versions of the game
6994000	6996000	were like 60 gigabytes to download
6996000	6998000	and I'm
6998000	7000000	sorry but there's
7000000	7002000	you want to do that just go to retail
7002000	7004000	and buy the game yeah you may have to pay taxes
7004000	7006000	on it but just go
7006000	7008000	buy it or hey here's a wonderful
7008000	7010000	idea maybe wait until Black Friday and see if they
7010000	7012000	discount that shit
7012000	7014000	might be something you know
7014000	7016000	I don't know there's just no reason
7016000	7018000	I can see the pre-order
7018000	7020000	a game unless you get something
7020000	7022000	I mean cause so far they haven't really said
7022000	7024000	anything it says I guess the only
7024000	7026000	game that you can pre-order that seems like you get
7026000	7028000	something for is
7028000	7030000	Warframe which is free
7030000	7032000	so I don't understand that at all
7032000	7034000	but it's free and I guess you get some
7034000	7036000	in-game money and exclusive weapon skin
7036000	7038000	so sure why not go pre-order that if you're
7038000	7040000	going to give it to PlayStation 4
7040000	7042000	in case you want to play it cause it's free so
7042000	7044000	but as far as
7044000	7046000	Nack you know
7046000	7048000	Killzone or something like that
7048000	7050000	unless there's charge I mean like
7050000	7052000	you know $53.99 or
7052000	7054000	some sort of discount there I just don't see
7054000	7056000	a reason to pre-order
7056000	7058000	anything for a
7058000	7060000	digital download I mean
7060000	7062000	fuck if you want to do a digital download
7062000	7064000	and you decide that you want to do that
7064000	7066000	do it at launch day make that decision on launch day
7066000	7068000	not necessarily
7068000	7070000	Well it just goes back to that old thing we were talking about
7070000	7072000	way back when the Xbox One was rumored to have
7072000	7074000	all these restrictions it's like what's the benefit
7074000	7076000	of going digital? It's not like they're not going to have
7076000	7078000	a digital copy for you it's not like
7078000	7080000	they're going to sell out a digital copy
7080000	7082000	of a game I mean
7082000	7084000	it just doesn't make any sense
7084000	7086000	Alright they just want
7086000	7088000	a really easy way for you to hit the button
7088000	7090000	and they can charge the card and give you
7090000	7092000	make another sale really easy
7092000	7094000	that's what this is all about nothing more
7094000	7096000	I think you're thinking too much about it
7096000	7098000	Logie
7098000	7100000	Alright well this game fell off
7100000	7102000	our radar years ago and
7102000	7104000	the last time we were talking about this video game
7104000	7106000	I think we were exclusively a show about
7106000	7108000	music based video games
7108000	7110000	this game was being developed for an arcade
7110000	7112000	release in 2005
7112000	7114000	I don't know if you guys remember when we were talking about
7114000	7116000	a game called Neon FM
7116000	7118000	remember this? Because it had
7118000	7120000	like freeze pop and it had some really other
7120000	7122000	like kind of questionably
7122000	7124000	good songs in it well it's been a
7124000	7126000	long time obviously and this game has kind of
7126000	7128000	reinvented itself a little bit because
7128000	7130000	Unit E is the
7130000	7132000	group now that's putting this arcade cabinet out
7132000	7134000	I think I heard a rumor once that at one point
7134000	7136000	Betson who ended up doing the DDR
7136000	7138000	cabinets years later was going to do this
7138000	7140000	game and they didn't so now Unit E
7140000	7142000	is doing this and it's no longer
7142000	7144000	a dance game that's the other big change
7144000	7146000	it is now a I guess
7146000	7148000	to me it would strike me more as like pop
7148000	7150000	music because it's got the big
7150000	7152000	circular pads that you hit
7152000	7154000	it was originally supposed to be played
7154000	7156000	the same way except the dance pad would look like
7156000	7158000	what that pad looks like right there
7158000	7160000	it was like 3 on the bottom 2 on the top it wasn't
7160000	7162000	like your typical DDR dance pad
7162000	7164000	it was like Beatmania with your feet
7164000	7166000	right
7166000	7168000	so yeah so Neon FM
7168000	7170000	is apparently now like a thing
7170000	7172000	there's a video out there you can
7172000	7174000	see it on YouTube and so forth
7174000	7176000	but is girls
7176000	7178000	butts in it and it is because I can see
7178000	7180000	that in the screenshot apparently it is
7180000	7182000	the song is so
7182000	7184000	awful that song is horrible
7184000	7186000	but I think by now it probably gets the joke
7186000	7188000	vote right no
7188000	7190000	it's still awful so apparently
7190000	7192000	it is still on target for release this
7192000	7194000	year to show up in arcades
7194000	7196000	that is if you still have an arcade near
7196000	7198000	you that contains games that don't shoot
7198000	7200000	out tickets I will say the cabinet
7200000	7202000	does look nice I hope this does show up in an arcade
7202000	7204000	you know what the best ticket game ever is
7204000	7206000	Giant Tetris
7206000	7208000	I would say either Spider Stomp or
7208000	7210000	Giant Tetris no the one where
7210000	7212000	you have those little like the balls that
7212000	7214000	you see in the McDonald's ball pit or whatever and you
7214000	7216000	throw them at the screen and break things on the monitor
7216000	7218000	ok that is pretty cool that one is a lot of fun too
7218000	7220000	because it involves breaking shit but I still love
7220000	7222000	Giant Tetris Giant Tetris is like a close
7222000	7224000	second yeah
7224000	7226000	but Neon FM no
7226000	7228000	word if Neon FM will shoot out tickets I don't
7228000	7230000	believe it does but that's all
7230000	7232000	they had to do if they wanted to make this game super popular
7232000	7234000	just put a little ticket dispenser in it
7234000	7236000	and the better you do on a song the more tickets you get
7236000	7238000	yeah well being that
7238000	7240000	based off step mania they could probably
7240000	7242000	do that or if you play that horrible girls butt
7242000	7244000	songs it will actually take your tickets
7244000	7246000	as like a penalty
7246000	7248000	no if you play the girls
7248000	7250000	butts then you get like
7250000	7252000	kicked in the crotch I would laugh
7252000	7254000	I would really laugh if they had
7254000	7256000	like a game like that where the
7256000	7258000	tickets would go in and out depending on how
7258000	7260000	well you did I guess it would get all
7260000	7262000	fucked up though because you know if
7262000	7264000	you tore it off
7264000	7266000	then it goes back in well they should be in like a
7266000	7268000	glass case that you can't get into
7268000	7270000	until the very end or it cuts it
7270000	7272000	or something like it should be like
7272000	7274000	look I'm going to give you all these no I'm not
7274000	7276000	I'm going to give you all these no I'm not have you ever
7276000	7278000	worked at an arcade of course
7278000	7280000	not I did
7280000	7282000	why would I subject myself to that bullshit
7282000	7284000	one of my two of my first jobs involved
7284000	7286000	arcade games and I know for a damn fact
7286000	7288000	someone would figure out how to get in there
7288000	7290000	my minimum wage job I already told you my minimum wage
7290000	7292000	job was I worked at a video store and we rented
7292000	7294000	porn and that was awesome
7294000	7296000	anyhow
7296000	7298000	alright
7298000	7300000	whatever dark sorrow
7300000	7302000	what do you have for us for the news I have some shit
7302000	7304000	no um
7304000	7306000	blizzard has once again
7306000	7308000	changed the name of
7308000	7310000	what was blizzard all stars
7310000	7312000	and is now heroes
7312000	7314000	of the storm
7314000	7316000	I don't know why the fuck they're calling it that
7316000	7318000	but yeah they even are quoted saying yep we
7318000	7320000	changed it again so
7320000	7322000	um basically
7322000	7324000	they've also said set aside whatever you
7324000	7326000	think you knew about blizzard all stars
7326000	7328000	and it's supposed to be um
7328000	7330000	more about it will be revealed at
7330000	7332000	Blizzcon November 8th and
7332000	7334000	9th and uh
7334000	7336000	there apparently is a trailer
7336000	7338000	online so look for it
7338000	7340000	I kind of
7340000	7342000	am like whatever although I have to
7342000	7344000	say that the picture on here of the
7344000	7346000	um whoever the
7346000	7348000	uh orc is
7348000	7350000	what am I saying orc uh
7350000	7352000	whatever the fuck they're called
7352000	7354000	god I played World of Warcraft for how long
7354000	7356000	that looks like an orc yeah
7356000	7358000	orc I'm just thinking ogre for some reason
7358000	7360000	oh no it's an orc no the orc just
7360000	7362000	looks absolutely hilarious so
7362000	7364000	it's got a little cartoony vibe to it I will say
7364000	7366000	though I actually think the new name is much better
7366000	7368000	Blizzard all stars is a little dinky dinky
7368000	7370000	yeah I mean I wonder if it's going to be
7370000	7372000	cutesy like that though it opens it up to a
7372000	7374000	bigger audience too because they're going to have to compete against
7374000	7376000	all these other mobas that are already out there but
7376000	7378000	you know I think um
7378000	7380000	it's going to be interesting because I think
7380000	7382000	uh the heroes of the storm
7382000	7384000	or whatever has the potential to draw
7384000	7386000	in a whole new audience to this
7386000	7388000	you know with their built in warcraft audience
7388000	7390000	and the people that are running the hearthstone and all this
7390000	7392000	I think it's going to be very interesting to see how
7392000	7394000	that plays out I might check it out I've just been
7394000	7396000	a little bit burned on all things
7396000	7398000	blizzard I finally uninstalled curse
7398000	7400000	did you? I did
7400000	7402000	reminds me of playstation all stars
7402000	7404000	well yeah but it's not going to play anything like that
7404000	7406000	it's going to be more like maybe that's why they changed the name
7406000	7408000	because it's going to be it's basically
7408000	7410000	league of legends which is ironic because
7410000	7412000	I would argue that it's not
7412000	7414000	final fantasy 14 or any of those games
7414000	7416000	that wow has lost its players
7416000	7418000	to it's to league of legends
7418000	7420000	I think wow's probably lost more players to league of legends
7420000	7422000	than anything else so
7422000	7424000	and sucking
7424000	7426000	it's interesting that they're going to
7426000	7428000	kind of have their own answer to league
7428000	7430000	of legends now so we'll see how it works
7430000	7432000	by the way can I ask you about something not to go on a horde house tangent
7432000	7434000	but I'd love to know what you think
7434000	7436000	what did you think about the uh
7436000	7438000	siege of orgrimmar ending
7438000	7440000	I like that it was different
7440000	7442000	if you were alliance or horde
7442000	7444000	but here's the thing
7444000	7446000	I hate to keep comparing it
7446000	7448000	but I can't help myself like times
7448000	7450000	have changed right like it's cool that you
7450000	7452000	get a two and a half minute cinematic or whatever
7452000	7454000	when you beat the game but over in final fantasy
7454000	7456000	14 like that ending was seriously like
7456000	7458000	15 minutes long and it was very satisfying
7458000	7460000	and it was just
7460000	7462000	I don't know like it kind of just made the warcraft
7462000	7464000	endings look a little bit like
7464000	7466000	oh that's all you get for
7466000	7468000	putting up with all the abuse you take in LFR
7468000	7470000	but as far as like you know
7470000	7472000	what went down story wise
7472000	7474000	I don't know it's kind of obvious
7474000	7476000	well I mean we knew he was going down but I was actually
7476000	7478000	a little bit surprised at who took over
7478000	7480000	I wasn't at all
7480000	7482000	but I was actually
7482000	7484000	a little bit more surprised with
7484000	7486000	Douchebag with Varian
7486000	7488000	so that was a little bit more what surprised me
7488000	7490000	well I was also a little bit surprised that Jaina was so bloodthirsty
7490000	7492000	in the ending too cause she's
7492000	7494000	they're really trying to make her the alliance
7494000	7496000	answer to Sylvanas
7496000	7498000	they were really trying to do that
7498000	7500000	it just doesn't suit the character I mean it didn't surprise me
7500000	7502000	given you know having your whole town blown up
7502000	7504000	but at the same time
7504000	7506000	it just seemed out of character for her
7506000	7508000	anyway too much wow
7508000	7510000	no no no I wanted to ask because
7510000	7512000	that's fair it's a video game
7512000	7514000	it is a video game we can talk about it
7514000	7516000	you don't like it email us
7516000	7518000	mailbag at orangesontrader.com stop talking about that stupid game
7518000	7520000	alright Loki
7520000	7522000	so Ubisoft
7522000	7524000	has adjusted
7524000	7526000	their financials and basically
7526000	7528000	have deemed Splinter Cell
7528000	7530000	Blacklist and Rayman Legends
7530000	7532000	under performers
7532000	7534000	and they said you know we've had games that were released
7534000	7536000	for which we anticipate
7536000	7538000	today lower sales than
7538000	7540000	we anticipated when we first gave our targets
7540000	7542000	and already released games
7542000	7544000	of course such as Splinter Cell
7544000	7546000	and Rayman and others
7546000	7548000	you know also
7548000	7550000	probably doesn't help too as we mentioned earlier
7550000	7552000	they delayed Watch Dogs and the crew
7552000	7554000	so
7554000	7556000	I don't know what could they have done
7556000	7558000	better
7558000	7560000	I just don't think there was a lot of interest
7560000	7562000	in Splinter Cell Blacklist like they thought
7562000	7564000	like everyone was kind of hyped up about it
7564000	7566000	I think at E3 and it was just kind of
7566000	7568000	eh you know
7568000	7570000	maybe because that's when the Grand Theft Auto
7570000	7572000	train started or Saints Row 4
7572000	7574000	coming out around the same time and stuff
7574000	7576000	I don't know
7576000	7578000	maybe it's just I know the reviews
7578000	7580000	weren't that fantastic for Blacklist
7580000	7582000	Rayman Legends looked good
7582000	7584000	but I guess a lot of people
7584000	7586000	you know it would have been a better February
7586000	7588000	title I think I think people saw right through
7588000	7590000	what they did with Rayman Legends I think
7590000	7592000	it's not that like pissing off the Nintendo
7592000	7594000	fanboys had that big an impact but I think
7594000	7596000	a lot of people saw right the people that would
7596000	7598000	tend to buy games on day one see
7598000	7600000	right through the fact that it was a Wii U
7600000	7602000	game that was backed into the parking
7602000	7604000	spot of a 360 place I understand that
7604000	7606000	but what about the difference in
7606000	7608000	you know had they released it just on Wii U
7608000	7610000	what their potential sales are
7610000	7612000	and even now like with the Wii U
7612000	7614000	coming out you know version coming out in September
7614000	7616000	versus February that's still a lot
7616000	7618000	more you know months in between there
7618000	7620000	and systems being sold that there's
7620000	7622000	potential buyers I mean they kind
7622000	7624000	of had to do that it was the logical way
7624000	7626000	to do it they should have released the Wii U game
7626000	7628000	the way they'd always planned and then they should have
7628000	7630000	released the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3
7630000	7632000	version later and called it
7632000	7634000	a gold edition or an enhanced
7634000	7636000	make it feel like an enhanced version
7636000	7638000	not a scaled back version
7638000	7640000	maybe or maybe just Nintendo
7640000	7642000	wasn't giving them any money to make it exclusive
7642000	7644000	and so you know there was no incentive
7644000	7646000	to do that maybe if they threw a little bit of
7646000	7648000	money their way then they could have had another
7648000	7650000	good exclusive title I don't think these games
7650000	7652000	are necessarily damned though because you know
7652000	7654000	it's gonna have staying power throughout the holidays
7654000	7656000	I think again I said the people who will
7656000	7658000	buy it on day one may be able to
7658000	7660000	see right through it but you're still gonna have it's a very
7660000	7662000	family accessible family friendly title
7662000	7664000	you know I think Rayman does very well
7664000	7666000	you know there's parents aren't
7666000	7668000	afraid to buy that for their younger kids so I
7668000	7670000	think that title can still tend to do well
7670000	7672000	throughout the holidays I don't know I gotta be honest
7672000	7674000	when I hear a story like this I think about
7674000	7676000	just a few months ago we heard that
7676000	7678000	Square Enix story about the guy getting up there
7678000	7680000	saying Tomb Raider underperformed
7680000	7682000	and we were all sitting here going are you high
7682000	7684000	Tomb Raider was like the best
7684000	7686000	that they've done in that series it's a very
7686000	7688000	long time it's a little different you know because with
7688000	7690000	like Splinter Cell that was the number four game
7690000	7692000	of the month in uh you know
7692000	7694000	August they're Madden Saints World 4
7694000	7696000	and Disney Infinity beating it out
7696000	7698000	um I mean
7698000	7700000	there's not a whole lot of other games
7700000	7702000	besides those
7702000	7704000	you know in the month
7704000	7706000	uh versus Tomb Raider which is like
7706000	7708000	one of the top selling games of the month
7708000	7710000	I think it was like one or two
7710000	7712000	you know cause Bioshock Infinite came out
7712000	7714000	that same month so
7714000	7716000	it's hard to tell I don't think
7716000	7718000	it outsold Bioshock Infinite but it was
7718000	7720000	definitely popular
7720000	7722000	um so I could
7722000	7724000	see the demand there for you know Tomb Raider
7724000	7726000	and stuff but I'm not seeing a lot of like people
7726000	7728000	saying oh I need copies of Splinter Cell because
7728000	7730000	it sold out you know it's just Tomb Raider
7730000	7732000	was like oh I need more Tomb Raider but
7732000	7734000	I don't
7734000	7736000	know we'll see maybe
7736000	7738000	they still have Rainbow Six
7738000	7740000	Patriots supposed to be coming
7740000	7742000	out at some point you know and um
7742000	7744000	I'm sure they'll
7744000	7746000	do well in the fourth quarter Satsuns Creed
7746000	7748000	is going to be a strong title for them and South Park
7748000	7750000	looks awesome so
7750000	7752000	they're not going to hurt too much oh
7752000	7754000	and Just Dance I mean that's definitely going to help
7754000	7756000	so they've got a pretty solid fourth
7756000	7758000	quarter
7758000	7760000	alright um moving on to
7760000	7762000	a story about a game
7762000	7764000	that is disappearing not because it underperformed
7764000	7766000	but because of license issues
7766000	7768000	Yoshi's Cookie I don't know if you
7768000	7770000	guys remember this game it was a game that was on the NES
7770000	7772000	it was actually what they don't
7772000	7774000	say in a lot of these articles about this story is that it
7774000	7776000	was also on the Super Nintendo because it's where I remember
7776000	7778000	playing it was it was on the Super Nintendo
7778000	7780000	but they released the Nintendo version of it
7780000	7782000	for the Virtual Console some
7782000	7784000	time ago Yoshi's Cookie
7784000	7786000	it got delisted this week it's
7786000	7788000	removed you will no longer be able to access it
7788000	7790000	on the Virtual Console it was pulled on
7790000	7792000	October 18th which bummer I
7792000	7794000	should have got it but the Super Nintendo version was better anyway
7794000	7796000	um
7796000	7798000	here's the thing about the game Yoshi's Cookie wasn't developed
7798000	7800000	by Nintendo it was developed by Bulletproof
7800000	7802000	Software Bulletproof made the
7802000	7804000	Tetris port for the Game Boy in 1989
7804000	7806000	which was you know huge
7806000	7808000	so that's why Nintendo you know trusted
7808000	7810000	them with the Yoshi stuff but
7810000	7812000	expired licenses being as
7812000	7814000	they are the game is no longer available
7814000	7816000	for sale
7816000	7818000	this is not the first game to be delisted
7818000	7820000	for similar reasons Konami's
7820000	7822000	Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles no longer available
7822000	7824000	Irem did a version of R-Type that was on
7824000	7826000	the Virtual Console no longer there the Donkey Kong
7826000	7828000	Country trilogy also no
7828000	7830000	longer there so
7830000	7832000	if you didn't get this game I
7832000	7834000	guess you'll have to go steal it from a ROM
7834000	7836000	or go find it at
7836000	7838000	Garage Sale good luck to you
7838000	7840000	I guess I could lend it to somebody
7840000	7842000	do you have the Super Nintendo version because I like the
7842000	7844000	Super Nintendo version I don't believe I do actually
7844000	7846000	I might have to check I mean at this
7846000	7848000	point I don't know what I have
7848000	7850000	after playing the Super Nintendo version the NES version
7850000	7852000	felt kind of gimped you know
7852000	7854000	as sometimes happens there were a few titles like
7854000	7856000	that that were on both platforms
7856000	7858000	but anyway
7858000	7860000	it's not like it was that good of a puzzler
7860000	7862000	it was just kind of fun it had a
7862000	7864000	good versus mode in it
7864000	7866000	alright it is that time of the week
7866000	7868000	where we go to the mailbag where you guys

7899000	7901000	um hey OLR since Mark Hamill has
7901000	7903000	retired from doing the Joker voice I wanted to
7903000	7905000	know what you thought of Troy Baker talking
7905000	7907000	I'm sorry taking over the role for the new Batman
7907000	7909000	Arkham game I had my doubts until
7909000	7911000	I heard a sample reading from
7911000	7913000	the killing joke that he gave
7913000	7915000	during the Arkham Origins panel
7915000	7917000	at New York Comic Con this guy is
7917000	7919000	super talented for sure I linked the
7919000	7921000	YouTube video if you have time to play it it's just
7921000	7923000	over a minute long and starts 2
7923000	7925000	minutes and 11 seconds in if
7925000	7927000	the link doesn't jump there right away what
7927000	7929000	do you all think? I've heard it's awesome
7929000	7931000	uh actually I remember
7931000	7933000	hearing about this but I didn't
7933000	7935000	hear the actual voice so
7935000	7937000	courtesy of Flaco Jones
7937000	7939000	memories
7939000	7941000	can be vile
7941000	7943000	perfect
7943000	7945000	repulsive little
7945000	7947000	brutes like children
7947000	7949000	I suppose
7949000	7951000	but
7951000	7953000	can we live without them
7953000	7955000	memories are what our reason
7955000	7957000	is based upon
7957000	7959000	if we can't face them we
7959000	7961000	deny reason itself
7961000	7963000	okay he gets a pass
7963000	7965000	that's good I like that
7965000	7967000	I've heard him do something else
7967000	7969000	and I'm trying to remember where I've heard that voice before
7969000	7971000	4 for you Troy Baker you go Troy Baker oh god he's a
7971000	7973000	hugely popular voice no I know but I'm trying
7973000	7975000	to remember um what
7975000	7977000	specifically I have recently
7979000	7981000	um well he was in Bioshock Infinite
7981000	7983000	which I haven't played
7983000	7985000	either
7985000	7987000	what would you have played that he
7987000	7989000	was in I'm trying to think
7989000	7991000	because he's done a ton of anime
7991000	7993000	hold on which I don't
7993000	7995000	really watch Fubbed Anime
7995000	7997000	Snow he was Snow in 13
7997000	7999000	Kid Icarus Uprising
7999000	8001000	you mentioned you played uh he's in that
8001000	8003000	um
8003000	8005000	Metal Gear Solid he's
8005000	8007000	Ocelot in 5
8007000	8009000	okay so he was Hawkeye
8009000	8011000	which I
8011000	8013000	have watched because of Jennifer
8013000	8015000	Hale oh and uh he's
8015000	8017000	James in Silent Hill 2 oh but only in the HD
8017000	8019000	version I think
8019000	8021000	oh then yeah which I didn't play
8021000	8023000	either oh well anyhow
8023000	8025000	moving on yeah well
8025000	8027000	oh no he was Robin
8027000	8029000	in Arkham City and Two-Face
8029000	8031000	so I knew he had been in another of
8031000	8033000	the games before Game Guru
8033000	8035000	in chat says wait that wasn't Mark Hamill
8035000	8037000	nope nope that was that was Troy Baker
8037000	8039000	good job yeah well I mean
8039000	8041000	I'd have to say that's pretty good if you know you can actually
8041000	8043000	get him confused with Mark Hamill
8043000	8045000	so um anyway
8045000	8047000	moving on um this
8047000	8049000	comes from um
8049000	8051000	Brian
8051000	8053000	and I did see Shane
8053000	8055000	say that he's sung with Akira Yamamoto's band
8055000	8057000	um okay
8057000	8059000	hi OLR I'm disappointed
8059000	8061000	with current gen Star Trek games
8061000	8063000	Star Trek Legacy was released on
8063000	8065000	360 N06 it took the franchise
8065000	8067000	seven more years to release a Star Trek game
8067000	8069000	overall the franchise has released
8069000	8071000	low quality games for current gen consoles
8071000	8073000	do you see a future for Star Trek games in the
8073000	8075000	next gen consoles thanks
8075000	8077000	um well Brian I don't think so
8077000	8079000	I mean
8079000	8081000	if they do anything it's gonna definitely be like
8081000	8083000	um a movie tie in I think
8083000	8085000	well the last movie tie in was pretty
8085000	8087000	terrible too that's the problem there's nothing
8087000	8089000	to make the games really
8089000	8091000	on right now unless
8091000	8093000	you know they go back and
8093000	8095000	do a new next generation game which would be
8095000	8097000	awesome uh they do
8097000	8099000	have the Star Trek next generation pinball table
8099000	8101000	in pinball arcade just random tangent
8101000	8103000	cause when I saw that I got giddy
8103000	8105000	um I will say this though so one thing
8105000	8107000	that email left out and I don't know if that's just because
8107000	8109000	this person is very console focused but
8109000	8111000	you neglected Star Trek online
8111000	8113000	which I don't think I mean it's free to play
8113000	8115000	it's worth a look I don't think it's bad
8115000	8117000	especially if you're a Star Trek fan I think it's worth checking out
8117000	8119000	and I have to say that they did actually retool
8119000	8121000	um that the skill system
8121000	8123000	that I kind of got pissed off when they changed it
8123000	8125000	the first time it's a lot more
8125000	8127000	manageable now um space battles
8127000	8129000	are still kind of you know you have to
8129000	8131000	ease into it from beginning to
8131000	8133000	admiral for you to finally get and they
8133000	8135000	got rid of rear admiral as a rank I'm just saying
8135000	8137000	but um
8137000	8139000	it was it was
8139000	8141000	Star Trek online was really good
8141000	8143000	I liked it I mean really all I did was ever
8143000	8145000	play it hang out at deep space night and play
8145000	8147000	Dabo Dabo with
8147000	8149000	Lina so
8149000	8151000	so there's that
8151000	8153000	I mean but unfortunately the reality is
8153000	8155000	without that stuff to tie into
8155000	8157000	and the fact that the video games unfortunately
8157000	8159000	have been tanking like it doesn't look
8159000	8161000	good which pains me because
8161000	8163000	I love me some Trek and I would love
8163000	8165000	to see like a really good video game
8165000	8167000	happen and it's kind of irritating that
8167000	8169000	that last one was such a stinker
8169000	8171000	actually going back to Star Trek online
8171000	8173000	I do suggest if this person has not played
8173000	8175000	it to do so because no matter which
8175000	8177000	era of Star Trek you liked
8177000	8179000	and yeah I really did not like Enterprise
8179000	8181000	but there are enough nods to the
8181000	8183000	even TOS characters show
8183000	8185000	up like you actually do a time
8185000	8187000	travel one and meet you know McCoy
8187000	8189000	and actually the model looks pretty
8189000	8191000	pretty much like he did
8191000	8193000	so I mean it's really really
8193000	8195000	fun I think
8195000	8197000	if you like Star Trek it's got enough nods that I think
8197000	8199000	it would keep you interested
8199000	8201000	nice
8201000	8203000	so um
8203000	8205000	back to the email
8205000	8207000	we have a kind of long one
8207000	8209000	but not terribly long so I'll read it
8209000	8211000	hello there OLR
8211000	8213000	hi
8213000	8215000	I always feel the need to say hi back I'm friendly
8215000	8217000	yeah you're friendly you're so
8217000	8219000	friendly um well last week
8219000	8221000	I had a very very unfortunate thing happen
8221000	8223000	to me when looking for alternative digital
8223000	8225000	distribution network now you
8225000	8227000	guys know I'm not big on DRM so I was really
8227000	8229000	happy that gamersgate.com
8229000	8231000	had a selection of DRM free titles
8231000	8233000	I bought a couple only to find out that the games
8233000	8235000	weren't all they seemed wait who is this
8235000	8237000	because they say we have to make some assumptions
8237000	8239000	about them in advance
8239000	8241000	ah I see okay
8241000	8243000	okay
8243000	8245000	um instead of giving
8245000	8247000	me a full installer I got very small files
8247000	8249000	that pull temporary files from the internet for installation
8249000	8251000	as I would find out after
8251000	8253000	perusing the site you're not able to get full
8253000	8255000	proper installers even if you keep the
8255000	8257000	temp files you can't install your game
8257000	8259000	without an internet connection needless to say
8259000	8261000	I was angry I shot off an email
8261000	8263000	to gamersgate asking for
8263000	8265000	remedy for this issue only be told point
8265000	8267000	blank there only called
8267000	8269000	them DRM free because there were no serial
8269000	8271000	numbers the person
8271000	8273000	who emailed me back even had the gall to say
8273000	8275000	that Steam and Origin weren't DRM
8275000	8277000	and that theirs was an industry standard
8277000	8279000	despite my never having seen something like
8279000	8281000	this before for the record the Steam versions
8281000	8283000	you do get the full games downloaded
8283000	8285000	so that is a point um
8285000	8287000	I demanded my money back but they
8287000	8289000	refused to budge so now I'm left sending you
8289000	8291000	an email and hoping to steer anyone else away
8291000	8293000	from there you know you do have the better business bureau
8293000	8295000	you can file an official complaint
8295000	8297000	especially if you feel like what you got wasn't
8297000	8299000	what was advertised I think you know you do
8299000	8301000	have a legit basis for complaint there
8301000	8303000	exactly especially since you
8303000	8305000	messaged them first to remedy
8305000	8307000	it cause you have to have taken that step
8307000	8309000	and I'm gonna be real this
8309000	8311000	is Orange Lounge Radio not
8311000	8313000	you know a TV network or something I mean
8313000	8315000	we're a small group
8315000	8317000	here we love our audience we love the
8317000	8319000	small following that we have but
8319000	8321000	this wouldn't really make waves
8321000	8323000	the way that I think you
8323000	8325000	you really want this company to
8325000	8327000	own up to what they're selling
8327000	8329000	well just but I appreciate
8329000	8331000	the heads up nonetheless seriously
8331000	8333000	I don't care what your attitude is towards DRM
8333000	8335000	it's unacceptable for a company to say that
8335000	8337000	something is DRM free when it really isn't
8337000	8339000	it's the most
8339000	8341000	disgusting dishonest thing I have ever experienced
8341000	8343000	and I wholeheartedly recommend people stay the hell away
8343000	8345000	from gamersgate.com after all
8345000	8347000	if they're lying about this what else are they lying about
8347000	8349000	however this is not a tale
8349000	8351000	of total loss I emailed Robert Boyd
8351000	8353000	of Zeboid Games and told him what happened
8353000	8355000	he immediately sent me
8355000	8357000	a desperate copy of the game that I had
8357000	8359000	bought and they were actually DRM free
8359000	8361000	moral of the story avoid gamersgate
8361000	8363000	and thumbs up to Zeboid
8363000	8365000	still waiting on response from Valusoft though
8365000	8367000	well that's my story hope I've steered a few people away from
8367000	8369000	gamersgate if I've helped someone the money I lost
8369000	8371000	was worth it sincerely we're all still UT
8371000	8373000	kinda interesting way he went about
8373000	8375000	the second half of that email where he says
8375000	8377000	I emailed the people that made the game
8377000	8379000	and said did you know this
8379000	8381000	but what's interesting to me is that he kind of breezed
8381000	8383000	by the fact that he got the Desura code
8383000	8385000	so why not is Desura
8385000	8387000	now your option of choice because
8387000	8389000	I know a lot of people are using Desura as a Steam alternative
8389000	8391000	and even I've used it because
8391000	8393000	one of our listeners was kind enough to give me a game
8393000	8395000	but it was on Desura so I've used it and it's fine
8395000	8397000	so is that
8397000	8399000	is Desura like your happy
8399000	8401000	alternative now that you've found
8401000	8403000	I don't know if I really heard that part of it
8403000	8405000	but I will say this in the email
8405000	8407000	in our chat room live.vognetware.com
8407000	8409000	actdef says
8409000	8411000	gamersgate is a mess of a site
8411000	8413000	I try not to buy from them
8413000	8415000	I've never heard of this site I have no opinion
8415000	8417000	I can only go off what the listeners say
8417000	8419000	and Rama says to file a
8419000	8421000	chargeback on your credit card
8421000	8423000	usually you want to do that as a last
8423000	8425000	resort because that can come back to bite you
8425000	8427000	I would say better business bureau first
8427000	8429000	and I do believe if I've
8429000	8431000	heard right if you've done a chargeback
8431000	8433000	then the company themselves may actually file
8433000	8435000	with a collection
8435000	8437000	which shows up on your credit report
8437000	8439000	you've got to be careful with that stuff
8439000	8441000	but no I'd say
8441000	8443000	you don't want to burn your chargebacks because obviously the bank
8443000	8445000	is going to take issue if you keep doing it
8445000	8447000	I wouldn't want to burn it on something like this
8447000	8449000	like use a chargeback when you really want to
8449000	8451000	fuck somebody over
8451000	8453000	my suggestion is
8453000	8455000	have copies of all of the emails you've sent
8455000	8457000	plus the responses dated
8457000	8459000	make sure they're date stamped
8459000	8461000	and use those with your filing
8461000	8463000	to the better business bureau you know I got a free hamburger doing that
8463000	8465000	once
8465000	8467000	I got a free meal
8467000	8469000	from this place and they didn't give you fries the
8469000	8471000	cheap bastards no no no I got a sweet potato
8471000	8473000	fries I got a whole meal nice and
8473000	8475000	they actually we actually
8475000	8477000	got to see them make the meal
8477000	8479000	a free voucher for a meal for two
8479000	8481000	because I complained about
8481000	8483000	the strata place that's on
8483000	8485000	Watt Avenue I used to work
8485000	8487000	next door to them so oh I don't even know
8487000	8489000	it's attached to like a Days Inn or something
8489000	8491000	but oh but it's a nice
8491000	8493000	restaurant attached to a crappy hotel
8493000	8495000	but anyway yeah I
8495000	8497000	can say for a fact that I've actually gotten something
8497000	8499000	out of filing better business bureau complaints so
8499000	8501000	and it was a pretty damn good hamburger too
8501000	8503000	that
8503000	8505000	is a tasty burger maybe
8505000	8507000	Gamers Gate will send you a hamburger
8507000	8509000	well we'll
8509000	8511000	cross our fingers and our toes
8511000	8513000	and then share with us okay
8513000	8515000	last email
8515000	8517000	okay hi OLR it's
8517000	8519000	Reginator again
8519000	8521000	I just had a question about computer
8521000	8523000	OS's currently I'm on my laptop
8523000	8525000	I have no currently on my laptop
8525000	8527000	I have Windows 7 home premium installed
8527000	8529000	which overall I'm happy with now the
8529000	8531000	trouble is I am a supporter of Zune
8531000	8533000	Xbox video in order for me to continue
8533000	8535000	buying content for it either I
8535000	8537000	have to replace my 360 that I sold
8537000	8539000	off two years ago or upgrade to
8539000	8541000	Windows 8 now the question is
8541000	8543000	is it possible to finagle things so I can keep
8543000	8545000	Windows 7 and use Windows 8
8545000	8547000	I don't know like put Windows 8 on a USB
8547000	8549000	drive or something how would I do
8549000	8551000	that I never once did anything on a
8551000	8553000	computer regarding an OS and I hate to either
8553000	8555000	brick my PC lose Windows 7 etc.
8555000	8557000	thanks in advance
8557000	8559000	I will tell you this that Windows OS
8559000	8561000	in both cases are very
8561000	8563000	well
8563000	8565000	extraneous with the other stuff that they
8565000	8567000	install with it so you'd probably
8567000	8569000	depending on how big your hard drive is you could
8569000	8571000	probably partition
8571000	8573000	yeah that's probably going to have to be the way you do it
8573000	8575000	because you can dual boot your system
8575000	8577000	but I don't know why you'd really
8577000	8579000	want to do that if you want to go to Windows 8 then just go
8579000	8581000	to Windows 8 you know if you need to see
8581000	8583000	the new movies which I think is kind of a dick move
8583000	8585000	on Microsoft's part I don't want to go to Windows
8585000	8587000	8 but I know that when I rebuild my computer
8587000	8589000	I'm basically going to put Windows 7 on it no matter
8589000	8591000	what it comes with
8591000	8593000	well don't forget 8.1 is out now
8593000	8595000	I haven't used that myself
8595000	8597000	there's stuff that make it like a lot more usable
8597000	8599000	like you know so it's more like 7
8599000	8601000	and Windows 8 overall is
8601000	8603000	more stable than Windows 7
8603000	8605000	it's just all the crap that they throw in the
8605000	8607000	front there that you have to dig through
8607000	8609000	and stuff's kind of moved around
8609000	8611000	see at this point I'm ready just to go back to
8611000	8613000	Linux Mint and Runwine for
8613000	8615000	my other programs
8615000	8617000	I mean they've now got most
8617000	8619000	of the game drivers and everything
8619000	8621000	compatible with Linux
8621000	8623000	comments from our chat room at live.vognetware.com
8623000	8625000	Rama says you don't need to upgrade to 8
8625000	8627000	SG100Matt says dual boot if you want
8627000	8629000	but there's no need for 8
8629000	8631000	Brad from Pod Culture says just go to 8
8631000	8633000	it runs everything from 7 just fine
8633000	8635000	and then Bobby Blackwolf says this is a
8635000	8637000	tech support question not a podcast email
8637000	8639000	question well I'm wondering because
8639000	8641000	he said the USB boot thing I'm wondering if he didn't
8641000	8643000	think of that because we were talking about it with
8643000	8645000	Linux a couple weeks ago
8645000	8647000	I don't know though that Windows 8 will
8647000	8649000	live boot you can't do a Windows boot like that
8649000	8651000	I'm pretty sure yeah
8651000	8653000	although I have done a
8653000	8655000	USB installer for
8655000	8657000	Windows for
8657000	8659000	fuck what that was
8659000	8661000	a netbook
8661000	8663000	I have made an installer
8663000	8665000	so I don't know
8665000	8667000	is that it for emails? yeah that's it

8731000	8733000	if somebody is listening to the show and you love
8733000	8735000	the sound of my voice just keep in mind that I can
8735000	8737000	also transfer the
8737000	8739000	sexyness to web design
8739000	8741000	and print design and fantastic customer service
8741000	8743000	and amazing customer service I love

8785000	8787000	uncivil
8787000	8789000	she's got great attendance she's shown up to
8789000	8791000	most of these shows

8821000	8823000	within the time that I order
8823000	8825000	in the drive through and pull up to the window
8825000	8827000	it should not take 30 fucking minutes
8827000	8829000	to cook wings
8829000	8831000	I'm sorry I mean it's like
8831000	8833000	you don't fry wings for 30 minutes
8833000	8835000	oh
8835000	8837000	and their fries fucking suck they're
8837000	8839000	soggy stale
8839000	8841000	unsalted it was just like some
8841000	8843000	of a crap potato into
8843000	8845000	a little
8845000	8847000	cardboard tray and try to pass it off
8847000	8849000	as french fries it was just not
8849000	8853000	good
8853000	8855000	here we go the food show again
8855000	8857000	orange lounge foodie
8857000	8859000	Nelly wanted to try Wingstop even though
8859000	8861000	I've been there and said listen it sucks
8861000	8863000	you know we shouldn't go back
8863000	8865000	take her to Hooters next time although I did get to try
8865000	8867000	for the first time actually going inside and doing one of those
8867000	8869000	coke freestyle machines and that was pretty
8869000	8871000	those are pretty awesome
8871000	8873000	she says we should go in these for our home I'm like
8873000	8875000	yes we should
8875000	8877000	that's a project you should work on building your own
8877000	8879000	oh yeah that'd be expensive
8879000	8881000	you could dispense the taurani syrup
8881000	8883000	think about it
8883000	8885000	I'm gonna give an FU to iMessage
8885000	8887000	because we all know
8887000	8889000	they're already having some type of bug
8889000	8891000	and I've been trying to text message during the show
8891000	8893000	and I think iMessage just stopped working
8893000	8895000	and I don't know what the hell is going on
8895000	8897000	but then one of my other friends sent me a text and I got it fine
8897000	8899000	so I'm afraid I can't let you
8899000	8901000	iMessage is my FU of the week
8901000	8903000	and yes I'm an
8903000	8905000	apple sheep and I have an iPhone
8905000	8907000	I just want to text message people okay
8907000	8909000	you can't text message breakup
8909000	8911000	during the show? what?
8911000	8913000	did you just
8913000	8915000	quote a Kelly song over there? I did
8915000	8917000	alright
8917000	8919000	just a couple more stories and then Twitter topics
8919000	8921000	and the Skype line at 1877
8921000	8923000	game OLR
8923000	8925000	first Loki
8925000	8927000	alright so there's a new
8927000	8929000	Kickstarter for a new
8929000	8931000	augmented reality glass
8931000	8933000	thing it's done by some
8933000	8935000	ex-Valve employees
8935000	8937000	I guess they've reached
8937000	8939000	their goal already but they're doing their stretch goals
8939000	8941000	what's kind of unique about it is
8941000	8943000	it's these shutter glasses
8943000	8945000	and they actually have projectors
8945000	8947000	so it projects 3D
8947000	8949000	images onto
8949000	8951000	the environment
8951000	8953000	the other thing though that seemed kind of weird though
8953000	8955000	is like
8955000	8957000	in the video and stuff
8957000	8959000	it just didn't seem like
8959000	8961000	I mean if you're moving your head and stuff
8961000	8963000	the projection kind of change where it's at
8963000	8965000	unless it's updating really fast
8965000	8967000	I don't know
8967000	8969000	I don't know, interesting, don't know what the price point though
8969000	8971000	of it is
8971000	8973000	certainly I'm not going to back it because
8973000	8975000	I don't need to spend money on this kind of crap
8975000	8977000	but you kind of want to
8977000	8979000	no because it's not expected
8979000	8981000	to come out for like a year
8981000	8983000	you know a starter package is
8983000	8985000	$189
8985000	8987000	and you get a cast AR
8987000	8989000	oh that's the weird thing about it is you have to have this like
8989000	8991000	actually cast onto it's like a
8991000	8993000	looks like a fabric
8993000	8995000	thing almost like a green screen but it's
8995000	8997000	grey so
8997000	8999000	it seems like a lot of
8999000	9001000	hassle but hey
9001000	9003000	maybe if it's cheaper then
9003000	9005000	I don't know
9005000	9007000	the Oculus Rift it might be
9007000	9009000	I think the Rift sounds more interesting because
9009000	9011000	it's VR whereas this is augmented reality
9011000	9013000	stuff and just I don't really
9013000	9015000	care about AR stuff I remember
9015000	9017000	trying to pull that shit off with the Vita and
9017000	9019000	it sucked remember the Vita what they
9019000	9021000	are you know stuff it's like oh
9021000	9023000	let me try this soccer game
9023000	9025000	wow that's that's shit okay cool
9025000	9027000	alright
9027000	9029000	one more story for you guys I swear it's like
9029000	9031000	it's like Blast from OLR's past
9031000	9033000	tonight and I guess Jason kind of referenced that
9033000	9035000	in the intro tonight it's kind of true
9035000	9037000	because we have one more story here tonight and it's about
9037000	9039000	one of our favorite
9039000	9041000	DDR knockoffs they ever had
9041000	9043000	it was a game called Dance Dance
9043000	9045000	Immolation and if you didn't know about
9045000	9047000	this game this was the DDR
9047000	9049000	game where if you made a misstep it would
9049000	9051000	literally set you on fire
9051000	9053000	and you're probably wondering how in the hell is this legal
9053000	9055000	well A you had
9055000	9057000	to wear this hugely flame
9057000	9059000	retardant suit and all this stuff to even
9059000	9061000	play the game and I'm sure you had to sign waiver after
9061000	9063000	waiver and B it was
9063000	9065000	the kind of thing that they would just take to Burning Man
9065000	9067000	and like that type of like artsy
9067000	9069000	stuff that's what you expect to see at Burning Man like that weird
9069000	9071000	stuff also
9071000	9073000	there were some other festivals Dance Dance Immolation went
9073000	9075000	to including the fine arts festival
9075000	9077000	a Denmark
9077000	9079000	thing called Smuck Fest
9079000	9081000	DDR for hipsters
9081000	9083000	but anyway
9083000	9085000	the game was officially retired
9085000	9087000	at Burning Man 2013
9087000	9089000	and then the display was
9089000	9091000	ripped apart and then in
9091000	9093000	true Burning Man what the fuck are they even doing
9093000	9095000	anymore fashion and look I have friends that
9095000	9097000	go to Burning Man and love it and swear by it and
9097000	9099000	I'm not knocking it but I'm just saying
9099000	9101000	the randomness
9101000	9103000	of some of this shit doesn't help the
9103000	9105000	theories that everybody's on drugs there
9105000	9107000	I'm just saying
9107000	9109000	I'm just saying
9109000	9111000	I'm just saying but anyhow
9111000	9113000	the way they destroyed it
9113000	9115000	what I meant to say is that
9115000	9117000	they dropped a piano on it
9117000	9119000	actually they dropped
9119000	9121000	a piano on what was left and since I know
9121000	9123000	Dark Soccer is dying to see
9123000	9125000	here it is
9125000	9127000	they dropped
9127000	9129000	an old
9129000	9131000	powder blue upright
9131000	9133000	and then
9133000	9135000	all the people I need to go to
9135000	9137000	Burning Man Rob it's just so fucking hard
9137000	9139000	no no
9139000	9141000	but
9141000	9143000	I love you
9143000	9145000	if you want to take drugs and run naked through the desert
9145000	9147000	I guess you can do that I love you
9147000	9149000	but sometimes
9149000	9151000	little things make you pretty
9151000	9153000	irritable and going to
9153000	9155000	the desert
9155000	9157000	for seven days
9157000	9159000	I'd probably want to murder everybody
9159000	9161000	I don't know where these people
9161000	9163000	poop
9163000	9165000	they have an RV
9165000	9167000	I guess it's RVs or whatever
9167000	9169000	there's no such thing as money
9169000	9171000	it's a barter system
9171000	9173000	Dark Soccer
9173000	9175000	I don't think you'd enjoy it
9175000	9177000	I think you'd complain a little bit
9177000	9179000	I probably wouldn't
9179000	9181000	every so often I want to go see
9181000	9183000	some of this stuff in person
9183000	9185000	and then you just reminded me
9185000	9187000	no air conditioning
9187000	9189000	fuck that shit I can't stand hot
9189000	9191000	and I live in Sacramento
9191000	9193000	what am I thinking
9193000	9195000	well you're on drugs
9195000	9197000	I'm on the drugs that keep me from murdering people
9197000	9199000	I just want to make it clear
9199000	9201000	I'm just teasing
9201000	9203000	I don't want to offend the people because I have friends that go to this
9203000	9205000	and they have a great time and they always tell me I should go
9205000	9207000	but I'm like my
9207000	9209000	red headed ass cannot
9209000	9211000	handle seven days
9211000	9213000	in the desert
9213000	9215000	it's not going to happen
9215000	9217000	I will watch the YouTubes
9217000	9219000	what if you went through the desert on a horse with no name
9221000	9223000	I don't even want to do this show anymore
9223000	9225000	alright
9225000	9227000	I'm just kidding
9227000	9229000	I do want to talk to you on Skype
9229000	9231000	maybe you'll have a better topic to talk about
9231000	9233000	1-877-GAME-OLR
9233000	9235000	talk about Rob's red headed ass
9235000	9237000	stop being weird
9237000	9239000	our username on Skype
9239000	9241000	Orange Lounge Radio

9243000	9245000	Bobby Black Wolf is in our chat room
9245000	9247000	saying I go to Dragon Con
9247000	9249000	instead of Burning Man
9249000	9251000	they're at the same time

9253000	9255000	that's my new drug of choice too
9255000	9257000	I did really love Dragon Con this year
9257000	9259000	I can't wait to go back
9259000	9261000	I can poke fun at myself too
9261000	9263000	because I said everyone's on drugs at Burning Man
9263000	9265000	well at Dragon Con everybody's drunk
9265000	9267000	and I say that as a proud Dragon Con attendee
9267000	9269000	responsibly
9269000	9271000	we're responsibly drunk
9271000	9273000	but I'm just saying
9273000	9275000	Rob, next year, Fauna Mae
9275000	9277000	I really do want to go back to Fauna Mae
9277000	9279000	you should cosplay Black Mage

9309000	9311000	look, I can't help it if Lala
9311000	9313000	is really a cross dresser
9313000	9315000	no I'm kidding
9315000	9317000	I don't know if you are listening to these shows
9317000	9319000	I don't shout them out enough here on the program
9319000	9321000	unfortunately we don't really have a shout out segment
9321000	9323000	but I do want to give a shout out to folks
9323000	9325000	like Game Buoy, you know them
9325000	9327000	very well, right?
9327000	9329000	Koopa Club, I don't know if you're listening to them
9329000	9331000	but they're a lot of fun, they're out of Chicago
9331000	9333000	you would love them
9333000	9335000	Video Game Realness, Canadian, hilarious
9335000	9337000	they kind of do what we do here
9337000	9339000	where they're all at one table in one room
9339000	9341000	and they should send us some poutine
9343000	9345000	he was bitching about soggy fries
9345000	9347000	from Wingstop earlier
9347000	9349000	I do not want FedExed poutine
9349000	9351000	there's actually a place in town you can get poutine
9351000	9353000	alright, Game Bar
9353000	9355000	is another one
9355000	9357000	no, it's an actual restaurant
9357000	9359000	not a strip club
9359000	9361000	no, Poon-teen
9361000	9363000	I'm sorry
9363000	9365000	you're thinking of Poon-teen
9367000	9369000	shut up
9369000	9371000	we did already have Kirby
9371000	9373000	birth 1877
9373000	9375000	Game O.L.R. or a username on Skype
9375000	9377000	Orange Lounge Radio, you need to call us
9377000	9379000	or it's going to be the Poutine Hour
9379000	9381000	and Loki may not
9381000	9383000	give you what you think that is
9383000	9385000	with the Poutine Hour
9385000	9389000	or we could go to Last Minute Stories
9389000	9391000	while we wait for some calls
9391000	9393000	sure, why not
9393000	9395000	let's talk about Grand Theft Auto 5
9395000	9397000	it's number 2 in Japan
9397000	9399000	after debuting
9399000	9401000	what was number 1 though, I'm kind of curious
9401000	9403000	oh, Pokemon
9403000	9405000	anyway, number 2 is not bad
9405000	9407000	they're corrupt, y'all
9407000	9409000	they are, they're going to have to do something about it
9413000	9415000	yeah, that's it
9415000	9417000	that's all I got
9417000	9419000	there were some stories on
9419000	9421000	the Xbox One also is not going to support
9421000	9423000	third party headsets at launch
9423000	9425000	not until 2014
9425000	9427000	there were some
9427000	9429000	stories on Zelda this week
9429000	9431000	that we didn't get to, and I don't remember what they were
9431000	9433000	does it involve Poutine?
9433000	9435000	yes
9435000	9437000	yes, because Poutine is
9437000	9439000	the national food of Hyrule
9439000	9441000	if you do the dungeons in a certain order
9441000	9443000	you can actually collect the gravy and the
9443000	9445000	cheese curd power up
9445000	9447000	and go to town
9447000	9449000	we have pianos
9449000	9451000	dropping on DDR machines that set people on fire
9451000	9453000	what
9453000	9455000	what, I just haven't done that in a while
9457000	9459000	I thought you were cutting sugar out
9459000	9461000	of your diet, yet you sound like
9461000	9463000	like a four year old that
9463000	9465000	just ate a Snickers bar
9465000	9467000	because I now have quite stable blood sugar and I'm hyper all the time
9467000	9469000	alright, fair enough
9469000	9471000	alright, yes, thank you actdeft, I'm going to Twitter topics
9471000	9473000	I'm trying, I'm doing Twitter topics
9473000	9475000	I want someone to call us
9475000	9477000	who hasn't called before
9477000	9479000	because I'm running out of things to say Poutine
9479000	9481000	about
9481000	9483000	that is actually
9483000	9485000	true, ssh100map
9485000	9487000	you misspelled
9487000	9489000	p-o-u-t-i-n-e, Poutine
9489000	9491000	and dongles
9491000	9493000	those are like two, you know another word that makes me
9493000	9495000	giggle like that, balls
9497000	9499000	I'm turning dark side with my stuff
9499000	9501000	oh thank god, we're getting a call
9501000	9503000	thank the lord
9503000	9505000	somebody's going to help us talk about something
9505000	9507000	maybe Canadian, maybe not, I don't know
9507000	9509000	hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio, who's this?
9509000	9511000	hey, this is Zappi, and I officially endorse Poutine
9511000	9513000	what's that?
9513000	9515000	I officially endorse Poutine
9515000	9517000	are you Canadian?
9517000	9519000	I'm from French Canada, so it's really
9519000	9521000	I love Poutine so much
9521000	9523000	god dammit
9523000	9525000	and I haven't had it since Louisiana
9525000	9527000	alright Zappi, have a great night
9527000	9529000	no, I'm just kidding
9529000	9531000	what did you call in to talk to us about tonight, Zappi?
9531000	9533000	well, besides Poutine, I was
9533000	9535000	going to talk about me playing the Xbox One
9535000	9537000	this week
9537000	9539000	why, how'd that happen?
9539000	9541000	well, I just went to my local Best Buy
9541000	9543000	and lo and behold, they just had an Xbox One demo out
9543000	9545000	I went into my local
9545000	9547000	Best Buy, and like, I had to ask
9547000	9549000	to get a copy of Pokemon, why
9549000	9551000	like, may I buy a copy of Pokemon
9551000	9553000	because I don't see it on the shelf
9553000	9555000	I didn't see no Xbox Ones or PlayStations
9555000	9557000	apparently they got their shit together in Canada
9557000	9559000	you know why? Everyone's happy
9559000	9561000	because they're eating french fries smothered in gravy
9561000	9563000	and, cheese curds
9563000	9565000	alright, well I hate to break it to you, but they had no Pokemon
9565000	9567000	oh
9567000	9569000	dicks, I'm just kidding, alright
9569000	9571000	is that why you went there?
9571000	9573000	we're moving to Canada tomorrow, by the way
9573000	9575000	so you went there, Zappi, to get Pokemon
9575000	9577000	and you ended up with Xbox One?
9577000	9579000	well, I was going to get the Pokemon from my boyfriend
9579000	9581000	and, no
9581000	9583000	oh, ok, alright
9583000	9585000	well, how was the Xbox One?
9585000	9587000	what'd you play?
9587000	9589000	they had fours of five
9589000	9591000	oh, ok, cool
9591000	9593000	I'll say this, it's very pretty
9593000	9595000	but there's one thing that really has me concerned
9595000	9597000	they had this demo unit
9597000	9599000	that looked like a complete factory finished Xbox
9599000	9601000	and the game was stuttering
9601000	9603000	like no tomorrow
9603000	9605000	really?
9605000	9607000	it's because it's not actually, it's just
9607000	9609000	the PC and the
9609000	9611000	units, I don't think it's actually the
9611000	9613000	well, actually it's the test units, I think
9613000	9615000	they had like a clear
9615000	9617000	container for it, it looked like
9617000	9619000	a finished Xbox One
9619000	9621000	but it's probably not a finished version of the game, remember
9621000	9623000	fours of five isn't done yet, they need to
9623000	9625000	patch in the rest of the game when it comes out
9625000	9627000	we're only a month out, too, I mean
9627000	9629000	I would think that the real deal is starting to show up
9629000	9631000	but this is the copy
9631000	9633000	that they were confident enough to bring to a retail
9633000	9635000	store and have people try out
9635000	9637000	and you know, and funny
9637000	9639000	enough, I was teasing Bobby Blackwolf
9639000	9641000	because he has the show before us here at VOG Network
9641000	9643000	and I was teasing him earlier because he was talking
9643000	9645000	about demos, and I said, well you know, Bobby
9645000	9647000	he will make his
9647000	9649000	impression off a video game based off the demo
9649000	9651000	and that's that, because I think back to Nino Cooney
9651000	9653000	and how he refuses to play that full game
9653000	9655000	because the demo was so awful, which it was
9655000	9657000	but the game's really good
9657000	9659000	I bring that up because, you know, if you're gonna
9659000	9661000	make your impressions off this in-store
9661000	9663000	demo unit, then yeah, it should run
9663000	9665000	a little better than being stuttery all over
9665000	9667000	the place
9667000	9669000	besides that, it was very pretty
9669000	9671000	the controller is really awesome, I want one of those
9671000	9673000	and it plays like
9673000	9675000	Forza
9675000	9677000	but more like the old Forzas
9677000	9679000	and not like Forza Horizon Arcady, right?
9679000	9681000	no, no, it's like the numbered
9681000	9683000	Forza games
9683000	9685000	fair enough, were they
9685000	9687000	showing anything else, like Killer Instinct or any of that
9687000	9689000	or just Forza?
9689000	9691000	nope, it was the Forza show
9691000	9693000	they had two reps they probably trained over the
9693000	9695000	weekend showing it off
9695000	9697000	fair enough
9697000	9699000	I was gonna say though
9699000	9701000	since we were talking about Pokemon a minute ago
9701000	9703000	have you tried playing the Pokemon in 3D?
9703000	9705000	it kind of stutters too
9705000	9707000	yeah, that was a little bit disappointing
9707000	9709000	as soon as you turn off the 3D, it's perfectly fine
9709000	9711000	but
9711000	9713000	I guess that's why the whole game
9713000	9715000	isn't in 3D to begin with
9715000	9717000	they want you to not notice
9717000	9719000	I guess so
9719000	9721000	it's kind of interesting
9721000	9723000	at the end of the day though
9723000	9725000	maybe we are hitting that point
9725000	9727000	because it's no big deal
9727000	9729000	I don't feel short handed
9729000	9731000	or like I'm losing something by not having the 3D
9731000	9733000	you know what I mean?
9733000	9735000	Dark Sakura, what the hell are you doing in chat?
9735000	9737000	I don't know, I tried to put like one stupid little link
9737000	9739000	and the whole thing copied
9739000	9741000	and Dark Sakura got kicked for flooding the chat
9741000	9743000	you know what?
9743000	9745000	she was speaking in tongues
9745000	9747000	that was actually a complete and total accident
9747000	9749000	whoops, alright
9749000	9751000	good job Dark Sakura
9751000	9753000	sorry Zappi
9753000	9755000	well the thing is, sure, 3D isn't that useful
9755000	9757000	but this is what they sold the system on
9757000	9759000	you have 3D games
9759000	9761000	and it looks like they're moving away from the thing
9761000	9763000	they were selling their own system on
9763000	9765000	well, what's the verdict for you?
9765000	9767000	are you on board with next gen gaming?
9767000	9769000	are you gonna get an Xbox One
9769000	9771000	or a Playstation 4?
9771000	9773000	well I'm considering it just because
9773000	9775000	I was able to pre-order an Xbox One
9775000	9777000	for $100 off
9779000	9781000	because I just used the staples to
9781000	9783000	stack a whole bunch of coupons
9783000	9785000	so you're gonna go
9785000	9787000	Xbox One with that money off then?
9787000	9789000	I'm thinking about it, because $400
9789000	9791000	it puts it at the same price as a PS4
9791000	9793000	that's true, if you can lessen the price
9793000	9795000	Xbox One does have
9795000	9797000	some exclusives that are
9797000	9799000	worth looking at
9799000	9801000	yeah, but on the other hand
9801000	9803000	the launch line up just isn't there
9803000	9805000	yeah, I hear ya
9805000	9807000	he's waiting six months, so there's nothing wrong with that
9807000	9809000	alright, well Zappi, I'm gonna let you go
9809000	9811000	to see if anybody else calls, but thanks for calling
9811000	9813000	I don't think we've heard from you in forever
9813000	9815000	and it's good to hear the impressions of the Xbox One
9815000	9817000	alright, cool, later
9817000	9819000	next time, Pre-Poutine
9819000	9821000	alright, sounds good, bye
9821000	9823000	bye
9823000	9825000	1877 Game OLR, our username on Skype
9825000	9827000	Orange Lounge Radio
9827000	9829000	I figured out what it did
9829000	9831000	it actually copied the image data and not the URL
9831000	9833000	I have no idea how that happened
9833000	9835000	because I highlighted the URL to copy it
9835000	9837000	so
9837000	9839000	my iPad is currently the devil
9839000	9841000	1877 Game OLR
9841000	9843000	our username on Skype
9843000	9845000	Orange Lounge Radio
9845000	9847000	we need more poutine
9847000	9849000	I'm trying to go to tweets and see what else has been tweeted at us tonight
9849000	9851000	someone new should call us, I want new
9851000	9853000	I mean, I love all of you people
9853000	9855000	seriously, and I love talking with you, but we need someone new calling
9855000	9857000	new voices, new blood
9857000	9859000	we must sacrifice you to my iPad
9859000	9861000	so that
9861000	9863000	it doesn't spout
9863000	9865000	devil noise at us, again
9865000	9867000	actdef sent us a tweet, but it's a tweet from Eurogamer
9867000	9869000	about the extension of the games for gold
9869000	9871000	on 360, which I think we had talked about earlier
9871000	9873000	I was trying to see if there was more games
9873000	9875000	announced on it, but I don't think so
9875000	9877000	I didn't realize they got the exact same games in Europe
9877000	9879000	but I guess that makes sense, that they do
9879000	9881000	um, Sturlock
9881000	9883000	tweeted us saying, what was the music from tonight
9883000	9885000	very awesome, well clearly
9885000	9887000	you're talking about the song Always by
9887000	9889000	Erasure, it's what we play during the FUGL
9889000	9891000	we need more Erasure on the show
9891000	9893000	we do, I can make that happen
9893000	9895000	don't, uh, don't think I won't
9895000	9897000	I think that's it for Twitter topics, I didn't get a whole lot tonight
9897000	9899000	so, twitter.com slash OLR
9899000	9901000	we need a new ending song
9901000	9903000	and it should be all through the years
9903000	9905000	alright, I'm gonna put out one more
9905000	9907000	call for phone calls, and then we're gonna
9907000	9909000	wrap it up, no, you should call tonight
9909000	9911000	Seattle, do it now
9911000	9913000	1877 game OLR
9913000	9915000	or username on skype
9915000	9917000	orange lounge radio
9917000	9919000	and we're out of last minute stories, right
9919000	9921000	yeah, is there any more
9921000	9923000	food stories somebody wants to tell
9923000	9925000	poutine
9925000	9927000	I think they have that actually over at sprouts
9927000	9929000	they, or even like uh, Whole Foods
9929000	9931000	or something like that, they have like their weird food over there
9931000	9933000	I could just make it at home
9933000	9935000	yeah, it's not that difficult
9935000	9937000	let's just sacrifice your face first
9937000	9939000	alright, degenerate Johnny
9939000	9941000	alright, well I guess nobody wants to call
9941000	9943000	that makes me sad, so I'm gonna close up the skype line
9943000	9945000	and I will encourage you guys to email us in a future week
9945000	9947000	mailbag at orange lounge radio dot com
9947000	9949000	or you can also send us a tweet
9949000	9951000	twitter dot com slash OLR
9951000	9953000	and uh, those are all the ways you can interact with us as well
9953000	9955000	uh, otherwise
9955000	9957000	that does it for another week of orange lounge radio
9957000	9959000	I just wanna say thank you guys
9959000	9961000	very much for listening to the show
9961000	9963000	um, the nominating stuff is over
9963000	9965000	for the podcast awards, but I do wanna give a quick
9965000	9967000	thank you, if you did take the time out of your day to nominate us
9967000	9969000	or at least nominate another deserving
9969000	9971000	independent podcast, even if it wasn't
9971000	9973000	us, I wanna say thank you
9973000	9975000	and uh, we'll know the results of that, I think
9975000	9977000	I think it's the same time as the show next week
9977000	9979000	so that could be interesting
9979000	9981000	so we can have our disappointment
9981000	9983000	drinks when we don't get nominated
9983000	9985000	we'll have a pile of poutine that we'll drown our sorrows in
9985000	9987000	yes, fist bump
9987000	9989000	poutine
9989000	9991000	do you want some poutine, Loki?
9991000	9993000	is that part of your diet?
9993000	9995000	budget for it
9995000	9997000	I don't think there's a ketogenic version of poutine
9997000	9999000	just budget for it, that's all you have to do
9999000	10001000	alright, um, thank you very much
10001000	10003000	for listening to our show
10003000	10005000	if you like what you heard here at orange lounge radio
10005000	10007000	we don't ask for your money, all we do
10007000	10009000	just tell a friend or 5 or 25
10009000	10011000	about the program, help us spread the word
10011000	10013000	about OLR and grow our family
10013000	10015000	cause you know what, we've got some pretty cool people
10015000	10017000	that listen to this show, both live
10017000	10019000	and in the podcast forum, thank you very much
10019000	10021000	for participating and being a part of it
10021000	10023000	thank you very much
10023000	10025000	you could also leave us a nice review on itunes
10025000	10027000	stitcher, thumbs up, you know, all the places where you found this podcast
10027000	10029000	other people will find podcasts too
10029000	10031000	um, it's time to go around and get everybody's final thought
10031000	10033000	Loki, starting us off tonight, your final thought
10033000	10035000	uh, well
10035000	10037000	we'll be playing more grant the thought of this week
10037000	10039000	and hopefully you should see an announcement
10039000	10041000	about the next game night
10041000	10043000	we'll maybe do another game night
10043000	10045000	or maybe we'll do like one week
10045000	10047000	cause friday seems to be a lot better
10047000	10049000	for people, cause it's hard to
10049000	10051000	play, so maybe
10051000	10053000	maybe we'll do another game night friday
10053000	10055000	and then we'll switch it up to the next platform
10055000	10057000	the next friday or something like that
10057000	10059000	switch off until
10059000	10061000	you know, some other games come out
10061000	10063000	um, my final thought tonight is
10063000	10065000	um, I don't know
10065000	10067000	uh, I
10067000	10069000	uh, I need to get working on my halloween costume
10069000	10071000	cause I haven't started yet and I really need to do that
10071000	10073000	and I need to not slack off
10073000	10075000	and also I need to do more live game streaming
10075000	10077000	cause I've been slacking off on that too, so
10077000	10079000	uh, even though I was joking earlier about
10079000	10081000	how everybody's live streaming, oh well
10081000	10083000	I'm gonna do it too, cause there's some other
10083000	10085000	games out there I'm playing that I wanna show you guys
10085000	10087000	that aren't just Final Fantasy XIV, believe it or not
10087000	10089000	and last but not least, Dark Soccer, your final thought tonight
10089000	10091000	the closest thing I have to cheese
10091000	10093000	courage is cottage cheese
10093000	10095000	that sucks
10095000	10097000	could you put cottage cheese on french fries?
10097000	10099000	I can't eat french fries
10099000	10101000	oh, alright
10101000	10103000	you know what?
10103000	10105000	I feel healthier
10105000	10107000	I feel healthier than I have in the last three weeks
10107000	10109000	and I wanna start
10109000	10111000	playing DDR again, that's my final thought
10111000	10113000	alright, good luck
10113000	10115000	I wanna make it a thing
10115000	10117000	alright, well
