15663	22735	A former would-be dancing game slips down and seeks a modern revival, and the creators of Missing Ribbon announce their latest adventure game.
23055	26301	Everything old is new again on tonight's episode, which begins right now.
31809	37010	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
37090	45132	It is Orange Lounge Radio for this episode number 524, October the 20th of 2013.
45772	51173	My name is Rob Roberts, here to talk with you about the latest and greatest in the video gaming world with my co-hosts.
51353	54254	First off, say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
54884	55905	I have the coffee jitters.
56145	56985	A coffee jitter?
57046	57446	What is that?
57526	58507	What is the coffee jitters?
58727	63370	I had, granted it was decaf, but I still had a venti americano before I came over.
63610	63830	Yeah.
64090	67212	And then I had coffee just now, and I've had lamb.
67453	68153	Now you want another.
68673	68854	No.
69454	69814	I'm good.
69934	70795	You don't want any more coffee?
71435	73677	I thought that's how you fix the coffee jitters, was with more coffee.
74218	75700	No, I'm actually quite good.
75920	76301	All right.
76762	80026	Are you sure you're not going to be driving home and then, Dan, coffee.
80106	82269	I've got coffee at home if it comes to that.
83190	84913	Old OLR in-joke for those that don't know.
85333	86475	Rob!
87202	88503	We have a few of those here.
88543	90685	We have been doing this show for quite a long time.
91806	93228	Our longest running inside joke.
93248	95289	Say hello everybody to Tech Master Loki.
95470	95710	Hi.
96130	96871	How you doing, Loki?
97271	97912	I'm doing fine.
98012	98593	I'm just kidding.
98653	100274	I just didn't have any other good transition.
100574	101195	How have you been?
102676	103457	Okay.
104118	104558	Yeah?
104798	106200	Anything new and exciting going on?
106220	108502	What's your latest projects you've been working on?
108862	110804	You are, after all, the man of many projects.
112004	112885	Well, let's see.
113005	115726	I'm still trying to work on finishing up.
115886	116947	Actually, that's what I'm doing right now.
116967	118387	I'm looking for a 12-volt battery.
119528	126631	Just that separate screen thing, the wireless second screen for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
126771	127111	Oh, right.
127131	128472	You talked about that a couple weeks back.
128492	129032	How's that going?
129372	130213	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
146508	168256	so I'm just trying to find something that's got somewhat decent battery life and I don't know I took apart my wireless HDMI receiver the other day and thankfully it's actually the board inside it's a lot smaller than I thought it would be and they have like a daughter board on there as well so it's going to be easy to take apart and then I don't know
168789	173310	Once you get this second screen project of yours finished, what's the first thing you're going to do with it?
173430	175250	Like, what's the first game you're going to play with it?
175270	176911	Grand Theft Auto V, of course.
177371	180571	Because, you know, that tells me what's the whole point of this project.
181892	191374	But here's the thing, though, is I don't really need it anymore because I have a setup in my living room where I have my office chair there and my computer monitor since I don't really have a computer on.
191414	192934	So I actually play Grand Theft Auto on that.
193754	200000	Um, so technically I don't really need it anymore because I still have a screen to play it on while my wife watches TV.
201000	201881	But I'm still going to build it.
201901	203402	That's fair.
203442	204463	Because it's a thing.
204944	208847	It's become a thing and now you have to see it through to completion.
208927	215772	I had to prototype something this week that it's some thing that they're planning on or trying to sell or something.
216313	216633	It's like a...
217754	226516	Some will figure with like a USB, like Wi-Fi and Bluetooth adapters built into it and a thumb drive or something.
227597	229057	So I got to play with that this week.
229097	230438	But yeah, I do want to make this.
230478	235039	The thing I got to do after I get all the parts.
235079	242101	So really only parts I have left are the battery and probably a 12 volt step down to 5 volt.
244122	263156	and then some miscellaneous ports and wires and then once that's all done and I figure out how I want to be laid out I have to get the wood to build a mold or yeah sort of I guess a mold for vacuum forming I have to build the vacuum forming rig which that's easy because that's just a box so
265117	265637	Oh my gosh.
265718	266018	All right.
266178	266918	Yeah.
267119	268239	Let's go to our chat room.
268259	276705	We do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.
276805	282930	And if you are listening live on this Sunday, you can join us in our live chat room, live.vognetwork.com.
283110	290635	And Ragenator wanting to know in chat, what baconified food product did Loki bring to the OLR studio tonight?
290996	292897	If it's your first time ever listening to OLR...
293277	295079	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
315421	316322	All right, meat salad.
317283	320626	I didn't bring anything with bacon on it just because I wasn't that hungry.
320947	325251	And so I just kind of got – it's a two-cheeseburger meal from McDonald's because it's cheap.
325512	331398	I didn't really need to eat anything, but I know because the last time I skipped dinner, I was just like, oh, I'm not hungry.
331418	332018	I'm going to skip dinner.
332038	334061	And then when I got home at 10 o'clock, I was hungry.
334761	337284	So I just – I got something kind of small.
338846	342129	Because I don't really like going to McDonald's in the evening because their fries are stale.
342449	344031	And yeah, their fries were stale again.
344391	347754	I ate them anyways, but they were stale and I'm not enjoying that.
348014	349616	And their burgers weren't even that good either.
349656	352519	So it was just kind of eating just to be full.
352939	353700	That's pretty much it.
353880	355180	I'd love to see you bring some In-N-Out.
356741	365823	Okay, I would, but to reliably get here on time with In-N-Out, it's just a crapshoot because I can't tell how busy they're going to be, and sometimes it's like 30 minutes to get out of there.
366023	369504	Yeah, I just didn't do that.
369704	372325	Although I did eat just bacon the other day for lunch.
372405	375686	That's all I had was bacon, so I guess that counts.
376466	379907	And so I ran out of bacon because we had to eat the whole package before it was gone.
380427	382008	My wife says, well, you ate all the bacon.
382048	383669	I'm like, dude, I only had like three pieces.
384370	386852	So you ate all the bacon.
387252	387892	That's right.
389113	392095	You know, your weakness for bacon is like my weakness for pumpkin.
392135	393917	And this is the time of year, let me tell you.
394917	395658	You're shaking your head.
395678	395938	That's right.
395958	396899	You don't like the pumpkin stuff.
397399	398720	Went to Trader Joe's the other day.
398900	406405	Alan and I loaded up on all this pumpkin stuff, like pumpkin butter, pumpkin bread mix, pumpkin macaroons.
407006	407526	I saw those.
407886	408147	What?
408567	408787	Yeah.
408867	409067	Oh, yeah.
409087	409608	You want to try one?
410348	411330	I need to read the label.
411350	412432	Oh wait, yeah, you're on a diet.
412472	413313	Never mind.
413353	413954	I should be encouraging.
413974	415878	Let me read the label to see if it's good.
416158	417120	Okay.
417140	417741	Go check the freezer.
419164	421705	Reginator says Burger King is better than McDonald's.
421845	423785	Yes, I 100% agree.
424105	427786	Unfortunately, there is like four McDonald's on the way here and one Burger King.
428206	431147	And I just don't feel like stopping off the freeway to stop at the Burger King.
431467	437768	If the McDonald's by me was a Burger King, I'd be stopping at Burger King because I like Burger King way better than McDonald's.
437828	443609	Just FYI, I'd be able to have one if I wasn't so close already to my limit.
444470	446510	Next week, if they're not gone.
447119	448840	I have to stay honest with myself.
449040	449381	All right.
449641	450121	You can do it.
450782	451102	All right.
453223	453543	Let's see.
453884	455265	I had a kickoff topic for tonight.
455305	461048	I don't know how successful this will be, but I was thinking, you know, we're getting into the Halloween season like full swing now.
461629	463390	And I don't know about you guys.
463470	466512	I'm not seeing as many like costume stores this year.
466612	468493	Like last year, it seemed like there was one on every corner.
468934	470495	This year, I'm not seeing as many.
470595	471415	No, I'm not seeing as many.
471836	473937	Maybe it's just the normal locations I see them at.
473957	475038	I don't know.
475538	476778	I've seen quite a few.
476859	477119	Have you?
477559	482521	Well, I thought I would ask what good video game costumes you might be seeing out there.
482581	485001	Like, are you seeing anything gaming inspired?
485462	488743	And what types of great gaming costumes have you seen in the past?
489623	496986	But this is a tricky subject because my mind always goes to these great gaming cosplays I've seen before, which technically is a little different than Halloween.
497828	501113	Yeah, it's just Halloween is the day that cosplay is like.
501153	503035	Cosplay is Halloween for grown-ups every day.
505058	506299	Or every other weekend, really.
506800	510885	See, the difference between cosplay and Halloween is Halloween you get candy.
511907	513990	Cosplay you get sexually assaulted.
515471	518072	I shouldn't laugh at that, but sadly, it's true.
518772	519432	All right.
520032	522953	So what kind of good costumes have you guys been seeing?
522973	529855	Because I find it interesting how Mario and Luigi have really kind of gone into the mainstream.
529875	531495	Well, I mean, it really shouldn't be a surprise.
531535	533096	Those games are obviously like landmark games.
533136	536597	But it's just funny how common that costume is now these days.
536697	540878	When I remember growing up, if you were to dress up like Mario, nobody knew who you were.
541218	542838	Actdeft in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com
562084	562564	Good times.
562645	563866	You know what I realize I still have?
564467	566189	My Organization 13 coat.
566549	566809	Yeah.
567390	569352	So, I don't know.
570834	573657	It was me and Kristen and Megzi.
574578	579564	We all went as our OCs, our Organization 13 OCs, which was pretty fun.
580399	601697	I do remember at Disneyland seeing a child dressed up as Sora And I was like, you have the coolest parents ever Because you don't see any Kingdom Hearts related stuff at Disneyland anymore Which is really sad Except for the pins I guess now, I think there's one or two now But yeah, probably just because you're starting to see more and more Kingdom Hearts With the game releases and leading up to 3 and so forth
602589	607695	I know that there's the Organization XIII Mickey, and then there's one other that I haven't been able to find.
608657	611941	I've seen the Organization XIII Mickey, but it'd be interesting.
612602	614564	It's never going to happen, Regenerator.
614725	615606	What's Regenerator saying?
615706	616827	Loki's tingle costume?
616968	618550	No, I think that's a lost cause.
618570	619271	We gave up on that.
619891	623092	Don't get me wrong, I have the build for that, but it's just not going to happen.
624193	629255	I just want to buy that much spandex.
629315	630916	What's your kid going as this year?
631236	632596	Are you doing anything gaming?
632616	633397	He's a firework.
633757	635818	Oh wait, that's right, you mentioned that on a previous episode.
636258	638499	Yeah, my sister is building the costume for that.
639179	647903	Although, I'm wondering though if they're not going to know what he is, because the costume kind of looks like a black t-shirt with garland wrapped around it.
648423	649944	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
667859	669300	Like those things you get at the dollar store.
669320	670481	Stuff you would think that you would see.
670501	672042	Yeah, I've seen like wrapped in gifts and stuff.
672183	675045	Yeah, stuff you would kind of picture at like 4th of July.
675165	677066	So, you know, he's going to have that.
677227	678087	Because that's what he wanted to be.
678107	681690	He wanted to be, you know... He should have Stars and Stripes forever playing wherever he walks.
682591	684793	But, uh... So, yeah, that's what he's going to do.
685033	687074	I'm not doing a costume this year just because...
688456	689357	I don't feel it
703575	703996	It's weird.
704036	709799	It's the first Halloween I've had in a while where I don't have something with Rocky Horror Picture Show going on because that all finished up weeks early this year.
710159	711360	So I don't really have anything this year.
711460	718343	So I did get invited to a party that's right after Halloween that's still a dress-up party.
718464	724267	It's something that Captain Spike is doing, which is the theme is around internet memes.
724307	724667	Okay.
724887	725647	That sounds awesome.
725707	730728	So I know what I'm doing, but I'm not going to say because I know Captain Spike listens to this occasionally.
730828	732869	So I don't want to spoil it because it's got to be a surprise.
733289	736430	But I'll tell you guys off air because I think you guys will get a kick out of it.
738450	738750	Let's see.
738790	740750	Go into our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com.
741051	743231	Bobby Blackwolf says, a VOG starter.
743751	745131	Buy the spandex for Loki.
745832	747592	I'm not – it's –
748412	750734	You're never going to let it die.
750774	753016	Don't buy spandex for Loki.
753516	754037	No offense.
755418	756839	I think the world would be a better place.
758040	760121	But then we can get the glamour shots and everything.
760141	761943	I mean, come on.
763184	763504	Let's see.
763544	768648	Code Man in our chatroom says, trying to convince my wife to let me dress our daughter up as a white mage.
768748	771350	Oh, I saw the pictures of the concept stuff on Facebook.
771370	772251	That would be pretty awesome.
772271	772731	That is cute.
772751	773331	That's adorable.
773832	775553	So a little baby white mage.
775573	777074	Well, not baby, but toddler white mage.
777214	777755	It's pretty cute.
778355	796757	now I'm sure this is something that they have like a white mage hoodie like that has like the you know I'm sure it's not horrifically difficult to make you have like just like a white plain hoodie thing and then you kind of put the fringe on it like I mean I don't know how well uh convincing it would look but something like that so
798076	811219	It really actually wouldn't be that hard because to do one of the concepts of a white mage, your basic robe would be a pretty big circle skirt with sleeves sewn on and then just a hoodie top.
811339	812840	I mean it really would be that easy.
813260	818541	I have a pattern for one that I was going to do as a cosplay eventually, but never did.
819401	822885	Yeah, it doesn't seem like, it depends what kind of white mage you're going for.
823485	824406	It wouldn't be too difficult.
824426	828631	If you're trying to go as Yuna, that might be a little trickier, because you've got to get the right colors and all that.
828691	831474	And you also have to be, you know, anorexic.
832815	834196	She's also not a white mage, I mean.
834737	835638	She's a summoner.
835658	837860	Oh yeah, she's a summoner slash white mage.
837920	840723	If you were going to be a white mage, then you would have to be What's-Her-Face from 9.
842526	844048	DarkSakura.com
855860	857461	I played more Fractal.
858081	860602	It's just my chill-out kind of game, so I love it.
860922	862523	I'm playing more Bejeweled.
863123	870005	I actually broke a million points twice on one of the modes, which is actually kind of difficult.
872166	876828	I played Final Fantasy XIV, which I am at the Bukake Manor.
878445	879325	or was it Hauke?
879425	880266	Hawk Manor, yeah.
880326	880606	Yeah.
881706	885007	And so I need help doing that one eventually.
885967	888448	And what else did I play?
889068	895209	I actually played Mass Effect 2 because Becky has this thing for me using the high-res mod.
895529	903652	Well, not really doing the high-res mod but I do the high-res mod anyway to take screen caps for her of her shepherd so that she can have pretty pictures.
904172	904892	So that's what I did.
905752	921082	and then I'm actually playing through I'm trying to finish my game on three just because I should finish it but that and I need more screencap fodder because I'm really really really really running out of ideas for my stupid caption bullshit
923781	925843	and, yes, Bitchface Aerith.
927684	929505	And I do not name Aerith Bitchface.
929545	933107	I name her Aerith with a T-H, but she's still Bitchface in my esteem.
935049	937210	I played something... Animal Crossing.
938171	941473	And I feel bad because I was going to open my village tonight and I left it at home.
941993	942173	So...
943294	945216	Sorry, I have three characters in my village now.
945336	952822	I have Sakura, I have Tsubasa, who I made just for the sole purpose of redecoration and making Ed move, because Ed's fucking creepy.
952842	954524	Did it work?
954824	957606	No, he's still fucking there, the shit.
958427	961870	And I made a character for Julian, for Becky's son.
962170	962530	Oh, nice.
962691	965153	Because I don't know if I... I may have mentioned this before.
965273	970459	He sits with me when I play the game over there, and he practices his reading with Animal Crossing.
970479	976104	So I have to, you know, skip past kitty fuck and, you know, poot.
976204	977005	Well, poot's okay.
977406	980249	But I have to skip past the one that says pussy.
980909	981710	The naughty language.
981730	982851	Kitty fuck and all that.
983772	983952	So...
986923	987344	and DarkSakura.com
1005220	1010563	Dan busted out the NES and played Kickle Cubicle.
1010803	1014324	It's just the way you say Kickle that makes it sort of come out the other way.
1014564	1015305	I remember that game.
1015625	1022428	So now that we have the NES hooked up, I'm actually going to be playing... I'm thinking about trying to rebuild my skills on Guardian Legend.
1023989	1024689	Nothing wrong with that.
1024849	1030232	I am going to be in tears for the next month until I remember how to play that damn game because that game's fucking hard.
1030877	1031698	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1046052	1046932	GameNights.
1047012	1048593	Yeah, I was hearing some good stuff about that on Twitter.
1048613	1049033	How'd that go?
1049653	1068020	Well, the first night when I was doing PS3, I was trying to do video capture, and I have the Elgato capture thing, but for some damn reason, it would not pick up the PlayStation 3, even through the component cables, which is weird, though, because I thought I had another set of component cables, so maybe I'm just doing it wrong or something.
1068120	1069161	I thought I had one that was...
1069861	1083691	The PlayStation, actually, the multi-AV input thing, it was just that to the Elgato, and I can't find that, so I used the component thing, and that did not work out at all.
1083771	1085613	It just could not detect it for some reason.
1086413	1091597	But it was being finicky, even with my Xbox 360 is doing the same kind of bullshit.
1091797	1094739	So, kind of skipped capturing that stuff.
1094859	1097762	It's okay, though, because we only had about two people, I think, the first night.
1098402	1105924	Then on Friday, we did the second game night, which was on the Xbox 360 version of Grand Theft Auto Online.
1105944	1106684	That was a great turnout.
1106724	1110025	We had about four or five people, including Bobby.
1110565	1118787	And we basically... Bobby didn't want to do any death matches, so we just did races and parachute drops.
1119327	1122828	And then the one I think I had the most fun with was Top Fun.
1123628	1126271	Top Fun is a team game.
1126812	1130916	One team is in jets and the other team is in cars.
1132197	1133438	Cars are motorcycles usually.
1134259	1139984	They have to get from one point to another point on the map without getting killed by the people in the jets.
1141306	1142727	It was some pretty intense gameplay.
1142747	1148012	There was one where we had some other people join in with us, and we had all died.
1148472	1156720	And then we were just watching this guy just haul ass through the entire Los Santos area and stuff.
1156740	1160123	And there was this one where he hit a jump somehow and dodged two missiles.
1160363	1162485	And thankfully, I had the foresight to...
1163106	1163986	Capture everything.
1164046	1166927	So I have that all recorded and I'll be cutting a highlight reel.
1167167	1172169	The only thing that kind of sucks is I didn't manage to record my voice when I'm talking over voice chat.
1172189	1174429	So you hear a lot of one-sided conversations.
1175910	1177530	But next time we'll be prepared for that.
1177690	1179711	But still, four hours of stuff I've got to cut through.
1179771	1181171	So are you going to do it again next week?
1181211	1182831	Or is this like a one-to-one thing or what?
1183012	1186793	It may not be next week, but maybe in a couple weeks we'll do it again.
1188433	1197437	I don't know, I had a lot of fun, and we just, you know, we actually, I think we leveled up about five levels just playing that, you know, and it was great, so.
1197597	1197777	Nice.
1198157	1206401	It's hard, though, because I know people on the, you know, the East Coast and stuff, it's like really late, and Bobby goes up until like three in the morning, because we played until almost midnight, so.
1206461	1207361	He's always up that late, though.
1207681	1211503	He runs on West Coast time, even though he's over there in Atlanta.
1212203	1221451	Um, but yeah, so I'm gonna try to do it again, cause I'm really limited in my window of time, um, to actually play, cause, you know, I have to wait for my son to go to sleep, so.
1221471	1223672	Um, but yeah, I'll definitely do it again.
1224213	1224273	Um.
1226349	1227550	But yeah, it was a lot of fun.
1227630	1239396	And then aside from playing Grand Theft Auto Online those couple times, I also did play some of the single player and now I'm almost 86% done with my 100% storyline stuff.
1239436	1247380	I did the rest of the missions I had left and I did all of the, well, some more of the, what was it, the...
1248260	1257085	Offroad Races, Assassination Missions, and then some of the Tonya towing missions.
1257165	1263749	But the last one she has isn't triggered yet, so that's the only thing I'm waiting on to get all my Strangers and Freaks stuff done.
1266210	1292895	but yeah it's been a lot of fun and I'm trying to get the 100% so I can start doing that like Chiliad mystery stuff and I'll definitely be playing more online especially more on 360 because my co-workers flaked on me I had one of my co-workers up here on the Thursday night game so we played but I was the only one that had a headset that day so that was kind of difficult to get people together and he didn't really know how to join games so it was kind of
1294035	1294556	and DarkSakura.
1317596	1322498	I can see how they constantly re-invite people back into your game just to keep everyone in the same world.
1323679	1326400	We had a lot of fun, so definitely looking forward to doing that again soon.
1327400	1327721	Alright.
1328541	1331983	Well, be sure to let us all know when the next game night is for Grand Theft Auto.
1332183	1334844	And in the meantime, you can join the VOG crew, right?
1334984	1336905	Yeah, we've got like 46 people in there.
1336945	1337605	Holy moly.
1337865	1338125	Nice.
1338846	1339166	Very cool.
1340346	1341047	My gaming week.
1341707	1345930	Didn't play as much video games as I would have liked to this week, but I did play a little bit.
1346110	1348091	I've been playing some Final Fantasy XIV.
1349212	1350713	My White Mage is an endgame.
1350993	1356216	I don't know how many of you are playing Final Fantasy XIV out there or are an endgame, but if you are an endgame, then you'll understand what I say.
1356957	1361700	I got my Ifrit weapon from the Primal Fight, and then two days later got my Garuda one.
1361800	1366143	After so many tries on the Ifrit one, like two days later I get the better one from Garuda, but whatever.
1366443	1366923	DarkLightGear.com
1394000	1396462	and, let's see, what else did I play this week?
1397662	1409709	I went back and visited Pac-Man Championship Edition, because I don't know if you guys know, but they just came out with the Pac-Man Championship Edition Plus, like the Plus add-on, which is, it's pretty much just a free patch for Pac-Man Championship Edition.
1410069	1434026	but now they have a little bit of a store kind of built in there so you can buy some additional skins you can buy a couple additional mazes and a couple additional songs not a lot of stuff but uh you know just it's fun to go back and and kind of have a reason to play that again and I like what they did with like the Dig Dug skin and the uh Rally-X skin it doesn't change the game it just makes it look like you're playing Rally-X but it's like Pac-Man style so that's kind of
1434246	1436268	I don't know, I kind of like that that was something a little different there.
1436589	1437990	And some of the new songs are cool too.
1438030	1441274	They also have the original Championship Edition 1 song in there.
1441314	1444037	So it's kind of neat that you can go back and play that if you want.
1446140	1448983	The other new game that I've been playing this week...
1449804	1450165	Oh, thank you.
1450225	1451486	Actdeft is correcting me in our chatroom.
1451526	1452547	Live.vognetwork.com.
1452607	1454710	It's DX+, not Championship Edition.
1455030	1456312	Championship Edition was the first.
1456692	1457693	DX was the second.
1457793	1458774	Now there's DX+.
1459896	1463219	Excuse me if I'm getting confused with all these frickin' Pac-Man games.
1464141	1465382	Then we had Pac-Man and Ms.
1465422	1469046	Pac-Man and Junior Pac-Man and Baby Pac-Man and, yeah, Pac-Mania.
1469186	1469407	Anyway.
1471789	1473651	So, new game I played this week.
1474612	1480617	Last week I told the hilarious story about how I loaned my 3DS out to Princess Irene who then went to Japan.
1480897	1488224	Well, she came back from Japan, so today I was finally able to play Pokemon Y. So I haven't been able to play a lot of it, but I will say...
1489985	1499388	It's about time we finally get a next-gen Pokemon game, because this is the first time I've played a Pokemon game in a while where I'm like, oh wow, this looks really good.
1499668	1510171	This looks like it's running on the current hardware, because let's face it, Black 2 and White 2 and Black and White were not up to par with where the DS was at at that point.
1510211	1518653	And that's probably the decision to make those games DS and not 3DS probably plays into that a little bit.
1519053	1519894	Thanks for watching!
1537248	1550173	Yeah, and I'm loving that within just a few minutes of being in the game and kind of going into the first area, there's already a diverse amount of Pokemon in the very first area.
1550713	1554655	Like, you're not just going to get a bunch of Bidoofs and Pidgeys in the first area.
1555015	1561357	There's actually like seven different Pokemon, like enough where you're already sending Pokemon to the box within the first little zone.
1561757	1563358	Is the box like putting them to sleep?
1563778	1566439	No, it's putting them in the computer is what it is.
1567500	1569781	And there's a Pikachu in the very first zone.
1570241	1573542	And, you know, that's the type of Pokemon that people really want.
1573842	1581526	People don't go into a Pokemon game going, I really want a Pidgey, or I really want a Zigzag Zoon, or I don't know, maybe you do, but most people don't.
1581906	1584407	Most people want Pikachu.
1584727	1586288	They want the cute stuff, you know?
1586428	1588369	Oh, hell no, I want that dark dog-looking one.
1588389	1590149	I think it's awesome.
1590750	1590930	So...
1592050	1595794	Anyhow, I like that there was already that diversity and so forth.
1595814	1597756	And again, the combat looks great.
1598657	1603502	The only downer is if you're playing combat in 3D mode, very noticeable dip in quality.
1603902	1609127	And I'm sure you've heard this a lot of places, but I'm telling you too, very noticeable dip in quality.
1609468	1611550	It's almost as if this game was made for the 2DS.
1612851	1642042	honestly and I kind of think it was in some regards and I think most people will be playing it with the 3D off because like when you're walking around the map and everything it doesn't even really doesn't really use the 3D it only uses the 3D in the battles and maybe here and there like in the opening and things like that that's really it but I mean that doesn't really affect the game at the end of the day but it is a very interesting sign for maybe this 3DS or 3D thing is is gonna be gone a little sooner than we think they tricked you into buying another Game Boy didn't they
1643047	1646048	No, I did not buy... I waited for Irene to bring my other 3DS back.
1646148	1653991	No, I'm just saying that the whole thing... Remember, the thing that Nintendo is really good about is getting people to buy the Game Boy over and over and over again.
1654352	1660634	They'll have the Game Boy, the Game Boy Color, the Game Boy Pocket, the Game Boy Advance, SP, and so on and so forth, different colors.
1661174	1667377	The DS, the DSi, the DSi XL, the 3DS, which is basically a DS anyways...
1668077	1671539	And now they're like, oh, hey, we don't really need the 3D anymore.
1672140	1673641	So it's basically a fancy DS.
1673901	1678764	Ah, they got you to buy another DS, which in turn is basically Game Boy Advance, which is a Game Boy.
1679144	1679784	I will say this.
1679904	1683046	It's not coming up in tonight's news because we had other stuff to talk about.
1683106	1688970	But there is that 3DS XL with the Legend of Zelda, the two Triforces in the top and bottom.
1689010	1690511	That 3DS XL is coming out.
1691851	1694413	It was in the leaked GameStop Black Friday ad.
1694933	1723412	I'm really hoping it is not a GameStop exclusive I don't know at this point Please don't, please don't be an exclusive Because I really want one But I won't buy it If it's a GameStop exclusive, I won't buy it But I probably will buy that Just because I'm a consumer whore Or more like I haven't been this excited for a Zelda game in a very long time Like the fact that they're making a sequel to Link to the Past I'm like, yes please, admit one please So I definitely look forward to that
1723723	1753193	however this whole fact that some of the games are really just saying ah fuck 3D that are coming from Nintendo well I guess technically Pokemon is not a first party Nintendo game but it's like a second party it's like it's first party they own the company that makes it but Pokemon company is in a really weird place because don't forget Pokemon company makes iPhone apps too which is something Nintendo refuses to do oh no I guess they're going to make Miiverse though I guess maybe that is changing their it's first party but well whatever it is it's still you know
1754847	1756188	It's still interesting.
1756568	1763573	Anyway, I'm very curious to see what's going to happen next with the DS, and I'm kind of wondering if we're going to see a new DS.
1763613	1771318	I don't know if we would see a new full DS next year, but I just feel like it wouldn't be Nintendo if we didn't get some sort of handheld next year.
1771338	1771958	You know what I mean?
1771978	1773900	We got the 2DS this year, which, you know, whatever.
1774340	1775841	I'm really curious what happens next year.
1776281	1782766	Is it going to be the 2DS and the clamshell that everybody wants, or is it going to be like 3DS XL Uber or something, you know?
1782926	1783906	I'm so curious.
1783926	1784327	Tablet.
1785528	1786648	Thanks for watching!
1804541	1812586	Or, I don't know, they'll allow you to run 3DS games on your Wii U. Because that's going to happen, eventually.
1813067	1815648	I will say it again and again, it's going to happen.
1815829	1817990	Maybe every single week, but eventually it'll happen.
1818010	1819311	I'll be like, see, I told you so!
1821152	1823273	Or it won't ever happen, and you'll just forget you ever said anything.
1824634	1826656	Alright, so yeah, Pokemon Y, I'm enjoying it.
1826796	1829718	I'm going to play a little more, way more into it than I was...
1830518	1834084	Black or Black 2 or any of the previous Pokemon games I have been playing.
1834104	1835146	So I'll let you know how that goes.
1835586	1841977	I'll let you know if I actually am able to stick with it to beat a few gym leaders or if I end up giving it up and going back to MMOs full time.
1842337	1842718	We'll see.
1843584	1849747	Alright, over at live.vognetwork.com Techness in our chatroom says, I remember playing Yellow.
1850207	1852269	It was pretty much, yay, I finally have a Pikachu.
1852449	1853349	Then it became crap.
1853389	1858212	He's useless when you hit the first gym and end up wasting time leveling up some mediocre grass type.
1858932	1869557	Yeah, kind of is the one bummer about Pokemon games sometimes is that you don't necessarily get to really play with that starter if, you know, the gym you want to fight is strong to that type.
1869577	1871038	But there's such a diversity.
1871058	1872399	You usually find something else you like.
1872919	1888349	Like, I think it's, I started with Fennekin, obviously, but then when I got that Pikachu in the first zone, I was like, hell yeah, so now I have a Pikachu, and then I like to have a Pidgey, too, because they have the air attack and all that, although he'll probably get replaced later, but for now, you know, so, anyway.
1891071	1897655	Let's see, going to the chatroom at live.vognetwork.com, Codeman suggests the Nintendo 4DS, you move with the game.
1898669	1900150	Sky, Loki, and Dark Sakura all getting the new systems.
1928772	1929392	Good question.
1929432	1930493	Are we getting the new systems?
1931673	1936115	We're likely getting a PS4, but I need a job.
1937615	1945818	I still have a PlayStation 4 on pre-order, although we're going to get into some news here very shortly that kind of makes me make a sad face when it comes to that.
1945878	1948619	I mean, I'll still get it, but yeah.
1948679	1948940	Loki?
1949220	1949780	Not at launch.
1950360	1950920	Not at launch.
1950940	1951441	I'm not getting it.
1951541	1952981	Launch, I canceled my pre-orders already.
1953801	1956843	Or pre-order, because I didn't pre-order the Xbox One.
1956923	1957183	Please.
1958652	1958992	All right.
1960073	1970137	Going to our housekeeping segment, we just want to tease that we have our Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio, and our Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR.
1970177	1972077	So please be our friend on those sites.
1972778	1979780	Also, just letting you know, and this may be news to my co-hosts too, sorry about it, but there may not be a show November 10th.
1980040	1984362	It's looking like I'm going to be out of town thanks to BlizzCon, even though I'm not going.
1984822	1985623	I am not going to BlizzCon.
1985643	1986543	You're going to DisCon?
1986883	1989304	I'm going to DizCon and I'm going to the BlizzCon parties.
1989724	1989984	Cool.
1990724	1994565	So, may not be a show November 10th unless I'm able to rush home and be here in time.
1994886	1995206	We'll see.
1996586	1999567	Just letting you know in advance, but we still have a couple weeks of show before we get there.
2000007	2005109	Alright, let's get into gaming news and Loki, some of the sad news for PlayStation 4.
2005829	2006049	Yes.
2006109	2007010	Awaiters this week, right?
2007030	2010733	Sadly, it was bound to happen, but games are being delayed.
2011654	2012935	I'm not too surprised by this.
2013115	2014857	Watch Dogs has been delayed to spring 2014.
2015958	2026146	And the reason why I'm not surprised by this is because Ubisoft has a ton of fucking titles coming out in the fourth quarter, including Assassin's Creed 4 and South Park among them.
2026567	2032652	So to have Watch Dogs coming out at the same time, I mean, Watch Dogs is almost kind of competing with Assassin's Creed 4.
2033092	2034913	So why would they want to compete with themselves?
2034973	2040818	Might as well just put out your game in a slower period of the year and polish it up even more.
2041018	2045401	Even though that does kind of suck for people that were hoping to buy that as a next-gen game.
2045881	2050324	I know when I was actually thinking about getting a PlayStation 4, that would have been one of the titles I would have probably picked up for it.
2051465	2054366	But, yeah, I guess we just got to wait.
2054746	2063810	Right now it's expected to be hitting the next financial year, which I believe they're estimating that to be second quarter of 2014.
2064971	2068392	Also, to go along with that, The Crew has been delayed to mid-2014.
2069013	2077376	And, you know, it's around the, I guess, summer period, so that runs July 2014 to September 2014.
2079917	2082618	and I'm not surprised.
2082678	2088300	I mean, I don't even think they really had a date for that other than I think it was supposed to be early 2014, so whatever.
2088320	2100264	The one that is kind of disappointing though, Sony, one of their first party launch titles has been delayed, Drive Club, which was supposed to be one of those games they actually got at least a somewhat...
2101601	2102381	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2123614	2133646	Yeah, but this is more of, I think it's more of simulation racing, so Need for Speed is definitely arcade, so they might not, it's not necessarily like Forza 5 or something.
2133746	2133946	Sure.
2133966	2136509	I mean, they had Gran Turismo 6, but that's PlayStation 3.
2136549	2136669	Right.
2144938	2150380	A lot of these games that are coming out, there's not a whole ton of exclusives for these next-gen systems at launch.
2151040	2153962	And there's still really good games coming out on current-gen.
2154002	2158623	I mean, right now, Grand Theft Auto V is not on next-gen.
2158783	2160904	Gran Turismo 6 is not on next-gen.
2160924	2167627	You know, there's plenty of games out there that they don't have next-gen versions for.
2167787	2172729	And Call of Duty, let's be honest, it's probably not going to be that much better on PlayStation 4 or Xbox One.
2173569	2175431	Aside from graphics, it'll probably look nicer.
2176051	2189942	You know, it's also interesting that big controversy a couple weeks ago when Sony delayed the PlayStation 4 in Japan to next year because they said, you know what, we're really not going to have games out available for it this holiday.
2190322	2194605	And now it's kind of looking like, yeah, maybe that is the case.
2195986	2199589	I was curious, what games are going to be out at launch?
2200229	2201810	What is going to be out on the PlayStation 4?
2202411	2203892	I have a partial list here on Wiki.
2203932	2205293	This is Wikipedia.
2205353	2206974	I have mine full list up in my head.
2206994	2207635	All right, go for it.
2207835	2212098	Okay, so as far as, and I can only really speak to North America because I have no idea.
2212119	2212559	No, that's fine.
2212579	2213359	That's what I want to know.
2213660	2216942	Okay, so first party titles are going to be coming out.
2216962	2219544	You have, of course, Killzone, Shadowfall.
2219965	2225249	You have Knack, and that's pretty much it, actually.
2225289	2226310	That is it.
2226470	2229032	Since Drive Club fell off, that's it.
2229832	2244261	Third party, you've got Call of Duty, Assassin's Creed 4, Battlefield 4, Need for Speed, NBA Live, NBA 2K14, there's also... What was the other ones here?
2244501	2247763	There was... This is something no one's going to really pick up.
2247823	2253686	Skylanders, Swap Force, LEGO Marvel Super Heroes, Angry Birds Star Wars...
2255677	2259060	The only ones I'm not hearing is Need for Speed Rivals.
2259400	2260881	I said Need for Speed Rivals.
2260981	2261441	Just Dance 2014.
2261642	2263543	Yeah, Just Dance 2014 is coming out.
2263703	2267186	And you said one of the NBA games, but there's two on the list.
2267206	2269187	Yeah, I said both.
2269468	2283799	NBA Live, which is next-gen exclusive, and NBA 2K14, which is... Now, there are some network games, too, which I know you wouldn't be as up on, but there's things like Contrast, Divekick, Minecraft, and Pinball Arcade.
2284139	2305039	Rezogun is another one those are all things that are set to be available on PlayStation Network Injustice also oh yeah that's right the Injustice Ultimate Edition yeah that's right they're getting a PlayStation 4 version but that's that's that and Injustice to be honest Injustice at least the next gen version is exclusive to the PlayStation 4 so they do have that I guess um
2306139	2311302	I was going to say also, Xbox One, they still have a decent lineup.
2311342	2312782	They've got all three of their games.
2312862	2325248	I was just going to say, Xbox One, as much as they've been getting the short end of the stick with their popularity on the internet, some things they do have that they're going to have on the 22nd, they will have Crimson Dragon.
2325928	2353326	Dead Rising 3, Forza Motorsport 5, Killer Instinct Although I gotta be honest, I don't care about Killer Instinct anymore Rise, and let's see, Power Star Golf It says it's exclusive, so the Xbox Fitness game as well There's also the Zumba Fitness game And yeah, and then a lot of those same third-party games we'd already mentioned before So, I mean, Xbox, it's funny, it really does have more exclusives
2354506	2358948	But it's going to be interesting to see, are people going to pay the other $100 to get in on that?
2360609	2363230	And are the exclusives good enough?
2364110	2372033	I'm going to be honest, when I look at this list, I go Rise, eh, Killer Instinct, maybe, but I don't like what I'm hearing about it.
2372413	2374814	Crimson Dragon, okay, yeah, I'd like to check that one out.
2375540	2376761	But would that sell you a system?
2377182	2377602	Probably not.
2377622	2378463	I don't think so, no.
2379404	2383447	Like, had it been a new Halo game, that might have tipped the scales.
2383968	2386510	Had it been that Quantum Break, that definitely would have tipped the scales.
2387411	2392556	So, you know, honestly, it comes down to the third-party games for me.
2393036	2395479	I think I would like to play Need for Speed, for sure.
2396119	2399242	I'd like to check out the LEGO game, because usually those are pretty good.
2399863	2399983	And...
2401164	2406107	But the LEGO game, I mean, if you really want to, it's coming out on the Wii U about a month before that it comes out on the other systems.
2406147	2409489	So it's not really a game that needs an X-Gen version of.
2409870	2413532	And Skylanders, please, that's not a game that needs an X-Gen version of.
2413692	2415854	I mean, seriously, that's going to be a port...
2416514	2418555	and Angry Birds Star Wars.
2418815	2419155	Really?
2419515	2419855	Really?
2419996	2420556	No one cared.
2421176	2421556	Seriously.
2422937	2427259	So, yeah, that's kind of where I was even when they had their full lineups.
2427279	2430980	Like, well, there's not really a lot that's selling me on these next gen systems.
2431000	2436703	Like, the only first party game that looked really good to me for PlayStation 4 was Infamous Second Son.
2436743	2438423	That was like, oh, hey, that looks kind of cool.
2438463	2442085	You know, Killzone, I'm just not a fan of Killzone.
2442305	2444406	If it was a new Resistance game that looked that nice...
2445126	2446627	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2467402	2489937	and the PlayStation 3 has just gotten a little bit more activity now that I'm playing Grand Theft Auto on both systems but it was pretty much collecting dust and the Xbox 360 was the only thing I was playing on and a lot of people now are upgrading to the Xbox One because they figure well I've invested all this time in the Xbox 360 I might as well go along with that you know to carry over my gamer score which really doesn't mean anything folks just saying and
2490517	2491457	I got over that.
2491538	2493958	Wouldn't your trophy information on PlayStation carry over too?
2493998	2495279	Yeah, that's going to carry over too.
2495319	2496499	I'm talking about 360.
2498740	2500181	That doesn't really count for anything.
2501921	2504362	I can't do that anymore.
2504762	2512405	Even when I do go to buy a system, I'm not going to buy all of the different systems out there just because I don't have time to play all of them.
2512805	2516646	Honestly, I don't want to waste money on more than one system.
2517487	2517607	So...
2518627	2529626	I'll just wait and see and I'm sure price drops will happen or at least there'll be more games out there in some time so might as well wait for something that I really want to play like an action version of Grand Theft Auto 5.
2532293	2533053	Alright, we'll see.
2534134	2543899	Anyhow, yeah, I'm curious to see how that all pans out this holiday season, like what games end up being the big seller this holiday.
2544760	2551103	Because I gotta say, it's really funny, the games I'm looking forward to the most are on Wii U.
2552552	2553413	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
2568636	2569937	So, anyway.
2570537	2571278	Alright, let's move on.
2571558	2578022	Speaking of Xbox One, Xbox One not going to be doing any type of real name integration at launch.
2578322	2580543	You're still going to be using your gamer tags at launch.
2580843	2582664	Now, don't mishear me here.
2582684	2588328	I'm not saying that Xbox was going to plan to switch everybody to their real names, although that would be hilarious for the trolls.
2588728	2590369	But you know I'm not here for that either.
2590909	2593711	I threw a fit when Blizzard threatened to do it with real ID.
2593891	2595173	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2610331	2613332	The game tags are all you're going to have on Xbox One.
2613992	2618973	They did say, quote, Our teams are working hard to deliver a quality experience for Xbox One.
2619373	2624834	This means prioritizing some features and sometimes postponing others for a later update.
2625674	2629095	Honestly, I don't miss the fact that they're not going to use my real name.
2629675	2630215	Who cares?
2630235	2631995	It's not something I really want them to use.
2632295	2634376	Did Xbox say it's coming off of Facebook?
2634436	2636936	Because if they get that from my credit card, I will not be happy.
2638519	2644683	I would imagine it would have to come from Facebook because they have alternate payment forms now.
2644743	2646124	It's not all just through a credit card.
2646504	2647025	I guess that's true.
2648526	2654250	But just so you know, the real names are how people are supposed to be able to search for you, like if they want to be able to find you or whatever.
2654270	2657071	But then I would think, well, what kind of privacy restrictions are they going to put in place?
2657492	2659773	I kind of don't want people to search for my name and find me.
2660474	2666177	Sorry, if I want you to find me, I'll give you my gamer tag, which any listener of this show that's ever asked for it, I've given it to them.
2666338	2668419	Honestly, there's a lot of people that share my name, so it doesn't matter.
2668639	2668859	Or... Or...
2691716	2707544	or having the maybe keeping the name secret but having it for issues of just searching if you know who you're looking for yeah that might be something different however I I don't know but yeah I gotta be honest if I want you to find me I'll give you my gamer tag
2708004	2708564	Exactly.
2709204	2712345	I don't need you to be able to just search for my name or whatever.
2712385	2725288	I think what they're trying to do is they're trying to integrate it with Facebook even tighter so that way, you know, once it gets you to connect it one time, it's going to be like, look at all these people you don't have on your Xbox friends list yet, but you're friends with them on Facebook.
2725428	2726128	Add, add, add, add.
2726148	2734670	Don't you want to add them now so you can send them cookies and fight with them on Killer Instinct and all this stuff?
2734690	2735730	I don't know.
2737170	2765396	so going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com Ragenator says Sky why associate a credit card number with a system when there's those PSN Wii Xbox Live funds cards that are everywhere because it's an extra step no that's a good point and I try not to give them that information anymore but I think they have it on file because my Xbox Gold still comes from that and historically they would have had that information anyway so there you go
2766596	2794813	STJ100 Matt in chat says I don't really want people to know my real name here sure I want to play with people but I don't really want people to know my real name yeah I'm kind of with you and if these systems are going to reveal either one of them if it's unveiled that they're going to show the real names or whatever I'm out I'm not buying the system if that crap is in there yes I do want anonymity but it's not to troll people it's because I play video games to escape the real world sometimes so just saying
2796127	2796407	DarkSakura
2822170	2841505	Well, for something that is not complain-worthy, something that's actually good, is that Squeenix said that Kingdom Hearts 2.5 Remix is a HD compilation that has the Kingdom Hearts 2 final mix, Birth by Sleep final mix, and the remastered cinematics from ReCoded.
2842526	2849614	and it's going to be on PS3 and is going to be out in 2014 but no mention of PS4.
2850816	2854100	So this will be coming after the 1.5 remix.
2855241	2855661	So yay.
2856502	2858785	More HD Kingdom farts.
2861928	2865570	I saw that new trailer though for Kingdom Hearts 3.
2866791	2867532	Sexy.
2868212	2868732	Sexy.
2869233	2870494	What did I say on my friend's Facebook?
2870514	2874376	I think I said this is serving up some big Thunder Mountain electric parade realness.
2875697	2878699	Now I did watch it and I was just like this looks like more Kingdom Hearts.
2879300	2881161	I think it wasn't really big Thunder Mountain at all.
2881201	2883623	I think that train was part of the electric parade.
2884153	2888217	Yeah, and the stage name was in the corner, and it didn't say Big Thunder Mountain.
2888918	2890840	Granted, they might call it something different in Japan.
2890880	2891280	I don't know.
2891881	2902391	But it was interesting that anything they did show did not incorporate any other Disney properties besides the goofy and Donald sidekicks that you expect to see.
2902411	2908517	Because you saw Traverse Town, and then you saw a big pirate ship that was flipping around in circles.
2909037	2937730	and then you didn't really like you didn't see you know Mulan World and you didn't see Tron and you didn't see you know 100 Acre Wood you didn't see any of that stuff so we still don't know exactly what's going to be represented in the game but I figure they want to keep most of that a secret for a good long while well and it also if I'm right at the two Disney parks in Japan I think that there's not a big Thunder I think that they've combined that concept with the Indiana Jones ride to have an outdoor roller coaster oh okay that sometimes runs backwards yeah
2938769	2944832	And wouldn't that be fascinating if they had an Indiana Jones level or something that incorporates the LucasArts?
2945052	2945973	They technically can.
2946053	2947794	They can, but... Marvel?
2948054	2948814	I wonder if they will.
2949415	2951616	I mean, that's a little bit more separate, but Marvel.
2951656	2955938	I think they're going to keep it Disney to Squeenix and leave it there.
2956118	2962562	I think they will too, but I could see a very subtle, like, here comes Indiana Jones.
2962622	2964203	I could see that being a thing.
2964443	2968085	Just a little bit of a wink and a nod to some of their recent acquisitions.
2968485	2970507	I think putting Marvel in there would be too much.
2970887	2972788	That's like a completely different universe.
2972808	2973789	What about Pixar stuff?
2974790	2975650	I really hope they do.
2976631	2978873	I think some of the Pixar games would make for great levels.
2980434	2983636	Especially with how they've been pushing the Cars franchise.
2983816	2985938	Yeah, Cars Land and all that has been huge.
2985958	2988860	For a very short ride.
2989801	2990241	Oh my god.
2991595	2994497	I would love to do something in the Wall-E universe.
2994777	2999739	Wall-E is kind of set on Earth, so I don't know exactly what they would do with that, but we'll see.
2999939	3000479	Incredibles?
3000499	3001900	That'd be cool.
3002260	3008242	But yeah, a lot of the Pixar stories are sort of like, they're not really about their worlds so much as they are the characters, I think.
3008422	3011243	Star Wars would be cool, though.
3011283	3012404	Yeah, Star Wars would be very cool.
3013744	3015905	DarkSakura, did you see the other news about Kingdom Hearts 3?
3017286	3019687	Um, I let me, uh, no.
3020047	3020187	Sorry.
3021433	3023615	Because my iPad's being a shit again.
3024196	3024516	Hold on.
3025197	3025537	You know what?
3025657	3041151	I do believe that there is a little bit more news and of course it is something that we're pretty aware was going to happen regardless is that Utada Hikaru may return for Kingdom Hearts 3 which I think is probably going to happen.
3041593	3042693	She really should, I mean.
3043113	3045254	But she's been on a musical hiatus or something, right?
3045474	3047154	Didn't she take a break or something?
3047494	3063737	She did, but there was actually a post that came from Utada Teruzane, who is her dad, who said that the two of them were undecided when it came to Kingdom Hearts 3.
3065417	3068978	So she's not contributing a new theme song, but there's a chance she might help.
3070137	3072438	I sure hope she does do something with it.
3072518	3073038	It'd be great.
3073058	3078080	Because the songs, especially Simple and Clean, was so important to Kingdom Hearts, you know?
3078420	3079701	Yeah.
3079761	3083202	Codeman in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, Wreck-It Ralph World?
3083602	3084403	That would be too meta.
3084583	3085223	That's too meta.
3085563	3087824	Although, Sugar Rush would be pretty great.
3088325	3089586	I could still see them doing that.
3089626	3090186	That would be pretty cool.
3090206	3093648	Like a Sugar Rush level would be kind of, like just even like instead of the gummy ship.
3095490	3096991	Tangled, I could see Tangled.
3097351	3098852	Oh, I could totally see Tangled.
3098992	3099953	I kind of hope they do that.
3099973	3101073	That would be great.
3101093	3102054	You know which one?
3102094	3102854	The festival lights.
3102874	3103735	Now, have they done this yet?
3103775	3104936	Because I liked it.
3104996	3105816	I thought it was a good movie.
3105896	3106757	Emperor's New Groove.
3107546	3108526	I don't know if they ever did.
3108646	3110147	Unless they did it in one of the handheld games.
3110187	3110827	I don't think they did.
3113288	3113669	Let's see.
3114149	3118671	SSJ100Matt says, Indiana Jones in Kingdom Hearts would be better than the Crystal Skull.
3119191	3120011	Oh, ain't that the truth.
3121032	3122332	I have bars low.
3122852	3125093	Shia LaBeouf is not allowed to be in Kingdom Hearts.
3125814	3128695	Do not let that kid anywhere near Kingdom Hearts.
3129876	3133238	You keep Shia LaBeouf away from Kingdom Hearts.
3134019	3134800	Not gonna happen.
3135480	3137182	Ooh, Actdeft is suggesting Brave.
3137382	3138943	That would be a great Pixar movie.
3139424	3140204	I can see that, yeah.
3140244	3141866	I can totally see that as well.
3141886	3142766	That would be great.
3143127	3151974	Alright, anyhow, we could fan-wank Kingdom Hearts worlds all day long, but the reality is we are just not gonna know until they make some formal announcements, so we'll see what happens.
3152334	3152575	Loki!
3153275	3156878	Alright, so some other good news for the Xbox One platform.
3157519	3178697	They are making available to all the developers the Xbox Live Compute, I don't know if you would call it, I guess, SDK, which is basically the ability to use the cloud servers for off-platform computations, including physics, and more importantly, dedicated servers.
3179298	3180479	And so because of that,
3181279	3196405	Dedicated servers for all multiplayer games is possible, but it has to be enabled by the developers because they can also choose to have control over that versus using the Xbox Live Compute stuff.
3197306	3206110	And I guess they're saying that they have over 300,000 virtual servers powered by cloud technology.
3206190	3206370	So...
3207410	3216394	Sounds like they could get some... I mean, that's definitely a plus for a lot of people that play multiplayer, especially like Call of Duty and stuff, that you're going to have dedicated servers.
3216594	3225678	And also kind of curbs cheating a bit, because there's people that hack the platforms and stuff, and having a dedicated server would kind of eliminate that.
3227219	3227959	Sounds ambitious.
3229400	3231381	And entirely a good idea.
3231401	3231481	Yeah.
3232361	3233923	I'm just curious to see how stable that all is.
3244697	3251081	Every company comes out and says, Hey, yeah, we've seen these problems with connectivity and stuff like that.
3251221	3253323	It's not going to happen to us.
3253363	3254463	We're prepared this time.
3255104	3258106	And every time, it's fucked up.
3259466	3265550	I'm kind of curious to see how all these servers are going to play into that, or if it's just going to be a big fucking mess.
3265630	3265970	Because...
3267431	3273893	I wouldn't be surprised if it was a big fucking mess just because all the other, you know, online games and stuff have just been mess.
3274533	3283636	What will be the first Xbox game to get that error 37 equivalent or the SimCity connection error and all these hilarities in the past?
3283676	3285457	The one that I could see would be the biggest...
3286317	3295881	Paying the ass would maybe be fours of five, because remember you have to download part of the game, or most of the game, because it's not done yet on the disc.
3297162	3300283	I can see that being a problem if you can't connect to their cloud servers.
3302024	3306366	Also, the other thing, remember, just like Rockstar just had the problem where it wasn't necessarily...
3306946	3310708	All of the cloud service, but mainly the matchmaking stuff was down.
3311128	3316471	And so even if you have a part of your service down, that could still affect everything.
3317131	3318472	So I don't know.
3320433	3321273	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3342384	3348887	It makes me think that there's a little bit more hype to it than is actually going to be reality.
3348947	3351568	So I guess we'll have to see when it launches.
3351628	3354309	I'm sure we'll be talking about stories of connectivity.
3354429	3358631	I'm not saying it's probably limited to Microsoft at all.
3359451	3363333	If the PlayStation 4 relies heavily on cloud servers, then yeah, it's probably going to be everybody.
3363922	3364222	Cyan Inc.
3364242	3365023	Cyan Inc.
3390621	3393003	Well, they have announced that they are making a new game.
3393323	3394605	It's called Abduction.
3395025	3395986	Not Abduction.
3396246	3398408	It's O-B-D-U-C-T-I-O-N.
3398708	3400409	Abduction is the new game.
3400690	3401650	But here's the interesting thing.
3401991	3403132	It is a Kickstarter game.
3403192	3405193	This is where they're taking their case to Kickstarter.
3405454	3410017	And they're trying to get $1.1 million to make this game work.
3410478	3415202	They're talking about very similar exploration-driven gameplay that helped make Myst a reality.
3416723	3418364	They're going to do Unreal Engine 4.
3419205	3421406	is what they want to be able to license to make this game work.
3421927	3424108	And they're targeting mid to late 2015.
3424789	3429071	So they're giving themselves plenty of time to make abduction happen.
3429732	3431853	So if you want to check that out, you can go to their Kickstarter.
3432253	3438497	Now, the thing that really got me about this though is I'm like, dude, this is the studio that made Myst and Riven.
3438677	3441039	Like, why do they have to turn to Kickstarter?
3441219	3445301	Like, surely there's a publisher or somebody out there that's willing to back them a little bit.
3445601	3447683	So I was kind of like, well, what the hell else have they done?
3448323	3450064	Outside of Riven and Myst.
3450104	3453266	Anybody know, without cheating, what some of the other games Cyan Inc.
3453326	3454847	did in the downtime?
3455328	3461011	Because once I went to go look at the list, I was like, oh yeah, there was that game that really didn't do well.
3461271	3468336	It was the one that was that Myst, not Myst Online or whatever the hell they ended up calling it, that was part of, wasn't GameTap actually?
3468396	3470537	It was Myst Online, Uru Live.
3470697	3472238	You're right, that's it.
3472338	3473199	It went over to GameTap.
3473219	3474900	There were a lot of Uru games actually.
3474980	3476501	Uru, I think, was the third Myst game.
3476721	3504141	and then they did all these different Uru games that Ubisoft was doing for a while including Myst 5, went all the way there and then Myst Online, yeah I remember that game kind of flopped and GameTap picked it up and ran it for a little while I actually played Myst Online, the funny thing is back in 2007 this show was around and I think there's some old episodes where I was talking about my experiences in Myst Online it was just such an odd game, like I don't mean that in a bad way, it was just like, it was so like just
3504501	3510425	It's kind of creepy, odd, like the ambience in that game was really like chills.
3510505	3522593	But I mean, I enjoyed what I did play of it, even though it wasn't as obvious of a game as World of Warcraft or even EverQuest where it's like experience leads to levels, leads to abilities, leads to gold, gold, gold.
3522853	3525715	You know, Uru Online was a very different type of game.
3526435	3527656	Other than that, that was 2007.
3528017	3532640	And since then, it's been a lot of iPhone, iPod, iPad type of stuff.
3533400	3534481	They adapted Myst.
3534841	3535922	They adapted Riven.
3536222	3539184	They did some games called Bug Chucker and Stone Ship.
3539504	3543067	So Abduction is a very kind of anxious...
3544047	3546569	Return to form, shall we say, for this company.
3547049	3548310	And best of luck to them.
3548610	3549851	They just might do it.
3549871	3551812	They got a $1.1 million goal.
3552132	3554574	They have raised just shy of half a million.
3554594	3557816	They're at $460,000 with 26 days to go.
3558516	3563740	So they've already made between a third and a half of the money with only four days down.
3564500	3566561	So that's pretty cool.
3566581	3570864	$25 or more will get you the game via Kickstarter, by the way.
3571185	3572405	$45 is a digital collection.
3572706	3575047	Let's see some of the crazy rewards they're giving.
3575207	3580631	$10,000 or more will give you an experience design at Cyan.
3580651	3584313	You can actually go to an early abduction design meeting.
3584894	3587476	You can either go there or join via Skype.
3588056	3590077	And I guess you get to have your say in the game.
3590678	3591058	Kind of neat.
3592697	3593197	So there you go.
3593578	3601842	And they're already looking at stretch goals too, but they won't say what they are until they reach the base funding, which I imagine would just be more expansions of the game and so on and so on.
3602423	3608226	So going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com, SSJ100Matt says, Mist was odd.
3608326	3609167	I should go back to it.
3609467	3611708	I still have the original CD-ROM copy laying around.
3613069	3617272	Ragenator says, The Riven original soundtrack is great to play if you're having trouble sleeping.
3618012	3625108	Dungeon Buster says Cyan went the way that a lot of adventure games did in the 90s, which is probably why they're kickstarting this project.
3625448	3628655	Tim Schafer had to kickstart his own adventure game just to get it going.
3629164	3651054	well it's so interesting because a lot of these projects end up being very successful so it's surprising to me and especially with how well The Walking Dead did last year and was so well received and everything I'm like I'm really surprised that the mainstream is not getting like dude people never really got over the 90s adventure game thing like there's still very much an audience for that you know
3653681	3659586	Anyhow, Ragenator says, SSJ100, Matt, is that even playable on modern PCs?
3659846	3666612	Well, they had it in GameTap, and even though GameTap is a few years old at this point, you definitely could play all those games.
3667353	3669655	I'm sure it's got to be on good old games, right?
3669695	3670856	Myst has to be there.
3670956	3672197	It's got to be.
3672858	3673498	All right, there you go.
3673538	3676000	So good luck to the studio getting that going.
3676141	3677502	It'll be exciting if they get it done.
3678423	3680264	I hope it's as creepy as other games.
3680845	3681205	DarkSakura.
3682034	3684497	Well, Rob, this actually may affect you.
3684838	3685759	May or may not affect you.
3686941	3689084	And 50,000 other people that I know fucking play this game.
3689124	3690025	Do I have to go get a shot?
3690313	3691234	No, no, no.
3691394	3692214	But there is a bug.
3693015	3695517	However, it's not a sickness bug.
3695577	3699700	It's a sickness within Pokemon X and Y. Also the entire game.
3700360	3701021	Yeah, the whole game.
3701181	3701341	No.
3702041	3714770	Basically, if you save your game in Lumio City, there is a problem where if you save in and around the streets outside the city, the game will lock up and make you have to reset your game.
3715151	3718493	And when you reboot, the game will load the save and freeze again.
3718513	3719814	Basically, it loops and loops and loops.
3720415	3729277	Now, Nintendo is aware of this and they're working on making a patch for it that will be downloaded when they have it done.
3730882	3732703	So at least they know about it.
3732803	3734163	At least something's going to happen.
3734763	3736824	It just hasn't happened quite yet.
3737064	3739185	And, you know, they're saying they've put out a map.
3739265	3746347	It's only a Japanese one, which I will go ahead and also link to the chat room, assuming it loads.
3747027	3753989	But for those of you who are affected by this, sorry, start over and don't save in the town.
3756536	3761743	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase rainbow.
3770201	3772542	Yeah, I'm going to make a note of that, so I don't do that.
3772622	3776003	But I do like how in the new Pokemon games you can practically save anywhere.
3776783	3777464	So that's pretty cool.
3777784	3778104	Useful.
3778824	3779424	Much useful.
3779764	3781805	Better than trying to find a save point and do it that way.
3782085	3782545	That's for sure.
3782985	3783225	All right.
3783966	3790228	Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates of some games coming out soon that hopefully aren't broken, that have hopefully been quality tested.
3790908	3797450	Which is, by the way, not to get all like tangenty or whatever, but that's the good thing about those other games you were talking about earlier getting delayed.
3797830	3801531	Like things like, you know, Drive Club and Watch Dogs and everything.
3802011	3802431	You know what?
3802971	3808233	If they have to do that to QA the games and make sure that they're going to be right, then fine.
3808413	3808913	Delay them.
3809013	3810513	We'll never remember that they were delayed.
3810673	3812274	Wasn't Grand Theft Auto V delayed a bunch?
3812394	3812654	Yes.
3812774	3813574	We all forgave them.
3814114	3814934	We forgive them, right?
3815334	3816155	And it was worth it.
3816215	3816555	That's right.
3816595	3817115	It was worth it.
3817615	3819196	So, you know what?
3819316	3822758	I would rather the games get delayed to test the QA.
3823039	3824940	Now, in this Pokemon, I don't know.
3824980	3830523	I mean, like, because you can save anywhere, like, I don't know if they would have found that during QA testing or whatever.
3830884	3832765	That would be a very tricky thing to find.
3832965	3833385	It would be.
3833445	3840650	So, I mean, I forgive them, but Nintendo's got to be able to patch these things faster and more efficiently, too, I think in some ways.
3841010	3869596	you know what I mean like you kind of expect on Xbox and Playstation it's always going to patch right away if they have them Nintendo can kind of be a pain in the butt they haven't quite figured out this whole internet thing yet yeah that's and I think that's part of what's their worst nightmare right now with Wii U I'm still convinced that plays into it I mean my friends have made good arguments about to the contrary and about how you know there is DLC for like Assassin's Creed now they just started that a year ago but see there's something about all of that
3870596	3886295	and the fact that nothing ever showed up for Mass Effect 3 nothing showed up for Injustice and all that just kind of nothing showing up for Assassin's Creed 4 there's something really weird about that I mean granted Nintendo's doing it themselves now with Super Luigi and all this other stuff but are they doing it differently than it was done on 360?
3886575	3887937	I don't know so
3889764	3892125	and EA Uplay has a channel on Wii U though
3918619	3920440	Oh, well then I don't know.
3921040	3921860	Maybe they changed something.
3922760	3923140	I don't know.
3923240	3925721	Or maybe it's trickier on Nintendo or something.
3925741	3925981	I don't know.
3926001	3928962	Anyway, Tangent Train, Choo Choo, let's go to release dates.
3929302	3931402	So this week we actually have quite a few things coming out.
3931803	3938844	Starting off with Naruto Shippuden, Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 Full Burst, which is a re-release of the game with DLC, PS3, and 360.
3939405	3947627	For that, Deus Ex Human Revolution The Director's Cut coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and debuting on the Wii U.
3948968	3951651	Um, and of course those are re-released for, you know, the other two platforms.
3952212	3960962	Uh, Spongebob, Plankton's Robotic Revenge on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, Wii U, 3DS, and DS.
3961603	3965067	Uh, Hometown Story, if you're a fan of the Harvest Moon games, it is
3965847	3966928	Sort of a spin-off of that.
3967729	3968970	That's on 3DS this week.
3969250	3979378	LEGO Marvel Super Heroes on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii U, 3DS, and Vita and PC.
3980479	3982321	The Sims 3 Into the Future.
3983322	3985163	That's a new expansion.
3985403	3986484	That's on PC, of course.
3988146	3988286	Um...
3989967	3990707	Let's see.
3990988	3996390	Also, Disney Infinity, some more of the packs are coming out.
3996450	4000032	Toy Story, as well as the Woody figure.
4000312	4004174	And I believe next, not next week, but the week after next is Jack Skellington.
4004194	4006135	I was going to say, where the hell is Nightmare Before Christmas?
4006195	4007015	It's that time of year, right?
4007035	4010056	Well, it's been a GameStop exclusive for right now.
4011277	4012157	Exclusive on the figurine.
4012177	4015759	And Woody, I think, is exclusive to Walmart or Target or Toys R Us, one of those stores.
4015899	4018320	I got an exclusive finger for GameStop right here.
4019721	4021342	Sorry to the employees.
4021482	4023843	My anger is not with you, the front-end associates.
4024964	4043033	If you want to get some 2K games that have been out before, there are some collections coming out, including the 2K Essentials collection, which is, I believe, Bioshock, Borderlands, and I want to say... Oh, what the hell was the last game there?
4043053	4043313	I can't...
4043533	4047256	XCOM, the first XCOM game that was on 360.
4048117	4050879	Not really the first XCOM game.
4050959	4051260	On 360.
4051800	4052841	You'd be going back to the 90s.
4052861	4054462	No, I said the first XCOM game on 360.
4054963	4055783	Okay, okay.
4055803	4056444	In PS3.
4056464	4059727	That's on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
4059767	4068134	They also have another collection, the Strategy Collection, which is Civ V and XCOM.
4068294	4068894	That's on PC.
4070576	4075281	and then there's another one with, I don't remember, I'll get to that in just a second here.
4075501	4080366	Let's see, Rocksmith 2014 edition coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and PC.
4080726	4089856	Of course, they also have a version without the little adapter in case you bought the game before and a version with a guitar because, you know, you need a guitar for that game.
4091056	4094777	Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles on 3DS, Wii, and Xbox 360.
4095237	4099179	And that's based on the new cartoon series on Nickelodeon.
4099839	4104040	Just Dance Kids 2014 on Wii and Wii U and Xbox 360.
4104080	4105700	Oh, God, there's a kids game this year, too?
4106101	4107781	There's been a kids game for the last few years.
4108221	4109541	I knew there was the one.
4109782	4112002	There's four kids games last year.
4112322	4115583	God, does it have that horrible... God, that joke.
4115743	4118404	No, the... What does the fox say about...
4120525	4121686	I don't know, but that would be pretty funny.
4121826	4123928	Oh my god, that song gets on my nerves so bad.
4123988	4127550	I've finally, by the way, seen that, and I was sorry I saw that.
4127570	4131312	They play it on the radio now, and I'm like, okay, that was funny for a day.
4131512	4131933	Stop.
4132653	4134114	I'm so glad I don't listen to the radio.
4134915	4137096	It made me laugh the first time, and after that I was like, yeah.
4137276	4140719	And my wife has told me, and I also saw this, but I actually haven't listened to this song yet.
4140739	4142240	Well, apparently it's a huge kids song.
4142780	4143441	It's a kids thing.
4143641	4144602	The What Does the Fox Say.
4145562	4148725	I thought it was a stoner song because it was a bunch of stoners jumping around.
4149586	4150947	What does the bong say?
4152731	4155292	What about that Chinese food song?
4156072	4157713	Now that, I'm here for that.
4158213	4162555	That song cracked my ass up and the video is fantastic.
4162615	4164355	I hated myself for finding it funny.
4164595	4165916	I have not seen that song yet.
4166036	4168557	Oh no, the Chinese food, that's great.
4168577	4172138	Just seeing that guy take the panda thing off, I'm like, it's that dude!
4172398	4200720	it's the little things too the like little subtly horribly racist things in the video like when they're talking like they're playing Monopoly like he rhymes some freaking Chinese who a Monopoly and then he moves the piece to Oriental Avenue in the video it's like they're going for every it's like they're going for every fucking stereotype in the universe oh but I I love its badness but then again like Showgirls is my favorite movie so it's sort of like I don't know if it's trying to be Lisa Lampanelli style funny but
4201741	4202221	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4229001	4242110	and then Wii Party U for the Wii U. This game was so great looking that they also had to throw a remote in there and a horizontal stand for your... What games are in Wii Party U?
4242490	4243651	I know nothing about this game.
4243991	4244591	It's crap.
4244752	4246092	Okay, We Party was terrible.
4246252	4247053	It's gonna be crap.
4247093	4249494	In Soviet Russia, We Party You!
4250495	4252156	Just what the name makes me think.
4252536	4252716	I'm sorry.
4253096	4254297	Some other random games coming out.
4254357	4260721	Cradle of Egypt 2, which is a puzzle game, and Girls Fashion Shoot, which is a fashion simulator game.
4260921	4261481	That's it.
4262021	4262662	That is it.
4262822	4263782	That would be everything.
4264263	4264743	Oh, yay.
4265063	4270026	Although, I do have to say this week, though, I believe is also the DLC for Saints Row 4.
4270567	4273549	So, there's some DLC coming out for that.
4273949	4276531	The Enter the Dominatrix stuff.
4276991	4277311	Alright.
4277852	4281874	Now's the part of the show where you get to hear me horribly butcher Japanese release dates.
4281954	4282395	Yay!
4282835	4293542	On the PlayStation 3 in Japan on October 24th, BlazBlue Chrono Phantasma comes out, as well as GQ Powerful Pro Yaku 2013, which is that soccer?
4293602	4294082	It's baseball.
4294283	4294763	Baseball.
4295904	4296845	Tears to Tiara 2, Hau no Matsue
4314783	4319087	That's, I don't know, but it looks like some type of role-playing-esque game.
4320388	4321289	I don't know what this is.
4321809	4323831	This is like half the other things I see come out.
4324752	4325392	Let's see what else there is.
4325472	4339063	Root Double Before Crime, After Days Extended Edition, and Kazuko Kyaku Tomogu Ito in Regular and Limited Edition from Cyberfront this week, which looks like... Okay, I'm looking at a screenshot from this game.
4339083	4339163	Okay.
4340279	4343422	And I'm sorry, but those breasts are like too much.
4343803	4345004	For that face.
4345324	4352011	Yeah, for that cute little chibi face, she's got these breasts like she would be tipping forward.
4352031	4352812	She is tipping forward.
4352832	4358598	However, I can say I was quite young and quite stacked.
4359059	4359379	Yeah?
4359639	4360360	So it is possible.
4360380	4361421	Were you that stacked?
4361441	4362622	Because that's a bit much.
4363362	4364182	I'm gonna put it this way.
4364443	4365703	I've been a D since I was 13.
4366184	4366744	You're blessed.
4367044	4367544	It's fine.
4367564	4368065	You're blessed.
4368985	4369725	Nothing wrong with that.
4371746	4372167	Boys like that.
4372187	4372767	Some girls too.
4373047	4375508	Oh, if they don't show the boy's face, then it's a date rape game.
4377089	4381452	I don't know about this, because the guy is... This is a little bit of an awkward picture.
4381552	4384293	That's a fucking game.
4384393	4385814	That may not look consensual.
4385834	4386894	So, the quote South Park.
4387375	4387695	Nice.
4388455	4389536	It's not okay.
4390277	4392538	It's essentially a Moi game.
4394100	4395541	Which Alan just said in chat.
4395561	4396201	Yep.
4396622	4399604	Alright, going to the Xbox 360 this week in Japan.
4400124	4400464	Nada.
4400705	4400965	Nuttin.
4401225	4401525	Zero.
4401705	4402006	Zilch.
4402646	4408871	On the PlayStation 3, though, that same baseball game, GQL Powerful Pro Yaku 2013 from Konami.
4408991	4411273	That's an ongoing series, too.
4411613	4416897	On the Wii U this week in Japan, Sonic Lost World, which I think came out here this week, right?
4417307	4418087	Sonic Lost?
4418248	4420969	Meh.
4422150	4432955	On the Nintendo 3DS, a bunch of Sonic stuff, including the Sonic Lost World port over there, but also some little headphones and cute little stickers and all that shit on the 3DS.
4434076	4435817	And lastly, the PSP.
4435897	4440219	Still getting a lot of stuff right now, including that same baseball game from Konami.
4440859	4443561	Diabolik Lovers More Blood.
4444361	4445541	Yes, that is the name of the game.
4445861	4449762	Diablo Lick, Lovers, More, Blood.
4451863	4456324	And it does kind of look like, oh God, it looks like Twilight as an anime video game.
4456444	4457585	It's a visual novel.
4457625	4457725	Nope.
4457745	4459485	They're getting a ton of visual novel games.
4459545	4459925	Nope.
4462446	4463466	Nope to that one.
4463626	4464626	Nope, N-O-P-E.
4464766	4466327	All right, DarkSakura, how about the UK?
4467475	4468335	There's a few things.
4468915	4486060	On the 21st, which is already the 21st there as of right now, Eldritch on PC and Warfare on PC, on the 23rd, Alien Rage for PS3, the 24th, Dream Chamber, Just Dance Kids 2014, and Ace Attorney 5 for the 3DS.
4486800	4489241	On the 25th, God, tons of stuff.
4490402	4498189	Batman Arkham Origins, Blackgate, Naruto Shippuden, Ultimate Ninja Storm 3, Full Burst, Rise of Venice, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and We Party U.
4510788	4511028	DarkSakura,
4528099	4533205	Okay, like, I would be with you there, but remember, Wii Sports, biggest game ever.
4534167	4534427	Ever.
4534827	4535248	No, no, no.
4535608	4537531	I have no problem with the Wii Sports.
4537651	4538251	That's fine.
4538832	4542056	I'm talking about having the U at the end.
4542096	4544319	Like, do we really need new Super Mario Bros.
4544579	4544679	U?
4545280	4546181	Or, you know...
4547382	4567744	anything anything kind of just what they do though the only system that didn't really do that was the GameCube I mean even with the Super Nintendo it was super everything Super Adventure Island and Super Star Wars and super you know it was super they were so much better than their previous versions I mean come on there wasn't really anything that was super that wasn't that was a pretty awesome that was a pretty super system
4568284	4570006	You're going from 8-bit to 16-bit.
4570087	4571228	Everything looked pretty super.
4571328	4572169	Thank you, Actdeft.
4572189	4573351	And the chatroom says blank 64.
4574292	4576414	Everything was blank 64 on the N64.
4576454	4576935	Superman 64.
4578136	4578977	Mario Kart 64.
4579598	4580459	Mario 64.
4581320	4582341	This is just what Nintendo does.
4582482	4583543	They beat that name into you.
4584366	4585307	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4606139	4609023	Actdeft says super all the things
4624583	4626943	It's like it's pumpkin or something right now.
4627023	4627624	So there you go.
4628264	4629384	Live.VogNetwork.com.
4630384	4631364	Let's get into some stories.
4631664	4631924	Loki.
4632724	4633064	All right.
4633525	4636865	So let's talk a little bit about games with gold.
4636885	4639566	And this was something that I was kind of meh.
4639746	4641366	I mean, it's only two games a month and stuff.
4641386	4650928	And I know a lot of direct comparisons with PlayStation Plus, which, by the way, folks, if you haven't jumped on this yet, Shadow of the Colossus is available on PlayStation Plus.
4652008	4652748	I need to jump on that.
4652808	4653348	As is Ico.
4653988	4655909	Yes, I echo as last month.
4656530	4658851	I think it's still available though.
4658871	4660712	Yeah, they cycle them through every now and then.
4660993	4662654	But Shadow of Colossus is on there now.
4663094	4669098	And also the, what was it, the poker game from Valve is on there now.
4669378	4671499	Or no, not Valve, Telltale Games.
4672020	4675282	The Poker at the Inventory 2 or whatever the second one was.
4675762	4678064	Oh yeah, I played that this week too for a little bit.
4678564	4679985	I suck at poker, that's what I learned.
4681021	4683022	Yeah, so those are available.
4683042	4686483	But anyways, this month, of course, there was Halo 3.
4687623	4689884	And then I forget the other game that was coming out.
4689964	4693585	But they say, though, they are going to continue on with the program.
4693805	4696946	Originally, it was only supposed to go through the launch of the Xbox One.
4697426	4699307	But they figured out, hey, you know what?
4699327	4700107	People like values.
4700167	4703168	So they are going to keep on doing two games a month.
4704881	4708342	So far, a lot of the games I already had, but you know, okay.
4708662	4710863	Yeah, I mean, it's cool that they're giving these away.
4711043	4713143	It's hard to complain about free stuff.
4713223	4713783	I'm going to.
4714103	4717524	It is a little hilarious that they're giving away Halo 3 for free.
4717864	4721465	I don't expect them to give away Halo 4, but I mean, come on, meet me halfway here.
4721545	4723246	Like maybe ODST or...
4723926	4751936	Yeah, I mean Halo Reach Yeah, or Anniversary Edition Because, you know, the games that are coming out on PlayStation, like the Shadow of the Colossus and I think that was about a year or two old and, I mean, Saints Row the Third about two years old and it was already on there, or Hell, Hitman Absolution To be fair, that is a little bit fuzzy math with Shadow of the Colossus because it is a remake of a much older game I understand, but the release of the HD version was about one or two years I'm with you, I'm with you, fair enough
4753076	4758058	I would love to see some PlayStation 1 games on there, or Final Fantasy.
4758078	4760099	Yeah, they kind of stopped doing the PS1 games, didn't they?
4760559	4761919	Yeah, like Final Fantasy or something.
4761939	4769342	They gave away Tactics at one point, I think that was on PSP, but I think they might have given away one of the older Final Fantasy games too, or they all went on sale or something.
4770482	4775684	Alright, let's see, NVIDIA doing an update to what's called the GeForce Experience.
4775744	4782947	This is that gameplay optimization software and I've never used this because I have the AMD or ATI, excuse me.
4782967	4788129	Yeah, I got a pop-up this morning saying that I needed to update that and I'm like, shit, I didn't even know I had it, so okay.
4788849	4799140	But I bring this up because one of the things they're going to be adding to this is that you're going to be able to capture gameplay if you have a 600 or a 700 series card so you can edit and you can upload.
4799180	4802423	And of course, even more people now streaming their games on Twitch.
4802443	4808049	I mean, this is becoming a real huge thing, which is, you know, as somebody who really loves independent broadcasting, I mean, I do kind of love it.
4808089	4809631	But at the same time, I'm like, wow.
4810331	4811791	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4835037	4835538	There you go.
4835558	4837059	That's basically what we have on the next-gen consoles.
4837079	4838380	Yeah, what the next-gen consoles are doing.
4838420	4839802	They're starting to catch this up a little bit.
4839822	4842524	But it's 10 to 20 minutes and not just 10.
4842824	4846948	I would imagine it's whatever you have available on your drive, too.
4847088	4850612	So it varies on the card and how fast it is.
4851472	4851892	Most likely.
4852613	4853113	So there it is.
4853233	4854873	Some folks are going to be checking that out.
4854913	4859235	I'm pretty sure ATI is only a matter of time before they have a response to this in their own thing.
4859775	4860595	If they don't already.
4860875	4862176	And then everybody will be on Twitch.
4862336	4862916	Exactly.
4862996	4863516	Watch my channel.
4863576	4864136	No, you can't.
4864456	4866417	I can't watch your channel because I'm streaming on my channel.
4866497	4867197	Yeah.
4867878	4868578	It's going to be that.
4869578	4874860	Eventually there's not going to be anyone to view these channels because everyone's going to be streaming their games and clogging the internet.
4875660	4879142	And it's all one site too, which is fascinating to me.
4879182	4885787	I mean, I know there's like Ustream and a couple others, but it's really fascinating to me that like one company has such a huge share of this.
4885827	4891151	Clearly they must be using those Microsoft Cloud Azure servers or something.
4892752	4895874	All right, let's travel to a time when gaming was a little more simple.
4897904	4899005	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4923826	4925348	Get off my lawn and play this game!
4941038	4941959	This game was great.
4942079	4942800	It had good music.
4942820	4944041	Why would you suggest it as a joke?
4944061	4944922	Yes, it did have good music.
4945102	4947665	I was just like, pick something, Dan.
4947745	4949547	He's like, I don't know Adventure Lolo.
4949627	4950668	I'm like, okay.
4951348	4951749	Sure.
4951769	4952229	Here's the music.
4955312	4956874	Even Loki's head-bobbing a little bit.
4956954	4957715	I used to play this game.
4958075	4959056	I know, I used to love this game.
4959076	4960077	This is a great game.
4960097	4960658	It is a great game.
4961578	4969002	So anyway, in the Adventures of Lolo, basically his sweetie Lala is captured by the villain King Egger.
4969442	4972464	So Lolo's like, bitch, you give me back my woman.
4972584	4975505	And he marches right up to the castle and kicks the door down.
4976106	4977606	And says, I'm not taking your shit.
4977987	4981308	You know, I don't seem to remember it going that way, but... That's my version.
4981368	4983730	Oh, you read the DarkSakura version.
4985169	4986850	And then he sets the castle on fire.
4987191	4988331	Yeah.
4988792	4990973	And then he and Lolo make little round babies.
4991654	4997578	He and Lala make little... Somehow Lolo became gay in your version.
4999600	5000861	Would that be auto-gay?
5003423	5004684	And that's how Kirby was made.
5004704	5004844	God...
5011167	5011827	We're going to break.
5012928	5013448	I'm done.
5015470	5015850	I'm done.
5016070	5018671	So yeah, you basically go through the stages and they get harder and harder.
5018732	5020733	Every four rooms you get to go upwards.
5021213	5022954	Closer to his victory.
5023074	5024615	His sweet, sweet victory.
5025716	5028998	And if you get stuck in a stage, you have the option of dying.
5029958	5030538	Which was great.
5031419	5032460	Goddammit, death.
5032900	5034701	So you commit suicide when you're done with life.
5035189	5039772	SSJ100 Matt in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says Lolo, the game with its own suicide button.
5040112	5040673	Exactly.
5041413	5048178	So you can destroy the enemies and shoot at them and you turn them into movable eggs but if you shoot the egg it disappears.
5049879	5060066	Now the game was produced I'm sorry, developed by HAL Laboratory and published by HAL America for the NES and it came out on April 20th the day after my birthday.
5061006	5062828	Remember it everybody and get me stuff.
5063168	5064329	420, it's not hard to remember.
5065209	5065670	Lolo 2 and Lolo 3
5086918	5089101	Um, it's just a fun little adventure game.
5089161	5090302	It's cute, you know.
5090483	5095108	It, it, yeah, it gets kind of frustrating, uh, uh, later on, you know.
5095749	5098673	But it's a fun game, and it's one that's pretty much held up.
5099534	5105841	I played probably more of Lolo 2 than the first one, or the third one, because by the third one came I was like, I don't care.
5106682	5108443	But, uh, I always had fun with it.
5108603	5111645	I've always loved little spatial puzzle games like that.
5112145	5113706	You know, with little enemies running around.
5113726	5116408	Well, like your gaming week, you've been playing like Bejeweled and Fractal.
5116448	5118649	It's a bunch of the same type of like puzzle games.
5119009	5120770	I fucking love Fractal, okay?
5121471	5122251	No, no, no, you don't.
5123192	5126914	I wish it was ten years later so I could do Fractal as my classic game.
5126934	5128875	Because it's like instant fucking classic.
5128895	5129456	You have no idea.
5129736	5131637	But anyway, back to Lolo and Lala.
5133922	5134622	It's a fun game.
5135022	5139825	Basically, like I said, Lolo 2 and Lolo 3 came out in 90 and 91 respectively.
5140165	5146088	There's a Game Boy version that came out in 1994 that came out with the same name, Adventures of Lolo.
5146169	5151271	In Japan, it came out as Lolo no Daibouken.
5152652	5155334	Lolo and Lala did appear in Kirby's Dream Land, Rob.
5156114	5164240	and in Kirby Superstar as Lololo and Lalala and in Kirby's Avalanche as Lololo and Lalala where they are antagonists.
5165061	5171665	I thought it was funny that you were making the Kirby joke earlier but Actdeft, yeah, was bringing up that same thing in our chat room and it was making me think as well.
5171705	5175928	I was like, oh yeah, both these games were made by, both Kirby and Lolo were HAL laboratories.
5176509	5183594	And if you think about it too, I always thought that the little blue critter in Guardian Legend was Lolo.
5185077	5186658	Yes, but it's... It's not.
5186898	5188399	It's from that shooter game.
5188459	5191801	It's Zan... Zan... Not Zanac.
5191881	5193782	I keep thinking, like, Zanax.
5194042	5194462	Is it Zanac?
5194502	5195023	It's a drug.
5195383	5196243	Yeah, I think it's Zanac.
5196363	5197784	The little lunar lander or whatever.
5197844	5198845	Yeah, that's what I thought.
5199345	5205208	But when I... You know, before I was familiar with Zanac, I, you know, I often thought that it was...
5208482	5208883	Lolo.
5210564	5216710	I mean, I guess having a blue puff ball with legs, you know, you can't get too far away from that.
5216770	5222175	So anyway, according to Actdeft, they also appeared in the Kirby anime.
5222416	5224057	So, yay.
5225319	5226620	So are you looking it up?
5227020	5229643	Well, I'm trying to remember what that little thing was called.
5230370	5231572	and somebody in the chat room.
5231612	5232973	What is the name of the little blue fucker?
5232993	5234275	I don't know how to spell Zanac.
5234355	5234776	That's why.
5234836	5237219	It's Z-A-N-A-C.
5238100	5238761	That was the game.
5238901	5240102	What was that little fucker called?
5240950	5241290	Outro Outro Outro
5265062	5265743	in North America.
5266043	5268505	In Japan, Zanuck was published by Pony Canyon.
5268705	5269846	But you know what this segment isn't about, Zanuck?
5269866	5271608	You know what else Pony Canyon has done?
5271888	5272128	What?
5272469	5273209	Porn!
5277092	5278393	At least they're not pink pineapple.
5279194	5284759	You know, we're talking about the classic game of the week, Adventures of Lolo, and now we're talking about porn.
5285794	5303105	Only here at Orange Laundry Well, I'm sure somewhere there's a Lolo-shaped vibrator or something, I don't know This is after you made Lolo gay and set the castle on fire No, auto-gay Alright, whatever He is only, no, he's self-sexual Or would it be auto-sexual?
5303145	5303766	Are you done?
5305167	5313752	I'm trying to think of what the politically correct term would be now I think it's auto-sexual I'm gonna be thinking about this all during the break I just love that it's to this music
5316452	5322375	Hey, this is a wonderful clip for the highlight show.
5325336	5326337	I love you guys, okay?
5326577	5326977	Alright.
5327397	5329958	Because I wouldn't have thought up all this fucked up shit if not for you.
5330599	5331159	I love you too.
5331199	5332079	Are you fucking done?
5332359	5333380	I'm fucking done!
5333540	5334100	God damn it.
5335261	5336741	The classic game of the week.
5336882	5338562	I think it was Adventures of Lolo.
5338822	5340003	But it might have been Zanac.
5340763	5343665	So... It's always the Guardian legend every episode.
5346164	5346945	Alright, that's it.
5346965	5347765	We're going to take a break.
5347785	5350206	Yes, I agree with Queen Simya, just narcissistic.
5350387	5355490	Stay classy, Part A. Live.VogNetwork.com Alright, and what's this?
5356090	5358972	DarkTetsuya says, wow, it took an hour and a half to get to the porn talk.
5359092	5359792	Sit down, be quiet.
5360353	5362414	Alright, we're going to take a quick break, guys.
5362434	5365296	When we come back, we have plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio up next.
5365636	5375502	Rapid Fire News, the Fugle Question of the Week, emails, and your phone calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.
5382461	5385342	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.
5385422	5393245	We are live on this Sunday night, October the 20th of 2013 with the 524th episode of our show.
5393305	5404090	You know, next week that means is episode 525, which might mean something because it's a multiple of 25 and it's a palindrome, but I guess we don't really do anything to celebrate.
5404110	5405030	I don't know what else to do.
5406131	5419846	it would be the Halloween show I would say we could do like a specially themed Halloween show but we never have so why start now what would we do sit here and play Silent Hill during the show I don't know if that would be as effective so
5420367	5447371	Alright, going to our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com Some people guessing the songs we were playing during the break Now for you folks listening on the podcast Obviously you can't hear the copyrighted songs we played during break But tonight for the live participants I promised some obscure stuff Because I didn't want to just play like Mega Man and Zelda And all the stuff you guys know But I did some slightly obscure stuff tonight And for those playing at home Like if you're not in chat but you are listening live You had Terranigma, started that off
5447751	5451333	The middle song nobody got, that's because it was from Cold Sept.
5451894	5453675	That was that card battle game meets Monopoly.
5453695	5457177	I should have noticed that because I remember you playing that game.
5457197	5458638	Yeah, I'm like the one guy that liked that game.
5459078	5463801	And then the third song that we played tonight was from Intelligent Cube or IQ.
5463901	5465322	Remember that on the PlayStation 1?
5465523	5466503	There you go.
5466523	5467624	Those are the songs we had there.
5468344	5469285	And I was looking at the chatroom.
5469985	5471205	Props to Orange Wright.
5471345	5476127	I'll say your name on air because he's the only one that knew two of the three, which is a pretty good score.
5476407	5478088	I didn't see anybody else really shout things out there.
5479349	5479669	Let's see.
5479949	5486592	Also in the chatroom at live.vognetwork.com, before we get back into the news here, Akuma JP says, I have a request for Sky.
5487232	5488912	Please do the Cookie Monster voice.
5489593	5492534	And I'm like, when did I do a Cookie Monster voice?
5493014	5493894	You've done the Grover voice.
5493934	5494835	I've done Grover.
5495655	5496115	Near, far.
5498036	5498456	Near?
5498736	5499337	Like that whole thing.
5499657	5502898	I've done the Grover voice, but then I'm like, what do I say is Cookie Monster?
5502938	5504438	And Akuma JP says, I don't know.
5504538	5505839	Porn, porn, porn.
5506299	5508280	And I'm thinking, is he thinking of that song?
5508540	5510261	The internet is for porn.
5510441	5511341	Like, is he thinking of that one?
5511821	5513042	That's not really Cookie Monster.
5513102	5516303	That's the ripoff Avenue Q style thing.
5516343	5516643	I don't know.
5517168	5519050	I'm still mad I missed that when it was in town.
5519210	5519890	I know.
5519910	5520711	It'll come back.
5520751	5524033	You know what they have at our local theater down in Folsom right now?
5525595	5529478	They have the stage production of Evil Dead the musical.
5529678	5530178	Oh, nice.
5530198	5531059	With the splash zone.
5531079	5531279	I'm like,
5532520	5534281	Dude, that's awesome!
5559001	5560022	Neither were the picture show.
5560042	5561263	I think they're both based on the play.
5561623	5564786	The first one was like on the Commodore 64 and Apple IIe.
5565086	5567047	It was kind of like an adventure game where you walk around.
5567067	5569829	I think you're trying to find like the transducer or something you can play as Brad or Janet.
5570110	5570810	It's not good.
5571291	5572251	It's really not good.
5572351	5573692	Like there's a reason why most people don't remember.
5573712	5574133	They should have...
5574733	5577075	Telltale Games should do an adventure game based on that.
5577095	5577935	Wouldn't that be something?
5577955	5584980	Well, in the 90s, the late 90s, there was a revival of Rocky Horror Show in London.
5585361	5585541	Yes.
5585621	5591665	And they did a CD-ROM game inspired by the 80s classic that went with that.
5591785	5597049	And it also wasn't very good because it was inspired by the 80s classic, which in turn, not good.
5597129	5598130	The one with the blonde Frank.
5598650	5598890	Yes.
5599151	5599391	Yeah.
5599631	5599831	Yeah.
5599891	5602234	Because not everybody wants to look like Tim Curry necessarily.
5602354	5610202	For the record, before I forget, coming up in a couple of weeks at my college, there's going to be another production of the Rocky Horror Show.
5610442	5610803	Oh, really?
5610863	5611624	It's a touring production.
5611704	5612044	Oh, nice.
5612204	5613205	I'll get the info for you.
5613506	5614567	I sent you the hairspray one.
5614587	5615448	This is the time.
5615468	5617129	If you're going to time warp, now's the time to do it.
5617249	5618571	I did also send you one for hairspray.
5619011	5619692	I do remember seeing that.
5619712	5620232	They're putting it on.
5620412	5620852	That's right.
5621253	5622773	I know how you love John Waters things.
5623034	5629158	Alright, I do love John Waters things, but let's be real, they're never going to do Pink Flamingos live unless it involves... That would be great!
5629438	5632940	Unless it involves drag queens, which then anything goes, right?
5633040	5635061	Maybe we can write to Peaches Christ.
5635261	5636102	Alright, maybe.
5637183	5640084	I'm sure she's done some John Waters movies.
5640104	5645368	But anyway, this is not a show about John Waters films as badly as I wish it was sometimes.
5645948	5647309	The Consumer Version of the Oculus Rift
5662680	5666802	Still no firm date on that yet, but it's supposed to be out sometime next year.
5667883	5674287	One of the other things they're looking at is maybe in the future also switching those displays that are inside of it to 4K displays.
5674767	5677749	So that would probably look pretty realistic, especially for some PC games.
5679349	5680290	So that's pretty exciting.
5683052	5689055	Anyways, there's a brand new game from one of the designers that used to work at Harmonix.
5689685	5716090	and it's kind of silly it's actually this indie studio called No Goblin and they have a game called Roundabout and Roundabout is basically this limo driving game where you're a chauffeur of a limo and you have to get through busy streets but the limo is always spinning and so you have to dodge traffic you do run over a lot of people to do different things like deliver kittens to orphans or you know run over the orphans on the way
5717991	5719091	Why am I reminded of that?
5719131	5720112	The kittens are safe.
5720492	5722914	Why am I reminded of that No Breaks Valet game?
5722974	5725115	It's sort of... The only thing to play on the Ouya.
5725215	5726616	It's sort of like an evolution.
5727096	5728136	Yeah, of that.
5728197	5729537	Or a revolution, if you will.
5732259	5732839	It looks silly.
5734941	5754839	I don't know, I think that, yeah, it's due out next year Although they're taking pre-orders for it right now At $10 normally it's going to be $15 And that includes a digital art book and soundtrack And I guess it's like 70s themed as well It was set in 1977 It looks funny, so yeah Definitely check out that video if you haven't seen it yet
5755659	5782249	and uh last but not least there's a brand new Minecraft mod and it's involved or involving quantum physics it's uh called Qcraft and allows I guess players to do different things including like um they have different blocks with quantum entanglements um I guess they're saying that uh observer dependency characteristics see this is all stuff that's over my head um
5783905	5784166	Cool.
5784446	5792401	I don't really know what exactly that means since I'm not really into quantum physics, but I like Minecraft mods, so let's dabble with that.
5793924	5794305	Alright.
5795207	5795668	Why not?
5796755	5799416	Minecraft will be one of the launch games on PlayStation 4, right?
5799896	5801257	Yeah, that is kind of neat.
5801757	5804538	So quantum physics in PlayStation 4, maybe?
5805558	5805799	All right.
5806319	5807719	Let's go on to some other news stories.
5808239	5813081	Pokemon X and Y I talked about earlier in the show, my first couple hours in that world.
5813161	5818443	Well, some people already beat the game, Shane, if you're out there listening, and others.
5818463	5820164	I think Actdeft was saying he was on the Final Four.
5820184	5820884	Before it came out, though.
5821024	5821324	DarkSakura.com
5841494	5860860	4 million copies of Pokemon X and Y it's just these games print money there they go and yeah they say by the way that Pokemon X and Y tracking ahead of Pokemon White 2 and Black 2 by more than 70% well that's because White 2 and Black 2 were obvious cash-ins this at least is a little more you know effort of a cash-in let's be real
5861500	5862521	Alright, other stuff.
5863481	5876208	I love that they are still making DLC for LittleBigPlanet and LittleBigPlanet is getting DLC in the form of Nightmare Before Christmas because it is that time of year and lots of people love this game and it's adorable.
5876288	5879430	The little sack boy and the Jack Skellington and the Sally outfit.
5879490	5882431	I single-handedly want to go back and play this game for this.
5882651	5884192	You don't even have to play LittleBigPlanet.
5884212	5886994	You can play LittleBigPlanet Cardian and still have that stuff in there too.
5887034	5887474	Nice.
5887734	5888094	Sack Skellington
5919281	5920941	Oh, shit.
5921421	5921761	All right.
5922562	5922822	One more.
5922842	5923882	So what is Sally called?
5923902	5924322	Saki?
5925323	5927143	I closed the tab because I stopped caring.
5927243	5928063	I'm going to buy it.
5928524	5929564	I'm going to buy it anyway.
5930104	5930384	Okay.
5931365	5931885	Calm down.
5932465	5933185	Calm your tits.
5933765	5934245	Calm them.
5935106	5935406	All right.
5935586	5938747	DarkSakura is freaking out because we have another story.
5938787	5940988	This is two weeks in a row now we're talking about ColecoVision.
5942262	5952206	because last week we talked about that whole Kickstarter thing, and I kind of said my honest piece that I don't think they're going to make their funding, but prove me wrong.
5952266	5952646	Please do.
5952686	5953346	I would not be sad.
5953966	5955187	However, we have something else.
5955267	5955807	This is different.
5956147	5960429	This is a different retro device that's going to bring back the ColecoVision.
5960489	5966631	It's a retro hardware company called AtGames, and they're going to be launching these devices that are based on the ColecoVision.
5966931	5971033	They already make Atari and Sega Genesis-based handhelds, so I'm assuming these are those –
5971793	5976916	Shitty little plug-and-play things you see just littering one of the aisles at Target, right?
5977196	5981919	So soon you're going to have a shitty little ColecoVision thing too, but it won't be shitty because it's ColecoVision.
5982429	5983690	I love my Clicovision, Rob.
5984671	5985171	Both of them.
6010430	6011150	Under the menorah.
6011530	6013551	Yeah, there's a menorah on top of a Klikovision.
6013571	6014792	Isn't that where you put the gifts?
6015452	6017513	That's how it works, right?
6017593	6019353	Where else are they supposed to go?
6019493	6020214	No, no.
6020514	6021754	You have the Hanukkah bush.
6021774	6023115	The guilt goes in my belly.
6025280	6025940	You know what though?
6026160	6029761	It is kind of funny that Hanukkah is the same week that Thanksgiving is.
6030682	6032402	So I'm going to make sweet potato pumpkin latkes.
6032562	6034163	Oh my god, Hanukkah is that early this year?
6034403	6034703	I know.
6035143	6038505	It's because, see they don't believe in solar calendars in Judaism.
6038865	6041906	Back in ancient Israel, we had the moon.
6042246	6043667	Stop complicating everything.
6044027	6044527	You know what?
6044627	6047228	I didn't invent the lunar calendar.
6047869	6049049	You guys are just high maintenance.
6049209	6049969	That's what it really is.
6049989	6051010	You're just high maintenance.
6051937	6052477	DarkSakura.com
6076764	6078146	All the damn e-mails
6092743	6100086	So anyway, they are over 600,000 supporters to have a PC version released.
6100467	6107870	And they have generated, as far as the sales of the game goes, like over a billion, what was it, in three days?
6108090	6109490	So yeah, it's made quite a bit of money.
6110871	6115333	So there are also sources in the industry saying that there should be a PC version out early 2014.
6115393	6115733	There are.
6117734	6119755	I was going to say, they're already making a PC version.
6119775	6123175	They just haven't announced it yet because why would they cannibalize the sales of the current versions?
6123436	6128597	Because people like to jump on bandwagons, especially if they know it's going to happen.
6130337	6133198	Who doesn't like to come back and say, I was right.
6133598	6135099	I totally called that.
6135519	6137279	You guys, I totally called that.
6137339	6140580	How about all of us who said we totally called it without signing a fucking petition?
6140620	6142460	They're going to make Grand Theft Auto 6, you guys.
6142520	6144421	I fucking called it here on OLR.
6146824	6172925	also if you happen to pre-order Zelda A Link Between Worlds you get a musical chest it comes in a nice big box now granted this is just for the US this is buying the bundle version the 3DS XL that comes with the game it has a golden Triforce cover and A Link Between Worlds loaded on the console and
6173545	6179827	and this was already linked from a GameStop Black Friday ad.
6180667	6190730	So as far as any type of European release, Game actually did confirm that they're getting the musical treasure chest as a pre-order bonus.
6190910	6194651	So all of our friends in the UK, you're not screwed this time.
6197072	6201313	And, well, I don't know if I'm happy or sad, Rob.
6204449	6206430	Well, you're always happy to be in my presence.
6206531	6206971	I know that.
6207011	6207691	You know what?
6210393	6220341	We have a little bit more news about the Mass Effect franchise that will have a brand new story completely unrelated to Shepard or the crew or any of them.
6220981	6224504	So basically, Bioware wants to take it in a new direction.
6225345	6230629	And they have said, again, doesn't necessarily relate to the Shepard events whatsoever.
6231549	6234731	But it has to be Mass Effect Universe.
6234751	6235591	It's not just a spin-off.
6235611	6237312	It has to be a part of the series.
6238273	6244936	So... But they said something similar six months ago, and we all grew to accept it then, right?
6245116	6245576	Yeah.
6245877	6246137	Yeah.
6247217	6253042	I don't know how I feel because, you know, I used to, back in the day, I used to want a Mass Effect MMO.
6253122	6258926	I thought it would be fantastic to play in that universe, to go around and hang out on the different worlds and do stuff.
6258966	6261248	And maybe if it was something kind of...
6262809	6267752	Kind of more like that where it wasn't just all the human-centric bullshit that was, you know, Mass Effect 3.
6268412	6270733	Then I would be completely okay with that.
6270793	6274655	But at this point, I don't necessarily trust what Bioware is going to do.
6275235	6277356	So I'm probably still going to buy it because I'm a whore.
6280758	6281198	I don't know.
6283839	6284239	All right.
6284840	6288962	I'm still looking forward to it because, you know, it's Mass Effect and it'll be great.
6289102	6289762	You know what I want?
6290642	6291543	Turian's the game.
6292356	6297639	Queen Simia is in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com and says still needs Turians and Krogan.
6298579	6310285	Alan Alchemy says it can't be a sequel that takes place in the same universe unless it's literally thousands of years later because otherwise they'll have to pick a canon ending between the red, blue, green horse shit and that would be bad.
6310685	6313686	Well, they did pick a canon ending for part two, didn't they?
6314226	6316487	You wouldn't have had a three if they went with a bad ending in two.
6317168	6318328	Everyone dies!
6318428	6319569	Oh my god, have you watched that?
6320069	6320770	Oh yeah, it's great.
6320790	6321370	It's hilarious.
6321590	6323212	I mean, it's sad, but it's hilarious.
6323232	6327155	The YouTube of the Mass Effect 2 bad ending or whatever, which is the everybody dies ending.
6327235	6328917	OMG spoilers for a four-year-old game.
6329397	6329878	Whatever.
6330018	6331419	They have the Shepard.
6331659	6334361	The thing that makes that video funny is they have like the ugliest Shepard possible.
6334862	6335682	At least the one I saw.
6336223	6340827	Have you seen the ones that have hacked it to give Shepard Garrus' skeleton?
6342765	6343946	Yes, that was creepy.
6343966	6348147	There's another one that did that to give Jacob Garrus' skeleton and he's just got this huge mouth.
6348427	6349948	It's so fucking weird.
6351909	6354470	And yeah, Reginator asks, so no more Garrus.
6354510	6357191	They won't Garrus all the things?
6357271	6358431	I won't Garrus all the things.
6358812	6360592	Does this make DarkSakura a sad panda?
6360852	6364774	DarkSakura's kind of getting over some of her attachment in the fandom, so...
6365214	6375644	and also speaking of herself in the third person so at this point I would actually like a new series that has characters that I'm attached to but not like singularly attached to.
6375724	6380169	I would like to be able to explore more options instead of having just the one freaking awesome option.
6382671	6384453	I'm sorry I wasn't into Lizardman.
6385354	6387756	Alright, are we ready to get to the foogle question of the week?
6387936	6389618	I sure hope so because it's about that time.
6397639	6401541	You take Facebook, you take Google+, you slam those words together, you get Fugle.
6401641	6405443	It's the Fugle Question of the Week, where we ask a question of our Facebook and Google Plus communities.
6406203	6410105	And starting on Facebook tonight with some of these answers to this question.
6410866	6411706	Two words.
6412246	6413167	Cookie clicker.
6414047	6414808	Have you heard of it?
6415248	6417089	Do you know the cookie clicker, DarkSakura?
6417249	6417489	No.
6417749	6419390	You click, and it gives you cookies.
6419991	6421334	I want cookies for real.
6421375	6423862	You hire Grandma to make cookies for you.
6424163	6424423	No.
6424544	6425968	And then you get cookie cloners.
6425988	6427753	I don't... La, la, la, la, don't wanna...
6428379	6428619	All right.
6428920	6434865	Well, anyhow, Cookie Clicker is a free-to-play web game that has been found to be pretty addicting for some, and it's inspired parodies.
6434905	6440710	Like, I don't know if you saw, but there's a Clicking Bad, which is it replaces Cookie Clickers with Breaking Bad references.
6441010	6446956	So you're cooking meth, and you get, like, RVs and abandoned trailers and all this, and bathtubs.
6447897	6451500	Anyway, so there's all these parodies of Cookie Clicker.
6452480	6458184	And if you've been listening to Horde House at all, we've talked extensively about Cookie Clicker, and I'll just leave it at that.
6459885	6468170	Anyhow, do you have a free-to-play web game that maybe you're embarrassed or proud to admit you've spent way too much time?
6468330	6469150	What is the game?
6469290	6471151	And share the link with the rest of our listeners.
6471211	6474713	If you want links to these games, check out our Facebook and our Google Plus page.
6475054	6475594	So here we go.
6475754	6476915	Unfolded Raptor says...
6477395	6477876	Thanks for watching!
6493072	6500837	Our good buddy from Koopa Club, Renee, says, There are a few free-to-play games I've enjoyed over the years, but the best one being The Kingdom of Loathing.
6501297	6511162	Simple interface, much like Clicking Bad, but totally aloof and lighthearted fantasy story, especially when you can be a pasta-mancer or a saucer-roar, and it's been running for 10 years.
6511503	6513584	Even I played The Kingdom of Loathing for a hot minute.
6513924	6516285	I think a lot of people have checked this game out, and it's a fun one.
6516325	6516685	I haven't.
6517306	6517986	Oh, you should check it out.
6518006	6518566	I think you'd have fun.
6518726	6518967	Maybe.
6519267	6519487	All right.
6520187	6524570	Degenerate Johnny says, I'm actually proud to say that I play My Vegas Slots on Facebook.
6524971	6534837	It's a game in which you play slot games and table games in order to earn points that can be spent on real Vegas rewards, like a drink at the Mirage or complimentary rooms at the MGM Grand.
6535197	6535678	P.S.
6535798	6538680	I'm at 10 million cookies on the Cookie Clicker mobile app.
6538960	6539760	You're welcome, Rob.
6540401	6541522	I got to 15 million.
6542002	6542502	Suck it!
6543423	6548546	Codeman says, well, it's a web-based and mobile game, Robot Unicorn Attack.
6548726	6549207	Oh, God.
6550328	6550789	Love it!
6550949	6551289	Love it!
6551850	6559641	This game is beyond addicting, and after Robot Unicorn Attack 2 was released, they added a feature where you gain levels, unlock new abilities, and you can customize your unicorn.
6559961	6561964	Plus online PvP matches.
6563005	6564748	I didn't know they put PvP in the game.
6564968	6565489	Oh my god.
6565529	6566270	That's awesome.
6566630	6568011	And now that song is stuck in my head.
6568232	6568832	Freaking erasure.
6569473	6573977	Always I wanna be Well, in Robot Unicorn Attack 2, you can play the never-ending story.
6574217	6576279	They have like DLC and you can do the never-ending story.
6576299	6576620	You know what?
6576740	6579823	As awesome as that sounds, it has to always be erasure every time.
6580143	6580584	It does.
6581464	6582105	It really does.
6583827	6585088	Have you played Robot Unicorn Attack?
6587162	6587523	What?
6588644	6589245	Of course I have.
6589265	6590347	Okay.
6590567	6591348	How good are you at it?
6592249	6592810	Pretty good.
6592830	6593191	Okay.
6593211	6597216	I need to read the rest of the Fugle answers here to this song here.
6597457	6597737	Okay.
6604298	6604998	Thank you for watching!
6619116	6622240	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
6636157	6646671	Critical Myth says, At one point there was a Spartacus clicky game on Facebook I was fairly addicted to, and I was playing a game called Equilibrium on my Vita for weeks earlier this year.
6648273	6652018	Ragenator says, To be honest, I never got into the free-to-play web game scene.
6652979	6655722	WONK WONK WONK WONK
6670678	6673500	and for the longest time would have scoffed at the idea of PC gaming.
6673800	6683405	It wasn't until the theft last year of my original laptop, my PS3 and TV that I got into PC gaming, albeit begrudgingly if only because I couldn't afford to replace my TV and PS3.
6683805	6685886	Now I thoroughly enjoy PC gaming.
6686066	6690268	Well Ragenator, go check out some of these links people are leaving and you can fill up your PC with crap.
6692550	6699223	Austin S says, oh, and I'm sure we've all played this one, being music game fans we are, FFR, Flash Flash Revolution.
6699623	6701327	It was a web-based step mania game.
6701807	6703851	I used to play it a lot back in the day, but it's dated now.
6705174	6705594	Fair enough.
6706034	6708115	Alright, let's go on to Google+.
6708155	6709376	We have a couple answers there.
6710176	6712277	Actdeft says, mostly Facebook games.
6712857	6716819	I used to play them a lot, but I eventually got tired of them, like Songpop or even You Don't Know Jack.
6717239	6720461	I do play the occasional Bejeweled Bluets and Tetris Friends there, though.
6721321	6724242	And lastly, Redertainment says, yes, The Sims on Facebook.
6724563	6729305	I never spent a cent on it and got really far in it until I got a girlfriend and started having sex in the game.
6730285	6731885	Then I got oddly disinterested.
6732145	6732486	Weird.
6733166	6738367	I also started playing The Sims FreePlay on my iPad until I found out I couldn't play it at work because I wasn't connected to the internet.
6738627	6739427	That's stupid.
6739747	6742748	The game is downloaded on my iPad and the file size is mighty large.
6743108	6745208	Why can't my save be on the iPad as well?
6746009	6749229	I guess because it's harder to take your money if you're not connected to the internet.
6750430	6750670	Alright.
6751370	6752330	Bye Erasure.
6752670	6753210	I'll miss you.
6754730	6756851	You totally should use this every time for the segment now.
6757521	6769565	Cookie Clicker is definitely mine.
6769785	6770505	They have an iPhone.
6770885	6771945	It's not official, though.
6772486	6774086	It's a follow-up to Horde House.
6774666	6779148	The iPhone one is Cookie Clickers, and it's a knockoff game.
6779188	6781008	It's still pretty good, but it's not official.
6781048	6783509	There is an official one in the making, just to say.
6784665	6788246	I can't remember really the last free one that I did.
6789307	6791267	Because remember when I got my iCade?
6792268	6795869	I kind of went on a purchasing spree, which I probably shouldn't have done.
6796129	6796910	Oops.
6799310	6802692	Yeah, all the ones that I actually still have on my phone are...
6804833	6806214	are ones I paid for.
6806534	6808895	I mean, I'm actually looking at my folder now.
6809695	6809915	Yeah.
6811676	6812517	I have Robot Unicorn.
6812697	6813237	I played for that.
6813637	6814618	Duke Big, I paid for that.
6814718	6815678	Droplets, I paid for that.
6817579	6819020	Yeah, everything on here I paid for.
6820040	6821441	So, no, nothing free.
6821917	6822797	Loki, what about you?
6824138	6836084	I don't think there's really been anything that I've played for free aside from that time when I was doing the whole Ready Player One thing where I had to play that really shitty garage sale game on Facebook.
6836204	6836864	Oh, God.
6837104	6839185	But I didn't necessarily want to play that.
6839325	6839885	What ever happened?
6839925	6841766	Did that guy really win that DeLorean or whatever?
6841946	6842487	Yeah, he did.
6842827	6848629	There was a guy that won the DeLorean because he got the world record in Joust, I think, on the 2600.
6848669	6848730	Wow.
6850632	6850952	All right.
6850992	6851813	Grats to him, I guess.
6852473	6852854	All right.
6853814	6855816	More stories coming your way up now.
6855936	6856236	Loki.
6856876	6858397	Yeah.
6858778	6859758	No DeLorean for me.
6859778	6860099	That's right.
6860139	6863301	It probably would have been more.
6863401	6865522	You wouldn't have wanted to pay the taxes on it.
6865562	6868725	Well, the taxes and then on top of that, servicing the thing.
6868765	6874068	The only service center that does DeLoreans, at least around here, is in L.A.
6874148	6876130	So that wouldn't be very convenient.
6876150	6876630	Yeah.
6877191	6880234	Um, okay, so let's talk a little bit about the PlayStation 4.
6880654	6882396	Hey, you want to check out a PlayStation 4?
6882496	6889643	Well, there's going to be some demo kiosks coming soon to, uh, Sony stores, GameStop, Target, Walmart, and Best Buy.
6890544	6895568	And, uh, they have a website that you can actually go to to see where they are at.
6895769	6898411	If you go to, it's the experienceplaystation.com.
6899752	6918201	and you put in your zip code and they'll show you a map with all the different stores that are you know supplying it and we have none there is absolutely none in our area so I noticed Best Buy is making a lot of room for both the PlayStation 4 and the Xbox although on the whole
6918841	6929306	on the whole it seems like Best Buy has really scaled back their gaming sections I guess in favor of other stuff and some of the things we've been hearing about the company you know on CNN or other news sites.
6929326	6947534	Go where the margins are bigger because gaming isn't it that's for sure I guess so so yeah and then it's a little I don't understand this to be honest and this is basically you can pre-order digital downloads of PlayStation 4 launch titles
6948394	6970964	look if you're willing to give them your credit card they'll take it on the PlayStation 3 and guess what you get for doing that no discount so why the fuck would you do that because you want to be able to play that shit day one even though if you're gonna have to go and download it anyways or go and pick up your PlayStation 4 somewhere unless Amazon's bringing it to you
6971244	6971825	Let's put it this way.
6972185	6981232	Yeah, I know you can partially download the game and then you can start playing it once you've downloaded the game, but the thing is, these downloads are fucking huge.
6981252	6988317	Remember, we mentioned on a couple shows back they had this NBA Ultimate Fan Pack or Super Fan Pack or something like that.
6988357	6991560	It's basically digital versions of the current gen and next gen versions of the game.
6991920	6996544	The next gen versions of the game were like 60 gigabytes to download.
6997705	6998425	I'm sorry, but there's...
6999546	7000547	Why would you want to do that?
7000587	7002889	Just go to retail and buy the game.
7002929	7006492	Yeah, you may have to pay taxes on it, but just go buy it.
7006612	7008454	Or, hey, here's a wonderful idea.
7008494	7010996	Maybe wait until Black Friday and see if they discount that shit.
7012217	7012918	Might be something.
7014759	7019762	I don't know, there's just no reason I can see to pre-order a game unless you get something.
7019962	7022344	I mean, because so far they haven't really said anything.
7022364	7035892	It says, I guess, the only game that you can pre-order that seems like you get something for is Warframe, which is free, so I don't understand that at all, but it's free and I guess you get some in-game money and exclusive weapon skins.
7036152	7036973	So sure, why not?
7037033	7041395	Go pre-order that if you're going to get a PlayStation 4 in case you want to play it because it's free.
7042996	7059166	But as far as Knack and Killzone or something like that, unless they're charging me like $53.99 or some sort of discount there, I just don't see a reason to pre-order anything for a digital download.
7059186	7059447	I mean...
7060387	7064889	Fuck, if you want to do a digital download and you decide that you want to do that, do it at launch day.
7064909	7072693	Make that decision on launch day, not necessarily... Well, it just goes back to that old thing we were talking about way back when the Xbox One was rumored to have all these restrictions.
7072713	7074634	It's like, what's the benefit of going digital?
7074754	7077535	It's not like they're not going to have a digital copy for you.
7077595	7080897	It's not like they're going to sell out digital copies of a game.
7080957	7083338	I mean, it just doesn't make any sense.
7085306	7090769	They just want a really easy way for you to hit the button and they can charge the card and make another sale.
7090889	7091509	Really easy.
7091769	7092790	That's what this is all about.
7093210	7093651	Nothing more.
7094731	7096272	I think you're thinking too much about it, Loki.
7097493	7107319	Alright, well, this game fell off our radar years ago and the last time we were talking about this video game, I think we were exclusively a show about music-based video games.
7107759	7110641	This game was being developed for an arcade release in 2005.
7112322	7115744	I don't know if you guys remember when we were talking about a game called Neon FM.
7116144	7116584	Remember this?
7117105	7123048	Because it had like freeze pop and it had some really other like kind of questionably good songs in it.
7123408	7131913	Well, it's been a long time, obviously, and this game has kind of reinvented itself a little bit because Unit E is the group now that's putting this arcade cabinet out.
7131973	7138837	I think I heard a rumor once that at one point Betson, who ended up doing the DDR cabinets years later, was going to do this game and they didn't.
7139257	7140798	So now Unity is doing this.
7141318	7164218	and it's no longer a dance game that's the other big change it is now a I guess to me it would strike me more as like poppin music because it's got the big circular pads that you hit yeah it was originally supposed to be played the same way except the dance pad would look like what that pad looks like right there it was like three on the bottom two on the top it wasn't like your typical DDR dance it was like beatmania with your feet yeah feetmania right
7165791	7169574	So yeah, so Neon FM is apparently now like a thing.
7170214	7171835	There's video out there.
7171875	7173216	You can see it on YouTube and so forth.
7174477	7176638	But is Girls Butts in it?
7176998	7179080	And it is, because I can see that in the screenshot.
7179180	7179900	Apparently it is.
7180020	7180961	Apparently it is.
7181021	7182622	This song is so awful.
7182842	7186825	That song is horrible, but I think by now it probably gets the joke vote, right?
7187794	7188675	No, it's still awful.
7189336	7193461	So apparently it is still on target for release this year to show up in arcades.
7194382	7198567	That is if you still have an arcade near you that contains games that don't shoot out tickets.
7199549	7200870	I will say the cabinet does look nice.
7200950	7202172	I hope this does show up in an arcade.
7202526	7203187	Giant Tetris Giant Tetris
7224824	7227765	But Neon FM, no word if Neon FM will shoot out tickets.
7227865	7228586	I don't believe it does.
7228926	7230506	But that's all they had to do.
7230646	7233708	If they wanted to make this game super popular, just put a little ticket dispenser in it.
7234388	7235969	And the better you do on a song, the more tickets you get.
7236589	7236789	Yeah.
7237109	7240450	Well, being that it's based off Step Mania, they could probably do that.
7240510	7243992	Or if you play that horrible girl's butt songs, it'll actually take your tickets.
7244972	7246192	as like a penalty.
7247273	7250913	If you play the girl's butts, then you get like kicked in the crotch.
7251134	7251814	I would laugh.
7251894	7252634	A boot comes out.
7252994	7258535	I would really laugh if they had like a game like that where the tickets would go in and out depending on how well you did.
7258955	7265077	I guess it would get all fucked up though because, you know, if you tore it off and then it goes back in.
7265097	7270578	Well, they should be in like a glass case that you can't get into until the very end where it cuts it or something.
7271258	7272900	Like, it should be like, look, I'm going to give you all these.
7273040	7273520	No, I'm not.
7273540	7274341	I'm going to give you all these.
7274401	7274781	No, I'm not.
7274881	7275282	What?
7275362	7276523	Have you ever worked at an arcade?
7277744	7278625	Of course not.
7279266	7279646	I did.
7279846	7282148	Why would I subject myself to that bullshit?
7282468	7287553	Two of my first jobs involved arcade games, and I know for a damn fact someone would figure out how to get in there.
7287873	7293319	My minimum wage job, I already told you, my minimum wage job was I worked at a video store and we rented porn, and that was awesome.
7294920	7295240	Anyhow.
7295481	7295681	Well...
7297743	7298123	Whatever.
7298624	7299044	Whatever.
7299404	7300684	DarkSakura, what do you have for us for the news?
7301005	7301865	I have some shit.
7302125	7302305	No.
7304366	7312969	Blizzard has once again changed the name of what was Blizzard All-Stars and is now Heroes of the Storm.
7314109	7315690	I don't know why the fuck they're calling it that.
7316050	7318511	But yeah, they even are quoted saying, yep, we changed it again.
7319391	7325892	So basically, they've also said, set aside whatever you think you knew about Blizzard All-Stars.
7326512	7332634	And it's supposed to be, more about it will be revealed at BlizzCon November 8th and 9th.
7333554	7337295	And there apparently is a trailer online, so look for it.
7339250	7340831	I kind of am like, whatever.
7341091	7352134	Although, I have to say that the picture on here of the, um, whoever the, uh, orc is, why am I saying orc, uh, whatever the fuck they're called.
7352174	7353955	God, I played World of Warcraft for how long?
7354707	7356750	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7370931	7375595	It opens it up to a bigger audience too because they're going to have to compete against all these other MOBAs that are already out there.
7375716	7389909	But I think it's going to be interesting because I think the Heroes of the Storm or whatever has the potential to draw in a whole new audience to this with their built-in Warcraft audience and the people that are running the Hearthstone and all this.
7390289	7392231	I think it's going to be very interesting to see how that –
7392631	7392731	So...
7423379	7423880	and Sucking.
7424200	7428682	It's interesting that they're going to kind of have their own answer to League of Legends now.
7429222	7430703	By the way, can I ask you about something?
7430743	7432804	Not to go on a Horde House tangent, but I'd love to know what you think.
7433084	7433344	Okay.
7433604	7437326	What did you think about the Siege of Orgrimmar ending?
7439099	7467912	I like that it was different if you were Alliance or Horde but here's the thing I hate to keep comparing it but I can't help myself like times have changed right like it's cool that you get a two and a half minute cinematic or whatever than when you beat the game but over in Final Fantasy 14 like that ending was seriously like 15 minutes long and it was very satisfying and it was just I don't know like it kind of just made the Warcraft endings look a little bit like oh that's all you get for putting up with all the abuse you take in LFR
7468752	7473093	But as far as what went down story-wise, that was kind of obvious.
7473913	7477614	Well, I mean, we knew who was going down, but I was actually a little bit surprised at who took over.
7478474	7479115	I wasn't at all.
7479635	7485496	But I was actually a little bit more surprised with Douchebag, with Varian.
7486196	7487877	So that was a little bit more what surprised me.
7487897	7491358	Well, I was also a little bit surprised that Jaina was so bloodthirsty in the ending, too.
7491378	7495099	Because they're really trying to make her the Alliance answer to Sylvanas.
7495519	7496939	They're really trying to do that.
7497583	7498725	It just doesn't suit the character.
7498765	7501890	I mean, it didn't surprise me given, you know, having your whole town blown up.
7502470	7505916	But at the same time, it just seemed out of character for her.
7506276	7506517	Anyway.
7506797	7507278	Okay.
7507298	7507999	Too much wow.
7508039	7508439	No, no, no.
7508499	7510402	I wanted to ask because... That's fair.
7510943	7511524	It's a video game.
7511845	7512505	It is a video game.
7512526	7513126	We can talk about it.
7514096	7518378	You don't like it, email us, mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com Stop talking about that stupid game.
7518918	7519718	Alright, Loki.
7521519	7530802	So Ubisoft has adjusted their financials and basically have deemed Splinter Cell Blacklist and Rayman Legends underperformers.
7531943	7540226	They said, you know, we've had games that were released for which we anticipate today lower sales than we anticipated when we first gave our targets.
7541046	7545271	and already released games, of course, such as Splinter Cell and Rayman and others.
7547433	7551917	You know, it also probably doesn't help, too, that, as we mentioned earlier, they delayed Watch Dogs and The Crew.
7553519	7555100	So, I don't know.
7555140	7556421	What could they have done better?
7557122	7557202	Um...
7558263	7559044	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7575488	7590070	I don't know maybe it's just I know the reviews weren't that fantastic for Blacklist Rayman Legends look good but I guess a lot of people you know it would have been a better February title I think I think people saw right through what they did with Rayman Legends I think
7590450	7603157	It's not that, like, pissing off the Nintendo fanboys had that big an impact, but I think a lot of people saw, right, the people that would tend to buy games on day one see right through the fact that it was a Wii U game that was backed into the parking spot of a 360 PlayStation 3.
7610160	7621049	And even now, with the Wii U version coming out in September versus February, that's still a lot more months in between there and systems being sold that there's potential buyers.
7621509	7623110	I mean, they kind of had to do that.
7623130	7624592	That was the logical way to do it.
7624772	7633939	They should have released the Wii U game the way they'd always planned, and then they should have released the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 version later and called it a Gold Edition or an Enhanced.
7634239	7637602	Make it feel like an Enhanced version, not a scaled-back version.
7638233	7644656	Maybe, or maybe just Nintendo wasn't giving them any money to make it exclusive, and so there was no incentive to do that.
7644877	7648919	Maybe if they threw a little bit of money their way, then they could have had another good exclusive title.
7649159	7654161	I don't think these games are necessarily damned, though, because it's going to have staying power throughout the holidays.
7654621	7662485	Again, I said the people who will buy it on day one may be able to see right through it, but you're still going to have... It's a very family-accessible, family-friendly title.
7662545	7664446	I think Rayman does very well.
7665587	7667368	Parents aren't afraid to buy that for their younger kids.
7667768	7670609	So I think that title can still tend to do well throughout the holidays.
7671129	7671469	I don't know.
7671549	7672089	I got to be honest.
7672109	7679771	When I hear a story like this, I think about just a few months ago, we heard that Square Enix story about the guy getting up there saying Tomb Raider underperformed.
7680131	7681951	And we were all sitting here going, are you high?
7682371	7686492	Tomb Raider was like the best that they've done in that series in a very long time.
7686572	7692333	It's a little different, you know, because with like Splinter Cell, that was the number four game of the month in August.
7692373	7695374	They're Madden, Saints Row 4, and Disney Infinity beating it out.
7696214	7708105	Um, I mean, there's not a whole lot of other games besides those, you know, in the month, uh, versus Tomb Raider, which is like one of the top selling games of the month.
7708566	7712609	I think it was like one or two, you know, cause Bioshock Infinite came out that same month.
7712649	7715251	So it's hard to tell.
7715271	7719155	I don't think it outsold Bioshock Infinite, but it was definitely popular.
7720016	7720116	Um,
7721613	7741636	so I could see the demand there for Tomb Raider and stuff but I'm not seeing a lot of people saying oh I need copies of Splinter Cell because it's sold out Tomb Raider was like oh I need more Tomb Raider but I don't know we'll see maybe they still have Rainbow Six Patriots supposed to be coming out at some point you know and um
7743590	7743971	Sasson's Creed
7758151	7759613	Thank you for watching!
7777993	7778774	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7796093	7796933	Here's the thing about the game.
7796973	7798794	Yoshi's Cookie wasn't developed by Nintendo.
7798814	7800594	It was developed by Bulletproof Software.
7800955	7805896	Bulletproof made the Tetris port for the Game Boy in 1989, which was huge.
7806336	7809537	So that's why Nintendo trusted them with the Yoshi stuff.
7809957	7815499	But expired licenses being as they are, the game is no longer available for sale.
7816219	7818921	This is not the first game to be delisted for similar reasons.
7819481	7821803	Konami's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, no longer available.
7822243	7825625	Irem did a version of R-Type that was on the Virtual Console, no longer there.
7825685	7828948	The Donkey Kong Country Trilogy, also no longer there.
7829708	7833571	So if you didn't get this game, I guess you'll have to go steal it from a ROM.
7834471	7836572	Or go find it at a garage sale.
7836613	7837153	Good luck to you.
7839034	7840275	I guess I could lend it to somebody.
7840643	7841683	Do you have the Super Nintendo version?
7841703	7842824	Because I like the Super Nintendo version.
7843044	7844204	I don't believe I do actually.
7844324	7845125	I might have to check.
7845225	7847746	I mean, at this point, I don't know what I have.
7848046	7851307	After playing the Super Nintendo version, the NES version felt kind of gimped.
7851527	7852988	You know, as sometimes happens.
7853008	7855949	There were a few titles like that that were on both platforms.
7856589	7860051	But anyway, it's not like it was that good of a puzzler.
7860091	7860971	It was just kind of fun.
7861671	7863332	It had a good versus mode in it.
7864232	7870555	Alright, it is that time of the week where we go to the mailbag where you guys email us because every week you do email us.
7871016	7883483	Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com Again, our email is Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com DarkSakura's going to dive into the email bag head first and pull out, oh, an email or two or seven that she feels like reading tonight.
7883983	7884643	DarkSakura!
7885384	7885704	Mail!
7886004	7887245	Well, thanks.
7887665	7891287	Well, FlaccoJones sent us an email that has a YouTube link in it.
7894387	7907779	Hey OLR, since Mark Hamill has retired from doing the Joker voice, I wanted to know what you thought of Troy Baker taking over the role for the new Batman Arkham game.
7908199	7911882	I had my doubts until I heard a sample reading from The Killing Joke.
7912563	7914184	I've heard it, it's awesome.
7914204	7917025	Actually, I remember hearing about this, but I didn't hear the actual voice.
7917065	7919327	So, courtesy of Flaco Jones... Memories can be vile.
7919367	7919647	Perfect.
7944147	7947751	Repulsive little brutes like children, I suppose.
7951476	7952837	But can we live without them?
7953378	7956582	Memories are what our reason is based upon.
7957343	7960727	If we can't face them, we deny reason itself.
7961327	7961648	Okay.
7962629	7963270	He gets a pass.
7963370	7963730	That's good.
7964090	7964471	I like that.
7965762	7966523	Bioshock Infinite, Saints Row
7984332	7984632	either.
7985894	7988036	What would you have played that he was in?
7988096	7990578	I'm trying to think because he's done a ton of anime.
7991299	7991699	Hold on.
7992480	7994682	Which I don't really watch dubbed anime.
7994722	7995522	Is he 13?
7995643	7996043	Snow?
7996103	7997164	He was Snow in 13?
7997905	7998065	Oh.
7998405	8000187	Kid Icarus Uprising you mentioned you played?
8000207	8000667	Yeah.
8000727	8001308	He's in that.
8003089	8003910	Metal Gear Solid.
8003930	8005572	He was in Yu Yu Hakusho.
8005612	8007554	He's Ocelot in 5.
8007614	8008615	Okay, so he was Hawkeye.
8009776	8010016	Hmm.
8010901	8013262	which I have watched because of Jennifer Hale.
8013582	8015903	Oh, and he's James in Silent Hill 2.
8016243	8017744	Oh, but only in the HD version, I think.
8019324	8021305	Oh, then yeah, which I didn't play either.
8021805	8022405	Oh, well, anyhow.
8023526	8023926	Moving on.
8024426	8028748	Yeah, well, no, he was Robin in Arkham City and Two-Face.
8029308	8031849	So I knew he had been in another of the games before.
8032569	8034750	GameGuru in chat says, wait, that wasn't Mark Hamill?
8034990	8036451	Nope, nope, that was Troy Baker.
8037171	8037491	Good job.
8038342	8047711	Yeah, I mean, I'd have to say that's pretty good if, you know, you can actually get him confused with Mark Hamill, so... Anyway, moving on, this comes from...
8049574	8049954	Brian.
8051895	8054735	And I did see Shane say that he's sung with Akira Yamaoka's band.
8055856	8056056	Okay.
8056876	8057756	Hi, OLR.
8058256	8061177	I'm disappointed with current gen Star Trek games.
8061557	8063818	Star Trek Legacy was released on 360 in 06.
8064218	8066799	It took the franchise seven more years to release a Star Trek game.
8067439	8070960	Overall, the franchise has released low quality games for current gen consoles.
8071280	8074001	Do you see a future for Star Trek games in the next gen consoles?
8074181	8074501	Thanks.
8075641	8077022	Well, Brian, I don't think so.
8077742	8078022	I mean...
8079062	8082865	If they do anything, it's going to definitely be like a movie tie-in, I think.
8083465	8085506	Well, the last movie tie-in was pretty terrible, too.
8085546	8086207	That's the problem.
8086487	8095593	There's nothing to make the games really on right now unless they go back and do a new Next Generation game, which would be awesome.
8096773	8102277	They do have the Star Trek Next Generation pinball table in Pinball Arcade, just random tangent, because when I saw that, I got giddy.
8103757	8104417	I will say this, though.
8104717	8110579	One thing that email left out, and I don't know if that's just because this person is very console-focused, but you neglected Star Trek Online.
8111359	8112899	I mean, it's free to play.
8112999	8113720	It's worth a look.
8113800	8116000	I don't think it's bad, especially if you're a Star Trek fan.
8116020	8116880	I think it's worth checking out.
8116900	8123402	And I have to say that they did actually retool the skill system that I kind of got pissed off when they changed it the first time.
8124322	8125643	It's a lot more manageable now.
8126424	8135030	Space battles are still kind of, you know, you have to ease into it from beginning to Admiral for you to finally get... And they got rid of Rear Admiral as a rank, I'm just saying.
8136551	8140994	But it was... Star Trek Online was really good.
8141154	8141655	I liked it.
8141715	8145778	I mean, really all I did was hang out at Deep Space Nine and play Dabo.
8146478	8147239	Dabo with Lita.
8148340	8148560	So...
8150276	8151017	So there's that.
8151177	8165573	I mean, but unfortunately the reality is without that stuff to tie into and the fact that the video games unfortunately have been tanking, like it doesn't look good, which pains me because I love me some Trek and I would love to see like a really good video game happen.
8165614	8168497	And it's kind of irritating that that last one was such a stinker.
8169401	8183289	Actually, going back to Star Trek Online, I do suggest if this person has not played it to do so, because no matter which era of Star Trek you liked, and yeah, I really did not like Enterprise, but there are enough nods to the, even TOS characters show up.
8183810	8190534	Like, you actually do a time travel one and meet, you know, McCoy, and actually the model looks pretty much like he did.
8191074	8194196	So, I mean, it's really, really fun, I think.
8194216	8194456	Yeah.
8195077	8198020	If you like Star Trek, it's got enough nods that I think it would keep you interested.
8198861	8199061	Nice.
8201424	8205148	So, back to the email.
8205749	8208152	We have a kind of long one, but not terribly long, so I'll read it.
8208993	8210134	Hello there, OLR.
8210315	8210615	Hi.
8212497	8214139	I always feel the need to say hi back.
8214179	8214740	I'm friendly.
8215285	8216305	Yeah, you're friendly.
8216386	8217286	You're so friendly.
8218226	8223809	Well, last week I had a very, very unfortunate thing happen to me when looking for alternative digital distribution network.
8224529	8230531	Now, you guys know I'm not big on DRM, so I was really happy that GamersGate.com had a selection of DRM-free titles.
8231032	8234093	I bought a couple only to find out that the games weren't all they seemed.
8234373	8235153	Wait, who is this?
8235193	8237834	Because they say we make some assumptions about them in advance.
8237854	8239295	We're all still UT.
8239575	8240015	Ah, I see.
8240075	8240316	Okay.
8241056	8241236	Okay.
8241256	8241396	Okay.
8243613	8249218	Um, instead of giving me a full installer, I got very small files that pulled temporary files from the internet for installation.
8250059	8255644	As I would find out after perusing the site, you're not able to get full proper installers, even if you keep the temp files.
8255984	8258507	You can't install your game without an internet connection.
8258567	8259788	Needless to say, I was angry.
8260348	8263891	I shot off an email to GamersGate asking for a remedy for this issue.
8263951	8269555	Only be told, point blank, they only called them DRM-free because there were no serial numbers.
8270715	8279602	The person who emailed me back even had the gall to say that Steam and Origin weren't DRM and that theirs was an industry standard, despite my never having seen something like this before.
8280062	8284185	For the record, the Steam versions, you do get the full games downloaded, so that is a point.
8285986	8287806	I demanded my money back, but they refused to budge.
8287826	8291288	So now I'm left sending you an email and hoping to steer anyone else away from there.
8291348	8292789	You know, you do have the Better Business Bureau.
8293609	8295030	You can file an official complaint.
8295210	8297891	Especially if you feel like what you got wasn't what was advertised.
8298011	8301152	I think, you know, you do have a legit basis for a complaint there.
8301372	8301733	Exactly.
8301773	8305374	Especially since you messaged them first to remedy it.
8305794	8307075	Because you have to have taken that step.
8307443	8308344	And I'm going to be real.
8308844	8312886	This is Orange Lounge Radio, not a TV network or something.
8314087	8315427	We're a small group here.
8315547	8316568	We love our audience.
8316588	8318169	We love the small following that we have.
8318269	8327074	But this wouldn't really make waves the way that I think you really want this company to own up to what they're selling.
8328074	8329895	But I appreciate the heads up, nonetheless.
8330495	8332875	Seriously, I don't care what your attitude is towards DRM.
8333275	8337296	It's unacceptable for a company to say that something is DRM-free when it really isn't.
8338317	8344138	It's the most disgusting, dishonest thing I have ever experienced, and I wholeheartedly recommend people stay the hell away from gamersgate.com.
8344598	8347099	After all, if they're lying about this, what else are they lying about?
8347879	8349659	However, this is not a tale of total loss.
8349719	8353340	I emailed Robert Boyd of Zboyd Games and told him what happened.
8354000	8358841	He immediately sent me a desk or a copy of the game that I had bought, and they were actually DRM-free.
8359181	8362242	Moral of the story, avoid Gamersgate and thumbs up to Zboyd.
8362882	8364703	Still waiting on a response from Valusoft, though.
8364943	8365723	Well, that's my story.
8365803	8367523	Hope I've steered a few people away from Gamersgate.
8367563	8369644	If I've helped someone, the money I lost was worth it.
8369924	8370824	Sincerely, Ross Till, UT.
8371124	8373185	Kind of interesting way he went about doing it.
8373225	8377787	The second half of that email where he says, I emailed the people that made the game and said, did you know this?
8378807	8382748	But what's interesting to me is that he kind of breezed by the fact that he got the Desura code.
8382868	8384089	So why not?
8384249	8386010	Is Desura now your option of choice?
8386030	8388911	Because I know a lot of people are using Desura as a Steam alternative.
8388931	8393252	And even I've used it because one of our listeners was kind enough to gift me a game, but it was on Desura.
8393552	8395013	So I've used it and it's fine.
8395513	8400095	So is Desura like your happy alternative now that you found?
8400155	8400355	I don't...
8400775	8402337	I don't know if I really heard that part of it.
8402657	8411165	But I will say this in the email, in our chat room, live.vognetwork.com, Actdeft says, Gamersgate is a mess of a site.
8411465	8412506	I try not to buy from them.
8412586	8414188	So apparently, I've never heard of this site.
8414308	8415089	I have no opinion.
8415549	8416890	I can only go off what the listeners say.
8417151	8420574	And Ranma says to file a chargeback on your credit card.
8421445	8424847	Usually you want to do that as a last resort because that can come back to bite you.
8425007	8426568	I would say Better Business Bureau first.
8426608	8427168	Yes.
8428109	8434313	I do believe if I heard right, if you've done a chargeback, then the company themselves may actually file with a collection.
8434633	8434913	Right.
8435033	8436354	Which shows up on your credit report.
8436474	8436674	Right.
8436694	8437875	You've got to be careful with that stuff.
8438035	8438255	Yeah.
8439216	8444459	But no, I'd say... You don't want to burn your chargebacks because obviously the bank is going to take issue if you keep doing it.
8444839	8447320	I wouldn't want to burn it on something like this.
8447560	8449782	Use a chargeback when you really want to fuck somebody over.
8450760	8457127	My suggestion is have copies of all of the emails you've sent plus the responses dated.
8457528	8461912	Make sure they're date stamped and use those with your filing to the Better Business Bureau.
8461932	8463354	You know I got a free hamburger doing that once?
8466311	8467712	I got a free meal from this place.
8467732	8469653	And they didn't give you fries, the cheap bastards?
8469753	8470054	No, no, no.
8470094	8471315	I got sweet potato fries.
8471335	8471895	I got a whole meal.
8472175	8472415	Nice.
8472916	8476798	And they actually... We actually got to see them make the meal.
8477479	8479080	A free voucher for a meal for two.
8479780	8483603	Because I complained about the Strata place that's on Watt Avenue.
8484664	8487206	I used to work next door to them, so... Oh, I don't even know that place at all.
8487226	8489527	It's attached to like a Days Inn or something, but... Oh.
8490468	8492669	But it's a nice restaurant attached to a crappy hotel.
8492870	8493070	Huh.
8493590	8498973	But anyway, yeah, I can say for a fact that I've actually gotten something out of filing Better Business Bureau complaints, so.
8499633	8500974	And it was a pretty damn good hamburger, too.
8503054	8504515	That is a tasty burger.
8504555	8506296	Maybe Gamersgate will send you a hamburger.
8508777	8510358	We'll cross our fingers and our toes.
8511038	8512358	and then share with us.
8512578	8512798	Okay.
8514599	8515419	Last email, okay.
8515819	8516459	Hi, OLR.
8516519	8517400	It's Reginator.
8518000	8518240	Again.
8519220	8521400	I just had a question about computer OSs.
8521781	8523281	Currently, I'm on my laptop.
8523881	8528122	No, currently on my laptop, I have Windows 7 Home Premium installed, which overall I'm happy with.
8528662	8531743	Now, the trouble is I am a supporter of Zune Xbox Video.
8531803	8539345	In order for me to continue buying content for it, either I have to replace my 360 that I sold off two years ago or upgrade to Windows 8.
8540305	8544446	Now the question is, is it possible to finagle things so I can keep Windows 7 and use Windows 8?
8544606	8548107	I don't know, like put Windows 8 on a USB drive or something?
8548487	8549327	How would I do that?
8549687	8555168	I never once did anything on a computer regarding an OS and I hate to either brick my PC, lose Windows 7, etc.
8555288	8556048	Thanks in advance.
8557188	8566450	I will tell you this, that Windows OS in both cases are very extraneous with the other stuff that they install with it.
8567671	8569851	Depending on how big your hard drive is, you could probably partition
8571075	8577678	Yeah, that's probably going to have to be the way you do it because you can dual boot your system, but I don't know why you'd really want to do that.
8577738	8579358	If you want to go to Windows 8, then just go to Windows 8.
8580139	8583940	You know, if you need to see the new movies, which I think is kind of a dick move on Microsoft's part.
8584040	8590583	I don't want to go to Windows 8, but I know that when I rebuild my computer, I'm basically going to put Windows 7 on it no matter what it comes with.
8591743	8620673	well don't forget 8.1 is out now I haven't used that myself there's stuff that make it like a lot more usable like you know so it's more like 7 and Windows 8 overall is more stable than Windows 7 it's just all the crap that they throw in the front there that you have to dig through and stuff's kind of moved around see at this point I'm ready just to go back to Linux Mint and Runwine for my other programs I mean they've now got most of the game drivers and everything compatible with Linux
8621013	8624835	Comments from our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com Ranma says, you don't need to upgrade to 8.
8625536	8628117	SGO100Matt says, dual boot if you want, but there's no need for 8.
8628978	8630699	Brad from PodCulture says, just go to 8.
8631099	8632700	It runs everything from 7 just fine.
8633060	8637723	And then Bobby Blackwolf says, this is a tech support question, not a podcast email question.
8638123	8640425	Well, I'm wondering, because he said the USB boot thing.
8640445	8644207	I'm wondering if he didn't think of that, because we were talking about it with Linux a couple weeks ago.
8645408	8647969	I don't know that Windows 8 will live boot.
8648049	8650071	You can't do a Windows boot like that, I'm pretty sure, yeah.
8650991	8659899	Although I have done a USB installer for Windows for... Fuck, what was it called?
8659919	8660220	Netbook.
8661201	8663643	I have made an installer, so I don't know.
8664534	8665255	Is that it for emails?
8665475	8666175	Yeah, that's it.
8666195	8666455	All right.
8666495	8667976	Give DarkSakura more work next week.
8668096	8671278	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com Send me a Ricola.
8671398	8672339	We need like essays.
8672979	8673600	No.
8674060	8674780	Ross, steal you tea.
8674800	8675661	I want five emails.
8675721	8676542	No.
8676562	8676942	I'm kidding.
8676962	8677302	I'm kidding.
8677942	8678283	All right.
8678443	8679463	No, I want one.
8679744	8680024	All right.
8680184	8680544	One.
8680704	8681565	Let's get to the FUs.
8681665	8682205	Short one.
8682745	8684667	Let's get to the FUs of the week.
8685087	8685867	FU to emails.
8686988	8687168	No.
8702301	8704022	Here's the part of the show where we get angsty.
8704143	8704503	Why?
8704743	8705444	Because we can.
8707205	8710488	Um, F you to all the people who are driving 10 miles under the speed limit.
8710528	8712990	And I mean, it was like 5 fucking people driving 30 in a 40.
8713030	8715992	And I was like, really people?
8716212	8718854	Don't you know what a speed limit is and how to, you know, use it?
8718995	8720196	Flow of traffic, hello.
8720856	8721677	And the, um...
8723325	8724166	and DarkSakura.com
8745237	8746938	How do you de-escalate a customer?
8747238	8748078	De-escalate a customer?
8748318	8750299	Well, if they're yelling and cursing at me, I give them a timeout.
8751319	8751719	It works.
8751899	8752279	Seriously.
8752519	8753700	We weren't allowed to hang up on people.
8754680	8758221	So if it was like, I want my payoff!
8758261	8760201	I'd be like, no, I'm sorry.
8760401	8768784	We need to have this conversation like civil adults, so I'm going to put you on hold for two minutes, let you calm down a little bit so we can come back and discuss this like adults.
8770834	8771174	You know what?
8771194	8773316	They'd either hang up on me or they would come back and be nice.
8776538	8777499	That'll get you a job.
8778580	8779020	You know what?
8779160	8779701	It works.
8780922	8785485	And the thing is, they can't complain about it because I did nothing uncivil.
8786746	8787827	She's got great attendance.
8787867	8789608	She's shown up to most of these shows.
8790269	8791630	Unless I was, like, dead sick.
8791650	8792130	No, I know it.
8792768	8794290	I even came here sick a few times.
8794510	8795031	Watch it.
8795331	8796012	All right, Loki.
8797354	8802219	F you to Wingstop because why does it take 30 minutes for you to make wings for us?
8802900	8804722	I mean, 30 minutes?
8805423	8805824	Seriously?
8806144	8808467	You fry the wings, you dip them in sauce.
8808927	8809288	Done.
8809568	8810749	Wastop is fucking good though.
8811210	8811870	They're not that great.
8811890	8814112	That's not an endorsement.
8814473	8816915	If I want food that will make me fat, that's what I want.
8816935	8828205	Because if I can go to KFC and get the wings dipped in sauce within the time that I order in the drive-thru and pull up to the window, it should not take 30 fucking minutes to cook wings.
8829586	8830167	I'm sorry.
8831808	8833210	Don't fry wings for 30 minutes.
8835126	8836607	Oh, and their fries fucking sucked.
8836687	8839669	They were soggy, stale, unsalted.
8840029	8847813	It was just like some crapped potato into a little cardboard tray and tried to pass it off as french fries.
8847893	8849234	It was just not good.
8849594	8853156	Ranma in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com suggesting buffalo wild wings.
8853556	8855377	Here we go, the food show again.
8855437	8856797	Orange Lounge Foodio.
8857177	8858497	Nelly wanted to try Wingstop.
8858658	8860638	Even though I've been there and said, listen, it sucks.
8860938	8862299	You know, we shouldn't go back.
8862319	8863499	Take her to Hooters next time.
8863539	8868200	Although I did get to try for the first time actually going inside and doing one of those Coke freestyle machines.
8868300	8870721	Those are pretty awesome.
8870961	8872402	She says, we should go in these for our home.
8872422	8873302	I'm like, yes, we should.
8874663	8875903	That's a project you should work on.
8876144	8876764	Building your own.
8877384	8878805	Oh yeah, that's expensive.
8879286	8880627	Dispense the Tehrani syrup.
8880687	8881127	Think about it.
8882248	8883028	Here's your turn in Loki.
8883048	8888532	I'm going to give an FU to iMessage because we all know they're already having some type of bug.
8888992	8892334	And I've been trying to text message during the show and I think iMessage has stopped working.
8892875	8894036	And I don't know what the hell is going on.
8894056	8896177	But then one of my other friends sent me a text and I got it fine.
8897297	8898817	I'm afraid I can't let you do that.
8898837	8901118	iMessage is my FU of the week.
8901998	8907039	And yes, I'm an Apple sheep and I have an iPhone, but I just want to text message people, okay?
8908199	8909719	You can't text message break up.
8910099	8910319	What?
8912840	8914620	Did you just quote a Kelly song over there?
8914640	8914920	I did.
8915420	8915800	Alright.
8917041	8921041	Just a couple more stories and then Twitter topics and the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
8921061	8921441	First, Loki.
8924762	8931347	All right, so there's a new Kickstarter for a new augmented reality glass thing.
8931888	8934070	It's done by some ex-Valve employees.
8936352	8938854	I guess they've reached their goal already, but they're doing their stretch goals.
8939314	8950143	What's kind of unique about it is it's these shutter glasses, and they actually have projectors, so it projects 3D images onto the environment.
8950583	8964042	The only thing, though, that seemed kind of weird, though, is, like, in the video and stuff, it just didn't seem like, I mean, if you're moving your head and stuff, wouldn't that projector, you know, the projection kind of change where it's at, unless it's updating really fast?
8964683	8964963	I don't know.
8966403	8966663	I don't know.
8966823	8967264	Interesting.
8967464	8969046	Don't know what the price point of it is.
8970387	8974210	Certainly I'm not going to back it because I don't need to spend money on this kind of crap.
8975251	8976272	But you kind of want to.
8977513	8980316	No, because it's not expected to come out for like a year.
8981157	8982198	A starter package is $189.
8982618	8986021	And you get a cast AR.
8986301	8987403	Oh, that's the weird thing about it.
8987523	8989905	You have to have this thing that it actually casts onto.
8989925	8990165	It's like a...
8992267	8995291	Looks like a fabric thing, almost like a green screen, but it's gray.
8996072	8999455	So it seems like a lot of hassle.
9000316	9002319	But hey, maybe if it's cheaper, then...
9004184	9019297	I don't know, the Oculus Rift it might be I think the Rift sounds more interesting because it's VR whereas this is augmented reality stuff and just I don't really care about AR stuff I remember trying to pull that shit off with the Vita and it sucked Remember the Vita with the AR?
9019998	9024962	It's like, oh, let me try this soccer game Wow, that's shit Okay, cool
9025618	9025918	Alright.
9027419	9028280	One more story for you guys.
9028320	9033824	I swear, it's like blast from OLR's past tonight, and I guess Jason kind of referenced that in the intro tonight.
9033924	9040509	It's kind of true, because we have one more story here tonight, and it's about one of our favorite DDR knockoffs they ever had.
9041713	9042233	Thanks for watching!
9061898	9064900	and B, it was the kind of thing that they would just take to Burning Man.
9065201	9069444	And that type of artsy stuff, that's what you expect to see at Burning Man, that weird stuff.
9070645	9079251	Also, there were some other festivals Dance Dance Himalayan went to, including the Fine Arts Festival, a Denmark thing called Smuckfest, which...
9079531	9080392	DDR for hipsters.
9080592	9081112	Yeah, I guess.
9081132	9081372	I don't know.
9081672	9094100	But anyway, the game was officially retired at Burning Man 2013, and then the display was ripped apart, and then in true Burning Man, what the fuck are they even doing anymore fashion?
9094140	9104786	And look, I have friends that go to Burning Man and love it and swear by it, and I'm not knocking it, but I'm just saying the randomness of some of this shit doesn't help the theories that everybody's on drugs there.
9104906	9105706	I'm just saying...
9106807	9107508	I'm just saying.
9107868	9109069	I've seen the hula hoop cams.
9109209	9109949	I'm just saying.
9110189	9116633	But anyhow, the way they destroyed it, what I meant to say is that they dropped a piano on it.
9117854	9120116	Actually, they dropped a piano on what was left.
9120156	9123898	And since I know DarkSakura is dying to see, here it is.
9128721	9130462	An old powder blue upright.
9130502	9131143	Yep, and then...
9133679	9135681	and all the people... I need to go to Burning Man, Rob.
9135781	9136923	It's just so fucking hard.
9137463	9137904	No.
9138404	9138824	No.
9140086	9140286	No.
9142148	9142708	I love you.
9142728	9146072	If you want to take drugs and run naked through the desert, I guess you can do that.
9146412	9153940	I love you, but sometimes little things make you pretty irritable and going to the desert...
9155120	9156701	for seven days.
9156941	9158262	I'd probably want to murder everybody.
9158462	9161604	Where you, like, I don't know where these people poop.
9163105	9163745	They have port-a-pots.
9163765	9164526	They have an RV.
9164606	9165866	I guess it's RVs or whatever.
9166206	9167127	They do have sanitation.
9167147	9168228	There's no such thing as money.
9168608	9169588	It's a barter system.
9170589	9174171	And just DarkSakura, I don't think you'd enjoy it.
9174671	9176552	In fact, I think you'd complain a little bit.
9176592	9177453	I probably wouldn't.
9178713	9193585	it's just every so often I want to go see some of this stuff in person and then you just reminded me no air conditioning fuck that shit I can't stand hot and I live in Sacramento what am I thinking well you're on drugs
9194105	9218114	and that's why I'm on the drugs that keep me from murdering people I'm on I just want to make it clear I'm just teasing I don't want to offend the people because I have friends that go to this and they have a great time and they always tell me I should go but I'm like my red-headed ass cannot handle seven days in the desert it's not gonna happen so I'll just what if you I will watch the YouTubes what if you went through the desert on a horse with no name
9222270	9223890	I don't even want to do this show anymore.
9224310	9224591	All right.
9225071	9225491	I'm just kidding.
9225551	9225771	Okay.
9226791	9228431	I do want to talk to you on Skype.
9228531	9230412	Maybe you'll have a better topic to talk about.
9230432	9233572	1-877-GAME-OLR Talk about Rob's redheaded ass.
9235613	9236573	Stop being weird.
9236933	9242294	Our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word if you want to give us a call.
9243355	9247816	Bobby Blackwolf is in our chat room saying, I go to Dragon Con instead of Burning Man.
9248116	9249316	They're at the same time.
9249696	9250997	And you know what?
9251357	9253818	And that's, I think, my new drug of choice, too.
9253958	9255419	I did really love DragonCon this year.
9255539	9256360	I can't wait to go back.
9256700	9261703	And you know how I can poke fun at myself, too, because I said, you know, everyone's on drugs at Burning Man.
9261943	9263344	Well, at DragonCon, everybody's drunk.
9263964	9265265	Everybody's drunk at DragonCon.
9265485	9268047	And I say that as a proud DragonCon attendee.
9268867	9272169	Responsibly, we're responsibly drunk, but I'm just saying.
9272209	9273950	Rob, next year, fun of me.
9275060	9276481	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9300228	9300768	They love you.
9300789	9302149	They like Loki, too.
9302209	9305570	I mean, at this point, it'd have to be under some kind of media thing for me.
9305671	9307491	You are the one that tried to make Lolo gay.
9307851	9308792	Let's be real.
9309712	9313054	Look, I can't help it if Lala is really a cross-dresser.
9313754	9314814	No, I'm kidding.
9315074	9316155	I don't know if you are listening to these shows.
9316375	9321277	I don't shout them out enough here on the program because, unfortunately, we don't really have a shout-out segment.
9321297	9324318	But I do want to give a shout-out to folks like GameBooey.
9324378	9325819	Well, you know them very well, right?
9325859	9325959	Yeah.
9326519	9327219	Koopa Club.
9327239	9328960	I don't know if you're listening to them, but they're a lot of fun.
9329280	9330041	They're out of Chicago.
9330281	9330881	You would love them.
9331341	9331802	Chicago.
9332002	9333062	Video game realness.
9333462	9333983	Canadian.
9334543	9335223	Hilarious.
9335624	9338365	They kind of do what we do here, where they're all at one table in one room.
9338385	9339626	And they should send us some poutine.
9343207	9346189	He was bitching about soggy fries from Wingstop earlier.
9346289	9349250	I do not want FedExed poutine to show up in here.
9349270	9351091	There's actually a place in town you can get poutine.
9352332	9353412	Game Bar is another one.
9353432	9353813	District Club.
9355171	9358154	No, it's an actual restaurant, not a strip club.
9358694	9358974	Alright.
9359255	9360796	I do not need... Oh, Poutine.
9360816	9361316	Oh, I'm sorry.
9363638	9365380	You're thinking of Poutine.
9367081	9367561	Shut up!
9369241	9373243	We did already have Kirby birth.
9373263	9376244	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
9376284	9378365	You need to call us or it's going to be the poutine hour.
9379786	9383528	And Loki may not give you what you think that is with the poutine hour.
9383928	9384108	What?
9388330	9391091	Or we could go to Last Minute Stories, Loki, while we wait for some calls.
9392215	9392736	Sure, why not?
9392796	9398160	Let's talk about Grand Theft Auto V. It's number two in Japan after debuting.
9398481	9399541	What was number one, though?
9399621	9400342	I'm kind of curious.
9400562	9401083	Oh, Pokemon.
9401883	9404105	Hey, wait, number two's not bad.
9404125	9405406	But Nintendo's going bankrupt, y'all.
9406227	9406607	They are.
9407248	9408869	They're going to have to do something about it.
9413213	9413433	Yeah.
9414253	9414634	That's it?
9414914	9415995	That's all I got.
9417878	9423242	There were some stories on... The Xbox One also is not going to support third-party headsets at launch.
9423703	9424003	Not until 2014.
9424043	9431588	There were some stories on Zelda this week that we didn't get to, and I don't remember what they were off the top of my head.
9431608	9432228	Does it involve poutine?
9433710	9434050	Yes.
9435211	9435491	Yes.
9436158	9453794	because poutine is the national food of Hyrule if you do the dungeons in a certain order you can actually collect the gravy and the cheese curd power up and go to town we have pianos dropping on DDR machines to set people on fire what?
9453894	9454935	I just haven't done that in a while
9457503	9457723	Actdeft.com.
9482455	9483496	That is actually true.
9484116	9490420	SSJ100, Matt, you misspelled P-O-U-T-I-N-E, poutine and dongles.
9491141	9491721	Those are like two.
9491881	9493582	You know another word that makes me giggle like that?
9494263	9494643	Balls.
9497405	9499066	I'm turning DarkSakura's mic off.
9499546	9500146	Oh, thank God.
9500166	9500907	We're getting a call.
9501087	9502728	Thank the Lord.
9502808	9504569	Somebody's going to help us talk about something.
9505190	9506290	Maybe Canadian, maybe not.
9506350	9506671	I don't know.
9506931	9507811	Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio.
9507831	9508132	Who's this?
9508812	9509713	Hey, this is Zappy.
9509833	9510694	Hey, Zappy, how you doing?
9510714	9511574	I officially endorse poutine.
9511935	9512395	What's that?
9513155	9514517	I officially endorse poutine.
9514977	9515677	Are you Canadian?
9516538	9520962	Yep, even though I come from French Canada, so it's really... I love poutine so much.
9521002	9521902	God damn it!
9522763	9525205	And I haven't had it since Louisiana.
9525345	9526586	All right, Zappy, have a great night.
9526626	9527647	No, I'm just kidding.
9528247	9530409	What did you call in to talk to us about tonight, Zappy?
9531190	9535613	Well, besides poutine, I was going to talk about me playing the Xbox One this week.
9536654	9536974	Why?
9537034	9537655	How did that happen?
9538376	9543039	Well, I just went to my local Best Buy and lo and behold, they just had like an Xbox One demo out.
9543519	9552725	I went into my local Best Buy and like I had to ask to get a copy of Pokemon Y. Like, may I buy a copy of Pokemon because I don't see it on the shelf.
9553165	9555226	I didn't see no Xbox Ones or PlayStations.
9555487	9557448	Apparently, they got their shit together in Canada.
9557748	9558348	You know why?
9558649	9561350	Everyone's happy because they're eating french fries smothered in gravy.
9561590	9563011	And cheese curds.
9563431	9565553	Well, I hate to break it to you, but they had no Pokemon.
9566233	9566353	Oh.
9567253	9567674	Sold out.
9567834	9568234	I'm just kidding.
9568254	9568474	All right.
9569234	9572215	We're moving to Canada tomorrow, by the way.
9572335	9575696	Wait, is that why you went there, Zappy, to get Pokemon and you ended up with Xbox One?
9576336	9579437	Well, I was going to go get the Pokemon from my boyfriend and no.
9579777	9580217	Oh, okay.
9580317	9580557	All right.
9580857	9584979	Well, how was Xbox One?
9584999	9585479	What did you play?
9586497	9587257	They had Forza 5.
9587597	9589418	Oh, okay, cool.
9589978	9594379	I'll say this, it's very pretty, but there's one thing that really has me concerned.
9595280	9601821	They had this demo unit that looked like a complete factory-finished Xbox, and the game was stuttering like no tomorrow.
9603122	9603662	Really?
9604426	9609229	It's because it's not actually, it's just the PC and the units.
9609389	9613092	I don't think it's actually, well actually it's the test units I think.
9613412	9616093	Yeah, they had like a clear container for it.
9616194	9618115	It looked like a finished Xbox One.
9618315	9620136	But it's probably not a finished version of the game.
9620196	9622377	Remember, Forza 5 isn't done yet.
9622458	9624799	They need to patch in the rest of the game when it comes out.
9624839	9626280	We're only a month out too.
9626340	9629182	I mean, I would think that the real deal is starting to show up.
9629562	9636045	But this is the copy that they were confident enough to bring to a retail store and have people try out.
9636725	9656133	And funny enough, I was teasing Bobby Blackwolf because he has the show before us here at VOG Network and I was teasing him earlier because he was talking about demos and I said, well, you know, Bobby, he will make his impression off a video game based off the demo and that's that because I think back to Ni No Kuni and how he refuses to play that full game because the demo was so awful, which it was, but the game's really good.
9656573	9656673	And
9657213	9665498	I bring that up because if you're going to make your impressions off this in-store demo unit, then yeah, it should run a little better than being stuttery all over the place.
9667079	9669120	Besides that, it was very pretty.
9669320	9670581	The controller is really awesome.
9670621	9671361	I want one of those.
9672202	9673843	And it plays like Forza.
9674583	9679106	Yeah, but more like the old Forzas and not like Forza Horizon Arcade-y, right?
9679497	9687823	No, no, it's like the numbered Forza games There you go, okay, fair enough Were they showing anything else, like Killer Instinct or any of that, or just Forza?
9688403	9702853	Nope, it was a Forza show I see They had two reps, they probably trained over the weekend showing it off Fair enough, fair enough I was going to say though, since we were talking about Pokemon a minute ago Have you tried playing the Pokemon in 3D?
9702993	9706956	It kind of stutters too Oh yeah Yeah, that was a little bit disappointing
9707199	9708620	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9732079	9733619	DarkSakura, what the hell are you doing in chat?
9733659	9734180	I don't know.
9734220	9737420	I tried to put one stupid little link and the whole thing copied.
9738040	9740641	And DarkSakura got kicked for flooding the chat.
9740701	9741441	You know what?
9742161	9743562	She was speaking in tongues.
9745822	9747803	That was actually a complete and total accident.
9748243	9748603	Whoops.
9748803	9749143	All right.
9749383	9750303	Good job, DarkSakura.
9750363	9750583	Okay.
9750923	9751604	Sorry, Zappy.
9752204	9757045	Well, the thing is, sure, 3D isn't that useful, but this is what they sold the system on.
9757425	9761586	You have 3D games and it looks like they're moving away from the things they were selling their own system on.
9763316	9765697	Well, what's the verdict for you?
9765837	9768237	Are you on board with next-gen gaming?
9768277	9770498	Are you going to get an Xbox One or a PlayStation 4?
9771458	9782700	Well, I'm considering it just because I was able to pre-order an Xbox One for $100 off because I just used the staples to stack a whole bunch of coupons.
9784280	9787161	So you're going to go Xbox One with that money off then?
9787802	9791004	I'm thinking about it because $400 puts it at the same price as a PS4.
9791244	9791845	That's true.
9791905	9797829	If you can lessen the price, Xbox One does have some exclusives that are worth looking at.
9799510	9802011	Yeah, but on the other hand, the launch lineup just isn't there.
9802352	9803252	Yeah, I hear you.
9803713	9806655	And like Loki, he's waiting six months, so there's nothing wrong with that.
9807816	9809778	Alright, well Zappy, I'm going to let you go to see if anybody else calls.
9809798	9810419	But thanks for calling.
9810439	9813743	I don't think we've heard from you in forever and it's good to hear the impressions of the Xbox One.
9814404	9815165	Alright, cool.
9815405	9816426	Next time, pretty poutine.
9817327	9818048	Yep, with Smokey.
9818228	9818829	Alright, sounds good.
9818849	9820030	Bye.
9822244	9826166	1877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
9826186	9827046	I figured out what it did.
9827867	9831028	It actually copied the image data and not the URL.
9831809	9835450	I have no idea how that happened because I highlighted the URL to copy it.
9836411	9838592	So my iPad is currently the devil.
9840083	9844348	1-877-GAME-OLR or use your name on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
9844408	9845770	We need more poutine.
9846110	9848974	I'm trying to go to tweets and see what else has been tweeted at us tonight.
9848994	9850256	Someone new should call us.
9850336	9851217	I want new.
9851978	9855582	I mean, I love all of you people seriously and I love talking with you, but we need someone new calling.
9856123	9857184	New voices, new blood.
9858286	9871258	Actdeft sent us a tweet, but it's a tweet from Eurogamer about the extension of the games for gold on 360, which I think we had talked about earlier.
9871598	9874781	I was trying to see if there was more games announced on it, but I don't think so.
9874841	9878324	I didn't realize they got the exact same games in Europe, but I guess that makes sense that they do.
9879585	9883367	Um, Sterlok tweeted us saying, what was the music from tonight?
9883487	9884247	Very awesome.
9884547	9887608	Well, clearly you're talking about the song Always by Erasure.
9887928	9889329	It's what we played during the Fugle.
9889489	9891049	We need more Erasure on the show.
9891149	9891550	We do.
9891790	9892030	We did.
9892150	9892990	I can make that happen.
9893110	9894891	Don't, uh, don't think I won't.
9895411	9896631	I think that's it for Twitter topics.
9896672	9897692	I didn't get a whole lot tonight.
9897752	9899753	So twitter.com slash OLR.
9899933	9902354	We need a new ending song and it should be all through the years.
9903654	9903854	All right.
9903894	9907535	I'm going to put out one more call for phone calls and then we're going to wrap it up.
9907596	9908756	No, you should call tonight.
9909335	9909815	See y'all?
9910876	9911637	Do it now!
9911657	9916040	1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
9917100	9918962	And we're out of last minute stories, right?
9919582	9919882	Yeah.
9920222	9922444	Is there any more food stories somebody wants to tell?
9922564	9923385	Pool tea!
9924474	9929437	I think they have that actually over at Sprouts or even like Whole Foods or something like that.
9929457	9931137	They have like their weird food over there.
9931338	9932278	I could just make it at home.
9932938	9933038	Yeah.
9933078	9933979	Maybe I'm just thinking of the cheese first.
9933999	9935400	It's not that difficult if you think about it.
9935420	9937080	I say sacrifice your face first.
9937361	9937701	All right.
9937781	9938541	Degenerate Johnny.
9939021	9939362	All right.
9939382	9940702	Well, I guess nobody wants to call.
9940742	9941443	That makes me sad.
9941463	9944864	So I'm going to close up the Skype line and I will encourage you guys to email us in a future week.
9944904	9948927	Mailbag at OrangeLongTrader.com or you can also send us a tweet.
9948987	9953389	Twitter.com slash OLR and those are all the ways you can interact with us as well.
9954310	9957552	Otherwise, that does it for another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
9957893	9960275	I just want to say thank you guys very much for listening to the show.
9961416	9965339	The nominating stuff is over for the podcast awards, but I do want to give a quick thank you.
9965359	9972606	If you did take the time out of your day to nominate us, or at least nominate another deserving independent podcast, even if it wasn't us, I want to say thank you.
9973607	9977971	We'll know the results of that, I think it's the same time as this show next week, so that could be interesting.
9978311	9982313	So we can have our disappointment drinks when we don't get nominated.
9982333	9984893	We'll have a pile of poutine that will drown our sorrows in.
9985033	9986554	Yes, fist bump.
9986614	9987174	Poutine.
9988615	9989995	Do you want some poutine, Loki?
9990175	9990335	No.
9990595	9991456	Is that part of your diet?
9992116	9992636	Poutine.
9992796	9993276	You know what?
9993417	9993957	Budget for it.
9994037	9996638	I don't think that there's a ketogenic version of poutine.
9996658	9997398	Just budget for it.
9997418	9998038	That's all you have to do.
9998058	9998658	All right.
10000379	10001040	Thank you very much.
10022103	10027551	You can also leave us a nice review on iTunes, Stitcher, Thumbs Up, you know, all the places where you found this podcast.
10027872	10029274	Other people will find podcasts too.
10030155	10032098	It's time to go around and get everybody's final thought.
10032438	10034181	Loki, starting us off tonight, your final thought.
10035167	10059849	well we'll be playing more Grand Theft Auto this week and hopefully you should see an announcement about the next game night we'll maybe do another game night or maybe we'll do like one week because Friday seems to be a lot better for people because it's hard to play so maybe we'll do another game night Friday and then we'll switch it up to the next platform the next Friday or something like that switch off until some other games come out
10061028	10089561	um my final thought tonight is um I don't know uh I uh I need to get working on my Halloween costume because I haven't started yet and I really need to do that and I need to not slack off and also I need to do more live game streaming because I've been slacking off on that too so uh even though I was joking earlier about how everybody's live streaming oh well I'm gonna do it too uh because there's some other games out there I'm playing that I want to show you guys that aren't just Final Fantasy 14 believe it or not and last but not least DarkSakura your final thought tonight
10089761	10092322	The closest thing I have to cheese curds is cottage cheese.
10094003	10094623	That sucks.
10096023	10097564	Could you put cottage cheese on french fries?
10097984	10099605	I can't eat french fries.
10100845	10101906	You know what?
10103986	10107127	I feel healthier than I have in the last three weeks.
10108388	10109989	And I want to start playing DDR again.
10110189	10110969	That's my final thought.
10111559	10111919	All right.
10112119	10112460	Good luck.
10112480	10113420	I want to make it a thing.
10113760	10114261	A thing.
10114441	10114941	A thing.
10115061	10115541	Your thing.
10115601	10115922	All right.
10116362	10118964	Well, that's the end of this thing for tonight.
10119024	10122386	We'll be back next Sunday, seven days, to do it all over again.
10122446	10124847	Yet another thing just in time for Halloween with episode 525.
10125087	10129470	Multiple of 25 palindrome episode.
10130230	10132432	So we'll see you next time here on Orange Launch Radio.
10132452	10132732	Good night.
10133666	10134587	Thank you for watching.
10163647	10164708	See you next week!
