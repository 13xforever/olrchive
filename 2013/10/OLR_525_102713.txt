All this and more begins right now.
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
It is Orange Lounge Radio episode number 525, October the 27th, 2013.
My name is Rob Roberts here with all you guys to talk about video games and gaming culture and so on and so forth with my co-hosts.
First up, the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
Can't tell it pruning.
You can't be gardening.
You're in the kitchen slash studio right now.
Oh, Animal Crossing.
She's just like a witch.
Wow, you actually have a little witch's hat for your character.
Because I paid money for Gracie items.
Adorable.
I have the full store now.
Wow.
You are like really hardcore into this Animal Crossing stuff.
It's no joke.
I have two characters that are mine and I made one for Julian because I'm bribing him.
But I'll talk about that during my gaming week.
I'm at the gym, let's play Pokemon game
I will say the new one is like way there's just more excitement and it's just a better coat of paint or just something it really energizes that whole brand in a way I haven't felt in a very long time well Hanukkah is coming up so whatever ask Hanukkah Harry for one no alright
I like how you think.
And then telling me that the eight people, however many people before me, you know, I'm just, I don't want to go much too into the interview.
Sure, sure, sure.
Cross your fingers, cross your toes, light some candles, say a prayer, whatever.
I'm trying not to be excited, but I need a prayer circle, Rob.
All right, let's join hands.
Okay, joining us in our prayer circle this evening, say hello to Tech Master Loki.
Hi.
How you doing, Loki?
Doing all right.
Yeah?
I wanted to get better food for dinner other than McDonald's, but I was too busy looking for UFO parts in Grand Theft Auto.
Oh.
I was like, wait a minute, is that like a toy for Josh?
Oh, it's a Grand Theft Auto thing.
I will tell you this, Loki, I came so close to finally jumping on that Grand Theft Auto 5 bandwagon this week.
We were at Fry's or Best Buy or one of those stores, and I almost did it, but then I was like, wait, Rob, you have an unopened copy of Grand Theft Auto 4 sitting on your shelf.
This is not okay.
You can't get on the 5 bandwagon until you at least play some 4.
you can get on the five bandwagon just fine and then Alan is like although I mean it will look that much better but you know I still think you can get on the bandwagon without playing it for but Alan is like Alan is like why don't you just wait in like a year there'll be the steam sale it'll be six bucks on PC what do you I mean granted we don't really have a PC version confirmed but
We all know it'll probably happen at some point.
So, you know, he's encouraging me to wait.
But I'm like, everybody's playing it now.
They're having the VOG nights now.
It's fun.
You're missing out.
But I need to save my money for the PlayStation 4 and all the games that aren't coming out.
Happy Birthday to Actdeft
It's not his birthday, but we always are happy to have him here in studio joining us with the show.
Say hello, everybody.
It's his unbirthday.
So a merry unbirthday to VXJasonXV, or just Jason.
The other Mexican across the table, no less.
That's right.
How you doing?
Just not living in Mexico.
Quienes.
Jason is the new VO guy for basically VOG Network.
I mean, Bobby does some of the VOs, but you're slowly kind of taking over because since you don't have a show right now, you did have one for a while, right?
Not on a network, not affiliated, but I was doing a podcast with some friends for a while.
That was before VOG and all that, right?
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I have my microphone set up sitting nice and ready I love my studio studio slash office set up and I thought hey Rob can always use an extra hour on Sunday so this is probably a good idea
I like to think if the worst ever happened and OLR and Horde House were like both suddenly done which I don't even like to think about that but you know all things come to an end eventually nothing's on the radar yet folks I don't want to scare anybody but I like to think if these projects were to ever come to an end that's kind of like what I would want to do is it's like oh but that's like I've been doing this radio amateur stuff so long like I would have to do something for someone somewhere you know
But I like to think I could just start up another show somewhere, but maybe, I don't know, maybe in 10 years I would not really want to do that anymore and I'd just do VOs for somebody else.
And you have a ton of expertise that you can provide to someone else for the actual aspects of running a show.
Oh, inflate my ego more.
Producer, you know, producer, engineering, set up for streaming, recording.
Keep talking, you're my friend.
There's many, many ways to put together a show, live podcast or otherwise.
Everybody could be better and somebody with expertise could provide that.
Yeah.
Well, I couldn't do this every week and I don't think DarkSakura or Loki or even Jason could do this every week either if it weren't for the chatters.
And so hello to our chatroom, live.vognetwork.com and hello to the podcast listeners as well.
I don't want you guys to feel neglected.
We love everybody who participates with our show in one way or another.
But we do have the live chatters over at live.vognetwork.com.
Tiger Claw says, I wish Rob did the intro with the auto-tune.
I will say this.
We once were looking at doing a segment on the show that was Extifer sings the virtual console release dates.
Back when the Wii was newer and there was a virtual console every week.
Well, that was right when that app came out on iPhone that was like IMT Paint or whatever.
Mm-hmm.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Wow.
Which, spoiler alert, sucks ass.
But you can if you sort of try to sing, I guess, over it.
It sort of sounds auto-tuned.
I don't know.
You know what?
We both have Audition.
Mm-hmm.
All I need to do is sit down for an hour and I can probably figure out how to do it.
Well, yeah, no, no.
Now it's... I mean, keep in mind, this was five years ago.
We have new toys now that we didn't have five years ago.
But we also don't have Extifer as my roommate anymore.
So that idea is kind of long gone.
We have the internet.
We do.
We do.
But there's no virtual console.
Well, I guess Wii U virtual console games, but it's not... I remember when the Wii was first out, we were seeing virtual console games all the time.
It was like three a week.
And on Wii U...
They've been trickling through.
I feel like every week we're getting something, but let's be real.
It hasn't been a very strong lineup the past week or so.
Like, I think one week we got tennis and baseball.
And those were like the Nintendo versions, like very basic versions of those games.
The launch titles.
Yeah, part of the launch lineup.
I mean, they're basically named for crying out loud.
That tells you when they came out.
Yeah, exactly.
We could do the regular PlayStation Plus member awards thing.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
DarkSakura, if you would dive into the email bag and pull out the email that I licked.
The email that you licked?
Yes.
It has the saliva all over it.
While I multitask opening my village for everybody who wanted me to do it.
Animals can wait.
Yeah, they can.
I'm just being nice to people.
Hey, OLR crew, AZHP here.
I wanted to get something off my chest that's been bugging me for a few weeks now.
I had some friends over to play scary games a few weeks ago, and a lot of them were giving advice on how to play Amnesia.
Then I asked them if any wanted to play since they had played it before, and they said, Oh, I haven't played it before.
I watched a playthrough on YouTube.
This got me kind of bummed out because I feel some of the magic of experiencing the game together with friends was gone because they knew what was going to happen.
When I discovered that watching scary game playthroughs is actually way more common than I thought, some of the most popular videos of the game Outlast have millions of views.
Outlast is an indie game and certainly hasn't sold millions of copies, so prospects for a sequel are slim at this time.
So my question to you guys is, do you think streaming is hurting certain genres of games?
This is a slightly different discussion than Nintendo streaming kerfluffle that happened a few months ago.
Because Nintendo games are often games with excellent gameplay mechanics that makes you want to play, want to have your own experience with the game.
Even after, I'm about to get logged out, sorry.
Even after watching someone play it.
But is that necessarily the same for horror games?
After seeing the twists and scares, does that make you want to go out and play the game?
And to play Devil's Advocate, were these people just never going to play these games because they were too scared to play it by themselves?
I feel like with the easy answer being, let's watch a playthrough on YouTube, these people who watch the stream could have mustered up enough courage to get a friend or two over and play the game as they are huddled up with blankets over their heads, gripping each other in fear.
Is this something we may lose forever due to streaming?
I've rambled enough, but I'd love to hear your thoughts on the issue.
Keep up the great work.
Love always, AZHP.
This is a really good question, and that's why I wanted to pull it at the top of the show as a kickoff topic, because it's also timely with Halloween being this next week.
A lot of people are thinking about scary games, and I'm sure some of you, I don't know if you guys do this, or maybe people listening, but... We have to watch Showgirls.
Everybody has their tradition, and mine is watching Showgirls every Halloween, because it's a scary movie.
But I'm sure some of you bring people over, and y'all play Silent Hill, or y'all play Amnesia.
We've done that at your old place with Exifer.
Yeah.
Yeah, certainly.
But this is a really good question.
I mean, just in general, and it doesn't even necessarily have to be about streaming or about scary games, but is this new technology in this world that we live in as gamers where Twitch TV is getting more and more popular and all its knockoffs, is this hurting gaming more than we want to admit?
No, no one really watches it for the twists.
They watch it for the people reacting to playing the games.
It's really what it is.
Not me.
I don't really... I'm with you, because of course my mind is going to go to, if you listen to Horde House, you know our buddy Gemet over there is infamous for doing these playthroughs where he screams at the top of his lungs while playing Slenderman, and people love it.
They heat it up.
That's why it's so popular.
It's not really about the game itself, which, I mean, the game's good, but it's watching these over-the-top reactions, which is why people do it, right?
Right.
Yeah, I mean, I saw some footage of Amnesia before, I just don't remember it.
Well, I remember, and even though I've beaten the game a bajillion times, I watch playthroughs of Silent Hill 3, because that's my favorite game, and sometimes I don't feel like putting it in and playing through everything, I just want to watch all the cinematics.
You know?
for me it's more or less that I go back and re-watch scenes of games that I've already played like especially scenes that I really like the only game I think as far as scary games that I've done that with are pretty much games I don't intend to ever play
I want to see exactly how bad this is type of game.
I'm not as much into Resident Evil anymore, so I'll watch a playthrough of one of the Resident Evil games just to keep up on the story.
But I don't really want to play it.
For me, I don't care.
If someone was like, oh yeah, let's come over and have a bunch of people while we play through this and make fun of it.
That's where you get the fun.
Even if you've already seen it, as long as you're not spoiling it for people like your friends were spoiling it for you.
Then that's the difference.
People just need to have a little bit of respect.
If they know you haven't played through it before, they need to keep their big mouth shut.
I think the emailer brings up a good point, though, is that there are probably people out there where they're not sure if they want to buy a scary $10, $15 video game that's out there right now.
Let's say Outlast, I think was the example used in the email.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I kind of think it's a it's a decent argument now I sort of think though it's twofold I kind of think for every person you convince not to buy the game I think there's people you also convince to buy the game that may not have done so before so I think there is a little bit of both there's the bad news and there's good news that we might be neglecting here a little bit Jason you have any thoughts on this and I invite our chat room to respond to at live.vognetwork.com
I was basically going to say that I agree with what Loki said and that there's going to be a lot of people that are going to use this as an excuse to see a game without playing it, whether it's for saving money, whether it's for something that they just didn't get a chance to play.
but there's nothing wrong with that for the same exact point that you made in that somebody else can get turned on to this a game they didn't hear of a game they were on the fence for they see a tiny little bit of it it interests them they want to see the rest of the story around it and so forth
you know there's a lot of games that come out right now and nobody plays every single one of them so having something that kind of fills the void of being able to see what a game was get a story in a universe that you're interested in it's not a bad thing everybody does not play all of the same games question for you guys at the table have any of you been convinced to buy a video game because of a live stream I want to say I did I can't remember what it is
Yeah, well not because of a stream, but it showed a lot of the gameplay in a YouTube video.
That's how I bought Drunken Robot Pornography.
I mean, yeah, it was more of a review, but he played through like a good bit of what had been out, and I was like, heck yeah, I want this.
Just listening to the music made me want that game.
I've also picked up indie titles based on, you know, happened to going through Twitch and seeing people play, so.
Surgeon Simulator.
2013.
That video, I had to buy it after watching that.
I can't think of one off the top of my head that I bought, but I will say that seeing streams convinced me to give Dota 2 a try and League of Legends, and I was kind of ignoring those, but because of all the streaming that goes on with that, I was kind of convinced like, oh, maybe I can try this too.
That's actually exactly the same point.
The last time I was out here, I watched The International 3 with some coworkers, and once Dota 2 was finally available for Steam on Mac, I jumped on that and had a couple friends teach me how to play the game.
I don't want to say I'm good at it by any stretch of the imagination, but I'm to the point where I can actually learn on my own and sometimes hold up in multiplayer matches.
Going to our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com, SSJ100Matt says, I really just like watching my friends play games and occasionally do hilarious commentary.
AlanAlchemy with a comment that's teasing Gemet, which I'm always here for those.
AlanAlchemy says, and how Gemet takes his hands off the mouse and keyboard and slaps him over his face and stops playing the game when he hasn't even died yet.
It's hilarious and infuriating.
I'm going to get a nasty call on Skype this week.
God damn it, Rob Roberts.
I heard OLR this week, Rob Roberts, and you were talking shit about me again.
The other side of the coin from this email is party games because party games don't have something that you can spoil.
You see something live stream that's really fun and you pick it up immediately.
Good point.
Good point.
The first time I saw Mario U was on a live stream.
Because I didn't buy all that right when it first came out.
So I kind of saw it all like that morning.
Let's see.
Looking for more comments in our chat room.
DarkTetsuya at live.vognetwork.com says, To me it seems like the horror movie trailers or any trailer in general.
Sure, maybe you've seen some of the game, but there's still a good chunk that would surprise you.
BlackWolf, our good pal Bobby BlackWolf, who always does the show before us here at VOG Network, says, Well, I almost bought Final Fantasy XIV because of Sky's livestream.
And I'm interested in Hearthstone because of his livestream.
Interested and almost.
Actdeft actually said exactly the same thing that I wasn't even thinking about, is that you played Rogue Legacy, and I'll say this again once we hit our gaming weeks, but I've been playing a good chunk of that.
Every time I've seen that game, I've very much enjoyed it.
It's a good use of your time.
It's a great game.
Let me read another comment here, just a couple more.
Duran in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, I usually use demos or betas to decide if I want to play a game, but this is a nice way if those options aren't available.
It's a very good point.
and lastly I'll say from Dungeon Buster here I was on the fence with Amnesia a while back until I watched a few streams of it and picked it up so I mean a lot of positive like yes the streaming might be doing more good than bad not to dismiss the points of the original email though but I think there is a little bit of both I think there's some of what the emailer was saying and I think there's the other side of yeah but there's also another audience that may not have bought the game that is going to buy the game now
Yeah.
All right, anyhow, that'll do it for that topic.
Let's get into our gaming weeks.
For the record, I actually do totally want to have people in person for a good Silent Hill 3 playthrough.
It'll be fun.
Good times.
Actually, one comment I do need to respond to in chat.
Codeman says, Rob, have you played Outlast yet?
I have not.
Codeman was kind enough to gift me a copy.
I will say time is running out for me to do that, though, because Halloween is this week.
DarkSakura
You're not playing it right now.
No, not right now.
By the way, Normandy's open.
I played Final Fantasy XIV, and I got on a quest that was really pissing me off, so I just said screw it and got my second job.
So I'm at level 10 Thaumaturge, and when I hit 15, maybe tonight, I'll go back to spamming whatever I have to do as a sorcerer, maybe.
Not sorcerer, summoner, I guess.
I don't know how that works.
Anyway, so I'm playing that.
I got Gone Home, but I haven't started it yet.
Did I play some Super Mario 3D World Land?
Mm-hmm.
Whatever it is.
Oh yeah, that's right, because you borrowed that from me last year.
Yes, I did.
Whatever, 3D stuff.
Without the 3D.
I also played some Fractal, and I've played Mass Effect 3, I've played the first Mass Effect, because I bought Chadi the first two games on PC, and she hasn't been able to get hers to work.
I don't know why.
So I've been playing mine to walk her through getting all of her stuff set up.
And now that I'm in the game, I just can't resist rolling another Shepard.
I totally forgot where I was.
No, I have another Shepard that I'm playing as kind of the, let's see if we can get Garrus to go the specter path, which we know that doesn't really happen anyway, so whatever.
Spoilers!
But I'm playing that one, and I completely forgot where I was.
I haven't even done, like...
I think I just finished Novaria and that's it.
So I was playing those and I was playing something else.
Oh, Dan has broken out the GameCube and is playing the Mimish Cap.
Oh, nice.
He's like, we've had this game for how long?
And I've played it for not how long?
I'm going to play it.
So that's what all I've been hearing all morning is a mix of Animal Crossing music and the Mimish Cap.
Alrighty.
Yeah.
There it is, your gaming week.
Loki!
I only play Grand Theft Auto V. What a shock!
I know, shocking.
So, I've been still trying to go through single player and get 100%, so that's what I've been working on.
I finished the flight school stuff, even though I wanted to throw a controller when it came to some of the...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I can go in and it actually updates as I get stuff so I know, okay, I have to go here, I have to do this, because no one really wants to just wander the map looking for that shit.
I just want it done immediately so I can get on to the next thing.
And then playing a little bit of online at work, mostly the PlayStation 3 version, so I'm level 17 in that now.
And another VOG Gaming Night, I think we're going to
Take turns on the Fridays, so we'll probably have one next Friday around 8 o'clock.
Haven't decided if it's going to be PS3 or 360 yet.
Probably 360, so stay tuned for that.
And then, of course, the following week we'll probably do PS3.
All right.
So lots and lots of Grand Theft Auto 5.
And once again, if you want to join the VOG Club on Grand Theft Auto 5, all the information is in our forums at vognetwork.com.
Just click on forums at the top of the screen.
Yeah, socialclub.rockstargames.com.
And I think it's just slash crew slash vognetwork.
And I think last I checked, we had 46 people.
Nice.
And we now have...
50!
We hit 50.
Climbing.
Awesome.
Alright, Jason, our guest here and voiceover guy, what have you been up to?
This map is really freaking amazing.
I remember when I learned that it was impossible to 100% Just Cause 2, that it would have been really nice to have something that just shows us where all the items are.
When you get to like a 90-90% completion rate where running all over the continent is just ridiculous...
Oh yeah, I still have a few orbs I have to get in Crackdown, the first one.
Yeah, same problem.
Crackdown is even smaller than Just Cause 2 is, but still, yeah.
Something like that that helps you to the most monotonous grinding possible would be incredibly beneficial.
as I said earlier I've been playing a ton of Rogue Legacy and ripping my hair out with that collectively as well as FTL Faster Than Light which has been frustrating because even on easy I can't make it all the way across the galaxy and I've been very disappointed of this constantly I mentioned on Twitter last night that I went out to a friend's house down in San Francisco and I played Artemis the Starship Bridge Simulator for the first time we played for something like
Four hours, you gave me a glance.
Have you not heard of this before?
No, I have not, but it sounds interesting.
Artemis, I don't know what's new, what's old, but basically what it amounts to is that you have a starship, up to six of them, as a matter of fact.
You run either a server, or I think it's one server per ship, and you can have up to...
8 or 9 positions that encompass a starship bridge comms, helm, weapons, engineering, science that actually does like shield scanning and what not sector scanning and then obviously the captain is required I think you basically have to have at least 2 players but the more you have the better it is
and you start the game with a given scenario.
You have deep space stations, in our case DS1-4 to protect wormholes, space whales, minefields that you can use to your advantage or stop paying attention and destroy yourself very quickly.
It's an incredible amount of fun.
By the way, this game's getting a big response in our chatroom here at live.vognetwork.com.
BlackWolf says, I love Artemis.
Tim trips in chat and says, Artemis is so fun.
And SSJ100Matt says, Artemis is at PAX East, right?
I think it was.
I don't remember.
I didn't go, but I think it was one of those games.
I've seen a ton of footage and, you know, the places they can...
Take the main screen, the bridge screen and make it gigantic and have all of the stations situated strategically.
There's an immense amount of potential to take that game, make the experience as fun as possible and as good as you want it to be.
I am looking at footage of this game on YouTube that Bobby sent me.
How about that?
A Let's Play I'm using to look at the game.
So, yeah, this looks like they're having fun.
They're all kind of sitting around the table on all their little laptops yelling at each other.
That's cool.
and DarkSakura.
That sounds like a lot of fun.
It is so fun.
I gotta be honest, though.
If they were to slap Star Trek onto this, I know I shouldn't say that because this is an indie game and let it grow and be its own thing, but I have to say, can you imagine if they could slap Star Trek onto this?
It would basically be a Star Trek LARP.
People would so be there.
They've tried doing console Star Trek games that just did not take off.
With the intent of being a simulator.
Sure.
well even Ragenator wants to know in our chat room does it help to say engage or make it so or speak like Shatner when playing Artemis?
the captain did not did not take the role of a particular character from any universe like that but I would use those words because I was doing Helm and so we would have the rotation of the ship and you can also have a warp or a jump ship jump being you instantly go to a certain place of course and warp that progressively
HighRateTraveling.
He'll give me coordinates, and I will say locked in or coordinates engaged or jump engaged, 10 seconds to jump, all that kind of stuff.
We had fun with it, and it kind of comes with the territory of us all being the geeks that we are.
Of course.
We didn't take specific characters, but we had a hell of a lot of fun with it.
Tim Tripp in our chatroom says, I basically pretend it's Star Trek anyways.
Okay, it's not just me.
Revision 3 has a short little video of this game and they are all dressed up in Star Trek appropriate attire, uniforms and everything, color appropriate and the whole thing.
And I will say that our weapons individual was the space cowboy and he was playing that character very, very well.
Sorry, I'm just cracking up at chat because Tim Drip follows up with saying, Practice is my best Janeway voice, which Extifer over at Horde House does this so much better than I do.
But, you know, that's all Tom Paris, Harry Kim, Harry Kim, Tom Paris, Tom Paris.
That's all he does is yell those two names over and over, but it's funny.
I've been watching through Voyager.
Yeah, it was a good show.
It was underrated.
So, anyhow.
All right.
You know what?
What?
No, it wasn't.
Voyager was full of bad decision after bad decision and Janeway going fuck it I'm Janeway we're in the middle of Delta space I don't have to follow shit and that's the tale of Voyager I'm not asking for directions I am the direction it's a real trip though to see Janeway on Orange is the New Black I'm just saying it's a different role for her okay anyhow oh shit that was her I didn't even realize it after watching no it didn't even click
and there's also McCoy on some cops SWAT something I saw a commercial for obviously Avonverse McCoy is on some new TV show and that's quite a jump I love you GameGuru because you know SF Debris if you ever want to see the funniest mockery of the Janeway voice ever go to SF Debris
I was going to say, you know, Voyager had some pretty epic guest stars.
Like, Sarah Silverman was a guest star on an episode of Voyager.
And, like, she wasn't being her typical, like, you know, over-the-top hilarity.
Like, she was playing it serious.
So it's so funny to see her on the show.
You know, like...
I'm going on the Voyager, huh?
I just can't help but think always though of Maria Bamford doing her I used to work at the Star Trek experience as a Bajoran her Bajoran refugee voice I can never get that out of my head whenever I think of Star Trek
Bobby Blackwolf says, I hear Orange is the new Black is better if you pretend it's just Janeway in the holodeck.
It could be your fantasy.
Alright, look.
This is getting way too far away from video games.
Way too far.
It's just the expanse of the Star Trek universe.
Look what this Artemis game does to people.
Alright, I'm kidding.
I think we've also just admitted that we know way too much about Voyager than we should say in public.
I know nothing about Voyager other than you know
I will, however, watch an entire season of Voyager before I watch any more Enterprise.
There you go.
You know, true story, the first time I ever got drunk was at the Star Trek experience.
First time in my life I ever got drunk was at Warped Core Breach.
I love those things.
Fucking Travis over at Under Sedation Live here at VOG Network has the voicemail thing.
Anyway, long story that I'm not going to recap.
By the way, I did find in Las Vegas a replacement for the Warp Core Breach.
Oh, what's that?
It's at this place at the Paris Casino.
Their little dessert bar, whatever place, has fuzzy drinks with foam coming up out of it like the Warp Core Breach.
And whatever their red one is tastes like a Warp Core Breach.
Nice.
I just don't remember what it was called.
It was red and I was drunk.
Nice.
I gotta go to Vegas one of these times.
A friend of mine is trying to talk me into going to New Media Expo, which I think is right around the time of CES.
So it's like, oh, if I could do a double and do both those cons, it'd be a lot of fun.
But anyway, let's talk about my gaming week and the type of stuff that I've been playing this week.
Which, you know, much like Loki, I still have been playing plenty of Final Fantasy XIV.
We perfected earlier today speedruns of Wanderer's Palace, which if you know the endgame, that's one of the instances that you can do in the endgame.
Hotline Miami
Thanks for watching!
DarkSakura, Luke,
Very fast-paced game, and in the retro sense, I find a lot of it is about memorization.
Like, okay, here, you're going to go onto this floor in this house that you're invading for whatever reason, and I'm going to go kill that guy, and I'm going to take his weapon, and then go kill that guy, and that guy, and then I've got to run over here and lure that guy out.
You start to think of the memorization like it's a Mega Man level or something, like in retro.
I know it's a lot of trial and error, but unfortunately for me, I tend to error a lot more
Then I do succeed.
But it's something about the soundtrack of that game kind of like gets you going.
Yeah, I want to play more of that.
So I was having a lot of fun with that on PlayStation 3.
So again, if you have PlayStation Plus, check it out.
It's free.
You really have no reason at this point.
Not two.
And even, I'm sure it'll be discounted on Steam, and I don't think it's a very expensive game to begin with on any of the platforms it's on, so it's worth the money if you like old retro puzzle memorization games, and if you like an abundance of violence with your retro games, because I will tell you, there's an abundance of violence in this game.
and Shooting Dogs Alan Alchemy in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com backing us up, it absolutely needs memorization to get through it alright, let's see other games that I've been playing this week I did play a game it's not a new game, but it's new to me it's called Midway Arcade Origins which is a retro game collection that's available, I think it's on 360 and PS3, don't know about Wii or Wii U, I don't think it's there, I think it's only on the others
Here's the thing.
The Midway game collection's kind of been done before.
And I actually rented this.
I didn't buy it.
Because I was a little hesitant to buy it because, well, I already have Midway Arcade Treasures on PlayStation 2.
Like, there's three different volumes of it, right?
I have all three volumes.
So most of the games in this I already have in one way or another.
and I think they even had on the PlayStation 1 some of these games were available and it's kind of funny because some of these games we've seen before this generation Joust was an early $5 Xbox Live Arcade game and that's in the collection now for you know what you can probably find this for $19.99 on Amazon at this point or Gaming Stories buy this new
DarkSakura.com
Maybe.
Maybe.
Maybe.
Just like Punch-Out isn't Mike Tyson anymore.
Exactly.
They gave him a mustache and just photoshopped his name out so now it's just super off-road or whatever.
But I had a lot of fun playing that game.
Although I will say it loses a little something when you don't have the steering wheel that you can just spin around uncontrollably.
Remember, like, they were totally fake steering wheels, and they had no stop on the left or the right side, so when you were a kid, you would just spin that thing like crazy when you're trying to turn around, and it was a lot of fun.
It doesn't translate the same way to the, you know, thumbsticks, but it's an awful lot of fun to kind of have that whole experience, because I don't remember an arcade-perfect version of that.
I know on the NES they had a version of that, but it was a little...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
DarkTetsuya and GameGuru both in our chatroom telling me that Midway Treasures 3 actually did have Super Off-Road in it.
I just don't remember that, and to be honest, I'm looking over at my collection, I actually have Midway Arcade Treasures 1 and 2, so I guess I never picked up 3.
3 had Hydro Thunder, and it was all racing games, right?
I wonder why I skipped that one.
I remember having to seek out 3 on the PS2 for a very specific purpose, and I don't think it was off-road, but I know there was some other game that I wanted in it.
So anyway, as far as retro classic game collections go, it's fine.
Especially if you don't have these games already in one way or the other.
It's kind of neat to have them again.
And yeah, they've got the leaderboard and the trophies.
That's that.
Otherwise, not a lot to scream about.
But if you're a retro gaming fan, it's really nice to see them in the crisp HD.
And you can put different filters on the graphics too.
You can have it super sharp or smooth.
So you can do those little things.
and you know especially now that the title is a budget title it's it would be worth your time if you like retro games anyhow that does it for my gaming week so let's quickly do some housekeeping don't forget you can add us on twitter twitter.com slash olr and we're also on facebook facebook.com slash orange lounge radio we appreciate all our friends on those sites we're also on google plus as we'll get to later in the show
and I do want to remind you guys I mentioned this last week and just want to remind you guys there will be no new show in two weeks we will have the night off so we'll be here next week on November 3rd if I'm thinking right with the dates but we will not be here on November 10th because I will be coming back from Los Angeles and my not BlizzCon trip
and I get to trash your house.
DarkSakura will be house sitting and kitty sitting.
I got paid in Duffy.
Yes, as she kindly offered to do.
I would have done it for free.
I know.
Thanks for the Duffy.
You're welcome.
I've been sitting on that for like three months.
Ow!
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
So I said, fine, I'll go to BlizzCon, except there's no way I can get a ticket now.
BlizzCon is a fortress to get in as media.
You're either on their list or you're not.
So I'm just going to go to the parties and then go to Disneyland, which is BlizzCon enough, right?
Yeah.
Discon.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I'm gonna be at an event called World of Podcasts which is Thursday night I'll be there I'm not featured because again I wasn't planning on going so I missed the boat on all that stuff but Grandpa from our show is on one of the panels over there so yeah I'll be at World of Podcasts so if you're gonna be there come say hi
and say hi to Grandpa as well and then I don't know whatever else I get invited to Friday or Saturday we'll go to that too although Alan and I are going to try to do a Carthay Circle dinner one of those nights so probably Saturday night because I think that's when the closing ceremonies are so there's usually not a lot going around because they usually have a big old concert although they didn't announce any like big there's no like Ozzy Osbourne or anything this year so I don't know what they're doing for the closing ceremonies it's got to be a secret so all right it's a secret to everybody it is a secret to everybody
Alright, let's move on with some gaming news.
And Loki, gonna start us off tonight.
All right, there's a rumor that's, I guess, going on saying that there's going to be a brand new... Sorry, you know it's a slow gaming week when we have to start off, or a slow news week in gaming when we have to start off with a rumor.
So I apologize in advance, but it's not the best week in news.
There's nothing to talk about.
We're stretching tonight.
Fully admitting.
Fully admitting.
Like, listen, I'm not covering that story about, you know, NASCAR being, you know, the rights for NASCAR going to Deep Silver because no one fucking cares.
I know there's Ragnar out there who still has his gaming console that he stole.
So there's this series that I guess they're calling Reimagined because that's dumb.
Um, it's supposed to be, I guess, seven Nintendo 64 games that are being redone in HD.
And, God, I hope they're really actually redoing everything if they're actually going to do this and not just up-resing them because it's going to look like shit.
It's also going to look weird too because they're not going to be all fuzzy and cloudy anymore.
They're also saying that all seven games would feature new content and retail at $30.
The idea is Nintendo would be filling the gaps in their Wii U lineup by re-releasing older Nintendo 64 games.
here's kind of funny part though about that is they are already filling well I should say their lineup is already including older games that are being remade like Wind Waker HD for example or you know even before the Wii U they had their new play control games which they literally did nothing to except for change the control on it you know oh hey now it uses a Wii remote instead of you know GameCube controller because that's so much better it's not
And yeah, one of the rumors, of course, is that Mario 64 is going to be the first game.
Of course, it's going to be Mario 64.
They're not going to do Superman 64.
Hey, let's leave with that.
Mario Kart 64 would cannibalize a little bit of Mario Kart 8.
I don't think... I mean, I could see them doing something like this, but I would think of anything...
I just don't know how much of a draw there's really going to be for people to get HD versions of these games I'm sure some people will be interested in but I don't know I would think they'd be better off just doing like I could see this maybe for the 3DS because remember they did this with Ocarina and Star Fox and that kind of stuff I could see that happening but
I don't know.
It just sounds like a rumor to me.
Whatever.
Well, I realize it's a big old rumor, and Nintendo remaking their games wouldn't exactly be out of character for them or whatever, right?
I know, yeah.
But it seems like it's not a very long process for them, and the games turn out pretty well received.
I'm thinking of the Zelda or Wind Waker HD 30s.
Yeah, but the problem with Wind Waker HD, though, is that it had way better graphics than, you know, the GameCube... Well, because it was a GameCube game.
It wasn't that different than, you know, a regular Wii game or something like that.
So it wasn't... They weren't doing a whole lot.
Whereas if you were doing Mario or like any of the Nintendo 64 stuff, you're going to have to do quite a bit to that to make it look nice.
Because just up-resing it and making the polys look nicer and stuff...
It's gonna look like, I mean, fuck, you can just pull it up on YouTube and look at any of the emulators out there that do any sort of upscaling on that stuff, and it just, it doesn't look that good.
Like, even when I ran stuff in, like, an emulator on, like, the Ouya and stuff, and that sort of did some uprising and stuff, it just doesn't look good on your TV, because, yeah, everything's smoother looking, but it's just so empty, because those games, you know, couldn't, they couldn't do very far draw distances, or, you know, they didn't have a lot of detail in there, because...
It couldn't handle it.
It's just, I don't know.
It's a neat idea, but I just don't know how well it's going to look.
We'll see, I guess.
SSJ100Matt with a comment in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com The recent Mario Kart games have had the older tracks remade into the new games.
That's another good reason why Mario Kart 64 would be a little redundant.
Yeah, you know, as much as I like playing the older tracks, I think that's such a cop-out of like, hey, look, we can double the content now without having to do anything.
I do think they could release a bunch of old tracks as DLC.
I think that would be really cool.
Why not?
Why not have the balls and put a fucking track editor in there?
Oh, you afraid that people are going to come up with better track designs than your own?
But Loki, somebody might draw a penis as a track.
Not me.
I've decided I know what track I would design.
Boobs.
No, even better.
What?
I would have the full-on vag track.
You know, with a little loop.
See, I knew you were dirtying it up somewhere.
Oh, come on.
I think it's totally unfair to automatically assume that people are going to put a penis in when it is much better to put a vag in.
My next guess was boobs.
I'll tell you why.
I'll tell you why it's easy for people to put a penis in there.
Because who is the demographic for these games?
Teenage boys and pre-pubescent boys.
What have they seen?
They've seen their penis.
What have they not seen?
They have not seen a vagina.
And this would be the only way they ever would.
I would be doing them a favor.
It's familiar territory.
You didn't see fucking Bob Ross painting buildings and cars.
You saw him painting trees because that's what he knew.
He knew trees.
Just like kids, they know penises.
If you want to be technical, it had to do with his painting style, but that's a different thing.
Goddammit, I want to see a fuzzy fucking building.
He can do it.
From the grave.
I approve of this.
It will officially be called the Vulva Vroom.
Coach Buzzcut.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Kick me in the jibby So is that like, you know, like Mario teaches typing, it's Birdo teaches sex ed or something like that?
Teaching, this is all the stuff that I didn't want and I had it changed So you could even have it on the Wii U You could be like, now touch where you're gonna find the G spot And then the person touches, no, this is why you'll never get laid
show me on the touchpad where they touched you you get the orgasm trophy they don't have trophies on Wii U, DarkSakura well I don't have a Wii U so I don't care and
Was there more with that, Loki?
I'm sorry.
I think I cut you off and suddenly we went into... No, we were done talking.
We were in playground chat at that point.
We were done talking.
It's a rumor.
Rumor, rumor, rumor.
Rumor, rumor, rumor.
There's another joke there about the name of the game and for some strange reason I just can't put the words together.
Something, something, and we use...
What was the name of this?
Re-U-Magined?
Re-U-Magined, yes.
Re-U-Magined.
It honestly sounds like a special episode of RuPaul's Drag Race.
Like Ru-U-Magined or something.
Is that what the Lost episodes, what they're calling that on TV right now?
You know I've never watched an episode of that.
The Ru-vibed episode.
How are we friends?
I mean to.
I used to watch Drag U.
Oh, okay, well, similar.
Then you know enough.
Because I like seeing, as much as Rue makes a gorgeous woman, I loved the suits.
It was all about the suits.
That red suit.
Tim Tripp in our chat says, I just had a moment where I thought I was listening to Horde House, but we didn't have Grandpa say something racially insensitive, so it's not truly an episode of Horde House at this point.
Let's move on quickly before we go there.
Maybe I'm just channeling exta for an entirely feminine manner.
I haven't brought up bleaching the parts.
Next story is about Nintendo as well.
Talking about cross-play titles.
Right now, most cross-play we think of on PlayStation with PS3 or 4 and the PlayStation Vita.
In fact, Hotline Miami, I was talking about earlier in the show.
When you download that, you get a Vita version and a PlayStation 3 version.
All your saves transfer through the cloud.
It's all through the cloud.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Virtual Console on the Wii U because it has two screens and the same damn controls and you can fucking do any 3DS game on there.
They're just not doing it yet.
Alright, well Nintendo has come out and said, quote, I almost said Vita.
as well as other video game systems not made by Nintendo.
And the reasoning behind that, just so you know, this is because of pure chess, which you can actually play on the Wii U, but you can also cross-play with PlayStation 3 and Vita.
Now, the reason why this is news is because this is a huge reason why you do not see Final Fantasy XIV on the Xbox 360.
Square wanted to put it on the 360, but Microsoft said, no, we will not support the cross-play element.
You will not be able to... Xbox has to be its own server, its own world and everything.
Xbox will not cross-play, which is funny because Final Fantasy XI was totally not like that and had play-online...
but you have to go back a few years Microsoft was desperate to have a Final Fantasy game on the 360 so they broke their own rule in that case only and that's why you got 13 later on on the 360 which was controversial but I digress back to Nintendo
Smash Brothers.
Well, not cross systems.
I didn't think that the Wii U had an online portion for Disney Infinity.
Because I know they were... I think it maybe was limited to two players only.
But I thought that that was something that was taken out of... I can't speak firsthand because I haven't played Disney Infinity.
Maybe I'm thinking the Wii version.
I'm not aware of that.
I think you're thinking of either the regular Wii version, but I think the Wii U is comparable to the other systems.
So I don't think that's... Maybe somebody in chat knows.
Well, it's nice that different consoles play together.
I mean...
TV, TV, TV, TV
What can you do by moving your hand?
You can... Anyone?
Anyone?
Anyone?
You can Skype?
Flip off the characters?
That's it.
Skype.
But isn't Skype cross-platform by default?
I can Skype on my iPhone.
I can Skype on my computer.
And what's... So why is Skype okay?
Is it because it's a Microsoft product?
I don't know.
Why is Skype okay when all this other stuff isn't?
It is Microsoft.
Microsoft bought Skype.
Yeah, it is now.
Obviously, it didn't start as one for a long time.
It's touting Skype.
Oh, you can Skype your other Xbox One plane-owning individuals.
Well, that's just the same voice and video chat they've already had on their network.
If you go to Skype.com, you have that whole Metro look.
And to go on yet another tangent away from what the story was supposed to be about, but I can't help myself, Skype, very controversial patch coming soon to Skype.
And the 6.1 patch that's due out in December, they are going to block third-party apps.
and this is very controversial because many people record their podcasts over Skype using a program like CallGraph.
We actually did Horde House with that for a while or Pamela, I think one is called.
There's all these different programs people use in Skype to do their podcasts.
They're going to be screwed because Skype is disabling access to this.
Oh, I've kind of figured you would have meant things like there's a lot of instant messaging apps that can use Skype for text messaging but not voice and video calls.
Yeah, so it's a very controversial thing going into effect.
Thank you, Xbox One.
DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
My old laptop had all that too.
That's actually how I used to record BBC Radio 1.
Yeah.
I'd record interviews off of that.
Nice.
Very nice.
So, yeah, Nintendo Crossplay.
No, it's a good thing.
And I...
You know who does Nintendo best?
Nintendo.
So I'm looking forward to seeing what they do with this.
And I think Smash Brothers seems like the obvious candidate.
What's going to be that synergy between the 3DS and the Wii U version that we don't know about yet?
There's definitely going to be something there.
What is it?
Don't know yet.
We'll find out.
There's that part of me...
tinfoil hat mode going a very similar direction to what Loki's saying is that oh well you know soon you're gonna be able to play 3DS games on the Wii U I kind of think because you know we got the 2DS this year which you know it's a thing it's a new system did I tell you I played one of those this week I don't think I did one of my friends has a 2DS and I played the 2DS this week
Next year, we ought to be due for some type of new handheld out of Nintendo, right?
I mean, even though we don't need one per se, that isn't going to stop them from making one.
What if they make some type of 3DS that can double as, wait for it, a Wii U touchpad?
because there's all the outcry out there for how can I buy a second touchpad?
How can I do it?
What if the second touchpad is a 3DS?
We also need something in the portable consoles that supports the Nintendo Network.
Why not?
Because the 3DS still does front codes.
Yes, but at least it's a universal friend code.
Sure.
Yeah, I mean, the system's a hell of a lot better than the original DS.
It's just the fact that we haven't seen an firmware update yet.
Obviously, we still can in the next year, but especially for Smash Bros.
and what they want to continue to do down the road, their portable system needs to come in line and start supporting these same things that the Wii U does.
Codeman in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, Rob, is the screen too small?
It doesn't have to be.
And I'm not saying they're going to make this giant 3DS as big as one of those touchpads.
What has to be the same?
The resolution has to be the same, not the size.
So it's very possible that could happen.
I'm tinfoil hatting and making shit up, admittedly.
Why not?
It's rumor week on OLR because it's that week in gaming news.
So there you go.
It's rumor week.
That's right, rumors.
Some other podcasters in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com with some advice for people that are going to get screwed with the Skype changes.
Ranma says, use a USB mixer and audition for podcasting.
Blackwolf says, I use two sound cards.
So there's other ways to do it.
Alrighty, let's move on with some more news.
DarkSakura.
Well, in other news, there is a day one patch for the PS4 that's 300 megabytes and it's adding some interesting things.
It's going to add in the remote play, which means that the titles will be displayed on the TV and you can use the Vita to connect to them.
The second screen, basically, the Vita.
You can record, take screenshots, upload different videos that you've taken.
You can watch other people play games.
You need Twitch mode.
You can play as you download.
You have multiple logins up to four people.
Voice chat, you have facial recognition and voice commands.
This is if you have the camera.
Um, background music player, online multiplayer, and the Blu-ray and DVD player.
So, they're basically going, oops, all this stuff, here you go.
So, I mean, I see no reason to be upset about that, except that, you know, I mean, 300 meg isn't really that big.
It's just basically saying, oh, we have this functionality, now we're unlocking it.
There you go.
Have fun.
Party.
Literally.
Because we have party mode.
You can talk to your friends and call them assholes.
I wouldn't.
Thanks for watching!
Who cares if I can download a title and play partway?
I don't have internet, so it doesn't matter to me.
So that's the only thing that's kind of lame about that.
But yeah, a lot of people nowadays have internet, so they could probably download it one way or another.
As long as I think is...
as long as they support being able to download that off of a storage device or something like that so you can go to your friend's house, download it onto a USB stick and pop it into your PS4 or something like that like you can right now with the PlayStation 3 then that might not be so bad if someone doesn't actually have internet then they could just go somewhere else and get it but if it's like the Xbox 360 or something usually you can't do that, you have to burn a disc or something
There is a part of me – sorry, Jamie.
There is a part of me that wonders like, well, those poor people that are going to buy this system mostly for the Blu-ray playback are going to get screwed because they can't connect to the internet.
But then I go, well, wait a minute.
When those people just get a PlayStation 3 because they're still on the market and they're going to be cheaper, like these early adopters have got to be techie people in the first place, right?
Yeah.
I don't think this news is super bad or – it's –
It's an inconvenience.
And to be fair, at least the update's a lot smaller than the Wii U one.
300 megs, I mean, fuck, that's half the size of the DLC for Saints Row 4, and you're getting way more replay value out of that.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Jason, I'm sure they already do that.
Like, if you were to ask them those types of questions at Best Buy, like, you know, how could I switch between my Xbox and my PlayStation or whatever, I'm sure Geek Squad would be happy to come out there and hook it all up for you.
I always have to wave off that stupid $3 disc insurance thing whenever I buy a game.
Or Grandma, you know, I want to set up Netflix on the Wii for my kid and they literally don't know how to do it because, you know, I could see where there's a small market for that.
Yeah, Ranma says they do that now.
Yeah.
I had a feeling but there's a few other things with this one thing that will not be available at launch is the suspend resume mode that's supposed to basically use the low power state and take you back into your game but they said there's more to come on that in the future there's also a PlayStation app that's going to be out on November 13th in North America and the 22nd of November in Europe
DarkSakura
that's it I mean it's just like hey I bought this car I heard all these great things about the wheels it has oh fuck it doesn't have wheels damn no we can't have that and we will continue to not have that for the foreseeable decades
Without devolving on yet another tangent, this is one of those things that there's very much an argument to the success of Valve in the sense that they don't tout everything until it's there.
Valve has not said a word about Half-Life 3.
We know nothing of what Half-Life 3 will be.
If and when it finally gets here, there's no expectations other than it's got to be better than the second game, and there's a good chance that that's going to happen.
Is Valve a publicly traded company?
and DarkSakura.com
it's a really really tangled web because at the same time more often than not company stocks sink during news announcements or at least maybe the most popular ones like Amazon, Apple and possibly also Microsoft but that's not an uncommon trend which seems to say why do we even bother going through this media hype only to have bad news once we get to the end of it
Alright, well, is that it, DarkSakura?
Do you have more?
No, I actually had more to say about the app, but I didn't get it out.
It's Tangent-y tonight.
Yeah, I know.
The app itself, what it's supposed to do is it lets you access the PlayStation Network, your friends list, your trophies, but it also is to act as a second screen for games that support it.
So, I wanted to get that out.
Awesome.
For people who don't know.
I just hope the servers don't all get hammered the first day and the damn thing takes forever to download like what happened on Wii U. Are you being prophetic?
Well, just saying.
They will.
I'm sure they will.
You just jinxed them, Rob.
Thank you.
Thanks, Rob.
No.
This is like one of the first rules of the internet.
This stuff always happens.
Here we go.
Here's how they can do this.
Okay.
Put up the patch now on their website.
Download it to the fucking thumb drive.
Thank you.
Why don't they just do that?
Thank you.
That would be a great idea, actually.
Hey, we know our servers are probably going to get hammered at launch.
Hey, you want to be a little bit imprimptive about it?
Put it on fucking BitTorrent.
Put a BitTorrent out there.
Then it won't even be on their servers.
I don't know about that.
Yeah, I'm just saying.
You could.
That's a little too controversial for them.
But then hackers would tear that shit apart.
They're going to tear it apart anyway.
What are they going to do with it?
It's just going to take them five minutes longer.
Figure out that much faster how to install Linux on it, I guess.
They've already done it to the toaster, so don't get me started.
Okay, so a little bit more about the PlayStation 4.
There were some details coming out about the digital games and some of the benefits you get with PlayStation Plus.
For example, digital games, you can actually share your account with two consoles.
So you have one console that you deem your primary console that kind of operates the way I see it.
It's similar to like...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
You can also use two systems concurrently.
So the system activated is your primary PS4 and one other system that you're logged into.
So that, to me, sounds like if I get Grand Theft Auto V for the PlayStation 4 or something like that, or whatever, and I have the digital download for, like... I download it to my system, and then I...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
If everybody's in the same household, you can have those guest accounts, which are the same gamertag with the 1, 2, 3 appended to it.
I think that's what you're thinking of, but certainly not across two consoles in different locations.
No, it sounds like... Well, I mean, it sounds similar to what... I think, didn't you guys have to do something like that with Mass Effect or something, where you'd play on one console and log in with the other person's thing?
I don't know.
They've kind of done this right now, I want to say, with...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
So, they started limiting that down to, I think now it's down to two.
And I think that's what they have here.
So, you could exploit that, but I don't think it's meant for that.
It's more of like, you know, I'm going to my friend's house or something.
Yeah, it's more like you are going to go to your friends and play one game, but your little brother is still at home playing your PlayStation 4.
Like, it's more like that kind of situation, right?
I think so.
Two is pretty reasonable.
Yeah, I think that's how it's supposed to be.
Oh, here we go.
It says, let's see.
That graphic is clear as mud.
Yeah, that is... I don't understand what the fuck they're talking about.
A system that is activated as a primary.
Yeah, you had it right.
Don't get it.
I think that's... Yeah, I think I had it right.
You had it right.
You can... You, with your account, with your PlayStation Network account, can download things to the console.
As soon as it's on the console, anybody else can take advantage of that locally.
Nobody else can start a download using your account.
It's pretty expected.
Some other random details that were released, I guess, that the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One both support up to eight people in party chat.
Now, here's my question.
How many does the Xbox 360 support now in party chat?
Because I think it's quite a few people.
I think eight.
You think six?
I thought it was only six.
I seem to remember it's a full game limited to four plus just two more.
Could be wrong.
It's been forever since I've used that.
I don't know because I know I've had a lot of people in party chat before but I don't remember I haven't really counted there's no it worked so it'd be interesting hopefully it's the same or more you know yeah and he said party voice chat will support eight players like on PlayStation 4 like from support.xbox.com a party can contain up to eight people once the maximum attendance is reached someone must leave the party before another person can join
That's the GTFO our party right now.
We want someone cool.
Get out.
We have no cake for you.
I was gonna say, like, eight seems right because, like, isn't, like, a Forza Horizon match, like, eight people and, like, a lot of Xbox Live stuff is, like, eight people, I think.
So, anyway.
Alright.
That's it.
Bravely Default for the Sequel Bravely Default for the Sequel
Bravely Second will have time-stopping antics, which were in the original game.
But it relies on what's called SP, special power.
Once you use this power, your SP decreases.
You can gain SP when you put your 3DS in sleep mode, but it's a little bit slow.
It's like regening mana in EverQuest.
It's very, very slow.
One SP point is added for every eight hours of idle time.
But guess what?
If you don't want to wait...
You can buy potions on the 3DS eShop that refill your SP.
I've seen that model before on a Facebook game.
Yuck.
Well, we keep telling Nintendo they need to learn the internet, so where better to turn to?
This is not the place to do it.
I don't think this is actually a Nintendo game, however.
Um...
We don't know.
Producer Tomoya Asano assures fans that this will be a good thing.
Of course.
Quote, Bravely Second isn't a demerit, but a system that gives players an advantage.
It's convenient and it's very powerful.
So in other words, it's for people that want to cheat, I guess is what I'm reading in that.
And so if you want to like, you can buy cheats, essentially.
This game is out in Japan in December.
I don't know if it's coming out here.
I haven't heard anything about it.
I'm trying to see.
Bravely Default Western release includes updated for the sequel.
We had the first one.
So, Bravely Default, I'm switching my internal clock to make it look like it's a day later.
Oh, look, there's all my energy back.
Yeah, I wonder if people would be able to time travel and trick the thing that way.
Another article on the site says that it's going to be out in North America in 2014.
Oh, thank you.
I didn't play the first one, I gotta be honest.
But I did hear about it, and some people seem to enjoy it.
I really hope that this is something that truly, not just because the dude says it is, truly has no impact on the game if I were to not use it.
In other words, I could still beat the game start to finish without too much hassle, without even touching this stuff.
Because that would just be shitty.
I don't really have another word for it.
One point for every eight hours, though.
On any scale of any RPG I've ever played, that's ludicrously small.
Let's assume something's 15 points.
That's what, four days of idle before you recharge that?
It's ridiculous.
Shane's telling me we haven't had the first one, but I'm looking at it right here on Amazon for sale.
Or is this an import?
That's just Japanese.
I got fooled.
It has a really pretty art.
So you know somebody that imported it?
I guess so.
As if there's not plenty of people around this table that's ever done something like that for a game before.
All right, let's move on before we get to release dates, DarkSakura.
We have, remember last week we talked about, was it last week I think, that Nintendo wasn't going to be making Wii for Japan anymore?
This is Wii, not the Wii U. Well, it's already been confirmed as well for Europe.
They are going to be producing no more for the European markets, and Nintendo of the UK said that the consumers who don't own a Wii can still buy a Wii Mini instead.
that's the lower price point that has a bunch of the stuff missing it's all using DLC sorry it's only disc based games and no deals no download titles and no backwards compatibility but no word for the US yet there was a second body type for the Wii
I don't know if the Mini ever did.
Canada.
Canada got the red one, of course.
But I don't think it ever came out in the U.S.,
I missed all of this news.
It's just crap.
Seriously, if you're gonna save money on a Wii, buy a used Wii.
Why bother wasting money on a brand new piece of shit that doesn't do anything?
The Wii does have a huge game library though for people that might want to get one for a younger person.
Entry level gaming console or whatever.
And really the Wii was only good for me for one thing and that was weather and Wii News and I can't do that anymore because the news channel doesn't work.
I checked that every... It's funny that you mentioned that because I kind of liked those channels for a very long time.
There's always something wrong with the news channel and yeah, I don't know.
I found easier... Oh, no, I know what happened.
I found an iPhone and then having to go back to a console on my TV was not exactly as important or convenient anymore.
I just can't believe that I waited in line for that except that I hung out with Kristen the whole time and it was pretty fun and we got donuts.
It was alright in the beginning.
Excite Truck was awesome.
You're still mad about Excitebots.
I am still fucking... I am furious about Excitebots.
Seriously.
Who on the face of the earth thought, hey, let's put a minigame in the middle of a fucking race, and that's a great idea?
I don't know.
I want to punch them in the goddamn face.
Like, for some reason, it's become like a trend on Twitter lately to really hate on the Twilight Princess as part of the Zelda series.
But, I mean, that game was like the shit when it first came out on the Nintendo Wii.
I mean, just kind of what it did.
And I named my cat after her.
and kind of like, you know, what that brought to the table for gaming in general.
So I guess, you know, now if you go back and play it now, it's a little bit like, oh, this is very linear.
But I mean, it was great at the time.
Yeah, the Wii brought a lot of great games.
Come on.
All right, let's move on.
We've got to travel around the world and check out some release dates and what's coming out near you soon.
Yes.
So this week, actually a lot of games, but no particular order here.
Monster High 13 Wishes for Girls on the Wii and Wii U, 3DS and DS.
They're also doing some collections of games, XCOM and Civ V, the 2K definitive strategy collection on PC.
Sonic Lost World on 3DS and Wii U, Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures, the game that sort of resembles some of the 3D Sonic games and based on some new animated TV series, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii and Wii U and 3DS I believe.
The Game Stick is finally coming out.
and no one cared.
The 2K Power Pack Collection with Darkness 2.
Actually, that might be the first Darkness.
The Darkness Mafia 2 and Bioshock.
I have to make sure here.
I can't read this.
Bioshock 2, Darkness 2 and Mafia 2.
Those are coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
Battlefield 4 on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC this week Angry Birds Star Wars on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, Wii U, 3DS, and Vita Beyblade Evolution on 3DS
Assassin's Creed 4 Black Flag on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii U, and no PC.
That's coming out later because we can't get their release dates coordinated for the PC versions.
WWE 2K14 on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
What else here?
Transformers Ultimate Battle Edition re-released there.
Also, Ultimate Autobots Edition.
And... There's one last one here.
I have more Angry Birds.
Doodle Jump for 3DS.
Yay!
Yeah, 3DS and DS.
Doodle Jump.
And then...
Also, I think on Friday, I think that's the first, they're going to have a Wii Remote Plus for Luigi and Mario.
Alrighty, because that's cool and all.
I wanted to add, this is kind of funny, because I don't know if they even talked next-gen release dates yet, but Call of Duty Ghosts on all formats will be coming out on the 5th.
That's right.
You can get Call of Duty Ghosts
2 weeks before the system that comes out to play it on the Xbox One.
Alright, let's take a look at Japan and what's coming out in Japan.
They're getting their releases on Halloween the 31st.
The FPS Pad 3 Strike Gear.
I think that's actually an accessory.
Sorry, that's not a game.
But you can get a Mahjong game called Dankyu Battle 3.
It comes out this week on the PlayStation 3.
Tears to Tiara 2, How No Matsue comes out in a first print limited edition, if you're so inclined.
And then Vampire Resurrection, just in time for Halloween, gets a price reduction.
So there you go on the PlayStation 3.
On the Xbox 360, there is really nothing this week.
You can get that same little FPS pad thing I talked about before.
That's really it.
on the PlayStation Vita this week Gundam Breaker and there is also a new slim model because I believe those Vita slims those just came out in Japan like last couple weeks ago or one of them right there's a Gundam Breaker Vita pack if you're so inclined so that's out also Chu Jijijen Gemu Neptune Rebirth 1 in regular and limited edition is out on the Vita as well
on the Wii U this week.
Yes, there is some Wii U stuff in Japan this week.
Wii Party U is one of the big games coming out.
And then there's some stuff that's centered around, it looks like Wii Fit U, but is that available for download on the 31st?
I don't remember how that whole thing was going down.
Remember you could download it a month early or something?
Yeah, you're supposed to be able to download it a month early, and I know that next, not next week, but the week after next, those stupid Wii Fit
and DarkSakura.com.
Oh yeah, looks like there's a new bundle in Japan that's 32 gigs, Black Wii U, with Mario Bros.
U, Wii Party U, Wii Fit U, a Wiimote, and the whole little sensor bar thing.
And it comes with one of the little portable walk...
What are those called?
They look like Tamagotchis, for God's sake.
They're little Wii U Tamagotchis.
But it's you.
That's straight up the pocket station right there.
Right?
They've got a hefty little bundle there in Japan out this week.
All right.
Let's see.
Also, moving on to the Nintendo 3DS, Danball Senki Wars is out this week.
And Chara Petsukute Sodatete, character Shogaku, comes out this week.
And that's just cute little animals, including a pink panda who has hearts for ears.
Oh, that's adorable.
That's it for Japanese releases.
How about the UK, DarkSakura?
In the UK, we have on the 29th of October, WWE K-14, on the 31st, Football Manager 2014 for PC and Mac, and Toki Tori.
Excuse me.
On November 1st, there's Angry Birds Star Wars for damn near everything, and Angry Birds Star Wars 2 for damn near every console.
Assassin's Creed 4, Black Flag, Battlefield 4, Blur Overdrive for iPad and iPhone, and Wii Fit U.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Instead of Nintendo Land being in there, they're kind of updating the whole SKU with now new Super Mario Bros.
U and the DLC new Super Luigi U. So you'll be able to get that for $2.99 this holiday starting, I believe, the end of next week.
Be pretty fast.
And then also, even though it is leaving shelves in a couple other regions, the Wii will still be around in the US.
And basically the announcement of the Wii console being discontinued is specific to Japan, well now Europe.
There's no change of status in the Wii in the United States and is available for purchase this holiday season.
Metal Gear Rising will be getting a PlayStation 3 special edition.
it's a DLC bundled PlayStation 3 re-release that's going to come out later this year for Metal Gear Rising and it's the Revengeance Special Edition it will have Blade Wolf and Jetstream DLC packs 30 VR missions 5 alternate costumes and a custom PlayStation 3 theme you can check all that out on December 5th and it's also going to be available as a download on PlayStation Network as most of the game releases are don't know yet if this is coming out stateside
This is only confirmed for Japan as of right now.
Speaking of PlayStation, I have another quick story.
This is about a whole little PlayStation bundle.
This is interesting.
A Gran Turismo 6 bundle that's going to come out in Brazil.
It's an... I'm going to mispronounce this name, and I apologize because he passed away in 1994, but he was a very famous racer.
Ayrton Senna.
I hope I didn't mispronounce that.
I apologize if I did.
But he's going to be featured as part of this Gran Turismo 6 bundle that's coming out.
And it's supposed to actually kind of like help charity, which is pretty cool.
I'm assuming that part of the proceeds of the bundle actually go to the institute set up in this guy's name that helps to educate.
So that's pretty cool.
This is on December 6th that this is coming out in Brazil.
It comes out with Gran Turismo 6, a 250 gigabyte PlayStation 3, and one controller.
So...
That's very cool.
One other reason I bring this up is that I don't know if you guys saw, but apparently the PlayStation 4 is going to cost oodles and oodles of money in Brazil.
Did you hear about that?
It kind of doesn't surprise me, though.
Yeah, everything costs more over there.
Yeah, I know, but it's like on the scale of $1,500 or something.
When you convert the money, it's a really high price.
I bet there will be people that just somehow get one from the U.S.
or another place and import them for way less.
But it's taxes.
The thing is, taxes really affect the price.
It's not that they're marking it up.
People get them illegally.
All right.
Let's travel back to a time when Gran Turismo 5 wasn't even out.
Heck, I don't even think the original Gran Turismo was out.
In fact, some people would still agree that Gran Turismo 5 is not out yet.
That's the joke I was trying to make unsuccessfully.
But it's time for DarkSakura to step into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, hey, you should, like, play this now and stuff.
You're going to roll your eyes.
I'm totally going to roll my eyes at this week's...
Don't do anything for Shane.
That was the first mistake.
I am doing something for Shane so that he will help me level.
You're only making him stronger.
That's right.
You're only making his horrible powers stronger.
Shane, don't listen to them.
You have good taste in music.
All right, DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week?
It's Pokemon Red and Blue.
Don't laugh.
These aren't classics.
Don't judge me.
You're totally judging me right now.
Maybe a little bit.
Anyway.
So anyway, this was developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo for the Game Boy.
And this came out in 1996.
Actually, in Japan, they came out as Red and Green.
And Blue was released as a special edition.
Then they were released as Red and Blue in North America, Europe, and Australia over the next three years.
Pokemon Yellow is a special version that was basically like, hi, here's Pikachu.
Both have been remade, by the way, as Pokemon FireRed and LeafGreen that came out in 2004.
So basically, overhead perspective, you go through the fictional area of Kanto, and you basically abuse your poor little animals and make Peeta cry.
I'm kidding, because that was a fake.
But you basically pit your animals against each other and see who is the greatest.
Of course, you know...
I love how in Japan the game was more marketed as with the adventure and everything.
And yeah, the collection thing was a part of it, but it's like blatant commercialism out here.
Gotta catch them all!
Like rabies or something, I don't know.
So anyway, you have to fight the different gym leaders and you collect badges and you beat the game like that.
So, uh...
Other things about this game is that you have a little thing in there called the Pokédex.
And basically for the first game you had 150 available Pokémon and you could keep track of all of them that you catch in your Pokédex and you still had to deal with Team Rocket.
You could also use your GameLink cable to connect your games together and let you trade and battle between games, which my husband and I did quite a bit.
I believe Dan played Red and I played Blue.
Then there was the 151st Pokemon Mew that you could only get through official distribution by Nintendo.
or buy a glitch and I won't say anything about getting it that way because I got it.
Honestly though I used... The Nintendo police are coming to your house right now.
Whatever, they're a little late.
So yeah, I mean basically IGN ranked it as one of the top 100 games of all time and in 2009 it was in the Guinness Book of World Records as best-selling RPG on Game Boy and best-selling RPG on time.
So basically you have the third person overhead view but when you're in your battles it switches to a behind the back of your whatever Pokemon that you're playing and you can change them out.
You have up to six.
You cannot teach...
You know, Pokemon who have wings, you have to teach them how to fly.
I mean, really, what's up with that?
You get experience, you level them up.
You also can get some of the most useless piece of crap Pokemon ever, like Magikarp.
But, Magikarp turns into Gyarados, and I have gone through the entire game with Gyarados, and I haven't even anything else.
The first time I did that whole wonder trade on Pokemon X and Y, somebody sent me a fucking Magikarp.
But of course it was Japanese Magikarps, that made it a little cooler.
Oh, Rob.
Anyway, as far as other elements in the game, you do also have the capturing aspect where you can find Pokemon in the wild and you can put them into a life of eternal servitude living in little balls for the rest of their existence.
Like little animal genies that come out and do cage fighting for you.
Yeah.
And to also say something about something that was mentioned in the last game, Pikachu is the breed, not its name.
It's like calling your dog, Dog.
It's like calling your cat, Cat.
I had a cat named Mr. Cat.
That was a little bit more respectful.
It'd be like saying Pikachu-san.
So anyway, there have been other versions, of course.
There were gold, silver, and crystal.
That was a second generation.
And using the transfer pack on Nintendo 64, you could actually use items from your red and blue in Pokemon Stadium and Pokemon Stadium 2.
However, they were not compatible with the advanced generation.
Which, I actually had Pokemon Stadium, but I kind of didn't play it much.
Um, really the best part about Pokemon Stadium was like, just watching your Pokemon come out and do their little poses and then it got boring.
Um, I love seeing Shrew.
Anyway, I'm looking over the shoulder.
So the setting of the game takes place in Kanto.
And it's got different habitats for the different Pokemon, different towns and cities, and routes that connect them all to each other.
And you can get some of them only by fishing.
You can get stuff like a Zubat only in the cave.
So you're sent out by Professor Oak.
Um, who, uh, lets you pick one, and then, um, you are in a rivalry with Oak's grandson.
And, uh, who, what was his name, Gary?
Um, cause I remember, cause the character in Japan was actually named after Miyamoto, his name was Shigeru.
So, um...
There's also a rumor that we were supposed to get a version of, that there had been an intention to do a version of Green that had a female trainer.
But that, you know, that's still on the rumor mill.
Anyway, you can start off with Bulbasaur, Squirtle, or Charmander.
And yeah, my first game playthrough is Bulbasaur.
Every other time I've ever, you know, I switched to Red and was like Charmander all the way because I didn't care.
Um, but uh, my first playthrough was with Bulbasaur.
And uh, basically you uh, eventually have to fight the Elite Four, and the new champion who is, boom, your rival, so you have to kick their ass.
So the whole concept of Pokemon started, and I don't know how many people um, know about this, that um, the designer Satoshi Tajiri was an insect collector.
and uh so basically he wanted to give that same feeling of discovery of capture of you know collection like that of live specimens into a game that wouldn't people could play anytime you wouldn't necessarily have to live out in the country for it
Um, you know, he was noticing that kids played more in their homes instead of outside, so he wanted to sort of give people the feeling of being able to grow up in the outside environment, and like I said, that sense of discovery.
Um, he also did not want to make games that had more, as he said, pointless violence, even though he's having animals fight each other.
Okay.
So, um, I mean, basically, uh, that was the other one I was trying to remember, is that the character that you play as is named Satoshi, after, you know, himself.
And of course his rival is Shikaru, after Miyamoto.
So, um, it's really, you know, there's so much more about this, you know, a lot of history that went into the, um, production of the game, like, um,
They even made some different audio advancements by using different sounds in the processor to create a snare sound using basically a white noise filter in the Game Boy.
Creating the animal sounds by using the Pokemon sounds by basically making it a very short chiptune.
It was supposed to be originally called Capsule Monster, but there was a trademark issue.
They were going to call it Capomon, and basically they went to Pocket Monster, so it's Pokemon.
And it was basically rejected over and over by Nintendo until Miyamoto came out with the golden way of making it work.
So, that's why we have it.
Um...
So that's... I'm not going to go into a lot more of the detail because really there is a whole hell of a lot about this game.
But, um...
If you haven't played the original, I think you're kind of missing out.
Even if you're not a big fan of Pokemon at all today, if you don't care about the new ones, I think that if anyone wants a good, rounded-off, classic gaming background, Pokemon should be in it.
So, that's my final word.
Alright, there it is, your Classic Game of the Week, or Games of the Week, Pokemon Red and Pokemon Blue.
And you can add yellow into it because it was the same gen.
I was going to say, my first Pokemon game was yellow.
So it was the same gen.
I got the see-through, off-purple Game Boy Color and Pokemon Yellow.
Yeah, it was because of the damn anime that I loved Pokemon.
You know, I had the Japanese theme song memorized for years.
And I actually have... You know how you used to buy singles in those square cases with the little tiny disc inside?
I actually have the Niasu Sings.
Nice.
Niasu is Meowth.
So it also has the full Team Rocket song on it.
I squeed in the new Pokemon X and Y when wild Pikachus were showing up in the second zone you're in.
I was like, yes, that's the Pokemon I want to capture.
The right call.
And also, just to say, one of Shermie's nicknames was Caterpie.
Just saying.
Just saying.
It is pretty crazy to think that the games Red and Blue predated the anime.
Yeah, I know, right?
I think that the games, I think that it was more of a simultaneous thing over here.
Because the anime had already been out forever.
And for the record, the Porygon episode totally did not make me have a seizure.
All right.
We're going to take a quick break, guys.
When we come back, there's plenty more OLR to come, including rapid-fire news, more emails.
I know we already had one at the top of the show.
We've got more to come.
Fugle Question of the Week and plenty, plenty more.
Your calls as well, 1-877-GAME-OLR.
We'll be back, though, after a quick break with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
Don't go anywhere.
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio, live on this Sunday night with episode number 525 of our show.
That's a palindrome, and it's a multiple of 25, so therefore it's an event episode tonight.
Well, it's always an event when the awesome Jason is here with us, as he can't join us all the time, but once in a while he's in San Francisco for work and drives up the road to come say hi.
Because 22 hours to San Francisco in the first place wasn't enough.
Had to do the extra two hours up to Sacramento.
Do you wave the first time through?
I was thinking of making a surprise stop in here because I was... I don't remember if I was in Sacramento city limits or at least around the downtown area when the show started or if it was just after.
And I probably should have considering that I proceeded to take about four hours because of the traffic.
in just South Sacramento, plus the traffic in Berkeley, plus the traffic in downtown.
You drove in during the BART strike.
Congrats.
That was not a very nice end to two days worth of driving.
I bet.
Oh my gosh.
So you drove here all the way from Colorado where you live.
Do you drive nonstop and pull over and sleep?
Where do you stop?
I could do it because it's about 20-21 hours.
In this case, I left just before noon on Saturday.
Drove out to Nevada.
Stayed in Elko, Nevada.
Very small town.
About central Nevada.
And then continued the rest of the way.
The next day, I pulled into the parking lot.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and you guys can share your opinions as well you can either do that live with us tonight live.vognetwork.com if you're listening to us on this Sunday night or of course if you're listening to us on the podcast you can always tweet at us at OLR or you can email us mailbag at orangelaunceradio.com let's check out some rapid fire news and quickly talk about a few things here Loki
Yes, so since there really hasn't been too much going on with Minecraft on the Xbox 360 as far as updates go, they have been putting out some skin packs to re-skin the whole look of Minecraft and sometimes include free levels and stuff.
They have another one coming out though for Halloween.
It kind of re-skins everything, makes another nice and green and everything very Halloween-y.
And the price of that...
Free!
So, I think you can afford that.
So go check it out if you haven't yet.
And also, creepers are nice and ghostly white now.
So that's kind of fun.
And the Slenderman's about.
Ah, yes, I'm assuming that they've redone the Enderman then to make him look like a Slenderman.
Very clever, I guess.
Alright, and then on top of that, Grand Theft Auto, since I love talking about Grand Theft Auto,
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
It's going to be next week, I think, or maybe even beyond that.
The Beach Bum Pack is something that they're going to put out.
It's the first piece of DLC that's going to be free.
And it's going to add some weapons and vehicles to the game, as well as clothing items.
And that's both online and single player.
And then also, of course, the content creator for Deathmatch and Races is going to be available as well in November.
And so you'll be able to create your own Deathmatches and Deathmatch arenas.
and races in the game which I think is going to be pretty awesome when we get to do that and last but not least it's been leaked out that there is a new kind of zombie mode in the game of Call of Duty Ghosts except now instead of zombies it's extinction and extinction has to do with aliens so you're fighting off aliens instead of zombies and
and they're going to have the different type of stuff to go along with that as well.
So, interesting.
I guess we'll learn more about that pretty soon since the game comes out in two weeks.
or you can always get your PlayStation 4 one early and just look at the box and think about that alien mode, right?
Yeah, or the Xbox One.
You have extra time to contemplate the alien mode.
That's right.
Just sit there and think about it.
Killer Instinct, some more news coming out about that.
In fact, I've seen some footage coming out of those Xbox One preview events of Killer Instinct.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
apparently the highest difficulty level in the game when you're in training mode you can do very easy of course and hard and so forth but the most difficult level is something called Kyle it's apparently named on one of the development team's AI designers who is insanely good at the game so you can fight Kyle who I guess works there and is really really good at I hate you Kyle I hate you Kyle
SuperCastlevania4
is the Wii U release on Virtual Console this week on Halloween.
Now, I already had that when it was on the Wii.
Speaking of games, I have in the box.
That's right.
So I can get this for a dollar if I want to get the Wii U Virtual Console version, which I probably will.
You can come to my house and play it.
I can, but... Dude, that would be awesome.
Castlevania Fest on Halloween.
But I can't... See, what I can do in my house that I can't do at your house is play Castlevania 4 on the toilet.
I almost said in the toilet.
On the toilet.
technically, I have a way to do this
I have extension cords and very small TVs.
I guess I really shouldn't challenge you, should I?
All right.
I'll think of a way.
Remember, 90% of what I have done, motivated by spite.
Yes, and porn.
Anyhow, that was one of, obviously, the best Super Nintendo games and best games in the Castlevania series.
Not my absolute favorite in the Castlevania series, but for some people it is their favorite.
And I will say this, killer soundtrack.
Some of the best.
Oh, yeah.
But, you know, in my esteem, nothing beats Dracula X. Symphony of the Night.
I know it's cliche, but damn it.
So freaking good.
I would say of the traditional Castlevania games, Dracula X. Dracula X is more like a bridge between those styles.
I still have a soft spot for Simon's Quest, which I think is the earliest kind of Metroidvania style game.
What a terrible night for a curse.
Anyway.
But we're digressing again.
How about some rumors about other Mario Universe characters that could possibly be playable in Super Mario 3D World?
There's some speculation out there because of stamp collecting that occurs in Super Mario 3D World.
There's some icons that have been spotted where, hmm, this kind of looks like Rosalina.
Super Mario 3D World
is going to already have Luigi, Mario, Princess, and Toad in the style of their appearance in Super Mario 2, where Princess floats, Luigi does flappy legs, and all that stuff.
You mean Doki Doki Panic, the ROM hack?
Well, same thing.
It was a little more than a ROM hack, though.
I know, I stole that from Game Sack, but it was probably the best name for it I've ever heard.
DarkSakura, what do you have for us?
I have stuff I have a site that won't load so I'm skipping it
and this is the very important news that everyone's been waiting for.
How to avoid Pokemon X and Y's game breaking bug.
First of all, you can download the patch, which is out.
The patch is out there on the 3DS eShop and you just go there, update, blah, blah, blah, you're done.
However, other ways around...
Did we finally breed?
I'm literally opening up the eShop right now.
I was like, oh shit, she's got a point.
I thought you were checking to see if our machines... No, our DSs do not want to mate today for some reason.
Here, I'll move you over there.
Very rude.
I even had mine hump yours, okay?
No.
Oh my!
Scandal.
Anyway, so the other way that you could do that is that, like I said, Nintendo had put out a map that showed where the bug could occur, and so it gave you areas that you could save your game in and avoid the bug.
But now with the fix that's come out, it also should correct any broken game saves.
So wherever you saved, if you happen to have experienced this bug, if you haven't deleted your save file, then you should be fine.
It will be restored.
Just go to your eShop and download it.
in other news oh god I was just talking about Rival Schools a moment ago too there is some talk from Hideaki Itsuno who wants to create a Rival Schools 3 and Rival Schools is probably like my all time favorite number one fighting game series ever in the world universe I love it I mean I even like it better than all the Tekkens combined and I really like me some Tekken
So, um, he was the past director of the Rival School series, and he did, um, recently did Dragon's Dogma.
And, um, he basically, you know, what was, uh, said about it is that it was, it captured authentic fighting.
Um, as you say, basically, uh, Street Fighter II was his, um, inspiration.
So during an interview, he said, and this is with the Anime News Network, um...
He said that he would really like to make a new Rival Schools title.
Which, honestly, do it.
No hesitation, do it.
Bring back all the characters, put in some more.
We haven't had all the sports done.
We could have more hooligans.
We could have more.
I was talking about this before the show with Rob, and I was saying that I really, really miss Rival Schools Disc 2.
All of those minigames were incredibly fun.
Or, you know, you've had Sakura in the game now for two versions of it.
I mean, she's a hidden character in the first one.
And officially in... Well, you know, I have the Evolution disc.
That had, like, the dancing game and the dating sim and all that in it.
I paid a hundred bucks for that sucker when I had money.
And it's freaking awesome.
I'll have to show you some stuff on it.
But, like, I got, like, Batsu asked my character out.
It was all cool and cute.
But there were...
That's the game that introduced the Taicho, the class president, and the photographer, and dude who swims.
Why can't I remember his name?
But that's the game that introduced a lot of those characters that were in Rival Schools 2, and then Rival Schools 2 brought out my favorite of all time, Zaki.
But I mean, just think about it.
It's about time.
Why not?
Yeah.
And I'm actually, now I'm done filling time for the story that wouldn't load.
I can finish one off on that note my conventional popular still going fighting games I love but either Rival Schools or Bloody Roar are probably my two favorites from that era
Bloody Roar was an interesting game.
Didn't they actually remake that in like the last couple years?
No.
I don't recall.
I'm just crazy.
You may be thinking of Beast Riser.
I don't know why they call it Beast Riser.
That's just such a dumb name for it.
I think that was the Japanese name for it.
Because it had an arcade version of it.
That's a rip off of Bloody Roar.
At least it wasn't Brutal Paws of Fury.
Because that was kind of crap.
Alright, before we get to the Fugo question of the week We skipped a story Yeah, I was like, did you need me to do that?
Because it wouldn't load on her iPad, right?
Yeah, it wouldn't load at all Which, basically anything that I ever get from that site won't load Tsk, tsk, well, here we go This is important because it was in the intro, so we have to cover it
Sorry, sorry.
No, it's fine.
It has been found.
The ToeJam & Earl 3, Mission to Earth.
That's right.
Sega apparently made that for the Xbox, of course, but did you know that there was another ToeJam & Earl 3 at one point that was being made for the Dreamcast?
Some footage is now online, and apparently the owner of the disc wants to have a fundraiser to get the code online.
ToeJam & Earl 3 Back from the Dead ToeJam & Earl 3
Star Gladiator was awesome.
All right, now we can do the Fugle Question of the Week, yes?
I guess.
I guess.
All right, DarkSakura is going to permiss it at some point here.
So here we go.
You take Facebook, you take Google+, slam those words to give permission.
Permit.
Whatever.
Facebook and Google Plus slam them together and you get Fugle Plus.
Or we just call it Fugle.
Let's read some of the answers here.
And we had a lot of answers, you guys, over on Facebook and Google Plus.
I can't read them all.
There is not enough time.
I'm going to read some of these, though.
And the question we asked this week, what is the scariest moment you've ever experienced in a video game?
I mean, Halloween's next week, right?
So why not ask a question about scary games?
In spirit.
How about when I thought Aerith was going to come back to life?
That's a good answer.
There you go.
All right.
Or mine would be probably when I was playing Silent Hill 4 The Room and I literally screamed out loud and one of those baby face monsters came running at me and Loki was like, what the hell are you doing?
You know the only thing that creeped me out in that game was the giant head.
Oh, yeah.
Just watch you.
Sure.
DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Let's see, going to some other answers.
Dead Rising says, after gathering like 30,000 PP and then trying to run to a save point while killing zombies on my last health bar.
Scary.
I think that was Mike saying the game Dead Rising because the 30,000 percentage points.
See, when somebody writes their name like that, I'm like, is that what you want us to call you?
He's definitely talking about Dead Rising the game.
I can say that with 100% certainty.
There you go.
It does involve zombies.
Let's see, some more answers here.
Scott W. says, it always comes back to the dog crashing through the window in Resident Evil.
Shit gets me every time.
Oh my god, I remember that.
It was so scary.
Strudels89 says, playing The Last of Us in the Dark with my husband.
Walking around a corner thinking we're safe, then having two clickers jump out and rip Joel's throat out.
I screamed so loud and threw my controller on the bed.
CatFury05 says the first time I saw Pyramid Head in Silent Hill 2.
Still scares me to this day.
That was pretty creepy.
Mary B says Fatal Frame.
We were in our apartment in the dark having played for a couple hours.
As Pat said, they never attack on the stairs.
He was promptly attacked from above by one of those ghastly creatures and I let out a blood-curdling scream.
Game controller was thrown, lights turned on, and we were done for the night.
That and all of Fatal Frame's freaking
Celerity Ghosts Is that Mary Moo?
Yes it is That is your friend Mary Let's see, Curdy K responds and says, still being a kid and playing Friday the 13th on the NES That game was so bad That game was underrated It was good It was good for what it was There were better games, yes The Friday the 13th game was worse
I mean that Nightmare on Elm Street game.
The blah blah.
Let's see.
Eric D. says Resident Evil 2 when you get to the jail cells in the basement and the dogs break out and start chasing you down some dark hallways.
Man, that scared the crap out of me.
So there's another one for dogs in Resident Evil.
Let's see.
Justin M. says the opening of Half-Life 2 was pretty unnerving as was the in-browser boogeyman movie tie-in game.
Scared the bejesus out of me freshman year of college.
I don't play a lot of scary games really, but the first one that ever creeped me out was the first adventure game that I ever played, Sanitarium.
There was a level where you were exploring an abandoned mental hospital with remnants of bodies laying around.
The combination of this gross, empty hospital, the creepy music, and the main character's inner monologue definitely left me creeped out.
So those are only some of the answers, and I'm sorry I didn't read them all, but those are some of the answers from our Facebook page over at facebook.com slash orange launch radio.
Please go read the rest, because there's some great answers involving like Oculus Rift and some other stuff too, so check it out.
Going to Google Plus and reading some answers there.
The birthday boy, Actdeft, says, playing a version on PC.
It starts out sweet and nice, and then the game starts messing with you in really freaked out ways.
I played and finished the game in one sitting.
but I was alone in my house and it was getting dark too so I really got scared as I progressed through it and lastly Colin M says the PC version of Slender freaked me out sometime between finding the 5th and 6th pages my flashlight had burned out and I was basically running around in the dark before the Slenderman caught me yeah Slenderman super scary game I don't know until you've played it so many times you kind of start to figure out the patterns and it's numbed a little bit but still a really good experience
Akuma JP just made my heart leap.
There was a Ju-on game for Wii.
Was there really?
And I need this in my life.
Oh yeah, I remember that.
It was terrible.
You said it was good.
Didn't you say that?
No, I remember that came out a few years ago.
No, you just said it was scary.
And I remember telling everybody about that multiple times, especially you.
Yeah, well I don't remember that because I don't pay attention to the Wii.
It's been a while.
I need this in my life and I don't care how bad it is.
I played the Project Runway game on Wii, which was pretty bad.
But it's just a thing.
You have to try it.
I remember a scary moment when I thought my save file got corrupted.
I remember another scary moment in games.
Actually, I thought of one.
What was the Silent Hill on 360 called, the first one?
Silent Hill...
Homecoming?
Yes, Homecoming.
Homecoming was good.
With that kid.
And I was home by myself in the dark, and it was raining outside.
And you know how when you're in the hospital in the very beginning, a body falls just from the air duct or something?
It just falls down in front of you?
You go, let the bodies hit the...
Well, I screamed and jumped out of my chair.
And because it was storming outside, the front door blew open.
And I promptly, like you can even see, step one, ran, slammed the door.
Step two, closed off the Xbox without even saving.
Step three, ran into the bedroom and got under the covers and cried.
I didn't really cry, but... Lisa said it was the Xbox, because if it was, you know, the Wii or the GameCube or something, there is a potential that Rosetti may have come back and, you know, given you a nice long lecture afterwards, which is equally scary.
Now, there is a game that I mentioned in chat that I haven't heard anyone say anything about.
What's that?
Phantasmagoria.
Oh, yeah, the old PC... Which I have covered as a classic game.
Wasn't that Roberta Williams' last game or, like, one of her last games?
I think so.
Yeah, before she... But, I mean, that game was pretty...
It was way ahead of its time.
It was way ahead of its time.
And it was literally on seven or eight CDs.
It was seven.
It was all that.
That was during that phase.
We had a really quick phase in gaming.
It was right around the same time as the Sega CD.
The full motion.
Yeah, the full motion acting.
Dan and I were actually just talking about that earlier today.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I remember on the PC you had Phantasmagoria, Seventh Guest was a huge one.
And you're seeing that.
They just re-released that on Steam.
And what was the sequel, Eleventh Hour?
Eleventh Hour.
And then, of course, SimCity with SimCity Action News.
Wing Commander, The X-Files was on like eight or nine days.
Wasn't Wing Commander 3 that one?
I only remember four.
Wing Commander 3 was the one with Mark Hamill in it.
Yeah, I think so.
I believe so.
Gabriel Knight.
Gabriel Knight.
Didn't Gabriel Knight have Tim Curry?
I think it was just Acted.
Maybe it was in the sequel.
But I mean, there were tons of different horror games out that I'm sure scared people.
But going back to the day, even old text games.
I mean, being eaten by a group is pretty scary.
It is pretty scary.
Alright, let's do a few more stories in the mailbag and phone calls and all that.
So, Loki.
Alright, so the Ouya, they changed a few things.
One, they're redesigning the controller for the Ouya 2.
Yes, the Ouya 2 will be out next year.
At least that's what's planned right now.
And they're going back and redesigning the controller.
Actually, I think they've already redesigned the controller now.
And I'm kind of confused about it because I know that they redesigned the controller from when they kickstarted to when they released.
But now they're talking about redesigning it again.
And one of the questions was,
So, how am I going to know if I buy an Ouya if it's going to be the one that has a redesigned controller that's supposed to be better or the older one that the controller is not so good?
And Julie Erman said, uh, you don't know.
so that's a great answer there's no way to distinguish that and of course they're right now planning on shipping the Ouya 2 I guess sometime in 2014 and they haven't finalized a date on it yet but they're kind of investigating right now what kind of graphics chip they want to put inside there to be able to support the older games as well as push a little bit better performance out of newer games and titles
I understand them bringing out another console so that they can find their happy medium and find what's going to work and be relatively future-proof, but two consoles in two years?
I don't... Oops, here's the apology.
If they make that a trend, it just seems really stupid for something that's supposed to be an internet console.
Aren't you an iPhone user?
I... I'm just saying... Point, point, but I am still using my 4S.
And keep in mind, they're all quality products as opposed to the OUYA.
Yeah, you don't have to buy every revision.
They bring it forward because they have new things.
I'm still rocking my iPad third generation, aka the one that Apple would rather you just forget about.
You know what this is?
The only other iPad they still sell.
The iPad 2, right?
Yes.
And all I have to say...
To hell with the iPad Air.
I'm still going to rock that iPad third generation.
Do it.
That's right.
My retina display and my old school charger.
That's all I need.
Do it.
Loki's like, can I finish?
We're also talking about a $600 difference, but continue, please.
Well, here's the thing, too.
The problem, though, with coming out with an OUYA 2.0 or whatever is you're not coming out now first anymore.
Now you're coming out in potentially a field where there are going to be multiple consoles out there that do the same type of thing.
Whose features will blow yours away.
Exactly.
Who can do your thing better and for probably cheaper and...
One of the things, you know, she's basically said, oh, hey, you know what?
We're open to cloud gaming.
And, hey, we're even open to our storefront being on third-party hardware.
We'll do anything.
We'll blow anyone.
Why the fuck would I want to buy into you?
We're open to putting a flashlight in the side of the console.
And besides that, if they really wanted to be clever, they are passing up a fantastic marketing idea.
The Tuya.
I'm just saying, I'm just saying, if they put a flashlight in the side of that console, it's going to have to be for really small dick people because that is a really small console.
No, the flashlight will be bigger than the console.
So what you're saying is it'll look like a giant cylinder, aka the new Mac that they have out there.
It looks like a fucking trash can.
It's fucking expensive.
It does slightly better things than the last one.
You'll release yet another computer in a year or two that will look stupid and will do something slightly better than the other one will be fucking expensive and everyone will go
The other problem with the Ouya is that because they didn't discontinue the Wii in North America, you can get a dirt fucking cheap console here that plays a heck of a lot more games than what's really available on Ouya.
I gotta be honest, if you're out there in the market and you're like, hell, I need a system to...
Thank you for watching!
and stuff that's in the Google Play Marketplace that's free.
So why would you spend money on this stuff that has a locked out marketplace?
Put it this way.
I had the console for a while.
There are some okay games on there.
They're promising there's going to be more games on there that'll be good.
But you know what?
All those people, they're fucking not just making their games exclusive to the Wii.
It's coming out on PC and Android and all that stuff.
So you might as well just
We could use a new mic.
or buy a used OUYA, I mean, if you really want to.
I don't know.
I just don't see there's not a lot.
There's no real reason why you want to get an OUYA because they were saying before, oh, you're going to be able to run XBMC on it and stuff.
Well, except it doesn't run it very well, so why would you do that?
You can get really cheap tablets nowadays, and a lot of them already have HDMI out.
So, I don't know.
Especially with the Google thing that they have now where you can plug it into your TV and more support for apps for that.
Chromecast.
Yeah, Chromecast.
You don't really need a microconsole because a lot of other shit is doing this stuff already.
Dan and I were talking this morning about taking, because we're probably going to eventually gut our front room computer and put it in a new frame.
And I was like, well, you know people who build the Nintendo computers with the small bits?
I've wanted to do one out of a 1950s radio.
But I mean, you can build these things for yourself at home and they'll run whatever you need them to run within reason.
You know, coming by parts is just a matter of smart shopping.
Especially if you're going to make a system, if all you're interested in is emulators, you don't need that powerful of a system to run emulators.
I mean, seriously.
Get a Dreamcast.
Just buy a fucking old-ass PC.
You can probably do that.
Yeah, Dreamcast, but Dreamcast even, that doesn't run everything very smoothly.
It'll run Nintendo and... You still have to go through some hoops for that, but...
Just get an old PC.
The front room computer that we have was pretty much given to us when someone was done with it.
I think it was Dan's mom or somebody.
All we use it for is emulator games when we don't feel like busting out the Super Nintendo.
And...
Watching Netflix and Hulu.
That's it.
Also, if you're interested in buying a Ouya and, God forbid, they kickstart something else again, just remember how wonderful the Kickstarter went the first time around.
Ask up front who's shipping.
As in, as in right now, some people that backed that Kickstarter still don't have their fucking console yet.
Just saying.
And for the record...
at Radio Shack where my husband manages.
I saw laptops there that were fully equipped to do everything that we can do for 250 bucks.
You can get a laptop instead of getting that piece of garbage.
It's still not 99.
It's still not 99.
All right.
Yeah, but you get a lot more value.
I was going to say that the next one's going to be $99.
That's the other thing, too.
All right.
Moving on.
Moving on, guys.
It's another week, so there must be another story coming out of EA somewhere that's hating on the Wii U. And here we go.
Creative Director Craig Sullivan from Ghost Games.
So technically it's not EA, but you know.
So Craig Sullivan with Ghost Games is making Need for Speed Rivals and in an interview with the Six Axis talks about why it's not coming to the Wii U Rivals is going on new hardware and you have to work out where you focus your efforts The 200 people working on this game are only capable of so much and doing so many different versions of the game so we had to go with where we think the biggest audience will be for the game and that's where we are
As you may or may not know, Need for Speed Rivals is running on the Frostbite 3 engine Earlier this year we had news that they're not going to bother with putting Frostbite 3 engine on the Wii U Back when EA kind of first was talking about how they're distancing themselves from the Wii U Because the Wii U can't handle it or whatever Which means it's not going to get Dragon Age or Mass Effect It's not going to get any of that because those are all going to be on the Frostbite 3 engine as well
So there you go.
Need for Speed Rivals not coming on the Wii U anytime soon.
And, you know, stories like this are never really a great sign for that system.
But, you know, Nintendo's going to keep pumping out their games that will carry that system well enough.
And I also kind of think, I got to be really honest here when it kind of comes to the whole journalism element of this story.
I kind of think in this interview you were baiting this guy to hate on the Wii U because I think when you look at a game like Need for Speed Rivals or a lot of the stuff that goes to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One you know the Wii U can't handle that stuff like you know the Wii U is based a little more off the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 granted what's in there is a little more powerful but we all kind of know that what's inside a Wii U is not the same thing that's inside these other systems
so weren't we kind of baiting this guy a little bit isn't the answer obvious why this game is not on wii u well it's it it's like you said that they're making it for multiple consoles and so you know they only have enough okay we can only put it on x number of different consoles and so we're going to pick the ones that have you know what we think are going to be the largest market share i mean that just makes sense but yes they are masturbators
Dark Tetsuya in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, This story frustrates me because I love Need for Speed and I want a Wii U and that customization stuff would be perfect for the touchpad.
Yeah, it's kind of a bummer more people don't think to do it, but...
If only the Xbox 360 had a second screen app or something that you could use the touchpad to do customization.
If only they had that.
Didn't you listen to Bobby's show earlier tonight when our good pal Bobby Blackwolf, who always tapes before us here at VOG Network, he was talking about he went to the Xbox One preview event in Atlanta and was asking questions about...
Now I don't even remember the name of it.
Smart Glass!
I just think Smartass.
Like Smartass, like Loki, but it's Smart Glass.
You mean that app I downloaded that I've never used?
They didn't even know what it was.
Girl
It's funny because there's a lot of opportunity in theory with the surface for stuff like that.
Right.
Well, anyway.
It's like you've got all this second screen technology like slapping you in the face and still nobody wants to jump on boards.
Except Nintendo, sorta.
Although certainly there's those wank rumors that they're thinking about releasing a new Wii that doesn't have the touchpad so they can rule the bug.
Yeah, that's what I meant.
The Wii U without the touchpad.
But I don't know.
Again, wank, wank, wank, wank, wank.
I don't know how much stock I put in there.
Why?
At that point, it's like, you're taking the gimmick out, so now there's no reason.
Yeah, because that worked so well with the Wii Mini.
They took out all the extra features that you didn't really need, like internet.
Go back and focus on what made the Wii so popular.
All the flailing with the controller.
Why not?
Wii Sports HD, buddy.
It's coming.
Anyhow, let's see what the listeners think in a segment we call the Mailbag.
Every week, you guys send us emails.
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
And DarkSakura will dive into the Mailbag headfirst and find some emails that she deems worthy.
of being read here on the show.
I know we... Do I gotta... We spoiled this a little bit earlier in the show with one email, but there's still plenty more unlicked, unspoiled emails to go.
We got a bunch.
We did get a lot tonight, didn't we?
We got a couple more, actually, after checking the mail.
Oh, you don't have to read them all, you know.
Well, I'm gonna, because Gemma emailed.
Alright.
Well, you can skip his.
Shit.
You know what?
Hi, Jamie, Loki, and I guess Rob.
You see what I mean?
Yeah.
I heard Rob talking about Pokemon not really utilizing the 3D, and I was curious if you guys think it's even worth it to buy the 3DS or just go with the 2DS.
I'm still trying to decide between the two, and I would love to hear what you all think.
Thanks for making my unbearable weekend commutes less horrible gimmick.
Do you wear pants with large pockets?
No?
3DS.
Yes?
2DS.
If you have a man bag.
That's true.
Gemet probably does accessorize with a man purse.
They do have cases for the 2DS.
In all honesty, I still think the 3DS XL is the best system because the screens are still larger on an XL.
And I might also be a little biased because I really want that freaking Zelda 3DS XL that's coming out.
So I still think the XL is the best one of any of them.
But the 2DS is not a bad alternative, and it is a much lower price.
So you kind of have to just ask yourself, how much is A, a bigger screen, and B, 3D worth?
Because otherwise, functionally, they're really the same system.
But, you know, if all you want to do is play Pokemon...
Then shit, get the 2DS, it doesn't really matter But if you're thinking about the future You know, the 3D does really come in handy in some games Like Super Mario 3D Land you were talking about 3D is really useful in that game I use it actually on occasion in Animal Crossing Even though I can't keep the 3D on for very long But I use it to catch flying bugs Just because sometimes it's really hard to tell Where they are in relation to where you are Without the 3D Um
It also depends, I mean, even though I don't use the 3D, if I had a choice between the two, if someone was like, here, pick one, I'd still probably stick with the 3DS because I also like having it collapse.
I like having it close.
And that's always been something that I like because I actually adjust my screen level depending on if I'm sitting down and playing, if I happen to be in the car, which I don't really play that much in the car, but
You really do have to question some of the design choices around the 2DS.
I mean, it feels... It's intended for kids.
When it's in your hands, it feels nice.
But yeah, just the whole fact it doesn't close is... I don't know.
But I get the hinges break.
Fewer moving parts.
Yeah.
Well, on top of that, you have wires running in the hinges too.
It's just like with a regular laptop.
Sure, sure.
So you have a lot more room to make it completely unplayable as opposed to, you know, one full put together hard plastic piece.
so honestly Gemma you kind of just have to ask yourself like what how much is it worth like am I willing to pay that extra money to have the larger screens and have it close up and if that's really not a big deal to you and there's really only the one game you want to play on it then fuck it get a 2DS why not by the way Gemma says it's a messenger bag wait for a bundle with a design that you really really like and then buy that whatever it is 2D or 3D there is a Pokemon 3DS XL for what it's worth red and blue one or have wonderful wonderful friends like Slidekick
There you go.
Thank you so much.
That's the only reason I have a 3DS.
Thank you for feeding my addiction.
I love you.
What a nice boy.
Yes.
You get cookies.
Hey, Olar.
Before I go into the meat of my email, I thought I'd update my situation with Gamerscape.
This is Rostel UT.
I tried to file a complaint against them with the BBB, but they didn't seem to have a site listed in their business, and I couldn't find the address or the like, which seems to be required when submitting a complaint about a business the BBB is unaware of.
All I could get is that they're in Stockholm, Sweden.
And I'm not going to burn a chargeback over $10.
I'm not sure what, if anything, I can do about this.
I'm probably just out of luck and left telling anyone who will listen to avoid that pisshole of a site.
Views and opinions expressed by the emailer.
I don't know this site at all.
But there are businesses that do keep foreign addresses to precisely not have to answer.
Good on him for following up and putting his angry pen where his mouth is, so to speak.
What was the thing that I used to quote from some study that I did in customer service, actually?
That out of every eight people with a complaint, only one will be an advocate.
That means only one person will do something about it.
So thank you for being an advocate.
Anyway, enough of those cancers on gaming.
Wow.
Rob asked me if I consider Desura my happy alternative.
Unlike many, I don't have a real preference when it comes to services other than they offer DRM-free games.
Dessert is DRM agnostic, meaning they'll put games that publishers are absolutely adamant about DRM.
However, they do make sure to let you know that if you're getting a game that needs DRM, so I know what to avoid.
I just wish I could filter out DRM titles in search.
Other sites I use are Indie Game Stand, GOG, and Humble Bundle.
Also, I've just recently discovered that if a site is selling their game with the Humble widget, it can be linked to your Humble Bundle account, which greatly expands my options.
I found a place called Bundle in a Box.
and I haven't known of them long enough to see a bundle I want from them but I'll get back to you on that I've also looked at .emu which seems to be a GOG like service so I'll be giving them a try when I can basically I'll go wherever to get my PC games DRM free so that's my answer to Rob's question anyway I hope you guys don't mind my whining I like that he had an answer to the question so thank you
To go back to the whole GamersGate thing, if you do a Whois search on them, just type Whois in Google, type in their URL when it pops up on the GoDaddy site, it'll give you their address right there.
But as he said, Stockholm, Sweden, the actual company's name is apparently Paradox Interactive AB.
There's also Lupia AB and various other things.
But yeah, definitely registered overseas.
Somewhat out of BBB reach.
Also, P.S., when are you going to include the forums in your Fugle Question of the Week?
I, for one, don't like social media networks.
That's a fair question, but honestly our forums have not been very active at vognetwork.com and I just kind of think, I don't know, I wonder if maybe forums in general just aren't really a thing these days.
What in general would get people to participate more in the forums?
Change it to a BBS.
Like a...
Like a, you know, or do it Reddit style I am all for setting up a VOG Network BBS Where we could play games like Legend of the Red Dragon Actually, I would so be down for that That would be awesome But that has nothing to do with a freaking PHP BB So I don't know I mean, I guess, you know, the obvious answer is Well, Rob, try posting that on the forums and see what happens Or I'm also going to be honest Most of the questions I think of the day of the show And a large part of that is that we don't always know all the news Until the day of the show
So you wouldn't have a lot of time, and that's one concern I have.
And Facebook and Google, whether you love them or hate them, are always very immediate.
People check their news feed all the time and so forth, so that's what makes it attractive.
However, as a suggestion, and I myself am doing something similar, if you happen to see something from a Fugle question of the week and you feel would make a good personal editorial, why not try to submit some content?
Oh, yeah.
Send us an article if you have something to say about something that's been a Fugle question.
And, you know, assuming it's not full of accusing too many people or companies of being cancers on gaming, we might publish it.
Yeah.
We do want a little bit more diplomacy in things on our site.
And BlackWolf does have a good point.
You get more than enough answers anyway.
Tonight, we just had too many answers to read.
I'd still be reading them right now, which, don't get me wrong, love you guys for participating, but part of it is, too, that I want everybody to be able to go read all the answers themselves and just hear me rattle them off.
And three-hour show.
A three-hour show with news and not.
DarkSakura, Loki,
It's a new MMO space sim coming out from Chris Roberts and as of this email, it has raised over $24 million through pure crowdfunding.
The game looks like it's going to be amazing and has a ton of backers.
Chris Roberts is looking to make a PC game to push the PC to its limit.
Check it out at RobertsSpaceIndustries.com So that's RobertsSpaceIndustries.com
Anyway, thanks for the podcast and I hope to be able to join the live stream at some point soon.
Duran.
Oh, I saw that name in chat tonight.
Hi, Duran.
I'm glad you're here.
And I'm sorry for being disgusting in part A.
I did not recognize the game that was being discussed there, but Jason, you raised your hand.
You were like, yes, yes.
I did.
I adore this game because Wing Commander is one of the few dogfights in space or air that's been one of my absolute favorite series for the most part.
But Chris Roberts is, you know, everybody has one specific individual that a game or a company or somebody is known for in large part.
And Chris Roberts is the guy for Wing Commander.
And so he's creating a space dogfight MMO.
No MMO has grabbed me so far.
I played both Final Fantasy XI and WoW to like level 8 or 9 on my characters.
A couple days worth of playing never really went beyond that.
Thank you for watching!
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Do things for your faction.
it's unbelievable in a 3D universe of a game when you have all your controls in front of you in the form of a joystick and however much rudder or throttle or anything else that you have it has sounded amazing, I am a backer the shirt that I got is actually one of the most comfortable shirts I own right now which is very interesting but I have my badge, my ID tag it's looked absolutely phenomenal
or release sometime 2014 sorry Dungeon Buster said in a chat Roberts also did Freelancer when he had digital anvil and players essentially turned into a mini MMO with a number of mods added to it over the years and Duran just said Oculus support is confirmed nice Tim Tripp it sounds like Eve without the spreadsheets yes that is 100% correct
Looking at some other comments in chat real quick on Star Citizen.
Tim Tripp says, Star Citizen is the only game I've ever crowdsourced.
And Dungeon Buster says, Star Citizen is still on the fence with that one.
Not too keen on the MMO elements.
There you go.
Okay, moving back into the email land.
We have three.
Hi, OLR.
I had a fleeting thought the other day about how video games are constantly compared to movies as they seem to be aligning more and more in terms of narrative and visual fidelity.
Thank you for using fidelity in an email.
That makes me feel, have a little hope.
And there is a point of differentiation that I found interesting.
If a movie is considered a critical and commercial success, it's typically given many sequels.
With this, the original film seems more often than not become viewed as superior and pure version of the franchise as a whole.
Why is this not the same with video games that they are so closely connected to films?
When a video game enjoys mass success, it is given a sequel and almost instantly the original game is rendered obsolete due to the improved build of the game, engine, better graphics control, etc.
Curious to know your thoughts on this.
I'm going to put in right now and I'm going to use Mass Effect as my thing, so don't judge me.
Okay.
First Mass Effect, better story-wise than the later two.
Really?
I don't agree with that, but okay.
Okay.
I think that it was when you're introducing different writing teams and the story changes dramatically from the direction it was going in that's when I have some concerns but as far as playing the game Mass Effect 3 is lots of fun I have way much more fun actually just playing the game than I do the first Mass Effect especially since the Mako makes me want to puke
So if I'm understanding the question right, they want to know when the original is better than the sequel.
Because in movies, it tends to be that the original is better than the sequel, right?
Yeah.
Very rarely are sequels as good as the original unless you're talking about, I don't know, like The Godfather or Star Wars.
Yeah, well, Star Wars and so on.
A lot of times, too, that when you have a movie come out, typically sequels are done... I mean, except for when they're planned as trilogies.
For example, Star Wars.
The only three in existence in my brain, in my universe, headcanon.
Those tell a good story, and they're a cohesive unit.
Kill Bill was intended to be a full movie.
And the two parts are different enough.
Mm-hmm.
but they are a cohesive story.
When you have sequels that are made as cash cows, you know, oh, well, this movie did good.
Let's see if we can make some more money.
The Hangover Part 2 and 3.
Fuck.
Yeah, right.
But, you know, I think like one of the few movies that have actually done that successfully is like the American Pie series.
Those have all been kind of funny in their own bizarrely... The Scream movies.
Not everybody likes the sequels as much as I do, but...
Have you actually seen all of the American Pies?
I've seen two and part of three.
There are seven.
What?
Direct-to-video ones are awful, though.
Let's be real.
Just saying.
They exist.
I did want to watch the band count thing.
Let's go back to Dude's question because it could be female.
Sorry, but I don't know based on names if y'all are male or female.
It's a traditionally masculine name, but it could go the other way.
You never know.
So what the emailer said there, I think the question really was, have you played a video game where the sequel was not as good as the original?
I almost used this as the kickoff topic tonight.
The other one was a little more themed for Halloween, but I thought this was a great question too.
I was hoping I could hear from the three of you if there are any game series you can think of where you consider the first game to be a superior version despite multiple sequels.
Yes, I have a... I had to really think about this, but I have a great answer, I think, for this.
I have to go retro, really retro, but Blaster Master.
Oh, yeah.
The original was superior to anything that came out after it, like that horrible Genesis one.
But it had a better Japanese game.
Was it Space Fight Hyperion?
Yeah, but Blaster Master was the answer that came to my mind.
I don't know if you guys... I had more time to think about it, but you guys... Excite Truck.
Ha ha ha!
You're on that kick again.
Tim Tripp actually makes a good point and this is something I was going to bring up as well.
Typically the first game in a new IP doesn't receive the budget that an established IP.
So the big difference that comes in the amount of risk inherent in creating a new IP versus a new movie IP.
I think that is a great point and I think it's very true with games but to be fair it's also true to some extent with movies and I would point out those movies that they've made a million of like Saw as much as I hate those movies there's that right and then there's American Pie sorry Paranormal Activity you know the first one was made for like what a quarter like they smashed some kids piggy bank and made a movie with the money that was in it but then the others got like more and more budgets later on
Dragon Age 2 better than the first one so far so far
Oh, that's a good answer, though, to the question, Dragon Age.
I did see Saw 1 for whoever asked in chat.
I saw Saw 1.
I refused to watch any of the others.
I have a feeling that they always knew how it was going to end.
And I think they tied it together that way.
They always knew how it was going to end.
You know, there's a... And actually, I thought about it, but someone in chat mentioned it, too.
Android... Is that Alan?
It's Alan on his phone.
He's on light rail right now.
Devil May Cry.
The first one was better.
In my opinion, I liked it a lot better.
I am also tempted to say Silent Hill.
I think in some ways the first game is superior to anything that came after it.
Its limitations actually made it creepier.
However, Silent Hill 2 is kind of the climax of that whole series.
Yes, that's a sequel, but how many Silent Hills have there been after that?
Too many.
Oh, no, no.
There have only been a few Silent Hill games.
The others are fakes.
Yeah.
Anyway, they don't exist in my in my universe.
That was a fantastic question.
I would actually invite if you know, we do comments on this show every week at VOG Network dot com.
And I'd really invite you if you want to leave a comment.
And if your answer is good, I will get or like, you know,
of course Shane Pipeson I'll be very easy on you with this but I'll give you a thumbs up guaranteed so you get a little point on vognetwork.com if you have an answer to this question leave it on the episode posting at vognetwork.com for you podcast listeners because I want to know what games do you believe had better initial games than the sequels
See, Shane ranks the Silent Hill games as 2-4-1-3 I beg to differ 3-2-4-1 Now take that back, 3-2-1-4 Shane, admittedly, you value the room way more than a lot of people do The room wasn't supposed to be a Silent Hill game Remember?
I loved the E3 booth that they had for that game Yeah, that was my first Like the kitchen and everything?
Oh my god, that was awesome So, yeah, we still have more email
Yay!
We didn't need three extra stories.
We've got three extra emails tonight and that's fine.
Every gamer gets a voice.
Hey guys, Sterlok here.
Hi Sterlok.
With Halloween mere days away, I had a question to pose to both the hosts and listeners.
I wanted to know what game you can't finish due to one scene that spoils the rest of the game for you.
I'll give you my example.
Near the beginning of Homefront, there's a scene in which the child's parents are killed right in front of him and the child is seen crying for several seconds.
Even though I'm fairly certain no other such scenes exist in the game...
It completely kills the desire for me to see the rest of the game because that scene is just too disturbing for me to watch.
I wanted to know if anyone else had similar experiences with any games out there.
Keep being awesome, Starlock.
There's a movie that does that for me.
I can't watch Face Off.
I never played more than the start of Silent Hill 4 because the opening cinematic and the ambience just kind of completely creeped me out.
I think my head was just kind of in a weird place that afternoon and I think I literally just finished Silent Hill 3, moved on to Silent Hill 4 but I saw the opening cinematic which did the whole world shifting I did start the game, I did get control, I went to the window and I looked outside and saw the other apartment across the way, whatever but I never touched the game beyond that because for whatever reason the ambience just seemed too much for my brain and I put it down and never picked it back up again
If my name was Bobby Blackwolf, I might say, well, I played the demo to Ni No Kuni and then that scared me off for the rest of the game.
No, I can only think of a funny answer because I can't think of a serious one because I didn't see this email in advance.
It must have come in late.
I really don't know.
A game where a scene... Does it have to be disturbing or just it was bad?
Like there was something so bad happened.
I think the question, well, disturbing, bad, something that affected you in a way that made you not want to finish it.
Like me in the scene in Legend that I can't get past and have never finished the movie.
Oh, yeah.
You know what I'm talking about?
Yeah, I do.
And I'm trying to think if I have anything that's kind of like trigger-ish like that.
And for the record, I don't think I could play the game for exactly the same reason because it's kind of a very horrible thing for me.
I can't think of something.
If I think of something, I'll have to answer it on VOG Network or something because I really can't think of anything.
Loki, can you think of anything?
When you put in Excitebots and found it wasn't Psych Truck?
Uh, yeah, it was the first Mexico track, and you're playing it, and then the game asks you to throw a pie at a clown, and I was like, what the fuck is this?
I can't think of anything that really had a scene in the game that kind of ruined it for me.
I can think of a lot of games where you play through it, and the end is kind of lame.
And that kind of ruined it for me.
It's like, shit, why did I play this game?
This ending is fucking terrible.
But no, I can't think of anything that's like there's been something in the middle of the game, like a story thing where I just kind of went, what?
I don't like this.
I'm going to quit this game.
Tim Tripp in chat says, I watched The Descent once.
It was amazing, but I can never watch it again.
Yeah, I've definitely seen a lot of movies like that where it's like, I'm glad I saw it once and I will never watch that again.
I have a movie I can say I wasn't glad that I saw it, even though I didn't have to pay for it.
And that was Drag Me to Hell.
I went with Tiara to see it.
She loved it.
I just thought it was gross and not very good.
I watched Movie 43 the other day.
Very disappointed that that movie was not funny.
They showed you all the funny stuff in the trailer.
It did have a cameo, though, of Band Fuse, a game that will unfortunately sorely fail when it comes out in November.
But it had a cameo, so there's a bullet point for that.
I'm trying to see if the chatters have any they're still doing the Silent Hill debate in chat so there's not a lot of comments on it but Dungeon Buster does say I couldn't get past the bad full motion video acting in a PC game once well the gameplay was also pretty terrible too but he didn't say what game it was so I don't know but chatters if you have any answers to it let us know there was a game that I remember playing for a while that had something that made me super nauseous and I couldn't touch the game for a little while but then I went back I mean
I've had things that just shake me up right away and I'd have trouble finishing the scene.
And then once I digested it for a few days, I could go back and play it and be fine.
But I can't remember the last one.
I kind of didn't like the beginning of Alone in the Dark, the original Alone in the Dark, because it was hard.
That's about it.
Once again, nothing content related.
Mm hmm.
I mean, fuck, there was the torture scene in Grand Theft Auto V, and I was just like, how do I gold this thing?
Because I don't want to have to play this boring minigame again.
Oh yeah, that's kind of brutal too, I guess.
All right.
Well, if I think of something later, I'll let you know.
That was a good question, though.
Okay.
Last email.
I believe it's last.
It's the last as far as I'm concerned.
Last for tonight.
Hi, folks.
It's Ragenator.
Seeing as tonight's episode is the last one before Halloween is spelled with an A, dude.
Halloween.
God, he misspelled it twice.
He spelled it Halloween.
Hey, Hollow Man is a very good... Okay, it's a movie that came... I thought I'd send a Halloween theme to you.
It is all Hallows' Eve.
Hello.
Hello.
I know that since we're all pretty much in the same age group, around 35 plus or minus six years, we don't... We are age-inator.
I don't know about the listeners, but okay.
We all don't go trick-or-treating anymore.
Yes, we do.
And haven't done so in years.
Yes, we have.
Fuck that shit.
The Disneyland party is off the hook.
And for the record, some of us might have kids.
So they go trick-or-treating with their kids.
Who do you think eats all the candy in the middle of the night?
Mom!
I mean...
I don't eat all the candy I just go to Becky's house and take Julian's I mean, Becky, if you're listening, I'm not going to steal Julian's candy If you're listening, I'm not going to take Julian's candy Science, they keep giving them those stupid peanut butter cups Those things fucking suck My opinion, of course, everyone else likes peanut butter cups I know, whatever, everyone else likes that shit, but not me Tick and ten, you keep misspelling Halloween God, this is fucking irritating
But we may have certain Halloween traditions.
For me, it's watching movies that would be Halloween appropriate.
Alien, Aliens, Monster Squad.
God, I fucking love the Monster Squad.
Showgirls.
Girl.
Fist bump.
Yeah.
Ghostbusters, etc.
You are a whore, darling.
Y'all know shit.
I could do the hand thing, but I'm holding a mic.
And the same goes with games.
Nightmare Creatures, Resident Evil 1 through 3, blah.
I mean, etc.
Now my question for you is, do you do anything at all similar?
Um...
I sit at home and throw candy at kids I don't know about this year, we're going to something I know a lot of people did their Halloween party this weekend, like last night But we got invited to one that's after Halloween, so we're doing that And my costume that we bought the other day is for that But I don't know about on Halloween itself this year
Maybe I'll try to invite some people over to watch Showgirls.
That'll be fun.
Or I'll go to Jamie's.
You know what?
I seriously want to do that.
You're not doing anything on Halloween, right?
Is your thing on Halloween?
No, it's on like the 2nd.
That's it.
Showgirls party at my house.
Fuck yes.
We'll just push everything out of the room.
Can I bring over a kiddie pool and we'll reenact the pool scene with the cats?
Yes!
I don't know.
Midna might bite me.
I don't know.
No, but seriously, I'm totally down for showgirls at my house on Halloween.
You really shouldn't throttle cats like that.
With mimosas.
Rob.
Well, I have to drive home, but... I have a couch.
I gotta work on Friday, girl.
Girl.
No.
Okay, we have Mimosas early and then you can, you know, work it off doing the hand wave.
Two things.
Two random thoughts I just had here.
One, I would totally back any sort of Kickstarter related game that has to do with Showgirls.
Perhaps like, you know, a WarioWare type situation where you have all these different mini games that have to do with Showgirls.
And two, I just thought, remember they have that really retarded JibJab site or whatever where you can put your face on stuff?
They really need to put scenes from Sure Girls in there where you can just put your face on those characters because that'd be hilarious.
Oh my god, you know what I just remembered?
It would be Leo-tarded, Loki.
You know, I just remembered, you know all I know about JibJab is that This Land thing that they made with Romney and Bush.
I see those god-awful Christmas card singing elves things on Facebook.
I don't look at that shit.
The management at my work think those are so clever every fucking year.
All I know of JibJab is the year that they did This Land featuring, not Romney, what am I saying?
Who was the guy that ran against Bush that we all knew would lose?
Gore?
No.
John Kerry.
John Kerry.
The guy who looked like an ent.
Yes.
Yeah.
Yeah, that was pretty funny.
All right.
Let's see.
Going to chat room at live.vognetwork.com.
Tim Tripp suggests a Kinect-based Showgirls dance game.
Darte Suya said, do they do shadow casts of Showgirls?
Just wondering.
No.
And by the way, this is like the third time this year Showgirls has come up on the show, which has nothing to do with video games.
I guess that's what makes our show unique, if you can tolerate this chat.
But I will entertain this question because the one thing I look forward to every year in August is at the Castro Theater in San Francisco, California.
Yes.
the drag queen Peaches Christ and her yes that's her name Peaches Christ and her crew put on a midnight showing or no I guess it's more it's the Peaches Christ midnight mass I guess they bumped it up a little bit because we're all getting older it's more like this 8 p.m.
showing of showgirls and the bitch comes out of a volcano and they all do the dance to goddess and the whole thing and then they do free lap dances with a large popcorn and for like the past four or five years Alan and I have been going religiously to this thing
I want to go with you guys next year.
You came one time.
I came once, but I didn't get to go this last year.
I went the year before.
Because we went to Sausage Factory.
Which is a restaurant in the Castro.
But yes, I pretty much live for that day of the year because I love showgirls.
And by the way, Elizabeth Berkley on Dancing with the Stars.
I've been watching.
Gives me life.
Did you see the I'm So Excited dance?
Who didn't?
I know, right?
I don't even watch that show when I watch that.
Even Loki.
Oh, I was like, even Loki saw it.
You didn't see it?
No.
Oh, she did.
You remember Saved by the Bell, right?
Yeah, I remember.
I didn't even watch Saved by the Bell and I know that scene.
She did a dance related to that and they actually like.
They even had scenery.
Yeah, she was taking, she was ODing on jive pills.
It was great.
And the answer was, of course, The Jive.
Although, I will say this, the best person to ever do The Jive on that show was Stacey Keebler.
Just saying.
I'll have to look it up, I guess.
Alright, is that it for Mailbag?
It is for now.
Alright, then there you go.
Now we get to the part of the show with the FUs of the week.
We get a little angst out of our system.
Why?
Because...
F you to my state of unemployment.
Again.
I really want this job that I interviewed for.
It seems like such a great match.
I hate getting my hopes up too, so F you to getting my hopes up because the last few times I've been pretty dashed.
But I feel really positively.
I haven't heard anything back yet, so F you to the anticipation.
F you to the waiting room.
And I really, really want this to be successful.
I'd really like this job.
It would be perfect.
So, F you to oil paint as well.
and Rob just came up with an FU.
Yeah, I'm going next because I well, FU to the headache that I just went to the bathroom to get Advil for my headache and then FU to the fact that I stubbed my toe on the way back.
It fucking hurts.
Do you want ice?
No.
Kiss it, make it better.
Eh.
Loki, what's your FU?
We'll get a kitty to kiss it.
Kitty kisses make it all better.
She's hiding under the bed because she hates people.
My FU goes to the city of Folsom and their wonderful event that they had on Friday, their Night of a Thousand Pumpkins.
See, I don't go down to Old Folsom because it's like this hipster, historic area that they do events in, stuff like that.
What a bunch of douchebags.
But seriously though, they had their thing and see, I don't do that, but free trick-or-treating and stuff like that.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Thanks for watching!
F you to myself for not being able to just get on a freaking plane.
It's not hard to get around places and save a hell of a lot of time and grief.
I don't mind driving, but some days, whatever.
And there was a second one.
F you to money in general.
I hear that.
I hear that.
All right.
There it is.
The FUs of the week.
So angsty.
So fresh.
All right.
Just a few more stories for you guys.
An FU to misspell Halloween.
Poor Ragenator.
But then again, we've been picking on that guy forever.
We still love you, Ragenator.
He's used to it.
Bones did it too, but I'm just being, I just use it as a lunch.
Blame autocorrect.
That's what people do.
All right.
How is that even an autocorrect thing?
Because it's misspelled.
Shouldn't autocorrect catch that?
Calm down, Lee.
That would be hilarious to change someone's autocorrect to wrong stuff.
It learns.
Dude, my phone knows when I start to type L-U-V, it goes, love you mean it.
It knows that that's a word.
I want to know how my iPad gets all these things wrong.
It knows fuckery as a word now.
My phone knows asshattery.
By the way, I have to go with Queen Simia down with capitalism.
I will say my phone always picks either we're or were wrong and it's actually kind of really annoying.
I do have OMW turned automatically into on my way.
Everybody does by default.
Jason, some flight advice from Shane Alinko in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.
Jason, if you're afraid to fly, ask for vodka on the plane.
I told a flight attendant I was scared and she gave me vodka and orange juice and it made the flight super fun.
Thanks for watching!
and you don't live that far from Denver, right?
Right.
That's where Frontiers Hub is and they're one of those companies that I would imagine would have something like that.
Check it out.
You know what the best flight I've ever had was?
It was a Southwest flight where it was me and Julie.
We were going to Las Vegas and we got on there and they totally didn't give a fuck when they were doing the flight safety.
Sounds like Southwest.
And if you have any questions, please hesitate to answer.
If you find the plane going down, you better hold on to your ass because we're going to die.
You can see people like, and then everyone else is laughing so hard that the people that got scared were embarrassed into laughing with them.
And then the guy says, just kidding.
That's like 98%.
What's our statistics?
It was great.
That's the best flight I've ever been on.
You just need liquor and pills, Jason.
It makes it easier.
All right.
Moving on.
You know what, though?
Some people don't have the patience to do the drive or the train or anything like that.
So, you know, at least you get to see such beautiful parts of the country as Elko, Nevada.
And all of southern Wyoming across I-80.
And the no-tell motels.
You know, the whole thing about flight is, you know, trying to say, is going to the bathroom on the plane worthwhile?
Yeah.
Do I need to get out of my window seat to go pee or can I hold it?
Always go to the bathroom on the plane.
You're never going to see those people again in your entire life.
And, Gamit, there's a way for a plane to have fireball on it.
You get the little... You mean the liquor, not the... The liquor.
Yes, thank you.
They do have these little flasks that are disguised as tampons.
I kid you not, they're actually for yachts Speaking of things you do because you'll never see the other people on the plane ever again This is a video game show, right?
We will talk about that at some point Yeah, we're just talking about hijacking We just said this was a slow news week Fuck it, we're filling space True, true This is our new version of the fuck it show
Alright, we gotta get to phone calls too.
Loki's got one more story for us, then we're gonna get to the phone calls.
1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
Loki, what do you have for us?
So I guess Second Life is happening soon.
November 2nd.
You mean Extra Life?
Extra Life, whatever.
Yeah, okay.
So yes, Extra Life.
And November 2nd.
So donate, sponsor people, do all that fun stuff.
Ah, it's this weekend.
For the Children's Miracle Network.
I think it's great that this charity kind of has really embraced this whole thing and kind of really made it one of their highlight fundraisers of the year I don't know if you've seen this but on PlayStation 3 they actually have an ad for Extra Life right now and if you raise certain amounts of money you get like PlayStation rewards with that so I thought that was really cool that it all kind of like integrates together so awesome
All right.
Good luck to those of you doing Extra Life, by the way.
I'd love to do it, but my wife wouldn't let me have 25 hours of pure gaming.
We need to do something charity-related.
I have things to tell you offline.
I was going to suggest we'll probably do the MS Walk again with Horde House next year, and I'd really like OLR to get involved with that, too.
Maybe we can raise a ton of money for a great cause.
So we'll look at that.
But for now, extra life.
Good luck to those of you doing it.
I'll have to watch some of those streams myself.
Alright, we're going to go right into phone calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
We're going to skip what I had on the show roll because it was a Twitter news story and it ain't even worth it.
The more I think about it, my eyes roll so far back in the back of my head I can see my brain.
If you are dying to know what I was going to report on, that whole Sessler Gate thing.
That's all I'm going to say.
I don't even know what you're talking about.
I have no idea what that is.
Well, here I go.
No, that's perfect.
Let's talk about it.
Let's talk about it.
Come on.
Okay.
And we'll talk about how ridiculous it is.
Okay, quickly.
He's whining on Twitter because supposedly there is some thing about the new console that's going to make it hard to do his job.
Like some big thing that isn't announced yet.
And it's not Xbox One, it's PlayStation 4.
That's all been deduced.
This is Reddit, Twitter, all these, you know, folks...
I don't know if that would be it necessarily because I think when Nintendo announced that nobody got warning about that.
That just happened.
and that isn't supposed to impact review videos in fair use.
My thought is, genuinely, is that it's the PlayStation 4 preview review events because it doesn't sound like they're sending out copies of PlayStation 4 games to people.
You have to come in and play them.
And that's what they do for audio CDs and a lot of those critics have to do.
Why?
Piracy.
So... Because people ruined it.
And if you have to go somewhere else to play the game, you can't get video in advance.
That might ruin your day if you are somebody who does a lot of YouTube video reviews.
So, I don't know.
It's hard for me to feel sorry, but it certainly is an interesting challenge about the new generation.
But...
Whatever.
So there you go.
In a nutshell, there's your story.
Now we can go to the calls.
Yes.
1-877-GAME-OLR I saw a Doctor Who icon.
You better answer it.
Alright, I will.
Please call 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
You can call in now and I will take the call.
In the meantime, do we have last minute stories?
Probably not tonight.
No.
We had hardly any stories tonight.
I think you just took the last minute story.
Yeah, there you go.
I did see a couple tweets, and they were things worth mentioning, so I want to get to that.
But again, if you want to call, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or use the name on Skype, Orange Launch Radio.
I want Bobby to call.
But you excluded him in chat.
I didn't exclude him.
I said other people.
I just said we also want some new people, too.
All right.
I encourage... Let's get to the phones and see who's there.
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
Hey, what's up, guys?
This is Kaijudo.
Hey, Kaijudo.
What's up?
Long time no talk.
Hey, Dr. Who icon.
Yeah, nothing much.
I just wanted to answer the question that one of your listeners proposed to you earlier today.
How was it worded?
Where you played a game and it was so disturbing that it made you stop?
Yeah, I had a scene that made you just completely not want to play the rest of it.
Yeah, my game is Grand Theft Auto Vice City.
There's a mission in that game where I think there's like a mob boss or something.
And they want you to kill his wife.
They want you to run her off the road.
and I couldn't do that for the life of me like you you hear her like literally asking you like why are you doing this to me why are you trying to kill me it was so disturbing that I turned the game off never finished it never played it and that was back in 2002
You know, it's hard for me to sit here and go, wow, you're so crazy for that answer.
That's pretty admirable.
Yeah, you just sound like a nice guy to me.
Yeah, I mean, if it was the mob guy, I would have shot him in the face, no problem.
Lock him in the trunk, do whatever.
But I don't know.
It was just the fact that I felt she was an innocent.
You know, like when you play Grand Theft Auto.
I mean, anyone that you kill in that game, they're usually just criminals and they're either going to kill you before you kill them.
So you kind of work that out in your mind that, okay, this is justifiable.
But I don't know, just killing that woman wasn't justifiable.
I could research and see if she had a meth lab or a child smuggling ring.
Well, this was in the 80s, so there weren't any meth labs.
If anything, she was a cocaine queen or whatever the fuck.
Yeah, yeah.
It doesn't get that real.
It's just funny.
So my brain can easily differentiate.
But I can see where if this poor innocent woman is screaming her head off, like, please don't kill her.
Yeah, it's kind of like, maybe I don't want to do this.
Makes sense.
It was exactly that.
It was the fact that she was screaming and literally talking to me and asking me why.
And grant the photo, you don't talk.
So I couldn't really explain to her.
Why?
Or you're trying to explain from the couch and it's not working.
So, well, that is a great answer.
I'm curious to know if Loki remembers that part because he's the big Grand Theft Auto guy.
Um, no, I don't remember that.
I don't remember if I ever finished.
I don't ever remember finishing Vice City.
I don't know if I ever did.
Because you didn't really, really get crazy about Grand Theft Auto until just the last one, right?
I don't think I ever finished 3 or Vice City.
Maybe I did.
I don't remember.
It was a long time ago.
Loki was rocking out to the music so hard he didn't even hear it.
He didn't even hear the woman.
It's like, ooh, cheat codes.
Ooh, I'm gonna go blow stuff up.
And that was pretty much it, you know?
Same with San Andreas.
I know I didn't finish San Andreas.
And I always wanted to finish it because, I mean, I love Vice City.
I love the 80s.
I mean, it had, like, a nice vibe to it.
But just that part, man.
Couldn't get by it.
But, um...
I'm gonna hang up now, let some more calls get in Alright I was talking to you guys again, I'll be calling in more Sounds good, good to hear from you Alright, take care buddy, bye 1877GAMEOLR, our username on Skype, Orange Lingerie Did you even get to compliment the Doctor Who icon?
I think you did at the beginning I did He did have a Doctor Who icon And then the whole time during his phone call I was playing the old theme since he had the 80s icon Yeah, it was classic Who, not new Who Are you gonna go to that whole 3D screening of Doctor Who or whatever I heard about this?
No, because I hate people
Oh, that's a fair answer.
I hate going to the movies.
Like, I don't like going to opening night anything.
I don't either.
Unless it's like something I'm super excited about.
But it's like I have to see The Hunger Games.
God, catching fire.
I just don't like people that much.
I don't blame you.
Well, we like this person that's calling in right now.
Hi, are you there?
I'm right here and I'm glad you like this person.
I do like this person.
Hey, Rama, how you doing?
I'm doing pretty good.
A little tired, but I'm good.
Yeah, was there a con this weekend?
No, but I work, and now my commute, instead of being from Brooklyn to Midtown Manhattan, is from Brooklyn to Jersey, so three-hour commute every single day.
Oh my gosh.
But I was going to say, as far as the anime cons go, too, Halloween is the one time of the year where you're supposed to dress up, so it's like, it's cosplayers' vacation.
Yeah.
or as I like to call it, National Cosplayer Zen.
Fair enough.
You know I'm just teasing you.
I'm all for it.
What else is on your mind, buddy?
Three things, and I'll make it quick.
Number one, and this is a frugal question of the week.
I'll make this part brief.
I was playing Bioshock, going through the level.
My old roommate was standing there with his D&D crew, and they watched me play the game.
I come to this one section where there is a casket sitting on a shelf.
I'm like, okay.
I walk over to it, the casket explodes, there are creatures coming at me, I'm killing them, and I'm like, what the fuck is this?
Holy shit, what the fuck?
I kill them all, and I'm just staring at the screen, I pause it, and I drop the controller, and it's like, fuck this, I'm done.
Well played, Bioshock, well played.
Well, there you go.
That is a scary game that nobody brought up earlier, so, good answer.
Yeah, but mind you, I was playing with the lights on.
What else is on your mind, buddy?
Anyone?
Anyone?
No, I was just saying, what else is on your mind, buddy?
My bad, my bad.
Second thing, this was passed to me by someone on my fan page, and they're spreading the words of their Extra Life campaign out of Ohio.
Happy Family and Friends
They have not mentioned, but they did say there's going to be a lot of video games, anime, Kevin Smith, crude humor.
Did I mention Kevin Smith?
Is Kevin Smith going to be there or are they just watching Chasing Amy?
Nobody watches Chasing Amy.
I thought you knew this.
Fuck you.
I love that movie.
Hey!
See, you're a traitor.
I will let you slide on it because you didn't say Jersey Girl.
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Yeah, I already told him this.
Now, I'm going to let you guys know.
As you know, I have this issue with Shamestop and how I refuse to give them my money for the way they treat some of their customers and their products and this and that.
Or their employees.
Yep, them too.
Long story short, old roommate reimbursed me money for a game that he can't find.
So I go buy a used copy.
I go in, they have like this special
So what made you decide that ethically you're going to decide, okay, I'll boycott GameStop most of the time?
I figure I might as well get a good deal on a used game as long as I have the game, the manual, and the original box art.
If not, I'll go to Amazon and spend an extra ten bucks.
I mean, eventually you just can't boycott fully forever.
Eventually you get to that point where you know what?
Might as well.
I'm just going to go in, get what I want, and leave.
As long as they don't ask me for power rewards, as long as they don't ask me to reserve this or that, I just want the game, and I want to go.
That's part of the reason I like Amazon, because like Jamie, I don't like people sometimes.
And Amazon, you just click your thing, or any online site, really.
I know I keep pimping that one, but you just go on, you order what you want, and then it magically shows up at your door.
It's great.
At least you don't have to deal with this.
You go into the store to buy something, headphones are on, and they're talking to you like you can hear them.
Right.
You can kind of hear them, but you know the transaction, what you're doing, so you just want them to just pull up the screen, you can punch in your rewards card, pay for your item, and leave.
Alright, well Ranma, I'm going to let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thank you as always for the call.
Ain't no problem, broski.
And everybody listen to Anime Jam Session.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Never.
I was like, Ranma, what the fuck is going on?
Okay, for the year.
That makes sense.
I think my funeral services might be at a con.
That's how much of a con whore I am.
Ranma, not that I want to talk about that day anytime soon, but if I happen to still be here when that happens, I will see to it that the fucking kids pay their respects to the great Black Luigi.
Will we be putting up the death note with your name in it?
This time, I will allow it.
All right.
Take care, buddy.
For the record, one last thing.
Every time I see someone refer to SNK, I don't think of the anime.
I think of my and all the King of Fighters games.
I always think of Capcom versus SNK, too, which is me.
I keep thinking of Shingeki no Kyojin.
I just start reading the manga.
It's phenomenal.
Yeah, I don't think I'm gonna.
SSJ100 Matt sent us a few tweets this one you sent us about Neon FM was in last week's show just a heads up but the other one is about the Conan O'Brien thing where he played the scary games I've seen the tweets about this I haven't watched this yet but I'll have to check this out I don't want to play it over the air because you know it's Conan's thing but check that out I'm sure it's hilarious because Conan is hilarious and I paid a lot of money to see him live after he got kicked off of NBC and it was worth every penny so good times
So check that out.
He plays Slender the Eight Pages and Amnesia, and I'm sure it's great.
TigerClaw sends us a few tweets.
Classic games are now preserved and accessible on Archive.org.
How does this work?
Because isn't emulation kind of a gray area?
I'm trying to read about this.
The Internet Archive has created the Historical Software Archive, which is significantly older software runnable in a browser, which includes many games.
Thanks to J.S.
Mess, the multi-emulator super system available in Java Jason Scott from the Internet Archives site says We have the ability to watch video, listen to music, and read documents right in our browsers Not so with classic software until now Included in the collection are games such as Mystery House by Roberto Williams
Karataka by Jordan Mechner.
I remember that game.
And Atari's infamous E.T., the extraterrestrial.
I had no idea.
Like, does the copyright lift on this after so many years?
I thought it was like 75 years and then some.
Because the Disney laws keep getting passed to keep Mickey Mouse out of public domain.
They might not have renewed that one.
I guess that's true.
Who cares?
Or maybe because emulation is such a gray area, because these games are so old, like maybe it's just not a big deal.
I don't know.
But that's still pretty cool.
I'll check that out after the show.
One other quick tweet here from Tigerclaw.
It's about the Mortal Kombat film director who
Kevin Tancho-Rowan I'm totally mispronouncing that name, sorry He's the director of Mortal Kombat Legacy and he has walked away from it He talked about it on Twitter He did the Mortal Kombat Legacy web series and that was after Mortal Kombat Rebirth New Line Cinema actually asked him to direct a future film in the Mortal Kombat universe but he said, quote After three years of combat, I've decided to move on to other creative opportunities I wish everyone involved in the movie a big success Thanks
I can see that.
Three years is a long time to spend on one project.
You might not want your life and your career defined by the one thing.
So I can see that.
Speaking of video games becoming movies, you know, BlizzCon is in two weeks, and there's going to be lots of Warcraft movie news that comes out of that, I'm sure.
I think they cast their first person, too.
I think I remember seeing a story on that, too, that their first official person is cast in that.
Oh, I know TigerClaw tweeted that at some point, but I don't have it up on the screen right now, and it is live radio.
I think it's probably on the Horde House page.
I'm sure it got posted there.
Trying to find it right now.
Ah, I can't bring it up.
I don't remember the guy's name.
Maybe somebody will yell it out in chat.
But it was from some Viking thing on TV.
I didn't recognize the name of the guy.
There was stuff about Colin Farrell in the past.
Yeah, those are rumors.
Him and Paula Patton, who is Robin Thicke's wife.
is rumored for that movie too we don't know who they're playing though they haven't said anything about that so alright we'll get into more of that on Horde House but for now this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio Travis Fimmel thank you thank you this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio is about to an end hey I want to thank you guys for tuning in and listening to the show thank you for supporting our little podcast that we do here every week we do this for you guys you're great and if you like what you hear here at Orange Lounge Radio please just help us spread the word

Thank you for the washer and dryer.
Alright, anyway, your final thoughts, sir.
Wow, what is my final thought?
Hurry to driving, another...
Thank you for watching!
and then I have to figure out what my Thanksgiving plans are going to be.
But if I do come back to San Francisco, that means I'm going to do the 22-hour drive I-80 back home because that's the only one that makes sense.
Well, maybe we'll see you right back here on OLR next month.
Quite possibly.
You're always welcome at the house anytime, Jason.
All right.
Let's see.
How about DarkSakura?
Your final thought.
Man, there's... Ed.
Ed, move out.
Fuck Ed.
That's the final thought.
I'm absolutely irritated and I'm just having all three characters in my village ignore Ed because fuck him.
Not really because he's disgusting.
I'm sorry you don't wear purple eyeshadow when you're blue.
It just doesn't work.
And you don't give people jackhammers I'll tell all the Smurfs I know your fashion tips You know what?
Okay No, mine is This has been the night for nostalgia Because, you know, Pokemon and rival schools But then Ikuma You are wonderful, Ikuma-san But you had to mention Last Blade And I love that series So I want a new Last Blade game too
My final thought tonight is fuck this headache and bless that bottle of wine that I'm going to get to open because Alan was able to get home a little earlier.
Because you want a bigger headache.
That's right.
Thank you, Alan, for running and making light rail.
He can't hear me.
He has headphones on.
All right.
Oh, no.
Here he is.
He came out and said, you're welcome.
Thank you, Alan.
Rob, we bred.
Finally.
Yay, Jamie.
We made it.
Wait.
Scratch that.
Loki, last but not least.
We breed puzzle pieces, remember?
Loki, last but not least.
Your final thought.
My final thought is I'm still acquiring pieces for my portable screen thing.
I've actually been using that screen quite a bit at work, because that's what I play on my PlayStation 3, so it's working out really good.
And I'm now trying to find an audio amp, which I'm going to go with an old USB speaker, and the battery, which I have one picked out already, and now a DC converter.
So...
and then I just need to design a case and vacuum form that bitch.
Which will be hard.
Good luck.
The virtual boy looks so weird.
I love my virtual boy hat.
I love it.
Alright, that's really it.
We're done.
We're out of here.
Thank you guys very much for listening to our show.
We'll be back next week to do it all again.
Episode 526.
Until then, Jason, take us out.
You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio
See you next week!
