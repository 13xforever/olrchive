00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:13.000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
Tonight, August 11th, 2013

00:16.000 --> 00:19.000
Could Valve finally be making a sequel with a 3 in it?

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
One department store ad teases a Vita price drop

00:22.000 --> 00:26.000
And is Amazon working on a new gaming console?

00:27.000 --> 00:30.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
Hello everybody out there on the internet

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
And welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
It is Orange Lounge Radio

00:38.000 --> 00:43.000
Episode number 515 for this, August 11th, 2013

00:43.000 --> 00:46.000
My name is Rob Roberts and I'm here to talk about video games

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
Gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle, gaming lulz, gaming...

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
Insert whatever here

00:51.000 --> 00:54.000
With my co-hosts, say hello first off to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
Hey how you doing?

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
I'm unemployed again

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
I'm sorry to hear it, that's...

01:00.000 --> 01:03.000
I feel better about it once the situation became clearer to me

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
I see, so it was one of those, maybe we are better off seeing other people

01:06.000 --> 01:10.000
Let's just put it this way, I don't want to work for a hypocritical conservative Christian company

01:10.000 --> 01:13.000
That ruins other people's businesses

01:13.000 --> 01:19.000
Well it is important to, you know, work for an employer that you can kind of get behind their values and all that stuff

01:20.000 --> 01:25.000
They had a really good environment there but once I found out a bit more about them

01:25.000 --> 01:28.000
I really started to feel very uncomfortable

01:28.000 --> 01:32.000
I was like, what's that sticker on your car? What's that equal mean?

01:32.000 --> 01:36.000
Oh it's for the human rights campaign, I support gay rights

01:36.000 --> 01:40.000
Oh! Next day, fired

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
That's pretty much how it went

01:42.000 --> 01:46.000
I'm not laughing at you, I'm just laughing at the awkwardness of that

01:46.000 --> 01:52.000
It was quite awkward, that and also actually requesting the major Jewish holidays off that morning

01:52.000 --> 01:55.000
And they said, oh we made the decision this morning, you're just not a good fit

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
Oh dear

01:57.000 --> 02:01.000
So I'm not actually openly accusing them of anything, I'm just saying that those are the circumstances

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
Well you can just work for vognetwork.com full time

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
You know what, if it paid me I would be really happy

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
Except, oh yeah, there's that, sorry about that, we don't have a budget

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
Oopsies

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
Alright, say hello as well to Techmaster Loki

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
You there, Loki?

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
Yeah

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
What are you doing over there, Loki?

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
I was pulling up my stories

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
Oh, I see, trying to get prepared

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
Now that's a little late, that's alright

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
How you doing, what's new?

02:25.000 --> 02:28.000
Not much, just, I was watching some

02:28.000 --> 02:31.000
What was it, a...

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
Mugen fighting thing

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
Yeah, I think it's coming up later in the show, right?

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
Yeah, so

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
Alright

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
It was pretty funny

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
A little obsession of yours through the past week or so?

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
Nah, just the last couple days

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
Way to kill some time

02:44.000 --> 02:48.000
Yeah, so any big personal news you might want to share with listeners tonight?

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
Yeah, I guess

02:50.000 --> 02:54.000
So, we're having another child

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
Congrats

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
In January

02:58.000 --> 03:01.000
That's amazing, how many weeks along does that make, Nelly?

03:01.000 --> 03:04.000
16, 17

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
I guessed it on a show this morning

03:06.000 --> 03:09.000
And one of the hosts announced that his wife's expecting

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
So that's babies everywhere!

03:11.000 --> 03:12.000
Yeah

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
For the record, I'm not pregnant

03:14.000 --> 03:17.000
Not yet, careful what you wish for

03:17.000 --> 03:20.000
No, I'm gonna time against my biological clock

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
I'm gonna sabotage that motherfucker

03:22.000 --> 03:25.000
I'm selling my ovaries

03:25.000 --> 03:28.000
How much could you get for those?

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
Actually about 10 grand each

03:29.000 --> 03:33.000
Alright, in all seriousness, Loki, congratulations to you and Mrs. Loki

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
Thank you

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
Good luck with all that

03:35.000 --> 03:38.000
Having another kid, it's gonna be a busy, busy household

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
Yep

03:39.000 --> 03:42.000
And there are some congrats being shown in our chat room

03:42.000 --> 03:46.000
We do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern

03:46.000 --> 03:49.000
Right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at the Voice of Geeks Network

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
vognetwork.com

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
Again, that's vognetwork.com

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
6 o'clock Pacific, 9 Eastern on Sundays

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
Lots of great podcasts for you to participate with

03:59.000 --> 04:03.000
And geeky content, including articles, audiobook reviews

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
And movie reviews and movie rankings

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
And lots of other fun stuff coming soon

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
VOG is gonna have a big presence at Dragon Con

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
And I'm very excited about that

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
My first time in Atlanta

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
So I hope to see some of you guys there

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
Also joining us on the show tonight

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
We have a guest here

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
A frequent guest of the show

04:20.000 --> 04:23.000
It probably helps that, you know, the show's at his house too

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
Everybody say hello to Alan Alchemy

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
Hello

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
How you doing Alan?

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
I'm great

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
You're great

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
I just want to make sure we can hear you tonight

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
So how have you been lately?

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
I've been alright

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
Yeah?

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
Decided to finally guest on the show again after like a year

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
Gracing us with your presence

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
It's appreciated

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
Alright, what's new with you personally?

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
Not much

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
Yeah?

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
Usually when I'm either working, I work swing shift

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
So I'll listen to OLR from work

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
Or when I'm not working and you guys are all here doing the show

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
I'll kind of just play video games in the office

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
Or fold laundry or just be domestic

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
Yeah

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
So I decided I'd sit in on the show tonight

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
Okay

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
Well, I know we're gonna talk about your gaming week a little bit later

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
But like in general, what kind of games have you been catching up on lately?

05:00.000 --> 05:05.000
Most of the stuff, if it has a Steam trading card thing in it

05:05.000 --> 05:08.000
Then I've checked it out either a little bit

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
Or you know that trick?

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
If you don't want to play the game, you can just let it run

05:12.000 --> 05:16.000
And then go take a shower, go watch TV and come back and have your cards drop

05:16.000 --> 05:19.000
So you got sucked into this whole Steam trading card thing too

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
Yes

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
Like I did

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
What's the allure of it?

05:22.000 --> 05:29.000
It's just, it appeals to my sort of OCD completionist

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
You know

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
Yeah

05:32.000 --> 05:35.000
And the thing is, is you can earn each badge like five times

05:35.000 --> 05:38.000
So once you earn, once you go like, yeah, I got all the cards

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
Clarity badge, okay, now do it again

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
Steam's like, do it again

05:42.000 --> 05:45.000
Spend some, put some money in your wallet, buy the cards

05:45.000 --> 05:50.000
I am eligible for the booster packs for like I think 13 or 14 games

05:50.000 --> 05:55.000
And I still have about maybe 15, 16 more that I still need to play to get the things to drop

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
Not a single booster pack yet

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
Yeah, I've not gotten anything either

05:59.000 --> 06:00.000
But then again, I haven't really been playing much

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
I got my second one yesterday

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
Yeah, I'm pressed like a panini, I hate you

06:04.000 --> 06:07.000
I have a foil card for Saints Row the Third

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
Oh nice, you can sell those for a little more money

06:09.000 --> 06:13.000
I forgot who I was talking to but someone needed all three of the only cards that I had

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
So I'm just like, here take them

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
Wait, how did you get a foil card if you haven't gotten any booster packs?

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
I get, it was one of my randoms that guy

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
Really? Oh, I didn't know that

06:20.000 --> 06:21.000
Those will drop, yeah

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
Oh, okay, well that's never happened to me

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
So that's something you have up on me

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
There you go

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
There you go

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
See, the problem is I don't know where to buy and sell those cards

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
I don't know where that's

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
It's the community marketplace

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
Yeah, I have no idea how to get through that

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
Oh, it's easy, it's, oh, believe me, they make it easy

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
We can show you

06:36.000 --> 06:39.000
It's really a brilliant thing if you make about it

06:39.000 --> 06:42.000
And it totally plays to people like Alan, and myself admittedly

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
Who have that OCD need to collect something

06:45.000 --> 06:46.000
Why?

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
Cause you can

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
Because

06:51.000 --> 06:55.000
Since we were playing earlier this week I thought I might actually have to get a hat

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
And so

06:59.000 --> 07:03.000
Well, let's talk about some of the things that, you know, we were off last week because I was away at GamerX

07:03.000 --> 07:10.000
So let's, I want to talk about GamerX, but I want to talk about the other stuff that's gone on in the past couple weeks

07:10.000 --> 07:13.000
One is that, I don't know how it happened

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
Christopher

07:14.000 --> 07:17.000
Was it Christopher? I guess Christopher did kind of start

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
Wasn't he doing like a review or something?

07:18.000 --> 07:21.000
Yes, he wanted to review it for Horde House

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
And to be fair, that was ActDeaf kind of poking at him

07:24.000 --> 07:28.000
Which he's been kind of poking all of us for a while going, hey, play Team Fortress 2

07:28.000 --> 07:29.000
Hey, play Team Fortress 2

07:29.000 --> 07:33.000
And then Phil from Koopa Club I think got in on that a little bit

07:33.000 --> 07:34.000
Hey, play Team Fortress 2

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
Play it, do it, do it

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
And finally Extro was like, fine, is it free?

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
Yes, I'll try it

07:38.000 --> 07:44.000
And so we all played one night on, I guess ActDeaf has this server, abandoned server he knew of

07:44.000 --> 07:47.000
So a bunch of us played on there and loved it

07:47.000 --> 07:51.000
We had so much fun, like it was just so much fun just sitting there blowing people up

07:51.000 --> 07:54.000
And it was great because you don't have to worry that you're not good enough

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
Or that people are going to yell

07:55.000 --> 07:59.000
It was just a lot of like-minded people having a good time just shooting the shit out of each other

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
And I was like, oh, I got to get us a server

08:01.000 --> 08:02.000
We need our own server

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
We need a VoG server for this

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
We have a Minecraft server sometimes

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
Why can't we have a Team Fortress 2 server?

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
As a trial run

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
Yeah

08:09.000 --> 08:10.000
Test it out

08:10.000 --> 08:14.000
So I remembered I had like $100 sitting in a PayPal account somewhere I hadn't used

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
So I was like, alright

08:15.000 --> 08:18.000
Oh, just a random $100 sitting aside

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
All my money

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
When he pointed it out, I was like, that must be nice

08:22.000 --> 08:28.000
Well, you know what though? It's the modern day equivalent of burying it in your backyard

08:28.000 --> 08:32.000
And I was like, you know you haven't been earning interest on that in a year and a half, it's been stuck in there

08:33.000 --> 08:37.000
Well, you know what? It came in awfully handy this week, didn't it?

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
So I bought us a Team Fortress 2 server

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
Actually, the server was only like $20

08:41.000 --> 08:44.000
So I got that, it's like a 12 person server

08:44.000 --> 08:50.000
And all of the information is available on our website, VoGnetwork.com

08:50.000 --> 08:56.000
Look at the forums and you can check out the information that's in the video games forum

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
All the info you need about the server is there

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
You might need a little help with the password

09:00.000 --> 09:05.000
But let me just remind you guys, we used to have a little mascot, a little ferret on the show

09:05.000 --> 09:08.000
That's on my bedside table sitting on Duffy's head

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
Yes, DarkSakura abducted it

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
It doesn't work anymore

09:12.000 --> 09:15.000
And no, I do not have the hero's cap, I need it

09:15.000 --> 09:18.000
Just in case you need that information when you look at the post

09:18.000 --> 09:21.000
And it is password protected, but if you ever check it out

09:21.000 --> 09:26.000
Like in your Steam client, you see a bunch of jerks on there with screen names that you don't recognize

09:26.000 --> 09:29.000
You should let Rob know and he can spin the password to something else

09:29.000 --> 09:34.000
Absolutely, because we want it to be the welcoming environment for people that are like

09:34.000 --> 09:39.000
I want to play Team Fortress 2, but I don't know anybody and I'm not very good at shooters

09:39.000 --> 09:42.000
No one is really good at Team Fortress 2

09:42.000 --> 09:46.000
It's too fast, it makes me feel old because I was the soldier class with the shotgun

09:46.000 --> 09:49.000
And I was in the same room with someone, strafing

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
I couldn't hit someone with the shotgun

09:51.000 --> 09:54.000
And they killed me, I was like, I have a shotgun in your face, I can't hit you

09:54.000 --> 09:58.000
I feel a little silly that I'm just now getting into this game that's like, what, five years old?

09:58.000 --> 09:59.000
It came out with Orange Box, right?

09:59.000 --> 10:04.000
I think I played it a little bit on Orange Box on 360, but it's not even the same like now on PC

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
It just feels so different

10:08.000 --> 10:11.000
I should probably play that, but I've had other things on my plate

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
You also might get your little sicky-sick

10:13.000 --> 10:16.000
I feel like it plays most like OG Quake to me

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
Although it's more cartoony

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
Which, duh, it makes sense

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
I mean, Team Fortress 1 was a Quake mod

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
The speed of it reminds me of Unreal Tournament

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
Which I loved

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
Oh yeah, that's true

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
Definitely some more games throughout the week

10:29.000 --> 10:32.000
Alan and I would love to play tonight, but we have errands to run after the show

10:32.000 --> 10:35.000
But that might not stop other people from playing after the show

10:35.000 --> 10:39.000
Active in our chatroom says Team Fortress 2 is around seven years old

10:39.000 --> 10:42.000
Oh my gosh, really? Holy moly

10:42.000 --> 10:45.000
Alright, speaking of other games and things

10:45.000 --> 10:48.000
Dark Soccer, well, I guess it's bugging out right now

10:48.000 --> 10:51.000
But you were trying to open your Animal Crossing town for the first time

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
I had three people in there and the connection crashed

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
So I'm gonna open it one more time, but if it does it again

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
I'm gonna have to leave it closed for the rest of the show

10:57.000 --> 11:00.000
Because our primary concern is keeping our bandwidth open

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
Yeah, it is, that is, so we don't want to

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
But it would be fun if you want to go visit Jamie

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
You got the VOG pattern, right?

11:06.000 --> 11:09.000
I did, but it won't let me put it on, so I think I just have to recreate it

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
Well, Bobby's pattern's probably better anyway, so

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
Go get the one from his town

11:13.000 --> 11:16.000
But no, I actually can't use something that I got from somebody else

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
I'll have to make it myself

11:18.000 --> 11:19.000
Dope

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
It's fine

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
Alright, so there's that Animal Crossing going on

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
And then Minecraft coming back at some point, right Loki?

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
Yeah, I want to get around to it

11:26.000 --> 11:29.000
Alright, so we want to know what other games should VOG have a server for?

11:29.000 --> 11:32.000
We'll look into it if you have a serious request

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
Something that we ought to check out, let us know

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
Free to play is really good too

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
That's what makes Team Fortress 2 so great

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
Because it's free to play

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
And people even make a little money off it, right?

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
Getting the item drops and crafting and all that

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
I mean, not anything to write home about

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
But, you know, something to buy trading cards with, right?

11:49.000 --> 11:53.000
Alright, so we missed the show last week

11:53.000 --> 11:56.000
Because I was at GamerX

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
And Alan was there with me

11:58.000 --> 11:59.000
Yay

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
Which was great

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
And if you haven't heard about GamerX

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
Although I'm pretty sure I've talked about it ad nauseam on the show

12:05.000 --> 12:08.000
GamerX was a Kickstarter backed convention

12:08.000 --> 12:14.000
To really just be a safe place for GLBT gamers

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
But it's really important to know

12:16.000 --> 12:19.000
The con was not only for GLBT gamers

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
And I think I went on this tangent

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
It might have been on Horde House

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
But it always pissed me off when I heard people going

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
Well, where's our straight gamer convention?

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
Why can't we have a straight gaming convention?

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
And I'm like, well, okay

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
That's what YowieCon is for girls

12:33.000 --> 12:36.000
When y'all are getting disowned by your parents

12:36.000 --> 12:40.000
And getting lost past in states that affect your lifestyle

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
And people are bullying you

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
And calling you names on Xbox Live

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
Then you can have your little convention

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
But otherwise it's a 365 day a year convention

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
The point was not to be like

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
Gaze only and everybody else get out

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
It was to be a safe environment

12:56.000 --> 12:59.000
Just like I described the Team Fortress 2 server

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
Is a safe environment for people

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
Who are bad at Team Fortress 2

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
It's creating a safe place

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
Where people are not gonna be screaming

13:07.000 --> 13:10.000
FAG FAG N-word N-word

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
It's like, bro

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
When you play Halo and you have to turn off

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
Everyone else's mics because you get sick and tired

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
Of being called a breeder a hundred times a match

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
Then come talk to us

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
We'll talk about a straight convention

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
I don't think that's happening

13:24.000 --> 13:28.000
The bullying is bad enough with gay, lesbian, and bisexual

13:28.000 --> 13:31.000
And then throw transgender into it

13:31.000 --> 13:35.000
It was very eye-opening in some of those panels

13:35.000 --> 13:38.000
To hear what transgendered people go through

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
In games and so forth

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
It was really eye-opening

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
I had a marvelous time at the convention

13:44.000 --> 13:48.000
It was honestly something I kind of never thought I would see

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
So it made me just very happy to be there

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
I did have some small reservations

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
It was a first-time con

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
And so there were some first-time con issues

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
But I want to just make sure I am crystal clear

13:58.000 --> 14:01.000
It was really good for a first-year con

14:01.000 --> 14:02.000
Beyond really good

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
My minor issues were

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
One, the space was too damn small

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
Although the Hotel Kabuki in San Francisco is lovely

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
And I loved that it was in Japantown

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
So all that stuff was nearby

14:12.000 --> 14:16.000
It was just a clusterfuck of people downstairs

14:16.000 --> 14:19.000
I actually had a panic attack from claustrophobia

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
That has never happened in my life

14:21.000 --> 14:25.000
But because the lines were spiraling around

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
And there were a few exits

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
You were in a basement

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
I just suddenly pictured

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
What happens if this place gets caught on fire?

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
And I literally had the whole high blood pressure

14:35.000 --> 14:36.000
And all that stuff

14:36.000 --> 14:37.000
I had to get out of there

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
So thankfully I did

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
Once you could make it into a room

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
Whether it was the exposition room

14:43.000 --> 14:44.000
Or the gaming room

14:44.000 --> 14:45.000
Or a panel room

14:45.000 --> 14:46.000
You were fine

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
But the people waiting in line

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
Plus the through traffic

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
Because people got to get from point A to point B

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
They don't give a shit about a panel

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
Waiting in line if they're not interested in the panel

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
And the hallways for that

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
Were only maybe two or three people wide

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
And the ceilings were really low

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
Like only 10 or 11 feet

15:03.000 --> 15:06.000
So it was really just claustrophobic and gloomy

15:07.000 --> 15:08.000
Which you know what?

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
I'm sure when they looked at the space originally

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
And kind of had their thought

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
What it was going to be in their head

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
What a terrible problem to have

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
That your con is too popular

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
So next year

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
They have said it's coming back next year

15:21.000 --> 15:22.000
And I'm pretty sure they said

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
They are looking into a bigger space

15:24.000 --> 15:25.000
Although I don't know if that necessarily meant

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
They were looking at a different space

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
I kind of got the feeling that they might just spread it out more

15:29.000 --> 15:30.000
I don't know

15:30.000 --> 15:31.000
We'll see

15:31.000 --> 15:34.000
The Hotel Kabuki has hosted different cons before

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
And what they count on I think

15:36.000 --> 15:39.000
Is that a lot of that traffic is going to start going into the Kintetsu Mall

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
To go shopping at Kinokuniya

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
Or go get crepes or whatever

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
Maybe they'll spread it out across different hotels

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
And Japan Video really likes it

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
Because they do a lot of business during that

15:49.000 --> 15:50.000
Oh yeah

15:50.000 --> 15:51.000
It was great

15:51.000 --> 15:52.000
The environment was great

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
The Japanese street fair was going on

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
The overflow for the con

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
Was always in that mall

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
So yeah it was already kind of a part of the circuit

16:00.000 --> 16:03.000
So my other bit of creative feedback

16:03.000 --> 16:06.000
Would be that Alan and I went to the Friday night party

16:06.000 --> 16:09.000
Which was for the VIP Kickstarter folks

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
Because yeah I did kickstart a bit of money into this

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
Because I really wanted to see it happen

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
So we went to the Friday VIP party

16:15.000 --> 16:16.000
Which was fine

16:16.000 --> 16:17.000
Music talent was great

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
Let's say that

16:18.000 --> 16:19.000
Music talent was great

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
I know some of VX JasonXV's friends were

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
They had a Chiptunes DJ

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
That sounds cool

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
Yeah they were really good

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
But the host of the evening was Pandora Box

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
And she was a contestant on RuPaul's Drag Race

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
Full disclosure I loved her

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
Rooted for her all through that season

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
Ditto

16:35.000 --> 16:36.000
And I've even

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
On the fun little side project

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
RuPaul's Drag Race podcast I did with the Game Buoy guys

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
I even defended her many times

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
And I do love her and follow her on Facebook

16:44.000 --> 16:47.000
But maybe Alan you can describe this better than I can

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
What the issue was with Pandora

16:49.000 --> 16:53.000
Well you know it's supposed to be an inclusive convention

16:53.000 --> 16:56.000
A lot of people had aired concerns online

16:56.000 --> 16:59.000
That it was just going to be a bunch of white gay dudes

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
Because that's what San Francisco is really

17:01.000 --> 17:05.000
And we were going to shut out the BLT portion of the convention

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
So she gets up there

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
And within like a minute she's talking about

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
There are lesbians play video games?

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
Ew I don't like vagina

17:13.000 --> 17:14.000
And everyone's laughing

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
Once I was born and fell out of one I was done

17:16.000 --> 17:19.000
And it's like okay gay men don't like pussy

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
That's your joke

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
Which is like really insulting

17:23.000 --> 17:26.000
I hate when I hear my peers say it

17:26.000 --> 17:27.000
It's like really?

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
Yeah and then she was kind of going after the nerd thing too

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
Like oh yay we're having this convention

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
You guys can get out of your basement for the first time in a year

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
And I'm just kind of like

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
I don't know I'm torn because I understand

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
I understand drag queens are supposed to be bitchy

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
Like that's their whole thing

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
You know so I should just like kind of roll my eyes and do whatever

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
It's like a big roast

17:46.000 --> 17:49.000
Haha nerds in basement that's the first time I've ever heard that joke

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
Exactly yeah that's totally original

17:51.000 --> 17:52.000
I was just kind of like

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
Dude you are like the first thing

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
At the first con

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
Of this first great thing

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
And that's what you're going to do with it?

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
And everyone in that room had donated

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
I'm sorry it was 100 bucks right?

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
Yeah something like that

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
So I was just a little bit like

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
And then she started talking about Grindr

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
Nerds are introverts here all on Grindr right now

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
And it's like they'd probably be on Grindr anyway

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
Haha you're on Grindr bitch

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
Haha

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
So I don't know I just was kind of

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
I was over her

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
It wasn't the best

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
I wasn't a fan of her I didn't like go home and unfollow her on Facebook

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
Or something I was so mad

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
But I was just like that was a little lazy

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
Her cosplay was good

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
That I'm sure her team put together for her

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
She didn't know what the fuck she was wearing

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
Shade

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
Well alright enough negative

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
Because honestly lots of positive

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
You know I was just in my basement in Animal Crossing

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
Haha we did a panel there

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
Podcast Cross Zone and had a lot of fun

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
And I just want to give a shout out

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
And big hearts to the guys

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
From Koopa Club

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
From Game Bar

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
From GameBui.org

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
Which I'm sure everybody was reciting that URL

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
At the end of the day after that panel

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
To Fox Van Allen from Wow Insider

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
And the Techlicious

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
Is that the one he writes for? I look really stupid right now

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
I forget which one he writes for but

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
He was a great moderator

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
And the other folks that came

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
To the panel

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
I was really worried no one was going to show up y'all

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
And we had a relatively full room

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
A few MTC's but not a lot

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
And had a great time

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
And I was telling jokes, people were laughing

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
We were having fun with it

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
And yes that panel should be up soon

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
Koopa Club is going to put it on their feed

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
So I'll let y'all know when it's up

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
And because it was the last panel scheduled for that room

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
We got, or you guys rather, got to run long

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
So that was good

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
Yeah that was good

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
And we had a great time

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
That was really the highlight for me

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
Getting to do what I love to do

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
You know, I want to go next year

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
Oh yeah

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
Because I was actually trying to think of

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
Next year is my 20 year high school reunion

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
Oh my gosh

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
Shoot me in the face already

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
But I want to do one con next year

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
Assuming I don't move to Washington

20:04.000 --> 20:08.000
So I was actually thinking of making that my con next year

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
Although I have another friend

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
That's definitely trying to get me back to Fonamy

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
For Homestuck cosplay

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
Oh geez

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
You know what, I wasn't gonna do it at all

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
Until she's like, we need to do this

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
And it's better when you have two people

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
I was like, fine, I'll make a costume

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
I was actually gonna suggest GamerX look into the

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
San Jose Convention Center, I mean yes

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
I know that's not the heart of San Francisco

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
But San Jose is still the Bay Area

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
It's easy to get to

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
They need to check the one that YowieCon is at

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
Which is right outside Burlingame

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
Where I

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
Right by the airport, right?

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
Yeah, and it was a really good venue for the convention

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
YowieCon is still relatively small

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
And it was perfectly accommodating

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
To everything, especially having

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
Electronic glass toys in

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
The dealer's room

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
And then they had JunkieSpot there

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
So I think that, you know, they need to

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
Did they have a dealer's room?

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
Yes, it was small, like everything for first year con

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
It was very small, and some tables

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
I'd like to talk to the organizer actually

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
He's a pretty approachable guy

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
So if you can give me that information

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
Wink wink, nudge nudge

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
Yeah, I'd definitely be going next year

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
I had a good time

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
Yeah, we didn't do Sunday

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
Because we ended up taking a bunch of people

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
Up to our friend's place above the Castro

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
And drinking until 3 AM

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
And we got trashed

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
That was the best thing we did

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
But it was just great to have everybody in one place

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
It's like, who drank all this tequila?

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
You did, it's 3 AM

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
Oh shit, so yeah

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
Jonko from Koopa Club and I were doing shots of Fireball

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
And you guys know how I am after one drink

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
I think I had like four shots of Fireball

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
But being in an enclosed space with all those people

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
Plus the alcohol lowering your immune system

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
Con crud

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
Yeah, and exhaustion

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
Don't forget that, that's a big one after Clue two weeks ago

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
Con crud hit Rob hard

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
I have been sick since

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
Somehow I didn't really come down with it

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
Until Tuesday

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
I was really sick, I'm still getting over it

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
Like you might be able to hear it in my voice

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
Yeah, I've been sick since Tuesday

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
If you listen to Hoard House on Wednesday

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
I'm really out of it

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
Yeah, I'm still trying to recover from that

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
Not fun, but I better not get that

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
When I go to Dragon Con

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
You remember my advice

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
And do not drink soda at a con

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
Drink nothing but tea

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
SSJ 100 Matt in our chat room says

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
On a scale of one to grandpa, how drunk was everyone?

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
Every single person

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
Was drinking except for

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
Xtaphir, I believe

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
From what you're describing, on a scale of one to grandpa

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
You were on girl

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
The slag kick was driving

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
So he didn't drink anything

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
Oh yeah, that's right, he didn't drink either

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
And Brad from Pod Culture in our chat room

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
At live.vognetwork.com is saying

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
Yay, Fireball, and more Fireball is coming to Dragon Con

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
Here we go

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
There is something I'm making, Rob, that you should try

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
If you like the Fireball

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
I'm making ginger rum

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
With actual ginger and actual cinnamon

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
I wish it could come to Dragon Con

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
Well, you know what, if someone's got money

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
I actually do have places to stay

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
If you are

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
If you are going to be in Atlanta

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
Join us at Dragon Con

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
I don't know if we have the final details on the panel yet

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
But I'm sure Bobby will be spreading that all over the internet

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
As soon as we know

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
I think it's tentatively Sunday night

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
Around the time that OLR would usually be

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
Which does mean we are not going to have a show again

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
Labor Day weekend

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
I apologize because that's two shows in about a month's span

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
That we're going to be missing

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
Enough, got to do it

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
So, it's Labor Day weekend

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
I think a lot of you guys will be doing various things

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
Conventions of your own and so forth

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
Any last words on GamerX, Alan, before we get into our gaming weeks?

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
Nothing, that was it

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
Okay, Loki, do you have something to say?

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
Labor Day weekend, Saints Row IV

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
All day and all night

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
Alright, let's talk about our gaming weeks

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
The types of video games that you've been playing this week

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
I actually think we'll let Alan start tonight, our guest

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
Alan, how's your gaming week?

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
So we're going to spend an hour on this segment

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
I've been playing everything

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
Speed it up

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
Really quickly, back in March and April

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
I was trying to play Dead Space 1

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
Because of the hype around Dead Space 3

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
It was too scary, I chickened out, I haven't touched it since then

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
Necromorphs are terrifying

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
And it's claustrophobic and it was very scary

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
I also played and beat GTA IV

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
The main game with Niko

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
Twice, I beat it

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
And then I ran through and beat it again

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
I haven't done the expansions yet

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
More recently, because of the Steam Trading Card stuff

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
I've played

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
McPixel

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
McPixel's awesome

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
I burnt out on it kind of fast

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
Because I was trying to get 100% on everything

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
Where you have to find all the jokes

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
All of the things that you can click wrong

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
Basically, there's a bomb

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
It's just one screen, one room

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
There's a bomb somewhere

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
You have 20 seconds to click stuff to figure out how to defuse the bomb

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
It's kind of like WarioWare

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
It's very quick-paced

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
Once you fail, you move on to the next one

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
And it's just trial and error

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
So yeah, that was a lot of fun

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
It's really neat

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
I got 100% on the first couple stages

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
And then burnt out on it

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
I played

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
Revenge of the Titans

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
Which is a tower defense game

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
Which I played for the Steam Trading Cards

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
I don't like tower defense

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
So once I saw that's what it was

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
I was like, okay, I'm not playing this

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
Past the hour and a half it's going to take me to get

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
My little Steam goodies

25:25.000 --> 25:29.000
The longest time I've ever played a tower defense game

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
Is Plants vs. Zombies

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
Which is a great game, but I just don't care

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
It's kind of like Bobby with first person shooters

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
I understand the strategy behind them

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
I just don't care

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
And then the game that I really want to talk about

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
Is Hotline Miami

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
Which is phenomenal and I'm really kind of irritated

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
That I haven't played it since

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
It came out in October and I'm just now discovering it

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
I got it, I haven't played it yet

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
It's sitting in my library

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
And I don't have it installed

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
Oh, I do have it installed, sweet

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
But I haven't played it

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
The music is phenomenal

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
The creators of the game were inspired by that movie

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
Drive with Ryan Gosling

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
Awesome

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
Which is kind of like a noir, neon

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
New 80s feel to it

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
And I think they even thank the director of that movie

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
In the credits

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
It's ultra violent

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
I'm not too great about it

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
Aside from the flawless soundtrack

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
Drive was scored by Kravinsky

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
Who is this French electro producer

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
They have a bunch of similar artists

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
Doing the soundtrack

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
With a completely Polish name

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
So yeah, the soundtrack

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
Look it up on YouTube, it's phenomenal

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
I think we're going to play two of the songs

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
From Hotline Miami during the break

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
Yes, but that would only be for the live listeners

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
Also to say though, if people do want to see

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
The game in action, Classic Game Room reviewed it

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
Not too long ago

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
And he does a really good review

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
It shows plenty of the gameplay

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
If I have time tonight, maybe I should do some live stream

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
Because I haven't played it yet at all

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
So that might be a fun one

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
It's a fast game

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
It's also very hard

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
It took me a while to figure out the learning curve

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
What the hell you're supposed to do

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
What's in chat

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
I'm laughing because Fifth Dream in our chatroom

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
says, oh look, I have Hotline Miami in Steam

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
Who knew?

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
I've done that

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
If you bought Humble Bundle 8, you got it

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
And one great thing about it

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
It is ultra-violent

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
But even just the title screen

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
And the music that plays

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
There is something disturbing

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
And really eerie about that game

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
That they nailed

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
There's a part halfway through the game

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
Where the player character starts to hallucinate

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
And you start seeing dead people at the 7-Eleven

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
Or in his apartment that aren't really there

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
There's a song that plays in your apartment

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
At the start of each mission

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
I'm uncomfortable playing this

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
And it's not because of the violence

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
Which does get a little out of control at times

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
But the creators for such a

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
It looks like a Super NES game

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
Basically

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
Really captured

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
It's a very unsettling game

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
And it's really amazing in that sense

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
And I think that's

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
I played some Team Fortress 2

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
With the gang

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
And no Mass Effect 2 or 3

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
I kind of burn out on that

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
Not for good

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
But I have my third and fourth Shepherd

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
And I'm like, I'll finish their careers later

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
Torchlight 2, I've been playing a lot of that

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
You enjoying Torchlight 2?

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
I've hit a plateau

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
Where I'm on an overworld map

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
That I keep dying on

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
Like I just get steamrolled

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
Because I'm playing it on veteran

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
Which is kind of like the hard mode

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
Not elite or super insane

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
I was doing fine, I kept quaffing my health potions

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
I was keeping up, but this one map

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
Trying to get to the other side of it

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
Where the quest marker is, I just get destroyed

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
So I need to

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
There's no way to grind really, because monsters don't respawn

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
I'm going to have to do some co-op sometime

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
It'll be fun

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
Alright, well if that's it for your gaming week

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
Totally not playing Animal Crossing

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
Right this second, right?

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
Screw that game, no I'm kidding

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
I'm totally playing Animal Crossing right now

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
Yeah, Misty's in there, Deft is in there

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
We did have Fifth Dream earlier

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
I don't know if Fifth Dream returned

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
Look out for Misty, she'll hit you with a bug now

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
When you're not looking

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
Well I told everyone they can have my pears

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
It just saved me some perfect pears

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
But yeah, playing Animal Crossing

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
You know

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
I am actually back to Mass Effect 3

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
Because I am taking my modding practice

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
Another step further

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
Someone put out a hair mod

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
Where you can use Brooks' hair

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
Instead of Allers, which actually makes Allers look decent

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
But

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
There's another

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
Hair mesh out there

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
That I actually finally got

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
To replace the standard Chacwas hair with this one

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
But I can't get it to run without

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
Crashing my game because I need to get the

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
Right texture for the hair working

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
Even though I think the cute texture would actually

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
Work just fine with it, but I'm thinking out loud

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
So yeah, I'm still playing with it

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
But I finally figured out how to do mesh replacements

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
So that's one thing

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
I am

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
I'm actually

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
Going to probably start livestreaming again

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
My playthrough of Mass Effect 3

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
Just so I can

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
Finish

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
The missions I was on

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
Because I'm like halfway through the game right now

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
And a couple people asked me, so I might do it

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
I also

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
Am playing Borderlands 2

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
With Dan

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
Because Dan's like, you're going to like it, it's going to be fun

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
You won't get that sick

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
I had a headache by the time I was done

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
But I wasn't like frighteningly

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
Nauseous like I usually am with

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
FPS's

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
Which yeah, for any new listener, just because we

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
Get new listeners every few weeks or so

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
You

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
Well, you get sick from

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
Playing first person shooters because of the motion

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
Stuff right? I honestly think that the sickness

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
I was getting was

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
With low res

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
Polygon

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
Because the game that's always done it to me worst

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
Was Goldeneye on

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
The Nintendo 64

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
And the early 3D

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
First person shooters

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
I've noticed that I'll get a little sick with like

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
With Portal 2 for a while

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
And then I was fine

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
And I'm having the same adjustment curve with

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
Borderlands 2 so I think I might be

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
Getting over some of that

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
I still can't use my

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
3DS and I think they

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
No, someone just left

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
I still can't play the 3D mode on my 3DS

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
I'm trying to catch a bug

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
Or something so I can gauge the distance

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
But

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
I'm

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
Also playing

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
Back to

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
Playing some Drunken Robot

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
Pornography which is awesome

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
That's the Jumping Flash

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
The Jumping Flash with guns

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
And dying really quickly that's

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
Really freaking hard game, yeah that game's awesome

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
And

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
I

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
Oh no wonder that was Act F that

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
Left to go get cherries to sell at my retail

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
Stay focused girl

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
And also thank you for loaning

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
Me Kid Icarus because I've really wanted

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
To try it, yeah no worries just watch the hand cramping

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
It's a little crazy

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
Try to put it on a flat surface to play

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
If you can

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
Well going actually back to that I'm actually

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
Thinking about

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
Starting Bayonetta

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
That's a fun game, yeah I loved

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
It and I didn't get too far in it but

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
Since I've started drawing again

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
I haven't had the problem as

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
Quickly with my hand cramping I mean it still

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
Does it like especially if I

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
It actually does it more if I'm writing

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
Than if I'm drawing

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
So but I've actually sat down with the controller

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
I started Final Fantasy 7

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
Which is almost impossible to play with the damn keyboard

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
So I'm probably gonna be

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
I use a 360 controller

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
Yeah we've got that and Dan's

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
Been playing

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
A lot of really

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
Weird Nintendo knockoffs

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
On a Sega Genesis emulator

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
It's been hilarious

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
And he actually just went through

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
The Ballad of Gay Tony again

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
Which is really really good for

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
GTA I actually really like the story

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
So

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
Between the two of us we've actually

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
Had a pretty bustling gaming

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
Week, despite being

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
You know working full time and then

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
Finding out hoops they don't like

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
When you're open minded

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
Anything else for your gaming week?

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
Ummm

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
I know there's

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
Another game but I can't think of it off the top of my head

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
Alright we'll jump in later we'll come back to you

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
Loki how about you?

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
See I played a bit

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
Of Team Fortress 2 this week

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
And

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
What else oh Saints Row the 3rd

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
I went through I was just trying to finish up some more

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
Achievements on the Steam version

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
And I went ahead and

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
Finished off all the

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
Vehicle

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
What was it

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
The car theft stuff

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
Saints book vehicle stuff

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
Where you have to go collect all the vehicles

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
And hijack them and stuff

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
So I did all that and now I have to finish up

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
Like some of the other stuff in the Saints book stuff

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
One of which is

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
The achievement of playing

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
With both sexes so I have

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
Now a female character that I created

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
Just to get that achievement

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
Because I've been playing mostly my male character

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
And so I need to get

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
Two hours out of the way on that

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
To get the achievement and then

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
Ummm

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
Mostly just trying to get

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
Some of the other stuff that

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
I've missed there

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
What else did I play

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
I tried playing some F-Zero GX in Dolphin

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
Just to see how well that worked

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
I figured because Dolphin's been out for a long time

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
That I should be able to run that game and

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
And Dolphin's an emulator

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
For Wii and GameCube games

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
And it

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
Ran like shit so

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
Oh well

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
Well remember it takes a lot more CPU power to emulate

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
You know

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
That actually reminded me

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
I've been trying to get

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
Planet Harriers working

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
Haven't been able to yet

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
And then what else did I do this week

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
Little bit of Call of Duty

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
Modern Warfare 3 still

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
Just because

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
And ummm

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
I pre-purchased

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
My Saints Row 4 on Steam

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
When's that out? That's out what two weeks?

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
It's out a week from Tuesday

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
Oh wow

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
Have you done the character creator?

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
Not yet

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
Originally on PC I was going to import

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
My character

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
But

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
Because my game is modded

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
It won't let me upload my character to their server

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
Yet they're going to somehow

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
Fix that soon

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
That they're going to allow you to upload your modded characters

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
Just because the problem was they have

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
Slider mods

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
I don't really have that on mine

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
But they have slider mods and stuff

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
And that can really screw up characters

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
If you mod a character and then someone downloads that modded character

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
Without having that stuff done

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
So

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
They don't have that yet but they're going to allow that soon

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
But

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
I was going to import that character

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
So I have one for my Xbox

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
I'm just going to import that into 4

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
Because I didn't really need to mess with it yet

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
But it looked fun

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
And I've been working on my game that I'm making

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
So that's it

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
Good luck with that project

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
I'll try to be quick with my gaming week because I honestly

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
Haven't played a lot of new stuff

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
I've been doing the card collecting thing

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
We're kind of in a lull in gaming right now

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
Before the storm really picks up

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
I'm really pumped for the release of Final Fantasy 14

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
Realm Reborn

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
That open beta starts a week from

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
Friday, or last Friday

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
So it's only days away at this point

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
There's a character creator out for 14 by the way

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
Which is also a benchmark

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
So if you're curious about 14 at all

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
You can download that and check it out

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
It's free of course

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
See how that works and play with the character creator there

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
And see what your character would look like in game

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
And the graphics engine that's really good for that game

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
So

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
I was messing around with that

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
Also Team Fortress 2

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
Visiting some older stuff in Steam

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
There's a question I actually played through

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
Probably further than I did on 360 when it first came out

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
It's a great little game

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
And it looks better on the PC than it did on 360

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
I played that for about 20-30 minutes

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
It was like okay this is neat

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
And then I alt tabbed it and went AFK

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
It's fun, I like that, it's a good game

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
And then I've also still been playing the MOBAs

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
I can't remember if I talked about this on the last show

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
I think I did a little bit

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
But I started getting into League of Legends

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
And Dota 2, kind of both of them

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
I don't know, there's things I like about Dota 2

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
And there's things I like about League of Legends

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
So I'm kind of juggling them both right now

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
Which when you're trying to learn them is really confusing

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
But there's these Dota 2

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
Championships going on right now

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
Which you can actually watch, but what I like about it

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
Is that it's not necessarily just like this Twitch thing

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
Or something where you're watching a livestream

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
But you can actually watch in the game client

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
Like while the people are playing

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
And I thought that was kind of neat

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
And apparently if you pony up some cash which goes into the pot

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
You can get in-game items as well with that

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
So that's kind of neat

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
Okay, well, and you know

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
Valve is pretty proud of Dota 2

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
I'm pretty sure, so yeah

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
So I've been playing that

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
I've also been playing League of Legends

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
Dota 2 I'm still mostly in the single player

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
Tutorial stuff, like doing the bot matches

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
And all that, but League of Legends

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
I am playing a lot of co-op versus bots

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
I'm not playing player versus player yet

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
Because I feel like I still suck

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
And I have a lot to learn

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
Also, I'm playing League of Legends

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
I'm playing League of Legends

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
I still suck and I have a lot to learn

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
Although the last match I played

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
Last night I think it was

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
Actually boosted my confidence quite a bit

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
Which is funny because we lost

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
A match against beginner bots

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
But I was the only person

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
Out of the five to get any kills

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
And I actually had like a streak going

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
That actually kind of boosted my confidence

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
I was like, alright, I do know what I'm doing

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
Compared to these four other people

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
So how bad could it be going into a

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
Player versus player match

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
So everybody pray for me

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
As I go into that

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
But that's pretty much my gaming week

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
So, we will start to move into news

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
But I do always like to take a minute for housekeeping

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
Again, we will have no show over

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
Labor Day weekend, but that's still a few weeks away

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
Because I will be in Atlanta at Dragon Con

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
Which I hope you will come by

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
And say hi at the VoG panel

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
Which will be Sunday night at Dragon Con

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
If you're there

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
Also, you can friend us on Twitter

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
Twitter.com slash O-L-R and Facebook

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
Twitter.com slash Orange Lounge Radio

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
Be our friend

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
Let's get into the news

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
It's also been a bit of a slow news week

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
But we still got a few things we want to point out

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
That's going on

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
So, Loki, why don't you start us off

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
Alright, so, let's talk a little bit about

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
Amazon and

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
Yet another company getting on the

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
Android game console bandwagon

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
So, Amazon

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
I guess is playing on

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
It's sort of a rumor right now

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
That they're developing a console

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
I'm assuming it's going to support the Amazon

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
Marketplace

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
As far as details beyond that

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
No idea what it's going to be

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
But basically

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
There's still rumors that Google's

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
Developing their own console

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
So

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
I don't know

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
We'll see

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
They're saying that maybe we'll see it

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
Around Black Friday

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
But

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
It's funny, the more and more I hear

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
About other companies coming out with their own consoles

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
And the specs

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
And the features sound better

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
The less and less I like my Ouya

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
Well, and it's also one of those things where it's like

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
Good God, what kind of

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
What did Ouya do?

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
Now I'm worried that everybody wants a piece of that

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
Because the Kickstarter was so successful

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
It's like we're seeing all of these clones

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
And I'm like, surely

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
We see the end of this coming

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
Where all this crap saturates

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
The market, and then none of them do well

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
I don't think it's necessarily that they're going to

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
Saturate the market, it's just going to be

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
It's, I mean, you can

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
Kind of compare that to tablets

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
Oh my God, there's so many tablets out there that

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
Saturate the market, and none of them are going to do well

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
You know, I think that's what's going to end up happening

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
When you get all these individual marketplaces

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
Because you have

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
Ouya, which is on its own

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
Marketplace, and Amazon, which is its own

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
Marketplace

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
And the Mad Catz one though

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
Is on just a regular

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
Google Play Marketplace

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
So that might be okay

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
I would assume that the Google one

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
Would be on the Google Play Marketplace

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
So it's just when you start

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
Segmenting the Marketplace like that

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
That's when you run into problems

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
I mean, it's great for indie developers

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
That want to, I guess, get their game out

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
Because now they can put it on all these

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
Marketplaces because, I mean, porting your game

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
From Android to

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
The Amazon Marketplace

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
Basically just putting it on the Marketplace

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
Because they're pretty much the same

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
And then also spec wise

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
Some of these newer consoles

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
Are going to be a lot better spec wise

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
Than the Ouya

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
The Ouya may have done

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
Okay as far as Kickstarter goes

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
But the way they've been handling everything

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
Oh, Game Stick was the other one

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
That's another Marketplace, it's its own thing

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
And then there was the other one that was streaming

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
Games, I don't know

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
There's a ton of different options out there

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
And at the end of the day

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
They're all kind of offering similar things

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
There's not a lot of exclusive stuff

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
That differentiates one from the next

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
And

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
The experience isn't all that great

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
At least for the Ouya right now

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
Because that's the only one that's actually to market

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
So far

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
I don't know

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
I think this question is a bit of an ahh

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
But other people are asking it

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
So I'll ask it too

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
Do Sony and Nintendo have anything to be worried about

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
With these consoles, why?

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
Yeah, no

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
I don't think they have anything to be worried about right now

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
But the way things are going right now

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
Is everything kind of trending towards

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
People being, especially a lot of these companies

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
Being interested in indie

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
Developers

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
And

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
Definitely trying to

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
Get indie developers on their platform

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
Because that seems to be where a lot of the interest

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
And innovation is nowadays

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
And so you have these indie platforms

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
Out there like the Ouya

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
It may not be a very powerful platform

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
But it's an independent platform

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
So far, I mean it's still closed

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
But you gotta have some sort of

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
Restrictions in place so there's not rampant piracy

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
Because as far as I'm aware right now

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
I don't think you can really pirate Ouya games

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
Although I haven't rooted my Ouya yet

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
Soon

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
So I don't really know how it really

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
Treats that, but

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
I think that's kind of been the draw

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
Is there's all these indie games

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
I think that if a company like

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
Amazon or even Mad Cats

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
Or Google come out

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
With their own, well we know

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
Mad Cats is, but if they come out with their own

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
Device, I think it's going to be

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
A better piece of hardware

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
And as far as the customer service

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
And the way everything's handled is going to be a better

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
Device anyways because they have experience

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
With developing

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
Things and actually being able to market it

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
And have the platform, they're much bigger

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
Than a start up company like Ouya

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
Or PlayStick for example

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
So I think it's promising

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
But I'd have to see what their specs are going to be

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
I mean hell, Amazon

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
Making a console wouldn't be that

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
Crazy considering they have their own

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
Tablets so

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
Why not? I can see that happening

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
Alright

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
Well, we'll see if there's any truth to this

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
I think the one thing too I want to throw out there

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
Is that it would be interesting with Amazon because

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
They do have all the things that are tied to Amazon Prime

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
Such as, you know, their version of Netflix

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
Which, you know, big deal

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
All those boxes will play the streaming

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
Video things, but it could be interesting as well

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
What kind of like special things they might

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
Offer that would be exclusive to their

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
Console, you know, keep in mind they have

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
The Kindle stuff too, they have

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
The movie marketplace

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
Where you can buy things, it would be interesting

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
To see if there might be any synergy

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
There. But the price even

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
Of their tablets is coming down so much that

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
Like, I would think it'd be

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
In their best interest not necessarily to

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
Come out with a console but to maybe come out with

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
Something that you can play your

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
Games on your tablet and then

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
You can stream them to your TV

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
You know, even almost like that Google

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
The Chromecast thing

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
Or, you know, and have a controller

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
And stuff so then that way you can take it

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
On the go and you can play with it at

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
Home and stuff. How I really wish

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
The, you know, Wii U was kind of handled where you

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
Could, you know, that'd be awesome to have your games

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
Loaded on like a compact

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
Not a compact flash but like, you know, some sort of

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
You know, flash memory

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
Or something like that and then that way

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
You can play them on the go instead of having

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
It stream from your console, of course, you know

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
It's not gonna work hardware wise but

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
It would still be kinda cool if you could

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
Do that as easily and I know that was

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
Something that they wanted to do with like the Vita

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
Even where, you know, you play your

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
Vita version of MLB

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
Or you play your PS3 version of

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
MLB and then you flip it over to

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
The, you know, Vita and you take it on

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
On the road and that kind of stuff. I think

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
That would be really cool but

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
I don't know, we'll have to see. I mean right now it's just

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
A rumor and I mean hell

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
Apple, I mean that's been

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
A rumor for the longest time that Apple's gonna do something

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
With Apple TV or something that turned that into

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
A console so

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
I don't know, I don't, it's

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
All these different options though

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
That are not necessarily

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
Like the major console manufacturers

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
Are good options I think for indies

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
So, and even now, even with

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
The way they're kind of, you know

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
Opening it up a little bit for indies

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
Especially like the Xbox One and the PlayStation

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
4 and stuff, it's just

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
It's a good time to be indie I guess

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
Alright, well let's

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
Move on to some more news

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
This company isn't necessarily indie

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
But people sure love their games and

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
To the point where people will go

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
To great lengths to figure out where the

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
Heck this company might be going and

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
It's Valve and it's about

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
An upcoming project that's been spotted

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
Left 4 Dead 3

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
Now this is a little more than

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
You know, well since they did 1 and 2

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
A 3's gotta happen at some point, but here's what happened

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
Apparently a Valve

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
Studio tour was given

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
To some folks who actually

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
Got a snapshot of somebody's

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
Computer that actually had references

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
To, well it's like a change log

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
Of everything that's been going on

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
It had references to Source 2

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
Which we know has been a thing, Valve's openly said

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
They're working on Source

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
Pretty surprised, but L4D3

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
Was also there

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
So, you know, it's something

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
That's happening, could that be the first

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
Game to use Source 2

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
Who knows, and not

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
Unfortunately Half-Life 3, I don't know

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
But apparently

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
More thoughts come out after it

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
That say, hey, this is actually something that

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
Is happening, so

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
Alan, I'm sure

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
You've been following this a bit, what do you think?

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
Well the Source engine, which was

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
Designed and made for Half-Life 2 originally

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
Which is 2003-2004

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
Anything that Valve

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
Has put out that's not Dota

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
Is on Source, Team Fortress 2

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
Portal, Half-Life 2

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
Episode 2, it's all the modified

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
Original Source engine

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
If Source 2 is done

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
To the point where they can release L4D3

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
On it, even if it takes another 3 years

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
If that, like, this is the product

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
This is the Source 2 engine running, that means

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
Half-Life 3, they have

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
An API that they're going to build the game on top of

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
So now, announce it

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
Or should you just give up hope?

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
Mark Laidlaw, who I

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
Tweeted with a couple weeks ago

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
He posted a vine of him in an elevator

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
And he was kind of hovering his finger

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
Over the 3 button

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
Hovering, then the last second he pushes L

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
For lobby, like he won't push 3

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
And I was like, ugh, like a dagger in my heart

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
Wasn't there something else too, where it was like

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
He said something about playing Pikmin 3 and you tweeted him

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
Like, what's it like?

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
Yeah, he was like, Pikmin 3 is really good

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
And I was like, so Mark, what's it like to play a sequel

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
With a 3 in it, what's that like?

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
And he favorited it and then said

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
Oh, we're all slaves to Nintendo

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
Valve hearts Nintendo confirmed

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
Yeah

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
I love Twitter for things like that

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
That's why Twitter rules

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
I do find it funny that people are looking forward

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
To L4D3 considering that there was a

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
Boycott campaign for L4D2

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
If you remember that

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
Oh, right, because it came out so soon after the first one

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
Its street date was almost a year after

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
L4D1

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
But that was, of course, 3, 4, 5 years ago

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
So now 3 has had enough time to

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
Simmer

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
Tigerkaw in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
What if Valve is like Half-Life 3

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
Exclusive on Xbox One and PlayStation 4

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
Since both consoles have PC hardware

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
Gabe would never let that happen

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
Gabe would have to be pushed down a flight of stairs

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
Portal 2 was on PlayStation 3

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
Well, I guess it was on Xbox too, but it was way better on PlayStation 3

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
With the Steam integration and all that

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
It was way better on Steam

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
That's true

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
I would also think too, honestly, if Steam's got this

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
Steam bot, and I said this on the show before

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
I said if they want to sell a million of those

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
Steam boxes, make Half-Life 3

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
A timed exclusive to those Steam boxes

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
And watch that shit sell

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
I mean, that's all they'd have to do

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
Right?

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
Alright, anyhow, let's move on, more news

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
DarkSakura

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
You know how we all complain about GameStop

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
The evil G

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
As we have been calling it

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
Basically, the federal judge

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
In Camden, New Jersey said

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
Uh, yeah, you can sue them, go for it

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
Basically saying that

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
The games that were being sold

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
There did not fully

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
Advertise

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
That there might be other costs

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
Involved, like for online passes

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
Which, honestly

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
I think the lawsuit

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
Is a little bit on the frivolous side

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
Because it is common sense

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
However, to quote a

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
Deadpool meme

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
Common sense, so rare it's a super power

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
Yeah

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
So, because these people lack common sense

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
And other people agree

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
That they shouldn't have to have common sense

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
GameStop is being sued

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
Well, I mean, if someone's grandma

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
Wants to get, you know, 8 year old Timmy

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
Modern Warfare 3

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
And she's trying to get herself a deal

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
And buys it

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
And she gives it to him

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
Thinking that it's new

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
Or he thinks it's new and it's used and now he can't play online

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
She didn't know, there wasn't a sticker on it

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
Right, so

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
It's for people buying games that don't play games

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
But it's still though

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
It's technically

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
I mean, this is a decision for the publishers

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
Technically the game is complete

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
You can play the game

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
And sometimes even a portion of the multiplayer

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
But, you know, it's additional DLC

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
That you need to purchase

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
You know

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
I mean, even though it's kind of sad

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
Is when they did this lawsuit

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
That now it's already fixed

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
The problem is already gone

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
So, I don't think

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
That they should be

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
I don't think it's GameStop's decision

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
I don't think they should have to be

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
Responsible for something the publisher does

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
Which is ironic

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
Because EA has now said

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
That they're doing away with online pass

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
It's very attractive too

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
So any of those games that you buy

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
They're gone

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
But unfortunately it doesn't really change

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
In the world of a lawsuit

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
Because there was a window of time when it was the case

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
I want to say, if I remember correctly

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
I think these are the same guys that were suing

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
Subway and actually won

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
For the footlongs

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
Did they win? I thought that hadn't been decided yet

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
Oh, okay, I wasn't sure

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
But for the footlongs being 11 inches

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
Which, come on

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
The foot is fucking 12 inches

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
That also raises the red flag

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
A little bit, though

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
Okay, now we're talking about a serial lawsuit

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
Type of individual

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
You always kind of have to raise your eyebrow

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
With that, like, potentially

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
Abusing the system

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
I

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
I think that it's something

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
That, yeah, it's good to have on your label

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
But, in the end

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
And

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
I think

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
People are looking for excuses

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
To sue

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
The moment somebody is the slightest

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
Bit put off

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
That the first thought

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
Is sue

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
And I think that

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
It would have

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
Been better

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
Better handled by sending a

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
Letter of complaint to the company

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
I don't know if they did that

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
I haven't seen anything about that in the article

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
But, um

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
But they should have

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
Instead of, you know, just suing the company

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
The right step would have been

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
Contacting the company and say

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
Hey, this wasn't on the label

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
We weren't aware of this

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
What can you do? If they don't

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
Respond, then the next logical

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
Step would be

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
Better business bureau

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
Then the next logical step

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
May be a lawsuit if they are that

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
Pleased, but in the end

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
I

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
I really think jumping right to that

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
Conclusion is frivolous

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
You know, it is also stupid too because

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
Even says right here, it's one of the guys

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
Bought, you know, Need for Speed

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
Hot Pursuit

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
And, um

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
He tried to play it online and then it says

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
He was hit with an extra fee of $15

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
No, he was told to purchase DLC

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
It was $15. At that point, if he doesn't like that

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
He should have returned it back to the store

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
Which he could do within seven days

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
I don't understand

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
That might be GameStop's way out of this too

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
I don't understand, you know, why

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
And no one was forcing him to do that

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
You know, if anything

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
If you want to get into it, if anything

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
I think people should be suing fucking EA

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
For having to pay those online passes

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
And then them shutting the servers down

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
That would be a little bit more

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
Worth merit

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
I mean, even now, it's just kind of like

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
Okay, well, they're done with that

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
But I don't think GameStop's really

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
Should be the blame of that stuff

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
You're buying a used copy

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
A used copy is not the same as a new copy

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
It's gonna, you know

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
Anything that you buy used is not gonna be

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
Of the same quality as a new thing

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
So, I think this is gonna be thrown out

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
I think that they're gonna

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
They're not gonna win it

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
I actually think they're gonna win

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
We'll see

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
Didn't we kind of predict that this might happen

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
When we first heard about the online pass

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
That the consumers would not be educated on it

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
And that this kind of thing would happen

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
I'm almost positive it had to be said

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
I mean, there's two phrases

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
That are gonna be going out of

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
I think common parlance, you know, soon

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
One of them is, you know

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
The buyer beware

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
And the other one's going to be shoppers remorse

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
Or buyers remorse

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
Because you can just sue now if you're remorseful over your purchase

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
Dungeonbuster in our chatroom says

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
There are people that still have trouble interpreting

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
ESRB ratings

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
That's true, maybe the consumer's not gonna learn this stuff anytime soon

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
That's why they need to rate them like they do movies

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
Yeah, I agree with that

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
I only think the ESRB is so

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
Confusing because it seems pretty

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
It says what an E for everyone

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
I don't understand how that's confusing

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
It's not to you and me

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
At what point though, I mean

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
I was actually dealing with my library

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
Accounts and stuff and we're talking about Final Fantasy

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
XIV, you know

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
They're ordering it thinking it's a game

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
That they can rent out or loan out to

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
Their customers even though

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
On our internal website

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
That they order off of, there's a big

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
Fucking banner

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
It's bold and there's

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
Yellow behind it that says

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
Will not work

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
MMO, cost money to play

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
Not recommended for

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
Renting out

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
People are stupid and they see Final Fantasy

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
I didn't know

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
What more can you fucking do

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
To tell these people

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
Or inform them

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
Even the ESRB, they tweak their shit

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
So that it would be more clear

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
There's nothing you can do

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
To get it through these people

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
Parents and stuff, they just don't give a shit

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
No amount of changing your logos

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
Sometimes parents just don't understand

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
Sometimes just parents don't give a shit

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
Or consumers don't give a shit

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
And they're whatever

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
They're not gonna learn

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
What it is

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
I hate to say it, my mother is a prime example of this

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
And actually there are

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
Psychological studies going behind this

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
People get comfortable with a certain idea

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
And anything that

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
Supports their idea, even if it is

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
Wrong, gives them

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
Basically a happy

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
Chemical response

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
That's why there's a lot of stupid Republicans out there

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
Wow

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
Well that's why Rush Limbaugh exists then

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
But it goes either way

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
The moment that something

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
Is said that's

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
Contrary to this idea

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
That is imprinted into their minds

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
It of course forms an opposite

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
Response, the first instinct

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
Is not to listen to it, is to dismiss it

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
Even if it might save them

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
Money in the long run, and then when they go back

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
To suffer the consequences of it

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
Of course, oh well nobody told me that's because

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
You have a selective fucking memory

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
Alright

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
Um

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
I wanted to go to another comment in our chatroom at

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
Live.vognetwork.com from ShadowNextGen

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
Who says, there was some good GameStop news

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
This week too

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
I'm assuming that's the reprinting of Xenoblade

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
Right? Oh yeah

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
That came across my Twitter, that has to be it

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
Yeah that has to be the good GameStop news

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
Someone, and I'm sorry if you're in chat and I just blanked on who it was

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
But someone on my Twitter feed posted

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
Xenoblade Chronicles

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
Used

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
And it was 80 bucks

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
Used from GameStop and if they're reprinting

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
It they have to redo that used

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
I had no idea that the printing was that limited

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
And it should just be GameStop exclusive

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
It's weird that they're reprinting it too

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
When the Wii isn't really being pushed right now

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
It's supposed to be all about the Wii U

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
You can play it in the Wii U though right?

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
Well of course you can, but I wonder if the prices drop

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
Maybe it's like $20 at this point

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
It would make a really good

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
Thing to have on Wii U

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
Please

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
Them dropping the price of something that's going

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
For $90 right now

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
And it's exclusive to them, yeah I'm sure

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
They're totally motivated from competition

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
To drop that price

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
Like hell they are

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
It's probably going to come back at 60 bucks

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
Alright let's move on with some more news

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
Loki

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
Alright so there was a couple

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
Bits of information from

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
Microsoft this week about

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
Things

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
Including Xbox Live family packs

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
They are going away

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
Obviously since we already knew that

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
And they're going to be converted into individual

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
Gold accounts on August

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
27th

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
That's probably around the same time

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
The new dashboard update is going to come out

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
And we're going to have some other things tied in with that

59:32.000 --> 59:36.000
One of the reasons why they're doing this

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
Is because the

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
Xbox One

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
For example is going to allow you to share

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
Your gold membership, sort of

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
Basically the way they're going to do it

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
Is you have

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
Your console

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
Only one person or one

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
Live account on that console

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
Needs to have live gold

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
So say I have my family

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
And each one of them has an Xbox Live account

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
I only need to have gold

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
For everybody to play online

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
Regardless of which account is signed in

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
And then also the same thing

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
Like if I go to my friend's house

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
And sign into my account

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
They can also play on Xbox Live with me

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
While I'm over there

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
Then they came out and started talking about

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
This digital game sharing thing

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
Which made people think, oh my god they brought back

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
The digital game thing that they were talking about

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
Before and it was so fucking awesome

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
Which we never saw and we had no idea what it really was

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
So first off

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
They came out and they

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
Phrased it kind of like that, hey we're bringing

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
The digital game sharing thing back

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
You're going to be able to do that

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
The problem is, it isn't fucking new

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
This is the same shit that you can do right now

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
On the Xbox 360

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
It's basically, I buy a game online

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
For example, say I bought

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
I don't know, an Xbox Live arcade game

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
Say I bought a

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
Super Street Fighter 2 or something like that

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
And I have it on my console

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
I've downloaded it

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
It's good to go, I can play it

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
Anybody that's in my family

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
Or anybody else, any other account on

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
My console can play that as well

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
If I go over to Rob's

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
And download the game

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
Sign into my account

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
And download the game on his console

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
We can play it

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
Full version, as long as I'm signed in

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
But as soon as I leave, it's going to revert back

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
To the demo version

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
It's exactly the same fucking shit that happens right now

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
And they fucking marketed it as some brand new

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
Fucking thing, and guess what

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
A bunch of the fucking unwashed masses

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
Xbox fanboys or whatever

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
Holy shit

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
Game set match, fucking takeover

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
You're so fucking stupid

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
You don't even realize

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
How stupid you are

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
To be fair

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
Cool, this game sharing thing

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
It's the same shit you have now

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
And you're like, oh my god

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
I'm going to buy an Xbox One now because it's so amazing

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
You're so stupid

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
And that's why they're going to be able to sell those consoles

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
Because you're so fucking stupid

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
You're so fucking stupid

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
And I love it because I was complaining about that shit on Twitter

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
And some random fucking idiot that works on a

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
Microsoft store is like, no that's not how it was

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
This is brand new information

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
I'm like, you're a fucking idiot

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
You sell this shit and you don't even fucking know what you're talking about

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
You dumbass

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
Alright?

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
Except I said that in my head

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
I'm not going to waste my time doing that

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
He was all red in the face just going, okay

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
You couldn't fit it in 140 paces

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
Oh, I showed so much restraint

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
I was going to film a YouTube video and all that shit

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
I was going to like, oh hey

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
What the hell, it's black magic

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
My 360 turned into an Xbox One

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
To be fair

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
Just to play devil's advocate a little bit to your rant

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
Loki

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
One of the things that Xbox One is offering

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
That Xbox 360 didn't offer is the whole game streaming

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
Where you can start playing the game right away

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
Without the mega long installation

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
So, I mean, doesn't that kind of

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
Yes, while this isn't a new thing

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
Doesn't it really enhance

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
Because it wouldn't be practical

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
For me to like, say, bring Mass Effect over to your house

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
And we have to

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
Or, excuse me, go over to your house

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
To install my digital copy of Mass Effect

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
Or whatever and wait for it to download 7 gigs

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
Before we play it

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
Because Xbox One will be able to play it right away

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
So that does kind of enhance it a little bit

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
Right?

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
Well, yeah, because it would have just been ridiculous

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
If you had to do that

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
As it is, I mean, I know

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
Hopefully they're going to treat the recovering profiles

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
A lot easier because

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
Now you have to download your profile

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
And it takes a while

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
And then you'd have to download the game

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
And all that stuff

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
It's just kind of ridiculous

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
Of course, I mean, they're going to try to market it

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
And how amazing this is

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
Of course they're going to do that

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
Because they want to make themselves look good

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
So, why not?

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
ActDeaf in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
It's been a while since we've had a Loki rage that hard

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
And TigerClaw says

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
Loki ranting and shouting at the Microsoft employee

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
Probably would have been like that video of the lady

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
Shouting at an Apple store

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
I seriously thought about doing that

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
But just to prove myself right

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
It's not worth it

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
On someone like that that's randomly going through

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
And commenting on everybody's story

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
And I went and read through his stuff

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
And I'm like, nah, it's not even worth it

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
He's drank so much of the Microsoft Kool-Aid

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
That there's no getting through this guy

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
I'm not even going to waste my time

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
Do you really think the Xbox One is going to be that bad though?

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
Because I kind of think they've gone back

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
On everything they need to

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
The only thing that makes the Xbox One

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
At this point is the fact that it's $100 more

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
And has that required Kinect

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
But it's kind of one of those things where it's like

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
Inevitably, a year and a half after it launches

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
There will be some type of price drop

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
I will get an Xbox One eventually

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
I'm not saying that the Xbox One is bad

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
I'm just calling out bullshit marketing

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
That's all I'm calling out

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
If Sony did the exact same thing

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
If Sony came out and said

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
Hey, let's talk about how awesome

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
Cloud sharing is

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
This is a brand new feature that we're bringing to the PlayStation 4

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
It's never been done before

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
I'd call them out and be like, fuck you

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
This has been something that's been available already

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
Something like that

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:06.000
Nintendo started talking about something ridiculous

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:12.000
I find it fascinating that they would come out and say that

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
But it makes sense

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
Of course they're going to want to do that

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
And the game sharing thing

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
Yeah, it's cool

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
I can sign into my account and play the games I have bought

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
That's not really sharing

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
That's more like I'm going to a friend's house and watching a movie

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
That I brought with me or something

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
Any comment from Alan or Dark Soccer on this before we move on?

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
I like rants

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
Like I said in chat

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
If they create some sort of

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
Mobile mode or travel mode

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
For your account when you sign in

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
It makes the process faster

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
That'd be nice

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
But like Loki said, it's still the same shit we have now

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
I hate importing my profile

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
To a different Xbox

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
It takes like 10 minutes

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
And you have to do it again

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
When you come back home, you have to reimport your profile

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
That's awful

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
Going forward

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
This is probably going to tie in with Xbox One

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
Live accounts

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
Because you're connecting to their service

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
It's probably just going to exist in the cloud

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
You're just going to be signing in like you would sign in on a website

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
And you're never going to have to download that profile

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
Because it's all on the cloud

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
So that's

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
Probably going to improve

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
You're not going to have that

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
My 10 meg profile

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
For some reason

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
If I'm downloading any other 10 meg file

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
Anywhere

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
It would be like instantaneous

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
But oh no, for some reason

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
I'm operating at 24 4

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
Or 28 8 or whatever

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
Going back to the 90s

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
Let me bandwidth

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
In the interest of time, I'm going to move on

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
I want to talk a little bit about Nintendo

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
Because Nintendo put out one of their Nintendo Directs this week

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
Where they talked about

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
Clarified a few things going on for the rest of the year

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
For the record, I think those are a brilliant idea

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
They're working out really well

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
The great thing is they kind of come out of nowhere

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
People are already saying

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
Get ready, y'all

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
Apple is going to do something on September 10

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
God, that's so far away

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
So far away?

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
It's less than a month

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
That's still a long ways away

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
Compared to Nintendo

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
There's going to be a Nintendo Direct day after tomorrow

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
Get up early and watch it

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
I'm just saying

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
They had the Nintendo Direct

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
There's no real big bombshells

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
But just a few things

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
First off, Sonic Lost World will be coming out October 22

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
They were talking about some kind of functionality

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
Between 3DS and Wii U

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
That sounded interesting

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
Art Academy Sketchpad for Wii U

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
Some details there

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
Kind of looks like you'll be able to post your drawings

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
Into Miiverse

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
Which as Miiverse grows

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
Looks like some people are doing some crazy shit in there too

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
I think there's a version of it already

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
Downloadable

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
A little mini version of it

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
Luigi was confirmed

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
As a new Super Smash Brothers character

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
I was kind of like

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
Isn't that kind of a given?

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
I kind of already thought he was

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
Is he going to have crazy leg jumping?

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
Did he in the other ones?

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
I was thinking

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
They need to announce

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
Mecha Luigi or Demon Deaf Luigi

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
Where he's a super uber one

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
Or Waluigi

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
Waluigi's awesome

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
I have another Nintendo exclusive

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
The next Zelda game is going to have canon in it

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
Oh my god

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
Alright

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
Moving on

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
Some other things announced in the Nintendo Direct

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
Rayman Legends Wii U will have Mario and Luigi costumes

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
Now they're not going to actually be Mario and Luigi

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:38.000
But it's like Rayman wearing the red suspenders and all that

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
I still found it interesting

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
Despite all the drawings

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
I kind of think that's one of those games nowadays

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
For any Nintendo made

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:50.000
Game that's like oh we gotta have some reference to Mario in it

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
Gotta have it

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
Even I remember like was it Need for Speed

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
Most Wandered or something

01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:00.000
It had cars based off of the Mario Kart cars or something

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
It's just

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
It's neat I guess

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
But when you do it in every single game

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
When there's an homage to Mario in every goddamn game

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
That's third party

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
What are we going to get in Assassin's Creed

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
Are we going to have a Mario hat in Assassin's Creed

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
Watch Dogs

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
Are you going to have a Mario hat in Watch Dogs

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
I mean come on

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
They showed us some more footage

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
From Wind Waker HD and A Link Between Worlds

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
And I am so here for A Link Between Worlds

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
That's like my most anticipated 3DS title right now

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
Pretty interesting

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
Little virtual console tidbit

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
A game they're going to put out on the 3DS eShop

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
Summer Carnival 92

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
Wrecka

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
Wrecka? Oh my god that game's awesome

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
It's so rare too

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
I might have done Wrecka

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
It's a neat game

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
For a NES game

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
And they actually acknowledge this shit is rare

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
And now everybody's going to be able to play it

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
So that was kind of neat

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
Some other things they announced for virtual console on 3DS

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
Donkey Kong, Wario Land 3

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
Super Mario Bros. 3

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
And Tecmo Bowl

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
In the Nintendo archive

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
I think a lot of that stuff is already on the Wii

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
Virtual console save maybe Wario Land 3

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
Professor Layton vs. Phoenix Wright

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
Ace Attorney that was confirmed for the US

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
A lot of people hoping that would get it localized

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
It will be in 2014

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
And then kind of their big thing they said at the end

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
Was that they were putting out a new

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
Application in the Wii U called

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
Animal Crossing Plaza

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
And I actually did download this and check it out

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
It's basically, it's another way of looking at

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
Miiverse basically

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
But it is kind of cute because you have all the little

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
Animals walking around the screen and you can

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
Click on an animal

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
And you can actually see Miiverse posts about that

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
Specific animal

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
Also it interfaces with

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
Your game card

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
So you can actually take the SD card out of your

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
3DS, put it in your Wii U

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
And get your screenshots again on Miiverse

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
Which, interesting

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
I don't know

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
It was a weird little last tease

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
But I kind of like that they're trying to push

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
The boundaries of Miiverse with some different things

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
But for me I'm going to be honest

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
It was one of those things I downloaded it once

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
But I was like, huh, neat

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
Then I turned it off and I probably won't ever run it again

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
But

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
For those that are really into sharing the creative

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
Stuff they've done in Animal Crossing it might be kind of cool

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
So those are some of the highlights

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
Of the Nintendo Direct

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
So please look forward to all those games

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
Coming out soon

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
Dark Sakura, before we get to release dates, what do you have for us?

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
Well we do have a demo

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
That's finally on the Wii U

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
Wii U eShop

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
Wii U Wii U eShop

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
It's been on the

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
American Wii U

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
eShop as well

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
Wonderful 101

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
Which I watched the trailer for

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
Last night

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
Actually this kind of makes me want

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
A Wii U again

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
Tank Tank Tank was kind of a tank

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
But

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
It's free now

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
This though, it was done by

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
Hideki Kiyama

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
Who did Beautiful Joe

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
It looks like the same feel

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
That Beautiful Joe had, which was a fun

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
Series of games

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
So I really

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
Really am excited about this one

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
It just looks really fun

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
And it had sort of that Sentai feel

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
To it, you know

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
I like Sentai

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
So I think this might be

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
The convincing factor

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
Even Dan was sort of like, ooh that looks cool

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
There are a lot of people pretty excited about this game

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
So I need to download the demo, I keep forgetting

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
I gotta screw that up

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
I would do that right now, but I need the bandwidth

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
For the show

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
Remind me to do that later

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
Have you seen anything about Wonderful 101?

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
A lot of people on my Twitter are really excited for it

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
Yeah, but we're friends with a lot of Nintendo fanboys

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
Bless their hearts

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
Bless their hearts, alright

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
To register participation

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
For this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
At vognetwork.com

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
Use the passphrase, kidney

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
Let's move on to some release dates

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
Travel around the world and see what games are coming out

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
To a store near you very soon

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
The Angry Birds Trilogy

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
On Wii and Wii U this week

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
Because they didn't get them the last time around

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
Payday 2

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
On Playstation 3 and Xbox 360

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
Phineas and Ferb

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
Quest for Cool Stuff

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
Oh my god, Phineas and Ferb

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
Xbox 360, Wii, Wii U

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
3DS and DS

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
And one week from today

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
Disney Infinity

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
PlayStation 3, Xbox 360

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
Wii, Wii U

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
And 3DS as well

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
A whole fucking ton of characters

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000
Any idea

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
What platform I should get it on

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
Because, you know

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
Like Alan said, we're Twitter friends

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
With a lot of Nintendo fanboys

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
So I'm kind of leaning towards Wii U for that reason

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
So I can play with them, but then I'm like

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
Oh god, but then I think about things like Injustice

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
Where the, you know, online was kind of out

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
Wii 360

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
I was thinking PlayStation 3

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
If you have a Wii U

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:01.000
Then the tablet acts as the ARFID chip reader

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
Does it though? Because I thought that

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
Wasn't being implemented until a patch later on

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
Although they are talking about the Pokemon Rumble

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
Because in Skylanders

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
No, it's not

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
But it's going to

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
It's going to happen for that

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
But it's definitely not going to happen for Infinity

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
Because there's too much shit that goes on that portal

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
There's like a bunch of things

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
No way that would happen

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
I know with Skylanders you need that little

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
Crystal thing

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000
That you put the thing on

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
But if you have a Wii U

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
If you have a Wii U, just put the action figure

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
On your tablet and it's like, okay, I read it

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
You have this character now

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
It's one of those features, like the IR port on the 3DS

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
Or like the DS or whatever

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
That they're never going to fucking use

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
Except for that Pokemon game

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
But you could tap your credit card on it and use that

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:51.000
Don't kid yourself

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
That'll be a thing

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
When they announced the Pokemon Rumble

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
I was like, why didn't they announce

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
A new Pokemon Snap with amazing

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
AR

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
Tablet camera support

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
I kind of wish that my son was older

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
So that he would be appreciative of this stuff

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
I can get him a Mater

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
The problem is though, to get the

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
Cars playset, it's like 40 bucks

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
For the Cars playset

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
$13 for the Mater

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
And then Disney Infinity is another like

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
$75

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
No, I'm not spending $120

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
That's estimated

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
On this stuff

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
Just to have a playable Mater

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
Besides Saint's Row 4

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
That's all that's bad

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
Teaching to play Saint's Row

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
Hell yeah

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
Alright, well this is where I would usually do the

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
Japanese release dates, but guess what

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
There's nothing until August 22nd

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
Isn't it a holiday right now?

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
I think it is, so you have things on the 22nd

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
To look forward to, like Disorder 6

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
Dungeons and Dragons Mysteria

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
We talked about that before

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
But those are all on the 22nd

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
So I'll touch on them again next week, but for now

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
It's an empty week in Japan

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
I did want to mention, because I was talking about

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
Angry Birds this earlier, my son plays Angry Birds

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
Actually, he can kind of

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
Do it, he 3-starred a level the other day

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
Oh, good job

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
Wow, that's pretty cool

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
It's a little hard for him to do it on the phone

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
That's the only game he plays so far

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
But hey, I'll take anything

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
You gotta start somewhere

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
Alright, well since I don't have Japanese releases, how about the UK?

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
We have, coming out

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
We have DuckTales Remastered on the 13th

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
Which actually, I bought that for Dan

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
The day I got fired

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
Which I shouldn't have spent money on

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
But I thought I had a job

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
He came up and said

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
My girl loves me

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
She got me DuckTales

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
Aww, I'm gonna barf

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
How much he's gonna love you when you buy him Strider

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
I know, right?

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
Also coming out is

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000
Europa Universalis 4

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000
And then Payday 2

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000
On PC

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
On the 14th, also

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000
DuckTales Remastered for PS3

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000
Alright, just a few more news stories

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000
For you guys in the classic game of the week

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
And I was a little surprised with Dark Soccer's

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
Pick this week

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
Just because it's one of those games

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000
Where you're like, oh yeah

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
You gotta do that at some point

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
I've come across

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000
Quite a few that are like, you haven't done that yet?

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
Mandatory selection

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
Alright, Loki

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
Alright

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
Let's see

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
Kinda going back to some of the changes

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
That are gonna be happening with the

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
Xbox 360, Xbox Live, all that stuff

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
As previously mentioned

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
Before, they are getting

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000
Rid of Microsoft Points

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
And are gonna be converting over to

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
Real currency

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
And this is supposed to be happening sometime in the 4th quarter

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
October-ish

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
Well, it's actually gonna take place at the end of

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
August, they're gonna convert your

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
Funds over to real money

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
But they're gonna release new cards I believe in October

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000
And they're gonna come in different

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
Nominations of

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
50 bucks, 25 dollars

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000
30 dollars, which is actually 3

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000
10 dollar cards, and 15 dollars

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000
So those are gonna be available

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000
Around October-ish

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000
And your

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
Microsoft Point cards will still work

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
Until they say they won't

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000
And the only little

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000
Bit of small fine print that you have

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000
About the points that you have on your

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000
Account, they must be spent by

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
June of 2015

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
So they are giving you 2 years

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
Instead of 1 year now, but I mean honestly

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000
You shouldn't really have that much money sitting on your account

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
It means I have to use the

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000
Card I got for my birthday

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
Well, not necessarily

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
I mean you can, you just don't

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
Yeah, you have 2 years

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000
I mean come on, you should be able to spend

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000
It in that time

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000
You got enough time

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
My digital copy of Grand Theft Auto 5

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
Buy more rock band songs, you know that's what she's gonna do

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000
I got the email blast about this

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
From Microsoft, and the way the email

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
Made it sound like it was happening

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
Now, it just said

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
With an upcoming Xbox

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
System update

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
This will take effect, it didn't actually have any dates in it

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000
Well the system update from what I'm gathering

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000
Because they like to do every single system update

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
Because they do a new band wave

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
Before a major game release

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000
So the next system update I'm betting is gonna be right before

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000
Grand Theft Auto 5

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000
And that would be the beginning of September

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
And that's when they've mentioned they're gonna convert

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000
Everything over, so it would make sense

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
And they're doing a beta right now for it

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
So it's probably very soon

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000
Yeah, probably end of August

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000
Alright

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
Well I don't know how many of y'all are fans of the

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
EverQuest series, but there was quite a bit of news

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
About EverQuest coming out this week

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000
Some expansions for

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000
EverQuest and EverQuest 2

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000
EverQuest getting a new expansion called

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
Call of the Forsaken

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000
Guess what number expansion it is for the EverQuest game

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
Guess what number?

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000
One, 37 in a row

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000
Close, it is the

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000
20th expansion for EverQuest

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000
Can you imagine? How many has World of Warcraft had?

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000
4? 5?

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000
5. 5. Is it?

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
Yeah, 5. So hopefully a 6

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
Burning Crusade

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000
Wrath of the Lich King

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000
Cataclysm, Pandaria is a 4

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000
Woah, Pandas. It's a 4

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
Because Vanilla doesn't count as a suspension

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
But we all know a 5th is coming

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000
You know, at Blizzcon this year

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000
How many people have they lost now?

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000
It's going down

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
They were 7.7 as of the last courthouse

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
Yeah, we'll see

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000
But 7.7 is still way more than any other MMO

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000
So we'll see

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
Well, I don't know

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000
We could get into a longer discussion on this

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000
About how League of Legends has a heck of a lot of people playing that

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
But it's not really measured the same way

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000
But anyway, that's another discussion

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000
Back to EverQuest, Call of the Forsaken

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000
Is the 20th expansion

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000
Where you will face off against the Dragon Lady

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000
Lendenaria

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000
And return peace to the world of Norrath

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000
As the way these things go

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000
Two shared bank slots

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000
A new heroic adventure system

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000
New gear, new raids

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000
EverQuest 2 is getting its 10th expansion

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
Tears of Vashon

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000
A new channeler class coming in with that

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000
I think one thing that caught a lot of people's attention

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000
However, is the news on EverQuest Next

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000
EverQuest Next

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000
Was shown just a little tidbits

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000
And a website up

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000
But EverQuest Next will have destructible environments

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000
And it's not like a total sandbox

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
Like playground

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000
There will be restrictions on what you can

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000
And what you can't destroy

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000
But what I thought about this

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000
There's this whole other kind of section to it

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000
Where people will be able to build their own stuff

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000
And maybe sell it

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000
Like a little transaction place

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000
And EverQuest Next is going to be a free thing

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000
I felt like a little bit of Minecraft inspiration here

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000
And a lot of the screenshots look really good

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000
And I was like, okay

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000
Being able to craft in-game and then sell it

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000
Depending on whether it has a real money aspect

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000
Or what

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000
That's very Second Life

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000
Landmark is the name of what I was thinking of

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000
You can construct a structure on a plot of land

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000
That you claim in the world

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000
And then you can sell it in the Player Studios marketplace

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
For use in EverQuest Next

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
So

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000
That's very Second Life

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000
Who's going to build the gigantic penis first?

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000
I guess

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000
I'm assuming these things have to be screened

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
Oh Rob, not everybody's into penis

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000
Okay

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000
Then boobies

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000
Anyhow, also

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000
It should be mentioned that there's also

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
An iOS and Android app

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
Happening called EverQuest Worlds

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000
Quests and minigames that will

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000
Tie into lore content and rewards

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000
In the EverQuest franchise

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000
That app is free and available now

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
If you're an EverQuest fan, there's a lot going on

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000
Right now

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000
Pretty cool

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:41.000
Teto13811 in our chat says

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000
EverQuest meets Minecraft

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
Which is kind of cool

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
I like the idea of that

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000
Let's see

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:53.000
Trying to see if anybody else is talking about it

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
At

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000
Live.vognetwork.com

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
I see some comments on the Microsoft point card thing

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
Tigerclaw says

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000
What's going to happen, I think, is Microsoft will replace

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000
Those points card with the ones similar to PlayStation Network

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000
Where you can buy a $20 or $50 card

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
Yeah, I think that's pretty much exactly what's happening

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000
Yeah

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
That comment might have come in before you read that

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
Alright, anyhow

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
That does it for the news

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
For part A

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
But we can't wrap this up

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
Until we take a trip down memory lane

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:27.000
It's a segment we call the classic game of the week

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000
Where Dark Sakura is going to step into the gaming vault

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000
And find a game that she thinks, hey

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000
Listen

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
And play this game

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
I see what you did there

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
Dark Sakura, what is the classic game of the week

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000
Classic game of the week is Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000
I told you guys, right?

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000
Like, I mean, she has to do it eventually, right?

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000
That's a really obscure deep cut, Dark Sakura

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
Right

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000
Okay, then we'll do Panorama Cotton again

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000
Jeez, Rammoral Dragon

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000
You can't do the same game twice

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000
Even though you totally did it once

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000
You know what, Rob, you know what, you know what, you know what

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000
What?

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000
So, I had to pick this music to start off with

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000
Anyway, the Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000
Also known in Japan as

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000
Zeru no Densetsu Toki no Ocarina

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000
Is, um

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000
The Nintendo 64 Zelda option

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000
The very first one that came out

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000
It came out in Japan on November 21st, 1998

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000
And North America November 23rd

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
And in Europe December 11th, same year

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000
It was originally developed for the

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000
Nintendo 64 Double D

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000
And it came out in Japan on November 21st, 1998

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000
And North America November 23rd

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000
And in Europe December 11th, same year

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000
Originally developed for the Nintendo 64 Double D

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000
But instead came out on

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000
Excuse me

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000
But instead came out for

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000
The, uh

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000
Nintendo 64

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000
So, um

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000
You play as Link, you go through Hyrule

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000
You have a, you know, completely open world

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000
I mean, for as small as it was

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000
It was an open world

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000
And you had to do several different things

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000
You time traveled, you had to solve different puzzles

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000
It's a Zelda game

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000
But it was the first of its type

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000
I really think

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000
It was, it had a really good story

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000
It was really in depth

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000
It had some very weird stuff going on in it

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000
But it didn't have that stupid moon

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000
And it didn't have Tingle

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000
So, it was a lot better than Majora's Mask

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000
Rude

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000
I know

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000
Also, um, the Guinness Book of World Records

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000
Said that Ocarina of Time was the highest rated

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000
Game ever reviewed

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000
And, uh

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000
Also for 2008 and 2010

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000
So, it gets a lot of love

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.000
Um, there was also, um

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000
Some re-releases

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000
One of them was the Ocarina of Time Master Quest

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000
That had, uh

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
The dungeons redone with new puzzles

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000
And then the collector's edition

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000
Which was a port for, uh

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000
GameCube, which

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000
We have that

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000
I've actually got the gold cartridge for

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000
Nintendo 64, which has some fun glitches

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000
In it

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000
You can do some, uh

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000
Different fun stuff

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000
So, anyway, um, like I said

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000
Roleplay game, uh, had different elements

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000
Has a Z-targeting

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000
That, uh, basically lets you

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000
Lock onto another item

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
So that you can focus on it

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000
And kill it easier

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000
That game did give me some different perspective issues

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000
But, you know, you also do

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000
Quest for the NPC, so it has a slightly

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000
MMO quality to it

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000
Um, you know, just that RPG element

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000
And so, basically, you have to get the Master Sword

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000
Kill Ganon, save Zelda

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000
The end, which is typical

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000
Uh

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000
Basically with this game

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000
It had, like I said

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000
Some various ports, re-releases

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000
It was re-released, um

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000
On the GameCube as an emulated ROM

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000
And it also had that, uh

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000
Master Quest with it

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000
And it was part of the Legend of Zelda Collector's Edition

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000
Um

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000
It also, uh

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000
The Japanese version was called

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000
Toki no Ocarina GC Ura

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000
Um

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.000
Let's see

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000
It also, uh, we had other, uh, versions

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000
That came out with, uh

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000
A GBA re-release of A Link to the Past

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000
You could buy it on Virtual Console

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000
Basically, it was available

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000
Bless you

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000
Um

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000
It was available, you know, for a while

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000
Now, like I said, there was a 64 double D version

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000
That was planned

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000
Not as Zelda, but, um

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000
It was supposed to expand the game outside of the cartridge limits

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000
And that's where that Master Quest came from

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000
Which is why the Japanese version

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000
Was called Ura

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000
Uh, we have the game on the 3DS

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000
Which is

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000
The game

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000
And, uh

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000
They probably have a

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000
Well, like it's saying here, they've actually fixed up

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000
Quite a few things that were wrong with it

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000
Um, the audio was, of course, done by Koji Kondo

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000
Rob's playing my favorite music in the game right now

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.000
The, uh

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.000
Get it out of the valley

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000
I have a special love of, uh

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000
Classical guitar

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000
Um, so anyway, yeah

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000
The game is like one of the

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000
Most loved Nintendo games of all time

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000
It's definitely, I would say

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000
Probably one of the best that ever came out

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000
On the Nintendo 64

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000
So we're just looking at an instant classic

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000
When it came out, especially given

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000
How pretty it was when it came out

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000
And, now this is something that's

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000
Actually important to me

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000
And I even remember this, because this was actually

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000
The first time I heard of Philip Glass

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000
They compared a lot of Koji Kondo's music

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000
In this to Philip Glass

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000
And, basically

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000
Um

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000
This composer came into

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000
Discussion recently

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000
In, uh, helping people with

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000
Autistic meltdowns overcome them

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000
By listening to minimalist music

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000
And I, it made me think

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000
That back, you know, when I was, you know

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000
Playing through this game, if ever I found

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000
Myself in, uh

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000
A situation where I felt

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000
Overwhelmed, I'd go listen to Zelda music

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000
And calm down, the same way I listened to Philip Glass

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000
And calm down, so I thought it was very

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000
Interesting that that stylistic

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000
Uh, comparison was drawn between the music

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000
And that I react to both of them in the same way

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000
So it was pretty cool

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000
This was the game that made me

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000
Go out and buy an N64

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000
Unpopular opinion time, but I

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000
Played Mario 64 for about 30 minutes

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000
And I'm like, this is confusing and weird, I don't like it

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000
This is muddy as shit

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000
I was at, I was the age

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000
Where being a fanboy came to you very easily

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000
I was what, what year was this?

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000
97?

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.000
Yeah, I've been like 18 or 19, yeah

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.000
Yeah, or 19 or 20, so yeah, being a fanboy came

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000
Very naturally to me, um, but for this

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000
I was like, okay, this 3D is amazing

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000
And I bought Ocarina of Time

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000
With an N64, bought them both, took them up

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000
Up to the counter at Electronics Boutique

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000
And, um, I bought other N64 games

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.000
Like Ogre Battle 64

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.000
Paper Mario, never played them

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000
Bought them, never played them, I played Ocarina

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.000
Beat it, never touched my N64 again

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000
See, my Rabid fanboy thing

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.000
Which, you know, to some extent

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000
Still kind of holds to this day, is

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.000
I really resented the transition to 3D

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000
And I just always preferred A Link to the Past

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000
And I think I still do to this day

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000
I just, you know, and I understand why this game has this

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000
I don't think this is a bad game

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000
So get off my back

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.000
It's not my thing

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.000
I had a really hard time adjusting to the 3D

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.000
Just like with me, you know, my unpopular opinion

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:18.000
I guess, is that

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:20.000
I liked Wind Waker better than

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000
Ocarina of Time

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.000
The visuals just

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.000
Turned me off so much from the game

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.000
That maybe I just didn't give it a chance

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000
But I just don't care

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.000
I mean, I liked Wind Waker

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000
I really honestly wish it carried on with that kind of visual style

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.000
Because imagine recreating

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.000
A Link to the Past in that style

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.000
Where it's full 3D

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000
That'd be fucking amazing

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.000
And at one point, spoiler, in Wind Waker

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000
You kind of see what that might have been like

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000
And I was just like

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.000
Why don't they do that?

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.000
Why didn't they do something like that?

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.000
I would be cool to see them do like

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.000
A remake of Ocarina of Time

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000
Like HD, you know

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.000
Actually, not just up res everything

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:02.000
But recreate the game

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:04.000
Redo all the 3D visuals

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.000
What if they did it in the style of Twilight Princess?

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.000
See, I didn't really play Twilight Princess

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.000
I bought it, and I didn't really

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000
Twilight Princess was finally when I came around to accept the 3D Zelda

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.000
Twilight Princess was great

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.000
There's a part in this game, Ocarina of Time

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.000
That did make me a little emotional too at that age

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.000
I was very sad

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.000
The green girl, the little forest girl

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:24.000
Who has a crush on Link

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:26.000
Sorry, yeah

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:28.000
When you are older and you have to find the seven sages

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:30.000
That are going to banish Ganon

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.000
She's one of them, and there's this scene where now

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:34.000
She has to go off and she's never going to see Link again

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.000
And he's older and she's the same age

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000
And you can kind of tell that she has a thing for him

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.000
I just was very like

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000
I teared up at that

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000
She was a very sad character for me

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.000
But how many of us that played the game

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000
Screamed at the owl when you accidentally made him start over?

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000
Yeah, yeah

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.000
Spam, spam, spam, spam, spam, spam

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000
Did you hear what I said? No

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:56.000
You're like, exit, exit, exit

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:58.000
Shit

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000
So yeah, Saria, that was it

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.000
I knew it was something like that

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.000
So yeah, Ocarina of Time

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.000
It was a great game

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000
I think some people underappreciated it

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000
But it was the one

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.000
That bridged the gap from

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.000
The old era to the new

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.000
And for me

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000
There was just so much stuff in it

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000
I loved the Gerudo

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.000
I loved going around

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:26.000
And the one level that I really hated doing though

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:30.000
Was the cave

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.000
That was all spirally

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.000
That was kind of a pain in the butt

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000
There was also the water dungeon or the ice dungeon

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:38.000
And Zelda is notorious for having ice dungeons

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:40.000
Where you're like, fuck

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.000
The water dungeon was actually really fun to me

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:44.000
But it was also probably one of the only levels in that game

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.000
That made me actually sick

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.000
So yeah, Ocarina of Time

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.000
Alright

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:52.000
And I'll even say that to this day

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.000
The best way I like to play it

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:56.000
Is busting out the 64

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.000
Popping in that gold cartridge

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000
I'm getting my link on

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.000
Alright

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.000
There it is folks, your classic game of the week

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.000
Legend of Zelda

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:08.000
The Ocarina of Time

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.000
One of the true true classes

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.000
Considered by some to be the greatest game of all time

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.000
So there you go

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.000
The Guinness Book of World Records said something about it

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.000
Alright

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.000
We got plenty more Orange Launch Radio to come

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000
After a quick break

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.000
We're going to do some rapid fire news of course

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:26.000
We're going to talk about some of the game recording stuff

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.000
For Xbox One and PlayStation 4

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.000
Little clarifications coming out on that this week

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.000
And Nintendo fighting piracy

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000
Yet again we'll talk more about that

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.000
And some rumors about the PlayStation Vita

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000
That's right, the Vita, it's not gone

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.000
So we got news on all of that

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:42.000
When we come back after a quick break with more

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.000
Of Orange Lounge Radio

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:52.000
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:54.000
Episode number 515

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:56.000
Already in progress

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.000
Tonight is August 11th of 2013

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.000
And having a pretty busy show here

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:02.000
Back after a week off of course

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:04.000
We weren't here last week unfortunately

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.000
But getting back in full swing

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.000
Talking about games such as Hotline Miami

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.000
Which the live listeners heard a couple tracks from the

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.000
Soundtrack

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.000
I like that, I hadn't heard any of the music yet

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.000
I like the second song a lot more than the first

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:18.000
But that was really good

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.000
I like that

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.000
Good choice Alan

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:24.000
Alright

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.000
Before we get into some rapid fire news

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.000
I just kind of wanted to plug a couple appearances

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.000
On other podcasts because I've kind of been on a roll lately

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.000
I don't know what it's about but

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.000
I will take it because I love

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:36.000
Guesting on other shows and supporting

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:38.000
Independent broadcasting and podcasting

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000
In general so I just wanted to throw out a couple

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:42.000
Plugs

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.000
One of them is a new project for our friends over

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000
At popcolts.com

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.000
You remember Tiara

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.000
And you might know Dan Shadow, I think they've both been on the show

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.000
At one point or another and some other friends

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.000
All did this thing called Order of the Chocobo

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.000
Which was a Google hangout, it was actually a video thing

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.000
That was fun, we had to make

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:00.000
A list, it was kind of like listless

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.000
But not really, making the definitive

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.000
List of the top 10 Final Fantasy

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.000
Characters

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.000
I was very humbled by what a civil discussion it was

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.000
I was expecting hair pulling

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.000
And chair throwing and I was very happy

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.000
With the way the list turned out so check that out

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.000
Popcolts.com has the archive of that available

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.000
Also just today

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:20.000
I taped a spot for a podcast

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.000
Called Game On

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.000
Epic Slam Press Edition and that's a part of

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.000
MMORPG.com

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.000
Real quick show, it's only about 30-45 minutes

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.000
But they were kind enough to have me on today

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000
Good guys over there so I believe

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.000
That will be up on Monday so check that out

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.000
I get to talk a bit about Final Fantasy 14

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.000
And you guys all know I have the other show Horde House

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.000
So I got to speak a little bit about some MMOs

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.000
They were talking about Rift and some of the other changes

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.000
Going on at Triumph so that was pretty exciting

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.000
I guess I should give another

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:48.000
Plug because I don't know if I remembered it to mention it

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.000
Two weeks ago but on the last

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.000
Gamebuoy.org show

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:54.000
Which was about music games

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.000
I was on that show and that's up on their feed now

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.000
And it might be getting

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.000
Bumped by the time you hear this by their

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.000
Most recent show they did today

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.000
Which I think they did about GamerX

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.000
But look for the show on their feed about music games

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.000
We had a great time, it was like a three hour show

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000
So it would have been a great way to fill

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.000
The time last week with no OLR

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.000
So check that out

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000
I'm having fun guessing on other podcasts

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:18.000
I'm always happy to guest on other shows

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000
I know Loki and Dark Sakura also willing as well

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.000
Be sure to hit us all up on Twitter

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.000
If you want to know our individual Twitter accounts

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.000
Best way to get ahold of me on Twitter

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000
Twitter.com slash S-K-I-E

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000
That's Skye but S-K-I-E

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000
Dark Sakura?

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000
Like I check Twitter

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000
It's Dark Sakura

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.000
It's the best way to get ahold of me

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:40.000
I'm always happy to guest on other shows

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:42.000
I'm always happy to guest on other shows

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.000
Dark Sakura

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000
It's the best way to get ahold of me

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000
D-A-R-K-S-A-K-U-R-A

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000
Or you can message me through Tumblr

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:52.000
I was going to say the tumbles

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000
I tumble a lot more

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.000
It's Kurotsubasa

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.000
K-U-R-O-U-T-S-U-B-A-S-A

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.000
Just think Blackwing

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.000
If you message me on

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.000
The Twitter I will eventually see it

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.000
And Loki, I don't know what's the best way

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:08.000
For them to get you, Twitter?

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:10.000
Twitter is fine

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.000
K-U-R-O-U-T-S-U-B-A-S-A

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.000
Twitter is fine

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.000
Alright, well let's get into some

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.000
Rapid fire news and talk about what else

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.000
Is going on in the gaming world this week

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.000
Loki, why don't you start us off

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.000
This isn't the first time games tried something like this

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000
Where they put up a really expensive

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.000
Ridiculous bundle for

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.000
An upcoming game, I think they did something like that

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:32.000
For Formula One

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.000
I think it was Formula One 2012

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.000
Where they actually had a Formula One

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.000
Car as part of the bundle

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.000
But this is the Saints Row IV

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000
The super dangerous

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000
WOD WOD edition

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.000
AKA the million dollar pack

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:48.000
It is exactly one million dollars

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.000
There is only one available

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.000
And it includes the following

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.000
Saints Row IV, the Commander in Chief edition

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.000
A Virgin Galactic space flight

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:58.000
A full size replica of the dubstep gun

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:00.000
A hostage rescue experience

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.000
Plastic surgery

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.000
Spy training day

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.000
A personal shopper

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:08.000
A capsule wardrobe

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:10.000
From all the Saints Row stuff

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:12.000
Seven nights at the top

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.000
Royale suite

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.000
In Dubai

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.000
And a partridge in a pear tree

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.000
A week for two at the Jefferson Hotel

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000
In Washington D.C.

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000
A first class flight to Washington D.C.

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.000
In Dubai

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:28.000
Lamborghini

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.000
A new Toyota Prius Plus

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:32.000
A year's insurance

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:34.000
And a year's supercar membership

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.000
One million dollars

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.000
Which apparently is not a very good deal

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.000
But my thing is though

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:42.000
It's one million dollars

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:44.000
And they couldn't even bother to

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.000
Throw in the season pass DLC

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000
I mean really

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.000
This reminds me of how

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:52.000
Like in WoW there are players with

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:54.000
Phenomenal amounts of money

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:56.000
That they didn't buy from a gold farmer

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.000
That they just have in every expansion

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000
Blizzard has to put in some mount

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:02.000
Or some treasure thing that costs like

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:04.000
Gold for like the alchemy mount

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.000
You have too much gold

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000
Make this thing

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.000
That's what this is but in real life

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.000
You have too much money

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.000
Here's a money sink for you

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.000
Just reminded me of what I should have done

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.000
In WoW before I left

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.000
That was by the Time Dragon thing

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.000
I think this is one of those stupid things

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:24.000
That generates blog headlines

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.000
Across the internet and oh look

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:28.000
It worked

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.000
Whatever

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.000
You know what if I had a million dollars

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.000
You know what I would do

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.000
I would just buy the Bugatti and leave it alone

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:38.000
Honestly though it's not really worth it

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.000
I think they've had a few sites that have actually

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.000
Broken down cost wise

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.000
And it ends up being about $600,000 worth of product

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.000
So you're kind of overspending

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.000
But if you have a million dollars to drop on a game

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:50.000
Then you probably don't give a shit about money

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.000
And you know

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.000
Bill Gates I'm looking at you come on you're a

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.000
Real fan right? Honestly if I had a million dollars

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:58.000
I'd buy a house

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.000
And pay my bills

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:02.000
But if you had so much money

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.000
Like millions of dollars

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.000
This is for the 1%

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.000
If I magically became the 1%

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:10.000
I think my brain would explode

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.000
I would know what to do

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.000
If you're so rich you have no idea how much money

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:16.000
Exactly you have because the stock market

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.000
Fluctuates so much each day then this is for you

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:20.000
When you're so rich you don't know how much money you have

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:22.000
If I had a million dollars I'd invest

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:24.000
And make a million more

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000
Just saying

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.000
If I had just one million dollars I'm not going to buy

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:30.000
A fucking game with it I mean that's stupid

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:32.000
If I had lots and lots of money

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.000
Like billions of dollars

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.000
Then yes I would drop a million dollars on a fucking game

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:38.000
Because no one thought that they would purchase it

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:40.000
And I'd be like ha I fucking purchased it

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:42.000
Next story

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.000
So this is kind of cool news

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.000
For the Oculus Rift

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.000
They're actually

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:50.000
They have a new

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.000
Chief Technical Officer

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:54.000
And that's coming from

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.000
John Carmack

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:58.000
The co-founder of id

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:00.000
Of course big fan of VR

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.000
And now

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.000
Going to be a part of the team to make the Oculus Rift

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:06.000
Awesome

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:08.000
So neat

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:10.000
We'll have to see what that comes

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:12.000
What's going to come out of that

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.000
And then last but not least

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:16.000
The thing that's been kind of taking up a few days

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:18.000
Of my time at least not entirely

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:20.000
It's this website called Salty Bet

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.000
It's really

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:24.000
I don't know it's kind of funny

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:26.000
It's basically a website

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.000
That you go and you sign up

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:30.000
And you get fake money

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:32.000
You bet on PC

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:34.000
Controlled Mugen fights

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:36.000
And for those that don't know what Mugen is

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.000
It is a basically create your own

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:40.000
Fighting game type thing

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:42.000
And so there's characters from Street Fighter

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:44.000
From all the different fighting series

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:46.000
You can possibly imagine and a bunch of other made up stuff

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.000
So you get like

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:50.000
For example in this screenshot here

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:52.000
It's the same battle between Popeye and Ash

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:54.000
From the Evil Dead versus

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:56.000
Duck Dodgers

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:58.000
And Spawn

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:00.000
Just like weird shit like that

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:02.000
If it's a character that had a sprite made of it

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:04.000
During the Genesis slash SNES

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:06.000
Era then that sprite has probably been

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:08.000
Imported into Mugen and made a character

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:10.000
I watched a fight that took place versus

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:12.000
A Dragon Ball Z character and

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:14.000
Fat Albert

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:16.000
Hey hey hey

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:18.000
I watched one earlier today

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:20.000
Popeye versus some other random

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:22.000
Street Fighter character and Pop

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:24.000
Not Popeye, Ronald McDonald

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:26.000
Versus some random Street Fighter character

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:28.000
Piccolo

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:30.000
And Ronald McDonald just kicked the shit out of

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.000
Piccolo

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:34.000
Because he's such an overpowered character that

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:36.000
Someone created because they're like

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.000
Ronald McDonald is a fighting character

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:40.000
But yeah it's kind of fun

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:42.000
Saltybet.com

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:44.000
You sign up you get 400 fake dollars

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:46.000
And then you go and you bet

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:48.000
I want to watch a Daisy

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:50.000
Fight for that hidden eye

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:52.000
Eye beam attack that Mugen

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:54.000
Daisy has

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:56.000
From Mario Kart

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:58.000
I'd have to

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.000
I'd have to see that but yeah it's funny

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:02.000
And they've got like it's just this

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:04.000
Twitch stream that they have and

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.000
You bet stuff and you can even they have a

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:08.000
Chat window and stuff on there you can

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:10.000
Check stuff out but like there's like people with a ton

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:12.000
Of money like I'm like how many fucking hours are you

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:14.000
Spending on this thing? It's ridiculous

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:16.000
And I always bet on the losers

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:18.000
Apparently because it's like

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:20.000
How do you pick you know who's gonna win

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:22.000
Between like some

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:24.000
Random anime chick and this

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:26.000
This weird screen cap of a

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:28.000
Football or you know a soccer player

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:30.000
Or something like that it's conversations you had

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:32.000
When you were 10 I bet

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:34.000
That Superman would lose a fight against that one

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:36.000
Battletoad like I mean that's what

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:38.000
Mugen is basically once I tried

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:40.000
To like find Mugen and install it

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:42.000
And get some character packs I couldn't figure

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:44.000
Out where the hell this thing is like it's buried

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:46.000
On some Japanese forum somewhere I just

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:48.000
Tried to Google download Mugen play

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:50.000
Mugen for example I'm gonna tell you something

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:52.000
I have a disc from 7 years ago

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.000
A CD from 7 years ago that has an

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.000
Install of Mugen on it I don't know who these

01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:58.000
Characters I mean I know who one of these characters

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.000
Is but I don't know who both these characters is but right now

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:02.000
Are you salty betting during the show?

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:04.000
No right now they have it's it's Fox

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:06.000
McCloud versus Hawkage I guess

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:08.000
He's from looks like Naruto

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:09.200
Um so

01:44:09.200 --> 01:44:10.000
Hakage?

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:12.000
Hakage I guess yes I can't I can't

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:14.000
Fucking read Japanese today

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:16.000
Hakage so it's Fox McCloud versus

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:18.000
Hakage and Fox McCloud yes Fox McCloud

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:20.000
Is definitely favored

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:22.000
To win so but uh yeah

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:24.000
Just an example of some of the matchups you see

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:26.000
Right there I don't know I had it on the other

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:28.000
Day while I was doing other things and they thought

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.000
It was funny all right let's move

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:32.000
On now earlier in the show

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:34.000
I was yelled out

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:36.000
Yelled at in private message by

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:38.000
My good pal Shane Alinko

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:40.000
When I said that I was most

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:42.000
Looking forward to on the 3DS the

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:44.000
Link Between Two Worlds

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:46.000
Zelda remake because he said how dare you

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:48.000
Pokemon X and Y still isn't out

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:50.000
So fine here you go Shane

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:52.000
Here's a Pokemon X and Y story

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:54.000
For me to butcher and it's

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:56.000
About something you were expressing to me earlier this week

01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:58.000
Mega Evolutions

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:00.000
That's right the Pokemon company

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:02.000
Unveiled more information

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:04.000
On Mega Evolutions

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:06.000
Such as Mewtwo

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:08.000
Can undergo this change during battle

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:10.000
But the effects would only last for the duration of the battle

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:12.000
In order for this to happen

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:14.000
Pokemon has to hold a mega stone

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.000
Item but there are

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:18.000
Different ones unique to different creatures

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.000
In order to get these abilities

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.000
There were also new screens and there was a new

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.000
Trailer that was released for this

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:26.000
That talks about how to use this

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:28.000
What is this super training is also

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:30.000
A thing where you can increase a Pokemon's

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:32.000
Base stats by playing mini games

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:34.000
Such as a soccer style game

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:36.000
And core training workouts as well

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:38.000
That will allow your Pokemon to slowly improve

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:40.000
Their stats on their own

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.000
I want to hear more about the fashion shoots and all that

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:44.000
Kind of crap that they're going to have in the game

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:46.000
And when this story was announced all of the

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.000
Pokemon theory crafters and min-maxers

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:50.000
Simultaneously got a boner and an aneurysm

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.000
Act Deaf

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:54.000
Says Digimon will sue

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:56.000
Pokemon min-maxers

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:58.000
Are crazy

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:00.000
It's one of the reasons I can't

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:02.000
Get into Pokemon as much as some

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:04.000
People like Shane is that there's

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:06.000
There's too fucking much

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:08.000
Like it's just like oh my god

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:10.000
It's like I gotta do this and then I gotta get these

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:12.000
Items and I gotta min-max this and I gotta do

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:14.000
A fucking fashion shoot on the side like

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:16.000
God damn

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:18.000
You know what? I was fine with

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:20.000
151 Pokemon

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:22.000
I was fine with taking their pictures in Snap

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:24.000
Yeah that was fun

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:26.000
The rest of this shit is too much

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:28.000
You know okay I did get some free plushies

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:30.000
At E3 which I gave to Julie

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:32.000
But you know what?

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:34.000
Shane does have a career

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:36.000
The new bunny Pokemon is super cute by the way

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:38.000
He's super derpy and I love it

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:40.000
I wanna see the derpiness

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:42.000
Although I do like when people do

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:44.000
Memes with the old

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:46.000
That looks like a derp

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:48.000
Isn't he adorable though?

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:50.000
What is up with those ears?

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:52.000
He's kind of like the

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:54.000
What's the one they have all the memes about?

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:56.000
Psyduck?

01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:58.000
The beaver

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:00.000
The beaver looking one

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:02.000
Bidoof

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:04.000
Squirtle help I'm on fire

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:06.000
LOL Bidoof

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:08.000
Squirtle I'm dying

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:10.000
I haven't seen this

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:12.000
Alright

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:14.000
I just like the Diglett memes

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:16.000
Far too much Pokemon content for one show

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:18.000
Shut it down

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:20.000
Hearthstone is Blizzard's free to play

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:22.000
Card game

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:24.000
It's gonna be in beta soon

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:26.000
And they're saying it's not really

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:28.000
But it's not far away either

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:30.000
I'm not sure what the hell that's supposed to mean

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:32.000
But they're saying here's the quote about it

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:34.000
We're not days away from launching

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:36.000
The beta but we're not months away

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:38.000
Either

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:40.000
At the Hearthstone announcement we committed into going to beta testing

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:42.000
Before the summer was over

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:44.000
And the team has been pulling out all the stops to make that happen

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:46.000
Well if you think about it summer isn't really over

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:48.000
Until September 21st

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:50.000
So there's still a little bit of time

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.000
But one can hope it will be there

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:54.000
Before the end of August

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:56.000
For Saints Row 4

01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:58.000
Even I'm excited about this game honestly

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:00.000
I gotta get it at some point

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:02.000
The soundtrack list has been revealed

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:04.000
109 tracks in this game

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:06.000
Good lord

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:08.000
I am not gonna read all 109 songs

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:10.000
Off of this list

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:12.000
But I will just point out

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:14.000
Especially because there's a lot of classical songs

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:16.000
Since they have the classical station

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:18.000
But I will point out I was very excited to see

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:20.000
Hadaway What Is Love is in the game

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:22.000
And apparently it's one of those songs that's used at a key moment

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:24.000
Opposites Attract

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:26.000
Do the safety dance

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:28.000
Montel Jordan

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:30.000
This is how we do it

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:32.000
I just laughed because Oh Shit is in it

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:34.000
Lump by Pussa

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:36.000
Oh Shit is in it

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:38.000
Obviously the mix station is gonna be the best

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:40.000
Saints Row 4 soundtrack

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:42.000
More information there

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:44.000
DarkSakura

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:46.000
What do you got?

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:48.000
Well I have some stuff

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:50.000
First of all there is a Tomb Raider

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:52.000
Sequel that has been confirmed

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:54.000
By the Square CEO

01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:56.000
Well at least the American slash

01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:58.000
European Phil Rogers

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:00.000
CEO

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:02.000
Basically they're also gonna be doing

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:04.000
A comic book that

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:06.000
Is a bridge between the games

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:08.000
And I knew about this because Gail Simone

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:10.000
Actually said something about it and you know I follow her Tumblr

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:12.000
She

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:14.000
Sorta let that slip early

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:16.000
So I'm looking forward to that

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:18.000
Cause I have liked what I've played so far

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:20.000
With Tomb Raider I just need to play more of it

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:22.000
Or as we call it here at OLR

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:24.000
Girl

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:26.000
Lara Croft's

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:28.000
Incredible no good

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:30.000
Very bad day

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:32.000
Whatever that book was called

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:34.000
And then there is a fan

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:36.000
Petition out for Smash Brothers

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:38.000
And they want to make

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:40.000
Reggie Fils-Aime a playable character

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:42.000
Yep you can sign

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:44.000
The Nintendo and that he

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:46.000
Uses Nintendo controllers and characters

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:48.000
To his advantage as attacks

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:50.000
And

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:52.000
They are basically

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:54.000
Encouraging Twitter users to

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:56.000
Basically message Masahiro Sakurai

01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:58.000
To

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:00.000
Have Reggie in the game

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:02.000
I think that would be awesome

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:04.000
He has to have

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:06.000
You remember Norimaro in

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:08.000
Marvel Super Heroes

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:10.000
He was the Japanese

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:12.000
He was only the Japanese version

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:14.000
The comedian who was wearing the boys uniform

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:16.000
He could do a version like that for Reggie

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:18.000
With the big head that's like super

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:20.000
Exaggerated features and everything

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:22.000
His jaw should be an attack

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:24.000
I kind of agree with Fifth Dream in our chat room

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:26.000
At live.vognetwork.com

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:28.000
LOL fan petition

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:30.000
Yeah but it would be funny

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:32.000
And weirder things have happened

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:34.000
By the way Tekken X Street Fighter

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:36.000
Is still in development

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:38.000
They haven't given up and it should be

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:40.000
Better than Street Fighter X Tekken

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:42.000
Was

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:44.000
I hate this way

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:46.000
These stupid

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:48.000
Well let me say this from Stan in our chat room

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:50.000
Because I like this comment too

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:52.000
I thought Stan Lee would have been cool in Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:54.000
Yes

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:56.000
Yes

01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:58.000
So they're looking though

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:00.000
With this to build a bigger community

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:02.000
For the fighting game fans

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:04.000
By combining not just putting the Tekken fans

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:06.000
And the Street Fighter fans together

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:08.000
But really making it one big whole community

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:10.000
So we'll see

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:12.000
If it's better than the Capcom attempt

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:14.000
Then I'll be happy

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:16.000
Ta-da

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:18.000
Alright there it is your rapid fire news

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:20.000
Let's get to the foogle question of the week

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:30.000
Every week we ask a question of our Facebook

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:32.000
And Google Plus communities

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:34.000
But this week was a little different

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:36.000
Because unfortunately due to some of the other podcasts

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:38.000
I was doing and being sick

01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:40.000
And having to get Jamie tonight

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:42.000
Because she's without a car

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:44.000
My battery died

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:46.000
I was not able to prep the show in a timely manner

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:48.000
So I was like alright well we're not going to have enough time

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:50.000
To get decent replies tonight

01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:52.000
So let's mix it up a little bit

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:54.000
And do a segment instead

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:56.000
That we have not done on Orange Lounge Radio

01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:58.000
In a very very long time

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:00.000
It's a segment we call

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:02.000
Ask Orange Lounge

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:04.000
God

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:06.000
Let's ask Orange Lounge

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:08.000
Some stupid question

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:10.000
What will we find out this week

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:12.000
On Orange Lounge Radio

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:14.000
I bet a lot of people

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:16.000
Didn't know I usually sing the theme

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:18.000
And now they're happy that we don't do this segment

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:20.000
A lot anymore

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:22.000
Made up every time

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:24.000
Can you believe it? I'm a regular Wayne Brady over here

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:26.000
Alright let's start with

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:28.000
Facebook

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:30.000
Red the Haze starts us off tonight

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:32.000
What is a man?

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:34.000
A miserable little pile of secrets

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:36.000
Weren't you paying attention?

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:38.000
Yes

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:40.000
Rob himself says

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:42.000
Why is there no Loki and Dan show?

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:44.000
That would be epic

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:46.000
Why isn't there a Loki and Dan show?

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:48.000
You guys should just look at each other and yell for an hour

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:50.000
It'll be fun

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:52.000
I would leave the house

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:54.000
You wouldn't see me while the whole thing was going on

01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:56.000
We wouldn't yell at each other we'd probably agree a lot

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:58.000
Actually yell in unison

01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:00.000
It would be the two dudes up in the balcony from the Muppet show

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:02.000
That would be awesome

01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:04.000
That would be awesome

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:06.000
You need to channel that

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:08.000
I'm going to make the suggestion to Dan then

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:10.000
That you do the Grumpy Guy show

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:12.000
Alright, Jose Osumu-Rigaro wants to know

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:14.000
What's the one game you thought you wouldn't enjoy

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:16.000
But you ended up loving

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:18.000
I only asked because I thought I wasn't going to enjoy

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:20.000
Hitman Absolution nearly as much as I am

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:22.000
The one game you thought you wouldn't enjoy

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:24.000
But you ended up loving

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:26.000
Easy for me, Mass Effect

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:28.000
I'd have to say

01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:30.000
That was one for me too

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:32.000
And Borderlands 2 actually

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:34.000
I like it

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:36.000
Alan, anything you can think of?

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:38.000
I'm blanking, I'm sorry

01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:40.000
That's alright, Loki, anything?

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:42.000
Minecraft

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:44.000
Ronnie B says if you could design your own game for the Oculus Rift

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:46.000
What would it be like?

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:48.000
It would be like F-Zero

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:54.000
If I had to do one

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:56.000
It would be

01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:58.000
It would be

01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:00.000
I don't know

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:02.000
I was going to try to think of something really pervy

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:04.000
to say

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:06.000
It would be like Superhero Dress Up

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:08.000
There's plenty of perv content already on Oculus Rift

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:10.000
Anybody else? Alan?

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:12.000
A game like Rez

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:14.000
What was that Fireworks game that was a launch game for the PS2?

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:16.000
Phantom Vision

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:18.000
Something like that

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:20.000
Phantom Vision is a fun game

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:22.000
Pretty rave

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:24.000
Drug induced game on the Oculus Rift

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:26.000
Ragenator says

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:28.000
Train A is traveling south

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:30.000
from Butte, Montana at 78 miles an hour

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:32.000
Train B is traveling east to Pax East

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:34.000
with Cliffy B as a passenger

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:36.000
How much bacon can Loki eat in one sitting

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:38.000
without getting explosive bacon grease diarrhea?

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:40.000
That's disgusting

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:42.000
He's not doing that in our apartment

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:44.000
I don't

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:46.000
get explosive diarrhea from bacon

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:48.000
It just ends up getting so heavy

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:50.000
It depends on how hungry I am

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:52.000
And how crispy the bacon is

01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:54.000
That is what it comes down to

01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:56.000
How crispy the bacon is

01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:58.000
If it's all fatty and greasy

01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:00.000
You can't eat very much of it

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:02.000
If it's really crispy then you can eat a ton of it

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:04.000
If it's not very crispy that means it's well lubricated

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:06.000
You guys are disgusting

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:08.000
We didn't ask the question

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:10.000
That's true

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:12.000
It's Ragenator's fault

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:14.000
Ragenator you're banned

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:16.000
Get something to slap him with in the chat room

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:18.000
I apologize for the Facebook noises

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:20.000
I still haven't disabled it

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:23.000
Bobby Blackwolf

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:25.000
Asking the heavy hitting question here

01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:27.000
With all of the heavy topics

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:29.000
That are discussed on OLR throughout the years

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:31.000
There are many questions that one could ask

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:33.000
The Lounge of Orange

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:35.000
Some are philosophical, some are personal

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:37.000
Others are about the best ways to roast a ferret

01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:39.000
However there is one question

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:41.000
And one question only

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:43.000
That dictates the future of gaming

01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:45.000
And the revelry of gaming's past

01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:47.000
Why the beep can you not accept

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:49.000
That Chrono Trigger and Earthbound are better

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:51.000
Than Super Metroid

01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:53.000
Because you're wrong

01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:55.000
What is actually a rhetorical question

01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:57.000
Because the only acceptable answer is

01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:59.000
You speak the truth Bobby

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:01.000
And now I accept your conclusion as fact

01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:03.000
It has been written on the internet

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:05.000
And lo it is true

01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:07.000
Well

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:09.000
First of all it's pronounced gif

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:11.000
Second of all no

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:13.000
I've actually prepared an answer

01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:15.000
Oh really

01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:17.000
For this

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:19.000
So here's my answer

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:21.000
Drum roll please

01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:23.000
One more please

01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:25.000
Because fuck you

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:27.000
That's why

01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:29.000
Thank you and good night

01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:31.000
Do do do do do do do

01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:33.000
No I just

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:35.000
Okay look

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:37.000
There's something about the fact

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:39.000
That Super Metroid is something that you can

01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:41.000
Play in like you know one sitting

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:43.000
And really kind of do like the speed runs

01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:45.000
And collect all the items

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:47.000
I love the music in Super Metroid

01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:49.000
And I don't know

01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:51.000
How to put my finger on it

01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:53.000
I just fucking love that game

01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:55.000
And really they don't make Metroid games like it anymore

01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:57.000
It's just

01:56:57.000 --> 01:56:59.000
But they do make Castlevania games like it

01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:01.000
They do they do

01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:03.000
And I don't hate Chrono Trigger

01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:05.000
And I especially don't hate Earthbound

01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:07.000
In fact I got Earthbound on Wii U Virtual Console

01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:09.000
And it's fun

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:11.000
You know what I found the other day?

01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:13.000
Earthbound the cartridge

01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:15.000
Dan and I were actually playing through Super Mario World

01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:17.000
I asked the other game I forgot to say it was playing

01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:19.000
Was to cheer me up Dan and I

01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:21.000
Drank wine and played Super Mario World

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:23.000
Alright three hour show and look how many questions I gotta get through

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:25.000
Alright

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:27.000
Tim Tripp wants to know why not Zoidberg?

01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:31.000
What?

01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:33.000
Why not Zoidberg? You're laughing over there Logan

01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:35.000
Is that Futurama?

01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:37.000
Because he sheds his skin

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:39.000
And he's gross

01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:41.000
That show got cancelled anyway

01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:43.000
Didn't it?

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:45.000
It got cancelled again

01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:47.000
Stan H wants to know if you were in a Final Fantasy game

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:49.000
What would be your job class?

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:53.000
I want to do a summoner because I want to summon

01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:55.000
Cute little creatures to do my bidding

01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:57.000
I'd be Realm

01:57:57.000 --> 01:57:59.000
Where I would draw everything that I want into existence

01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:01.000
And have them beat the shit out of everybody

01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:03.000
Here's a horde of cute ponies

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:05.000
Stop

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:07.000
Alan?

01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:09.000
I'd be Sebastian because he was super hot and built

01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:11.000
I liked, I don't remember what the class was

01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:13.000
In Final Fantasy 6

01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:15.000
It was Edgar, I think he was like an engineer

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:17.000
Or something like that, because he had a fucking chainsaw

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:19.000
And that's awesome

01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:21.000
And he had a railgun

01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:23.000
Jeremy, our buddy from Koopa Club wants to know

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:25.000
Do you even lift?

01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:27.000
No

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:29.000
How much can you bench DarkSakura?

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:31.000
Who's raising her hand?

01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:33.000
I actually don't bench, I do deadlifts

01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:35.000
And I'm up to 60 pounds now

01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:37.000
Wow

01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:39.000
That doesn't mean anything

01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:41.000
It's 2013

01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:43.000
Well I mean, but for the most part

01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:45.000
For any

01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:47.000
For people who don't know, I actually

01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:49.000
Am working into powerlifting because I can't do heavy

01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:51.000
Cardio because of bad joints

01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:53.000
God damn it, Codeman, stop setting off my Facebook

01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:55.000
But I actually

01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:57.000
Do deadlifts and

01:58:57.000 --> 01:58:59.000
I'm going to be starting bench pressing and doing

01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:01.000
Other powerlifting, so that was a good question

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:03.000
I do live lifts

01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:05.000
Like 30 pounds, or 35 pounds

01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:07.000
Of live person that I lift up

01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:09.000
On a daily basis

01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:11.000
I'm going to lift this question and throw it out of the show

01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:13.000
Alright, Renee

01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:15.000
Also from Koopa Club wants to know

01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:17.000
What's your favorite crepe?

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:19.000
Oh my god, those crepes at the

01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:21.000
Cute little place in Japantown

01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:23.000
There's this picture of me on Twitter

01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:25.000
With a spike from Game Buoy

01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:27.000
And look at the crepes

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:29.000
Zoom in on the crepes in that picture because they're adorable

01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:31.000
They're crepes that are so cute you almost feel bad

01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:33.000
For wanting to eat it, but you eat it anyway

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:35.000
I will say though, as far as savory crepes go

01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:37.000
There's a place here in Sacramento

01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:39.000
Called Crepeville

01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:41.000
They have this curry crepe that's really good

01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:43.000
Danielle's crepes

01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:45.000
In Sacramento, I was pointing out to you on the way here

01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:47.000
Very, very good

01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:49.000
Chicken crepes

01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:51.000
Degenerate Johnny says, since Rob often asks

01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:53.000
This question to every guest on OLR

01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:55.000
I'd like to know your answers to the question

01:59:55.000 --> 01:59:57.000
What is your favorite game of all time?

01:59:57.000 --> 01:59:59.000
Note, if you can't immediately name one game

01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:01.000
The closest thing would be your favorite game

02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:03.000
As addressed earlier in this segment

02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:05.000
Super Metroid

02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:07.000
Guardian Legend

02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:09.000
Valkyrie Profile

02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:11.000
Grand Theft Auto V

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:13.000
Did you see the

02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:15.000
How to basic video for how to install

02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:17.000
Grand Theft Auto V?

02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:19.000
Then I watched all of his

02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:21.000
In fact, we were watching it at lunch

02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:23.000
I was showing my son

02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:25.000
Those videos and he's like

02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:27.000
What's he doing?

02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:29.000
Alright

02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:31.000
Fifth Dream says

02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:33.000
For each member of the cast, if you could listen

02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:35.000
To only one album

02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:37.000
For the rest of your lives

02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:39.000
What would you pick?

02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:41.000
Ooh, this is hard

02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:43.000
One album for the rest of your lives

02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:45.000
What would you pick?

02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:47.000
Anyone?

02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:49.000
Okay, Loki? Well, just because I was listening to it

02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:51.000
For about a couple months already

02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:53.000
So, Onomatoguchi

02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:55.000
Endless Fantasy

02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:57.000
Okay

02:00:57.000 --> 02:00:59.000
I'm not sure

02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:01.000
I think I know how I want to answer this

02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:03.000
But I'm not sure

02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:05.000
Okay, it would be between

02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:07.000
I can't narrow it down to one

02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:09.000
It would be between Tragic Kingdom by No Doubt

02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:11.000
Or

02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:13.000
LCD Sound Systems

02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:15.000
Actually, I think it's going to be

02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:17.000
LCD Sound Systems' second album, Sound of Silver

02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:19.000
That would be my album

02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:21.000
Either it would be

02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:23.000
Alanis Morissette's Jagged Little Pill

02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:25.000
Or Echo Image's CompuPhonic

02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:27.000
No, ABBA?

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:29.000
ABBA Gold? ABBA Gold, I know

02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:31.000
I know, but it's only one album

02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:33.000
Only one

02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:35.000
For me, I'd probably have to say Pearl Jam's 10

02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:37.000
Because honestly, that is one of the few albums

02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:39.000
I can listen to all the way through

02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:41.000
Or maybe

02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:43.000
God, what was that? Beatles album

02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:45.000
Because now I can see it in my head

02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:47.000
And I know the name of it

02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:49.000
Revolver, Rubber Soul

02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:51.000
Thank you

02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:53.000
I knew it was one of the R ones

02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:55.000
But I used to own

02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:57.000
Actually, I do, again, own a copy of Rubber Soul

02:01:57.000 --> 02:01:59.000
And it's my favorite Beatles album to this day

02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:01.000
Those were the transitional albums where they went from

02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:03.000
doing bubblegum pop to the really weird

02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:05.000
metaphorical stuff

02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:07.000
Rubber Soul and Revolver

02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:09.000
both were such good albums

02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:11.000
Now we have people in the chat room

02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:13.000
giving their answers

02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:15.000
I like Teto's answer, Throwing Copper

02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:17.000
Metallica's Black Album was really good

02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:19.000
Fifth Dream, The Cure with Wish

02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:21.000
Ooh, another good one

02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:23.000
You know what I would pick for an album?

02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:25.000
My iTunes library

02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:27.000
Depends how long I've been alive

02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:29.000
I mean, if we're talking like, you know, I've been alive

02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:31.000
for hundreds of years and probably Christmas speed

02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:33.000
so I'd kill myself

02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:35.000
Alright

02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:37.000
Let's move on. Gamergirl says

02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:39.000
If Animal Crossing New Leaf really

02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:41.000
existed, what animal would you

02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:43.000
be and why?

02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:45.000
I wanna go last

02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:47.000
I'd be human. Because I'm the main character

02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:49.000
And I'm the fucking mayor

02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:51.000
So fuck all of your

02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:53.000
animals. I am not gonna be

02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:55.000
a nice dog

02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:57.000
like, um, what's his face in my

02:02:57.000 --> 02:02:59.000
town. I'm gonna hit Ed

02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:01.000
over the face with a bug net

02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:03.000
kick that bitch out of my town

02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:05.000
and run it for money

02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:07.000
Alan, you be the gay unicorn

02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:13.000
I'd be a

02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:15.000
gazelle

02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:17.000
Loki

02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:19.000
Poacher

02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:21.000
Which one's poacher?

02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:23.000
A poacher

02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:25.000
as in a hunter that kills the animals

02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:27.000
No

02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:29.000
Uh, and my answer is

02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:31.000
I would be Tom Nook. Now give me my money

02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:33.000
Fuck no, I have a gun

02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:35.000
Alright

02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:37.000
I'm glad none of us said

02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:39.000
Sahara

02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:41.000
Because Sahara really likes carpet

02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:43.000
Is that the one

02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:45.000
Is that the one that's like a boy in the

02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:47.000
Japanese version? Gracie

02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:49.000
I would be Gracie, let's be real

02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:51.000
Sahara is the, uh, the wallpaper

02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:53.000
and carpet merchant who comes

02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:55.000
and redoes your house with the most god awful

02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:57.000
ugly shit ever that you pay three thousand bills for

02:03:57.000 --> 02:03:59.000
Alright, we got four more on Facebook to get through

02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:01.000
here. Uh, DJ Melvis

02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:03.000
our good pal says, it's you

02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:05.000
versus the Grin Reaper in a

02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:07.000
duel for your life. You must

02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:09.000
choose three different games. One

02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:11.000
8-bit console game, one 16-bit

02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:13.000
console game, and one arcade game

02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:15.000
open choice, to have a score

02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:17.000
battle or timed run against

02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:19.000
him. What you bring into the

02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:21.000
duel? You gotta throw down with the

02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:23.000
Grin Reaper an 8-bit game, a 16-bit

02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:25.000
game, and an arcade game. What you

02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:27.000
bring into the duel? Ooh, this

02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:29.000
is a toughie. I know what my time run would be

02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:31.000
Okay I would actually break it into Super Mario

02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:33.000
Brothers, the very, the first one

02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:35.000
I shouldn't say that about Mario 2 because

02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:37.000
I'm really fast on speed runs for that game

02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:39.000
My score one would actually

02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:41.000
be Kirby's Avalanche

02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:43.000
on Super Nintendo. Ooh, okay

02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:45.000
My arcade one would probably be

02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:47.000
the first Killer Instinct. Wow

02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:49.000
I was really good at it. Dang, you didn't even

02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:51.000
get prepped on that question in advance. Anybody

02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:53.000
else want to take a stab at this? I don't even know

02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:55.000
Anything that I was super awesome at when I was

02:04:55.000 --> 02:04:57.000
like 12 I'm out of practice with so I'd be

02:04:57.000 --> 02:04:59.000
screwed if that was the duel

02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:01.000
Um,

02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:03.000
gosh

02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:05.000
Tetris

02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:07.000
Uh, 8-bit game

02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:09.000
I would pick

02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:11.000
E.T. because I was actually fairly decent

02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:13.000
at that. You're going way before 8-bits

02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:15.000
That's like a 2-bit game

02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:17.000
Tetris is your 8-bit game

02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:19.000
Master System or

02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:21.000
Tetris? Yeah

02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:23.000
And then what's Super Nintendo?

02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:25.000
I have lots of points

02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:27.000
Um,

02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:29.000
Kirby's

02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:31.000
Superstar

02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:33.000
I dominate that game, arcade game

02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:35.000
Uh,

02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:37.000
Klax

02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:39.000
Alright, um

02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:41.000
For me, arcade game, easy

02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:43.000
DDR. Even though I'm not the best

02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:45.000
at it, I can take on most people even in my old

02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:47.000
age. Death does have to deal with those heavy robes

02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:49.000
That's right, so uh, DDR, we're gonna throw down

02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:51.000
in that. 8-bit game

02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:53.000
Um, oh

02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:55.000
god, uh, anticipation

02:05:55.000 --> 02:05:57.000
And I get to be the heels

02:05:57.000 --> 02:05:59.000
And uh, 16-bit

02:05:59.000 --> 02:06:01.000
game

02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:03.000
You know, you think I would say

02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:05.000
Super Metroid, but I think I'm actually gonna go with

02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:07.000
like, I'm gonna go with Tetris Attack

02:06:07.000 --> 02:06:09.000
Because it was basically Pokemon Puzzle League and I was pretty good

02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:11.000
at that. Loki. Uh

02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:13.000
Dance Dance Revolution, Super Mario

02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:15.000
Kart, and

02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:17.000
8-bit

02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:19.000
That's kinda tough

02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:21.000
Um

02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:23.000
Mario is missing

02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:25.000
What did I play a lot, fuck I didn't even play that

02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:27.000
What the fuck did I play a lot of

02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:29.000
Um

02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:31.000
Contra? No, that's still pretty

02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:33.000
fucking hard. Sky Shark was fun

02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:35.000
Um, have I done Sky Shark?

02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:37.000
I don't think so

02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:39.000
Look it up. I don't know, fuck

02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:41.000
Duck Hunt, I don't know

02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:43.000
That's hand-eye coordination

02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:45.000
I should be really good at that, so

02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:47.000
Alright, let's move on

02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:49.000
Edgar R asks, which video game had

02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:51.000
the worst ending?

02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:53.000
Mass Effect 3, Mass Effect 3, Mass Effect 3

02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:55.000
No, because they

02:06:55.000 --> 02:06:57.000
actually fixed it and made it semi-decent

02:06:57.000 --> 02:06:59.000
even if it wasn't great

02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:01.000
Like, go back to like, you know

02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:03.000
Ghouls and Ghosts, you know, where it was like

02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:05.000
Congratulation

02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:07.000
Or it was like Ghosts and Goblins, excuse me

02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:09.000
Or, hey you win

02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:11.000
you have to do it all again

02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:13.000
Oh god, what games

02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:15.000
had really crappy endings

02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:17.000
Um

02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:19.000
I don't know

02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:21.000
I mean, unless there's like the ones where you die

02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:23.000
at the end or some shit

02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:25.000
Super controversial

02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:27.000
Final Fantasy 7, because shit

02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:29.000
was not finished

02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:31.000
If Final Fantasy 7 had come out in the age of

02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:33.000
the internet, it would have been a Mass Effect 3

02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:35.000
debacle, it really would have

02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:37.000
I probably would actually say the

02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:39.000
original state of endings for Mass Effect 3

02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:41.000
I did go back and watch them

02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:43.000
I'm very glad I

02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:45.000
waited to beat the games when the extended

02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:47.000
cut came out

02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:49.000
Although, I do have to say that I really

02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:51.000
hate that

02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:53.000
Happy Ending mod, it just is not good

02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:55.000
Oh no, no

02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:57.000
It doesn't even suit it

02:07:57.000 --> 02:07:59.000
Alright, Jon R says

02:07:59.000 --> 02:08:01.000
Chrono Trigger greater than Metroid less than

02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:03.000
Secret of Evermore, why fight it Rob

02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:05.000
we're all right, even Bobby for once

02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:11.000
The only reason I read that and entertained it was the for once part, because teehee

02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:13.000
Alright, Dartetsuya asks

02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:15.000
Remember OLR presents

02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:17.000
The Hunt, based on Loki's

02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:19.000
favorite novel, Ready Player One

02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:21.000
Can we find a way to do that again?

02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:23.000
Maybe expand it beyond classic games to include

02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:25.000
more geeky stuff so more of our VOG peeps

02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:27.000
can participate, that was kind of like

02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:29.000
a relay race type of thing

02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:31.000
using classic games, right?

02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:33.000
Some modern games, yeah it would be fun to do again

02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:35.000
It would be really cool if we could, you know, because

02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:37.000
our website VOG Network is a social game after all

02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:39.000
Not to volunteer Bobby for projects

02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:41.000
because I know he's got his plate full already

02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:43.000
but maybe in 2014 that could be some

02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:45.000
type of thing we look at doing

02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:47.000
It would be fun, yeah I'd be down for it

02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:49.000
By that time maybe the movie will come out

02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:51.000
Who knows, who knows

02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:53.000
I think it would be great, especially if we could tie it into

02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:55.000
a charity thing, like everybody has to

02:08:55.000 --> 02:08:57.000
pony up ten bucks to participate

02:08:57.000 --> 02:08:59.000
and like, you know, half the pot goes to

02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:01.000
a prize maybe and the other half goes to charity

02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:03.000
or it all goes to a charity of

02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:05.000
the participant's choosing or something like that, I think it would be a really

02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:07.000
great thing

02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:09.000
Or it goes to the dark sakura and needs a job fund

02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:11.000
That's not a registered

02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:13.000
charity

02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:15.000
Alright

02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:17.000
Oh my gosh

02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:19.000
I was going to see if there were any more questions

02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:21.000
We're going to keep a couple more times

02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:23.000
Where are we?

02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:25.000
Okay, one more on

02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:27.000
Facebook

02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:29.000
Code Man wants to know if you were to cosplay

02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:31.000
what would you cosplay as?

02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:33.000
Well a lot of us have cosplay

02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:35.000
What happens I cosplay as?

02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:37.000
What would you cosplay as now?

02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:39.000
Actually I can tell you what my next cosplay is going to be

02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:41.000
My friend Chadi

02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:43.000
who I think you might have met

02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:45.000
She wanted, we did a stupid

02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:47.000
online quiz for Homestuck about what would

02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:49.000
your god tier be so we were going to just do our god tier

02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:51.000
outfits

02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:53.000
Which mine would be the self of heart

02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:55.000
I need to cosplay as Joker

02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:57.000
because I got the red beard to pull it off

02:09:57.000 --> 02:09:59.000
so I would think

02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:01.000
that would be a character I'd resemble pretty well

02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:03.000
that I could cosplay

02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:05.000
I found tutorials

02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:07.000
Talk to me later

02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:09.000
Low key

02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:11.000
Alan, any interest in cosplaying?

02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:13.000
What would you cosplay as?

02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:15.000
Um

02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:17.000
I don't know

02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:19.000
Low key

02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:21.000
There you go

02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:23.000
Um

02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:25.000
I guess I would cosplay

02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:27.000
Actually it's funny

02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:29.000
There's only two things that I kind of wanted to

02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:31.000
cosplay just because it both involves

02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:33.000
building cool things

02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:35.000
Some sort of giant mech thing

02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:37.000
Although then I'd have to learn how to walk on stilts and that sounds dangerous

02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:39.000
Or get one of those

02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:41.000
costumes that's like the

02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:43.000
really realistic looking

02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:45.000
raptor dinosaur thing

02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:47.000
Because it'd be fun to run around with that shit

02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:49.000
I just want that costume

02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:51.000
It's pretty sweet

02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:53.000
I have a better answer

02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:55.000
A replacement answer

02:10:55.000 --> 02:10:57.000
Gender swapped ooh la la

02:10:57.000 --> 02:10:59.000
That would actually be really cool

02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:01.000
I would cosplay as one of the other characters

02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:03.000
You have like orange vinyl bell bottoms

02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:05.000
That's amazing

02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:07.000
Travis over on Google Plus

02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:09.000
The lone Google Plus respondent says

02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:11.000
Hey Robin gang just finished Tomb Raider

02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:13.000
And was going to start on Deus Ex Human Revolution

02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:15.000
Was wondering what you all thought about each game

02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:17.000
Loved Tomb Raider

02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:19.000
Didn't get a chance to play Deus Ex Human Revolution

02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:21.000
You should download it quickly because it is

02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:23.000
free on the PlayStation Network right now

02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:25.000
Oh is it?

02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:27.000
Thanks for the tip

02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:29.000
And Hitman is one they just added too

02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:31.000
I watched, I think it was TimTrip was playing Hitman

02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:33.000
The new one and it looked pretty neat

02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:35.000
It looked like a game I would be terrible at

02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:37.000
And Jet Set Radio is on there free as well

02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:39.000
Good lord

02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:41.000
I was downloading Hitman today

02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:43.000
I'm playing Dota 2 right now

02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:45.000
I suck at it but I like it

02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:47.000
I know you Rob have been playing it

02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:49.000
What do you think about the learning curve of the game

02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:51.000
Are you having as much trouble as me?

02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:53.000
Keep up the good work love you guys

02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:55.000
Thank you Travis

02:11:55.000 --> 02:11:57.000
Yes I am having as much trouble as you

02:11:57.000 --> 02:11:59.000
You just have to jump in there and do it

02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:01.000
I think that's the only way

02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:03.000
The good news is Dota 2 has a very robust

02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:05.000
tutorial system

02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:07.000
Don't be afraid to do the single lane match

02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:09.000
I really learned

02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:11.000
I do not like playing melee classes

02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:13.000
But I like playing

02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:15.000
ranged classes

02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:17.000
One of the ones I really liked was The Lich

02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:19.000
Because it's basically a parody of

02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:21.000
Arnold Schwarzenegger and Batman and Robin

02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:23.000
Chill out

02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:25.000
Everybody freeze

02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:27.000
The Lich is like that in Dota 2

02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:29.000
This is my new favorite character

02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:31.000
So check that out

02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:33.000
Alright there it is

02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:35.000
The end of Ask Orange Lounge

02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:37.000
But lots of good questions

02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:39.000
How could we not do that

02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:41.000
Alright let's do some stories

02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:43.000
Mailbag a few of the week coming up

02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:45.000
Twitter topics and the skype line

02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:47.000
But we have some news first

02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:49.000
Ok so there's a quick comparison

02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:51.000
Because we've gotten some information about

02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:53.000
The DVR function

02:12:53.000 --> 02:12:55.000
Of those

02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:57.000
Different next gen consoles

02:12:57.000 --> 02:12:59.000
So first off

02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:01.000
Game DVR

02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:03.000
For the Xbox One

02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:05.000
There was a Q&A section

02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:07.000
I had to laugh

02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:09.000
So IGN did this

02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:11.000
Ask Microsoft

02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:13.000
An AMA thing that they have on

02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:15.000
Reddit and stuff

02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:17.000
Except that none of the people that

02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:19.000
You know

02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:21.000
I'm bringing you a handful of Ask Microsoft

02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:23.000
Anything answers each Monday at 2pm

02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:25.000
Blah blah blah

02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:27.000
But the people that

02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:29.000
Participated on IGN didn't get the fucking

02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:31.000
Answer any of those questions

02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:33.000
It was all shit from IGN

02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:35.000
Probably you know

02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:37.000
Stuff that Microsoft said

02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:39.000
Ok here's what we're gonna give you answers for

02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:41.000
So anyways so one of those things

02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:43.000
About you know

02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:45.000
The game capture stuff they're saying

02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:47.000
Well fours of five clips capture 1080p

02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:49.000
And 60 frames per second and you know

02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:51.000
Where can game DVR clips be uploaded to

02:13:51.000 --> 02:13:53.000
And they're saying game DVR clips

02:13:53.000 --> 02:13:55.000
Capture beautiful 720p

02:13:55.000 --> 02:13:57.000
30 frames per second

02:13:57.000 --> 02:13:59.000
Video and I believe it's up to

02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:01.000
Five minutes if that was correct

02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:03.000
One of the things that kind of sucks

02:14:03.000 --> 02:14:05.000
Though is you have to have Xbox Live Gold

02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:07.000
In order to use that feature

02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:09.000
So they're locking it behind a paywall

02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:11.000
And of course

02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:13.000
In typical simly fashion

02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:15.000
As of late

02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:17.000
They responded back on Twitter

02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:19.000
And this is from

02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:21.000
Shuhei Yoshida

02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:23.000
Basically

02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:25.000
Saying that hey guess what

02:14:25.000 --> 02:14:27.000
The Playstation 4

02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:29.000
DVR function will record

02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:31.000
Up to 15 minutes of gameplay

02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:33.000
In the background and won't be

02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:35.000
Behind a paywall you do not need Playstation

02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:37.000
Plus in order to access

02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:39.000
The game recordings or streaming functionality

02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:41.000
So

02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:43.000
Cool

02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:45.000
I honestly don't think this is that big a deal

02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:47.000
It's not a huge deal

02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:49.000
I mean especially since you know if you're gonna be

02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:51.000
Capturing video and stuff you probably

02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:53.000
Want to upload it but there

02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:55.000
You probably have your own set of equipment too

02:14:55.000 --> 02:14:57.000
If you're really serious about it

02:14:57.000 --> 02:14:59.000
I understand that but the thing was is they were

02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:01.000
Basically saying well it's behind a paywall because

02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:03.000
You know you need to upload it to the cloud

02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:05.000
Or something like that but if you're uploading a clip

02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:07.000
To YouTube

02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:09.000
I don't understand I guess this is what it's doing

02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:11.000
It's capturing a video and it's uploading it to the cloud

02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:13.000
And then you edit it in the cloud then it gets forward to the YouTube

02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:15.000
It just seems like a really unnecessary process

02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:17.000
But whatever

02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:19.000
I mean

02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:21.000
I think a lot of people are gonna be getting the Xbox

02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:23.000
One probably already have

02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:25.000
Xbox Live Gold or

02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:27.000
Will be getting gold and also

02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:29.000
Now that you only have to have one account per family

02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:31.000
That has gold if you're gaming on one system

02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:33.000
That's not a huge deal but

02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:35.000
Still though it does kind of suck that there's

02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:37.000
Yet another feature behind a paywall

02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:39.000
Alright well Bungie has a

02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:41.000
New game coming out soon Destiny and of course

02:15:41.000 --> 02:15:43.000
Bungie was best known as the makers of the

02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:45.000
Halo series for quite some time

02:15:45.000 --> 02:15:47.000
And you know Halo isn't

02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:49.000
Always a game known for its best online

02:15:49.000 --> 02:15:51.000
Behavior and not only do you have the language

02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:53.000
That people use on things like Xbox Live

02:15:53.000 --> 02:15:55.000
But then of course you know teabagging

02:15:55.000 --> 02:15:57.000
Corpses and everything else that people do

02:15:57.000 --> 02:15:59.000
So Chris Butcher

02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:01.000
Who is a Bungie technical director was asked

02:16:01.000 --> 02:16:03.000
In an interview with Edge about

02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:05.000
How are you gonna address

02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:07.000
Some of these aggressive behaviors people have

02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:09.000
And he's mentioning that the developers

02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:11.000
Are talking about positive social behavior

02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:13.000
Rewarding in these games

02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:15.000
If you look back at online multiplayer

02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:17.000
Gaming for the last 10 years the dominant

02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:19.000
Thread has been adolescent males shooting each

02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:21.000
Other in the face and squatting on each other's

02:16:21.000 --> 02:16:23.000
Corpses at least they acknowledge it

02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:25.000
That emerges from design decisions

02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:27.000
The community gets attracted towards that

02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:29.000
And that is popular to a lot of other people

02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:31.000
And so it tends to exclude others

02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:33.000
What they're trying to do is they want to exclude

02:16:33.000 --> 02:16:35.000
Certain in game gestures

02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:37.000
And have the mapping of in game gestures

02:16:37.000 --> 02:16:39.000
Like waving and dancing to encourage

02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:41.000
More collaboration and friendliness

02:16:41.000 --> 02:16:43.000
Less posturing and aggression

02:16:43.000 --> 02:16:45.000
Here's the other quote

02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:52.000
You give people these tools that encourage

02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:54.000
Them to interact positively with each other

02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:56.000
And then if someone is interacting negatively

02:16:56.000 --> 02:16:58.000
With you well they can't ruin your

02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:00.000
Experience now they can just dance on your corpse

02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:02.000
I know it seems a little bit naive

02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:04.000
To me for a company that's you know did just

02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:06.000
That's just like trying to like say hey we're

02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:08.000
Giving you a game where you can draw things but we're gonna

02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:10.000
Band the dicks it's not gonna happen

02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:12.000
You're just not just

02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:14.000
Like if you if all you leave

02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:16.000
In is a little waving emote people

02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:18.000
Are gonna figure out how to fist each other

02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:20.000
Using the terrain

02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:22.000
That's what's gonna happen

02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:26.000
Come on

02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:28.000
But we'll see

02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:30.000
You underestimate their ability to

02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:32.000
Create lewd gestures

02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:34.000
But I do think rewarding good behavior is a good thing

02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:36.000
League of Legends does it and it feels pretty good

02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:38.000
When I get the little karma point after a match

02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:40.000
Because I was friendly to people

02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:42.000
I really wish WoW would implement a similar system

02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:44.000
So you know yeah it would be cool if they would reward

02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:46.000
The good behavior in Destiny but we'll see

02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:48.000
Where if someone gets killed by somebody else

02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:50.000
And they try to squad on them they get launched into space

02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:52.000
It would be funny

02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:54.000
That would be awesome

02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:56.000
And then people would do it on purpose to see what happens

02:17:56.000 --> 02:17:58.000
That would be kind of like a rad mod like you should be able to

02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:00.000
Carry around like little enhancements and one of them

02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:02.000
Could be like a time bomb

02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:04.000
On your corpse so somebody tries to teabag you

02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:06.000
It sets off the bomb and they go flying that would be funny

02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:08.000
Anyway

02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:10.000
Dark Sakura

02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:12.000
Well in other news

02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:14.000
Apart from teabagging and exploding into space

02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:16.000
There's an ad

02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:18.000
That Target put out

02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:20.000
That shows the PS Vita

02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:22.000
Going for 200 bucks

02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:24.000
And

02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:26.000
Basically there hasn't been

02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:28.000
Like a big announcement on anything like that

02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:30.000
Sony didn't say anything

02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:32.000
But it's in a Target ad and they have to get it from somewhere

02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:34.000
Basically this was

02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:36.000
Shown on

02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:38.000
Blu-ray forums

02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:40.000
With them all being marked down to $199.99

02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:42.000
At Target beginning August 18th

02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:44.000
To August 24th

02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:46.000
But there's been no confirmation

02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:48.000
I mean this could have just been some sort of

02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:50.000
Photoshopping deal

02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:52.000
But looking at

02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:54.000
The image

02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:56.000
You can see bleed through from the other side

02:18:56.000 --> 02:18:58.000
For the ads on the other side

02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:00.000
Which is a lot

02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:02.000
More effort to put into photoshopping

02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:04.000
Than most people will do

02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:06.000
Also considering where it's coming from

02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:08.000
The Blu-ray forums they're just looking at Blu-ray

02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:10.000
Discounts and stuff like that

02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:12.000
Focusing on

02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:14.000
Gaming consoles

02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:16.000
I think if anything

02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:18.000
They're probably trying to clear out some inventory

02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:20.000
Move some of that product because they've been sitting on it for a while

02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:22.000
Yeah

02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:24.000
The first thing that I do when I see stuff like this

02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:26.000
Is make sure that it's not a Photoshop job

02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:28.000
Also

02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:30.000
There is a message

02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:32.000
From the article itself

02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:34.000
Saying that Inside Gaming Daily

02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:36.000
Reported speculation about

02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:38.000
Doing a $500

02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:40.000
Vita PS4 bundle

02:19:40.000 --> 02:19:42.000
Yeah I don't think they'd do that

02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:44.000
Like I said, speculation

02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:46.000
But it would kind of go in if they did decrease

02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:48.000
The cost of the PS Vita

02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:50.000
Then that would make it easier

02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:52.000
To bundle with the system

02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:54.000
For $499?

02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:56.000
Is that what they were saying?

02:19:56.000 --> 02:19:58.000
Well they were saying

02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:00.000
Yeah $500 bundle

02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:02.000
But again

02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:04.000
If you've got the system going up for $399

02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:06.000
And then you threw in a $100 Vita

02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:08.000
And it competes with

02:20:08.000 --> 02:20:10.000
Basically the

02:20:10.000 --> 02:20:12.000
Xbone

02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:14.000
You're actually getting a better deal

02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:16.000
With the Playstation

02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:18.000
It better come with a Lamborghini

02:20:18.000 --> 02:20:20.000
And a Virgin Galactic space flight

02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:22.000
And a trip to Dubai

02:20:22.000 --> 02:20:24.000
Maybe not

02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:26.000
I would rather have a system with a handheld system

02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:28.000
Than have to deal with the stupid Kinect bullshit

02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:30.000
Just saying

02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:32.000
It'd be nice if it was true

02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:34.000
I don't know if I'd want a $100

02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:36.000
Space flight

02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:38.000
That sounds kind of dangerous

02:20:38.000 --> 02:20:40.000
So Nintendo is fighting piracy

02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:42.000
And this is actually more of like

02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:44.000
Legit piracy

02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:46.000
This is coming from

02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:48.000
A website

02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:50.000
Wait wait wait

02:20:50.000 --> 02:20:52.000
What is legit piracy?

02:20:52.000 --> 02:20:54.000
Like making physical goods

02:20:54.000 --> 02:20:56.000
Like

02:20:56.000 --> 02:20:58.000
Duplicating physical goods

02:20:58.000 --> 02:21:00.000
For example

02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:02.000
They filed a lawsuit against

02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:04.000
Hackyourconsole.com

02:21:04.000 --> 02:21:06.000
Other than selling the R4 device

02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:08.000
And similar things

02:21:08.000 --> 02:21:10.000
They also happen to sell hard drives

02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:12.000
That are preloaded with 200 Wii games

02:21:12.000 --> 02:21:14.000
Hmm that sounds a

02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:16.000
Bit bad

02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:18.000
That's pretty clear cut there

02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:20.000
They've lawsuit against them

02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:22.000
And most likely

02:21:22.000 --> 02:21:24.000
They're probably going to win

02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:26.000
That's pretty clear cut

02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:28.000
If they were just selling the R4 devices

02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:30.000
I'd say that they may have

02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:32.000
A little bit of a fight ahead of them

02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:34.000
But selling actual

02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:36.000
You know

02:21:36.000 --> 02:21:38.000
Hard drives that are full

02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:40.000
Of

02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:42.000
Games that's kind of bad

02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:46.000
Alright

02:21:46.000 --> 02:21:48.000
Well I don't know what else to say about that

02:21:48.000 --> 02:21:50.000
I mean if you're doing some bad stuff

02:21:50.000 --> 02:21:52.000
You're going to get shut down eventually

02:21:52.000 --> 02:21:54.000
There's really no arguing that right?

02:21:54.000 --> 02:21:56.000
Yeah it looks like actually they've removed

02:21:56.000 --> 02:21:58.000
The modded Wii consoles off their site

02:21:58.000 --> 02:22:00.000
All right well

02:22:00.000 --> 02:22:02.000
Moving on to talk about

02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:04.000
Street Fighter 5

02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:06.000
Nothing's been announced

02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:08.000
Don't get too excited

02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:10.000
After all we still have Ultra Street Fighter 4

02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:12.000
To get through

02:22:12.000 --> 02:22:14.000
There's at least a dozen more adjectives they can slap on to 4

02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:16.000
Well you're going to have

02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:18.000
Alina, Rolento, Hugo

02:22:18.000 --> 02:22:20.000
Poison and who knows who else

02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:22.000
Coming to Ultra Street Fighter 4

02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:24.000
But here's the thing

02:22:24.000 --> 02:22:26.000
According to one of the producers at Capcom

02:22:26.000 --> 02:22:28.000
Jackie Ayano says that

02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:30.000
Users do not need to worry because

02:22:30.000 --> 02:22:32.000
The characters will definitely not be just copy and pasted

02:22:32.000 --> 02:22:34.000
For Street Fighter X Tekken

02:22:34.000 --> 02:22:36.000
If we did that they would undoubtedly be the strongest characters

02:22:36.000 --> 02:22:38.000
In the game so

02:22:38.000 --> 02:22:40.000
These characters will be redone for Ultra Street Fighter 4

02:22:40.000 --> 02:22:42.000
But what happens next?

02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:44.000
Well

02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:46.000
It took 6 years to go from Street Fighter 2

02:22:46.000 --> 02:22:48.000
To Street Fighter 3

02:22:48.000 --> 02:22:50.000
And 9 years to go from Street Fighter 3 to Street Fighter 4

02:22:50.000 --> 02:22:52.000
So it would probably take us until

02:22:52.000 --> 02:22:54.000
The year 2018

02:22:54.000 --> 02:22:56.000
Before Street Fighter 5 comes out

02:22:56.000 --> 02:22:58.000
So yes no Street Fighter 5 until 2018

02:22:58.000 --> 02:23:00.000
But look forward to

02:23:00.000 --> 02:23:02.000
Insert adjective here Street Fighter 4

02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:04.000
Each and every year until then

02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:06.000
Single adjective please

02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:08.000
In 2018 I'll be turning 40

02:23:08.000 --> 02:23:10.000
And that makes me sad

02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:12.000
And you'll be 42

02:23:12.000 --> 02:23:14.000
40 also

02:23:14.000 --> 02:23:16.000
Not 42

02:23:16.000 --> 02:23:18.000
But at least we'll have Street Fighter 5

02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:20.000
At our birthday party to celebrate

02:23:20.000 --> 02:23:22.000
You can both be quiet

02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:24.000
I have 3 years for that shit

02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:26.000
That's right you forgot 40

02:23:26.000 --> 02:23:28.000
And amazing

02:23:28.000 --> 02:23:30.000
Anyhow can you believe we started

02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:32.000
This show and I was what like

02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:34.000
23 or having my 24th birthday

02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:36.000
And

02:23:36.000 --> 02:23:38.000
Now we're getting old as the show's getting old

02:23:38.000 --> 02:23:40.000
We'll probably still be doing OLR

02:23:40.000 --> 02:23:42.000
Hey kids

02:23:42.000 --> 02:23:44.000
50 come hey kids come

02:23:44.000 --> 02:23:46.000
Listen to our super cool show about games

02:23:46.000 --> 02:23:48.000
Oh but then again all you guys

02:23:48.000 --> 02:23:50.000
I tried to play this Kinect shit and broke

02:23:50.000 --> 02:23:52.000
My hip all you guys listening you're all

02:23:52.000 --> 02:23:54.000
Getting older too so

02:23:56.000 --> 02:23:58.000
We do have listeners that are older than us

02:23:58.000 --> 02:24:00.000
Yeah you guys will all be like 30

02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:04.000
My 30's are awesome

02:24:04.000 --> 02:24:06.000
For the record

02:24:06.000 --> 02:24:08.000
Alright let's get to the mailbag

02:24:08.000 --> 02:24:10.000
Speaking of our listeners we love to hear from our listeners

02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:12.000
I mean yeah we do

02:24:12.000 --> 02:24:14.000
Shut up of course we do we love to hear from our listeners

02:24:14.000 --> 02:24:16.000
Every week and you can

02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:18.000
Email us mailbag at

02:24:18.000 --> 02:24:20.000
Plowandtrader.com

02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:22.000
DarkSakura will be peer pressured into reading her

02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:24.000
Favorite emails here on the show

02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:28.000
Read the emails

02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:30.000
God dang Rob

02:24:30.000 --> 02:24:32.000
Hi all Ragenator here

02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:34.000
Here's a last second short random question

02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:36.000
What is the worst game each of you have played

02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:38.000
And what qualifies said games as being the worst

02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:40.000
I can tell you one that was so bad

02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:42.000
That Dan and I took it back to a

02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:44.000
Botbuster and requested a refund

02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:46.000
That was like some

02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:48.000
wrestling game it was thunder like WCW

02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:50.000
Thunder

02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:52.000
This is when we were on a really big wrestling kick

02:24:52.000 --> 02:24:54.000
And it was just bad

02:24:54.000 --> 02:24:56.000
We were like what the hell is this

02:24:56.000 --> 02:24:58.000
And also Spice World

02:24:58.000 --> 02:25:00.000
Fusion Frenzy 2 is the worst

02:25:00.000 --> 02:25:02.000
Game in recent memory that I've played

02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:04.000
It was so fucking bad

02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:08.000
Yaris

02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:10.000
That was gonna be my answer

02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:12.000
Me too me too

02:25:12.000 --> 02:25:14.000
Alright that's it

02:25:14.000 --> 02:25:16.000
So short

02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:18.000
God this is long

02:25:18.000 --> 02:25:20.000
With links to YouTube that I am not

02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:22.000
Going to address because first of all

02:25:22.000 --> 02:25:24.000
Can't watch YouTube on my iPad

02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:26.000
Thank you

02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:28.000
You can watch YouTube on your iPad

02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:30.000
Yes I can but not during the show

02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:32.000
Alright just to be clear

02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:34.000
Stop it

02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:36.000
Greetings OLR

02:25:36.000 --> 02:25:38.000
First off I hope you guys enjoyed your week off

02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:40.000
I might have if I still had a job

02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:42.000
I know we can all use one

02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:44.000
Anyway I thought I'd share some thoughts about

02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:46.000
Phil Fish's recent childish outburst

02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:48.000
First of all I'm greatly disappointed that you

02:25:48.000 --> 02:25:50.000
Guys improperly present Marcus

02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:52.000
Beer's complaint

02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:54.000
At least to me he seemed more angry than Phil Fish

02:25:54.000 --> 02:25:56.000
And Jonathan Blow were acting

02:25:56.000 --> 02:25:58.000
As though being asked questions

02:25:58.000 --> 02:26:00.000
Was some sort of unreasonable burden

02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:02.000
In case you haven't linked

02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:04.000
I'd certainly love to see what Phil Fish

02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:06.000
And Jonathan Blow said to Game Informer leading up

02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:08.000
To this however with only Marcus's

02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:10.000
Initial rant and Fish's immature response

02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:12.000
It just looks like a lot of grief could have

02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:14.000
Been saved with more

02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:16.000
Boilerplate non-committal response

02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:18.000
Which leads me to my position

02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:20.000
Phil Fish cancelled Fez 2 and is

02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:22.000
Leaving the game industry just because a few people

02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:24.000
Called out his condescending nonsense

02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:26.000
Seriously?

02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:28.000
I'm some

02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:30.000
Insignificant twit in Miami who gets

02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:32.000
Worse every time he sends an email to the show

02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:34.000
Saying something someone doesn't like

02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:36.000
But do you see me pitching my skirt and running away?

02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:38.000
No

02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:40.000
The only reason I haven't sent an email lately

02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:42.000
Is because I've not had anything to say before this

02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:46.000
You ask me Marcus is 100% right on this

02:26:46.000 --> 02:26:48.000
If you don't have anything to say

02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:50.000
Or you're looking for a confirmation

02:26:50.000 --> 02:26:52.000
You can say so

02:26:52.000 --> 02:26:54.000
You can give a rote

02:26:54.000 --> 02:26:56.000
We do not comment on rumors and speculation

02:26:56.000 --> 02:26:58.000
If you like

02:26:58.000 --> 02:27:00.000
However unless you're going to do a massive TV and radio advertisement

02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:02.000
Carpet bombing

02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:04.000
It's not a good idea to treat the press like

02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:06.000
They're the worst thing that's ever existed

02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:08.000
If they're not asking anything personal

02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:10.000
Or trying to create controversy for page hits

02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:12.000
Then treat them with the measure of respect

02:27:12.000 --> 02:27:14.000
That you want them to treat you

02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:16.000
Or more importantly your game

02:27:16.000 --> 02:27:18.000
Honestly I hope the press takes

02:27:18.000 --> 02:27:20.000
Marcus Spears advice

02:27:20.000 --> 02:27:22.000
I hope Blow and Fish

02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:24.000
Have trouble for the rest of their careers

02:27:24.000 --> 02:27:26.000
Finding press who want to endure

02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:28.000
Their nonsensical whining

02:27:28.000 --> 02:27:30.000
Because that's the only thing that hostile

02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:32.000
That hostile assholes deserve

02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:34.000
Unfortunately I know that Fish will come back

02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:36.000
To kickstarter for Fez 2

02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:38.000
And get his goal times a billion

02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:40.000
Because most gamers stop thinking for themselves

02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:42.000
When words like innovation and independent

02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:44.000
Are thrown about

02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:46.000
This is of course while many other developers

02:27:46.000 --> 02:27:48.000
In the air know struggle to gain any attention at all

02:27:48.000 --> 02:27:50.000
There truly is no justice in the world

02:27:50.000 --> 02:27:52.000
Anyway

02:27:52.000 --> 02:27:54.000
Quick question now, thank you

02:27:54.000 --> 02:27:56.000
I had a quick question unrelated to this nonsense

02:27:56.000 --> 02:27:58.000
Recently Giant Bomb had a quick look

02:27:58.000 --> 02:28:00.000
Of Dynasty Warriors 8

02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:02.000
In which the only bit of information that could be gleaned

02:28:02.000 --> 02:28:04.000
They looked at it was that the Xbox 360 version

02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:06.000
Was a poorly done port

02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:08.000
Why was there so little information

02:28:08.000 --> 02:28:10.000
For such a long video

02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:12.000
Because Jeff and Vinny were devoted to hammering

02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:14.000
The hit X joke into the ground

02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:16.000
And whining about how they hated the series as a whole

02:28:16.000 --> 02:28:18.000
Anyway I've never played

02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:20.000
A Musou game before and was mainly

02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:22.000
Scared off of them as it seems many of the media

02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:24.000
Outlets I frequent have the same attitude

02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:26.000
Of dismissing the games at first glance

02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:28.000
Then you need to re-destruct

02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:30.000
Doid and Jim Sterling

02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:32.000
See some people

02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:34.000
Sorry to interrupt but some people

02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:36.000
Are here for that and I think either you're

02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:38.000
Kind of like a fan of those types of games

02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:40.000
Some people get great pleasure

02:28:40.000 --> 02:28:42.000
Out of button mashing X and kill kill kill

02:28:42.000 --> 02:28:44.000
Die die die

02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:46.000
See that's the thing with reviewers

02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:48.000
You can't just take some anonymous reviewers

02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:50.000
Opinion for it, you gotta look at what they like

02:28:50.000 --> 02:28:52.000
And if they like similar games

02:28:52.000 --> 02:28:54.000
That you like then that's the reviewer

02:28:54.000 --> 02:28:56.000
You follow as far as whether

02:28:56.000 --> 02:28:58.000
You may like something that

02:28:58.000 --> 02:29:00.000
If they like that genre of game

02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:02.000
Then yes that would probably be

02:29:02.000 --> 02:29:04.000
One that you wanna, if they say it's truly bad

02:29:04.000 --> 02:29:06.000
Then you know

02:29:06.000 --> 02:29:08.000
I get really stressed out and irritated too

02:29:08.000 --> 02:29:10.000
When I hear these big media outlets

02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:12.000
Talking about things that they don't know a lick about

02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:14.000
Like you know I think a great example

02:29:14.000 --> 02:29:16.000
Going back to X-Play

02:29:16.000 --> 02:29:18.000
When they talked about how Beatmania on the Playstation 2

02:29:18.000 --> 02:29:20.000
Was a rip off of Guitar Hero

02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:22.000
I was like um

02:29:22.000 --> 02:29:24.000
Um no

02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:26.000
But then I have to remember

02:29:26.000 --> 02:29:28.000
I don't really give a shit what X-Play thinks

02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:30.000
You know and I don't really base my decisions

02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:32.000
Off that show

02:29:32.000 --> 02:29:34.000
So I have to find the reviewer that best matches me

02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:36.000
And you say a lot

02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:38.000
With your voice when you tune out

02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:40.000
Yeah but if you don't look at multiple sources

02:29:40.000 --> 02:29:42.000
You may miss something

02:29:42.000 --> 02:29:44.000
I'm not saying focus necessarily on just one

02:29:44.000 --> 02:29:46.000
But you do have to kinda

02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:48.000
You have to find those that kinda mesh well with your taste

02:29:48.000 --> 02:29:50.000
I think like Loki said

02:29:50.000 --> 02:29:52.000
I don't know much about these Jim Sterling reviews

02:29:52.000 --> 02:29:54.000
But it sounds like if he's more of a fan of these

02:29:54.000 --> 02:29:56.000
It's counter balanced to what you saw happen over on

02:29:56.000 --> 02:29:58.000
There's more in the email

02:29:58.000 --> 02:30:00.000
There's a lot more in the email

02:30:00.000 --> 02:30:02.000
However I read a blog defending the series

02:30:02.000 --> 02:30:04.000
And this was on Giant Bomb

02:30:04.000 --> 02:30:06.000
And was immediately struck by the passionate defense of the series

02:30:06.000 --> 02:30:08.000
And the blogger's reactions for loving it as he does

02:30:08.000 --> 02:30:10.000
Intrigued by the case he made

02:30:10.000 --> 02:30:12.000
I picked up Warriors Orochi 3 Hyper

02:30:12.000 --> 02:30:14.000
For Wii U

02:30:14.000 --> 02:30:16.000
As a sort of test for how I'd feel

02:30:16.000 --> 02:30:18.000
I ended up enjoying the game immensely

02:30:18.000 --> 02:30:20.000
And have since picked up Dynasty Warriors 8 for the PS3

02:30:20.000 --> 02:30:22.000
And the original Warriors Orochi for 360

02:30:22.000 --> 02:30:24.000
In addition to importing the PS3 version

02:30:24.000 --> 02:30:26.000
Of Dynasty Warriors 7 Empires

02:30:26.000 --> 02:30:28.000
I think about this now

02:30:28.000 --> 02:30:30.000
Against the current backdrop of people passionately tearing

02:30:30.000 --> 02:30:32.000
Apart reviewers for having a less than positive

02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:34.000
Opinion of Dragon's Crown to the point where

02:30:34.000 --> 02:30:36.000
Atlas had to defend controversial reviews

02:30:36.000 --> 02:30:38.000
By the way

02:30:38.000 --> 02:30:40.000
My problem with Dragon Crown is just

02:30:40.000 --> 02:30:42.000
The

02:30:42.000 --> 02:30:44.000
I love and hate the art style in that game

02:30:44.000 --> 02:30:46.000
And that's really what I hate

02:30:46.000 --> 02:30:48.000
Did you see the minigame where the girl's chained up

02:30:48.000 --> 02:30:50.000
And you can touch her and she squirms?

02:30:50.000 --> 02:30:52.000
Yeah, I hate that

02:30:52.000 --> 02:30:54.000
Anyway, going onward

02:30:54.000 --> 02:30:56.000
While I don't like the game either

02:30:56.000 --> 02:30:58.000
After having played it

02:30:58.000 --> 02:31:00.000
I can safely assume that were I on the fence

02:31:00.000 --> 02:31:02.000
Controversial ranting

02:31:02.000 --> 02:31:04.000
We're seeing now would not have driven me

02:31:04.000 --> 02:31:06.000
To try the way the game

02:31:06.000 --> 02:31:08.000
The way the impassioned

02:31:08.000 --> 02:31:10.000
Immature defense of Dynasty Warriors

02:31:10.000 --> 02:31:12.000
I mentioned earlier had moved me

02:31:12.000 --> 02:31:14.000
With that in mind, here's my inquiry

02:31:14.000 --> 02:31:16.000
I thought it was a short question

02:31:16.000 --> 02:31:18.000
Okay

02:31:18.000 --> 02:31:20.000
I'm sorry RossoUT

02:31:20.000 --> 02:31:22.000
I actually really like your emails because of how well

02:31:22.000 --> 02:31:24.000
Written they are and just how well you lay out

02:31:24.000 --> 02:31:26.000
Your ideas

02:31:26.000 --> 02:31:28.000
You know what, I do appreciate that

02:31:28.000 --> 02:31:30.000
He does come back when he's got something to say

02:31:30.000 --> 02:31:32.000
Yes

02:31:32.000 --> 02:31:34.000
With that in mind, here's my inquiry

02:31:34.000 --> 02:31:36.000
Uh oh, I need to make sure I don't get out of chat

02:31:36.000 --> 02:31:38.000
Okay

02:31:38.000 --> 02:31:40.000
First, why does defending

02:31:40.000 --> 02:31:42.000
Something often turn into attacks on disagreeing

02:31:42.000 --> 02:31:44.000
Reviewers despite it being counterproductive

02:31:44.000 --> 02:31:46.000
To the apparent goal of winning

02:31:46.000 --> 02:31:48.000
Over the indecisive

02:31:48.000 --> 02:31:50.000
Well to go on that first, I mean look at freaking politics

02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:52.000
Oh god yes

02:31:52.000 --> 02:31:54.000
I think that's more human, that's not something specific to gaming

02:31:54.000 --> 02:31:56.000
That's human nature

02:31:56.000 --> 02:31:58.000
Yeah that's human nature, my way or the highway

02:31:58.000 --> 02:32:00.000
And as I mentioned in part A, people actually do get a positive

02:32:00.000 --> 02:32:02.000
Chemical response from having other people agree with them

02:32:02.000 --> 02:32:04.000
And by presenting

02:32:04.000 --> 02:32:06.000
Their own information

02:32:06.000 --> 02:32:08.000
It is

02:32:08.000 --> 02:32:10.000
I think it's a dopamine response

02:32:10.000 --> 02:32:12.000
Where if you, people actually feel better

02:32:12.000 --> 02:32:14.000
Attacking something that's outside

02:32:15.000 --> 02:32:17.000
It feels good to be validated and affirmated

02:32:17.000 --> 02:32:19.000
Get out

02:32:19.000 --> 02:32:21.000
I understand

02:32:21.000 --> 02:32:23.000
But for some people they actually take that

02:32:23.000 --> 02:32:25.000
Aggression side of it and get kind of an adrenaline

02:32:25.000 --> 02:32:27.000
Rush off of it

02:32:27.000 --> 02:32:29.000
You know, you get into that

02:32:29.000 --> 02:32:31.000
Especially the more passionate you feel about something

02:32:31.000 --> 02:32:33.000
You stop really caring about what other people think

02:32:33.000 --> 02:32:35.000
Your idea or nothing

02:32:35.000 --> 02:32:37.000
And you do get an emotional rush out of it

02:32:37.000 --> 02:32:39.000
So it really is just basic

02:32:39.000 --> 02:32:41.000
Biochemistry and psychology

02:32:41.000 --> 02:32:43.000
Anybody else?

02:32:43.000 --> 02:32:45.000
Want to expand?

02:32:45.000 --> 02:32:47.000
Nah go ahead because I know there's at least a couple more

02:32:47.000 --> 02:32:49.000
Second, have you ever been moved by an

02:32:49.000 --> 02:32:51.000
Unpopular games defenders to give said game

02:32:51.000 --> 02:32:53.000
A chance?

02:32:53.000 --> 02:32:55.000
Mass Effect

02:32:55.000 --> 02:32:57.000
Yeah Mass Effect is a good example

02:32:57.000 --> 02:32:59.000
And it wasn't unpopular but a lot of people

02:32:59.000 --> 02:33:01.000
I wasn't going to give it a chance

02:33:01.000 --> 02:33:03.000
Well at the time, remember we got into it right when

02:33:03.000 --> 02:33:05.000
Mass Effect 3 had first come out

02:33:05.000 --> 02:33:07.000
There was all that ending wank

02:33:07.000 --> 02:33:09.000
So I don't know about the unpopular part

02:33:09.000 --> 02:33:11.000
Well god even just this week

02:33:11.000 --> 02:33:13.000
I gave Team Fortress 2 a try

02:33:13.000 --> 02:33:15.000
I didn't think I'd like it but Act Deaf was like

02:33:15.000 --> 02:33:17.000
No you gotta try, you gotta try

02:33:17.000 --> 02:33:19.000
I think it's a massively unpopular game

02:33:19.000 --> 02:33:21.000
Yeah that's true, I guess Team Fortress isn't really unpopular either

02:33:21.000 --> 02:33:23.000
Well god, what about the music games

02:33:23.000 --> 02:33:25.000
We used to play for years

02:33:25.000 --> 02:33:27.000
I don't think those cracked into the mainstream

02:33:27.000 --> 02:33:29.000
Well and I actually liked Kraken DJ

02:33:29.000 --> 02:33:31.000
For a while, I thought that was fun

02:33:31.000 --> 02:33:33.000
And a lot of people were like yeah

02:33:33.000 --> 02:33:35.000
Um

02:33:35.000 --> 02:33:37.000
I know that there were others because um

02:33:37.000 --> 02:33:39.000
Like some of the weirder treasure

02:33:39.000 --> 02:33:41.000
Games that people were kind of poo pooing on

02:33:41.000 --> 02:33:43.000
I thought were great, you know like, I liked Chameleon

02:33:43.000 --> 02:33:45.000
Twist, I liked uh

02:33:45.000 --> 02:33:47.000
Mischief Makers, those were fun games

02:33:47.000 --> 02:33:49.000
You know, anything?

02:33:51.000 --> 02:33:53.000
Okay, anyway keep up the good work

02:33:53.000 --> 02:33:55.000
Guys, I look forward to your response

02:33:55.000 --> 02:33:57.000
Regards, we're all still UT

02:33:57.000 --> 02:33:59.000
Alrighty, two more to go

02:33:59.000 --> 02:34:01.000
Alright, dearest denizens of

02:34:01.000 --> 02:34:03.000
Podcastopia

02:34:03.000 --> 02:34:05.000
So I got a summons for jury duty

02:34:05.000 --> 02:34:07.000
For next week, I'm sorry

02:34:07.000 --> 02:34:09.000
I didn't know on what day this week

02:34:09.000 --> 02:34:11.000
I will have to drag my happy ass out of bed

02:34:11.000 --> 02:34:13.000
To be at the courthouse at 8am to do my civic duty

02:34:13.000 --> 02:34:15.000
But I do know that day is

02:34:15.000 --> 02:34:17.000
Not Monday, this gives me at least one

02:34:17.000 --> 02:34:19.000
Day to download a game off PSN

02:34:19.000 --> 02:34:21.000
To play on my Vita

02:34:21.000 --> 02:34:23.000
What should I get? Preferably

02:34:23.000 --> 02:34:25.000
I'd like something that won't make a lot of noise

02:34:25.000 --> 02:34:27.000
But will require me to make a lot of

02:34:27.000 --> 02:34:29.000
Movements that look vaguely threatening to old people

02:34:29.000 --> 02:34:31.000
Stay black, redertainment

02:34:31.000 --> 02:34:33.000
Trainer

02:34:33.000 --> 02:34:35.000
Uh

02:34:35.000 --> 02:34:37.000
Gaming during jury duty is

02:34:37.000 --> 02:34:39.000
There is going to be long periods of waiting

02:34:39.000 --> 02:34:41.000
You know what?

02:34:41.000 --> 02:34:43.000
You know the Sacramento courthouse that make you turn off all your devices

02:34:43.000 --> 02:34:45.000
What? When you're in

02:34:45.000 --> 02:34:47.000
Oh, when you're in the room, when you're in the

02:34:47.000 --> 02:34:49.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, but I mean like while you're waiting

02:34:49.000 --> 02:34:51.000
In the jury hall, while you're waiting in the hallway

02:34:51.000 --> 02:34:53.000
I have always spent more time

02:34:53.000 --> 02:34:55.000
In the stupid jury selection

02:34:55.000 --> 02:34:57.000
Than I have ever in the lines

02:34:57.000 --> 02:34:59.000
So any suggestions

02:34:59.000 --> 02:35:01.000
For Vita games that make you look

02:35:01.000 --> 02:35:03.000
Vaguely spasmodic?

02:35:05.000 --> 02:35:07.000
Not that don't involve Kinect

02:35:07.000 --> 02:35:09.000
Katamari!

02:35:09.000 --> 02:35:11.000
Um, Little Big Planet?

02:35:11.000 --> 02:35:13.000
Maybe

02:35:13.000 --> 02:35:15.000
Or I

02:35:15.000 --> 02:35:17.000
I can't recommend this because

02:35:17.000 --> 02:35:19.000
The game is bad, but a fighting game

02:35:19.000 --> 02:35:21.000
Involves in there's

02:35:21.000 --> 02:35:23.000
Cap Comics Tekken

02:35:23.000 --> 02:35:25.000
So that'll be

02:35:25.000 --> 02:35:27.000
Mashing the buttons and looking mean

02:35:27.000 --> 02:35:29.000
Yeah

02:35:29.000 --> 02:35:31.000
I definitely see looks of frustration

02:35:31.000 --> 02:35:33.000
In playing that, so that makes sense

02:35:33.000 --> 02:35:35.000
So we do have one last email

02:35:35.000 --> 02:35:37.000
Hey OLR crew

02:35:37.000 --> 02:35:39.000
AZHP here

02:35:39.000 --> 02:35:41.000
I never asked, is it AZHP or AZHP?

02:35:41.000 --> 02:35:43.000
I think it's AZHP

02:35:43.000 --> 02:35:45.000
I thought the HP was Harry Potter

02:35:45.000 --> 02:35:47.000
Okay

02:35:47.000 --> 02:35:49.000
Last week I went to a convention

02:35:49.000 --> 02:35:51.000
Co-founded by a good friend of mine called

02:35:51.000 --> 02:35:53.000
GamerX

02:35:53.000 --> 02:35:55.000
My girlfriend cosplayed as Zelda

02:35:55.000 --> 02:35:57.000
Which as anime fans is the most mainstream

02:35:57.000 --> 02:35:59.000
Game cosplay she had

02:35:59.000 --> 02:36:01.000
I wanted to write in to say

02:36:01.000 --> 02:36:03.000
She had a super positive experience

02:36:03.000 --> 02:36:05.000
Even as a completely straight couple

02:36:05.000 --> 02:36:07.000
Everyone who wanted a picture with her was super enthusiastic

02:36:07.000 --> 02:36:09.000
And didn't give off the typical creeper vibe

02:36:09.000 --> 02:36:11.000
That comes with most convention goers

02:36:11.000 --> 02:36:13.000
When they said

02:36:13.000 --> 02:36:15.000
I love your costume, it's amazing

02:36:15.000 --> 02:36:17.000
She didn't feel like they were trying to hit on her

02:36:17.000 --> 02:36:19.000
And genuinely enjoyed her costume

02:36:19.000 --> 02:36:21.000
Even though we didn't go to many of the panels

02:36:21.000 --> 02:36:23.000
And the dealer's hall was clearly geared toward

02:36:23.000 --> 02:36:25.000
The LGBT crowd

02:36:25.000 --> 02:36:27.000
The vibe we got from the convention was super positive

02:36:27.000 --> 02:36:29.000
The game room was lots of fun

02:36:29.000 --> 02:36:31.000
The Japanese version of Project Diva F

02:36:31.000 --> 02:36:33.000
The Saturn version of Puzzle Bobble

02:36:33.000 --> 02:36:35.000
And Typing of the Dead on Dreamcast

02:36:35.000 --> 02:36:37.000
I was actually surprised

02:36:37.000 --> 02:36:39.000
There weren't that many furries at the convention

02:36:39.000 --> 02:36:41.000
Given that I know a lot of gamers are also

02:36:41.000 --> 02:36:43.000
Furries

02:36:43.000 --> 02:36:45.000
There were a couple, because they were even advertising a furry con

02:36:45.000 --> 02:36:47.000
That's coming up, had one of the booths

02:36:47.000 --> 02:36:49.000
So, you know, hey, whatever you like

02:36:49.000 --> 02:36:51.000
As long as it's, you know, consensual

02:36:51.000 --> 02:36:53.000
I unfortunately wasn't able to stay

02:36:53.000 --> 02:36:55.000
Late enough to catch the podcast panel

02:36:55.000 --> 02:36:57.000
I definitely regret

02:36:57.000 --> 02:36:59.000
Missing my chance to say hi to Rob

02:36:59.000 --> 02:37:01.000
Squinty face

02:37:01.000 --> 02:37:03.000
Anyway, I definitely recommend people check it out

02:37:03.000 --> 02:37:05.000
It's definitely a fun experience

02:37:05.000 --> 02:37:07.000
Well, definitely, lots of definitelys there

02:37:07.000 --> 02:37:09.000
Check it out again next year if it's in San Francisco again

02:37:09.000 --> 02:37:11.000
Yours truly is HP

02:37:11.000 --> 02:37:13.000
P.S. If you guys are interested

02:37:13.000 --> 02:37:15.000
Here's a picture of the Zelda costume my girlfriend wore

02:37:15.000 --> 02:37:17.000
I actually looked at the picture

02:37:17.000 --> 02:37:19.000
And I saw her

02:37:19.000 --> 02:37:21.000
Which must have been I saw you at some point

02:37:21.000 --> 02:37:23.000
And I was like

02:37:23.000 --> 02:37:25.000
Wow, that is fucking good

02:37:25.000 --> 02:37:27.000
Feel free to link in the chat

02:37:27.000 --> 02:37:29.000
I helped make the harp

02:37:29.000 --> 02:37:31.000
So it was cool hearing people compliment it at the convention

02:37:31.000 --> 02:37:33.000
So I'm pulling it up

02:37:33.000 --> 02:37:35.000
Very nice

02:37:35.000 --> 02:37:37.000
Yeah, it was very good

02:37:37.000 --> 02:37:39.000
Yeah, if you can put that in chat

02:37:39.000 --> 02:37:41.000
I'm sure the chatters would like to see that

02:37:41.000 --> 02:37:43.000
Very well done

02:37:43.000 --> 02:37:45.000
I saw her in the gaming room

02:37:45.000 --> 02:37:47.000
Playing one of the dancing games

02:37:47.000 --> 02:37:49.000
Alright, well I'm gonna copy this

02:37:49.000 --> 02:37:51.000
If I didn't actually close the window

02:37:51.000 --> 02:37:53.000
Alright, that's it for

02:37:53.000 --> 02:37:55.000
Emails tonight, right?

02:37:55.000 --> 02:37:57.000
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

02:37:57.000 --> 02:37:59.000
We're almost to 9 o'clock

02:37:59.000 --> 02:38:01.000
So let's try to jam through the rest of this pretty quick

02:38:01.000 --> 02:38:03.000
Because I do want to get in some calls

02:38:03.000 --> 02:38:05.000
So we're gonna go to the FUs

02:38:05.000 --> 02:38:07.000
Of the week

02:38:07.000 --> 02:38:23.000
Dark Sakura

02:38:23.000 --> 02:38:25.000
I was debating whether or not

02:38:25.000 --> 02:38:27.000
I wanted to say their name on air

02:38:27.000 --> 02:38:29.000
But I'm going to

02:38:29.000 --> 02:38:31.000
FU to Bonnie Plumbing Heating and Air

02:38:31.000 --> 02:38:35.000
For giving indications

02:38:35.000 --> 02:38:39.000
Of being the type of hypocritical conservative Christians

02:38:39.000 --> 02:38:41.000
That I personally do not like

02:38:41.000 --> 02:38:43.000
Allegedly

02:38:43.000 --> 02:38:45.000
Loki

02:38:45.000 --> 02:38:47.000
Oh, and my battery

02:38:47.000 --> 02:38:49.000
FU to my car

02:38:49.000 --> 02:38:51.000
I'm not really sure what it's doing

02:38:51.000 --> 02:38:53.000
But whenever I turn all the way to the right

02:38:53.000 --> 02:38:55.000
My radio shuts off

02:38:55.000 --> 02:38:57.000
That's weird

02:38:57.000 --> 02:38:59.000
That's a little creepy

02:38:59.000 --> 02:39:01.000
FU to this fucking con plague

02:39:01.000 --> 02:39:03.000
I've been carrying since Tuesday

02:39:03.000 --> 02:39:05.000
And FU to Extifer

02:39:05.000 --> 02:39:07.000
Who allegedly gave it to me

02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:09.000
Alan

02:39:09.000 --> 02:39:11.000
FU to the associated dental issues

02:39:11.000 --> 02:39:13.000
That someone can get when they're in their 30s

02:39:13.000 --> 02:39:15.000
And also FU to the fact that I think

02:39:15.000 --> 02:39:17.000
Sanrio chewed through

02:39:17.000 --> 02:39:19.000
The microphone portion cable

02:39:19.000 --> 02:39:21.000
Of my headset

02:39:21.000 --> 02:39:23.000
Though it doesn't look chewed

02:39:23.000 --> 02:39:25.000
It looks like someone just snipped it with scissors

02:39:25.000 --> 02:39:27.000
Because you know how a headset has the green

02:39:27.000 --> 02:39:29.000
And the red for the mic

02:39:29.000 --> 02:39:31.000
It forks off like a snake stone at the very end

02:39:32.000 --> 02:39:34.000
I wonder why she would have chewed that

02:39:34.000 --> 02:39:36.000
It's weird

02:39:36.000 --> 02:39:38.000
She's gonna have to buy a new headset

02:39:38.000 --> 02:39:40.000
It's like 40 bucks that I don't have

02:39:40.000 --> 02:39:42.000
Alright, there it is, you have to use the week

02:39:42.000 --> 02:39:44.000
Loki

02:39:44.000 --> 02:39:46.000
Alright, so more Xbox One news

02:39:46.000 --> 02:39:48.000
This is once again

02:39:48.000 --> 02:39:50.000
Something else that they've kind of changed their mind on

02:39:50.000 --> 02:39:52.000
And that was the whole inclusion

02:39:52.000 --> 02:39:54.000
Of a chat headset

02:39:54.000 --> 02:39:56.000
With the Xbox One

02:39:56.000 --> 02:39:58.000
Yes, the Xbox One

02:39:58.000 --> 02:40:00.000
Day one edition will come with a chat headset

02:40:00.000 --> 02:40:04.000
So it'll be very much like it was with the Xbox 360

02:40:04.000 --> 02:40:06.000
Originally, they were planning not to include one of those

02:40:06.000 --> 02:40:08.000
And you'd have to buy it separately

02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:10.000
So, good to know

02:40:10.000 --> 02:40:12.000
You're getting some more value for your $500

02:40:15.000 --> 02:40:18.000
Hooray! I guess a lot of people are very excited about that

02:40:18.000 --> 02:40:20.000
More value is good

02:40:20.000 --> 02:40:23.000
And also hooray, I want to end on a positive note tonight

02:40:23.000 --> 02:40:25.000
Because unfortunately a lot of times

02:40:25.000 --> 02:40:27.000
We have to talk about, you know, gaming studios

02:40:27.000 --> 02:40:29.000
That are closing

02:40:29.000 --> 02:40:31.000
And people that are out of a job

02:40:31.000 --> 02:40:33.000
But tonight we get to say hooray

02:40:33.000 --> 02:40:37.000
In Vancouver, Namco Bandai is opening a new office

02:40:37.000 --> 02:40:40.000
And it's gonna be dedicated to mobile and online titles

02:40:40.000 --> 02:40:43.000
But about 30 people working there in Vancouver

02:40:43.000 --> 02:40:45.000
Making these titles

02:40:45.000 --> 02:40:47.000
No word of course on what those games are

02:40:47.000 --> 02:40:49.000
But, yay

02:40:49.000 --> 02:40:51.000
And since this is a Namco story

02:40:51.000 --> 02:40:52.000
Can I say something real quick?

02:40:52.000 --> 02:40:53.000
Please do

02:40:53.000 --> 02:40:55.000
They're talking about this in chat

02:40:56.000 --> 02:40:59.000
Pac-Man Champion Edition DX is coming to Steam

02:40:59.000 --> 02:41:01.000
It's a DX Plus version

02:41:01.000 --> 02:41:03.000
Out of respect for Dark Sakura

02:41:03.000 --> 02:41:05.000
I will say I purchased early

02:41:05.000 --> 02:41:07.000
I purchased in advance

02:41:07.000 --> 02:41:09.000
I did not pre-purchase because that's not a thing

02:41:09.000 --> 02:41:11.000
I purchased early the game

02:41:11.000 --> 02:41:13.000
Oh, stop feeding her

02:41:13.000 --> 02:41:15.000
Alan is perfectly right

02:41:15.000 --> 02:41:17.000
If you purchase early

02:41:17.000 --> 02:41:19.000
Because it's not gonna be playable until September 24th

02:41:19.000 --> 02:41:21.000
And they took my $9.99

02:41:21.000 --> 02:41:23.000
So if you purchase early you'll get

02:41:23.000 --> 02:41:25.000
What I think is going to be a DLC pack

02:41:25.000 --> 02:41:27.000
It's extra songs, extra maps

02:41:27.000 --> 02:41:29.000
And you can play as the little Dig Dug avatar

02:41:29.000 --> 02:41:31.000
I thought some of that was supposed to be part of it anyway

02:41:31.000 --> 02:41:33.000
And a little race car avatar

02:41:33.000 --> 02:41:36.000
Well it says Act Def in chat pasted the Steam link

02:41:36.000 --> 02:41:38.000
And it'll say purchase now and you'll get all this crap

02:41:38.000 --> 02:41:43.000
So, new Pac-Man or Pac-Man DX is such an amazing game

02:41:43.000 --> 02:41:45.000
Yeah, it is a great Pac-Man game

02:41:45.000 --> 02:41:46.000
It's coming to Steam

02:41:46.000 --> 02:41:48.000
Alright, we're gonna open up the phones now

02:41:48.000 --> 02:41:50.000
It's that time, 1877 Game OLR

02:41:50.000 --> 02:41:52.000
Or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio

02:41:52.000 --> 02:41:54.000
If you want to give us a call

02:41:54.000 --> 02:41:56.000
And talk with us about anything we've talked about tonight

02:41:56.000 --> 02:41:58.000
Or maybe you have something that we didn't cover

02:41:58.000 --> 02:42:00.000
That you want to talk about

02:42:00.000 --> 02:42:02.000
But, there it is

02:42:02.000 --> 02:42:04.000
The phones are open

02:42:04.000 --> 02:42:06.000
1877 Game OLR or a username on Skype

02:42:06.000 --> 02:42:08.000
Orange Lounge Radio

02:42:08.000 --> 02:42:10.000
I saw at least one tweet come through that I want to get to

02:42:10.000 --> 02:42:12.000
Here quickly

02:42:12.000 --> 02:42:14.000
Otherwise, do we have any last minute stories?

02:42:14.000 --> 02:42:16.000
Loki, Dark Sakura?

02:42:16.000 --> 02:42:18.000
Yeah, I can talk real quick about

02:42:18.000 --> 02:42:20.000
They announced, well, I knew about them

02:42:20.000 --> 02:42:22.000
They announced the characters for the second wave

02:42:22.000 --> 02:42:24.000
Of Disney Infinity stuff

02:42:24.000 --> 02:42:26.000
That's going to be starting in October

02:42:26.000 --> 02:42:28.000
And those include such things as like the Wreck-It Ralph

02:42:28.000 --> 02:42:30.000
Characters, so you get Wreck-It Ralph

02:42:30.000 --> 02:42:32.000
They've got

02:42:32.000 --> 02:42:34.000
What else here?

02:42:34.000 --> 02:42:36.000
Of course, the Toy Story pack is going to be coming around

02:42:36.000 --> 02:42:38.000
At the same time as the Buzz Lightyear

02:42:38.000 --> 02:42:40.000
Jesse are going to be in the actual pack

02:42:40.000 --> 02:42:42.000
And then Woody is going to be sold separately

02:42:42.000 --> 02:42:44.000
They're going to have the Phineas and Furb

02:42:44.000 --> 02:42:46.000
Or Phineas and Agent P

02:42:46.000 --> 02:42:48.000
And then of course, like I said

02:42:48.000 --> 02:42:50.000
Ralph, Vanellope

02:42:50.000 --> 02:42:52.000
And then kind of some one-offs

02:42:52.000 --> 02:42:54.000
They have Rapunzel from Tangled

02:42:54.000 --> 02:42:56.000
Jack Skellington

02:42:56.000 --> 02:42:58.000
And, um

02:42:58.000 --> 02:43:00.000
Let me, I'm on Fantasia

02:43:00.000 --> 02:43:02.000
We actually have a call on the line

02:43:02.000 --> 02:43:04.000
You can probably hear the coffee in the background

02:43:04.000 --> 02:43:06.000
We have a call on the line

02:43:06.000 --> 02:43:08.000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

02:43:08.000 --> 02:43:10.000
Hello, it's Codeman

02:43:10.000 --> 02:43:12.000
Hey Codeman, how you doing?

02:43:12.000 --> 02:43:14.000
Sorry for the Facebook sounds, Rob

02:43:14.000 --> 02:43:16.000
You better be

02:43:16.000 --> 02:43:18.000
Do what?

02:43:18.000 --> 02:43:20.000
Is that you coughing? Or is that the little one?

02:43:20.000 --> 02:43:22.000
Oh no, she's asleep

02:43:22.000 --> 02:43:24.000
Oh, okay, well what's up?

02:43:24.000 --> 02:43:28.000
Oh no, I was just wanting to know if everyone's excited about August 13th

02:43:28.000 --> 02:43:30.000
I am totally jazzed about Tuesday

02:43:30.000 --> 02:43:32.000
And why?

02:43:32.000 --> 02:43:34.000
Is this Disney Infinite?

02:43:34.000 --> 02:43:36.000
Or what is it that you're excited about?

02:43:36.000 --> 02:43:38.000
DuckTales, isn't it?

02:43:38.000 --> 02:43:40.000
Oh, DuckTales

02:43:40.000 --> 02:43:42.000
I am excited about that, yes

02:43:42.000 --> 02:43:44.000
So excited I forgot the day

02:43:44.000 --> 02:43:46.000
Well, and like, what I was

02:43:46.000 --> 02:43:48.000
Just so fan, I mean, I was just

02:43:48.000 --> 02:43:50.000
Amazed about, like, they brought back

02:43:50.000 --> 02:43:52.000
Every single voice actor

02:43:52.000 --> 02:43:54.000
Yes

02:43:54.000 --> 02:43:56.000
That has ever played in the DuckTales series

02:43:56.000 --> 02:43:58.000
And, and, I'm not

02:43:58.000 --> 02:44:00.000
Quite sure how old

02:44:00.000 --> 02:44:02.000
The voice actor is for Scrooge McDuck

02:44:02.000 --> 02:44:04.000
He's in the, he's in his 90s, I know that

02:44:04.000 --> 02:44:06.000
Yeah, the lady with the magic of the spell

02:44:06.000 --> 02:44:08.000
Is old as hell too

02:44:08.000 --> 02:44:10.000
Yeah, and like, I was just

02:44:10.000 --> 02:44:12.000
Amazed at how the voice actually

02:44:12.000 --> 02:44:14.000
Sounded in, like, the trailers and stuff

02:44:14.000 --> 02:44:16.000
And I was like, it's

02:44:16.000 --> 02:44:18.000
It's perfect, like, it's the same

02:44:18.000 --> 02:44:20.000
Exact voice that was in

02:44:20.000 --> 02:44:22.000
The, you know, the game back in the day

02:44:22.000 --> 02:44:24.000
So I, you know, I'm really excited about that

02:44:24.000 --> 02:44:26.000
I just wanted to call in and talk about that

02:44:26.000 --> 02:44:28.000
Because I am just stoked

02:44:28.000 --> 02:44:30.000
About this game, I haven't been so

02:44:30.000 --> 02:44:32.000
Excited, well, except

02:44:32.000 --> 02:44:34.000
For when Earthbound was released, but

02:44:34.000 --> 02:44:36.000
But, I mean, I'm excited

02:44:36.000 --> 02:44:38.000
So excited about the game

02:44:38.000 --> 02:44:40.000
What platform? How do you guys feel about the game?

02:44:41.000 --> 02:44:43.000
Yes, I will definitely be picking it up

02:44:43.000 --> 02:44:45.000
But even I can't decide what platform

02:44:45.000 --> 02:44:47.000
Do I get it on, because I could do

02:44:47.000 --> 02:44:49.000
PC, I could do Wii U

02:44:49.000 --> 02:44:51.000
Because, you know, it's kind of the newest thing out there

02:44:51.000 --> 02:44:53.000
I could get PlayStation 3

02:44:53.000 --> 02:44:55.000
Because, you know, trophies or whatever

02:44:55.000 --> 02:44:57.000
Xbox 360s, where a lot of my friends will probably be

02:44:57.000 --> 02:44:59.000
I don't know, I don't know what system to get it on

02:44:59.000 --> 02:45:01.000
Have you decided?

02:45:01.000 --> 02:45:03.000
Unfortunately, I don't think they're releasing it

02:45:03.000 --> 02:45:05.000
For the Mac, so I can't get it on Steam

02:45:05.000 --> 02:45:07.000
But I can, I think

02:45:07.000 --> 02:45:09.000
I'm gonna be picking it up on the Wii U

02:45:09.000 --> 02:45:11.000
Why is that?

02:45:11.000 --> 02:45:13.000
Well, because, I don't know, it's just nostalgic

02:45:13.000 --> 02:45:15.000
Of, like, it being on Nintendo

02:45:15.000 --> 02:45:17.000
Like, when I used to play it when I was a kid

02:45:17.000 --> 02:45:19.000
And so, like, I feel like I should play it on a

02:45:19.000 --> 02:45:21.000
Nintendo console, it sounds stupid

02:45:21.000 --> 02:45:23.000
No, not at all

02:45:23.000 --> 02:45:25.000
I just feel like I should play it on a Nintendo console

02:45:25.000 --> 02:45:27.000
Okay, fair enough, I think I might end up

02:45:27.000 --> 02:45:29.000
Getting it on Wii U, because at least it does have the

02:45:29.000 --> 02:45:31.000
Off-screen play, which, you know, as little

02:45:31.000 --> 02:45:33.000
As it is, it is something the other

02:45:33.000 --> 02:45:35.000
Platforms don't get, so, and I think

02:45:35.000 --> 02:45:37.000
Xbox 360 is delayed anyway, so, I mean

02:45:38.000 --> 02:45:40.000
Yeah, I think it's September

02:45:40.000 --> 02:45:42.000
I could be wrong, but I think it's September

02:45:42.000 --> 02:45:44.000
13th or 14th, but I could be wrong

02:45:50.000 --> 02:45:52.000
I am, that's what I enjoy about the whole

02:45:52.000 --> 02:45:54.000
Earthbound things, you know, because my wife

02:45:54.000 --> 02:45:56.000
You know, she might want to watch Hulu

02:45:56.000 --> 02:45:58.000
Or Netflix or something, and I could just sit here

02:45:58.000 --> 02:46:00.000
On my Wii U tablet and play Earthbound

02:46:00.000 --> 02:46:02.000
All night, so that was really cool

02:46:02.000 --> 02:46:05.000
Oh, Nintendo wants you to sell some Wii U's

02:46:05.000 --> 02:46:07.000
That's exactly what they want to hear

02:46:07.000 --> 02:46:09.000
No, I love that about that console

02:46:09.000 --> 02:46:11.000
You know, I picked up Metroid

02:46:11.000 --> 02:46:13.000
You know, and all that stuff

02:46:13.000 --> 02:46:15.000
And so I can just sit there on my tablet

02:46:15.000 --> 02:46:17.000
And play that, so that's really cool

02:46:17.000 --> 02:46:19.000
Excellent

02:46:19.000 --> 02:46:21.000
Well, anything else you're looking forward to

02:46:21.000 --> 02:46:23.000
Over these coming weeks?

02:46:23.000 --> 02:46:25.000
Well, I mean, not really

02:46:25.000 --> 02:46:27.000
I'm going to be playing the hell out of DuckTales

02:46:27.000 --> 02:46:29.000
So that's probably the only thing

02:46:29.000 --> 02:46:31.000
I'm going to be playing for a while

02:46:31.000 --> 02:46:33.000
I've been playing Don't Starve

02:46:33.000 --> 02:46:35.000
It has stolen my life

02:46:35.000 --> 02:46:37.000
It literally has, I mean, that game

02:46:37.000 --> 02:46:39.000
I don't know if you've played it yet

02:46:39.000 --> 02:46:41.000
I haven't

02:46:41.000 --> 02:46:43.000
Not yet, but tell the listeners more about it

02:46:43.000 --> 02:46:45.000
For those that don't know, because you have been trying to

02:46:45.000 --> 02:46:47.000
Get me in on this game

02:46:47.000 --> 02:46:49.000
Well, Don't Starve is basically a roguelike game

02:46:49.000 --> 02:46:51.000
I mean, you start out at day one

02:46:51.000 --> 02:46:53.000
It is the title

02:46:53.000 --> 02:46:55.000
I mean, you're basically trying to survive

02:46:55.000 --> 02:46:57.000
And you just continue

02:46:57.000 --> 02:46:59.000
On and on and on

02:46:59.000 --> 02:47:01.000
And you go through all the seasons

02:47:01.000 --> 02:47:03.000
You start out in the spring

02:47:03.000 --> 02:47:05.000
Well, actually, I think you start in the summer

02:47:05.000 --> 02:47:07.000
And then you go into the spring, and then you go into the winter

02:47:07.000 --> 02:47:09.000
And then everything has everything to do with

02:47:09.000 --> 02:47:11.000
Like, you have to build

02:47:11.000 --> 02:47:13.000
Coats

02:47:13.000 --> 02:47:15.000
To stay warm

02:47:15.000 --> 02:47:17.000
You have to, you know, fires at night

02:47:17.000 --> 02:47:19.000
So you don't die from creatures in the night

02:47:19.000 --> 02:47:21.000
And all that stuff

02:47:21.000 --> 02:47:23.000
You have sanity that you have to keep up

02:47:23.000 --> 02:47:25.000
You have to constantly keep your belly full of food

02:47:25.000 --> 02:47:27.000
And then you have to constantly keep your health up

02:47:27.000 --> 02:47:29.000
So, I mean, it's such

02:47:29.000 --> 02:47:31.000
A frustrating game, because you get

02:47:31.000 --> 02:47:33.000
I think the other day I got to like

02:47:33.000 --> 02:47:35.000
Day 34 or something in the winter

02:47:35.000 --> 02:47:37.000
And I just ran out of food

02:47:37.000 --> 02:47:39.000
Because nothing grows in the winter

02:47:39.000 --> 02:47:41.000
And so then I died at day 34

02:47:41.000 --> 02:47:43.000
And it just starts you

02:47:43.000 --> 02:47:45.000
Back at day one with nothing

02:47:45.000 --> 02:47:47.000
I mean, I haven't played a roguelike game in forever

02:47:47.000 --> 02:47:49.000
So, I mean, it's just

02:47:49.000 --> 02:47:51.000
It's very frustrating, but it's a very fun game

02:47:51.000 --> 02:47:53.000
And I would suggest anybody

02:47:53.000 --> 02:47:55.000
On Steam to buy it

02:47:55.000 --> 02:47:57.000
And play the hell out of it

02:47:57.000 --> 02:47:59.000
I think it's $14.99

02:47:59.000 --> 02:48:01.000
And that's everything

02:48:01.000 --> 02:48:03.000
And they update it constantly

02:48:03.000 --> 02:48:05.000
With new places to go

02:48:05.000 --> 02:48:07.000
In wormholes

02:48:07.000 --> 02:48:09.000
And then there's like a

02:48:09.000 --> 02:48:11.000
There's different worlds all throughout the game

02:48:11.000 --> 02:48:13.000
So you can just continue going to different worlds

02:48:13.000 --> 02:48:15.000
I mean, it's an amazing game

02:48:15.000 --> 02:48:17.000
Well, I'm going to have to check that out at some point

02:48:17.000 --> 02:48:19.000
It does sound pretty hot

02:48:19.000 --> 02:48:21.000
And I live for roguelikes

02:48:21.000 --> 02:48:23.000
I'm enjoying Rogue Legacy as well, by the way

02:48:23.000 --> 02:48:25.000
Alright, well, Codeman, I'm going to let you go

02:48:25.000 --> 02:48:27.000
Thanks for calling in. Do you have anything you need to plug?

02:48:27.000 --> 02:48:29.000
Want to plug before we get out?

02:48:29.000 --> 02:48:31.000
No, not really

02:48:31.000 --> 02:48:33.000
I mean, we still have our podcast

02:48:33.000 --> 02:48:35.000
We still do it from time to time

02:48:35.000 --> 02:48:37.000
We've mostly moved to YouTube

02:48:37.000 --> 02:48:39.000
We do Google Hangouts

02:48:39.000 --> 02:48:41.000
But it's the YouTube.com

02:48:41.000 --> 02:48:43.000
Backslash The Down For Maintenance podcast

02:48:43.000 --> 02:48:45.000
Well, I think it's like the DFM podcast

02:48:45.000 --> 02:48:47.000
But you can look us up on YouTube

02:48:47.000 --> 02:48:49.000
And then I have a YouTube channel

02:48:49.000 --> 02:48:51.000
But, I mean, it's really hard to remember

02:48:51.000 --> 02:48:53.000
I mean, it's YouTube.com

02:48:53.000 --> 02:48:55.000
Backslash C. Taylor 1785

02:48:55.000 --> 02:48:57.000
Because YouTube won't let me change it

02:48:57.000 --> 02:49:03.000
But, yeah, you should do more Let's Plays, Rob

02:49:03.000 --> 02:49:06.000
You know, I was gifted by a kind listener

02:49:06.000 --> 02:49:08.000
Another scary game called Paranormal

02:49:08.000 --> 02:49:11.000
And that is up on the list of things I need to play, too

02:49:11.000 --> 02:49:13.000
Holy crap, that game is fantastic

02:49:13.000 --> 02:49:15.000
I hate it and love it all at the same time

02:49:15.000 --> 02:49:17.000
I'm not sure if I'm looking forward to it

02:49:17.000 --> 02:49:19.000
Alright, Codeman, I'm going to let you go, buddy

02:49:19.000 --> 02:49:21.000
Alright, well, I'll talk to you guys later

02:49:21.000 --> 02:49:22.000
Alright, take care

02:49:22.000 --> 02:49:23.000
Alright, bye

02:49:23.000 --> 02:49:25.000
Alright, and our phones are lighting up

02:49:25.000 --> 02:49:27.000
We've got another call coming in right now

02:49:27.000 --> 02:49:28.000
So let's go to the phones

02:49:28.000 --> 02:49:29.000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio

02:49:29.000 --> 02:49:30.000
Who's this?

02:49:30.000 --> 02:49:31.000
This is Shane

02:49:31.000 --> 02:49:32.000
Hey, Shane, how you doing?

02:49:32.000 --> 02:49:35.000
I'm hot, it's like really hot here right now

02:49:35.000 --> 02:49:36.000
Isn't it like

02:49:36.000 --> 02:49:38.000
You should come to California

02:49:38.000 --> 02:49:39.000
Isn't it hotter there?

02:49:39.000 --> 02:49:40.000
Yeah, probably

02:49:40.000 --> 02:49:42.000
But not at night, so come here

02:49:42.000 --> 02:49:44.000
Yeah, maybe

02:49:44.000 --> 02:49:46.000
We're not Phoenix or anything, and it's a dry heat

02:49:46.000 --> 02:49:47.000
Phoenix is terrible

02:49:47.000 --> 02:49:48.000
It is terrible

02:49:48.000 --> 02:49:49.000
What's up?

02:49:50.000 --> 02:49:51.000
Pokemon

02:49:51.000 --> 02:49:55.000
Oh, did you hear my little dedication to you earlier?

02:49:55.000 --> 02:49:58.000
Yeah, I take some issues with that dedication

02:49:58.000 --> 02:50:00.000
Why?

02:50:00.000 --> 02:50:02.000
Well, first of all, you ended it too quick

02:50:02.000 --> 02:50:05.000
Like, there's never enough time to talk about Pokemon

02:50:05.000 --> 02:50:09.000
Like, okay, for example, my job today

02:50:09.000 --> 02:50:12.000
I had a demo and I was demoing the new Mario and Luigi game

02:50:12.000 --> 02:50:14.000
And all the people that showed up

02:50:14.000 --> 02:50:16.000
Pretty much just wanted to talk Pokemon with me

02:50:16.000 --> 02:50:18.000
Which I was fine with, that was fun

02:50:18.000 --> 02:50:20.000
Way more fun than demoing a game

02:50:20.000 --> 02:50:32.000
But, yeah, like, I don't like the thought that it should have stopped after 151 Pokemon

02:50:32.000 --> 02:50:34.000
Sorry, Jamie

02:50:34.000 --> 02:50:38.000
Just because, like, that would have been boring

02:50:38.000 --> 02:50:40.000
You have to keep the series going

02:50:40.000 --> 02:50:44.000
And if you only had those same 151 were, like, 15 years now

02:50:44.000 --> 02:50:46.000
Or something like that since they first came out

02:50:46.000 --> 02:50:48.000
That would have been terrible

02:50:48.000 --> 02:50:52.000
So, yeah, we're at 649 plus whatever new ones are in here

02:50:52.000 --> 02:50:54.000
But it's still really fun

02:50:54.000 --> 02:50:58.000
And these mega evolutions, like the new trailer that was posted is awesome

02:50:58.000 --> 02:51:00.000
And it reminds me of Power Rangers

02:51:00.000 --> 02:51:01.000
So I am on board

02:51:01.000 --> 02:51:02.000
Wait a minute

02:51:02.000 --> 02:51:03.000
100% on board

02:51:03.000 --> 02:51:05.000
Wait a minute, because the other night you said, I don't know

02:51:05.000 --> 02:51:09.000
I know, but then they put a trailer that made it look like Power Rangers to me

02:51:09.000 --> 02:51:11.000
And that is all you need to do

02:51:12.000 --> 02:51:16.000
If there is more blue in the trailer and maybe some Taco Bell

02:51:16.000 --> 02:51:18.000
Which I'm still kind of boycotting

02:51:18.000 --> 02:51:20.000
Wait, you're boycotting Taco Bell?

02:51:20.000 --> 02:51:22.000
Yes, they got rid of some stuff I liked

02:51:22.000 --> 02:51:25.000
Uh-oh, that's right, they got rid of the volcano stuff, I forgot

02:51:25.000 --> 02:51:27.000
Yeah, and I really liked that

02:51:27.000 --> 02:51:28.000
We had this conversation the other night

02:51:28.000 --> 02:51:30.000
Fifth Dream in our chat room with a question for Shane

02:51:30.000 --> 02:51:33.000
Hey, they don't ask us questions anymore, they ask the caller's questions

02:51:33.000 --> 02:51:36.000
Fifth Dream wants to know, Shane, did you watch any of the Pokemon Championships?

02:51:36.000 --> 02:51:38.000
Yes, and I didn't want to

02:51:38.000 --> 02:51:41.000
I was just really bored, I was like, okay, this will be fun

02:51:41.000 --> 02:51:43.000
And that's my sarcastic voice

02:51:43.000 --> 02:51:45.000
So I put it on, it was so fun

02:51:45.000 --> 02:51:47.000
Like, it was really fun to watch

02:51:47.000 --> 02:51:51.000
And I watched some of the finals today before work

02:51:51.000 --> 02:51:54.000
And I was getting excited and there was no reason to

02:51:54.000 --> 02:51:57.000
And I feel like it was when I liked basketball

02:51:57.000 --> 02:51:59.000
When the NCAA tournament was going on

02:51:59.000 --> 02:52:02.000
Like, I just got sucked in and it was amazing

02:52:02.000 --> 02:52:06.000
Was it the Pokemon card game?

02:52:06.000 --> 02:52:09.000
They had the card game later today, which I was at work for

02:52:09.000 --> 02:52:12.000
So I couldn't watch that, it was the actual video games

02:52:12.000 --> 02:52:15.000
Wow, and Nintendo let them stream it?

02:52:15.000 --> 02:52:18.000
Well, because it's Nintendo sponsored

02:52:18.000 --> 02:52:21.000
Me and my friend Danny, we want to go to next year's championships

02:52:21.000 --> 02:52:23.000
It's in DC, this year was in Vancouver

02:52:23.000 --> 02:52:26.000
But they get all sorts of cool stuff

02:52:26.000 --> 02:52:28.000
They have all this merchandise

02:52:28.000 --> 02:52:31.000
And things that you won't find anywhere else

02:52:31.000 --> 02:52:33.000
Just at the World Championships

02:52:34.000 --> 02:52:39.000
And like today, or yesterday, they announced a new mega evolution

02:52:39.000 --> 02:52:42.000
And that they haven't put out anywhere else

02:52:42.000 --> 02:52:45.000
And they announced that they're going to have a soundtrack out on iTunes

02:52:45.000 --> 02:52:48.000
This November for X and Y, it's going to have 220 tracks

02:52:48.000 --> 02:52:49.000
Good lord

02:52:49.000 --> 02:52:51.000
Like, yeah, that's ridiculous

02:52:51.000 --> 02:52:52.000
Oh my gosh

02:52:52.000 --> 02:52:53.000
And I will have it day one

02:52:53.000 --> 02:52:57.000
So, what's the countdown to X and Y at this point?

02:52:57.000 --> 02:52:58.000
How many days left?

02:52:58.000 --> 02:53:01.000
It's like, almost exactly two months

02:53:01.000 --> 02:53:02.000
Tomorrow will be two months

02:53:02.000 --> 02:53:04.000
But for me, I don't know, because I'll get it early

02:53:04.000 --> 02:53:07.000
So, sucks to be everybody else

02:53:07.000 --> 02:53:10.000
At least you have Final Fantasy XIV to hold you over, right?

02:53:10.000 --> 02:53:11.000
Yes, yes

02:53:11.000 --> 02:53:13.000
And I learned today, 100%

02:53:13.000 --> 02:53:16.000
Because they put some sort of graph out

02:53:16.000 --> 02:53:18.000
That if I get the PS3 collector's edition

02:53:18.000 --> 02:53:20.000
Which I'm getting through Amazon, because I had gift cards

02:53:20.000 --> 02:53:22.000
So it's fully paid off

02:53:22.000 --> 02:53:25.000
And I apply it to my current PC account

02:53:25.000 --> 02:53:27.000
I will be able to play on both

02:53:27.000 --> 02:53:29.000
For the free 30 days

02:53:29.000 --> 02:53:31.000
And because I'm an old player

02:53:31.000 --> 02:53:34.000
My 30 days won't kick in until September 10th

02:53:34.000 --> 02:53:37.000
So I'll have from the 24th of August till September 10th

02:53:37.000 --> 02:53:39.000
Not paying anything

02:53:39.000 --> 02:53:43.000
And then September 11th for the next 30 days for free as well

02:53:43.000 --> 02:53:44.000
Hmm

02:53:44.000 --> 02:53:45.000
There you go

02:53:45.000 --> 02:53:47.000
And you get all that collector's edition crap that you don't need

02:53:47.000 --> 02:53:50.000
Um, don't need?

02:53:50.000 --> 02:53:52.000
That's rude

02:53:52.000 --> 02:53:54.000
Well, what's in there that you need?

02:53:54.000 --> 02:53:56.000
The book, the art book is going to be fantastic

02:53:56.000 --> 02:53:58.000
The baby soundtrack

02:53:58.000 --> 02:54:00.000
Because the other soundtrack is just way too expensive

02:54:00.000 --> 02:54:02.000
And I don't have anything that can play it except for a PS3

02:54:02.000 --> 02:54:04.000
Even though I want the little pet

02:54:04.000 --> 02:54:06.000
And um

02:54:06.000 --> 02:54:08.000
The box

02:54:08.000 --> 02:54:10.000
Okay, it's the box

02:54:10.000 --> 02:54:12.000
That's acceptable to say, right?

02:54:12.000 --> 02:54:14.000
Like, because the box looks cool

02:54:14.000 --> 02:54:16.000
Alright, fair enough

02:54:16.000 --> 02:54:18.000
Yes, exactly

02:54:18.000 --> 02:54:20.000
Alright, Shane, anything else before we let you go?

02:54:20.000 --> 02:54:22.000
Um, everybody should watch that new trailer

02:54:22.000 --> 02:54:25.000
It has like rock music that plays during it

02:54:25.000 --> 02:54:27.000
And it's like remixed, I think, of a gym theme

02:54:27.000 --> 02:54:31.000
And seriously, if it doesn't remind you of Power Rangers

02:54:31.000 --> 02:54:33.000
Which is what I'm seeing from everybody's comments

02:54:33.000 --> 02:54:35.000
Everywhere on the internet that I'm looking right now

02:54:35.000 --> 02:54:37.000
You're crazy

02:54:37.000 --> 02:54:39.000
Because the end with the five of them lined up

02:54:39.000 --> 02:54:41.000
And their mega evolutions is totally Power Rangers

02:54:41.000 --> 02:54:43.000
It's awesome

02:54:43.000 --> 02:54:45.000
Alright, anything you want to plug while you're here on the show?

02:54:45.000 --> 02:54:47.000
Um

02:54:47.000 --> 02:54:49.000
Well, I just plugged Pokemon X and Y

02:54:49.000 --> 02:54:51.000
And we talked about Final Fantasy XIV

02:54:51.000 --> 02:54:53.000
Um

02:54:53.000 --> 02:54:55.000
Yes, sure

02:54:55.000 --> 02:54:57.000
Apparently, there's a really cool Konami game in Japan

02:54:57.000 --> 02:54:59.000
Called Sound Vortex

02:54:59.000 --> 02:55:01.000
And I've watched videos and it's awesome

02:55:01.000 --> 02:55:03.000
Somebody, I guess, cracked it

02:55:03.000 --> 02:55:05.000
So you can play on your PC

02:55:05.000 --> 02:55:07.000
And there are websites now building controllers

02:55:07.000 --> 02:55:09.000
For the Sound Vortex game that you can buy

02:55:09.000 --> 02:55:11.000
That you'd be able to hook up to your PC and play it

02:55:11.000 --> 02:55:13.000
And that game is so cool looking

02:55:13.000 --> 02:55:15.000
You need to link me this

02:55:15.000 --> 02:55:17.000
I need to get a link to Sound Vortex

02:55:17.000 --> 02:55:19.000
Or for the controller

02:55:19.000 --> 02:55:21.000
The controller is like $300 and some dollars

02:55:21.000 --> 02:55:23.000
I can link you the gameplay

02:55:23.000 --> 02:55:25.000
It's amazing

02:55:25.000 --> 02:55:27.000
Alright, get on the case, Nancy Drew

02:55:27.000 --> 02:55:29.000
Uh, my name is Shane

02:55:29.000 --> 02:55:31.000
Alright, bye, Shane

02:55:31.000 --> 02:55:33.000
Bye

02:55:33.000 --> 02:55:35.000
1877 Game OLR

02:55:35.000 --> 02:55:37.000
Our username on Skype is

02:55:37.000 --> 02:55:39.000
OrangeLoungeRadio

02:55:39.000 --> 02:55:41.000
Going to some tweets real quick

02:55:41.000 --> 02:55:43.000
I'm going to do these pretty quick here because we're running kind of late tonight

02:55:43.000 --> 02:55:45.000
Dark Tetsuya sends the show a tweet that says

02:55:45.000 --> 02:55:47.000
Hey, just a note, the latest version of

02:55:47.000 --> 02:55:49.000
Super Mario Crossover, or 3.0

02:55:49.000 --> 02:55:51.000
Is now out and it's available at

02:55:51.000 --> 02:55:53.000
ExplodingRabbit.com

02:55:53.000 --> 02:55:55.000
Did they do a Kickstarter for that one?

02:55:55.000 --> 02:55:57.000
No, they did a Kickstarter for their game that's not quite

02:55:57.000 --> 02:55:59.000
That game, but it's

02:55:59.000 --> 02:56:01.000
All the characters changed is slightly

02:56:01.000 --> 02:56:03.000
Renamed and their own original levels

02:56:03.000 --> 02:56:05.000
Got it, got it

02:56:05.000 --> 02:56:07.000
Act F says

02:56:07.000 --> 02:56:09.000
The King of Fighters XIII Steam Edition

02:56:09.000 --> 02:56:11.000
Trailer was leaked in the Steam store

02:56:11.000 --> 02:56:13.000
And removed

02:56:13.000 --> 02:56:15.000
So King of Fighters XIII probably coming

02:56:15.000 --> 02:56:17.000
To Steam at some point

02:56:17.000 --> 02:56:19.000
TigerClaw sent us a tweet

02:56:19.000 --> 02:56:21.000
Imagi Studios originally was going to make

02:56:21.000 --> 02:56:23.000
A Legend of Zelda movie, check out the short movie

02:56:23.000 --> 02:56:25.000
Pitch video and he linked us to YouTube

02:56:25.000 --> 02:56:27.000
I actually did see this earlier in the week

02:56:27.000 --> 02:56:29.000
And it did look pretty cool

02:56:29.000 --> 02:56:31.000
Although there was no, I don't believe there was any voices

02:56:31.000 --> 02:56:33.000
In it, but it did, it looked interesting

02:56:33.000 --> 02:56:35.000
But you know, Nintendo

02:56:35.000 --> 02:56:37.000
Is crazy possessive over their IPs

02:56:37.000 --> 02:56:39.000
Ever since that Super Mario Brothers movie was a

02:56:39.000 --> 02:56:41.000
Stink bomb, so I'm not

02:56:41.000 --> 02:56:43.000
Surprised they didn't get to go forward with it

02:56:43.000 --> 02:56:45.000
But it sure made a great little YouTube to look at

02:56:45.000 --> 02:56:47.000
Did you guys see that at all?

02:56:47.000 --> 02:56:49.000
The little concept, the Zelda pitch

02:56:49.000 --> 02:56:51.000
No, it was neat

02:56:51.000 --> 02:56:53.000
Alright, I'll give it one more minute

02:56:53.000 --> 02:56:55.000
To see if anybody's going to call in, but if not

02:56:55.000 --> 02:56:57.000
We'll close up shop, 1-877-GAME-OLR

02:56:57.000 --> 02:56:59.000
Or our username on Skype is

02:56:59.000 --> 02:57:01.000
OrangeLoungeRadio, anybody else

02:57:01.000 --> 02:57:03.000
Have a last minute story for us tonight?

02:57:03.000 --> 02:57:05.000
Well, actually

02:57:05.000 --> 02:57:07.000
Not necessarily a story, but I'm going to

02:57:07.000 --> 02:57:09.000
Start making my 3DS

02:57:09.000 --> 02:57:11.000
Cases, and put them

02:57:11.000 --> 02:57:13.000
Available to sell before too long

02:57:13.000 --> 02:57:15.000
Is that an Etsy thing?

02:57:15.000 --> 02:57:17.000
I might do it on Etsy, either that or Storenvy

02:57:17.000 --> 02:57:19.000
I'm still deciding

02:57:19.000 --> 02:57:21.000
And why would somebody want a 3DS case from Dark Sakura?

02:57:21.000 --> 02:57:23.000
Because they are well made and protect your system

02:57:23.000 --> 02:57:25.000
A lot better than this flip up in cases do

02:57:25.000 --> 02:57:27.000
Fair enough, alright

02:57:27.000 --> 02:57:29.000
We do have one more call coming in, this will probably be the last one

02:57:29.000 --> 02:57:31.000
For tonight, so let's go to it

02:57:31.000 --> 02:57:33.000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

02:57:33.000 --> 02:57:35.000
Hello

02:57:35.000 --> 02:57:37.000
Hello

02:57:37.000 --> 02:57:39.000
It's OrangeLoungeRadio

02:57:39.000 --> 02:57:41.000
Hello

02:57:41.000 --> 02:57:43.000
This is HeyacDeft

02:57:43.000 --> 02:57:45.000
HeyacDeft, and we see you, it's a video call

02:57:45.000 --> 02:57:47.000
Hi

02:57:47.000 --> 02:57:49.000
Hello

02:57:49.000 --> 02:57:51.000
Is that a My Little Pony?

02:57:51.000 --> 02:57:53.000
No, it's a Pokemon

02:57:53.000 --> 02:57:55.000
Oh, it's a Pokemon

02:57:55.000 --> 02:57:57.000
Uh oh, Shane's going to kill me for that one too

02:57:57.000 --> 02:57:59.000
You know, I need to get my plus and minus ones back from Julian

02:57:59.000 --> 02:58:01.000
Send them to Shane

02:58:01.000 --> 02:58:03.000
Which Pokemon is that?

02:58:03.000 --> 02:58:05.000
It's the Pokemon Black and White

02:58:05.000 --> 02:58:07.000
Legendary Rusharound

02:58:07.000 --> 02:58:09.000
Oh, okay, alright

02:58:10.000 --> 02:58:13.000
So you just call in tonight to show off your plushie?

02:58:13.000 --> 02:58:15.000
Not really, I want to talk about

02:58:15.000 --> 02:58:17.000
Pac-Man Z DX Plus

02:58:17.000 --> 02:58:19.000
Ah, the game that

02:58:19.000 --> 02:58:21.000
Alan was talking about earlier, right?

02:58:21.000 --> 02:58:23.000
Yeah, I'm pretty excited about it

02:58:23.000 --> 02:58:25.000
Because I'm a fan of

02:58:25.000 --> 02:58:27.000
Pac-Man Z

02:58:27.000 --> 02:58:29.000
I played the hell out of it

02:58:29.000 --> 02:58:31.000
I even got in the

02:58:31.000 --> 02:58:33.000
In the beginning

02:58:33.000 --> 02:58:35.000
When it was released

02:58:35.000 --> 02:58:37.000
I was in the top 40 scores

02:58:37.000 --> 02:58:39.000
That game

02:58:39.000 --> 02:58:41.000
Yeah, like I said, I played it a lot

02:58:41.000 --> 02:58:43.000
Like, a freaking lot

02:58:43.000 --> 02:58:45.000
So I'm pretty excited

02:58:45.000 --> 02:58:47.000
To have

02:58:47.000 --> 02:58:49.000
Or at least being able to play

02:58:49.000 --> 02:58:51.000
DX because what I have

02:58:51.000 --> 02:58:53.000
Seen about it, it seems pretty

02:58:53.000 --> 02:58:55.000
Damn cool

02:58:55.000 --> 02:58:57.000
And mostly

02:58:57.000 --> 02:58:59.000
The reason

02:58:59.000 --> 02:59:01.000
I haven't even

02:59:01.000 --> 02:59:03.000
Been able to play it

02:59:03.000 --> 02:59:05.000
It's because

02:59:05.000 --> 02:59:07.000
It's not available in Mexico

02:59:07.000 --> 02:59:09.000
For some reason

02:59:09.000 --> 02:59:11.000
I don't know why

02:59:11.000 --> 02:59:13.000
So I'm pretty stoked that it's coming to Steam

02:59:13.000 --> 02:59:15.000
Even since the

02:59:15.000 --> 02:59:17.000
Announcement

02:59:17.000 --> 02:59:19.000
It was a few months ago

02:59:19.000 --> 02:59:21.000
I don't remember when exactly

02:59:21.000 --> 02:59:23.000
But I'm pretty excited

02:59:23.000 --> 02:59:25.000
To see it now

02:59:25.000 --> 02:59:27.000
Being able to

02:59:27.000 --> 02:59:29.000
Purchase ahead

02:59:29.000 --> 02:59:31.000
Not to say pre-purchase or pre-order

02:59:31.000 --> 02:59:33.000
Hahahaha

02:59:33.000 --> 02:59:35.000
You got everybody trained, DarkSagra

02:59:35.000 --> 02:59:37.000
What?

02:59:37.000 --> 02:59:39.000
He took great care to make

02:59:39.000 --> 02:59:41.000
Sure he said purchase ahead

02:59:41.000 --> 02:59:43.000
Yes, which is how it should be

02:59:43.000 --> 02:59:45.000
Because it's wrong to put

02:59:45.000 --> 02:59:47.000
Unnecessary prefix

02:59:47.000 --> 02:59:49.000
Didn't you listen to George Carlin?

02:59:49.000 --> 02:59:51.000
Geez, Rob

02:59:51.000 --> 02:59:53.000
How dare I speak up

02:59:53.000 --> 02:59:55.000
The only sad part is that

02:59:55.000 --> 02:59:57.000
We have to wait at least

02:59:57.000 --> 02:59:59.000
One month and a half

02:59:59.000 --> 03:00:01.000
To be able to play it since it releases

03:00:01.000 --> 03:00:03.000
On the 25th

03:00:03.000 --> 03:00:05.000
So yeah, but

03:00:05.000 --> 03:00:07.000
The extra content will be

03:00:07.000 --> 03:00:09.000
Pretty good too

03:00:09.000 --> 03:00:11.000
The Rally Access skin

03:00:11.000 --> 03:00:13.000
The Dick Duck skin

03:00:13.000 --> 03:00:15.000
There's even old school

03:00:15.000 --> 03:00:17.000
Pac-Man skin

03:00:17.000 --> 03:00:19.000
So that's gonna be pretty cool

03:00:19.000 --> 03:00:21.000
I just love that this game is how old

03:00:21.000 --> 03:00:23.000
And they're still supporting it

03:00:23.000 --> 03:00:25.000
Like this was really a pleasant surprise

03:00:25.000 --> 03:00:27.000
Because it was at the point where the game was

03:00:27.000 --> 03:00:29.000
Plus, I mean I had it on 360 anyway

03:00:29.000 --> 03:00:31.000
But now I have it on PlayStation

03:00:31.000 --> 03:00:33.000
Because why not, it was free

03:00:33.000 --> 03:00:35.000
So I picked it up there too to try and get some trophies

03:00:35.000 --> 03:00:37.000
And now it's pretty cool to know that, oh okay

03:00:37.000 --> 03:00:39.000
Now I can get this DLC

03:00:39.000 --> 03:00:41.000
Which maybe that's the reason they were giving it away for free

03:00:41.000 --> 03:00:43.000
Was to try and make a sale there

03:00:43.000 --> 03:00:45.000
But, eh, it'll work

03:00:45.000 --> 03:00:47.000
It'll work

03:00:47.000 --> 03:00:49.000
Yeah, they sure have gotten a sale out of me

03:00:49.000 --> 03:00:51.000
Alright

03:00:51.000 --> 03:00:53.000
Well, anything else you're looking forward to this year?

03:00:53.000 --> 03:00:55.000
Well, mostly this coming week

03:00:55.000 --> 03:00:57.000
Like DuckTales

03:00:57.000 --> 03:00:59.000
Like everyone else

03:00:59.000 --> 03:01:01.000
I bet Codeman's happy to hear that

03:01:01.000 --> 03:01:03.000
What system are you getting DuckTales on?

03:01:03.000 --> 03:01:05.000
Most possibly Steam, but I'm still debating on it

03:01:05.000 --> 03:01:07.000
Okay

03:01:07.000 --> 03:01:09.000
Very cool

03:01:09.000 --> 03:01:11.000
Alright, well Act F, we're gonna let you go so we can wrap up the show

03:01:11.000 --> 03:01:13.000
But thank you and your little Pokemon there for calling in

03:01:13.000 --> 03:01:15.000
Who's waving goodbye, adorable

03:01:15.000 --> 03:01:17.000
Alright, bye Act F, thanks for the call

03:01:17.000 --> 03:01:19.000
We love the video calls, take care

03:01:19.000 --> 03:01:21.000
Alright, that's gonna do it

03:01:21.000 --> 03:01:23.000
Shane never answered my question

03:01:23.000 --> 03:01:25.000
I'm just gonna see if he wanted my giant Togepi

03:01:25.000 --> 03:01:27.000
He probably turned the show off, so don't give it to him

03:01:27.000 --> 03:01:29.000
But you know what?

03:01:29.000 --> 03:01:31.000
Did I tell you how I got my giant Togepi?

03:01:31.000 --> 03:01:33.000
I got held up at gunpoint

03:01:33.000 --> 03:01:35.000
Working at GNC

03:01:35.000 --> 03:01:37.000
Oh god, yeah, that's a horrible story

03:01:37.000 --> 03:01:39.000
And I found $10 in the parking lot outside Toys R Us

03:01:41.000 --> 03:01:43.000
And I went in

03:01:43.000 --> 03:01:45.000
And I used it to buy myself a giant Togepi

03:01:45.000 --> 03:01:47.000
The $20 Togepi

03:01:47.000 --> 03:01:49.000
You earned it

03:01:49.000 --> 03:01:51.000
And so my giant Togepi

03:01:51.000 --> 03:01:53.000
Was like my comfort creature thing

03:01:53.000 --> 03:01:55.000
And my Charmander pillow

03:01:55.000 --> 03:01:57.000
Well we have to wrap up the show

03:01:57.000 --> 03:01:59.000
Guys, it's about that time

03:01:59.000 --> 03:02:01.000
We're running a little long tonight

03:02:01.000 --> 03:02:03.000
And Alan and I still have errands to run after the show

03:02:03.000 --> 03:02:05.000
So we're gonna wrap up the show

03:02:05.000 --> 03:02:07.000
I wanna start with Alan tonight

03:02:07.000 --> 03:02:09.000
Thank you very much for being here tonight

03:02:09.000 --> 03:02:11.000
Really appreciate you being on the show

03:02:11.000 --> 03:02:13.000
And lending your wit

03:02:13.000 --> 03:02:15.000
And so forth, don't be a stranger

03:02:15.000 --> 03:02:17.000
You only live here

03:02:17.000 --> 03:02:19.000
So do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

03:02:19.000 --> 03:02:21.000
Um

03:02:21.000 --> 03:02:23.000
If I can get my headset replaced

03:02:23.000 --> 03:02:25.000
I might start doing like an achievement run

03:02:25.000 --> 03:02:27.000
In Half Life for Twitch TV

03:02:27.000 --> 03:02:29.000
Fun!

03:02:29.000 --> 03:02:31.000
You think it's time to go wireless?

03:02:31.000 --> 03:02:33.000
I don't know, I've had bad experiences with wireless

03:02:33.000 --> 03:02:35.000
Do you have like a Twitter you wanna plug?

03:02:35.000 --> 03:02:37.000
Or anything you wanna plug if people wanna

03:02:37.000 --> 03:02:39.000
Get your wit online? Because you are really funny

03:02:39.000 --> 03:02:41.000
I actually am on Twitter a lot now

03:02:41.000 --> 03:02:43.000
I finally got Twitter

03:02:43.000 --> 03:02:45.000
How it works

03:02:45.000 --> 03:02:47.000
I always just ignore it

03:02:48.000 --> 03:02:50.000
Okay

03:02:50.000 --> 03:02:52.000
It's very salacious

03:02:52.000 --> 03:02:54.000
Alright

03:02:54.000 --> 03:02:56.000
Loki, sorry we didn't get to all the last minute news

03:02:56.000 --> 03:02:58.000
But we're trying to wrap up

03:02:58.000 --> 03:03:00.000
It's been a long show, it's almost 9.30

03:03:00.000 --> 03:03:02.000
Do you have any last minute thoughts for our listeners tonight?

03:03:02.000 --> 03:03:04.000
Uh

03:03:04.000 --> 03:03:06.000
No, not really

03:03:06.000 --> 03:03:08.000
And I will say my final thought tonight

03:03:08.000 --> 03:03:10.000
Is I better be over this damn cold tomorrow

03:03:10.000 --> 03:03:12.000
Because I need to get back to work

03:03:12.000 --> 03:03:14.000
I have a ton of work to catch up on for being sick

03:03:14.000 --> 03:03:16.000
For two days

03:03:16.000 --> 03:03:18.000
One plague can kiss my ass

03:03:18.000 --> 03:03:20.000
Dark Soccer, your final thought tonight

03:03:23.000 --> 03:03:25.000
I want a house

03:03:25.000 --> 03:03:27.000
And a job

03:03:28.000 --> 03:03:30.000
Probably in that order

03:03:30.000 --> 03:03:32.000
In that order

03:03:32.000 --> 03:03:34.000
By the way

03:03:34.000 --> 03:03:36.000
My cat is the cutest animal in the universe

03:03:36.000 --> 03:03:38.000
Um, next to Sanrio, yes

03:03:38.000 --> 03:03:40.000
Do you know what the next Pink Berry flavor's gonna be?

03:03:40.000 --> 03:03:42.000
Peanut butter

03:03:42.000 --> 03:03:44.000
No, that's out now

03:03:44.000 --> 03:03:46.000
Butter pecan

03:03:46.000 --> 03:03:48.000
Girl

03:03:48.000 --> 03:03:50.000
You know what, they need to start paying advertising on this program

03:03:50.000 --> 03:03:52.000
For us to keep talking about them

03:03:52.000 --> 03:03:54.000
Alright, in all seriousness, thank you for staying with our show tonight

03:03:54.000 --> 03:03:56.000
And listening to the show

03:03:56.000 --> 03:03:58.000
After a week off, we really appreciate you sticking with us

03:03:58.000 --> 03:04:00.000
And supporting independent broadcasting

03:04:00.000 --> 03:04:02.000
And if for whatever reason

03:04:02.000 --> 03:04:04.000
You listened to this entire show and you thought it was terrible

03:04:04.000 --> 03:04:06.000
Hey, that's okay

03:04:06.000 --> 03:04:08.000
Just all we ask is, find another great

03:04:08.000 --> 03:04:10.000
Independent podcast producer and support that

03:04:10.000 --> 03:04:12.000
Support all of our independent podcast friends

03:04:12.000 --> 03:04:14.000
And if you do like Orange Lawn Tradio

03:04:14.000 --> 03:04:16.000
And you did like what you hear

03:04:16.000 --> 03:04:18.000
Help spread the word, tell a friend or five about the show

03:04:18.000 --> 03:04:20.000
And spread the word about Orange Lawn Tradio

03:04:20.000 --> 03:04:22.000
And help us grow our little family

03:04:22.000 --> 03:04:24.000
In the meantime, we will be back next week

03:04:24.000 --> 03:04:26.000
Same time and same place

03:04:26.000 --> 03:04:28.000
To do it all over again

03:04:28.000 --> 03:04:30.000
With DuckTales coming out this week

03:04:30.000 --> 03:04:32.000
And Disney Infinity next Sunday

03:04:32.000 --> 03:04:34.000
I'm sure there'll be plenty of new stuff to talk about

03:04:34.000 --> 03:04:36.000
Oh, I'll probably have Saints Row by then

03:04:36.000 --> 03:04:38.000
Final Fantasy XIV beta as well

03:04:38.000 --> 03:04:40.000
There'll be lots and lots of stuff next week

03:04:40.000 --> 03:04:42.000
Do join us again next week

03:04:42.000 --> 03:04:44.000
You guys, thank you very much for tuning in

03:04:44.000 --> 03:04:46.000
Have a wonderful week

03:04:46.000 --> 03:04:48.000
Good night

03:05:10.000 --> 03:05:12.000
Those of the staff of Orange Lawn Tradio

03:05:12.000 --> 03:05:14.000
Or VOG Network

03:05:14.000 --> 03:05:16.000
But you know they were all still true

03:05:16.000 --> 03:05:18.000
See you next week
