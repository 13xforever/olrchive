0	21080	The PlayStation 4's launch is detailed, League of Legends experiences a security breach,
21080	31480	and you can soon return digital copies of games in one online store.
31480	34800	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show
34800	41580	where every gamer has a voice, it is Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 517 for this
41580	44880	August the 25th of 2013.
44880	51040	Pull up a chair in our live chat room, live.vognetwork.com where you can participate with the pro
51040	54800	program as we talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
54800	60720	My name's Rob Roberts, here with you as always every week, my co-hosts say hello to DarkSakura
60720	61720	or Jamie Summers.
61720	62720	Hi.
62720	63720	Hi, how are you?
63720	64720	Sniffy.
64720	66080	Yeah, you sound, you are having hecka allergies today.
66080	71640	Or something, I was just, this morning I woke up and was really congested and it's all
71640	73640	cytus too because it's all just in my nose.
73640	78360	I know the city where we're based, Sacramento, California is not a very pleasant one for
78360	83160	allergy sufferers, but I always thought that was more of a spring thing, so you can get
83160	85000	it pretty bad this time of year too.
85000	88520	I don't even know what set it off really, I mean, it may have been left over from the
88520	91880	fires, it could have been, I don't know, but.
91880	97920	Oh yeah, those fires, there's these horrible fires burning outside of Yosemite, this big
97920	102080	national park that's, now it's really far, well, you know, it's probably what, like a
102080	103080	five, six hour drive from here.
103080	104920	Also, it caused a minor heat wave for us.
104920	109360	But, oh yeah, I mean, it's really burning out of control, so I don't think I know anybody
109360	113680	in the OLR listening base that lives in that area, but if you do, I really hope you're
113680	118360	safe and taking care of yourself, you know, and my thoughts go out to you guys, because
118360	120280	pretty terrible, that fire out there.
120280	126000	I've had Benadryl and Sudafed and I even laid down, well, it just doesn't seem to be doing
126000	127760	much good, so.
127760	129440	Well, I hope you feel better.
129440	130440	I'm not sick.
130440	132000	Despite all the fires and all that.
132000	133280	I feel awful though.
133640	138480	Well, feel better if you need more coffee, because coffee helps.
138480	139840	I'm full of Ricolas now.
139840	143400	Well, speaking of our hometown of Sacramento, I wanted to mention this real quick with you,
143400	148560	and we referenced this on Bobby Black Wolf's show, just before we went live tonight, but
148560	152600	here in Sacramento, California, you know, once in a while we get celebrities, because
152600	157140	they come up here from Hollywood to lobby for different bills and so forth.
157140	158520	Or in this case, come from England.
158520	163040	Yes, or we used to have a governor, but I won't go there, you all know about that.
163040	164800	But in this case, in town.
164800	166400	That's actually happened twice.
166400	167400	That's true.
167400	168400	That's true, because there was Reagan.
168400	170880	Yeah, he was a famous movie actor too.
170880	177120	But anyway, past all the politics stuff, Democrat, Republican and everything in between, doesn't
177120	179200	matter who you are, you love John Barrowman.
179200	180200	Oh, yes.
180200	184360	If you know who he is, we'll get to that in a minute, because Tech Master Loki had no
184360	191500	idea who he was, but he's from Doctor Who and Torchwood and what he was one of the people
191500	193420	and the new producers.
193420	198700	He also was on a couple of series in England where it was like, one of them was How Do
198700	202500	You Solve a Problem, like Maria, where they cast for West End plays.
202500	203820	He did stage stuff and all that.
203820	206420	It's basically like American Idol for stage theater.
206420	214080	And he's just, no matter your sexuality or who you are, you have to admit, he is a very
214080	216260	gorgeous, handsome man.
216260	219580	So a lot of people like him for that reason alone.
219660	222820	But he's here in Sacramento and we can't figure out why.
222820	224940	There's a big nerd convention coming up next weekend.
224940	226740	Can't he just be in town?
226740	229140	I guess, but I'm kind of like, well, why would he?
229140	231780	And I'm even thinking about the little bit I know about him.
231780	235700	His family's in Florida and the rest of his, and he lives in England.
235700	236700	Who knows?
236700	239860	Maybe, maybe he came to San Francisco and thought he'd swing by.
239860	244660	But here's my hope, since he's supposed to be at Dragon Con in a few days, as am I.
244660	249260	I got my fingers on my toes crossed that we might be on the same flight.
249260	254220	I don't pray very often, but if anybody up there is listening, I want to be on the same
254220	256340	flight as John Barrowman to Atlanta.
256340	258100	Five and a half hours on a plane with John Barrowman.
258100	259100	Yes, please.
259100	260700	What are you flying?
260700	261700	Delta.
261700	265180	It's the only one that had a direct flight to Atlanta.
265180	266180	It might have a first class.
266180	267180	You know?
267180	268180	Yeah, I think they do.
268180	269940	I wonder if, I wonder if his husband came along.
269940	270940	I think so.
270940	271940	I think he was in the pictures.
271940	272940	All right.
272940	273940	Anyway, listeners are here.
273940	275020	They're entirely too cute together.
275020	279980	They're here to hear about video games, not to hear about John Barrowman, although quite
279980	282060	frankly, who's going to complain?
282060	284140	Maybe Techmaster Loki will complain.
284140	285940	Hey, Techmaster Loki, how you doing?
285940	286940	Doing good.
286940	287940	Yeah?
287940	290820	Well, we need to edumacate you on who John Barrowman is.
290820	291820	You should Google him or something.
291820	292820	Yeah, I did.
292820	293820	I still don't know who he is.
293820	294820	Did you?
294820	295820	It didn't look familiar, huh?
295820	296820	Nope.
296820	301500	All right, go into our chat room, live.vognetwork.com, because we do tape live at the Voice of Geeks
301500	305300	Network every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after
305300	309880	the Bobby Black Wolf show, and Brad from Pod Culture in there saying, John Barrowman grabbed
309880	317220	my cohost Adam's ass in a photo op, and I bet Adam didn't wash that ass for an entire
317220	318220	week.
318220	319220	Or at least the jeans attached to the ass.
319220	322820	At least the jeans attached to them.
322820	326780	Tekanist in chat suggesting I make friends with a stewardess.
326780	327780	I may have to.
327780	330580	They're called flight attendants now.
330580	333620	Alan Alchemy says, Rob, you aren't in first class, though.
333620	337900	That doesn't mean I won't still find a way to run into him.
337900	340020	Don't question my powers.
340020	344700	All right, anyhow, Loki, how have you been?
344700	347700	What's new with you?
347700	348700	Not a whole ton.
348700	354740	So, I thought of you earlier today, because apparently all this Grand Theft Auto 5 information
354740	358740	is leaking to the internet, and at first I thought, oh my gosh, there's a pirated version
358740	362460	of the game out there already, and those poor guys are gonna, you know, lose those
362460	366440	sales because it's already out there on the internet when we're weeks away from launch.
366440	368460	But that's not totally the case, right, Loki?
368460	370260	What's going on in the Grand Theft Auto world?
370260	377620	The European region had the digital version of it that people had preordered, became live
377620	383500	for a little bit, so, not necessarily live, but you can preload it, so people were downloading
383500	390460	the 18 gig file to their PS3, and of course, you know, they would dump it and, you know,
390460	394500	try to hack it to get it to run and stuff, but they haven't really been able to hack
394500	395500	it.
395500	398660	I don't think that they're gonna get it to run either, because, and there's, you know,
398660	405020	this guy, Good NTS, or, I think it's Good NTS, he does, like, he is one of the ones
405020	411420	that developed all the tools for hacking Grand Theft Auto, basically, he says there's no
411420	417180	way to, like, open up the archives yet, because they don't have the keys to do that, and I
417180	421100	don't think that the executable is included with that, I think that's what comes in the
421100	427380	patch, so even if you could, you know, hack it, there's that day one patch when it finally
427380	431580	goes live that brings the executable in, and, you know, until you have the executable, you're
431580	433560	not gonna build it too much with it.
433560	438620	But they have been dumping stuff out of it, including all the cutscene audio and audio
438620	439620	from the game.
439660	442380	You know, WhatUpG in our chatroom says the soundtrack leaked.
442380	447820	Yeah, so the soundtrack's leaked, and a lot of the spoilers from the game have leaked
447820	451660	as well, because they have all the cutscene audio, so there, people are documenting it.
451660	455460	I've been pretty good in trying to stay away from all that stuff, I did read one thing,
455460	460000	but it, you know, I kind of figured some of the people from the other games would be coming
460000	465060	back in the game, like in one, like a cameo or something like that, so it's not a huge
465060	469140	deal, but, you know, I'm trying not to read any spoilers in the game.
469140	471580	Wow, you're usually the first to spoil everything.
471580	476020	No, no, no, I never do, I never try to spoil myself when it comes to, you know, a lot of
476020	477020	these things.
477020	478020	When it comes to holy things.
478020	484100	Well, it kind of, just like, I try not to spoil anything, now, if there was a working
484100	488180	version out there that leaked through the internet, that's a whole nother story, so.
488180	490460	That's not necessarily spoiling, you're playing through the game.
490460	492140	No, that's, you know, I intend on-
492140	493140	Illegally.
493140	494140	Illegally.
494140	496940	I intend, eh, whatever, you know what, I intend on purchasing on both platforms, so-
496940	497940	I know-
497940	498940	I don't care.
498940	500140	I know you, Loki.
500140	503980	If it did leak, you would be downloading it and playing it, and yes, you'd be one of those
503980	507060	bad people, but you would still be buying two copies of it.
507060	508340	Oh, yeah, absolutely, so.
508340	510540	That's why I'm not giving you a worse time about it.
510540	514540	Yeah, I'm still, you know, I'm buying it on both platforms, just so I can play with my
514540	518140	friends, because I don't know what platform they're going to play on.
518140	521820	You know, I still want to play on 360, because I like the controller better, but, you know,
521820	526940	my boss plays on PS3, and he's trying to get other people to buy the PS3 version as well.
526940	531620	I guess there is one of my coworkers in Dallas, he's buying both versions as well, so.
531620	535420	I still want to play on 360, but I think a lot of people are going to be playing on PS3
535420	538260	as well, so I'll just have to play both.
538260	542780	And whatupg in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com also says, I am not here to spoil things.
542780	544620	If people want spoilers, they can look for them.
544620	549820	And I think that's the nice thing to do, so please, chatters, you all are very well-behaved.
549820	550820	Please do not spoil-
550820	553940	If you want to look up spoilers, it's on GTAForums.com.
553940	559100	They have a whole section of their forum dedicated to granting out five spoilers, if you really
559100	564700	want to look at it, but I urge you not to, because why would you want to spoil yourself,
564700	567020	you know, to some of the twists and stuff in the game?
567020	568020	It's just not worth it.
568020	569020	Soundtracks, sure, why not?
569020	572740	You know, you can look up what songs are going to be on there, and, you know, it has a great
572740	576820	soundtrack like, you know, all the other Grand Theft Auto games, so.
576820	577820	I'm fine with that.
577820	580220	I'll look at the track list, that's not spoiling anything for me.
580220	581220	That's not a big deal.
581940	585620	Yeah, I'm not going to look up any of the, you know, cutscene audio stuff, I'm not going
585620	586620	to listen to any of that.
586620	587620	Good for you.
587620	592700	You know, just, we're just too close to coming out to spoil myself on some of the stuff in
592700	593700	the game.
593700	594700	Good for you.
594700	597220	You know, like Easter eggs and stuff, that's a whole different thing, you know, I'll look
597220	599300	that stuff up, because it's fun, but.
599300	602820	Alright, well I know you are very much looking forward to Grand Theft Auto 5, what's the
602820	603820	big day again?
603820	604820	We're about three weeks out.
604820	605820	17th.
605820	606820	Four weeks out.
606820	609060	17th, but I'm hoping to get that Friday before.
609060	610060	Using your connections.
610060	611060	Alright.
611900	612900	I need it.
612900	616060	We'll get into what we've been playing this week, but I do have a few other topics I want
616060	618300	to address here at the top of the show.
618300	624040	First off, I do want to say a big hello and hi to the regular listeners that we have every
624040	625040	week for one.
625040	628780	We have a great crowd of folks that turn up here live every week, and you know, I mentioned
628780	632200	some of the chatters earlier, and those of you guys that turn out here Sunday night,
632200	637160	and I know a lot of you guys listen to us throughout the week, be it on the iTunes podcast
637160	643640	app, Stitcher Radio, TuneIn app, or whatever app you happen to be using, a big thank you
643640	645160	for listening to us there.
645160	649460	But I also want to say hello to anyone we might have met at Dragon Con, because I just
649460	652440	realized this is the show that will be on the feed, because we're not going to be here
652440	655800	live next week, because I'm going to be in Atlanta at Dragon Con, and several people
655800	660000	will be at PAX, Dragon Con, there's other, like here in Sacramento, they're having a
660000	661000	big anime convention.
661000	662000	SchoolCon.
662000	666000	Yeah, a lot of people get ready for school, so there's just so much going on this weekend.
666000	671600	We will not be here Sunday night, so this will be the show that anybody I meet at Dragon
671600	674840	Con hears, to kind of listen to the show.
674840	679540	So a big hello to anybody I might have networked with at Dragon Con.
679540	684420	If you are listening before Labor Day weekend, and you are going to Dragon Con, please come
684420	685620	say hello.
685620	686880	We're all super approachable.
686880	688800	We would love to meet listeners.
688800	693520	I've met a variety of listeners at PAX East, and E3, and PAX Prime, and whatever other
693520	698920	conventions I've been at, ASEN, so forth, so I would love to meet more at Dragon Con.
698920	701240	You get three opportunities now.
701240	706480	The folks at Dragon Con have been wonderful in just kind of helping us get involved.
706480	713400	So Saturday night, 5.30, at the Hilton, 2.03, the VOG Super Show, where several of us from
713400	717360	VOG are going to get together to talk about the story about VOG Network, and talk about
717360	722100	what it's like to have been podcasting for so long, and where we see our future is going,
722100	725260	and maybe we have a surprise announcement in store.
725260	728420	We'll be recording that, because that would be kind of cool to record that.
728420	733100	We will be recording that, and Bobby will be putting it on his feed later on, so that
733100	734100	will be awesome.
734100	737100	Yes, Bobby Black Wolf says hello to people in the future.
737100	741140	That is literally what I'm doing right now, saying hello to the future people, the tomorrow
741140	742140	people.
742140	746260	Of course, you know, I'd have to give you my little contribution on the whole thing,
746260	751340	and that would be sitting in the middle of my classroom, in my portfolio class, using
751340	756240	that time to work on logo, and my teacher being perfectly fine with it, because it was
756240	758660	all stuff that was going to go in my portfolio.
758660	762020	You know what I'll do for you, Dark Sakura, is at the panel to kind of make it like you
762020	763020	were there.
763020	768020	Just every 30 seconds or so, I'll just go, ah-ha, ah-ha, ah-ha, ah-ha, ah-ha, ah-ha,
768020	769020	ah-ha.
769020	770020	No.
770020	771020	I'm just kidding.
771020	772020	Don't sound like that.
772020	773020	I'm just being a jerk.
773020	774020	All right.
774020	775020	No.
775020	776020	You're being a bitch.
776020	778960	In all seriousness, giving Jamie a hard time.
778960	783200	In all seriousness, though, on Sunday, we're going to be a part of the Parsec Awards.
783200	786740	We have been honored to be asked to be a part of that.
786740	790740	So it's going to be like, I don't know, it's going to be like I'm on stage at the Oscars
790740	792960	giving an award, although it's on a much different scale.
792960	793960	Wear a swan dress.
793960	794960	That's what you should do.
794960	795960	If I had more time.
795960	798880	You need to wear a swan dress with an egg.
798880	799880	I would.
799880	800880	You know what?
800880	802560	I would sit on Travis's lap and lay an egg.
802560	803560	No.
803560	804560	You know what we need to do?
804560	805560	What?
805560	811200	We need to do like an airbrush place that does t-shirts and have them make you a swan.
811200	812200	Okay.
812200	813200	You've got 48 hours.
813200	814200	You know what?
814200	816560	I've had one done in an hour, so you can get a swan.
816560	817560	I'll draw you a swan.
817560	818560	That would be awesome.
818560	819560	A swan dress t-shirt.
819560	821560	That could be pretty sweet.
821560	822560	Pretty sweet.
822560	823560	All right.
823560	824560	But anyway.
824560	825560	You can meet Bjork.
825560	826560	So that will be that.
826560	827560	We are presenting one of the awards towards the end of the ceremony.
827560	833360	And then on Monday, there's a panel about live streaming and about doing live streams
833360	834360	and so forth.
834360	835360	Bobby's on the panel.
835360	838960	He's just going to support and as somebody who does a lot of live streaming himself through
838960	842620	this show, through game streaming and so forth.
842620	843700	And that'll be a good time.
843700	848080	That's Monday at 11, 1130 in the morning.
848080	849080	Just look for the streaming.
849080	850080	At something in the morning.
850080	851080	At something in the morning.
851080	852280	And let's just put it this way.
852280	856880	It'll be a miracle that I'm awake because I'll probably still be on the West Coast clock
856880	860680	and on convention sleep, it'll be a miracle that I'm awake.
860680	861680	Oh, boo hoo.
861680	862680	I know, right?
862680	863680	Eight o'clock in the morning.
863680	864680	On convention.
864840	865840	That's so early.
865840	867520	On convention time though.
867520	872560	Oh my gosh, I, I've already been told about all the drinks I'm going to be made to consume.
872560	874440	Let's hope I don't end up in the hospital for heaven's sake.
874440	878480	If I could make it to a morning where I actually woke up as late as eight o'clock, that would
878480	879480	be a miracle.
879480	880480	Okay.
880480	881480	Like I'm kind of dry.
881480	884880	I know I might sound peppy today because you know, there's a lot of things to be excited
884880	885880	about.
885880	889680	But last night, thanks to traffic, we went to San Francisco last night and didn't get
889680	893520	back home because of traffic until three in the morning.
894520	900680	No, there was construction on highway 80 where they were reducing it down to one lane.
900680	904520	Every asshole has to speed up as far as they can to the last minute to merge in.
904520	907040	Well, they were also putting up warnings that the Bay Bridge was going to be closed during
907040	908040	the next week.
908040	909040	That's not even, that's not even it though.
909040	910040	So what is it?
910040	915180	Is this like, like national or I don't know, like California state, you know, repave your
915180	920040	street month or something because everybody is repaving the goddamn street.
920040	921040	Everybody.
921040	925040	Everybody is doing it all like the last couple of weeks.
925040	926040	Hmm.
926040	927040	Yeah.
927040	928040	There's, there's a lot of construction.
928040	929640	So anyway, listeners don't care about that.
929640	930880	Uh, but dragon con.
930880	931880	Yes.
931880	934840	So things going on Saturday, Sunday, Monday, if you want to follow me on Twitter, I'll
934840	939520	post updates about where I'm at provided my phone has a charge twitter.com slash sky S
939520	940520	K I E.
940520	941520	That's my personal Twitter.
941520	946600	Uh, so you can follow me there and get your dragon con updates, uh, dark soccer, Loki,
946600	950040	sadly not coming with me to dragon con, but I know we'll be following the news from packs
950040	951040	at home.
951040	952040	And I'm going to school con.
952040	953040	Are you?
953040	954040	Well, that's good.
954040	956160	I'm actually dropping the class and taking another class.
956160	958440	I'm surprised you're not going to go to sack anime at least for a day.
958440	959440	Just check it out.
959440	960440	Rob.
960440	961440	Sack anime costs money.
961440	962440	Guess who doesn't have a job.
962440	963440	That's true.
963440	964720	You can't, can't pull media strings.
964720	968040	It was actually, I tried, it's too, too late.
968040	970760	Don't I'm trying to get us in for a panel next con.
970760	971760	Yes.
971760	972760	Yes, please.
972760	973760	I would totally Skype in.
973760	974760	I begged.
974760	977960	I know how con con wifi con wifi is a pain in the ass.
977960	980520	We'd love to have you, but that's why we're not live streaming.
980520	983320	If you want to know why we aren't live streaming the panel, especially when we have big news
983320	987600	to talk about, uh, that's why, because you cannot depend on hotel wifi, even though I'm
987600	991080	sure they bring in the Uber stuff for dragon con, which is a huge deal.
991080	992080	So anyway, yes.
992080	993080	Dragon con.
993080	994840	The other thing I want to talk about at the top of the show before we get into our gaming
994840	999120	weeks, I guess this is a little bit about our gaming weeks, but, um, I, I don't know
999120	1002840	if dark soccer has been playing this this weekend, but, uh, the early launch for final
1002840	1006000	fantasy 14 started on Friday.
1006040	1009640	And, uh, I know we talked about this game at length last week, so I don't want to draw
1009640	1015240	this out too much, but lot of problems going on with final fantasy 14 launch, which is
1015240	1019400	really unfortunate, but, uh, they're having some severe network issues.
1019400	1023320	Once you get in the game, it's a fairly pleasant experience, except for the fact that the first
1023320	1028640	day instances weren't working, which usually most MMOs isn't a big deal, except in final
1028640	1033680	fantasy 14, you have story instances you have to do about every five levels and you go into
1033680	1038480	solo instances and beat them, which is fun and it, you know, it, it helps you learn about
1038480	1039480	your character and so forth.
1039480	1042880	But when the instance finders down, that really sucks because you can't progress your character
1042880	1046560	past like level 10 unless you had a character who was already higher levels.
1046560	1050160	So, and don't forget about the fates lasting like four times as long as normal.
1050160	1051160	Yeah.
1051160	1053320	So it's just, it's just a lot of experience.
1053320	1054440	So that was day one.
1054440	1058640	Well today they fixed it, but they did it by severely limiting how many people could
1058640	1059860	log into the game.
1059860	1063820	So so many people like you'll get, you'll get to the log on screen, you hit the button
1063820	1067980	and this, uh, server full, can't get in, server full, can't get in, server full, like over
1067980	1068980	and over and over again.
1068980	1070460	I've seen people complaining about this on Twitter.
1070460	1074340	I sat there for 15 minutes, hammering the button and I finally got in and I played for
1074340	1078440	like four hours cause I'm like, once I'm in, I'm not leaving.
1078440	1083180	But the reason why I bring this up, it's not like every MMO doesn't have their share of
1083180	1084180	problems.
1084180	1086460	I'm not defending final fantasy 14 in this regard.
1086460	1088460	I will say it's a great game.
1088460	1092340	Once you get in there and get past all this bullshit, I'm having a great time.
1092340	1099040	However, it really sucks that these network issues are taking away that attention from
1099040	1104060	what is otherwise a great game and it really sucks that Square Enix wasn't a little better
1104060	1109460	prepared for it, which every MMO has the same damn story.
1109460	1113660	Every MMO has the same exact story when it comes to launching and servers being offline
1113660	1114660	stuff.
1114660	1119860	Why did Microsoft think that they're going to be different with their whole online tie
1119860	1122380	to, you know, consoles and stuff?
1122380	1125700	Oh no, no, everybody's going to screw that up, but we won't.
1125700	1126700	We won't screw it up.
1126700	1127700	Microsoft?
1127700	1132780	Well, yeah, cause he's saying with the Xbox one, you know, and we were saying at the time
1132780	1135980	we said, look at what happened to Diablo three, look at what happened to SimCity.
1135980	1139140	Well just add Final Fantasy 14 to that list.
1139140	1144140	SimCity, perfect example of like, well, we saw what happened with Diablo three and we're
1144140	1146600	taking precautions to make sure that it doesn't happen.
1146600	1149980	And it's like, you just cursed yourself, you stupid idiot.
1149980	1153380	No matter who you are, these situations are going to keep happening.
1153380	1159140	I mean the first Final Fantasy 14 version 1.0 was such a stinker that they probably
1159140	1163180	were legitimately not expecting this many people from North America to give it a second
1163180	1164180	chance.
1164180	1168020	I think it's amazing and speaks to the quality of the game that people are giving it a second
1168020	1169500	chance.
1169500	1174940	But uh, some people like, um, do you guys know who Chris Cluey is?
1174940	1175940	He's that guy.
1175940	1179100	He used to be a punter for the Vikings and now I think he's with the Raiders.
1179100	1180100	That's sports ball.
1180100	1183420	Well, but he's a very big advocate for gay rights in the NFL.
1183420	1186460	He's not gay himself, but he's a huge advocate for gay rights is when I've gone on Ellen
1186460	1189060	and all this and he's a Warcraft player.
1189060	1193660	So he's, you know, he's a great guy and you know, is, is also a nerd as well as doing
1193660	1195860	sports ball for a living and sticks up for all this stuff.
1195900	1200100	Well, he was writing these tweets this weekend, very angry and he was so mad.
1200100	1204340	He couldn't even redeem his code for Final Fantasy 14 that he did a charge back on buying
1204340	1205340	the game.
1205340	1209700	You know, it's, yeah, I know it's kind of a dick thing to do, but I get it.
1209700	1212580	But there's probably a lot of people out there that are feeling kind of ripped off and it
1212580	1214820	kind of, it really sucks.
1214820	1218680	So what do you think gaming companies can do about these network issues?
1218680	1225300	Because I understand the concern that, well, if they, let's say they put up a hundred servers.
1225340	1229740	OK, great. So for 30 days, you have a hundred servers running rocking full of people and
1229740	1232580	then it dies off totally completely.
1233100	1234180	Well, how do we get around that?
1234180	1238740	That's the thing is that's why Microsoft's pushing the whole Azure server thing.
1238980	1240420	It's basically virtual servers.
1240420	1245340	So they they can scale them back pretty fast or scale or virtual.
1245540	1249500	Yeah, virtual servers. So basically you can scale them back pretty fast when it does die
1249500	1252060	off instead of having all this hardware that they're running.
1252220	1253820	You know, they're running a bunch of virtual machines.
1253820	1255980	And so there's that.
1256420	1260660	So maybe something like that would help, you know, and then that way.
1261820	1266580	Because I mean, it's it's a hard balancing game because you can you don't want to buy too
1266580	1272580	many servers or have too many of them running because you're not going to need them past
1272580	1274860	launch once that kind of evens out.
1275140	1279940	So you deal with, you know, spending less money up front and having people kind of be a
1279940	1284100	little bit pissed about it for two weeks and then, you know, leveling off and everybody
1284100	1285100	kind of forgetting about it.
1286660	1289180	Or you spend a lot of money and have everybody be happy.
1289180	1293940	But you're out all that extra money up to wait a lot longer before you recoup that.
1293940	1298820	Yeah, yeah. The Old Republic, huge example of some of that where, you know, even even
1298820	1303420	though they had a million servers, still they had the lines queuing up and still they had
1303420	1304500	a big mess as well.
1304500	1308620	But it calmed down after a couple of days and then interest in the game just tanked as
1308620	1310020	people's 30 day period ran out.
1310020	1316020	I mean, it still has had its fans and still has its fans, but not enough to necessitate all
1316020	1317340	the servers that game had.
1317340	1320860	And it was like a lot of servers went very ghost town, which was very sad.
1321060	1326900	Yeah, I think what has to happen is that a lot of MMOs at this point really need to kind of
1326900	1332820	challenge themselves on the multiple server way of thinking that a lot of MMOs do.
1333060	1337460	And I see some MMOs and I think Guild Wars and I'm even thinking back to the original
1337460	1341740	Guild Wars is a great example of this kind of has the and you see Warcraft moving towards
1341740	1345260	this, too, with their whole servers that they're talking about, the virtual servers where we
1345260	1348580	need to really like you might be on a different box.
1348700	1352180	You might be playing on a different machine, but it's one world.
1352340	1353500	It's one world.
1353500	1358780	And you are phased to the people that you want to play with and so forth like Guild Wars
1358780	1362860	did this. You go into the city and you could pick which one of the 50 different copies of
1362860	1363900	the city do you want to be in.
1363900	1366140	And then when you go out in the world, you're in your own little instance.
1366260	1370260	And I think that was a good way to kind of challenge the traditional you're on your server and
1370260	1371300	you don't leave those servers.
1371300	1374380	And if you want to change servers, twenty five bucks kind of way of thinking.
1374820	1379300	Well, that's just dumb anyways, because, I mean, what is copying a file across the server?
1379340	1380500	Well, that's World of Warcraft.
1380500	1381540	That's World of Warcraft right now.
1381540	1385660	It's just like it's like charging a seventy five dollars to put a cabin air filter in.
1385820	1387100	It takes like one second.
1388020	1391940	I hated the cross server instance as well, which is one of the big reasons I quit.
1392500	1395260	Hated it. I would rather be on one server.
1395700	1397980	With the people who I know are on one server.
1398980	1401980	But what if you have that one friend who's on another server?
1401980	1404620	I mean, the way WoW does it, I like that.
1404620	1407420	I hated when you're out in the world and it cross server.
1408140	1410180	Yeah, I loathed it.
1410180	1412060	Yeah, that screwed up the crafting.
1412060	1414100	But anyway, I don't want to screw up everything.
1414260	1418260	I don't want to get too much into the WoW talk because, you know, I already have another show
1418260	1420660	for a lot of that. But I think this MMO stuff is good.
1420660	1425020	If I wanted to play cross server, it was with someone I knew I could choose to play with
1425020	1426540	somebody I wanted to play with.
1426540	1431940	Right. They really need they just need to put out the server server program or whatever for
1431940	1433820	Final Fantasy 11. Just let it go.
1434220	1436900	You are dying to hack the crap out of that game.
1436900	1440380	I just want to play that game because it's free to play with would have been awesome for
1440380	1443300	that because it's got to go free to play or close pretty soon.
1443300	1444660	I mean, we'll see.
1445620	1447180	They just released an expansion.
1447340	1450820	The very last PlayStation two game ever made was a Final Fantasy 11 expansion.
1451100	1453820	Just they have to technically.
1454660	1457020	They don't have to do shit.
1457020	1457980	They have to do that.
1458380	1459700	They don't have to do a damn thing.
1460780	1462820	They have to die and pay taxes.
1462820	1465540	That's it. Anyhow.
1465700	1467940	Even then, you know, corporations get out of the tax.
1469940	1475180	All right. Let's get into how is your gaming week and specifically what types of games have
1475180	1477660	you been playing this week besides 14 and all that?
1477660	1478740	What other games have you been playing?
1478740	1482740	Dark Sakura, Fractal, Dragon Age 2, Mass Effect 3 and
1484180	1485500	Yeah, and Animal Crossing.
1485660	1488220	Is there something going on with a Dragon Age Renaissance?
1488220	1490660	Because Alan's been really into Dragon Age this week, too.
1490900	1494980	I just decided to finally finish Dragon Age 2 and I hate Anders.
1495740	1500340	And Fenris was a dick, too, but he was at least pretty.
1501380	1504940	And and he does get kind of better and he actually has a reason for being a dick.
1506220	1510460	And yeah, I wasn't super impressed with it.
1510460	1513620	It was OK. I might go back and play Origins and Awakenings.
1513620	1518460	But I just wanted to finish it that and, you know, while there was server maintenance going
1518460	1520100	on, I was like, OK, I'll just play something else.
1520420	1522980	I really didn't care. I haven't had the energy to care.
1523620	1525380	So it's like one thing goes down.
1525380	1527420	Well, it's not like I don't have 50,000 other things to play.
1527420	1529940	And that's that's the way a lot of people should look at it.
1530140	1533580	And not to dig up the old topic we just left.
1533580	1539300	But I will say, like most things in gaming, a month from now, who's going to remember all
1539300	1541780	this fuckery? Very few people.
1541780	1545460	Well, we'll still remember it, but we won't be angry.
1545460	1547580	We'll be past it because you'll be busy playing the game.
1547700	1550140	Like, remember when PlayStation three was hacked?
1550780	1555860	Remember when Xbox 360 took all those people's money through the EA games?
1556260	1560900	Remember all these things that happened that we just kind of remember when they knew it
1560900	1562420	just red ring? Yeah.
1563940	1568260	Remember when Diablo three launched and it was shit like, hey, speaking of which, Diablo
1568260	1571300	three launches in the console a couple of weeks.
1571380	1573420	How do you think that's going to do? I don't think it's going to do very well.
1573420	1574980	I don't see you pretty popular so far.
1575300	1576940	There's not a whole ton coming out in September.
1576940	1582460	Remember, there's Grand Theft Auto and then FIFA and Diablo.
1582460	1583900	I mean, that's pretty much it.
1585100	1590020	Rayman, I guess. But I think it's probably going to be the second biggest game of the
1590020	1594180	month. Jamie, was there anything else you want to say about your gaming week?
1595020	1597460	Not really. Sorry, I didn't mean to deviate from it too much.
1597460	1598860	But you were having a sneezy.
1598860	1602340	No, I'm actually I think something might have set off my allergies worse.
1602860	1604940	I hope it wasn't the kitty. I don't think it's kitty.
1605260	1606340	Can't be anything in here.
1606940	1608860	Was it the stuff I used to vacuum earlier?
1608860	1612540	Maybe I don't know, but it's like it's now getting into my eyes.
1612900	1616020	Feel better if you need to go outside for a minute or something to do it.
1616140	1618140	I think going outside will make it worse, make it worse.
1618300	1621820	Yeah, I didn't start to feel better at home until I turned on the AC and filtered
1621820	1625980	everything. I'm going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.
1626020	1629140	Fifth Dream says, I want the Diablo three expansion a lot.
1629140	1630460	You know, we'll be talking about that in a little bit.
1630700	1633420	Dungeon Buster says, the trailer for that looks nice.
1634020	1638100	Code Man says, never forget Final Fantasy 14, A Realm Reborn.
1638340	1641660	Well, honestly, Code Man, you could probably insert any other MMO in there.
1641660	1643620	Every MMO, every single one of them.
1643620	1645020	Never forget Ragnarok Online.
1645020	1649900	And Square Enix will probably want you to forget about Final Fantasy 14, take one.
1650220	1654940	Exactly. The smoothest MMO launch I probably played was probably
1655860	1658220	actually Guild Wars 2. I will give them credit.
1658380	1662220	That was a pretty smooth launch, but it still had its share of problems.
1662380	1665300	Defiance wasn't so bad, but that's also because no one was playing it.
1667260	1668940	All right, Loki, how was your gaming week?
1669740	1671780	I only played Saints Row 4 this week.
1672580	1676540	I actually started off playing the Xbox 360 version, but then once my Steam
1677100	1680300	version unlocked, I just went ahead and finished up and played on that.
1680300	1683380	And I'm pretty much I'm almost 100 percent complete.
1684380	1687740	I have just one mission left, so I've been finishing up all the activities
1688020	1690180	and I'm almost golden everything.
1690180	1694060	I have all the collectibles collected and I have
1695100	1696540	almost all the activities done.
1696540	1699140	I have a few more that have the gold that had silver on,
1699140	1701500	but I'll probably be done with it today.
1703140	1705220	Which brings me to
1705220	1709340	more about the game and kind of a little pseudo reveal review, if you will.
1709340	1714140	Well, I keep hearing people refer to Saints Row 4 as
1715020	1717980	the love letter written to Saints Row fans.
1718820	1722140	But the problem is, though, this game,
1722500	1725740	the only thing that seems to be coming out of it is like all these cool
1726060	1730180	like in the very beginning, the missions kind of were lame and it kind of sucked.
1730540	1734980	And then as you get to the point where you're finding more of your crew members
1734980	1737580	on, you know, you're taking them out of the simulation
1737580	1740860	and you're starting to do the loyalty missions and stuff,
1740860	1742780	it's where they start actually getting pretty creative
1742780	1744300	with the actual missions and stuff.
1744300	1746140	And there's some pretty funny stuff in there.
1746140	1751940	There is one with Asha where it's a whole rip on Metal Gear Solid.
1752220	1754580	And so there's, you know, the
1755660	1758820	the whole point in there is like, OK, in this section,
1758900	1761100	we're going to need to shoot at the lights
1761100	1763580	and then we're going to have to take out the guard. OK.
1764060	1766340	All right. Now this is going to be completely different.
1766580	1769900	What I'm going to need you to do is I need you to shoot at the lights
1769900	1772700	and take it. It's kind of funny. I like that.
1773140	1775340	And then some of the there is a mission with
1776580	1780540	Pierce, where they do like a duet with
1782140	1787540	the song. Opposites attract or whatever.
1787900	1790140	Oh, the Paul Abdul song. Yes, Paul Abdul.
1790140	1793700	So they did that. And they also sing some other songs on the radio.
1794060	1796300	But it's like that part right there kind of makes me smile
1796300	1800660	because that's the part where they're kind of getting down to like
1800660	1803460	what made the games good is like the personality in the game.
1803700	1808220	But a lot of the throughout the whole missions and stuff that this love letter
1808220	1812220	to the fans is basically like, hey, remember how cool Saints Row 2 was?
1813020	1816060	And that's it. It's like, hey, remember how cool Saints Row 2 was?
1816180	1817340	Hey, remember this guy?
1817340	1821180	Remember how you really did like this really fucked up thing to like get him back?
1821340	1823780	Remember how crazy shit was back in that?
1825100	1828580	That's it. It's if you wanted to write a love letter to the fans,
1828580	1833900	you would make a game that outperformed Saints Row 2 in every single way,
1833900	1838580	because Saints Row 2 hit that wonderful balance of crazy and grounded,
1838740	1841260	where, yes, you didn't have superpowers and stuff,
1841260	1844260	but there was a very compelling storyline to it.
1844460	1847700	And it was crazy and quirky enough that where it was enjoyable.
1847860	1852420	Then three went full retard and just, you know, how do you go from there?
1852620	1856060	Their idea was, hey, let's make it even crazier.
1856260	1859260	We'll put in a virtual simulation and we'll give you superpowers.
1859260	1861460	Well, that's kind of cool at first.
1861780	1864860	But then you realize that all these cool weapons that they developed,
1864980	1867380	you know, that you can use in the game are kind of useless
1867380	1869780	and they end up using the same weapons over and over.
1870700	1873100	Or they're just reskins of weapons that were in other games.
1873100	1876780	And also, what's up with, you know, them saying, hey,
1876860	1879540	we're not going to have these missions where we're basically going to have you
1879540	1881580	do the activities and kind of force you to do that.
1881700	1883060	No, actually, all that's in there.
1883060	1886300	In fact, the last bits of the loyalty missions that you have to do
1886300	1889660	for your crew members are all the fucking activities in the game.
1889740	1890580	That's all it is.
1890580	1892620	They didn't even bother to think of new missions.
1892780	1895660	They just like, hey, do this fucking activity because we developed it.
1895660	1898860	And the fact that they're basing a lot of these activities off of,
1898860	1901860	was it cyber blazing, which was in Saints Row the third,
1902580	1905940	which I think was the worst activity in the whole fucking game.
1906100	1908460	And now they have a whole bunch based off of that.
1908460	1910300	It's just kind of annoying.
1910300	1911820	But the game is still good.
1911820	1914500	It's just it's sad because
1914500	1918420	they remind you about how great the series was.
1918420	1921860	And there are some moments that are still great, but it's kind of
1922860	1924780	it's kind of like just going through the paces again.
1924780	1927140	They're not really.
1928460	1932420	They're not trying too hard, it seems like, because it's the same world.
1932540	1933940	It's based off the same engine.
1933940	1936660	Yeah, they tweaked some stuff, but the superpowers are fucking from the
1937500	1941580	they were from the expansion for Saints Row the third, Saints Row the third.
1941700	1944020	The superpowers were from troubled clones.
1944580	1945820	They're exactly the same.
1945820	1948020	They just kind of built upon that.
1948460	1949700	That's my problem with it.
1949700	1953140	It's just I don't see I mean, there's going to be replayability
1953140	1956180	because I know the PC version and the modding community
1956180	1957580	is going to be great on it and stuff.
1957580	1959940	And it's it's just been out for a little bit.
1959940	1962620	And they already have some pretty cool stuff available already. But
1964140	1967420	story wise, I hope the last mission is really good.
1967460	1969020	That's what I'm hoping.
1969020	1971620	But I just think it's going to be kind of a letdown.
1971700	1973660	Thank God they brought Gat back, because that
1974580	1977100	it's very clear when you once you rescue him
1977100	1979780	and you actually playing with him and some of the other missions.
1979860	1981860	It's like, why the hell did they kill that guy off?
1981860	1984300	And the way they explained how he came back is brilliant.
1984300	1987100	I like that. But it was just
1988380	1991940	once again, it's like, OK, he was a great part of Saints Row two.
1992860	1997020	And. You know, that's kind of why you need him back in the game, because
1998540	2001740	it's going to be hard to figure out where they go for the fifth game from here.
2001740	2002860	They're going to have to scale it back,
2002860	2004980	and I hope that they find a happy medium with number two.
2004980	2008100	When I'm listening to you kind of talk about your disappointment with it,
2008100	2011940	I almost feel like you're saying that you kind of feel like it's still,
2011980	2014660	you know, a lot of people were razzing the whole fact that it's
2014660	2018740	it was an expansion turned into a full game and that, oh, my gosh,
2018740	2019940	it's not really going to be a full game.
2019980	2024420	Most people I've heard talk about it say that was really unfounded
2024620	2027220	because they really did all this different stuff with the game.
2027220	2028500	And you do get that full game experience.
2028500	2032660	But the way you talk about it, you make it sound like it is more of an expansion.
2032700	2037100	It does seem like I mean, there's a lot of there's content in there.
2037900	2039940	There's missions that are pretty unique.
2039940	2043660	And, you know, I'll give them that because and they do stand out quite
2044460	2046020	well from everything else.
2046020	2052220	But a lot of it is just kind of in there, just just because, like, you know.
2055220	2058900	A lot of the stuff that they explain in the game is because of the you have
2058900	2062860	that you were hacking the simulation, but like the the mini games in there
2062860	2066900	and the activities that they have you do kind of don't make any sense.
2067540	2070060	I mean, and yeah, I understand it's not supposed to make a ton of sense,
2070060	2074300	but it really doesn't make any sense why it's in there other than it's a thing to do.
2074620	2079380	You know, like, why do I have to go in the simulation and throw balls at targets?
2079420	2083740	You know, or why do why do I have to why do I have to run along this path
2083740	2085660	and collect glowing orbs and stuff?
2085660	2087180	You know, why do I have to?
2087180	2089020	Why not? It worked in Crackdown.
2089020	2094580	Exactly. And that's the problem, too, is they took so much inspiration,
2094580	2095700	if you will, from Crackdown.
2095700	2097580	It's fucking Crackdown.
2097580	2098940	It's got the super powers.
2098940	2100340	What's the problem with that?
2100340	2102020	Everybody wants another Crackdown.
2102020	2103460	It got pretty boring after all.
2103460	2106060	Crackdown didn't really have a single player narrative to it.
2106060	2109620	There wasn't. It was basically like a go here, kill guy, go here, kill guy.
2109740	2112100	And that's fine, you know, and they have some of that.
2112100	2115140	But like some of the stuff that they took from three to try to bring it over,
2115340	2116740	like they just shoehorned it in there.
2116740	2118180	Like you have to steal.
2118180	2123020	You have the auto theft stuff where you have to go jack a car and bring it back.
2123340	2127020	You know, there's the chop shop stuff, but it's because it has a virus on it
2127020	2130700	or you have to kill this guy because he's a virus or it's like, come on.
2130820	2131620	It's ridiculous.
2131860	2135660	So to bring this back a little bit and try to try to wrap up this conversation,
2136460	2139300	the only thing that strikes me as funny is that even though you're kind of giving
2139300	2140740	I know you're a huge fan of Saints Row,
2140740	2142340	and even though you're kind of giving me the impression
2142340	2147220	you're giving this a negative review here, you've played to 93 percent completion.
2147220	2150060	So there must be something you really like about this.
2150060	2153300	I like the game and I want to get it done with so I can play Grand Theft Auto five.
2153300	2155980	And so I got to finish it before Grand Theft Auto five comes out.
2155980	2157020	Get this out of here.
2157020	2161060	It's sad. I like the game, but it's just
2161460	2163500	it feels very rushed.
2163500	2168180	And I know that, you know, the team that evolutions great and they worked on stuff.
2168180	2173460	But I feel that they've done so much better work in the past that come on.
2173740	2177580	There should be no excuse for this kind of stuff. And, you know,
2179700	2180420	I just don't know.
2180420	2184580	It's just it's very like I understand what they were trying to do with it,
2184580	2188220	but it's just doesn't like maybe it's at the point now where they're like, well,
2188420	2191660	crap, we've got to go crazier for the fourth game.
2192380	2194740	How do we do that? Oh, we're going to do superpowers.
2194740	2197860	OK, now. And then it's like, OK, well, we got to think of a new weapon.
2197860	2201220	It's got to be really crazy because people are expecting crazy.
2201740	2204780	And that's the problem is I think they've gotten stuck in that now where
2204940	2208700	everything has to be so over the top and like, oh, it's a cliche of this.
2208700	2210620	Oh, it's a play on that.
2210620	2213620	Just I think what they need to do is it's going to be interesting
2213620	2215900	when they have that expansion, the first expansion come out,
2215900	2218700	because they did something similar with Skyrim.
2218700	2221900	The Skyrim team did where it's like, OK, here's a week develop something
2221900	2224940	that you want to do and we'll put it in the game later on,
2224940	2226380	or we'll try to figure out a way for it.
2226380	2229380	And that's where a lot of the great content from Skyrim came from
2229380	2233060	was that that kind of like almost like internal game jam type thing. Yeah.
2233100	2235540	And I really wish that that's what they would do for the fifth game
2235540	2238660	where just put some good ideas together would have been really cool
2239260	2241420	for number four, because it is a simulation.
2241860	2245380	Take chunks from Saints like Stillwater and Steelport
2245380	2247140	and just mash it all together.
2247140	2250380	Just like take shit from, you know, that old map and the, you know,
2250380	2253540	Steelport map that would have at least made it different and interesting
2253740	2256420	as opposed to just, OK, we're just going to dump the same app in there
2256420	2258980	and throw some alien shit in the air and call it a day.
2259420	2262500	All right. Going to our chat room with some comments live.vognetwork.com
2262540	2266300	Shadownextgen says the homages in Saints Row four are amazing.
2267340	2271220	Fifth Dream says Saints Row four needs tiny Tina's assault on Dragon Keep
2271220	2272980	merged with Blood Dragon.
2272980	2274220	That'll be some epic DLC.
2274220	2277100	And Act Def says Loki should write a response review on VOG
2277100	2278220	if he hasn't already.
2278220	2280900	Bobby Bobby said his piece on vognetwork.com.
2281260	2283580	So I still have to finish the game, so I can't write a review yet.
2283620	2286340	I haven't finished. I haven't done the last mission yet. Fair enough.
2286340	2290020	I'm hoping that it just, you know, brings it all back, you know, but we'll see.
2290140	2293580	All right. One other question I have to ask, and I'll give this
2293580	2294900	little shout out here.
2294900	2298660	I was listening to my friends over on the video game realness podcast,
2298660	2301420	which is a fun show, and I think they tweeted you guys this week.
2301580	2303620	But they were talking about Saints Row four.
2303820	2307900	And one of the hosts was was just downright giddy
2307900	2310380	that you could dress your character up as She-Ra. Is that true?
2311420	2314340	I don't know if you can do She-Ra, but I know that they have the Rainbow
2314340	2315220	Bright costume.
2317100	2318540	That's pretty amazing as well.
2318540	2323860	But they do have like the the Thundercats, you know, thing where it's like, oh,
2323900	2326060	that's what I love. Oh, oh, I'm sorry.
2326500	2328380	Go ahead. One other real quick gripe.
2328380	2330860	And this goes back to just game design and everything.
2331340	2334900	They have like three different things that are assigned to the left
2334900	2336180	and right directional pad.
2336700	2340100	Left and right directional pad are for selecting your,
2340740	2343780	you know, abilities, your super abilities that you're using.
2344500	2347780	Also for changing your radio station
2347780	2351380	and also for doing a taunt or, you know, compliment.
2352020	2354540	All of those have to do is like touch the button,
2354620	2357220	hold the button for a little bit or hold the button for a long time.
2357220	2359020	It's fucking stupid.
2359020	2361820	It's because like half the time, oh, I'm trying to do a taunt.
2361940	2363700	Oh, I'm sorry. I changed the radio station.
2363700	2365380	Oh, no, I changed my superpower.
2365380	2368140	It's like dumb. That is completely stupid.
2368700	2370380	All right. But they have a lot of this.
2370380	2373580	That's what I really love about Saints Row is all this over the top shit.
2373580	2375220	And so I need to check it out.
2375220	2377220	So they do have a lot of cool costumes in there.
2377220	2380700	So it'll be interesting to see what other stuff that they add on with DLC.
2380700	2382620	So far, they haven't gone crazy yet. All right.
2383180	2385140	I'll quickly talk about my gaming week.
2385140	2387820	I've already talked ad nauseam about Final Fantasy 14,
2387820	2390260	which honestly has been the majority of my time as the game is new.
2390500	2394100	But there is at least one other game I checked out this week on PlayStation
2394100	2396420	three, and this was partially a listener recommendation.
2396420	2398340	I want to say I don't remember who it was.
2398340	2400620	I don't remember who was in chat or an email. I apologize.
2400620	2403180	I just remember seeing it on the store and I was like, oh, yeah,
2403180	2404740	somebody told me I should get that and play that.
2404740	2407100	So I did download Tekken Revolution,
2407420	2412060	which is the free to play Tekken game that was that's on the PlayStation three.
2412060	2414780	Now, I don't know why I had it in my mind.
2415220	2417020	That it was the Tekken card game.
2417020	2419380	I don't know why I thought that, but I did.
2419940	2421940	I downloaded it and it's totally not.
2421940	2422940	Wasn't that the PSP game?
2422940	2426100	Maybe maybe that's where I'm like crossing wires or something.
2426100	2428740	But anyway, it's not it has nothing to do with cards.
2428940	2430820	It's a straight up fighting game,
2430820	2433780	just like it was Tekken seven or something on the consoles.
2434660	2438460	But it's but it's a free to play game, which is weird.
2438460	2442460	But I, I kind of I actually really enjoyed it.
2443020	2445820	Come to think of it, you know, it was free.
2446140	2449660	And the way that they make their money is that you can play either.
2449660	2452780	I think it's like you could do five player versus player matches
2453020	2457420	or two versus computer matches before you run out of energy.
2457660	2460100	But the computer matches are like arcade style.
2460100	2462460	So if you win, you get to play again and again and again
2462460	2466020	until you get up to like a boss that you kill like seven people in.
2466380	2469220	And each time you win a match, you get a little bit of cash.
2469220	2472100	You get a little bit of experience, a little bit of these gift points.
2472420	2476220	The gift points you end up unlocking characters later on or so I hear.
2476220	2478260	I guess it takes a lot to do it because I haven't done it yet.
2479220	2481380	The money you can use to up the stats
2481380	2485260	on your character for when you go fight later matches.
2485500	2491020	So the either now I know I'm not that good at fighting games
2491020	2493660	because I was about to say either I'm really good at fighting games,
2493660	2495660	but I know that's not the case.
2495660	2498860	But I went in there and in my first time through, I picked Marshall Law
2498860	2500820	because he's one of my favorite Tekken characters.
2500820	2502300	Jamie's rolling your eyes at me.
2502300	2504540	No, I was actually just about to ask who you were using.
2504540	2507900	I use Marshall Law. OK, he's not very mashable.
2507940	2511940	But I, I beat arcade mode
2511940	2515620	my first time on normal and got like a ton of points from doing it.
2515780	2519980	When I went on hard difficulty, I actually had a little bit of issue.
2519980	2521100	I wasn't able to get as far.
2521100	2524700	But then when I did, I actually got brave and I went and did a PvP match.
2524700	2525900	Like I didn't think I was going to do it.
2525900	2527380	Oh, God, I'm going to get my ass kicked.
2527380	2529380	But actually, I will say this about the PvP match.
2529580	2533340	I got matched up against somebody who was now they ended up beating me.
2533580	2537220	But it was like a five round match because it's like two out of three.
2537220	2540660	And it went the full five rounds like they were equally matched with me.
2540660	2543860	And I was very impressed at that, especially for a free game.
2544180	2547020	So if you like fighting games
2547380	2550860	and you like Tekken, why the fuck not? It's free.
2551020	2552420	Now, here's how they get your money.
2552420	2555460	If you want to play more, you got to buy tokens
2555700	2558420	that you can use to play more matches later on.
2558660	2561740	And so, you know, so there's little ways that they nickel and dime you in that regard.
2561740	2565460	But as far as like a Facebook game on the PlayStation three,
2565460	2569180	but said Facebook game is like a Tekken six or something like that,
2569340	2571140	even though I didn't really care for Tekken six.
2571140	2574220	But, you know, I'm if Tekken six had been free,
2574220	2576460	I would have downloaded it and played it still and enjoyed it.
2576460	2579940	So, I mean, yeah, I got to say, I was
2580700	2582980	pretty impressed by this little free to play fighter.
2583540	2587620	Overall, I've been pretty impressed with the free to play offerings
2587620	2589380	on PlayStation three.
2589380	2591540	Jetpack Joyride is pretty good, too.
2591540	2593060	There's another one I checked out.
2593060	2595980	So, I mean, honestly, if you're if you're like bored
2595980	2599340	and don't really have anything to play right now or, you know, you can't
2599340	2602660	maybe can't afford to get a new game right now or just nothing looks appealing to you.
2602860	2606340	Go look at what's free on PlayStation three, because there's some pretty decent stuff.
2606460	2611260	I mean, it's not going to be like as amazing as The Last of Us
2611260	2614060	or, you know, these other big triple-A titles that are out right now.
2614060	2616100	But it'll entertain you for a little while.
2616460	2618740	Well, even if you have PlayStation Plus, it's even better.
2618740	2620580	I mean, because, yeah, well, they they announced
2620580	2623460	whether during Gamescom, Assassin's Creed three is coming out later.
2623460	2625500	This year is free. That's crazy.
2625500	2627900	This came out last year. Yeah. Crazy.
2628380	2632140	So and then, well, the Hitman game was just out last year, too. Crazy.
2632500	2634580	Thanks for the third if you haven't played it yet. Yeah.
2634580	2638380	So Shadow Next Gen in chat says, speaking of free to play,
2638380	2640580	Plants versus Zombies two is awesome.
2640580	2643740	I got to put that on my queue because I've been wanting to try that.
2643740	2645420	I haven't been able to try that yet.
2645420	2648580	So that's really the only new game I can think of to talk about
2648580	2650940	this week is Plants versus Zombies.
2650940	2653420	Excuse me. That's what the chatter can think about.
2653420	2655180	That's the only new game I can think to talk about.
2655180	2656780	Otherwise, this Tekken Revolution.
2656780	2659100	So good times. All right.
2659900	2661700	Let's move on.
2661700	2663620	Housekeeping, I pretty much already talked about
2663620	2665860	what I wanted to talk about as far as Dragon Con and so forth.
2666340	2668340	The only other thing I'll say for housekeeping is that remember
2668340	2670340	there is no live show next week.
2670340	2672860	So enjoy your week off for Labor Day, whatever you're doing.
2673620	2675500	It's a dead show next week.
2675500	2678540	And before I forget, given that we will not have a show next week,
2678540	2682380	I would like to wish my fellow individuals of the Jewish Persuasion
2683380	2684540	Happy New Year.
2684540	2686340	So there you go.
2686340	2688340	Any Labor Day greetings to give the list?
2688340	2689860	Are you going to be doing Labor Day?
2689860	2692180	Well, that time of year, you know what I mean?
2692340	2694740	My dad's birthday, I wish my dad a happy birthday.
2695300	2698060	It's the birthday, September 2nd.
2698060	2699900	You do you doing anything over the holiday?
2699900	2702220	Loki, you going to barbecue or anything?
2702220	2705980	So I got my dad's for dinner on Saturday, I think.
2705980	2707380	There you go.
2709380	2710420	That's about it.
2710420	2711780	All right. How about you, Dar Sacher?
2711780	2714060	I'm going to I'm going to be busy being Jewish.
2714820	2716540	Nothing wrong with that.
2716540	2719340	Say say hi to your synagogue friends.
2719460	2720300	To the Jew crew.
2720300	2722580	That's Dan. Dan calls them the Jew crew.
2722900	2725540	Ideally, Grantha thought a five would have leaked out by then.
2725540	2729500	But, you know, I can't make any guarantees there.
2729500	2731220	So there's some fun people in the Jew crew.
2731220	2732980	What are we getting some of them back on the show?
2732980	2736300	I don't know, but we had a really rousing game of Cards Against Humanity.
2736500	2740780	It was the first time that, except for me, that any of us had played the game.
2741420	2742340	It was very fun.
2742980	2746820	All right. And you're getting some New Year wishes back there in the chat room from
2746820	2747700	SSJ100 Matt.
2747700	2748860	Yeah, thank you.
2749340	2753420	And Yom Kippur is on the 16th and I will be busy fasting all day.
2754340	2755300	Is that on a Sunday?
2756020	2758500	No, if it was on a Sunday, I wouldn't be here.
2759340	2760420	I'll tell you in advance.
2760420	2763260	No, it's like, I don't want to put up with a Jamie who hasn't eaten.
2763740	2765020	It's actually all day on Saturday.
2765220	2766220	I think it's on a Saturday.
2766340	2767700	Okay. All right.
2768260	2770980	Anyhow. So, yeah, no show next week.
2771980	2773140	I'm at Dragon Con.
2773340	2776860	If you're going to PAX, extra fur from Horde House will be there.
2776860	2777940	So keep an eye out for him.
2778700	2784820	He will be our lone VOG representative at PAX because his partner has family in
2784820	2788700	Seattle. So that was the better option for him to go kind of make a trip out of that.
2788740	2790020	So they're off to PAX.
2790420	2791660	Whereas the rest of us are Dragon Con.
2792500	2794020	All right, let's move on.
2794060	2795100	Time for gaming news.
2795100	2797540	And there was quite a bit of it this week with Gamescom and all that, right, Loki?
2797580	2799340	Yes, lots of big announcements.
2799700	2803660	Sony came through with what they said they were planning on doing, which was announcing
2803660	2804620	their release plans.
2804620	2811340	And so with that came the release date of November 15th for the PlayStation 4.
2811980	2816860	That is, of course, in North America, November 29th in Europe.
2817260	2824980	And yeah, so it's kind of nice to actually have an actual lockdown date.
2825420	2829140	They did announce that they're going to be launching, I should say, they poked fun at
2829140	2835500	other console manufacturers and saying that they're going to be launching in 32
2835500	2838060	territories this year.
2838060	2844540	So launch in Australia, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany,
2844540	2852260	Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Russia,
2852260	2860820	Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK, and I guess Latin America, also Argentina, Brazil,
2860820	2867580	Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Mexico, Panama and Peru.
2868900	2872180	And the US or North America as well, obviously.
2873140	2874860	And Japan, I just can't forget.
2875060	2876620	Although no date for Japan yet, right?
2877700	2881740	WhatupG in chat says, Sony has a press event in September, probably to announce the
2881740	2883060	Japanese PlayStation 4.
2883060	2884380	Yeah, that's Tokyo Game Show.
2884620	2887620	Would that mean maybe later that they get it later?
2887620	2891100	I'm thinking that they're probably going to be, it's going to be around the same time.
2891100	2892100	It could be later.
2892100	2893700	But I think that's not usual.
2893700	2895260	PlayStation 3, they got it earlier.
2895260	2896980	And I want to say PlayStation 2, they did too.
2896980	2901820	They could launch, you know, between that time or like, you know, it's going to be
2901860	2904860	around the same time, I think, probably in November still.
2905980	2912860	All righty. But I did not get to watch the Sony press conference.
2912860	2915100	I don't know if you watched it, but what did you think of it?
2915500	2916380	I thought it was good.
2916380	2919500	It was very reminiscent of E3.
2920460	2925180	It was weird in the beginning because they basically had someone on stage playing the
2925500	2927660	PlayStation 4 and showing kind of the interface and stuff.
2927860	2930900	Also kind of showing that, hey, we're pretty much done with this thing.
2930940	2932940	Like, you know, it's ready to go.
2933060	2934620	That's good, though. Yes, that's good.
2934620	2940860	So, you know, definitely we're going to get into a lot more of it, but, you know, still
2940860	2942460	focused on like indie stuff.
2942460	2947580	They announced some new IPs, you know, talked more about release dates for different
2947580	2952740	things like, you know, Gran Turismo and stuff and then showed off a lot of the things
2952740	2957820	that like just kind of pulled a few punches still against Microsoft.
2957820	2962060	And oh, yeah, there was a big sick burn at the end, wasn't there?
2962380	2966220	There's a couple. Yeah, something about the whole like and while others have changed
2966220	2967780	their message. I'm going from memory here.
2967780	2968740	This is the exact quote.
2968740	2973140	But while where others have changed their messages, we have stayed consistent with our
2973140	2976220	like there was definitely a little shade thrown.
2976220	2979780	Somebody brought the umbrella to the Sony press conference to make some shade.
2979780	2981020	Yes, it was.
2981020	2982260	It was interesting. Yeah.
2983180	2987140	So, well, this is a fun time of year because you know who's the winner in this scenario
2987180	2989540	when these two companies are fighting us, the gamers.
2990980	2993700	Hopefully, Loki, you look a little skeptical at that comment.
2995460	2997260	Yeah, we're the winners, I think.
2997420	2998940	All right. All right.
2998940	3001740	Well, let's get into some of the specifics that Loki mentioned a minute ago.
3002020	3006300	Here's one about and I believe they've announced something similar to this on the
3006300	3007340	Microsoft platform.
3007340	3011620	So this is, you know, just kind of meeting the challenge.
3011860	3013420	This is through PlayStation Network.
3013420	3017020	And I think a lot of it, though, they're talking more like retailer stuff like Amazon
3017100	3018500	GameStop doing something similar.
3018500	3019900	Gotcha. Well, here's what we're talking about.
3019900	3021780	The discount upgrade program.
3021780	3023460	That's that's what we're talking about here.
3024020	3029820	Apparently, there will be a program where if you buy these games on the PlayStation 3
3029820	3033060	and these are select games, not necessarily everything, but select games, you will have
3033060	3037660	the ability to upgrade to the PlayStation 4 version for a here's my quotey fingers,
3037780	3039900	significantly discounted price.
3040700	3045060	Does that mean 10 bucks off, 20 bucks off, 40 bucks off?
3045580	3050340	I don't know, but I would think it's a little more in the 15, 20 range than than what
3050340	3051500	some people might be thinking.
3051500	3056340	But who knows? Anyhow, limited time offer and some of the games involved will be Call
3056340	3060700	of Duty Ghosts, Assassin's Creed 4, Black Flag, Watch Dogs, Battlefield 4.
3060700	3065380	So you'll notice there's Ubisoft and EA in there, Activision and Warner Brothers, also
3065380	3069740	publishers that are partnering with Sony on this initiative, the upgrade initiative.
3069740	3074380	Do not know yet if it's a worldwide initiative, but certainly for North America at
3074380	3077900	least. And if Japan's getting something similar, I'm sure that will be detailed at
3077900	3078820	Tokyo Game Show.
3079260	3086260	Now, some other details here, even though I just said expect 20 dollar discounts, Call
3086260	3091300	of Duty Ghosts has said 10 bucks, not 10 bucks off, 10 bucks.
3092500	3094300	That's not bad. That's not bad at all.
3094300	3098220	So you buy the PlayStation 3 version of Call of Duty Ghosts, you can get the PlayStation
3098220	3100100	4 version for 10 dollars.
3100100	3101220	That's a damn good deal.
3101220	3104460	If they're all this good, may the skeptic in me be wrong.
3104540	3106740	If they're all this good, that's that's great.
3107620	3111620	But here's they say it's for a limited time.
3112420	3117620	And I would think who this is going to most apply to are the people that are just like not
3117620	3119220	this year for the PlayStation 4.
3119380	3124300	They're going to get their PlayStation 4s in 2014, you know, when some more software
3124300	3127420	comes out, when next year's holiday lineup starts coming out.
3127820	3130060	That's when people want to upgrade their games.
3130060	3132180	But this program is not going to be available by then, right?
3132340	3134740	I don't know. I didn't really see a time frame.
3134740	3138740	And I think it's more of like, let's play it and play it by ear and see what happens.
3138740	3144940	And, you know, it's all going to be because why would you purchase, you know, Call of Duty
3144940	3149860	Ghosts and then two weeks later, you're going to get your PlayStation 4 or whatever.
3149900	3153580	And oh, and I got to buy the PlayStation 4 version as well.
3153580	3156540	It's like you would think that you would just kind of wait it out a little bit.
3156580	3159060	Yeah. But I mean, I understand, you know.
3159100	3164420	Well, I could also see like folks that are going to have PlayStation 4s under their
3164420	3168420	Christmas trees or their menorahs or whatever you celebrate in the winter season.
3168420	3173500	Right. That you might end up with a PlayStation 4 there when you've bought all these
3173500	3175020	PlayStation 3 games.
3175340	3178580	But I'm kind of like, if you're going to buy a bunch of PlayStation 3 games.
3180700	3184100	Why aren't you just getting a PlayStation 4 if you're getting all these games?
3184100	3189020	I don't know. I mean, then again, you know, it's not like you just throw away $400
3189020	3192940	on the system, but the well, the advantage would be is that you can get a head start
3192940	3197260	on getting your stats up there for, you know, Call of Duty and, you know, Battlefield
3197260	3201900	and that kind of stuff. And so you start off and then you can do your transfer of your
3201900	3205020	stats over to PlayStation 4 and you kind of go from there.
3205500	3209340	All right. Now, Sony wanted to be clear that these upgrade prices, such as the one that
3209340	3213180	we just mentioned for Call of Duty Ghosts, they are going to be set by the publisher.
3213180	3214940	It's not something Sony is going to regulate.
3214940	3219900	A little bit of a clarification here from UK Managing Director Fergal Gara in an interview
3219900	3224940	with Digital Spy, quote, What will happen is the PlayStation 4 digital file will be made
3224940	3229740	available on the PlayStation Store, as it would be anyway, at launch, and the PS3 discs
3229740	3230980	will be sold through retail.
3231180	3235860	What the consumer can then do for a premium to be defined by the publisher is access the
3235860	3240140	PlayStation 4 digital game and then provided they still have the PlayStation 3 disc, they
3240140	3244020	will be able to play the PlayStation 4 version when they decide to buy the next gen.
3244180	3249140	That's a pretty clever solution because that doesn't allow you to, like, gamefly your PS3
3249140	3254660	game and then upgrade. If your PS3 disc is in the drive, you can use the PlayStation 4
3254660	3258580	digital version. That's a clever little way to do it.
3259300	3259800	Yeah.
3260980	3266900	That's all. I don't got anything to say. It's a clever little workaround. So, I mean, it's
3266900	3271940	not that much different than, let's say, the Xbox 360. You install a game to your hard
3272020	3275460	drive on the 360, you still require the disc in the drive, right?
3275460	3275940	Yeah.
3275940	3280740	Now it's just, we're seeing that bridging between two systems, which is kind of neat,
3280740	3284260	especially in light of the fact that the PlayStation 4 is not backwards compatible,
3284260	3285700	which is frustrating to some people.
3285700	3289700	I'm wondering if that would work different than, well, obviously, it would work different
3289700	3293780	if you bought a digital version of the game, I guess. You would just, you know, you wouldn't
3293780	3294420	have to do that.
3296180	3298340	All right. Well, let's move on with some more news.
3298340	3304500	DarkSakura, who's playing in Animal Crossing, but I don't blame her. You got OLR listeners
3304500	3305700	in Normandy right now?
3305700	3306100	Yeah.
3306100	3306420	Yeah.
3306420	3308820	We have Act Deft and Fifth Dream.
3308820	3310580	Okay. No Misty hitting you with a bug net?
3310580	3311140	I know.
3311140	3314580	That's good. Have a look out for her.
3314580	3319140	There is a little bit more information for items going to be available for the PlayStation
3319140	3326100	4, and one of them is going to be Twitch. It was at GamersCon. They basically said that
3326100	3332500	players will be able to broadcast over Twitch channels. So there goes the need for a capture
3332500	3335700	card. You'll just be doing it online, which is pretty cool.
3337300	3341700	What's also interesting to me about this is that, um, you know, they, they talked about
3341700	3346260	the game streaming thing before, but it was going to be Ustream originally, which is not
3346260	3351140	my favorite broadcast service, especially for video games, because they kind of insert
3351140	3355220	their ads a lot and it can, you know, as the broadcaster, that can be frustrating because
3355220	3361460	people lose key moments of your broadcast. Um, but Twitch is a very popular streaming
3361460	3367140	solution for people. And, uh, in fact, there isn't a lot of competition out there to Twitch,
3367140	3370740	which really surprises me, meaning like focused on video game. I know there's others. I've
3370740	3376900	heard of one called Owned, but nothing on that same stale scale of Twitch. So I'm seeing
3376900	3380500	this type of stuff kind of break through on the mainstream media too. Like I was seeing
3380500	3384100	something on either CNN or Yahoo or one of those sites where they were talking about,
3384100	3388900	you know, more people watch Twitch TV than some basic cable channels.
3389940	3396580	True. So it's, it's very much a new, new medium or new media. And now everybody's going to get
3396580	3402660	to do their own broadcast right from their PlayStation four or their Xbox one, to be fair,
3402660	3408020	which is detailed a similar plan. It's cool. Yeah. I think it's cool too. The only problem
3408020	3413540	is that although, although I think it's, you know, I'm a big support for everybody getting
3413540	3418020	to have a voice and independent broadcast and all that, and I've supported, I almost worry that
3418020	3422740	the, with so much out there, it's going to be really difficult to stand out.
3422740	3426900	Yeah. I kind of wish that there was a way, I mean, I'm not, I'm not too familiar with all the
3426900	3431860	export options that they have available. Like if you can export those files, like you can,
3432740	3436740	cause I know they have the sharing stuff that you can do, or you can share clips online,
3436740	3441300	but I wonder if you can like export a huge file or something to like YouTube or export it to
3441300	3446340	your computer and edit it. If it's saving to the Twitch website, you can export Twitch videos to
3446340	3451220	YouTube. I have a let's play the slender man, where I screamed very high pitch when I saw
3451220	3455540	slender man that's on my YouTube, which is a Rob Roberts plays, I think in my YouTube channel.
3455540	3459060	And that was an export from Twitch. I think this whole thing bodes well for Twitch itself,
3459060	3463860	just given that they're also going to have the Xbox deal too. Oh yeah. This is huge for them.
3463860	3468020	And remember Twitch started as well, and they still run it just in TV, that whole,
3468100	3472900	which was streaming your life. And I think in some ways, just I'm, I'm going to be,
3472900	3476580	I'm just going to give you guys real talk from my perspective. I think Justin TV kind of became
3476580	3481300	a joke in some ways, because it kind of became a lot of cam whores and people that were like,
3481300	3488100	you know, pay me $5 and I'll show you my titty or show you my junk or whatever. It's kind of what,
3488100	3491620	even though you're not supposed to have adult content, that's a lot of that life casting
3491620	3498260	turned into, but it's really great that those guys kind of thought ahead and, you know, kind of
3498900	3501780	grabbed on this gaming thing that was going on. That was a little more,
3502500	3510500	you know, a little more serious, I guess. So, all right. Anyhow, I plan to use this. It'll be,
3510500	3515300	it'll be fun. Yeah, I'll definitely check it out, especially, um, since I finally got around to
3515300	3519940	playing around with my video capture equipment, the new stuff, um, some of the stuff I might be
3519940	3527460	capturing with the brand new Twitch feature on PlayStation 4. Minecraft is a big surprise. This
3527460	3535540	was something that was kind of, it was very quick, uh, reveal. They didn't really show anything other
3535540	3540900	than a logo and some people walking by in costume and not even really costume, but with a mask on,
3540900	3546260	but yes, Minecraft will be coming to the PlayStation 4 at launch. And it's also coming
3546260	3554100	to PlayStation 3 and the Vita. And, um, there, I gotta say, internet, seriously,
3556020	3562500	people on Twitter don't harass the Xbox support people regarding, like, announcements and shit.
3562500	3568100	Xbox support is for helping people with shit that's wrong on your Xbox, not saying,
3568100	3573780	hey, I see Minecraft, you know, which was, you know, originally a console exclusive for
3573780	3578180	Xbox 360, it's coming to PlayStation 4, how do you like them apples, you know, type of shit.
3579140	3585940	Technically, if you want to get, you know, into it there, yes, Microsoft has an exclusive on
3585940	3592820	Minecraft, the Xbox 360 edition and Minecraft, the Xbox One edition. Minecraft and PlayStation 4
3592820	3598260	will be created by yet a different company other than 4J Studios. And so, yes, it will be
3598260	3605140	technically exclusive to PlayStation 4, whereas a different version of Minecraft is exclusive to
3605700	3610180	the Xbox platforms. There, you're done. Stop emailing those people or stop, you know,
3610900	3615780	tweeting to them. And yes, they're saying that, you know, it's created by Microsoft Studios,
3615780	3620660	so therefore it is exclusive to Xbox. Yes, their version of the game is exclusive to the Xbox.
3620660	3624580	Yeah, Bobby Blackwolf in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com, kind of echoing the same
3624580	3629940	sentiment there. Xbox or excuse me, Microsoft Xbox 360 edition is still an Xbox 360 exclusive.
3629940	3635940	Yes, exactly. So I would be interested to see what differences there are in it. So,
3636580	3642820	yeah, be very interesting to see that. So, yeah, so there's that. And then, of course, other
3643620	3651620	wonderful console exclusives. And this is basically talking a little bit about the indie
3651620	3658260	games, because they were a big focus on the presentation. And some of their exclusives
3658260	3666420	they're saying are going to be Hotline Miami 2, N++, Starbound, let's see, Volume,
3667380	3675220	which is done by the guy who did Thomas Was Alone, Rogue Legacy, Wasteland Kings. And everybody's
3675220	3681300	gone through the rapture, which I love the the parody account. Was it? Was it the Kazari
3681300	3684340	parody account who said, yeah, it's a sequel to everybody's golf, you know,
3686100	3692260	well, dark. Yeah. So there's that. And then, of course, other things, the binding of Isaac Rebirth
3692260	3700660	of Velocity two X and Guns of Icarus online. And I guess Velocity, I think it was Velocity,
3700660	3704180	you know, it wasn't velocity. There's there's another game they announced free that was going
3704180	3709860	to be available for PlayStation 4 with PlayStation Plus. So you're going to get quite a lineup of
3709860	3717860	free games, especially indie titles at launch. It'll be interesting. All right. Well, this is
3717860	3722580	a little awkward, but these things happen, especially in live radio. I think we're going
3722580	3730420	to say goodbye to Jamie for now, right? Yeah. Basically, the allergy thing is getting to the
3730420	3733700	point where I'm now lightheaded. OK, but you are safe to drive because I don't want you leaving
3733700	3737860	here if you can't drive. Yeah, if I if you can go lie down in the other room if you need to
3737860	3746180	during the show, if if I do it now, I'll be OK. But I know how you ever have allergies to put
3746180	3751780	where your face hurts. I'm going to be honest. I don't really get allergies. I mean, certain
3751780	3756820	things. OK, funny story, if you really want to hear it. OK, I'm really allergic to marijuana.
3757380	3763540	Like so. And you know what? I'm I'm I'm liberal enough where I'm like, if you want to smoke it
3763540	3767140	in the privacy of your own home and I know people do it, you know, I don't want to get too political
3767140	3772660	or whatever, but I really don't care. But I don't want people doing it around me because I get
3772660	3778580	really sick and I get these really bad reactions to it. So it's it's kind of I get around the
3778580	3784500	smoke. Yes, me too. You remember that time at Tia's house? Oh, yes. That was horrible. I was
3784500	3787860	when they lit up in the front. You seem to be. I love that we just gave away a secret.
3791860	3796260	It's all right. No, it's fine. We've been out drinking all night. Yeah. I crashed out on her
3796260	3805540	bed and then I came out, of course, fully sober. Excuse me. And then I smell where it had been.
3806340	3811780	Yeah. And then I went and threw up everything. Oh, yeah. Anyway, we can reminisce another time.
3811780	3815460	Take care of yourself for heaven's sake. Thank you. All right. Sorry, kids.
3815460	3821780	Thank you for the well wishes. Any last minute thoughts for I think I think I
3821780	3826180	realized what made myself worse was that I brought the one thing I thought would be quick and easy to
3826180	3831700	cook. And that was Pollock Paneer. The Trader Joe's ones uses chilies and I have a super bad
3831700	3837380	chili allergy. So that's probably my own fault. Allergy plus allergy equals super allergy.
3837380	3843060	Yeah. All right. And so I've got tea at home and I've got lots of Benadryl and Sudafed and Nyquil.
3843620	3847780	So I might pass out or either that or you'll see me in chat. All right. Well, we hope to hear from
3847780	3853140	you later. Feel better for heaven's sake. And such is the risk of doing live radio. Loki and I will
3853140	3857220	hold down the fort here for the rest of the night. Thank you guys. All right. Drive safe. If you need
3857220	3864820	me, call my phone and I will make sure my ringer is on. And if you need me, call me or something.
3864820	3869540	You can have your 3DS charger back now. That's fine. Thank you. Okay.
3870980	3876740	Back to it. Alan Alchemy in chat says, mark down that timestamp. That's an edit. No, it's live and
3876740	3884980	it's funny. SSG100 Matt says, everyone's allergies change after several years. So. All right. Tiger
3884980	3891220	Claw in chat says, Skye, isn't everyone allergic to marijuana? It smells so bad. Trust me. I know
3891220	3896580	some people that if they're allergic to marijuana, then they are gluttons for punishment because
3897380	3902820	plenty of it. Well, did I tell you about how I found out I had an allergy to it? Huh?
3902820	3909140	It was a girl's bathroom at school. And I, all the other bathrooms were like being cleaned. So I went
3909140	3911940	to the front bathroom that was by the office, which ironically is the one that everyone
3911940	3919380	spoke to. And I got in there and I was so sick in the stall that I had to turn around and throw up.
3919380	3925060	And then I had a rash on my face. It was awful. No fun at all. All right. Uh, you're gonna be
3925060	3930980	okay. You sure? All right. Drive safe. Love you guys. Bye. All right. Where were we?
3931940	3937060	Little big planet. That was another big announcement. How do you, how do you follow
3937060	3945540	up marijuana stories by talking about little big planet? It's sack boy. He's jumping in its colors.
3945540	3953700	Oh, there are all the music, man. No, no, no. Hold on. I bet you that there's quite a few
3953700	3959460	marijuana inspired levels in living planet. I guarantee that there's like, Hey, I'm going to
3959460	3968260	totally put pot leaves in this level. You got to get stowed. If there's a level dedicated to, um,
3969460	3973460	what was her name? That actress Parker Posey. That was my favorite little big planet. I ever
3973460	3979140	level I ever played was the Parker Posey level, which was like creepy stalker almost,
3979140	3987700	but I loved it anyway. Ah, so little big planet hub is a free to play service coming to the
3987700	3992340	PlayStation three. That's going to have many elements of the little big planet universe.
3992340	3997220	A little big planet hub will allow players to collaborate with online teammates for challenges,
3997220	4002020	level creation, wardrobe coordination via a redesigned shop interface.
4002020	4006740	A little big planet hub is said to offer unrestricted access in quotes to the little
4006740	4012180	big planets create mode 16 levels taken from previous little big planet games on the PlayStation
4012180	4017700	three. And then the hub exclusive team picks will highlight a new batch of community created levels
4017700	4022180	every week. And the new weekly challenges mode boasts a whole new way to play little big planet.
4022180	4025460	Curious if that's going to have access to like all the levels that are created out there. Cause
4025460	4028820	if that's the case and you probably don't need a single player version of the game. Well, and also
4028820	4032580	it does sound like though they might nickel and dime some of the content like, cause you know,
4032580	4038180	in the create mode in the games, you have to unlock that by playing the single player mode.
4039300	4043700	So it's like, if you want to, you know, you can create these levels, but if you want to use the
4043700	4048660	grappling hook gun, you're going to have to buy that if you want to use, you know, I think that's
4048660	4052180	how they're going to do it. You'll be able to make very basic levels, but you won't be able to make
4052180	4058820	the really good stuff without buying something. But I understand now it's free. Yep. Free to play
4058820	4063700	allows you to get your foot in the door, but if I'm not mistaken, little big planet two is still
4063700	4070740	a PlayStation plus title, right? No, no. I thought it was cardiness. Ah, gotcha. So yeah,
4070740	4076660	but a little bit plant two right now, it's gotta be dirt cheap. I mean, if it's been a long time
4076660	4082660	since it's been out, I mean, so right. Should be all right. All right. All right. So league of
4082660	4091700	legends. Yes. Um, they got hacked and apparently there was info that was access and, um, you know,
4091700	4097220	that includes, you know, usernames, email addresses, salted passwords and credit card
4097220	4101540	numbers as well. But once again, those were salted, uh, which means, you know, they're
4101540	4107860	encrypted and you know, they have some random stuff thrown in there as well to make it
4107860	4112420	difficult, difficult to unencrypted. So while that stuff was leaked out, you probably just want to
4112420	4115860	change your login password information because that's pretty much the only thing that they do
4115860	4122820	have access to. Um, and you obviously, uh, you know, if you use the same login and password
4122820	4127700	combination on other sites, it's going to be the first thing we try. So make sure you change that
4127700	4133540	stuff. I wouldn't worry too much about the, um, credit card information and the billing information
4133540	4141220	stuff because, you know, that stuff was encrypted and it looks like that it would be difficult for
4141220	4147300	them to crack all that. But still never good to hear that again. League of legends is a huge game
4147300	4152420	too. It's not good to hear that they got hacked. Now, luckily I used a unique password for league
4152420	4155860	of legends cause I just kind of thought something like this might happen, but now I'm going to need
4155860	4160100	a second unique password cause they're going to make everybody change it. I haven't logged in in
4160100	4164820	a week though. Yeah. They say that, you know, they're taking the appropriate action into
4164820	4168820	notify and safeguard effective players is that we'll be contacting these players via email
4168820	4173460	addresses currently associated with their accounts to alert them. Our investigation is ongoing and
4173460	4179940	we take all the necessary steps to protect players. So, all right. Well, you didn't have a
4179940	4183460	league of legends account so you don't have to worry about it, right? Don't play it. So not a
4183460	4187220	problem. Lucky you. Yep. Yep. Yep. Lucky you. All right. Let's travel around the world and check
4187220	4191700	out some release dates and what's coming out to a gaming store near you. Few things this week,
4191700	4197860	lost planet three on PlayStation three and Xbox 360. Little known fact about lost planet three.
4197860	4202180	I don't think Capcom thinks it's going to do very well. So they're not making any reprints of it.
4202820	4207540	Once the launch quantities are gone, it's gone. Apparently. Really? I don't believe that though.
4207540	4212580	If it were to do very well, which I kind of agree with Capcom in this regard, I don't think it will
4212580	4218580	do very well. Sorry. Uh, but if it does, I mean, they can always just reprint it. Not what they
4218580	4222580	did with like Katamari Damacy and some of these other minimally. And I think, I think that a lot
4222580	4226100	of that is just to get the buzz out there. So that's information gets out. So they're like,
4226100	4231220	Oh, I need to get it because I won't be able to get it otherwise. No, no, don't, don't bother.
4231220	4237860	Uh, Final Fantasy 14 out this weekend, PC and PlayStation three, uh, killer is dead on
4237860	4244020	PlayStation three and Xbox three 60. If you're a fan of Suda 51 and to be at Jamie left,
4244020	4251380	but a hot sunay Miku project diva F on PlayStation three this week. And, uh, was it last but not
4251380	4260980	least Madden NFL 25 coming out? Oh, and painkiller Helen damnation on PS3. All right. Let's travel
4260980	4265620	to Japan and then maybe you can pick up the UK dates here that we would usually do. Cause I'm
4265620	4269460	trying to replace the classic game of the week here. So I don't want to take Jamie's game.
4269460	4276740	I'm working frantically on that. Um, all while we're doing live radio. So trying to go to the
4276740	4284260	Japanese release dates and here they are on the PlayStation three this week on August the 27th,
4284260	4290740	Final Fantasy 14 makes its way to Japan as well. The name there, Final Fantasy 14 online,
4290740	4298100	Shinsei yours. And yours is the name of the realm that we all play in. Um, like Azeroth is in, in
4298100	4302740	world of Warcraft. So, uh, I'm assuming that is their own interpretation of what we have as the
4302740	4309300	subtitle realm reborn as out in Japan on the 27th as well on the 29th, which I believe is Thursday,
4309300	4313940	or which is a more typical release day there you get end of eternity, getting a price reduction
4313940	4319620	on PlayStation three, Joe Joe's bizarre adventure, all star battle and lost planet three gets
4319620	4324420	Japanese release as well. So if all the U S copies disappear, you could always import one.
4325140	4330740	Uh, assuming you have a region free PlayStation three, uh, Xbox three 60 has must Monster Hunter
4330740	4337860	frontier G anniversary, 2013 premium package coming out on the 28th of August and lost planet
4337860	4343060	three on the Xbox three 60 as well. I have no idea what's in that repackaging a Monster Hunter, but
4343060	4349060	it's pretty popular over there on the PlayStation Vita. Hotchkiss comes out on August 29th as does
4349060	4353700	Ragnarok Odyssey ACE. I don't know if that's the same Ragnarok adventures game we got.
4354660	4359780	Yeah. There's been another Ragnarok, um, Odyssey games ACE I think was one that was on
4360500	4366740	DS or three DS. It was, it's, I think that's a new, a re-release or something or not re-release,
4366740	4374260	but a port. Um, sadly, no, uh, Wii U games this week. Uh, I saw some Disney infinity on my list,
4374260	4377860	but I think that's just a, I think some people over there are importing ours.
4379460	4382820	I don't think it's out in Japan yet, and I'm not sure there's plans to do that there with
4382820	4386900	all the toys and everything. I just, it's probably not as practical, but I bet there's some people
4386900	4391380	over there importing our version of it. Probably. You never really hear about the imports the other
4391380	4394100	way around, but I would think that's one of those games that there's people in Japan that
4394100	4398820	are importing it for the figures. Disney's very popular in Japan. I can imagine. Yeah.
4398820	4405140	Nintendo three DS gets Sherlock Holmes puzzle city and starry sky in autumn three D in regular
4405140	4409860	and limited edition. And I was going to see real quick if there's anything on the PSP,
4409860	4412820	because believe it or not, they still get releases there once in a while. And, uh,
4412820	4418180	Solomon's ring elemental pack comes out on the Sony PS. I completely forgot actually on the PSP
4418180	4425380	this week, sweet fuse at your side, I think is the name. And that's a PSP title coming out over here.
4425940	4431940	Visual novel access go figure, but not those visual novel tiles, man. All right. Just a couple
4431940	4436580	more stories for you guys. And then the classic game of the week. Um, let's see in the UK, we're
4436580	4442020	getting, um, counseling Lords of shadows, and this is on PC. I'm assuming that's coming to steam
4442020	4448420	final fantasy 14 realm reborn on PlayStation three and PC, uh, also on Mac Bioshock infinite. I
4448420	4453140	believe it's also coming out here as well on steam, uh, guardians of middle earth, also a PC
4453140	4459860	release. Um, they're getting, uh, etrian odyssey for legends of the Titan on three DS, uh, killer
4459860	4465620	is dead on PlayStation three and Xbox three 60 also lost planet three on Xbox three 60
4465620	4471060	PlayStation three and PC. Of course, PC being the steam, uh, Rayman legends actually coming
4471060	4476180	out a little bit early over there on Wii U and PC, Xbox three 60 and PlayStation three.
4476900	4482660	And then, uh, some stuff that doesn't have a date on it, but it's just marked August,
4482660	4487540	the walking dead 400 days and payday too. I'm not sure that stuff's already been out yet, but
4487540	4496580	it is over here. So that's it. All right. Um, so let's talk a little bit about some other stuff
4496580	4499620	that they discussed during the PlayStation conference. And actually a lot of this was
4500180	4508660	leaked out beforehand, but the Vita got a price drop one 99 in the U S and 199 Euro in Europe.
4510020	4516820	Also, it should be mentioned that the PlayStation three 12 gigabyte system came out here over, uh,
4516820	4521300	as well because it is in Europe and that's also one 99. So PlayStation three and
4522260	4526980	Vita for one idea and I'm, and they actually do have a bundle too. Uh, and the one 99 price
4526980	4531620	points for like the three G one. And they also have like the walking dead. They have a bundle
4531620	4536020	that's also one 99 as well. So do you think this is enough to kind of get a fire lit under the
4536020	4540260	Vita's butt or is this too little too late? It will help, but they have some pretty good games
4540260	4543540	coming out. And especially a lot of these indie games that are going to be cross platform with,
4543540	4548340	you know, PlayStation Vita as well. They have a lot of content coming in. It's going to be
4548340	4553300	advertising that content to, uh, the consumer, I think is going to be the toughest part,
4553300	4557380	especially since they don't really have any huge games coming out outside from like tear away
4557940	4563540	and, um, kill zone, kill zone will be good. That's supposed to be actually a really good
4563540	4568340	first person shooter. Um, I heard rumors that they may do a Vita version of ghosts,
4568900	4573940	but it would have to be somebody other than, uh, I can't remember the developer, but the guy,
4573940	4580020	the guys that did fucking resistance and call of duty last year that just sucked. They were
4580020	4584820	terrible. Um, so as long as they get somebody else to develop that it would be pretty good.
4584820	4589060	Borderlands two is going to help too. So I re will it because I'm going to be honest,
4589060	4592420	when I heard the news about Borderlands two on the Vita, I was kind of like, no, don't get me
4592420	4596340	wrong. Borderlands two awesome game. I know people are really into it and rightfully so,
4596340	4600660	but I'm kind of like, hasn't everybody who's going to get Borderlands two already got it.
4600660	4608100	All right. All right. All right. Minecraft. True. True. That could be said for a lot of games,
4608100	4612500	I guess, but Minecraft on the go, man. And I understand. Yeah, they have the pocket edition,
4612500	4621140	but if this version is a little bit more like the PC version, oh, that it's all sorts of greatness.
4621140	4626820	Um, okay. Maybe it could talk to the PC version or the PS3 version would be very awesome.
4626820	4630500	It would be awesome if it was, you know, I don't think you could do the PS4, but if all
4630500	4634740	three versions talk to each other, they'd be fantastic. Um, Sony's not as much of a hard
4634740	4641060	ass on the play, uh, the PC communicating with Sony servers. I mean, we see DC universe online
4641060	4645220	is on both, even though I don't think their servers are cross-play, but final fantasy 14
4645220	4649300	just came out and it's cross-played between the two. Um, what there's something else I'm
4649300	4653300	thinking of this PC and, and, uh, PlayStation cross. Oh, well like this, the whole steam
4653300	4657060	integration and a portal. I think the problem though with doing that is a lot of it, they have
4657060	4661460	to develop the engine to be similar because they want the same draw distance and same features in
4661460	4666500	there. And if, if one is significantly less power than the other one, they can't really do that.
4667140	4672660	Um, but I don't know. Anyway, so yeah, Borderlands two, that's supposed to come in 2014 sometime.
4672660	4677220	I'm thinking maybe holiday cause it, you know, no date yet. Really good comment from Monty Boggs
4677220	4681940	in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com. If I can transfer PlayStation three data,
4681940	4686660	Borderlands two Vito would be tempting. Transfarring, wasn't that the whole term
4686660	4692340	that Konami came up with a while ago? Transfarring your data. That is, I I'll give you that. That is
4692340	4698820	a pretty, pretty good reason to not do it. Um, the whole thing would depend on if the game is
4698820	4703940	going to have all the same guns in it. If they, they develop all the same assets that are in the,
4704500	4709620	uh, PlayStation three version, then yes, they could do that because you can swap between,
4709620	4714820	you can basically dump your save from PlayStation three, convert it to an Xbox three 60 or,
4714820	4719700	you know, PC format and stuff. You can do that already. Um, with some mod tools, but
4719700	4726500	if you can, if they have all, shouldn't it all be in the cloud? Well, it all depends though.
4726500	4731460	Cause like if, if they have all that information, maybe they could do it without the guns. I don't
4731460	4735860	know. It would be, it's possible. Depends on the content that's in the game. I think that they
4735860	4741540	could bring in all the guns, but we'll see. Um, also the Vita memory cards, one of the things
4741540	4746580	that people were complaining about a lot because they are pretty expensive, um, are being reduced
4746580	4753060	in price as well. Um, so apparently they are, I don't remember the final amounts to those.
4753620	4759140	Let's see. So the Vita memory cards previously, for example, four gigabyte memory card is now
4759140	4765780	$14.99 whereas originally $20. Uh, the eight gigabyte memory card is now $19.99 where it was
4765780	4775540	30, 16 is a $39.99 where it was 60 and the 32 gigabyte, um, card is $80 where it was a hundred.
4775540	4780180	So they are knocking the price off of those. Um, it still sucks that it's proprietary, but
4781620	4786580	what are you going to do? I mean, might as well invest in a pretty big memory card because,
4786580	4791380	you know, especially if you do PlayStation Plus, get a bunch of freebies. I think that's also
4791380	4796340	another strong point. If they market that well enough, it's like, hey, you buy, you know,
4796340	4801060	PlayStation Vita, you get PlayStation Plus, you can download a ton of fucking games. So why not?
4801060	4804580	It would be very, if they can really bring, if the Vita has a Renaissance or whatever you want
4804580	4808100	to call it, where it really does kind of seem to take off this holiday season and essentially
4808100	4813060	resurrect from the dead. Uh, you can't tell me that the Wii U can't do the same thing.
4813060	4819300	They need a price drop because the Wii U is still $349. That's not going to cut it.
4819300	4823940	We have something later on that might sweeten the pot a little bit, but I kind of agree that
4823940	4828260	there's going to be, need to be a hard drop, uh, or Nintendo is going to be in trouble, but
4829140	4831380	not that there's not a lot of great games coming, but.
4834740	4839700	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com,
4839700	4846820	use the passphrase, judge. All right. Anyhow, um, let's move on to one more story here about
4846820	4850260	Killer Instinct and some new information that came out about the game this week.
4850260	4854420	One of those details, uh, in the free to play version of Killer Instinct, you will be able to
4854420	4861060	buy the additional characters for $5 each. Killer Instinct will be free to play with one character
4861060	4867460	when the console comes out. There will be a 1999 combo breaker pack that unlocks the game's full
4867460	4875140	roster of eight characters, including two of them that are exclusive fighters that are not initially
4875140	4881060	available for individual purchase. Meaning if you do piecemeal your game, you will have six
4881060	4888260	fighters to choose from. There will also be a $40 ultra edition that will bundle all playable
4888260	4895700	characters, also an accessory and costume pack thingy and the original 1994 arcade version
4895700	4900500	of Killer Instinct, which has a lot of people more happy about the arcade version on their
4900500	4904420	Xbox One than I think some people are about the new Killer Instinct. If you think there's only eight
4904420	4909140	characters in this game, you're full of crap because they're gonna fucking put DLC out there.
4909140	4915140	They're gonna make you buy those fucking characters. Well, I think yes and no. I think it will be eight
4915140	4920740	this year. And then depending on how the game does, because this is how they're talking, they're saying
4920740	4926740	well you will have the 2013 season that has these eight characters and then next year we can put
4926740	4931860	along eight more characters and put that into the game. I'm literally hearing, and I'm trying to be
4931860	4936740	open and understanding, but what I'm literally hearing is we're making it up as we go along.
4937700	4944740	Eight characters in a fighting game seems kind of lame and the whole charging $5 for the characters
4944740	4950500	is basically to get you to buy the $20 pack. They never were intending for you to buy piecemeal
4950500	4953780	characters. They're just like, yeah, we'll put it there. They want to be able to say it's free
4953780	4958340	to play. Well, we'll put it there so that it, you know, people want to buy the $20 pack. That's all
4958340	4963300	it really comes down to. And $20 for a fighting game is not a bad thing. Eight characters does
4963300	4970020	seem quite low, but that's the original Street Fighter II had eight characters and even then
4970020	4976740	there were still four bosses on top of that. So that's just the only, you know, and it's not the
4976740	4982820	Street Fighter II was a bad game. It's just not 1991 anymore. You know, and I did get a tweet
4982820	4986980	earlier this week and I apologize. I forgot the username of who sent it, but the tweet said,
4986980	4991540	because I said I was shading the fact that there was only the, you know, eight characters and I
4991540	4997780	got a tweet that said, what about quality over quantity? And I was, I never responded to it
4997780	5000980	because I was mobile or something like that. But honestly, my answer to that is, wait a minute
5000980	5006020	though. Part of the reason that make fighting games so much fun is kind of the diversity of the
5006020	5010980	roster. And you look at the fighting games that come out today, eight characters doesn't cut it
5010980	5016660	anymore. You know, you gotta have at least 15, 20, how many did the new Mortal Kombat have? Like,
5016660	5022980	you know, you have a good, a good diverse roster makes the game more fun. Eight characters sounds
5022980	5027700	like we rushed this game to get it out for the launch. Like a lot of the other games that have
5027700	5033460	been coming out launched for the platform seems like a lot of it's rushed and maybe, you know,
5033460	5037860	bring out more characters later on so they can sell it as DLC. I think originally this game is
5037860	5042420	probably going to be a retail release, but they just can't get it done in time. That's what really
5042420	5046980	concerns me is that all these signs are pointing, you know, it's like these warning signs are popping
5046980	5051700	up about this game. And I, it has me really concerned. Well, I don't think it's just this
5051700	5057700	game. It's like Forza 5, for example, where it's shipping unfinished, you know, come on.
5057940	5061460	That's just, I, so why? It's a day one patch. Okay. I understand that. But
5062420	5067940	dude, it's, you better hope that your servers are fucking working day one because there's going to
5067940	5072260	be some piss people. Well, I guess not because there's still content in the game, but you're
5072260	5077540	just not gonna be able to play the full thing yet. And here's the other thing. I kind of don't trust
5077540	5082660	Microsoft to keep it going and I'm going to use my big old standby that I always bring up on the
5082660	5085940	show and you're sick of hearing me talk about it. Well, there's two of them member. Oh, well,
5085940	5091220	the one I've got in my mind is remember when they said we're going to bring a thousand games to
5091220	5097300	game room. And then what happened about 200 came out across 13 packs and they pulled the plug.
5097300	5103380	So those thousand games never happened. So isn't it feasible that if Killer Instinct comes out and
5104020	5108260	heaven forbid, it's not very good and people just aren't into it because there's not enough
5108260	5113780	characters. Do you think that 2014 pack will ever happen? Nope. No, because Microsoft will pull the
5113780	5119380	plug on it because they have a history of pulling the plug on things. Uh, that, that could have been
5119380	5123620	even better if it just had a little more time. Oh, Oh, I thought of the other one, one versus a
5123620	5129700	hundred. Is that the other one? That would have been the other one or just those interactive game
5129700	5140660	shows in general. Grr. Anyhow, or an actual legitimate use for the Xbox. Weiland in our chat
5140660	5145780	room says I'm waiting for a PC Killer Instinct. Is that something they said is going to happen?
5145780	5151620	Cause I don't know if I would see that happen. Um, probably not just because they want every
5151620	5156580	way to purchase the Xbox one stuff. I think maybe later on down the line, one windows eight takes
5156580	5162180	off and a lot more people have windows eight and that windows marketplace is more of a, you know,
5162180	5167140	robust thing. Then maybe you'll see stuff like that popping up there, but I just don't see it
5167140	5170740	happening. I don't know. All right. There's some other killer instinct news. I do want to make
5170740	5174900	sure I cover cause it's not just that, but there's also, um, another fighter that's been revealed
5174900	5179620	that they're calling a spider woman. Uh, it was teased at the end of a video that was posted. It
5179620	5184820	sounds like prematurely by game trailers. Uh, this character has the ability to throw spider
5184820	5189460	webs to attack and ensnare opponents. And she has a pair of blades on the back of each hand
5189460	5194900	and a blades on her forearms and so forth. Does not look like a previous killer instinct fighter,
5194900	5199940	which is fine game should, you know, new fighting games and a franchise should have some new people.
5199940	5204340	But, um, I bet there, I bet there's going to be some people that are a little irritated,
5204340	5210740	like, all right, so there's going to be eight fighters and we're going to fill them all up
5210740	5215620	with slots of, of people that are, that are new and not like where, where's orchid,
5215620	5222820	where's spinal. Those are coming in the DLC pack. The most, the most popular character will be one
5222820	5226740	of the two. I bet you orchid will be in there, but she'll be one of those characters that you
5226740	5230980	can only get when you buy, you can't piecemeal her. She'll be in that $20 combo pack. You have
5230980	5235140	to get her that way. I bet you that's how it works. Um, this is pretty cool news though,
5235140	5240100	despite all this, you know, negative things we might be saying about Killer Instinct.
5240100	5246020	Uh, this is pretty neat. Uh, creative director Adam Isgreen and producer Torrin Redding talking
5246020	5251540	about Killer Instinct mentioned the original announcer, Chris Sutherland, will be selectable
5251540	5255300	in lieu of the new announcer for Killer Instinct. So if you want to have the, uh,
5255300	5260500	old Killer Instinct experience when it comes to the announcer, you can do that. Uh, I guess he
5260500	5266260	did rerecord some lines and, uh, even though it's been 18 years later, sounds exactly the same. So
5266260	5271220	it sounds like he's aged a little better than DuckTales did. Oh, I went there. Why didn't they
5271220	5275460	just have him do it in the beginning? I mean, just have him be the guy. It is a little weird,
5275460	5281060	isn't it? Because maybe, maybe what they didn't say, they said Chris Sutherland will be selectable
5281140	5289780	in a 4.99 DLC pack. 4.99? Try $40 deals. $40 pack. For an announcer? Yeah, no, I bet you
5289780	5295460	$40 because you get the original game. So you get the original announcer too. Uh, maybe, maybe. Uh,
5296100	5300260	but I wasn't, well, Dota 2 sells these announcer packs. It's part of the way they make money.
5300260	5306900	They're free to play. Who knows? Tigerclaw in our chat pointing out, uh, is that character I
5306900	5312420	mentioned earlier? They can't call her Spiderwoman anyway, obviously. I wasn't calling her that,
5312420	5317540	but that's, she looks like that type of character. Dota 2 announcer packs. I saw the one from GLaDOS
5317540	5322580	and like one of the lines in there is it's, it's Oda. The D is silent.
5328020	5332980	Wow. All right. Uh, are we ready to get to the classic game of the week? Back in the day,
5332980	5339220	you didn't have to pay $5 per character. You got all of it or you got nothing.
5339220	5342020	And that takes us to a segment we call the classic game of the week.
5344260	5349700	Where DarkSakura will dive into the gaming vault, but not this week because she dived into her bed
5349700	5353940	to rest tonight. So I will dive into the gaming vault in her place and pick a game that you all
5353940	5357700	should be playing this week. Sorry, I'm laughing because Rama in the chat room says, screw you,
5357700	5362020	Rob Roberts, DuckTales hater. Now wait a minute, wait a minute, put the brakes on for a minute.
5362980	5367620	I didn't hate DuckTales. Go back and listen to my review last week. I just said there was,
5368740	5373380	I had two major issues with it. One, the sound production values on the console release were not
5373380	5378260	very good. Uh, that's not saying the voice talent wasn't very good, although they're clearly showing
5378260	5383620	their age, but Jun Fure is what like 95? Bless her heart that she can still do the game and sound as
5383620	5388180	good as she does. Uh, which is why I wish the sound production would have lended their talents
5388180	5392740	better to that. And two, I did not like that the cut scenes constantly interrupted the action
5392740	5401460	all the time in what should be a very action-based game. That being said, let's go back in the classic
5401460	5406180	game of the week and find a game that you should all be playing this week. Now I will say this,
5406180	5411220	I switched out the game at the last minute because the game that Janie picked, I want her to be able
5411220	5417380	to talk about the game and it's not a game I ever played. So I switched it out and one of the games
5417380	5421780	I have on the back burner to talk about, I wanted to share with you guys one of these days, uh, was
5421780	5425540	a game available on the Commodore 64 because you know I'm going to use this opportunity to do a
5425540	5431940	Commodore 64 game. Uh, the game is called the Great Gianna Sisters is the game I picked tonight.
5435780	5440740	Now the Great Gianna Sisters, some of you have probably heard of this game because there's the
5440740	5445860	Gianna Sisters Twisted Dreams, which is an indie game, uh, that just came out on what, Steam
5445860	5450980	Greenline? I think it's available on Xbox Arcade, right? And PlayStation? Yeah. So yes, its roots are
5450980	5459220	in this very old Commodore game. It was released in 19- 1987. It was done by Time Warp Productions
5459220	5464500	and then published by Rainbow Arts. It was actually on the Amiga. A lot of people know it
5464500	5470500	from the Amiga as well. The versions were on the MSX2, Atari ST, and the Amstrad CPC.
5471140	5476020	The Commodore 64 version was programmed by Armin Gessert and the graphics were done by
5476020	5484100	Manfred Trenz and the soundtrack was composed by Chris Huelsbeck. Uh, funny note, he came back later
5484100	5488500	to do the soundtracks for these later games that came out. There was also a DS game, uh, much later.
5488500	5495220	Yeah, I played the DS game and it was alright. Now the license is currently held by Black Forest Games
5495220	5500180	who did the modern day sequel, Gianna Sisters Twisted Dreams. In the game you take the role of
5500180	5505780	Gianna, a girl who fell asleep and finds herself in a dream world populated by monsters. You go
5505780	5510420	through the world and you are looking for a diamond which will wake her from the sleep and
5510420	5516820	return her to waking life. Now, most people know this game. If you've heard of this game, you know
5516820	5521700	it because it was a very controversial game when it came out on the Commodore 64 because
5522820	5529540	it looked a lot like Super Mario Brothers down to the fact that they did the whole World 1-1 thing.
5529540	5534740	What do I mean by that? Well, whenever a level creator comes out for a game, what's the first
5534740	5543220	thing people usually make? A penis and then after that World 1-1 from Super Mario Brothers, right?
5543220	5550340	Yeah. So, unfortunately in the case of the great Gianna Sisters, World 1 is pretty much World 1-1
5550340	5554820	from Super Mario Brothers. So the first level is almost identical in layout to Super Mario
5554820	5560660	Brothers and the game itself shares some similarities too. You pick up a magical pinwheel,
5560660	5566180	it makes you bigger and you don't throw a fireball per se, but it's a bouncing ball
5566180	5572900	just like the Game Boy version of Super Mario Brothers. But anyway,
5573860	5579780	Nintendo pressured the makers of the great Gianna Sisters threatening legal action if they do not
5579780	5585060	take appropriate action. The game was voluntarily withdrawn from sale. No lawsuits or anything like
5585060	5591540	that, but it was voluntarily withdrawn. Therefore, it makes this game very rare. Now, what they
5591540	5596500	don't say about the controversy and you don't know this unless you've played the game, the later
5596500	5601140	levels don't really look like Mario Brothers levels. I would say maybe the second level has
5601140	5605540	a little bit in common too, but I think there's 20 some-odd levels in the game and especially when
5605540	5610980	you get into later levels and some of the boss fights, it isn't like Mario Brothers in that regard.
5610980	5615300	But unfortunately, a lot of the basic game mechanics, you know, with the whole power-ups
5615300	5621220	and getting coins and jumping on the coin blocks and so forth, that is all still pretty similar. So
5621220	5626660	it probably was in this company's best interest to take the game off the market. But this is what
5626660	5632180	makes this game such a cult classic and why people desire it is that, you know, it was in a sense a
5632180	5639380	Super Mario-like game on a 1983 Commodore 64 and the soundtrack, the soundtrack, the soundtrack.
5639380	5645140	People love the soundtrack and rightfully so. Great, great music available in the game.
5646100	5651700	So it's no wonder that they brought Chris Hulsbeck back to do the later games.
5652980	5660100	So very well received, very highly rated in a lot of old Commodore 64 productions. Zzap 64 giving
5660100	5667780	it 96%. There are various ports out there, but the ZX Spectrum port that was planned was pulled
5667780	5675780	back because of the legal pressures. In 1993, the MSX version came out. The game had been ported to
5675780	5683140	Windows, DOS, Linux, but all unofficially. Also a Nintendo DS version unofficially of the Commodore
5683140	5690740	64 port, not to be confused with the official sequel of Gianna Sisters. There was also a mobile
5690740	5699220	version of the game made for Android phones in 2005. There was a sequel planned for the game
5699220	5705380	called Gianna 2, Arthur and Martha in Future World and it was supposed to have a futuristic setting,
5705380	5712020	but because of all the legal troubles, Time Warp renamed the game Hard and Heavy and changed the
5712020	5716180	protagonist to Robots. So if you've ever played the game Hard and Heavy, which came out on the
5716180	5721060	Commodore 64 in 1989, that was inspired by Gianna Sisters. It was supposed to be the sequel.
5722260	5728820	So Gianna Sisters DS was an actual sequel that did come out in 2009 and then of course I think
5728820	5734100	a lot of you know through Steam and so forth in July 2012 and the Kickstarter,
5734100	5741940	Gianna Sisters Twisted Dreams became a reality. So there you go, the classic game of the week,
5741940	5747220	the Gianna Sisters, the great Gianna Sisters. Yeah, have you ever heard of this game in your
5747220	5752500	life, Loki? Yes, I have played it actually. Do you like it? I mean, it's all right. You have
5752500	5756100	to remember it was Commodore 64 games were a little more basic. They have it on the Ouya,
5756100	5762100	you can actually get like the DS version of the game ported over. So they have that available
5762100	5768340	and I have played that DS version of the game as well. It's all right. Tigerclaw in Chat says,
5768340	5773380	does that new Gianna Sisters game poke fun at Nintendo despite them? No, it's pretty badass
5773380	5777860	actually. Yeah, and actually, yeah, the game doesn't play. I mean, the good thing is they
5777860	5782260	turn this, it's still a platforming game, but it's way different now and it is badass. Like you flip
5782260	5787460	between the sisters and it causes changes in the environment and yeah, I've played through a bit
5787460	5791620	of it on Steam and it's a fun little game to play. I think I talked about it on a previous episode
5791620	5797700	of the show, but as far as like a straight up platformer goes, it's a lot of fun. Shadow Next
5797700	5802980	Gen says, has Rob played the modern port of Gianna Sisters? No, I haven't. I played the DS
5802980	5809540	one and I played this new one, Twisted Sisters. I did not even know until doing last minute research
5809540	5814900	for the article tonight that there was later ports that came on. So by the way, look at what
5814900	5820820	she's fighting here in this video. It's like a giant enemy crab. This game was just ahead of its
5820820	5828180	time. The Great Gianna Sisters, classic game of the week. How about that? Did I do good with,
5828180	5834180	with 15 minutes to pick a game? Anyhow, we're going to take a quick break. And when we come
5834180	5838180	back with more of Orange Lounge Radio, we got more news for you guys. The Fugu question of the week,
5838180	5841540	I know our beginnings of the show was a little Sony heavy. So we are going to talk about some
5841540	5846820	of the goings on in Microsoft's world. Uh, don't have a lot in Nintendo news this week. Uh, that
5846820	5850980	was more a couple of weeks ago, but with their Nintendo Directs and so forth, we do have at
5850980	5854340	least one big piece of Nintendo news coming up after the break. And then of course, most
5854340	5861060	importantly, your calls, your emails, your voices. When we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5867140	5873860	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio in progress with episode number 517 of our program,
5874420	5881140	August 25th, 2013. Um, and of course there is no show over Labor Day weekend. So this is the show
5881140	5884420	that's going to have to hold you over for two weeks. But the good news is I just said it's
5884420	5889780	episode 517. So if you're newer to the show, you have a whole archive of shows you can go listen
5889780	5893300	to if you don't mind hearing some old news, but there's always like a different classic game of
5893300	5898980	the week and you know, whatever controversies are going on. So, uh, uh, I believe we have episodes
5898980	5904580	dating back four years still on the same server. I mean, you can't, you can't easily get episode
5904580	5909220	one or things like that. I mean, it was a very different show back in the day then too. I think,
5909220	5914580	well, there is the OL archive, which is available on there, but, uh, I would say about the last four
5914580	5918660	or five years worth of show is still on the Orange Lounge Radio.com server. So all you need are links,
5918660	5924180	which are floating around out there. Uh, you can check that out. Uh, I do want to say hello to
5924180	5929940	Dark Sakura, uh, because, uh, she had to leave the show, as you know, in part A, uh, she unfortunately
5929940	5934580	got a little bit sick here on air, but she made it home during the break and she is in our chat room.
5934580	5938420	So for the live listeners, you will at least get to say hi to Dark Sakura. She's there in the chat
5938420	5943140	room and, uh, she does have her village open in Animal Crossing. If you want to go say hello to
5943140	5947460	her and, uh, hit her with a bug net. That's, you just have to beat the allergies out of her with
5947460	5952900	a bug net. So Misty, if you're available, the only way you need to, it's really the only way. All
5952900	5957940	right. Um, so we are here to talk more news and get to the mailbag and all that fun stuff.
5957940	5963060	Uh, let's do that right now with some rapid fire news. Loki. All right. So this was kind of a
5963060	5969700	surprise announcement out of the whole PlayStation for, uh, uh, their press conference that they had.
5969700	5977860	It was a reimagining of a game called Shadow of the Beast, which was an old, uh, side scroller,
5977860	5983780	I guess, for the Amiga. You know, I know that game. And so now it's this like at first glance,
5983780	5989540	you kind of go, oh, it's like Altered Beast, although no, but close enough, I guess. Yes.
5989540	5997060	And now it's coming to the PlayStation four. So that's interesting, I guess. Definitely not
5997060	6003540	something you would, you would guess would be coming. Um, game dev Tycoon is coming to steam
6004100	6010740	this, um, this week, actually, August 29th, and it will be getting an HD, well, sort of an HD,
6010740	6015940	a high res treatment. And if you haven't played game dev story, it was a game on the iOS
6015940	6023140	platform. Fantastic. You run a game development company and you make games and you make consoles
6023140	6031140	and it's just, it's one of those like kind of management Sims. It's a lot of fun. So, um,
6031220	6037620	check it out. Um, I'm sorry, I'm getting, um, that confused the game dev story. I'm sorry,
6037620	6042180	game dev Tycoon was the one that they offered up out there. Unfortunately, there was a couple of
6042180	6045460	them. There's a couple. I'm sorry. That was the one that I took a look at that first thing. They
6045460	6050740	were like, wait a second. That's the one they put up on Pirate Bay or whatever. Yeah, that's right.
6050740	6055540	Ironically, your company would go on, you couldn't win because your company would always go bankrupt
6055540	6060340	due to piracy and it was. Yeah, that's right. Nevermind. I'm sorry. But yeah, this game is
6060340	6064900	coming out, but you should go play game dev story if you haven't yet. And that's fantastic. It's
6064900	6070180	actually on, um, iOS and stuff. So you can check that out. Um, and if you want game dev story,
6070180	6074500	I guess. I don't know. I have to do that kind of move that they, you know, they're trying to
6074500	6079860	teach people a lesson. I think I'll teach them a lesson by not buying the game. Come on. It was
6079860	6092100	funny. I'm just not interested in it. And then I mean, come on. Uh, so Eurogamer, um,
6092100	6099540	kind of asked the question because it does beg to be asked, um, since, you know, last year and
6100420	6108500	wasn't very good because FIFA 13 on Vita and on the Wii was a reskin of FIFA 12.
6109300	6116900	So it begs the question, Hey guys, yay. Are you going to be putting out an actual
6117460	6123860	sequel to the game? Are you going to just reskin, you know, the game from last year? And so
6124580	6132660	EA sports came out with the best press or, you know, doctored press announcement ever. It was
6132660	6139780	FIFA 14, uh, for VITA has the same great gameplay compared to last year's entry. It's,
6139780	6147220	it's the same great gameplay and obviously with, um, any new kits. So basically it's the game that
6147220	6152740	it was last year, but they've reskinned it and added whatever team roster updates that they're
6152740	6162420	going to do. So literally roster update 2014 FIFA 14 is FIFA 13, which was FIFA 12. So fantastic that
6163300	6169300	the game has not changed as people would hope. You don't have to worry about that happening on
6169300	6172340	the Wii version or Wii U version because guess what? It's not coming out. They didn't make a
6172340	6177220	version for the Wii or Wii U. And same with Pro Evolution. Now, now to be fair, Pro Evolution
6177220	6181620	Soccer, same damn thing. They did that on the Wii. We do know that this year though, that is not the
6181620	6185460	case, at least with PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions, since those are using the Fox engine
6185460	6190500	now and everything. So, and I think it actually, uh, the FIFA is using their new engine, the
6190500	6196740	Ignite engine. So yeah. Uh, go to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com. Bobby Blackwolf,
6196740	6202020	having played both game dev games, wants you to know game dev tycoon is a lot deeper than game dev
6202020	6207460	story. Uh, a lot more difficult. Uh, Blackwolf also is telling other chatters that he's going
6207460	6212900	to make podcast network tycoon where you create a podcast network and have to deal with certain
6212900	6219940	listeners. I think you should make that game. It'll be a lot of fun. That's the next thing
6219940	6223860	VOG needs to get into game development because you don't do enough programming, Bobby. Let's
6223860	6230100	take on another project. Come on. Love it. All right. Um, let's move on to some more
6230100	6235380	rapid fire news. Uh, I'll do a couple stories here. One of them about Retro City Rampage on
6235380	6240020	the 3DS. I think we've talked before it is coming. Uh, they're actually going to have it playable at
6240020	6243780	PAX Prime, but this is interesting. You're not actually going to be able to play it in 3D at
6243780	6250740	PAX Prime. So, okay. Uh, however, uh, this will be the latest version of Retro City Rampage that
6250740	6256820	has the retro plus graphics mode that will double onscreen colors and add soft shadows to the game.
6256820	6262820	Uh, it is coming out on the 3DS eShop. So yeah. Is it going to be in 3D or is it just not the 3D?
6262820	6267540	I think the 3D version is not actually playable at PAX. That's what I'm gathering. But yeah,
6267540	6271220	it sounds like it will be in 3D, but I would imagine it's going to be pretty limited. I mean,
6271220	6275700	when you see the retro games in 3D, it's usually like one layer is this way and one layer. I
6275700	6281620	wouldn't expect, but who knows? You might, it might exceed those expectations. Remember,
6281620	6288100	this is all one guy making this too. That's very impressive. Yeah. Uh, more information for Super
6288100	6294420	Smash Brothers, whatever the new one might be called on the 3DS and the Wii U. Uh, a new
6294420	6299860	screenshot has revealed that there will be a stage based off of Metroid Other M. It's the pyrosphere
6299860	6303540	from Metroid Other M, which is a pleasant surprise because, you know, I know a lot of us
6303540	6309140	love Metroid. Metroid Other M on the other hand was a little more divisive, but, uh, I'm glad to
6309140	6313940	see that they are having a nod to this game, even though it wasn't as well received as other classic
6313940	6318180	games in the Metroid franchise. So that will be a stage available in the game based on a screenshot
6318180	6323620	that's out there showing Samus and Bowser doing battle while lava is shooting out of the
6323620	6327860	background. As expected in a Smash Brothers game, the backgrounds will fuck with you.
6328820	6335220	Also of note for Smash Brothers, Masahiro Sakurai has noted that in the 3DS version
6335220	6340900	of Smash Brothers, you can actually have outlines around the characters. And I believe this is to
6340900	6345860	help them stand out on the smaller screen. However, you don't have to do it. The mention
6345860	6350740	was that you can have thick outlines, thin outlines, or just turn them off.
6352260	6357220	Fans very interested in these when the pictures first came out. The lines are there to help you
6357220	6362820	see playable characters from the backgrounds and I would assume the various Pokemon that will show
6362820	6367620	up and the other assists that happen in the fight. It can get a little crazy on that tiny screen.
6367620	6374340	So, uh, I think that's great news. And I love, I love it when a developer, the more power they
6374340	6378980	put in the hands of the player, I mean not to, you know, use an old game cliche, but the more
6378980	6383540	customization that the player has to really make the game they want, I say the better. Instead of
6383540	6386260	saying, we're going to do this, we're going to put outlines and that's the way it's going to be.
6386260	6392180	Deal with it. So yeah, love that. Uh, a brand new expansion revealed for Diablo 3. We talked
6392180	6396660	about earlier in the show, Diablo 3. Well, an expansion has been announced. It's called Reaper
6396660	6402740	of Souls. Uh, it will have a new act in the game, five new levels and the Crusader class. It's a
6402740	6408900	Holy Knight, very similar to the Paladin in Diablo 2. Uh, also the loot system being overhauled.
6408900	6413460	They're going to call that loot 2.0. It has something called smart drop, meaning the items
6413460	6417620	that you get will actually be something your class can use. Although there will still be the
6417620	6423780	other classes because the idea is you trade and you have separate characters and so forth. Um,
6423780	6429460	also there's something called, uh, loot runs where you get a fully randomized dungeon with randomized
6429460	6434580	monsters and, uh, you kill lots of monsters and get lots of loot. Uh, Paragon system getting some
6434580	6440900	changes. No Paragon level cap in the Diablo 3 expansion. So there you go. No release date as
6440900	6446340	of yet, but Blizzcon is not that far away and I bet they'll have more to say at that time.
6446340	6450180	In the meantime, they're focusing a little more on the console versions of Diablo 3.
6451940	6456660	All right. Um, so few announcements. Uh, once again, this is going back to some of the Sony
6456660	6460660	stuff. Uh, Gran Turismo 6 is now coming out on December 6th, you know, so it's easy for you to
6460660	6467940	remember. And that would be on PlayStation 3 and they're going to have the most cars on disc of any
6468900	6474900	Gran Turismo game yet. And, uh, I guess if you pre-order it some places like the Evil G,
6474900	6480420	you may get some additional cars. And, uh, what I thought was interesting though,
6480420	6485300	they actually showed like a little bit of a trailer and stuff is that car companies are
6485300	6493140	developing, uh, prototype cars in Gran Turismo 6. Like they're making some of their prototypes
6493140	6498180	available to play as I thought that was kind of cool. I'm not really a heck of a sign of the
6498180	6502820	times. I'm not interested at all in Gran Turismo 6 because, you know, driving simulator, I'm just
6502820	6508500	terrible at arcade fine, but arcade fine, but yeah, I'm the exact same way. Like Mario, Mario
6508500	6514580	cart loved it. Blur was a great game. Here's something I would love Sony to do. Give me a
6514580	6522020	Forza Horizon version of Gran Turismo would be fantastic. Forza Horizon was really good.
6522820	6526020	You know, you give me something like that. Maybe that's what drive, no actually drive clubs,
6526020	6530820	I think a bit worse. I don't know what drive club is. I don't know what drive club is either.
6530820	6535140	I mean, uh, so I don't know if it's more simulation or more arcadey, but like give me an
6535140	6542820	arcade version kind of Gran Turismo 6 and that'd be pretty sweet. But anyways, yeah. Um, so that's
6542820	6550820	coming December 6. So far I might add the only game announced for December so far. Hmm. I still
6550820	6556580	think, I think Ubisoft is going to move South Park there and put in the Far Cry 3. Well, it's just
6556580	6560740	my own thought because last year the Far Cry 3 and it worked out really well for them. I thought
6560740	6565060	they pushed the South Park game back to next year. They did. They kind of hinted that that could be
6565060	6570420	a possibility because Matt Stone and Trey Parker kind of work on it on their own pace. Um, and
6570420	6576820	you're not going to get them to hurry up. So it's when it's done, I guess. Fair enough. Um, all
6576820	6583140	right. And then, uh, Pokemon X and Y, uh, the soundtrack will be coming out and it's coming on
6583140	6588820	four discs. That's a lot of tracks, 212 tracks to be exact, three and a half hours of music.
6589540	6599940	And it's available, I guess, um, on CD Japan for 2,500 yen. And, um, so yeah, that's, uh, not bad.
6601300	6609540	And then of course, ah, there, um, hasn't really been any good Capcom fighting games,
6609540	6617220	or I should say Street Fighter games on the Wii U. And, um, you know, Capcom's, oh no,
6617220	6623540	they're basically saying, nope, no Street Fighter on the Wii U. Um, they just, no plans to bring any
6623540	6630980	of the games, no plans for Ultra to come there. Um, so, uh, maybe Street Fighter 5, no idea.
6630980	6637060	However, there will be, um, some eShop versions of Street Fighter coming to the Wii U. Street
6637060	6641540	Fighter 2, they're coming out with, well, Street Fighter 2, Street Fighter 2 Turbo,
6641540	6648980	Super Street Fighter 2 will be out on, um, Virtual Console. So those are going to be $7.99 each.
6649860	6654340	If you miss your fighting game that only has eight playable characters,
6655540	6658740	at least you know this one's solid. Classic Street Fighter.
6658740	6661300	Yeah. Did they ever put out Killer Instinct on, uh...
6662180	6665780	I don't believe they did. But you know what I have sitting right over there?
6665780	6669460	A Super Nintendo. And you see that black cartridge lying on top of that?
6669460	6672660	That can only be one thing. So I'm not too worried.
6674660	6678340	All right, I gotta thank Alan for that, though. That's his Killer Instinct cartridge, not mine.
6678340	6684020	All right. All right, uh, let's get to, uh, the FUGL question of the week. You take Facebook,
6684020	6686100	you take Google, slam them together, you get FUGL.
6693540	6696580	Every week we ask a question of our Facebook community at facebook.com
6696580	6701220	slash Orange Lounge Radio and our Google Plus page over at plus.google.com slash
6701220	6704180	one one zero. No, I'm kidding. Just search for Orange Lounge Radio.
6704180	6708100	All right, uh, very simple question this week because most of the news this week,
6708180	6713220	most of the heavy-hitting news was centered around Sony's big press conference. We know the date.
6713220	6717780	We know the details. We pretty much know all there is to know about PlayStation 4's
6717780	6720900	launch at this point. Maybe a few surprises at a Tokyo game show.
6721380	6725460	Um, so what's the verdict? I figure most people have made up their mind.
6725460	6730340	What's the verdict on the PlayStation 4? Are you getting one? Why or why not?
6730900	6734500	Let's start with an answer on Google Plus from Jamie Mon, who says,
6734500	6738500	I was already sold on the PlayStation 4, but the fact that they came out of the box
6738500	6742100	with no shady online requirements and it's cheaper was a plus.
6742660	6746980	What they revealed this week wasn't anything to write home about, but didn't sway my opinion
6746980	6753780	either way. That being said, I plan on buying both systems at launch. Lucky guy. Lucky guy.
6754420	6761300	Uh, Black Dynamite says, getting one absolutely day one, no way. Using the show's golden rule,
6761300	6765860	a console is only as good as the games that are on it applies here. Any worthwhile game,
6765860	6769860	Grand Theft Auto 5, Call of Duty, Final Fantasy, et cetera, are coming out for current gen.
6769860	6773220	There's no real reason to get one unless you just want the latest and greatest,
6773220	6776580	which I believe is an answer that echoes where Loki's head is at right now, right?
6779060	6785460	I still probably will get one, but I, uh, Grand Theft Auto, man, that's, we'll see.
6785460	6790660	That's kind of where I'm at because I'm like, I still want one. And the gamer that has to
6790660	6796100	have all the new toys wants one, even just, and yes, I know the game. I love that you
6796100	6802340	invoked the golden rule of gaming and there's no games I'm dying for at launch, but I kind of want
6802340	6811860	that console still. To buy Grand Theft Auto 5. Seriously, you just need to do that. I will,
6811860	6816660	let me know what system Bobby's getting it on because at least I know I'm going to play against
6816660	6821620	you and get killed, but I can play against Bobby and we're about, you don't play against me. We're
6821620	6826900	in a crew. We go, we go do heists. Oh, okay. So it's like mass effect. We get a fog crew together
6826900	6832100	and we do heists. So it's just like mass effect. No, but mass effect is lame. I'm sorry. You're
6832100	6836900	supposed to say yes, because that gets me to buy it. All right, fine. Yes. It's like mass effect.
6836900	6842180	All right. Act F says I'm going to wait to see where the consoles go and what games really do
6842260	6848420	interest me on consoles. For now, I'll stick to my PC and my 3DS. Redertainment says no,
6849220	6853700	not because I don't want one, but because project buy a house takes priority. Well, real life
6853700	6859380	sometimes does. Tech EQ says yes, I will get a PlayStation 4 at launch. I need to trade in my 360
6859380	6863860	because it's gathering dust because I'm using my PS3 as my main console for gaming and video
6863860	6869700	streaming. The Evil G was offering 50% more in-store credit towards the PlayStation 4 in June.
6870420	6873780	Oh boy, all these incentives that Evil G is going to throw out there.
6873780	6878660	Just, I'm just going to throw this out there as a word of advice. Make sure you can't get a better
6878660	6884020	deal selling the thing directly if you're up for doing that. That's all I'm saying. That's all I'm
6884020	6888100	saying. Or if you're going to try to trade up, maybe, I mean, if you're going to be that hardcore
6888100	6894900	and buy the game on both platforms, maybe just show yourself a little restraint and not play the
6894900	6898820	game for a couple of weeks and just get it when it comes out on that platform. Because let's be
6898820	6901780	honest, there's a lot of stuff coming out in the fourth quarter and you don't need to buy
6901780	6908660	everything right away. SSJ100Matt in chat says Grand Theft Auto 5 VOD game nights will be great.
6908660	6913140	Yep. Yep. That is definitely going to happen. And you're going to be able to stream them, I hope.
6913140	6918740	Uh, I will. And then DarkSakura is in chat letting us still know her opinion. She says,
6918740	6924340	I've revised my rule. I have a new golden rule. Never buy a game system or an Apple product at
6924340	6931060	launch. You're no fun. No fun at all. All right, let's go to Facebook. Those are all our answers
6931060	6936260	from Google Plus. Let's do Facebook. Holy moly, 18 comments on Facebook. I'm going to try to do
6936260	6940820	this relatively quick. I apologize in advance. I may not read all of these. I'm going to try to
6940820	6946660	pick out people I don't usually see. Kertie K says, I won't be getting one this year. I'm not
6946660	6950820	looking forward to any of the launch titles so I can wait until at least next year to pick up one.
6951700	6956740	Burr says, I'm getting one but that's because I'm a consumer whore who has pre-ordered both systems.
6956740	6961380	However, I feel confident that the PlayStation 4 will be worth it just for whatever Naughty Dog
6961380	6967860	develops for it. Uh, Doug T says, I will be buying the PlayStation 4 day one. I love my PlayStation 3
6967860	6972020	and PlayStation Vita. I like Sony consoles better as they bring out more games that I like such as
6972020	6978100	RPGs. Brian G says, I will wait until there's a compelling reason for me to buy one. I have a
6978100	6984180	gaming PC and like Loki, Grand Theft Auto will keep me busy for a long time. Locopoco says,
6984180	6989380	I'll be getting one day one. Excited for Knack and Killzone also because I'm a consumer whore.
6991540	6996420	Renee, one of our buddies from Koopa Club says, I will not be getting a PS4 this year. Not because
6996420	7000420	I don't want it but because I'm not ready to make that monetary investment just yet.
7001300	7005620	Jeremy Jay also from Koopa Club says, I've pre-ordered my bundle with Watch Dogs.
7005620	7010260	I'm buying it because of Final Fantasy 15 much like I bought the PlayStation 3 originally for
7010260	7016900	Final Fantasy 13. Eddie K sounds like he's signing up for the Dark Sakura's new rule
7016900	7022260	saying, I generally never get a system at launch. I usually wait about 18 months because by that
7022260	7026500	time they've worked out most of the bugs in the system. There's a decent selection of titles you
7026500	7032660	actually want and by that time is usually when they do their first price drop. And uh, let's see,
7032660	7038100	a couple last answers here. Hitstun says, slow down. I don't even have a PlayStation 3 yet.
7038100	7043460	I still want to play Journey, Valkyria Chronicles and Tokyo Jungle. PlayStation 4 just doesn't have
7043460	7049220	any games I could get hyped about. And lastly, Codeman says, I cancelled my pre-order. I have
7049220	7054020	a PC but I just don't have the funds nor do I really need one right now. The only reason
7054020	7058660	are games that have sold this to me as Kingdom Hearts 3 and Final Fantasy 15. Although they are
7058660	7064020	developing Kingdom Hearts 3 on PC so there might be a PC build. I will wait just to let the dust
7064020	7070180	settle. And tacos. Some of the answers there from Facebook. I apologize I didn't read them all
7070180	7074500	just because there were so many answers. But I do encourage our listeners to check out the variety
7074500	7080820	of answers available on Facebook. Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio. And I did read them
7080820	7084660	all on Google tonight because there's just less people over there. But you can check out the full
7084660	7087700	answers. I did truncate some of the answers a little bit. You can check that out on our
7087780	7094020	Google Plus page. Thank you to everybody for responding. Let's get back into some more news.
7094020	7102900	Loki. Alright. So let's talk a little bit about the Xbox One. Europe. They made an announcement
7102900	7108420	that, hey, we're gonna get you to buy the Xbox One because we know what you Europeans like.
7108420	7113620	You like FIFA. So you get FIFA. You get FIFA. You get FIFA. You get FIFA. You get FIFA. Everybody
7113620	7122500	gets FIFA 14 with the Xbox One and and the soundtracks by Adele. Go figure to try and
7122500	7134660	get more sales. It's a joke. Yeah, I got that. So, yes, it will be also available on Xbox 360.
7134660	7145460	You can get a bundle as well for 199 Euro. So, yeah. So FIFA. FIFA 14. That's how they're
7145460	7153300	gonna sell it to you. Cool. It's interesting that it's a third party game. That's the part
7153300	7157060	that gets me like I'm like, wow, it's a third party. I mean, it really does sweeten the deal,
7157060	7160900	though. I mean, with the fact that the console's, you know, $100 more expensive,
7161620	7167300	it goes a long way to put a game in there to give that extra value. I realize the game is only 60
7167300	7170740	bucks. But remember, connect and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Whether you like it or not,
7170740	7175860	that is all stuff that's coming with it, which FIFA 14 does not. I don't believe uses connect.
7175860	7179620	Well, well, I don't know if it uses connect because they don't say anymore. A lot of the
7179620	7184900	Xbox One games aren't right away. Let's be there. There's some. But, you know, there's a lot that
7184900	7191140	aren't. At least if what we saw at E3 is to be any. I mean, they use it on the 360. Let's assume
7191140	7195540	that the features for the connect are going to be pretty similar on the Xbox One as they are on the
7195540	7202340	Xbox 360. So the advantage that you get with the Xbox One is you paid $100 more for that stupid
7202900	7208900	camera and they're going to penalize you for swearing at the game. So count me in.
7210100	7213380	Yeah, that's not going to work in my house. Like just just the other night,
7213380	7217700	actually one game I've been playing a lot of this week, Bit.Trip Runner 2.
7217700	7220580	I didn't talk about this in my gaming week. Oh, yeah, that's free, isn't it?
7220580	7225460	It's free on PlayStation Plus. I bought it months ago on Wii U, but I was like,
7225460	7230260	well, shit, it's free and I want trophies. So I'm going to play it again. And every time I'm
7230260	7239780	playing that game, doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo. Fuck! God damn it! All the way back to the
7239780	7246100	beginning of the level. Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo. God! That's me playing Bit.Trip.
7246820	7254260	So I don't need the connect penalizing me further for swearing. Although I think a lot of that is
7254260	7259300	obviously overdone. Come on. What connect games are really going to penalize you for swearing
7259300	7262180	unless it's like Sesame Street adventures? They're going to throw. Yeah, they're going to
7262180	7268740	card you in the game or flag you, I guess. Yeah, I don't know. It seems kind of lame
7268740	7273540	that they have that as an option. And that's that's the best you could come up with for
7273540	7278740	connect is that a lot of stuff. Yeah, that doesn't make any sense to me. Well, in Europe,
7278740	7282660	that's a huge deal. That's like Mario Brothers. No, I'm not knocking that. You know, they're
7282660	7287140	bringing in. That's a big thing for I'm talking about connect. Like what they're using it for is
7287140	7291540	just like a lot of this voice recognition stuff that I think you could probably do just fine with
7292180	7297780	a headset. So I don't understand why they need a whole thing to watch you
7299700	7306820	to do this, you know, voice stuff. All right. Well, some other big Microsoft news this week.
7306820	7311540	I'm sure many of you have heard that the current CEO of Microsoft, Steve Ballmer,
7311540	7318660	no, Bill Gates is not CEO. It's actually Steve Ballmer is the Microsoft CEO. He will be retiring
7318660	7323540	from that position over the next 12 months. Don't know exactly when I would imagine a lot of that
7323540	7329380	depends on when they figure out who is going to be replacing him and how well the Xbox one does.
7330340	7334580	I don't know about retirement. The problem is people were already criticizing Steve Ballmer
7334580	7339860	and it's not necessarily related to the Xbox one because like you said, I'm not out yet. Windows 8.
7340580	7346580	It's that in the tablets. Windows surface. Yeah, the tablets, the phones, they haven't really been
7346580	7350740	doing as well as they should have been. So yeah, unfortunately you get a lot of that stuff and
7351780	7357220	the stockholders are saying maybe it's time for somebody else. There is a panel put together to
7357220	7364180	try and find a replacement. Now the panel includes Bill Gates, Chuck Noski, Steven Luxo also on that
7364180	7369380	panel. So yeah, if you're interested, just give Bill Gates a call and let them know you're
7369380	7373380	interested in the position. Although I kind of think they'll probably be looking, you know, at
7373380	7380340	other big companies, tech companies. Here's where I insert my fan wank that they should hire Reggie
7380340	7388980	Fils-Aime. Come on guys. How do you like that fan wank? No, we're talking about, for one, Reggie's
7388980	7394020	obviously a very game focused company. When we talk about the Microsoft CEO, that is much more
7394020	7401220	than just Xbox. Maybe they'll promote from within. Kind of like how, you know, what they did when
7401220	7406980	Don Mattrick left. You know what they need to do. And I know that this would probably violate some
7406980	7411700	contracts and stuff, but they need to hire fictional character Kevin Butler
7413220	7416740	as president of Microsoft because it would be awesome.
7419460	7426180	Is there anybody that jumps out at you who could be the person to jump in as CEO?
7427140	7427620	No.
7428580	7430020	Well, you know what they, you know what else they could-
7430020	7430500	Clippy.
7431540	7432100	Clippy B.
7433380	7439140	Oh, Clippy, the Microsoft office assistant. Yes. Well, you know what they could do in
7439140	7445780	good old American tradition to find the new CEO of Microsoft? Reality TV show.
7448980	7453380	This is Microsoft's Idol. America voted.
7456660	7459300	Anyhow, another show for Seacrest to host. Come on.
7460260	7461060	He doesn't need work.
7461940	7467060	No, he's going to be hosting an NBC game show coming up. The million second quiz,
7467060	7471140	which is, and I know, God, I can't believe I'm going to admit this. There's an app that's
7471140	7472420	available- That's a pretty long time.
7472420	7475300	There's an app that's available. It's 11 days, a million seconds.
7475860	7477460	Yeah, I know. That's a pretty long time.
7477460	7481540	Well, they're trying to make it an event game show. Remember when Who Wants to Be a Millionaire
7482020	7486340	I love game shows. So remember when Who Wants to Be a Millionaire first came out on ABC,
7486340	7492500	it was a big fucking deal, right? The original Regis hosted one when the guy won the million
7492500	7497060	dollars and used his lifeline to call his dad. Like that was like epic television, right?
7497060	7497380	Yeah.
7497380	7500420	There was event television. That's what NBC is trying to try to make that happen again.
7500420	7503140	Cause it's been a while since we've really had, you know, Who Wants to Be a Millionaire
7503140	7507700	has kind of faded away into a, I shouldn't say faded away because now it's like a syndicated
7507700	7510660	game show, like your Jeopardy, like your Wheel of Fortune, you know, it's there.
7510660	7514020	But NBC is trying to make this event game show happen again.
7514020	7518020	And we've seen other networks try this. Like ABC had one a couple of years ago called Dual.
7518020	7520580	It was a pretty decent game, but it just didn't really take off.
7520580	7524900	Yeah. It really needs to be based off the Stephen King novel in order to like be interesting.
7524900	7528180	Well, NBC has got this million second quiz and it's going to be hosted by Seacrest. Well,
7528180	7531780	okay. Remember back in the day with Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, part of the reason everybody
7531780	7537460	was so like crazy about it is because the way you entered was you could call a telephone line and
7537460	7541620	play a game. And if you were good at the game, you might get flown to New York and go on the
7541620	7545700	show. Right. And I think they had a thing at McDonald's too. I want to say it was many years
7545700	7552020	ago. Yeah. Remember the telephone. Okay. Well now what was that? 1999. So here we are 14 years
7552020	7556820	later. Now it's an iPad app. So you can actually download the million second quiz iPad app. And I'm
7556820	7562100	maybe guilty of having played this, but you get matched up against other people and you take a
7562100	7567060	10 question quiz. It's all multiple choice. And it's like a mixture of like the same thing you
7567060	7571380	would expect to see on Trivial Pursuit cards. Right. And you have to pick the answer. Well,
7571380	7575540	supposedly, and I don't know how this is going to work, but if you hit a certain benchmark score
7575540	7582500	in the iPad app, you qualify as a line jumper to go beyond the real show when it debuts,
7582500	7587700	I think in a week or two. I think it's coming up here pretty soon. All right. Good. Now when they
7587700	7592980	say, Oh, you might, you might win money, like a million billion dollars or however much they're
7592980	7597060	giving away a few thousand. I'm not, but I, but that's, that's how they get, that's how they make
7597060	7603780	it event television by saying you Johnny America sitting at home with your iPad, get the app now,
7603780	7610020	and you can be here sitting and winning all this money in a couple weeks or whatever. Pretty good
7610020	7617140	idea. How did talking about Steve Ballmer leave us to talking about NBC game shows? I don't know,
7617140	7621860	but I agree with code man in the chat room who says, at least it's not candy crush,
7621860	7625780	true facts deleted that from my phone. Thank you very much. That was embarrassing. Sorry about
7625780	7632100	that. I, I bet you anything. Yeah. There will be a candy crush theme game show at some point.
7632100	7636900	Cause wasn't there like a Hasbro themed game show? Yes, there still is. There's still the family
7636900	7643700	game night. Yes. Family game night. So act deft and chat says, imagine if Rob gets on that game
7643700	7648740	show. Yes, please. But, uh, it would also be nice if I won some money because then like, you know,
7648740	7654020	if I win enough money, I could possibly leave my day job and do vog full time. Wouldn't that be
7654020	7661620	fun? If I could win a million dollars. Huh? All right. Forget it. Moving on more news.
7662180	7670260	All right. So, uh, Humble Bundle, um, the Origin Bundle has earned a record breaking $8.7 million.
7671140	7681780	And that was based on 1.791 million bundles, uh, being sold and, um, average price 486.
7683620	7692740	And, uh, I guess the record previous to that was 5.1 million, um, with the Humble Indie Bundle 5.
7694260	7698180	And, uh, they did add a few more games. They added command and conquer red alert,
7698180	7703540	three uprising, not red alert three, which would have been an awesome game,
7703540	7709460	but red alert three uprising, a four level ex standalone expansion. Boo.
7710340	7717140	Act deft and check correcting you, by the way, it's over 9 million now. I don't want to, uh,
7717140	7726180	populace and yes. And, um, I think that was it. Yeah. I love the fact, by the way,
7726180	7731860	even though populace, you have to get it through origin, whatever it's, um, that's like the classic
7731860	7735300	game back from like, when did that game come out? Like 1989. It was on super Nintendo.
7735940	7741380	And, um, that game was awesome. Um, and I was very happy that they threw that in the bundle as well.
7741380	7746260	And what's so funny about it is because the game is so old origin actually has these prompts that
7746260	7752740	says, okay, you are about to play an old game. And back in the day, there was no way to quit
7752740	7756580	an old game. So if you need to quit the game, you all tab when you all tab out of the game,
7756580	7760180	you quit the game. Cause remember the old PC get, you just power off your PC to quit them.
7760180	7765940	There was no like way to exit populace. There's no exit, not in populace. Well,
7765940	7771780	they didn't program it very well then you can quit the DOS. I mean, DOS. And then also,
7771780	7777060	this is the funny thing. Remember how games back in the day, the copy protection was the manual.
7777060	7781780	What is the third word on page 45 of the manual or use this chart in the back of the man? So that
7781860	7786420	was in populace. You had to identify these crests in the game. So that's still in there,
7786420	7791700	but they fixed it so that it says you can input any word and the game will accept it as the
7791700	7797300	correct answer. So like, what does this shield mean? Boobs. And it'll take it. That's correct.
7799780	7806420	There you go. Yeah. All right. All right. And then, um, something else about origin.
7806900	7814260	They're now allowing returns now returns with an asterisk. Basically what's going to happen is if
7814260	7822340	you buy a game on origin and they have this now great game guarantee, if you're unsatisfied with
7822340	7828580	your full game, a digital download from origin, and this includes full games on pre-order and,
7828580	7834740	you know, other discounts and stuff, I believe you'll be able to return it within seven days.
7836580	7846660	So seven days after purchase without activation or 24 hours after launching it for the first time.
7846660	7850260	So 24 hours if you've activated seven days, if you haven't activated the game.
7851860	7858020	Interesting to see origin and EA really making these big customer service grabs between the
7858020	7862100	humble bundle and the great thing they're doing for charity. And I hate to make that
7862180	7867700	sound opportunistic, but the reality is it's, it was opportunistic. Well, it's putting a lot of
7867700	7876740	people in origins, good graces right now. And now this, which is hard to say this isn't good news.
7876740	7882500	I think it's great. It isn't, it isn't terrible. It's not bad news. It's good news. Um, you know,
7882500	7888820	it's, it's good that they have the option in there. Um, and it's good to like, you know,
7888820	7892980	for a few reasons. One, if you run into a situation like SIM city where the whole launch
7892980	7898180	was fucked up, you know, you can get your money back, which is kind of cool. Or for example,
7898180	7904180	like if you buy a game that just doesn't run well on your PC, then you can get your money back.
7904180	7908660	So that's pretty good. Or you just don't like it. Yeah. Or you just don't like it. So I think
7908660	7912660	that's kind of cool that they have that in there. I wish steam would do something similar, but it's,
7912660	7918660	let's, let's be honest here. This is far and away from like, you know, I'm selling a used
7918660	7922900	copy of my game that I finished or something like that. This is, this is not anything like that.
7922900	7929380	This is just kind of like that. Oh, almost like the, the evil G use game thing where it's like,
7929380	7933460	okay, within seven days you can return this, you know, except, you know, seven days without
7933460	7939060	playing it. Um, so I'll give them props for at least having some sort of return.
7940020	7944420	Well, you said in there in passing, you said, I wish steam would do something like this because
7944420	7946820	yeah, they don't really do refunds on steam unless there's a huge, I mean,
7946820	7952340	they've done it before, but it was like a huge thing. But, uh, this whole competition now,
7952340	7956580	you know, if origin does get more and more market share, it's going to force steam to look into
7956580	7961780	doing these types of things. Yeah. For, uh, you know, to, to make themselves competitive.
7961780	7964900	It's interesting. I don't know if they'll have to do that because I think what's going to end
7964900	7969460	up happening is they're probably going to come out with some sort of way to sell or trade your
7969460	7973300	game online using their services. I think that's what's going to end up happening there. So they
7973300	7982740	may not have like, you know, the whole returns thing. So I think this is a good direction. I
7982740	7986900	mean, I can't say I'm going to go buy a bunch of games and then return them, but it does take that
7986900	7991140	awkwardness out of returning things too. Like, I don't know. I just don't like to go back to the
7991140	7995860	store and return something as I feel like that guy, unless it's like very clearly broken or
7995860	8002660	whatever. Like I just, who likes to be that guy? Well, some people do, but anyway. Uh, well, you
8002660	8009460	can be any guy or gal you want to be in a series known as Fable and Fable Legends is a new game.
8010260	8014420	It's a multiplayer game that's set in the universe of the other Fable games, Albion.
8015060	8020820	It was announced at Gamescom. There will be a beta test actually happening next year. So not
8020820	8028420	to be outdone by say Elder Scrolls Online on the PlayStation. Xbox will have Fable Legends. No
8028420	8032900	release window for the game currently, but I would imagine if they're going to beta test it next year,
8032900	8036900	no later than holiday next year. Holiday next year would be my guess. You can sign up on the
8036900	8041140	game's website if you're interested in more information, fablelegends.com. And there's
8041140	8043940	like a little trailer and you can see all the other stuff they put out at Gamescom. It looked
8043940	8049220	neat, but I'm sorry. After playing the last few Fable games, it's just, it's always so much hype
8049220	8054100	and then they play, especially if they have Peter Molyneux talking about Fable. Oh my God.
8054660	8058420	You know, they just hype it up so much and it's just kind of like, yeah, this is kind of very
8058420	8063140	similar to the last Fable game. Um, so I don't know. It looks all right, but I mean, it'd be
8063140	8067300	something my wife would be into. I'm not buying it. She loved the Fable games, didn't she? I'm
8067300	8071700	not buying an Xbox one for that game, but you know, my wife would probably be interested.
8071700	8075220	I forgot. She, she really liked the Fable games, huh? Yeah, she plays through. Cause she like,
8075620	8079700	she liked to do really weird things in them, didn't she? Not really. I thought that's what,
8079700	8085220	I thought that's what it was. No. Does she play them good or evil? Good. Usually she tries to.
8085220	8091620	That's, that's good. All right. Well, let's see if our emailers this week are good or evil in
8091620	8098580	a segment we do every week here on the show called the Mailbag. Mailbag at orangelaungerator.com is
8098580	8104900	the place to send us emails each and every week. And, uh, in the absence of dark Sakura tonight,
8104900	8110340	I will dive into the mailbag head first. Ooh. And, uh, oh my gosh, it's pretty empty in here,
8110980	8114980	but at the very, very, very bottom of this mailbag, whoop, way down there at the bottom,
8115540	8120820	one email here for me to read tonight. Yeah. One email. Well, you know what? It's kind of a long
8120820	8125700	email, so it'll work. Uh, if you want to email us for a future week, you know what? When dark
8125700	8130820	soccer gets back and she's over allergies and all that, let's make her work. Give us like 10 emails
8130820	8136740	for next week. If you can send 10 emails from 10 different people, I will get dark Sakura a taco.
8137780	8142660	Remember that bet. All right. Uh, Ragenator is our emailer tonight and here we go.
8143380	8148180	Uh, I think that we all in the VoG community have at least one thing in common. We're all gamers.
8149620	8156580	I'm gonna, I'm gonna actually stop you right there. VoG is actually the voice of Geeks Network.
8156580	8165060	Now I think most of the people do play some games, but like not, well, certainly not every
8165060	8170500	show on VoG is about games. Um, and we, I think we do have a couple hosts who maybe don't play
8170500	8175220	nearly as many video games as the rest of us do. So please, please do make that a note, even though
8175220	8181780	OLR, Bobby Black Wolf, Girls Gone Wow, you know, we're, we're all strictly about video games.
8181780	8187220	Understation Live dabbles in it, Pod Culture dabbles in it. Uh, they are not strictly video
8187220	8193380	games, but anyhow, I think you would be right in saying gaming is one big part of geek culture.
8194100	8199540	Anyhow, he goes on to say, granted the reasons why we're gamers may be vastly different,
8199540	8203860	but nonetheless, we're gamers. That being said, I'd like to pose this question to the three of
8203860	8210500	you as well as the VoG community as a whole. Why gaming? What draws you to the hobby as opposed
8210500	8214340	to some other hobby as opposed to something like, I don't know, underwater basket weaving?
8214900	8219380	I'm positive that there has to be some sort of motivation behind it. Is it major or minor or
8219380	8225540	people wouldn't do it? For me, my original reason from 1981 was the novelty of video games. Before I
8225540	8231060	discovered video games, I could only turn a TV on or off, change the volume or change the channel.
8231060	8235700	I could not have direct control of anything that actually happened on the screen. Video games
8235700	8240340	changed that. Over the past 32 years, my motivations evolved into two things. One,
8240340	8244500	regardless of the game I'm playing, be it Call of Duty, Madden, Mortal Kombat or whatever,
8244500	8250180	I'm essentially getting mental exercise. I have to learn patterns in AI or stage layouts, anticipate
8250180	8255300	what an opponent may do, etc. and base my strategy around that as well as tweak my strategy via the
8255300	8260820	trial and error method. Video games, in a sense, are just the next evolution of a chess game.
8260820	8266420	My second reason is that my real life is extremely boring 99.9% of the time. However,
8266420	8271780	no matter how boring real life gets, things change a tad when I play a game. For that little while
8271780	8275380	I'm playing a game, I'm not some schmuck that really can't afford to go out much and doesn't
8275380	8279460	get invited to do anything. Rather, for that little while that I'm playing a game, I'm the world's
8279460	8284260	greatest athlete. I'm the guy that saves the world and gets the girl. I'm the guy that single-handedly
8284260	8289140	stops a terrorist plot. I get to visit worlds, real fictional or a blending of real and fictional,
8289140	8293780	that there's zero chance in real life of visiting. I get to have really amazing adventures as a
8293780	8299380	result of video games. This email has been brought to you by Bobby's googly-eyed Oculus Rift. Now,
8299380	8304020	if only Dark Soccer, I can get him to use the damn thing to play Mass Effect. Garris all the things.
8304740	8313940	That email again from Raginator. So, the question from Raginator, why gaming? I'll ask Loki here in
8313940	8318180	a minute here. Let me read some of the answers from Ch- no, no, let me go to Loki, actually.
8318180	8326500	Loki, why gaming? I don't know. Why do you play video games? Because they're fun. It's just,
8326500	8331780	it's just a medium, I guess, to play. I mean, it's just like, if you were to play with Legos,
8331780	8337460	or if you were to draw, or you're gonna do something else. I mean, just, I don't know,
8337460	8342420	it's just what I ended up doing. You know, it's what I started off early with, like, you know,
8342420	8347460	PC games and stuff. And, you know, I did other things other than just, you know,
8349140	8353860	like, I had, you know, blocks. I was into a lot of weird hobbies. Well, not weird hobbies,
8353860	8359140	as in, I used to collect hobbies almost. It was like, you know, rock collecting, or, you know,
8360580	8367540	baseball cards, comic books, you know, all sorts of stuff. And it's just like, for some reason,
8367540	8371860	you know, it's just something that we do nowadays. It's like, why watch TV? Why listen to the radio?
8371860	8377780	I mean, it's to the point now where video games are kind of like watching TV. It's that common.
8377780	8382900	It's not really, it's like, why eat food? I mean. That was a little bit me too. Like,
8382900	8385860	if you go back to like my senior year of high school, and you look at me in the yearbook,
8385860	8390580	I'm like in like six different clubs, and that doesn't even count. Like, I used to do a public
8390580	8394580	access TV show. A lot of people don't know about this, because I don't want Travis Donovan ever
8394580	8400260	finding the tapes of it, because God knows what'll happen. But, you know, I was doing all this
8400260	8405060	stuff, like when I was a kid. And I think a lot of that was just because, I don't know if it was
8405060	8408740	out of boredom, or just out of the fact like, you know, when I was sitting at home doing nothing,
8408740	8413380	I just felt really depressed. So I had to kind of get out and do these different things. And I just
8413380	8418260	almost overdid it. And video games, to some extension, were a real social thing at that age.
8418980	8423860	I think the reason why I got into it, to answer the question, actually very similar to what
8424580	8428180	Rage Nator said at the beginning there. Being able to kind of control the pictures on the TV,
8428740	8432740	I think was a real kind of novel thing, when you're like six years old, five years old,
8432740	8439220	and very impressionable. So I'm going to the chat room, and some of the answers there. Let's see.
8442100	8450100	Brad from Pod Culture says, why not gaming? Black Wolf says, I don't do underwater basket weaving,
8450100	8456900	because I don't have a pool. There is no place to practice. But a game console is cheaper than
8456900	8463140	a backyard pool. Degenerate Johnny says, why gaming? Because it makes me harder than Peter
8463140	8471620	North in a bukkake festival. What? What? Where every gamer has a voice, I guess. SSJ100Matt
8471620	8476420	with a far more serious answer saying, escapism is the theme, is the thing for some people.
8477060	8482020	Certainly. Well, Dark Sakura is still listening to the show. And she sent an answer over private
8482020	8485300	message here, because if she were here, I'd ask her what she says. So she told me over chat,
8485300	8489860	she says, I had a rotten childhood, and I would hide in books. Having a visual outlet,
8489860	8494900	a world to get involved with would occupy my mind in a way that a book could not, because my eyes
8494900	8500180	and ears were also engaged. Later on, I found out that as I am autistic, it gives me a very strong
8500180	8505620	focus, especially if my senses have been otherwise overwhelmed. I've often broken myself out of a
8505620	8512180	meltdown that way. Also, it's how I met my husband. As far as why I like it over another medium,
8512180	8516900	it's that again, that process of immersion, having an active hand in what happens in the game
8516900	8525060	makes it a lot better than being a passive participant. So there you go. Yeah, I think,
8525060	8531300	you know, I use this, this kind of example today is like, some of my friends asked me like,
8531300	8535780	wow, you play a lot of World of Warcraft. Aren't you addicted? Are you addicted to World of
8535780	8541620	Warcraft? And then I go, well, have you spent your free time? You've watched every single episode of
8541620	8547460	Lost twice. Are you addicted? Are you addicted to Lost? Game of Thrones? Are you addicted to that?
8547460	8552420	TV tells me that you're addicted to, wow, because you can't just like it. You must be addicted.
8553140	8557780	TV, TV. So yeah, it's like, yeah, I may play a lot of video games, but if you ask me like,
8557780	8565300	what movies I've seen lately, I see maybe 10% of what I really want to see. I just saw the first
8565300	8570980	half of Planes yesterday. And you asked me about TV shows. I'm especially clueless. The fact that
8570980	8576340	I watched Orange is the New Black from start to finish says a lot about that show because there's
8576340	8585460	very few shows I've watched from start to finish. Very few. So there you go. All right. That's it.
8585460	8590900	That was the only email tonight. So mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com if you would like to send
8590900	8596740	us an email for a future week. In the meantime, let's get to the FUs of the week. And this is
8596740	8617140	the part of the show where we give our angst. Well, Loki, would you like to start us off
8617140	8624980	tonight? Yes. Big fuck you to cyclists because you're always in my goddamn way on the street.
8624980	8629220	There's this guy that was in front of me today, you know, not in a bike lane or anything, just
8629220	8633940	kind of in the middle of the goddamn street, riding his bike super goddamn slow. I didn't
8633940	8639060	go around him because if I go try to, you know, share the lane with him and go around him, then
8639060	8646340	I might hit him and that would be bad. So yeah, fuck that. And also what is up with all these
8646340	8652100	people? I know that you're not on a fucking team practicing for the race, but wearing your stupid
8652820	8660820	skin tight, you know, uniforms with all your sponsors on there. I'm sorry, but no fat dude
8660820	8665460	wearing that. You do not have sponsors. You're not in a race. You're not practicing for a race.
8665460	8670420	I don't understand it. My boss has like a group of people that he rides with and they all have like
8670980	8676100	gene uniforms and stuff. It's ridiculous. You're not in races. Okay. You don't have sponsors.
8676900	8683060	What the hell? All right. Uh, dark Sakura sending her FUs, uh, by private messages.
8683060	8686580	She wants you all to know FU to my fucking sinuses, which makes sense.
8686580	8694980	Uh, and $115 school books for one fucking class. Oh my God. A lot of money. Um, my FU of the week
8694980	8703140	goes to construction on highway 80 between Vacaville and Dixon. You suck. And I realized,
8703220	8710180	look, construction workers don't hard construction workers work hard. I don't blame you personally.
8710180	8713860	I know you have to do that stuff, but here's the thing that pissed me off about it is that there
8713860	8721780	was no warning. If you know traffic is going to be backed up at one 30 in the morning for one hour,
8721780	8728340	have a goddamn sign 20 miles up the road that says severe congestion on highway 80 due to
8728340	8734100	construction. You built all these freaking Amber alert signs that only thankfully have
8734100	8739220	to be used once in a blue moon. How about showing us traffic updates on those fucking things
8739220	8744020	instead of, you know, nothing, which is what they show when there isn't, unfortunately some child
8744020	8749780	who's been kidnapped. I would have sympathy if, if they chose to show a abducted child message
8749780	8754340	over a construction message, I'd be okay with that, but to show nothing at all that warns me,
8754340	8760500	Hey, try taking a back road is a little bit here. You didn't know that that this month is,
8761300	8765700	you know, California repaved the road month. It's spare the air day tomorrow. God,
8771140	8777780	anyhow movie. Yeah. Or click it or ticket or what else did they put on those Amber alert signs that
8777780	8781940	have nothing to do with their purpose? Uh, report drunk drivers report drunk drive, which will,
8781940	8786740	you know, it's some of the, I know a lot of this stuff is important and I'm not trying to belittle
8786740	8794100	it, but I sometimes feel like when they do this, they it's it's like when the text message remember
8794100	8798100	when they sent the Amber alert text message to everybody at two in the morning, the, about the
8798100	8803860	kid that got kidnapped, tons of people disabled it right after that. Why did they do that? Are they,
8803860	8810980	are they just, are they assholes that don't care about kids? No, it's because that hideous thing
8810980	8817060	showed up on people's phones at two in the morning going like, it's like a freaking fire
8817060	8821380	alarm going off in your house. It scared the living hell out of people. Like how about a
8821380	8828660	little heads up a little warning. So unfortunately it's like when you, when you shoehorn things
8829860	8834820	that were intended for this other purpose, it's people get desensitized to it and the same thing
8834820	8842100	is happening with those signs. Anyhow. Sorry. I didn't mean to get on my soap box, but I guess
8842100	8846900	that's what the F is the weaker for. Right. Yep. All right. All right. So there's a rumor. Well,
8846900	8851380	it's actually probably not, it's actually not a rumor anymore. There was a rumor that, um,
8852580	8856980	there was going to be a special 32 gigabyte Wii U bundle that was going to have the legends of
8856980	8864740	the Wind Waker HD. Why I say it's not a rumor anymore because Nintendo. Thank you, Nintendo.
8864900	8870740	Apparently Nintendo had a brand new trailer that they released and then quickly pulled off
8870740	8877620	the internet, um, that showed off the new hero mode. And then at the end of the trailer also
8877620	8882900	announced the bundle that was going to be coming out. And, uh, thankfully there are some people
8882900	8888100	that took screen caps and what is this new bundle going to have in it? Well, it's basically a, uh,
8888180	8895220	Wii U, um, black Wii U system with the game pad, having what looks like a decal on it with some,
8895220	8901620	um, you know, the Zelda, like flourishes and stuff. There was like some little bit of gold.
8902180	8907540	Um, I don't even know what the hell you would call it, like a gold emblem on it and stuff.
8907540	8913700	And, um, it comes with special unique things. So yeah, it's sticker. Okay. And then it comes
8913700	8923460	with Wind Waker HD for $349.99. Cool, but it's still $349.99 is my thing. And when you consider
8923460	8930580	that the PlayStation 4 is only $50 more, it, that's a kind of a hard sell. Also when like
8930580	8937380	other systems like the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3 are $199, that's a lot of games you can buy
8937380	8942500	in between that. Granted, it's not Zelda, but this is not technically a new Zelda either.
8942500	8949460	It is an HD remake that you're trying to pass off. Trying, trying to convince people to buy
8949460	8956500	system for like it's a brand new Zelda, which it's not. I'm sure they'll announce said brand
8956500	8962020	new Zelda next year, but there's still got a ways to go. If you put a demo for brand new Zelda on
8962020	8969060	that disc, then you're talking. Yeah, that's true. Then those things will go flying. So.
8970020	8976420	All right. Well, unfortunately, some sad news to end on tonight. And that has to do with a
8976420	8985140	studio closure. Seattle based studio Big Fish has gone through a round of layoffs. It is closing
8985140	8991700	its Vancouver studio and has gone into a 30 day consultation period about its Cork, Ireland
8991700	8997940	operations. CEO Paul Thelen sent a letter to staff that talked about the changes, that talked about
8997940	9005780	49 layoffs in its Seattle headquarters and another 70 employees re-aligned. 524 full-time employees
9005780	9011140	in Seattle previously, 9% of the studio cut. Quote, I want to stress that our decisions are
9011140	9015060	not based on company-wide performance or that of the people working on these initiatives,
9015060	9020580	both of which are strong, but because of where the market is growing and quite frankly, where it is
9020580	9025060	not. The most significant decision we are making today is that we are discontinuing our premium
9025060	9030500	cloud delivery business. This service is not growing as fast as we had hoped it would and is
9030500	9036180	not on a path to profitability. And this is why I'm guessing probably most of you have not heard
9036180	9042100	of Big Fish because one of their big things was streaming casual games, was one of their big
9042100	9048580	markets. They had Big Fish Unlimited that would do all these casual style adventure games. Yeah,
9048580	9053460	I recognize them just because I used to set up a lot of their games and remember the mystery case
9053460	9059220	file games that they had and yeah, I mean, mainly mystery case files because they did have a few of
9059220	9067620	them on the Wii and the DS. Right. So, even though we might not play as many casual games here at
9067620	9073300	OLR, it's always sad to hear about studio closures, so good luck to all those affected employees.
9073300	9078660	That's never fun to report on. Hopefully, we'll have a new studio like we've heard about in other
9078660	9085060	cases. So, that does it for news tonight. We're gonna open up the Skype line. It is time for us to
9085060	9090580	open up the Skype line and get some calls. Our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio, or you can
9090580	9097060	still call us on the good old telephone, 1-877-GAME-OLR is where you can call us.
9098100	9103940	OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word on Skype. Speaking of calls, there's this weird new thing happening
9103940	9107780	on Skype. I don't know if I should talk about it, but I think we're getting like spam voicemails.
9107780	9111300	Like, I seriously had like seven voicemails throughout the week from random numbers,
9111300	9115780	but I would try to click play because I thought, oh, maybe somebody's actually leaving us a bumper.
9115780	9119940	Maybe it's actually a new listener, but I click play and nothing happens. And then I go, it's
9119940	9124420	probably there. All the voicemails are the same length. They're all four minutes and 22 seconds.
9124420	9129860	And I'm like, that's probably spam. Probably tell me to go to some website and put in my
9129860	9137460	social security number for a chance at some credit card or something. Oh, lame. All right. Well,
9137460	9141060	somebody's calling in on the phone right now. So let's see what happens when we pick up the phone
9141060	9146740	and go to it. Hi, OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this? Hey, it's Jim Sally, guys. Hey, Jim Sally,
9146740	9152580	what's up, buddy? I totally forgot. You guys have an old school telephone, man, sitting on your show.
9152580	9155620	We do have the old school telephone sitting on the show. That's why I was surprised to
9155620	9159860	hear from you on it, because usually you call us on Skype. Were you just wanting to test that
9159860	9166180	it still worked? No, I was outside of my garage and the Skype lady was saying she didn't like
9166180	9171300	my Skype. Oh, I'm sorry, man. I don't want to call you and be all choppy on the Skype line.
9172180	9176820	So, Jim Sally, to what do we owe this phone call tonight? I was going to give my own little
9176820	9183460	fuck you of the day today. Go for it. Some fuck you of Jim Sally's land, Jesus Christ. Fuck.
9183460	9189380	Three months ago, I let my Xbox Live subscription lapse because I wasn't playing video games and I
9189380	9194660	was busy and I was moving. I just let it lapse. And I have a silver, but I don't care. I wasn't
9194660	9200580	playing anything. And today I went on there and I wanted to see if Breaking Bad was on tonight.
9201140	9205300	And I went to the stupid fucking Internet Explorer and it didn't fucking work, guys.
9206100	9211380	It said I have a fucking paid subscription if I wanted to use goddamn Internet Explorer on my
9211380	9217300	Microsoft machine. Yep, you want to use any of that premium shit. It's behind the freaking paywall.
9218340	9222420	What in the fuck is Internet Explorer Premium? It's the shittiest browser out there.
9222420	9226500	They should apologize to me when I turn it on.
9227380	9233860	If I make me pay for it. If anyone wants to go to YouTube or watch some fucking
9233860	9238420	street videos, then motherfucking YouTube doesn't work. It's okay. They make up for it by letting
9238420	9244660	you use Bing. Oh my fucking God. Bing doesn't work either. You go to Bing and you search
9244660	9248180	something and it goes, you got to pay for shit. You go and look for what's on your Xbox.
9249060	9254260	You know, that would be nice. They should allow you to set your... Maybe we should do this. Set up
9254260	9259380	some type of website on orangehondrede.com that you could set your home browser to in Internet
9259380	9263860	Explorer on Xbox. That way every time you open the browser, it would take you to a page that says,
9264420	9267860	welcome to Internet Explorer 10 on the Xbox. We're very sorry.
9271380	9275700	Where it would apologize to you every time that you do it. Welcome to Internet Explorer. We are
9275780	9279780	so sorry. We're sorry. Sorry.
9293460	9298820	Almost none of those channels, Jim Salley, will work without a gold subscription. Now,
9298820	9304180	not all, some of them will, but like this Netflix, Hulu, the stuff that people really want to work.
9304180	9310660	Nope. And this is what doesn't work. Nope. You have to have Xbox.
9314020	9321220	But it will work on the Wii, the Wii U, the PlayStation three and the PlayStation four
9321220	9327700	and your PC making my decision to buy a PlayStation three so much fucking easier.
9327700	9335300	So it is a huge wall that Microsoft might want to reconsider. The new Microsoft CEO
9335300	9340660	might want to reconsider. You know, I was considering buying an Xbox one for the
9340660	9344580	pass through because I do use the Xbox to communicate with people. But fuck,
9344580	9346740	I bet you my messenger doesn't work anymore anymore now.
9347860	9351300	Be careful. I bet you my Amazon messenger doesn't work anymore. I'm a fucking Xbox.
9351300	9355860	It's all broken. Fuck Xbox, man. Fuck Xbox, everybody. Don't buy one.
9356820	9362260	Just always put the car wash on this shit. Buy an iPad. It's fucking better.
9362260	9366420	You know, the one thing I'm kind of sad about with these new systems is that they don't have,
9367540	9373220	they only have HDMI out and they don't have options for, I understand like component and stuff,
9373220	9380180	you know, would have been nice, but like I play a lot on a PC monitor that has just a VGA in and
9380180	9383620	I'm sure there's a cable I could get, but it's going to be an elaborate setup just to play
9384260	9389860	on a VGA monitor. I really wish they'd have that so I could use a VGA cable like they had with,
9389860	9392500	you know, the Xbox 360 because I get a lot of use out of that.
9395620	9400580	So I agree. The Xbox one, whatever, everyone forget about it. Just buy a PlayStation 4.
9401780	9405780	It's not just the Xbox one. It's both PlayStation 4 too does the same thing. So it's,
9405780	9409380	I don't know, it kind of sucks because there's only really one TV I can play that on
9410100	9412980	or I'd do PC monitor, which I really don't want to.
9413940	9418500	Jim Salley, before we let you go so we can get other calls, I wanted to kind of call attention
9418500	9423380	to this real quick. You made a forum post on the VOG forums this week, kind of asking for advice
9423380	9428100	on how to kind of go about starting a podcast. And the reason why I wanted to point people to it is
9428100	9432580	because I was like, I would love it if Jim Salley did a podcast, so I want to make sure he gets the
9432580	9435860	help he needs. But then it kind of occurred to me, I was like, you know, other people might want to
9435860	9440420	read this too. So I'd really encourage, you know, if those looking for podcasting tips or whatever,
9440420	9443860	take a look on the forums. But is this something that might happen,
9443860	9446740	Jim Salley? We looking at a Jim Salley show coming soon?
9465860	9470100	A lot of us are too geeky. We don't know how to do things like drive a fucking stick.
9472500	9477140	Even my friends I know can drive, they can drive a stick in great tourism all day long.
9477140	9480580	And then they get into my little photo and they can't back it out of my driveway.
9480580	9485460	I kind of love this idea, as long as it stays on that line of being tongue in cheek and not
9485460	9488820	insulting. But I know you can do it. I know you can do it, Jim Salley. I think it would be funny.
9488820	9496820	All right, Jim Salley, I'm going to let you go so we can get more calls,
9496820	9500500	but thank you. It's always a delight to hear from you and look forward to your new show soon.
9501460	9504660	All right, everybody. Stay tuned for more. Good night, everybody.
9504660	9505620	All right. Night, Jim Salley.
9505620	9506180	Good well.
9506180	9506660	Night.
9506660	9507620	Good well, Jamie.
9508740	9510500	Do you want to send Jamie a special message?
9511540	9515220	Jamie, I want to send you a special message right now. Right now, I'm snuggling my carload.
9515220	9526260	I'm deciding it's you. I'm just squeezing the sinuses right out of your nose. Oh yeah,
9526260	9527460	Jamie. That's for you, baby.
9529460	9529780	All right.
9531940	9540020	Jim Salley, I'm going to leave you to your pillow, Jim Salley. Good night, Jim Salley. Bye.
9545620	9547300	That wasn't creepy or anything.
9550180	9554340	Jamie's in chat right now going, ew, the snot is everywhere now.
9557380	9566180	1-877-CAM-OL-R or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio if you want to give us a call.
9567300	9569860	Loki, do you have any last minute stories?
9569860	9574340	Yeah, I was going to talk about the release of a homebrew game for the Nintendo DS.
9575540	9581860	It's called Aperture Science DS, and as you might imagine, it is a DS version of Portal,
9582420	9592820	and you can download it for free on smelum.net. It's S-M-E-A-L-U-M dot net slash A-S-D-S.
9592820	9600180	Aperture Science DS. So check that out. It looks pretty impressive, actually, for a DS game.
9600180	9601060	For a homebrew.
9601060	9602900	Yeah, it's pretty impressive.
9605860	9612820	Also, the GamePop, remember them? They're one of those Android consoles that we kind of forgot
9612820	9617700	about. GamePop was the one that had the monthly service that you would subscribe to, I guess,
9619140	9624100	and they've actually announced some partnerships with different mobile game developers,
9624100	9633940	including TinyCo, who does TinyVillage, Animaka, I guess, pretty pet salon, and Creative Mobile,
9633940	9640660	which does the drag racing franchise. Also, Halfbrick, the Jetpack Joyride guys,
9641220	9646740	Vector Unit, who do Riptide GP, and Glue, Heroes of Destiny, and they're saying that they're
9646740	9654500	going to have about 500 games available when the GamePop launches in winter, and yeah.
9654500	9658900	So it's going to be, I think if I remember correctly, it's like a streaming model.
9658900	9664900	So you would be able to get a free mini model that requires a $6.99 monthly subscription,
9664900	9671460	or the more powerful model of the console, which is $129, but the subscription service is still
9671460	9678820	required. And then also GamePop games, I guess, can be played with a smartphone as well,
9680180	9684580	instead of just the controller, if you really want to. Although, why the hell would you buy
9684660	9689460	a gaming console to play on your phone when you can just play these games on your phone
9689460	9694100	to begin with? Well, sometimes with the Wii U, you're going to play on the tablet.
9694100	9699860	Remember, it's not all a card. It's $699, you get access to 500 games, so there's that too.
9701860	9706260	All right. Let me give another call for the Skype line, if you want to give us a call.
9706260	9710500	Boy, Bobby didn't get any calls tonight either. Everybody's shy tonight. 1877 GameOLR,
9710500	9714980	our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio. At least we got Jim Salley. If nothing else,
9716580	9722660	God bless Jim Salley. 1877 GameOLR, our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio. In the meantime,
9722660	9728100	I want to get to Twitter topics here. Trying to bring it up on my iPad right now,
9728100	9730820	except I had the Rocky Horror Picture show up on my iPad.
9732900	9737620	All right. Just a couple of tweets tonight from Tigerclaw. Tigerclaw sending us a couple of
9737620	9742900	tweets. One of them, a Metroid fan film Kickstarter taken down over IP dispute with
9742900	9749060	Nintendo. Does this surprise anybody? Nope. I'm surprised somebody thought they could get away
9749060	9754900	with it. Honestly. But, you know, remember we had the guy on a couple months ago who was doing the
9754900	9760180	Zelda documentary? But that was different because he was doing a documentary. There's a difference
9760180	9763860	between doing a documentary and doing a fan film. Remember, they tried to do the same thing with
9763860	9768180	Final Fantasy and that bombed. Okay. We do have another call on the line. Let's go to it. Hi,
9768180	9772900	you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this? Hey, guys. It's Degenera Johnny.
9772900	9777540	Hey, Degenera Johnny. How you doing, buddy? You know, I'm bad. Can't complain.
9778100	9784580	Good to hear from you. I want to apologize. I kind of missed most of last week's show. I was
9784580	9789700	over at Gen Con last week. That's okay. I understood you sent in an email to the
9789700	9793060	show and we somehow missed it. We didn't purposely omit it.
9793060	9798820	But I worry that we get a lot of spam at our email address and it might have been
9798820	9800580	accidentally thrown in. Oh, yeah. I understand that.
9801620	9805300	I just wanted to call people's attention to the VOG Network forums. You posted
9805300	9809140	your poem that you'd written there and it was brilliant. So, I just want to make sure people
9809140	9812420	see it. Okay. All right. I appreciate it.
9812420	9815620	No worries. So, what's up?
9815700	9821620	Okay. All right. So, I was going to let you guys know. I just came across,
9822660	9829540	during my time at Gen Con, I came across a certain game. I don't think you guys have covered it,
9831060	9835140	but I might as well just let you guys know. I played around with it
9835780	9844260	and I know we're talking about Hearthstone and all that, but this game, wow. It's a card game,
9844340	9846660	but it's an MMO card game. Really?
9846660	9851780	I don't know if you guys have heard of it. It's called Hex Shards of Fate.
9853700	9858900	The title sounds familiar, but I don't know much about it. I feel like it's one of those games.
9858900	9863220	We probably had a rapid fire news story on at one point and I didn't really look into it. So,
9863780	9867140	but you have my attention. Tell us more about it.
9868420	9871860	All right. Yeah. I know. It's like MMO card game. What the hell?
9872180	9873220	Sounds wrong.
9873220	9880580	It's being developed by Cryptozoic Games. They are the ones that, for those who listen to
9880580	9884660	Hoard House, Cryptozoic has a license for the World of Warcraft card game.
9885460	9888980	What actually, I don't know if you heard about this degenerate, Johnny,
9888980	9893140	Blizzard announced this week, I'll throw this in here as a last minute story, that the latest
9893140	9898740	expansion of the WoW trading card game is the last and that they are no longer going to be making it.
9898740	9902500	They are ending that relationship and there's no plans in the future to continue the WoW trading
9902500	9906660	card game. I don't know if that's because of Hearthstone or what, but thought I would throw
9906660	9909700	that little nugget out there just because I read that the other day. Anyway, sorry.
9910500	9915620	I heard about that actually at Gen Con. I was talking with one of the Cryptozoic guys and
9915620	9922660	they did mention that it was going to be the last expansion. The relationship has matured
9922660	9928180	with Blizzard to a degree that now they're going to develop their own type of games.
9928740	9938340	I think this Hex Shards of Fate game is actually evidence of that. I'm just wild about it.
9938900	9949220	Basically, Hex Shards of Fate, it actually had a Kickstarter earlier this summer, actually.
9952660	9956660	They just wanted a Kickstarter just to finish off the game, but they managed to get like
9956660	9962740	seven times the amount that they were asking for it, so now it's going to be able to be available
9962740	9970260	for Apple tablets and Android tablets, so lots of stuff is going on with this game.
9970980	9977460	It's actually pretty exciting. It's due to be released in some time this holiday season.
9978100	9982740	Yet another game to add to my list for the holiday season. Here's my question. What's the business
9982740	9986180	model for this game? Is it something that's free to play? Do you buy the cards? Is it
9986180	9990820	buy to play? It's free to play. Oh, nice. That's always good. It's free to play. It's actually
9990820	9996580	following probably the same type of business model as Blizzard is doing with Hearthstone, basically
9996580	10003060	two bucks a pack. However, they're also adding a freemium service, so if you want to have a
10003060	10012900	discount on your packs and gain access to tournaments free of charge, they're offering a
10013700	10021220	VIP access, which is basically four dollars a month type of thing, kind of like a subscription,
10021220	10026820	but you get a pack every week. Oh, okay. A free pack every week. It's a card of the month club.
10028020	10034100	The card of the week club. Just say cancel at any time and stuff's in either cards.
10034100	10040100	That's kind of funny. Right, exactly. All right. Yeah, so it's going to have an auction house for
10040100	10048020	you to trade your cards. Yeah, there's so much information, and I just want to let you know that
10048020	10054580	they are going to be at DragonCon, so anybody who's going to go there or you or Bobby,
10054580	10059140	you know, if anybody wants to see around, they will be at DragonCon so you can see it for yourself.
10059140	10062660	Degenera, Johnny, I thought of you recently because I know you're a big card game fan,
10062660	10066420	and a friend of mine introduced me to a card game, and I did the whole thing where I actually
10066420	10070580	went to the comic book shop and played this game with my friends. He was actually doing a lot of
10070580	10074820	demos with this game at GamerX, so I want to give a shout out to this game because it was a lot of
10074820	10079620	fun. Totally not the game you called in to talk about tonight, but I hijacked your call, I'm sorry,
10079620	10083540	but the game is called Sentinels of the Multiverse. Have you played this?
10085540	10094900	I've seen it being played not in my local card store, but I was seen it being played
10094900	10100500	at GenCon though. Yeah, that's a fun game. It's a co-op card game. You don't play against each
10100500	10105700	other. It's either you all win or nobody wins. I thought that was a really neat kind of catch
10105700	10113460	to the game, so. Sounds very familiar. It sounds kind of similar to Lord of the Rings because Lord
10113460	10121380	of the Rings is a game where you basically go up against a deck that is not you, but it is not
10121380	10128740	another player. It's just you taking on scenarios, and you can do it in co-op, so it can be
10129380	10136820	your own fellowship. So that's very interesting, and I've seen that. It's pretty interesting that
10136820	10144180	card games are now making the rise of basically you don't have to find someone to play with. You
10144180	10150340	can play it with yourself, or instead of going up against each other, you can just co-op into it. So
10150740	10158260	it's just a new inventive way of card gaming, which I'm actually very excited for. So what's
10158260	10163540	the name of the game again? Sentinels of the Multiverse, and we actually might get the guy
10163540	10168340	on one of the shows later on, or one of the developers of the game, because I don't think
10168340	10172180	it would be a good fit for OLR, but I'm going to see if some of the other VoG shows are interested
10172180	10176660	in it. So if not, we'll do something. We'll do a Google Hangout or something, so. But yeah.
10176900	10181780	Anyway, Degenerate Johnny, I should probably let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thanks for
10181780	10186740	your call. Always a pleasure to hear from you. Yeah, my pleasure. Take care. You guys take care.
10186740	10191860	All right. Bye-bye. There goes Degenerate Johnny adding yet another game to my queue to play this
10191860	10197540	holiday season. I actually should be cussing him out and not thanking him. All right. Anyhow,
10200340	10203860	a couple other tweets here from some listeners. If you do want to give us a call, we can try to
10203860	10208740	squeeze in one more call. 1877 Game OLR or username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio.
10208740	10213940	Tigerclaw sends us a tweet. Blizzard on World of Warcraft. We'd be lost without casuals. Oh,
10213940	10218820	before I get to that, I should, Tigerclaw sent in that tweet on Metroid fan film.
10218820	10222820	He wanted to clarify and make sure we report on the fact that the fan film was only going to be
10222820	10230100	10 minutes and non-for-profit, but they were asking for $90,000 to fund it. 10 minutes? Come on.
10230180	10234500	Maybe they were going to actually film in space. I don't know. No, I didn't read up on it. I'm not
10234500	10238580	going to. It's a little. All right. Look, we got another call coming in, so let's go to it. Hi,
10238580	10243380	you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this? Hi, this is Ragenator. Hey, Ragenator. How you doing?
10244420	10251780	Okay, I guess. It's a webcam call. Good to see you. Nice to see you too. Just a quick story,
10251780	10258580	last story. I don't think it's been mentioned either last week or the week before. Although
10258580	10264180	you did mention some news that was kind of sort of related. I think it was last week and the
10264180	10270660	week before you mentioned that Microsoft is getting rid of the Microsoft coins and they also,
10270660	10278660	in turn, they're getting rid of the gains for Windows Marketplace. One thing that was not
10278660	10292340	mentioned is that they're getting rid of the Zoom Marketplace. In fact, I found this out through
10294180	10302260	email that Microsoft sent out to me not too long ago. The way it's been explained to me,
10302260	10310180	the reason why they're getting rid of the Zoom Marketplace is because apparently the Zoom
10310180	10318900	Marketplace is set up in such a way that it will only recognize Microsoft coins as a method of
10318900	10327940	payment. It won't recognize dollars and cents or pesos or euros or whatever your local currency
10327940	10338980	happens to be. Right. Now, the catch point too is if you have an Xbox 360, you'll still be able to
10340740	10346740	use the equivalent to... But with the old tech, you're screwed, basically.
10347460	10353860	Yeah. I think this is why Raginator, knowing a company's exit strategy for the inevitable
10353860	10358500	day that they close their doors and the day and age of digital distribution is so important.
10358500	10361940	And I think that's one reason everybody kind of goes to Steam a little bit because Steam has
10361940	10366660	made it very clear, should we ever close our doors, we have the magic button that we can
10366660	10370740	press that will make all the games DRM-free and you won't have to connect to the servers anymore.
10370740	10376660	But when we talk about movies and music and so forth, that really sucks if you were one of those
10376660	10381540	people who actually invested in a Zoom and it's like, okay, you'll have those movies, but you
10382180	10386580	can't really use the Zoom now for anything else. Or like my HD DVD player.
10387700	10395540	Yeah. The weird thing is, at least with me, ever since Sony burned me a handful of times,
10397300	10402180	when I still have my PlayStation 3, I had to send my system in to get repaired. They have
10402180	10409700	my videos reactivated. I slowly but surely made my way over to the Zoom service and been getting
10410660	10417940	TV shows and movies and this and that. The vast majority of stuff were the previews,
10417940	10426900	but I do have my fair share of the paid content. In fact, case in point, I've just been going to
10426900	10439460	a neck case and video game music soundtrack kick. Whenever I begin to spare money here and there,
10439460	10449700	I've been finding stuff up left and right. I've been using the service for my PC because I don't
10449700	10459620	have iTunes. I already happen to have an Xbox account set up for when I still have the 360,
10459620	10464420	so no need for extra passwords to remember, so on and so forth.
10465220	10474420	Well, Ragenator, this is kind of a crap situation, but unfortunately, this is the downside to tech,
10474420	10479220	and especially when our tech advances so fast. I think tough lesson learned,
10479220	10482900	always take a look at that user license agreement even though you're not going to sit there and read
10482900	10489460	all 27 pages or 99 pages or however long it is. Look for that part that talks about who really
10489460	10493860	owns the stuff that you're buying and what's going to happen. Anyway, Ragenator, we're going
10493860	10497300	to wrap up so we can wrap up the show, but any quick other thoughts you want to get out before
10497300	10503380	we let you go? No, there'll be. I just want to really mention the closing of that particular
10503380	10507860	service since it really wasn't mentioned before. All right. All right. Well, take care, buddy.
10507860	10513300	Thanks for the call. All right. Have a good one. All right. You too. Bye-bye. All right. I think
10513300	10516820	that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight. I'm going to close it on up. Sorry to those that
10516820	10520820	didn't get through, although it wasn't exactly ringing off the hook tonight, but if you have
10520820	10527220	any other thoughts you want to get through, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com. Sorry, did I
10527220	10533780	already check? Do we have anything else? No, that's it. No more last minute stories. All right. Let
10533860	10541860	me see. I think I had one other tweet here that I wanted to do. Oh, thegarthwolf sent us a tweet
10541860	10548980	that says, I totally got into the 14 coral server tonight. Got to play the intro quest and now
10548980	10553860	maintenance just started. Just my luck. Well, we were talking a little bit about the Final Fantasy
10553860	10559860	14, kind of the bumpy launch there they've been having. Let's just hope in a week it's all a
10559860	10565380	distant memory. Oh, I want to make sure I got this one in. Grandpa from Hoard House sent this
10565380	10572500	tweet. I almost forgot it because he sent it earlier in the day. Oh, it's a video. Okay,
10572500	10576740	long story short, it's another one of those fricking sensationalistic CNN things where an
10576740	10581860	eight-year-old shot his 90-year-old caretaker and it was because of a violent video game. And I
10581860	10585940	think, don't quote me on this, but I think this is the one that Piers Morgan on his Twitter
10586580	10590820	wrote out there and said, don't tell me after hearing things like this, that violent video
10590820	10594420	games don't cause violent behavior and dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, blah, blah, blah.
10594420	10602660	So here we go again with the media, you know, well, and this is a nightmare that an eight-year-old
10602660	10609220	boy would shoot his 90-year-old caretaker, but who was letting an eight-year-old game play violent
10609220	10617220	video games unsupervised. I'm not blaming the 90-year-old, I'm blaming the parents. Where did
10617220	10622660	he get the violent video game? Why was he playing the violent video game? Why aren't you asking
10622660	10628900	these questions, Piers Morgan? Where's the fucking responsibility? Blah, blah, blah. Okay,
10628900	10633940	Black Wolf is actually clarifying that Piers tweet was about a different interview with a guy who
10633940	10638980	shot both his parents at 19. Fine. I stand corrected, but my point doesn't change.
10641060	10650820	All right. That's it. I think we're done. It's been a crazy show tonight, but we're on out of
10650820	10656100	here for the next two weeks. Thank you guys as always for listening to our show. Thanks for your
10656100	10660100	download. Thanks for your support. We always appreciate you supporting independent radio.
10660900	10664420	Hopefully you liked what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio, but if you didn't,
10664420	10668340	just be sure to support other independent broadcasters. There's many people out there
10668340	10673780	working very hard to put these types of shows together, and we all appreciate your support
10673780	10679220	so much. I'm not going to ask you for your money or a financial donation, but I will ask if you
10679220	10684340	like what you heard, spread the word. Tell a friend or two about the show. Post a nice
10684340	10688820	five-star review on iTunes or give us a thumbs up in Stitcher or whatever. Help us spread the
10688820	10693220	word about the show because that is all the marketing that we can afford is word of mouth.
10694660	10699860	Loki, any last minute thoughts tonight? I'm going to just try to finish up Saints Row 4
10699860	10704980	this week, maybe even tonight because I'm almost 100%. So I can probably do it.
10704980	10709700	You can do it. My final thought is I hope I get to play at least another hour of Final Fantasy
10709700	10715860	XIV tonight, but we'll see if that stupid maintenance finishes right at the time I
10715860	10721060	get home from picking up Alan. That would be fantastic. Fantastic timing. All right.
10721060	10725220	Well, that does it for another week here at Orange Launch Radio. We will be back in two weeks. Have
10725220	10729060	a great Labor Day. Those of you guys here in the States, for those of you in other countries,
10729060	10734900	have a great week. Enjoy your time and have fun playing the various online games that are
10734900	10740020	launching over the next two weeks. We will be back for another show live Monday, excuse me,
10740020	10744660	Sunday, September 8th. So we'll see you then with another episode of Orange Launch Radio.
10744660	10747860	Have a great night. You've been listening to Orange
10747860	10756580	Lounge Radio. Orange Lounge Radio is a production of OLR Studios. To join us for a live show,
