13930	25056	Tonight, August 25th, 2013, the PlayStation 4's launch is detailed, League of Legends experiences a security breach, and you can soon return digital copies of games in one online store.
31431	36832	Hello, my friends out there on the Internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
36972	43034	It is Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 517 for this August the 25th of 2013.
44914	54716	Pull up a chair in our live chat room, live.vognetwork.com, where you can participate with the program as we talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
54776	58017	My name's Rob Roberts, here with you as always every week.
58357	61398	My co-hosts, say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
61738	61958	Hi.
62158	62739	Hi, how are you?
63139	63519	Sniffy.
63619	65860	Yeah, you sound like you are having heck of allergies today.
66460	67140	Or something.
67320	73483	I just, this morning I woke up and was really congested and it's all sinus too because it's all just in my nose.
73763	79605	I know the city where we're based, Sacramento, California, is not a very pleasant one for allergy sufferers.
80505	82406	But I always thought that was more of a spring thing.
82486	84607	So you can get it pretty bad this time of year too.
85226	86927	I don't even know what set it off, really.
87027	88768	I mean, it may have been left over from the fires.
88848	90669	It could have been... I don't know.
92030	93110	Oh, yeah, those fires.
93150	100334	There's these horrible fires burning outside of Yosemite, this big national park that's... Now, it's really far.
100374	103396	Well, you know, it's probably, what, like a five, six-hour drive from here?
103416	104877	Also, it caused a minor heat wave for us.
104917	107898	But, oh, yeah, I mean, it's really burning out of control.
107938	112341	So I don't think I know anybody in the OLR listening base that lives in that area, but if you do...
113101	119965	I really hope you're safe and taking care of yourself, you know, and my thoughts go out to you guys, because pretty terrible, that fire out there.
120366	126410	I've had Benadryl and Sudafed, and I even laid down, well, it just doesn't seem to be doing much good.
128071	129251	Well, I hope you feel better.
129271	130232	I'm not sick.
130312	131853	Despite all the fires and all that.
132093	133074	I feel awful, though.
133614	134575	Well, feel better.
134815	137396	If you need more coffee, because coffee helps.
138117	139658	I'm full of Ricolas now.
139929	147315	Well, speaking of our hometown of Sacramento, I wanted to mention this real quick with you and we referenced this on Bobby Blackwolf's show just before we went live tonight.
147695	156643	But here in Sacramento, California, you know, once in a while we get celebrities because they come up here from Hollywood to lobby for different bills and so forth.
157143	158284	Or in this case, come from England.
158524	161787	Yes, or we used to have a governor, but I won't go there.
161887	162648	Y'all know about that.
163148	165750	But in this case... That's actually happened twice.
166271	166771	That's true.
166951	167312	That's true.
167332	168112	Because there was Reagan.
168132	169434	Yeah, he was a famous movie actor too.
170835	172676	But anyway, past all the politics stuff.
174398	176420	Democrat, Republican, and everything in between.
176940	177821	It doesn't matter who you are.
177881	179082	You love John Barrowman.
179202	179562	Oh, yes.
179963	180863	If you know who he is.
181464	182565	We'll get to that in a minute.
182945	185027	Because Tech Master Loki had no idea who he was.
185327	188129	But he's from Doctor Who and Torchwood.
188810	193294	And he was one of the people in the new producers.
193434	199779	He also was on a couple of series in England where it was like one of them was How Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria?
199959	200379	Oh, yeah, yeah.
200399	202521	Where they cast for West End plays.
202541	203722	He did stage stuff and all that.
203802	205764	It's basically like American Idol for stage theater.
206284	215352	and he's just, no matter your sexuality or who you are, like you have to admit, he is a very gorgeous, handsome man.
216192	219355	So a lot of people like him for that reason alone.
219535	221957	But he's here in Sacramento and we can't figure out why.
222698	225080	There's a big nerd convention coming up next weekend.
225340	226301	Can't he just be in town?
226841	231743	I guess, but I'm kind of like, well, why would he... Well, and I'm even thinking about the little bit I know about him.
231783	232663	His family's in Florida.
232683	233003	Yeah.
233103	235604	And the rest of his... And he lives in England.
235904	236284	Who knows?
236644	239205	Maybe he came to San Francisco and thought he'd swing by.
239685	240666	But here's my hope.
240686	247588	Since he's supposed to be at DragonCon in a few days, as am I, I got my fingers and my toes crossed that we might be on the same flight.
249309	255693	I don't pray very often, but if anybody up there is listening, I want to be on the same flight as John Barrowman to Atlanta.
256233	257954	Five and a half hours on a plane with John Barrowman.
257974	259315	Yes, please!
259495	260095	Are you flying?
260756	261116	Delta.
262837	265219	It's the only one that had a direct flight to Atlanta.
265239	266239	It might have a first class.
266319	267800	Yeah, I think they do.
267820	269121	I wonder if his husband came along.
270354	270714	I think so.
270734	271415	I think he was in the pictures.
271435	271835	All right, anyway.
272496	274818	Listeners are here to... They're entirely too cute together.
274938	281424	They're here to hear about video games, not to hear about John Barrowman, although quite frankly, who's going to complain?
281784	284146	Maybe Tech Master Loki will complain.
284186	285567	Hey, Tech Master Loki, how you doing?
285747	286348	Doing good.
286488	286748	Yeah?
287569	289671	John Barrowman, Adam's Ass in a Photo Op
313288	317401	and I bet Adam didn't wash that ass for an entire week.
317481	318786	Or at least the jeans attached to the ass.
318806	320090	At least the jeans attached to them.
322763	325905	Techinus in chat suggesting I make friends with a stewardess.
326605	327586	I may have to.
327606	329047	They're called flight attendants now.
330567	333369	Alan Alchemy says, Rob, you aren't in first class though.
333749	337171	That doesn't mean I won't still find a way to run into him.
337711	339312	Don't question my powers.
340613	340913	All right.
342073	342354	Anyhow.
343634	344515	Loki, how have you been?
344555	345136	What's new with you?
347598	348359	Not a whole ton.
348779	355845	So I thought of you earlier today because apparently all this Grand Theft Auto 5 information is leaking to the internet.
356326	365394	And at first I thought, oh my gosh, there's a pirated version of the game out there already and those poor guys are going to lose those sales because it's already out there on the internet when we're weeks away from launch.
366355	368297	But that's not totally the case, right, Loki?
368337	369798	What's going on in the Grand Theft Auto world?
370218	375901	The European region had the digital version of it that people had pre-ordered.
376482	378683	It became live for a little bit.
379483	382185	Not necessarily live, but you can pre-load it.
382265	386207	People were downloading the 18GB file to their PS3.
386347	392791	Of course, they would dump it and try to hack it to get it to run and stuff.
392811	392951	But
393291	393792	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
410290	416355	Basically, he says there's no way to open up the archives yet because they don't have the keys to do that.
416915	420078	And I don't think that the executable is included with that.
420118	421599	I think that's what comes in the patch.
421699	422760	So even if you could...
424082	426444	WhatUpG in our chatroom says the soundtrack leaked.
442903	451751	Yeah, so the soundtrack's leaked, and a lot of the spoilers from the game have leaked as well because they have all the cutscene audio, so people are documenting it.
451771	454413	I've been pretty good in trying to stay away from all that stuff.
454473	465303	I did read one thing, but I kind of figured some of the people from the other games would be coming back in the game, like a cameo or something like that, so it's not a huge deal.
465783	469026	But I'm trying not to read any spoilers in the game.
469046	469106	Wow.
469206	469746	Thanks for watching!
483266	487909	If there was a working version out there that leaked to the internet, that's a whole other story.
488630	491732	That's not necessarily spoiling, you're playing through the game.
491752	492372	Illegally.
493053	498376	I intend on purchasing on both platforms, so I don't care.
498757	499797	I know you, Loki.
500158	507002	If it did leak, you would be downloading it and playing it, and yes, you'd be one of those bad people, but you would still be buying two copies of it.
507202	507663	Absolutely.
508203	536897	that's why I'm not giving you a worse time about it yeah I'm still you know I'm buying it on both platforms just so I can play with my friends because I don't know what platform they're going to play on you know I still want to play on 360 because I like the controller better but you know my boss plays on PS3 and he's trying to get other people to buy the PS3 version as well I guess there's one of my co-workers in Dallas he's buying both versions as well so I still want to play on 360 but I think a lot of people are playing on PS3 as well so I'll just have to play both
538198	542702	and WhatUpG in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com also says, I am not here to spoil things.
542762	544543	If people want spoilers, they can look for them.
544583	547025	And I think that's the nice thing to do, so please, chatters.
547806	553911	Y'all are very well behaved, but please do not spoil Grand Theft Auto V. If you want to look up spoilers, it's on gtaforums.com.
553931	560016	They have a whole section of their forum dedicated to Grand Theft Auto V spoilers if you really want to look at it, but...
560917	561778	Thank you for watching!
576912	577613	I'm fine with that.
577713	579074	I'll look at the track list.
579094	580235	That's not spoiling anything for me.
580255	582317	That's not a big deal.
582357	585279	I'm not going to look up any of the cutscene audio stuff.
585319	587421	I'm not going to listen to any of that.
588782	592986	We're just too close to coming out to spoil myself on some of the stuff in the game.
593566	593907	Good for you.
594407	596648	You know, like Easter eggs and stuff, that's a whole different thing.
596949	598770	I'll look that stuff up because it's fun.
598830	599851	All right.
599931	603393	Well, I know you are very much looking forward to Grand Theft Auto V. What's the big day again?
603433	604394	We're about three weeks out.
604734	604814	17th.
604854	605615	Four weeks out.
605675	607636	17th, but I'm hoping to get that Friday before.
608877	610998	Using your connections.
611038	611439	I need it.
612720	617963	We'll get into what we've been playing this week, but I do have a few other topics I want to address here at the top of the show.
618083	620825	First off, I do want to say a big hello and hi.
620845	620885	It
621886	622146	DragonCon
649045	649685	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
669013	669614	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
688911	695716	I've met a variety of listeners at PAX East and E3 and PAX Prime and whatever other conventions I've been at, ASEN, so forth.
695776	698178	So I would love to meet more at DragonCon.
698878	700539	You get three opportunities now.
701280	705763	The folks at DragonCon have been wonderful in just kind of helping us get involved.
706443	716550	So Saturday night, 5.30 at the Hilton 203, the VOG Super Show, where several of us from VOG are going to get together to talk about the story about VOG Network and
716870	722515	and talk about what it's like to have been podcasting for so long and where we see our future is going and maybe
723271	724972	We have a surprise announcement in store.
725212	728214	We'll be recording that, because that would be kind of cool to record that.
728394	731857	We will be recording that, and Bobby will be putting it on his feed later on.
732177	734058	So that will be awesome.
734278	736720	Yes, Bobby Blackwolf says, hello to people in the future.
737020	741423	That is literally what I'm doing right now, saying hello to the future people, the tomorrow people.
741543	752631	Of course, you know, I'd have to give you my little contribution on the whole thing, and that would be sitting in the middle of my classroom, in my portfolio class, using that time to work on Logo.
754132	758017	and my teacher being perfectly fine with it because it was all stuff that was going to go in my portfolio.
758577	760019	You know what I'll do for you, DarkSakura?
760059	762462	Is that the panel to kind of make it like you were there?
762782	767628	Just every 30 seconds or so, I'll just go... No.
769110	769630	I'm just kidding.
769650	770351	Don't sound like that.
771532	772513	I'm just being a jerk.
772653	772913	All right.
773293	775095	No, you're being a bitch.
775995	778137	In all seriousness, giving Jamie a hard time.
778917	782660	In all seriousness, though, on Sunday, we're going to be a part of the Parsec Awards.
783140	786322	We have been honored to be asked to be a part of that.
786662	793147	So it's going to be like, I don't know, it's going to be like I'm on stage at the Oscars giving an award, although it's on a much different scale.
793167	793707	Wear a swan dress.
795408	796209	That's what you should do.
796229	798691	You need to wear a swan dress with an egg.
799011	802434	I would sit on Travis's lap and lay an egg.
802715	803695	No, you know what we need to do?
804056	804256	What?
804316	811002	We need to go to an airbrush place that does t-shirts and have them make you a swan.
811222	812103	Okay, you've got 48 hours.
813664	814144	You know what?
814324	816585	I've had one done in an hour, so you can get a swan.
816625	817245	I'll draw you a swan.
817265	819085	That would be awesome, a swan dress t-shirt.
820265	821166	That could be pretty sweet.
821186	821966	That could be pretty sweet.
822426	823306	You can be Bjork.
823666	824466	So that will be that.
824506	826907	We are presenting one of the awards towards the end of the ceremony.
827287	833708	And then on Monday, there's a panel about live streaming and about doing live streams and so forth.
834068	835069	Bobby's on the panel.
835149	836209	I'm just going to support.
836529	842010	And as somebody who does a lot of live streaming himself through this show, through game streaming and so forth...
842590	843491	And that'll be a good time.
843511	847954	So that's Monday at 11, 1130 in the morning.
847994	848694	Just look for the streaming.
848714	849555	At something in the morning.
849895	850856	At something in the morning.
850916	852237	And let's just put it this way.
852257	859141	It'll be a miracle that I'm awake because I'll probably still be on the West Coast clock and on convention sleep.
859281	860482	It'll be a miracle that I'm awake.
860582	861423	Oh, boo-hoo.
861523	861903	I know, right?
861923	863104	Eight o'clock in the morning.
863584	868705	On convention time though, oh my gosh.
869405	872386	I've already been told about all the drinks I'm going to be made to consume.
872446	874367	Let's hope I don't end up in the hospital for heaven's sake.
874427	880408	If I could make it to a morning where I actually woke up as late as 8 o'clock, that would be a miracle.
880528	892471	I know I might sound peppy today because there's a lot of things to be excited about, but last night, thanks to traffic, we went to San Francisco last night and didn't get back home because of traffic until 3 in the morning.
893371	894652	and... Baseball game or something?
895192	899333	No, there was construction on Highway 80 where they were reducing it down to one lane.
899413	900274	Are they repaving lanes?
900434	904415	Every asshole has to speed up as far as they can to the last minute to merge in.
904455	907376	Well, they were also putting up warnings that the Bay Bridge was going to be closed during the next week.
907636	908817	That's not even it, though.
908837	909317	So what is it?
909437	916479	Is this like national or, I don't know, like California State, you know, Repave Your Street Month or something?
916519	919440	Because everybody is repaving the goddamn street.
920021	920481	Everybody.
920801	920941	Like,
921201	924142	Everybody is doing it all like the last couple weeks.
925743	927503	Yeah, there's a lot of construction stuff.
927543	929304	Anyway, listeners don't care about that.
929984	931044	But DragonCon, yes.
931084	933185	So things going on Saturday, Sunday, Monday.
933425	937527	If you want to follow me on Twitter, I'll post updates about where I'm at provided my phone has a charge.
937867	940287	Twitter.com slash Sky, S-K-I-E.
940327	941348	That's my personal Twitter.
941908	944469	So you can follow me there and get your DragonCon updates.
945509	950613	DarkSakura, Loki, sadly not coming with me to DragonCon, but I know we'll be following the news from PAX at home.
950793	951673	I'm going to SchoolCon.
951934	952174	Are you?
952194	952694	Yeah.
952714	953214	Well, that's good.
953855	956116	I'm actually dropping a class and taking another class.
956156	958298	I'm surprised you're not going to go to SacAnime at least for a day.
958358	958998	Just check it out.
959218	960920	Rob, SacAnime costs money.
961460	962300	Guess who doesn't have a job?
962381	962721	That's true.
962761	964322	You can't pull media strings.
965573	967574	It was actually, I tried, it's too late.
967855	968075	Don't.
968375	971077	But I'm trying to get us in for a panel next con.
971317	972017	Yes, yes please.
972037	976000	I would totally Skype in, I know how con wifi is.
976040	977881	Yeah, con wifi is a pain in the ass.
977901	980283	We'd love to have you, but that's why we're not live streaming.
980523	985066	If you want to know why we aren't live streaming the panel, especially when we have big news to talk about, that's why.
985166	986887	Because you cannot depend on hotel wifi.
987308	990290	Even though I'm sure they bring in the Uber stuff for DragonCon, which is a huge deal.
991190	992091	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1011750	1018912	A lot of problems going on with Final Fantasy XIV's launch, which is really unfortunate, but they're having some severe network issues.
1019372	1035656	Once you get in the game, it's a fairly pleasant experience, except for the fact that the first day, instances weren't working, which usually in most MMOs isn't a big deal, except in Final Fantasy XIV, you have story instances you have to do about every five levels, and you go into solo instances and beat them.
1035916	1046507	Which is fun, and it helps you learn about your character and so forth, but when the instance finder's down, that really sucks, because you can't progress your character past level 10, unless you had a character who was already higher level.
1046847	1050091	And don't forget about the fates lasting four times as long as normal.
1050191	1051712	Yeah, so it's just a mess.
1051732	1053214	Which wasn't bad, it was a lot of experience.
1053414	1054255	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1078291	1078732	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1093530	1100393	It really sucks that these network issues are taking away that attention from what is otherwise a great game.
1100413	1108275	And it really sucks that Square Enix wasn't a little better prepared for it, which every MMO has the same damn story.
1108575	1109156	Exactly.
1109296	1113937	Every MMO has the same exact story when it comes to launching and servers being offline stuff.
1113977	1117499	So why did Microsoft think that they're going to be different?
1118499	1122303	with their whole online tie to, you know, consoles and stuff.
1122503	1123103	Oh, no, no.
1123424	1125425	Everybody's going to screw that up, but we won't.
1125706	1126626	We won't screw it up.
1126646	1127207	Microsoft?
1127848	1135795	Well, yeah, because he's saying with the Xbox One, you know, and we were saying at the time, we said, look at what happened to Diablo 3, look at what happened to SimCity.
1135955	1139038	Well, just add Final Fantasy 14 to that list.
1139138	1143281	SimCity, perfect example of like, well, we saw what happened with Diablo 3 and
1144102	1146043	We're taking precautions to make sure that doesn't happen.
1146543	1148964	And it's like, you just cursed yourself, you stupid idiot.
1149964	1153225	No matter who you are, these situations are going to keep happening.
1153545	1163608	I mean, the first Final Fantasy XIV version 1.0 was such a stinker that they probably were legitimately not expecting this many people from North America to give it a second chance.
1164008	1168430	I think it's amazing and speaks to the quality of the game that people are giving it a second chance.
1169290	1171152	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1189025	1212885	so he's you know he's a great guy and you know is is also a nerd as well as doing sports ball for a living and sticks up for all this stuff well he was writing these tweets this weekend very angry and he was so mad he couldn't even redeem his code for Final Fantasy 14 that he did a charge back on buying the game you know which wow yeah I know it's kind of a dick thing to do but I get it but there's probably a lot of people out there that are feeling kind of ripped off and it kind of
1213405	1215848	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1233246	1233947	How do we get around that?
1233987	1238670	That's the thing is, that's why Microsoft's pushing the whole Azure server thing.
1239071	1243795	It's basically virtual servers, so they can scale them back pretty fast.
1244935	1251981	Virtual servers, so basically they can scale them back pretty fast when it does die off instead of having all this hardware that they're running.
1252001	1255904	They're running a bunch of virtual machines, and so there's that.
1256545	1260488	So maybe something like that would help, and then that way...
1262029	1274813	It's a hard balancing game because you don't want to buy too many servers or have too many of them running because you're not going to need them past launch once that kind of evens out.
1275253	1285015	So you deal with spending less money up front and having people kind of be a little bit pissed about it for two weeks and then leveling off and everybody kind of forgetting about it.
1286856	1291137	Or you spend a lot of money and have everybody be happy but you're out all that extra money up
1291577	1292117	and DarkSakura.com.
1321615	1350659	I think what has to happen is that a lot of MMOs at this point really need to kind of challenge themselves on the multiple server way of thinking that a lot of MMOs do and I see some MMOs and I think Guild Wars and I'm even thinking back to the original Guild Wars is a great example of this kind of has the and you see Warcraft moving towards this too with their whole servers that they're talking about the virtual servers where we need to really like you might be on a different box you might be playing on a different machine but
1350839	1374327	but it's one world it's one world and you are phased to the people that you want to play with and so forth like Guild Wars did this you go into the city and you could pick which one of the 50 different copies of the city do you want to be in and then when you go out in the world you're in your own little instance and I think that was a good way to kind of challenge the traditional you're on your server and you don't leave those servers and if you want to change servers 25 bucks kind of way of thinking
1374887	1380492	Well, that's just dumb anyways because copying a file across the server Well, that's World of Warcraft.
1380532	1381913	That's World of Warcraft right now.
1382574	1385596	It's like charging you $75 to put a cabin air filter in.
1385917	1387038	It takes like one second.
1387078	1391842	See, I hated the cross-server instances as well, which is one of the big reasons I quit.
1392583	1393043	Hated it.
1393724	1397907	I would rather be on one server with the people who I know are on one server.
1399108	1401991	But what if you have that one friend who's on another server?
1402051	1404094	I mean, the way WoW does it, I like that.
1404114	1404674	It was funny for Drew.
1404774	1407377	I hated when you're out in the world and it crossed server.
1408378	1408999	Yeah.
1409019	1410140	I loathed it.
1410280	1412022	Yeah, that screwed up the crafting.
1412162	1414144	But anyway, I don't... It screwed up everything.
1414404	1418989	I don't want to get too much into the WoW talk because, you know, I already have another show for a lot of that.
1419029	1420551	But I think this MMO stuff is good.
1420811	1423732	If I wanted to play cross-server, it was with someone I knew.
1423832	1426493	I could choose to play with somebody I wanted to play with.
1426773	1432875	They just need to put out the server program or whatever for Final Fantasy XI.
1432915	1433675	Just let it go.
1434356	1436857	You are dying to hack the crap out of that game.
1436877	1438357	I just want to play that game.
1438377	1440558	Free-to-play would have been awesome for that.
1441098	1443279	It's got to go free-to-play or close pretty soon.
1444119	1444559	We'll see.
1445680	1447322	They just released an expansion.
1447382	1450765	The very last PlayStation 2 game ever made was a Final Fantasy XI expansion.
1451305	1456350	They have to... They don't have to do anything.
1456370	1458352	They don't have to do shit.
1458452	1459653	They don't have to do a damn thing.
1460894	1462775	They have to die and pay taxes.
1462875	1463296	That's it.
1465029	1465429	Anyhow.
1465789	1469211	Even then, you know, corporations get out of the taxes.
1470032	1470332	All right.
1471652	1477635	Let's get into how was your gamey week and specifically what types of games have you been playing this week besides XIV and all that?
1477675	1478736	What other games have you been playing?
1478756	1479336	DarkSakura.
1479997	1485479	Fractal, Dragon Age 2, Mass Effect 3, and Animal Crossing.
1486000	1488241	Is there something going on with a Dragon Age renaissance?
1488261	1490542	Because Alan's been really into Dragon Age this week, too.
1491118	1491378	Dragon Age 2
1506580	1510461	And, um, yeah, I wasn't super impressed with it.
1510501	1511081	It was okay.
1511121	1516243	I might go back and play Origins and Awakenings, but I just wanted to finish it.
1516283	1520064	That, and you know, while there was server maintenance going on, I was like, okay, I'll just play something else.
1520524	1521484	I really didn't care.
1521624	1522905	I haven't had the energy to care.
1523805	1527306	So, it's like, when one thing goes down, well, it's not like I don't have 50,000 other things to play.
1527546	1529927	And that's the way a lot of people should look at it.
1530407	1539971	And not to dig up the old topic we just left, but I will say, like most things in gaming, a month from now, who's going to remember all this fuckery?
1540832	1541832	Very few people.
1542172	1545514	Well, we'll still remember it, but we won't be angry about it.
1545534	1547554	You'll be past it, because you'll all be busy playing the game.
1547755	1550056	Like, remember when PlayStation 3 was hacked?
1550876	1555698	Remember when Xbox 360 took all those people's money through the EA games?
1556278	1561705	Remember all these things that happened that we just kind of... Remember when they... You know, just Red Ring.
1561725	1562306	Yeah.
1563936	1566138	Remember when Diablo 3 launched and it was shit?
1566638	1567119	Hey!
1567459	1571222	Speaking of which, Diablo 3 launches in a couple weeks.
1571403	1572223	How do you think that's going to do?
1572243	1573324	I don't think it's going to do very well.
1573464	1574906	It doesn't seem pretty popular so far.
1575166	1577248	There's not a whole ton coming out in September, remember?
1577308	1582332	There's Grand Theft Auto, and then FIFA, and Diablo.
1583153	1583853	That's pretty much it.
1585255	1586035	Rayman, I guess.
1586316	1590239	I think it's probably going to be the second biggest game of the month.
1592361	1594122	Jamie, was there anything else you wanted to say about your gaming week?
1595163	1595603	Not really.
1595943	1598805	Sorry, I didn't mean to deviate from it too much, but you were having a sneezy.
1598905	1602227	No, actually, I think something might have set off my allergies worse.
1602927	1603868	I hope it wasn't the kitty.
1604088	1604849	I don't think it's the kitty.
1605369	1606249	Can't be anything in here.
1607050	1609171	Was it the stuff I used to vacuum earlier, maybe?
1609271	1609651	I don't think so.
1609691	1612453	I don't know, but it's now getting into my eyes.
1612673	1613433	Ooh, I feel better.
1613894	1615975	If you need to go outside for a minute or something, do it.
1616275	1617680	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1623092	1629096	I'm going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com FifthDream says, I want the Diablo 3 expansion a lot.
1629116	1630397	We'll be talking about that in a little bit.
1630757	1633299	DungeonBuster says, the trailer for that looks nice.
1634059	1638082	Codeman says, never forget Final Fantasy XIV, A Realm Reborn.
1638382	1641544	Well, honestly, Codeman, you could probably insert any other MMO in there.
1641885	1642685	Every MMO.
1642845	1643646	Every single one of them.
1643666	1645007	Never forget Ragnarok Online.
1645087	1647989	And Square Enix would probably want you to forget about Final Fantasy XIV.
1648089	1649090	Take one.
1649210	1649870	Exactly.
1650310	1650971	Exactly.
1651431	1656638	The smoothest MMO launch I probably played was probably actually Guild Wars 2.
1657399	1658200	I will give them credit.
1658480	1660302	That was a pretty smooth launch.
1660583	1662185	But it still had its share of problems.
1662505	1665308	Defiance wasn't so bad, but that's also because no one was playing it.
1667371	1668913	Alright, Loki, how was your gaming week?
1669586	1671728	I only played Saints Row 4 this week.
1672708	1680273	I actually started off playing the Xbox 360 version, but then once my Steam version unlocked, I just went ahead and finished up and played on that.
1680413	1683355	And I'm pretty much... I'm almost 100% complete.
1684576	1690060	I have just one mission left, so I've been finishing up all the activities, and I'm almost gold in everything.
1690320	1693962	I have all the collectibles collected, and I have...
1695203	1696423	Almost all the activity is done.
1696644	1701425	I have a few more that have the gold that I had silver on, but I'll probably be done with it today.
1703246	1705967	Which brings me to more about the game.
1706427	1709268	A little pseudo-review, if you will.
1710822	1711723	Thanks for watching!
1730686	1744293	and then as you get to the point where you're finding more of your crew members, you're taking them out of the simulation and you're starting to do the loyalty missions and stuff, it's where they start actually getting pretty creative with the actual missions and stuff.
1744313	1745694	And there's some pretty funny stuff in there.
1746234	1751937	There is one with Asha where it's a whole rip on Metal Gear Solid.
1752377	1753057	And so there's...
1755779	1760683	The whole point in there is like, okay, in this section, we're going to need to shoot at the lights.
1761263	1762945	And then we're going to have to take out the guard.
1763325	1763565	Okay.
1764186	1764506	All right.
1764806	1766347	Now this is going to be completely different.
1766708	1769770	What I'm going to need you to do is I need you to shoot at the lights.
1770070	1771711	It's kind of funny.
1772152	1772692	I like that.
1773313	1782680	And then there was a mission with Pierce where they do a duet with – is it the song –
1786325	1787485	Opposites Attract or whatever.
1787986	1788746	Oh, the Paula Abdul song?
1788766	1789546	Yeah, it's Paula Abdul.
1790267	1793708	So they do that and they also sing some other songs on the radio.
1794169	1802073	But it's like that part right there kind of made me smile because that's the part where they're kind of getting down to what made the game as good.
1802133	1803433	It's like the personality in the game.
1803813	1812098	But a lot of the throughout the whole missions and stuff that this love letter to the fans is basically like, hey, remember how cool Saints Row 2 was?
1813118	1813679	and that's it.
1813840	1816024	It's like, hey, remember how cool Saints Row 2 was?
1816264	1817206	Hey, remember this guy?
1817366	1821154	Remember how you really did this really fucked up thing to get him back?
1821374	1823759	Remember how crazy shit was back in that?
1825286	1826507	Thanks for watching!
1847941	1849282	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1870810	1893145	or they're just reskins of weapons that were in other games and also what's up with you know them saying hey we're not going to have these missions where we're basically going to have you do the activities and kind of force you to do that no actually all that's in there in fact the last bits of the loyalty missions you have to do for your crew members are all the fucking activities in the game that's all it is they didn't even bother to think up new missions they just like
1893405	1895686	Hey, do this fucking activity because we developed it.
1895926	1908391	And the fact that they're basing a lot of these activities off of, what is it, Cyberblazing, which was in Saints Row the Third, which I think was the worst activity in the whole fucking game, and now they have a whole bunch based off of that.
1908611	1909832	It's just kind of annoying.
1910432	1911773	But the game is still good.
1911993	1921757	It's just it's sad because they remind you about how great the series was, and there are some moments that are still great, but it's kind of...
1922937	1924799	It's kind of like just going through the paces again.
1924819	1932424	They're not trying too hard, it seems like, because it's the same world.
1932685	1933986	It's based off the same engine.
1934006	1936668	Yeah, they tweaked some stuff, but the superpowers are fucking from the...
1937591	1940393	They were from the expansion for Saints Row 3rd.
1940793	1941514	Saints Row 3rd.
1941794	1943996	The superpowers were from Troubled Clones.
1944696	1945777	They're exactly the same.
1945817	1947999	They're just kind of built upon that.
1948559	1949720	That's my problem with it.
1949840	1958247	It's just... I don't see... I mean, there's going to be replayability because the PC version and the modding community is going to be great on it and stuff.
1958707	1962570	It's just been out for a little bit and they already have some pretty cool stuff available already, but...
1964256	1967437	Story-wise, I hope the last mission's really good.
1967537	1971579	That's what I'm hoping, but I just think it's going to be kind of a letdown.
1971799	1981883	Thank God they brought Gat back, because it's very clear once you rescue him and you're actually playing with him in some of the other missions, it's like, why the hell did they kill that guy off?
1982063	1984324	And the way they explained how he came back is brilliant.
1984544	1985065	I like that.
1985645	1987046	But it was just...
1988546	2001750	Once again, it's like, okay, he was a great part of Saints Row 2, and that's kind of why you need him back in the game, because it's going to be hard to figure out where they go for the fifth game from here.
2001770	2004971	They're going to have to scale it back, and I hope that they find a happy medium with number two.
2005131	2011913	When I'm listening to you kind of talk about your disappointment with it, I almost feel like you're saying that you kind of feel like it's still...
2017675	2032559	and that oh my gosh it's not really going to be a full game most people I've heard talk about it say that was really unfounded because they really did all this different stuff with the game and you do get that full game experience but the way you talk about it you make it sound like it is more of an expansion
2033199	2036982	It does seem like... I mean, there's a lot of... There's content in there.
2037942	2039623	There's missions that are pretty unique.
2040344	2045707	And, you know, I'll give them that because... And they do stand out quite well from everything else.
2046108	2052091	But a lot of it is just kind of in there just because, like, you know...
2055316	2060520	A lot of the stuff that they explain in the game is because you were hacking the simulation.
2061000	2066724	But the minigames in there and the activities that they have you do kind of don't make any sense.
2067684	2075430	I mean, yeah, I understand it's not supposed to make a ton of sense, but it really doesn't make any sense why it's in there other than it's a thing to do.
2075830	2079252	Why do I have to go in the simulation and throw balls at targets?
2079853	2079913	Or...
2081254	2085436	Why do I have to run along this path and collect glowing orbs and stuff?
2085996	2087557	Why do I have to... Why not?
2087617	2088518	It worked in Crackdown.
2089198	2089859	Exactly.
2090099	2091119	And that's the problem, too.
2091319	2095682	They took so much inspiration, if you will, from Crackdown.
2095822	2097243	It's fucking Crackdown.
2097743	2098884	It's got the superpowers.
2099044	2100325	What's the problem with that?
2100485	2102006	Everybody wants another Crackdown.
2102026	2106448	Crackdown got pretty boring after... Well, Crackdown didn't really have a single-player narrative to it.
2106648	2108589	It was basically like a, go here, kill guy.
2108729	2109530	Go here, kill guy.
2109910	2111492	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2129770	2130611	It's like, come on.
2130931	2131571	It's ridiculous.
2144406	2149907	You've played to 93% completion, so there must be something you really like about this.
2150207	2155808	I like the game and I want to get it done with so I can play Grand Theft Auto V. I've got to finish it before Grand Theft Auto V comes out.
2155828	2157028	Get this out of here.
2157108	2158308	I've got other things to do.
2158589	2159009	It's sad.
2159089	2163489	I like the game, but it feels very rushed.
2163549	2172051	And I know that the team at Volition is great and they worked on stuff, but I feel that they've done so much better work in the past
2172631	2175992	that, come on, there should be no excuse for this kind of stuff.
2176732	2180414	And, you know, I just don't know.
2180494	2191618	It's just, it's very, like, I understand what they were trying to do with it, but it just doesn't, maybe it's at the point now where they're like, well, crap, we've got to go crazier for, you know, the fourth game.
2192478	2193358	How do we do that?
2193478	2194679	Oh, we're going to do superpowers.
2194839	2197840	Okay, now, and then it's like, okay, well, we've got to think of a new weapon.
2197940	2201141	It's got to be really crazy because people are expecting crazy.
2201161	2201241	Yeah.
2201821	2209886	And that's the problem, is I think they've gotten stuck in that now, where everything has to be so over the top, and like, ooh, it's a cliche of this, ooh, it's a play on that.
2210727	2222655	Just, I think what they need to do, it's going to be interesting when they have that expansion, the first expansion come out, because they did something similar with Skyrim, the Skyrim team did, where it's like, okay, here's a week, develop something that you want to do.
2223275	2226418	and we'll put it in the game later on or we'll try to figure out a way for it.
2226498	2232764	And that's where a lot of the great content from Skyrim came from was that kind of like almost like internal game jam type thing.
2233184	2237508	And I really wish that that's what they would do for the fifth game where just put some good ideas together.
2237648	2241352	It would have been really cool for number four because it is a simulation.
2241992	2246914	Take chunks from Stillwater and Steelport and just smash it all together.
2247234	2250976	Just take shit from that old map and the Steelport map.
2251176	2258940	That would have at least made it different and interesting as opposed to just, okay, we're just going to dump the same map in there and throw some alien shit in the air and call it a day.
2259520	2259820	All right.
2259920	2261261	Going to our chat room with some comments.
2261301	2262581	Live.VogNetwork.com.
2262621	2266243	ShadowNextGen says, the homages in Saints Row 4 are amazing.
2266963	2269104	I still have to finish the game, so I can't write a review yet.
2269124	2271205	I haven't finished, I haven't done the last mission yet.
2271225	2271785	Fair enough.
2271805	2275167	I'm hoping that it just, you know, brings it all back, you know, but we'll see.
2290194	2293216	I don't know if you can do She-Ra, but I know that they have the Rainbow Brite costume.
2293236	2293357	Yeah.
2317145	2318786	That's pretty amazing as well, I gotta say.
2318806	2326050	But they do have the Thundercats thing where it's like... That's what I love about... Oh, I'm sorry.
2326550	2326850	Go ahead.
2327050	2328391	One other real quick gripe.
2328471	2330833	And this goes back to just game design and everything.
2331453	2336155	They have three different things that are assigned to the left and right directional pad.
2336836	2343780	Left and right directional pad are for selecting your abilities, your super abilities that you're using, or...
2344700	2351323	Also, for changing your radio station, and also for doing a taunt or compliment.
2352224	2357146	All of those have to do with, like, touch the button, hold the button for a little bit, or hold the button for a long time.
2357386	2358747	It's fucking stupid.
2359207	2361809	It's because, like, half the time, oh, I'm trying to do a taunt.
2362049	2363670	Oh, I'm sorry, I changed the radio station.
2363830	2365210	Oh, no, I changed my superpower.
2365530	2366491	It's, like, dumb.
2366611	2368072	That is completely stupid.
2368752	2368972	All right.
2369213	2370113	But they have a lot of this.
2370414	2373537	That's what I really love about Saints Row is all this over the top shit.
2373737	2375499	And so I need to check it out at some point.
2375519	2377201	They do have a lot of cool costumes in there.
2377321	2380745	So it'll be interesting to see what other stuff that they add on with DLC.
2380765	2382006	So far, they haven't gone crazy yet.
2382306	2382567	All right.
2383267	2384869	I'll quickly talk about my gaming week.
2385229	2390195	I've already talked ad nauseum about Final Fantasy 14, which honestly has been the majority of my time as the game is new.
2390595	2414667	but there is at least one other game I checked out this week on PlayStation 3 and this was partially a listener recommendation I want to say I don't remember who it was I don't remember if it was in chat or an email I apologize I just remember seeing it on the store and I was like oh yeah somebody told me I should get that and play that so I did download Tekken Revolution which is the free-to-play Tekken game that was that's on the PlayStation 3 now I don't know why I had it in my mind
2415487	2419309	I don't know why I thought that, but I did.
2420069	2421930	I downloaded it, and it's totally not.
2423070	2426131	Maybe that's where I'm crossing wires or something.
2426151	2427512	But anyway, it's not.
2427652	2428713	It has nothing to do with cards.
2429093	2433715	It's a straight-up fighting game, just like it was Tekken 7 or something on the consoles.
2434835	2438757	But it's a free-to-play game, which is weird, but I...
2440478	2443779	I actually really enjoyed it, come to think of it.
2444600	2457326	You know, it was free, and the way that they make their money is that you can play either, I think it's like you can do five player versus player matches, or two versus computer matches before you run out of energy.
2457767	2465951	But the computer matches are like arcade style, so if you win, you get to play again and again and again until you get up to like a boss that you kill, like seven people in.
2466551	2494917	and each time you win a match you get a little bit of cash you get a little bit of experience a little bit of these gift points the gift points you end up unlocking characters later on or so I hear I guess it takes a lot to do it because I haven't done it yet the money you can use to up the stats on your character for when you go fight later matches so either now I know I'm not that good at fighting games because I was about to say either I'm really good at fighting games but I know that's not the case
2495797	2496798	Martial Law Arcade Mode Normal
2515854	2516634	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2534941	2558326	a five round match because it's like two out of three and it went the full five rounds like they were equally matched with me and I was very impressed at that especially for a free game so if you like fighting games and you like Tekken why the fuck not it's free now here's how they get your money if you want to play more you got to buy tokens that you can use to play more matches later on
2558926	2561769	So there's little ways that they nickel and dime you in that regard.
2561829	2576502	But as far as a Facebook game on the PlayStation 3, but said Facebook game is like a Tekken 6 or something like that, even though I didn't really care for Tekken 6, but you know, if Tekken 6 had been free, I would have downloaded it and played it still and enjoyed it.
2576582	2578363	So, I mean, yeah.
2579184	2583007	I gotta say, I was pretty impressed by this little free-to-play fighter.
2583848	2584509	Overall...
2585229	2588331	I've been pretty impressed with the free-to-play offerings on PlayStation 3.
2589471	2591172	Jetpack Joyride's pretty good too.
2591573	2592773	There's another one I checked out.
2593233	2606260	So, I mean, honestly, if you're bored and don't really have anything to play right now, or maybe you can't afford to get a new game right now, or just nothing looks appealing to you, go look at what's free on PlayStation 3, because there's some pretty decent stuff.
2606621	2606861	I mean...
2607441	2616043	It's not going to be as amazing as The Last of Us or these other big AAA titles that are out right now, but it'll entertain you for a little while.
2616583	2619824	Well, even if you have PlayStation Plus, it's even better.
2619864	2624325	They announced during Gamescom, Assassin's Creed 3 is coming out later this year as free.
2624805	2625505	That's crazy.
2625545	2626546	That came out last year.
2626566	2628726	Yeah, crazy.
2628906	2630987	Well, the Hitman game was just out last year, too.
2631707	2632067	Crazy.
2632588	2633909	Saints Row the Third, if you haven't played it yet.
2634149	2634929	Yeah, so.
2636110	2640514	ShadowNextGen in chat says, Speaking of free-to-play, Plants vs. Zombies 2 is awesome.
2640674	2643656	I gotta put that on my queue because I've been wanting to try that.
2643856	2645017	I haven't been able to try that yet.
2646418	2649981	That's really the only new game I can think of to talk about this week is Plants vs. Zombies.
2651021	2651502	Excuse me.
2652182	2653423	That's what the chatter can think about.
2653443	2656425	That's the only new game I can think to talk about otherwise is Tekken Revolution.
2656906	2657106	Yeah.
2657588	2658008	Good times.
2658769	2659069	All right.
2660050	2660950	Let's move on.
2661811	2662432	Housekeeping.
2662472	2665854	I pretty much already talked about what I wanted to talk about as far as DragonCon and so forth.
2666374	2670097	The only other thing I'll say for housekeeping is that remember there is no live show next week.
2670477	2672779	So enjoy your week off for Labor Day, whatever you're doing.
2672799	2673299	It's a dead show.
2673740	2675381	It's a dead show next week.
2675661	2683947	And before I forget, given that we will not have a show next week, I would like to wish my fellow individuals of the Jewish Persuasion, Lashana Tova, Happy New Year.
2684708	2684828	So...
2685188	2685628	There you go.
2686468	2688469	Any Labor Day greetings to give the listener?
2688569	2690250	It's not a Labor Day greeting.
2690730	2692131	That time of year, you know what I mean?
2692471	2693371	My dad's birthday.
2693411	2694671	I wish my dad a happy birthday.
2695412	2696892	It's the birthday of September 2nd.
2698593	2700213	You doing anything over the holiday, Loki?
2700233	2701234	You going to barbecue or anything?
2701254	2705936	I was going to go to my dad's for dinner on Saturday, I think.
2705956	2706476	There you go.
2709297	2709857	That's about it.
2710884	2712145	How about you, DarkSakura?
2712805	2713966	I'm going to be busy being Jewish.
2714666	2715607	Nothing wrong with that.
2716667	2719288	Say hi to your synagogue friends.
2719568	2721469	To the Jew crew, as Dan calls them.
2721489	2722530	Dan calls them the Jew crew.
2722950	2729473	Ideally, Grand Theft Auto V would have leaked out by then, but I can't make any guarantees there.
2729854	2731234	There's some fun people in the Jew crew.
2731254	2732595	When are we getting some of them back on the show?
2733072	2736254	I know, but we had a really rousing game of Cards Against Humanity.
2736314	2736454	I bet.
2736474	2740696	And it was the first time that, except for me, that any of us had played the game.
2741537	2742297	It was very fun.
2743077	2743378	All right.
2744378	2747260	And you're getting some New Year wishes back there in the chat room from SHA100, Matt.
2747300	2747660	Yep.
2748220	2748760	Thank you.
2748961	2749341	All right.
2749441	2753343	And Yom Kippur is on the 16th, and I will be busy fasting all day.
2754423	2755204	Is that on a Sunday?
2756144	2756384	No.
2756645	2758367	If it was on a Sunday, I wouldn't be here.
2759368	2760349	I tell you in advance.
2761230	2763253	I don't want to put up with a Jamie who hasn't eaten.
2763533	2765256	It's actually all day on Saturday.
2765276	2766197	I think it's on a Saturday.
2768359	2768660	Anyhow.
2770202	2770983	No show next week.
2772144	2773146	I'm at DragonCon.
2773486	2774687	If you're going to PAX...
2775328	2791620	Extrofer from Horde House will be there so keep an eye out for him he will be our lone VOG representative at PAX because his partner has family in Seattle so that was the better option for him to go kind of make a trip out of that so they're off to PAX whereas the rest of us are DragonCon
2792601	2793902	All right, let's move on.
2794163	2795004	Time for gaming news.
2795104	2797506	And there was quite a bit of it this week with Gamescom and all that, right, Loki?
2797646	2799228	Yes, lots of big announcements.
2799768	2804573	Sony came through with what they said they were planning on doing, which was announcing their release plans.
2804693	2805534	And so with that...
2806004	2806904	Thank you for watching!
2823590	2825412	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2844210	2867333	Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK, and I guess Latin America, also Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Mexico, Panama, and Peru.
2869094	2872117	and the US or North America as well, obviously.
2873338	2873718	And Japan.
2874439	2874859	Can't forget.
2875219	2876620	Although no date for Japan yet, right?
2877941	2882986	WhatUpG in chat says, Sony has a press event in September probably to announce the Japanese PlayStation 4 date.
2883006	2884367	Yeah, that's Tokyo Game Show.
2884787	2886328	Would that mean maybe later?
2886628	2887649	That they get it later?
2887669	2891071	I'm thinking that they're probably going to be, it's going to be around the same time.
2891271	2893733	It could be later, but I think it's probably... Because that's not usual.
2893793	2895314	PlayStation 3, they got it earlier.
2895334	2896955	And I want to say PlayStation 2, they did too.
2897075	2903239	They could launch, you know, between that time or like, you know, it's going to be around the same time, I think.
2903620	2904820	You know, probably in November still.
2905401	2905581	Hmm.
2906061	2906381	Alrighty.
2907642	2908503	But, uh, yeah.
2910094	2912797	I did not get to watch the Sony press conference.
2912897	2915059	I don't know if you watched it, but what did you think of it?
2915619	2916300	I thought it was good.
2916500	2919443	It was very reminiscent of E3.
2920584	2927610	It was weird in the beginning because they basically had someone on stage playing the PlayStation 4 and showing kind of the interface and stuff.
2927950	2930833	Also kind of showing that, hey, we're pretty much done with this thing.
2931013	2932835	Like, you know, it's ready to go.
2932855	2933655	That's good, though.
2933835	2934596	Yes, that's good.
2934696	2939841	So, you know, definitely we're going to get into a lot more of it.
2939881	2942483	But, you know, still focused on, like, indie stuff.
2942503	2944085	They announced some new IPs.
2945406	2950190	You know, talked more about release dates for different things like, you know, Gran Turismo and stuff.
2950911	2953153	And then showed off a lot of the things that, like,
2954313	2958115	Just kind of pulled a few punches still against CM Microsoft.
2959656	2961997	Oh yeah, there was a big sick burn at the end, wasn't there?
2962418	2963178	There was a couple, yeah.
2963378	2968761	Something about the whole like, and while others have changed their message... I'm going from memory here, this is an exact quote.
2969141	2974204	While where others have changed their messages, we have stayed consistent with our... There was definitely a little...
2974944	2976226	The Shade Throne.
2976286	2979771	Somebody brought the umbrella to the Sony press conference to make some shade.
2979911	2983617	Yes, it was interesting.
2984277	2988463	Well, this is a fun time of year because you know who's the winner in this scenario when these two companies are fighting?
2988704	2989365	Us, the gamers.
2991078	3018370	hopefully yeah Loki you look a little skeptical at that comment uh yeah we're the winners I think all right all right well let's get into some of those specifics that Loki mentioned a minute ago um here's one about uh and I believe they've announced something similar to this on the Microsoft platform so uh this is you know just kind of meeting the challenge here I think this is through PlayStation Network and I think a lot of it though they're talking more like retailer stuff like Amazon and GameStop doing something similar
3018530	3018790	Gotcha.
3018830	3019851	Well, here's what we're talking about.
3019891	3022031	The discount upgrade program.
3022251	3023392	That's what we're talking about here.
3024092	3039758	Apparently, there will be a program where if you buy these games on the PlayStation 3, and these are select games, not necessarily everything, but select games, you'll have the ability to upgrade to the PlayStation 4 version for a, here's my quotey fingers, significantly discounted price.
3040765	3043928	Call of Duty Ghosts, Assassin's Creed 4, Black Flag, Watch Dogs, Battlefield 4
3063526	3088552	Activision and Warner Brothers also publishers that are partnering with Sony on this initiative the upgrade initiative do not know yet if it's a worldwide initiative but certainly for North America at least and if Japan's getting something similar I'm sure that will be detailed at Tokyo Game Show now some other details here even though I just said expect $20 discounts Call of Duty Ghosts has said $10 not $10 off $10 off
3092639	3093440	Call of Duty Ghosts
3112580	3118841	And I would think who this is going to most apply to are the people that are just like, not this year for the PlayStation 4.
3119402	3127343	They're going to get their PlayStation 4s in 2014, you know, when some more software comes out, when next year's holiday lineup starts coming out.
3127943	3132324	That's when people want to upgrade their games, but this program is not going to be available by then, right, Loki?
3132344	3132905	I don't know.
3133225	3138906	I didn't really see a time frame, and I think it's more of like, let's play it by ear and see what happens and...
3139566	3158921	you know it's all gonna be because why would you purchase you know Call of Duty Ghosts and then two weeks later you're gonna get your PlayStation 4 or whatever and oh and I gotta buy the PlayStation 4 version as well it's like you would think that you would just kind of wait it out a little bit yeah but I mean I understand you know
3159681	3168788	I can also see folks that are going to have PlayStation 4s under their Christmas trees or their menorahs or whatever you celebrate in the winter season, right?
3169448	3174912	That you might end up with a PlayStation 4 there when you've bought all these PlayStation 3 games.
3175473	3178015	But I'm kind of like, if you're going to buy a bunch of PlayStation 3 games...
3180905	3181325	and DarkSakura.
3205598	3213223	All right, now Sony wanted to be clear that these upgrade prices, such as the one that we just mentioned for Call of Duty Ghosts, they are going to be set by the publisher.
3213263	3214964	It's not something Sony is going to regulate.
3215024	3220687	A little bit of a clarification here from UK Managing Director Fergal Gara in an interview with Digital Spy.
3221047	3221327	Quote,
3222788	3230970	is the PlayStation 4 digital file will be made available on the PlayStation Store as it would be anyway at launch and the PS3 discs will be sold through retail.
3231310	3244052	What the consumer can then do for a premium to be defined by the publisher is access the PlayStation 4 digital game and then provided they still have the PlayStation 3 disc, they will be able to play the PlayStation 4 version when they decide to buy the next gen.
3244292	3250053	That's a pretty clever solution because that doesn't allow you to like game fly your PS3 game and then upgrade it.
3250553	3259618	if your PS3 disc is in the drive you can use the PlayStation 4 digital version that's a clever little way to do it yeah
3261192	3261612	That's all.
3261652	3262893	I don't got anything to say.
3262973	3264354	It was a clever little workaround.
3266195	3270477	I mean, it's not that much different than, let's say, the Xbox 360.
3270797	3275520	You install a game to your hard drive on the 360, you still require the disk and the drive, right?
3276060	3280522	Now we're seeing that bridging between two systems, which is kind of neat.
3280922	3285805	Especially in light of the fact that the PlayStation 4 is not backwards compatible, which is frustrating to some people.
3285845	3291688	I'm wondering if that would work different than... Well, obviously it would work different if you bought a digital version of the game, I guess.
3293608	3294529	You wouldn't have to do that.
3296370	3298130	Alright, well let's move on with some more news.
3298511	3298951	DarkSakura.
3300831	3301071	Twitch
3323210	3324812	It was at GamersCon.
3324893	3329841	They basically said that players would be able to broadcast over Twitch channels.
3330342	3332846	So there goes the need for a capture card.
3332866	3334208	You'll just be doing it online.
3334228	3335750	Which is pretty cool.
3337520	3337940	DarkSakura.com
3358212	3362676	Um, but Twitch is a very popular streaming solution for people.
3363397	3370244	And, uh, in fact, there isn't a lot of competition out there to Twitch, which really surprises me, meaning like focused on video game.
3370264	3370825	I know there's others.
3370865	3374689	I've heard of one called Owned, but nothing on that same scale of Twitch.
3375210	3375370	So...
3376611	3379872	I'm seeing this type of stuff kind of break through on the mainstream media too.
3379992	3388974	Like I was seeing something on either CNN or Yahoo or one of those sites where they were talking about, you know, more people watch Twitch TV than some basic cable channels.
3390115	3390355	True.
3391615	3395116	So it's very much a new medium or new media.
3395536	3404419	And now everybody's going to get to do their own broadcast right from their PlayStation 4 or their Xbox One to be fair, which is detailed a similar plan.
3404439	3404939	I think it's cool.
3405379	3405559	Yeah.
3406155	3407357	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3422856	3424317	Yeah, I kind of wish that there was a way.
3424397	3428880	I mean, I'm not too familiar with all the export options that they have available.
3429200	3436684	Like, if you can export those files, like you can... Because I know they have the sharing stuff that you can do where you can share clips online.
3436945	3442508	But I wonder if you can, like, export a huge file or something to, like, YouTube or export it to your computer and edit it.
3442988	3446852	If it's saving to the Twitch website, you can export Twitch videos to YouTube.
3446892	3451877	I have a Let's Play the Slender Man where I screamed very high-pitched when I saw Slender Man.
3451937	3455280	That's on my YouTube, which is Rob Roberts Plays, I think, on my YouTube channel.
3455741	3457002	And that was an export from Twitch.
3457344	3462147	I think this whole thing bodes well for Twitch itself, just given that they're also going to have the Xbox deal too.
3462567	3463607	Oh yeah, this is huge for them.
3464108	3469330	And remember, Twitch started as, and they still run it, Justin.TV, which was streaming your life.
3470211	3475313	And I think in some ways, I'm just going to give you guys real talk from my perspective.
3475333	3479836	I think Justin.TV kind of became a joke in some ways because it kind of became a lot of cam whores.
3480436	3486922	and people that were like, you know, pay me $5 and I'll show you my titty or show you my junk or whatever.
3487302	3492327	It's kind of what, even though you're not supposed to have adult content, that's what a lot of that life casting turned into.
3492687	3505279	But it's really great that those guys kind of thought ahead and, you know, kind of grabbed on this gaming thing that was going on that was a little more, you know, a little more serious, I guess.
3506380	3506520	So...
3507580	3507860	All right.
3508940	3510341	Anyhow, I plan to use this.
3510361	3511101	It'll be fun.
3511441	3518022	Yeah, I'll definitely check it out, especially since I finally got around to playing around with my video capture equipment, the new stuff.
3519343	3523324	Some of the stuff I might be capturing with the brand new Twitch feature on PlayStation 4.
3524404	3527325	Minecraft is a big surprise.
3527385	3529185	This was something that was kind of...
3530506	3534068	It was a very quick reveal.
3534168	3538031	They didn't really show anything other than a logo and some people walking by in costume.
3538491	3540733	And not even really costume, but with a mask on.
3541093	3545036	But yes, Minecraft will be coming to the PlayStation 4 at launch.
3545677	3547998	And it's also coming to PlayStation 3 and the Vita.
3548819	3549699	And they're...
3552160	3562408	I gotta say, internet, seriously, people on Twitter, don't harass the Xbox support people regarding, like, announcements and shit.
3562748	3577298	Xbox support is for helping people with shit that's wrong on your Xbox, not saying, Hey, I see Minecraft, you know, which was, you know, originally a console exclusive for Xbox 360, it's coming to PlayStation 4, how do you like them apples?
3577338	3578239	You know, that type of shit.
3579244	3591067	Technically, if you want to get into it there, yes, Microsoft has an exclusive on Minecraft, the Xbox 360 edition, and Minecraft, the Xbox One edition.
3591568	3596869	Minecraft on the PlayStation 4 will be created by yet a different company other than 4J Studios.
3597269	3607092	And so, yes, it will be technically exclusive to PlayStation 4, whereas a different version of Minecraft is exclusive to the Xbox platforms.
3607512	3608212	There, you're done.
3608312	3611733	Stop emailing those people or stop tweeting to them.
3612233	3618155	And yes, they're saying that it's created by Microsoft Studios, so therefore it is exclusive to Xbox.
3618175	3620695	Yes, their version of the game is exclusive to Xbox.
3620755	3626377	Yeah, Bobby Blackwolf in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com kind of echoing the same sentiment there.
3626457	3629938	Microsoft Xbox 360 Edition is still an Xbox 360 exclusive.
3630118	3630838	Yes, exactly.
3631738	3635639	I would be interested to see what differences there are in it.
3635859	3638200	Yeah, it would be very interesting to see that.
3640281	3641301	So yeah, so there's that.
3641401	3646183	And then, of course, other wonderful console exclusives.
3647763	3656646	And this is basically talking a little bit about the indie games because they were a big focus on the presentation.
3657106	3684065	and some of their exclusives they're saying are going to be Hotline Miami 2, N++, Starbound, let's see, Volume, which is done by the guy that did Thomas Was Alone, Rogue Legacy, Wasteland Kings, and Everybody's Gone Through the Rapture, which I love the parody account, was it the Kazurai parody account who said, yeah, it's a sequel to Everybody's Golf.
3684365	3685065	Yeah.
3686246	3686686	A little dark.
3687026	3687946	Yeah.
3688066	3688547	So there's that.
3688587	3689867	And then, of course, other things.
3690367	3695668	The Binding of Isaac Rebirth, Velocity 2X, and Guns of Icarus Online.
3697669	3700249	And I guess Velocity, I think it was Velocity.
3701030	3701810	No, it wasn't Velocity.
3701830	3707551	There's another game they announced free that was going to be available for PlayStation 4 with PlayStation Plus.
3707631	3712873	So you're going to get quite a lineup of free games, especially indie titles, at launch.
3713793	3714653	It'll be interesting.
3715259	3721783	Alright, well, this is a little awkward, but these things happen, especially in live radio.
3722243	3725225	I think we're going to say goodbye to Jamie for now, right?
3725485	3731609	Yeah, basically the allergy thing is getting to the point where I'm now lightheaded.
3731669	3734991	Okay, but you are safe to drive, because I don't want you leaving here if you can't drive.
3735031	3738653	Because you can go lie down in the other room if you need to during the show.
3738954	3744237	If I do it now, I'll be okay, but I know how my...
3745017	3746057	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
3769502	3770543	I love that we just gave away a secret.
3792001	3792902	It's alright, no, it's fine.
3792922	3796645	Well, no, we'd been out drinking all night, and I crashed out on her bed.
3796985	3798966	And then I came out, of course, fully sober.
3800307	3800808	Excuse me.
3801989	3806712	And then I smell where it had been lit in the front room.
3807013	3808894	And then I went and threw up everything.
3808954	3809234	Oh, yeah.
3809615	3811476	Anyway, we can reminisce another time.
3811916	3813437	Take care of yourself, for heaven's sake.
3813718	3814618	Thank you.
3814718	3815399	Sorry, kids.
3815639	3816800	Thank you for the well wishes.
3817900	3820581	Any last minute thoughts?
3820981	3846205	I think I realized what made myself worse I brought the one thing I thought would be quick and easy to cook and that was Pollock Paneer The Trader Joe's ones uses chilies and I have a super bad chili allergy so that's probably my own fault Allergy plus allergy equals super allergy Yeah I've got tea at home and I've got lots of Benadryl and Sudafed and NyQuil so I might pass out either that or you'll see me in chat
3846673	3846933	All right.
3846973	3848274	Well, we hope to hear from you later.
3848335	3849355	Feel better, for heaven's sake.
3849876	3852658	And such is the risk of doing live radio.
3852718	3854760	Loki and I will hold down the fort here for the rest of the night.
3854900	3855421	Thank you, guys.
3855461	3855681	All right.
3855701	3856182	Drive safe.
3856822	3861667	If you need me, call my phone, and I will make sure my ringer is on.
3862908	3864269	And if you need me, call me.
3864849	3867432	You can have your 3DS charger back now.
3867592	3868212	That's fine.
3868232	3868613	Thank you.
3869393	3869754	Okay.
3871124	3871624	Back to it.
3871764	3874365	AlanAlchemy in chat says, Mark down that timestamp.
3874405	3875145	That's an edit.
3875465	3877326	No, it's live and it's funny.
3878586	3882308	SSJ100Matt says, Everyone's allergies change after several years.
3884028	3884388	All right.
3884829	3888070	Tigerclaw in chat says, Sky, isn't everyone allergic to marijuana?
3888130	3889110	It smells so bad.
3890470	3890951	Trust me.
3891031	3898133	I know some people that if they're allergic to marijuana, then they are gluttons for punishment because plenty of it.
3899298	3902139	Well, did I tell you about how I found out I had an allergy to it?
3902159	3904280	It was a girl's bathroom at school.
3906260	3912663	And all the other bathrooms were being cleaned, so I went to the front bathroom that was by the office, which ironically is the one that everyone smokes pot in.
3914223	3919365	And I got in there, and I was so sick in the stall that I had to turn around and throw up.
3919505	3920505	And then I had a rash.
3920845	3921165	No fun.
3921505	3922146	On my face.
3922826	3923346	It was awful.
3923426	3923946	No fun at all.
3924006	3924246	All right.
3924266	3925387	You're going to be okay?
3925567	3925847	You sure?
3926187	3926447	All right.
3927067	3927307	Drive safe.
3927327	3927988	Love you guys.
3928048	3928348	Bye.
3928568	3928828	All right.
3930478	3932060	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3947279	3949900	Oh, the music, man.
3950300	3951240	No, no, no, hold on.
3951260	3956302	I bet you that there's quite a few marijuana-inspired levels in LittleBigPlanet.
3957022	3961344	I guarantee that there's like, hey, I'm going to totally put pot leaves everywhere.
3961824	3964905	In this level, you've got to get stowed.
3965745	3975669	If there's a level dedicated to, what was her name, that actress, Parker Posey, that was my favorite LittleBigPlanet level I ever played was the Parker Posey level.
3976370	3980018	Which was like creepy stalker almost, but I loved it.
3980139	3980419	Anyway.
3980439	3982003	So.
3984306	3992092	LittleBigPlanet Hub is a free-to-play service coming to the PlayStation 3 that's going to have many elements of the LittleBigPlanet universe.
3992752	4001699	LittleBigPlanet Hub will allow players to collaborate with online teammates for challenges, level creation, wardrobe coordination via a redesigned shop interface.
4002620	4008284	LittleBigPlanet Hub is said to offer unrestricted access to LittleBigPlanet's Create Mode.
4009264	4012206	16 levels taken from previous LittleBigPlanet games on the PlayStation 3.
4012926	4018289	And then the hub-exclusive Team Picks will highlight a new batch of community-created levels every week.
4018609	4022271	And the new weekly challenges mode boasts a whole new way to play LittleBigPlanet.
4022291	4025353	I'm curious if that's going to have access to all the levels that are created out there.
4025373	4028234	Because if that's the case, then you probably don't need a single-player version of the game.
4028254	4031815	Well, and also, it does sound like, though, they might nickel and dime some of the content.
4031875	4038318	Like, because, you know, in the create mode in the games, you have to unlock that by playing the single player mode.
4038378	4038898	Oh, sure, yeah.
4039438	4046340	So, it's like, if you want to, you know, you can create these levels, but if you want to use the grappling hook gun, you're going to have to buy that.
4046781	4049582	If you want to use, you know, I think that's how they're going to do it.
4049622	4055123	You'll be able to make very basic levels, but you won't be able to make the really good stuff without buying some of the nickel and dime levels.
4055143	4055744	But I understand.
4056124	4056424	Great play.
4056764	4057825	What do you need?
4057885	4058606	Yep, free to play.
4058946	4060627	Allows you to get your foot in the door.
4060887	4065511	But if I'm not mistaken, LittleBigPlanet 2 is still a PlayStation Plus title, right?
4066142	4066543	No.
4066823	4067083	No?
4067244	4067564	I thought it was.
4067584	4068645	LittleBigPlanet Cardiness.
4068925	4069086	Ah.
4069926	4070627	Gotcha.
4070928	4074211	But LittleBigPlanet 2 right now, it's gotta be dirt cheap.
4074672	4077635	I mean, it's been a long time since it's been out.
4077695	4078456	I mean, so.
4078956	4079116	Right.
4079257	4079737	Should be alright.
4080378	4080718	Alright.
4081259	4083261	Alright, so League of Legends.
4083661	4083902	Yes.
4085684	4086384	They got hacked.
4087365	4098135	And apparently there was info that was accessed and that includes usernames, email addresses, salted passwords, and credit card numbers as well.
4098575	4110045	But once again, those were salted, which means they're encrypted and they have some random stuff thrown in there as well to make it difficult to unencrypt it.
4110465	4116814	So while that stuff was leaked out, you probably just want to change your login and password information because that's pretty much the only thing that they do have access to.
4117415	4125886	And you obviously, you know, if you use the same login and password combination on other sites, it's going to be the first thing they try.
4126927	4128049	Make sure you change that stuff.
4128149	4143145	I wouldn't worry too much about the credit card information and the billing information stuff because that stuff was encrypted and it looks like that it would be difficult for them to crack all that stuff.
4143505	4160674	but still never good to hear that again and League of Legends is a huge game too it's not good to hear that they got hacked now luckily I used a unique password for League of Legends because I just kind of thought something like this might happen but now I'm going to need a second unique password because they're going to make everybody change it I haven't logged in in a week though
4162096	4166561	Yeah, they say that they're taking appropriate action to notify and safeguard affected players.
4167142	4171587	We'll be contacting these players via email addresses currently associated with their accounts to alert them.
4172048	4176473	Our investigation is ongoing and we take all the necessary steps to protect players.
4178689	4179029	All right.
4179469	4181770	Well, you didn't have a League of Legends account, so you don't have to worry about it, right?
4181790	4182470	Nope, don't play it.
4182890	4183950	So, not a problem.
4184010	4184670	Lucky you.
4184851	4185551	Yep, yep, yep.
4185591	4185911	Lucky you.
4185951	4190532	All right, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and what's coming out to a gaming store near you.
4190552	4191512	A few things this week.
4191832	4194433	Lost Planet 3 on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
4195753	4197594	Little known fact about Lost Planet 3.
4198094	4202195	I don't think Capcom thinks it's going to do very well, so they're not making any reprints of it.
4203075	4205716	Once the launch quantities are gone, it's gone, apparently.
4205836	4206216	Really?
4206837	4207657	I don't believe that, though.
4207677	4213659	If it were to do very well, which I kind of agree with Capcom in this regard, I don't think it will do very well, sorry.
4214820	4217381	But if it does, I mean, they could always just reprint it.
4217521	4217981	Yeah, they could.
4218041	4221942	Isn't that what they did with, like, Katamari Damacy and some of these other minimally printed games?
4221962	4228705	And I think that a lot of that is just to get the buzz out there so that information gets out so they're like, oh, I need to get it because I won't be able to get it otherwise.
4229187	4235169	Final Fantasy XIV out this week on PC and PlayStation 3.
4236390	4241172	Killer is Dead on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 if you're a fan of Suda51.
4241332	4247855	Too bad Jamie left, but Hatsune Miku, Project Diva F on PlayStation 3 this week.
4248135	4251036	Should be excited about that.
4251056	4255278	Last but not least, Madden NFL 25 coming out.
4256158	4258119	Oh, and Painkiller, Hell and Damnation on PS3.
4260067	4269157	All right, let's travel to Japan and then maybe you can pick up the UK dates here that we would usually do because I'm trying to replace the classic game of the week here because I don't want to take Jamie's game.
4269697	4270898	I'm working frantically on that.
4273761	4274942	All while we're doing live radio.
4275743	4284347	So, trying to go to the Japanese release dates, and here they are on the PlayStation 3 this week on August the 27th.
4284407	4288109	Final Fantasy XIV makes its way to Japan as well.
4288149	4292151	The name there, Final Fantasy XIV Online, Shinsei Yorza.
4292831	4311301	and Eorza is the name of the realm that we all play in like Azeroth is in World of Warcraft so I'm assuming that is their own interpretation of what we have as the subtitle Realm Reborn that is out in Japan on the 27th as well on the 29th which I believe is Thursday which is a more typical release day there
4312221	4314843	End of Eternity, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure All-Star Battle, and Lost Planet 3.
4315223	4318505	Xbox 360 has Monster Hunter Frontier G Anniversary 2013 Premium Package.
4335035	4336076	Ragnarok Odyssey Ace Ragnarok Odyssey
4358594	4363115	Ace, I think, was one that was on DS or 3DS.
4363135	4365956	I think that's a new re-release or something.
4366296	4367736	Not a re-release, but a port.
4369637	4372057	Sadly, no Wii U games this week.
4372677	4377859	I saw some Disney Infinity on my list, but I think some people over there are importing ours.
4379700	4380720	Disney is very popular in Japan.
4380841	4381301	I can imagine, yeah.
4398955	4425847	Nintendo 3DS gets Sherlock Holmes Puzzle City and Starry Sky in Autumn 3D in regular and limited edition and I was going to see real quick if there's anything on the PSP because believe it or not they still get releases there once in a while and Solomon's Ring Elemental Pack comes out on the Sony PSP I completely forgot actually on the PSP this week Sweet Fuse At Your Side I think is the name and that's a PSP title coming out over here huh
4426047	4427888	Visual Novel, Axis, go figure.
4428048	4428448	There you go.
4428989	4430569	Putting out those Visual Novel titles, man.
4431430	4434231	All right, just a couple more stories for you guys, and then the classic game of the week.
4435252	4435692	Let's see.
4435792	4440714	In the UK, we're getting Castlevania Lords of Shadows, and this is on PC.
4440735	4441915	I'm assuming that's coming to Steam.
4442215	4445077	Final Fantasy XIV Realm Reborn on PlayStation 3 and PC.
4446217	4448398	Also on Mac, Bioshock Infinite.
4448438	4450519	I believe it's also coming out here as well on Steam.
4450899	4453680	Guardians of Middle-Earth, also a PC release.
4454980	4458742	They're getting E3 and Odyssey 4, Legends of the Titan on 3DS.
4459482	4462163	Killer is Dead on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
4462643	4465424	Also Lost Planet 3 on Xbox 360.
4465824	4468485	PlayStation 3 and PC, of course PC being on Steam.
4469886	4475811	Rayman Legends actually coming out a little bit early over there on Wii U and PC, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3.
4477152	4482436	And then some stuff that doesn't have a date on it, but it's just marked August.
4482857	4485239	The Walking Dead 400 Days and Payday 2.
4485299	4490583	I'm not sure if that stuff's already been out yet, but it is over here, so... I don't know.
4491960	4492401	That's it.
4493262	4493562	All right.
4494844	4498849	So let's talk a little bit about some other stuff that we discussed during the PlayStation conference.
4498869	4503576	Actually, a lot of this was leaked out beforehand, but the Vita got a price drop.
4503596	4505539	$199 in the US and $199 in Europe.
4510211	4518218	Also, it should be mentioned that the PlayStation 3 12GB system came out here as well because it is in Europe.
4518939	4520060	And that's also $199.
4520180	4523303	So PlayStation 3 and Vita for $199.
4523943	4525245	And they actually do have a bundle too.
4526305	4530850	The $199 price point is for the 3G one and they also have the Walking Dead.
4531230	4532231	They have a bundle that's also $199 as well.
4532251	4532291	So...
4533632	4533812	And, um...
4561089	4561549	Killzone.
4561629	4562370	Killzone will be good.
4562530	4564451	That's supposed to be actually a really good first-person shooter.
4565752	4579320	I heard rumors that they may do a Vita version of Ghosts, but it would have to be somebody other than... I can't remember the developer, but the guys that did fucking Resistance and Call of Duty last year that just sucked.
4579721	4580721	They were terrible.
4581702	4584964	So as long as they get somebody else to develop that, it would be pretty good.
4585024	4586525	Borderlands 2 is going to help too, so...
4587626	4588026	Will it?
4588227	4594095	Because I'm going to be honest, when I heard the news about Borderlands 2 on the Vita, I was kind of like, don't get me wrong, Borderlands 2, awesome game.
4594615	4600743	I know people are really into it and rightfully so, but I'm kind of like, hasn't everybody who's going to get Borderlands 2 already got it?
4600784	4601524	Alright, alright, alright.
4602185	4602826	Minecraft.
4604061	4604422	True.
4604862	4605242	True.
4606663	4608564	That could be said for a lot of games, I guess.
4609225	4610665	Minecraft on the go, man.
4610766	4620652	And I understand, yeah, they have the Pocket Edition, but if this version is a little bit more like the PC version, it's all sorts of greatness.
4622333	4624755	Too bad maybe it could talk to the PC version.
4624855	4626517	Or the PS3 version would be very awesome.
4627017	4633002	It would be awesome if it was... Well, I don't think you could do the PS4, but if all three versions talk to each other, that would be fantastic.
4633422	4637846	Sony's not as much of a hard-ass on the PC communicating with...
4638326	4639227	Sony servers.
4639307	4646973	I mean, we see DC Universe Online is on both, even though I don't think their servers are cross-play, but Final Fantasy XIV just came out, and it's cross-play between the two.
4648855	4652178	There's something else I'm thinking of that's PC and PlayStation cross.
4652258	4654379	Oh, well, like the whole Steam integration into Portal?
4654480	4666590	I think the problem, though, with doing that is a lot of it, they have to develop the engine to be similar because they want the same draw distance and same features in there, and if one is significantly less power than the other one, they can't really do that.
4667590	4668871	I don't know.
4669031	4672552	Anyway, so yeah, Borderlands 2, that's supposed to be coming in 2014 sometime.
4672833	4675374	I'm thinking maybe holiday because, you know, no date yet.
4675654	4679155	Really good comment from Monty Boggs in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com.
4679516	4684038	If I can transfer PlayStation 3 data, Borderlands 2 Vita would be tempting.
4684738	4685659	and Transfaring.
4685839	4688341	Wasn't that the whole term that Konami came up with a while ago?
4688402	4689543	Transfaring your data?
4690183	4690944	They could.
4691585	4692105	I'll give you that.
4692185	4694628	That is a pretty good reason to do it.
4696029	4700713	The whole thing would depend on if the game is going to have all the same guns in it.
4701074	4704117	If they develop all the same assets that are in the
4704817	4705117	and so on.
4721287	4724271	If they have all the things... Well, shouldn't it all be in the cloud?
4724292	4725513	Just upload it to the cloud!
4725954	4731241	It all depends, though, because if they have all that information, maybe they could do it without the guns.
4731361	4731762	I don't know.
4733144	4733845	It's possible.
4733905	4735447	Depends on the content that's in the game.
4735527	4737911	I think they could bring in all the guns, but we'll see.
4738992	4747758	Also, the Vita memory cards, one of the things that people are complaining about a lot because they are pretty expensive, are being reduced in price as well.
4748819	4753122	So, apparently, there are... I don't remember the final amounts to those.
4753803	4754223	Let's see.
4754383	4755944	So, the Vita memory cards.
4756025	4759867	Previously, for example, 4GB memory card is now $14.99, whereas originally $20.00.
4762289	4764971	The 8GB memory card is now $19.99, where it was $30.
4765011	4765752	$16 is $39.99, where it was $60.
4765852	4767653	And the 32GB card is $80, where it was $100.
4767773	4769394	So they are knocking the price off of those.
4769414	4771815	It still sucks that it's proprietary, but...
4781809	4782509	What are you going to do?
4782930	4790434	Might as well invest in a pretty big memory card because especially if you do PlayStation Plus, get a bunch of free games.
4790755	4794157	I think that's also another strong point if they market that well enough.
4794197	4799780	It's like, hey, you buy a PlayStation Vita, you get PlayStation Plus, you can download a ton of fucking games.
4800441	4800941	So why not?
4801781	4812804	If they can really bring... If the Vita has a renaissance or whatever you want to call it where it really does kind of seem to take off this holiday season and essentially resurrect from the dead, you can't tell me that the Wii U can't do the same thing.
4813145	4815885	They need a price drop because the Wii U is still $349.
4815965	4819406	That's not going to cut it.
4819446	4828369	We have something later on that might sweeten the pot a little bit, but I kind of agree that there's going to need to be a hard drop or Nintendo's going to be in trouble, but...
4829306	4831511	Not that there's not a lot of great games coming, but...
4834912	4839595	to register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com.
4839955	4841636	Use the passphrase, judge.
4842577	4843337	All right, anyhow.
4844758	4850002	Let's move on to one more story here about Killer Instinct and some new information that came out about the game this week.
4850462	4857947	One of those details, in the free-to-play version of Killer Instinct, you will be able to buy the additional characters for $5 each.
4858447	4862610	Killer Instinct will be free to play with one character when the console comes out.
4862890	4870315	There will be a $19.99 combo breaker pack that unlocks the game's full roster of 8 characters.
4871195	4876999	Including 2 of them that are exclusive fighters that are not initially available for individual purchase.
4877059	4882282	Meaning if you do piecemeal your game, you will have 6 fighters to choose from.
4882762	4889206	There will also be a $40 Ultra Edition that will bundle all playable characters online.
4889386	4903521	Also, an accessory and costume pack thingy, and the original 1994 arcade version of Killer Instinct, which has a lot of people more happy about the arcade version on their Xbox One than I think some people are about the new Killer Instinct.
4903561	4911029	If you think there's only eight characters in this game, you're full of crap, because they're gonna fuckin' put DLC out there, they're gonna make you buy those fuckin' characters.
4911069	4911310	Well...
4911890	4936870	I think yes and no I think it will be eight this year and then depending on how the game does because this is how they're talking they're saying well you will have the 2013 season that has these eight characters and the next year we can put along eight more characters and put that into the game I'm literally hearing and I'm trying to be open and understanding but what I'm literally hearing is we're making it up as we go along
4938058	4940038	8 characters in a fighting game seems kind of lame.
4940458	4947100	And the whole charging $5 for the characters is basically to get you to buy the $20 pack.
4947760	4951040	They never were intending for you to buy piecemeal characters.
4951080	4952701	They're just like, yeah, we'll put it there.
4952881	4954121	They want to be able to say it's free to play.
4954181	4958042	Well, we'll put it there so that people want to buy the $20 pack.
4958082	4959682	That's all it really comes down to.
4959742	4961662	And $20 for a fighting game is not a bad thing.
4962643	4964043	8 characters does seem quite...
4965184	4972012	low but that's the original Street Fighter 2 had eight characters and even then there were still four bosses on top of that
4973698	4980400	So, that's just the only, you know, and it's not that Street Fighter 2 was a bad game, it's just not 1991 anymore.
4981160	4994483	You know, and I did get a tweet earlier this week, and I apologize, I forgot the username of who sent it, but the tweet said, because I said, I was shading the fact that there was only the, you know, eight characters, and I got a tweet that said, what about quality over quantity?
4995984	5012666	and I was I never responded to it because I was mobile or something like that but honestly my answer to that is wait a minute though part of the reason that make fighting games so much fun is kind of the diversity of the roster and you look at the fighting games that come out today eight characters doesn't cut it anymore you know you gotta have
5013286	5014327	At least 15, 20.
5014787	5016269	How many did the new Mortal Kombat have?
5016629	5022074	Like, you know, you have a good diverse roster makes the game more fun.
5022194	5025416	Eight characters sounds like we rushed this game to get it out for the launch.
5026297	5031782	Like a lot of the other games that have been coming out launch for the platform seems like a lot of it's rushed.
5032362	5036566	And maybe, you know, pre-end more characters later on so they can sell it as DLC.
5036846	5041570	I think originally this game is probably going to be a retail release, but they just can't get it done in time.
5041690	5049782	That's what really concerns me, is that all these signs are pointing... You know, it's like these warning signs are popping up about this game, and it has me really concerned.
5050443	5052065	Well, I don't think it's just this game.
5052105	5056171	It's like Forza 5, for example, where it's shipping unfinished.
5056892	5057492	Come on.
5059393	5059713	So what?
5059733	5060874	It's day one patch, okay?
5060894	5061394	I understand that.
5061434	5068978	But, dude, you better hope that your servers are fucking working day one because there's going to be some pissed people.
5069158	5074000	Well, I guess not because there's still content in the game, but you're just not going to be able to play the full thing yet.
5074781	5075781	And here's the other thing.
5075801	5084385	I kind of don't trust Microsoft to keep it going, and I'm going to use my big old standby that I always bring up on the show and you're sick of hearing me talk about it.
5084405	5085406	Oh, well, there's two of them, remember?
5085766	5091930	Oh, well, the one I've got in my mind is remember when they said, we're going to bring a thousand games to game room.
5092670	5093511	And then what happened?
5093551	5096993	About 200 came out across 13 packs and they pulled the plug.
5097514	5099195	So those thousand games never happened.
5099575	5108821	So isn't it feasible that if Killer Instinct comes out and heaven forbid, it's not very good and people just aren't into it because there's not enough characters.
5109281	5111642	Do you think that 2014 pack will ever happen?
5111883	5111963	Nope.
5111983	5112063	Nope.
5112543	5112723	Grrrr.
5135123	5135443	Anyhow.
5135683	5139826	Or an actual legitimate use for the Xbox camera.
5139986	5143149	Weiland in our chatroom says, I'm waiting for PC Killer Instinct.
5144434	5145856	Is that something they said is going to happen?
5145876	5148338	Because I don't know if I would see that happening.
5149159	5153363	Probably not, just because they want everybody to purchase the Xbox One stuff.
5153383	5165416	I think maybe later on down the line when Windows 8 takes off and a lot more people have Windows 8 and that Windows Marketplace is more of a robust thing, then maybe you'll see stuff like that popping up there.
5165476	5165616	But...
5166457	5167178	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5182876	5191899	This character has the ability to throw spider webs to attack and ensnare opponents, and she has a pair of blades on the back of each hand and blades on her forearms and so forth.
5191999	5195940	Does not look like a previous Killer Instinct fighter, which is fine.
5196780	5208224	New fighting games in a franchise should have some new people, but I bet there's going to be some people that are a little irritated, like, alright, so there's going to be eight fighters...
5209764	5215188	And we're going to fill them all up with slots of people that are new and not like... Where's Orchid?
5215808	5216548	Where's Spinal?
5217349	5218830	Those are coming in the DLC pack.
5220491	5223373	The most popular character will be one of the two.
5223393	5228896	I bet you Orchid will be in there, but she'll be one of those characters that you can only get when you buy... You can't piecemeal her.
5228936	5230377	She'll be in that $20 combo pack.
5230877	5231718	You have to get her that way.
5231838	5232778	I bet you that's how it works.
5234059	5236360	This is pretty cool news, though, despite all this, you know...
5237801	5239923	Negative things we might be saying about Killer Instinct.
5240563	5241343	This is pretty neat.
5241904	5253811	Creative director Adam Isgreen and producer Torin Redding talking about Killer Instinct mentioned the original announcer, Chris Sutherland, will be selectable in lieu of the new announcer for Killer Instinct.
5254111	5259333	So if you want to have the old Killer Instinct experience when it comes to the announcer, you can do that.
5260213	5266275	I guess he did re-record some lines, and even though it's been 18 years later, sounds exactly the same.
5266355	5268916	So it sounds like he's aged a little better than DuckTales did.
5268936	5272657	Why didn't they just have him do it in the beginning?
5273117	5274777	Just have him be the guy.
5274797	5275858	That's a little weird, isn't it?
5276218	5281799	Because maybe what they didn't say, they said Chris Sutherland will be selectable in a $4.99 DLC pack.
5284661	5287224	$4.99.
5284721	5287224	Try $40 deals.
5287244	5287545	$40 packs.
5287565	5288566	For an announcer?
5288846	5289787	Yeah, no, I bet you.
5290528	5291970	$40 because you get the original game.
5292110	5293372	So you get the original announcer too.
5293852	5294693	Maybe, maybe.
5296275	5299038	But I wasn't... Well, Dota 2 sells these announcer packs.
5299178	5300380	It's part of the way they make money.
5300400	5301081	They're free to play.
5301681	5302062	Who knows?
5303683	5309765	TigerClaw in our chat pointing out that character I mentioned earlier, they can't call her Spider-Woman anyway.
5310105	5315567	I wasn't calling her that, but she looks like that type of character.
5315587	5322669	Dota 2 announcer packs, I saw the one for GLaDOS and one of the lines in there is it's Oda, the D is silent.
5328126	5328447	Wow.
5328587	5328967	All right.
5329608	5332072	Are we ready to get to the classic game of the week?
5332232	5336559	Back in the day, you didn't have to pay $5 per character.
5336679	5338983	You got all of it or you got nothing.
5339423	5342047	And that takes us to a segment we call the classic game of the week.
5344600	5362046	DarkSakura will dive into the gaming vault but not this week because she dived into her bed to rest tonight so I will dive into the gaming vault in her place and pick a game that you all should be playing this week sorry I'm laughing because Ranma in the chatroom says screw you Rob Roberts, DuckTales hater now wait a minute, wait a minute put the brakes on for a minute
5363271	5364332	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5385430	5397772	which is why I wish the sound production would have lended their talents better to that and two, I did not like that the cutscenes constantly interrupted the action all the time in what should be a very action based game that being said
5399454	5402157	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5416835	5431974	and one of the games I have on the back burner to talk about I wanted to share with you guys one of these days was a game available on the Commodore 64 because you know I'm going to use this opportunity to do a Commodore 64 game the game is called The Great Gianna Sisters is the game I picked tonight
5435939	5449227	Now, the great Giana Sisters, some of you have probably heard of this game because there's the Giana Sisters Twisted Dreams, which is an indie game that just came out on Steam Greenlight, and I think it's available on Xbox Arcade and PlayStation.
5449647	5452229	So yes, its roots are in this very old...
5452549	5453370	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
5471327	5487479	the Commodore 64 version was programmed by Armin Gessert and the graphics were done by Manfred Trenz and the soundtrack was composed by Chris Hulsbeck funny note, he came back later to do the soundtracks for these later games that came out there was also a DS game
5488079	5491562	Yeah, I played the DS game, and it was alright.
5513660	5515584	Most people know this game.
5515624	5520956	If you've heard of this game, you know it because it was a very controversial game when it came out on the Commodore 64 because...
5523027	5529370	It looked a lot like Super Mario Bros., down to the fact that they did the whole World 1-1 thing.
5529750	5530651	What do I mean by that?
5531151	5536074	Well, whenever a level creator comes out for a game, what's the first thing people usually make?
5537234	5543037	A penis, and then after that, World 1-1 from Super Mario Bros., right?
5543357	5543597	Yeah.
5543978	5547920	So, unfortunately, in the case of the Great Giana Sisters, World 1...
5549071	5551734	is pretty much World 1-1 from Super Mario Brothers.
5552154	5559222	So the first level is almost identical in layout to Super Mario Brothers, and the game itself shares some similarities too.
5559282	5572015	You pick up a magical pinwheel, it makes you bigger, and you have a little... You don't throw a fireball per se, but it's a bouncing ball, just like the Game Boy version of Super Mario Brothers.
5572515	5581082	But anyway, Nintendo pressured the makers of the Great Giana Sisters, threatening legal action if they do not take appropriate action.
5581362	5584005	The game was voluntarily withdrawn from sale.
5584105	5586687	No lawsuits or anything like that, but it was voluntarily withdrawn.
5587067	5589689	Therefore, it makes this game very rare.
5590350	5595174	Now, what they don't say about the controversy, and you don't know this unless you've played the game...
5595774	5599838	The later levels don't really look like Mario Brothers levels.
5599979	5607507	I would say maybe the second level has a little bit in common too, but I think there's 20 some odd levels in the game, and especially when you get into the later levels and some of the boss fights.
5608283	5609924	It isn't like Mario Bros.
5609964	5610604	in that regard.
5611104	5620647	But unfortunately, a lot of the basic game mechanics, you know, with the whole power-ups and getting coins and jumping on the coin blocks and so forth, that is all still pretty similar.
5620707	5625668	So it probably was in this company's best interest to take the game off the market.
5625749	5634731	But this is what makes this game such a cult classic and why people desire it is that, you know, it was, in a sense, a Super Mario-like game on a 1983 Commodore 64 and...
5637092	5651703	The soundtrack, the soundtrack, the soundtrack People love the soundtrack and rightfully so Great, great music available in the game So it's no wonder that they brought Chris Holspeck back to do the later games
5653705	5658428	Very well received, very highly rated in a lot of old Commodore 64 productions.
5658689	5661671	ZZap64 giving it 96%.
5662512	5669417	There are various ports out there, but the ZX Spectrum port that was planned was pulled back because of illegal pressures.
5670298	5672920	In 1993, the MSX version came out.
5673720	5678662	The game had been ported to Windows, DOS, Linux, but all unofficially.
5679943	5688966	Also a Nintendo DS version unofficially of the Commodore 64 port, not to be confused with the official sequel of Giana Sisters.
5689906	5693588	There was also a mobile version of the game made for Android phones in 2005.
5696674	5705181	There was a sequel planned for the game called Giana 2, Arthur and Martha in Future World, and it was supposed to have a futuristic setting.
5705541	5713567	But because of all the legal troubles, Time Warp renamed the game Hard and Heavy and changed the protagonist to Robots.
5713947	5719912	So if you've ever played the game Hard and Heavy, which came out on the Commodore 64 in 1989, that was inspired by Giana Sisters.
5719952	5721053	It was supposed to be the sequel.
5721973	5747906	um so Giana Sisters DS was an actual uh sequel that did come out in 2009 and then of course I think a lot of you know uh through Steam and so forth in July 2012 and the Kickstarter Giana Sisters Twisted Dreams became a reality so there you go the classic game of the week the Giana Sisters the great Giana Sisters yeah have you ever heard of this game in your life Loki
5748598	5750220	Yes, I have played it actually
5767402	5771806	TigerClaw on chat says, does that new Giana Sisters game poke fun at Nintendo despite them?
5771826	5772566	No, I don't think it does.
5772586	5773787	No, it's pretty badass, actually.
5774408	5781913	Yeah, and actually, yeah, the game doesn't play, I mean, the good thing is they turn this, it's still a platforming game, but it's way different now, and it is badass.
5781933	5790299	Like, you flip between the sisters, and it causes changes in the environment, and yeah, I've played through a bit of it on Steam, and it's a fun little game to play.
5790339	5796044	I think I talked about it on a previous episode of the show, but as far as a straight-up platformer goes, it's a lot of fun.
5797364	5800845	ShadowNextGen says, has Rob played the modern port of Gianna Sisters?
5801225	5801825	No, I haven't.
5802265	5805566	I've played the DS one, and I've played this new one, Twisted Sisters.
5805946	5812608	I did not even know until doing last-minute research for the article tonight that there was later ports that came on.
5813909	5816309	By the way, look at what she's fighting here in this video.
5816389	5817650	It's like a giant enemy crab.
5819531	5821292	This game was just ahead of its time.
5822752	5822992	All right.
5824273	5826134	The Great Gianna Sisters, classic game of the week.
5826634	5827075	How about that?
5827135	5829816	Did I do good with 15 minutes to pick a game?
5830336	5831357	All right.
5832298	5837060	Anyhow, we're going to take a quick break, and when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio, we got more news for you guys.
5837080	5838121	The Fugo Question of the Week.
5838461	5843204	I know our beginnings of the show was a little Sony-heavy, so we are going to talk about some of the goings-on in Microsoft's world.
5844184	5846446	Don't have a lot in Nintendo news this week.
5846846	5850149	That was more a couple weeks ago, but with their Nintendo Directs and so forth.
5850169	5853591	But we do have at least one big piece in Nintendo news coming up after the break.
5853611	5861057	And then, of course, most importantly, your calls, your emails, your voices when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5867284	5877046	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio, in progress with episode number 517 of our program, August 25th, 2013.
5878307	5882908	And of course, there is no show over Labor Day weekend, so this is a show that's going to have to hold you over for two weeks.
5883228	5886669	But the good news is, I just said it's episode 517, so if you're newer to the show...
5888069	5888810	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5912726	5913607	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5934679	5935520	It's really the only way.
5952910	5957693	Alright, so we are here to talk more news and get to the mailbag and all that fun stuff.
5958554	5960736	Let's do that right now with some rapid fire news.
5960836	5961096	Loki.
5961616	5969462	Alright, so this was kind of a surprise announcement out of the whole PlayStation 4 press conference that they had.
5969882	5978968	It was a reimagining of a game called Shadow of the Beast which was an old side-scroller, I guess, for the Amiga.
5979169	5980249	You know I know that game.
5980770	5982571	And so now it's this like
5983010	5989155	At first glance, you kind of go, oh, it's like Altered Beast, although no, but close enough, I guess.
5989395	5995740	Yes, and now it's coming to the PlayStation 4, so that's interesting, I guess.
5996561	5999323	Definitely not something you would guess would be coming.
6001064	6010792	Game Dev Tycoon is coming to Steam this week, actually, August 29th, and it will be getting an HD, well, sort of an HD, a
6011232	6012893	High-res treatment.
6013193	6016516	And if you haven't played Game Dev Story, it was a game on the iOS platform.
6017337	6018177	Fantastic.
6018237	6028405	You run a game development company, and you make games, and you make consoles, and it's one of those kind of management sims.
6028425	6030146	And it's a lot of fun.
6030526	6031627	So check it out.
6033531	6037275	Um, I'm sorry, I'm getting that confused, a game dev story.
6037415	6040798	I'm sorry, Game Dev Tycoon was the one that they offered up out there.
6040898	6042579	Unfortunately, there was a couple of them.
6042599	6043640	Yes, there was a couple, I'm sorry.
6043680	6046883	That was the one that- Because I took a look at that first thing, and I'm like, wait a second, that doesn't quite look like it.
6046903	6050606	No, no, that's the one they put up on Pirate Bay or whatever, and then- Yeah, that's right.
6050886	6056347	Ironically, your company would always go bankrupt due to piracy.
6056407	6058008	Yeah, that's right.
6058088	6058568	Never mind.
6058648	6059188	I'm sorry.
6059948	6060849	This game is coming out.
6060949	6063309	You should go play Game Dev Story if you haven't yet.
6063669	6064349	That's fantastic.
6064389	6066890	It's actually on iOS.
6066930	6068270	You can check that out.
6069271	6070551	If you want Game Dev Story, I guess.
6072190	6072530	I don't know.
6072591	6078197	After that kind of move that they're trying to teach people a lesson, I think I'll teach them a lesson by not buying their game.
6079318	6080359	Come on, it was funny.
6081540	6082882	I'm just not interested in it.
6083663	6084123	And then...
6086218	6087619	I mean, come on.
6088600	6106456	So Eurogamer kind of asked the question because it does beg to be asked since, you know, last year and wasn't very good because FIFA 13 on Vita and on the Wii
6106943	6108184	What's a reskin of FIFA 12?
6109425	6118533	So it begs the question, hey, guys, EA, are you going to be putting out an actual sequel to the game?
6118553	6122576	Are you going to just reskin the game from last year?
6123477	6127100	And so EA Sports came out with the best...
6128060	6128901	DarkSakura,
6154677	6173512	so literally roster update 2014 FIFA 14 is FIFA 13 which was FIFA 12 so fantastic that the game has not changed as people have hoped you don't have to worry about that happening in the Wii version or Wii U version because guess what it's not coming out they didn't make a version for the Wii or Wii U
6174232	6178814	Pro Evolution, now to be fair, Pro Evolution Soccer, same damn thing.
6178834	6179855	They did that on the Wii.
6180115	6186577	We do know that this year, though, that is not the case, at least with the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions, since those are using the Fox engine now and it's a completely different thing.
6187378	6191559	And I think actually the FIFA is using their new engine, the Ignite engine.
6193500	6202524	Going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com, Bobby Blackwolf, having played both GameDev games, wants you to know GameDev Tycoon is a lot deeper than GameDev Story.
6203365	6204465	A lot more difficult.
6205025	6213729	Blackwolf also is telling other chatters that he's going to make Podcast Network Tycoon, where you create a podcast network and have to deal with certain listeners.
6215350	6216391	I think you should make that game.
6216431	6217211	It'll be a lot of fun.
6219272	6244481	that's the next thing VOG needs to get into game development because you don't do enough programming Bobby let's take on another project come on love it all right um let's move on to some more rapid fire news uh I'll do a couple stories here one of them about Retro City Rampage on the 3ds I think we've talked before it is coming uh they're actually going to have it playable at PAX Prime but this is interesting you're not actually going to be able to play it in 3d at PAX Prime
6244981	6245742	So, okay.
6247043	6256614	However, this will be the latest version of Retro City Rampage that has the Retro Plus graphics mode that will double on-screen colors and add soft shadows to the game.
6257395	6259337	It is coming out on the 3DS eShop.
6260338	6262601	Is it going to be in 3D or is it just not the 3D version?
6263041	6283488	I think the 3D version is not actually playable at PAX that's what I'm gathering but yeah it sounds like it will be in 3D but I would imagine it's going to be pretty limited I mean when you see the retro games in 3D it's usually like one layer is this way and one layer I wouldn't expect but who knows it might exceed those expectations remember this is all one guy making this too
6284068	6285009	That's very impressive.
6286790	6304423	More information for Super Smash Bros., whatever the new one might be called, on the 3DS and the Wii U. A new screenshot has revealed that there will be a stage based off of Metroid Other M. It's the Pyrosphere from Metroid Other M, which is a pleasant surprise because, you know, I know a lot of us love Metroid.
6304803	6306204	Metroid Other M, on the other hand...
6306564	6306944	Thanks for watching!
6329058	6339681	Also of note for Smash Bros., Mashihiro Sakurai has noted that in the 3DS version of Smash Bros., you can actually have outlines around the characters.
6340101	6343102	And I believe this is to help them stand out on the smaller screen.
6343782	6344902	However, you don't have to do it.
6345563	6346723	The mention was that you can have 3D.
6346803	6350885	Thick outlines, thin outlines, or just turn them off.
6352446	6355427	Fans very interested in these when the pictures first came out.
6355767	6365132	The lines are there to help you see playable characters from the backgrounds and I would assume the various Pokemon that will show up and the other assists that happen in the fight.
6365432	6367313	It can get a little crazy on that tiny screen.
6368613	6369414	I think that's great news.
6370354	6386853	and I love I love it when a developer the more power they put in the hands of the player I mean not to you know use an old game cliche but the more customization that the player has to really make the game they want I say the better instead of saying we're going to do this we're going to put outlines and that's the way it's going to be deal with it
6387762	6388643	So, love that.
6389443	6391524	A brand new expansion revealed for Diablo 3.
6392005	6393626	We talked about earlier in the show Diablo 3.
6394246	6395647	Well, an expansion has been announced.
6395707	6397888	It's called Reaper of Souls.
6398529	6402651	It will have a new act in the game, five new levels, and the Crusader class.
6402691	6406193	It's a holy knight, very similar to the Paladin in Diablo 2.
6407454	6409035	Also, the loot system being overhauled.
6409055	6410556	They're going to call that Loot 2.0.
6411076	6412437	It has something called Smart Drop.
6412817	6414218	Paragon System No Paragon Level Cap
6437205	6437265	Hmm.
6452065	6454467	Alright, so a few announcements.
6454948	6456990	Once again, this is going back to some of the Sony stuff.
6457350	6461114	Gran Turismo 6 is now coming out on December 6th, so it's easy for you to remember.
6461634	6463035	And that would be on PlayStation 3.
6464196	6470502	And they're going to have the most cars on disc of any Gran Turismo game yet.
6471343	6476268	And I guess if you pre-order it some places, like the Evil G, you may get some additional cars.
6478207	6495216	and uh what I thought was interesting though they actually showed like a little bit of a trailer and stuff is that car companies are developing um prototype cars in Gran Turismo 6 like they're making some of their prototypes available to play as I thought that was kind of cool
6496116	6498898	That is a heck of a sign of the times, isn't it?
6498938	6503540	I'm not interested at all in Gran Turismo 6 because driving simulators, I'm just terrible at.
6503700	6504761	Arcade, fine.
6504861	6507282	Yeah, arcade, fine, but in the exact same way.
6508243	6509364	Mario Kart, loved it.
6509524	6510804	Blur was a great game.
6510985	6513086	Here's something I would love Sony to do.
6514146	6518409	Give me a Forza Horizon version of Gran Turismo.
6518609	6520150	Would be fantastic.
6520170	6522151	Forza Horizon was really good.
6523427	6524007	Give me something like that.
6524047	6526188	Maybe that's what DriveClub is.
6526268	6529309	I don't know what DriveClub is.
6529349	6532030	I don't know what DriveClub is either.
6532110	6534331	I don't know if it's more simulation or more arcade-y.
6534451	6537112	Give me an arcade version of Gran Turismo 6.
6537712	6541693	That would be pretty sweet.
6542753	6543253	That's coming.
6543494	6544074	December 6th.
6544454	6547935	So far, I might add, the only game announced for December is...
6550650	6575692	I still think Ubisoft is going to move South Park there and put in the Far Cry 3 it's just my own thought because last year they did it with Far Cry 3 and it worked out really well for them I thought they pushed the South Park game back to next year they kind of hinted that that could be a possibility because Matt Stone and Trey Parker kind of work on it on their own pace and you're not going to get them to hurry up so it's when it's done I guess fair enough
6576612	6577153	Um, alright.
6577553	6584018	And then, uh, Pokemon X and Y. Uh, the soundtrack will be coming out, and it's coming on four discs.
6584538	6585659	That's a lot of tracks.
6585859	6587200	212 tracks, to be exact.
6587481	6589002	Three and a half hours of music.
6589902	6594246	And it's available, I guess, um, on CDJapan for 2,500 yen.
6595787	6598589	And, um... So, yeah.
6598869	6600070	That's, uh, not bad.
6601591	6602252	And then, of course...
6604585	6626093	There hasn't really been any good Capcom fighting games, or I should say Street Fighter games, on the Wii U. Capcom's basically saying, nope, no Street Fighter on the Wii U. No plans to bring any of the games, no plans for Ultra to come there.
6628574	6629454	Maybe Street Fighter V?
6629474	6629895	No idea.
6631135	6645441	However, there will be some eShop versions of Street Fighter coming to the Wii U. Street Fighter 2, they're coming out with Street Fighter 2, Street Fighter 2 Turbo, Super Street Fighter 2 will be out on Virtual Console.
6646602	6647742	So those are going to be $7.99 each.
6651036	6657060	If you miss your fighting game that only has eight playable characters, at least you know this one's solid.
6657800	6658641	Classic Street Fighter.
6658981	6659141	Yeah.
6659481	6663584	Did they ever put out Killer Instinct on, uh... I don't believe they did.
6664064	6665625	But you know what I have sitting right over there?
6666065	6667026	A Super Nintendo.
6667386	6669487	And you see that black cartridge lying on top of that?
6669727	6670848	That can only be one thing.
6671709	6672809	So I'm not too worried.
6674910	6676451	Alright, I gotta thank Alan for that, though.
6676471	6678273	That's his Killer Instinct cartridge, not mine.
6678453	6678833	Alright.
6679235	6683398	Alright, let's get to the Fugle Question of the Week.
6683418	6686160	You take Facebook, you take Google, slam them together, you get Fugle.
6693757	6702503	Every week we ask a question of our Facebook community at facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio and our Google Plus page over at plus.google.com slash 110... No, I'm kidding.
6702783	6703844	Just search for Orange Lounge Radio.
6704364	6705345	All right.
6705625	6712010	Very simple question this week because most of the news this week, most of the heavy-hitting news was centered around Sony's big press conference.
6712350	6713150	We know the date.
6713410	6714291	We know the details.
6714591	6719014	We pretty much know all there is to know about PlayStation 4's launch at this point.
6719054	6720916	Maybe a few surprises at a Tokyo game show.
6721976	6722857	So what's the verdict?
6723397	6725279	I figure most people have made up their mind.
6725599	6727240	What's the verdict on the PlayStation 4?
6727560	6728421	Are you getting one?
6728881	6730422	Why or why not?
6731082	6742270	Let's start with an answer on Google Plus from Jamie Monn who says, I was already sold on the PlayStation 4, but the fact that they came out of the box with no shady online requirements and it's cheaper was a plus.
6742870	6747473	What they revealed this week wasn't anything to write home about, but didn't sway my opinion either way.
6747693	6750936	That being said, I plan on buying both systems at launch.
6752136	6752877	Lucky guy.
6753417	6754818	Lucky guy.
6754918	6759441	Black Dynamite says, Getting one absolutely day one no way.
6759961	6764444	Using the show's golden rule, a console is only as good as the games that are on it applies here.
6765025	6768567	Any worthwhile game, Grand Theft Auto V, Call of Duty, Final Fantasy, etc.
6768607	6769788	are coming out for current gen.
6770068	6773130	There's no real reason to get one unless you just want the latest and greatest.
6773410	6776672	Which I believe is an answer that echoes where Loki's head is at right now, right?
6779329	6785452	I still probably will get one, but Grand Theft Auto, man, we'll see.
6785612	6793917	That's kind of where I'm at, because I'm like, I still want one, and the gamer that has to have all the new toys wants one.
6794197	6803323	And yes, I love that you invoked the golden rule of gaming, and there's no games I'm dying for at launch, but I kind of want that console still.
6803383	6806024	You need to buy Grand Theft Auto V.
6808306	6810968	Seriously, you just need to do that.
6812069	6819995	Let me know what system Bobby's getting it on because at least I know I'm going to play against you and get killed, but I can play against Bobby and we're about evenly matched.
6820035	6821376	You don't play against me.
6821476	6822357	We're in a crew.
6822397	6824338	We go do heists.
6824519	6824859	Oh, okay.
6824879	6825659	So it's like Mass Effect.
6825679	6827801	We get a VOG crew together and we do heists.
6827821	6828862	So it's just like Mass Effect.
6829978	6831679	No, Mass Effect is lame.
6831739	6832120	I'm sorry.
6832140	6834241	You're supposed to say yes because that gets me to buy it.
6834641	6835242	All right, fine.
6835282	6836583	Yes, it's like Mass Effect.
6837083	6837443	All right.
6838124	6843427	Actdeft says, I'm going to wait to see where the consoles go and what games really do interest me on consoles.
6843487	6845629	For now, I'll stick to my PC and my 3DS.
6847470	6876024	Redertainment says no not because I don't want one but because project buy a house takes priority well real life sometimes does Techie Q says yes I will get a Playstation 4 at launch I need to trade in my 360 because it's gathering dust because I'm using my PS3 as my main console for gaming and video streaming the Evil G was offering 50% more in store credit towards a Playstation 4 in June oh boy all these incentives the Evil G is going to throw out there I'm just going to throw this out there as a word of advice
6877205	6877745	DarkSakura.com
6904520	6924733	SSJ100 Matt in chat says Grand Theft Auto 5 VOG game nights will be great yep yep that is definitely gonna happen and you're gonna be able to stream them I hope I will and then DarkSakura is in chat letting us still know her opinion she says I've revised my rule I have a new golden rule never buy a game system or an Apple product at launch
6926794	6927494	You're no fun.
6928355	6928955	No fun at all.
6929515	6930475	All right, let's go to Facebook.
6930495	6931735	Those are all our answers from Google+.
6931775	6932556	Let's do Facebook.
6933536	6935456	Holy moly, 18 comments on Facebook.
6935476	6937397	I'm going to try to do this relatively quick.
6937517	6938597	I apologize in advance.
6939077	6940337	I may not read all of these.
6940357	6942498	I'm going to try to pick out people I don't usually see.
6943278	6945919	Kurti K says, I won't be getting one this year.
6946359	6950840	I'm not looking forward to any of the launch titles, so I can wait until at least next year to pick up one.
6951780	6956542	Burr says, I'm getting one, but that's because I'm a consumer whore who has pre-ordered both systems.
6956943	6962345	However, I feel confident that the PlayStation 4 will be worth it just for whatever Naughty Dog develops for it.
6963365	6966367	Doug T says, I will be buying the PlayStation 4 day one.
6966747	6968808	I love my PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita.
6968908	6972710	I like Sony consoles better as they bring out more games that I like, such as RPGs.
6973470	6977512	Brian G says, I will wait until there's a compelling reason for me to buy one.
6977872	6982173	I have a gaming PC, and like Loki, Grand Theft Auto will keep me busy for a long time.
6983254	6989496	Loco Poco says, I'll be getting one day one, excited for Knack and Killzone, also because I'm a consumer whore.
6991697	7000461	Renee, one of our buddies from Koopa Club, says, I will not be getting a PS4 this year, not because I don't want it, but because I'm not ready to make that monetary investment just yet.
7001421	7003042	Jeremy J., also from Koopa Club, says,
7031281	7057437	and uh let's see a couple last answers here HitStun says slow down I don't even have a PlayStation 3 yet I still want to play Journey, Valkyria Chronicles, and Tokyo Jungle PlayStation 4 just doesn't have any games I could get hyped about and lastly Codeman says I canceled my pre-order I have a PC but I just don't have the funds nor do I really need one right now the only reason are games that have sold this to me is Kingdom Hearts 3 and Final Fantasy 15 I
7058297	7062080	Although they are developing Kingdom Hearts 3 on PC, so there might be a PC build.
7062560	7064422	I will wait just to let the dust settle.
7064982	7065503	And tacos.
7066744	7068505	Some of the answers there from Facebook.
7068545	7071907	I apologize I didn't read them all just because there were so many answers.
7072168	7076131	But I do encourage our listeners to check out the variety of answers available on Facebook.
7076491	7077452	Facebook.com slash questions.
7078272	7094369	Orange Lounge Radio and I did read them all on Google tonight because there's just less people over there but you can check out the full answers I did truncate some of the answers a little bit you can check that out on our Google Plus page thank you to everybody for responding let's get back into some more news Loki
7095670	7100853	Alright, so let's talk a little bit about the Xbox One.
7101194	7108038	Europe, they made an announcement that, hey, we're going to get you to buy the Xbox One because we know what you Europeans like.
7108578	7109479	You like FIFA.
7109839	7117123	So you get FIFA, you get FIFA, you get FIFA, you get FIFA, you get FIFA, everybody gets FIFA 14 with the Xbox One.
7119324	7120785	And the soundtrack's by Adele.
7121286	7123327	Go figure to try and get more sales.
7125000	7125661	It's a joke.
7127502	7129744	I got that.
7130324	7134708	So yes, it'll be also available on Xbox 360.
7134748	7136469	You can get a bundle as well for €199.
7136990	7138891	So yeah.
7140833	7143255	So FIFA.
7143735	7144075	FIFA 14.
7144335	7146177	That's how they're going to sell it to you.
7147452	7148793	Cool.
7150534	7152735	It's interesting that it's a third-party game.
7152835	7154035	That's the part that gets me.
7154656	7155796	I'm like, wow, it's a third-party.
7155896	7157357	I mean, it really does sweeten the deal, though.
7157697	7165381	I mean, with the fact that the console's $100 more expensive, it goes a long way to put a game in there to give that extra value.
7165522	7172225	I realize a game is only $60, but remember, Kinect and blah, blah, blah, blah, whether you like it or not, that is all stuff that's coming with it.
7172285	7175587	Which FIFA 14 does not, or I don't believe uses Kinect.
7176327	7179189	Well, I don't know if it uses Kinect because they don't say anymore.
7179309	7181510	A lot of the Xbox One games aren't right away.
7182150	7185172	There's some, but, you know, there's a lot that aren't.
7185912	7188153	At least if what we saw at E3 is to be any indication.
7188173	7195918	I mean, if they use it on the 360, let's assume that the features for the Kinect are going to be pretty similar on the Xbox One as they are on the Xbox 360.
7196938	7206226	So, the advantage that you get with the Xbox One is you paid $100 more for that stupid camera and they're going to penalize you for swearing at the game.
7207227	7209048	So, count me in.
7210289	7211830	Yeah, that's not going to work in my house.
7211890	7215613	Like, just the other night, actually one game I've been playing a lot of this week...
7216354	7217195	Bit Trip Runner 2.
7217896	7219277	I didn't talk about this in my gaming week.
7219417	7220658	Oh yeah, that's free, isn't it?
7220718	7222099	It's free on PlayStation Plus.
7222280	7227525	I bought it months ago on Wii U, but I was like, well shit, it's free and I want trophies.
7227765	7228726	So I'm going to play it again.
7229486	7234691	And every time I'm playing that game, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, fuck!
7236313	7237574	God damn it!
7239193	7240614	All the way back to the beginning of the level.
7244935	7246176	That's me playing Bit.Trip.
7248156	7251918	I don't need the Kinect penalizing me further for swearing.
7252218	7255539	Although a lot of that is obviously overdone.
7255619	7256019	Come on.
7256759	7261361	What Kinect games are really going to penalize you for swearing unless it's like Sesame Street Adventures?
7261501	7263602	They're going to card you in the game.
7264842	7265883	Or flag you, I guess.
7266303	7266503	Yeah.
7267243	7267604	I don't know.
7267684	7270166	It seems kind of lame that they have that as an option.
7270286	7275351	And that's the best you could come up with for Kinect is that.
7275851	7277953	And a lot of the stuff, yeah, that doesn't make any sense to me.
7277973	7279715	Well, in Europe, that's a huge deal.
7279775	7281157	That's like Mario Brothers.
7281197	7285360	No, I'm not knocking that, you know, they're bringing in... That's a big thing for... I'm talking about Kinect.
7285861	7291646	Like, what they're using it for is just like a lot of this voice recognition stuff that I think you could probably do just fine with...
7292387	7293028	A headset.
7293209	7302303	So I don't understand why they need a whole thing to watch you to do this voice stuff.
7302323	7302664	I don't know.
7304045	7306906	All right, well, some other big Microsoft news this week.
7306966	7313409	I'm sure many of you have heard that the current CEO of Microsoft, Steve Ballmer, no, Bill Gates is not CEO.
7313809	7316890	It's actually Steve Ballmer is the Microsoft CEO.
7317631	7320892	He will be retiring from that position over the next 12 months.
7321372	7322573	Don't know exactly when.
7322633	7326915	I would imagine a lot of that depends on when they figure out who is going to be replacing him.
7328015	7329476	And how well the Xbox One does.
7329496	7329816	Yeah.
7330516	7331717	I don't know about... First retirement.
7331757	7339379	The problem is people were already criticizing Steve Ballmer and it's not necessarily related to the Xbox One because like you said, it's not out yet.
7339419	7339960	Windows 8, yeah.
7340780	7342681	It's that and the tablets.
7343001	7343701	Windows Surface.
7343901	7347903	Yeah, the tablets, the phones, they haven't really been doing as well as they should have been.
7347983	7348483	So, yeah.
7349043	7355026	Unfortunately, you get a lot of that stuff, and the stockholders are saying maybe it's time for somebody else.
7355786	7358607	There is a panel put together to try and find a replacement.
7358667	7364570	Now, the panel includes Bill Gates, Chuck Nusky, Steven Luxo, also on that panel.
7366331	7373193	So yeah, if you're interested, just give Bill Gates a call and let him know you're interested in the position, although I kind of think they'll probably be looking at other...
7374614	7376295	Big companies, tech companies.
7377655	7380916	Here's where I insert my fan wank that they should hire Reggie Fils-Aimé.
7382637	7383277	Come on, guys.
7383737	7384798	How do you like that fan wank?
7386358	7390820	No, we're talking about, for one, Reggie's obviously a very game-focused company.
7390960	7395142	When we talk about the Microsoft CEO, that is much more than just Xbox.
7396922	7402084	Maybe they'll promote from within, kind of like how, you know, what they did when Don Mattrick left.
7402444	7403345	You know what they need to do.
7403605	7403765	Huh.
7405103	7416887	I know that this would probably violate some contracts and stuff, but they need to hire fictional character Kevin Butler as president of Microsoft because it would be awesome.
7419608	7426111	Is there anybody that jumps out at you who could be the person to jump in as CEO?
7426131	7426211	No.
7427603	7427843	No.
7428824	7430605	Well, you know what else they could... Clippy.
7431725	7432366	Clippy B?
7432486	7433366	No, not Clippy.
7433507	7436428	Oh, Clippy, the Microsoft Office Assistant.
7436868	7437089	Yes.
7437469	7442552	Well, you know what they could do in good old American tradition to find the new CEO of Microsoft?
7444613	7446034	Reality TV show.
7449115	7451457	This is Microsoft's Idol.
7452698	7453418	America Voted.
7456805	7457246	Anyhow.
7457746	7459067	Another show for Seacrest to host.
7459107	7459367	Come on.
7460427	7461147	He does need work.
7462108	7465449	No, he's going to be hosting an NBC game show coming up.
7465509	7466690	The Million Second Quiz.
7467230	7469751	Which is, and I know, oh God, I can't believe I'm going to admit this.
7470152	7471432	There's an app that's available.
7471452	7472232	That's a pretty long time.
7472553	7474213	There's an app that's available.
7474273	7474654	It's 11 days.
7474694	7475374	A million seconds.
7476014	7477517	Yeah, I know, that's a pretty long time.
7491517	7494698	when the guy won the million dollars and used his lifeline to call his dad.
7494978	7497158	Like that was like epic television, right?
7497178	7497358	Yeah.
7497598	7498418	It was event television.
7498438	7510481	That's why NBC's kind of trying to make that happen again because it's been a while since we've really had, you know, who wants to be a millionaire is kind of faded away into a, I shouldn't say faded away because now it's like a syndicated game show like your Jeopardy, like your Wheel of Fortune, you know, it's there.
7510861	7513782	But NBC's trying to make this event game show happen again.
7514182	7517902	And we've seen other networks try this like ABC had one a couple years ago called Duel.
7518243	7520443	It was a pretty decent game but it just didn't really take off.
7520703	7520923	Telephone.
7520943	7521223	Telephone.
7546641	7547922	Yeah, remember the telephone?
7548382	7550343	Okay, well now, what was that, 1999?
7550963	7553464	So here we are 14 years later, now it's an iPad app.
7553845	7568952	So you can actually download the Million Second Quiz iPad app, and I may be guilty of having played this, but you get matched up against other people, and you take a 10-question quiz, it's all multiple choice, and it's like a mixture of, like the same thing you would expect to see on Trivial Pursuit cards, right?
7569212	7570393	And you have to pick the answer.
7571053	7583664	Well, supposedly, and I don't know how this is going to work, but if you hit a certain benchmark score in the iPad app, you qualify as a line jumper to go beyond the real show when it debuts, I think, in a week or two.
7583684	7585606	I think it's coming up here pretty soon.
7585626	7586306	Yeah, I'm going to try it, I guess.
7586406	7586887	Yeah, right?
7586907	7593433	Because now when they say, oh, you might win money, like a million billion dollars or however much they're giving away.
7593453	7594433	I'll take a few thousand.
7594493	7594694	I'm not...
7595194	7609331	But that's how they make it event television by saying, you, Johnny America, sitting at home with your iPad, get the app now and you can be here sitting and winning all this money in a couple weeks or whatever.
7609831	7610312	Pretty good idea.
7612324	7616227	How did talking about Steve Ballmer leave us to talking about NBC game shows?
7616447	7621510	I don't know, but I agree with Codeman in the chatroom who says, at least it's not Candy Crush.
7622050	7622611	True facts.
7622671	7623871	Deleted that from my phone.
7623911	7624592	Thank you very much.
7624652	7625412	That was embarrassing.
7625592	7626413	Sorry about that.
7627233	7632217	I bet you anything there will be a Candy Crush-themed game show at some point.
7632237	7635279	Because wasn't there, like, a Hasbro-themed game show?
7635299	7636179	I think there still is.
7636199	7637480	There's still the Family Game Night.
7637520	7638521	Yeah, Family Game Night.
7641162	7644044	Actdeft in chat says, imagine if Rob gets on that game show.
7644164	7644784	Yes, please.
7645244	7653609	But it would also be nice if I won some money because then if I win enough money, I could possibly leave my day job and do VOG full time.
7653629	7654369	Wouldn't that be fun?
7655110	7656210	If I could win a million dollars?
7658290	7659512	Alright, forget it.
7660533	7661694	Moving on, more news.
7662394	7670402	Alright, so Humble Bundle, the Origin Bundle, has earned a record-breaking $8.7 million.
7670682	7677909	And that was based on 1.791 million bundles being sold.
7679030	7681272	And average price, $486 million.
7684000	7692849	and I guess the record previous to that was 5.1 million with the Humble Indie Bundle 5.
7694691	7696613	And they did add a few more games.
7696633	7708244	They added Command & Conquer Red Alert 3 Uprising, not Red Alert 3, which would have been an awesome game, but Red Alert 3 Uprising, a four-level standalone expansion.
7710613	7714218	Actdeft and ChatCorrecting, by the way, it's over 9 million now.
7715579	7717001	Oh, whatever.
7717221	7719423	Populous and... Yes.
7720565	7724289	And I think that was it.
7724909	7729333	I love the fact, by the way, even though Populous, you have to get it through Origin, whatever.
7729953	7734036	That's the classic game back from... When did that game come out?
7734336	7734036	1989?
7734376	7735377	It was on Super Nintendo.
7736898	7737678	That game was awesome.
7738639	7741181	I was very happy that they threw that in the bundle as well.
7741701	7746665	What's so funny about it is because the game is so old, Origin actually has these prompts that says...
7747425	7748506	and DarkSakura.com
7768363	7769364	You can quit the DOS.
7769524	7770204	I mean, DOS.
7770805	7772826	And then also, this is the funny thing.
7772906	7776708	Remember how games back in the day, the copy protection was the manual?
7777289	7779750	What is the third word on page 45 of the manual?
7779870	7781651	Or use this chart in the back of the manual.
7781711	7782832	So that was in Populous.
7782852	7784953	You had to identify these crests in the game.
7784993	7786014	So that's still in there.
7786574	7792458	But they fixed it so that it says you can input any word and the game will accept it as the correct answer.
7793178	7794780	So, like, what does this shield mean?
7795100	7795541	Boobs.
7795921	7796522	And it'll take it.
7796702	7797443	That's correct!
7798964	7799665	Sweet.
7799745	7800306	There you go.
7802441	7802721	All right.
7803722	7804022	All right.
7804322	7806303	And then something else about Origin.
7807084	7808805	They're now allowing returns.
7808965	7811266	Now, returns with an asterisk.
7811907	7830858	Basically, what's going to happen is if you buy a game on Origin and they have this now great game guarantee, if you're unsatisfied with your full game digital download from Origin, and this includes full games on pre-order and other discounts and stuff,
7831398	7850295	I believe you'll be able to return it within 7 days so 7 days after purchase without activation or 24 hours after launching it for the first time so 24 hours if you've activated 7 days if you haven't activated the game
7851992	7860817	Interesting to see Origin and EA really making these big customer service grabs between the Humble Bundle and the great thing they're doing for charity.
7860897	7866041	And I hate to make that sound opportunistic, but the reality is it's... It was opportunistic.
7866321	7870403	Well, it's putting a lot of people in Origin's good graces right now.
7871084	7877508	And now this, which is hard to say this isn't good news because I think it's great news.
7877548	7877908	It isn't.
7878908	7879689	It isn't terrible.
7879949	7880690	It's not bad news.
7880950	7881490	It's good news.
7882831	7884492	It's good that they have that option in there.
7886753	7889855	And it's good for a few reasons.
7890095	7896880	One, if you run into a situation like SimCity where the whole launch was fucked up, you can get your money back, which is kind of cool.
7897420	7904004	Or, for example, if you buy a game that just doesn't run well on your PC, then you can get your money back.
7904024	7904485	That's huge.
7904505	7905325	So that's pretty good.
7905565	7906646	Or you just don't like it.
7906846	7935019	yeah or you just don't like it so I think that's kind of cool that they have that in there I wish Steam would do something similar but let's be honest here this is far and away from like you know I'm selling a used copy of my game that I finished or something like that this is not anything like that this is just kind of like that almost like the Evil G used game thing where it's like okay within seven days you can return this you know except you know seven days without playing it um
7936604	7939265	So I'll give them props for at least having some sort of return.
7940325	7948527	Well, you said in passing, you said, I wish Steam would do something like this because, yeah, they don't really do refunds on Steam unless there's a huge... I mean, they've done it before, but it was like a huge thing.
7948967	7957949	But this whole competition now, you know, if Origin does get more and more market share, it's going to force Steam to look into doing these types of things.
7960430	7961910	to make themselves competitive.
7961970	7962590	It's interesting.
7962730	7971593	I don't know if they'll have to do that because I think what's going to end up happening is they're probably going to come out with some sort of way to sell or trade your game online using their services.
7971633	7978736	I think that's what's going to end up happening there so they may not have the whole returns thing.
7980467	7982789	So I think this is a good direction.
7982869	7988994	I mean, I can't say I'm going to go buy a bunch of games and then return them, but it does take that awkwardness out of returning things too.
7989174	7989735	Like, I don't know.
7990075	7996420	I just don't like to go back to the store and return something because I feel like that guy, unless it's like very clearly broken or whatever.
7996520	7998382	Like I just, who likes to be that guy?
7998942	8001344	Well, some people do, but anyway.
8001364	8002105	Okay.
8002605	8006289	Well, you can be any guy or gal you want to be in a series known as Fable.
8006910	8009613	And Fable Legends is a new game.
8010454	8014478	It's a multiplayer game that's set in the universe of the other Fable games, Albion.
8015239	8016940	It was announced at Gamescom.
8017221	8020444	There will be a beta test actually happening next year.
8020604	8022006	So not to be outdone by...
8022706	8024787	Say Elder Scrolls Online on the PlayStation.
8025467	8026908	Xbox will have Fable Legends.
8028068	8032870	No release window for the game currently, but I would imagine if they're going to beta test it next year.
8033051	8034431	No later than holiday next year.
8034451	8035912	Holiday next year would be my guess.
8036152	8039053	You can sign up on the game's website if you're interested in more information.
8039153	8043855	FableLegends.com There's a little trailer and you can see all the other stuff they put out at Gamescom.
8043875	8045276	It looked neat, but I'm sorry.
8045496	8050318	After playing the last few Fable games, it's always so much hype and then they play...
8050638	8077795	especially if they have Peter Molyneux talking about Fable oh my god you know they just hype it up so much and it's just kind of like yeah this is kind of very similar to the last Fable game um so I don't know it looks all right but I mean it'd be something my wife would be into I'm not buying it she loved the Fable games didn't I'm not buying an Xbox one for that game but you know my wife would probably be interested I forgot she really liked the Fable games huh yeah she plays through because she like what did she like to do really weird things in them didn't she
8079795	8080636	I thought that's what it was.
8081357	8082779	Does she play them good or evil?
8083239	8084100	Good, usually.
8084421	8085022	She tries to.
8085502	8086283	That's good.
8087645	8095655	Alright, well let's see if our emailers this week are good or evil in a segment we do every week here on the show called The Mailbag.
8096778	8101421	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send us emails each and every week.
8102281	8106824	And in the absence of DarkSakura tonight, I will dive in the mailbag head first.
8107885	8110367	And oh my gosh, it's pretty empty in here.
8111192	8118956	But at the very, very, very bottom of this mailbag, way down there at the bottom, one email here for me to read tonight.
8119097	8119477	One email.
8119797	8120217	Well, you know what?
8120257	8122759	It's kind of a long email, so it'll work.
8123159	8125440	If you want to email us for a future week, you know what?
8125500	8129382	When DarkSakura gets back and she's over her allergies and all that, let's make her work.
8129943	8131544	Give us like 10 emails for next week.
8131784	8136847	If you can send 10 emails from 10 different people, I will get DarkSakura a taco.
8138007	8138648	Remember that bet?
8140549	8142250	Ragenator is our emailer tonight.
8142270	8142770	Here we go.
8143831	8147212	I think that we all in the VOG community have at least one thing in common.
8147292	8148273	We're all gamers.
8149894	8152115	I'm going to actually stop you right there.
8154131	8156313	VOG is actually the voice of Geeks Network.
8156714	8166805	Now, I think most of the people do play some games, but certainly not every show on VOG is about games.
8167847	8172452	And I think we do have a couple hosts who maybe don't play nearly as many video games as the rest of us do.
8172572	8172953	So please...
8173433	8181421	Please do make that a note, even though OLR, Bobby Blackwolf, Girls Gone Wow, you know, we're all strictly about video games.
8181982	8184605	Under Station Live dabbles in it, PodCulture dabbles in it.
8185786	8187588	They are not strictly video games.
8188228	8193454	But anyhow, I think you would be right in saying gaming is one big part of geek culture.
8194314	8194555	Anyhow.
8195563	8196203	He goes on to say,
8225117	8225838	Thank you for watching!
8240188	8241349	Call of Duty, Madden, Mortal Kombat
8256820	8257521	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
8277122	8277843	Thank you for watching!
8295638	8298959	This email has been brought to you by Bobby's googly-eyed Oculus Rift.
8299359	8302640	Now if only DarkSakura can get him to use the damn thing to play Mass Effect.
8302960	8304140	Garrus all the things.
8304901	8307201	That email again from Ragenator.
8309702	8312403	So the question from Ragenator, why gaming?
8313023	8314543	I'll ask Loki here in a minute here.
8314923	8317924	Let me read some of the answers from... No, no, let me go to Loki, actually.
8318324	8319344	Loki, why gaming?
8319925	8320245	I don't know.
8320265	8320725	I'm just...
8322445	8323626	Why do you play video games?
8324686	8326246	Because they're fun.
8326306	8329127	It's just a medium, I guess, to play.
8329327	8335169	I mean, it's just like if you were to play with Legos or if you were to draw or you're going to do something else.
8335249	8337590	I mean, just, I don't know.
8337610	8338830	It's just what I ended up doing.
8339010	8343692	You know, it's what I started off early with, like, you know, PC games and stuff.
8344072	8347593	And, you know, I did other things other than just, you know,
8349289	8350371	Thanks for watching!
8365593	8366214	All sorts of stuff.
8366274	8369417	And for some reason, it's just something that we do nowadays.
8369477	8370779	It's like, why watch TV?
8370939	8372000	Why listen to the radio?
8372020	8376965	I mean, it's to the point now where video games are kind of like watching TV.
8377045	8377886	It's that common.
8377946	8380628	It's not really... It's like, why eat food?
8380689	8380929	I mean...
8381249	8382730	That was a little bit me too.
8383090	8387931	If you go back to my senior year of high school and you look at me in the yearbook, I'm in six different clubs.
8388632	8389592	And that doesn't even count.
8389692	8391653	I used to do a public access TV show.
8391673	8397735	A lot of people don't know about this because I don't want Travis Donovan ever finding the tapes of it because God knows what will happen.
8398815	8401796	But I was doing all this stuff when I was a kid.
8401836	8403397	And I think a lot of that was just because...
8404637	8410461	I don't know if it was out of boredom or just out of the fact like, you know, when I was sitting at home doing nothing, I just felt really depressed.
8410961	8414264	So I had to kind of get out and do these different things, and I just almost overdid it.
8414564	8418326	And video games, to some extension, were a real social thing at that age.
8419127	8426011	I think the reason why I got into it, to answer the question, actually very similar to what Raginator said at the beginning there.
8426272	8433737	Being able to kind of control the pictures on the TV I think was a real kind of novel thing when you're like six years old, five years old, and very impressionable.
8435419	8445016	I'm going to the chat room and some of the answers there let's see Brad from PogCulture says why not gaming?
8447033	8451455	Black Wolf says, I don't do underwater basket weaving because I don't have a pool.
8453176	8454416	There is no place to practice.
8455616	8457857	But a game console is cheaper than a backyard pool.
8459978	8461699	Degenerate Johnny says, why gaming?
8461739	8464740	Because it makes me harder than Peter North in a Bukkake festival.
8464940	8465240	What?
8466461	8466721	What?
8468476	8470118	Where every gamer has a voice, I guess.
8470999	8476485	SSJ100Matt with a far more serious answer saying, Escapism is the thing for some people.
8477206	8477587	Certainly.
8478167	8484455	Well, DarkSakura is still listening to the show, and she sent an answer over private message here, because if she were here, I'd ask her what she says.
8484495	8488360	So she told me over chat, she says, I had a rotten childhood, and I would hide in books.
8488820	8489280	Thank you for watching!
8509640	8522295	as far as why I like it over another medium it's that again that process of immersion having an active hand in what happens in the game makes it a lot better than being a passive participant so there you go
8524614	8533781	Yeah, I think, you know, I use this kind of example today as like some of my friends ask me like, wow, you play a lot of World of Warcraft.
8533842	8534742	Aren't you addicted?
8534822	8536484	Are you addicted to World of Warcraft?
8536504	8539726	And then I go, well, how have you spent your free time?
8539806	8542789	You've watched every single episode of Lost twice.
8543249	8543990	Are you addicted?
8544150	8545271	Are you addicted to Lost?
8545671	8546392	Game of Thrones?
8546432	8547372	Are you addicted to that?
8547553	8551456	TV tells me that you're addicted to, wow, because you can't just like it.
8551496	8552517	You must be addicted.
8553277	8554018	TV, TV.
8554378	8582643	so yeah it's like yeah I may play a lot of video games but if you ask me like what movies I've seen lately I see maybe 10% of what I really want to see I saw the first half of Plains yesterday and you asked me about TV shows I'm especially clueless the fact that I watched Orange is the New Black from start to finish says a lot about that show because there's very few shows I've watched from start to finish very few so there you go
8584864	8585445	Alright, that's it.
8585625	8586667	That was the only email tonight.
8586727	8592176	So mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com if you would like to send us an email for a future week.
8592917	8596002	In the meantime, let's get to the FUs of the week.
8596322	8598466	And this is the part of the show where we give our angst.
8614828	8617511	Um, well, Loki, would you like to start us off tonight?
8617811	8625037	Yes, uh, big fuck you to Cyclist, because you're always in my goddamn way on the street.
8625157	8633244	There's this guy that was in front of me today, you know, not on a bike lane or anything, just kind of in the middle of the goddamn street, riding his bike super goddamn slow.
8633844	8641851	I didn't go around him, because if I go try to, you know, share the lane with him and go around him, then I might hit him, and that would be bad, so...
8643152	8644252	Yeah, fuck that.
8644813	8646773	And also, what is up with all these people?
8647173	8658117	I know that you're not on a fucking team practicing for the race, but wearing your stupid, like, skin-tight, you know, uniforms with all your sponsors on there.
8658437	8659697	I'm sorry, but no.
8660077	8661738	Fat dude wearing that.
8662078	8663238	You do not have sponsors.
8663278	8664119	You're not in a race.
8664139	8665459	You're not practicing for a race.
8665679	8666519	I don't understand it.
8666760	8667880	My boss has, like...
8668380	8694013	a group of people that he rides with and they all have like jean uniforms and stuff it's ridiculous you're not in races okay you don't have sponsors what the hell all right uh DarkSakura sending her FUs uh by private messages she wants you all to know FU to my fucking sinuses which makes sense uh and 115 school books for one fucking class oh my god a lot of money um
8694153	8700757	My FU of the week goes to construction on Highway 80 between Vacaville and Dixon.
8701137	8702117	You suck.
8702458	8707880	And I realize, look, construction workers don't hard... Construction workers work hard.
8708261	8709942	I don't blame you personally.
8710362	8715565	I know you have to do that stuff, but here's the thing that pissed me off about it is that there was no warning.
8715665	8721988	If you know traffic is going to be backed up at 1.30 in the morning for one hour, have
8722088	8723528	Thanks for watching!
8745595	8751019	I would have sympathy if they chose to show an abducted child message over a construction message.
8751039	8751880	I'd be okay with that.
8752080	8758204	But to show nothing at all that warns me, hey, try taking a back road is a little bit irritating.
8758224	8763448	You didn't know that this month is California Repave the Road Month.
8763628	8765330	It's Spare the Air Day tomorrow.
8765430	8767131	God, Spare the Air Day!
8767271	8768011	Spare the Air!
8771303	8771603	Anyhow.
8772664	8775146	Or click it or tick it.
8775766	8779089	What else do they put on those Amber Alert signs that have nothing to do with their purpose?
8779689	8780590	Report drunk drivers.
8780670	8781751	Report drunk drivers.
8781791	8782751	Well, it's some of the...
8783900	8799248	A lot of this stuff is important, and I'm not trying to belittle it, but I sometimes feel like when they do this, it's like when the text message... Remember when they sent the Amber Alert text message to everybody at 2 in the morning about the kid that got kidnapped?
8800008	8802049	Tons of people disabled it right after that.
8802169	8803090	Why did they do that?
8803530	8807392	Are they assholes that don't care about kids?
8808112	8813295	No, it's because that hideous thing showed up on people's phones at 2 in the morning going...
8813935	8814095	Anyhow.
8840211	8840932	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
8859105	8860146	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8876144	8880328	And then at the end of the trailer, also announced the bundle that was going to be coming out.
8881228	8884051	And thankfully, there are some people that took screen caps.
8884571	8886273	And what is this new bundle going to have in it?
8886293	8899924	Well, it's basically a Wii U, black Wii U system with the gamepad having what looks like a decal on it with some, you know, the Zelda, like, flourishes and stuff.
8899944	8901246	There's, like, some little bit of gold...
8904401	8904841	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
8928213	8929574	That's kind of a hard sell.
8929794	8938359	Also, when other systems like the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3 are $199, that's a lot of games you can buy in between that.
8938779	8942481	Granted, it's not Zelda, but this is not technically a new Zelda either.
8942661	8954007	It is an HD remake that you're trying to convince people to buy a system for a brand new Zelda, which it's not.
8955205	8960212	I'm sure they'll announce said brand new Zelda next year, but there's still a lot of ways to go from there, right?
8960232	8965420	If you put a demo for brand new Zelda on that disc, then you're talking.
8965820	8966802	Yeah, that's true.
8966962	8968344	Then those things will go flying.
8970186	8970507	Alright.
8971488	8974250	Well, unfortunately, some sad news to end on tonight.
8975511	8978253	And that has to do with a studio closure.
8979174	8983937	Seattle-based studio Big Fish has gone through a round of layoffs.
8984338	8992604	It is closing its Vancouver studio and has gone into a 30-day consultation period about its Cork, Ireland operations.
8993604	8997085	CEO Paul Thelen sent a letter to staff that talked about the changes.
8997425	9004127	They talked about 49 layoffs in its Seattle headquarters and another 70 employees realigned.
9004768	9007088	524 full-time employees in Seattle previously.
9007729	9008989	9% of the studio cut.
9009869	9020934	I want to stress that our decisions are not based on company-wide performance or that of the people working on these initiatives, both of which are strong, but because of where the market is growing and, quite frankly, where it is not.
9021395	9026577	The most significant decision we are making today is that we are discontinuing our premium cloud delivery business.
9027057	9032342	This service is not growing as fast as we had hoped it would and is not on a path to profitability.
9043032	9043993	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9062597	9063757	Thank you for watching.
9063817	9064738	See you next time.
9080683	9082124	That does it for news tonight.
9082445	9083886	We're going to open up the Skype line.
9084286	9086989	It is time for us to open up the Skype line and get some calls.
9088030	9097117	Our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, or you can still call us on the good old telephone, 1-877-GAME-OLR is where you can call us.
9098358	9100739	Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.
9101059	9104600	Speaking of calls, there's this weird new thing happening on Skype.
9104640	9107381	I don't know if I should talk about it, but I think we're getting spam voicemails.
9108182	9115904	I seriously had seven voicemails throughout the week from random numbers, but I would try to click play because I thought, oh, maybe somebody's actually leaving us a bumper.
9115965	9117265	Maybe it's actually a new listener.
9117525	9119066	But I click play and nothing happens.
9119126	9122587	And then I go, all the voicemails are the same length.
9122907	9124568	They're all four minutes and 22 seconds.
9124608	9125048	And I'm like,
9125848	9147504	that's probably spam probably tell me to go to some website and put in my social security number for a chance at some credit card or something lame alright well somebody's calling in on the phone right now so let's see what happens when we pick up the phone and go do it hi you're on Orange Launch Radio who's this hey it's Jim Sally guy hey Jim Sally what's up buddy
9148675	9152597	I totally forgot you guys have an old school telephone man sitting on your show.
9152757	9154818	We do have the old school telephone sitting on the show.
9154838	9158340	That's why I was surprised to hear from you on it because usually you call us on Skype.
9158580	9160641	Were you just wanting to test that it still worked?
9162822	9166884	No, I'm outside in my garage and the Skype lady was saying she didn't like my Skype.
9167344	9168345	Oh, I'm sorry about that.
9168585	9171386	I don't want to call you and be all choppy on the Skype line.
9172347	9174708	So Jim Sally, to what do we owe this phone call tonight?
9175869	9178210	I was going to give my own little fuck you of the day today.
9178735	9178975	Go for it.
9178995	9179275	Go for it.
9206280	9212504	It said I'd have a fucking paid subscription if I wanted to use goddamn Internet Explorer on my Microsoft machine.
9212764	9215565	Yep, you want to use any of that premium shit.
9215705	9217406	It's behind the freaking paywall.
9218447	9220788	Why didn't the fucking Internet Explorer premium?
9220848	9222549	It's the shittiest browser out there.
9224070	9226331	They should apologize to me when I turn it on.
9226511	9228793	If I make me pay for it.
9229233	9231074	And then I went to go to YouTube.
9231154	9231514	It's okay.
9233379	9236341	Fuckin' Sesame Street videos and motherfuckin' YouTube don't work.
9236641	9239162	It's okay, they make up for it by letting you use Bing.
9241143	9242804	Oh my fucking god.
9242864	9243664	Bing doesn't work either.
9243685	9246346	You go to Bing and you search something and it says you gotta pay for shit.
9246646	9248187	You go and look for what's on your Xbox.
9249482	9250823	You know, that would be nice.
9251203	9254064	They should allow you to set your... Maybe we should do this.
9254124	9260707	Set up some type of website on OrangeLaunchRadio.com that you could set your home browser to in Internet Explorer on Xbox.
9260727	9266850	That way, every time you open the browser, it would take you to a page that says, Welcome to Internet Explorer 10 on the Xbox.
9267090	9267891	We're very sorry.
9271581	9273942	What else doesn't work that I'm going to find out now?
9289727	9291108	The X button on the fucking controller?
9291128	9291648	Maybe that doesn't work.
9291668	9292129	Netflix doesn't work?
9292149	9292949	If I pay for Netflix, it doesn't work?
9292969	9293190	Fuck, man.
9293210	9294651	They can go suck a dick.
9314298	9320162	Thank you Microsoft for making my decision to buy a Playstation 3 so much fucking easier
9338459	9346765	You know, I was considering buying an Xbox One for the pass-through, because I do use the Xbox to communicate with people, but fuck, I bet you my Messenger doesn't work anymore now.
9346805	9350929	I bet you my Amazon Messenger doesn't work anymore on my fucking Xbox.
9350969	9351489	Fuck Xbox, man!
9354201	9355301	Fuck Xbox, everybody.
9355321	9355942	Don't buy one.
9356462	9359363	Just always put the Kylo on this shit.
9359763	9360444	Buy an iPad.
9360464	9361224	The game's free.
9361244	9362024	It's fucking better.
9362464	9383773	You know the one thing I'm kind of sad about with these new systems is that they don't have... They only have HDMI out, and they don't have options for... I understand, like, component and stuff, you know, would have been nice, but, like, I play a lot on a PC monitor that has just a VGA in, and I'm sure there's a cable I could get, but it's going to be an elaborate setup just to play
9384493	9385554	on a VGA monitor.
9385734	9392560	I really wish they'd have that so I could use a VGA cable like they had with the Xbox 360, because I get a lot of use out of that.
9395763	9396443	Yeah, I agree.
9396483	9398485	The Xbox One, whatever.
9398705	9399586	Everyone forget about it.
9399846	9401547	Just buy a PlayStation 4.
9401928	9403349	It's not just the Xbox One.
9403409	9405070	PlayStation 4 or 2 does the same thing.
9405451	9409454	It kind of sucks, because there's only really one TV I can play that on.
9410335	9412997	Or I'd do PC monitor, which I really don't want to.
9414045	9414826	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9436920	9441664	So I'd really encourage, you know, those looking for podcasting tips or whatever, take a look on the forums.
9441764	9444486	But is this something that might happen, Jim Sally?
9444526	9446828	We looking at a Jim Sally show coming soon?
9447108	9447689	We are, man.
9447729	9449630	We're doing a little experimentation episode.
9449650	9456296	It's not going to be... I always thought I'd have to do a video game show, but even Bobby says don't even worry about video game shows on the VOG Network.
9456676	9458057	He wants lots of other stuff.
9458738	9465363	So we're going to do a... It's called Jim Sally's Macho Man, where Jim Sally teaches geeks how to be macho men.
9466412	9467514	A lot of us are too geeky.
9468054	9470197	We don't know how to do things like drive a fucking stick.
9472901	9480312	I have my friends that can drive a stick in Gran Turismo all day long, and then they get into my little Porsche and they can't back it out of my driveway.
9481154	9482496	I kind of love this idea.
9482556	9487019	As long as it stays on that line of being tongue-in-cheek and not insulting, but I know you can do it.
9487160	9488300	I know you can do it, Jim Sally.
9488320	9489061	I think it would be funny.
9489081	9493405	Well, a little bit insulting, because you should macho up, but then obviously teach the person how to do something.
9494446	9494686	All right.
9495006	9500531	Jim Sally, I'm going to let you go so we can get more calls, but it's always a delight to hear from you, and look forward to your new show soon.
9501758	9503800	Alright everybody, stay tuned for more.
9503840	9504741	Good night everybody.
9504821	9505682	Alright, night Jim Sally.
9505722	9506943	Good night.
9506983	9510586	Do you want to send Jamie a special message?
9511687	9513769	Jamie, I want to send you a special message right now.
9513909	9516151	Right now I'm snuggling my pillow and I'm sending it to you.
9516656	9521539	I'm just squeezing the sinuses juice right out of you.
9521619	9523120	Oh, gushing out of your nose.
9523660	9525061	Oh, can you feel it?
9525581	9527562	Oh, yeah, Jamie, that's for you, baby.
9527602	9532565	Jim Sally, I'm going to leave you to your pillow, Jim Sally.
9532585	9533646	Good night, Jim Sally.
9533666	9533746	Bye.
9545753	9547696	That wasn't creepy or anything.
9550301	9554329	Jamie's in chat right now going, ew, the snot is everywhere now.
9557769	9566336	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call.
9567437	9569559	Loki, do you have any last minute stories?
9570019	9574463	Yeah, I was going to talk about the release of a homebrew game for the Nintendo DS.
9575744	9581909	It's called Aperture Science DS and as you might imagine, it is a DS version of Portal.
9582709	9599722	and you can download it for free on smelium.net it's S-M-E-A-L-U-M dot net slash A-S-D-S Aperture Science DS so check that out it looks pretty impressive actually for a DS game
9600342	9601523	For homebrew, I guess, too.
9601563	9602983	Yeah, it's pretty impressive.
9605465	9605845	Let's see.
9606065	9608727	Also, the GamePop.
9608927	9609487	Remember them?
9609947	9613109	They're one of those Android consoles that we kind of forgot about.
9613469	9617771	But GamePop was the one that had the monthly service that you would subscribe to, I guess.
9619452	9626356	And they've actually announced some partnerships with different mobile game developers, including TinyCo, who does Tiny Village.
9627236	9652394	uh, Animaca, I guess Pretty Pet Salon, and Creative Mobile, which does the drag racing franchise, also, uh, Halfbrick with, you know, the Jetpack Joyride guys, uh, Vector Unit, who do Riptide GP, and Glue, Heroes of Destiny, and they're saying that they're gonna have about 500 games available when the GamePop launches in winter, and, uh,
9653874	9658676	Yeah, so it's going to be, I think if I remember correctly, it's like a streaming model.
9659097	9672083	So you would be able to get a free mini model that requires a $6.99 monthly subscription or the more powerful model of the console, which is $129, but the subscription service is still required.
9672823	9682910	and then also GamePop games I guess can be played with a smartphone as well instead of just the controller if you really want to.
9683251	9690096	Although why the hell would you buy a gaming console to play on your phone when you can just play these games on your phone to begin with?
9690316	9694138	Well, sometimes with the Wii U you're going to play on the tablet.
9694178	9695299	But remember it's not all a card.
9695339	9697501	It's $6.99 and you get access to 500 games so there's that too.
9697521	9697661	Yeah.
9702037	9702377	All right.
9702978	9705839	Let me give another call for the Skype line if you want to give us a call.
9706439	9708000	Boy, Bobby didn't get any calls tonight either.
9708020	9708780	Everybody's shy tonight.
9708800	9712943	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
9712963	9714243	At least we got Jim Sally.
9714283	9717805	If nothing else, God bless Jim Sally.
9717825	9722007	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
9722387	9724348	In the meantime, I want to get to Twitter topics here.
9725689	9727830	Trying to bring it up on my iPad right now.
9728330	9730851	Except I had the Rocky Horror Picture Show up on my iPad.
9733113	9735915	Alright, just a couple tweets tonight from Tigerclaw.
9736636	9738017	Tigerclaw sending us a couple tweets.
9738377	9743601	One of them, a Metroid fan film Kickstarter taken down over IP dispute with Nintendo.
9743961	9746043	Does this surprise anybody?
9746103	9746303	Nope.
9746784	9749446	I'm surprised somebody thought they could get away with it.
9750066	9753528	Hey guys, it's Degenerate Johnny Hey Degenerate Johnny, how you doing buddy?
9776300	9776861	You know, I'm bad.
9776901	9777622	Can't complain.
9778323	9778824	Good to hear from you.
9778844	9779985	I want to apologize.
9780005	9783350	I kind of missed most of last week's show.
9784344	9786966	I was over at Gen Con last week.
9787486	9787946	That's okay.
9788046	9791208	I understood you sent in an email to the show and we somehow missed it.
9791328	9799612	We didn't purposely omit it, but I worry that we get a lot of spam at our email address and it might have been accidentally thrown in.
9799633	9801033	Oh yeah, I totally understand that.
9801854	9804555	I just wanted to call people's attention to the VOG Network forums.
9804575	9809538	You posted your poem that you'd written there and it was brilliant, so I just want to make sure people see it.
9810979	9812520	Okay, alright, I appreciate it.
9812660	9813020	No worries.
9814798	9815318	So what's up?
9815838	9816099	Okay.
9816639	9816979	All right.
9817059	9820380	So I was going to let you guys know.
9820440	9826303	I just came across, during my time at Gen Con, I came across a certain game.
9827783	9834046	I don't think you guys have covered it, but I might as well just let you guys know.
9834086	9842509	I played around with it, and I know we're talking about Hearthstone and all that, but this game, wow.
9843150	9843930	It's a card game.
9844481	9846262	but the MMO card game.
9846442	9846682	Really?
9846742	9849563	I don't know if you guys have heard of it.
9849683	9851864	It's called Hex Shards of Fate.
9853785	9857466	The title sounds familiar but I don't know much about it.
9857526	9863068	I feel like it's one of those games we probably had a rapid fire news story on at one point and I didn't really look into it.
9863929	9866249	But you have my attention.
9866309	9867170	Tell us more about it.
9868630	9869031	Alright.
9869071	9869671	Yeah, I know.
9869711	9871371	It's like MMO card game.
9871391	9872292	What the hell?
9872332	9872732	Sounds great.
9873411	9876676	It's being developed by Cryptozoic Games.
9876916	9884727	They are the ones that, for those who listen to Horde House, Cryptozoic has a license for the World of Warcraft games.
9886146	9888847	Actually, I don't know if you heard about this, Degenerate Johnny.
9889147	9898829	Blizzard announced this week, I'll throw this in here as a last-minute story, that the latest expansion of the WoW trading card game is the last, and that they are no longer going to be making it.
9898849	9902990	They are ending that relationship, and there's no plans in the future to continue the WoW trading card game.
9903470	9909011	I don't know if that's because of Hearthstone or what, but I thought I would throw that little nugget out there just because I read that the other day.
9909091	9909771	Anyway, sorry.
9910611	9913412	I heard about that, actually, at Gen Con.
9913432	9915292	I was talking with one of the Cryptozote guys, and
9915765	9918746	They did mention that it was going to be the last expansion.
9919647	9928271	Their relationship has matured with Blizzard to a degree that now they're going to develop their own type of games.
9928911	9933693	I think this Hex Shards of Fate game is actually evidence of that.
9936714	9938415	I'm just wowed about it.
9938995	9941957	Basically, Hex Shards of Fate is a...
9943240	9970565	It actually had a Kickstarter earlier this summer, actually, and they just wanted a Kickstarter just to finish off the game, but they managed to get like seven times the amount that they were asking for it, so now it's going to be able to be available for Apple tablets and Android tablets, so lots of stuff is going on with this game, and
9971209	9972469	It's actually pretty exciting.
9972729	9977530	It's due to be released in sometime this holiday season.
9977810	9978251	It's free to play.
9978271	9980071	It's actually following probably the same type of business model as
9994178	9997679	Blizzard is doing with Hearthstone, basically $2 a pack.
9997959	10000740	However, they're also adding a freemium service.
10000800	10023267	So if you want to have a discount on your packs and gain access to tournaments free of charge, they're offering a VIP access, which is basically $4 a month type of thing, kind of like a subscription, but you get a pack every week.
10024093	10025575	Oh, okay.
10025835	10027657	It's a card of the month club.
10028198	10029379	The card of the week club.
10029479	10033744	Just say cancel at any time and we'll stop sending you the cards.
10034285	10034926	That's kind of funny.
10035246	10036207	Right, exactly.
10036588	10044337	Yeah, so it's going to have an auction house for you to trade your cards, buy
10044853	10049895	Yeah, there's so much information, and I just want to let you know that they are going to be at DragonCon.
10050695	10051155	Oh, cool.
10051175	10058918	So, anybody who's going to go there, or if you, or Bobby, you know, if anybody wants to see around, they will be at DragonCon, so you can see it for yourself.
10059315	10083612	Degenerate Johnny, I thought of you recently because I know you're a big card game fan and a friend of mine introduced me to a card game and I did the whole thing where I actually went to the comic book shop and played this game with my friends he was actually doing a lot of demos with this game at GamerX so I want to give a shout out to this game because it was a lot of fun totally not the game you called in to talk about tonight but I hijacked your call, I'm sorry but the game is called Sentinels of the Multiverse have you played this?
10085954	10087615	I've seen it being played at
10089255	10090276	Sounds very familiar.
10090296	10096459	It sounds kind of similar to Lord of the Rings because Lord of the Rings is a game where you basically go up against a
10118365	10126227	Deck, that it's not you, but it's not another player, it's just you taking on scenarios.
10126667	10130928	And you can do it in co-op, so you can be in your own fellowship.
10130968	10145932	So that's very interesting, and I'm seeing that it's pretty interesting that card games are now making the rise of basically you don't have to find someone to play with, you can play it with yourself, or
10146480	10146841	and so on.
10158218	10159219	what's the name of the game again?
10159439	10185559	Sentinels of the Multiverse and we actually might get the guy on one of the shows later on or one of the developers of the game because I don't think it would be a good fit for OLR but I'm going to see if some of the other VOG shows are interested in it so if not we'll do a Google Hangout or something but yeah anyway Degenerate Johnny I should probably let you go so we can wrap up the show but thanks for your call always a pleasure to hear from you my pleasure take care
10186110	10187653	You guys take care.
10187794	10188114	Bye-bye.
10200518	10202420	A couple other tweets here from some listeners.
10202540	10204861	If you do want to give us a call, we can try to squeeze in one more call.
10204881	10208324	1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio.
10208945	10210126	TigerClaw sends us a tweet.
10210466	10212067	Blizzard on World of Warcraft.
10212107	10213688	We'd be lost without casuals.
10213989	10218652	Oh, before I get to that, I should... TigerClaw sent in that tweet on Metroid Fan Film.
10219072	10226939	He wanted to clarify, make sure we report on the fact that the fan film was only going to be 10 minutes and non-for-profit, but they were asking for $90,000 to fund it.
10226979	10227059	What?
10229160	10229581	10 minutes?
10229681	10230262	Come on.
10230302	10232164	Maybe they were going to actually film in space.
10232324	10232745	I don't know.
10233526	10234387	I didn't read up on it.
10235468	10236730	Alright, look.
10236750	10238592	We got another call coming in, so let's go to it.
10238612	10239633	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
10239653	10240014	Who's this?
10240755	10242237	Hi, this is Ragenator.
10242277	10242938	Hey, Ragenator.
10242958	10243498	How you doing?
10244339	10245280	Okay, I guess.
10245361	10246382	It's a webcam call.
10246402	10246862	Good to see you.
10253163	10276674	I don't think it's been mentioned either last week or the week before although you did mention some news that was kind of sort of related I think it was last week and the week before you mentioned that Microsoft is getting rid of the Microsoft coins and they also in turn they're getting rid of the games for Windows Marketplace
10277675	10285301	One thing that was not mentioned is that they're getting rid of the Zune marketplace.
10288023	10299132	And in fact, I found this out through an email that Microsoft had sent out to me not too long ago.
10300773	10306998	And the way it's been explained to me, the reason why they're getting rid of the Zune marketplace is because
10308115	10319403	You know, apparently the Zoom Microfaces set up in such a way that it would only recognize Microsoft points as a method of payment.
10319463	10328830	They won't recognize dollars and cents or pesos or euros or whatever your local currency happens to be.
10328850	10329951	Right, right.
10332222	10343624	To catch 22 is, if you have an Xbox 360, you'll still be able to use the 12-in-2.
10344004	10346925	But with the old tech, you're screwed, basically.
10347605	10347925	Yeah.
10349465	10358307	I think this is why, Reginator, knowing a company's exit strategy for the inevitable day that they close their doors in the day and age of digital distribution is so important.
10358687	10386859	and I think that's one reason everybody kind of goes to Steam a little bit because Steam has made it very clear should we ever close our doors we have the magic button that we can press that will make all the games DRM free and you won't have to connect to the servers anymore but you know when we talk about movies and music and so forth that really sucks if you were one of those people who actually invested in a Zune and it's like okay you'll have those movies but you can't really use the Zune now for anything else or like my HD DVD player
10388236	10409787	You know, the weird thing is, at least with me, ever since Sony burned me a handful of times, when I still had my PlayStation 3, I had to send my system in to get repaired to have my VOs reactivated, I slowly but surely made my way over to the Zoom service and been getting...
10411273	10414554	TV shows and movies and this and that.
10415115	10422297	Granted, the vast majority of the stuff were the freebies, but I do have my fair share of the paid content.
10422918	10435823	In fact, case in point, I've just been going to 90's and VOG music soundtrack whenever I've been getting
10437999	10445724	I've been using this service for my PC because I don't have iTunes or anything I happen to have.
10456399	10465101	Xbox accounts set up for when I still had the 360, so no need for extra passwords, remembers, so on and so forth.
10466521	10477084	Ragenator, this is kind of a crap situation, but unfortunately, this is the downside to tech, and especially when our tech advances so fast.
10477144	10479004	So I think tough lesson learned.
10479424	10486365	always take a look at that user license agreement even though you're not going to sit there and read all 27 pages or 99 pages or however long it is.
10486765	10491846	Look for that part that talks about who really owns the stuff that you're buying and what's going to happen.
10492286	10497887	But anyway, Ragenator, we're going to wrap up so we can wrap up the show but any quick other thoughts you want to get out before we let you go?
10498727	10499487	No, there'll be.
10499547	10505909	I just want to really mention the closing of that particular service since it really wasn't mentioned before.
10506329	10506769	All right.
10507149	10507349	All right.
10507389	10507989	Well, take care, buddy.
10508009	10508489	Thanks for the call.
10509335	10510056	Alright, have a good one.
10510176	10510697	Alright, you too.
10510897	10511037	Bye-bye.
10511057	10511197	Bye-bye.
10511958	10513459	Sorry, did I already check?
10513479	10514020	Do we have anything else?
10514040	10514460	No, that's it.
10531718	10532798	No more last minute stories.
10533558	10534159	Alright, let me see.
10534199	10537839	I think I had one other tweet here that I wanted to do.
10539940	10546742	Oh, TheGarthWolf sent us a tweet that says, I totally got into the XIV Coral server tonight.
10547222	10550222	Got to play the intro quest and now maintenance just started.
10550282	10551063	Just my luck.
10551483	10556784	We were talking a little bit about the Final Fantasy XIV, kind of the bumpy launch they've been having.
10557264	10560925	Let's just hope in a week it's all a distant memory.
10561545	10564148	Oh, I want to make sure I got this one in.
10564188	10565709	Grandpa from Horde House sent this tweet.
10565729	10567871	I almost forgot it because he sent it earlier in the day.
10569653	10570714	Oh, it's a video.
10572375	10581524	Okay, long story short, it's another one of those freaking sensationalistic CNN things where an eight-year-old shot his 90-year-old caretaker and it was because of a violent video game.
10581544	10586128	And I think, don't quote me on this, but I think this is the one that Piers Morgan on his Twitter said,
10586728	10594314	wrote out there and said, don't tell me after hearing things like this that violent video games don't cause violent behavior and da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da, blah-blah-blah.
10594574	10611508	So here we go again with the media, you know, well, and this is a nightmare that an eight-year-old boy would shoot his 90-year-old caretaker, but who was letting an eight-year-old game play violent video games unsupervised?
10611588	10613389	I'm not blaming the 90-year-old.
10613449	10615791	I'm blaming the parents.
10615811	10616011	All right.
10616031	10617032	All right.
10645083	10645464	That's it.
10645904	10646545	I think we're done.
10647586	10652353	It's been a crazy show tonight, but we're on out of here for the next two weeks.
10653754	10655657	Thank you guys, as always, for listening to our show.
10655737	10656558	Thanks for your download.
10656598	10657419	Thanks for your support.
10657780	10660123	We always appreciate you supporting Independent Radio.
10661084	10663307	Hopefully you liked what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio.
10663687	10667149	But if you didn't, just be sure to support other independent broadcasters.
10667430	10671993	There's many people out there working very hard to put these types of shows together.
10672313	10674294	And we all appreciate your support so much.
10674734	10677696	And I'm not going to ask you for your money or a financial donation.
10678377	10681219	But I will ask, if you like what you heard, spread the word.
10681319	10683280	Tell a friend or two about the show.
10683680	10687543	Post a nice five-star review on iTunes or give us a thumbs up in Stitcher or whatever.
10687923	10693287	Help us spread the word about the show because that is all the marketing that we can afford is word of mouth.
10694807	10696668	Loki, any last-minute thoughts tonight?
10697128	10703129	I'm going to just try to finish up Saints Row 4 this week, maybe even tonight, because I'm almost at 100%.
10703169	10704609	Let's talk about how to do it.
10705190	10705690	You can do it.
10706590	10717332	My final thought is I hope I get to play at least another hour of Final Fantasy XIV tonight, but we'll see if that stupid maintenance finishes right at the time I get home from picking up Alan.
10717352	10718293	That would be fantastic.
10718673	10719573	Fantastic timing.
10720353	10723556	Alright, well that does it for another week here at Orange Lounge Radio.
10723596	10725117	We will be back in two weeks.
10725217	10727639	Have a great Labor Day, those of you guys here in the States.
10727980	10730062	For those of you in other countries, have a great week.
10730982	10736287	Enjoy your time and have fun playing the various online games that are launching over the next two weeks.
10736627	10741772	We will be back for another show live Sunday, September 8th.
10742432	10744634	So we'll see you then with another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
