00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:25,056
[SPEAKER_01]: Tonight, August 25th, 2013, the PlayStation 4's launch is detailed, League of Legends experiences a security breach, and you can soon return digital copies of games in one online store.

2
00:00:31,431 --> 00:00:36,832
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, my friends out there on the Internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

3
00:00:36,972 --> 00:00:43,034
[SPEAKER_03]: It is Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 517 for this August the 25th of 2013.

4
00:00:44,914 --> 00:00:54,716
[SPEAKER_03]: Pull up a chair in our live chat room, live.vognetwork.com, where you can participate with the program as we talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

5
00:00:54,776 --> 00:00:58,017
[SPEAKER_03]: My name's Rob Roberts, here with you as always every week.

6
00:00:58,357 --> 00:01:01,398
[SPEAKER_03]: My co-hosts, say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

7
00:01:01,738 --> 00:01:01,958
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi.

8
00:01:02,158 --> 00:01:02,739
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, how are you?

9
00:01:03,139 --> 00:01:03,519
[SPEAKER_04]: Sniffy.

10
00:01:03,619 --> 00:01:05,860
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you sound like you are having heck of allergies today.

11
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:07,140
[SPEAKER_04]: Or something.

12
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:13,483
[SPEAKER_04]: I just, this morning I woke up and was really congested and it's all sinus too because it's all just in my nose.

13
00:01:13,763 --> 00:01:19,605
[SPEAKER_03]: I know the city where we're based, Sacramento, California, is not a very pleasant one for allergy sufferers.

14
00:01:20,505 --> 00:01:22,406
[SPEAKER_03]: But I always thought that was more of a spring thing.

15
00:01:22,486 --> 00:01:24,607
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can get it pretty bad this time of year too.

16
00:01:25,226 --> 00:01:26,927
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even know what set it off, really.

17
00:01:27,027 --> 00:01:28,768
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it may have been left over from the fires.

18
00:01:28,848 --> 00:01:30,669
[SPEAKER_04]: It could have been... I don't know.

19
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:33,110
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, those fires.

20
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:40,334
[SPEAKER_03]: There's these horrible fires burning outside of Yosemite, this big national park that's... Now, it's really far.

21
00:01:40,374 --> 00:01:43,396
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, it's probably, what, like a five, six-hour drive from here?

22
00:01:43,416 --> 00:01:44,877
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, it caused a minor heat wave for us.

23
00:01:44,917 --> 00:01:47,898
[SPEAKER_03]: But, oh, yeah, I mean, it's really burning out of control.

24
00:01:47,938 --> 00:01:52,341
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't think I know anybody in the OLR listening base that lives in that area, but if you do...

25
00:01:53,101 --> 00:01:59,965
[SPEAKER_03]: I really hope you're safe and taking care of yourself, you know, and my thoughts go out to you guys, because pretty terrible, that fire out there.

26
00:02:00,366 --> 00:02:06,410
[SPEAKER_04]: I've had Benadryl and Sudafed, and I even laid down, well, it just doesn't seem to be doing much good.

27
00:02:08,071 --> 00:02:09,251
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I hope you feel better.

28
00:02:09,271 --> 00:02:10,232
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sick.

29
00:02:10,312 --> 00:02:11,853
[SPEAKER_03]: Despite all the fires and all that.

30
00:02:12,093 --> 00:02:13,074
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel awful, though.

31
00:02:13,614 --> 00:02:14,575
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, feel better.

32
00:02:14,815 --> 00:02:17,396
[SPEAKER_03]: If you need more coffee, because coffee helps.

33
00:02:18,117 --> 00:02:19,658
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm full of Ricolas now.

34
00:02:19,929 --> 00:02:27,315
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, speaking of our hometown of Sacramento, I wanted to mention this real quick with you and we referenced this on Bobby Blackwolf's show just before we went live tonight.

35
00:02:27,695 --> 00:02:36,643
[SPEAKER_03]: But here in Sacramento, California, you know, once in a while we get celebrities because they come up here from Hollywood to lobby for different bills and so forth.

36
00:02:37,143 --> 00:02:38,284
[SPEAKER_04]: Or in this case, come from England.

37
00:02:38,524 --> 00:02:41,787
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, or we used to have a governor, but I won't go there.

38
00:02:41,887 --> 00:02:42,648
[SPEAKER_03]: Y'all know about that.

39
00:02:43,148 --> 00:02:45,750
[SPEAKER_03]: But in this case... That's actually happened twice.

40
00:02:46,271 --> 00:02:46,771
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true.

41
00:02:46,951 --> 00:02:47,312
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true.

42
00:02:47,332 --> 00:02:48,112
[SPEAKER_03]: Because there was Reagan.

43
00:02:48,132 --> 00:02:49,434
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, he was a famous movie actor too.

44
00:02:50,835 --> 00:02:52,676
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway, past all the politics stuff.

45
00:02:54,398 --> 00:02:56,420
[SPEAKER_03]: Democrat, Republican, and everything in between.

46
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:57,821
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't matter who you are.

47
00:02:57,881 --> 00:02:59,082
[SPEAKER_03]: You love John Barrowman.

48
00:02:59,202 --> 00:02:59,562
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yes.

49
00:02:59,963 --> 00:03:00,863
[SPEAKER_03]: If you know who he is.

50
00:03:01,464 --> 00:03:02,565
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll get to that in a minute.

51
00:03:02,945 --> 00:03:05,027
[SPEAKER_03]: Because Tech Master Loki had no idea who he was.

52
00:03:05,327 --> 00:03:08,129
[SPEAKER_03]: But he's from Doctor Who and Torchwood.

53
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:13,294
[SPEAKER_03]: And he was one of the people in the new producers.

54
00:03:13,434 --> 00:03:19,779
[SPEAKER_04]: He also was on a couple of series in England where it was like one of them was How Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria?

55
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:20,379
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, yeah.

56
00:03:20,399 --> 00:03:22,521
[SPEAKER_04]: Where they cast for West End plays.

57
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:23,722
[SPEAKER_03]: He did stage stuff and all that.

58
00:03:23,802 --> 00:03:25,764
[SPEAKER_04]: It's basically like American Idol for stage theater.

59
00:03:26,284 --> 00:03:35,352
[SPEAKER_03]: and he's just, no matter your sexuality or who you are, like you have to admit, he is a very gorgeous, handsome man.

60
00:03:36,192 --> 00:03:39,355
[SPEAKER_03]: So a lot of people like him for that reason alone.

61
00:03:39,535 --> 00:03:41,957
[SPEAKER_03]: But he's here in Sacramento and we can't figure out why.

62
00:03:42,698 --> 00:03:45,080
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a big nerd convention coming up next weekend.

63
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:46,301
[SPEAKER_04]: Can't he just be in town?

64
00:03:46,841 --> 00:03:51,743
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess, but I'm kind of like, well, why would he... Well, and I'm even thinking about the little bit I know about him.

65
00:03:51,783 --> 00:03:52,663
[SPEAKER_04]: His family's in Florida.

66
00:03:52,683 --> 00:03:53,003
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

67
00:03:53,103 --> 00:03:55,604
[SPEAKER_04]: And the rest of his... And he lives in England.

68
00:03:55,904 --> 00:03:56,284
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knows?

69
00:03:56,644 --> 00:03:59,205
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe he came to San Francisco and thought he'd swing by.

70
00:03:59,685 --> 00:04:00,666
[SPEAKER_03]: But here's my hope.

71
00:04:00,686 --> 00:04:07,588
[SPEAKER_03]: Since he's supposed to be at DragonCon in a few days, as am I, I got my fingers and my toes crossed that we might be on the same flight.

72
00:04:09,309 --> 00:04:15,693
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't pray very often, but if anybody up there is listening, I want to be on the same flight as John Barrowman to Atlanta.

73
00:04:16,233 --> 00:04:17,954
[SPEAKER_03]: Five and a half hours on a plane with John Barrowman.

74
00:04:17,974 --> 00:04:19,315
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, please!

75
00:04:19,495 --> 00:04:20,095
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you flying?

76
00:04:20,756 --> 00:04:21,116
[SPEAKER_03]: Delta.

77
00:04:22,837 --> 00:04:25,219
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the only one that had a direct flight to Atlanta.

78
00:04:25,239 --> 00:04:26,239
[SPEAKER_04]: It might have a first class.

79
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:27,800
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think they do.

80
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:29,121
[SPEAKER_04]: I wonder if his husband came along.

81
00:04:30,354 --> 00:04:30,714
[SPEAKER_03]: I think so.

82
00:04:30,734 --> 00:04:31,415
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he was in the pictures.

83
00:04:31,435 --> 00:04:31,835
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, anyway.

84
00:04:32,496 --> 00:04:34,818
[SPEAKER_04]: Listeners are here to... They're entirely too cute together.

85
00:04:34,938 --> 00:04:41,424
[SPEAKER_03]: They're here to hear about video games, not to hear about John Barrowman, although quite frankly, who's going to complain?

86
00:04:41,784 --> 00:04:44,146
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe Tech Master Loki will complain.

87
00:04:44,186 --> 00:04:45,567
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, Tech Master Loki, how you doing?

88
00:04:45,747 --> 00:04:46,348
[SPEAKER_02]: Doing good.

89
00:04:46,488 --> 00:04:46,748
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah?

90
00:04:47,569 --> 00:04:49,671
[SPEAKER_03]: John Barrowman, Adam's Ass in a Photo Op

91
00:05:13,288 --> 00:05:17,401
[SPEAKER_03]: and I bet Adam didn't wash that ass for an entire week.

92
00:05:17,481 --> 00:05:18,786
[SPEAKER_04]: Or at least the jeans attached to the ass.

93
00:05:18,806 --> 00:05:20,090
[SPEAKER_03]: At least the jeans attached to them.

94
00:05:22,763 --> 00:05:25,905
[SPEAKER_03]: Techinus in chat suggesting I make friends with a stewardess.

95
00:05:26,605 --> 00:05:27,586
[SPEAKER_03]: I may have to.

96
00:05:27,606 --> 00:05:29,047
[SPEAKER_04]: They're called flight attendants now.

97
00:05:30,567 --> 00:05:33,369
[SPEAKER_03]: Alan Alchemy says, Rob, you aren't in first class though.

98
00:05:33,749 --> 00:05:37,171
[SPEAKER_03]: That doesn't mean I won't still find a way to run into him.

99
00:05:37,711 --> 00:05:39,312
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't question my powers.

100
00:05:40,613 --> 00:05:40,913
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

101
00:05:42,073 --> 00:05:42,354
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow.

102
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:44,515
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, how have you been?

103
00:05:44,555 --> 00:05:45,136
[SPEAKER_03]: What's new with you?

104
00:05:47,598 --> 00:05:48,359
[SPEAKER_03]: Not a whole ton.

105
00:05:48,779 --> 00:05:55,845
[SPEAKER_03]: So I thought of you earlier today because apparently all this Grand Theft Auto 5 information is leaking to the internet.

106
00:05:56,326 --> 00:06:05,394
[SPEAKER_03]: And at first I thought, oh my gosh, there's a pirated version of the game out there already and those poor guys are going to lose those sales because it's already out there on the internet when we're weeks away from launch.

107
00:06:06,355 --> 00:06:08,297
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's not totally the case, right, Loki?

108
00:06:08,337 --> 00:06:09,798
[SPEAKER_03]: What's going on in the Grand Theft Auto world?

109
00:06:10,218 --> 00:06:15,901
[SPEAKER_02]: The European region had the digital version of it that people had pre-ordered.

110
00:06:16,482 --> 00:06:18,683
[SPEAKER_02]: It became live for a little bit.

111
00:06:19,483 --> 00:06:22,185
[SPEAKER_02]: Not necessarily live, but you can pre-load it.

112
00:06:22,265 --> 00:06:26,207
[SPEAKER_02]: People were downloading the 18GB file to their PS3.

113
00:06:26,347 --> 00:06:32,791
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, they would dump it and try to hack it to get it to run and stuff.

114
00:06:32,811 --> 00:06:32,951
[SPEAKER_02]: But

115
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:33,792
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

116
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:56,355
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, he says there's no way to open up the archives yet because they don't have the keys to do that.

117
00:06:56,915 --> 00:07:00,078
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't think that the executable is included with that.

118
00:07:00,118 --> 00:07:01,599
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's what comes in the patch.

119
00:07:01,699 --> 00:07:02,760
[SPEAKER_02]: So even if you could...

120
00:07:04,082 --> 00:07:06,444
[SPEAKER_02]: WhatUpG in our chatroom says the soundtrack leaked.

121
00:07:22,903 --> 00:07:31,751
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so the soundtrack's leaked, and a lot of the spoilers from the game have leaked as well because they have all the cutscene audio, so people are documenting it.

122
00:07:31,771 --> 00:07:34,413
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been pretty good in trying to stay away from all that stuff.

123
00:07:34,473 --> 00:07:45,303
[SPEAKER_02]: I did read one thing, but I kind of figured some of the people from the other games would be coming back in the game, like a cameo or something like that, so it's not a huge deal.

124
00:07:45,783 --> 00:07:49,026
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm trying not to read any spoilers in the game.

125
00:07:49,046 --> 00:07:49,106
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

126
00:07:49,206 --> 00:07:49,746
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

127
00:08:03,266 --> 00:08:07,909
[SPEAKER_02]: If there was a working version out there that leaked to the internet, that's a whole other story.

128
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:11,732
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not necessarily spoiling, you're playing through the game.

129
00:08:11,752 --> 00:08:12,372
[SPEAKER_02]: Illegally.

130
00:08:13,053 --> 00:08:18,376
[SPEAKER_02]: I intend on purchasing on both platforms, so I don't care.

131
00:08:18,757 --> 00:08:19,797
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you, Loki.

132
00:08:20,158 --> 00:08:27,002
[SPEAKER_03]: If it did leak, you would be downloading it and playing it, and yes, you'd be one of those bad people, but you would still be buying two copies of it.

133
00:08:27,202 --> 00:08:27,663
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.

134
00:08:28,203 --> 00:08:56,897
[SPEAKER_02]: that's why I'm not giving you a worse time about it yeah I'm still you know I'm buying it on both platforms just so I can play with my friends because I don't know what platform they're going to play on you know I still want to play on 360 because I like the controller better but you know my boss plays on PS3 and he's trying to get other people to buy the PS3 version as well I guess there's one of my co-workers in Dallas he's buying both versions as well so I still want to play on 360 but I think a lot of people are playing on PS3 as well so I'll just have to play both

135
00:08:58,198 --> 00:09:02,702
[SPEAKER_03]: and WhatUpG in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com also says, I am not here to spoil things.

136
00:09:02,762 --> 00:09:04,543
[SPEAKER_03]: If people want spoilers, they can look for them.

137
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:07,025
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's the nice thing to do, so please, chatters.

138
00:09:07,806 --> 00:09:13,911
[SPEAKER_02]: Y'all are very well behaved, but please do not spoil Grand Theft Auto V. If you want to look up spoilers, it's on gtaforums.com.

139
00:09:13,931 --> 00:09:20,016
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a whole section of their forum dedicated to Grand Theft Auto V spoilers if you really want to look at it, but...

140
00:09:20,917 --> 00:09:21,778
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

141
00:09:36,912 --> 00:09:37,613
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm fine with that.

142
00:09:37,713 --> 00:09:39,074
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll look at the track list.

143
00:09:39,094 --> 00:09:40,235
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not spoiling anything for me.

144
00:09:40,255 --> 00:09:42,317
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not a big deal.

145
00:09:42,357 --> 00:09:45,279
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to look up any of the cutscene audio stuff.

146
00:09:45,319 --> 00:09:47,421
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to listen to any of that.

147
00:09:48,782 --> 00:09:52,986
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just too close to coming out to spoil myself on some of the stuff in the game.

148
00:09:53,566 --> 00:09:53,907
[SPEAKER_02]: Good for you.

149
00:09:54,407 --> 00:09:56,648
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like Easter eggs and stuff, that's a whole different thing.

150
00:09:56,949 --> 00:09:58,770
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll look that stuff up because it's fun.

151
00:09:58,830 --> 00:09:59,851
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

152
00:09:59,931 --> 00:10:03,393
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I know you are very much looking forward to Grand Theft Auto V. What's the big day again?

153
00:10:03,433 --> 00:10:04,394
[SPEAKER_03]: We're about three weeks out.

154
00:10:04,734 --> 00:10:04,814
[SPEAKER_02]: 17th.

155
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:05,615
[SPEAKER_02]: Four weeks out.

156
00:10:05,675 --> 00:10:07,636
[SPEAKER_02]: 17th, but I'm hoping to get that Friday before.

157
00:10:08,877 --> 00:10:10,998
[SPEAKER_03]: Using your connections.

158
00:10:11,038 --> 00:10:11,439
[SPEAKER_03]: I need it.

159
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:17,963
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll get into what we've been playing this week, but I do have a few other topics I want to address here at the top of the show.

160
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:20,825
[SPEAKER_03]: First off, I do want to say a big hello and hi.

161
00:10:20,845 --> 00:10:20,885
[SPEAKER_03]: It

162
00:10:21,886 --> 00:10:22,146
[SPEAKER_03]: DragonCon

163
00:10:49,045 --> 00:10:49,685
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

164
00:11:09,013 --> 00:11:09,614
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

165
00:11:28,911 --> 00:11:35,716
[SPEAKER_03]: I've met a variety of listeners at PAX East and E3 and PAX Prime and whatever other conventions I've been at, ASEN, so forth.

166
00:11:35,776 --> 00:11:38,178
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would love to meet more at DragonCon.

167
00:11:38,878 --> 00:11:40,539
[SPEAKER_03]: You get three opportunities now.

168
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:45,763
[SPEAKER_03]: The folks at DragonCon have been wonderful in just kind of helping us get involved.

169
00:11:46,443 --> 00:11:56,550
[SPEAKER_03]: So Saturday night, 5.30 at the Hilton 203, the VOG Super Show, where several of us from VOG are going to get together to talk about the story about VOG Network and

170
00:11:56,870 --> 00:12:02,515
[SPEAKER_03]: and talk about what it's like to have been podcasting for so long and where we see our future is going and maybe

171
00:12:03,271 --> 00:12:04,972
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a surprise announcement in store.

172
00:12:05,212 --> 00:12:08,214
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be recording that, because that would be kind of cool to record that.

173
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:11,857
[SPEAKER_03]: We will be recording that, and Bobby will be putting it on his feed later on.

174
00:12:12,177 --> 00:12:14,058
[SPEAKER_03]: So that will be awesome.

175
00:12:14,278 --> 00:12:16,720
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, Bobby Blackwolf says, hello to people in the future.

176
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:21,423
[SPEAKER_03]: That is literally what I'm doing right now, saying hello to the future people, the tomorrow people.

177
00:12:21,543 --> 00:12:32,631
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, you know, I'd have to give you my little contribution on the whole thing, and that would be sitting in the middle of my classroom, in my portfolio class, using that time to work on Logo.

178
00:12:34,132 --> 00:12:38,017
[SPEAKER_04]: and my teacher being perfectly fine with it because it was all stuff that was going to go in my portfolio.

179
00:12:38,577 --> 00:12:40,019
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I'll do for you, DarkSakura?

180
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:42,462
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that the panel to kind of make it like you were there?

181
00:12:42,782 --> 00:12:47,628
[SPEAKER_03]: Just every 30 seconds or so, I'll just go... No.

182
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:49,630
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just kidding.

183
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:50,351
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't sound like that.

184
00:12:51,532 --> 00:12:52,513
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just being a jerk.

185
00:12:52,653 --> 00:12:52,913
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

186
00:12:53,293 --> 00:12:55,095
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you're being a bitch.

187
00:12:55,995 --> 00:12:58,137
[SPEAKER_03]: In all seriousness, giving Jamie a hard time.

188
00:12:58,917 --> 00:13:02,660
[SPEAKER_03]: In all seriousness, though, on Sunday, we're going to be a part of the Parsec Awards.

189
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:06,322
[SPEAKER_03]: We have been honored to be asked to be a part of that.

190
00:13:06,662 --> 00:13:13,147
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's going to be like, I don't know, it's going to be like I'm on stage at the Oscars giving an award, although it's on a much different scale.

191
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:13,707
[SPEAKER_03]: Wear a swan dress.

192
00:13:15,408 --> 00:13:16,209
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what you should do.

193
00:13:16,229 --> 00:13:18,691
[SPEAKER_04]: You need to wear a swan dress with an egg.

194
00:13:19,011 --> 00:13:22,434
[SPEAKER_03]: I would sit on Travis's lap and lay an egg.

195
00:13:22,715 --> 00:13:23,695
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you know what we need to do?

196
00:13:24,056 --> 00:13:24,256
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

197
00:13:24,316 --> 00:13:31,002
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to go to an airbrush place that does t-shirts and have them make you a swan.

198
00:13:31,222 --> 00:13:32,103
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, you've got 48 hours.

199
00:13:33,664 --> 00:13:34,144
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

200
00:13:34,324 --> 00:13:36,585
[SPEAKER_04]: I've had one done in an hour, so you can get a swan.

201
00:13:36,625 --> 00:13:37,245
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll draw you a swan.

202
00:13:37,265 --> 00:13:39,085
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be awesome, a swan dress t-shirt.

203
00:13:40,265 --> 00:13:41,166
[SPEAKER_03]: That could be pretty sweet.

204
00:13:41,186 --> 00:13:41,966
[SPEAKER_03]: That could be pretty sweet.

205
00:13:42,426 --> 00:13:43,306
[SPEAKER_03]: You can be Bjork.

206
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:44,466
[SPEAKER_03]: So that will be that.

207
00:13:44,506 --> 00:13:46,907
[SPEAKER_03]: We are presenting one of the awards towards the end of the ceremony.

208
00:13:47,287 --> 00:13:53,708
[SPEAKER_03]: And then on Monday, there's a panel about live streaming and about doing live streams and so forth.

209
00:13:54,068 --> 00:13:55,069
[SPEAKER_03]: Bobby's on the panel.

210
00:13:55,149 --> 00:13:56,209
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just going to support.

211
00:13:56,529 --> 00:14:02,010
[SPEAKER_03]: And as somebody who does a lot of live streaming himself through this show, through game streaming and so forth...

212
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:03,491
[SPEAKER_03]: And that'll be a good time.

213
00:14:03,511 --> 00:14:07,954
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's Monday at 11, 1130 in the morning.

214
00:14:07,994 --> 00:14:08,694
[SPEAKER_03]: Just look for the streaming.

215
00:14:08,714 --> 00:14:09,555
[SPEAKER_04]: At something in the morning.

216
00:14:09,895 --> 00:14:10,856
[SPEAKER_03]: At something in the morning.

217
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:12,237
[SPEAKER_03]: And let's just put it this way.

218
00:14:12,257 --> 00:14:19,141
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be a miracle that I'm awake because I'll probably still be on the West Coast clock and on convention sleep.

219
00:14:19,281 --> 00:14:20,482
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be a miracle that I'm awake.

220
00:14:20,582 --> 00:14:21,423
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, boo-hoo.

221
00:14:21,523 --> 00:14:21,903
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, right?

222
00:14:21,923 --> 00:14:23,104
[SPEAKER_02]: Eight o'clock in the morning.

223
00:14:23,584 --> 00:14:28,705
[SPEAKER_03]: On convention time though, oh my gosh.

224
00:14:29,405 --> 00:14:32,386
[SPEAKER_03]: I've already been told about all the drinks I'm going to be made to consume.

225
00:14:32,446 --> 00:14:34,367
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's hope I don't end up in the hospital for heaven's sake.

226
00:14:34,427 --> 00:14:40,408
[SPEAKER_02]: If I could make it to a morning where I actually woke up as late as 8 o'clock, that would be a miracle.

227
00:14:40,528 --> 00:14:52,471
[SPEAKER_03]: I know I might sound peppy today because there's a lot of things to be excited about, but last night, thanks to traffic, we went to San Francisco last night and didn't get back home because of traffic until 3 in the morning.

228
00:14:53,371 --> 00:14:54,652
[SPEAKER_03]: and... Baseball game or something?

229
00:14:55,192 --> 00:14:59,333
[SPEAKER_03]: No, there was construction on Highway 80 where they were reducing it down to one lane.

230
00:14:59,413 --> 00:15:00,274
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they repaving lanes?

231
00:15:00,434 --> 00:15:04,415
[SPEAKER_03]: Every asshole has to speed up as far as they can to the last minute to merge in.

232
00:15:04,455 --> 00:15:07,376
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they were also putting up warnings that the Bay Bridge was going to be closed during the next week.

233
00:15:07,636 --> 00:15:08,817
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not even it, though.

234
00:15:08,837 --> 00:15:09,317
[SPEAKER_02]: So what is it?

235
00:15:09,437 --> 00:15:16,479
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this like national or, I don't know, like California State, you know, Repave Your Street Month or something?

236
00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:19,440
[SPEAKER_02]: Because everybody is repaving the goddamn street.

237
00:15:20,021 --> 00:15:20,481
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody.

238
00:15:20,801 --> 00:15:20,941
[SPEAKER_02]: Like,

239
00:15:21,201 --> 00:15:24,142
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody is doing it all like the last couple weeks.

240
00:15:25,743 --> 00:15:27,503
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there's a lot of construction stuff.

241
00:15:27,543 --> 00:15:29,304
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, listeners don't care about that.

242
00:15:29,984 --> 00:15:31,044
[SPEAKER_03]: But DragonCon, yes.

243
00:15:31,084 --> 00:15:33,185
[SPEAKER_03]: So things going on Saturday, Sunday, Monday.

244
00:15:33,425 --> 00:15:37,527
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to follow me on Twitter, I'll post updates about where I'm at provided my phone has a charge.

245
00:15:37,867 --> 00:15:40,287
[SPEAKER_03]: Twitter.com slash Sky, S-K-I-E.

246
00:15:40,327 --> 00:15:41,348
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my personal Twitter.

247
00:15:41,908 --> 00:15:44,469
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can follow me there and get your DragonCon updates.

248
00:15:45,509 --> 00:15:50,613
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, Loki, sadly not coming with me to DragonCon, but I know we'll be following the news from PAX at home.

249
00:15:50,793 --> 00:15:51,673
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to SchoolCon.

250
00:15:51,934 --> 00:15:52,174
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you?

251
00:15:52,194 --> 00:15:52,694
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

252
00:15:52,714 --> 00:15:53,214
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's good.

253
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:56,116
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm actually dropping a class and taking another class.

254
00:15:56,156 --> 00:15:58,298
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm surprised you're not going to go to SacAnime at least for a day.

255
00:15:58,358 --> 00:15:58,998
[SPEAKER_03]: Just check it out.

256
00:15:59,218 --> 00:16:00,920
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob, SacAnime costs money.

257
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,300
[SPEAKER_03]: Guess who doesn't have a job?

258
00:16:02,381 --> 00:16:02,721
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true.

259
00:16:02,761 --> 00:16:04,322
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't pull media strings.

260
00:16:05,573 --> 00:16:07,574
[SPEAKER_04]: It was actually, I tried, it's too late.

261
00:16:07,855 --> 00:16:08,075
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't.

262
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:11,077
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm trying to get us in for a panel next con.

263
00:16:11,317 --> 00:16:12,017
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, yes please.

264
00:16:12,037 --> 00:16:16,000
[SPEAKER_02]: I would totally Skype in, I know how con wifi is.

265
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,881
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, con wifi is a pain in the ass.

266
00:16:17,901 --> 00:16:20,283
[SPEAKER_03]: We'd love to have you, but that's why we're not live streaming.

267
00:16:20,523 --> 00:16:25,066
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to know why we aren't live streaming the panel, especially when we have big news to talk about, that's why.

268
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:26,887
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you cannot depend on hotel wifi.

269
00:16:27,308 --> 00:16:30,290
[SPEAKER_03]: Even though I'm sure they bring in the Uber stuff for DragonCon, which is a huge deal.

270
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:32,091
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

271
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:58,912
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of problems going on with Final Fantasy XIV's launch, which is really unfortunate, but they're having some severe network issues.

272
00:16:59,372 --> 00:17:15,656
[SPEAKER_03]: Once you get in the game, it's a fairly pleasant experience, except for the fact that the first day, instances weren't working, which usually in most MMOs isn't a big deal, except in Final Fantasy XIV, you have story instances you have to do about every five levels, and you go into solo instances and beat them.

273
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:26,507
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is fun, and it helps you learn about your character and so forth, but when the instance finder's down, that really sucks, because you can't progress your character past level 10, unless you had a character who was already higher level.

274
00:17:26,847 --> 00:17:30,091
[SPEAKER_04]: And don't forget about the fates lasting four times as long as normal.

275
00:17:30,191 --> 00:17:31,712
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so it's just a mess.

276
00:17:31,732 --> 00:17:33,214
[SPEAKER_04]: Which wasn't bad, it was a lot of experience.

277
00:17:33,414 --> 00:17:34,255
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

278
00:17:58,291 --> 00:17:58,732
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

279
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:20,393
[SPEAKER_03]: It really sucks that these network issues are taking away that attention from what is otherwise a great game.

280
00:18:20,413 --> 00:18:28,275
[SPEAKER_03]: And it really sucks that Square Enix wasn't a little better prepared for it, which every MMO has the same damn story.

281
00:18:28,575 --> 00:18:29,156
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

282
00:18:29,296 --> 00:18:33,937
[SPEAKER_02]: Every MMO has the same exact story when it comes to launching and servers being offline stuff.

283
00:18:33,977 --> 00:18:37,499
[SPEAKER_02]: So why did Microsoft think that they're going to be different?

284
00:18:38,499 --> 00:18:42,303
[SPEAKER_02]: with their whole online tie to, you know, consoles and stuff.

285
00:18:42,503 --> 00:18:43,103
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no, no.

286
00:18:43,424 --> 00:18:45,425
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's going to screw that up, but we won't.

287
00:18:45,706 --> 00:18:46,626
[SPEAKER_02]: We won't screw it up.

288
00:18:46,646 --> 00:18:47,207
[SPEAKER_04]: Microsoft?

289
00:18:47,848 --> 00:18:55,795
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, because he's saying with the Xbox One, you know, and we were saying at the time, we said, look at what happened to Diablo 3, look at what happened to SimCity.

290
00:18:55,955 --> 00:18:59,038
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, just add Final Fantasy 14 to that list.

291
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:03,281
[SPEAKER_02]: SimCity, perfect example of like, well, we saw what happened with Diablo 3 and

292
00:19:04,102 --> 00:19:06,043
[SPEAKER_02]: We're taking precautions to make sure that doesn't happen.

293
00:19:06,543 --> 00:19:08,964
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, you just cursed yourself, you stupid idiot.

294
00:19:09,964 --> 00:19:13,225
[SPEAKER_03]: No matter who you are, these situations are going to keep happening.

295
00:19:13,545 --> 00:19:23,608
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the first Final Fantasy XIV version 1.0 was such a stinker that they probably were legitimately not expecting this many people from North America to give it a second chance.

296
00:19:24,008 --> 00:19:28,430
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's amazing and speaks to the quality of the game that people are giving it a second chance.

297
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:31,152
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

298
00:19:49,025 --> 00:20:12,885
[SPEAKER_03]: so he's you know he's a great guy and you know is is also a nerd as well as doing sports ball for a living and sticks up for all this stuff well he was writing these tweets this weekend very angry and he was so mad he couldn't even redeem his code for Final Fantasy 14 that he did a charge back on buying the game you know which wow yeah I know it's kind of a dick thing to do but I get it but there's probably a lot of people out there that are feeling kind of ripped off and it kind of

299
00:20:13,405 --> 00:20:15,848
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

300
00:20:33,246 --> 00:20:33,947
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we get around that?

301
00:20:33,987 --> 00:20:38,670
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the thing is, that's why Microsoft's pushing the whole Azure server thing.

302
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:43,795
[SPEAKER_02]: It's basically virtual servers, so they can scale them back pretty fast.

303
00:20:44,935 --> 00:20:51,981
[SPEAKER_02]: Virtual servers, so basically they can scale them back pretty fast when it does die off instead of having all this hardware that they're running.

304
00:20:52,001 --> 00:20:55,904
[SPEAKER_02]: They're running a bunch of virtual machines, and so there's that.

305
00:20:56,545 --> 00:21:00,488
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe something like that would help, and then that way...

306
00:21:02,029 --> 00:21:14,813
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a hard balancing game because you don't want to buy too many servers or have too many of them running because you're not going to need them past launch once that kind of evens out.

307
00:21:15,253 --> 00:21:25,015
[SPEAKER_02]: So you deal with spending less money up front and having people kind of be a little bit pissed about it for two weeks and then leveling off and everybody kind of forgetting about it.

308
00:21:26,856 --> 00:21:31,137
[SPEAKER_02]: Or you spend a lot of money and have everybody be happy but you're out all that extra money up

309
00:21:31,577 --> 00:21:32,117
[SPEAKER_02]: and DarkSakura.com.

310
00:22:01,615 --> 00:22:30,659
[SPEAKER_03]: I think what has to happen is that a lot of MMOs at this point really need to kind of challenge themselves on the multiple server way of thinking that a lot of MMOs do and I see some MMOs and I think Guild Wars and I'm even thinking back to the original Guild Wars is a great example of this kind of has the and you see Warcraft moving towards this too with their whole servers that they're talking about the virtual servers where we need to really like you might be on a different box you might be playing on a different machine but

311
00:22:30,839 --> 00:22:54,327
[SPEAKER_03]: but it's one world it's one world and you are phased to the people that you want to play with and so forth like Guild Wars did this you go into the city and you could pick which one of the 50 different copies of the city do you want to be in and then when you go out in the world you're in your own little instance and I think that was a good way to kind of challenge the traditional you're on your server and you don't leave those servers and if you want to change servers 25 bucks kind of way of thinking

312
00:22:54,887 --> 00:23:00,492
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's just dumb anyways because copying a file across the server Well, that's World of Warcraft.

313
00:23:00,532 --> 00:23:01,913
[SPEAKER_03]: That's World of Warcraft right now.

314
00:23:02,574 --> 00:23:05,596
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like charging you $75 to put a cabin air filter in.

315
00:23:05,917 --> 00:23:07,038
[SPEAKER_02]: It takes like one second.

316
00:23:07,078 --> 00:23:11,842
[SPEAKER_04]: See, I hated the cross-server instances as well, which is one of the big reasons I quit.

317
00:23:12,583 --> 00:23:13,043
[SPEAKER_04]: Hated it.

318
00:23:13,724 --> 00:23:17,907
[SPEAKER_04]: I would rather be on one server with the people who I know are on one server.

319
00:23:19,108 --> 00:23:21,991
[SPEAKER_03]: But what if you have that one friend who's on another server?

320
00:23:22,051 --> 00:23:24,094
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the way WoW does it, I like that.

321
00:23:24,114 --> 00:23:24,674
[SPEAKER_04]: It was funny for Drew.

322
00:23:24,774 --> 00:23:27,377
[SPEAKER_04]: I hated when you're out in the world and it crossed server.

323
00:23:28,378 --> 00:23:28,999
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

324
00:23:29,019 --> 00:23:30,140
[SPEAKER_04]: I loathed it.

325
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:32,022
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that screwed up the crafting.

326
00:23:32,162 --> 00:23:34,144
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway, I don't... It screwed up everything.

327
00:23:34,404 --> 00:23:38,989
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to get too much into the WoW talk because, you know, I already have another show for a lot of that.

328
00:23:39,029 --> 00:23:40,551
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think this MMO stuff is good.

329
00:23:40,811 --> 00:23:43,732
[SPEAKER_04]: If I wanted to play cross-server, it was with someone I knew.

330
00:23:43,832 --> 00:23:46,493
[SPEAKER_04]: I could choose to play with somebody I wanted to play with.

331
00:23:46,773 --> 00:23:52,875
[SPEAKER_02]: They just need to put out the server program or whatever for Final Fantasy XI.

332
00:23:52,915 --> 00:23:53,675
[SPEAKER_02]: Just let it go.

333
00:23:54,356 --> 00:23:56,857
[SPEAKER_03]: You are dying to hack the crap out of that game.

334
00:23:56,877 --> 00:23:58,357
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to play that game.

335
00:23:58,377 --> 00:24:00,558
[SPEAKER_02]: Free-to-play would have been awesome for that.

336
00:24:01,098 --> 00:24:03,279
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got to go free-to-play or close pretty soon.

337
00:24:04,119 --> 00:24:04,559
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

338
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,322
[SPEAKER_03]: They just released an expansion.

339
00:24:07,382 --> 00:24:10,765
[SPEAKER_03]: The very last PlayStation 2 game ever made was a Final Fantasy XI expansion.

340
00:24:11,305 --> 00:24:16,350
[SPEAKER_03]: They have to... They don't have to do anything.

341
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:18,352
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't have to do shit.

342
00:24:18,452 --> 00:24:19,653
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't have to do a damn thing.

343
00:24:20,894 --> 00:24:22,775
[SPEAKER_03]: They have to die and pay taxes.

344
00:24:22,875 --> 00:24:23,296
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

345
00:24:25,029 --> 00:24:25,429
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow.

346
00:24:25,789 --> 00:24:29,211
[SPEAKER_04]: Even then, you know, corporations get out of the taxes.

347
00:24:30,032 --> 00:24:30,332
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

348
00:24:31,652 --> 00:24:37,635
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get into how was your gamey week and specifically what types of games have you been playing this week besides XIV and all that?

349
00:24:37,675 --> 00:24:38,736
[SPEAKER_03]: What other games have you been playing?

350
00:24:38,756 --> 00:24:39,336
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.

351
00:24:39,997 --> 00:24:45,479
[SPEAKER_04]: Fractal, Dragon Age 2, Mass Effect 3, and Animal Crossing.

352
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,241
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there something going on with a Dragon Age renaissance?

353
00:24:48,261 --> 00:24:50,542
[SPEAKER_03]: Because Alan's been really into Dragon Age this week, too.

354
00:24:51,118 --> 00:24:51,378
[SPEAKER_04]: Dragon Age 2

355
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:10,461
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, yeah, I wasn't super impressed with it.

356
00:25:10,501 --> 00:25:11,081
[SPEAKER_04]: It was okay.

357
00:25:11,121 --> 00:25:16,243
[SPEAKER_04]: I might go back and play Origins and Awakenings, but I just wanted to finish it.

358
00:25:16,283 --> 00:25:20,064
[SPEAKER_04]: That, and you know, while there was server maintenance going on, I was like, okay, I'll just play something else.

359
00:25:20,524 --> 00:25:21,484
[SPEAKER_04]: I really didn't care.

360
00:25:21,624 --> 00:25:22,905
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't had the energy to care.

361
00:25:23,805 --> 00:25:27,306
[SPEAKER_04]: So, it's like, when one thing goes down, well, it's not like I don't have 50,000 other things to play.

362
00:25:27,546 --> 00:25:29,927
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the way a lot of people should look at it.

363
00:25:30,407 --> 00:25:39,971
[SPEAKER_03]: And not to dig up the old topic we just left, but I will say, like most things in gaming, a month from now, who's going to remember all this fuckery?

364
00:25:40,832 --> 00:25:41,832
[SPEAKER_03]: Very few people.

365
00:25:42,172 --> 00:25:45,514
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we'll still remember it, but we won't be angry about it.

366
00:25:45,534 --> 00:25:47,554
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll be past it, because you'll all be busy playing the game.

367
00:25:47,755 --> 00:25:50,056
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, remember when PlayStation 3 was hacked?

368
00:25:50,876 --> 00:25:55,698
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember when Xbox 360 took all those people's money through the EA games?

369
00:25:56,278 --> 00:26:01,705
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember all these things that happened that we just kind of... Remember when they... You know, just Red Ring.

370
00:26:01,725 --> 00:26:02,306
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

371
00:26:03,936 --> 00:26:06,138
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember when Diablo 3 launched and it was shit?

372
00:26:06,638 --> 00:26:07,119
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey!

373
00:26:07,459 --> 00:26:11,222
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of which, Diablo 3 launches in a couple weeks.

374
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:12,223
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you think that's going to do?

375
00:26:12,243 --> 00:26:13,324
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it's going to do very well.

376
00:26:13,464 --> 00:26:14,906
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't seem pretty popular so far.

377
00:26:15,166 --> 00:26:17,248
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not a whole ton coming out in September, remember?

378
00:26:17,308 --> 00:26:22,332
[SPEAKER_02]: There's Grand Theft Auto, and then FIFA, and Diablo.

379
00:26:23,153 --> 00:26:23,853
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty much it.

380
00:26:25,255 --> 00:26:26,035
[SPEAKER_02]: Rayman, I guess.

381
00:26:26,316 --> 00:26:30,239
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's probably going to be the second biggest game of the month.

382
00:26:32,361 --> 00:26:34,122
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie, was there anything else you wanted to say about your gaming week?

383
00:26:35,163 --> 00:26:35,603
[SPEAKER_04]: Not really.

384
00:26:35,943 --> 00:26:38,805
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, I didn't mean to deviate from it too much, but you were having a sneezy.

385
00:26:38,905 --> 00:26:42,227
[SPEAKER_04]: No, actually, I think something might have set off my allergies worse.

386
00:26:42,927 --> 00:26:43,868
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope it wasn't the kitty.

387
00:26:44,088 --> 00:26:44,849
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think it's the kitty.

388
00:26:45,369 --> 00:26:46,249
[SPEAKER_03]: Can't be anything in here.

389
00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:49,171
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it the stuff I used to vacuum earlier, maybe?

390
00:26:49,271 --> 00:26:49,651
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think so.

391
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:52,453
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, but it's now getting into my eyes.

392
00:26:52,673 --> 00:26:53,433
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, I feel better.

393
00:26:53,894 --> 00:26:55,975
[SPEAKER_03]: If you need to go outside for a minute or something, do it.

394
00:26:56,275 --> 00:26:57,680
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

395
00:27:03,092 --> 00:27:09,096
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com FifthDream says, I want the Diablo 3 expansion a lot.

396
00:27:09,116 --> 00:27:10,397
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be talking about that in a little bit.

397
00:27:10,757 --> 00:27:13,299
[SPEAKER_03]: DungeonBuster says, the trailer for that looks nice.

398
00:27:14,059 --> 00:27:18,082
[SPEAKER_03]: Codeman says, never forget Final Fantasy XIV, A Realm Reborn.

399
00:27:18,382 --> 00:27:21,544
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, honestly, Codeman, you could probably insert any other MMO in there.

400
00:27:21,885 --> 00:27:22,685
[SPEAKER_03]: Every MMO.

401
00:27:22,845 --> 00:27:23,646
[SPEAKER_03]: Every single one of them.

402
00:27:23,666 --> 00:27:25,007
[SPEAKER_04]: Never forget Ragnarok Online.

403
00:27:25,087 --> 00:27:27,989
[SPEAKER_03]: And Square Enix would probably want you to forget about Final Fantasy XIV.

404
00:27:28,089 --> 00:27:29,090
[SPEAKER_03]: Take one.

405
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:29,870
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

406
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:30,971
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

407
00:27:31,431 --> 00:27:36,638
[SPEAKER_03]: The smoothest MMO launch I probably played was probably actually Guild Wars 2.

408
00:27:37,399 --> 00:27:38,200
[SPEAKER_03]: I will give them credit.

409
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,302
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a pretty smooth launch.

410
00:27:40,583 --> 00:27:42,185
[SPEAKER_03]: But it still had its share of problems.

411
00:27:42,505 --> 00:27:45,308
[SPEAKER_02]: Defiance wasn't so bad, but that's also because no one was playing it.

412
00:27:47,371 --> 00:27:48,913
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, Loki, how was your gaming week?

413
00:27:49,586 --> 00:27:51,728
[SPEAKER_02]: I only played Saints Row 4 this week.

414
00:27:52,708 --> 00:28:00,273
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually started off playing the Xbox 360 version, but then once my Steam version unlocked, I just went ahead and finished up and played on that.

415
00:28:00,413 --> 00:28:03,355
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm pretty much... I'm almost 100% complete.

416
00:28:04,576 --> 00:28:10,060
[SPEAKER_02]: I have just one mission left, so I've been finishing up all the activities, and I'm almost gold in everything.

417
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,962
[SPEAKER_02]: I have all the collectibles collected, and I have...

418
00:28:15,203 --> 00:28:16,423
[SPEAKER_02]: Almost all the activity is done.

419
00:28:16,644 --> 00:28:21,425
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a few more that have the gold that I had silver on, but I'll probably be done with it today.

420
00:28:23,246 --> 00:28:25,967
[SPEAKER_02]: Which brings me to more about the game.

421
00:28:26,427 --> 00:28:29,268
[SPEAKER_02]: A little pseudo-review, if you will.

422
00:28:30,822 --> 00:28:31,723
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

423
00:28:50,686 --> 00:29:04,293
[SPEAKER_02]: and then as you get to the point where you're finding more of your crew members, you're taking them out of the simulation and you're starting to do the loyalty missions and stuff, it's where they start actually getting pretty creative with the actual missions and stuff.

424
00:29:04,313 --> 00:29:05,694
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's some pretty funny stuff in there.

425
00:29:06,234 --> 00:29:11,937
[SPEAKER_02]: There is one with Asha where it's a whole rip on Metal Gear Solid.

426
00:29:12,377 --> 00:29:13,057
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there's...

427
00:29:15,779 --> 00:29:20,683
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole point in there is like, okay, in this section, we're going to need to shoot at the lights.

428
00:29:21,263 --> 00:29:22,945
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we're going to have to take out the guard.

429
00:29:23,325 --> 00:29:23,565
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

430
00:29:24,186 --> 00:29:24,506
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

431
00:29:24,806 --> 00:29:26,347
[SPEAKER_02]: Now this is going to be completely different.

432
00:29:26,708 --> 00:29:29,770
[SPEAKER_02]: What I'm going to need you to do is I need you to shoot at the lights.

433
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:31,711
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of funny.

434
00:29:32,152 --> 00:29:32,692
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that.

435
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:42,680
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there was a mission with Pierce where they do a duet with – is it the song –

436
00:29:46,325 --> 00:29:47,485
[SPEAKER_02]: Opposites Attract or whatever.

437
00:29:47,986 --> 00:29:48,746
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, the Paula Abdul song?

438
00:29:48,766 --> 00:29:49,546
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's Paula Abdul.

439
00:29:50,267 --> 00:29:53,708
[SPEAKER_02]: So they do that and they also sing some other songs on the radio.

440
00:29:54,169 --> 00:30:02,073
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's like that part right there kind of made me smile because that's the part where they're kind of getting down to what made the game as good.

441
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:03,433
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like the personality in the game.

442
00:30:03,813 --> 00:30:12,098
[SPEAKER_02]: But a lot of the throughout the whole missions and stuff that this love letter to the fans is basically like, hey, remember how cool Saints Row 2 was?

443
00:30:13,118 --> 00:30:13,679
[SPEAKER_02]: and that's it.

444
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,024
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, hey, remember how cool Saints Row 2 was?

445
00:30:16,264 --> 00:30:17,206
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, remember this guy?

446
00:30:17,366 --> 00:30:21,154
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember how you really did this really fucked up thing to get him back?

447
00:30:21,374 --> 00:30:23,759
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember how crazy shit was back in that?

448
00:30:25,286 --> 00:30:26,507
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

449
00:30:47,941 --> 00:30:49,282
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

450
00:31:10,810 --> 00:31:33,145
[SPEAKER_02]: or they're just reskins of weapons that were in other games and also what's up with you know them saying hey we're not going to have these missions where we're basically going to have you do the activities and kind of force you to do that no actually all that's in there in fact the last bits of the loyalty missions you have to do for your crew members are all the fucking activities in the game that's all it is they didn't even bother to think up new missions they just like

451
00:31:33,405 --> 00:31:35,686
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, do this fucking activity because we developed it.

452
00:31:35,926 --> 00:31:48,391
[SPEAKER_02]: And the fact that they're basing a lot of these activities off of, what is it, Cyberblazing, which was in Saints Row the Third, which I think was the worst activity in the whole fucking game, and now they have a whole bunch based off of that.

453
00:31:48,611 --> 00:31:49,832
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just kind of annoying.

454
00:31:50,432 --> 00:31:51,773
[SPEAKER_02]: But the game is still good.

455
00:31:51,993 --> 00:32:01,757
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just it's sad because they remind you about how great the series was, and there are some moments that are still great, but it's kind of...

456
00:32:02,937 --> 00:32:04,799
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of like just going through the paces again.

457
00:32:04,819 --> 00:32:12,424
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not trying too hard, it seems like, because it's the same world.

458
00:32:12,685 --> 00:32:13,986
[SPEAKER_02]: It's based off the same engine.

459
00:32:14,006 --> 00:32:16,668
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they tweaked some stuff, but the superpowers are fucking from the...

460
00:32:17,591 --> 00:32:20,393
[SPEAKER_02]: They were from the expansion for Saints Row 3rd.

461
00:32:20,793 --> 00:32:21,514
[SPEAKER_02]: Saints Row 3rd.

462
00:32:21,794 --> 00:32:23,996
[SPEAKER_02]: The superpowers were from Troubled Clones.

463
00:32:24,696 --> 00:32:25,777
[SPEAKER_02]: They're exactly the same.

464
00:32:25,817 --> 00:32:27,999
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just kind of built upon that.

465
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:29,720
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my problem with it.

466
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:38,247
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just... I don't see... I mean, there's going to be replayability because the PC version and the modding community is going to be great on it and stuff.

467
00:32:38,707 --> 00:32:42,570
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just been out for a little bit and they already have some pretty cool stuff available already, but...

468
00:32:44,256 --> 00:32:47,437
[SPEAKER_02]: Story-wise, I hope the last mission's really good.

469
00:32:47,537 --> 00:32:51,579
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I'm hoping, but I just think it's going to be kind of a letdown.

470
00:32:51,799 --> 00:33:01,883
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank God they brought Gat back, because it's very clear once you rescue him and you're actually playing with him in some of the other missions, it's like, why the hell did they kill that guy off?

471
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:04,324
[SPEAKER_02]: And the way they explained how he came back is brilliant.

472
00:33:04,544 --> 00:33:05,065
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that.

473
00:33:05,645 --> 00:33:07,046
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was just...

474
00:33:08,546 --> 00:33:21,750
[SPEAKER_02]: Once again, it's like, okay, he was a great part of Saints Row 2, and that's kind of why you need him back in the game, because it's going to be hard to figure out where they go for the fifth game from here.

475
00:33:21,770 --> 00:33:24,971
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to have to scale it back, and I hope that they find a happy medium with number two.

476
00:33:25,131 --> 00:33:31,913
[SPEAKER_03]: When I'm listening to you kind of talk about your disappointment with it, I almost feel like you're saying that you kind of feel like it's still...

477
00:33:37,675 --> 00:33:52,559
[SPEAKER_03]: and that oh my gosh it's not really going to be a full game most people I've heard talk about it say that was really unfounded because they really did all this different stuff with the game and you do get that full game experience but the way you talk about it you make it sound like it is more of an expansion

478
00:33:53,199 --> 00:33:56,982
[SPEAKER_02]: It does seem like... I mean, there's a lot of... There's content in there.

479
00:33:57,942 --> 00:33:59,623
[SPEAKER_02]: There's missions that are pretty unique.

480
00:34:00,344 --> 00:34:05,707
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I'll give them that because... And they do stand out quite well from everything else.

481
00:34:06,108 --> 00:34:12,091
[SPEAKER_02]: But a lot of it is just kind of in there just because, like, you know...

482
00:34:15,316 --> 00:34:20,520
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of the stuff that they explain in the game is because you were hacking the simulation.

483
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:26,724
[SPEAKER_02]: But the minigames in there and the activities that they have you do kind of don't make any sense.

484
00:34:27,684 --> 00:34:35,430
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, yeah, I understand it's not supposed to make a ton of sense, but it really doesn't make any sense why it's in there other than it's a thing to do.

485
00:34:35,830 --> 00:34:39,252
[SPEAKER_02]: Why do I have to go in the simulation and throw balls at targets?

486
00:34:39,853 --> 00:34:39,913
[SPEAKER_02]: Or...

487
00:34:41,254 --> 00:34:45,436
[SPEAKER_02]: Why do I have to run along this path and collect glowing orbs and stuff?

488
00:34:45,996 --> 00:34:47,557
[SPEAKER_02]: Why do I have to... Why not?

489
00:34:47,617 --> 00:34:48,518
[SPEAKER_02]: It worked in Crackdown.

490
00:34:49,198 --> 00:34:49,859
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

491
00:34:50,099 --> 00:34:51,119
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the problem, too.

492
00:34:51,319 --> 00:34:55,682
[SPEAKER_02]: They took so much inspiration, if you will, from Crackdown.

493
00:34:55,822 --> 00:34:57,243
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fucking Crackdown.

494
00:34:57,743 --> 00:34:58,884
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got the superpowers.

495
00:34:59,044 --> 00:35:00,325
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the problem with that?

496
00:35:00,485 --> 00:35:02,006
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody wants another Crackdown.

497
00:35:02,026 --> 00:35:06,448
[SPEAKER_02]: Crackdown got pretty boring after... Well, Crackdown didn't really have a single-player narrative to it.

498
00:35:06,648 --> 00:35:08,589
[SPEAKER_02]: It was basically like a, go here, kill guy.

499
00:35:08,729 --> 00:35:09,530
[SPEAKER_02]: Go here, kill guy.

500
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:11,492
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

501
00:35:29,770 --> 00:35:30,611
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, come on.

502
00:35:30,931 --> 00:35:31,571
[SPEAKER_03]: It's ridiculous.

503
00:35:44,406 --> 00:35:49,907
[SPEAKER_03]: You've played to 93% completion, so there must be something you really like about this.

504
00:35:50,207 --> 00:35:55,808
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the game and I want to get it done with so I can play Grand Theft Auto V. I've got to finish it before Grand Theft Auto V comes out.

505
00:35:55,828 --> 00:35:57,028
[SPEAKER_02]: Get this out of here.

506
00:35:57,108 --> 00:35:58,308
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got other things to do.

507
00:35:58,589 --> 00:35:59,009
[SPEAKER_02]: It's sad.

508
00:35:59,089 --> 00:36:03,489
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the game, but it feels very rushed.

509
00:36:03,549 --> 00:36:12,051
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know that the team at Volition is great and they worked on stuff, but I feel that they've done so much better work in the past

510
00:36:12,631 --> 00:36:15,992
[SPEAKER_02]: that, come on, there should be no excuse for this kind of stuff.

511
00:36:16,732 --> 00:36:20,414
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I just don't know.

512
00:36:20,494 --> 00:36:31,618
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, it's very, like, I understand what they were trying to do with it, but it just doesn't, maybe it's at the point now where they're like, well, crap, we've got to go crazier for, you know, the fourth game.

513
00:36:32,478 --> 00:36:33,358
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we do that?

514
00:36:33,478 --> 00:36:34,679
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, we're going to do superpowers.

515
00:36:34,839 --> 00:36:37,840
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, now, and then it's like, okay, well, we've got to think of a new weapon.

516
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:41,141
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got to be really crazy because people are expecting crazy.

517
00:36:41,161 --> 00:36:41,241
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

518
00:36:41,821 --> 00:36:49,886
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the problem, is I think they've gotten stuck in that now, where everything has to be so over the top, and like, ooh, it's a cliche of this, ooh, it's a play on that.

519
00:36:50,727 --> 00:37:02,655
[SPEAKER_02]: Just, I think what they need to do, it's going to be interesting when they have that expansion, the first expansion come out, because they did something similar with Skyrim, the Skyrim team did, where it's like, okay, here's a week, develop something that you want to do.

520
00:37:03,275 --> 00:37:06,418
[SPEAKER_02]: and we'll put it in the game later on or we'll try to figure out a way for it.

521
00:37:06,498 --> 00:37:12,764
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where a lot of the great content from Skyrim came from was that kind of like almost like internal game jam type thing.

522
00:37:13,184 --> 00:37:17,508
[SPEAKER_02]: And I really wish that that's what they would do for the fifth game where just put some good ideas together.

523
00:37:17,648 --> 00:37:21,352
[SPEAKER_02]: It would have been really cool for number four because it is a simulation.

524
00:37:21,992 --> 00:37:26,914
[SPEAKER_02]: Take chunks from Stillwater and Steelport and just smash it all together.

525
00:37:27,234 --> 00:37:30,976
[SPEAKER_02]: Just take shit from that old map and the Steelport map.

526
00:37:31,176 --> 00:37:38,940
[SPEAKER_02]: That would have at least made it different and interesting as opposed to just, okay, we're just going to dump the same map in there and throw some alien shit in the air and call it a day.

527
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:39,820
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

528
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,261
[SPEAKER_03]: Going to our chat room with some comments.

529
00:37:41,301 --> 00:37:42,581
[SPEAKER_03]: Live.VogNetwork.com.

530
00:37:42,621 --> 00:37:46,243
[SPEAKER_03]: ShadowNextGen says, the homages in Saints Row 4 are amazing.

531
00:37:46,963 --> 00:37:49,104
[SPEAKER_03]: I still have to finish the game, so I can't write a review yet.

532
00:37:49,124 --> 00:37:51,205
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't finished, I haven't done the last mission yet.

533
00:37:51,225 --> 00:37:51,785
[SPEAKER_03]: Fair enough.

534
00:37:51,805 --> 00:37:55,167
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm hoping that it just, you know, brings it all back, you know, but we'll see.

535
00:38:10,194 --> 00:38:13,216
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you can do She-Ra, but I know that they have the Rainbow Brite costume.

536
00:38:13,236 --> 00:38:13,357
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

537
00:38:37,145 --> 00:38:38,786
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty amazing as well, I gotta say.

538
00:38:38,806 --> 00:38:46,050
[SPEAKER_02]: But they do have the Thundercats thing where it's like... That's what I love about... Oh, I'm sorry.

539
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:46,850
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead.

540
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:48,391
[SPEAKER_02]: One other real quick gripe.

541
00:38:48,471 --> 00:38:50,833
[SPEAKER_02]: And this goes back to just game design and everything.

542
00:38:51,453 --> 00:38:56,155
[SPEAKER_02]: They have three different things that are assigned to the left and right directional pad.

543
00:38:56,836 --> 00:39:03,780
[SPEAKER_02]: Left and right directional pad are for selecting your abilities, your super abilities that you're using, or...

544
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:11,323
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, for changing your radio station, and also for doing a taunt or compliment.

545
00:39:12,224 --> 00:39:17,146
[SPEAKER_02]: All of those have to do with, like, touch the button, hold the button for a little bit, or hold the button for a long time.

546
00:39:17,386 --> 00:39:18,747
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fucking stupid.

547
00:39:19,207 --> 00:39:21,809
[SPEAKER_02]: It's because, like, half the time, oh, I'm trying to do a taunt.

548
00:39:22,049 --> 00:39:23,670
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'm sorry, I changed the radio station.

549
00:39:23,830 --> 00:39:25,210
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no, I changed my superpower.

550
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:26,491
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, like, dumb.

551
00:39:26,611 --> 00:39:28,072
[SPEAKER_02]: That is completely stupid.

552
00:39:28,752 --> 00:39:28,972
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

553
00:39:29,213 --> 00:39:30,113
[SPEAKER_03]: But they have a lot of this.

554
00:39:30,414 --> 00:39:33,537
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I really love about Saints Row is all this over the top shit.

555
00:39:33,737 --> 00:39:35,499
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I need to check it out at some point.

556
00:39:35,519 --> 00:39:37,201
[SPEAKER_02]: They do have a lot of cool costumes in there.

557
00:39:37,321 --> 00:39:40,745
[SPEAKER_02]: So it'll be interesting to see what other stuff that they add on with DLC.

558
00:39:40,765 --> 00:39:42,006
[SPEAKER_02]: So far, they haven't gone crazy yet.

559
00:39:42,306 --> 00:39:42,567
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

560
00:39:43,267 --> 00:39:44,869
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll quickly talk about my gaming week.

561
00:39:45,229 --> 00:39:50,195
[SPEAKER_03]: I've already talked ad nauseum about Final Fantasy 14, which honestly has been the majority of my time as the game is new.

562
00:39:50,595 --> 00:40:14,667
[SPEAKER_03]: but there is at least one other game I checked out this week on PlayStation 3 and this was partially a listener recommendation I want to say I don't remember who it was I don't remember if it was in chat or an email I apologize I just remember seeing it on the store and I was like oh yeah somebody told me I should get that and play that so I did download Tekken Revolution which is the free-to-play Tekken game that was that's on the PlayStation 3 now I don't know why I had it in my mind

563
00:40:15,487 --> 00:40:19,309
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know why I thought that, but I did.

564
00:40:20,069 --> 00:40:21,930
[SPEAKER_03]: I downloaded it, and it's totally not.

565
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:26,131
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe that's where I'm crossing wires or something.

566
00:40:26,151 --> 00:40:27,512
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway, it's not.

567
00:40:27,652 --> 00:40:28,713
[SPEAKER_03]: It has nothing to do with cards.

568
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:33,715
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a straight-up fighting game, just like it was Tekken 7 or something on the consoles.

569
00:40:34,835 --> 00:40:38,757
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's a free-to-play game, which is weird, but I...

570
00:40:40,478 --> 00:40:43,779
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually really enjoyed it, come to think of it.

571
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:57,326
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it was free, and the way that they make their money is that you can play either, I think it's like you can do five player versus player matches, or two versus computer matches before you run out of energy.

572
00:40:57,767 --> 00:41:05,951
[SPEAKER_03]: But the computer matches are like arcade style, so if you win, you get to play again and again and again until you get up to like a boss that you kill, like seven people in.

573
00:41:06,551 --> 00:41:34,917
[SPEAKER_03]: and each time you win a match you get a little bit of cash you get a little bit of experience a little bit of these gift points the gift points you end up unlocking characters later on or so I hear I guess it takes a lot to do it because I haven't done it yet the money you can use to up the stats on your character for when you go fight later matches so either now I know I'm not that good at fighting games because I was about to say either I'm really good at fighting games but I know that's not the case

574
00:41:35,797 --> 00:41:36,798
[SPEAKER_03]: Martial Law Arcade Mode Normal

575
00:41:55,854 --> 00:41:56,634
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

576
00:42:14,941 --> 00:42:38,326
[SPEAKER_03]: a five round match because it's like two out of three and it went the full five rounds like they were equally matched with me and I was very impressed at that especially for a free game so if you like fighting games and you like Tekken why the fuck not it's free now here's how they get your money if you want to play more you got to buy tokens that you can use to play more matches later on

577
00:42:38,926 --> 00:42:41,769
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's little ways that they nickel and dime you in that regard.

578
00:42:41,829 --> 00:42:56,502
[SPEAKER_03]: But as far as a Facebook game on the PlayStation 3, but said Facebook game is like a Tekken 6 or something like that, even though I didn't really care for Tekken 6, but you know, if Tekken 6 had been free, I would have downloaded it and played it still and enjoyed it.

579
00:42:56,582 --> 00:42:58,363
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, yeah.

580
00:42:59,184 --> 00:43:03,007
[SPEAKER_03]: I gotta say, I was pretty impressed by this little free-to-play fighter.

581
00:43:03,848 --> 00:43:04,509
[SPEAKER_03]: Overall...

582
00:43:05,229 --> 00:43:08,331
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been pretty impressed with the free-to-play offerings on PlayStation 3.

583
00:43:09,471 --> 00:43:11,172
[SPEAKER_03]: Jetpack Joyride's pretty good too.

584
00:43:11,573 --> 00:43:12,773
[SPEAKER_03]: There's another one I checked out.

585
00:43:13,233 --> 00:43:26,260
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, honestly, if you're bored and don't really have anything to play right now, or maybe you can't afford to get a new game right now, or just nothing looks appealing to you, go look at what's free on PlayStation 3, because there's some pretty decent stuff.

586
00:43:26,621 --> 00:43:26,861
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean...

587
00:43:27,441 --> 00:43:36,043
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not going to be as amazing as The Last of Us or these other big AAA titles that are out right now, but it'll entertain you for a little while.

588
00:43:36,583 --> 00:43:39,824
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, even if you have PlayStation Plus, it's even better.

589
00:43:39,864 --> 00:43:44,325
[SPEAKER_02]: They announced during Gamescom, Assassin's Creed 3 is coming out later this year as free.

590
00:43:44,805 --> 00:43:45,505
[SPEAKER_02]: That's crazy.

591
00:43:45,545 --> 00:43:46,546
[SPEAKER_02]: That came out last year.

592
00:43:46,566 --> 00:43:48,726
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, crazy.

593
00:43:48,906 --> 00:43:50,987
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the Hitman game was just out last year, too.

594
00:43:51,707 --> 00:43:52,067
[SPEAKER_03]: Crazy.

595
00:43:52,588 --> 00:43:53,909
[SPEAKER_03]: Saints Row the Third, if you haven't played it yet.

596
00:43:54,149 --> 00:43:54,929
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so.

597
00:43:56,110 --> 00:44:00,514
[SPEAKER_03]: ShadowNextGen in chat says, Speaking of free-to-play, Plants vs. Zombies 2 is awesome.

598
00:44:00,674 --> 00:44:03,656
[SPEAKER_03]: I gotta put that on my queue because I've been wanting to try that.

599
00:44:03,856 --> 00:44:05,017
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't been able to try that yet.

600
00:44:06,418 --> 00:44:09,981
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really the only new game I can think of to talk about this week is Plants vs. Zombies.

601
00:44:11,021 --> 00:44:11,502
[SPEAKER_03]: Excuse me.

602
00:44:12,182 --> 00:44:13,423
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what the chatter can think about.

603
00:44:13,443 --> 00:44:16,425
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the only new game I can think to talk about otherwise is Tekken Revolution.

604
00:44:16,906 --> 00:44:17,106
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

605
00:44:17,588 --> 00:44:18,008
[SPEAKER_03]: Good times.

606
00:44:18,769 --> 00:44:19,069
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

607
00:44:20,050 --> 00:44:20,950
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's move on.

608
00:44:21,811 --> 00:44:22,432
[SPEAKER_03]: Housekeeping.

609
00:44:22,472 --> 00:44:25,854
[SPEAKER_03]: I pretty much already talked about what I wanted to talk about as far as DragonCon and so forth.

610
00:44:26,374 --> 00:44:30,097
[SPEAKER_03]: The only other thing I'll say for housekeeping is that remember there is no live show next week.

611
00:44:30,477 --> 00:44:32,779
[SPEAKER_03]: So enjoy your week off for Labor Day, whatever you're doing.

612
00:44:32,799 --> 00:44:33,299
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a dead show.

613
00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:35,381
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a dead show next week.

614
00:44:35,661 --> 00:44:43,947
[SPEAKER_04]: And before I forget, given that we will not have a show next week, I would like to wish my fellow individuals of the Jewish Persuasion, Lashana Tova, Happy New Year.

615
00:44:44,708 --> 00:44:44,828
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

616
00:44:45,188 --> 00:44:45,628
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

617
00:44:46,468 --> 00:44:48,469
[SPEAKER_03]: Any Labor Day greetings to give the listener?

618
00:44:48,569 --> 00:44:50,250
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a Labor Day greeting.

619
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:52,131
[SPEAKER_03]: That time of year, you know what I mean?

620
00:44:52,471 --> 00:44:53,371
[SPEAKER_03]: My dad's birthday.

621
00:44:53,411 --> 00:44:54,671
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish my dad a happy birthday.

622
00:44:55,412 --> 00:44:56,892
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the birthday of September 2nd.

623
00:44:58,593 --> 00:45:00,213
[SPEAKER_03]: You doing anything over the holiday, Loki?

624
00:45:00,233 --> 00:45:01,234
[SPEAKER_03]: You going to barbecue or anything?

625
00:45:01,254 --> 00:45:05,936
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to go to my dad's for dinner on Saturday, I think.

626
00:45:05,956 --> 00:45:06,476
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

627
00:45:09,297 --> 00:45:09,857
[SPEAKER_02]: That's about it.

628
00:45:10,884 --> 00:45:12,145
[SPEAKER_03]: How about you, DarkSakura?

629
00:45:12,805 --> 00:45:13,966
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to be busy being Jewish.

630
00:45:14,666 --> 00:45:15,607
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing wrong with that.

631
00:45:16,667 --> 00:45:19,288
[SPEAKER_03]: Say hi to your synagogue friends.

632
00:45:19,568 --> 00:45:21,469
[SPEAKER_04]: To the Jew crew, as Dan calls them.

633
00:45:21,489 --> 00:45:22,530
[SPEAKER_04]: Dan calls them the Jew crew.

634
00:45:22,950 --> 00:45:29,473
[SPEAKER_02]: Ideally, Grand Theft Auto V would have leaked out by then, but I can't make any guarantees there.

635
00:45:29,854 --> 00:45:31,234
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some fun people in the Jew crew.

636
00:45:31,254 --> 00:45:32,595
[SPEAKER_03]: When are we getting some of them back on the show?

637
00:45:33,072 --> 00:45:36,254
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, but we had a really rousing game of Cards Against Humanity.

638
00:45:36,314 --> 00:45:36,454
[SPEAKER_03]: I bet.

639
00:45:36,474 --> 00:45:40,696
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was the first time that, except for me, that any of us had played the game.

640
00:45:41,537 --> 00:45:42,297
[SPEAKER_04]: It was very fun.

641
00:45:43,077 --> 00:45:43,378
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

642
00:45:44,378 --> 00:45:47,260
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're getting some New Year wishes back there in the chat room from SHA100, Matt.

643
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:47,660
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

644
00:45:48,220 --> 00:45:48,760
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

645
00:45:48,961 --> 00:45:49,341
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

646
00:45:49,441 --> 00:45:53,343
[SPEAKER_04]: And Yom Kippur is on the 16th, and I will be busy fasting all day.

647
00:45:54,423 --> 00:45:55,204
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that on a Sunday?

648
00:45:56,144 --> 00:45:56,384
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

649
00:45:56,645 --> 00:45:58,367
[SPEAKER_04]: If it was on a Sunday, I wouldn't be here.

650
00:45:59,368 --> 00:46:00,349
[SPEAKER_04]: I tell you in advance.

651
00:46:01,230 --> 00:46:03,253
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to put up with a Jamie who hasn't eaten.

652
00:46:03,533 --> 00:46:05,256
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually all day on Saturday.

653
00:46:05,276 --> 00:46:06,197
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's on a Saturday.

654
00:46:08,359 --> 00:46:08,660
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow.

655
00:46:10,202 --> 00:46:10,983
[SPEAKER_03]: No show next week.

656
00:46:12,144 --> 00:46:13,146
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm at DragonCon.

657
00:46:13,486 --> 00:46:14,687
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're going to PAX...

658
00:46:15,328 --> 00:46:31,620
[SPEAKER_03]: Extrofer from Horde House will be there so keep an eye out for him he will be our lone VOG representative at PAX because his partner has family in Seattle so that was the better option for him to go kind of make a trip out of that so they're off to PAX whereas the rest of us are DragonCon

659
00:46:32,601 --> 00:46:33,902
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, let's move on.

660
00:46:34,163 --> 00:46:35,004
[SPEAKER_03]: Time for gaming news.

661
00:46:35,104 --> 00:46:37,506
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was quite a bit of it this week with Gamescom and all that, right, Loki?

662
00:46:37,646 --> 00:46:39,228
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, lots of big announcements.

663
00:46:39,768 --> 00:46:44,573
[SPEAKER_02]: Sony came through with what they said they were planning on doing, which was announcing their release plans.

664
00:46:44,693 --> 00:46:45,534
[SPEAKER_02]: And so with that...

665
00:46:46,004 --> 00:46:46,904
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

666
00:47:03,590 --> 00:47:05,412
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

667
00:47:24,210 --> 00:47:47,333
[SPEAKER_02]: Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK, and I guess Latin America, also Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Mexico, Panama, and Peru.

668
00:47:49,094 --> 00:47:52,117
[SPEAKER_02]: and the US or North America as well, obviously.

669
00:47:53,338 --> 00:47:53,718
[SPEAKER_02]: And Japan.

670
00:47:54,439 --> 00:47:54,859
[SPEAKER_02]: Can't forget.

671
00:47:55,219 --> 00:47:56,620
[SPEAKER_03]: Although no date for Japan yet, right?

672
00:47:57,941 --> 00:48:02,986
[SPEAKER_03]: WhatUpG in chat says, Sony has a press event in September probably to announce the Japanese PlayStation 4 date.

673
00:48:03,006 --> 00:48:04,367
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's Tokyo Game Show.

674
00:48:04,787 --> 00:48:06,328
[SPEAKER_03]: Would that mean maybe later?

675
00:48:06,628 --> 00:48:07,649
[SPEAKER_03]: That they get it later?

676
00:48:07,669 --> 00:48:11,071
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm thinking that they're probably going to be, it's going to be around the same time.

677
00:48:11,271 --> 00:48:13,733
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be later, but I think it's probably... Because that's not usual.

678
00:48:13,793 --> 00:48:15,314
[SPEAKER_03]: PlayStation 3, they got it earlier.

679
00:48:15,334 --> 00:48:16,955
[SPEAKER_03]: And I want to say PlayStation 2, they did too.

680
00:48:17,075 --> 00:48:23,239
[SPEAKER_02]: They could launch, you know, between that time or like, you know, it's going to be around the same time, I think.

681
00:48:23,620 --> 00:48:24,820
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, probably in November still.

682
00:48:25,401 --> 00:48:25,581
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm.

683
00:48:26,061 --> 00:48:26,381
[SPEAKER_03]: Alrighty.

684
00:48:27,642 --> 00:48:28,503
[SPEAKER_03]: But, uh, yeah.

685
00:48:30,094 --> 00:48:32,797
[SPEAKER_03]: I did not get to watch the Sony press conference.

686
00:48:32,897 --> 00:48:35,059
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you watched it, but what did you think of it?

687
00:48:35,619 --> 00:48:36,300
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was good.

688
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:39,443
[SPEAKER_02]: It was very reminiscent of E3.

689
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:47,610
[SPEAKER_02]: It was weird in the beginning because they basically had someone on stage playing the PlayStation 4 and showing kind of the interface and stuff.

690
00:48:47,950 --> 00:48:50,833
[SPEAKER_02]: Also kind of showing that, hey, we're pretty much done with this thing.

691
00:48:51,013 --> 00:48:52,835
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, it's ready to go.

692
00:48:52,855 --> 00:48:53,655
[SPEAKER_02]: That's good, though.

693
00:48:53,835 --> 00:48:54,596
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, that's good.

694
00:48:54,696 --> 00:48:59,841
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, definitely we're going to get into a lot more of it.

695
00:48:59,881 --> 00:49:02,483
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, still focused on, like, indie stuff.

696
00:49:02,503 --> 00:49:04,085
[SPEAKER_02]: They announced some new IPs.

697
00:49:05,406 --> 00:49:10,190
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, talked more about release dates for different things like, you know, Gran Turismo and stuff.

698
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:13,153
[SPEAKER_02]: And then showed off a lot of the things that, like,

699
00:49:14,313 --> 00:49:18,115
[SPEAKER_02]: Just kind of pulled a few punches still against CM Microsoft.

700
00:49:19,656 --> 00:49:21,997
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, there was a big sick burn at the end, wasn't there?

701
00:49:22,418 --> 00:49:23,178
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a couple, yeah.

702
00:49:23,378 --> 00:49:28,761
[SPEAKER_03]: Something about the whole like, and while others have changed their message... I'm going from memory here, this is an exact quote.

703
00:49:29,141 --> 00:49:34,204
[SPEAKER_03]: While where others have changed their messages, we have stayed consistent with our... There was definitely a little...

704
00:49:34,944 --> 00:49:36,226
[SPEAKER_03]: The Shade Throne.

705
00:49:36,286 --> 00:49:39,771
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody brought the umbrella to the Sony press conference to make some shade.

706
00:49:39,911 --> 00:49:43,617
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it was interesting.

707
00:49:44,277 --> 00:49:48,463
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, this is a fun time of year because you know who's the winner in this scenario when these two companies are fighting?

708
00:49:48,704 --> 00:49:49,365
[SPEAKER_03]: Us, the gamers.

709
00:49:51,078 --> 00:50:18,370
[SPEAKER_03]: hopefully yeah Loki you look a little skeptical at that comment uh yeah we're the winners I think all right all right well let's get into some of those specifics that Loki mentioned a minute ago um here's one about uh and I believe they've announced something similar to this on the Microsoft platform so uh this is you know just kind of meeting the challenge here I think this is through PlayStation Network and I think a lot of it though they're talking more like retailer stuff like Amazon and GameStop doing something similar

710
00:50:18,530 --> 00:50:18,790
[SPEAKER_03]: Gotcha.

711
00:50:18,830 --> 00:50:19,851
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, here's what we're talking about.

712
00:50:19,891 --> 00:50:22,031
[SPEAKER_03]: The discount upgrade program.

713
00:50:22,251 --> 00:50:23,392
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what we're talking about here.

714
00:50:24,092 --> 00:50:39,758
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently, there will be a program where if you buy these games on the PlayStation 3, and these are select games, not necessarily everything, but select games, you'll have the ability to upgrade to the PlayStation 4 version for a, here's my quotey fingers, significantly discounted price.

715
00:50:40,765 --> 00:50:43,928
[SPEAKER_03]: Call of Duty Ghosts, Assassin's Creed 4, Black Flag, Watch Dogs, Battlefield 4

716
00:51:03,526 --> 00:51:28,552
[SPEAKER_03]: Activision and Warner Brothers also publishers that are partnering with Sony on this initiative the upgrade initiative do not know yet if it's a worldwide initiative but certainly for North America at least and if Japan's getting something similar I'm sure that will be detailed at Tokyo Game Show now some other details here even though I just said expect $20 discounts Call of Duty Ghosts has said $10 not $10 off $10 off

717
00:51:32,639 --> 00:51:33,440
[SPEAKER_03]: Call of Duty Ghosts

718
00:51:52,580 --> 00:51:58,841
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would think who this is going to most apply to are the people that are just like, not this year for the PlayStation 4.

719
00:51:59,402 --> 00:52:07,343
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to get their PlayStation 4s in 2014, you know, when some more software comes out, when next year's holiday lineup starts coming out.

720
00:52:07,943 --> 00:52:12,324
[SPEAKER_03]: That's when people want to upgrade their games, but this program is not going to be available by then, right, Loki?

721
00:52:12,344 --> 00:52:12,905
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

722
00:52:13,225 --> 00:52:18,906
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't really see a time frame, and I think it's more of like, let's play it by ear and see what happens and...

723
00:52:19,566 --> 00:52:38,921
[SPEAKER_02]: you know it's all gonna be because why would you purchase you know Call of Duty Ghosts and then two weeks later you're gonna get your PlayStation 4 or whatever and oh and I gotta buy the PlayStation 4 version as well it's like you would think that you would just kind of wait it out a little bit yeah but I mean I understand you know

724
00:52:39,681 --> 00:52:48,788
[SPEAKER_03]: I can also see folks that are going to have PlayStation 4s under their Christmas trees or their menorahs or whatever you celebrate in the winter season, right?

725
00:52:49,448 --> 00:52:54,912
[SPEAKER_03]: That you might end up with a PlayStation 4 there when you've bought all these PlayStation 3 games.

726
00:52:55,473 --> 00:52:58,015
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm kind of like, if you're going to buy a bunch of PlayStation 3 games...

727
00:53:00,905 --> 00:53:01,325
[SPEAKER_03]: and DarkSakura.

728
00:53:25,598 --> 00:53:33,223
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, now Sony wanted to be clear that these upgrade prices, such as the one that we just mentioned for Call of Duty Ghosts, they are going to be set by the publisher.

729
00:53:33,263 --> 00:53:34,964
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not something Sony is going to regulate.

730
00:53:35,024 --> 00:53:40,687
[SPEAKER_03]: A little bit of a clarification here from UK Managing Director Fergal Gara in an interview with Digital Spy.

731
00:53:41,047 --> 00:53:41,327
[SPEAKER_03]: Quote,

732
00:53:42,788 --> 00:53:50,970
[SPEAKER_03]: is the PlayStation 4 digital file will be made available on the PlayStation Store as it would be anyway at launch and the PS3 discs will be sold through retail.

733
00:53:51,310 --> 00:54:04,052
[SPEAKER_03]: What the consumer can then do for a premium to be defined by the publisher is access the PlayStation 4 digital game and then provided they still have the PlayStation 3 disc, they will be able to play the PlayStation 4 version when they decide to buy the next gen.

734
00:54:04,292 --> 00:54:10,053
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a pretty clever solution because that doesn't allow you to like game fly your PS3 game and then upgrade it.

735
00:54:10,553 --> 00:54:19,618
[SPEAKER_03]: if your PS3 disc is in the drive you can use the PlayStation 4 digital version that's a clever little way to do it yeah

736
00:54:21,192 --> 00:54:21,612
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all.

737
00:54:21,652 --> 00:54:22,893
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't got anything to say.

738
00:54:22,973 --> 00:54:24,354
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a clever little workaround.

739
00:54:26,195 --> 00:54:30,477
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's not that much different than, let's say, the Xbox 360.

740
00:54:30,797 --> 00:54:35,520
[SPEAKER_03]: You install a game to your hard drive on the 360, you still require the disk and the drive, right?

741
00:54:36,060 --> 00:54:40,522
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we're seeing that bridging between two systems, which is kind of neat.

742
00:54:40,922 --> 00:54:45,805
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially in light of the fact that the PlayStation 4 is not backwards compatible, which is frustrating to some people.

743
00:54:45,845 --> 00:54:51,688
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm wondering if that would work different than... Well, obviously it would work different if you bought a digital version of the game, I guess.

744
00:54:53,608 --> 00:54:54,529
[SPEAKER_02]: You wouldn't have to do that.

745
00:54:56,370 --> 00:54:58,130
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well let's move on with some more news.

746
00:54:58,511 --> 00:54:58,951
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.

747
00:55:00,831 --> 00:55:01,071
[SPEAKER_03]: Twitch

748
00:55:23,210 --> 00:55:24,812
[SPEAKER_04]: It was at GamersCon.

749
00:55:24,893 --> 00:55:29,841
[SPEAKER_04]: They basically said that players would be able to broadcast over Twitch channels.

750
00:55:30,342 --> 00:55:32,846
[SPEAKER_04]: So there goes the need for a capture card.

751
00:55:32,866 --> 00:55:34,208
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll just be doing it online.

752
00:55:34,228 --> 00:55:35,750
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is pretty cool.

753
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:37,940
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

754
00:55:58,212 --> 00:56:02,676
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but Twitch is a very popular streaming solution for people.

755
00:56:03,397 --> 00:56:10,244
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, in fact, there isn't a lot of competition out there to Twitch, which really surprises me, meaning like focused on video game.

756
00:56:10,264 --> 00:56:10,825
[SPEAKER_03]: I know there's others.

757
00:56:10,865 --> 00:56:14,689
[SPEAKER_03]: I've heard of one called Owned, but nothing on that same scale of Twitch.

758
00:56:15,210 --> 00:56:15,370
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

759
00:56:16,611 --> 00:56:19,872
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm seeing this type of stuff kind of break through on the mainstream media too.

760
00:56:19,992 --> 00:56:28,974
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I was seeing something on either CNN or Yahoo or one of those sites where they were talking about, you know, more people watch Twitch TV than some basic cable channels.

761
00:56:30,115 --> 00:56:30,355
[SPEAKER_03]: True.

762
00:56:31,615 --> 00:56:35,116
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's very much a new medium or new media.

763
00:56:35,536 --> 00:56:44,419
[SPEAKER_03]: And now everybody's going to get to do their own broadcast right from their PlayStation 4 or their Xbox One to be fair, which is detailed a similar plan.

764
00:56:44,439 --> 00:56:44,939
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's cool.

765
00:56:45,379 --> 00:56:45,559
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

766
00:56:46,155 --> 00:56:47,357
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

767
00:57:02,856 --> 00:57:04,317
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I kind of wish that there was a way.

768
00:57:04,397 --> 00:57:08,880
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'm not too familiar with all the export options that they have available.

769
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:16,684
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, if you can export those files, like you can... Because I know they have the sharing stuff that you can do where you can share clips online.

770
00:57:16,945 --> 00:57:22,508
[SPEAKER_02]: But I wonder if you can, like, export a huge file or something to, like, YouTube or export it to your computer and edit it.

771
00:57:22,988 --> 00:57:26,852
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's saving to the Twitch website, you can export Twitch videos to YouTube.

772
00:57:26,892 --> 00:57:31,877
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a Let's Play the Slender Man where I screamed very high-pitched when I saw Slender Man.

773
00:57:31,937 --> 00:57:35,280
[SPEAKER_03]: That's on my YouTube, which is Rob Roberts Plays, I think, on my YouTube channel.

774
00:57:35,741 --> 00:57:37,002
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was an export from Twitch.

775
00:57:37,344 --> 00:57:42,147
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this whole thing bodes well for Twitch itself, just given that they're also going to have the Xbox deal too.

776
00:57:42,567 --> 00:57:43,607
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, this is huge for them.

777
00:57:44,108 --> 00:57:49,330
[SPEAKER_03]: And remember, Twitch started as, and they still run it, Justin.TV, which was streaming your life.

778
00:57:50,211 --> 00:57:55,313
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think in some ways, I'm just going to give you guys real talk from my perspective.

779
00:57:55,333 --> 00:57:59,836
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Justin.TV kind of became a joke in some ways because it kind of became a lot of cam whores.

780
00:58:00,436 --> 00:58:06,922
[SPEAKER_03]: and people that were like, you know, pay me $5 and I'll show you my titty or show you my junk or whatever.

781
00:58:07,302 --> 00:58:12,327
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of what, even though you're not supposed to have adult content, that's what a lot of that life casting turned into.

782
00:58:12,687 --> 00:58:25,279
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's really great that those guys kind of thought ahead and, you know, kind of grabbed on this gaming thing that was going on that was a little more, you know, a little more serious, I guess.

783
00:58:26,380 --> 00:58:26,520
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

784
00:58:27,580 --> 00:58:27,860
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

785
00:58:28,940 --> 00:58:30,341
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, I plan to use this.

786
00:58:30,361 --> 00:58:31,101
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be fun.

787
00:58:31,441 --> 00:58:38,022
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'll definitely check it out, especially since I finally got around to playing around with my video capture equipment, the new stuff.

788
00:58:39,343 --> 00:58:43,324
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the stuff I might be capturing with the brand new Twitch feature on PlayStation 4.

789
00:58:44,404 --> 00:58:47,325
[SPEAKER_02]: Minecraft is a big surprise.

790
00:58:47,385 --> 00:58:49,185
[SPEAKER_02]: This was something that was kind of...

791
00:58:50,506 --> 00:58:54,068
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a very quick reveal.

792
00:58:54,168 --> 00:58:58,031
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't really show anything other than a logo and some people walking by in costume.

793
00:58:58,491 --> 00:59:00,733
[SPEAKER_02]: And not even really costume, but with a mask on.

794
00:59:01,093 --> 00:59:05,036
[SPEAKER_02]: But yes, Minecraft will be coming to the PlayStation 4 at launch.

795
00:59:05,677 --> 00:59:07,998
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's also coming to PlayStation 3 and the Vita.

796
00:59:08,819 --> 00:59:09,699
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're...

797
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:22,408
[SPEAKER_02]: I gotta say, internet, seriously, people on Twitter, don't harass the Xbox support people regarding, like, announcements and shit.

798
00:59:22,748 --> 00:59:37,298
[SPEAKER_02]: Xbox support is for helping people with shit that's wrong on your Xbox, not saying, Hey, I see Minecraft, you know, which was, you know, originally a console exclusive for Xbox 360, it's coming to PlayStation 4, how do you like them apples?

799
00:59:37,338 --> 00:59:38,239
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that type of shit.

800
00:59:39,244 --> 00:59:51,067
[SPEAKER_02]: Technically, if you want to get into it there, yes, Microsoft has an exclusive on Minecraft, the Xbox 360 edition, and Minecraft, the Xbox One edition.

801
00:59:51,568 --> 00:59:56,869
[SPEAKER_02]: Minecraft on the PlayStation 4 will be created by yet a different company other than 4J Studios.

802
00:59:57,269 --> 01:00:07,092
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, yes, it will be technically exclusive to PlayStation 4, whereas a different version of Minecraft is exclusive to the Xbox platforms.

803
01:00:07,512 --> 01:00:08,212
[SPEAKER_02]: There, you're done.

804
01:00:08,312 --> 01:00:11,733
[SPEAKER_02]: Stop emailing those people or stop tweeting to them.

805
01:00:12,233 --> 01:00:18,155
[SPEAKER_02]: And yes, they're saying that it's created by Microsoft Studios, so therefore it is exclusive to Xbox.

806
01:00:18,175 --> 01:00:20,695
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, their version of the game is exclusive to Xbox.

807
01:00:20,755 --> 01:00:26,377
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Bobby Blackwolf in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com kind of echoing the same sentiment there.

808
01:00:26,457 --> 01:00:29,938
[SPEAKER_03]: Microsoft Xbox 360 Edition is still an Xbox 360 exclusive.

809
01:00:30,118 --> 01:00:30,838
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, exactly.

810
01:00:31,738 --> 01:00:35,639
[SPEAKER_02]: I would be interested to see what differences there are in it.

811
01:00:35,859 --> 01:00:38,200
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it would be very interesting to see that.

812
01:00:40,281 --> 01:00:41,301
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, so there's that.

813
01:00:41,401 --> 01:00:46,183
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, of course, other wonderful console exclusives.

814
01:00:47,763 --> 01:00:56,646
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is basically talking a little bit about the indie games because they were a big focus on the presentation.

815
01:00:57,106 --> 01:01:24,065
[SPEAKER_02]: and some of their exclusives they're saying are going to be Hotline Miami 2, N++, Starbound, let's see, Volume, which is done by the guy that did Thomas Was Alone, Rogue Legacy, Wasteland Kings, and Everybody's Gone Through the Rapture, which I love the parody account, was it the Kazurai parody account who said, yeah, it's a sequel to Everybody's Golf.

816
01:01:24,365 --> 01:01:25,065
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

817
01:01:26,246 --> 01:01:26,686
[SPEAKER_02]: A little dark.

818
01:01:27,026 --> 01:01:27,946
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

819
01:01:28,066 --> 01:01:28,547
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's that.

820
01:01:28,587 --> 01:01:29,867
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, of course, other things.

821
01:01:30,367 --> 01:01:35,668
[SPEAKER_02]: The Binding of Isaac Rebirth, Velocity 2X, and Guns of Icarus Online.

822
01:01:37,669 --> 01:01:40,249
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess Velocity, I think it was Velocity.

823
01:01:41,030 --> 01:01:41,810
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it wasn't Velocity.

824
01:01:41,830 --> 01:01:47,551
[SPEAKER_02]: There's another game they announced free that was going to be available for PlayStation 4 with PlayStation Plus.

825
01:01:47,631 --> 01:01:52,873
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're going to get quite a lineup of free games, especially indie titles, at launch.

826
01:01:53,793 --> 01:01:54,653
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be interesting.

827
01:01:55,259 --> 01:02:01,783
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well, this is a little awkward, but these things happen, especially in live radio.

828
01:02:02,243 --> 01:02:05,225
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we're going to say goodbye to Jamie for now, right?

829
01:02:05,485 --> 01:02:11,609
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, basically the allergy thing is getting to the point where I'm now lightheaded.

830
01:02:11,669 --> 01:02:14,991
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, but you are safe to drive, because I don't want you leaving here if you can't drive.

831
01:02:15,031 --> 01:02:18,653
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you can go lie down in the other room if you need to during the show.

832
01:02:18,954 --> 01:02:24,237
[SPEAKER_04]: If I do it now, I'll be okay, but I know how my...

833
01:02:25,017 --> 01:02:26,057
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

834
01:02:49,502 --> 01:02:50,543
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that we just gave away a secret.

835
01:03:12,001 --> 01:03:12,902
[SPEAKER_03]: It's alright, no, it's fine.

836
01:03:12,922 --> 01:03:16,645
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, no, we'd been out drinking all night, and I crashed out on her bed.

837
01:03:16,985 --> 01:03:18,966
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I came out, of course, fully sober.

838
01:03:20,307 --> 01:03:20,808
[SPEAKER_04]: Excuse me.

839
01:03:21,989 --> 01:03:26,712
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I smell where it had been lit in the front room.

840
01:03:27,013 --> 01:03:28,894
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I went and threw up everything.

841
01:03:28,954 --> 01:03:29,234
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.

842
01:03:29,615 --> 01:03:31,476
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, we can reminisce another time.

843
01:03:31,916 --> 01:03:33,437
[SPEAKER_03]: Take care of yourself, for heaven's sake.

844
01:03:33,718 --> 01:03:34,618
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

845
01:03:34,718 --> 01:03:35,399
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, kids.

846
01:03:35,639 --> 01:03:36,800
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for the well wishes.

847
01:03:37,900 --> 01:03:40,581
[SPEAKER_03]: Any last minute thoughts?

848
01:03:40,981 --> 01:04:06,205
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I realized what made myself worse I brought the one thing I thought would be quick and easy to cook and that was Pollock Paneer The Trader Joe's ones uses chilies and I have a super bad chili allergy so that's probably my own fault Allergy plus allergy equals super allergy Yeah I've got tea at home and I've got lots of Benadryl and Sudafed and NyQuil so I might pass out either that or you'll see me in chat

849
01:04:06,673 --> 01:04:06,933
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

850
01:04:06,973 --> 01:04:08,274
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we hope to hear from you later.

851
01:04:08,335 --> 01:04:09,355
[SPEAKER_03]: Feel better, for heaven's sake.

852
01:04:09,876 --> 01:04:12,658
[SPEAKER_03]: And such is the risk of doing live radio.

853
01:04:12,718 --> 01:04:14,760
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki and I will hold down the fort here for the rest of the night.

854
01:04:14,900 --> 01:04:15,421
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, guys.

855
01:04:15,461 --> 01:04:15,681
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

856
01:04:15,701 --> 01:04:16,182
[SPEAKER_03]: Drive safe.

857
01:04:16,822 --> 01:04:21,667
[SPEAKER_03]: If you need me, call my phone, and I will make sure my ringer is on.

858
01:04:22,908 --> 01:04:24,269
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you need me, call me.

859
01:04:24,849 --> 01:04:27,432
[SPEAKER_04]: You can have your 3DS charger back now.

860
01:04:27,592 --> 01:04:28,212
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fine.

861
01:04:28,232 --> 01:04:28,613
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

862
01:04:29,393 --> 01:04:29,754
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

863
01:04:31,124 --> 01:04:31,624
[SPEAKER_03]: Back to it.

864
01:04:31,764 --> 01:04:34,365
[SPEAKER_03]: AlanAlchemy in chat says, Mark down that timestamp.

865
01:04:34,405 --> 01:04:35,145
[SPEAKER_03]: That's an edit.

866
01:04:35,465 --> 01:04:37,326
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's live and it's funny.

867
01:04:38,586 --> 01:04:42,308
[SPEAKER_03]: SSJ100Matt says, Everyone's allergies change after several years.

868
01:04:44,028 --> 01:04:44,388
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

869
01:04:44,829 --> 01:04:48,070
[SPEAKER_03]: Tigerclaw in chat says, Sky, isn't everyone allergic to marijuana?

870
01:04:48,130 --> 01:04:49,110
[SPEAKER_03]: It smells so bad.

871
01:04:50,470 --> 01:04:50,951
[SPEAKER_03]: Trust me.

872
01:04:51,031 --> 01:04:58,133
[SPEAKER_03]: I know some people that if they're allergic to marijuana, then they are gluttons for punishment because plenty of it.

873
01:04:59,298 --> 01:05:02,139
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, did I tell you about how I found out I had an allergy to it?

874
01:05:02,159 --> 01:05:04,280
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a girl's bathroom at school.

875
01:05:06,260 --> 01:05:12,663
[SPEAKER_04]: And all the other bathrooms were being cleaned, so I went to the front bathroom that was by the office, which ironically is the one that everyone smokes pot in.

876
01:05:14,223 --> 01:05:19,365
[SPEAKER_04]: And I got in there, and I was so sick in the stall that I had to turn around and throw up.

877
01:05:19,505 --> 01:05:20,505
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I had a rash.

878
01:05:20,845 --> 01:05:21,165
[SPEAKER_03]: No fun.

879
01:05:21,505 --> 01:05:22,146
[SPEAKER_04]: On my face.

880
01:05:22,826 --> 01:05:23,346
[SPEAKER_04]: It was awful.

881
01:05:23,426 --> 01:05:23,946
[SPEAKER_03]: No fun at all.

882
01:05:24,006 --> 01:05:24,246
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

883
01:05:24,266 --> 01:05:25,387
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to be okay?

884
01:05:25,567 --> 01:05:25,847
[SPEAKER_03]: You sure?

885
01:05:26,187 --> 01:05:26,447
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

886
01:05:27,067 --> 01:05:27,307
[SPEAKER_03]: Drive safe.

887
01:05:27,327 --> 01:05:27,988
[SPEAKER_04]: Love you guys.

888
01:05:28,048 --> 01:05:28,348
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye.

889
01:05:28,568 --> 01:05:28,828
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

890
01:05:30,478 --> 01:05:32,060
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

891
01:05:47,279 --> 01:05:49,900
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, the music, man.

892
01:05:50,300 --> 01:05:51,240
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no, hold on.

893
01:05:51,260 --> 01:05:56,302
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet you that there's quite a few marijuana-inspired levels in LittleBigPlanet.

894
01:05:57,022 --> 01:06:01,344
[SPEAKER_02]: I guarantee that there's like, hey, I'm going to totally put pot leaves everywhere.

895
01:06:01,824 --> 01:06:04,905
[SPEAKER_02]: In this level, you've got to get stowed.

896
01:06:05,745 --> 01:06:15,669
[SPEAKER_03]: If there's a level dedicated to, what was her name, that actress, Parker Posey, that was my favorite LittleBigPlanet level I ever played was the Parker Posey level.

897
01:06:16,370 --> 01:06:20,018
[SPEAKER_03]: Which was like creepy stalker almost, but I loved it.

898
01:06:20,139 --> 01:06:20,419
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

899
01:06:20,439 --> 01:06:22,003
[SPEAKER_03]: So.

900
01:06:24,306 --> 01:06:32,092
[SPEAKER_03]: LittleBigPlanet Hub is a free-to-play service coming to the PlayStation 3 that's going to have many elements of the LittleBigPlanet universe.

901
01:06:32,752 --> 01:06:41,699
[SPEAKER_03]: LittleBigPlanet Hub will allow players to collaborate with online teammates for challenges, level creation, wardrobe coordination via a redesigned shop interface.

902
01:06:42,620 --> 01:06:48,284
[SPEAKER_03]: LittleBigPlanet Hub is said to offer unrestricted access to LittleBigPlanet's Create Mode.

903
01:06:49,264 --> 01:06:52,206
[SPEAKER_03]: 16 levels taken from previous LittleBigPlanet games on the PlayStation 3.

904
01:06:52,926 --> 01:06:58,289
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the hub-exclusive Team Picks will highlight a new batch of community-created levels every week.

905
01:06:58,609 --> 01:07:02,271
[SPEAKER_03]: And the new weekly challenges mode boasts a whole new way to play LittleBigPlanet.

906
01:07:02,291 --> 01:07:05,353
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm curious if that's going to have access to all the levels that are created out there.

907
01:07:05,373 --> 01:07:08,234
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if that's the case, then you probably don't need a single-player version of the game.

908
01:07:08,254 --> 01:07:11,815
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, and also, it does sound like, though, they might nickel and dime some of the content.

909
01:07:11,875 --> 01:07:18,318
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, because, you know, in the create mode in the games, you have to unlock that by playing the single player mode.

910
01:07:18,378 --> 01:07:18,898
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, sure, yeah.

911
01:07:19,438 --> 01:07:26,340
[SPEAKER_03]: So, it's like, if you want to, you know, you can create these levels, but if you want to use the grappling hook gun, you're going to have to buy that.

912
01:07:26,781 --> 01:07:29,582
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to use, you know, I think that's how they're going to do it.

913
01:07:29,622 --> 01:07:35,123
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll be able to make very basic levels, but you won't be able to make the really good stuff without buying some of the nickel and dime levels.

914
01:07:35,143 --> 01:07:35,744
[SPEAKER_02]: But I understand.

915
01:07:36,124 --> 01:07:36,424
[SPEAKER_02]: Great play.

916
01:07:36,764 --> 01:07:37,825
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you need?

917
01:07:37,885 --> 01:07:38,606
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep, free to play.

918
01:07:38,946 --> 01:07:40,627
[SPEAKER_03]: Allows you to get your foot in the door.

919
01:07:40,887 --> 01:07:45,511
[SPEAKER_03]: But if I'm not mistaken, LittleBigPlanet 2 is still a PlayStation Plus title, right?

920
01:07:46,142 --> 01:07:46,543
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

921
01:07:46,823 --> 01:07:47,083
[SPEAKER_02]: No?

922
01:07:47,244 --> 01:07:47,564
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it was.

923
01:07:47,584 --> 01:07:48,645
[SPEAKER_02]: LittleBigPlanet Cardiness.

924
01:07:48,925 --> 01:07:49,086
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah.

925
01:07:49,926 --> 01:07:50,627
[SPEAKER_02]: Gotcha.

926
01:07:50,928 --> 01:07:54,211
[SPEAKER_02]: But LittleBigPlanet 2 right now, it's gotta be dirt cheap.

927
01:07:54,672 --> 01:07:57,635
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's been a long time since it's been out.

928
01:07:57,695 --> 01:07:58,456
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, so.

929
01:07:58,956 --> 01:07:59,116
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

930
01:07:59,257 --> 01:07:59,737
[SPEAKER_02]: Should be alright.

931
01:08:00,378 --> 01:08:00,718
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

932
01:08:01,259 --> 01:08:03,261
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so League of Legends.

933
01:08:03,661 --> 01:08:03,902
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

934
01:08:05,684 --> 01:08:06,384
[SPEAKER_02]: They got hacked.

935
01:08:07,365 --> 01:08:18,135
[SPEAKER_02]: And apparently there was info that was accessed and that includes usernames, email addresses, salted passwords, and credit card numbers as well.

936
01:08:18,575 --> 01:08:30,045
[SPEAKER_02]: But once again, those were salted, which means they're encrypted and they have some random stuff thrown in there as well to make it difficult to unencrypt it.

937
01:08:30,465 --> 01:08:36,814
[SPEAKER_02]: So while that stuff was leaked out, you probably just want to change your login and password information because that's pretty much the only thing that they do have access to.

938
01:08:37,415 --> 01:08:45,886
[SPEAKER_02]: And you obviously, you know, if you use the same login and password combination on other sites, it's going to be the first thing they try.

939
01:08:46,927 --> 01:08:48,049
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure you change that stuff.

940
01:08:48,149 --> 01:09:03,145
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't worry too much about the credit card information and the billing information stuff because that stuff was encrypted and it looks like that it would be difficult for them to crack all that stuff.

941
01:09:03,505 --> 01:09:20,674
[SPEAKER_03]: but still never good to hear that again and League of Legends is a huge game too it's not good to hear that they got hacked now luckily I used a unique password for League of Legends because I just kind of thought something like this might happen but now I'm going to need a second unique password because they're going to make everybody change it I haven't logged in in a week though

942
01:09:22,096 --> 01:09:26,561
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they say that they're taking appropriate action to notify and safeguard affected players.

943
01:09:27,142 --> 01:09:31,587
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be contacting these players via email addresses currently associated with their accounts to alert them.

944
01:09:32,048 --> 01:09:36,473
[SPEAKER_02]: Our investigation is ongoing and we take all the necessary steps to protect players.

945
01:09:38,689 --> 01:09:39,029
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

946
01:09:39,469 --> 01:09:41,770
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you didn't have a League of Legends account, so you don't have to worry about it, right?

947
01:09:41,790 --> 01:09:42,470
[SPEAKER_02]: Nope, don't play it.

948
01:09:42,890 --> 01:09:43,950
[SPEAKER_02]: So, not a problem.

949
01:09:44,010 --> 01:09:44,670
[SPEAKER_03]: Lucky you.

950
01:09:44,851 --> 01:09:45,551
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, yep, yep.

951
01:09:45,591 --> 01:09:45,911
[SPEAKER_03]: Lucky you.

952
01:09:45,951 --> 01:09:50,532
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and what's coming out to a gaming store near you.

953
01:09:50,552 --> 01:09:51,512
[SPEAKER_02]: A few things this week.

954
01:09:51,832 --> 01:09:54,433
[SPEAKER_02]: Lost Planet 3 on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

955
01:09:55,753 --> 01:09:57,594
[SPEAKER_02]: Little known fact about Lost Planet 3.

956
01:09:58,094 --> 01:10:02,195
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think Capcom thinks it's going to do very well, so they're not making any reprints of it.

957
01:10:03,075 --> 01:10:05,716
[SPEAKER_02]: Once the launch quantities are gone, it's gone, apparently.

958
01:10:05,836 --> 01:10:06,216
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

959
01:10:06,837 --> 01:10:07,657
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't believe that, though.

960
01:10:07,677 --> 01:10:13,659
[SPEAKER_03]: If it were to do very well, which I kind of agree with Capcom in this regard, I don't think it will do very well, sorry.

961
01:10:14,820 --> 01:10:17,381
[SPEAKER_03]: But if it does, I mean, they could always just reprint it.

962
01:10:17,521 --> 01:10:17,981
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they could.

963
01:10:18,041 --> 01:10:21,942
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't that what they did with, like, Katamari Damacy and some of these other minimally printed games?

964
01:10:21,962 --> 01:10:28,705
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that a lot of that is just to get the buzz out there so that information gets out so they're like, oh, I need to get it because I won't be able to get it otherwise.

965
01:10:29,187 --> 01:10:35,169
[SPEAKER_02]: Final Fantasy XIV out this week on PC and PlayStation 3.

966
01:10:36,390 --> 01:10:41,172
[SPEAKER_02]: Killer is Dead on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 if you're a fan of Suda51.

967
01:10:41,332 --> 01:10:47,855
[SPEAKER_02]: Too bad Jamie left, but Hatsune Miku, Project Diva F on PlayStation 3 this week.

968
01:10:48,135 --> 01:10:51,036
[SPEAKER_02]: Should be excited about that.

969
01:10:51,056 --> 01:10:55,278
[SPEAKER_02]: Last but not least, Madden NFL 25 coming out.

970
01:10:56,158 --> 01:10:58,119
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and Painkiller, Hell and Damnation on PS3.

971
01:11:00,067 --> 01:11:09,157
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, let's travel to Japan and then maybe you can pick up the UK dates here that we would usually do because I'm trying to replace the classic game of the week here because I don't want to take Jamie's game.

972
01:11:09,697 --> 01:11:10,898
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm working frantically on that.

973
01:11:13,761 --> 01:11:14,942
[SPEAKER_03]: All while we're doing live radio.

974
01:11:15,743 --> 01:11:24,347
[SPEAKER_03]: So, trying to go to the Japanese release dates, and here they are on the PlayStation 3 this week on August the 27th.

975
01:11:24,407 --> 01:11:28,109
[SPEAKER_03]: Final Fantasy XIV makes its way to Japan as well.

976
01:11:28,149 --> 01:11:32,151
[SPEAKER_03]: The name there, Final Fantasy XIV Online, Shinsei Yorza.

977
01:11:32,831 --> 01:11:51,301
[SPEAKER_03]: and Eorza is the name of the realm that we all play in like Azeroth is in World of Warcraft so I'm assuming that is their own interpretation of what we have as the subtitle Realm Reborn that is out in Japan on the 27th as well on the 29th which I believe is Thursday which is a more typical release day there

978
01:11:52,221 --> 01:11:54,843
[SPEAKER_03]: End of Eternity, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure All-Star Battle, and Lost Planet 3.

979
01:11:55,223 --> 01:11:58,505
[SPEAKER_03]: Xbox 360 has Monster Hunter Frontier G Anniversary 2013 Premium Package.

980
01:12:15,035 --> 01:12:16,076
[SPEAKER_03]: Ragnarok Odyssey Ace Ragnarok Odyssey

981
01:12:38,594 --> 01:12:43,115
[SPEAKER_02]: Ace, I think, was one that was on DS or 3DS.

982
01:12:43,135 --> 01:12:45,956
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's a new re-release or something.

983
01:12:46,296 --> 01:12:47,736
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a re-release, but a port.

984
01:12:49,637 --> 01:12:52,057
[SPEAKER_03]: Sadly, no Wii U games this week.

985
01:12:52,677 --> 01:12:57,859
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw some Disney Infinity on my list, but I think some people over there are importing ours.

986
01:12:59,700 --> 01:13:00,720
[SPEAKER_03]: Disney is very popular in Japan.

987
01:13:00,841 --> 01:13:01,301
[SPEAKER_03]: I can imagine, yeah.

988
01:13:18,955 --> 01:13:45,847
[SPEAKER_03]: Nintendo 3DS gets Sherlock Holmes Puzzle City and Starry Sky in Autumn 3D in regular and limited edition and I was going to see real quick if there's anything on the PSP because believe it or not they still get releases there once in a while and Solomon's Ring Elemental Pack comes out on the Sony PSP I completely forgot actually on the PSP this week Sweet Fuse At Your Side I think is the name and that's a PSP title coming out over here huh

989
01:13:46,047 --> 01:13:47,888
[SPEAKER_02]: Visual Novel, Axis, go figure.

990
01:13:48,048 --> 01:13:48,448
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

991
01:13:48,989 --> 01:13:50,569
[SPEAKER_02]: Putting out those Visual Novel titles, man.

992
01:13:51,430 --> 01:13:54,231
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, just a couple more stories for you guys, and then the classic game of the week.

993
01:13:55,252 --> 01:13:55,692
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

994
01:13:55,792 --> 01:14:00,714
[SPEAKER_02]: In the UK, we're getting Castlevania Lords of Shadows, and this is on PC.

995
01:14:00,735 --> 01:14:01,915
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm assuming that's coming to Steam.

996
01:14:02,215 --> 01:14:05,077
[SPEAKER_02]: Final Fantasy XIV Realm Reborn on PlayStation 3 and PC.

997
01:14:06,217 --> 01:14:08,398
[SPEAKER_02]: Also on Mac, Bioshock Infinite.

998
01:14:08,438 --> 01:14:10,519
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe it's also coming out here as well on Steam.

999
01:14:10,899 --> 01:14:13,680
[SPEAKER_02]: Guardians of Middle-Earth, also a PC release.

1000
01:14:14,980 --> 01:14:18,742
[SPEAKER_02]: They're getting E3 and Odyssey 4, Legends of the Titan on 3DS.

1001
01:14:19,482 --> 01:14:22,163
[SPEAKER_02]: Killer is Dead on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

1002
01:14:22,643 --> 01:14:25,424
[SPEAKER_02]: Also Lost Planet 3 on Xbox 360.

1003
01:14:25,824 --> 01:14:28,485
[SPEAKER_02]: PlayStation 3 and PC, of course PC being on Steam.

1004
01:14:29,886 --> 01:14:35,811
[SPEAKER_02]: Rayman Legends actually coming out a little bit early over there on Wii U and PC, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3.

1005
01:14:37,152 --> 01:14:42,436
[SPEAKER_02]: And then some stuff that doesn't have a date on it, but it's just marked August.

1006
01:14:42,857 --> 01:14:45,239
[SPEAKER_02]: The Walking Dead 400 Days and Payday 2.

1007
01:14:45,299 --> 01:14:50,583
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure if that stuff's already been out yet, but it is over here, so... I don't know.

1008
01:14:51,960 --> 01:14:52,401
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

1009
01:14:53,262 --> 01:14:53,562
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1010
01:14:54,844 --> 01:14:58,849
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's talk a little bit about some other stuff that we discussed during the PlayStation conference.

1011
01:14:58,869 --> 01:15:03,576
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, a lot of this was leaked out beforehand, but the Vita got a price drop.

1012
01:15:03,596 --> 01:15:05,539
[SPEAKER_02]: $199 in the US and $199 in Europe.

1013
01:15:10,211 --> 01:15:18,218
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, it should be mentioned that the PlayStation 3 12GB system came out here as well because it is in Europe.

1014
01:15:18,939 --> 01:15:20,060
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's also $199.

1015
01:15:20,180 --> 01:15:23,303
[SPEAKER_02]: So PlayStation 3 and Vita for $199.

1016
01:15:23,943 --> 01:15:25,245
[SPEAKER_02]: And they actually do have a bundle too.

1017
01:15:26,305 --> 01:15:30,850
[SPEAKER_02]: The $199 price point is for the 3G one and they also have the Walking Dead.

1018
01:15:31,230 --> 01:15:32,231
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a bundle that's also $199 as well.

1019
01:15:32,251 --> 01:15:32,291
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

1020
01:15:33,632 --> 01:15:33,812
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um...

1021
01:16:01,089 --> 01:16:01,549
[SPEAKER_02]: Killzone.

1022
01:16:01,629 --> 01:16:02,370
[SPEAKER_02]: Killzone will be good.

1023
01:16:02,530 --> 01:16:04,451
[SPEAKER_02]: That's supposed to be actually a really good first-person shooter.

1024
01:16:05,752 --> 01:16:19,320
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard rumors that they may do a Vita version of Ghosts, but it would have to be somebody other than... I can't remember the developer, but the guys that did fucking Resistance and Call of Duty last year that just sucked.

1025
01:16:19,721 --> 01:16:20,721
[SPEAKER_02]: They were terrible.

1026
01:16:21,702 --> 01:16:24,964
[SPEAKER_02]: So as long as they get somebody else to develop that, it would be pretty good.

1027
01:16:25,024 --> 01:16:26,525
[SPEAKER_02]: Borderlands 2 is going to help too, so...

1028
01:16:27,626 --> 01:16:28,026
[SPEAKER_03]: Will it?

1029
01:16:28,227 --> 01:16:34,095
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I'm going to be honest, when I heard the news about Borderlands 2 on the Vita, I was kind of like, don't get me wrong, Borderlands 2, awesome game.

1030
01:16:34,615 --> 01:16:40,743
[SPEAKER_03]: I know people are really into it and rightfully so, but I'm kind of like, hasn't everybody who's going to get Borderlands 2 already got it?

1031
01:16:40,784 --> 01:16:41,524
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, alright, alright.

1032
01:16:42,185 --> 01:16:42,826
[SPEAKER_02]: Minecraft.

1033
01:16:44,061 --> 01:16:44,422
[SPEAKER_02]: True.

1034
01:16:44,862 --> 01:16:45,242
[SPEAKER_02]: True.

1035
01:16:46,663 --> 01:16:48,564
[SPEAKER_02]: That could be said for a lot of games, I guess.

1036
01:16:49,225 --> 01:16:50,665
[SPEAKER_02]: Minecraft on the go, man.

1037
01:16:50,766 --> 01:17:00,652
[SPEAKER_02]: And I understand, yeah, they have the Pocket Edition, but if this version is a little bit more like the PC version, it's all sorts of greatness.

1038
01:17:02,333 --> 01:17:04,755
[SPEAKER_02]: Too bad maybe it could talk to the PC version.

1039
01:17:04,855 --> 01:17:06,517
[SPEAKER_02]: Or the PS3 version would be very awesome.

1040
01:17:07,017 --> 01:17:13,002
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be awesome if it was... Well, I don't think you could do the PS4, but if all three versions talk to each other, that would be fantastic.

1041
01:17:13,422 --> 01:17:17,846
[SPEAKER_03]: Sony's not as much of a hard-ass on the PC communicating with...

1042
01:17:18,326 --> 01:17:19,227
[SPEAKER_03]: Sony servers.

1043
01:17:19,307 --> 01:17:26,973
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we see DC Universe Online is on both, even though I don't think their servers are cross-play, but Final Fantasy XIV just came out, and it's cross-play between the two.

1044
01:17:28,855 --> 01:17:32,178
[SPEAKER_03]: There's something else I'm thinking of that's PC and PlayStation cross.

1045
01:17:32,258 --> 01:17:34,379
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, well, like the whole Steam integration into Portal?

1046
01:17:34,480 --> 01:17:46,590
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the problem, though, with doing that is a lot of it, they have to develop the engine to be similar because they want the same draw distance and same features in there, and if one is significantly less power than the other one, they can't really do that.

1047
01:17:47,590 --> 01:17:48,871
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1048
01:17:49,031 --> 01:17:52,552
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, so yeah, Borderlands 2, that's supposed to be coming in 2014 sometime.

1049
01:17:52,833 --> 01:17:55,374
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm thinking maybe holiday because, you know, no date yet.

1050
01:17:55,654 --> 01:17:59,155
[SPEAKER_03]: Really good comment from Monty Boggs in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com.

1051
01:17:59,516 --> 01:18:04,038
[SPEAKER_03]: If I can transfer PlayStation 3 data, Borderlands 2 Vita would be tempting.

1052
01:18:04,738 --> 01:18:05,659
[SPEAKER_03]: and Transfaring.

1053
01:18:05,839 --> 01:18:08,341
[SPEAKER_03]: Wasn't that the whole term that Konami came up with a while ago?

1054
01:18:08,402 --> 01:18:09,543
[SPEAKER_03]: Transfaring your data?

1055
01:18:10,183 --> 01:18:10,944
[SPEAKER_03]: They could.

1056
01:18:11,585 --> 01:18:12,105
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll give you that.

1057
01:18:12,185 --> 01:18:14,628
[SPEAKER_03]: That is a pretty good reason to do it.

1058
01:18:16,029 --> 01:18:20,713
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole thing would depend on if the game is going to have all the same guns in it.

1059
01:18:21,074 --> 01:18:24,117
[SPEAKER_02]: If they develop all the same assets that are in the

1060
01:18:24,817 --> 01:18:25,117
[SPEAKER_02]: and so on.

1061
01:18:41,287 --> 01:18:44,271
[SPEAKER_03]: If they have all the things... Well, shouldn't it all be in the cloud?

1062
01:18:44,292 --> 01:18:45,513
[SPEAKER_03]: Just upload it to the cloud!

1063
01:18:45,954 --> 01:18:51,241
[SPEAKER_02]: It all depends, though, because if they have all that information, maybe they could do it without the guns.

1064
01:18:51,361 --> 01:18:51,762
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1065
01:18:53,144 --> 01:18:53,845
[SPEAKER_02]: It's possible.

1066
01:18:53,905 --> 01:18:55,447
[SPEAKER_02]: Depends on the content that's in the game.

1067
01:18:55,527 --> 01:18:57,911
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they could bring in all the guns, but we'll see.

1068
01:18:58,992 --> 01:19:07,758
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, the Vita memory cards, one of the things that people are complaining about a lot because they are pretty expensive, are being reduced in price as well.

1069
01:19:08,819 --> 01:19:13,122
[SPEAKER_02]: So, apparently, there are... I don't remember the final amounts to those.

1070
01:19:13,803 --> 01:19:14,223
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

1071
01:19:14,383 --> 01:19:15,944
[SPEAKER_02]: So, the Vita memory cards.

1072
01:19:16,025 --> 01:19:19,867
[SPEAKER_02]: Previously, for example, 4GB memory card is now $14.99, whereas originally $20.00.

1073
01:19:22,289 --> 01:19:24,971
[SPEAKER_02]: The 8GB memory card is now $19.99, where it was $30.

1074
01:19:25,011 --> 01:19:25,752
[SPEAKER_02]: $16 is $39.99, where it was $60.

1075
01:19:25,852 --> 01:19:27,653
[SPEAKER_02]: And the 32GB card is $80, where it was $100.

1076
01:19:27,773 --> 01:19:29,394
[SPEAKER_02]: So they are knocking the price off of those.

1077
01:19:29,414 --> 01:19:31,815
[SPEAKER_02]: It still sucks that it's proprietary, but...

1078
01:19:41,809 --> 01:19:42,509
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you going to do?

1079
01:19:42,930 --> 01:19:50,434
[SPEAKER_02]: Might as well invest in a pretty big memory card because especially if you do PlayStation Plus, get a bunch of free games.

1080
01:19:50,755 --> 01:19:54,157
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's also another strong point if they market that well enough.

1081
01:19:54,197 --> 01:19:59,780
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, hey, you buy a PlayStation Vita, you get PlayStation Plus, you can download a ton of fucking games.

1082
01:20:00,441 --> 01:20:00,941
[SPEAKER_02]: So why not?

1083
01:20:01,781 --> 01:20:12,804
[SPEAKER_03]: If they can really bring... If the Vita has a renaissance or whatever you want to call it where it really does kind of seem to take off this holiday season and essentially resurrect from the dead, you can't tell me that the Wii U can't do the same thing.

1084
01:20:13,145 --> 01:20:15,885
[SPEAKER_02]: They need a price drop because the Wii U is still $349.

1085
01:20:15,965 --> 01:20:19,406
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not going to cut it.

1086
01:20:19,446 --> 01:20:28,369
[SPEAKER_03]: We have something later on that might sweeten the pot a little bit, but I kind of agree that there's going to need to be a hard drop or Nintendo's going to be in trouble, but...

1087
01:20:29,306 --> 01:20:31,511
[SPEAKER_03]: Not that there's not a lot of great games coming, but...

1088
01:20:34,912 --> 01:20:39,595
[SPEAKER_03]: to register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com.

1089
01:20:39,955 --> 01:20:41,636
[SPEAKER_03]: Use the passphrase, judge.

1090
01:20:42,577 --> 01:20:43,337
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, anyhow.

1091
01:20:44,758 --> 01:20:50,002
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's move on to one more story here about Killer Instinct and some new information that came out about the game this week.

1092
01:20:50,462 --> 01:20:57,947
[SPEAKER_03]: One of those details, in the free-to-play version of Killer Instinct, you will be able to buy the additional characters for $5 each.

1093
01:20:58,447 --> 01:21:02,610
[SPEAKER_03]: Killer Instinct will be free to play with one character when the console comes out.

1094
01:21:02,890 --> 01:21:10,315
[SPEAKER_03]: There will be a $19.99 combo breaker pack that unlocks the game's full roster of 8 characters.

1095
01:21:11,195 --> 01:21:16,999
[SPEAKER_03]: Including 2 of them that are exclusive fighters that are not initially available for individual purchase.

1096
01:21:17,059 --> 01:21:22,282
[SPEAKER_03]: Meaning if you do piecemeal your game, you will have 6 fighters to choose from.

1097
01:21:22,762 --> 01:21:29,206
[SPEAKER_03]: There will also be a $40 Ultra Edition that will bundle all playable characters online.

1098
01:21:29,386 --> 01:21:43,521
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, an accessory and costume pack thingy, and the original 1994 arcade version of Killer Instinct, which has a lot of people more happy about the arcade version on their Xbox One than I think some people are about the new Killer Instinct.

1099
01:21:43,561 --> 01:21:51,029
[SPEAKER_02]: If you think there's only eight characters in this game, you're full of crap, because they're gonna fuckin' put DLC out there, they're gonna make you buy those fuckin' characters.

1100
01:21:51,069 --> 01:21:51,310
[SPEAKER_02]: Well...

1101
01:21:51,890 --> 01:22:16,870
[SPEAKER_03]: I think yes and no I think it will be eight this year and then depending on how the game does because this is how they're talking they're saying well you will have the 2013 season that has these eight characters and the next year we can put along eight more characters and put that into the game I'm literally hearing and I'm trying to be open and understanding but what I'm literally hearing is we're making it up as we go along

1102
01:22:18,058 --> 01:22:20,038
[SPEAKER_02]: 8 characters in a fighting game seems kind of lame.

1103
01:22:20,458 --> 01:22:27,100
[SPEAKER_02]: And the whole charging $5 for the characters is basically to get you to buy the $20 pack.

1104
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:31,040
[SPEAKER_02]: They never were intending for you to buy piecemeal characters.

1105
01:22:31,080 --> 01:22:32,701
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just like, yeah, we'll put it there.

1106
01:22:32,881 --> 01:22:34,121
[SPEAKER_02]: They want to be able to say it's free to play.

1107
01:22:34,181 --> 01:22:38,042
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we'll put it there so that people want to buy the $20 pack.

1108
01:22:38,082 --> 01:22:39,682
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all it really comes down to.

1109
01:22:39,742 --> 01:22:41,662
[SPEAKER_02]: And $20 for a fighting game is not a bad thing.

1110
01:22:42,643 --> 01:22:44,043
[SPEAKER_02]: 8 characters does seem quite...

1111
01:22:45,184 --> 01:22:52,012
[SPEAKER_03]: low but that's the original Street Fighter 2 had eight characters and even then there were still four bosses on top of that

1112
01:22:53,698 --> 01:23:00,400
[SPEAKER_03]: So, that's just the only, you know, and it's not that Street Fighter 2 was a bad game, it's just not 1991 anymore.

1113
01:23:01,160 --> 01:23:14,483
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and I did get a tweet earlier this week, and I apologize, I forgot the username of who sent it, but the tweet said, because I said, I was shading the fact that there was only the, you know, eight characters, and I got a tweet that said, what about quality over quantity?

1114
01:23:15,984 --> 01:23:32,666
[SPEAKER_03]: and I was I never responded to it because I was mobile or something like that but honestly my answer to that is wait a minute though part of the reason that make fighting games so much fun is kind of the diversity of the roster and you look at the fighting games that come out today eight characters doesn't cut it anymore you know you gotta have

1115
01:23:33,286 --> 01:23:34,327
[SPEAKER_03]: At least 15, 20.

1116
01:23:34,787 --> 01:23:36,269
[SPEAKER_03]: How many did the new Mortal Kombat have?

1117
01:23:36,629 --> 01:23:42,074
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, you have a good diverse roster makes the game more fun.

1118
01:23:42,194 --> 01:23:45,416
[SPEAKER_02]: Eight characters sounds like we rushed this game to get it out for the launch.

1119
01:23:46,297 --> 01:23:51,782
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a lot of the other games that have been coming out launch for the platform seems like a lot of it's rushed.

1120
01:23:52,362 --> 01:23:56,566
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe, you know, pre-end more characters later on so they can sell it as DLC.

1121
01:23:56,846 --> 01:24:01,570
[SPEAKER_02]: I think originally this game is probably going to be a retail release, but they just can't get it done in time.

1122
01:24:01,690 --> 01:24:09,782
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what really concerns me, is that all these signs are pointing... You know, it's like these warning signs are popping up about this game, and it has me really concerned.

1123
01:24:10,443 --> 01:24:12,065
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I don't think it's just this game.

1124
01:24:12,105 --> 01:24:16,171
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like Forza 5, for example, where it's shipping unfinished.

1125
01:24:16,892 --> 01:24:17,492
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on.

1126
01:24:19,393 --> 01:24:19,713
[SPEAKER_02]: So what?

1127
01:24:19,733 --> 01:24:20,874
[SPEAKER_02]: It's day one patch, okay?

1128
01:24:20,894 --> 01:24:21,394
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand that.

1129
01:24:21,434 --> 01:24:28,978
[SPEAKER_02]: But, dude, you better hope that your servers are fucking working day one because there's going to be some pissed people.

1130
01:24:29,158 --> 01:24:34,000
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I guess not because there's still content in the game, but you're just not going to be able to play the full thing yet.

1131
01:24:34,781 --> 01:24:35,781
[SPEAKER_03]: And here's the other thing.

1132
01:24:35,801 --> 01:24:44,385
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of don't trust Microsoft to keep it going, and I'm going to use my big old standby that I always bring up on the show and you're sick of hearing me talk about it.

1133
01:24:44,405 --> 01:24:45,406
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, well, there's two of them, remember?

1134
01:24:45,766 --> 01:24:51,930
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, well, the one I've got in my mind is remember when they said, we're going to bring a thousand games to game room.

1135
01:24:52,670 --> 01:24:53,511
[SPEAKER_03]: And then what happened?

1136
01:24:53,551 --> 01:24:56,993
[SPEAKER_03]: About 200 came out across 13 packs and they pulled the plug.

1137
01:24:57,514 --> 01:24:59,195
[SPEAKER_03]: So those thousand games never happened.

1138
01:24:59,575 --> 01:25:08,821
[SPEAKER_03]: So isn't it feasible that if Killer Instinct comes out and heaven forbid, it's not very good and people just aren't into it because there's not enough characters.

1139
01:25:09,281 --> 01:25:11,642
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think that 2014 pack will ever happen?

1140
01:25:11,883 --> 01:25:11,963
[SPEAKER_03]: Nope.

1141
01:25:11,983 --> 01:25:12,063
[SPEAKER_03]: Nope.

1142
01:25:12,543 --> 01:25:12,723
[SPEAKER_03]: Grrrr.

1143
01:25:35,123 --> 01:25:35,443
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow.

1144
01:25:35,683 --> 01:25:39,826
[SPEAKER_03]: Or an actual legitimate use for the Xbox camera.

1145
01:25:39,986 --> 01:25:43,149
[SPEAKER_03]: Weiland in our chatroom says, I'm waiting for PC Killer Instinct.

1146
01:25:44,434 --> 01:25:45,856
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that something they said is going to happen?

1147
01:25:45,876 --> 01:25:48,338
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I don't know if I would see that happening.

1148
01:25:49,159 --> 01:25:53,363
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably not, just because they want everybody to purchase the Xbox One stuff.

1149
01:25:53,383 --> 01:26:05,416
[SPEAKER_02]: I think maybe later on down the line when Windows 8 takes off and a lot more people have Windows 8 and that Windows Marketplace is more of a robust thing, then maybe you'll see stuff like that popping up there.

1150
01:26:05,476 --> 01:26:05,616
[SPEAKER_02]: But...

1151
01:26:06,457 --> 01:26:07,178
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1152
01:26:22,876 --> 01:26:31,899
[SPEAKER_03]: This character has the ability to throw spider webs to attack and ensnare opponents, and she has a pair of blades on the back of each hand and blades on her forearms and so forth.

1153
01:26:31,999 --> 01:26:35,940
[SPEAKER_03]: Does not look like a previous Killer Instinct fighter, which is fine.

1154
01:26:36,780 --> 01:26:48,224
[SPEAKER_03]: New fighting games in a franchise should have some new people, but I bet there's going to be some people that are a little irritated, like, alright, so there's going to be eight fighters...

1155
01:26:49,764 --> 01:26:55,188
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're going to fill them all up with slots of people that are new and not like... Where's Orchid?

1156
01:26:55,808 --> 01:26:56,548
[SPEAKER_03]: Where's Spinal?

1157
01:26:57,349 --> 01:26:58,830
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are coming in the DLC pack.

1158
01:27:00,491 --> 01:27:03,373
[SPEAKER_03]: The most popular character will be one of the two.

1159
01:27:03,393 --> 01:27:08,896
[SPEAKER_03]: I bet you Orchid will be in there, but she'll be one of those characters that you can only get when you buy... You can't piecemeal her.

1160
01:27:08,936 --> 01:27:10,377
[SPEAKER_03]: She'll be in that $20 combo pack.

1161
01:27:10,877 --> 01:27:11,718
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to get her that way.

1162
01:27:11,838 --> 01:27:12,778
[SPEAKER_03]: I bet you that's how it works.

1163
01:27:14,059 --> 01:27:16,360
[SPEAKER_03]: This is pretty cool news, though, despite all this, you know...

1164
01:27:17,801 --> 01:27:19,923
[SPEAKER_03]: Negative things we might be saying about Killer Instinct.

1165
01:27:20,563 --> 01:27:21,343
[SPEAKER_03]: This is pretty neat.

1166
01:27:21,904 --> 01:27:33,811
[SPEAKER_03]: Creative director Adam Isgreen and producer Torin Redding talking about Killer Instinct mentioned the original announcer, Chris Sutherland, will be selectable in lieu of the new announcer for Killer Instinct.

1167
01:27:34,111 --> 01:27:39,333
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you want to have the old Killer Instinct experience when it comes to the announcer, you can do that.

1168
01:27:40,213 --> 01:27:46,275
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess he did re-record some lines, and even though it's been 18 years later, sounds exactly the same.

1169
01:27:46,355 --> 01:27:48,916
[SPEAKER_03]: So it sounds like he's aged a little better than DuckTales did.

1170
01:27:48,936 --> 01:27:52,657
[SPEAKER_02]: Why didn't they just have him do it in the beginning?

1171
01:27:53,117 --> 01:27:54,777
[SPEAKER_02]: Just have him be the guy.

1172
01:27:54,797 --> 01:27:55,858
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a little weird, isn't it?

1173
01:27:56,218 --> 01:28:01,799
[SPEAKER_03]: Because maybe what they didn't say, they said Chris Sutherland will be selectable in a $4.99 DLC pack.

1174
01:28:04,661 --> 01:28:07,224
[SPEAKER_02]: $4.99.

1175
01:28:04,721 --> 01:28:07,224
[SPEAKER_02]: Try $40 deals.

1176
01:28:07,244 --> 01:28:07,545
[SPEAKER_02]: $40 packs.

1177
01:28:07,565 --> 01:28:08,566
[SPEAKER_02]: For an announcer?

1178
01:28:08,846 --> 01:28:09,787
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, I bet you.

1179
01:28:10,528 --> 01:28:11,970
[SPEAKER_02]: $40 because you get the original game.

1180
01:28:12,110 --> 01:28:13,372
[SPEAKER_02]: So you get the original announcer too.

1181
01:28:13,852 --> 01:28:14,693
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe, maybe.

1182
01:28:16,275 --> 01:28:19,038
[SPEAKER_03]: But I wasn't... Well, Dota 2 sells these announcer packs.

1183
01:28:19,178 --> 01:28:20,380
[SPEAKER_03]: It's part of the way they make money.

1184
01:28:20,400 --> 01:28:21,081
[SPEAKER_03]: They're free to play.

1185
01:28:21,681 --> 01:28:22,062
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knows?

1186
01:28:23,683 --> 01:28:29,765
[SPEAKER_03]: TigerClaw in our chat pointing out that character I mentioned earlier, they can't call her Spider-Woman anyway.

1187
01:28:30,105 --> 01:28:35,567
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't calling her that, but she looks like that type of character.

1188
01:28:35,587 --> 01:28:42,669
[SPEAKER_02]: Dota 2 announcer packs, I saw the one for GLaDOS and one of the lines in there is it's Oda, the D is silent.

1189
01:28:48,126 --> 01:28:48,447
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

1190
01:28:48,587 --> 01:28:48,967
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1191
01:28:49,608 --> 01:28:52,072
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we ready to get to the classic game of the week?

1192
01:28:52,232 --> 01:28:56,559
[SPEAKER_03]: Back in the day, you didn't have to pay $5 per character.

1193
01:28:56,679 --> 01:28:58,983
[SPEAKER_03]: You got all of it or you got nothing.

1194
01:28:59,423 --> 01:29:02,047
[SPEAKER_03]: And that takes us to a segment we call the classic game of the week.

1195
01:29:04,600 --> 01:29:22,046
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura will dive into the gaming vault but not this week because she dived into her bed to rest tonight so I will dive into the gaming vault in her place and pick a game that you all should be playing this week sorry I'm laughing because Ranma in the chatroom says screw you Rob Roberts, DuckTales hater now wait a minute, wait a minute put the brakes on for a minute

1196
01:29:23,271 --> 01:29:24,332
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1197
01:29:45,430 --> 01:29:57,772
[SPEAKER_03]: which is why I wish the sound production would have lended their talents better to that and two, I did not like that the cutscenes constantly interrupted the action all the time in what should be a very action based game that being said

1198
01:29:59,454 --> 01:30:02,157
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1199
01:30:16,835 --> 01:30:31,974
[SPEAKER_03]: and one of the games I have on the back burner to talk about I wanted to share with you guys one of these days was a game available on the Commodore 64 because you know I'm going to use this opportunity to do a Commodore 64 game the game is called The Great Gianna Sisters is the game I picked tonight

1200
01:30:35,939 --> 01:30:49,227
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, the great Giana Sisters, some of you have probably heard of this game because there's the Giana Sisters Twisted Dreams, which is an indie game that just came out on Steam Greenlight, and I think it's available on Xbox Arcade and PlayStation.

1201
01:30:49,647 --> 01:30:52,229
[SPEAKER_03]: So yes, its roots are in this very old...

1202
01:30:52,549 --> 01:30:53,370
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1203
01:31:11,327 --> 01:31:27,479
[SPEAKER_03]: the Commodore 64 version was programmed by Armin Gessert and the graphics were done by Manfred Trenz and the soundtrack was composed by Chris Hulsbeck funny note, he came back later to do the soundtracks for these later games that came out there was also a DS game

1204
01:31:28,079 --> 01:31:31,562
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I played the DS game, and it was alright.

1205
01:31:53,660 --> 01:31:55,584
[SPEAKER_03]: Most people know this game.

1206
01:31:55,624 --> 01:32:00,956
[SPEAKER_03]: If you've heard of this game, you know it because it was a very controversial game when it came out on the Commodore 64 because...

1207
01:32:03,027 --> 01:32:09,370
[SPEAKER_03]: It looked a lot like Super Mario Bros., down to the fact that they did the whole World 1-1 thing.

1208
01:32:09,750 --> 01:32:10,651
[SPEAKER_03]: What do I mean by that?

1209
01:32:11,151 --> 01:32:16,074
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, whenever a level creator comes out for a game, what's the first thing people usually make?

1210
01:32:17,234 --> 01:32:23,037
[SPEAKER_03]: A penis, and then after that, World 1-1 from Super Mario Bros., right?

1211
01:32:23,357 --> 01:32:23,597
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1212
01:32:23,978 --> 01:32:27,920
[SPEAKER_03]: So, unfortunately, in the case of the Great Giana Sisters, World 1...

1213
01:32:29,071 --> 01:32:31,734
[SPEAKER_03]: is pretty much World 1-1 from Super Mario Brothers.

1214
01:32:32,154 --> 01:32:39,222
[SPEAKER_03]: So the first level is almost identical in layout to Super Mario Brothers, and the game itself shares some similarities too.

1215
01:32:39,282 --> 01:32:52,015
[SPEAKER_03]: You pick up a magical pinwheel, it makes you bigger, and you have a little... You don't throw a fireball per se, but it's a bouncing ball, just like the Game Boy version of Super Mario Brothers.

1216
01:32:52,515 --> 01:33:01,082
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway, Nintendo pressured the makers of the Great Giana Sisters, threatening legal action if they do not take appropriate action.

1217
01:33:01,362 --> 01:33:04,005
[SPEAKER_03]: The game was voluntarily withdrawn from sale.

1218
01:33:04,105 --> 01:33:06,687
[SPEAKER_03]: No lawsuits or anything like that, but it was voluntarily withdrawn.

1219
01:33:07,067 --> 01:33:09,689
[SPEAKER_03]: Therefore, it makes this game very rare.

1220
01:33:10,350 --> 01:33:15,174
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, what they don't say about the controversy, and you don't know this unless you've played the game...

1221
01:33:15,774 --> 01:33:19,838
[SPEAKER_03]: The later levels don't really look like Mario Brothers levels.

1222
01:33:19,979 --> 01:33:27,507
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say maybe the second level has a little bit in common too, but I think there's 20 some odd levels in the game, and especially when you get into the later levels and some of the boss fights.

1223
01:33:28,283 --> 01:33:29,924
[SPEAKER_03]: It isn't like Mario Bros.

1224
01:33:29,964 --> 01:33:30,604
[SPEAKER_03]: in that regard.

1225
01:33:31,104 --> 01:33:40,647
[SPEAKER_03]: But unfortunately, a lot of the basic game mechanics, you know, with the whole power-ups and getting coins and jumping on the coin blocks and so forth, that is all still pretty similar.

1226
01:33:40,707 --> 01:33:45,668
[SPEAKER_03]: So it probably was in this company's best interest to take the game off the market.

1227
01:33:45,749 --> 01:33:54,731
[SPEAKER_03]: But this is what makes this game such a cult classic and why people desire it is that, you know, it was, in a sense, a Super Mario-like game on a 1983 Commodore 64 and...

1228
01:33:57,092 --> 01:34:11,703
[SPEAKER_03]: The soundtrack, the soundtrack, the soundtrack People love the soundtrack and rightfully so Great, great music available in the game So it's no wonder that they brought Chris Holspeck back to do the later games

1229
01:34:13,705 --> 01:34:18,428
[SPEAKER_03]: Very well received, very highly rated in a lot of old Commodore 64 productions.

1230
01:34:18,689 --> 01:34:21,671
[SPEAKER_03]: ZZap64 giving it 96%.

1231
01:34:22,512 --> 01:34:29,417
[SPEAKER_03]: There are various ports out there, but the ZX Spectrum port that was planned was pulled back because of illegal pressures.

1232
01:34:30,298 --> 01:34:32,920
[SPEAKER_03]: In 1993, the MSX version came out.

1233
01:34:33,720 --> 01:34:38,662
[SPEAKER_03]: The game had been ported to Windows, DOS, Linux, but all unofficially.

1234
01:34:39,943 --> 01:34:48,966
[SPEAKER_03]: Also a Nintendo DS version unofficially of the Commodore 64 port, not to be confused with the official sequel of Giana Sisters.

1235
01:34:49,906 --> 01:34:53,588
[SPEAKER_03]: There was also a mobile version of the game made for Android phones in 2005.

1236
01:34:56,674 --> 01:35:05,181
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a sequel planned for the game called Giana 2, Arthur and Martha in Future World, and it was supposed to have a futuristic setting.

1237
01:35:05,541 --> 01:35:13,567
[SPEAKER_03]: But because of all the legal troubles, Time Warp renamed the game Hard and Heavy and changed the protagonist to Robots.

1238
01:35:13,947 --> 01:35:19,912
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you've ever played the game Hard and Heavy, which came out on the Commodore 64 in 1989, that was inspired by Giana Sisters.

1239
01:35:19,952 --> 01:35:21,053
[SPEAKER_03]: It was supposed to be the sequel.

1240
01:35:21,973 --> 01:35:47,906
[SPEAKER_03]: um so Giana Sisters DS was an actual uh sequel that did come out in 2009 and then of course I think a lot of you know uh through Steam and so forth in July 2012 and the Kickstarter Giana Sisters Twisted Dreams became a reality so there you go the classic game of the week the Giana Sisters the great Giana Sisters yeah have you ever heard of this game in your life Loki

1241
01:35:48,598 --> 01:35:50,220
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I have played it actually

1242
01:36:07,402 --> 01:36:11,806
[SPEAKER_03]: TigerClaw on chat says, does that new Giana Sisters game poke fun at Nintendo despite them?

1243
01:36:11,826 --> 01:36:12,566
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I don't think it does.

1244
01:36:12,586 --> 01:36:13,787
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's pretty badass, actually.

1245
01:36:14,408 --> 01:36:21,913
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and actually, yeah, the game doesn't play, I mean, the good thing is they turn this, it's still a platforming game, but it's way different now, and it is badass.

1246
01:36:21,933 --> 01:36:30,299
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you flip between the sisters, and it causes changes in the environment, and yeah, I've played through a bit of it on Steam, and it's a fun little game to play.

1247
01:36:30,339 --> 01:36:36,044
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I talked about it on a previous episode of the show, but as far as a straight-up platformer goes, it's a lot of fun.

1248
01:36:37,364 --> 01:36:40,845
[SPEAKER_03]: ShadowNextGen says, has Rob played the modern port of Gianna Sisters?

1249
01:36:41,225 --> 01:36:41,825
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I haven't.

1250
01:36:42,265 --> 01:36:45,566
[SPEAKER_03]: I've played the DS one, and I've played this new one, Twisted Sisters.

1251
01:36:45,946 --> 01:36:52,608
[SPEAKER_03]: I did not even know until doing last-minute research for the article tonight that there was later ports that came on.

1252
01:36:53,909 --> 01:36:56,309
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, look at what she's fighting here in this video.

1253
01:36:56,389 --> 01:36:57,650
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a giant enemy crab.

1254
01:36:59,531 --> 01:37:01,292
[SPEAKER_03]: This game was just ahead of its time.

1255
01:37:02,752 --> 01:37:02,992
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1256
01:37:04,273 --> 01:37:06,134
[SPEAKER_03]: The Great Gianna Sisters, classic game of the week.

1257
01:37:06,634 --> 01:37:07,075
[SPEAKER_03]: How about that?

1258
01:37:07,135 --> 01:37:09,816
[SPEAKER_03]: Did I do good with 15 minutes to pick a game?

1259
01:37:10,336 --> 01:37:11,357
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1260
01:37:12,298 --> 01:37:17,060
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, we're going to take a quick break, and when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio, we got more news for you guys.

1261
01:37:17,080 --> 01:37:18,121
[SPEAKER_03]: The Fugo Question of the Week.

1262
01:37:18,461 --> 01:37:23,204
[SPEAKER_03]: I know our beginnings of the show was a little Sony-heavy, so we are going to talk about some of the goings-on in Microsoft's world.

1263
01:37:24,184 --> 01:37:26,446
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't have a lot in Nintendo news this week.

1264
01:37:26,846 --> 01:37:30,149
[SPEAKER_03]: That was more a couple weeks ago, but with their Nintendo Directs and so forth.

1265
01:37:30,169 --> 01:37:33,591
[SPEAKER_03]: But we do have at least one big piece in Nintendo news coming up after the break.

1266
01:37:33,611 --> 01:37:41,057
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, of course, most importantly, your calls, your emails, your voices when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1267
01:37:47,284 --> 01:37:57,046
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio, in progress with episode number 517 of our program, August 25th, 2013.

1268
01:37:58,307 --> 01:38:02,908
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, there is no show over Labor Day weekend, so this is a show that's going to have to hold you over for two weeks.

1269
01:38:03,228 --> 01:38:06,669
[SPEAKER_03]: But the good news is, I just said it's episode 517, so if you're newer to the show...

1270
01:38:08,069 --> 01:38:08,810
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1271
01:38:32,726 --> 01:38:33,607
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1272
01:38:54,679 --> 01:38:55,520
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really the only way.

1273
01:39:12,910 --> 01:39:17,693
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, so we are here to talk more news and get to the mailbag and all that fun stuff.

1274
01:39:18,554 --> 01:39:20,736
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do that right now with some rapid fire news.

1275
01:39:20,836 --> 01:39:21,096
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki.

1276
01:39:21,616 --> 01:39:29,462
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so this was kind of a surprise announcement out of the whole PlayStation 4 press conference that they had.

1277
01:39:29,882 --> 01:39:38,968
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a reimagining of a game called Shadow of the Beast which was an old side-scroller, I guess, for the Amiga.

1278
01:39:39,169 --> 01:39:40,249
[SPEAKER_02]: You know I know that game.

1279
01:39:40,770 --> 01:39:42,571
[SPEAKER_02]: And so now it's this like

1280
01:39:43,010 --> 01:39:49,155
[SPEAKER_03]: At first glance, you kind of go, oh, it's like Altered Beast, although no, but close enough, I guess.

1281
01:39:49,395 --> 01:39:55,740
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, and now it's coming to the PlayStation 4, so that's interesting, I guess.

1282
01:39:56,561 --> 01:39:59,323
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely not something you would guess would be coming.

1283
01:40:01,064 --> 01:40:10,792
[SPEAKER_02]: Game Dev Tycoon is coming to Steam this week, actually, August 29th, and it will be getting an HD, well, sort of an HD, a

1284
01:40:11,232 --> 01:40:12,893
[SPEAKER_02]: High-res treatment.

1285
01:40:13,193 --> 01:40:16,516
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you haven't played Game Dev Story, it was a game on the iOS platform.

1286
01:40:17,337 --> 01:40:18,177
[SPEAKER_02]: Fantastic.

1287
01:40:18,237 --> 01:40:28,405
[SPEAKER_02]: You run a game development company, and you make games, and you make consoles, and it's one of those kind of management sims.

1288
01:40:28,425 --> 01:40:30,146
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a lot of fun.

1289
01:40:30,526 --> 01:40:31,627
[SPEAKER_02]: So check it out.

1290
01:40:33,531 --> 01:40:37,275
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I'm sorry, I'm getting that confused, a game dev story.

1291
01:40:37,415 --> 01:40:40,798
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, Game Dev Tycoon was the one that they offered up out there.

1292
01:40:40,898 --> 01:40:42,579
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, there was a couple of them.

1293
01:40:42,599 --> 01:40:43,640
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, there was a couple, I'm sorry.

1294
01:40:43,680 --> 01:40:46,883
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the one that- Because I took a look at that first thing, and I'm like, wait a second, that doesn't quite look like it.

1295
01:40:46,903 --> 01:40:50,606
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, that's the one they put up on Pirate Bay or whatever, and then- Yeah, that's right.

1296
01:40:50,886 --> 01:40:56,347
[SPEAKER_03]: Ironically, your company would always go bankrupt due to piracy.

1297
01:40:56,407 --> 01:40:58,008
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's right.

1298
01:40:58,088 --> 01:40:58,568
[SPEAKER_02]: Never mind.

1299
01:40:58,648 --> 01:40:59,188
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

1300
01:40:59,948 --> 01:41:00,849
[SPEAKER_02]: This game is coming out.

1301
01:41:00,949 --> 01:41:03,309
[SPEAKER_02]: You should go play Game Dev Story if you haven't yet.

1302
01:41:03,669 --> 01:41:04,349
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fantastic.

1303
01:41:04,389 --> 01:41:06,890
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually on iOS.

1304
01:41:06,930 --> 01:41:08,270
[SPEAKER_02]: You can check that out.

1305
01:41:09,271 --> 01:41:10,551
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want Game Dev Story, I guess.

1306
01:41:12,190 --> 01:41:12,530
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1307
01:41:12,591 --> 01:41:18,197
[SPEAKER_02]: After that kind of move that they're trying to teach people a lesson, I think I'll teach them a lesson by not buying their game.

1308
01:41:19,318 --> 01:41:20,359
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on, it was funny.

1309
01:41:21,540 --> 01:41:22,882
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just not interested in it.

1310
01:41:23,663 --> 01:41:24,123
[SPEAKER_02]: And then...

1311
01:41:26,218 --> 01:41:27,619
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, come on.

1312
01:41:28,600 --> 01:41:46,456
[SPEAKER_02]: So Eurogamer kind of asked the question because it does beg to be asked since, you know, last year and wasn't very good because FIFA 13 on Vita and on the Wii

1313
01:41:46,943 --> 01:41:48,184
[SPEAKER_02]: What's a reskin of FIFA 12?

1314
01:41:49,425 --> 01:41:58,533
[SPEAKER_02]: So it begs the question, hey, guys, EA, are you going to be putting out an actual sequel to the game?

1315
01:41:58,553 --> 01:42:02,576
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you going to just reskin the game from last year?

1316
01:42:03,477 --> 01:42:07,100
[SPEAKER_02]: And so EA Sports came out with the best...

1317
01:42:08,060 --> 01:42:08,901
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura,

1318
01:42:34,677 --> 01:42:53,512
[SPEAKER_02]: so literally roster update 2014 FIFA 14 is FIFA 13 which was FIFA 12 so fantastic that the game has not changed as people have hoped you don't have to worry about that happening in the Wii version or Wii U version because guess what it's not coming out they didn't make a version for the Wii or Wii U

1319
01:42:54,232 --> 01:42:58,814
[SPEAKER_02]: Pro Evolution, now to be fair, Pro Evolution Soccer, same damn thing.

1320
01:42:58,834 --> 01:42:59,855
[SPEAKER_02]: They did that on the Wii.

1321
01:43:00,115 --> 01:43:06,577
[SPEAKER_02]: We do know that this year, though, that is not the case, at least with the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions, since those are using the Fox engine now and it's a completely different thing.

1322
01:43:07,378 --> 01:43:11,559
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think actually the FIFA is using their new engine, the Ignite engine.

1323
01:43:13,500 --> 01:43:22,524
[SPEAKER_03]: Going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com, Bobby Blackwolf, having played both GameDev games, wants you to know GameDev Tycoon is a lot deeper than GameDev Story.

1324
01:43:23,365 --> 01:43:24,465
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot more difficult.

1325
01:43:25,025 --> 01:43:33,729
[SPEAKER_03]: Blackwolf also is telling other chatters that he's going to make Podcast Network Tycoon, where you create a podcast network and have to deal with certain listeners.

1326
01:43:35,350 --> 01:43:36,391
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you should make that game.

1327
01:43:36,431 --> 01:43:37,211
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be a lot of fun.

1328
01:43:39,272 --> 01:44:04,481
[SPEAKER_03]: that's the next thing VOG needs to get into game development because you don't do enough programming Bobby let's take on another project come on love it all right um let's move on to some more rapid fire news uh I'll do a couple stories here one of them about Retro City Rampage on the 3ds I think we've talked before it is coming uh they're actually going to have it playable at PAX Prime but this is interesting you're not actually going to be able to play it in 3d at PAX Prime

1329
01:44:04,981 --> 01:44:05,742
[SPEAKER_03]: So, okay.

1330
01:44:07,043 --> 01:44:16,614
[SPEAKER_03]: However, this will be the latest version of Retro City Rampage that has the Retro Plus graphics mode that will double on-screen colors and add soft shadows to the game.

1331
01:44:17,395 --> 01:44:19,337
[SPEAKER_03]: It is coming out on the 3DS eShop.

1332
01:44:20,338 --> 01:44:22,601
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it going to be in 3D or is it just not the 3D version?

1333
01:44:23,041 --> 01:44:43,488
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the 3D version is not actually playable at PAX that's what I'm gathering but yeah it sounds like it will be in 3D but I would imagine it's going to be pretty limited I mean when you see the retro games in 3D it's usually like one layer is this way and one layer I wouldn't expect but who knows it might exceed those expectations remember this is all one guy making this too

1334
01:44:44,068 --> 01:44:45,009
[SPEAKER_03]: That's very impressive.

1335
01:44:46,790 --> 01:45:04,423
[SPEAKER_03]: More information for Super Smash Bros., whatever the new one might be called, on the 3DS and the Wii U. A new screenshot has revealed that there will be a stage based off of Metroid Other M. It's the Pyrosphere from Metroid Other M, which is a pleasant surprise because, you know, I know a lot of us love Metroid.

1336
01:45:04,803 --> 01:45:06,204
[SPEAKER_03]: Metroid Other M, on the other hand...

1337
01:45:06,564 --> 01:45:06,944
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

1338
01:45:29,058 --> 01:45:39,681
[SPEAKER_03]: Also of note for Smash Bros., Mashihiro Sakurai has noted that in the 3DS version of Smash Bros., you can actually have outlines around the characters.

1339
01:45:40,101 --> 01:45:43,102
[SPEAKER_03]: And I believe this is to help them stand out on the smaller screen.

1340
01:45:43,782 --> 01:45:44,902
[SPEAKER_03]: However, you don't have to do it.

1341
01:45:45,563 --> 01:45:46,723
[SPEAKER_03]: The mention was that you can have 3D.

1342
01:45:46,803 --> 01:45:50,885
[SPEAKER_03]: Thick outlines, thin outlines, or just turn them off.

1343
01:45:52,446 --> 01:45:55,427
[SPEAKER_03]: Fans very interested in these when the pictures first came out.

1344
01:45:55,767 --> 01:46:05,132
[SPEAKER_03]: The lines are there to help you see playable characters from the backgrounds and I would assume the various Pokemon that will show up and the other assists that happen in the fight.

1345
01:46:05,432 --> 01:46:07,313
[SPEAKER_03]: It can get a little crazy on that tiny screen.

1346
01:46:08,613 --> 01:46:09,414
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's great news.

1347
01:46:10,354 --> 01:46:26,853
[SPEAKER_03]: and I love I love it when a developer the more power they put in the hands of the player I mean not to you know use an old game cliche but the more customization that the player has to really make the game they want I say the better instead of saying we're going to do this we're going to put outlines and that's the way it's going to be deal with it

1348
01:46:27,762 --> 01:46:28,643
[SPEAKER_03]: So, love that.

1349
01:46:29,443 --> 01:46:31,524
[SPEAKER_03]: A brand new expansion revealed for Diablo 3.

1350
01:46:32,005 --> 01:46:33,626
[SPEAKER_03]: We talked about earlier in the show Diablo 3.

1351
01:46:34,246 --> 01:46:35,647
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, an expansion has been announced.

1352
01:46:35,707 --> 01:46:37,888
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called Reaper of Souls.

1353
01:46:38,529 --> 01:46:42,651
[SPEAKER_03]: It will have a new act in the game, five new levels, and the Crusader class.

1354
01:46:42,691 --> 01:46:46,193
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a holy knight, very similar to the Paladin in Diablo 2.

1355
01:46:47,454 --> 01:46:49,035
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, the loot system being overhauled.

1356
01:46:49,055 --> 01:46:50,556
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to call that Loot 2.0.

1357
01:46:51,076 --> 01:46:52,437
[SPEAKER_03]: It has something called Smart Drop.

1358
01:46:52,817 --> 01:46:54,218
[SPEAKER_03]: Paragon System No Paragon Level Cap

1359
01:47:17,205 --> 01:47:17,265
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm.

1360
01:47:32,065 --> 01:47:34,467
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so a few announcements.

1361
01:47:34,948 --> 01:47:36,990
[SPEAKER_02]: Once again, this is going back to some of the Sony stuff.

1362
01:47:37,350 --> 01:47:41,114
[SPEAKER_02]: Gran Turismo 6 is now coming out on December 6th, so it's easy for you to remember.

1363
01:47:41,634 --> 01:47:43,035
[SPEAKER_02]: And that would be on PlayStation 3.

1364
01:47:44,196 --> 01:47:50,502
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're going to have the most cars on disc of any Gran Turismo game yet.

1365
01:47:51,343 --> 01:47:56,268
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess if you pre-order it some places, like the Evil G, you may get some additional cars.

1366
01:47:58,207 --> 01:48:15,216
[SPEAKER_02]: and uh what I thought was interesting though they actually showed like a little bit of a trailer and stuff is that car companies are developing um prototype cars in Gran Turismo 6 like they're making some of their prototypes available to play as I thought that was kind of cool

1367
01:48:16,116 --> 01:48:18,898
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a heck of a sign of the times, isn't it?

1368
01:48:18,938 --> 01:48:23,540
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not interested at all in Gran Turismo 6 because driving simulators, I'm just terrible at.

1369
01:48:23,700 --> 01:48:24,761
[SPEAKER_02]: Arcade, fine.

1370
01:48:24,861 --> 01:48:27,282
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, arcade, fine, but in the exact same way.

1371
01:48:28,243 --> 01:48:29,364
[SPEAKER_03]: Mario Kart, loved it.

1372
01:48:29,524 --> 01:48:30,804
[SPEAKER_02]: Blur was a great game.

1373
01:48:30,985 --> 01:48:33,086
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's something I would love Sony to do.

1374
01:48:34,146 --> 01:48:38,409
[SPEAKER_02]: Give me a Forza Horizon version of Gran Turismo.

1375
01:48:38,609 --> 01:48:40,150
[SPEAKER_02]: Would be fantastic.

1376
01:48:40,170 --> 01:48:42,151
[SPEAKER_02]: Forza Horizon was really good.

1377
01:48:43,427 --> 01:48:44,007
[SPEAKER_02]: Give me something like that.

1378
01:48:44,047 --> 01:48:46,188
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe that's what DriveClub is.

1379
01:48:46,268 --> 01:48:49,309
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what DriveClub is.

1380
01:48:49,349 --> 01:48:52,030
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what DriveClub is either.

1381
01:48:52,110 --> 01:48:54,331
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if it's more simulation or more arcade-y.

1382
01:48:54,451 --> 01:48:57,112
[SPEAKER_02]: Give me an arcade version of Gran Turismo 6.

1383
01:48:57,712 --> 01:49:01,693
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be pretty sweet.

1384
01:49:02,753 --> 01:49:03,253
[SPEAKER_02]: That's coming.

1385
01:49:03,494 --> 01:49:04,074
[SPEAKER_02]: December 6th.

1386
01:49:04,454 --> 01:49:07,935
[SPEAKER_02]: So far, I might add, the only game announced for December is...

1387
01:49:10,650 --> 01:49:35,692
[SPEAKER_02]: I still think Ubisoft is going to move South Park there and put in the Far Cry 3 it's just my own thought because last year they did it with Far Cry 3 and it worked out really well for them I thought they pushed the South Park game back to next year they kind of hinted that that could be a possibility because Matt Stone and Trey Parker kind of work on it on their own pace and you're not going to get them to hurry up so it's when it's done I guess fair enough

1388
01:49:36,612 --> 01:49:37,153
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, alright.

1389
01:49:37,553 --> 01:49:44,018
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, uh, Pokemon X and Y. Uh, the soundtrack will be coming out, and it's coming on four discs.

1390
01:49:44,538 --> 01:49:45,659
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a lot of tracks.

1391
01:49:45,859 --> 01:49:47,200
[SPEAKER_02]: 212 tracks, to be exact.

1392
01:49:47,481 --> 01:49:49,002
[SPEAKER_02]: Three and a half hours of music.

1393
01:49:49,902 --> 01:49:54,246
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's available, I guess, um, on CDJapan for 2,500 yen.

1394
01:49:55,787 --> 01:49:58,589
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um... So, yeah.

1395
01:49:58,869 --> 01:50:00,070
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, uh, not bad.

1396
01:50:01,591 --> 01:50:02,252
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, of course...

1397
01:50:04,585 --> 01:50:26,093
[SPEAKER_02]: There hasn't really been any good Capcom fighting games, or I should say Street Fighter games, on the Wii U. Capcom's basically saying, nope, no Street Fighter on the Wii U. No plans to bring any of the games, no plans for Ultra to come there.

1398
01:50:28,574 --> 01:50:29,454
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe Street Fighter V?

1399
01:50:29,474 --> 01:50:29,895
[SPEAKER_02]: No idea.

1400
01:50:31,135 --> 01:50:45,441
[SPEAKER_02]: However, there will be some eShop versions of Street Fighter coming to the Wii U. Street Fighter 2, they're coming out with Street Fighter 2, Street Fighter 2 Turbo, Super Street Fighter 2 will be out on Virtual Console.

1401
01:50:46,602 --> 01:50:47,742
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are going to be $7.99 each.

1402
01:50:51,036 --> 01:50:57,060
[SPEAKER_03]: If you miss your fighting game that only has eight playable characters, at least you know this one's solid.

1403
01:50:57,800 --> 01:50:58,641
[SPEAKER_03]: Classic Street Fighter.

1404
01:50:58,981 --> 01:50:59,141
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1405
01:50:59,481 --> 01:51:03,584
[SPEAKER_03]: Did they ever put out Killer Instinct on, uh... I don't believe they did.

1406
01:51:04,064 --> 01:51:05,625
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know what I have sitting right over there?

1407
01:51:06,065 --> 01:51:07,026
[SPEAKER_03]: A Super Nintendo.

1408
01:51:07,386 --> 01:51:09,487
[SPEAKER_03]: And you see that black cartridge lying on top of that?

1409
01:51:09,727 --> 01:51:10,848
[SPEAKER_03]: That can only be one thing.

1410
01:51:11,709 --> 01:51:12,809
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm not too worried.

1411
01:51:14,910 --> 01:51:16,451
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, I gotta thank Alan for that, though.

1412
01:51:16,471 --> 01:51:18,273
[SPEAKER_03]: That's his Killer Instinct cartridge, not mine.

1413
01:51:18,453 --> 01:51:18,833
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

1414
01:51:19,235 --> 01:51:23,398
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let's get to the Fugle Question of the Week.

1415
01:51:23,418 --> 01:51:26,160
[SPEAKER_03]: You take Facebook, you take Google, slam them together, you get Fugle.

1416
01:51:33,757 --> 01:51:42,503
[SPEAKER_03]: Every week we ask a question of our Facebook community at facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio and our Google Plus page over at plus.google.com slash 110... No, I'm kidding.

1417
01:51:42,783 --> 01:51:43,844
[SPEAKER_03]: Just search for Orange Lounge Radio.

1418
01:51:44,364 --> 01:51:45,345
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1419
01:51:45,625 --> 01:51:52,010
[SPEAKER_03]: Very simple question this week because most of the news this week, most of the heavy-hitting news was centered around Sony's big press conference.

1420
01:51:52,350 --> 01:51:53,150
[SPEAKER_03]: We know the date.

1421
01:51:53,410 --> 01:51:54,291
[SPEAKER_03]: We know the details.

1422
01:51:54,591 --> 01:51:59,014
[SPEAKER_03]: We pretty much know all there is to know about PlayStation 4's launch at this point.

1423
01:51:59,054 --> 01:52:00,916
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe a few surprises at a Tokyo game show.

1424
01:52:01,976 --> 01:52:02,857
[SPEAKER_03]: So what's the verdict?

1425
01:52:03,397 --> 01:52:05,279
[SPEAKER_03]: I figure most people have made up their mind.

1426
01:52:05,599 --> 01:52:07,240
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the verdict on the PlayStation 4?

1427
01:52:07,560 --> 01:52:08,421
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you getting one?

1428
01:52:08,881 --> 01:52:10,422
[SPEAKER_03]: Why or why not?

1429
01:52:11,082 --> 01:52:22,270
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's start with an answer on Google Plus from Jamie Monn who says, I was already sold on the PlayStation 4, but the fact that they came out of the box with no shady online requirements and it's cheaper was a plus.

1430
01:52:22,870 --> 01:52:27,473
[SPEAKER_03]: What they revealed this week wasn't anything to write home about, but didn't sway my opinion either way.

1431
01:52:27,693 --> 01:52:30,936
[SPEAKER_03]: That being said, I plan on buying both systems at launch.

1432
01:52:32,136 --> 01:52:32,877
[SPEAKER_03]: Lucky guy.

1433
01:52:33,417 --> 01:52:34,818
[SPEAKER_03]: Lucky guy.

1434
01:52:34,918 --> 01:52:39,441
[SPEAKER_03]: Black Dynamite says, Getting one absolutely day one no way.

1435
01:52:39,961 --> 01:52:44,444
[SPEAKER_03]: Using the show's golden rule, a console is only as good as the games that are on it applies here.

1436
01:52:45,025 --> 01:52:48,567
[SPEAKER_03]: Any worthwhile game, Grand Theft Auto V, Call of Duty, Final Fantasy, etc.

1437
01:52:48,607 --> 01:52:49,788
[SPEAKER_03]: are coming out for current gen.

1438
01:52:50,068 --> 01:52:53,130
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no real reason to get one unless you just want the latest and greatest.

1439
01:52:53,410 --> 01:52:56,672
[SPEAKER_03]: Which I believe is an answer that echoes where Loki's head is at right now, right?

1440
01:52:59,329 --> 01:53:05,452
[SPEAKER_02]: I still probably will get one, but Grand Theft Auto, man, we'll see.

1441
01:53:05,612 --> 01:53:13,917
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of where I'm at, because I'm like, I still want one, and the gamer that has to have all the new toys wants one.

1442
01:53:14,197 --> 01:53:23,323
[SPEAKER_03]: And yes, I love that you invoked the golden rule of gaming, and there's no games I'm dying for at launch, but I kind of want that console still.

1443
01:53:23,383 --> 01:53:26,024
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to buy Grand Theft Auto V.

1444
01:53:28,306 --> 01:53:30,968
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously, you just need to do that.

1445
01:53:32,069 --> 01:53:39,995
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me know what system Bobby's getting it on because at least I know I'm going to play against you and get killed, but I can play against Bobby and we're about evenly matched.

1446
01:53:40,035 --> 01:53:41,376
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't play against me.

1447
01:53:41,476 --> 01:53:42,357
[SPEAKER_02]: We're in a crew.

1448
01:53:42,397 --> 01:53:44,338
[SPEAKER_02]: We go do heists.

1449
01:53:44,519 --> 01:53:44,859
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.

1450
01:53:44,879 --> 01:53:45,659
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like Mass Effect.

1451
01:53:45,679 --> 01:53:47,801
[SPEAKER_02]: We get a VOG crew together and we do heists.

1452
01:53:47,821 --> 01:53:48,862
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's just like Mass Effect.

1453
01:53:49,978 --> 01:53:51,679
[SPEAKER_02]: No, Mass Effect is lame.

1454
01:53:51,739 --> 01:53:52,120
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

1455
01:53:52,140 --> 01:53:54,241
[SPEAKER_03]: You're supposed to say yes because that gets me to buy it.

1456
01:53:54,641 --> 01:53:55,242
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, fine.

1457
01:53:55,282 --> 01:53:56,583
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it's like Mass Effect.

1458
01:53:57,083 --> 01:53:57,443
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1459
01:53:58,124 --> 01:54:03,427
[SPEAKER_03]: Actdeft says, I'm going to wait to see where the consoles go and what games really do interest me on consoles.

1460
01:54:03,487 --> 01:54:05,629
[SPEAKER_03]: For now, I'll stick to my PC and my 3DS.

1461
01:54:07,470 --> 01:54:36,024
[SPEAKER_03]: Redertainment says no not because I don't want one but because project buy a house takes priority well real life sometimes does Techie Q says yes I will get a Playstation 4 at launch I need to trade in my 360 because it's gathering dust because I'm using my PS3 as my main console for gaming and video streaming the Evil G was offering 50% more in store credit towards a Playstation 4 in June oh boy all these incentives the Evil G is going to throw out there I'm just going to throw this out there as a word of advice

1462
01:54:37,205 --> 01:54:37,745
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

1463
01:55:04,520 --> 01:55:24,733
[SPEAKER_03]: SSJ100 Matt in chat says Grand Theft Auto 5 VOG game nights will be great yep yep that is definitely gonna happen and you're gonna be able to stream them I hope I will and then DarkSakura is in chat letting us still know her opinion she says I've revised my rule I have a new golden rule never buy a game system or an Apple product at launch

1464
01:55:26,794 --> 01:55:27,494
[SPEAKER_03]: You're no fun.

1465
01:55:28,355 --> 01:55:28,955
[SPEAKER_03]: No fun at all.

1466
01:55:29,515 --> 01:55:30,475
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, let's go to Facebook.

1467
01:55:30,495 --> 01:55:31,735
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are all our answers from Google+.

1468
01:55:31,775 --> 01:55:32,556
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do Facebook.

1469
01:55:33,536 --> 01:55:35,456
[SPEAKER_03]: Holy moly, 18 comments on Facebook.

1470
01:55:35,476 --> 01:55:37,397
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to try to do this relatively quick.

1471
01:55:37,517 --> 01:55:38,597
[SPEAKER_03]: I apologize in advance.

1472
01:55:39,077 --> 01:55:40,337
[SPEAKER_03]: I may not read all of these.

1473
01:55:40,357 --> 01:55:42,498
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to try to pick out people I don't usually see.

1474
01:55:43,278 --> 01:55:45,919
[SPEAKER_03]: Kurti K says, I won't be getting one this year.

1475
01:55:46,359 --> 01:55:50,840
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not looking forward to any of the launch titles, so I can wait until at least next year to pick up one.

1476
01:55:51,780 --> 01:55:56,542
[SPEAKER_03]: Burr says, I'm getting one, but that's because I'm a consumer whore who has pre-ordered both systems.

1477
01:55:56,943 --> 01:56:02,345
[SPEAKER_03]: However, I feel confident that the PlayStation 4 will be worth it just for whatever Naughty Dog develops for it.

1478
01:56:03,365 --> 01:56:06,367
[SPEAKER_03]: Doug T says, I will be buying the PlayStation 4 day one.

1479
01:56:06,747 --> 01:56:08,808
[SPEAKER_03]: I love my PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita.

1480
01:56:08,908 --> 01:56:12,710
[SPEAKER_03]: I like Sony consoles better as they bring out more games that I like, such as RPGs.

1481
01:56:13,470 --> 01:56:17,512
[SPEAKER_03]: Brian G says, I will wait until there's a compelling reason for me to buy one.

1482
01:56:17,872 --> 01:56:22,173
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a gaming PC, and like Loki, Grand Theft Auto will keep me busy for a long time.

1483
01:56:23,254 --> 01:56:29,496
[SPEAKER_03]: Loco Poco says, I'll be getting one day one, excited for Knack and Killzone, also because I'm a consumer whore.

1484
01:56:31,697 --> 01:56:40,461
[SPEAKER_03]: Renee, one of our buddies from Koopa Club, says, I will not be getting a PS4 this year, not because I don't want it, but because I'm not ready to make that monetary investment just yet.

1485
01:56:41,421 --> 01:56:43,042
[SPEAKER_03]: Jeremy J., also from Koopa Club, says,

1486
01:57:11,281 --> 01:57:37,437
[SPEAKER_03]: and uh let's see a couple last answers here HitStun says slow down I don't even have a PlayStation 3 yet I still want to play Journey, Valkyria Chronicles, and Tokyo Jungle PlayStation 4 just doesn't have any games I could get hyped about and lastly Codeman says I canceled my pre-order I have a PC but I just don't have the funds nor do I really need one right now the only reason are games that have sold this to me is Kingdom Hearts 3 and Final Fantasy 15 I

1487
01:57:38,297 --> 01:57:42,080
[SPEAKER_03]: Although they are developing Kingdom Hearts 3 on PC, so there might be a PC build.

1488
01:57:42,560 --> 01:57:44,422
[SPEAKER_03]: I will wait just to let the dust settle.

1489
01:57:44,982 --> 01:57:45,503
[SPEAKER_03]: And tacos.

1490
01:57:46,744 --> 01:57:48,505
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the answers there from Facebook.

1491
01:57:48,545 --> 01:57:51,907
[SPEAKER_03]: I apologize I didn't read them all just because there were so many answers.

1492
01:57:52,168 --> 01:57:56,131
[SPEAKER_03]: But I do encourage our listeners to check out the variety of answers available on Facebook.

1493

1495
01:58:15,670 --> 01:58:20,853
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so let's talk a little bit about the Xbox One.

1496
01:58:21,194 --> 01:58:28,038
[SPEAKER_02]: Europe, they made an announcement that, hey, we're going to get you to buy the Xbox One because we know what you Europeans like.

1497
01:58:28,578 --> 01:58:29,479
[SPEAKER_02]: You like FIFA.

1500
01:58:41,286 --> 01:58:43,327
[SPEAKER_03]: Go figure to try and get more sales.

1501
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:45,661
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a joke.

1502
01:58:47,502 --> 01:58:49,744
[SPEAKER_02]: I got that.

1503
01:58:50,324 --> 01:58:54,708
[SPEAKER_02]: So yes, it'll be also available on Xbox 360.

1504
01:58:54,748 --> 01:58:56,469
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get a bundle as well for €199.

1505
01:58:56,990 --> 01:58:58,891
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah.

1506
01:59:00,833 --> 01:59:03,255
[SPEAKER_02]: So FIFA.

1507
01:59:03,735 --> 01:59:04,075
[SPEAKER_02]: FIFA 14.

1508
01:59:04,335 --> 01:59:06,177
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how they're going to sell it to you.

1509
01:59:07,452 --> 01:59:08,793
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.

1510
01:59:10,534 --> 01:59:12,735
[SPEAKER_03]: It's interesting that it's a third-party game.

1511
01:59:12,835 --> 01:59:14,035
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the part that gets me.

1512
01:59:14,656 --> 01:59:15,796
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, wow, it's a third-party.

1513
01:59:15,896 --> 01:59:17,357
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it really does sweeten the deal, though.

1514
01:59:17,697 --> 01:59:25,381
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, with the fact that the console's $100 more expensive, it goes a long way to put a game in there to give that extra value.

1515
01:59:25,522 --> 01:59:32,225
[SPEAKER_03]: I realize a game is only $60, but remember, Kinect and blah, blah, blah, blah, whether you like it or not, that is all stuff that's coming with it.

1516
01:59:32,285 --> 01:59:35,587
[SPEAKER_02]: Which FIFA 14 does not, or I don't believe uses Kinect.

1517
01:59:36,327 --> 01:59:39,189
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I don't know if it uses Kinect because they don't say anymore.

1518
01:59:39,309 --> 01:59:41,510
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of the Xbox One games aren't right away.

1519
01:59:42,150 --> 01:59:45,172
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some, but, you know, there's a lot that aren't.

1520
01:59:45,912 --> 01:59:48,153
[SPEAKER_03]: At least if what we saw at E3 is to be any indication.

1521
01:59:48,173 --> 01:59:55,918
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if they use it on the 360, let's assume that the features for the Kinect are going to be pretty similar on the Xbox One as they are on the Xbox 360.

1522
01:59:56,938 --> 02:00:06,226
[SPEAKER_02]: So, the advantage that you get with the Xbox One is you paid $100 more for that stupid camera and they're going to penalize you for swearing at the game.

1523
02:00:07,227 --> 02:00:09,048
[SPEAKER_02]: So, count me in.

1524
02:00:10,289 --> 02:00:11,830
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's not going to work in my house.

1525
02:00:11,890 --> 02:00:15,613
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, just the other night, actually one game I've been playing a lot of this week...

1526
02:00:16,354 --> 02:00:17,195
[SPEAKER_03]: Bit Trip Runner 2.

1527
02:00:17,896 --> 02:00:19,277
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't talk about this in my gaming week.

1528
02:00:19,417 --> 02:00:20,658
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, that's free, isn't it?

1529
02:00:20,718 --> 02:00:22,099
[SPEAKER_03]: It's free on PlayStation Plus.

1530
02:00:22,280 --> 02:00:27,525
[SPEAKER_03]: I bought it months ago on Wii U, but I was like, well shit, it's free and I want trophies.

1531
02:00:27,765 --> 02:00:28,726
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to play it again.

1532
02:00:29,486 --> 02:00:34,691
[SPEAKER_03]: And every time I'm playing that game, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, fuck!

1533
02:00:36,313 --> 02:00:37,574
[SPEAKER_03]: God damn it!

1534
02:00:39,193 --> 02:00:40,614
[SPEAKER_03]: All the way back to the beginning of the level.

1535
02:00:44,935 --> 02:00:46,176
[SPEAKER_03]: That's me playing Bit.Trip.

1536
02:00:48,156 --> 02:00:51,918
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't need the Kinect penalizing me further for swearing.

1537
02:00:52,218 --> 02:00:55,539
[SPEAKER_03]: Although a lot of that is obviously overdone.

1538
02:00:55,619 --> 02:00:56,019
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on.

1539
02:00:56,759 --> 02:01:01,361
[SPEAKER_03]: What Kinect games are really going to penalize you for swearing unless it's like Sesame Street Adventures?

1540
02:01:01,501 --> 02:01:03,602
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to card you in the game.

1541
02:01:04,842 --> 02:01:05,883
[SPEAKER_02]: Or flag you, I guess.

1542
02:01:06,303 --> 02:01:06,503
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1543
02:01:07,243 --> 02:01:07,604
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1544
02:01:07,684 --> 02:01:10,166
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems kind of lame that they have that as an option.

1545
02:01:10,286 --> 02:01:15,351
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the best you could come up with for Kinect is that.

1546
02:01:15,851 --> 02:01:17,953
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of the stuff, yeah, that doesn't make any sense to me.

1547
02:01:17,973 --> 02:01:19,715
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, in Europe, that's a huge deal.

1548
02:01:19,775 --> 02:01:21,157
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like Mario Brothers.

1549
02:01:21,197 --> 02:01:25,360
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm not knocking that, you know, they're bringing in... That's a big thing for... I'm talking about Kinect.

1550
02:01:25,861 --> 02:01:31,646
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, what they're using it for is just like a lot of this voice recognition stuff that I think you could probably do just fine with...

1551
02:01:32,387 --> 02:01:33,028
[SPEAKER_02]: A headset.

1552
02:01:33,209 --> 02:01:42,303
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't understand why they need a whole thing to watch you to do this voice stuff.

1553
02:01:42,323 --> 02:01:42,664
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1554
02:01:44,045 --> 02:01:46,906
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, well, some other big Microsoft news this week.

1555
02:01:46,966 --> 02:01:53,409
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure many of you have heard that the current CEO of Microsoft, Steve Ballmer, no, Bill Gates is not CEO.

1556
02:01:53,809 --> 02:01:56,890
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually Steve Ballmer is the Microsoft CEO.

1557
02:01:57,631 --> 02:02:00,892
[SPEAKER_03]: He will be retiring from that position over the next 12 months.

1558
02:02:01,372 --> 02:02:02,573
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't know exactly when.

1559
02:02:02,633 --> 02:02:06,915
[SPEAKER_03]: I would imagine a lot of that depends on when they figure out who is going to be replacing him.

1560
02:02:08,015 --> 02:02:09,476
[SPEAKER_03]: And how well the Xbox One does.

1561
02:02:09,496 --> 02:02:09,816
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1562
02:02:10,516 --> 02:02:11,717
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know about... First retirement.

1563
02:02:11,757 --> 02:02:19,379
[SPEAKER_03]: The problem is people were already criticizing Steve Ballmer and it's not necessarily related to the Xbox One because like you said, it's not out yet.

1564
02:02:19,419 --> 02:02:19,960
[SPEAKER_03]: Windows 8, yeah.

1565
02:02:20,780 --> 02:02:22,681
[SPEAKER_03]: It's that and the tablets.

1566
02:02:23,001 --> 02:02:23,701
[SPEAKER_02]: Windows Surface.

1567
02:02:23,901 --> 02:02:27,903
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the tablets, the phones, they haven't really been doing as well as they should have been.

1568
02:02:27,983 --> 02:02:28,483
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah.

1569
02:02:29,043 --> 02:02:35,026
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, you get a lot of that stuff, and the stockholders are saying maybe it's time for somebody else.

1570
02:02:35,786 --> 02:02:38,607
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a panel put together to try and find a replacement.

1571
02:02:38,667 --> 02:02:44,570
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, the panel includes Bill Gates, Chuck Nusky, Steven Luxo, also on that panel.

1572
02:02:46,331 --> 02:02:53,193
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, if you're interested, just give Bill Gates a call and let him know you're interested in the position, although I kind of think they'll probably be looking at other...

1573
02:02:54,614 --> 02:02:56,295
[SPEAKER_03]: Big companies, tech companies.

1574
02:02:57,655 --> 02:03:00,916
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's where I insert my fan wank that they should hire Reggie Fils-Aimé.

1575
02:03:02,637 --> 02:03:03,277
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on, guys.

1576
02:03:03,737 --> 02:03:04,798
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you like that fan wank?

1577
02:03:06,358 --> 02:03:10,820
[SPEAKER_03]: No, we're talking about, for one, Reggie's obviously a very game-focused company.

1578
02:03:10,960 --> 02:03:15,142
[SPEAKER_03]: When we talk about the Microsoft CEO, that is much more than just Xbox.

1579
02:03:16,922 --> 02:03:22,084
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe they'll promote from within, kind of like how, you know, what they did when Don Mattrick left.

1580
02:03:22,444 --> 02:03:23,345
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what they need to do.

1581
02:03:23,605 --> 02:03:23,765
[SPEAKER_03]: Huh.

1582
02:03:25,103 --> 02:03:36,887
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that this would probably violate some contracts and stuff, but they need to hire fictional character Kevin Butler as president of Microsoft because it would be awesome.

1583
02:03:39,608 --> 02:03:46,111
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there anybody that jumps out at you who could be the person to jump in as CEO?

1584
02:03:46,131 --> 02:03:46,211
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1585
02:03:47,603 --> 02:03:47,843
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1586
02:03:48,824 --> 02:03:50,605
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know what else they could... Clippy.

1587
02:03:51,725 --> 02:03:52,366
[SPEAKER_03]: Clippy B?

1588
02:03:52,486 --> 02:03:53,366
[SPEAKER_02]: No, not Clippy.

1589
02:03:53,507 --> 02:03:56,428
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Clippy, the Microsoft Office Assistant.

1590
02:03:56,868 --> 02:03:57,089
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1591
02:03:57,469 --> 02:04:02,552
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know what they could do in good old American tradition to find the new CEO of Microsoft?

1592
02:04:04,613 --> 02:04:06,034
[SPEAKER_03]: Reality TV show.

1593
02:04:09,115 --> 02:04:11,457
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Microsoft's Idol.

1594
02:04:12,698 --> 02:04:13,418
[SPEAKER_03]: America Voted.

1595
02:04:16,805 --> 02:04:17,246
Anyhow.

1596
02:04:17,746 --> 02:04:19,067
[SPEAKER_03]: Another show for Seacrest to host.

1597
02:04:19,107 --> 02:04:19,367
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on.

1598
02:04:20,427 --> 02:04:21,147
[SPEAKER_03]: He does need work.

1599
02:04:22,108 --> 02:04:25,449
[SPEAKER_03]: No, he's going to be hosting an NBC game show coming up.

1600
02:04:25,509 --> 02:04:26,690
[SPEAKER_03]: The Million Second Quiz.

1601
02:04:27,230 --> 02:04:29,751
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is, and I know, oh God, I can't believe I'm going to admit this.

1602
02:04:30,152 --> 02:04:31,432
[SPEAKER_03]: There's an app that's available.

1603
02:04:31,452 --> 02:04:32,232
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a pretty long time.

1604
02:04:32,553 --> 02:04:34,213
[SPEAKER_03]: There's an app that's available.

1605
02:04:34,273 --> 02:04:34,654
[SPEAKER_03]: It's 11 days.

1606
02:04:34,694 --> 02:04:35,374
[SPEAKER_03]: A million seconds.

1607
02:04:36,014 --> 02:04:37,517
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I know, that's a pretty long time.

1608
02:04:51,517 --> 02:04:54,698
[SPEAKER_03]: when the guy won the million dollars and used his lifeline to call his dad.

1609
02:04:54,978 --> 02:04:57,158
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that was like epic television, right?

1610
02:04:57,178 --> 02:04:57,358
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1611
02:04:57,598 --> 02:04:58,418
[SPEAKER_03]: It was event television.

1612
02:04:58,438 --> 02:05:10,481
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why NBC's kind of trying to make that happen again because it's been a while since we've really had, you know, who wants to be a millionaire is kind of faded away into a, I shouldn't say faded away because now it's like a syndicated game show like your Jeopardy, like your Wheel of Fortune, you know, it's there.

1613
02:05:10,861 --> 02:05:13,782
[SPEAKER_03]: But NBC's trying to make this event game show happen again.

1614
02:05:14,182 --> 02:05:17,902
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've seen other networks try this like ABC had one a couple years ago called Duel.

1615
02:05:18,243 --> 02:05:20,443
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a pretty decent game but it just didn't really take off.

1616
02:05:20,703 --> 02:05:20,923
[SPEAKER_02]: Telephone.

1617
02:05:20,943 --> 02:05:21,223
[SPEAKER_02]: Telephone.

1618
02:05:46,641 --> 02:05:47,922
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, remember the telephone?

1619
02:05:48,382 --> 02:05:50,343
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, well now, what was that, 1999?

1620
02:05:50,963 --> 02:05:53,464
[SPEAKER_03]: So here we are 14 years later, now it's an iPad app.

1621
02:05:53,845 --> 02:06:08,952
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can actually download the Million Second Quiz iPad app, and I may be guilty of having played this, but you get matched up against other people, and you take a 10-question quiz, it's all multiple choice, and it's like a mixture of, like the same thing you would expect to see on Trivial Pursuit cards, right?

1622
02:06:09,212 --> 02:06:10,393
[SPEAKER_03]: And you have to pick the answer.

1623
02:06:11,053 --> 02:06:23,664
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, supposedly, and I don't know how this is going to work, but if you hit a certain benchmark score in the iPad app, you qualify as a line jumper to go beyond the real show when it debuts, I think, in a week or two.

1624
02:06:23,684 --> 02:06:25,606
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's coming up here pretty soon.

1625
02:06:25,626 --> 02:06:26,306
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm going to try it, I guess.

1626
02:06:26,406 --> 02:06:26,887
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, right?

1627
02:06:26,907 --> 02:06:33,433
[SPEAKER_03]: Because now when they say, oh, you might win money, like a million billion dollars or however much they're giving away.

1628
02:06:33,453 --> 02:06:34,433
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll take a few thousand.

1629
02:06:34,493 --> 02:06:34,694
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not...

1630
02:06:35,194 --> 02:06:49,331
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's how they make it event television by saying, you, Johnny America, sitting at home with your iPad, get the app now and you can be here sitting and winning all this money in a couple weeks or whatever.

1631
02:06:49,831 --> 02:06:50,312
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty good idea.

1632
02:06:52,324 --> 02:06:56,227
[SPEAKER_03]: How did talking about Steve Ballmer leave us to talking about NBC game shows?

1633
02:06:56,447 --> 02:07:01,510
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, but I agree with Codeman in the chatroom who says, at least it's not Candy Crush.

1634
02:07:02,050 --> 02:07:02,611
[SPEAKER_03]: True facts.

1635
02:07:02,671 --> 02:07:03,871
[SPEAKER_03]: Deleted that from my phone.

1636
02:07:03,911 --> 02:07:04,592
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.

1637
02:07:04,652 --> 02:07:05,412
[SPEAKER_03]: That was embarrassing.

1638
02:07:05,592 --> 02:07:06,413
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry about that.

1639
02:07:07,233 --> 02:07:12,217
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet you anything there will be a Candy Crush-themed game show at some point.

1640
02:07:12,237 --> 02:07:15,279
[SPEAKER_02]: Because wasn't there, like, a Hasbro-themed game show?

1641
02:07:15,299 --> 02:07:16,179
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there still is.

1642
02:07:16,199 --> 02:07:17,480
[SPEAKER_03]: There's still the Family Game Night.

1643
02:07:17,520 --> 02:07:18,521
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Family Game Night.

1644
02:07:21,162 --> 02:07:24,044
[SPEAKER_03]: Actdeft in chat says, imagine if Rob gets on that game show.

1645
02:07:24,164 --> 02:07:24,784
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, please.

1646
02:07:25,244 --> 02:07:33,609
[SPEAKER_03]: But it would also be nice if I won some money because then if I win enough money, I could possibly leave my day job and do VOG full time.

1647
02:07:33,629 --> 02:07:34,369
[SPEAKER_03]: Wouldn't that be fun?

1648
02:07:35,110 --> 02:07:36,210
[SPEAKER_03]: If I could win a million dollars?

1649
02:07:38,290 --> 02:07:39,512
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, forget it.

1650
02:07:40,533 --> 02:07:41,694
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on, more news.

1651
02:07:42,394 --> 02:07:50,402
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so Humble Bundle, the Origin Bundle, has earned a record-breaking $8.7 million.

1652
02:07:50,682 --> 02:07:57,909
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was based on 1.791 million bundles being sold.

1653
02:07:59,030 --> 02:08:01,272
[SPEAKER_02]: And average price, $486 million.

1654
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:12,849
[SPEAKER_02]: and I guess the record previous to that was 5.1 million with the Humble Indie Bundle 5.

1655
02:08:14,691 --> 02:08:16,613
[SPEAKER_02]: And they did add a few more games.

1656
02:08:16,633 --> 02:08:28,244
[SPEAKER_02]: They added Command & Conquer Red Alert 3 Uprising, not Red Alert 3, which would have been an awesome game, but Red Alert 3 Uprising, a four-level standalone expansion.

1657
02:08:30,613 --> 02:08:34,218
[SPEAKER_03]: Actdeft and ChatCorrecting, by the way, it's over 9 million now.

1658
02:08:35,579 --> 02:08:37,001
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, whatever.

1659
02:08:37,221 --> 02:08:39,423
[SPEAKER_02]: Populous and... Yes.

1660
02:08:40,565 --> 02:08:44,289
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that was it.

1661
02:08:44,909 --> 02:08:49,333
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the fact, by the way, even though Populous, you have to get it through Origin, whatever.

1662
02:08:49,953 --> 02:08:54,036
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the classic game back from... When did that game come out?

1663
02:08:54,336 --> 02:08:54,036
1989?

1664
02:08:54,376 --> 02:08:55,377
[SPEAKER_03]: It was on Super Nintendo.

1665
02:08:56,898 --> 02:08:57,678
[SPEAKER_03]: That game was awesome.

1666
02:08:58,639 --> 02:09:01,181
[SPEAKER_03]: I was very happy that they threw that in the bundle as well.

1667
02:09:01,701 --> 02:09:06,665
[SPEAKER_03]: What's so funny about it is because the game is so old, Origin actually has these prompts that says...

1668
02:09:07,425 --> 02:09:08,506
[SPEAKER_03]: and DarkSakura.com

1669
02:09:28,363 --> 02:09:29,364
[SPEAKER_03]: You can quit the DOS.

1670
02:09:29,524 --> 02:09:30,204
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, DOS.

1671
02:09:30,805 --> 02:09:32,826
[SPEAKER_03]: And then also, this is the funny thing.

1672
02:09:32,906 --> 02:09:36,708
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember how games back in the day, the copy protection was the manual?

1673
02:09:37,289 --> 02:09:39,750
[SPEAKER_03]: What is the third word on page 45 of the manual?

1674
02:09:39,870 --> 02:09:41,651
[SPEAKER_03]: Or use this chart in the back of the manual.

1675
02:09:41,711 --> 02:09:42,832
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was in Populous.

1676
02:09:42,852 --> 02:09:44,953
[SPEAKER_03]: You had to identify these crests in the game.

1677
02:09:44,993 --> 02:09:46,014
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's still in there.

1678
02:09:46,574 --> 02:09:52,458
[SPEAKER_03]: But they fixed it so that it says you can input any word and the game will accept it as the correct answer.

1679
02:09:53,178 --> 02:09:54,780
[SPEAKER_03]: So, like, what does this shield mean?

1680
02:09:55,100 --> 02:09:55,541
[SPEAKER_03]: Boobs.

1681
02:09:55,921 --> 02:09:56,522
[SPEAKER_03]: And it'll take it.

1682
02:09:56,702 --> 02:09:57,443
[SPEAKER_03]: That's correct!

1683
02:09:58,964 --> 02:09:59,665
[SPEAKER_02]: Sweet.

1684
02:09:59,745 --> 02:10:00,306
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

1685
02:10:02,441 --> 02:10:02,721
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1686
02:10:03,722 --> 02:10:04,022
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1687
02:10:04,322 --> 02:10:06,303
[SPEAKER_02]: And then something else about Origin.

1688
02:10:07,084 --> 02:10:08,805
[SPEAKER_02]: They're now allowing returns.

1689
02:10:08,965 --> 02:10:11,266
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, returns with an asterisk.

1690
02:10:11,907 --> 02:10:30,858
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, what's going to happen is if you buy a game on Origin and they have this now great game guarantee, if you're unsatisfied with your full game digital download from Origin, and this includes full games on pre-order and other discounts and stuff,

1691
02:10:31,398 --> 02:10:50,295
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe you'll be able to return it within 7 days so 7 days after purchase without activation or 24 hours after launching it for the first time so 24 hours if you've activated 7 days if you haven't activated the game

1692
02:10:51,992 --> 02:11:00,817
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting to see Origin and EA really making these big customer service grabs between the Humble Bundle and the great thing they're doing for charity.

1693
02:11:00,897 --> 02:11:06,041
[SPEAKER_03]: And I hate to make that sound opportunistic, but the reality is it's... It was opportunistic.

1694
02:11:06,321 --> 02:11:10,403
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's putting a lot of people in Origin's good graces right now.

1695
02:11:11,084 --> 02:11:17,508
[SPEAKER_03]: And now this, which is hard to say this isn't good news because I think it's great news.

1696
02:11:17,548 --> 02:11:17,908
[SPEAKER_03]: It isn't.

1697
02:11:18,908 --> 02:11:19,689
[SPEAKER_02]: It isn't terrible.

1698
02:11:19,949 --> 02:11:20,690
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not bad news.

1699
02:11:20,950 --> 02:11:21,490
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good news.

1700
02:11:22,831 --> 02:11:24,492
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good that they have that option in there.

1701
02:11:26,753 --> 02:11:29,855
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's good for a few reasons.

1702
02:11:30,095 --> 02:11:36,880
[SPEAKER_02]: One, if you run into a situation like SimCity where the whole launch was fucked up, you can get your money back, which is kind of cool.

1703
02:11:37,420 --> 02:11:44,004
[SPEAKER_02]: Or, for example, if you buy a game that just doesn't run well on your PC, then you can get your money back.

1704
02:11:44,024 --> 02:11:44,485
[SPEAKER_02]: That's huge.

1705
02:11:44,505 --> 02:11:45,325
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's pretty good.

1706
02:11:45,565 --> 02:11:46,646
[SPEAKER_03]: Or you just don't like it.

1707
02:11:46,846 --> 02:12:15,019
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah or you just don't like it so I think that's kind of cool that they have that in there I wish Steam would do something similar but let's be honest here this is far and away from like you know I'm selling a used copy of my game that I finished or something like that this is not anything like that this is just kind of like that almost like the Evil G used game thing where it's like okay within seven days you can return this you know except you know seven days without playing it um

1708
02:12:16,604 --> 02:12:19,265
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll give them props for at least having some sort of return.

1709
02:12:20,325 --> 02:12:28,527
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you said in passing, you said, I wish Steam would do something like this because, yeah, they don't really do refunds on Steam unless there's a huge... I mean, they've done it before, but it was like a huge thing.

1710
02:12:28,967 --> 02:12:37,949
[SPEAKER_03]: But this whole competition now, you know, if Origin does get more and more market share, it's going to force Steam to look into doing these types of things.

1711
02:12:40,430 --> 02:12:41,910
[SPEAKER_03]: to make themselves competitive.

1712
02:12:41,970 --> 02:12:42,590
[SPEAKER_03]: It's interesting.

1713
02:12:42,730 --> 02:12:51,593
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if they'll have to do that because I think what's going to end up happening is they're probably going to come out with some sort of way to sell or trade your game online using their services.

1714
02:12:51,633 --> 02:12:58,736
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's what's going to end up happening there so they may not have the whole returns thing.

1715
02:13:00,467 --> 02:13:02,789
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think this is a good direction.

1716
02:13:02,869 --> 02:13:08,994
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I can't say I'm going to go buy a bunch of games and then return them, but it does take that awkwardness out of returning things too.

1717
02:13:09,174 --> 02:13:09,735
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I don't know.

1718
02:13:10,075 --> 02:13:16,420
[SPEAKER_03]: I just don't like to go back to the store and return something because I feel like that guy, unless it's like very clearly broken or whatever.

1719
02:13:16,520 --> 02:13:18,382
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I just, who likes to be that guy?

1720
02:13:18,942 --> 02:13:21,344
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, some people do, but anyway.

1721
02:13:21,364 --> 02:13:22,105
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1722
02:13:22,605 --> 02:13:26,289
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you can be any guy or gal you want to be in a series known as Fable.

1723
02:13:26,910 --> 02:13:29,613
[SPEAKER_03]: And Fable Legends is a new game.

1724
02:13:30,454 --> 02:13:34,478
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a multiplayer game that's set in the universe of the other Fable games, Albion.

1725
02:13:35,239 --> 02:13:36,940
[SPEAKER_03]: It was announced at Gamescom.

1726
02:13:37,221 --> 02:13:40,444
[SPEAKER_03]: There will be a beta test actually happening next year.

1727
02:13:40,604 --> 02:13:42,006
[SPEAKER_03]: So not to be outdone by...

1728
02:13:42,706 --> 02:13:44,787
[SPEAKER_03]: Say Elder Scrolls Online on the PlayStation.

1729
02:13:45,467 --> 02:13:46,908
[SPEAKER_03]: Xbox will have Fable Legends.

1730
02:13:48,068 --> 02:13:52,870
[SPEAKER_03]: No release window for the game currently, but I would imagine if they're going to beta test it next year.

1731
02:13:53,051 --> 02:13:54,431
[SPEAKER_03]: No later than holiday next year.

1732
02:13:54,451 --> 02:13:55,912
[SPEAKER_02]: Holiday next year would be my guess.

1733
02:13:56,152 --> 02:13:59,053
[SPEAKER_03]: You can sign up on the game's website if you're interested in more information.

1734
02:13:59,153 --> 02:14:03,855
[SPEAKER_03]: FableLegends.com There's a little trailer and you can see all the other stuff they put out at Gamescom.

1735
02:14:03,875 --> 02:14:05,276
[SPEAKER_02]: It looked neat, but I'm sorry.

1736
02:14:05,496 --> 02:14:10,318
[SPEAKER_02]: After playing the last few Fable games, it's always so much hype and then they play...

1737
02:14:10,638 --> 02:14:37,795
[SPEAKER_02]: especially if they have Peter Molyneux talking about Fable oh my god you know they just hype it up so much and it's just kind of like yeah this is kind of very similar to the last Fable game um so I don't know it looks all right but I mean it'd be something my wife would be into I'm not buying it she loved the Fable games didn't I'm not buying an Xbox one for that game but you know my wife would probably be interested I forgot she really liked the Fable games huh yeah she plays through because she like what did she like to do really weird things in them didn't she

1738
02:14:39,795 --> 02:14:40,636
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought that's what it was.

1739
02:14:41,357 --> 02:14:42,779
[SPEAKER_03]: Does she play them good or evil?

1740
02:14:43,239 --> 02:14:44,100
[SPEAKER_03]: Good, usually.

1741
02:14:44,421 --> 02:14:45,022
[SPEAKER_03]: She tries to.

1742
02:14:45,502 --> 02:14:46,283
[SPEAKER_03]: That's good.

1743
02:14:47,645 --> 02:14:55,655
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well let's see if our emailers this week are good or evil in a segment we do every week here on the show called The Mailbag.

1744
02:14:56,778 --> 02:15:01,421
[SPEAKER_03]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send us emails each and every week.

1745
02:15:02,281 --> 02:15:06,824
[SPEAKER_03]: And in the absence of DarkSakura tonight, I will dive in the mailbag head first.

1746
02:15:07,885 --> 02:15:10,367
[SPEAKER_03]: And oh my gosh, it's pretty empty in here.

1747
02:15:11,192 --> 02:15:18,956
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the very, very, very bottom of this mailbag, way down there at the bottom, one email here for me to read tonight.

1748
02:15:19,097 --> 02:15:19,477
[SPEAKER_03]: One email.

1749
02:15:19,797 --> 02:15:20,217
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know what?

1750
02:15:20,257 --> 02:15:22,759
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of a long email, so it'll work.

1751
02:15:23,159 --> 02:15:25,440
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to email us for a future week, you know what?

1752
02:15:25,500 --> 02:15:29,382
[SPEAKER_03]: When DarkSakura gets back and she's over her allergies and all that, let's make her work.

1753
02:15:29,943 --> 02:15:31,544
[SPEAKER_03]: Give us like 10 emails for next week.

1754
02:15:31,784 --> 02:15:36,847
[SPEAKER_03]: If you can send 10 emails from 10 different people, I will get DarkSakura a taco.

1755
02:15:38,007 --> 02:15:38,648
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember that bet?

1756
02:15:40,549 --> 02:15:42,250
[SPEAKER_03]: Ragenator is our emailer tonight.

1757
02:15:42,270 --> 02:15:42,770
[SPEAKER_03]: Here we go.

1758
02:15:43,831 --> 02:15:47,212
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that we all in the VOG community have at least one thing in common.

1759
02:15:47,292 --> 02:15:48,273
[SPEAKER_03]: We're all gamers.

1760
02:15:49,894 --> 02:15:52,115
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to actually stop you right there.

1761
02:15:54,131 --> 02:15:56,313
[SPEAKER_03]: VOG is actually the voice of Geeks Network.

1762
02:15:56,714 --> 02:16:06,805
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, I think most of the people do play some games, but certainly not every show on VOG is about games.

1763
02:16:07,847 --> 02:16:12,452
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think we do have a couple hosts who maybe don't play nearly as many video games as the rest of us do.

1764
02:16:12,572 --> 02:16:12,953
[SPEAKER_03]: So please...

1765
02:16:13,433 --> 02:16:21,421
[SPEAKER_03]: Please do make that a note, even though OLR, Bobby Blackwolf, Girls Gone Wow, you know, we're all strictly about video games.

1766
02:16:21,982 --> 02:16:24,605
[SPEAKER_03]: Under Station Live dabbles in it, PodCulture dabbles in it.

1767
02:16:25,786 --> 02:16:27,588
[SPEAKER_03]: They are not strictly video games.

1768
02:16:28,228 --> 02:16:33,454
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyhow, I think you would be right in saying gaming is one big part of geek culture.

1769
02:16:34,314 --> 02:16:34,555
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow.

1770
02:16:35,563 --> 02:16:36,203
[SPEAKER_03]: He goes on to say,

1771
02:17:05,117 --> 02:17:05,838
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

1772
02:17:20,188 --> 02:17:21,349
[SPEAKER_03]: Call of Duty, Madden, Mortal Kombat

1773
02:17:36,820 --> 02:17:37,521
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

1774
02:17:57,122 --> 02:17:57,843
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

1775
02:18:15,638 --> 02:18:18,959
[SPEAKER_03]: This email has been brought to you by Bobby's googly-eyed Oculus Rift.

1776
02:18:19,359 --> 02:18:22,640
[SPEAKER_03]: Now if only DarkSakura can get him to use the damn thing to play Mass Effect.

1777
02:18:22,960 --> 02:18:24,140
[SPEAKER_03]: Garrus all the things.

1778
02:18:24,901 --> 02:18:27,201
[SPEAKER_03]: That email again from Ragenator.

1779
02:18:29,702 --> 02:18:32,403
[SPEAKER_03]: So the question from Ragenator, why gaming?

1780
02:18:33,023 --> 02:18:34,543
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll ask Loki here in a minute here.

1781
02:18:34,923 --> 02:18:37,924
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me read some of the answers from... No, no, let me go to Loki, actually.

1782
02:18:38,324 --> 02:18:39,344
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, why gaming?

1783
02:18:39,925 --> 02:18:40,245
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1784
02:18:40,265 --> 02:18:40,725
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just...

1785
02:18:42,445 --> 02:18:43,626
[SPEAKER_03]: Why do you play video games?

1786
02:18:44,686 --> 02:18:46,246
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they're fun.

1787
02:18:46,306 --> 02:18:49,127
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a medium, I guess, to play.

1788
02:18:49,327 --> 02:18:55,169
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's just like if you were to play with Legos or if you were to draw or you're going to do something else.

1789
02:18:55,249 --> 02:18:57,590
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, just, I don't know.

1790
02:18:57,610 --> 02:18:58,830
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just what I ended up doing.

1791
02:18:59,010 --> 02:19:03,692
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's what I started off early with, like, you know, PC games and stuff.

1792
02:19:04,072 --> 02:19:07,593
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I did other things other than just, you know,

1793
02:19:09,289 --> 02:19:10,371
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

1794
02:19:25,593 --> 02:19:26,214
[SPEAKER_02]: All sorts of stuff.

1795
02:19:26,274 --> 02:19:29,417
[SPEAKER_02]: And for some reason, it's just something that we do nowadays.

1796
02:19:29,477 --> 02:19:30,779
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, why watch TV?

1797
02:19:30,939 --> 02:19:32,000
[SPEAKER_02]: Why listen to the radio?

1798
02:19:32,020 --> 02:19:36,965
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's to the point now where video games are kind of like watching TV.

1799
02:19:37,045 --> 02:19:37,886
[SPEAKER_02]: It's that common.

1800
02:19:37,946 --> 02:19:40,628
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not really... It's like, why eat food?

1801
02:19:40,689 --> 02:19:40,929
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean...

1802
02:19:41,249 --> 02:19:42,730
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a little bit me too.

1803
02:19:43,090 --> 02:19:47,931
[SPEAKER_03]: If you go back to my senior year of high school and you look at me in the yearbook, I'm in six different clubs.

1804
02:19:48,632 --> 02:19:49,592
[SPEAKER_03]: And that doesn't even count.

1805
02:19:49,692 --> 02:19:51,653
[SPEAKER_03]: I used to do a public access TV show.

1806
02:19:51,673 --> 02:19:57,735
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people don't know about this because I don't want Travis Donovan ever finding the tapes of it because God knows what will happen.

1807
02:19:58,815 --> 02:20:01,796
[SPEAKER_03]: But I was doing all this stuff when I was a kid.

1808
02:20:01,836 --> 02:20:03,397
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think a lot of that was just because...

1809
02:20:04,637 --> 02:20:10,461
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if it was out of boredom or just out of the fact like, you know, when I was sitting at home doing nothing, I just felt really depressed.

1810
02:20:10,961 --> 02:20:14,264
[SPEAKER_03]: So I had to kind of get out and do these different things, and I just almost overdid it.

1811
02:20:14,564 --> 02:20:18,326
[SPEAKER_03]: And video games, to some extension, were a real social thing at that age.

1812
02:20:19,127 --> 02:20:26,011
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the reason why I got into it, to answer the question, actually very similar to what Raginator said at the beginning there.

1813
02:20:26,272 --> 02:20:33,737
[SPEAKER_03]: Being able to kind of control the pictures on the TV I think was a real kind of novel thing when you're like six years old, five years old, and very impressionable.

1814
02:20:35,419 --> 02:20:45,016
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to the chat room and some of the answers there let's see Brad from PogCulture says why not gaming?

1815
02:20:47,033 --> 02:20:51,455
[SPEAKER_03]: Black Wolf says, I don't do underwater basket weaving because I don't have a pool.

1816
02:20:53,176 --> 02:20:54,416
[SPEAKER_03]: There is no place to practice.

1817
02:20:55,616 --> 02:20:57,857
[SPEAKER_03]: But a game console is cheaper than a backyard pool.

1818
02:20:59,978 --> 02:21:01,699
[SPEAKER_03]: Degenerate Johnny says, why gaming?

1819
02:21:01,739 --> 02:21:04,740
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it makes me harder than Peter North in a Bukkake festival.

1820
02:21:04,940 --> 02:21:05,240
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

1821
02:21:06,461 --> 02:21:06,721
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

1822
02:21:08,476 --> 02:21:10,118
[SPEAKER_03]: Where every gamer has a voice, I guess.

1823
02:21:10,999 --> 02:21:16,485
[SPEAKER_03]: SSJ100Matt with a far more serious answer saying, Escapism is the thing for some people.

1824
02:21:17,206 --> 02:21:17,587
[SPEAKER_03]: Certainly.

1825
02:21:18,167 --> 02:21:24,455
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, DarkSakura is still listening to the show, and she sent an answer over private message here, because if she were here, I'd ask her what she says.

1826
02:21:24,495 --> 02:21:28,360
[SPEAKER_03]: So she told me over chat, she says, I had a rotten childhood, and I would hide in books.

1827
02:21:28,820 --> 02:21:29,280
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

1828
02:21:49,640 --> 02:22:02,295
[SPEAKER_03]: as far as why I like it over another medium it's that again that process of immersion having an active hand in what happens in the game makes it a lot better than being a passive participant so there you go

1829
02:22:04,614 --> 02:22:13,781
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think, you know, I use this kind of example today as like some of my friends ask me like, wow, you play a lot of World of Warcraft.

1830
02:22:13,842 --> 02:22:14,742
[SPEAKER_03]: Aren't you addicted?

1831
02:22:14,822 --> 02:22:16,484
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you addicted to World of Warcraft?

1832
02:22:16,504 --> 02:22:19,726
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I go, well, how have you spent your free time?

1833
02:22:19,806 --> 02:22:22,789
[SPEAKER_03]: You've watched every single episode of Lost twice.

1834
02:22:23,249 --> 02:22:23,990
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you addicted?

1835
02:22:24,150 --> 02:22:25,271
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you addicted to Lost?

1836
02:22:25,671 --> 02:22:26,392
[SPEAKER_03]: Game of Thrones?

1837
02:22:26,432 --> 02:22:27,372
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you addicted to that?

1838
02:22:27,553 --> 02:22:31,456
[SPEAKER_02]: TV tells me that you're addicted to, wow, because you can't just like it.

1839
02:22:31,496 --> 02:22:32,517
[SPEAKER_02]: You must be addicted.

1840
02:22:33,277 --> 02:22:34,018
[SPEAKER_02]: TV, TV.

1841
02:22:34,378 --> 02:23:02,643
[SPEAKER_03]: so yeah it's like yeah I may play a lot of video games but if you ask me like what movies I've seen lately I see maybe 10% of what I really want to see I saw the first half of Plains yesterday and you asked me about TV shows I'm especially clueless the fact that I watched Orange is the New Black from start to finish says a lot about that show because there's very few shows I've watched from start to finish very few so there you go

1842
02:23:04,864 --> 02:23:05,445
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, that's it.

1843
02:23:05,625 --> 02:23:06,667
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the only email tonight.

1844
02:23:06,727 --> 02:23:12,176
[SPEAKER_03]: So mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com if you would like to send us an email for a future week.

1845
02:23:12,917 --> 02:23:16,002
[SPEAKER_03]: In the meantime, let's get to the FUs of the week.

1846
02:23:16,322 --> 02:23:18,466
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is the part of the show where we give our angst.

1847
02:23:34,828 --> 02:23:37,511
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, well, Loki, would you like to start us off tonight?

1848
02:23:37,811 --> 02:23:45,037
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, uh, big fuck you to Cyclist, because you're always in my goddamn way on the street.

1849
02:23:45,157 --> 02:23:53,244
[SPEAKER_02]: There's this guy that was in front of me today, you know, not on a bike lane or anything, just kind of in the middle of the goddamn street, riding his bike super goddamn slow.

1850
02:23:53,844 --> 02:24:01,851
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't go around him, because if I go try to, you know, share the lane with him and go around him, then I might hit him, and that would be bad, so...

1851
02:24:03,152 --> 02:24:04,252
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, fuck that.

1852
02:24:04,813 --> 02:24:06,773
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, what is up with all these people?

1853
02:24:07,173 --> 02:24:18,117
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that you're not on a fucking team practicing for the race, but wearing your stupid, like, skin-tight, you know, uniforms with all your sponsors on there.

1854
02:24:18,437 --> 02:24:19,697
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, but no.

1855
02:24:20,077 --> 02:24:21,738
[SPEAKER_02]: Fat dude wearing that.

1856
02:24:22,078 --> 02:24:23,238
[SPEAKER_02]: You do not have sponsors.

1857
02:24:23,278 --> 02:24:24,119
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not in a race.

1858
02:24:24,139 --> 02:24:25,459
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not practicing for a race.

1859
02:24:25,679 --> 02:24:26,519
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't understand it.

1860
02:24:26,760 --> 02:24:27,880
[SPEAKER_02]: My boss has, like...

1861
02:24:28,380 --> 02:24:54,013
[SPEAKER_03]: a group of people that he rides with and they all have like jean uniforms and stuff it's ridiculous you're not in races okay you don't have sponsors what the hell all right uh DarkSakura sending her FUs uh by private messages she wants you all to know FU to my fucking sinuses which makes sense uh and 115 school books for one fucking class oh my god a lot of money um

1862
02:24:54,153 --> 02:25:00,757
[SPEAKER_03]: My FU of the week goes to construction on Highway 80 between Vacaville and Dixon.

1863
02:25:01,137 --> 02:25:02,117
[SPEAKER_03]: You suck.

1864
02:25:02,458 --> 02:25:07,880
[SPEAKER_03]: And I realize, look, construction workers don't hard... Construction workers work hard.

1865
02:25:08,261 --> 02:25:09,942
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't blame you personally.

1866
02:25:10,362 --> 02:25:15,565
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you have to do that stuff, but here's the thing that pissed me off about it is that there was no warning.

1867
02:25:15,665 --> 02:25:21,988
[SPEAKER_03]: If you know traffic is going to be backed up at 1.30 in the morning for one hour, have

1868
02:25:22,088 --> 02:25:23,528
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

1869
02:25:45,595 --> 02:25:51,019
[SPEAKER_03]: I would have sympathy if they chose to show an abducted child message over a construction message.

1870
02:25:51,039 --> 02:25:51,880
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd be okay with that.

1871
02:25:52,080 --> 02:25:58,204
[SPEAKER_03]: But to show nothing at all that warns me, hey, try taking a back road is a little bit irritating.

1872
02:25:58,224 --> 02:26:03,448
[SPEAKER_03]: You didn't know that this month is California Repave the Road Month.

1873
02:26:03,628 --> 02:26:05,330
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Spare the Air Day tomorrow.

1874
02:26:05,430 --> 02:26:07,131
[SPEAKER_02]: God, Spare the Air Day!

1875
02:26:07,271 --> 02:26:08,011
[SPEAKER_02]: Spare the Air!

1876
02:26:11,303 --> 02:26:11,603
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow.

1877
02:26:12,664 --> 02:26:15,146
[SPEAKER_03]: Or click it or tick it.

1878
02:26:15,766 --> 02:26:19,089
[SPEAKER_03]: What else do they put on those Amber Alert signs that have nothing to do with their purpose?

1879
02:26:19,689 --> 02:26:20,590
[SPEAKER_03]: Report drunk drivers.

1880
02:26:20,670 --> 02:26:21,751
[SPEAKER_03]: Report drunk drivers.

1881
02:26:21,791 --> 02:26:22,751
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's some of the...

1882
02:26:23,900 --> 02:26:39,248
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of this stuff is important, and I'm not trying to belittle it, but I sometimes feel like when they do this, it's like when the text message... Remember when they sent the Amber Alert text message to everybody at 2 in the morning about the kid that got kidnapped?

1883
02:26:40,008 --> 02:26:42,049
[SPEAKER_03]: Tons of people disabled it right after that.

1884
02:26:42,169 --> 02:26:43,090
[SPEAKER_03]: Why did they do that?

1885
02:26:43,530 --> 02:26:47,392
[SPEAKER_03]: Are they assholes that don't care about kids?

1886
02:26:48,112 --> 02:26:53,295
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's because that hideous thing showed up on people's phones at 2 in the morning going...

1887
02:26:53,935 --> 02:26:54,095
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow.

1888
02:27:20,211 --> 02:27:20,932
[SPEAKER_03]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1889
02:27:39,105 --> 02:27:40,146
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1890
02:27:56,144 --> 02:28:00,328
[SPEAKER_02]: And then at the end of the trailer, also announced the bundle that was going to be coming out.

1891
02:28:01,228 --> 02:28:04,051
[SPEAKER_02]: And thankfully, there are some people that took screen caps.

1892
02:28:04,571 --> 02:28:06,273
[SPEAKER_02]: And what is this new bundle going to have in it?

1893
02:28:06,293 --> 02:28:19,924
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's basically a Wii U, black Wii U system with the gamepad having what looks like a decal on it with some, you know, the Zelda, like, flourishes and stuff.

1894
02:28:19,944 --> 02:28:21,246
[SPEAKER_02]: There's, like, some little bit of gold...

1895
02:28:24,401 --> 02:28:24,841
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1896
02:28:48,213 --> 02:28:49,574
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of a hard sell.

1897
02:28:49,794 --> 02:28:58,359
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, when other systems like the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3 are $199, that's a lot of games you can buy in between that.

1898
02:28:58,779 --> 02:29:02,481
[SPEAKER_02]: Granted, it's not Zelda, but this is not technically a new Zelda either.

1899
02:29:02,661 --> 02:29:14,007
[SPEAKER_02]: It is an HD remake that you're trying to convince people to buy a system for a brand new Zelda, which it's not.

1900
02:29:15,205 --> 02:29:20,212
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure they'll announce said brand new Zelda next year, but there's still a lot of ways to go from there, right?

1901
02:29:20,232 --> 02:29:25,420
[SPEAKER_02]: If you put a demo for brand new Zelda on that disc, then you're talking.

1902
02:29:25,820 --> 02:29:26,802
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's true.

1903
02:29:26,962 --> 02:29:28,344
[SPEAKER_03]: Then those things will go flying.

1904
02:29:30,186 --> 02:29:30,507
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

1905
02:29:31,488 --> 02:29:34,250
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, unfortunately, some sad news to end on tonight.

1906
02:29:35,511 --> 02:29:38,253
[SPEAKER_03]: And that has to do with a studio closure.

1907
02:29:39,174 --> 02:29:43,937
[SPEAKER_03]: Seattle-based studio Big Fish has gone through a round of layoffs.

1908
02:29:44,338 --> 02:29:52,604
[SPEAKER_03]: It is closing its Vancouver studio and has gone into a 30-day consultation period about its Cork, Ireland operations.

1909
02:29:53,604 --> 02:29:57,085
[SPEAKER_03]: CEO Paul Thelen sent a letter to staff that talked about the changes.

1910
02:29:57,425 --> 02:30:04,127
[SPEAKER_03]: They talked about 49 layoffs in its Seattle headquarters and another 70 employees realigned.

1911
02:30:04,768 --> 02:30:07,088
[SPEAKER_03]: 524 full-time employees in Seattle previously.

1912
02:30:07,729 --> 02:30:08,989
[SPEAKER_03]: 9% of the studio cut.

1913
02:30:09,869 --> 02:30:20,934
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to stress that our decisions are not based on company-wide performance or that of the people working on these initiatives, both of which are strong, but because of where the market is growing and, quite frankly, where it is not.

1914
02:30:21,395 --> 02:30:26,577
[SPEAKER_03]: The most significant decision we are making today is that we are discontinuing our premium cloud delivery business.

1915
02:30:27,057 --> 02:30:32,342
[SPEAKER_03]: This service is not growing as fast as we had hoped it would and is not on a path to profitability.

1916
02:30:43,032 --> 02:30:43,993
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1917
02:31:02,597 --> 02:31:03,757
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching.

1918
02:31:03,817 --> 02:31:04,738
[SPEAKER_03]: See you next time.

1919
02:31:20,683 --> 02:31:22,124
[SPEAKER_03]: That does it for news tonight.

1920
02:31:22,445 --> 02:31:23,886
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to open up the Skype line.

1921
02:31:24,286 --> 02:31:26,989
[SPEAKER_03]: It is time for us to open up the Skype line and get some calls.

1922
02:31:28,030 --> 02:31:37,117
[SPEAKER_03]: Our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, or you can still call us on the good old telephone, 1-877-GAME-OLR is where you can call us.

1923
02:31:38,358 --> 02:31:40,739
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

1924
02:31:41,059 --> 02:31:44,600
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of calls, there's this weird new thing happening on Skype.

1925
02:31:44,640 --> 02:31:47,381
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if I should talk about it, but I think we're getting spam voicemails.

1926
02:31:48,182 --> 02:31:55,904
[SPEAKER_03]: I seriously had seven voicemails throughout the week from random numbers, but I would try to click play because I thought, oh, maybe somebody's actually leaving us a bumper.

1927
02:31:55,965 --> 02:31:57,265
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it's actually a new listener.

1928
02:31:57,525 --> 02:31:59,066
[SPEAKER_03]: But I click play and nothing happens.

1929
02:31:59,126 --> 02:32:02,587
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I go, all the voicemails are the same length.

1930
02:32:02,907 --> 02:32:04,568
[SPEAKER_03]: They're all four minutes and 22 seconds.

1931
02:32:04,608 --> 02:32:05,048
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like,

1932
02:32:05,848 --> 02:32:27,504
[SPEAKER_03]: that's probably spam probably tell me to go to some website and put in my social security number for a chance at some credit card or something lame alright well somebody's calling in on the phone right now so let's see what happens when we pick up the phone and go do it hi you're on Orange Launch Radio who's this hey it's Jim Sally guy hey Jim Sally what's up buddy

1933
02:32:28,675 --> 02:32:32,597
[SPEAKER_06]: I totally forgot you guys have an old school telephone man sitting on your show.

1934
02:32:32,757 --> 02:32:34,818
[SPEAKER_03]: We do have the old school telephone sitting on the show.

1935
02:32:34,838 --> 02:32:38,340
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I was surprised to hear from you on it because usually you call us on Skype.

1936
02:32:38,580 --> 02:32:40,641
[SPEAKER_03]: Were you just wanting to test that it still worked?

1937
02:32:42,822 --> 02:32:46,884
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm outside in my garage and the Skype lady was saying she didn't like my Skype.

1938
02:32:47,344 --> 02:32:48,345
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I'm sorry about that.

1939
02:32:48,585 --> 02:32:51,386
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to call you and be all choppy on the Skype line.

1940
02:32:52,347 --> 02:32:54,708
[SPEAKER_03]: So Jim Sally, to what do we owe this phone call tonight?

1941
02:32:55,869 --> 02:32:58,210
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to give my own little fuck you of the day today.

1942
02:32:58,735 --> 02:32:58,975
[SPEAKER_06]: Go for it.

1943
02:32:58,995 --> 02:32:59,275
[SPEAKER_06]: Go for it.

1944
02:33:26,280 --> 02:33:32,504
[SPEAKER_06]: It said I'd have a fucking paid subscription if I wanted to use goddamn Internet Explorer on my Microsoft machine.

1945
02:33:32,764 --> 02:33:35,565
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep, you want to use any of that premium shit.

1946
02:33:35,705 --> 02:33:37,406
[SPEAKER_03]: It's behind the freaking paywall.

1947
02:33:38,447 --> 02:33:40,788
[SPEAKER_06]: Why didn't the fucking Internet Explorer premium?

1948
02:33:40,848 --> 02:33:42,549
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the shittiest browser out there.

1949
02:33:44,070 --> 02:33:46,331
[SPEAKER_06]: They should apologize to me when I turn it on.

1950
02:33:46,511 --> 02:33:48,793
[SPEAKER_06]: If I make me pay for it.

1951
02:33:49,233 --> 02:33:51,074
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I went to go to YouTube.

1952
02:33:51,154 --> 02:33:51,514
[SPEAKER_06]: It's okay.

1953
02:33:53,379 --> 02:33:56,341
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuckin' Sesame Street videos and motherfuckin' YouTube don't work.

1954
02:33:56,641 --> 02:33:59,162
[SPEAKER_02]: It's okay, they make up for it by letting you use Bing.

1955
02:34:01,143 --> 02:34:02,804
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my fucking god.

1956
02:34:02,864 --> 02:34:03,664
[SPEAKER_06]: Bing doesn't work either.

1957
02:34:03,685 --> 02:34:06,346
[SPEAKER_06]: You go to Bing and you search something and it says you gotta pay for shit.

1958
02:34:06,646 --> 02:34:08,187
[SPEAKER_06]: You go and look for what's on your Xbox.

1959
02:34:09,482 --> 02:34:10,823
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that would be nice.

1960
02:34:11,203 --> 02:34:14,064
[SPEAKER_03]: They should allow you to set your... Maybe we should do this.

1961
02:34:14,124 --> 02:34:20,707
[SPEAKER_03]: Set up some type of website on OrangeLaunchRadio.com that you could set your home browser to in Internet Explorer on Xbox.

1962
02:34:20,727 --> 02:34:26,850
[SPEAKER_03]: That way, every time you open the browser, it would take you to a page that says, Welcome to Internet Explorer 10 on the Xbox.

1963
02:34:27,090 --> 02:34:27,891
[SPEAKER_03]: We're very sorry.

1964
02:34:31,581 --> 02:34:33,942
[SPEAKER_03]: What else doesn't work that I'm going to find out now?

1965
02:34:49,727 --> 02:34:51,108
[SPEAKER_06]: The X button on the fucking controller?

1966
02:34:51,128 --> 02:34:51,648
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe that doesn't work.

1967
02:34:51,668 --> 02:34:52,129
[SPEAKER_06]: Netflix doesn't work?

1968
02:34:52,149 --> 02:34:52,949
[SPEAKER_06]: If I pay for Netflix, it doesn't work?

1969
02:34:52,969 --> 02:34:53,190
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck, man.

1970
02:34:53,210 --> 02:34:54,651
[SPEAKER_03]: They can go suck a dick.

1971
02:35:14,298 --> 02:35:20,162
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you Microsoft for making my decision to buy a Playstation 3 so much fucking easier

1972
02:35:38,459 --> 02:35:46,765
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I was considering buying an Xbox One for the pass-through, because I do use the Xbox to communicate with people, but fuck, I bet you my Messenger doesn't work anymore now.

1973
02:35:46,805 --> 02:35:50,929
[SPEAKER_06]: I bet you my Amazon Messenger doesn't work anymore on my fucking Xbox.

1974
02:35:50,969 --> 02:35:51,489
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck Xbox, man!

1975
02:35:54,201 --> 02:35:55,301
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck Xbox, everybody.

1976
02:35:55,321 --> 02:35:55,942
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't buy one.

1977
02:35:56,462 --> 02:35:59,363
[SPEAKER_06]: Just always put the Kylo on this shit.

1978
02:35:59,763 --> 02:36:00,444
[SPEAKER_06]: Buy an iPad.

1979
02:36:00,464 --> 02:36:01,224
[SPEAKER_06]: The game's free.

1980
02:36:01,244 --> 02:36:02,024
[SPEAKER_06]: It's fucking better.

1981
02:36:02,464 --> 02:36:23,773
[SPEAKER_02]: You know the one thing I'm kind of sad about with these new systems is that they don't have... They only have HDMI out, and they don't have options for... I understand, like, component and stuff, you know, would have been nice, but, like, I play a lot on a PC monitor that has just a VGA in, and I'm sure there's a cable I could get, but it's going to be an elaborate setup just to play

1982
02:36:24,493 --> 02:36:25,554
[SPEAKER_02]: on a VGA monitor.

1983
02:36:25,734 --> 02:36:32,560
[SPEAKER_02]: I really wish they'd have that so I could use a VGA cable like they had with the Xbox 360, because I get a lot of use out of that.

1984
02:36:35,763 --> 02:36:36,443
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I agree.

1985
02:36:36,483 --> 02:36:38,485
[SPEAKER_06]: The Xbox One, whatever.

1986
02:36:38,705 --> 02:36:39,586
[SPEAKER_06]: Everyone forget about it.

1987
02:36:39,846 --> 02:36:41,547
[SPEAKER_06]: Just buy a PlayStation 4.

1988
02:36:41,928 --> 02:36:43,349
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not just the Xbox One.

1989
02:36:43,409 --> 02:36:45,070
[SPEAKER_02]: PlayStation 4 or 2 does the same thing.

1990
02:36:45,451 --> 02:36:49,454
[SPEAKER_02]: It kind of sucks, because there's only really one TV I can play that on.

1991
02:36:50,335 --> 02:36:52,997
[SPEAKER_02]: Or I'd do PC monitor, which I really don't want to.

1992
02:36:54,045 --> 02:36:54,826
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1993
02:37:16,920 --> 02:37:21,664
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'd really encourage, you know, those looking for podcasting tips or whatever, take a look on the forums.

1994
02:37:21,764 --> 02:37:24,486
[SPEAKER_03]: But is this something that might happen, Jim Sally?

1995
02:37:24,526 --> 02:37:26,828
[SPEAKER_03]: We looking at a Jim Sally show coming soon?

1996
02:37:27,108 --> 02:37:27,689
[SPEAKER_06]: We are, man.

1997
02:37:27,729 --> 02:37:29,630
[SPEAKER_06]: We're doing a little experimentation episode.

1998
02:37:29,650 --> 02:37:36,296
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not going to be... I always thought I'd have to do a video game show, but even Bobby says don't even worry about video game shows on the VOG Network.

1999
02:37:36,676 --> 02:37:38,057
[SPEAKER_06]: He wants lots of other stuff.

2000
02:37:38,738 --> 02:37:45,363
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're going to do a... It's called Jim Sally's Macho Man, where Jim Sally teaches geeks how to be macho men.

2001
02:37:46,412 --> 02:37:47,514
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of us are too geeky.

2002
02:37:48,054 --> 02:37:50,197
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't know how to do things like drive a fucking stick.

2003
02:37:52,901 --> 02:38:00,312
[SPEAKER_06]: I have my friends that can drive a stick in Gran Turismo all day long, and then they get into my little Porsche and they can't back it out of my driveway.

2004
02:38:01,154 --> 02:38:02,496
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of love this idea.

2005
02:38:02,556 --> 02:38:07,019
[SPEAKER_03]: As long as it stays on that line of being tongue-in-cheek and not insulting, but I know you can do it.

2006
02:38:07,160 --> 02:38:08,300
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you can do it, Jim Sally.

2007
02:38:08,320 --> 02:38:09,061
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it would be funny.

2008
02:38:09,081 --> 02:38:13,405
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, a little bit insulting, because you should macho up, but then obviously teach the person how to do something.

2009
02:38:14,446 --> 02:38:14,686
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

2010
02:38:15,006 --> 02:38:20,531
[SPEAKER_03]: Jim Sally, I'm going to let you go so we can get more calls, but it's always a delight to hear from you, and look forward to your new show soon.

2011
02:38:21,758 --> 02:38:23,800
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright everybody, stay tuned for more.

2012
02:38:23,840 --> 02:38:24,741
[SPEAKER_06]: Good night everybody.

2013
02:38:24,821 --> 02:38:25,682
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, night Jim Sally.

2014
02:38:25,722 --> 02:38:26,943
[SPEAKER_06]: Good night.

2015
02:38:26,983 --> 02:38:30,586
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want to send Jamie a special message?

2016
02:38:31,687 --> 02:38:33,769
[SPEAKER_06]: Jamie, I want to send you a special message right now.

2017
02:38:33,909 --> 02:38:36,151
[SPEAKER_06]: Right now I'm snuggling my pillow and I'm sending it to you.

2018
02:38:36,656 --> 02:38:41,539
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just squeezing the sinuses juice right out of you.

2019
02:38:41,619 --> 02:38:43,120
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, gushing out of your nose.

2020
02:38:43,660 --> 02:38:45,061
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, can you feel it?

2021
02:38:45,581 --> 02:38:47,562
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah, Jamie, that's for you, baby.

2022
02:38:47,602 --> 02:38:52,565
[SPEAKER_06]: Jim Sally, I'm going to leave you to your pillow, Jim Sally.

2023
02:38:52,585 --> 02:38:53,646
[SPEAKER_06]: Good night, Jim Sally.

2024
02:38:53,666 --> 02:38:53,746
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye.

2025
02:39:05,753 --> 02:39:07,696
[SPEAKER_03]: That wasn't creepy or anything.

2026
02:39:10,301 --> 02:39:14,329
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie's in chat right now going, ew, the snot is everywhere now.

2027
02:39:17,769 --> 02:39:26,336
[SPEAKER_03]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call.

2028
02:39:27,437 --> 02:39:29,559
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, do you have any last minute stories?

2029
02:39:30,019 --> 02:39:34,463
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I was going to talk about the release of a homebrew game for the Nintendo DS.

2030
02:39:35,744 --> 02:39:41,909
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called Aperture Science DS and as you might imagine, it is a DS version of Portal.

2031
02:39:42,709 --> 02:39:59,722
[SPEAKER_02]: and you can download it for free on smelium.net it's S-M-E-A-L-U-M dot net slash A-S-D-S Aperture Science DS so check that out it looks pretty impressive actually for a DS game

2032
02:40:00,342 --> 02:40:01,523
[SPEAKER_02]: For homebrew, I guess, too.

2033
02:40:01,563 --> 02:40:02,983
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's pretty impressive.

2034
02:40:05,465 --> 02:40:05,845
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

2035
02:40:06,065 --> 02:40:08,727
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, the GamePop.

2036
02:40:08,927 --> 02:40:09,487
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember them?

2037
02:40:09,947 --> 02:40:13,109
[SPEAKER_02]: They're one of those Android consoles that we kind of forgot about.

2038
02:40:13,469 --> 02:40:17,771
[SPEAKER_02]: But GamePop was the one that had the monthly service that you would subscribe to, I guess.

2039
02:40:19,452 --> 02:40:26,356
[SPEAKER_02]: And they've actually announced some partnerships with different mobile game developers, including TinyCo, who does Tiny Village.

2040
02:40:27,236 --> 02:40:52,394
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, Animaca, I guess Pretty Pet Salon, and Creative Mobile, which does the drag racing franchise, also, uh, Halfbrick with, you know, the Jetpack Joyride guys, uh, Vector Unit, who do Riptide GP, and Glue, Heroes of Destiny, and they're saying that they're gonna have about 500 games available when the GamePop launches in winter, and, uh,

2041
02:40:53,874 --> 02:40:58,676
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so it's going to be, I think if I remember correctly, it's like a streaming model.

2042
02:40:59,097 --> 02:41:12,083
[SPEAKER_02]: So you would be able to get a free mini model that requires a $6.99 monthly subscription or the more powerful model of the console, which is $129, but the subscription service is still required.

2043
02:41:12,823 --> 02:41:22,910
[SPEAKER_02]: and then also GamePop games I guess can be played with a smartphone as well instead of just the controller if you really want to.

2044
02:41:23,251 --> 02:41:30,096
[SPEAKER_02]: Although why the hell would you buy a gaming console to play on your phone when you can just play these games on your phone to begin with?

2045
02:41:30,316 --> 02:41:34,138
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, sometimes with the Wii U you're going to play on the tablet.

2046
02:41:34,178 --> 02:41:35,299
[SPEAKER_02]: But remember it's not all a card.

2047
02:41:35,339 --> 02:41:37,501
[SPEAKER_02]: It's $6.99 and you get access to 500 games so there's that too.

2048
02:41:37,521 --> 02:41:37,661
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

2049
02:41:42,037 --> 02:41:42,377
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

2050
02:41:42,978 --> 02:41:45,839
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me give another call for the Skype line if you want to give us a call.

2051
02:41:46,439 --> 02:41:48,000
[SPEAKER_03]: Boy, Bobby didn't get any calls tonight either.

2052
02:41:48,020 --> 02:41:48,780
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody's shy tonight.

2053
02:41:48,800 --> 02:41:52,943
[SPEAKER_03]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2054
02:41:52,963 --> 02:41:54,243
[SPEAKER_03]: At least we got Jim Sally.

2055
02:41:54,283 --> 02:41:57,805
[SPEAKER_03]: If nothing else, God bless Jim Sally.

2056
02:41:57,825 --> 02:42:02,007
[SPEAKER_03]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2057
02:42:02,387 --> 02:42:04,348
[SPEAKER_03]: In the meantime, I want to get to Twitter topics here.

2058
02:42:05,689 --> 02:42:07,830
[SPEAKER_03]: Trying to bring it up on my iPad right now.

2059
02:42:08,330 --> 02:42:10,851
[SPEAKER_03]: Except I had the Rocky Horror Picture Show up on my iPad.

2060
02:42:13,113 --> 02:42:15,915
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, just a couple tweets tonight from Tigerclaw.

2061
02:42:16,636 --> 02:42:18,017
[SPEAKER_03]: Tigerclaw sending us a couple tweets.

2062
02:42:18,377 --> 02:42:23,601
[SPEAKER_03]: One of them, a Metroid fan film Kickstarter taken down over IP dispute with Nintendo.

2063
02:42:23,961 --> 02:42:26,043
[SPEAKER_03]: Does this surprise anybody?

2064
02:42:26,103 --> 02:42:26,303
[SPEAKER_03]: Nope.

2065
02:42:26,784 --> 02:42:29,446
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm surprised somebody thought they could get away with it.

2066
02:42:30,066 --> 02:42:33,528
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey guys, it's Degenerate Johnny Hey Degenerate Johnny, how you doing buddy?

2067
02:42:56,300 --> 02:42:56,861
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I'm bad.

2068
02:42:56,901 --> 02:42:57,622
[SPEAKER_07]: Can't complain.

2069
02:42:58,323 --> 02:42:58,824
[SPEAKER_03]: Good to hear from you.

2070
02:42:58,844 --> 02:42:59,985
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to apologize.

2071
02:43:00,005 --> 02:43:03,350
[SPEAKER_07]: I kind of missed most of last week's show.

2072
02:43:04,344 --> 02:43:06,966
[SPEAKER_07]: I was over at Gen Con last week.

2073
02:43:07,486 --> 02:43:07,946
[SPEAKER_03]: That's okay.

2074
02:43:08,046 --> 02:43:11,208
[SPEAKER_03]: I understood you sent in an email to the show and we somehow missed it.

2075
02:43:11,328 --> 02:43:19,612
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't purposely omit it, but I worry that we get a lot of spam at our email address and it might have been accidentally thrown in.

2076
02:43:19,633 --> 02:43:21,033
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, I totally understand that.

2077
02:43:21,854 --> 02:43:24,555
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to call people's attention to the VOG Network forums.

2078
02:43:24,575 --> 02:43:29,538
[SPEAKER_03]: You posted your poem that you'd written there and it was brilliant, so I just want to make sure people see it.

2079
02:43:30,979 --> 02:43:32,520
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, alright, I appreciate it.

2080
02:43:32,660 --> 02:43:33,020
[SPEAKER_03]: No worries.

2081
02:43:34,798 --> 02:43:35,318
[SPEAKER_07]: So what's up?

2082
02:43:35,838 --> 02:43:36,099
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

2083
02:43:36,639 --> 02:43:36,979
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2084
02:43:37,059 --> 02:43:40,380
[SPEAKER_07]: So I was going to let you guys know.

2085
02:43:40,440 --> 02:43:46,303
[SPEAKER_07]: I just came across, during my time at Gen Con, I came across a certain game.

2086
02:43:47,783 --> 02:43:54,046
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think you guys have covered it, but I might as well just let you guys know.

2087
02:43:54,086 --> 02:44:02,509
[SPEAKER_07]: I played around with it, and I know we're talking about Hearthstone and all that, but this game, wow.

2088
02:44:03,150 --> 02:44:03,930
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a card game.

2089
02:44:04,481 --> 02:44:06,262
[SPEAKER_07]: but the MMO card game.

2090
02:44:06,442 --> 02:44:06,682
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

2091
02:44:06,742 --> 02:44:09,563
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if you guys have heard of it.

2092
02:44:09,683 --> 02:44:11,864
[SPEAKER_07]: It's called Hex Shards of Fate.

2093
02:44:13,785 --> 02:44:17,466
[SPEAKER_03]: The title sounds familiar but I don't know much about it.

2094
02:44:17,526 --> 02:44:23,068
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like it's one of those games we probably had a rapid fire news story on at one point and I didn't really look into it.

2095
02:44:23,929 --> 02:44:26,249
[SPEAKER_03]: But you have my attention.

2096
02:44:26,309 --> 02:44:27,170
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell us more about it.

2097
02:44:28,630 --> 02:44:29,031
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

2098
02:44:29,071 --> 02:44:29,671
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I know.

2099
02:44:29,711 --> 02:44:31,371
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like MMO card game.

2100
02:44:31,391 --> 02:44:32,292
[SPEAKER_07]: What the hell?

2101
02:44:32,332 --> 02:44:32,732
[SPEAKER_05]: Sounds great.

2102
02:44:33,411 --> 02:44:36,676
[SPEAKER_07]: It's being developed by Cryptozoic Games.

2103
02:44:36,916 --> 02:44:44,727
[SPEAKER_07]: They are the ones that, for those who listen to Horde House, Cryptozoic has a license for the World of Warcraft games.

2104
02:44:46,146 --> 02:44:48,847
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I don't know if you heard about this, Degenerate Johnny.

2105
02:44:49,147 --> 02:44:58,829
[SPEAKER_03]: Blizzard announced this week, I'll throw this in here as a last-minute story, that the latest expansion of the WoW trading card game is the last, and that they are no longer going to be making it.

2106
02:44:58,849 --> 02:45:02,990
[SPEAKER_03]: They are ending that relationship, and there's no plans in the future to continue the WoW trading card game.

2107
02:45:03,470 --> 02:45:09,011
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if that's because of Hearthstone or what, but I thought I would throw that little nugget out there just because I read that the other day.

2108
02:45:09,091 --> 02:45:09,771
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, sorry.

2109
02:45:10,611 --> 02:45:13,412
[SPEAKER_07]: I heard about that, actually, at Gen Con.

2110
02:45:13,432 --> 02:45:15,292
[SPEAKER_07]: I was talking with one of the Cryptozote guys, and

2111
02:45:15,765 --> 02:45:18,746
[SPEAKER_07]: They did mention that it was going to be the last expansion.

2112
02:45:19,647 --> 02:45:28,271
[SPEAKER_07]: Their relationship has matured with Blizzard to a degree that now they're going to develop their own type of games.

2113
02:45:28,911 --> 02:45:33,693
[SPEAKER_07]: I think this Hex Shards of Fate game is actually evidence of that.

2114
02:45:36,714 --> 02:45:38,415
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just wowed about it.

2115
02:45:38,995 --> 02:45:41,957
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically, Hex Shards of Fate is a...

2116
02:45:43,240 --> 02:46:10,565
[SPEAKER_07]: It actually had a Kickstarter earlier this summer, actually, and they just wanted a Kickstarter just to finish off the game, but they managed to get like seven times the amount that they were asking for it, so now it's going to be able to be available for Apple tablets and Android tablets, so lots of stuff is going on with this game, and

2117
02:46:11,209 --> 02:46:12,469
[SPEAKER_07]: It's actually pretty exciting.

2118
02:46:12,729 --> 02:46:17,530
[SPEAKER_07]: It's due to be released in sometime this holiday season.

2119
02:46:17,810 --> 02:46:18,251
[SPEAKER_03]: It's free to play.

2120
02:46:18,271 --> 02:46:20,071
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually following probably the same type of business model as

2121
02:46:34,178 --> 02:46:37,679
[SPEAKER_07]: Blizzard is doing with Hearthstone, basically $2 a pack.

2122
02:46:37,959 --> 02:46:40,740
[SPEAKER_07]: However, they're also adding a freemium service.

2123
02:46:40,800 --> 02:47:03,267
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you want to have a discount on your packs and gain access to tournaments free of charge, they're offering a VIP access, which is basically $4 a month type of thing, kind of like a subscription, but you get a pack every week.

2124
02:47:04,093 --> 02:47:05,575
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, okay.

2125
02:47:05,835 --> 02:47:07,657
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a card of the month club.

2126
02:47:08,198 --> 02:47:09,379
[SPEAKER_03]: The card of the week club.

2127
02:47:09,479 --> 02:47:13,744
[SPEAKER_03]: Just say cancel at any time and we'll stop sending you the cards.

2128
02:47:14,285 --> 02:47:14,926
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of funny.

2129
02:47:15,246 --> 02:47:16,207
[SPEAKER_07]: Right, exactly.

2130
02:47:16,588 --> 02:47:24,337
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so it's going to have an auction house for you to trade your cards, buy

2131
02:47:24,853 --> 02:47:29,895
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, there's so much information, and I just want to let you know that they are going to be at DragonCon.

2132
02:47:30,695 --> 02:47:31,155
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, cool.

2133
02:47:31,175 --> 02:47:38,918
[SPEAKER_07]: So, anybody who's going to go there, or if you, or Bobby, you know, if anybody wants to see around, they will be at DragonCon, so you can see it for yourself.

2134
02:47:39,315 --> 02:48:03,612
[SPEAKER_03]: Degenerate Johnny, I thought of you recently because I know you're a big card game fan and a friend of mine introduced me to a card game and I did the whole thing where I actually went to the comic book shop and played this game with my friends he was actually doing a lot of demos with this game at GamerX so I want to give a shout out to this game because it was a lot of fun totally not the game you called in to talk about tonight but I hijacked your call, I'm sorry but the game is called Sentinels of the Multiverse have you played this?

2135
02:48:05,954 --> 02:48:07,615
[SPEAKER_07]: I've seen it being played at

2136
02:48:09,255 --> 02:48:10,276
[SPEAKER_07]: Sounds very familiar.

2137
02:48:10,296 --> 02:48:16,459
[SPEAKER_07]: It sounds kind of similar to Lord of the Rings because Lord of the Rings is a game where you basically go up against a

2138
02:48:38,365 --> 02:48:46,227
[SPEAKER_07]: Deck, that it's not you, but it's not another player, it's just you taking on scenarios.

2139
02:48:46,667 --> 02:48:50,928
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can do it in co-op, so you can be in your own fellowship.

2140
02:48:50,968 --> 02:49:05,932
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's very interesting, and I'm seeing that it's pretty interesting that card games are now making the rise of basically you don't have to find someone to play with, you can play it with yourself, or

2141
02:49:06,480 --> 02:49:06,841
[SPEAKER_07]: and so on.

2142
02:49:18,218 --> 02:49:19,219
[SPEAKER_07]: what's the name of the game again?

2143
02:49:19,439 --> 02:49:45,559
[SPEAKER_03]: Sentinels of the Multiverse and we actually might get the guy on one of the shows later on or one of the developers of the game because I don't think it would be a good fit for OLR but I'm going to see if some of the other VOG shows are interested in it so if not we'll do a Google Hangout or something but yeah anyway Degenerate Johnny I should probably let you go so we can wrap up the show but thanks for your call always a pleasure to hear from you my pleasure take care

2144
02:49:46,110 --> 02:49:47,653
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys take care.

2145
02:49:47,794 --> 02:49:48,114
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye-bye.

2146
02:50:00,518 --> 02:50:02,420
[SPEAKER_03]: A couple other tweets here from some listeners.

2147
02:50:02,540 --> 02:50:04,861
[SPEAKER_03]: If you do want to give us a call, we can try to squeeze in one more call.

2148
02:50:04,881 --> 02:50:08,324
[SPEAKER_03]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio.

2149
02:50:08,945 --> 02:50:10,126
[SPEAKER_03]: TigerClaw sends us a tweet.

2150
02:50:10,466 --> 02:50:12,067
[SPEAKER_03]: Blizzard on World of Warcraft.

2151
02:50:12,107 --> 02:50:13,688
[SPEAKER_03]: We'd be lost without casuals.

2152
02:50:13,989 --> 02:50:18,652
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, before I get to that, I should... TigerClaw sent in that tweet on Metroid Fan Film.

2153
02:50:19,072 --> 02:50:26,939
[SPEAKER_03]: He wanted to clarify, make sure we report on the fact that the fan film was only going to be 10 minutes and non-for-profit, but they were asking for $90,000 to fund it.

2154
02:50:26,979 --> 02:50:27,059
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

2155
02:50:29,160 --> 02:50:29,581
[SPEAKER_03]: 10 minutes?

2156
02:50:29,681 --> 02:50:30,262
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on.

2157
02:50:30,302 --> 02:50:32,164
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe they were going to actually film in space.

2158
02:50:32,324 --> 02:50:32,745
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

2159
02:50:33,526 --> 02:50:34,387
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't read up on it.

2160
02:50:35,468 --> 02:50:36,730
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, look.

2161
02:50:36,750 --> 02:50:38,592
[SPEAKER_03]: We got another call coming in, so let's go to it.

2162
02:50:38,612 --> 02:50:39,633
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2163
02:50:39,653 --> 02:50:40,014
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's this?

2164
02:50:40,755 --> 02:50:42,237
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, this is Ragenator.

2165
02:50:42,277 --> 02:50:42,938
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, Ragenator.

2166
02:50:42,958 --> 02:50:43,498
[SPEAKER_03]: How you doing?

2167
02:50:44,339 --> 02:50:45,280
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I guess.

2168
02:50:45,361 --> 02:50:46,382
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a webcam call.

2169
02:50:46,402 --> 02:50:46,862
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to see you.

2170
02:50:53,163 --> 02:51:16,674
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it's been mentioned either last week or the week before although you did mention some news that was kind of sort of related I think it was last week and the week before you mentioned that Microsoft is getting rid of the Microsoft coins and they also in turn they're getting rid of the games for Windows Marketplace

2171
02:51:17,675 --> 02:51:25,301
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that was not mentioned is that they're getting rid of the Zune marketplace.

2172
02:51:28,023 --> 02:51:39,132
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, I found this out through an email that Microsoft had sent out to me not too long ago.

2173
02:51:40,773 --> 02:51:46,998
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way it's been explained to me, the reason why they're getting rid of the Zune marketplace is because

2174
02:51:48,115 --> 02:51:59,403
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, apparently the Zoom Microfaces set up in such a way that it would only recognize Microsoft points as a method of payment.

2175
02:51:59,463 --> 02:52:08,830
[SPEAKER_00]: They won't recognize dollars and cents or pesos or euros or whatever your local currency happens to be.

2176
02:52:08,850 --> 02:52:09,951
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, right.

2177
02:52:12,222 --> 02:52:23,624
[SPEAKER_00]: To catch 22 is, if you have an Xbox 360, you'll still be able to use the 12-in-2.

2178
02:52:24,004 --> 02:52:26,925
[SPEAKER_03]: But with the old tech, you're screwed, basically.

2179
02:52:27,605 --> 02:52:27,925
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

2180
02:52:29,465 --> 02:52:38,307
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this is why, Reginator, knowing a company's exit strategy for the inevitable day that they close their doors in the day and age of digital distribution is so important.

2181
02:52:38,687 --> 02:53:06,859
[SPEAKER_03]: and I think that's one reason everybody kind of goes to Steam a little bit because Steam has made it very clear should we ever close our doors we have the magic button that we can press that will make all the games DRM free and you won't have to connect to the servers anymore but you know when we talk about movies and music and so forth that really sucks if you were one of those people who actually invested in a Zune and it's like okay you'll have those movies but you can't really use the Zune now for anything else or like my HD DVD player

2182
02:53:08,236 --> 02:53:29,787
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the weird thing is, at least with me, ever since Sony burned me a handful of times, when I still had my PlayStation 3, I had to send my system in to get repaired to have my VOs reactivated, I slowly but surely made my way over to the Zoom service and been getting...

2183
02:53:31,273 --> 02:53:34,554
[SPEAKER_00]: TV shows and movies and this and that.

2184
02:53:35,115 --> 02:53:42,297
[SPEAKER_00]: Granted, the vast majority of the stuff were the freebies, but I do have my fair share of the paid content.

2185
02:53:42,918 --> 02:53:55,823
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, case in point, I've just been going to 90's and VOG music soundtrack whenever I've been getting

2186
02:53:57,999 --> 02:54:05,724
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been using this service for my PC because I don't have iTunes or anything I happen to have.

2187
02:54:16,399 --> 02:54:25,101
[SPEAKER_00]: Xbox accounts set up for when I still had the 360, so no need for extra passwords, remembers, so on and so forth.

2188
02:54:26,521 --> 02:54:37,084
[SPEAKER_03]: Ragenator, this is kind of a crap situation, but unfortunately, this is the downside to tech, and especially when our tech advances so fast.

2189
02:54:37,144 --> 02:54:39,004
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think tough lesson learned.

2190
02:54:39,424 --> 02:54:46,365
[SPEAKER_03]: always take a look at that user license agreement even though you're not going to sit there and read all 27 pages or 99 pages or however long it is.

2191
02:54:46,765 --> 02:54:51,846
[SPEAKER_03]: Look for that part that talks about who really owns the stuff that you're buying and what's going to happen.

2192
02:54:52,286 --> 02:54:57,887
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway, Ragenator, we're going to wrap up so we can wrap up the show but any quick other thoughts you want to get out before we let you go?

2193
02:54:58,727 --> 02:54:59,487
[SPEAKER_00]: No, there'll be.

2194
02:54:59,547 --> 02:55:05,909
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to really mention the closing of that particular service since it really wasn't mentioned before.

2195
02:55:06,329 --> 02:55:06,769
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

2196
02:55:07,149 --> 02:55:07,349
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

2197
02:55:07,389 --> 02:55:07,989
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, take care, buddy.

2198
02:55:08,009 --> 02:55:08,489
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for the call.

2199
02:55:09,335 --> 02:55:10,056
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, have a good one.

2200
02:55:10,176 --> 02:55:10,697
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, you too.

2201
02:55:10,897 --> 02:55:11,037
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye-bye.

2202
02:55:11,057 --> 02:55:11,197
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye-bye.

2203
02:55:11,958 --> 02:55:13,459
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, did I already check?

2204
02:55:13,479 --> 02:55:14,020
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we have anything else?

2205
02:55:14,040 --> 02:55:14,460
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that's it.

2206
02:55:31,718 --> 02:55:32,798
[SPEAKER_03]: No more last minute stories.

2207
02:55:33,558 --> 02:55:34,159
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let me see.

2208
02:55:34,199 --> 02:55:37,839
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I had one other tweet here that I wanted to do.

2209
02:55:39,940 --> 02:55:46,742
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, TheGarthWolf sent us a tweet that says, I totally got into the XIV Coral server tonight.

2210
02:55:47,222 --> 02:55:50,222
[SPEAKER_03]: Got to play the intro quest and now maintenance just started.

2211
02:55:50,282 --> 02:55:51,063
[SPEAKER_03]: Just my luck.

2212
02:55:51,483 --> 02:55:56,784
[SPEAKER_03]: We were talking a little bit about the Final Fantasy XIV, kind of the bumpy launch they've been having.

2213
02:55:57,264 --> 02:56:00,925
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's just hope in a week it's all a distant memory.

2214
02:56:01,545 --> 02:56:04,148
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I want to make sure I got this one in.

2215
02:56:04,188 --> 02:56:05,709
[SPEAKER_03]: Grandpa from Horde House sent this tweet.

2216
02:56:05,729 --> 02:56:07,871
[SPEAKER_03]: I almost forgot it because he sent it earlier in the day.

2217
02:56:09,653 --> 02:56:10,714
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's a video.

2218
02:56:12,375 --> 02:56:21,524
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, long story short, it's another one of those freaking sensationalistic CNN things where an eight-year-old shot his 90-year-old caretaker and it was because of a violent video game.

2219
02:56:21,544 --> 02:56:26,128
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think, don't quote me on this, but I think this is the one that Piers Morgan on his Twitter said,

2220
02:56:26,728 --> 02:56:34,314
[SPEAKER_03]: wrote out there and said, don't tell me after hearing things like this that violent video games don't cause violent behavior and da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da, blah-blah-blah.

2221
02:56:34,574 --> 02:56:51,508
[SPEAKER_03]: So here we go again with the media, you know, well, and this is a nightmare that an eight-year-old boy would shoot his 90-year-old caretaker, but who was letting an eight-year-old game play violent video games unsupervised?

2222
02:56:51,588 --> 02:56:53,389
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not blaming the 90-year-old.

2223
02:56:53,449 --> 02:56:55,791
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm blaming the parents.

2224
02:56:55,811 --> 02:56:56,011
All right.

2225
02:56:56,031 --> 02:56:57,032
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

2226
02:57:25,083 --> 02:57:25,464
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

2227
02:57:25,904 --> 02:57:26,545
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we're done.

2228
02:57:27,586 --> 02:57:32,353
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been a crazy show tonight, but we're on out of here for the next two weeks.

2229
02:57:33,754 --> 02:57:35,657
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you guys, as always, for listening to our show.

2230
02:57:35,737 --> 02:57:36,558
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for your download.

2231
02:57:36,598 --> 02:57:37,419
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for your support.

2232
02:57:37,780 --> 02:57:40,123
[SPEAKER_03]: We always appreciate you supporting Independent Radio.

2233
02:57:41,084 --> 02:57:43,307
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully you liked what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio.

2234
02:57:43,687 --> 02:57:47,149
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you didn't, just be sure to support other independent broadcasters.

2235
02:57:47,430 --> 02:57:51,993
[SPEAKER_03]: There's many people out there working very hard to put these types of shows together.

2236
02:57:52,313 --> 02:57:54,294
[SPEAKER_03]: And we all appreciate your support so much.

2237
02:57:54,734 --> 02:57:57,696
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm not going to ask you for your money or a financial donation.

2238
02:57:58,377 --> 02:58:01,219
[SPEAKER_03]: But I will ask, if you like what you heard, spread the word.

2239
02:58:01,319 --> 02:58:03,280
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell a friend or two about the show.

2240
02:58:03,680 --> 02:58:07,543
[SPEAKER_03]: Post a nice five-star review on iTunes or give us a thumbs up in Stitcher or whatever.

2241
02:58:07,923 --> 02:58:13,287
[SPEAKER_03]: Help us spread the word about the show because that is all the marketing that we can afford is word of mouth.

2242
02:58:14,807 --> 02:58:16,668
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, any last-minute thoughts tonight?

2243
02:58:17,128 --> 02:58:23,129
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to just try to finish up Saints Row 4 this week, maybe even tonight, because I'm almost at 100%.

2244
02:58:23,169 --> 02:58:24,609
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about how to do it.

2245
02:58:25,190 --> 02:58:25,690
[SPEAKER_03]: You can do it.

2246
02:58:26,590 --> 02:58:37,332
[SPEAKER_03]: My final thought is I hope I get to play at least another hour of Final Fantasy XIV tonight, but we'll see if that stupid maintenance finishes right at the time I get home from picking up Alan.

2247
02:58:37,352 --> 02:58:38,293
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be fantastic.

2248
02:58:38,673 --> 02:58:39,573
[SPEAKER_03]: Fantastic timing.

2249
02:58:40,353 --> 02:58:43,556
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well that does it for another week here at Orange Lounge Radio.

2250
02:58:43,596 --> 02:58:45,117
[SPEAKER_03]: We will be back in two weeks.

2251
02:58:45,217 --> 02:58:47,639
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a great Labor Day, those of you guys here in the States.

2252
02:58:47,980 --> 02:58:50,062
[SPEAKER_03]: For those of you in other countries, have a great week.

2253
02:58:50,982 --> 02:58:56,287
[SPEAKER_03]: Enjoy your time and have fun playing the various online games that are launching over the next two weeks.

2254
02:58:56,627 --> 02:59:01,772
[SPEAKER_03]: We will be back for another show live Sunday, September 8th.

2255
02:59:02,432 --> 02:59:04,634
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll see you then with another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

2256
02:59:04,874 --> 02:59:05,355
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a great night.

2257
02:59:05,996 --> 02:59:09,018
[SPEAKER_01]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

2258
02:59:09,659 --> 02:59:13,881
[SPEAKER_01]: Orange Lounge Radio is a production of OLR Studios.

2259
02:59:14,462 --> 02:59:23,348
