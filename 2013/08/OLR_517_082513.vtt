WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:21.080
The PlayStation 4's launch is detailed, League of Legends experiences a security breach,

00:21.080 --> 00:31.480
and you can soon return digital copies of games in one online store.

00:31.480 --> 00:34.800
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

00:34.800 --> 00:41.580
where every gamer has a voice, it is Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 517 for this

00:41.580 --> 00:44.880
August the 25th of 2013.

00:44.880 --> 00:51.040
Pull up a chair in our live chat room, live.vognetwork.com where you can participate with the pro

00:51.040 --> 00:54.800
program as we talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

00:54.800 --> 01:00.720
My name's Rob Roberts, here with you as always every week, my co-hosts say hello to DarkSakura

01:00.720 --> 01:01.720
or Jamie Summers.

01:01.720 --> 01:02.720
Hi.

01:02.720 --> 01:03.720
Hi, how are you?

01:03.720 --> 01:04.720
Sniffy.

01:04.720 --> 01:06.080
Yeah, you sound, you are having hecka allergies today.

01:06.080 --> 01:11.640
Or something, I was just, this morning I woke up and was really congested and it's all

01:11.640 --> 01:13.640
cytus too because it's all just in my nose.

01:13.640 --> 01:18.360
I know the city where we're based, Sacramento, California is not a very pleasant one for

01:18.360 --> 01:23.160
allergy sufferers, but I always thought that was more of a spring thing, so you can get

01:23.160 --> 01:25.000
it pretty bad this time of year too.

01:25.000 --> 01:28.520
I don't even know what set it off really, I mean, it may have been left over from the

01:28.520 --> 01:31.880
fires, it could have been, I don't know, but.

01:31.880 --> 01:37.920
Oh yeah, those fires, there's these horrible fires burning outside of Yosemite, this big

01:37.920 --> 01:42.080
national park that's, now it's really far, well, you know, it's probably what, like a

01:42.080 --> 01:43.080
five, six hour drive from here.

01:43.080 --> 01:44.920
Also, it caused a minor heat wave for us.

01:44.920 --> 01:49.360
But, oh yeah, I mean, it's really burning out of control, so I don't think I know anybody

01:49.360 --> 01:53.680
in the OLR listening base that lives in that area, but if you do, I really hope you're

01:53.680 --> 01:58.360
safe and taking care of yourself, you know, and my thoughts go out to you guys, because

01:58.360 --> 02:00.280
pretty terrible, that fire out there.

02:00.280 --> 02:06.000
I've had Benadryl and Sudafed and I even laid down, well, it just doesn't seem to be doing

02:06.000 --> 02:07.760
much good, so.

02:07.760 --> 02:09.440
Well, I hope you feel better.

02:09.440 --> 02:10.440
I'm not sick.

02:10.440 --> 02:12.000
Despite all the fires and all that.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.280
I feel awful though.

02:13.640 --> 02:18.480
Well, feel better if you need more coffee, because coffee helps.

02:18.480 --> 02:19.840
I'm full of Ricolas now.

02:19.840 --> 02:23.400
Well, speaking of our hometown of Sacramento, I wanted to mention this real quick with you,

02:23.400 --> 02:28.560
and we referenced this on Bobby Black Wolf's show, just before we went live tonight, but

02:28.560 --> 02:32.600
here in Sacramento, California, you know, once in a while we get celebrities, because

02:32.600 --> 02:37.140
they come up here from Hollywood to lobby for different bills and so forth.

02:37.140 --> 02:38.520
Or in this case, come from England.

02:38.520 --> 02:43.040
Yes, or we used to have a governor, but I won't go there, you all know about that.

02:43.040 --> 02:44.800
But in this case, in town.

02:44.800 --> 02:46.400
That's actually happened twice.

02:46.400 --> 02:47.400
That's true.

02:47.400 --> 02:48.400
That's true, because there was Reagan.

02:48.400 --> 02:50.880
Yeah, he was a famous movie actor too.

02:50.880 --> 02:57.120
But anyway, past all the politics stuff, Democrat, Republican and everything in between, doesn't

02:57.120 --> 02:59.200
matter who you are, you love John Barrowman.

02:59.200 --> 03:00.200
Oh, yes.

03:00.200 --> 03:04.360
If you know who he is, we'll get to that in a minute, because Tech Master Loki had no

03:04.360 --> 03:11.500
idea who he was, but he's from Doctor Who and Torchwood and what he was one of the people

03:11.500 --> 03:13.420
and the new producers.

03:13.420 --> 03:18.700
He also was on a couple of series in England where it was like, one of them was How Do

03:18.700 --> 03:22.500
You Solve a Problem, like Maria, where they cast for West End plays.

03:22.500 --> 03:23.820
He did stage stuff and all that.

03:23.820 --> 03:26.420
It's basically like American Idol for stage theater.

03:26.420 --> 03:34.080
And he's just, no matter your sexuality or who you are, you have to admit, he is a very

03:34.080 --> 03:36.260
gorgeous, handsome man.

03:36.260 --> 03:39.580
So a lot of people like him for that reason alone.

03:39.660 --> 03:42.820
But he's here in Sacramento and we can't figure out why.

03:42.820 --> 03:44.940
There's a big nerd convention coming up next weekend.

03:44.940 --> 03:46.740
Can't he just be in town?

03:46.740 --> 03:49.140
I guess, but I'm kind of like, well, why would he?

03:49.140 --> 03:51.780
And I'm even thinking about the little bit I know about him.

03:51.780 --> 03:55.700
His family's in Florida and the rest of his, and he lives in England.

03:55.700 --> 03:56.700
Who knows?

03:56.700 --> 03:59.860
Maybe, maybe he came to San Francisco and thought he'd swing by.

03:59.860 --> 04:04.660
But here's my hope, since he's supposed to be at Dragon Con in a few days, as am I.

04:04.660 --> 04:09.260
I got my fingers on my toes crossed that we might be on the same flight.

04:09.260 --> 04:14.220
I don't pray very often, but if anybody up there is listening, I want to be on the same

04:14.220 --> 04:16.340
flight as John Barrowman to Atlanta.

04:16.340 --> 04:18.100
Five and a half hours on a plane with John Barrowman.

04:18.100 --> 04:19.100
Yes, please.

04:19.100 --> 04:20.700
What are you flying?

04:20.700 --> 04:21.700
Delta.

04:21.700 --> 04:25.180
It's the only one that had a direct flight to Atlanta.

04:25.180 --> 04:26.180
It might have a first class.

04:26.180 --> 04:27.180
You know?

04:27.180 --> 04:28.180
Yeah, I think they do.

04:28.180 --> 04:29.940
I wonder if, I wonder if his husband came along.

04:29.940 --> 04:30.940
I think so.

04:30.940 --> 04:31.940
I think he was in the pictures.

04:31.940 --> 04:32.940
All right.

04:32.940 --> 04:33.940
Anyway, listeners are here.

04:33.940 --> 04:35.020
They're entirely too cute together.

04:35.020 --> 04:39.980
They're here to hear about video games, not to hear about John Barrowman, although quite

04:39.980 --> 04:42.060
frankly, who's going to complain?

04:42.060 --> 04:44.140
Maybe Techmaster Loki will complain.

04:44.140 --> 04:45.940
Hey, Techmaster Loki, how you doing?

04:45.940 --> 04:46.940
Doing good.

04:46.940 --> 04:47.940
Yeah?

04:47.940 --> 04:50.820
Well, we need to edumacate you on who John Barrowman is.

04:50.820 --> 04:51.820
You should Google him or something.

04:51.820 --> 04:52.820
Yeah, I did.

04:52.820 --> 04:53.820
I still don't know who he is.

04:53.820 --> 04:54.820
Did you?

04:54.820 --> 04:55.820
It didn't look familiar, huh?

04:55.820 --> 04:56.820
Nope.

04:56.820 --> 05:01.500
All right, go into our chat room, live.vognetwork.com, because we do tape live at the Voice of Geeks

05:01.500 --> 05:05.300
Network every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after

05:05.300 --> 05:09.880
the Bobby Black Wolf show, and Brad from Pod Culture in there saying, John Barrowman grabbed

05:09.880 --> 05:17.220
my cohost Adam's ass in a photo op, and I bet Adam didn't wash that ass for an entire

05:17.220 --> 05:18.220
week.

05:18.220 --> 05:19.220
Or at least the jeans attached to the ass.

05:19.220 --> 05:22.820
At least the jeans attached to them.

05:22.820 --> 05:26.780
Tekanist in chat suggesting I make friends with a stewardess.

05:26.780 --> 05:27.780
I may have to.

05:27.780 --> 05:30.580
They're called flight attendants now.

05:30.580 --> 05:33.620
Alan Alchemy says, Rob, you aren't in first class, though.

05:33.620 --> 05:37.900
That doesn't mean I won't still find a way to run into him.

05:37.900 --> 05:40.020
Don't question my powers.

05:40.020 --> 05:44.700
All right, anyhow, Loki, how have you been?

05:44.700 --> 05:47.700
What's new with you?

05:47.700 --> 05:48.700
Not a whole ton.

05:48.700 --> 05:54.740
So, I thought of you earlier today, because apparently all this Grand Theft Auto 5 information

05:54.740 --> 05:58.740
is leaking to the internet, and at first I thought, oh my gosh, there's a pirated version

05:58.740 --> 06:02.460
of the game out there already, and those poor guys are gonna, you know, lose those

06:02.460 --> 06:06.440
sales because it's already out there on the internet when we're weeks away from launch.

06:06.440 --> 06:08.460
But that's not totally the case, right, Loki?

06:08.460 --> 06:10.260
What's going on in the Grand Theft Auto world?

06:10.260 --> 06:17.620
The European region had the digital version of it that people had preordered, became live

06:17.620 --> 06:23.500
for a little bit, so, not necessarily live, but you can preload it, so people were downloading

06:23.500 --> 06:30.460
the 18 gig file to their PS3, and of course, you know, they would dump it and, you know,

06:30.460 --> 06:34.500
try to hack it to get it to run and stuff, but they haven't really been able to hack

06:34.500 --> 06:35.500
it.

06:35.500 --> 06:38.660
I don't think that they're gonna get it to run either, because, and there's, you know,

06:38.660 --> 06:45.020
this guy, Good NTS, or, I think it's Good NTS, he does, like, he is one of the ones

06:45.020 --> 06:51.420
that developed all the tools for hacking Grand Theft Auto, basically, he says there's no

06:51.420 --> 06:57.180
way to, like, open up the archives yet, because they don't have the keys to do that, and I

06:57.180 --> 07:01.100
don't think that the executable is included with that, I think that's what comes in the

07:01.100 --> 07:07.380
patch, so even if you could, you know, hack it, there's that day one patch when it finally

07:07.380 --> 07:11.580
goes live that brings the executable in, and, you know, until you have the executable, you're

07:11.580 --> 07:13.560
not gonna build it too much with it.

07:13.560 --> 07:18.620
But they have been dumping stuff out of it, including all the cutscene audio and audio

07:18.620 --> 07:19.620
from the game.

07:19.660 --> 07:22.380
You know, WhatUpG in our chatroom says the soundtrack leaked.

07:22.380 --> 07:27.820
Yeah, so the soundtrack's leaked, and a lot of the spoilers from the game have leaked

07:27.820 --> 07:31.660
as well, because they have all the cutscene audio, so there, people are documenting it.

07:31.660 --> 07:35.460
I've been pretty good in trying to stay away from all that stuff, I did read one thing,

07:35.460 --> 07:40.000
but it, you know, I kind of figured some of the people from the other games would be coming

07:40.000 --> 07:45.060
back in the game, like in one, like a cameo or something like that, so it's not a huge

07:45.060 --> 07:49.140
deal, but, you know, I'm trying not to read any spoilers in the game.

07:49.140 --> 07:51.580
Wow, you're usually the first to spoil everything.

07:51.580 --> 07:56.020
No, no, no, I never do, I never try to spoil myself when it comes to, you know, a lot of

07:56.020 --> 07:57.020
these things.

07:57.020 --> 07:58.020
When it comes to holy things.

07:58.020 --> 08:04.100
Well, it kind of, just like, I try not to spoil anything, now, if there was a working

08:04.100 --> 08:08.180
version out there that leaked through the internet, that's a whole nother story, so.

08:08.180 --> 08:10.460
That's not necessarily spoiling, you're playing through the game.

08:10.460 --> 08:12.140
No, that's, you know, I intend on-

08:12.140 --> 08:13.140
Illegally.

08:13.140 --> 08:14.140
Illegally.

08:14.140 --> 08:16.940
I intend, eh, whatever, you know what, I intend on purchasing on both platforms, so-

08:16.940 --> 08:17.940
I know-

08:17.940 --> 08:18.940
I don't care.

08:18.940 --> 08:20.140
I know you, Loki.

08:20.140 --> 08:23.980
If it did leak, you would be downloading it and playing it, and yes, you'd be one of those

08:23.980 --> 08:27.060
bad people, but you would still be buying two copies of it.

08:27.060 --> 08:28.340
Oh, yeah, absolutely, so.

08:28.340 --> 08:30.540
That's why I'm not giving you a worse time about it.

08:30.540 --> 08:34.540
Yeah, I'm still, you know, I'm buying it on both platforms, just so I can play with my

08:34.540 --> 08:38.140
friends, because I don't know what platform they're going to play on.

08:38.140 --> 08:41.820
You know, I still want to play on 360, because I like the controller better, but, you know,

08:41.820 --> 08:46.940
my boss plays on PS3, and he's trying to get other people to buy the PS3 version as well.

08:46.940 --> 08:51.620
I guess there is one of my coworkers in Dallas, he's buying both versions as well, so.

08:51.620 --> 08:55.420
I still want to play on 360, but I think a lot of people are going to be playing on PS3

08:55.420 --> 08:58.260
as well, so I'll just have to play both.

08:58.260 --> 09:02.780
And whatupg in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com also says, I am not here to spoil things.

09:02.780 --> 09:04.620
If people want spoilers, they can look for them.

09:04.620 --> 09:09.820
And I think that's the nice thing to do, so please, chatters, you all are very well-behaved.

09:09.820 --> 09:10.820
Please do not spoil-

09:10.820 --> 09:13.940
If you want to look up spoilers, it's on GTAForums.com.

09:13.940 --> 09:19.100
They have a whole section of their forum dedicated to granting out five spoilers, if you really

09:19.100 --> 09:24.700
want to look at it, but I urge you not to, because why would you want to spoil yourself,

09:24.700 --> 09:27.020
you know, to some of the twists and stuff in the game?

09:27.020 --> 09:28.020
It's just not worth it.

09:28.020 --> 09:29.020
Soundtracks, sure, why not?

09:29.020 --> 09:32.740
You know, you can look up what songs are going to be on there, and, you know, it has a great

09:32.740 --> 09:36.820
soundtrack like, you know, all the other Grand Theft Auto games, so.

09:36.820 --> 09:37.820
I'm fine with that.

09:37.820 --> 09:40.220
I'll look at the track list, that's not spoiling anything for me.

09:40.220 --> 09:41.220
That's not a big deal.

09:41.940 --> 09:45.620
Yeah, I'm not going to look up any of the, you know, cutscene audio stuff, I'm not going

09:45.620 --> 09:46.620
to listen to any of that.

09:46.620 --> 09:47.620
Good for you.

09:47.620 --> 09:52.700
You know, just, we're just too close to coming out to spoil myself on some of the stuff in

09:52.700 --> 09:53.700
the game.

09:53.700 --> 09:54.700
Good for you.

09:54.700 --> 09:57.220
You know, like Easter eggs and stuff, that's a whole different thing, you know, I'll look

09:57.220 --> 09:59.300
that stuff up, because it's fun, but.

09:59.300 --> 10:02.820
Alright, well I know you are very much looking forward to Grand Theft Auto 5, what's the

10:02.820 --> 10:03.820
big day again?

10:03.820 --> 10:04.820
We're about three weeks out.

10:04.820 --> 10:05.820
17th.

10:05.820 --> 10:06.820
Four weeks out.

10:06.820 --> 10:09.060
17th, but I'm hoping to get that Friday before.

10:09.060 --> 10:10.060
Using your connections.

10:10.060 --> 10:11.060
Alright.

10:11.900 --> 10:12.900
I need it.

10:12.900 --> 10:16.060
We'll get into what we've been playing this week, but I do have a few other topics I want

10:16.060 --> 10:18.300
to address here at the top of the show.

10:18.300 --> 10:24.040
First off, I do want to say a big hello and hi to the regular listeners that we have every

10:24.040 --> 10:25.040
week for one.

10:25.040 --> 10:28.780
We have a great crowd of folks that turn up here live every week, and you know, I mentioned

10:28.780 --> 10:32.200
some of the chatters earlier, and those of you guys that turn out here Sunday night,

10:32.200 --> 10:37.160
and I know a lot of you guys listen to us throughout the week, be it on the iTunes podcast

10:37.160 --> 10:43.640
app, Stitcher Radio, TuneIn app, or whatever app you happen to be using, a big thank you

10:43.640 --> 10:45.160
for listening to us there.

10:45.160 --> 10:49.460
But I also want to say hello to anyone we might have met at Dragon Con, because I just

10:49.460 --> 10:52.440
realized this is the show that will be on the feed, because we're not going to be here

10:52.440 --> 10:55.800
live next week, because I'm going to be in Atlanta at Dragon Con, and several people

10:55.800 --> 11:00.000
will be at PAX, Dragon Con, there's other, like here in Sacramento, they're having a

11:00.000 --> 11:01.000
big anime convention.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
SchoolCon.

11:02.000 --> 11:06.000
Yeah, a lot of people get ready for school, so there's just so much going on this weekend.

11:06.000 --> 11:11.600
We will not be here Sunday night, so this will be the show that anybody I meet at Dragon

11:11.600 --> 11:14.840
Con hears, to kind of listen to the show.

11:14.840 --> 11:19.540
So a big hello to anybody I might have networked with at Dragon Con.

11:19.540 --> 11:24.420
If you are listening before Labor Day weekend, and you are going to Dragon Con, please come

11:24.420 --> 11:25.620
say hello.

11:25.620 --> 11:26.880
We're all super approachable.

11:26.880 --> 11:28.800
We would love to meet listeners.

11:28.800 --> 11:33.520
I've met a variety of listeners at PAX East, and E3, and PAX Prime, and whatever other

11:33.520 --> 11:38.920
conventions I've been at, ASEN, so forth, so I would love to meet more at Dragon Con.

11:38.920 --> 11:41.240
You get three opportunities now.

11:41.240 --> 11:46.480
The folks at Dragon Con have been wonderful in just kind of helping us get involved.

11:46.480 --> 11:53.400
So Saturday night, 5.30, at the Hilton, 2.03, the VOG Super Show, where several of us from

11:53.400 --> 11:57.360
VOG are going to get together to talk about the story about VOG Network, and talk about

11:57.360 --> 12:02.100
what it's like to have been podcasting for so long, and where we see our future is going,

12:02.100 --> 12:05.260
and maybe we have a surprise announcement in store.

12:05.260 --> 12:08.420
We'll be recording that, because that would be kind of cool to record that.

12:08.420 --> 12:13.100
We will be recording that, and Bobby will be putting it on his feed later on, so that

12:13.100 --> 12:14.100
will be awesome.

12:14.100 --> 12:17.100
Yes, Bobby Black Wolf says hello to people in the future.

12:17.100 --> 12:21.140
That is literally what I'm doing right now, saying hello to the future people, the tomorrow

12:21.140 --> 12:22.140
people.

12:22.140 --> 12:26.260
Of course, you know, I'd have to give you my little contribution on the whole thing,

12:26.260 --> 12:31.340
and that would be sitting in the middle of my classroom, in my portfolio class, using

12:31.340 --> 12:36.240
that time to work on logo, and my teacher being perfectly fine with it, because it was

12:36.240 --> 12:38.660
all stuff that was going to go in my portfolio.

12:38.660 --> 12:42.020
You know what I'll do for you, Dark Sakura, is at the panel to kind of make it like you

12:42.020 --> 12:43.020
were there.

12:43.020 --> 12:48.020
Just every 30 seconds or so, I'll just go, ah-ha, ah-ha, ah-ha, ah-ha, ah-ha, ah-ha,

12:48.020 --> 12:49.020
ah-ha.

12:49.020 --> 12:50.020
No.

12:50.020 --> 12:51.020
I'm just kidding.

12:51.020 --> 12:52.020
Don't sound like that.

12:52.020 --> 12:53.020
I'm just being a jerk.

12:53.020 --> 12:54.020
All right.

12:54.020 --> 12:55.020
No.

12:55.020 --> 12:56.020
You're being a bitch.

12:56.020 --> 12:58.960
In all seriousness, giving Jamie a hard time.

12:58.960 --> 13:03.200
In all seriousness, though, on Sunday, we're going to be a part of the Parsec Awards.

13:03.200 --> 13:06.740
We have been honored to be asked to be a part of that.

13:06.740 --> 13:10.740
So it's going to be like, I don't know, it's going to be like I'm on stage at the Oscars

13:10.740 --> 13:12.960
giving an award, although it's on a much different scale.

13:12.960 --> 13:13.960
Wear a swan dress.

13:13.960 --> 13:14.960
That's what you should do.

13:14.960 --> 13:15.960
If I had more time.

13:15.960 --> 13:18.880
You need to wear a swan dress with an egg.

13:18.880 --> 13:19.880
I would.

13:19.880 --> 13:20.880
You know what?

13:20.880 --> 13:22.560
I would sit on Travis's lap and lay an egg.

13:22.560 --> 13:23.560
No.

13:23.560 --> 13:24.560
You know what we need to do?

13:24.560 --> 13:25.560
What?

13:25.560 --> 13:31.200
We need to do like an airbrush place that does t-shirts and have them make you a swan.

13:31.200 --> 13:32.200
Okay.

13:32.200 --> 13:33.200
You've got 48 hours.

13:33.200 --> 13:34.200
You know what?

13:34.200 --> 13:36.560
I've had one done in an hour, so you can get a swan.

13:36.560 --> 13:37.560
I'll draw you a swan.

13:37.560 --> 13:38.560
That would be awesome.

13:38.560 --> 13:39.560
A swan dress t-shirt.

13:39.560 --> 13:41.560
That could be pretty sweet.

13:41.560 --> 13:42.560
Pretty sweet.

13:42.560 --> 13:43.560
All right.

13:43.560 --> 13:44.560
But anyway.

13:44.560 --> 13:45.560
You can meet Bjork.

13:45.560 --> 13:46.560
So that will be that.

13:46.560 --> 13:47.560
We are presenting one of the awards towards the end of the ceremony.

13:47.560 --> 13:53.360
And then on Monday, there's a panel about live streaming and about doing live streams

13:53.360 --> 13:54.360
and so forth.

13:54.360 --> 13:55.360
Bobby's on the panel.

13:55.360 --> 13:58.960
He's just going to support and as somebody who does a lot of live streaming himself through

13:58.960 --> 14:02.620
this show, through game streaming and so forth.

14:02.620 --> 14:03.700
And that'll be a good time.

14:03.700 --> 14:08.080
That's Monday at 11, 1130 in the morning.

14:08.080 --> 14:09.080
Just look for the streaming.

14:09.080 --> 14:10.080
At something in the morning.

14:10.080 --> 14:11.080
At something in the morning.

14:11.080 --> 14:12.280
And let's just put it this way.

14:12.280 --> 14:16.880
It'll be a miracle that I'm awake because I'll probably still be on the West Coast clock

14:16.880 --> 14:20.680
and on convention sleep, it'll be a miracle that I'm awake.

14:20.680 --> 14:21.680
Oh, boo hoo.

14:21.680 --> 14:22.680
I know, right?

14:22.680 --> 14:23.680
Eight o'clock in the morning.

14:23.680 --> 14:24.680
On convention.

14:24.840 --> 14:25.840
That's so early.

14:25.840 --> 14:27.520
On convention time though.

14:27.520 --> 14:32.560
Oh my gosh, I, I've already been told about all the drinks I'm going to be made to consume.

14:32.560 --> 14:34.440
Let's hope I don't end up in the hospital for heaven's sake.

14:34.440 --> 14:38.480
If I could make it to a morning where I actually woke up as late as eight o'clock, that would

14:38.480 --> 14:39.480
be a miracle.

14:39.480 --> 14:40.480
Okay.

14:40.480 --> 14:41.480
Like I'm kind of dry.

14:41.480 --> 14:44.880
I know I might sound peppy today because you know, there's a lot of things to be excited

14:44.880 --> 14:45.880
about.

14:45.880 --> 14:49.680
But last night, thanks to traffic, we went to San Francisco last night and didn't get

14:49.680 --> 14:53.520
back home because of traffic until three in the morning.

14:54.520 --> 15:00.680
No, there was construction on highway 80 where they were reducing it down to one lane.

15:00.680 --> 15:04.520
Every asshole has to speed up as far as they can to the last minute to merge in.

15:04.520 --> 15:07.040
Well, they were also putting up warnings that the Bay Bridge was going to be closed during

15:07.040 --> 15:08.040
the next week.

15:08.040 --> 15:09.040
That's not even, that's not even it though.

15:09.040 --> 15:10.040
So what is it?

15:10.040 --> 15:15.180
Is this like, like national or I don't know, like California state, you know, repave your

15:15.180 --> 15:20.040
street month or something because everybody is repaving the goddamn street.

15:20.040 --> 15:21.040
Everybody.

15:21.040 --> 15:25.040
Everybody is doing it all like the last couple of weeks.

15:25.040 --> 15:26.040
Hmm.

15:26.040 --> 15:27.040
Yeah.

15:27.040 --> 15:28.040
There's, there's a lot of construction.

15:28.040 --> 15:29.640
So anyway, listeners don't care about that.

15:29.640 --> 15:30.880
Uh, but dragon con.

15:30.880 --> 15:31.880
Yes.

15:31.880 --> 15:34.840
So things going on Saturday, Sunday, Monday, if you want to follow me on Twitter, I'll

15:34.840 --> 15:39.520
post updates about where I'm at provided my phone has a charge twitter.com slash sky S

15:39.520 --> 15:40.520
K I E.

15:40.520 --> 15:41.520
That's my personal Twitter.

15:41.520 --> 15:46.600
Uh, so you can follow me there and get your dragon con updates, uh, dark soccer, Loki,

15:46.600 --> 15:50.040
sadly not coming with me to dragon con, but I know we'll be following the news from packs

15:50.040 --> 15:51.040
at home.

15:51.040 --> 15:52.040
And I'm going to school con.

15:52.040 --> 15:53.040
Are you?

15:53.040 --> 15:54.040
Well, that's good.

15:54.040 --> 15:56.160
I'm actually dropping the class and taking another class.

15:56.160 --> 15:58.440
I'm surprised you're not going to go to sack anime at least for a day.

15:58.440 --> 15:59.440
Just check it out.

15:59.440 --> 16:00.440
Rob.

16:00.440 --> 16:01.440
Sack anime costs money.

16:01.440 --> 16:02.440
Guess who doesn't have a job.

16:02.440 --> 16:03.440
That's true.

16:03.440 --> 16:04.720
You can't, can't pull media strings.

16:04.720 --> 16:08.040
It was actually, I tried, it's too, too late.

16:08.040 --> 16:10.760
Don't I'm trying to get us in for a panel next con.

16:10.760 --> 16:11.760
Yes.

16:11.760 --> 16:12.760
Yes, please.

16:12.760 --> 16:13.760
I would totally Skype in.

16:13.760 --> 16:14.760
I begged.

16:14.760 --> 16:17.960
I know how con con wifi con wifi is a pain in the ass.

16:17.960 --> 16:20.520
We'd love to have you, but that's why we're not live streaming.

16:20.520 --> 16:23.320
If you want to know why we aren't live streaming the panel, especially when we have big news

16:23.320 --> 16:27.600
to talk about, uh, that's why, because you cannot depend on hotel wifi, even though I'm

16:27.600 --> 16:31.080
sure they bring in the Uber stuff for dragon con, which is a huge deal.

16:31.080 --> 16:32.080
So anyway, yes.

16:32.080 --> 16:33.080
Dragon con.

16:33.080 --> 16:34.840
The other thing I want to talk about at the top of the show before we get into our gaming

16:34.840 --> 16:39.120
weeks, I guess this is a little bit about our gaming weeks, but, um, I, I don't know

16:39.120 --> 16:42.840
if dark soccer has been playing this this weekend, but, uh, the early launch for final

16:42.840 --> 16:46.000
fantasy 14 started on Friday.

16:46.040 --> 16:49.640
And, uh, I know we talked about this game at length last week, so I don't want to draw

16:49.640 --> 16:55.240
this out too much, but lot of problems going on with final fantasy 14 launch, which is

16:55.240 --> 16:59.400
really unfortunate, but, uh, they're having some severe network issues.

16:59.400 --> 17:03.320
Once you get in the game, it's a fairly pleasant experience, except for the fact that the first

17:03.320 --> 17:08.640
day instances weren't working, which usually most MMOs isn't a big deal, except in final

17:08.640 --> 17:13.680
fantasy 14, you have story instances you have to do about every five levels and you go into

17:13.680 --> 17:18.480
solo instances and beat them, which is fun and it, you know, it, it helps you learn about

17:18.480 --> 17:19.480
your character and so forth.

17:19.480 --> 17:22.880
But when the instance finders down, that really sucks because you can't progress your character

17:22.880 --> 17:26.560
past like level 10 unless you had a character who was already higher levels.

17:26.560 --> 17:30.160
So, and don't forget about the fates lasting like four times as long as normal.

17:30.160 --> 17:31.160
Yeah.

17:31.160 --> 17:33.320
So it's just, it's just a lot of experience.

17:33.320 --> 17:34.440
So that was day one.

17:34.440 --> 17:38.640
Well today they fixed it, but they did it by severely limiting how many people could

17:38.640 --> 17:39.860
log into the game.

17:39.860 --> 17:43.820
So so many people like you'll get, you'll get to the log on screen, you hit the button

17:43.820 --> 17:47.980
and this, uh, server full, can't get in, server full, can't get in, server full, like over

17:47.980 --> 17:48.980
and over and over again.

17:48.980 --> 17:50.460
I've seen people complaining about this on Twitter.

17:50.460 --> 17:54.340
I sat there for 15 minutes, hammering the button and I finally got in and I played for

17:54.340 --> 17:58.440
like four hours cause I'm like, once I'm in, I'm not leaving.

17:58.440 --> 18:03.180
But the reason why I bring this up, it's not like every MMO doesn't have their share of

18:03.180 --> 18:04.180
problems.

18:04.180 --> 18:06.460
I'm not defending final fantasy 14 in this regard.

18:06.460 --> 18:08.460
I will say it's a great game.

18:08.460 --> 18:12.340
Once you get in there and get past all this bullshit, I'm having a great time.

18:12.340 --> 18:19.040
However, it really sucks that these network issues are taking away that attention from

18:19.040 --> 18:24.060
what is otherwise a great game and it really sucks that Square Enix wasn't a little better

18:24.060 --> 18:29.460
prepared for it, which every MMO has the same damn story.

18:29.460 --> 18:33.660
Every MMO has the same exact story when it comes to launching and servers being offline

18:33.660 --> 18:34.660
stuff.

18:34.660 --> 18:39.860
Why did Microsoft think that they're going to be different with their whole online tie

18:39.860 --> 18:42.380
to, you know, consoles and stuff?

18:42.380 --> 18:45.700
Oh no, no, everybody's going to screw that up, but we won't.

18:45.700 --> 18:46.700
We won't screw it up.

18:46.700 --> 18:47.700
Microsoft?

18:47.700 --> 18:52.780
Well, yeah, cause he's saying with the Xbox one, you know, and we were saying at the time

18:52.780 --> 18:55.980
we said, look at what happened to Diablo three, look at what happened to SimCity.

18:55.980 --> 18:59.140
Well just add Final Fantasy 14 to that list.

18:59.140 --> 19:04.140
SimCity, perfect example of like, well, we saw what happened with Diablo three and we're

19:04.140 --> 19:06.600
taking precautions to make sure that it doesn't happen.

19:06.600 --> 19:09.980
And it's like, you just cursed yourself, you stupid idiot.

19:09.980 --> 19:13.380
No matter who you are, these situations are going to keep happening.

19:13.380 --> 19:19.140
I mean the first Final Fantasy 14 version 1.0 was such a stinker that they probably

19:19.140 --> 19:23.180
were legitimately not expecting this many people from North America to give it a second

19:23.180 --> 19:24.180
chance.

19:24.180 --> 19:28.020
I think it's amazing and speaks to the quality of the game that people are giving it a second

19:28.020 --> 19:29.500
chance.

19:29.500 --> 19:34.940
But uh, some people like, um, do you guys know who Chris Cluey is?

19:34.940 --> 19:35.940
He's that guy.

19:35.940 --> 19:39.100
He used to be a punter for the Vikings and now I think he's with the Raiders.

19:39.100 --> 19:40.100
That's sports ball.

19:40.100 --> 19:43.420
Well, but he's a very big advocate for gay rights in the NFL.

19:43.420 --> 19:46.460
He's not gay himself, but he's a huge advocate for gay rights is when I've gone on Ellen

19:46.460 --> 19:49.060
and all this and he's a Warcraft player.

19:49.060 --> 19:53.660
So he's, you know, he's a great guy and you know, is, is also a nerd as well as doing

19:53.660 --> 19:55.860
sports ball for a living and sticks up for all this stuff.

19:55.900 --> 20:00.100
Well, he was writing these tweets this weekend, very angry and he was so mad.

20:00.100 --> 20:04.340
He couldn't even redeem his code for Final Fantasy 14 that he did a charge back on buying

20:04.340 --> 20:05.340
the game.

20:05.340 --> 20:09.700
You know, it's, yeah, I know it's kind of a dick thing to do, but I get it.

20:09.700 --> 20:12.580
But there's probably a lot of people out there that are feeling kind of ripped off and it

20:12.580 --> 20:14.820
kind of, it really sucks.

20:14.820 --> 20:18.680
So what do you think gaming companies can do about these network issues?

20:18.680 --> 20:25.300
Because I understand the concern that, well, if they, let's say they put up a hundred servers.

20:25.340 --> 20:29.740
OK, great. So for 30 days, you have a hundred servers running rocking full of people and

20:29.740 --> 20:32.580
then it dies off totally completely.

20:33.100 --> 20:34.180
Well, how do we get around that?

20:34.180 --> 20:38.740
That's the thing is that's why Microsoft's pushing the whole Azure server thing.

20:38.980 --> 20:40.420
It's basically virtual servers.

20:40.420 --> 20:45.340
So they they can scale them back pretty fast or scale or virtual.

20:45.540 --> 20:49.500
Yeah, virtual servers. So basically you can scale them back pretty fast when it does die

20:49.500 --> 20:52.060
off instead of having all this hardware that they're running.

20:52.220 --> 20:53.820
You know, they're running a bunch of virtual machines.

20:53.820 --> 20:55.980
And so there's that.

20:56.420 --> 21:00.660
So maybe something like that would help, you know, and then that way.

21:01.820 --> 21:06.580
Because I mean, it's it's a hard balancing game because you can you don't want to buy too

21:06.580 --> 21:12.580
many servers or have too many of them running because you're not going to need them past

21:12.580 --> 21:14.860
launch once that kind of evens out.

21:15.140 --> 21:19.940
So you deal with, you know, spending less money up front and having people kind of be a

21:19.940 --> 21:24.100
little bit pissed about it for two weeks and then, you know, leveling off and everybody

21:24.100 --> 21:25.100
kind of forgetting about it.

21:26.660 --> 21:29.180
Or you spend a lot of money and have everybody be happy.

21:29.180 --> 21:33.940
But you're out all that extra money up to wait a lot longer before you recoup that.

21:33.940 --> 21:38.820
Yeah, yeah. The Old Republic, huge example of some of that where, you know, even even

21:38.820 --> 21:43.420
though they had a million servers, still they had the lines queuing up and still they had

21:43.420 --> 21:44.500
a big mess as well.

21:44.500 --> 21:48.620
But it calmed down after a couple of days and then interest in the game just tanked as

21:48.620 --> 21:50.020
people's 30 day period ran out.

21:50.020 --> 21:56.020
I mean, it still has had its fans and still has its fans, but not enough to necessitate all

21:56.020 --> 21:57.340
the servers that game had.

21:57.340 --> 22:00.860
And it was like a lot of servers went very ghost town, which was very sad.

22:01.060 --> 22:06.900
Yeah, I think what has to happen is that a lot of MMOs at this point really need to kind of

22:06.900 --> 22:12.820
challenge themselves on the multiple server way of thinking that a lot of MMOs do.

22:13.060 --> 22:17.460
And I see some MMOs and I think Guild Wars and I'm even thinking back to the original

22:17.460 --> 22:21.740
Guild Wars is a great example of this kind of has the and you see Warcraft moving towards

22:21.740 --> 22:25.260
this, too, with their whole servers that they're talking about, the virtual servers where we

22:25.260 --> 22:28.580
need to really like you might be on a different box.

22:28.700 --> 22:32.180
You might be playing on a different machine, but it's one world.

22:32.340 --> 22:33.500
It's one world.

22:33.500 --> 22:38.780
And you are phased to the people that you want to play with and so forth like Guild Wars

22:38.780 --> 22:42.860
did this. You go into the city and you could pick which one of the 50 different copies of

22:42.860 --> 22:43.900
the city do you want to be in.

22:43.900 --> 22:46.140
And then when you go out in the world, you're in your own little instance.

22:46.260 --> 22:50.260
And I think that was a good way to kind of challenge the traditional you're on your server and

22:50.260 --> 22:51.300
you don't leave those servers.

22:51.300 --> 22:54.380
And if you want to change servers, twenty five bucks kind of way of thinking.

22:54.820 --> 22:59.300
Well, that's just dumb anyways, because, I mean, what is copying a file across the server?

22:59.340 --> 23:00.500
Well, that's World of Warcraft.

23:00.500 --> 23:01.540
That's World of Warcraft right now.

23:01.540 --> 23:05.660
It's just like it's like charging a seventy five dollars to put a cabin air filter in.

23:05.820 --> 23:07.100
It takes like one second.

23:08.020 --> 23:11.940
I hated the cross server instance as well, which is one of the big reasons I quit.

23:12.500 --> 23:15.260
Hated it. I would rather be on one server.

23:15.700 --> 23:17.980
With the people who I know are on one server.

23:18.980 --> 23:21.980
But what if you have that one friend who's on another server?

23:21.980 --> 23:24.620
I mean, the way WoW does it, I like that.

23:24.620 --> 23:27.420
I hated when you're out in the world and it cross server.

23:28.140 --> 23:30.180
Yeah, I loathed it.

23:30.180 --> 23:32.060
Yeah, that screwed up the crafting.

23:32.060 --> 23:34.100
But anyway, I don't want to screw up everything.

23:34.260 --> 23:38.260
I don't want to get too much into the WoW talk because, you know, I already have another show

23:38.260 --> 23:40.660
for a lot of that. But I think this MMO stuff is good.

23:40.660 --> 23:45.020
If I wanted to play cross server, it was with someone I knew I could choose to play with

23:45.020 --> 23:46.540
somebody I wanted to play with.

23:46.540 --> 23:51.940
Right. They really need they just need to put out the server server program or whatever for

23:51.940 --> 23:53.820
Final Fantasy 11. Just let it go.

23:54.220 --> 23:56.900
You are dying to hack the crap out of that game.

23:56.900 --> 24:00.380
I just want to play that game because it's free to play with would have been awesome for

24:00.380 --> 24:03.300
that because it's got to go free to play or close pretty soon.

24:03.300 --> 24:04.660
I mean, we'll see.

24:05.620 --> 24:07.180
They just released an expansion.

24:07.340 --> 24:10.820
The very last PlayStation two game ever made was a Final Fantasy 11 expansion.

24:11.100 --> 24:13.820
Just they have to technically.

24:14.660 --> 24:17.020
They don't have to do shit.

24:17.020 --> 24:17.980
They have to do that.

24:18.380 --> 24:19.700
They don't have to do a damn thing.

24:20.780 --> 24:22.820
They have to die and pay taxes.

24:22.820 --> 24:25.540
That's it. Anyhow.

24:25.700 --> 24:27.940
Even then, you know, corporations get out of the tax.

24:29.940 --> 24:35.180
All right. Let's get into how is your gaming week and specifically what types of games have

24:35.180 --> 24:37.660
you been playing this week besides 14 and all that?

24:37.660 --> 24:38.740
What other games have you been playing?

24:38.740 --> 24:42.740
Dark Sakura, Fractal, Dragon Age 2, Mass Effect 3 and

24:44.180 --> 24:45.500
Yeah, and Animal Crossing.

24:45.660 --> 24:48.220
Is there something going on with a Dragon Age Renaissance?

24:48.220 --> 24:50.660
Because Alan's been really into Dragon Age this week, too.

24:50.900 --> 24:54.980
I just decided to finally finish Dragon Age 2 and I hate Anders.

24:55.740 --> 25:00.340
And Fenris was a dick, too, but he was at least pretty.

25:01.380 --> 25:04.940
And and he does get kind of better and he actually has a reason for being a dick.

25:06.220 --> 25:10.460
And yeah, I wasn't super impressed with it.

25:10.460 --> 25:13.620
It was OK. I might go back and play Origins and Awakenings.

25:13.620 --> 25:18.460
But I just wanted to finish it that and, you know, while there was server maintenance going

25:18.460 --> 25:20.100
on, I was like, OK, I'll just play something else.

25:20.420 --> 25:22.980
I really didn't care. I haven't had the energy to care.

25:23.620 --> 25:25.380
So it's like one thing goes down.

25:25.380 --> 25:27.420
Well, it's not like I don't have 50,000 other things to play.

25:27.420 --> 25:29.940
And that's that's the way a lot of people should look at it.

25:30.140 --> 25:33.580
And not to dig up the old topic we just left.

25:33.580 --> 25:39.300
But I will say, like most things in gaming, a month from now, who's going to remember all

25:39.300 --> 25:41.780
this fuckery? Very few people.

25:41.780 --> 25:45.460
Well, we'll still remember it, but we won't be angry.

25:45.460 --> 25:47.580
We'll be past it because you'll be busy playing the game.

25:47.700 --> 25:50.140
Like, remember when PlayStation three was hacked?

25:50.780 --> 25:55.860
Remember when Xbox 360 took all those people's money through the EA games?

25:56.260 --> 26:00.900
Remember all these things that happened that we just kind of remember when they knew it

26:00.900 --> 26:02.420
just red ring? Yeah.

26:03.940 --> 26:08.260
Remember when Diablo three launched and it was shit like, hey, speaking of which, Diablo

26:08.260 --> 26:11.300
three launches in the console a couple of weeks.

26:11.380 --> 26:13.420
How do you think that's going to do? I don't think it's going to do very well.

26:13.420 --> 26:14.980
I don't see you pretty popular so far.

26:15.300 --> 26:16.940
There's not a whole ton coming out in September.

26:16.940 --> 26:22.460
Remember, there's Grand Theft Auto and then FIFA and Diablo.

26:22.460 --> 26:23.900
I mean, that's pretty much it.

26:25.100 --> 26:30.020
Rayman, I guess. But I think it's probably going to be the second biggest game of the

26:30.020 --> 26:34.180
month. Jamie, was there anything else you want to say about your gaming week?

26:35.020 --> 26:37.460
Not really. Sorry, I didn't mean to deviate from it too much.

26:37.460 --> 26:38.860
But you were having a sneezy.

26:38.860 --> 26:42.340
No, I'm actually I think something might have set off my allergies worse.

26:42.860 --> 26:44.940
I hope it wasn't the kitty. I don't think it's kitty.

26:45.260 --> 26:46.340
Can't be anything in here.

26:46.940 --> 26:48.860
Was it the stuff I used to vacuum earlier?

26:48.860 --> 26:52.540
Maybe I don't know, but it's like it's now getting into my eyes.

26:52.900 --> 26:56.020
Feel better if you need to go outside for a minute or something to do it.

26:56.140 --> 26:58.140
I think going outside will make it worse, make it worse.

26:58.300 --> 27:01.820
Yeah, I didn't start to feel better at home until I turned on the AC and filtered

27:01.820 --> 27:05.980
everything. I'm going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

27:06.020 --> 27:09.140
Fifth Dream says, I want the Diablo three expansion a lot.

27:09.140 --> 27:10.460
You know, we'll be talking about that in a little bit.

27:10.700 --> 27:13.420
Dungeon Buster says, the trailer for that looks nice.

27:14.020 --> 27:18.100
Code Man says, never forget Final Fantasy 14, A Realm Reborn.

27:18.340 --> 27:21.660
Well, honestly, Code Man, you could probably insert any other MMO in there.

27:21.660 --> 27:23.620
Every MMO, every single one of them.

27:23.620 --> 27:25.020
Never forget Ragnarok Online.

27:25.020 --> 27:29.900
And Square Enix will probably want you to forget about Final Fantasy 14, take one.

27:30.220 --> 27:34.940
Exactly. The smoothest MMO launch I probably played was probably

27:35.860 --> 27:38.220
actually Guild Wars 2. I will give them credit.

27:38.380 --> 27:42.220
That was a pretty smooth launch, but it still had its share of problems.

27:42.380 --> 27:45.300
Defiance wasn't so bad, but that's also because no one was playing it.

27:47.260 --> 27:48.940
All right, Loki, how was your gaming week?

27:49.740 --> 27:51.780
I only played Saints Row 4 this week.

27:52.580 --> 27:56.540
I actually started off playing the Xbox 360 version, but then once my Steam

27:57.100 --> 28:00.300
version unlocked, I just went ahead and finished up and played on that.

28:00.300 --> 28:03.380
And I'm pretty much I'm almost 100 percent complete.

28:04.380 --> 28:07.740
I have just one mission left, so I've been finishing up all the activities

28:08.020 --> 28:10.180
and I'm almost golden everything.

28:10.180 --> 28:14.060
I have all the collectibles collected and I have

28:15.100 --> 28:16.540
almost all the activities done.

28:16.540 --> 28:19.140
I have a few more that have the gold that had silver on,

28:19.140 --> 28:21.500
but I'll probably be done with it today.

28:23.140 --> 28:25.220
Which brings me to

28:25.220 --> 28:29.340
more about the game and kind of a little pseudo reveal review, if you will.

28:29.340 --> 28:34.140
Well, I keep hearing people refer to Saints Row 4 as

28:35.020 --> 28:37.980
the love letter written to Saints Row fans.

28:38.820 --> 28:42.140
But the problem is, though, this game,

28:42.500 --> 28:45.740
the only thing that seems to be coming out of it is like all these cool

28:46.060 --> 28:50.180
like in the very beginning, the missions kind of were lame and it kind of sucked.

28:50.540 --> 28:54.980
And then as you get to the point where you're finding more of your crew members

28:54.980 --> 28:57.580
on, you know, you're taking them out of the simulation

28:57.580 --> 29:00.860
and you're starting to do the loyalty missions and stuff,

29:00.860 --> 29:02.780
it's where they start actually getting pretty creative

29:02.780 --> 29:04.300
with the actual missions and stuff.

29:04.300 --> 29:06.140
And there's some pretty funny stuff in there.

29:06.140 --> 29:11.940
There is one with Asha where it's a whole rip on Metal Gear Solid.

29:12.220 --> 29:14.580
And so there's, you know, the

29:15.660 --> 29:18.820
the whole point in there is like, OK, in this section,

29:18.900 --> 29:21.100
we're going to need to shoot at the lights

29:21.100 --> 29:23.580
and then we're going to have to take out the guard. OK.

29:24.060 --> 29:26.340
All right. Now this is going to be completely different.

29:26.580 --> 29:29.900
What I'm going to need you to do is I need you to shoot at the lights

29:29.900 --> 29:32.700
and take it. It's kind of funny. I like that.

29:33.140 --> 29:35.340
And then some of the there is a mission with

29:36.580 --> 29:40.540
Pierce, where they do like a duet with

29:42.140 --> 29:47.540
the song. Opposites attract or whatever.

29:47.900 --> 29:50.140
Oh, the Paul Abdul song. Yes, Paul Abdul.

29:50.140 --> 29:53.700
So they did that. And they also sing some other songs on the radio.

29:54.060 --> 29:56.300
But it's like that part right there kind of makes me smile

29:56.300 --> 30:00.660
because that's the part where they're kind of getting down to like

30:00.660 --> 30:03.460
what made the games good is like the personality in the game.

30:03.700 --> 30:08.220
But a lot of the throughout the whole missions and stuff that this love letter

30:08.220 --> 30:12.220
to the fans is basically like, hey, remember how cool Saints Row 2 was?

30:13.020 --> 30:16.060
And that's it. It's like, hey, remember how cool Saints Row 2 was?

30:16.180 --> 30:17.340
Hey, remember this guy?

30:17.340 --> 30:21.180
Remember how you really did like this really fucked up thing to like get him back?

30:21.340 --> 30:23.780
Remember how crazy shit was back in that?

30:25.100 --> 30:28.580
That's it. It's if you wanted to write a love letter to the fans,

30:28.580 --> 30:33.900
you would make a game that outperformed Saints Row 2 in every single way,

30:33.900 --> 30:38.580
because Saints Row 2 hit that wonderful balance of crazy and grounded,

30:38.740 --> 30:41.260
where, yes, you didn't have superpowers and stuff,

30:41.260 --> 30:44.260
but there was a very compelling storyline to it.

30:44.460 --> 30:47.700
And it was crazy and quirky enough that where it was enjoyable.

30:47.860 --> 30:52.420
Then three went full retard and just, you know, how do you go from there?

30:52.620 --> 30:56.060
Their idea was, hey, let's make it even crazier.

30:56.260 --> 30:59.260
We'll put in a virtual simulation and we'll give you superpowers.

30:59.260 --> 31:01.460
Well, that's kind of cool at first.

31:01.780 --> 31:04.860
But then you realize that all these cool weapons that they developed,

31:04.980 --> 31:07.380
you know, that you can use in the game are kind of useless

31:07.380 --> 31:09.780
and they end up using the same weapons over and over.

31:10.700 --> 31:13.100
Or they're just reskins of weapons that were in other games.

31:13.100 --> 31:16.780
And also, what's up with, you know, them saying, hey,

31:16.860 --> 31:19.540
we're not going to have these missions where we're basically going to have you

31:19.540 --> 31:21.580
do the activities and kind of force you to do that.

31:21.700 --> 31:23.060
No, actually, all that's in there.

31:23.060 --> 31:26.300
In fact, the last bits of the loyalty missions that you have to do

31:26.300 --> 31:29.660
for your crew members are all the fucking activities in the game.

31:29.740 --> 31:30.580
That's all it is.

31:30.580 --> 31:32.620
They didn't even bother to think of new missions.

31:32.780 --> 31:35.660
They just like, hey, do this fucking activity because we developed it.

31:35.660 --> 31:38.860
And the fact that they're basing a lot of these activities off of,

31:38.860 --> 31:41.860
was it cyber blazing, which was in Saints Row the third,

31:42.580 --> 31:45.940
which I think was the worst activity in the whole fucking game.

31:46.100 --> 31:48.460
And now they have a whole bunch based off of that.

31:48.460 --> 31:50.300
It's just kind of annoying.

31:50.300 --> 31:51.820
But the game is still good.

31:51.820 --> 31:54.500
It's just it's sad because

31:54.500 --> 31:58.420
they remind you about how great the series was.

31:58.420 --> 32:01.860
And there are some moments that are still great, but it's kind of

32:02.860 --> 32:04.780
it's kind of like just going through the paces again.

32:04.780 --> 32:07.140
They're not really.

32:08.460 --> 32:12.420
They're not trying too hard, it seems like, because it's the same world.

32:12.540 --> 32:13.940
It's based off the same engine.

32:13.940 --> 32:16.660
Yeah, they tweaked some stuff, but the superpowers are fucking from the

32:17.500 --> 32:21.580
they were from the expansion for Saints Row the third, Saints Row the third.

32:21.700 --> 32:24.020
The superpowers were from troubled clones.

32:24.580 --> 32:25.820
They're exactly the same.

32:25.820 --> 32:28.020
They just kind of built upon that.

32:28.460 --> 32:29.700
That's my problem with it.

32:29.700 --> 32:33.140
It's just I don't see I mean, there's going to be replayability

32:33.140 --> 32:36.180
because I know the PC version and the modding community

32:36.180 --> 32:37.580
is going to be great on it and stuff.

32:37.580 --> 32:39.940
And it's it's just been out for a little bit.

32:39.940 --> 32:42.620
And they already have some pretty cool stuff available already. But

32:44.140 --> 32:47.420
story wise, I hope the last mission is really good.

32:47.460 --> 32:49.020
That's what I'm hoping.

32:49.020 --> 32:51.620
But I just think it's going to be kind of a letdown.

32:51.700 --> 32:53.660
Thank God they brought Gat back, because that

32:54.580 --> 32:57.100
it's very clear when you once you rescue him

32:57.100 --> 32:59.780
and you actually playing with him and some of the other missions.

32:59.860 --> 33:01.860
It's like, why the hell did they kill that guy off?

33:01.860 --> 33:04.300
And the way they explained how he came back is brilliant.

33:04.300 --> 33:07.100
I like that. But it was just

33:08.380 --> 33:11.940
once again, it's like, OK, he was a great part of Saints Row two.

33:12.860 --> 33:17.020
And. You know, that's kind of why you need him back in the game, because

33:18.540 --> 33:21.740
it's going to be hard to figure out where they go for the fifth game from here.

33:21.740 --> 33:22.860
They're going to have to scale it back,

33:22.860 --> 33:24.980
and I hope that they find a happy medium with number two.

33:24.980 --> 33:28.100
When I'm listening to you kind of talk about your disappointment with it,

33:28.100 --> 33:31.940
I almost feel like you're saying that you kind of feel like it's still,

33:31.980 --> 33:34.660
you know, a lot of people were razzing the whole fact that it's

33:34.660 --> 33:38.740
it was an expansion turned into a full game and that, oh, my gosh,

33:38.740 --> 33:39.940
it's not really going to be a full game.

33:39.980 --> 33:44.420
Most people I've heard talk about it say that was really unfounded

33:44.620 --> 33:47.220
because they really did all this different stuff with the game.

33:47.220 --> 33:48.500
And you do get that full game experience.

33:48.500 --> 33:52.660
But the way you talk about it, you make it sound like it is more of an expansion.

33:52.700 --> 33:57.100
It does seem like I mean, there's a lot of there's content in there.

33:57.900 --> 33:59.940
There's missions that are pretty unique.

33:59.940 --> 34:03.660
And, you know, I'll give them that because and they do stand out quite

34:04.460 --> 34:06.020
well from everything else.

34:06.020 --> 34:12.220
But a lot of it is just kind of in there, just just because, like, you know.

34:15.220 --> 34:18.900
A lot of the stuff that they explain in the game is because of the you have

34:18.900 --> 34:22.860
that you were hacking the simulation, but like the the mini games in there

34:22.860 --> 34:26.900
and the activities that they have you do kind of don't make any sense.

34:27.540 --> 34:30.060
I mean, and yeah, I understand it's not supposed to make a ton of sense,

34:30.060 --> 34:34.300
but it really doesn't make any sense why it's in there other than it's a thing to do.

34:34.620 --> 34:39.380
You know, like, why do I have to go in the simulation and throw balls at targets?

34:39.420 --> 34:43.740
You know, or why do why do I have to why do I have to run along this path

34:43.740 --> 34:45.660
and collect glowing orbs and stuff?

34:45.660 --> 34:47.180
You know, why do I have to?

34:47.180 --> 34:49.020
Why not? It worked in Crackdown.

34:49.020 --> 34:54.580
Exactly. And that's the problem, too, is they took so much inspiration,

34:54.580 --> 34:55.700
if you will, from Crackdown.

34:55.700 --> 34:57.580
It's fucking Crackdown.

34:57.580 --> 34:58.940
It's got the super powers.

34:58.940 --> 35:00.340
What's the problem with that?

35:00.340 --> 35:02.020
Everybody wants another Crackdown.

35:02.020 --> 35:03.460
It got pretty boring after all.

35:03.460 --> 35:06.060
Crackdown didn't really have a single player narrative to it.

35:06.060 --> 35:09.620
There wasn't. It was basically like a go here, kill guy, go here, kill guy.

35:09.740 --> 35:12.100
And that's fine, you know, and they have some of that.

35:12.100 --> 35:15.140
But like some of the stuff that they took from three to try to bring it over,

35:15.340 --> 35:16.740
like they just shoehorned it in there.

35:16.740 --> 35:18.180
Like you have to steal.

35:18.180 --> 35:23.020
You have the auto theft stuff where you have to go jack a car and bring it back.

35:23.340 --> 35:27.020
You know, there's the chop shop stuff, but it's because it has a virus on it

35:27.020 --> 35:30.700
or you have to kill this guy because he's a virus or it's like, come on.

35:30.820 --> 35:31.620
It's ridiculous.

35:31.860 --> 35:35.660
So to bring this back a little bit and try to try to wrap up this conversation,

35:36.460 --> 35:39.300
the only thing that strikes me as funny is that even though you're kind of giving

35:39.300 --> 35:40.740
I know you're a huge fan of Saints Row,

35:40.740 --> 35:42.340
and even though you're kind of giving me the impression

35:42.340 --> 35:47.220
you're giving this a negative review here, you've played to 93 percent completion.

35:47.220 --> 35:50.060
So there must be something you really like about this.

35:50.060 --> 35:53.300
I like the game and I want to get it done with so I can play Grand Theft Auto five.

35:53.300 --> 35:55.980
And so I got to finish it before Grand Theft Auto five comes out.

35:55.980 --> 35:57.020
Get this out of here.

35:57.020 --> 36:01.060
It's sad. I like the game, but it's just

36:01.460 --> 36:03.500
it feels very rushed.

36:03.500 --> 36:08.180
And I know that, you know, the team that evolutions great and they worked on stuff.

36:08.180 --> 36:13.460
But I feel that they've done so much better work in the past that come on.

36:13.740 --> 36:17.580
There should be no excuse for this kind of stuff. And, you know,

36:19.700 --> 36:20.420
I just don't know.

36:20.420 --> 36:24.580
It's just it's very like I understand what they were trying to do with it,

36:24.580 --> 36:28.220
but it's just doesn't like maybe it's at the point now where they're like, well,

36:28.420 --> 36:31.660
crap, we've got to go crazier for the fourth game.

36:32.380 --> 36:34.740
How do we do that? Oh, we're going to do superpowers.

36:34.740 --> 36:37.860
OK, now. And then it's like, OK, well, we got to think of a new weapon.

36:37.860 --> 36:41.220
It's got to be really crazy because people are expecting crazy.

36:41.740 --> 36:44.780
And that's the problem is I think they've gotten stuck in that now where

36:44.940 --> 36:48.700
everything has to be so over the top and like, oh, it's a cliche of this.

36:48.700 --> 36:50.620
Oh, it's a play on that.

36:50.620 --> 36:53.620
Just I think what they need to do is it's going to be interesting

36:53.620 --> 36:55.900
when they have that expansion, the first expansion come out,

36:55.900 --> 36:58.700
because they did something similar with Skyrim.

36:58.700 --> 37:01.900
The Skyrim team did where it's like, OK, here's a week develop something

37:01.900 --> 37:04.940
that you want to do and we'll put it in the game later on,

37:04.940 --> 37:06.380
or we'll try to figure out a way for it.

37:06.380 --> 37:09.380
And that's where a lot of the great content from Skyrim came from

37:09.380 --> 37:13.060
was that that kind of like almost like internal game jam type thing. Yeah.

37:13.100 --> 37:15.540
And I really wish that that's what they would do for the fifth game

37:15.540 --> 37:18.660
where just put some good ideas together would have been really cool

37:19.260 --> 37:21.420
for number four, because it is a simulation.

37:21.860 --> 37:25.380
Take chunks from Saints like Stillwater and Steelport

37:25.380 --> 37:27.140
and just mash it all together.

37:27.140 --> 37:30.380
Just like take shit from, you know, that old map and the, you know,

37:30.380 --> 37:33.540
Steelport map that would have at least made it different and interesting

37:33.740 --> 37:36.420
as opposed to just, OK, we're just going to dump the same app in there

37:36.420 --> 37:38.980
and throw some alien shit in the air and call it a day.

37:39.420 --> 37:42.500
All right. Going to our chat room with some comments live.vognetwork.com

37:42.540 --> 37:46.300
Shadownextgen says the homages in Saints Row four are amazing.

37:47.340 --> 37:51.220
Fifth Dream says Saints Row four needs tiny Tina's assault on Dragon Keep

37:51.220 --> 37:52.980
merged with Blood Dragon.

37:52.980 --> 37:54.220
That'll be some epic DLC.

37:54.220 --> 37:57.100
And Act Def says Loki should write a response review on VOG

37:57.100 --> 37:58.220
if he hasn't already.

37:58.220 --> 38:00.900
Bobby Bobby said his piece on vognetwork.com.

38:01.260 --> 38:03.580
So I still have to finish the game, so I can't write a review yet.

38:03.620 --> 38:06.340
I haven't finished. I haven't done the last mission yet. Fair enough.

38:06.340 --> 38:10.020
I'm hoping that it just, you know, brings it all back, you know, but we'll see.

38:10.140 --> 38:13.580
All right. One other question I have to ask, and I'll give this

38:13.580 --> 38:14.900
little shout out here.

38:14.900 --> 38:18.660
I was listening to my friends over on the video game realness podcast,

38:18.660 --> 38:21.420
which is a fun show, and I think they tweeted you guys this week.

38:21.580 --> 38:23.620
But they were talking about Saints Row four.

38:23.820 --> 38:27.900
And one of the hosts was was just downright giddy

38:27.900 --> 38:30.380
that you could dress your character up as She-Ra. Is that true?

38:31.420 --> 38:34.340
I don't know if you can do She-Ra, but I know that they have the Rainbow

38:34.340 --> 38:35.220
Bright costume.

38:37.100 --> 38:38.540
That's pretty amazing as well.

38:38.540 --> 38:43.860
But they do have like the the Thundercats, you know, thing where it's like, oh,

38:43.900 --> 38:46.060
that's what I love. Oh, oh, I'm sorry.

38:46.500 --> 38:48.380
Go ahead. One other real quick gripe.

38:48.380 --> 38:50.860
And this goes back to just game design and everything.

38:51.340 --> 38:54.900
They have like three different things that are assigned to the left

38:54.900 --> 38:56.180
and right directional pad.

38:56.700 --> 39:00.100
Left and right directional pad are for selecting your,

39:00.740 --> 39:03.780
you know, abilities, your super abilities that you're using.

39:04.500 --> 39:07.780
Also for changing your radio station

39:07.780 --> 39:11.380
and also for doing a taunt or, you know, compliment.

39:12.020 --> 39:14.540
All of those have to do is like touch the button,

39:14.620 --> 39:17.220
hold the button for a little bit or hold the button for a long time.

39:17.220 --> 39:19.020
It's fucking stupid.

39:19.020 --> 39:21.820
It's because like half the time, oh, I'm trying to do a taunt.

39:21.940 --> 39:23.700
Oh, I'm sorry. I changed the radio station.

39:23.700 --> 39:25.380
Oh, no, I changed my superpower.

39:25.380 --> 39:28.140
It's like dumb. That is completely stupid.

39:28.700 --> 39:30.380
All right. But they have a lot of this.

39:30.380 --> 39:33.580
That's what I really love about Saints Row is all this over the top shit.

39:33.580 --> 39:35.220
And so I need to check it out.

39:35.220 --> 39:37.220
So they do have a lot of cool costumes in there.

39:37.220 --> 39:40.700
So it'll be interesting to see what other stuff that they add on with DLC.

39:40.700 --> 39:42.620
So far, they haven't gone crazy yet. All right.

39:43.180 --> 39:45.140
I'll quickly talk about my gaming week.

39:45.140 --> 39:47.820
I've already talked ad nauseam about Final Fantasy 14,

39:47.820 --> 39:50.260
which honestly has been the majority of my time as the game is new.

39:50.500 --> 39:54.100
But there is at least one other game I checked out this week on PlayStation

39:54.100 --> 39:56.420
three, and this was partially a listener recommendation.

39:56.420 --> 39:58.340
I want to say I don't remember who it was.

39:58.340 --> 40:00.620
I don't remember who was in chat or an email. I apologize.

40:00.620 --> 40:03.180
I just remember seeing it on the store and I was like, oh, yeah,

40:03.180 --> 40:04.740
somebody told me I should get that and play that.

40:04.740 --> 40:07.100
So I did download Tekken Revolution,

40:07.420 --> 40:12.060
which is the free to play Tekken game that was that's on the PlayStation three.

40:12.060 --> 40:14.780
Now, I don't know why I had it in my mind.

40:15.220 --> 40:17.020
That it was the Tekken card game.

40:17.020 --> 40:19.380
I don't know why I thought that, but I did.

40:19.940 --> 40:21.940
I downloaded it and it's totally not.

40:21.940 --> 40:22.940
Wasn't that the PSP game?

40:22.940 --> 40:26.100
Maybe maybe that's where I'm like crossing wires or something.

40:26.100 --> 40:28.740
But anyway, it's not it has nothing to do with cards.

40:28.940 --> 40:30.820
It's a straight up fighting game,

40:30.820 --> 40:33.780
just like it was Tekken seven or something on the consoles.

40:34.660 --> 40:38.460
But it's but it's a free to play game, which is weird.

40:38.460 --> 40:42.460
But I, I kind of I actually really enjoyed it.

40:43.020 --> 40:45.820
Come to think of it, you know, it was free.

40:46.140 --> 40:49.660
And the way that they make their money is that you can play either.

40:49.660 --> 40:52.780
I think it's like you could do five player versus player matches

40:53.020 --> 40:57.420
or two versus computer matches before you run out of energy.

40:57.660 --> 41:00.100
But the computer matches are like arcade style.

41:00.100 --> 41:02.460
So if you win, you get to play again and again and again

41:02.460 --> 41:06.020
until you get up to like a boss that you kill like seven people in.

41:06.380 --> 41:09.220
And each time you win a match, you get a little bit of cash.

41:09.220 --> 41:12.100
You get a little bit of experience, a little bit of these gift points.

41:12.420 --> 41:16.220
The gift points you end up unlocking characters later on or so I hear.

41:16.220 --> 41:18.260
I guess it takes a lot to do it because I haven't done it yet.

41:19.220 --> 41:21.380
The money you can use to up the stats

41:21.380 --> 41:25.260
on your character for when you go fight later matches.

41:25.500 --> 41:31.020
So the either now I know I'm not that good at fighting games

41:31.020 --> 41:33.660
because I was about to say either I'm really good at fighting games,

41:33.660 --> 41:35.660
but I know that's not the case.

41:35.660 --> 41:38.860
But I went in there and in my first time through, I picked Marshall Law

41:38.860 --> 41:40.820
because he's one of my favorite Tekken characters.

41:40.820 --> 41:42.300
Jamie's rolling your eyes at me.

41:42.300 --> 41:44.540
No, I was actually just about to ask who you were using.

41:44.540 --> 41:47.900
I use Marshall Law. OK, he's not very mashable.

41:47.940 --> 41:51.940
But I, I beat arcade mode

41:51.940 --> 41:55.620
my first time on normal and got like a ton of points from doing it.

41:55.780 --> 41:59.980
When I went on hard difficulty, I actually had a little bit of issue.

41:59.980 --> 42:01.100
I wasn't able to get as far.

42:01.100 --> 42:04.700
But then when I did, I actually got brave and I went and did a PvP match.

42:04.700 --> 42:05.900
Like I didn't think I was going to do it.

42:05.900 --> 42:07.380
Oh, God, I'm going to get my ass kicked.

42:07.380 --> 42:09.380
But actually, I will say this about the PvP match.

42:09.580 --> 42:13.340
I got matched up against somebody who was now they ended up beating me.

42:13.580 --> 42:17.220
But it was like a five round match because it's like two out of three.

42:17.220 --> 42:20.660
And it went the full five rounds like they were equally matched with me.

42:20.660 --> 42:23.860
And I was very impressed at that, especially for a free game.

42:24.180 --> 42:27.020
So if you like fighting games

42:27.380 --> 42:30.860
and you like Tekken, why the fuck not? It's free.

42:31.020 --> 42:32.420
Now, here's how they get your money.

42:32.420 --> 42:35.460
If you want to play more, you got to buy tokens

42:35.700 --> 42:38.420
that you can use to play more matches later on.

42:38.660 --> 42:41.740
And so, you know, so there's little ways that they nickel and dime you in that regard.

42:41.740 --> 42:45.460
But as far as like a Facebook game on the PlayStation three,

42:45.460 --> 42:49.180
but said Facebook game is like a Tekken six or something like that,

42:49.340 --> 42:51.140
even though I didn't really care for Tekken six.

42:51.140 --> 42:54.220
But, you know, I'm if Tekken six had been free,

42:54.220 --> 42:56.460
I would have downloaded it and played it still and enjoyed it.

42:56.460 --> 42:59.940
So, I mean, yeah, I got to say, I was

43:00.700 --> 43:02.980
pretty impressed by this little free to play fighter.

43:03.540 --> 43:07.620
Overall, I've been pretty impressed with the free to play offerings

43:07.620 --> 43:09.380
on PlayStation three.

43:09.380 --> 43:11.540
Jetpack Joyride is pretty good, too.

43:11.540 --> 43:13.060
There's another one I checked out.

43:13.060 --> 43:15.980
So, I mean, honestly, if you're if you're like bored

43:15.980 --> 43:19.340
and don't really have anything to play right now or, you know, you can't

43:19.340 --> 43:22.660
maybe can't afford to get a new game right now or just nothing looks appealing to you.

43:22.860 --> 43:26.340
Go look at what's free on PlayStation three, because there's some pretty decent stuff.

43:26.460 --> 43:31.260
I mean, it's not going to be like as amazing as The Last of Us

43:31.260 --> 43:34.060
or, you know, these other big triple-A titles that are out right now.

43:34.060 --> 43:36.100
But it'll entertain you for a little while.

43:36.460 --> 43:38.740
Well, even if you have PlayStation Plus, it's even better.

43:38.740 --> 43:40.580
I mean, because, yeah, well, they they announced

43:40.580 --> 43:43.460
whether during Gamescom, Assassin's Creed three is coming out later.

43:43.460 --> 43:45.500
This year is free. That's crazy.

43:45.500 --> 43:47.900
This came out last year. Yeah. Crazy.

43:48.380 --> 43:52.140
So and then, well, the Hitman game was just out last year, too. Crazy.

43:52.500 --> 43:54.580
Thanks for the third if you haven't played it yet. Yeah.

43:54.580 --> 43:58.380
So Shadow Next Gen in chat says, speaking of free to play,

43:58.380 --> 44:00.580
Plants versus Zombies two is awesome.

44:00.580 --> 44:03.740
I got to put that on my queue because I've been wanting to try that.

44:03.740 --> 44:05.420
I haven't been able to try that yet.

44:05.420 --> 44:08.580
So that's really the only new game I can think of to talk about

44:08.580 --> 44:10.940
this week is Plants versus Zombies.

44:10.940 --> 44:13.420
Excuse me. That's what the chatter can think about.

44:13.420 --> 44:15.180
That's the only new game I can think to talk about.

44:15.180 --> 44:16.780
Otherwise, this Tekken Revolution.

44:16.780 --> 44:19.100
So good times. All right.

44:19.900 --> 44:21.700
Let's move on.

44:21.700 --> 44:23.620
Housekeeping, I pretty much already talked about

44:23.620 --> 44:25.860
what I wanted to talk about as far as Dragon Con and so forth.

44:26.340 --> 44:28.340
The only other thing I'll say for housekeeping is that remember

44:28.340 --> 44:30.340
there is no live show next week.

44:30.340 --> 44:32.860
So enjoy your week off for Labor Day, whatever you're doing.

44:33.620 --> 44:35.500
It's a dead show next week.

44:35.500 --> 44:38.540
And before I forget, given that we will not have a show next week,

44:38.540 --> 44:42.380
I would like to wish my fellow individuals of the Jewish Persuasion

44:43.380 --> 44:44.540
Happy New Year.

44:44.540 --> 44:46.340
So there you go.

44:46.340 --> 44:48.340
Any Labor Day greetings to give the list?

44:48.340 --> 44:49.860
Are you going to be doing Labor Day?

44:49.860 --> 44:52.180
Well, that time of year, you know what I mean?

44:52.340 --> 44:54.740
My dad's birthday, I wish my dad a happy birthday.

44:55.300 --> 44:58.060
It's the birthday, September 2nd.

44:58.060 --> 44:59.900
You do you doing anything over the holiday?

44:59.900 --> 45:02.220
Loki, you going to barbecue or anything?

45:02.220 --> 45:05.980
So I got my dad's for dinner on Saturday, I think.

45:05.980 --> 45:07.380
There you go.

45:09.380 --> 45:10.420
That's about it.

45:10.420 --> 45:11.780
All right. How about you, Dar Sacher?

45:11.780 --> 45:14.060
I'm going to I'm going to be busy being Jewish.

45:14.820 --> 45:16.540
Nothing wrong with that.

45:16.540 --> 45:19.340
Say say hi to your synagogue friends.

45:19.460 --> 45:20.300
To the Jew crew.

45:20.300 --> 45:22.580
That's Dan. Dan calls them the Jew crew.

45:22.900 --> 45:25.540
Ideally, Grantha thought a five would have leaked out by then.

45:25.540 --> 45:29.500
But, you know, I can't make any guarantees there.

45:29.500 --> 45:31.220
So there's some fun people in the Jew crew.

45:31.220 --> 45:32.980
What are we getting some of them back on the show?

45:32.980 --> 45:36.300
I don't know, but we had a really rousing game of Cards Against Humanity.

45:36.500 --> 45:40.780
It was the first time that, except for me, that any of us had played the game.

45:41.420 --> 45:42.340
It was very fun.

45:42.980 --> 45:46.820
All right. And you're getting some New Year wishes back there in the chat room from

45:46.820 --> 45:47.700
SSJ100 Matt.

45:47.700 --> 45:48.860
Yeah, thank you.

45:49.340 --> 45:53.420
And Yom Kippur is on the 16th and I will be busy fasting all day.

45:54.340 --> 45:55.300
Is that on a Sunday?

45:56.020 --> 45:58.500
No, if it was on a Sunday, I wouldn't be here.

45:59.340 --> 46:00.420
I'll tell you in advance.

46:00.420 --> 46:03.260
No, it's like, I don't want to put up with a Jamie who hasn't eaten.

46:03.740 --> 46:05.020
It's actually all day on Saturday.

46:05.220 --> 46:06.220
I think it's on a Saturday.

46:06.340 --> 46:07.700
Okay. All right.

46:08.260 --> 46:10.980
Anyhow. So, yeah, no show next week.

46:11.980 --> 46:13.140
I'm at Dragon Con.

46:13.340 --> 46:16.860
If you're going to PAX, extra fur from Horde House will be there.

46:16.860 --> 46:17.940
So keep an eye out for him.

46:18.700 --> 46:24.820
He will be our lone VOG representative at PAX because his partner has family in

46:24.820 --> 46:28.700
Seattle. So that was the better option for him to go kind of make a trip out of that.

46:28.740 --> 46:30.020
So they're off to PAX.

46:30.420 --> 46:31.660
Whereas the rest of us are Dragon Con.

46:32.500 --> 46:34.020
All right, let's move on.

46:34.060 --> 46:35.100
Time for gaming news.

46:35.100 --> 46:37.540
And there was quite a bit of it this week with Gamescom and all that, right, Loki?

46:37.580 --> 46:39.340
Yes, lots of big announcements.

46:39.700 --> 46:43.660
Sony came through with what they said they were planning on doing, which was announcing

46:43.660 --> 46:44.620
their release plans.

46:44.620 --> 46:51.340
And so with that came the release date of November 15th for the PlayStation 4.

46:51.980 --> 46:56.860
That is, of course, in North America, November 29th in Europe.

46:57.260 --> 47:04.980
And yeah, so it's kind of nice to actually have an actual lockdown date.

47:05.420 --> 47:09.140
They did announce that they're going to be launching, I should say, they poked fun at

47:09.140 --> 47:15.500
other console manufacturers and saying that they're going to be launching in 32

47:15.500 --> 47:18.060
territories this year.

47:18.060 --> 47:24.540
So launch in Australia, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany,

47:24.540 --> 47:32.260
Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Russia,

47:32.260 --> 47:40.820
Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK, and I guess Latin America, also Argentina, Brazil,

47:40.820 --> 47:47.580
Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Mexico, Panama and Peru.

47:48.900 --> 47:52.180
And the US or North America as well, obviously.

47:53.140 --> 47:54.860
And Japan, I just can't forget.

47:55.060 --> 47:56.620
Although no date for Japan yet, right?

47:57.700 --> 48:01.740
WhatupG in chat says, Sony has a press event in September, probably to announce the

48:01.740 --> 48:03.060
Japanese PlayStation 4.

48:03.060 --> 48:04.380
Yeah, that's Tokyo Game Show.

48:04.620 --> 48:07.620
Would that mean maybe later that they get it later?

48:07.620 --> 48:11.100
I'm thinking that they're probably going to be, it's going to be around the same time.

48:11.100 --> 48:12.100
It could be later.

48:12.100 --> 48:13.700
But I think that's not usual.

48:13.700 --> 48:15.260
PlayStation 3, they got it earlier.

48:15.260 --> 48:16.980
And I want to say PlayStation 2, they did too.

48:16.980 --> 48:21.820
They could launch, you know, between that time or like, you know, it's going to be

48:21.860 --> 48:24.860
around the same time, I think, probably in November still.

48:25.980 --> 48:32.860
All righty. But I did not get to watch the Sony press conference.

48:32.860 --> 48:35.100
I don't know if you watched it, but what did you think of it?

48:35.500 --> 48:36.380
I thought it was good.

48:36.380 --> 48:39.500
It was very reminiscent of E3.

48:40.460 --> 48:45.180
It was weird in the beginning because they basically had someone on stage playing the

48:45.500 --> 48:47.660
PlayStation 4 and showing kind of the interface and stuff.

48:47.860 --> 48:50.900
Also kind of showing that, hey, we're pretty much done with this thing.

48:50.940 --> 48:52.940
Like, you know, it's ready to go.

48:53.060 --> 48:54.620
That's good, though. Yes, that's good.

48:54.620 --> 49:00.860
So, you know, definitely we're going to get into a lot more of it, but, you know, still

49:00.860 --> 49:02.460
focused on like indie stuff.

49:02.460 --> 49:07.580
They announced some new IPs, you know, talked more about release dates for different

49:07.580 --> 49:12.740
things like, you know, Gran Turismo and stuff and then showed off a lot of the things

49:12.740 --> 49:17.820
that like just kind of pulled a few punches still against Microsoft.

49:17.820 --> 49:22.060
And oh, yeah, there was a big sick burn at the end, wasn't there?

49:22.380 --> 49:26.220
There's a couple. Yeah, something about the whole like and while others have changed

49:26.220 --> 49:27.780
their message. I'm going from memory here.

49:27.780 --> 49:28.740
This is the exact quote.

49:28.740 --> 49:33.140
But while where others have changed their messages, we have stayed consistent with our

49:33.140 --> 49:36.220
like there was definitely a little shade thrown.

49:36.220 --> 49:39.780
Somebody brought the umbrella to the Sony press conference to make some shade.

49:39.780 --> 49:41.020
Yes, it was.

49:41.020 --> 49:42.260
It was interesting. Yeah.

49:43.180 --> 49:47.140
So, well, this is a fun time of year because you know who's the winner in this scenario

49:47.180 --> 49:49.540
when these two companies are fighting us, the gamers.

49:50.980 --> 49:53.700
Hopefully, Loki, you look a little skeptical at that comment.

49:55.460 --> 49:57.260
Yeah, we're the winners, I think.

49:57.420 --> 49:58.940
All right. All right.

49:58.940 --> 50:01.740
Well, let's get into some of the specifics that Loki mentioned a minute ago.

50:02.020 --> 50:06.300
Here's one about and I believe they've announced something similar to this on the

50:06.300 --> 50:07.340
Microsoft platform.

50:07.340 --> 50:11.620
So this is, you know, just kind of meeting the challenge.

50:11.860 --> 50:13.420
This is through PlayStation Network.

50:13.420 --> 50:17.020
And I think a lot of it, though, they're talking more like retailer stuff like Amazon

50:17.100 --> 50:18.500
GameStop doing something similar.

50:18.500 --> 50:19.900
Gotcha. Well, here's what we're talking about.

50:19.900 --> 50:21.780
The discount upgrade program.

50:21.780 --> 50:23.460
That's that's what we're talking about here.

50:24.020 --> 50:29.820
Apparently, there will be a program where if you buy these games on the PlayStation 3

50:29.820 --> 50:33.060
and these are select games, not necessarily everything, but select games, you will have

50:33.060 --> 50:37.660
the ability to upgrade to the PlayStation 4 version for a here's my quotey fingers,

50:37.780 --> 50:39.900
significantly discounted price.

50:40.700 --> 50:45.060
Does that mean 10 bucks off, 20 bucks off, 40 bucks off?

50:45.580 --> 50:50.340
I don't know, but I would think it's a little more in the 15, 20 range than than what

50:50.340 --> 50:51.500
some people might be thinking.

50:51.500 --> 50:56.340
But who knows? Anyhow, limited time offer and some of the games involved will be Call

50:56.340 --> 51:00.700
of Duty Ghosts, Assassin's Creed 4, Black Flag, Watch Dogs, Battlefield 4.

51:00.700 --> 51:05.380
So you'll notice there's Ubisoft and EA in there, Activision and Warner Brothers, also

51:05.380 --> 51:09.740
publishers that are partnering with Sony on this initiative, the upgrade initiative.

51:09.740 --> 51:14.380
Do not know yet if it's a worldwide initiative, but certainly for North America at

51:14.380 --> 51:17.900
least. And if Japan's getting something similar, I'm sure that will be detailed at

51:17.900 --> 51:18.820
Tokyo Game Show.

51:19.260 --> 51:26.260
Now, some other details here, even though I just said expect 20 dollar discounts, Call

51:26.260 --> 51:31.300
of Duty Ghosts has said 10 bucks, not 10 bucks off, 10 bucks.

51:32.500 --> 51:34.300
That's not bad. That's not bad at all.

51:34.300 --> 51:38.220
So you buy the PlayStation 3 version of Call of Duty Ghosts, you can get the PlayStation

51:38.220 --> 51:40.100
4 version for 10 dollars.

51:40.100 --> 51:41.220
That's a damn good deal.

51:41.220 --> 51:44.460
If they're all this good, may the skeptic in me be wrong.

51:44.540 --> 51:46.740
If they're all this good, that's that's great.

51:47.620 --> 51:51.620
But here's they say it's for a limited time.

51:52.420 --> 51:57.620
And I would think who this is going to most apply to are the people that are just like not

51:57.620 --> 51:59.220
this year for the PlayStation 4.

51:59.380 --> 52:04.300
They're going to get their PlayStation 4s in 2014, you know, when some more software

52:04.300 --> 52:07.420
comes out, when next year's holiday lineup starts coming out.

52:07.820 --> 52:10.060
That's when people want to upgrade their games.

52:10.060 --> 52:12.180
But this program is not going to be available by then, right?

52:12.340 --> 52:14.740
I don't know. I didn't really see a time frame.

52:14.740 --> 52:18.740
And I think it's more of like, let's play it and play it by ear and see what happens.

52:18.740 --> 52:24.940
And, you know, it's all going to be because why would you purchase, you know, Call of Duty

52:24.940 --> 52:29.860
Ghosts and then two weeks later, you're going to get your PlayStation 4 or whatever.

52:29.900 --> 52:33.580
And oh, and I got to buy the PlayStation 4 version as well.

52:33.580 --> 52:36.540
It's like you would think that you would just kind of wait it out a little bit.

52:36.580 --> 52:39.060
Yeah. But I mean, I understand, you know.

52:39.100 --> 52:44.420
Well, I could also see like folks that are going to have PlayStation 4s under their

52:44.420 --> 52:48.420
Christmas trees or their menorahs or whatever you celebrate in the winter season.

52:48.420 --> 52:53.500
Right. That you might end up with a PlayStation 4 there when you've bought all these

52:53.500 --> 52:55.020
PlayStation 3 games.

52:55.340 --> 52:58.580
But I'm kind of like, if you're going to buy a bunch of PlayStation 3 games.

53:00.700 --> 53:04.100
Why aren't you just getting a PlayStation 4 if you're getting all these games?

53:04.100 --> 53:09.020
I don't know. I mean, then again, you know, it's not like you just throw away $400

53:09.020 --> 53:12.940
on the system, but the well, the advantage would be is that you can get a head start

53:12.940 --> 53:17.260
on getting your stats up there for, you know, Call of Duty and, you know, Battlefield

53:17.260 --> 53:21.900
and that kind of stuff. And so you start off and then you can do your transfer of your

53:21.900 --> 53:25.020
stats over to PlayStation 4 and you kind of go from there.

53:25.500 --> 53:29.340
All right. Now, Sony wanted to be clear that these upgrade prices, such as the one that

53:29.340 --> 53:33.180
we just mentioned for Call of Duty Ghosts, they are going to be set by the publisher.

53:33.180 --> 53:34.940
It's not something Sony is going to regulate.

53:34.940 --> 53:39.900
A little bit of a clarification here from UK Managing Director Fergal Gara in an interview

53:39.900 --> 53:44.940
with Digital Spy, quote, What will happen is the PlayStation 4 digital file will be made

53:44.940 --> 53:49.740
available on the PlayStation Store, as it would be anyway, at launch, and the PS3 discs

53:49.740 --> 53:50.980
will be sold through retail.

53:51.180 --> 53:55.860
What the consumer can then do for a premium to be defined by the publisher is access the

53:55.860 --> 54:00.140
PlayStation 4 digital game and then provided they still have the PlayStation 3 disc, they

54:00.140 --> 54:04.020
will be able to play the PlayStation 4 version when they decide to buy the next gen.

54:04.180 --> 54:09.140
That's a pretty clever solution because that doesn't allow you to, like, gamefly your PS3

54:09.140 --> 54:14.660
game and then upgrade. If your PS3 disc is in the drive, you can use the PlayStation 4

54:14.660 --> 54:18.580
digital version. That's a clever little way to do it.

54:19.300 --> 54:19.800
Yeah.

54:20.980 --> 54:26.900
That's all. I don't got anything to say. It's a clever little workaround. So, I mean, it's

54:26.900 --> 54:31.940
not that much different than, let's say, the Xbox 360. You install a game to your hard

54:32.020 --> 54:35.460
drive on the 360, you still require the disc in the drive, right?

54:35.460 --> 54:35.940
Yeah.

54:35.940 --> 54:40.740
Now it's just, we're seeing that bridging between two systems, which is kind of neat,

54:40.740 --> 54:44.260
especially in light of the fact that the PlayStation 4 is not backwards compatible,

54:44.260 --> 54:45.700
which is frustrating to some people.

54:45.700 --> 54:49.700
I'm wondering if that would work different than, well, obviously, it would work different

54:49.700 --> 54:53.780
if you bought a digital version of the game, I guess. You would just, you know, you wouldn't

54:53.780 --> 54:54.420
have to do that.

54:56.180 --> 54:58.340
All right. Well, let's move on with some more news.

54:58.340 --> 55:04.500
DarkSakura, who's playing in Animal Crossing, but I don't blame her. You got OLR listeners

55:04.500 --> 55:05.700
in Normandy right now?

55:05.700 --> 55:06.100
Yeah.

55:06.100 --> 55:06.420
Yeah.

55:06.420 --> 55:08.820
We have Act Deft and Fifth Dream.

55:08.820 --> 55:10.580
Okay. No Misty hitting you with a bug net?

55:10.580 --> 55:11.140
I know.

55:11.140 --> 55:14.580
That's good. Have a look out for her.

55:14.580 --> 55:19.140
There is a little bit more information for items going to be available for the PlayStation

55:19.140 --> 55:26.100
4, and one of them is going to be Twitch. It was at GamersCon. They basically said that

55:26.100 --> 55:32.500
players will be able to broadcast over Twitch channels. So there goes the need for a capture

55:32.500 --> 55:35.700
card. You'll just be doing it online, which is pretty cool.

55:37.300 --> 55:41.700
What's also interesting to me about this is that, um, you know, they, they talked about

55:41.700 --> 55:46.260
the game streaming thing before, but it was going to be Ustream originally, which is not

55:46.260 --> 55:51.140
my favorite broadcast service, especially for video games, because they kind of insert

55:51.140 --> 55:55.220
their ads a lot and it can, you know, as the broadcaster, that can be frustrating because

55:55.220 --> 56:01.460
people lose key moments of your broadcast. Um, but Twitch is a very popular streaming

56:01.460 --> 56:07.140
solution for people. And, uh, in fact, there isn't a lot of competition out there to Twitch,

56:07.140 --> 56:10.740
which really surprises me, meaning like focused on video game. I know there's others. I've

56:10.740 --> 56:16.900
heard of one called Owned, but nothing on that same stale scale of Twitch. So I'm seeing

56:16.900 --> 56:20.500
this type of stuff kind of break through on the mainstream media too. Like I was seeing

56:20.500 --> 56:24.100
something on either CNN or Yahoo or one of those sites where they were talking about,

56:24.100 --> 56:28.900
you know, more people watch Twitch TV than some basic cable channels.

56:29.940 --> 56:36.580
True. So it's, it's very much a new, new medium or new media. And now everybody's going to get

56:36.580 --> 56:42.660
to do their own broadcast right from their PlayStation four or their Xbox one, to be fair,

56:42.660 --> 56:48.020
which is detailed a similar plan. It's cool. Yeah. I think it's cool too. The only problem

56:48.020 --> 56:53.540
is that although, although I think it's, you know, I'm a big support for everybody getting

56:53.540 --> 56:58.020
to have a voice and independent broadcast and all that, and I've supported, I almost worry that

56:58.020 --> 57:02.740
the, with so much out there, it's going to be really difficult to stand out.

57:02.740 --> 57:06.900
Yeah. I kind of wish that there was a way, I mean, I'm not, I'm not too familiar with all the

57:06.900 --> 57:11.860
export options that they have available. Like if you can export those files, like you can,

57:12.740 --> 57:16.740
cause I know they have the sharing stuff that you can do, or you can share clips online,

57:16.740 --> 57:21.300
but I wonder if you can like export a huge file or something to like YouTube or export it to

57:21.300 --> 57:26.340
your computer and edit it. If it's saving to the Twitch website, you can export Twitch videos to

57:26.340 --> 57:31.220
YouTube. I have a let's play the slender man, where I screamed very high pitch when I saw

57:31.220 --> 57:35.540
slender man that's on my YouTube, which is a Rob Roberts plays, I think in my YouTube channel.

57:35.540 --> 57:39.060
And that was an export from Twitch. I think this whole thing bodes well for Twitch itself,

57:39.060 --> 57:43.860
just given that they're also going to have the Xbox deal too. Oh yeah. This is huge for them.

57:43.860 --> 57:48.020
And remember Twitch started as well, and they still run it just in TV, that whole,

57:48.100 --> 57:52.900
which was streaming your life. And I think in some ways, just I'm, I'm going to be,

57:52.900 --> 57:56.580
I'm just going to give you guys real talk from my perspective. I think Justin TV kind of became

57:56.580 --> 58:01.300
a joke in some ways, because it kind of became a lot of cam whores and people that were like,

58:01.300 --> 58:08.100
you know, pay me $5 and I'll show you my titty or show you my junk or whatever. It's kind of what,

58:08.100 --> 58:11.620
even though you're not supposed to have adult content, that's a lot of that life casting

58:11.620 --> 58:18.260
turned into, but it's really great that those guys kind of thought ahead and, you know, kind of

58:18.900 --> 58:21.780
grabbed on this gaming thing that was going on. That was a little more,

58:22.500 --> 58:30.500
you know, a little more serious, I guess. So, all right. Anyhow, I plan to use this. It'll be,

58:30.500 --> 58:35.300
it'll be fun. Yeah, I'll definitely check it out, especially, um, since I finally got around to

58:35.300 --> 58:39.940
playing around with my video capture equipment, the new stuff, um, some of the stuff I might be

58:39.940 --> 58:47.460
capturing with the brand new Twitch feature on PlayStation 4. Minecraft is a big surprise. This

58:47.460 --> 58:55.540
was something that was kind of, it was very quick, uh, reveal. They didn't really show anything other

58:55.540 --> 59:00.900
than a logo and some people walking by in costume and not even really costume, but with a mask on,

59:00.900 --> 59:06.260
but yes, Minecraft will be coming to the PlayStation 4 at launch. And it's also coming

59:06.260 --> 59:14.100
to PlayStation 3 and the Vita. And, um, there, I gotta say, internet, seriously,

59:16.020 --> 59:22.500
people on Twitter don't harass the Xbox support people regarding, like, announcements and shit.

59:22.500 --> 59:28.100
Xbox support is for helping people with shit that's wrong on your Xbox, not saying,

59:28.100 --> 59:33.780
hey, I see Minecraft, you know, which was, you know, originally a console exclusive for

59:33.780 --> 59:38.180
Xbox 360, it's coming to PlayStation 4, how do you like them apples, you know, type of shit.

59:39.140 --> 59:45.940
Technically, if you want to get, you know, into it there, yes, Microsoft has an exclusive on

59:45.940 --> 59:52.820
Minecraft, the Xbox 360 edition and Minecraft, the Xbox One edition. Minecraft and PlayStation 4

59:52.820 --> 59:58.260
will be created by yet a different company other than 4J Studios. And so, yes, it will be

59:58.260 --> 01:00:05.140
technically exclusive to PlayStation 4, whereas a different version of Minecraft is exclusive to

01:00:05.700 --> 01:00:10.180
the Xbox platforms. There, you're done. Stop emailing those people or stop, you know,

01:00:10.900 --> 01:00:15.780
tweeting to them. And yes, they're saying that, you know, it's created by Microsoft Studios,

01:00:15.780 --> 01:00:20.660
so therefore it is exclusive to Xbox. Yes, their version of the game is exclusive to the Xbox.

01:00:20.660 --> 01:00:24.580
Yeah, Bobby Blackwolf in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com, kind of echoing the same

01:00:24.580 --> 01:00:29.940
sentiment there. Xbox or excuse me, Microsoft Xbox 360 edition is still an Xbox 360 exclusive.

01:00:29.940 --> 01:00:35.940
Yes, exactly. So I would be interested to see what differences there are in it. So,

01:00:36.580 --> 01:00:42.820
yeah, be very interesting to see that. So, yeah, so there's that. And then, of course, other

01:00:43.620 --> 01:00:51.620
wonderful console exclusives. And this is basically talking a little bit about the indie

01:00:51.620 --> 01:00:58.260
games, because they were a big focus on the presentation. And some of their exclusives

01:00:58.260 --> 01:01:06.420
they're saying are going to be Hotline Miami 2, N++, Starbound, let's see, Volume,

01:01:07.380 --> 01:01:15.220
which is done by the guy who did Thomas Was Alone, Rogue Legacy, Wasteland Kings. And everybody's

01:01:15.220 --> 01:01:21.300
gone through the rapture, which I love the the parody account. Was it? Was it the Kazari

01:01:21.300 --> 01:01:24.340
parody account who said, yeah, it's a sequel to everybody's golf, you know,

01:01:26.100 --> 01:01:32.260
well, dark. Yeah. So there's that. And then, of course, other things, the binding of Isaac Rebirth

01:01:32.260 --> 01:01:40.660
of Velocity two X and Guns of Icarus online. And I guess Velocity, I think it was Velocity,

01:01:40.660 --> 01:01:44.180
you know, it wasn't velocity. There's there's another game they announced free that was going

01:01:44.180 --> 01:01:49.860
to be available for PlayStation 4 with PlayStation Plus. So you're going to get quite a lineup of

01:01:49.860 --> 01:01:57.860
free games, especially indie titles at launch. It'll be interesting. All right. Well, this is

01:01:57.860 --> 01:02:02.580
a little awkward, but these things happen, especially in live radio. I think we're going

01:02:02.580 --> 01:02:10.420
to say goodbye to Jamie for now, right? Yeah. Basically, the allergy thing is getting to the

01:02:10.420 --> 01:02:13.700
point where I'm now lightheaded. OK, but you are safe to drive because I don't want you leaving

01:02:13.700 --> 01:02:17.860
here if you can't drive. Yeah, if I if you can go lie down in the other room if you need to

01:02:17.860 --> 01:02:26.180
during the show, if if I do it now, I'll be OK. But I know how you ever have allergies to put

01:02:26.180 --> 01:02:31.780
where your face hurts. I'm going to be honest. I don't really get allergies. I mean, certain

01:02:31.780 --> 01:02:36.820
things. OK, funny story, if you really want to hear it. OK, I'm really allergic to marijuana.

01:02:37.380 --> 01:02:43.540
Like so. And you know what? I'm I'm I'm liberal enough where I'm like, if you want to smoke it

01:02:43.540 --> 01:02:47.140
in the privacy of your own home and I know people do it, you know, I don't want to get too political

01:02:47.140 --> 01:02:52.660
or whatever, but I really don't care. But I don't want people doing it around me because I get

01:02:52.660 --> 01:02:58.580
really sick and I get these really bad reactions to it. So it's it's kind of I get around the

01:02:58.580 --> 01:03:04.500
smoke. Yes, me too. You remember that time at Tia's house? Oh, yes. That was horrible. I was

01:03:04.500 --> 01:03:07.860
when they lit up in the front. You seem to be. I love that we just gave away a secret.

01:03:11.860 --> 01:03:16.260
It's all right. No, it's fine. We've been out drinking all night. Yeah. I crashed out on her

01:03:16.260 --> 01:03:25.540
bed and then I came out, of course, fully sober. Excuse me. And then I smell where it had been.

01:03:26.340 --> 01:03:31.780
Yeah. And then I went and threw up everything. Oh, yeah. Anyway, we can reminisce another time.

01:03:31.780 --> 01:03:35.460
Take care of yourself for heaven's sake. Thank you. All right. Sorry, kids.

01:03:35.460 --> 01:03:41.780
Thank you for the well wishes. Any last minute thoughts for I think I think I

01:03:41.780 --> 01:03:46.180
realized what made myself worse was that I brought the one thing I thought would be quick and easy to

01:03:46.180 --> 01:03:51.700
cook. And that was Pollock Paneer. The Trader Joe's ones uses chilies and I have a super bad

01:03:51.700 --> 01:03:57.380
chili allergy. So that's probably my own fault. Allergy plus allergy equals super allergy.

01:03:57.380 --> 01:04:03.060
Yeah. All right. And so I've got tea at home and I've got lots of Benadryl and Sudafed and Nyquil.

01:04:03.620 --> 01:04:07.780
So I might pass out or either that or you'll see me in chat. All right. Well, we hope to hear from

01:04:07.780 --> 01:04:13.140
you later. Feel better for heaven's sake. And such is the risk of doing live radio. Loki and I will

01:04:13.140 --> 01:04:17.220
hold down the fort here for the rest of the night. Thank you guys. All right. Drive safe. If you need

01:04:17.220 --> 01:04:24.820
me, call my phone and I will make sure my ringer is on. And if you need me, call me or something.

01:04:24.820 --> 01:04:29.540
You can have your 3DS charger back now. That's fine. Thank you. Okay.

01:04:30.980 --> 01:04:36.740
Back to it. Alan Alchemy in chat says, mark down that timestamp. That's an edit. No, it's live and

01:04:36.740 --> 01:04:44.980
it's funny. SSG100 Matt says, everyone's allergies change after several years. So. All right. Tiger

01:04:44.980 --> 01:04:51.220
Claw in chat says, Skye, isn't everyone allergic to marijuana? It smells so bad. Trust me. I know

01:04:51.220 --> 01:04:56.580
some people that if they're allergic to marijuana, then they are gluttons for punishment because

01:04:57.380 --> 01:05:02.820
plenty of it. Well, did I tell you about how I found out I had an allergy to it? Huh?

01:05:02.820 --> 01:05:09.140
It was a girl's bathroom at school. And I, all the other bathrooms were like being cleaned. So I went

01:05:09.140 --> 01:05:11.940
to the front bathroom that was by the office, which ironically is the one that everyone

01:05:11.940 --> 01:05:19.380
spoke to. And I got in there and I was so sick in the stall that I had to turn around and throw up.

01:05:19.380 --> 01:05:25.060
And then I had a rash on my face. It was awful. No fun at all. All right. Uh, you're gonna be

01:05:25.060 --> 01:05:30.980
okay. You sure? All right. Drive safe. Love you guys. Bye. All right. Where were we?

01:05:31.940 --> 01:05:37.060
Little big planet. That was another big announcement. How do you, how do you follow

01:05:37.060 --> 01:05:45.540
up marijuana stories by talking about little big planet? It's sack boy. He's jumping in its colors.

01:05:45.540 --> 01:05:53.700
Oh, there are all the music, man. No, no, no. Hold on. I bet you that there's quite a few

01:05:53.700 --> 01:05:59.460
marijuana inspired levels in living planet. I guarantee that there's like, Hey, I'm going to

01:05:59.460 --> 01:06:08.260
totally put pot leaves in this level. You got to get stowed. If there's a level dedicated to, um,

01:06:09.460 --> 01:06:13.460
what was her name? That actress Parker Posey. That was my favorite little big planet. I ever

01:06:13.460 --> 01:06:19.140
level I ever played was the Parker Posey level, which was like creepy stalker almost,

01:06:19.140 --> 01:06:27.700
but I loved it anyway. Ah, so little big planet hub is a free to play service coming to the

01:06:27.700 --> 01:06:32.340
PlayStation three. That's going to have many elements of the little big planet universe.

01:06:32.340 --> 01:06:37.220
A little big planet hub will allow players to collaborate with online teammates for challenges,

01:06:37.220 --> 01:06:42.020
level creation, wardrobe coordination via a redesigned shop interface.

01:06:42.020 --> 01:06:46.740
A little big planet hub is said to offer unrestricted access in quotes to the little

01:06:46.740 --> 01:06:52.180
big planets create mode 16 levels taken from previous little big planet games on the PlayStation

01:06:52.180 --> 01:06:57.700
three. And then the hub exclusive team picks will highlight a new batch of community created levels

01:06:57.700 --> 01:07:02.180
every week. And the new weekly challenges mode boasts a whole new way to play little big planet.

01:07:02.180 --> 01:07:05.460
Curious if that's going to have access to like all the levels that are created out there. Cause

01:07:05.460 --> 01:07:08.820
if that's the case and you probably don't need a single player version of the game. Well, and also

01:07:08.820 --> 01:07:12.580
it does sound like though they might nickel and dime some of the content like, cause you know,

01:07:12.580 --> 01:07:18.180
in the create mode in the games, you have to unlock that by playing the single player mode.

01:07:19.300 --> 01:07:23.700
So it's like, if you want to, you know, you can create these levels, but if you want to use the

01:07:23.700 --> 01:07:28.660
grappling hook gun, you're going to have to buy that if you want to use, you know, I think that's

01:07:28.660 --> 01:07:32.180
how they're going to do it. You'll be able to make very basic levels, but you won't be able to make

01:07:32.180 --> 01:07:38.820
the really good stuff without buying something. But I understand now it's free. Yep. Free to play

01:07:38.820 --> 01:07:43.700
allows you to get your foot in the door, but if I'm not mistaken, little big planet two is still

01:07:43.700 --> 01:07:50.740
a PlayStation plus title, right? No, no. I thought it was cardiness. Ah, gotcha. So yeah,

01:07:50.740 --> 01:07:56.660
but a little bit plant two right now, it's gotta be dirt cheap. I mean, if it's been a long time

01:07:56.660 --> 01:08:02.660
since it's been out, I mean, so right. Should be all right. All right. All right. So league of

01:08:02.660 --> 01:08:11.700
legends. Yes. Um, they got hacked and apparently there was info that was access and, um, you know,

01:08:11.700 --> 01:08:17.220
that includes, you know, usernames, email addresses, salted passwords and credit card

01:08:17.220 --> 01:08:21.540
numbers as well. But once again, those were salted, uh, which means, you know, they're

01:08:21.540 --> 01:08:27.860
encrypted and you know, they have some random stuff thrown in there as well to make it

01:08:27.860 --> 01:08:32.420
difficult, difficult to unencrypted. So while that stuff was leaked out, you probably just want to

01:08:32.420 --> 01:08:35.860
change your login password information because that's pretty much the only thing that they do

01:08:35.860 --> 01:08:42.820
have access to. Um, and you obviously, uh, you know, if you use the same login and password

01:08:42.820 --> 01:08:47.700
combination on other sites, it's going to be the first thing we try. So make sure you change that

01:08:47.700 --> 01:08:53.540
stuff. I wouldn't worry too much about the, um, credit card information and the billing information

01:08:53.540 --> 01:09:01.220
stuff because, you know, that stuff was encrypted and it looks like that it would be difficult for

01:09:01.220 --> 01:09:07.300
them to crack all that. But still never good to hear that again. League of legends is a huge game

01:09:07.300 --> 01:09:12.420
too. It's not good to hear that they got hacked. Now, luckily I used a unique password for league

01:09:12.420 --> 01:09:15.860
of legends cause I just kind of thought something like this might happen, but now I'm going to need

01:09:15.860 --> 01:09:20.100
a second unique password cause they're going to make everybody change it. I haven't logged in in

01:09:20.100 --> 01:09:24.820
a week though. Yeah. They say that, you know, they're taking the appropriate action into

01:09:24.820 --> 01:09:28.820
notify and safeguard effective players is that we'll be contacting these players via email

01:09:28.820 --> 01:09:33.460
addresses currently associated with their accounts to alert them. Our investigation is ongoing and

01:09:33.460 --> 01:09:39.940
we take all the necessary steps to protect players. So, all right. Well, you didn't have a

01:09:39.940 --> 01:09:43.460
league of legends account so you don't have to worry about it, right? Don't play it. So not a

01:09:43.460 --> 01:09:47.220
problem. Lucky you. Yep. Yep. Yep. Lucky you. All right. Let's travel around the world and check

01:09:47.220 --> 01:09:51.700
out some release dates and what's coming out to a gaming store near you. Few things this week,

01:09:51.700 --> 01:09:57.860
lost planet three on PlayStation three and Xbox 360. Little known fact about lost planet three.

01:09:57.860 --> 01:10:02.180
I don't think Capcom thinks it's going to do very well. So they're not making any reprints of it.

01:10:02.820 --> 01:10:07.540
Once the launch quantities are gone, it's gone. Apparently. Really? I don't believe that though.

01:10:07.540 --> 01:10:12.580
If it were to do very well, which I kind of agree with Capcom in this regard, I don't think it will

01:10:12.580 --> 01:10:18.580
do very well. Sorry. Uh, but if it does, I mean, they can always just reprint it. Not what they

01:10:18.580 --> 01:10:22.580
did with like Katamari Damacy and some of these other minimally. And I think, I think that a lot

01:10:22.580 --> 01:10:26.100
of that is just to get the buzz out there. So that's information gets out. So they're like,

01:10:26.100 --> 01:10:31.220
Oh, I need to get it because I won't be able to get it otherwise. No, no, don't, don't bother.

01:10:31.220 --> 01:10:37.860
Uh, Final Fantasy 14 out this weekend, PC and PlayStation three, uh, killer is dead on

01:10:37.860 --> 01:10:44.020
PlayStation three and Xbox three 60. If you're a fan of Suda 51 and to be at Jamie left,

01:10:44.020 --> 01:10:51.380
but a hot sunay Miku project diva F on PlayStation three this week. And, uh, was it last but not

01:10:51.380 --> 01:11:00.980
least Madden NFL 25 coming out? Oh, and painkiller Helen damnation on PS3. All right. Let's travel

01:11:00.980 --> 01:11:05.620
to Japan and then maybe you can pick up the UK dates here that we would usually do. Cause I'm

01:11:05.620 --> 01:11:09.460
trying to replace the classic game of the week here. So I don't want to take Jamie's game.

01:11:09.460 --> 01:11:16.740
I'm working frantically on that. Um, all while we're doing live radio. So trying to go to the

01:11:16.740 --> 01:11:24.260
Japanese release dates and here they are on the PlayStation three this week on August the 27th,

01:11:24.260 --> 01:11:30.740
Final Fantasy 14 makes its way to Japan as well. The name there, Final Fantasy 14 online,

01:11:30.740 --> 01:11:38.100
Shinsei yours. And yours is the name of the realm that we all play in. Um, like Azeroth is in, in

01:11:38.100 --> 01:11:42.740
world of Warcraft. So, uh, I'm assuming that is their own interpretation of what we have as the

01:11:42.740 --> 01:11:49.300
subtitle realm reborn as out in Japan on the 27th as well on the 29th, which I believe is Thursday,

01:11:49.300 --> 01:11:53.940
or which is a more typical release day there you get end of eternity, getting a price reduction

01:11:53.940 --> 01:11:59.620
on PlayStation three, Joe Joe's bizarre adventure, all star battle and lost planet three gets

01:11:59.620 --> 01:12:04.420
Japanese release as well. So if all the U S copies disappear, you could always import one.

01:12:05.140 --> 01:12:10.740
Uh, assuming you have a region free PlayStation three, uh, Xbox three 60 has must Monster Hunter

01:12:10.740 --> 01:12:17.860
frontier G anniversary, 2013 premium package coming out on the 28th of August and lost planet

01:12:17.860 --> 01:12:23.060
three on the Xbox three 60 as well. I have no idea what's in that repackaging a Monster Hunter, but

01:12:23.060 --> 01:12:29.060
it's pretty popular over there on the PlayStation Vita. Hotchkiss comes out on August 29th as does

01:12:29.060 --> 01:12:33.700
Ragnarok Odyssey ACE. I don't know if that's the same Ragnarok adventures game we got.

01:12:34.660 --> 01:12:39.780
Yeah. There's been another Ragnarok, um, Odyssey games ACE I think was one that was on

01:12:40.500 --> 01:12:46.740
DS or three DS. It was, it's, I think that's a new, a re-release or something or not re-release,

01:12:46.740 --> 01:12:54.260
but a port. Um, sadly, no, uh, Wii U games this week. Uh, I saw some Disney infinity on my list,

01:12:54.260 --> 01:12:57.860
but I think that's just a, I think some people over there are importing ours.

01:12:59.460 --> 01:13:02.820
I don't think it's out in Japan yet, and I'm not sure there's plans to do that there with

01:13:02.820 --> 01:13:06.900
all the toys and everything. I just, it's probably not as practical, but I bet there's some people

01:13:06.900 --> 01:13:11.380
over there importing our version of it. Probably. You never really hear about the imports the other

01:13:11.380 --> 01:13:14.100
way around, but I would think that's one of those games that there's people in Japan that

01:13:14.100 --> 01:13:18.820
are importing it for the figures. Disney's very popular in Japan. I can imagine. Yeah.

01:13:18.820 --> 01:13:25.140
Nintendo three DS gets Sherlock Holmes puzzle city and starry sky in autumn three D in regular

01:13:25.140 --> 01:13:29.860
and limited edition. And I was going to see real quick if there's anything on the PSP,

01:13:29.860 --> 01:13:32.820
because believe it or not, they still get releases there once in a while. And, uh,

01:13:32.820 --> 01:13:38.180
Solomon's ring elemental pack comes out on the Sony PS. I completely forgot actually on the PSP

01:13:38.180 --> 01:13:45.380
this week, sweet fuse at your side, I think is the name. And that's a PSP title coming out over here.

01:13:45.940 --> 01:13:51.940
Visual novel access go figure, but not those visual novel tiles, man. All right. Just a couple

01:13:51.940 --> 01:13:56.580
more stories for you guys. And then the classic game of the week. Um, let's see in the UK, we're

01:13:56.580 --> 01:14:02.020
getting, um, counseling Lords of shadows, and this is on PC. I'm assuming that's coming to steam

01:14:02.020 --> 01:14:08.420
final fantasy 14 realm reborn on PlayStation three and PC, uh, also on Mac Bioshock infinite. I

01:14:08.420 --> 01:14:13.140
believe it's also coming out here as well on steam, uh, guardians of middle earth, also a PC

01:14:13.140 --> 01:14:19.860
release. Um, they're getting, uh, etrian odyssey for legends of the Titan on three DS, uh, killer

01:14:19.860 --> 01:14:25.620
is dead on PlayStation three and Xbox three 60 also lost planet three on Xbox three 60

01:14:25.620 --> 01:14:31.060
PlayStation three and PC. Of course, PC being the steam, uh, Rayman legends actually coming

01:14:31.060 --> 01:14:36.180
out a little bit early over there on Wii U and PC, Xbox three 60 and PlayStation three.

01:14:36.900 --> 01:14:42.660
And then, uh, some stuff that doesn't have a date on it, but it's just marked August,

01:14:42.660 --> 01:14:47.540
the walking dead 400 days and payday too. I'm not sure that stuff's already been out yet, but

01:14:47.540 --> 01:14:56.580
it is over here. So that's it. All right. Um, so let's talk a little bit about some other stuff

01:14:56.580 --> 01:14:59.620
that they discussed during the PlayStation conference. And actually a lot of this was

01:15:00.180 --> 01:15:08.660
leaked out beforehand, but the Vita got a price drop one 99 in the U S and 199 Euro in Europe.

01:15:10.020 --> 01:15:16.820
Also, it should be mentioned that the PlayStation three 12 gigabyte system came out here over, uh,

01:15:16.820 --> 01:15:21.300
as well because it is in Europe and that's also one 99. So PlayStation three and

01:15:22.260 --> 01:15:26.980
Vita for one idea and I'm, and they actually do have a bundle too. Uh, and the one 99 price

01:15:26.980 --> 01:15:31.620
points for like the three G one. And they also have like the walking dead. They have a bundle

01:15:31.620 --> 01:15:36.020
that's also one 99 as well. So do you think this is enough to kind of get a fire lit under the

01:15:36.020 --> 01:15:40.260
Vita's butt or is this too little too late? It will help, but they have some pretty good games

01:15:40.260 --> 01:15:43.540
coming out. And especially a lot of these indie games that are going to be cross platform with,

01:15:43.540 --> 01:15:48.340
you know, PlayStation Vita as well. They have a lot of content coming in. It's going to be

01:15:48.340 --> 01:15:53.300
advertising that content to, uh, the consumer, I think is going to be the toughest part,

01:15:53.300 --> 01:15:57.380
especially since they don't really have any huge games coming out outside from like tear away

01:15:57.940 --> 01:16:03.540
and, um, kill zone, kill zone will be good. That's supposed to be actually a really good

01:16:03.540 --> 01:16:08.340
first person shooter. Um, I heard rumors that they may do a Vita version of ghosts,

01:16:08.900 --> 01:16:13.940
but it would have to be somebody other than, uh, I can't remember the developer, but the guy,

01:16:13.940 --> 01:16:20.020
the guys that did fucking resistance and call of duty last year that just sucked. They were

01:16:20.020 --> 01:16:24.820
terrible. Um, so as long as they get somebody else to develop that it would be pretty good.

01:16:24.820 --> 01:16:29.060
Borderlands two is going to help too. So I re will it because I'm going to be honest,

01:16:29.060 --> 01:16:32.420
when I heard the news about Borderlands two on the Vita, I was kind of like, no, don't get me

01:16:32.420 --> 01:16:36.340
wrong. Borderlands two awesome game. I know people are really into it and rightfully so,

01:16:36.340 --> 01:16:40.660
but I'm kind of like, hasn't everybody who's going to get Borderlands two already got it.

01:16:40.660 --> 01:16:48.100
All right. All right. All right. Minecraft. True. True. That could be said for a lot of games,

01:16:48.100 --> 01:16:52.500
I guess, but Minecraft on the go, man. And I understand. Yeah, they have the pocket edition,

01:16:52.500 --> 01:17:01.140
but if this version is a little bit more like the PC version, oh, that it's all sorts of greatness.

01:17:01.140 --> 01:17:06.820
Um, okay. Maybe it could talk to the PC version or the PS3 version would be very awesome.

01:17:06.820 --> 01:17:10.500
It would be awesome if it was, you know, I don't think you could do the PS4, but if all

01:17:10.500 --> 01:17:14.740
three versions talk to each other, they'd be fantastic. Um, Sony's not as much of a hard

01:17:14.740 --> 01:17:21.060
ass on the play, uh, the PC communicating with Sony servers. I mean, we see DC universe online

01:17:21.060 --> 01:17:25.220
is on both, even though I don't think their servers are cross-play, but final fantasy 14

01:17:25.220 --> 01:17:29.300
just came out and it's cross-played between the two. Um, what there's something else I'm

01:17:29.300 --> 01:17:33.300
thinking of this PC and, and, uh, PlayStation cross. Oh, well like this, the whole steam

01:17:33.300 --> 01:17:37.060
integration and a portal. I think the problem though with doing that is a lot of it, they have

01:17:37.060 --> 01:17:41.460
to develop the engine to be similar because they want the same draw distance and same features in

01:17:41.460 --> 01:17:46.500
there. And if, if one is significantly less power than the other one, they can't really do that.

01:17:47.140 --> 01:17:52.660
Um, but I don't know. Anyway, so yeah, Borderlands two, that's supposed to come in 2014 sometime.

01:17:52.660 --> 01:17:57.220
I'm thinking maybe holiday cause it, you know, no date yet. Really good comment from Monty Boggs

01:17:57.220 --> 01:18:01.940
in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com. If I can transfer PlayStation three data,

01:18:01.940 --> 01:18:06.660
Borderlands two Vito would be tempting. Transfarring, wasn't that the whole term

01:18:06.660 --> 01:18:12.340
that Konami came up with a while ago? Transfarring your data. That is, I I'll give you that. That is

01:18:12.340 --> 01:18:18.820
a pretty, pretty good reason to not do it. Um, the whole thing would depend on if the game is

01:18:18.820 --> 01:18:23.940
going to have all the same guns in it. If they, they develop all the same assets that are in the,

01:18:24.500 --> 01:18:29.620
uh, PlayStation three version, then yes, they could do that because you can swap between,

01:18:29.620 --> 01:18:34.820
you can basically dump your save from PlayStation three, convert it to an Xbox three 60 or,

01:18:34.820 --> 01:18:39.700
you know, PC format and stuff. You can do that already. Um, with some mod tools, but

01:18:39.700 --> 01:18:46.500
if you can, if they have all, shouldn't it all be in the cloud? Well, it all depends though.

01:18:46.500 --> 01:18:51.460
Cause like if, if they have all that information, maybe they could do it without the guns. I don't

01:18:51.460 --> 01:18:55.860
know. It would be, it's possible. Depends on the content that's in the game. I think that they

01:18:55.860 --> 01:19:01.540
could bring in all the guns, but we'll see. Um, also the Vita memory cards, one of the things

01:19:01.540 --> 01:19:06.580
that people were complaining about a lot because they are pretty expensive, um, are being reduced

01:19:06.580 --> 01:19:13.060
in price as well. Um, so apparently they are, I don't remember the final amounts to those.

01:19:13.620 --> 01:19:19.140
Let's see. So the Vita memory cards previously, for example, four gigabyte memory card is now

01:19:19.140 --> 01:19:25.780
$14.99 whereas originally $20. Uh, the eight gigabyte memory card is now $19.99 where it was

01:19:25.780 --> 01:19:35.540
30, 16 is a $39.99 where it was 60 and the 32 gigabyte, um, card is $80 where it was a hundred.

01:19:35.540 --> 01:19:40.180
So they are knocking the price off of those. Um, it still sucks that it's proprietary, but

01:19:41.620 --> 01:19:46.580
what are you going to do? I mean, might as well invest in a pretty big memory card because,

01:19:46.580 --> 01:19:51.380
you know, especially if you do PlayStation Plus, get a bunch of freebies. I think that's also

01:19:51.380 --> 01:19:56.340
another strong point. If they market that well enough, it's like, hey, you buy, you know,

01:19:56.340 --> 01:20:01.060
PlayStation Vita, you get PlayStation Plus, you can download a ton of fucking games. So why not?

01:20:01.060 --> 01:20:04.580
It would be very, if they can really bring, if the Vita has a Renaissance or whatever you want

01:20:04.580 --> 01:20:08.100
to call it, where it really does kind of seem to take off this holiday season and essentially

01:20:08.100 --> 01:20:13.060
resurrect from the dead. Uh, you can't tell me that the Wii U can't do the same thing.

01:20:13.060 --> 01:20:19.300
They need a price drop because the Wii U is still $349. That's not going to cut it.

01:20:19.300 --> 01:20:23.940
We have something later on that might sweeten the pot a little bit, but I kind of agree that

01:20:23.940 --> 01:20:28.260
there's going to be, need to be a hard drop, uh, or Nintendo is going to be in trouble, but

01:20:29.140 --> 01:20:31.380
not that there's not a lot of great games coming, but.

01:20:34.740 --> 01:20:39.700
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com,

01:20:39.700 --> 01:20:46.820
use the passphrase, judge. All right. Anyhow, um, let's move on to one more story here about

01:20:46.820 --> 01:20:50.260
Killer Instinct and some new information that came out about the game this week.

01:20:50.260 --> 01:20:54.420
One of those details, uh, in the free to play version of Killer Instinct, you will be able to

01:20:54.420 --> 01:21:01.060
buy the additional characters for $5 each. Killer Instinct will be free to play with one character

01:21:01.060 --> 01:21:07.460
when the console comes out. There will be a 1999 combo breaker pack that unlocks the game's full

01:21:07.460 --> 01:21:15.140
roster of eight characters, including two of them that are exclusive fighters that are not initially

01:21:15.140 --> 01:21:21.060
available for individual purchase. Meaning if you do piecemeal your game, you will have six

01:21:21.060 --> 01:21:28.260
fighters to choose from. There will also be a $40 ultra edition that will bundle all playable

01:21:28.260 --> 01:21:35.700
characters, also an accessory and costume pack thingy and the original 1994 arcade version

01:21:35.700 --> 01:21:40.500
of Killer Instinct, which has a lot of people more happy about the arcade version on their

01:21:40.500 --> 01:21:44.420
Xbox One than I think some people are about the new Killer Instinct. If you think there's only eight

01:21:44.420 --> 01:21:49.140
characters in this game, you're full of crap because they're gonna fucking put DLC out there.

01:21:49.140 --> 01:21:55.140
They're gonna make you buy those fucking characters. Well, I think yes and no. I think it will be eight

01:21:55.140 --> 01:22:00.740
this year. And then depending on how the game does, because this is how they're talking, they're saying

01:22:00.740 --> 01:22:06.740
well you will have the 2013 season that has these eight characters and then next year we can put

01:22:06.740 --> 01:22:11.860
along eight more characters and put that into the game. I'm literally hearing, and I'm trying to be

01:22:11.860 --> 01:22:16.740
open and understanding, but what I'm literally hearing is we're making it up as we go along.

01:22:17.700 --> 01:22:24.740
Eight characters in a fighting game seems kind of lame and the whole charging $5 for the characters

01:22:24.740 --> 01:22:30.500
is basically to get you to buy the $20 pack. They never were intending for you to buy piecemeal

01:22:30.500 --> 01:22:33.780
characters. They're just like, yeah, we'll put it there. They want to be able to say it's free

01:22:33.780 --> 01:22:38.340
to play. Well, we'll put it there so that it, you know, people want to buy the $20 pack. That's all

01:22:38.340 --> 01:22:43.300
it really comes down to. And $20 for a fighting game is not a bad thing. Eight characters does

01:22:43.300 --> 01:22:50.020
seem quite low, but that's the original Street Fighter II had eight characters and even then

01:22:50.020 --> 01:22:56.740
there were still four bosses on top of that. So that's just the only, you know, and it's not the

01:22:56.740 --> 01:23:02.820
Street Fighter II was a bad game. It's just not 1991 anymore. You know, and I did get a tweet

01:23:02.820 --> 01:23:06.980
earlier this week and I apologize. I forgot the username of who sent it, but the tweet said,

01:23:06.980 --> 01:23:11.540
because I said I was shading the fact that there was only the, you know, eight characters and I

01:23:11.540 --> 01:23:17.780
got a tweet that said, what about quality over quantity? And I was, I never responded to it

01:23:17.780 --> 01:23:20.980
because I was mobile or something like that. But honestly, my answer to that is, wait a minute

01:23:20.980 --> 01:23:26.020
though. Part of the reason that make fighting games so much fun is kind of the diversity of the

01:23:26.020 --> 01:23:30.980
roster. And you look at the fighting games that come out today, eight characters doesn't cut it

01:23:30.980 --> 01:23:36.660
anymore. You know, you gotta have at least 15, 20, how many did the new Mortal Kombat have? Like,

01:23:36.660 --> 01:23:42.980
you know, you have a good, a good diverse roster makes the game more fun. Eight characters sounds

01:23:42.980 --> 01:23:47.700
like we rushed this game to get it out for the launch. Like a lot of the other games that have

01:23:47.700 --> 01:23:53.460
been coming out launched for the platform seems like a lot of it's rushed and maybe, you know,

01:23:53.460 --> 01:23:57.860
bring out more characters later on so they can sell it as DLC. I think originally this game is

01:23:57.860 --> 01:24:02.420
probably going to be a retail release, but they just can't get it done in time. That's what really

01:24:02.420 --> 01:24:06.980
concerns me is that all these signs are pointing, you know, it's like these warning signs are popping

01:24:06.980 --> 01:24:11.700
up about this game. And I, it has me really concerned. Well, I don't think it's just this

01:24:11.700 --> 01:24:17.700
game. It's like Forza 5, for example, where it's shipping unfinished, you know, come on.

01:24:17.940 --> 01:24:21.460
That's just, I, so why? It's a day one patch. Okay. I understand that. But

01:24:22.420 --> 01:24:27.940
dude, it's, you better hope that your servers are fucking working day one because there's going to

01:24:27.940 --> 01:24:32.260
be some piss people. Well, I guess not because there's still content in the game, but you're

01:24:32.260 --> 01:24:37.540
just not gonna be able to play the full thing yet. And here's the other thing. I kind of don't trust

01:24:37.540 --> 01:24:42.660
Microsoft to keep it going and I'm going to use my big old standby that I always bring up on the

01:24:42.660 --> 01:24:45.940
show and you're sick of hearing me talk about it. Well, there's two of them member. Oh, well,

01:24:45.940 --> 01:24:51.220
the one I've got in my mind is remember when they said we're going to bring a thousand games to

01:24:51.220 --> 01:24:57.300
game room. And then what happened about 200 came out across 13 packs and they pulled the plug.

01:24:57.300 --> 01:25:03.380
So those thousand games never happened. So isn't it feasible that if Killer Instinct comes out and

01:25:04.020 --> 01:25:08.260
heaven forbid, it's not very good and people just aren't into it because there's not enough

01:25:08.260 --> 01:25:13.780
characters. Do you think that 2014 pack will ever happen? Nope. No, because Microsoft will pull the

01:25:13.780 --> 01:25:19.380
plug on it because they have a history of pulling the plug on things. Uh, that, that could have been

01:25:19.380 --> 01:25:23.620
even better if it just had a little more time. Oh, Oh, I thought of the other one, one versus a

01:25:23.620 --> 01:25:29.700
hundred. Is that the other one? That would have been the other one or just those interactive game

01:25:29.700 --> 01:25:40.660
shows in general. Grr. Anyhow, or an actual legitimate use for the Xbox. Weiland in our chat

01:25:40.660 --> 01:25:45.780
room says I'm waiting for a PC Killer Instinct. Is that something they said is going to happen?

01:25:45.780 --> 01:25:51.620
Cause I don't know if I would see that happen. Um, probably not just because they want every

01:25:51.620 --> 01:25:56.580
way to purchase the Xbox one stuff. I think maybe later on down the line, one windows eight takes

01:25:56.580 --> 01:26:02.180
off and a lot more people have windows eight and that windows marketplace is more of a, you know,

01:26:02.180 --> 01:26:07.140
robust thing. Then maybe you'll see stuff like that popping up there, but I just don't see it

01:26:07.140 --> 01:26:10.740
happening. I don't know. All right. There's some other killer instinct news. I do want to make

01:26:10.740 --> 01:26:14.900
sure I cover cause it's not just that, but there's also, um, another fighter that's been revealed

01:26:14.900 --> 01:26:19.620
that they're calling a spider woman. Uh, it was teased at the end of a video that was posted. It

01:26:19.620 --> 01:26:24.820
sounds like prematurely by game trailers. Uh, this character has the ability to throw spider

01:26:24.820 --> 01:26:29.460
webs to attack and ensnare opponents. And she has a pair of blades on the back of each hand

01:26:29.460 --> 01:26:34.900
and a blades on her forearms and so forth. Does not look like a previous killer instinct fighter,

01:26:34.900 --> 01:26:39.940
which is fine game should, you know, new fighting games and a franchise should have some new people.

01:26:39.940 --> 01:26:44.340
But, um, I bet there, I bet there's going to be some people that are a little irritated,

01:26:44.340 --> 01:26:50.740
like, all right, so there's going to be eight fighters and we're going to fill them all up

01:26:50.740 --> 01:26:55.620
with slots of, of people that are, that are new and not like where, where's orchid,

01:26:55.620 --> 01:27:02.820
where's spinal. Those are coming in the DLC pack. The most, the most popular character will be one

01:27:02.820 --> 01:27:06.740
of the two. I bet you orchid will be in there, but she'll be one of those characters that you

01:27:06.740 --> 01:27:10.980
can only get when you buy, you can't piecemeal her. She'll be in that $20 combo pack. You have

01:27:10.980 --> 01:27:15.140
to get her that way. I bet you that's how it works. Um, this is pretty cool news though,

01:27:15.140 --> 01:27:20.100
despite all this, you know, negative things we might be saying about Killer Instinct.

01:27:20.100 --> 01:27:26.020
Uh, this is pretty neat. Uh, creative director Adam Isgreen and producer Torrin Redding talking

01:27:26.020 --> 01:27:31.540
about Killer Instinct mentioned the original announcer, Chris Sutherland, will be selectable

01:27:31.540 --> 01:27:35.300
in lieu of the new announcer for Killer Instinct. So if you want to have the, uh,

01:27:35.300 --> 01:27:40.500
old Killer Instinct experience when it comes to the announcer, you can do that. Uh, I guess he

01:27:40.500 --> 01:27:46.260
did rerecord some lines and, uh, even though it's been 18 years later, sounds exactly the same. So

01:27:46.260 --> 01:27:51.220
it sounds like he's aged a little better than DuckTales did. Oh, I went there. Why didn't they

01:27:51.220 --> 01:27:55.460
just have him do it in the beginning? I mean, just have him be the guy. It is a little weird,

01:27:55.460 --> 01:28:01.060
isn't it? Because maybe, maybe what they didn't say, they said Chris Sutherland will be selectable

01:28:01.140 --> 01:28:09.780
in a 4.99 DLC pack. 4.99? Try $40 deals. $40 pack. For an announcer? Yeah, no, I bet you

01:28:09.780 --> 01:28:15.460
$40 because you get the original game. So you get the original announcer too. Uh, maybe, maybe. Uh,

01:28:16.100 --> 01:28:20.260
but I wasn't, well, Dota 2 sells these announcer packs. It's part of the way they make money.

01:28:20.260 --> 01:28:26.900
They're free to play. Who knows? Tigerclaw in our chat pointing out, uh, is that character I

01:28:26.900 --> 01:28:32.420
mentioned earlier? They can't call her Spiderwoman anyway, obviously. I wasn't calling her that,

01:28:32.420 --> 01:28:37.540
but that's, she looks like that type of character. Dota 2 announcer packs. I saw the one from GLaDOS

01:28:37.540 --> 01:28:42.580
and like one of the lines in there is it's, it's Oda. The D is silent.

01:28:48.020 --> 01:28:52.980
Wow. All right. Uh, are we ready to get to the classic game of the week? Back in the day,

01:28:52.980 --> 01:28:59.220
you didn't have to pay $5 per character. You got all of it or you got nothing.

01:28:59.220 --> 01:29:02.020
And that takes us to a segment we call the classic game of the week.

01:29:04.260 --> 01:29:09.700
Where DarkSakura will dive into the gaming vault, but not this week because she dived into her bed

01:29:09.700 --> 01:29:13.940
to rest tonight. So I will dive into the gaming vault in her place and pick a game that you all

01:29:13.940 --> 01:29:17.700
should be playing this week. Sorry, I'm laughing because Rama in the chat room says, screw you,

01:29:17.700 --> 01:29:22.020
Rob Roberts, DuckTales hater. Now wait a minute, wait a minute, put the brakes on for a minute.

01:29:22.980 --> 01:29:27.620
I didn't hate DuckTales. Go back and listen to my review last week. I just said there was,

01:29:28.740 --> 01:29:33.380
I had two major issues with it. One, the sound production values on the console release were not

01:29:33.380 --> 01:29:38.260
very good. Uh, that's not saying the voice talent wasn't very good, although they're clearly showing

01:29:38.260 --> 01:29:43.620
their age, but Jun Fure is what like 95? Bless her heart that she can still do the game and sound as

01:29:43.620 --> 01:29:48.180
good as she does. Uh, which is why I wish the sound production would have lended their talents

01:29:48.180 --> 01:29:52.740
better to that. And two, I did not like that the cut scenes constantly interrupted the action

01:29:52.740 --> 01:30:01.460
all the time in what should be a very action-based game. That being said, let's go back in the classic

01:30:01.460 --> 01:30:06.180
game of the week and find a game that you should all be playing this week. Now I will say this,

01:30:06.180 --> 01:30:11.220
I switched out the game at the last minute because the game that Janie picked, I want her to be able

01:30:11.220 --> 01:30:17.380
to talk about the game and it's not a game I ever played. So I switched it out and one of the games

01:30:17.380 --> 01:30:21.780
I have on the back burner to talk about, I wanted to share with you guys one of these days, uh, was

01:30:21.780 --> 01:30:25.540
a game available on the Commodore 64 because you know I'm going to use this opportunity to do a

01:30:25.540 --> 01:30:31.940
Commodore 64 game. Uh, the game is called the Great Gianna Sisters is the game I picked tonight.

01:30:35.780 --> 01:30:40.740
Now the Great Gianna Sisters, some of you have probably heard of this game because there's the

01:30:40.740 --> 01:30:45.860
Gianna Sisters Twisted Dreams, which is an indie game, uh, that just came out on what, Steam

01:30:45.860 --> 01:30:50.980
Greenline? I think it's available on Xbox Arcade, right? And PlayStation? Yeah. So yes, its roots are

01:30:50.980 --> 01:30:59.220
in this very old Commodore game. It was released in 19- 1987. It was done by Time Warp Productions

01:30:59.220 --> 01:31:04.500
and then published by Rainbow Arts. It was actually on the Amiga. A lot of people know it

01:31:04.500 --> 01:31:10.500
from the Amiga as well. The versions were on the MSX2, Atari ST, and the Amstrad CPC.

01:31:11.140 --> 01:31:16.020
The Commodore 64 version was programmed by Armin Gessert and the graphics were done by

01:31:16.020 --> 01:31:24.100
Manfred Trenz and the soundtrack was composed by Chris Huelsbeck. Uh, funny note, he came back later

01:31:24.100 --> 01:31:28.500
to do the soundtracks for these later games that came out. There was also a DS game, uh, much later.

01:31:28.500 --> 01:31:35.220
Yeah, I played the DS game and it was alright. Now the license is currently held by Black Forest Games

01:31:35.220 --> 01:31:40.180
who did the modern day sequel, Gianna Sisters Twisted Dreams. In the game you take the role of

01:31:40.180 --> 01:31:45.780
Gianna, a girl who fell asleep and finds herself in a dream world populated by monsters. You go

01:31:45.780 --> 01:31:50.420
through the world and you are looking for a diamond which will wake her from the sleep and

01:31:50.420 --> 01:31:56.820
return her to waking life. Now, most people know this game. If you've heard of this game, you know

01:31:56.820 --> 01:32:01.700
it because it was a very controversial game when it came out on the Commodore 64 because

01:32:02.820 --> 01:32:09.540
it looked a lot like Super Mario Brothers down to the fact that they did the whole World 1-1 thing.

01:32:09.540 --> 01:32:14.740
What do I mean by that? Well, whenever a level creator comes out for a game, what's the first

01:32:14.740 --> 01:32:23.220
thing people usually make? A penis and then after that World 1-1 from Super Mario Brothers, right?

01:32:23.220 --> 01:32:30.340
Yeah. So, unfortunately in the case of the great Gianna Sisters, World 1 is pretty much World 1-1

01:32:30.340 --> 01:32:34.820
from Super Mario Brothers. So the first level is almost identical in layout to Super Mario

01:32:34.820 --> 01:32:40.660
Brothers and the game itself shares some similarities too. You pick up a magical pinwheel,

01:32:40.660 --> 01:32:46.180
it makes you bigger and you don't throw a fireball per se, but it's a bouncing ball

01:32:46.180 --> 01:32:52.900
just like the Game Boy version of Super Mario Brothers. But anyway,

01:32:53.860 --> 01:32:59.780
Nintendo pressured the makers of the great Gianna Sisters threatening legal action if they do not

01:32:59.780 --> 01:33:05.060
take appropriate action. The game was voluntarily withdrawn from sale. No lawsuits or anything like

01:33:05.060 --> 01:33:11.540
that, but it was voluntarily withdrawn. Therefore, it makes this game very rare. Now, what they

01:33:11.540 --> 01:33:16.500
don't say about the controversy and you don't know this unless you've played the game, the later

01:33:16.500 --> 01:33:21.140
levels don't really look like Mario Brothers levels. I would say maybe the second level has

01:33:21.140 --> 01:33:25.540
a little bit in common too, but I think there's 20 some-odd levels in the game and especially when

01:33:25.540 --> 01:33:30.980
you get into later levels and some of the boss fights, it isn't like Mario Brothers in that regard.

01:33:30.980 --> 01:33:35.300
But unfortunately, a lot of the basic game mechanics, you know, with the whole power-ups

01:33:35.300 --> 01:33:41.220
and getting coins and jumping on the coin blocks and so forth, that is all still pretty similar. So

01:33:41.220 --> 01:33:46.660
it probably was in this company's best interest to take the game off the market. But this is what

01:33:46.660 --> 01:33:52.180
makes this game such a cult classic and why people desire it is that, you know, it was in a sense a

01:33:52.180 --> 01:33:59.380
Super Mario-like game on a 1983 Commodore 64 and the soundtrack, the soundtrack, the soundtrack.

01:33:59.380 --> 01:34:05.140
People love the soundtrack and rightfully so. Great, great music available in the game.

01:34:06.100 --> 01:34:11.700
So it's no wonder that they brought Chris Hulsbeck back to do the later games.

01:34:12.980 --> 01:34:20.100
So very well received, very highly rated in a lot of old Commodore 64 productions. Zzap 64 giving

01:34:20.100 --> 01:34:27.780
it 96%. There are various ports out there, but the ZX Spectrum port that was planned was pulled

01:34:27.780 --> 01:34:35.780
back because of the legal pressures. In 1993, the MSX version came out. The game had been ported to

01:34:35.780 --> 01:34:43.140
Windows, DOS, Linux, but all unofficially. Also a Nintendo DS version unofficially of the Commodore

01:34:43.140 --> 01:34:50.740
64 port, not to be confused with the official sequel of Gianna Sisters. There was also a mobile

01:34:50.740 --> 01:34:59.220
version of the game made for Android phones in 2005. There was a sequel planned for the game

01:34:59.220 --> 01:35:05.380
called Gianna 2, Arthur and Martha in Future World and it was supposed to have a futuristic setting,

01:35:05.380 --> 01:35:12.020
but because of all the legal troubles, Time Warp renamed the game Hard and Heavy and changed the

01:35:12.020 --> 01:35:16.180
protagonist to Robots. So if you've ever played the game Hard and Heavy, which came out on the

01:35:16.180 --> 01:35:21.060
Commodore 64 in 1989, that was inspired by Gianna Sisters. It was supposed to be the sequel.

01:35:22.260 --> 01:35:28.820
So Gianna Sisters DS was an actual sequel that did come out in 2009 and then of course I think

01:35:28.820 --> 01:35:34.100
a lot of you know through Steam and so forth in July 2012 and the Kickstarter,

01:35:34.100 --> 01:35:41.940
Gianna Sisters Twisted Dreams became a reality. So there you go, the classic game of the week,

01:35:41.940 --> 01:35:47.220
the Gianna Sisters, the great Gianna Sisters. Yeah, have you ever heard of this game in your

01:35:47.220 --> 01:35:52.500
life, Loki? Yes, I have played it actually. Do you like it? I mean, it's all right. You have

01:35:52.500 --> 01:35:56.100
to remember it was Commodore 64 games were a little more basic. They have it on the Ouya,

01:35:56.100 --> 01:36:02.100
you can actually get like the DS version of the game ported over. So they have that available

01:36:02.100 --> 01:36:08.340
and I have played that DS version of the game as well. It's all right. Tigerclaw in Chat says,

01:36:08.340 --> 01:36:13.380
does that new Gianna Sisters game poke fun at Nintendo despite them? No, it's pretty badass

01:36:13.380 --> 01:36:17.860
actually. Yeah, and actually, yeah, the game doesn't play. I mean, the good thing is they

01:36:17.860 --> 01:36:22.260
turn this, it's still a platforming game, but it's way different now and it is badass. Like you flip

01:36:22.260 --> 01:36:27.460
between the sisters and it causes changes in the environment and yeah, I've played through a bit

01:36:27.460 --> 01:36:31.620
of it on Steam and it's a fun little game to play. I think I talked about it on a previous episode

01:36:31.620 --> 01:36:37.700
of the show, but as far as like a straight up platformer goes, it's a lot of fun. Shadow Next

01:36:37.700 --> 01:36:42.980
Gen says, has Rob played the modern port of Gianna Sisters? No, I haven't. I played the DS

01:36:42.980 --> 01:36:49.540
one and I played this new one, Twisted Sisters. I did not even know until doing last minute research

01:36:49.540 --> 01:36:54.900
for the article tonight that there was later ports that came on. So by the way, look at what

01:36:54.900 --> 01:37:00.820
she's fighting here in this video. It's like a giant enemy crab. This game was just ahead of its

01:37:00.820 --> 01:37:08.180
time. The Great Gianna Sisters, classic game of the week. How about that? Did I do good with,

01:37:08.180 --> 01:37:14.180
with 15 minutes to pick a game? Anyhow, we're going to take a quick break. And when we come

01:37:14.180 --> 01:37:18.180
back with more of Orange Lounge Radio, we got more news for you guys. The Fugu question of the week,

01:37:18.180 --> 01:37:21.540
I know our beginnings of the show was a little Sony heavy. So we are going to talk about some

01:37:21.540 --> 01:37:26.820
of the goings on in Microsoft's world. Uh, don't have a lot in Nintendo news this week. Uh, that

01:37:26.820 --> 01:37:30.980
was more a couple of weeks ago, but with their Nintendo Directs and so forth, we do have at

01:37:30.980 --> 01:37:34.340
least one big piece of Nintendo news coming up after the break. And then of course, most

01:37:34.340 --> 01:37:41.060
importantly, your calls, your emails, your voices. When we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:37:47.140 --> 01:37:53.860
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio in progress with episode number 517 of our program,

01:37:54.420 --> 01:38:01.140
August 25th, 2013. Um, and of course there is no show over Labor Day weekend. So this is the show

01:38:01.140 --> 01:38:04.420
that's going to have to hold you over for two weeks. But the good news is I just said it's

01:38:04.420 --> 01:38:09.780
episode 517. So if you're newer to the show, you have a whole archive of shows you can go listen

01:38:09.780 --> 01:38:13.300
to if you don't mind hearing some old news, but there's always like a different classic game of

01:38:13.300 --> 01:38:18.980
the week and you know, whatever controversies are going on. So, uh, uh, I believe we have episodes

01:38:18.980 --> 01:38:24.580
dating back four years still on the same server. I mean, you can't, you can't easily get episode

01:38:24.580 --> 01:38:29.220
one or things like that. I mean, it was a very different show back in the day then too. I think,

01:38:29.220 --> 01:38:34.580
well, there is the OL archive, which is available on there, but, uh, I would say about the last four

01:38:34.580 --> 01:38:38.660
or five years worth of show is still on the Orange Lounge Radio.com server. So all you need are links,

01:38:38.660 --> 01:38:44.180
which are floating around out there. Uh, you can check that out. Uh, I do want to say hello to

01:38:44.180 --> 01:38:49.940
Dark Sakura, uh, because, uh, she had to leave the show, as you know, in part A, uh, she unfortunately

01:38:49.940 --> 01:38:54.580
got a little bit sick here on air, but she made it home during the break and she is in our chat room.

01:38:54.580 --> 01:38:58.420
So for the live listeners, you will at least get to say hi to Dark Sakura. She's there in the chat

01:38:58.420 --> 01:39:03.140
room and, uh, she does have her village open in Animal Crossing. If you want to go say hello to

01:39:03.140 --> 01:39:07.460
her and, uh, hit her with a bug net. That's, you just have to beat the allergies out of her with

01:39:07.460 --> 01:39:12.900
a bug net. So Misty, if you're available, the only way you need to, it's really the only way. All

01:39:12.900 --> 01:39:17.940
right. Um, so we are here to talk more news and get to the mailbag and all that fun stuff.

01:39:17.940 --> 01:39:23.060
Uh, let's do that right now with some rapid fire news. Loki. All right. So this was kind of a

01:39:23.060 --> 01:39:29.700
surprise announcement out of the whole PlayStation for, uh, uh, their press conference that they had.

01:39:29.700 --> 01:39:37.860
It was a reimagining of a game called Shadow of the Beast, which was an old, uh, side scroller,

01:39:37.860 --> 01:39:43.780
I guess, for the Amiga. You know, I know that game. And so now it's this like at first glance,

01:39:43.780 --> 01:39:49.540
you kind of go, oh, it's like Altered Beast, although no, but close enough, I guess. Yes.

01:39:49.540 --> 01:39:57.060
And now it's coming to the PlayStation four. So that's interesting, I guess. Definitely not

01:39:57.060 --> 01:40:03.540
something you would, you would guess would be coming. Um, game dev Tycoon is coming to steam

01:40:04.100 --> 01:40:10.740
this, um, this week, actually, August 29th, and it will be getting an HD, well, sort of an HD,

01:40:10.740 --> 01:40:15.940
a high res treatment. And if you haven't played game dev story, it was a game on the iOS

01:40:15.940 --> 01:40:23.140
platform. Fantastic. You run a game development company and you make games and you make consoles

01:40:23.140 --> 01:40:31.140
and it's just, it's one of those like kind of management Sims. It's a lot of fun. So, um,

01:40:31.220 --> 01:40:37.620
check it out. Um, I'm sorry, I'm getting, um, that confused the game dev story. I'm sorry,

01:40:37.620 --> 01:40:42.180
game dev Tycoon was the one that they offered up out there. Unfortunately, there was a couple of

01:40:42.180 --> 01:40:45.460
them. There's a couple. I'm sorry. That was the one that I took a look at that first thing. They

01:40:45.460 --> 01:40:50.740
were like, wait a second. That's the one they put up on Pirate Bay or whatever. Yeah, that's right.

01:40:50.740 --> 01:40:55.540
Ironically, your company would go on, you couldn't win because your company would always go bankrupt

01:40:55.540 --> 01:41:00.340
due to piracy and it was. Yeah, that's right. Nevermind. I'm sorry. But yeah, this game is

01:41:00.340 --> 01:41:04.900
coming out, but you should go play game dev story if you haven't yet. And that's fantastic. It's

01:41:04.900 --> 01:41:10.180
actually on, um, iOS and stuff. So you can check that out. Um, and if you want game dev story,

01:41:10.180 --> 01:41:14.500
I guess. I don't know. I have to do that kind of move that they, you know, they're trying to

01:41:14.500 --> 01:41:19.860
teach people a lesson. I think I'll teach them a lesson by not buying the game. Come on. It was

01:41:19.860 --> 01:41:32.100
funny. I'm just not interested in it. And then I mean, come on. Uh, so Eurogamer, um,

01:41:32.100 --> 01:41:39.540
kind of asked the question because it does beg to be asked, um, since, you know, last year and

01:41:40.420 --> 01:41:48.500
wasn't very good because FIFA 13 on Vita and on the Wii was a reskin of FIFA 12.

01:41:49.300 --> 01:41:56.900
So it begs the question, Hey guys, yay. Are you going to be putting out an actual

01:41:57.460 --> 01:42:03.860
sequel to the game? Are you going to just reskin, you know, the game from last year? And so

01:42:04.580 --> 01:42:12.660
EA sports came out with the best press or, you know, doctored press announcement ever. It was

01:42:12.660 --> 01:42:19.780
FIFA 14, uh, for VITA has the same great gameplay compared to last year's entry. It's,

01:42:19.780 --> 01:42:27.220
it's the same great gameplay and obviously with, um, any new kits. So basically it's the game that

01:42:27.220 --> 01:42:32.740
it was last year, but they've reskinned it and added whatever team roster updates that they're

01:42:32.740 --> 01:42:42.420
going to do. So literally roster update 2014 FIFA 14 is FIFA 13, which was FIFA 12. So fantastic that

01:42:43.300 --> 01:42:49.300
the game has not changed as people would hope. You don't have to worry about that happening on

01:42:49.300 --> 01:42:52.340
the Wii version or Wii U version because guess what? It's not coming out. They didn't make a

01:42:52.340 --> 01:42:57.220
version for the Wii or Wii U. And same with Pro Evolution. Now, now to be fair, Pro Evolution

01:42:57.220 --> 01:43:01.620
Soccer, same damn thing. They did that on the Wii. We do know that this year though, that is not the

01:43:01.620 --> 01:43:05.460
case, at least with PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions, since those are using the Fox engine

01:43:05.460 --> 01:43:10.500
now and everything. So, and I think it actually, uh, the FIFA is using their new engine, the

01:43:10.500 --> 01:43:16.740
Ignite engine. So yeah. Uh, go to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com. Bobby Blackwolf,

01:43:16.740 --> 01:43:22.020
having played both game dev games, wants you to know game dev tycoon is a lot deeper than game dev

01:43:22.020 --> 01:43:27.460
story. Uh, a lot more difficult. Uh, Blackwolf also is telling other chatters that he's going

01:43:27.460 --> 01:43:32.900
to make podcast network tycoon where you create a podcast network and have to deal with certain

01:43:32.900 --> 01:43:39.940
listeners. I think you should make that game. It'll be a lot of fun. That's the next thing

01:43:39.940 --> 01:43:43.860
VOG needs to get into game development because you don't do enough programming, Bobby. Let's

01:43:43.860 --> 01:43:50.100
take on another project. Come on. Love it. All right. Um, let's move on to some more

01:43:50.100 --> 01:43:55.380
rapid fire news. Uh, I'll do a couple stories here. One of them about Retro City Rampage on

01:43:55.380 --> 01:44:00.020
the 3DS. I think we've talked before it is coming. Uh, they're actually going to have it playable at

01:44:00.020 --> 01:44:03.780
PAX Prime, but this is interesting. You're not actually going to be able to play it in 3D at

01:44:03.780 --> 01:44:10.740
PAX Prime. So, okay. Uh, however, uh, this will be the latest version of Retro City Rampage that

01:44:10.740 --> 01:44:16.820
has the retro plus graphics mode that will double onscreen colors and add soft shadows to the game.

01:44:16.820 --> 01:44:22.820
Uh, it is coming out on the 3DS eShop. So yeah. Is it going to be in 3D or is it just not the 3D?

01:44:22.820 --> 01:44:27.540
I think the 3D version is not actually playable at PAX. That's what I'm gathering. But yeah,

01:44:27.540 --> 01:44:31.220
it sounds like it will be in 3D, but I would imagine it's going to be pretty limited. I mean,

01:44:31.220 --> 01:44:35.700
when you see the retro games in 3D, it's usually like one layer is this way and one layer. I

01:44:35.700 --> 01:44:41.620
wouldn't expect, but who knows? You might, it might exceed those expectations. Remember,

01:44:41.620 --> 01:44:48.100
this is all one guy making this too. That's very impressive. Yeah. Uh, more information for Super

01:44:48.100 --> 01:44:54.420
Smash Brothers, whatever the new one might be called on the 3DS and the Wii U. Uh, a new

01:44:54.420 --> 01:44:59.860
screenshot has revealed that there will be a stage based off of Metroid Other M. It's the pyrosphere

01:44:59.860 --> 01:45:03.540
from Metroid Other M, which is a pleasant surprise because, you know, I know a lot of us

01:45:03.540 --> 01:45:09.140
love Metroid. Metroid Other M on the other hand was a little more divisive, but, uh, I'm glad to

01:45:09.140 --> 01:45:13.940
see that they are having a nod to this game, even though it wasn't as well received as other classic

01:45:13.940 --> 01:45:18.180
games in the Metroid franchise. So that will be a stage available in the game based on a screenshot

01:45:18.180 --> 01:45:23.620
that's out there showing Samus and Bowser doing battle while lava is shooting out of the

01:45:23.620 --> 01:45:27.860
background. As expected in a Smash Brothers game, the backgrounds will fuck with you.

01:45:28.820 --> 01:45:35.220
Also of note for Smash Brothers, Masahiro Sakurai has noted that in the 3DS version

01:45:35.220 --> 01:45:40.900
of Smash Brothers, you can actually have outlines around the characters. And I believe this is to

01:45:40.900 --> 01:45:45.860
help them stand out on the smaller screen. However, you don't have to do it. The mention

01:45:45.860 --> 01:45:50.740
was that you can have thick outlines, thin outlines, or just turn them off.

01:45:52.260 --> 01:45:57.220
Fans very interested in these when the pictures first came out. The lines are there to help you

01:45:57.220 --> 01:46:02.820
see playable characters from the backgrounds and I would assume the various Pokemon that will show

01:46:02.820 --> 01:46:07.620
up and the other assists that happen in the fight. It can get a little crazy on that tiny screen.

01:46:07.620 --> 01:46:14.340
So, uh, I think that's great news. And I love, I love it when a developer, the more power they

01:46:14.340 --> 01:46:18.980
put in the hands of the player, I mean not to, you know, use an old game cliche, but the more

01:46:18.980 --> 01:46:23.540
customization that the player has to really make the game they want, I say the better. Instead of

01:46:23.540 --> 01:46:26.260
saying, we're going to do this, we're going to put outlines and that's the way it's going to be.

01:46:26.260 --> 01:46:32.180
Deal with it. So yeah, love that. Uh, a brand new expansion revealed for Diablo 3. We talked

01:46:32.180 --> 01:46:36.660
about earlier in the show, Diablo 3. Well, an expansion has been announced. It's called Reaper

01:46:36.660 --> 01:46:42.740
of Souls. Uh, it will have a new act in the game, five new levels and the Crusader class. It's a

01:46:42.740 --> 01:46:48.900
Holy Knight, very similar to the Paladin in Diablo 2. Uh, also the loot system being overhauled.

01:46:48.900 --> 01:46:53.460
They're going to call that loot 2.0. It has something called smart drop, meaning the items

01:46:53.460 --> 01:46:57.620
that you get will actually be something your class can use. Although there will still be the

01:46:57.620 --> 01:47:03.780
other classes because the idea is you trade and you have separate characters and so forth. Um,

01:47:03.780 --> 01:47:09.460
also there's something called, uh, loot runs where you get a fully randomized dungeon with randomized

01:47:09.460 --> 01:47:14.580
monsters and, uh, you kill lots of monsters and get lots of loot. Uh, Paragon system getting some

01:47:14.580 --> 01:47:20.900
changes. No Paragon level cap in the Diablo 3 expansion. So there you go. No release date as

01:47:20.900 --> 01:47:26.340
of yet, but Blizzcon is not that far away and I bet they'll have more to say at that time.

01:47:26.340 --> 01:47:30.180
In the meantime, they're focusing a little more on the console versions of Diablo 3.

01:47:31.940 --> 01:47:36.660
All right. Um, so few announcements. Uh, once again, this is going back to some of the Sony

01:47:36.660 --> 01:47:40.660
stuff. Uh, Gran Turismo 6 is now coming out on December 6th, you know, so it's easy for you to

01:47:40.660 --> 01:47:47.940
remember. And that would be on PlayStation 3 and they're going to have the most cars on disc of any

01:47:48.900 --> 01:47:54.900
Gran Turismo game yet. And, uh, I guess if you pre-order it some places like the Evil G,

01:47:54.900 --> 01:48:00.420
you may get some additional cars. And, uh, what I thought was interesting though,

01:48:00.420 --> 01:48:05.300
they actually showed like a little bit of a trailer and stuff is that car companies are

01:48:05.300 --> 01:48:13.140
developing, uh, prototype cars in Gran Turismo 6. Like they're making some of their prototypes

01:48:13.140 --> 01:48:18.180
available to play as I thought that was kind of cool. I'm not really a heck of a sign of the

01:48:18.180 --> 01:48:22.820
times. I'm not interested at all in Gran Turismo 6 because, you know, driving simulator, I'm just

01:48:22.820 --> 01:48:28.500
terrible at arcade fine, but arcade fine, but yeah, I'm the exact same way. Like Mario, Mario

01:48:28.500 --> 01:48:34.580
cart loved it. Blur was a great game. Here's something I would love Sony to do. Give me a

01:48:34.580 --> 01:48:42.020
Forza Horizon version of Gran Turismo would be fantastic. Forza Horizon was really good.

01:48:42.820 --> 01:48:46.020
You know, you give me something like that. Maybe that's what drive, no actually drive clubs,

01:48:46.020 --> 01:48:50.820
I think a bit worse. I don't know what drive club is. I don't know what drive club is either.

01:48:50.820 --> 01:48:55.140
I mean, uh, so I don't know if it's more simulation or more arcadey, but like give me an

01:48:55.140 --> 01:49:02.820
arcade version kind of Gran Turismo 6 and that'd be pretty sweet. But anyways, yeah. Um, so that's

01:49:02.820 --> 01:49:10.820
coming December 6. So far I might add the only game announced for December so far. Hmm. I still

01:49:10.820 --> 01:49:16.580
think, I think Ubisoft is going to move South Park there and put in the Far Cry 3. Well, it's just

01:49:16.580 --> 01:49:20.740
my own thought because last year the Far Cry 3 and it worked out really well for them. I thought

01:49:20.740 --> 01:49:25.060
they pushed the South Park game back to next year. They did. They kind of hinted that that could be

01:49:25.060 --> 01:49:30.420
a possibility because Matt Stone and Trey Parker kind of work on it on their own pace. Um, and

01:49:30.420 --> 01:49:36.820
you're not going to get them to hurry up. So it's when it's done, I guess. Fair enough. Um, all

01:49:36.820 --> 01:49:43.140
right. And then, uh, Pokemon X and Y, uh, the soundtrack will be coming out and it's coming on

01:49:43.140 --> 01:49:48.820
four discs. That's a lot of tracks, 212 tracks to be exact, three and a half hours of music.

01:49:49.540 --> 01:49:59.940
And it's available, I guess, um, on CD Japan for 2,500 yen. And, um, so yeah, that's, uh, not bad.

01:50:01.300 --> 01:50:09.540
And then of course, ah, there, um, hasn't really been any good Capcom fighting games,

01:50:09.540 --> 01:50:17.220
or I should say Street Fighter games on the Wii U. And, um, you know, Capcom's, oh no,

01:50:17.220 --> 01:50:23.540
they're basically saying, nope, no Street Fighter on the Wii U. Um, they just, no plans to bring any

01:50:23.540 --> 01:50:30.980
of the games, no plans for Ultra to come there. Um, so, uh, maybe Street Fighter 5, no idea.

01:50:30.980 --> 01:50:37.060
However, there will be, um, some eShop versions of Street Fighter coming to the Wii U. Street

01:50:37.060 --> 01:50:41.540
Fighter 2, they're coming out with, well, Street Fighter 2, Street Fighter 2 Turbo,

01:50:41.540 --> 01:50:48.980
Super Street Fighter 2 will be out on, um, Virtual Console. So those are going to be $7.99 each.

01:50:49.860 --> 01:50:54.340
If you miss your fighting game that only has eight playable characters,

01:50:55.540 --> 01:50:58.740
at least you know this one's solid. Classic Street Fighter.

01:50:58.740 --> 01:51:01.300
Yeah. Did they ever put out Killer Instinct on, uh...

01:51:02.180 --> 01:51:05.780
I don't believe they did. But you know what I have sitting right over there?

01:51:05.780 --> 01:51:09.460
A Super Nintendo. And you see that black cartridge lying on top of that?

01:51:09.460 --> 01:51:12.660
That can only be one thing. So I'm not too worried.

01:51:14.660 --> 01:51:18.340
All right, I gotta thank Alan for that, though. That's his Killer Instinct cartridge, not mine.

01:51:18.340 --> 01:51:24.020
All right. All right, uh, let's get to, uh, the FUGL question of the week. You take Facebook,

01:51:24.020 --> 01:51:26.100
you take Google, slam them together, you get FUGL.

01:51:33.540 --> 01:51:36.580
Every week we ask a question of our Facebook community at facebook.com

01:51:36.580 --> 01:51:41.220
slash Orange Lounge Radio and our Google Plus page over at plus.google.com slash

01:51:41.220 --> 01:51:44.180
one one zero. No, I'm kidding. Just search for Orange Lounge Radio.

01:51:44.180 --> 01:51:48.100
All right, uh, very simple question this week because most of the news this week,

01:51:48.180 --> 01:51:53.220
most of the heavy-hitting news was centered around Sony's big press conference. We know the date.

01:51:53.220 --> 01:51:57.780
We know the details. We pretty much know all there is to know about PlayStation 4's

01:51:57.780 --> 01:52:00.900
launch at this point. Maybe a few surprises at a Tokyo game show.

01:52:01.380 --> 01:52:05.460
Um, so what's the verdict? I figure most people have made up their mind.

01:52:05.460 --> 01:52:10.340
What's the verdict on the PlayStation 4? Are you getting one? Why or why not?

01:52:10.900 --> 01:52:14.500
Let's start with an answer on Google Plus from Jamie Mon, who says,

01:52:14.500 --> 01:52:18.500
I was already sold on the PlayStation 4, but the fact that they came out of the box

01:52:18.500 --> 01:52:22.100
with no shady online requirements and it's cheaper was a plus.

01:52:22.660 --> 01:52:26.980
What they revealed this week wasn't anything to write home about, but didn't sway my opinion

01:52:26.980 --> 01:52:33.780
either way. That being said, I plan on buying both systems at launch. Lucky guy. Lucky guy.

01:52:34.420 --> 01:52:41.300
Uh, Black Dynamite says, getting one absolutely day one, no way. Using the show's golden rule,

01:52:41.300 --> 01:52:45.860
a console is only as good as the games that are on it applies here. Any worthwhile game,

01:52:45.860 --> 01:52:49.860
Grand Theft Auto 5, Call of Duty, Final Fantasy, et cetera, are coming out for current gen.

01:52:49.860 --> 01:52:53.220
There's no real reason to get one unless you just want the latest and greatest,

01:52:53.220 --> 01:52:56.580
which I believe is an answer that echoes where Loki's head is at right now, right?

01:52:59.060 --> 01:53:05.460
I still probably will get one, but I, uh, Grand Theft Auto, man, that's, we'll see.

01:53:05.460 --> 01:53:10.660
That's kind of where I'm at because I'm like, I still want one. And the gamer that has to

01:53:10.660 --> 01:53:16.100
have all the new toys wants one, even just, and yes, I know the game. I love that you

01:53:16.100 --> 01:53:22.340
invoked the golden rule of gaming and there's no games I'm dying for at launch, but I kind of want

01:53:22.340 --> 01:53:31.860
that console still. To buy Grand Theft Auto 5. Seriously, you just need to do that. I will,

01:53:31.860 --> 01:53:36.660
let me know what system Bobby's getting it on because at least I know I'm going to play against

01:53:36.660 --> 01:53:41.620
you and get killed, but I can play against Bobby and we're about, you don't play against me. We're

01:53:41.620 --> 01:53:46.900
in a crew. We go, we go do heists. Oh, okay. So it's like mass effect. We get a fog crew together

01:53:46.900 --> 01:53:52.100
and we do heists. So it's just like mass effect. No, but mass effect is lame. I'm sorry. You're

01:53:52.100 --> 01:53:56.900
supposed to say yes, because that gets me to buy it. All right, fine. Yes. It's like mass effect.

01:53:56.900 --> 01:54:02.180
All right. Act F says I'm going to wait to see where the consoles go and what games really do

01:54:02.260 --> 01:54:08.420
interest me on consoles. For now, I'll stick to my PC and my 3DS. Redertainment says no,

01:54:09.220 --> 01:54:13.700
not because I don't want one, but because project buy a house takes priority. Well, real life

01:54:13.700 --> 01:54:19.380
sometimes does. Tech EQ says yes, I will get a PlayStation 4 at launch. I need to trade in my 360

01:54:19.380 --> 01:54:23.860
because it's gathering dust because I'm using my PS3 as my main console for gaming and video

01:54:23.860 --> 01:54:29.700
streaming. The Evil G was offering 50% more in-store credit towards the PlayStation 4 in June.

01:54:30.420 --> 01:54:33.780
Oh boy, all these incentives that Evil G is going to throw out there.

01:54:33.780 --> 01:54:38.660
Just, I'm just going to throw this out there as a word of advice. Make sure you can't get a better

01:54:38.660 --> 01:54:44.020
deal selling the thing directly if you're up for doing that. That's all I'm saying. That's all I'm

01:54:44.020 --> 01:54:48.100
saying. Or if you're going to try to trade up, maybe, I mean, if you're going to be that hardcore

01:54:48.100 --> 01:54:54.900
and buy the game on both platforms, maybe just show yourself a little restraint and not play the

01:54:54.900 --> 01:54:58.820
game for a couple of weeks and just get it when it comes out on that platform. Because let's be

01:54:58.820 --> 01:55:01.780
honest, there's a lot of stuff coming out in the fourth quarter and you don't need to buy

01:55:01.780 --> 01:55:08.660
everything right away. SSJ100Matt in chat says Grand Theft Auto 5 VOD game nights will be great.

01:55:08.660 --> 01:55:13.140
Yep. Yep. That is definitely going to happen. And you're going to be able to stream them, I hope.

01:55:13.140 --> 01:55:18.740
Uh, I will. And then DarkSakura is in chat letting us still know her opinion. She says,

01:55:18.740 --> 01:55:24.340
I've revised my rule. I have a new golden rule. Never buy a game system or an Apple product at

01:55:24.340 --> 01:55:31.060
launch. You're no fun. No fun at all. All right, let's go to Facebook. Those are all our answers

01:55:31.060 --> 01:55:36.260
from Google Plus. Let's do Facebook. Holy moly, 18 comments on Facebook. I'm going to try to do

01:55:36.260 --> 01:55:40.820
this relatively quick. I apologize in advance. I may not read all of these. I'm going to try to

01:55:40.820 --> 01:55:46.660
pick out people I don't usually see. Kertie K says, I won't be getting one this year. I'm not

01:55:46.660 --> 01:55:50.820
looking forward to any of the launch titles so I can wait until at least next year to pick up one.

01:55:51.700 --> 01:55:56.740
Burr says, I'm getting one but that's because I'm a consumer whore who has pre-ordered both systems.

01:55:56.740 --> 01:56:01.380
However, I feel confident that the PlayStation 4 will be worth it just for whatever Naughty Dog

01:56:01.380 --> 01:56:07.860
develops for it. Uh, Doug T says, I will be buying the PlayStation 4 day one. I love my PlayStation 3

01:56:07.860 --> 01:56:12.020
and PlayStation Vita. I like Sony consoles better as they bring out more games that I like such as

01:56:12.020 --> 01:56:18.100
RPGs. Brian G says, I will wait until there's a compelling reason for me to buy one. I have a

01:56:18.100 --> 01:56:24.180
gaming PC and like Loki, Grand Theft Auto will keep me busy for a long time. Locopoco says,

01:56:24.180 --> 01:56:29.380
I'll be getting one day one. Excited for Knack and Killzone also because I'm a consumer whore.

01:56:31.540 --> 01:56:36.420
Renee, one of our buddies from Koopa Club says, I will not be getting a PS4 this year. Not because

01:56:36.420 --> 01:56:40.420
I don't want it but because I'm not ready to make that monetary investment just yet.

01:56:41.300 --> 01:56:45.620
Jeremy Jay also from Koopa Club says, I've pre-ordered my bundle with Watch Dogs.

01:56:45.620 --> 01:56:50.260
I'm buying it because of Final Fantasy 15 much like I bought the PlayStation 3 originally for

01:56:50.260 --> 01:56:56.900
Final Fantasy 13. Eddie K sounds like he's signing up for the Dark Sakura's new rule

01:56:56.900 --> 01:57:02.260
saying, I generally never get a system at launch. I usually wait about 18 months because by that

01:57:02.260 --> 01:57:06.500
time they've worked out most of the bugs in the system. There's a decent selection of titles you

01:57:06.500 --> 01:57:12.660
actually want and by that time is usually when they do their first price drop. And uh, let's see,

01:57:12.660 --> 01:57:18.100
a couple last answers here. Hitstun says, slow down. I don't even have a PlayStation 3 yet.

01:57:18.100 --> 01:57:23.460
I still want to play Journey, Valkyria Chronicles and Tokyo Jungle. PlayStation 4 just doesn't have

01:57:23.460 --> 01:57:29.220
any games I could get hyped about. And lastly, Codeman says, I cancelled my pre-order. I have

01:57:29.220 --> 01:57:34.020
a PC but I just don't have the funds nor do I really need one right now. The only reason

01:57:34.020 --> 01:57:38.660
are games that have sold this to me as Kingdom Hearts 3 and Final Fantasy 15. Although they are

01:57:38.660 --> 01:57:44.020
developing Kingdom Hearts 3 on PC so there might be a PC build. I will wait just to let the dust

01:57:44.020 --> 01:57:50.180
settle. And tacos. Some of the answers there from Facebook. I apologize I didn't read them all

01:57:50.180 --> 01:57:54.500
just because there were so many answers. But I do encourage our listeners to check out the variety

01:57:54.500 --> 01:58:00.820
of answers available on Facebook. Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio. And I did read them

01:58:00.820 --> 01:58:04.660
all on Google tonight because there's just less people over there. But you can check out the full

01:58:04.660 --> 01:58:07.700
answers. I did truncate some of the answers a little bit. You can check that out on our

01:58:07.780 --> 01:58:14.020
Google Plus page. Thank you to everybody for responding. Let's get back into some more news.

01:58:14.020 --> 01:58:22.900
Loki. Alright. So let's talk a little bit about the Xbox One. Europe. They made an announcement

01:58:22.900 --> 01:58:28.420
that, hey, we're gonna get you to buy the Xbox One because we know what you Europeans like.

01:58:28.420 --> 01:58:33.620
You like FIFA. So you get FIFA. You get FIFA. You get FIFA. You get FIFA. You get FIFA. Everybody

01:58:33.620 --> 01:58:42.500
gets FIFA 14 with the Xbox One and and the soundtracks by Adele. Go figure to try and

01:58:42.500 --> 01:58:54.660
get more sales. It's a joke. Yeah, I got that. So, yes, it will be also available on Xbox 360.

01:58:54.660 --> 01:59:05.460
You can get a bundle as well for 199 Euro. So, yeah. So FIFA. FIFA 14. That's how they're

01:59:05.460 --> 01:59:13.300
gonna sell it to you. Cool. It's interesting that it's a third party game. That's the part

01:59:13.300 --> 01:59:17.060
that gets me like I'm like, wow, it's a third party. I mean, it really does sweeten the deal,

01:59:17.060 --> 01:59:20.900
though. I mean, with the fact that the console's, you know, $100 more expensive,

01:59:21.620 --> 01:59:27.300
it goes a long way to put a game in there to give that extra value. I realize the game is only 60

01:59:27.300 --> 01:59:30.740
bucks. But remember, connect and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Whether you like it or not,

01:59:30.740 --> 01:59:35.860
that is all stuff that's coming with it, which FIFA 14 does not. I don't believe uses connect.

01:59:35.860 --> 01:59:39.620
Well, well, I don't know if it uses connect because they don't say anymore. A lot of the

01:59:39.620 --> 01:59:44.900
Xbox One games aren't right away. Let's be there. There's some. But, you know, there's a lot that

01:59:44.900 --> 01:59:51.140
aren't. At least if what we saw at E3 is to be any. I mean, they use it on the 360. Let's assume

01:59:51.140 --> 01:59:55.540
that the features for the connect are going to be pretty similar on the Xbox One as they are on the

01:59:55.540 --> 02:00:02.340
Xbox 360. So the advantage that you get with the Xbox One is you paid $100 more for that stupid

02:00:02.900 --> 02:00:08.900
camera and they're going to penalize you for swearing at the game. So count me in.

02:00:10.100 --> 02:00:13.380
Yeah, that's not going to work in my house. Like just just the other night,

02:00:13.380 --> 02:00:17.700
actually one game I've been playing a lot of this week, Bit.Trip Runner 2.

02:00:17.700 --> 02:00:20.580
I didn't talk about this in my gaming week. Oh, yeah, that's free, isn't it?

02:00:20.580 --> 02:00:25.460
It's free on PlayStation Plus. I bought it months ago on Wii U, but I was like,

02:00:25.460 --> 02:00:30.260
well, shit, it's free and I want trophies. So I'm going to play it again. And every time I'm

02:00:30.260 --> 02:00:39.780
playing that game, doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo. Fuck! God damn it! All the way back to the

02:00:39.780 --> 02:00:46.100
beginning of the level. Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo. God! That's me playing Bit.Trip.

02:00:46.820 --> 02:00:54.260
So I don't need the connect penalizing me further for swearing. Although I think a lot of that is

02:00:54.260 --> 02:00:59.300
obviously overdone. Come on. What connect games are really going to penalize you for swearing

02:00:59.300 --> 02:01:02.180
unless it's like Sesame Street adventures? They're going to throw. Yeah, they're going to

02:01:02.180 --> 02:01:08.740
card you in the game or flag you, I guess. Yeah, I don't know. It seems kind of lame

02:01:08.740 --> 02:01:13.540
that they have that as an option. And that's that's the best you could come up with for

02:01:13.540 --> 02:01:18.740
connect is that a lot of stuff. Yeah, that doesn't make any sense to me. Well, in Europe,

02:01:18.740 --> 02:01:22.660
that's a huge deal. That's like Mario Brothers. No, I'm not knocking that. You know, they're

02:01:22.660 --> 02:01:27.140
bringing in. That's a big thing for I'm talking about connect. Like what they're using it for is

02:01:27.140 --> 02:01:31.540
just like a lot of this voice recognition stuff that I think you could probably do just fine with

02:01:32.180 --> 02:01:37.780
a headset. So I don't understand why they need a whole thing to watch you

02:01:39.700 --> 02:01:46.820
to do this, you know, voice stuff. All right. Well, some other big Microsoft news this week.

02:01:46.820 --> 02:01:51.540
I'm sure many of you have heard that the current CEO of Microsoft, Steve Ballmer,

02:01:51.540 --> 02:01:58.660
no, Bill Gates is not CEO. It's actually Steve Ballmer is the Microsoft CEO. He will be retiring

02:01:58.660 --> 02:02:03.540
from that position over the next 12 months. Don't know exactly when I would imagine a lot of that

02:02:03.540 --> 02:02:09.380
depends on when they figure out who is going to be replacing him and how well the Xbox one does.

02:02:10.340 --> 02:02:14.580
I don't know about retirement. The problem is people were already criticizing Steve Ballmer

02:02:14.580 --> 02:02:19.860
and it's not necessarily related to the Xbox one because like you said, I'm not out yet. Windows 8.

02:02:20.580 --> 02:02:26.580
It's that in the tablets. Windows surface. Yeah, the tablets, the phones, they haven't really been

02:02:26.580 --> 02:02:30.740
doing as well as they should have been. So yeah, unfortunately you get a lot of that stuff and

02:02:31.780 --> 02:02:37.220
the stockholders are saying maybe it's time for somebody else. There is a panel put together to

02:02:37.220 --> 02:02:44.180
try and find a replacement. Now the panel includes Bill Gates, Chuck Noski, Steven Luxo also on that

02:02:44.180 --> 02:02:49.380
panel. So yeah, if you're interested, just give Bill Gates a call and let them know you're

02:02:49.380 --> 02:02:53.380
interested in the position. Although I kind of think they'll probably be looking, you know, at

02:02:53.380 --> 02:03:00.340
other big companies, tech companies. Here's where I insert my fan wank that they should hire Reggie

02:03:00.340 --> 02:03:08.980
Fils-Aime. Come on guys. How do you like that fan wank? No, we're talking about, for one, Reggie's

02:03:08.980 --> 02:03:14.020
obviously a very game focused company. When we talk about the Microsoft CEO, that is much more

02:03:14.020 --> 02:03:21.220
than just Xbox. Maybe they'll promote from within. Kind of like how, you know, what they did when

02:03:21.220 --> 02:03:26.980
Don Mattrick left. You know what they need to do. And I know that this would probably violate some

02:03:26.980 --> 02:03:31.700
contracts and stuff, but they need to hire fictional character Kevin Butler

02:03:33.220 --> 02:03:36.740
as president of Microsoft because it would be awesome.

02:03:39.460 --> 02:03:46.180
Is there anybody that jumps out at you who could be the person to jump in as CEO?

02:03:47.140 --> 02:03:47.620
No.

02:03:48.580 --> 02:03:50.020
Well, you know what they, you know what else they could-

02:03:50.020 --> 02:03:50.500
Clippy.

02:03:51.540 --> 02:03:52.100
Clippy B.

02:03:53.380 --> 02:03:59.140
Oh, Clippy, the Microsoft office assistant. Yes. Well, you know what they could do in

02:03:59.140 --> 02:04:05.780
good old American tradition to find the new CEO of Microsoft? Reality TV show.

02:04:08.980 --> 02:04:13.380
This is Microsoft's Idol. America voted.

02:04:16.660 --> 02:04:19.300
Anyhow, another show for Seacrest to host. Come on.

02:04:20.260 --> 02:04:21.060
He doesn't need work.

02:04:21.940 --> 02:04:27.060
No, he's going to be hosting an NBC game show coming up. The million second quiz,

02:04:27.060 --> 02:04:31.140
which is, and I know, God, I can't believe I'm going to admit this. There's an app that's

02:04:31.140 --> 02:04:32.420
available- That's a pretty long time.

02:04:32.420 --> 02:04:35.300
There's an app that's available. It's 11 days, a million seconds.

02:04:35.860 --> 02:04:37.460
Yeah, I know. That's a pretty long time.

02:04:37.460 --> 02:04:41.540
Well, they're trying to make it an event game show. Remember when Who Wants to Be a Millionaire

02:04:42.020 --> 02:04:46.340
I love game shows. So remember when Who Wants to Be a Millionaire first came out on ABC,

02:04:46.340 --> 02:04:52.500
it was a big fucking deal, right? The original Regis hosted one when the guy won the million

02:04:52.500 --> 02:04:57.060
dollars and used his lifeline to call his dad. Like that was like epic television, right?

02:04:57.060 --> 02:04:57.380
Yeah.

02:04:57.380 --> 02:05:00.420
There was event television. That's what NBC is trying to try to make that happen again.

02:05:00.420 --> 02:05:03.140
Cause it's been a while since we've really had, you know, Who Wants to Be a Millionaire

02:05:03.140 --> 02:05:07.700
has kind of faded away into a, I shouldn't say faded away because now it's like a syndicated

02:05:07.700 --> 02:05:10.660
game show, like your Jeopardy, like your Wheel of Fortune, you know, it's there.

02:05:10.660 --> 02:05:14.020
But NBC is trying to make this event game show happen again.

02:05:14.020 --> 02:05:18.020
And we've seen other networks try this. Like ABC had one a couple of years ago called Dual.

02:05:18.020 --> 02:05:20.580
It was a pretty decent game, but it just didn't really take off.

02:05:20.580 --> 02:05:24.900
Yeah. It really needs to be based off the Stephen King novel in order to like be interesting.

02:05:24.900 --> 02:05:28.180
Well, NBC has got this million second quiz and it's going to be hosted by Seacrest. Well,

02:05:28.180 --> 02:05:31.780
okay. Remember back in the day with Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, part of the reason everybody

02:05:31.780 --> 02:05:37.460
was so like crazy about it is because the way you entered was you could call a telephone line and

02:05:37.460 --> 02:05:41.620
play a game. And if you were good at the game, you might get flown to New York and go on the

02:05:41.620 --> 02:05:45.700
show. Right. And I think they had a thing at McDonald's too. I want to say it was many years

02:05:45.700 --> 02:05:52.020
ago. Yeah. Remember the telephone. Okay. Well now what was that? 1999. So here we are 14 years

02:05:52.020 --> 02:05:56.820
later. Now it's an iPad app. So you can actually download the million second quiz iPad app. And I'm

02:05:56.820 --> 02:06:02.100
maybe guilty of having played this, but you get matched up against other people and you take a

02:06:02.100 --> 02:06:07.060
10 question quiz. It's all multiple choice. And it's like a mixture of like the same thing you

02:06:07.060 --> 02:06:11.380
would expect to see on Trivial Pursuit cards. Right. And you have to pick the answer. Well,

02:06:11.380 --> 02:06:15.540
supposedly, and I don't know how this is going to work, but if you hit a certain benchmark score

02:06:15.540 --> 02:06:22.500
in the iPad app, you qualify as a line jumper to go beyond the real show when it debuts,

02:06:22.500 --> 02:06:27.700
I think in a week or two. I think it's coming up here pretty soon. All right. Good. Now when they

02:06:27.700 --> 02:06:32.980
say, Oh, you might, you might win money, like a million billion dollars or however much they're

02:06:32.980 --> 02:06:37.060
giving away a few thousand. I'm not, but I, but that's, that's how they get, that's how they make

02:06:37.060 --> 02:06:43.780
it event television by saying you Johnny America sitting at home with your iPad, get the app now,

02:06:43.780 --> 02:06:50.020
and you can be here sitting and winning all this money in a couple weeks or whatever. Pretty good

02:06:50.020 --> 02:06:57.140
idea. How did talking about Steve Ballmer leave us to talking about NBC game shows? I don't know,

02:06:57.140 --> 02:07:01.860
but I agree with code man in the chat room who says, at least it's not candy crush,

02:07:01.860 --> 02:07:05.780
true facts deleted that from my phone. Thank you very much. That was embarrassing. Sorry about

02:07:05.780 --> 02:07:12.100
that. I, I bet you anything. Yeah. There will be a candy crush theme game show at some point.

02:07:12.100 --> 02:07:16.900
Cause wasn't there like a Hasbro themed game show? Yes, there still is. There's still the family

02:07:16.900 --> 02:07:23.700
game night. Yes. Family game night. So act deft and chat says, imagine if Rob gets on that game

02:07:23.700 --> 02:07:28.740
show. Yes, please. But, uh, it would also be nice if I won some money because then like, you know,

02:07:28.740 --> 02:07:34.020
if I win enough money, I could possibly leave my day job and do vog full time. Wouldn't that be

02:07:34.020 --> 02:07:41.620
fun? If I could win a million dollars. Huh? All right. Forget it. Moving on more news.

02:07:42.180 --> 02:07:50.260
All right. So, uh, Humble Bundle, um, the Origin Bundle has earned a record breaking $8.7 million.

02:07:51.140 --> 02:08:01.780
And that was based on 1.791 million bundles, uh, being sold and, um, average price 486.

02:08:03.620 --> 02:08:12.740
And, uh, I guess the record previous to that was 5.1 million, um, with the Humble Indie Bundle 5.

02:08:14.260 --> 02:08:18.180
And, uh, they did add a few more games. They added command and conquer red alert,

02:08:18.180 --> 02:08:23.540
three uprising, not red alert three, which would have been an awesome game,

02:08:23.540 --> 02:08:29.460
but red alert three uprising, a four level ex standalone expansion. Boo.

02:08:30.340 --> 02:08:37.140
Act deft and check correcting you, by the way, it's over 9 million now. I don't want to, uh,

02:08:37.140 --> 02:08:46.180
populace and yes. And, um, I think that was it. Yeah. I love the fact, by the way,

02:08:46.180 --> 02:08:51.860
even though populace, you have to get it through origin, whatever it's, um, that's like the classic

02:08:51.860 --> 02:08:55.300
game back from like, when did that game come out? Like 1989. It was on super Nintendo.

02:08:55.940 --> 02:09:01.380
And, um, that game was awesome. Um, and I was very happy that they threw that in the bundle as well.

02:09:01.380 --> 02:09:06.260
And what's so funny about it is because the game is so old origin actually has these prompts that

02:09:06.260 --> 02:09:12.740
says, okay, you are about to play an old game. And back in the day, there was no way to quit

02:09:12.740 --> 02:09:16.580
an old game. So if you need to quit the game, you all tab when you all tab out of the game,

02:09:16.580 --> 02:09:20.180
you quit the game. Cause remember the old PC get, you just power off your PC to quit them.

02:09:20.180 --> 02:09:25.940
There was no like way to exit populace. There's no exit, not in populace. Well,

02:09:25.940 --> 02:09:31.780
they didn't program it very well then you can quit the DOS. I mean, DOS. And then also,

02:09:31.780 --> 02:09:37.060
this is the funny thing. Remember how games back in the day, the copy protection was the manual.

02:09:37.060 --> 02:09:41.780
What is the third word on page 45 of the manual or use this chart in the back of the man? So that

02:09:41.860 --> 02:09:46.420
was in populace. You had to identify these crests in the game. So that's still in there,

02:09:46.420 --> 02:09:51.700
but they fixed it so that it says you can input any word and the game will accept it as the

02:09:51.700 --> 02:09:57.300
correct answer. So like, what does this shield mean? Boobs. And it'll take it. That's correct.

02:09:59.780 --> 02:10:06.420
There you go. Yeah. All right. All right. And then, um, something else about origin.

02:10:06.900 --> 02:10:14.260
They're now allowing returns now returns with an asterisk. Basically what's going to happen is if

02:10:14.260 --> 02:10:22.340
you buy a game on origin and they have this now great game guarantee, if you're unsatisfied with

02:10:22.340 --> 02:10:28.580
your full game, a digital download from origin, and this includes full games on pre-order and,

02:10:28.580 --> 02:10:34.740
you know, other discounts and stuff, I believe you'll be able to return it within seven days.

02:10:36.580 --> 02:10:46.660
So seven days after purchase without activation or 24 hours after launching it for the first time.

02:10:46.660 --> 02:10:50.260
So 24 hours if you've activated seven days, if you haven't activated the game.

02:10:51.860 --> 02:10:58.020
Interesting to see origin and EA really making these big customer service grabs between the

02:10:58.020 --> 02:11:02.100
humble bundle and the great thing they're doing for charity. And I hate to make that

02:11:02.180 --> 02:11:07.700
sound opportunistic, but the reality is it's, it was opportunistic. Well, it's putting a lot of

02:11:07.700 --> 02:11:16.740
people in origins, good graces right now. And now this, which is hard to say this isn't good news.

02:11:16.740 --> 02:11:22.500
I think it's great. It isn't, it isn't terrible. It's not bad news. It's good news. Um, you know,

02:11:22.500 --> 02:11:28.820
it's, it's good that they have the option in there. Um, and it's good to like, you know,

02:11:28.820 --> 02:11:32.980
for a few reasons. One, if you run into a situation like SIM city where the whole launch

02:11:32.980 --> 02:11:38.180
was fucked up, you know, you can get your money back, which is kind of cool. Or for example,

02:11:38.180 --> 02:11:44.180
like if you buy a game that just doesn't run well on your PC, then you can get your money back.

02:11:44.180 --> 02:11:48.660
So that's pretty good. Or you just don't like it. Yeah. Or you just don't like it. So I think

02:11:48.660 --> 02:11:52.660
that's kind of cool that they have that in there. I wish steam would do something similar, but it's,

02:11:52.660 --> 02:11:58.660
let's, let's be honest here. This is far and away from like, you know, I'm selling a used

02:11:58.660 --> 02:12:02.900
copy of my game that I finished or something like that. This is, this is not anything like that.

02:12:02.900 --> 02:12:09.380
This is just kind of like that. Oh, almost like the, the evil G use game thing where it's like,

02:12:09.380 --> 02:12:13.460
okay, within seven days you can return this, you know, except, you know, seven days without

02:12:13.460 --> 02:12:19.060
playing it. Um, so I'll give them props for at least having some sort of return.

02:12:20.020 --> 02:12:24.420
Well, you said in there in passing, you said, I wish steam would do something like this because

02:12:24.420 --> 02:12:26.820
yeah, they don't really do refunds on steam unless there's a huge, I mean,

02:12:26.820 --> 02:12:32.340
they've done it before, but it was like a huge thing. But, uh, this whole competition now,

02:12:32.340 --> 02:12:36.580
you know, if origin does get more and more market share, it's going to force steam to look into

02:12:36.580 --> 02:12:41.780
doing these types of things. Yeah. For, uh, you know, to, to make themselves competitive.

02:12:41.780 --> 02:12:44.900
It's interesting. I don't know if they'll have to do that because I think what's going to end

02:12:44.900 --> 02:12:49.460
up happening is they're probably going to come out with some sort of way to sell or trade your

02:12:49.460 --> 02:12:53.300
game online using their services. I think that's what's going to end up happening there. So they

02:12:53.300 --> 02:13:02.740
may not have like, you know, the whole returns thing. So I think this is a good direction. I

02:13:02.740 --> 02:13:06.900
mean, I can't say I'm going to go buy a bunch of games and then return them, but it does take that

02:13:06.900 --> 02:13:11.140
awkwardness out of returning things too. Like, I don't know. I just don't like to go back to the

02:13:11.140 --> 02:13:15.860
store and return something as I feel like that guy, unless it's like very clearly broken or

02:13:15.860 --> 02:13:22.660
whatever. Like I just, who likes to be that guy? Well, some people do, but anyway. Uh, well, you

02:13:22.660 --> 02:13:29.460
can be any guy or gal you want to be in a series known as Fable and Fable Legends is a new game.

02:13:30.260 --> 02:13:34.420
It's a multiplayer game that's set in the universe of the other Fable games, Albion.

02:13:35.060 --> 02:13:40.820
It was announced at Gamescom. There will be a beta test actually happening next year. So not

02:13:40.820 --> 02:13:48.420
to be outdone by say Elder Scrolls Online on the PlayStation. Xbox will have Fable Legends. No

02:13:48.420 --> 02:13:52.900
release window for the game currently, but I would imagine if they're going to beta test it next year,

02:13:52.900 --> 02:13:56.900
no later than holiday next year. Holiday next year would be my guess. You can sign up on the

02:13:56.900 --> 02:14:01.140
game's website if you're interested in more information, fablelegends.com. And there's

02:14:01.140 --> 02:14:03.940
like a little trailer and you can see all the other stuff they put out at Gamescom. It looked

02:14:03.940 --> 02:14:09.220
neat, but I'm sorry. After playing the last few Fable games, it's just, it's always so much hype

02:14:09.220 --> 02:14:14.100
and then they play, especially if they have Peter Molyneux talking about Fable. Oh my God.

02:14:14.660 --> 02:14:18.420
You know, they just hype it up so much and it's just kind of like, yeah, this is kind of very

02:14:18.420 --> 02:14:23.140
similar to the last Fable game. Um, so I don't know. It looks all right, but I mean, it'd be

02:14:23.140 --> 02:14:27.300
something my wife would be into. I'm not buying it. She loved the Fable games, didn't she? I'm

02:14:27.300 --> 02:14:31.700
not buying an Xbox one for that game, but you know, my wife would probably be interested.

02:14:31.700 --> 02:14:35.220
I forgot. She, she really liked the Fable games, huh? Yeah, she plays through. Cause she like,

02:14:35.620 --> 02:14:39.700
she liked to do really weird things in them, didn't she? Not really. I thought that's what,

02:14:39.700 --> 02:14:45.220
I thought that's what it was. No. Does she play them good or evil? Good. Usually she tries to.

02:14:45.220 --> 02:14:51.620
That's, that's good. All right. Well, let's see if our emailers this week are good or evil in

02:14:51.620 --> 02:14:58.580
a segment we do every week here on the show called the Mailbag. Mailbag at orangelaungerator.com is

02:14:58.580 --> 02:15:04.900
the place to send us emails each and every week. And, uh, in the absence of dark Sakura tonight,

02:15:04.900 --> 02:15:10.340
I will dive into the mailbag head first. Ooh. And, uh, oh my gosh, it's pretty empty in here,

02:15:10.980 --> 02:15:14.980
but at the very, very, very bottom of this mailbag, whoop, way down there at the bottom,

02:15:15.540 --> 02:15:20.820
one email here for me to read tonight. Yeah. One email. Well, you know what? It's kind of a long

02:15:20.820 --> 02:15:25.700
email, so it'll work. Uh, if you want to email us for a future week, you know what? When dark

02:15:25.700 --> 02:15:30.820
soccer gets back and she's over allergies and all that, let's make her work. Give us like 10 emails

02:15:30.820 --> 02:15:36.740
for next week. If you can send 10 emails from 10 different people, I will get dark Sakura a taco.

02:15:37.780 --> 02:15:42.660
Remember that bet. All right. Uh, Ragenator is our emailer tonight and here we go.

02:15:43.380 --> 02:15:48.180
Uh, I think that we all in the VoG community have at least one thing in common. We're all gamers.

02:15:49.620 --> 02:15:56.580
I'm gonna, I'm gonna actually stop you right there. VoG is actually the voice of Geeks Network.

02:15:56.580 --> 02:16:05.060
Now I think most of the people do play some games, but like not, well, certainly not every

02:16:05.060 --> 02:16:10.500
show on VoG is about games. Um, and we, I think we do have a couple hosts who maybe don't play

02:16:10.500 --> 02:16:15.220
nearly as many video games as the rest of us do. So please, please do make that a note, even though

02:16:15.220 --> 02:16:21.780
OLR, Bobby Black Wolf, Girls Gone Wow, you know, we're, we're all strictly about video games.

02:16:21.780 --> 02:16:27.220
Understation Live dabbles in it, Pod Culture dabbles in it. Uh, they are not strictly video

02:16:27.220 --> 02:16:33.380
games, but anyhow, I think you would be right in saying gaming is one big part of geek culture.

02:16:34.100 --> 02:16:39.540
Anyhow, he goes on to say, granted the reasons why we're gamers may be vastly different,

02:16:39.540 --> 02:16:43.860
but nonetheless, we're gamers. That being said, I'd like to pose this question to the three of

02:16:43.860 --> 02:16:50.500
you as well as the VoG community as a whole. Why gaming? What draws you to the hobby as opposed

02:16:50.500 --> 02:16:54.340
to some other hobby as opposed to something like, I don't know, underwater basket weaving?

02:16:54.900 --> 02:16:59.380
I'm positive that there has to be some sort of motivation behind it. Is it major or minor or

02:16:59.380 --> 02:17:05.540
people wouldn't do it? For me, my original reason from 1981 was the novelty of video games. Before I

02:17:05.540 --> 02:17:11.060
discovered video games, I could only turn a TV on or off, change the volume or change the channel.

02:17:11.060 --> 02:17:15.700
I could not have direct control of anything that actually happened on the screen. Video games

02:17:15.700 --> 02:17:20.340
changed that. Over the past 32 years, my motivations evolved into two things. One,

02:17:20.340 --> 02:17:24.500
regardless of the game I'm playing, be it Call of Duty, Madden, Mortal Kombat or whatever,

02:17:24.500 --> 02:17:30.180
I'm essentially getting mental exercise. I have to learn patterns in AI or stage layouts, anticipate

02:17:30.180 --> 02:17:35.300
what an opponent may do, etc. and base my strategy around that as well as tweak my strategy via the

02:17:35.300 --> 02:17:40.820
trial and error method. Video games, in a sense, are just the next evolution of a chess game.

02:17:40.820 --> 02:17:46.420
My second reason is that my real life is extremely boring 99.9% of the time. However,

02:17:46.420 --> 02:17:51.780
no matter how boring real life gets, things change a tad when I play a game. For that little while

02:17:51.780 --> 02:17:55.380
I'm playing a game, I'm not some schmuck that really can't afford to go out much and doesn't

02:17:55.380 --> 02:17:59.460
get invited to do anything. Rather, for that little while that I'm playing a game, I'm the world's

02:17:59.460 --> 02:18:04.260
greatest athlete. I'm the guy that saves the world and gets the girl. I'm the guy that single-handedly

02:18:04.260 --> 02:18:09.140
stops a terrorist plot. I get to visit worlds, real fictional or a blending of real and fictional,

02:18:09.140 --> 02:18:13.780
that there's zero chance in real life of visiting. I get to have really amazing adventures as a

02:18:13.780 --> 02:18:19.380
result of video games. This email has been brought to you by Bobby's googly-eyed Oculus Rift. Now,

02:18:19.380 --> 02:18:24.020
if only Dark Soccer, I can get him to use the damn thing to play Mass Effect. Garris all the things.

02:18:24.740 --> 02:18:33.940
That email again from Raginator. So, the question from Raginator, why gaming? I'll ask Loki here in

02:18:33.940 --> 02:18:38.180
a minute here. Let me read some of the answers from Ch- no, no, let me go to Loki, actually.

02:18:38.180 --> 02:18:46.500
Loki, why gaming? I don't know. Why do you play video games? Because they're fun. It's just,

02:18:46.500 --> 02:18:51.780
it's just a medium, I guess, to play. I mean, it's just like, if you were to play with Legos,

02:18:51.780 --> 02:18:57.460
or if you were to draw, or you're gonna do something else. I mean, just, I don't know,

02:18:57.460 --> 02:19:02.420
it's just what I ended up doing. You know, it's what I started off early with, like, you know,

02:19:02.420 --> 02:19:07.460
PC games and stuff. And, you know, I did other things other than just, you know,

02:19:09.140 --> 02:19:13.860
like, I had, you know, blocks. I was into a lot of weird hobbies. Well, not weird hobbies,

02:19:13.860 --> 02:19:19.140
as in, I used to collect hobbies almost. It was like, you know, rock collecting, or, you know,

02:19:20.580 --> 02:19:27.540
baseball cards, comic books, you know, all sorts of stuff. And it's just like, for some reason,

02:19:27.540 --> 02:19:31.860
you know, it's just something that we do nowadays. It's like, why watch TV? Why listen to the radio?

02:19:31.860 --> 02:19:37.780
I mean, it's to the point now where video games are kind of like watching TV. It's that common.

02:19:37.780 --> 02:19:42.900
It's not really, it's like, why eat food? I mean. That was a little bit me too. Like,

02:19:42.900 --> 02:19:45.860
if you go back to like my senior year of high school, and you look at me in the yearbook,

02:19:45.860 --> 02:19:50.580
I'm like in like six different clubs, and that doesn't even count. Like, I used to do a public

02:19:50.580 --> 02:19:54.580
access TV show. A lot of people don't know about this, because I don't want Travis Donovan ever

02:19:54.580 --> 02:20:00.260
finding the tapes of it, because God knows what'll happen. But, you know, I was doing all this

02:20:00.260 --> 02:20:05.060
stuff, like when I was a kid. And I think a lot of that was just because, I don't know if it was

02:20:05.060 --> 02:20:08.740
out of boredom, or just out of the fact like, you know, when I was sitting at home doing nothing,

02:20:08.740 --> 02:20:13.380
I just felt really depressed. So I had to kind of get out and do these different things. And I just

02:20:13.380 --> 02:20:18.260
almost overdid it. And video games, to some extension, were a real social thing at that age.

02:20:18.980 --> 02:20:23.860
I think the reason why I got into it, to answer the question, actually very similar to what

02:20:24.580 --> 02:20:28.180
Rage Nator said at the beginning there. Being able to kind of control the pictures on the TV,

02:20:28.740 --> 02:20:32.740
I think was a real kind of novel thing, when you're like six years old, five years old,

02:20:32.740 --> 02:20:39.220
and very impressionable. So I'm going to the chat room, and some of the answers there. Let's see.

02:20:42.100 --> 02:20:50.100
Brad from Pod Culture says, why not gaming? Black Wolf says, I don't do underwater basket weaving,

02:20:50.100 --> 02:20:56.900
because I don't have a pool. There is no place to practice. But a game console is cheaper than

02:20:56.900 --> 02:21:03.140
a backyard pool. Degenerate Johnny says, why gaming? Because it makes me harder than Peter

02:21:03.140 --> 02:21:11.620
North in a bukkake festival. What? What? Where every gamer has a voice, I guess. SSJ100Matt

02:21:11.620 --> 02:21:16.420
with a far more serious answer saying, escapism is the theme, is the thing for some people.

02:21:17.060 --> 02:21:22.020
Certainly. Well, Dark Sakura is still listening to the show. And she sent an answer over private

02:21:22.020 --> 02:21:25.300
message here, because if she were here, I'd ask her what she says. So she told me over chat,

02:21:25.300 --> 02:21:29.860
she says, I had a rotten childhood, and I would hide in books. Having a visual outlet,

02:21:29.860 --> 02:21:34.900
a world to get involved with would occupy my mind in a way that a book could not, because my eyes

02:21:34.900 --> 02:21:40.180
and ears were also engaged. Later on, I found out that as I am autistic, it gives me a very strong

02:21:40.180 --> 02:21:45.620
focus, especially if my senses have been otherwise overwhelmed. I've often broken myself out of a

02:21:45.620 --> 02:21:52.180
meltdown that way. Also, it's how I met my husband. As far as why I like it over another medium,

02:21:52.180 --> 02:21:56.900
it's that again, that process of immersion, having an active hand in what happens in the game

02:21:56.900 --> 02:22:05.060
makes it a lot better than being a passive participant. So there you go. Yeah, I think,

02:22:05.060 --> 02:22:11.300
you know, I use this, this kind of example today is like, some of my friends asked me like,

02:22:11.300 --> 02:22:15.780
wow, you play a lot of World of Warcraft. Aren't you addicted? Are you addicted to World of

02:22:15.780 --> 02:22:21.620
Warcraft? And then I go, well, have you spent your free time? You've watched every single episode of

02:22:21.620 --> 02:22:27.460
Lost twice. Are you addicted? Are you addicted to Lost? Game of Thrones? Are you addicted to that?

02:22:27.460 --> 02:22:32.420
TV tells me that you're addicted to, wow, because you can't just like it. You must be addicted.

02:22:33.140 --> 02:22:37.780
TV, TV. So yeah, it's like, yeah, I may play a lot of video games, but if you ask me like,

02:22:37.780 --> 02:22:45.300
what movies I've seen lately, I see maybe 10% of what I really want to see. I just saw the first

02:22:45.300 --> 02:22:50.980
half of Planes yesterday. And you asked me about TV shows. I'm especially clueless. The fact that

02:22:50.980 --> 02:22:56.340
I watched Orange is the New Black from start to finish says a lot about that show because there's

02:22:56.340 --> 02:23:05.460
very few shows I've watched from start to finish. Very few. So there you go. All right. That's it.

02:23:05.460 --> 02:23:10.900
That was the only email tonight. So mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com if you would like to send

02:23:10.900 --> 02:23:16.740
us an email for a future week. In the meantime, let's get to the FUs of the week. And this is

02:23:16.740 --> 02:23:37.140
the part of the show where we give our angst. Well, Loki, would you like to start us off

02:23:37.140 --> 02:23:44.980
tonight? Yes. Big fuck you to cyclists because you're always in my goddamn way on the street.

02:23:44.980 --> 02:23:49.220
There's this guy that was in front of me today, you know, not in a bike lane or anything, just

02:23:49.220 --> 02:23:53.940
kind of in the middle of the goddamn street, riding his bike super goddamn slow. I didn't

02:23:53.940 --> 02:23:59.060
go around him because if I go try to, you know, share the lane with him and go around him, then

02:23:59.060 --> 02:24:06.340
I might hit him and that would be bad. So yeah, fuck that. And also what is up with all these

02:24:06.340 --> 02:24:12.100
people? I know that you're not on a fucking team practicing for the race, but wearing your stupid

02:24:12.820 --> 02:24:20.820
skin tight, you know, uniforms with all your sponsors on there. I'm sorry, but no fat dude

02:24:20.820 --> 02:24:25.460
wearing that. You do not have sponsors. You're not in a race. You're not practicing for a race.

02:24:25.460 --> 02:24:30.420
I don't understand it. My boss has like a group of people that he rides with and they all have like

02:24:30.980 --> 02:24:36.100
gene uniforms and stuff. It's ridiculous. You're not in races. Okay. You don't have sponsors.

02:24:36.900 --> 02:24:43.060
What the hell? All right. Uh, dark Sakura sending her FUs, uh, by private messages.

02:24:43.060 --> 02:24:46.580
She wants you all to know FU to my fucking sinuses, which makes sense.

02:24:46.580 --> 02:24:54.980
Uh, and $115 school books for one fucking class. Oh my God. A lot of money. Um, my FU of the week

02:24:54.980 --> 02:25:03.140
goes to construction on highway 80 between Vacaville and Dixon. You suck. And I realized,

02:25:03.220 --> 02:25:10.180
look, construction workers don't hard construction workers work hard. I don't blame you personally.

02:25:10.180 --> 02:25:13.860
I know you have to do that stuff, but here's the thing that pissed me off about it is that there

02:25:13.860 --> 02:25:21.780
was no warning. If you know traffic is going to be backed up at one 30 in the morning for one hour,

02:25:21.780 --> 02:25:28.340
have a goddamn sign 20 miles up the road that says severe congestion on highway 80 due to

02:25:28.340 --> 02:25:34.100
construction. You built all these freaking Amber alert signs that only thankfully have

02:25:34.100 --> 02:25:39.220
to be used once in a blue moon. How about showing us traffic updates on those fucking things

02:25:39.220 --> 02:25:44.020
instead of, you know, nothing, which is what they show when there isn't, unfortunately some child

02:25:44.020 --> 02:25:49.780
who's been kidnapped. I would have sympathy if, if they chose to show a abducted child message

02:25:49.780 --> 02:25:54.340
over a construction message, I'd be okay with that, but to show nothing at all that warns me,

02:25:54.340 --> 02:26:00.500
Hey, try taking a back road is a little bit here. You didn't know that that this month is,

02:26:01.300 --> 02:26:05.700
you know, California repaved the road month. It's spare the air day tomorrow. God,

02:26:11.140 --> 02:26:17.780
anyhow movie. Yeah. Or click it or ticket or what else did they put on those Amber alert signs that

02:26:17.780 --> 02:26:21.940
have nothing to do with their purpose? Uh, report drunk drivers report drunk drive, which will,

02:26:21.940 --> 02:26:26.740
you know, it's some of the, I know a lot of this stuff is important and I'm not trying to belittle

02:26:26.740 --> 02:26:34.100
it, but I sometimes feel like when they do this, they it's it's like when the text message remember

02:26:34.100 --> 02:26:38.100
when they sent the Amber alert text message to everybody at two in the morning, the, about the

02:26:38.100 --> 02:26:43.860
kid that got kidnapped, tons of people disabled it right after that. Why did they do that? Are they,

02:26:43.860 --> 02:26:50.980
are they just, are they assholes that don't care about kids? No, it's because that hideous thing

02:26:50.980 --> 02:26:57.060
showed up on people's phones at two in the morning going like, it's like a freaking fire

02:26:57.060 --> 02:27:01.380
alarm going off in your house. It scared the living hell out of people. Like how about a

02:27:01.380 --> 02:27:08.660
little heads up a little warning. So unfortunately it's like when you, when you shoehorn things

02:27:09.860 --> 02:27:14.820
that were intended for this other purpose, it's people get desensitized to it and the same thing

02:27:14.820 --> 02:27:22.100
is happening with those signs. Anyhow. Sorry. I didn't mean to get on my soap box, but I guess

02:27:22.100 --> 02:27:26.900
that's what the F is the weaker for. Right. Yep. All right. All right. So there's a rumor. Well,

02:27:26.900 --> 02:27:31.380
it's actually probably not, it's actually not a rumor anymore. There was a rumor that, um,

02:27:32.580 --> 02:27:36.980
there was going to be a special 32 gigabyte Wii U bundle that was going to have the legends of

02:27:36.980 --> 02:27:44.740
the Wind Waker HD. Why I say it's not a rumor anymore because Nintendo. Thank you, Nintendo.

02:27:44.900 --> 02:27:50.740
Apparently Nintendo had a brand new trailer that they released and then quickly pulled off

02:27:50.740 --> 02:27:57.620
the internet, um, that showed off the new hero mode. And then at the end of the trailer also

02:27:57.620 --> 02:28:02.900
announced the bundle that was going to be coming out. And, uh, thankfully there are some people

02:28:02.900 --> 02:28:08.100
that took screen caps and what is this new bundle going to have in it? Well, it's basically a, uh,

02:28:08.180 --> 02:28:15.220
Wii U, um, black Wii U system with the game pad, having what looks like a decal on it with some,

02:28:15.220 --> 02:28:21.620
um, you know, the Zelda, like flourishes and stuff. There was like some little bit of gold.

02:28:22.180 --> 02:28:27.540
Um, I don't even know what the hell you would call it, like a gold emblem on it and stuff.

02:28:27.540 --> 02:28:33.700
And, um, it comes with special unique things. So yeah, it's sticker. Okay. And then it comes

02:28:33.700 --> 02:28:43.460
with Wind Waker HD for $349.99. Cool, but it's still $349.99 is my thing. And when you consider

02:28:43.460 --> 02:28:50.580
that the PlayStation 4 is only $50 more, it, that's a kind of a hard sell. Also when like

02:28:50.580 --> 02:28:57.380
other systems like the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3 are $199, that's a lot of games you can buy

02:28:57.380 --> 02:29:02.500
in between that. Granted, it's not Zelda, but this is not technically a new Zelda either.

02:29:02.500 --> 02:29:09.460
It is an HD remake that you're trying to pass off. Trying, trying to convince people to buy

02:29:09.460 --> 02:29:16.500
system for like it's a brand new Zelda, which it's not. I'm sure they'll announce said brand

02:29:16.500 --> 02:29:22.020
new Zelda next year, but there's still got a ways to go. If you put a demo for brand new Zelda on

02:29:22.020 --> 02:29:29.060
that disc, then you're talking. Yeah, that's true. Then those things will go flying. So.

02:29:30.020 --> 02:29:36.420
All right. Well, unfortunately, some sad news to end on tonight. And that has to do with a

02:29:36.420 --> 02:29:45.140
studio closure. Seattle based studio Big Fish has gone through a round of layoffs. It is closing

02:29:45.140 --> 02:29:51.700
its Vancouver studio and has gone into a 30 day consultation period about its Cork, Ireland

02:29:51.700 --> 02:29:57.940
operations. CEO Paul Thelen sent a letter to staff that talked about the changes, that talked about

02:29:57.940 --> 02:30:05.780
49 layoffs in its Seattle headquarters and another 70 employees re-aligned. 524 full-time employees

02:30:05.780 --> 02:30:11.140
in Seattle previously, 9% of the studio cut. Quote, I want to stress that our decisions are

02:30:11.140 --> 02:30:15.060
not based on company-wide performance or that of the people working on these initiatives,

02:30:15.060 --> 02:30:20.580
both of which are strong, but because of where the market is growing and quite frankly, where it is

02:30:20.580 --> 02:30:25.060
not. The most significant decision we are making today is that we are discontinuing our premium

02:30:25.060 --> 02:30:30.500
cloud delivery business. This service is not growing as fast as we had hoped it would and is

02:30:30.500 --> 02:30:36.180
not on a path to profitability. And this is why I'm guessing probably most of you have not heard

02:30:36.180 --> 02:30:42.100
of Big Fish because one of their big things was streaming casual games, was one of their big

02:30:42.100 --> 02:30:48.580
markets. They had Big Fish Unlimited that would do all these casual style adventure games. Yeah,

02:30:48.580 --> 02:30:53.460
I recognize them just because I used to set up a lot of their games and remember the mystery case

02:30:53.460 --> 02:30:59.220
file games that they had and yeah, I mean, mainly mystery case files because they did have a few of

02:30:59.220 --> 02:31:07.620
them on the Wii and the DS. Right. So, even though we might not play as many casual games here at

02:31:07.620 --> 02:31:13.300
OLR, it's always sad to hear about studio closures, so good luck to all those affected employees.

02:31:13.300 --> 02:31:18.660
That's never fun to report on. Hopefully, we'll have a new studio like we've heard about in other

02:31:18.660 --> 02:31:25.060
cases. So, that does it for news tonight. We're gonna open up the Skype line. It is time for us to

02:31:25.060 --> 02:31:30.580
open up the Skype line and get some calls. Our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio, or you can

02:31:30.580 --> 02:31:37.060
still call us on the good old telephone, 1-877-GAME-OLR is where you can call us.

02:31:38.100 --> 02:31:43.940
OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word on Skype. Speaking of calls, there's this weird new thing happening

02:31:43.940 --> 02:31:47.780
on Skype. I don't know if I should talk about it, but I think we're getting like spam voicemails.

02:31:47.780 --> 02:31:51.300
Like, I seriously had like seven voicemails throughout the week from random numbers,

02:31:51.300 --> 02:31:55.780
but I would try to click play because I thought, oh, maybe somebody's actually leaving us a bumper.

02:31:55.780 --> 02:31:59.940
Maybe it's actually a new listener, but I click play and nothing happens. And then I go, it's

02:31:59.940 --> 02:32:04.420
probably there. All the voicemails are the same length. They're all four minutes and 22 seconds.

02:32:04.420 --> 02:32:09.860
And I'm like, that's probably spam. Probably tell me to go to some website and put in my

02:32:09.860 --> 02:32:17.460
social security number for a chance at some credit card or something. Oh, lame. All right. Well,

02:32:17.460 --> 02:32:21.060
somebody's calling in on the phone right now. So let's see what happens when we pick up the phone

02:32:21.060 --> 02:32:26.740
and go to it. Hi, OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this? Hey, it's Jim Sally, guys. Hey, Jim Sally,

02:32:26.740 --> 02:32:32.580
what's up, buddy? I totally forgot. You guys have an old school telephone, man, sitting on your show.

02:32:32.580 --> 02:32:35.620
We do have the old school telephone sitting on the show. That's why I was surprised to

02:32:35.620 --> 02:32:39.860
hear from you on it, because usually you call us on Skype. Were you just wanting to test that

02:32:39.860 --> 02:32:46.180
it still worked? No, I was outside of my garage and the Skype lady was saying she didn't like

02:32:46.180 --> 02:32:51.300
my Skype. Oh, I'm sorry, man. I don't want to call you and be all choppy on the Skype line.

02:32:52.180 --> 02:32:56.820
So, Jim Sally, to what do we owe this phone call tonight? I was going to give my own little

02:32:56.820 --> 02:33:03.460
fuck you of the day today. Go for it. Some fuck you of Jim Sally's land, Jesus Christ. Fuck.

02:33:03.460 --> 02:33:09.380
Three months ago, I let my Xbox Live subscription lapse because I wasn't playing video games and I

02:33:09.380 --> 02:33:14.660
was busy and I was moving. I just let it lapse. And I have a silver, but I don't care. I wasn't

02:33:14.660 --> 02:33:20.580
playing anything. And today I went on there and I wanted to see if Breaking Bad was on tonight.

02:33:21.140 --> 02:33:25.300
And I went to the stupid fucking Internet Explorer and it didn't fucking work, guys.

02:33:26.100 --> 02:33:31.380
It said I have a fucking paid subscription if I wanted to use goddamn Internet Explorer on my

02:33:31.380 --> 02:33:37.300
Microsoft machine. Yep, you want to use any of that premium shit. It's behind the freaking paywall.

02:33:38.340 --> 02:33:42.420
What in the fuck is Internet Explorer Premium? It's the shittiest browser out there.

02:33:42.420 --> 02:33:46.500
They should apologize to me when I turn it on.

02:33:47.380 --> 02:33:53.860
If I make me pay for it. If anyone wants to go to YouTube or watch some fucking

02:33:53.860 --> 02:33:58.420
street videos, then motherfucking YouTube doesn't work. It's okay. They make up for it by letting

02:33:58.420 --> 02:34:04.660
you use Bing. Oh my fucking God. Bing doesn't work either. You go to Bing and you search

02:34:04.660 --> 02:34:08.180
something and it goes, you got to pay for shit. You go and look for what's on your Xbox.

02:34:09.060 --> 02:34:14.260
You know, that would be nice. They should allow you to set your... Maybe we should do this. Set up

02:34:14.260 --> 02:34:19.380
some type of website on orangehondrede.com that you could set your home browser to in Internet

02:34:19.380 --> 02:34:23.860
Explorer on Xbox. That way every time you open the browser, it would take you to a page that says,

02:34:24.420 --> 02:34:27.860
welcome to Internet Explorer 10 on the Xbox. We're very sorry.

02:34:31.380 --> 02:34:35.700
Where it would apologize to you every time that you do it. Welcome to Internet Explorer. We are

02:34:35.780 --> 02:34:39.780
so sorry. We're sorry. Sorry.

02:34:53.460 --> 02:34:58.820
Almost none of those channels, Jim Salley, will work without a gold subscription. Now,

02:34:58.820 --> 02:35:04.180
not all, some of them will, but like this Netflix, Hulu, the stuff that people really want to work.

02:35:04.180 --> 02:35:10.660
Nope. And this is what doesn't work. Nope. You have to have Xbox.

02:35:14.020 --> 02:35:21.220
But it will work on the Wii, the Wii U, the PlayStation three and the PlayStation four

02:35:21.220 --> 02:35:27.700
and your PC making my decision to buy a PlayStation three so much fucking easier.

02:35:27.700 --> 02:35:35.300
So it is a huge wall that Microsoft might want to reconsider. The new Microsoft CEO

02:35:35.300 --> 02:35:40.660
might want to reconsider. You know, I was considering buying an Xbox one for the

02:35:40.660 --> 02:35:44.580
pass through because I do use the Xbox to communicate with people. But fuck,

02:35:44.580 --> 02:35:46.740
I bet you my messenger doesn't work anymore anymore now.

02:35:47.860 --> 02:35:51.300
Be careful. I bet you my Amazon messenger doesn't work anymore. I'm a fucking Xbox.

02:35:51.300 --> 02:35:55.860
It's all broken. Fuck Xbox, man. Fuck Xbox, everybody. Don't buy one.

02:35:56.820 --> 02:36:02.260
Just always put the car wash on this shit. Buy an iPad. It's fucking better.

02:36:02.260 --> 02:36:06.420
You know, the one thing I'm kind of sad about with these new systems is that they don't have,

02:36:07.540 --> 02:36:13.220
they only have HDMI out and they don't have options for, I understand like component and stuff,

02:36:13.220 --> 02:36:20.180
you know, would have been nice, but like I play a lot on a PC monitor that has just a VGA in and

02:36:20.180 --> 02:36:23.620
I'm sure there's a cable I could get, but it's going to be an elaborate setup just to play

02:36:24.260 --> 02:36:29.860
on a VGA monitor. I really wish they'd have that so I could use a VGA cable like they had with,

02:36:29.860 --> 02:36:32.500
you know, the Xbox 360 because I get a lot of use out of that.

02:36:35.620 --> 02:36:40.580
So I agree. The Xbox one, whatever, everyone forget about it. Just buy a PlayStation 4.

02:36:41.780 --> 02:36:45.780
It's not just the Xbox one. It's both PlayStation 4 too does the same thing. So it's,

02:36:45.780 --> 02:36:49.380
I don't know, it kind of sucks because there's only really one TV I can play that on

02:36:50.100 --> 02:36:52.980
or I'd do PC monitor, which I really don't want to.

02:36:53.940 --> 02:36:58.500
Jim Salley, before we let you go so we can get other calls, I wanted to kind of call attention

02:36:58.500 --> 02:37:03.380
to this real quick. You made a forum post on the VOG forums this week, kind of asking for advice

02:37:03.380 --> 02:37:08.100
on how to kind of go about starting a podcast. And the reason why I wanted to point people to it is

02:37:08.100 --> 02:37:12.580
because I was like, I would love it if Jim Salley did a podcast, so I want to make sure he gets the

02:37:12.580 --> 02:37:15.860
help he needs. But then it kind of occurred to me, I was like, you know, other people might want to

02:37:15.860 --> 02:37:20.420
read this too. So I'd really encourage, you know, if those looking for podcasting tips or whatever,

02:37:20.420 --> 02:37:23.860
take a look on the forums. But is this something that might happen,

02:37:23.860 --> 02:37:26.740
Jim Salley? We looking at a Jim Salley show coming soon?

02:37:45.860 --> 02:37:50.100
A lot of us are too geeky. We don't know how to do things like drive a fucking stick.

02:37:52.500 --> 02:37:57.140
Even my friends I know can drive, they can drive a stick in great tourism all day long.

02:37:57.140 --> 02:38:00.580
And then they get into my little photo and they can't back it out of my driveway.

02:38:00.580 --> 02:38:05.460
I kind of love this idea, as long as it stays on that line of being tongue in cheek and not

02:38:05.460 --> 02:38:08.820
insulting. But I know you can do it. I know you can do it, Jim Salley. I think it would be funny.

02:38:08.820 --> 02:38:16.820
All right, Jim Salley, I'm going to let you go so we can get more calls,

02:38:16.820 --> 02:38:20.500
but thank you. It's always a delight to hear from you and look forward to your new show soon.

02:38:21.460 --> 02:38:24.660
All right, everybody. Stay tuned for more. Good night, everybody.

02:38:24.660 --> 02:38:25.620
All right. Night, Jim Salley.

02:38:25.620 --> 02:38:26.180
Good well.

02:38:26.180 --> 02:38:26.660
Night.

02:38:26.660 --> 02:38:27.620
Good well, Jamie.

02:38:28.740 --> 02:38:30.500
Do you want to send Jamie a special message?

02:38:31.540 --> 02:38:35.220
Jamie, I want to send you a special message right now. Right now, I'm snuggling my carload.

02:38:35.220 --> 02:38:46.260
I'm deciding it's you. I'm just squeezing the sinuses right out of your nose. Oh yeah,

02:38:46.260 --> 02:38:47.460
Jamie. That's for you, baby.

02:38:49.460 --> 02:38:49.780
All right.

02:38:51.940 --> 02:39:00.020
Jim Salley, I'm going to leave you to your pillow, Jim Salley. Good night, Jim Salley. Bye.

02:39:05.620 --> 02:39:07.300
That wasn't creepy or anything.

02:39:10.180 --> 02:39:14.340
Jamie's in chat right now going, ew, the snot is everywhere now.

02:39:17.380 --> 02:39:26.180
1-877-CAM-OL-R or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio if you want to give us a call.

02:39:27.300 --> 02:39:29.860
Loki, do you have any last minute stories?

02:39:29.860 --> 02:39:34.340
Yeah, I was going to talk about the release of a homebrew game for the Nintendo DS.

02:39:35.540 --> 02:39:41.860
It's called Aperture Science DS, and as you might imagine, it is a DS version of Portal,

02:39:42.420 --> 02:39:52.820
and you can download it for free on smelum.net. It's S-M-E-A-L-U-M dot net slash A-S-D-S.

02:39:52.820 --> 02:40:00.180
Aperture Science DS. So check that out. It looks pretty impressive, actually, for a DS game.

02:40:00.180 --> 02:40:01.060
For a homebrew.

02:40:01.060 --> 02:40:02.900
Yeah, it's pretty impressive.

02:40:05.860 --> 02:40:12.820
Also, the GamePop, remember them? They're one of those Android consoles that we kind of forgot

02:40:12.820 --> 02:40:17.700
about. GamePop was the one that had the monthly service that you would subscribe to, I guess,

02:40:19.140 --> 02:40:24.100
and they've actually announced some partnerships with different mobile game developers,

02:40:24.100 --> 02:40:33.940
including TinyCo, who does TinyVillage, Animaka, I guess, pretty pet salon, and Creative Mobile,

02:40:33.940 --> 02:40:40.660
which does the drag racing franchise. Also, Halfbrick, the Jetpack Joyride guys,

02:40:41.220 --> 02:40:46.740
Vector Unit, who do Riptide GP, and Glue, Heroes of Destiny, and they're saying that they're

02:40:46.740 --> 02:40:54.500
going to have about 500 games available when the GamePop launches in winter, and yeah.

02:40:54.500 --> 02:40:58.900
So it's going to be, I think if I remember correctly, it's like a streaming model.

02:40:58.900 --> 02:41:04.900
So you would be able to get a free mini model that requires a $6.99 monthly subscription,

02:41:04.900 --> 02:41:11.460
or the more powerful model of the console, which is $129, but the subscription service is still

02:41:11.460 --> 02:41:18.820
required. And then also GamePop games, I guess, can be played with a smartphone as well,

02:41:20.180 --> 02:41:24.580
instead of just the controller, if you really want to. Although, why the hell would you buy

02:41:24.660 --> 02:41:29.460
a gaming console to play on your phone when you can just play these games on your phone

02:41:29.460 --> 02:41:34.100
to begin with? Well, sometimes with the Wii U, you're going to play on the tablet.

02:41:34.100 --> 02:41:39.860
Remember, it's not all a card. It's $699, you get access to 500 games, so there's that too.

02:41:41.860 --> 02:41:46.260
All right. Let me give another call for the Skype line, if you want to give us a call.

02:41:46.260 --> 02:41:50.500
Boy, Bobby didn't get any calls tonight either. Everybody's shy tonight. 1877 GameOLR,

02:41:50.500 --> 02:41:54.980
our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio. At least we got Jim Salley. If nothing else,

02:41:56.580 --> 02:42:02.660
God bless Jim Salley. 1877 GameOLR, our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio. In the meantime,

02:42:02.660 --> 02:42:08.100
I want to get to Twitter topics here. Trying to bring it up on my iPad right now,

02:42:08.100 --> 02:42:10.820
except I had the Rocky Horror Picture show up on my iPad.

02:42:12.900 --> 02:42:17.620
All right. Just a couple of tweets tonight from Tigerclaw. Tigerclaw sending us a couple of

02:42:17.620 --> 02:42:22.900
tweets. One of them, a Metroid fan film Kickstarter taken down over IP dispute with

02:42:22.900 --> 02:42:29.060
Nintendo. Does this surprise anybody? Nope. I'm surprised somebody thought they could get away

02:42:29.060 --> 02:42:34.900
with it. Honestly. But, you know, remember we had the guy on a couple months ago who was doing the

02:42:34.900 --> 02:42:40.180
Zelda documentary? But that was different because he was doing a documentary. There's a difference

02:42:40.180 --> 02:42:43.860
between doing a documentary and doing a fan film. Remember, they tried to do the same thing with

02:42:43.860 --> 02:42:48.180
Final Fantasy and that bombed. Okay. We do have another call on the line. Let's go to it. Hi,

02:42:48.180 --> 02:42:52.900
you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this? Hey, guys. It's Degenera Johnny.

02:42:52.900 --> 02:42:57.540
Hey, Degenera Johnny. How you doing, buddy? You know, I'm bad. Can't complain.

02:42:58.100 --> 02:43:04.580
Good to hear from you. I want to apologize. I kind of missed most of last week's show. I was

02:43:04.580 --> 02:43:09.700
over at Gen Con last week. That's okay. I understood you sent in an email to the

02:43:09.700 --> 02:43:13.060
show and we somehow missed it. We didn't purposely omit it.

02:43:13.060 --> 02:43:18.820
But I worry that we get a lot of spam at our email address and it might have been

02:43:18.820 --> 02:43:20.580
accidentally thrown in. Oh, yeah. I understand that.

02:43:21.620 --> 02:43:25.300
I just wanted to call people's attention to the VOG Network forums. You posted

02:43:25.300 --> 02:43:29.140
your poem that you'd written there and it was brilliant. So, I just want to make sure people

02:43:29.140 --> 02:43:32.420
see it. Okay. All right. I appreciate it.

02:43:32.420 --> 02:43:35.620
No worries. So, what's up?

02:43:35.700 --> 02:43:41.620
Okay. All right. So, I was going to let you guys know. I just came across,

02:43:42.660 --> 02:43:49.540
during my time at Gen Con, I came across a certain game. I don't think you guys have covered it,

02:43:51.060 --> 02:43:55.140
but I might as well just let you guys know. I played around with it

02:43:55.780 --> 02:44:04.260
and I know we're talking about Hearthstone and all that, but this game, wow. It's a card game,

02:44:04.340 --> 02:44:06.660
but it's an MMO card game. Really?

02:44:06.660 --> 02:44:11.780
I don't know if you guys have heard of it. It's called Hex Shards of Fate.

02:44:13.700 --> 02:44:18.900
The title sounds familiar, but I don't know much about it. I feel like it's one of those games.

02:44:18.900 --> 02:44:23.220
We probably had a rapid fire news story on at one point and I didn't really look into it. So,

02:44:23.780 --> 02:44:27.140
but you have my attention. Tell us more about it.

02:44:28.420 --> 02:44:31.860
All right. Yeah. I know. It's like MMO card game. What the hell?

02:44:32.180 --> 02:44:33.220
Sounds wrong.

02:44:33.220 --> 02:44:40.580
It's being developed by Cryptozoic Games. They are the ones that, for those who listen to

02:44:40.580 --> 02:44:44.660
Hoard House, Cryptozoic has a license for the World of Warcraft card game.

02:44:45.460 --> 02:44:48.980
What actually, I don't know if you heard about this degenerate, Johnny,

02:44:48.980 --> 02:44:53.140
Blizzard announced this week, I'll throw this in here as a last minute story, that the latest

02:44:53.140 --> 02:44:58.740
expansion of the WoW trading card game is the last and that they are no longer going to be making it.

02:44:58.740 --> 02:45:02.500
They are ending that relationship and there's no plans in the future to continue the WoW trading

02:45:02.500 --> 02:45:06.660
card game. I don't know if that's because of Hearthstone or what, but thought I would throw

02:45:06.660 --> 02:45:09.700
that little nugget out there just because I read that the other day. Anyway, sorry.

02:45:10.500 --> 02:45:15.620
I heard about that actually at Gen Con. I was talking with one of the Cryptozoic guys and

02:45:15.620 --> 02:45:22.660
they did mention that it was going to be the last expansion. The relationship has matured

02:45:22.660 --> 02:45:28.180
with Blizzard to a degree that now they're going to develop their own type of games.

02:45:28.740 --> 02:45:38.340
I think this Hex Shards of Fate game is actually evidence of that. I'm just wild about it.

02:45:38.900 --> 02:45:49.220
Basically, Hex Shards of Fate, it actually had a Kickstarter earlier this summer, actually.

02:45:52.660 --> 02:45:56.660
They just wanted a Kickstarter just to finish off the game, but they managed to get like

02:45:56.660 --> 02:46:02.740
seven times the amount that they were asking for it, so now it's going to be able to be available

02:46:02.740 --> 02:46:10.260
for Apple tablets and Android tablets, so lots of stuff is going on with this game.

02:46:10.980 --> 02:46:17.460
It's actually pretty exciting. It's due to be released in some time this holiday season.

02:46:18.100 --> 02:46:22.740
Yet another game to add to my list for the holiday season. Here's my question. What's the business

02:46:22.740 --> 02:46:26.180
model for this game? Is it something that's free to play? Do you buy the cards? Is it

02:46:26.180 --> 02:46:30.820
buy to play? It's free to play. Oh, nice. That's always good. It's free to play. It's actually

02:46:30.820 --> 02:46:36.580
following probably the same type of business model as Blizzard is doing with Hearthstone, basically

02:46:36.580 --> 02:46:43.060
two bucks a pack. However, they're also adding a freemium service, so if you want to have a

02:46:43.060 --> 02:46:52.900
discount on your packs and gain access to tournaments free of charge, they're offering a

02:46:53.700 --> 02:47:01.220
VIP access, which is basically four dollars a month type of thing, kind of like a subscription,

02:47:01.220 --> 02:47:06.820
but you get a pack every week. Oh, okay. A free pack every week. It's a card of the month club.

02:47:08.020 --> 02:47:14.100
The card of the week club. Just say cancel at any time and stuff's in either cards.

02:47:14.100 --> 02:47:20.100
That's kind of funny. Right, exactly. All right. Yeah, so it's going to have an auction house for

02:47:20.100 --> 02:47:28.020
you to trade your cards. Yeah, there's so much information, and I just want to let you know that

02:47:28.020 --> 02:47:34.580
they are going to be at DragonCon, so anybody who's going to go there or you or Bobby,

02:47:34.580 --> 02:47:39.140
you know, if anybody wants to see around, they will be at DragonCon so you can see it for yourself.

02:47:39.140 --> 02:47:42.660
Degenera, Johnny, I thought of you recently because I know you're a big card game fan,

02:47:42.660 --> 02:47:46.420
and a friend of mine introduced me to a card game, and I did the whole thing where I actually

02:47:46.420 --> 02:47:50.580
went to the comic book shop and played this game with my friends. He was actually doing a lot of

02:47:50.580 --> 02:47:54.820
demos with this game at GamerX, so I want to give a shout out to this game because it was a lot of

02:47:54.820 --> 02:47:59.620
fun. Totally not the game you called in to talk about tonight, but I hijacked your call, I'm sorry,

02:47:59.620 --> 02:48:03.540
but the game is called Sentinels of the Multiverse. Have you played this?

02:48:05.540 --> 02:48:14.900
I've seen it being played not in my local card store, but I was seen it being played

02:48:14.900 --> 02:48:20.500
at GenCon though. Yeah, that's a fun game. It's a co-op card game. You don't play against each

02:48:20.500 --> 02:48:25.700
other. It's either you all win or nobody wins. I thought that was a really neat kind of catch

02:48:25.700 --> 02:48:33.460
to the game, so. Sounds very familiar. It sounds kind of similar to Lord of the Rings because Lord

02:48:33.460 --> 02:48:41.380
of the Rings is a game where you basically go up against a deck that is not you, but it is not

02:48:41.380 --> 02:48:48.740
another player. It's just you taking on scenarios, and you can do it in co-op, so it can be

02:48:49.380 --> 02:48:56.820
your own fellowship. So that's very interesting, and I've seen that. It's pretty interesting that

02:48:56.820 --> 02:49:04.180
card games are now making the rise of basically you don't have to find someone to play with. You

02:49:04.180 --> 02:49:10.340
can play it with yourself, or instead of going up against each other, you can just co-op into it. So

02:49:10.740 --> 02:49:18.260
it's just a new inventive way of card gaming, which I'm actually very excited for. So what's

02:49:18.260 --> 02:49:23.540
the name of the game again? Sentinels of the Multiverse, and we actually might get the guy

02:49:23.540 --> 02:49:28.340
on one of the shows later on, or one of the developers of the game, because I don't think

02:49:28.340 --> 02:49:32.180
it would be a good fit for OLR, but I'm going to see if some of the other VoG shows are interested

02:49:32.180 --> 02:49:36.660
in it. So if not, we'll do something. We'll do a Google Hangout or something, so. But yeah.

02:49:36.900 --> 02:49:41.780
Anyway, Degenerate Johnny, I should probably let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thanks for

02:49:41.780 --> 02:49:46.740
your call. Always a pleasure to hear from you. Yeah, my pleasure. Take care. You guys take care.

02:49:46.740 --> 02:49:51.860
All right. Bye-bye. There goes Degenerate Johnny adding yet another game to my queue to play this

02:49:51.860 --> 02:49:57.540
holiday season. I actually should be cussing him out and not thanking him. All right. Anyhow,

02:50:00.340 --> 02:50:03.860
a couple other tweets here from some listeners. If you do want to give us a call, we can try to

02:50:03.860 --> 02:50:08.740
squeeze in one more call. 1877 Game OLR or username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio.

02:50:08.740 --> 02:50:13.940
Tigerclaw sends us a tweet. Blizzard on World of Warcraft. We'd be lost without casuals. Oh,

02:50:13.940 --> 02:50:18.820
before I get to that, I should, Tigerclaw sent in that tweet on Metroid fan film.

02:50:18.820 --> 02:50:22.820
He wanted to clarify and make sure we report on the fact that the fan film was only going to be

02:50:22.820 --> 02:50:30.100
10 minutes and non-for-profit, but they were asking for $90,000 to fund it. 10 minutes? Come on.

02:50:30.180 --> 02:50:34.500
Maybe they were going to actually film in space. I don't know. No, I didn't read up on it. I'm not

02:50:34.500 --> 02:50:38.580
going to. It's a little. All right. Look, we got another call coming in, so let's go to it. Hi,

02:50:38.580 --> 02:50:43.380
you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this? Hi, this is Ragenator. Hey, Ragenator. How you doing?

02:50:44.420 --> 02:50:51.780
Okay, I guess. It's a webcam call. Good to see you. Nice to see you too. Just a quick story,

02:50:51.780 --> 02:50:58.580
last story. I don't think it's been mentioned either last week or the week before. Although

02:50:58.580 --> 02:51:04.180
you did mention some news that was kind of sort of related. I think it was last week and the

02:51:04.180 --> 02:51:10.660
week before you mentioned that Microsoft is getting rid of the Microsoft coins and they also,

02:51:10.660 --> 02:51:18.660
in turn, they're getting rid of the gains for Windows Marketplace. One thing that was not

02:51:18.660 --> 02:51:32.340
mentioned is that they're getting rid of the Zoom Marketplace. In fact, I found this out through

02:51:34.180 --> 02:51:42.260
email that Microsoft sent out to me not too long ago. The way it's been explained to me,

02:51:42.260 --> 02:51:50.180
the reason why they're getting rid of the Zoom Marketplace is because apparently the Zoom

02:51:50.180 --> 02:51:58.900
Marketplace is set up in such a way that it will only recognize Microsoft coins as a method of

02:51:58.900 --> 02:52:07.940
payment. It won't recognize dollars and cents or pesos or euros or whatever your local currency

02:52:07.940 --> 02:52:18.980
happens to be. Right. Now, the catch point too is if you have an Xbox 360, you'll still be able to

02:52:20.740 --> 02:52:26.740
use the equivalent to... But with the old tech, you're screwed, basically.

02:52:27.460 --> 02:52:33.860
Yeah. I think this is why Raginator, knowing a company's exit strategy for the inevitable

02:52:33.860 --> 02:52:38.500
day that they close their doors and the day and age of digital distribution is so important.

02:52:38.500 --> 02:52:41.940
And I think that's one reason everybody kind of goes to Steam a little bit because Steam has

02:52:41.940 --> 02:52:46.660
made it very clear, should we ever close our doors, we have the magic button that we can

02:52:46.660 --> 02:52:50.740
press that will make all the games DRM-free and you won't have to connect to the servers anymore.

02:52:50.740 --> 02:52:56.660
But when we talk about movies and music and so forth, that really sucks if you were one of those

02:52:56.660 --> 02:53:01.540
people who actually invested in a Zoom and it's like, okay, you'll have those movies, but you

02:53:02.180 --> 02:53:06.580
can't really use the Zoom now for anything else. Or like my HD DVD player.

02:53:07.700 --> 02:53:15.540
Yeah. The weird thing is, at least with me, ever since Sony burned me a handful of times,

02:53:17.300 --> 02:53:22.180
when I still have my PlayStation 3, I had to send my system in to get repaired. They have

02:53:22.180 --> 02:53:29.700
my videos reactivated. I slowly but surely made my way over to the Zoom service and been getting

02:53:30.660 --> 02:53:37.940
TV shows and movies and this and that. The vast majority of stuff were the previews,

02:53:37.940 --> 02:53:46.900
but I do have my fair share of the paid content. In fact, case in point, I've just been going to

02:53:46.900 --> 02:53:59.460
a neck case and video game music soundtrack kick. Whenever I begin to spare money here and there,

02:53:59.460 --> 02:54:09.700
I've been finding stuff up left and right. I've been using the service for my PC because I don't

02:54:09.700 --> 02:54:19.620
have iTunes. I already happen to have an Xbox account set up for when I still have the 360,

02:54:19.620 --> 02:54:24.420
so no need for extra passwords to remember, so on and so forth.

02:54:25.220 --> 02:54:34.420
Well, Ragenator, this is kind of a crap situation, but unfortunately, this is the downside to tech,

02:54:34.420 --> 02:54:39.220
and especially when our tech advances so fast. I think tough lesson learned,

02:54:39.220 --> 02:54:42.900
always take a look at that user license agreement even though you're not going to sit there and read

02:54:42.900 --> 02:54:49.460
all 27 pages or 99 pages or however long it is. Look for that part that talks about who really

02:54:49.460 --> 02:54:53.860
owns the stuff that you're buying and what's going to happen. Anyway, Ragenator, we're going

02:54:53.860 --> 02:54:57.300
to wrap up so we can wrap up the show, but any quick other thoughts you want to get out before

02:54:57.300 --> 02:55:03.380
we let you go? No, there'll be. I just want to really mention the closing of that particular

02:55:03.380 --> 02:55:07.860
service since it really wasn't mentioned before. All right. All right. Well, take care, buddy.

02:55:07.860 --> 02:55:13.300
Thanks for the call. All right. Have a good one. All right. You too. Bye-bye. All right. I think

02:55:13.300 --> 02:55:16.820
that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight. I'm going to close it on up. Sorry to those that

02:55:16.820 --> 02:55:20.820
didn't get through, although it wasn't exactly ringing off the hook tonight, but if you have

02:55:20.820 --> 02:55:27.220
any other thoughts you want to get through, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com. Sorry, did I

02:55:27.220 --> 02:55:33.780
already check? Do we have anything else? No, that's it. No more last minute stories. All right. Let

02:55:33.860 --> 02:55:41.860
me see. I think I had one other tweet here that I wanted to do. Oh, thegarthwolf sent us a tweet

02:55:41.860 --> 02:55:48.980
that says, I totally got into the 14 coral server tonight. Got to play the intro quest and now

02:55:48.980 --> 02:55:53.860
maintenance just started. Just my luck. Well, we were talking a little bit about the Final Fantasy

02:55:53.860 --> 02:55:59.860
14, kind of the bumpy launch there they've been having. Let's just hope in a week it's all a

02:55:59.860 --> 02:56:05.380
distant memory. Oh, I want to make sure I got this one in. Grandpa from Hoard House sent this

02:56:05.380 --> 02:56:12.500
tweet. I almost forgot it because he sent it earlier in the day. Oh, it's a video. Okay,

02:56:12.500 --> 02:56:16.740
long story short, it's another one of those fricking sensationalistic CNN things where an

02:56:16.740 --> 02:56:21.860
eight-year-old shot his 90-year-old caretaker and it was because of a violent video game. And I

02:56:21.860 --> 02:56:25.940
think, don't quote me on this, but I think this is the one that Piers Morgan on his Twitter

02:56:26.580 --> 02:56:30.820
wrote out there and said, don't tell me after hearing things like this, that violent video

02:56:30.820 --> 02:56:34.420
games don't cause violent behavior and dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, blah, blah, blah.

02:56:34.420 --> 02:56:42.660
So here we go again with the media, you know, well, and this is a nightmare that an eight-year-old

02:56:42.660 --> 02:56:49.220
boy would shoot his 90-year-old caretaker, but who was letting an eight-year-old game play violent

02:56:49.220 --> 02:56:57.220
video games unsupervised. I'm not blaming the 90-year-old, I'm blaming the parents. Where did

02:56:57.220 --> 02:57:02.660
he get the violent video game? Why was he playing the violent video game? Why aren't you asking

02:57:02.660 --> 02:57:08.900
these questions, Piers Morgan? Where's the fucking responsibility? Blah, blah, blah. Okay,

02:57:08.900 --> 02:57:13.940
Black Wolf is actually clarifying that Piers tweet was about a different interview with a guy who

02:57:13.940 --> 02:57:18.980
shot both his parents at 19. Fine. I stand corrected, but my point doesn't change.

02:57:21.060 --> 02:57:30.820
All right. That's it. I think we're done. It's been a crazy show tonight, but we're on out of

02:57:30.820 --> 02:57:36.100
here for the next two weeks. Thank you guys as always for listening to our show. Thanks for your

02:57:36.100 --> 02:57:40.100
download. Thanks for your support. We always appreciate you supporting independent radio.

02:57:40.900 --> 02:57:44.420
Hopefully you liked what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio, but if you didn't,

02:57:44.420 --> 02:57:48.340
just be sure to support other independent broadcasters. There's many people out there

02:57:48.340 --> 02:57:53.780
working very hard to put these types of shows together, and we all appreciate your support

02:57:53.780 --> 02:57:59.220
so much. I'm not going to ask you for your money or a financial donation, but I will ask if you

02:57:59.220 --> 02:58:04.340
like what you heard, spread the word. Tell a friend or two about the show. Post a nice

02:58:04.340 --> 02:58:08.820
five-star review on iTunes or give us a thumbs up in Stitcher or whatever. Help us spread the

02:58:08.820 --> 02:58:13.220
word about the show because that is all the marketing that we can afford is word of mouth.

02:58:14.660 --> 02:58:19.860
Loki, any last minute thoughts tonight? I'm going to just try to finish up Saints Row 4

02:58:19.860 --> 02:58:24.980
this week, maybe even tonight because I'm almost 100%. So I can probably do it.

02:58:24.980 --> 02:58:29.700
You can do it. My final thought is I hope I get to play at least another hour of Final Fantasy

02:58:29.700 --> 02:58:35.860
XIV tonight, but we'll see if that stupid maintenance finishes right at the time I

02:58:35.860 --> 02:58:41.060
get home from picking up Alan. That would be fantastic. Fantastic timing. All right.

02:58:41.060 --> 02:58:45.220
Well, that does it for another week here at Orange Launch Radio. We will be back in two weeks. Have

02:58:45.220 --> 02:58:49.060
a great Labor Day. Those of you guys here in the States, for those of you in other countries,

02:58:49.060 --> 02:58:54.900
have a great week. Enjoy your time and have fun playing the various online games that are

02:58:54.900 --> 02:59:00.020
launching over the next two weeks. We will be back for another show live Monday, excuse me,

02:59:00.020 --> 02:59:04.660
Sunday, September 8th. So we'll see you then with another episode of Orange Launch Radio.

02:59:04.660 --> 02:59:07.860
