00:00:13,834 --> 00:00:19,298
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight, August 11th, 2013, could Valve finally be making a sequel with a 3 in it?

2
00:00:19,779 --> 00:00:25,343
[SPEAKER_00]: One department store ad teases a Vita price drop, and is Amazon working on a new gaming console?

3
00:00:31,724 --> 00:00:36,465
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

4
00:00:36,546 --> 00:00:42,907
[SPEAKER_07]: It is Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 515 for this August 11th, 2013.

5
00:00:43,368 --> 00:00:52,010
[SPEAKER_07]: My name is Rob Roberts and I'm here to talk about video games, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle, gaming lulz, gaming insert whatever here with my co-host.

6
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:54,651
[SPEAKER_07]: Say hello first off to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

7
00:00:54,871 --> 00:00:55,291
[SPEAKER_02]: Rar.

8
00:00:55,551 --> 00:00:56,132
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, how you doing?

9
00:00:56,392 --> 00:00:57,132
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm unemployed again.

10
00:00:57,672 --> 00:00:58,393
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry to hear it.

11
00:00:58,713 --> 00:00:59,935
[SPEAKER_07]: That's no fun.

12
00:00:59,955 --> 00:01:03,158
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel better about it once the situation became clearer to me.

13
00:01:03,339 --> 00:01:03,619
[SPEAKER_07]: I see.

14
00:01:03,659 --> 00:01:06,522
[SPEAKER_07]: So it was one of those, maybe we are better off seeing other people.

15
00:01:06,662 --> 00:01:07,483
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's just put it this way.

16
00:01:07,623 --> 00:01:12,909
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to work for a hypocritical conservative Christian company that ruins other people's businesses.

17
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:18,776
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it is important to work for an employer that you can kind of get behind their values and all that stuff.

18
00:01:20,036 --> 00:01:27,739
[SPEAKER_02]: They had a really good environment there, but once I found out a bit more about them, I really started to feel very uncomfortable.

19
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:30,881
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, what's that sticker on your car?

20
00:01:30,941 --> 00:01:32,181
[SPEAKER_02]: What's that equal mean?

21
00:01:32,721 --> 00:01:34,442
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's for the human rights campaign.

22
00:01:34,562 --> 00:01:35,963
[SPEAKER_02]: I support gay rights.

23
00:01:37,163 --> 00:01:37,343
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh!

24
00:01:38,544 --> 00:01:39,384
[SPEAKER_02]: Next day, fired.

25
00:01:40,925 --> 00:01:41,885
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty much how it went.

26
00:01:42,866 --> 00:01:44,447
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not laughing at you.

27
00:01:44,507 --> 00:01:46,128
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just laughing at the awkwardness of that.

28
00:01:46,148 --> 00:01:47,088
[SPEAKER_02]: It's quite awkward.

29
00:01:47,329 --> 00:01:51,831
[SPEAKER_02]: That and also actually requesting the major Jewish holidays off that morning.

30
00:01:52,472 --> 00:01:54,153
[SPEAKER_02]: And they said, oh, we made the decision this morning.

31
00:01:54,173 --> 00:01:55,074
[SPEAKER_02]: You're just not a good fit.

32
00:01:55,894 --> 00:01:56,535
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, dear.

33
00:01:56,895 --> 00:01:59,316
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm not actually openly accusing them of anything.

34
00:01:59,376 --> 00:02:01,498
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just saying that those are the circumstances.

35
00:02:01,846 --> 00:02:04,287
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you can just work for vognetwork.com full time.

36
00:02:04,627 --> 00:02:04,948
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

37
00:02:05,008 --> 00:02:06,488
[SPEAKER_02]: If it paid me, I would be more than happy to.

38
00:02:06,548 --> 00:02:07,949
[SPEAKER_07]: Except, oh yeah, there's that.

39
00:02:08,149 --> 00:02:08,669
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry about that.

40
00:02:08,769 --> 00:02:09,470
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't have a budget.

41
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:10,030
[SPEAKER_02]: Oopsies.

42
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:12,251
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, say hello as well to Tech Master Loki.

[SPEAKER_07]: You there, Loki?

[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

[SPEAKER_07]: And what are you doing over there, Loki?

46
00:02:17,414 --> 00:02:18,854
[SPEAKER_07]: I was pulling up my stories.

[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, okay.

00:04:32,141 --> 00:04:34,622

00:04:37,363 --> 00:04:38,303
[SPEAKER_07]: What's new with you personally?

93
00:04:38,803 --> 00:04:39,164
[SPEAKER_06]: Not much.

94
00:04:39,724 --> 00:04:51,376
[SPEAKER_06]: Usually when I'm either working, I work swing shift, so I'll listen to OLR from work, or when I'm not working and you guys are all here doing the show, I'll kind of just play video games in the office or fold laundry or just be domestic.

95
00:04:52,096 --> 00:04:54,118
[SPEAKER_06]: So I decided I'd sit in on the show tonight.

96
00:04:55,500 --> 00:05:00,705
[SPEAKER_07]: I know we're going to talk about your gaming week a little bit later, but in general, what kind of games have you been catching up on lately?

97
00:05:01,403 --> 00:05:28,975
[SPEAKER_06]: most of the stuff if it has a Steam trading card thing in it then I've checked it out either a little bit or you know that trick if you don't want to play the game you can just let it run and then go take a shower go watch TV and come back when have your cards drop so you got sucked into this whole Steam trading card thing too like I did what what what's the allure of it it's just it appeals to my sort of OCD completionist

98
00:05:30,868 --> 00:05:31,208
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

99
00:05:32,449 --> 00:05:35,411
[SPEAKER_06]: And the thing is, is you can earn each badge like five times.

100
00:05:35,451 --> 00:05:40,034
[SPEAKER_06]: So once you earn, once you go like, yeah, I got all the cards, carry badges, okay, now do it again.

101
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:41,655
[SPEAKER_07]: Steam's like, do it again.

102
00:05:43,336 --> 00:05:44,937
[SPEAKER_07]: Put some money in your wallet, buy the cards.

103
00:05:45,158 --> 00:05:55,004
[SPEAKER_06]: I am eligible for the booster packs for like, I think, 13 or 14 games, and I still have about maybe 15, 16 more that I still need to play to get the things to drop.

104
00:05:55,645 --> 00:05:56,725
[SPEAKER_06]: Not a single booster pack yet.

105
00:05:57,286 --> 00:05:57,646
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm so glad.

106
00:05:57,666 --> 00:06:00,608
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I have not gotten anything either, but then again, I haven't really been playing much.

107
00:06:00,988 --> 00:06:02,409
[SPEAKER_07]: I got my second one yesterday.

108
00:06:02,429 --> 00:06:03,769
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm pressed like a panini.

109
00:06:03,829 --> 00:06:04,310
[SPEAKER_06]: I hate you.

110
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:07,851
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a foil card for Saints Row the Third.

111
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:08,351
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, nice.

112
00:06:08,371 --> 00:06:09,772
[SPEAKER_07]: You can sell those for a little more money.

113
00:06:09,892 --> 00:06:15,055
[SPEAKER_02]: I forgot who I was talking to, but someone needed all three of the only cards that I had, so I'm just like, here, take them.

114
00:06:15,395 --> 00:06:17,896
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait, how did you get a foil card if you haven't got any booster packs?

115
00:06:18,036 --> 00:06:19,937
[SPEAKER_03]: It was one of my randoms that I got.

116
00:06:19,957 --> 00:06:20,257
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

117
00:06:20,377 --> 00:06:21,357
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I didn't know that could happen.

118
00:06:21,377 --> 00:06:22,598
[SPEAKER_07]: Those will drop, yeah.

119
00:06:22,718 --> 00:06:22,818
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh.

120
00:06:22,838 --> 00:06:25,699
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, well, that's never happened to me, so that's something you have up on me.

121
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:26,840
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

122
00:06:27,341 --> 00:06:30,142
[SPEAKER_03]: See, the problem is I don't know where to buy and sell those cards.

123
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:31,983
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the community marketplace.

124
00:06:32,123 --> 00:06:33,184
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I have no idea how to get to that.

125
00:06:33,224 --> 00:06:33,644
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, it's easy.

126
00:06:34,405 --> 00:06:35,625
[SPEAKER_07]: Believe me, they make it easy.

127
00:06:35,685 --> 00:06:37,066
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we can show you.

128
00:06:37,206 --> 00:06:45,230
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really a brilliant thing if you make about it, and it totally plays to people like Alan, and myself, admittedly, who have that OCD need to collect something.

129
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:45,770
[SPEAKER_07]: Why?

130
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:47,211
[SPEAKER_07]: Because you can.

131
00:06:47,451 --> 00:06:47,832
[SPEAKER_07]: Because...

132
00:06:51,627 --> 00:06:53,188
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

133
00:07:18,686 --> 00:07:21,008
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, he wanted to review it for Horde House.

134
00:07:21,048 --> 00:07:27,914
[SPEAKER_07]: And to be fair, that was Actdeft kind of poking at him, which he's been kind of poking all of us for a while going, hey, play Team Fortress 2.

135
00:07:28,154 --> 00:07:29,215
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, play Team Fortress 2.

136
00:07:29,956 --> 00:07:32,858
[SPEAKER_07]: And then Phil from Koopa Club, I think, got in on that a little bit.

137
00:07:32,918 --> 00:07:33,999
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, play Team Fortress 2.

138
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:34,540
[SPEAKER_07]: Play it.

139
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:34,840
[SPEAKER_07]: Do it.

140
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:35,120
[SPEAKER_07]: Do it.

141
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,882
[SPEAKER_07]: And finally, X4 was like, fine.

142
00:07:36,962 --> 00:07:37,462
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it free?

143
00:07:37,602 --> 00:07:38,283
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I'll try it.

144
00:07:38,783 --> 00:08:07,537
[SPEAKER_07]: and so we all played one night on I guess Actdeft has this server abandoned server he knew of so a bunch of us played on there and loved it we had so much fun like it was just so much fun just sitting there blowing people up and it was great because you don't have to worry that you're not good enough or that people are gonna yell it was just a lot of like-minded people having a good time just shooting the shit out of each other and I was like oh I gotta get us a server we need our own server we need a VOG server for this we have a Minecraft server sometimes why can't we have a Team Fortress 2 server

145
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:08,437
[SPEAKER_06]: as a trial run.

146
00:08:08,597 --> 00:08:08,817
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

147
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:09,418
[SPEAKER_06]: Test it out.

148
00:08:09,738 --> 00:08:14,020
[SPEAKER_07]: So I remembered I had like $100 sitting in a PayPal account somewhere I hadn't used.

149
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:15,320
[SPEAKER_07]: So I was like, all right.

150
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,681
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, just a random hundred sitting aside.

151
00:08:18,742 --> 00:08:19,862
[SPEAKER_06]: All my money.

152
00:08:20,202 --> 00:08:22,443
[SPEAKER_06]: When he pointed it out, I was like, that must be nice.

153
00:08:22,803 --> 00:08:23,884
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you know what, though?

154
00:08:24,024 --> 00:08:28,005
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the modern day equivalent of burying it in your backyard.

155
00:08:28,465 --> 00:08:30,966
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like, you know, you haven't been earning interest on that in a year and a half.

156
00:08:30,986 --> 00:08:31,707
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been stuck in there.

157
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:34,787
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

158
00:08:48,926 --> 00:08:51,007
[SPEAKER_07]: on our website, vognetwork.com.

159
00:08:51,428 --> 00:08:55,510
[SPEAKER_07]: Look at the forums and you can check out the information.

160
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:56,530
[SPEAKER_07]: It's in the video games forum.

161
00:08:56,631 --> 00:08:58,091
[SPEAKER_07]: All the info you need about the server is there.

162
00:08:58,452 --> 00:09:05,516
[SPEAKER_07]: You might need a little help with the password, but let me just remind you guys, we used to have a little mascot, a little ferret on the show.

163
00:09:06,196 --> 00:09:08,678
[SPEAKER_02]: It's on my bedside table sitting on Duffy's head.

164
00:09:08,718 --> 00:09:10,158
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, Dark Sakura abducted it.

165
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:11,899
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't work anymore.

166
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,841
[SPEAKER_02]: And no, Actdeft, I do not have the hero's cap.

167
00:09:14,881 --> 00:09:15,221
[SPEAKER_02]: I need it.

168
00:09:15,822 --> 00:09:17,943
[SPEAKER_07]: Just in case you need that information when you look at the post.

169
00:09:18,416 --> 00:09:28,821
[SPEAKER_06]: And it is password protected, but if you ever check it out, like in your Steam client, you see a bunch of jerks on there with screen names that you don't recognize, make sure to let Rob know and he can spin the password to something else.

170
00:09:29,001 --> 00:09:39,846
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely, because we want it to be the welcoming environment for people that are like, I want to play Team Fortress 2, but I don't know anybody, and I'm not very good at shooters, and da-da-da.

171
00:09:40,126 --> 00:09:41,467
[SPEAKER_03]: No one's really good at Team Fortress 2.

172
00:09:41,507 --> 00:09:41,707
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

173
00:09:42,327 --> 00:09:43,007
[SPEAKER_06]: It's too fast.

174
00:09:43,047 --> 00:09:48,849
[SPEAKER_06]: It makes me feel old because I was the soldier class with the shotgun and I was in the same room with someone strafing.

175
00:09:49,249 --> 00:09:51,930
[SPEAKER_06]: I couldn't hit someone with a shotgun and they killed me.

176
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:53,371
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, I have a shotgun in your face.

177
00:09:53,411 --> 00:09:53,951
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't hit you.

178
00:09:54,111 --> 00:09:58,112
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel a little silly that I'm just now getting into this game that's like, what, five years old, right?

179
00:09:58,132 --> 00:09:59,253
[SPEAKER_07]: It came out with Orange Box, right?

180
00:09:59,513 --> 00:10:04,414
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I played it like a little bit on Orange Box on 360, but it's not even the same like now on PC, you know?

181
00:10:04,454 --> 00:10:05,435
[SPEAKER_07]: It just feels so different.

182
00:10:05,835 --> 00:10:05,955
[SPEAKER_07]: So...

183
00:10:08,189 --> 00:10:11,053
[SPEAKER_02]: I should probably play that, but I've had other things on my plate

184
00:10:27,373 --> 00:10:42,260
[SPEAKER_07]: uh definitely some more games throughout the week Alan and I would love to play tonight but we have errands to run after the show but that doesn't that might not stop other people from playing after the show so um Actdeft in our chat room says Team Fortress 2 is around seven years old oh my gosh really holy moly all right

185
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:50,483
[SPEAKER_07]: Speaking of other games and things, DarkSakura, I guess it's bugging out right now, but you were trying to open your Animal Crossing town.

186
00:10:50,723 --> 00:10:53,164
[SPEAKER_02]: I had three people in there and the connection crashed.

187
00:10:53,464 --> 00:10:57,146
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to open it one more time, but if it does it again, I'm going to have to leave it closed for the rest of the show.

188
00:10:57,506 --> 00:11:00,827
[SPEAKER_02]: Because our primary concern is keeping our bandwidth open.

189
00:11:00,927 --> 00:11:01,947
[SPEAKER_07]: That is, so we don't want to.

190
00:11:02,087 --> 00:11:04,048
[SPEAKER_07]: But it would be fun if you want to go visit Jamie.

191
00:11:04,528 --> 00:11:05,929
[SPEAKER_07]: You got the VOG pattern, right?

192
00:11:06,289 --> 00:11:08,970
[SPEAKER_02]: I did, but it won't let me put it on, so I think I just have to recreate it.

193
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:11,192
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, Bobby's pattern is probably better anyway.

194
00:11:13,015 --> 00:11:16,479
[SPEAKER_02]: But no, I actually can't use something that I got from somebody else.

195
00:11:16,899 --> 00:11:17,800
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll have to make it myself.

196
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:18,321
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't.

197
00:11:18,941 --> 00:11:19,262
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fine.

198
00:11:20,416 --> 00:11:22,478
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, so there's that Animal Crossing going on.

199
00:11:22,518 --> 00:11:24,559
[SPEAKER_07]: And then Minecraft coming back at some point, right, Loki?

200
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:25,860
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I want to get around to it.

201
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:26,221
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

202
00:11:26,641 --> 00:11:29,803
[SPEAKER_07]: So we want to know, what other games should VOG have a server for?

203
00:11:29,903 --> 00:11:30,644
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll look into it.

204
00:11:30,684 --> 00:11:33,906
[SPEAKER_07]: If you have a serious request, something that we ought to check out, let us know.

205
00:11:34,307 --> 00:11:36,348
[SPEAKER_07]: Free-to-play is really good, too.

206
00:11:36,989 --> 00:11:39,971
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what makes Team Fortress 2 so great, because it's free-to-play.

207
00:11:40,472 --> 00:11:42,533
[SPEAKER_07]: And people even make a little money off it, right?

208
00:11:42,573 --> 00:11:44,355
[SPEAKER_07]: Getting the item drops and crafting and all that.

209
00:11:44,535 --> 00:11:48,598
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, not anything to write home about, but, you know, something to buy trading cards with, right?

210
00:11:50,299 --> 00:11:53,483
[SPEAKER_07]: GamerX was a Kickstarter-backed convention.

211
00:12:09,602 --> 00:12:15,346
[SPEAKER_07]: to really just be a safe place for GLBT gamers.

212
00:12:15,446 --> 00:12:19,948
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's really important to know the con was not only for GLBT gamers.

213
00:12:19,968 --> 00:12:21,309
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think I went on this tangent.

214
00:12:21,349 --> 00:12:27,392
[SPEAKER_07]: It might have been on Horde House, but it always pissed me off when I heard people going, well, where's our straight gamer convention?

215
00:12:27,432 --> 00:12:29,333
[SPEAKER_07]: Why can't we have a straight gaming convention?

216
00:12:29,954 --> 00:12:31,575
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm like, well, okay.

217
00:12:31,595 --> 00:12:32,935
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what YowieCon is for girls.

218
00:12:34,196 --> 00:12:46,773
[SPEAKER_07]: When y'all are getting disowned by your parents and getting lost past in states that affect your lifestyle and people are bullying you and calling you names on Xbox Live, then you can have your little convention.

219
00:12:46,793 --> 00:12:49,717
[SPEAKER_07]: But otherwise, it's a 365 day a year convention.

220
00:12:50,117 --> 00:12:50,678
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

221
00:13:07,692 --> 00:13:19,618
[SPEAKER_06]: F-A-G, F-A-G, N-word, N-word, you know, it's not... It's like, bro, when you play Halo and you have to turn off everyone else's mics because you get sick and tired of being called a breeder a hundred times a match, then come talk to us.

222
00:13:19,678 --> 00:13:20,819
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll talk about a straight convention.

223
00:13:21,159 --> 00:13:21,999
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think that's happening.

224
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:22,440
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

225
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:47,469
[SPEAKER_07]: and I mean it's I mean and it's the bullying is bad enough with gay lesbian and bisexual and and then throw transgender into it and you know my I really it was it was very eye-opening in some of those panels to kind of hear like what transgendered people go through in in games and so forth so you know it was it was really eye-opening and I had a I had a marvelous time at the convention it was honestly something I kind of never thought I would see

226
00:13:48,769 --> 00:14:15,901
[SPEAKER_07]: so it made me just very happy to be there I did have some small reservations it was a first time con and so there were some first time con issues but I want to just make sure I am crystal clear it was really good for a first year con like beyond really good my minor issues were one the space was too damn small although the Hotel Kabuki in San Francisco is lovely and I love that it was in Japantown so all that stuff was nearby it was just a clusterfuck of people downstairs

227
00:14:46,611 --> 00:14:55,477
[SPEAKER_06]: The people waiting in line plus the through traffic because, you know, people got to get from point A to point B. They don't give a shit about a panel waiting in line if they're not interested in the panel.

228
00:14:56,277 --> 00:15:02,461
[SPEAKER_06]: And the hallways for that were only maybe two or three people wide and the ceilings were really low, like only 10 or 11 feet.

229
00:15:03,122 --> 00:15:06,464
[SPEAKER_06]: So that was it was really just claustrophobic and gloomy.

230
00:15:06,764 --> 00:15:17,789
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, which, you know what, I'm sure when they looked at the space originally and kind of, you know, had their, you know, thought what it was going to be in their head, I mean, what a terrible problem to have that your con is too popular, you know?

231
00:15:17,849 --> 00:15:23,632
[SPEAKER_07]: So, next year, you know, they have said it's coming back next year, and I'm pretty sure they said they are looking into a bigger space.

232
00:15:24,052 --> 00:15:26,473
[SPEAKER_07]: Although, I don't know if that necessarily meant they were looking at a different space.

233
00:15:26,713 --> 00:15:28,934
[SPEAKER_07]: I kind of got the feeling that they might just spread it out more.

234
00:15:28,994 --> 00:15:29,975
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, I'm kind of...

235
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:33,657
[SPEAKER_02]: The Hotel Kabuki has hosted different cons before.

236
00:15:34,378 --> 00:15:42,744
[SPEAKER_02]: And what they count on, I think, is that a lot of that traffic is going to start going into the Kintetsu Mall to go shopping at Kinokuniya or go get crepes or whatever.

237
00:15:42,904 --> 00:15:45,606
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and maybe they'll spread it out across different hotels or something.

238
00:15:45,626 --> 00:15:48,427
[SPEAKER_02]: And Japan Video really likes it because they do a lot of business during that.

239
00:15:48,568 --> 00:15:50,229
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah.

240
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:51,790
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, the environment was great.

241
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:54,171
[SPEAKER_06]: The Japanese street fair was going on, right?

242
00:15:54,191 --> 00:15:57,314
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, the overflow for the con was always in that mall.

243
00:15:57,474 --> 00:15:59,215
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah, it was already kind of a part of the circuit.

244
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:00,476
[SPEAKER_07]: They had a chiptunes DJ.

245
00:16:00,616 --> 00:16:01,597
[SPEAKER_07]: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

246
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:23,957
[SPEAKER_01]: That sounds cool.

247
00:16:24,157 --> 00:16:25,138
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, they were really good.

248
00:16:25,978 --> 00:16:27,699
[SPEAKER_07]: But the host of the evening was Pandora Box.

249
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:30,200
[SPEAKER_07]: And she was a contestant on RuPaul's Drag Race Season 2.

250
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,342
[SPEAKER_06]: Full disclosure, I loved her, rooted for her all through that season.

251
00:16:33,882 --> 00:16:34,222
[SPEAKER_07]: Ditto.

252
00:16:34,462 --> 00:16:42,406
[SPEAKER_07]: And I've even, on the fun little side project RuPaul's Drag Race podcast I did with the Game Boy guys, I even defended her many times.

253
00:16:42,446 --> 00:16:44,187
[SPEAKER_07]: And I do love her and follow her on Facebook.

254
00:16:44,447 --> 00:16:48,689
[SPEAKER_07]: But maybe, Alan, you can describe this better than I can, what the issue was with Pandora Box.

255
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:53,203
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know, it's supposed to be an inclusive convention.

256
00:16:53,824 --> 00:17:04,634
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of people had aired concerns online that it was just going to be a bunch of white gay dudes, because that's what San Francisco is really, and we were going to shut out the BLT portion of

257
00:17:05,094 --> 00:17:05,875
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, the convention.

258
00:17:05,915 --> 00:17:11,780
[SPEAKER_06]: So she gets up there and within like a minute she's talking about, lesbians play video games?

259
00:17:12,141 --> 00:17:13,642
[SPEAKER_06]: Ew, I don't like vagina.

260
00:17:13,682 --> 00:17:14,523
[SPEAKER_06]: And everyone's laughing.

261
00:17:14,843 --> 00:17:16,805
[SPEAKER_06]: Once I was born and fell out of one, I was done.

262
00:17:16,825 --> 00:17:19,327
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's like, okay, gay men don't like pussy.

263
00:17:20,368 --> 00:17:21,269
[SPEAKER_06]: That's your joke.

264
00:17:21,609 --> 00:17:23,211
[SPEAKER_06]: Which is like really insulting.

265
00:17:23,831 --> 00:17:26,434
[SPEAKER_06]: I hate when I hear my peers say it.

266
00:17:26,734 --> 00:17:27,294
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like really...

267
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:29,064
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like a big roast

268
00:17:46,173 --> 00:17:48,974
[SPEAKER_03]: Haha, nerds in basement, that's the first time I've ever heard that joke.

269
00:17:48,994 --> 00:17:49,535
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, exactly.

270
00:17:50,015 --> 00:17:51,355
[SPEAKER_03]: That's totally original.

271
00:17:51,435 --> 00:17:59,019
[SPEAKER_07]: I was just kind of like, dude, you are like the first thing at the first con of this first great thing, and that's what you're going to do with it?

272
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:02,901
[SPEAKER_06]: And everyone in that room had donated on the, sorry, it was 100 bucks, right?

273
00:18:02,941 --> 00:18:05,182
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, something like that, 90, 100, something like that.

274
00:18:06,082 --> 00:18:12,305
[SPEAKER_06]: So I was just a little bit like... And then she started talking about Grindr, about how nerds are introverts, so you're all on Grindr right now, and it's like...

275
00:18:12,845 --> 00:18:14,125
[SPEAKER_06]: They'd probably be on Grindr anyway.

276
00:18:15,246 --> 00:18:16,366
[SPEAKER_07]: You're on Grindr, bitch!

277
00:18:18,286 --> 00:18:19,006
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I don't know.

278
00:18:19,146 --> 00:18:21,227
[SPEAKER_07]: I just was kind of... I was over her.

279
00:18:21,247 --> 00:18:21,927
[SPEAKER_06]: It wasn't the best.

280
00:18:22,587 --> 00:18:24,447
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I still am a fan of her.

281
00:18:24,487 --> 00:18:26,508
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't go home and unfollow her on Facebook or something.

282
00:18:26,528 --> 00:18:27,068
[SPEAKER_07]: I was so mad.

283
00:18:27,448 --> 00:18:30,029
[SPEAKER_07]: But I was just like, that was a little lazy planning.

284
00:18:30,049 --> 00:18:33,229
[SPEAKER_06]: Her cosplay was good that I'm sure her team put together for her.

285
00:18:33,249 --> 00:18:35,030
[SPEAKER_07]: She didn't know what the fuck she was wearing.

286
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:35,670
[SPEAKER_07]: Shade.

287
00:18:37,930 --> 00:19:04,880
[SPEAKER_07]: enough negative because honestly lots of positive I was just in my basement in Animal Crossing we did a panel there, Podcast Cross Zone and had a lot of fun and I just want to give a shout out in big hearts to the guys from Koopa Club from Game Bar from GameBooey.org which I'm sure everybody was reciting that URL at the end of the day after that panel to Fox Van Allen from Wow Insider and the tech

288
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,601
[SPEAKER_07]: Techlicious, is that the one he writes for?

289
00:19:06,921 --> 00:19:07,821
[SPEAKER_07]: I look really stupid right now.

290
00:19:07,841 --> 00:19:10,843
[SPEAKER_07]: I forget which one he writes for, but he was a great moderator.

291
00:19:11,503 --> 00:19:17,387
[SPEAKER_07]: And the other folks that came to the panel, I was really worried no one was going to show up, y'all.

292
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:21,569
[SPEAKER_07]: And we had a relatively full room, a few empty seats, but not a lot.

293
00:19:22,089 --> 00:19:38,026
[SPEAKER_07]: and had a great time and I was telling jokes people were laughing we were having fun with it and yes that panel should be up soon Koopa Club's gonna put it on their feed so I'll let y'all know when it's up and because it was the last panel scheduled for that room we got there you guys rather got to run long so that was good

294
00:19:38,522 --> 00:19:39,923
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that was good.

295
00:19:40,283 --> 00:19:41,063
[SPEAKER_07]: And we had a great time.

296
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:46,746
[SPEAKER_07]: That was really the highlight for me, was just getting to do what I love to do, and that's the live panels and all that.

297
00:19:48,427 --> 00:19:50,247
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I want to go next year.

298
00:19:50,728 --> 00:19:51,008
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah.

299
00:19:51,108 --> 00:19:56,050
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I was actually trying to think of... Next year is my 20-year high school reunion.

300
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:56,590
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, my gosh.

301
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:57,631
[SPEAKER_02]: Shoot me in the face already.

302
00:19:58,331 --> 00:20:03,634
[SPEAKER_02]: But I want to do one con next year, assuming I don't move to Washington.

303
00:20:04,815 --> 00:20:14,140
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was actually thinking of making that my con next year, although I have another friend that's definitely trying to get me back to Fonami for Homestuck Cosplay.

304
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,160
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, jeez.

305
00:20:15,841 --> 00:20:16,521
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

306
00:20:17,102 --> 00:20:22,024
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't going to do it at all until she's like, we need to do this, and it's better when you have two people.

307
00:20:22,104 --> 00:20:23,645
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, fine, I'll make a costume.

308
00:20:23,905 --> 00:20:27,067
[SPEAKER_07]: I was actually going to suggest GamerX look into the San Jose Convention Center.

309
00:20:27,087 --> 00:20:31,670
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, yes, I know that's not the heart of San Francisco, but San Jose is still the Bay Area.

310
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:32,830
[SPEAKER_07]: It's easy to get to.

311
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:38,433
[SPEAKER_02]: They need to check the one that YowieCon is at, which is right outside Burlingame, where I...

312
00:20:39,574 --> 00:20:40,354
[SPEAKER_07]: Right by the airport, right?

313
00:20:40,474 --> 00:20:44,116
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and it was a really good venue for the convention.

314
00:20:44,496 --> 00:20:53,120
[SPEAKER_02]: Yaoi-Kan is still relatively small, and it was perfectly accommodating to everything, especially having electronic glass toys in the dealer's room.

315
00:20:53,701 --> 00:20:58,723
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they had Junkie Spot there, so I think that they need to... Did they have a dealer's room?

316
00:20:59,486 --> 00:21:00,346
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, it was small.

317
00:21:00,406 --> 00:21:02,887
[SPEAKER_07]: Like everything for a first year con, it was very small and some tables.

318
00:21:03,067 --> 00:21:05,608
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to talk to the organizer, actually.

319
00:21:05,888 --> 00:21:07,208
[SPEAKER_07]: He's a pretty approachable guy.

320
00:21:07,468 --> 00:21:09,009
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you can give me that information.

321
00:21:09,229 --> 00:21:09,429
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

322
00:21:09,709 --> 00:21:10,950
[SPEAKER_02]: Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.

323
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:12,390
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure we can set that up.

324
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:12,770
[SPEAKER_07]: Cool.

325
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:14,431
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'll definitely be going next year.

326
00:21:14,591 --> 00:21:15,571
[SPEAKER_07]: I had a good time.

327
00:21:15,771 --> 00:21:23,935
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we didn't do Sunday because we ended up taking a bunch of people up to our friend's place above the Castro and drinking until 3 a.m.

328
00:21:23,956 --> 00:21:26,197
[SPEAKER_06]: And we got trashed.

329
00:21:26,217 --> 00:21:27,437
[SPEAKER_06]: That was the finest night of the con.

330
00:21:27,537 --> 00:21:28,858
[SPEAKER_07]: That was the best thing we did.

331
00:21:28,938 --> 00:21:31,880
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it was just great to have everybody in one place like that.

332
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,281
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, who drank all this tequila?

333
00:21:33,381 --> 00:21:33,861
[SPEAKER_06]: You did.

334
00:21:33,901 --> 00:21:34,561
[SPEAKER_06]: It's 3 a.m.

335
00:21:34,741 --> 00:21:35,262
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, shit.

336
00:21:35,342 --> 00:21:35,682
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah.

337
00:21:35,922 --> 00:21:38,624
[SPEAKER_07]: Junko from Koopa Club and I were doing shots of Fireball.

338
00:21:38,684 --> 00:21:40,525
[SPEAKER_07]: And you guys know how I am after one drink.

339
00:21:40,825 --> 00:21:43,046
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I had four shots of Fireball that night.

340
00:21:43,066 --> 00:21:47,249
[SPEAKER_06]: But being in an enclosed space with all those people plus the alcohol lowering your immune system.

341
00:21:47,269 --> 00:21:49,670
[SPEAKER_07]: Con crud!

342
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:51,291
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and exhaustion.

343
00:21:51,331 --> 00:21:51,792
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't forget that.

344
00:21:51,832 --> 00:21:53,433
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a big one after Clue two weeks ago.

345
00:21:53,453 --> 00:21:55,474
[SPEAKER_06]: The con crud hit Rob hard.

346
00:21:55,594 --> 00:22:00,037
[SPEAKER_07]: I have been sick since... Somehow, I didn't really come down with it until Tuesday.

347
00:22:00,697 --> 00:22:00,877
[SPEAKER_07]: DragonCon

348
00:22:17,196 --> 00:22:18,137
[SPEAKER_02]: You remember my advice.

349
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:21,539
[SPEAKER_02]: And do not drink soda at a con.

350
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:22,560
[SPEAKER_02]: Drink nothing but tea.

351
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:27,623
[SPEAKER_07]: SSJ100 Matt in our chatroom says, on a scale of one to grandpa, how drunk was everyone?

352
00:22:28,224 --> 00:22:32,307
[SPEAKER_07]: Every single person was drinking except for Extifer, I believe.

353
00:22:32,647 --> 00:22:35,869
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, from what you're describing, on a scale of one to grandpa, you were on girl.

354
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:39,872
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Slag Kick was driving, so he didn't drink anything.

355
00:22:39,892 --> 00:22:40,352
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah, that's right.

356
00:22:40,372 --> 00:22:40,953
[SPEAKER_07]: He didn't drink either.

357
00:22:41,913 --> 00:22:42,293
[SPEAKER_07]: Good kid.

358
00:22:43,073 --> 00:22:47,134
[SPEAKER_07]: And Brad from PogCulture in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com is saying, Yay, Fireball!

359
00:22:47,294 --> 00:22:49,195
[SPEAKER_07]: And more Fireball is coming to DragonCon.

360
00:22:50,395 --> 00:22:50,935
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh-oh!

361
00:22:52,935 --> 00:22:53,636
[SPEAKER_07]: Here we go.

362
00:22:53,656 --> 00:22:57,356
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, there is something I'm making, Rob, that you should try if you like the Fireball.

363
00:22:57,896 --> 00:22:58,216
[SPEAKER_07]: What's that?

364
00:22:58,236 --> 00:22:59,257
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm making ginger rum.

365
00:23:00,017 --> 00:23:00,697
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, my gosh.

366
00:23:00,897 --> 00:23:02,537
[SPEAKER_02]: With actual ginger and actual cinnamon.

367
00:23:02,897 --> 00:23:03,378
[SPEAKER_07]: For reals.

368
00:23:03,458 --> 00:23:04,658
[SPEAKER_07]: I wish you could come to DragonCon.

369
00:23:04,678 --> 00:23:05,478
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to have a good time.

370
00:23:05,658 --> 00:23:06,178
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know what?

371
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:06,978
[SPEAKER_02]: If someone's got money.

372
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:09,859
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually do have places to stay.

373
00:23:10,467 --> 00:23:14,629
[SPEAKER_07]: If you are going to be in Atlanta, join us at DragonCon.

374
00:23:14,989 --> 00:23:19,792
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if we have the final details on the panel yet, but I'm sure Bobby will be spreading that all over the internet as soon as we know.

375
00:23:19,812 --> 00:23:26,475
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's tentatively Sunday night, around the time that OLR would usually be, which does mean we are not going to have a show again Labor Day weekend.

376
00:23:27,436 --> 00:23:31,578
[SPEAKER_07]: I apologize because that's two shows in about a month's span that we're going to be missing, but you know what?

377
00:23:32,118 --> 00:23:34,539
[SPEAKER_07]: To do the live stuff, gotta do it.

378
00:23:34,959 --> 00:23:36,800
[SPEAKER_07]: So, it's Labor Day weekend.

379
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:39,962
[SPEAKER_07]: I think a lot of you guys will be doing various things, conventions of your own and so forth.

380
00:23:40,802 --> 00:23:43,443
[SPEAKER_07]: Any last words on GamerX, Alan, before we get into our gaming weeks?

381
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:44,023
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I think that was it.

382
00:23:44,363 --> 00:23:45,743
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, Loki, did you have something to say?

383
00:23:45,763 --> 00:23:46,383
[SPEAKER_03]: Labor Day weekend?

384
00:23:46,884 --> 00:23:48,204
[SPEAKER_03]: Saints Row 4.

385
00:23:49,144 --> 00:23:49,784
[SPEAKER_07]: All day and all night.

386
00:23:51,385 --> 00:23:55,426
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that you've been playing this week.

387
00:23:55,746 --> 00:23:57,566
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually think we'll let Alan start tonight, our guest.

388
00:23:57,846 --> 00:23:58,826
[SPEAKER_07]: Alan, how's your gaming week?

389
00:23:58,986 --> 00:24:02,427
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're going to spend an hour on this segment because I've been playing everything.

390
00:24:02,447 --> 00:24:02,907
[SPEAKER_06]: Speed it up.

391
00:24:02,967 --> 00:24:03,928
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

392
00:24:04,788 --> 00:24:09,469
[SPEAKER_06]: Really quickly, back in March and April, I was trying to play Dead Space 1 because of the hype around Dead Space 3.

393
00:24:09,969 --> 00:24:10,630
[SPEAKER_06]: It was too scary.

394
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:11,230
[SPEAKER_06]: I chickened out.

395
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:12,171
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't touched it since then.

396
00:24:12,871 --> 00:24:16,474
[SPEAKER_06]: Necromorphs are terrifying, and it's claustrophobic, and it was very scary.

397
00:24:17,475 --> 00:24:22,279
[SPEAKER_06]: I also played and beat GTA 4, the main game with Nico, twice.

398
00:24:22,679 --> 00:24:24,160
[SPEAKER_06]: I beat it, and then I ran through and beat it again.

399
00:24:24,941 --> 00:24:26,122
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't done the expansions yet.

400
00:24:27,122 --> 00:24:32,607
[SPEAKER_06]: More recently, because of the Steam trading card stuff, I've played McPixel, which I burned out.

401
00:24:33,027 --> 00:24:34,007
[SPEAKER_03]: McPixel's awesome.

402
00:24:34,268 --> 00:24:35,348
[SPEAKER_03]: Just have to add that in there.

403
00:24:35,448 --> 00:24:41,671
[SPEAKER_06]: I burnt out on it kind of fast because I was trying to get 100% on everything where you have to find all the jokes, like all of the things that you can click wrong.

404
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:44,252
[SPEAKER_06]: Because basically there's a bomb.

405
00:24:44,692 --> 00:24:46,193
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just one screen, one room.

406
00:24:46,553 --> 00:24:47,814
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a bomb somewhere.

407
00:24:48,294 --> 00:24:48,734
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

408
00:25:06,169 --> 00:25:07,129
[SPEAKER_06]: Burnout on it.

409
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:14,651
[SPEAKER_06]: I played Revenge of the Titans, which is a tower defense game, which I played for the Steam trading cards.

410
00:25:15,731 --> 00:25:24,313
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't like tower defense, so once I saw that's what it was, I was like, okay, yeah, I'm not playing this past the hour and a half it's going to take me to get my little Steam goodies.

411
00:25:25,454 --> 00:25:32,635
[SPEAKER_06]: The longest time I've ever played a tower defense game is Plants vs. Zombies, which is a great game, but I don't care.

412
00:25:32,835 --> 00:25:34,636
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of like Bobby with First Person Shooters.

413
00:25:36,322 --> 00:25:53,378
[SPEAKER_06]: I understand the strategy behind them, I just don't care and then the game that I really want to talk about is Hotline Miami which is phenomenal and I'm really kind of irritated that I haven't played it since I mean it came out in October and I'm just now discovering it I got it, I haven't played it yet

414
00:25:54,167 --> 00:25:58,632
[SPEAKER_03]: It's sitting in my library and I don't have it installed.

415
00:25:58,752 --> 00:25:59,933
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I do have it installed.

416
00:25:59,954 --> 00:26:00,174
[SPEAKER_03]: Sweet.

417
00:26:00,454 --> 00:26:00,975
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't played it.

418
00:26:01,055 --> 00:26:02,717
[SPEAKER_06]: The music is phenomenal.

419
00:26:03,057 --> 00:26:07,662
[SPEAKER_06]: The creators of the game were inspired by that movie Drive with Ryan Gosling.

420
00:26:08,123 --> 00:26:08,803
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, awesome.

421
00:26:08,964 --> 00:26:13,689
[SPEAKER_06]: Which is kind of like a noir, neon, kind of new 80s feel to it.

422
00:26:15,891 --> 00:26:18,475
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think they even thank the director of that movie in the credits.

423
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:29,028
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's ultra-violent, and one thing that's great about it, aside from the flawless soundtrack, Drive was, I think, scored by Kravinsky, who's this French electro-producer.

424
00:26:29,448 --> 00:26:31,631
[SPEAKER_06]: They have a bunch of similar artists doing the soundtrack.

425
00:26:31,651 --> 00:26:32,813
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a completely Polish name.

426
00:26:33,253 --> 00:26:33,513
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

427
00:26:35,737 --> 00:26:38,278
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, the soundtrack for... Look it up on YouTube.

428
00:26:38,298 --> 00:26:38,839
[SPEAKER_06]: It's phenomenal.

429
00:26:38,859 --> 00:26:42,040
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we're going to play two of the songs from Hotline Miami during the break.

430
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,761
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, but that would only be for the live listeners.

431
00:26:43,781 --> 00:26:44,462
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, podcasters.

432
00:26:44,522 --> 00:26:45,022
[SPEAKER_02]: It's copyright.

433
00:26:45,102 --> 00:26:51,925
[SPEAKER_02]: Also to say, though, if people do want to see the game in action, Classic Game Room reviewed it not too long ago, and he does a really good review of it.

434
00:26:51,945 --> 00:26:52,926
[SPEAKER_02]: It shows plenty of the gameplay.

435
00:26:53,453 --> 00:27:00,481
[SPEAKER_07]: If I have time tonight, maybe I should do some livestream because I haven't played it yet at all.

436
00:27:00,541 --> 00:27:02,303
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a fast game.

437
00:27:02,343 --> 00:27:03,325
[SPEAKER_06]: It's also very hard.

438
00:27:03,385 --> 00:27:07,750
[SPEAKER_06]: It took me a while to figure out the learning curve on what the hell you're supposed to do.

439
00:27:09,291 --> 00:27:10,031
[SPEAKER_06]: What's in chat?

440
00:27:10,071 --> 00:27:14,873
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm laughing because Fifth Dream in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, Oh, look, I have Hotline Miami in Steam.

441
00:27:14,913 --> 00:27:15,233
[SPEAKER_07]: Who knew?

442
00:27:15,633 --> 00:27:17,233
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, a lot of you might be saying that.

443
00:27:17,334 --> 00:27:17,874
[SPEAKER_06]: I've done that.

444
00:27:17,954 --> 00:27:20,695
[SPEAKER_07]: If you bought Humble Bundle 8, you got it.

445
00:27:20,995 --> 00:27:23,035
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

446
00:27:23,055 --> 00:27:27,136
[SPEAKER_06]: And one great thing about it, it is ultra violent, which, you know, whatever.

447
00:27:27,597 --> 00:27:35,499
[SPEAKER_06]: But even just the title screen and the music that plays, there is something disturbing and really eerie about that game that they nailed.

448
00:27:35,519 --> 00:27:35,739
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

449
00:27:36,079 --> 00:27:43,784
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a part halfway through the game where the player character starts to hallucinate and you start seeing dead people at the 7-Eleven or in his apartment that aren't really there.

450
00:27:44,685 --> 00:28:01,697
[SPEAKER_06]: The song that plays in your apartment at the start of each mission, I'm like, I'm uncomfortable playing this and it's not because of the violence, which does get a little out of control at times, but the creators for such a... It looks like a Super NES game, basically, really captured...

451
00:28:04,018 --> 00:28:26,355
[SPEAKER_06]: it's a very unsettling game and it's really amazing in that sense and I think that's I played some Team Fortress 2 with the gang on the VOG server and no Mass Effect 2 or 3 I kind of burn out on that not for good but I have my third and fourth Shepard and I'm like I'll finish their careers later Torchlight 2 I've been playing a lot of that Enjoying Torchlight 2?

452
00:28:26,912 --> 00:28:55,378
[SPEAKER_06]: I've hit a plateau where I'm on an overworld map that I keep dying on like I just get steamrolled and up until that point because I'm playing it on veteran which is kind of like the hard mode not elite or super insane but just veteran I was doing fine I kept quaffing my health potions I was keeping up but this one map trying to get to the other side of it where the quest marker is I just get destroyed so I need to there's no way to grind really because monsters don't respawn I'm going to have to do some co-op sometime it'll be fun

453
00:28:55,652 --> 00:28:56,812
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

454
00:29:18,115 --> 00:29:21,998
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, well I told everyone they can have my pairs, it just saved me some perfect pairs.

455
00:29:23,239 --> 00:29:32,785
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, playing Animal Crossing, you know, I am actually back to Mass Effect 3 because I am taking my modding practice another step further.

456
00:29:33,786 --> 00:29:34,527
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

457
00:29:55,103 --> 00:30:22,081
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though I think the cute texture would actually work just fine But I'm thinking out loud So yeah, I'm still playing with it But I finally figured out how to do mesh replacements So that's one thing I am actually going to probably start live streaming again My playthrough of Mass Effect 3 Just so I can finish the missions I was on Because I'm like halfway through the game right now And a couple people asked me, so I might do it

458
00:30:22,941 --> 00:30:27,723
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I also am playing Borderlands 2 with Dan.

459
00:30:27,743 --> 00:30:31,704
[SPEAKER_02]: Because Dan's like, you're gonna like it, it's gonna be fun, you won't get that sick.

460
00:30:31,764 --> 00:30:33,385
[SPEAKER_02]: And to be honest, I did not get that sick.

461
00:30:33,445 --> 00:30:40,747
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a headache by the time I was done, but I wasn't like frighteningly nauseous like I usually am with FPSs.

462
00:30:41,027 --> 00:30:51,553
[SPEAKER_07]: Which, yeah, for any new listener, just because we get new listeners every few weeks or so, you get sick from playing first-person shooters because of the motion stuff, right?

463
00:30:51,573 --> 00:30:58,036
[SPEAKER_02]: I honestly think that the sickness I was getting was with low-res polygon.

464
00:30:58,516 --> 00:31:07,661
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the game that's always done it to me worst was GoldenEye on the Nintendo 64 and the early 3D first-person shooters.

465
00:31:08,334 --> 00:31:13,678
[SPEAKER_02]: I've noticed that I'll get a little sick with Portal 2 for a while, and then I was fine.

466
00:31:14,158 --> 00:31:19,742
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm having the same adjustment curve with Borderlands 2, so I think I might be getting over some of that.

467
00:31:19,882 --> 00:31:20,622
[SPEAKER_02]: That's good.

468
00:31:21,123 --> 00:31:24,765
[SPEAKER_02]: I still can't use my 3DS, and I think they... No, someone just left.

469
00:31:26,606 --> 00:31:33,311
[SPEAKER_02]: I still can't play the 3D mode on my 3DS unless I'm trying to catch a bug or something so I can gauge the distance.

470
00:31:34,071 --> 00:31:34,252
[SPEAKER_02]: But...

471
00:31:36,417 --> 00:31:39,361
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm also playing... What was it?

472
00:31:40,582 --> 00:31:45,568
[SPEAKER_02]: Back to playing some Drunken Robot Pornography, which is awesome.

473
00:31:45,769 --> 00:31:47,311
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the Jumping Flash-esque game, right?

474
00:31:47,431 --> 00:31:52,116
[SPEAKER_02]: The Jumping Flash with guns and dying really quickly that's a really freaking hard game.

475
00:31:52,156 --> 00:31:52,957
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that game's awesome.

476
00:31:54,259 --> 00:31:54,439
[SPEAKER_02]: And...

477
00:31:57,730 --> 00:32:00,751
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no wonder that was Actdeft that left to go get cherries to sell at my retail.

478
00:32:02,352 --> 00:32:03,073
[SPEAKER_07]: Stay focused, girl.

479
00:32:03,113 --> 00:32:03,873
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I know.

480
00:32:03,973 --> 00:32:07,575
[SPEAKER_02]: And also thank you for loaning me Kid Icarus because I really wanted to try it.

481
00:32:07,636 --> 00:32:08,036
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, no worries.

482
00:32:08,056 --> 00:32:09,156
[SPEAKER_07]: Just watch the hand cramping.

483
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:10,737
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a little crazy.

484
00:32:11,078 --> 00:32:13,259
[SPEAKER_07]: Try to put it on a flat surface to play if you can.

485
00:32:13,686 --> 00:32:21,014
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, going actually back to that, I'm actually thinking about starting Bayonetta again.

486
00:32:21,034 --> 00:32:21,735
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that's a fun game.

487
00:32:21,975 --> 00:32:30,664
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I loved it, and I didn't get too far in it, but since I've started drawing again, I haven't had the problem as quickly with my hand cramping.

488
00:32:30,704 --> 00:32:36,009
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it still does it, especially if I... It actually does it more if I'm writing than if I'm drawing.

489
00:32:36,910 --> 00:32:39,291
[SPEAKER_02]: So, but I've actually sat down with the controller.

490
00:32:39,311 --> 00:32:43,353
[SPEAKER_02]: I started Final Fantasy 7, which is almost impossible to play with the damn keyboard.

491
00:32:44,253 --> 00:32:46,954
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm probably going to be... I use a 360 controller.

492
00:32:47,034 --> 00:32:48,315
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we've got that.

493
00:32:48,515 --> 00:32:56,918
[SPEAKER_02]: And Dan's been playing a lot of really weird Nintendo knockoffs on the Sega Genesis emulator.

494
00:32:57,439 --> 00:32:58,339
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been hilarious.

495
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:03,281
[SPEAKER_02]: And he actually just went through the Ballad of Gay Tony again, which is...

496
00:33:03,821 --> 00:33:05,462
[SPEAKER_02]: Really, really good for GTA.

497
00:33:05,722 --> 00:33:07,102
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually really like the story.

498
00:33:09,743 --> 00:33:13,404
[SPEAKER_02]: So between the two of us, we've actually had a pretty bustling gaming week.

499
00:33:14,184 --> 00:33:20,126
[SPEAKER_02]: Despite being, you know, working full time and then finding out hoops they don't like when you're open minded.

500
00:33:21,566 --> 00:33:22,606
[SPEAKER_07]: Anything else for your gaming week?

501
00:33:24,067 --> 00:33:24,167
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

502
00:33:26,572 --> 00:33:28,960
[SPEAKER_02]: I know there's another game, but I can't think of it off the top of my head.

503
00:33:29,401 --> 00:33:30,445
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, we'll jump in later.

504
00:33:30,565 --> 00:33:31,187
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll come back to you.

505
00:33:31,829 --> 00:33:32,471
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, how about you?

506
00:33:34,321 --> 00:33:39,926
[SPEAKER_03]: See, I played a bit of Team Fortress 2 this week, and, um, what else?

507
00:33:39,966 --> 00:34:00,465
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Saints Row the Third, I went through, I was just trying to finish up some more achievements on the Steam version, and, uh, I went ahead and I finished off, uh, all the vehicle, uh, what was it, the, uh, cart, car theft stuff, the Saints Book vehicle stuff where you have to go collect all the vehicles and hijack them and stuff.

508
00:34:00,925 --> 00:34:01,765
[SPEAKER_03]: So I did all that.

509
00:34:02,105 --> 00:34:05,646
[SPEAKER_03]: And now I have to finish up some of the other stuff in the Saints book stuff.

510
00:34:06,567 --> 00:34:10,388
[SPEAKER_03]: One of which is the achievement of playing with both sexes.

511
00:34:10,528 --> 00:34:14,949
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have now a female character that I created just to get that achievement.

512
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:17,750
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I've been playing mostly my male character.

513
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:21,951
[SPEAKER_03]: So I need to get two hours out of the way on that to get the achievement.

514
00:34:22,351 --> 00:34:23,011
[SPEAKER_03]: And then...

515
00:34:25,752 --> 00:34:30,296
[SPEAKER_03]: Mostly just trying to get some of the other stuff that I've missed there.

516
00:34:31,997 --> 00:34:32,698
[SPEAKER_03]: What else did I play?

517
00:34:32,798 --> 00:34:36,621
[SPEAKER_03]: I tried playing some F-Zero GX and Dolphin just to see how well that worked.

518
00:34:36,941 --> 00:34:40,664
[SPEAKER_03]: I figured because Dolphin's been out for a long time that I should be able to run that game.

519
00:34:40,764 --> 00:34:42,626
[SPEAKER_07]: And Dolphin's an emulator.

520
00:34:42,726 --> 00:34:45,328
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's an emulator for Wii and GameCube games.

521
00:34:46,629 --> 00:34:47,710
[SPEAKER_03]: And it ran like shit.

522
00:34:47,950 --> 00:34:49,231
[SPEAKER_03]: So, oh well.

523
00:34:50,092 --> 00:34:53,395
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, remember, it takes a lot more CPU power to emulate, you know...

524
00:34:54,377 --> 00:34:55,297
[SPEAKER_02]: That actually reminded me.

525
00:34:56,278 --> 00:35:00,219
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been trying to get Planet Harriers working.

526
00:35:00,579 --> 00:35:01,319
[SPEAKER_02]: Haven't been able to yet.

527
00:35:02,679 --> 00:35:04,240
[SPEAKER_03]: And then what else did I do this week?

528
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:09,001
[SPEAKER_03]: A little bit of Call of Duty, Modern Warfare 3 still.

529
00:35:09,981 --> 00:35:11,662
[SPEAKER_03]: Just because that's all we're playing right now.

530
00:35:12,822 --> 00:35:17,083
[SPEAKER_03]: And I pre-purchased my Saints Row 4 on Steam.

531
00:35:17,583 --> 00:35:18,064
[SPEAKER_03]: When's that out?

532
00:35:18,104 --> 00:35:18,904
[SPEAKER_03]: That's out, what, two weeks?

533
00:35:18,924 --> 00:35:21,307
[SPEAKER_03]: It's out a week from Tuesday.

534
00:35:21,527 --> 00:35:21,947
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wow.

535
00:35:21,987 --> 00:35:23,709
[SPEAKER_03]: So the 20th.

536
00:35:23,749 --> 00:35:25,350
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you done the character creator?

537
00:35:25,971 --> 00:35:26,531
[SPEAKER_03]: Not yet.

538
00:35:26,571 --> 00:35:37,441
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't really, because originally on PC I was going to import my character, but because my game is modded, it won't let me upload my character to their server yet.

539
00:35:37,922 --> 00:35:43,267
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to somehow fix that soon, that they're going to allow you to upload your modded characters just because...

540
00:35:43,667 --> 00:35:45,588
[SPEAKER_03]: The problem was they have slider mods.

541
00:35:46,128 --> 00:35:57,393
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really have that on mine, but they have slider mods and stuff, and that can really screw up characters if you mod a character and then someone downloads that modded character without having that stuff done.

542
00:35:58,334 --> 00:36:01,175
[SPEAKER_03]: So they don't have that yet, but they're going to allow that soon.

543
00:36:02,956 --> 00:36:04,877
[SPEAKER_03]: But I was going to import that character.

544
00:36:04,937 --> 00:36:11,120
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have one for my Xbox, so I'm just going to import that into 4 because I didn't really need to mess with it yet.

545
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:13,381
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, good luck with that project.

546
00:36:29,247 --> 00:36:53,742
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm really pumped for the release of Final Fantasy XIV Realm Reborn and that open beta starts a week from Friday or last Friday so it's only days away at this point there's a character creator out for XIV by the way which is also a benchmark so if you're curious about XIV at all you can download that and check it out it's free of course and you know see how that works and play with the character creator there and see what your character would look like in game and the graphics engine that's really good for that game

547
00:36:54,883 --> 00:36:57,545
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah, I was messing around with that.

548
00:36:57,705 --> 00:36:58,806
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, Team Fortress 2.

549
00:36:59,847 --> 00:37:02,469
[SPEAKER_07]: Visiting some older stuff in Steam just to get the cards.

550
00:37:02,549 --> 00:37:04,411
[SPEAKER_07]: Like Bastion, I actually played through.

551
00:37:04,471 --> 00:37:06,793
[SPEAKER_07]: Probably further than I did on 360 when it first came out.

552
00:37:07,474 --> 00:37:10,516
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it's a great little game and it looks better on the PC than it did on 360.

553
00:37:10,796 --> 00:37:14,720
[SPEAKER_06]: I played that for about 20-30 minutes and was like, okay, this is neat and then I

554
00:37:15,421 --> 00:37:16,882
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you're missing.

555
00:37:16,922 --> 00:37:17,323
[SPEAKER_07]: It's fun.

556
00:37:17,483 --> 00:37:17,883
[SPEAKER_07]: I like that.

557
00:37:17,923 --> 00:37:18,424
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a good game.

558
00:37:19,425 --> 00:37:21,507
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I've also still been playing the MOBAs.

559
00:37:21,627 --> 00:37:24,130
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't remember if I talked about this on the last show.

560
00:37:24,490 --> 00:37:29,275
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I did a little bit, but I started getting into League of Legends and Dota 2, kind of both of them.

561
00:37:29,756 --> 00:37:30,016
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

562
00:37:30,036 --> 00:37:34,220
[SPEAKER_07]: There's things I like about Dota 2, and there's things I like about League of Legends, so I'm kind of juggling them both right now, which is...

563
00:37:34,981 --> 00:37:37,183
[SPEAKER_07]: Which when you're trying to learn them is really confusing.

564
00:37:37,623 --> 00:37:41,646
[SPEAKER_07]: But there's these Dota 2 championships going on right now, which you can actually watch.

565
00:37:41,687 --> 00:37:46,210
[SPEAKER_07]: But what I like about it is that it's not necessarily just like this Twitch thing or something where you're watching a live stream.

566
00:37:46,570 --> 00:37:50,514
[SPEAKER_07]: But you can actually watch in the game client while the people are playing.

567
00:37:50,534 --> 00:37:51,434
[SPEAKER_07]: And I thought that was kind of neat.

568
00:37:51,835 --> 00:37:57,119
[SPEAKER_07]: And apparently if you pony up some cash, which goes into the pot, you can get in-game items as well with that.

569
00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:04,287
[SPEAKER_06]: Mark Laidlaw, who's the sci-fi writer who writes Half-Life, has been tweeting about it a lot.

570
00:38:04,407 --> 00:38:08,832
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll talk about him during a story that's coming up.

571
00:38:09,133 --> 00:38:11,355
[SPEAKER_07]: Valve is pretty proud of Dota 2, I'm pretty sure.

572
00:38:13,596 --> 00:38:15,437
[SPEAKER_07]: I've also been playing League of Legends.

573
00:38:15,737 --> 00:38:20,338
[SPEAKER_07]: Dota 2, I'm still mostly in the single player tutorial stuff, like doing the bot matches and all that.

574
00:38:20,638 --> 00:38:23,659
[SPEAKER_07]: But League of Legends, I am playing a lot of co-op versus bots.

575
00:38:24,039 --> 00:38:28,360
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not playing player versus player yet because I feel like I still suck and I have a lot to learn.

576
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:34,521
[SPEAKER_07]: Although the last match I played, last night I think it was, actually boosted my confidence quite a bit.

577
00:38:34,901 --> 00:38:39,002
[SPEAKER_07]: Which is funny because we lost a match against beginner bots once.

578
00:38:39,122 --> 00:38:58,741
[SPEAKER_07]: but I was the only person out of the five to get any kills and I actually like had like a streak going that actually kind of boosted my confidence I was like alright I do know what I'm doing compared to these four other people so how bad could it be going into a player versus player match so that'll probably be what I do next so everybody pray for me as I go into that

579
00:38:59,241 --> 00:39:00,602
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's pretty much my gaming week.

580
00:39:01,143 --> 00:39:05,066
[SPEAKER_07]: So we will start to move into news, but I do always like to take a minute for housekeeping.

581
00:39:05,386 --> 00:39:16,836
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, we will have no show over Labor Day weekend, but that's still a few weeks away because I will be in Atlanta at DragonCon, which I hope you will come by and say hi at the VOG panel, which will be Sunday night at DragonCon if you're there.

582
00:39:17,556 --> 00:39:24,821
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, also you can friend us on Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR and Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

583
00:39:24,901 --> 00:39:25,422
[SPEAKER_07]: Be our friend.

584
00:39:26,022 --> 00:39:27,163
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's get into the news.

585
00:39:27,263 --> 00:39:31,406
[SPEAKER_07]: It's also been a bit of a slow news week, but we still got a few things we want to point out that's going on.

586
00:39:31,446 --> 00:39:32,707
[SPEAKER_07]: So Loki, why don't you start us off?

587
00:39:33,052 --> 00:39:38,358
[SPEAKER_03]: Amazon is planning on making a console that will support the Amazon Marketplace.

588
00:39:55,755 --> 00:40:00,338
[SPEAKER_03]: As far as details beyond that, no idea what it's going to be.

589
00:40:01,318 --> 00:40:09,463
[SPEAKER_03]: But basically, there's still rumors that Google's developing their own console, so I don't know.

590
00:40:10,264 --> 00:40:10,624
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

591
00:40:12,085 --> 00:40:15,727
[SPEAKER_03]: They're saying that maybe we'll see it around Black Friday, but

592
00:40:18,806 --> 00:40:19,126
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

593
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:20,167
[SPEAKER_03]: It's funny.

594
00:40:20,187 --> 00:40:28,152
[SPEAKER_03]: The more and more I hear about other companies coming out with their own consoles and the specs and the features sound better, the less and less I like my Ouya.

595
00:40:29,073 --> 00:40:31,695
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, and it's also one of those things where it's like, good God, what did Ouya do?

596
00:40:34,537 --> 00:40:38,941
[SPEAKER_07]: Now I'm worried that everybody wants a piece of that because the Kickstarter was so successful.

597
00:40:38,981 --> 00:40:40,843
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like we're seeing all of these clones.

598
00:40:40,883 --> 00:40:48,791
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm like, surely we see the end of this coming where all this crap saturates the market and then none of them do well.

599
00:40:48,991 --> 00:40:51,592
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think it's necessarily that they're going to saturate the market.

600
00:40:51,672 --> 00:40:56,654
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just going to be... I mean, you can kind of compare that to tablets.

601
00:40:57,115 --> 00:41:00,716
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, my God, there's so many tablets out there that saturate the market, and none of them are going to do well.

602
00:41:01,396 --> 00:41:11,881
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's what's going to end up happening is when you get all these individual marketplaces, though, because you have Ouya, which is on its own marketplace, and Amazon, which is its own marketplace...

603
00:41:12,822 --> 00:41:20,249
[SPEAKER_03]: and, you know, the Mad Catz one, though, that is on just a regular, you know, Google Play Marketplace, so that might be okay.

604
00:41:20,349 --> 00:41:25,474
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, you know, I would assume that the Google one would be on, you know, the Google Play Marketplace.

605
00:41:25,995 --> 00:41:30,299
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's just when you start segmenting the marketplace like that, that's when you run into problems.

606
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:46,251
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's great for indie developers that want to, I guess, get their game out because now they can, you know, put it on all these marketplaces because, I mean, porting your game from, like, Android to the Amazon marketplace is basically just, you know, putting it on another marketplace because they're pretty much the same.

607
00:41:48,843 --> 00:42:06,424
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's just, and then also spec-wise, like, you know, some of these newer consoles are going to be a lot better spec-wise than, you know, the Ouya, and even, you know, the Ouya may have done okay as far as Kickstarter goes, but the way they've been handling everything, and oh, GameStick was the other one, that's another marketplace's own thing.

608
00:42:07,184 --> 00:42:30,579
[SPEAKER_03]: um and then there was the other one that was like streaming games i don't know but so still there's a ton of different options out there and at the end of the day they're all kind of offering similar things there's not a lot of exclusive stuff that you know differentiates one from the next and you know the experience isn't all that great at least for the uya right now because that's the only one that's actually to market so far um

609
00:42:32,772 --> 00:42:37,575
[SPEAKER_07]: I think this question is a bit of an eh, but other people are asking it, so I'll ask it too.

610
00:42:38,255 --> 00:42:41,637
[SPEAKER_07]: Does Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo have anything to be worried about with these consoles?

611
00:42:41,937 --> 00:42:42,097
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

612
00:42:42,117 --> 00:42:42,317
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?

613
00:42:43,258 --> 00:42:43,838
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, no.

614
00:42:44,459 --> 00:42:50,442
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think that they have anything to be worried about right now, but the way things are going right now is everything kind of trending towards...

615
00:42:50,922 --> 00:42:51,322
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

616
00:43:11,532 --> 00:43:15,733
[SPEAKER_03]: It may not be a very powerful platform, but it's an independent platform so far.

617
00:43:15,753 --> 00:43:21,175
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's still closed, but you've got to have some sort of restrictions in place so there's not rampant piracy.

618
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:25,176
[SPEAKER_03]: Because as far as I'm aware, I don't think you can really pirate Ouya games.

619
00:43:25,736 --> 00:43:26,996
[SPEAKER_03]: Although I haven't rooted my Ouya yet.

620
00:43:27,396 --> 00:43:27,637
[SPEAKER_03]: Soon.

621
00:43:28,817 --> 00:43:31,718
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't really know how it really treats that.

622
00:43:31,798 --> 00:43:36,259
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think that's kind of been the draw is there's all these indie games.

623
00:43:37,399 --> 00:43:38,199
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

624
00:44:01,787 --> 00:44:06,588
[SPEAKER_03]: The platform, they're much bigger than a startup company like Ouya or PlayStick, you know, for example.

625
00:44:06,668 --> 00:44:11,289
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think it's promising, but I'd have to see what their specs are going to be.

626
00:44:11,570 --> 00:44:17,571
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, hell, Amazon making a console wouldn't be that crazy considering they have their own tablet.

627
00:44:17,651 --> 00:44:19,692
[SPEAKER_03]: So why not?

628
00:44:20,052 --> 00:44:21,052
[SPEAKER_03]: I could see that happening.

629
00:44:22,575 --> 00:44:25,157
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, well, we'll see if there's any truth to this.

630
00:44:25,478 --> 00:44:34,805
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the one thing, too, I want to throw out there is that it would be interesting with Amazon because they do have all the things that are tied to Amazon Prime, such as their version of Netflix, which, you know, big deal.

631
00:44:35,226 --> 00:44:37,648
[SPEAKER_07]: All those boxes will play the streaming video things.

632
00:44:38,208 --> 00:44:38,488
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura.com

633
00:44:54,496 --> 00:45:19,637
[SPEAKER_03]: but the price even of their tablets is coming down so much that I would think it'd be in their best interest not necessarily to come out with a console but to maybe come out with something that you can play your games on your tablet and then you can stream them to your TV even almost like that Google Chromecast thing and have a controller and stuff so then that way you can take it on the go and you can play with it at home and stuff

634
00:45:20,177 --> 00:45:32,210
[SPEAKER_03]: How I really wish the Wii U was kind of handled where you could, you know, that'd be awesome to have your games loaded on like a compact, not compact flash, but like, you know, some sort of, you know, flash memory or something like that.

635
00:45:32,491 --> 00:45:36,155
[SPEAKER_03]: And then that way you can play them on the go instead of having it stream from your console.

636
00:45:36,195 --> 00:45:36,816
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, you know, that...

637
00:45:37,256 --> 00:45:42,219
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not going to work hardware-wise, but it would still be kind of cool if you could do that easily.

638
00:45:42,259 --> 00:45:56,448
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know that was something that they wanted to do with the Vita even, where you play your Vita version of MLB or you play your PS3 version of MLB and then you flip it over to the Vita and you take it on the road and that kind of stuff.

639
00:45:56,788 --> 00:45:57,768
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that would be really cool.

640
00:45:58,249 --> 00:45:58,469
[SPEAKER_03]: But...

641
00:45:59,565 --> 00:46:00,367
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, we'll have to see.

642
00:46:00,407 --> 00:46:01,409
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, right now it's just a rumor.

643
00:46:02,271 --> 00:46:04,136
[SPEAKER_03]: And, I mean, hell, Apple.

644
00:46:04,376 --> 00:46:06,100
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's been a rumor for the longest time.

645
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:09,708
[SPEAKER_03]: Apple's gonna do something with Apple TV or something that turned that into a console, so.

646
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:12,660
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

647
00:46:13,561 --> 00:46:21,403
[SPEAKER_03]: All these different options, though, that are not necessarily the major console manufacturers are good options, I think, for indies.

648
00:46:21,743 --> 00:46:33,287
[SPEAKER_03]: And even now, even with the way they're opening it up a little bit for indies, especially the Xbox One and the PlayStation 4 and stuff, it's a good time to be indie, I guess.

649
00:46:34,446 --> 00:46:34,726
[SPEAKER_07]: Left 4 Dead 3

650
00:46:53,419 --> 00:46:58,420
[SPEAKER_07]: Now this is a little more than, you know, well, since they did 1 and 2, a 3's gotta happen at some point.

651
00:46:58,460 --> 00:46:59,201
[SPEAKER_07]: But here's what happened.

652
00:46:59,841 --> 00:47:12,324
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently a Valve Studio Tour was given to some folks who actually got a snapshot of somebody's computer that actually had references to... Well, it was like a changelog of everything that's been going on.

653
00:47:12,704 --> 00:47:15,965
[SPEAKER_07]: It had references to Source 2, which we know has been a thing.

654
00:47:16,025 --> 00:47:17,825
[SPEAKER_07]: Valve's openly said they're working on Source.

655
00:47:17,845 --> 00:47:19,586
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so that's not really a surprise, but...

656
00:47:20,206 --> 00:47:22,669
[SPEAKER_07]: and L4D3 was also there.

657
00:47:22,809 --> 00:47:25,512
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's something that's happening.

658
00:47:25,812 --> 00:47:28,394
[SPEAKER_07]: Could that be the first game to use Source 2?

659
00:47:29,596 --> 00:47:30,176
[SPEAKER_07]: Who knows?

660
00:47:30,697 --> 00:47:32,298
[SPEAKER_07]: And not, unfortunately, Half-Life 3.

661
00:47:32,739 --> 00:47:33,259
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

662
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:39,546
[SPEAKER_07]: But apparently more thoughts come out after it that say, hey, this is actually something that is happening.

663
00:47:40,346 --> 00:47:44,209
[SPEAKER_07]: So, Alan, I'm sure you've been following this a bit.

664
00:47:44,249 --> 00:47:44,750
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you think?

665
00:47:44,790 --> 00:47:55,398
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the Source engine, which was designed and made for Half-Life 2 originally, which is 2003-2004, anything that Valve has put out that's not Dota is on Source.

666
00:47:55,718 --> 00:48:02,103
[SPEAKER_06]: Team Fortress 2, Portal, Half-Life 2 Episode 2, it's all the modified original Source engine.

667
00:48:03,185 --> 00:48:17,224
[SPEAKER_06]: So if Source 2 is done to the point where they can release Left 4 Dead 3 on it, even if it takes another three years, if this is the product, this is the Source 2 engine running, that means Half-Life 3, they have the API that they're going to build the game on top of, so now...

668
00:48:18,655 --> 00:48:19,135
[SPEAKER_06]: Announce it.

669
00:48:19,335 --> 00:48:20,436
[SPEAKER_07]: Or should you just give up hope?

670
00:48:20,776 --> 00:48:20,916
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

671
00:48:21,377 --> 00:48:30,022
[SPEAKER_06]: Mark Laidlaw, who I kind of tweeted with a couple weeks ago, he posted a vine of him in an elevator and he was kind of hovering his finger over the three button.

672
00:48:30,842 --> 00:48:31,503
[SPEAKER_06]: Hovering, hovering.

673
00:48:31,523 --> 00:48:35,305
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the last second he pushes L for lobby like he won't push three.

674
00:48:35,465 --> 00:48:37,386
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like, ugh, like a dagger in my heart.

675
00:48:38,827 --> 00:48:43,971
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, wasn't there something else, too, where it was like he said something about playing Pikmin 3, and you tweeted him, like, what's it like?

676
00:48:44,471 --> 00:48:49,695
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, he was like, uh, Pikmin 3's really good, and I was like, uh, so, Mark, what's it like to play a sequel with a 3 in it?

677
00:48:49,715 --> 00:48:50,335
[SPEAKER_06]: What's that like?

678
00:48:51,476 --> 00:48:54,238
[SPEAKER_06]: And he favorited it, and then said, uh, we're all slaves to Nintendo.

679
00:48:57,701 --> 00:48:59,202
[SPEAKER_07]: Valve Hearts Nintendo, confirmed.

680
00:48:59,402 --> 00:49:00,402
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

681
00:49:02,044 --> 00:49:03,505
[SPEAKER_07]: I love Twitter for things like that.

682
00:49:04,325 --> 00:49:05,146
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why Twitter rules.

683
00:49:05,855 --> 00:49:06,516
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

684
00:49:25,044 --> 00:49:32,988
[SPEAKER_07]: Tiger Call in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, what if Valve is like Half-Life 3 exclusive on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 since both consoles have PC hardware?

685
00:49:33,008 --> 00:49:34,328
[SPEAKER_07]: Gabe wouldn't ever let that happen.

686
00:49:35,249 --> 00:49:37,070
[SPEAKER_07]: Gabe would have to be pushed down a flight of stairs.

687
00:49:37,090 --> 00:49:38,650
[SPEAKER_07]: Portal 2 was on PlayStation 3.

688
00:49:39,070 --> 00:49:42,952
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I guess it was on Xbox 2, but it was way better on PlayStation 3 with the Steam integration and all that.

689
00:49:43,032 --> 00:49:44,513
[SPEAKER_02]: It was way better on Steam.

690
00:49:44,953 --> 00:49:45,433
[SPEAKER_07]: That's true.

691
00:49:45,654 --> 00:49:46,494
[SPEAKER_02]: Than anything.

692
00:49:46,634 --> 00:49:59,122
[SPEAKER_07]: I would also think too, honestly, if Steam's got this Steam bot, and I said this on the show before, I said, if they want to sell a million of those Steam boxes, make Half-Life 3 a timed exclusive to those Steam boxes and watch that shit sell.

693
00:49:59,142 --> 00:50:01,644
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, that's all they'd have to do, right?

694
00:50:01,664 --> 00:50:02,684
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

695
00:50:03,465 --> 00:50:04,465
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, anyhow, let's move on.

696
00:50:04,485 --> 00:50:05,326
[SPEAKER_07]: More news, DarkSakura.

697
00:50:05,652 --> 00:50:12,595
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, in other news, you know how we all complain about GameStop, the evil G, as we have been calling it.

698
00:50:13,335 --> 00:50:19,297
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, the federal judge in Camden, New Jersey said, yeah, you can sue them, go for it.

699
00:50:19,957 --> 00:50:31,642
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically saying that the games that were being sold there did not fully advertise that there might be other costs involved, like for online passes.

700
00:50:33,062 --> 00:50:39,948
[SPEAKER_02]: Which, honestly, I think the lawsuit is a little bit on the frivolous side, because it is common sense.

701
00:50:40,068 --> 00:50:46,032
[SPEAKER_02]: However, to quote a Deadpool meme, common sense, so rare it's a superpower?

702
00:50:46,793 --> 00:50:46,993
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

703
00:50:47,733 --> 00:50:56,220
[SPEAKER_02]: So, because these people lack common sense, and other people agree that they shouldn't have to have common sense, GameStop is being sued.

704
00:50:57,955 --> 00:51:12,140
[SPEAKER_06]: If someone's grandma wants to get 8-year-old Timmy Modern Warfare 3 and she's trying to get herself a deal and buys it and then she gives it to him thinking that it's new or he thinks it's new and it's used and now he can't play online, she didn't know.

705
00:51:12,180 --> 00:51:13,841
[SPEAKER_06]: There wasn't a sticker on it.

706
00:51:14,841 --> 00:51:16,962
[SPEAKER_06]: It's for people buying games that don't play games.

707
00:51:17,222 --> 00:51:22,964
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's still, though, it's technically... I mean, this is a decision for the publishers.

708
00:51:23,344 --> 00:51:24,884
[SPEAKER_03]: Technically, the game is complete.

709
00:51:24,924 --> 00:51:32,006
[SPEAKER_03]: You can play the game, and sometimes even a portion of the multiplayer, but it's additional DLC that you need to purchase.

710
00:51:35,667 --> 00:51:40,568
[SPEAKER_03]: Even though it's kind of sad, is when they did this lawsuit, that now it's already fixed.

711
00:51:41,309 --> 00:51:42,709
[SPEAKER_03]: The problem is already gone, so...

712
00:51:44,552 --> 00:51:48,916
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think it's GameStop's decision.

713
00:51:49,056 --> 00:51:53,660
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think they should have to be responsible for something that the publisher does.

714
00:51:54,621 --> 00:51:58,324
[SPEAKER_07]: Which is ironic because EA has now said that they're doing away with online pass.

715
00:51:58,344 --> 00:51:59,665
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and that's retroactive too.

716
00:51:59,725 --> 00:52:03,228
[SPEAKER_03]: So any of those games that you may buy used, they're gone.

717
00:52:03,308 --> 00:52:08,913
[SPEAKER_07]: But unfortunately, it doesn't really change in the world of lawsuit because there was a window of time when it was the case.

718
00:52:09,153 --> 00:52:16,558
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to say, if I remember correctly, I think these are the same guys that were suing Subway and actually won for the footlongs.

719
00:52:16,578 --> 00:52:16,938
[SPEAKER_03]: Did they win?

720
00:52:16,958 --> 00:52:18,079
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought that hadn't been decided yet.

721
00:52:18,639 --> 00:52:18,999
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.

722
00:52:19,059 --> 00:52:19,520
[SPEAKER_03]: I wasn't sure.

723
00:52:19,980 --> 00:52:25,083
[SPEAKER_03]: But for the footlongs being 11 inches, which, come on.

724
00:52:25,163 --> 00:52:26,885
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you're advertising a footlong sandwich.

725
00:52:26,965 --> 00:52:28,946
[SPEAKER_03]: A foot is fucking 12 inches.

726
00:52:29,306 --> 00:52:42,513
[SPEAKER_07]: That also raises the red flag a little bit, though, that, okay, now we're talking about a serial lawsuit type of individual, and you always kind of have to kind of raise your eyebrow at that, like, potentially abusing the system.

727
00:52:44,133 --> 00:52:51,157
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that it's something that, yeah, it's good to have on your label, but in the end...

728
00:52:54,946 --> 00:53:05,699
[SPEAKER_02]: I think people are looking for excuses to sue the moment somebody is the slightest bit put off that the first thought is sue.

729
00:53:07,301 --> 00:53:08,222
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that

730
00:53:10,808 --> 00:53:16,590
[SPEAKER_02]: It would have been better handled by sending a letter of complaint to the company.

731
00:53:16,970 --> 00:53:17,970
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if they did that.

732
00:53:18,090 --> 00:53:20,511
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I haven't seen anything about that in the article.

733
00:53:21,511 --> 00:53:31,114
[SPEAKER_02]: But they should have, instead of just suing the company, the right step would have been contacting the company and say, Hey...

734
00:53:32,214 --> 00:53:35,958
[SPEAKER_02]: This wasn't on the label, we weren't aware of this, what can you do?

735
00:53:36,218 --> 00:53:54,234
[SPEAKER_02]: If they don't respond, then the next logical step would be Better Business Bureau Then the next logical step may be a lawsuit if they are that displeased But in the end, I really think jumping right to that conclusion is frivolous

736
00:53:54,653 --> 00:53:56,034
[SPEAKER_03]: That might be GameStop's way out of this too.

737
00:54:20,037 --> 00:54:23,959
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't understand why, and no one was forcing them to do that.

738
00:54:24,940 --> 00:54:33,124
[SPEAKER_03]: If anything, if you want to get into it, if anything, I think people should be suing fucking EA for having to pay those online passes and then them shutting the servers down.

739
00:54:34,865 --> 00:54:37,406
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be a little bit more worth merit.

740
00:54:38,207 --> 00:54:41,369
[SPEAKER_03]: Even now, it's just kind of like, okay, well, they're done with that.

741
00:54:41,509 --> 00:54:42,749
[SPEAKER_03]: It's gone, whatever.

742
00:54:43,190 --> 00:54:46,071
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't think GameStops really should be to blame for that stuff.

743
00:54:46,111 --> 00:54:47,372
[SPEAKER_03]: You're buying a used copy.

744
00:54:47,392 --> 00:54:49,473
[SPEAKER_03]: A used copy is not the same as a new copy.

745
00:54:52,920 --> 00:55:17,661
[SPEAKER_07]: anything that you buy used is not going to be of the same quality as a new thing so I think this is going to be thrown out I think that they're not going to win it I actually think they're going to win we'll see didn't we kind of predict that this might happen when we first heard about the online pass in the first place that the consumers would not be educated on it and that this kind of thing would happen I'm almost positive it had to be said

746
00:55:18,098 --> 00:55:23,786
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's two phrases that are going to be going out of, I think, common parlance soon.

747
00:55:24,447 --> 00:55:26,930
[SPEAKER_02]: One of them is, you know, the buyer beware.

748
00:55:27,430 --> 00:55:30,394
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other one's going to be shopper's remorse or buyer's remorse.

749
00:55:30,895 --> 00:55:33,579
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you can just sue now if you're remorseful over your purchase.

750
00:55:34,575 --> 00:55:39,138
[SPEAKER_07]: Dungeon Buster in our chatroom says there are people that still have trouble interpreting ESRB ratings.

751
00:55:39,758 --> 00:55:40,238
[SPEAKER_07]: That's true.

752
00:55:40,379 --> 00:55:42,360
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe the consumer's not going to learn this stuff anytime soon.

753
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:44,261
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why they need to rate them like they do movies.

754
00:55:44,581 --> 00:55:45,522
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I agree with that.

755
00:55:46,302 --> 00:55:51,725
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even think the ESRB is so confusing because it seems pretty, you know, it says what it is for everyone.

756
00:55:52,345 --> 00:55:56,348
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand how that's confusing, but you know... It's not to you and me.

757
00:55:56,528 --> 00:55:58,549
[SPEAKER_03]: At what point, though, I mean, like, I had this thing.

758
00:55:58,609 --> 00:56:02,711
[SPEAKER_03]: I was actually dealing with my library accounts and stuff, and we're talking about Final Fantasy XIV.

759
00:56:02,812 --> 00:56:03,012
[SPEAKER_03]: You know,

760
00:56:03,692 --> 00:56:08,553
[SPEAKER_03]: They're ordering it thinking it's a game that they can rent out or loan out to their customers.

761
00:56:08,673 --> 00:56:15,374
[SPEAKER_03]: Even though on our internal website that they order off of, there's a big fucking banner.

762
00:56:16,514 --> 00:56:18,835
[SPEAKER_03]: It's bold and there's yellow behind it.

763
00:56:18,855 --> 00:56:20,375
[SPEAKER_03]: It says, will not work.

764
00:56:20,835 --> 00:56:27,096
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like MMO, cost money to play, not recommended for renting out.

765
00:56:27,436 --> 00:56:27,876
[SPEAKER_03]: People are stupid.

766
00:56:27,896 --> 00:56:28,516
[SPEAKER_02]: They see Final Fantasy.

767
00:56:28,536 --> 00:56:29,397
[SPEAKER_03]: People will still order that.

768
00:56:29,417 --> 00:56:30,997
[SPEAKER_03]: They're like, I didn't know.

769
00:56:31,397 --> 00:56:33,019
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

770
00:56:48,158 --> 00:56:49,580
[SPEAKER_03]: No amount of changing your logos.

771
00:56:49,620 --> 00:56:51,201
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes parents just don't understand.

772
00:56:51,361 --> 00:56:53,163
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes just parents don't give a shit.

773
00:56:53,343 --> 00:56:53,884
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that's it.

774
00:56:53,984 --> 00:56:56,546
[SPEAKER_03]: Or consumers don't give a shit and they're whatever.

775
00:56:56,927 --> 00:56:58,949
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not going to learn.

776
00:56:59,209 --> 00:57:03,393
[SPEAKER_02]: What it is, and this is, I hate to say it, my mother is a prime example of this.

777
00:57:04,674 --> 00:57:07,237
[SPEAKER_02]: and actually there are psychological studies going behind this.

778
00:57:07,277 --> 00:57:18,851
[SPEAKER_02]: People get comfortable with a certain idea and anything that supports their idea even if it is wrong gives them basically a happy chemical response.

779
00:57:19,291 --> 00:57:21,414
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why there's a lot of stupid Republicans out there.

780
00:57:23,456 --> 00:57:23,676
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

781
00:57:24,497 --> 00:57:25,818
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's why Rush Limbaugh exists then.

782
00:57:28,079 --> 00:57:29,380
[SPEAKER_02]: But it goes either way.

783
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:38,806
[SPEAKER_02]: The moment that something is said that's contrary to this idea that is imprinted into their minds, it of course forms an opposite response.

784
00:57:39,066 --> 00:57:41,967
[SPEAKER_02]: The first instinct is not to listen to it, is to dismiss it.

785
00:57:42,588 --> 00:57:45,029
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if it might save them money in the long run.

786
00:57:45,109 --> 00:57:51,293
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when they go back to suffer the consequences of it, of course, oh, well, nobody told me that's because you have a selective fucking memory.

787
00:57:53,655 --> 00:58:02,860
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, I wanted to go to another comment in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com from ShadowNextChan who says, there was some good GameStop news this week too.

788
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:06,342
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm assuming that's the reprinting of Xenoblade, right?

789
00:58:07,102 --> 00:58:09,323
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, that came across my Twitter, that has to be it.

790
00:58:09,343 --> 00:58:10,804
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that has to be the good GameStop news.

791
00:58:10,844 --> 00:58:16,167
[SPEAKER_06]: Someone, and I'm sorry if you're in chat and I just blanked on who it was, but someone on my Twitter feed posted...

792
00:58:16,887 --> 00:58:25,555
[SPEAKER_06]: Xenoblade Chronicles used and it was $80 used from GameStop and if they're reprinting it they have to redo that used.

793
00:58:25,955 --> 00:58:29,898
[SPEAKER_06]: I had no idea that the printing was that limited and it should have just been GameStop exclusive.

794
00:58:30,259 --> 00:58:33,241
[SPEAKER_07]: It's weird that they're reprinting it too when the Wii isn't really being pushed right now.

795
00:58:33,261 --> 00:58:36,824
[SPEAKER_07]: It's supposed to be all about the Wii U but I mean... You can play it in the Wii U though, right?

796
00:58:37,345 --> 00:58:44,051
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, of course you can but I wonder if the price has dropped maybe so it's like $20 at this point and it would make a really good, you know...

797
00:58:44,631 --> 00:58:47,772
[SPEAKER_03]: Please, please.

798
00:58:48,072 --> 00:58:53,173
[SPEAKER_03]: Them dropping the price of something that's going for $90 right now, and it's exclusive to them?

799
00:58:53,373 --> 00:58:57,593
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm sure they're totally motivated from competition to drop that price.

800
00:58:58,374 --> 00:58:59,634
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, hell they are.

801
00:58:59,854 --> 00:59:01,274
[SPEAKER_03]: It's probably going to come back at $60.

802
00:59:02,034 --> 00:59:03,815
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, let's move on with some more news.

803
00:59:03,895 --> 00:59:04,155
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki.

804
00:59:04,875 --> 00:59:11,436
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, so, there was a couple bits of information from Microsoft this week about

805
00:59:12,731 --> 00:59:14,212
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

806
00:59:34,541 --> 00:59:43,527
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the reasons why they're doing this is because the Xbox One, for example, is going to allow you to share your gold membership, sort of.

807
00:59:44,948 --> 00:59:49,290
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, the way they're going to do it is you have your console.

808
00:59:49,810 --> 00:59:56,174
[SPEAKER_03]: Only one person or one live account on that console needs to have live gold.

809
00:59:56,474 --> 01:00:00,477
[SPEAKER_03]: So, say I have my family and each one of them has an Xbox Live account.

810
01:00:00,937 --> 01:00:15,099
[SPEAKER_03]: I only need to have Golden for everybody to play online regardless of which account is signed in and then also the same thing like if I go to my friend's house and sign into my account they can also play on Xbox Live with me while I'm over there

811
01:00:16,229 --> 01:00:17,389
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

812
01:00:37,495 --> 01:00:47,775
[SPEAKER_03]: The problem is, it isn't fucking new This is the same shit that you can do right now on the Xbox 360 It's basically, I buy a game online For example, say I bought...

813
01:00:49,102 --> 01:00:50,603
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, an Xbox Live Arcade game.

814
01:00:51,303 --> 01:00:54,684
[SPEAKER_03]: Say I bought Super Street Fighter 2 or something like that.

815
01:00:56,005 --> 01:00:57,425
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have it on my console.

816
01:00:57,685 --> 01:00:58,486
[SPEAKER_03]: I've downloaded it.

817
01:00:59,006 --> 01:00:59,666
[SPEAKER_03]: It's good to go.

818
01:01:00,026 --> 01:01:00,667
[SPEAKER_03]: I can play it.

819
01:01:01,567 --> 01:01:06,549
[SPEAKER_03]: Anybody that's in my family or anybody else, any other account on my console can play that as well.

820
01:01:07,009 --> 01:01:14,172
[SPEAKER_03]: If I go over to Rob's and sign into my account and download the game on his console...

821
01:01:14,932 --> 01:01:15,913
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

822
01:01:36,388 --> 01:01:38,429
[SPEAKER_03]: Game, set, match, or a fucking takeover.

823
01:01:38,670 --> 01:01:40,471
[SPEAKER_03]: You're so fucking stupid.

824
01:01:40,671 --> 01:01:43,513
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't even realize how stupid you are.

825
01:01:43,693 --> 01:01:44,533
[SPEAKER_03]: To be fair.

826
01:01:44,553 --> 01:01:46,114
[SPEAKER_03]: The Xbox Live sharing thing, cool.

827
01:01:46,574 --> 01:01:50,677
[SPEAKER_03]: This game sharing thing, it's the same shit you have now.

828
01:01:50,797 --> 01:01:54,580
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're like, oh my god, I'm going to buy an Xbox One now because it's so amazing.

829
01:01:54,780 --> 01:01:55,880
[SPEAKER_03]: You're so stupid.

830
01:01:56,161 --> 01:01:59,343
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why they're going to be able to sell those consoles because you're so fucking stupid.

831
01:02:00,143 --> 01:02:00,784
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

832
01:02:16,642 --> 01:02:17,002
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

833
01:02:17,723 --> 01:02:18,703
[SPEAKER_03]: Except I said that in my head.

834
01:02:18,743 --> 01:02:21,445
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't actually respond back to him because I'm not going to waste my time doing that.

835
01:02:21,645 --> 01:02:24,006
[SPEAKER_02]: He was all red in the face just going, okay.

836
01:02:24,266 --> 01:02:25,487
[SPEAKER_03]: You couldn't fit it into 140 characters.

837
01:02:25,587 --> 01:02:27,508
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I showed so much restraint.

838
01:02:27,588 --> 01:02:30,009
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to film a YouTube video and all that shit.

839
01:02:30,049 --> 01:02:32,771
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to like, oh, hey, what the hell?

840
01:02:33,371 --> 01:02:36,273
[SPEAKER_03]: BlackMagic, my 360 turned into an Xbox One!

841
01:02:58,209 --> 01:03:09,079
[SPEAKER_07]: for me to, like, say, bring Mass Effect over to your house, and we have to, or, excuse me, go over to your house to install my digital copy of Mass Effect or whatever, and wait for it to download 7 gigs before we play it.

842
01:03:09,459 --> 01:03:12,242
[SPEAKER_07]: But on the Xbox One, we'll be able to play it right away.

843
01:03:12,382 --> 01:03:14,304
[SPEAKER_07]: So it does kind of enhance it a little bit, right?

844
01:03:14,324 --> 01:03:18,447
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, because it would have just been ridiculous if you had to do that, you know, as it is.

845
01:03:18,587 --> 01:03:22,731
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I know, hopefully, they're going to treat the recovering profiles a lot easier, because...

846
01:03:23,672 --> 01:03:24,552
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

847
01:03:45,098 --> 01:03:50,441
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, Actdeft in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, it's been a while since we've had a Loki rage that hard.

848
01:03:50,741 --> 01:03:56,783
[SPEAKER_07]: And Tiger Claw says, Loki ranting and shouting at the Microsoft employee probably would have been like that video of the lady shouting at an Apple store.

849
01:03:56,943 --> 01:03:59,765
[SPEAKER_03]: I seriously thought about doing that, but just to prove myself right, but...

850
01:04:00,585 --> 01:04:01,345
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not worth it.

851
01:04:01,465 --> 01:04:07,626
[SPEAKER_03]: On someone like that that's randomly going through and like actually searching for like Xbox One and commenting on everybody's story.

852
01:04:07,887 --> 01:04:09,487
[SPEAKER_03]: And like I went and read through like his stuff.

853
01:04:09,507 --> 01:04:15,148
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, no, it's not even worth it because this guy's so – he's drank so much of the Microsoft Kool-Aid that there's no getting through this guy.

854
01:04:15,168 --> 01:04:17,208
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm not even going to waste my time.

855
01:04:17,528 --> 01:04:19,629
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you really think the Xbox One is going to be that bad though?

856
01:04:19,649 --> 01:04:24,250
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I've really – I mean I kind of think they've kind of gone back on everything they need to.

857
01:04:24,630 --> 01:04:29,631
[SPEAKER_07]: The only thing that makes the Xbox One at this point is the fact that it's $100 more and has that required Kinect.

858
01:04:30,151 --> 01:04:36,812
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's kind of one of those things where it's like, inevitably, a year and a half after it launches, there will be some type of price drop.

859
01:04:37,413 --> 01:04:39,413
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I will get an Xbox One eventually.

860
01:04:39,433 --> 01:04:41,213
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not saying that the Xbox One's bad.

861
01:04:41,273 --> 01:04:43,094
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just calling out bullshit marketing.

862
01:04:43,214 --> 01:04:44,334
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all I'm calling out.

863
01:04:44,354 --> 01:04:51,075
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if Sony did the exact same thing, if Sony came out and said, you know, like, hey, let's talk about how awesome cloud sharing is.

864
01:04:51,095 --> 01:04:53,556
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a brand new feature that we're bringing to the PlayStation 4.

865
01:04:54,196 --> 01:04:54,917
[SPEAKER_03]: It's never been done before.

866
01:04:54,937 --> 01:04:58,480
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd call them out and I'd be like, fuck you, this has been something that's been available already.

867
01:04:58,881 --> 01:05:00,262
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, something like that.

868
01:05:00,282 --> 01:05:02,204
[SPEAKER_03]: I would do it both ways.

869
01:05:02,284 --> 01:05:05,948
[SPEAKER_03]: Or Nintendo, you know, Nintendo started talking about something ridiculous.

870
01:05:06,388 --> 01:05:11,773
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so it's just, I find it fascinating that they would come out and say that.

871
01:05:11,793 --> 01:05:12,694
[SPEAKER_03]: But I mean, it makes sense.

872
01:05:12,734 --> 01:05:17,739
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course they're going to want to do that because it makes it, and the game sharing thing is just ridiculous.

873
01:05:18,786 --> 01:05:21,510
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, cool, I can sign into my account and play the games I have bought.

874
01:05:21,670 --> 01:05:27,038
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I mean, that's not really sharing, that's more like I'm going to a friend's house and watching a movie that I brought with me or something.

875
01:05:27,279 --> 01:05:29,923
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, any comment from Alan or DarkSakura on this before we move on?

876
01:05:31,606 --> 01:05:50,856
[SPEAKER_06]: I like rants well like I said in chat if they create some sort of mobile mode or travel mode for your account when you sign in it makes the process faster that'd be nice but like Loki said it's still the same shit we have now I hate importing my profile to a different Xbox

877
01:05:51,776 --> 01:05:54,718
[SPEAKER_06]: It takes like 10 minutes, and you have to do it again.

878
01:05:55,238 --> 01:05:57,640
[SPEAKER_06]: When you come back home, you have to re-import your profile.

879
01:05:58,140 --> 01:05:59,041
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awful.

880
01:05:59,161 --> 01:05:59,841
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the thing, though.

881
01:06:00,161 --> 01:06:06,886
[SPEAKER_03]: Going forward, this is probably going to tie in with Xbox One live accounts because you're connecting to their service.

882
01:06:07,286 --> 01:06:08,827
[SPEAKER_03]: It's probably just going to exist in the cloud.

883
01:06:08,847 --> 01:06:16,932
[SPEAKER_03]: You're just going to be signing in like you would sign in on a website, and you're never going to have to download that profile because it's all on the cloud type thing.

884
01:06:16,992 --> 01:06:18,072
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's...

885
01:06:19,193 --> 01:06:33,912
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably gonna improve, you're not gonna have that, you know, I download my, you know, my 10 meg profile for some reason that takes, you know, if I'm downloading any other 10 meg file anywhere, it would be like instantaneous, but oh no, for some reason I'm, I'm...

886
01:06:34,372 --> 01:06:51,603
[SPEAKER_07]: Operating at 24.4 or 28.8 or whatever Going back to the 90s Let me move In the interest of time I'm going to move on I want to talk a little bit about Nintendo Because Nintendo put out one of their Nintendo Directs this week Where they talked about Clarified a few things going on for the rest of the year

887
01:06:51,843 --> 01:07:10,692
[SPEAKER_07]: for the record I think those are a brilliant idea yeah they're they're they're working out really well I love you know and the great thing is they kind of come out of nowhere like you know people people are already saying get ready y'all Apple's gonna do something on September 10th and it's like god that's so far away but when Nintendo Direct so far away yeah it's less than a month it's still it's still a long ways away

888
01:07:11,368 --> 01:07:15,550
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, okay, compared to Nintendo says, all right, there's going to be a Nintendo Direct day after tomorrow.

889
01:07:15,950 --> 01:07:16,731
[SPEAKER_07]: Get up early and watch it.

890
01:07:16,891 --> 01:07:17,231
[SPEAKER_07]: Cool.

891
01:07:17,571 --> 01:07:18,452
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I'm just saying.

892
01:07:18,872 --> 01:07:20,453
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow, they had the Nintendo Direct.

893
01:07:20,813 --> 01:07:22,014
[SPEAKER_07]: Just kind of clarified a few things.

894
01:07:22,074 --> 01:07:24,395
[SPEAKER_07]: No real big bombshells, but just a few things.

895
01:07:24,775 --> 01:07:28,057
[SPEAKER_07]: First off, Sonic Lost World will be coming out October 22nd.

896
01:07:28,077 --> 01:07:31,779
[SPEAKER_07]: They were talking about some kind of functionality between 3DS and Wii U that sounded interesting.

897
01:07:32,639 --> 01:07:51,193
[SPEAKER_07]: Art Academy Sketchpad for Wii U Some details there And kind of looks like you'll be able to post your drawings into Miiverse Which, you know, alright, whatever Which as Miiverse grows, it's kind of nice Looks like some people are doing some crazy shit in there too I think there's a version of it already downloadable Like a little mini version of it

898
01:07:52,313 --> 01:07:55,374
[SPEAKER_07]: Luigi was confirmed as a new Super Smash Bros.

899
01:07:55,414 --> 01:07:58,936
[SPEAKER_07]: character and I was kind of like, isn't that kind of a given?

900
01:07:59,296 --> 01:08:00,776
[SPEAKER_07]: I kind of already thought he was.

901
01:08:01,017 --> 01:08:02,337
[SPEAKER_02]: Is he going to have crazy leg jumping?

902
01:08:02,437 --> 01:08:03,217
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that would be awesome.

903
01:08:03,738 --> 01:08:04,518
[SPEAKER_07]: Did he in the other ones?

904
01:08:04,598 --> 01:08:05,018
[SPEAKER_07]: I think so.

905
01:08:05,198 --> 01:08:07,659
[SPEAKER_02]: I was thinking, you know, if the Mario 2 stuff.

906
01:08:08,786 --> 01:08:13,489
[SPEAKER_06]: They need to announce Mecha Luigi or Demon Death Luigi where he's like a super uber one.

907
01:08:13,909 --> 01:08:14,870
[SPEAKER_07]: Or Waluigi.

908
01:08:15,670 --> 01:08:15,810
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

909
01:08:16,211 --> 01:08:17,291
[SPEAKER_02]: Waluigi's awesome.

910
01:08:17,772 --> 01:08:19,373
[SPEAKER_06]: I have another Nintendo exclusive.

911
01:08:20,053 --> 01:08:22,074
[SPEAKER_06]: The next Zelda game is going to have Ganon in it.

912
01:08:22,494 --> 01:08:23,335
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my god.

913
01:08:24,836 --> 01:08:26,037
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

914
01:08:26,717 --> 01:08:27,257
[SPEAKER_07]: Moving on.

915
01:08:27,538 --> 01:08:29,119
[SPEAKER_07]: Some other things announced in the Nintendo Direct.

916
01:08:29,199 --> 01:08:32,561
[SPEAKER_07]: Rayman Legends Wii U will have Mario and Luigi costumes.

917
01:08:32,621 --> 01:08:37,744
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, they're not going to actually be Mario and Luigi but it's like Rayman wearing the red suspenders and all that.

918
01:08:38,506 --> 01:08:40,949
[SPEAKER_03]: I still found it interesting despite all the drums with this game.

919
01:08:40,969 --> 01:08:49,478
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of think that's one of those things nowadays for any Nintendo-made game that's like, oh, we gotta have fucking some reference to Mario in it.

920
01:08:50,019 --> 01:08:50,680
[SPEAKER_03]: Gotta have it.

921
01:08:51,601 --> 01:08:53,683
[SPEAKER_03]: Even I remember, was it Need for Speed?

922
01:08:54,664 --> 01:08:58,969
[SPEAKER_03]: Most Wandered or something had fucking cars based off of the Mario Kart cars or something.

923
01:08:58,989 --> 01:08:59,469
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just...

924
01:09:01,751 --> 01:09:11,858
[SPEAKER_03]: It's neat, I guess, but when you do it in every single game, when there's an homage to Mario in every goddamn game that's third party, like, what are we going to get in fucking Assassin's Creed, you know?

925
01:09:11,918 --> 01:09:13,900
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we going to have a Mario hat in Assassin's Creed?

926
01:09:13,940 --> 01:09:15,020
[SPEAKER_03]: Or Watch Dogs?

927
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:17,722
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you going to have a Mario hat in Watch Dogs?

928
01:09:17,782 --> 01:09:17,983
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean...

929
01:09:19,924 --> 01:09:25,829
[SPEAKER_07]: They showed some more footage from Wind Waker HD and A Link Between Worlds, and I am so here for A Link Between Worlds.

930
01:09:25,849 --> 01:09:27,891
[SPEAKER_07]: That's like my most anticipated 3DS title right now.

931
01:09:29,132 --> 01:09:31,815
[SPEAKER_07]: Pretty interesting little virtual console tidbit.

932
01:09:32,415 --> 01:09:37,780
[SPEAKER_07]: A game they're going to put out on the 3DS eShop, Summer Carnival 92 Rekka, which is a very...

933
01:09:38,160 --> 01:09:38,540
[SPEAKER_02]: Wrecka?

934
01:09:38,680 --> 01:09:40,241
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, that game's awesome!

935
01:09:40,381 --> 01:09:41,281
[SPEAKER_07]: It's so rare, too.

936
01:09:41,301 --> 01:09:42,101
[SPEAKER_02]: Have I covered it, too?

937
01:09:42,161 --> 01:09:43,142
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I don't know.

938
01:09:43,162 --> 01:09:44,202
[SPEAKER_02]: I might have done Wrecka.

939
01:09:44,422 --> 01:09:44,682
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe.

940
01:09:44,862 --> 01:09:47,003
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a neat game for a NES game.

941
01:09:47,123 --> 01:09:53,386
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, well, yeah, and they actually acknowledged, like, this shit is rare, and now everybody's gonna be able to play it, so that was kinda neat.

942
01:09:53,966 --> 01:09:59,408
[SPEAKER_07]: Some other things they announced for Virtual Console on 3DS, Donkey Kong, Wario Land 3, Super Mario Bros.

943
01:09:59,748 --> 01:10:01,729
[SPEAKER_07]: 3, and Tecmo Bowl, which, you know, kinda...

944
01:10:03,149 --> 01:10:04,329
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

945
01:10:30,194 --> 01:10:30,474
[SPEAKER_07]: Me-Verse

946
01:10:52,396 --> 01:10:53,177
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting.

947
01:10:54,219 --> 01:10:54,559
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

948
01:10:54,579 --> 01:11:00,967
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a weird little last tease, but I kind of like that they're trying to push the boundaries of me versus some different things.

949
01:11:01,047 --> 01:11:06,253
[SPEAKER_07]: But for me, I'm going to be honest, it was one of those things I downloaded it once, I checked it out, I was like, huh, neat.

950
01:11:06,494 --> 01:11:08,176
[SPEAKER_07]: Then I turned it off and I probably won't ever run it again.

951
01:11:09,807 --> 01:11:14,955
[SPEAKER_07]: But for those that are really into sharing the creative stuff they've done in Animal Crossing, it might be kind of cool.

952
01:11:15,436 --> 01:11:17,960
[SPEAKER_07]: So those are some of the highlights of the Nintendo Direct.

953
01:11:18,942 --> 01:11:21,586
[SPEAKER_07]: So please look forward to all those games coming out soon.

954
01:11:22,408 --> 01:11:24,411
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, before we get to release dates, what do you have for us?

955
01:11:25,006 --> 01:11:29,708
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we do have a demo that's finally on the EU Wii U eShop.

956
01:11:30,349 --> 01:11:31,809
[SPEAKER_02]: EU Wii U eShop.

957
01:11:32,210 --> 01:11:33,990
[SPEAKER_02]: Just try saying that three times fast.

958
01:11:34,751 --> 01:11:38,713
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's been on the American Wii U eShop as well.

959
01:11:39,553 --> 01:11:44,536
[SPEAKER_02]: Wonderful 101, which I watched the trailer for last night and...

960
01:11:45,456 --> 01:11:48,118
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, this kind of makes me want a Wii U again.

961
01:11:48,378 --> 01:11:53,622
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, Tank Tank Tank was kind of a tank, but... It's free now.

962
01:11:54,043 --> 01:11:54,243
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

963
01:11:54,383 --> 01:11:59,867
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, this though, and it was done by Hideki Kiyama, who did Beautiful Joe.

964
01:12:00,347 --> 01:12:05,731
[SPEAKER_02]: And it totally looks like the same feel that Beautiful Joe had, which was a fun series of games.

965
01:12:07,513 --> 01:12:10,955
[SPEAKER_02]: So I really, really am excited about this one.

966
01:12:11,696 --> 01:12:12,757
[SPEAKER_02]: It just looked really fun.

967
01:12:13,297 --> 01:12:18,060
[SPEAKER_02]: And it had sort of that Sentai feel to it, you know, because, you know, I like Sentai.

968
01:12:18,781 --> 01:12:22,483
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think this might be the convincing factor.

969
01:12:22,643 --> 01:12:24,865
[SPEAKER_02]: Even Dan was sort of like, oh, that was cool.

970
01:12:25,165 --> 01:12:27,066
[SPEAKER_07]: There are a lot of people pretty excited about this game.

971
01:12:27,126 --> 01:12:28,307
[SPEAKER_07]: So I need to download the demo.

972
01:12:28,327 --> 01:12:29,008
[SPEAKER_07]: I keep forgetting.

973
01:12:29,068 --> 01:12:30,369
[SPEAKER_07]: I got to do that up.

974
01:12:31,029 --> 01:12:33,691
[SPEAKER_07]: I would do that right now, but I need the bandwidth for the show.

975
01:12:33,951 --> 01:12:35,712
[SPEAKER_07]: Remind me to do that later.

976
01:12:36,473 --> 01:12:37,894
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you seen anything about Wonderful 101?

977
01:12:38,234 --> 01:12:40,315
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of people on my Twitter are really excited for it.

978
01:12:40,455 --> 01:12:42,617
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but we're friends with a lot of Nintendo fanboys.

979
01:12:43,597 --> 01:12:44,257
[SPEAKER_07]: Bless their hearts.

980
01:12:44,497 --> 01:12:45,238
[SPEAKER_07]: Bless their hearts.

981
01:12:45,478 --> 01:12:45,758
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

982
01:12:47,899 --> 01:12:54,301
[SPEAKER_07]: To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, kidney.

983
01:12:55,301 --> 01:12:57,062
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's move on to some release dates.

984
01:12:57,422 --> 01:13:01,043
[SPEAKER_07]: Travel around the world and see what games are coming out to a store near you very soon.

985
01:13:01,723 --> 01:13:07,465
[SPEAKER_03]: The Angry Birds trilogy on Wii and Wii U this week because they didn't get them last time around.

986
01:13:08,299 --> 01:13:16,935
[SPEAKER_03]: Payday 2 on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 Phineas and Ferb Quest for Cool Stuff Xbox 360 Wii, Wii U, 3DS and DS

987
01:13:22,492 --> 01:13:31,016
[SPEAKER_03]: And one week from today, Disney Infinity, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, Wii U, and 3DS as well.

988
01:13:31,076 --> 01:13:33,538
[SPEAKER_03]: A whole fucking ton of characters.

989
01:13:33,698 --> 01:13:37,520
[SPEAKER_07]: Any idea what platform I should get it on?

990
01:13:37,560 --> 01:13:42,683
[SPEAKER_07]: Because, you know, like Alan said, we're Twitter friends with a lot of Nintendo fanboys.

991
01:13:43,023 --> 01:13:46,045
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm kind of leaning towards Wii U for that reason so I can play with them.

992
01:13:46,085 --> 01:13:47,166
[SPEAKER_07]: But then I'm like, oh God.

993
01:13:47,206 --> 01:13:49,367
[SPEAKER_07]: But then I think about things like Injustice where the...

994
01:13:49,887 --> 01:13:51,368
[SPEAKER_07]: You're going 360?

995
01:13:51,668 --> 01:13:56,070
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't even know if I'm buying it.

996
01:13:56,811 --> 01:14:00,773
[SPEAKER_06]: If you have a Wii U, then the tablet acts as the ARFID chip reader.

997
01:14:01,293 --> 01:14:01,933
[SPEAKER_06]: Does it though?

998
01:14:02,053 --> 01:14:04,815
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I thought that wasn't being implemented until a patch later on.

999
01:14:04,855 --> 01:14:06,956
[SPEAKER_07]: Although they are talking about the Pokemon Rumble, so...

1000
01:14:07,216 --> 01:14:08,297
[SPEAKER_03]: Skylanders Skylanders

1001
01:14:26,098 --> 01:14:28,539
[SPEAKER_06]: Crystal thing that you put the thing on.

1002
01:14:28,559 --> 01:14:29,780
[SPEAKER_06]: The magic!

1003
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:31,201
[SPEAKER_03]: You need the magic!

1004
01:14:31,341 --> 01:14:34,903
[SPEAKER_06]: If you have a Wii U, just put the action figure on your tablet and it's like, okay, I read it.

1005
01:14:34,943 --> 01:14:35,603
[SPEAKER_06]: You have this character now.

1006
01:14:35,623 --> 01:14:44,189
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one of those features like the IR port on the 3DS or the DS or whatever that they're never going to fucking use except for that Pokemon game.

1007
01:14:44,209 --> 01:14:46,210
[SPEAKER_07]: But you could tap your credit card on it and use that.

1008
01:14:50,442 --> 01:14:52,023
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't kid yourself, that'll be a thing.

1009
01:14:52,444 --> 01:14:54,966
[SPEAKER_06]: When they announced the Pokemon Rumble, is it?

1010
01:14:55,607 --> 01:15:02,814
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, why didn't they announce a new Pokemon Snap with amazing AR tablet camera support?

1011
01:15:02,914 --> 01:15:07,178
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of wish that my son was older so that he would be appreciative of this stuff.

1012
01:15:07,198 --> 01:15:08,079
[SPEAKER_03]: I can get him a Mater.

1013
01:15:09,780 --> 01:15:14,001
[SPEAKER_03]: The problem is to get the Cars playset, it's like $40 for the Cars playset.

1014
01:15:14,521 --> 01:15:16,662
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like $13 for the Mater.

1015
01:15:17,402 --> 01:15:18,723
[SPEAKER_03]: And then Disney Infinity is another $75.

1016
01:15:19,163 --> 01:15:28,086
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm not spending $120 on this stuff just to have a playable Mater.

1017
01:15:28,526 --> 01:15:31,267
[SPEAKER_03]: Besides Saints Row 4.

1018
01:15:32,148 --> 01:15:32,928
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all it's about.

1019
01:15:32,988 --> 01:15:34,209
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm teaching to play Saints Row.

1020
01:15:34,829 --> 01:15:35,249
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell yeah.

1021
01:15:36,434 --> 01:15:37,714
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1022
01:16:01,042 --> 01:16:02,683
[SPEAKER_03]: My son plays Angry Birds.

1023
01:16:03,184 --> 01:16:05,406
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, he can kind of do it.

1024
01:16:05,446 --> 01:16:06,827
[SPEAKER_03]: He three-starred a level the other day.

1025
01:16:07,187 --> 01:16:07,687
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, good job.

1026
01:16:07,707 --> 01:16:10,189
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I was just, wow, that's pretty cool.

1027
01:16:10,209 --> 01:16:18,216
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's a little hard for him to do it on the phone, but he... That's the only game he plays so far, but hey, I'll take anything.

1028
01:16:18,396 --> 01:16:19,276
[SPEAKER_07]: You gotta start somewhere.

1029
01:16:20,037 --> 01:16:22,239
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, well, since I don't have Japanese releases, how about the UK?

1030
01:16:22,259 --> 01:16:22,459
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1031
01:16:23,127 --> 01:16:44,655
[SPEAKER_02]: we have um coming out we have DuckTales Remastered on the 13th um which actually I bought that for Dan the day I got fired which I shouldn't have spent money on but I thought I had a job but he said he came up and said my girl loves me because she got me DuckTales I was like oh I'm gonna barf just think about how much he's gonna love you when you buy him Strider

1032
01:16:48,099 --> 01:16:58,451
[SPEAKER_02]: also coming out is Europa Universalis 4 and then Payday 2 on PC on the 14th also DuckTales Remastered for PS3

1033
01:17:01,258 --> 01:17:05,345
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, just a few more news stories for you guys in the classic game of the week.

1034
01:17:05,365 --> 01:17:07,789
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was a little surprised DarkSakura's picked this week.

1035
01:17:07,889 --> 01:17:09,732
[SPEAKER_07]: Why?

1036
01:17:09,832 --> 01:17:14,559
[SPEAKER_07]: Just because it's one of those games where you're like, oh yeah, you gotta do that at some point.

1037
01:17:16,449 --> 01:17:17,451
[SPEAKER_02]: Xbox 360, Xbox Live, etc.

1038
01:17:33,568 --> 01:17:42,098
[SPEAKER_03]: As previously mentioned before, they are getting rid of Microsoft Points and are going to be converting over to real currency.

1039
01:17:42,778 --> 01:17:46,963
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is supposed to be happening sometime in the fourth quarter, October-ish.

1040
01:17:47,023 --> 01:17:49,506
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's actually going to take place at the end of August.

1041
01:17:49,526 --> 01:17:52,509
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to convert your funds over to real money.

1042
01:17:52,869 --> 01:17:55,152
[SPEAKER_03]: But they're going to release new cards, I believe, in October.

1043
01:17:55,892 --> 01:18:04,658
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're going to come in different nominations of $50, $25, $30, which are actually $3 to $10 cards, and $15.

1044
01:18:05,978 --> 01:18:09,160
[SPEAKER_03]: So those are going to be available around October-ish.

1045
01:18:09,901 --> 01:18:14,504
[SPEAKER_03]: And your Microsoft Point cards will still work until they say they won't.

1046
01:18:15,224 --> 01:18:23,669
[SPEAKER_03]: And the only little bit of small fine print that you have about the points that you have on your account, they must be spent by June of 2015.

1047
01:18:25,490 --> 01:18:27,712
[SPEAKER_03]: So they are giving you two years instead of one year now.

1048
01:18:27,772 --> 01:18:31,276
[SPEAKER_03]: But I mean, honestly, you shouldn't really have that much money sitting on your account.

1049
01:18:32,417 --> 01:18:34,439
[SPEAKER_02]: It means I have to use the card I got for my birthday.

1050
01:18:35,802 --> 01:19:05,050
[SPEAKER_06]: well not necessarily I mean you can you just don't yeah you have two years I mean come on you should be able to spend enough time yeah you got enough time buy a digital copy of Grand Theft Auto 5 buy more rock band songs you know that's what she's gonna do I got the email blast about this from Microsoft and the way the email made it sound like it was happening now it just said with with an upcoming Xbox system update this will take effect it didn't actually have any dates in it

1051
01:19:05,310 --> 01:19:12,114
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the system update from what I'm gathering, because they like to do every single system update because they do a new ban wave before a major game release.

1052
01:19:12,534 --> 01:19:15,836
[SPEAKER_03]: So the next system update I'm betting is going to be right before Grand Theft Auto 5.

1053
01:19:16,516 --> 01:19:18,998
[SPEAKER_03]: And that would be, you know, beginning of September.

1054
01:19:19,618 --> 01:19:21,639
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's when they've mentioned they're going to convert everything over.

1055
01:19:21,679 --> 01:19:22,420
[SPEAKER_03]: So it would make sense.

1056
01:19:22,520 --> 01:19:23,901
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're doing a beta right now for it.

1057
01:19:23,921 --> 01:19:25,301
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's probably very soon.

1058
01:19:26,762 --> 01:19:29,684
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, probably end of August.

1059
01:19:31,683 --> 01:19:37,025
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know how many of y'all are fans of the EverQuest series, but there was quite a bit of news about EverQuest coming out this week.

1060
01:19:37,725 --> 01:19:40,746
[SPEAKER_07]: Some expansions for EverQuest and EverQuest 2.

1061
01:19:41,387 --> 01:19:44,748
[SPEAKER_07]: EverQuest getting a new expansion called Call of the Forsaken.

1062
01:19:44,888 --> 01:19:47,649
[SPEAKER_07]: Guess what number expansion it is for the EverQuest game?

1063
01:19:47,989 --> 01:19:48,469
[SPEAKER_07]: Guess what number?

1064
01:19:48,989 --> 01:19:50,330
[SPEAKER_06]: One.

1065
01:19:50,350 --> 01:19:50,730
[SPEAKER_06]: 37 in a row.

1066
01:19:51,131 --> 01:19:51,571
[SPEAKER_07]: Close.

1067
01:19:52,451 --> 01:19:54,613
[SPEAKER_07]: It is the 20th expansion for EverQuest.

1068
01:19:55,153 --> 01:19:55,674
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you imagine?

1069
01:19:55,894 --> 01:19:57,495
[SPEAKER_07]: How many has World of Warcraft had?

1070
01:19:57,755 --> 01:19:58,035
[SPEAKER_07]: Four?

1071
01:19:58,455 --> 01:19:58,676
[SPEAKER_02]: Five.

1072
01:19:59,116 --> 01:19:59,376
[SPEAKER_02]: Five.

1073
01:19:59,596 --> 01:19:59,796
[SPEAKER_02]: Five.

1074
01:20:00,297 --> 01:20:00,537
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it?

1075
01:20:00,757 --> 01:20:01,337
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, five.

1076
01:20:01,598 --> 01:20:03,779
[SPEAKER_07]: So hopefully a six.

1077
01:20:04,099 --> 01:20:08,122
[SPEAKER_07]: Burning Crusade, Wrath of the Lich King, Cataclysm, Pandaria is a four.

1078
01:20:08,142 --> 01:20:09,023
[SPEAKER_02]: Roll Pandas.

1079
01:20:09,323 --> 01:20:11,544
[SPEAKER_07]: Is a four because Vanilla doesn't count as a expansion.

1080
01:20:11,985 --> 01:20:14,906
[SPEAKER_07]: But we all know a fifth is coming at BlizzCon this year.

1081
01:20:17,168 --> 01:20:18,649
[SPEAKER_02]: How many people have they lost now?

1082
01:20:20,030 --> 01:20:21,110
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going down.

1083
01:20:21,370 --> 01:20:23,751
[SPEAKER_06]: They were at 7.7 as of the last Horde House.

1084
01:20:23,931 --> 01:20:25,112
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1085
01:20:25,132 --> 01:20:28,033
[SPEAKER_07]: But 7.7 is still way more than any other MMO, so we'll see.

1086
01:20:28,593 --> 01:20:30,374
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I don't know.

1087
01:20:30,434 --> 01:20:36,877
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, we could get into a longer discussion on this about how League of Legends has a heck of a lot of people playing that, but it's not really measured the same way.

1088
01:20:36,937 --> 01:20:37,297
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyway.

1089
01:20:37,757 --> 01:20:38,698
[SPEAKER_07]: That's another discussion.

1090
01:20:38,758 --> 01:20:39,418
[SPEAKER_07]: Back to EverQuest.

1091
01:20:40,058 --> 01:20:49,783
[SPEAKER_07]: Call of the Forsaken is the 20th expansion where you will face off against the dragon lady Lendinaria and return peace to the world of Norath as the way these things go.

1092
01:20:50,464 --> 01:20:55,366
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, two shared bank slots, a new heroic adventure system, new gear, new raids.

1093
01:20:55,767 --> 01:21:01,890
[SPEAKER_07]: EverQuest 2 is getting its 10th expansion, Tears of Vashan, a new channeler class coming in with that.

1094
01:21:02,310 --> 01:21:07,594
[SPEAKER_07]: I think one thing that caught a lot of people's attention, though, however, is the news on EverQuest Next.

1095
01:21:08,295 --> 01:21:14,820
[SPEAKER_07]: EverQuest Next was shown, just little tidbits and a website up, but EverQuest Next will have destructible environments.

1096
01:21:15,441 --> 01:21:18,563
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's not like a total sandbox-like playground.

1097
01:21:18,824 --> 01:21:21,446
[SPEAKER_07]: There will be restrictions on what you can and what you can't destroy.

1098
01:21:22,026 --> 01:21:24,128
[SPEAKER_07]: But what I thought about this was that there's this whole other kind of

1099
01:21:25,769 --> 01:21:26,610
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1100
01:21:48,229 --> 01:21:50,590
[SPEAKER_07]: Landmark is the name of what I was thinking of.

1101
01:21:50,851 --> 01:22:00,358
[SPEAKER_07]: You can construct a structure on a plot of land that you claim in the world and then you can sell it in the Player Studios marketplace for use in EverQuest Next.

1102
01:22:02,400 --> 01:22:03,301
[SPEAKER_06]: That's very Second Life.

1103
01:22:03,461 --> 01:22:05,262
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's going to build the gigantic penis first?

1104
01:22:07,464 --> 01:22:09,245
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess I'm assuming these things have to be screened.

1105
01:22:09,766 --> 01:22:11,747
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Rob, not everybody's into penis.

1106
01:22:12,868 --> 01:22:14,009
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, then boobies.

1107
01:22:14,389 --> 01:22:14,669
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1108
01:22:15,390 --> 01:22:22,976
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow, also it should be mentioned that there's also an iOS and Android app happening called EverQuest Worlds.

1109
01:22:23,376 --> 01:22:28,300
[SPEAKER_07]: Quests and minigames that will tie into lore content and rewards in the EverQuest franchise.

1110
01:22:28,340 --> 01:22:30,281
[SPEAKER_07]: That app is free and available now.

1111
01:22:30,762 --> 01:22:33,924
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you're an EverQuest fan, there's a lot going on right now.

1112
01:22:34,845 --> 01:22:35,165
[SPEAKER_07]: Pretty cool.

1113
01:22:38,020 --> 01:22:42,346
[SPEAKER_07]: Teto13811 in our chat says, EverQuest meets Minecraft.

1114
01:22:42,366 --> 01:22:45,249
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's kind of the impression I got from it too, which is kind of cool.

1115
01:22:45,670 --> 01:22:47,112
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, you know, I like the idea of that.

1116
01:22:49,335 --> 01:22:49,855
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.

1117
01:22:52,018 --> 01:22:54,081
[SPEAKER_07]: Trying to see if anybody else is talking about it.

1118
01:22:56,127 --> 01:22:58,508
[SPEAKER_07]: at live.vognetwork.com.

1119
01:22:59,748 --> 01:23:01,849
[SPEAKER_07]: I see some comments on the Microsoft point card thing.

1120
01:23:01,889 --> 01:23:09,951
[SPEAKER_07]: Tigerclaw says, what's going to happen, I think, is Microsoft will replace those points card with the one similar to PlayStation Network where you can buy a $20 or $50 card.

1121
01:23:09,991 --> 01:23:12,271
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I think that's pretty much exactly what's happening.

1122
01:23:12,311 --> 01:23:14,392
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that comment might have come in before you read that.

1123
01:23:14,992 --> 01:23:15,252
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1124
01:23:15,892 --> 01:23:24,755
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow, that does it for the news for Part A, but we can't wrap this up until we take a trip down memory lane.

1125
01:23:26,929 --> 01:23:29,411
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week?

1126
01:23:29,431 --> 01:23:31,032
[SPEAKER_07]: The classic game of the week is Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time.

1127
01:23:45,376 --> 01:23:46,477
[SPEAKER_07]: I told you guys, right?

1128
01:23:46,537 --> 01:23:49,019
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I mean, she has to do it eventually, right?

1129
01:23:49,059 --> 01:23:51,481
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a really obscure deep cut, DarkSakura.

1130
01:23:51,521 --> 01:23:51,801
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?

1131
01:23:53,483 --> 01:23:55,304
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, then we'll do Panorama Cotton again.

1132
01:23:55,324 --> 01:23:56,845
[SPEAKER_02]: Or Emerald Dragon.

1133
01:23:57,206 --> 01:24:00,328
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't do the same game twice, even though you totally did it once.

1134
01:24:00,408 --> 01:24:00,929
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what, Rob?

1135
01:24:00,949 --> 01:24:01,229
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

1136
01:24:01,249 --> 01:24:01,509
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

1137
01:24:01,549 --> 01:24:01,970
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

1138
01:24:02,030 --> 01:24:02,250
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

1139
01:24:04,512 --> 01:24:06,653
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I had to pick this music to start off with.

1140
01:24:06,713 --> 01:24:07,314
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1141
01:24:09,155 --> 01:24:21,599
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, the Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time, also known in Japan as Zeru no Densetsu Toki no Ocarina, is the Nintendo 64 Zelda option, the very first one that came out.

1142
01:24:22,520 --> 01:24:27,921
[SPEAKER_02]: It came out in Japan on November 21st, 1998, and North America November 23rd, and in Europe December 11th, same year.

1143
01:24:29,822 --> 01:24:41,846
[SPEAKER_02]: It was originally developed for the Nintendo 64DD, but instead came out for the Nintendo 64.

1144
01:24:42,827 --> 01:24:49,589
[SPEAKER_02]: So you play as Link, you go through Hyrule, you have a completely open world.

1145
01:24:49,729 --> 01:24:51,850
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, for as small as it was, it was an open world.

1146
01:24:52,783 --> 01:25:14,311
[SPEAKER_02]: and you had to do several different things you time traveled you had to solve different puzzles it's a Zelda game but it was the first of its type I really think it was it had a really good story it was really in-depth it had some very weird stuff going on in it but it didn't have that stupid moon and it didn't have tingle so it was a lot better than Majora's Mask

1147
01:25:16,225 --> 01:25:16,525
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

1148
01:25:17,686 --> 01:25:24,272
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, the Guinness Book of World Records said that Ocarina of Time was the highest rated game ever reviewed.

1149
01:25:25,513 --> 01:25:28,115
[SPEAKER_02]: And this was also for 2008 and 2010, so it gets a lot of love.

1150
01:25:31,558 --> 01:25:57,545
[SPEAKER_02]: there was also some re-releases one of them was Ocarina of Time Master Quest that had the dungeons redone with new puzzles and then the collector's edition which was a port for GameCube we have that I've actually got the gold cartridge for Nintendo 64 which has some fun glitches in it you can do some different fun stuff

1151
01:25:58,149 --> 01:26:11,007
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyway, like I said, roleplay game, had different elements, has a Z targeting that basically lets you lock on to another item so that you can focus on it and kill it easier.

1152
01:26:11,668 --> 01:26:14,712
[SPEAKER_02]: That game did give me some different perspective issues, but...

1153
01:26:15,674 --> 01:26:20,481
[SPEAKER_02]: You also do quests for the NPCs, so it has a slightly MMO quality to it.

1154
01:26:21,062 --> 01:26:22,244
[SPEAKER_02]: Just that RPG element.

1155
01:26:23,125 --> 01:26:27,713
[SPEAKER_02]: And so basically, you have to get the Master Sword, kill Ganon, save Zelda, the end.

1156
01:26:27,933 --> 01:26:28,654
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is typical.

1157
01:26:30,566 --> 01:26:33,347
[SPEAKER_02]: The Japanese version was called Tokino Ocarina GC Ura.

1158
01:26:33,367 --> 01:26:33,407
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

1159
01:26:57,230 --> 01:26:57,851
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

1160
01:26:58,331 --> 01:27:03,474
[SPEAKER_02]: It also, we had other versions that came out with a GBA.

1161
01:27:03,514 --> 01:27:04,915
[SPEAKER_02]: We released A Link to the Past.

1162
01:27:05,795 --> 01:27:07,656
[SPEAKER_02]: You could buy it on Virtual Console.

1163
01:27:08,097 --> 01:27:09,598
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, it was available.

1164
01:27:09,898 --> 01:27:10,198
[SPEAKER_02]: Bless you.

1165
01:27:12,499 --> 01:27:15,102
[SPEAKER_02]: It was available, you know, for a while.

1166
01:27:15,322 --> 01:27:28,175
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, like I said, there was a 64DD version that was planned that was called Ura Zelda, but it was supposed to expand the game outside of the cartridge limits, and that's where that Master Quest came from, which is why the Japanese version was called Ura.

1167
01:27:29,836 --> 01:27:34,581
[SPEAKER_02]: We have the game on the 3DS, which is the game.

1168
01:27:36,210 --> 01:27:43,077
[SPEAKER_02]: and, uh, they probably have a, well, like it's saying here, they've actually fixed up quite a few things that were wrong with it.

1169
01:27:43,778 --> 01:27:45,580
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, the audio was, of course, done by Koji Kondo.

1170
01:27:45,620 --> 01:27:47,542
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob's playing my favorite music in the game right now.

1171
01:27:48,803 --> 01:27:50,025
The, uh, Gerudo Valley.

1172
01:27:55,471 --> 01:28:20,250
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a special love of classical guitar So anyway, yeah, the game is like one of the most loved Nintendo games of all time It's definitely, I would say, probably one of the best that ever came out on the Nintendo 64 So we're just looking at an instant classic when it came out Especially given how pretty it was when it came out And now this is something that's actually important to me

1173
01:28:21,290 --> 01:28:24,973
[SPEAKER_02]: I even remember this because this was actually the first time I heard of Philip Glass.

1174
01:28:25,834 --> 01:28:28,716
[SPEAKER_02]: They compared a lot of Koji Kondo's music in this to Philip Glass.

1175
01:28:29,557 --> 01:28:42,407
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically, this composer came into discussion recently in helping people with autistic meltdowns overcome them by listening to minimalist music.

1176
01:28:43,568 --> 01:28:57,460
[SPEAKER_02]: And it made me think that back when I was playing through this game, if ever I found myself in a situation where I felt overwhelmed, I'd go listen to Zelda music and calm down the same way I listen to Philip Glass and calm down.

1177
01:28:57,941 --> 01:29:05,047
[SPEAKER_02]: So I thought it was very interesting that that stylistic comparison was drawn between the music and that I react to both of them in the same way.

1178
01:29:05,667 --> 01:29:06,248
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was pretty cool.

1179
01:29:07,790 --> 01:29:10,853
[SPEAKER_06]: This was the game that made me go out and buy an N64.

1180
01:29:11,334 --> 01:29:18,643
[SPEAKER_06]: Unpopular opinion time, but I played Mario 64 for about 30 minutes, and I'm like, this is confusing and weird, I don't like it, this is muddy as shit.

1181
01:29:20,165 --> 01:29:23,289
[SPEAKER_06]: I was the age where being a fanboy came to you very easily.

1182
01:29:23,650 --> 01:29:24,090
[SPEAKER_06]: I was what?

1183
01:29:24,130 --> 01:29:24,751
[SPEAKER_06]: What year was this?

1184
01:29:25,572 --> 01:29:26,952
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for watching!

1185
01:29:42,277 --> 01:29:47,463
[SPEAKER_06]: and I bought other N64 games like Ogre Battle 64, Paper Mario, never played them.

1186
01:29:47,923 --> 01:29:48,644
[SPEAKER_06]: Bought them, never played them.

1187
01:29:48,984 --> 01:29:51,747
[SPEAKER_06]: I played Ocarina, beat it, never touched my N64 again.

1188
01:29:51,827 --> 01:30:01,838
[SPEAKER_07]: See, my rabid fanboy thing, which to some extent still kind of holds to this day, is I really resented the transition to 3D and I just always preferred A Link to the Past.

1189
01:30:01,938 --> 01:30:03,139
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I still do to this day.

1190
01:30:03,159 --> 01:30:03,520
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.

1191
01:30:06,022 --> 01:30:11,368
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think this is a bad game, so get off my... It was just not my thing.

1192
01:30:11,388 --> 01:30:13,911
[SPEAKER_07]: I had a really hard time adjusting to the 3D.

1193
01:30:14,071 --> 01:30:19,236
[SPEAKER_03]: Just like with me, my unpopular opinion, I guess, is that I liked Wind Waker better than...

1194
01:30:20,097 --> 01:30:20,778
[SPEAKER_03]: Ocarina of Time

1195
01:30:47,173 --> 01:30:48,754
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just like, why don't they do that?

1196
01:30:49,335 --> 01:30:51,837
[SPEAKER_03]: Why didn't they do something like that?

1197
01:30:52,037 --> 01:30:56,700
[SPEAKER_03]: I would be cool to see them do a remake of Ocarina of Time HD.

1198
01:30:56,961 --> 01:31:01,944
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, not just up-res everything, but recreate the game, redo all the 3D visuals.

1199
01:31:01,984 --> 01:31:05,107
[SPEAKER_02]: What if they did it in the style of Twilight Princess?

1200
01:31:06,463 --> 01:31:08,104
[SPEAKER_03]: See, I didn't really play Twilight Princess.

1201
01:31:08,224 --> 01:31:12,888
[SPEAKER_07]: I bought it, and I didn't really... Twilight Princess was finally when I came around to accept the 3D Zelda.

1202
01:31:13,929 --> 01:31:14,649
[SPEAKER_07]: Twilight Princess was great.

1203
01:31:14,669 --> 01:31:18,112
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a part in this game, Ocarina of Time, that did make me a little emotional, too, at that age.

1204
01:31:18,772 --> 01:31:19,433
[SPEAKER_06]: I was very sad.

1205
01:31:19,993 --> 01:31:24,677
[SPEAKER_06]: The green girl, the little forest girl who has a crush on... Sorry, yeah.

1206
01:31:25,157 --> 01:31:33,921
[SPEAKER_06]: When you are older and you have to find the seven sages that are going to banish Ganon, she's one of them, and there's this scene where now she has to go off and she's never going to see Link again.

1207
01:31:34,322 --> 01:31:38,304
[SPEAKER_06]: And he's older and she's the same age, and you can kind of tell that she has a thing for him.

1208
01:31:39,364 --> 01:31:41,125
[SPEAKER_06]: I just was very, like, I teared up at that.

1209
01:31:41,325 --> 01:31:43,146
[SPEAKER_06]: She was a very sad character for me.

1210
01:31:43,326 --> 01:31:48,609
[SPEAKER_02]: But how many of us that played the game screamed at the owl when you accidentally made him start over?

1211
01:31:49,169 --> 01:31:49,489
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah.

1212
01:31:49,849 --> 01:31:51,130
[SPEAKER_06]: Spam, spam, spam, spam, spam.

1213
01:31:51,310 --> 01:31:52,191
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you hear what I said?

1214
01:31:52,211 --> 01:31:52,251
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1215
01:31:52,511 --> 01:31:52,711
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

1216
01:31:53,632 --> 01:31:54,853
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

1217
01:32:14,994 --> 01:32:17,236
[SPEAKER_02]: And for me, there was just so much stuff in it.

1218
01:32:17,276 --> 01:32:18,777
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I loved the Gerudo.

1219
01:32:19,457 --> 01:32:22,379
[SPEAKER_02]: I loved going around.

1220
01:32:23,240 --> 01:32:31,806
[SPEAKER_02]: And the one level that I really hated doing, though, was the cave that was all spirally.

1221
01:32:31,826 --> 01:32:32,907
[SPEAKER_02]: That was kind of a pain in the butt.

1222
01:32:32,927 --> 01:32:37,630
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, there was also the water dungeon or the ice dungeon in Zelda's Notorious for having ice dungeons where you're like...

1223
01:32:37,830 --> 01:32:38,512
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck.

1224
01:32:38,572 --> 01:32:44,951
[SPEAKER_02]: The water dungeon was actually really fun to me, but it was also probably one of the only levels in that game that made me actually sick.

1225
01:32:46,678 --> 01:32:48,518
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, Ocarina of Time.

1226
01:32:48,858 --> 01:32:49,239
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

1227
01:32:49,499 --> 01:32:58,280
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll even say that to this day, the best way I like to play it is busting out the 64, popping in that gold cartridge and saying, leave me alone.

1228
01:32:58,380 --> 01:32:59,901
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm getting my link on.

1229
01:33:01,641 --> 01:33:02,101
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

1230
01:33:02,541 --> 01:33:03,201
[SPEAKER_07]: There it is, folks.

1231
01:33:03,221 --> 01:33:05,082
[SPEAKER_07]: Your classic game of the week.

1232
01:33:05,822 --> 01:33:08,042
[SPEAKER_07]: Legend of Zelda, the Ocarina of Time.

1233
01:33:08,922 --> 01:33:10,103
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the true, true classics.

1234
01:33:10,403 --> 01:33:12,823
[SPEAKER_07]: Considered by some to be the greatest game of all time.

1235
01:33:13,163 --> 01:33:13,883
[SPEAKER_07]: So, there you go.

1236
01:33:13,903 --> 01:33:16,384
[SPEAKER_02]: If the Guinness Book of World Records said something about it, then...

1237
01:33:18,591 --> 01:33:22,613
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got news on all of that when we come back after a quick break with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1238
01:33:51,297 --> 01:33:57,239
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 515, already in progress.

1239
01:33:57,799 --> 01:34:02,181
[SPEAKER_07]: Tonight is August 11th of 2013 and having a pretty busy show here.

1240
01:34:02,581 --> 01:34:04,181
[SPEAKER_07]: Back after a week off, of course.

1241
01:34:04,301 --> 01:34:12,364
[SPEAKER_07]: We weren't here last week, unfortunately, but getting back in full swing talking about games such as Hotline Miami, which the live listeners heard a couple tracks from the soundtrack.

1242
01:34:13,184 --> 01:34:13,665
[SPEAKER_07]: I like that.

1243
01:34:13,985 --> 01:34:15,105
[SPEAKER_07]: I hadn't heard any of the music yet.

1244
01:34:15,485 --> 01:34:18,506
[SPEAKER_07]: I like the second song a lot more than the first, but that was really good.

1245
01:34:19,006 --> 01:34:19,406
[SPEAKER_07]: I like that.

1246
01:34:19,907 --> 01:34:20,827
[SPEAKER_07]: Good choice, Alan.

1247
01:34:21,127 --> 01:34:21,547
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

1248
01:34:41,681 --> 01:34:42,221
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1249
01:34:58,848 --> 01:34:59,329
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

1250
01:35:16,769 --> 01:35:42,923
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, just today, I taped a spot for a podcast called Game On Epic Slant Press Edition And that's a part of MMORPG.com And a real quick show, it's only about 30-45 minutes, but they were kind enough to have me on today Good guys over there, so I believe that will be up on Monday, so check that out I get to talk a bit about Final Fantasy XIV, and you guys all know I have the other show, Horde House So I got to speak a little bit about some MMOs, they were talking about Rift and some of the other changes going on at Triumph

1251
01:35:43,543 --> 01:35:44,324
[SPEAKER_07]: So that was pretty exciting.

1252
01:35:44,824 --> 01:35:54,631
[SPEAKER_07]: And I guess I should give another plug, because I don't know if I remembered to mention it two weeks ago, but on the last GameBooey.org show, which was about music games, I was on that show.

1253
01:35:54,651 --> 01:35:55,832
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's up on their feed now.

1254
01:35:56,412 --> 01:36:03,417
[SPEAKER_07]: And it might be getting bumped by the time you hear this by their most recent show they did today, which I think they did about GamerX.

1255
01:36:03,798 --> 01:36:05,959
[SPEAKER_07]: But look for the show in their feed about music games.

1256
01:36:05,999 --> 01:36:06,419
[SPEAKER_07]: We had a great time.

1257
01:36:06,440 --> 01:36:07,380
[SPEAKER_07]: It was like a three-hour show.

1258
01:36:08,041 --> 01:36:08,181
[SPEAKER_07]: So...

1259
01:36:08,761 --> 01:36:09,621
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1260
01:36:30,931 --> 01:36:31,232
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura.com

1261
01:36:42,854 --> 01:36:44,175
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the best way to get a hold of me.

1262
01:36:44,395 --> 01:36:48,496
[SPEAKER_02]: D-A-R-K-S-A-K-U-R-A Or you can message me through Tumblr.

1263
01:36:48,516 --> 01:36:49,557
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to say, Tumbles.

1264
01:36:50,037 --> 01:36:51,097
[SPEAKER_02]: I tumble a lot more.

1265
01:36:51,777 --> 01:36:59,500
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Kuro Tsubasa, K-U-R-O-U-T-S-U-B-A-S-A Just think Blackwing.

1266
01:37:00,361 --> 01:37:03,222
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if you message me on the Twitter, I will eventually see it.

1267
01:37:04,522 --> 01:37:06,683
[SPEAKER_07]: And Loki, I don't know, what's the best way for them to get you?

1268
01:37:06,783 --> 01:37:07,063
[SPEAKER_07]: Twitter?

1269
01:37:07,963 --> 01:37:08,684
[SPEAKER_03]: Twitter is fine.

1270
01:37:09,804 --> 01:37:11,805
[SPEAKER_03]: LokiOLR and Twitter.

1271
01:37:14,443 --> 01:37:20,087
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, well, let's get into some rapid-fire news and talk about what else is going on in the gaming world this week.

1272
01:37:20,528 --> 01:37:21,428
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, why don't you start us off?

1273
01:37:21,728 --> 01:37:28,913
[SPEAKER_03]: This isn't the first time games tried something like this, where they put up a really expensive, ridiculous bundle for an upcoming game.

1274
01:37:28,934 --> 01:37:30,675
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they did something like that for Formula 1.

1275
01:37:32,316 --> 01:37:37,460
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was Formula 1 2012, where they actually had a Formula 1 car as part of the bundle.

1276
01:37:37,480 --> 01:37:37,760
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1277
01:37:38,821 --> 01:37:45,465
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, but this is the Saints Row 4, the Super Dangerous Wad Wad Edition, aka the Million Dollar Pack.

1278
01:37:45,926 --> 01:37:51,270
[SPEAKER_03]: It is exactly one million dollars, there is only one available, and it includes the following.

1279
01:37:51,650 --> 01:38:05,160
[SPEAKER_03]: Saints Row 4, the Commander-in-Chief Edition, a Virgin Galactic Space Flight, a full-size replica of the Dubstep Gun, a hostage rescue experience, plastic surgery, spy training day, a personal shopper,

1280
01:38:05,760 --> 01:38:09,882
[SPEAKER_03]: A capsule wardrobe from all the Saints Row stuff.

1281
01:38:10,742 --> 01:38:15,464
[SPEAKER_03]: Seven nights at the Top Royale Suite in Dubai.

1282
01:38:15,804 --> 01:38:17,925
[SPEAKER_07]: And a partridge in a pear tree.

1283
01:38:18,045 --> 01:38:21,147
[SPEAKER_03]: A week for two at the Jefferson Hotel in Washington, D.C.

1284
01:38:21,187 --> 01:38:23,228
[SPEAKER_03]: A first class flight to Washington, D.C.

1285
01:38:23,268 --> 01:38:23,728
[SPEAKER_03]: and Dubai.

1286
01:38:24,208 --> 01:38:32,752
[SPEAKER_03]: A Lamborghini, a new Toyota Prius Plus, a year's insurance, and a year's supercar membership.

1287
01:38:33,232 --> 01:38:37,437
[SPEAKER_03]: All for $1 million, which apparently is not a very good deal because it's very cheap.

1288
01:38:37,998 --> 01:38:44,865
[SPEAKER_03]: But my thing is, though, it's $1 million and they couldn't even bother to throw in the Season Pass DLC.

1289
01:38:44,966 --> 01:38:47,108
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, really?

1290
01:38:48,209 --> 01:38:56,740
[SPEAKER_06]: This reminds me of how, like in WoW, there are players with phenomenal amounts of money that they didn't buy from a gold farmer that they just have in every expansion.

1291
01:38:57,601 --> 01:39:04,150
[SPEAKER_06]: Blizzard has to put in some mount or some treasure thing that costs like 300,000 gold for like the alchemy mount.

1292
01:39:04,550 --> 01:39:05,892
[SPEAKER_06]: You have too much gold there.

1293
01:39:06,813 --> 01:39:07,634
[SPEAKER_06]: Make this thing.

1294
01:39:07,994 --> 01:39:09,355
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what this is, but in real life.

1295
01:39:09,655 --> 01:39:10,536
[SPEAKER_06]: You have too much money.

1296
01:39:11,817 --> 01:39:13,298
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's a money sink for you.

1297
01:39:13,338 --> 01:39:14,159
[SPEAKER_06]: Buy this.

1298
01:39:14,379 --> 01:39:16,840
[SPEAKER_02]: It just reminded me of what I should have done a while before I left.

1299
01:39:17,521 --> 01:39:19,663
[SPEAKER_02]: That was by the time dragon thing.

1300
01:39:19,943 --> 01:39:25,327
[SPEAKER_07]: I think this is one of those stupid things that generates blog headlines across the internet.

1301
01:39:25,367 --> 01:39:26,608
[SPEAKER_07]: And oh, look, it worked.

1302
01:39:27,711 --> 01:39:28,091
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever.

1303
01:39:28,451 --> 01:39:29,052
[SPEAKER_07]: They trollin'.

1304
01:39:29,572 --> 01:39:30,172
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a good troll.

1305
01:39:30,192 --> 01:39:30,612
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

1306
01:39:31,012 --> 01:39:33,173
[SPEAKER_02]: If I had a million dollars, you know what I would do?

1307
01:39:33,733 --> 01:39:36,114
[SPEAKER_02]: I would just buy the Bugatti and leave it alone.

1308
01:39:36,535 --> 01:39:38,215
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, though, it's not really worth it.

1309
01:39:38,335 --> 01:39:44,578
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they've had a few sites that have actually broken down cost-wise, and it ends up being about $600,000 worth of product there.

1310
01:39:45,018 --> 01:39:46,439
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're kind of overspending.

1311
01:39:46,459 --> 01:39:50,400
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you have a million dollars to drop on a game, then you probably don't give a shit about money.

1312
01:39:52,241 --> 01:39:53,241
[SPEAKER_03]: Bill Gates, I'm looking at you.

1313
01:39:53,281 --> 01:39:54,482
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on, you're a Saints Row fan, right?

1314
01:39:54,682 --> 01:40:00,566
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, if I had a million dollars, I'd buy a house and pay my bills.

1315
01:40:00,606 --> 01:40:05,630
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you had so much money that you had extra, like millions of dollars were just like dollar bills.

1316
01:40:05,650 --> 01:40:06,431
[SPEAKER_03]: This is for the 1%.

1317
01:40:08,072 --> 01:40:11,214
[SPEAKER_02]: If I magically became the 1%, I think my brain would explode.

1318
01:40:11,234 --> 01:40:12,035
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't know what to do.

1319
01:40:12,115 --> 01:40:18,520
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're so rich you have no idea how much money exactly you have because the stock market fluctuates so much each day, then this is for you.

1320
01:40:18,820 --> 01:40:20,461
[SPEAKER_06]: When you're so rich, you don't know how much money you have.

1321
01:40:20,521 --> 01:40:22,943
[SPEAKER_07]: If I had a million dollars, I'd invest and make a million more.

1322
01:40:24,983 --> 01:40:25,383
[SPEAKER_07]: Just saying.

1323
01:40:25,644 --> 01:40:29,067
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if I had just one million dollars, I'm not going to buy a fucking game with it.

1324
01:40:29,127 --> 01:40:30,107
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's stupid.

1325
01:40:30,828 --> 01:40:39,996
[SPEAKER_03]: If I had lots and lots of money, like billions of dollars, then yes, I would drop a million dollars on a fucking game because no one thought that they would purchase it and I'd be like, ha, I fucking purchased it.

1326
01:40:40,096 --> 01:40:40,937
[SPEAKER_03]: Next story.

1327
01:40:41,897 --> 01:41:07,264
[SPEAKER_03]: so this is kind of cool news for the Oculus Rift they're actually they have a new chief technical officer and that's coming from John Carmack the co-founder of id of course big fan of VR and now going to be a part of the team to make the Oculus Rift awesome so neat

1328
01:41:08,604 --> 01:41:08,965
[SPEAKER_03]: Saltibet Saltibet

1329
01:41:25,064 --> 01:41:29,308
[SPEAKER_03]: It's basically a website that you go and you sign up and you get fake money.

1330
01:41:29,929 --> 01:41:33,432
[SPEAKER_03]: You bet on PC controlled Mugen fights.

1331
01:41:33,833 --> 01:41:39,598
[SPEAKER_03]: And for those that don't know what Mugen is, it is a basically create your own fighting game type thing.

1332
01:41:39,618 --> 01:41:45,885
[SPEAKER_03]: And so there's characters from Street Fighter, from all the different fighting series you can possibly imagine and a bunch of other made up stuff.

1333
01:41:46,245 --> 01:41:46,926
[SPEAKER_03]: So you get like

1334
01:41:47,946 --> 01:41:57,251
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, this screenshot here, you get a team battle between Popeye and Ash from Evil Dead versus Duck Dodgers and Spawn.

1335
01:41:57,872 --> 01:41:59,032
[SPEAKER_03]: Just weird shit like that.

1336
01:41:59,132 --> 01:42:07,517
[SPEAKER_06]: If it's a character that had a sprite made of it during the Genesis slash SNES era, then that sprite has probably been imported into Mugen and made a character.

1337
01:42:07,597 --> 01:42:12,699
[SPEAKER_03]: I watched a fight that took place versus a Dragon Ball Z character and Fat Albert.

1338
01:42:12,779 --> 01:42:13,420
[SPEAKER_03]: I just watched...

1339
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:15,041
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, hey, hey!

1340
01:42:37,395 --> 01:42:38,937
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, it's kind of fun.

1341
01:42:38,977 --> 01:42:44,344
[SPEAKER_03]: So saltybet.com, you sign up, you get 400 fake dollars, and then you go and you bet.

1342
01:42:44,624 --> 01:42:46,266
[SPEAKER_03]: What a colossal waste of time.

1343
01:42:46,326 --> 01:42:55,738
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd want to watch a Daisy fight for that hidden eye beam attack that the Moogan Daisy has from Mario Kart.

1344
01:42:57,264 --> 01:42:58,966
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd have to see that.

1345
01:42:58,986 --> 01:43:08,695
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, it's funny and they've got like... It's just this Twitch stream that they have and you bet stuff and you can even... They have a chat window and stuff on there and you can check stuff out.

1346
01:43:08,735 --> 01:43:10,336
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's people with a ton of money.

1347
01:43:10,416 --> 01:43:12,919
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, how many fucking hours are you spending on this thing?

1348
01:43:13,339 --> 01:43:13,920
[SPEAKER_03]: It's ridiculous.

1349
01:43:14,440 --> 01:43:16,903
[SPEAKER_03]: And I always bet on the losers apparently because...

1350
01:43:17,804 --> 01:43:28,877
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, how do you pick who's going to win between some random anime chick and this weird screen cap of a soccer player or something like that?

1351
01:43:28,897 --> 01:43:30,459
[SPEAKER_06]: It's conversations you had when you were 10.

1352
01:43:31,300 --> 01:43:34,404
[SPEAKER_06]: I bet that Superman would lose a fight against that one Battletoad.

1353
01:43:35,084 --> 01:43:36,805
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that's what Mugen is, basically.

1354
01:43:37,325 --> 01:43:43,348
[SPEAKER_06]: Once I tried to find Mugen and install it and get some character packs, I couldn't figure out where the hell this thing is.

1355
01:43:43,608 --> 01:43:45,669
[SPEAKER_06]: It's buried on some Japanese forum somewhere.

1356
01:43:45,749 --> 01:43:48,971
[SPEAKER_06]: I just tried to Google, download Mugen, play Mugen, for example.

1357
01:43:48,991 --> 01:43:49,771
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to tell you something.

1358
01:43:50,292 --> 01:43:55,014
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a disc from seven years ago, a CD from seven years ago that has an install of Mugen on it.

1359
01:43:55,274 --> 01:43:56,536
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know who these characters are.

1360
01:43:56,556 --> 01:43:59,459
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I know who one of these characters is, but I don't know who both these characters are.

1361
01:43:59,499 --> 01:44:01,781
[SPEAKER_07]: But right now... Are you salty betting during the show?

1362
01:44:01,861 --> 01:44:05,826
[SPEAKER_03]: No, right now they have... It's Fox McCloud versus Hawkage.

1363
01:44:05,846 --> 01:44:08,208
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess he's from... Looks like Naruto.

1364
01:44:08,308 --> 01:44:09,670
[SPEAKER_02]: So... Takagi?

1365
01:44:10,236 --> 01:44:11,057
[SPEAKER_03]: Hakage, I guess.

1366
01:44:11,117 --> 01:44:13,498
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I can't fucking read Japanese today.

1367
01:44:14,599 --> 01:44:16,580
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's Fox McCloud versus Hakage.

1368
01:44:16,621 --> 01:44:17,401
[SPEAKER_02]: Good for Fox McCloud.

1369
01:44:17,481 --> 01:44:20,483
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, Fox McCloud is definitely favored to win.

1370
01:44:21,444 --> 01:44:24,446
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, just an example of some of the matchups you see right there.

1371
01:44:25,126 --> 01:44:28,489
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, I had it on the other day while I was doing other things and I thought it was funny.

1372
01:44:29,269 --> 01:44:47,600
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, let's move on Earlier in the show, I was yelled at in private message by my good pal Shane Alinko When I said that I was most looking forward to on the 3DS the Link Between Two Worlds Zelda remake Because he said, how dare you, Pokemon X and Y still isn't out

1373
01:44:48,340 --> 01:44:49,081
[SPEAKER_07]: So fine.

1374
01:44:49,141 --> 01:44:49,881
[SPEAKER_07]: Here you go, Shane.

1375
01:44:49,901 --> 01:44:52,723
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's a Pokemon X and Y story for me to butcher.

1376
01:44:53,263 --> 01:44:56,105
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's about something you were expressing to me earlier this week.

1377
01:44:56,606 --> 01:44:58,147
[SPEAKER_07]: Mega evolutions.

1378
01:44:58,787 --> 01:44:59,107
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

1379
01:44:59,127 --> 01:45:05,532
[SPEAKER_07]: The Pokemon Company unveiled more information on mega evolutions such as Mewtwo.

1380
01:45:06,192 --> 01:45:10,355
[SPEAKER_07]: It can undergo this change during battle, but the effects would only last for the duration of the battle.

1381
01:45:11,216 --> 01:45:19,749
[SPEAKER_07]: In order for this to happen, Pokemon has to hold a Mega Stone item, but there are different ones unique to different creatures in order to get these abilities.

1382
01:45:20,370 --> 01:45:25,518
[SPEAKER_07]: There were also new screens and there was a new trailer that was released for this that talks about how to use this.

1383
01:45:26,419 --> 01:45:26,779
[SPEAKER_07]: What is this?

1384
01:45:26,859 --> 01:45:39,162
[SPEAKER_07]: Super Training is also a thing where you can increase a Pokemon's base stats by playing mini games such as a soccer style game and core training workouts as well that will allow your Pokemon to slowly improve their stats on their own.

1385
01:45:39,582 --> 01:45:43,543
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to hear more about the fashion shoots and all that kind of crap that they're going to have in the game.

1386
01:45:43,683 --> 01:45:49,905
[SPEAKER_06]: And when this story was announced, all of the Pokemon theory crafters and min-maxers simultaneously got a boner and an aneurysm.

1387
01:45:51,725 --> 01:45:53,706
[SPEAKER_02]: Actdeft says Digimon will sue.

1388
01:45:55,356 --> 01:46:23,159
[SPEAKER_07]: Pokemon min-maxers are crazy it's one of the reasons I can't get into Pokemon as much as some people like Shane is that there's too fucking much like it's just like oh my god it's like I gotta do this and then I gotta get these items and I gotta min-max this and I gotta do a fucking fashion shoot on the side like god damn you know what I was fine with 151 Pokemon I was fine with taking their pictures and snap yeah that was fun

1389
01:46:23,726 --> 01:46:25,147
[SPEAKER_02]: The rest of this shit is too much.

1390
01:46:25,528 --> 01:46:25,768
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1391
01:46:26,148 --> 01:46:30,352
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, okay, I did get some free plushies at E3, which I gave to Julie.

1392
01:46:30,973 --> 01:46:31,813
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know what?

1393
01:46:32,454 --> 01:46:32,614
[SPEAKER_02]: Shane?

1394
01:46:32,634 --> 01:46:32,794
[SPEAKER_02]: Done.

1395
01:46:32,814 --> 01:46:33,715
[SPEAKER_02]: Shane does have a career.

1396
01:46:33,735 --> 01:46:36,137
[SPEAKER_07]: The new buddy Pokemon is super cute, by the way.

1397
01:46:36,177 --> 01:46:37,718
[SPEAKER_07]: He's super derpy, and I love it.

1398
01:46:37,759 --> 01:46:38,219
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait, come on.

1399
01:46:38,239 --> 01:46:39,220
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to see the derpiness.

1400
01:46:39,280 --> 01:46:39,760
[SPEAKER_07]: Come on.

1401
01:46:40,261 --> 01:46:40,461
[SPEAKER_07]: Load.

1402
01:46:40,481 --> 01:46:41,122
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm trying to get to load studio.

1403
01:46:41,142 --> 01:46:44,785
[SPEAKER_02]: Although, I do like when people do memes with the old... Okay, that looks like a derp.

1404
01:46:45,125 --> 01:46:46,026
Okay.

1405
01:46:46,386 --> 01:46:47,346
[SPEAKER_07]: Isn't he adorable, though?

1406
01:46:48,546 --> 01:46:49,727
[SPEAKER_07]: What is up with those ears?

1407
01:46:50,167 --> 01:46:53,567
[SPEAKER_07]: He's kind of like the... What's the one they have all the memes about?

1408
01:46:54,648 --> 01:46:55,928
[SPEAKER_02]: Psyduck?

1409
01:46:56,488 --> 01:46:57,168
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

1410
01:46:57,708 --> 01:46:58,928
[SPEAKER_06]: The beaver-looking one.

1411
01:46:58,988 --> 01:46:59,408
[SPEAKER_06]: Bidoof.

1412
01:46:59,749 --> 01:47:00,289
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Bidoof.

1413
01:47:00,429 --> 01:47:01,849
[SPEAKER_02]: What the fuck is a Bidoof?

1414
01:47:01,929 --> 01:47:02,529
[SPEAKER_06]: Squirtle, help.

1415
01:47:02,569 --> 01:47:03,229
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm on fire.

1416
01:47:03,889 --> 01:47:04,529
[SPEAKER_06]: LOL, Bidoof.

1417
01:47:05,130 --> 01:47:06,030
[SPEAKER_06]: Squirtle, I'm dying.

1418
01:47:06,970 --> 01:47:08,110
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't seen those.

1419
01:47:09,910 --> 01:47:10,170
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1420
01:47:11,111 --> 01:47:12,811
[SPEAKER_02]: I just like the Diglett memes.

1421
01:47:13,722 --> 01:47:15,564
[SPEAKER_07]: Far too much Pokemon content for one show.

1422
01:47:15,664 --> 01:47:16,164
[SPEAKER_07]: Shut it down.

1423
01:47:17,765 --> 01:47:20,847
[SPEAKER_07]: Hearthstone is Blizzard's free-to-play card game.

1424
01:47:21,568 --> 01:47:27,772
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be in beta soon, and they're saying it's not really around the corner, but it's not far away either.

1425
01:47:28,153 --> 01:47:36,619
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure what the hell that's supposed to mean, but they're saying, here's the quote about it, "...we're not days away from launching the beta, but we're not months away either."

1426
01:47:37,159 --> 01:47:37,900
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for watching!

1427
01:47:55,234 --> 01:48:22,161
[SPEAKER_07]: for Saints Row 4 even I'm excited about this game honestly I gotta get it at some point the soundtrack list has been revealed 109 tracks in this game good lord I am not gonna read all 109 songs off of this list but I will just point out especially because there's like a lot of classical songs because they have the classical station but I will point out I was very excited to see Hathaway What Is Love is in the game and apparently it's one of those songs that's used at a key moment baby don't hurt me

1428
01:48:22,942 --> 01:48:25,624
[SPEAKER_07]: Opposites Attract by Paula Abdul Dude, the safety dance!

1429
01:48:27,966 --> 01:48:44,382
[SPEAKER_07]: Montel Jordan, this is how we do it I just laughed because Oh Shit's in it Lump by Pusa Oh Shit is in it Obviously the mix station is going to be the best Alright, there you go, Saints Row 4 soundtrack More information there DarkSakura, how about you?

1430
01:48:44,483 --> 01:48:44,823
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you got?

1431
01:48:45,587 --> 01:48:46,988
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, well, I have some stuff.

1432
01:48:47,809 --> 01:48:53,452
[SPEAKER_02]: We have, first of all, there is a Tomb Raider sequel that has been confirmed by the Square CEO.

1433
01:48:54,253 --> 01:48:58,936
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, at least the American slash European Phil Rogers CEO.

1434
01:49:00,116 --> 01:49:05,059
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, they're also going to be doing a comic book that is a bridge between the games.

1435
01:49:05,780 --> 01:49:08,982
[SPEAKER_02]: And I knew about this because Gail Simone actually said something about it.

1436
01:49:09,042 --> 01:49:10,003
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I follow her Tumblr.

1437
01:49:11,804 --> 01:49:13,624
[SPEAKER_02]: She sort of let that slip early.

1438
01:49:14,365 --> 01:49:18,507
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm looking forward to that because I have liked what I've played so far of Tomb Raider.

1439
01:49:18,607 --> 01:49:19,867
[SPEAKER_02]: I just need to play more of it.

1440
01:49:20,888 --> 01:49:23,209
[SPEAKER_07]: Or as we call it here at OLR, Girl.

1441
01:49:23,369 --> 01:49:23,649
[SPEAKER_02]: Girl.

1442
01:49:25,290 --> 01:49:29,532
[SPEAKER_02]: Lara Croft's incredible, no good, very bad day.

1443
01:49:29,712 --> 01:49:30,813
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever that book was called.

1444
01:49:32,671 --> 01:49:58,947
[SPEAKER_02]: and then there is a fan petition out for Smash Brothers and they want to make Reggie Fils-Aimé a playable character yep, you can sign the Nintendo and that he uses Nintendo controllers and characters to his advantage as attacks and they are basically encouraging Twitter users to basically message Masahiro Sakurai to have Reggie in the game

1445
01:49:59,201 --> 01:50:00,042
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that'd be awesome.

1446
01:50:00,482 --> 01:50:01,343
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be pretty sweet.

1447
01:50:01,443 --> 01:50:08,908
[SPEAKER_02]: He has to have... You remember Norimaro in Marvel Super Heroes?

1448
01:50:09,008 --> 01:50:10,649
[SPEAKER_02]: He was only in the Japanese version.

1449
01:50:10,729 --> 01:50:13,491
[SPEAKER_02]: The comedian who was wearing the boy's uniform.

1450
01:50:13,571 --> 01:50:15,793
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they should do a version like that for Reggie.

1451
01:50:16,033 --> 01:50:20,456
[SPEAKER_02]: With the big head that's super exaggerated features and everything.

1452
01:50:20,516 --> 01:50:21,477
[SPEAKER_02]: His jaw should be in attack.

1453
01:50:21,597 --> 01:50:26,700
[SPEAKER_07]: I kind of agree with 5th Dream in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com LOL fan petition.

1454
01:50:27,681 --> 01:50:28,602
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but it would be funny.

1455
01:50:30,163 --> 01:50:52,471
[SPEAKER_02]: and weirder things have happened by the way Tekken X Street Fighter is still in development they haven't given up and it should be better than Street Fighter X Tekken was so I hate this way these stupid well let me say this from Stan in our chat room because I like this comment too I thought Stan Lee would have been cool in Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 yes yes

1456
01:50:55,425 --> 01:51:07,768
[SPEAKER_02]: So, they're looking, though, with this to build a bigger community for the fighting game fans by combining, not just putting the Tekken fans and the Street Fighter fans together, but really making it one big whole community.

1457
01:51:07,848 --> 01:51:08,908
[SPEAKER_02]: So, we'll see.

1458
01:51:09,308 --> 01:51:12,929
[SPEAKER_02]: As long as it's better than, you know, the Capcom attempt, then I'll be happy.

1459
01:51:14,490 --> 01:51:14,850
[SPEAKER_02]: Ta-da!

1460
01:51:15,210 --> 01:51:17,150
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, there it is, your rapid-fire news.

1461
01:51:17,570 --> 01:51:19,711
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's get to the Fugle question of the week.

1462
01:51:27,876 --> 01:51:31,318
[SPEAKER_07]: Every week we ask a question of our Facebook and Google Plus communities.

1463
01:51:31,879 --> 01:51:41,105
[SPEAKER_07]: But this week was a little different because unfortunately due to some of the other podcasts I was doing and being sick and having to get Jamie tonight because she's without car.

1464
01:51:41,525 --> 01:51:42,386
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, my battery died.

1465
01:51:43,647 --> 01:51:45,788
[SPEAKER_07]: I was not able to prep the show in a timely manner.

1466
01:51:45,908 --> 01:51:49,150
[SPEAKER_07]: So I was like, all right, well, we're not going to have enough time to get decent replies tonight.

1467
01:51:49,551 --> 01:51:57,636
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's mix it up a little bit and do a segment instead that we have not done on Orange Lounge Radio in a very, very long time.

1468
01:51:58,016 --> 01:52:00,777
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a segment we call Ask Orange Lounge.

1469
01:52:01,477 --> 01:52:01,877
[SPEAKER_08]: God.

1470
01:52:06,218 --> 01:52:09,199
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.

1471
01:52:09,679 --> 01:52:12,920
[SPEAKER_07]: What will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?

1472
01:52:13,421 --> 01:52:20,363
[SPEAKER_07]: I bet a lot of people didn't know I usually sing the theme and now they're happy that we don't do this segment a lot anymore.

1473
01:52:22,564 --> 01:52:23,384
[SPEAKER_07]: Made up every time.

1474
01:52:23,544 --> 01:52:24,085
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you believe it?

1475
01:52:24,525 --> 01:52:25,846
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a regular Wayne Brady over here.

1476
01:52:26,287 --> 01:52:29,069
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, let's start with Facebook.

1477
01:52:29,529 --> 01:52:30,950
[SPEAKER_07]: Red the Haze starts us off tonight.

1478
01:52:31,070 --> 01:52:31,931
[SPEAKER_07]: What is a man?

1479
01:52:33,252 --> 01:52:34,773
[SPEAKER_07]: A miserable little pile of secrets.

1480
01:52:35,254 --> 01:52:36,094
[SPEAKER_07]: Weren't you paying attention?

1481
01:52:36,715 --> 01:52:36,935
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1482
01:52:38,256 --> 01:52:41,419
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob himself says, why is there no Loki and Dan show?

1483
01:52:41,479 --> 01:52:42,239
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be epic.

1484
01:52:42,840 --> 01:52:44,121
[SPEAKER_07]: Why isn't there a Loki and Dan show?

1485
01:52:44,141 --> 01:52:46,062
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys should just look at each other and yell for an hour.

1486
01:52:46,082 --> 01:52:46,603
[SPEAKER_07]: It would be fun.

1487
01:52:48,129 --> 01:52:49,110
[SPEAKER_02]: I would leave the house.

1488
01:52:49,951 --> 01:52:51,972
[SPEAKER_02]: You wouldn't see me while the whole thing was going on.

1489
01:52:51,992 --> 01:52:53,093
[SPEAKER_03]: We wouldn't yell at each other.

1490
01:52:53,133 --> 01:52:54,274
[SPEAKER_03]: We'd probably agree a lot.

1491
01:52:54,394 --> 01:52:54,875
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, yeah.

1492
01:52:54,895 --> 01:52:55,655
[SPEAKER_03]: Yell in unison.

1493
01:52:55,755 --> 01:52:58,458
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be the two dudes up in the balcony from the Muppet Show.

1494
01:52:59,278 --> 01:53:00,840
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, that would be awesome.

1495
01:53:00,960 --> 01:53:03,682
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that would be awesome.

1496
01:53:04,062 --> 01:53:04,943
[SPEAKER_03]: Just need to channel that.

1497
01:53:04,983 --> 01:53:05,343
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

1498
01:53:05,403 --> 01:53:08,766
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to make the suggestion to Dan, then, that you do the Grumpy Guy Show.

1499
01:53:09,987 --> 01:53:16,188
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, Hoseo Sumerogawa wants to know, what's the one game you thought you wouldn't enjoy, but you ended up loving?

1500
01:53:16,508 --> 01:53:21,330
[SPEAKER_07]: I only ask because I thought I wasn't going to enjoy Hitman Absolution nearly as much as I am.

1501
01:53:22,030 --> 01:53:24,430
[SPEAKER_07]: The one game you thought you wouldn't enjoy, but you ended up loving.

1502
01:53:24,970 --> 01:53:26,371
[SPEAKER_07]: Easy for me, Mass Effect.

1503
01:53:27,431 --> 01:53:29,471
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd have to say that was one for me too.

1504
01:53:30,151 --> 01:53:31,312
[SPEAKER_02]: And Borderlands 2 actually.

1505
01:53:31,932 --> 01:53:32,332
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it.

1506
01:53:33,729 --> 01:53:35,090
[SPEAKER_07]: Alan, anything you can think of?

1507
01:53:35,351 --> 01:53:35,931
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm blanking.

1508
01:53:35,951 --> 01:53:36,451
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.

1509
01:53:36,512 --> 01:53:36,872
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all right.

1510
01:53:36,892 --> 01:53:37,652
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, anything?

1511
01:53:37,913 --> 01:53:38,353
[SPEAKER_03]: Minecraft.

1512
01:53:38,834 --> 01:53:39,975
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1513
01:53:40,255 --> 01:53:44,839
[SPEAKER_07]: Ronnie B says, if you could design your own game for the Oculus Rift, what would it be like?

1514
01:53:46,700 --> 01:53:48,001
[SPEAKER_07]: It would be like F-Zero.

1515
01:53:52,565 --> 01:53:53,426
[SPEAKER_02]: If I had to do one?

1516
01:53:53,806 --> 01:53:55,148
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1517
01:53:55,388 --> 01:53:56,008
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be...

1518
01:53:59,497 --> 01:54:00,017
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1519
01:54:00,037 --> 01:54:02,738
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to try to think of something really pervy to say.

1520
01:54:03,558 --> 01:54:04,739
[SPEAKER_02]: It'd be like superhero dress up.

1521
01:54:04,759 --> 01:54:07,139
[SPEAKER_07]: There's plenty of perv content already on Oculus Rift.

1522
01:54:07,180 --> 01:54:07,700
[SPEAKER_07]: Anybody else?

1523
01:54:07,780 --> 01:54:07,980
[SPEAKER_07]: Alan?

1524
01:54:08,580 --> 01:54:14,002
[SPEAKER_06]: A game like Rez or what was that fireworks game that was a launch game for the PS2?

1525
01:54:14,462 --> 01:54:14,962
[SPEAKER_07]: Fantavision.

1526
01:54:14,982 --> 01:54:15,602
[SPEAKER_06]: Something like that.

1527
01:54:16,202 --> 01:54:16,543
[SPEAKER_07]: Very good.

1528
01:54:16,563 --> 01:54:17,963
[SPEAKER_02]: Fantavision is a fun game.

1529
01:54:19,084 --> 01:54:23,027
[SPEAKER_07]: Pretty rave drug-induced game on the Oculus Rift.

1530
01:54:23,047 --> 01:54:23,588
[SPEAKER_07]: Wireframe.

1531
01:54:23,948 --> 01:54:24,648
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1532
01:54:24,728 --> 01:54:29,913
[SPEAKER_07]: Ragenator says, Train A is traveling south from Butte, Montana at 78 miles an hour.

1533
01:54:30,373 --> 01:54:33,636
[SPEAKER_07]: Train B is traveling east to PAX East with Cliffy B as a passenger.

1534
01:54:34,116 --> 01:54:38,320
[SPEAKER_07]: How much bacon can Loki eat in one sitting without getting explosive bacon grease diarrhea?

1535
01:54:38,520 --> 01:54:39,721
[SPEAKER_07]: That's disgusting.

1536
01:54:39,921 --> 01:54:41,082
[SPEAKER_06]: He's not doing that in our apartment.

1537
01:54:43,399 --> 01:54:45,800
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't get explosive diarrhea from bacon.

1538
01:54:45,820 --> 01:54:47,781
[SPEAKER_03]: It just ends up getting so heavy.

1539
01:54:47,841 --> 01:54:49,042
[SPEAKER_03]: It depends on how hungry I am.

1540
01:54:49,882 --> 01:54:51,083
[SPEAKER_03]: And how crispy the bacon is.

1541
01:54:51,123 --> 01:54:52,644
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't take the question seriously.

1542
01:54:52,884 --> 01:54:55,906
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really, that is what it comes down to is how crispy the bacon is.

1543
01:54:55,966 --> 01:55:00,068
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if it's not, if it's like all fatty and greasy, then yeah, you can't eat very much of it.

1544
01:55:00,088 --> 01:55:02,209
[SPEAKER_03]: But if it's really crispy, then you can eat a ton of it.

1545
01:55:02,469 --> 01:55:21,088
[SPEAKER_07]: If it's not very crispy, that means it's well lubricated You guys are disgusting Hey, we didn't ask the question That's true, that's true It's Ragenator's fault Ragenator, you're banned Get something to slap him with in the chatroom And I apologize for the Facebook noises I still haven't disabled it Stop being jerks and setting it off

1546
01:55:21,608 --> 01:55:25,330
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, Bobby Blackwolf asking the heavy hitting question here.

1547
01:55:25,890 --> 01:55:32,433
[SPEAKER_07]: With all of the heavy topics that are discussed on OLR throughout the years, there are many questions that one could ask the Lounge of Orange.

1548
01:55:32,513 --> 01:55:37,135
[SPEAKER_07]: Some are philosophical, some are personal, others are about the best ways to roast a ferret.

1549
01:55:37,935 --> 01:55:44,178
[SPEAKER_07]: However, there is one question and one question only that dictates the future of gaming and the revelry of gaming's past.

1550
01:55:44,818 --> 01:55:50,161
[SPEAKER_07]: Why the beep can you not accept that Chrono Trigger and Earthbound are better than Super Metroid?

1551
01:55:51,521 --> 01:55:54,023
[SPEAKER_07]: What is actually a rhetorical question?

1552
01:55:54,043 --> 01:55:59,047
[SPEAKER_07]: Because the only acceptable answer is, you speak the truth, Bobby, and now I accept your conclusion as fact.

1553
01:55:59,127 --> 01:56:01,609
[SPEAKER_07]: It has been written on the internet, and lo, it is true.

1554
01:56:02,210 --> 01:56:02,430
[SPEAKER_07]: Well...

1555
01:56:03,564 --> 01:56:05,065
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, it's pronounced Gith.

1556
01:56:06,507 --> 01:56:07,668
[SPEAKER_02]: Second of all, no.

1557
01:56:08,769 --> 01:56:11,491
[SPEAKER_07]: I've actually prepared an answer for this.

1558
01:56:12,092 --> 01:56:20,079
[SPEAKER_07]: I know the internet's been waiting a long time for me to explain the answer to this, so here's my answer.

1559
01:56:20,839 --> 01:56:21,560
[SPEAKER_07]: Drumroll, please.

1560
01:56:22,200 --> 01:56:22,701
[SPEAKER_07]: Drumroll, please.

1561
01:56:24,683 --> 01:56:26,224
[SPEAKER_07]: Because fuck you, that's why.

1562
01:56:26,644 --> 01:56:27,585
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you and goodnight!

1563
01:56:27,805 --> 01:56:28,886
[SPEAKER_07]: Do-do-do-do-do-do.

1564
01:56:28,906 --> 01:56:29,787
[SPEAKER_07]: Do-do-do-do-do-do.

1565
01:56:34,429 --> 01:56:35,570
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I just... Okay, look.

1566
01:56:36,190 --> 01:56:44,756
[SPEAKER_07]: There's something about the fact that Super Metroid is something that you can play in, like, you know, one sitting and really kind of do, like, the speedruns and collect all the items.

1567
01:56:44,876 --> 01:56:50,059
[SPEAKER_07]: I love the music in Super Metroid, and I don't know how to put my finger on it.

1568
01:56:50,239 --> 01:56:54,562
[SPEAKER_07]: I just fucking love that game, and really, they don't make Metroid games like it anymore.

1569
01:56:54,582 --> 01:56:54,902
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just...

1570
01:56:55,868 --> 01:56:57,549
[SPEAKER_02]: They do make Castlevania games like it.

1571
01:56:58,770 --> 01:56:59,271
[SPEAKER_07]: They do.

1572
01:56:59,411 --> 01:56:59,971
[SPEAKER_07]: They do.

1573
01:57:00,171 --> 01:57:03,414
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't hate Chrono Trigger and I especially don't hate Earthbound.

1574
01:57:03,434 --> 01:57:06,296
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, I got Earthbound on Wii U Virtual Console and it's fun.

1575
01:57:06,436 --> 01:57:07,477
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I found the other day?

1576
01:57:07,997 --> 01:57:08,478
[SPEAKER_02]: Earthbound.

1577
01:57:09,118 --> 01:57:09,579
[SPEAKER_07]: The cartridge.

1578
01:57:09,739 --> 01:57:10,459
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, good times.

1579
01:57:10,479 --> 01:57:10,920
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you play it?

1580
01:57:11,520 --> 01:57:11,901
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, no.

1581
01:57:11,921 --> 01:57:12,721
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

1582
01:57:13,041 --> 01:57:14,583
[SPEAKER_02]: Dan and I were actually playing through Super Mario World.

1583
01:57:14,603 --> 01:57:16,624
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the other game I forgot to say I was playing.

1584
01:57:16,944 --> 01:57:17,865
[SPEAKER_02]: It was to cheer me up.

1585
01:57:17,905 --> 01:57:20,147
[SPEAKER_02]: Dan and I drank wine and played Super Mario World.

1586
01:57:20,458 --> 01:57:22,879
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, three hour show and look how many questions I gotta get through.

1587
01:57:23,620 --> 01:57:27,041
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, Tim Tripp wants to know, why not Zoidberg?

1588
01:57:29,263 --> 01:57:29,543
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

1589
01:57:30,903 --> 01:57:31,944
[SPEAKER_07]: Why not Zoidberg?

1590
01:57:31,964 --> 01:57:32,784
[SPEAKER_07]: You're laughing over there, Loki.

1591
01:57:32,844 --> 01:57:33,745
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that Futurama?

1592
01:57:33,765 --> 01:57:35,246
[SPEAKER_02]: I think so.

1593
01:57:35,786 --> 01:57:37,467
[SPEAKER_02]: Because he sheds his skin and he's gross.

1594
01:57:38,507 --> 01:57:39,728
[SPEAKER_07]: That show got cancelled anyway.

1595
01:57:40,328 --> 01:57:41,249
[SPEAKER_02]: It came back, didn't it?

1596
01:57:41,949 --> 01:57:43,210
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's gone again.

1597
01:57:44,330 --> 01:57:49,053
[SPEAKER_07]: Stan H wants to know, if you were in a Final Fantasy game, what would be your job class?

1598
01:57:51,253 --> 01:57:54,354
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to do a summoner because I want to summon cute little creatures to do my bidding.

1599
01:57:54,454 --> 01:57:55,775
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be Realm.

1600
01:57:56,055 --> 01:58:00,376
[SPEAKER_02]: Where I would draw everything that I want into existence and have them beat the shit out of everybody.

1601
01:58:00,997 --> 01:58:02,357
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's a horde of cute ponies.

1602
01:58:03,057 --> 01:58:04,778
[SPEAKER_02]: Stop, stop, stop.

1603
01:58:04,898 --> 01:58:05,078
[SPEAKER_06]: Alan?

1604
01:58:05,658 --> 01:58:07,539
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd be Saban because he was super hot and built.

1605
01:58:08,719 --> 01:58:09,059
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki?

1606
01:58:09,519 --> 01:58:12,580
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember what the class was in Final Fantasy VI.

1607
01:58:12,640 --> 01:58:13,681
[SPEAKER_03]: It was Edgar.

1608
01:58:13,721 --> 01:58:15,761
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he was an engineer or something like that.

1609
01:58:15,781 --> 01:58:17,642
[SPEAKER_03]: Because he had a fucking chainsaw and that's awesome.

1610
01:58:17,662 --> 01:58:18,262
[SPEAKER_02]: And he had a real gun.

1611
01:58:21,319 --> 01:58:24,361
[SPEAKER_07]: Jeremy, our buddy from Koopa Club, wants to know, do you even lift?

1612
01:58:25,602 --> 01:58:25,842
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

1613
01:58:27,783 --> 01:58:29,905
[SPEAKER_07]: How much can you bench, DarkSakura, who's raising her hand?

1614
01:58:30,245 --> 01:58:31,186
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually don't bench.

1615
01:58:31,246 --> 01:58:34,188
[SPEAKER_02]: I do deadlifts, and I am up to 60 pounds now.

1616
01:58:34,749 --> 01:58:35,349
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

1617
01:58:36,090 --> 01:58:36,730
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, I'm a girl!

1618
01:58:38,332 --> 01:58:39,453
[SPEAKER_07]: That doesn't mean anything.

1619
01:58:40,013 --> 01:58:40,133
[SPEAKER_07]: It's 2013.

1620
01:58:41,604 --> 01:58:50,629
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, but for the most part, for people who don't know, I actually am working into powerlifting because I can't do heavy cardio because of bad joints.

1621
01:58:50,669 --> 01:58:53,371
[SPEAKER_07]: God damn it, Code Man, stop setting off my Facebook.

1622
01:58:54,411 --> 01:59:01,035
[SPEAKER_02]: But I actually do deadlifts, and I'm going to be starting bench pressing and doing other powerlifting, so that was a good question.

1623
01:59:01,656 --> 01:59:08,078
[SPEAKER_03]: I do live lifts, like 30 pounds or 35 pounds of live person that I lift up on a daily basis.

1624
01:59:08,238 --> 01:59:10,498
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to lift this question and throw it out of the show.

1625
01:59:11,759 --> 01:59:12,139
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1626
01:59:12,579 --> 01:59:15,679
[SPEAKER_07]: Renee, also from Koopa Club, wants to know, what's your favorite crepe?

1627
01:59:16,640 --> 01:59:17,100
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, my God.

1628
01:59:17,140 --> 01:59:20,881
[SPEAKER_07]: Those crepes at the cute little place in Japantown.

1629
01:59:21,621 --> 01:59:24,982
[SPEAKER_07]: There's this picture of me on Twitter with a spike from Game Buoy.

1630
01:59:25,522 --> 01:59:26,482
[SPEAKER_07]: And look at the crepes.

1631
01:59:26,602 --> 01:59:28,183
[SPEAKER_07]: Zoom in on the crepes in that picture because they're adorable.

1632
01:59:28,203 --> 01:59:29,623
[SPEAKER_06]: There are crepes that are so cute.

1633
01:59:29,663 --> 01:59:29,743
[SPEAKER_06]: You...

1634
01:59:30,223 --> 01:59:32,666
[SPEAKER_06]: Almost feel bad for wanting to eat it, but you eat it anyway.

1635
01:59:33,066 --> 01:59:39,173
[SPEAKER_07]: I will say, though, as far as savory crepes go, there's a place here in Sacramento called Crepeville that's downtown.

1636
01:59:39,193 --> 01:59:41,416
[SPEAKER_07]: They have this curry crepe that's really good.

1637
01:59:41,856 --> 01:59:43,758
[SPEAKER_02]: Danielle's Crepes in Sacramento.

1638
01:59:43,778 --> 01:59:45,280
[SPEAKER_02]: I was pointing out to you on the way here.

1639
01:59:46,201 --> 01:59:47,923
[SPEAKER_02]: Very, very good chicken crepes.

1640
01:59:48,667 --> 01:59:56,796
[SPEAKER_07]: DeGenerate Johnny says, since Rob often asks this question to every guest on OLR, I'd like to know your answers to the question, what is your favorite game of all time?

1641
01:59:57,097 --> 02:00:01,902
[SPEAKER_07]: Note, if you can't immediately name one game, the closest thing would be your favorite game from your favorite gaming genre.

1642
02:00:02,603 --> 02:00:04,565
[SPEAKER_07]: As addressed earlier in this segment, Super Metroid.

1643
02:00:04,845 --> 02:00:05,306
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura?

1644
02:00:05,466 --> 02:00:06,047
[SPEAKER_02]: Guardian Legend.

1645
02:00:06,667 --> 02:00:07,428
[SPEAKER_02]: Valkyrie Profile.

1646
02:00:07,829 --> 02:00:08,449
[SPEAKER_07]: Grand Theft Auto V.

1647
02:00:12,165 --> 02:00:15,568
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you see the how-to basic video for how to install Grand Theft Auto V?

1648
02:00:17,230 --> 02:00:18,751
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I watched all of his.

1649
02:00:18,891 --> 02:00:20,853
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, we were watching it at lunch.

1650
02:00:20,893 --> 02:00:23,635
[SPEAKER_03]: I was showing my son those videos.

1651
02:00:24,016 --> 02:00:25,917
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, what's he doing?

1652
02:00:25,937 --> 02:00:29,661
[SPEAKER_07]: That's awesome.

1653
02:00:29,781 --> 02:00:37,127
[SPEAKER_07]: Fifth Dream says, for each member of the cast, if you could listen to only one album for the rest of your lives...

1654
02:00:37,808 --> 02:00:38,929
[SPEAKER_07]: What would you pick?

1655
02:00:39,230 --> 02:00:40,591
[SPEAKER_07]: Ooh, this is hard.

1656
02:00:41,272 --> 02:00:42,954
[SPEAKER_07]: One album for the rest of your lives.

1657
02:00:43,014 --> 02:00:43,615
[SPEAKER_07]: What would you pick?

1658
02:00:45,957 --> 02:00:46,118
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyone?

1659
02:00:46,138 --> 02:00:46,518
[SPEAKER_03]: That's easy.

1660
02:00:46,818 --> 02:00:47,279
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, Loki?

1661
02:00:47,579 --> 02:00:51,224
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, just because I was listening to it for about a couple months already.

1662
02:00:51,324 --> 02:00:53,967
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Onamonoguchi, Endless Fantasy.

1663
02:00:54,768 --> 02:00:54,948
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1664
02:00:57,687 --> 02:00:58,167
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure.

1665
02:00:59,007 --> 02:01:01,409
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I know how I want to answer this, but I'm not sure.

1666
02:01:01,789 --> 02:01:12,074
[SPEAKER_06]: I have, okay, it would be between, I can't narrow it down to one, so it would be between Tragic Kingdom by No Doubt or LCD Sound Systems.

1667
02:01:12,275 --> 02:01:15,276
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, I think it's going to be LCD Sound Systems' second album, Sound of Silver.

1668
02:01:15,376 --> 02:01:16,137
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be my album.

1669
02:01:18,418 --> 02:01:23,981
[SPEAKER_07]: Either it would be Alanis Morissette's Jagged Little Pill or Echo Image's CompuPhonic.

1670
02:01:25,023 --> 02:01:25,903
[SPEAKER_07]: No, ABBA.

1671
02:01:27,104 --> 02:01:27,644
[SPEAKER_07]: ABBA Gold.

1672
02:01:27,684 --> 02:01:29,224
[SPEAKER_07]: ABBA Gold, I know, I know.

1673
02:01:29,424 --> 02:01:30,645
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's only one album.

1674
02:01:31,365 --> 02:01:31,745
[SPEAKER_07]: Only one.

1675
02:01:31,905 --> 02:01:34,106
[SPEAKER_02]: I would, for me, I'd probably have to say Pearl Jam's 10.

1676
02:01:35,066 --> 02:01:38,387
[SPEAKER_02]: Because honestly, that is one of the few albums I can listen to all the way through.

1677
02:01:38,927 --> 02:01:42,208
[SPEAKER_02]: Or maybe, what was that Beatles album?

1678
02:01:42,248 --> 02:01:45,429
[SPEAKER_02]: Because now I can see it in my head and I know the name of it.

1679
02:01:45,849 --> 02:01:45,949
[SPEAKER_02]: Not...

1680
02:01:46,169 --> 02:02:09,132
[SPEAKER_02]: Not Abbey Road, it was Revolver, Rubber Soul Rubber Soul, thank you I knew it was one of the R ones I love Revolver and Rubber Soul about equally But I used to own, actually I do again own a copy of Rubber Soul And it's my favorite Beatles album to this day Those were the transitional albums where they went from doing bubblegum pop To like the really weird metaphorical stuff Those were the, yeah Rubber Soul and Revolver both were such good albums

1681
02:02:09,955 --> 02:02:11,816
[SPEAKER_07]: Now we have people in the chatroom giving their answers.

1682
02:02:12,416 --> 02:02:14,056
[SPEAKER_07]: I like Teto's answer, Throwing Copper.

1683
02:02:14,076 --> 02:02:14,917
[SPEAKER_02]: Reginator has a good one.

1684
02:02:15,497 --> 02:02:16,997
[SPEAKER_02]: Metallica's Black Album was really good.

1685
02:02:17,017 --> 02:02:18,638
[SPEAKER_07]: Ooh, Fifth Dream, The Cure with Wish.

1686
02:02:19,138 --> 02:02:20,018
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh, another good one.

1687
02:02:20,038 --> 02:02:20,498
[SPEAKER_07]: Another good one.

1688
02:02:20,538 --> 02:02:21,199
[SPEAKER_07]: Lots of good choices.

1689
02:02:21,439 --> 02:02:22,759
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I would pick for an album?

1690
02:02:23,319 --> 02:02:24,220
[SPEAKER_02]: My iTunes library.

1691
02:02:25,560 --> 02:02:26,880
[SPEAKER_03]: Depends how long I've been alive.

1692
02:02:26,920 --> 02:02:31,862
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if we're talking like, you know, I've been alive for hundreds of years and probably Christmas speed, so I'd kill myself.

1693
02:02:35,970 --> 02:02:42,421
[SPEAKER_07]: GamerGirl says, if Animal Crossing New Leaf really existed, what animal would you be and why?

1694
02:02:43,463 --> 02:02:44,064
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to go last.

1695
02:02:44,574 --> 02:02:45,174
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be human.

1696
02:02:45,995 --> 02:02:47,056
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I'm the main character.

1697
02:02:48,097 --> 02:02:50,078
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm the fucking mayor.

1698
02:02:50,158 --> 02:02:51,779
[SPEAKER_02]: So fuck all of your animals.

1699
02:02:52,039 --> 02:02:57,323
[SPEAKER_02]: I am not going to be a nice dog like what's his face in my town.

1700
02:02:58,004 --> 02:03:04,288
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to hit Ed over the face with a bug net, kick that bitch out of my town, and run it for money.

1701
02:03:05,649 --> 02:03:07,390
[SPEAKER_07]: Alan, you'd be the gay unicorn.

1702
02:03:11,113 --> 02:03:12,354
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd be a

1703
02:03:13,939 --> 02:03:14,659
[SPEAKER_06]: Kazelle.

1704
02:03:17,300 --> 02:03:17,700
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki.

1705
02:03:18,261 --> 02:03:18,701
[SPEAKER_07]: Poacher.

1706
02:03:20,141 --> 02:03:20,902
[SPEAKER_07]: Which one's poacher?

1707
02:03:21,922 --> 02:03:25,323
[SPEAKER_07]: A poacher, as in a hunter that kills the animals.

1708
02:03:25,443 --> 02:03:25,984
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

1709
02:03:27,224 --> 02:03:30,185
[SPEAKER_07]: And my answer is, I would be Tom Nook.

1710
02:03:30,265 --> 02:03:31,066
[SPEAKER_07]: Now give me my money.

1711
02:03:32,628 --> 02:03:33,630
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck no, I have a gun.

1712
02:03:35,292 --> 02:03:38,136
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad none of us said Sahara.

1713
02:03:39,398 --> 02:03:41,181
[SPEAKER_02]: Because Sahara really likes carpet.

1714
02:03:42,483 --> 02:03:45,928
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that the one that's like a boy in the Japanese version?

1715
02:03:46,168 --> 02:03:46,589
[SPEAKER_07]: Gracie.

1716
02:03:46,869 --> 02:03:48,251
[SPEAKER_07]: I would be Gracie, let's be real.

1717
02:03:48,972 --> 02:03:57,096
[SPEAKER_02]: Sahara is the wallpaper and carpet merchant who comes and redoes your house with the most god-awful ugly shit ever that you pay 3,000 bills for.

1718
02:03:57,116 --> 02:03:59,237
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, we got four more on Facebook to get through here.

1719
02:04:00,198 --> 02:04:06,101
[SPEAKER_07]: DJ Melvis, our good pal, says, It's you versus the Grin Reaper in a duel for your life.

1720
02:04:06,641 --> 02:04:08,362
[SPEAKER_07]: You must choose three different games.

1721
02:04:08,902 --> 02:04:13,085
[SPEAKER_07]: One 8-bit console game, one 16-bit console game, and one arcade game.

1722
02:04:13,165 --> 02:04:13,565
[SPEAKER_07]: Open choice.

1723
02:04:14,185 --> 02:04:17,447
[SPEAKER_07]: To have a score battle or timed run against him.

1724
02:04:18,047 --> 02:04:19,428
[SPEAKER_07]: What you bring into the duel?

1725
02:04:20,088 --> 02:04:24,490
[SPEAKER_07]: You got a throwdown with a Grim Reaper, an 8-bit game, a 16-bit game, and an arcade game.

1726
02:04:24,871 --> 02:04:25,911
[SPEAKER_07]: What you bring into the duel?

1727
02:04:26,532 --> 02:04:27,852
[SPEAKER_07]: Ooh, this is a toughie.

1728
02:04:28,052 --> 02:04:29,053
[SPEAKER_02]: I know what my time run would be.

1729
02:04:29,293 --> 02:04:29,573
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1730
02:04:29,793 --> 02:04:32,995
[SPEAKER_02]: I would actually break it into Super Mario Brothers, the first one.

1731
02:04:33,695 --> 02:04:36,997
[SPEAKER_02]: I should not say that about Mario, too, because I'm really fast on speed runs for that game.

1732
02:04:37,898 --> 02:04:42,280
[SPEAKER_02]: My score one would actually be Kirby's Avalanche on Super Nintendo.

1733
02:04:42,320 --> 02:04:42,860
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh, okay.

1734
02:04:43,020 --> 02:04:46,102
[SPEAKER_02]: My arcade one would probably be the first Killer Instinct.

1735
02:04:46,542 --> 02:04:46,843
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

1736
02:04:47,143 --> 02:04:48,044
[SPEAKER_02]: I was really good at it.

1737
02:04:48,104 --> 02:04:48,565
[SPEAKER_07]: Dang.

1738
02:04:48,725 --> 02:04:50,808
[SPEAKER_07]: You didn't even get prepped on that question in advance.

1739
02:04:50,868 --> 02:04:52,009
[SPEAKER_07]: Anybody else want to take a stab at this?

1740
02:04:52,049 --> 02:04:52,690
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't even know.

1741
02:04:52,890 --> 02:04:58,498
[SPEAKER_06]: Anything that I was super awesome at when I was like 12, I'm out of practice with, so I'd be screwed if that was the duel.

1742
02:05:00,941 --> 02:05:01,321
[SPEAKER_06]: Gosh.

1743
02:05:03,344 --> 02:05:09,368
[SPEAKER_06]: Tetris 8-bit game I would pick E.T.

1744
02:05:09,408 --> 02:05:21,276
[SPEAKER_07]: because I was actually fairly decent at that You're going way before 8-bits That's like a 2-bit game Tetris is your 8-bit game Master System or Nintendo And then what's Super Nintendo?

1745
02:05:22,425 --> 02:05:24,808
[SPEAKER_06]: I have lots of points.

1746
02:05:27,630 --> 02:05:29,632
[SPEAKER_06]: Kirby's Superstar.

1747
02:05:30,834 --> 02:05:32,295
[SPEAKER_06]: I dominate that game.

1748
02:05:32,315 --> 02:05:33,016
[SPEAKER_06]: Arcade game.

1749
02:05:36,719 --> 02:05:37,060
[SPEAKER_06]: Klax.

1750
02:05:38,467 --> 02:05:42,009
[SPEAKER_07]: Arcade Game, Easy, DDR 8-bit game Anticipation 16-bit game

1751
02:06:01,929 --> 02:06:29,476
[SPEAKER_03]: you know you think I would say Super Metroid but I think I'm actually going to go with like I'm going to go with Tetris Attack because it was basically Pokemon Puzzle League and I was pretty good at that Loki Dance Dance Revolution, Super Mario Kart and 8-bit that's kind of tough Mario is missing fuck I didn't even play that what the fuck did I play a lot of Contra?

1752
02:06:30,376 --> 02:06:31,717
[SPEAKER_03]: Edgar R. asks, which video game had the worst ending?

1753
02:06:51,328 --> 02:06:53,208
[SPEAKER_06]: Mass Effect 3, Mass Effect 3, Mass Effect 3.

1754
02:06:54,269 --> 02:06:58,490
[SPEAKER_02]: No, because they actually fixed it and made it semi-decent, even if it wasn't great.

1755
02:06:58,750 --> 02:07:03,951
[SPEAKER_07]: How about, like, go back to, like, you know, Ghouls and Ghosts, you know, where it was like, congratulations.

1756
02:07:05,572 --> 02:07:06,432
[SPEAKER_07]: Or was it Ghosts and Goblins?

1757
02:07:06,452 --> 02:07:07,692
[SPEAKER_07]: Excuse me.

1758
02:07:08,633 --> 02:07:09,073
[SPEAKER_07]: You win.

1759
02:07:09,093 --> 02:07:10,413
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to do it all again.

1760
02:07:11,813 --> 02:07:12,433
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, God.

1761
02:07:12,574 --> 02:07:14,194
[SPEAKER_02]: What games had really crappy endings?

1762
02:07:18,197 --> 02:07:18,918
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1763
02:07:19,118 --> 02:07:22,440
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, unless there's like the ones where you die at the end or some shit.

1764
02:07:24,041 --> 02:07:25,042
[SPEAKER_06]: Super controversial.

1765
02:07:25,883 --> 02:07:27,904
[SPEAKER_06]: Final Fantasy VII because shit was not finished.

1766
02:07:28,685 --> 02:07:29,005
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1767
02:07:29,025 --> 02:07:33,488
[SPEAKER_07]: If Final Fantasy VII had come out in the age of the internet, it would have been a Mass Effect 3 debacle.

1768
02:07:33,548 --> 02:07:34,149
[SPEAKER_07]: It really would have.

1769
02:07:35,436 --> 02:07:39,220
[SPEAKER_02]: I probably would actually say the original state of endings for Mass Effect 3.

1770
02:07:40,281 --> 02:07:41,462
[SPEAKER_02]: I did go back and watch them.

1771
02:07:42,103 --> 02:07:45,847
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm very glad I waited to beat the games when the extended cut came out.

1772
02:07:47,509 --> 02:07:52,254
[SPEAKER_02]: Although I do have to say that I really hate that happy ending mod.

1773
02:07:52,574 --> 02:07:53,375
[SPEAKER_02]: It just is not good.

1774
02:07:54,696 --> 02:07:56,038
[SPEAKER_02]: It just doesn't even suit it.

1775
02:07:56,949 --> 02:08:01,832
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, John R. says, Chrono Trigger greater than Metroid, less than Secret of Evermore.

1776
02:08:01,912 --> 02:08:02,873
[SPEAKER_07]: Why fight it, Rob?

1777
02:08:03,273 --> 02:08:05,355
[SPEAKER_07]: We're all right, even Bobby for once.

1778
02:08:07,316 --> 02:08:11,199
[SPEAKER_07]: The only reason I read that and entertained it was the for once part because tee hee.

1779
02:08:11,819 --> 02:08:18,504
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, DarkTetsuya asks, remember OLR presents The Hunt based on Loki's favorite novel, Ready Player One?

1780
02:08:18,784 --> 02:08:20,345
[SPEAKER_07]: Can we find a way to do that again?

1781
02:08:20,665 --> 02:08:25,909
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe expand it beyond classic games to include more geeky stuff so more of our VOG peeps can participate.

1782
02:08:25,929 --> 02:08:26,129
[SPEAKER_07]: All right,

1783
02:08:26,289 --> 02:08:30,610
[SPEAKER_07]: That was kind of like a relay race type of thing using classic games, right?

1784
02:08:30,750 --> 02:08:30,970
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

1785
02:08:30,990 --> 02:08:31,630
[SPEAKER_07]: Some modern games.

1786
02:08:31,670 --> 02:08:32,491
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it would be fun to do again.

1787
02:08:32,511 --> 02:08:44,174
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it would be really cool if we could, you know, because our website, VOG Network, is a social game after all, not to volunteer Bobby for projects because I know he's got his plate full already, but maybe in 2014 that could be some type of thing we look at doing.

1788
02:08:44,334 --> 02:08:44,834
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be fun.

1789
02:08:44,854 --> 02:08:45,454
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be fun.

1790
02:08:46,294 --> 02:09:05,505
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd be down for it by that time maybe the movie will come out who knows I think it would be great especially if we could tie it into a charity thing like everybody has to pony up 10 bucks to participate and like you know half the pot goes to a prize maybe and the other half goes to charity or it all goes to a charity of the participants choosing or something like that I think it would be a really great thing

1791
02:09:06,004 --> 02:09:08,408
[SPEAKER_02]: or it goes to the DarkSakura and needs a job fund.

1792
02:09:10,030 --> 02:09:11,773
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not a registered charity.

1793
02:09:13,876 --> 02:09:15,018
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

1794
02:09:16,300 --> 02:09:16,841
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my gosh.

1795
02:09:16,881 --> 02:09:20,006
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to see if there were any more questions because I thought I heard it beep a couple more times.

1796
02:09:20,647 --> 02:09:21,128
[SPEAKER_07]: Where are we?

1797
02:09:24,395 --> 02:09:25,496
[SPEAKER_07]: One more on Facebook.

1798
02:09:26,797 --> 02:09:30,940
[SPEAKER_07]: Codeman wants to know, if you were to cosplay, what would you cosplay as?

1799
02:09:31,040 --> 02:09:33,361
[SPEAKER_02]: What happens I cosplayed as?

1800
02:09:33,541 --> 02:09:35,243
[SPEAKER_07]: What would you cosplay as now?

1801
02:09:35,443 --> 02:09:37,865
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I can tell you what my next cosplay is going to be.

1802
02:09:38,905 --> 02:09:49,653
[SPEAKER_02]: My friend, Chadi, who I think you might have met, we did a stupid online quiz for Homestuck about what would your god tier be, so we were going to just do our god tier outfits.

1803
02:09:50,734 --> 02:09:52,295
[SPEAKER_02]: Which mine would be the Sylph of Heart.

1804
02:09:53,573 --> 02:09:57,496
[SPEAKER_07]: I need to cosplay as Joker because I got the red beard to pull it off.

1805
02:09:57,736 --> 02:10:01,879
[SPEAKER_07]: So I would think that would be a character I'd resemble pretty well that I could cosplay.

1806
02:10:02,339 --> 02:10:04,521
[SPEAKER_02]: I found tutorials.

1807
02:10:05,122 --> 02:10:05,642
[SPEAKER_02]: Talk to me later.

1808
02:10:05,822 --> 02:10:06,623
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'll have to look into that.

1809
02:10:08,264 --> 02:10:10,145
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, Alan, any interest in cosplaying?

1810
02:10:11,206 --> 02:10:12,047
[SPEAKER_07]: What would you cosplay as?

1811
02:10:13,588 --> 02:10:13,708
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

1812
02:10:15,965 --> 02:10:16,425
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1813
02:10:33,313 --> 02:10:48,944
[SPEAKER_03]: some sort of giant mech thing although then I'd have to learn how to walk on stilts and that sounds dangerous or get one of those costumes that's like the really realistic looking like raptor dinosaur thing because it'd be fun to run around with that shit and I just want that costume.

1814
02:10:48,984 --> 02:10:49,544
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty sweet.

1815
02:10:49,985 --> 02:10:50,965
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a better answer.

1816
02:10:51,466 --> 02:10:51,666
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1817
02:10:51,726 --> 02:10:53,167
[SPEAKER_06]: Or a replacement answer.

1818
02:10:53,667 --> 02:10:54,688
[SPEAKER_06]: Gender swapped ooh la la.

1819
02:10:54,708 --> 02:10:57,830
[SPEAKER_02]: That would actually be really cool.

1820
02:10:58,030 --> 02:10:58,430
[SPEAKER_07]: That's amazing.

1821
02:10:58,531 --> 02:11:01,913
[SPEAKER_07]: I would cosplay as one of the other characters from Do you have like orange vinyl bell bottoms?

1822
02:11:02,033 --> 02:11:02,113
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

1823
02:11:03,069 --> 02:11:03,609
[SPEAKER_07]: That's amazing.

1824
02:11:04,190 --> 02:11:04,470
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1825
02:11:04,870 --> 02:11:13,554
[SPEAKER_07]: Travis over on Google+, the lone Google Plus respondent, says, Hey, Robin Gang, just finished Tomb Raider and was going to start on Deus Ex Human Revolution.

1826
02:11:13,894 --> 02:11:15,655
[SPEAKER_07]: Was wondering what you all thought about each game.

1827
02:11:16,535 --> 02:11:17,515
[SPEAKER_07]: Loved Tomb Raider.

1828
02:11:17,655 --> 02:11:19,796
[SPEAKER_07]: Didn't get a chance to play Deus Ex Human Revolution yet.

1829
02:11:19,816 --> 02:11:23,138
[SPEAKER_07]: You should download it quickly because it is free on the PlayStation Network right now.

1830
02:11:23,198 --> 02:11:23,618
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, is it?

1831
02:11:23,638 --> 02:11:24,558
[SPEAKER_03]: PlayStation Plus, yes.

1832
02:11:24,658 --> 02:11:25,239
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for the tip.

1833
02:11:25,439 --> 02:11:25,939
[SPEAKER_03]: And Hitman.

1834
02:11:25,959 --> 02:11:26,359
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll do that.

1835
02:11:26,379 --> 02:11:28,000
[SPEAKER_07]: Hitman is one they just added, too.

1836
02:11:28,180 --> 02:11:28,820
[SPEAKER_07]: I watched.

1837
02:11:28,840 --> 02:11:32,242
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it was Tim Tripp was playing Hitman, the new one, and it looked pretty neat.

1838
02:11:33,122 --> 02:11:47,155
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks like a game I would be terrible at And Jet Set Radio is on there free as well Good lord I was downloading Hitman today I'm playing Dota 2 right now, I suck at it, but I like it I know you, Rob, have been playing it What do you think about the learning curve of the game?

1839
02:11:47,175 --> 02:11:48,476
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you having as much trouble as me?

1840
02:11:48,856 --> 02:11:56,603
[SPEAKER_07]: Keep up the good work, love you guys Thank you, Travis Yes, I am having as much trouble as you You just have to kind of jump in there and do it I think that's the only way

1841
02:11:57,263 --> 02:12:00,606
[SPEAKER_07]: The good news is Dota 2 has a very robust tutorial system.

1842
02:12:01,006 --> 02:12:07,632
[SPEAKER_07]: I think don't be afraid to do the single lane match over against the bot over and over and over again because it'll help you find a character that you like.

1843
02:12:08,012 --> 02:12:13,857
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I really learned like I do not like playing melee classes, but I like playing ranged classes.

1844
02:12:14,237 --> 02:12:21,222
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the ones I really liked was The Lich because it's basically a parody of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Batman and Robin.

1845
02:12:21,242 --> 02:12:21,543
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1846
02:12:22,443 --> 02:12:46,769
[SPEAKER_07]: chill out everybody freeze like the lich is like that in Dota 2 this is my new favorite character so check that out alright there it is the end of Ask Orange Lounge wow that was lengthy tonight but lots of good questions how could we not do that alright let's do some stories mailbag a few of the week coming up and then twitter topics and the skype line at 1877 game OLR but we have some news first Loki

1847
02:12:46,949 --> 02:12:47,810
[SPEAKER_03]: Game DVR for the Xbox One

1848
02:13:04,722 --> 02:13:05,843
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to laugh.

1849
02:13:07,024 --> 02:13:23,616
[SPEAKER_03]: So IGN did this Ask Microsoft Anything, you know, an AMA thing that they have on Reddit and stuff, except that none of the people that, you know, it says, I'm bringing you a handful of Ask Microsoft Anything answers each Monday at 2 p.m., blah, blah, blah.

1850
02:13:24,657 --> 02:13:30,201
[SPEAKER_03]: But the people that, you know, participated on IGN didn't get to fucking answer any of those questions.

1851
02:13:30,481 --> 02:13:31,862
[SPEAKER_03]: Or ask any of those questions.

1852
02:13:31,922 --> 02:13:33,764
[SPEAKER_03]: It was all shit from IGN.

1853
02:13:33,844 --> 02:13:39,027
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably, you know, stuff that Microsoft said, okay, here's what we're going to give you answers for.

1854
02:13:39,948 --> 02:13:44,311
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyways, so one of those things about, you know, the game capture stuff.

1855
02:13:44,331 --> 02:13:48,034
[SPEAKER_03]: They're saying, will Forza 5 clips capture at 1080p and 60 frames per second?

1856
02:13:48,054 --> 02:13:48,094
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1857
02:13:48,534 --> 02:14:08,889
[SPEAKER_03]: and where can game DVR clips be uploaded to and they're saying game DVR clips capture beautiful 720p 30 frames per second video and I believe it's up to 5 minutes if that was correct one of the things that kind of sucks though is you have to have Xbox Live Gold in order to use that feature so they're locking it behind a paywall

1858
02:14:09,950 --> 02:14:16,215
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, in typical assembly fashion as of late, they responded back on Twitter.

1859
02:14:16,475 --> 02:14:24,821
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is from Shuhei Yoshida, basically saying that, hey, guess what?

1860
02:14:25,982 --> 02:14:26,582
[SPEAKER_03]: The PlayStation 4...

1861
02:14:28,283 --> 02:14:33,928
[SPEAKER_03]: DVR function will record up to 15 minutes of gameplay in the background and won't be behind a paywall.

1862
02:14:33,968 --> 02:14:39,674
[SPEAKER_03]: You do not need PlayStation Plus in order to access the game recordings or streaming functionality.

1863
02:14:40,374 --> 02:14:42,837
[SPEAKER_03]: So, cool.

1864
02:14:44,258 --> 02:14:44,478
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura

1865
02:15:04,005 --> 02:15:04,426
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

1866
02:15:18,672 --> 02:15:36,065
[SPEAKER_03]: I think a lot of people are going to be getting the Xbox One probably already have Xbox Live Gold or will be getting Gold and also now that you only have to have one account per family that has Gold if you're gaming on one system that's not a huge deal but still though it does kind of suck that there's yet another feature behind a paywall.

1867
02:15:36,564 --> 02:15:36,804
[SPEAKER_07]: Bungie

1868
02:15:57,771 --> 02:16:07,217
[SPEAKER_07]: So Chris Butcher, who is a Bungie technical director, was asked in an interview with Edge about, you know, how are you going to address some of these aggressive behaviors people have?

1869
02:16:07,697 --> 02:16:12,861
[SPEAKER_07]: And he's mentioning that the developers are talking about positive social behavior rewarding in these games.

1870
02:16:12,961 --> 02:16:21,266
[SPEAKER_07]: Quote, if you look back at online multiplayer gaming for the last 10 years, the dominant threat has been adolescent males shooting each other in the face and squatting on each other's corpses.

1871
02:16:21,686 --> 02:16:22,547
[SPEAKER_07]: At least they acknowledge it.

1872
02:16:23,067 --> 02:16:24,667
[SPEAKER_07]: That emerges from design decisions.

1873
02:16:24,727 --> 02:16:30,409
[SPEAKER_07]: The community gets attracted towards that, and that is popular to a lot of other people, and so it tends to exclude others.

1874
02:16:31,369 --> 02:16:42,271
[SPEAKER_07]: What they're trying to do is they want to exclude certain in-game gestures and have the game mapping of in-game gestures like waving and dancing to encourage more collaboration and friendliness, less posturing and aggression.

1875
02:16:42,451 --> 02:16:43,131
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's the other quote.

1876
02:16:43,532 --> 02:16:49,993
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think you can ever design toxic behavior out, but what you can do is prevent them being able to ruin other players' experiences.

1877
02:16:50,413 --> 02:16:54,135
[SPEAKER_07]: You give people these tools that encourage them to interact positively with each other.

1878
02:16:54,495 --> 02:16:58,578
[SPEAKER_07]: And then if someone is interacting negatively with you, well, they can't ruin your experience.

1879
02:16:58,758 --> 02:17:00,139
[SPEAKER_03]: Now they can just dance on your corpse.

1880
02:17:00,259 --> 02:17:00,479
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.

1881
02:17:00,719 --> 02:17:08,784
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems a little bit naive to me for a company that's, you know, did... That's just like trying to like say, hey, we're giving you a game where you can draw things, but we're going to ban the dicks.

1882
02:17:09,284 --> 02:17:10,145
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not going to happen.

1883
02:17:10,185 --> 02:17:11,005
[SPEAKER_03]: You're just not...

1884
02:17:13,427 --> 02:17:18,853
[SPEAKER_07]: If all you leave in is a little waving emote, people are going to figure out how to fist each other using the terrain.

1885
02:17:19,354 --> 02:17:20,115
[SPEAKER_07]: That's just the thing.

1886
02:17:20,455 --> 02:17:21,636
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what's going to happen.

1887
02:17:21,676 --> 02:17:22,978
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be whacking off somebody.

1888
02:17:23,038 --> 02:17:23,338
[SPEAKER_07]: Come on.

1889
02:17:26,502 --> 02:17:27,022
[SPEAKER_03]: But we'll see.

1890
02:17:27,202 --> 02:17:30,744
[SPEAKER_03]: You underestimate their ability to create lewd gestures.

1891
02:17:30,784 --> 02:17:32,805
[SPEAKER_07]: But I do think rewarding good behavior is a good thing.

1892
02:17:32,865 --> 02:17:37,867
[SPEAKER_07]: League of Legends does it, and it feels pretty good when I get the little karma point after a match because I was friendly to people.

1893
02:17:38,247 --> 02:17:40,428
[SPEAKER_07]: I really wish WoW would implement a similar system.

1894
02:17:41,408 --> 02:17:45,490
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, yeah, it would be cool if they would reward the good behavior in Destiny, but we'll see.

1895
02:17:45,510 --> 02:17:50,732
[SPEAKER_03]: Just have it where if someone gets killed by somebody else and they try to squat on them, they get launched into space.

1896
02:17:51,432 --> 02:17:52,773
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be funny.

1897
02:17:52,853 --> 02:17:53,673
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be awesome.

1898
02:17:53,733 --> 02:17:55,774
[SPEAKER_02]: And then people would do it on purpose to see what happens.

1899
02:17:55,854 --> 02:17:56,475
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura DarkSakura

1900
02:18:15,683 --> 02:18:21,047
[SPEAKER_02]: There's an ad that Target put out that shows the PS Vita going for $200.

1901
02:18:22,989 --> 02:18:27,773
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically there hasn't been a big announcement on anything like that.

1902
02:18:27,833 --> 02:18:29,114
[SPEAKER_02]: Sony didn't say anything.

1903
02:18:29,554 --> 02:18:32,116
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's in a Target ad and they have to get it from somewhere.

1904
02:18:32,697 --> 02:18:42,484
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically this was shown on Blu-ray forums with them all being marked down to $199.99 at Target beginning August 18th through August 24th.

1905
02:18:43,545 --> 02:18:45,065
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's been no confirmation.

1906
02:18:45,085 --> 02:18:51,047
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, this could have just been, you know, some sort of a photoshopping deal.

1907
02:18:51,067 --> 02:19:02,549
[SPEAKER_02]: But looking at the image, you can see bleed through from the other side for the ads on the other side, which is a lot more effort to put into photoshopping than most people will do.

1908
02:19:02,589 --> 02:19:08,630
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, considering where it's coming from, the Blu-ray forms, they're just looking at like Blu-ray, you know, discounts and stuff like that.

1909
02:19:08,650 --> 02:19:10,831
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think they're necessarily focusing on...

1910
02:19:12,131 --> 02:19:13,052
[SPEAKER_03]: Gaming consoles.

1911
02:19:13,212 --> 02:19:21,076
[SPEAKER_03]: I think if anything they're probably trying to clear out some inventory and move some of that product because they've been sitting on it for a while.

1912
02:19:22,597 --> 02:19:26,539
[SPEAKER_02]: The first thing that I do when I see stuff like this is make sure that it's not a Photoshop job.

1913
02:19:28,019 --> 02:19:37,184
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, there is a message from the article itself saying that Inside Gaming Daily reported speculation about doing a $500 Vita PS4 bundle.

1914
02:19:40,585 --> 02:19:42,027
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I don't think they'd do that.

1915
02:19:42,047 --> 02:19:43,209
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, speculation.

1916
02:19:43,389 --> 02:19:48,115
[SPEAKER_02]: But it would kind of go in if they did decrease the cost of the PS Vita.

1917
02:19:48,976 --> 02:19:51,439
[SPEAKER_02]: Then that would make it easier to bundle with the system.

1918
02:19:52,600 --> 02:19:52,780
[SPEAKER_03]: For $4.99?

1919
02:19:52,901 --> 02:19:54,382
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that what they were saying?

1920
02:19:55,324 --> 02:19:57,566
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they were saying, yeah, $500 bundle.

1921
02:20:00,200 --> 02:20:15,483
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, if you've got the system going up for $399 and then you threw in a $100 Vita and it competes with basically the X-Bone, you're actually getting a better deal with the PlayStation.

1922
02:20:15,623 --> 02:20:20,744
[SPEAKER_07]: It better come with a Lamborghini and a Virgin Galactic space flight and a trip to Dubai.

1923
02:20:22,345 --> 02:20:22,965
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe not.

1924
02:20:23,065 --> 02:20:28,126
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I would rather have a system with a handheld system than have to deal with the stupid Kinect bullshit.

1925
02:20:28,686 --> 02:20:29,106
[SPEAKER_02]: Just saying.

1926
02:20:30,770 --> 02:20:31,671
[SPEAKER_02]: It'd be nice if it was true.

1927
02:20:32,932 --> 02:20:35,053
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if I'd want a $100 space flight.

1928
02:20:35,073 --> 02:20:36,134
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds kind of dangerous.

1929
02:20:37,995 --> 02:20:40,557
[SPEAKER_03]: So Nintendo is fighting piracy.

1930
02:20:40,957 --> 02:20:43,639
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is actually more of like legit piracy.

1931
02:20:44,939 --> 02:20:47,121
[SPEAKER_03]: This is coming from a website.

1932
02:20:47,621 --> 02:20:48,602
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, wait, wait.

1933
02:20:48,902 --> 02:20:50,443
[SPEAKER_03]: What is legit piracy?

1934
02:20:50,543 --> 02:20:54,005
[SPEAKER_03]: Like making physical goods.

1935
02:20:54,125 --> 02:20:57,608
[SPEAKER_03]: Like duplicating physical goods and stuff.

1936
02:20:57,628 --> 02:20:58,128
[SPEAKER_03]: For example...

1937
02:20:58,368 --> 02:21:00,049
[SPEAKER_03]: with an eyepatch on them.

1938
02:21:00,149 --> 02:21:11,878
[SPEAKER_03]: They filed a lawsuit against a website called HackYourConsole.com and one of the things, you know, other than selling the R4 device and similar things, they also happen to sell hard drives that are preloaded with 200 Wii games.

1939
02:21:12,278 --> 02:21:13,319
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm, that sounds a...

1940
02:21:14,359 --> 02:21:16,860
[SPEAKER_03]: Bit bad, you know, that's pretty clear-cut there.

1941
02:21:17,380 --> 02:21:22,621
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yes, they've lost it against them, and most likely they're probably going to win.

1942
02:21:23,021 --> 02:21:24,662
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, I mean, that's pretty clear-cut.

1943
02:21:25,042 --> 02:21:31,343
[SPEAKER_03]: If they were just selling, like, you know, the R4 devices and stuff, I'd say that they may have, like, a little bit of a fight ahead of them.

1944
02:21:31,403 --> 02:21:42,306
[SPEAKER_03]: But selling actual, you know, hard drives that are full of, you know, games, that's kind of bad.

1945
02:21:44,693 --> 02:21:45,594
[SPEAKER_07]: Street Fighter V

1946
02:22:03,903 --> 02:22:04,444
[SPEAKER_07]: and DarkSakura.com.

1947
02:22:22,304 --> 02:22:41,873
[SPEAKER_07]: but here's the thing according to one of the producers at Capcom Tomoaki Ayano says that quote users do not need to worry because the characters will definitely not be just copy and pasted for Street Fighter X Tech and if we did that they would undoubtedly be the strongest characters in the game so these characters will be redone for Ultra Street Fighter 4 but what happens next?

1948
02:22:43,701 --> 02:22:49,766
[SPEAKER_07]: It took six years to go from Street Fighter 2 to Street Fighter 3 and nine years to go from Street Fighter 3 to Street Fighter 4.

1949
02:22:50,607 --> 02:22:56,012
[SPEAKER_07]: So it would probably take us until the year 2018 before Street Fighter 5 comes out.

1950
02:22:57,013 --> 02:22:59,075
[SPEAKER_07]: So yes, no Street Fighter 5 until 2018.

1951
02:22:59,415 --> 02:23:03,899
[SPEAKER_07]: But look forward to, insert adjective here, Street Fighter 4 each and every year until then.

1952
02:23:04,312 --> 02:23:05,573
[SPEAKER_03]: Single adjective, please.

1953
02:23:07,175 --> 02:23:09,958
[SPEAKER_06]: In 2018, I'll be turning 40 and that makes me sad.

1954
02:23:10,298 --> 02:23:12,480
[SPEAKER_06]: And you'll be 42.

1955
02:23:12,520 --> 02:23:14,963
[SPEAKER_07]: 40 also, not 42.

1956
02:23:16,845 --> 02:23:19,407
[SPEAKER_07]: But at least we'll have Street Fighter V at our birthday party to celebrate.

1957
02:23:19,427 --> 02:23:20,428
[SPEAKER_02]: We can both be quiet.

1958
02:23:22,310 --> 02:23:23,651
[SPEAKER_02]: I have three years for that shit.

1959
02:23:24,572 --> 02:23:24,873
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

1960
02:23:25,113 --> 02:23:27,135
[SPEAKER_07]: You forgot 40 and amazing.

1961
02:23:28,942 --> 02:23:29,002
[SPEAKER_07]: O.L.R.

1962
02:23:41,210 --> 02:23:46,233
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey kids, come listen to our super cool show about games.

1963
02:23:47,053 --> 02:23:50,555
[SPEAKER_02]: I tried to play this Kinect shit and broke my hip.

1964
02:23:50,715 --> 02:23:53,016
[SPEAKER_07]: All you guys listening, you're all getting older too.

1965
02:23:56,238 --> 02:23:58,039
[SPEAKER_02]: We do have listeners that are older than us.

1966
02:23:58,259 --> 02:23:59,119
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys will all be like 30.

1967
02:24:02,941 --> 02:24:06,064
[SPEAKER_07]: My 30s are awesome, for the record.

1968
02:24:06,384 --> 02:24:07,846
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, let's get to the mailbag.

1969
02:24:07,886 --> 02:24:10,108
[SPEAKER_07]: Speaking of our listeners, we love to hear from our listeners.

1970
02:24:10,128 --> 02:24:10,588
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we don't.

1971
02:24:10,728 --> 02:24:11,910
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, yeah, we do.

1972
02:24:12,010 --> 02:24:12,410
[SPEAKER_07]: Shut up.

1973
02:24:12,510 --> 02:24:13,091
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course we do.

1974
02:24:13,111 --> 02:24:14,432
[SPEAKER_07]: We love to hear from our listeners every week.

1975
02:24:15,573 --> 02:24:18,916
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can email us, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

1976
02:24:19,256 --> 02:24:24,141
[SPEAKER_07]: Dark Sakura will be peer pressured into reading her favorite emails here on the show.

1977
02:24:26,123 --> 02:24:26,663
[SPEAKER_07]: Read the emails.

1978
02:24:27,304 --> 02:24:28,205
[SPEAKER_02]: God dang, Rob.

1979
02:24:29,861 --> 02:24:31,201
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi all, Raginator here.

1980
02:24:31,581 --> 02:24:34,022
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's a last second short random question.

1981
02:24:34,442 --> 02:24:38,343
[SPEAKER_02]: What is the worst game each of you have played and what qualifies said games as being the worst?

1982
02:24:38,763 --> 02:24:43,544
[SPEAKER_02]: I can tell you one that was so bad that Dan and I took it back to Blockbuster and requested a refund.

1983
02:24:44,604 --> 02:24:46,365
[SPEAKER_02]: That was like some wrestling game.

1984
02:24:46,445 --> 02:24:48,405
[SPEAKER_02]: It was Thunder, like WCW Thunder.

1985
02:24:49,585 --> 02:24:53,286
[SPEAKER_02]: This was when we were on a really big wrestling kick and it was just bad.

1986
02:24:53,586 --> 02:24:54,907
[SPEAKER_02]: We were like, what the hell is this?

1987
02:24:55,267 --> 02:24:56,107
[SPEAKER_02]: And also Spice World.

1988
02:24:58,240 --> 02:25:01,847
[SPEAKER_07]: Fusion Frenzy 2 is the worst game in recent memory that I've played.

1989
02:25:01,887 --> 02:25:03,170
[SPEAKER_07]: It was so fucking bad.

1990
02:25:07,105 --> 02:25:07,505
[SPEAKER_07]: Yaris.

1991
02:25:08,946 --> 02:25:10,206
[SPEAKER_06]: That was going to be my answer.

1992
02:25:11,027 --> 02:25:11,607
[SPEAKER_06]: Me too, me too.

1993
02:25:12,327 --> 02:25:12,628
[SPEAKER_07]: Fair enough.

1994
02:25:12,748 --> 02:25:13,828
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, that's it?

1995
02:25:14,168 --> 02:25:15,529
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1996
02:25:16,089 --> 02:25:16,870
[SPEAKER_02]: God, this is long.

1997
02:25:18,110 --> 02:25:24,653
[SPEAKER_02]: With links to YouTube that I am not going to address because, first of all, can't watch YouTube on my iPad.

1998
02:25:24,753 --> 02:25:25,313
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1999
02:25:25,634 --> 02:25:26,674
[SPEAKER_07]: You can watch YouTube on your iPad.

2000
02:25:26,694 --> 02:25:28,175
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I can, but not during the show.

2001
02:25:28,895 --> 02:25:30,037
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, just to be clear.

2002
02:25:30,378 --> 02:25:31,079
[SPEAKER_02]: Stop it.

2003
02:25:31,861 --> 02:25:32,962
[SPEAKER_02]: This is from WellStillUT.

2004
02:25:33,904 --> 02:25:34,605
[SPEAKER_02]: Greetings, OLR.

2005
02:25:35,026 --> 02:25:36,869
[SPEAKER_02]: First off, I hope you guys enjoyed your week off.

2006
02:25:37,310 --> 02:25:38,873
[SPEAKER_02]: I might have if I still had a job.

2007
02:25:40,686 --> 02:25:41,907
[SPEAKER_02]: I know we can all use one.

2008
02:25:42,227 --> 02:25:46,031
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, I thought I'd share some thoughts about Phil Fish's recent childish outburst.

2009
02:25:46,411 --> 02:25:50,815
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, I'm greatly disappointed that you guys didn't properly present Marcus Beer's complaint.

2010
02:25:51,816 --> 02:25:59,382
[SPEAKER_02]: At least to me, he seemed more angry than Phil Fish and Jonathan Blow were acting as though being asked questions was some sort of unreasonable burden.

2011
02:25:59,702 --> 02:26:00,763
[SPEAKER_02]: In case you haven't, Link...

2012
02:26:02,927 --> 02:26:06,390
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd certainly love to see what Phil Fish and Jonathan Blow said to Game Informer leading up to this.

2013
02:26:06,830 --> 02:26:15,778
[SPEAKER_02]: However, with only Marcus' initial rant and Fish's immature response, it just looks like a lot of grief could have been saved with more boilerplate noncommittal response.

2014
02:26:16,899 --> 02:26:18,240
[SPEAKER_02]: Which leads me to my position.

2015
02:26:18,260 --> 02:26:23,745
[SPEAKER_02]: Phil Fish cancelled Fez 2 and is leaving the game industry just because a few people called out his condescending nonsense.

2016
02:26:24,221 --> 02:26:36,268
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously, I'm some insignificant twit in Miami who gets worse every time he sends an email to the show saying something someone doesn't like, but do you see me pitching my skirt and running away?

2017
02:26:37,289 --> 02:26:37,509
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

2018
02:26:38,049 --> 02:26:42,052
[SPEAKER_02]: Only reason I haven't sent an email lately is because I've not had anything to say before this.

2019
02:26:42,572 --> 02:26:45,434
[SPEAKER_02]: You ask me, Marcus is 100% right on this.

2020
02:26:45,994 --> 02:26:51,237
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't have anything to say, or you're looking for confirmation, you can say so.

2021
02:26:51,937 --> 02:26:52,158
[SPEAKER_02]: If you...

2022
02:26:53,358 --> 02:26:56,519
[SPEAKER_02]: You can give a rote we do not comment on rumors and speculation if you like.

2023
02:26:57,160 --> 02:27:05,703
[SPEAKER_02]: However, unless you're going to do a massive TV and radio advertisement carpet bombing, it's not a good idea to treat the press like they're the worst thing that's ever existed.

2024
02:27:06,563 --> 02:27:15,247
[SPEAKER_02]: If they're not asking anything personal or trying to create controversy for page hits, then treat them with the measure of respect that you want them to treat you, or more importantly, your game.

2025
02:27:16,327 --> 02:27:19,029
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, I hope the press takes Marcus Spears' advice.

2026
02:27:19,149 --> 02:27:31,277
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope Blow and Fish, especially Fish, have trouble for the rest of their careers finding press who want to endure their nonsensical whining because that's the only thing that hostile assholes deserve.

2027
02:27:31,737 --> 02:27:41,363
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, I know that Fish will come back, probably with Kickstarter for Fez 2, and get his goal times a billion because misgamers stop thinking for themselves when words like innovation and independent are thrown about.

2028
02:27:42,344 --> 02:27:46,685
[SPEAKER_02]: This is, of course, while many other developers in the year know struggle to gain any attention at all.

2029
02:27:47,105 --> 02:27:48,646
[SPEAKER_02]: There truly is no justice in the world.

2030
02:27:49,786 --> 02:27:54,928
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, I had a quick question unrelated to this nonsense.

2031
02:27:55,468 --> 02:28:05,771
[SPEAKER_02]: Recently, Giant Bomb had a quick look of Dynasty Warriors 8, in which the only bit of information that could be gleaned from the entire hour they looked at it was that the Xbox 360 version was a poorly done port.

2032
02:28:06,631 --> 02:28:09,613
[SPEAKER_02]: Why was there so little information for such a long video?

2033
02:28:09,693 --> 02:28:15,716
[SPEAKER_02]: Because Jeff and Vinny were devoted to hammering the hit X joke into the ground and whining about how they hated the series as a whole.

2034
02:28:16,537 --> 02:28:20,739
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, I've never played a Musou game before and was mainly scared off of them.

2035
02:28:20,839 --> 02:28:25,942
[SPEAKER_02]: As it seems, many of the media outlets I frequent have the same attitude of dismissing the games at first glance.

2036
02:28:25,962 --> 02:28:28,623
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you need to read Destructoid and Jim...

2037
02:28:29,784 --> 02:28:31,065
[SPEAKER_03]: Jim Sterling, a huge fan of that.

2038
02:28:31,125 --> 02:28:34,808
[SPEAKER_07]: See, some people... Sorry to interrupt, DarkSakura, but some people are here for that.

2039
02:28:34,908 --> 02:28:42,794
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think either you're kind of like a fan of those types of games where it's... Some people get great pleasure out of button-mashing X and kill, kill, kill, die, die, die.

2040
02:28:43,194 --> 02:28:45,796
[SPEAKER_03]: You just need to follow... See, that's the thing with reviewers.

2041
02:28:45,836 --> 02:28:49,098
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't just take some anonymous reviewer's opinion for it.

2042
02:28:49,118 --> 02:28:50,219
[SPEAKER_03]: You gotta look at what they like.

2043
02:28:51,140 --> 02:28:58,225
[SPEAKER_03]: And if they like similar games that you like, then that's the reviewer you follow as far as whether you may like something that... If they...

2044
02:28:59,526 --> 02:29:00,026
[SPEAKER_03]: That's stupid.

2045
02:29:00,046 --> 02:29:00,086
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

2046
02:29:23,138 --> 02:29:24,359
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2047
02:29:41,297 --> 02:29:58,619
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not saying focus necessarily on just one but you do have to kind of you have to find those that kind of mesh well with your taste and I think like Loki said I don't know much about these Jim Sterling reviews but it sounds like if he's more of a fan of these maybe this is at least a good counterbalance to what you saw happen over on there's more in the email okay sorry there's a lot more in the email all right

2048
02:29:59,199 --> 02:30:08,505
[SPEAKER_02]: However, I read a blog defending the series, and this was on Giant Bomb, and was immediately struck by the calm yet passionate defense of the series and the blogger's reactions for loving it as he does.

2049
02:30:09,005 --> 02:30:14,748
[SPEAKER_02]: Intrigued by the case he made, I picked up Warriors Orochi 3 Hyper for Wii U as a sort of test for how I'd feel.

2050
02:30:15,349 --> 02:30:25,515
[SPEAKER_02]: I ended up enjoying the game immensely and have since picked up Dynasty Warriors 8 for the PS3 and the original Warriors Orochi for 360, in addition to importing the PS3 version of Dynasty Warriors 7 Empires.

2051
02:30:26,375 --> 02:30:36,284
[SPEAKER_02]: I think about this now against the current backdrop of people passionately tearing apart reviewers for having a less than positive opinion of Dragon's Crown to the point where Atlas had to defend controversial reviews.

2052
02:30:37,605 --> 02:30:45,111
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, my problem with Dragon's Crown is just the... I love and hate the art style in that game, and that's really what I hate.

2053
02:30:45,451 --> 02:30:49,555
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you see the minigame where the girl's chained up and you can touch her and she squirms?

2054
02:30:49,850 --> 02:30:51,731
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I hate that.

2055
02:30:52,752 --> 02:30:54,053
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, going onward.

2056
02:30:54,794 --> 02:31:11,245
[SPEAKER_02]: While I don't like the game either after having played it, I can safely assume that were I on the fence, controversial ranting we're seeing now would not have driven me to try the way the game, the way the impassioned and mature defensive dynasty warriors I mentioned earlier had moved me.

2057
02:31:12,206 --> 02:31:13,887
[SPEAKER_02]: With that in mind, here's my inquiry.

2058
02:31:15,464 --> 02:31:16,605
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it was a short question.

2059
02:31:16,966 --> 02:31:18,187
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

2060
02:31:18,207 --> 02:31:19,388
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, RawStillUT.

2061
02:31:19,488 --> 02:31:24,613
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually really like your emails because of how well written they are and just how well you lay out your ideas.

2062
02:31:25,242 --> 02:31:25,642
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

2063
02:31:25,682 --> 02:31:29,944
[SPEAKER_07]: I do appreciate that he does come back when he's got something to say.

2064
02:31:30,164 --> 02:31:30,344
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

2065
02:31:31,285 --> 02:31:32,946
[SPEAKER_02]: With that in mind, here's my inquiry.

2066
02:31:33,346 --> 02:31:35,667
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh-oh, I need to make sure I don't get kicked out of chat.

2067
02:31:35,727 --> 02:31:35,967
[SPEAKER_02]: Oops.

2068
02:31:36,648 --> 02:31:36,888
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

2069
02:31:38,909 --> 02:31:47,273
[SPEAKER_02]: First, why does defending something often turn into attacks on disagreeing reviewers despite it being counterproductive to the apparent goal of winning over the indecisive?

2070
02:31:47,873 --> 02:31:49,794
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, to go on that first, I mean, look at freaking politics.

2071
02:31:50,606 --> 02:31:51,186
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh God, yes.

2072
02:31:51,887 --> 02:31:52,847
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's more human nature.

2073
02:31:52,867 --> 02:31:53,948
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not something specific to gaming.

2074
02:31:53,968 --> 02:31:54,388
[SPEAKER_02]: That's human nature.

2075
02:31:54,648 --> 02:31:55,589
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's human nature.

2076
02:31:55,629 --> 02:31:56,389
[SPEAKER_07]: My way or the highway.

2077
02:31:56,429 --> 02:32:01,692
[SPEAKER_02]: And as I mentioned in part A, people actually do get a positive chemical response from having other people agree with them.

2078
02:32:02,653 --> 02:32:14,900
[SPEAKER_02]: And by presenting their own information, I think it's a dopamine response where people actually feel better attacking something that's outside their scope of understanding.

2079
02:32:14,960 --> 02:32:16,801
[SPEAKER_07]: It feels good to be validated and affirmated?

2080
02:32:16,861 --> 02:32:17,381
[SPEAKER_07]: Get out.

2081
02:32:19,662 --> 02:32:20,343
[SPEAKER_07]: I understand.

2082
02:32:20,523 --> 02:32:25,906
[SPEAKER_02]: But for some people, they actually take that aggression side of it and get kind of an adrenaline rush off of it.

2083
02:32:26,707 --> 02:32:32,350
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you get into that, especially the more passionate you feel about something, you stop really caring about what other people think.

2084
02:32:32,850 --> 02:32:33,931
[SPEAKER_02]: Your idea or nothing.

2085
02:32:34,631 --> 02:32:36,913
[SPEAKER_02]: And you do get an emotional rush out of it.

2086
02:32:37,073 --> 02:32:40,695
[SPEAKER_02]: So it really is just basic biochemistry and psychology.

2087
02:32:42,015 --> 02:32:44,216
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody else want to expand?

2088
02:32:44,336 --> 02:32:46,376
[SPEAKER_07]: Nah, go ahead, because I know there's at least a couple more.

2089
02:32:46,516 --> 02:32:51,517
[SPEAKER_02]: Second, have you ever been moved by an unpopular game's defenders to give said game a chance?

2090
02:32:52,257 --> 02:32:52,877
[SPEAKER_02]: Mass Effect.

2091
02:32:55,397 --> 02:32:56,598
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Mass Effect is a good example.

2092
02:32:56,618 --> 02:32:59,638
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it wasn't unpopular, but a lot of people, I wasn't going to give it a chance.

2093
02:32:59,838 --> 02:33:03,839
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, at the time, remember, we got into it right when Mass Effect 3 had first come out.

2094
02:33:03,899 --> 02:33:04,219
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

2095
02:33:04,239 --> 02:33:07,599
[SPEAKER_07]: There was all that ending wank, so I don't know about the unpopular part.

2096
02:33:08,760 --> 02:33:09,980
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, God, even just this week,

2097
02:33:11,000 --> 02:33:12,301
[SPEAKER_07]: I gave Team Fortress 2 a try.

2098
02:33:12,341 --> 02:33:15,803
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't think I'd like it, but Actdeft was like, no, you gotta try, you gotta try.

2099
02:33:15,883 --> 02:33:18,105
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's a massively unpopular game.

2100
02:33:18,125 --> 02:33:18,685
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's true.

2101
02:33:18,725 --> 02:33:20,766
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess Team Fortress isn't really unpopular either.

2102
02:33:21,387 --> 02:33:24,249
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, God, what about the music games we used to play for years?

2103
02:33:24,529 --> 02:33:26,230
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think those cracked into the mainstream.

2104
02:33:26,823 --> 02:33:29,545
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and I actually liked Kraken DJ for a while.

2105
02:33:29,725 --> 02:33:30,566
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought that was fun.

2106
02:33:30,846 --> 02:33:32,067
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of people were like, eh.

2107
02:33:34,609 --> 02:33:41,694
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that there were others because, like, some of the weirder treasure games that people were kind of poo-pooing on I thought were great.

2108
02:33:41,754 --> 02:33:43,395
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like, I liked Chameleon Twist.

2109
02:33:44,256 --> 02:33:45,797
[SPEAKER_02]: I liked Mischief Makers.

2110
02:33:45,937 --> 02:33:46,938
[SPEAKER_02]: Those were fun games.

2111
02:33:47,599 --> 02:33:47,839
[SPEAKER_02]: You know?

2112
02:33:48,779 --> 02:33:49,160
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything?

2113
02:33:49,180 --> 02:33:51,261
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

2114
02:33:52,062 --> 02:33:53,343
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, keep up the good work, guys.

2115
02:33:53,583 --> 02:33:55,004
[SPEAKER_02]: I look forward to your response.

2116
02:33:55,104 --> 02:33:56,045
[SPEAKER_02]: Regards, RawsteelUT.

2117
02:33:56,065 --> 02:33:56,245
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

2118
02:33:57,096 --> 02:33:57,456
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

2119
02:33:58,176 --> 02:33:58,637
[SPEAKER_02]: Two more to go.

2120
02:33:58,657 --> 02:33:59,097
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

2121
02:33:59,637 --> 02:34:05,859
[SPEAKER_02]: Dearest denizens of Podcastopia, so I got a summons for jury duty for next week.

2122
02:34:05,899 --> 02:34:06,359
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

2123
02:34:07,340 --> 02:34:15,662
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know on what day this week I will have to drag my happy ass out of bed to be at the courthouse at 8am to do my civic duty, but I do know that day is not Monday.

2124
02:34:15,762 --> 02:34:19,944
[SPEAKER_02]: This gives me at least one day to download a game off PSN to play on my Vita.

2125
02:34:20,504 --> 02:34:21,204
[SPEAKER_02]: What should I get?

2126
02:34:21,724 --> 02:34:29,066
[SPEAKER_02]: Preferably, I'd like something that won't make a lot of noise but will require me to make a lot of movements that look vaguely threatening to old people.

2127
02:34:29,787 --> 02:34:31,527
[SPEAKER_02]: Stay black, Red Entertainment, Trainer.

2128
02:34:34,928 --> 02:34:36,849
[SPEAKER_07]: Gaming during jury duty is great.

2129
02:34:36,869 --> 02:34:38,489
[SPEAKER_07]: There is going to be long periods of waiting.

2130
02:34:39,755 --> 02:34:40,295
[SPEAKER_02]: and you know what?

2131
02:34:40,796 --> 02:34:43,037
[SPEAKER_02]: You know the Sacramento Courthouse that make you turn off all your devices.

2132
02:34:43,577 --> 02:34:43,838
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

2133
02:34:43,938 --> 02:34:45,599
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're in the selection.

2134
02:34:45,619 --> 02:34:47,420
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2135
02:34:47,460 --> 02:34:51,262
[SPEAKER_07]: But I mean like while you're waiting in the jury hall, while you're waiting in the hallway.

2136
02:34:51,402 --> 02:34:56,445
[SPEAKER_02]: I have always spent more time in the stupid jury selection than I have ever in the lines.

2137
02:34:57,946 --> 02:35:01,769
[SPEAKER_02]: So any suggestions for Vita games that make you look vaguely spasmodic?

2138
02:35:05,571 --> 02:35:07,452
[SPEAKER_07]: Not that don't involve Kinect.

2139
02:35:08,133 --> 02:35:08,553
[SPEAKER_06]: Katamari!

2140
02:35:08,573 --> 02:35:08,733
[SPEAKER_06]: Katamari!

2141
02:35:10,968 --> 02:35:26,965
[SPEAKER_06]: LittleBigPlanet maybe I can't recommend this because the game is bad but a fighting game involves Capcom X Tekken so that'll be mashing the buttons and looking mean

2142
02:35:29,936 --> 02:35:32,798
[SPEAKER_02]: I definitely see looks of frustration in playing that, so that makes sense.

2143
02:35:33,679 --> 02:35:34,940
[SPEAKER_02]: So we do have one last email.

2144
02:35:36,060 --> 02:35:37,862
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, OLR crew, AZHP here.

2145
02:35:38,602 --> 02:35:41,665
[SPEAKER_02]: I never asked, is it AzHP or AZHP?

2146
02:35:41,805 --> 02:35:44,567
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's AZHP, because I thought the HP was Harry Potter.

2147
02:35:44,858 --> 02:35:47,719
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2148
02:36:04,264 --> 02:36:05,625
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2149
02:36:24,256 --> 02:36:26,738
[SPEAKER_02]: The vibe we got from the convention was super positive.

2150
02:36:27,299 --> 02:36:28,340
[SPEAKER_02]: The game room was lots of fun.

2151
02:36:28,400 --> 02:36:34,184
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to play the Japanese version of Project Diva F, the Saturn version of Puzzle Bobble, and typing of the Dead on Dreamcast.

2152
02:36:35,165 --> 02:36:41,611
[SPEAKER_02]: I was actually surprised there weren't that many furries at the convention, given that I know a lot of gamers are also furries.

2153
02:36:41,651 --> 02:36:46,194
[SPEAKER_07]: There were a couple, because they were even advertising a furry con that's coming up, had one of the booths.

2154
02:36:46,675 --> 02:36:50,458
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, hey, whatever you like, as long as it's, you know, consensual.

2155
02:36:51,423 --> 02:36:54,686
[SPEAKER_02]: I unfortunately wasn't able to stay late enough to catch the podcast panel.

2156
02:36:54,726 --> 02:36:58,589
[SPEAKER_02]: I definitely regret missing my chance to say hi to Rob.

2157
02:36:59,209 --> 02:36:59,770
[SPEAKER_02]: Squinty face.

2158
02:36:59,910 --> 02:37:00,610
[SPEAKER_07]: As you should.

2159
02:37:01,371 --> 02:37:03,412
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, I definitely recommend people check it out.

2160
02:37:03,532 --> 02:37:05,014
[SPEAKER_02]: It's definitely a fun experience.

2161
02:37:05,074 --> 02:37:05,714
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, definitely.

2162
02:37:05,854 --> 02:37:06,655
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of definitely's there.

2163
02:37:07,175 --> 02:37:09,977
[SPEAKER_02]: Check it out again next year if it's in San Francisco again.

2164
02:37:10,058 --> 02:37:11,218
[SPEAKER_02]: Yours truly is HP.

2165
02:37:11,939 --> 02:37:12,439
[SPEAKER_02]: P.S.

2166
02:37:12,559 --> 02:37:15,702
[SPEAKER_02]: If you guys are interested, here's a picture of the Zelda costume my girlfriend wore.

2167
02:37:16,050 --> 02:37:40,715
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually looked at the picture and I saw her which must have mean I saw you at some point and I was like wow that is fucking good so feel free to link in the chat I helped make the harp so it was cool hearing people compliment it at the convention so I'm pulling it up very nice yeah it was very good yeah if you can put that in chat I'm sure the chatters like to see that very well done

2168
02:37:41,613 --> 02:37:46,035
[SPEAKER_06]: I think, yeah, I saw her in the gaming room playing one of the dancing games.

2169
02:37:46,055 --> 02:37:46,575
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah.

2170
02:37:46,595 --> 02:37:50,417
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, well, I'm going to copy this if I didn't actually close the window.

2171
02:37:51,898 --> 02:37:53,738
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, that's it for emails tonight, right?

2172
02:37:54,319 --> 02:37:57,440
[SPEAKER_07]: Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

2173
02:37:57,460 --> 02:38:01,942
[SPEAKER_07]: We're almost to 9 o'clock, so let's try to jam through the rest of this pretty quick because I do want to get in some calls.

2174
02:38:02,982 --> 02:38:06,364
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're going to go to the FUs of the week.

2175
02:38:22,318 --> 02:38:22,918
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura.

2176
02:38:24,078 --> 02:38:27,619
[SPEAKER_02]: I was debating whether or not I wanted to say their name on air, but I'm going to.

2177
02:38:28,339 --> 02:38:40,122
[SPEAKER_02]: So, F you to Bonnie Plumbing, Heating, and Air for giving indications of being the type of hypocritical conservative Christians that I personally do not like.

2178
02:38:41,802 --> 02:38:42,242
[SPEAKER_02]: Allegedly.

2179
02:38:43,162 --> 02:38:43,822
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're Loki.

2180
02:38:44,623 --> 02:38:45,243
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and my battery.

2181
02:38:47,130 --> 02:38:53,495
[SPEAKER_03]: F you to my car for I'm not really sure what it's doing but whenever I turn all the way to the right my radio shuts off.

2182
02:38:55,036 --> 02:38:56,017
[SPEAKER_03]: That's weird.

2183
02:38:56,097 --> 02:38:56,417
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

2184
02:38:56,477 --> 02:38:57,458
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a little creepy.

2185
02:38:58,339 --> 02:39:05,904
[SPEAKER_07]: F you to this fucking con plague I've been carrying since Tuesday and F you to Extifer who allegedly gave it to me.

2186
02:39:06,305 --> 02:39:06,725
[SPEAKER_07]: Allegedly.

2187
02:39:07,546 --> 02:39:07,786
[SPEAKER_07]: Alan.

2188
02:39:08,326 --> 02:39:15,372
[SPEAKER_06]: F you to the associated dental issues that someone can get when they're in their 30s and also F you to the fact that I think Sanrio

2189
02:39:16,152 --> 02:39:18,973
[SPEAKER_06]: I wonder why she would have chewed that

2190
02:39:34,118 --> 02:39:34,518
[SPEAKER_07]: It's weird.

2191
02:39:34,538 --> 02:39:36,941
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to have to buy a new headset.

2192
02:39:37,282 --> 02:39:38,523
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like $40 that I don't have.

2193
02:39:39,845 --> 02:39:40,405
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, there it is.

2194
02:39:40,425 --> 02:39:41,166
[SPEAKER_03]: You have Fuse of the Week.

2195
02:39:41,767 --> 02:39:42,027
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki.

2196
02:39:43,069 --> 02:39:44,230
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

2197
02:39:44,410 --> 02:39:45,812
[SPEAKER_03]: So more Xbox One news.

2198
02:39:45,832 --> 02:39:50,158
[SPEAKER_03]: This is once again something else that they've kind of changed their mind on.

2199
02:39:50,678 --> 02:39:56,244
[SPEAKER_03]: and that was the whole inclusion of a chat headset with the Xbox One.

2200
02:39:56,444 --> 02:40:00,648
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, the Xbox One Day One Edition will come with a chat headset.

2201
02:40:01,349 --> 02:40:04,331
[SPEAKER_03]: So, it'll be very much like it was with the Xbox 360.

2202
02:40:04,391 --> 02:40:08,015
[SPEAKER_03]: Originally, they were planning not to include one of those and you'd have to buy it separately.

2203
02:40:08,616 --> 02:40:11,498
[SPEAKER_03]: So, good to know you're getting some more value for your $500.

2204
02:40:15,526 --> 02:40:16,086
[SPEAKER_07]: Hooray!

2205
02:40:16,226 --> 02:40:18,148
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess a lot of people are very excited about that.

2206
02:40:18,668 --> 02:40:19,769
[SPEAKER_07]: More value is good.

2207
02:40:20,810 --> 02:40:32,537
[SPEAKER_07]: And also, hooray, I want to end on a positive note tonight because unfortunately a lot of times we have to talk about gaming studios that are closing and people that are out of a job, but tonight we get to say hooray!

2208
02:40:33,018 --> 02:40:43,785
[SPEAKER_07]: In Vancouver, Namco Bandai is opening a new office and it's going to be dedicated to mobile and online titles, but about 30 people working there in Vancouver are

2209
02:40:44,225 --> 02:40:45,165
[SPEAKER_07]: making these titles.

2210
02:40:45,285 --> 02:40:48,586
[SPEAKER_07]: No word, of course, on what those games are, but yay.

2211
02:40:49,306 --> 02:40:52,186
[SPEAKER_06]: And since this is a Namco story, can I say something real quick?

2212
02:40:52,386 --> 02:40:52,727
[SPEAKER_06]: Please do.

2213
02:40:53,027 --> 02:40:54,627
[SPEAKER_06]: They're talking about this in chat.

2214
02:40:56,207 --> 02:41:01,268
[SPEAKER_06]: Pac-Man Champion Edition DX is coming to Steam with its DX Plus version.

2215
02:41:01,848 --> 02:41:06,129
[SPEAKER_06]: Out of respect for DarkSakura, I will say I purchased early, purchased in advance.

2216
02:41:06,769 --> 02:41:08,549
[SPEAKER_06]: I did not pre-purchase because that's not a thing.

2217
02:41:09,309 --> 02:41:10,650
[SPEAKER_06]: I purchased early the game.

2218
02:41:10,810 --> 02:41:11,870
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, stop feeding her.

2219
02:41:11,890 --> 02:41:12,490
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

2220
02:41:13,010 --> 02:41:14,511
[SPEAKER_02]: Alan is perfectly right.

2221
02:41:14,871 --> 02:41:19,592
[SPEAKER_06]: If you purchase early, because it's not going to be playable until September 24th, and they took my $9.99.

2222
02:41:19,672 --> 02:41:25,274
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you purchase early, you'll get what I think is going to be a DLC pack.

2223
02:41:25,314 --> 02:41:28,995
[SPEAKER_06]: It's extra songs, extra maps, and you can play as the little Dig Dug avatar.

2224
02:41:29,275 --> 02:41:31,316
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought some of that was supposed to be part of it anyway.

2225
02:41:31,436 --> 02:41:32,776
[SPEAKER_06]: And a little race car avatar.

2226
02:41:32,816 --> 02:41:38,358
[SPEAKER_06]: Well it says Actdeft in chat pasted the Steam link and it'll say purchase now and you'll get all this crap.

2227
02:41:39,018 --> 02:41:42,879
[SPEAKER_06]: So new Pac-Man or Pac-Man DX is such an amazing game.

2228
02:41:43,479 --> 02:41:44,740
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah it is a great Pac-Man game.

2229
02:41:44,780 --> 02:41:45,340
[SPEAKER_06]: It's coming to Steam.

2230
02:41:45,760 --> 02:41:46,020
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2231
02:41:46,381 --> 02:41:47,802
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to open up the phones now.

2232
02:41:48,203 --> 02:41:48,824
[SPEAKER_07]: It's that time.

2233
02:41:48,844 --> 02:41:56,232
[SPEAKER_07]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, if you want to give us a call and talk with us about anything we've talked about tonight.

2234
02:41:56,733 --> 02:41:59,496
[SPEAKER_07]: Or maybe you have something that we didn't cover that you want to talk about.

2235
02:42:00,076 --> 02:42:00,236
[SPEAKER_07]: But...

2236
02:42:02,096 --> 02:42:02,496
[SPEAKER_07]: There it is.

2237
02:42:02,556 --> 02:42:03,637
[SPEAKER_07]: The phones are open.

2238
02:42:03,657 --> 02:42:05,918
[SPEAKER_07]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype.

2239
02:42:06,058 --> 02:42:07,119
[SPEAKER_07]: Orange Lounge Radio.

2240
02:42:07,179 --> 02:42:10,541
[SPEAKER_07]: I saw at least one tweet come through that I want to get to here quickly.

2241
02:42:11,481 --> 02:42:13,042
[SPEAKER_07]: Otherwise, do we have any last-minute stories?

2242
02:42:13,283 --> 02:42:14,283
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, DarkSakura?

2243
02:42:14,964 --> 02:42:18,986
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I can talk real quick about... They announced... Well, I knew about them, but...

2244
02:42:19,266 --> 02:42:19,566
[SPEAKER_03]: Wreck-It-Ralph

2245
02:42:41,371 --> 02:43:04,281
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to have the Phineas and Ferb, or Phineas and Agent P And then of course, like I said, Wreck-It Ralph, Vanellope And then kind of some one-offs, they have Rapunzel from Tangled, Jack Skellington, and Mickey from Fantasia We actually have a call on the line, you can probably hear the coffee in the background We have a call on the line, hi, you're on Orange Sons Radio, who's this?

2246
02:43:05,219 --> 02:43:06,520
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, it's Codeman.

2247
02:43:06,560 --> 02:43:07,620
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey Codeman, how you doing?

2248
02:43:08,380 --> 02:43:11,101
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry for the Facebook sounds, Rob.

2249
02:43:11,461 --> 02:43:12,202
[SPEAKER_07]: You better be.

2250
02:43:12,862 --> 02:43:13,922
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess I can forgive.

2251
02:43:14,543 --> 02:43:15,463
[SPEAKER_07]: Was that you coughing?

2252
02:43:16,563 --> 02:43:17,244
[SPEAKER_04]: Do what?

2253
02:43:17,264 --> 02:43:18,144
[SPEAKER_07]: Was that you coughing?

2254
02:43:18,424 --> 02:43:19,224
[SPEAKER_07]: Or was that the little one?

2255
02:43:20,305 --> 02:43:21,105
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh no, she's asleep.

2256
02:43:21,245 --> 02:43:21,665
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, okay.

2257
02:43:21,705 --> 02:43:22,166
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, what's up?

2258
02:43:23,126 --> 02:43:27,908
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh no, I was just wanting to know if everyone's excited about August 13th.

2259
02:43:28,048 --> 02:43:30,489
[SPEAKER_04]: I am totally jazzed about Tuesday.

2260
02:43:31,613 --> 02:43:34,955
[SPEAKER_07]: and why why is this Disney Infinity or what is it that you're excited about?

2261
02:43:34,975 --> 02:43:35,515
[SPEAKER_07]: DuckTales isn't it?

2262
02:43:35,876 --> 02:43:36,616
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh DuckTales.

2263
02:43:36,636 --> 02:43:37,677
[SPEAKER_04]: DuckTales Remastered.

2264
02:43:37,697 --> 02:43:42,600
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yes yes I am excited about that yes so excited I forgot the day.

2265
02:43:44,080 --> 02:43:56,648
[SPEAKER_04]: Well and like what I was just so fan I mean I was just amazed about like they brought back every single voice actor yes that has ever played in the DuckTales series and and

2266
02:43:57,448 --> 02:43:58,529
[SPEAKER_04]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

2267
02:44:19,554 --> 02:44:20,676
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2268
02:44:34,714 --> 02:44:37,716
[SPEAKER_04]: But, I mean, I'm excited, so excited about the game.

2269
02:44:37,977 --> 02:44:39,418
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you guys feel about the game?

2270
02:44:39,518 --> 02:44:41,899
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously, you're probably pretty excited about it.

2271
02:44:42,000 --> 02:44:46,383
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I will definitely be picking it up, but even I can't decide what platform do I get it on.

2272
02:44:46,443 --> 02:44:51,046
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I could do PC, I could do Wii U, because, you know, it's kind of the newest thing out there.

2273
02:44:51,106 --> 02:44:54,569
[SPEAKER_07]: I could get PlayStation 3, because, you know, trophies or whatever.

2274
02:44:54,849 --> 02:44:56,830
[SPEAKER_07]: Xbox 360s, where a lot of my friends will probably be.

2275
02:44:57,271 --> 02:44:57,611
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

2276
02:44:57,771 --> 02:44:58,872
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what system to get it on.

2277
02:44:59,312 --> 02:44:59,993
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you decided?

2278
02:45:00,013 --> 02:45:00,053
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

2279
02:45:00,977 --> 02:45:09,339
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, unfortunately, I don't think they're releasing it for the Mac, so I can't get it on Steam, but I can, I think I'm going to be picking it up on the Wii U. And why is that?

2280
02:45:10,519 --> 02:45:19,641
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, because, I don't know, it's just nostalgic of, like, it being on Nintendo, like, when I used to play it when I was a kid, and so, like, I feel like I should play it on a Nintendo console.

2281
02:45:19,661 --> 02:45:24,382
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounds stupid, but, I don't know, I just feel like I should play it on a Nintendo console.

2282
02:45:24,798 --> 02:45:25,599
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, fair enough.

2283
02:45:25,739 --> 02:45:33,865
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I might end up getting it on Wii U, because at least it does have the off-screen play, which, you know, as little as it is, it is something the other platforms don't get.

2284
02:45:34,406 --> 02:45:37,328
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think Xbox 360 is delayed anyway, so that's out.

2285
02:45:37,648 --> 02:45:37,929
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.

2286
02:45:37,989 --> 02:45:44,574
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think it's September... I could be wrong, but I think it's September 13th or 14th, but I could be wrong.

2287
02:45:44,694 --> 02:45:49,338
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not a part of their ongoing promotion, so they kind of screwed up on that one, in my opinion.

2288
02:45:50,374 --> 02:46:00,882
[SPEAKER_04]: I am, that's what I enjoy about the whole Earthbound thing is, you know, because my wife, you know, she might want to watch Hulu or Netflix or something and I could just sit here on my Wii U tablet and play Earthbound all night.

2289
02:46:00,902 --> 02:46:02,163
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was really cool.

2290
02:46:02,183 --> 02:46:05,346
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Nintendo wants you to sell some Wii U's.

2291
02:46:05,386 --> 02:46:06,667
[SPEAKER_07]: That's exactly what they want to hear.

2292
02:46:07,948 --> 02:46:10,049
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I love that about that console.

2293
02:46:10,069 --> 02:46:14,012
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, you know, I picked up, you know, Metroid, you know, and all that stuff.

2294
02:46:14,052 --> 02:46:17,575
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, like, I can just sit there on my, you know, tablet and play that.

2295
02:46:17,635 --> 02:46:18,716
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's really cool.

2296
02:46:19,705 --> 02:46:20,125
[SPEAKER_07]: Excellent.

2297
02:46:20,486 --> 02:46:22,867
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, anything else you're looking forward to over these coming weeks?

2298
02:46:24,429 --> 02:46:26,910
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, well, I mean, not really.

2299
02:46:26,950 --> 02:46:31,794
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I'm going to be playing the hell out of DuckTales, so that's probably the only thing I'm going to be playing for a while.

2300
02:46:31,814 --> 02:46:35,496
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been playing Don't Starve for, it has stolen my life.

2301
02:46:35,697 --> 02:46:39,199
[SPEAKER_04]: It literally has, I mean, that game, I don't know if you've played it yet.

2302
02:46:39,539 --> 02:46:45,604
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't, not yet, but tell the listeners more about it for those that don't know, because you have been trying to get me in on this game.

2303
02:46:46,516 --> 02:46:48,597
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Don't Starve is basically a roguelike game.

2304
02:46:48,637 --> 02:46:49,937
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you start out at day one.

2305
02:46:51,137 --> 02:46:53,098
[SPEAKER_04]: It is the title.

2306
02:46:53,138 --> 02:47:00,220
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you're basically trying to survive, and you just continue on and on and on, and you go through all the seasons.

2307
02:47:00,300 --> 02:47:01,921
[SPEAKER_04]: You start out in spring.

2308
02:47:02,081 --> 02:47:10,524
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, actually, I think you start in the summer, and then you go into the spring, and then you go into the winter, and then everything has everything to do with, like, you have to build...

2309
02:47:11,864 --> 02:47:13,525
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

2310
02:47:32,739 --> 02:47:44,364
[SPEAKER_04]: Day 34 or something in the winter and I just ran out of food because nothing grows in the winter and then I died at Day 34 and it just starts you back at Day 1 with nothing.

2311
02:47:44,764 --> 02:47:56,490
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't played a roguelike game in forever so it's very frustrating but it's a very fun game and I would suggest anybody on Steam to buy it and play the hell out of it.

2312
02:47:56,890 --> 02:47:58,210
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's $14.99 and that's everything.

2313
02:47:58,230 --> 02:47:58,911
[SPEAKER_04]: They update it

2314
02:48:02,112 --> 02:48:03,433
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for calling in.

2315
02:48:03,553 --> 02:48:07,296
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have anything you need to plug?

2316
02:48:07,336 --> 02:48:08,517
[SPEAKER_04]: Want to plug before we get out?

2317
02:48:29,173 --> 02:48:29,814
[SPEAKER_04]: No, not really.

2318
02:48:29,854 --> 02:48:32,315
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we still have our podcast.

2319
02:48:32,335 --> 02:48:33,896
[SPEAKER_04]: We still do it from time to time.

2320
02:48:34,237 --> 02:48:35,397
[SPEAKER_04]: We've mostly moved to YouTube.

2321
02:48:35,437 --> 02:48:42,722
[SPEAKER_04]: We do Google Hangouts, but it's the YouTube.com backslash the Down for Maintenance podcast.

2322
02:48:42,742 --> 02:48:46,765
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think it's like the DFM podcast, but you can look us up on YouTube.

2323
02:48:46,805 --> 02:48:49,187
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I have a YouTube channel, but I mean...

2324
02:48:49,827 --> 02:48:50,928
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really hard to remember.

2325
02:48:51,168 --> 02:48:56,792
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's youtube.com backslash ctaylor1785 because YouTube won't let me change it.

2326
02:48:57,273 --> 02:48:58,694
[SPEAKER_06]: Dope.

2327
02:48:59,474 --> 02:49:03,657
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, you should do more Let's Plays, Rob.

2328
02:49:03,778 --> 02:49:10,723
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I was gifted by a kind listener another scary game called Paranormal, and that is up on the list of things I need to play, too.

2329
02:49:11,523 --> 02:49:14,125
[SPEAKER_04]: Holy crap, that game is fantastic.

2330
02:49:14,365 --> 02:49:15,887
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate it and love it all at the same time.

2331
02:49:15,907 --> 02:49:17,608
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure if I'm looking forward to it.

2332
02:49:17,688 --> 02:49:18,989
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, Codeman, I'm going to let you go, buddy.

2333
02:49:19,921 --> 02:49:21,102
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, well, I'll talk to you guys later.

2334
02:49:21,162 --> 02:49:21,682
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, take care.

2335
02:49:22,402 --> 02:49:22,802
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, bye.

2336
02:49:22,842 --> 02:49:23,023
[SPEAKER_07]: Bye.

2337
02:49:23,643 --> 02:49:25,524
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, and our phones are lighting up.

2338
02:49:25,564 --> 02:49:28,285
[SPEAKER_07]: We got another call coming in right now, so let's go to the phones.

2339
02:49:28,325 --> 02:49:29,306
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2340
02:49:29,326 --> 02:49:29,666
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's this?

2341
02:49:30,146 --> 02:49:30,746
[SPEAKER_05]: This is Shane.

2342
02:49:30,966 --> 02:49:32,027
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, Shane, how you doing?

2343
02:49:33,128 --> 02:49:33,908
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm hot.

2344
02:49:33,968 --> 02:49:35,649
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like really hot here right now.

2345
02:49:35,849 --> 02:49:37,630
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't it like... You should come to California.

2346
02:49:38,250 --> 02:49:39,291
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't it hotter there?

2347
02:49:39,311 --> 02:49:39,931
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, probably.

2348
02:49:39,951 --> 02:49:41,111
[SPEAKER_02]: But not at night, so come here.

2349
02:49:43,191 --> 02:49:43,912
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, maybe.

2350
02:49:44,032 --> 02:49:46,076
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not Phoenix or anything, and it's a dry read.

2351
02:49:46,676 --> 02:49:47,518
[SPEAKER_07]: Phoenix is terrible.

2352
02:49:47,638 --> 02:49:48,119
[SPEAKER_07]: It is terrible.

2353
02:49:48,159 --> 02:49:48,479
[SPEAKER_07]: What's up?

2354
02:49:49,681 --> 02:49:50,783
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, Pokemon.

2355
02:49:51,965 --> 02:49:54,388
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, did you hear my little dedication to you earlier?

2356
02:49:55,089 --> 02:49:57,994
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I take some issues with that dedication.

2357
02:49:59,055 --> 02:49:59,435
[SPEAKER_05]: Why?

2358
02:49:59,975 --> 02:50:01,936
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, first of all, you ended it too quick.

2359
02:50:02,176 --> 02:50:04,796
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, there's never enough time to talk about Pokemon.

2360
02:50:06,236 --> 02:50:17,339
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, okay, for example, my job today, I had a demo, and I was demoing the new Mario and Luigi game, and all the people that showed up pretty much just wanted to talk Pokemon with me, which I was fine with.

2361
02:50:17,399 --> 02:50:18,019
[SPEAKER_05]: That was fun.

2362
02:50:18,919 --> 02:50:20,279
[SPEAKER_05]: Way more fun than demoing a game.

2363
02:50:20,939 --> 02:50:23,500
[SPEAKER_05]: But, yeah, like...

2364
02:50:24,620 --> 02:50:32,866
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't like the thought that it should have stopped after 151 Pokemon.

2365
02:50:33,006 --> 02:50:33,687
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, Jamie.

2366
02:50:35,188 --> 02:50:38,950
[SPEAKER_05]: Just because that would have been boring.

2367
02:50:39,050 --> 02:50:46,396
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to keep the series going, and if you only had the same 151, we're like 15 years now or something like that since they first came out.

2368
02:50:47,196 --> 02:50:48,498
[SPEAKER_05]: That would have been terrible.

2369
02:50:48,798 --> 02:50:52,503
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, we're at 649 plus whatever new ones are in here.

2370
02:50:52,543 --> 02:50:53,744
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's still really fun.

2371
02:50:53,784 --> 02:50:58,089
[SPEAKER_05]: And these mega evolutions, like the new trailer that was posted is awesome.

2372
02:50:58,189 --> 02:50:59,691
[SPEAKER_05]: And it reminds me of Power Rangers.

2373
02:51:00,192 --> 02:51:01,413
[SPEAKER_05]: So I am on board.

2374
02:51:01,533 --> 02:51:02,094
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait a minute.

2375
02:51:02,114 --> 02:51:02,314
[SPEAKER_05]: 100% on board.

2376
02:51:02,975 --> 02:51:05,439
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait a minute, because the other night you said, I don't know.

2377
02:51:06,000 --> 02:51:09,204
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, but then they put a trailer that made it look like Power Rangers to me.

2378
02:51:09,525 --> 02:51:10,786
[SPEAKER_05]: And that is all you need to do.

2379
02:51:12,028 --> 02:51:17,576
[SPEAKER_05]: If there's more blue in the trailer and maybe some Taco Bell, which I'm still kind of boycotting.

2380
02:51:18,437 --> 02:51:44,886
[SPEAKER_07]: um wait you're boycotting Taco Bell yes they got rid of some stuff I liked oh that's right they got rid of the volcano stuff I forgot yeah and I really like that conversation the other night uh Fifth Dream in our chat room with a question for Shane hey they don't ask us questions anymore they ask the callers questions Fifth Dream wants to know Shane did you watch any of the Pokemon championships yes and I didn't want to I was just really bored I was like okay this will be fun and that's my sarcastic voice so I put it on it was so fun

2381
02:51:45,866 --> 02:51:47,267
[SPEAKER_05]: It was really fun to watch.

2382
02:51:47,567 --> 02:51:54,392
[SPEAKER_05]: And I watched some of the finals today before work, and I was getting excited, and there was no reason to.

2383
02:51:54,853 --> 02:51:59,356
[SPEAKER_05]: And I feel like it was when I liked basketball, when the NCAA tournament was going on.

2384
02:51:59,676 --> 02:52:02,078
[SPEAKER_05]: I just got sucked in, and it was amazing.

2385
02:52:03,706 --> 02:52:23,333
[SPEAKER_05]: and what what what was it the Pokemon card game or was it the um they had the card game later today which I was at work for so I couldn't watch that it was the actual like video games wow and Nintendo let him stream it well because it's Nintendo sponsored me and my friend Danny we want to go to next year's championships it's in DC this year was in Vancouver

2386
02:52:24,053 --> 02:52:50,718
[SPEAKER_05]: but like they get all sorts of cool stuff they have all this merchandise and like things that you won't find anywhere else just at the world championships and like today or yesterday they announced a new mega evolution and that they haven't put out anywhere else and they announced that they're gonna have a soundtrack out on iTunes this November for X and Y that's gonna have 220 tracks good lord yeah that's ridiculous

2387
02:52:51,536 --> 02:52:51,937
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my gosh.

2388
02:52:51,957 --> 02:52:53,158
[SPEAKER_05]: And I will have it day one.

2389
02:52:53,258 --> 02:52:56,963
[SPEAKER_07]: So what's the countdown to X and Y at this point?

2390
02:52:57,003 --> 02:52:57,724
[SPEAKER_07]: How many days left?

2391
02:52:58,886 --> 02:53:01,148
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like almost exactly two months.

2392
02:53:01,309 --> 02:53:02,350
[SPEAKER_05]: Tomorrow will be two months.

2393
02:53:02,390 --> 02:53:04,232
[SPEAKER_05]: But for me, I don't know because I'll get it early.

2394
02:53:04,313 --> 02:53:06,716
[SPEAKER_05]: So sucks to be everybody else.

2395
02:53:06,816 --> 02:53:07,156
[SPEAKER_05]: Rub it in.

2396
02:53:07,477 --> 02:53:09,820
[SPEAKER_07]: But at least you have Final Fantasy XIV to hold you over, right?

2397
02:53:10,307 --> 02:53:10,948
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, yes.

2398
02:53:11,048 --> 02:53:29,122
[SPEAKER_05]: And I learned today 100% because they put some sort of graph out that if I get the PS3 collector's edition, which I'm getting through Amazon because I had gift cards, so it's fully paid off and I apply it to my current PC account, I will be able to play on both for the free 30 days.

2399
02:53:29,283 --> 02:53:33,886
[SPEAKER_05]: And because I'm an old player, my 30 days won't kick in until September 10th.

2400
02:53:33,946 --> 02:53:34,427
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'll have

2401
02:53:34,767 --> 02:53:42,674
[SPEAKER_05]: from the 24th of August till September 10th, not paying anything, and then September 11th for the next 30 days for free as well.

2402
02:53:44,176 --> 02:53:44,596
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

2403
02:53:44,716 --> 02:53:46,858
[SPEAKER_05]: And you get all that Collector's Edition crap that you don't need.

2404
02:53:48,460 --> 02:53:48,840
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't need?

2405
02:53:51,141 --> 02:53:53,722
[SPEAKER_07]: that's rude what's in there that you need?

2406
02:53:54,162 --> 02:54:12,128
[SPEAKER_05]: the book, the art book is going to be fantastic the baby soundtrack because the other soundtrack is just way too expensive and I don't have anything that can play it except for a PS3 even though I want the little pet and the box that's acceptable to say, right?

2407
02:54:12,528 --> 02:54:19,611
[SPEAKER_05]: because the box looks cool alright, fair enough exactly alright Shane, anything else before we let you go?

2408
02:54:21,325 --> 02:54:44,698
[SPEAKER_05]: everybody should watch that new trailer it has like rock music that plays during it and it's like remixed I think of a gym theme and seriously if it doesn't remind you of Power Rangers which is what I'm seeing from everybody's comments everywhere on the internet that I'm looking right now you're crazy because the end with the five of them lined up and their mega evolutions it's totally Power Rangers it's awesome alright anything you want to plug while you're here on the show

2409
02:54:46,131 --> 02:55:14,103
[SPEAKER_05]: um well I just played Pokemon X and Y and we talked about Final Fantasy 14 um yes sure apparently there's a really cool Konami game in Japan called Sound Voltex and I've watched videos and it's awesome somebody I guess cracked it so you can play on your PC and there are websites now building controllers for the Sound Voltex game that you can buy that you'd be able to hook up to your PC and play it and that game is so cool looking you need to link me this

2410
02:55:14,833 --> 02:55:17,935
[SPEAKER_05]: I need to get a link to sound Voltex or for the controller?

2411
02:55:17,975 --> 02:55:22,619
[SPEAKER_05]: The controller is like 300 and some dollars for some reason.

2412
02:55:22,639 --> 02:55:24,000
[SPEAKER_05]: I can link you the gameplay.

2413
02:55:24,060 --> 02:55:24,360
[SPEAKER_02]: It's amazing.

2414
02:55:24,380 --> 02:55:24,860
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll talk on Facebook.

2415
02:55:24,880 --> 02:55:25,341
[SPEAKER_02]: How about that?

2416
02:55:25,361 --> 02:55:25,661
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2417
02:55:25,721 --> 02:55:27,042
[SPEAKER_05]: Get on the case, Nancy Drew.

2418
02:55:28,343 --> 02:55:29,183
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Shane.

2419
02:55:30,344 --> 02:55:30,604
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2420
02:55:30,684 --> 02:55:31,345
[SPEAKER_07]: Bye, Shane.

2421
02:55:31,745 --> 02:55:33,527
[SPEAKER_07]: Bye.

2422
02:55:33,547 --> 02:55:37,970
[SPEAKER_07]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2423
02:55:38,610 --> 02:55:40,172
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to some tweets real quick.

2424
02:55:40,212 --> 02:55:42,555
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to do these pretty quick here because we're running kind of late tonight.

2425
02:55:43,256 --> 02:55:52,567
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkTetsuya sends the show a tweet that says, Hey, just to note, the latest version of Super Mario Crossover or 3.0 is now out and it's available at ExplodingRabbit.com.

2426
02:55:52,587 --> 02:55:53,868
[SPEAKER_07]: Did they do a Kickstarter for that one?

2427
02:55:54,489 --> 02:56:03,474
[SPEAKER_03]: No, they did a Kickstarter for their game that's not quite that game, but all the characters changed to slightly renamed and their own original levels.

2428
02:56:03,674 --> 02:56:04,474
[SPEAKER_07]: Got it, got it.

2429
02:56:06,015 --> 02:56:12,158
[SPEAKER_07]: Actdeft says the King of Fighters 13 Steam Edition trailer was leaked in the Steam store and removed.

2430
02:56:12,678 --> 02:56:16,000
[SPEAKER_07]: So King of Fighters 13 probably coming to Steam at some point.

2431
02:56:17,100 --> 02:56:45,018
[SPEAKER_07]: TigerClaw sent us a tweet Imagi Studios originally was going to make a Legend of Zelda movie check out the short movie pitch video and he linked us to YouTube I actually did see this earlier in the week and it did look pretty cool although there was no I don't believe there was any voices in it but it did it looked interesting but you know Nintendo is crazy possessive over their IPs ever since that Super Mario Brothers movie was a stink bomb so I'm not surprised they didn't get to go forward with it but it sure made a great little YouTube to look at

2432
02:56:45,979 --> 02:56:46,940
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you guys see that at all?

2433
02:56:47,101 --> 02:56:49,043
[SPEAKER_07]: The little concept, the Zelda pitch?

2434
02:56:49,344 --> 02:56:49,624
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

2435
02:56:49,824 --> 02:56:50,666
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it was neat.

2436
02:56:51,707 --> 02:56:56,193
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, I'll give it one more minute to see if anybody's going to call in, but if not, we'll close up shop.

2437
02:56:56,213 --> 02:56:59,918
[SPEAKER_07]: 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2438
02:57:00,419 --> 02:57:02,602
[SPEAKER_07]: Anybody else have a last-minute story for us tonight?

2439
02:57:03,447 --> 02:57:09,431
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, actually, not necessarily a story, but I'm going to start making my 3DS cases.

2440
02:57:10,151 --> 02:57:10,392
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah?

2441
02:57:10,632 --> 02:57:12,673
[SPEAKER_02]: And put them available to sell before too long.

2442
02:57:12,873 --> 02:57:13,614
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that an Etsy thing?

2443
02:57:14,094 --> 02:57:14,895
[SPEAKER_02]: I might do it on Etsy.

2444
02:57:15,435 --> 02:57:16,275
[SPEAKER_02]: Either that or Store Envy.

2445
02:57:16,315 --> 02:57:17,196
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm still deciding.

2446
02:57:17,556 --> 02:57:20,238
[SPEAKER_07]: And why would somebody want a 3DS case from DarkSakura?

2447
02:57:20,378 --> 02:57:25,021
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they are well-made and protect your system a lot better than those flip-open cases do.

2448
02:57:26,322 --> 02:57:26,742
[SPEAKER_07]: Fair enough.

2449
02:57:26,782 --> 02:57:28,183
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, we do have one more call coming in.

2450
02:57:28,223 --> 02:57:30,665
[SPEAKER_07]: This will probably be the last one for tonight, so let's go to it.

2451
02:57:30,705 --> 02:57:31,586
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2452
02:57:31,606 --> 02:57:31,966
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's this?

2453
02:57:35,148 --> 02:57:37,550
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello, it's Orange Lounge Radio.

2454
02:57:38,491 --> 02:57:38,831
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello.

2455
02:57:39,112 --> 02:57:39,552
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi.

2456
02:57:40,553 --> 02:57:41,013
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's this?

2457
02:57:42,034 --> 02:57:42,815
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, this is Actdeft.

2458
02:57:42,915 --> 02:57:44,316
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, Actdeft, and we see you.

2459
02:57:44,377 --> 02:57:45,698
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a video call.

2460
02:57:46,599 --> 02:57:47,159
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello.

2461
02:57:48,300 --> 02:57:49,501
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that a My Little Pony?

2462
02:57:50,722 --> 02:57:52,044
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's a Pokemon.

2463
02:57:52,204 --> 02:57:53,385
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, it's a Pokemon.

2464
02:57:53,405 --> 02:57:56,348
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh-oh, Shane's going to kill me for that one, too.

2465
02:57:56,368 --> 02:57:59,350
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I need to get my plus and minus ones back from Julie and send them to Shane.

2466
02:57:59,931 --> 02:58:00,792
[SPEAKER_07]: Which Pokemon is that?

2467
02:58:02,355 --> 02:58:12,948
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the Pokemon Black and White Legendary Rush Around Oh, okay, alright It's a Loki doll, so yeah So did you just call in tonight to show off your plushie?

2468
02:58:13,909 --> 02:58:20,978
[SPEAKER_01]: Not really, I want to talk about Pac-Man CDX Plus Ah, the game that Alan was talking about earlier, right?

2469
02:58:21,724 --> 02:58:27,847
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm pretty excited about it because I'm a fan of Pac-Man C or Championship Edition.

2470
02:58:27,887 --> 02:58:29,167
[SPEAKER_01]: I played the hell out of it.

2471
02:58:30,047 --> 02:58:37,571
[SPEAKER_01]: I even got in the tops, way in the beginning when it was released, I was in the top 40 scores of that game.

2472
02:58:37,931 --> 02:58:38,691
[SPEAKER_07]: Holy crap.

2473
02:58:39,091 --> 02:58:43,133
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, like I said, I played it a lot, like a freaking lot.

2474
02:58:43,829 --> 02:58:54,193
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm pretty excited to have or at least being able to play DX because what I have seen about it, it seems pretty damn cool.

2475
02:58:56,594 --> 02:59:01,796
[SPEAKER_01]: And mostly the reason, I haven't even been able to play it.

2476
02:59:05,023 --> 02:59:09,065
[SPEAKER_01]: It's because it's not available in Mexico for some reason.

2477
02:59:09,505 --> 02:59:10,125
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why.

2478
02:59:10,986 --> 02:59:14,467
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm pretty stoked that it's coming to Steam.

2479
02:59:14,847 --> 02:59:19,269
[SPEAKER_01]: Even since the announcement, it was a few months ago.

2480
02:59:19,289 --> 02:59:21,150
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember when exactly.

2481
02:59:22,211 --> 02:59:28,073
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm pretty excited to see it now being able to purchase ahead.

2482
02:59:29,014 --> 02:59:30,734
[SPEAKER_01]: Not to say pre-purchase or pre-order.

2483
02:59:33,527 --> 02:59:35,148
[SPEAKER_07]: You got everybody trained, DarkSakura.

2484
02:59:35,748 --> 02:59:36,068
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

2485
02:59:37,209 --> 02:59:41,291
[SPEAKER_07]: He took great care to make sure he said purchase ahead and not pre-purchase.

2486
02:59:41,351 --> 02:59:46,073
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, which is how it should be because it's wrong to put unnecessary prefix.

2487
02:59:46,093 --> 02:59:47,214
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't you listen to George Carlin?

2488
02:59:47,914 --> 02:59:48,574
[SPEAKER_02]: Jeez, Rob.

2489
02:59:50,175 --> 02:59:51,156
[SPEAKER_07]: How dare I speak up.

2490
02:59:51,796 --> 03:00:01,740
[SPEAKER_01]: The only sad part is that we have to wait at least one month and a half to be able to play it since it releases on the 25th

2491
03:00:03,533 --> 03:00:07,916
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, but the extra content will be pretty good too.

2492
03:00:08,457 --> 03:00:11,419
[SPEAKER_01]: The Ralliac skin, the Dick Duck skin.

2493
03:00:12,120 --> 03:00:17,864
[SPEAKER_01]: There's even old school Pac-Man skin, so that's going to be pretty cool.

2494
03:00:18,104 --> 03:00:21,167
[SPEAKER_07]: I just love that this game is how old and they're still supporting it.

2495
03:00:21,227 --> 03:00:25,070
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, this was really a pleasant surprise because it was at the point where the game was given...

2496
03:00:25,450 --> 03:00:25,930
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2497
03:00:25,950 --> 03:00:27,471
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, anything else you're looking forward to this year?

2498
03:00:53,154 --> 03:00:56,955
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, mostly this coming week, DuckTales, and everyone else.

2499
03:00:57,535 --> 03:00:58,936
[SPEAKER_07]: I bet Codeman's happy to hear that.

2500
03:00:58,976 --> 03:01:00,576
[SPEAKER_07]: What system are you getting DuckTales on?

2501
03:01:01,576 --> 03:01:04,497
[SPEAKER_01]: Most possibly Steam, but I'm still debating on it.

2502
03:01:04,817 --> 03:01:05,117
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

2503
03:01:05,678 --> 03:01:06,118
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah.

2504
03:01:06,738 --> 03:01:07,238
[SPEAKER_07]: Very cool.

2505
03:01:07,678 --> 03:01:13,260
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, well, Actdeft, we're going to let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thank you and your little Pokemon there for calling in, who's waving goodbye.

2506
03:01:13,620 --> 03:01:14,080
[SPEAKER_07]: Adorable.

2507
03:01:14,160 --> 03:01:14,280
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye.

2508
03:01:14,520 --> 03:01:15,380
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, bye, Actdeft.

2509
03:01:15,400 --> 03:01:16,060
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for the call.

2510
03:01:16,501 --> 03:01:17,361
[SPEAKER_07]: We love the video calls.

2511
03:01:17,401 --> 03:01:17,681
[SPEAKER_07]: Take care.

2512
03:01:19,722 --> 03:01:20,443
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, that's gonna do it.

2513
03:01:20,463 --> 03:01:21,804
[SPEAKER_02]: Shane never answered my question.

2514
03:01:21,904 --> 03:01:22,685
[SPEAKER_07]: What was the question?

2515
03:01:22,825 --> 03:01:25,026
[SPEAKER_02]: I was gonna see if he wanted my giant Togepi.

2516
03:01:25,066 --> 03:01:27,328
[SPEAKER_07]: He probably turned the show off, so don't give it to him.

2517
03:01:27,348 --> 03:01:28,009
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know what?

2518
03:01:28,129 --> 03:01:28,349
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

2519
03:01:28,549 --> 03:01:30,391
[SPEAKER_02]: Did I tell you how I got my giant Togepi?

2520
03:01:31,411 --> 03:01:34,154
[SPEAKER_02]: I got held up at gunpoint working at GNC.

2521
03:01:34,254 --> 03:01:35,415
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh god, yeah, I did.

2522
03:01:35,615 --> 03:01:36,636
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a horrible story.

2523
03:01:36,716 --> 03:01:39,838
[SPEAKER_02]: And I found $10 in the parking lot outside Toys R Us.

2524
03:01:41,480 --> 03:01:45,904
[SPEAKER_02]: And I went in and I used it to buy myself a giant Togepi.

2525
03:01:46,684 --> 03:01:47,605
[SPEAKER_02]: The $20 Togepi.

2526
03:01:47,825 --> 03:01:48,586
[SPEAKER_02]: You earned it.

2527
03:01:49,607 --> 03:01:53,691
[SPEAKER_02]: And so my giant Togepi was like my comfort creature thing.

2528
03:01:54,492 --> 03:01:55,393
[SPEAKER_02]: And my Charmander pillow.

2529
03:01:56,033 --> 03:01:58,134
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we have to wrap up the show, guys.

2530
03:01:58,514 --> 03:01:59,235
[SPEAKER_07]: It's about that time.

2531
03:01:59,255 --> 03:02:03,637
[SPEAKER_07]: We're running a little long tonight, and Alan and I still have errands to run after the show.

2532
03:02:04,117 --> 03:02:05,518
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're going to wrap up the show.

2533
03:02:06,338 --> 03:02:07,799
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to start with Alan tonight.

2534
03:02:07,859 --> 03:02:09,539
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much for being here tonight.

2535
03:02:10,060 --> 03:02:13,421
[SPEAKER_07]: Really appreciate you being on the show and lending your wit and so forth.

2536
03:02:13,441 --> 03:02:14,222
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't be a stranger.

2537
03:02:14,482 --> 03:02:15,402
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, you only live here.

2538
03:02:16,243 --> 03:02:18,144
[SPEAKER_07]: So do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

2539
03:02:21,286 --> 03:02:27,230
[SPEAKER_06]: If I can get my headset replaced, I might start doing like an achievement run in Half-Life for Twitch TV.

2540
03:02:27,410 --> 03:02:27,671
[SPEAKER_02]: Fun.

2541
03:02:27,991 --> 03:02:29,252
[SPEAKER_02]: You think it's time to go wireless?

2542
03:02:30,613 --> 03:02:30,933
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

2543
03:02:30,953 --> 03:02:32,354
[SPEAKER_06]: I've had bad experiences with wireless.

2544
03:02:33,475 --> 03:02:37,779
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you have like a Twitter you want to plug or anything you want to plug if people want to get your wit online?

2545
03:02:37,799 --> 03:02:38,639
[SPEAKER_07]: Because you are really funny.

2546
03:02:38,659 --> 03:02:40,201
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually am on Twitter a lot now.

2547
03:02:40,241 --> 03:02:44,124
[SPEAKER_06]: I finally got Twitter to like how it works.

2548
03:02:44,684 --> 03:02:45,825
[SPEAKER_06]: I always just ignore it.

2549
03:02:46,365 --> 03:02:48,327
[SPEAKER_06]: It's at salacious underscore pop.

2550
03:02:48,786 --> 03:02:50,769
[SPEAKER_07]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

2551
03:03:03,746 --> 03:03:31,072
[SPEAKER_07]: no, not really alright, and I will say my final thought tonight is I better be over this damn cold tomorrow because I need to get back to work, I have a ton of work to catch up on from being sick for two days and so this con play can kiss my ass DarkSakura, your final thought tonight I want a house and a job probably in that order in that order

2552
03:03:32,230 --> 03:03:33,251
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura
